injury after ischemic insult, which is an important cause of cell death in all cell types
within the neurovascular unit. To investigate whether PARP-1 plays an important role in
protecting the neurovascular unit following cerebral ischemia, we evaluated neurobehavioral deﬁcits, PARP-1 activity, blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption and neurovascular unit
deﬁcits using Western blot analysis, TTC staining and electron microscopy in an MCAO rat
model. The results revealed that PARP-1 enzymatic activity was dramatically increased
after ischemia. Inhibition of PARP-1 signiﬁcantly reduced the extent of both cerebral
infarction and edema, improved neurological scores, and attenuated the damage to the
neurovascular unit in cerebral ischemia. Collectively, these ﬁndings demonstrate that the
down-regulation of PARP-1 activity contributes to reducing post-ischemic brain damage via
protection of the neurovascular unit.

Introduction

Cerebral ischemia is the third leading cause of death throughout the world (Lloyd-Jones et al., 2009). Therapeutic strategies
aimed at attenuating brain injury after ischemic stroke have
been a major focus for the past 40 years. However, none of the
many neuroprotective strategies studied in clinical experiments
have produced the expected clinical outcomes (O‘’Collins et al.,
2006; Savitz and Fisher, 2007). The classic therapeutic approach,
known as the “thrombolytic approach,” consists of rapid recovery of the occluded blood to the ischemic region, thus attenuating the neurological damage (Lo et al., 2003). The only drug
therapy available in clinical settings is recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator (rt-PA). However, due to the narrow
therapeutic window and hemorrhagic complications, only a
minority of patients receive rt-PA therapy. Further analyses
have documented that the key reason for these failures may be
that only a single therapeutic target is pursued and that the
interactions among the various components of the neurovascular unit (NVU) are neglected (Xue et al., 2013). Indeed, to
obtain substantial and long-lasting neuroprotection, not only
neurons but all of the components of the NVU, such as glia,
endothelia, pericytes and basal membranes, should be targeted
during an ischemic insult (Iadecola et al., 2006). Hence, there is
an urgent need to develop effective neuroprotective agents that
combine multi-target and multi-level therapy. To achieve this
goal, an increasing number of strategies for ischemic neuroprotection through various targets have been proposed and
evaluated in preclinical settings. However, these targets, which
include all components of the NVU, increase the already
substantial complexity and decrease the feasibility of obtaining
ischemic neuroprotection by pharmacological approaches.
Recent comprehensive ﬁndings from various cerebral ischemia
models have demonstrated that the direct activation of poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), especially PARP-1, which is a
key mediator of ischemic injury, plays an important role in
neuroprotection against cerebral necrosis and apoptosis
(Chiarugi, 2005; Kauppinen et al., 2009; Matsuura et al., 2011;
Moroni, 2008). Therefore, we speculate that the regulation of
PARP-1 activity may be one of the most efﬁcacious means of
protecting the NVU currently available.
PARP-1 is the most abundant of several PARP family members
and is activated by binding to DNA strand breaks under many
oxidative stress-related conditions (Castri et al., 2014). The
hyperactivation of PARP-1 after cerebral ischemia occurs not
only in neurons but also in astrocytes, microglia, endothelia,
pericytes and inﬁltrating leukocytes, and this effect contributes
to cell death through a process involving excessive ATP and
NADþ depletion, the release of inﬂammatory factors and free
radicals, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation from
the mitochondria to the nucleus (Castri et al., 2014; Kauppinen
et al., 2009; Moroni, 2008). Previous studies have demonstrated
that the inhibition of PARP-1 activation by PARP-1 gene knockout
or pharmacological inhibitors (PJ-34, 3-AB and MP-124) following
focal cerebral ischemia could drastically reduce the ischemiainduced neurological damage (Hamby et al., 2007; Matsuura
et al., 2011; Shimizu et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2014; Yap et al.,
2008). It has been suggested that PARP-1 may be a crucial
cofactor of NVU disruptions leading to cerebral injury.

Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the
protective role of PARP-1 down-regulation within the NVU
following cerebral ischemia. First, we established a model of
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); then, we evaluated
whether the down-regulation of PARP-1 could ameliorate
neurobehavioral deﬁcits, blood brain barrier (BBB) disruptions
and synaptic deﬁcits using small hairpin RNA (shRNA), TTC
staining, Western blot analysis and electron microscopy.

Results

2.1.
PARP-1 activation was induced by cerebral ischemia
in rats
During ischemia, PARP-1 is activated by DNA breaks and
cleaved into two fragments that measure 24 and 89 kDa. Thus,
we chose PARP-1 cleavage (89 kDa) as a marker of PARP-1
activity. The protein expression of PARP-1 cleavage was quantiﬁed by Western blotting at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 24 h and 3 d postMCAO (Fig. 1). Densitometric analysis demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase in protein levels in the rats at 1 h and 3 h postMCAO compared with those in sham animals (po0.01, po0.01,
Fig. 1). Compared with the 1 h group, PARP-1 expression was
drastically reduced in rats 6 h after MCAO (po0.01, po0.01).

2.2.
PARP-1 expression in rats was suppressed by
treatment with LV-PARP1-shRNA
LV-PARP1-shRNA was successfully transfected into more
than 70% of neurons 72 h after infection at an MOI of 5
(Fig. 2). ShRNA1, shRNA2 and shRNA3 all suppressed PARP-1
expression notably (po0.01, Fig. 2), while no knock-out effect
was observed in the negative control group (LV-control-

2.3.
Effects of PARP-1 activation on neurobehavioral
scores in rats with cerebral ischemia
The neurological deﬁcits were scored in all of the rats for all
experimental groups at 24 h post-MCAO. Compared with the
neurobehavioral scores of the sham group, the scores of the rats
exposed to MCAO were signiﬁcantly increased [F(3,28) ¼56.597,
po0.01, Fig. 4]. The neurobehavioral scores of the LV-PARP1shRNA group were remarkably lower than those of the LVcontrol-shRNA group (po0.01). However, no differences were
observed in the LV-control-shRNA rats compared to the MCAO
rats (p40.05).

2.4.
Effects of PARP-1 activation on infarct volume in rats
with cerebral ischemia

shRNA). Therefore, we randomly chose shRNA1 for further
experiments.
The PARP-1 mRNA expressed after RNA interference was
quantiﬁed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3). The results showed that PARP-1
mRNA was signiﬁcantly decreased in rats 3 days after LVPARP1-shRNA interference compared to the control group
(po0.01). Additionally, a considerable decrease in PARP-1
mRNA was observed 5 and 8 days after RNA interference
compared with that in the control rats (po0.01, po0.01).
However, no differences were observed in rats 1 d after RNA

As shown in Fig. 5A, TTC staining revealed clear differences
between the levels of viable brain tissues, which were stained a
deep red color, and damaged tissue, which appeared as an
unstained white mass. The corresponding infarct volumes
showed the extent of brain damage and are illustrated in
Fig. 5B. Quantitative analysis revealed that the infarct volumes
in the MCAO rats were markedly different from those of the
non-operated sham group (po0.01, Fig. 5), but these values were
not signiﬁcantly different from those of the LV-control-shRNA
group (p40.05). Additionally, a considerable reduction in infarct
volume was observed in the LV-PARP1-shRNA group compared
to both the MCAO and LV-control-shRNA groups (po0.01).

Permeability of the BBB

The brain water content and Evans blue dye extravasation were
used to evaluate the permeability of the BBB (Fig. 6). The results
demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase in brain water content in
the MCAO and LV-control-shRNA groups (po0.01, po0.01)
compared to the sham rats (Fig. 6A and B). However, no
difference was observed between the MCAO and LV-controlshRNA groups (p40.05). Compared to the LV-control-shRNA

Myelin sheath

Ultrastructural analysis showed that the myelin sheaths of
nerve ﬁbers appeared to be normal in the sham group.
However, the myelin sheaths of MCAO rats were thinner than
those of the sham group, and delamination of the nerve ﬁbers
was observed in the MCAO group (Fig. 7). In the LV-PARP1shRNA group, the nerve ﬁbers were well preserved compared
to those of the MCAO and LV-control-shRNA rats (Fig. 7).

2.5.4.

Glia

The glial ultrastructural morphology appeared to be normal
in the sham group with intact nuclei and evenly distributed
chromatin and organelles (Fig. 7). In the MCAO and LVcontrol-shRNA groups, cell shrinkage and a loss of cellular
organelles were observed in the ischemic area (Fig. 7). However, most of the glia and their organelles appeared to be
normal, and fewer of the above-mentioned pathological
changes were observed in the LV-PARP1-shRNA group (Fig. 7).

group, the brain water content was dramatically decreased in
the rats exposed to LV-PARP1-shRNA (po0.01).
With regard to these results, a notable increase in EB
leakage was observed in both the MCAO and LV-controlshRNA groups compared to the sham group (po0.01, po0.01,
Fig. 6C), while a signiﬁcant reduction was observed in the LVPARP1-shRNA group (po0.01).

2.5.2.

Neurons

The electron microscopy results showed that the ultrastructures of most neurons in the sham group were normal
and mainly consisted of intact and smooth nuclear membranes, well-distributed chromatin and normal organelles
(Fig. 7). However, incomplete nuclear membranes, uneven
and scarce chromatin, sparse cytoplasm, and rare and
destructive organelles were observed in the MCAO and LVcontrol-shRNA groups (Fig. 7). The neurons in the PARP-1
shRNA rats showed relatively intact nuclear membranes,
prominent nuclei and abundant organelles (Fig. 7).

BBB

The blood brain barrier in the sham group exhibited capillary
integrity with normal basal lamina and endothelial cells.
Extensive tight junctions were observed with points and lines
of fusion between the external leaﬂets of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7). However, in the MCAO and control shRNA
groups, the integrity of the BBB was seriously damaged, the
lumen of capillaries was collapsed, and endothelial cells and
their nuclei were swollen and deformed (Fig. 7). These structural deﬁcits of the BBB were alleviated in the PARP-1 shRNA
group compared to the control shRNA group. The endothelial
cells, basal lamina and tight junctions were preserved, and the
swelling of endothelial cells was attenuated (Fig. 7).

2.5.6.

Synapses

There were no signiﬁcant differences in synaptic density
among the Sham, MCAO, LV-control-shRNA and LV-PARP1shRNA groups detected by transmission electron microscopy
(Fig. 7). Structural alterations to individual synapses were
examined by measuring the maximum head diameter, postsynaptic density (PSD) length, synaptic curvature, synaptic
vesicle number per terminal, and synaptic vesicle diameter.
The results showed that synapses in the MCAO group were
seriously damaged with signiﬁcant decreases in the PSD
length, maximum head diameter, synaptic vesicle number
per terminal and synaptic vesicle diameter. The synaptic
curvature was signiﬁcantly altered, with a lower percentage
of ﬂat synapses compared to the Sham group (Fig. 7). However,
synapses in the LV-PARP1-shRNA group were markedly different from those observed in the MCAO rats, which in turn were
indistinguishable from those in the LV-control-shRNA rats.
The mean values of the above-mentioned indicators were
approximately normal in the LV-PARP1-shRNA group, and no
major differences were observed in the Sham rats (Fig. 7).

attenuation of cerebral ischemic damage via the inhibition of
PARP-1 activation was achieved through protection of the NVU,
including neurons, glia and the BBB, during cerebral ischemia.
Cerebral ischemia is a major cause of disability and mortality
throughout the world (Ceña et al., 2014). The only drug therapy
available for ischemic stroke is recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator, which has a narrow therapeutic window and may
produce hemorrhagic complications. For various reasons, a major
cause of treatment failure in the clinical setting is treating a
single therapeutic target while ignoring the interactions among
the various components of the NVU, despite the complex and
multifactorial nature of ischemia. Obviously, it is not sufﬁcient to
protect neurons from excitotoxic insults only. To reduce brain
damage after ischemia, it is necessary to rescue all cellular and
structural components of the NVU. The concept of the NVU was
ﬁrst proposed in 2003 (Lo et al., 2003), and it refers to an overall
structure and functional unit that includes neurons, glial cells,
endothelial cells, pericytes, basement membranes, microglia cells
and the extracellular matrix. The NVU emphasizes the dynamic
interactions among its components and their important inﬂuence
on the pathophysiology of ischemia (Xue et al., 2013).
Our results revealed that all components of the NVU dysfunction induced by cerebral ischemia, including abnormalities in BBB
permeability, edema, neuronal and glial degeneration and synaptic
disruption, were mediated by the activation of PARP-1. The latter
ﬁnding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that
PARP-1 enzymatic activity is increased after ischemia, although
PARP-1 protein expression is not altered (Hu et al., 2013; Nagayama
et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2014). The activation of PARP-1 after

ischemia may be relevant to the subsequent neurovascular deﬁcits.
In the present study, PARP-1 inhibition produced signiﬁcant
neuroprotection by reducing the infarct size and edema volume
and attenuating the damage to the NVU after cerebral ischemia.
These results are supported by previous studies in which PARP-1
inhibitors or gene deletion attenuated neurological damage in
experimental models of cerebral ischemia (Hamby et al., 2007;
Matsuura et al., 2011; Shimizu et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2014; Teng
et al., 2013; Yap et al., 2008). Neurological impairments can be
alleviated by PARP-1 inhibition, indicating that PARP-1 may be a
key cofactor in NVU disruptions leading to cerebral injury (Chiarugi,
2005; Kauppinen et al., 2009; Matsuura et al., 2011; Moroni, 2008).
PARP-1 is the most abundant of several PARP family members
able to catalyze the transfer of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADþ) to form poly ADP-ribose (PAR) on target proteins in the
nuclei; these factors play key roles in the maintenance of genomic
integrity, chromatin structure, gene transcription and expression,
and the cell cycle (Ji and Tulin, 2010; Schreiber et al., 2006). PARP-1
has two distinct regions, an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain
and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain, and it is activated by
binding to DNA strand breaks under many oxidative stress-related
conditions (Castri et al., 2014). It is generally accepted that excessive
PARP-1 activation can modulate disruption of the integrity of the
NVU under many oxidative stress-related conditions, including
cerebral ischemia, through various molecular mechanisms. A
previous study implied that extensive PARP-1 activation causes
cell death by the depletion of NADþ, resultant energy failure, and
mitochondrial dysfunction (Baxter et al., 2014). It was subsequently
demonstrated that excessive PARP-1 activation may cause the

translocation of AIF from the mitochondria to the nucleus, thus
activating a caspase-independent type of apoptosis that has been
called parthanatos (Moroni, 2008; Vosler et al., 2009). Additionally,

PARP-1 also enhances the abundant expression and release of free
radicals and inﬂammatory factors (NF-кB, iNOS, ICAM-1, TNF, IL-6,
etc.) (Castri et al., 2014; Hamby et al., 2007; Hu et al., 2013;

Kauppinen et al., 2009). It has been shown that minocycline and
other tetracyclines prevent neuron death in N-methyl-N0 -nitro-Nnitrosoguanidine (MNNG) models, and it has been proposed that
this effect is directly caused by inhibiting PARP-1 activity (Alano,
2006). Additionally, the administration of a PARP-1 inhibitor (PJ34)
after ischemia has been shown to produce a substantial protective
effect on neuronal survival and neurogenesis by suppressing
inﬂammation, thus suggesting that inﬂammation is the responsible
molecular mechanism whereby PARP-1 mediates post-ischemic
brain damage (Hamby et al., 2007; Kauppinen et al., 2009). In
parallel with these studies, our results revealed that PARP-1 mRNA
silencing markedly ameliorated ultrastructural damage to the NVU
(including damage to neurons, glia and the BBB), reduced cerebral
infarct volume, and improved neurological function in rats with
cerebral ischemia. In addition, the present results also showed that
PARP-1 mRNA silencing contributed to a remarkable reduction in
EB leakage and brain water content, which was supported by a
previous study demonstrating that PARP-1 activation contributed to
BBB disruption by activating matrix metalloproteinase-9 and promoting cell death in the endothelial and glial cells that form the
BBB (Moroni, 2008). In contrast, a recent study has demonstrated
that PARP-1 activation without subsequent NADþ depletion following mild transient ischemia is neuroprotective in the brain
(Nagayama et al., 2000). However, our results showed that PARP-1
inhibition reduced the infarct volume and remarkably alleviated
neurological deﬁcits. A previous study of an in vitro model of
ischemia induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) illustrated
the neuroprotective effects of NADþ repletion and reported that
cellular NADþ replenishment remarkably reduced OGD-induced
cell death and DNA damage (Wang et al., 2008). Therefore, we
speculate that the levels of cellular NADþ may be an important
factor in this process.
Nevertheless, the present study was performed on male rats
only. Several studies have suggested signiﬁcant differences
between male and female responses to PARP-1 inhibitors. A
recent study showed that deletion of the PARP-1 gene reduced
infarct volume in males but exacerbated post-ischemic brain
damage in females (Liu et al., 2011). However, another experiment
demonstrated that a PARP-1 inhibitor signiﬁcantly decreased the
ischemic infarct volume in females but affected males to a lesser
degree (Moroni et al., 2012). It is possible that PARP-1 activity is
selectively increased in males, and not all of the proposed
mechanisms of PARP-1 inhibition that induce neuroprotection
are equally expressed in males and females. Thus, it will be
important to extend these studies in female subjects.
In conclusion, the present study conﬁrmed that PARP-1
mRNA silencing reduced the cerebral infarct volume and
edema and improved neurological function by alleviating
neuronal cell apoptosis, BBB disruption, and synaptic deﬁcits
after focal cerebral ischemia.

shRNA design and detection

Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (280720 g) were purchased
from the Shandong Medical University Experimental Animal
Center (Jinan, China) and housed at the Qianfoshan Hospital
Experimental Animal Center (Jinan, China). The animals were
maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle at a constant temperature (2372 1C) and humidity with ad libitum access to food

For the PARP-1 shRNA experiment, three target sequences
were chosen according to the Ambion shRNA design online
tool (NM-013063): (1) shRNA1: 50 -CCAAAGGAATTCCGAGAAA30 ; (2) shRNA2: 50 -GGACAAGGAGAGTAGTAAA-30 ; and (3)

4.2.

Cell culture and transfection

Neuron cultures were prepared from the hippocampi of 24-h-old
Sprague Dawley rats (Shandong Medical University Experimental
Animal Center, Jinan, China) and plated onto 6-well Falcon
culture plates coated with poly-D-lysine overnight (BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA). The neurons were cultured in Dulbecco‘’s modiﬁed Eagle‘’s minimal essential medium (DMEM;
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Ogden, Utah, USA) at 37 1C in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. When the
neurons had grown to 90% conﬂuence, the LV-scrambledshRNA and LV-PARP1-shRNAs were infected at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 5. The neurons were divided into ﬁve groups:
the control group (CON, normal neurons), the negative control
group (NC, LV-control-shRNA), and the shRNA1, shRNA2 and
shRNA3 groups. After three days, the neurons were analyzed
using real-time PCR for PARP-1 expression to select the shRNA
knock-out PARP-1 mRNA for further animal experiments.

4.3.

Rt-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from cultured neurons using a Total
RNA Puriﬁcation Kit (Omega, USA). The RNA quality and quantity
were determined using a spectrophotometer (K5600, Beijing
Kaiao Technology Development Co., Ltd., Beijing, China), and
the RNA was reverse transcribed using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT
Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Real-time
quantitative PCR was performed in the Lightcycler system (ABI
Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System, PE Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, California, USA) with Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR
Master Mix (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was chosen as the reference gene. To amplify both PARP-1 and GAPDH,
the following PCR protocol was applied: an initial incubation at
95 1C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles at 95 1C for 15 s, 60 1C for
30 s, and 72 1C for 30 s. The experiments were performed in
triplicate. The following speciﬁc primers were used: PARP-1: 50 TCCCAGAACAAGGACGAAGC-30 (forward) and 50 -CCTCACACACGACTCGAACA-30 (reverse); GAPDH: 50 -CCTTCCGTGTTCCTACCC30 (forward) and 50 -CAACCTGGTCCTCAGTGTAG-30 (reverse). The
results were analyzed by the threshold cycle (CT), which is
correlated with the level of target mRNA. The ampliﬁed transcripts were quantiﬁed using the comparative CT method with
the formula for relative fold change¼ 2  ΔΔCT.

were approved by the Qianfoshan Hospital Animal Care

A total of 140 rats were randomly divided into the following four
groups: sham, Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO), MCAO

with LV-PARP1-shRNA (PARP-1 shRNA). The animals in each group
were then assigned to ﬁve subgroups for neurological assessment,
TTC staining, Evans blue leakage, brain water content and electron
microscopy. Furthermore, an additional 18 rats were used to
evaluate the suppression efﬁcacy of LV-PARP1-shRNA after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection into the brain; the PARP-1 activity
in another 18 rats was analyzed by Western blotting.

4.5.

MCAO models

Permanent focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle
cerebral artery occlusion as described previously (Longa et al.,
1989). Brieﬂy, the right common carotid artery (CCA), internal
carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) were
exposed under anesthesia with 10% chloral hydrate. A siliconcoated nylon ﬁlament (0.28–0.35 mm in diameter and 18–19 mm
long, determined by the weight of the rats) with a ﬂame-rounded
tip of HZ-704 silica gel (DuoLunDuoDianQiMiFengJianChang,
Wuxi, China) was introduced from the ECA into the lumen of
the ICA until it blocked the origin of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA) to occlude the right MCA. Throughout the experiment,
physiological parameters (arterial blood pressure, blood gases
and glucose concentration) were monitored and maintained
within the normal range. The rectal temperature was maintained at 37.070.5 1C using a feedback-controlled heating pad.
Sham-operated animals were subjected to a similar surgical
procedure except without the insertion of a suture. According
to a ﬁve-point scale used in a previous study (Longa et al., 1989),
rats exhibiting detectable neurological deﬁcits (score of 2–3) after
MCAO were regarded as successfully established stroke models.
Rats that were not successfully established, exhibited seizures or
died after MCAO were excluded from the experiments.

4.6.

Treatments

The rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (300 mg/
kg) and ﬁxed on a stereotaxic apparatus (Narishige, Tokyo,
Japan). LV-PARP1-shRNA/LV-control- shRNA (5 ml, 1  109 transducing units [TU]/ml) was injected into the right lateral ventricle (0.8 mm posterior to the bregma, 1.5 mm lateral from the
midline and 2.5 mm ventral to the cortical surface) at a rate of
1 ml/min using a Hamilton microsyringe (Hamilton Company,
Reno, Nevada, USA). After surgery, the rats were housed
separately, and experiments were performed 14 days later.
To determine if the LV- PARP1-shRNA could be transfected
into the neurons and suppress the expression of PARP-1,
PARP-1 mRNA (1 d, 3 d, 5 d and 8 d after RNA interference)
was measured by PCR as described above.

4.7.

Neurobehavioral assessment

Neurological deﬁcits were evaluated at 24 h post-MCAO. The
neurological deﬁcits were scored as the following: (0) no
neurological deﬁcit (normal); (1) ﬂexion, failure to extend left
forepaw fully; (2) circling, circular movement in a clockwise
direction; (3) hemiparesis, falling to the left; and (4) nonspontaneity, failure to walk spontaneously.

4.8.

Western blotting

Western blot analysis was performed to determine whether
the PARP-1 protein was activated after ischemia. Rats without
PARP-1 RNA interference were decapitated at 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 24 h
or 3 d post MCAO or 24 h after the sham operation. Tissue
from the entire ischemic hemisphere was homogenized in
lysis buffer on ice. The total protein content was determined
by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Equal amounts (50 mg) of total
protein samples were mixed with 5  sample buffer and then
separated by Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After separation, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Billerica,
Massachusetts, USA) and blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk
in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). The membranes were then
incubated with an anti-PARP-1 primary antibody (1:200 dilution, AB194586, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) and an
antibody speciﬁc for β-actin (1:4000 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, Missouri, USA) as a control at 4 1C overnight. After
washing with TBSþTween (TBS-T) for three times, the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody at room
temperature for 1 h. Immunoreactivity was quantiﬁed by a gel
densitometric scanning program using the Microcomputer
Imaging Device (MCID, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada) image
analysis system. Quantitative results were obtained by measuring the band density and are expressed as the ratio of the
target protein to β-actin expression.

4.9.

TTC staining

TTC staining was conducted to assess the infarct volume. At 24 h
following MCAO, the rats (n¼8 in each group) were anesthetized
and transcardially perfused with sterile saline and paraformaldehyde as previously described. Serial coronal sections (2-mm
thick) were sliced from the adult rat brain matrix (RWD Life
Science Co. Ltd.). The slices were stained in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37 1C in
the dark for 30 min. The infarct area was measured by Image
Proplus 6.0. The percentage of the infarct volume to the total
brain volume was calculated as a dependent variable.

4.10.

Brain water content

The water content of the brain was evaluated using the wet/dry
method as previously described (Park et al., 2004). In brief, at 24 h
post-MCAO, the brains (n¼ 6) were removed immediately and
divided into ischemic and contralateral hemispheres. The
ischemic hemispheres were weighed (wet weight) using an
electronic analytical balance (BSA224S, Sartorius) and then dried
at 110 1C for 24 h and reweighed (dry weight). The brain water

brain research 1624 (2015) 9–18

content was calculated using the formula: brain water content¼
[(wet weight dry weight) wet weight]  100%.

4.11.

Evans blue dye extravasation

Evans blue (EB) leakage was measured 24 h after the MCAO to
assess the BBB permeability (n¼ 6). According to a previous
study (Park et al., 2004), EB (4% in saline, 2.5 ml/kg, Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) was administered intravenously and allowed to
circulate for 1 h before euthanizing the rats. The animals were
then transcardially perfused with sterile saline to eliminate the
intravascular dye. The amount of extravasated EB (mg/g) in the
brain was measured at 610 nm by spectrophotometry.

4.12.

Electron microscopy

Electron microscopy was carried out as previously described
(Miranda et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, brains were removed immediately under 10% chloral hydrate anesthesia, sliced into 1 mm3
slabs, and post-ﬁxed in glutaraldehyde overnight at 4 1C.
Brain sections were ﬁxed in 2% osmium, dehydrated in
graded ethanol and ﬂat-embedded in epon 812 (EMS Co.,
Ltd., Washington, USA). Thereafter, 50 nm-thick ultra-thin
sections were loaded on a Formvar/Carbon-coated grid, double stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then
visualized under a transmission electron microscope (JEM1200EX, Japanese electronics company, Tokyo, Japan).

4.13.

Statistical analysis

All data are presented as the mean7standard error of the
mean (SEM). Comparisons between groups were performed
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the
Student–Newman–Keuls test and the least signiﬁcant difference procedure. Statistical analyses were performed with
SPSS 16.0 for Windows. A probability level of po0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
