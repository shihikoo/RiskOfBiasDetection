ABSTRACT: A sensitive analytical technique for visualizing small endogenous
molecules simultaneously is of great signiﬁcance for clearly elucidating metabolic
mechanisms during pathological progression. In the present study, 1,5naphthalenediamine (1,5-DAN) hydrochloride was prepared for matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of small
molecules in liver, brain, and kidneys from mice. Furthermore, 1,5-DAN
hydrochloride assisted LDI MSI of small molecules in brain tissue of rats subjected
to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was carried out to investigate the
altered metabolic pathways and mechanisms underlying the development of
ischemic brain damage. Our results suggested that the newly prepared matrix
possessed brilliant features including low cost, strong ultraviolet absorption, high
salt tolerance capacity, and fewer background signals especially in the low mass
range (typically m/z < 500), which permitted us to visualize the spatial distribution of a broad range of small molecule
metabolites including metal ions, amino acids, carboxylic acids, nucleotide derivatives, peptide, and lipids simultaneously.
Nineteen endogenous metabolites involved in metabolic networks such as ATP metabolism, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
glutamate-glutamine cycle, and malate-aspartate shuttle, together with metal ions and phospholipids as well as antioxidants
underwent relatively obvious changes after 24 h of MCAO. The results were highly consistent with the data obtained by MRM
MS analysis. These ﬁndings highlighted the promising potential of the organic salt matrix for application in the ﬁeld of
biomedical research.

T

to now. Considering its prevalence and severe consequences,
elucidation of the metabolic mechanisms underlying cerebral
ischemia is of great signiﬁcance for minimizing the severity of
ischemic damage.
Rodent animal models are commonly used in the
investigations of mechanisms of ischemic cerebral injury and
the development of novel anti-ischemic drugs. MCAO using
the intraluminal suture in rodents is a widely accepted and wellstandardized animal model to study the pathogenesis of focal
cerebral ischemia.14 Various techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),15 nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR),5,8,15 online electrochemical monitoring,16,17
and positron emission tomography (PET)18 have been applied
for investigation of metabolic changes in rat brain following

he human brain is very sensitive to ischemia as it
consumes about one-ﬁfth of the oxygen and glucose.1,2
According to the American Heart Association, stroke ranks only
behind cancer and cardiac disease as one of the leading causes
of death and a major cause of disability. Among the most
frequently occurring types of stroke, ischemic stroke accounts
for almost 80% of the total cases in China and Western
countries.3 In the case of cerebral ischemia, restricted delivery
of oxygen and glucose would aﬀect the synthesis and
metabolism of ATP, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and its related
metabolic pathways such as glutamate-glutamine cycle and
malate-aspartate shuttle.4−7 Furthermore, disturbance of inﬂux
and eﬄux of metal ions8 as well as alterations of antioxidant
substances5,9 also occurred. Accompanied with these events are
the ischemic cascades such as acidosis,10 inﬂammation,11
excessive generation of reactive oxygen species,12 necrosis,
apoptosis, and eventually neuronal death.13 Pathophysiological
mechanisms of cerebral ischemia are extremely complicated,
and our ability to prevent and cure strokes remains limited up

brain tissues of a MCAO rat model permitted us to visualize the
spatial distribution and alteration of a broad range of small
molecule metabolites including metal ions, amino acids,
carboxylic acids, nucleotide derivatives, peptide, and lipids
simultaneously. These ﬁndings suggest that the newly prepared
organic salt matrix has potential application in small molecule in
situ MSI and in the ﬁeld of biomedical research.

MCAO. Nevertheless, information regarding the spatial localization of metabolites which is indispensable for accurately
understanding complex biological processes cannot be obtained
by using HPLC, NMR, and electrochemical techniques.
Except for analytical techniques mentioned above, MALDITOF MS has also been used for investigation of metabolic
changes in rat brain following MCAO. Experiments by Wang et
al.19 directly proﬁled the changes of phospholipids and
lysophospholipids in rat brain extracts postischemia using
MALDI-TOF MS. A previous study by our group20 monitored
level changes of glucose in rat brain microdialysates after
MCAO by MALDI-TOF MS. In addition, a remarkable new
technology, MALDI MSI, which was introduced by Caprioli in
199721 and emerged as a blooming ﬁeld among the numerous
imaging applications, has also been utilized for investigation of
metabolic alterations during the ischemic period. Comparing
with conventional imaging techniques, MALDI-MSI has
demonstrated its unique features, namely, no necessity of
labeling, high sensitivity, high throughout, molecule-speciﬁc,
and the capacity of in situ localizing a wide range of
biomolecules simultaneously from a tissue specimen in one
single run. Accompanied with technological and methodological improvements in the instrumentation, sample preparation, and data acquisition and handling, MALDI-MSI has
currently become one of the most powerful technologies for its
promising potential in the ﬁeld of biomedical research and has
found application prospects in disease diagnosis and
prognosis,22 biomarker discovery,23 and drug development.24
Koizumi et al. performed MALDI-MSI on rat brain sections 24
h after MCAO and revealed the production of lysophosphatidylcholine in the injured ischemic rat brain.25
Whitehead et al.26 examined the spatial proﬁle of ganglioside
species using MALDI MSI following MCAO reperfusion injury
in the mouse. Another study by MALDI MSI identiﬁed 11
upregulated phospholipids and 7 other downregulated
phospholipids in ischemic-damaged regions.27 MALDI-MSI
with 9-aminoacridine (9-AA) visualized changes in the
spatiotemporal distributions of eight cerebral metabolites
involved in glycosis, TCA cycle, glutamate-glutamine cycle,
and malate-aspartate shuttle in response to pathological
perturbation.4 By combining MSI with LC-MS, Irie et al.6
observed a region-speciﬁc metabolic behavior in amino acid and
nucleotide metabolism as well as in the TCA cycle in the
ischemic hemisphere.
It is generally believed that the detection of molecules in
MALDI analysis is to a great extent dependent on the choice of
matrix. Many novel promising matrices, such as porous
silicon,28 nanomaterials,29 and organic matrices,20,30−32 have
sprung up in recent years. Although those previous MALDI
MSI studies provided spatial information and changes of
metabolites during the process of ischemia, the range of the
metabolites is still limited and insuﬃcient to understand the
complex disease processes. In order to obtain as much
information simultaneously about altered metabolic pathways
and networks during the progress of ischemia, 1,5-DAN
hydrochloride was prepared as a matrix in the present study
from its precursor 1,5-DAN, an organic matrix for MALDI
analysis.32−34 Like other organic salts for a matrix springing up
in recent years,20,35,36 the newly prepared matrix possessed
brilliant features including low cost, strong ultraviolet
absorption, high salt tolerance capacity, and fewer background
signals especially in the low mass range (typically m/z < 500).

EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Chemicals and Reagents. 1,5-DAN, 9-AA, and 1,8bis(dimethylamino)naphthalene (DMAN) for matrix preparation, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) for tissue
staining, and chloral hydrate for anesthesia were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Standards including
aspartate, taurine, glutamate, glutamine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, N-acetylaspartate, ascorbic acid, citric acid, creatine,
glucose, glutathione, adenosine, inosine, AMP, ADP, ATP,
maltose, maltotriose, and peptide standard mixture were also
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Artiﬁcial
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF) II was bought from Huzhou
InnoReagents Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang, China).
Animals. Three male Kunming mice (20−22 g) and ten
Sprague−Dawley rats (250−260 g) were provided by the
Experimental Animal Center of Peking University. The animal
experiments were performed according to the NIH Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of
Health Publication, No. 3040-2, revised 1999, Bethesda, MD)
and were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Establishment of the MCAO Model. The MCAO was
carried out as described by Longa et al.37 with little
modiﬁcation. In brief, animals (n = 7) were anesthetized by
intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg), and a
short cervical incision was made on the rats. The right common
carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and
internal carotid artery (ICA) were surgically exposed and
separated from adjacent nerves and surrounding tissues. The
CCA and ECA were permanently ligated, and a silk suture was
loosely tied around the ICA. A nylon monoﬁlament of 40 mm
length with the tip coated with poly-L-lysine (ﬁnal tip diameter
of 0.36 ± 0.02 mm) (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing,
China) was inserted gently through the V-notch cut between
carotid bifurcation and the ligation of CCA and impelled nearly
18−20 mm. The nylon thread was ﬁxed to the CCA at the
notch, and the cervical incision was sutured. The shamoperated control group rats (n = 3) underwent the same
surgical operation except for the insertion of nylon monoﬁlament. The body temperature of the animals was maintained at
37 ± 1 °C throughout the whole surgery. Neurological
evaluation was performed according to a 5-points scale as
described in the literature.37 Furthermore, the brain tissue
sections were stained with TTC (Supporting Information) in
order to identify regions of necrosis.
Sample Preparation. Preparation of Matrixes and
Standard Solutions. Solutions of DMAN, 9-AA, 1,5-DAN,
and 1,5-DAN hydrochloride for matrix and mixture standard
solutions containing small molecules are prepared according to
the methods described in the Supporting Information.
Tissue Dissecting. Sprague−Dawley rats were euthanized
with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.) at 24 h post MCAO, and
then brain tissues were removed and snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen. Liver, brain, and kidneys tissues from normal
Kunming mice were dissected and ﬂash-frozen as the same

method. All tissues were stored at −80 °C until further
preparation.
Tissue Sectioning. Tissues were ﬁxed atop a drop of saline
on the cutting stage. All tissues were sectioned at 10 μm
thickness using a Leica CM1950 cryostat (Leica Microsystems
GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) at −17 ◦C and thaw mounted onto
indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass slides. The glass slides
were then placed into a vacuum desiccator for approximately 1
h before matrix application.
Plasma and Tissue Homogenate Preparation. Preparation
of plasma sample and tissue homogenates are according to the
methods described in the Supporting Information.
Quantitative Analysis of Metabolites in Tissue
Homogenates with MRM MS. Quantitative analysis of
metabolites in brain tissue homogenates of rat subjected to
MCAO was performed on an AB Sciex QTrap 4500 mass
spectrometer using scheduled multiple reaction monitoring
(MRM) via an electrospray ionization (ESI) source in both
positive and negative modes. A 5 μL aliquot of the sample was
injected directly through a bipass into MS without chromatography separation. Nitrogen was used for the collision gas.
Curtain gas (CUR), nebulizer gas (GS1), and turbo-gas (GS2)
were set at 25, 45, and 50 psi, respectively. The electrospray
voltage was set at 5.5 kV, and the turbo ion spray source
temperature was maintained at 500 °C. The declustering
potentials (DP) and collision energies (CE) were optimized for
each analyte (Table S1). Peak area was recorded for each
analyte, and data analysis was performed using Analyst and
Multiquant software (Applied Biosystems). Two-tailed Student’s t test was performed to compare relative amount of
metabolites between the ischemic hemisphere and contralateral
hemisphere. P-values ≤0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.
MALDI Analysis. Evaluation of New Matrix Candidate.
For MALDI analysis, the dried-droplet sample preparation
method was used as follows: 1 μL of sample solution was mixed
with 1 μL of matrix solution, and 1 μL of the mixture was then
pipetted on the stainless steel target probe, following by drying
under a stream of nitrogen gas at room temperature.
Mass Spectrometry Imaging. For MSI, the matrix solution,
1,5-DAN in 50% ethanol/water prepared as described above,
was sprayed onto the tissue sections mounted onto ITO coated
glass slides using an automatic matrix sprayer (ImagePrep,
Bruker Daltonics) and made sure to have homogeneous matrix
coverage over the entire tissue surface.
An Ultraﬂextreme MALDI-TOF/TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with a smartbeam Nd: YAG
355 nm laser was utilized for MALDI analysis. The laser is ﬁred
at a repetition rate of 2000 Hz, and the analyzer was operated
in negative reﬂectron mode. The negative-ion mass spectra in
the reﬂector mode were collected with a pulsed ion extraction
time of 80 ns, an accelerating voltage of 20.00 kV, an extraction
voltage of 17.90 kV, a lens voltage of 5.85 kV, and a reﬂector
voltage of 21.15 kV. The laser spot size was set at medium focus
(∼50 μm laser spot diameter), and laser power was optimized
at the start of each run and then ﬁxed for the whole experiment.
The mass spectra data were acquired over a mass range of m/z
0−1000 Da. Mass calibration was performed with external
standards prior to data acquisition. For MSI analysis, imaging
spatial resolution was set to 200 μm for tissues from mice, 50
and 100 μm for brain tissues from rats. Each spectrum consists
of 200 laser shots. Regions of interest were manually deﬁned in
the imaging software using both the optical image and MSI data

image. MALDI mass spectra were processed with the total ion
current (TIC) normalization, and the signal intensity of each
imaging data was represented as the normalized intensity.
Further Detailed Structural Conﬁrmation. MS/MS
fragmentations using the LIFT technique on the Ultraﬂextreme
MALDI-TOF/TOF MS together with Fourier transform ion
cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS as well as Obitrap MS were
used for further conﬁrmation of the identiﬁed metabolites.
Detailed information is described in the Supporting Information. Metabolites were identiﬁed or predicted by comparing MS
or MS/MS spectra with those of standard compounds or
referring to databases (METLIN, http://metlin.scripps.edu/;
MassBank, http://www.massbank.jp/; Human Metabolome
Database, http://www.hmdb.ca/; and LIPID MAPS, http://
www.lipidmaps.org/).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Evaluation of the New Matrix Candidate. Figure S1-g
and Figure S2 presented the MALDI mass spectra of 1,5-DAN
hydrochloride acquired in negative and positive ion modes,
respectively. The positive ion spectrum showed only a single
peak at m/z 158.09 which corresponded to the 1,5-DAN radical
cation. The negative ion spectrum exhibited prominent peaks
arising from [Cl]− and [HCl2]− at m/z 34.8 and 70.8,
accompanied by weak chloride-adducted clusters of Fe(2+)
([FeCl3]− and [FeCl4]− at m/z 162.8 and 199.8).
Compared with the mass spectra of 1,5-DAN (Figure S1-e),
1,5-DAN hydrochloride exhibited much simpler mass spectrum
and few matrix derived background signals especially at the m/z
range of <500. The promising feature allows the novel matrix
candidate to be well-suited for MS analysis of small moleculars
in negative mode.
The mass spectrum for MALDI analysis of mixture standard
solutions containing important endogenous metabolites using
9-AA, DMAN, 1,5-DAN, and 1,5-DAN hydrochloride as matrix
was summarized in Figure S1. Figure 3S showed the mass
spectrum for analysis of a small molecule peptide mixture, and a
saccharide mixture used 1,5-DAN hydrochloride as matrix. The
results demonstrated that the newly prepared matrix not only
could detect a broad range of easily ionized analytes at higher
sensitivity compared with the literature reported promising
matrices but also has a good performance in desorption/
ionization of neutral molecules such as saccharides which were
very hard to be ionized using routine ion sources and
traditional matrices. With 1,5-DAN hydrochloride as matrix,
saccharides can form ion adducts with Cl− and be easily
desorbed/ionized.
As analytes in real samples always coexist with a highconcentration salt which may seriously suppress signals of the
analytes and lead to lower ionization eﬃciency, the salt
tolerance capacity of a matrix is of great signiﬁcance for MALDI
analysis. To evaluate the salt tolerance ability of 1,5-DAN
hydrochloride, NaCl solution with varied concentration as well
as PBS was used as the solvent of several typical endogenous
metabolites to simulate the real sample environment.
Furthermore, real samples such as ACSF, plasma, and tissue
homogenate were also used to evaluate the performance of the
newly prepared matrix for analysis of small molecules in a
complex environment.
As shown in Figure S4, all the analytes (1 mM) in the
presence of 126 mM NaCl or PBS could be detected with the
signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of higher than 200. The peak
intensity of the analytes declined with further concentrated salt

patterns of the rat brain tissues were illustrated in Figure S14.
The cerebral infarction region was unstained or faintly red after
24 h of MCAO. By comparing the MS or MS/MS spectra of
the metabolites from the brain tissue section with those of the
standard sample or referring to online databases, 19 metabolites
involved in ATP metabolism, TCA cycle, glutamate-glutamine
cycle, malate-aspartate shuttle, and lipid metabolism as well as
antioxidants and metal ions underwent relatively remarkable
changes in the ischemic hemisphere compared with the
contralateral hemisphere (Figures 2−4, Figure S13). Mass
spectra and an accurate mass of these metabolites are
summarized in Table S3, Table S4, Figure S8, and Figure S9.
MS/MS spectra data of some substances and the assignment of
the fragment ions are summarized in Figures S11−S12.
Interruption of ATP Metabolism. Oxidative phosphorylation
in the mitochondria is the major pathway of ATP generation.
ATP may be catabolized to be ADP, AMP, adenosine, inosine,
hypoxanthine, xanthine, and eventually to uric acid following
two catabolic routes.38 Creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine
(PCr) systems in the brain are essential for the buﬀering and
transport of high-energy phosphates. After the onset of
ischemia, restricted oxygen delivery limits mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation, thus leading to interrupted release
and consequently metabolic disturbances of ATP. Energy
related metabolites may be useful markers for the ongoing
energy crisis during focal ischemia. Previous studies reported
level alterations of ATP, adenosine, hypoxanthine, inosine, and
PCr following MCAO.39−41
The spatial distribution and changes of eight metabolites
involved in ATP metabolism in brain sections of rats subjected
to MCAO for 24 h visualized by MSI are presented in Figure 2.
Relatively remarkable decrease in ATP, ADP, and AMP levels
and consequently decreased concentration of other related
substances including adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, and
creatine in the ischemic area were observed. However, the
xanthine content in the infract region relatively increased
(Figure 2). The results were in agreement with the results by
MRM MS analysis (Figure 5), suggesting interruption of ATP
catabolism and reduced conversion between PCr and Cr. The
MSI map of these metabolites demonstrated that the
concentration and distribution of energy-related metabolites
in a large part of the ischemic hemisphere especially in the
cerebral cortex and corpus striatum regions are aﬀected by
ischemia, with all the metabolites except xanthine showing
similar alterations.

solution, but all analytes could be unambiguously detected with
the S/N ratio of higher than 70 even in saturated NaCl
solution. The mass spectrum for MALDI analysis of ACSF and
plasma shown in Figure S5 and Figure S6 demonstrated that
1,5-DAN hydrochloride could detect important metabolites in
complex biological samples with high sensitivity.
The mass spectrum for analysis of brain homogenate using
DMAN, 9-AA, 1,5-DAN, and 1,5-DAN hydrochloride as matrix
were presented in Figure 1. Compared with 9-AA and DMAN,
more signals in a small molecule range appeared in the
spectrum using 1,5-DAN hydrochloride as matrix. Although
1,5-DAN performed well in detection of lipids, its hydrochlorated version possessed a stronger salt-tolerance ability with
abundant signals at higher sensitivity. Furthermore, 1,5-DAN
hydrochloride could detect much more small molecules at the
m/z range of <500 with higher sensitivity compared with its
precursor. The mass spectrum for analysis of liver and kidneys
homogenate (Figure S7) further conﬁrmed a good performance
of 1,5-DAN hydrochloride for analysis of small molecules in a
complex environment.
All these results demonstrated that 1,5-DAN hydrochloride
preserved a unique feature of high salt tolerance, which
highlights its potential application for analysis of small
molecules in complex biological samples.
In Situ MSI of Normal Mouse Tissue Sections. In order
to evaluate the capacity of the 1,5-DAN hydrochloride for in
situ imaging of small molecules, MALDI-MSI livers, brain, and
kidneys tissue sections from normal mice were carried out.
Using 1,5-DAN hydrochloride as the matrix, we were able to
simultaneously visualize unique distributions in diﬀerent tissues
of more than 30 endogenous metabolites including amino
acids, nucleotide derivatives, and lipids as well as metal ions,
peptide, and redox-related metabolites in a single run.
Structures of these metabolites were successfully identiﬁed by
comparison of MS or MS/MS spectra with those of standard
compounds or referring to online databases. Mass spectra and
accurate mass by obitrap and MALDI FTICR are summarized
in Table S3, Table S4, Figure S8, and Figure S9. MSI maps,
MS/MS spectra, and assignment of fragment ions of
representative metabolites are presented in Figures S10−S12.
MSI of Rat Brain Following MCAO. To further explore
the potential utility of the 1,5-DAN hydrochloride based
MALDI-MSI in pathological metabolomics, a rat model of
MCAO was established, and metabolic alterations during the
ischemic period were investigated. Typical TTC staining

Eﬀects on TCA Cycle. Citric acid, an important intermediate
in the TCA cycle, was observed to be mainly accumulated in
the cerebral cortex and corpus striatum of the ischemic
hemisphere after MCAO for 24 h (Figure 3). Data obtained
from MRM MS analysis (Figure 5) also showed relatively
higher levels of citric acid in the extracts of the ischemic
hemisphere, which was in accordance with the results by MSI.
Eﬀects on Glutamate-Glutamine Cycle and MalateAsparate Shuttle. Glutamate is the most important and
abundant excitatory transmitter. After glutamate or GABA is
released, they are taken up and synthesized into glutamine.
Neurons take up glutamine and convert it to glutamate or
GABA, thereby completing the glutamate-glutamine cycle. LAsparate is another excitatory neurotransmitter and plays a key
role in malate-aspartate shuttle which provides an important
link between glycosis and TCA cycle and between TCA cycle
and neurotransmitter synthesis. Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity plays an important part in the pathogenesis of cerebral
ischemia.42 Relatively reduced glutamate, glutamine, and Laspartate levels in the infract site 24 h after MCAO was
observed (Figure 3), which was in agreement with the results as
the literature reported.1,39,43 Analysis by MRM MS further
showed relatively decreased levels of these substances in the
infract site (Figure 5), demonstrating the mismatch between
synthesis and consumption and of release and uptake during
MCAO, illustrating depression of glutamate-glutamine cycle,
malate-asparate shuttle, and serious metabolic interruption. NAcetylaspartate (NAA), an indicator for mitochondrial and
neuronal function, showed relatively decreased levels in the
ischemic lesion 24 h postischemia (Figure 3), which was in
accordance with results by MRM MS (Figure 5) and the
literature.4 The relative amount of these metabolites decreased
obviously in the ischemic hemisphere especially in the cerebral
cortex and corpus striatum regions compared with the
corresponding area of the contralateral hemisphere.
Disturbances of Ion Homeostasis. Na+ and K+ together
constituting >95% of the brain inorganic ions are responsible
for maintaining membrane potentials necessary for neuronal
activity. Na+, K+-ATPase and Na+-K+-2Cl−-cotransporter
(NKCC) are two important transporters and channels that
are involved in Na+ transport and eﬄux of K+.44,45 ATP is a
fundamental energy source for sustaining the function of Na+,
K+-ATPase. Dysfunctional mitochondria in focal ischemia led
to depletion of ATP and eventually suppression of Na+/K+ATPase.46 Furthermore, as it is embedded in the cell membrane
and requires phospholipids for maintenance of its activity, Na+/
K+-ATPase is very susceptible to free radical reaction and lipid
peroxidation.47,48 After occlusion of the cerebral artery,
dysfunctional Na+/K+-ATPase caused interruption of ion inﬂux
and eﬄux, eventually leading to brain edema and neuronal
necrosis.49,50 NKCC also played a prominent role in mediating
evolution of stroke-associated brain edema.51,52 Previous
literature reported increased concentration of Na+ and
decreased K + levels at the infarct site of rat brain
postischemia.8,53 MSI maps of Na+ and K+ were obtained as
shown in Figure 4. Compared with the corresponding area in
the contralateral hemisphere, Na+ accumulated, whereas the
content of K+ relatively decreased in the ischemic hemisphere
especially in the cerebral cortex and corpus striatum regions,
indicating disturbances of ion homeostasis occurring under
ischemic conditions.
Eﬀects on Antioxidants. During the ischemic period,
continuous accumulation of ROS exacerbated brain injury

metal ions, and phospholipids in the brain from control group and

through lipid peroxidation and membrane damage and
eventually resulted in necrosis and apoptosis. Low molecular
weight antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH), ascorbic acid
(AA), and taurine are one of the important endogenous
mechanisms against ROS. MSI maps of AA, GSH, and taurine
were obtained as shown in Figure 4a. Compared with the
corresponding area in the contralateral hemisphere, abundance
of the three antioxidants showed a relative decline in the
ischemic hemisphere especially in the cerebral cortex and
corpus striatum regions, which were in accordance with the
literature reported.1,54,55 Furthermore, more obvious alterations
occurred for AA and GSH, which were in agreement with the
data obtained using MRM MS (Table S2, Figure 5). It can be
concluded that the overproduction of ROS exhausted the
endogenous antioxidant defense system of neuronal cell,
resulting in decreased content of antioxidants in the infract
area.

the second highest concentration of phospholipids (20−25%)
after adipose tissue,56 lipid metabolism is of particular
importance for the central nervous system. After onset of
ischemia, neuronal receptors stimulated by glutamate resulted
in activating various phospholipases and release of second
messengers,42 consequently leading to signiﬁcant alterations of
phospholipids.19,25−27,57 Comparing imaging data between
contralateral and ischemic hemisphere, one phospholipid at
m/z 480 was found to be accumulated mainly in the cortex and
corpus striatum regions of the ischemic-damaged hemisphere
(Figure 4c). With further structural conﬁrmation, it was
assigned to be phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (PE (18:0).
The identiﬁed phospholipids in the present study can be used
as phospholipid biomarkers of ischemic injury.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, 1,5-DAN hydrochloride was prepared, and it was
successfully applied for analysis of small molecules. 1,5-DAN
hydrochloride assisted LDI MSI of small molecules in kidneys,
liver, and brain tissues permitted us to simultaneously visualize
unique distributions of metabolites in the diﬀerent tissues and
in diﬀerent regions of the same tissue. Besides, 1,5-DAN
hydrochloride assisted LDI MSI of brain sections of rats
subjected to MCAO for 24 h clearly shows profound alterations
of intermediates in ATP metabolism, TCA cycle, glutamateglutamine cycle, and malate-aspartate shuttle, together with
metal ions as well as antioxidants and phospholipids in the
ischemic hemisphere. Except for a relatively increased
concentration of xanthine, citric acid, sodium, and PE (18:0)
in the ischemic regions, relative level decreases for potassium,
glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, NAA, ATP, ADP, AMP,
adenosine, inosine, hypoxanthine, creatine, taurine, GSH, and
AA were also observed. The results were in good agreement
with data obtained by MRM MS. The newly prepared organic
salt matrix possesses unique features such as high salt tolerance
capacity and fewer background signals, which promises its
potentially eﬀective and widespread application in small
molecule in situ MSI and in the ﬁeld of biomedical research.
