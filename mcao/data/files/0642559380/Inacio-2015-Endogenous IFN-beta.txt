Abstract
Background: Interferon (IFN)-β exerts anti-inflammatory effects, coupled to remarkable neurological improvements in
multiple sclerosis, a neuroinflammatory condition of the central nervous system. Analogously, it has been hypothesized
that IFN-β, by limiting inflammation, decreases neuronal death and promotes functional recovery after stroke. However,
the core actions of endogenous IFN-β signaling in stroke are unclear.
Methods: To address this question, we used two clinically relevant models of focal cerebral ischemia, transient and
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, and two genetically modified mouse lines, lacking either IFN-β or its
receptor, the IFN-α/β receptor. Subsets of inflammatory and immune cells isolated from the brain, blood, and spleen
were studied using flow cytometry. Sensorimotor deficits were assessed by a modified composite neuroscore,
the rotating pole and grip strength tests, and cerebral infarct volumes were given by lack of neuronal nuclei
immunoreactivity.
Results: Here, we report alterations in local and systemic inflammation in IFN-β knockout (IFN-βKO) mice over 8 days
after induction of focal cerebral ischemia. Notably, IFN-βKO mice showed a higher number of infiltrating leukocytes in
the brain 2 days after stroke. Concomitantly, in the blood of IFN-βKO mice, we found a higher percentage of total B
cells but a similar percentage of mature and activated B cells, collectively indicating a higher proliferation rate. The
additional differential regulation of circulating cytokines and splenic immune cell populations in wild-type and IFN-βKO
mice further supports an important immunoregulatory function of IFN-β in stroke. Moreover, we observed a significant
weight loss 2–3 days and a reduction in grip strength 2 days after stroke in the IFN-βKO group, while endogenous
IFN-β signaling did not affect the infarct volume.
Conclusions: We conclude that endogenous IFN-β signaling attenuates local inflammation, regulates peripheral
immune cells, and, thereby, may contribute positively to stroke outcome.

Background
Stroke elicits a strong inflammatory response that critically contributes not only to tissue demise but also to
repair and regeneration and also is thought to underlie
the number one secondary complication found in stroke
patients: infection [1]. Specifically, the inflammatory response after stroke comprises changes in the expression
of inflammatory mediators and immunocompetent cell
populations not only locally, in the brain, but also at the
blood-brain interface and in peripheral systems, including the spleen. For example, upregulations of interleukin
(IL)-1β and CXCL-1 in the brain have been consistently
found in experimental models of stroke [2, 3]. Leukocytes infiltrate the brain parenchyma within hours and
days after stroke onset, through a compromised bloodbrain barrier (BBB) or via active recruitment [2, 4–6].
Pro-inflammatory cascades are rapidly activated following stroke and are paralleled or followed by an
immunosuppressant signaling. Within the first days
after stroke, while a decrease in pro-inflammatory
pathways may occur in the brain [7, 8], immunosuppression is more evident in the periphery. Apoptotic
loss of natural killer (NK), B and T lymphocytes in
the blood and spleen, a decreased capacity of interferon (IFN)-γ production by blood-derived leukocytes
along with atrophy of the spleen and thymus have
been described both in stroke patients and/or rodents
subjected to stroke and implicated in an increased susceptibility to infection [7–12]. In agreement with the view
that limiting post-stroke inflammation will decrease neuronal death or promote neurological recovery, IFN-β has
been put forward as a candidate drug for the treatment of
stroke (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and
Stroke-sponsored phase I clinical trial).
IFN-β is a type I IFN that binds to the IFN-α/β receptor
(IFNAR). Systemic administration of recombinant (r)IFN-β
is currently used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis
(MS), although the exact mechanisms by which IFN-β administration is beneficial in MS are not fully understood
[13]. IFN-β may promote a shift from a T helper (Th)1 to
Th2 response by blood-derived cells and reduce the proliferation of T lymphocytes. It also may diminish the entry
of inflammatory and immune cells into the central nervous system (CNS) by downregulating adhesion molecules
and matrix metalloproteinase expression by leukocytes, as
well as by stabilizing endothelial tight junctions at the
BBB [13]. In a mouse model of MS, endogenous IFN-β
signaling was sufficient to promote a better disease
outcome, which was associated with a decrease in CNS
inflammation but not with changes in autoreactive T cells
[14, 15]. In support, exogenous IFN-β also reduced
autoreactive T cell proliferation by inhibiting the antigenpresenting capacity of microglia and astrocytes, the CNSspecific antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [16, 17].

Studies addressing the effects of IFN-β administration
in stroke are scarce and divergent. Systemic administration of human rIFN-β before and up to 4 h after induction of stroke in rabbits resulted in neuroprotection [18].
Similarly, rats showed smaller infarct volumes when
treated with rat rIFN-β even up to 6 h after stroke [19].
In mice, intracerebroventricular administration of mouse
rIFN-β immediately before or after stroke resulted in a
decrease in infarct volume at 24 h [20]. However,
systemic administration of wild-type (WT) IFN-β or
pegylated IFN-β for 3 or 7 days after transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo) had no effect on behavioral performance or infarct volume, but aggravated
weight loss in rats [21]. In a recent study, IFN-β administration following experimentally induced subarachnoid
hemorrhage, in rats, also provided no effect on outcome
measures [22].
We investigated the action of endogenous IFN-β signaling on inflammation and on the development of sensorimotor deficits and infarct volume. For that purpose,
we used IFN-β and IFNAR knockout mice (IFN-βKO
and IFNAR-KO, respectively) and two clinically relevant
models of ischemic stroke, tMCAo and permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo). We focused
our study on the first 8 days after stroke onset, a time
period critical for recovery of neurological function and
infarct core formation [23].

Methods
Ethical considerations

We conducted animal experiments in accordance with protocols approved by the Malmö/Lund Ethical Committee
for Animal Research (M332-09, M243-07) and Danish
Animal Health Care Committee (2011/561-1950), as well
as to the ARRIVE guidelines. Experiments were carried
out in a blinded and randomized fashion.
Mouse strains and housing conditions

We used 10 to 40-week-old IFN-βKO [24], as well as
8 to 10-week-old IFNAR-KO [14] male mice backcrossed
to C57BL/6 for over 20 generations; WT controls (C57BL/
6, age- and gender-matched) were purchased from Taconic
(Ry, Denmark). Mice were housed in climate-controlled
rooms under diurnal conditions, with ad libitum access to
water and food.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion

We modeled stroke in mice by tMCAo as described previously [3]. Mice were placed in an incubator at 35 °C
during the first 2 h post-surgery and in an incubator at
33 °C overnight. We injected 0.3 mL of 5 % glucose in
saline (sterile) subcutaneously, 30 min, 24 h, and thereafter every 12 h up to 4 days after surgery; weight loss
ceases typically between days 3 and 4 after tMCAo. We

Inácio et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:211

measured body temperature 1 h, 2 h, and daily up to
7 days after surgery. In addition, we assessed body
weight before and after surgery on a daily basis.
Inclusion criteria

An immediate reduction in regional cerebral blood flow
and metabolism (rCBF) upon occlusion of the MCA and
reperfusion were set as the primary inclusion criteria (2
of 78 mice were excluded). Moreover, mice that exhibited signs of pain, weakness, and/or distress were euthanatized and included in the mortality rates (one of 76
mice). One IFNAR-KO and one WT control were excluded
from the infarct volume analysis due to bad quality of the
tissue. Characteristic ipsilateral subcortical and cortical infarcts were verified in all mice [3].

scores 3 and 4, but fell from the pole, respectively. We
video recorded the sessions for a final analysis. All mice
were able to cross the pole prior to surgery (scores 5–6).
Sham-operated animals scored 5 or 6 at all the modalities,
and we did not observe differences between genotypes.
Grip strength test

In experiments involving IFN-βKO mice, we used the
grip strength test (Bioseb, Vitrolles, France) as reported
previously [3]. We present the maximum grip strength
value of five trials as percentage of baseline (collected
the day before surgery). The grip strength of IFNAR-KO
mice and WT counterparts was evaluated as reported
previously [28], and we present the maximum grip
strength value of five trials (for each paw).

Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion

Carbon black perfusion

We modeled stroke in mice by pMCAo as reported before [5]. After surgery, mice were allowed to recover
from anesthesia in a 28 °C controlled environment and
given a subcutaneous injection of 0.05 mg/Kg (body
weight) buprenorphine in saline (Temgesic, ScheringPlough, Ballerup, Denmark) three times, every 8 h, starting immediately after surgery.

The cerebral vasculature was visualized using a protocol
described previously [3].

Inclusion criteria

All mice exhibiting a neocortical infarct, assessed using
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, were
included (one mouse of a total of 20 mice was excluded).
Behavioral tests
Composite neuroscore

We evaluated gross sensorimotor deficits 24 h after
tMCAo by behavioral tests adapted from [25–27]. Mice
were scored with respect to (1) spontaneous rotation
(from 0, rotation on the body axis, to 5, no rotation), (2)
resistance to lateral force applied to the left, (3) left forelimb flexion on suspension by the tail, (4) left hindlimb
flexion when only the hind limbs are lifted from the
surface, and (5) forelimb impairment (from 0, paralysis,
to 5, normal). For tests 2 to 4, a scoring system of 0 (no
resistance or flexion) to 4 (normal) was used; resistance
to lateral force applied to the right and right limb flexion
also were evaluated. Sham-operated animals scored 32.
Rotating pole test

The rotating pole test was performed essentially as
described before [3], with a few modifications. Mice
were trained to cross the pole at 0, 3, and 10 rotations
per minute (rpm), to the left and right, 2 days and 1 day
prior to surgery (tMCAo and sham). With respect to the
number of foot slips, only the contralateral forelimb was
taken into consideration. Scores 2 and 3 were attributed
additionally to animals that clearly met the criteria of

Isolation of immune and inflammatory cells

Mice were anesthetized using 1.8–2.5 % isoflurane
(IsobaVet, Schering-Plough Animal Health, Milton Keynes,
UK) in O2:N2O (30:70). From each mouse, 400 μL of
blood was extracted by intracardiac puncture, using
heparinized syringes. Blood was gently homogenized and
maintained at 4 °C. Thereafter, mice were perfused transcardially with 10 mL of saline (5 mL/min). Brains were
quickly dissected, freed from meninges, and kept in
Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, Paisley,
UK) supplemented with 0.2 % bovine serum albumin
(BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany) and 0.01 %
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, Invitrogen) at
4 °C. Spleens were weighed and transferred to 2 % fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) at 4 °C. Blood plasma
was obtained following standard centrifugation (1300×g
for 10 min, 4 °C) of blood; plasma was stored at −80 °C.
Brain

Ispilateral or contralateral hemispheres of three to four
mice of the same genotype (IFN-βKO or WT) were
pooled together. Tissue was mechanically dissociated in
HBSS supplemented with 0.2 % BSA and 0.01 % EDTA
using a Dounce homogenizer and passed through a 40-μm
nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences, Stockholm, Sweden).
The cell suspension was centrifuged at 400×g for 10 min
at room temperature. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 30 % Percoll (GE Healthcare, Sweden) in HBSS
and gently overlaid on a 37–70 % Percoll gradient.
Following centrifugation at 500×g for 20 min at room
temperature, cells were collected at the 37–70 % interface
and rinsed with 10 % FBS in HBSS. After a last centrifugation at 400×g for 10 min at room temperature, the cell

Inácio et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:211

pellet was resuspended in 2 % FBS in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, Invitrogen).
Blood and spleen

We added red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (eBioscience,
San Diego, CA, USA) to 200 μL of blood. We dissociated whole spleens in RBC lysis buffer, using a 40 μm
nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences). We stopped RBC
lysis by adding 2 % FBS in PBS. After centrifugation
(300×g for 5 min at 4 °C), cells were resuspended in 2 %
FBS in PBS. Splenocytes were stained with trypan blue
and total numbers estimated using a Bürker chamber.
Flow cytometry

Isolated immune and inflammatory cells were incubated
with primary antibodies for 20 min at 4 °C. After rising
with 2 % FBS in PBS, cells were incubated with the
secondary antibody Streptavidin PErCP (1:200, BD
Biosciences) for 20 min at 4 °C (only for detection of
CD122). Subsequent to rinsing, cells were exposed to
Cytofix for 20 min at 4 °C and rinsed with BD Perm/
Wash buffer (both reagents were purchased from BD
Biosciences). Finally, we resuspended the cells using 2 %
FBS in PBS. Flow cytometry was carried out using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), with analysis being performed using CellQuest (BD Biosciences) for
acquisition after exclusion of duplets and FlowJo 8.8.6 (Tree
Star, Ashland, OR, USA). For each sample, we analyzed a
total of 100,000 events (cells). We present the results as percentage of total cells analyzed, unless otherwise indicated.
We used the following primary antibodies (purchased
from BD Biosciences, unless otherwise indicated), each
at a dilution of 1:200: B220-FITC, MCHII-PE, CD4APC, CD25-FITC, CD8-PE, CD122-biotin, CD11b-APC,
CD45.2-FITC (BioLegend, USA), and NK1.1-PE.

Free-floating, 30-μm-thick coronal brain slices were
rinsed three times with PBS and kept in a 5 % blocking
solution (5 % normal serum, Jackson ImmunoResearch,
Suffolk, UK, and 0.25 % Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h, at
room temperature. Following blocking, we incubated
slices with primary antibody(ies) in 2 % blocking
solution overnight at 4 °C. After rinsing, slices were
incubated with secondary antibody(ies) in 2 % blocking
solution for 2 h at room temperature.
Primary antibodies and respective dilutions used in this
study are as follows: rabbit anti-claudin-5 (1:100, Bioworld
Technology); rat anti-CD45 (1:500, MCA1031G, AbD
Serotec, Europe); rat anti-galectin-3, Gal-3 (biotinylated,
1:500; Acris Antibodies, Herford, Germany); rat anti-Gal-3
(1:1000; kindly provided by Professor Hakon Leffler, Lund
University, Sweden); rabbit anti-ionized calcium-binding
adapter molecule 1, Iba-1 (1:1000; Wako, Osaka, Japan);
and mouse anti-neuronal nuclei, NeuN (1:800; SigmaAldrich). The two antibodies targeting Gal-3 yielded
equivalent results. Primary antibodies were detected using
streptavidin-Alexa488 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen);
anti-rat Cy3; anti-rabbit Cy3; and anti-mouse biotinylated
or anti-mouse Cy2; all reagents were diluted 1:400
(antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch). The biotinylated secondary antibody was detected by avidin-HRP (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough,
UK). With respect to BBB integrity assays, to detect
mouse IgG in the brain parenchyma, we used a specific
HRP-conjugated reagent by cell signaling (catalog number
8125), following the instructions provided by the
manufacturer. HRP was, in all cases, detected through
3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) precipitates. In some cases,
nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich).
Assessment of CD45+ cells, in situ

Quantification of Th1/Th2 cytokines protein levels in the
blood plasma

We determined the protein concentrations of IFN-γ,
IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-α, and mouse keratinocyte-derived factor
(mK or GRO/CXCL-1) in blood plasma by a sandwich
immunoassay (Mouse Th1/Th2 9-Plex Ultra-Sensitive Kit,
Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). We
performed the assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Ultra-Sensitive Kit). We used 35 μL of
undiluted plasma per well (96-well plates). Plates were read
using a SECTOR Imager 6000 (Meso Scale Discovery).
Immunohistochemistry

For a subset of mice, perfusion with saline was followed
by perfusion with 45 mL of 4 % formaldehyde in PBS
(5 mL/min). Brains were kept in formaldehyde overnight
and thereafter in 40 % sucrose in PBS, always at 4 °C.

To estimate the number of CD45+ cells in the brain, in
situ, we performed CD45 immunolabeling, as described
above. From each brain, we used four slices with the following stereotaxic coordinates: approximately 0.86, 0.26,
−0.34, and −1.34 mm (anterior-posterior, AP) in relation
to the bregma. We counted CD45+ cells populating one
cortical and/or one striatal infarct core region, each corresponding to a field of vision of about 1 mm2 per section.
Regions were sampled equivalently across mice. Cells were
counted under a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse
80i, Nikon, Solna, Sweden) by an experimenter blinded to
the genotype. In addition, CD45+ cells were imaged using
Nikon A1 Confocal on a Ti-E microscope and data processed using the NIS-Elements software (Nikon).
Iba-1 and Gal-3 immunoassays

Additionally, we performed Iba-1 and Gal-3 (double)
immunolabeling. Here, we used, from each brain, slices

Inácio et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:211

corresponding to the following coordinates: approximately
1.10 mm (level 1), 0.50 mm (level 2), and −1.34 mm (level
3) AP in relation to the bregma. Fluorescent dyes were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted confocal microscope.
For each brain slice, three (within level 1) or four (within
levels 2 and 3) Z-stack images with the dimensions of
640 μm × 640 μm × ~40 μm were collected for analysis;
one Z-stack image was acquired from the peri-infarct region (negative control for Gal-3) and the remaining from
the infarct core.
The density of Iba-1+ and Gal3+ macrophages/microglia
within the infarct core 8 days after tMCAo is relatively
high, and cellular processes may overlap. Under these
conditions, counting cells is suboptimal, particularly when
using epifluorescence microscopy. We therefore quantified the fraction of Iba-1+ signal colocalizing with Gal-3
and vice versa by calculating Mander’s coefficients of the
acquired Z-stack images (for simplification, referred to as
the percentage of Iba-1+ cells expressing Gal-3 and vice
versa), using ImageJ software (National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), [29]. Signal intensity thresholds were set manually after applying a denoise filter. Our
approach minimized false positives by treating each
optical slice of each Z-stack independently, instead of
analyzing collapsed Z-stack images. Analysis of Gal-3+ cell
morphology was carried out using Image J. For each brain,
we selected 30–40 Gal-3+ cells within the infarct core and
manually plotted their outline. For each cell, area, perimeter, circularity, Feret’s diameter, and aspect ratio values
were calculated. Analysis was carried out on projected
Z-stacks, and only non-overlapping cells were included
(as determined on non-projected Z-stacks in both XY and
Z dimensions).
Gal-3 immunoreactivity

We used three additional brain slices per animal (approximately 0.98, 0.38, and −1.06 mm in relation to bregma) for
Gal-3 (single) immunolabeling; Gal-3+ signal was estimated
following a procedure previously described in detail [3].
Assessment of blood-brain barrier integrity through IgG
and claudin-5 immunoassays

When investigating the presence of IgG in the parenchyma
of WT and IFN-βKO brains, we used brain slices centered
at 0 mm AP in relation to the bregma (equivalent slices
were used across animals). The IgG-specific signal within
the infarct core and peri-infarct region was, for each
section, qualitatively and qualitatively assessed. Adjacent
brain slices were used for analysis of claudin-5 immunoreactivity, as described before [30]. Briefly, only claudin-5+
vessels showing a relatively strong and continuous
(claudin-5) signal were analyzed. The area occupied by
and average length of claudin-5+ vessels in a selected region of the peri-infarct cortex (1 mm2) were quantified, for

Page 5 of 18

each section, using the Image J software. All images were
acquired using a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope and the
NIS-Elements software.
Infarct volume
IFN-βKO

For each animal, a series of 30-μm-thick coronal brain
slices of the entire brain (240 μm between consecutive
slices) was used for NeuN immunolabeling; we used
equivalent series among animals. Micrographs were acquired with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope, using the
NIS-Elements software, under standardized conditions.
For each slice, the areas corresponding to the contralateral
hemisphere (Contra) and to NeuN+ tissue within the ipsilateral hemisphere (IpsiNeuN) were encircled using ImageJ.
The infarct area (IA) was estimated accounting for edema
or tissue shrinkage: IA = Contra − IpsiNeuN. Infarct volume
was obtained by volumetric integration.
IFNAR-KO

Mice subjected to tMCAO were given an overdose of
pentobarbital and fixative-perfused. A series of 30-μmthick coronal brain slices (180 μm between consecutive
slices) was stained with toluidine blue, and infarct volumes
were estimated as described in [5]. For mice subjected to
pMCAO, brains were sliced into 1-mm-thick coronal
slices; slices were stained with TTC as described before
[3]. Infarct volumes were estimated as described above for
IFN-βKO mice and WT counterparts.
Statistics

We present the data as mean ± SD, unless otherwise
indicated. To compare two groups, we used Student’s t
test (two-tailed), and comparison of three or more
groups was done by two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), with the following exceptions. For the composite neuroscore and rotating pole scores, we used the
Mann-Whitney U test. Mortality rates were assessed
using Fisher’s exact test. For IFN-βKO and WT mice
undergoing tMCAo or sham surgery, differences in
temperature and weight loss post-surgery were analyzed
using a mixed model ANOVA, with multiple comparisons being performed for representative time points
(24 h, 2, 3, and 7 days). Analysis of the weight before
surgery was done using one-way ANOVA. For IFNARKO and WT mice subjected to tMCAo, temperature and
grip strength asymmetry post-surgery were evaluated
using repeated measures ANOVA. All multiple comparisons were performed post hoc using the Student’s t test,
with Bonferroni correction. Results were considered
significant when p < 0.05. Unless otherwise specified,
in the figures, we present only the results obtained
for pair-wise comparisons, with Bonferroni correction.

Results
IFN-βKO mice show a higher accumulation of leukocytes
in the brain 2 days after tMCAo

To investigate the effect of endogenous IFN-β expression on the inflammatory response, along with the development of sensorimotor deficits and infarct volume that
follow an ischemic stroke, we made use of a genetically
modified mouse line, lacking the IFN-β encoding gene.
These mice along with WT counterparts underwent
tMCAo or sham surgery (the experimental outline is included in Fig. 1a). Putative alterations in cerebral vasculature and rCBF owing to the genetic manipulation were
addressed in two ways. First, mice of both genotypes
(IFN-βKO and WT) were perfused with a gelatinous carbon black solution, brains were imaged under standard
conditions, and the configuration of the circle of Willis
and middle cerebral artery (MCA) was analyzed.
Abrogation of IFN-β in mice did not lead to detectable
changes in the configuration of the circle of Willis or
MCA (Additional file 1). Secondly, rCBF values at the
MCA occlusion and reperfusion times were similar
between genotypes, suggesting an unaltered rCBF in
response to ischemia (n = 21–24 for each group). Occlusion values (in percentage of baseline): 18.4 ± 5.7 %
(WT) and 21.2 ± 6.4 % (IFN-βKO). Reperfusion values
(in percentage of baseline): 91.2 ± 16.0 % (WT) and
82.8 ± 26.0 % (IFN-βKO).
Innate immune cells (notably granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and NK cells) are within the first
wave of immune cells recruited to the site of damage
and inflammation [31]. Whether, in stroke, this process
is critically regulated by endogenous IFN-β remains unclear. To address this question, we isolated immune and
inflammatory cells from the brains of IFN-βKO and WT
mice 2 days after tMCAo and quantified, using flow
cytometry, the percentages of CD45highCD11b+ cells,
(infiltrating) leukocytes, and CD45dimCD11b+ cells,
(brain-resident) microglia [2, 5, 32]. Our gating strategy
is demonstrated in Fig. 1b. Using this approach, we
found a higher percentage of CD11b+ leukocytes in the
ipsilateral hemispheres of IFN-βKO versus WT mice
(Fig. 1c). Note that, as expected, the percentage of
CD11b+ leukocytes is overall higher in ipsilateral than in
contralateral hemispheres (p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA).
By contrast, the percentage of CD11b+ microglia did not
differ among examined conditions (Fig. 1d). These
results indicate that, in mice lacking IFN-β, the strokeinduced accumulation of blood-originating cells is enhanced. Indeed, analysis of CD45+ cell numbers, in situ,
revealed an approximately 50 % increase within the proximal (i.e., striatal) infarct core in IFN-βKO mice (Fig. 1e).
CD11b+ leukocytes and microglia were analyzed further
for the expression of major histocompatibility complex II
(MHCII), a hallmark of APCs activation [16]. We found

Page 6 of 18

no significant difference in the percentage of MHCII+ cells
within the CD45high/dimCD11b+ populations between IFNβKO and WT mice (Fig. 1f, g), likely reflecting an equivalent leukocyte/microglial activation capacity (irrespective
of the total numbers of CD45high/dimCD11b+ cells). On the
other hand, a higher total number of CD45highCD11b+
leukocytes (as shown in Fig. 1c, d) and a similar percentage of MHCII+ cells within this cell population collectively
imply a higher total number of activated leukocytes in
IFN-βKO versus WT brains.
Innate immune cells include two different NK1.1expressing subsets: NK cells (CD3−NK1.1+) and NKT
(CD3+NK1.1+) cells [33]. Increases in innate cells subpopulations could result in a differential recruitment or
local regulation of T cells. However, we did not find
genotypic differences in NK, NKT, or T cell subsets
studied—CD3+CD4+ Th, CD4+CD25+ T regulatory (Treg),
CD3+CD8+ T cytotoxic (TC), and CD8+CD122+ Treg cells
(data not shown).
The development of the Gal-3 response over the first
week post-stroke is similar in IFN-βKO mice and WT
controls

To explore further the possible influence of IFN-β on the
development of the macrophages and microglial response
post-stroke, we analyzed cerebral Iba-1 and Gal-3 immunoreactivities in IFN-βKO and WT mice, 8 days after
tMCAo. While Iba-1 is generally found in macrophages
and microglia, there is evidence, at least up to 72 h after
stroke, that Gal-3 is preferentially expressed by activated
microglia [34, 35]. The Gal-3 macrophages/microglial
population is particularly interesting because it has been
suggested to play a beneficial role in stroke [3, 35–37].
Gal-3+ cells accumulate in the infarct core over the first
week after tMCAo and are responsive to the expression of
inflammatory clues [4].
Iba-1 immunoreactivity was particularly high at the
outer border of the infarct core and peri-infarct region
(Fig. 2a), and expectedly, Iba-1+ cells appeared ramified in
regions remote to the infarct core and amoeboid-like close
to or in the infarct core. Gal-3, on the other hand, was
found predominantly within the infarct core, and Gal-3+
cells exhibited an amoeboid morphology. Within the
infarct core of WT mice, about 87.4 ± 0.05 % of Iba-1
colocalized with Gal-3 (Fig. 2b) and 96.5 ± 0.07 % of Gal-3
colocalized with Iba-1 (Fig. 2c), findings that were similar
in IFN-βKO mice. Note that most Gal-3+ cells express
Iba-1, whereas Iba-1 itself clearly relates to a broader
population of cells. Area, perimeter, Feret’s diameter as
well as circularity of Gal-3+ cells did not differ significantly
between IFN-βKO versus WT mice, suggesting a similar
morphology (Fig. 2d–h). Gal-3 immunoreactivity did not
differ between groups (Fig. 2i), indicative of similar
expression levels/total number of cells.

Collectively, our data suggest an increased accumulation of leukocytes in the brain parenchyma of IFN-βKO
mice within the first days after tMCAo, which could
occur, at least in part, through a relatively increase in
BBB permeability. However, we found no evidence for
alterations in BBB integrity between WT and IFN-βKO
mice 2 days after tMCAo, as evaluated by in situ IgG
detection, reflecting vessel extravasation, or claudin-5
immunoreactivity, probing for tight junction function
(Additional file 2).

IFN-βKO mice show a higher number of circulating
immature B cells after tMCAo

To study the potential involvement of IFN-β in the regulation of peripheral immune cell subsets post-stroke, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 2 days
after tMCAo, as well as 8 days following tMCAo and sham
surgery, and we quantified different immune cell subsets
using flow cytometry (see Fig. 1a for the experimental outline). Whereas lack of IFN-β expression resulted in a higher
percentage of CD11b+ leukocytes in the brain following

Fig. 3 Mice lacking IFN-β show an increase in the fraction of circulating B220+ (immature) B cells 2 days after tMCAo. PBMCs were isolated 2 days
after tMCAo (WT, n = 9; IFN-βKO, n = 11), as well as 8 days after tMCAo (WT, n = 6–7; IFN-βKO, n = 7–8) and sham surgery (n = 4 for each genotype).

ANOVA, for NK cells) and 2 days post-occlusion (##p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA, for NK and NKT cells)

tMCAo (Fig. 1), the percentages of different innate immune
cell subsets within PBMCs were similar between genotypes,
for all of the evaluated conditions (Fig. 3a–e). Irrespective
of the genotype, stroke led to a decrease in the percentages
of NK (gated R1) and NKT (gated R2) cells, which was observed 8 days after tMCAo, in relation to both sham surgery (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA, for NK cells only) and
2 days post-occlusion (p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA, for
NK and NKT cells), (Fig. 3c–e).

Unlike the innate immune subsets tested, the B cell response post-stroke was strikingly affected by IFN-β expression. Specifically, in WT mice, the percentage of
B220+ B cells in the PBMC pool was lower 2 days after
tMCAo than after sham surgery, returning to sham
equivalent levels within 2 to 8 days after tMCAo (Fig. 3f ).
In IFN-βKO mice, the total percentage of B220+ B cells
within PBMCs 2 days after tMCAo was, although reduced when compared to sham surgery, significantly

Inácio et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:211

higher than that in respective WT controls, and it did
not differ from that observed 8 days after tMCAo. For
both genotypes, stroke induced a transient decrease in
B220+MHCII+ cells. However, while the percentage of
B220+ B cells was higher in the IFN-βKO group 2 days
after tMCAo, the percentage of mature and activated
B220+MHCII+ cells did not differ between genotypes in
any of the conditions tested (Fig. 3g). These results
suggest a higher rate of proliferation of B cells in IFNβKO mice compared to WT controls. With respect to
CD3+CD4+ Th, CD4+CD25+ Treg, CD3+CD8+ TC, and
CD8+CD122+ Tregcells, we did not find differences
among experimental conditions (Additional file 3).
IFN-βKO mice do not show a stroke-induced decrease in
the number of splenocytes

Stroke-induced immunosuppression encompasses spleen
atrophy, which occurs partially through apoptotic loss of
splenocytes [7, 8, 10, 11] and partially through mobilization of splenic inflammatory and immune cell pools
[38, 39]. For that reason, we studied the effect of IFN-β
signaling on spleen weight and number of splenocytes
8 days after tMCAo or sham surgery. Surprisingly, we

Page 10 of 18

found that the spleens of sham-operated IFN-βKO mice
weighed significantly less and were noticeably smaller than
those of sham-operated WT mice (Fig. 4a, b). This
phenomenon was verified further by normalizing spleen
weight to body weight (Fig. 4c, see also Additional file 4).
Interestingly, the tendency toward a lower spleen weight
after tMCAo observed in WT animals (Fig. 4a) was not
apparent after normalization (Fig. 4c). In line with the
previous results, the number of splenocytes was markedly
lower in sham-operated IFN-βKO versus WT mice
(Fig. 4d). Moreover, we obtained a significantly lower
number of splenocytes in WT mice post-occlusion versus
sham surgery, and this stroke-induced decrease in the
number of splenocytes did not occur in IFN-βKO mice. It
is important to note that both genotypes showed similar
numbers of splenocytes 8 days after tMCAo.
Endogenous IFN-β affects stroke-induced changes in
immune and inflammatory cell subsets in the spleen

Next, we assessed different immune and inflammatory
cell subsets within splenocytes, as described previously
for PBMCs. In contrast to WT controls, IFN-βKO mice
showed a significant increase in the percentage of

CD11b+ cells in the spleen 2 days after tMCAo versus
sham surgery (Fig. 5a). For both genotypes, the expression of MHCII+ CD11b+ leukocytes was lower 2 days
after tMCAo than that after sham surgery and, at 8 days
after tMCAo, did not differ from that observed in shamoperated animals (Fig. 5b). These results suggest a differential regulation of CD11b+/MHCII+ CD11b+ in mice
lacking IFN-β. Note also that these results contrast the
MHCII+ CD11b+ profile obtained for PBMCs (Fig. 4b)
and suggest a stroke-dependent modulation of MHCII
regulatory mechanisms in the spleen, despite spleen

atrophy. With respect to NK.1.1-expressing cell subpopulations, important stroke-dependent effects that were
evident in WT mice were not reproduced in the IFNβKO group (Fig. 5c, d). Indeed, in WT mice, the NK and
NKT cell fractions increased 2 days post-occlusion versus sham, normalizing 8 days after tMCAo. In IFN-βKO
mice, on the other hand, the percentage of NK cells did
not increase significantly 2 days post-occlusion compared to that in sham, and the percentage of NKT cells
was not significantly altered across conditions (sham, 2
and 8 days after tMCAo). These data point toward a

Inácio et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:211

Page 12 of 18

differential regulation of NK/NKT cells in mice lacking
IFN-β.
Contrasting with the increase found in PBMCs (Fig. 3),
the percentage of B220+ lymphocytes did not differ between mice lacking IFN-β and WT controls (Fig. 5f ).
Yet, for both genotypes, stroke induced a transient
decrease in B220+MHCII+ lymphocytes. Thus, despite
spleen atrophy, a stroke-induced increase in proliferating
B cells also could be verified. Finally, we evaluated the
ratio between CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells—lower
ratios typically indicate a weakened immune system and
are associated with more frequent infections [9]. This
ratio was lower 8 days after tMCAo when compared to
sham surgery for WT controls, but it did not change
significantly in IFN-βKO mice (Fig. 5g). Thus, strokeinduced reductions in splenocyte numbers and CD3
+
CD4+/CD3+CD8+ T cell ratio were absent in IFN-βKO
mice. The percentages of CD3+CD4+ Th, CD4+CD25+
Treg, CD3+CD8+ TC, and CD8+CD122+ Treg cells did not
differ among experimental conditions (Additional file 3).
IFN-β KO mice show reduced IL-1β and IL-5 plasma
concentrations after tMCAo

The observed changes in immune cell populations could
be accompanied by changes in plasma cytokine levels.
Moreover, under inflammatory conditions, IFN-β may
promote a Th1-Th2 shift [13]. Therefore, we quantified
the protein concentrations of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in
the plasma of IFN-βKO mice and WT controls 2 and
8 days after tMCAo/sham surgery. We found lower IL-1β
(Fig. 6a) and IL-5 (Fig. 6b) levels in mice lacking IFN-β
2 days after tMCAo. Finally, while in WT mice, IFN-γ
levels decreased 2 days after tMCAo versus respective
sham surgery; in IFN-βKO mice, IFN-γ levels were
unchanged (Fig. 6c). The genotype did not influence
IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, mKC, and TNF-α levels
(Additional file 5).
Lack of IFN-β signaling resulted in a reduction in body
weight and decrease in grip strength after stroke

Along with its effect on the inflammatory response,
abrogation of IFN-β could lead to important differences
in physiological parameters, including weight and body
temperature post-stroke. Body weight, in particular, is an
important outcome measure in neurological conditions.
To no surprise, stroke significantly affected both weight
and body temperature (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively, mixed model ANOVA), and two main differences
were apparent between IFN-βKO and WT mice. First,
while no significant weight loss was noted in the WT
group, IFN-βKO mice showed a higher weight loss 2
and 3 days after tMCAo than after sham surgery,
(Table 1). In WT mice, body temperature decreased significantly 24 h after stroke (tMCAo compared to sham

mice (Table 1). In addition to addressing physiological
parameters, we evaluated sensorimotor performance

through multiple behavioral tests, including the grip
strength test, by which we observed a decrease in forepaw grip strength 2 days post-occlusion in the IFN-βKO
group only (Fig. 7a, b). We did not find any significant
difference between the two genotypes when using the
composite neuroscore (24 h after tMCAo, Fig. 7c) or the
rotating pole test (2 and 8 days after tMCAo, Fig.7d, e).
Nonetheless, in the rotating pole test, spontaneous recovery was evident for both groups. When determining
infarct volumes 2 and 8 days after tMCAo, we did not
find a significant effect of IFN-β abrogation (Fig. 7f, g).
Survival rates within 2 and 8 days after tMCAo did not
differ between groups (in total, 7 of 29 WT and 1 of 26
IFN-βKO mice died within 2 days; 3 of 10 WT and 1 of
9 IFN-βKO mice died within 8 days); with respect to
sham-operated animals, mortality was zero. To exclude
a potential model bias, IFN-βKO and WT mice also
were subjected to pMCAo and allowed to recover for
2 days. Consistently, infarct volumes of IFN-βKO mice
were similar to that of WT controls (Fig. 7h).
IFN-β acts through the IFNAR. Thus, to investigate
further the impact of endogenous IFN-β signaling in
stroke outcome, we subjected IFNAR-KO mice and WT
counterparts to tMCAo and evaluated behavior and
infarct volumes 2 days after. Physiological parameters,
including body temperature and weight loss were similar
between IFNAR-KO and WT mice, and we did not find
a significant genotype-related difference in behavioral
performance after tMCAo, as assessed by the grip
strength test. Nevertheless, tMCAo caused a decrease in
grip strength when using the contralateral paw, demonstrating a stroke-induced asymmetry in grip strength
(Fig. 7i). In line with our findings in IFN-β KO mice, the
infarct volumes of IFNAR-KO mice were similar to that
of WT controls both 48 h after tMCAo (Fig. 7j) and
24 h after pMCAo (Fig. 7k). Moreover, mortality did not
differ significantly between groups (4 of 11 WT and 1 of
10 IFNAR-KO mice died).

Discussion
In rodents, the first week post-stroke is thought to constitute a critical period for the formation of the infarct
core and activation of mechanisms that promote or
repress recovery, in both of which inflammation plays a
major role [1]. Although the critical impact of inflammation on stroke outcome is well accepted, a unified view
on underlying molecular and cellular determinants
remains to be established. Given its reported antiinflammatory capacity and use in the treatment of
relapsing-remitting MS, IFN-β has been put forward as a
candidate drug for acute stroke treatment. However, the
inflammatory response post-stroke is highly dynamic,
both spatially and temporally, and the precise modes of
action and effects IFN-β in stroke remain largely
unexplored. First, literature reporting on the therapeutic
potential of IFN-β in stroke is sparse and controversial
[18–22]. Secondly, the function of endogenous IFN-β
signaling, which may enable a better understanding of
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and thus a
potentially higher success in designing the future treatment of stroke, had not been explored.
We provide evidence that endogenous IFN-β regulates
the post-stroke inflammatory response, in the brain and
periphery, and we reveal its specific actions. Previous
studies have consistently shown that CD11b+ cells found
within the brain parenchyma can express relatively high
or low levels of CD45, the first including infiltrating leukocytes (notably monocyte-derived macrophages) and
the second resident microglia [2, 5, 32]. In C57BL/6
mice, CD45highCD11b+ cells accumulate in the brain
parenchyma within the first days after focal cerebral
ischemia [2, 4]. Our results indicate that endogenous
IFN-β signaling limits the local accumulation of bloodoriginating cells that occurs after stroke. Indeed,
following tMCAo, IFN-βKO mice showed a higher
percentage of CD45highCD11b+ cells in ipsilateral hemispheres, and a higher number of CD45+ cells within the

infarct core than their WT counterparts. This finding is
in line with previous studies showing that, in rats,
administration of rIFN-β consistently reduced the

number of leukocytes in the brain up to 7 days after
stroke, despite the usage of different administration protocols [19, 21]. The percentage of CD45highCD11b+ cells

Inácio et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:211

expressing the activation marker MHCII did not differ
significantly between the IFN-βKO and WT groups. Yet,
given the larger percentage of CD45highCD11b+ cells,
these data likely reflect a higher total number of
CD45highCD11b+MHCII+ cells in the absence of IFN-β.
In contrast to its effects on CD45highCD11b+ cells, abrogation of IFN-β did not result in concomitant changes in
the percentages of CD45dimCD11b+ cells or respective
MHCII expression. Albeit the debate surrounding the
exact nature and dynamics of the macrophages/microglial response after stroke, the lack of an increase in the
relative numbers of microglia and activated microglia
2 days after tMCAo (Fig. 2d) probably reflects a delay in
the accumulation and activation of the microglial population at the injury site. Indeed, the dramatic increase in
the expression of Iba-1 and Gal-3 observed at 8 days
after tMCAo is unlikely to result predominantly from
invading macrophages [4]. This delay might be related, at least in part, to the extent of cerebral damage [10, 12, 30, 40]. We also show that Iba-1 and Gal-3
immunoreactivities 8 days after stroke induction are unaltered by the abrogation of IFN-β, suggesting that, in
stroke, IFN-β rather acts by diminishing a relatively earlier
leukocytic central invasion. Indeed, it is likely that the
enhanced accumulation of leukocytes observed in the
brains of IFN-βKO reflects an increase in the infiltration
of these cells into the brain parenchyma. This could occur
via a relative decrease in BBB integrity, through an
enhanced activity of metalloproteinase-9 [19]. However,
when analyzing IgG and claudin-5 signals, reflecting vessel
extravasation and tight junction function, respectively, in
the infarct core and/or peri-infract region, we did not find
evidence for alterations in post-stroke BBB integrity induced by knocking out the gene encoding IFN-β, at least
not 2 days after tMCAo. Yet on the other hand, it has
been previously reported that, during EAE, IFN-βKO mice
show an increase in the levels of circulating chemokines
(namely CCL3 and CCL5), which also could underlie an
increased leukocytic infiltration into the brain parenchyma
in comparison to their WT counterparts [41]. Similarly,
lack of IFNAR in mice has been shown to relate to an
increase in leukocyte numbers and metalloproteinase-9
expression, as well as to a decrease in the chemoattractant
CXCL10 in the CNS under inflammatory conditions [42].
Nevertheless, as indicated by a recent report, local regulatory mechanisms exerted by endogenous IFN-β [43], such
as controlling local proliferation and activation of innate
immune cells, cannot be excluded at present.
In addition to attenuating central inflammation, our
results indicate that IFN-β is important in regulating
peripheral immune cell subsets. Most notably, IFN-βKO
mice showed a higher total percentage of circulating
B220+ (immature) B cells, but similar percentages of circulating B220+MHCII+ (mature and activated) B cells in

Page 15 of 18

relation to WT counterparts, 2 days after tMCAo. This
set of data indicates that the ratio of proliferative B cells
is lower in WT mice, which is consistent with the general anti-proliferative role of IFN-β. In fact, the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic actions of IFN-β are well
documented [15, 43]. In support of a previous report
[15], no major Th1-Th2 shift was detected between genotypes. Interestingly, however, IL-1β and IL-5 plasma concentrations decreased in the IFN-βKO group, and these
cytokines have been extensively associated with multiple
aspects of B cell function, including proliferation [44, 45].
Although we found similar numbers of splenocytes and
splenic B cells in WT and IFN-βKO 2–8 days after
tMCAo, higher numbers of circulating B cells also could
be due, at least in part, to an increased mobilization of
these cell population from splenic or other (notably
thymic) pools. It is worth noting that the decrease in
circulating B220+ B cells following tMCAo might be in
agreement with previous studies showing a strokeinduced apoptotic loss of B lymphocytes [7, 11].
Besides its effects on circulating immune cells, we also
provide evidence for a role of IFN-β in the regulation of
splenic immune cell subsets. Indeed, the IFN-βKO group
did not show a stroke-induced decrease in the total
number of splenocytes, and multiple observations point
toward a differential regulation of CD11b+, NK, NKT,
and T cells in the presence and absence of endogenous
IFN-β. First, only IFN-βKO mice showed a significant
increase in the percentage of CD11b+ cells in the spleen
2 days after tMCAo (compared to sham surgery). In line
with B cell results, this data possibly reflects a higher
proliferative capacity of CD11b+ cells in IFN-βKO mice.
Second, in the IFN-βKO group, stroke did not lead to a
transient increase in NK cells (otherwise observed in
WT mice) or to significant changes in the percentage of
NKT cells. Third, a stroke-induced reduction in the
CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+ T cell ratio was absent in IFNβKO mice. Abrogation of IFN-β also led to a lack of
suppression of IFN-γ levels 2 days after tMCAo. The
described peripheral changes converge toward an overall
deficient immunoregulation in the IFN-βKO group, which
could explain the increased brain inflammation. It is worth
noting that while sham-operated IFN-βKO mice did have
smaller spleens, and that deletion of IFN-β was previously
shown to cause structural alterations, along with a decrease
in resident macrophages in the spleen [46], we did not find
significant shifts in immune cell populations in the spleen
(or blood). Moreover, at least a certain degree of responsiveness of IFN-β splenocytes (particularly CD11b+ cells) to
the post-stroke milieu appears to have been preserved.
In relapsing-remitting EAE, endogenous IFN-β signaling is sufficient to limit inflammation and promote a
better disease outcome [15]. Here, IFN-β KO mice, in
contrast to their WT counterparts, showed a significant

Inácio et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:211

weight loss, one of the most accepted consequences of
neuroinflammatory conditions (such as EAE), and a significant reduction in grip strength 2–3 days after stroke.
Using other behavioral approaches, different time points
after stroke induction, and the receptor knockout, we
could not detect further differences in sensorimotor deficits. Also, we show, not only at the level of the cytokine
but also at the level of the receptor and using two
models of stroke, tMCAo and pMCAo, that endogenous
IFN-β signaling does not influence infarct volume 2 to
8 days after stroke. On the one hand, and albeit having found no difference in body temperature between
IFN-βKO mice and WT controls, a potential differential
effect of our post-surgical care strategy on infarct volume
cannot be ruled out at present. In addition, differences in
the extent of sensorimotor deficits or in the functional recovery curve may have been masked by the sensitivity of
behavioral tests. Yet on the other hand, these results are
consistent with two previous studies showing no effect of
IFN-β administration within the first 3–7 days following
ischemic stroke [21], and more recently, subarachnoid
hemorrhage [22]. We hypothesize that this uncoupling between inflammatory changes and, to some extent, outcome is due to the multiple actions of IFN-β. While it
may limit the accumulation of immune and inflammatory
cells in the brain, it may also, via anti-proliferative and
pro-aptoptotic actions contribute to stroke-induced peripheral immunosuppression. In fact, it also is becoming
increasingly clear that, within the injured CNS, inflammatory and immune cells may play both pro- and antiinflammatory roles [47]. A CNS injury-induced peripheral
immunosuppression may serve to diminish a potentially
harmful immune response toward the brain, particularly
given the exposure of self-antigens [48], but a certain
degree of autoimmunity may be beneficial [49]. Moreover,
peripheral immunosuppression has been associated to an
increased susceptibility to infections, which constitutes a
common cause of death after cerebral ischemia [9, 12].

Conclusions
We conclude that endogenous IFN-β signaling critically
regulates inflammation, and it may positively impact
acute stroke outcome. Our study evidences the complexity of inflammatory alterations provided by lack of a
specific inflammatory mediator following stroke, which
should be taken into account in the development of
immunomodulatory therapies.
