Abstract—Many studies of brain ischemia have shown the role played by massive ischemia-induced
production of reactive oxygen species, the main mechanism of neuronal death. However, currently, there
is no treatment choice to prevent cell death triggered by reactive oxygen species. In our study, we
researched the effects of tannic acid, an antioxidant, on the ischemic tissue of rats with induced middle
cerebral artery occlusion. The animals were divided into three groups of eight animals. The sham group
were only administered 10 % ethanol intraperitoneally, the second group had middle cerebral artery
occlusion induced and were given 10 % ethanol intraperitoneally, while the third group had middle
cerebral artery occlusion with 10 mg/kg dose tannic acid dissolved in 10 % ethanol administered within
half an hour intraperitoneally. The rats were sacrificed 24 h later, and brain tissue was examined
biochemically and histopathologically. Biochemical evaluation of brain tissue found that comparing
the ischemic group with no treatment with the tannic acid-treated ischemia group; the superoxide
dismutase (SOD) levels were higher, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were lower, and nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) was higher in the tannic acid-treated group. Histopathological examination
showed that the histopathological results of the tannic acid group were better than the group not given
tannic acid. Biochemical and histopathological results showed that tannic acid administration had an
antioxidant effect on the negative effects of ischemia in brain tissue.

In spite of stroke being a serious life-threatening risk
and causing disability, the only effective accepted treatment is tissue plasminogen activators [4]. However, the
duration limitations of this treatment mean it can only be
given to a small proportion of patients, 1–2 % [5].
Many studies of brain ischemia have shown the role
played by massive ischemia-induced production of reactive oxygen species, the main mechanism of neuronal
death [6]. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species cause
destruction of cell proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and DNA
leading to neuronal death [7, 8]. However, currently, there
is no treatment choice to prevent cell death triggered by
reactive oxygen species. With tissue plasminogen activators administered to a small proportion of patients and no
preventive treatment for neuron death due to reactive oxygen species, many animal studies in recent years have
attempted to find a variety of agents effective in healing
ischemic tissue.
In our study, we tried tannic acid (TA) which has
antioxidant [9], anti-inflammatory [10], anti-tumor [11],

INTRODUCTION
In the USA, deaths related to stroke are third after
cancer and heart diseases, and it is also one of the most
important causes of disability [1]. In the USA alone, it is
estimated that 795,000 new stroke cases develop every
year [2]. Of stroke patients, a significant proportion of
80 % have ischemic events [3].

[14]. The plants it is most easily obtained from are tea and
coffee [15]. TA is a strong antioxidant. This property is due
to it being a chelator of prooxidant metals [16]. At the same
time, TA is a better antioxidant than frequently used antioxidants such as vitamins C and E [17].

reveal the common carotid artery and internal-external
carotid artery. The common carotid artery bifurcation was
cut and a 4.0 nylon suture thread with a curved tip was
advanced toward the internal carotid artery. When a slight
resistance was felt, the advance was stopped and the external carotid artery was stitched. In the sham group, a similar
operation was completed; however, MCAO was not done.
Biochemical Analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (240–280 g) were used in
this study. All animals were kept in an environment with
12-h light, 12-h darkness, and given access to food and
water ad libitum. The methods used in the animal experiments were in accordance with the National Institute of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
protocols. Necessary permissions were obtained from the
Canakkale Onsekiz Mart University Animal Experiments
Local Ethics Committee.
Experimental Design
The animals were randomly divided into three groups
with eight subjects in each group. The sham group was
only administered intraperitoneal 10 % ethanol. The second group had middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
induced, were given 10 % ethanol intraperitoneally, and
were named the MCAO group. The third group had
MCAO induced, and within half an hour, 10 mg/kg dose
of tannic acid dissolved in 10 % ethanol was given intraperitoneally and were named the MCAO-T group; twentyfour hours later before the rats were sacrificed. Craniotomy
was completed, and the whole brain was removed. The
right hemisphere was stored at −80 °C in sterile plastic
tubes for biochemical investigation. The right hemisphere
of those with MCAO induced was fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution for histopathological and immunohistochemical investigations.
Surgical Procedure
Before surgical procedure all animals were given
intraperitoneal xylazine (5 mg/kg) and ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/kg); respiration was spontaneous and at
room temperature. The operation was completed under
sterile conditions. Body temperature was held to 37±0.5 °C.
MCAO was induced according to previously described
methods [18]. The rats were incised at the neck to

After tissue samples were pulverized with liquid nitrogen; they were homogenized with 1 ml cold PBS on ice
at 20,000 rpm for 30 s. The homogenate obtained was
centrifuged at 10,000 G at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant
was put in another tube. All samples were stored at −80 °C
until use. On the study day, the samples were thawed at 2–
8 °C.
Measurement of Serum Protein and Superoxide
Dismutase, Malondialdehyde, and Nuclear Respiratory
Factor-1 Levels in Brain Tissue
Protein levels were measured with the Lowry method
using the manufacturer’s guidelines for the Modified Lowry Protein Assay Kit (Catalogue No. 23240, Thermo Scientific, USA) and results are given as milligram per
milliliter.
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were photometrically measured according to the manufacturer’s guidelines for the SOD Assay Kit (Catalogue No. 706002,
Cayman Chemical Company, USA). Results are divided
by protein amount and given as unit per milliliter per
milligram.
Malondialdehyde (MDA) and nuclear respiratory
factor-1 (NRF-1) levels were measured using the ELISA
method according to the manufacturer’s guidelines for Rat
Malondialdehyde ELISA Kit (Cat. No. CK-E30266, Hangzhou Eastbiopharm Co. Ltd., Hangzhou, China) and the
Rat Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 ELISA Kit (Cat. No. CKE90555, Hangzhou Eastbiopharm Co. Ltd., Hangzhou,
China). MDA and NRF-1 results were divided by amount
of protein and are given as nanomole per milliliter per
milligram protein and nanogram per milliliter per milligram protein, respectively.
Histopathological Examination
The brains were left in 10 % neutral formaldehyde
solution. After 24 h in fixative, they were washed in
running water for 6–8 h, passed through ethanol-xylene
series for automatic tissue monitoring (Citadel 2000,

immersed in liquid paraffin. Tissues were cut into
4–6 μm sections for hematoxylin-eosin and luxol fast
blue staining and in 3–4 μm sections for immunohistochemical staining. They were examined under a
light microscope at different magnifications and
photographed.
Sections cut for immunohistochemical staining
were left in xylene twice for 10 min, passed through
an alcohol series (70–99 %), and placed in 3 %

H 2 O 2 solution for 20 min. After washing with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), they were heated
at 800 W for 5 min in citrate buffer solution four
times and left to cool for 15 min and placed in
distilled water for 5 min. After being left in PBS
for 10 min, they were placed in secondary blocking
material for 20–30 min. Each preparation [anti-caspase 3 antibody (ab4051), Abcam plc, Cambridge,
UK; and anti-caspase- 9 antibody (ab32539), Abcam

different dilutions (1/200–1/250) for 60–75 min.
Chromogenous diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution
was used for inverse staining and Mayer’s hematoxylin was used for staining. For negative controls PBS
was used. Preparations were covered with an appropriate material and photographed. The results of immunohistochemical staining were evaluated based on
the percentage area of immunopositive reaction in
one of the four categories: slight (+), moderate
(++), intense (+++), and very intense (++++). The
results were statistically evaluated using nonparametric tests. In each preparation stained with hematoxylin, 15 different areas were examined. These areas
were each 1200 μm square, and within this frame,
the remaining neuronal cells were counted for cell
density measurements.

Statistical Analysis
For statistical evaluation of the study, SPSS 19.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used. Descriptive
statistics are given as mean and standard deviation values.
For statistical analysis, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used. The Bonferroni test was used for

those with significant differences. Non-numerical variables
were analyzed with nonparametric tests.

RESULTS
In our study, the biochemical SOD, MDA, and NRF1 levels in the brain tissue of rats in all three groups were
studied. SOD levels were significantly lower in the MCAO
group compared to the sham group, while the decrease in
SOD levels in the MCAO-T group was less than that of the
MCAO group, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). MDA levels were higher in the MCAO
group compared to the sham group; in the MCAO-T group,
the increase in MDA levels was significantly less, and the
difference between the MCAO-T and MCAO group was
statistically significant (p<0.05). NRF-1 values had decreased in the MCAO group compared to those in the sham
group; the decrease in the MCAO-T group was less; however, comparing the MCAO group with the MCAO-T
group, the difference was not statistically significant
(p<0.05) (Fig. 1).
The histopathological evaluation of the groups was
completed with hematoxylin and eosin staining, luxol fast

blue staining, and anti-caspase- 3 and anti-caspase- 9 staining (Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 5). Histopathological evaluation
showed cell vacuolization, cellular degeneration, and edema effects were less in the MCAO-T group compared to
that in the MCAO group. The numbers of red neurons in
the sham and MCAO-T groups were approximately equal
(Table 1).
While caspase- 3 activity in the MCAO-T group was
close to that of the sham group, it was increased in the
MCAO group. Caspase- 9 activity in the MCAO and
MCAO-T groups were similar (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
It is known with certainly that in the development of
brain damage linked to ischemia, oxidative stress is a very
important factor. Ischemia due to permanent occlusion of
the MCA leads to an increase in free radical levels causing
a fall in activity of SOD, an antioxidant enzyme, thus
reducing the activity of protective antioxidants. At the
same time, brain tissue is more sensitive to this oxidative
destruction compared to other tissues, because neurons are
rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and antioxidant enzyme
levels are low [19]. Free radicals formed by brain ischemia
damage the cellular components of neurons such as

protein, lipid, and DNA [20]. Accumulation of these free
radicals cause destruction of a variety of cellular components by lipid peroxidation and thus the level of MDA, a
product of lipid peroxidation, increases [21, 22]. In our
study, the decrease in SOD levels in the MCAO-T group
was significantly lower than that in the MCAO group,
while the MDA levels rose by less was also significant.
These results indicate that TA with antioxidant properties
activated the protective mechanisms against the adverse
effects of ischemia. Increasing antioxidant enzyme levels,
such as SOD, is thought to show a struggle with oxidative
stress caused by ischemia linked to MCAO.
In many neurological diseases, disruption of mitochondrial function is a basic pathophysiological mechanism [23]. However, while the relationship between neuronal damage and mitochondria is well-studied, the role of
mitochondrial biogenesis after cerebral insults is not well
understood [24]. Mitochondrial biogenesis developing after ischemic brain damage allows healing of damage, and
NRF-1 gene expression is very important for transcriptional regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis [24, 25]. NRF-1
increase after ischemia indicates regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis. After ischemic brain damage in exercised
rats, an increase in NRF-1 showing mitochondrial biogenesis was observed [26]. In our study, the NRF-1 increase in
the MCAO-T group was greater than in that in the MCAO

group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. In studies where NRF-1 increase was observed, the
ischemic duration was shorter than in our study. For example, in rats with transient ischemic attack induced carotid
ligation lasted a short time of 30 min, and for rats with
induced hypoxia after 2.5 h of hypoxia, the rats were left,
and at the 6th and 24th hour, NRF-1 levels were measured.
For rats with exercise after ischemic brain damage, ischemia lasted 60 min and 5 days exercise treatment was given
[24, 26, 27]. In all these studies mentioned, there was an
increase in NRF-1 levels; however, ischemia lasted for less
time and the rats survived for longer. At the same time, in a
study of measurements after ischemia, it was observed that
it took 24 h to reach pre-ischemic mitochondrial DNA
levels [28]. While the increase was not significant, this
may be due to the longer duration of ischemia when
compared with other studies or to short-term application
of TA treatment.
The caspase family facilitates apoptosis. Caspase- 9
has an initiator effect on apoptosis and activates caspase- 3,
while caspase- 3 facilitates cellular breakdown [29]. In our
study, caspase- 3 and caspase- 9 levels were measured. Caspase- 3 activity was at similar levels in the
MCAO-T group and sham group, while an increase
was observed in the MCAO group. Caspase- 9 levels
were similar in the MCAO-T and MCAO groups.
Caspase- 3 activity similar to the sham group shows
the protective effect of TA administration against
apoptosis.
Histopathological evaluation indicated that the cell
vacuolization, cellular degeneration, and edema effects
were less in the TA group compared to the MCAO group
not given TA. Red neuron counts in the sham and MCAOT groups were similar. With these, results show that the TA
is protective effect against the negative histopathological
effects of ischemia.
In conclusion, current results show the positive
effects of TA administration on ischemic tissue.
However, the need for longer administration of TA
and more developed studies is clear. The lack of
antioxidant treatment choices for cerebral ischemia
means that advanced studies should be designed
based on the positive effects of TA.
