Animal models of focal cerebral ischemia are well accepted for investigating the pathogenesis and potential treatment strategies
for human stroke. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) with an endovascular filament is a widely used model to induce
focal cerebral ischemia. However, this model is not amenable to thrombolytic therapies. As thrombolysis with recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is a standard of care within 4.5 h of human stroke onset, suitable animal models that mimic
cellular and molecular mechanisms of thrombosis and thrombolysis of stroke are required. By occluding the MCA with a fibrin-rich
allogeneic clot, we previously developed an embolic model of MCA occlusion in the rat, which recapitulates the key components of
thrombotic development and of thrombolytic therapy of rtPA observed from human ischemic stroke. Here we describe in detail the
surgical procedures of our model, including preparing emboli from rat donors. These procedures can be typically completed within
~30 min, and they are highly adaptable to other strains of rats, as well as mice, in both sexes. Thus, this model provides a powerful
tool for translational stroke research.

INTRODUCTION
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability, affecting 15 million
people globally each year. Over 80% of stroke is caused by the
obstruction of a cerebral artery by an endovascular embolus
or thrombus formation. Unfortunately, treatment options for
stroke are limited. Since approval by the US Food and Drug
Administration in 1996, i.v. administration of rtPA, which dissolves the obstructive clot to restore blood flow1, remains the only
treatment for patients within 4.5 h of stroke onset. However, only
a small percentage of patients with ischemic stroke are eligible
for rtPA treatment, owing to its narrow therapeutic window and
the risk of brain hemorrhage2–4. To improve our understanding
of the pathogenesis of stroke and to bring thrombolytic therapy and other potential therapeutic approaches to more stroke
patients, suitable animal models that mimic the pathophysiology
of ischemic stroke are required.
Human stroke most frequently affects the territory of the
MCA5. Spontaneous thrombolytic lysis occurs in human stroke6.
Occlusion of the MCA by various methods in rodents generates
reproducible ischemic brain damage and has been widely used to
study the underlying molecular mechanisms and potential treatment strategies for stroke. Occlusion of the MCA with an intraluminal filament is the most frequently used minimally invasive
stroke model in rodents, which allows retraction of the filament
from the MCA at variable durations to produce permanent or
transient focal ischemia7. However, re-perfusion achieved by
retraction of the filament cannot model the biological events
of thrombolysis8. There are additional models for inducing
stroke, all with merits and limitations (Table 1). Notably, large
failures of neuroprotective clinical trials for acute stroke treatment highlight that neuroprotection alone without restoration
of tissue perfusion and vascular integrity may not be adequate
for treatment of acute stroke9–12. Treatment of acute stroke needs
to restore the normal function of the neurovascular unit by rapidly re-establishing cerebral blood flow in the ischemic cerebral
microvascular bed, preserving vascular integrity and minimizing
cell death13.
We developed a clinically relevant model of embolic ischemia
in the rat that closely mimics the pathological features of

t­ hromboembolic stroke14–16. By precise delivery of a naturally
formed allogeneic embolus to the origin of the MCA, we observe
the dynamic development of thrombotic formation at the embolic
occluded MCA site and the secondary thrombosis in the downstream cerebral microvessels of the MCA14–16. The ischemic cell
damage is predictable and reproducible, which is well confined
within the territory supplied by the MCA14–16. Longitudinal MRI
analysis of this model reveals spontaneous recanalization of the
occluded MCA ~24 h or later after stroke17. Moreover, i.v. administration of rtPA within 2 h of MCA occlusion (MCAO) promotes
recanalization, substantially improves downstream microvascular
perfusion and integrity and considerably reduces infarct size, consequently leading to improved neurological outcomes18–20. Thus,
this model provides the key components of thromboembolic
development and of thrombolytic therapy of rtPA observed in
human ischemic stroke21,22. This embolic model of focal cerebral
ischemia has been widely used for the evaluation of thrombolytic
therapies and potential adjuvant agents to thrombolysis23–30. Here
we provide a detailed protocol on how to generate this model
starting from the preparation of an embolus. The surgical procedures to occlude the MCA are minimally invasive, and they can
be typically completed within 30 min.
Advantages and limitations
The key advantages of our model are as follows:
• A single embolus blocks the origin of the MCA. Thus, the ischemic
cell damage is well confined within the territory supplied by the MCA,
leading to predicable and reproducible focal cerebral ischemia.
• Secondary thrombosis is formed at the site at which the embolus
resided and in downstream cerebral microvessels. Spontaneous
recanalization of the occluded MCA occurs at 24 h or later.
• Impairment of sensorimotor function can be assayed.
• Intravenous administration of rtPA within 2 h of the onset of
MCAO induces recanalization, increases downstream microvascular
perfusion and reduces ischemic cell damage.
• Adjunct use of rtPA with neuroprotective agents extends the
therapeutic window of thrombolysis and reduces hemorrhagic
transformation.

Models

Advantages

Photothrombosis59,60

Reproducible ischemic brain damage

Often requires craniotomy, and the ischemic lesion mainly
localizes to the cortex

Artificial emboli61,62

Minimally invasive and mimics the multifocal
and heterogonous nature of human stroke

Uncontrollable lodgment of emboli, high variation in infarct
size and not suitable for thrombolysis

Blood emboli63–65

Susceptible to thrombolytic therapies

Uncontrollable embolization site and occlusion time, and large
variations in infarct size and location

The main limitation of our model is that it specifically blocks
the origin of the MCA, which produces a large ischemic lesion
that encompasses the entire MCA territory. However, with modification of the embolus length, a small cortical ischemic lesion in
downstream MCA territory can be produced31.

Limitations

Experimental design
Preparation of embolus. The formation of a single fibrin-rich
allogeneic clot is an essential step for the generation of reproducible ischemic brain damage. Young healthy rats are used as donors
for arterial blood collection. An ex vivo–formed whole-blood clot
contains all blood elements, such as red blood cells (RBCs) and
platelets. A red clot that contains many RBCs is relatively fragile.
Therefore, to attain a single fibrin-rich white clot, a gentle wash
with saline is needed to remove entrapped RBCs. In addition, it
is necessary to maintain the flexibility of the clot, as platelet and
RBCs modulate the structure and hardness of the clot and are
resistant to thrombolysis32,33. All emboli should be used within
24–30 h after blood collection.
Preparation of endovascular cathethers. To ensure successful
delivery of a single clot to the orgin of the MCA, polyethylene
catheters (PE-50, inner diameter (i.d.) 0.58 mm, outer diameter
(o.d.) 0.965 mm) are modified by reducing the o.d. to 0.3 mm at
one end, which permits easy access to the intracranial portion of
the internal carotid artery (ICA).

MCAO. To induce MCAO, it is crucial to place a single embolus
at the origin of the MCA, which reduces mortality by eliminating obstruction of the posterior communicating arteries that are
unavoidably blocked in the endovascular filament model. The
procedures that we describe herein are based on our extensive
experience using male adult Wistar rats, in which the distance
between the origin of the MCA and the site of arteriotomy on
the external carotid artery (ECA, the distal entry site of catheter)
are ~19–22 mm. Thus, lodging of the embolus at the origin of
the MCA can be attained by advancing the catheter from the ECA
arteriotomy site into the ICA until its tip is situated 1–2 mm proximal to the origin of the MCA. Owing to the anatomic and surgical variations, the distance between the origin of the MCA and
the arteriotomy may vary. Thus, the catheter is initially advanced
18 mm, and then it is further advanced gently for 1–3 mm until
resistance is felt, which indicates that the catheter has reached the
origin of the MCA owing to the anatomic narrowing and tortuosity
of the artery anterior to the origin of the MCA. The catheter is
then retracted 1–2 mm to ensure the correct placement at 1–2 mm
proximal to the origin of the MCA. Sham-operated rats are used
as controls. For the control, rats are subjected to an identical
surgical procedure, but the embolus is not injected. Although the
procedures were primarily developed for young adult Wistar rats,
these procedures are highly adaptable to other strains of the rat,
the mouse and the aged rodent. This is achieved by adjusting the
size of the embolus and the length of the catheter30,31,34.

PROCEDURE
Blood collection from the femoral artery ● TIMING 20–30 min
1|	 Anesthetize a donor rat with 3% (vol/vol) isoflurane in 70% (vol/vol) N2O and 30% (vol/vol) O2 within an inducing
chamber, and then transfer the rat to the surgical table with anesthesia maintained with 1.5% isoflurane throughout the
surgical procedure.
 CRITICAL STEP Avoid rats with fresh cuts, bruises, bite marks and with signs of stress, because these events may
compromise the clotting process.

2|	 Place the rat in supine position and retract both hind limbs posteriorly and laterally to expose the femoral triangle.
Hold the limbs in position with surgical tapes, and shave the inguinal region over the right femoral triangle with a clipper.
3|	 Apply 10% povidone-iodine and 70% isopropyl alcohol pads (vol/vol) to disinfect the incision site.
4|	 Make an incision (~10 mm) along the femur above the femoral triangle.
5|	 Bluntly dissect the connective tissues with a hemostatic forceps, and expose the femoral artery, vein and nerve bundle.
6|	 Expose 5–8 mm of femoral artery from the femoral neurovascular bundle by careful blunt dissection of the femoral nerve
and vein with a hemostatic forceps.
7|	 Ligate the femoral artery distally with a 4-0 silk suture, and then transiently block blood flow with an aneurysm clip at
the proximal end of the femoral artery.
8|	 Place a 4-0 silk suture loosely around the femoral artery between the ligation and the clamped site.
9|	 Create a partial arteriotomy between the two sutures with a microscissors, and then insert a sterile PE-50 tubing
(400–500 mm) along the artery toward the proximal direction until it reaches the clamped site. Tighten the 4-0 silk suture
between the ligation and clip to secure the tubing. Arterial blood collected in this length of the PE-50 tubing commonly
generates ~10 individual clots that are suitable for MCAO. The length of the tubing can be varied depending on how many
rats are scheduled for MCAO, up to 300 mm, which will generate ~6 emboli.
10| Release the clip slowly to allow the blood to spontaneously flow into the tubing, and re-apply the clip immediately after
the tubing is filled with blood.
 CRITICAL STEP To generate a uniform clot, it is essential that blood should flow smoothly and directly into the tubing.
Any manipulations such as forcibly withdrawing the blood with a syringe during blood collection will lead to the formation of
fragile segments of clots 24 h after collection, which are not suitable for MCAO.
11| Remove the PE-50 tubing and immediately tie the suture.
12| Remove the clip from the artery and close the incision with a 4-0 silk suture.
13| Place the rat back into its home cage and allow recovery from anesthesia.
14| Place blood-containing PE-50 tubing in a Petri dish at 37 °C for 2 h, and subsequently retain it at 4 °C for an
additional 22 h.
 CRITICAL STEP Lay blood-filled tubing flat and avoid unnecessary agitation during the 24-h incubation period.
Preparation of endovascular cathethers ● TIMING 10–20 min
15| Turn on a gas burner, and adjust the fire to a low to medium flame.

18| Sterilize the modified PE-50 tubing in Cidex OPA solution overnight, and then rinse with sterile saline at least three
times before use.
 CRITICAL STEP For easy advancement via the catheter to the origin of the MCA, the entire length of the modified tubing
should be at least 120 mm, including an ~22-mm-long portion from the tip with an o.d. of 0.3–0.4 mm (Fig. 1).
Preparation of embolus ● TIMING 10–20 min
19| Fill a Petri dish (100 × 20 mm) with sterile saline, and prepare an ~500-mm PE-10 tubing with one end connected to a
1-cc saline-filled syringe.
20| Cut the clot containing PE-50 tubing into ~50-mm segments in length, and connect the segment with the PE-10 tubing.
Next, push the syringe to flush the clot out of the PE-50 tubing into the saline-filled Petri dish. If multiple MCAO procedures
are planned in the same day, a longer segment of clot containing PE-50 tubing up to 300 mm can be used, which can
generate ~6 emboli.
21| Disconnect the PE-50 tubing from the PE-10 one. Draw and flush the clot into and out of the PE-10 tubing, respectively,
10–15 times to wash out the majority of the entrapped RBCs until the clot becomes white-pinkish in color (Fig. 1a).
 CRITICAL STEP To avoid folding and twisting of the clot, always draw the clot from its end with the tubing, and place the
clot into a straight line while flushing it back into the Petri dish.
 CRITICAL STEP Some clots remain red after 10–15 times of washing owing to their high RBC content. Although additional
washes could eliminate the remaining RBCs, we do not recommend additional washes, as excessive washing may tangle the
clot possibly owing to breakage or loss of fibrin strands. Therefore, we recommend that the clots that remain red in color
after washing be discarded to maintain consistency of the experiments.
? TROUBLESHOOTING
22| Cut the washed clot into 40 mm in length and then collect it into the modified PE-50 catheter that is connected to a
100-µl Hamilton microsyringe. The clot is now ready to be used (Fig. 1c). If multiple clots are made, the remaining clots can
be stored in a saline-filled Petri dish at room temperature (20–26 °C) for up to 4 h and should be discarded thereafter.
 CRITICAL STEP If the clot contains many RBCs or is relatively fragile, the clot will be broken into segments when it is
flushed out of the modified PE-50 catheter. Thus, when it is collected into the modified catheter, the clot should be flushed
out of the catheter once to make sure that the clot remains intact. Only intact single clots can be used to block the MCA.
During MCAO, the modified portion (tip) of the delivery catheter could be compressed by forceps that may cause damage to
the contained clot. Therefore, in addition to avoiding unnecessary pressure while handling the catheter, the clot should be
positioned ~22 mm distal to the tip of the catheter, which can eliminate potential damage to the clots (Fig. 2).
 PAUSE POINT Clots can be stored in a saline-filled Petri dish at room temperature for up to 4 h.

24| Place the rat in supine position and hold both forelimbs laterally with surgical tapes to expose the ventral neck area.
25| Make a 20–30-mm midline incision from the jaw to the shoulder, gently split the left and right sternohyoid muscles
along the midline with blunt dissection and retract the right sternohyoid laterally to expose the trachea.
26| Under an operating microscope and with careful blunt dissection, expose the right common carotid artery (CCA), which
is situated deeply beneath the sternohyoid muscles and sits laterally to the trachea.
27| Bluntly dissect the carotid sheath along the CCA rostrally until the ECA and ICA bifurcation is exposed without harming
the vagal nerve, which also lies within the carotid sheath.
 CRITICAL STEP Care must be taken to avoid injury to the vagal nerve during dissection. Do not excessively compress or tug
arteries with forceps, which could cause swelling or even rupture the arteries.
28| Ligate the ECA along with occipital artery (the first branch of ECA) 2–3 mm distal to the bifurcation with two 4-0 silk
sutures. Cut the ECA between the two ligations, and retract the proximal portion of the ECA stump laterally and caudally to
align the ECA with the ICA (Fig. 2a).
 CRITICAL STEP It is crucial that the ECA stump be positioned parallel to the CCA to advance the catheter into the
intracranial segment of the ICA.
29| Temporarily clamp the CCA and the ICA with an aneurysm clip, and apply a 4-0 silk suture loosely around the trunk of
the ECA near the bifurcation.
? TROUBLESHOOTING
30| Create a partial arteriotomy on the ECA, and then insert the tip of the clot-filled modified PE-50 catheter into the
arteriotomy. Advance the catheter rostrally toward the ICA until it reaches the clamp site. Tighten the 4-0 silk suture
around the ECA trunk to secure the tubing.
? TROUBLESHOOTING
31| Release the clip slowly and further advance the catheter within the ICA rostrally to enter the intracranial segment of the ICA
until resistance is felt. The total length of the catheter that has been advanced is ~19–22 mm from the ECA arteriotomy site.
 CRITICAL STEP The entire catheter along with the connected syringe should be aligned with the natural position of the ICA
while advancing the catheter. This is essential for the catheter to successfully enter the intracranial segment of the ICA via
bypassing the pterygopalatine artery, which branches from the extracranial segment of the ICA dorsally and medially (Fig. 2a).
32| Retract the catheter 1–2 mm, and slowly inject the clot with 5–10 µl of saline at a rate of 10 µl/min.
 CRITICAL STEP Slow injection is crucial, because this permits the clot to form a ball-like embolus large enough to obstruct
the origin of the MCA. However, forced injection pushes the clot into a thread-like embolus that is unable to block the origin
of the MCA (Fig. 1b), and it will probably be washed away by blood flow when the catheter is withdrawn.
 CRITICAL STEP If you are establishing the sham control, do not inject a clot during this step.

ANTICIPATED RESULTS
At 24 h after clot injection, a single embolus should be lodged at the intracranial segment of the ICA at the origin of the
MCA and/or at the M1 of the MCA without obstruction of the posterior communicating artery (PCA) (Fig. 2a,b). Histological
analysis should show an ischemic lesion in the territory of the right hemisphere supplied by the MCA (Fig. 2c,d). We have
an overall success rate of over 90% (469 of 500 rats) using this model based on the histological analysis of the ischemic
lesions. The mortality rate within 7 d after stroke is <10% (7 of 85 rats). Sham-operated control rats do not show any
ischemic lesions.
MRI angiogram and perfusion-weighted imaging analysis should confirm occlusion of the right MCA immediately after
delivery of the clot and substantial reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) within the territory supplied by the occluded MCA.
Although the spontaneous recanalization of MCA occurs 24 h after MCAO in some cases, the hypoperfusion within the MCA
territory persists (Fig. 3).
Ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry analysis shows the formation of secondary thrombosis at the occluded origin
of the MCA as evident by accumulation of platelets, fibrin and erythrocytes (Fig. 3b). Moreover, secondary thrombosis is
developed in downstream microvessels of the occluded MCA during 24 h, which is likely to contribute to the observed
hypoperfusion by perfusion-weighted imaging (Fig. 3a,c,d). The occurrence of secondary thrombosis following ischemic
stroke is well described in stroke patients35–38.
Neurological deficits are readily detectable immediately after recovery from anesthesia. Rats typically show contralateral
forelimb flexion and circling behavior, which indicates contralateral hemiplegia. Further sophisticated sensorimotor

therapeutic window and hemorrhagic complication observed
in thrombolytic therapy in human stroke; thus, it could be
used for studying the post-thrombolytic complications observed in some stroke patients. Indeed, this model has been widely
used for the examination of multiple adjuvant pharmacological agents designed to enhance the efficacy and/or to reduce the
adverse effects of thrombolytic therapy17,19,23,25,26,46–58.
In conclusion, the embolic stroke model presented here enables a controlled delivery of an allogeneic clot to the origin of
the MCA, which results in reproducible ischemic brain damage. Our model mimics the pathological features of the common
type of ischemic stroke in patients, which inevitably represents a valuable animal model for translation stroke research.
