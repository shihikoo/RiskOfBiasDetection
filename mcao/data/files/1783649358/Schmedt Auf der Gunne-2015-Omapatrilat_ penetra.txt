Abstract Omapatrilat (OMA), which simultaneously inhibits
the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the neutral endopeptidase (neprilysin (NEP)), is widely used in experimental protocols related to hypertension and heart failure. The
penetration of OMA across the blood–brain barrier (BBB)
and the effects of ACE/NEP inhibition on the recovery from
ischaemic stroke have not yet been investigated. Angiotensin
(Ang) I injected intracerebroventricularly (ICV) or intravenously (IV) is converted to Ang II by ACE and induces an
immediate increase in blood pressure. The pressor responses
to OMA administered ICV, orally or IV were studied in male
Wistar rats instrumented with an ICV and arterial and venous
catheters. OMA infused ICV rapidly appeared in the systemic
circulation and more effectively attenuated the systemic than
the central pressor responses to Ang I. OMA administered
orally (5, 25, 100 μmol/kg body weight) or IV (0.5, 1, 5,
25 μmol/kg body weight) completely abolished increases in
blood pressure to IV Ang I up to 2 h after treatment. The
pressor responses to ICV Ang I were not altered, indicating
that systemically administered OMA does not cross the BBB.
To study the effects of ACE and NEP inhibition in the brain on
the recovery from ischaemic stroke, OMA was infused ICV

over a 5-day period before and 24 h after the occlusion of the
middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 90 min. ICVapplication of
OMA had no effect on infarction volume and marginally improved neurological outcome. We demonstrate for the first
time that simultaneous inhibition of ACE and NEP in the brain
tissue does not alter the recovery from ischaemic stroke.

Introduction
The inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE),
the key enzyme of angiotensin (Ang) II biosynthesis, are successfully used in the treatment of hypertension and the prevention of the development of heart failure, cardiac remodelling after myocardial infarction, endothelial dysfunction and
albuminuria. Most of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors
result from the reduced formation of Ang II and inhibition of
the bradykinin (BK) degradation (Gohlke and Schölkens
2004). Neprilysin (NEP), also known as neutral endopeptidase (EC24.11), a zinc-dependent, membrane-bound
metallopeptidase, is involved in processing and catabolism
of a number of vasoactive peptides, including Ang I, natriuretic peptides, BK and adrenomedullin (see Mangiafico et al.
2013 for review). Omapatrilat (OMA), a vasopeptidase inhibitor, which simultaneously inhibits ACE and NEP, showed a
powerful antihypertensive efficacy in animal models of human essential hypertension and heart failure and was even
more effective in blood pressure control in hypertensive subjects than single ACE inhibitors (Robl et al. 1997; Burnett
1999; Kostis et al. 2004). However, an increased risk for angioedema (2.17 % OMA versus 0.68 % enalapril) prevented

940

the approval of OMA for the clinical use. Nevertheless, OMA
is still the most widely studied vasopeptidase inhibitor. As a
reference and lead compound of this class of drugs, OMA is
employed in experimental studies investigating the role of
ACE/NEP inhibition on cardiac remodelling and fibrosis or
vasomotor responses of blood vessels (Cuculi and Erne 2011;
Birner et al. 2012; Mangiafico et al. 2013; Dalzell et al. 2014;
von Lueder et al. 2014).
A large number of peptides processed by ACE and NEP,
e.g. Ang I, BK, enkephalins, substance P (SP), natriuretic
peptides, control multiple brain functions, such as cardiovascular and neuroendocrine regulations and behaviour. The peptides also play an important role in processes occurring in the
brain under various pathological conditions, like cerebral ischaemia, inflammation, neurodegeneration and apoptosis.
In vivo and ex vivo studies indicate that ACE in the brain
can be inhibited after systemic treatment with ACE inhibitors.
However, the results are rather equivocal and the penetration
of ACE inhibitors through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) remains a controversial topic (Unger et al. 1988; Gohlke et al.
1989). No attempt has been undertaken to study whether systemically administered OMA or other vasopeptidase inhibitors cross the BBB. Therefore, the first aim of the study was to
investigate in conscious rats the ability of orally or intravenously (IV) administered OMA to cross the BBB. The second
part of the study explores the effects of ACE/NEP inhibition in
the brain on the recovery from focal cerebral ischaemia.
During the course of the study, it has become apparent that
systemically administered OMA does not penetrate across the
BBB. To achieve an effective inhibition of ACE and NEP in
brain tissue, OMA was infused intracerebroventricularly
(ICV) by means of osmotic minipumps over a 5-day period
before and during 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) with reperfusion.

Materials and methods
General remark
The objective of the second part of the current study was to
obtain information on the role of brain ACE/NEP in the initiation and regulation of processes associated with focal cerebral ischaemia and to investigate the impact of an ACE/NEP
inhibition on stroke outcome. OMA does not penetrate across
the BBB, therefore, the mode of ICV application of OMA was
chosen. Although ICV infusion of drugs is not a clinically
relevant therapeutic approach, the study adhered in the majority of points to the current RIGOR Guidelines for Effective
Translational Research (Lapchak et al. 2013; RIGOR.

respect to blinding (see below), randomisation of the
treatment groups, inclusion and exclusion criteria,
monitoring of cerebral blood flow in each animal,
monitoring of arterial blood pressure and heart rate, control
of relevant physiological variables in blood, measurement of
infarction volume, assessment of neurological deficits,
mortality and to appropriate statistical evaluation of the
obtained data.
Animals
Male Wistar rats (300–320 g) obtained from Charles River,
Sulzfeld, Germany were housed under controlled conditions
with respect to temperature, humidity and 12-h light/12-h dark
cycle with free access to food and water. All efforts have been
made to minimise the suffering of animals. All experimental
protocols were approved by the Governmental Committee for
the Ethical use of Animals in the German Federal State of
Schleswig-Holstein.
Surgical methods
Chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg body weight) injected intraperitoneally was used as anaesthetic for all surgical procedures.
For ICV injections, polyethylene cannula (PP 20) was implanted into the left lateral cerebral ventricle. One polyethylene catheter (PP 50) was inserted through the femoral artery
into the abdominal aorta and another catheter was inserted into
the femoral vein. The catheters were filled with heparinised
saline, passed through a subcutaneous tunnel, sealed and secured at the back of the neck. The arterial catheter was used for
measurements of cardiovascular parameters and blood collections to determine physiological variables before, during and
after focal cerebral ischemia. The venous catheter was used
for IV administrations of OMA or vehicle. Experiments were
carried out 48 h after the catheter implantation.
Osmotic minipumps (ALZET Model No.2002, Charles
River, Sulzfeld, Germany), delivering solutions at a rate of
0.5 μl/h were filled with vehicle or with OMA (6 mmol/l)
and implanted subcutaneously 5 days before MCAO as described elsewhere (Dai et al. 1999). Focal cerebral ischemia
was induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA)
with a 4–0 nylon monofilament for 90 min. Reperfusion was
achieved by pulling out the monofilament (Dai et al. 1999).
Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was continuously monitored in each rat at one point (1 mm posterior to the bregma,
6 mm from the midline) on the surface of each hemisphere by
laser-Doppler-flowmetry (Periflux system 5000, PERIMED
AB, Järfälla, Sweden). Abrupt reduction of rCBF by approximately 75 to 90 % indicated a successful occlusion of the
MCA. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C with a

Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol (2015) 388:939–951

heating pad. Rats with subarachnoid haemorrhage were excluded from the experimental protocol.
General procedures
Recordings of blood pressure and heart rate
and determination of physiological variables in blood
All experiments were carried out in conscious, freely moving
rats. The arterial catheter was connected to the transducer and
the experiments were started when rats were resting and the
basal mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) values
were stable. Vehicle or OMA were injected IV through the
intravenous catheter connected to an extension catheter with
syringe. When OMA was administered intragastricaly, the arterial catheter was connected to the transducer after the treatment. Ang I was injected as a bolus IVat a dose of 50 pmol/kg
body weight before and at various time points after IV or oral
treatment with vehicle or OMA. For ICV injection, the ICV
cannula was connected to an extension catheter (PP 20) with a
Hamilton syringe. Ang I (100 pmol) was injected ICV in a
volume of 1 μl and flushed with 3 μl of physiological saline.
OMA was injected ICV in volume of 1 to 3 μl (depending on
the dose, see below) and flushed with 3 μl of physiological
saline. Recordings of systolic, diastolic and MAP and HR
were carried out via the arterial catheter using a pressure transducer (Smiths Industries Medical System Company, PVB
Medizintechnik GmbH Kirchseeon, Germany) and a Gold
Brush pressure computer coupled to a Gold brush 2400 recorder. Analogue output signals were digitalised and then
processed using a computerised programme (Culman et al.
1997). The changes in MAP in response to IV Ang I are of
short duration (2 min) and are expressed as maximal increases
(ΔMAP; mmHg). The pressor response to ICVAng I lasts for
about 25 min, and is, therefore, expressed as the maximal
increase in MAP and also as area under the curve (AUC;
MAP, mmHg×min). The AUC value represents the sum of
MAP changes integrated in time, i.e. one number quantitatively characterises the whole response.
The arterial catheter was also used for blood withdrawals
(200 μl each) to determine the following blood variables: pH,
pCO2, pO2, concentrations of glucose, lactate, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, hydrogen carbonate and hematocrite,
before and during MCAO and reperfusion (RADIOMETER
ABL 700 SERIES (Radiometer Medical A/S, DK-2700
Brønshøj, Denmark)).
Neurological deficits
The used neurological grading system used in the current experiments allows a separate assessment of motor and sensory
functions (Garcia et al. 1995). Severe impairments in each test
are graded 0 or 1, and no observable deficits are graded 3. The

941

neurobehavioural evaluation consisted of the following five
tests and scoring: (1) symmetry of the movement of four
limbs, (2) forepaw outstretching, (3) climbing, (4) body proprioception and (5) response to vibrissae touch.
Measurement of infarction volume
Twenty-four hour after MCAO, rats were deeply anaesthetised
and intracardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS; pH 7.4) followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde. The brains
were removed, post-fixed overnight and subsequently
cryoprotected in 30 % sucrose for 72 h at 4 °C. Coronal sections (40 μm) were cut in a cryostat from the level bregma +
4.0 mm to the level bregma −7.0 mm. Every 20th slice was
used for the determination of the infarction size. Fifteen equidistant coronal sections (40 μm) were stained with cresyl violet, and the infarction volume was calculated by multiplying
the sum of the areas by the distance between the sections.
Chemicals
Angiotensin I (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) for IV injection was dissolved in physiological saline (stock solution,
500 nmol/l) stored by −20 °C and appropriately diluted before
each experiment. Ang I was injected IV as a bolus at dose of
50 pmol in 100 μl/kg body weight. Ang I for ICV injections
(100 pmol/μl) also dissolved in physiological saline. In previous experiments, Ang I dissolved either in physiological saline or artificial cerebrospinal fluid had yielded identical results. OMA ([4S-[4(R*),7,10a]]-octahydro-4-[(2-mercapto-1oxo-3-phenylpropyl)amino]-5-oxo-7H-pyrido[2,1-b] [1,3]thiazepine-7-carboxylic acid) was provided by BristolMyers-Squibb, Princetown, NJ, USA. OMA is almost insoluble in water (0.04 mg/ml at room temperature); however, the
solubility of the inhibitor in aqueous solution increases as the
pH of the medium increases (due to the ionisation of the carboxylic acid group and the sulfhydryl group). Therefore,
OMA for oral application was dissolved in water by
neutralisation with a stoichiometric equivalent of NAOH.
For ICV administration, OMA was solubilised in saline and
NaOH solution was added to obtain a clear solution. The final
pH of the OMA solution was 8.0–8.2, solutions of higher pH
values may exert harmful effects when injected ICV. The
doses of 30 (100) nmol and 10 nmol of OMA were injected
ICV in a volume of 3 and 2 μl, respectively, the dose of 3 nmol
was injected in 1 μl. The pH value of the vehicle solution was
adjusted to 8.0. The osmotic minipumps delivering solutions
at a rate of 0.5 μl/h were filled with OMA at a concentration of 6 mmol/l (pH=8.0), i.e. OMA was infused
ICV at the dose of 3 nmol/h. Solubility limits have
prevented the use of higher doses of OMA in stroke
experiments. All other chemical were purchased from
Sigma, Deisenhofen or Merck, Darmstadt, Germany.

Effect of IV treatment with OMA on pressor responses induced
by IV and ICV Ang I

Experimental protocols
Effects of ICV treatment with OMA on pressor responses
induced by ICV and IV Ang I
Initially, the effects of ICV administered vehicle or OMA on
baseline MAP and HR were determined (n=7/group). Rats
treated ICV with 100 nmol OMA, displayed rotation along
the long axis (barrel rotation), motor disturbances and seizures
and considerable increases in MAP and HR (Table 1).
Therefore, this dose was not used in further experiments. In
the following experiments, rats (n=6–8) were treated ICV
with vehicle (controls) or with OMA (3, 10, 30 nmol). The
pressor responses to Ang I injected ICV were recorded before
and then 15 min, 1, 4 and 24 h post-treatment. MAP increases
to Ang I (50 pmol/kg body weight) injected IV at the same
time points were also recorded to assess the leakage of ICVinjected OMA into the systemic circulation.

Effect of oral treatment with OMA on pressor responses
induced by IV and ICV Ang I
Rats were treated orally with vehicle (controls, n=7) or with
OMA (n=7–8/group) at doses of 5, 25, 100 μmol/kg body
weight. Ang I (50 pmol/kg body weight) was injected IV
before and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h after the treatment and the
pressor responses were recorded. In the second set of experiments, rats (n=7–8) were treated orally with the same doses of
OMA or with vehicle (controls). The blood pressure responses
to ICVAng I were detected before and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h posttreatment.

with all groups injected with lower doses of OMA, calculated with oneway ANOVA followed by the post hoc Bonferroni adjustment

The data obtained in the first experimental setting has revealed
that OMA given orally even at the highest dose does not cross
the BBB. To achieve a rapid, high initial increase in OMA
concentration in the systemic circulation, the inhibitor (n=6–
8/group) was injected IV at doses of 0.5, 1, 5, 25 μmol/kg
body weight. Controls (n=7) received vehicle. The blood
pressure responses to IV injected Ang I were recorded before
and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h post-treatment. The effect of
100 μmol/kg body weight OMA on the pressor response to IV
Ang I was tested at 8 and 24 h after the IV injection. In the
second set of experiments, rats (n=7–8) were treated IV with
vehicle or OMA (0.5, 1, 5, 25 μmol/kg body weight) and the
blood pressure responses to Ang I injected ICV were recorded
prior and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h post-treatment. We have observed
that the pressor response to the second ICV Ang I injection
was significantly smaller than that to the preceding one (due to
desensitisation of angiotensin AT1 receptors) when the time
interval between the two consecutive ICV Ang I injections
was 30 min or shorter. In a separate experiment, Ang I was
injected ICV 30 min (0.5 h) after IV treatment with vehicle or
various doses of OMA (n=6–7). To ascertain the effects of IVinjected OMA on resting values of blood pressure and heart
rate, 100 μmol/kg body weight of OMA was slowly injected
IV and the MAP, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and HR
were monitored over 120 min (vehicle, n=7; OMA, n=8).
Effects of ICV treatment with OMA on neurological outcome
and infarction volume after focal cerebral ischaemia
Osmotic minipumps filled with vehicle or OMA (6 mmol/l)
were randomly implanted 5 days before MCAO by laboratory
technicians (J.B. or B.S.). The induction of the focal cerebral
ischaemia (MCAO for 90 min) was carried out by the same
person, who was blinded to the treatments (W.S.). rCBF was
monitored continuously before and during MCAO in each rat.
Only rats, in which the ipsilateral rCBF was continuously
reduced to less than 25 % of the baseline at least 30 min after
the onset of MCAO were included into the protocol. ICV
infusions of vehicle and OMA were then continued for 24 h.
Neurological evaluations were carried out 24 h after MCAO in
each rat by the same investigator (J.C.), who was not involved
in surgery and was blinded to treatment protocols. The brains
for the determination of the infarction volume were obtained
from rats intracardially perfused 24 h after MCAO (vehicle,
n=11; OMA, n=10). The brains were cut in a cryostat and
stained with cresyl violet (W.S.). The infarction volume was
evaluated by an investigator, who was blinded to the treatment
protocols (Y.Z.).
A separate experiment was designed to monitor systolic
and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate and to determine

Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol (2015) 388:939–951

physiological variables before, during and after focal cerebral
ischaemia in rats infused ICV with vehicle or OMA 5 days
prior to MCAO. On the day of experiment, baseline cardiovascular parameters were recorded (vehicle, n=10; OMA, n=
10) and the basal blood sample (200 μl) was collected for
determination of physiological variables (vehicle, n = 8;
OMA, n=10), in conscious rats. The cardiovascular parameters were continuously monitored before, during and up to
150 min after the onset of cerebral ischaemia and then 24 h
after the ischaemic insult. Blood samples were withdrawn
immediately before the surgery, 60 and 120 min after the
MCAO and 30 min after the onset of the reperfusion period.
In a separate experiment, the pressor response to Ang I
(50 pmol/kg body weight) injected IV was detected on day 5
after continuous ICV infusion of vehicle (n=7) or OMA
(6 mmol/l; n=6) to ascertain the leakage of OMA from the
ventricular system into the systemic circulation.
Mortality Three rats treated with vehicle and 3 rats treated
with OMA died within 24 h after MCAO.
Statistics
Results are expressed as the mean±SEM. The effects of OMA
administered ICV, orally or IVon the MAP increases (ΔMAP)
to IV and ICV Ang I, the monitoring of MAP, systolic and
diastolic blood pressure and HR, the monitoring of rCBF
and data on determination of physiological variables in blood
were statistically analysed by two-factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures. AUC data were
analysed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni
adjustment for pairwise comparisons. Statistical significance
of differences in neurological deficits between vehicle- and
OMA-treated rats exposed to MCAO did not follow the normal, Gaussian distribution (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and
were, therefore, analysed by the non-parametric Mann–
Whitney test. The effects of vehicle or OMA on the infarction
size were analysed by the Student’s t test for unpaired samples
(normal, Gaussian distribution). The Bartlett’s test suggested
that the differences among the SDs were not significant. A
sample size of 10 in each group will have 80 % power to
detect an effect size of 1325 using a two group t test with a
0.050 two-sided significance level.

Results
General remarks
Ang I injected IV or ICV is immediately converted to Ang II,
which increases MAP by activating peripheral or brain AT1
receptors. The pressor responses elicited by equimolar doses
of Ang I and Ang II injected IV or ICV are identical. Ang I

943

injected IV induces a short-lasting (2–3 min) increase in MAP,
which then rapidly returns to basal value. Changes in HR were
small and variable and there were no differences between the
vehicle- and OMA-treated groups of rats. The pressor response to ICV Ang I is characterised by a rapid increase in
MAP which reaches maximum at 1–2 min and then returns
gradually to basal values. The majority of animals reach control, pre-injection values within 25–30 min after Ang I injection. Intravenous or ICV injection of Ang I to conscious rats
resulted in highly reproducible pressor responses throughout
the protocols.
Effects of ICV treatment with OMA on pressor responses
induced by ICV and IV Ang I
Acute ICV administration of OMA at doses of 3, 10 and
30 nmol had no effect on resting MAP and HR (Table 1).
However, the dose of 100 nmol OMA considerably increased
MAP and HR along with barrel rotation and motor disturbances. ICV injections of Ang I resulted in a highly reproducible increases in the MAP of about 20–25 mmHg. The dose of
3 nmol OMA inhibited the Ang I response only 15 min following the treatment. In rats treated with 10 and 30 nmol of
OMA, the pressor response to Ang I (expressed either as a
maximum in MAP increase or as AUC) was attenuated up to
1 h after the inhibitor administration but not at later time points
(Fig. 1a, b). OMA injected ICV rapidly appeared in the systemic circulation and dose-dependently attenuated the blood
pressure responses to IVAng I. The systemic inhibitory effects
of OMA at doses of 10 and 30 nmol were detectable over a 4-h
period post-ICV inhibitor administration (Fig. 1c).
Effect of oral treatment with OMA on pressor responses
induced by IV and ICV Ang I
Ang I (50 pmol/kg body weight) injected IV in rats treated
with vehicle elicited consistent increases in the MAP. All
doses of OMA administered orally completely abolished the
pressor response to IVAng I up to 4 h. The pressor response to
IVAng I was significantly attenuated at 8 h and the inhibitory
effects were still detectable 24 h after the treatment; the dose
of 5 μmol/kg body weight OMA was less effective than the
higher doses of the inhibitor (Fig. 2a). OMA administered
orally at either dose had not any effect on the pressor response
to ICV Ang I at any time point (Fig. 2b, c, only effects of 25
and 100 μmol/kg body weight OMA are shown).
Effect of IV treatment with OMA on pressor responses induced
by IV and ICV Ang I
The dose of 100 μmol/kg body weight OMA or vehicle injected
IV induced small immediate increases in MAP and HR which
did not significantly differ (ΔMAP: vehicle, 6±2 mmHg;

slight reduction in infarct volume by approximately 20 %,
detected in rats treated with OMA did not reach statistical
significance (Fig. 5a). Twenty four h after MCAO, the rats
in both groups suffered from severe neurological deficits and
no significant differences in the summation of motor and sensory neurological scores were observed (Fig. 5b). Except of
the symmetry of the movement of four limbs, the individual
scores of sensory impairments and motor deficits of rats treated with OMA did not differ from those recorded in vehicletreated rats (Fig. 5c).

systemically administered OMA across the BBB and the effect of the inhibitor on the recovery from focal cerebral ischaemia. The main findings are that ICV-injected OMA rapidly
appears in the systemic circulation and more effectively inhibits the systemic than the central pressor responses to Ang I,
secondly, systemically administered OMA does not diffuse
into the brain ventricles and brain tissue and thirdly, central
treatment with OMA does not affect the recovery from focal
cerebral ischaemia. To our best knowledge, this is the first
study reporting on effects of a simultaneous ACE/NEP inhibition in the brain on the outcome after ischaemic stroke.
ICV injection of OMA dose-dependently attenuated the
increases in arterial blood pressure induced by centrally
(ICV) applied Ang I. Ang I injected ICV is rapidly converted
to Ang II by ACE in the CVOs which exhibit high activities of
ACE (Saavedra and Chevillard 1982). The cardiovascular response to Ang II is mediated by the release of vasopressin
from the posterior pituitary, activation of the sympathetic

nervous system and inhibition of the baroreflex (Haack and
Möhring 1978; Hogarty et al. 1992). The pressor response is
generated by activation of AT1 receptors in the CVOs, the
subfornical organ (SFO) and the organum vasculosim laminae
terminals (OVLT), which lack of the BBB, and the neuronal
circuits in the lamina terminalis, a strip of periventricular tissue comprising the anterior wall of the 3rd ventricle (AV3V)
(Chai et al. 1987; Mendelsohn et al. 1984). A substantial network of fibres containing Ang II connects the neurones in the
CVOs directly or indirectly, via a synaptic relay in the median
preoptic nucleus (MnPO), with the vasopressin-secreting neurons in the paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei (Honda et al. 1990; Oldfield et al. 1991; Bains et al. 1992).
At early time points after ICV OMA injection, the attenuation
of the pressor response to ICV Ang I most probably resulted
from a direct inhibition of ACE in the CVOs and consequently
reduced conversion of Ang I to Ang II.
Where the CSF interfaces the ependymal cells, the gap
junctions provide only limited diffusion restrictions. The lack
of the structural barrier enables free exchange of substances
between the CSF and interstitial fluid (Johanson et al. 2011;
Zheng and Monnot 2012). Providing that OMA injected ICV

efficiently diffused from the ventricular system into the adjacent neural tissue, inhibition of ACE would impair the synthesis of Ang II in angiotensin nerve terminals, especially in
those localised in the PVN and MnPO, which lie in the close
vicinity of the ventricular system. The impaired Ang II synthesis would then result in reduced pressor responses induced
by Ang I at later time points. As no reductions in the pressor
responses to Ang I were observed, we assume that OMA
administered ICVas a single injection rapidly disappears from
the ventricular system through the CSF drainage and appears
in the circulation (Murtha et al. 2014). The attenuation of the
pressor response to Ang I injected IV observed as early as 1 h
after ICV OMA application is consistent with this assumption.
It should be emphasised that OMA applied ICV inhibited
more effectively and for a longer period of time the systemic
than the central pressor responses to Ang I.
In the next series of experiments, we studied the penetration of OMA across the BBB and its appearance in the CSF
after systemic treatment. As expected, a single dose of OMA
administered IVor orally time and dose dependently inhibited
the pressor response elicited by IV Ang I. In fact, the cardiovascular response to Ang I was almost completely abolished

The following tests were evaluated: (1) symmetry of the movement of

neurological outcome received higher neurological scores. Statistical
comparisons with the vehicle-treated group: *P<0.05, calculated by the
Mann–Whitney test

30–60 min after IV and 1–4 h after oral treatment with the
inhibitor. However, OMA administered systemically did not
alter the cardiovascular effects of Ang I injected ICV. Even
high initial concentrations of OMA in the circulation achieved
by IV application of the inhibitor were without any effects.
The sensory CVOs, the SFO and the OVLT which are the sites
of the conversion of ICV-injected Ang I to Ang II, lack of the
BBB. The SFO and OVLT consist of two separated compartments, the hemal milieu and the CSF-dominated milieu. Tight
junctions between tanycytic endings and glial cells prevent a
direct communication between these two compartments
(Krisch et al. 1978, 1987). Although both CVOs exhibit high
activities of ACE, the exact localisation of the enzyme within
these compartments has not yet been reported (Saavedra and
Chevillard 1982). Nevertheless, our data clearly demonstrates
that OMA in systemic circulation has obviously no access to
ACE in these CVOs.
While the transport of substances across the BBB is strictly
limited through the inter- endothelial tight junctions and the
underlying basement membrane, the metabolic barrier and
transport systems (Persidsky et al. 2006; Engelhardt and

Sorokin 2009), the blood-cerebrospinal barrier (BCSFB) is
merely formed by tight junctions between epithelial cells
(Speake et al. 2001; Johanson et al. 2011). BCSFB allows
the passage of small molecules, e.g. peptides and hormones,
and low molecular mass substances. OMA circulating in the
blood may, therefore be secreted from the circulation into the
brain ventricles during the production of CSF in the choroid
plexuses. Our findings do not support this assumption, as
systemic treatment with OMA did not impair the conversion
of ICV injected Ang I to Ang II. The present data together with
previous findings (Kubota et al. 2003) provide strong evidence that the BCSFB and the BBB prevent, or, at least to a
great extent, limit the penetration of OMA into the brain
tissue.
The restricted transfer of OMA between the blood and
brain must be reconciled with the multiple functions of different brain peptides processed by the ACE and NEP, of which
each subserves distinct central functions. Ang I/II, bradykinin,
substance P (SP) amyloid-β peptide are closely involved in a
wide variety of pathological processes in the brain, like postischaemic inflammation, neurodegeneration and apoptosis.
Very recently, Rashid et al. (2014) reported on a sustained
upregulation of the membrane-bound endopeptidase,
neurolysin (EC3.4.24.16), in different parts of the mouse brain
up to 7 days after MCAO with reperfusion. To explore the role
of the brain ACE and NEP in the modulation of processes
linked to cerebral ischaemia and stroke outcome, we investigated the effects of ACE/NEP inhibition in the brain upon
neurologic outcome and infarction volume after MCAO with
reperfusion. A single ICV injection of OMA effectively
inhibited ACE only for a short period of time. To achieve an
effective and steady-state inhibition of ACE and NEP, OMA
was continuously infused ICV over a 5-day period before and
during 24 h after MCAO. We assume that ICV-infused OMA
diffused into the brain interstitial fluid, as (i) a constant concentration of the inhibitor was permanently present in the ventricular system before MCAO, (ii) the lack of a structural
barrier between the CSF and the interstitial fluid enables the
diffusion of OMA into the brain parenchyma and (iii) disruption of the BBB and other barrier systems, which occurs early
after ischaemia/hypoxia, may further facilitate the entry of
OMA into the interstitial fluid (Johanson et al. 2011; Zheng
and Monnot 2012; Rosenberg 2012). We have convincingly
demonstrated that long-term ICV infusion of the same dose of
pioglitazone, which does not cross the BBB, effectively ameliorated neuronal injury also in brain areas not localised in the
close vicinity to the ventricular system (Zhao et al. 2006;
Zuhayra et al. 2011).
ICV OMA did not alter MAP, HR and physiological variables compared with vehicle-treated rats at any time point
during MCAO and reperfusion. As ischaemic stroke impairs
the central cardiovascular regulation, blood pressure lowering
during and after cerebral ischaemia results in a reduction of

950

cerebral blood flow to the ischaemic area and, consequently,
increases infarction volume. The ACE/NEP inhibition did not
alter the recovery from ischaemic stroke. The lack of neuroprotection may, on one side, be due to the fact that the used
dose of OMA, 3 nmol/h, failed to completely inhibit ACE/
NEP in the brain. The poor solubility of OMA in aqueous
solutions did not allow the usage of higher doses of the inhibitor. Providing, that sufficient amounts of OMA reached ischaemic brain regions, inhibition of ACE/NEP impaired processing of a variety of peptides exerting diverse actions in
different types of cells, including neurones, localised in ischaemic tissue. For instance, decrease in Ang II concentration
and angiotensin AT1 activation may, on one side, alleviate
neuronal deficits, reduce neuronal injury due to weakening
post-ischaemic inflammation and neuronal cell damage and
improve the recovery from ischaemic stroke (Lou et al.
2004). On the other side, diminished angiotensin AT2 receptor
signalling may negatively influence neuronal regeneration
and neuronal survival and increase the severity of ischaemic
damage (Li et al. 2005; Min et al. 2014). Inhibiting of ACE/
NEP increases BK and SP which initiate and regulate a number of pathological processes linked to cerebral ischaemia. BK
is an important mediator of inflammatory reactions after ischaemic stroke, including arteriolar dilatation and increased vascular permeability, which considerably contribute to the development of oedema in ischaemic brain. Bradykinin is increasingly produced and released in ischaemic brain parenchyma and, acting at bradykinin B2 receptors, it promotes
neuronal cell death, neutrophil accumulation and oedema formation after ischaemic stroke (Sobey 2003; Ding-Zhou et al.
2003; Gröger et al. 2005; and the references therein). Higher
levels of SP also activate neurogenic inflammation and the
development of cerebral oedema. Tachykinin receptor antagonists efficiently reduced the BBB opening, cerebral oedema,
infarction volume and improved neurological function (Yu
et al. 1997; Turner et al. 2011). Considering the great number
of diverse and opposing actions mediated by peptides
metabolised by ACE and NEP in ischaemic brain, it is not
very surprising that treatment with OMA did not exert any
beneficial or deleterious effects upon neurological outcome
and ischaemic injury after focal cerebral ischaemia.
Our findings also address an important issue about the use
of OMA in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and
neurological diseases. Brain RAS hyperactivity has been implicated in the development and maintenance of hypertension.
As OMA does not pass the BBB, the potent and sustained
antihypertensive effects of the systemically administered inhibitor are primarily mediated by vascular mechanisms.
Treatment of hypertension may also reduce the likelihood
and slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The inability
of OMA to penetrate through the BBB is advantageous as
inhibition of brain ACE and NEP may also increase accumulation of amyloid-β peptides (Iwata et al. 2005). Novel ACE/

NEP inhibitors, such Ileparil, angiotensin-AT1 receptor/NEP
inhibitors and triple-acting NEP inhibitors (ACE/NEP/
endothelin-converting enzyme inhibitors) have been developed and are undergoing clinical evaluation (von Lueder
et al. 2014). These novel inhibitors may interfere with the
synthesis, degradation or receptor binding of a number of
neuropeptides in the brain controlling a wide range of brain
functions. Key questions, which need to be answered in future
studies, are, whether and to which extent these antagonists
penetrate into the brain after systemic treatment and inhibit
AT1 receptors and ACE or NEP, and which are the functional
consequences of a long-term alteration in the concentrations
and binding of these peptides in brain tissue under pathological conditions.
