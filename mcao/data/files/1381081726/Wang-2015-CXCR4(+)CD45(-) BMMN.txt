Cell-based therapy is considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke treatment. Although
unfractionated bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) have been tried in both preclinical and clinical trials, the effective subpopulations need to be identiﬁed. In this study, we used ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting to harvest the CXCR4+CD45+ and CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC subpopulations from
transgenic mice that express enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein. We then allogeneically grafted unfractionated BMMNCs or a subpopulation into mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO) and compared the effects on stroke outcomes. We found that CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs, but
not CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs, more effectively reduced infarction volume and neurologic deﬁcits than
did unfractionated BMMNCs. Brain tissue from the ischemic hemisphere of mice treated with CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs had higher levels of vascular endothelial growth factor and lower levels of TNF-a than
did tissue from mice treated with unfractionated BMMNCs. In contrast, CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs showed
an increase in TNF-a. Additionally, CXCR4+CD45+ and CXCR4+CD45 populations exhibited more robust
migration into the lesion areas and were better able to express cell-speciﬁc markers of different linages
than were the unfractionated BMMNCs. Endothelial and astrocyte cell markers did not colocalize with
eGFP+ cells in the brains of tMCAO mice that received CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs. In vitro, the CXCR4+CD45
BMMNCs expressed signiﬁcantly more Oct-4 and Nanog mRNA than did the unfractionated BMMNCs.
However, we did not detect gene expression of these two pluripotent markers in CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs.
Taken together, our study shows for the ﬁrst time that the CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC subpopulation is superior to unfractionated BMMNCs in ameliorating cerebral damage in a mouse model of tMCAO and could
represent a new therapeutic approach for stroke treatment.

mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) have attracted the interest of many
researchers because their use avoids ethical concerns, and they
are easy to obtain and purify. They can be harvested allogeneically
or autologously from bone marrow within hours, no cell culture
procedures are needed, and they can be administered immediately
into the recipient through various routes. Over the past decade,
evidence from preclinical studies has shown that grafting BMMNCs
after cerebral ischemia provides substantial therapeutic effects
(Boltze et al., 2011; Fujita et al., 2010; Hess and Hill, 2011;
Mendez-Otero et al., 2007; Prasad et al., 2012). Despite progress
in this ﬁeld, the detailed mechanism through which BMMNCs exert
their protective effects in cerebral ischemia remains elusive.
BMMNCs harbor a heterogeneous population that contains
mature and immature cells in the myeloid and lymphoid lineages,
such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells

J. Wang et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 45 (2015) 98–108

(HSCs), and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) (Arnous et al., 2012;
Civin and Gore, 1993; Crosby et al., 2000; Dominici et al., 2006;
Savitz, 2013). In reality, BMMNCs harvested from bone marrow
by density centrifugation contain very few stem cells (2% to 4%
HSCs/EPCs and 0.01% MSCs) (Malliaras and Marban, 2011). Bone
marrow-derived stromal cells, or MSCs, are currently a promising
cell source in stroke therapy. MSCs are capable of self-renewal
and can differentiate into various cell linages, including cartilage,
bone, adipose, hepatocytes, and neurons (Duenas et al., 2014;
Pittenger et al., 1999; Prockop, 1997). It has been reported that
human MSCs can migrate into the rat brain and acquire a neuronal
phenotype in vivo (Azizi et al., 1998). More importantly, MSCs
function as a ‘‘cytokine and trophic factors factory’’ that supports
other cell types (Caplan and Dennis, 2006). Despite the advantages
of MSCs, obtaining sufﬁcient quantities requires cell culture. Therefore, autologous MSCs cannot be obtained in the acute stage after
stroke, limiting their application.
Most investigators who have studied the use of cell transplantation for cerebral ischemia have used mixed BMMNCs. However, the
migration and beneﬁcial effects of BMMNCs require the cell surface
expression of CXCR4. Many studies have documented that
BMMNCs expressing this marker undergo rapid mobilization during cerebral ischemia in response to the chemokine gradient
formed by stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), which is secreted
in the ischemic penumbra, especially by astrocytes and endothelial
cells (Hill et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2012). Compared with CXCR4
BMMNCs, CXCR4+ BMMNCs exhibit greater migratory capacity and
are more effective at improving neovascularization, releasing trophic factors, and facilitating tissue repair after acute ischemia
(Seeger et al., 2009). In addition, the tissue-committed stem cell
(TCSC), a population of non-adherent CXCR4+ cells, express mRNA
for various markers of progenitor cells and can circulate into
peripheral tissues, where they contribute to regeneration after tissue damage (Kucia et al., 2005, 2007; Ratajczak et al., 2004, 2007).
It has been reported that hypoxia upregulates the expression of
CXCR4 in ischemic regions (Tang et al., 2009). In addition, CXCR4
knockout donor cells have signiﬁcantly less survival potential than
do wild-type donor cells in the recipient brain (Shichinohe et al.,
2007). These ﬁndings suggest that the optimum cells for stroke
therapy should be CXCR4+.
The vast majority of BMMNC populations contain committed
HSCs, which maintain all blood lineages, including erythrocytes,
platelets, monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes (Civin and
Gore, 1993). HSCs have been shown to mobilize from bone marrow
to peripheral blood circulation during stroke, and the concentration of HSCs in blood correlates with neurofunctional improvements in patients after stroke (Taguchi et al., 2009). It has been
reported that allogeneic grafting of HSCs reduced post-ischemic
inﬂammation and improved outcome in a mouse stroke model
(Schwarting et al., 2008). Furthermore, HSCs were shown to transdifferentiate across tissue-lineage boundaries into various terminal
cell types, including non-HSC (Jang et al., 2004; Krause et al., 2001;
Orlic et al., 2003), microglia, and macroglia cells (Eglitis and Mezey,
1997). However, the transdifferentiation of HSCs has been debated
vigorously (Fukuda and Fujita, 2005; Murry et al., 2004; Wagers
et al., 2002). Possible explanations, such as cell fusion (Terada
et al., 2002; Ying et al., 2002) and epigenetic changes in recipient
tissues (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch, 2003; Jaenisch, 2002), are not
fully able to explain the mechanisms of HSC transdifferentiation.
It has been reported that the CXCR4 receptor is widely expressed
on both HSCs and TCSCs. CD45, a cell surface marker uniquely
expressed on HSCs (Thomas, 1989), can be used to separate CXCR4+
BMMNCs into a CXCR4+CD45+ subpopulation enriched in HSCs and
a CXCR4+CD45 subpopulation highly enriched in non-hematopoietic TCSCs (Kucia et al., 2005). To the best of our knowledge, no

99

report has described the effects of CXCR4+CD45+ and CXCR4+CD45
BMMNCs on outcome of ischemic stroke.
In this study, we examined whether one subpopulation of
BMMNCs provides better protection after ischemic stroke than
unfractionated BMMNCs. We found that CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs
are superior to both CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs and unfractionated
BMMNCs for improving stroke outcomes.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and
experimental groups
All studies were carried out in accordance with the guidelines
for animal research and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at Zhengzhou University. All efforts were made
to minimize animal suffering and reduce the number of animals
used. Adult male C57BL/6J mice (stock number, J000664; weight,
25–30 g; 10–12 weeks old; Animal Center of Nanjing University
School of Medicine, Nanjing, China) were housed at room temperature with a 12-h light/dark cycle in a pathogen-free environment
and were given free access to food and water throughout the study.
One technician performed all surgical procedures and was blinded
to animal group assignment. Cerebral infarction was induced by
tMCAO as previously described with slight modiﬁcations (Longa
et al., 1989). Brieﬂy, anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% halothane in air and was delivered via a snout mask. Body temperature
was maintained at 37 °C throughout the surgical procedure with a
heating pad. The right common carotid artery, external carotid
artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed
through a ventral midline incision. A round-tip, silicone-coated
6-0 nylon ﬁlament was gently inserted into the lumen of the ICA
to the opening of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The length of
the ﬁlament was approximately 12 ± 2 mm and determined
according to the weight of each mouse. Successful MCAO was
deﬁned as a decrease in cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) of more than
80% compared with that of the contralateral hemisphere, as measured by laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry (Moor Instruments, Devon,
UK). For the sham operation, mice underwent the same procedure,
with the only difference being that the ﬁlaments did not occlude
the MCA and were withdrawn from the ICA immediately. After
90 min of MCAO, the ﬁlaments were withdrawn into the stump
of the ECA to initiate blood ﬂow reperfusion. After surgery, an
investigator blinded to group assignment allocated the tMCAO animals into one of four treatment groups: vehicle, unfractionated
BMMNCs, CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs, and CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs.
The sham-operated animals received the same allocation and
treatments.
2.2. Donor BMMNC isolation
Pathogen-free eGFP transgenic mice (C57BL/6J-Tg (CAG-eGFP);
5–6 weeks old, purchased from Nanjing Biomedical Research Institute of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China) were used as cell
donors. This mouse strain carries an eGFP-expressing gene controlled by chicken b-actin promoter in all tissues. The mice were
euthanized by CO2 inhalation, and bone marrow was ﬂushed from
medullary cavities of the humeri, femora, and tibiae. After the bone
marrow was subjected to 1.084 g/mL Ficoll-Paque PREMIUM (GE
Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden) density centrifugation,
the buffy coat layer was aspirated and resuspended in 100 mM
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH7.4). The viability of the isolated BMMNCs was assessed by trypan blue (Sigma–Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) resistance staining. Approximately 1.2  108

100

unfractionated BMMNCs were obtained per eGFP transgenic
mouse. The harvested BMMNCs from each donor were pooled
together for the following experiments.
2.3. SDF-1–induced BMMNC migration assay
We performed the transwell migration assay to preclude the
possibility that the antibody used in FACS may hinder the binding
between SDF-1 and its receptor CXCR4 (Seeger et al., 2009). Brieﬂy,
1  106 freshly isolated BMMNCs and BMMNCs incubated with PEconjugated rat anti-mouse CXCR4 antibody (clone: 2B11, BD
PharMingen, San Diego, CA, USA) at 4 °C for 1 h were resuspended
in 250 lL X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) and
seeded in the upper chambers (8-lm pore size, Millipore). The
chambers were placed in a 24-well cell culture plate with 500 lL
X-VIVO 15 medium. Recombinant mouse SDF-1b (Sigma–Aldrich)
was added into the lower chamber at a ﬁnal concentration of
100 ng/mL. The cells were placed at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator
for 24 h. Cells that migrated to the lower chamber were counted.
Experiments were replicated in triplicate, and the average number
was recorded per mouse.
2.4. BMMNC subpopulation isolation and purity identiﬁcation
The Beckman MoFlo Astrios high-performance, live-cell sorting
system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) was used to isolate the
subpopulations of BMMNCs. After being ﬁltered through a 500mesh nylon screener, BMMNCs (1  108 cells/mL) were incubated
with saturating concentrations of antibodies in PBS supplemented
with 5% bovine serum albumin on ice for 45 min. We used the following antibodies: PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse CXCR4 (clone
2B11, BD PharMingen) and APC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45
(clone: 30-F11, BD PharMingen). Samples also were incubated in
corresponding isotype controls as PE- or APC-conjugated rat IgG2b,
j. After two washes with PBS, the BMMNCs were resuspended in
cell-sorting medium at a concentration of 1  107 cells/mL. We
used a slow sorting strategy to guarantee the accuracy of the target
cell populations. The sorted fractions were immediately analyzed
by the same gating strategy for purity check; approximately
2000 events were acquired for the purity check. The whole sorting
procedure was accomplished within 3 h.
2.5. Cell administration
Cells harvested by FACS were immediately administered to the
recipient mice. We used the intravenous route because it does not
differ signiﬁcantly from intra-arterial delivery (Yang et al., 2013),
and it appears to be more effective than local delivery for longterm protection (Willing et al., 2003). The harvested cells were
washed, resuspended in 300 lL of PBS, and delivered via tail vein
injection 24 h after tMCAO at a dosage of 3  107 cells/kg (Savitz,
2013; Yang et al., 2013, 2011). Sham-operated mice received the
same cell dosage, and the vehicle-treated group received an equal
volume of PBS.
2.6. Infarction volume determination
Infarction volume was determined on day 7 after the tMCAO.
After each mouse was euthanized, the brain was carefully
removed, placed in a mouse brain matrix slicer (Stoelting Instruments, Wood Dale, IL, USA), and coronally sectioned into ﬁve 2mm-thick slices from the frontal pole to the cerebellum. The brain
slices were quickly immersed into 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC; Sigma–Aldrich) for 30 min at 37 °C and ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight. We measured the area of damaged parenchyma (unstained tissue) on the posterior surface of

each slice using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Total
infarct volumes were determined as described previously (Jiang
et al., 2013). Brieﬂy, in each brain slice, infarcted area was measured by subtracting the intact area of the ipsilateral hemisphere
from the total area of the contralateral hemisphere to correct for
brain swelling. Total infarct volume was calculated by linear integration of the corrected lesion areas. The infarct volume percentage was calculated by the equation: total infarct volume/
contralateral hemispheric volume  100%.
2.7. Neurologic function analysis
A battery of neurologic function tests was performed on days 1,
7, and 14 after tMCAO (n = 12 mice/group). An investigator blinded
to treatment group used the modiﬁed neurologic severity score
(mNSS) to evaluate functional outcome according to previously
published data (Chen et al., 2005; Cui et al., 2013; Schaar et al.,
2010). The battery included tests of neurologic motor function,
gait, balance, and reﬂex. For the motor function tests, mice were
held up by their tails so that they could move freely. We recorded
ﬂexion of the four limbs and head movements in the vertical axis
within 30 s. Gait was analyzed by placing the mice on a ﬂat surface
and observing the walk; inability to walk straight, circling or falling
down to the paretic side was recorded. Balance function was tested
by placing the mice on a round slim beam, recording whether they
could grasp or hug the beam, counting the number of limbs that
fell from the beam, and recording the time until they fell from
the beam. For the reﬂex tests, a head shake when the auditory
meatus was touched indicated a positive pinna reﬂex, and an eye
blink when the cornea was touched lightly with cotton indicated
a positive corneal reﬂex. The score was graded on a scale from 0
to 14 (where 0 represents normal and 14 represents maximal deficit). Each evaluation was performed in triplicate, and a mean score
was recorded.
2.8. Western blot analysis
We used Western blot analysis to examine the expression levels
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and TNF-a in brain on
day 3 after cell transplantation (n = 6 mice/group). Brain tissue
from the infarcted hemisphere was removed and homogenized in
RIPA-Doc buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X100, 1% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS, supplemented with protease
inhibitors). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford
protein assay. Equal amounts of total protein were separated on
10–12% glycine gel and transferred onto polyvinylidenediﬂuoride
membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk
in PBS with Tween-20 (PBST) and incubated with rabbit anti-VEGF
polyclonal antibody (1:200 dilution) or rabbit anti-TNF-a polyclonal antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX,
USA) at 4 °C overnight. b-actin expression was detected by its antibody AC-15 (1:10,000, Sigma–Aldrich) and served as an internal
control. After being washed in PBST, the membranes were incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h and then reacted
with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL,
USA). The results of chemiluminescence were visualized and captured by an imaging system (ClinX Science Instruments, Shanghai,
China). Target protein band intensity was normalized by b-actin
and quantiﬁed by ImageJ software. Independent experiments were
repeated in triplicate.
2.9. Histology and immunoﬂuorescence
We examined the eGFP-positive cells in the brain at various
time points after transplantation. To investigate the plasticity of

J. Wang et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 45 (2015) 98–108

the grafted cells, we allowed the mice to survive until day 21 after
tMCAO or sham operation (6 mice per group). Mice that died
before the designated time were excluded from this experiment.
Mice were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
350 mg/kg chloral hydrate and then perfused transcardially with
PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were
removed, post-ﬁxed in 4% PFA, and dehydrated in PBS containing
various concentrations of sucrose for 24 h at 4 °C before being
embedded in O.C.T. medium (Sakura Finetek, USA). Brains were
then sliced coronally into 15-lm-thick sections at 20 °C on a
cryotome (Leica Instruments, Heidelberg, Baden-Wurttemberg,
Germany). Five consecutive adjacent sections were obtained from
every tenth section cut from the center of the lesion (bregma
1 mm to +1 mm) (Cui et al., 2013). Sections were ﬁxed in cold
methanol for 5 min, incubated in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 for
15 min, and then blocked in 5% BSA solution for 30 min at room
temperature. Finally, they were incubated with primary antibodies
at 4 °C overnight. A chicken anti-GFP antibody (1:1000, Life Technology, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to label the grafted eGFPpositive cells. Glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocytespeciﬁc marker, was detected by rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-GFAP
(1:300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). CD31, an endothelial cell marker, was detected by rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-CD31 (1:100, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). After being washed three times with PBST,
the sections were incubated in Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat
anti-chicken (1:1000, Life Technology) or Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:1000, Life Technology) secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Negative control sections
received the same immunostaining procedures, but the primary
antibodies were omitted. The sections were mounted in mounting
reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with DAPI and visualized on
the AxioScope epiﬂuorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany). Eight ﬁelds per section within the cortex and striatum
from the ischemic boundary zone were used for quantiﬁcation.
All eGFP+ cells in each ﬁeld were counted to obtain the percentage
of grafted cells that colocalized with cell type-speciﬁc markers
(GFAP or CD31).

2.10. Semiquantitative RT-PCR
To investigate the pluripotency in each cell population, we analyzed the gene expression of early embryonic transcription factors
Octamer-4 (Oct-4) and Nanog in different cell populations. Cells
were sorted by ﬂow cytometry, and total RNA was extracted from
cells by using TRI reagent (Sigma–Aldrich). Each cell type was
pooled from ﬁve donor mice. To prevent genomic DNA contamination, we added DNaseI (Life Technology) to the products and conﬁrmed the harvested RNA on an agarose gel. Using equal amounts
of RNA, we synthesized the ﬁrst-strand cDNA with the ThermoScript RT-PCR System (Life Technology) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Life
Technology) was used to amplify the newly synthesized cDNA
templates in a 20-lL reaction. A 160-bp fragment of mouse Oct-4
gene was ampliﬁed with the forward primer: 50 -TAGGTGAGCC
GTCTTTCCAC-30 and reverse primer: 50 -GCTTAGCCA GGTTCGAGGAT-30 . A 106-bp fragment of mouse Nanog gene was ampliﬁed
with the forward primer: 50 -TTGCTTA CAAGGGTCTGCTACT-30 and
reverse primer: 50 -ACTGGTA GAAGAATCAGGGCT-30 . A 123-bp
fragment of the mouse glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was ampliﬁed by forward primer: 50 AGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTG-30 and reverse primer: 50 -TGTAGACCATGTAGTTGAGGTCA-30 . The PCR products were resolved on 1.5–
2.0% agarose gels to conﬁrm that sizes were correct. Images were
captured and analyzed by a Gel Doc EZ gel image analysis system
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

2.11. Statistical analysis
Mice that did not have at least 80% decrease in CBF, had an
mNSS score <5 or >13 points on day 1 after tMCAO, or did not survive for a sufﬁcient time were excluded from the ﬁnal data analysis. All data were expressed as means ± SD. SPSS13.0 software was
used to analyze the data. Parametric tests were used for data that
met assumptions for normality and equal variance. Student’s t-test
was used to analyze differences for two unpaired samples. Oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc analysis
was used for multiple comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
During this study, the mortality was 1.4% (1/72) in the sham
groups, 25.0% (6/24) in the vehicle-treated tMCAO group, 21.7%
(13/60) in the unfractionated BMMNC-treated tMCAO group,
23.3% (14/60) in the CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNC-treated group, and
20.0% (12/60) in the CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC-treated group. In addition, three mice died from the MCAO procedure, and two mice died
from anesthesia.
3.1. CXCR4 antibody can be used for CXCR4+ cell isolation
CXCR4 is a receptor of SDF-1 that is expressed on the surface of
BMMNCs. It is essential for migration of BMMNCs in vivo after
engraftment. To conﬁrm that the antibody used for FACS did not
hinder the functional activity of CXCR4 and CXCR4/SDF-1 binding,
we compared the migration capacity of freshly isolated BMMNCs
and BMMNCs pre-incubated with PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse
CXCR4 antibody (clone: 2B11). After 24 h, migration did not differ
between the two groups (p > 0.05; Supplementary Fig. 1). This
result suggested that the epitope that this antibody recognizes is
not the binding domain of CXCR4; hence, this antibody can be used
in FACS sorting for CXCR4+ cells.
3.2. Purity of CXCR4+CD45+ and CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC
subpopulations
Freshly isolated BMMNCs from eGFP mice were stained for designated antibodies and isotype controls and sorted by FACS. The
four quadrants gated for different BMMNC subpopulations were
set according to the BMMNCs dual-labeled and mono-labeled with
antibodies and/or isotype controls. The initial proportion of
CXCR4+CD45, CXCR4+CD45+, CXCR4CD45, and CXCR4CD45+
populations in the presorted BMMNCs were 1.3 ± 0.5%, 5.8 ± 0.9%,
9.4 ± 1.7%, and 82.2 ± 3.2%, respectively (n = 6 mice). The purity of
the harvested CXCR4+CD45+ cells was 90.5 ± 2.1% and that of the
CXCR4+CD45 cells was 91.2 ± 2.4% (n = 6 mice, Supplementary
Fig. 2).
3.3. CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs reduce infarct volume and
neurobehavioral deﬁcits better than unfractionated BMMNCs
Fig. 1A shows representative TTC staining of brain slices from
sham, vehicle-, and cell-treated tMCAO groups. The corrected
infarction volumes of mice treated with vehicle, unfractionated
BMMNCs, CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs, and CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs
were 70.2 ± 4.6%, 57.5 ± 7.2%, 64.8 ± 7.8%, and 45.2 ± 4.7%, respectively (n = 6/group, Fig. 1B). Consistent with previously published
data (Jiang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013), BMMNC treatment
reduced the infarction volume compared with vehicle treatment
(F = 18.21, p = 0.002). Moreover, the infarction volume of mice
treated with CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs was smaller than that of mice

tMCAO illustrates the infarction volume in mice treated with different cell populations; areas of infarct are white. (B) Corrected infarction volume was calculated as a
percentage of the contralateral area. The infarction volume of the CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC-treated group was signiﬁcantly less than that of the unfractionated BMMNC-treated
group. n = 6 mice/group; ⁄⁄p < 0.01 vs. vehicle; ##p < 0.01 vs. unfractionated BMMNCs; one-way ANOVA followed by LSD analysis. (C) Modiﬁed neurologic severity scores of
mice at 1, 7, and 14 days after tMCAO. n = 12 mice/group; ⁄⁄p < 0.01 vs. vehicle; ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.001 vs. unfractionated BMMNCs by one-way ANOVA followed by LSD
analysis.

treated with unfractionated BMMNCs (p = 0.003, Fig. 1B). We
observed no difference between mice that received CXCR4+CD45+
BMMNCs and those that received vehicle (p = 0.150, Fig. 1B). These
data suggest that CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs, but not CXCR4+CD45+
BMMNCs, can ameliorate infarction volume better than unfractionated BMMNCs.
Evaluations of mice by mNSS showed that neurologic deﬁcits
reached a peak on day 1 after tMCAO and did not differ signiﬁcantly among the four groups at that time (n = 12/group, F = 0.41,
p = 0.75; Fig. 1C). However, on days 7 and 14 after tMCAO, quantiﬁcation analysis indicated signiﬁcant differences among the
tMCAO groups (F = 18.47, p < 0.001 on day 7 and F = 30.92,
p < 0.001 on day 14). Mice treated with unfractionated BMMNCs
or CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs had signiﬁcantly lower deﬁcit scores
than did vehicle-treated mice on days 7 and 14. Consistent with
our infarction volume analysis, the CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC-treated
group also exhibited a lower score than did the unfractionated
BMMNC-treated group (day 7, p < 0.001; day 14, p < 0.01). However, CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNC treatment did not reduce the neurologic deﬁcits (day 7, p = 0.51; day 14, p = 0.86 compared to
vehicle treatment). These data suggest that grafting of CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs is superior to grafting of unfractionated BMMNCs
for reducing neurologic deﬁcits.
3.4. Effect of different cell grafts on the expression of VEGF and TNF-a
in brain after tMCAO
Bone marrow-derived cells provide neuroprotection by modulating growth factors and cytokines such as VEGF and TNF-a

(Brenneman et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2003; Fujita et al., 2010). To
compare the angiotrophic capacity and anti-inﬂammatory properties of unfractionated, CXCR4+CD45+, and CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs
after stroke, we investigated VEGF and TNF-a levels in the ischemic
hemisphere of mice after tMCAO (Fig. 2A). Quantiﬁcation indicated
that TNF-a expression was signiﬁcantly reduced by CXCR4+CD45
BMMNC treatment (p < 0.05) and increased by CXCR4+CD45+
BMMNC treatment (n = 6/group, p < 0.01, Fig. 2B). Additionally,
treatment with unfractionated BMMNCs increased VEGF level
compared to that in the vehicle-treated group (n = 6/group,
p < 0.01, Fig. 2C). This effect was enhanced by CXCR4+CD45
BMMNC treatment (n = 6/group, p < 0.01, vs. unfractionated
BMMNC treatment, Fig. 2C). However, there was no signiﬁcant difference between vehicle-treated and CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNC-treated groups (n = 6/group, p = 0.989, Fig. 2C). These data suggest
that CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs may provide neuroprotection by
modulating angiogenesis and anti-inﬂammatory effects and that
HSC-enriched CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs may secrete proinﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF-a. In sham-operated groups, no cell
treatment altered the expression levels of VEGF and TNF-a (Supplementary Fig. 3).
3.5. CXCR4+ BMMNCs migrate into the infarct area more robustly than
do unfractionated BMMNCs
Grafted cells must be able to migrate to the ischemic brain to be
effective after stroke. Therefore, we examined the distribution of
eGFP+ cells in the brain of tMCAO mice at various time points after
transplantation (Fig. 3C). At 1 h after transplantation, no eGFP+

and b-actin on day 3 after tMCAO. (B) Quantiﬁcation of band densities shows that TNF-a level was signiﬁcantly reduced by CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC transplantation but
increased by CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNC transplantation (n = 6 mice/group; ⁄p < 0.05, ⁄⁄p < 0.01 vs. vehicle; one-way ANOVA followed by LSD test). (C) VEGF expression was
signiﬁcantly increased by unfractionated BMMNCs and CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs (n = 6 mice/group; ⁄⁄p < 0.01 vs. vehicle; ##p < 0.01 vs. unfractionated BMMNCs; one-way
ANOVA followed by LSD test).

cells had inﬁltrated into the ischemic brain. At 6 h after transplantation, most of the unfractionated BMMNCs were still trapped in
blood vessels, but CXCR4+ BMMNCs had begun to migrate into
the brain parenchyma in the ischemic hemisphere. The grafted
eGFP+ cells in the brain were round or irregular in shape, with a
single nucleus and a high nucleus/plasma ratio. Quantiﬁcation of
the eGFP+ cells indicated that the number increased in a timedependent manner during the ﬁrst 3 days after transplantation
and decreased signiﬁcantly by day 21. The number of CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs and CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs in the ischemic brain
was greater than that of the unfractionated BMMNCs at 6, 12, 24,
and 72 h and 21 days after transplantation (n = 6 mice/group,
p < 0.001 at 6 and 72 h, p < 0.01 at 12 h, 24 h, and 21 days,
Fig. 3D); migration of eGFP+CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs and eGFP+CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs did not differ at any time point (all
p > 0.05, Fig. 3D). These data suggest that the CXCR4+ BMMNCs
migrate into the infarct area more actively than do unfractionated
BMMNCs. We did not observe eGFP+ cells in any BMMNC-treated
sham group on day 3 after cell transplantation (Supplementary
Fig. 4).

3.7. mRNA levels of pluripotency markers are higher in CXCR4+CD45
BMMNCs than in unfractionated BMMNCs in vitro
We examined mRNA expression levels of the transcription factors Oct-4 and Nanog in unfractionated, CXCR4+CD45+, and
CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs. Our data indicated that both the unfractionated BMMNCs and the CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs express these
pluripotency markers (Fig. 5A). However, the mRNA expression
of these markers was barely detectable in CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs.
Quantiﬁcation analysis revealed that mRNA levels of Oct4 and
Nanog were higher in CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs than in unfractionated BMMNCs (n = 6/group, p < 0.05, Fig. 5B and p < 0.001
Fig. 5C). The in vitro data together with our immunoﬂuorescence
ﬁndings suggested that pluripotent cells were enriched in the
CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC population, which may exhibit more plasticity than unfractionated BMMNCs. These results reinforce our
immunoﬂuorescence ﬁndings and conﬁrm that the stem cells in
CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs are not pluripotent and have little capacity
to transdifferentiate into other cell types.

4. Discussion
3.6. CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs are more plastic than BMMNCs in vivo
We investigated the plasticity of BMMNCs in the ischemic
boundary zone on day 21 after tMCAO. Double immunoﬂuorescence labeling revealed that grafted unfractionated BMMNCs and
CXCR4+CD45– BMMNCs both express the astrocyte marker GFAP
and endothelial cell marker CD31; however, we failed to detect
colocalization of eGFP with GFAP or CD31 in CXCR4+CD45+
BMMNC-treated mice (Fig. 4A and B). Quantiﬁcation indicated that
the ratios of eGFP+GFAP+/total eGFP+ and eGFP+CD31+/total eGFP+
were signiﬁcantly higher in the CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC-treated
group than in the unfractionated BMMNC-treated group (n = 6/
group, p < 0.01, Fig. 4C and D). In addition, we observed fewer
GFAP+ and CD31+ cells in the ischemic boundary zone of the
CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNC-treated group than in that of the other
two groups. This ﬁnding implies relatively weak brain tissue restoration. No eGFP+ cells were observed in the brains of sham-operated mice during the 21-day follow-up (Supplementary Fig. 5A
and B).

In this study, we obtained highly puriﬁed CXCR4+CD45 and
CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNC subpopulations by FACS isolation and compared their effect to that of unfractionated BMMNCs in mice subjected to tMCAO. We found that the CXCR4+CD45 subpopulation
is superior to unfractionated BMMNCs in ameliorating cerebral
damage and neurologic deﬁcits. Therefore, CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs
may become a promising cell source in stroke treatment. Consistent with our previous publications (Jiang et al., 2013; Wang
et al., 2013), transplantation of BMMNCs reduced the infarction
volume and neurologic deﬁcits compared to those in vehicle-treated groups. Notably, treatment with the CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs
enhanced these effects, whereas treatment with CXCR4+CD45+
BMMNCs provided no protection. Thus, CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs
are likely able to serve as a promising cell source for ischemic
stroke treatment.
During the acute and subacute phases of stroke, transplantation
of bone marrow-derived cells may provide neuroprotection by
attenuating inﬂammatory responses, secreting trophic and growth

factors, or promoting the release of such factors by resident cells.
An in vitro study showed that the conditioned media from cultured
BMMNCs has various bioactive factors that can protect neurons
from the effects of activated proinﬂammatory microglia (Sharma
et al., 2010). TNF-a, an inﬂammatory cytokine released by inﬁltrating leukocytes and local resident microglia after ischemic stroke,
contributes to the endothelial dysfunction that leads to damage
of blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity (Abdullah and Bayraktutan,
2014). In this study, we found that CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs
decreased TNF-a, whereas CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs increased

TNF-a compared with that in the vehicle-treated group. However,
TNF-a level did not differ signiﬁcantly between unfractionated
BMMNC-treated and vehicle-treated groups. It was reported previously that autologous BMMNC transplantation 48 h after acute
ischemic stroke reduced TNF-a level (Brenneman et al., 2010),
and we did observe a trend toward decreased TNF-a in the groups
treated with BMMNCs. Our ﬁndings raise the possibility that the
lymphocyte progenitor HSC-enriched CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNC population may harbor a population of pro-inﬂammatory cells. Depletion of such pro-inﬂammatory populations may enhance the

therapeutic effects of BMMNCs. Further investigation is needed to
determine whether the increased TNF-a levels are generated
endogenously by the stimulation/activation of local resident proinﬂammatory cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, or secreted
by the transplanted CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNCs.

VEGF, an endothelial cell-speciﬁc angiogenic factor, enhances
cell survival in oxygen-deﬁcient environments (Nor et al., 1999).
It has been demonstrated that bone marrow stem cells secrete
VEGF under hypoxic conditions and promote structure restoration
after myocardial infarction (Uemura et al., 2006). Additionally, we

have recently shown that BMMNCs upregulate the VEGF–VEGF
receptor 2 signaling pathway and promote angiogenesis in an animal model of vascular dementia (Wang et al., 2014). In the present
study, VEGF levels in the unfractionated BMMNC-treated group
were higher than those in the vehicle-treated group and were further enhanced by CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC treatment. In contrast,
the CXCR4+CD45+ subpopulation did not alter VEGF levels. In the
sham groups, no type of BMMNC transplantation altered TNF-a
and VEGF expression levels. These data suggest that the transplanted cells exert their protective effects speciﬁcally in the ischemic brain.
Various cell types in the brain, including neurons, astrocytes,
oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells and pericytes, are involved in
the damage caused by ischemic infarction. In addition to promoting the release of cytokines or neurotrophic factors through autocrine or paracrine routes, cell therapy might also stimulate
recovery from stroke by facilitating cell replacement and endogenous tissue remodeling (Liu et al., 2014a). However, grafted cells
must be able to reach the brain after stroke to carry out these
actions. In our study, intravenously injected cells appeared in the
brain as early as 6 h after administration. The eGFP+ cells in the
CXCR4+ population exhibited a robust ability to penetrate the
blood vessels and migrate into the ischemic boundary zone,
whereas unfractionated BMMNCs showed relatively weak
migration.
About a decade ago, it was reported that bone marrow-derived
HSCs could express cell markers of not only hematopoietic cell lineages but also non-hematopoietic neuronal cells (Eglitis and
Mezey, 1997; Mezey et al., 2000). An in vivo study in animal models of stroke further supported the ﬁndings (Hess et al., 2004),
which excited the regeneration ﬁeld and raised the possibility that
HSCs are fully plastic and may serve as a universal cell source for
tissue repair. However, in subsequent studies, the concept of HSC
transdifferentiation, as it was called, has been called into question
(Fukuda and Fujita, 2005; Murry et al., 2004; Wagers et al., 2002).
Proposals such as cell fusion with the recipient’s cells (Terada et al.,
2002; Ying et al., 2002) and epigenetic changes in the recipient’s
tissues (Hochedlinger and Jaenisch, 2003, 2002) were unable to
fully explain the mechanisms of HSC transdifferentiation. However, the discrepancy might be explained by the presence of preexisting TCSCs in the bone marrow-derived HSCs (Kucia et al., 2005).

Brain remodeling is critically dependent on the function of supportive structures, such as blood vessels, and plaque formation
(Hess and Hill, 2011). In vivo studies have shown that BMMNCs
express cell-speciﬁc markers such as CD31 and GFAP, and thus
are capable of acquiring the phenotype of cells belonging to multiple lineages after transplantation (Iihoshi et al., 2004; Shichinohe
et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013). In this study, we tracked the fate
of the grafted cells in brain and compared their ability to acquire
phenotypes of linages such as astrocytes and endothelial cells.
The astrocyte-speciﬁc cell marker GFAP and endothelial cell-speciﬁc marker CD31 colocalized with GFP in both unfractionated
BMMNC-treated and CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC-treated groups. No
colocalization was observed in the HSC-enriched CXCR4+CD45+
BMMNC-treated group. In addition, the density of GFAP- and
CD31-positive cells in the ischemic boundary zone of CXCR4+CD45+ BMMNC-treated mice was quite low, indicating that brain
restoration and remodeling in this group was weak.
Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cell and have a
‘‘housekeeping’’ role in the central nervous system. Under physiologic conditions, they provide neuron-glial structural support,
facilitate neuronal metabolism, maintain the extracellular environment, regulate CBF, and are involved in intercellular communications and neurotransmitter synthesis. Astrocytes and endothelial
cells are also important to brain remodeling during the scarring
process and revascularization. When the brain is injured, such as
by ischemic stroke, astrocytes combat oxidative stress and construct glial scars to create a physical and functional barrier that
segregates the intact tissue from the cascading wave of uncontrolled tissue damage (Faulkner et al., 2004). Recently, GFAP-reactive astrocytes were shown to be important for axon remodeling
and motor function recovery in a mouse stroke model (Liu et al.,
2014b). Endothelial cells are key components of the BBB and are
essential to neovascularization and maintenance of BBB integrity,
but these functions are compromised after stroke. Treatment to
attenuate BBB dysfunction may help to improve neurologic outcomes and facilitate recovery (Widiapradja et al., 2014). Here, we
found that GFAP+ or CD31+ cells were more abundant in eGFP+ cells
from the CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC-treated group than in those from
mice treated with unfractionated BMMNCs. Thus, the CXCR4+CD45 subpopulation could be better than unfractionated
BMMNCs for brain remodeling and repair. Based on our ﬁndings,

J. Wang et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 45 (2015) 98–108

we postulate that the CXCR4+CD45 subpopulation has more cells
that are able to differentiate into other cell lineages; in other
words, this population has more ‘‘plasticity’’ than the unfractionated BMMNCs in vivo. Our results are consistent with those of a
study in which one GFP-labeled HSC was transplanted into a lethally irradiated wild-type mouse. The HSC repopulated blood cells
but not non-hematopoietic tissues (Wagers et al., 2002). These
studies indicate that the transdifferentiation of HSCs occurs rarely,
if ever (Fukuda and Fujita, 2005; Murry et al., 2004; Wagers et al.,
2002). Our observations further conﬁrm the ﬁndings by Kucia et al.
(2005) that TCSCs are enriched with non-hematopoietic CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs.
Nanog and Oct4 are the core transcription factors present in
early embryonic tissues. They function as regulators to maintain
the network responsible for self-renewal and pluripotency. Interestingly, we found that both Nanog and Oct4 mRNA levels were signiﬁcantly higher in CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs than in unfractionated
BMMNCs, whereas neither was detectable in the CXCR4+CD45+
population. These results reinforce the ﬁnding that CXCR4+ TCSCs
express early embryonic transcription factors (Kucia et al., 2004;
Ratajczak et al., 2004). Taken together, these data conﬁrm that pluripotent cells are enriched in the CXCR4+CD45 subpopulation but
not in the CXCR4+CD45+ subpopulation.
One limitation of this study is that we only investigated the ability of BMMNCs to acquire the endothelial and astrocyte phenotypes
that are essential for restoration after stroke. We focused only on the
brain remodeling process and did not track the fate of the grafted
cells in neuronal phenotype acquisition. Direct replacement of neurons would be an important therapeutic mechanism. Additional
research will be carried out to test this possibility.
Recently, Ratajczak and colleagues identiﬁed a small and very
rare population of cells that express pluripotency markers and
can differentiate into three germ layers. Known as very small
embryonic-like (VSEL) stem cells, they are a highly promising
source of cells for neural regeneration (Kucia et al., 2006). However, because of their limited number, they are difﬁcult to isolate
and require proliferation before transplantation (Borlongan et al.,
2011). In addition, their population decreases as humans age, limiting their application in older individuals (Ratajczak et al., 2011).
Thus, the use of VSELs for stroke treatment is currently impractical.
In this report, we provide evidence that allogeneic CXCR4+CD45 BMMNC grafts are superior to unfractionated BMMNCs in
improving stroke outcomes in the tMCAO mouse model. Because
this subpopulation represents a relatively small portion of unfractionated BMMNCs, cell source shortage is the biggest obstacle to
potential clinical applications. Future investigations should focus
on optimizing cell dosages and enhancing their therapeutic efﬁcacy. For example, adopting an intranasal delivery route could
reduce the number of cells required and shorten the time needed
for cells to migrate into the lesion area. Additionally, a combination
of gene and cell therapies in which exogenous genes such as VEGF
or nerve growth factor are overexpressed could promote angiogenesis and/or neurogenesis and neuroprotection. Because CXCR4+CD45 BMMNCs provide better protection after ischemic stroke
than unfractionated BMMNCs and can be easily and efﬁciently harvested and puriﬁed from bone marrow, they may serve as a promising candidate for stoke therapy.
