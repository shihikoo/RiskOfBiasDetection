Abstract Cortical glial cells contain both ionotropic and
metabotropic glutamate receptors. Despite several efforts, a
comprehensive analysis of the entire family of glutamate
receptors and their subunits present in glial cells is still
missing. Here, we provide an overall picture of the gene
expression of ionotropic (AMPA, kainate, NMDA) and the
main metabotropic glutamate receptors in cortical glial cells
isolated from GFAP/EGFP mice before and after focal
cerebral ischemia. Employing single-cell RT-qPCR, we
detected the expression of genes encoding subunits of glutamate receptors in GFAP/EGFP-positive (GFAP/EGFP?)
glial cells in the cortex of young adult mice. Most of the
analyzed cells expressed mRNA for glutamate receptor
subunits, the expression of which, in most cases, even increased after ischemic injury. Data analyses disclosed several classes of GFAP/EGFP? glial cells with respect to
glutamate receptors and revealed in what manner their expression correlates with the expression of glial markers prior
to and after ischemia. Furthermore, we also examined the
protein expression and functional significance of NMDA

receptors in glial cells. Immunohistochemical analyses of all
seven NMDA receptor subunits provided direct evidence
that the GluN3A subunit is present in GFAP/EGFP? glial
cells and that its expression is increased after ischemia.
In situ and in vitro Ca2? imaging revealed that Ca2?
elevations evoked by the application of NMDA were diminished in GFAP/EGFP? glial cells following ischemia.
Our results provide a comprehensive description of glutamate receptors in cortical GFAP/EGFP? glial cells and may
serve as a basis for further research on glial cell physiology
and pathophysiology.

Introduction
The era when glial cells were considered to be just passive
bystanders of neuronal transmission was supplanted by a
new era in which they are seen to actively communicate
with neurons and participate in crucial processes, including
the development of the nervous system, synaptic plasticity,
and synaptogenesis. Glial cells of ectodermal origin are
divided according to their function into astrocytes, NG2
glia (also called polydendrocytes or oligodendrocyte precursor cells—OPCs), oligodendrocytes, and ependymal
cells. In this work, we studied GFAP/EGFP? glial cells,
which mostly comprise astrocytes; however, there are
indications of NG2 glia overlap, especially in juvenile
animals (Matthias et al. 2003; Serrano et al. 2008).
Similarly to neurons, glial cells possess a variety of
metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors.
Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1-8) regulate
various intracellular signal cascades, and several of these

123

1188

receptors have been identified in astrocytes, with mGluR3
and mGluR5 being the most abundant (Verkhratsky 2009;
Loane et al. 2012). Ionotropic glutamate receptors are divided according to their specific agonists into three
groups—AMPA, kainate, and NMDA. They differ in their
subunit composition, functional properties such as desensitization rate or specificity in ion permeability, and also in
their different occurrence in various brain cell types depending on the CNS region. AMPA receptor subunits
(GluA1-4) are present in astrocytes in most brain regions
(Seifert and Steinhäuser 2001), and their subunit composition determines their Ca2? permeability (Hollmann et al.
1991; Burnashev et al. 1992). All kainate receptor subunits
(GluK1-5) have been identified in astrocytes either on the
mRNA or protein level (Brand-Schieber et al. 2004);
however, the functional properties of these receptors have
not been demonstrated so far. The last group of astrocytic
glutamate receptors is NMDA receptors composed of
GluN1-3B subunits, which is a highly debatable receptor
family with a large therapeutic potential (for review see
Verkhratsky and Kirchhoff 2007; Dzamba et al. 2013). In
contrast to neuronal NMDA receptors, they do not possess
a Mg2? block (Lalo et al. 2006; Castillo et al. 2013), so
they are also functional at resting membrane potential,
which is probably due to their specific combination of
subunits, including the most recently discovered GluN3A
and GluN3B subunits. The impact of ischemia on NMDA
receptors has been studied in hippocampal astrocytes
(Gottlieb and Matute 1997; Krebs et al. 2003), but to the
best of our knowledge, there are currently no data regarding cortical astrocytes after ischemia; therefore, we
specifically focused on these receptors.
In this work, we used single-cell gene expression profiling, which is a novel and powerful method enabling us to
study the correlation of transcript levels among individual
cells (Ståhlberg and Bengtsson 2010), which is not possible
using classical bulk samples composed of a large number
of cells. The goal of this work was to characterize GFAP/
EGFP-positive (GFAP/EGFP?) cells in the cortex of
GFAP/EGFP mice after focal cerebral ischemia and to
present a detailed overall picture of glutamate receptors in
individual GFAP/EGFP? glial cells with a main focus on
NMDA receptors.

Materials and Methods
Induction of Focal Ischemic Injury in GFAP/EGFP
Mice: Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
(MCAo) Model
The experiments were performed on GFAP/EGFP transgenic mice [line designation TgN(GFAPEGFP)], in which

123

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:1187–1202

the expression of EGFP is controlled by the human GFAP
promoter (Nolte et al. 2001). All procedures involving the
use of laboratory animals were performed in accordance
with the European Communities Council Directive 24
November 1986 (86/609/EEC) and animal care guidelines
approved by the Institute of Experimental Medicine,
Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic (Animal Care
Committee on April 17, 2009; approval number 85/2009
and 036/2012).
Before the induction of focal ischemia, adult mice were
anesthetized with 1.5 % isoflurane (Abbot, IL, USA) and
maintained in 1 % isoflurane using a vaporizer (Tec-3,
Cyprane Ltd., UK). A skin incision between the orbit and
the external auditory meatus was made, and a hole
(1–2 mm in diameter) was drilled through the frontal bone
1 mm rostral to the fusion of the zygoma and the
squamosal bone and about 3.5 mm ventral to the dorsal
surface of the brain. The dura was opened, gently removed,
and the exposed middle cerebral artery was occluded by a
short coagulation with bipolar tweezers (SMT, Czech
Republic) at a proximal location, followed by transection
of the vessel to ensure permanent occlusion. During the
surgery, heating pad was used to maintain the mouse’s
body temperature at 37 ± 1 °C (Honsa et al. 2012).
Preparation of Cell Suspensions from the Cortex
of GFAP/EGFP Mice
Before the collection of single GFAP/EGFP? cells utilizing
flow cytometry, the cortical tissue was dissociated using
papain treatment. In the experiment, the cells were collected from uninjured mice (5 mice, 63–108 days old; 246
cells), mice 7 days after MCAo (4 mice, 57–64 days old;
199 cells), and mice 14 days after MCAo (3 mice, 64 days
old; 126 cells). The animals were deeply anesthetized with
pentobarbital (PTB, 100 mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma-Aldrich, MO,
USA) and perfused transcardially with cold (4–8 °C) isolation buffer containing (in mM) NaCl 136.0, KCl 5.4,
HEPES 10.0, glucose 5.5, and osmolality 290 ± 3 mOsm/
kg. To isolate the cerebral cortex, a part of the brain (?2 to
-2 mm rostro-caudally from bregma) was sliced into
400-lm coronal sections using an HM650V vibrating microtome (MICROM International GmbH, Germany), and
the dorsal cerebral cortex was carefully dissected out from
the ventral white matter tracks. In mice after MCAo, the
ischemic core with its surrounding tissue (cca 1/2 of the
injured hemisphere) was used. The tissue was incubated
with continuous shaking at 37 °C for 45–60 min in 5 ml of
a papain solution (20 U/ml) and 0.2 ml DNase (both from
Worthington, NJ, USA) prepared in isolation buffer. After
papain treatment, the tissue was mechanically dissociated
by gentle trituration using a 1-ml pipette. According to the
manufacturer’s instructions, the dissociated cells were

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:1187–1202

layered on top of 5 ml of ovomucoid inhibitor solution and
harvested by centrifugation (1409g for 6 min). Cell aggregates were removed by filtering with a 30-lm cell
strainer (Becton–Dickinson, NJ, USA), and the cells were
kept on ice until sorting. This method routinely yielded
*2 9 106 cells per mouse brain.
Collection of Single GFAP/EGFP1 Cells by Flow
Cytometry
The collection of single cells was performed using flow
cytometer (BD Influx, CA, USA), which was manually
calibrated to deposit single cells in the center of each well
of 96-well plates (Life Technologies, CA, USA) that were
placed on a pre-cooled rack. Only viable and GFAP/
EGFP? cells were collected. The viability of the cells was
checked using Hoechst 33258 (Life Technologies). Single
cells were collected into 5 ll nuclease-free water with
bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ll; Fermentas, IL, USA)) and
RNaseOut (20 U; Life Technologies). Collected cells in
96-well plates were stored at -80 °C immediately after
sorting.
Single-Cell Gene Expression Profiling of Mouse
Astrocytes
The gene expression profiling of single GFAP/EGFP? glial
cells was performed according to the protocol described in
(Rusnakova et al. 2013). Briefly, RNA from single cells
was transcribed into cDNA in the wells of 96-well plates.
To increase the sensitivity of RT-qPCR, the cDNA from
one-half of the cells were first pre-amplified. Subsequently,
such pre-processed samples were analyzed for the expression of 25 genes of interest (for primer sequences see
(Rusnakova et al. 2013), Grin3b forward primer
TGGTCGGGGACAAGACATTT,
reverse
primer
TCCGTGTGGAGTGGTAGGTG) using the BioMark
qPCR platform (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA, USA). Data
were analyzed in GenEx v.6 software (MultiD, Sweden)
utilizing the Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM) method
and principal component analysis (PCA), which divided all
cells into three subpopulations according to the expression
of these 25 genes. The Spearman correlation coefficients
between genes were calculated in SAS v.9.3 software using
all data, including the managed off-scale data. Only correlation coefficients for genes having a p value \0.05 are
presented in the results.
Immunohistochemistry
The mice were deeply anesthetized with PTB (100 mg/kg,
i.p.) and perfused transcardially with 20 ml of saline followed by 20 ml of cooled 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) in

1189

0.1 M phosphate buffer. Brains were dissected out, postfixed for 18 h, and placed stepwise in solutions with
gradually increasing sucrose concentrations (10, 20, 30 %)
for cryoprotection. Coronal 30-lm-thick slices were prepared using a microtome (HM550, Microm International,
Germany). The slices were incubated with 5 % Chemiblocker (Millipore, MA, USA) and 0.2 % Triton in phosphate-buffered saline. This blocking solution was also used
as the diluent for the antisera. The slices were incubated
with the primary antibodies at 4–8 °C overnight, then the
secondary antibodies were applied for 2 h. As primary
antibodies, we used anti-GluN1 (1:500; Abcam, Cambridge, UK, AB28669), anti-GluN2A (1:400; Abcam,
AB106957), anti-GluN2B (1:400; Abcam, AB65875), antiGluN2C (1:400; Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel, AGC018), anti-GluN2D (1:400; Alomone Labs, AGC-020),
anti-GluN3A (1:400; Abcam, AB111226), and antiGluN3B (1:500; Abcam, AB35677). As the secondary
antibody, we used goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with
Alexa Fluor 594 (1:200; Molecular Probes, CA, USA,
A-11012). The slices were mounted using Aqua Poly/
Mount (Polysciences Inc., Germany). All chemicals were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise stated.
A Zeiss 510DUO LSM confocal microscope equipped
with Arg/HeNe lasers was used for immunohistochemical
analysis. Stacks of consecutive confocal images taken at
intervals of 3 lm were acquired sequentially with two
lasers to avoid cross-talk between fluorescent labels. The
background noise of each confocal image was reduced by
averaging four image inputs. For each image stack the gain
and detector offset were adjusted to minimize saturated
pixels, yet still permit the detection of weakly stained cell
processes. Colocalization images were made using a Zeiss
LSM Image Browser.
Preparation of Primary Cultures
Primary cultures of GFAP/EGFP? glial cells were prepared
from 40- to 57-day-old mice, either uninjured or those
13–14 days after MCAo. The animals were deeply anesthetized with PTB (100 mg/kg, i.p) and perfused transcardially with cold (4–8 °C) NMDG isolation solution
containing (in mM) 110 NMDG-Cl, 2.5 KCl, 24.5
NaHCO3, 1.25 Na2HPO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2, and 20
glucose (pH 7.4, osmolality 290 mOsm/kg). The brain was
sliced into 200-lm coronal sections as described above,
and the cortical tissue was dissected out. In mice 14 days
after MCAo, the dissected tissue consisted of the ischemic
core and its surrounding tissue (cca 1/2 of the injured
hemisphere). The isolated tissue was transferred into 1 ml
of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) solution containing
(in mM) 122 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1.3 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 28
NaHCO3, 1.25 Na2HPO4, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4,

123

1190

osmolality 305 mOsm/kg), which was supplemented with
0.05 % trypsin (Life technologies), and incubated with
continuous shaking at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation,
the tissue was transferred into 1 ml of trypsin inhibitor
(Sigma-Aldrich) and dissociated by gentle trituration using
a 1-ml pipette. Subsequently, the cells were plated in a
volume of 0.15 ml onto 6 coverslips in a 24-well plate, and
0.5 ml of fresh cultivation medium was added into each
well. The cultivation medium consisted of high-glucose
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Life Technologies)
supplemented with 15 % fetal bovine serum (PAA
Laboratories GmbH, Austria), 2 mM L-glutamine (SigmaAldrich), and antibiotic–antimycotic containing penicillin,
streptomycin, and amphotericin B (Life Technologies).
Cells were cultured in an incubator (100 % humidity, 5 %
CO2) at 37 °C for 5–6 days without medium exchange.
Calcium Imaging Measurements
In situ measurements were performed in the somatosensory
cortex of 35–59-day-old GFAP/EGFP mice, either uninjured or mice 13–14 days after MCAo. Transversal brain
slices (200 lm thick) were cut in cold (4–8 °C) NMDG
isolation solution using a vibration microtome and were
kept at room temperature in aCSF solution. The slices were
then mounted in a microscope superfusion chamber, which
was continually perfused with HEPES-based aCSF containing (in mM) 135 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2, 1
Na2HPO4, 10 Glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4, osmolality
305 mOsm/kg, equilibrated with O2) at a flow rate of
2.5 ml/min. The regions with GFAP/EGFP? cells, which
were 10–20 lm below the surface of the slice, were then
found and their positions were recorded. The loading procedure was performed at room temperature in the measurement chamber for 40 min in 3 ml of HEPES-based
aCSF (the flow was interrupted during this period) containing 1 lM OGB-1 AM with 0.02 % Pluronic F-127 and
continually bubbled with O2 to avoid ischemic conditions.
After the loading, the flow of HEPES-based aCSF was
reestablished and the measurements were performed with
the cells found prior to the loading. The solutions [Nmethyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), L-glutamic acid (glutamate),
glycine, memantine hydrochloride (memantine), NBQX,
and PPADS from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany; DL-2-amino-5phosphonovaleric acid (DL-APV) from Ascent Scientific,
UK; and tetrodotoxin (TTX) from Alomone labs, Israel]
were applied through a capillary with an i.d. of 250 lm
located 0.5–1 mm from the measurement region and connected to a Perfusion Pressure Kit pressurized application
system with a flow rate of 600 ll/min controlled by a
ValveBank II controller (AutoMate Scientific, Inc.,
Berkeley, CA, USA). The HEPES-based aCSF was applied
via the application system throughout the entire experiment

123

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:1187–1202

to ensure that the Ca2? responses were not influenced by
the application itself and to accelerate the solution exchange in the vicinity of recorded cells. OGB-1 fluorescence was detected with a TILL Photonics Imaging System
installed on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 FS Plus microscope
equipped with a long-distance 940 objective (IR Achroplan 0.8 W, Zeiss, Germany). A digital camera (PCO
Sensicam, Kelheim, Germany) was controlled by TILLvisION software. The excitation light (488 nm) was generated by a Polychrome V (TILL Photonics GmbH,
Gräfelfing, Germany), filtered by a BP 450–490 excitation
band-pass filter, reflected by a FT 510 beam splitter, and
the emitted light was filtered by a LP 515 long-pass filter
(Filter Set 09, Zeiss, Germany). Images were acquired at
0.83 Hz and were analyzed offline. Fluorescence intensity
(F) was measured in the cell bodies and expressed after
background correction as F - Fb, where Fb was the
background fluorescence intensity in the proximity of the
analyzed cell. The baseline F - Fb signal was then normalized to 100 %, and the area under the curve was
measured during 1 min from the onset of application (expressed in arbitrary units). For measuring the delay of the
response, the signal threshold for Ca2? responses in situ
was 200 % of the amplitude of the noise signal, and the
responses were taken into account only if they occurred
within 1 min from the onset of application.
In vitro Ca2? imaging measurements were performed
similarly to in situ measurements with the exception of the
OGB-1 AM loading procedure. Coverslips with 5–6-dayold cell cultures were incubated for 45 min in 0.5 ml of
cultivation medium containing 1.5 lM OGB-1 AM and
0.03 % Pluronic F-127 (Life Technologies) at 37 °C in an
incubator (100 % humidity, 5 % CO2). Fluorescence intensity (F) was measured in the cell bodies, if not stated
otherwise, and the area under the curve was measured from
fluorescence intensity F during 1 min from the onset of
application (expressed in arbitrary units). Since noise signal in Ca2? imaging in vitro was minimal, for measuring
the delay of the response, the threshold for Ca2? responses
was set to 120 % of the baseline fluorescence, and responses were taken into account only if they occurred
within 1 min from the onset of application.

Results
In this study, GFAP/EGFP? glial cells isolated from the
cortices of GFAP/EGFP mice were studied in young adult
uninjured mice (controls) and in mice 7 and 14 days after
MCAo. Employing a single-cell RT-qPCR technique, we
were able to detect changes in the expression of the genes
coding particular subunits of glutamate receptors following
ischemia. For this purpose, the cells were isolated using

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:1187–1202

papain dissociation, sorted on a flow cytometer according
to their EGFP fluorescence and individually analyzed by
single-cell analysis.
Expression Profile of Glutamate Receptor Subunits
in Uninjured and Post-ischemic Mouse Brains
At first, we analyzed the incidence of GFAP/EGFP? cells
expressing the genes of particular ionotropic glutamate
receptor subunits of the AMPA (Gria1-4), kainate (Grik1–
5), and NMDA (Grin1–3b) types and of metabotropic
glutamate receptors (Grm1,3,5) in controls and mice 7 and
14 days after MCAo (Fig. 1). The majority of GFAP/
EGFP? cells (567 out of 571) expressed typical astrocytic
markers, such as Slc1a3, Glul, Gfap, or Aqp4. Four cells,
which expressed only markers of NG2 glia (Cspg4 and/or
Pdgfra) and did not express any astrocytic marker (Slc1a3,
Glul, Gfap, and Aqp4), were excluded from the analysis;
however, this did not lead to any substantial changes in the
gene expression profiling.
The lowest expression from all AMPA receptor subunits
was found with the Gria1 gene, which was expressed only
in 2 % of cells isolated from controls (control cells). In
cells isolated from mice 7 and 14 days after induction of
MCAo (D7 and D14 cells), the incidence of cells expressing the Gria1 gene was higher, but did not exceed
12 %. Very interesting results were obtained in the case of
the Gria2 gene, which was present in numerous control

subunits of glutamate receptors in control mice and in mice after

and from mice 7 and 14 days after MCAo (D7, 4 mice, 196 cells and
D14, 3 mice, 125 cells) were used. Genes coding AMPA receptors

cells (61 %) with no significant change in expression after
MCAo. The GluA2 subunit, the protein product of the
Gria2 gene, is crucial for the Ca2? permeability of the
AMPA receptors and, for example, in cerebellar Bergmann
glia this subunit is absent (Hollmann et al. 1991; Burnashev
et al. 1992). The Gria3 gene was expressed in 4 % of the
control cells; however, in D7 and D14 cells its expression
was significantly increased (43 and 50 %, respectively).
The Gria4 gene was expressed in 10 % of the control cells,
while the number of cells expressing this gene increased to
51 % in D7 cells and to 49 % in D14 cells. Thus, after
MCAo, the gene expression of 3 out of 4 AMPA receptor
subunits was increased at least fourfold.
A similar trend was observed with genes coding kainate
receptor subunits. The numbers of cells expressing
Grik1,2,3,4,5 were increased 10-, 3-, 9-, 15-, and 2-fold
after MCAo. The maximum expression of Grik3,4 was
observed in D7 cells and that of Grik1,2,5 in D14 cells.
The expression of genes coding the subunits of NMDA
receptors underwent dramatic changes as well. The Grin1
gene was present in 7 % of the control cells, and this
number was increased to 30 % in D7 and 43 % in D14
cells. From among all of the Grin2 genes, the only gene
that displayed a significant increase in the number of expressing cells after MCAo was Grin2d. The Grin3a gene,
which codes the recently discovered GluN3A subunit of
NMDA receptors with a prominent effect on the Mg2?
block and Ca2? permeability of NMDA receptors (Perez-

and metabotropic glutamate receptors (Grm1,3,5) were studied. Error
bars represent SEM. Significant differences between D7/D14 compared to CTRL (*p \ 0.05, **p \ 0.01, ***p \ 0.001) and D14
compared to D7 (#p \ 0.05, ##p \ 0.01) were calculated by one-way
ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post-test

123

1192

Otano et al. 2001; Cavara and Hollmann 2008), was expressed in 7–12-fold more cells isolated from mice after
ischemic insult when compared to control cells (30 % of
D7 and 50 % of D14 cells compared to 4 % in control
cells). The expression of the Grin3b gene was very low; we
detected it only in 1 % of control cells and 2 % of D7 cells,
while there was no expression in D14 cells.
Together with ionotropic glutamate receptors, we also
studied the expression of genes coding the most abundant
metabotropic receptor subunits in glial cells Grm1,3,5
(D’Antoni et al. 2008). Ten percent of control cells expressed Grm1, and this incidence did not significantly
change after MCAo. The number of cells expressing Grm3
shifted from 56 % in control cells to 30–32 % after MCAo.
The largest increase in the percentage of cells expressing a
particular gene after MCAo was observed with Grm5,
which was detected in only 1.6 % of the control cells.
Following ischemic injury, its expression increased 13-fold
in D7 cells and 33-fold in D14 cells. This is in accordance
with other studies showing the absence of Grm5 in adult
astrocytes under physiological conditions (Sun et al. 2013)
and an increased presence of Grm5 mRNA and mGluR5
protein in reactive astrocytes (Ulas et al. 2000; Aronica
et al. 2000). Moreover, Grm5 together with Grin2d was the
only genes with significantly increased expression in D14
cells when compared to D7 cells.
Gene Expression Profiling of Distinct
Subpopulations of GFAP/EGFP1 Cells
There have been several recent studies demonstrating the
heterogeneity of GFAP/EGFP? cells (Serrano et al. 2008;
Ståhlberg et al. 2011; Benesova et al. 2012; Rusnakova
et al. 2013). The single-cell RT-qPCR method used in this
work is suitable for studying such heterogeneity, since it
provides information about the gene expression levels of
several genes in individual cells, with the possibility to
further analyze the division of the cells into subpopulations. In this study, PCA was used to find three distinct
subpopulations (SP1–SP3) among a pool of control, D7,
and D14 cells (Fig. 2a). The SOM analysis, which forced
the division of the cells into three groups, confirmed the
stable classification of these subpopulations. The division
into subpopulations was performed according to the similarity in gene expression of glial cell markers (Cspg4,
Pdgfra, Slc1a3, Glul, Gfap, Aqp4) and glutamate receptor
subunits (Gria1–4, Grik1–5, Grin1–3b, Grm1,3,5). There
was an interesting tendency in the representation of control,
D7, and D14 cells in these subpopulations (Fig. 2b).
Subpopulation SP1 mostly comprised control cells, SP2
contained 30 % of control cells but mostly D7 cells, and
SP3 was formed almost solely by cells after MCAo (42 %

123

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:1187–1202

of D7 cells and 54 % of D14 cells). From the bar plot
showing the expression levels of genes in the SP1–SP3
subpopulations (Fig. 2c), it is evident that the highest gene
transcript levels were in subpopulation SP3, which consisted especially of D7 and D14 cells, indicating the importance of glutamate receptors after ischemia. This also
corresponded with the increased percentage of cells expressing genes coding glutamate receptors after MCAo
(Fig. 1).
Spearman Correlation Coefficients
Even though there is heterogeneity among GFAP/EGFP?
cells, there were still some trends in gene expression patterns when comparing control, D7, and D14 cells. In the
next step, we focused on a detailed classification of control
cells and those isolated at particular times after MCAo. For
this purpose, the Spearman correlation coefficients between
pairs of genes were calculated; all of the correlation coefficients are shown in Online Resource 1. Since some of
the GFAP/EGFP? cells also expressed genes coding the
NG2 glial markers Cspg4 and/or Pdgfra as previously
shown (Rusnakova et al. 2013), we were able to assess
significant correlations between genes coding glutamate
receptors and glial cells markers (Fig. 3).
The lowest number of correlations was observed in
control cells. Six genes (Gria1, Gria3, Grik5, Grin2d,
Grin3b, and Grm5) did not correlate with any glial marker
in this group, while the remaining 13 genes correlated
positively with at least one NG2 glial marker. Positive
correlations with at least 2 out of 4 astrocytic markers were
observed only with 3 genes (Gria2, Grin2c, and Grm3),
whereas negative correlations were found with 4 genes
(Gria4, Grik3, Grin2a, and Grm1). In control cells, we can
summarize that most of the glutamate receptors were
especially present in GFAP/EGFP? cells, which expressed
NG2 glial markers.
The correlation coefficients in D7 cells showed a strong
positive correlation of AMPA and kainate receptor subunits
with NG2 glial markers, which was not true for NMDA
receptor subunits (a positive correlation with only Grin1,
Grin3a, and marginally Grin2d) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (a positive correlation with Grm5 only). In
contrast to control cells, almost all glutamate receptor
subunits displayed a positive correlation with astrocytic
markers in D7 cells. Surprisingly, a positive correlation
was also observed between the astrocytic marker Slc1a3
and the NG2 glial markers Cspg4 and Pdgfra (see Online
Resource 1), which reflects the complex changes accompanying reactive astrogliosis after an ischemic insult.
In D14 cells, the situation was much more comprehensible. There was no positive correlation between genes

Genes

Fig. 2 Gene expression profiling of distinct subpopulations of GFAP/
EGFP? cells isolated from the cortex of GFAP/EGFP mice.
a Principal component analysis (PCA) of cells from control mice
(CTRL, 246 cells/5 mice) and those 7 and 14 days after MCAo (D7,
199 cells/4 mice; D14, 126 cells/3 mice). The data were meancentered according to the genes. The cells were divided into three
groups by Kohonen self-organizing maps (SOM) and are marked by
different symbols (squares for subpopulation SP1, circles for

subpopulation SP2, and triangles for subpopulation SP3). b Percentage representation of CTRL, D7, and D14 cells in the subpopulations
SP1–3. c Bar plot with SEM showing the relative expression of the
analyzed genes in subpopulations SP1–3. Significant differences
between SP2/SP3 compared to SP1 (***p \ 0.001) and SP3
compared to SP2 (#p \ 0.05, ##p \ 0.01, ###p \ 0.001) were calculated by one-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post-test

coding NG2 glial and astrocytic markers (see Online Resource 1), and also most of the genes coding glutamate
receptor subunits correlated positively only with NG2 glial
or astrocytic markers. For AMPA receptors, the correlation
coefficients were similar to those in control cells. The only
difference was with the Gria3 gene, which was positively
correlated with astrocytic markers in D14 cells. Kainate
receptors also showed a similar trend as in control cells,
since they were mostly correlated with NG2 glial markers.
Intriguingly, NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptors
showed a very distinct correlation pattern, as Grin2a-d and
Grm3,5 showed a strong negative correlation with NG2
glial markers and a positive correlation with astrocytic
markers. The only genes coding NMDA receptor subunits
that positively correlated with NG2 glial markers were
Grin1 and Grin3a.

Immunohistochemical Analysis of NMDA Receptor
Subunits
The single-cell RT-qPCR studies provided us with information about the levels of mRNA transcripts in single
cells. As the next step, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis to verify that these transcripts were
translated into proteins. For this analysis, we chose NMDA
receptors since there are many unresolved questions about
their presence and function in glial cells (Dzamba et al.
2013).
The immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 4) showed
staining of cortical GFAP/EGFP? glial cells for individual
NMDA receptor subunits (GluN1, GluN2A-D, and
GluN3A-B) in tissue slices from controls and from mice
14 days after MCAo, in which the images were taken from

Fig. 3 Spearman correlation coefficients between genes coding
glutamate receptor subunits and markers of NG2 glia/astrocytes in
control cells (CTRL) and in cells 7 and 14 days after MCAo (D7,
D14). The correlation coefficients were calculated from all cells
including those without any expression of the studied genes. Positive

correlations are highlighted in green, negative in red. All the values of
the correlation coefficients are significant with p \ 0.05. Correlation

the ischemic rim (Fig. 4b). The analysis revealed that there
were GFAP/EGFP? cells positively stained for the
GluN3A subunit in controls; however, we did not observe
any GFAP/EGFP? glial cells positively stained for other
NMDA receptor subunits under control conditions. In
contrast, 14 days after MCAo, we observed GFAP/EGFP?
cells positive for the NMDA receptor subunits GluN1,
GluN2B-D, and GluN3A close to the ischemic lesion.
Immunohistochemical staining for the GluN2A subunit
differed from that of the rest of the subunits since none of
the GFAP/EGFP? cells were positive for GluN2A; the only
positive cells morphologically resembled neurons. As for
the GluN3B immunostaining, there were positive cells in
subcortical regions (data not shown), but none of the cells
in the cortex were positive, which correlates with the single-cell RT-qPCR results. Nonetheless, the immunohistochemical analysis revealed that especially after ischemia,
many GFAP/EGFP? cells became positive for most of the
NMDA receptor subunits.

GFAP/EGFP mice, either in controls or mice 13–14 days
after MCAo (D13–14 mice).
First of all, we aimed to clarify what is the delay of the
NMDA-evoked Ca2? responses and to what extent are
NMDA-evoked intracellular Ca2? elevations dependent on
agonist concentration. The average delay of the onset of
Ca2? responses following an application of 100 lM
NMDA was 32.4 s (Fig. 5a). Moreover, the Ca2? responses
also differed in their kinetics; they displayed a large variability ranging from fast transient Ca2? spikes to gradual
changes of Ca2? concentration indicating sustained Ca2?
entry. As expected, the Ca2? elevations increased with the
concentration of NMDA applied, as 4 lM and 20 lM
NMDA-evoked responses were lower by 78 and 42 %,
respectively, when compared to the application of 100 lM
NMDA (Fig. 5b). The distribution of Ca2? responses
evoked by 100 lM NMDA did not reveal any heterogeneity in the magnitude of the responses (Fig. 5c). The
co-application of 1 lM TTX did not result in any significant decrease in the Ca2? responses evoked by 100 lM
NMDA (Fig. 5d). The responses to the application of
100 lM NMDA were sensitive to the selective NMDA
receptor antagonist DL-APV, which markedly blocked Ca2?
elevations (Fig. 5e). To clarify the subunit composition of
the NMDA receptors, we further tested the effect of 10 lM
memantine, which is a very efficient inhibitor of GluN2Cand GluN2D-containing NMDA receptors. The co-application of memantine led to a significant diminishing of the

responses in control and D13–14 mice (Fig. 5g). The application of 100 lM NMDA evoked a markedly lower

the GluN3A subunit in NMDA receptors after MCAo,
which leads to lower Ca2? permeability of NMDA receptors (Perez-Otano et al. 2001; Cavara and Hollmann 2008).
The application of 100 lM glycine or 100 lM glutamate
followed the same trend as they both evoked lower responses in D13–14 cells when compared to controls
(Fig. 5g).
NMDA Receptors in GFAP/EGFP1 Glial Cells –
Ca21 Imaging Measurements In Vitro
It is well known that recordings in situ are affected by
interactions between cells, particularly by neuron-glia interactions. To address this issue, we characterized the
NMDA responses in individual GFAP/EGFP? glial cells
isolated from the somatosensory cortices of control or D1314 mice and cultured for 5–6 days. The NMDA receptor
co-agonist glycine was routinely added to the application
of NMDA at 100 lM concentration in in vitro measurements since there was no endogenous source of glycine, but
its addition did not cause any significant differences. The
kinetics of the Ca2? responses in the cultured cells was
different from those recorded in situ. In 77 %of cells, the
responses occurred within 12 s following the application of
500 lM NMDA with 100 lM glycine (95 % within 24 s),
and fast transient Ca2? spikes were not observed (Fig. 6a).
To confirm the specificity of the NMDA responses, we
used 100 lM DL-APV, which blocked the Ca2? responses
evoked by 500 lM NMDA with 100 lM glycine in all
tested cells (data not shown). The ischemic insult had a
significant impact on NMDA-evoked responses as only

1197

8.4 % of cells isolated from the injured cortical tissue of
D13–14 mice responded to the application of 500 lM
NMDA with 100 lM glycine compared to 33.5 % of cells
isolated from controls (Fig. 6b). The diminished intracellular Ca2? elevations after NMDA application observed
in situ in post-ischemic GFAP/EGFP? glial cells were thus
preserved even after 5-6 days of in vitro cultivation. Since
in vitro Ca2? imaging enabled the measurement of Ca2?
responses from single cells at much better resolution than
in situ, in large ramified cells we observed that the responses to the application of 500 lM NMDA with 100 lM
glycine did not occur uniformly in all of the processes, but
were present in only some of the processes (Fig. 6c).

Discussion
In the present work, we have shown that post-ischemic
glial cells undergo marked changes in the expression of
subunits of ionotropic as well as metabotropic glutamate
receptors. Our immunohistochemical analyses confirmed
the presence of NMDA receptor subunits in GFAP/EGFP?
glial cells, and Ca2? imaging measurements confirmed that
changes in the expression of NMDA receptor subunits are
also reflected in the functional properties of glial NMDA
receptors.
The single-cell RT-qPCR technique provided us with
information about the expression levels of 25 genes in
single GFAP/EGFP? glial cells under physiological conditions, but also following focal cerebral ischemia. Most of
the genes coding subunits of glutamate receptors increased
their expression after MCAo, and the largest increase was
observed in Grm5. This is an interesting result since the
mGluR5 receptor, coded by the Grm5 gene, is crucial in
modulating neuronal activity and in the functioning of
tripartite synapses. Our result is in accordance with a recent
study showing that the expression of Grm5 in astrocytes
was undetectable after postnatal week 3, in contrast to
Grm3 which was expressed at all developmental stages
(Sun et al. 2013). In the current work, we show that the
number of GFAP/EGFP? glial cells expressing the Grm1
and Grm3 genes did not significantly change after MCAo;
however, Grm5 became detectable in the majority of these
cells, which indicates the importance of this receptor in
post-ischemic glia. Since the activation of mGluR5 receptors was shown to result in glutamate, ATP and/or Dserine release from glial cells, they might modulate neuronal activity in the post-ischemic brain (Haydon and
Carmignoto 2006). However, mGluR5 receptors were also
shown to modulate the expression and function of glutamate transporters in glia and thus participate in regulating
extracellular glutamate concentration (Aronica et al. 2003;
Vermeiren et al. 2005; D’Antoni et al. 2008). Another

Note that Ca2? elevations were not detected in all of the processes

interesting result was regarding the Gria2 gene, which was
present in 61 % of control cells, a result that did not significantly change after MCAo. This subunit is crucial for
Ca2? permeability of AMPA receptors as its presence
markedly diminishes their Ca2? permeability (Hollmann
et al. 1991; Burnashev et al. 1992). As for the NMDA
receptors, the presence of genes coding NMDA receptor
subunits was increased in cells after MCAo when compared to controls. The role of NMDA receptors in glial
cells is still not fully elucidated, and our data might contribute to unraveling their function, which is presumably
also involved in CNS pathologies, such as ischemia or
tumors (Aronica et al. 2001). One of their possible roles
could be the activation of survival signaling pathways
(Hetman and Kharebava 2006) or, as recently shown, astrocytic NMDA receptors can control the exocytosis of
gliotransmitters and thus control synaptic transmission and
plasticity (Lalo et al. 2014). It is also worth noting that
there were 356 cells that expressed at least one gene coding
a NMDA receptor subunit in our study, and 236 of them
did not express the Grin1 gene encoding the GluN1 subunit, which according to current knowledge is obligatory in
NMDA receptor formation. A similar result was reported

by Cahoy and colleagues, who reported the presence of
Grin2c and Grin3a but the absence of Grin1 in cortical
astrocytes (Cahoy et al. 2008). This might be due to the
high protein stability of the GluN1 subunit compared to the
GluN2-3 subunits as previously reported (Atlason et al.
2007). Moreover, there are indications that murine NMDA
receptors can be also co-assembled without the GluN1
subunit (Perez-Otano et al. 2001; Matsuda et al. 2003), but
their functional properties are debatable.
The division of control, D7, and D14 cells into three
subpopulations according to their gene expression showed
that D7 and especially D14 cells have the highest relative
expression of most of the genes coding subunits of glutamate receptors (subpopulation SP3), which distinguishes
them from control cells. However, in subpopulation SP2,
formed mainly by D7 but also by D14 cells, the relative
expression of glutamate receptor subunits is lower, indicating that cells after MCAo are not homogeneous.
Interesting results were obtained from the Spearman
correlation coefficient analysis between genes in control,
D7, and D14 cells. Since we used a GFAP/EGFP? glial cell
population in this study, which among astrocytic markers
expressed also NG2 glial markers in some cells, we were

123

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:1187–1202

able to study the correlations between particular genes
coding glutamate receptor subunits with genes coding
markers of astrocytes and NG2 glia. Most of the AMPA
receptors are heterotetrameric, consisting of two GluA2
and two GluA1, GluA3, or GluA4 subunits. Since Gria2
correlated positively with astrocytic and NG2 glial markers, our results indicate that the presence of AMPA receptors is without any preference to these markers. An
interesting situation was observed in D14 cells, since Gria3
positively correlated with astrocytic markers, indicating
AMPA receptors of GluA2/GluA3 type in these cells, and
Gria4 correlated with NG2 glial markers, indicating
AMPA receptors of GluA2/GluA4 type in these cells
(Fig. 3). Several studies have shown that astrocytes possess
kainate receptors (Seifert and Steinhäuser 2001; BrandSchieber et al. 2004), which we also showed in the current
work. Moreover, our results suggest that genes coding
kainate receptor subunits correlated mostly with those
GFAP/EGFP? cells that expressed NG2 glial markers,
which would also confirm the results of a study demonstrating functional kainate receptors in NG2 glia (Kukley
and Dietrich 2009; Haberlandt et al. 2011). In D7 cells, we
observed a large positive correlation with astrocytic
markers, but in D14 cells, most of the genes coding kainate
receptor subunits again positively correlated with NG2
glial markers. An interesting correlation pattern was observed with genes coding NMDA receptor subunits. In
control cells, these genes positively correlated mostly with
NG2 glial markers; only Grin1 and Grin2c were also
partially correlated with astrocytic markers. In D7 cells, the
number of NMDA subunits correlating with NG2 glial
markers was reduced, and their correlation with astrocytic
markers was increased. The most intriguing correlation
pattern was found in D14 cells, where cells expressing
NG2 glial markers were positively correlated with Grin1
and Grin3a and moreover negatively correlated with
Grin2a-d. This strongly indicates that 14 days after MCAo,
the composition of NMDA receptors in the NG2 glial
markers expressing GFAP/EGFP? cells is of the GluN1/
GluN3A type. On the other hand, Grin2a-d genes were
positively correlated with astrocytic markers. As for the
metabotropic glutamate receptors, control cells expressing
astrocytic markers seemed to possess mGluR3 receptors
but not mGluR1, whereas genes coding both of these receptors also partially correlated with NG2 glial markers.
This situation changed completely in D14 cells, where
genes coding metabotropic glutamate receptors positively
correlated with astrocytic and negatively with NG2 glial
markers.
To study glutamate receptors also on the protein level,
we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of the
entire set of the 7 currently known NMDA receptor subunits of GFAP/EGFP? glial cells in the adult mouse cortex.

To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the
first immunohistochemical evidence that GFAP/EGFP?
glial cells in the cortex possess GluN3A subunits, which
has previously been discussed in many works (Verkhratsky
and Kirchhoff 2007; Palygin et al. 2011; Kehoe et al.
2013). Under control conditions, we did not observe
GFAP/EGFP? cells positive for any NMDA receptor
subunit, apart from GluN3A. This might be due to the fact
that under control conditions, astrocytes have a bushy-like
morphology with many fine processes. It was previously
shown by electron microscopy that the GluN1 and
GluN2A/B NMDA receptor subunits are present in astrocytes especially in the processes and not in the cellular
bodies (Conti et al. 1996). The fluorescent immunohistochemical method is not able to distinguish NMDA receptor
subunit positivity in fine processes from the background
signal. On the other hand, reactive astrocytes present in the
cortices of GFAP/EGFP mice 14 days after MCAo have a
fibrous morphology with sharp edges separating them from
the surrounding tissue, which enables the detection of
positive staining for NMDA receptor subunits in these
cells. Our immunohistochemical analysis clearly showed
the positivity of cortical GFAP/EGFP? cells for the GluN1,
GluN2B-D, and GluN3A subunits 14 days after MCAo,
which indicates the importance of NMDA receptors in glial
cells under ischemic conditions. The GluN2A subunit was
detected in cells that morphologically resembled neurons,
but not in GFAP/EGFP? cells. Since the single-cell RTqPCR results indicate that GFAP/EGFP? cells should
contain this subunit, we hypothesize that it was not detected due to some post-translational modifications of the
GluN2A protein or miRNA regulation, which might be
specific to glia. In summary, the immunohistochemical
analysis confirmed the presence of NMDA receptor subunits in GFAP/EGFP? glial cells, especially after ischemia.
The NMDA receptors in GFAP/EGFP? glial cells were
also subjected to functional study utilizing a Ca2? imaging
technique. Calcium responses to the application of 100 lM
NMDA were delayed in situ by *30 s on average, as also
reported in other studies (Serrano et al. 2008; Serrano et al.
2006; Porter and McCarthy 1995). We attribute this delay
to the slow diffusion of NMDA in the brain tissue, which is
supported by the fact that there were immediate responses
in cultivated cells. There have been several studies showing
a TTX-mediated partial reduction of NMDA-evoked responses (Schipke et al. 2001; Serrano et al. 2006, 2008).
Similar to a study of oligodendrocytic NMDA receptors
(Káradóttir et al. 2005), we did not observe any significant
changes associated with the use of TTX, which might also
be due to the fact that our application was relatively short
and locally focused, in contrast to the above-mentioned
studies showing a TTX-mediated effect (bath application
for several minutes). As for the subunit composition of the

123

1200

NMDA receptors, our results suggest a tri-heteromeric
composition of the GluN1/GluN2C/GluN3A type. This is
supported by the weak Mg2? block observed for NMDA
receptors containing the GluN3A subunit (Sasaki et al.
2002; Kehoe et al. 2013), as we observed Ca2? elevations
in aCSF that contained Mg2? without the need for cell
depolarization. Based on our single-cell RT-qPCR (Fig. 1)
and immunohistochemical analyses (Fig. 4) showing low
mRNA levels of Grin3b and the absence of GluN3B immunoreactivity, we do not assume the inclusion of the
GluN3B subunit in the NMDA receptors. Di-heteromeric
GluN1/GluN3A receptors have, however, no binding site
for glutamate or NMDA, so the inclusion of the GluN2
subunit is also needed. Our data with memantine, which is
an efficient inhibitor of GluN2C and GluN2D subunits
(Kotermanski and Johnson 2009), suggest the incorporation
of one of these subunits as well. Based on our single-cell
RT-qPCR data, which show much higher expression of
Grin2c in comparison to Grin2d in controls (Fig. 1), we
suppose that at least in controls, the NMDA receptors
contain mainly the GluN2C subunit. Nonetheless, we
cannot exclude the possibility that GFAP/EGFP? glial cells
also possess GluN1/GluN2 NMDA receptors. We hypothesize that these could provide an amplification of the
Ca2? signal upon local depolarization, which would release
the Mg2? block. The application of NBQX and PPADS did
not support the hypothesis that this local depolarization
would be provided via AMPA, Kainate, or P2X receptors.
Both in situ and in vitro experiments showed that the
application of NMDA evoked significantly lower Ca2?
elevations in GFAP/EGFP? glial cells 13–14 days after
MCAo when compared to control cells, which we hypothesize is due to the increased involvement of the
GluN3A subunit as shown by our single-cell RT-qPCR
and immunohistochemical analyses. The decreased Ca2?
permeability of NMDA receptors can be further caused by
the incorporation of the GluN2D subunit in NMDA receptors (Burnashev et al. 1995; Paoletti 2011; Evans et al.
2012), which was also highly upregulated 14 days after
MCAo. Another reason for decreased Ca2? permeability
of NMDA receptors might be their internalization, which
was shown to be regulated by the particular subunit
compositions (Lavezzari et al. 2004), and, for example,
GluN3A internalization is regulated via phosphorylation of
a tyrosine residue (Y971) within the GluN3A intracellular
C-terminal tail (Chowdhury et al. 2013). Therefore, we
cannot completely rule out the possibility that NMDA
receptors in GFAP/EGFP? glial cells are internalized or
inactivated by the Ca2?-calmodulin complex after MCAo
(Ehlers et al. 1996). Interestingly, the Ca2? permeability
of astrocytic NMDA receptors after ischemia is regionspecific, since as shown by Krebs and colleagues, acutely

123

Cell Mol Neurobiol (2015) 35:1187–1202

isolated hippocampal astrocytes displayed NMDA-evoked
Ca2? elevations 20 days after global cerebral ischemia
(Krebs et al. 2003). The number of cells responding to the
application of 100 lM glutamate in situ was also decreased after MCAo, but some Ca2? influx was still detected, which is probably due to the presence of Ca2?permeable non-NMDA glutamate receptors. These could
be ionotropic AMPA or kainate glutamate receptors
(Burnashev et al. 1992), but also metabotropic mGluR5
glutamate receptors coded by the Grm5 gene, which becomes strongly expressed in D14 cells and which mediates
intracellular calcium elevations by releasing calcium from
intracellular stores (Nakahara et al. 1997). In vitro cultivated GFAP/EGFP? glial cells isolated from young adult
mice enabled us to study NMDA-evoked responses in
detail. Calcium imaging measurements revealed that the
responses were process-specific, which corresponds with
recent studies showing microdomains within astrocytic
territories (Shigetomi et al. 2013). Moreover, this suggests
that the response rates in our in situ experiments might be
slightly underestimated since we recorded a signal only
from the cellular body and not from the processes, where
the responses probably originate (Schipke et al. 2001).
The results obtained by Ca2? imaging measurements thus
supplement the data from single-cell RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical analysis and underline the changes of
NMDA receptors in post-ischemic GFAP/EGFP?glial
cells.
In summary, our study provides an overall picture of
ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptor expression in cortical GFAP/EGFP? glial cells. We show how
the expression of particular subunits of these receptors
changes after focal cerebral ischemia. On the functional
level, we further show that NMDA-mediated Ca2?
elevations significantly decrease after ischemia in GFAP/
EGFP? glial cells, which is presumably due to the involvement of the GluN3A subunit. We believe that our
study thus adds a new piece of the puzzle to the picture,
from which we will eventually understand all of the
complex processes, including neuron-glia interaction or
glutamate-mediated signaling, in glial cells and which
might serve as a guide for research into precisely targeted
therapeutics.
