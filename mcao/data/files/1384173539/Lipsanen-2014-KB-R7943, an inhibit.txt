Remote areas connected to cortical infarcts, such as the thalamus, are affected by stroke due to delayed
retrograde degeneration of afferent connections. This is temporally associated with the accumulation of
␤-amyloid (A␤) and calcium. Here we tested a hypothesis that prevention of excessive Ca2+ inﬂux into
the axoplasm via the reverse Na+ /Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) would provide axonal protection and eventually
lessen the A␤ and calcium load in the thalamus. We found that chronic treatment with a speciﬁc inhibitor
of the reverse NCX, KB-R7943 (30 mg/kg once daily, 27 days) after middle cerebral artery occlusion did
not prevent atypical secondary pathology in the thalamus or improve functional outcome. The present
data do not support a role for reverse NCX activity in the complex pathology within the thalamus after
cerebral ischemia.

1. Introduction
Secondary pathology in the thalamus after cerebral ischemia
includes several features intriguingly similar to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (see [1]). The most striking similarity is the accumulation
of ␤-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and ␤-amyloid (A␤) or their
fragments in dense, plaque-like extracellular deposits in the thalamus in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) [2]. We have also demonstrated that APP processing and
the expression of A␤-degrading enzymes are altered in MCAO rats
[3]. Interestingly, calcium seems to aggregate from small diffuse
granules to large deposits in overlapping areas [4].

Intracellular and axonal calcium levels are effectively controlled
by sodium–calcium channels (NCX). NCX is a nine transmembrane
segment protein that is widely distributed in the brain [5]. It functions in a bidirectional way, coupling the movement of Ca2+ and
Na+ ions across the cell membrane in the CNS. NCX has also been
found in the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope and has
been proposed to mediate Ca2+ ﬂux between the nucleoplasm and
the nuclear envelope [6] and then to the ER [7]. NCXs are presented in three different forms (NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3). NCX3 is
mostly present in subpopulations of neurons, where it is localized predominantly in dendrites and distal astrocyte processes
that contact excitatory synapses [8]. In the cerebral cortical areas,
the NCX1 isoforms are highly expressed in pyramidal neurons of
layers III–V. NCX1 protein is mainly detected in the hippocampus, in the hypothalamus, in the substantia nigra, in the ventral
tegmental area, and in the granular layer of the cerebellum, NCX2

174

is expressed mainly in somatosensory cortical areas, but also in
the hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus, and NCX3 protein
is found particularly in the hippocampal subregions and in the
ventral striatum and cerebellar molecular layer [5]. Interestingly,
transcription of the NCX1 gene is controlled by three separate promoters and it is independent of calcium levels, but in contrast, the
NCX2 and NCX3 genes are strictly dependent on calcium levels,
although in different and reverse manners (see [9]).
Under normal conditions, NCX provides the main pathway
for calcium efﬂux, but it can also act in reverse order, causing
Ca2+ inﬂux particularly during ischemia, strong depolarization and
augmented intracellular sodium concentration [10]. Continuous
reverse mode NCX activation leads to an increase in axoplasmal
Ca2+ and in turn activation of several degenerative pathways (see
[11]). In line with this, inhibitors of reverse mode NCX are effective
in protecting axons against anoxia and ischemia in vitro and in vivo
[12–14].
The nonselective calcium channel blocker, bepridil, prevents
harmful intra-axonal calcium accumulation [15]. More interestingly, chronic bepridil treatment signiﬁcantly decreases calcium
and soluble A␤40 /A␤42 levels in the ipsilateral thalamus of MCAO
rats [16] and mice after cortical photothrombosis [17]. Since
bepridil has a broad pharmacological proﬁle including inhibition of
the reverse mode of NCX, we hypothesized that the more selective
inhibitor, KB-R7943 [18–20], would prevent delayed retrograde
degeneration of thalamocortical connections, lessen Ca2+ overload
and A␤ burden in the thalamus, and lead eventually to improved
behavioral outcome in MCAO rats. KB-R7943 was initially developed for the treatment of cardiac arrest, but has recently been
shown to protect against ischemic injury in the central nervous
system [21,22].
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Forty-ﬁve male Wistar rats (age 2–3 months, weight 276–348 g)
from the Laboratory Animal Centre, Kuopio, were subjected to
either MCAO (n = 35) or sham operation (n = 10). The rats were
housed under 12:12 h light/dark conditions in a temperaturecontrolled environment (20 ± 1 ◦ C). Food and water were available
ad libitum. All animal procedures were approved by the Animal
Ethics Committee (Hämeenlinna, Finland) and conducted in accordance with guidelines set by the European Community Council
Directives 86/609/EEC. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and to ensure their welfare throughout.

MCAO controls (MCAO + VEH) (n = 8) and MCAO + KB-R7943
(30 mg/kg p.o., once daily, n = 9). KB-R7943 (2-[2-[4-(4nitrobenzyloxy)phenyl]ethyl]isothiourea
mesylate)
(Tocris
Bioscience, Bristol, UK) was dissolved ﬁrst in DMSO (dimethyl
sulfoxide; Sigma-Aldrich, Seelze, Germany; ﬁnal volume 5%) and
then in a mixture of Arabic gum (5% solution in distilled water,
Sigma, St. Louis, USA). The drug dose was selected on the basis
of previous studies [14,25]. The drug treatment was started on
postoperative day 2 to avoid interference with the maturation
of acute ischemic damage. Sham-operated animals (n = 10) were
treated with vehicle.
2.4. Behavioral assessments
The behavioral tests selected for this study are sensitive to
the detection of treatment effects and are minimally affected by
repeated testing. In MCAO rats, a spontaneous recovery of function
is typically observed in the limb-placing test, whereas the sensorimotor impairment is more permanent in the cylinder test applied.
All behavioral tests and analyses were carried out in a blinded manner.
A modiﬁed version of the limb-placing test was used to assess
hindlimb and forelimb responses to tactile and proprioceptive
stimulation [24,26]. The rats were habituated for handling and
tested before ischemia induction and on postoperative days 2, 14,
and 28 (Fig. 1). The test consisted of seven limb-placing tasks. Tactile stimulation was elicited by contacting the tested limb with table
surface and proprioceptive stimulation was made by pulling down
the tested limb (i.e., limb position in space). The following scores
were used to detect impairment of the forelimb and hindlimb
function: 2 points, the rat performed normally; 1 point, the rat performed with a delay of more than 2 s and/or incompletely; 0 points,
the rat did not perform normally. The maximum score was 14. Both
sides of the body were tested.
The cylinder test was used to assess the imbalance between use
of the impaired and non-impaired forelimbs [27]. For the test, the
rat was placed in a transparent cylinder (Ø 20 cm) and videotaped.
The test was done during the light hours of the light/dark cycle. A
mirror was placed at a 45◦ angle beneath the cylinder so that behavior could be ﬁlmed from below the cylinder. Exploratory activity
was analyzed by using a video recorder with slow motion capabilities. The numbers of cylinder contacts made by both forelimbs
and by either the impaired or unimpaired forelimb were counted.
The cylinder test was carried out one day before the MCAO operation and on postoperative days 14 and 28. The cylinder score
for an impaired forelimb was calculated as: [(contralateral contacts + 1/2 × bilateral contacts)/total contacts] × 100%.

2.2. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
2.5. Preparation of tissue samples
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by the intraluminal ﬁlament technique [23] under halothane anesthesia. After 90 min of
MCA occlusion, the ﬁlament was removed and the external carotid
artery was permanently closed by electrocoagulation. The shamoperated rats were treated in a similar manner except that the
ﬁlament was not inserted. Buprenorﬁne (0.03 mg/kg, s.c.) was used
to relieve postoperative pain. In addition, postoperative care of
MCAO rats included supplemental 0.9% NaCl (i.p.) and softened food
pellets to prevent weight loss.

The ipsilateral and contralateral thalamus of each MCAO or
sham-operated rat was mechanically homogenized in 400 ␮l of
Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, Lonza) on ice. A 10fold excess of PBS/mg tissue was used. The homogenates were
subdivided into two equal fractions: the ﬁrst one was suspended
in DPBS containing EDTA-free protease and phosphatase inhibitors
(1:100; Thermo Scientiﬁc) (homogenate I); and the second one was
suspended in DPBS without inhibitors (homogenate II). Aliquots
were stored at −70 ◦ C.

2.3. Study design and drug treatment
2.6. Soluble Aˇ measurements
Two days after the operation, a modiﬁed version of the limbplacing test [24] was used to verify successful MCAO (Fig. 1). Only
the rats with a total score less than 10 were included in the study.
Based on the limb-placing scores on postoperative day
two, MCAO animals were assigned to equal groups of

Total protein I samples were ultracentrifuged (100,000 × g, 50.4
Ti rotor; Beckman) for 2 h at 4 ◦ C. Soluble A␤40 and A␤42 levels were
measured from the supernatant (soluble fraction) using monoclonal and HRP-conjugated antibody-based human/rat ␤ amyloid

Fig. 1. Study design. Rats were habituated to handling and behavioral testing before baseline assessment. Two days after MCAO, rats were assigned to behaviorally equal
treatment groups based on the limb placing test results. Rats were treated daily for 27 days with KB-R7943 (30 mg/kg, p.o., once daily) or vehicle, with treatment starting on
postoperative day 2. Sensorimotor impairment was assessed using the limb placing test and the cylinder test. Rats were sacriﬁced for biochemical analyses on postoperative
day 29.

the follow-up (p < 0.05). MCAO groups did not differ from each
other (MCAO + VEH vs. MCAO + KB-R7943: at baseline—14 ± 0 vs.
14 ± 0; on post-operative day 2—6.5 ± 1.2 vs. 6.1 ± 1.7; on postoperative day 14—10.7 ± 2.2 vs. 10.1 ± 1.2, and on post-operative
day 28—11.5 ± 1.8 vs. 12.0 ± 1.0, Fig. 2B).

2.7. Calcium measurements

3.3. Cylinder test

Tissue homogenate samples (25 ␮l) were digested (CEM
MDS–2000 microwave digestor) in 100 ␮l of suprapur nitric acid
(Merck). After digestion, 1375 ␮l of 0.2% lanthanum solution (Riedel
de Haen) was added and the samples were diluted to a volume of
1.5 ml with Milli-Q water. Calcium measurements were carried out
on a ZEEnit 700 atomic absorption spectrometer with a calcium hollow cathode lamp at wavelength 422.7 nm using an air-acetylene
ﬂame and SFS6 injection module. Calcium concentrations were normalized to tissue weights in each sample.

Spontaneous forelimb use was determined by the cylinder test.
There was a signiﬁcant overall group effect in spontaneous forelimb use. This was explained by a severe impairment in MCAO rats
compared to sham-operated rats. KB-R7943 treatment did not have
an effect compared to vehicle treated MCAO rats (MCAO + VEH vs.
MCAO + KB-R7943: at baseline—48.9 ± 9.0 vs. 49.8 ± 5.5; on postoperative day 14—22.1 ± 8.9 vs. 27.5 ± 9.8; and on post-operative
day 28—24.6 ± 10.6 vs. 36.1 ± 13.2, Fig. 2C).

2.8. Statistical analyses

3.4. Calcium levels increased in the ipsilateral thalamus 29 days
after MCAO

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version
19.0. Differences in the limb placing scores between experimental
groups were analyzed by Mann–Whitney U-tests. Non-parametric
Mann–Whitney U-tests (equal variances not assumed) and oneway ANOVA with post-hoc tests (LSD) were used for statistical
analysis of biochemical and cylinder data. Values are indicated as
mean ± 95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI). The level of statistical
signiﬁcance was set to p < 0.05.

Biochemical analyses showed a robust increase in calcium
levels in the ipsilateral thalamus after the ischemic insult. KBR7943 treatment did not decrease calcium load in MCAO rats
(MCAO + VEH: 6.1 ± 2.4 vs. MCAO + KB-R7943: 3.4 ± 1.2 ␮g/␮l/g;
Fig. 2D). Neither A␤40 (MCAO + VEH: 38.7 ± 6.2 vs. MCAO + KBR7943: 35.0 ± 4.7 pmol/␮g, Fig. 2E) nor A␤42 (MCAO + VEH:
3.7 ± 2.9 vs. MCAO + KB-R7943: 3.3 ± 1.0 pmol/␮g, Fig. 2F) levels in
the ipsilateral thalamus differed in the MCAO treatment groups.

3. Results

4. Discussion

3.1. Mortality and adverse effects

Focal cerebral ischemia leads to secondary neuronal death
and atypical pathology in the thalamus as a result of retrograde
degeneration of thalamocortical neurons [28–30]. Neither the
mechanisms underlying the degenerative process, nor ways to prevent the pathology, have been clearly identiﬁed. Nevertheless, this
is a potential drug target with an extended therapeutic time window [31]. Here we showed that a speciﬁc inhibitor of the reverse
Na+ /Ca2+ exchanger, KB-R7943, did not lessen secondary pathology or display functional beneﬁt in MCAO rats. The reverse NCX
is the major pathway for calcium inﬂux under ischemia/hypoxia
[20,32] and thus inhibition of calcium entry may be neuroprotective against primary ischemic damage [33]. In addition, there is both
in vitro [34] and in vivo [14] evidence that blocking the reverse
NCX provides axonal protection. However, in regions with sufﬁcient ATP levels, NCX inhibition may paradoxically promote further
cell damage [35]. This, together with the lack of speciﬁcity of NCX
inhibitors available at present, has produced somewhat conﬂicting
literature [36–38]. Consistent with our previous studies [2,4], biochemical analyses showed a robust increase in thalamic calcium
and A␤42 levels after MCAO indicating severely impaired calcium
homeostasis and/or APP processing. Previously, we have shown
that bepridil (possibly partly through the reverse NCX) mitigates

From 35 rats, three rats died within 48 h after operation. Three
MCAO animals died during the treatment (two MCAO + VEH, one
MCAO + KB-R7943). Twelve MCAO animals scored over 10 points in
the limb-placing test on postoperative day two and were excluded
from the study. Only the animals that survived through the whole
study were included in the analyses of the results.
During the course of the study, the animals were observed
and weighed daily. MCAO rats lost weight during the ﬁrst postoperative days (28%; Fig. 2A). In addition, at later time points
KB-R7943 treatment seemed to decrease body weight. At the end
of the study, KB-R7943 treated animals weighed on average 25%
less than the sham-operated animals. Vehicle treated MCAO rats
weighed 13% less than sham-operated animals by the end of the
follow-up.
3.2. Limb placing test
The limb placing test showed that MCAO rats were initially
severely impaired followed by partial recovery. There was a signiﬁcant difference between sham-operated and MCAO rats throughout

176

Fig. 2. Chronic KB-R7943 treatment after MCAO did not have a beneﬁcial effect on functional recovery and it did not change calcium, A␤40 or A␤42 levels in the ipsilateral
thalamus. The rats were weighed daily during the follow-up (A). KB-R7943 treated animals gained weight slower than vehicle-treated MCAO animals. Sensorimotor limb
placing (B) or cylinder (C) behavioral tests did not reveal differences between the MCAO groups. Twenty-nine days after MCAO, calcium (D), soluble A␤40 (E) and A␤42 (F)
levels were measured from the ipsilateral and contralateral thalamus in MCAO rats. An overall group effect was observed in the calcium levels, which was explained by the
difference between sham-operated and ischemic animals. KB-R7943 treatment did not change the load in any of the measured agents compared to vehicle treated MCAO
rats. Values are mean ±95% CI.

both calcium and A␤ pathology in the thalamus after focal cerebral ischemia [16,17]. Since KB-R7943 was not able to reverse the
secondary pathology, bepridil may exert [39] its effects independently from calcium channels, as suggested by Mitterreiter et al.
[40]. Also, it is possible that thalamic retrograde degeneration and
the secondary pathology of ischemia do not involve the operation
of reverse NCX.
Given the important role of the thalamus in sensorimotor information ﬂow, it is likely that the secondary pathology also affects
the behavior of ischemic animals. The extent of thalamic atrophy
in MCAO rats has been demonstrated to correlate with the late
sensory deﬁcits revealed through the adhesive-removal test and in
other tests measuring skilled forelimb function [41,42]. In line with
this, prevention of thalamic pathology/atrophy by pharmacotherapy alleviates sensorimotor impairment [16,43]. The behavioral
tests that we used to follow functional impairment and recovery
after MCAO did not show any treatment effect, which is consistent
with the biochemical data. When interpreting the results, however, several technical issues have to be taken into consideration.
First, KB-R7943 was difﬁcult to dissolve and thus dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to help in making ﬁnal solution. Whether
DMSO has any detrimental effect is not known. Interestingly, there
is evidence that DMSO is neuroprotective against ischemic damage
[44]. In our study all animals were given DSMO and thus it should
not bias the data. Second, the administration dose (30 mg/kg, per
os) was selected based on the on the previous studies indicating
axonal protection after experimental ischemia [14] and behavioral
improvements after acute seizure [25]. One should note, that the

used KB-R7943 dose seemed to induce some side-effects (e.g., loss
of body weight and hypothermia [36]), which may mask part of
therapeutic effects. Another technical issue is whether KB-R7943
is able to cross the blood–brain barrier. However, several lines of
evidence support this notion: the oral bioavailability of KB-R7943
is high, as a lipophilic compound it should cross the blood–brain
barrier which already leaks because of ischemic event [45], and
opening of the blood–brain barrier is prolonged by KB-R7943 [46].
In conclusion, the complex secondary pathology in the thalamus
following cerebral ischemia includes continuous neurodegenerative processes, A␤ deposition, and impaired calcium homeostasis,
which are all intriguingly similar to the pathology seen in
Alzheimer’s disease. The present data do not support a role for
reverse NCX activity in these processes. Further studies are, however, needed to improve our understanding on the effects of NCX
inhibitors in pathological conditions affecting the brain.
