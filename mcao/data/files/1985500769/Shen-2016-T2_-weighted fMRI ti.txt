Abstract
T2*-weighted MRI of transient oxygen challenge (OC) showed exaggerated OC percent changes in the ischemic tissue at
risk compared to normal tissue. One ambiguity is that regions with high vascular density also showed exaggerated OC
percent changes. This study explored time-to-peak (TTP) of the OC percent changes to improve the utility of
T2*-weighted OC MRI. Experiments were performed longitudinally at 30 min, 150 min and 24 h after transient
(60-min) stroke in rats. Ischemic core, normal, and mismatch tissue were classified pixel-by-pixel based on apparent
diffusion coefficient and cerebral blood flow. Major findings were: (i) Delayed OC TTP was localized to and corresponded well with the perfusion-diffusion mismatch. (ii) By contrast, the exaggerated OC percent changes were less
localized, with changes not only in the at-risk tissue but also in some areas of the contralesional hemisphere with venous
vessel origins. (iii) The OC time-course of the mismatch tissue was biphasic, with a faster initial increase followed by a
slower increase. (iv) At-risk tissue with delayed TTP and exaggerated OC was normal after reperfusion and the at-risk
tissue was mostly (83  18%) rescued by reperfusion as indicated by normal 24-h T2. OC TTP offers unique information
toward better characterization of at-risk tissue in ischemic stroke.

Introduction
Improved identiﬁcation of potentially salvageable atrisk ischemic tissue is clinically important. Perfusiondiﬀusion MRI has been instrumental in distinguishing
reversible from irreversibly ischemic brain injury, and
to guide acute stroke treatment in preclinical and clinical settings.1 However, it remains challenging for
perfusion and diﬀusion MRI to separate oligemia, penumbra or ischemic core.
T2*-weighted MRI of transient oxygen challenge
(OC) has been shown to oﬀer additional information
on ischemic tissue at risk in permanent2,3 and transient4,5 stroke rats and in stroke patients.6 In the ischemic
penumbra in which cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) is partially compromised but still has signiﬁcant metabolic
activity, the basal T2*-weighted signal intensity is low
due to the relatively high concentration of deoxyhemoglobin. OC brings in oxygenated blood displacing the
high deoxyhemoglobin concentration in the at-risk
tissue surrounding the infarct core, resulting in an
exaggerated OC T2*-weighted signal intensity percent
changes compared to the homologous region in the

contralesional hemisphere. In the infarct core during
occlusion, OC induces little or no change in
T2*-weighted signal intensity because occlusion completely compromises CBF. Thus, OC percent-change
map highlight at-risk tissue with high contrast amongst

its surrounding in ischemic stroke. Regions with exaggerated OC responses are consistent with the notion of
ischemic penumbra, as demonstrated by histologic evidence of normal neuronal morphology, ongoing glucose metabolism, and tissue recovery after
reperfusion.5,7–9 OC with reduced oxygen concentration (40% O2) to minimize possible toxic eﬀects of
oxygen has also been proposed.10,11 Basal T1 increased
slightly in the ischemic core 24 h after stroke due to
edema, whereas OC decreased T1 signiﬁcantly in the
core, indicating the substantial increases in dissolved
oxygen occurred in the core as the results of hyperperfusion 24 h after stroke.5
Although OC oﬀer useful insight into ischemic tissue
fate, the OC T2*-weighted signals have a few confounding factors that preclude potential widespread utility. A
key confound is that regions with high vascular density
also showed exaggerated OC percent changes, making
it challenging to distinguish these changes from the
exaggerated OC percent changes of at-risk tissue. In
this study, we explored the utility of time to peak
(TTP) of the exaggerated OC responses to further
improve its potential diagnostic value. Experiments
were performed on transient (60-min) cerebral ischemia
in rats. The ischemic core, normal, and mismatch tissues were classiﬁed pixel-by-pixel using automated cluster analysis of apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient (ADC) and
CBF. OC percent changes and TTP were analyzed.
These changes are monitored longitudinally at multiple
time points after stroke.

isoﬂurane in air during surgery. Transient (60-min)
focal brain ischemia of the right hemisphere was
induced using the intraluminal middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) method.12 Animals were mechanically ventilated and maintained at 1.2% isoﬂurane
during MRI. End-tidal CO2 was monitored via a
Surgivet capnometer (Smith Medical, Waukesha, WI,
USA). Noninvasive end-tidal CO2 values have been
calibrated previously against invasive blood gas samplings under identical settings.13 The rectal temperature
was maintained at 37.0  0.5 C. The heart rate and
blood oxygen saturation level were monitored using a
MouseOx system (STARR Life Science Corp.,
Oakmont, PA, USA).
Magnetic resonance imaging was performed during
occlusion and animals were moved out on the rail to
withdraw the occluder while the animals were in the
holder at 60 min after occlusion. The animals were
repositioned for additional MRI. Quantitative CBF
and ADC were acquired every 30 min post-occlusion
up to 180 min, and again at 24 h after stroke.
Transient oxygen challenge (inhaling oxygen) was performed at 45 min, 150 min and 24 h post-occlusion. T2*weighted MRI data were continuously acquired during
which the animals breathed 3 min of air, 4 min of O2,
and 3 min of air. Rats were imaged at 24 h post-occlusion and T2 maps were acquired to conﬁrm infarct
volume.

MRI experiments
MRI experiments were performed on a 7-T/40-cm
magnet, a Biospec Bruker console (Billerica, MA),
and a 40-G/cm gradient insert (ID ¼ 12 cm, 120 -s
rise time). A surface coil (2.3-cm ID) was used for
brain imaging and a neck coil for perfusion labeling.13,14 Coil-to-coil electromagnetic interaction was
actively decoupled.
ADC: Averaged ADC was obtained by averaging
three ADC maps with diﬀusion-sensitive gradients
separately applied along the x, y or z direction.
Single-shot, spin-echo echo-planar images (EPI) were
acquired15 with matrix ¼ 96  96 with partial Fourier
(5/8) acquisition and reconstructed to 128  128,
FOV ¼ 2.56  2.56 cm, seven 1.5-mm slices, TR ¼ 3 s
(90o ﬂip angle), TE ¼ 37 ms, b ¼ 4 and 1200 s/mm2,
 ¼ 17.53 ms, d ¼ 5.6 ms, and 16 averages.
CBF: CBF was measured using the continuous arterial spin-labeling (cASL) technique with single-shot, gradient-echo, echo-planar-imaging (EPI) acquisition as
described previously.15 Continuous arterial spin labeling employed a 2.7-s square radiofrequency pulse to the
labeling coil. Acquisition parameters were matrix ¼

was: 3 min OFF, 4 min ON, 3 min OFF, and 60 repetitions in total.

(50 and 80 ms), TR ¼ 2 s (90 ﬂip angle), matrix ¼

and eight signal averages.

Data analysis
Data analysis used codes written in Matlab (MathWorks
Inc., Natick, MA, USA) and the STIMULATE
(University of Minnesota) software. ADC, CBF and
T2 maps were calculated as described previously.12,16
OC response percent change maps with respect to
basal (air) conditions were calculated. T1 maps with
intensity in unit of seconds were calculated pixel-bypixel by ﬁtting the model of Si ¼ So2AeTI(i)/T1,
where Si is the signal intensity obtained with inversion
delay time TI(i).
Cerebrospinal ﬂuid and the corpus callosum were
excluded from analysis. Three tissue types (normal, perfusion-diﬀusion mismatch and ischemic core) were
characterized by using auto-clustering ISODATA
method17 based on 30-min ADC and CBF data without
using thresholds. Images of diﬀerent time points were
co-registered using custom-designed semi-automatic
co-registration software.15,18–20 Percent changes, ADC
and CBF values were analyzed for diﬀerent tissue types
for individual animals, followed by group averaging.
Final infarct volume was determined based on 24-h
T2 maps using threshold (mean T2 of normal hemisphere plus two standard deviations) method. To compensate for edema, a swelling factor was determined by
subtracting the total volume of the normal hemisphere
from the ischemic hemisphere.21 The edema-corrected
lesion volume was obtained by subtracting the swelling
volume from the ischemic volume.
OC percent-change and TTP maps were generated
pixel-by-pixel. The time-to-peak was deﬁned as the time
from one standard deviation above baseline to the
mean value of the steady-state OC response during
the stimulation period. For pixels with negative OC
response, TTP was assigned as 10 s. ROI analysis
was performed using an ischemic core ROI, mismatch
ROI, contralesional ROI, and other ROIs as described
in text. The group-averaged OC percent changes and
TTP (along with ADC, CBF and T2) of normal and

285
at-risk tissue, contralesional ROI, and other ROIs
with exaggerated percent changes were tabulated at different time points.
All data values in text are expressed as mean  s.d.
and in graphs as mean  s.e.m. A P < 0.05 (two-tailed
paired t-test) was taken to be statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
All recorded physiological parameters were maintained
within normal physiological ranges (end-tidal CO2:
35–45 mmHg, arterial O2 saturation: 94–97%, temperature: 36.5–37.3 C, heart rate: 350–400 bpm) unless
otherwise perturbed by OC.
Figure 1 shows the ADC, CBF, OC percent-change,
and OC TTP maps 30-mins after stroke of a representative rat during MCAO. The perfusion–diﬀusion mismatch was detected where CBF was low but ADC was
close to normal (red ROI). Consistent with previous
reports,2–5 OC percent-change map showed good correspondence between exaggerated OC response and the

OC percent-change map also showed exaggerated OC
percent changes in some regions of the contralateral
normal hemisphere (ROI1) and along the midline
(ROI2).
By contrast, the region with delayed TTP is much
more localized with excellent correspondence with the
perfusion–diﬀusion mismatch. TTP map is better visualized after setting a threshold of mean þ 2 standard

deviations of the normal hemisphere. ROI1 and ROI2
did not show delayed TTP compared to normal tissue,
and therefore could be distinguished from tissue at risk.
The group-averaged OC magnitude and TTP of
normal, at-risk and core tissue during MCAO, along
with their ADC and CBF, are shown in Figure 2.

OC percent changes were normal in the at-risk tissue
and mildly elevated in the ischemic core. The majority
of the tissue with delayed TTP did not infarct based
on 24-h T2. Figure 4(b) shows the group-averaged
ADC, CBF, OC percent-change and OC TTP values
at 150 min for the normal, mismatch (at-risk) and core
ROIs. The ADC and CBF values of the initial at-risk
tissue were mildly reduced and those of the initial
ischemic core tissue were markedly reduced.
Consistent with the individual animal data, the initial
at-risk tissue showed normal TTP and the initial core
showed mildly delayed TTP. OC percent changes were
normal in the initial at-risk tissue and mildly elevated
in the initial core.
ADC, CBF, OC percent change, OC TTP maps and
T2-weighted MRI of 24-h after MCAO are shown in
Figure 5(a) and the group-averaged ADC, CBF, OC
percent-change, OC TTP and T2 values at 24 hr for
the normal, mismatch (at-risk) and core ROIs are
shown in Figure 5(b). The initially deﬁned at-risk
tissue showed normal ADC, OC percent change, OC
TTP, trending higher CBF (p ¼ 0.13), and close to
normal T2. Based on 24-h T2, the majority
(83  18%), but not all, of the initially deﬁned atrisk tissue did not infarct at 24 h after MCAO in this
60-min MCAO model. The initially deﬁned core tissue
showed signiﬁcantly lower ADC (p ¼ 0.01), OC
percent change (p ¼ 0.02), and signiﬁcantly higher
CBF (p ¼ 0.01) and T2 (p ¼ 0.01). Because the OC
responses of core tissue at 24 h showed small negative
or positive percent changes, TTP could not be reliably
determined.

(red ROI) compared to the normal contralesional homologous region (black ROI). The post OC stimulus signals did not completely return to baseline compared to
contralesional ROI. Normalized time courses showed
the markedly delayed TTP of the mismatch tissue compared to normal tissue. Moreover, the time course of
the mismatch tissue appeared biphasic, with a faster
initial increase followed by a slower increase. The
faster component slope was 0.028 s1 and the slower
component slope was 0.008 s1, compared to the
normal tissue slope of 0.033 s1. The TTP of at-risk
tissue was longer than that of normal tissue by 30 s.
ADC and CBF values of the delayed TTP OC
responses conﬁrmed that these tissues were localized
to the perfusion–diﬀusion mismatch (low CBF and
slightly reduced ADC). The core tissue (blue ROI)
with markedly reduced ADC and CBF did not show
signiﬁcant OC percent changes. Its TTP could not be
reliably determined.
Group-averaged OC magnitude and TTP of the
normal, mismatch, ROI1 and ROI2 were compared
(Figure 3). While the mismatch ROI, ROI1 and ROI2
all showed exaggerated BOLD responses, only the mismatch ROI showed a delayed TTP compared to the
contralesional homologous ROI. ROI1 and ROI2 did
not show delayed TTP compared to normal tissue.
Reperfusion occurred at 60 min after MCAO onset.
The OC TTP and percent-change maps at 150 min
after MCAO (after reperfusion) are shown in
Figure 4(a). After reperfusion, the initially deﬁned
at-risk tissue showed normal TTP and the initially
deﬁned ischemic core showed mildly delayed TTP.

Discussion
This study explored the utility of time-to-peak of the
T2*-weighted MRI of oxygen challenge to improve
the identiﬁcation of at-risk tissue in ischemic stroke.
The major ﬁndings are: (1) Delayed OC TTP is localized to and corresponded well with the perfusion–diffusion mismatch. (2) By contrast, the exaggerated OC
percent changes were less localized, with changes not
only in the at-risk tissue but also in some areas of the
contralateral normal hemisphere and along the midline.
(3) The OC time-course of the perfusion–diﬀusion mismatch tissue appeared biphasic, with a faster initial
increase followed by a slower increase. (4) At-risk
tissue with delayed TTP and exaggerated OC was
normal after reperfusion at 60 min post MCAO and
the at-risk tissue was rescued by reperfusion as

indicated by normal T2 24 h post-MCAO. These ﬁndings suggest that OC TTP oﬀers additional information
to the exaggerated OC percent changes to improve
identiﬁcation of at-risk tissue in ischemic stroke.

Magnitude of OC responses
As described previously,2–5 T2*-weighted MRI contrast
of the oxygen challenge arises from regional changes in
local deoxyhemoglobin concentration ([Hb]) in the
brain, which is dependent on local cerebral metabolic
rate of oxygen, arterial oxygen tension, CBF and cerebral blood volume. In the ischemic penumbra, the basal
[Hb] is elevated because the tissue is still metabolically
active (therefore producing Hb) but CBF is partially
compromised. OC thus induces a signiﬁcantly larger
increase in the T2*-weighted signal intensity in at-risk

tissue than normal tissue because the denominator of
the at-risk tissue is small due to the high basal [Hb].
Quantitative analysis of possible metabolic and oxygen
concentration changes is challenging because OC signal
is dependent on many biophysical and physiological
parameters. Nonetheless, tissue with exaggerated OC
responses can be salvaged by reperfusion.5,7,8
Consistent with previous ﬁndings,2–5 the perfusion–
diﬀusion mismatch showed exaggerated OC percent
changes, and there was good correspondence between
areas of exaggerated OC percent changes and the perfusion–diﬀusion mismatch in ischemic stroke.

TTP of the OC responses
The magnitude of the exaggerated OC responses, however, is ambiguous in that there were some exaggerated
OC percent changes in the contralesional hemisphere
and along the midline. ROI1 and ROI2 in Figure 1
also showed exaggerated OC responses but without
delayed TTP. The signal sources are likely associated

with vessels. The notion that these are vessels is supported by the exaggerated OC responses from region of
high vascular density, the shape and location of these
pixels (i.e. the cortical surface and known vascular
structure in the caudate putamen). The sources of
these signals are likely venules and veins, but not
arteries because hemoglobins in the arteries are essentially fully saturated. There could be some contributions from arterioles but likely small. Note that the
temporal resolution of the TTC OC could not distinguish between arteries and veins based on the temporal
domain. The TTP in the at-risk tissue is markedly
delayed (by 30 s) relative to normal tissue as a result
of signiﬁcantly compromised tissue perfusion. TTP
returned toward normal after reperfusion.
It is also important to note that the post OC stimulus
signals did not completely return to baseline compared
to contralesional ROI. A possible explanation is
that tissue oxygenation in the at-risk tissue after transient OC challenges remains elevated to a new
steady state.

290

Biphasic OC TTP response
One of the major ﬁndings is that the OC response in the
ischemic penumbra is biphasic, with a faster initial
increase followed by a slower increase, whereas the
OC response in the normal tissue was monophasic
with a rapid rise time. A possible explanation is that
the ROI includes two diﬀerent tissue types (i.e. normal
and at-risk tissue), which have two diﬀerent TTPs.
Another possible explanation is that there are two compartments within the at-risk tissue, one of large vessels,
and the other of tissue/veins, with the latter being
markedly delayed because it takes time for oxygenated
blood to reach a new steady state where oxygen delivery
and oxygen consumption is out of balance under signiﬁcantly compromised perfusion condition. This is in
contrast to normal tissue where the oxygen delivery and
consumption is already in optimal steady state. T2*weighted MRI of OC could oﬀer valuable data to
model oxygen transport into ischemic tissue at risk
with additional measurements such as cerebral blood
volume. Further investigation is needed.

After reperfusion and endpoints
After reperfusion, the at-risk tissue showed normal
TTP and the ischemic core showed mildly delayed
TTP, suggesting successful reperfusion and largely normalized delivery of oxygen to tissue. The at-risk tissue
showed normal OC percent changes and in the ischemic
core showed mildly elevated OC percent changes. These
ﬁndings suggest that there is still some mismatch of
oxygen delivery and consumption in the ischemic core
compared to normal tissue after reperfusion, suggesting
that initial ischemic core did not completely recover
from its initial hemodynamic disturbance, and the
tissue fate is still evolving. The majority of the tissue
with delayed TTP in the ischemic penumbra did not
infarct as indicated by normal 24-h T2. The majority
of the initial ischemic core, which did not show delayed
OC TTP nor exaggerated OC percent changes, became
infarct tissue based on 24-h T2. The initially deﬁned
ischemic core tissue showed signiﬁcant hyperperfusion
which has been linked to worse outcome and increased
hemorrhagic transformation.22–24 Some of initial mismatch (at-risk) pixels also showed hyperperfusion at
24 h, indicating tissue fate is still evolving and may
become infarct later.22 The initially deﬁned core tissue
(which exhibited T2-weighted hyperintensity) showed
no signiﬁcant OC % changes at 24 h, suggesting that
the tissue was already dead.

the core during occlusion), the TTP calculation is not
possible or prompted to errors. Combining percent
change and TTP analysis is needed. For example, a
minimum percent change threshold could be set and
TTP of tissue with percent change lower than this
threshold will not be calculated or set to zero. A TTP
threshold can also be set and tissue with TTP lower
than this threshold will not be considered to be atrisk. Another potential shortcoming is that the absolute
TTP could be aﬀected by the oxygen delivery rate (i.e.
ﬂow rate and pressure of oxygen tank), which could
confound cross-laboratory comparison. This problem
can be addressed by comparing the TTP of the aﬀected
brain regions with normal homologous brain regions.
Another factor that could aﬀect the accuracy of TTP is
the repetition time (TR) of image acquisition. In this
study, we used 10-s TR to avoid T1 eﬀect of oxygen
challenge.5 Shorter TR (with reduced ﬂip angle to avoid
inﬂow eﬀect) will improve the TTP accuracy.

Conclusion
This study explored the utility of time-to-peak of the
T2*-weighted MRI of oxygen challenge to improve the
identiﬁcation of at-risk tissue in ischemic stroke.
Delayed OC TTP was highly co-localized with the perfusion–diﬀusion mismatch, and tissue with delayed OC
TTP was salvaged by reperfusion. OC TTP maps overcome some of the limitations of OC percent-change
maps in its ability to distinguish non-speciﬁc changes
from the veins and venules in normal tissues. The timecourse of the mismatch tissue appeared biphasic, with a
faster initial increase followed by a slower increase,
which could potentially oﬀer important physiological
information about at-risk tissue. Together these ﬁndings suggest that OC TTP oﬀers additional information
to the exaggerated OC percent changes to improve
identiﬁcation of at-risk tissue in ischemic stroke.
