Abstract. Gua Lou Gui Zhi decotion (GLGZD) has been
reported to be an effective treatment for post‑apoplectic limb
spasm in the clinic. The present study aimed to investigate
whether GLGZD had an affect on cerebral injuries induced
by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats and its
possible mechanism. High‑performance liquid chromatography
was performed to analyze GLGZD. Furthermore, a model was
established to assess the efficacy of GLGZD. Neurological defect
scores and screen tests were analyzed. Brain ischemic infarct
volume was measured using 2,3,5‑triphenyl tetrazolium chloride
staining and glutamic acid (Glu), aspartic acid (Asp) and glycine
(Gly) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid were measured using the
Hitachi automatic amino acid analyzer. Immunohistochemistry
was performed to determine the expression of the α‑amino‑3
‑hydroxy‑5‑methyl‑4‑isoxazole‑propionic acid (AMPA) and
N‑methyl‑D‑aspartic acid (NMDA) glutamate receptors, and
to analyze histopathological change. GLGZD was found to
improve neurological performance and reduce infarct volumes
in MCAO rats. In addition, GLGZD was observed to enhance
motor performance, which was assessed using the screen test.
Furthermore, GLGZD was found to reduce Glu, Asp and Gly
levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and downregulate the protein
expression of the AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors. Thus,

Introduction
Stroke, a cerebrovascular disease, is defined as a sudden
neurological deficiency in the brain, which is caused by either
hemorrhage or a lack of blood supply in the brain, termed ischemia. A total of 80% of strokes are caused by arterial blockage
and consequent ischemia and 20% are caused by hemorrhage.
At present, stroke represents one of the three most dangerous
diseases threatening human health (1). It has been reported that
70‑80% of stroke survivors have a level of disability, particularly
post‑apoplectic limb spasm, which has become an increasingly
serious social problem (2). Post‑apoplectic limb spasm is one of
the key difficulties, which is faced during rehabilitation therapy
following stroke, due to its high rate of motor impairment,
difficulty of treatment and importance for limb function (3).
The identification of effective therapeutic approaches to treat
post‑apoplectic limb spasm is important for stroke rehabilitation.
It is well established that excitotoxicity is the major pathophysiological mechanism underlying ischemic stroke‑induced
brain injury (4). Furthermore, excitatory amino acid
(EAA)‑induced excitotoxicity has been proposed to be involved
in post‑apoplectic limb spasm. Ischemia‑reperfusion (I/R)‑ind
uced injury has been reported to be associated with numerous
biochemical events, a number of which may result from the
release of EAAs and the activation of their receptors (5). When
EAAs reach toxic levels, they contribute to increased excitability, which leads to injury (6). The associated ion channels
open and cause excessive Ca2+ influx, which stimulates a cascade
of enzymatic processes, leading to irreversible injury (7). EAAs,
including glutamic acid (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp) are important neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS) and
have a major role in synaptic transmission. It is well established
that EAAs are involved in the transmission of sensory information and motion instruction (8).
A large number of pharmacological agents have been used
in attempt to improve motor impairment. These agents work
through a variety of neurotransmitter‑ and receptor‑associated

CHEN et al: GUA LOU GUI ZHI DECOTION AND STROKE

mechanisms (9). A number of these agents have been used in
clinical trials with varying results; however, many of these
agents exhibit considerable side effects. Traditional Chinese
medicine has advantages compared with these other pharmacological agents, including lower side effects, thus more
regular doses may be taken. Traditional Chinese medicines,
including Buyang Huanwu Decotion (10) and Xiao‑Xu‑Ming
decotion (11), have been used for stroke and muscular therapy
to treat post‑apoplectic limb spasm with the advantages of
easy administration and few adverse reactions.
Gua Lou Gui Zhi decotion (GLGZD) is a traditional
Chinese medicine that consists of the following extracts: Radix
Trichosanthis, Radix Paeoniae Alba, Ramulus Cinnamomi,
Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens, Radix Glycyrrhizae and Fructus
Ziziphi Jujubae. Clinical trials have found that GLGZD
improves limb muscle tension, benefiting locomotive function
and quality of life in patients with stroke (12‑14). However, the
effect of GLGZD on the release of EAAs in the brain during
I/R and the underlying mechanisms have yet to be elucidated.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by
reperfusion is a model of focal ischemia in rats, which resembles human ischemic stroke (15). The present study aimed to
investigate the levels of EAAs and their receptors within the
brain and whether GLGZD had a protective effect against I/R
through modulating the release of EAAs and the expression of
EEA receptors. Infarct volumes and neurological deficits were
measured and analyzed in five groups.
Materials and methods
Chemicals, reagents and animals. Specific pathogen-free
male Sprague‑Dawley rats (weight, 180-220 g) were obtained
from the Laboratory Animal Center of Fujian University of
Traditional Chinese Medicine (Fuzhou, China). The principles
of laboratory animal care were followed and the study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Fujian University of
Traditional Chinese Medicine.
Dried drugs were purchased from Tongchun Drugstore
(Fuzhou, China) and were identified by Professor Yang
(College of Pharmacy, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese
Medicine). Voucher specimens were deposited at the College of
Pharmacy of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.
Peoniflorin, liquiritigenin, liquiritin, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic
acid and glycyrrhizin were purchased from the National Institute
for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products
(Beijing, China). Methanol and acetonitrile were of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)‑grade and purchased
from Merck KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Phosphoric acid,
hydrochloric acid, petroleum, chloroform, acetoacetate and
N‑butanol were used as analytical reagents and were purchased
from Aladdin Reagents Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Other
reagents were all of analytical grade. The deionized water used
throughout the experiments was generated using a Millipore
water purification system (Billerica, MA, USA). A CX31 microscope was purchased from Olympus Corporation (Tokyo, Japan).
Preparation of GLGZD. According to ‘Jinkui Yaolue’ (16),
GLGZD consists of Radix Trichosanthis, Radix Paeoniae
Alba, Ramulus Cinnamomi, Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens,
Radix Glycyrrhizae and Fructus Ziziphi Jujubae. In order to

249

obtain the GLGZD water extract, volatile oils were extracted
from Ramulus Cinnamomi and Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens.
Other medical materials were decocted through boiling in
distilled water twice for 1 h. The solution was then dried under
vacuum to obtain a final concentration of 1.08 g/ml. GLGZD
was then stored for further analysis.
HPLC analysis of GLGZD. The GLGZD extract was subjected
to HPLC analysis. Sample solutions were injected into the HPLC
system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) for analysis in
triplicate. The HPLC system was equipped with a LC‑20A pump
system, SPD‑M20A photodiode array detector and Diamonsil®
C18 reversed‑phase column (I.D. 4.6x250 mm, 5 µm). Separation
was achieved using a linear gradient program for mobile phase A
(acetonitrile) and mobile phase B (water containing 0.1% phosphoric acid). The elution was initiated with a gradient of 95% B
for 45 min, followed by 68% for 15 min and 52% for 5 min. Flow
rate and injection volume were 1.0 ml/min and 10 µl, respectively.
Focal cerebral I/R model. An intraluminal suture method was
used for the induction of focal cerebral ischemia. Rats were
anesthetized using 10% chloral hydrate solution (0.3 ml/100 g
body weight; intraperitoneal injection). MCAO was induced
using an intraluminal suture method as described previously,
but with certain modifications (15). In brief, the left common
carotid artery (CCA) and the external carotid artery (ECA)
were exposed. A 3‑0 surgical monofilament nylon suture was
then inserted from the ECA into the internal carotid artery
(ICA) and was used to occlude the origin of the left MCA until
light resistance was felt (18‑20 mm from the CCA bifurcation).
After 2 h of MCAO, the nylon suture was withdrawn, followed
by 2 h of reperfusion.
Experimental grouping and treatment. Sixty rats were divided
into the following five experimental groups and underwent
the following treatments: Sham‑operated group (n=12), the
rats were subjected to surgical procedure, but MCAO was not
induced, except for exposure of the right ICA and the right
ECA; MCAO model group (n=12), rats received normal saline
and underwent MCAO surgery; positive control group (n=12),
rats received piracetam (6 g/kg body weight) and underwent
MCAO surgery; GLGZD low‑dose group (n=12), rats received
GLGZD (3.6 g/kg body weight) and underwent MCAO surgery;
and GLGZD high‑dose group (n=12), rats received GLGZD
(14.2 g/kg body weight) and underwent MCAO surgery. In the
GLGZD treatment groups, GLGZD was administered once a
day for seven days.
Scoring neurological defects. Rats were scored based on a
five‑point scale (17). The scale ratings were as follows: 0, no
neurological symptoms; 1, unable to completely extend the
front jaw on the other side; 2, rotating while crawling and
falling to the contralateral side; 3, unable to walk without
assistance; and 4, unconsciousness. Rats with a score of 1‑3
were considered successful models and were included in the
study. A sample of the ipsilateral cortex was taken at the indicated time and used for sample preparation.
Behavioral tests were performed on the rats after 60 min
of ischemia followed by seven days of exercise. Each rat was
scored based on a five‑point scale as described previously (18).

Screen tests. In order to investigate motor function recovery in
the rats subjected to ischemia, motor performance was measured
prior to surgery and on days one and eight following surgery.
In order to measure the muscle strength of the forelimbs, a net
screen was used (19). The trial commenced subsequent to placing
the rat on the horizontal screen on the ground. The screen was
turned over 90˚ within 2 sec by raising one side gradually. The
screen was maintained in this position for 5 sec.
The duration of time for which rats held on to the net screen
was recorded in seconds. The scoring criterion was as follows:
5, holding on to the screen and climbing upward; 4, holding on
to the screen with forelimbs and not falling down; 3, holding
on to the screen temporally, but slipping a certain distance; 2,
falling down to the ground within the test period; 1, falling
down to the ground as soon as the screen was at 90˚.
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and
measurement of brain ischemic infarct volume. The six rats in
each group were sacrificed by chloral hydrate and decapitated
in order to remove the brain to measure the infarct volume
following I/R. The brain was placed at 20˚C for ~10 min, then
cut into six coronal slices continuously from front to back using
a blade. The brain tissues were immersed into 2% TTC solution
(T8877; Sigma‑Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in phosphate‑buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and stained at 37˚C for 1 h and turned
over several times. Subsequent to staining, the viable cerebral
tissue was stained red while the infarcted cerebral tissue
remained pale. Images were captured using a high-resolution
digital camera (IXUS130; Canon, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed
using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD,
USA). Infarct volume was quantified using the Motic Med 6.0

Inc., Richmond, Canada), The infarct size was calculated as a
percentage of the viable cerebral tissue of the whole brain (20).

with hematoxylin and eosin. Histopathological changes were
observed using a light microscope.
Immunohistochemistry. Paraffin‑embedded brain tissue samples
(0.5x0.5x0.1 cm) were used for immunohistochemical analysis
of N‑methyl‑D‑aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) and glutamate
receptor (GluR) 1/2/3/4 expression. Briefly, the paraffin sections
were dewaxed, repaired using citric acid, incubated with 3%
H2O2, washed using PBS and blocked with normal goat serum.
Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies (polyclonal rabbit Anti-NMDA-NR and Anti‑GluR1/2/3/4; Beijing
Biosynthesis Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) at room temperature
for 2 h, washed using PBS and incubated with biotinylated
secondary antibodies. Sections were then washed, incubated
with horseradish peroxidase‑labeled streptavidin and stained
with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine. PBS was used to replace the
primary antibody as a negative control. Five high‑power fields
(magnification, x400) were randomly selected in each slide.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± standard
deviation. Analysis of variance was performed to determine
significant differences between the groups. SPSS 16.0 statistical software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for
statistical analyses. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results

Analysis of Glu, Asp and glycine (Gly) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected and the Glu,
Asp and Gly levels were analyzed using a Hitachi automatic
amino acid analyzer (21).

HPLC of GLGZD. Various mobile phase systems were used
to resolve the active constituents of GLGZD. The proposed
method of analysis gave simultaneous quantification of six
compounds. The individual constituents were identified
by comparing their peaks, UV spectra and retention times
against their corresponding reference standards (Fig. 1). The
percentage content of each compound was estimated using
a calibration curve. The compounds present in the GLGZD
extract were peoniflorin (74.2 mg/g), liquiritigenin (0.92 mg/g),
liquiritin (0.09 mg/g), cinnamic acid (0.20 mg/g), cinnamaldehyde (2.13 mg/g) and glycyrrhizic acid (1.14 mg/g).

Cerebral histopathology. Brain samples were collected from
six rats in each group for cerebral histopathological analysis.
The brain samples were paraffin‑embedded, sliced and stained

Effect of GLGZD on infarct volume. As shown in Fig. 2, the
infarct volume in the MCAO model group was found to be
significantly higher than that in the sham‑operated group.

Furthermore, seven days following ischemia, infarct volumes
were observed to be decreased in the GLGZD groups compared
with the MCAO model group. The infarct volumes in the
MCAO model group vs. the GLGZD groups were as follows:
0.77±0.13 vs. 0.29±0.12% for the GLGZD low‑dose group and
0.77±0.13 vs. 0.18±0.12% (P<0.05) for the GLGZD high‑dose
group. Infarct volume was more greatly reduced in the GLGZD
high‑dose group than the GLGZD low‑dose group. The infarct
volumes in the MCAO model group vs. the piracetum group
was 0.77±0.13 vs. 0.56±0.07% (P<0.05), showing that the
results were significantly different between the two groups.
Effect of GLGZD on neurological behavior and motor performance. The effect of GLGZD on neurological and motor
function were assessed by measuring neurological and motor
performance. The induction of MCAO for 60 min followed
by reperfusion for 2 h caused marked changes in rat behavior.
The neurological behavior of the rats that were subjected to
MCAO was measured using the scoring method described by
Longa et al (15). Motor performance was measured using a

screen test scoring method in order to investigate the motor
function recovery of the rats subjected to MCAO.
As shown in Fig. 3A and B, the rats in the MCAO model
group that were subjected to I/R injury, exhibited severe
neurological deficit (score: 2) and motor disorder, and showed
circling towards the contralateral side with a reduced mobility
compared with the rats in the sham‑operated group (score: 0).
Rats in the GLGZD groups showed significant improvements
in behavior between days 1 and 7, particularly those in the
high‑dose group. Rats in the piracetum group showed improvements in behavior between days 5 and 7, while no changes in
neurological function or motor performance were observed in
the rats in the sham‑operated group.
Effect of GLGZD on levels of the EAAs Glu, Asp and Gly in the
cerebrospinal fluid. The excessive release of EAAs in the brain
following I/R injury is closely associated with post‑apoplectic
limb spasm. As shown in Table Ι, MCAO induced significant
increases in the levels of the excitatory neurotansmitters Glu,
Asp and Gly. The levels of Glu, Asp and Gly in the low‑ and

high‑dose GLGZD groups were lower than those in the MCAO
model group, but higher than those in the sham‑operated group.
Similarly, compared with the MCAO model group, the levels
of Glu, Asp and Gly in the piracetum group decreased and
were significantly different (P<0.05). These findings show that
GLGZD had a modulatory effect on EAA levels.
Cerebral histopathology. As shown in Fig. 4, the cortical neural
cells in the sham‑operated group were observed to be arranged
orderly and to exhibit normal cell morphology, with clearly
visible structures and integrity. The cell membranes and nuclei
were normal, as was the tissue interspace, which exhibited no
edema or inflammatory cell infiltration. The cortical region of
the ischemic side of the brain in the rats in the MCAO model
group exhibited visible disorder and high levels of cell necrosis,
with cells showing nucleolar shrinkage and breakdown, as well
as vacuolar degeneration. Furthermore, the mesenchymal cells
demonstrated high levels of edema and inflammatory cell infiltration compared with those in the MCAO model group. The
cortical neural cells in the rats in the GLGZD groups showed
decreased pathological changes compared with those in the
MCAO model group. Neuronal degeneration and necrosis,
as well as disorderly cell arrangement, tissue edema, nuclear
dissolution and nucleolar shrinkage were observed in the cells
in the GLGZD treatment groups; however, the quantity and
extent was decreased compared with that in the MCAO model
group. Similarly, compared with the MCAO model group, the
cortical neural cells in the rats in the piracetum groups exhibited reduced pathological changes
Immunohistochemistry. Semi‑quantitative scoring was
performed according to the ratio of positively stained cells and
the staining intensity (22,23). Immunohistochemical scoring
revealed a significant increase in NMDAR and GluR1/3/4,
and a significant decrease in GluR2 in the hippocampus of
the MCAO model rats compared with the sham rats (Fig. 5;
Table Ⅱ). After seven days of high‑dose GLGZD administration, the scores were further reduced to 4.4±0.6 for NMDAR
(P<0.05), 4.4±0.7 for GluR1 (P<0.05), 3.6±0.3 for GluR3
(P<0.01) and 3.6±0.7 for GluR4, while they were upregulated
to 3.6±0.3 for GluR2 (P<0.01). For the piracetum groups,
the scores were reduced to 4.0±0.1 for NMDAR (P<0.05),

4.2±0.6 for GluR1 (P<0.05), 3.6±0.4 for GluR3 (P<0.01) and
2.8±0.5 for GluR4, while they were upregulated to 4.0±0.0 for
GluR2 (P<0.01). Alteration in the expression of NMDAR and
GluR1/2/3/4 was neutralized with GLGZD treatment.
Discussion
Stroke often causes motor impairment, which may be deﬁned
as a velocity‑dependent increase in resistance to passive stretch
or movement, resulting in abnormal signaling between the CNS
and the muscles, leading to muscle excitability (24). In the CNS,
EAAs and their receptors have been shown to have a crucial
role in motor impairment following cerebral I/R injury. Glu is
the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, and
the subsequent activation of its receptors induces an increase in
intracellular calcium and the generation of free radicals, leading
to cell death, necrosis or apoptosis (25). Asp is present in high
levels in the CNS within the hypothalamus and cerebellum,
and is an excitatory neurotransmitter of intermediate neurons,
which causes neuron depolarization and generates excitatory
postsynaptic potential with slow and persistent function (26). It
is well established that Gly has an important role in inhibitory
synaptic transmission in the spinal cord and the brain stem.
Furthermore, it has been reported that Gly is an important
facilitator of glumate function in the cerebrum, through an
allosteric site on the NMDA receptor (27). Therefore, Gly may
have excitatory and inhibitory roles in the CNS.
Ionotropic glutamate receptors consist of three subclasses:
NMDA, AMPA and kainate receptors, termed based on their
characteristic agonists. AMPA and kainate receptors are often
known as non‑NMDA receptors. NMDA and non‑NMDA
glutamate receptors have a role in mediating motor impairment (28). NMDAR toxicity is dependent on extracellular Ca2+
and occurs as a consequence of high Ca2+ inﬂux directly through
the receptor‑gated ion channel in the receptor (29). However, the
majority of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) channels have poor Ca2+
permeability (30). AMPA‑type GluRs are heteromeric channels
comprised of a combination of GluR1‑4 subunits (31), with
changes in the expression of GluR1‑4 being associated with
development, aging, epilepsy and alterations in synaptic efficacy.
The presence of the GluR2 subunit determines the permeability
of the AMPAR to Ca2+ and other divalent cations. The majority
of neurons exhibit high levels of GluR2 expression, which
renders these cells impermeable to calcium influx thorugh
AMPARs (32). Thus, AMPAR Ca2+ permeability is considered
to be determined by the relative abundance of GluR2 subunits in
the heteromeric AMPA receptors. It has been reported that ischemic conditions may alter the subunit composition of AMPA
receptors towards a more Ca2+‑permeable combination, which
may promote neuronal degeneration (33).
GLGZD has been used for the treatment of post‑apoplectic
limb spasm. Yang et al (14) showed that GLGZD had a
significant therapeutic effect on post‑apoplectic limb spasm.
The present study aimed to investigate the effect of GLGZD
on focal I/R insult‑induced motor impairment and behavioral
disturbance, by inducing cerebral I/R injury in rats. GLGZD
was found to improve neurological and motor performance.
Furthermore, the present study identified a large infarct
volume mainly in the cortex and striatum (or in the transient
focal cerebral ischaemic brains) of the ipsilateral hemisphere

of the brain in the ischemic rats. Pretreatment with GLGZD
at high‑ and low‑doses was observed to reduce the infarct
volume compared with the sham‑operated group. This
finding suggests that oral administration of GLGZD extracts
significantly inhibits reperfusion‑induced neuronal cell death.
In the present study, behavioral tests were used to assess the
success of MCAO. Screen tests were used to assess behavioral

dyskinesia caused by cerebral infarction. The findings suggest
that GLGZD improves stroke‑induced neurobehavioral abnormalities in rats.
In the present study, the quantity of Glu and Asp were
found to increase markedly in the brain tissue of the rats in the
MCAO model group, which indicates that the cytotoxicity of
EAAs is involved in the establishment of ischemic brain injury

and delayed nerve damage. The level of Gly in the brain tissue
was observed to increase significantly in the MCAO model
group, which may have a role in cerebral ischemia injury and a
synergistic toxic effect with Glu. GLGZD treatment was found
to inhibit the release of Glu and Asp during I/R.
Immunohistochemistry of the NMDAR revealed that
the mice in the low‑ and high‑dose GLGZD groups exhibited decreased positive NMDA expression, which may
reduce excessive activation of the NMDA receptor, as well
as reduce nerve cell cytotoxicity, necrosis and apoptosis.
Immunohistochemistry of AMPAR subunits revealed that the
the mice in the low‑ and high‑dose GLGZD groups exhibited
increased GluR2 expression, but decreased GluR1, 3 and 4
expression, which may prevent Ca2+ influx and have a protective
effect against nerve injury. Thus, the neuroprotective effects
of GLGZD may be partially due to its capacity to attenuate
excitotoxic Glu and Asp accumulation. The effect of Gly and its
receptors on cerebral I/R injury requires further investigation.
In conclusion, the present study established a HPLC
method to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the effect of
GLGZD on EEAs and their receptors in the brains of MCAO
model rats. The findings provides important insight into
GLGZD as a neuroprotective agent.
