Background and Purpose—Stroke-induced neuroinflammation and white matter damage are associated with neurological
deficits. Whether D-4F, an apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptide, treatment of stroke decreases neuroinflammation and
white matter damage and improves functional outcome has not been investigated.
Methods—Adult male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and were
orally administered saline as a vehicle control and different doses of D-4F (2, 4, 8, 16, or 32 mg/kg) starting at 2 h after
MCAo and daily until euthanized at 7 days after MCAo. D-4F treatment did not alter the blood levels of high-density
lipoprotein, total cholesterol, triglyceride, blood–brain barrier leakage, and infarction volume compared with control
group.
Results—D-4F (16 mg/kg) treatment of stroke significantly improved functional outcome, increased the white matter
density and the number of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the ischemic boundary zone of the ipsilateral striatum,
and increased myelin basic protein, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1), but decreased inflammatory factor Toll-like
receptor-4 and tumor necrosis factor-α expression in the ischemic brain 7 days after MCAo (P<0.05, n=11/group). The
neurite/axonal outgrowth in primary cultured neurons was significantly increased when treated with D-4F (100 ng/mL)
and IGF1 (100 ng/mL) compared with the nontreatment control. Inhibition of IGF1 significantly attenuated D-4F or IGF1
treatment–induced axonal outgrowth. D-4F-treatment did not increase oligodendrocyte–progenitor cell proliferation but
decreased oligodendrocyte–progenitor cell death.
Conclusions—D-4F treatment initiated 2 h after MCAo decreases neuroinflammation and white matter damage and
improves functional outcome after stroke. D-4F-induced increase in IGF1 may contribute to D-4F–induced neurite/
axonal outgrowth after stroke.   (Stroke. 2016;47:214-220. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.011046.)

ncreasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) functionality
may have important implications for treatment and prevention of cerebral inflammation and white matter (WM) damage
after stroke.1 D-4F is an 18-amino acid peptide that mimics the tertiary structure of apolipoprotein A-I and is easily
absorbed without liver toxicity. Previous studies show that
orally administered D-4F does not increase serum levels of
HDL, but does enhance HDL function, such as increased prebeta HDL formation, increased cholesterol efflux, conversion
of proinflammatory and dysfunctional HDL to anti-inflammatory and functional HDL,2–4 and alteration of HDL particle
size distribution and metabolism.5 However, the effect of D-4F
treatment of stroke on reducing WM damage and improving
neurological functional recovery after stroke has not been
investigated.
Macrophages/microglia were activated after stroke and
produced proinflammatory cytokines, proteolytic enzymes,
and growth factors that alter survival of neurons and axonal growth.6–9 Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNFα) are implicated in the stroke-induced

inflammatory process. The expression of TLR4 is upregulated in ischemic stroke, at least during the subacute stage,
which increases neuroinflammation and exacerbates stroke
injury.10–12 Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) expression is
regulated by TNFα and has anti-inflammatory properties and
an opposite effect to TNFα.13,14 Increasing IGF1 promotes
neuroprotection and decreases WM damage after stroke.7 In
this study, we investigate the hypothesis that D-4F treatment
reduces inflammation, improves WM damage and functional
recovery after stroke in mice, at least partially via the IGF1
signaling pathway.

artery occlusion (MCAo) using a 6-0 nylon filament method, as previously described.15 The animals were randomly divided into 3 sets:
(1) mice (n=11/group) were randomly orally administered different
doses of D-4F (BioMatik, Cambridge, ON, Canada) 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32
mg/kg and saline as vehicle control starting at 2 h after MCAo and
daily for a total of 7 days. These mice were used for functional test,
blood biochemistry and lesion volume measurement, and histochemical and immunohistochemical staining; (2) mice (n=12/group) were
orally administered saline or D-4F 16 mg/kg for 7 days and used for
blood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage measurement (n=6/group) and
Western blot (WB) and real time polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) assays (n=6/group). All survival animals were euthanized 7
days after MCAo. Total 120 mice were used and 18 mice died; the
mortality rate is 15% in this study.

Total RNA was isolated using a standard protocol. Quantitative
PCR was performed on an ABI 7000 PCR instrument (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using 3-stage program parameters provided by the manufacturer. Each sample was tested in triplicate and

Blood Biochemical Measurement
Blood was collected from the tail vein 7 days after MCAo, and the
level of HDL, total cholesterol, and triglyceride were measured using CardioChek P•A analyzer (Polymer Technology System Inc.
Indianapolis, IN) following the manufacture’s instruction.

BBB Leakage Measurement
Evans blue dye extravasation was used for quantification of BBB
leakage 7 days after MCAo.16

Histochemical/Histoimmunostaining and Infarct
Volume Measurement
Mice brains were fixed embedded in paraffin and were cut into 7
equally spaced (1 mm) coronal blocks. For calculation of lesion
volume, a series of adjacent 6-μm-thick sections were cut from
each block and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.17 Every 10th
coronal section was cut from the center of the lesion (bregma −1
mm to +1 mm), and a total of 5 sections were used for staining
of Bielshowsky silver (BS, an axon marker), Luxol Fast Blue (a
myelin marker), SMI31 (a marker of phosphorylated neurofilament,
1:1000, Covance), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (a marker of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells [OPCs], 1:100;
Chemicon).17
For immunostaining quantitative measurement, 5 sections with
each section containing 8 fields of view within the cortex and striatum from the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ, which is adjacent to
the ischemic core) were digitized using a 40× objective (Olympus
BX40) with a 3-CCD color video camera (Sony DXC-970MD) interfaced with an Micro Computer Imaging Device (MCID) analysis
system (Imaging Research, St. Catharines, Canada). The following were calculated: (1) the percentage of BS+, Luxol Fast Blue+,
or SMI31+ area in the WM bundles IBZ; and (2) the number of
platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha+ cells in the IBZ of
the ipsilateral striatum.

WB Assay
The IBZ brain tissue and the equal volumes of homologous contralateral tissue were extracted for WB assay. Total protein was
isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and the protein samples were
heated in 1% SDS for ≈20 min at 60°C to recover the protein activity. The samples were normalized for total protein content in WB
assay. Specific proteins were visualized using a SuperSignal West
Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). The following primary antibodies against myelin basic protein (a myelin marker, 1:200; Dako,
Carpinteria, CA), IGF1 (1:1000, Abcam), TLR4 (1:500, Santa
Cruz), TNFα (1: 1000, Abcam), and β-actin (1: 2000; Santa Cruz)
were used for WB assay.

To investigate whether D-4F-treatment increases neurite outgrowth
and to further elucidate whether IGF1 mediates D-4F-induced neurite
outgrowth after stroke, a primary cortical neuron (PCN) culture and
neurite outgrowth measurements were used.7 Briefly, PCNs were isolated from E15 C57BL/6 mice and cultured with 8-well slide chambers. On day in vitro 3, to mimic ischemia in vivo, the PCN cultures
were subjected to 3 h of oxygen and glucose deprivation in DMEM
with serum- and glucose-free media. The PCNs were then cultured with neurobasal medium plus 2% B-27, 2 mmol/L GlutaMax,
and 1% antibiotic antimycotic. After 24 h, the PCNs were divided
into 5 groups as follows: (1) nontreatment as control; (2) +D-4F
(100 ng/mL); (3) +IGF1 (recombinant mouse IGF1 protein, 100 ng/mL;
Abcam, Cat No ab9861); (4) +D-4F+IGF1 inhibitor (AG1024, 10
μM; Calbiochem, Cat No 121767); and (5) +IGF1+IGF1 inhibitor.
AG1024 is a cell-permeable, reversible, substrate competitive, and
specific inhibitor of IGF-1 and insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity.18 The PCNs were allowed to incubate for another 24 h before
being immunostained for TUJ1 (a phenotypic marker of neural cells,
1:1000; Covance) with Cy3 and photographed using a 10× objective
fluorescent microscope (Zeiss). The average length of the 20 longest
neurites in each well (n=6 wells/group) was measured using MCID
software.
To further investigate whether D-4F treatment increases axonal
outgrowth and whether IGF1 mediates D-4F treatment–induced axonal outgrowth, a microfluidic axonal growth model (Standard Neuron
Device; catalog No SND450, Xona Microfluidics) was also used.19
Briefly, microchambers were affixed to poly-d-lysine–coated (SigmaAldrich) dishes (35 mm, Corning), and the PCNs were plated at a
density of 6×105 cells/chamber in DMEM with 5% FBS. PCNs were
changed to neuronal growth media after 24 h incubation. On day in
vitro 3, culture medium containing 20 μM 5-fluorodeoxyuridine was
used to kill astrocytes. The PCN cultures were then divided into the
same 5 groups as above and subjected to the above neurite outgrowth
measurements. PCNs were allowed to grow for day in vitro 5, and
axonal outgrowth length was measured (n=6wells/group).19

Premature Oligodendrocyte Cell Line Culture
To investigate the effect of D-4F on OPC proliferation and survival,
an immortalized mouse premature oligodendrocyte cell line (N20.1;
generously provided by Dr Anthony Campagnoni, UCLA) culture
was used.6 N20.1 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) media with 10% FBS and 100 μg/mL G418. Two hours of oxygen and
glucose deprivation was induced, and cells were treated with (1) nontreatment for control; and (2) D-4F (100 ng/mL) for 48 h (n=6 wells/
group). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as a cell death assay, and
MTS (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl]2-[4-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium), as a cell proliferation assay, were
performed.
For the LDH assay, the CytoTox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity
assay kit (Promega) was used. Data are presented as percentage of
LDH level in the media to total LDH both in the media and cells.
For MTS assay, CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation
Assay kit (Promega) was used. Absorbance was recorded at 490 nm.6

Statistical Analysis
All measurements were performed by experimenters blinded to
each group and condition. Results are expressed as the mean±SE.
Significance of difference between animal groups was determined
by 1-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for
blood chemistry, lesion volume, functional evaluation, and neurite/
axonal outgrowth; 2-way analysis of variance was used for analysis
of WB and RT-PCR data; and Student t test was used for BBB leakage, WM density, and OPC number measurements. Correlation between the BS+ axon density and modified neurological severity score
was tested by Pearson’s correlation coefficients.

Results
D-4F Treatment Effect on Blood Lipids and
Lipoproteins, Lesion Volume, BBB Leakage, and
Functional Outcome 7 Days After Stroke

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

There were no significant differences in the blood levels of
HDL, total cholesterol and triglyceride (Figure 1A), and
infarction volume (Figure 1B) among animals in the control
or MCAo mice treated with 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 mg/kg of D-4F
daily for 7 days. However, treatment of stroke with 16 mg/kg
D-4F significantly improved neurological functional outcome
7 days as tested by modified neurological severity score and
at 3 and 7 days as tested by foot fault after stroke (P<0.05),
respectively. Therefore, the 16 mg/kg D-4F treatment was
selected for further measurement of BBB leakage, WM density, and WB/RT-PCR assay. No significant difference in BBB
leakage was observed between D-4F treatment and MCAo
alone groups 7 days after stroke (Figure 1C).

D-4F Treatment Decreased WM Damage and
Increased OPC Number in the Ischemic Brain After
Stroke
To test whether D-4F treatment decreases WM damage after
stroke, the WM change and OPC number measurements
were performed using histochemical- or histoimmunostaining. The density of BS+axon/Luxol Fast Blue+myelin/
SMI31+phosphorylated neurofilament in the WM bundles in
the IBZ of ipsilateral hemispheres and the number of plateletderived growth factor receptor alpha+OPCs in the IBZ of ipsilateral striatum were significantly increased (Figure 2A–2D,
P<0.05, n=11/group) in D-4F treatment mice compared with
nontreatment MCAo control mice. Using Pearson’s correlation coefficients analysis, we found that the functional outcome (modified neurological severity score) was significantly
and negatively correlated with BS+axon density (Figure 2A;
r=−0.835, P<0.05).
To confirm the immunostaining data, myelin basic protein
level was measured by WB assay and was confirmed increased
by D-4F treatment (Figure 3A; P<0.05, n=6/group). These
data indicate that increasing axonal density may contribute to
D-4F–induced neurological functional outcome after stroke.

D-4F Treatment of Stroke Decreased Inflammatory
Factors (TLR4 and TNFα) but Increased IGF1
Expression in the Ischemic Brain After Stroke
To test the mechanism by which D-4F treatment reduced WM
damage after stroke, we measured IGF1/TLR4/TNFα gene
and protein expression. Our data show that IGF1 protein/

increased IGF1 but decreased TNFα/TLR4 mRNA levels in
the contralateral brain when compared with MCAo control
mice (Figure 3B; P<0.05, n=6/group).

D-4F Treatment Increased PCN Neurite and Axon
Outgrowth and Decreased OPC Death; IGF1
Mediates D-4F Treatment–Induced Neurite/Axon
Growth After Stroke
To confirm the in vivo findings, in vitro neurite/axonal outgrowth and OPC proliferation/survival studies were performed
using PCN/axonal or N20.1 cell culture models. The optimal
doses of D-4F (100 ng/mL) used for PCN and OPC cultures
were selected from our pilot study of D-4F dose effect (5, 50,
100, 250, and 500ng/mL) on the MTS assay (data not shown).
We found that PCN neurite outgrowth significantly increased
after treatment with D-4F or IGF1 compared with the nontreatment PCNs 24 h after oxygen and glucose deprivation
(Figure 4A; P<0.05, n=6/group). Inhibition of IGF significantly attenuated D-4F- and IGF treatment–induced neurite

outgrowth. Similarly, the axonal outgrowth in axon cultures
treated both with D-4F and IGF1 significantly increased
compared with the nontreatment axons 48 h after treatment
(Figure 4B; P<0.05, n=6/group). Inhibition of IGF significantly attenuated D-4F- and IGF-induced axonal outgrowth.
D-4F treatment did not increase OPC proliferation but significantly decreased OPC death measured by MTS and LDH
assays, respectively (Figure 4C), which is consistent with the
myelin protective effect observed in vivo.

Discussion
In this study, we found that D-4F treatment of stroke initiated
2 h after the ischemic onset did not change blood levels of
lipid and lipoprotein, infarct volume, and BBB leakage in the
ischemic brain, but significantly decreased TLR4 and TNFα
gene and protein levels in the ischemic brain and improved
neurological functional outcome 7 days after stroke. D-4F

anti-inflammatory index.20 D-4F treatment also had no effect
on infarct size in mice with myocardial infarction.21 LDL
receptor null (LDLR−/−) mice treated with D-4F exhibited
no significant differences in plasma lipids and lipoproteins,
but had significantly reduced inflammation and cognitive
impairment.22,23 D-4F inhibits inflammatory properties (TNFα
and IL-1β) in the brain of APPSwe-PS1 Delta E9 mice and
improves cognitive function.24 These data are consistent with
our findings in the present study.
After an ischemic stroke, there is a prolonged inflammatory response and a secondary phase of WM damage that may
be more amenable to treatment than the acute injury.8,9 WM
is composed of bundles of myelinated axons. WM damage
defined as axonal degeneration and loss of myelin induces

disturbance of nerve impulse transport between neurons and
evokes serious neurological functional deficits after stroke.25
OPCs are immature forms of oligodendrocytes. OPC may
proliferate and differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes
and, thereby, help to decrease the burden of axonal injury.
Enhanced proliferation, migration, and differentiation of OPCs
are seen in the peri-infarct region and in the subventricular
zone after stroke.26 OPCs are the key source of myelin production and, thus, are essential for repair of damaged WM after
stroke and play an important role in promotion of functional
recovery after brain injury.27 Stroke-induced cerebral inflammatory processes adversely impact WM, including axon and
myelin structural integrity, which is associated with long-term
neurological functional deficits after stroke.28,29 In this study,

we found that the decreased axonal damage was significantly
and negatively correlated with the functional outcome. D-4F
treatment of stroke increased axonal and myelin integrity as
well as increased the numbers of oligodnedrocytes/OPCs in
the ischemic brain. D-4F also increased PCN neurite/axonal
outgrowth and OPC survival in vitro. These data support the
hypothesis that by decreasing WM damage, D-4F treatement
induced functional outcome after stroke.
IGF1 is an important growth factor that promotes neuronal
and oligodendrocytes differentiation, proliferation, myelination, and neurite outgrowth, reduces apoptosis, and sustains cell
survival both in the developing brain and throughout life.30–35
IGF1 also reduces gray matter and WM damage after stroke and
upregulates OPC numbers via suppression of apoptosis.33,36,37
Conversely, one might predict that inhibition of IGF1 signaling
via blockade of the IGF1 receptor would potentially increase
the severity of ischemic brain injury. TNFα markedly decreased
IGF1 mRNA and protein, leading to a reduction in bioactive
IGF1 in myoblasts, skeletal muscle, and vascular smooth
muscle cell.38 Activation of TNFα signaling can inhibit IGF1
signaling and thus elevate inflammatory cytokines in skeletal
muscle in vivo.13,14 In the present study, we found that D-4F
significantly decreased TNFα but increased IGF1 level and
decreased WM damage in the ischemic brain after stroke, and
in vitro study shows that both D-4F and IGF1 treatment significantly increased neurite/axon outgrowth, whereas inhibition of
IGF1 attenuated D-4F- or IGF1-induced axonal growth. D-4F
treatment did not increase OPC proliferation but significantly
decreased OPC death. These data suggested that the increase
of IGF1 may contribute to D-4F treatment–induced neurite and
axonal outgrowth after stroke in mice.

Limitations
(1) We did not test whether D-4F improves functional outcome
in nonstroke animals; we only tested the D-4F treatment effect
in young (3- to 4-month-old) male stroke mice because female
mice are a more complex preclinical model because of the hormonal changes associated with the estrus cycle. In addition, the
therapeutic response to D-4F may differ between young and
old subjects. Thus, the effects of D-4F on females and elderly
animals, both male and female, warrant further investigation.
(2) We only evaluated the D-4F treatment effect on decreasing
WM damage in the ischemic brain; whether D-4F regulates
gray matter warrants investigation. (3) Given the experimental
design of acute 2 h poststroke treatment, we cannot distinguish
between WM-protective and WM-restorative effects. Clearly,
D-4F did not decrease lesion volume, but it may protect WM.
(4) Previous studies have found that D-4F treatment significantly decreases brain arteriole inflammation and cognitive
impairment. However, the scrambled D-4F treatment did not
induce the beneficial effects.23 The scrambled D-4F control
was not used in this study; therefore, our current findings have
not yet been demonstrated to be specific to D-4F.
In summary, we are the first to report that D-4F treatment
initiated 2 h after stroke significantly decreased neuroinflammation and WM damage and improved functional outcome 7
days after MCAo. IGF1 may mediate D-4F treatment–induced
neurite/axonal outgrowth.
