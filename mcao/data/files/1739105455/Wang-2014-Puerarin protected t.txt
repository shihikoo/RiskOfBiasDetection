Puerarin is extensively attractive because of its superior neuroprotective effects in stroke prevention. This
paper focused on the protective effect of puerarin both in vivo and in vitro. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was operated on male Sprague-Dawley rat for 2 h, different doses of puerarin (2.62, 7.86
and 23.59 mg/kg) or vehicle were gavaged 1 h after reperfusion. Rats were sacriﬁced after 24 h or 7 days
treatment of puerarin/vehicle. In 7.86 and 23.59 mg/kg groups, infarct volume was reduced (P < 0.05)
when puerarin was given once; 7 days puerarin intervention further reduced the infarct volume
(P < 0.05) compared with vehicle-treated animal. The modiﬁed neurological severity score (mNSS) was
also raised in day 4 in 7.86 and 23.59 mg/kg groups and in all groups in day 7 compared with vehicle
(P < 0.05). The number of Nissl body, cleaved caspase-3 and GFAP positive cells increased observably
after stroke in dose-dependence in rats. In our in vitro study, we have found that puerarin inhibited the
pro-apoptosis factor and upregulated the BDNF secret of astrocytes after OGD-R. This indicated that the
repairing effect of puerarin was associated with the astrocyte protection.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the ﬁrst cause of
adult disability in industrial countries. However, treatments that
effectively limit the tissue injury and brain dysfunction in these
conditions remain elusive. Despite progress made in understanding
the pathophysiology of stroke, today the only efﬁcacious treatment
approved for ischemic stroke is thrombolysis. Unfortunately, only
3%e5% of patients can be selected to undergo this treatment.
Therefore, the need for developing an effective treatment for stroke
remains vital (Belayev et al., 2009; Minnerup and Schabitz, 2009;
Yilmaz and Granger, 2010).
Astrocytes are the most numerous nonneuronal cell type in the
central nervous system and make up about 50% of human brain
volume (Tower and Young, 1973), and neurons cannot survive in the
brain without close interaction with astrocytes. Consequently, in
any region where astrocytes fail to survive there will necessarily be
failure of neuronal survival and no possibility for synaptic

remodeling (Chen and Swanson, 2003). Accordingly, astrocyte
function can critically inﬂuence neuronal survival during ischemia
and other brain insults. Astrocytes are thought to be relatively more
resistant to hypoxic damage than neurons (Zhou et al., 2013).
However, astrocytes are the ﬁrst cells that suffer ischemic insult
among all types of neural cells, because their end feet directly
surround capillaries (Garcia et al., 1993).
Puerariae radix, the root of the familiar kudzu vine, is one of the
earliest medicinal herbs employed in ancient China and South East
Asia (Prasain et al., 2003). It is used to cure multiple diseases, such
as anti-intoxication to treat alcohol related problems, fever, acute
dysentery, diarrhea et al. (Keung and Vallee, 1998; Penetar et al.,
2012). As one of the main composition of puerariae radix, puerarin exhibits superior function in various diseases. The most
distinguished utility is the protective effect in cardiovascular system. The anti-hypertensive effect of puerarin was ﬁrst observed in
1980s and suggested that puerarin exerts its anti-hypertensive effect in cats (Lu et al., 1987). In the last decade, puerarin was been
reported to deal with vasodilation diabetic and diabetic complications (Xu et al., 2005; Yan et al., 2009). There are also a huge
number of evidence conﬁrmed that puerarin has cardioprotective
effect against ischemia and reperfusion, and this was investigated
extensively in both vitro and vivo. This protection is conﬁrmed
through apoptosis inhibition, anti-inﬂammation and other effects

(Durukan and Tatlisumak, 2007; Lo et al., 2003). However, there is
few reports about the protective effect of puerarin on astrocyte
cells, so the beneﬁcial effect of puerarin via astrocyte protection in
our article is investigated for the ﬁrst time.

2.9. Evaluation of modiﬁed neurological severity scores
Modiﬁed neurological severity scores (mNSS) is a composite of motor, sensory,
reﬂex, and balance tests. Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0e18
(normal score, 0; maximal deﬁcit score, 18). In the severity scores of injury, 1 score
point is awarded for the inability to perform the test or for the lack of a tested reﬂex;
thus, the higher score, the more severe is the injury (Ye et al., 2011). In our research,
one day before MCAO, all the animals were trained to walk on the balance beam.
mNSS behavioral test was performed before MCAO and at 1 h, 2, 4 and 7 days after
MCAO by an observer blinded to the treatment groups.
2.10. 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and decapitated at the reperfusion
of 24 h or 7 days. The brains were rapidly removed and sliced into 2 mm-thick slices
with a metallic brain matrix. The brain slices were stained with 1% TTC at 37  C for
15 min in dark, and then ﬁxed by 4% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered solution.
The unstained area of the brain slice was deﬁned as infarction, infarct volume ratio
was measured and calculated as described previously (Wang et al., 2012).

2.2. Animals
All procedures were carried out in accordance with the guidelines on care and
use of laboratory animals set out by Xi’an Jiaotong University Animal Ethics Committee. All animals were obtained from school of Medicine Laboratory Animal
Center, Xi’an Jiaotong University (Shaanxi, China).
2.3. Cell cultures
Cortical astrocytes were harvested from the brain of 1-day-old rats by following
a previously reported method with some modiﬁcations (He et al., 2013). Brieﬂy,
cerebral cortices were isolated, cleaned of white matter and meninges, minced, and
gently pipetting the tissue blocks for twenty times. The dissociated cells were
diluted with growth medium (high-glucose Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin), seeded onto poly-Llysine-precoated 75-cm2 plastic ﬂasks at a density of 2  105 cells/cm2, and maintained in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 incubator at 37  C. After 14 days, the ﬂasks were
sealed and gently shaken at 320 rpm for 24 h to remove the loosely adherent oligodendrocytes and microglial cells from the monolayer of astrocytes. The remaining
cells were identiﬁed morphologically by glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
immunohistochemical staining. Over 95% of the cells were found to be GFAP positive. The density of conﬂuent astrocytes was w1  105 cells/cm2.
2.4. Cell viability
Cell viability was measured by MTT (SigmaeAldrich) as described previously
(Zhou et al., 2010).
2.5. Oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion assay
Cortical astrocytes dissociated cortical cultures were seeded in 6-well plate
(1  106/well) for 12 h, the media were changed with serum-free DMEM at 37  C in a
humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% N2 and the cells were continued to culture for 6 h followed by reperfusion for 2 h. Then the cells were cultivated for other
12 h with adding different dosage of puerarin (0.08, 0.4, 2 mM) in the media.

2.11. Nissl stain
Rats were maintained for 7 days, reanesthetized with 10% chloralic hydras,
processed by transcardial perfusion ﬁrst with vehicle, then with 10% neutral buffered formalin, brains were removed and immersed into 10% neutral buffered
formalin, and then followed with parafﬁn embedding, histologic sections were cut,
dewaxed, rehydrated and stained with 0.5% (m/v) Toluidine Blue for 15 min. Nissl
bodies in the penumbral area were counted with Image-Pro Plus 6. 0.
2.12. Immunoﬂuorescence
Brains were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde by transcardiac perfusion and
postﬁxed in the same solution overnight at 4  C. Brain sections (5 mm) were prepared using a microtome, and immunological staining was performed using a previously described ﬂoating method (Belayev et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2008a). Primary
antibody was diluted 1:100 for anti-GFAP followed by incubation with secondary
anti-bodies. Three coronal brain slices/animal (n ¼ 3 animals/group) were stained to
perform numerical quantiﬁcation of GFAP-positive cells. Three 20 ﬁelds/section
were analyzed in the penumbral area of the infarct from stroke brains and an
anatomically similar area in sham animals. GFAP positive cells were counted using
Image-Pro Plus software with a DAPI counterstain by a blinded investigator. The
average total number of positive cells from three sections for each animal with three
ﬁelds of view/section was used for statistical analysis.
2.13. Immunohistochemistry
Brain tissue was treated with the immunoﬂuorescence method. Brain sections
were incubated with cleaved caspase-3 overnight at 4  C. Then, sections were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 30 min. The positive signal was detected using histostainÔ e plus kits. Diaminobenzidine was used
as a chromogen. Tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated,
and coverslipped. The level of cleaved caspase-3 expression was quantiﬁed as
number of positive (brown) cells/total number of cells  100, and the average total
number of positive cells from three sections for each animal with three ﬁelds of
view/section was used for statistical analysis.

2.6. Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested, washed in PBS, and resuspended in binding buffer. One
hundred microliters of 105 cells were incubated with Annexin-V-FITC and PI in dark
for 15 min. The analysis was carried out with an FACS (Zhang et al., 2008b, 2011).
2.7. Surgical procedures for middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Forty male adult SpragueeDawley rats (weighing 250 ge270 g) were fasted
overnight but allowed free access to water. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
surgery was carried out as described previously (Horn and Klein, 2013; Zhang and
Pardridge, 2001). In brief, anesthesia was induced by chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg).
A 30-mm length of monoﬁlament nylon suture (F0.22e0.24 mm) with a spherical
tip was inserted from the left CCA to ICA through a small incision in the common
carotid artery to occlude the origin of the left middle cerebral artery. Occlusion of the
MCA was maintained for 2 h, and this was followed by reperfusion for various durations. The sham operation is the same as the above procedure except inserting the
nylon thread.

2.14. Western blot analysis
Method for Western blot analyses was similar to those described previously
(Zhang et al., 2012). The cells treated with or without puerarin were prepared by
extracting proteins with RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail on ice. Cell lysates were analyzed for western blot
analysis with primary antibodies (BCL-2, BAX, AKT, P-AKT, BDNF, P-ERK and GAPDH),
followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The protein expression was analyzed
using Quantity one, 1-D analysis software (Version 4.4, Bio-Rad).
2.15. Statistical analysis
The data are presented as the mean  standard error of mean (SEM) and
analyzed for statistical signiﬁcance using analysis of variance, two-tailed tests were
used for 2-group comparisons. Differences at P < 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

3. Results
2.8. Administration of puerarin
Puerarin with a purity of 99% was obtained from Xi’an Rongsheng biological
technology co., LTD (Xi’an, China). Puerarin stock solutions were prepared in water
containing 0.5% CMC-Na (m/v). In doseeresponse studies, puerarin was administered at concentrations of 2.62, 7.86 and 23.59 mg/kg. All treatments or vehicle were
applied intragastric administration 1 h after MCAO randomly. For investigating the
long term protection of puerarin in rats, 7 days continuous intragastric administration of puerarin or vehicle was employed in each group.

3.1. Puerarin suppressed infarct formation in the postischemic brain
with an extended therapeutic window
To investigate the neuroprotective effect of puerarin against
cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury, rats were treated with
puerarin after MCAO 3 h and 7 days with puerarin, respectively.

284

The infarct volume rate was assessed in the mean time. At 3 h
post-MCAO treatment group, the infarct volume ratio of each
group (vehicle, 2.62, 7.86, and 23.59 mg/kg) were 32.2%  1.5%
22.0%  1.4%, 13.4%  1.9% and 13.3%  2.0%, respectively
(Fig. 1A1 and B), the ischemia volume of 7.86 mg/kg and the
23.59 mg/kg groups declined obviously compared with vehicle
(P < 0.05). No signiﬁcant neuroprotective effect was observed at
the lowest dose (2.62 mg/kg) group (P > 0.05). On a daily basis of
puerarin or vehicle for 7 days, the infarct volume ratio was
further decreased in the 7.86 and 23.59 mg/kg groups
(7.24%  1.30% and 1.62%  2.81%, respectively. Fig. 1A2 and B).
The decrease reveals signiﬁcant difference between the 1 day and
7 days group in these two doses (P < 0.05). Motor activities were
assessed using mNSS. The neurologic score was normal
(score ¼ 0) before MCAO. All animals appeared high-grade
behavioral deﬁcits after 1 h of reperfusion, the average score of
the vehicle, 2.62, 7.86, 23.59 mg/kg groups were 12.25  0.55,
11.66  0.58, 11.00  0.52 and 11.25  0.56, respectively. Vehicletreated animals continued to exhibit severe behavioral impairments throughout the 7-day survival period. No obvious decrease
of the mNSS score was observed after 1 h or 2 days reperfusion in
the three puerarin groups (Fig. 2). In day 4, the medium and high
doses of puerarin (7.86 and 23.59 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly improved
the neurologic score compared with vehicle-treated rats

(P < 0.05, Fig. 2). After 7 days continuous treatment, all the drug
groups presented signiﬁcantly improvement of the neurologic
score compared with the vehicle group (low to high doses
1.67  0.58, 1.25  0.50 and 0.75  0.50 compared with vehicle
6.75  0.50, P < 0.05).
3.2. Puerarin increased the number of Nissl body and astrocyte in
the injury brain of MCAO rats
The brains of vehicle-treated animals with MCAO exhibited a
consistent pannecrotic lesion in the left hemisphere, characterized microscopically by the destruction of neuronal, glial, and
vascular elements. By contrast, this damage was prevented
dramatically by puerarin therapy in the medium and high-dose
treatment groups but not in the low-dose group (Fig. 3). Puerarin (23.59 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly increased the numbers of Nissl
body (577.7  39.7, P < 0.05) compared with vehicle
(171.0  21.8), and almost reached the sham group (602.7  3.2).
The 2.62 and 7.86 mg/kg/day groups are 295.0  24.8 and
485.3  23.4 (Fig. 3, P < 0.05). GFAP positive cells were also
increased when treated with different doses of puerarin, the
positive cell numbers of GFAP in the vehicle group, 2.62, 7.86 and
23.59 mg/kg/day groups are 19.7  4.5, 37.3  3.1, 62.3  2.5 and
76.0  3.6, respectively (Fig. 4).

3.3. Puerarin inhibited apoptosis on rat MCAO brain and primary
cultured rat astrocyte
Because cleaved caspase-3 is one of the key executioners of
apoptosis, we analyzed the levels of cleaved caspase-3 in brain
sections by immunohistochemistry staining after 7 day puerarin
therapy. Microscopic examination of cleaved caspase-3 staining
showed an increased number of positive cells in 7.86 and 23.59 mg/
kg/day (P < 0.05) compared to the vehicle treated group, as shown
in Fig. 5.
Primary cultured cortical astrocytes were identiﬁed by GFAP
immunoﬂuorescence assay. More than 95% of cells were GFAPpositive (Supplemental Fig. 1). Those cells underwent OGD-R and
different concentrations of puerarin treatment, apoptotic astrocytes were measured by FACS. Annexin-V staining combined with
PI staining was undertaken in cells in the control group and cells
treated with puerarin at different concentrations, and then
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry. Early apoptosis was in the right
quadrant of a doteplot graph using Annexin-V-FITC vs. PI. The
apoptotic cells of the OGD-R group was 98.5% (Fig. 6B), this indicates that the OGD-R injury caused severe cell apoptosis, After
treatment with puerarin (0.08 and 0.4 mM) after OGD-R, the percentage of late stage apoptotic cells were decreased to 46.7% and
33.2% (Fig. 6C and D), on the 2 mM group, cell apoptosis was
decreased obviously (7%, Fig. 6E), almost droped to the control
group (2%, Fig. 6A).
3.4. Puerarin regulated the expression of apoptosis related proteins
both in vitro and in vivo
BCL-2 and BAX belong to the BCL-2 family of proteins that
promote cell survival, whereas BAX accelerates apoptosis. In our
in vitro study, western blotting results revealed that BAX expression
was signiﬁcantly increased in the OGD-R group compared with the
sham group on astrocyte cells. Addition of puerarin decreased the
BAX expression level in concentration dependence. On the other
hand, the level of BCL-2 in the OGD group was signiﬁcantly
decreased compared with the control group, but recovered
following puerarin treatment (Fig. 7A1 and A2). BDNF was a
beneﬁcial factor on anti-apoptosis and neuron survival. In our
experiment, the produce of BDNF in astrocyte was also induced by

puerarin treatment after OGD-R (Fig. 7A3). Statistical analysis of the
BAX/BCL-2 ratio revealed that puerarin treatment could ameliorate
the OGD-induced elevation in BAX/BCL-2 ratio and increase the
expression of BDNF in astrocyte cells.
In our in vivo research, the same change trend of BCL-2/BAX was
observed in rats. BAX was signiﬁcantly increased after MCAO, the
ratio of BCL-2/BAX was increased obviously when the MCAO rats
were treated with different doses of puerarin (Fig. 7B1 and 2).
3.5. Puerarin upregulated P-AKT and P-ERK level after OGD-R
To determine the role of puerarin in Akt signaling following
OGD-R in astrocytes, we analyzed the protein level of P-AKT and PERK. Puerarin treatment signiﬁcantly improved the phosphorylation level of AKT in dose-dependent (Fig. 8). ERK/MAPK pathway
was also important in cell survival after OGD-R injury, as a vital
factor of MAPK pathway and a downstream factor of BDNF, the
phosphorylation level of ERK was increased (Fig. 8) in the same
group. This indicated that puerarin protected astrocyte though
PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK pathway following OGD-R.
4. Discussion
The goal of our study was to determine whether a lower dose of
puerarin was efﬁcacious in protecting the brain when administered
after transient, focal cerebral ischemia. Our results clearly demonstrate that this treatment, when applied at 3 h after MCAO onset,
improves the outcome as measured by neurologic score and by
pathologic estimation of the size of infarction. This effect was
associated with astrocyte protection.
Our results established efﬁcacy and the doseeresponse relation
for the neuroprotective effects of puerarin in rat model of MCAO.
The most remarkable effect was found in rats treated with the
medium (7.86 mg/kg) and high (23.59 mg/kg) doses of puerarin.
Vehicle-treated rats showed a large cortical and subcortical infarct.
By contrast, puerarin-treated animals had signiﬁcantly reduced (by
33%e14%) infarct volumes compared with those in the vehicletreated group. No signiﬁcant neuroprotective effects were
observed at the lowest dose (2.62 mg/kg) of puerarin (24%,
P > 0.05). Previous study showed the recovery of motor ability was
not always in accordance with tissue injury reduction (Ruscher

et al., 2012). In our research, the result of the TTC stain shows 1 day
after treatment performed an obvious reduction of ischemia volume, the mNSS score also decreased, but did not arrive at signiﬁcant level. That might because the MCAO model has damaged a
huge part of the corresponding part of brain, including a big part of
motor areas, even the reduction of ischemia volume after 1 day
treatment, it can hardly recovered for such short time in the badly
hurting area, so the improvement of the motor ability was not so
obvious in our data. Maintaining 7 days treatment of puerarin or
vehicle, the ischemia volumes were reduced more in both the
median and high dose group (by 33%e8%, 14%e2%). Previous study
had shown that the effective concentration of puerarin is 50 mg/kg
or 100 mg/kg (Chang et al., 2009; Pan and Li, 2008). In our study, we

found that puerarin played a role in protection in much lower
concentrations (7.86 mg/kge23.59 mg/kg). Results here indicated a
low concentration of puerarin could pass the bloodebrain barrier
and delivered into the brain. The dosage of puerarin that passes the
bloodebrain barrier do not increase companied with the increased
concentration, and exerts the identical effect.
Cerebral I/R triggers several molecular mechanisms including
apoptosis, oxidative stress and inﬂammatory response, and
consequently causes irreversible damages to cerebral tissues and
even death, astrocyte is a major victim in this injury. Puerarin posttreatment could reduce the infarct size and cell apoptosis, increase
the number of astrocyte cells in vivo, and decrease apoptosis
astrocyte cell numbers in vitro. The protective effects of puerarin

are not restricted to an early time-point (22 h after reperfusion);
but also happen at a longer period after injury (7 days after
reperfusion). This indicates that the neuroprotective effects of
puerarin can be sustained, which in turn inhibit most of the deleterious consequences of cerebral I/R injury and therefore enhance
survival. Further to this observation, we looked into the underlying
mechanisms of puerarin’s neuroprotective effects associated with
astrocyte protection in cerebral I/R, which has not been studied
previously. Astrocytes are the most numerous cell type in the
central nervous system. They provide structural, trophic, and
metabolic support to neurons and modulate synaptic activity
(Kimelberg and Norenberg, 1989). Accordingly, impairment in
these astrocyte functions during brain ischemia and other insults
can critically inﬂuence neuron survival. Astrocytes release a variety

of trophic factors under normal conditions, and these are likely to
inﬂuence neuronal survival and plasticity after brain injury. These
trophic factors include nerve growth factor, basic ﬁbroblast growth
factor, transforming growth factor-b, platelet-derived growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and others (Chen and
Swanson, 2003). More recently, astrocytes were suggested as an
alternative source for neuronal replacement in neurological diseases (Robel et al., 2011). In our results, GFAP positive cells were
increased in dose-dependence, this indicated that the protective
effect of puerarin was related to the activation and regeneration of
astrocyte, which is beneﬁcial to stroke.
The majority of astrocyte cells in ischemic penumbra die by
apoptosis after cerebral ischemia (Zhan et al., 2010). AKT and BCL-2
play important roles in modulating the intracellular apoptotic

signaling pathways. The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
is an upstream mediator of the BCL-2 family. AKT inhibits apoptosis
by phosphorylating the pro-apoptotic protein Bad, which then
dissociates from the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 and Bcl-xL, and
eventually suppresses the release of cytochrome c (White et al.,
2000). However, the level of P-AKT is decreased after cerebral I/R
injury, implying a decrease of antiapoptotic activity in the brain
(Noshita et al., 2001). Indeed, neuroprotective agents that enhance
phosphorylation of AKT and BCL-2 expression or prevent downregulation of BCL-2 are beneﬁcial to cerebral I/R or stroke situations (Li et al., 2012). In the present study, puerarin post-treatment
increased the number of astrocyte in the injury part of the brain,
BCL-2 and P-AKT expression were also upregulated in astrocyte
in vitro. Our data imply that puerarin diminishes astrocyte
apoptosis probably by phosphorylating AKT and hence activating
BCL-2 expression.

To determine whether ERK activation is a major contributor to
puerarin against astrocyte apoptosis induced by OGD-R, we
therefore investigated the phosphorylation of ERK on OGD-R cells
treated with puerarin. Treatment with puerarin signiﬁcantly
increased the expression of P-ERK compared to the vehicle-treated
cells. Then we further examined the expression of P-ERK downstream signaling proteins. Results showed decreased protein level
of BCL-2 and increased protein levels of BAX in astrocyte cells after
OGD-R. Interestingly, puerarin treatment was associated with
remarkable upregulation of BCL-2 and downregulation of BAX
proteins both in vitro and in vivo. It is reported that BDNF can inhibit
the caspase-3 activation and cell apoptosis caused by hypoxiaischemic injury in vivo (Han and Holtzman, 2000). There was also
a study clariﬁed that the protective effect of BDNF in hippocampal
neurons against apoptosis was mediated by the PI3eK and the Ras/
MAPK signaling pathways, and involves a long term change in
protein synthesis (Almeida et al., 2005).
BDNF is required for proliferation of neural precursors and
survival through Ras/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathway (Almeida et al.,
2005). In our study, puerarin upregulated the protein level of
BDNF in astrocyte cells. This result is in accordance with the previous study in BDNF anti-apoptosis function (Almeida et al., 2005;
Han and Holtzman, 2000). So we inferred that puerarin could increase the secret of BDNF of astrocyte cells, meanwhile BCL-2 was
increased, both the two increasing factors induced the PI3eK and
the Ras/MAPK signaling pathways, thus protected astrocyte cells
from OGD-R injury, recovered the function of the damaged brain.
In conclusion, astrocytes apoptosis was a major injury in cerebral I/R injury. Puerarin post-treatment could reduce the apoptosis
of astrocyte of cerebral I/R injury by modulating several aspects,
including apoptosis related factors, BDNF, PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK
signaling pathways. The recovered astrocyte provided helpful
repairing conditions thus accelerate the recovery of the suffered
brain function. Therefore, this agent offers not only the heart protection but great promise in the recovery therapies for cerebral
ischemia in patients after stroke.
