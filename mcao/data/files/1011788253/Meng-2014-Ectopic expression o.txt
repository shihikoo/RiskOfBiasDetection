increased cerebral blood ﬂow and metabolism in the
tissues surrounding focal brain infarcts (Marshall et al.,
2009; Lin et al., 2010). These data suggest that the
restoration of cerebral microvascular circulation is
important for functional recovery after stroke. Late
restoration of cerebral microcirculatory ﬂow may involve
increased collateral circulation and angiogenesis in the
penumbra (Zhang et al., 2000; Zhang and Chopp, 2002;
Nishimura et al., 2010). However, the substances
responsible for inducing the formation of new blood
vessels in ischemic brain remain to be identiﬁed.
Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) plays an essential role in
physiological and pathological angiogenesis during
embryonic and postnatal life (Brindle et al., 2006; Al
Sabti, 2007). Ang1 has been identiﬁed as a ligand for
the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie-2 which expressed on
endothelial cells and hematopoietic stem cells (Suri
et al., 1996). Ang1 has little eﬀect on the proliferation,
but induces the migration, sprouting, chemotaxis,
survival, and network formation of endothelial cells
(Koblizek et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2000;
Papapetropoulos et al., 2000; Takakura et al., 2000; Ng
et al., 2011; Oubaha et al., 2012). Moreover, Ang1 is
essential for vascular maturation and stabilization via
endothelial attachment to extracellular matrices (Suri
et al., 1998; Thurston et al., 1999, 2000). Ectopic Ang1
expression signiﬁcantly enhanced neovascularization
in vivo (Shyu et al., 1988).
Although Ang1 could protect peripheral vasculature
from vascular leakage following ischemic injury, the role
of Ang1 in long-term neurological recovery after
ischemic stroke remains elusive. In this study, we
investigated whether Ang1 overexpression enhances
neurovascular remodeling and improves long-term
functional outcome in a rat model of permanent focal
cerebral ischemia. Recombinant lentiviral vector was
used to deliver Ang1 to the brain and achieve eﬃcient
Ang1 expression over a long period. Our results showed
that Ang1 overexpression confers improved neurological
behavior and reduced infarction volume, and protects
against blood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage. Furthermore,
Ang1 overexpression increases vascular density and
accelerates endogenous neuronal diﬀerentiation.

Abstract—Neuropathologic processes such as cerebral
ischemia can enhance neurogenesis. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1)
emerges as a critical regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis during embryonic and postnatal life.
Although Ang1 could protect peripheral vasculature from
vascular leakage following ischemic injury, the role of Ang1
in long-term neurological recovery after ischemic stroke
remains elusive. This study aims to examine whether Ang1
overexpression via lentivirus-mediated gene transfer
enhances neurovascular remodeling and improves functional outcome in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.
Our results demonstrated that lentivirus-mediated Ang1 gene
transfer led to improved neurological behavior and reduced
infarction volume, and protected against blood–brain barrier
(BBB) leakage in the ischemic rats. In addition, we revealed
that these eﬀects of Ang1 are related to the ability of Ang1
to increase vascular density and accelerate endogenous neuronal diﬀerentiation. These ﬁndings suggest that Ang1 is a
promising agent for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.

INTRODUCTION
Functional neurological recovery is often incomplete in
patients who survive a stroke (Davis et al., 1996; Pons,
1998; Ortega and Jolkkonen, 2013). Stroke patients with
a higher density of blood vessels appear to have
reduced morbidity and longer survival (Arenillas et al.,
2007). Functional imaging of stroke patients showed

Institutes of Health, and the experimental protocol was
approved by the Animal and Ethics Review Committee
at the Peking University Health Sciences Center
(Beijing, China). Every eﬀort was made to minimize
animal suﬀering and reduce the number of animals used.
Lentivirus construction and production
For the construction of Ang1 expression lentiviral vector,
cDNA
encoding
human
Ang1
(Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals, Tarrytown, NK, USA) was inserted into
SwaI and PacI sites of lentivirus-TG006 plasmid, forming
recombinant Ang1 lentiviral vector (Fig. 1A). 293T cells
were plated at 6  106 cells per 100-mm dish and
incubated overnight, and transfected with Ang1 lentiviral
vector or empty lentivirus-TG006 vector (12 mg) and
packaging plasmids MD.G (4 mg) and CMVDR8.91
(16 mg) by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Viral supernatants were harvested on two
consecutive days 24 h after transfection. A total of 30 ml
of supernatant was typically harvested per virus. The
supernatants were ﬁltered through a 0.45-lm syringe
ﬁlter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and loaded into a
Backman Centrifugal Filter (Beckman, California, USA) to
be
concentrated
approximately
10,000-fold
by
centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. Viral
concentrates were stored at 80 °C.
Lentivirus infection
Brieﬂy, Sprague–Dawley male rats (weight 180–230 g)
were placed in a stereotactic frame (David Kopf
Instrument, Tujunga, USA) under anesthesia, with
reference to Paxinos and Watson’s Rat Brain map
(Paxinos et al., 1980), 0.8 mm posterior to the bregma,
1.5 mm lateral to the midline, a burr hole was drilled
2.5 mm lateral to the sagittal suture and 1 mm posterior
to the coronal suture. A 10-ll Hamilton syringe was
slowly inserted into the right lateral ventricle (4.5 mm
ventral to the surface of the skull). Five microliters of
viral suspension containing 2  109 particles was
injected into the right hemisphere. The rats were
injected intraperitoneally with 3 ml of sterile 25%
mannitol in 0.9% saline per 100 g body weight 15 min
before intracerebral vector injection. On 3, 7, 10, 14 and
21 days after injection, animals were anesthetized and
killed by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital then
subjected to intracardiac perfusion of ice-cold 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brain was removed,
post-ﬁxed, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS and
embedded in TissuTek. Cryostat sections (20 lm) were
collected on the slides, and then GFP expression was
analyzed by immunoﬂuorescence staining.
Infection eﬃciency of Tie2 siRNA
The siRNA of rat Tie2 was purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Inc. (Rockford, IL, USA) (Xu et al., 2012).
Non-silencing siRNA that had no sequence homology to
any known rattus genes was used as the control. To test
if the siRNAs could be successfully transfected into the

brain tissues following intracerebroventricular injection, a
ﬂuorescence conjugated siRNA (Santa Cruz, Texas,
USA; sc-36869) was used immediately after MACO in the
pilot experiments. At 24 h after injection, the animals
were anesthetized and sacriﬁced by intracardiac
perfusion of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The
brain was removed, post-ﬁxed, cryoprotected in 30%
sucrose in PBS and embedded in TissueTek. Cryostat
sections (20 lm) were collected on slides and observed
under a ﬂuorescence microscope. siRNA was injected
one week before the lentivirus infection.
Animal stroke model
The animals were fasted overnight with free access to
water. The body weight for each rat was calculated prior
to surgery. Anesthesia was induced with ketamine
(80 mg/kg IP) followed by atropine at a dose of
0.1 mg/kg. A heating pad and a heating lamp were used
to maintain rectal temperature between 36.5 °C and
37.5 °C. Rats were intubated, and respiration was
maintained with a small animal respirator (Harvard
Apparatus). Rats were subjected to middle cerebral
artery (MCA) occlusion as previously described (Longa
et al., 1989) with some modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, the right
common carotid, internal carotid and external carotid
arteries were surgically exposed. The external carotid
artery was then isolated and coagulated. A 4–0 nylon
suture with silicon was inserted into the internal carotid
artery through the external carotid artery stump and
gently advanced to occlude the MCA. The mean arterial
blood pressure, heart rate, arterial blood gases, and
blood glucose levels before, during, and after ischemia
were analyzed. After 2 h of MCA occlusion (MCAO), the
suture was carefully removed to restore blood ﬂow, the
neck incision was closed and the rats were allowed to
recover. The body temperature was carefully monitored
during the postoperative period until the animal had
completely recovered from the anesthetic. After the
experiment, animals were housed individually until
euthanized. Following surgery, all animals had free
access to food and water.
Behavioral tests
A set of behavioral tests was performed 1 day before
MCAO (as baseline values) and 14 days after MCAO by
an investigator blinded to the experimental groups.
Corner test
Corner test was used to detect sensorimotor and postural
asymmetries (Zhang et al., 2002). Rats were placed
between the two angled boards facing the corner. When
entering deep into the corner, the vibrissae on both
sides were stimulated simultaneously. The rats would
then rear forward and upward, and then turn back to
face the open end. The nonischemic animals would turn
back from either left or right randomly. The ischemic
animals would preferentially turn toward the ipsilateral
side. The number of turns taken to each side was
recorded from 10 trials for each test. Turning

movements that were not part of a rearing movement
were not scored. Data were presented as normalized
turn ratio out of 10 trials.
Body asymmetry test
To measure motor asymmetry, rats were examined by
elevated body swing test as described (Borlongan et al.,
1998). Rats were examined for head swings while being
suspended by their tails. The direction of the swing,
either right or left, was recorded when the rat turned its
head sideways by approximately at a 10° angle to the
body’s midline. After each swing, the rat was allowed to
move freely in a Plexiglas box for at least 30 s before
taking the next test. The trials were repeated 20 times
for each animal. The frequency of head swings toward
the contralateral side was counted and normalized as
follows: (number of lateral swings in 20 tests 
10)/10  100%.
Neurological scores and mortality
The neurological scores were evaluated 24 h after MCAO
using a scoring system reported previously (Garcia et al.,
1995) with some modiﬁcations. The neurological
examination was performed in a blinded fashion. The
score given to each rat at the completion of the
evaluation was the summation of all six individual test
scores (Spontaneous Activity; Symmetry in the
Movement of Four Limbs; Forepaw Outstretching;
Climbing; Body Proprioception, and Response to
Vibrissae Touch). The minimum neurological score was
3 and the maximum was 18. The mortality rate was
calculated at the same time point, as well as the
immediate intraoperative mortality.

heparinized saline solution (10 IU/ml) 22 h after
reperfusion. Brains were removed and hemispheres
were separated. Each hemisphere was homogenized in
1 ml of 0.1 mol/L PBS and then centrifuged at 1000g for
15 min, and 0.7 ml of 100% trichloroacetic acid was
added into 0.7 ml of the supernatant. The mixture was
incubated at 4 °C for 18 h and then centrifuged at 1000g
for 30 min. The amount of Evans Blue in the
supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically at
610 nm and determined by comparison with readings
obtained from standard solutions. Data were expressed
as lg Evans Blue/g tissue.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Ang1 level in the brain tissues was determined by using
human Ang1 ELISA kit (R&D System, Minneapolis,
MN). Protein concentration was estimated using the
method of Bradford (Mullins et al., 2013) with bovine
serum albumin as a standard. MCAO rats were
sacriﬁced and decapitated, and brains were removed 3,
7, 10, 14 and 21 days post-transplantation. Under a
stereomicroscope, septum was removed from the fore
part of the brain with small forceps. The brain tissue,
containing the SVZ (subventricular zone) and periinfarction sites, were microdissected using small forceps
and cleared out of contaminating corpus callosum. The
collected samples were homogenized in lysis buﬀer
(137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1% NP40, 10%
glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml
leupeptin and 0.5 mM sodium vanadate). After
centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 min the supernatants
were used for ELISA.
Western blot analysis

TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) staining and
the evaluation of infarction volume
24 h and 14 days after MCAO, rats (n = 5 for each group)
were deeply anesthetized with ketamine and then
decapitated, the brains were rapidly removed and sliced
into 2-mm-thick coronal sections in an adult rat brain
matrix (Kent Scientiﬁc Corporation, Connecticut, USA).
The slices were stained in 2% TTC (Sigma, St, Louis,
USA) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark (Yin et al., 2003).
The infarction area and hemisphere area of each section
were traced and measured using an image analysis
system (Imaging-Pro-Plus, OLYMPUS) as described
previously (Gao et al., 2006) with some modiﬁcations.
The possible interference of brain edema to infarct
volume was corrected by standard methods (contralateral
hemisphere volume  volume of nonischemic ipsilateral
hemisphere), with infracted volume expressed as a
percentage of the contralateral hemisphere.
Evans Blue extravasation
BBB permeability was assessed by measuring Evans
Blue extravasation (Gursoy-Ozdemir et al., 2000).
Evans Blue (Sigma, 0.1 ml of 4% solution) was injected
into the femoral vein at reperfusion (2 h after occlusion).
Rats (n = 5) were transcardially perfused with 100 ml of

Rats were sacriﬁced and decapitated, the brains were
removed and the right brain hemisphere containing
hemorrhage lesion/viral injection sites were dissected
and homogenized in lysis buﬀer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH
8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1%
Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Roche). Total protein concentration of the
lysates was determined by the Bradford assay. Protein
lysates from the brain tissues (20 lg) were separated
by
sodium
dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk for 1 h
at room temperature, the membranes were incubated
overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies for NF-L
(1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), bIII-tubulin (1:1000,
Abcam), GFAP (1:1000, Santa Cruz), ZO1 (1:500,
Santa Cruz) and b-actin (1:1000, Santa Cruz). After
extensive wash with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20,
the membranes were incubated with secondary
antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 or IRdye 800
(1:5000, Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertville, PA,
USA) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes
were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20
and scanned with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System
(Li-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) by setting the

139

detection channels at 700 nm (for Alexa Fluor 680) and
800 nm (for IRDye 800CW). Scanned bands were
quantiﬁed using the Odyssey software.
BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) incorporation assay
Cell proliferation was detected by using BrdU kit
(Boehringer Mannheim, Tokyo, Japan). Brieﬂy, BrdU
was dissolved in 0.9% sterile NaCl and ﬁltered at
0.22 lm, then was injected at 50 mg/kg (concentration
of 10 mg/mL) intraperitoneally in all rat groups.
Injections were given 7 days after ischemic insult when
cell proliferation was at the peak after ischemia
(Takasawa et al., 2002; Briones et al., 2005).
Morphological assessment
At the end of the experiment for 24 h or 14 days of MCAO,
20 rats (5 rats in each group) were anesthetized and
transcardiaclly
perfused
with
PBS
and
10%
paraformaldehyde as described previously (Yin et al.,
2003). Brains were quickly removed and post-ﬁxed in
4% paraformaldehyde overnight and in 30% sucrose for
3 days. Coronal tissue sections (20 lm thick) were cut
with a cryostat (Leica CM1850). Sections were ﬁxed in
4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min
followed by permeabilization with PBS containing 0.5%
Triton X-100 for 15 min. After washing with PBS, the
sections were incubated with primary antibodies for
GFP (1:100, Bioworld, Minnesota, USA), VIII factor
(1:200, Abcam), Nestin (1:200, Santa Cruz), bIII-tubulin
(1:300, Abcam) and GFAP (1:200, Santa Cruz). After
washing, the slides were incubated with the rhodaminelabeled anti-mouse IgG antibody and ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanatelabeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody as
secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA,
USA) at room temperature for 60 min. After washing,
the cells were mounted with ﬂuorescence mounting
medium (Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) containing 40,
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and analyzed on a
Leica confocal laser scanning microscope. Five
randomly selected areas from each slide were examined
for the rate of neuronal diﬀerentiation under
ﬂuorescence microscope by three independent, blinded
investigators.
For double labeling of BrdU and the diﬀerent cell
markers, sections were incubated with an anti-BrdU
antibody (1:100, Bioworld) and antibodies for each cell
marker at 4 °C overnight after DNA denaturation. Brieﬂy,
sections were incubated in 2 N HCl at 37 °C for 30 min.
Sections were then rinsed in borate buﬀer (pH 8.5) for
15 min. Immunostaining was performed as described
above.
Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean ± SD. Comparisons
among the groups were performed by using a one-way
analysis of variance followed by Fisher protected least
signiﬁcant diﬀerence test, as appropriate. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
Physiological data
No statistical diﬀerences were observed in the Sham/
PBS/TG006/TG006-Ang1/Control siRNA/Tie2 siRNA
groups with regard to mean arterial blood pressure,
heart rate, arterial blood gases, or glucose levels before,
during, or after ischemia (data not shown).
Lentivirus mediated overexpression of Ang1 in the
brain
To determine whether intraparenchymal lentivirus
injection leads to successful gene transduction and
expression, we ﬁrst examined the extent of GFP
expression in rats after lentivirus-Ang1 infection. As
shown in Fig. 1B, a robust GFP signal was observed
adjacent and distal to the injection tract as well as in the
peri-infarction region 3 weeks after MCAO. We also
investigated the nature of cells expressing Ang1 by
double labeling of GFP and the diﬀerent cell markers.
We observed Ang1 expression in neurons, astrocytes
and endothelial cells 14 days after the administration of
lentivirus-Ang1 (Fig. 1C).
Furthermore, ELISA showed that lentivirus-Ang1
administration resulted in increased Ang1 protein level
compared with lentivirus-TG006 administration 3 weeks
after injection in peri-infarction sites and SVZ (Fig. 1D–
E, P < 0.01). These data indicate that lentivirus
eﬃciently delivered Ang1 to a large area of the cerebral
hemisphere, not limited to the injection sites, with a
prolonged expression period.
Ang1 overexpression improves neurological
behavior and reduces infarction volume after cerebral
ischemia
Next we investigated whether Ang1 overexpression would
improve neurological function after ischemic stroke. Two
weeks after lentivirus-mediated gene transfer, rats were
subjected to ischemic injury by MCAO. Rats with
lentivirus-Ang1
transduction
showed
dramatically
improved motor performance compared with the stroke
rats treated with lentivirus-TG006 or PBS, but Tie2
siRNA could partially antagonize the eﬀects of lentivirusAng1, as assessed by corner test and body asymmetry
trials (Fig. 2A, B, P < 0.05). The neurological score at
24 h after MCAO was 17 ± 1 in sham group, 7 ± 1 in
PBS group, 7 ± 1 in lentivirus-TG006 group, 11 ± 1 in
lentivirus-Ang1 groups, 11 ± 1 in control siRNA group,
and 9 ± 1 in Tie2 siRNA group. Fourteen days after
MCAO, the neurological score was 17 ± 1 in sham
group, 11 ± 1 in PBS group, 10 ± 1 in lentivirus-TG006
group, 15 ± 2 in lentivirus-Ang1 groups, 15 ± 1 in
control siRNA group, and 13 ± 1 in Tie2 siRNA group
(Fig. 2C). Lentivirus-Ang1 treatment increased the
neurological
scores
signiﬁcantly
(P < 0.05).
Furthermore, lentivirus-Ang1 treatment signiﬁcantly
reduced the infarct volume compared with lentivirusTG006 or PBS treatment. Cerebral infarction in TTCstained brain sections at 24 h and 14 d after MCAO is
shown in Fig. 3A, B. The white-colored areas

treatment. (B) In the body asymmetry test, rats displayed more frequent turns toward the contralateral side after MCAO. Stroke rats administrated
with lentivirus-Ang1 transduction showed signiﬁcantly decreased biased swing activity compared with stroke rats administrated with lentivirusTG006 or PBS injection. Meanwhile biased swing activity was partially decreased by Tie2 siRNA treatment. (C) Neurological scores. Grades of 3 to

Statistical analysis of the severity of infarction showed a
signiﬁcant decrease in infarct volume in lentivirus-Ang1
group compared with lentivirus-TG006 or PBS treatment
groups (Fig. 3C, lentivirus-Ang1 versus lentivirus-TG006

brain tissue, respectively (Fig. 3E). There was a
signiﬁcant decrease in BBB permeability in lentivirusAng1 group compared with lentivirus-TG006 and PBS
groups (P < 0.01). EB particles were observed as red
ﬂuorescence under a ﬂuorescence microscope. A
considerable EB leakage was visualized in the cortex of
lentivirus-TG006 and PBS groups but not in lentivirusAng1 group. Furthermore, Western blot analysis showed
that gap junction protein ZO1 level was higher in Ang1
group than in lentivirus-TG006 or PBS groups (Fig. 3F–G).

Ang1 overexpression protects against BBB leakage
To examine the eﬀect of lentivirus-Ang1 administration on
BBB leakage and the incidence of hemorrhagic
transformation, rats were sacriﬁced at 24 h after MCAO.
After 24 h of reperfusion, EB was clearly observed in the
ipsilateral hemisphere of whole brain coronal sections
(Fig. 3D). EB content of the brain tissue from lentivirusAng1,
lentivirus-TG006
and
PBS
groups
was

Ang1 overexpression increases vascular density and
promotes angiogenesis
BrdU labeling assay and immunohistochemical analysis
of vascular endothelial cell marker VIII factor showed
increased endothelial cell proliferation in the penumbra
of lentivirus-Ang1 treated hemispheres (5 ± 1 at 7 days,
number of new blood vessels/ﬁeld) compared with

lentivirus-Ang1 treatment vs. lentivirus-TG006, PBS or Sham injection groups 24 h and 14 days after MCAO. The white-colored areas represented
the infarct regions and the red-colored areas represented normal areas. Severe infarction was shown in lentivirus-TG006 or PBS-treated rats.
Lentivirus-Ang1 treatment decreased the infarct volume sharply, especially in the cortex. (C) Statistical analysis of the severity of infarction. There
was a signiﬁcant decrease in infarct volume in lentivirus-Ang1 group compared with lentivirus-TG006 or PBS treatment group (n = 5, P < 0.05).
The inﬂuence of edema on infarct volume was corrected using standard methods: contralateral hemisphere volume  volume of nonischemic
ipsilateral hemisphere, with infracted volume expressed as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere. Values were expressed as
means ± SEM. P < 0.05 versus lentivirus-TG006 or PBS injection, n = 5 animals per group. (D) Representative images of Evan’s Blue (EB)stained brain sections from rats killed 24 h after MCAO. Intense staining was seen in the ischemic area in lentivirus-TG006 and PBS groups.
However, lentivirus-Ang1 treated rats showed weak EB staining in infarct areas. (E) Statistical analysis of the severity of EB extravasation. Vascular
leakage was determined by measuring the amount of brain-extracted EB at 620 nm and expressed as lg/g brain tissue. Lentivirus-Ang1 group

data indicate that Ang1 promotes endogenous
endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis.
Ang1 overexpression enhances neurogenesis
To examine whether Ang1 overexpression enhances
neural progenitor cell proliferation, we performed BrdU
labeling assay and immunohistochemical analysis of
Nestin (a marker for neural progenitor cells). The results
showed that 7 days after MCAO, in SVZ and peri-

infarction sites there was a signiﬁcant increase in BrdU/
Nestin labeled cells in lentivirus-Ang1 group compared
with lentivirus-TG006 and PBS groups (Fig 4C, D,
23 ± 3 versus 12 ± 2 and 11 ± 3, respectively,
P < 0.05, cells/ﬁeld).
To examine whether Ang1 overexpression enhances
neuronal diﬀerentiation, we performed immunohistochemical
analysis of bIII-tubulin (a marker for neurons) and GFAP (a
marker for astrocytes). In peri-infarction sites 14 days
after MCAO, bIII-tubulin-positive cells were signiﬁcantly
increased in lentivirus-Ang1 group compared with
lentivirus-TG006 and PBS groups (Fig. 5A, B, 52 ± 5

similar in the three groups (Fig. 5C, D, 46 ± 6 versus
39 ± 8 and 45 ± 7 respectively, P < 0.05, cells/ﬁeld).
Western blot analysis conﬁrmed the results of
immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 6). Taken together,
these data indicate that endogenous neurogenesis is
induced by ischemic injury, and Ang1 accelerates
endogenous neuronal diﬀerentiation.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate
that Ang1 gene transfer eﬀectively improved the
functional outcome in chronic stage of cerebral
infarction. The improved functional outcome was

coupled
with
enhanced
angiogenesis
and
neurogenesis. These results are consistent with
previous studies showing that Ang1 stimulated
neurogenesis by promoting neuronal diﬀerentiation and
neurite outgrowth in NPCs in vitro (Bai et al., 2009;
Rosa et al., 2010).
Endogenous Ang1 level is upregulated by cerebral
ischemia and oxygen deﬁciency, suggesting that Ang1
may mediate endogenous protection or repair in an
ischemic lesion. Endogenously elevated Ang1 may not
be suﬃcient to counteract the injury, and therapeutic
administration is needed to augment the trophic support
to sustain long-term stroke protection.
However, the eﬀects of Ang1 treatment on the shortterm and long-term neurological functions after ischemic
stroke have not been reported. In this study, we used

lentivirus to achieve sustained Ang1 overexpression in
ischemic hemisphere. The advantage of gene transfer is
that a single injection of vector can lead to eﬃcient
production of proteins over a widely distributed target
area for an extended period of time. Thus, gene transfer
oﬀers signiﬁcant advantages over other approaches that
rely on the repeated administration of the agents. These
advantages include more widespread coverage and
simplicity of long-term protein expression. In addition,
compared with other viral vectors such as adenovirus,
lentivirus has several advantages such as low
immunogenicity and the ability to mediate long-term
expression.

Ang1 overexpression was sustained for at least
5 weeks after lentivirus transfer. We demonstrated that
Ang1 overexpression eﬀectively enhanced motor
function 2 weeks after MCAO, compared with TG006
or
PBS
treatment.
The
improved
behavior
performances are correlated with a reduction in strokeinduced brain atrophy. Interestingly, we found that Tie2
siRNA could only partially antagonize the protective
eﬀects of Ang1, suggesting that the eﬀects of Ang1 is
not completely mediated by Tie2 receptor. This
observation is consistent with the report that Ang1
could activate integrin signaling (Cascone et al., 2005;
Hall et al., 2006).

NF-L (a neuronal marker), GFAP (an astrocyte marker) in MCAO brains injected with lentivirus-Ang1, lentivirus-TG006 or PBS. Signiﬁcantly higher
expression of bIII-tubulin and NF-L was found in lentivirus-Ang1 group at 24 h and 14 days after MCAO. In MCAO animals injected with lentivirusTG006 and PBS, the expression of bIII-tubulin and NF-L proteins was not markedly increased. GFAP protein was not markedly diﬀerent at 24 h or
14 days after MCAO in the three groups. (B–D) Densitometric analysis of the immunoblots. Ratio for PBS control was arbitrarily presented as 1.

The breakdown of the BBB after stroke can result in
hemorrhage and edema and ultimately neuronal cell
death due to the lack of blood ﬂow (Rosenberg et al.,
1998; Alﬁeri et al., 2013; Dzietko et al., 2013; Huang
et al., 2013). Previous studies showed that Ang1 plays a
stabilizing role in the maintenance of normal BBB integrity
in the adult brain. In this study we found that the leakage
of EB content in the ipsilateral hemisphere was
signiﬁcantly reduced in Ang1 treated rats. In addition to
its eﬀects on angiogenesis, Ang1 protects adult
vasculature from vascular leakage, which may account
for its anti-edematic eﬀects after cerebral ischemia.
Overexpression of Ang1 inhibits vascular leakage
induced by VEGF or inﬂammatory agents, suggesting
that Ang1 counters the eﬀect of VEGF on vascular
permeability (Thurston et al., 1999, 2000). Thus we
postulate that Ang1 plays an important role in the
protection of BBB after brain ischemia. When we
injected EB into the rats within 24 h after MCAO to
simulate its potential clinical use, TTC staining showed
that the protection appeared to be restricted primarily to
the cortex as would be expected because the treatment
primarily protected the penumbra.
Recent evidence demonstrated that ischemic areas in
cerebral ischemia animal models showed not only
angiogenesis, but also a process similar to fetal blood

tube formation, suggesting that Ang1 and its receptor
play an important role in adult angiogenesis in addition
to its role in fetal angiogenesis (Zhang and Chopp,
2002). Ang1 and VEGF have similar functions. They are
expressed in synergy during embryonic development
and a variety of pathological processes, to participate in
the regulation of angiogenesis. Vascular cells secrete
trophic factors such as stromacell-derived factor 1
(SDF-1) or Ang1 to promote neural progenitor cells to
proliferate and migrate to damaged regions (Isner and
Asahara,
1999).
Taken
together,
enhanced
neovascularization and neurogenesis could be the
essential mechanisms by which Ang1 enhances
functional recovery after MCAO. Vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis implement the formation of vascular
network in the embryo. Angiogenesis comprises two
diﬀerent mechanisms: endothelial sprouting and
intussusceptive microvascular growth (IMG), and the
sprouting process is based on endothelial cell migration,
proliferation and tube formation, while IMG divides
existing vessel lumens by the formation and insertion of
tissue folds and columns of interstitial tissue into the
vessel lumen (Ohab et al., 2006; Font et al., 2010).
Although Ang1 is an angiogenic factor to mediate
vascular growth in the developing and adult brain, its
role in vascular remolding after cerebral ischemia has

Z. Meng et al. / Neuroscience 267 (2014) 135–146

not been explored. Our data show that Ang1 treatment
produced increased microvessels in the peri-infarction
region along with increased local blood ﬂow. Improved
microcirculation is likely to enhance neuron survival,
support neurogenesis, and aid the removal of necrotic
brain tissue to facilitate the repair process, ultimately
leading to long-term functional recovery. Consistent with
our results, several studies have suggested that
enhancing local tissue Ang1 and VEGF expression may
facilitate the clinical treatment of ischemic disease by
improving local vessel organizations close to the
damaged structure and the relative maturity of local
blood vessels, thus returning the tissue to its
physiological state (Chen et al., 2007; Shujia et al.,
2008; Matsuo et al., 2013).
In this study, lentivirus-Ang1 was injected before
MCAO to allow maximal expression of Ang1. However,
pretreatment is of interest primarily as proof of concept
that Ang1 transduction could promote long-lasting
functional recovery after cerebral infarction. In addition
to enhanced angiogenesis and neurogenesis, the
improved neurological function and reduced brain
atrophy could also be contributed to the neuroprotective
eﬀects of Ang1 in the acute phase of stroke. Because
the acute neuroprotective action of Ang1 has been well
demonstrated, in the present study, we focused our
eﬀort on neural regenerative eﬀects of Ang1. Targeting
the neurovascular unit with neurotrophic and angiogenic
Ang1 may represent a novel regenerative paradigm for
the patients with stroke. Future experiments are needed
to assess the restorative eﬀects of Ang1 by
postischemic gene transfer.

CONCLUSIONS
For the ﬁrst time this study demonstrated that lentivirusmediated Ang1 gene transfer confers improved
neurological behavior and reduced infarction volume,
and protects against BBB leakage in rat model of
ischemic stroke. In addition, we revealed that these
eﬀects of Ang1 are related to the ability of Ang1 to
increase vascular density and accelerate endogenous
neuronal diﬀerentiation. These ﬁndings suggest that
Ang1 is a promising agent for the prevention and
treatment of cerebral ischemia.
