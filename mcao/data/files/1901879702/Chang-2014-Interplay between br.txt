Pressor response after stroke commonly leads to early death or susceptibility to stroke recurrence, and detailed
mechanisms are still lacking. We assessed the hypothesis that the renin–angiotensin system contributes to pressor
response after stroke by differential modulation of the pro-inﬂammatory chemokine monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP-1) in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a key brain stem site that maintains blood pressure. We also investigated the beneﬁcial effects of a novel renin inhibitor, aliskiren, against stroke-elicited pressor
response. Experiments were performed in male adult Sprague–Dawley rats. Stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion elicited signiﬁcant pressor response, accompanied by activation of angiotensin II (Ang II)/type I receptor (AT1R) and AT2R signaling, depression of Ang-(1–7)/MasR and Ang IV/AT4R cascade, alongside
augmentation of MCP-1/C–C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) signaling and neuroinﬂammation in the RVLM.
Stroke-elicited pressor response was signiﬁcantly blunted by antagonism of AT1R, AT2R or MCP-1/CCR2 signaling,
and eliminated by applying Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV into the RVLM. Furthermore, stroke-activated MCP-1/CCR2 signaling was enhanced by AT1R and AT2R activation, and depressed by Ang-(1–7)/MasR and Ang IV/AT4R cascade.
Aliskiren inhibited stroke-elicited pressor response via downregulating MCP-1/CCR2 activity and reduced neuroinﬂammation in the RVLM; these effects were potentiated by Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV. We conclude that whereas Ang
II/AT1R or Ang II/AT2R signaling in the brain stem enhances, Ang-(1–7)/MasR or Ang IV/AT4R antagonizes pressor
response after stroke by differential modulations of MCP-1 in the RVLM. Furthermore, combined administration of
aliskiren and Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV into the brain stem provides more effective amelioration of stroked-induced
pressor response.

Introduction
Stroke is a major global health problem because it is the second leading cause of death worldwide (Donnan et al., 2008). Pressor response
after stroke is observed in 60–75% patients (Potter et al., 2005) and is a
common complication that leads to poor outcome, including early death
in hospital, neurological deﬁciency at discharge (Zhang et al., 2011) and
susceptibility to recurrent stroke (Geeganage et al., 2011). At present,
the causes, effects and optimal management of pressor response immediately after stroke remain a hotly debated and sometimes controversial
issue (Lattanzi et al., 2013; Sykora et al., 2010). Further delineation of
the pathophysiological mechanisms of pressor response after stroke that
leads to effective therapeutic management is therefore warranted.
The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), where sympathetic
premotor neurons in the brain stem are located, is responsible for maintaining sympathetic vasomotor tone and stable blood pressure; pharmacological or electrical activation of the RVLM elicits pressor
response (Spyer, 1994). Clinically, vascular compression of the RVLM
is identiﬁed in 26.8% of acute ischemic stroke patients who manifested
greater blood pressure variability that is related to poorer prognosis
(Aoki et al., 2011). Furthermore, rats in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model (Marks et al., 2001; Mogi et al., 2006) exhibit
disturbed cardiovascular responses because of altered neurotransmission in the ventrolateral medulla (Ally et al., 2002). MCAO also augmented Fos-like immunoreactivity in medullary neurons (Wu and
Ling, 1998). It follows that the RVLM may participate in pressor response after stroke and is a suitable target for mechanistic delineation.
The condition of up to one-third of stroke patients worsens after hospital admission, and the management of pressor response after stroke is
still controversial (Lattanzi et al., 2013; Sykora et al., 2010). Early systemic application of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reportedly prevents pressor response after stroke (Lüders, 2007) and reduces severity
(Lee et al., 2012). Other studies, however, indicate that careful blood
pressure lowering treatment with ARBs does not improve the neurological outcomes of patients with stroke (Rhoney and Moser, 2011; Sandset
et al., 2011). Whereas angiotensin II (Ang II), the principal effector molecule of the central renin–angiotensin system (RAS), induces tonic
sympathoexcitatory and pressor response by acting on Ang II type 1 receptors (AT1R) in the RVLM (Chan et al., 2007, 2010), a decrease of
AT1R in the RVLM mediates hypotension induced by lipopolysaccharide
administration (Chan et al., 2003). Recent work (Jiang et al., 2012; Faure
et al., 2006) further showed that angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang-(1–7)) and angiotensin IV (Ang IV), two metabolites when Ang II is degraded respectively by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 or aminopeptidase N
(APN) (McKinley et al., 2003), play a protective role during stroke by reducing the infarct volume and subsequent neurological deﬁcits (Faure
et al., 2006; Mecca et al., 2011). Considering the importance of the central
RAS in blood pressure homeostasis, a systematic evaluation of the roles
of Ang-(1–7) and Ang IV and their respective receptor subtypes, Mas receptor (MasR) and AT4R, in addition to Ang II and the classical AT1R and
AT2R, in the RVLM in stroke-induced pressor response is therefore of
interest.
Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), also named chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), is a pro-inﬂammatory chemokine
that exhibits potent chemoattractant activity for monocyte/macrophage
inﬁltration to the injured area, of which triggers an intense inﬂammatory reaction and contributes to worsen stroke brain injury indicated by
increased infarct size and impaired neurological outcome (Iadecola
and Alexander, 2001). Moreover, MCP-1 contributes to inﬂammatory
reactions during stroke via an action on C–C chemokine receptor 2
(CCR2) (Losy and Zaremba, 2001; Jiang et al., 2008); clinical studies indicated that polymorphism of MCP-1 gene is associated with the susceptibility to stroke (Buraczynska et al., 2010). Elevation of MCP-1 is
observed in cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) (Losy and Zaremba, 2001) or in
circulation (Arakelyan et al., 2005) of stroke patients and in brain of
rats after MCAO (Jiang et al., 2008). In addition, the level of MCP-1

293

mRNA and MCP-1 concentration in plasma is signiﬁcantly higher in hypertensive patients (Sardo et al., 2008). Of note is that Ang II induces
AT1R-mediated upregulation of MCP-1 or CCR-2, and secretion of
MCP-1 in ventricular cardiomyocytes (Omura et al., 2004) or human
U937 monocytic cells (Ko et al., 2007). It follows that brain stem MCP1 may underlie RAS-mediated pressor response after stroke.
Aliskiren, an orally active, non-peptide renin inhibitor, is an antihypertensive agent that blocks renin, the ﬁrst and rate-limiting enzymatic
step of angiotensin synthesis (Sawhney, 2010). Intracerebroventricular
(i.c.v.) infusion of aliskiren markedly inhibits the increase in Ang II levels
in rat CSF and blood pressure (BP) elicited by i.c.v. infusion of renin
(Huang et al., 2012). Furthermore, pretreatment with systemic application of aliskiren reduces the expression of inﬂammatory marker genes
in the cerebral ischemic core after MCAO (Schmerbach et al., 2010). Because of the controversy surrounding the efﬁcacy of ARBs against pressor response after stroke, whether aliskiren-mediated reduction of
inﬂammatory response presents itself as an alternative therapeutic
strategy warrants further delineation.
Employing a MCAO stroke model, the present study was undertaken
to assess the hypothesis that Ang II, Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV, and AT1R,
AT2R, MasR or AT4R, contribute to pressor response after stroke by differential modulations of pro-inﬂammatory MCP-1 in the RVLM. We also
investigated the relationship between these cellular mechanisms and
the beneﬁcial effects of aliskiren.
Materials and methods
All experimental procedures carried out in this study have been performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and were in compliance with the guidelines for care and
handling of animals set forth by that Committee.
Animals
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (285–337 g, n = 219) purchased
from the Experimental Animal Center of the National Science Council,
Taiwan, Republic of China were used. Animals were housed in groups
of 2–3 in individually ventilated cages in an AAALAC Internationalaccredited Center for Laboratory Animals, with free access to rat chow
and water. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used.
Blood pressure and heart rate measurement
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), mean BP (MBP)
and heart rate (HR) of conscious rats were measured between 0900 and
1200 h, using a non-invasive tail cuff plethysmography (Visitech Systems, Apex, NC, USA). Averages of 10 inﬂation/deﬂation cycles were
conducted to obtain MBP.
MCAO stroke model
Transient MCAO was induced by intraluminal vascular occlusion as
described previously (Marks et al., 2001; Mogi et al., 2006; Ally et al.,
2002; Wu and Ling, 1998). Brieﬂy, the left MCA in rats anesthetized
with 2–3% isoﬂurane was effectively occluded by a silicon-coated 4-0monoﬁlament (Doccol, Sharon, MA, USA) for 120 min, followed by reperfusion. Successful establishment of experimental stroke was conﬁrmed
on day 1 after MCAO by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and staining
with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma). Speciﬁcally, the
presence of edema was determined by high resolution T2 images obtained from a 9.4 T Animal MR scanner (Biospec 94/20, Bruker, Ettlingen,
Germany). For TTC staining, rats deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital
sodium were perfused intracardially with warm saline that contains

experiments, RVLM tissue samples were collected on day 3 or 7 after
MCAO following the same procedures.
Determination of mRNA levels

Evaluation of neurological functions after stroke
Two technicians blinded to the experimental groups determined
stroke-induced neurological deﬁcits of the rats based on the modiﬁed
neurological severity score (mNSS). The averaged scores graded independently on a scale of 0–14 (normal score, 0; maximal deﬁcit score,
14) were used as our ﬁnal results.

We used a RT2 proﬁler PCR array (SABiosciencesTM , Frederick,
MD, USA) to determine global changes of 84 hypertension-related
genes in the RVLM (see Supplementary Table S2 for detailed information). The mRNA levels of genes of interest and gadph control
were further quantiﬁed by real-time PCR analysis (see Supplementary Table S3 for list of primers).
Measurement of protein concentration

Microinjection or systemic administration of test agents
Microinjection bilaterally of test agents into the RVLM (stereotaxic
coordinates: 4.5–5 mm posterior to lambda, 1.8–2.1 mm lateral to midline and 8.1–8.4 mm below the dorsal surface of cerebellum), each at a
volume of 50 nl, was carried out stereotaxically and consecutively via a
glass micropipette connected to a 0.5-μl Hamilton (Reno, NV, USA)
microsyringe. Test agents used (see Supplementary Table S1 for their
pharmacological effects) included aliskiren (MedChemexpress, Shanghai, China), candesartan cilexetil (Carbosynth, Compton, Berkshire UK),
PD123319 (Tocris, Washington, DC, USA), A779 (American Peptide, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), antiserum against AT4R (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA,
USA), Ang II (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), Ang-(1–7) (Enzo Life Sciences,
Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA), Ang IV (Bachem, Bubendorf,
Switzerland), bindarit (Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA), BMS CCR2 22
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA) and propagermanium
(Sigma). Systemic administration of valsartan (Sigma) was given via
the intraperitoneal route. All test agents were dissolved in artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (aCSF), with the exception of aliskiren, candesartan,
bindarit or valsartan, which was prepared with 0.2–10% DMSO. Tests
agents and their solvents (vehicle control) were given 120 min after
MCAO. The effective doses used were adopted from previous reports
that used those test agents for the same purpose as in this study, and
were adjusted and determined in pilot study. To avoid the confounding
effects of drug interactions, each animal received only one pharmacological treatment.
Collection of tissue samples
We routinely collected tissue samples for biochemical evaluations
one day after MCAO or in sham-control animals. Animals were ﬁrst
deeply anesthetized to receive transcardiac perfusion with warm saline,
and RVLM tissues were immediately obtained by micropunch. In some

The protein concentration in cell lysate from the RVLM was determined by commercial ELISA kits, coupled with spectrophotometry.
Kits for angiotensinogen (Shanghai BlueGene Biotech, Shanghai,
China), Ang II (Biovendor, Brno, Czech Republic), Ang-(1–7) (Shanghai
BlueGene Biotech), APN (Cusabio, Wuhan, Hubei, China), MCP-1
(eBiosciences, San Diego, CA, USA), and CCR2 (Cusabio) were used.
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis for AT1R, AT2R, MasR, AT4R, c-Fos, glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP), OX-42 or β-actin was carried out on proteins
extracted from the RVLM. Rabbit polyclonal antisera against AT1R (EMD
Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA), AT2R (EMD Millipore Corporation), MasR (Biorbyt, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK), AT4R (Cell Signaling) or c-Fos (EMD Millipore Corporation) and a mouse monoclonal
antiserum against GFAP (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA),
OX-42 (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, Oxford, UK) or β-actin (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) were used as the primary antiserum, and horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden) for AT1R, AT2R, MasR or AT4R or sheep anti-mouse IgG
(Amersham Biosciences) for β-actin was used as the secondary
antiserum.
Double immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy
We employed double immunoﬂuorescence staining coupled with
laser scanning confocal microscopy to localize AT1R, AT2R, MasR,
AT4R, CCR2 or c-Fos in RVLM neurons and GFAP or OX-42 in RVLM
glia, using rabbit polyclonal antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against
AT1R (EMD Millipore Corporation), AT2R (EMD Millipore Corporation),
MasR (Biorbyt), AT4R (Cell Signaling), CCR2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
or c-Fos (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a mouse monoclonal antiserum

Results
Pressor response after MCAO
One hundred and twenty minutes of MCAO followed by reperfusion elicited a signiﬁcant elevation of MBP, SBP or DBP measured
by the tail cuff plethysmography, alongside increases of neurological
deﬁcits and decreases in body weight. All these events peaked on day
1 after stroke and progressively returned to baseline over 7 days
(Table 1); the augmented HR sustained 7 days.
Differential activation of the RAS in RVLM
Results from a hypertensive RT-PCR array, which proﬁles 84
key genes that regulate constriction and dilation of blood vessels
(Supplementary Fig. S1), revealed that the transcript level of 57
genes in the RVLM was upregulated one day after stroke, and 27

genes were downregulated. Of note is that the mRNA level of a
majority of the RAS family, including Ang II receptor type 1a
(atgr1a), atgr1b, atgr2, angiotensin converting enzyme (ace),
ace2, and renin (ren), was signiﬁcantly upregulated (Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, angiotensin isoforms and receptor subtypes
in the RVLM after stroke were targeted in our subsequent
experiments.
Time-course analysis by RT-PCR, ELISA or Western blot showed
that the augmented mRNA level of agtr1a, agtr1b or agtr2
(Fig. 1A), protein concentration of Ang II (Fig. 1B), and protein expression of AT1R or AT2R (Fig. 1C) in the RVLM peaked on day 1
after stroke. Likewise, whereas the mRNA level of mas1, agtr4 variant 1 (agtr4-v1) or agtr4-v2 exhibited a signiﬁcant increase on
days 3 and 7 (Fig. 1A), the decrease in concentration of Ang-(1–
7) and Ang IV (Fig. 1B) or protein expression of MasR and AT4R
(Fig. 1C) also peaked on post-stroke day 1. Since the most significant pressor response after stroke and changes in RAS mRNA and

Differential activation of angiotensin receptors (ATRs) in RVLM neurons
after stroke

Activation of Ang-(1–7)/MasR or Ang IV/AT4R signaling in RVLM
antagonizes pressor response after stroke

We conﬁrmed that brain damage occurred on day 1 after stroke by
the presence of brain edema in T2-weighted MRI (Fig. 2A) or by the increase in infarct volume in TTC staining (Fig. 2B). Double immunoﬂuorescence staining coupled with laser scanning confocal microscopy
revealed that the differential changes in ATRs observed in our biochemical experiments indeed occurred in RVLM neurons. Cells in the RVLM
that stained positively with the neuronal marker NeuN showed enhanced immunoreactivity of AT1R and AT2R, and reduced immunoreactivity of MasR and AT4R one day after stroke (Fig. 2C).

Linear regression analysis also showed that the increase in MBP
after stroke was signiﬁcantly and negatively correlated to the concentration of Ang-(1–7) (r2 = 0.82) and Ang IV (r 2 = 0.95)
(Fig. 2D) in the RVLM. Furthermore, pretreatment with Ang-(1–7)
(200 pmol) or Ang IV (1 nmol) signiﬁcantly antagonized or reversed
the stroke-induced increase in MBP, SBP and DBP (Fig. 3A); whereas
A779 (MasR antagonist; 500 pmol) and AT4R antiserum (1:20) were
ineffective. The stroke-induced elevation in HR was blunted by Ang(1–7), unaffected by Ang IV and potentiated by A779 and AT4R antiserum (Fig. 3A).

MCP-1 in RVLM contributes to pressor response after stroke
Linear regression analysis showed that the increase in MBP after
stroke was signiﬁcantly (r2 = 0.88) and positively correlated to the
concentration of Ang II (Fig. 2D) in the RVLM. In addition, pretreatment with microinjection bilaterally of candesartan (AT1R antagonist; 5 nmol) or PD123319 (AT2R antagonist; 5 nmol) into the
RVLM 120 min after MCAO signiﬁcantly blunted the strokeinduced increase in MBP, SBP and DBP (Fig. 3A); stroke-elicited elevation in HR was antagonized by candesartan and potentiated by
PD123319 (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, those hemodynamic parameters
were potentiated by Ang II (10 nmol) (Fig. 3A). Of note is that intraperitoneal administration of valsartan (5 or 25 mg/kg), an AT1R antagonist that acts only on peripheral AT1R because of its inability to

The mRNA level of ccl2 (Fig. 1A) and concentration of the proinﬂammatory MCP-1 (a common name for CCL2) (Fig. 1B) in the
RVLM also underwent an increase that is signiﬁcantly (r2 = 0.81) and
positively correlated with the augmented MBP after stroke (Fig. 2D).
Both the mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein levels (Fig. 1B) of CCR2 in the
RVLM, and CCR2-immunoreactivity in RVLM neurons (Fig. 2C)
remained unaltered. In addition, the stroke-induced increase in MBP,
SBP, DBP or HR was signiﬁcantly antagonized by microinjection into
the bilateral RVLM of bindarit (MCP-1 synthesis inhibitor; 10 nmol),
BMS CCR2 22 (CCR2 antagonist; 10 pmol) or propagermanium (CCR2
antagonist; 10 pmol) (Fig. 3C).

Stroke-activated MCP-1 in RVLM is differentially modulated by AT1R or
AT2R and Ang-(1–7)/MasR or Ang IV/AT4R signaling
The stroked-induced elevation of MCP-1 in the RVLM was blunted by
pretreatment with candesartan, PD123319, combination of candesartan
and PD123319, Ang-(1–7), Ang IV or bindarit, but not by A779, AT4R antiserum, combination of A779 and AT4R antiserum, BMS CCR2 22 or
propagermanium (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, whereas Ang II potentiated
the stroke-induced augmentation of MCP-1 and elevation of CCR2 concentration in the RVLM, PD123319 or combination of PD123313 and
candesartan signiﬁcantly reduced CCR2 concentration (Fig. 4B). Other
pretreatments were ineffective against CCR2 concentration in RVLM.

exacerbated the reduction of Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV induced by stroke
in the RVLM (Fig. 5A). Aliskiren also blunted the stroke-induced augmentation of MCP-1 and reduced CCR2 concentration (Fig. 5B), accompanied by an amelioration of the increase in MBP, SBP, DBP or HR. As a
control, the concentration of angiotensinogen in the RVLM was not affected by stroke or pretreatments with aliskiren (Fig. 5A), candesartan,
PD123319, A779 or AT4R antiserum (Fig. 6). Likewise, those pharmacological treatments did not change Ang II, Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV concentration in the RVLM after stroke (Fig. 6).
Aliskiren exerts beneﬁcial effects against neuronal activation and
inﬂammation in RVLM after stroke
At the cellular level, pretreatment with aliskiren (1 nmol) produced
signiﬁcant antagonism of stroke-induced neuronal activation in the
RVLM, which was indicated by reducing the increase in c-Fos immunoreactivity (c-Fos-IR) in RVLM neurons. Aliskiren similarly reduced the
activation of astrocytes and microglia, two cellular markers of

obtained from Western blot analysis (Fig. 7). Aliskiren pretreatment signiﬁcantly blunted stroked-induced augmentation of protein expression
of c-Fos, GFAP and OX-42 in the RVLM (Fig. 7).

Combined pretreatment with only half of the doses of aliskiren
(0.5 nmol) and Ang-(1–7) (100 pmol) or Ang IV (0.5 nmol) produced
signiﬁcant antagonism of the stroke-induced increase in MBP, SBP,
DBP or HR, to a degree that was comparable to or more than that elicited
by those test agents when delivered alone at full dose (cf. Fig. 3). Similar
ﬁndings were obtained for the changes in MCP-1 concentration in the
RVLM (Figs. 4 and 5).
Discussion
Pressor response after stroke predisposes early death, more severe
neurological deﬁcit and frequent recurrence of stroke. An effective therapeutic strategy is still controversial, possibly because the key mechanisms are still unidentiﬁed. The present study was undertaken to ﬁll
this void. Based on a MCAO model that mimics clinically focal transient
ischemic stroke, in conjunction with a neural substrate that is intimately
related to brain stem cardiovascular regulation but is not part of the cerebral ischemic core or penumbra, we demonstrated that upregulation
of Ang II, followed by activation of AT1R and AT2R that leads to inﬂammation indicated by an elevation of MCP-1 concentration and activation
of CCR2 accounts for the pressor response and tachycardia after stroke.
This process is exacerbated by the concurrent reduction of Ang-(1–7) or
Ang IV in the RVLM, which normally elicits depressor response by activating MasR or AT4R, leading to the downregulation of the MCP-1/CCR2
signaling pathway (Fig. 8). At the cellular level, we further showed that
these cardiovascular responses may result from activation of RVLM neurons and neuroinﬂammation because of activation of astrocytes and microglia in the RVLM (Fig. 8). We also showed that aliskiren, a novel renin
inhibitor, antagonizes stroke-induced pressor response by decreasing
Ang II and downregulating AT1R and AT2R, leading to an overall net

suppression of MCP-1/CCR2 signaling, elevated neuronal activation
and neuroinﬂammation (Fig. 8). Finally, we showed that combined application of aliskiren and Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV is more efﬁcacious in
preventing stroke-induced pressor response and tachycardia. Our results suggested that targeting on angiotensins (Ang II, Ang-(1–7) and
Ang IV) and the pro-inﬂammatory chemokine MCP-1 in the brain
stem rather than cerebral ischemic core or penumbra might be an alternative therapeutic strategy to reduce the pressor response after stroke.
Pharmacological manipulation of the RAS, targeting the penumbra
area, has been reported (Min et al., 2014) to improve the outcome of
stroke by amelioration of ischemic brain damage. On the other hand,
this is the ﬁrst time when participation of brain stem mechanisms in
stroke-induced elevation of BP and HR is revealed, engaging the welldocumented (Sandset et al., 2011; Chan et al., 2007, 2010) pressor and
tachycardiac effects of Ang II signaling in the RVLM, rather than in the
cerebral ischemic core or penumbra. Ang II-enhanced BBB permeability
and infarct volume are signiﬁcantly blunted in AT1aR−/− mice (Nagai
et al., 2011), and pretreatment with ARBs telmisartan (Kobayashi
et al., 2009) or candesartan (Saad et al., 2010) reduces cerebral infarct
volume and improves neurobehavioral dysfunction in rat models of
MCAO. However, the remedial efﬁcacy of systemic administration of
ARBs on stroke-induced pressor response is still controversial. We are
aware that BBB integrity could be compromised after stroke and one
would expect that, under the experimental conditions of the present
study, the peripherally acting ARB, valsartan, should have at least partial
access to the brain. Our observation that systemic administration of
valsartan was ineffective in preventing MCAO-induced transient increase in BP is commensurate with the ineffective therapeutic treatment of clinical ARBs to acute stroke-induced hypertension (Lattanzi
et al., 2013; Sykora et al., 2010). Considering that MCAO-treated animals
and stroked patients are both prone to damaged BBB, the possibility that
valsartan may exert a direct brain effect in our model is deemed minimal. Our results further indicated that stroke-induced pressor response
is executed by an upregulation of Ang II, AT1R and AT2R at mRNA and/
or protein level in the RVLM. It follows that ARBs targeted speciﬁcally
both AT1R and AT2R in the brain stem are more promising against
stroke-induced pressor response. Nevertheless, those ﬁndings are
seemingly at variance with the contemporary view (Luoh and Chan,
2001) that AT2R in the brain counteracts AT1R-mediated hypertension.
We noted, however, that Du et al. (2013) reported recently that application of the AT2R antagonist PD123319 into the RVLM increases BP only
in control rats but not during stress-induced hypertension. As such, it is
not unreasonable to stipulate that both AT1R and AT2R signaling in the
RVLM are involved in the pressor response after stroke. More importantly, the demonstration of a critical role for AT2R at the RVLM in
stroke-induced pressor response suggested that an alternative explanation for the controversial effect of contemporary ARBs is that these
agents are directed only against AT1R but not AT2R.
The physiological and pathological functions of Ang-(1–7)/MasR
and Ang IV/AT4R signaling have attracted recent attention (McKinley
et al., 2003). With reference to stroke, MasR activation by i.c.v. infusion
of Ang-(1–7) (Mecca et al., 2011) or AT4R activation by internal carotid
infusion of Ang IV (Faure et al., 2006) is protective against mortality,
neurological deﬁcit and cerebral infarct size after acute cerebral ischemia. Mechanistically, the present study revealed a reduction of Ang(1–7), MasR, Ang IV and AT4R level in the RVLM on day 1 after MCAO
that is concurrent with the activation of AT1R and AT2R signaling. It follows that the resultant decrease in the capacity to lower BP and HR in
effect exacerbates stroke-induced pressor response and tachycardia.
However, the inability of pretreatment with A779 and AT4R antiserum
to affect pressor response and tachycardia after stroke implies that
MasR or AT4R at the RVLM must be activated by Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV
to exert its depressive effects on BP and HR.
The present study also implicated an important role for inﬂammation at the RVLM in stroke-induced pressor response. The proinﬂammatory chemokine MCP-1 and its receptor CCR2 play an

Fig. 8. Schematic illustration of signaling pathways and cellular responses in RVLM that are
differentially involved in eliciting pressor response and tachycardia after stroke. Activation
of AT1R and AT2R by the augmented Ang II concentration in the RVLM after stroke promotes pressor response and tachycardia by upregulation of the MCP-1/CCR2 signaling
pathway. This process is exacerbated by the concurrent reduction in Ang-(1–7) and Ang
IV, both of which downregulate the MCP-1/CCR2 signaling pathway via MasR and AT4R
in the RVLM. At the cellular level, elevation of BP and HR may result from activation of
RVLM neurons and neuroinﬂammation because of activation of astrocytes and microglia
in the RVLM. Inhibition of renin in the RVLM by aliskiren reduces the concentration of primarily Ang II and secondarily Ang-(1–7) and Ang IV, with an overall net suppressive effect
on the MCP-1/CCR2 signaling. In addition, aliskiren may reduce activation of neurons, astrocytes and microglia in the RVLM. It follows that combined treatment with aliskiren and
Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV provides more effective amelioration of stroked-induced pressor response and tachycardia. ACE1, angiotensin converting enzyme 1; ACE2, angiotensin

important role in inﬂammatory responses following cerebral ischemia
(Tsukuda et al., 2011), and MCP-1/CCR2 signaling mediates macrophage
recruitment and neutrophil inﬁltration to the injury site, resulting in an
increase of infarct volume and brain damage (Schilling et al., 2009).
Thus, an intriguing ﬁnding of the present study is that in addition to
the infarct area, there is an increase in concentration of MCP-1, accompanied by inﬂammation in the brain stem RVLM that is responsible for
the pressor response after stroke. This notion is commensurate with a
newly emerged concept proposes that inﬂammatory responses underlie
Ang II-mediated hypertension (Pan et al., 2009). Our results demonstrated that augmentation of the pro-inﬂammatory mediator MCP-1
and subsequent activation of CCR2 in the RVLM underlie the pressor response induced by AT1R and AT2R signaling after stroke. Another intriguing ﬁnding in the present study is that the depressor effects of
Ang-(1–7)/MasR or Ang IV/AT4R in the RVLM after stroke, which antagonizes the pressor response induced after AT1R and AT2R activation, are
exerted by depressing the MCP-1/CCR2 signaling. Inhibition of proinﬂammatory cytokines in the cerebral cortex, accompanied by a reduction of the infarct area, is induced by Ang-(1–7) administration and
MasR activation (Regenhardt et al., 2013).
Our results suggest that aliskiren (a renin inhibitor) presents itself as a promising agent to reduce pressor response after stroke.
Renin is the ﬁrst and rate-limiting enzyme for the production primarily of Ang II, and secondarily of Ang-(1–7) and Ang IV
(Schroten et al., 2012). In aliskiren-treated animals, the serum levels
of Ang II and Ang-(1–7) are reduced (Rusai et al., 2011). We found
that, in addition to inhibiting renin, aliskiren affects a reduction of
pressor response after stroke via an anti-inﬂammatory action by
decreasing MCP-1 level and inhibiting the activation of neuron, microglia and astrocyte in the RVLM. Aliskiren depresses MCP-1 concentration in serum of hypertensive peritoneal dialysis patients

(Makówka et al., 2012) or in gentamicin-treated kidney and human
proximal tubular epithelial cell HK-2 lines (Bae et al., 2013; Singh
et al., 2013); and inhibits glial activation in white matter in a
mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (Dong et al., 2011).
O'Brien et al. (2007) reported that combination of lower doses
of aliskiren and MasR agonist AVE 0991, diuretics, angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor or ARB signiﬁcantly reduces experimental hypertension in deoxycorticosterone acetate-treated rats or
provides better end-organ protection in patients with mild-tomoderate hypertension. We also observed that combined treatment
with half doses of aliskiren and Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV produced significant antagonism of the stroke-induced increase in BP and HR to a
degree that was comparable to or more than that elicited by those
test agents when delivered alone at full dose, with an overall net suppressive effect on the MCP-1/CCR2 signaling. It follows that combined treatment with aliskiren and Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV provides
more effective amelioration of stroked-induced pressor response
and tachycardia.
Conclusions
Based on results obtained from a MCAO model of transient focal ischemic stroke, we concluded that AT1R- and AT2R-mediated activation
of MCP-1/CCR2 signaling induced by an elevated level of Ang II in the
RVLM, a critical brain stem neural substrate for the maintenance of
blood pressure, accompanied by concurrent reduction in Ang-(1–7),
MasR, Ang IV or AT4R expressions, account for the pressor response observed after stroke. We further showed that the novel renin inhibitor
aliskiren antagonizes the stroked-induced pressor response by reducing
Ang II, Ang-(1–7) and Ang IV levels, with an overall net suppression of
MCP-1/CCR2 signaling and an inhibition of neuroinﬂammation in the
RVLM. Finally, we showed that combined application of aliskiren and
Ang-(1–7) or Ang IV is more efﬁcacious in ameliorating strokeinduced pressor response and tachycardia.
Perspectives
For obvious reasons, timely and effective management of pressor response is beneﬁcial to patients presented to the intensive care unit
(ICU) after stroke. However, the remedial efﬁcacy of systemic administration of ARBs on stroke-induced pressor response is still controversial.
By providing further insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie pressor response and tachycardia after stroke, our
present ﬁndings offer several new directions for future therapeutic developments. We demonstrated that both AT1R and AT2R signaling in
the brain stem, particularly the RVLM, are engaged in the pressor response after stroke. This demonstration offers a reasonable explanation
for the controversy surrounding the efﬁcacy of currently available ARBs
that are based on peripheral AT1R antagonism. More importantly, it implicates that targeting both AT1R and AT2R may hold more promise
against stroke-induced pressor response. Our results also suggested
that therapy using aliskiren, alone or in combination with Ang-(1–7)
or Ang IV, offers a new remedial direction. Finally, anti-inﬂammation
by MCP-1 antagonism, particularly in conjunction with the two abovementioned directions, is another vista for the development of effective
therapeutic management against stroke-induced pressor response.
One primary requirement, however, for these strategies to be operative
is that the new therapeutic agents must cross the BBB if the ultimate target is the ATRs or MCP-1 in the RVLM.
