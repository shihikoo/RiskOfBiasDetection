Abstract
Bone fracture at the acute stage of stroke exacerbates stroke
injury by increasing neuroinﬂammation. We hypothesize that
activation of a-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a-7 nAchR)
attenuates neuroinﬂammation and oxidative stress, and
reduces brain injury in mice with bone fracture and stroke.
Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) was
performed in C57BL/6J mice followed by tibia fracture 1 day
later. Mice were treated with 0.8 mg/kg PHA 568487 (PHA, a7 nAchR-speciﬁc agonist), 6 mg/kg methyllycaconitine (a-7
nAchR antagonist), or saline 1 and 2 days after pMCAO.
Behavior was tested 3 days after pMCAO. Neuronal injury,
CD68+, M1 (pro-inﬂammatory) and M2 (anti-inﬂammatory)
microglia/macrophages, phosphorylated p65 component of
nuclear factor kappa b in microglia/macrophages, oxidative

and anti-oxidant gene expression were quantiﬁed. Compared
to saline-treated mice, PHA-treated mice performed better in
behavioral tests, had fewer apoptotic neurons (NeuN+TUNEL+), fewer CD68+ and M1 macrophages, and more M2
macrophages. PHA increased anti-oxidant gene expression
and decreased oxidative stress and phosphorylation of
nuclear factor kappa b p65. Methyllycaconitine had the
opposite effects. Our data indicate that a-7 nAchR agonist
treatment reduces neuroinﬂammation and oxidative stress,
which are associated with reduced brain injury in mice with
ischemic stroke plus tibia fracture.
Keywords: macrophage polarization, middle cerebral artery
occlusion, neuroinﬂammation, oxidative stress.

Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in the United
States (Go et al. 2013) and an important risk factor for bone
fracture (Kanis et al. 2001). About 70 000 people experience
a fracture within the ﬁrst year, and in the United States about
1–1.5% of fractures occur within the ﬁrst 24 h of stroke
(Kanis et al. 2001). We have shown that bone fracture 1 day
after ischemic stroke in mice exacerbates neuronal injury and
behavioral deﬁcits, which were associated with an increase in
microglia/macrophage inﬁltration in the peri-infarct region
(Degos et al. 2013).
Inﬂammation after stroke can be beneﬁcial. However,
excessive inﬂammation during the acute phase can incur
further damage (Hayakawa et al. 2010); conversely, reducing
the inﬂammation during the acute phase of ischemic stroke

decreases brain injury and improves functional outcome
(Hayakawa et al. 2010). In addition, microglia and macrophages mobilize to the injury site following stroke (Schroeter
et al. 1994), and can polarize into type I (pro-inﬂammation,
M1) and type II (anti-inﬂammation, M2) (Kigerl et al. 2009;
Durafourt et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2012). Reduction of M1 and

a-7 nAchR treatment reduces brain injury

increase of M2 macrophages may reduce neuronal injury and
improve functional recovery.
Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
brain injuries during ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (Klein
and Ackerman 2003; Paravicini and Sobey 2003) through
processes that involve nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (Wang et al. 2013). Upregulation of NADPH oxidase after brain injury triggers
neuroinﬂammation and increases pro-inﬂammatory factors
(Chen et al. 2011). NADPH oxidase is regulated by the
inﬂammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa b
(NF-jb) (Anrather et al. 2006).
While cigarette smoking is considered a risk factor for
ischemic stroke (Hawkins et al. 2002; Mazzone et al. 2010;
Fujii et al. 2013; Raval et al. 2013; Naik et al. 2014), some
animal studies have shown that nicotine has a beneﬁcial
effect on stroke recovery (Gonzalez et al. 2006; Yang et al.
2008). Alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (a-7 nAchR)
is ubiquitously expressed in the brain (Breese et al. 1997;
Quik et al. 2009; Woodruff et al. 2011). In a rat subarachnoid hemorrhage model (Duris et al. 2011) and in a mouse
intracerebral hemorrhage model (Krafft et al. 2012), activation of a-7 nAchR reduced brain injury. Potentiating a-7
nAchR using type-II positive allosteric modulator also
reduces brain injury and improves neurological function
after transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats (Sun et al.
2013). More importantly, a-7 nAchR expressed on the
surface of macrophages is a pivotal regulator of NF-jb
activity (Wang et al. 2003; Tracey 2009). Treatment of bone
marrow-derived macrophages with an a-7 nAchR-speciﬁc
agonist, PHA 568487 (PHA), prevented NF-jb activation in
the cells (Terrando et al. 2011). Terrando et al. (2011)
showed that PHA treatment reduces mouse cognitive decline
caused by aseptic bone fracture by promoting inﬂammation
resolution.

Previous studies attribute the neuroprotection of a-7
nAchR to its pro-survival effect (Duris et al. 2011; Krafft
et al. 2012). In this study, using mice with stroke and tibia
fracture, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of neuroinﬂammation and oxidative stress are also underlying
mechanisms of a-7 nAchR neuroprotection.

Methods
Animals
Animal experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California,
San Francisco, and conformed to National Institutes of Health
guidelines. Mice were fed standard rodent food and water ad
libitum, and were housed (ﬁve per cage) in sawdust-lined cages in
an air-conditioned environment with 12-h light/dark cycles.
C57BL/6J male mice (10–12 weeks old; Jackson Laboratory, Bar
Harbor, ME, USA) were randomly assigned to each treatment
group. Figure 1 shows the experimental design. Researchers,
blinded to the group assignment, performed neurobehavioral tests,
infarct volume assessment, and cell counting.
Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion procedure
Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane inhalation. A 1-cm skin
lesion from the left orbit to the ear was made, followed by a 2 mm2
craniotomy under aseptic surgical conditions. The middle cerebral
artery (MCA) was then permanently occluded (pMCAO) using
electrical coagulation just proximal to the pyriform branch (Degos
et al. 2013). The rectal temperature was maintained at 37  0.5°C
using a thermal blanket during surgery. A laser Doppler ﬂow-meter
(Vasamedics, Little Canada, MN, USA) was used to monitor the
surface cerebral blood ﬂow to ensure the success of MCA occlusion.
Mice with surface cerebral blood ﬂow in the ischemic core > 15% of
the baseline, or had massive bleeding because of the artery injuries,
were excluded from experiments. In this study, seven mice were
killed as a result of massive arterial bleeding during the pMCAO

performed 3 days (D3) after pMCAO. Tibial fracture was conducted
1 day (D1) after pMCAO. Drugs were injected i.p. 1 (ﬁrst injection) and
2 days (second injection) after pMCAO. Brain samples were collected
after the behavior tests 3 days after pMCAO.

procedure, and were replaced with additional mice housed in the
same cages. Two doses of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg of body
weight) were injected intraperitoneally at the beginning of the
surgery and 4 h after. Mice were allowed to recover spontaneously
under warm conditions.
Tibia fracture procedure
One day after the pMCAO procedure, animals were anesthetized with
2% isoﬂurane inhalation. Under aseptic surgical conditions, animals
received an open tibia fracture on the right hind limb with an
intramedullary ﬁxation, as previously described (Cibelli et al. 2010).
Animals were allowed to recover spontaneously from anesthesia
under warm conditions. Rectal temperature was maintained at
37  0.5°C using a thermal blanket throughout the surgical procedure. Two doses of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg of body weight) were
injected intraperitoneally at the beginning of the surgery and 4 h after.
The tibia fracture surgery did not cause any mortality.
Chemical reagents
PHA (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), a selective agonist of a-7
nAchR, and methyllycaconitine (MLA; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA),
an antagonist of a-7 nAchR, were diluted in 0.9% saline prior to use
and injected at the time indicated in Fig. 1. Using pMCAO mice, we
performed a dose–response study in which PHA (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg)
or MLA (4 and 6 mg/kg) were injected into the mice (i) once on day
1, or (ii) twice on days 1 and 2, after pMCAO. The testing doses were
selected based on previous studies (Duris et al. 2011; Terrando et al.
2011). We found that injection of PHA (0.8 mg/kg) and MLA
(6 mg/kg) on days 1 and 2 after pMCAO yielded the best effect on
infarct volume and behavior tests. Therefore, 0.8 mg/kg for PHA and
6 mg/kg for MLA were used in this study.
Behavioral tests
Adhesive removal test was performed to assess potential somatosensory neglect (Bouet et al. 2007). Brieﬂy, a piece of adhesive tape
(0.3 9 0.3 cm) was placed on one of the forepaws. The time it took
for the mouse to remove the tape was recorded. The maximum
testing time was 120 s. Mice were trained twice daily for 4 days
before pMCAO to obtain an optimal level of performance. The
adhesive removal times were recorded after two practice trials 1 day
before pMCAO (D-1), and 3 days after (D3). Since the infarct in our
model was on the left side of the brain, the adhesive removal times
from the right paw were more relevant and are thus reported here.
Corner test was performed to detect sensorimotor and postural
asymmetries after ischemic stroke (Zhang et al. 2002). Mice were
placed between two 30 9 20 cm boards. Both sides of their
vibrissae were stimulated as they approached the corner. The mice
would then move up and turn to face the open end. For normal mice,
the frequency of right and left turns was the same, whereas the
stroke mice turned more to the ipsilateral side of the lesion (to the
left in this study). Three different sets of 10 trials were conducted.
Turning not incorporated in a rearing movement was excluded.
Infarct volume estimation
Both triphenylterazolum chloride and cresyl violet staining are
routinely used to determine infarct volume (Tureyen et al. 2004).
We chose crysyl violet staining because the adjacent sections could
be used for other histological analyses, thus saving on animal usage

(the TTC method would have required using all brain tissues). Three
days after pMCAO, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde
and brain samples were then collected. A series of 20-lm-thick
coronal sections were made, of which 1 in 10 (200 lm apart) was
stained with cresyl violet, imaged, and digitalized using IMAGE J
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The infarct
areas were outlined and their pixel areas were quantiﬁed. The infarct
volumes were estimated by multiplying the sum of infarct areas
from all cresyl violet-stained sections by 200 lm.
Cytokine level quantification
Brain samples were collected after being perfused with saline to
prevent blood contamination. The cortex that contained the infarct
and peri-infarct regions, from bregma 1.7 mm to 2.1 mm (about
8 mm3), was harvested under a dissection microscope and placed in
RNAlaterTM solution (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RNA was then
extracted using Trizol Reagent (Qiagen), and reverse-transcribed
using High-Capacity RNA to cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix and
gene-speciﬁc primers and probes from Applied Biosystems,
including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
(Mm99999915_g1), CD11b (Mm00434455_m1), Inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS) (Mm00440502_m1), CD206 (Mm00485148_
m1), SOD1 (Mm01344233_g1), GPX1 (Mm00656767_g1),
gp91phox (Mm01287743_m1), and p22phox (Mm00514478_m1),
were used. Samples were run in triplicate. Speciﬁc gene expression
was normalized to GAPDH and calculated using the comparative
threshold cycle (DCT). Results were presented as fold-changes relative
to the mean value of saline-treated pMCAO + tibia fracture mice.
Histological analysis
Three sections (200 lm apart) from each brain (selected from the
same sets of serial sections used for infarct volume analysis) were
used for each immunostaining as indicated below. Sections were
incubated at 4°C overnight with the following primary antibodies:
CD68 (to detect active microglia/macrophages, 1 : 50; AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA), NeuN (to label neuron, 1 : 500; Millipore,
Bedford, MA, USA), Iba-1 (to label total microglia/macrophages,
1 : 200; Wako, Richmond, VA, USA), CD11b (to identify M1 cells,
1 : 200; AbD Serotec), CD206 (to identify M2 cells, 1 : 100; R&D,
Minneapolis, MN, USA), and NF-jb (to measure the activity of NFjb inﬂammatory pathway, 1 : 100; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA,
USA). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, sections were
then incubated with secondary antibodies: Alexa-594 or Alexa-488
IgG (1 : 500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Negative controls
were performed by omitting the primary or the secondary antibodies
during the staining procedure.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTPnick endlabeling (TUNEL) assay was performed using ApopTag (Millipore).
Positively stained cells were counted using Image J by three
researchers who were blinded to the research groups.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean  SD. Gaussian distribution was tested
with d’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. Equality of
variances was tested with the F-test. For comparisons of more than
two groups, means were compared using one-way ANOVA followed
by t-tests with a Bonferroni-corrected alpha level.

a-7 nAchR treatment reduces brain injury

Based on previous behavior data (Degos et al. 2013), we
estimated that a sample of nine mice per group was sufﬁcient to
demonstrate a decrease of 10 s to remove the adhesive in the right
paw (40 vs. 30 s with a SD of 6 s for each group), with 80% power
at the 0.016 alpha level (after adjusting for three comparisons) to
reach a signiﬁcant difference. Thus, we used 11 mice per group for
behavioral tests. The baseline behavior data presented in Fig. 2 are a
combination of data obtained from mice that were subjected to
pMCAO only and pMCAO + tibia. Brain samples were collected
after behavioral tests on day 3 after pMCAO; seven were used for
quantiﬁcation of infarct volume, apoptotic neurons, microglia/
macrophages (total, M1 and M2) on histological stained sections;
and four were used for analysis of cytokine using real-time RT-PCR.
A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant for 2group comparisons and the signiﬁcant threshold was adjusted for
multiple comparisons with a Bonferroni correction. Prism 6
(GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to conduct
the statistical analysis.

Results
a-7 nAchR agonist treatment reduced behavioral deficits
Mice subjected to pMCAO alone had impaired ability to
remove the adhesive from their right paw (p < 0.001; salinetreated groups in Fig. 2a) and made more left turns on day 3
after pMCAO compared to baseline (p < 0.001; salinetreated groups in Fig. 2b). Tibia fracture alone did not affect
the behavioral tests we used in the current study (Degos
et al. 2013). Mice with pMCAO + tibia fracture took longer
to remove the adhesive from the right paws (p < 0.001;
saline-treated groups in Fig. 2a), and made more left turns
(p = 0.013; Fig. 2b) than pMCAO mice on day 3 after
pMCAO. These data are consistent with our previous report
that tibia fracture 1 day after pMCAO exacerbates behavior
deﬁcit (Degos et al. 2013).
PHA treatment improved behavior performance in both
pMCAO and pMCAO + tibia fracture groups. Compared to
the saline group, PHA-treated pMCAO and pMCAO + tibia

fracture mice took less time to remove the adhesive from the
right paw (Fig. 2a), and made fewer left turns in the corner
test (Fig. 2b). However, pMCAO + tibia fracture mice still
took a longer time than pMCAO mice to remove adhesive
from their right paws after PHA treatment (p < 0.001), again
indicating that tibia fracture enhanced behavior dysfunction
of mice with ischemic stroke injury.
MLA treatment increased adhesive removal time (right
paw) in pMCAO and pMCAO + tibia mice (Fig. 2a), and
left turns in the corner test (Fig. 2b).
a-7 nAchR agonist treatment reduced infarct volume and
neuronal death
Tibia fracture, 1 day after pMCAO signiﬁcantly increased
the infarct volume (p = 0.005; saline-treated groups in
Fig. 3b) and TUNEL positive neurons in the peri-infarct
region (p = 0.015; saline-treated groups in Fig. 3e). These
data are consistent with our previous ﬁnding that tibia
fracture increases the neuronal damage of ischemic stroke
(Degos et al. 2013). PHA reduced infarct volume (Fig. 3a
and b) and TUNEL positive neurons in the peri-infarct
regions (Fig. 3c–e) of pMCAO and pMCAO + tibia fracture
mice. MLA increased infarct volume (Fig. 3a and b) and
TUNEL positive neurons (Fig. 3c–e).
a-7 nAchR agonist treatment decreased microglia/
macrophages
Compared to pMCAO mice, pMCAO + tibia fracture mice
had more CD68+ in the peri-infarct regions (p = 0.02; salinetreated groups in Fig. 4c), which indicated that tibia fracture
enhanced neruoinﬂammation during the acute stage of stroke.
PHA reduced the number of CD68+ cells in the peri-infarct
region of pMCAO (p < 0.001) and pMCAO + tibia fracture
(p = 0.017) mice (Fig. 4). However, pMCAO + tibia fracture mice still had more CD68+ cells than pMCAO after PHA
treatment (p = 0.03), suggesting that the neuroinﬂammation
in pMCAO + tibia fracture mice was more severe. MLA

(CD206 and IL-10) marker gene expression in the infarct and

M1 markers than pMCAO mice: iNOS and CD11b (salinetreated groups in Fig. 5a and b). Tibia fracture did not change
M2 marker, CD206, and IL-10 expression (Fig. 5c and d).

PHA reduced the expression of iNOS and CD11b (Fig. 5a
and b), and increased CD206 and IL-10 (Fig. 5c and d).
MLA increased the expression of iNOS and CD11b (Fig. 5a
and b), and had no effect on the expression of CD206 and IL10 (Fig. 5c and d). The expression of iNOS and CD11b was
still higher in the pMCAO + tibia group compared with
pMCAO-only group after PHA treatment, suggesting that
with the dose we used, PHA did not completely inhibit
inﬂammation induced by tibia fracture.
It is known that some of the M1 and M2 signature genes
are expressed not only in microglia/macrophages but also in
other cells in the brain. The results of real-time PCR,
therefore, reﬂect the changes of these genes in brain tissues
of mixed cell types. To evaluate whether the changes of gene
expression had any indication of microglia/macrophages
polarization after pMCAO or pMCAO + tibia fracture,
representative M1 (CD11b)-associated or M2 (CD206)associated marker proteins were analyzed using double
immunoﬂuorescent staining with the microglia/macrophage
marker Iba1 on the peri-infarct region (Fig. 6). Consistent
with the real-time PCR results, tibia fracture signiﬁcantly
increased M1 microglia/macrophages of pMCAO mice
(saline-treated group in Fig. 6b), but had no inﬂuence on
the number of M2 microglia/macrophages (saline-treated
group in Fig. 6d).
Compared to saline, PHA reduced M1 and MLA increased
M1 microglia/macrophages (Fig. 6a and b). PHA also
increased M2 cells (Fig. 6c and d), whereas MLA did not
change the number of M2 cells. The M1/M2 ratio decreased
after PHA treatment and increased after MLA treatment
(Fig. 6e).

Because it is difﬁcult to identify the infarct border on the
surface of the brain, we collected tissue from a slightly
larger area than that used in the histological analysis in
order to cover the variations of infarct size and location.
Since majority of CD68+ cells were located right outside
the infarct border (Fig. 4b) and few were detected in the
infarct region, and although the tissues in the infarct core
were included in the PCR analysis, we believed that both
PCR and histological analyses would measure the same
M1/M2 response.
a-7 nAchR agonist treatment increased anti-oxidant gene
expression and reduced NADPH oxidase and NF-jb
phosphorylation
To test whether a-7 nAchR agonist reduces oxidative stress,
we analyzed the expression of anti-oxidant genes, superoxide
dismutase 1 (SOD1), and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1),
and the expression of the two subunits of pro-oxidative stress
protein NADPH oxidase (gp91phox and p22phox), using
quantitative RT-PCR. NF-jb activity was analyzed by quantifying phospho-NF-jb p65 positive microglia/macrophages
in the peri-infarct region of pMCAO and pMCAO + tibia
fracture mice, using phospho-NF-jb p65 and Iba1 antibodystained sections. Tibia fracture reduced the expression of
SOD1 and GPX1, and increased the expression of gp91phox
and p22phox (Fig. 7a–d). PHA increased the expression of
SOD1 (Fig. 7a) and GPX1 (Fig. 7b), and decreased the
expression of gp91phox (Fig. 7c) and p22phox (Fig. 7d). MLA
decreased the expression of SOD1 (Fig. 7a) and GPX1
(Fig. 7b), and increased the expression of gp91phox (Fig. 7c)
and p22phox (p = 0.006, Fig. 7d).

pMCAO + tibial fracture mice had more phospho-NF-jb
p65 positive microglia/macrophages and phospho-NF-jb
p65 in the nuclei compared to pMCAO mice (Fig. 7f).
Phospho-NF-jb p65 positive microglia/macrophages and
phospho-NF-jb p65 in the nuclei decreased in the PHAtreated mice (Fig. 7e and f), and increased in the MLA group
(Fig. 7e and f). Thus, activation of a-7 nAchR reduced the
expression of NADPH oxidase and NF-jb activity, and
increased the expression of anti-oxidant genes.

Discussion
In this study, we examined the effects of PHA, the a-7
nAchR agonist, on neuroinﬂammation, and neuronal injury
in mice with contemporaneous ischemic stroke and bone
fracture. We found that administration of PHA 1 and 2 days
after pMCAO reduced neuronal injury and improved functional recovery. Interestingly, PHA increased anti-oxidant

gene expression and reduced microglia/macrophage inﬁltration, M1/M2 microglia/macrophage ratio, pro-oxidative
NADPH oxidase, and NF-jb activity (Table 1). These data
suggest that reduction of neuroinﬂammation and oxidative
stress might be one of the underlying mechanisms of a-7
nAchR neuroprotective effect.
We previously demonstrated that tibia fracture 1 day after
ischemic stroke exacerbates neuroinﬂammation and injury.
Blocking high-mobility-group box chromosomal protein-1
using an high-mobility-group box chromosomal protein-1
antibody or depletion of macrophage with clodrolip attenuated the effects of bone fracture on stroke recovery (Degos
et al. 2013). In this study, we found that tibia fracture
increased the ratio of M1/M2 microglia/macrophages,
NADPH oxidase and NF-jb activity, and reduced antioxidant gene expression. We also showed that the a-7
nAchR agonist, PHA, attenuates neuronal injury and behavioral dysfunction in mice with ischemic stroke only and
ischemic stroke plus tibia fracture.
In addition, we demonstrated that the nAchR antagonist,
MLA, had opposite effects to those of the agonist, PHA.
MLA-treated mice had signiﬁcantly more microglia/macrophages in the peri-infarct region, larger infarct size, more
apoptotic neurons, and poorer behavioral recovery compared
to either saline-treated controls or PHA-treated group. It has
been reported that MLA impairs normal mouse behavior
(Chilton et al. 2004). Our ﬁndings differ from the hemorrhagic stroke model in which MLA did not exacerbate
behavioral dysfunction or increase brain edema (Krafft et al.
2012). One of the reasons is that the neuroinﬂammation in
the hemorrhagic stroke model is more severe than in our
pMCAO model, and a greater dose of MLA may be needed
to precipitate its adverse effect.
Microglia/macrophages can be classiﬁed into two extreme
phenotypes: M1 or M2. M1 mediates host defense and is proinﬂammatory, while M2 plays anti-inﬂammatory roles
(Murray and Wynn 2011). Increased M1 microglia/macrophages could escalate tissue damage after stroke (Hu et al.
2012). We demonstrated that activation of a-7 nAchR by
PHA decreased the M1 and M2 microglia/macrophage ratio.
Because M2 macrophages play an anti-inﬂammatory role and
have been shown to promote axon regeneration in culture
(Kigerl et al. 2009), our ﬁnding suggests that the decreased
M1/M2 ratio contributed to reduced ischemic injury in our
model.
A previous study using a transient MCAO mouse model
showed that M2 macrophages at the early stage of stroke
were eventually replaced by M1 cells (Hu et al. 2012); the
macrophage outcome in our stroke and bone fracture model
is unknown. However, our results showed that tibia fracture
increased M1 in the peri-infarct region without affecting M2
microglia/macrophages, suggesting that bone fracture
increases neuroinﬂammation by promoting M1 macrophage
inﬁltration or polarization. This needs veriﬁcation through

We showed that PHA inhibits NF-jb phosphorylation,
consistent with our previous ﬁnding that PHA treatment
prevents TNFa (tumor necrosis factor alpha) induced NF-jb
activation in the hippocampi of tibia fracture mice (Terrando
et al. 2011). In a hemorrhagic stroke model, Krafft et al.
(2012) demonstrated that PHA confers neuroprotection by
reducing the expression of pro-apoptotic GSK-3ß (glycogen
synthase kinase 3 beta) and activation of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase)-Akt pathway. PI3K
Akt has also been shown to inhibit NF-jb signaling (Guha
and Mackman 2002). Therefore, decreased phospho-NF-jb
p65 after PHA in our model may act through the PI3K-Akt
pathway as well.

a-7 nAchR modulates vascular tones of cerebral arteries
(Si and Lee 2002), but because it is difﬁcult to monitor a-7
nAchR agonist/antagonist in awakened mice, we were not
able to measure its effect on cerebral blood ﬂow. Anesthesia
could inﬂuence hemodynamic measurement and additional
surgery procedure could cause additional inﬂammatory
response, which would have complicated our analysis.
In summary, using a mouse model of pMCAO and tibia
fracture, we showed that a-7 nAchR agonist treatment
decreases peri-infarct microglia/macrophage inﬁltration,
shifts microglia/macrophage polarization from M1 to M2,
and down-regulates NF-jb activity and oxidative gene
expression, which are associated with reduction in neuronal

injury and behavior deﬁcits. Our data indicate that in addition
to a previously recognized pro-survival effect, a-7 nAchR
agonist also acts through down-regulation of neuroinﬂammation and oxidative stress. Although our study could not
determine if PHA’s beneﬁcial effects are secondary to the
inhibition of stroke or bone-induced neuroinﬂammation, the
fact that PHA reduces the overall neuronal injury and
functional deﬁcits in treated mice indicate that activation of
a-7 nAchR could be a therapeutic opportunity for improving
the outcomes of patients with stroke and bone fracture.
