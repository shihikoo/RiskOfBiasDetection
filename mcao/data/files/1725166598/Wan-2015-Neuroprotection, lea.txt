Ethnopharmacological relevance: The Renshen Shouwu capsule (RSSW) is a patented Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM), that has been proven to improve memory and is widely used in China to apoplexy syndrome
and memory deﬁcits. To investigate the neuroprotective and therapeutic effect of the Renshen Shouwu
standardized extract (RSSW) on ischemic brain neuronal injury and impairment of learning and memory
related to Vascular Dementia (VD) induced by a focal and global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.
Material and methods: Using in vivo rat models of both focal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injuries induced by a
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and VD with transient global brain I/R neuronal injuries induced by a
four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) in Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats, RSSW (50,100, and 200 mg kg  1 body weights) and
Egb761s (80 mg kg  1) were administered orally for 20 days (preventively 6 daysþtherapeutically 14 days) in
4-VO rats, and for 7 days (3 days preventivelyþ4 days therapeutically) in MCAO rats. Learning and memory
behavioral performance was assayed using a Morris water maze test including a place navigation trial and a
spatial probe trial. Brain histochemical morphology and hippocampal neuron survival was quantiﬁed using
microscope assay of a pufﬁn brain/hippocampus slice with cresyl violet staining.
Results: MCAO ischemia/reperfusion caused infarct damage in rat brain tissue. 4-VO ischemia/reperfusion
caused a hippocampal neuronal lesion and learning and memory deﬁcits in rats. Administration of RSSW (50,
100, and 200 mg/kg) or EGb761 signiﬁcantly reduced the size of the insulted brain hemisphere lesion and
improved the neurological behavior of MCAO rats. In addition, RSSW markedly reduced an increase in the brain
infarct volume from an I/R-induced MCAO and reduced the cerebral water content in a dose-dependent way.
Administration of RSSW also increased the pyramidal neuronal density in the hippocampus of surviving rats
after transient global brain ischemia and improved the learning and memory ability of rats with 4-VO induced
vascular dementia in a dose-dependent manner.
Conclusions: The in vivo results suggested that RSSW has signiﬁcant neuroprotective effects against MCAO and
4-VO I/R injury and a therapeutic effect on cognitive disorders in VD rats. RSSW also improved the learning and
memory ability of VD rats. These results convincingly demonstrated that RSSW may be useful to prevent and
treat ischemia/reperfusion injury and vascular dementia disease.

Ischemic stroke accounts for 88% of all strokes and is associated
with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. Ischemic stroke
is characterized by rapidly developing clinical signs of a focal or
global disturbance in the cerebral function. These symptoms may
last from 24 h to weeks and can lead to death with no apparent
cause other than avascular origin (Silasi and Murphy, 2014).
Vascular dementia (VD) refers to a group of clinical syndromes of a
cognitive dysfunction resulting from brain tissue damage caused by

L. Wan et al. / Journal of Ethnopharmacology 165 (2015) 118–126

ischemic, hemorrhagic and acute and chronic hypoxic ischemic
cerebrovascular disease. Vascular cognitive impairment is deﬁned by
alterations in cognition, ranging from subtle deﬁcits to full-blown
dementia, which are attributed to cerebrovascular causes. Often
coexisting with Alzheimer's disease, mixed vascular and neurodegenerative dementia has emerged as the leading cause of age-related
cognitive impairment (Savva et al., 2009; Costantino, 2013).
Patients with vascular dementia (VD) in Asian accounted for
approximately half of all patients with dementia because of the higher
incidence of stroke. In recent years, the morbidity and mortality of VD
has been increasing yearly and has become the third most fatal disease
in the world after heart disease and cancer (Myron and Ginsberg,
2008; Ginsberg, 2009). Because it leads to serious damage and there is
no effective drug for its treatment, VD destroys the quality of life of the
elderly and becomes a heavily burdensome to society and the family. It
is our urgent hope to develop a new effective agent to prevent and
treat VD (Barone, 2009).
Chinese medicine has a long history of preventing and treating
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases as well as other related
brain diseases. These medicines have obvious curative effects and are
deemed to be safe due to low toxicity and few side effects (Huang,
2009). The Renshen Shouwu (RSSW) capsule is a potent, patented, and
Chinese Pharmacopoeia-approved Traditional Chinese Medicine
(TCM). RSSW is composed of Renshen (Root of Ginseng-Panax ginseng
C.A. Mey) and ﬂeece-ﬂower root (Radix Polygoni Multiﬂori -Polygonum multiﬂorum Thunb) and has the ability to strengthen the brain,
pacify the nerves, tone the liver and kidney, and replenish qi and the
blood. RSSW is recommended for Qi and blood deﬁciency, whitening
beard and hair at early ages, neurasthenia, forgetfulness, insomnia, loss
of appetite, fatigue and other symptoms. RSSW is also widely used to
treat several diseases, including the following: diseases of cerebrovascular nervous system, amnesia, insomnia, and mental decline (Pharmacopoeia Committee of the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic
of China, 2010).
Studies have shown that the RSSW compound ginsenoside Rb1 (an
active component of Renshen, 10–40 mg/kg intravenously i.v. 30 min
before MCAO or a single dose of intranasal) protected the brain from
ischemic and reperfusion injuries by decreasing infarct size, and
neurologic deﬁcit. However, its bioavailability is low after oral administration due to poor absorption (Zhang et al., 1996; Lu et al., 2011).
Despite its wide clinical uses, the neuroprotective effects of oral
administration of RSSW on cerebral ischemia injury and its improvement of learning and memory impairment have not yet been reported.
In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effects of oral
administration of RSSW on a focal I/R injury induced by a middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), on a transient global brain I/R injury
induced by a modiﬁed Pulsinelli four-vessel occlusion (4-VO), and on
learning and memory improvement in Sprague–Dawley rats.

119

kilogram of Hongshen (Processed Radix Gingshen)and 1.5 kg of
Zhiheshouwu (Polygoni Multiﬂori Radix Praeparta) were grinded into
powders (ﬁltered through a 2 mm-steel sieve), and reﬂuxed in 10 L of
a hydroethanolic solution (30% v/v), at 85 1C for 2 h two times. The
30% ethanol extract solution was ﬁltered through a Whatman paper
ﬁlter no. 12, and was evaporated under reduced pressure (Buchi R-114,
Switzerland). Finally the extract was dried under vacuum below 60 1C.
In total, 502.5 g of RSSW was retrieved.

2.3. HPLC ﬁngerprint of RSSW
The analyses were performed using Waters high performance
liquid chromatograph Alliance e 2695 equipment (Singapore) coupled
with a photodiodearray detector (PDA) 2998 (and 2424 ELS Detector),
controlled by LC-Solution Multi-PDA software. Chromatographic
separation of the analytes was achieved on a Ultimate-XBC18 column
(Phenomenex, 250 mm  4.6 mm; 5 μm particle size) using acetonitrile (A) – deionized and HPLC grade water (B) as a mobile phase in a
gradient elution program using the following method: 0–20.0 min, B
19%; 20.0–40.0 min, B 19–26%; 40.0–60.0 min, B 26–38%; and 60–
65 min, B 38%. The ﬂow rate was set to 0.8 ml/min and 10 μL of
sample was injected. A C18 guard column (Phenomenex Technologies)
was used to prevent column degradation.
Calibration curves were prepared by plotting the peak area ratios of
the various concentrations of analytes followed by linear regression.
A correlation coefﬁcient (r) of r2 Z0.99 was considered to be acceptable. Linearity was determined using the correlation coefﬁcients from
the calibration curves using nine concentrations of each analytes.
Separately, ginsenoside and stilbene glucoside (SBG) standard curves
were preparedby dissolving accurately weighed samples in methanol
to obtain concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 500 μg/mL. RSSW
samples were prepared in the same way to adjust the ginsenoside
and stilbene glucoside (SBG) concentration within the linearity range.
The total ginsenoside Rb1, Rg1, Re, and Rd contents were expressed as
the sum of the peak areas, which were previously identiﬁed as the
main ginsenoside found in RSSW. Each result represented the mean
value of three determinations.
The ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Re, ginsenoside
Rd, and 2,3,5,4-tetrahydroxy-stillbene-a-O-3-D-glucoside (stilbene glucoside, SBG, purity 498.0%) were purchased from the Chinese
National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological
Products (Beijing, China).
HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol were obtained from Merck
KGaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Deionized and HPLC grade water were
prepared using a Millipore water puriﬁcation system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Formic acid was HPLC grade and all other reagents
were analytical grade.

(RSSW) was prepared according to the Renshen Shouwu Capsule
from thePharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China, 2010, Vol. 1
(for Traditional Chinese Medicine) with the following protocol. One

Adult male healthy Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats (weighing 180–200 g)
were obtained from the Guangdong Medicinal Laboratory Animal
Center, Guangzhou, China. All animals were maintained according to
the Chinese government guidelines for care and use of laboratory
animals with a controlled environment at room temperature (RT) of
2571.0 1C, with relative humidity of 40–60%, an automatic day–night
rhythm (12 h cycle) and 10–15 air changes per hour. The rats had free
access to standard lab chow and ﬁltered tap water. Procedures
involving animals and their care were approved by the Institutional
Animal Ethics Committee of Guangdong Pharmaceutical (GDPUIAEC
no. 20130513) which is in a compliance with NIH Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication no. 85-23, 1985). All of
the surgical procedures were conducted using aseptic and anesthetic
techniques in special purpose operating suites.

2.5. Neuroprotective effect of RSSW on MCAO rats
2.5.1. Surgery
After 3 days of RSSW and EGb761s or vehicle administration, a
stroke was produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
performed with a ﬁlament occlusion model as previously
described (Bederson et al., 1986; Longa et al., 1989; Bei et al.,
2009). Brieﬂy, rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate
(3 ml/kg, i.p.), and the right common carotid artery (CCA), internal
carotid artery (IC), external carotid artery (EC), and proximal
branches of the EC were carefully dissected under a microscope.
The EC at the most proximal portion and the proximal CCA were
permanently ligated. Then the IC was temporarily clipped with a
vascular clip just distal to its bifurcation. To induce focal cerebral
ischemia, the ﬁlament was covered with silicon rubber with a
round tip (0.3 mm in diameter), was inserted 19–21 mm distal
from the bifurcation of the IC to block the origin of MCA, and ﬁxed
to prevent spontaneous withdrawing. After 2 h of occlusion, the
ﬁlament was removed through the same skin incision under reanesthesia to allow reperfusion. In the group of sham-operated
rats, all of the surgical procedures, except MCAO, were performed.
The rats were then returned to their cages and had free access to
food and water.
The neurological behavior of the rats that survived were evaluated
12, 24, 48, and 72 h after reperfusion as previously described
(Bederson et al., 1986; Longa et al., 1989; Bei et al., 2007). A ﬁve level
score standard was used as follows: 0, normal, no symptoms of
neurological lesion; 1, unable to fully stretch the front paw controlled
by the ischemic cerebral hemisphere; 2, move around along the front
paw controlled by the ischemic cerebral hemisphere; 3, upside down
along the front paw controlled by the ischemic cerebral hemisphere;
and 4, unable to move spontaneously.
2.5.2. Drug administration in MCAO and sham operated rats
RSSW extracts (batch no. 20130928) and the positive control
drug Ginaton (Extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves tablets, EGb761
[purchased from Ipsen France and Dr Willmar Schwabe production, batch no.: 0780310] were prepared with 1% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) into a suspension gavage.
A total of 50 MCAO rats were randomized into ﬁve different
treatment groups (n ¼ 10 each group) as follows: vehicle, RSSW
(50, 100, or 200 mg/kg), and EGb761s 80 mg/kg). Another 10
sham-operated rats were grouped into the sham control group.
Rats were treated with the vehicle (CMC-Na), RSSW (50, 100, or
200 mg/kg) orally for 3 days pre-MCAO and 4 days post-MCAO. In
addition, the sham-operated group was treated with the vehicle.
EGb761-treated rats were given 80 mg/kg based on previous studies
(Bei et al., 2007).
2.5.3. Evaluation of cerebral ischemic damage in rats
To verify the neuroprotective effects of RSSW, rats were deeply
anesthetized and decapitated 4 days after reperfusion. Brains were
rapidly dissected, frozen and stored at  20 1C to evaluate the
infarct volume and histology.
The decapitated brains were cooled on ice for 30 min and then
coronally sectioned in 2 mm thick segment from 2 mm caudal to the
frontal tip with a tissue slicer. The slices were immediately stained
with 2% 2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Sigma) at room
temperature (25 1C) for 30 min in the dark and ﬁxed by immersion in
4% (w/w) para-formaldehydes in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). The sections obtained were scanned with a high resolution
CCD camera (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The total infarct areas of the
sections were quantiﬁed with a CD-8000 Image Analysis System
(Britain, UK). The total mean infarct areas of each section was
calculated as the average of the area on its rostral and caudal surface.

The determined infarct area of all sections were added and multiplied
by the section thickness (2 mm) to calculate the infarct volume,
expressed in mm3 and recalculated to yield the percentage volume
of the contralateral hemisphere.
The remnant brain tissues were incubated in the same ﬁxative
solution for 2 h and placed in a 30% sucrose solution of PBS
overnight. Frozen coronal sections were cut on a cryostat before
the sections (14 mm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(HE) and examined under an Axio Observer A1 photomicroscope
(Carl Zeiss, Germany). Attention should be especially paid to
edema, inﬂammation, inﬁltration and necrosis in the brain tissues.
To evaluate the effect of RSSW on cerebral ischemia edema, the
remnant brain was accurately weighed for the wet weight, and
then dried for 24 h in a 160 1C heat incubator to assay the water
content of the rat brain. The content of the rat brain water content
(%) is equal to (wet weight dry weight)/wet weightn100%.
To evaluate the effect of RSSW on cerebral ischemia, we
compared the rats treated with RSSW to controls treated with
vehicle by the same route (Bei et al., 2009).
2.6. Neuroprotective effect of RSSW on learning and memory in 4-VO
rats
2.6.1. Four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) induced transient global cerebral
ischemia preparation in rats
Transient cerebral ischemia was induced by 4-VO, as has been
described previously (Pulisinelli et al., 1979; Bei et al., 2009).
Brieﬂy, under anesthesia with chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, i. p.),
vertebral arteries were electrocauterized and common carotid
arteries were exposed. On the following day, both carotid arteries
were occluded with aneurysm clips to induce cerebral ischemia.
After 15 min of occlusion, the aneurysm clips were removed for
reperfusion. The rectal temperature was maintained at approximately 37 1C throughout the procedure. Rats who lost their righting reﬂex and whose pupils were dilated and unresponsive to light
were selected for the experiments. Rats who had seizures were
discarded.
Electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to conﬁrm the isoelectricity
after carotid artery occlusion. Sham controls were performed using the
same surgical procedures, except that the carotid arteries were not
occluded.
A total of 50 4-VO models rats were randomly divided into ﬁve
groups (n¼10 per group) including a 4-VOþ Vehicle group; three
groups that received three different doses of 4-VOþ RSSW; and a
4-VOþEGb761s group. Another 10 sham-operated rats were in the
sham group.
RSSW was administered at 50, 100, or 200 mg (10 ml)/kg/day
orally for 6 days before the 4-VO and 14 days after the 4-VO. The
same times and routes of administration of 1% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC-Na) solution were used for the shamoperated and 4-VO ischemia vehicle control rats. EGb761-treated
rats were given 80 mg/kg based on previous studies (Bei et al.,
2007). All drug solutions were freshly prepared before use as
described in Section 2.5.1.
2.6.2. Morris water maze
The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to evaluate the
improvement of RSSW on the learning and memory deﬁcit of 4-VO
treated rats. The apparatus consisted of a circular pool (35 cm in
height and 100 cm in diameter) ﬁlled with 2671 1C water. A clear
Plexiglas platform (10 cm high  8-cm diameter) was submerged 1 cm
below the water. The pool was divided into four equal quadrants and
each quadrant was marked by a different visual cue. The platform was
randomly placed in one of the quadrants for the duration of the
experiment. The test included the acquisition trial and probe trial.

L. Wan et al. / Journal of Ethnopharmacology 165 (2015) 118–126

To test the learning ability of the rats, the acquisition trial was
conducted on the 8th day after the 4-VO operation. On the ﬁrst
day, rats were allowed a 120-s habituation session in the pool
without the platform. The following 4 days, each rat received four
120-s learning trials with the invisible platform, with 30 min
resting periods between trials. For each learning trial, rats were
placed in the water facing the pool wall at one of four points of
entry. The escape latency, which is the time required to locate the
submerged platform, was recorded for each trial. If the rat was
unable to locate the platform within 120 s, it was led to the
platform and allowed to rest for 30 s. The escape latency in these
cases was recorded as 120 s.
After the completion of the acquisition trials, the platform was
removed from the pool. Each rat was then subjected to a 120-s
memory retention test. In this test, the distance and the time the
rat spent swimming in the same quadrant as the platform had
previously been hidden was recorded. The distance and the time
the rat spent swimming in the same quadrant was described as
the spatial memory.

2.6.3. Histochemical analysis
Rats were perfusion ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde in a 0.1 M
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) under anesthesia at the end of

121

the experiments after 20 days of reperfusion. The brains were
quickly removed and placed in the same ﬁxative solution for 4 1C
overnight. Post-ﬁxed brains were embedded in parafﬁn, followed
by the preparation of the coronal sections, which were 6 μm thick,
using a microtome (Leica RM2135, Nussloch, Germany). The
parafﬁn-embedded brain sections were deparafﬁnized with xylene
and rehydrated with ethanol at graded concentrations of 100–70%
(v/v), followed by washing with water. The sections were stained
with Nissl staining kit (GeneCopoeic, Inc. USA) according to the
manufacturer's protocol and examined using light microscopy
(Axio Observer A1 photomicroscope [Carl Zeiss, Germany]). The
number of surviving hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (Nissl's
body positive cell) per 1-mm length were counted as the neuronal
density.

2.7. Statistical analyses
All data were expressed as the mean7SD, were obtained from no
less than 10 independent rats and were evaluated for statistical
signiﬁcance using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with SPSS
11.5, followed by Duncan's new multiple range test or the Newman–
Keuls test where appropriate. Po0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. HPLC ﬁngerprint and identiﬁcation of major peaks for RSSW
by HPLC
There were more than ﬁve major peaks in the HPLC ﬁngerprint
chromatogram of RSSW. The ginsenoside Rb1, ginsenoside Rg1,
ginsenoside Re, ginsenoside Rd, and 2,3,5,4-tetrahydroxy-stillbene-a-O-3-D-glucoside (stilbene glucoside, SBG) in RSSW were
identiﬁed by HPLC assays according to their m/z and retention
time compared with authentic compound (Fig. 1). The RSSW
contained more than 16.7 mg/g of total ginsenoside (including
8.52 mg/g ginsenoside Rb1, 1.92 mg/g ginsenoside Rd, 3.33 mg/g
ginsenoside Re and 2.9 mg/g ginsenoside Rg1) and 27.1 mg/g of
stilbene glucoside (SBG), as was characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
3.2. Neuroprotective effect of RSSW on MCAO I/R-induced cerebral
damage
3.2.1. Effect of RSSW on the neurological behavior score of MCAO I/R
rats
A severe motor incoordination and an increase in the neurological
behavior score, were noted after 12–72 h of reperfusion in the MCAO
rats (Fig. 2). The administration of RSSW (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day
for 7 days (3 days before ischemia and 4 days after ischemia)
markedly attenuated the increase in neurological behavior score
and improved I/R-induced motor incoordination observed 12–72 h
after the ischemia in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2).
3.2.2. Effect of RSSW on the brain infarct volume of MCAO I/R rats
The hemisphere volume was shown to be 32.7% of the cerebral
infarct volume after 2 h of transient focal cerebral ischemia followed
by reperfusion in the MCAO rats measured by TTC staining (Fig. 3).
The administration of RSSW (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day for 7 days
(3 days before ischemia and 4 days after ischemia) markedly reduced
the MCAO I/R-induced cerebral infarct volume by 42.2%, 53.8% and
63.9% respectively (Po0.01, Fig. 3, Table 3S) in a dose-dependent
manner.
Administration of EGb761 (80 mg/kg/day) similarly reduced the
infarct volume by 65.4% (Po0.01) (Fig. 3). This ﬁnding suggested that
the administration of RSSW inhibited I/R injury and improved the
neurological behavior of the I/R rats compared with thecontrol group.
The samples for HE-staining were prepared from the sections
adjacent to those for the TTC staining. The HE-staining showed that
the MCAO caused the following progressive histological damage in
rat brains: disappearance of the integrity of the hippocampus,
cerebral cortex, and striatum. Marked vacuolation, edema, severe

degeneration, inﬁltration with inﬂammatory lymphocytes and histological necrosis were also seen in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex,
and striatum of the ischemic rat brains. The administration of 50, 100,
or 200 mg/kg RSSW improved histology in the ischemic rat brains
with less marked vacuolation, less severe degeneration and less
inﬁltration of lymphocytes (Figs. 4 and 5).
3.3. Effect of RSSW on the brain water content of MCAO I/R rats
The brain tissue water content of the insulted hemisphere was
shown to have clearly increased by 4.49% after 2 h of transient
focal cerebral ischemia followed by a 72 h reperfusion in the
MCAO rats (Fig. 6).
The administration of RSSW (50, 100, or 200) mg/kg/day for
7 days (3 days before ischemia and 4 days after ischemia) markedly
reduced the MCAO I/R-induced cerebral water content by 44.0%,
58.1% and 65.4% respectively, in a dose-dependent way (Fig. 6).
Administration of EGb761 (80 mg/kg/day) showed a similarly effect.
3.4. Effects of RSSW on the Moris water maze test in rats with 4-VO
The Morris water maze test showed that 4-VO treatment signiﬁcantly prolonged the escape latency of the rats compared with the
sham operation group. RSSW (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) clearly reversed
the prolonged escape latency of the rats with 4-VO treatment in a
dose-dependent way (Fig. 7).
The data also indicated that rats treated with 4-VO exhibited a
shortened the exploratory swimming distance in the platform
quadrant (i.e. target quadrant) and less frequency crossing (learning
ability) in the target quadrant compared with the sham operation
group (Figs. 8 and 9). RSSW (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly
prolonged the shortened swimming distance in the platform quadrant and increased the frequency of the rats crossing the target
quadrant with 4-VO treatment in a dose-dependent way, which

Fig. 3. Effects of RSSW on infarct volumes in rats subjected to 2 h of MCAO
followed by 96 h of reperfusion. The experiment was conducted as described in

showed that RSSW and EGb761s improved the spatial memory
ability of the rats with 4 VO cerebral ischemia (Figs. 8 and 9).
3.5. Effects of RSSW against 4-VO I/R injury
Most hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell neurons in the 4-VO rats
were shown to be damaged compared with sham rats (Fig. 10).
The rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell nuclei in the sham
operation group were large and round, with an obvious nucleolus,
visible light stained neurites, and pyramidal neuronal cells were
arranged closely and neatly, with 6–7 per layer. The neuronal
density was 172.17 17.4 (Fig. 10A). In the cerebral ischemia model
group (Fig. 10B), pyramidal neuronal cell in the hippocampal CA1
were sparse, with only 4–5 per layer. The pyramidal neuronal body

became smaller with blurry cellular superﬁcies and karyopyknosis.
The hippocampal CA1 neuronal density in 4-VO rats was only
87.1 721.5/mm, which was extremely reduced compared with the
sham operation group. Administration of RSSW (50, 100, or
200 mg/kg) dramatically and dose-dependently increased the
survival hippocampal CA1 neurons arranged closely and neatly
in visible 5–6 layers in the rats with 4-VO ischemia by 309.2%,
620.8% and 658.5% respectively, in a dose-dependent way
(P o0.01, Figs. 10 and 11). This ﬁnding showed that RSSW can
prevent hippocampal CA1 neurons from ischemia reperfusion
damage.
Administration of Ginaton (EGb761s, 80 mg/kg/day) similarly
protected hippocampal CA1 neuron in 4-VO rats (Figs. 10 and 11),

decline (Pharmacopoeia Committee of the Ministry of Health of the
People's Republic of China, 2010). This is the ﬁrst study to show that
oral administration of RSSW (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg, i. g.) markedly
protected MCAO and 4-VO rats from cerebral I/R injury, and improved
the ability of learning and memory of 4-VO induced vascular dementia
rats. Our study has provided direct a scientiﬁc experimental data to
support the clinical efﬁcacy of RSSW in the treatment of memory
deﬁciency and sequelae of apoplexy.
In the present study, a series of experiments were designed to
investigate the neuroprotective effects and cognitive improvement
of RSSW in cerebral ischemic rats in vivo. The dosage of RSSW
(50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day) is in the clinical dosage range to treat
neural diseases (Pharmacopoeia Committee of the Ministry of
Health of the People's Republic of China, 2010).
Here, for the ﬁrst time, we have shown that the administration of
RSSW at 50, 100, or 220 mg/kg/day orally for 7 days (3 days before
MCAO and 4 days after MCAO) signiﬁcantly reduced the lesion in the
insulted brain hemisphere, reduced the infarct volume and reduced
the brain water content of the rats with a MCAO ischemia/reperfusion injury, and improved the neurological behavior of MCAO rats.
The administration of RSSW at 50, 100, or 220 mg/kg/day orally for
20 days (6 days before 4-VO and 14 days after the ischemia) was also
shown to provide signiﬁcant protection against a neuronal injury by
increasing the number of surviving neurons in the hippocampus of
the rats following a transient global brain ischemia/reperfusion.
The study showed that there were no signiﬁcant differences in
the body weight change and the swimming ability of cerebral
ischemia rats among the different experimental rat groups of the
experimental rats. As shown in Fig. 7, along with constant swimming
training, from the third days to the ﬁfth days, the latency of rats in
the vehiclel group was signiﬁcantly longer than in the sham operation group, which showed that cerebral ischemia decreased the
ability of learning and memory. The latency in the 4-VO cerebral
ischemia rats administered with a low, middle, or high dose of RSSW
and EGb761s wase shorter than in the rats treated with vehicle, and
RSSW showed a signiﬁcantly improvement on learning and memory
impairment in a dose-dependent way.
Ginkgo biloba extract is a scientiﬁcally proven natural product
that is widely used to treat cerebral ischemic disorder and neurological disorders (Chandrasekaran et al., 2003; Diamond and Bailey,
2013; Tan et al., 2014). We used a Ginkgo extract (EGb761) as a
reference to examine the neuroprotective ability of RSSW in rats with
a 4-VO and MCAO I/R injury. In these experiments, EGb761 demonstrated a similar neuroprotective efﬁcacy with RSSW. The 4-VO
ischemic rat model is commonly used as a vascular dementia model
(Pulsinelli et al., 1982). Chronic cerebral ischemia might cause brain
white matter lesions and cognitive impairment (Ginsberg, 2009;
Pantoni and Gorelick, 2011; Shih et al., 2013; Costantino, 2013).

Antioxidation, neurotrophic, and neurovascular protection from
infarct lesions might have therapeutic effects on the impaired cerebral
tissue and improve cognitive disorder, vascular cognitive impairment
and vascular dementia (Yassi et al., 2002; Cramer, 2008;Myron and
Ginsberg, 2008; Middleton and Yaffe, 2009; Zhang and Chopp, 2009;
Zlokovic, 2011).
Our study showed that oral administration of RSSW (50, 100, or
200 mg/kg/day) decreased the prolonged escape latency, and increased
the shortened exploring swimming distance and the frequency swimming crossed the target quadrant of 4-VO rats in the Morris Water
Maze test. RSSW was demonstrated to improve the learning and
memory ability of the vascular dementia rats. This ﬁnding is consistent
with the indication recommended by Chinese Pharmacopoeia for
clinical therapeutic uses in amnesia, insomnia, neurasthenia and
mental decline. Our study has provided direct scientiﬁc experimental

evidence for the efﬁcacy of RSSW in clinically treating vascular
dementia.
RSSW is composed of Ginseng (Root of Ginseng-Panax ginseng C.A.
Mey) and ﬂeece-ﬂower root (Radix Polygoni Multiﬂori -Polygonum
multiﬂorum Thunb). Ginsenoside Rb1, Rd, Re, Rg1 and stilbene glucoside (SBG) were discovered to be the main constituents of RSSW by
HPLC analysis (Fig. 1). Combined with other ginsenosides, these
compounds demonstrated signiﬁcantly contributed to neuroprotection
and memory improvement (Zhang and Liu, 1996; Zhou et al., 2010; Ye
et al., 2011). Stilbene glucoside (SBG), chemical name 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxyl diphenylethylene-2-o-glucoside, has been described as the
active ingredient in ﬂeece-ﬂower root, a common TCM herb (Liu
et al., 2006).
These ginsenosides and SBG has been reported to be effective at
protecting IR injury and improving the learning and memory ability in
normal mouse and 4-VO rats and mice (Zhang and Liu, 1996; Liu et al.,
2006; Zhao et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2010; Ye et al., 2011). Ginsenoside
Rg1 has anti-aging and neurotropic effects (Zhang and Liu, 1996; Liu,
1996). 2, 3, 5, 4-tetrahydroxy stilbene-2-O-D-glucoside (SBG) improved
the surviving hippocampal neurons and the ability of learning and
memory, and reduced the water content, the inﬂammatory reaction,
and the free radicals in the brain in ischemia dementia mice induced
by chronic cerebral ischemia (Liu et al., 2006; Chu et al., 2004). These
effects might contribute to the protection of RSSW on a MCAO or 4-VO
ischemic injury and the improvements on learning and memory
ability in vivo.
Central to the disease mechanism is the crucial role that cerebral
blood vessels play in brain health, not only for the delivery of oxygen
and nutrients but also for trophic signaling that inextricably links the
well-being of neurons and glia to that of cerebrovascular cells
(Costantino, 2013).
However, the molecular mechanisms of how RSSW protects
neurons against ischemia reperfusion and improves the learning
and memory ability of 4-VO rats remain to be fully elucidated. SBG
has been known to improve the ability of learning and memory, to
lower total cholesterol, and to act as an antioxidant. By alleviating

126

oxidative damage in neuron cells, it is suggested that RSSW might
not only delay the neurodegenerative process, but also help the
recovery of neuronal function. Protecting the neurons from oxidative stress injury induced by glutamate or hypoxia-reoxygen might
be one of the important mechanisms of RSSW
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that RSSW could protect the
cerebral tissues from I/R injury, reduce infarct volume, reduce brain
water content and edema, improve the neurological behavior of the
rats with MCAO-induced cerebral damage, and signiﬁcantly protect
the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons from 4-VO transient global
brain ischemia and reperfusion damage in rats. Moreover, RSSW
improved the learning and memory ability of the vascular dementia
rats. These ﬁndings suggest that our study has provided direct
scientiﬁc experimental evidence for the efﬁcacy of RSSW in clinically
treating vascular dementia, which is directly related in TCM Qi blood
deﬁciency, neurasthenia, and forgetfulness.
