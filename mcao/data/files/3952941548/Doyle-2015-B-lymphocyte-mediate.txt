Each year, 10 million people worldwide survive the neurologic injury associated with a stroke. Importantly, stroke survivors have more
than twice the risk of subsequently developing dementia compared with people who have never had a stroke. The link between stroke and
the later development of dementia is not understood. There are reports of oligoclonal bands in the CSF of stroke patients, suggesting that
in some people a B-lymphocyte response to stroke may occur in the CNS. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a B-lymphocyte
response to stroke could contribute to the onset of dementia. We discovered that, in mouse models, activated B-lymphocytes infiltrate
infarcted tissue in the weeks after stroke. B-lymphocytes undergo isotype switching, and IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies are found in the
neuropil adjacent to the lesion. Concurrently, mice develop delayed deficits in LTP and cognition. Genetic deficiency, and the pharmacologic ablation of B-lymphocytes using an anti-CD20 antibody, prevents the appearance of delayed cognitive deficits. Furthermore,
immunostaining of human postmortem tissue revealed that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke also occurs in the brain of some people
with stroke and dementia. These data suggest that some stroke patients may develop a B-lymphocyte response to stroke that contributes
to dementia, and is potentially treatable with FDA-approved drugs that target B cells.

Introduction
The 7 million Americans currently living with the aftereffects of
stroke are at increased risk of developing dementia, and approximately one-third will eventually suffer from vascular dementia
(Barba et al., 2000; Leys et al., 2005; Béjot et al., 2011). In many of
these patients, dementia might be caused by an associated comorbidity, but even after controlling for dementia risk factors, such as
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and age, the ocReceived Oct. 2, 2014; revised Dec. 8, 2014; accepted Dec. 18, 2014.

currence of a single stroke increases the risk of developing new
dementia by at least twofold (Leys et al., 2005; Savva and Stephan,
2010). The mechanism(s) behind this increased dementia risk are
unknown.
We focused here on the hypothesis that stroke can elicit a chronic,
injurious B-lymphocyte-mediated response that impairs cognition.
In mice, immune responses are not well characterized beyond the
first few weeks after stroke. However, in human stroke survivors,
there is evidence of immunoglobulin synthesis in the CSF even
weeks to months after stroke (Roström and Link, 1981; Tsementzis
et al., 1986; Prüss et al., 2012). B-lymphocytes themselves have not
previously been reported in human or mouse strokes, but
B-lymphocyte aggregates occur in the meninges in both experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice and multiple sclerosis (MS) in humans (Galea et al., 2007), and also in the
lesion in a mouse model of spinal cord injury (Ankeny and Popovich, 2010). In the injured spinal cord, they produce autoantibodies that bind to nuclear antigens that can cross-react with
neuronal antigens, and mice that lack B-lymphocytes have improved
recovery (Ankeny et al., 2006; Ankeny and Popovich, 2010). Ectopic
lymphoid tissues that contain B- and T-lymphocytes are also observed outside the CNS in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic
chronic inflammatory states and correlate with increased severity of

autoimmune disease or infection (Carragher et al., 2008; Varallyay et
al., 2013).
To investigate the possibility that a B-lymphocyte-mediated
immune response after stroke might mediate some of the increased
risk of dementia in stroke survivors, we first asked whether chronic
inflammation occurs weeks after stroke in wild-type mice. We
characterized the immune response that was present 7 weeks after
stroke, with particular attention to B-lymphocytes and antibodyproducing plasma cells. We next developed a mouse model of
delayed cognitive decline after stroke using wild-type C57BL/6J
mice and confirmed it in a second mouse strain, BALB/CJ mice.
We then used B-cell-deficient mice and a B-cell-depleting antibody to test the hypothesis that B-lymphocyte responses cause
delayed cognitive impairment. Finally, we obtained brain tissue
from human subjects that suffered from stroke and dementia and
asked whether there was a difference in B-lymphocyte density
and IgG immunoreactivity in the brain compared with controls.
Our data indicate that mice develop a B-lymphocyte-mediated
autoimmune response that causes delayed cognitive dysfunction
and that some humans develop a similar response.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Adult mice were male, 3- to 5-months-old, C57BL/6J, muMT
(C57BL/6J background, Jax stock #002288), or BALB/CJ purchased from
the The Jackson Laboratory. All procedures met National Institutes of
Health guidelines with the approval of the Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Stroke surgery. In BALB/CJ mice, distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (DMCAO) was performed as previously described (Doyle et al.,
2012). Sham surgeries were identical to stroke surgeries, except for ligation of the distal middle cerebral artery. C57BL/6J mice were given 8%
oxygen for 1 h immediately after DMCAO. We refer to this variation of
DMCAO as DH stroke (DMCAO ⫹ hypoxia). This period of hypoxia
induces vasoconstriction and compensates for extensive collateralization
between the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery present in
C57BL/6J mice (Doyle et al., 2012).
For all experiments, mice received one dose of the antibiotic cefazolin,
25 mg/kg s.c., immediately after surgery. Mice that underwent sham DH
stroke were also given 8% oxygen for 1 h immediately after surgery.
DMCAO in BALB/CJ mice and DH stroke in C57BL/6J mice generate
equivalent lesions (Doyle et al., 2012). Core body temperature was maintained at 37°C throughout surgery. Mice were returned to their cages
with free access to food and water after closure of the surgical wound.
Infarct assessment was performed as previously described using 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining (Doyle et al., 2012). Sixty minutes
of transient proximal intraluminal filament middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed as previously described (Arac et al., 2011).
For photothrombotic stroke, an incision was made on the top of the head
to expose the skull. A 5-mm-diameter optic cable connected to a metal
halide fiber-optic illuminator (Dolan-Jenner MH-100) was then placed
on top of the skull using a stereotactic frame. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 40 mg/kg Rose Bengal (Sigma, #330000-5G) dissolved
in saline, and 5 min later the light source was turned on for 15 min.
Mouse immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Hematoxylin
and eosin staining and immunostaining were performed as described
using standard techniques on PFA-fixed 40 ␮m coronal brain sections
(Doyle et al., 2010). Primary antibodies were against B220 (biotinylated,
1:500; BD Biosciences, 553085), CD11c (1:500; Abcam, ab33483), IgG
(biotinylated, 1:1000; Vector, BA-2000), CD3 (1:500; BD Biosciences,
550277), MHCII (I-A/I-E, 1:500; BD Biosciences, 553621), CD68 (1:
1000; Serotec, MCA1957), and Iba1 (1:1000; Wako, 019-19741). The
specificity of primary antibody staining was confirmed using control
sections treated with secondary antibody alone. For Table 1, cells were
counted using National Institutes of Health ImageJ cell counting software in the stroke core in two sections per mouse (n ⫽ 6). For Figure 7C,
quantification of CD3 immunostaining was performed on two sections
per mouse blinded to treatment/genotype. Quantification of IgG immu-

nostaining was performed in one section per mouse blinded to treatment. A photomicrograph of the region shown in Figure 8E (black box)
was assayed for mean gray value using ImageJ.
Brain flow cytometry. Cells were stained with fluorescent antibodies
(CD3, CD19, and CD138) using standard techniques, analyzed using a
FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and quantified using FlowJo
software (TreeStar). To isolate immune cells in the brain 7 weeks following stroke, we pooled 10 mice and incubated brain homogenates with
collagenase (Roche) and DNase (Sigma) for 1 h at 37°C and purified the
cells by Percoll gradient centrifugation. Cells were gated by forward scatter and side scatter to identify lymphocytes, using spleen as a control. For
Figure 1E, cells were subsequently gated by CD19 high expression.
ELISA identification of antibody isotypes in the brain. Seven weeks following stroke or sham surgery, mice were perfused with saline, and the
cortex and hippocampus were dissected. Tissue was immersed in lysis
buffer (Sigma CelLytic MT Mammalian Tissue Lysis Reagent containing
Sigma protease inhibitor mixture and Sigma phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2) at a ratio of 1:20 and sonicated. Following centrifugation, the
protein concentration of the supernatant was calculated and normalized
to 10 mg/ml. Antibody concentrations in the cortex and hippocampus
were then measured using a rapid ELISA mouse antibody isotyping kit
(Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (sham
n ⫽ 3, stroke n ⫽ 5–7).
Multiplex immunoassay for quantifying cytokine and antibody concentrations in plasma and in the stroke lesion. After stroke or sham surgery,
100 – 400 ␮l blood was collected by cardiac puncture under anesthesia,
placed in EDTA tubes, and centrifuged to obtain plasma. Mice were then
perfused with sterile saline, and dissected brain tissue immersed in lysis
buffer (Sigma CelLytic MT Mammalian Tissue Lysis Reagent containing
Sigma protease inhibitor mixture and Sigma phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2) at a ratio of 1:20 and sonicated. Following centrifugation, the
protein concentration of the supernatant was calculated and normalized
to 1 mg/ml. Cytokines, chemokines, and antibody isotypes were then
detected and quantified by multiplex immunoassay. Mouse multiplex
kits were purchased from Affymetrix and Millipore and used according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Each sample was measured in
duplicate. Plates were read using a Luminex instrument, and results were
analyzed using Prism software.
Acute slice preparation and whole-cell recordings. Mice were decapitated
after deep isoflurane anesthesia. The forebrain was removed and placed
in ice-cold dissection media consisting of 228 mM sucrose, 26 mM
NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose, 7.0 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.0 mM NaH2PO4,
and 0.5 mM CaCl2. Coronal slices from the dorsal hippocampus were cut
in 225-␮m-thick sections using a vibratome (Leica, VT1200S) and transferred to an incubation chamber containing artificial CSF (ACSF) consisting of 122 mM NaCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose, 2.5 mM CaCl2,
2.5 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgCl2, and 1.0 mM NaH2PO4. Slices were incubated
for 30 min at 32°C and then kept at room temperature until use. Experiments were performed 1–5 h after the incubation period. Slices were
transferred to a submerged recording chamber perfused with ACSF
(28°C–30°C). Picrotoxin (50 ␮M dissolved in DMSO, Sigma) was added
to block inhibitory currents. Pyramidal neurons in the CA1 layer were
visualized by infrared differential interference contrast on an upright
microscope (Olympus BX51WI). Whole-cell recordings from these cells
were obtained with patch electrodes containing 117.5 mM cesium methanesulfonate, 15.5 mM CsCl, 10 mM TEA-Cl, 10 mM HEPES buffer, 10 mM
sodium phosphocreatine, 8 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 4 mM
Mg-ATP, 0.3 mM Na-GTP, and 1 mM QX-314. Electrode resistances

ranged from 2.5 to 4.5 M⍀. To record EPSCs, cells were held at ⫺70 mV
while stimulating the Schaffer collaterals (at 0.1 Hz) with small, brief
current pulses (10 –50 ␮A, 0.2 ms) using a double-barreled glass pipette
(theta glass, Warner) filled with ACSF. Following a 5 min baseline period,
LTP was induced by two trains of high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz,
1 s) separated by 20 s while holding the cells at 0 mV. The induction
protocol was always applied within 10 min of achieving whole-cell
configuration, to avoid “wash-out” of LTP. Following induction,
stimulation at 0.1 Hz was resumed and the EPSC amplitude monitored for 50 min.
Electrophysiological data acquisition and analysis. EPSCs were recorded
in a whole-cell voltage clamp (Multiclamp 700B, Molecular Devices),
filtered at 4 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz (ITC-18 interface, HEKA).
Series resistance and whole-cell capacitance were not compensated. All
electrophysiological data were acquired and analyzed using the Recording Artist package (Dr. Rick Gerkin) written in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics).
To generate LTP summary time course graphs, individual experiments
were normalized to the baseline and six consecutive responses were averaged to generate 1 min bins. The binned time courses of all experiments
within a group were then averaged to generate the final graphs. The
magnitude of LTP was calculated based on the normalized EPSC amplitudes 46 –50 min after the end of the induction protocols.
Y maze spontaneous alternation test. Mice were tested in a Y-shaped
maze with three white, opaque plastic arms set at a 120° angle from
each other. Mice were placed in the center of the maze and allowed to
freely explore the three arms for 5– 8 min until 20 entries had been
achieved. Over the course of multiple entries, normal mice typically
exhibit a tendency to visit new arms of the maze rather than visiting a
recently visited arm. An entry was recorded when all four limbs of the
mouse were within an arm. The number of arm entries and the number of triads were recorded to calculate the percentage of spontaneous
alternation.

Object location test (OLT). Mice were habituated to an empty arena
containing spatial cues on the walls for 5 min. Mice were then returned to
their home cage while four objects were placed in the arena. The objects
were children’s building blocks of different shapes and colors, and each
was placed in a corner of the arena, 5 cm from the walls. Mice were
allowed to explore the objects for 5 min and then were returned to their
home cage. The positions of two of the objects were then switched. Mice
were returned to the arena, and the number of rears on each object was
recorded for a further 5 min. This test is based on the spontaneous
tendency of rodents to spend more time exploring an object that has been
relocated.
Treatment with anti-CD20 antibody. Mice were injected in the tail vein
with 10 mg/kg anti-CD20 antibody (clone 5D2, isotype IgG2a, Genentech), or isotype control (anti-ragweed IgG2a, Genentech) beginning 5 d
after stroke or sham surgery (n ⫽ 10 per group). Drug treatment was
repeated every 2 weeks thereafter, and B-cell ablation was monitored
every 7 d after drug treatment by flow cytometric analysis of a tail blood
sample from each mouse using antibodies against CD3 (T-lymphocytes)
and CD19 (B-lymphocytes).
Human tissue. Paraffin-embedded human brain sections from the
stroke core of subjects with vascular dementia and stroke were obtained
from the Rush Religious Orders Study (16 subjects) (Bennett et al.,
2012a) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (5 subjects) (Bennett et
al., 2012b). Tissue was from 21 stroke patients of mixed gender. Hematoxylin and eosin sections superficial and deep to the lesion were studied
to ensure that infarcted tissue was within the sections used for study.
Frontal cortex sections from 9 age-matched controls that did not have
either stroke or dementia were also provided. Tissue was immunostained
using standard techniques with an anti-CD20 antibody (1:500; Dako
M0755). Total CD20 ⫹ cells present in each slide were counted and divided by the area of tissue present on the slide to obtain the number of

Statistical analysis. All animal experiments were designed to ensure
humane endpoints and minimize numbers of mice and suffering. Allocation of mice into stroke and sham groups was performed randomly,
and behavior experiments were performed with the experimenter blind
to treatment group. For immunostaining and electrophysiology, blinding was not possible because of the stroke lesion being clearly visible in
the stroke groups. Data are expressed as mean ⫾ SEM unless otherwise
indicated in the figure legend. Statistical analyses were performed with
Prism 5 software (GraphPad). Means between two groups were compared with a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test, except in the case of
B-cell densities, which were compared by a Mann–Whitney test. Differences in cytokine/chemokine expression in the lesion of WT and muMT
mice and in antibody isotype concentrations in mouse brain were compared using a two-way ANOVA. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Mann’s
post hoc analysis was used to compare B-cell densities in IgG ⫹ and IgG ⫺
subjects with control.

Results
To determine whether a B-lymphocyte response develops in the
brain after stroke and contributes to delayed cognitive impairment, we searched for a mouse model of stroke that does not
cause immediate cognitive impairment and thus could be used to
look for the development of delayed cognitive deficits.
The most commonly used mouse stroke model, intraluminal
filament MCAO, can cause immediate cognitive impairment,
making it difficult to detect or study any delayed symptoms that
might result from an adaptive immune response to stroke (Hattori et al., 2000; Truong et al., 2012). However, from our previous
work (Doyle et al., 2012), we identified an experimental stroke
paradigm: the DH stroke model in C57BL/6J mice that produces
a lesion adjacent to, but not incorporating, the hippocampus and
does not cause immediate cognitive impairment. This character-

istic renders this model ideal for studying stroke-induced dementia. DH stroke creates a large lesion comprising 25% of the
stroked hemisphere, has little variability, and excellent long-term
survivability (Doyle et al., 2012).
We discovered that there is substantial delayed infiltration of
B-lymphocytes into infarcted tissue in the weeks after DH stroke.
B-lymphocytes are virtually undetectable in the lesion 1 week
after stroke (⬍1 cell per 40-␮m-thick coronal brain section), but
there is extensive infiltration at 7 weeks that is still present at 12
weeks following stroke (Fig. 1A–C). B-lymphocytes are surrounded by cells expressing the dendritic cell marker CD11c (Fig.
1C). Dendritic cells can transfer antigen to naive B cells to initiate
antigen-specific antibody responses and can provide B cells with
isotype-switching signals (Wykes and MacPherson, 2000). Additionally, we observed that whenever T cells and B cells were clustered
together, they were compartmentalized. B cells formed the center of
each cluster and were surrounded by a ring of T cells (Fig. 1D). A
total of 9% of the CD19 ⫹ B-lymphocytes coexpressed CD138, a
marker of immunoglobulin-synthesizing plasma cells (Fig. 1E).
To test whether the plasma cells in the stroke lesion were
producing antibodies, we immunostained brain tissue from mice
killed 7 weeks after stroke with an anti-mouse IgG secondary
antibody. Immunostaining demonstrated extensive IgG in both
the stroke lesion and the area adjacent to the stroke lesion, which
includes the hippocampus (Fig. 1 F, G). Immunostaining was
most intense near the stroke lesion, suggesting that antibody
might be diffusing from the lesion across the glial scar into the
hippocampus and neighboring tissue. A similar finding has been
reported after spinal cord injury (Ankeny et al., 2009; Ankeny and
Popovich, 2010); however, it might also be diffusing from the
bloodstream into this tissue if there is blood– brain barrier dysfunction in this location. In some mice, the pattern of immuno-

findings were observed in two additional independent experiments. D, Equivalent T-cell responses after stroke were also independently observed with CD3 immunostaining in two additional stroke models: MCAO and photothrombotic stroke. This demonstrates that an adaptive
immune response to stroke is not model-dependent in C57BL/6J mice. Scale bars: B, C, 250 ␮m,
10 ␮m; D, 500 ␮m, 100 ␮m (lower and higher magnifications, respectively).

staining was suggestive of autoantibodies binding to cells in the
pyramidal cell layer. The pattern of staining was, however, variable from mouse to mouse.
To identify which antibody isotypes were present in the brain
after stroke, we performed a mouse antibody isotyping ELISA. We
discovered that, in both the lesion and adjacent hippocampus, the
majority of the antibody was IgG (IgG1 and IgG2b), although IgM
and IgA were also present (Fig. 1H). A B-lymphocyte response to
stroke was a consistent finding, seen in the stroke core of every
mouse in each experiment, and also in two additional, distinct,
stroke models: MCAO and photothrombotic stroke (Fig. 1I,J).
To more precisely quantify antibody infiltration into the brain
after stroke and to look for evidence of B-cell activation in the
form of isotype switching between weeks 1 and 7 after stroke, we
performed a multiplex immunoassay for IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b,
IgG3, IgA, and IgM on brain tissue taken from mice following
stroke or sham surgery. The amount of antibody present in the
brain at both 1 and 7 weeks after stroke was approximately equivalent, and it was absent in mice that underwent sham surgery
(Fig. 2A). This indicates that either antibody is not cleared from
the brain in the weeks following stroke once it enters the brain
following acute BBB disruption, or that it persistently diffuses
into the brain from the site of the stroke lesion. In support of
the latter, the amount of IgA present in the brain increased
significantly between week 1 and week 7 (Fig. 2A). This also
indicates that stroke leads to isotype switching in plasma cells.
To determine whether some of the antibody we observe in the
brain following stroke has a blood-borne or local source, we used

J. Neurosci., February 4, 2015 • 35(5):2133–2145 • 2137

a multiplex immunoassay to quantify immunoglobulin in the
plasma of C57BL/6 mice killed 1 and 7 weeks following stroke,
and an immunostain to look for IgA-producing plasma cells
within the stroke lesion 7 weeks following stroke. There was no
detectable increase in IgA within the plasma in the weeks following stroke (Fig. 2B), and IgA-positive cells were present within the
lesion (Fig. 2C). This suggests that, although some of the antibody present in the brain in the weeks following stroke may be
from the blood, at least some of the IgA in the brain at late time
points after stroke is locally produced from plasma cells within
the lesion.
The initial activation of B-lymphocytes, and subsequent isotype switching, is predominantly T-cell dependent (Bishop and
Hostager, 2001). Therefore, to investigate whether our discovery
of a B-lymphocyte response to stroke is part of a larger adaptive
immune response to stroke, we looked for the presence and relative abundance of T cells, MHCII expression, and markers of
activated microglia/macrophages in the brain 7 weeks following
stroke. We discovered that stroke lesions contain abundant
T-lymphocytes (CD3 ⫹), MHCII-expressing cells, and activated
microglia/macrophages (CD68 ⫹, Iba1 ⫹) at this time point (Fig.
3 A, B; Table 1) as well as at 12 weeks following stroke (data not
shown). Interestingly, in contrast to the strict localization of B
cells within stroke lesions, T cells, MHCII expression, and markers of activated microglia/macrophages (CD68 and MHCII),
were also detected in the thalamus, striatum, and internal capsule
of each mouse 7 weeks after stroke (n ⫽ 10). These locations
normally contain the axons of neurons that project from the
sensorimotor cortex (McGeorge and Faull, 1989), which is the
cortical region that has undergone stroke in these mice. Also, at 7
weeks after injury, Wallerian degeneration is ongoing (Vargas
and Barres, 2007). This may then mean that, where slow axonal
degeneration occurs, there is a chronic inflammatory response
around degenerating axons for weeks after the stroke (Fig. 3C).
We did not find B cells in this region (data not shown). CD3 ⫹
T-cell infiltration in the brain was also observed 4 weeks following MCAO and photothrombotic stroke (Fig. 3D), demonstrating that the adaptive immune response identified with DH stroke
is not stroke model specific.
Much of the antibody that is present in the mouse brain 7
weeks after DH stroke is in the hippocampus (Fig. 1 F, G). LTP is
one of the main neural mechanisms by which memory is stored in
the hippocampus (Lynch, 2004). To determine whether antibody
binding in this region impairs LTP, EPSCs were recorded from
CA1 pyramidal neurons following stimulation of Schaffer collaterals projecting from CA3 pyramidal neurons. LTP was not impaired 1 week after stroke, a time point when few B cells are
detectable in the lesion. Seven and 12 weeks after stroke, when
there is extensive B-cell infiltration in the lesion and antibody
infiltration in the hippocampus, there was significant and progressive impairment of LTP (Fig. 4 A, B).
To determine whether the impaired LTP impacted cognition, we
examined whether mice developed a memory deficit in the weeks
after stroke. We used the Y maze, a hippocampal-dependent spatial
memory task that measures the preference of rodents to explore a
novel environment, and relies on their ability to remember which
arms of the maze they have previously explored. Between weeks 1
and 7 following stroke, coincident with B-cell accumulation, mice
developed a short-term memory deficit (Fig. 4C).
To verify that delayed cognitive impairment after stroke was
generalizable to other models and not solely a function of the DH
stroke model or of the C57BL/6J mouse strain, BALB/CJ mice
underwent DMCAO stroke. The lesion following DMCAO in

Figure 4. Mice develop a deficit in LTP in the hippocampus between weeks 1 and 7 after stroke, and a delayed cognitive deficit on the Y maze. A, B, Whole-cell EPSCs were recorded from CA1
pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices prepared from C57BL/6J mice that had undergone stroke or sham surgery 1, 7, and 12 weeks earlier (n ⫽ 6 –9 per group). The time course (A) and

BALB/CJ mice is equivalent in size and location to the lesion
following DH stroke in C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 5A), due to strain
differences in cerebral vascular anatomy (Doyle et al., 2012). Importantly, DMCAO stroke in BALB/CJ mice does not involve
hypoxia. In contrast, during DH stroke mice undergo 60 min of
hypoxia. This duration of hypoxia does not directly injure the
hippocampus (Doyle et al., 2012), and all sham controls in DH
experiments experience the same duration of hypoxia.
Similarly to C57BL/6J mice after DH stroke, BALB/CJ mice exhibit B cells and T cells in the lesion 7 weeks following DMCAO (Fig.
5B). There was also substantial IgM, IgG, and IgA in the brain at
weeks 1 and 7 after stroke (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, again similar to
C57BL/6J mice following DH stroke, the amount of IgA present in
the brain increased significantly between week 1 and week 7. This
demonstrates that B-cell, T-cell, and antibody infiltration into the
brain, as well as isotype switching after stroke, is not dependent on
the hypoxia component of DH stroke. It also demonstrates that these
responses are not strain specific.
BALB/CJ mice were not able to perform the Y maze task after
either sham or stroke surgery due to freezing. However, they were
able to perform another test of hippocampal function, the OLT,
which is based on the ability of mice to remember the prior location
of an object and recognize when it has been moved. They performed
normally at baseline and 2 weeks following DMCAO and sham surgery (Fig. 5D). BALB/CJ mice that underwent sham surgery also
performed normally 7 weeks following sham surgery. However,
BALB/CJ mice that underwent DMCAO were unable to perform
this test 7 weeks following stroke. This demonstrates that the hypoxia component of DH stroke is not necessary for delayed cognitive
dysfunction to occur after stroke.
To test the hypothesis that B-lymphocytes contribute to the
development of the delayed onset short-term memory deficit,
perhaps through antibody accumulation in the hippocampus
and the binding of autoreactive antibodies (Kowal et al., 2004),
muMT mice that lack mature B-lymphocytes underwent stroke

and memory testing. muMT mice indeed did not develop a delayed LTP deficit (Fig. 6 A, B), or a cognitive deficit on either
hippocampal memory task, the OLT and the Y maze (Fig. 6C,D).
To investigate the mechanism by which muMT mice are protected from delayed cognitive dysfunction following stroke, we
compared lesion size, B-cell and antibody infiltration, T-cell infiltration, and cytokine expression in muMT mice and WT mice.
Infarct volumes 72 h following stroke were equivalent in muMT
and WT mice (Fig. 7A). Also, as expected, we did not detect B cells
or IgG in the stroke lesion in muMT mice (Fig. 7B). However,
T-cell infiltration and the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were equivalent in the lesion in muMT and
WT mice 7 weeks after stroke (Fig. 7C,D). These data suggest that
the mechanism by which B cells cause cognitive impairment after
stroke is antibody mediated, rather than by an effect on T cells or
cytokine production.
To investigate the translational potential of ablating B-lymphocytes after stroke, we tested whether ablating B cells using an
anti-CD20 antibody could also prevent the emergence of delayed
cognitive deficits. Based on our finding that it took longer than 1
week after stroke for most B-lymphocytes to infiltrate the brain,
we initiated treatment five days after stroke. Mice received either
a B-lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody (Kozakiewicz et al., 2013), or an isotype control antibody, via tail vein
injection every 2 weeks following the first injection, for a total of
6 weeks. Anti-CD20 antibody treatment successfully ablated B
cells in the circulation (Fig. 8 A, B), prevented the appearance of
delayed cognitive deficits (Fig. 8C), and prevented the recruitment of B cells and IgG to the brain (Fig. 8D–F ). None of these
effects was observed in mice treated with the control antibody.
Anti-CD20 antibody treatment did not ablate T cells in the circulation (Fig. 8A) or alter T-cell recruitment to brain after stroke
(data not shown).
Finally, to determine whether this new mouse model might
be relevant to human post-stroke dementia, we evaluated

B-lymphocyte responses in human postmortem brain tissue from
the Rush Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (Bennett et al., 2012a, b; Boyle et al., 2013). Our criteria were the
presence of infarct and no pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease or other neuropathological disorder. Controls were matched
subjects without stroke or dementia. We immunostained sections
containing ischemic infarcts with CD20 to detect B cells (Fig. 9A).
We discovered ⱖ1 B-lymphocytes/cm 2 in the stroke core and
area adjacent to the stroke core in 19 of 21 subjects (Fig. 9; Table 2).
Nine of the subjects had 1–10 B-lymphocytes/cm 2 in the ischemic
area, 9 exhibited 11–100, and 1 had ⬎100 B-lymphocytes/cm 2. In 9
control subjects, B-lymphocyte density ranged from 0 to 3.6 lymphocytes/cm 2, significantly different from those with stroke (Fig.
9B). These results suggest that a B-lymphocyte response to stroke
occurs in the CNS after stroke in some people.
Furthermore, IgG immunostaining revealed that antibodies are
present in the brain in stroke survivors to a greater extent than in
controls. Control brains uniformly contained IgG in the white mat-

ter, vasculature, and meninges, with little to no immunostaining in
the neuropil. In contrast, sections from 5 of the 21 stroke subjects exhibited cellular patterns of IgG immunostaining that appeared different
from subject to subject. This may be indicative of autoantibodies binding to a diverse array of CNS antigens. Figure 9C depicts 1 of 2 control
subjects whose brain exhibited light immunostaining for IgG and also

Discussion
Our findings in mice demonstrate that B-lymphocyte-mediated
inflammation in a stroke lesion can directly impact cognition. To
our knowledge, this is the first time that chronic inflammatory
responses in the infarct core in general, or B-lymphocyte re-

sponses in particular, have been shown to cause delayed-onset
cognitive impairment after stroke.
We found that by 4 –7 weeks after stroke there are both B- and
T-lymphocytes present in the stroke core in four different stroke
models: DH, transient proximal MCAO, and photothrombotic
stroke in wild-type C57BL/6J mice, and DMCAO stroke in wildtype BALB/CJ mice. We also demonstrated that mice develop
delayed cognitive deficits following DH stroke in C57BL/6J mice
and DMCAO in BALB/CJ mice. We used these mouse models
because they do not cause an immediate cognitive deficit, and
different stroke models in each strain because they each have
different vulnerabilities to DMCAO.
In BALB/CJ mice, DMCAO generates a lesion that incorporates the frontal and parietal cortex and is adjacent to, but does
not incorporate, the hippocampus. In C57BL/6J mice, DMCAO
only generates a small lesion in the frontal cortex, and hypoxia is
required to enlarge the lesion to the parietal cortex and place it in
closer proximity to the hippocampus (Doyle et al., 2012). In both
models, an immediate short-term memory deficit is lacking.

However, mice develop a deficit within 7 weeks of a DH or
DMCAO stroke. C57BL/6J mice that underwent DMCAO (without hypoxia) did not develop a short-term memory deficit (data
not shown). Enlargement of the lesion in C57BL/6J mice might be important for the emergence of the delayed cognitive deficit because the
larger lesion is in cortex adjacent to the hippocampus.
The delayed appearance of cognitive deficits in our mouse
models mimics what is observed in human studies where stroke
survivors without dementia have an at least twofold risk of developing dementia in the decade following their stroke (Desmond et
al., 2002; Ivan et al., 2004). The chronic inflammation we observe
in mice is also consistent with the B-lymphocytes and human IgG
we observed in the brains of people who died with stroke and
dementia. Consistent with our findings here, Mena et al. (2004)
and Mărgăritescu et al. (2009) reported persistent immune cell
infiltration, sometimes decades after stroke, in ⬃40% of human
cerebral infarcts stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Within the stroke lesion in mice, B-lymphocytes aggregated
into clusters and were surrounded by macrophages and

2142 • J. Neurosci., February 4, 2015 • 35(5):2133–2145

Doyle et al. • B-Lymphocytes Impair Cognition Late after Stroke

T-lymphocytes, and so may represent tertiary lymphoid structures. Similar aggregates have been found in sites of chronic
inflammation in other diseases, where
they correlate with increased severity of
disease (Ankeny et al., 2006, 2009; Carragher et al., 2008; Ankeny and Popovich,
2010; Neyt et al., 2012). In addition to
IgG, we found evidence of IgA production
in mice, similar to that reported in human
multiple sclerosis (Bernheimer et al.,
1983; Zhang et al., 2005).
Chronic inflammation is unlikely to be
due to bacterial brain infection because it
occurs in photothrombotic stroke, which
does not require the skull to be opened.
There was also no evidence of bacteria on
hematoxylin and eosin stains of brain sections from C57BL/6J mice killed on days
1, 3, and 7 or 1 and 3 months after DH
stroke (data not shown).
B-lymphocyte aggregates have been
found in mice in the injured spinal cord
where they produce antibodies and impair recovery (Ankeny and Popovich,
2010). Here, we showed that a substantial
amount of antibody is present in areas of
the brain adjacent to B-cell clusters that
form in the stroke core. We speculate that
plasma cells in the stroke core might be
producing autoreactive antibodies or antibodies that activate Fc receptors and
complement, and that those antibodies
diffuse into the surrounding tissue and
cause neurological dysfunction. In support of this hypothesis, we observed a deficit in hippocampal LTP in a time frame
similar to that of antibody accumulation.
The development of a deficit in LTP could

stroke, the data we present here demonstrate that B cells cause
later neurologic impairment weeks after stroke. This may be similar to the reciprocal role of B cells in experimental EAE. In EAE,
IL10-expressing regulatory B cells are beneficial early in disease,
but other B cells are detrimental later (Matsushita et al., 2008).
We postulate that, early in stroke, IL10-producing regulatory B
cells may be beneficial, whereas later during recovery from stroke,
autoantibody-producing plasma cells become detrimental.
We also postulate that the mechanism by which
B-lymphocytes contribute to cognitive dysfunction after stroke is
via the production of brain-reactive antibodies. Brain-reactive
antibodies are linked to pathogenesis in many other neurological
disorders, such as spinal cord injury, systemic lupus erythematosus, and neuromyelitis optica, and can recognize and interfere
with many molecules important for key brain functions, such as
neurotransmission, blood– brain barrier function, and protein
translation (for review, see Diamond et al., 2009). In addition,
autoantibodies can ligate Fc receptors, initiate cytokine signaling
pathways, and activate complement. It is not yet clearly established by which of these mechanisms brain-reactive antibodies
contribute to symptoms of disease in the CNS, but it is likely that
a different combination of mechanisms is important in different
diseases and individuals.
The mechanism by which B-lymphocytes contribute to cognitive dysfunction is likely to involve T-lymphocytes. We found
abundant T-lymphocytes and MHCII expression in the lesion
and in an area of Wallerian degeneration 7 weeks following
stroke, and the presence of these cells, in conjunction with pro-

inflammatory cytokines is suggestive that stroke elicits a prolonged T-lymphocyte response within the brain. Additionally, we
found evidence of isotype switching, which is typically T-celldependent (Bishop and Hostager, 2001; Cerutti, 2008), with increased IgA present in the brain 7 weeks following stroke in both
mouse models. However, muMT mice did not develop delayed
cognitive deficits after stroke yet had equivalent T-cell infiltration
and cytokine concentrations in the brain as wild-type C57BL/6J
mice. These T-cell responses alone were thus not sufficient to
cause electrophysiologic or cognitive deficits in the absence of
B-lymphocytes.
There are limitations to using rodents to model cognitive dysfunction in humans. For instance, stroke patients often have multiple comorbidities, such as age, periventricular white matter
disease, other types of vascular dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease
(Barba et al., 2000; Ivan et al., 2004; Leys et al., 2005; Troncoso et
al., 2008; Savva and Stephan, 2010; Gorelick et al., 2011; Iadecola,
2013). Indeed, in human populations, classic neuropathological
findings of disease, including strokes and other vascular pathology, explain only 41% of the risk of overall cognitive decline
(Boyle et al., 2013). However, we present evidence here from
autopsy tissue that implicates B-lymphocyte infiltration as a
novel factor that potentially confers an increased risk of cognitive
decline to humans with stroke and may contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of cognitive impairment. It will
now be important to define both the duration and characteristics
of adaptive immune responses in people who have suffered a

stroke and determine whether they correlate with the development of poststroke dementia in some patients.
