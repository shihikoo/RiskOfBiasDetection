Background/Purpose: Repetitive hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy may cause excessive generation of reactive oxygen species. This study assessed whether repetitive or 2e4-day trials of
HBO2 therapy (2 treatments daily for 2e4 consecutive days) provides better effects in reducing
brain inflammation and oxidative stress caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in
rats than did a 1-day trial of HBO2 therapy (2 treatments for 1 day).
Methods: Rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham; MCAO without HBO2 treatment;
MCAO treated with 1-day trial of HBO2; and MCAO treated with 2e4-day trials of HBO2. One
treatment of HBO2 (100% O2 at 253 kPa) lasted for 1 hour in a hyperbaric chamber.
Results: Therapy with the 2e4-day trials of HBO2 significantly and dose-dependently attenuated
the MCAO-induced cerebral infarction and neurological deficits more than the 1-day trial of HBO2
therapy. The beneficial effects of repetitive HBO2 therapy were associated with: (1) reduced inflammatory status in ischemic brain tissues (evidenced by decreased levels of tumor necrosis
factor-a, interleukin-1b, and myeloperoxidase activity); (2) decreased oxidative damage in
ischemic brain tissues (evidenced by decreased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species,
lipid peroxidation, and enzymatic pro-oxidants, but increased levels of enzymatic antioxidant
defenses); and (3) increased production of an anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10.

Introduction
Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy at a single dose is associated with decreased brain neurtrophil infiltration1 and
myeloperoxidase activity2 in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In experimental MCAO, one dose of HBO2
therapy is also associated with downregulation of
cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA and protein levels (an inducible
enzyme responsible for elaboration of inflammatory prostanoids, prostaglandins, prastacyclins, and thromboxane),3
suggesting that single HBO2 therapy may improve outcomes
of MCAO by reducing brain inflammation. In addition, inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by an
antioxidant is found to be beneficial in treating MCAO rats.4
However, prolonged or repetitive HBO2 therapy may cause
excessive generation of ROS in rat lung5 and in patients.6
Neuroprotection by HBO2 after MCAO is not found to be
associated with decreased lipid peroxidation.7 It remains
unclear whether repetitive HBO2 therapy provides better
effects on brain inflammation and oxidative damage in rats
with focal cerebral ischemia.
This study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of a 1-day trial (2 HBO2 treatments in one day) or 2e4day trial (2 HBO2 treatments daily and consecutively for
2e4 days) of HBO2 therapy on both brain inflammation and
oxidative stress caused by transient focal cerebral ischemia
in rats. Therefore, by using the transient MCAO rat model,
brain levels of proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin-1b
(IL-1b), and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)], an antiinflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and a leukocyte accumulation indicator [myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity] were
measured as indicators for brain inflammation. By contrast,
brain levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, nitric oxide (NO), and 2,3dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) were measured as indicators for oxidative stress. The expected results would
elucidate whether heightened oxygen tension by repetitive
HBO2 reduced oxidative stress, which was reflected by
increased antioxidant and decreased oxidant contents
under focal cerebral ischemia.

relatively noninvasive technique previously described by
Belayev et al.8 To allow reperfusion, the nylon filament was
withdrawn 90 minutes after MCAO. The anesthetized animals were allowed to awaken and were kept in their cages
with free access to food and water. All protocols, designed
to minimize discomfort in the animals during surgery and in
the recovery period, were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Chi Mei Medical Center
(Tainan, Taiwan) with a reference number of IACUC
Approval No: 100120717.

HBO2 therapy and animal groups

Methods

There were 192 rats randomly assigned to one of six groups:
MCAO0T (MCAO rats untreated and euthanized 7 days postMCAO; n Z 32); MCAO1T (MCAO rats treated 3 hours after
surgery with HBO2 twice for 1 day and euthanized 7 days
post-MCAO; n Z 32); MCAO2T (MCAO rats treated 3 hours
after surgery with HBO2 twice daily for consecutive 2 days
and euthanized 7 days post-MCAO; n Z 32); MCAO3T (MCAO
rats treated 3 hours after surgery with HBO2 twice a day for
consecutive 3 days and killed 7 days post-MCAO; n Z 32);
MCAO4T (MCAO rats treated 3 hours after surgery with HBO2
twice a day for consecutive 4 days and euthanized 7 days
post-MCAO; n Z 32); and sham (sham-MCAO rats untreated
and euthanized 7 days post-MCAO; n Z 32). All tests were
done with researchers blinded to which groups the rats were
in; group codes were revealed only after all behavioral and
histologic analyses had been completed. In MCAO groups
treated with HBO2, rats were placed in a custom-made
pressure chamber of transparent acrylic plastic (Space
Research Institute, Beijing, China) and given 1 hour of HBO2
at 2.0 ata in 100% O2 twice a day for 1e4 days. The chamber
was flushed with 100% oxygen at a rate of 5 L/minute to
avoid carbon dioxide accumulation. Decompression was
done at 0.2 kg/cm2/minute. During HBO2 exposure, oxygen
and carbon dioxide content were continuously monitored
and maintained at 98% O2 and 0.03% CO2. The pressure
chamber temperature was maintained between 22 C and
25 C. To minimize the effects of diurnal variation, all HBO2
exposures were started at approximately 2:00 PM. MCAO-0 T
or sham-MCAO was treated with normobaric air at 1.0 ata
in 21% oxygen at an ambient temperature of 22e25 C.

Animals

Neurological and motor function evaluation

Adult male SpragueeDawley rats (Animal Research Center
of the National Science of the Republic of China (Taipei,
Taiwan)) (weight, 246  8 g) were housed under environmental conditions with ambient temperature of 22  1 C,
relative humidity of 65% and 12-hour light/dark cycle, with
free access to food and water. Brain focal ischemia was
induced by MCAO in rats by intraluminal filament, using the

All rats were evaluated using a neurological severity score
(NSS),9 which is a composite of the motor (muscle status,
abnormal movement), sensory (visual, tactile, and proprioceptive) and reflex tests. The inclined plane was used to
measure limb strength. Animals were placed, facing right
and left, perpendicular to the slope of a 20 cm  20 cm
ruffer ribbed surface of an inclined plane starting at angle

622
of 55 .10 Measurements of both NSS and motor deficits were
conducted the day prior to surgery and 7 days after surgery.

Cerebral infarction assessment
Rats with deep anesthesia were transcardially perfused
with heparinized 0.05 M phosphate-buffered saline followed by ice-cold 15% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline. The brains were rapidly removed and frozen in liquid
and then sectioned for immunohistochemistry. Eight serial
sections from each brain were cut at 2-mm intervals from
the frontal pole using a rat brain matrix (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). To measure ischemic change,
brain slices were stained in a solution containing 2% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride in saline at 37 C as detailed
previously.11 We also made correction of the distortion of
infarct volume caused by brain edema in reference to the
report of Lin et al.12

Assessment of free radical compounds
All animals were sacrificed at 7 days after MCAO. Under
deep anesthesia (sodium pentobarbital, 100 mg/kg,

L.-F. Chen et al.
intraperitoneally), animals were perfused intracardially
with saline. The injured brain tissue proper (core region)
was then removed and dissected out the cortex for determination of MDA, GPx, GR, and SOD, contents. As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the marked infarction focus was dissected
out of the brain for the above-mentioned laboratory tests
for free radical compounds.
Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring the levels
of MDA with 2-thiobarbituric acid to form a chromophore
absorbing at 532 nm.13 The values of lipid peroxidation are
expressed as nanomoles of 2-thiobarbituric acid-reactive
substance (MDA equivalent)/mg of protein.14
SOD was analyzed with a SOD activity commercial kit
(Oxis Research, Portland, OR, USA). The SOD activity is
determined from the ratio of the autoxidation rates in the
presence (Vx) and the absence (Vc) of SOD. One unit is
defined as the activity that doubles the autoxidation rate of
the control bland (Vx/Vc Z 2). Protein concentration was
determined by the method of Lowry et al.15 NO levels were
measured using an high performance liquid chromatography-nitric oxide (HPLC-NO) detector system (ENO-10;
Eicom, Kyoto, Japan) as reported previously.16 These
oxidative NO products were also evaluated as NOx. The
concentrations of hydroxyl radicals were measured by a

Cytokine contents of ischemic cerebral
homogenate
Cerebral hemispheres were quickly dissected free and kept
on ice in physiological salt solution containing 5 mM
glucose. Segments of ipsilateral cerebral cortex (75 mg;
i.e., approximately the weight of each cerebral hemisphere) were weighed, cut into small pieces, dispersed by
aspiration into a pipette and suspended in 1 mL of physiological salt solution in a test tube. Samples were kept on
wet ice for 20 minutes prior to use. The homogenates were
centrifuged at 5150g for 20 minutes. The supernatants were
used for measuring TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-10 concentrations.
Cytokine concentrations were measured using commercial
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Biosource International Inc., Boshide Company, Wuhan, China) and
following the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were
assayed in duplicate.

Assay of MPO activity
Segments of ipsilateral cerebral cortex were used for
biochemical analysis of MPO activity. Samples were homogenized in 0.5% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide
(HTAB) in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.0; 5.0 mL HTAB
solution/g tissue) ice in a Polytron homogenizer (NS-50;
Teraoka, Osaka, Japan) for 30 seconds. The homogenate
was centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 minutes at 4 C. The
pellet was resuspended in HTAB solution, and sonicated
with an ultrasonic homogenizer (USP-600; Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan) for 90 seconds at full power. The sonicate was
incubated in a water bath at 60 C for 2 hours, and then
centrifuged again. A 100-mL sample of supernatant was
added to 2.9 mL of 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, which
contained 0.167 mg/mL O-dianisidine and 0.0005%
hydrogen peroxide. Absorbance at 460 nm was monitored
for 3 minutes in a spectrophometer (DU-640; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA, USA). Then the MPO activity/g of
wet tissue was calculated as described previously.19

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as the mean  standard error of the
mean for eight animals/group. Data were compared using
the analysis of variances (ANOVA) test followed by a
multiple-comparison test (Scheffe’s test). A p value of
<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Discussion
In the present study, MCAO rats were treated with HBO2
3 hours after surgery. The neurological and motor deficits

625
caused by MCAO in rats are significantly and dosedependently attenuated by HBO2 therapy. Our results are
consistent with previous findings20e22 showing that HBO2
therapy after focal transient cerebral ischemia is frequently
protective.
However,
focal
permanent
cerebral
ischemia4,23,24 is not affected by HBO2 therapy. One report
shows that HBO2 is beneficial even if delayed as long as
24 hours after reperfusion,25 whereas HBO2 therapy, if
adopted 6 hours after reperfusion, may have worse outcomes.24,26 Although it has been demonstrated that HBO2
therapy is beneficial in chronic symptomatic cerebrovascular
diseases,27 human studies in acute ischemic stroke have not
shown the benefit of HBO2 therapy.28e30 There is an apparent
discrepancy in therapeutic outcomes between clinical trials
and animal studies, especially the current one with repetitive HBO2 therapy. Probably, the most striking finding of the
present study is that we demonstrate that repetitive
(or multiple-day trials of) HBO2 therapy display better
beneficial effects on outcomes of focal transient brain
ischemia in rats than did the 1-day trial of HBO2 therapy.
It has been proposed that inflammation after ischemic
stroke contributes to postischemic pathology.31 In MCAO
models, beneficial effect of HBO2 therapy is associated with
decreased neutrophil infiltration1 and reduced brain myeloperoxidase activity.2 Here we have demonstrated that, in
addition to increasing MPO activity, MCAO-treated animals
display higher levels of TNF-a and IL-1b in the ischemic
areas, which can be attenuated by HBO2 therapy. Additionally, our results demonstrate that HBO2 therapy elevates brain levels of IL-10 in MCAO rats. IL-10 is an antiinflammatory cytokine. For example, systemic administration of IL-10 protects mice from endotoxemia by reducing
TNF-a release.32 Neutralization of endogenously produced
IL-10 causes an increased production of proinflammatory
cytokines and enhanced mortality after sepsis.33 IL-10
knockout mice have an increased likelihood of inflammatory illness34 and higher mortality rates after experimental
sepsis.35 Our present results showed that HBO2 therapy induces an increased production of IL-10 but a decreased
production of TNF-a and IL-1b in the ischemic brain in MCAO
rats. Thus, it appears that HBO2 therapy improves outcomes
of MCAO in rats by stimulating IL-10 production but inhibiting production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFa and IL-1b. In fact, our hypothesis can be applied to other
neurodegenerative disease models. For example, animals
with heatstroke injury have increased brain levels of TNF-a,
IL-1b, and MPO, which can be attenuated by HBO2 therapy
in diabetic rats.36 HBO2 therapy is shown to attenuate
traumatic brain injury by reducing both TNF-a production
and MPO activity but stimulating IL-10 production in rats.37
Extreme hyperbaric conditions (4e5 ata  1 hour) may
cause lipid peroxidation and altered enzymatic antioxidative process,38,39 upregulation of NO synthase,39 and
central nervous system oxygen toxicity.40,41 HBO2 therapy
at lower pressure (for example HBO2 therapy pressure of no
greater than 3 ata), is associated with few side effects and
was therefore used in the present study.42 Ischemic brain
injury is associated with the overproduction of free radicals
and ROS in rats.43 Our current results further show that
MCAO injured rats display significantly higher brain levels of
ROS (NO and 2,3-DHBA), lipid peroxidation (MDA), and
enzymatic pro-oxidants (oxidized glutathione (GSSG)/

brain levels of GPx, SOD, and GR for MCAO-2T increased compared with MCOA-1T (p < 0.05). #The brain levels of MDA for MCAO-3T
or MCAO-4T were significantly decreased whereas brain levels of GPx, SOD, and GR for MCAO-3T or MCAO-4T were significantly
decreased compared with MCO-2T, whereas the brain levels of GPs, SOD, and GR for MCAO-3T or MCAO-4T were significantly
increased compared with MCAO-2T (p < 0.05).

reduced glutathione (GSH)), but lower brain levels of
enzymatic antioxidant defenses (GR and GPx) during MCAO.
Increased production of ROS has been reported to be
directly involved in oxidative damage with cellular macromolecules in ischemic brain tissues, which lead to cell
death.44 In MCAO, we first demonstrate that HBO2 therapy
attenuates ischemic stroke in rats by reducing the
increased brain levels of ROS, lipid peroxidation, and
enzymatic pro-oxidants but enhancing brain levels of
enzymatic antioxidant defenses. In particular, we address
apparent contradictory findings that heightened oxygen
tension reduced oxidative stress, which was reflected by
increased antioxidant and decreased oxidant contents
under cerebral ischemia. An antioxidant is also found to be
more beneficial than HBO2 on permanent MCAO in rats.4
Again, brain oxidative stress caused by other neurodegenerative disease models such as heatstroke can also be
suppressed by HBO2 therapy.36

In summary, we have demonstrated that treatment of
MCAO-injured rats with HBO2 protects against MCAOinduced cerebral infarction and neurological and motor
dysfunction. The beneficial effects of HBO2 may be attributed to: (1) inhibition of activated inflammation (increased
brain levels of IL-1b, TNF-a, and MPO); (2) inhibition of
oxidative stress (increased brain levels of ROS, lipid peroxidation, and enzymatic pro-oxidants, but decreased brain
levels of enzymatic antioxidant defenses); and (3) overproduction of an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in
MCAO-injured brain. The beneficial effects exerted by
multiple (2e4) day trials of HBO2 therapy are superior to
those of a 1-day trial of HBO2 therapy in reducing MCAOinduced brain NO-related oxidative stress, inflammation,
and functional deficits in rats. Thus, it can be deduced that
HBO2 therapy may improve outcomes of MCAO by reducing
oxidative stress as well as inflammation in ischemic brain
tissues.
