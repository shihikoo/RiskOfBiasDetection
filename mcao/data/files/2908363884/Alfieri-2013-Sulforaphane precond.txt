Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and cerebral edema are the major pathogenic mechanisms
leading to neurological dysfunction and death after ischemic stroke. The brain protects itself against
infarction via activation of endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms, and we here report the ﬁrst
evidence that sulforaphane-mediated preactivation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and
its downstream target heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in the cerebral vasculature protects the brain against
stroke. To induce ischemic stroke, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 70 min middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo) followed by 4, 24, or 72 h reperfusion. Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expression was
upregulated in cerebral microvessels of peri-infarct regions after 4–72 h, with HO-1 preferentially
associated with perivascular astrocytes rather than the cerebrovascular endothelium. In naïve rats,
treatment with sulforaphane increased Nrf2 expression in cerebral microvessels after 24 h. Upregulation
of Nrf2 by sulforaphane treatment prior to transient MCAo (1 h) was associated with increased HO-1
expression in perivascular astrocytes in peri-infarct regions and cerebral endothelium in the infarct core.
BBB disruption, lesion progression, as analyzed by MRI, and neurological deﬁcits were reduced by
sulforaphane pretreatment. As sulforaphane pretreatment led to a moderate increase in peroxynitrite
generation, we suggest that hormetic preconditioning underlies sulforaphane-mediated protection against
stroke. In conclusion, we propose that pharmacological or dietary interventions aimed to precondition the
brain via activation of the Nrf2 defense pathway in the cerebral microvasculature provide a novel
therapeutic approach for preventing BBB breakdown and neurological dysfunction in stroke.

peri-infarct regions [2]. The central core of stroke-affected areas is
subjected to a marked reduction in oxygen levels and blood ﬂow as
well as rapid necrosis, whereas peripheral areas exhibiting modest or
moderate oxygen and perfusion deﬁcits are potentially salvageable.
These areas, at risk of infarction but not yet irreversibly damaged, form
the ischemic penumbra and are the current focus of recanalization and
neuroprotective therapies in stroke [3].
Microvascular endothelial cells constitute the blood–brain barrier
(BBB) and surrounding astrocytic end-feet regulate barrier permeability, transport, and metabolic functions [4]. The structural and
functional relationship between endothelial cells and astrocytes in
the brain has been deﬁned as the gliovascular complex [5], and
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species function as triggers of BBB
breakdown and cerebral edema, the major pathogenic mechanism
leading to death after stroke [6,7].
Heme oxygenases (HO) provide important endogenous defenses
against oxidative injury in the brain during ischemia and inﬂammation

[8,9]. Delivery of the HO-1 gene via adenoviral transfection or
dexamethasone-loaded peptide vesicles [10,11] protects the brain
against ischemic injury. Moreover, upregulation of HO-1 in the brain
following ischemic preconditioning only protects against ischemic
injury in wild-type but not HO-1–/– mice [12] while treatment with
the HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP attenuates protection against ischemic brain
injury [13]. Constitutive HO-2 and inducible HO-1 are rate-limiting
enzymes in the oxidative degradation of pro-oxidant heme to the
vasodilator carbon monoxide (CO), free iron, biliverdin, and the chainbreaking antioxidant bilirubin [8,14,15]. Intracellular generation of CO
and/or bilirubin via heme oxygenases protects peripheral tissues and
the brain against oxidative stress [16,17]. Notably, low doses of CO
protect against focal transient cerebral ischemia [18] and pretreatment
of rats with CORM-3, a water-soluble CO-releasing molecule, reduces
brain injury following hemorrhagic stroke [19].
A number of different cellular stressors induce HO-1 expression
via redox-sensitive transcription factors, including nuclear factor
erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) [20,21]. Nrf2 is a member of the
cap ‘n' collar family and is normally targeted for proteasomal
degradation via its cytosolic binding protein Kelch-like ECH
associated protein 1 (Keap1) [22–24]. Under conditions of oxidative, nitrosative or electrophilic stress Nrf2 accumulates in the
nucleus and together with small Maf proteins binds to antioxidant
response element (ARE) regions in the promoter of antioxidant
proteins such as HO-1 and Nrf2 itself [25,26].
HO-1 expression is induced in the brain of rats following hypoxia
and ischemia–reperfusion injury [27,28], yet little is known about
expression of Nrf2 and heme oxygenases in the gliovascular complex
of cerebral microvessels following stroke. Although there are limited
reports of HO-1 detection in blood vessels of the infarct region after
global cerebral ischemia in rats [29] and constitutive HO-2 expression in vessels of naïve brain [27], to our knowledge there are no
reported studies of the temporal or spatial distribution of Nrf2, HO-1,
and HO-2 between endothelial cells and perivascular astrocytes in
stroke.
In the present study, we used an experimental model of ischemic
stroke to monitor the time course of Nrf2 and HO-1 induction in core
and peri-infarct regions of stroke-affected and contralateral hemispheres of the rat brain after ischemia–reperfusion injury. HO-1 and
Nrf2 expression in the gliovascular complex of cerebral microvessels
was correlated with levels of nitrosative stress, BBB disruption, lesion
progression (MRI), and functional behavioral outcomes. Pretreatment
with sulforaphane, a dietary isothiocyanate and well-characterized
inducer of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression [30], upregulated antioxidant
defenses in the brain and signiﬁcantly attenuated functional and
behavioral deﬁcits after stroke.

reperfusion. For MRI studies, rats were pretreated with (viii)
sulforaphane (5 mg/kg ip) or (ix) vehicle (1 ml/kg ip, 1% corn oil
in saline) 1 h before MCAo with lesion volumes measured at 24
and 72 h reperfusion.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)
Cerebral ischemia was induced by transient intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) [31]. Rats were
anesthetized with isoﬂuorane (4% for induction, 2% for maintenance, mixture of 30% O2 and 70% nitrous oxide) throughout the
procedure. A permanent ligature was placed on the ipsilateral
common carotid to stop the ﬂow of blood into the internal carotid
artery. A silicone-coated ﬁlament (tip diameter 0.4 mm; Doccol)
was advanced 18–20 mm from the cervical carotid bifurcation
until reaching resistance from the ostium of the MCA in the circle
of Willis. The ﬁlament was then left in place for 70 min and, at the
end of the occlusion period, animals were checked for ﬂexion of
the contralateral forelimb, when lifted by their tail (Bederson's
test), and spontaneous asymmetric turning behavior when placed
on the ﬂoor, as signs of achieved MCAo [32]. All the animals
subjected to MCAo and included in our study were positive at this
test. Furthermore, we applied standard criteria of inclusion/exclusion of rats in this study [33]: (i) animals with no apparent lesion
observed on the MRI scan at 24 h following MCAo were excluded
from the study; (ii) animals that presented a subarachnoid
hemorrhage as detected by MRI at 24 h were also excluded from
the study. As MRI analysis was performed by another operator
than the one performing MCAo surgery and the pharmacological
interventions, exclusion criteria were applied in blind to treatment
allocation.
To allow reperfusion, rats were reanesthetized, the intraluminal
ﬁlament removed, and the wound was closed with non-absorbable
sutures. Sham-control animals underwent the same surgical procedure with temporary insertion of the thread but without occluding
the MCA.
Behavioral assessment
A global neurological scale [31] was used to assess a variety of
neurological functions, including spontaneous motility, righting
reﬂex, horizontal bar test, grasping reﬂex, tilted cage top, placing
reaction, and visual placing. An overall deﬁcit score was calculated
from these readouts, with each deﬁcit scoring 1 and successful
completion of the task scored zero.
Magnetic resonance imaging

Material and methods
All general consumables were purchased from Sigma, unless
otherwise stated.
Animals and experimental groups
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–330 g; Harlan) were used in
this study. All procedures were performed in accordance with the
UK Animal (Scientiﬁc Procedures) Act 1986 and rigorous ethical
review process both by the UK Home Ofﬁce and by King's College
London (Project Licence No. PPL70/6579).
Rats (n ¼46) were divided into the following experimental
groups: (i) naïve, (ii) sham-operated, or animals subjected to
70 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) followed by (iii)
4 h, (iv) 24 h, or (v) 72 h reperfusion, (vi) sulforaphane administration (5 mg/kg ip, dissolved in 1% corn oil in saline) to naïve
animals or (vii) 1 h before subsequent MCAo (70 min) and 24 h

H magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using a
7 T scanner (Agilent) in living rats under isoﬂurane anesthesia
(2.5% in mixture of 10% O2, 90% air). MR images were acquired in
8 min and 40 s using a T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence
(TR ¼4 s; effective TE ¼ 60 ms; averages¼ 4; number of slices ¼24;
slice thickness¼1 mm; in plane resolution ¼0.25  0.25 mm) [34].
Lesion volumes were measured using a semiautomated segmentation method, contouring the hyperintense areas in the ipsilateral
(stroke affected) hemisphere after 24 and 72 h reperfusion following MCAo using Jim software (Xinapse Systems).
Immunoﬂuorescence staining
At the end of behavioral testing, rats received an overdose of
pentobarbitone (120 mg/kg ip) and were perfused transcardially with
cold 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Fixed brains were left overnight in
PFA and then transferred to 30% sucrose. Coronal serial sections

(50 mm) were obtained using a cryostat (Leica) and placed on
microscope slides (VWR). Fluorescence staining was performed after
3 h blocking in 10% normal goat or normal donkey serum and cell
membrane permeabilization with Triton-X (0.3%), followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 1C. Sections were
incubated for 1 h at room temperature with ﬂuorescently tagged
secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit or donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 488
(1:1000; Invitrogen), goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-mouse Alexa
555 (1:1000; Invitrogen), or donkey anti-goat Cy5 (1:1000; Abcam).
Negative controls omitted the primary antibody (see Supplemental
Fig. 5A). Slides were then mounted with glass coverslips using
Vectashield (Vector) medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclear identiﬁcation.
Confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy
Confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal
laser scanning microscope. Alexa 488 was excited at 488 nm and
emission collected at 505–550 nm, Alexa 555 excited at 555 nm
and emission collected at 4560, and Cy5 excited at 633 nm and
emission collected at 4650 nm. Colocalization analysis of HO-1 or
HO-2 with brain cell markers was assessed by calculating the
Pearson's correlation coefﬁcient within a region of interest chosen
to encompass cerebral microvessels and using Zeiss LSM software [35].
Representative ﬂuorescence intensity proﬁles were obtained across
selected microvessels.
Analysis of HO-1 or HO-2 expression and cellular localization
Immunoﬂuorescence detection of HO-1 or HO-2 was performed
using rabbit anti-HO-1 (1:100; Abcam) or rabbit anti-HO-2 (1:100;
Stressgen) antibodies. Sections were colabeled for HO-1 or HO-2 and
the following brain cell markers: (i) rat endothelial cell antigen-1
(RECA-1; 1:100; Abcam) for endothelial cells, (ii) glial ﬁbrillary acidic
protein (GFAP; 1:100; Abcam) for astrocytes, and (iii) Iba1 (1:100;
Abcam) for microglia. HO-1 and HO-2 ﬂuorescence images were
captured using an Olympus UCMAD3 camera on an Olympus BX51
microscope and converted to 16-bit gray level images for off-line
quantitative analysis as previously described [36]. At least three
regions of interest (ROI) were averaged per measurement per section.

microscope (Nikon) and quantiﬁed with Image Hopper software
(Samsara Research).
We have previously measured initial rates of DAB-H2O2 polymer development to quantify total cellular Nrf2 levels and nuclear
to cytoplasmic ratios in rat brain sections subjected to MCAo
(70 min) and reperfusion injury for 4, 24, and 72 h [37]. Nuclear to
cytoplasmic Nrf2 ratios were quantiﬁed using the DAPI image of
nuclei and applying a binary mask to segment the Nrf2 image to
obtain nuclear Nrf2 content. By applying a binary mask of a 4 μm
wide ring around each nucleus (e.g., cytoplasm), total cellular Nrf2
content was determined from the weighted mean content of each
nucleus–cytoplasm pair and expressed as optical density increase
rate per 1000 s [37]. Similarly, images of immunoﬂuoresence for
RECA-1 and GFAP were used as masks to determine Nrf2 content
in cerebral microvessels, speciﬁcally in the endothelium and
surrounding astrocytic processes.
3-Nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity
Immunoﬂuorescence detection of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT; 1:100;
Abcam) was used to measure reactive oxygen species-mediated
nitration as a marker of peroxynitrite generation [38] and images
were converted to 16-bit gray level images for off-line analysis, as
previously described [36].
Analysis of brain injury and BBB disruption
Immunoﬂuorescence detection of glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein, as
a marker of brain injury [39], was performed using a polyclonal
rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (1:500; Dako). Positive staining for GFAP
was used to differentiate between peri-infarct and infarct core in the
ipsilateral stroke-affected hemisphere following transient MCAo, as
GFAP overexpression is lost in astrocytes within the infarcted areas.
Immunoﬂuorescence detection of tissue IgG was performed using
a red-orange ﬂuorescent cross-absorbed goat anti-rat Alexa 568 antibody (1:500; Invitrogen). Brain tissue areas positive for IgG were used
to determine the area affected by BBB breakdown [40], and data
expressed as percentage of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Furthermore,
ﬂuorescence images were converted to 8-bit gray level images for
quantitative measurement of leakage into the tissue.

Analysis of peroxiredoxin 1 expression in naive and sulforaphane
treated animals

Statistical analysis

Immunoﬂuorescence detection of peroxidredoxin 1 (Prx1) was
performed using rabbit anti-Prx1 (1:100, Abcam) and secondary antirabbit Alexaﬂuor 488 (1:500, Invitrogen) antibodies. Data for Prx1
expression in naive rats treated with vehicle (1% corn oil in saline) or
sulforaphane (5mg/kg ip) are summarized in Supplementary Fig. 5.

Data were analyzed using Graphpad Prism version 5.0. Data
from behavioral assessments are expressed as medians and were
analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis test
followed by Dunn's test for multiple comparisons. All other data
are expressed as mean 7 SEM and analyzed by Student's t test or
one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test for multiple
comparisons. A value of P o0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of Nrf2 expression
in cerebral microvessels

Results
Analysis of Nrf2 immunostaining associated with cerebral microvessels in ex vivo brain sections from naïve animals and rats subjected
to MCAo and reperfusion was conducted using our novel immunohistochemical technique [37], providing enhanced sensitivity compared to immunoﬂuorescence. Following blocking of endogenous
peroxidase activity and biotin, coronal sections (10 mm) were immunostained for Nrf2 using a polyclonal rabbit anti-Nrf2 primary antibody (16 h at 4 1C, 1:100; Abcam) and anti-rabbit biotinylated
secondary antibody, followed by incubation for 30 min with avidinbiotinylated horseradish peroxidase (HRP) complex (Vectastain ABC
kit; Vector) and application of a mixture of 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
(DAB; Vector) and hydrogen peroxide (0.3%). The initial rate of DABH2O2 polymer development over 20 min was captured on a Diaphot

Temporal and spatial induction of HO-1 after cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion
Ischemia–reperfusion induced substantial brain injury (Supplementary Fig. 1) and increased HO-1 protein expression in the
ipsilateral stroke-affected hemisphere (Fig. 1), whereas HO-1 immunoreactivity was low in the contralateral unaffected hemisphere, in
sham and naïve brains (data not shown). A zone of HO-1 induction
surrounding the infarct core was observed after 24 h reperfusion, as
highlighted by GFAP costaining, while after 72 h HO-1 was detected
in both peri-infarct and infarct core regions (Fig. 1A). Limited HO-1
induction was observed in the stroke hemisphere after 4 h reperfusion

(data not shown). Analysis of immunoﬂuorescence intensity (Fig. 1B)
conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant upregulation of HO-1 in peri-infarct regions at
4, 24, and 72 h after MCAo, noting that HO-1 immunostaining was
signiﬁcantly lower in the infarct core compared to the peri-infarct
region. As the pattern of HO-1 staining suggested a different cellular
distribution between peri-infarct and core regions, we further examined cellular localization of HO-1 using speciﬁc brain cell markers.
In the brain parenchyma, costaining of GFAP and Iba1
(Supplementary Fig. 2) showed that astrocytes in the peri-infarct
region expressed HO-1 after 4–72 h reperfusion, whereas after 72 h
reperfusion HO-1 was expressed predominantly in microglia within
the infarct core. Immunoreactivity for HO-2 was diffuse throughout
the brain, and no signiﬁcant differences in HO-2 expression were
detected between stroke-affected and unaffected regions after
24–72 h reperfusion (Supplementary Figs. 3A and B). Nevertheless,
HO-2 preferentially colocalized with perivascular astrocytes in the
stroke-affected hemisphere (Supplementary Figs. 3C and D).
Upregulation of HO-1 expression in cerebral microvessels of periinfarct regions after stroke
Cerebral microvessels (o10 mm diameter) showed a strong immunoreactivity for HO-1 in the peri-infarct region following stroke

(Fig. 2A). To examine the relative distribution of HO-1 in the
gliovascular complex, brain sections were costained with the cellspeciﬁc markers RECA-1 (endothelium) and GFAP (astrocytes).
By proﬁling immunoﬂuorescence intensities across cerebral microvessels, we found that peaks for HO-1 and GFAP intensities overlapped, with reduced overlap between HO-1 and RECA-1 (Fig. 2B). HO1 colocalization was signiﬁcantly higher with astrocytic processes
compared to endothelial cells after 4 and 24 h reperfusion (Fig. 2C).
After 72 h, HO-1 association with astrocytic processes remained
elevated, albeit HO-1 levels declined in both cell types, potentially
reﬂecting increased HO-1 expression in cells rolling and adhering to
the vessel wall from the bloodstream (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Nrf2 expression is increased in cerebral microvessels of peri-infarct
regions after stroke
Total Nrf2 levels in the gliovascular complex were elevated
signiﬁcantly after 4–24 h reperfusion, with Nrf2 expression declining after 72 h (Fig. 3A). Notably, increased Nrf2 levels were detected
in both perivascular astrocytes and the endothelium after 4 and 24 h
reperfusion, while after 72 h reperfusion Nrf2 expression remained
elevated only in perivascular astrocytic processes (Fig. 3B).

Temporal and spatial generation of peroxynitrite after cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion
Following ischemia–reperfusion, increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species leads to peroxynitrite formation
in cerebral microvessels [41], and we thus measured nitrotyrosine as a
marker of peroxynitrite generation and redox signaling in the cerebral
vasculature. We observed a signiﬁcant increase in 3-NT immunoreactivity in stroke-affected areas, with negligible staining detected in the
contralateral hemisphere, naïve and sham-control brains (Fig. 3C).
After 4 h reperfusion, levels of 3-NT in the infarct core were not
different from contralateral areas but signiﬁcantly lower than in periinfarct regions. 3-NT levels in both peri-infarct and core regions were
signiﬁcantly elevated after 24 and 72 h reperfusion.
Sulforaphane increases Nrf2, HO-1, and 3-NT expression in naïve
brains in vivo
As sulforaphane is a potent activator of Nrf2 [30], we treated
naïve animals with sulforaphane intraperitoneally and measured
Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. Sulforaphane led to a signiﬁcant increase
in total Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in the gliovascular complex of
cerebral microvessels after 24 h (Figs. 4A and B). As sulforaphane is

known to upregulate several other Nrf2-linked antioxidant genes
[30,42,43], we further examined Prx1 and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1, data not shown) protein expression in ex vivo
brain sections from naïve and sulforaphane-treated animals. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. 5, Prx1 expression was low in naïve
brains and signiﬁcantly increased in the brain parenchyma, including regions surrounding cerebral microvessels, 24 h after sulforaphane administration. NQO1 expression was also elevated, albeit
not signiﬁcantly, 24 h after sulforaphane treatment (data not
shown).
In a previous study, sulforaphane was shown to rapidly cross
the BBB in naïve mice, leading to an increase in Nrf2 expression
in the striatum and cortex 1–4 h after intraperitoneal injection
[43]. As several phytonutrients can activate the Nrf2 defense
pathway via the generation of low levels of reactive oxygen or
nitrogen species [44,45], we also measured levels of nitrotyrosine (3-NT). We found that 3-NT levels were signiﬁcantly
increased by sulforaphane (Fig. 4C), suggesting that a moderate
production of free radicals may underlie Nrf2 activation by this
phytonutrient. Thus, sulforaphane-mediated free radical generation and its ability to react with cysteine residues of Keap1
(including C151) [46] would lead to activation of the Nrf2
defense pathway.

Sulforaphane pretreatment potentiates stroke-induced antioxidant
defenses in peri-infarct regions

Sulforaphane pretreatment potentiates cerebrovascular expression
of HO-1 in stroke

We hypothesized that sulforaphane pretreatment may protect against stroke-induced damage via an increase in Nrf2mediated antioxidant defenses in areas of the brain at risk for
cell death but potentially salvageable. When we measured HO-1
induction in peri-infarct regions after MCAo, the total periinfarct area stained for HO-1 was low after 4 h reperfusion,
increased after 24 h, and then declined after 72 h reperfusion
(Fig. 5B), reﬂecting the time course of lesion progression after
stroke. Sulforaphane administration 1 h prior to MACo signiﬁcantly increased the area of HO-1 immunoreactivity in the periinfarct region after stroke (Figs. 5A and B). Moreover, pretreatment of rats with sulforaphane led to a modest but signiﬁcant
increase in 3-NT immunoreactivity in the peri-infarct region
following MCAo and 24 h reperfusion (Fig. 5C).

Besides peri-infarct regions, sulforaphane induced HO-1 speciﬁcally in cerebral microvessels of the infarct core (Fig. 6A). Proﬁling of
immunoﬂuorescence intensities across these microvessels established that peaks of HO-1 and RECA-1 intensity overlapped, with
limited overlap noted for HO-1 and GFAP (Fig. 6B). HO-1 colocalization was signiﬁcantly higher with RECA-1-positive endothelial cells
compared with astrocytic processes in the infarct core, while in the
peri-infarct region HO-1 remained predominantly associated with
astrocytes (Fig. 6C). Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that
Nrf2 was preferentially associated with astrocytic processes rather
than the endothelium in peri-infarct regions (Fig. 6D). However, in
the infarct core Nrf2 content was still enhanced in perivascular
astrocytes, although levels were signiﬁcantly lower compared with
those in the peri-infarct region.

Blood–brain barrier disruption after stroke is attenuated
by sulforaphane pretreatment
Consistent with enhanced antioxidant defenses in cerebral
microvessels, sulforaphane administration ameliorated BBB disruption. Macromolecular leak increased dramatically over 4–72 h
reperfusion, affecting about 70% of the stroke-affected hemisphere
after 24–72 h (Figs. 7A and B). As hypothesized, sulforaphane
signiﬁcantly reduced both the area and the amount of IgG leakage
after 24 h reperfusion (Figs. 7A and B).
Sulforaphane pretreatment reduces lesion progression and
neurological dysfunction
In animals pretreated with sulforaphane, MRI scanning
revealed that progression of lesion volumes (mm3) between 24
and 72 h reperfusion was signiﬁcantly reduced (33712 mm3)
compared with vehicle-treated (687 25 mm3) animals (Fig. 8A).
Neurological dysfunction after MCAo was characterized by
impaired motility, grasping reﬂex, and placing reaction. Negligible
deﬁcits were observed after 4 h reperfusion, whereas reperfusion for
24 and 72 h induced marked neurological deﬁcits (Fig. 8B). Notably,
neurological deﬁcits were signiﬁcantly attenuated in animals pretreated with sulforaphane before MCAo and 24 h reperfusion (Fig. 8B).

Discussion
In this study, we report the ﬁrst temporal and spatial distribution
of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the gliovascular complex of cerebral microvessels following ischemic stroke, and demonstrate that preactivation of the Nrf2 pathway in perivascular astrocytes and brain
endothelium before stroke with sulforaphane signiﬁcantly ameliorates BBB disruption, lesion progression, and neurological

dysfunction. We further established that induction of Nrf2 and
HO-1 in the brain is associated with moderate peroxynitrite generation, suggesting that “preconditioning” by sulforaphane via free
peroxynitrite production (Fig. 4C) and its reactions with Keap1
cysteine residues [46] may underlie sulforaphane-mediated protection in stroke.
HO-1 induction has been reported previously in the rat brain
following transient focal ischemia [27,47]; however, the time
course and gliovascular distribution of this cytoprotective enzyme,
known to generate chain breaking lipid antioxidant bilirubin from
biliverdin, has not been investigated. In our study, HO-1 was
induced markedly in the periphery after 4 and 24 h, delimiting
the peri-infarct region, while after 72 h induction of HO-1 was
detected in both infarct core and peri-infarct regions. In the brain
parenchyma, HO-1 immunoreactivity was predominantly associated with astrocytes in the peri-infarct region but with microglia
in the infarct core. Due to the close proximity of perivascular
astrocytic processes and cerebrovascular endothelium constituting
the BBB, we employed confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy
to identify cell types in the gliovascular unit expressing HO-1, and
here report the ﬁrst evidence that HO-1 induction in stroke is
predominantly associated with perivascular astrocytes rather than
the endothelium. Notably, previous studies of naïve rat brain [48]
or spinal cord [49] did not discriminate HO-1 levels in astrocytic
processes and endothelial cells, and thus our ﬁndings clarify the
distribution of HO-1 in cerebral microvessels following focal
ischemia–reperfusion. Importantly, we did not detect any change
in the levels of constitutive HO-2 following transient MCAo,
conﬁrming that the two HO isoforms may not be modulated by
the same stressors [50]. Although previous studies investigated
the functional role of HO-2 in cerebral microvessels in vivo and
in vitro [50,51], the speciﬁc cell type expressing HO-2 was not
examined. We found that expression in cerebral microvessels was
associated primarily with astrocytic processes, conﬁrming that

perivascular astrocytes exhibit strong antioxidant defenses [52]
and may play a primary role in protecting the gliovascular unit
against oxidative stress in stroke.
Activation of Nrf2 in astrocytes in response to a variety of
insults, e.g., oxidative stress and ischemia, affords neuroprotection through induction of ARE-related genes [53]; hence,
we hypothesized that cerebrovascular expression of HO-1 in
stroke is related to Nrf2 activation. We demonstrate that Nrf2

is upregulated in microvessels of the peri-infarct region as
early as 4 h after MCAo, with expression detected in both
astrocytic processes and the endothelium, suggesting that
activation of Nrf2 and induction of HO-1 are part of the same
endogenous mechanism protecting the brain against stroke.
Although protein expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in rat brain
homogenates and sections has been reported to be increased
3–24 h after ischemia [28,54], to our knowledge our study is

the ﬁrst to quantify temporal and spatial activation of Nrf2 in
cerebral microvessels.
In view of the importance of the Nrf2 defense pathway in
neuroprotection [55–57], we examined the possibility of preventing
stroke-induced damage with sulforaphane, a well-characterized
activator of the Nrf2 pathway in different tissues including the brain
[30,58]. Sulforaphane increases HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in
neurons and astrocytes after 24 h [59] and after 18–24 h in isolated
brain microvessels of uninjured rats [60]; however, these studies did
not examine sulforaphane-induced HO-1 and Nrf2 expression in
cerebral microvessels following brain injury.
We report signiﬁcant increases in Nrf2, HO-1, and Prx1 (see
Supplementary Fig. 5) immunoreactivity in naïve rats 24 h after
sulforaphane administration. Although perivascular astrocytes accounted predominantly for HO-1 expression in the gliovascular complex
within the peri-infarct region, HO-1 expression was detected in the
endothelium of microvessels within the infarct core of the stroke
hemisphere after sulforaphane pretreatment. Nrf2 expression was
elevated in perivascular astrocytes compared with the endothelium
in both regions, and levels in astrocytes were lower in the peri-infarct
region compared with the infarct core, possibly reﬂecting dysfunction
of astrocytes following ischemia. As a result of cell injury, astrocytes
within the lesion area lose GFAP immunoreactivity, whereas GFAP
expression is maintained and upregulated in surviving astrocytes [61].
Furthermore, astrocytes are the ﬁrst cell type to swell within 5 min
following an ischemic event [62] and undergo necrosis after 24 h,
while endothelial cells start swelling after 2 h and undergo necrosis

after 12 h [63]. Therefore, we propose that functionally active, GFAPexpressing astrocytes upregulate HO-1 levels in the peri-infarct region
after stroke, a process enhanced by sulforaphane, while endothelial
cells in the infarct core express HO-1 defenses in the absence of
normal astrocytic function. Consistent with our ﬁnding that the
cerebral microvasculature exhibits enhanced HO-1 induction after
sulforaphane administration, BBB disruption, lesion progression, and
neurological dysfunction after stroke were ameliorated, highlighting
the importance of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defenses in protection of
the BBB.
We suggest that sulforaphane, in addition to its reported
interactions with Keap1 cysteine residues [46], may also upregulate
antioxidant defenses by preconditioning the brain via low hormetic
levels of oxidative or nitrosative stress, a mechanism shared by
several dietary phytonutrients [45]. Notably, preconditioning of
endogenous antioxidant defenses involving HO-1 and heat shock
proteins have been implicated in the beneﬁcial effects of dietary
phytochemicals against neurodegeneration [64,65]. As several studies implicate peroxynitrite in neurovascular preconditioning following cerebral ischemia [38], we examined levels of nitrotyrosine
(3-NT) as a marker of protein nitration. Although disruption of the
Nrf2-Keap1 complex via electrophilic interactions with sulfhydryl
residues of Keap1 is the mechanism most commonly invoked to
explain sulforaphane-induced activation of Nrf2, other mechanisms
have also been suggested, including generation of reactive oxygen
species and protein phosphorylation [52]. Notably, sulforaphane
generates reactive oxygen species intracellularly [66], which in turn
may activate Nrf2. We found that sulforaphane induced a modest
increase in 3-NT levels in naïve brains and in peri-infarct regions
following transient MCAo. Thus, our ﬁndings support the hypothesis of an hormetic property of sulforaphane, wherby a moderate
rise in oxidative stress may induce brain tolerance against oxidative
damage in stroke via Nrf2 activation.
Previous studies have established that sulforaphane treatment
protects astrocytes [67], mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts [68], and retinal
pigment epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and leukemia cells [69] against
oxidative and/or electrophilic stress via Nrf2-mediated antioxidant gene expression. Thus, as envisaged by Higgins et al. [68], low,
physiologically relevant concentrations of sulforaphane lead to preconditioning by which a therapeutic drug protects against subsequent
oxidative stress. Notably, repeated, transient stimulation of astrocytes
with sulforaphane results in a prolonged upregulation of endogenous
antioxidant enzymes and protection against oxidative stress [67].
Furthermore, treatment of rats with sulforaphane increases Nrf2mediated antioxidant defenses in liver [70] and brain [71] mitochondria, increasing their resistance to peroxide-induced opening of the
permeability transition pore (PTP) 40 h after sulforaphane adminstration in vivo. Thus, preconditioning of the brain with sulforaphane could
contribute to protection of mitochondria associated with the neurovascular unit in stroke.

Conclusions
Due to the pivotal role played by oxidative stress in the early
phases following cerebral ischemia, antioxidants have been widely
regarded as protective agents against stroke [72]. Nevertheless,
experimental and clinical studies have provided conﬂicting results
on the efﬁcacy of antioxidants, e.g., vitamins and ROS scavengers, to
prevent stroke incidence or mortality [73]. Importantly, exogenous
antioxidants and ROS scavengers may inhibit physiological redox
signaling pathways and the activation of endogenous antioxidant
responses [74]. We found that the Nrf2/HO-1 defense pathway is
activated during the early time course following ischemic stroke in a
reperfusion-dependent and cell-speciﬁc manner, and that preactivation of this pathway with sulforaphane is associated with moderate

A. Alﬁeri et al. / Free Radical Biology and Medicine 65 (2013) 1012–1022

peroxynitrite generation, protecting against stroke-induced BBB
disruption and neurological deﬁcits. Protection of brain against
ischemic stroke by sulforphane pretreatment is consistent with
recent evidence that dietary phytonutrients can attenuate or reverse
inﬂammatory responses associated with brain injury [64].
We propose that pharmacological or dietary interventions with the
isothiocyanate sulforaphane may enhance redox-sensitive defenses
in the brain and thereby limit lesion volumes and neurological
deﬁcits after stroke. In conclusion, our study provides evidence for
the therapeutic potential of targeting the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in the
cerebral microvessels with sulforaphane to prevent BBB disruption
and brain injury after ischemic stroke.
