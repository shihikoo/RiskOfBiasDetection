ABSTRACT

INTRODUCTION

To evaluate the effect of bevacizumab on cerebral
ischemia, we used 2-deoxy-2-18F-fluoro-D-glucose
(18F-FDG) small-animal positron emission tomography
(PET) in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
rat model. After baseline neurologic function tests and
PET studies, MCAO Sprague-Dawley rats received
bevacizumab or normal saline (controls). Weekly PET
imaging and neurologic function tests showed that the
18
F-FDG accumulation in the bevacizumab group was
similar to that in the controls during the first 2 weeks, but
lower than in controls at weeks 3 and 4. However, no
difference was found in neurological scores between the
groups. The number of von Willebrand factor-positive
cells in the bevacizumab group was lower than that in
controls. The expression of vascular endothelial growth
factor was higher than in controls at week 4. These
results suggested that bevacizumab does not influence
functional recovery in this model of cerebral ischemia
during a 4-week period, but inhibits vascular formation
and metabolic recovery, which may be considered in
cancer patients with a recent ischemic stroke.

Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and cancer are the top two

causes of morbidity and mortality in aging populations[1-3].
Studies have shown that CVD is typically associated with
ischemic stroke [4]. Ischemic stroke featuring functional
disturbance and morphological damage of brain is caused
by CVD, which affects the brain blood supply and leads to
a cascade of metabolic alterations. Clinical presentation
of CVD in cancer patients is common: 14.6% of such
patients have pathologic evidence of CVD, and 7.4% show
clinical symptoms[5]. Although current therapeutic strategies
improve the survival rate and extend the lifetime of cancer
patients, increased risk of ischemic stroke is frequently
observed in the same individuals[6]. Therefore, exploring the
therapeutic strategies for recent ischemic stroke in cancer
patients is a serious challenge.
Currently, anti-angiogenic therapy is widely used
in the treatment of various solid cancers. Increasingly,
angiogenesis-targeting therapies have been developed
by manipulating the vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) signaling pathway. Bevacizumab (Avastin,
Genentech/Roche, Basel, Switzerland), a recombinant
humanized monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A, is the
first anti-angiogenic drug approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (USA)[7] for metastatic colorectal cancer[8],

has a strong effect on decreasing the number of vessels,
consistent with a previous study[32]. However, other cancer
studies [33-34] differ from ours, in that bevacizumab was
reported to reduce the high expression of VEGF. We
consider that this might be due to the much lower level of

a tumor. In a recent study on candesartan, a drug currently
used to treat hypertension, VEGF expression was found to
significantly increase at 2 weeks after MCAO compared to
