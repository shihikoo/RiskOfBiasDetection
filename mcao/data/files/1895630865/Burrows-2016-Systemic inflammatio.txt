Reperfusion after stroke is critical for improved patient survival and recovery and can be achieved clinically
through pharmacological (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) or physical (endovascular intervention)
means. Yet these approaches remain conﬁned to a small percentage of stroke patients, often with incomplete reperfusion, and therefore there is an urgent need to learn more about the mechanisms underlying the no-reﬂow
phenomenon that prevents restoration of adequate microvascular perfusion. Recent evidence suggests systemic
inﬂammation as an important contributor to no-reﬂow and to further investigate this here we inject interleukin 1
(IL-1) i.p. 30 min prior to an ischaemic challenge using a remote ﬁlament to occlude the middle cerebral artery
(MCA) in mice. Before, during and after the injection of IL-1 and occlusion we use two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy to record the spatial and temporal dynamics of oxyhaemoglobin concentration in the cortical
areas supplied by the MCA. Our results reveal that systemic inﬂammation signiﬁcantly reduces oxyhaemoglobin
reperfusion as early as 3 h after ﬁlament removal compared to vehicle injected animals. CD41 immunohistochemistry shows a signiﬁcant increase of hyper-coagulated platelets within the microvessels in the stroked
cortex of the IL-1 group compared to vehicle. We also observed an increase of pathophysiological biomarkers
of ischaemic damage including elevated microglial activation co-localized with interleukin 1α (IL-1α), increased
blood brain barrier breakdown as shown by IgG inﬁltration and increased pyknotic morphological changes of
cresyl violet stained neurons. These data conﬁrm systemic inﬂammation as an underlying cause of no-reﬂow
in the post-ischaemic brain and that appropriate anti-inﬂammatory approaches could be beneﬁcial in treating
ischaemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality with
treatment options limited to reperfusion through thrombolysis or
thrombectomy. Ischaemic stroke accounts for 85% of all human strokes
and is mainly caused by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), a
major arterial branch supplying blood to the brain (Doyle et al., 2008,
Lloyd, 2010; Rosamond, et al., 2008). The resulting occlusion results in
hypoperfusion of brain tissue creating an energy depleted state within
the infarct core, triggering acute pathophysiological processes which
result in neuronal injury (Ankolekar et al., 2012, Cramer et al., 2003,
Semenza, 2009). Hypoperfusion starves tissue of glucose resulting in
neuronal dysfunction and release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
(Mori et al., 1992, Vila et al., 2000). Future successful treatment of
ischaemic stroke requires a comprehensive understanding of the
pathophysiological changes that occur within the acute phase of cerebral
ischaemia.

Despite promising results in experimental studies of stroke in animal
models there has been a lack of translation to clinical success (Ankolekar
et al., 2012, Denes et al., 2010a, 2010b). Pre-clinical studies of ischaemic
stroke to date have largely failed to take into account relevant
co-morbidities for stroke, which experimentally we have shown can
dramatically exacerbate ischaemic injury (Denes et al., 2010a, 2010b,
McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b, McColl, 2008). A key hallmark of stroke
co-morbidities is systemic inﬂammation and it is now well accepted
that inﬂammatory processes are a major contributor to cerebral ischaemia (Denes et al., 2010a, 2010b, McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b, McColl,
2009; McColl, 2008; McColl et al., 2010; Maysami et al., 2015). The proinﬂammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) in particular has been identiﬁed as a key mediator of neuronal injury. Experimental models of stroke
have found that IL-1 signalling on endothelial cells, microglia, astrocytes
and neutrophils stabilizes mRNA for pro-inﬂammatory mediator expression (Brandolini et al., 1997, Ericsson et al., 1995). Furthermore IL-1 acts
on cerebral microvasculature endothelial cells, upregulating adhesion
molecule expression and subsequent neutrophil transmigration
(Brandolini et al., 1997). IL-1 has also been shown as the main driver in
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mediated worsening of damage (Denes et al.,
2010a, 2010b, McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b). Recent ﬁndings demonstrate

that systemic IL-1 prevents microvascular reperfusion post-stroke
through endothelin-dependent mechanisms (Murray et al., 2013). Furthermore we have previously shown that preceding pneumonia infection worsens stroke outcome via IL-1 and platelet dependent
mechanisms (Denes et al., 2014). Patients with underlying
inﬂammation-related co-morbidities for stroke, including obesity, diabetes, arthritis and smoking often have worse outcomes following a cerebral ischaemic event (Bottcher and Falk, 1999; Herz et al., 2015, Pinto
et al., 2004). In human trials IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) limits
the action of IL-1, improving patient outcome by reducing the pathophysiological activity including reduction in neutrophil numbers
(Emsley, et al., 2005; Emsley et al., 2008, Smith et al., 2004). Therefore
we have identiﬁed IL-1 as a very relevant cytokine to co-administer
with cerebral ischaemia. Despite these data supporting a key role of IL1 in ischaemic brain injury it remains to be fully deﬁned how IL-1 affects
reperfusion post-stroke. To investigate this further we combine systemic
administration of IL-1 with a remote ﬁlament model of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAo) (Burrows et al., 2015), using two-dimensional
optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS), to conﬁrm the effects of IL-1 on
cortical oxyhaemoglobin dynamics during reperfusion after stroke in
mice.
2. Methods
2.1. Animals
All animal procedures were performed under an appropriate Home
Ofﬁce Licence and adhered to regulations as speciﬁed in the Animals
(Scientiﬁc Procedures) Act (1986). Studies were performed in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines, with appropriate randomisation and
blinding procedures in place, and ethical approval by the local ethics
committee of the University of Manchester. Mice were kept at 21 °C
and 65% humidity with a regulated 12-h light–dark cycle and free access
to food and water. Twenty-nine male C57/BL6 mice (Harlan Laboratories, UK) weighing between 30 and 36 g (age 18 to 25 weeks) were
used in this study. Ten C57/BL6 male mice underwent i.p. injection of
20 ng/kg mouse recombinant IL-1β (R&D systems, UK) in sterile PBS
and 0.5% low endotoxin BSA, 30 min prior to a 30 min MCAo with 6 h
reperfusion; the remaining ten mice underwent i.p. injection of sterile
PBS with 0.5% low endotoxin BSA alone (vehicle), 30 min prior to a
30 min ischaemic insult with 6 h reperfusion. In addition four C57/BL6
mice underwent the IL-1 protocol and ﬁve C57/BL6 mice underwent
the vehicle protocol but were sacriﬁced 10 min after removal of the
MCAo ﬁlament (i.e. 70 min after injection) for further immunohistochemical analysis. Though IL-1β was injected in the interest of brevity
the rest of the manuscript will simply refer to IL-1.
2.2. Remote ﬁlaments
Filament preparation was performed as described in (Burrows et al.,
2015) producing 5 cm remote ﬁlaments with a Xantopren M Mucosa
and Activator NF Optosil (Heraeus, GER) mix for tip coating, ﬁrst
described by (Engel et al., 2011). A 2 cm length of clear i.v. catheter
tubing (Portex, Kent UK) was used to aid stability during insertion of
the ﬁlament.
2.3. Surgical preparation
Anaesthesia was induced with 4% isoﬂurane (Abbott, Berkshire, UK)
in room air. Once the animals were unconscious with lack of pedal
reﬂex, they were maintained under 2% isoﬂurane via a face mask for
surgery and, once a tracheal cannula had been inserted, 1% to 1.5%
isoﬂurane for the remainder of the experiment. MCAo was performed
by advancing the custom made ﬁlament through the external carotid
artery (ECA) up to the internal carotid artery to a point just before the
MCA branch (Burrows et al., 2015). For imaging experiments, animals

253

were ﬁxed in a stereotactic frame (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) with ear
bars, mouth bar and a dorsal head post to prevent movement. Animals
were artiﬁcially ventilated with 1% to 1.5% isoﬂurane in room air via
a Zoovent Jetsys ventilator (Universal Lung Ventilators Ltd., Milton
Keynes, UK). Body temperature was maintained at 37.5 °C via a heating
blanket controlled with a rectal probe (Harvard Apparatus, Kent, UK),
and the heart rate was monitored via ECG throughout the experiment.
The scalp was dissected down the midline to expose the skull. The
bone over the area of the somatosensory cortex supplied by the MCA
in the stroked hemisphere was kept translucent with a saline ﬁlled
parafﬁn well closed by a circular cover slip.
2.4. Two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy
Two-dimensional spectroscopic imaging data were collected
through the imaging window over the intact skull using a high signalto-noise charged coupled device (CCD) camera (Pantera 1M30, DALSA,
Munich, Germany). The region of interest was illuminated sequentially
by four different wavelengths of light (550 ± 10 nm, 560 ± 10 nm,
577 ± 10 nm, and 700 ± 10 nm) using a Lambda DG-4 high-speed ﬁlter
changer (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA, USA). Camera data collection
was synchronized with the ﬁlter changer so that each image frame
was recorded with one of the four different cortical illumination wavelengths in a sequential manner at a rate of 28 Hz. A ceramic attenuator
(PI Instruments, Bedford, UK) was attached to a single whisker on the
right whisker pad to enable computer-controlled mechanical stimulation of the barrel cortex throughout the experiment. A single imaging
experiment consisted of a continuous recording of 30 trials. Each trial
was 16 s long and contained a 4-s pre-stimulus period; 4 s of 8 Hz
mechanical whisker stimulation and an 8-s recovery time. These 8-min
experiments were recorded before injection, post injection, during, and
after MCAo for both experimental groups as shown in Fig. 1.
2.5. Imaging protocol
A region of interest (ROI) for imaging was chosen to include the
main branches of the MCA and the barrel cortex as identiﬁed by
localized functional activity from mechanical whisker stimulation.
Three sets of trials were recorded for baseline comparison after
which the animals underwent i.p. injection with 20 ng/kg IL-1β or vehicle treatment (Fig. 1). Post injection of IL-1β or vehicle, a further
three sets of trials were recorded during the 30 min prior to ﬁlament
advancement. Then the remote ﬁlament was advanced ~2 to 4 mm to
induce a 30 min occlusion of the MCA. During the MCAo three further
trials were recorded. The remote ﬁlament was then retracted
back 6 mm to allow full reperfusion of the MCA. Trials were then recorded every 30 min for 6 h after reperfusion. After 6 h reperfusion,
the animal was transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline solution
containing 0.5% sodium nitrate followed by 2% paraformaldehyde
solution. After ﬁxing, the brain was removed, stored in 2% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and submerged in a 30% sucrose solution for a
further 24 h.
2.6. Tissue processing
Coronal brain sections (30 μm thick) were cut on a sledge microtome
(Leica, Milton Keynes, UK) with freezing stage (Bright Instruments,
Huntingdon, UK). Sections were stored in antifreeze solution (30%
ethylene glycol and 20% glycerol (Sigma, Gillingham, UK) in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS)) at −20 °C, before histological staining.
2.7. Immunohistochemistry
Brain sections were pre-mounted on charged slides (Fisher Scientific, USA) before antigen-retrieval, where slides were submerged in
citrate buffer (Invitrogen) diluted 1:100 in distilled water or 10%

methanol (Fisher, Loughborough, UK) with 3% H2O2 (Sigma, UK) in PBS
containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for IL-1 staining. A 1 h blocking
step was performed using 2% of normal donkey or rabbit serum (Vector
Labs, Peterborough, UK) in primary diluent (PBS containing 0.3% Triton
X-100; Sigma) or 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) with 5% normal
rabbit serum (Vector Labs, UK) for IL-1 staining. Sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies as follows: mouse monoclonal
anti-CD41/integrin alpha 2b antibody (platelets) (1:100, BD, NJ, USA),

rabbit anti-Iba-1 (microglia) (1:1000, Abcam) and an immuno doublestain of rabbit anti-Iba-1 (microglia) (1:1000, Abcam) with goat antiIL-1α (IL-1α co-localisation) (1:100 R&D Systems, USA), primary goat
anti-mouse IL-1β IgG antibody (1:500, R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA). Sections were further incubated with secondary antibodies
conjugated to Alexa 488 nm or Alexa 594 nm ﬂuorochromes (1:500,
Invitrogen, UK) for 2 h at room temperature or biotinylated rabbit
anti-goat antibody (1:500, Vector Labs) for 2 h followed by nickel

Fig. 2. μmolar change in oxyhaemoglobin concentration. The ﬁrst two columns show typical ΔHbO2 maps for an animal from the vehicle and IL-1 injected groups. The sudden drop in HbO2
during occlusion gives instant feedback that a successful occlusion has been initiated. On ﬁlament retraction we see an increase in HbO2 concentration in both groups. 180 min after
removing the occlusion we start to see a decrease of the initial HbO2 reperfusion levels for most animals in the vehicle injected group. However the IL-1 injected group shows a
signiﬁcantly worse decrease in HbO2. At 360 min post ﬁlament removal we have a continued decrease in ΔHbO2 in the vehicle injected group often to levels below those during the
ischaemic event. This late reperfusion deﬁcit is even worse in IL-1 injected animals. The third column shows the masks drawn to exclude major vessels from quantitative analysis,
leaving only the parenchyma to be quantiﬁed and correlated with post-experiment histological processing. The ﬁnal column represents the μm colour scale. Scale bar = 1 mm, arrow
points rostral.

ammonia diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining procedure (for further details see (Brown et al., 2004, Burrows et al., 2015, Lu and Partridge,
1998; Nielsen et al., 1987) for IL-1 staining. A ﬁnal wash was performed
in PBS before application of Prolong Gold antifade reagent (with or
without DAPI; Invitrogen, USA) used as the mounting medium for
glass coverslips or DPX mounting medium (Agar Scientiﬁc, Stansted,
UK). Images for analysis were captured using an Olympus wideﬁeld
BX51 upright microscope with ﬁlter sets matching the ﬂuorescence
markers. Equivalent areas of the cerebral cortex at the same magniﬁcation (×20) were imaged across both groups for each speciﬁc marker.
Structural images for CD41 platelets and Iba-1 changes were collected on a Leica TCS SP5 AOBS upright confocal microscope. When it was
not possible to eliminate cross-talk between channels, the images
were collected sequentially. The maximum intensity projections of
these 3D stacks are shown in the results. Images were taken at × 40
magniﬁcation. IL-1 IHC staining was captured using a brightﬁeld
Olympus S2X9 microscope to gain full-slice images.
IgG immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the leakage of
endogenous IgG into the brain parenchyma as a measure of BBB breakdown. Sections were washed with PBS followed by incubation with a
second blocking agent, consisting of 5% normal horse serum (Vector
Labs) and 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.3% Triton-X100 (Sigma) was applied for 1 h. Sections were incubated with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500, Vector Labs). DAB staining
protocol, as described above, was performed prior to coverslipping
with DPX mounting medium.
Cresyl Violet (CV) stained brain sections were mounted on gelatinized
slides and initially soaked in alcohol of increasing concentrations 50%,
70%, 90%, and 100% followed by descending order (4 min each concentration) to remove lipids and ﬁxation chemicals from the tissue. Sections were then submerged with 1.5% CV staining solution. Ultraclear
(4 min) was used as a clearing agent, making unstained parts of the
tissue transparent followed by coverslipping with DPX mounting
medium.

increase and with green colours indicating little change compared with
the reference time point (Fig. 2). For statistical evaluation, the mean
pixel values of the regions outside the masks of ΔHbO2 maps were calculated. Due to a slight variability of carrying out the complex experiment,
the timing within the groups for the data acquisition during early reperfusion ranged from 8 to 12 min after block removal and later reperfusion
ranged from 350 to 360 min. The timing of baseline recordings and recordings during occlusion was precise up to the minute (Fig. 2).
2.10. Statistical analysis
Animals were randomized for experiments and quantitative analyses were double-blinded across all groups; vehicle group n = 10, IL1β group n = 10. Past experience and review of referenced publications
(Denes et al., 2010a, 2010b, McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b) have shown
that a group size of 10 provides reasonable assurance of statistical
power for this type of study. One-way ANOVA was used to compare
mean HbO2 concentration change in μmolar values outside the masked
regions in the imaging data and to compare between the two groups for
the immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence marker staining,
coupled with Bonferroni multiple comparison test in histology data to
indicate differences between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, calculated and displayed as mean values with error (±)
displayed by standard deviation. The nine animals that were sacriﬁced
70 min after injection were analysed separately and not compared to
the animals that had undergone 6 h reperfusion.
3. Results
3.1. IL-1 treatment increases reperfusion deﬁcit
In order to establish that the i.p. injections themselves do not cause a
change of the HbO2 concentrations, we compared recordings before and
after the injection. Baseline recordings from the two experimental
groups show non-signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations between trials recorded preinjection (IL-1 or vehicle) and post-injection (ΔHbO2 4.35 ± 1.25 μmol

2.8.1. Immunohistochemistry
Images of the cerebral cortex were collected from ﬁve evenly spaced
sections spanning the somatosensory cortex from both hemispheres for
comparison. IgG and IL-1β were quantiﬁed by measuring the mean grey
value (pixel density) of each hemisphere, the value of which was
subtracted from the absolute white value (max), and comparing interhemispheric values. Activated microglial (Iba-1) and platelet cells
(CD41) were double-blinded to eliminate bias and then counted manually and in each hemisphere in a 0.46 × 0.34 mm size region of the
somatosensory cortex. CV cells for cortex counts were centred on
layer IV with a 0.3 × 0.3 mm region of interest for all animals.
2.9. Calculation of oxyhaemoglobin concentration
Changes in oxyhaemoglobin concentrations were calculated
by spectroscopic analysis with a pathlength scaling Beer Lambert
algorithm (Berwick et al., 2005) between the sets of four wavelengths
at different time points within the experiment. Baseline variability in
cortical HbO2 levels was deduced from comparison of an image set recorded before injection with an image set recorded after injection but
before occlusion. To establish the extent of the decrease in HbO2 during
occlusion, we compared the set before occlusion (but after injection)
with those at the end of the 30 min occlusion. Once these maps were
created, we produced a single mask for each animal to exclude the
large arteries and veins from further analysis. This approach allowed
the calculation of μmolar changes in ΔHbO2 concentration in the area of
microvascular perfusion of the parenchyma before, during and after occlusion, as well as comparisons between groups. For the visualization of
ΔHbO2 we created a μmol colour scale, with blue for a decrease, red an

Fig. 3. Changes in oxyhaemoglobin. Little variation is observed between the two groups
before occlusion for oxyhaemoglobin concentration; 4.35 ± 1.25 μmol IL-1, 5.44 ±
1.52 μmol VEH. Both groups display a signiﬁcant decrease in HbO2 during 30 min MCAo;
− 24.99 ± 4.71 μmol IL-1, − 32.01 ± 6.64 μmol VEH. All following changes are
calculated with respect to the HbO2 value at the end of the occlusion. Initially both
groups show an increase in HbO2 upon reperfusion; 15.24 ± 6.9 μmol IL-1, 13.63 ±
8.76 μmol VEH. After 180 min of reperfusion (middle reperfusion time point) the IL-1
group HbO2 has signiﬁcantly decreased (−2.85 ± 10.73 μmol) P b 0.05, compared to
the vehicle-injected group (19.06 ± 28.36 μmol). By late reperfusion the HbO2 deﬁcit
within the IL-1 injected group is more pronounced (− 25.32 ± 8.2 μmol) P b 0.01
compared to the vehicle-injected group (5.64 ± 20.08 μmol) at the same time point.

for the IL-1 injected group and 5.44 ± 1.52 μmol for the vehicle injected
group) (Fig. 3).
On MCA occlusion there was a 5-to-6-fold decrease in ΔHbO2 in the
IL-1 and vehicle injected groups within the stroked hemisphere, with no
signiﬁcant difference between the two treatments (Fig. 3). After 30 min
of occlusion, when the ﬁlament was retracted, there is an instant
1.6-fold and a 2.3-fold increase in oxyhaemoglobin respectively. ΔHbO2
levels rose to 15.24 ± 6.9 μmol for the IL-1 injected group and 13.63 ±
8.76 for the vehicle injected group. These values display a nonsigniﬁcant variation between the two groups.
At middle reperfusion (180 min) following ﬁlament retraction a gradual but signiﬁcant decline of ΔHbO2 within the brain parenchyma of the
IL-1 compared to the vehicle injected group was observed. ΔHbO2 levels
decreased 1.3-fold to −2.85 ± 10.73 μmol (P b 0.05) for the IL-1 injected
group compared to a 0.2-fold decrease to 19.06 ± 28.36 μmol for the vehicle injected group (Fig. 3). At late reperfusion (360 min) following ﬁlament retraction a continued decline of ΔHbO2 within the brain
parenchyma of the IL-1β compared to the vehicle injected group was

observed, ΔHbO2 levels decreased 1.6-fold to −25.32 ± 8.20 μmol
(P b 0.01) for the IL-1 injected group compared to a 3-fold increase to
5.64 ± 30.08 μmol for the vehicle injected group, relative to level at the
end of the MCAo (Fig. 3).
3.2. Increase in biomarkers of ischaemic damage after IL-1 treatment
Hyper-coagulated platelets were observed within the cerebral microvasculature of the stroked hemisphere in IL-1 injected mice compared to
vehicle injected (Fig. 4). Platelet clusters were determined by size; small
clusters ranged b 10 μm2, medium clusters 10–30 μm2 and hypercoagulated clusters N30 μm2, based on the work of (Murray et al.,
2013). Systemic injection of IL-1 coupled with 30 min MCAo induced a
48.1% increase of platelet aggregates b10 μm2 (P b 0.01) as well as a
34.3% increase in aggregates N30 μm2 (P b 0.001) within the stroked cerebral cortex compared to the same region within the vehicle injected
group (Fig. 4). Morphological changes in platelet aggregation were apparent between the two groups with the IL-1 injected mice displaying large

aggregates which ﬁll the diameter and length of larger microvessels. The
aggregates themselves appear to show cellular clusters, which could indicate platelet:leukocyte interactions (Fig. 4 (I + II)).
In order to investigate that these platelet aggregates do not appear
early before any reperfusion delay we processed the brain tissue that
was perfused 70 min after IL-1 (n = 4) or vehicle (n = 5) injection in
the same manner. The mean count for any of the three platelet cluster
sizes in both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of both groups
was b3 demonstrating the absence of an early aggregation (Fig. 5).
In order to determine BBB breakdown leakage of systemic protein
IgG into the stroked brain hemisphere was quantiﬁed. IgG was localized
mainly to the ipsilateral hemisphere and was elevated by 35.3%
(P b 0.05) with IL-1 treatment when compared with the vehicle injected
group (Fig. 6) Systemic IL-1 injection also increased the number of
activated Iba-1 + microglia within the stroked 39.2% (P b 0.001) and
contralateral 58.5% (P b 0.001) cerebral cortex compared to the equivalent regions within the vehicle injected group (Fig. 6B). Microglia were
considered ‘activated’ upon identiﬁcation of a bushy rod or amoeboid
morphological appearance (Fig. 6B (II + III)).
IL-1α co-localized to Iba-1 stained microglia was not signiﬁcantly
different between the two groups comparing the ipsilateral hemisphere
of the vehicle and IL-1β injected group (Fig. 7). Cresyl violet staining
revealed a reduction (26.8%, P b 0.05) in the number of healthy neurons
in the cortex of the IL-1 treated group, cells being darker stained with
angular cell bodies, indicative of pyknotic morphology (Fig. 8).
4. Discussion
Our ﬁndings show that systemic IL-1 administration just prior to
MCAo signiﬁcantly reduces reperfusion of the cerebral microvasculature

257

when compared to vehicle treated animals, potentially through hypercoagulation of CD41 + platelets and leukocytes within the cerebral
microvessels.
Infection and inﬂammation-related co-morbidities increase the risk
and worsen outcome in stroke patients (Bottcher and Falk, 1999; Grau
et al., 1995, Herz et al., 2015, Pinto et al., 2004, Smeeth et al., 2004). IL1 mimics aspects of infection and has been shown to exacerbate brain
damage and neuronal deﬁcit similar to the effects of bacterial endotoxin
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Denes et al., 2010a, 2010b, Denes et al., 2011,
McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b). Furthermore recent data show that infection worsens outcome in experimental stroke via IL-1 dependent mechanisms (Denes et al., 2014). This adds to the already extensive data
suggesting IL-1 as a key mediator of ischaemic injury (Murray et al.,
2015).The mechanisms by which systemic inﬂammation exacerbates
ischaemic brain damage remain to be fully determined; though effects
on the BBB and microvascular reperfusion have all been suggested to
have a role (McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b, Murray et al., 2013). Chronic
systemic inﬂammation is associated with increased platelet aggregation
after MCA occlusion (Denes et al., 2010a, 2010b) and here we show a
direct effect of systemic inﬂammation on haemodynamic parameters,
establishing a pro-coagulant state in which CD41 + platelets hypercoagulate within the microvasculature in a synergistic response to exacerbated microglial activation. We have also demonstrated that those
platelet aggregates do not form early after the ischaemic event,
i.e. 10 min after MCAo. Platelet aggregation promotes microvascular
dysfunction through activation and release of mediators which promote
leukocyte:platelet accumulation (Afshar-Kharghan and Thiagarajan,
2006). Physical obstruction of microvessels compromises collateral
blood ﬂow and contributes towards infarct expansion (Del Zoppo
et al., 1991). Hyper-coagulated platelet microthrombi could be

contributing to the lack of sustained reperfusion within the IL-1 injected
group through physical and pathological mechanisms. Platelets bound
to the wall of the endothelium become activated, stimulating the
release of potent cytokines IL-1α and TNF-α which induce endothelial
adhesion molecule upregulation, mediating leukocyte transmigration
in to the brain parenchyma (Afshar-Kharghan and Thiagarajan, 2006).
Although a deﬁnitive role for hyper-coagulated platelets has not been
investigated here, in human studies it has been found that a strong systemic platelet activation is associated with thrombin generation, leading
to platelet:platelet interactions as opposed to platelet:leukocyte interactions in different subtypes of cerebral ischaemia (Turgut et al., 2011). Experimental studies have found that LPS increases large heteroconjugates
of platelets and CD45-positive leukocyte subpopulations (Mirlashari
et al., 2002). Systemic IL-1 could be promoting platelet:leukocyte
heteroconjugation over platelet:platelet aggregation leading to secondary micro-occlusions within the larger microvessels following an ischaemic challenge. Platelets have also been shown to induce monocyte
chemotactic protein (MCP-1) and expression of ICAM-1 in endothelial
cells at sites of vascular injury via an IL-1 dependent mechanism

(Gawaz et al., 2000). These ﬁndings suggest that systemic IL-1 could be
exacerbating the coagulation cascade in response to an induced ischaemic event and thus promoting an exaggerated platelet:leukocyte adhesion and coagulation, increasing aggregate size. Confocal images from
our immunoﬂuorescence investigations revealed large platelet clusters
and cellular morhphological aggregates clogging the lumen and large
portions of larger microvessels. Without further markers we were unable
to identify if these cellular shapes where in fact leukocytes and further
research to speciﬁcally delineate the mechanisms by which IL-1β could
increase platelet adhesion with other platelets or leukocytes needs to
be undertaken.
IL-1α co-localized to Iba-1-positive microglia was more prevalent in
the IL-1β injected somatosensory cortex compared to the vehicle
injected however these values were not signiﬁcant. IL-1α activates
microvessel endothelial cells to upregulate adhesion molecules; ICAM1, VCAM-1 and CXCL1, which facilitate transendothelial migration of
leukocytes into the brain parenchyma, contributing to BBB breakdown
and ischaemic damage (McColl et al., 2007a, 2007b, Thornton et al.,
2010). Here we also saw that BBB dysfunction was exacerbated with

acute systemic IL-1 administration, agreeing with previous studies
where IL-1 was shown to result in loss of tight junctions as a result of
matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) release from neutrophils, leading
to proteolytic breakdown of the BBB (McColl, 2008). Other studies
conﬁrm that IL-1 driven leukocyte transmigration results in the release
of neurotoxic mediators from neutrophils that can exacerbate neuronal
damage (Allen et al., 2012).
In conclusion, we show for the ﬁrst time that, within 3 h of ﬁlament
removal, a systemic inﬂammatory challenge with IL-1 signiﬁcantly
exacerbates reperfusion deﬁcits following a 30 min focal ischaemic

event in the brain, highlighting the adverse effects co-morbidity can
have on the pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke. These ﬁndings reiterate the importance of including clinically relevant co-morbidities
in preclinical stroke research to improve the potential for translational
success.
