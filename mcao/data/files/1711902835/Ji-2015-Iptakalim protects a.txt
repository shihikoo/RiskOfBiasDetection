SUMMARY
It has been reported that the novel ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP) channel opener iptakalim (IPT) decreases
ischemic neuronal damage in rats. However, the mechanisms underlying neuroprotection are still to be fully elucidated. The results of this study showed that mice with
ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion exhibited higher mortality and more neurological deﬁcits, as well
as larger infarct volume, compared with sham mice. Moreover, it was found that ischemia activated astrocytes surrounding CA1 neurons with an increased expression of Dserine, induced greater microglial activation accompanied
by higher tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) production,
and caused higher expressions of matrix metalloproteinase
9 (MMP-9) in the endothelial cells of mice. Pretreatment
with IPT signiﬁcantly attenuated the neurological deﬁcits
and decreased the infarct volume in mice. IPT treatment
could decrease MMP-9 secretion, inhibit astrocytic activation with decreasing D-serine and elevating connexin43
expression. Microglial activation was also inhibited and
TNF-a production was decreased by IPT. Taken together, a
K-ATP channel opener may improve the function of neurovascular unit and protect against ischemic injury. These
ﬁndings suggest that targeting K-ATP channels provides a
promising therapeutic approach for stroke.
Key words: ATP-sensitive potassium channels, cerebral
ischemia, iptakalim, neurovascular unit.

energetics and electrical excitability. They are heteromultimers,
composed of four inwardly rectifying potassium channel pore subunits (Kir6.1 and Kir6.2) and four sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1
and SUR2).2 These channels are generally closed under normal
conditions but are activated rapidly in response to a decrease in
the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio under ischemic conditions, causing a K+ efﬂux and hyperpolarization of the cell membrane.3
Therefore, opening of K-ATP channels affords intrinsic protection by regulating membrane potential, and this has been associated with acute and delayed protective responses to cerebral
ischemia. It has been reported that overexpression of Kir6.2
decreases ischemic brain injury,4 and Kir6.2 knockout (Kir6.2 / )
mice have displayed enhanced neuronal damage after ischemic
insults.3 These ﬁndings indicate that K-ATP channels are directly
involved in neuroprotection against acute hypoxic or ischemic
insult.
To date, the majority of studies into the role of K-ATP channels in protecting against cerebral ischemia have focused on neurons. K-ATP channels are widely distributed in the brain. It has
been documented that neurons mainly express Kir6.2-containing
K-ATP channels, whereas Kir6.1 is the principal pore-forming
subunit of astrocytes and pericytes.1,5 Previous studies have demonstrated that microglia also express Kir6.1-based channels.6
There is accumulating evidence suggesting that a purely neurocentric view of cell death in stroke should shift towards a more
integrative approach that considers responses within all types of
brain cells and in the extracellular matrix. Blood ﬂow and brain
homoeostasis are disrupted in stroke; the cerebral endothelium
becomes dysfunctional, and astroglial and oligodendroglial processes are affected.7 Neuroinﬂammation, including microglial
activation, is triggered rapidly.8 Therefore, an ideal therapeutic
target for stroke is one that rescues neurovascular signaling and
is active in multiple brain-cell types.9 Recently, the neurovascular
unit has been proposed as a potential target for stroke intervention.10,11 The neurovascular unit refers to neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglias and microvascular endothelial cells
and their relationship.12,13 The concept of the neurovascular unit
requires a shift in emphasis from only neuronal death to an integrative response involving all brain cells.12,14,15 The widespread
distribution of K-ATP channels shows their potential role as central mediators in neurovascular coupling and function.
Iptakalim (IPT), [N-(1-methylethyl)-1,1,2-trimethyl-propylamine hydrochloride], is a fatty para-amino compound with low

molecular weight, and has been conﬁrmed as a selective K-ATP
channel opener via pharmacological and electrophysiological
studies, as well as receptor-combining tests. The aim of the present study is to demonstrate the mechanisms involved in IPT-mediated neuroprotection in middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO)-induced stroke mouse models.

RESULTS
IPT improves neurological deﬁcits and reduces cerebral
infarct size in mice
To evaluate the impact of IPT pretreatment during ischemia, the
neurological deﬁcit score and the infarct volume 24 hours after
MCAO were analyzed. The mice showed signiﬁcant neurological
deﬁcits, such as retracting left forepaw when lifted by the tail,
circling to the left, or falling while walking. Mice which had
received IPT pretreatment had fewer neurological deﬁcits than
the saline-injected ischemic mice (Fig. 1a).
Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) stain revealed that MCAO
signiﬁcantly induced brain infarction in mice. IPT pretreatment
remarkably reduced the infarct size. The reduction in infarct
volume evaluated 24 hours after MCAO was accompanied by a
signiﬁcant improvement in focal neurological deﬁcits (Fig. 1b,c).
IPT ameliorates dysfunction of endothelial cells after ischemia
Double immunoﬂuorescence staining was used to determine
expression of K-ATP channels in endothelial cells. The results
showed that CD31+ cells were positive for Kir6.1 and Kir6.2,
indicating that endothelial cells expressed Kir6.1- and Kir6.2based K-ATP channels (Fig. 2a). Double staining with an antimatrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-9) antibody and CD31
showed that MMP-9 was expressed within endothelial cells at
hour 3 after MCAO (Fig. 2b). These data suggest that MMP-9
was expressed at and around cerebral vessels in the mouse brain

in the early phase of ischemia. Immunoblotting showed that
ischemia upregulated MMP-9 expression in endothelial cells. The
expression MMP-9 in mice was suppressed by IPT (Fig. 2c).
IPT inhibts excessive astrocytic activation and improves
astrocytic function
After ischemia, astrocytes displayed reactive changes in hippocampi of mice, characterized by increasing the expression of glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the number of GFAP-positive cells. The number of astrocytes in the IPT pretreatment
group was higher than that of sham group. Pretreatment with IPT
inhibited the astrocytic activation in mice (Fig. 3a,b).
D-serine, which is thought to be one of the most important
glial transmitters, contributes to signaling transduction and information processing of astrocytes.16,17 To study the possible
involvement of D-serine in the transient ischemia pathogenesis
in vivo, we examined D-serine distribution in hippocampal CA1
region of ischemia mice (Fig. 3a). Double ﬂuorescence labeling
analysis with D-serine antibody and GFAP antibody revealed that
D-serine was localized and increased in activated astrocytes,
suggesting that IPT pretreatment could have reduced the levels of
D-serine.
Connexin 43 is the primary component protein of astrocytic
gap junctions and may be a marker of astrocytes.18,19 Due to its
prominent role in ischemia, its expression in the ipsilateral hippocampus after MCAO was examined. The level of connexin 43
protein was not altered in the mice after ischemia. Injection with
IPT increased the expression of connexin 43 protein (Fig. 3c).
IPT inhibits microglial activation and reduced the levels of
tumor necrosis factor-a
Activation of microglia is characterized by changing of the resting ramiﬁed types to fully amoeboid morphology. The number of
activated microglia and the soma volume of microglia were signiﬁcantly increased following ischemia, and were inhibited by
pretreatment with IPT (Fig. 4a–c).
The microglia produce tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) in the
early phase of ischemia.20 Our results showed that the levels of
TNF-a were consistent with the degree of microglia activation.
Ischemia attack signiﬁcantly increased the levels of TNF-a
expression in mice 24 hours after MCAO. Pretreatment IPT signiﬁcantly decreased the levels of TNF-a (Fig. 4d).

Excessive release of glutamate and activation of neuronal glutamate receptors are thought to be an important triggers for ischemia-induced neuronal damage, and glutamate released from
astrocytes is relevant to ischemia.21 Cumulative evidence, including that from our laboratory, suggests that activation of post-synaptic K-ATP channels limits glutamate-induced neuronal
excitability, thus blocking subsequent neurotoxic biochemical
cascades.22–25 In addition, activation of presynaptic K-ATP
channels may directly modulate neurotransmitter release from
nerve terminals.26 Our previous study demonstrated that K-ATP
channel opening could improve the function of astrocytic glutamate transporters.27 Further, the present study revealed that the

non-subunit selective K-ATP channel opener IPT exerted neuroprotective effects against ischemic insult in mice by improving
neurovascular unit function.
The endothelium is an important cellular constituent of the
neurovascular unit. The upstream signals of ischemia affect neutrophil and/or platelet interactions with activated endothelial
cells28 and, for example, after the onset of cerebral ischemia in
the nonhuman primate, microvascular endothelial cells display
signiﬁcant loss in integrin expression.29,30 The present data
showed that ischemia up-regulated MMP-9 production by endothelial cells. Although all the cellular constituents in the neurovascular unit are able to secrete MMP-9,31,32 during acute phases
of brain injury, MMP-9 is mainly secreted by endothelial cells
and mediates brain damage in stroke.33 Up-regulation of MMP-9
could disrupt the matrix, interrupting the neuron-matix integrin
pathways that might lead to neuronal anoikis.28 Treatment with
IPT may inhibit MMP-9 production, maintaining the integrity of

brain-blood barrier and thereby partially preserving the survival
signaling.
Ischemia-induced excessive activation of astrocytes was associated with increased D-serine level in the cytoplasm. D-serine, a
dominant co-agonist at the glycine site of the NR1 subunit in
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), is thought to be toxic
by exacerbating glutamate toxicity when its extracellular levels are
elevated.34 D-serine signaling is a prominent determinant of neuronal-glial dialogue in the healthy or diseased brain.17,35 Katsuki
et al. have provided evidence that endogenous D-serine has a signiﬁcant role in neuronal damage resulting from simulated ischemia.34,36 Thus, the elevated D-serine level is contributing to
neuronal damage in mouse brain. Pretreatment with IPT may suppress the activation of astrocytes and reduce the cytoplasm D-serine levels, and as a result, neuronal survival is improved in mice.
The expression of connexin 43, the primary component protein in
astrocytic gap junctions, was also elevated with IPT.37 Jane et al.

room at 20°C for an occlusion period of 24 hours. IPT was injected
intraperitoneally in a dose of 10 mg/kg, 30 minutes before ischemia.
The observed neurological deﬁcits of the experimental animals
were graded, 24 hours after MCAO, on a scale of 0–4 as
described previously.43 Grading criteria were as follows: grade 0,
no observable neurological deﬁcits; grade 1, failed to extend left
forepaw; grade 2, circled to the left; grade 3, fell to the left;
grade 4, could not walk spontaneously; and grade 5, dead.

have demonstrated that connexin 43 plays a key role in protection
in ischemia preconditioning,38 and up-regulation of connexion 43
could exert signiﬁcant neural protection against hypoxia. It has
been reported that K-ATP channel activation either directly or indirectly inhibits activation of phosphatases that dephosphorylate
connexin 43 during ischemia.39 The authors proposed that neurons
die in areas where astrocytes are malfunctioning, and the border of
the evolving infarct is deﬁned by astrocytes.40 Therefore, astrocytic
dysfunction promotes neuron death and eventually the neuronal
damage propagates in mice. This study also showed that ischemia
led to microglia activation and increased the levels of TNF-a,
which is involved in stroke initiation and progressive brain damage
in acute stroke.41,42 Glial activation was inhibited by IPT and thus
protected neurons against the inﬂammatory injury in mouse brain.

CONCLUSION
In the present study, evidence has been provided that the K-ATP
channel opener IPT may improve the function of neurovascular
unit and protect brain against ischemic injury. The ﬁndings suggest that K-ATP channels regulate the function of neurovascular
unit, and targeting K-ATP channels provides a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic brain lesion.

METHODS

In order to compare infarct sizes in the ischemia-treated groups,
infarct volumes were measured 24 hours after ischemia (n = 8–
10 per group). The mouse was decapitated, and the brain was
sliced into four 2-mm coronal sections. The brain slices were
then stained with 2% 2, 3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC;
Boquan, Nanjing, China) at 37°C for 1 hour. The areas of sections with infarcts were measured using an image analysis system
(Image-Pro Plus; Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA).
Brain ﬁxation
Mice were killed with chloral hydrate (150 mg/kg, ip). The heart
was exposed, an incision was made in the right ventricle, and a
hypodermic syringe was used to perfuse with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) followed by 20 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS. The whole brain was removed and postﬁxed at 4°C for
24 hours. Sections measuring 40 lm were then used for immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue was brought to room temperature and hydrated in PBS. For
immunoperoxidase localization, endogenous peroxidase was
quenched with 3% H2O2 in PBS. After quenching, tissue sections
were blocked with 5% BSA in PBS, and then incubated with the
primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The sections were rinsed with
PBS and the primary antibodies (rabbit anti-GFAP, 1:5000, Abcam,
Cambridge, UK; rat anti-Mac-1, Serotec, Oxford, UK). Sections
were then incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies and
immunoreactivity was visualized with 0.05% 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as chromagen. For double immunoﬂuorescence, the primary antibodies (mouse anti-GFAP, 1:1000, Millipore Chemicon,
USA; rabbit anti-D-serine, 1:1500, Serotec; rabbit anti-MMP-9,
1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA; mouseanti CD31, 1:50, Santa Cruz; goat anti-Kir6.1, 1:100, Santa Cruz;
rabbit anti-Kir6.2, Santa Cruz) were localized with the use of
secondary antibodies conjugated to FITC or TRITC.

Animal model and experimental protocol
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Nanjing Medical University. Eight- to 12-weekold male mice, weighing 26 to 35 g, were anaesthetized with intraperitoneal (ip) injection of chloral hydrate (150 mg/kg). Following
anaesthesia they were subjected to permanent focal cerebral ischemia, induced using an intraluminal ﬁlament technique with a
monoﬁlament nylon suture as described.43 After recovering from
anaesthesia, the animals were maintained in an air-conditioned

extent of the hippocampus was selected, yielding an average of
eight sections per animal for analysis. The boundaries were

magniﬁcation lens (6.3 9 0.16 NA). The total number (N) of
GFAP-positive cells was estimated with the optical dissector following fractionator rules and a semiautomated system (STEREOINVESTIGATOR software, MBF Bioscience, Microbrightﬁeld, VT,
USA). The somal volume of the microglia cell body was calculated
in every ﬁfth counted microglial cell using the nucleator probe.
Western blotting
Mouse hippocampus was homogenized with homogenization buffer containing the following: 25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.05%
b-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmol/L per litre EDTA, 0.05 mmol/L per
litre EGTA, 100 mM PMSF, 1 mg/mL aprotinin and 1 mg/mL
leupeptin). After centrifugation, the lysate was collected for MMP9 and connexin-43 western blotting. MMP-9 and connexin-43 western blotting was performed by using anti-MMP-9 (1:200, Santa
Cruz) and anti-connexin-43 antibody (1:500; Chemicon) respectively, and secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Anti-b-actin antibody (1:15 000, Sigma Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA) was used as control. Blots were developed by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), digitally scanned
and analyzed (Omega 16IC, Ultra-Lum, Claremont, CA, USA).
Tumor necrosis factor-a measurements
The amount of TNF-a in the brain was determined with a rat
TNF-a enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
All values are expressed as mean  SEM. Statistical difference
between the groups were determined by one-way or two-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student-Newman-Keuls
tests. Differences were considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.
