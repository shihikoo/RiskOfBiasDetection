Abstract
Background: Focal cerebral ischemia results in delayed neurodegeneration in remote brain regions, such as the
substantia nigra. To date, a reasonable explanation is still lacking regarding the correlation of magnetic resonance
(MR) signal pseudo-normalization following a transient abnormal change and subsequent progressive pathological
damage.
Purpose: To characterize the substantia nigra following middle cerebral artery occlusion and to evaluate the potential
pathophysiological changes associated with the pseudo-normalization of MR signals in the substantia nigra at the subacute
stage after stroke onset.
Material and Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. During the
occlusion of single middle cerebral artery, computed tomography (CT) perfusion was acquired to observe the blood flow
perfusion in the primary ischemic striatum and ipsilateral substantia nigra. Next, the MR T2 relaxation time and apparent
diffusion coefficient changes within the substantia nigra were determined on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after stroke onset, and
compared with immunohistochemistry for microglia activation and astrogliosis.
Results: Twenty-four rats with strong hypoperfusion in the primary ischemic territory and no alterations of the perfusion in the ipsilateral substantia nigra detected both visually and measurably during the middle cerebral artery occlusion
were further studied. All animals showed MR pseudo-normalization with T2 relaxation time and apparent diffusion
coefficient recovered in the ipsilateral substantia nigra at the subacute phase following focal cerebral ischemia.
Normalization of the MR signals corresponded well with the spatio-temporal occurrence of microglia activation and
astrogliosis.
Conclusion: The pseudo-normalization of T2 relaxation time and apparent diffusion coefficient reflects the neuroinflammatory changes that accompany activation of microglia and astrocytes in the ipsilateral substantia nigra following
middle cerebral artery occlusion.

Introduction
It is well known that focal cerebral ischemia causes
neuronal damage in the territory of disturbed cerebral
vessels. In addition to this neuronal injury, cerebral
ischemia triggers changes in remote areas that are separated from the aﬀected vessels. The substantia nigra
(SN) is nourished by the perforating branches of the
posterior cerebral artery (PCA), which originate from

the initial portion of the superior cerebellar artery
(SCA) in rats. In the SN, middle cerebral artery
(MCA) occlusion in rats induces extensive delayed SN
neurodegeneration, and stroke patients with striatal
damage also display SN degeneration following the
onset of ischemia (1,2). The SN is a key structure
involved in motor control, and has bi-directional neuronal connections with the striatum, which becomes
ischemic after MCA occlusion (3). Although the mechanisms underlying remote injury are largely unclear, it
has been proposed that post-ischemic alterations of the
striato-nigral gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
system are associated with neuronal loss in the SN
and subsequent motor deﬁcits.
Imaging techniques, such as computed tomography
(CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play an
important role in the diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making for ischemic stroke (4). Using T2-weighted
(T2W) imaging and diﬀusion-weighted imaging (DWI),
previous studies (1,5–8) have detected remote neurodegeneration of the ipsilateral SN following focal cerebral
ischemia, which resulted in T2W imaging and DWI
hyperintensity signals within 3 to 5 days in rats and
at 1 to 4 weeks after striatal ischemia in patients.
These results share a common characteristic that T2W
imaging and DWI are associated with a delayed normointensity in the SN after a transient abnormal signal
both in patients and animals. However, studies performed in rat have demonstrated that focal cerebral
ischemia can cause severe and prolonged neuronal
damage in the ipsilateral SN, and these pathological
changes are not static but progressive (2). To date, a
reasonable explanation is still lacking regarding the correlation of MR signal pseudo-normalization and the
subsequent progressive pathological damage. Thus,
we performed CT perfusion to conﬁrm successful
focal cerebral ischemia and to ensure stable blood
ﬂow perfusion in the SN. We investigated the MR
signal in the remote SN over time after a unilateral
MCA occlusion and compared these MR data with
immunohistochemistry analyses.

Material and Methods
Middle cerebral artery occlusion and protocol
This study was performed according to the National
Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of
laboratory animals. All protocols were approved by the
medical experiment animal administrative committee of
Shanghai. All eﬀorts were made to minimize animal
suﬀering and to reduce the number of animals used.
Healthy adult male Sprague Dawley rats (180–230 g)
from the Shanghai Experimental Animal Centre were
used in this study. Rats were anesthetized with an

intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (350–
400 mg/kg). The rectal temperature was monitored
and maintained at 37  0.5 C using a controlled water
ﬂow system throughout the procedure. Rats were subjected to focal cerebral ischemia induced by a transient
left MCA occlusion as previously described (5,9).
Brieﬂy, the left external carotid artery (ECA) was initially ligated and transected to generate an ECA stump.
Next, a nylon ﬁlament was introduced into the ECA
stump and advanced into the internal carotid artery
(ICA) to block blood ﬂow to MCA.
During MCA occlusion, computed tomography
(CT) perfusion was performed to observe blood ﬂow
perfusion of the MCA territory and SN. Twenty-four
rats were further studied, which showed impaired perfusion in the striatum and constant perfusion in the SN
and were randomly assigned to each time point groups
(n ¼ 6 animals each). Post-ischemic reperfusion was
performed at 90 min after MCA occlusion by suture
removal until its tip reached the ECA stump. In six
rats from each time point, T2W imaging, T2 map,
and DWI were performed on days 1, 3, 7, and 14
using a MR scanner. After MRI, the brains were
removed and processed for histological examination.

CT perfusion imaging and analysis
CT perfusion imaging was performed using a multislice CT scanner (Light-Speed 16, GE Healthcare,
Milwaukee, WI, USA). The anesthetized rat was
placed in a supine position in a custom-made board
on the CT scanning table. The animal’s venous catheter
was inserted into the femoral vein and connected to an
automated injector. An un-enhanced CT scan was ﬁrst
obtained to localize the lesion. The parameters were:
120 kV; 100 mA; slice thickness, 2.5 mm; ﬁeld of view
(FOV), 9.6  9.6 cm; matrix, 512  512; scanning time,
1 s/scan. Next, perfusion scanning was performed using
the cine scan technique, which covered the frontal lobe
to the medulla. A non-ionic type CT contrast agent
(Iohexol, 300 mg I/mL, GE Healthcare) was applied
via the femoral vein using the automated injector at a
dose of 2 mL with an injection ﬂow rate of 1 mL/s. In
addition, perfusion imaging was scanned and repeated
50 times. The parameters of cine scanning were the
same as the un-enhanced scanning.
The CT perfusion raw data were transferred to a
dedicated workstation (Advantage Windows 4.1, GE
Healthcare). For all datasets, perfusion analysis was
performed using the CT Perfusion 3.0 software. The
basilar artery and superior sagittal sinus were selected
as the input artery and output vein (regions of interest
range, 18–25 mm2), respectively. The images produced
by the software were represented as three parametric
maps: cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF), cerebral blood

volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT). Regions
of interest (ROIs) were placed onto the striatum and
substantia nigra of the ischemic and intact side on the
perfusion parametric maps. Representative parametric
values obtained from two radiologists with years of
experience of CT perfusion imaging were averaged.
The relative perfusion parameters (ipsilateral/contralateral region) were expressed as the mean  standard
deviation.

MRI and analysis
We performed MRI scan using a GE Signa VH/i
system equipped with a 3.0-T superconducting magnet
(GE Healthcare) (9). Multi-slice T2W fast spin-echo
imaging was performed and resulted in 12 contiguous
slices in the coronal plane: TR, 4000 ms; TE, 120 ms;
slice thickness, 2 mm; spacing, 0; FOV, 60  60 mm;
matrix, 256  192; NEX, 4; scanning time, 3 min 24 s.
Multi-echo T2W imaging was used to acquire the T2
map: TR, 3000 ms; TE, 159.9/146.6/133.2/119.9/106.6/
93.3/79.9/66.6/53.3/40.0/26.6/13.3 ms; slice thickness,
2 mm; spacing, 0; FOV, 60  60 mm; matrix,
256  160; NEX, 1; scanning time, 5 min 20 s. DWI
with diﬀusion-sensitive gradients in three dimensions
(single-shot spin-echo echo planar images) was used:
TR, 3500 ms; TE, 94.4 ms; slice thickness, 2 mm; spacing, 0; FOV, 40  40 mm; matrix, 64  96; NEX, 8; b,
0,1000 s/mm2; scanning time, 1 min 56 s.
For images analysis, MR digital imaging and communications in medicine format (DICOM) images were
transferred from the picture archive and communications system (PACS) to a separate personal computer
(MacPro, Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA). OsiriX (version 4.1, OsiriX Foundation, Geneva, Switzerland),
and free and open source postprocessing and fusion
software tool (free down load from http://www.osirixviewer.com) were used. For the quantiﬁcation analysis,
the sync series analyze tool was used to synchronize the
cursor on T2W imaging to the T2 map and ADC map
onto the same slice image. The ROIs were drawn on the
ischemic ipsilateral and contralateral SN. ROIs were
visually matched between sequences to avoid the outermost pixels and to minimize partial volume eﬀects. The
ROI analyze tool was used to store the ROIs and to
determine the average T2 relaxation time (ms),
ADC (mm2/s), and standard deviation values from
each region.

Tissue processing and staining
On days 1, 3, 7, and 14, after all imaging experiments,
six rats from each time point were anesthetized and
perfused through the left ventricle with 50 mL of
saline, followed by 100 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde.

The brains were rapidly removed, and immersion-ﬁxed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buﬀer
and embedded in paraﬃn at 4 C until further use.
Subsequently, 10-mm-thick coronal sections corresponding to each MR slice images were cut using a
microtome, and sections in the SN were stained using
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). Microglia (CD68
immuno-positive cells) and astrocytes (GFAP
immuno-positive cells) were detected using standard
diaminobenzidine (DAB) immunohistochemisty with
the CD68 monoclonal antibody (Biolegend, San
Diego, CA, USA) and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) antibody (GeneTex, San Antonio, TX,
USA), respectively. The number of CD68-positive
cells and GFAP-positive cells were quantiﬁed at a magniﬁcation in a blind manner using a computerized
image-analysis system consisting of a NIS camera
installed onto an Olympus light microscope, which
was attached to a personal computer. Data were
expressed as the mean  standard deviation numbers
of cells (i.e. cell number/mm3).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The
relative CT perfusion parameters, T2 relaxation times,
ADC, CD68- and GFAP-positive cell number were
compared using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for separated measures. Comparisons
between ipsilateral and contralateral regions were
then made using Student’s t-test. The level of statistical
signiﬁcance was P < 0.05 throughout this study.

Results
Cerebral blood flow perfusion changes in the
striatum and substantia nigra during MCA occlusion
During MCA occlusion, CT perfusion was performed
to monitor blood ﬂow perfusion in the brain.
Heterogeneous decreases of tissue perfusion in the
MCA territory were detected in ischemic animals. At
30 min after MCA occlusion, the CBF and CBV in the
ischemic striatum decreased compared with the
contralateral striatum, and the MTT was prolonged
(Fig. 1a–c), which conﬁrmed a successful MCA occlusion. The relative perfusion values of the bilateral striatum at 30 min were rCBF 0.23  0.08, rCBV
0.75  0.09, rMTT 4.44  0.11. In contrast, the CT perfusion data showed constant blood ﬂow perfusion in
the SN (Fig. 1d–f) with relative values of rCBF of
1.03  0.06, rCBV 0.98  0.07, rMTT 1.01  0.05.
Thus, the premise of studying remote changes was
established. Compared between the perfusion

parameters after MCA occlusion, there was statistical
signiﬁcance in the CBF, CBV, and MTT in the bilateral
striatum (P < 0.05), but no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between the ipsilateral and contralateral SN (P > 0.05).

Temporal profile of magnetic resonance T2 relaxation time and ADC in the substantia nigra after MCA
occlusion
The primary ischemic lesion was developed in the striatum in all grouped MCA occlusion rats. In the SN
section, there were no visible and measurable diﬀerences between the bilateral SN in T2 relaxation time
(80.2  8.1 ms vs. 77.7  9.8 ms) and ADC value
(7.88  0.78  104 mm2/s vs. 8.09  1.02  104
mm2/s) on day 1 after stroke (Fig. 2a and f). On day
3, the ipsilateral SN to the MCA occlusion showed a T2
hyperintensity signal and ADC low signal compared to
the contralateral SN (Fig. 2b, g, h) (T2 relaxation time

respectively). At the subacute stage, days 7 and 14,
abnormal changes could not be discriminated in both
the qualitative and quantitative determination on the
T2 map and ADC map (Fig. 2c, d, i) (T2 relaxation

7.59  0.89  104 mm2/s on day 14, respectively). The
dynamic changes of T2 relaxation time and ADC in the
SN after MCA occlusion are shown in Fig. 2e and j.
Compared with the T2 relaxation time and ADC
between the bilateral SN after MCA occlusion, there
were statistical signiﬁcances on day 3 (*P < 0.05), but

no signiﬁcant diﬀerences on days 1, 7, and 14
(P > 0.05).

Morphological observation of H&E staining in the
substantia nigra after MCA occlusion
In the ipsilateral SN with respect to the MCA occluded
side, most neurons in the pars reticulata lacked an
abnormal appearance as assessed using H&E staining
and a light microscope on day 1 after MCA occlusion
(Fig. 3a). On day 3 post ischemia, the neuronal cells
were swollen, the neuropil was slightly vacuolated, and
the perivascular spaces were enlarged (Fig. 3b). The
pars reticulata of the SN became smaller compared to
the contralateral side after 7 and 14 days. The reactive
glia gradually increased in number on days 7 and 14
(Fig. 3c, d).

Proliferation of CD68 and GFAP immuno-positive cell
in the substantia nigra after MCA occlusion
We next investigated whether immunohistochemical
changes occurred in the SN after focal cerebral
ischemia. Representative microphotographs of CD68
immunostaining in the SN after stroke are shown in
Fig. 4a–d and GFAP immunostaining in Fig. 4e–h.
The number of CD68 and GFAP positive cells were
25  7 /mm3 and 35  9 /mm3 on day 1, 30  5 /mm3
and 42  8 /mm3 on day 3, 42  5 /mm3 and 62  10 /
mm3 on day 7, and 52  9 /mm3 and 71  9 /mm3 on
day 14, respectively. In the contralateral SN, a small
number of CD68 and GFAP immuno-positive cells
were observed at each time point, in which the
number of CD68 and GFAP positive cells were 20  5
/mm3 and 32  7 /mm3 on day 1, 25  5 /mm3 and

Fig. 2. Alteration of T2 (a–d, g) and ADC (f, h, i) signals in the SN after MCA occlusion. On day 1 post ischemia, there is no abnormal
signal on both sides of the SN. On day 3 after stroke, high T2 and low ADC signal can be visualized in ischemic ipsilateral SN (b, g, h).
On days 7 and 14, the T2 elevation and ADC decline had recovered (c, d, i). The line diagrams illustrated the temporal profile of T2
relaxation time (e) and ADC (j) in the ischemic ipsilateral and intact SN on days 1, 3, 7, and 14. *P < 0.05, significantly different
compared to the contralateral region.

after MCA occlusion. Using light microscopy, there was no abnormal change in the SN on day 1. On day 3 after stroke, the neuronal
cells were swollen, neuropils are vacuolated, and the perivascular spaces are enlarged with light microscope observation (b).
Subsequently, vacuolation of neuropil became milder, and the reactive glia gradually increased in number (c, d).

from 7 days up to 14 days after focal cerebral ischemia (b, c) compared to days 1 (a) and 3. Similarly, the expression of GFAP
immunoreaction increased in the ipsilateral SN on 7 and 14 days (f, g) compared to day 1 (e) and 3. The line diagrams illustrated the
CD68 (d) and GFAP positive cell number (h) in the ipsilateral and contralateral SN on days 1, 3, 7, and 14. *P < 0.05, significantly

day 7, and 28  6 /mm3 and 32  7 /mm3 on day 14.
Compared with the SN on the ischemic and intact side,
on days 1 and 3 post ischemia, there were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in both immunostaining results (P > 0.05).
In contrast, there was a signiﬁcantly increased number
of CD68 positive microglia and GFAP positive astrocytes within the ipsilateral SN compared to the contralateral SN 7–14 days after focal cerebral ischemia
(*P < 0.05).

Discussion
This study was performed in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Our data revealed MR signal pseudonormalization phenomenon with T2 relaxation time
and apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient recovered in the ipsilateral SN at the subacute phase after stroke onset.
Normalization of the T2 relaxation time and apparent
diﬀusion coeﬃcient corresponded well with the spatiotemporal occurrence of microglia activation and
astrogliosis.
With the present data, three aspects need to be
addressed. The ﬁrst issue involves the essential study
of the precondition of remote degeneration following
focal cerebral ischemia. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst study to employ CT perfusion to study
remote degeneration after MCA occlusion. Impaired
hemodynamic changes in the MCA territory were
clearly demonstrated using the CT perfusion technique.
However, in the SN, there was no visibly and measurably abnormal perfusion on all perfusion parametric
maps. The diﬀerent tissue perfusions between the striatum and SN at the early stage after focal cerebral
ischemia demonstrated success of the animal model
and enabled studies on pathogenesis in the remote site.
The second issue relates to the immunohistochemistry feature in the SN following striatal ischemia. A signiﬁcant increase in the number of microglia and
astrocyte was observed in the pars reticulata of the ipsilateral SN 7–14 days after focal cerebral ischemia.
Thus, speciﬁc evidence supports that inﬂammatory processes participate in the pathogenesis and execution of
remote neurodegeneration. Activated microglia and
astrocytes spread in the pars reticulata in a diﬀuse pattern, which might be due to the selective neuronal loss
in the absence of necrosis in the ischemic remote region.
The third issue involves changes in the T2 relaxation
time and ADC in the SN following MCA occlusion.
First, the present study eﬀectively illustrated neurodegeneration of the ipsilateral SN. On day 3 after stroke,
degeneration was demonstrated as a prolonged T2
relaxation time and decreased ADC. It is well known
the reduced ADC is the most sensitive indication of
swollen cells after focal ischemic brain damage, and

T2 elevation is a good method to image brain edema
after infarction. These current results were consistent
with results obtained in previous experimental studies
(7,8,10–12). These signal changes were present later
compared to the primary ischemic lesion and may be
caused by swelling astrocytes and neurons. Thus, the
MR signal can reﬂect the secondary neuronal swelling
in the ipsilateral SN after MCA occlusion.
Subsequently, the T2 relaxation time and ADC of the
ipsilateral SN recovered to the same extent as
the contralateral side, which corresponded well with
the spatio-temporal distribution of astrogliosis and
microglia activation. In fact, this correlation between
MR signals and inﬂammatory cell proliferation has
been observed in primary ischemic studies (13–16). In
a primary ischemic lesion, glial activation and inﬁltration of hematogenous cells induced ADC normalization and reduced T2 elevation at the sub-acute phase
following focal cerebral ischemia. The intense areas of
inﬂammatory cell proliferation showed MR fogging
presentation with normal tissue. Thus, changes in the
T2 relaxation time and ADC could undergo characteristic changes and diﬀerentiate distinct stages of the
inﬂammatory response and tissue remodeling after
stroke both in primary and remote sites.
In conclusion, pseudo-normalization of the T2 relaxation time and apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient reﬂects the
neuroinﬂammatory changes in the activation of microglia and astrocytes in the ipsilateral substantia nigra
after middle cerebral artery occlusion.
