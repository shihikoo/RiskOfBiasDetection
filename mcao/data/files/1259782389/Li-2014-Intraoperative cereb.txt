Intraoperative monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) is of interest to neuroscience researchers,
which offers the assessment of hemodynamic responses throughout the process of neurosurgery and
provides an early biomarker for surgical guidance. However, intraoperative CBF imaging has been
challenging due to animal’s motion and position change during the surgery. In this paper, we presented a design of an operation bench integrated with laser speckle contrast imager which enables
monitoring of the CBF intraoperatively. With a specially designed stereotaxic frame and imager, we
were able to monitor the CBF changes in both hemispheres during the rodent surgery. The rotatable
design of the operation plate and implementation of online image registration allow the technician
to move the animal without disturbing the CBF imaging during surgery. The performance of the
system was tested by middle cerebral artery occlusion model of rats. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

I. INTRODUCTION

Real time cerebral blood flow (CBF) serves as an important physiologic marker, which promptly reflects the in vivo
hemodynamic and cerebral circulation status. In rodent stroke
models, such as intraluminal filament model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),1 intraoperative CBF could be
used to confirm the success of occlusion. It also provides the
early prediction of brain injury in MCAO and potential real
time guidance for the surgery operation to improve the modeling stability.2 Moreover, continuous monitoring of CBF helps
to unravel mechanisms of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion to
the cognitive impairment, and thus optimize the time window
for therapeutics.3, 4 Intraoperative CBF monitoring also has
a variety of clinical applications, e.g., the detection of cerebral hypoperfusion in carotid endarterectomy,5 identification
of clip-related blood vessel stenosis or occlusion,6 evaluation of bypass patency during extracranial-intracranial bypass
grafts,7 and assessment of repurfusion of revascularization,8
etc.
There have been various imaging techniques for monitoring CBF, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),9
positron emission tomography (PET),10 and cerebral perfusion computed tomography (CT),11 etc. However, the acceptance of these techniques in intraoperative CBF monitoring
was hampered due to many factors, such as high cost, poor
temporal or spatial resolution, use of radioactive tracers, and
assessibility of the facilities.
Currently, the most used intraoperative CBF monitoring technique is laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), which provides continuous, noninvasive, and real time measurement of
blood flow in vessels.12, 13 However, the accuracy of LDF
is compromised by the physical motion of the subject or
the orientation of the Doppler probe. Moreover, the sina) Author to whom correspondence should be addressed. Electronic mail:

gle point measurement might not be representative of overall blood flow because of the spatial heterogeneity of the
microvasculature.14
Other optical methods can also be used for obtaining
CBF information in vivo. Doppler optical coherence tomography (OCT)15 has great spatial resolution, which enables us
to monitor capillary CBF. Photoacoustic tomography (PAT)16
is capable of imaging deep vessels for its strength in depth
penetration. However, both methods suffer from poor temporal resolution due to time-consuming scanning, thus are not
suitable for real-time and intraoperative imaging.
In contrast, laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) is
a non-contact full-field technique which provides twodimension CBF information with high spatial and temporal resolution.17 LSCI has been successfully used to get the
structural and functional changes of CBF in a wide range
of biomedical applications.18–22 Clinically, CBF data could
be obtained intraoperatively using LSCI in patients undergoing surgical revascularization.8, 23 It is noted that nearly all
LSCI applications require the subjects to be placed in prone
position,8, 24, 25 while many neurosurgeries require the subjects to be placed in supine position,26, 27 thus making the
existing LSCI systems unsuitable for intraoperative imaging.
Therefore, an intraoperative LSCI system is in great need to
perform real time full field CBF imaging in a wide range of
bomedical studies.
In this work, we present a design of a novel operation
system integrated with a LSCI imager for intraopreative CBF
monitoring during the experiment of rodents modeling. The
system consists of an operation bench specially designed for
animals in either supine or prone positions. The system is robust to the motions due to surgical operations, which is particularly useful in experimental studies, e.g., rodent MCAO
model.28
We tested the system performance in rat model of MCAO
experiment. MCAO comprises a battery of vascular surgeries and operations, which is similar to many clinical or

pre-clinical neurovascular surgeries. Besides, each phase of
MCAO surgery could lead to immediate cerebral blood flow
change, which makes it an ideal application to test the performance of the system.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. System design

The whole system consisted of a specially designed operation bench, a LSCI imager, and the graphic-user interface
(GUI) software.
1. Operation bench

Fig. 1 shows the schematic of operation bench including four major components: (1) a workbench as the supporting frame and workspace; (2) a round operation plate (OP),
which can be rotated continuously up to 180◦ so that animals
can be moved intraoperatively to the appropriate surgical orientation. The OP is specially designed with a center window
(2 cm in diameter) for CBF imaging in supine position. (3) A
specially designed two-mode stereotaxic frame that can be in-

Rev. Sci. Instrum. 85, 094301 (2014)

stalled with either a standard prone adaptor or a self-designed
supine adaptor (Fig. 1(a)). The stereotaxic frame was remodeled from a commercially available setup (68001-Single Manipulator Stereotaxic, RWD Life Science, Shenzhen, China).
In order to fix the animal in supine position, the stereotaxic
frame was re-designed so that the ear bar holders could be
adjusted in z-direction (see the inset of zoom-in design in
Fig. 1). (4) An imager container attached to the OP from
the bottom. When the technician moves the OP during the
surgery, the imager will move simultaneously so that the
real time CBF monitoring would not be interrupted. Fig. 1
shows the 3D details of the major modules. Fig. 2 shows the
schematics and the optical paths of the system working in both
supine and prone positions. Fig. 3 shows the snapshots of the
whole system in an experiment when the rat is fixed in either supine position (Figs. 3(a) and 3(c)) or prone position
(Figs. 3(b) and 3(d)).
2. LSCI imager

The overall design of the high spatiotemporal resolution
LSCI imager is shown in Fig. 1(d) (20 fps, 1280 × 1024
pixels). The spatial and temporal resolution is 4.65 μm and

50 ms, respectively. And the imager is mounted on the top of
the bench by a desk-mountable arm when working in prone
position as shown in Figs. 2(b) and 3(b). The schematic of
the imager is illustrated in Fig. 1(e). The motion artifacts due
to respiration and surgical motion were suppressed by registered laser speckle contrast analysis (rLASCA)29 algorithm.
Nevertheless, the real time registration is time consuming. To
improve the computational efficiency, we implemented the
real-time registration on NVIDIA’s parallel computing architecture (i.e., Compute Unified Device Architecture, or
CUDA) based on graphics processing unit (GPU). As illustrated in Fig. 4(c), the selected vessels drifted out of the region of interest (ROI) during the surgery, which could be successfully corrected by online registration (see Figs. 4(d) and 5
(Multimedia view)).

3. GUI-software

The imager was neatly connected to the computer via a
USB connection, plus a cable for power supply. Based on Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC, Microsoft Inc., USA), a
GUI-based software was developed for online imager control, CBF view, CBF analysis in selected ROIs, and data
exporting as shown in Fig. 4(a). The imager control is to
configure the CCD camera parameters (e.g., exposure time,
frame rate, etc.), focus the lens, and switch the light source.
The CBF images can also be exported for offline processing.
For different applications, three laser speckle contrast analysis algorithms were implemented, i.e., spatial laser speckle
contrast analysis (sLASCA),30 temporal laser speckle contrast analysis (tLASCA),31 and random process estimator

(RPE) method.32 The software enables preview of the relative
CBF changes over baseline in multiple ROIs as illustrated in
Fig. 4(a), so that the technician could get real time feedback
during the operation.
B. Demo of intraoperative CBF monitoring
in rat MCAO model

We demonstrate the system in monitoring CBF changes
of a rat, during surgery of intraluminal MCAO experiment.
The experimental protocols were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Med-X Research Institute of
Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
1. Animal preparation

An adult male Sprague-Dawley rat (Shanghai Slac Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), weighing 400 g,
was anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 7% chloral hydrate (5 ml/kg). Then the rat was immobilized in the
customized stereotaxic frame fixed on the OP and the body
temperature was maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5 ◦ C with a heating
pad (FHC, Bowdoinham, USA). The rat skull was exposed
by a midline scalp incision and the tissue over the bones was
cleaned by a scalpel. A 14 mm × 14 mm cranial window
(overlying the cortex) was thinned with a high speed dental
drill (Strong 90 Micro Motor, Saeshin Precision, Korea) with
Ø 1.4 mm steel burr until the cortical vessels were clearly
visible. Saline was applied to prevent the calorification of the
skull during the thinning process. After the CBF imaging window was prepared, the rat was then supinely fixed for surgery
of intraluminal MCAO experiment.

2. Permanent MCAO (pMCAO)

The MCAO procedures followed previously published
protocols.26 The right common carotid artery (CCA) and external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed through a midline
neck incision and the soft tissues were pull apart. The right
CCA and ECA were ligated with 5-0 silk suture lines. The
internal carotid artery (ICA) was isolated and occluded by a
curved microvascular clip temporally. A nylon suture (length:
4.0 cm; diameter: 0.36 mm) with 5-mm silicone coating (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) was advanced
into ICA through a small cut in the right CCA before the bifurcation between ECA and ICA. A knot was made to fix the
filament and prevent errhysis. After the clip was released, the
suture was advanced up to 18 mm from the bifurcation point
of CCA and then drawn back. We purposely moved the suture back and forth. The changes in CBF were imaged and are
illustrated in Fig. 6(b).
3. Data analysis and acquisition

We selected the ROIs including two major arteries from
both contralateral and ipsilateral cortices. Baseline CBF was
assessed with the averaged contrast values at 1-min temporal interval before the surgery. The real time relative CBF
changes were shown in a separate window, so that the technician could observe the CBF responses during the surgery.
III. RESULTS

Besides the standard surgery of intraluminal MCAO
experiment, we purposely manipulated the suture insertion depth to test the CBF responses. Figs. 6(b) and

operations are designated, i.e., (I) ligating the right CCA and ECA, (II) clipping the right ICA, (III) inserting the suture, (IV) drawing back the suture, (V)

CBF in two selected ROIs (ROI0 , contralateral; ROI1 , ipsilateral) throughout the experiment.
Ligating the right CCA and ECA resulted in a decrease
of CBF in ROI0 to ∼75% which recovered to the baseline be-

fore dropping to ∼66% after clipping the right ICA. The CBF
in ROI1 dropped less but recovered faster than that in ROI0
during the same period. Right after the suture was inserted
into the right CCA, there was a sharp drop of CBF in ROI0 .
It is shown that the CBF had an immediate reperfusion in

contralateral area after the suture was drawn back from the
right CCA, which notably recovered to more than 110% of
baseline. We further advanced and then drew back the filament along the CCA, and the CBF imaging could respond
to the operation accurately. The recovery of CBF in ROI0 became slower in subsequent filament withdrawals, which might
be due to the contralateral injury from ischemia. In contrast,
ipsilateral CBF remained stable at the baseline level after clipping the right ICA. These results suggest that this system is
capable of monitoring the CBF intraoperatively.
IV. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we presented a design of system for intraoperative real-time monitoring of CBF in rodent experiments.
The system included a specially designed operation bench, an
LSCI imager, and CBF imaging software. The imager could
be installed either under or above the bench so as to monitor the CBF during the surgery with the animals in either
supine or prone position. CBF acquisition, analysis, preview,
and data output at selected ROIs could be easily controlled
with a GUI software. Real-time registration of raw speckle
images was implemented to correct the motion artifacts.
Though we demonstrated the intraoperative CBF monitoring in rodent model of MCAO, our imaging system could
also be readily applied to other experimental studies, such as
the induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)33 for hemorrhagic stroke study, and animal model vascular conduits.34
And clinically, it could also be translated to potential applications including carotid endarterectomy,5 extracranialintracranial bypass grafts,7 or revascularization,8 etc.
