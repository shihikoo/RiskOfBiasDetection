Introduction

Autophagy (cellular self-digestion) is a bulk protein degradation system that the damaged, death or worn out cellular
components even organelles can be degraded in this evolutionary conserved process. Autophagy as one of cellular
stress responses can be involved in both physiological and
pathological conditions such as cell differentiation, starvation, infections, and presence of dysfunctional or damaged
cellular macromolecules (Puyal et al., 2012).
In recent studies, autophagy has already been discovered
as an essential mechanism of many diseases especially

neurodegenerative diseases (Metcalf et al., 2012). Autophagy
can be found out in multiple ischemic diseases including
cerebral ischemia as well (Rami et al., 2008; Tian et al., 2010;
Uchiyama et al., 2008). In the nervous system, although
moderate autophagy has been thought to have neuroprotection generally (Gabryel et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012),
excess autophagic activity in brain ischemia often promotes
neuronal cell death (Chu, 2008; Uchiyama et al., 2008).
Applying autophagic inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or
down-regulating autophagy-related protein 7 (Atg7) could
prevent ischemic neuronal death (Kubota et al., 2010; Puyal
et al., 2009; Uchiyama, 2001; Wen et al., 2008). Moreover the

128

protective effect of glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor
(GDNF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were suggested
to be associated with their autophagic inhibition in rat
stroke model (Shang et al., 2010). Another report also
suggested that enhance of autophagic ﬂux led to apoptosis
and autophagic cell death in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury
(Ginet et al., 2009).
Stroke is characterized by brain damage and even death
resulting from a reduction of cerebral blood ﬂow due to acute
nutrient and oxygen deprivation following glutamate release
and free radicals production, which is the worldwide main
cause of death and acquired adult disability. It is well
established that the physical and exercise therapies on
ischemic brain damage have the prophylactic and protective
effects in clinic guideline (Furie et al., 2011; Goldstein et al.,
2011). Both experimental and clinic studies have shown that
exercise training decreases stroke occurrence (Hu et al., 2000;
Lee et al., 2003; Lee et al., 1999), brain susceptibility, severity
of brain injury, as well as induces neuroprotection after
stroke (Ang et al., 2003; DeBow et al., 2003; Marin et al.,
2003; F. Zhang et al., 2011). However the mechanisms underlying this clinical relevant phenomenon cannot be fully
explained until now.
Exercise as an energetic challenge can engage some
adaptive stress-responses in neuronal cells, involving neurotrophic factors expression, mitochondrial biogenesis and
degradation, protein chaperones, which are associated with
autophagy tightly. Moreover the death-signaling mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), p38 can also mediate
autophagy in response to stress and chemo-treatment
(Sridharan et al., 2011; Sui et al., 2013). Decreasing activation
of p38 has negatively inﬂuenced on autophagic induction,
although there are still controversies in certain functions
of p38.
A recent report showed that autophagy could be induced
by stroke (Shang et al., 2010), and other studied further
showed that autophagy was activated with a peak at the
ﬁrst day of reperfusion after ischemia (Ginet et al., 2009;
Tian et al., 2010), and gradually decreased at the third and
sixth day (Tian et al., 2010). Mammalian p62/SQSTM1 (also
known as p62) as one of autophagy receptors, is involved in
the autophagic machinery and elicits autophagosome formation, which is required for autophagic degradation
(Komatsu et al., 2007). The protein p62 is associated with
autophagosomes and degraded in autophagic process
(Pankiv et al., 2007), which therefore can be used as a
marker to study autophagy (Shvets et al., 2008). Some
studies also reported that p62 could locate to mitochondria
(Seibenhener et al., 2013) and mediate induction of mitophagy (mitochondrial autophagy) (Li et al., 2014; Webster
et al., 2013). Furthermore, the peak of cleaved casepase-3
was also observed at the third day in the same study (Tian
et al., 2010), showing apoptosis cascade was activated at
that time.
Nevertheless, there were few studies that directly focused
on the autophagic neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemic
injury. Thus in the present study, we have tried to understand whether exercise pretreatment and p38 inhibition had
an inﬂuence on autophagic process after cerebral ischemia,
contributing to their neuroprotection.

Results

2.1.
Exercise pretreatment inhibits autophagic process and
activates ERK cell-survival pathway after ischemia
To investigate the effect of exercise pretreatment on autophagy, we detected the levels of p62 at the third day after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Fig. 1A
showed p62 could be detected in all of the four groups,
however a signiﬁcant higher band intensity for p62 was in
the exercise pretreatment group after MCAO (above 5 times
than in the only MCAO group, Po0.05, Fig. 1B). Extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is one of the major
cell-survival and proliferation pathways. The activation of
the ERK pathway mediates the promotion of cell survival and
proliferation (Lai et al., 2013; Lavoie et al., 1996; Whitmarsh
and Davis, 2000). Therefore we examined the levels of
phosphorylatied ERK1/2 after ischemic injury. We found out
that phosphor-ERK1/2 in the exercise MCAO group was
signiﬁcantly higher than in the only MCAO group (po0.05,
Fig. 1A and B). These data showed that exercise pretreatment
could suppress autophagy and promote cell survival after
cerebral ischemia.

2.2.
Inhibiting the activation of p38 suppresses autophagy
and reduces brain infarction after ischemic injury
We also investigated the autophagic feature and neuroprotective effect of inhibition of p38 phosphorylation in rat
MCAO model, through the application of p38 inhibitor SB
239063 in vivo. The band intensity for p62 in the p38inhibitor-application MCAO group was signiﬁcantly higher
than in the only MCAO group, being similar to the patterns of
the phosphorylatied-ERK1/2 (po0.05, Fig. 2A and B). These
data suggested that the inhibition of p38 phosphorylation as
well as exercise pretreatment could suppress autophagy and
promote cell survival after cerebral ischemia.
After reperfusion, there were signiﬁcantly lower brain
infarct volumes in the MCAO groups treated with preexercise and the p38 inhibitor than in the only MCAO group
(Fig. 3). These above data showed that exercise pretreatment
and p38 inhibition suppressed autophagy, provided neuroprotection and improved outcome of cerebral ischemia
injury.

Discussion

Autophagy plays an important role in degradation of normal
cells in energy starvation via segregation and degradation of
damaged or unwanted cytoplasmic constituents. Accumulating evidences showed that autophagy involved in the pathological process of cerebral ischemia and led to autophagic
death of neuronal cells (Wang et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2008).
The inhibition of autophagy could attenuate the neurodegenerative damage following focal cerebral ischemia (Xing et al.,
2012), which was a promising strategy in the treatment of
ischemic stroke (Puyal et al., 2009), although there are still
conﬂicts in the role of autophagy in the neuroprotective

effect. A series studies on neuroprotective strategies revealed
suppressed autophagy (Cui et al., 2013), but some other
studies appeared opposite tendencies (Chauhan et al., 2011;
Park et al., 2009; Sheng et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012), which
might due to the difference of cerebral ischemia rodent
models and to the phase-dependent impact of autophagy
on cell survival (Zhang et al., 2013). Autophagy may play dual
roles during ischemia and reperfusion: protective during
ischemia while detrimental during reperfusion (Matsui et al.,
2007; Wei et al., 2012).
In our current study, the increased level of p62 showed
exercise preconditioning restrained autophagy. Since less
volumes of brain infarction in the pre-exercised MCAO group
indicated the exercise-induced neuroprotection improved
outcome of experimental stroke, which was consistent with
previous studies (Ding et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2008; He et al.,
2014; Jia et al., 2009; Liebelt et al., 2010). Suppression of
autophagy induced by exercise preconditioning may be a
novel target to rescued degenerative neurons after ischemia
and reperfusion injury. However, He and colleagues revealed
the up-regulation of autophagy in response to exercise preconditioning in physiological conditions (He et al., 2012), but
whether exercise-induced autophagy mediates neuroprotective effects remains unclear. The enhanced autophagy during
exercise preconditioning may generate adaptive stressresponse, which may induce the resistance to excessive
autophagy after stroke or other neurological diseases, similar
to that in ischemic preconditioning. The role of autophagy in
exercise preconditioning during ischemia injury remains
unclear and needs further investigation.
What correlate neuroprotective exercise preconditioning with
regulation of phase-dependent autophagy? Since exercise preconditioning is a systemic intervention, the connection is extremely complicated. In the present study, we investigated the role
of p38 Erk signal pathway, a classical cell signal pathway to
regulate cell proliferation and apoptosis and to maintain cell
morphology and biological function. Exercise preconditioning
up-regulated the level of p62 and promoted the phosphorylation
of Erk. Simultaneously, the application of p38 phosphorylation
inhibitor improved the phosphorylation of Erk, up-regulated
the level of p62 and reduced the brain infarct volume, as similar
as exercise preconditioning did. It was implied that p38 pathway

might connect exercise preconditioning with autophagy inhibition after cerebral ischemia. Generally, p38 has a dual role in the
autophagy regulation (Webber and Tooze, 2010), and plays either
the positive or negative role in the control of autophagy
(Sridharan et al., 2011; Sui et al., 2013). Nevertheless, since
exercise preconditioning is a recognized neuroprotective strategy
in ischemic stroke, inhibition of p38 phosphorylation induced by
exercise after cerebral ischemia, particularly during the reperfusion injury, may be the very upstream signal and control of
autophagy, which needs more sufﬁcient and determinative
evidences in our further studies.
In conclusion, exercise preconditioning and p38 inhibition
may alleviate brain injury after ischemic stroke via suppression
of autophagic cell death. Autophagy suppression may be a
novel strategy for stroke treatment, to rescue degenerative CNS
cells in ischemic penumbra and improve stroke outcome.

Experimental procedures

All experiments were approved by the Animal Experimental
Committee of Fudan University and performed in accordance
with the recommendations of the NIH Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals.

4.1.

Animals

Adult Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 250–300 g), purchased from
the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, were housed separately under a 12:12-h light/
dark cycle with water and food available ad libitum.

4.1.1.

For exercise pretreatment

Animals were randomly assigned to four groups, including
the non-exercise sham group, the exercise sham group, the
non-exercise MCAO group, and the exercise MCAO group.
After adaptation training, rats in exercise groups were trained
on an electric treadmill (DSPT-202 Type 5-Lane Treadmill;
Litai Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) at the speed of 20 m/min,
lasting 30 min/day for 2 weeks, as indicated in our previous
study (Yang et al., 2012). Simultaneously, rats in the nonexercise groups remained sedentary.

4.1.2.

For the inhibition of p38 kinase

Animals were randomly assigned to three groups, including
the only MCAO group, the pre-exercised MCAO group, and the
p38 inhibition group. The treatment of the pre-exercised
group was the same as described above. The dose of SB
239063 (Sigma-Aldrich) was 5 mg/kg (Barone et al., 2001), and
administered orally in acidiﬁed 0.5% tragacanth 60 min before
the operation of the stroke model. Acidiﬁed 0.5% tragacanth
was administered orally as a control in the only MCAO and
pre-exercised MCAO groups at the same time point.

4.2.
Transient cerebral focal ischemia (transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion, tMCAO)
All animal surgeries were performed by Z.H., who was
blinded to the groups. Rats were anesthetized with the
intraperitoneal administration of 360 mg/kg of chloral
hydrate, and they underwent surgery for left middle cerebral
artery (MCA) occlusion for 90 min followed by reperfusion, as
previously described (Longa et al., 1989). We used laser
Doppler ﬂowmetry to monitor the regional cerebral blood
ﬂow during the surgeries to guarantee the robustness of the
experimental stroke. Simultaneously, the rectal temperature
was maintained, while the blood pressure, heart rate and
blood gases were recorded before and after surgeries.

band intensity (optical density) was carried out on scanned
western blot images using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad)
from blots of independent experiments.

4.5.

Statistical analysis

We have used SPSS for Windows version (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) for statistical analysis. The quantitative data were
expressed as the mean7SEM. Parametric analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was performed on the data. Unpaired t-tests were
used for between-group comparisons of Western blotting
quantiﬁcation and brain infarct volumes. A p-value of less
than 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Determination of brain infarct volume

Acknowledgments
The animals were decapitated under 12% (v/v) chloral hydrate
anesthesia at 1 day after reperfusion. Brains were stored at
 20 1C for 10 min, and then six coronal sections (2 mm thick)
were dissected beginning midway between the anterior pole
and the optic chiasm and proceeding caudally. All sections
were immediately placed into a 2% TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) solution at 37 1C for 30 min and then ﬁxed
in 4% paraformaldehyde buffer. One day later, slices were
photographed, and imaging software (Adobe Photoshop 7.0)
was used to calculate the area of infarction. The total
infarction volume was measured as the sum of the infarcts
of each of the six sections. To minimize the error introduced
by edema, we used an indirect method to calculate the infarct
volumes:
Infarct volume ¼ contralateral hemisphere regionnon
infarcted region in the ipsilateral hemisphere

4.4.

Western blotting

Ipsilateral cortical tissues were harvested 3 days after MCAO
in the exercise pretreatment experiment or 1 day after
MCAO in the p38 inhibition experiment. Protein extracts
and western blotting were performed as previously
described (Q. Zhang et al., 2011, 2012). Equal amounts of
protein extracts were separated through 12% or 15% SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by
transfer onto PVDF membranes. Antibodies were used for
the detection of p62 (Cell Signaling Technology), p-ERK1/2
(Cell Signaling Technology), ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), and Actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Quantiﬁcation of
