that sulindac induced expression of Hsp 27, a marker of cell stress, in the ischemic penumbra

were also found in the protective molecules Akt and Bcl-2 in the ischemic penumbra and core
following sulindac administration. Conclusion: Our data indicate that administration of
sulindac results in decreased infarct size and that there is a central role for the molecular
chaperone Hsp 27, the pro-survival kinase Akt and the anti-apoptotic component Bcl-2 in
mediating these protective effects.

Introduction

Sulindac is a non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID) that
is capable of inhibiting cyclo-oxygenases (COX) 1 and 2 (Vane,
1971). In addition to its known anti-inﬂammatory activity there
have been numerous studies in recent years on the ability of
sulindac and its metabolites to act as potential anti-cancer
agents, based on their ability to slow the progression of colorectal polyps to colon cancer, as well as their ability to kill colon
and other cancer cells (Marchetti et al., 2009; Taketo, 1998).
Mammalian cells can respond to a variety of stresses such
as heat, cold, oxidative stress, metabolic disturbance, and
environmental toxins through necrotic or apoptotic cell death,
while increased expression and phosphorylation of heat
shock proteins such as Hsp 27 can protect cells against
cellular stress. Heat shock proteins (Hsp) commonly exhibit
molecular chaperone activity and also interact with a wide
variety of proteins to exert speciﬁc effects. In the central
nervous system, Hsp are induced in response to many injuries
including stroke, neurodegenerative disease, epilepsy, and
trauma. Hsp are highly conserved and under physiological
conditions act as molecular chaperones and/or have antiapoptotic activities. Two of the major heat shock proteins in
the brain are the 70 kDa Hsp (Hsp 70) and the 27 kDa Hsp (Hsp
27) (Stetler et al., 2009). Over expression of Hsp 27 has been
shown to reduce cortical damage after cerebral ischemia (Van
der Weerd et al., 2010). Hsp 27 is characterized by its
inducibility in both glial cells and neurons following a wide
range of noxious stimuli including ischemia, epileptic seizure
and hyperthermia (Van der Weerd et al., 2010).
Recent studies suggest that sulindac protects normal
cells against oxidative damage. Previous studies on the heart
suggested that sulindac protection against ischemic damage
occurs through an ischemic preconditioning mechanism.

Sulindac was found to induce iNOS and Hsp 27 in a protein
kinase C (PKC) dependent manner. It has been widely proposed that compounds that could precondition cells to
oxidative stress may have important therapeutic value, since
oxidative damage appears to play a major role in age related
diseases (Moench et al., 2009).
In the current study we employed a rodent model of
transient focal ischemia because this is very similar to human
stroke in terms of pathophysiology. The middle cerebral artery
(MCA) is the most commonly affected blood vessel in human
occlusive/ischemic stroke (Virtanen et al., 2003) and the MCA
is the artery most commonly targeted in rodent stroke models
(Macrae, 2011).
In the present study, we have examined the protective
effect of sulindac elicited by ischemia/reperfusion in the rat
brain subjected to MCA occlusion (MCAO) and we provide
evidence that sulindac is highly protective and exerts this
pro-survival effect through pathways associated with pharmacological preconditioning.

Analysis of TTC staining

Analysis of TTC staining of brain slices indicated a signiﬁcant
decrease in infarct size in sulindac treated animals at 4 mm,
6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm from the anterior pole (Fig. 1) (Po0.01;
2 way ANOVA).

2.2.
Sulindac induces Hsp 27 expression in an ischemic
model of stroke
A previous study has indicated that sulindac induces Hsp 27
in heart as part of a late phase preconditioning mechanism.
This was demonstrated using an ex vivo Langendorff myocardial ischemia model (Moench et al., 2009). Our current study
indicates that sulindac treated animals express enhanced
levels of Hsp 27 in penumbra and core of the ischemic area
of the stroke model (left side) on day-3 (Fig. 2A) and day-11
(Fig. 2B) after vessel occlusion. Quantiﬁcation of western blots
by densitometry showed approximately a 2–3 fold increase in
Hsp 27 expression on day-3 (Fig. 2A) and a 9 fold increase in
Hsp 27 expression on day-11 (Fig. 2B) after sulindac treatment.

ipsilateral hemisphere volume and values are means7SE of
10 experiments for MCAO and MCAO plus Sulindac.

Activation of Hsp 27 and Akt

In several cell types Hsp 27 has been shown to modulate
apoptosis by control of Akt activation. A previous investigation has identiﬁed Hsp 27 as an Akt substrate that dissociates
from Akt upon phosphorylation (Rane et al., 2003). This study
demonstrated that disruption of the interaction between Hsp
27 and Akt impairs Akt activation, leading to an enhanced
rate of constitutive neutrophil apoptosis (Rane et al., 2003;
Rane and Klein 2009). Furthermore, activation of Akt by Hsp
27 has been found to be necessary for cell survival. In the
present study Akt is activated after ischemia. The sulindac
treated groups show greater than 3-fold Akt activation in the
penumbra of the ischemic model of stroke compared to the

increase in the core at day 3 after vessel occlusion (Fig. 3A).
At day 11 after vessel occlusion the sulindac treated group
shows a greater than 2-fold increase in Akt in the penumbra
compared to the untreated group and an approximately
2-fold increase in the core compared to the untreated group
(Fig. 3B). The sulindac treated groups show greater than
3-fold of phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt) in the penumbra and core
of the ischemic model of stroke compared to the penumbra of
the untreated group at day 3 after vessel occlusion (Fig. 4).

2.4.
Up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and
down regulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bak
The Bcl-2 families of proto-oncogenes encode speciﬁc proteins that regulate apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli.
Bcl-2 expression is induced in the brain by ischemia consistent with the concept that this protein could play a role as an
endogenous neuro-protectant (Chen et al., 1997). This standpoint is supported by the observation that Bcl-2 protects
neurons against ischemia when over-expressed either using

94

brain research 1576 (2014) 91–99

PUMA, a p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis and a
BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 protein family, is required for
p53-dependent and independent forms of apoptosis. PUMA
localizes to mitochondria and interacts with anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL or pro-apoptotic Bax/Bak in response to
death stimuli (Steckley et al., 2007; Niizuma et al., 2009; Hong
et al., 2010; Kuroki et al., 2009). PUMA has been shown to upregulate Bax/Bak expression and induce neuronal apoptosis.
Notably in our analysis while PUMA itself was not differentially regulated between conditions (Fig. 6B), measurement of
the ratio of pro-survival Bcl-2 to pro-death PUMA (Bcl-2/
PUMA) on day 3 demonstrated a clear 3.5-fold up-regulation
following sulindac treatment in the ischemic penumbra
(Fig. 6D).

Sulindac up regulates GRP78 in ischemic core and
penumbra
Fig. 4 – P-Akt protein level in penumbra and core of ischemic

a viral vector or in transgenic animals (Linnik et al., 1995).
Hence in this investigation we evaluated the effect of sulindac on expression of anti-apoptotic markers in relation to cell
survival. Our analysis indicated that with sulindac treatment
Bcl-2 expression increased at day 3 in the ischemic penumbra
by approximately 2-fold relative to the untreated group
(Fig. 5A). At day 11 after vessel occlusion the sulindac treated
group showed a greater than 2-fold increase in Bcl-2 in the
ischemic penumbra relative to the untreated group and
showed a greater than 2.5-fold increase in Bcl-2 in the
ischemic core relative to the untreated group (Fig. 5B).
Pro-apoptotic members are divided into the multi-BH
domain “effectors” and the BH3- only proteins. The effectors
comprise Bax and Bak. They share BH1-3 domains and have a
transmembrane domain (Henshall and Engel, 2013). The Bcl-2
protein is known to promote cell survival while Bax, BAD,
and/or Bak, all pro-apoptotic proteins, can translocate from
the cytosol into the outer mitochondrial membrane after
brain ischemia leads to apoptosis (Mohammad-Gharibani
et al., 2014). In our study, the sulindac treated group showed
a greater than 2.5-fold decrease in Bak in the ischemic
penumbra relative to the untreated group and showed a
greater than 2-fold decrease in Bak in the ischemic core
relative to the untreated group on day-3 (Fig. 6A).

2.5.
Up-regulation of Bcl2/Bak and Bcl-2/PUMA ratio in
ischemic penumbra and core
Our result indicates that measurement of the ratio of prosurvival Bcl-2 to pro-death Bak on day 3 demonstrated a
clear 3.5-fold up-regulation in penumbra and 1.5-fold upregulation in core following sulindac treatment (Fig. 6C).

Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is the members of the
heat shock protein family that act as the molecular chaperones in the folding and assembly of newly synthesized
proteins within ER. Experimental evidences have indicated
that up-regulation of GRP78 prevents neuronal damage
induced by ER stress, and the increase in GRP78 expression
may correlate to the degree of neuroprotection (Ye et al.,
2013). Up regulation of GRP 78 leads to correction of protein
mis-folding, and its protective roles are witnessed by the
in vitro observations that GRP 78-depleted cells exhibited
increased susceptibility to tunicamycin treatment and excitotoxicity (Morris et al., 1997; Yu et al., 1999; Xu et al., 2006).
Our studies show that up-regulation of GRP 78 is speciﬁcally
elicited in the sulindac treated ischemic penumbra on day 3
(Fig. 7A) and day 11(Fig. 7B) compared to the “no-drug”
ischemic penumbra. Sulindac treated ischemic core and
control ischemic core do not differ signiﬁcantly in GRP 78
expression on day 3 but on day 11 we found a signiﬁcant
increase in GRP 78 expression in sulindac treated ischemic
core compared to “no-drug” ischemic core (Fig. 7B).

Discussion

The aim of the current study was to investigate the neuroprotective role of sulindac in the rat MCAO model of focal
cerebral ischemia. The studies presented here show that
sulindac can protect neurons in the brain against oxidative
damage resulting from ischemia and reperfusion. A key
ﬁnding of the study demonstrated increased Hsp 27 expression following sulindac treatment. Several studies indicate
that Hsp 27 has an anti-apoptotic role (Concannon et al.,
2003) as well as a molecular chaperone role (Gabai and
Sherman, 2002) in ischemia. Overexpression of Hsp 27 is also
reported to decrease the amount of apoptosis-inducing factor
(AIF), which is released by mitochondria in a caspase
independent pathway of cell death (Stetler et al., 2008).
Overexpression of wild-type heat shock protein 27 or a nonphosphorylable heat shock protein 27 mutant protects
against ischemia/reperfusion injury in a transgenic
mouse model (Hollander et al., 2004). Hsp 27 is also reported
to protect the heart against myocardial infarction (Efthymiou

et al., 2004). Our study on MCAO in rats indicates
that sulindac induces Hsp 27 expression on days 3 and 11.
There are certain key studies in the literature suggesting that
sulindac can protect cells against free radical damage. However to date no previous studies show a prolonged protective
effect of sulindac in an in vivo model of cerebral ischemia.
Hsp 27 has been shown to protect cells in vitro by interfering with stress-triggered apoptotic cascades (Badin et al.,
2006). Both Akt and Hsp 27 are reported to promote cell
survival by inhibiting apoptosis. Introduction of anti-Hsp 27
antibodies into neutrophils was found to block Hsp 27's
interaction with Akt thus inhibiting Akt activation indicating
that Hsp 27 association with the Akt signaling complex is
necessary for Akt activation in these cells (Rane et al., 2003).
Hsp 27 has been identiﬁed in several systems as a “scaffold”
protein, capable of leading to the activation of pro-survival
signaling molecules such as MK2 and Akt (Stetler et al., 2009).
If the Akt–Hsp 27 interaction is intact, then upon stimulation
of cells with a ligand, Akt translocates to the membrane and
is fully activated by phosphorylation on Thr308 and Ser473 by
PDK1 and PDK2 respectively (Rane and Klein 2009).
Sulindac treated penumbra showed greater Bcl-2 expression and lower Bak/PUMA expression compared to the control
ischemic penumbra. Bcl-2 is known to play a central role in
regulating neuronal survival (Davies, 1995). Bcl-2-associated X
protein (Bax) is also required for oxidative stress induced cell
death and PUMA plays a dominant role in regulating Bax/Bak
activation and neuronal apoptosis (Steckley et al., 2007).
Hence sulindac exerts its neuroprotective role by inhibiting
apoptosis via increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bak/
PUMA expression in the ischemic penumbra.
GRP 78 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident molecular chaperone whose expression serves as a good marker of
ER stress (Ma and Hendershot, 2001). Although the ER is

implicated in neuronal degeneration in some situations, its
role in delayed neuronal cell death after ischemia remains
uncertain. However in previous studies it was shown that ER
stress is reduced by ischemic preconditioning and that ER
stress reduction by preconditioning was the result of ER
molecular chaperone induction (Hayashi et al., 2003).
When severe ischemia is induced increased levels of
unfolded proteins occur in the ER lumen and this is associated with increases in ER chaperones such as GRP78. In the
present study up-regulation of GRP78 in the sulindac treated
core and penumbra at day 3 and day 11 may contribute to
a protective response in the same way as was reported
in previous reports on preconditioning against ER stress in
delayed neuronal death (Davies, 1995).
In summary, Hsp 27 controls apoptosis by regulating Akt
activation (Rane et al., 2003). Numerous studies have demonstrated that up-regulation of Hsp27 is protective for neurons
under ischemic conditions. Therefore sulindac may act therapeutically in cerebral ischemia through its effects on Hsp 27
and Akt. As Hsp 27 and Akt prevent apoptosis it is likely that
the elevated levels of the anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 in the
current study will further augment the pro-survival effect of
sulindac. An enhanced expression of Grp78 in the sulindac
treated ischemic core and ischemic penumbra implies that
sulindac protects through preconditioning and is consistent
with previous studies on ischemic preconditioning showing an enhanced level of GRP78 expression and protection
against slow neuronal death.
Although other NSAIDs may show protection in focal
brain ischemia, some of these may act primarily by antiinﬂammatory actions, whereas sulindac has been shown to
function in several capacities: as a catalytic antioxidant, or
an anti-inﬂammatory agent or as a preconditioning agent
(Moench et al., 2009; Etienne et al., 2003). Previous studies on

brain research 1576 (2014) 91–99

the NSAID, parecoxib (Ye et al., 2013) indicate that it protects
against apoptosis in a rat MCAO model via GRP78 activation
similarly to what we observed for sulindac. Interestingly
parecoxib decreased CHOP activity providing evidence that
the drug decreased ER stress responses. The NSAID ﬂurbiprofen (Sun et al., 2011) was recently shown to protect against
focal ischemia at 24 h post-occlusion through up-regulation
of pro-survival BCl-2 family members and through increased
p-Akt expression. In our own investigation increased p-Akt
levels point to a pro-survival action concurrent with Hsp27
activation. Such increases in Akt and p-Akt are known to be
anti-apoptotic and may also be consistent with the action of
sulindac occurring through established preconditioning
mechanisms (Prasad et al., 2011).
The protective effect we have observed with sulindac in
cerebral ischemia is contrary to several studies that NSAIDs
cause increased risk of stroke and heart attack (Hennekens
and Borzak, 2008). It should be noted that in the rat feeding
experiments described in this study the daily dose of sulindac
(0.2 mg/day) was only 10–15%, on a weight basis, compared to
the doses taken clinically as an anti-inﬂammatory agent.
Hence sulindac at the low dose administered in this study is
likely to be very valuable as a neuro-protective agent against
oxidative stress in cerebral ischemia.

Experimental Procedure

4.1.

Experimental design for day-3 and day-11:

Group 1: sham animals (n ¼5),
Group 2: “no-drug” ischemic untreated animals (MCAO)
(n¼ 5),
Group 3: treated animals with MCAO (pre and postsulindac inj.) (n¼ 5).

4.2.
Preparation for surgery and establishment of
transient model of stroke
Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing 250–300 g) were
subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) according to standard procedures. Rats were anaesthetized initially
with Isoﬂurane and then during surgery with Ketamine
80 mg/kg and xylazine 20 mg/kg (intraperitoneal injection)
and were allowed spontaneous respiration throughout surgical procedure. The body temperature was maintained at
37.5 1C using a heating pad connected to rectal probe (CMA
450) throughout surgery. After attaining deep anesthesia, hair
was removed and the surgical area prepared aseptically. The
Laser Doppler ﬂow (LDF) (Perimed Inc, OH, USA) was positioned on the skull above the cerebral cortex of the left
hemisphere in the supply territory of the MCA. After attaching the Doppler probe, rats were gently turned upside down
to create the MCAO model in the supine position. Rat cerebral
blood ﬂow (CBF) was monitored continuously with a 1.0 s
time constant from before the surgery for MCAO. A ventral
midline cervical incision was made. Under a surgical scope,
the left common carotid artery (CCA) along with external
carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were

97

exposed via a midline pretracheal incision. The vagus and
sympathetic nerves were separated carefully from the artery.
The external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated 2 mm distal to
the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. The internal
carotid artery was dissected distally to expose the origin of
the pterygopalatine artery (PPA). The common carotid artery
was then ligated temporarily 5–10 mm proximal to its bifurcation and the pterygopalatine artery was ligated close to
its origin with a 5-0 nylon suture (Chen et al., 2008). The
micro-incision was made on ECA and monoﬁlament suture
uncoated nylon 4.0 inserted through ECA to ICA. The ﬁlament
was advanced 18–22 mm from the carotid artery bifurcation
into the internal carotid artery until there was slight resistance (O’Neill and Clemens, 2001). Reperfusion was accomplished by withdrawing the ﬁlament 2 h after MCAO (Popp
et al., 2009). CBF measured during surgery until 30 min after
reperfusion. The surgical wound was closed with 4-0 silk
suture. In sham-operated rats, rectal temperature and Laser
doppler ﬂow (LDF) was monitored continuously for 2 h after
placement of the intraluminal suture in the ECA, without
advancing it to the point of causing ischemia (2 mm past the
carotid bifurcation). (n ¼5 per group) (Srinivasan and Sharma,
2011).

4.3.

Preparation and dosage of sulindac drug

50 mg sulindac powder (sigma) is dissolved in 1 ml of 500 mM
Tris (pH 8) solution. The drug was given via subcutaneous
injection (0.2 mg/day) 2 days pre-surgery (Moench et al., 2009)
and every 24 h post surgery until sacriﬁce on day 3 or 11.

4.4.
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) assessment
of lesion size
Rats were euthanized 3 or 11 days after surgery. The brain
was quickly removed and sectioned into 2 mm thick slices
starting at the frontal pole using a Brain Matrix Slicer (Zivic
instruments, PA, USA). Slices were immersed in 2% TTC (J.C.
Baker, India) in a Petri dish and incubated at 37 1C for 5 min.
TTC, a water soluble salt, is reduced by mitochondrial
dehydrogenases to formazan, a red, lipid-soluble compound
that turns normal tissue deep red (Bederson et al. 1986; Rich
et al., 2001). Thus, reduced TTC staining identiﬁes regions of
diminished mitochondrial function in the ischemic tissue
(Li et al., 1997). To assess lesion volume, TTC-stained slices
(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mm from the frontal pole) were
scanned and analyzed by Image-J analysis software (public
domain software: URL: http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nihimage/).
Lesion volume was determined as the percent of the total
ipsilateral hemispheric volume and was calculated as:
½ðVC VLÞ=VC100
where VC is the volume of the contralateral hemisphere and
VL is the volume of non-lesioned tissue in the lesioned
hemisphere (Mohammad-Gharibani et al., 2014; Gharibani
et al., 2013). Then, these sections were compared in different
treated and untreated animal groups.

Sample collection for western blot analysis

After TTC experiment, while the sections were on ice, the
lesioned part of the left hemisphere (Core and Penumbra)
(Gharibani et al., 2013) and the right hemisphere (identical
parts) were quickly dissected on dry ice and homogenized in
Lysis buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl,
2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Triton-X-100, 1:100 dilution of mammalian protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and
protease inhibitor (Buddhala et al., 2012) for immunoblotting.
Protein concentrations of each sample solution were determined with a Bradford protein assay, and samples were
stored at  80 1C until use. Protein samples were separated
by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes.
Membranes were blocked with 5% milk for 1 h and then
probed overnight with Hsp 27, Hsp 70, GRP 78, Bcl-2, PUMA
and Akt(1:1000) antibodies, washed 3  20 min in TBS-T containing 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated anti-Rabbit IgG (1:3000) for 90 min.
Bound antibody was visualized with the ECL system (Amersham) (Buddhala et al., 2012; Mohammad-Gharibani et al.,
2013). Membranes were then stripped and probed for GAPDH
to conﬁrm equal protein loading. Size and density of
the bands were measured by Image-J analysis software, and
signals were quantiﬁed relative to the signal intensity
for GAPDH.
