Abstract
Transforming growth factor-bs (TGF-bs) regulate cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. TGF-bs bind to type I
(TGF-bRI) and II receptors (TGF-bRII), which are transmembrane kinase receptors, and an accessory type III receptor (TGFbRIII). TGF-b may utilize another type I receptor, activin-like kinase receptor (Alk1). TGF-b is neuroprotective in the middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke. Recently, we reported the expression pattern of TGF-b1-3 after MCAO. To
establish how TGF-bs exert their actions following MCAO, the present study describes the induction of TGF-bRI, RII, RIII and
Alk1 at 24 h, 72 h and 1 mo after transient 1 h MCAO as well as following 24 h permanent MCAO using in situ hybridization
histochemistry. In intact brain, only TGF-bRI had significant expression: neurons in cortical layer IV contained TGF-bRI. At
24 h after the occlusion, no TGF-b receptors showed induction. At 72 h following MCAO, all four types of TGF-b receptors
were induced in the infarct area, while TGF-bRI and RII also appeared in the penumbra. Most cells with elevated TGF-bRI
mRNA levels were microglia. TGF-bRII co-localized with both microglial and endothelial markers while TGF-bRIII and Alk1
were present predominantly in endothels. All four TGF-b receptors were induced within the lesion 1 mo after the occlusion.
In particular, TGF-bRIII was further induced as compared to 72 h after MCAO. At this time point, TGF-bRIII signal was
predominantly not associated with blood vessels suggesting its microglial location. These data suggest that TGF-b receptors
are induced after MCAO in a timely and spatially regulated fashion. TGF-b receptor expression is preceded by increased TGFb expression. TGF-bRI and RII are likely to be co-expressed in microglial cells while Alk1, TGF-bRII, and RIII in endothels
within the infarct where TGF-b1 may be their ligand. At later time points, TGF-bRIII may also appear in glial cells to
potentially affect signal transduction via TGF-bRI and RII.

b RI and RII [9]. Although TGF-b RIII has a short intracellular
domain, it presents TGF-bs to TGF-b RII [10,11] and may bind
some other ligands including inhibin [12]. TGF-b receptor III is
particularly important for the recognition of TGF-b2, which binds
poorly to the TGF-b receptor [13]. More recently, another type I
receptor, activin-like receptor kinase 1 (Alk1) was shown to signal
TGF-b1, and -b3 in addition to bone morphogenic protein 9 [14].
It has also been demonstrated that the actions through Alk1 are
often different from, sometimes even antagonistic to those exerted
by TGF-b RI [15].
The knowledge available on the TGF-bs and their receptors in
the brain is also rapidly accumulating. Immunohistochemical
studies suggested that in the intact brain, TGF-b1 is present only
in choroid plexus epithelial and meningeal cells while the
distribution of TGF-b2 and -b3 are more widespread [16,17]. In
turn, TGF-b1 is induced in response to injury including the focal
ischemia elicited by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), an
animal model of stroke [18,19]. We recently demonstrated by
using in situ hybridization histochemistry that TGF-b2 and -b3

Introduction
Receptors of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b)
superfamily are receptor serine kinases [1,2]. Their canonical
signal transduction pathway includes SMAD proteins, which need
to be phosphorylated to exert their effects within the nucleus [3].
Based on their role and sequence homology, the receptors of the
TGF-b superfamily can be divided as type I receptors, which can
phosphorylate SMAD proteins, type II receptors, required for the
action of type I receptors, and accessory receptors that may play a
role in recruiting the ligands [4]. TGF-b receptor I (TGF-b RI), or
activin-like receptor kinase 5, was initially recognized as the
receptor of all 3 types of TGF-bs, TGF-b1, -b2, and -b3, which
are all dimeric ligands [5,6]. The ligands bind to TGF-b receptor
II (TGF-b RII), which in turn forms the functional receptor with
TGF-b RI and phosphorylates it [7]. A functional receptor is a
heterotetramer consisting of 2 TGF-b RI, and 2 TGF-b RII [8]. In
addition, TGF-b receptor III (TGF-b RIII), or betaglycan, has the
ability to influence the TGF-b receptor complex formed by TGF-

drinking water ad libitum. Rats were kept 3 per cage at a
temperature of 2261uC. Rats were anaesthetized with an
intramuscular injection (0.2 ml/300 g body weight) of anesthetics
containing ketamine (60 mg/ml) and xylazine (8 mg/ml) for
middle cerebral artery occlusion, transcardial perfusion, or
decapitation.

can also be induced by MCAO albeit with a different temporal
and spatial pattern. While TGF-b1 appears first in the penumbra
and later within the infarct in microglial cells, TGF-b2 is induced
in neurons in the penumbra and in the intact ipsilateral cerebral
cortex away from the lesion [20]. TGF-bs were shown to be
neuroprotective following MCAO [21]. In addition to neuroprotection, TGF-bs may also participate in regenerative processes as
they increase adult [22] and promote neuronal cell fate of cortical
and hippocampal progenitors [23]. TGF-b1 administered into the
brain reduced the infarct size in experimental models of ischemia
[24–26] while antagonizing the endogenous action of TGF-b1
with the injection of a soluble TGF-b type II receptor, which binds
TGF-b1 and prevents its biological actions, resulted in a dramatic
increase in infarct area [27]. Recently, small molecule inhibitors of
TGF-b signaling became available and are used in clinical trials
[28]. Neuroprotective actions of some of these novel drugs have
also been suggested [29]. However, it remains to be established
which receptors are involved in these actions. A study using RNase
protection assays demonstrated the presence of mRNA of TGF-b
RI, RII, and RIII in different brain regions [30]. Immunohistochemical studies reported that TGF-b RI and RII are present in
the intact brain both in neurons and glial cells [17,31].
Furthermore, induction in the levels of TGF-b RI and RII
immunoreactivities were found in response to focal [32,33], and
global ischemia [34]. TGF-b RIII was also found in the brain, with
abundance in reproductive regions [35]. In contrast, Alk1 was
generally confined to endothelial cells [36] with an increased
expression by vascular injury [37]. In addition, Alk1 may also be
present in neurons [38]. The neuroprotective functions of TGF-bs
suggest the involvement of TGF-b receptors in the tissue response
to focal hypoxia. Such involvement may include gene expressional
changes whose identification will contribute to our understanding
of the mechanisms of actions by TGF-bs. Therefore, we addressed
the following questions in the present study: 1. How are mRNAs of
TGF-b RI, RII, RIII, and Alk1 distributed following 1 h MCAO
and permanent 24 h MCAO in the rat brain? 2. What is the time
course of induction of mRNA of TGF-b RI, RII, RIII, and Alk1
following MCAO? 3. Which cell types express the different
subtypes of TGF-b receptor following MCAO? In situ hybridization histochemistry, which we used previously to describe the
distribution of TGF-bs in response to MCAO [20] and its
combination with immunolabeling for neuronal (NeuN), astrocyte
(S100), microglial (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 Iba1), endothelial cells (von Willebrand factor – vWF), and smooth
muscle cells (alpha smooth muscle actin – alpha-SMA) markers
were applied to identify the cells that express the different TGF-b
receptors in the ischemic rat brain.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion
Focal ischemia was induced using a modified intraluminal
suture method of the described previously [39]. Briefly, left
common, internal and external carotid arteries were exposed
through a midline neck incision and were carefully dissected from
the surrounding tissues under an operating microscope. After
electrocoagulation of the external and common carotid arteries, a
3–0 silicon rubber-coated monofilament (Doccol, Redlands, CA)
was inserted through the common carotid artery into the internal
carotid artery 18 to 20 mm beyond the carotid bifurcation to the
base of the middle cerebral artery. The pterygopalatine branch of
the internal carotid artery was exposed before the insertion in
order to avoid the filament turning into it. An atraumatic
aneurysm clip (Codman, Johnson and Johnson, Le Locle, NE,
Switzerland) was placed on the internal carotid artery to prevent
bleeding. The clip and the monofilament were removed 1 h later
(except for 24 h permanent MCAO), and the incision was sutured.
The rats were sacrificed 24 h, 72 h, or 1 month after the
beginning of the reperfusion and their brains were dissected and
cut coronally at the level of the bregma. The anterior parts of the
brains were stained with 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) and the posterior parts frozen for in situ hybridization
histochemistry.

Allocation of operated animals into experimental groups
Six rats were used in each of the following 4 groups: (a)
dissection at 24 h after 1 h MCAO, (b) rats with a permanent
MCAO dissected 24 h after the occlusion, dissection at (c) 72 h,
and (d) 1 month after 1 h MCAO. Some additional animals were
perfused for immunohistochemistry. The number of perfused
animals included 4-4 rats sacrificed 24 h, 72 h, and 1 month after
1 h MCAO. A further 6 sham-operated rats were used (2 for each
time points, one freshly dissected and one perfused).

Probe preparation
Cerebral cortex was dissected from a fresh brain, quickly frozen
on dry ice, kept at 280uC before total mRNA was isolated using
Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. After diluting total RNA to 2 mg/ml,
RNA was treated with Amplification Grade DNase I (Invitrogen),
and cDNA was synthesized with a Superscript II reverse
transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After tenfold dilution, 2.5 ml of the resulting cDNA
was used as template in PCRs performed with iTaq DNA
polymerase (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) in total volumes
of 12.5 ml under the following conditions: 95uC for 3 minutes,
followed by 35 cycles of 95uC for 0.5 minutes, 60uC for
0.5 minutes, and 72uC for 1 minute. Primers were used at 300

B: TTTCAGCAGTGTGCAAGGAC and CATTTGGAGAATGCCACCTT). The calculated lengths of the PCR
products are 355 and 252 base pairs (bp) for TGF-b RI (663–
1017 and 2789–3040 bp of GenBank accession No.
NM_012775.2), 290 and 280 bp for TGF-b RII (1109–1398
and 1436–1715 bp of GenBank accession No. NM_031132.3), 366
and 331 bp for TGF-b RIII (1404–1769 and 3178–3508 bp of
GenBank accession No. NM_017256.1), and 345 and 306 bp for
Alk1 (1219–1563 and 3096–3401 bp of GenBank accession No.
NM_022441.2). The primers were chosen to generate probes that
do not overlap but recognize all known RNA species for the
particular gene. PCR products were run on gel, and pictures were
taken with a digital camera. Then, the PCR products were
purified from gel, inserted into TOPO TA cloning vectors
(Invitrogen), and transformed chemically into competent bacteria
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmids were
purified from five to seven colonies and applied as templates in
PCRs with specific primer pairs to select plasmids containing
specific inserts. A positive plasmid for each probe was applied as
template in PCRs, using primer pairs specific for the probe and
also containing T7 RNA polymerase recognition site (GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGAATTGGGTA) added to the
reverse primers and T3 RNA polymerase recognition site
(AATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAACAAAAGCTGG) added
to the forward primers. At the end, the identities of the cDNA
probes were verified by sequencing them with T7 primers.

MCAO, rats at 72 h and 1 mo following 1 h MCAO. Dark-field
photomicrographs were taken of the sections at 3-3 positions from
within the lesions, the penumbra and the adjacent intact tissue
outside of the lesion using a 406 objective. The density of
autoradiography grains within 4006400 mm areas (0.16 mm2) of
coronal brain sections was counted, the averages of the 3 positions
were considered as one value. The pixel number of white area
(lighter than an arbitrary grayness used for all the images) was
calculated for the images using ImageJ 1.47v (National Institutes of
Health, USA) software. The values were used to quantify the
mRNA levels. The mRNA levels at the different time points were
compared using one-way ANOVA. The mRNA levels at different
locations and time points were compared using two-way ANOVA.
The individual values were compared using Bonferroni’s multiple
comparison post-hoc tests.

Cresyl-violet staining
Alternative series of sections from the MCAO treated rats were
mounted consecutively on gelatin-coated slides and dried. Sections
were stained in 0.1% cresyl-violet dissolved in PB, then
differentiated in 96% ethanol containing acetic acid. Sections
were then dehydrated and coverslipped with Cytoseal 60
(Stephens Scientific).

Quantitation of the lesioned brain areas
A section with the largest apparent lesion was selected from
each brain. Its antero-posterior bregma coordinate was always
between +0.8 and 20.8 mm. These sections were labeled with
cresyl-violet (Nissl) staining as described above. Images of Nisslstained brain sections from each rat were obtained and areas of the
infarctions and the ipsilateral hemispheres were manually demarcated followed my measurement of the areas using ImageJ 1.47v
(National Institutes of Health, USA). The percentage of the infarct
area to the ipsilateral hemisphere was calculated.

In situ hybridization histochemistry
Brains of 27 rats (6 in all 4 groups and 1-1 sham operated) were
removed and the fresh tissue was quickly frozen on dry ice, and
kept at 280uC. Serial coronal sections (12 mm thick) were cut
using a cryostat from bregma level +4 mm to 26 mm [40],
mounted on positively charged slides (SuperfrostPlus, Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), dried, and stored at 280uC until use.
The brain sections were collected in such a way that consecutive
sections were mounted on 18 parallel slides. For in situ
hybridization, [35S]UTP-labeled riboprobes were generated from
the DNA probes containing T7 and T3 RNA polymerase
recognition sites using a MAXIscript transcription kit (Ambion,
Austin, TX). Antisense riboprobes were prepared using T7 RNA
polymerase while sense control probes were prepared using T3
RNA polymerase. The preparation of tissue was performed using
mRNAlocator Kit (Ambion), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For hybridization, we used 80 ml hybridization buffer
and labeled probes of 1 million DPM activity per slide. Tissue was
prepared using an mRNA-locator Kit (Ambion) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. For hybridization, we used 80 ml
hybridization buffer and 1 million DPM of labeled probe per slide.
Washing procedures included a 30 min incubation in RNase A,
followed by decreasing concentrations of sodium-citrate buffer
(pH = 7.4) at room temperature, and then at 65uC. After drying,
slides were dipped in NTB nuclear track emulsion (Eastman
Kodak, Rochester, NY), stored for 3 weeks at 4uC for autoradiography, developed with Kodak Dektol developer, fixed with
Kodak fixer, counterstained with Giemsa, and coverslipped with
Cytoseal 60 (Stephens Scientific, Riverdale, NJ, USA).

Tissue collection for immunolabeling
Rats (n = 15, 4 at each time point and 3 sham operated) were
deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with 150 ml saline
followed by 300 ml 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in phosphate
buffer (PB; pH = 7.4). Brains were removed and postfixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 24 h and then transferred to PB containing
20% sucrose for 2 days. Serial coronal brain sections were cut at
20 mm on a cryostat between 4.0 and 27.0 mm bregma levels.
Subsequently, the sections were processed for immunohistochemistry or for a combination of in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry. The brain sections were collected in such
a way that consecutive sections were mounted on 18 parallel slides.

Immunohistochemistry
Slide-attached sections were pretreated with 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 10 min followed by 1% bovine serum albumin in PB
containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature.
Then, parallel series of sections were placed in one of the following
primary antisera for 24 h at room temperature: mouse anti-NeuN
as a marker of neuronal nuclei (1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA,
cat. number: MAB377), mouse anti-S-100, as a marker of
astrocytes (1:5000 Sigma-Aldrich, cat. number: S2532), rabbit
anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) as a
marker of microglial cells (1:1000; Wako, cat. number: 019–

specificity of the antibodies used in the present study has been
validated previously by the companies using western blotting. In
addition, our own results also argue for specific labeling based on
the morphology of the labeled cells. After incubation in primary
antisera, the sections were washed, and incubated in either
biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000; Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) or anti-mouse secondary
antibody (1:1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), for
1 h followed by washes and incubation in avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex (1:500; Vector Laboratories) for 1 h.
Finally, the sections were treated with 0.06% DAB and 0.003%
H2O2 in Tris hydrochloride buffer (0.05 M, pH = 8.2) for 10 min,
and coverslipped with Cytoseal 60 (Stephens Scientific).

Combination of immunohistochemistry and in situ
hybridization histochemistry
Slide attached sections of perfused brains were first processed
for in situ hybridization, as described above. Thus, tightly bound
RNA-RNA pairs were already formed by the time immunohistochemistry was performed, immediately before dipping the slides
into autoradiographic emulsion. In addition, the solutions used for
perfusion and immunohistochemistry were prepared with DAPCtreated RNAse-free water, which ensured that the labeling
intensity of the in situ hybridization histochemistry did not
decrease significantly. The immunolabeling protocol was the same
as that used for single labeling immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity was visualized using DAB reactions, after which the in
situ hybridization procedure was continued by dipping the slides
into emulsion. Each double labeling experiment included controls,
which went through the double labeling procedure without
application of radioactive in situ hybridization probes. These
controls demonstrated that the DAB signal did not induce an
autoradiography signal.

Quantitative analysis of double labeling experiments
A cell was considered to express TGF-b receptor if the number
of autoradiography grains accumulated in a seemingly Gaussian
distribution around a center was at least 3 times higher than the
background level in an area corresponding to an average cell size
(a circle with a diameter of 25 mm). The background typically
contained 3–4 grains, but always less than 7 grains, per cell in the
in situ hybridization histochemistry. A TGF-b receptor-expressing
cell was considered immunopositive if at least half of the area of
the circle containing the accumulation of autoradiography grains
contained immunoreactivity for a particular marker. For quantitation, we counted the number of TGF-b receptor-expressing cells
and the number of double-labeled cells defined above (TGF-b

dissected brains (Fig. 1). TTC staining indicated successful lesion
for each brain involved in the study. Nissl staining of the sections
also demonstrated the extent of the lesion (Fig. S2). Moreover,
Nissl staining provided valuable information on the size of the
infarct area. The size of the lesion following 24 h after MCAO was
46.362.9% of the ipsilateral hemisphere measured in freshly
dissected brains. The size of the lesion was larger following
permanent than 1 h transient MCAO, the lesioned area accounted for 59.965.1% of the ipsilateral hemisphere. At 72 h, and even
more so at 1 mo following MCAO, the apparent size of the lesion
was reduced as compared to 24 h after MCAO (47.764.7% at
72 h and 35.362.8% at 1 month). It was also observed at these
time points that invading cells occupied the lesioned neural
tissue(Fig. S2).
We describe that mRNA of each type of TGF-b receptor
showed a specific topographical expression pattern in response to
focal ischemia ipsilateral to the lesion. In contrast, we never
observed alterations in mRNA expression in the contralateral side
of the brain (Fig. S1). However, the pattern of induction on the
lesion side changed with time after MCAO. The cell types
expressing the different types of TGF-b receptors were also
identified by co-localization with known cellular markers.

Histological analysis and image processing
The sections were examined using an Olympus BX60 light
microscope in both dark-field and bright-field. Images were
captured at 204862048 pixel resolution with a SPOT Xplorer
digital CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights,
MI) using a 46 objective for dark-field images, and 4–406
objectives for bright-field images. The contrast and sharpness of
the images were adjusted using the ‘‘levels’’ and ‘‘sharpness’’
commands in Adobe Photoshop CS 8.0. Full resolution was
maintained until the photomicrographs were printed, at which
point the images were adjusted to a resolution of 300 dpi.

Results
The basal expression level of TGF-b receptors was very low and
not topographically organized in the brain except for TGF-b RI,
which was abundant in the cerebral cortex, most peculiarly in
layer IV (Fig. S1). Sham operations did not induce any TGF-b
receptor mRNA or altered the pattern of basal expressions even in
brain areas supplied by the middle cerebral artery (Fig. S1). The
1 h MCAO we performed resulted in large lesions that included
large parts of the ipsilateral striatum and a considerable part of the
cortex. The lesion was visible using TTC staining as the infarct did
not show the red labeling characteristic of live tissue in freshly

layers as well as in the caudate putamen (striatum). Thus, the
density of TGF-b RI mRNA was higher in the penumbra than in
the intact brain tissue (2-way ANOVA for cortex and Bonferroni
posttest for 72 h: F = 32.99, t = 6.501, p,0.001; 2-way ANOVA
for striatum and Bonferroni posttest for 72 h: F = 441.6, t = 17.18,
p,0.001; Fig. 4A). An induction of TGF-b RI mRNA was not
found in the intact tissue outside of the lesion including ipsilateral
and contralateral hemispheres.
TGF-b RII mRNA was also induced at 72 h following MCAO
(Fig. 3B). In fact, the distribution of TGF-b RII expression was
similar to that of TGF-b RI except in the intact cerebral cortex,
where TGF-b RII showed the same, very low level of expression as
in the intact brain (Fig. 4B). High magnification bright-field
images demonstrated that the in situ hybridization signal, the
autoradiography grains were distributed above cell bodies

histochemistry (Fig. 2). The expression did not change outside of
the lesion. Thus, it was similar to their expression in the
contralateral side and in the sham operated controls. A low level
of TGF-b RI expression was observed in the intact caudate
putamen and a higher level in the cortex while the basal
expression level of TGF-b RII, RIII, and ALK1 mRNA was very
low. The peri-infarct area represented a transition between the
lesion and the intact tissue without specific induction in the mRNA
level of any TGF-b receptor (Fig. 2). Even though permanent
MCAO led to larger lesion, the expression patters of TGF-b
receptors was similar to transient lesions: there were no visible
inductions in the mRNA levels of TGF-b receptors in any brain
region.

this time point was that TGF-b RI mRNA appeared within the
lesion. Some cells were strongly labeled with TGF-b RI mRNA.
Their distribution was uneven. However, they were present

that at 72 h (Fig. 5D). A penumbra was not identifiable at this
time point. Outside of the lesion, only TGF-b RI showed
abundant labeling with a distribution similar to the intact brain
in the cerebral cortex but was not induced above normal levels
(Fig. 5A).

(Fig. 3E, F). In bright-field, it was also apparent that the signal has
lower intensity for TGF-b RII than for TGF-b RI (Fig. 3E, F).
TGF-b RIII mRNA showed an elevated level within the lesion
and in the penumbra (1-way ANOVA for cortex and Bonferroni
posttest: F = 19.29, t = 4.40; p,0.01; for striatum: F = 42.09,
t = 7.12; p,0.001; Fig. 3C, 4C). The increase was less pronounced
than for other TGF-b receptors but still clearly visible. The labeled
cells were distributed in large areas. It was also obvious using
bright-field analysis of Giemsa counterstained sections that TGF-b
RIII mRNA was associated with blood vessels (Fig. 3G) within the
infarct and the penumbra. In contrast, an induction of TGF-b
RIII mRNA was not observed in the intact tissue ((1-way ANOVA
for cortex: F = 2.70; for striatum: F = 1.20; Fig. 4C). It was also
demonstrated in bright field that TGF-b receptor signals represent
labeling of individual cells as autoradiography grains were
accumulated above cell bodies (Fig. 3E–H).
Alk1 mRNA was also apparent at 72 h after MCAO. The
distribution of induced Alk1 mRNA was similar to that of TGF-b
RIII (Fig. 3D). However, the intensity of labeling was more intense
for Alk1 (Fig. 3H). Also similar to TGF-b RIII, Alk1 mRNA was
not induced in the intact brain tissue (Fig. 4D).
1 month after transient MCAO. TGF-b RI and RII
expression remained very high within the infarct area (Fig. 5A,
B). In fact, the remaining, not shrunken tissue showed an even
higher expression level of TGF-b RI and RII mRNA at 1 mo than
at 72 h following MCAO (Fig. 4). Interestingly, TGF-b RIII
mRNA was further induced within the lesion and its distribution
became similar to that of TGF-b RI and RII (Fig. 5C). In contrast,
the distribution and labeling intensity of Alk1 remained similar to

The cell types expressing TGF-b receptors
As expected, all markers labeled a large number of cells in the
brain outside the lesion. The labeling patterns of the markers were
not changed noticeably away from the lesion when compared to
the corresponding brain regions in control, not operated animals.
The fairly large number of TGF-b RI-expressing cells in the
cerebral cortex away from the lesion was neurons and only a few
of them were glial cells. Thus, black in situ hybridization signal colocalized with brown NeuN immunoreactivity in a large number
of cells (Fig. 6). 51 out of 54 TGF-b RI-expressing cells in a 0.16
mm2 area were double labeled with NeuN in layer IV. of the
cortex and only few cells were labeled with glial markers (Table 1).
Other layers contained less TGF-b RI-expressing cells but the vast
majority was still neurons. The much lower number of cells
labeled for other TGF-b receptors in the intact brain tissue was
astrocytes (labeled with S100) and neurons (labeled with NeuN) for
TGF-b RII, and neurons and endothelial cells (labeled with von
Willebrand factor) for TGF-b RIII and Alk1.
In the brain sections of not operated and sham operated rats,
Iba1 immunohistochemistry labeled resting microglia with ramified thin processes. In the perimeter of the lesion, intensely Iba1-ir,
large, ameboid-shaped cells were present 24 h after MCAO
suggesting the appearance of activated microglia. At 72 h after

34 cells (Table 1). In contrast, only a low ratio of TGF-b RIexpressing cells was endothels: 2 out of 46 cells were double
labeled with vWF (Table 1).

MCAO, Iba1 immunoreactivity was further increased around the
lesion. In addition, Iba1-ir cells were visible within the infarct area
(Fig. 7). The distribution of Iba1-ir cells was similar to that of
TGF-b RI and RII-expressing cells. Furthermore, a combination
of Iba1 immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization for TGFb RI and RII indicated co-localization of Iba1 and these 2
receptor types within the ischemic core as well as around the lesion
(Fig. 7). Almost all TGF-b RI (41 out of 46 within a 0.16 mm2
area), and the majority of TGF-b RII-expressing cells 23 out of 34)
contained Iba1 while most Iba1-ir cells in and around the lesion
expressed TGF-b RI and RII (Table 1). In contrast, the
distribution of TGF-b RIII and Alk1-expressing cells had different
distributions and showed no co-localization with Iba1 (Fig. 8).
Both S100- and NeuN-ir cells were essentially absent in the
ischemic core. Thus, apart from the above described Iba1-positive
microglia, blood vessels were present within the infarct. In fact, the
labeling intensity of immunolabeling with vWF and alpha-SMA
was higher within the infarct than outside of it (Fig. 8A). Double
labeling with ALK1 mRNA and alpha-SMA immunoreactivity
demonstrated that the cells labeled with different signals are in
each other’s proximity but no double labeling was visible (Fig. 8B).
Analysis of double labeled sections at high magnification revealed
that both Alk1 (Fig. 8C) and TGF-b RIII (Fig. 8G) are expressed
in endothelial cells labeled with vWF but not in smooth muscle
cells and microglia (Fig. 8B, D, F, H). For TGF-b RIII, 8 out of 10
cells, while for Alk1, 21 out of 21 cells in a 0.16 mm2 area were
positive for vWF within the infarct. In addition, TGF-b RII was
also expressed in endothelial cells (Fig. 8E), in a ratio of 13 out of

Discussion
Our findings indicate that TGF-b receptors are induced in the
brain following focal ischemic attack and that the mRNAs of
different types of TGF-b receptors have individual topographical
distributions in distinct cell types. We compare these patterns to
the distributions of previously published expressional data of TGFb receptors following MCAO, and also provide some information
on the mechanisms involved in the inductions. Finally, our data
are discussed in terms of the potential functions of the TGF-b
system in brain ischemia.

Novel findings on the expression of TGF-b receptors in
the brain following focal ischemia and their comparisons
with previous results
This study was unique in that it examined the expression and
induction of all 4 types of TGF-b receptors. Even though a
considerable size of lesion was found 24 h after the MCAO, the
change in the level of TGF-b receptors was not significant at this
time point. The lack of labeling within the lesion suggests that the
degrading neurons do not express TGF-b receptors and TGF-b
signaling may not be changed in the penumbral tissue, either. In
the intact tissue, the level of TGF-b RI was the highest, and it was

b RII mRNA levels, identified by RT-PCR, are dramatically
elevated in the ischemic area 3 days following permanent MCAO
in mice [33]. However, our results contrast the same report as an
increase was not detected for TGF-b RI in that study [33] as we
described the induction of TGF-b RI following MCAO in the
penumbra. We believe that the high level of basal expression of
TGF-b RI we found in the intact tissue by in situ hybridization
histochemistry masked the RT-PCR data. The presented data also
contradict a previous immunohistochemical study, which reported
that TGF-b RI and RII are induced in neurons, glial cells, and
endothels both the ipsi- and contralateral hemisphere in response
to MCAO [32]. Although different patterns are conceivable for
mRNA and protein induction, we believe that the antibody
specificities caused the differences as immunohistochemistry with
single antibodies against each subtype tested without using knockout animals is less reliable than the results obtained by two nonoverlapping in situ hybridization probes. Therefore, our study,
which first explored the activation of TGF-b receptors following
MCAO by in situ hybridization, can contribute to the clarification
of contradictory findings.
The majority of the cells that we identified with elevated levels
of TGF-b RI and RII were microglia, which we first confirmed by
double labeling using Iba1, an established marker of both ramified
and activated microglia [43]. This finding is in accordance with a

the only one organized topographically with particularly abundant
expression in layer IV. of the cerebral cortex, which implies
neuronal localization. It was indeed confirmed by double labeling
with NeuN. Neither the pattern of expression of TGF-b RI nor its
expression in neurons of layer IV has been reported previously
[17]. Most of the other cells labeled with TGF-b RI were
astrocytes double labeled with S100. The presence of TGF-b RII
in astrocytes was first demonstrated by double labeling, however, it
is consistent with previous reports using cultured astrocytes [31].
In contrast, TGF-b RIII and Alk1 were both located in some
neurons and vWF-labeled endothels. As for TGF-b RIII, a
neuronal localization has been suggested before [35] while Alk1
has been described both in neurons and endothels [36,38,41] in
concentrations higher than in astrocytes [38].
At 72h and 1 month following MCAO, all types of TGF-b
receptors showed significant induction. The spatial and temporal
pattern of induction was very similar for TGF-b RI and RII
suggesting their co-expression, which is consistent with the
functional receptor being a heteromer [4]. Both receptors were
markedly induced around the infarct area and within the lesion
but not outside the lesion and contralateral to the lesion. The
region around the infarct area may correspond to the ischemic
penumbra, a major target of neuroprotective treatment [42].
These findings are in agreement with a previous report that TGFPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

TGF-Beta Receptor Expression following MCAO

previous report describing that global ischemia evoked by a single
hypoxic exposure led to a concomitant upregulation of TGF-b RI
and RII mRNA and protein measured by RT-PCR and Western
blot, respectively [34]. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry
showed that TGF-b RI and RII expression occurred in microglia
(identified by a lectin of Lycopersicon esculentum that label both
microglia and blood vessel endothelial cells) and microglial cell
cultures were also shown to elevate their expression of TGF-b RI
and RII [34]. The present study using in situ hybridization
histochemistry and a marker specific to microglia established that
focal ischemia also leads to the microglial induction of TGF-b RI
and RII. Utilizing the superior spatial resolution of in situ
hybridization over RT-PCR and Western blot techniques, we
established that the expression level of TGF-b RI and RII is even
higher in the penumbra than within the lesion at 72 h after
MCAO. It was also first demonstrated that the microglial
expression of TGF-b RI and RII is further increased within the
infarct by 1 month after MCAO.
TGF-b RIII mRNA level showed a much smaller increase in
the penumbra and within the lesion at 72 h after MCAO than
TGF-b RI and II. Furthermore, the cells that exhibited elevated
expression level of TGF-b RIII at this time point were
predominantly endothels, a result is first reported in the current
study. Since endothels were found to contain only minimal
amount of TGF-b RI, it is possible that TGF-b RIII may mediate
other ligands that TGF-bs including bone morphogenetic proteins
(BMPs) [14,44,45]. The lack of TGF-b RIII in microglia at 72 h
following MCAO, a finding that has not been previously reported,
suggests that TGF-b RI and RII transmit TGF-b action without
TGF-b RIII receptors at this time point. According to previous
data, TGF-b RI and RII can indeed function in the absence of
TGF-b RIII as TGF-b receptor [46] except that the recognition of
TGF-b2 is missing [9]. However, we also first established that
TGF-b RIII appears in non-endothel cells within the lesion at 1
month following MCAO suggesting that TGF-b RI and RII can
recognize all TGF-b subtypes at this time point.
Alk1 expression showed a significant increase at 72 h after
MCAO in the penumbra and lesion. However, unlike TGF-b
RIII, its level has not been further elevated by 1 month after
MCAO. These findings are entirely novel and consistent with
previous results showing that Alk1 is induced in preexisting feeding
arteries and newly forming vessels during wound healing [41] and
that it becomes strongly upregulated in endothelial cells of
following endothelial denudation in vitro and in vivo [37]. Our
results first demonstrated that the elevation of Alk1 expression
takes place in endothelial cells following MCAO and we also
showed that TGF-b RII is also induced in endothelial cells.
However, we did not observe elevated Alk1 mRNA levels in
neurons, which is different from previous immunohistochemical
results [38]; it possible that an elevation in protein levels is not
reflected at the mRNA level. As a type I receptor, Alk1 may
require a type II receptor for signal transduction. Indeed, an
elevated level of TGF-b RII is present in endothelial cells allowing
the recognition of TGF-b [4,14]. In addition, Alk1 may also bind
to other type II receptors to recognize ligands others than TGF-bs,
such as BMP-9 and -10 [47]. Another interesting and novel point
of our results is the similarity in distribution between mRNA of
Alk1 and TGF-b RIII allowing potential interactions between
these receptors. Thus, the present study largely expanded our
knowledge on the induction of TGF-ß receptors following MCAO
as it first described the expression of 4 types of TGF-b receptors
simultaneously at different time points following an ischemic
attack.

response to hypoxia [34,52], which has been shown to induce
TGF-b RI and RII [52,53]. Interestingly, TGF-b RIII expression
is negatively regulated by TGF-b1 at least in some cancer cells
[54] and testicular cells [55]. This represents a possible mechanism
why TGF-b RIII is not expressed at 72 h in microglial cells. In
contrast to TGF-b RI and RII, TGF-b treatment does not
increase Alk1 expression [38], which may in turn be upregulated
in endothelial cells by soluble cytokines, e.g. interleukin 6, released
by injury [37].

Possible mechanisms of induction of TGF-ßs
The spatial and temporal patterns of induction was the same in
the area of the cerebral cortex and the caudate putamen (striatum)
suggesting that the mechanisms of induction of TGF-ß receptors
does not depend on the structure of the surrounding brain tissue.
Since the expression level of TGF-ß receptors was not different
between permanent occlusion and 1 h occlusion followed by
reperfusion, it is likely that ischemic damage itself rather than
reperfusion evokes the induction of TGF-ßs. Focal ischemic
damage is known to activate microglia in the infarct area as well as
in the adjacent surviving area [48] Microglial activation predominates over macrophage infiltration following MCAO [49]. Since
the expression levels were significantly higher in the penumbra
than within the lesion at 72 h, we suggest that the elevated TGF-b
RI and RII are in activated microglia invading the infarct and that
the increased expression of TGF-b RI and RII is predominantly a
consequence of microglial activation. Inflammatory cytokines
released, e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha and IL-1 have been
shown to induce TGF-ß1 expression in microglia and astrocytes
[50,51]. Cytokines, including TGF-bs themselves contribute to the
induction of TGF-b receptor levels. TGF-bs are released in

The TGF-b system following MCAO and its potential
functions in focal ischemia
Following MCAO, le TGF-b1 is induced in periinfarct areas all
around the lesion, while TGF-b2 and -b3 are expressed in specific
cortical layers (layers II., IV., V.) not only in the penumbra but
also in remote regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere by 24 h
following MCAO [20]. Thus, the activation of TGF-bs precedes
that of TGF-b receptors. At 72 h and 1 month after MCAO, the
distribution of TGF-b1 is very similar to that of TGF-b receptors.
TGF-b1 is expressed in the penumbra as well as within the lesion
in microglial and to a lesser extent in astroglial cells [20]. At 1

Figure 9. Schematic figure on TGF-b signaling at 72 h after MCAO. In the infarct area, TGF-b1 released from microglial cells acts on microglial
and endothelial cells via TGF-b RI and Alk1, respectively. In the penumbra, TGF-b1 released from astrocytes and microglial cells act on these glial cells
through TGF-b RI. Meanwhile, in the intact tissue away from the lesion, TGF-b2 and -b3 are released from neurons act on neurons and astrocytes by
means of TGF-b RI.

month after MCAO, TGF-b2 also appears in the infarct area.
Thus, TGF-b1 released from glial cells is the ligand, which
activates TGF-b receptors within the infarct (Fig. 9). In turn, at 1
month after MCAO, TGF-b2 may also contribute to it. TGF-b1
may act on microglial cells containing only TGF-b RI and RII at
72 h following MCAO while at 1 month, TGF-b RIII may also be
involved. TGF-b RIII is required for the action of TGF-b2 [44]
but not that of TGF-b1 [1,46], which is consistent with the
concomitant appearance of TGF-b2 and TGF-b RIII. The
released TGF-bs can also directly influence endothel cells by
acting on Alk1 receptors (Fig. 9). Meanwhile, TGF-b2 and -b3,
induced in neurons away from the lesion in the ipsilateral cortex
[20], may act on TGF-b receptors we found there (Fig. 9).
TGF-bs have neuroprotective actions against hypoxic events at
least partially mediated by microglial cells [24,25,27,56]. TGF-b
strongly enhances IL4-induced alternative activation of microglia,
which is in turn impaired after blocking the TGF-b RI [57]. This
alternative activation promotes tissue repair and extracellular
matrix reconstruction [58]. At the same time, TGF-b blocks the
classical activation of microglia induced by Th1 cytokines [59,60],
which represents a negative auto-feedback inhibitory action on
microglial function required to remove debris but also contributing
to neuronal damage [61]. TGF-bs are not only capable of
deactivating microglia [59] but even promote its selective
apoptosis thereby reducing inflammation-mediated neurotoxicity
[62,63].
TGF-bs acting on endothelial cells may also participate in other
processes following ischemia including neoangiogenesis [64,65].
Alk1 receptor was shown to inhibit angiogenesis using neutralizing
antibodies against Alk1 [47], an effect independent of vascular
endothelial growth factor signaling [66]. Furthermore, increasing
the expression of Alk1 in cultured endothelial cells enhanced the
TGF-b/Alk1 signaling pathway and endothelial cell functions like
tubulogenesis and migration [67]. Based on these functions of the
Alk1 receptor, it may also mediate the angiogenesis-promoting
effect of TGF-bs following MCAO.
TGF-b receptors on glial cells may in turn be involved in the
regulation of glial scar formation [21]. Local injection of a TGF-b
antagonist into cerebral wounds reduced glial scarring [68] and
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

abolished the fibrinogen-induced effects on glial scar formation
[69] likely by affecting the proliferation, migration and activation
of astrocytes [17,70] and the extracellular matrix environment
[71].
Direct actions on neurons have also been implicated in the
neuroprotective functions of TGF-bs [56,72,73]. Cortical neurons
are known to exhibit programmed cell death following MCAO
[74–77]. Since TGF-b2 and -b3 inhibit hypoxia-induced neuronal
apoptosis [56,72], and TGF-b2 and -b3 are induced in the cortex
[20], theymay exert neuroprotective functions by inhibiting
apoptosis in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex. In addition to neuronal
survival, TGF-bs might also be involved in neuronal repair, a
process increasingly investigated for post-stroke intervention [78].
After ischemic lesions, the restoration of neural functions requires
novel neurite growth and synapse formation, processes that have
also been shown to be influenced by TGF-bs [79–81] while
ischemia-induced neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation
may also include TGF-b pathways [22,23].

Conclusions
The induction TGF-b receptors have distinct spatial and
temporal resolutions suggesting their involvement in different
functions. In the penumbra and within the infarct area, there is a
profound induction of TGF-b RI and RII in microglial cells
suggesting the effects of TGF-b1 and at later time points by TGFb2 in the regulation of microglial function. In turn, Alk1 is induced
in epithelial cells within the infarcts, which implies the role of this
receptor type in angiogenesis followed by MCAO. TGF-b RIII is
expressed mainly in endothel cells at early time points but also in
other cells within the infarct by 1 month after MCAO. TGF-b
receptors are also present in astrocytes and neurons in the
penumbra, and the intact cortex outside of the lesion where they
may be involved in the regulation of glial scar formation, and antiapoptotic/neuronal repair functions, respectively. The alterations
in TGF-b receptor expression following MCAO suggests that
similar changes take place in and around the lesions in stroke
patients, too.

MCAO (B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 and B6), at 72 hours after transient
MCAO (C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 and C6) and 1 month after transient

hybridization histochemistry sections are shown contralateral to
the lesion (a, left column, 24 h following MCAO), ipsilateral to the
sham operation (b, middle column, 24 h following sham
operation), and in control brains without surgery (c, right column).
There are no differences between the expression of TGF-b RI (A)
at the side contralateral of the lesion (Aa), ipsilateral to the sham
operation (Ab) and in control (Ac) brains. Likewise, the expression
of TGF-b RII (B), TGF-b RIII (C), and ALK1 (D) mRNA are the
same in these types of intact brain tissues, which means very low
level of expression in all these cases. Abbreviations: cx – cerebral
cortex, cp – caudate putamen. Scale bar = 1 mm.
