Introduction
As the molecular chaperone Hsp70 is well known for its cell protective functions against
stress, it could be a useful therapeutic agent in the management of patients with acute
ischemic stroke.1 To date, several in vitro studies have clearly demonstrated the feasibility
and efficacy of Hsp70 as a neuroprotector.2–4 Previously, our group showed the possibility
that glial cells could release into the extracellular milieu an inducible form of Hsp70 that
would subsequently be taken up by neurons.5 This treatment gave the neurons increased
resistance to heat shock stress (44°C) and to staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Hsp70
has been shown to have neuroprotective potency in various other brain pathologies: for
example, we demonstrated that Hsp70 possesses high protective activity in a model of
chemically induced seizures in rats.6 After intracerebroventricular injection, the chaperone
was found exerting its neuroprotective capacity in the neurons and terminals of the limbic
seizure complex of the brain. Moreover, Hsp70 protected cells by removing/sequestering
protein aggregates inside the cells in an in vitro model of Huntington’s disease.7
A large body of evidence indicates that Hsp70 contributes to the pathogenesis
of ischemia and to cytoprotection during periods of stress. Previously, Soriano et al

Abstract: Recombinant 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) is an antiapoptotic protein that
has a cell protective activity in stress stimuli and thus could be a useful therapeutic agent in the
management of patients with acute ischemic stroke. The neuroprotective and neurotherapeutic
activity of recombinant Hsp70 was explored in a model of experimental stroke in rats. Ischemia
was produced by the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 45 minutes. To assess its neuroprotective capacity, Hsp70, at various concentrations, was intravenously injected 20 minutes prior
to ischemia. Forty-eight hours after ischemia, rats were sacrificed and brain tissue sections were
stained with 2% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride. Preliminary treatment with Hsp70 significantly
reduced the ischemic zone (optimal response at 2.5 mg/kg). To assess Hsp70’s neurotherapeutic
activity, we intravenously administered Hsp70 via the tail vein 2 hours after reperfusion (2 hours
and 45 minutes after ischemia). Rats were then kept alive for 72 hours. The ischemic region
was analyzed using a high-field 11 T MRI scanner. Administration of the Hsp70 decreased the
infarction zone in a dose-dependent manner with an optimal (threefold) therapeutic response at
5 mg/kg. Long-term treatment of the ischemic rats with Hsp70 formulated in alginate granules
with retarded release of protein further reduced the infarct volume in the brain as well as apoptotic area (annexin V staining). Due to its high neurotherapeutic potential, prolonged delivery
of Hsp70 could be useful in the management of acute ischemic stroke.

demonstrated that 10 minutes of focal ischemia resulted in
increased Hsp70 mRNA expression throughout the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) region.8 Later, Zhan et al showed that,
following vessel occlusion in a model of transient ischemic
attacks in rats, Hsp70 was induced in neurons throughout
the entire MCA territory.9 Other authors have proposed that
the region of Hsp70 expression following focal ischemia
corresponds to the molecular zone of the penumbra, located
outside of the infarction.10 The possibility of a correlation between Hsp70 expression and increased tolerance to
ischemia has been reported in studies.11–14 Thus, increased
accumulation of Hsp70 in neurons protects the cells against
ischemia.10
A convincing body of published data indicates that Hsp70
exerts cerebroprotective activity, although high levels of
protein are required for this to occur. Previously, Sharp et al
demonstrated that, at 72 hours following reperfusion, neurons
in the zone of ischemia were positive for activated caspase-3,
suggesting that, at declining levels, the chaperone was not
able to exert its neuroprotective activity.10 The administration
of exogenous Hsp70 may provide neurons in the penumbra
with the required level of protein. In a subsequent study, it
was shown that intravenous (IV) administration of Fv-Hsp70
significantly decreased infarct volume by 68% and improved
sensorimotor function compared to that in the saline-treated
control group.15 Another therapeutic approach could involve
inductors of chaperone expression (eg, flavonoids). It was
demonstrated that the flavonoid baicalin, known to activate
the Hsp70 cascade in neurons following reperfusion, provides
effective neuroprotection in an experimental model of global
ischemia.16
In the work presented here, we explored the cerebroprotective and neurotherapeutic effects of Hsp70 intravenously
administered at various concentrations in a model of transient
focal ischemia in rats. We also propose that, to achieve
effective therapy for ischemic stroke, a high level of Hsp70
should be sustained for a long period. For this reason, Hsp70
was encapsulated into spherical alginate granules designed
to release the protein slowly.

Materials and methods
Study design
We aimed to explore the neuroprotective and neurotherapeutic activity of Hsp70 in an experimental ischemic
model. Three consecutive substudies were undertaken:
1) IV ­administration of Hsp70 prior to the onset of ischemia;
2) IV injection of Hsp70 following acute ischemia; and
3) subcutaneous implantation of alginate granules designed

for slow release of Hsp70 following the onset of ischemia. All
experiments were performed after the protocol of the study
was approved by the ethics committee of First St Petersburg
IP Pavlov State Medical University (St Petersburg, ­Russia)
in compliance with the US ­Department of Health and
Human Services Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (1996).

Substudy 1: evaluation of the neuroprotective
function of Hsp70
The first study assessed the cerebroprotective potency of
Hsp70 administered 20 minutes prior to the onset of ischemia
(Figure  1A). Following ischemia, rats were kept alive for
48 hours. The animals were then sacrificed, and their brains
were extracted, sectioned, and stained by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) for analysis of the infarct volume. The
fifteen rats were divided into five groups of three animals
each as follows: 1) control group treated with IV injection
of bovine serum albumin (BSA) (5.0 mg/kg) in saline solution (placebo); 2) experimental group treated with single
IV injection of Hsp70 at 0.5 mg/kg; 3) experimental group
treated with Hsp70 1.0 mg/kg; 4) experimental group treated
with Hsp70 2.5 mg/kg; and 5) experimental group treated with
Hsp70 5.0 mg/kg.

Substudy 2: assessment of the neurotherapeutic
activity of Hsp70
The second study assessed the therapeutic activity of Hsp70
administered 2 hours following reperfusion (2 hours and
45 minutes after onset of ischemia) (Figure 1B). Animals
were kept alive for 72 hours, then sacrificed and analyzed
with the aid of high-field magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). The volume of brain tissue infarct was calculated.
Fifteen rats were divided into five groups of three animals
each as follows: 1) ­control group treated with IV injection of BSA (5.0 mg/kg) in saline solution (placebo); 2)
experimental group treated with single IV injection of
Hsp70 at 0.5  mg/kg; 3) experimental group treated with
Hsp70 1.0 mg/kg; 4) experimental group treated with Hsp70
2.5 mg/kg; and 5) experimental group treated with Hsp70
5.0 mg/kg. After the MRI study, animals were sacrificed and
their tissues subjected to immunohistological staining for the
presence of annexin V, an early marker of apoptosis.

Substudy 3: long-term administration of Hsp70
The third study assessed the therapeutic potency of Hsp70
administered with prolonged delivery, which we achieved
with alginate granules that were designed for slow release

of the ­protein. Two hours after reperfusion (2 hours and
45 minutes after onset of ischemia), granules loaded with
Hsp70 (1.0  mg/kg) or BSA (1.0 mg/kg) were implanted
subcutaneously in the midscapular region. Rats were kept
alive for 72 hours, then sacrificed. Rat brains were visualized
on the MRI scanner to measure the ischemic zones. Animals
were randomly divided into two groups of six animals each
as follows: 1) control group treated with alginate granules
containing BSA; and 2) experimental group treated with
Hsp70-loaded granules.

Recombinant 70 kDa heat shock
protein (HSP) Hsp70
Hsp70 was purified from bacteria transformed with a
pMSHSP plasmid as described elsewhere.7 Briefly, Hsp70
was purified by means of anion exchange chromatography
using DEAE-Sepharose (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Little
Chalfont, UK) followed by ATP-affinity chromatography
on ATP-Agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).
Lipopolysaccharide was depleted with the help of Polymyxin
B-agarose endotoxin removing gel (Sigma-Aldrich). The
quantitation of endotoxin was performed using the Limulus
amebocyte lysate assay (E-Toxate™ kit; Sigma-Aldrich). The
resulting endotoxin content was below 0.1 EU/mg Hsp70.

Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2014:8

For the analysis of Hsp70 penetration through the blood–
brain barrier (BBB) in in vivo experiments, the chaperone
was conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 555 (Invitrogen™;
Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) was
employed as the control protein.
To achieve prolonged delivery of Hsp70, we encapsulated the chaperone into alginate granules. To produce the
granules, we dissolved alginate powder (Acros Chemicals,
Geel, ­Belgium) in phosphate-buffer solution to make a 1.2%
alginate solution as described previously.17 Additionally, we
added Hsp70 to the alginate solution at a concentration of
1.0 mg/mL. The alginate suspension was dropped through a
22-gauge needle into a 102 mM CaCl2 solution at a distance of
1.5 to 2 cm from the fluid surface. This caused the formation
of alginate microspheres, which were allowed to harden for
an additional 10 minutes. The granules were round or elliptical in appearance. To evaluate the kinetics of Hsp70 release
from the granules, we used the fluorochrome-labeled protein
Hsp70-Alexa Fluor® 555. The quantity of released Hsp70 was
assessed using a LaserStrobe™ spectrofluorometer (Photon
Technology International, Edison, NJ, USA). Nearly 80%
of the protein loaded into the granules was released over
72 hours in in vitro experiments.

Rat stroke model
Male Wistar rats weighing 200–250 g were purchased from
an animal nursery (Rappolovo, St Petersburg, Russia) and
housed in transparent plastic cages under pathogen-free conditions, controlled temperature and humidity, and a 12-hour
light–dark cycle with sterile food and water ad libitum. To
create the experimental model, we applied the method of
transient ligation of the right MCA as reported by Koizumi
et al18 with the modifications described by Longa et al19 and
Belayev et al.20 Briefly, the right common carotid artery and
the internal carotid artery were exposed via a midline incision in the neck. A nylon filament suture (4-00; Ethicon, Inc.,
Somerville, NJ, USA) was advanced from the right external
carotid artery, through the common carotid artery, and up to
the internal carotid artery to block the origin of the MCA,
until a mild resistance was felt. The left MCA was occluded
for 45 minutes. After that, cerebral blood flow was restored
by withdrawal of the nylon thread.
Additionally, we performed left craniotomy for arterial
blood flow assessment and monitoring of the efficacy of
the MCA occlusion/reperfusion. Arterial blood flow was
measured in the area of left MCA vascularization by means
of high-frequency ultrasound Doppler flowmetry ­(Minimax,
Ltd., St Petersburg, Russia).21 At the cerebral surface,
a standard 20 MHz probe was positioned against the wall of
the artery to ensure blood flow measurement. Systolic blood
flow velocity, an important parameter of cerebral perfusion, was expressed in cm/s to be measured throughout the
­experiments (Figure S1).

TTC staining
Brain sections 2 mm in thickness were stained with 2% TTC
to assess necrosis. The slices were immersed in a 2% TTC
solution for 15 minutes at 37°C (pH =7.4). Areas with no
TTC staining were considered to be zones of necrosis.

MRI of experimental animals
MRI measurements were taken with an 11 T high-resolution
scanner (Bruker-BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) using the
FLASH (fast low-angle shot), RARE-T1, TurboRARE-T2,
and SE diffusion-weighted imaging techniques. Pulse
sequences were obtained in the coronal plane and included
T2-weighted scans (TR/TE 4,200/36 ms; flip angle 180°;
slice thickness 1.0 mm, interslice distance 1.2 mm;
FoV 2.5×2.5 cm; matrix 256×256; in total, 20 slices),
T1-weighted scans (TR/TE 1,500/7.5 ms; flip angle 180°;
slice thickness 1.0 mm; FoV 2.5×2.5 cm; matrix 256×256),
and FLASH scans (TR/TE 350/5.4 ms; flip angle 40°; slice

thickness 1.0 mm; FoV 2.5×2.5 cm; matrix 256×256). Additionally, we obtained diffusion-weighted images (DWIs)
(TR/TE 10,000/34.0  ms, flip angle 90°, slice thickness
1.0 mm; FoV 2.5×2.5 cm; matrix 256×256) in the coronal
plane for analysis of the parenchymal cytotoxic edema. For
the quantitative measurement of water diffusion, we applied
apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The obtained
MRI scans were ­processed using MIPAV ([Medical Image
Processing, Analysis, and Visualization] v 7.0.1) software
for Microsoft Windows (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond,
WA, USA).

Confocal microscopy analysis
To assess the distribution of Hsp70 labeled with Alexa Fluor®
555 in the brain following IV injection, rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 10  mg Zoletil-100
(tiletamine hydrochloride and zolazepam; Virbac, Carros,
France) and 0.2 mL 2% Rometar (xylazine hydrochloride;
Bioveta, Ivanovice na Hané, Czech Republic). Following intracardial perfusion with 4%  paraformaldehyde in
0.01 M phosphate-buffer solution, the brain was extracted
to be examined for the presence of fluorochrome-labeled
Hsp70. Each brain was embedded in TissueTek® and stored
at −80°C. Serial cryosections were obtained in the coronal
plane with a slice thickness of 10 µm. Nuclei were stained
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Sections were
mounted with DAKO mounting media (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). For analysis of the presence
of annexin V in the brain tissues, we used a commercially
available annexin V–fluorescein isothiocyanate kit (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Brain cryosections were stained for the presence
of annexin V and nuclei were detected using DAPI. Images
were captured with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal system (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) at 488 or 543 nm or a Leica
DM IRBE microscope at 405 nm.

Statistics and analysis
The measured infarct volumes on TTC-stained brain sections
or MRI scans were compared among control (BSA-treated)
rats and the various groups of Hsp70-treated rats, which were
given 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 mg/kg of Hsp70, respectively. In
the substudy evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of Hsp70 with
prolonged delivery, two groups were compared: control and
Hsp70-treated. One-way analysis of variance tests were run
to detect treatment differences. When the null hypothesis that
no differences were associated with different treatment means
was rejected, the Mann–Whitney U test was run to determine

whether one treatment differed significantly from all others.
One-way alternatives were used, since there was 0 power for
a two-way test with three subjects per group. The open source
software package R (v 3.0.2 [http://www.r-project.org/]; The
R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)
was used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was
determined at the alpha =0.05 level. Observations are generally reported as mean ± standard deviation.

Results
Hsp70 penetrates through the BBB
and accumulates in the brain tissues
To determine whether intravenously infused Hsp70 could
pass through the BBB, we assigned three animals to receive
administration of the chaperone by this means. Following
occlusion of the MCA for 45 minutes, we injected Hsp70
labeled with Alexa Fluor® 555 fluorochrome (5.0  mg/kg)
intravenously via the tail vein. After 24 hours, we sacrificed
these rats and assessed the distribution of the Hsp70 in
their brain tissues (Figure 2). Immunofluorescence images
of the coronal brain sections revealed the incorporation of

Hsp70 inside cells throughout the brain. Inside the cells,
the chaperone appeared as red dots surrounding the nuclei.
We observed a massive accumulation of Hsp70 in the
ependymal cells and in the choroid plexus of the ventricles
(Figure 2B and C). Hsp70 accumulated not only in the brain
cortex (Figure 2A), but also in the deep brain structures
(ie, the caudate nucleus, the lateral and medial septal nuclei,
and the lateral preoptic area). Intriguingly, we did not observe
Hsp70 in the corpus callosum (Figure 2B). Hsp70 was also
dramatically accumulated in the blood vessels within the
brain. It was present in the cytoplasm of the cells in all vessel
layers (ie, the adventitia, media, and intima) and to a great
extent in the endothelium (Figure 2G).
We also analyzed the influence of transient ischemia on
the permeability of the BBB to Hsp70. To determine this,
we treated some rats with an IV injection of Hsp70 (5.0 mg/
kg) without first inducing brain ischemia (n=3). Following
24 hours of protein IV administration, animals were sacrificed
and the pattern of accumulation of Hsp70 in the ischemiaexposed brains was compared with that in the experimental
group. In this assessment, we detected no protein in the brain
tissues (data not shown). Additionally, we assessed the permeability of the BBB to Hsp70 administered subcutaneously in
the form of alginate granules. Fluorochrome-labeled Hsp70Alexa Fluor®  555 was loaded into alginate microspheres
(1.0 mg/kg). Thirty minutes after the onset of ischemia, we
located the granules subcutaneously in the midscapular area.
After 24 hours, the animals were sacrificed and their brains
were examined for the presence of Hsp70. The pattern of
chaperone distribution corresponded to that seen when Hsp70
was infused intravenously (data not shown).

Notes: Following transient occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery
(45 minutes), Hsp70 conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 555 (Invitrogen™; Thermo Fisher

After 24 hours, the animal was sacrificed and its brain was extracted and sectioned.

Shown here is a brain section obtained in the coronal plane 3 mm posterior to the

To evaluate the neuroprotective activity of Hsp70, we administered Hsp70 intravenously 20 minutes prior to occlusion
of the MCA. Following injection, animals were kept alive
for 48  hours. They were then sacrificed and the sizes of
their cerebral infarctions and penumbrae were measured in
TTC-stained brain sections (Figure 3A). In the control group,
when BSA (5.0 mg/kg) was administered, we observed a
large area devoid of TTC staining on the cerebral arteryoccluded side of the brain. The infarct zone appeared as a
white area in clear contrast to the surrounding red (viable)
brain tissues. In certain animals, the infarcted area was
observed in the contralateral hemisphere. The ischemic zone
constituted nearly 20% of the brain ­volume (Figure 3B).
When Hsp70 was administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, we

did not observe any change in the volume of the infarct, but a
dose of 1.0 mg/kg caused a statistically significant reduction
of the ischemic area (P,0.001). Further dosage increases up
to 2.5 mg/kg showed a considerable neuroprotective effect.
At 2.5 mg/kg, the damaged tissue volume was less than 5%
of the total brain volume. Intriguingly, a dose of 5.0 mg/kg
abrogated the protective activity of Hsp70. On TTC-labeled
sections, we observed a reliable delineation of ischemic
brain tissue from the nonischemic white and gray matter of
the brain (Figure 3A).

IV injection of Hsp70 mediates its
neurotherapeutic effect in a dosedependent manner
To explore the therapeutic potential of Hsp70, we administered it intravenously 2 hours and 45 minutes after the
onset of acute occlusion of MCA. After 72  hours, MRI
brain scans were recorded and analyzed to determine infarct
volume and to identify the penumbra. We applied several
regimens including RARE-T1, TurboRARE-T2, FLASH,
and diffusion-weighted imaging in a relatively high-strength
magnetic field (11 T). T1- and T2-weighted images of
animals from the control group revealed massive infarcted
regions representing hyperintensive zones in the right hemispheres corresponding to the animals’ occluded right MCAs
(­Figure 4A). Fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences clearly
revealed the areas of edema in the brain. Additionally, we
applied the gradient recalled echo sequence (FLASH) to
detect any blood products in the white and gray matter, but
did not detect any hemorrhage. To analyze ischemic change
or cytotoxic edema, we also performed DWIs. Damaged

ischemic areas appeared bright on MRI diffusion imaging,
clearly showing the edema in the contralateral hemisphere.
IV infusion of Hsp70 at 0.5 mg/kg did not affect the infarct
volume nor did it reduce the magnitude of edema on DWIs
(Figure 4A). Further increasing the Hsp70 concentration
to 1.0 mg/kg turned out to be beneficial for the reduction
of the infarct zone. Interestingly, while the ischemic areas
look like rather localized hyperintensive regions on T1- and
T2-weighted scans, on DWIs, the edema appears to be more
widespread and to involve more subcortical structures.
Administration of Hsp70 at 2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg significantly
reduced the infarcted area on T1- and T2-weighted scans.
Though we clearly detected a reduction of blood flow in the
right MCA using ultrasound dopplerography, we did not
observe any parenchymal cytotoxic edema on DWIs, suggesting the therapeutic potency of Hsp70 at concentrations
over 2.5 mg/kg (Figure 4B).

Long-term administration of Hsp70
using alginate granules enhances the
neurotherapeutic potency of the protein
To enhance the therapeutic effect of Hsp70, we encapsulated
the chaperone into alginate granules. Following the onset of
focal ischemia, granules were injected subcutaneously into
the midscapular region. The kinetics of sustained Hsp70
release corresponded to the observed outflow of 80% of the

T1- and T2-weighted images (Figure 5A). On DWIs, regions
of cytotoxic edema in the contralateral hemisphere could
also be detected.
We quantitatively measured water diffusion in the extracellular matrix using ADC maps. In animals treated with
Hsp70-loaded alginate granules, we observed a significant
reduction in the volume of the infarctions in comparison to
control animals. Indeed, we observed ADC normalization in
the damaged areas of the brains in the experimental group
(Figure 5A). This normalization was predominantly seen in
the basal ganglia and white matter.
Following the MRI study, the rats’ brains were analyzed
for apoptosis using an annexin V detection kit. A subsequent
histological study revealed a decrease in the number of apoptotic areas in the Hsp70-treated group, whereas the control
group had extensive annexin-positive zones located in the
cortex and in the deep brain structures (Figure 5B).

Discussion
Currently, the only approved pharmacological therapy for
ischemic stroke is the recanalization of the occluded artery
with intravenously injected thrombolytics (eg, recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator).22 The high risk of hemorrhage associated with this treatment emphasizes the need
for additional neurotherapeutic approaches. Hsp70, a protein
that is known to be upregulated in neurons following injury,
might be a plausible candidate for use in the management of
ischemic stroke patients.
According to our data, Hsp70 penetrates through the
BBB, accumulating intracellularly throughout the brain
­(Figure 2). This process was observed in the ischemic brain
but not in the intact brain, suggesting the influence of ischemia on the permeability of the BBB to Hsp70. Ischemic
stroke as well as subsequent reperfusion injury can disrupt the
BBB.23 Previously, Zhan et al reported that Hsp70 conjugated
with Fv antibody (monoclonal antibody 3E10), a compound
developed for the delivery of recombinant proteins to cells
via equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2), can accumulate in the ischemic brain.15 In our study, using confocal
microscopy, we found that fluorochrome-labeled Hsp70 can
also penetrate the ischemic brain without any modification
(Figure 2). ­Moreover, not only IV injection but also other
routes of Hsp70 administration can be employed. For example, the subcutaneous application of Hsp70-loaded alginate
granules also enabled Hsp70 to reach the brain. Intriguingly,
we observed a dose-dependent accumulation of Hsp70 in the
brain, as higher dosages were associated with larger quantities
being retained in the brain. In a previous study, we revealed

that hypoxia induces an elevated expression of CD40, a
receptor for Hsp70, in glioma cells, and that the concentration
of this receptor controls the preferential retention of intravenously injected Hsp70 in the tumor site.24 Presumably, the
same phenomenon might contribute to the uptake of Hsp70
by the cells in ischemic brain tissues.
Hsp70 exerts a dose-dependent neuroprotective activity
when administered intravenously prior to the onset of ­ischemia
(Figure 3). The optimal effective concentration of Hsp70 was
2.5  mg/kg. Interestingly, at dosages over 5.0  mg/kg, we
detected a reduction in the chaperone’s ­protective influence.
Most probably, high dosages of Hsp70 (ie, 5.0 mg/kg) may
enhance the production of proinflammatory cytokines, thus
increasing ischemic injury. Asea et  al demonstrated that
Hsp70 can induce production of such cytokines through a
CD14-dependent pathway.25 Recently, it was reported that
Hsp70 at high concentrations is associated with proinflammatory cytokines (ie, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-12) in the early-onset
stage of preeclampsia, subsiding to lower levels in later
stages.25 Intriguingly, when Hsp70 was administered as a
neurotherapeutic agent, 2 hours and 45 minutes after the
onset of ischemia, we did not observe any side effects, even
at a concentration of 5.0 mg/kg (Figure 4).
Hsp70 may be involved in increasing the production
of whichever cytokines the body is producing at the time
of administration; the types of cytokines it promotes, then,
would depend on the stage of stroke. For example, in the
early phase of stroke (within the first few hours), there is
a many-fold increase in TNFα, IL-1, and IL-6 levels.26
This pro-­inflammatory phase is followed by an increase in
anti-­inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-10 and IL-1 receptor
antagonist) that may reduce the intensity of the inflammatory
response.27 One might suggest that an infusion of Hsp70 in the
early stage further enhances the ongoing production of proinflammatory molecules, whereas the same injection in a later
stage amplifies the ongoing production of anti-inflammatory
cytokines. In favor of this hypothesis are the overwhelming
data supporting the anti-inflammatory activity of Hsp70.28
In our experiment, we observed a significant reduction
in edema in the ischemic zone on DWIs when Hsp70 was
administered intravenously at concentrations over 1.0 mg/kg
(Figure 4). This could be partly explained if Hsp70 suppresses
the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). As proinflammatory agents, MMPs (eg, MMP-2, MMP-9) contribute to the
disruption of the BBB and increase vascular permeability in
the ischemic lesions.29,30 Hsp70 inhibits ischemia-induced
MMP-2 and MMP-9, thus contributing to upregulation of
the MMPs.31

Interestingly, in our analysis of MRI scans of the ischemic brain, we observed a mismatch between the implications of our T1- and T2-weighted images and those of our
DWIs (Figure 4). It appears that, in certain animals, the
visible changes associated with ischemia can be detected
only in DWIs. Despite ambiguity in the literature concerning the interpretation of these diffusion-weighted changes,
they are currently supposed to correspond to regions of
permanent ischemic damage.32 Therefore, we assessed
responses to Hsp70 therapy predominantly using diffusionweighted imaging as the more sensitive detection regimen
for ischemia.33,34
Encapsulation of the recombinant Hsp70 into alginate
granules further increased the cerebroprotective activity of
the chaperone, as was shown using high-resolution MRI
(Figure 5). The therapeutic efficiency of 1.0 mg/kg Hsp70
administered with prolonged delivery was comparable to
that of a single IV administration of Hsp70 at 2.5 mg/kg.
The swelling of the alginate granules, enabling subsequent
protein release, yields significantly higher levels of Hsp70
in comparison to a single IV injection, thus enhancing the
biological influence of the chaperone. It has previously been
reported by Luginbuehl et  al that cellular response rates
for an encapsulated protein (insulin-like growth ­factor  I
[IGF-I]) were noticeably increased due to the constant
release of high concentrations of the protein from alginate
capsules into the extracellular milieu.35 The importance of
long-term delivery in regard to the therapeutic activity of
Hsp70 has been demonstrated previously by our group in
immunotherapy studies related to B16 mouse melanoma
and C6 glioblastoma.36,37 Presumably, maintaining a high
level of Hsp70 in the body provides a constant supply of
neuroprotectors to the intracellular chaperone machinery
as well as a continuous anti-inflammatory influence in the
microenvironment within the ischemic zone.
Several of the mechanisms involved in Hsp70’s activity
might be responsible for its neuroprotective and neurotherapeutic efficiency. It is well known that Hsp70 plays
an important role in protein homeostasis (proteostasis),
assisting in protein folding, protecting subunits of intracellular proteins from various stresses (eg, heat shock,
hypoxia), and preventing protein aggregation or mediating
disassembly.37–39 In response to stress, including ischemia,
a cell’s expression level of Hsp70 increases, enhancing the
cell’s stress tolerance.9,39 A recent study has suggested that
the neuroprotective activity of Hsp70 might be explained not
only by its role as a chaperone but also through its capability to antagonize apoptosis directly.40 Through inhibiting

Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2014:8

the translocation of Bax to mitochondria, Hsp70 prevents
cytochrome c release as a result of mitochondrial ­membrane
­p ermeabilization, thus inhibiting caspase-dependent
apoptosis.40 In another study, by Saleh et al, it was demonstrated that Hsp70 binds to apoptosis protease activating
factor-1 (Apaf-1), thereby preventing the formation of the
apoptosome.41 Furthermore, Hsp70 was also shown to be
able to inhibit caspase-independent apoptosis through neutralizing the mitochondrial effector AIF.42 In our study, we
observed a significant reduction in annexin V expression in
the brains of Hsp70-treated rats in comparison to control rats,
thus suggesting the antiapoptotic activity of Hsp70 as a plausible mechanism of its neurotherapeutic effect (Figure 5B).
Nevertheless, other reported mechanisms of Hsp70 ­activity,
including the possibility that it inhibits the JNK-related
necrotic pathway and/or anti-inflammatory activity, might
play a role in its neuroprotective capacity.43,44
Other members of the HSP family could also be applied in
the management of the cerebral ischemia. Thus, 27 kDa HSP,
Hsp27, is notable of its cellular protective functions.45–47 In
the recent study by Teramoto et al, the therapeutic potential
of Hsp27 was demonstrated in a mouse model of transient
MCA occlusion.48 Animals that received an IV injection
of Hsp27 following cerebral ischemia had a significantly
reduced infarct size and improved neurological deficits.
Other HSPs, including Hsp60 and Hsp90, have also shown
antiapoptotic activity in the experimental cerebral ischemia,
but are less studied.49 Promising results in brain focal ischemia were obtained with an Hsp90 antagonist, geldanamycin
(benzoquinone ansamycin), which causes the release of the
heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and induces HSPs.4 Presumably,
the combined application of the Hsp70 with other chaperones
or their inductors might be beneficial in treatment of acute
ischemia.
The therapeutic potency of Hsp70 can be further
increased by combination with other cytokines known to
have cerebroprotective activity (eg, IL-10 and IL-1Ra).
In this manner, it has been demonstrated that treatment
with the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) significantly
decreases infarct volume.50 Subsequent clinical trials have
proven the relevance of IL-1Ra to the clinical outcomes of
ischemic stroke patients.51,52 The combined application of
Hsp70 and IL-1Ra might be beneficial in the treatment
of ischemia.

Recombinant Hsp70 showed high neuroprotective and neurotherapeutic activity in this experimental model of stroke
