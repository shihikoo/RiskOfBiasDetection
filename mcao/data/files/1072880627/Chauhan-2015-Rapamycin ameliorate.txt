Rapamycin has been shown to protect against middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) induced ischemic
injury. In this study, the neuroprotective effect of rapamycin on the metabolic changes induced by MCAo
was evaluated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of brain tissues. MCAo in rats was
induced by insertion of nylon ﬁlament. One hour after ischemia, rapamycin (250 mg/kg, i.p.) in dimethyl
sulfoxide was administered. Reperfusion was done 2 h after ischemia. Twenty-four hours after ischemia
phospholipase A2 (PLA2) levels and metabolic changes were assessed. Perchloric acid extraction was
performed on the brain of all animals (n ¼ 7; sham, vehicle; DMSO and rapamycin 250 mg/kg) and the
various brain metabolites were assessed by NMR spectroscopy. In all 44 metabolites were assigned in the
proton NMR spectrum of rat brain tissues. In the vehicle group, we observed increased lactate levels and
decreased levels of glutamate/glutamine, choline containing compounds, creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr/PCr),
taurine, myo-inositol, γ-amino butryic acid (GABA), N-aspartyl aspartate (NAA), purine and pyrimidine
metabolites. In rapamycin treated rats, there was increase in the levels of choline containing compounds,
NAA, myo-inositol, glutamate/glutamine, GABA, Cr/PCr and taurine as compared to those of vehicle control
(Po0.05). Rapamycin treatment reduced PLA2 levels as compared to vehicle group (Po0.05). Our ﬁndings
indicated that rapamycin reduced the increased PLA2 levels and altered brain metabolites after MCAo. These
protective effects might be attributed to its effect on cell membrane metabolism; glutamate induced toxicity
and calcium homeostasis in stroke.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a serious cause of mortality and morbidity affecting
about 16 million people worldwide every year (Strong et al., 2007).
After the onset of ischemia, multiple mechanisms contribute to
brain injury including excitotoxicity, activation of phospholipases,
generation of free radicals and activation of inﬂammatory cascade
(Phillis and O’Regan, 2003; Mattson et al., 2000). The pathophysiology and biochemistry implicated in the stroke injury have not
been fully elucidated. To understand the biochemical basis in
stroke, metabolic analysis may serve as a useful proposition.
Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is the
only approved therapy for treatment of ischemic stroke (Adams

et al., 2005). However, patients who receive this drug within the
initial therapeutic window have a high risk of intracranial hemorrhage (Külkens and Hacke, 2007), disruption of blood brain barrier,
seizures and progression of neuronal damage (Tsirka et al., 1997;
Wang et al., 1998; Zhuo et al., 2000). Rapamycin is an immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative agent, shown to act through
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) receptors and inhibit cell
survival, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and autophagy
(Manning and Cantley, 2007). It has been shown to afford
improvement in behavioral and learning in the animal models of
traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer disease and stroke (Erlich et al.,
2007; Caccamo et al., 2010; Chauhan et al., 2011).
Proton (1H ) in-vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
has been used to study the in-vivo alterations in the brain
biochemistry in several neurological conditions including brain
tumors (Brandão and Castillo, 2013), multiple sclerosis (Arnold
et al.,1990) and stroke (Lin et al., 2014; Cvoro et al., 2010). By
employing MRS spectroscopy, cerebral ischemia induced changes
in levels of brain metabolites such as lactate, N-acetyl aspartate
(NAA), choline (Cho) and creatine (Cr) have been detected in

stroke patients (Lin et al., 2014; Cvoro et al., 2010) and also in the
experimental models of stroke (van der Toorn et al., 1996; Yang
et al., 2012).
One of the experimental models, which depicts transient stroke
similar to, that observed in humans is the middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo) model. This model is easy to perform in rodents and
is widely used to study the potential of drugs in the treatment of
stroke (Chauhan et al., 2011, 2012; Rogers et al., 1997). We have
previously demonstrated the protective effect of rapamycin in the
MCA occlusion induced focal ischemia in rats (Chauhan et al., 2011).
This neuroprotection by rapamycin was evident in the biochemical,
neuro-imaging and functional outcomes. In the present study, our
objective has been to explore the mechanism of neuroprotection by
rapamycin on the brain biochemistry in the focal cerebral ischemia by
estimating the concentration of various metabolites using in -vitro 1H
NMR spectroscopy of brain tissues.

placed in the center of the receiver coil and shimmed on the
deuterium lock signal. The one-dimensional spectra with water
suppression were acquired using a single 901 pulse over a spectral
width of 7716 Hz using 32K data points, 64 scans and a relaxation
delay of 14 s. Two-dimensional correlated spectroscopy (COSY)
and the total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) were also carried
out. The typical parameters used for TOCSY experiments were:
data points 2K in F2 dimension, spectral width 7716 Hz and a
relaxation delay of 2 s. The number of t1 increments was 256 and
64 free induction decays per increment were acquired. The
concentrations of the metabolites were determined by comparing
the integrated intensity of the isolated resonances of the compounds of interest with that of the TSP signal (Sharma et al., 2003).
2.5. Statistical analysis
Data are represented as mean 7S.D. Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis was used for comparing the parameters. Po 0.05 was taken as the level of signiﬁcance.

2.1. Experimental groups
Male Wistar rats weighing 230–250 g (n¼ 7) were obtained
from the Central Animal Facility of All India Institute of Medical
Sciences, New Delhi, India. The animals were maintained under
standard laboratory conditions with natural dark–light cycle and
were allowed free access to standard dry rat diet and tap water. All
experimental procedures performed in rats were reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee.
MCAo was performed according to the procedure described
previously (Chauhan et al., 2011; Koizumi et al., 1986). The rats
were randomly divided into 3 groups, the ﬁrst was sham group (no
MCA occlusion and no drug treatment, n ¼7); the second was MCA
occluded and vehicle treated group (dimethyl sulfoxide, i.p., n ¼7)
whereas the third group was treated with rapamycin with a dose
of 250 mg/kg, i.p. dissolved in DMSO (dosage was selected from our
previous study by Chauhan et al. (2011), one hour after occlusion.
The rats were euthanized after 24 h and their brains were then
removed for the estimation of phospholipase A2 levels and for invitro NMR spectroscopy.
2.2. Measurement of phospholipase A2 concentration
The quantitative measurement of PLA2 in the rat brain was
performed using the commercial rat PLA2 ELISA kits (Cayman
Chemicals, USA). All procedures were performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

3. Results
3.1. Effect of rapamycin on PLA2 levels
Two hours of ischemia demonstrated signiﬁcant increase in PLA2
levels in vehicle group as compared to sham (Fig. 1) (Po0.05) as
assessed after 24 h. Treatment with rapamycin reduced the PLA2 levels
in the rapamycin group as compared to the vehicle treated group
(Fig. 1).
3.2. Brain metabolites assignments and concentrations
Figs. 2 and 3 show the representative aliphatic and aromatic
regions of the one- dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the perchloric
acid extract of cortex tissue of control, ischemia and rapamycin
treated rats.
The resonance assignments were carried out using coupling
connectivities observed in two-dimensional TOCSY and compared
with the chemical shift values of metabolites of tissue extracts of
muscle, brain and plasma (Yang et al., 2012; Sharma et al., 2003;
Chen et al., 2012).
A total of 44 metabolites were unambiguously assigned from
the PCA extract of the brain tissue of the normal and ischemic rats.
The chemical shifts of the metabolites are presented in Table 1.

2.3. Perchloric acid extraction
For performing the in vitro NMR, the water-soluble metabolites
were extracted from the excised rat brain cortex tissues using
perchloric acid extraction (PCA) as previously described earlier
(Payen et al., 1996; Sharma et al., 2003). 3-Trimethyl silyl propionic
acid (TSP) (0.5 mM) was added to the sample that served both as a
chemical shift reference and concentration standard for the proton
NMR studies (Sharma et al., 2003).
2.4. In vitro NMR spectroscopy
Proton NMR of tissue specimens was carried out on a 700 MHz
NMR spectrometer (Agilent) Technologies, U.K. The data was
acquired using a standard 5 mm dedicated multinuclear broadband inverse probe at 25 1C. The residual water was suppressed
using a pre-saturation pulse. The chemical shifts of the resonances
were referenced to TSP at 0 ppm. The sample in the NMR tube was

of brain PLA2 were investigated 24 h after ischemia. There is an increase in the
brain PLA2 level in the vehicle as compared to sham group at 24 h. With the
rapamycin 250 mg/kg treatment, the PLA2 levels were signiﬁcantly reduced. A
mortality of 14.2% (1/7) was observed in the vehicle treated group and no mortality
was observed in the rapamycin group.

3.3. Metabolites concentrations in the sham and vehicle rat brains
Fig. 4 represents the concentration of the metabolites in the
brain cortical tissues of sham, vehicle group and rapamycin treated
group. In the vehicle group, the concentration of lactate (Lac) was
signiﬁcantly higher (P o0.05) as compared to that of the sham
group. Within the rapamycin treated group of rats, the Lac
concentration was signiﬁcantly lower as compared to that of the
vehicle treated group (P o0.05). The concentrations of glutamate/
glutamine (Glu/Gln), glycerophosphoryl choline/ Phosphorylcholine (GPC/PC), creatine/phosphocreatine (Cr/PCr), taurine (Tau),
myo-inositol (mI), γ-amino butryic acid (GABA) and N-aspartyl
aspartate (NAA) were signiﬁcantly lower in vehicle treated group
as compared to those of sham controls (P o0.05). Rapamycin
treatment signiﬁcantly increased the concentrations of Glu/Gln,

GPC/PC, Cr/PCr, Tau, mI, GABA and NAA as compared to those of
vehicle treated group (P o0.05).

4. Discussion
In our previous study we demonstrated that rapamycin protects
against ischemic injury in rats. The neuroprotective effects were
evident in diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI),
functional outcomes and also decrease in oxidative stress and
inﬂammation (Chauhan et al., 2011). Occlusion of MCA in rats
resulted in motor deﬁcits and increase in malondialdehyde, nitric
oxide and myeloperoxidase levels and decrease in glutathione levels.
Treatment with rapamycin ameliorated motor impairments related
with MCAo and also signiﬁcantly reversed the changes in levels of

malondialdehyde, glutathione, nitric oxide and myeloperoxidase,
reﬂecting to having antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory activity. We
also observed an increase in infarct area and the signal intensity and
a decrease in apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) in vehicle group
indicating to ischemia-induced injury (Chauhan et al., 2011). The
infarct volumes were signiﬁcantly lower in rapamycin treated group
than those seen in vehicle treated rats (Chauhan et al., 2011). In the
present study we investigated the alterations of brain metabolism
due to ischemia and the effect of rapamycin treatment using in-vitro
NMR spectroscopy.
During ischemia, oxygen and glucose depletion starts, leading to
anaerobic metabolism and concomitant energy failure resulting in
metabolic changes including lactic acidosis and alterations in the
levels of neurotransmitters (Siesjö, 1984). Our data indicated
increased concentration of Lac in the vehicle group as compared to
that of sham group reﬂecting to the injury. Moreover, increase in Lac
concentration in ischemia may reﬂect the initial loss of calcium
homeostasis or increase in calcium inﬂux into mitochondria due to
membrane depolarization, resulting in mitochondrial injury (Siesjö,
1984; Deshpande et al., 1987). In addition, we observed a decrease in
concentrations of CrþPCr in vehicle treated group as compared to
sham group. The CrþPCr is an important entity in the energy
metabolism involved in mitochondria (Klein and Ferrante, 2007)
that regulates the energy homeostasis in the brain during high and

irregular energy demands. The decrease in CrþPCr levels has been
shown to be present after ischemia and suggests to alterations in the
energy balance in the brain due to ischemia induced oxidative stress
(Gideon et al., 1992). In our previous study (Chauhan et al., 2011), we
had observed that ischemia induces oxidative stress by decreasing
the levels of reduced glutathione and increasing the brain levels of
malondialdehyde and nitric oxide in the MCAo induced rats. The
decrease in the CrþPCr levels in the vehicle treated group in the
present work might be attributed to oxidative stress induced energy
imbalance. However, treatment with rapamycin in the MCAo
induced rats showed increased levels of Crþ PCr, reﬂecting the role
of rapamycin on energy metabolisms. Also, this ﬁnding correlates
well with our previous observations in which we demonstrated
increase in glutathione and decrease in the brain levels of malondialdehyde and nitric oxide in the rapamycin treated group.
Decreased concentration of NAA and Tau in the vehicle treated
group as compared to sham group was observed in our data.
Apparently, NAA is speciﬁc to neurons; its decrease reﬂects neuronal
damage. A decrease in NAA has been reported in mitochondrial
myopathy (José da Rocha et al., 2008), aging (Lim and Spielman,
1997) and stroke (Chen et al., 2012). Bates et al. (1996) demonstrated
the role of reduced NAA levels in mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, in our previous study, we had observed a signiﬁcant decrease in
brain glutathione levels after stroke and brain glutathione levels have

been reported to be important for optimum mitochondrial function
(Heales et al., 1995) and also for maintaining oxidative and antioxidative balance (Chauhan et al., 2012). Reduced brain glutathione
levels affect neuronal integrity (Heales et al., 1995), thereby, affecting
mitochondrial function and causing oxidative imbalance. On the
other hand, Tau is known to afford neuroprotection in the epileptic
seizures (El Idrissi et al., 2003) and cerebral ischemia (Chen et al.,
2012; Stummer et al., 1995). Previous studies have shown the
protective effect of Tau in oxidative injury and inﬂammation (Sun
et al., 2012; Mahalakshmi et al., 2003). In a study, the researchers
demonstrated that Tau acts as a modulator of mitochondrial protein
synthesis and increases mitochondrial respiratory chain activity
thereby protecting against superoxide generation (Jong et al., 2012).
In rats treated with rapamycin a signiﬁcant increase in NAA and Tau
was observed; this change in NAA and Tau may be partially
attributed to the protective effect of rapamycin on mitochondrial
function and reduction in oxidative stress in this group. However,
more studies need to undertake to conclude its role on mitochondrial
dysfunction and neuronal damage.
We also observed a signiﬁcant decrease in the concentration of
choline related compounds in the vehicle treated group, which
might reﬂect to disruption of cell membrane metabolism. Such
changes in the levels of choline after 24 h of ischemia corroborates
well with the previous reports (van der Toorn et al., 1995, 1996).
Choline like compounds Cho, PC and GPC along with mI are
integral components of membrane phospholipids and are associated with membrane metabolisms. Ischemia induced release of
glutamate leads to activation of PLA2 (Adibhatla et al., 2006);
eventually, PLA2 activation leads to disruption of cell membranes
and release of choline like compounds. Furthermore, we observed
an increase in the brain PLA2 levels in the vehicle group and
treatment with rapamycin ameliorated the PLA2 levels. In addition,
we had also observed decrease in the concentration of mI in the
vehicle group; this decrease corroborated well with the previous
reports (Nonaka et al., 1998) in which the authors have suggested
role of brain osmolytes such as mI in the formation of edema
following ischemic injury. Moreover, increase in Cho, PC þ GPC and
mI in the rapamycin treated group was observed; this effect may
be partially due to the reduction of the brain PLA2 levels postischemia as observed in this study. Thus, neuroprotection by
rapamycin might be attributed to the inhibition in activation of
PLA2 and membrane metabolisms.
Moreover, a signiﬁcant decrease was observed in the concentration of Glu/Gln, and GABA in the vehicle group as compared with the

sham control in the present study. The decrease in Glu/Gln might be
attributed to the ﬁnding that ischemia induces a depression in the
tricarboxylic acid cycle subsequently leading to an increase in the
oxidation of these metabolites as fuel alternatives or substrates to
glucose in brain (Pascual et al., 1998). Hence decreased levels of Glu/Gln
and GABA after ischemic injury are in agreement with the previous
studies (Yang et al., 2012; Pascual et al., 1998). The glial and neuronal
cells play an important role in glutaminergic neurotransmission, as
these cells are responsible for maintaining glutamate–glutamine
cycle. The glial cells use glucose as substrate and release Gln. This
Gln is than taken up by neuronal cells and release of Glu and GABA
takes place (Erecinska and Silver, 1990). The metabolism taking place
in glial and neuronal cells interacts closely and both cells compete for
glucose as primary substrate and also use Glu, Gln and GABA as
alternative substrates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Rapamycin
treatment was able to afford protection in the MCAo induced rats
by increasing the Glu/Gln and GABA suggesting its role in neurotransmission. In a study done by Weston et al. (2012) on wild type
neurons, they showed reduced excitatory synaptic output but not
inhibitory output when treated with rapamycin demonstrating the
role of rapamycin in neurotransmission. Still, more studies need to be
undertaken to fully explore the role of rapamycin on neurotransmission. In contrast to our ﬁndings, others have reported that administration of rapamycin can increase brain infarct size and increase
neurological deﬁcits in the ischemia post-conditioning model of
stroke (Xie et al., 2014). Also, rapamycin treatment decreases cell
survival and increases apoptotic injury in in vitro model of ischemia
(Xie et al., 2014; Chong et al., 2007). This difference in rapamycin
response to injury might be due to different models of ischemia used
or dose selection. However, one cannot rule out that rapamycin
affected the brain metabolites after stroke demonstrating neuro
protection.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion our results demonstrated that protective effects
of rapamycin may be either by directly acting as anti-oxidant/antiinﬂammatory or indirectly by affecting the brain metabolites
levels after stroke.
