a b s t r a c t
Exercise may be one of the most effective and sound therapies for stroke; however, the mechanisms underlying
the curative effects remain unclear. In this study, the effects of forced treadmill exercise with electric shock on
ischemic brain edema were investigated. Wistar rats were subjected to transient (90 min) middle cerebral artery
occlusion (tMCAO). Eighty nine rats with substantially large ischemic lesions were evaluated using magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and were randomly assigned to exercise and non-exercise groups. The rats were forced
to run at 4–6 m/s for 10 min/day on days 2, 3 and 4. Brain edema was measured on day 5 by MRI, histochemical
staining of brain sections and tissue water content determination (n = 7, each experiment). Motor function in
some rats was examined on day 30 (n = 6). Exercise reduced brain edema (P b 0.05–0.001, varied by the
methods) and ameliorated motor function (P b 0.05). The anti-glucocorticoid mifepristone or the antimineralocorticoid spironolactone abolished these effects, but orally administered corticosterone mimicked the
ameliorating effects of exercise. Exercise prevented the ischemia-induced expression of mRNA encoding aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) (n = 5 or 7, P b 0.01). Microglia and NG2 glia expressed NHE1 in
the peri-ischemic region of rat brains and also in mixed glial cultures. Corticosterone at ~10 nM reduced NHE1
and AQP4 expression in mixed glial and pure microglial cultures. Dexamethasone and aldosterone at 10 nM
did not signiﬁcantly alter NHE1 and AQP4 expression. Exposure to a NHE inhibitor caused shrinkage of microglial
cells. These results suggest that the stressful short-period and slow-paced treadmill exercise suppressed NHE1
and AQP4 expression resulting in the amelioration of brain edema at least partly via the moderate increase in
plasma corticosterone levels.

1. Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of morbidity and disability in the
world. Treatment with tissue plasminogen activator has rescued many
stroke patients from death or severe disability; however, it is only applicable to a small percentage of patients due to the risk of cerebral hemorrhage after reperfusion (Donnan et al., 2008). In contrast, poststroke physical exercise or activity has been recognized as an efﬁcient
therapeutic approach for almost all patients with various severities of
stroke. Physical exercise may prevent the enlargement of ischemic lesions after stroke onset and may lessen the effect of neurological

outcomes (Duncan et al., 2003; Van Peppen et al., 2004). A previous
study has shown that when physical exercise commences at an early
time point after stroke onset, such as 24–72 h after, exercise may have
beneﬁcial effects (Matsui et al., 2010).
With the use of rat or mouse stroke models, the effects of physical
exercise have been intensively studied to demonstrate its marked favorable effects on stroke volume and neurological function (Hayes et al.,
2008; Wang et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2003). Physical exercise during
the early phase after onset of an ischemic event may suppress the
proinﬂammatory response (Ma et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2012) and
endothelial cell apoptosis (Tian et al., 2013), or accelerate angiogenesis
in ischemic lesions (Gao et al., 2014). In addition, treadmill exercise may
upregulate brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression
(Chang et al., 2009). Very early initiation of exercise suppresses
blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown by modulating the expression
of molecules that regulate BBB function (Zhang et al., 2013). Many
other mechanisms likely play roles in the ameliorative effects of early

phase exercise. However, the exercise-induced/suppressed molecules
in the peripheral organs or circulation involved in ameliorating the
damaging effects remain unknown. Moreover, it has been reported
that early initiation of physical exercise may possibly aggravate the outcome of the ischemic brain insults (Humm et al., 1998; Risedal et al.,
1999). Therefore, identifying the molecules involved may lead to the development of alternative therapeutic modalities for severe stroke cases
that are difﬁcult to modulate with exercise therapies.
In this study, brain ischemia was induced by 90-min transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), which produces large stroke lesions in the cortex and striatum (Matsumoto et al., 2008). It has long
been said that brain edema peaks 2 to 5 days after the onset of infarction
(Shaw et al., 1959). Therefore, we investigated the severity of brain
edema and the effects of treadmill exercise on the edema on day 5 (or
4 days) after tMCAO. It was revealed that ischemic rats subjected to
10-min slow-paced exercise at the early phase of stroke onset could
ameliorate ischemia-induced brain edema volume. We investigated
the effects of treadmill exercise on the mRNA expression of various proteins in the ischemic rat brain. It was found that treadmill exercise
markedly suppressed the mRNA expression of Na+/H+ exchangers
(NHEs), as well as aquaporin 4 (AQP4). The suppression of these two
proteins may be critical for the inhibition of brain edema.

2.5. Treadmill exercise
After the stroke volume was evaluated with MRI on day 2, the selected ischemic rats were assigned to exercise and non-exercise groups. Although the assignment was basically random, the mean stroke volumes
measured with MRI of each group were adjusted so that they were not
signiﬁcantly different based on statistical analyses using unpaired t-test.
Exercise commenced at a speed of 4–6 m/min for 10 min at 7:30 pm
(dark time) for 3 days on a treadmill (Animal treadmill Exer 3/6, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA). The treadmill platform was kept
level. When rats stopped exercising, they were shocked electrically
(75 V alternating current) with a shock grid equipped at the end of
the belt.
2.6. Administration of corticosterone and related agents
Corticosterone (25 mg) was dissolved in 1 L of 0.2% (v/v) ethanol.
The corticosterone solution was orally administered to ischemic rats.
Control rats drank water containing only 0.2% (v/v) ethanol. Normally,
rats consumed 42.8 ± 3.8 mL of water/day. Therefore, the dose of corticosterone was approximately 3.8 mg/kg body weight/day. The mineralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone and the glucocorticoid antagonist
mifepristone were dissolved in propylene glycol (Wako, Osaka, Japan)
at a concentration of 37.5 mg/mL. The solution was administered to
rats by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 30 mg/kg shortly after treadmill exercise.

2.1. Agents
2.7. Evaluation of brain edema
Corticosterone, mifepristone, spironolactone, dexamethasone, aldosterone, and ethyl-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

2.2. Animals and MCAO procedure
The experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines
for Animal Experimentation of Ehime University Graduate School of
Medicine. Adult male Wistar rats (8 weeks old; body weight, 270 to
310 g) were used for all experiments. Transient (90 min) right MCAO
(tMCAO) was performed as described previously (Matsumoto et al.,
2007).

Ischemia-induced brain edema was evaluated by the following three
methods on day 5.
2.7.1. Histochemical staining with Hoechst 33342
Ischemic rats were transcardially perfused with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mM
MgCl 2. The ﬁxed brains were cryosectioned into 10-μm-thick sections. Sections at 1.2 mm posterior to bregma were stained with
Hoechst 33342 and the micrographs were obtained with a scanning
ﬂuorescence microscope (BZ-9000; Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Areas
of the right (or ischemic) and left hemispheres were measured
using ImageJ 1.43u software, and the extent of brain edema was calculated using the following equation: (right hemisphere area − left
hemisphere area) / left area.

2.3. Experimental design
The experimental design is shown in Fig. 1A. All rats subjected to
tMCAO underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis on day
2 to measure stroke volume. Ischemic rats bearing stroke lesions,
whose volumes were larger than 320 mm3 and smaller than 410 mm3
(mean volume 363.4; n = 89), were subjected to the following experiments; treadmill exercise, determination of the area or volume of ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres, RT-PCR experiments, and Rota-rod
testing.

2.4. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
MR images of ischemic rat heads were acquired with a 1.5 T MR mini
SA (DS Pharma Biomedical, Osaka, Japan). A T2-weighted MR sequence
was used with 1-mm slice thickness (total 13 slices). During acquisition
of MR images, animals were anesthetized with 1.5% (v/v) isoﬂurane in
50% (v/v) O2 and 50% (v/v) air. The infarct area was calculated from
T2-weighted MR images using marking areas of the high intensity
areas in T2-weighted MR images as ischemic lesion areas, and the infarct volume was calculated by taking into account the slice thickness
(1 mm/slice).

2.7.2. Volume measurements of both hemispheres by MRI
Ischemic rats were subjected to imaging by MRI. T2-weighted MR
images of ischemic rat brains were obtained and the volumes of both
hemispheres were calculated using software equipped with the MRI
apparatus.
2.7.3. Brain water content determination
The ratio of wet weight (WW) and dry weight (DW) (wet/dry ratio)
was obtained to evaluate brain water content on 4 dpr. The DW was
measured after drying the brain tissue at 100 °C for 48 h. The WW and
DW of the ischemic and contralateral hemispheres were separately recorded. Brain edema was evaluated by determining the wet/dry ratio,
which was calculated with the formula WW/DW.
2.8. RNA isolation from the ischemic rat brain and quantitative real-time
RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis
Ischemic rats were deeply anesthetized with ethyl ether on day 5.
The brains were dissected, and 2-mm-thick coronal sections through
the caudoputamen were prepared. Total RNA extracted from tissue homogenates of cerebral cortices in the ischemic core, peri-ischemic region, and contralateral cortex were distinguished based on staining

with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium hydrochloride (TTC; Wako, Osaka,
Japan) (Fig. 2) as described elsewhere (Matsumoto et al., 2008). Total
RNA was also prepared from mixed glial cultures. qPCR was performed
as described elsewhere (Sugimoto et al., 2014). In brief, total RNA was
isolated using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from DNase Itreated RNA (1.5 μg) using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Tokyo, Japan) and oligo (dT)15 primers. cDNA was diluted at 1:3, and
triplicate volumes of 1 μL were used for quantitative PCR on a MJ mini
instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using Fast Start Universal SYBR
Green (Roche Diagnostic Japan, Tokyo, Japan). All gene-speciﬁc mRNA
expression measurements were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression levels. The primer sequences are listed in Table 1.

mixed glial cell cultures containing microglial cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte progenitors in poly-L-lysine (PLL)-coated 4-well culture
plates (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Yokohama, Japan) or in PLL-coated
75-cm2 ﬂasks with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum-supplemented Dulbecco's
modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM; Wako). Mixed glial cultures were
used on days 7–10. Based on immunocytochemical staining on mixed
glial cell culture, microglial cells were found to expressing HHE1 the
most markedly. Therefore, we puriﬁed microglial cells from the mixed
glial cultures grown in the ﬂasks as described elsewhere (Tanaka
et al., 1998) and the cells were served for further experiment using a
NHE1 inhibitor.
2.12. Immunohistochemistry

Ischemic rats were subjected to Rota-rod testing (Ugo Basile, Rotarod 7750, Italy) on day 29 for training, and day 30 for evaluation of
motor coordination and balance. The rats were placed on a rotating
drum and the total number of rotations made before rats fell down
was measured as described elsewhere (Choudhury et al., 2011).

The indirect immunoﬂuorescence method was employed as described elsewhere (Sugimoto et al., 2014) using the primary antibodies
listed in Table 2. Ten-micrometer-thick coronal cryosections at the
caudoputamen level or ﬁxed cultured cells on PLL-coated glass coverslips were incubated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% (w/
v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, incubated
with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with DyLight 488,
DyLight 549, and/or DyLight 649-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson
Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Hoechst 33342 was used for nuclear
staining. Rhodamine-labeled tomato lectin (TL; Sigma-Aldrich) was
used as a marker for macrophages and microglia. The immunostained
specimens were observed with a Nikon A1 confocal laser scan microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Fixed mixed glial cultures were subjected
to immunocytochemical staining in a similar manner.

2.11. Primary rat glial cell cultures

2.13. Low osmotic pressure loading and lactate dehydrogenase assay

Rat primary mixed glial cultures were prepared as described elsewhere (Tanaka et al., 1998). Brieﬂy, whole forebrains from neonatal
rats were dissected out and dissociated into individual cells with a
nylon bag with 160-μm pores. The dissociated cells were cultured as

Mixed glial cultures on PLL-coated 4-well plates were maintained for
48 h in serum-free DMEM (E2) containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3; Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), 4.5 mg/mL glucose, 5 μg/mL insulin,
5 nM sodium selenite, 5 μg/mL transferrin (Roche), and 0.2 mg/mL BSA
(Sigma-Aldrich). For some experiments, E2 was supplemented with either corticosterone (1–100 nM), dexamethasone (10 nM), or aldosterone (10 nM). To induce hypoosmotic damage, the cultures were
incubated for 1 h with twice-diluted protein-free DMEM that did not
contain phenol red. When evaluating the involvement of NHEs, the
cultures were incubated with EIPA (0–10 μM) for 30 min and then the
culture medium was replaced with diluted media containing the same
concentration of EIPA. Hypoosmotic damage was assessed using the
Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostic Japan) according to the
manufacturer's instructions by analyzing the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released from damaged cells into the culture medium
(Hosokawa et al., 2015). Data were expressed as the percentage of
released LDH activity to the total LDH activity.

2.9. Determination of plasma corticosterone levels
Shortly after treadmill exercise, blood samples were obtained by
cardiac puncture. The sera were prepared to determine plasma corticosterone levels using an ELISA kit (Arbor Assays, Ann Arbor, MI, USA).

Madison, WI) using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (SigmaAldrich) and nitroblue tetrazolium (Sigma-Aldrich) as a substrate.
2.15. Cell size determination
To determine the effects of NHEs on microglial cell size, microglial
cultures in 4-well plates were incubated with EIPA (0–10 μM) for 1 h.
Cells were ﬁxed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS containing
2 mM MgCl2 and stained with FITC-labeled phalloidin. Micrographs
were taken with a microscope (BX-52) using a 20 × lens, and images
were processed, binarized and measured using Adobe Photoshop

(Choudhury et al., 2011).

Student's t-tests (unpaired) or analysis of variance with Tukey's posthoc test. Signiﬁcance was set at P b 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Ameliorative effects of early, light and short-period treadmill exercise
Rats subjected to tMCAO were examined for ischemic brain lesions
on day 2 by MR imaging (Fig. 1). Only rats, of which lesion volumes
were in the range of 320–410 mm3, were used for subsequent experimentation. Rats in the exercise group were forced to walk for 10 min
slowly (4–6 m/min) on the level treadmill from days 2 to 4. When
rats ceased exercising, they were subjected to an electric shock by a
shock grid at the end of the belt. The severity or the volumes of
ischemia-induced brain edema were evaluated by three methods; one
was area measurement by ﬂuorescence staining with Hoechst 33342
on ﬁxed brain sections (Fig. 1B and D), comparisons of wet/dry ratio
of the both hemispheres (Fig. 1E), and measurement of volumes of
both hemispheres by MRI (Fig. 1H). As shown in panels D, E, and H,
the 3-day slow 10-min treadmill exercise signiﬁcantly reduced brain
edema areas (P b 0.05), weights (P b 0.01), and volumes (P b 0.001)
by ~10%. To see whether slow treadmill exercise led to better neurological outcomes, Rota-rod testing was performed on day 30 after MCAO.
Although exercise and non-exercise group rats were bred under the
same conditions, the exercise group rats displayed better motor function (Fig. 1F).
3.2. Possible involvement of corticosterone in the ameliorative effects of
treadmill exercise
A previous report demonstrates that electric shock-forced treadmill
exercise after MCAO increased plasma corticosterone levels (Hayes
et al., 2008). To conﬁrm these results, the plasma was collected from
the exercise and the non-exercise rats shortly after treadmill exercise
at 7:30 pm. Although the difference was not marked, exercise signiﬁcantly increased corticosterone levels (Fig. 1G). To examine whether
the increased corticosterone levels affected brain edema, corticosterone was orally administered to non-exercise rats for 3 days at
a dose of approximately 3.8 mg/kg body weight/day. For rats in
the exercise group, the anti-glucocorticoid mifepristone or antimineralocorticoid spironolactone was subcutaneously administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Corticosterone administration ameliorated brain edema to a similar level to that of exercise
rats (Fig. 1H). The ameliorative effects of exercise were almost
completely abolished by subcutaneous injection of mifepristone or
spironolactone.

3.3. Changes in mRNA expression
To gain insights into the mechanisms underlying the amelioration of
brain edema by exercise, total RNA was prepared from three regions of
the ischemic brain from exercise and non-exercise rats; contralateral
(Contra), peri-infarct (Peri), and ischemic core (Core) regions
(Fig. 2A). qPCR experiments (Fig. 2B) showed that mRNA expression
for brain vasculature-related factors, endothelin, CD34, laminin
(LAMA1 and LAMB1), and occludin, which are components of blood
vessels in the brain, was elevated in the ischemic core. Among these,
only the mRNA expression of LAMA1 in the core was signiﬁcantly suppressed by exercise (P b 0.001). Connexins (Cx30 and Cx43) may be involved in the transport of energetic metabolites such as glucose from
blood vessels to neurons (Rouach et al., 2008). Connexins may also be
responsible for stabilization of intercellular junctions, thereby, the formation of blood–brain barrier (De Bock et al., 2013). However, neither
ischemia nor exercise affected the expression of mRNA encoding Cx30
and Cx43. There are some reports describing the involvement of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the pathogenesis of stroke (Liu et al.,
2012; Rosenberg et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2013). Expression of mRNA
encoding MMPs 2 and 9 did not show any signiﬁcant differences between ischemic regions (Core and Peri) and the Contra, whereas
MMP3-mRNA signiﬁcantly increased in the Core (P b 0.001; Fig. 2C).
However, treadmill exercise did not affect MMP3-mRNA expression.
mRNA encoding platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1
(PECAM), E- and L-selectins, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2
(CCL2), proteins associated with the recruitment of circulating white
blood cells, increased in the Core (P b 0.01–0.001; Fig. 2D). However, exercise suppressed only CCL2-mRNA levels (P b 0.01). Expression of
mRNA encoding interleukin-18 (IL-18) and transforming growth factor
β1 (TGFβ1) showed signiﬁcant elevation in the Core (P b 0.001), and exercise suppressed the expression of both cytokines (P b 0.05–0.01;
Fig. 2E). mRNA encoding hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a neuroprotective factor (Doeppner et al., 2011; Hayashi et al., 2001), increased
in the Core (P b 0.001) and treadmill exercise did not further alter expression. Exercise did not change the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) mRNA. GFAP-mRNA expression was increased in
the Peri, suggesting that astrogliosis was being progressed (Fig. 2F).
Increased nestin mRNA expression in the Core (P b 0.001) may likely
be expressed by macrophages (Yokoyama et al., 2006), was weakly suppressed by exercise. AQP4, composing a water-selective channel, has
been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain edema (Manley et al.,
2000; Papadopoulos and Verkman, 2007). AQP4 mRNA expression
was elevated in the Peri (P b 0.001) as described elsewhere (Taniguchi
et al., 2000), which was signiﬁcantly suppressed by exercise (P b
0.01). The mRNA expression for phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), a regulatory glycolytic enzyme, was increased in the ischemic brain, and exercise suppressed this increase. In summary, exercise suppressed mRNA
levels of LAMA1, CCL2, IL-18, TGFβ1 and PFK1 only in the Core, and
mRNA levels of GFAP and AQP4 in the Peri.
3.4. Changes in the mRNA expression of NHEs in the ischemic brain
NHEs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of edema or changes
in cell volume (Hoffmann et al., 2009). Fig. 3 shows the effects of brain
ischemia and the exercise. Ischemic injury signiﬁcantly upregulated
the expression of mRNA encoding for NHEs 1 (P b 0.05), 6 (P b 0.01),
and 8 (P b 0.01) in the Peri region, while NHE7 (P b 0.01) and 9
(P b 0.05) mRNA increased in the Core. Treadmill exercise abolished
the increase in mRNA expression of the proteins. Among the NHEs affected by treadmill exercise, only NHE1 is located on the plasma membrane and regulates cell size (Hoffmann et al., 2009). Furthermore,
exercise completely abolished the increase in NHE1 mRNA expression
in the Peri. The suppressed expression of AQP4 and NHE1 mRNA may
lead to a decrease in cell size in ischemic tissue, resulting in the amelioration of brain edema.

3.5. Cells expressing NHE1 in the peri-ischemic region and cell cultures
To determine cell types expressing NHE1 in the Peri and Core,
immunohistochemical staining on day 5-ischemic brain sections
with the anti-NHE1 antibody was performed. Although NHE1immunoreactivity was diffusely distributed over the brain tissue
(data not shown), strong signals were found in the demarcation
zone (Claus et al., 2013) between the Peri and Core (Fig. 4). In the
Core, minor populations of CD11b+ macrophages (Fig. 4A, yellow
arrowheads) appeared to express NHE1. CD11b+ cells with ramiﬁed processes, which were supposedly activated resident microglia
(Sugimoto et al., 2014), showed weak expression of NHE1 (Fig. 4A,
blue arrowheads).
Activated astrocytes in the Peri did not show signiﬁcant NHE1immunoreactivity. NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2) has
been recognized as a marker for oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or
NG2 glia, whereas recent literature has described that macrophages or
activated microglial cells in the pathological brain express NG2
(Matsumoto et al., 2008; Sugimoto et al., 2014). NG2+ cells in the core
with round or amoeboid morphology may be macrophages, some of
which appeared to be NHE1+ (Fig. 4C, pink arrowheads). NG2+ endothelial cells were also NHE1+ (Fig. 4C, yellow arrowheads). NG2 glia
(Fig. 4C, blue arrowheads) or NG2+ microglia (Fig. 4C, white arrows)
appeared to weakly express NHE1. Thus, a variety of cell types expressing NHE1 were present in the Peri and Core.

To determine cell types that express NHE1 in vitro, immunocytochemical staining was performed on mixed glial cultures, which included astrocytes, microglial cells and NG2 glial cells (Fig. 5). Both tomato
lectin (TL)-labeled microglial cells (Fig. 5A, yellow arrowheads) and
NG2+ oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) or NG2 glial cells
(Fig. 5A, blue arrowheads) appeared to express NHE1. However, based
on the immunoﬂuorescence strength, microglial cells appeared to express NHE1 at the highest level in mixed glial cell cultures. GFAPexpressing astrocytes were abundantly present in culture, which only
faintly expressed NHE1 in their thin processes (Fig. 5B, blue arrows).
3.6. Corticosterone suppressed NHE1 and AQP4 expression in cultures
Mineralocorticoids or glucocorticoids have been shown to affect
Na+/H+ exchanger activity (Fujisawa et al., 2003). As shown in this
study and elsewhere (Hayes et al., 2008), treadmill exercise increases
plasma corticosterone levels. Therefore, we investigated the effects of
corticosterone on the expression of NHE1 by mixed glial culture
(Fig. 6A–E). Corticosterone at 10 and 30 nM suppressed NHE1 protein
expression (Fig. 6A and B). The glucocorticoid dexamethasone and the
mineralocorticoid aldosterone at 10 nM did not show signiﬁcant effects
on NHE1 expression. NHE1 has been recognized as a determinant of cell
size by modulating intracellular osmolality (Hoffmann et al., 2009). By
incubating cells with hypoosmotic media, cells will become larger because of an inﬂux of water. If NHE1 activity is suppressed, the cell may

Fig. 4. Cell types expressing NHE1 in the Peri region of non-exercise rats were investigated with immunoﬂuorescence staining and observed with confocal laser scanning microscopy.
(A) Double-staining to detect CD11b and NHE1 immunoreactivity revealed that CD11b+ macrophages (yellow arrowheads) and microglia (blue arrowheads) express NHE1.
Compared with NHE1 immunoﬂuorescence in macrophages, staining in microglial cells appeared to be weaker. (B) Very weak NHE1 immunoﬂuorescence was observed on GFAP+
astrocytes (blue arrowheads). (C) Cells expressing NG2 that are NG2+ macrophages (BINCs, pink arrowheads), presumably activated NG2+ microglial cells (white arrows), NG2 glial
cells (blue arrowheads), and endothelial cells (yellow arrowheads) express NHE1.

have increased resistance to hypoosmotic pressure by suppressing the
inﬂux of Na+ into the cytoplasm. Based on this idea, mixed glial cell cultures that had been cultured with corticosterone for 48 h were incubated with twice-diluted medium with water for 1 h. Cell damage was
evaluated by determining LDH activity in the conditioned media. Low
concentrations of corticosterone (3–30 nM) prevented hypoosmosisinduced damage of mixed glial cultures (Fig. 6C). One or 100 nM corticosterone, dexamethasone (10 nM) or aldosterone (10 nM) did not suppress the cellular damage. Ethyl-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA), an inhibitor
of NHE, suppressed the hypoosmosis-induced cellular damage in a
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, 10 nM corticosterone decreased the expression levels of mRNA encoding for
NHE1 (Fig. 6E) as well as AQP4 (Fig. 6F), whereas dexamethasone and
aldosterone at 10 nM did not display any signiﬁcant effects. Corticosterone at 3–10 nM suppressed NHE1 protein expression in microglial cultures (Fig. 6G). Microglial cells incubated with 10 μM EIPA for 1h
displayed shrunken somata (Fig. 6H and I).
4. Discussion
Although more vigorous treadmill exercise has been employed in
many studies to ameliorate the outcome of rat stroke models (Chang
et al., 2009; Gao et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2001), this study showed

that brief and slow-paced walking exercise on a treadmill could reduce
brain edema and produce better outcomes in a stroke rat model. Similar
results have been reported; low-intensity treadmill exercise (belt
speed; 2–8 m/min, 30 min) brings about a better outcome than high intensity exercise (8–22 m/min, 30 min) in terms of memory function
(Shimada et al., 2013). In the present study, all ischemic rats subjected
to treadmill exercise were electrically shocked at the shock grid at the
end of the treadmill belt on the ﬁrst day of exercise, in spite of the
very low belt speed (4 m/min) and short exercise period (10 min).
Thus, even slow paced, brief exercise appeared to be stressful for ischemic rats.
With respect to the mechanisms underlying the ameliorative effects,
we ﬁrst speculated the involvement of angiogenesis-related, proinﬂammatory, neuroprotective and/or glial factors in the ameliorative effects
of treadmill exercise (Fig. 2). We also speculated that factors produced
by highly proliferative macrophages accumulating in the Core might
be increased in response to treadmill exercise because macrophages
have been shown to be ameliorative in the stroke brain (Smirkin et al.,
2010). We observed the elevated expression of mRNA encoding for
CD34, LAMA1, LAMB1, occludin, MMP3, PECAM, E-selectin, L-selectin,
CCL2, IL-18, TGFβ1, HGF, PCNA, Nestin, and PFK1 in the Core on day 5
(Fig. 2). Among these, CCL2 (Tei et al., 2013), IL-18, TGFβ1 (Sugimoto
et al., 2014), HGF (Smirkin et al., 2010), PCNA (Matsumoto et al.,

antibodies against NHE1 and GFAP and also with TL. GFAP+ processes appeared to bear much weaker NHE1 ﬂuorescence (arrows) than that of microglial cells (yellow arrowheads).

2008; Nakata et al., 2011) and nestin (Yokoyama et al., 2006) may likely
be expressed by blood-borne macrophages.
Interestingly, exercise suppressed the expression of TGFβ1. TGFβ1
has been considered a favorable factor ameliorating the outcome of
brain ischemia (Ma et al., 2008). Exercise also inhibited HGF mRNA expression in the Core in spite of the favorable effects of HGF on ischemic
brains (Doeppner et al., 2011; Hayashi et al., 2001). Therefore, suppression of TGFβ1 and HGF expression may be attributable to the reduced

severity of ischemic lesions where many macrophages are present. Suppressed expression of these factors may be a consequence, but not a
cause, for the better outcome; the exercise primarily suppressed the aggravation of stroke lesions that may lead to reduced macrophage
accumulation.
Brain edema leads to neurological deterioration and poor outcome (Battey et al., 2014). In this study, light and brief treadmill exercise ameliorated brain edema and deﬁcits on day 30. Neuronal

death progresses during the subacute phase in the Peri (Claus et al.,
2013). AQP4 has been implicated in the genesis of brain edema
(Papadopoulos and Verkman, 2007; Taniguchi et al., 2000). Maximal
AQP4 expression is observed in the Peri in the cortex on day 3 after
MCAO (Taniguchi et al., 2000). Treadmill pretraining for 2 weeks before MCAO has been reported to reduce AQP4 expression in the ischemic brain as well as the severity of brain edema (He et al.,
2014). This study showed that AQP4 mRNA was increased in the
Peri on day 5, and that treadmill exercise almost abolished this increase. Thus, physical exercise may ameliorate brain edema at least
by suppressing AQP4 expression. However, AQP4 alone does not
cause any movement of water, unless some solutes move from the
cytosol to the outside, or vice versa.
We next monitored the expression of NHE1, because NHE1 may be
the most abundant isoform in the brain (Ma and Haddad, 1997) and
has often been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic injury.
Under ischemic conditions, because of the increase of H+ concentration
in cytoplasm, NHE1 activity is enhanced to increase intracellular Na+
concentrations while excreting intracellular H+ (Kintner et al., 2004).
NHEs have been recognized as a critical determinant of cell size

(Hoffmann et al., 2009; Ritter et al., 2001). If AQP4 overexpression is accompanied by increased NHE1 expression, the cells may be enlarged
leading to cytotoxic edema because of increased water inﬂux. We
found a signiﬁcant increase in the mRNA expression levels of NHEs 1,
6, 7, 8, and 9 in the ischemic brain (Fig. 3). Treadmill exercise abolished
the increase in NHE mRNA expression. Among the NHEs, only NHE1 was
localized to the cell membrane, while the other NHEs were located on
organelle membranes such as the Golgi apparatus or endosome,
and their involvement in the regulation of cell volume is unclear
(Hoffmann et al., 2009; Orlowski and Grinstein, 2004). Therefore, we
centrally addressed NHE1 expression in subsequent experiments.
PFK1, a regulatory enzyme for glycolysis, was found to be upregulated
in the Core (Fig. 2). The upregulated expression may be due to hypoxia.
Exercise suppressed PFK1 expression. The suppressed NHE expression
may decrease Na+ inﬂux resulting in a reduced demand for ATP and
less active glycolysis.
As shown here (Fig. 1) and in previous studies (Hayes et al., 2008),
forced treadmill exercise by electric shock caused weak or moderate increases in plasma corticosterone levels. In this study, we collected blood
samples for corticosterone determination shortly after the treadmill

160

exercise that was started at 7:30 pm, when the corticosterone level stably reaches the maximum in the normal male rats (Atkinson and
Waddell, 1997). To see whether weakly increased corticosterone levels
lead to suppressed NHE1 expression, mixed glial and microglial cultures
were incubated with various concentrations of corticosterone and the
change in NHE1 expression was investigated by immunoblotting
(Fig. 6). It has been reported that the glucocorticoid dexamethasone
(Rotte et al., 2011) and the mineralocorticoid deoxycorticosterone
(Fujisawa et al., 2003) increase NHE1 expression, and that chronic administration of corticosterone suppresses NHE1 expression (Muto
et al., 2000). In this study, it was found that low or moderate concentrations of corticosterone decreased NHE1 protein expression. Dexamethasone and aldosterone did not show signiﬁcant effects on NHE1
expression in the present in vitro study. Administration of corticosterone mimicked the ameliorative effects of treadmill exercise. Subcutaneous injection of the anti-glucocorticoid mifepristone and the antimineralocorticoid spironolactone abolished the ameliorative effects of
treadmill exercise. Microglial cells express functional receptors for
both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids and high concentrations of corticosterone may exert almost only glucocorticoid effects
(Tanaka et al., 1997). Taken together, cooperative effects through
gluco- and mineralocorticoid receptors may be necessary for the
ameliorative effects of treadmill exercise.
When activated in ischemic conditions, microglial cells display
enlarged somata and partly retracted processes (Kettenmann et al.,
2011; Sugimoto et al., 2014). Although astrocytes are reportedly the
major cell type expressing AQP4 in the brain, AQP4 expression has
also been shown in activated microglia in the adult rat brain (TomasCamardiel et al., 2004). As NHE1 expression in microglial cells was conﬁrmed in this study, as well as by others (Liu et al., 2010), NHE1 with
AQP4 may cooperatively contribute to the pathogenesis of brain edema;
NHE1 increases the intracellular osmotic pressure by increasing the inﬂux
of Na+, causing water inﬂux through AQP4 in glial cells including microglia in the Peri. Consequently, cell sizes of glial cells should increase leading
to aggravation of the brain edema. Moderate concentrations of corticosterone attenuated the expression of both AQP4 and NHE1 by mixed glial
and pure microglial cultures. This corticosterone action may lead to decrease in cell size, resulting in the amelioration of brain edema. In fact, a
NHE inhibitor EIPA signiﬁcantly decreased the size of microglial cells
in vitro. Another NHE1 inhibitor HOE-642 has been reported to reduce
brain edema after permanent MCAO in rats (O'Donnell et al., 2013). As
has been described (Hoffmann et al., 2009; Ritter et al., 2001), NHE1
thus plays a role in increasing cell volume that should lead to the aggravation of brain edema when its expression is elevated.
Although treatment with corticosteroids has been expected to reduce ischemia-induced brain edema, meta-analysis on clinical studies has found no preferable effects of corticosteroid treatment
(Sandercock and Soane, 2011). In these clinical studies, pure glucocorticoids or high dose glucocorticoids have been given to stroke patients (Norris and Hachinski, 1986). The present data shows that
either pure glucocorticoids or high dose corticosteroids do not
exert favorable effects in terms of NHE1 and AQP4 expression in
glial cultures. Therefore, determining the effects of low dose corticosterone treatment for the amelioration of brain edema in stroke patients is warranted
In conclusion, the present study suggests that brief, slow-paced, but
forced treadmill exercise, suppressed NHE1 and AQP4 expression, most
likely through a moderate increase of corticosterone that can bind to
both gluco- and mineralocorticoid receptors. The suppressed NHE1
and AQP4 expression may lead to the amelioration of ischemic brain injury at least partly by ameliorating brain edema by decreasing glial cell
size in the Peri. Collectively, exercise during the acute-subacute phase of
stroke may be important to reduce brain edema. As alternatives to physical exercise, corticosterone at low doses or NHE1 inhibitors may be employable for treating severe stroke patients, for whom exercise cannot
be applied.
