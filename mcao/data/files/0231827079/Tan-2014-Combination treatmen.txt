Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) is the only FDA-approved drug treatment for ischemic
stroke and must be used within 4.5 h. Thrombolytic treatment with r-tPA has deleterious effects on the
neurovascular unit that substantially increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage if administered too
late. These therapeutic shortcomings necessitate additional investigation into agents that can extend the
therapeutic window for safe use of thrombolytics. In this study, combination of r-tPA and APT102, a
novel form of human apyrase/ADPase, was investigated in a clinically-relevant aged-female rat embolic
ischemic stroke model. We propose that successfully extending the therapeutic window of r-tPA
administration would represent a signiﬁcant advance in the treatment of ischemic stroke due to a
signiﬁcant increase in the number of patients eligible for treatment. Results of our study showed
signiﬁcantly reduced mortality from 47% with r-tPA alone to 16% with co-administration of APT102 and
r-tPA. Co-administration decreased cortical (47 7 5% vs. 29 75%), striatal (50 72%, vs. 407 3%) and total
(48 73%vs. 337 4%) hemispheric infarct volume compared to r-tPA alone. APT102 improved neurological outcome (8.97 0.6, vs. 6.87 0.8) and decreased hemoglobin extravasation in cortical tissue
(1.97 0.1 mg/dl vs. 1.47 0.1 mg/dl) striatal tissue (2.1 7 0.3 mg/dl vs. 1.4 70.1 mg/dl) and whole brain
tissue (2.0 70.2 mg/dl vs. 1.470.1 mg/dl). These data suggest that APT102 can safely extend the
therapeutic window for r-tPA mediated reperfusion to 6 h following experimental stroke without
increased hemorrhagic transformation. APT102 offers to be a viable adjunct therapeutic option to
increase the number of clinical patients eligible for thrombolytic treatment after ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) is the only
FDA approved drug for treatment of focal ischemic stroke. Unfortunately, less than 5% of people suffering an ischemic stroke
receive r-tPA due to increased risk of secondary cerebral hemorrhage and edema formation. Thus, an unmet clinical need exists to
develop novel therapeutics that work in combination with r-tPA to
improve stroke outcome, reduce secondary complications, and
extend the time window for administering tPA.

Reasons for the failed translation of therapeutics from benchto-bedside are unclear but notable contrasts exist between preclinical models of ischemic stroke and the clinical population
having ischemic strokes. Speciﬁcally, stroke is a disease of the
elderly with approximately 72% of stroke patients being over the
age of 65 (Goldstein et al., 2006). In 2009, the Stroke Therapy
Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) committee recommended
that following evaluation of proposed therapeutics in young,
healthy male animals, further studies should be performed in
aged female animals and animals with comorbid conditions
(Fisher et al., 2009; Sacco et al., 2006).
Apyrase is a calcium-activated enzyme that catalyzes the
hydrolysis of ATP and ADP to yield AMP and inorganic phosphate.
Apyrase has found clinical application as a novel pathway for

Z. Tan et al. / European Journal of Pharmacology 738 (2014) 368–373

inhibition of platelet aggregation through the increased hydrolysis
of extracellular ADP. ATP 102 is an experimental ayrase formulation that has shown both antithrombotic and anti-inﬂammatory
activities with minimal risk of increased bleeding. Previous studies
have demonstrated that APT102 alone or in combination with
r-tPA prevents ischemia-reperfusion injury following lung
infarction (Eckle et al., 2007; Sugimoto et al., 2009), myocardial
infarction (Kohler et al., 2007; Moeckel Douglas et al., 2011) and
acute ischemic stroke in young male rats (Belayev et al., 2003; Sun
et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2010). Thus, in this study, we used a
combination therapy of r-tPA and APT102 in a clinically relevant
embolic stroke model in aged female rats to evaluate whether the
combination could safely extend the therapeutic time window for
r-tPA out to 6 h following ischemic stroke. By using aged female
rodents, tissue plasminogen activator mediated reperfusion,
and functional/neurological assessment; we successfully address
numerous STAIR recommendations for improving translation of
therapeutics from bench-to-bedside. Furthermore, we attempt
to increase the number of patients potentially eligible for r-tPAmediated reperfusion by extending the therapeutic window to 6 h
post-ischemia, a signiﬁcant ﬁnding with regards to reducing
ischemic stroke morbidity and mortality.

Placement in the proximal MCA was veriﬁed by a sudden decrease
in cerebral blood ﬂow as measured by laser Doppler. The microcatheter was withdrawn  1 mm, allowing cerebral blood ﬂow to
return to baseline, and then a 25 mm ﬁbrin-enriched clot was
injected. Successful MCA occlusion was conﬁrmed by a drop in
perfusion greater than 80% of baseline ﬂow. Recanalization was
achieved when cerebral blood ﬂow increased to at least 75% of
initial baseline. Rats not achieving these standards were excluded
from the study.

2.4. Modiﬁed Neurological Severity Score (mNSS)
Neurological function was assessed at 24 h post-MCAO by an
investigator blinded to the treatment group using the modiﬁed
Neurological Severity Score (mNSS). The modiﬁed Neurological
Severity Score (mNSS) evaluated motor, sensory, balance and
reﬂex measures. Scores range from 0 to 17 with higher scores
indicating greater neurologic injury (Seyfried et al., 2004).

2.5. TTC staining for determination of infarction volume
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Seventy-two female Sprague-Dawley rats (18–20 months old)
were purchased from Hilltop Laboratories (Scottdale, PA) and
housed under 12-h:12-h light–dark conditions with food and
water ad libitum. All studies involving rats were approved by the
West Virginia University Animal Care and Use Committee.
2.2. Drug treatment
Rats were randomly divided into three treatment groups: r-tPA
group (N ¼30), saline group (N ¼23), and r-tPA þAPT102 group
(N ¼ 19). The r-tPA group received r-tPA (5 mg/kg, Genentech;
South San Francisco, CA, USA) as an intravenous infusion (30%
bolus and 70% infused over 30 min) at 6 h after MCAO. The saline
group received an intravenous infusion of saline at 6 h after MCAO.
The r-tPA þAPT102 group received r-tPA (5 mg/kg) plus APT102
(2.25 mg/kg, APT Therapeutics Inc, St Louis, Missouri, 63108, USA)
as an intravenous infusion (30% bolus and 70% infused over
30 min) at 6 h after MCAO. Standard physiologic parameters were
monitored before, during, and after MCAO in a subset of rats (n¼ 3
per group) to ensure uniformity and consistency with prior
studies. All parameters were consistent with the ranges we
have previously published (DiNapoli et al., 2006), indicating that
APT102 did not induce obvious physiologic changes in blood
pressure, blood pH, and blood gas composition. Rats from all three
groups were evaluated at 24 h following MCAO.
2.3. Surgical procedure for MCAO
Rats were given a reversible embolic MCAO as previously
described (Dinapoli et al., 2006; DiNapoli et al., 2008; Tan et al.,
2009). Brieﬂy, rats were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane in a
mixture of 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide. A servo-controlled
homeothermic heating blanket, equipped with a rectal thermometer, was used to maintain body temperature at 37 1C. Cerebral
blood ﬂow was monitored with a laser Doppler probe precisely
positioned over the area supplied by the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). A modiﬁed PE 50 microcatheter was inserted into the
external carotid artery stump and advanced into the MCA.

At 24 h following MCAO, rats were sacriﬁced and infarct size
and volume were measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC; 2%) staining. 2 mm coronal brain slices were stained for
15 min at 37 1C. Hemispheres were scanned on a ﬂatbed scanner
and analyzed using Image J software. On each slice, the nonstained area (ischemic brain) was outlined, and the infarct volume
was calculated. The corrected infarction volume (CIV) was calculated using the following equation: CIV ¼(CHV  [IHV IHI])  d,
where CHV was the area of the contralateral cortex or striatum in
mm2, IHV was the area of the ipsilateral cortex or striatum in mm2,
IHI was the infarct area (cortical or striatal) in mm2, and d was
slice thickness (2 mm). Edema index was calculated as follows:
Edema index ¼([volume of ipsilateral hemispherevolume of
contralateral hemisphere]/volume of contralateral hemisphere) 
100% (Yang et al., 1998).

2.6. Spectrophotometric assay of hemoglobin
Hemorrhagic transformation was quantiﬁed using a spectrophotometric assay of brain hemoglobin content (QuantiChrom™
Hemoglobin Assay Kit). At 24 h after MCAO, the rats were
anesthetized with ketamine (90 mg/kg; i.p.; Webster Veterinary;
Sterling, MA) and xylazine (5 mg/kg; Webster Veterinary), and
then transcardially perfused with 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffered
saline until the outﬂow ﬂuid from the right atrium was clear. MCA
areas in left and right hemisphere were dissected out, homogenized, and centrifuged at 13,000g for 30 min. Supernatant (50 ml)
from each sample was aliquoted into a 96 well plate and 200 ml of
assay reagent was added. After 15 min incubation, optical density
was measured at 400 nm with a spectrophotometer. Hemoglobin
content was expressed as mg/dl tissue (Christoforidis et al., 2007).

2.7. Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean 7S.E.M. Differences in infarct
volume, mNSS, edema index and hemoglobin content between
treatment groups were compared using Students t-test. Differences in mortality rate between treatment groups were compared
using Fisher's exact test. Level of signiﬁcance was set at P o0.05.

3. Results

No rats were excluded from the study for not meeting the
ischemic brain injury criteria and no differences in reperfusion
were seen amongst groups receiving r-tPA. Mortality rate
was evaluated at 24 h following MCAO. Combination therapy of
APT102 and r-tPA signiﬁcantly reduced the mortality rate from 47%
in the r-tPA group to 16% in the r-tPA þ APT102 group (P ¼0.027).
No signiﬁcant difference (P ¼0.163) in mortality rate was found
between saline and r-tPA þ APT102 group rats. There was no
signiﬁcant difference (P ¼0.384) in mortality rate between saline
and r-tPA rats (Fig. 1). Some rats dying prior to 24 h were
autopsied with typical ﬁndings including larger hemispheric
infarctions, extensive brain edema, and macroscopic hemorrhage.
Rats dying prior to 24 h were not included in the histological,
hemoglobin assay, and performance studies. Many of the rats that
died prior to 24 h, particularly within the r-tPA group, exhibited
extensive hemorrhagic transformation and enlarged infarcts.
The higher mortality rate in the r-tPA group compared to the
r-tPA þAPT102 group, introduces a survival bias in that the most
severely infracted and impaired animals died and were excluded
from analysis. Therefore, the difference in parameters between
r-tPA and r-tPA þAPT102 is likely even larger than reported herein
due to this bias.
3.2. APT102 and r-tPA in combination reduced cortical, striatal, and
total hemispheric infarction size at 24 h following MCAO
Stroke volume of the cortex, striatum, and total cerebral
hemisphere was measured at 24 h following MCAO (Fig. 2).
Cortical (P¼ 0.011), striatal (P¼ 0.013), and total hemispheric
(P ¼0.004) infarction volume were signiﬁcantly reduced by
r-tPA þAPT102 combination treatment compared with r-tPA alone.
Cortical (P¼ 0.033), striatal (P ¼0.010), and total hemispheric
(P ¼0.011) infarction volume were signiﬁcantly reduced by
r-tPA þAPT102 combination treatment compared with saline
treated rats. No signiﬁcant difference in cortical (P ¼0.698), striatal

3.3. APT102 and r-tPA in combination improved neurological
function at 24 h post-MCAO
Before MCAO, neurological score was normal (score¼ 0) in all
animals. Neurological function using the modiﬁed Neurological
Severity Score (mNSS) was assessed at 24 h following MCAO.
Higher numbers indicate more severe deﬁcits. APT102 and r-tPA
in combination signiﬁcantly (P ¼0.045) improved the neurological
score compared with r-tPA alone. No signiﬁcant (P ¼0.331) difference in mNSS was noted between saline and r-tPA þ APT102
treated rats. No signiﬁcant (P ¼0.138) difference in neurological
scores was observed between saline and r-tPA treated rats (Fig. 3).

4. Discussion
This is the ﬁrst report of the evaluation of a soluble apyrase in a
reproducible and clinically relevant embolic stroke model of aged
female rats. The protective effect of r-tPA over placebo (saline) was
lost at 6 h following ischemic stroke. The main ﬁnding of
this study, taking into account prior ﬁndings demonstrating a
protective effect of r-tPA when administered at 2 h after ischemic
stroke (DiNapoli et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2009), was that r-tPA
in combination with the recombinant human apyrase (APT102)
safely extended the time window for r-tPA out to 6 h after

ischemic stroke in aged female rats. This study showed that
co-administration of APT102 with r-tPA signiﬁcantly reduced
mortality rate, decreased infarct volume and cerebral hemorrhage,
and improved neurological functional outcome at 24 h following
MCAO as compared to subjects treated with r-tPA alone. These
ﬁndings have signiﬁcant relevance in that this work can potentially translate to the clinical environment. The management of
ischemic stroke would thereby change radically. Speciﬁcally, r-tPA
could potentially be administered safely and efﬁcaciously until 6 h
post-ischemia, signiﬁcantly reducing morbidity and mortality.
Consistent with our previous studies, higher mortality and
larger infarct volumes were observed in aged female rats at 24 h
following MCAO and r-tPA reperfusion (Dinapoli et al., 2006;
DiNapoli et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2009). Prior studies in our
laboratory also show that experimental therapeutics (EEMMID
and apocynin) combined with r-tPA were neuroprotective follwing
ischemic stroke in young animals but not in aged animals (Tan et
al., 2009; Kelly et al., 2009). As a thrombolytic agent, r-tPA has
direct and deleterious effects on the neurovascular unit that
substantially increases death rate and infarct volume and causes
severe hemorrhage when administered intravenously following an
MCAO in a delayed fashion. Recent studies indicate that aged rats
were more severely impaired following ischemic stroke than
younger rats with diminished functional recovery (Popa-Wagner
et al., 2006a, 2006b, 2007). Clinically, increased age negatively
affects spontaneous recovery of stroke patients and is a primary
risk factor for fragility of the blood brain barrier and hemorrhagic
transformation following thrombolytic therapy (Fisher et al.,
2009). In the largest clinical trial of r-tPA use in stroke, the
International Stroke Trial 3 (IST-3), r-tPA treatment increased
symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 7 d from 1% to 7%.
This increase was then associated with a mortality of 11% in the
r-tPA group vs. 7% in the control group at 7 d following ischemic
stroke (Dávalos et al., 2012). Much of the mortality following
ischemic stroke is due to increased intracranial pressure produced
by edema formation.
Vascular endothelium and platelets maintain vascular integrity
and promote primary and secondary hemostasis following interruption of vessel continuity. Cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion is associated with endothelial damage and activation of
platelets (Marcus et al., 2001, 2005; Sugimoto et al., 2009). ATP
and ADP are released in high concentrations by activated endothelial cells and platelets following aggregation on endothelium. In
turn, ATP and ADP further increase additional platelet aggregation,
leading to microthrombus formation and the eventual worsening
of endothelial injury. Platelet and ﬁbrin deposition downstream of
an occlusive lesion contribute signiﬁcantly to the postischemic
hypoperfusion and tissue injury; thus, complicating stroke injury
(Belayev et al., 2003; Bours et al., 2006; Imai et al., 2000; Kohler et
al., 2007; Wang and Guidotti, 1996).
The beneﬁcial effects of co-administration of APT102 with r-tPA
at 6 h following MCAO may likely be explained by the effect of
apyrase. APT102, a novel form of the naturally occurring human
apyrase/ADPase (CD39, recombinant soluble human CD39), promotes the breakdown of extracellular ATP and ADP by catalyzing
the removal of the gamma phosphate from ATP and the beta
phosphate from ADP (Imai et al., 2000; Marcus et al., 1991; Pinsky
et al., 2002; Robson, 2006; Robson et al., 2005). APT102 does not
act on platelets per se but rather on prothrombolic mediators (ATP
and ADP). Increased MMP9 activity along the basement membrane
of the blood brain barrier is believed to cause hemorrhagic
transformation due to increased release and extravasation of
neutrophils. Moreover, APT102 most likely prevents hemorrhagic transformation by inhibiting ATP-induced endothelial cell
activation and neutrophil inﬁltration and re-sensitizing platelets
(Belayev et al., 2003; Guckelberger et al., 2004; Kohler et al., 2007;

Marcus et al., 2005; Moeckel Douglas et al., 2011; Robson, 2006).
As such, the protective effect of APT102 likely requires reperfusion
to be observed, a ﬁnding consistent with prior work in a thromboembolic model of ischemic stroke with r-tPA mediated reperfusion
(Sun et al., 2011). For this reason, APT102 was not studied in
isolation in this study and consequently, we cannot comment on
any protective effect of APT102 in isolation within our clinicallyrelevant model of ischemic stroke in aged female rats.
The effects of exogenously administered apyrase are consistent
with a prior study, in which CD39 knockout mice demonstrated
increased cerebral infarction volumes compared with control
CD39 wild type mice following experimental stroke. In addition,
the study showed that endogenous CD39 was protective after
stroke, and administration of pharmacological doses of soluble
CD39 was effective in inhibiting thrombosis and tissue injury
following ischemic stroke (Pinsky et al., 2002). Since soluble CD39
does not interfere with primary GPIb-mediated platelet adhesion
at the site of vessel damage, soluble CD39 administration should
not prevent a layer of platelets from forming at the site of injury or
interfere with hemostatic mechanisms that prevent intracerebral
hemorrhage (Belayev et al., 2003; Marcus et al., 2005). Compared
with aspirin, soluble CD39 may induce more potent inhibition of
platlet aggregation by blocking ADP-induced platelet recruitment.
Soluble CD39 was shown to be more efﬁcient in inhibiting platelet
recruitment than aspirin via blockade of the arachidonate/thromboxane pathway. Soluble CD39 disaggregates platelets under
recruitment, but it does not have a deleterious effect on primary
hemostasis. These actions may explain how soluble CD39 can
inhibit microvascular thrombosis and confer cerebroprotection in
ischemic stroke without worsening intracerebral hemorrhage
(Kohler et al., 2007; Marcus et al., 1991, 2005; Moeckel Douglas
et al., 2011).

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, combination of r-tPA and APT102 reduces mortality rate, decreases cerebral infarct volume, improves neurological deﬁcit scores, and prevents r-tPA-induced hemorrhage
transformation in our clinical relevant ischemic stroke model in
aged female rats. APT102 can extend the therapeutic window out
to at least 6 h by reducing r-tPA-induced intracerebral hemorrhage
following MCAO.
