Background: Drug-induced hypothermia reduces brain damage in animal stroke
models and is an undiscovered potential in human stroke treatment. We studied hypothermia induced by the serotonergic agonists S14671 (1-[2-(2-thenoylamino)
ethyl]-4[1-(7- methoxynaphtyl)]piperazine) and ipsapirone in a rat stroke model
and in man by literature meta-analysis. Methods: Rats had 60 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and then 7 days of survival. Body temperatures
were monitored for 22 hours. Thirty minutes after MCAO, 1 group (n 5 9) received
bolus of S14671 (.75 mg/kg) and continuous infusion of .06 mg/kg hour21 S14671
for 20 hours. Other MCAO rats (n 5 7) had bolus of ipsapirone (.75 mg/kg) and
continuous infusion of .25 mg/kg hour21 ipsapirone for 3 hours. Controls (n 5 9;
n 5 5) received similar amounts of vehicle as bolus and continuous infusion for
20 hours/3 hours. Additional controls of the S14761 effect in MCAO were performed as previously mentioned (n 5 10) but with rats kept normothermic by a
heating lamp for 22 hours. Finally, a meta-analysis of ipsapirone-induced hypothermia in man was included. Results: Infarct volumes were reduced by 50% in hypothermic rats versus controls (P , .05). S14671 rats kept normothermic did not
show infarct reduction (P . .05). The body temperature after stroke was reduced
1.0-3.0 C compared with controls for 20 hours with S14671 treatment and for 6 hours
with ipsapirone treatment. In humans, ipsapirone reduced temperature in average
with .55 C ranging between .1-1.4 C. Conclusions: 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor
1A (5HT1A) agonists significantly reduce infarct volumes in MCAO rats primarily
because of the hypothermic drug effect. 5HT1A agonists may be introduced to
reduce body temperatures rapidly and prepare patients for further therapeutic
hypothermia. Key Words: Regulated hypothermiaâ€”serotonin receptorsâ€”brain
ischemiaâ€”infarct sizeâ€”rat.

discharge, a 15-mm difference in computed tomography
scan infarct size and an 80% difference in mortality.1 In
other words, after stroke in man, small reductions in
body core temperatures were associated with improved
outcome. Other investigations have also found that hypothermia can reduce brain damage.2-6
In current treatment of human stroke, forced hypothermia by forcing body temperatures below the central thermoregulatory set point is the only used method for
achieving hypothermia.7 Unfortunately, the therapeutic
benefit of forced hypothermia is opposed by homeostatic
mechanisms resulting in physiologic stress and decreased
efficacy. Alternatively, regulated hypothermia by downregulation of endogenous thermoregulation may be a better method to achieve therapeutic efficacy without severe
adverse events. Regulated hypothermia through pharmacologic modulation of the hypothalamic set point temperature is mild, gentle, and self-limiting in animal models.8
Recently, we investigated drug-induced hypothermia
using a dopaminergic compound in rats to prove the principle that hypothermia in itself is a valid and effective
treatment regarding infarct reductions.9 In those extensive experiments, conditioning rats with hypothermia
before or up to 3 hours after stroke permanently diminished brain infarcts.9 This current investigation is an
extension of these results in rats to investigate if similar
infarct reductions can be found using serotonergic
5HT1A agonists causing hypothermia. Furthermore,
among clinically approved drugs with hypothermic
adverse events, there may be obvious candidates for hypothermic stroke treatment among serotonergic 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (5HT1A) agonists.10 The
advantages of these drugs are as follows: (1) they are
already approved for patient treatment; (2) they can
reduce temperature instantly when the patient is picked
up by the emergency personnel; (3) they can be used anywhere independent of sophisticated cooling equipment;
(4) they only induce mild regulated hypothermia, that
is, self-limiting within hours; (5) they may prolong the
therapeutic time window for other treatments; and (6)
they prepare for cold-salineâ€“induced hypothermia at the
hospital by lowering the shivering threshold.
To emphasize these arguments, we have investigated hypothermia induced by the serotonergic agonists ipsapirone
and S14671 (1-[2-(2-thenoylamino)ethyl]-4[1-(7- methoxynaphtyl)]piperazine) in a rat ischemic stroke model. These
compounds have been associated with high potency and efficacy in promoting hypothermia.11-16 Additionally, a
literature meta-analysis on the hypothermic effect of these
drugs in humans was performed to investigate if results
from rats could be extended to humans.

Methods
This study was approved and conducted according to
guidelines by the Animal Research Committee of Copen-

hagen University (J. No. 2006/561-1263). All procedures
including steps to eliminate animal suffering were carried
out in accordance with the guidelines of the University of
Copenhagen, Denmark.

Animals
Male Wistar Hannover rats, approximately 3 months
old and weighing approximately 330 g, were used in all
experiments. Animals were housed 2 per cage under
12/12 hours light/dark cycle with free access to water
and food. A total of 40 of 44 animals were included in
the study.
All animals had surgery and euthanization by the same
surgeon who subsequently handed over all brains and
physiologic data with an anonymous experimental number. A technician cut and stained the brain sections and
marked them with the experimental number. Measurement of brain infarcts were done by someone different
from the surgeon and the technician. Finally, yet another
person prepared results and figures according to codes
and experimental numbers.

Drug Dosages and Experimental Groups
Drugs or vehicle were prepared fresh before each
experimental day by the technician and coded before being handed over to the surgeon. Drugs and vehicle were
administrated blinded and randomly. In the S14671 experiments with temperature clamp, the technician turned
on the temperature clamp 30 minutes after MCAO right
when animals were left by the surgeon in the animal holding room.
For the ipsapirone final experiments, MCAO rats
(n 5 7) had an intravenous (IV) bolus injection of ipsapirone (.75 mg/kg) and a continuous infusion of .25 mg/kg
hour21 ipsapirone for 3 hours. Saline controls (n 5 5)
received similar amounts of vehicle as bolus and as
continuous infusion for 3 hours.
For the S14671 final experiments, 1 group (n 5 9)
received a subcutaneous (SC) bolus of S14671 (.75 mg/
kg) and a continuous infusion of .06 mg/kg hour21
S14671 for 20 hours. Another group of animals (n 5 10)
had their temperature clamped between 36.5-37.5 C
while receiving the same S14671 treatment. Saline controls (n 5 9) received similar amounts of vehicle as bolus
and as continuous infusion for 20 hours.
Based on published dose-response studies for hypothermia in rodents treated with S14671 and ipsapirone,11-16 and previous9 experiences combining bolus
and continuous drug infusion, we performed preliminary
dose-response studies on 18 rats for ipsapirone and 10
rats for S14671, guiding us to choose the previously
mentioned doses for final experiments. For ipsapirone,
dosages between IV bolus of 15-.75 mg/kg and continuous infusions over 3.5-20 hours of dosages between
.75-.25 mg/kg hour21 were tested. The drug was always

DRUG-INDUCED HYPOTHERMIA IMPROVE STROKE OUTCOME

administered 30 minutes after MCAO to mirror the clinical situation. In Figure 1, graphs illustrate results corresponding to ipsapirone as follows: (Fig 1, A) bolus
15 mg/kg IV 1 .75 mg/kg hour21 IV in 22 hours; (Fig 1,
B) bolus 6 mg/kg IV 1 .3 mg/kg hour21 IV in 22 hours;
(Fig 1, C) bolus 3 mg/kg IV 1 .15 mg/kg hour21 IV in
22 hours; (Fig 1, D) bolus 1.5 mg/kg IV 1 .08 mg/kg
hour21 IV in 22 hours; and (Fig 1, E) bolus .75 mg/kg
IV 1 .25 mg/kg hour21 IV over 3.5 hours. Similar for
S14671, bolus SC between .3 mg/kg and 1.8 mg/kg and
continuous IV infusions over 22 hours of dosages between
.03 mg/kg hour21 and .25 mg/kg hour21 were tested.
Again the drug was always administered 30 minutes after
MCAO to mirror the clinical situation. In Figure 2, graphs
illustrate results corresponding to S14671 as follows: (Fig
2, A) .3 mg/kg SC 1 .03 mg/kg hour21 IV in 22 hours;
(Fig 2, B) .75 mg/kg SC 1 .06 mg/kg hour21 IV in
22 hours; (Fig 2, C) 1.2 mg/kg SC 1 .12 mg/kg hour21
IV in 22 hours; and (Fig 2, D) 1.8 mg/kg SC 1 .25 mg/
kg hour21 IV in 22 hours.

Surgery
Anesthesia was induced by brief exposure to 3% halothane in a N2O/O2 (2:1) mixture. The rats were intubated
and further mechanically ventilated (New England Instruments Inc, South Natick, MA) during surgery with
.5%-1% halothane in N2O/O2 (2:1). Before incisions in
skin and periost, areas were infiltrated and covered
with lidocaine (20 mg/mL).
A thermosensor radio pill (TA-FA20; Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN) was surgically placed in the
peritoneal cavity of all rats for continuous recording of
body temperature after surgery (Physio Tel Receiver

RPC-1; Data Sciences International). After surgery this
radio pill did not hinder animal movements and was
used to measure temperatures, when rats were in their
cages. In the 36.5-37.5 C temperature clamp studies, the
recording device further regulates (on/off) a fan and
heating lamp placed above the animal, such that a temperature below 36.5 C turned on the heating lamp and a
temperature above 37.5 C turned on the fan.
The femoral vein was canalized for continuous drug
infusion initiated 30 minutes after MCAO.
The femoral artery was canalized for monitoring of
PCO2, PO2, blood gasses, electrolytes, and blood glucose
(Radiometer ABL555; Radiometer Medical, BrÃ¸nshÃ¸j,
Denmark) before, during, and immediately after surgery.
During MCAO or sham surgery, all rats subjected to
MCAO were placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf
Instruments, Tujunga, CA), and then a subtemporal craniotomy using sterile procedures for exposure of the left
middle cerebral artery was performed.8,17
The arcus zygomaticus was trephined with an air driven
drill, and the main trunk of the middle cerebral artery was
exposed and clamped distal to the striatal trunk for 60 minutes with a microsurgical hook guided by a micromanipulator (David Kopf Instruments). The cranial window was
constantly covered with saline heated to 37.0 C throughout
the operation. Reperfusion was established by removal of
the hook around the middle cerebral artery, and the halothane anesthesia was then turned off. Reflow was assured
visually through the surgical microscope before animals
were removed from the stereotaxic frame and ventilated
with medical air until spontaneous respiration occurred
(within first 10-15 minutes after halothane). During this recovery period, incisions were quickly sutured after the skin
was infiltrated with lidocaine (20 mg/mL).

Rectal temperatures and mean arterial blood pressure
were measured during surgery in all rats. Rectal temperature was monitored and kept within 36.5-37.5 C during
the operation with a thermostatic feedback heating lamp.
Then, when the animals were out of surgery and placed in
their cages, body core temperature was collected every 2 minutes during the next 22 hours from the radio pill implanted
in the abdomen to a radio receiver and stored on a computer.

Tissue Sampling and Stereological Estimation of Infarct
Size
All rats were killed under deep anesthesia (3% halothane in 2:1 N2O/O2) by transcardial perfusion with 4%
phosphate-buffered formalin (pH 5 7.2). The brains
were removed and further postfixed in formalin solution
for 24 hours at 4 C, then dehydrated and embedded in
paraffin for coronal sectioning. At 100-mm intervals, 10mm thick coronal sections were collected and stained
with cresyl violet. Infarct size was quantified directly by
computerized stereological examination (CAST-GridÃ’;
Olympus, Albertslund, Denmark) according to the principles of Bonaventura Francesco Cavalieri adjusted to modern guidelines.17 Briefly, the area of surviving tissue in the
infarcted hemisphere is subtracted from the area of the
contralateral noninfarcted hemisphere to get the infarct
area used for volume calculationâ€”hereby the influence
of both edema and shrinkage becomes negligible.

â€˜â€˜Ipsapirone 1 body temperatureâ€™â€™ was performed. This
investigation was important to examine and evaluate the
feasibility of translating our animal results for human treatments. From each paper the reduction in body core temperature was registered and the individual papers were
weighted in a forest plot according to number of individuals in experiments. Only studies indicating exact values
were included whereas studies presenting graphs with
values difficult to read in exact figures were excluded.

Statistical Analysis
Unless otherwise stated, results are described as
mean 6 standard deviation. P values less than .05 were
considered significant. Differences in physiologic data
were analyzed using analysis of variance. Differences in
infarct volumes between groups were analyzed using
one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey test. Estimation of sample sizes in the MCAO model experiments
was predicted from our previous results.8 If alpha error
level (confidence level) and beta error level (statistical power) were 5% and 50%, respectively, groups required
n 5 4; and if alpha and beta were 5% and 20%, respectively, groups required a sample size of n 5 9 to show significant differences in infarct size. Meta-analysis was
statistically handled by using a forest plot.

Results
Drug-induced Hypothermia

Meta-analysis of Ipsapirone and S14671 Effects in
Humans
To investigate if ipsapirone and S14671 had a hypothermic effect in humans, a search in PubMed (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) using the key words â€˜â€˜ipsapirone and S14671 1 human 1 hypothermiaâ€™â€™ and

Drug doses for hypothermia were guided from preliminary dose escalation studies. A dose corresponding to
curve E (Fig 1) was chosen for the ipsapirone experiments
and corresponding to curve B (Fig 2) for the S14671 experiments. The standard doses used in experiments are indicated previously in the methods section. The initial dose

DRUG-INDUCED HYPOTHERMIA IMPROVE STROKE OUTCOME

studies also showed that drug infusions beyond 3 hours
for ipsapirone and beyond less than 20 hours for S14671
did not prevent the body core temperature from returning
to normal within hours, that is, drug-induced hypothermia was self-limiting.
The temperature registration during the first 20 hours after experimental stroke with doses as described in the
methods section is shown in Figure 3 for ipsapirone and
in Figure 4 for S14671. Body core temperatures were returning to normal levels at greater than 3 hours and less than
20 hours when drug infusions were discontinued, respectively. Figure 4 also includes the average temperature for
those animals treated with S14671 and temperature
clamped between 36.5-37.5 C with a thermoregulated heating lamp and fan. The temperature clamp prevented the
initial fall in body core temperature (compared with
vehicle), which relates to the time after surgery when animals are slowly waking up and begin to move around.
Body core temperatures were automatically monitored
and registered on a computer each second minute
throughout the first 22 hours after MCAO. The hypothermic
impact is the area under the curve beneath, for example,
36.5 C. Alternatively, the average temperature throughout
the 20 hours administration of S14671 was 35.9 6 1.3 C,
the saline control 37.9 6 .8 C, and the S14671
temperature-clamped group 37.3 6 .3 C. The average temperature in the drug-induced hypothermic group was lower
than in the saline group (P , .05), whereas there was no significant temperature differences between the saline group
and the S14671 temperature-clamped group.

Ischemic Infarction
All animals subjected to 60 minutes of MCAO
and 7 days of survival had cortical infarcts in the left

hemispheres without affecting the subcortical temperature regulating structures in the hypothalamus. Infarcts
in the ipsapirone group measured 18.2 6 9.6 mm3
compared with 36.7 6 5.9 mm3 in the saline control group
(P , .05, Fig 5). This difference corresponded to a 50%
reduction in infarct volume after regulated hypothermic
treatment (Fig 5).
Infarcts in the S14671 group were estimated to
19.8 6 6.9 mm3 and to 40.1 6 10.6 mm3 in the corresponding saline-treated control group (P , .05), corresponding
to a 50% reduction in infarct volume after regulated hypothermia (Fig 6). Finally, the S14671-treated group with the
temperature clamped between 36.5-37.5 C had infarcts
measuring 30.6 6 7.8 mm3 (P ..05 as compared with controls; Fig 6).

Animals and Physiologic Variables
Four rats died during surgery before drug administration and were not further investigated. Variations between experimental groups of interischemic physiologic
data corresponding to pCO2, pO2, sodium, potassium,
pH, glucose, body temperature, and mean arterial blood
pressure during operation were not statistically significant (data not shown).

Meta-analysis of Ipsapirone and S14671 Effects in
Humans
A forest plot was produced and showed that central
body core temperatures were reduced in average with
.55 C within ranges of .1-1.4 C (Fig 7).10,18-23 One study
was represented twice, because this study comprised 2
ipsapirone study groups of 15 individuals each.19 Thus
in all of the 7 ipsapirone human studies, ipsapirone was

In this period, the animals slowly get back on their
feet and start moving and thereby through
increased muscle activity restore normophysiologic body temperature.

tested in 8 groups each containing from 6 to 26 individuals (with an average of 14 individuals).

Discussion
In our animal experiments, 5HT1A agonists reduced
body core temperatures between 1.0 C and 3.0 C for up
to 20 hours after experimental ischemic stroke resulting

in a 50% infarct reduction 1 week after the insult. As
infarct reduction was insignificant when the hypothermic
effect was abolished by keeping the body core temperature between 36.5 C and 37.5 C throughout the 20 hours
of S14671 administration, we suggest that the therapeutic
effect is primarily caused by hypothermia and not by
other beneficial drug effects. In a clinical perspective,
these results are interesting. Our forest plot on temperature reduction in humans after administration of the
5HT1A agonist ipsapirone shows a drop ranging between

.4 C and 1.4 C with an average reduction of .55 C. According to the patient study, even this mild temperature
reduction may improve outcome in human stroke.1 It
should be noted that we could only find results on hypothermia in humans after ipsapirone treatment in 7
different investigations,10,18-23 thereby limiting the
available knowledge. In addition, the dosages of
ipsapilone used were either .3 mg/kg10,18,19,21-23 or
.5 mg/kg.20 With only 2 doses tested, it was not possible
to evaluate any doseâ€“response relationship upon human
body temperatures. Furthermore, it should be noted
that although ipsapirone may provide hypothermia in
humans, this compound is not approved for temperature
modulation in humans and needs further testing.
Our results add to a large number of experimental
studies that indicate the benefit of hypothermia in cerebral ischemia.8,9,17,24 In association with our previous
extensive experiments using a dopaminergic agonistâ€”
including induction of hypothermia with a delay for up
to 3 hours and long-term survival studies9â€”results
show that both dopaminergic and serotonergic compounds induce hypothermia and greatly reduce brain
damage after stroke in animals. Starting 5HT1A agonistâ€™s
treatment 30 minutes after stroke in this investigation is
a limitation of the study, although the effect of hypothermia provided at a later time point has been shown in a
previous study.9 Another shortcoming of the present
study may be providing measures of infarct volumes
without the associated behavioral outcomes. This
approach was chosen because of a number of studies
showing a positive correlation of infarct size and functional outcome, for example, regarding motor functions.25
We have turned our attention to 5HT1A agonists as they
are well tolerated in humans and are able to induce hypothermia in humans without significant side effects.27
5HT1A agonists such as ipsapirone and flesinoxan induce
a reduction of core body temperature from .5 C to 1 C in
humans27,28 in accordance with our meta-analysis (Fig 7).
In our animal experiments, hypothermia was also

2885

induced by S14671, which has exceptional in vivo potency: 10-fold more potent than 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-npropylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and 100-fold more
potent than flesinoxan and buspirone. Furthermore,
S14671, as a 5HT1A agonist, has shown higher efficacy
compared with ipsapirone that may be associated with
more marked actions. There is also the possibility of differential recruitment of specific cellular cascades involved
in mediating hypothermia (biased signaling), which remains to be defined.29-33
Neuroprotective effects of ipsapirone and S14671 unrelated to hypothermia are possible but undetected in our
study. In a more recent stroke study in rats, the hypothermic neuroprotection of a dopaminergic agonist was permanent (measured at 90 days poststroke), but this
neuroprotection was also completely abolished by
removing hypothermia.9 For S14761, we also removed hypothermia using a similar method, but although a numerical 25% reduction in infarct size was observed, statistics
indicated that other beneficial effects besides hypothermia were insignificant. We cannot, in the present study,
exclude that S14671 has other less significant neuroprotective effects than hypothermia. This may even be
more significant for ipsapirone, as this drug has demonstrated
neuroprotection
from
ethanol-associated
apoptosis34 and reduced cell death if started 15 minutes
before ischemia in a dose-dependent manner. Also ipsapirone along with ketanserin led to a dose-dependent additive effect by up to 83% preservation of hippocampal
CA1 cells.35 5HT1A agonists have shown neuroprotection
without temperature reductionâ€”the 5HT1A agonist repinotan being a good example.36 The temperature clamp
studies we perform are proof of principle to illustrate
the significance of drug-induced hypothermia in our
model. This may, as we did for cannabinoid-induced hypothermia,17 isolate the hypothermic component from
other neuroprotective effects, or, as in the present study,
indicate the existence of such possibilities. However,
because the scope of the present investigation is to advocate for the use of clinically approved drugs with hypothermic adverse effects in acute stroke treatment, the
line of neuroprotection without temperature reduction
was not further elaborated. But it all helps, and further
neuroprotective effects besides hypothermia would only
add positively to our object: early and initial druginduced hypothermic neuroprotection that additionally
prepare the patient against shivering during cold-salineâ€“induced hypothermia in hospital.
S14671 and ipsapirone are promising candidates in preclinical trials because they are used in experimental
models of humans to induce a typical 5HT1A agonistâ€“
mediated hypothermia.27,28,37 Unfortunately, the 5HT1A
agonist repinotan did not demonstrate efficacy when it
was given to acute ischemic stroke patients.36 In spite of
robust preclinical data suggesting neuroprotection, the
further development of repinotan in acute ischemic stroke

was discontinued. It is noteworthy that hypothermia
was not at all in focus in this clinical trial. Repinotan in
rats reduces body temperature by 2.5 C in a typical
dose- and time-dependent manner.38 Other authors
conclude that combining repinotan treatment with hypothermia may produce greater beneficial effects in
ischemic stroke than either treatment alone.39
Despite promising knowledge, therapeutic hypothermia is still lacking clinical support when it comes to
both forced and regulated hypothermia.26 Skepticism is
still prevailing in the clinic, primarily because more information is needed regarding the optimal depth, timing,
and duration of hypothermia, the role of sedatives and
paralytics during cooling, the optimal rewarming rate after cooling, and the optimal techniques for inducing hypothermia.
Our prime message is in a translational stroke therapeutic perspective to advocate for the use of 5HT1A agonists such as ipsapirone and S14671 or low-dose
buspirone16 with meperidine at the time first responders
pick up the stroke patient. This would at least prepare
the patient for forced hypothermia in hospital by
lowering the shivering threshold and introduce the beneficial effects of mild hypothermia as early as possible.
These drugs should be administrated in safe and â€˜â€˜as hypothermic as possibleâ€™â€™ doses without harming other
treatments at the hospitalâ€”at best they could expand
the therapeutic window for other treatments. Adverse
events at temperatures of 35 C in drug-induced hypothermia may include pneumonia and coagulopathy, but
the drugs in scope are unlikely to harm subsequent
thrombolysis or increase the frequency of pneumonia.40-43
We conclude from animal stroke experiments that
S14671 and ipsapirone induce hypothermic neuroprotection. These positive results deserve further investigations
and may extend their use to early acute stroke patients for
treatment at the time of pick up by emergency personnel.
