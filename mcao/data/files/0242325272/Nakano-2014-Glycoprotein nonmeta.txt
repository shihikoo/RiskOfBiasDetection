Abstract—Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B
(GPNMB) is a type I transmembrane protein reported to have
neuroprotective eﬀects in the neurodegenerative disease
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We investigated whether
GPNMB is also neuroprotective against brain ischemia–
reperfusion injury (IRI). Focal ischemia/reperfusion injury
was induced via ﬁlament middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) for 2 h, followed by reperfusion upon withdrawal of
the ﬁlament. We assessed the neuroprotective eﬀects of
GPNMB using transgenic (Tg) mice which over expressing
GPNMB or recombinant GPNMB which has the sequence of
human extracellular GPNMB. The results showed that
GPNMB was up-regulated after IRI, and that genomic overexpression of GPNMB signiﬁcantly ameliorated infarct
volume. Next, we investigated the protective mechanisms of
GPNMB via Western blotting and immunohistochemistry
(IHC). Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and protein kinase B (Akt), were
increased in the GPNMB Tg group according to Western blotting data. IHC analysis showed that GPNMB was expressed
not only in neurons, but also in astrocytes, produced labeling
patterns similar to that in human brain ischemia. Furthermore, recombinant GPNMB also decreased infarction
volume. These results indicate that GPNMB protected neurons against IRI, and phosphor-Akt and phosphor-ERK might
be a part of the protective mechanisms, and that the neuroprotective eﬀect of GPNMB was seemingly induced by the
extracellular sequence of GPNMB. In conclusion, these
ﬁndings indicate that GPNMB has neuroprotective eﬀects

INTRODUCTION
Stroke has been the fourth most common cause of death
in recent years, and continues to have a high mortality
rate (Murphy et al., 2011). Despite numerous clinical trials
and basic experiments, no ‘‘neuroprotective therapies’’
have successfully been approved. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) is a type I transmembrane protein that is also known as Osteoactivin
Dendritic Cell–Heparin Integrin Ligand, or Hematopoietic
Growth Factor Inducible Neurokinin-1 type, and was
initially cloned from poorly metastatic melanoma cells as
a regulator of tumor growth (Weterman et al., 1995). The
pathological roles of GPNMB in cancer tissues include
inducing invasion, suppressing the immune system, causing angiogenesis, and enhancing cell adhesion (Maric
et al., 2013). GPNMB is also implicated in diﬀerentiation
and functioning of osteoclasts (Ripoll et al., 2008) and
osteoblasts (Abdelmagid et al., 2008), impairment of
T-cell activation (Chung et al., 2007), and regulation of
degeneration/regeneration of extracellular matrix in skeletal muscles (Ogawa et al., 2005). In addition, GPNMB
helps regulate the invasion and metastasis of several cancers, including uveal melanoma (Williams et al., 2010),
glioma (Rich et al., 2003), breast cancer (Rose et al.,
2007), hepatocellular carcinoma (Onaga et al., 2003),
and cutaneous melanoma (Tse et al., 2006). In the central
nervous system, GPNMB is expressed in microglia and
macrophages, where it plays an important role in the
regulation of inﬂammatory responses (Huang et al.,
2012). In addition, we have recently reported that GPNMB
has neuroprotective functions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and can suppress cell death of the motor
neurons (Tanaka et al., 2012). Regarding pathophysiology of ischemia, GPNMB was found to induce autophagy,
and to be protective in kidney ischemia (Li et al., 2010).
Furthermore the GPNMB gene was notably up-regulated

in young, but not aged, rats following stroke (Buga et al.,
2012). However no reports relate to the detailed involvement of GPNMB in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury
(IRI). We hypothesize that GPNMB would be protective
against IRI, and herein investigate the putative neuroprotective eﬀects of GPNMB, and if present the mechanisms
mediating these eﬀects.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
The experimental design and all procedures were in
accordance with the Animal Research: Reporting in Vivo
Experiments guidelines, and were approved by the
animal experiment committees of Gifu Pharmaceutical
University. Mice were randomized, and the scientists
were blinded to group. All eﬀorts were made to minimize
both the suﬀering and the number of animals used.
Pharmacological experiments were performed using
male BDF1 mice aged 6–10 weeks (Japan SLC Ltd.,
Shizuoka, Japan). Male and female GPNMB transgenic
(Tg) mice in age-matched 6–10 weeks were used for
experiments. Animals (weighing 22–28 g) were housed at
24 ± 2 under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on from 7:00
to 19:00 h).
Focal cerebral ischemia mouse model
The ﬁlament middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
model was used for induction of focal ischemia, as
described previously (Hara et al., 1997). Anesthesia was
induced using 2.0–3.0% isoﬂurane (Mylan, Canonsburg,
PA, USA), and maintained using 1.0–1.5% isoﬂurane (both
in 70% NO2/30% O2) delivered via an animal general anesthesia machine (Soft Lander; Sin-ei Industry Co. Ltd.,
Saitama, Japan). Body temperature was maintained at
37.0–37.5 °C with the aid of a heating pad and heat lamp.
After a midline skin incision, the left common carotid artery
was exposed, and its branches were occluded. An 8–0
nylon monoﬁlament (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) coated
with a mixture of provil novo (Heraeus, Hanau, German)
was introduced into the left internal carotid artery through
the external carotid artery stump, so as to occlude the origin
of the middle cerebral artery. After 2 h of occlusion, the animal was re-anesthetized brieﬂy, and reperfusion was
achieved via withdrawal of the ﬁlament. Just after reperfusion, the mice were kept in the preoperative state (room
temperature; 24 ± 2 °C) until sampling.
Exclusion criteria were set before the experiment:
Animals that died by excessive anesthesia or procedural
problems that occurred during operations, or that died up
to sampling after operations. Additional exclusion criteria
included: Failure of MCAO/reperfusion, animals with no
core area infarct, in which cerebral blood ﬂow was not
decreased by over 40%, in which the nylon ﬁlament could
not be withdrawn, and in which the nylon ﬁlament had
been lost at the time of reperfusion were excluded.
GPNMB Tg mice. GPNMB Tg mice were provided by
Dr. Nikawa Takeshi (Tokushima University Health
Bioscience Graduate School, Tokushima, Japan) and

backcrossed with BDF1 mice, as described previously
(Furochi et al., 2007). To express GPNMB eﬀectively
in vivo, the BamHI/PmeI fragment of pcDNA3.1/V5-Histagged GPNMB was subcloned into an expression vector
containing the cytomegalovirus immediate-early enhancer chicken b-globin hybrid promoter. It provided a
transgene cassette composed of the cytomegalovirus
promoter and rabbit b-globin exons 2 and 3 linked to
V5-His-tagged GPNMB cDNA. The V5-His-tagged rat
GPNMB cDNA construct was injected into fertilized
BDF1 eggs for the production of Tg mice (Japan SLC).
The GPNMB Tgs with the highest expression were then
back-crossed into BDF1 mice.
Recombinant GPNMB treatment
Recombinant human osteoactivin/GPNMB {r-GPNMB
(R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA)}, which includes the
sequence of human GPNMB from Lys 23 to Asn 486,
was used for intraventricular administration. Mice were
injected contralaterally through intracerebroventricular
(i.c.v.) stereotactic injection (2 lL in the ventricle) with
r-GPNMB at 25 or 250 ng/ll, dissolved in phosphatebuﬀered saline (PBS; treated group, n = 6) or PBS
(control group, n = 6) just after ischemia–reperfusion.
PBS was essential for dissolution of GPNMB. Solutions
were freshly prepared just before the injection to avoid
decomposition of the protein.
Assessment of cerebral infarct
To analyze infarct volume, mice were euthanized using
isoﬂurane (Mylan) at 24 h after MCAO, and forebrains
were sectioned coronally into ﬁve slices (2 mm thick).
These were placed in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) (TTC; Sigma–Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO,
USA) at 37 °C for 30 min, and then ﬁxed in 10%
buﬀered formalin (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Digital images
of the caudal aspect of each slice were obtained using a
digital camera (Coolpix 4500, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
Infarct of ipsilateral hemisphere and contralateral
hemisphere areas was measured with image processing
software (Image-J ver. 1.43 h; National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), and infarct volume was
calculated as previously reported (Hara et al., 1997). As
mentioned above, the scientists were blinded to group in
these assessments.
Laser speckle blood ﬂow imaging
Changes in cerebral blood ﬂow were monitored using a
laser speckle blood ﬂow imaging system (LSFG-ANW;
Softcare, Ltd. Fukuoka, Japan) as described previously
(Ogishima et al., 2011). Animals were placed in the prone
position, the head skin was opened under anesthesia of
2.0–3.0% isoﬂurane, and body temperature was maintained at 36–37 °C. The brain was diﬀusely illuminated by
a semiconductor laser (780 nm), and scattered light was ﬁltered using a hybrid ﬁlter and detected by a CCD camera
positioned above the head. The hybrid ﬁlter was used to
detect only scattered light that had polarization perpendicular to the incident laser light, so that stable and speciﬁc

measurements were achieved. The raw speckle images
were recorded by video capture and were used to compute
speckle contrast, which corresponds to the number and
velocity of moving red blood cells. A color-coded blood ﬂow
image was obtained with the high-resolution mode
(638  480 pixels; one image) of the CCD. One blood ﬂow
image was generated by averaging numbers obtained from
20 consecutive raw speckle images. To avoid inﬂuence on
laser scattering related to the margin of the brain, blood
ﬂow in a region of interest at the center (approximately
0.5  0.5 mm) of the brain was obtained by using the software installed in a laser speckle blood ﬂow imaging system
(LSFG-ANW; Softcare, Ltd.). The color map images demonstrated relative blood ﬂow. Laser speckle values, relative
blood ﬂow ipsilateral ischemic cortex area and contralateral
ischemic cortex area were measured 22 h after ischemia–
reperfusion.
Western blotting
Mice were deeply anesthetized and decapitated at 22 h
after ischemia–reperfusion.
Brains were quickly removed and separated into the
ipsilateral side and the contralateral side. Tissues of the
infarct side were homogenized in 10 ml/g tissue ice-cold
RIPA buﬀer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, containing
150 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100,
protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture), and 10 lg of
protein sample was electrophoresed on a 5–20%
gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–polyacrylamide
gel (SuperSep Ace; Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka,
Japan). The separated proteins were subsequently
transferred to a polyvinylideneﬂuoride membrane
(Immobilon-P; Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA).
For Western blotting, the following primary antibodies
were used: Goat anti-GPNMB (1/2000; MILLIPORE,
Billerica, MA, USA), rabbit anti-phospho-ERK (1/2000;
Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit
anti-ERK (1/2000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit
anti-phospho-Akt (1/2000; Cell Signaling Technology),
rabbit anti-Akt (1/2000; Cell Signaling Technology), and
monoclonal anti-b-actin (Sigma–Aldrich Co.). The
secondary antibody was anti-goat IgG (1:5000, Thermo
Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL, USA) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000,
Thermo Scientiﬁc) or anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Pierce
Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). The band intensity
was measured using a Lumino imaging analyzer (LAS4000: Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Band intensity was
related to diﬀerences in expression level using Multi
Gauge software (Fuji Film).
Double-immunostaining
For double-immunostaining, frozen tissues from mice and
paraﬃn-embedded human specimens were used. For
mouse frozen tissue, sham-operated and ischemic mice
were injected with sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal;
50 mg/kg, i.p., Nissan Kagaku, Tokyo, Japan), then
perfused through the left ventricle with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buﬀer (PB; pH 7.4). Brains
were removed after 15 min perfusion ﬁxation at 4 °C, then
immersed in the same ﬁxative solution overnight at 4 °C.

125

They were then immersed in 25% sucrose in 0.1 M PB for
24 h, and ﬁnally frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
80 °C. Coronal sections (14 lm thick) of ﬁxed mouse
brain held at 20 °C were cut on a cryostat between
0.4 and 1.0 mm anterior to the bregma. Human specimens
were
deparaﬃnized
and
rehydrated
before
immunohistochemistry (IHC). The sections were blocked
with 10% horse serum in PBS, then incubated overnight at
4 °C with the following primary antibodies: Goat antiGPNMB antibody (1/100; MILLIPORE, Billerica, MA,
USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-microtubule-associated protein
2 (MAP2) antibody (1/100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA)
or monoclonal rabbit anti-GFAP (Glial ﬁbrillary acidic
protein) antibody (1/100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA). They were then incubated for 1 h with the
following secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 546 F-(ab0 )2
fragment of goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1/1000; Life
Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), Alexa Fluor 488
F-(ab0 )2 fragment of donkey anti-goat IgG (1/1000; Life
Technologies Corporation), and Hoechst 33342 dye (1/
1000; Life Technologies Corporation). The sections were
observed under a confocal microscope (FV10i, Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan).
Cell counts. Using a confocal microscope (FV10i,
Olympus), the number of neurons and astrocytes was
counted using image processing software (Image-J ver.
1.43 h; National Institutes of Health). To standardize the
measurements, two predesignated squares in the cortex
in sham and ischemia groups were counted and averaged.
Human tissue specimens
Human tissue specimens were recovered from patients
who had undergone surgery for reasons of clinical
necessity at the Department of Neurosurgery, Gifu
University Hospital (Gifu, Japan), as described previously
(Takagi et al., 2014). There were no additional interventions in the patients enrolled in this study. The use of surgical specimens for immunostaining was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Gifu University (#25–46),
and all patients or their representatives signed informed
written consent. The stroke patient was a woman in her
60s who suﬀered a large hemispheric infarct due to cardiogenic embolism and underwent internal and external
decompression 24 h after symptom onset because of brain
herniation. The tissue specimen was from temporal cortex
of the infarct hemisphere removed by decompressive surgery. The control patient was a woman in her 20s who presented with intractable epilepsy caused by cavernous
malformation in the temporal lobe, with no other signiﬁcant
medical history. Her neurological status was completely
normal with the exception of seizures. The patient underwent anterior temporal lobectomy, including the removal
of the vascular malformation. The tissue specimen was
from the histologically normal cortex of the removed temporal lobe.

RESULTS
Association of GPNMB and ischemic damage
We initially investigated whether GPNMB expression was
altered after IRI via Western blotting. Mice were subjected

to 2 h of ischemia followed by 22 h of reperfusion. As a
result, glycosylated GPNMB protein levels in post-stroke
animals were up-regulated signiﬁcantly compared to the
sham group at 22 h after IRI (Fig. 1A). Next, we
assessed the cell type-speciﬁc expression of GPNMB in
IRI using IHC. Double immunoﬂuorescence for GPNMB
and cell type-speciﬁc markers revealed that GPNMB
immunoreactivity was apparently colocalized with
both MAP2 and GFAP (Fig. 1B). The number of

control temporal lobe tissue. Scale bar = 10 lm.

double-labeled cells was signiﬁcantly greater in the periinfarct area versus the sham group (Fig. 1C). These
results showed that the level of GPNMB was elevated
not only in neurons, but also in astrocytes in IRI.
Association of GPNMB and human ischemic damage
Because no study had evaluated the activation of GPNMB
in human stroke, we assessed GPNMB immunoreactivity
in human brain specimens. The resected cerebral
ischemia specimens included both infarcted and periinfarct areas, with many neurons and glia surviving in the
peri-infarct
area.
Double
immunoﬂuorescence
demonstrated that GPNMB immunoreactivity colocalized
with both MAP2 and GFAP in the peri-infarct area
(Fig. 2), similarly to mouse IRI. On the other hand,
GPNMB was only minimally colocalized with MAP2 and
GFAP in the control samples (Fig. 2). Thus, GPNMB was
also found to be up-regulated in the peri-infarct region in
human ischemic stroke.
Eﬀect of GPNMB on cerebral ischemic damage
In order to investigate the neuroprotective eﬀect of
GPNMB against IRI, 2 h of MCAO and 22 h of
reperfusion was performed in GPNMB-over-expressing

Tg mice. There are no diﬀerences in terms of protective
eﬀects between male and female GPNMB Tg mice and
female infarct volume [male infarct volume: 32.2
mm3 ± 3.8 (n = 7) and female infarct volume: 35.9
mm3 ± 5.0 (n = 8)] (Data not shown). The infarct area
seen in coronal sections was decreased in the GPNMB
Tg group compared to wild-type (WT) controls (Fig. 3A).
GPNMB decreased the cerebral infarct area (Fig. 3B),
cerebral infarction volume by approximately 40% at 24 h
after cerebral ischemia (Fig. 3C). Brain swelling was not
altered (p = 0.1067) (Fig. 3D). Evaluating cerebral
blood ﬂow 24 h after ischemia using laser speckle
imaging, cerebral blood ﬂow in the ischemic area was
improved (Fig. 3E) compared to WT. These results
suggest that GPNMB suppressed neuronal cell death in
GPNMB Tg mice compared to the WT group.

The mechanism of protection by GPNMB
To determine the putative mechanism of the protective
eﬀect of GPNMB, we investigated the changes in the
phosphorylation of two proteins, extracellular signalregulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and Akt, by Western
blotting using the cerebral hemisphere specimens. GPNMB
signiﬁcantly increased the level of phospho-ERK1/2

dotted line indicates the area of infarction. GPNMB reduced on the cerebral infarct area (B) and total volume (C) (⁄p < 0.05, vs. WT, Student’s t-test,

(Fig. 4A) and phospho-Akt (Fig. 4B). Activation of ERK1/2
and Akt may play key roles in preventing brain damage
following IRI. These data suggest that GPNMB enhances
activity of survival factors such as Akt and ERK1/2,
protecting neurons from death in IRI.
Extracellular fragments of GPNMB and infarct volume
in mice
Finally, to examine which fragment of GPNMB can
improve cell survival in IRI, and to evaluate whether
administration of r-GPNMB can produce the same
beneﬁcial eﬀect as genomic over-expression, we
administrated (i.c.v.) extracellular fragments of GPNMB
in IRI model mice. Immediately after reperfusion,
treatment with 50 or 500 ng/ml of the extracellular
GPNMB fragment signiﬁcantly lessened cerebral infarct
damage (Fig. 5).

DISCUSSION
Currently, the only approved medicines for ischemic
stroke are thrombolytics represented by intravenous
administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator (Wardlaw et al., 2003), and anti-platelet

(Sandercock et al., 2014) or anticoagulant drugs
(Dumont et al., 2013) for prevention of relapses. No ‘‘neuroprotective’’ drug that can limit the cerebral infarct has
been approved, despite the need for novel therapeutic
interventions.
GPNMB is a type I transmembrane protein, which
increases cellular survival signals and thus promotes
tumor growth (Maric et al., 2013). In fact, our previous
study indicated that GPNMB ameliorated motor neuron
death in ALS (Tanaka et al., 2012). Motor neuron survival
was promoted when activated astrocytes secreted the
extracellular fragment of GPNMB, which protected
against neurotoxicity via the ERK1/2 and Akt pathways
(Tanaka et al., 2012). From these results, we speculated
that GPNMB might be applicable as a neuroprotective
factor in IRI.
Here, the expression of GPNMB was increased 24 h
after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (Fig. 1), and
infarct volume was decreased in GPNMB Tg mice
(Fig. 3) or in mice administered r-GPNMB (Fig. 5).
Hence, GPNMB has the potential to protect neurons
from focal IRI. This is the ﬁrst report demonstrating the
protective eﬀect of GPNMB against IRI in a mouse
model and to indicate that GPNMB might also have
neuroprotective eﬀects in human ischemic stroke.

reperfusion. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. (⁄p < 0.05 vs. WT, Student’s t-test, n = 8 to 10). Note that phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and
Akt was increased in response to GPNMB upregulation following cerebral infarct.

Our data demonstrated that GPNMB was highly
expressed in both neurons and astrocytes during the
acute phase of IRI, in the mouse as well as human
brain. It has been reported that astrocytes support
neuronal survival in several ways (Barreto et al., 2011).
These results suggest that GPNMB can both suppress
neuronal death directly and protect neurons by increasing
the survival of local neuron-supporting astrocytes.
Regarding
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
neuroprotection of GPNMB, reports indicate that
GPNMB up-regulates the activation of phospho-ERK
and phospho-Akt, inducing matrix metalloprotease-3
expression (Furochi et al., 2007) and blocking neurotoxicity (Tanaka et al., 2012). Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is known to decrease neuronal cell death in cerebral
ischemia and to enhance cell survival (Janelidze et al.,
2001; Noshita et al., 2001; Shioda et al., 2009). Therefore, we examined modulation of the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and Akt by GPNMB. Both ERK 1/2 and Akt
phosphorylation were enhanced in GPNMB Tg mice and
these data indicated that GPNMB might utilize the ERK
and Akt pathways to exert neuroprotective eﬀects
(Fig. 4A, B). We have previously reported that extracellular GPNMB enhanced survival signals including the PI3K/
Akt and MEK/ERK pathways, thus protecting cells from
neuronal degeneration (Tanaka et al., 2012). Besides, it
has been reported that activating ERK and Akt protects
brain ischemia damage (Kilic et al., 2006; Xie et al.,
2013). Given these previous results, it was not surprising

that r-GPNMB administration signiﬁcantly improved the
infarct volume (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the
extracellular fragment of GPNMB can exert the neuroprotective eﬀect of GPNMB in IRI and consequently improve
cerebral neuronal death.
In addition to this direct protective action, GPNMB is
reported to have an anti-inﬂammatory eﬀect (Chung
et al., 2007, 2011). The extracellular fragment of GPNMB
might suppress T-cell activation and proliferation, by binding to syndecan-4 on the surface of activated T cells
(Chung et al., 2011). Thus, GPNMB expression promotes
macrophage inﬁltration, which is thought to serve as a
compensatory response to promote tissue repair through
autophagy and phagocytosis of cell debris (Li et al.,
2010). Besides, it had been reported that post-stroke
gene expression in young vs. aged animals regarding
inﬂammation is diﬀerent (Buga et al., 2008, 2013, 2014;
Sieber et al., 2014). Inﬂammation-related genes, protein
tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C, prostaglandin E
synthase 3, transforming growth factor beta receptor 1,
IL-6, ribosomal protein S2 are up-regulated in aged rats
but not in young animals (Buga et al., 2013). And cerebral
ischemia in aging animals activates microglia and elevates pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF-a,
and decreases anti-inﬂammatory, IL-10 and IL-4. These
data displayed the age-related shift of inﬂammation activation potentiate neuroinﬂammation in cerebral ischemia

ischemia damage, especially in aged patients, and inhibition of macrophage inﬁltration by GPNMB was thought to
promote neuroprotection. However, further investigation
is needed to determine the relative import of the direct
and indirect mechanisms of GPNMB-mediated cell
survival.
In the present study, GPNMB has protective eﬀect
against IRI, however, there were some limitations.
Firstly, in this study the number of used mice was
small (n = 3–6). However, it is thought to be desirable
that the number of used animals is small from the
viewpoint of animal protection if the result could be
evaluated deﬁnitely. Of course, stroke damage is
variable, but as it is described, we have monitored the
extent of ischemia using laser doppler and made eﬀorts
not to cause variability as possible.
Secondly, administrating GPNMB intracerebroventricularly is not realistic to treat human stroke. But this
study indicated that activation of GPNMB suppressed

cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury. We could not
administrate GPNMB directly into ventricular, however, it
was thought to be an attractive target to activate
GPNMB for human stroke treatment. To translate these
results into stroke treatment, nextly we need to ﬁnd out
the new agent which activates GPNMB.

CONCLUSIONS
In the present study, GPNMB overexpression in Tg IRI
model mice ameliorated infarct volume. GPNMB
expression was identiﬁed in neurons as well as
astrocytes, in both mouse and human brains. In addition,
r-GPNMB and the extracellular fragment of GPNMB also
protected neurons from IRI in the mouse model. The part
of neuroprotective eﬀects of GPNMB might appear to
function via phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt.
Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that GPNMB
could be a new target for neuroprotection against IRI.
