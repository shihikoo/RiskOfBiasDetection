Background and Purpose—Prophylactic treatments that afford neuroprotection against stroke may emerge from the field
of preconditioning. Resveratrol mimics ischemic preconditioning, reducing ischemic brain injury when administered
2 days before global ischemia in rats. This protection is linked to silent information regulator 2 homologue 1 (Sirt1) and
enhanced mitochondrial function possibly through its repression of uncoupling protein 2. Brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) is another neuroprotective protein associated with Sirt1. In this study, we sought to identify the conditions
of resveratrol preconditioning (RPC) that most robustly induce neuroprotection against focal ischemia in mice.
Methods—We tested 4 different RPC paradigms against a middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke. Infarct volume
and neurological score were calculated 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Sirt1-chromatin binding was
evaluated by ChIP-qPCR. Percoll gradients were used to isolate synaptic fractions, and changes in protein expression
were determined via Western blot analysis. BDNF concentration was measured using a BDNF-specific ELISA assay.
Results—Although repetitive RPC induced neuroprotection from middle cerebral artery occlusion, strikingly one application
of RPC 14 days before middle cerebral artery occlusion showed the most robust protection, reducing infarct volume by
33% and improving neurological score by 28%. Fourteen days after RPC, Sirt1 protein was increased 1.5-fold and
differentially bound to the uncoupling protein 2 and BDNF promoter regions. Accordingly, synaptic uncoupling protein
2 level decreased by 23% and cortical BDNF concentration increased 26%.
Conclusions—RPC induces a novel extended window of ischemic tolerance in the brain that lasts for at least 14 days.
Our data suggest that this tolerance may be mediated by Sirt1 through upregulation of BDNF and downregulation of
uncoupling protein 2.   (Stroke. 2015;46:2293-2298. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.009876.)

Resveratrol is a polyphenol synthesized naturally in several
species of plants.4 The therapeutic potential of resveratrol has
been widely investigated in many pathological conditions,5
although the investigation of resveratrol as an agent in stroke
treatment is still in its infancy.
Similar to IPC, resveratrol preconditioning (RPC) induces
ischemic tolerance, at least in part, by activation of silent
information regulator 2 homologue 1 (Sirt1).3,6 Sirt1 is a versatile NAD+-dependent deacetylase that acts on both histone
and nonhistone proteins to regulate many biological processes. Additionally, Sirt1 has a host of neuroprotective properties in pathological states, such as neurological disorders.7
More recently, Sirt1 has been implicated in cerebral ischemia,
fostering ischemic tolerance through common targets, such
as HIF, PGC1α, and p53.8 Additional targets of Sirt1 include
mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a proton channel found in the inner mitochondrial membrane that uncouples
oxidative phosphorylation,6 and brain-derived neurotrophic

ith few and limited clinically approved treatments, ischemic stroke remains a devastating pathology that plagues
the world population.1 Our ability to predict those who are predisposed to or at risk for stroke has significantly improved in
recent years, making prophylactic treatment a viable option for
neuroprotection. There is an identifiable population in the millions that are at an increased risk for stroke and are ideal candidates for prophylactic therapeutic intervention. Indeed, studies
have demonstrated the immense potential of a prophylactic
approach, using forthcoming pharmacological agents derived
from the field of ischemic preconditioning (IPC).
IPC refers to the ability of a brief, nondamaging ischemic
episode to induce tolerance against a subsequent, damaging
ischemic insult.2 Ischemic tolerance is characterized to have
an early window of protection, which is activated immediately
and lasts for several hours, as well as a late window of protection, which is active 2 days later.2 Several pharmacological
agents can mimic the effects of IPC, including resveratrol.3

factor (BDNF),9 a growth factor involved in many neuronal
processes, including synaptic plasticity.
Our previous work demonstrates that RPC reduces ischemic
brain injury when administered 2 days before cardiac arrest
in rats6 as well as middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)
in mice.9a In terms of neuronal function, ischemic tolerance
was associated with an increase in Sirt1 activity, a decrease in
UCP2, and enhanced mitochondrial function in the hippocampus. The goal of this study was to identify the conditions of
RPC that most robustly induce neuroprotection against focal
cerebral ischemia in mice and investigate further the contribution of the Sirt1 signaling axis.

Animals and Treatments
All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of Miami and were in accordance
with institutional regulations. Eight- to 12-week-old C57Bl/6J male
mice obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (n=108) were randomly
assigned to different treatment groups. Mice were injected IP with
10 mg/kg transresveratrol (3,4′,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene; Sigma)
in 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma) and 0.9% saline (Hospira
Inc; RPC) or the control 1.5% DMSO and 0.9% saline (Veh). All
injections, experimental procedures, and analysis throughout this
study were conducted in a blinded fashion.

Focal Cerebral Ischemia by Reversible MCAo
Right-side MCAo was produced as previously described.10 Cerebral
blood flow was monitored using a Laser-Doppler (Perimed System,
Stockholm, Sweden) probe. MCAo was induced by inserting a silicone-coated 8-0 monofilament nylon surgical suture into the internal
carotid artery and circle of Willis via the proximal external carotid. After
60 minutes of MCAo, the suture was removed.

Neurological Scoring and Infarct Volume
Twenty-four hours after MCAo, animals were scored based on a
neurobehavioral battery,10 and infarct volume was quantified by TTC
staining11 as previously described.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation and Subsequent
Quantitative PCR
Mouse brain cortices were dissected, frozen, pulverized in liquid
nitrogen, and resuspended in cross-linking solution (1% formaldehyde). Nuclei were lysed, chromatin was sonicated to 200 to 500 bp
fragments, centrifuged, and diluted in ChIP dilution buffer. The sonicated, cleared chromatin supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation with 5 μg of anti-Sirt1 antibody or control IgG overnight at 4°C.
Beads were washed sequentially with 1 mL each of low salt wash,
high salt wash, LiCl wash, and TE wash. Beads were resuspended in
elution buffer and cross-linking was reversed. DNA was purified by
phenol–chloroform extraction and EtOH precipitation. Quantitative
real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green reagent (Roche) in
the LightCycler 480 II (Roche Applied Science) and analyzed with
the ΔΔCT method. DNA-relative enrichment was determined by normalizing to input genomic DNA and preserum IgG as background.

Isolation of Synaptosomes via Percoll
Gradient Fractionation
Percoll gradients were used to isolate synaptosomes according to
Dunkley and colleagues12 with slight modifications. Mice were decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia and their cortices immersed in isolation

medium at 4°C. Tissue was chopped, homogenized, diluted to give 10%
wt/vol and centrifuged at 500g for 5 minutes (Sorvall RC5 centrifuge,
Newton CT). The supernatant was layered on a Percoll (Sigma) gradient
and centrifuged at 32 500g for 5 minutes. Synaptosomes were collected
between 23% to 15% and 15% to 10% Percoll junctions, washed once
with isolation medium by centrifugation at 15 000g for 10 minutes and
once with 0.25 mol/L sucrose. The final pellet was resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and processed for protein analysis
according to the Western blot protocol.

Western Blotting
Mouse cortices were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (BioRad).
Equal amounts of protein were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels
and transferred to a nitro-cellulose membrane (BioRad). The next steps
in order were block 2 hours at room temperature; probe with primary
antibody overnight at 4°C; incubate secondary antibody for 1 hour at
RT; addition of substrate for 3 minutes; protein bands detected with
x-ray film (Denville Scientific). Films were analyzed densitometrically
using Image J. Two normalized values (for the same sample) from different blots were averaged to give the values presented.

BDNF ELISA Assay
BDNF concentration was quantified using a ChemiKineTM BDNF
Sandwich ELISA Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Statistical Analysis
All data are represented as mean±SEM. For statistical analysis,
Student’s t-tests were used to compare differences between 2 groups.
Differences were considered significant at the 95% confidence interval (*P<0.05, **P<0.01).

Results
Repetitive RPC Treatment Confers Ischemic
Tolerance Against Focal Ischemia
Based on our previous findings that RPC induces ischemic tolerance when administered 2 days before injury,3,6 we sought to
evaluate RPC in the context of focal cerebral ischemia using the
MCAo mouse model. Our first hypothesis was that repetitive
RPC over an extended period of time induces ischemic neuroprotection. To this end, mice were given RPC or Veh every other
day for 14 days before MCAo, mimicking the standard preconditioning paradigm repeated 7 times (Figure 1A). Animals that
did not display ≥80% reduction in cerebral blood flow were
excluded—full documentation of cerebral blood flow, exclusion, and mortality can be found in Table. Compared with Veh,
RPC significantly reduced infarct volume by 20% (P<0.01,
Veh n=12, RPC n=12; Figure 1B). Next, we hypothesized that
increasing the frequency of RPC treatment could enhance this
protection. Thus, mice were given RPC or Veh every day for
14 days before MCAo (Figure 1C). Similar to every other day
treatment, everyday treatment significantly reduced infarct
volume by 27% compared with Veh (P<0.01, Veh n=12, RPC
n=14; Figure 1D). From this, we conclude that repetitive RPC
induces ischemic tolerance against focal ischemia.

RPC Induces a Novel Extended Window of Ischemic
Tolerance Against Focal Ischemia
Because there was no significant difference between the protection afforded by every other day and every day treatment,
we rationalized that perhaps less frequent RPC could also

was that intermittent RPC could induce an extended window of ischemic tolerance. To test this hypothesis, we used
a geometric growth pattern of intermittent RPC consisting of
4 applications at intervals of 1, 2, 4, and 8 days, with 14 days
between the last treatment and MCAo (Figure 2A). Strikingly,
compared with Veh, intermittent RPC significantly reduced
infarct volume by 24% (P<0.01, Veh n=15, RPC n=16;
Figure 2B). Before any conclusions can be drawn from this
intermittent RPC paradigm, an important distinction to make
is whether it is the culmination of 4 applications of RPC that
give rise to this long-lasting ischemic tolerance or if simply
one application of RPC can induce ischemic tolerance for this
extended period of time. To test this, mice were given RPC or
Veh once, 14 days before MCAo (Figure 2C). Remarkably,
one application of RPC 14 days before MCAo significantly
reduced infarct volume by 33% compared with Veh (P<0.01,
Veh n=9, RPC n=10; Figure 2D). To confirm that this reduction in infarct volume was accompanied by improved neurological performances, we calculated neurological score
24 hours after MCAo and found that compared with Veh, RPC
significantly improved this functional outcome measure by
28% (P<0.05; Figure 2D). From these results, we conclude
that a single application of RPC induces a novel extended window of ischemic tolerance that lasts for at least 14 days.

Given that Sirt1 is a well-established target of resveratrol and
that in our previous studies blockade of Sirt1 ablates ischemic
tolerance,3,6 we investigated whether changes in Sirt1 expression occurred in this extended window of ischemic tolerance.
Fourteen days after a single application of RPC, cortical Sirt1
levels were significantly increased 1.5-fold of Veh (P<0.01,
n=10; Figure 3A). To assess whether this increase had functional implications, we turned our attention to putative chromatin binding sites for Sirt1. Based on known interactions
with Sirt113,14 and our previous studies implicating BDNF9 and
UCP26 in ischemic tolerance, we evaluated Sirt1 binding to promoter regions within the BDNF and UCP2 genes. Chromatin

single application of RPC revealed that Sirt1 binding to both
the BDNF and UCP2 promoters was significantly enhanced,
2.66-fold and 1.14-fold, respectively (BDNF P<0.01, UCP2
P<0.05, n=3; Figure 3B). This enhancement was not seen in
Veh-treated mice. Accordingly, we found that cortical BDNF
levels were significantly increased by 27% (P<0.05, n=7)
and synaptic UCP2 levels were significantly decreased by
23% (P<0.05, n=6) compared with Veh 14 days after a single
application of RPC (Figure 3C and 3D). These data suggest
that Sirt1 may be modulating BDNF and UCP2 expression at
14 days where ischemic tolerance is observed.

Discussion
The major finding of this study—that a single application
of RPC can protect against focal ischemia 14 days later—
is both novel and intriguing. To our knowledge, this is the
first evidence that a single pharmacological preconditioning
treatment can induce a state of long-lasting ischemic tolerance. This is a new extended window of preconditioning
beyond the 2 to 3 day time point or classical late window
commonly studied.

In work before this study, evidence hinted that an extended
window may exist. In organotypic slices, we showed that one
application of IPC affords protection that lasts at least 4 days.3
Additionally, a paradigm of repetitive hypoxia preconditioning
(varying O2 exposure over 2 weeks) conferred protection from
focal ischemia for ≤2 months after treatment.15 Elucidating
the long-term effects of preconditioning will provide a framework for the development of novel clinical applications in the
future. The major argument for resveratrol’s immense potential is that it has already been deemed safe for clinical use in
humans.16
Resveratrol either directly or indirectly activates or upregulates Sirt1.17,18 Previously we have shown increased Sirt1
to be a common mechanism of preconditioning-mediated
protection, where protection was lost in the presence of the
Sirtuin inhibitor Sirtinol.3 The proposed acute mechanisms
for Sirt1-mediated ischemic tolerance include modulating the
neuroinflammatory response via NF-κB,19 reducing/inhibiting
proapoptotic factors, such as p53,20 as well as enhancing mitochondrial function via PGC1α21 and UCP2.6 Here, we found
Sirt1 to be upregulated at 14 days after a single RPC treatment. A chronic upregulation of Sirt1 could promote changes
in gene expression that are maintained overtime that give rise
to this extended window of ischemia tolerance. In line with
this notion, 14 days after RPC, we find enhanced Sirt1 binding
to UCP2 and BDNF promoter regions.
As mentioned earlier, Sirt1 is known to negatively regulate
UCP2 by binding directly to its promoter.14 This is supported
in our current study as we observed a decrease in synaptic
UCP2 protein levels. In our previous studies, we observed a
reduction in UCP2 2 days after RPC in rats where protection
from cardiac arrest was seen. Neuroprotection and decreased
UCP2 were also linked to enhanced mitochondrial efficiency.6
In another line of evidence, UCP2 knockout mice were found
to be resistant to permanent focal ischemia.22 In these mice,
protection was attributed to increased antioxidant defenses and
a reduction in oxidative damage. It should be noted that UCP2’s
effects in regards to cerebral ischemia are still somewhat controversial. Other groups have shown that overexpression of
UCP2 is also protective against cerebral ischemia23 and that
the same UCP2 knockout mice mentioned above were actually more susceptible to a model of transient focal ischemia.24
Discrepancies could be as a result of variation across species,
genetic compensation in knockout mouse models, the type of
ischemia model used, or choice of preconditioning agent.
Sirt1 is also known to upregulate BDNF expression; the
proposed mechanisms are indirect and include Sirt1 deacety­
lation of MeCP2 (which regulates expression of BDNF by
binding at its promoter)25 and Sirt1 inhibition of miR-134
expression (a micro-RNA that downregulates expression of
BDNF).13 In addition, binding of Sirt1 to the BDNF promoter
has been identified in the mouse cerebellum, suggesting that
a direct interaction might also occur.26 Moreover, BDNF
was decreased in the brains of Sirt1 null mice.27 BDNF is an
important growth factor that promotes survival and growth of
existing neurons, as well as the differentiation of new ones.
It also impacts synaptic plasticity and learning and memory.28
Our previous work shows enhanced BDNF as a mechanism

for ischemia tolerance after IPC or protein kinase C epsilon–
induced preconditioning,9 in which increased BDNF was
associated with a delay in anoxic depolarization. Another
group shows that intravenous BDNF administration after
ischemia improves recovery possibly through a mechanism
centered on neurogenesis.29 Given that all of these changes
seem to occur homogeneously throughout the cortex, we
expect them to impact both the core and penumbral regions
of the infarct.
The fact that one dose of resveratrol has protective effects
that are apparent 2 weeks later suggests a promising prophylactic avenue. The validity of a preconditioning approach in the
clinic was nicely described by Dirnagl and colleagues30 who
defined clinical scenarios where a preconditioning approach
could have a direct impact. Resveratrol also protects against
stroke when administered post-injury. Although not tested as
a postconditioning paradigm, future studies are needed to test
whether resveratrol could be used in a postconditioning setting. Also future studies can test whether pre- and post-resveratrol treatment in tandem can enhance neuroprotection.
Resveratrol has been used in several clinical trials and
deemed safe for use in humans at doses up to a few grams
per day. Our finding that tachyphylaxis to RPC did not occur
when administered on an everyday basis suggests that multiple administrations are feasible, if required. Additionally, oral
administration of resveratrol as a neuroprotective intervention
in rodents has been validated by several groups and seems
similar to that of intraperitoneal or intravenous administration.31 Taken together, our current findings build on the body
of preclinical evidence for resveratrol as a potential treatment
in the stroke clinic.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Supplemental Methods:
Focal cerebral ischemia by reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)
Right-side MCAo was produced similarly as previously described1. Mice were anesthetized with
3% isoflurane in 100% O2, and maintained at 1 – 1.5% throughout the surgery. Rectal and
temporalis muscle temperatures were constantly monitored and maintained at 37.0 °C using
heating pads (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Cerebral blood flow was monitored
before, during, and after MCAO using a Laser-Doppler (Perimed System, Stockholm, Sweden)
probe over the skull. The right common carotid artery was exposed through a midline neck
incision and dissected free from surrounding nerves and fascia. Next, the occipital artery
branches of the external carotid artery were dissected and coagulated. MCAO was induced by
inserting a silicone-coated 8-0 monofilament nylon surgical suture into the internal carotid artery
and circle of Willis via the proximal ECA. After 60 min of MCAO the intraluminal suture was
carefully removed, the neck incision was closed, and the animal was kept in a humidified
neonatal incubator set at 32 °C for one hour before being returned to its home cage. The surgeon
was blinded to each treatment. Animals that did not display a ≥ 80% reduction in cerebral blood
flow were excluded. Full documentation of inclusion, exclusion, mortality (Table 1) and cerebral
blood flow (Table 2) can be found in the supplemental information.
Neurological scoring
24 hours after MCAO, animals were scored based on a neurobehavioral battery (focal
neurological score: movements such as body symmetry, gait, climbing, circling behavior,
forelimb symmetry, compulsory circling, and whisker response) as previously described1. Focal
score ranged from 0 – 28, where 0 is considered normal and 28 indicates severe neurological
deficits. The investigator scoring neurological deficits was blinded to the experimental
conditions.
Quantification of infarct volume
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with heparinized ice-cold
saline. Animals were then decapitated and the brain was rapidly removed, sliced and stained with
triphenyl tetrazolum chloride (TTC, Sigma)2. Brain slices were fixed in 10% formaldehyde
(Corning) and imaged using a flat-bed image scanner. Images were corrected for auto color
intensity and contrast. Infarct volume was measured using NIH image (Image J) and correct for
edema as previously described3, where infarct volume = (contralateral hemisphere volume –
volume of noninfarcted tissue of the ipsilateral hemisphere) / (volume of contralateral
hemisphere) × 100. Infarct volume was quantified by a blinded researcher.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and subsequent quantitative PCR
Mouse brain cortices were dissected, frozen, pulverized in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in
cross-linking solution containing 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at RT. The reaction was
stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM and placing the samples on ice for
5 min. After two washes in cold PBS, the pellet was incubated in Cell lysis buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mM PMSF and
Mini Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche)) on ice for 10 min. After
centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the nuclei were resuspended in Nuclei lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS supplemented with protease
inhibitors) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Next, chromatin was sonicated to 200-500 bp
fragment size, centrifuged at maximum speed for 20 min and diluted in ChIP dilution buffer
(0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton-X100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 167 mM NaCl,
1 
 

supplemented with protease inhibitors). Input aliquots were saved at this point. The sonicated
chromatin was pre-cleared by incubation with Protein G Magnetic Beads-salmon sperm DNA for
1h rotating at 4°C. The cleared supernatant was set up for chromatin immunoprecipitations with
5 ug of anti-Sirt1 antibody (Millipore) or control IgG overnight at 4°C rotating. The next day,
salmon sperm DNA-blocked beads were added to the immunoprecipitation reactions and
samples were incubated rotating for an additional hour. Beads were washed sequentially for 5
min at 4C on the rotator with 1 ml each of: Low salt wash (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X100, 2 mM
EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH8.0, 150 mM NaCl supplemented with protease inhibitors), High salt
wash (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl),
LiCl wash (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% Na deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.), and TE wash (10 mM Tris- HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Beads were resuspended in 250 µl
of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO3) and incubated at RT for 15 min with frequent
agitation. Eluted samples were re-eluted with another 250 µl of elution buffer. Cross-linking
was reversed by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 0.2M and incubating for 4h at 65°C.
Samples were treated with proteinase K for 1 h at 45°C. The DNA was purified by phenolchloroform extraction and EtOH precipitation.
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed with the following primers:
BDNF Forward 5’ – TGACAGGCTTGGCTTCTGT – 3’
BDNF Reverse 5’ – GGCAGCGAGAGCAGTCCT – 3’
UCP2 Forward 5’ – CGGGGCTAAGGAGGATAAAA – 3’
UCP2 Reverse 5’ – CGAGGACAAACTCAGCAGGT – 3’
qPCR was carried out in triplicate using SYBR Green reagent (Roche) in the LightCycler® 480
II (Roche Applied Science) machine and analyzed with the ΔΔCT method. DNA-relative
enrichment was determined by normalizing to an input genomic DNA and pre-serum IgG as
background control.  
Isolation of synaptosomes via Percoll gradient fractionation 
A Percoll gradient fractionation protocol was used to isolate synaptosomes according to Dunkley
and colleagues4 with slight modifications. Mice were decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia and
their cortices immediately immersed in isolation medium at 4ºC (250 mM sucrose, 1.0
mM ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, and 0.25 mM dithiothreitol at pH 7.4). Tissue was
chopped with scissors, rinsed thoroughly in isolation medium and homogenized in a glass Teflon
homogenizer with 7 up-and-down strokes. The homogenate was diluted to give 10% w/v and
centrifuged at 500 ˟ g for 5 min (Sorvall RC5 centrifuge, Newton CT). The supernatant was
layered on a Percoll (Sigma) gradient (prepared in 12.0 ml polycarbonate tubes consisting of 2.0
ml each of 23, 15, 10 and 3% v/v Percoll). The sample layered gradient was centrifuged at
32,500 ˟ g for 5 min. Synaptosomes were then collected between the 23-15% and 15-10%
Percoll junctions, washed once with isolation medium by centrifugation at 15,000 ˟ g for 10 min
and once with 0.25 M sucrose at the same speed and duration. The final pellet here was
resuspended in RIPA buffer (pH 8.0 consisting of 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, supplemented with 1% protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma), 1% phosphatase inhibitor (PhosphoStop, Roche)) and processed for protein analysis
according to the Western blot protocol below.
Western blotting
Mice were decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia, brains were removed and cortices dissected
in a blinded fashion. This tissue was homogenized in RIPA buffer (see above) and incubated on
ice for 30 minutes. Debris was then pelleted by a 12,000 × g spin for 20 minutes at 4ºC. Protein

concentration was measured by Bradford assay (BioRad) and equal amounts of protein were run
on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad) and the blot was blocked with 5% blotting grade blocker (BioRad)
in TBST (0.1% Tween-20) for 2 hours at room temperature. Probing with primary antibodies
was achieved by overnight incubation at 4ºC: Sirt1 (1:1000, Santa Cruz); UCP2 (1:500,
Calbiochem); VDAC (1:2000, Cell Signaling); β-Actin (1:50,000, Cell Signaling). Next, blots
were incubated with species specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000, GE
healthcare) for 1 hr at room temperature. Protein bands were developed by addition of ECL
reagents (Thermo) and detected using x-ray film (Denville Scientific). Exposed films were
digitalized and blots were analyzed densitometrically using Image J software. Two normalized
values (for the same sample) from different blots were averaged to give the values presented.
BDNF ELISA assay
BDNF concentration was quantified using a ChemiKineTM BDNF Sandwich ELISA Kit
(Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were processed via the
Western blot protocol above. Each sample was first normalized to 5 µg/µl protein then diluted
with sample dilution buffer (kit) to give 2.5 µg/µl and 1.25 µg/µl. These two concentrations were
used in duplicate to calculate BDNF concentration in pg/ml.
