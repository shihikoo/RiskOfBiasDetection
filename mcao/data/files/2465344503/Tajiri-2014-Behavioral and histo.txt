Abstract
Stroke is a major cause of death and disability, with very limited treatment option. Cell-based therapies have emerged as
potential treatments for stroke. Indeed, studies have shown that transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) exerts functional
benefits in stroke models. However, graft survival and integration with the host remain pressing concerns with cell-based
treatments. The current study set out to investigate those very issues using a human NSC line, NSI-566RSC, in a rat model of
ischemic stroke induced by transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Seven days after stroke surgery, those animals
that showed significant motor and neurological impairments were randomly assigned to receive NSI-566RSC intracerebral
transplants at two sites within the striatum at three different doses: group A (0 cells/ml), group B (5,000 cells/ml), group C
(10,000 cells/ml), and group D (20,000 cells/ml). Weekly behavioral tests, starting at seven days and continued up to 8 weeks
after transplantation, revealed dose-dependent recovery from both motor and neurological deficits in transplanted stroke
animals. Eight weeks after cell transplantation, immunohistochemical investigations via hematoxylin and eosin staining
revealed infarct size was similar across all groups. To identify the cell graft, and estimate volume, immunohistochemistry
was performed using two human-specific antibodies: one to detect all human nuclei (HuNu), and another to detect human
neuron-specific enolase (hNSE). Surviving cell grafts were confirmed in 10/10 animals of group B, 9/10 group C, and 9/10 in
group D. hNSE and HuNu staining revealed similar graft volume estimates in transplanted stroke animals. hNSEimmunoreactive fibers were also present within the corpus callosum, coursing in parallel with host tracts, suggesting a
propensity to follow established neuroanatomical features. Despite absence of reduction in infarct volume, NSI-566RSC
transplantation produced behavioral improvements possibly via robust engraftment and neuronal differentiation,
supporting the use of this NSC line for stroke therapy.

yield [14–16]. These concerns may serve as potential limitations
respective to the donor cell origin being considered, necessitating
the need for a particular stem cell source to be more suitable for a
specific disease.
Because stroke is a major cause of death and disability, any
treatment that would help stroke patients recover some of the lost
motor or cognitive function, would substantially improve their
quality of life. Cell-based therapies have emerged as potential
methods to treat several neuropathological diseases and injuries,
including stroke [1–5,9–13]. Laboratory studies and limited
clinical trials have shown that transplantation of neural stem cells
(NSCs) in stroke is safe and effective [17–20]. The mechanism of
action of stem cell therapy for stroke remains not fully understood,

Introduction
Stroke is a major unmet clinical need with only one current
FDA-approved drug, the tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) [1–5].
The efficacy of tPA is limited to 4.5 hours after stroke onset and
benefits only about 3% of ischemic stroke patients [6–8]. The
advent of stem cell therapy opens the possibility of regenerating
the injured brain and may prove effective in stroke beyond the
acute phase of the disease [9–13]. With the increasing diversity of
stem cell sources emerging for donor cells in transplantation
therapy, many laboratory-to-clinic translational factors must first
be considered, dynamics such as the source of the cells, ease of
extraction, immunogenicity, capacity for proliferation, and cell

but the two major postulated reparative pathways involve cell
replacement and secretion of growth factors [1–5,9–13,21,22]. To
date, graft survival and integration with the host remain pressing
concerns with cell-based treatment options. The current study set
out to investigate those very issues using a human NSC line, NSI566RSC, in a rat model of ischemic stroke.
Preclinical evidence has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of
NSI-566RSC in animal models of the motor neuron disease
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [23–26], spinal cord injury
[27], and ischemic paraplegia [28]. Larger animal models have
also been used to assess safety of NSI-566RSC for CNS
transplantation [29,30]. Functional recovery observed in these
animal models has been ascribed to neuronal differentiation
capacity of NSI-566RSC [25,31], which parallels extensive in vitro
characterization of these cells similarly demonstrating the cells’
ability to display neuronal phenotypic features (i.e., functional
motoneurons) [32,33]. The need for immunosuppression in order
to augment graft survival and functional effects has been indicated
in relevant ALS animal models [30,34]. This translational research
portfolio forms the basis for a clinical trial of transplanting NSI566RSC in ALS patients [35].
Our long-standing interest in stem cell therapy for stroke
prompted us to examine the efficacy of NSI-566RSC in an animal
model of cerebral ischemia. We report here that intracerebral
transplantation of NSI-566RSC at subacute phase of stroke

produced behavioral improvements accompanied by graft survival
and neuronal differentiation, extending the application of NSI566RSC for transplantation therapy in ischemic stroke.

Materials and Methods
Subjects
All experiments were conducted in accordance with the
National Institute of Health Guide and Use of Laboratory
Animals, and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the University of South Florida, Morsani
College of Medicine. Rats were housed two per cage in a
temperature- and humidity-controlled room that was maintained
on 12/12 hour-light/dark cycles. They had free access to food and
water. All necessary steps were performed to minimize animal pain
and stress throughout the study.

Stroke and Transplant Surgery
A total of 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats received middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), a well-established stroke model,
as described previously [36–40]. Animals were anesthetized using
isoflurane (1.5%–2.5% with oxygen). The scalp skin was shaved
and scrubbed with alcohol and chlorhexidine surgical scrub. The
animal was fixed in stereotaxic apparatus, then starting slightly
behind the eyes, a midline sagittal incision about 2.5 cm long is

displayed normal motor behavior at Baseline (i.e., prior to stroke). At day 7 post-stroke, all animals exhibited 100% biased swing behaviors, indicating
that all animals received successful stroke. At 14 days post-stroke onwards, dose-dependent and timing-dependent effects of the treatment were
recognized, in that the improvement in behavioral performance was in the order of high dose to zero dose as follows: 20,000 cells/ml (D) .10,000

again with isoflurane and the incision opened. The filament
causing the occlusion was removed and the stump of the external
carotid ligated close to the carotid bifurcation. The skin incision
was closed with staples. Finally, the animal was placed in a cage
over a warming blanket until full recovery from anesthesia. Forty
stroke animals were randomly divided into four Groups A–D
(Table 1). They were tested for behavioral and neurological
deficits on Day 6 post stroke (baseline), and then treated on Day 7
post stroke. Those animals that showed significant motor and
neurological impairments were randomly assigned to receive NSI566RSC intracerebral transplants at two sites within the striatum
at three different doses: group A (0 cells/ml), group B (5,000 cells/
ml), group C (10,000 cells/ml), and group D (20,000 cells/ml). The
animal was fixed to a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments). A
26-gauge Hamilton syringe was then lowered into a small burred
skull opening (transplant coordinates were adjusted to 0.5 mm

made. With the rounded end of a spatula, the skull area was
exposed. Using the bregma as reference point (i.e., prior to stroke
surgery) laser Doppler recordings were obtained from the
following coordinates (AP: +2.0, ML: 62.0) at pre, during, and
post surgery to reveal successful MCAo. The skin on the ventral
neck was shaved from the jaw to the manubrium and scrubbed
with alcohol and chlorhexidine surgical scrub. A skin incision was
made over the right common carotid artery. The external carotid
was isolated and ligated as far distally as possible. An incision using
a pair of microscissor was made in the stump of the external
carotid and a 4-0 nylon filament with a pre-fabricated end was
inserted and passed up into the internal carotid artery until
resistance was felt (approximately 15–17 mm), which effectively
blocked the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The isoflurane was
discontinued and the animal placed in a recovery cage over a
warming blanket. After 60 minutes, the animal was anesthetized

anterior and 2.8 mm lateral to bregma and 5.0 mm below the
dural surface [41]. Within this single needle pass, 3 deposits of the
test articles including 2 into the striatum (5.0 mm and 4.0 mm
below the dural surface) and 1 into the cortex (3.0 mm below the
dural surface) were made. The target area was the medial striatum
and medial cortex which corresponds to the ischemic peri-infarct
(or penumbra) area, based on previously established target sites for
similar stereotaxic implants [42]. Each deposit consisted of 3 ml
volume infused over a period of 3 minutes. All animals received
daily immunosuppression (tacrolimus) 1 mg/kg/day IP. All
animals were monitored weekly post-grafting for behavioral and
neurological outcomes. Animals were euthanized at Day 56 days
post-grafting and transcardially perfused with saline and 4%
paraformaldehyde.

Behavioral Tests
All investigators testing the animals were blinded to the
treatment condition. Animals were subjected to elevated body
swing test (EBST) and neurological exam. EBST involved
handling the animal by its tail and recording the direction of the
swings [36–40]. The test apparatus consisted of a clear Plexiglas
box (40640635.5 cm). The animal was gently picked up at the
base of the tail, and elevated by the tail until the animal’s nose was

at a height of 2 inches (5 cm) above the surface. The direction of
the swing, either left or right, was counted once the animals head
moved sideways approximately 10 degrees from the midline
position of the body. After a single swing, the animal was placed
back in the Plexiglas box and allowed to move freely for 30
seconds prior to retesting. These steps were repeated 20 times for
each animal. Intact rats displayed a 50% swing bias, that was, the
same number of swings to the left and to the right. A 75% swing
bias was used as criterion of successful MCAo. About one hour
after the EBST, neurological exam was conducted as previously
described [36–40] with minor modifications. Neurologic score for
each rat was obtained using 3 tests which included (1) forelimb
retraction, which measures the ability of the animal to replace the
forelimb after it was displaced laterally by 2 to 3 cm, graded from
0 (immediate replacement) to 3 (replacement after several seconds
or no replacement); (2) beam walking ability, graded 0 for a rat
that readily traversed a 2.4-cm-wide, 80-cm-long beam to 3 for a
rat unable to stay on the beam for 10 seconds; and (3) bilateral
forepaw grasp, which measured the ability to hold onto a 2-mmdiameter steel rod, graded 0 for a rat with normal forepaw
grasping behavior to 3 for a rat unable to grasp with the forepaws.
The scores from all 3 tests were averaged to give a mean
neurologic deficit score (maximum possible score, 9 points divided

30–60%, HIGH .60%, while scores for volume were rated as
follows: Low ,1 mm3, Medium 1–2 mm3, High .2 mm3. For
calculation of area of infarction in mm2, a separate cohort of
animals (n = 8 per group) subjected to the same experimental
paradigm were processed for Triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining. Anesthetized animals were perfused intracardially
with saline. The brain tissue was then removed, immersed in cold
saline for 5 minutes, and sliced into 2.0-mm thick sections. The
brain slices were incubated in a 2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(Sigma) dissolved in normal saline for 30 minutes at 37uC and then
transferred into a 5% formaldehyde solution for fixation. The area
of infarction in each slice was measured using a digital scanner and
the Image Tools program (University of Texas Health Sciences
Center in San Antonio). The area of infarction in each animal was
obtained from largest infarcted brain slice.

(prior to stroke), then at 7 days after stroke (prior to transplantation) and at weekly intervals over an eight-week period.

Statistical Analysis
The data were evaluated statistically using either Two-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA), or repeated measure of ANOVA
and subsequent post hoc compromised t-tests for behavior. These
statistical analyses employed a StatView 5.0 software (USA).
Statistical significance was preset at p,0.05.

30% sucrose and later sectioned at 40 mm thickness using a
freezing sliding microtome. Every sixth section through the brain
was selected for staining.

Sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15
minutes, washed 3 times with PBS, and further treated with 0.3%
Triton X-100 for 30 minutes followed by wash. Tissue was then
blocked in normal horse serum for 90 minutes, and incubated with
either mouse anti human nuclei (HuNu; MAB1281; Chemicon
International, Temecula, CA; 1:2000) or chicken anti humanspecific neuron-specific enolase (hNSE; AB-9698; Chemicon
International, Temecula, CA 1:2000) at room temperature
overnight. Sections were washed and again blocked with horse
serum for 90 minutes, then treated with biotinylated donkey antimouse or biotinylated donkey anti-chicken secondary antibody
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; 1:2000) for 90
minutes. Following wash, sections were incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA; 1:5000) for 90 minutes, and then
developed with diaminobenzidine containing nickel chloride for 1
minute. The sections were then mounted on gelatin-coated slides,
dried, labeled, and cover-slipped. In addition, sections adjacent to
sections (1-in-6 series) stained for human stem cells were processed
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). All slides were examined and
scanned using Nikon AZ100 Multizoom microscope (Nikon
Instruments, Inc, Japan) for further qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses.

Behavioral analyses revealed that all animals included in this
study displayed normal behaviors at baseline prior to stroke
surgery. At 7 days post-stroke, all animals exhibited the typical
stroke-induced behavioral deficits characterized by significantly
biased swing activity and impaired neurological performance.
However, at 14 days post-stroke (i.e., 7 days post-transplantation
onwards), significant recovery of motor (Figure 1) and neurological
(Figure 2) functions in stroke animals that received intracerebral
transplantation of high doses of 10,000 cells/ml (C) and 20,000
cells/ml (D) of NSI-566RSC compared to vehicle-infused stroke
animals (A) or those stroke animals that received the low dose of
5,000 cells/ml (B). ANOVA revealed statistically significant
treatment effects (p’s,0.01). Post hoc compromised t-tests also
revealed dose-dependent treatment effects and post-transplantation timing effects (p’s,0.05). There was stable improvement in
those stroke transplanted with high doses of cells (Groups C and D)
which showed a trend of better improvement over time up to the
56-day study period. Although there was slight improvement in
the behavioral performance of vehicle-infused stroke animals and
stroke animals that received the low dose of 5,000 cells/ml, the
recovery of motor and neurological tests demonstrated by high
dose transplanted stroke animals was significantly better throughout the 56-day period compared to vehicle-infused stroke animals
or those stroke animals that received the low dose of 5,000 cells/ml
(p’s,0.05). There were significant dose-dependent differences in
the behavioral improvement across treatment groups at posttransplantation periods with the highest dose of 20,000 cells/ml
showing the most significant improvement in both motor and

Functional Evaluation of NSC Grafts in Stroke

immunosuppressant drugs, albeit with neuoroprotective effects,
display limited therapeutic window of opportunity, in that the
drugs must be administered prior to, during, and/or immediately
after the injury. Beyond this very acute time point, such as the
present two weeks post-stroke period, we and several others have
found that these drugs are not effective. In addition, a vis-à-vis
comparison between non-immunosuppressed transplanted stroke
animals versus immunosuppressed transplanted stroke animals
revealed that immunosuppressed transplanted stroke animals
significantly produced functional recovery compared to immunosuppression treatment alone [46]. Moreover, the choice to deliver
the cocktail of immunosuppressants in the present study was based
on a series of preclinical studies that supported the ongoing clinical
trials of the same cells in ALS patients. This cocktail was proven
effective in facilitating the graft effects in animal models of ALS,
and approved by the FDA for this clinical trial. Accordingly, as we
translate these NSCs for stroke clinical application, in keeping with
the FDA’s requirement and also based on preclinical studies from
our group and several others, we maintain the transplant protocol
with the immunosuppresion regimen. However, if the transplant
procedure was done acutely in stroke, we would be compelled to
conduct another vis-à-vis study comparing NSCs with vehicle
versus NSCs with immunosuppressants. For the present delayed
transplantation regimen, and with the FDA requiring that the
same protocol done in ALS be followed in the stroke arena in
order to gain entry into the clinic, both scientific and clinical bases
support our decision to maintain the NSCs with immunosuppressant regimen.
This study was designed to evaluate the potential therapeutic
value of intracerebral dosing of NSI-566RSC in an animal model
of adult ischemic stroke. The recovery of motor and neurological
tests demonstrated by high dose transplanted stroke animals was
significantly better throughout the 56 day study period compared
to vehicle-infused stroke animals, or low-dosed transplanted
animals. Moreover, there was stable improvement in the high
dose animals, and they showed a trend of better improvement over
time.
These results demonstrated safety and efficacy of NSI-566RSC
in a subacute model of ischemic stroke in rats, indicating a strong
proof-of-principle data that NSI-566RSC are potent cell donors
for transplantation therapy to treat paralysis in stroke patients. A
Phase I trial testing the safety of NSI-566RSC has recently been
completed in the treatment of ALS [35]. Our current observations
of safety and efficacy of NSI-566RSC in stroke animals mimic
similar therapeutic readouts following transplantation of NSI566RSC in animal models of ALS [23–26], spinal cord injury
[27], and ischemic paraplegia [28]. Testing the efficacy of NSI566RSC in larger stroke animals may be needed, although a safety
portfolio already exists in mini-pigs for NSI-566RSC transplantation in CNS [29,30]. That the present transplanted stroke
animals exhibited improvement in motor and neurological
functions accompanied by NSI-566RSC graft survival and
neuronal differentiation also resembled the histopathological
outcomes seen in animal models of ALS, spinal cord injury,
ischemic paraplegia demonstrating engraftment and neuronal
phenotypic persistence in transplanted NSI-566RSC [25,31].
While graft survival and neuronal differentiation have been
confirmed, on-going work is investigating the integration of graft
into host tissue, determining the neuronal phenotypes of the
grafted neurons, and confirming the low proliferation rates of the
grafts as suggested from these preliminary histological studies.
Stroke remains a significant unmet clinical need [1–5] with tPA
efficacy limited to 4.5 hours after stroke onset and benefits only
about 3% of ischemic stroke patients [6–8]. The tPA’s narrow

neurological tests (p’s,0.05). Similarly, there were significant
differences in the behavioral performance among treatment
groups at post-transplantation periods with the most significant
improvement in both motor and neurological tests seen at day 56
post-transplantation (p’s,0.05).

NSI-566RSC Cell Grafts do not Reduce Infarct Size
To confirm infarcts in stroke animals, H&E was used. Infarcts
were confirmed in 93% of the animals; infarct size was similar
across all groups (p = 0.2676) (Figure 3). A summary of infarct
frequency for each treatment group is presented for clarity
(Table 2). Additionally, we rated the size of the infarct in all
animals to get a better approximation of any infarct variability that
might have been affected by the grafts, but did not detect any as
significant number of outliers across the treatment groups (i.e.,
only 1 animal each from Groups A–C). Based on these data,
infarct size was not reduced by NSI-566RSC cell grafts.

NSI-566RSC Cell Grafts Survive and Display Neuronal
Phenotype
To identify the cell graft, and estimate volume, immunohistochemistry was performed using two human-specific antibodies:
one to detect all HuNu (Figures 4 & 5), and another to detect
hNSE (Figure 6). Tabular summaries of the frequency of surviving
grafts and estimated graft size (Table 2 and Table 3) are presented
for clarity. Surviving cell grafts were confirmed in 10/10 animals
of group A, 9/10 group B, and 9/10 in group C. hNSE and HuNu
staining revealed similar graft volume estimates (HuNu volume:
0.5660.15 mm3 and hNSE volume: 0.5860.21 mm3). hNSEimmunoreactive fibers were also present within the corpus
callosum, coursing in parallel with host tracts, suggesting a
propensity to follow established neuroanatomical features. Supplementary files are also provided to show individual animal’s
histology capturing representative images of HuNu and hNSE
(Figures S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, and S9).

Discussion
Here, we demonstrated that intracerebral transplantation of
NSI-566RSC, a spinal cord-derived NSC line, reduced behavioral
deficits associated with ischemic stroke. Significant improvements
in both motor and neurological tests were detected in the NSI566RSC-treated stroke animals. In addition, the results revealed
significant dose-dependent differences in the behavioral improvement across treatment groups at post-transplantation periods with
the highest NSI-566RSC dose showing the most significant
improvement in both motor and neurological tests. Similarly,
there were significant differences in the timing of behavioral
performance among treatment groups at post-transplantation
periods with the most significant improvement in both motor
and neurological tests seen at day 56 post-transplantation,
indicating that the transplanted stroke animals showed improved
recovery over graft maturation period. We observed though that a
few transplanted animals did not contain surviving grafts. The
reason why some transplanted animals do not have detectable
transplanted cells is unknown but it is likely because of graft failure
due to immunosuppressant being ineffective to those particular
animals.
We used a potent immunosuppressive agent (tacrolimus) to
avoid rejection of the human cells, but are aware of the action of
this drug in the brain response to ischemia itself or a possible
synergic effect with the cell-based therapy proposed in our study.
However, in our previous studies, using cyclosporine and
tacrolimus [43–45], we came into the conclusion that these

therapetuc window has prompted the need for novel treatments,
such as stem cell therapy, designed to abrogate stroke beyond the
acute phase of the disease [9–13]. Current clinical trials of cell
therapy for stroke have pursued adult stem cells (.e.g., bone
marrow and placenta) and NSCs, based on ample laboratory
evidence demonstrating safety and efficacy of these cells
[4,5,42,47–49]. Optimization of clinical outcomes has been a
key translational research effort for cell therapy for stroke
[10,13,50–52]. With myriad stem cell sources in transplantation
therapy, many laboratory-to-clinic translational factors have been
recognized including well-defined donor stem cells, cell isolation
and propagation, immunogenicity, capacity for proliferation, and
cell yield [14–16]. Although NSC transplantation has been shown
effective in stroke models [19,53,54], the mechanism of action
remains elusive, in particular graft survival and integration with
the host have yet to be fully understood in the stroke brain. Here,
we provide evidence of a regenerative pathway involving robust
NSI-566RSC engraftment and neuronal differentiation that
accompanied behavioral improvements despite absence of cerebral infarct reduction. Axonal growth with long fibers from NSC
grafts extended to the corpus callosum and traversed with host
tracts, indicating graft-host integration recapitulating endogenous
neuroanatomical landmarks. In addition, while on-going clinical
trials of cell therapy have targeted the acute and chronic phase of
stroke, the present study suggests the sub-acute phase as an equally
effective therapeutic window for NSI-566RSC transplantation in
ischemic stroke.
