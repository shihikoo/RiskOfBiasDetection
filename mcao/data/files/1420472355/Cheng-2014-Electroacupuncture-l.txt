Abstract
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of electroacupuncture-like stimulation at the Baihui (GV20)
and Dazhui (GV14) acupoints (EA at acupoints) during the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and
to establish the neuroprotective mechanisms involved in the modulation of the S100B-mediated signaling pathway.
Methods: The experimental rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 15 min followed by 1 d or
7 d of reperfusion. EA at acupoints was applied 1 d postreperfusion then once daily for 6 consecutive days.
Results: We observed that 15 min of MCAo caused delayed infarct expansion 7 d after reperfusion. EA at acupoints
significantly reduced the cerebral infarct and neurological deficit scores. EA at acupoints also downregulated the expression
of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100B, nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB; p50), and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and
reduced the level of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and apoptosis in the ischemic cortical penumbra 7 d after
reperfusion. Western blot analysis showed that EA at acupoints significantly downregulated the cytosolic expression of
phospho-p38 MAP kinase (p-p38 MAP kinase), tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated death domain (TRADD), Fasassociated death domain (FADD), cleaved caspase-8, and cleaved caspase-3 in the ischemic cortical penumbra 7 d after
reperfusion. EA at acupoints significantly reduced the numbers of GFAP/S100B and S100B/nitrotyrosine double-labeled
cells.
Conclusion: Our study results indicate that EA at acupoints initiated 1 d postreperfusion effectively downregulates
astrocytic S100B expression to provide neuroprotection against delayed infarct expansion by modulating p38 MAP kinasemediated NF-kB expression. These effects subsequently reduce oxidative/nitrative stress and inhibit the TNF-a/TRADD/
FADD/cleaved caspase-8/cleaved caspase-3 apoptotic pathway in the ischemic cortical penumbra 7 d after reperfusion.

by activated astrocytes in the periinfarct area is positively
associated with the severity of delayed infarct expansion and
neurological deficits in models of middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo) [1,4], whereas S100B inhibitors exert potential neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic injuries [5,6]. Thus, the
S100B is an effective biomarker of the severity of infarction and
the extent of brain edema, as shown by previous clinical [7] and
experimental stroke [8] studies. During the subacute phase of
cerebral ischemia, astrocytes release S100B, which interacts with
the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) to
stimulate the microglial secretion of proinflammatory cytokines,
such as interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-

Introduction
During the subacute phase of ischemic brain injury (1–7 d after
the onset of ischemia), astrocytes become activated and accumulate in the periinfarct area, leading to reactive astrogliosis and glial
scar formation, which exacerbate delayed infarct expansion and
play a key pathological role in ischemic injury [1,2]. The S100B
protein, containing two helix-loop-helix calcium-binding structural
motifs, exerts differing effects on neurons depending on its
concentration: neurotrophic effects at nanomolar concentrations
and neurotoxic effects at micromolar concentrations [3]. Increasing evidence has shown that an increase in the synthesis of S100B

a), by activating nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB). The activated
microglia then triggers astrocytic activation by releasing IL-1b
and TNF-a, which promote S100B overexpression [1].
Previous studies have shown that extracellular S100B elicits
complex neuron-glial interactions at high concentrations, and
upregulates inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and
nitric oxide (NO) production in a RAGE-dependent manner in
glial cells to cause NO diffusion and neurotoxicity [1,9,10,11]. The
S100B also induces apoptotic cell death through a NO-dependent
pathway in cultured astrocytes [11] and neurons [12] in vitro. A
study by Yasuda et al. showed that NO can be highly toxic
because of secondary reactions that generate peroxynitrite and
hydroxyl free radicals, which contributed to the expansion of
cerebral infarction in a model of transient MCAo [13].
Chinese physicians have used acupuncture for the treatment of
stroke patients for several centuries [14,15]. A randomized
controlled trial by Sallstrom et al. has shown that acupuncture
can provide significant therapeutic benefits to stroke patients
including by improving daily life activities and motor function
during the subacute stage [16]. According to traditional Chinese
medicine theory, the Baihui (GV20) and Dazhui (GV14) acupoints
are both on the ‘‘Du meridian’’, which directly communicates with
the brain, and are commonly used to treat stroke. Experimental

studies in rats have shown that EA at the Baihui acupoint can
reduce cerebral edema during the acute phase [17] and exert
protective effects against caspase-3-dependent neuronal apoptosis
during the subacute phase [18], of cerebral ischemia. Luo et al.
further reported that EA at the Baihui and Dazhui acupoints
exerts beneficial effects on neural regeneration and synaptic
reconstruction through the modulation of reactive astrocytosis in
the cortical penumbra in the subacute and chronic phases of the
permanent MCAo model [19]. Therefore, the purpose of our
study was to evaluate the effects of EA-like stimulation at the
Baihui and Dazhui acupoints (EA at acupoints) after 15 min of
cerebral ischemia followed by 7 d of reperfusion, and to elucidate
the regulatory mechanisms involved in the S100B-mediated
signaling pathway in the periinfarct area following ischemiareperfusion (I/R) injury.

reperfusion were included in subsequent analyses, whereas rats
with neurological deficit scores ,7 were excluded.

the rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg,
intraperitoneally), then placed in a supine position, and the right
common carotid artery (CCA) and the internal carotid artery
(ICA) were exposed through a neck midline incision, before
ligation of the pterygopalatine artery close to its branch. A 3–0
nylon monofilament suture, blunted at the tip by a flame and
coated with poly-L-lysine (Sigma, USA), was inserted into the right
external carotid artery (ECA) through the CCA into the ICA for
20–25 mm to prevent blood flow into the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). The suture was removed slowly to reestablish the blood
flow 15 min after the MCAo. The rectal temperature of the rats
was maintained at 3760.5uC throughout the surgical procedure
using an electric heating pad.

Experiment A
Grouping
The rats were randomly divided into Sham-1 d, Model-1 d,
Sham-7 d, Model-7 d, EA-7 d, and Non-acup-7 d groups
(n = 5 or 6). The rats in the EA-7 d group were subjected to
15 min of MCAo. After 1 d of reperfusion, the rats received EA at
acupoints once daily for 6 consecutive days. They were sacrificed
7 d after reperfusion. The rats in the Non-acup-7 d group were
subjected to the same procedures as the rats in the EA-7 d group
but received EA at nonacupoints. The rats in the Model-1 d group
were subjected to 15 min of MCAo, and then sacrificed after 1 d
of reperfusion. The rats in the Model-7 d group were subjected to
the same procedures as the rats in the EA-7 d group but did not
receive EA. The rats in the Sham-1 d group were subjected to the
same procedures as the rats in the Model-1 d group but the MCA
origin was not occluded. The rats in the Sham-7 d group were
subjected to the same procedures as the rats in the Model-7 d
group but the MCA origin was not occluded.

Electrode Implantation
After the completion of the MCAo operation, the head of each
rat was fixed to a stereotactic frame and its scalp or costal skin was
incised. The electrode consisted of 0.5-mm stainless steel wires
used for acupoint (or nonacupoint) stimulation. The electrode was
implanted in the Baihui (midpoint of the parietal bone, 4 mm
depth, forward insertion) and Dazhui (below the spinous process of
the seventh cervical vertebra, 5 mm depth, vertical insertion)
acupoints, or in the bilateral costal regions (nonacupoints). The rat
was then returned to its cage.

EA at Acupoints or Nonacupoints
An EA apparatus (Trio 300, ITO Co, Germany) was used to
generate EA at acupoints or nonacupoints for 25 min once daily
for 6 consecutive days. The stimulation parameters were a 5 Hz
amplitude-modulated wave, 2.7–3.0 mA intensity, and a 150-ms
pulse width. The rats were awake and moving freely in their cages
during EA at acupoints or nonacupoints.

Assessment of Neurological Function
The neurological function of each rat was assessed after 1 d and
7 d of reperfusion. The motor, sensory, balance, and reflex
functions were evaluated using the modified neurological severity
score as described previously [21]. The neurological function of
each rat was graded using a numeric scale from 0 to 18 (reference
score, 0; maximal deficit score, 18). Except in the sham-operation
group, the rats with neurological deficit scores $7 after 1 d of

using a brain matrix. The sections were then stained with 2%
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Merck, Germany) for
15 min at 37uC. The brain tissue was differentiated according to
staining: white for infarct areas and red for noninfarct areas. The
cerebral infarct areas of the first 6 sections from the frontal lobe
were measured using image analysis software (ImageJ, Java). The
ratios of infarct areas to the total brain areas were calculated.

after which they were cut into 15-mm sections using a cryostat.
The brain sections were rinsed with a Dulbecco’s phosphate
buffered saline (DPBS; Sigma-Aldrich) containing 0.01% Tween20 and immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/methanol for

stained sections were mounted in a mounting medium (AssistantHistokitt, Germany) and the immunoreactive cells in the ischemic
cortical penumbra were analyzed under a light microscope
(Axioskop 40, Zeiss). The GFAP-, S100B-, NF-kB (p50)-, TNFa-, and iNOS-stained adjacent serial sections from the Model-7 d
group incubated without primary antibodies were used as negative
controls.

Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTPbiotin Nick-end Labeling (TUNEL) Assay
TUNEL staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (QIA33, Calbiochem, USA). Briefly, the brain
sections adjacent to those used in IHC analysis were incubated
with 20 mg/ml proteinase K for 20 min at RT, rinsed with a Trisbuffered saline, and incubated with a 16 terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) equilibration buffer for 30 min at RT. The
sections were then incubated with a TdT labeling reaction mixture
for 1.5 h at 37uC. After the addition of the stop solution and the
blocking buffer, the sections were incubated with a 16 conjugate
solution for 30 min at RT, and the TUNEL-reactive cells were
visualized using a DAB kit (Calbiochem). Finally, the immunoreactive cells in the ischemic cortical penumbra were evaluated
under a light microscope.

IHC Costaining
The brain sections were immersed in 3% H2O2/methanol for
15 min and then incubated with a diluted normal blocking serum
(Vector Laboratories, CA, USA) for 25 min at RT. The sections
were then incubated with a mouse anti-GFAP (1:200 dilution,

Western Blot Analysis
Seven days after reperfusion, the rats were anesthetized with
choral hydrate. The rat brains were removed and coronally
sectioned from 24.3 to +1.7 mm bregma. The right ischemic
cortex was separated into its penumbra and ischemic core
fractions, and the right penumbral cortex was weighed and
homogenized in the cytosolic extraction buffer (#K256-100
BioVision, USA). The lysate was centrifuged at 7006g for
10 min at 4uC, and the supernatant was transferred to a new
tube and centrifuged at 10,0006g for 30 min at 4uC. The resulting
supernatant was collected and retained as the cytosolic fraction,
whereas the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of the mitochondrial
extraction buffer (#K256-100 BioVision, USA) and retained as
the mitochondrial fraction. The protein concentrations of the
cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were quantified using a BioRad assay. The samples were boiled at 100uC in a sodium dodecyl

showed an increasing tendency from 1 d (14.362.8%; Model-1 d
group) to 7 d (25.561.5%; Model-7 d group) after reperfusion
(Figures 2A and 2B). Seven days after reperfusion, the percentage

group than in the Sham-7 d group (P,0.05), and significantly
lower in the EA-7 d group than in the Model-7 d group (P,0.05;
Figures 1 and 2B). The percentage cerebral infarct areas in the
Model-7 d and Non-acup-7 d groups showed non-significant

Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean 6 standard deviation (SD). All
variables showed approximately normal distribution and the
parametric tests, such as analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
independent sample t-test, were appropriate. The data from all
experimental groups were compared using one-way ANOVA
followed by post-hoc analysis using the Scheffe test. The
percentage cerebral infarct areas and neurological deficit scores
within the Sham-1 d and Model-1 d groups were compared using
independent sample t-test. A P value ,0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Effects of EA at Acupoints on Neurological Status
The rats developed moderate neurological deficits after 15 min
of MCAo followed by 1 d of reperfusion (7.361.0, Model-1 d
group; Figure 2C). After 1 d of reperfusion, the neurological deficit
scores of the Model-7 d, EA-7 d, and Non-acup-7 d groups
showed non-significant differences (P.0.05; Figure 2D). After 7 d
of reperfusion, the neurological deficit scores were significantly
higher in the Model-7 d group than in the Sham-7 d group (P,
0.05), and significantly lower in the EA-7 d group than in the
Model-7 d group (P,0.05; Figure 2D). Seven days after reperfusion, the neurological deficit scores of the Model-7 d and Nonacup-7 d groups showed non-significant differences (P.0.05;

in the nuclei and intense nuclear NF-kB (p50) immunoreactivity
was predominantly expressed in the ischemic cortical penumbra.
However, 7 d after reperfusion, nuclear NF-kB (p50) immunostaining was considerably less intense in the EA-7 d group than in
the Model-7 d group (Figures 5A and 5C).

Effects of EA at Acupoints on the Expression of GFAP,

We evaluated all GFAP-, S100B-, NF-kB (p50)-, TNF-a-, and
iNOS-immunoreactive cells within the dotted line-square in the
ischemic cortical penumbra of the brain coronal sections (counts/
mm2; Figure 3A). After 7 d of reperfusion, the numbers of GFAP-,
S100B-, NF-kB (p50)-, TNF-a-, and iNOS-immunoreactive cells
were significantly higher in the Model-7 d group than in the
Sham-7 d group (all P,0.05), and significantly lower in the EA7 d group than in the Model-7 d group (all P,0.05; Figures 3B,

indicated the colocalization of S100 and RAGE, and a marked
increase in S100/RAGE immunoreactivity in the ischemic cortical

injury 7 d after reperfusion in a model of mild focal cerebral
ischemia.
Previous studies have used rat models of permanent [6,26] and
transient [27] focal cerebral ischemia to show that the occurrence
of delayed infarct expansion is closely related to the activation of
astrocytes, which release S100B in the periinfarct area from 1 d
after ischemia, with peak release 3–7 d after ischemia. Other
studies have shown that the inhibition of astrocytic S100B
overexpression in the penumbra can prevent delayed infarct
expansion and attenuate neurological deficit during the subacute
phase of cerebral I/R injury [5,28]. In our study, we observed that
the GFAP (a marker for activated astrocytes) and S100B proteins
were predominantly expressed in the ischemic cortical penumbra.
Double IHC staining indicated the colocalization of S100B and
GFAP immunoreactivity in astrocytes; however, EA at acupoints
significantly downregulated the expression of the GFAP (evaluated
by both IHC and western blot analysis) and S100B proteins in the
ischemic cortical penumbra 7 d after reperfusion. Therefore, we
propose that EA at acupoints exerts its neuroprotective effects
against delayed infarct expansion and neurological deficits, at least
partly, through the downregulation of S100B expression in the
periinfarct area during the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia.
Accumulating evidence has shown that the interaction of a
micromolar concentration of S100B and RAGE elicits neurotoxic
effects through reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the overproduction of NO [1,9]. The activation of RAGE by its ligand S100B
results in the phosphorylation of the MAPK family members,
including ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase, and the activation
of the NF-kB pathway, which induces the transcription of iNOS
and the proinflammatory cytokines in cell culture models in vitro
[29,30] and in a rodent model of focal cerebral ischemia in vivo
[31]. It is well-known that NF-kB, which consists of p50 (50 kDa)
and p65/RelA (60 kDa) subunits, can be activated by cerebral
ischemic insults to dissociate from the inhibitor protein kB (I-kB),
thereby allowing free NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and
initiate the transcription of the proinflammatory genes. Intense
nuclear NF-kB p50 or p65 IHC staining provides further evidence
of the activation of NF-kB during cerebral ischemia [32]. The
S100B/RAGE-induced upregulation of NO and TNF-a synthesis
in neurons and glial cells causes oxidative stress and neuronal
apoptosis, leading to cerebral infarct expansion, which plays a
pivotal pathological role during the subacute phase of cerebral
ischemia [6,33,34]. In our study, double IF staining showed that
the RAGE and S100 proteins (including S100B) colocalized in the
ischemic cortical penumbra. Intense nuclear NF-kB (p50) immunostaining indicated the activation of NF-kB. Further IHC
analysis confirmed the upregulation of the nuclear expression of
NF-kB (p50), and expression of iNOS, and TNF-a, in the ischemic
cortical penumbra, and indicated that EA at acupoints effectively
downregulated nuclear NF-kB (p50) expression, and consequently
iNOS and TNF-a expression, 7 d after reperfusion. Western blot
analysis showed that the expression of p-p38 MAP kinase was
significantly upregulated in the ischemic cortical penumbra after
MCAo, and that EA at acupoints significantly downregulated pp38 MAP kinase expression, but did not affect p-JNK and pERK1/2 expression, in the periinfarct area of the cortex 7 d after
reperfusion. The studies by Collino et al. [35,36] showed that the
MAPK signaling cascade is closely associated with the activation of
NF-kB, and that the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 MAK
kinase contributes to NF-kB activation and the subsequent
upregulation of iNOS and TNF-a expression in the hippocampus
1 d after reperfusion. However, the S100B-mediated inflammatory inhibitors exert neuroprotective effects against cerebral I/R
injury by reducing oxidative stress and suppressing the inflamma-

Effects of EA at Acupoints on the Expression of TUNELimmunoreactive Cells
We observed that the number of TUNEL-immunoreactive cells
in the ischemic cortical penumbra was significantly higher in the
Model-7 d group than in the Sham-7 d group (P,0.05). The
number of TUNEL-immunoreactive cells in the ischemic cortical
penumbra was significantly lower in the EA-7 d group than in the
Model-7 d group (P,0.05; Figure 6C and Table 1). The numbers
of TUNEL-immunoreactive cells in the Model-7 d and Non-acup7 d groups showed non-significant differences (P.0.05; Figure 6C
and Table 1).

Effects of EA at Acupoints on the Expression of GFAP, pJNK, p-ERK, p-p38 MAP Kinase, Cytochrome c, TRADD,
FADD, Cleaved Caspase-8, and Cleaved Caspase-3
Western blot analysis of the ischemic cortical penumbra showed
that the cytosolic expression of GFAP and p-p38 MAP kinase was
significantly higher (5.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively) in the Model7 d group than in the Sham-7 d group (P,0.05), and significantly
lower (0.2- and 0.5-fold, respectively) in the EA-7 d group than in
the Model-7 d group (P,0.05; Figures 7A, 7B, and 7E). The
cytosolic expression of GFAP and p-p38 MAP kinase in the
Model-7 d and Non-acup-7 d groups showed non-significant
differences (P.0.05). In addition, the cytosolic expression of pJNK and p-ERK in the Sham-7 d, Model-7d, EA-7d, and Nonacup-7 d groups showed non-significant differences (both P.0.05;
Figures 7A, 7C, and 7D). The mitochondrial (P.0.05) and
cytosolic (P.0.05) expression of cytochrome c in the ischemic
cortical penumbra showed non-significant differences among the
Sham-7 d, Model-7 d, EA-7 d, and Non-acup-7 d groups
(Figures 8A, 8B, 8C, and 8D). The cytosolic expression of
TRADD, FADD, cleaved caspase-8, and cleaved caspase-3 in the
ischemic cortical penumbra were significantly higher (2.3-, 2.4-,
2.0-, and 2.0-fold, respectively) in the Model-7 d group than in the
Sham-7 d group (all P,0.05), whereas the cytosolic expression of
TRADD, FADD, cleaved caspase-8, and cleaved caspase-3 were
significantly lower (all 0.5-fold) in the EA-7 d group than in the
Model-7 d group (all P,0.05; Figures 8C, 8E, 8F, 8G, and 8H).
However, the cytosolic expression of TRADD, FADD, cleaved
caspase-8, and cleaved caspase-3 in the Model-7 d and Non-acup7 d groups showed non-significant differences (all P.0.05;
Figures 8C, 8E, 8F, 8G, and 8H).

Discussion
In this study, we observed that 15 min of MCAo consistently
caused gross infarction 1 d after reperfusion, and then aggravated
delayed infarct expansion in the entire MCA territory, including
the cortex and striatum, 7 d after reperfusion. Our findings are in
agreement with those of previous studies that used a model of mild
transient focal cerebral ischemia to show the initiation of delayed
infarction 1 d after reperfusion [22,23]. Our results indicated that
EA at acupoints, applied 1 d after cerebral I/R injury and once
daily for 6 consecutive days, significantly reduced the cerebral
infarct areas and attenuated the neurological deficits, whereas EA
at nonacupoints did not attenuate cerebral ischemic injury and
neurological behavioral deficits 7 d after reperfusion. Previous
studies have shown that repeated or single EA preconditioning at
the Baihui acupoint in rats can elicit ischemic tolerance against
cerebral I/R injury [24,25]. Our findings further indicated that a
24-h therapeutic time window for 6 repeated EA-like stimulations
at the Baihui and Dazhui acupoints, but not at nonacupoints,
provided effective neuroprotection against subacute ischemic brain

tory response after transient cerebral ischemia [35,36]. Considering our and previous findings, we suggest that S100B/RAGE
upregulates iNOS and TNF-a expression through p38 MAP
kinase-induced NF-kB activation in the ischemic cortical penumbra during the subacute phase of mild cerebral ischemia. Our
results further indicate that EA at acupoints prevents delayed
infarct expansion by downregulating the S100B-mediated amplification of the inflammatory response in the periinfarct area of the
cortex, and that the effects of EA at acupoints on NF-kB-mediated
iNOS and TNF-a expression can be attributed to the inhibition of
p38 MAP kinase activity in the ischemic cortical penumbra 7 d
after reperfusion.
Increasing evidence has suggested that the neurotoxic effects of
iNOS-derived NO can be attributed to its combination with the
superoxide anion, leading to the formation of peroxynitrite, a
strong oxidative/nitrative molecule that aggravates cerebral I/R
injury [37,38]. Peroxynitrite nitrates tyrosyl residues in proteins to
form nitrotyrosine protein adducts, which are biomarkers of
peroxynitrite action and exert detrimental effects through the
inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation and impairment of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain [39]. Previous studies have shown
that nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity increases 24 h after a neonatal
focal cerebral ischemic insult, and then gradually reduces in the
ischemic cortex 3–7 d after the insult [40,41]. Nitrotyrosine also
induces the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition
pore to promote cytochrome c release and then trigger caspase-3mediated apoptosis during cerebral ischemia [40,41]. Our results
from double IHC staining showed a marked increase in the
colocalization of S100B and nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in the
ischemic cortical penumbra after MCAo, and that EA at acupoints
effectively downregulated S100B/nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity
7 d after reperfusion. Our TUNEL assay results showed that the
apoptotic cells were predominantly located in the periinfarct area
of the cortex, and that EA at acupoints significantly reduced the
numbers of apoptotic cells in the ischemic rim 7 d after
reperfusion. Upon further analysis, we observed correlation
between the patterns of S100B/nitrotyrosine-immunoreactive
and TUNEL-immunoreactive cells in the ischemic cortical
penumbra. On the basis of these results we reasonably deduce
that the neuroprotective effects of EA at acupoints, resulting from
S100B/p38 MAP kinase/NF-kB-mediated iNOS and TNF-a
modulation, can be attributed to the attenuation of oxidative/
nitrative stress and apoptosis in the ischemic cortical penumbra
7 d after reperfusion.
It is well-known that apoptotic neuronal death exacerbates
cerebral infarct in the delayed phase of cerebral I/R injury.
Previous studies have characterized 2 major caspase-dependent
apoptotic pathways: the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which
involves the cytochrome c-initiated caspase cascade, and the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway, which is activated by the death
receptors and caspase-8 [42]. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway is
triggered by the binding of an extracellular death ligand, such as
the Fas ligand (FasL) or TNF-a, to a cell surface death receptor. In
a pathogenic process of cerebral I/R injury, excess TNF-a binds to

the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1) to elicit the
recruitment of TRADD and FADD. These activities induce
caspase-8 activation, which triggers the cleavage of caspase-3,
leading to apoptosis [43]. In addition, TNF-a induces the rapid
activation of NF-kB, which initiates the transcription of the
proinflammatory genes, including iNOS and TNF-a, and
amplifies TNF-a-mediated apoptosis to increase brain damage
during the subacute phase of transient focal cerebral ischemia
[43,44]. According to our western blot analyses, the expression of
cytosolic TRADD, FADD, cleaved caspase-8, and cleaved
caspase-3 were significantly upregulated in the ischemic cortical
penumbra after MCAo. These apoptosis-related proteins, which
function in the TNF-a/death receptor signaling pathway, were
effectively downregulated by EA at acupoints 7 d after reperfusion. However, EA at acupoints did not affect the mitochondrial or
cytosolic expression of cytochrome c in the periinfarct area of the
cortex. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that EA at acupoints
exerts neuroprotective effects against S100B-mediated apoptosis
through the inhibition of the TNF-a/TRADD/FADD/cleaved
caspase-8/cleaved caspase-3 signaling pathway in the ischemic
cortical penumbra 7 d after reperfusion. The effects of EA at
acupoint on TNF-a modulation could further reduce oxidative/
nitrative stress and NF-kB-mediated inflammation during the later
stages of cerebral I/R injury. The antiapoptotic effects of EA at
acupoints did not involve the modulation of the cytochrome cmediated activation of caspase during the subacute phase of
cerebral ischemia. One possible explanation for these observations
is that in the presence of cerebral I/R injury, oxidative stressinduced apoptosis (the cytochrome c-related apoptotic pathway)
occurs during the early phase of reperfusion, whereas inflammatory-mediated injury can continue to the later phase of reperfusion
[35]. However, further research is required to confirm this
hypothesis.
In summary, EA at acupoints initiated 1 d postreperfusion
effectively downregulates astrocytic S100B expression to provide
neuroprotection against delayed infarct expansion through the
modulation of p38 MAP kinase-mediated NF-kB expression. The
effects of EA at acupoints on NF-kB-induced iNOS and TNF-a
regulation contribute to the attenuation of oxidative/nitrative
stress and the downregulation of the TNF-a/TRADD/FADD/
cleaved caspase-8/cleaved caspase-3 apoptotic pathway in the
ischemic cortical penumbra 7 d after reperfusion. Our results
indicate that EA at acupoints could potentially provide a
therapeutic strategy during the subacute phase of I/R injury in
mild transient cerebral ischemia. Further prospective investigations to evaluate the potential clinical application of EA at
acupoints are warranted.
