Abstract The mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU)
transports Ca2? from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial
matrix and thus maintains Ca2? homeostasis. Previous
studies have reported that inhibition of MCU by ruthenium
red (RR) protects the brain from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
injury and that mitochondrial fission plays an important
role in I/R injury. However, it is still not known whether
MCU affects mitochondrial fission. In the present study,
treatment with RR was found to decrease the concentration
of free calcium in the mitochondria, calcineurin enzyme
activity and dynamin-related protein 1 expression, and
treatment with spermine was found to have the opposite
effect in organisms subjected to occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery lasting 2 h followed by 24 h reperfusion.
These results indicate that MCU may be related to mitochondrial fission via modulating mitochondrial Ca2?
uptake and this relationship between MCU and mitochondrial fission may protect the brain from I/R injury.

main treatment restoring blood flow may cause new ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (Jennings et al. 1960). The
mitochondria may play a fundamental role in the regulation
of programmed cell death, by which apoptotic proteins such
as cytochrome C (CytC), endonuclease G, and apoptosis
inducing factor (AIF) are sequestered (Danial and Korsmeyer 2004; Wang 2001). The mitochondria are dynamic
organelles that cleave and fuse consecutively to form new
individual units and interconnected networks within the cell
(Bereiter-Hahn 1990). A balance between mitochondrial
fission and fusion is important to mitochondrial function and
form (Chen and Chan 2004). Previous studies have shown
that inhibition of mitochondrial fission protects the pallium
from nerve injury during cerebral I/R, and that the amount of
mitochondrial fission can increase during apoptosis (Zhang
2013; Youle and Karbowski 2005). Mitochondrial Ca2?
signaling has been shown to regulate mitochondrial fission
through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) (Cereghetti et al. 2008; Cribbs
and Strack 2007). Inhibiting mitochondrial uptake of Ca2?
may decrease mitochondrial fission (Saotome et al. 2008).
Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) transports Ca2?
from the cytoplasm to mitochondrial matrix (Vay et al.
2007). This is the main channel by which mitochondrial free
calcium is regulated (Kirichok and Krapivinsky 2004;
Pradhan et al. 2010). Other recent studies have shown that
inhibition of MCU protects the brain from I/R injury by
decreasing the size of the infarct size, free radical production, and mitochondrial tumefaction (Yu et al. 2012; Zhao
et al. 2013). The process of mitochondrial fission involves
fission proteins, such as Drp1 and hFis1 (Chen and Chan
2004). Drp1 is the main protein regulator of mitochondrial
fission. It also acts as an intrinsic factor in several mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathways (Frank et al. 2001).
Drp1 can be modified by viable calcineurin (Cereghetti et al.

2008; Cribbs and Strack 2007). This accelerates mitochondrial fission. The enzyme activity of calcineurin (CN) is
affected by the concentration of free calcium (Li et al. 2012).
Increasing the concentration of Ca2? in the cytoplasm and
mitochondrial matrix is the critical factor to mitochondrial
fission (Saotome et al. 2008). However, it is not clear
whether MCU affects mitochondrial fission. In the present
study, ruthenium red (RR), inhibitor of MCU, decreased the
severity of the mitochondrial injury via the prevention of
intracellular Ca2? overload. RR treatment decreased the
level of Drp1 expression through inhibition of MCU and
affected mitochondrial fission. These results indicate that
MCU may be related to mitochondrial fission by causing
changes in mitochondrial Ca2? content. This relationship
between MCU and mitochondrial fission may provide protection against I/R injury.

Materials and methods
Subjects
All procedures concerning animals were under protocols
approved by the institution of animal care and use committee at the Ethics Committee of Qingdao University
Medical College (No. QUMC 2011-09). One hundred and
three male adult Wistar rats, weighing 220–280 g, were
supplied by the Experiment Animal Center of Qingdao
Drug Inspection Institute (SCXK (LU) 20090007). Of
these, 23 rats were withdrawn from the study: two died
from anesthesia; nine died during the operation on the
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); 12 died during
the period of reperfusion. The other 80 Wistar rats were
randomly divided into four groups: (1) a sham group
(n = 20). (2) Rats in the I/R?RR group (n = 20) were
given an intravenous bolus of ruthenium red (2.5 mg/kg)
15 min before MCAO; (3) the rats in the I/R?Sper group
(n = 20) were given an intravenous bolus of spermine
(5 mg/kg) 15 min prior to MCAO. (4) The rats in the I/R
group (n = 20) were subjected to MCAO surgery but given
no drugs. All of the Wistar rats were housed in groups of 5
in the environment with room temperature of 20–25 °C and
permitted food and water ad libitum before surgery.
Surgeries
Rats were kept in a fasting state for 12 h before surgery and
then anesthetized with 10 % (v/v) chloral hydrate at a dose
of 350 mg/kg (i.p.). The remaining MCAO rats were
generated as referred to the previous study (Yang et al.
2008). In brief, a middle incision was made in the neck and
then the left common carotid artery, internal carotid artery
and external carotid artery were exposed. The external

123

carotid artery and distal end of common carotid artery were
ligated with 3–0 sutures. A small incision was made in the
proximal part of the common carotid artery and then the
internal carotid artery was clipped with an artery clip.
Through the small incision on the common carotid artery, a
nylon filament (diameter of 0.286 mm) was introduced into
the internal carotid artery and advanced into the middle
cerebral artery until slight resistance was met (18–20 mm
from the bifurcation of external and internal carotid artery).
After 2 h of ischemia, the nylon filament was carefully
removed to restore the blood flow. The rats’ body temperature was maintained at 36.5–37.5 °C using a heating
pad.
Neurological deficit scoring and evaluation
After 2 h of MCAO, neurological deficits were evaluated by
one experimenter who was blind to the experimental group.
This experimenter used a scale system that has been
described previously (Longa et al. 1989). Rats that showed
no neurological deficits after reperfusion and rats that showed
neurological deficits but also had subarachnoid hemorrhages
at the base of the skull were excluded from the study.
Tissue preparation
The rats were anesthetized as described above and killed by
decapitation. The ischemia cerebral cortex was rapidly
removed. All the procedures were performed on ice. For
transmission electron microscopic observation, the
removed tissue was preserved in 2.5 % (v/v) solution of
glutaraldehyde. The cerebral cortexes were stored at
-80 °C until use in Western blot analysis. For ELISA and
mitochondrial calcium analysis, the tissue was used
immediately after removal from the rat.
Measurements of mitochondrial calcium content
Isolation of mitochondria
Cerebral cortical mitochondria were isolated by differential
centrifugation, using a Functional Mitochondria Isolation
Kit (Genmed Scientifics, Inc., Wilmington, DE, US). The
freshly removed cerebral cortex tissue was weighed and
rapidly placed in ice-cold washing liquid (provided with
the kit, Reagent A) to dislodge impurities. It was then
crumbled and homogenized in Glass/Teflon Potter
homogenizer with isolating fluid (prepped prior using the
provided physic liquor in the kit, Reagent F: Reagent C:
Reagent B = 1:50:200), then the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500g for 10 min and the supernatant was
retained (the caryon and unsolvable cell were removed).
The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000g for 10 min and

isolated). The isolated mitochondria were conserved in
preservative fluid (Reagent E in the kit) and either stored at
-80 °C or used immediately.

Spectra, France). The images are shown in black and white.
The lighter the band, the higher the protein concentration.
And the GAPDH served as the internal standard.

Determination of mitochondrial calcium

Transmission electron microscopy

The mitochondrial calcium was chelated by Fluo-3, AM
(AAT BioquestÒ, Inc. US). The isolated mitochondria were
washed three times in Hanks’ solution and then Fluo-3,
AM (5 lM) was added in. The samples with Fluo-3, AM
were incubated in 37 °C for 30 min. Then, the samples
were washed with Hanks’ solution three times to dislodge
the excess Fluo-3, AM and incubated in 37 °C for 30 min
again. The fluorescence intensity was determined at the
excitation 506 nm and emission 526 nm using a fluorescence microplate reader.

The ultrastructure of the mitochondria in the tissue was
observed using a JEM-1200EX transmission electron
microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The sample, which had
been prepared earlier, was fixed in a 1 % (w/v) solution of
osmium tetroxide and then the fixed tissue was embedded
in Epon812-Araldite. Ultrathin slices (50 nm thick) were
cut for observation.

Measurements of CN enzymatic activities
CN enzymatic activities were determined using a CN
detection kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute,
Nanjing, China) after the luciferin–luciferase method. In
brief, the cerebral cortex tissue was homogenized in
homogenizer with isotonic Na chloride to make 10 % (w/v)
homogenate, followed by centrifugation at 3,500 rmp for
5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was retained for the
enzymatic activities and detection of protein content. The
next steps in the process were performed in accordance
with the instructions induced in the detection kit. Protein
content was determined using the BCA method. Computation rule for CN was given in the direction.

Statistical analysis
SPSS18.0 statistical software was used for analysis and the
experimental data are here expressed as mean ± SD.
ANOVA was used to evaluate the differences between
groups and P \ 0.05 was considered to be a statistically
significant difference.

The ischemic cerebral cortex tissue was crumbled and
homogenized in a Glass/Teflon Potter homogenizer with
lysis buffer (RIPA:PMSF = 500:1). Proteins were
abstracted from the cerebral cortex tissue and then the
protein concentrations were assayed. Each sample
(30–60 lg) was loaded on a 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) apparatus
and run for about 90 min. Then, the proteins were electrotransferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were
blocked with mouse monoclonal anti-Drp1 antibody (1:600
dilution, Abcam, HK diluted with 5 % defatted milk
powder dissolved in PBST) or mouse monoclonal antiGAPDH antibody (1:6000 dilution, Zhongshan Golden
Bridge Biotechnology, China) for 2 h or overnight in 4 °C.
The membranes were washed three times with PBST and
then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in
blocking solution for 1 h. They were developed using the

scores of both I/R?Sper (Sper: spermine, excitant of

Concentration of free calcium in the mitochondria
A previous study has shown that the tight control of MCU
activity is probably crucial for the normal physiology and
to the integrity of the mitochondria (Sripetchwandee et al.
2013). Misregulation of MCU activity may lead to
derangement of intracellular Ca2? signaling and mitochondrial dysfunction. To determine whether the mitochondrial free calcium concentration is affected by RR, the
mitochondria of cerebral tissue were isolated by differential centrifugation using a Functional Mitochondria Isolation Kit. The mitochondrial free calcium concentration of
both I/R?Sper and the I/R group was significantly higher

However, the mitochondria had been altered and the mitochondrial

given above, the mitochondrial free calcium concentration
of the I/R?RR group was significantly lower than that of
the I/R group (Fig. 2), suggesting that MCU was one cause
of Ca2? accumulation and that inhibition of MCU activity
may prevent mitochondrial calcium overload and thus
reduce the severity of ischemic brain damage.

regulates the translocation of Drp1 to mitochondria (Cribbs
and Strack 2007). Increased expression of Drp1 protein in
ischemic cerebral tissue was analyzed by Western blot after
24 h reperfusion. The protein samples were loaded at
50–60 lg. GAPDH served as the loading control. As
shown in Fig. 4, the level of Drp1 expression in the
I/R?Sper and I/R groups was significantly higher than in
the sham group, but the level of Drp1 expression was
significantly lower in the I/R?RR group than in the I/R
group. These results suggest that the treatment with RR
decreased the expression of Drp1.

Calcineurin activity
CN activity is coupled to the concentration of free calcium
(Li et al. 2012). To determine the relationship between CN
and calcium levels, the level of CN activity was determined
by ELISA using the CN detection kit. It was here found
that the CN activity in the I/R?Sper and I/R groups was
significantly higher than that in sham group, and the CN
activity of I/R?RR group was lower than that in I/R group
(Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that the concentration
of calcium dynamically regulate CN activity.
Expression of Drp1 in the cerebral tissue
Calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of Drp1 primarily controls its association with the mitochondria and so

Mitochondrial ultrastructure
To confirm these results, changes in mitochondrial morphology were assessed under each set of conditions using a
JEM-1200EX transmission electron microscope. As shown
in Fig. 5, the mitochondria of the sham group were intact
and the mitochondrial cristae of the sham group were clear,
but the mitochondrial ultrastructures in the I/R?Sper and
I/R groups had been altered and the mitochondrial cristae
of the I/R?Sper and I/R groups were ambiguous. As
expected, the mitochondrial ultrastructures were less dramatically altered and the mitochondrial cristae were clearer

Fig. 6 Ischemic diagram of mitochondrial fission mechanism on
MCAO of rats. The sodium calcium exchanger (NCX) appears to
operate in two ways, a forward mode and reverse mode. The first
system transports Na? into the cell and Ca2? out of the cell, and the
latter does the opposite. In I/R injury, the reverse mode of NCX is
active. This causes intracellular calcium overload and cellular injury.
MCU appears in the active state and transports Ca2? from the
cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix when the concentration of

intracellular calcium increases. Alterations in mitochondrial morphology and function take place when excessive calcium gets into the
mitochondrial matrix. Drp1 aggregates on the outer mitochondrial
membrane, and mediating mitochondrial fission. Mitochondrial
swelling and injury took place, resulting in the release of calcium.
This leads to intracellular calcium overload and causes a positive
feedback loop

in the I/R?RR group than in the I/R?Sper and I/R groups
(Fig. 5). These results indicate that the blockage of MCU is
involved in the mitochondrial injury by preventing Ca2?
overload.

role of MCU in the regulation of the brain I/R injury is here
proposed (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results indicate
that MCU may play a critical role in mitochondrial fission
in cerebral I/R injury and that this role may involve altering
the concentration of Ca2? in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial matrix.
Previous studies have reported that mitochondria are
dynamic organelles and that alteration of mitochondrial
morphology may change the susceptibility of the cell to
apoptosis incurred during I/R (Bereiter-Hahn 1990; Dimmer and Scorrano 2006; Fliss and Gattinger 1996).
Imbalance of the mitochondrial fusion and fission dramatically changes mitochondrial morphology (BossyWetzel et al. 2003). This may result in the breakdown of
the mitochondrial network and respiratory deficit in cells
(Youle and Karbowski 2005; Bossy-Wetzel et al. 2003).
Drp1, the main agent modulating mitochondrial fission, is
mainly located in the cytolymph, but the moiety distributed

Discussion
In the present study, Ruthenium red, an inhibitor of MCU,
reduced the severity of mitochondrial injury via the prevention of intracellular Ca2? overload, decreased the level
of Drp1 expression, and regulated CN activity through
modulation of MCU. These results indicate that MCU may
be related to mitochondrial fission and that this relationship
may take place through modulation of mitochondrial Ca2?
uptake. This relationship between MCU and mitochondrial
fission may protect the brain from ischemia/reperfusion
injury. Based on the findings reported here, a model of the

123

Role of mitochondrial calcium uniporter

on the mitochondria appearing spotted states, and the
subunits of the spotted states are potential locus for mitochondrial fission (Smirnova et al. 2001). Overexpression of
Drp1 accelerates mitochondrial fission and produces significant amounts of mitochondrial fragmentation. Reducing
the expression of Drp1 inhibits mitochondrial fission and
strengthens the mitochondrial network within the cell
(Smirnova et al. 2001). As in previous studies, the present
results showed expression of Drp1 to decrease with RR
treatment in brains subjected to 2 h of ischemia and 24 h of
reperfusion. This indicates that inhibition of MCU by RR
may protect the brain from I/R injury by decreasing
mitochondrial fission.
Previous studies have shown that mitochondrial Ca2?
signaling is intimately related to mitochondrial fission
(Toido et al. 2012). Posttranslational modifications,
including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, are probably
involved in the regulation of mitochondrial fission (Cerveny et al. 2007). After entering the cell, mitochondrial
calcium causes mitochondrial motion to cease and induces
mitochondrial fission (Saotome et al. 2008). Cytoplasmic
Ca2? has been deemed important to mitochondrial motility,
which is inversely correlated with the speed of mitochondrial movement (Lemasters et al. 1999). Ca2? activates
calcineurin after entering the cell and then causes
dephosphorylation of Drp1 in the serine 637 or 656 state
(Cereghetti et al. 2008; Cribbs and Strack 2007). Increasing
amounts of evidence indicate that calcineurin hyperactivity
occurred during cell death by intrinsic stimuli (Rivera and
Maxwell 2005). It has been reported that inhibiting the
process of dephosphorylation of Drp1 using the phosphatase calcineurin could decrease the amount of mitochondrial fragmentation that takes place during cell death
(Cereghetti et al. 2010). The mitochondria are some of the
most important organs for storing calcium. They can regulate the cell’s calcium homeostasis by taking up or
releasing calcium. MCU, located in mitochondrial inner
membrane, is one of the main mechanisms by which
mitochondria can take up Ca2? (Vay et al. 2007; Kirichok
and Krapivinsky 2004; Pradhan et al. 2010). Mitochondrial
swelling and injury took place in cerebral I/R injury,
causing the release of calcium. This process leads to
intracellular calcium overload, creating a positive feedback
loop. The present results showed that the inhibitor of
MCU-Ruthenium red decreased the mitochondrial Ca2?
overload associated with cerebral I/R injury. Activation of
CN counteracted this and so damped down and inhibited
the dephosphorylation of Drp1 and mitochondrial fission.
In conclusion, the present findings suggest that MCU
may play an essential role in mitochondrial fission. Inhibiting MCU activity may decrease mitochondrial fission by
preventing intracellular Ca2? overload and thus protecting
the cerebral cortex from I/R injury.
