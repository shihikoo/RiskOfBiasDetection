Abstract
Brain ischaemia (stroke) triggers an intense inflammatory response predominately mediated by the accumulation of inflammatory cells and
mediators in the ischaemic brain. In this context, regulatory T (Treg) cells, a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells with immunosuppressive and antiinflammatory properties, are activated in the late stages of the disease. To date, the potential therapeutic usefulness of Treg cells has not been
tested. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether Treg cells exert protection/repair following stroke. Both the adoptive transfer of Treg cells
into ischaemic rats and the stimulation of endogenous T-cell proliferation using a CD28 superagonist reduced the infarct size at 3â€“28 days following the ischaemic insult. Moreover, T cell-treated animals had higher levels of FoxP3 and lower levels of IL-1b, CD11b+ and CD68+ cells in
the infarcted hemisphere when compared with control animals. However, T-cell treatment did not alter the rate of proliferation of NeuN-, NCAMor CD31-positive cells, thereby ruling out neurogenesis and angiogenesis in protection. These results suggest that adoptive transfer of T cells is
a promising therapeutic strategy against the neurological consequences of stroke.

Introduction
Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are a subpopulation of CD4+ T cells
that play a role in maintaining immune homoeostasis, preventing autoimmunity and inflammation. Treg cells are also responsible for
limiting tissue damage during immune/inflammatory responses [1].
Following ischaemic stroke, cellular death by necrosis activates
an intense inflammatory response [2], which is characterized by the
accumulation of inflammatory cells and mediators in the ischaemic

brain and systemic changes in inflammatory cells, cytokines and
chemokines [3]. Evidence suggests that inflammation contributes to
tissue injury after stroke. Thus, it has been shown that defects in the
immune system, such as a genetic deficiency of adhesion molecules
or immunodeficiency, attenuate brain damage after ischaemia [3].
Furthermore, white blood cell counts and levels of C-reactive protein,
serum/plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a) are increased in stroke patients [4]; several of these factors
have been associated with stroke outcome [5] and recurrence [6].
Although it is known that immune responses contribute to tissue
damage, attempts to improve stroke outcome by immunosuppression
strategies have been so far unsuccessful [7]. However, immunosuppressive mechanisms that involve Treg cells may represent an effective strategy because Treg cells are natural agents that do not
suppress, but rather, control immune responses under physiological
or pathological conditions. Indeed, Treg cells have been successfully

used to reduce damage in ischaemic kidney injury [8] and liver
ischaemiaâ€“reperfusion injury [9].
In the context of brain ischaemia, it has been demonstrated that
Treg-cell levels increase after ischaemia [10, 11], and that mucosal
tolerance to E-selectin (a neuroprotectant) is mediated by Treg cells
[12]. However, the role of Treg cells in cerebral ischaemia remains
controversial. Thus, Liesz et al. [13] showed that animals subjected
to Treg-cell depletion presented larger infarct volumes, contradicting
the studies of Ren et al. [14], who used a different method to deplete
Treg cells and found no effects on infarct volumes. In addition, Kleinschnitz et al. [15] showed that Treg cells exacerbated brain injury
early after transient ischaemia, while others described that adoptive
regulatory T-cell therapy protected against cerebral ischaemia [16].
Finally, some authors have shown that Treg cells impair [17], whereas
others claim that they improve [18], angiogenesis after limb ischaemia, but little is known about the effects of Treg cells in angiogenesis
or neurogenesis after cerebral ischaemia. For these reasons, it has
been generally agreed that further studies are needed to clarify the
role of Treg cells in cerebral ischaemia [15, 19, 20].
In this work, we studied the role of Treg cells in brain ischaemia
using two different strategies (i.e., adoptive transfer of exogenous

Treg cells and stimulation of endogenous Treg cells); we analysed the
long-term effects of regulatory T cells after ischaemia with special
attention focused on their effects on neuroblasts division and angiogenesis.

Materials and methods
Purification and in vitro expansion of regulatory
T cells
Single-cell suspensions were obtained from the neck and mesenteric
lymph nodes of Sprague-Dawley male rats and incubated with FITCconjugated anti-CD4 and PE-conjugated anti-CD25 antibodies (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), both at 10 ll/106 cells. CD4+CD25+
(regulatory T cells; Treg) and CD4+CD25 cells (conventional T cells;
Tconv) were sorted by using a FACSAria I cell sorter (BD Biosciences),
achieving 84.7  4.8% and 97.4  0.9% of purity respectively. Fresh
Tconv cells were used in co-cultures with Treg cells for in vitro suppression assays, whereas Treg cells were expanded in vitro, as previously described [21].

In vitro suppression assays
In vitro suppression assays were performed to verify the immunosuppressing properties of expanded Treg cells. Freshly isolated Tconv cells
were stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester diacetate (CFSE)
dye (5 lM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 5 9 104 cells per well
(24-well plates) were stimulated to proliferate with 2 lg/ml of anti-TCR
mAb (BD biosciences) and 10 lg/ml of anti-CD28 mAb (clone JJ316;
BD Biosciences). To determine the immunosuppressing capacities of
Treg cells, different numbers of Treg cells were added (0, 1.25 9 104,
2.5 9 104 and 5 9 104). Tconv and Treg cells were co-cultured for
3 days, when cells were analysed by flow cytometry. Proliferation was
measured by determining the dilution of CFSE fluorescence [22].

Brain ischaemia rat model
Transient focal cerebral ischaemia was induced in Sprague-Dawley male
rats by intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (tMCAO),
performed as previously described [23]. Only rats with a â‰¥75% reduction in hemispheric cerebral blood flow (measure by laser Doppler flow)
were included in the study.
All procedures were performed under EU regulations (European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986 - 86/609/EEC, 2003/

65/CE, 2010/63/EU), with the approval of our institutionâ€™s ethics
committee.

Treatment groups
In a first set of experiments, we assessed the neuroprotective role of
the adoptive transfer of Treg cells. Twenty rats were randomized
between a control (n = 10) and a Treg-treated group (n = 10). Controls
received an i.v. injection of 1 ml of PBS, 2 hrs after the induction of
ischaemia, whereas Treg-treated rats received an injection of 3 9 106
expanded Treg cells in 1 ml of PBS. Infarct volumes were analysed by
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at days 1, 3, 7 and 10. At day 10,
animals were sacrificed and the brains were used to analyse IL1b,
FoxP3, CD11b and CD68 positive cells.
In the second set of experiments, rats received an i.v. injection of
1 ml of PBS (n = 8), or 500 mg of anti-CD28 mAb [24] (clone JJ316;
BD Biosciences) in 1 ml of PBS (n = 8), 4 days before the ischaemia.
Infarct volumes were analysed by MRI at days 1, 3, 7 and 10.
In a final set of experiments, rats were randomized between a control
group (n = 8) that received an i.v. injection of 1 ml of PBS, two hours
after the induction of ischaemia, and a Treg-treated group (n = 8) that
received an injection of 3 9 106 expanded Treg cells in 1 ml of PBS.
Infarct volumes were analysed by MRI at days 7, 14, 21 and 28.
Between days 7 and 21, all animals received an i.p. injection of BrdU

(Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs SG, Switzerland; 50 mg/Kg). At day 29, animals
were sacrificed and the brains were used to analyse BrdU+, NeuN+,
BrdU+NCAM+ and BrdU+CD31+ cells.

After measuring the volume of both brain hemispheres, oedema formation was quantified by the difference in hemispheric volumes by
using the following equation: Oedema (%) = 100*[1
(V1/V2)], with
V1 and V2 representing the contralateral and ipsilateral hemisphere volumes, respectively.

MRI analysis
Magnetic resonance images were acquired at 9.4 Tesla (Bruker Biospec,
Ettlingen, Germany). T2-weighted images were obtained by using RARE
(Rapid Acquisition with Refocused Echoes) pulse sequences with a train
of n = 4 echoes. Two imaging settings were used with the following
parameters: (1) Effective echo time TEeff = 45 ms, repetition time
TR = 3.5 sec., signal average n = 2, field-of-view FOV = 19.2 9
19.2 mm2, matrix 192 9 192 points, in-plane resolution of 0.1 9
0.1 mm2, 14 consecutive slices of 1 mm thickness and an acquisition
time of 5 min. 36 sec. (2) Effective echo time TEeff = 60 ms, repetition
time TR = 2.0 sec., signal average n = 1, field-of-view FOV = 28.8 9
28.8 mm, matrix 192 9 192 points, in-plane resolution of 0.15 9
0.15 mm2, 14 consecutive slices of 1 mm thickness and an acquisition
time of 1 min. 12 sec. Images were analysed and processed by a scientist blinded to the study by using Brukerâ€™s Paravision 5.1 software and
Image-J (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U. S. National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997â€“2011).

Western blot and ELISA analyses
Western blot analyses were performed to quantify FoxP3 expression (Treg
marker), and ELISA tests were performed to quantify interleukin-1b (IL-1b)
in the rat brain following ischaemia at day 10. Brains were extracted, and
the infarcted and contralateral hemispheres were separated and sonicated
with RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Gallen, Switzerland) and centrifuged
at 18,000 9 g for 30 min. at 4Â°C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were calculated by using the Bradford method.
Western blots were performed by using 50 lg of protein, separated
with 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free dehydrated
milk in TBS (Tris Buffered Saline, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hrs and incubated

Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) and rabbit anti-rat actin (1:3000;
Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). The membranes were incubated
with goat antimouse IgG-Cy3 and goat anti-rabbit IgG-Cy5 (1:3000 both;
GE Lifesciences, Munich, Germany) for 2 hrs and were digitized by using
a FXProplus scanner (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The intensity of bands
was analysed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).
ELISAs for IL-1b was acquired from GE Lifesciences, and the quantification of these proteins was performed according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.

Flow cytometry determination of neuroblasts
division and angiogenesis
Brain hemispheres were separated and homogenized by using a cell strainer. Cells were washed and stained by incubation (15 min.) with NCAM-PE
(10 ll per 106 cells; Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) or
CD31-PE (2 ll per 106 cells; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) antibodies. Then, cells were suspended in 100 ll of Cytofix-cytoperm (BD Biosciences) and stained for BrdU by using an APC BrdU Flow Kit from BD
Pharmigen (BD Biosciences), according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
Finally, cells were stained with NeuN-Alexa Fluor 488 (10 ll per 106 cells;
Chemicon Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA), and 50,000 cell events were
acquired in a BD FACS Aria I (BD Biosciences); the number of double-positive NeuN-BrdU, NCAM-BrdU or CD31-BrdU cells were counted [25].

Results
Cultured Tregs reduce in vitro proliferation of
T conventional cells
In vitro suppression assays combining fresh Tconv cells with
expanded Treg cells were performed to verify the immunosuppressor
properties of the expanded Treg cells. Treg cells were co-cultured for
3 days at a 1:1 ratio, achieving an 86.4  3.0% suppression of
Tconv cell proliferation (Fig. 1).

Immunohistochemistry for CD11b and CD68
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of inflammatory cells was performed on
three animals per group. Extracted brains were cut into 3-mm thick
coronal slices and immersed in a 20% sucrose solution for 2 hrs at
4Â°C. Brain slices were embedded in OCT (Sakura Finetek Inc., Torrance,
CA, USA) and stored at 80Â°C. For immunostaining, 10 lm coronal
sections were obtained by using a cryostat (Tissue-Tek Cryo3; Sakura
Finetek Inc.). Sections were further incubated with 3% H2O2 and 10%
methanol in PBS, to block endogenous peroxidase. Sections were subsequently incubated overnight at 4Â°C with primary antibodies against
CD68 (ED-1, 1:50 dilution; Abcam) and CD11b (OX42, 1:50 dilution; Abcam), followed by incubation with a biotin-conjugated secondary antirabbit antibody (1:200; Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA)
for 1 hr and streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase (Vecstatin Abc kit, Vector Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min. The slices were developed by incubation (3 min.) with DAB 0.05% (w/v; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and
visualized under an IX-51 microscope (Olympus Life and Material
Science Europe GMBH, Hamburg, Germany), which was attached to a
DS-U2 LCD camera (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA). All
slides were evaluated by a blinded, trained observer. Cells were counted
in five representative fields of 192 lm2 in the infarcted area.

control and Treg-treated animals. Figure 2C presents the temporal
evolution of infarct sizes, showing that Treg-treated animals displayed
smaller lesions compared with controls at day 3 (198.01  29.61
versus 349.84  48.50 mm2; P = 0.027), day 7 (149.16  19.43
versus 227.24  30.64 mm2; P = 0.049) and day 10 after occlusion
(120.38  12.94 versus 186.71  26.88 mm2; P = 0.041). In addition, rats treated with Treg cells also showed a reduction in brain
oedema at day 3 following occlusion (Fig. 2D).

Treg-treated animals present higher expression
of FoxP3 and lower inflammatory mediators in
the ischaemic hemisphere
Because Treg cells can infiltrate the ischaemic brain [11] (similar to
lymphocytes), we analysed the expression of FoxP3 by western blotting in the contralateral versus the infarcted brain hemispheres. As
shown in Figure 3A, FoxP3 expression in the infarcted hemisphere
was higher for Treg-treated rats compared with controls (3.5  0.3
versus 2.3  0.3 AU; P = 0.015).
Because FoxP3 was overexpressed in Treg-treated rats, and
considering that Treg cells are known immunosuppressing cells, we
analysed the levels of the inflammatory marker IL-1b in both brain
hemispheres. Levels of this marker were lower in the infarcted
hemisphere of Treg-treated animals (19.46  1.02 versus
25.92  2.58 pg/mg of total protein; P = 0.048; Fig. 3B).
To study the influence of Treg treatment on the activity of inflammatory cells, we analysed the inflammatory cell markers in the infarct

region of Treg-treated and control animals. Treg-treated animals
exhibited lower numbers of CD68+ cells (n = 17.93  1.07 versus
28.8  0.7; P = 0.005) and CD11b+ cells (n = 18.23  1.04 versus
24.85  0.55; P = 0.018) compared with control animals (Fig. 4).

Treatment with a CD28 superagonist also
induces protection
An additional experiment was performed to ensure the active role of
Treg cells in protection after cerebral ischaemia. A group of animals
were treated with CD28-SA (CD28 superagonist), which has been
shown to induce endogenous Treg-cell proliferation [24]. Treatment
was administered 4 days before ischaemia (time required to induce
Treg-cell proliferation, data not shown). We analysed the percentage
of change of infarct volume at days 3, 7 and 10 with respect to the initial infarct volume and observed a significant reduction in infarct
volumes at day 10 between controls ( 22.12  2.91%) and CD28SA-treated animals (versus 33.37  4.14%, P = 0.043). We also
observed that oedema was significantly lower at day 7 in CD28SA-treated animals (0.95  0.33% versus 2.8  0.35%, P = 0.002;
Fig. 5).

Treg cells did not impair endogenous
neuroblasts division or angiogenesis
We analysed the percentage of NeuN+BrdU+ and NCAM+BrdU+ cells
to quantify neural proliferation, and the percentage of CD31+BrdU+
cells to assess angiogenesis. The treatment with Treg cells did not
impair endogenous cell proliferation in any case (Fig. 7). The slightly
higher proliferation that resulted in the Treg-treated group was not
statistically significant.

Discussion
Stroke triggers an intense inflammatory response predominately
mediated by the accumulation of inflammatory cells and mediators in
the ischaemic brain. In this context, at late stages of the disease, Treg
cells are activated, and they may participate in limiting the inflammatory response.
In this study, we demonstrated that Treg cells reduce the infarct
volume in rats subjected to transient brain ischaemia. Animals treated
with Treg cells, 2 hrs after occlusion of the MCA, showed a 35.5%
reduction in infarct volume from day 3 up to day 28. In addition, Treg
cells reduced brain oedema by 35.7% at day 3. Infarct volumes were
also reduced when animals were treated with CD28-SA, an inductor
of endogenous Treg proliferation. Overall, we believe that these findings suggest a neuroprotective effect of the Treg cells.
Previous studies reported an increase in FoxP3 expression and in
Treg-cell numbers in the spleen and blood following experimental
ischaemia [10] and differences in Treg-cell numbers in the blood from
patients 7 days after a stroke [3]. In addition, several studies have
attempted to reveal the role of Treg cells in animal models, by depleting these cells before the induction of ischaemia. However, the results
of those studies are controversial. Liesz et al. [13] and Kleinschnitz
et al. [15] showed that Treg cells exacerbated brain injury early after
transient ischaemia, whereas Ren et al. [14] and Li et al. [16]
described that T-cell therapy protected against cerebral ischaemia
[15, 16]. The discrepancies in these results could be derived from the
different methods that were used in these studies. Thus, new studies
are necessary to evaluate the potential therapeutic usefulness of Treg
cells in brain ischaemia.
In this study, we aimed to investigate whether Treg cells exert
protection following stroke. In our strategy, instead of depleting Treg
cells, we aimed to analyse if the adoptive transfer of Treg cells or the
stimulation of endogenous Treg cells could be a therapeutic strategy
for the treatment of stroke. Both strategies reduced the infarct size
from day 3 after stroke and, in our opinion, these strategies are more

translational to the clinic. According to the STAIR criteria [26, 27], we
prolonged the observation periods after ischaemia, observing that
protection is also maintained at days 14, 21 and 28.
We tried to investigate the mechanisms of Treg-cell protections;
thus, we evaluated inflammation and, at longer time-points, neuroblasts division and angiogenesis. Higher levels of FoxP3 (Treg marker), lower levels of IL-1b and lower numbers of CD11b+ and CD68+
cells were found in the infarcted hemisphere of Treg-treated animals.
These findings may indicate that Treg numbers in the brain are
increased after stroke, and the protection observed could be mediated
by a reduction in inflammation. At longer time-points (28 days),
Treg-cell treatment did not impair the proliferation of NeuN+, NCAM+

or CD31+ cells, although a role in neuroblasts division and angiogenesis was not appreciated. Previous results in this regard were controversial, showing that Treg cells impair [17] or improve [18]
angiogenesis after limb ischaemia. In our study, we showed that Treg
cells did not impair neuroblasts division or angiogenesis.
In summary, we have found that the treatment of animals with
Treg cells 2 hrs after experimental ischaemia reduces infarct volume
from days 3 to 28. This reduction in infarct volume is accompanied
by a higher expression of FoxP3 (Treg marker) and a reduction in
inflammation in the infarcted brain hemisphere. These results suggest
that adoptive transfer of Treg cells is a promising therapeutic strategy
against the neurological consequences of stroke. Further studies
should help elucidate the exact mechanism underlying this neuroprotective effect of Treg cells.
