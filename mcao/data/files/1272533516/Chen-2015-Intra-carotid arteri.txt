Objective: We tested the hypothesis that transfusion of autologous peripheral blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells (PBDEPC) via the internal carotid artery could reduce brain-infarct zone (BIZ) and neurological deﬁcit in
rats following acute ischemic stroke (IS) induced by 50-min left middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Design: Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 60) were equally divided into group 1 [sham control (SC)], group 2
[SC-PBDEPC (5.7 × 106/kg)], group 3 (IS), group 4 [IS-low-dose PBDEPC (1.7 × 106/kg)], group 5 [IS-high-dose
PBDEPC (5.7 × 106/kg)]. Groups 2 to 5 received G-CSF (35 μg/kg subcutaneously) for 4 days before drawing
blood for PBDEPC culture.
Measurements and main results: By day 90, BIZ determined by histopathology (area) and brain MRI (volume)
were highest in group 3, lowest in groups 1 and 2, higher in group 4 than in group 5 (all p b 0.0001), and not
signiﬁcantly different between groups 1 and 2. Sensorimotor functional results exhibited an opposite pattern
of BIZ among groups 3 to 5 (p b 0.005). Angiogenesis biomarkers (SDF-1α, CXCR4, VEGF, angiopoietin-1) significantly increased progressively from groups 1 and 2 to group 5 (all p b 0.0001). Oxidative-stress (NOX-1, NOX-2,
oxidized protein), apoptotic (cleaved caspase 3 and PARP, mitochondrial Bax), inﬂammatory (MMP-9, TNF-α,
AQP-4, GFAP, iNOS), and brain-damaged (cytosolic cytochrome-C) biomarkers showed an identical pattern,
whereas anti-inﬂammatory (Bcl-2), mitochondrial preservation (mitochondrial cytochrome-C, PGC-1α), and
endothelial function (CD31+, vWF+, eNOS) biomarkers, and vessel density showed an opposite pattern of
BIZ among these ﬁve groups (all p b 0.001).
Conclusion: Higher-dose was superior to lower-dose EPC treatment for reducing BIZ and improving neurological
functional outcome.

1. Introduction
Acute ischemic stroke (IS) remains a leading cause of mortality
and disability worldwide [1–4], and yet, despite better understanding of
prevalence, etiology, and IS mechanisms, advancements in imaging
leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis, and improved antithrombotic agents, a universally accepted effective and safe management
strategy for patients with acute IS remains undeﬁned [5–8]. Thrombolysis
with tPA is an emerging treatment with promising results in speciﬁc
patient groups; however, the contraindications restrict its scope in clinical
practice [9–13]. Furthermore, tPA appears to have a relatively high

669

incidence of intracranial bleeding complications [9–13]. Therefore, an alternative treatment needs to be developed for patients with acute IS, particularly for those who are not candidates for thrombolysis.
Stem cell therapies have been developed for many diseases refractory to traditional management strategies [14–18]. Of these, ischemiarelated organ dysfunction has attracted the most intensive research,
with successful translation to human and animal subjects and promising results [14–18]. Undoubtedly, different types of stem cells have
different phenotype function. Abundant studies have shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), especially those of adipose-derived MSC
have capacity of anti-inﬂammation and immunomodulation [14,19,

20]. On the other hand, previous studies have shown that bone marrowderived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) [21–23] and circulatory derived CD34+ cells [24] have strong ability of angiogenesis and neovascularization. Thus, it is believed that endothelial progenitor cells are
superior to the mesenchymal stem cells for angiogenesis in ischemic organs/tissues.
Intriguingly, most of these studies, whether clinical or experimental,
have focused on the heart [15–17,21], kidney [14], lung [20], and extremity ischemia [22]. Stem cell therapy for brain ischemia has received
comparatively infrequent attention [19,25], especially regarding the application of autologous endothelial progenitor cells for acute IS [25].
With high angiogenesis capacity [22–24,26], minimal risk to the host

during EPC isolation [24], and relative ease of isolation requiring minimal
manipulation before transplantation, circulating EPCs [i.e., peripheral
blood-derived EPCs (PBDEPCs)] [15,18,24] have been used frequently
for the treatment of ischemic organ dysfunction. Additionally, limited
studies have revealed that CD45-[CD34/KDR+] EPCs may protect against
brain ischemia through the effects of EPC-mediated roles in vascular
health after ischemic stroke [27]. Given the reported beneﬁts of EPC therapy for improving ischemic organ dysfunction [15,18,23,25,26] mainly
through the underlying mechanisms of angiogenesis, we tested the hypothesis that autologous transfusion of EPCs via the internal carotid artery
could reduce brain infarct zone (BIZ) and neurological deﬁcit in rats
following acute IS.

2.2. Experimental model of acute ischemic stroke and corner test for
assessment of neurological function

2.1. Ethics
All animal experiments were approved by the Institute of Animal
Care and Use Committee at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital
and performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (NIH publication No. 85-23, National Academy
Press, Washington, DC, USA, revised 1996).

The protocol and procedure of using a rodent model of acute IS
have previously been detailed [19]. Adult male Sprague–Dawley
rats, weighing 325–350 g, were utilized (Charles River Technology,
BioLASCO Co. Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan). All animals were anesthetized by
2.0% inhalational isoﬂurane, supine on a warming pad (37 °C). After exposure of the left common carotid artery (LCCA) through a transverse

neck incision, a small incision was made on the LCCA through which a
nylon ﬁlament (0.28 mm in diameter) was carefully advanced into the
distal left internal carotid artery for occlusion of the left middle cerebral
artery (LMCA) to cause brain infarction of its supplied area. The nylon
ﬁlament was removed 50 min after occlusion, followed by closure of
the muscle and skin in layers. The rats were then placed in a portable animal intensive care unit (ThermoCare®) for 24 h. The sensorimotor
functional test (Corner test) was conducted for each rat at baseline
and on days 1 (24 h after procedure), 3, 7, 14, and 28 after acute IS induction as we recently described [19,28]. Brieﬂy, the rat was allowed
to walk through a tunnel and then into a corner, the angle of which

673

was 60°. To exit the corner, the rat could turn either left or right. A technician who was blind to the study design recorded the results. This test
was repeated 10 to 15 times with at least 30 s between each trial. We
recorded the number of right and left turns from 10 successful trials
for each animal and used the results for statistical analysis.
2.3. Peripheral blood was collected and cultured for endothelial progenitor
cells
The procedure and protocol for EPC isolation and culture were basic
on our previous reports [22,23]. In detail, rats in groups 2, 4 and 5 were

anesthetized with inhalational 2.0% isoﬂurane at day 21 prior to acute IS
induction to collected peripheral blood for culturing EPCs and autologous
transfusion. Groups 2 to 5 received G-CSF (35 μg/kg subcutaneously) for
4 days prior to drawing blood for PBDEPC culture. Isolated mononuclear
cells from peripheral blood were cultured in a 100 mm diameter dish
with 10 mL DMEM culture medium containing 10% FBS for 21 days.
Flow cytometric analysis was performed for identiﬁcation of cellular characteristics (i.e., EPC surface markers) after cell-labeling with appropriate
antibodies on day 21 of cell cultivation prior to implantation (please see
Fig. 3). Rats in groups 1 to 3 were anesthetized with inhalational 2.0%
isoﬂurane and only received an identical procedure of peripheral blood
sampling without further culture.
2.4. Animal grouping and the treatment protocol
Sixty rats were equally categorized into group 1 [sham control (SC),
i.e., by opening the neck skin and exploring the LCCA only], group 2
[SC + high-dose PBDEPC + (5.7 × 106/kg)], group 3 (IS only), group 4
[low-dose PBDEPC + (1.7 × 106 /kg)], and group 5 [high-dose
PBDEPC (5.7 × 106/kg)]. The Dil-stained (staining was performed
30 min prior to transfusion) EPCs were transfused directly and slowly
from LCCA 2 h later just after the acute IS induction after removing the
nylon ﬁlament. The wound was sutured after EPC transplantation.

appearance. The sucrose was then discarded and the brain soaked in
30% sucrose in 1 × PBS (freshly prepared) for 48 h. The infarcted and
non-infarcted parts were then collected. Finally, the OCT block (TissueTek, Sakura, Netherlands) was prepared for IHC and IF staining.
2.7. Determination of brain infarct area by H & E staining
To evaluate the impact of EPC treatment on brain infarction area,
coronal sections of the brain were obtained from six animals in each
group as 3 mm slices. H & E stain was performed for each cross section
of brain tissue to determine brain infarction area. The images obtained
were analyzed with Image Tool 3 (IT3) image analysis software
(University of Texas, Health Science Center, San Antonio, UTHSCSA;
Image Tool for Windows, Version 3.0, USA).
2.8. IF and IHC staining of brain specimens

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at days 3 and 90
after acute IS induction. Brieﬂy, during MRI measurements, mice were
anesthetized by 3% inhalational isoﬂurane with room air and placed in
an MRI-compatible holder (Biospec 94/20, Bruker, Ettingen, Germany).
Rectal temperature and respiration were monitored throughout the
procedure to ensure normal physiological conditions were being maintained. MRI data were collected using a Varian 9.4T animal scanner
(Biospec 94/20, Bruker, Ettingen, Germany) with a rat surface array.
The MRI protocol consisted of 40T2-weighted images. Forty continuous
slice locations were imaged with a ﬁeld-of-view of 30 mm × 30 mm and
an acquisition matrix dimension of 256 × 256 and slice thickness of
0.5 mm. The repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE) for each fast
spin-echo volume were 4200 ms and 30 ms, respectively. A custom software, ImageJ (1.43i, NIH, USA), was used to process the region of interest
(ROI). Planimetric measurements of images from MRI T2 were performed
to calculate the stroke volumes of cortex.

Frozen sections (4 μm thick) were obtained from BIA of each animal,
permeated with 0.5% Triton X-100, and incubated with antibodies
against NeuN (1:1000, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), glial ﬁbrillary
acid protein (GFAP; 1:500, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA), peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator [(PGC)-1α; 1:100, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruze, CA, USA], aquaporin4 (AQP4; 1:200,
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), CXCR4 (1:100, Abcam), stromal cellderived factor [(SDF)-1α; 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology], vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF; 1:400, Abcam), CD31 (1:100, BioSB,
Santa Barbara, CA, USA), von Willebrand factor (vWF; 1:200, Millipore),
doublecortin (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), γ-H2AX (1:500,
Abcam), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; 1:100, Abcam) at 4 °C overnight. Alexa Fluor488, Alexa Fluor568, or Alexa Fluor594-conjugated
goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG were used to localize signals. Sections
were ﬁnally counterstained with DAPI and observed with a ﬂuorescent
microscope equipped with epiﬂuorescence (Olympus IX-40).
For IHC staining, rehydrated parafﬁn sections were ﬁrst treated with
3% H2O2 for 30 min and incubated with Immuno-Block reagent (BioSB)
for 30 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies speciﬁcally against nestin (1:200, Abcam) at 4 °C
overnight.
Three brain sections were analyzed for each rat. For quantiﬁcation,
three randomly selected high-power ﬁelds (HPFs; ×400 for IHC and IF
studies) were analyzed in each section. The mean number of positivelystained cells per HPF for each animal was then determined by summation
of all numbers divided by 9.

2.6. Specimen collection and preparation for individual study

2.9. Western blot analysis of brain specimens

For examination of protein and gene expressions, animals in all
groups (n = 6) were sacriﬁced on day 90 after brain MRI, and the
brain of each rat was promptly removed, immersed in cold saline,
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C for individual
study. For immunoﬂuorescent (IF) and immunohistochemical (IHC)
staining studies, in another 6 animals in each group the brain was reperfused with normal saline via the carotid artery, removed, ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS (pH 7.4), and soaked in 20% sucrose in 1×
PBS (freshly prepared) until the brain took on a completely sunken

Equal amounts (50 μg) of protein extracts were loaded and
separated by SDS-PAGE using 12% acrylamide gradients. After electrophoresis, the separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to
a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane (Amersham Biosciences,
Amersham, UK). Nonspeciﬁc sites were blocked by incubation of
the membrane in blocking buffer [5% nonfat dry milk in T-TBS
(TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20)] overnight. The membranes were
incubated with monoclonal antibodies against CXCR4 (1:1000,
Abcam), SDF-1α (1:1000, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), VEGF

immunoglobulin IgG (1:2000, Cell Signaling) was used as a second antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The washing procedure was repeated
eight times within 1 h, and immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and exposure
to Medical X-ray ﬁlm (FUJI). For quantitation, ECL signals were digitized
using Labwork software (UVP, Waltham, MA, USA). A standard control
sample was loaded on each gel.

(1:400) as primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h, followed by

washing with PBS thrice. Ten minutes after the addition of anti-mouseHRP conjugated secondary antibody, the tissue sections were washed
with PBS thrice. Then 3,3′ diaminobenzidine (DAB) (0.7 g/tablet)
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added, followed by washing with PBS thrice after
1 min. Finally, hematoxylin was added as a counter-stain for nuclei,
followed by washing twice with PBS after 1 min. Three brain sections
were analyzed in each rat. For quantiﬁcation, three randomly selected
HPFs (200×) were analyzed in each section. The mean number per HPF
for each animal was then determined by summation of all numbers
divided by 9.

2.11. Statistical analyses
Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was
performed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni multiple-comparison post
hoc test. All analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software
for Windows version 8.2 (SAS institute, Cary, NC). A probability
value b 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. Autologous EPC transfusion limited brain infarct size and improved
recovery of neurological functional without tumorigenesis (Figs. 1 and 2)
By day 3 after acute IS procedure, brain MRI ﬁndings demonstrated
that the infarct volume (IV) was signiﬁcantly highest in group 3 and lowest in groups 1 and 2 (i.e., no brain infarction in groups 1 and 2), signiﬁcantly higher in group 4 than in group 5, but it showed no differences
between groups 1 and 2 or groups 3 and 4 (Fig. 1). Additionally, by day
90 after acute IS induction, IV was highest in group 3, lowest in groups
1 and 2, and signiﬁcantly higher in group 4 than in group 5, but it showed
no difference between groups 1 and 2 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the brain infarct area (i.e., identiﬁed by H.E. stain) showed an identical pattern of 90day brain IV among the ﬁve groups (Fig. 2: upper panel). Importantly, no
tumorigenesis was evident on brain MRI or pathology (i.e., H.E., stain) in
EPCs-treated rats.
Corner test (Fig. 2: lower panel) showed the attainment of a steady
state of neurological functional impairment on day 3 following acute IS
among groups 3 to 5. Signiﬁcant improvement in neurological function
became apparent in groups 4 and 5 but not in group 3 compared with
groups 1 and 2 on day 14. Further substantial improvements in groups
4 and 5 were noted on day 28 after acute IS.

highest in group 5, and signiﬁcantly higher in group 4 than in group 3,
but they showed no differences between groups 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). Additionally, the IF microscopic ﬁndings of CXCR4, SDF-1α (Fig. 4) and VEGF
(Fig. 5) showed an identical pattern of the Western blot results among
the ﬁve groups.
IHC staining (i.e., α-SMA) for identiﬁcation of small vessel density
demonstrated that the number of small vessels was highest in groups
1 and 2, lowest in group 3, and signiﬁcantly higher in group 5 than in
group 4, but it was similar between groups 1 and 2 (Fig. 5).

3.3. EPC therapy substantially up-regulated the expressions of endothelial
cell markers in brain infarct region by day 90 after IS (Fig. 6)
IF microscopy displayed that CD31 + and vWF + cells, two biomarkers of endothelial cell integrity, were highest in groups 1 and 2, lowest in group 3, and signiﬁcantly higher in group 5 than in group 4, but they
showed no differences between groups 1 and 2. Additionally, the protein
expressions of eNOS and CD31, two indicators of endothelial functional
integrity and angiogenic capacity, displayed an identical pattern of those
IF ﬁndings among the ﬁve groups.

3.4. EPC therapy down-regulated oxidative stress and ROS production in
infarcted brain by day 90 after IS (Fig. 7)
3.2. EPC therapy signiﬁcantly enhanced angiogenesis by day 90 after acute
IS (Figs. 3, 4 and 5)
The protein expressions of CXCR4, SDF-1α, VEGF and angiopoietin1, four indicators of angiogenesis, were lowest in groups 1 and 2 and

Oxidized protein expression, an index of oxidative stress, was lowest
in groups 1 and 2, highest in group 3, and signiﬁcantly higher in group 4

indicators of ROS, exhibited a similar pattern of oxidative stress
among the ﬁve groups.
3.5. EPC therapy markedly attenuated inﬂammatory reaction in infarcted
brain by day 90 after IS (Fig. 8)
The protein expressions of MMP-9, TNF-α and iNOS, three indices of
inﬂammatory biomarkers, were highest in group 3, lowest in groups 1
and 2, and signiﬁcantly higher in group 4 than in group 5, but no differences were found between groups 1 and 2. Protein expression of Bcl-2,
an anti-inﬂammatory indicator, exhibited an opposite pattern to these
three inﬂammatory biomarkers among all ﬁve groups.

3.6. EPC therapy further reduced in expressions of glial ﬁbrillary acid
protein (GFAP) and aquaporin4 (AQP4) and preservation of NeuN and
PGC-1α cells in infarcted brain by day 90 after IS (Figs. 9 and 10)
No positively Dil-stained cells were found in group 2 at the end of
the study period. The IF microscopic ﬁndings showed that GFAP expression, the principal intermediate ﬁlament of mature astrocytes, and
AQP4, an indicator of brain edema, were highest in group 3, lowest in
groups 1 and 2, and signiﬁcantly lower in group 5 than in group 4, but
it showed no difference between groups 1 and 2, suggesting that the reduction of IS-induced gliosis was better in higher-dose EPC rather than
in lower-dose EPC treatment (Fig. 9).

The IF microscopic ﬁndings displayed that the number of NeuN cells,
an index of neuron and PGC-1, a transcriptional coactivator for regulating
lipid catabolism, oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial metabolism and
biogenesis, showed an opposite pattern of GFAP expression among the
ﬁve groups (Fig. 10).
3.7. EPC therapy ameliorated apoptosis and mitochondrial damage
(Fig. 11)
The protein expressions of cleaved (i.e., active form) caspase 3 and
PARP, and mitochondrial Bax, three indicators of apoptosis, were
highest in group 3, lowest in groups 1 and 2, and signiﬁcantly higher
in group 4 than in group 5. Additionally, an increase in cytosolic cytochrome C, an index biomarker of mitochondrial damage, showed an
identical pattern of apoptotic expression, whereas the mitochondrial
cytochrome C, an indicator of mitochondrial integrity, exhibited an opposite pattern of cytosolic cytochrome C among the ﬁve groups.
3.8. EPC therapy enhanced the expressions of HO-1 and dobulecorin cells in
infarcted brain by day 90 after IS (Fig. 12)
The IF microscopic ﬁndings exhibited that the numbers of HO-1+
cells, an index of anti-oxidant and dobulecorin cells, an index of
neurogenesis, were lowest in groups 1 and 2, highest in group 5, significantly higher in group 4 than in group 3, but they showed no difference
between groups 1 and 2.
4. Discussion
This study, which investigated the therapeutic impact of EPCs on
neurological outcomes in rats after acute IS, provided several striking

implications. First, as compared with IS animals, neurological function
(i.e., by corner test) was early (i.e., at day 3) and signiﬁcantly improved
in IS animals that received EPC therapy. Second, the brain MRI and H.E.
stain studies showed that the BIZ was markedly reduced in IS animals
with low-dose EPCs treatment, and further reduced in IS animals with
high-dose EPC-treatment compared to IS animals without EPC therapy.
Third, the expressions of angiogenesis and neurogenesis biomarkers in
cellular and protein levels were notably higher in low-dose EPCstreated and higher still in high-dose EPCs-treated IS animals than in IS
animals without EPCs treatment, whereas the cellular damage markers
exhibited a reversed pattern to angiogenesis biomarkers among these
animals.
4.1. Impact of EPC therapy on reducing the brain infarct region by day 90
after acute IS
The therapeutic impact of EPC therapy on reducing BIZ and improving
neurological outcome has not been investigated before. Our previous
study revealed that adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC)
transfusion attenuated the brain infarct area and preserved neurological
function in rats after acute IS [19]. Given the (1) intrinsic capacity and potential advantages of EPC therapy for various settings of ischemia-related
organ dysfunction [17,18,22,25,27,28], and (2) our previous ﬁndings [19,
22,28], we extended this experimental study by using an identical
method of acute IS induction in rats to assess whether EPC therapy
also improved neurological outcomes in rats after IS. As expected,
histopathological ﬁndings (i.e., H.E. staining) displayed that the infarct area was signiﬁcantly reduced in low-dose EPC-treated animals as compared with those of IS animals without EPC treatment.
Importantly, high-dose EPC therapy offered an additional beneﬁt
over low-dose EPC therapy for reducing the infarct area.

One particularly important ﬁnding was that non-invasive MRI in
living animals showed signiﬁcantly lower brain infarct volume in the
low-dose EPC treated group than in IS group by day 90 after acute IS. Additionally, MRI demonstrated that BIZ was signiﬁcantly reduced in highdose EPC treated than in low-dose treated IS animals by day 3 as well as
by day 90. These ﬁndings indicate that a randomized prospective clinical trial would be beneﬁcial to test the therapeutic impact of EPCs on
acute IS patients who are not eligible for thrombolysis and have an ineffective response to conventional therapy.

IS procedure) were conducted for the rats after acute IS. Consistent
with the BIZ ﬁndings, neurological functional recovery (Fig. 2) was signiﬁcantly and consistently enhanced from day 3 to 28 in IS animals that
received EPC treatment than in those without. Our previous study
showed that transfusion of ADMSCs markedly improved rat neurological function after acute IS [19]. The results of this present study are
both consistent with our previous work [19] and provide another cellbased therapeutic option.

4.3. Proposed mechanisms for attenuating brain infarction size and
improving neurological function after EPC therapy

We were interested not only in the infarct size but also in assessing
neurological functional outcome after EPC therapy in animals after IS.
Serial neurological function tests (i.e., days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after the

Interestingly, there is abundant data implicating that stem cell therapy improves recovery of ischemia-related organ dysfunction mainly
through the angiogenesis [16,19,29,30]. In the present study, we found

that angiogenesis biomarkers at cellular (CXCR4+, SDF-1α+, CD31+,
vWF +, VEGF +) and protein (CXCR4, SDF-1α, VEGF, angiopoietin,
CD31, eNOS) levels, neurogenesis (NeuN, doublecortin, nestin) and
anti-oxidant (HO-1) cellular levels were substantially higher in IS animals with low-dose EPC treatment, and even higher in IS animals with
high-dose EPC treatment, than in IS animals without treatment. Additionally, the number of small vessels in the brain ischemic region
showed an identical pattern to these angiogenesis parameters among
these three groups of IS animals. Our ﬁndings, in addition to reinforcing
the ﬁndings of previous studies [16,19,29,30], could, at least in part, explain why neurological dysfunction had better recovery in EPC-treated
animals than in those without EPC treatment. These ﬁndings also reasonably explain why the BIZ was signiﬁcantly reduced in low-dose EPCtreated, and further signiﬁcantly reduced in high-dose EPC-treated, animals than in IS animals without treatment.
Intriguingly, ADMSC transplantation ameliorated cellular apoptosis
and DNA damage, and preserved the integrities of mitochondria and
PGC-1α, ultimately preserving ischemia-related organ dysfunction in
various experimental studies [14,19,20]. The essential ﬁnding in the present study was that, as compared to sham control animals, the apoptotic,
DNA and mitochondrial damage biomarkers in the brain ischemic area
were notably higher in IS animals without treatment. However, these parameters were signiﬁcantly reduced in low-dose EPC-treated and further
reduced in high-dose EPC-treated animals. In this way, our ﬁndings, in addition to strengthening the ﬁndings of previous studies [14,19,20], could
once again, explain why EPC treatment diminished BIZ and improved
neurological outcome in animals after IS.
Numerous studies have previously identiﬁed an association between
increased inﬂammation, oxidative stress and cell death after an acute

ischemic attack [14,16,19,20,22,26,30]. The principal ﬁnding in the present study was that the inﬂammatory and oxidative-stress parameters in
the brain ischemic region was remarkably higher in IS animals than in
the sham control. This corroborated the ﬁndings of previous studies [14,
16,19,20,22,26,30]. Of importance, these inﬂammatory and oxidativestress biomarkers were markedly reduced in IS animals after low-dose
EPC treatment and further markedly reduced in IS animals with highdose EPC therapy. Therefore, this ﬁnding could, once more, explain why
the recovery of neurological dysfunction and BIZ preservation were best
in high-dose EPC-treated IS animals, and were better in low-dose EPC
treated IS animals than in untreated IS animals.
Our previous studies have displayed that the expressions of GFAP
and AQP4 were signiﬁcantly enhanced in rats after IS [19,28] and were
notably reduced after ADMS [19]. Consistently, these two parameters
were signiﬁcantly increased in IS without treatment. However, these
two biomarkers were signiﬁcantly reduced after low-dose EPC treatment
and further signiﬁcantly reduced in high-dose EPC treatment. These
ﬁndings, perhaps, also explain why EPC transfusion reduced the BIZ and
improved neurological function in IS animals.
5. Conclusion
Higher-dose was superior to lower dose EPC treatment for reducing
BIZ and improving neurological functional outcome.
5.1. Study limitations
This study has limitations. First, examination of the cell homing of
transfused EPC by in vivo tracking, or by detecting the Y-chromosome

DNA in infarcted brain of EPC-treated female rats which would provide
evidence for the localization/distribution/functional recovery of
transfused EPC in correlation to the functional outcome had not
been approached in the present study. Second, although abundant data
support the impact of EPC therapy on improving neurological outcome
in rats after acute IS, the exact underlying mechanisms of this therapy
have not been identiﬁed in the present study. Thus, the proposed mechanisms underlying the observed protection of EPC treatment against acute
IS only based on our ﬁndings have been summarized in Fig. 13. Third,
without comparison, we do not know whether EPCs or ADMSCs are superior, or similar, for improving outcomes after acute IS.
In conclusion, high-dose EPC carotid intra-arterial transfusion was
better than lower-dose EPC transfusion for attenuating BIZ and improving
neurological dysfunction after acute IS in rats. This might be explained
mainly through the enhancement of angiogenesis and neurogenesis,
and reducing inﬂammation, oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis.
