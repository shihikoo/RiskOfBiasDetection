Former studies indicated that programmed cell death 5 (PDCD5) protein could accelerate the process
of apoptosis in response to some stimuli in various kinds of cells via the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that protein level of PDCD5 are related
to autophagic activity after focal ischemic brain injury in rats. One hundred and twenty-ﬁve SpragueDawley rats (male) were randomly divided into the following groups: Sham operated, Middle Cerebral
Artery Occlusion/Reperfusion (MCAO), MCAO + Control siRNA and MCAO + PDCD5 siRNA. Outcome measurements include neurobehavioral outcomes, brain infarct volume, brain water content, BBB disruption,
MRI and double ﬂuorescence labeling. Western blot and histopathophysiological techniques were used
to measure the expression of PDCD5 and some pro-autophagic proteins such as Beclin 1 and the LC3II/LC3-I ratio. The study found that decreased PDCD5 expression via intracerebroventricular injection of
PDCD5 siRNA signiﬁcantly improved the neurobehavioral outcome, reduced the infarct ratio, cerebral
edema and BBB disruption. These results were associated with decreased expression of Beclin 1 and the
LC3-II/LC3-I ratio in the penumbra area. Rapamycin, an inducer of autophagy, partially weakened the
effect of PDCD5 siRNA. In conclusion, this study suggested that PDCD5 was a key regulator of autophagy
that might play an important role following MCAO injury.

1. Introduction
Stroke especially the ischemic stroke which might induce severe
neurological dysfunction or even death caused high rate of mortality and morbidity throughout the world [1]. Morphologic changes
including apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis occurring in neurons
after cerebral ischemia produce complex features of cell death. Cell
death in the penumbra not only bears a resemblance to necrosis

or apoptosis, but also exhibits the biochemical and morphological
characteristics of autophagic cell death [2].
Autophagy is involved in type-II programmed cell death and
accumulating evidence has demonstrated increased autophagy in
response to cerebral ischemia [3]. The function of autophagy is complex, and depends on brain maturity, region, insult severity and
stage of ischemia [4]. Until now, results from transmission electron
microscopy scanning are considered to be the most reliable criteria
to judge the occurrence of autophagy, though other biochemistry
parameters such as LC3 and Beclin 1 are also used. LC3 is associated
with autophagosome membranes after post-translational modiﬁcations through the cleaving of a C-terminal fragment immediately
after synthesis to yield a cytosolic form called LC3-I which is fur-

Z. Jiang et al. / Neuroscience Letters 566 (2014) 298–303

ther converted to LC3-II (an autophagosome-associating form). The
amount of LC3-II correlates with the extent of autophagosome formation [5]. Beclin 1 is also important for the assembling of other
autophagic proteins in the pre-autophagosomal membrane [6].
PDCD5, also designated as TFAR19 (TF-1 cell apoptosis related
gene-19), was ﬁrstly cloned and sequenced from TF-1 cells
undergoing cytokine-deprived apoptosis [7]. Our previous study
indicated PDCD5 could induce apoptosis and over-expression of
PDCD5 had the deleterious effect to ischemic neurons in vivo study.
Meanwhile, the decrease of PDCD5 may provide protective effects
through the reduction of apoptotic-related proteins such as p53,
Bax, and caspase-3 [8]. Other reports on PDCD5 indicated that
decreased expression of PDCD5 had been characterized for human
tumors such as astrocytic gliomas [9]. However, its relevance to
autophagic-type PCD still needs to be elucidated.
In this study, we tried to demonstrate the role of PDCD5 and
its relationship with neuronal autophagy following focal cerebral
ischemia. Accordingly, we used siRNA against PDCD5 to attenuate the expression of endogenous PDCD5 and then observed the
corresponding results of brain edema, blood–brain barrier (BBB)
disruption, and neurological deﬁcits. Western blot and immunohistochemistry techniques were used to evaluate the expression of
endogenous PDCD5 and key pro-autophagy proteins such as Beclin
1 and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and MCAO model
Animals used in this experiment were supplied by the Animal
Center of Peking University Health Science Center (certiﬁcate No.
SCXK2011-0012). The protocol was approved by the Committee on
the Ethics of Animal Experiments at the Health Science Center of
Peking University. We made efforts to reduce the number of animals for use and to minimize animal suffering to the lowest level.
One hundred and twenty-ﬁve Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 280–300 g were randomly divided into the following groups:
Sham surgery (n = 30), MCAO (n = 30), MCAO treated with Control
siRNA (n = 30), MCAO treated with PDCD5 siRNA (n = 30). Another
5 rats were treated with rapamycin. We excluded the dead animals that died due to surgical complications, severe brain edema
or subarachnoid hemorrhage during the experiment.
We setup the focal cerebral ischemia model by blocking the
intraluminal MCA with a nylon suture, according to the report
described by Longa et al. [10] and Kawamura et al. [11]. The operation procedure was totally the same as described in our previous
study [8].
2.2. In vivo PDCD5 siRNA and rapamycin transfer
In vivo transfer was performed according to a method described
previously [12]. The stereotaxic coordinates were 0.8 mm posterior,
1.5 mm lateral to the bregma and 4.5 mm ventral to the surface
of the skull. 1.25 ␮g/5 ␮L PDCD5 siRNA (Santa Cruz, sc-270337) or
Control siRNA-A (Santa Cruz, sc-37007) was diluted with the same
volume of EntransterTM -in vivo transfection reagent (Engreen, Beijing, China). The solution was mixed gently by pipetting the solution
up and down and injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.), under
anesthesia and within 60 min of reperfusion, using a microsyringe
(Hamilton, Nevada, USA) under the guidance of the stereotaxy
instrument (Kent Scientiﬁc Corporation, CT, USA).
Rapamycin was given as an inducer of autophagy that was discovered to have potent immunosuppressive and anti-proliferative
properties [13]. Rapamycin with the 2% ﬁnal ethanol concentration was dissolved in ethanol and diluted in saline solution. Then,
35 pmol rapamycin (Sigma, R0395) was injected into the right lat-

299

eral ventricle, prior to the transfer of PDCD5 siRNA and using the
same method, followed by 24 h of reperfusion.
2.3. Cerebral ischemia assessment by MRI
Rat brains were examined in a 3.0-Tesla MRI animal scanner
(Magnetom Trio with TIM system, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).
The rats in each group (n = 5) were examined by MRI at
60 min post occlusion and 24 h after reperfusion. Custom-made
surface“birdcage coil” (inner diameter 30 mm) was used. Apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) was measured at 60 min post
occlusion by using spin-echo diffusion-weighted echo-planar
imaging. T2 maps were also acquired at 24 h after reperfusion using fast spin-echo with two effective echo times
(12.5/20 ms). MRI parameters were set at TE = 30 ms, TR = 3000 ms,
view-ﬁeld = 25.6 mm × 25.6 mm, matrix = 96 × 96 (reconstructed to
128 × 128), thickness = 1.5 mm and gap = 0 mm. The initial lesion
volume was deﬁned using ADC and was measured by using the
threshold of mean TC-value from the normal hemisphere minus
three-time of standard deviation. Final infarct volume was deﬁned
using T2 maps using threshold of the mean T2-value of the normal
hemisphere plus double standard deviation.
2.4. Infarct volume measurement
2,3,7-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma Inc.) staining
(n = 5) was performed at 24 h after MCAO as described previously
[14]. The infarction area and the ipsilateral hemisphere area of each
section were measured using the software of Image J. Infarct volume was calculated by infarcted area/total ipsilateral hemisphere.
2.5. Neurological deﬁcits
Neurological scores were calculated by another researcher, who
was blinded to the animal group, at 24 h based on the scoring system of Garcia et al. [15]. The neurobehavioral score is 3–18, and the
lower the score, the more severe the injury.
2.6. Evans blue leakage
BBB permeability was detected by measuring the Evans-blue
extravasation. Evans-blue leakage measurement was performed as
described previously [16]. Evans-blue’s amount in the supernatant
was measured at a wavelength of 610 nm spectrophotometrically
and compared with readings obtained from standard solutions.
2.7. Brain water content
We used the method described previously to measure the brain
water content [17]. Brain water content was calculated by [(wet
weight − dry weight)/wet weight] × 100%.
2.8. IgG staining
BBB leakage was also measured by immunolocalization of IgG
as previously described [18]. Brain tissue sections were incubated with IgG biotin-conjugated antibody 1:100 (Santa Cruz Inc.)
overnight at 4 ◦ C and treated with an ABC staining kit.
2.9. Assessment of autophagy level with immunohistochemistry
staining and Western blot
To evaluate the autophagy level, two groups of experiments
were conducted. Firstly, the LC3 and Beclin 1 positive cells
were stained by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry
was performed in the way described previously [19] using the
antibodies as follows: (1) PDCD5 (sc-162004), (2) LC3 (MBL,
PM036), and (3) Beclin 1 (MBL, PD017).

Next, the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, level of Beclin 1 and PDCD5 were
determined under each condition by Western blot. We determined
the ischemic penumbra according to the methods described previously [20]. The penumbra region was homogenized and protein
was extracted. Protein samples (50 ␮g) were loaded onto polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane. The membranes were blocked by the LC3 and Beclin 1
primary antibodies overnight at 4 ◦ C and then processed with secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature
for 1 h. Immunoblot was probed and then exposed to X-ray ﬁlm. We
scanned the X-ray ﬁlms and detected the optical density by Bio-Rad
image analysis.
2.10. Data analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical signiﬁcance was
assured by ANOVA performed using a one-way ANOVA followed
by the Tukey test. The neurological behavior test was compared by
Kryskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison
procedures. A probability value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Fig. 1C. We observed a signiﬁcant increase in infarction volume in
MCAO (25.88 ± 4.81%) and Control siRNA groups (27.28 ± 11.16%)
compared to sham group. The PDCD5 siRNA group showed a
signiﬁcant reduction compared to MCAO/Control siRNA groups
(17.49 ± 2.29%, p < 0.05 vs. MCAO/Control siRNA, respectively).

3.2. Rapamycin partially attenuated PDCD5 siRNA-induced
neuroprotection
Previous study showed that i.c.v. injection of rapamycin as an
autophagy inducer at a dose of 35 pmol could effectively induce
autophagic activity [21]. In this study, the infarct areas in PDCD5
siRNA + rapamycin group were signiﬁcantly bigger than those in
PDCD5 siRNA group (Fig. 1B). Accordingly, corresponding infarction volumes shown in Fig. 1D quantitatively demonstrated that
rapamycin administration increased the PDCD5 siRNA-reduced
infarction volumes (p < 0.05), further suggesting that rapamycin
may attenuate the neuroprotective effects induced by PDCD5
siRNA.

3. Results
3.1. PDCD5 siRNA reduced infarction volume following focal
brain ischemia
Rat brains were evaluated for infarction volume using TTC staining and imaging software 24 h after MCAO injury. Representative
samples of TTC-stained brain sections were shown in Fig. 1A,
with corresponding infarction volumes and statistic data shown in

3.3. PDCD5 siRNA reduced neurobehavioral deﬁcits
The mean neurobehavioral scores were observed at 24 h and
shown in Fig. 1E. There was a marked decline in MCAO/Control
siRNA groups. The PDCD5 siRNA showed a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in neurobehavioral deﬁcits when compared to
MCAO/Control siRNA groups (p < 0.05).

Fig. 2. Outcomes of BBB leakage and MRI. (A) Evan’s-blue-stained brain sections from rats sacriﬁced at 24 h following MCAO. We observed the negative dye leakage in sham
group while notable staining was seen in lesion areas of MCAO/Control siRNA groups. The PDCD5 siRNA group displayed weaker Evan’s-blue. (B) The amount of Evans-blue
leakage was determined by measuring the brain-extracted Evan’s-blue by spectrophotometry at 610 nm and expressed as ␮g/g of brain tissue. PDCD5 siRNA reduced Evan’sblue content compared with MCAO/Control siRNA groups (# p < 0.05). (C) Brain water content measured in the ipsilateral hemisphere, contralateral hemisphere, brain stem
and cerebellum. In PDCD5 siRNA group, there was a signiﬁcant decrease of brain water content in the ipsilateral hemisphere compared with MCAO/Control siRNA groups
(# p < 0.05). However, there was no difference in the contralateral hemisphere, brain stem and cerebellum from all groups. (D) Representative MRI images from rats in various
groups’ 60 min ADC post occlusion and 24 h T2 map after reperfusion. (E) Quantitative analysis of initial lesion (ADC) and ﬁnal lesion volume (T2 map) in various groups.
There were no statistical differences as expected from MCAO, Control siRNA and PDCD5 siRNA groups (# p > 0.05), by the comparison of initial lesions, respectively. However,
the ﬁnal lesion volume of the PDCD5 siRNA group was smaller than that of the MCAO/Control siRNA groups (*p < 0.05). (F) No staining of IgG was observed in the cerebral
cortex in Sham group (A1 and B1). In the penumbra area, strong staining was seen in MCAO (A2 and B2) and Control siRNA groups (A3 and B3). A lot of positive granules
were visible around the blood vessels and in some cells that might phagocytize these granules. PDCD5 siRNA group (A4 and B4) demonstrated a slighter staining area and
fewer total cells.

3.4. PDCD5 siRNA reduced BBB disruption and brain edema
BBB permeability was measured using the Evan’s-blue technique (Fig. 2A and B). Compared with sham group, MCAO/Control
siRNA groups demonstrated an increased extravasation of Evan’sblue dye in the ipsilateral hemisphere at 24 h. Treatment with
PDCD5 siRNA signiﬁcantly reduced the amount of Evan’s-blue
extravasation (p < 0.05).
Brain water content was demonstrated in Fig. 2C. There was
no signiﬁcant difference among all groups for the water content
in the contralateral hemisphere, brain stem and cerebellum. The
high SEMs might come from the procedure that we weighed the
brain-stem and cerebellum after the two hemispheres. It will take
a few seconds and the time interval might affect the data we got
from the balance. However, compared to sham animals, there was a
signiﬁcant increase in brain water content in MCAO/Control siRNA
groups in the ischemic side (p < 0.05). Subsequent treatment with
PDCD5 siRNA showed a statistically signiﬁcant reduction in brain
water content (p < 0.05).
3.5. PDCD5 siRNA improved MRI outcome
MRI is considered to be noninvasive and the most promising
approach for examining ischemic injury in real time. By using this
technique, we evaluated the initial and ﬁnal cerebral ischemia

lesion in each condition, and the representative images were shown
in Fig. 2D. The initial ADC volumes showed in Fig. 2E demonstrated
that the model was stabilized and comparable (MCAO: 245 ± 9,
Control siRNA: 238 ± 8, PDCD5 siRNA: 246 ± 6 mm3 , # p > 0.05).
However, the ﬁnal T2 lesion volume of the PDCD5 siRNA group
was smaller than that of the MCAO/Control siRNA groups (190 ± 5
versus 241 ± 12 and 232 ± 6 mm3 , *p < 0.05, respectively).
3.6. PDCD5 siRNA signiﬁcantly reduced Blood–brain barrier
leakage
No IgG staining was observed in the cerebral cortex in sham
group (Fig. 2F – A1 and B1). But in penumbra area, strong staining was seen in MCAO (Fig. 2F – A2 and B2) and Control siRNA
groups (Fig. 2F – A3 and B3). Many positive granules were visible
around the blood vessels. PDCD5 siRNA group (Fig. 2F – A4 and B4)
demonstrated a slighter staining area and less IgG staining cells.
3.7. PDCD5 siRNA signiﬁcantly reduced the autophagic activity
Immunohistochemical staining showed increased expressions
of PDCD5, Beclin 1 and LC3 in penumbra regions at 24 h following
MCAO (Fig. 3A – A2, B2, and C2)/Control siRNA group (Fig. 3A –
A3, B3, and C3) which were negative or seldom expressed in sham
animals (Fig. 3A – A1, B1, and C1). The PDCD5 siRNA reduced the

Fig. 3. Immunohistochemistry staining, double immunoﬂuorescence staining and Western blot analysis. (A) PDCD5 positive cells in sham group mainly localized in the
cytoplasm or cytomembrane (A – A1). After MCAO, it showed transposition to the nuclei in the infarction regions (A – A2). The PDCD5 siRNA (A – A4) group demonstrated
a decreased number of positive cells. Almost no LC3 or Beclin 1 in the infarcted areas was observed in sham-operated rats (A – B1 and A – C1). Massive immunoreactivity
of LC3 was localized in the infarction regions at 24 h in MCAO/Control siRNA groups. However, the extent of LC3 immunostaining was lessened in PDCD5 siRNA group (A –
C4). Similar results were found for Beclin 1 (A – B1–4). Bar = 50 ␮m. The arrows show positive immunostaining cells. (B) The PDCD5 expression was signiﬁcantly increased in
MCAO, Control siRNA and PDCD5 siRNA groups compared to that of sham (# p < 0.05). Administration of PDCD5 siRNA reduced the PDCD5 expression. The expression levels of
LC3 (C) and Beclin 1 (D) were signiﬁcantly increased in MCAO/Control siRNA groups compared to those of sham group (# p < 0.05). However, administration of PDCD5 siRNA
reduced the LC3-II/I ratio and Beclin 1 level. (E) Double immunoﬂuorescence staining showed the co-localization of PDCD5 (E-A1 and E – B1) with MAP2 (E – A2) but rarely
with astrocytes shown by GFAP (E – B2). PDCD5 (E – C1) also co-localized with LC3 (E – C2) shown by the merged image (E – C3) in the cerebral cortex at 24 h after MCAO.
PDCD5 (green) was expressed by ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). MAP2, GFAP and LC3 (red) were expressed by tetramethylrhodamineisothiocyanate (TRITC). Scale bars:
50 ␮m. White arrows indicated examples of the positive cells. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
the article.)

expression of PDCD5, Beclin 1 and LC3 in the penumbral areas in
MCAO/Control siRNA groups (Fig. 3A – A4, B4, and C4).
Western blot analysis of the infarcted brain tissue in each
group showed that the PDCD5 expression level was signiﬁcantly
increased in MCAO, Control siRNA and PDCD5 siRNA groups compared to that in sham group. However, PDCD5 siRNA administration
clearly reduced the PDCD5 expression (Fig. 3B, *p < 0.05). Nevertheless, the LC3-II/I ratio and Beclin 1 level in MCAO/Control
siRNA groups were increased compared with those in sham (Fig. 3C
and D, # p < 0.05). Following administration of PDCD5 siRNA, the
LC3-II/I ratio and Beclin 1 level were signiﬁcantly decreased
(*p < 0.05).

3.8. Double ﬂuorescence labeling showed the co-staining of
PDCD5 with MAP2, GFAP and LC3
Double ﬂuorescence labeling revealed positive co-staining (yellow) of PDCD5 (green) to MAP2 (red, marker for neurons) (Fig. 3E –
A2) but rarely with astrocytes to GFAP (red, marker for astrocyte)
(Fig. 3E – B2), indicating that PDCD5 is expressed in neurons and
astrocytes.
Double ﬂuorescence labeling of PDCD5 with LC3 in the infarction
regions at 24 h showed that PDCD5 (Fig. 3E – C1) was partially colocalized with LC3 (Fig. 3E – C2) in neuronal tissues.

4. Discussion
In the present study, we found that autophagy was activated in
the penumbra at 24 h after focal cerebral ischemia. PDCD5 siRNA
via i.c.v. transfer at the onset of reperfusion signiﬁcantly decreased
the infarct size and brain edema, mitigated neurological deﬁcits,
protected the integrity of the BBB and reduced the induction of
autophagy at 24 h after ischemia. However, the neuroprotective
effects on ischemic injury induced by PDCD5 siRNA were partially
reversed by the autophagy inducer rapamycin, shown by TTC staining. These results suggested that the inhibition of the autophagic
pathway partially contributed to the mechanism of protection to
cerebral ischemia induced by PDCD5 inhibition.
Former studies indicated that over-expression of PDCD5 facilitates apoptosis independent of types of cells and apoptosis
stimulators [8]. Simultaneously, our previous report showed the
involvement of PDCD5 in the regulation of apoptosis in cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury [8]. We found in this previous study
that PDCD5 induced apoptosis and over-expression of PDCD5 are
harmful to ischemic neurons in vivo. Meanwhile, inhibition of
PDCD5 may be protective via reduction of apoptotic-related proteins such as p53, Bax and caspase-3. However, the relationship
between PDCD5 and autophagy is still unknown. In this manuscript,
we described that the protective effect of PDCD5 siRNA not only
came from the inhibition of apoptosis, but also from the inhibition of autophagy. In order to conﬁrm this hypothesis, we tested

Z. Jiang et al. / Neuroscience Letters 566 (2014) 298–303

the effects of PDCD5 siRNA on autophagy in a rat brain ischemic
model. Consistent with our hypothesis, in the MCAO group all the
morphological and biochemical characteristics of autophagy were
enhanced. Meanwhile, PDCD5 inhibition reduced the ratio of LC3II/I
and the expression of Beclin 1. All the data suggested that PDCD5
siRNA attenuated the process of autophagy, so we concluded that
inhibition of PDCD5 affected the process of autophagic PCD.
Autophagic programmed cell death plays an important role but
is a double-edge-sword in physiological and pathophysiological
processes [22] such as neurodegenerative diseases [23]. Proper
methods for detection and controlling of cell autophagy may help
for the treatment of various kinds of diseases. Recent reports indicated that Beclin 1, an important gene modulating cell autophagy,
was involved in the process of cell apoptosis by enhancing the
activity of caspase-9 [24]. PDCD5 is a well-known broad-spectrum
apoptosis-accelerating gene. In this study, we showed for the ﬁrst
time that PDCD5 was involved the autophagic-type PCD. It is
implied that it might play essential roles for proper cell growth
and death, and have applications in the process of disease diagnosis and treatment. This is important because cellular death leads
to a variety of complications, including the accumulation of brain
edema (which causes a rise in intracranial pressure), a reduction
in cerebral blood ﬂow (causing further ischemic damage such as
neuronal cell death and long term neurobehavioral impairment)
[25]. Through inhibition of PDCD5 with siRNA, we could subsequently reduce brain edema and improve BBB disruption following
MCAO injury. This preservation of structural integrity translated to
improvements in neurobehavioral capabilities as well. However,
the mechanisms that underlie its role in cell autophagy are currently unclear. Further experiments should be conducted to explore
the molecules that interact with PDCD5.
We found that once PDCD5 was inhibited by siRNA, the expression of Beclin 1 and LC3 were attenuated, suggesting that PDCD5
mediated the autophagic cell death pathway through Beclin 1 and
LC3 following MCAO injury. The proportion of LC3-II/LC3-I, which
stands for the membrane bound LC3-phospholipid conjugate modiﬁed by endogenous Atg7 and Atg3 and the soluble unlipidated form
of LC3, respectively, increases dramatically in autophagic cells [26].
A better understanding of the mechanism between autophagy
and PDCD5 interaction might play an important role in the prevention and treatment of cerebral ischemic injury.
