Ethnopharmacological relevance: Geniposide is a bioactive substance derived from gardenia, which has
been used in traditional Chinese preparation, such as “Xing-Nao-Jing” (XNJ) for stroke treatment. Stroke
and the ingredients of herbal preparation affect the pharmacokinetics of geniposide. A comparative
pharmacokinetic study of geniposide in stroke and sham-operated rats after administration of XNJ and
geniposide was proceeded to evaluate the effect of stroke on pharmacokinetics of geniposide, while the
inﬂuence of other components in XNJ was determined by using gardenia extract and geniposide–borneol
compounds in rats with stroke to compare.
Materials and methods: Stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion
2 h later. Plasma concentration of geniposide was determined by HPLC. Various pharmacokinetic
parameters were estimated from the plasma concentration versus time data using non-compartmental
methods.
Results: The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC0  t) in stroke after
administration of XNJ were 5.97 73.82 μg/mL, and 570.06 7274.32 μg  min/mL, respectively, which
were 5 times compared with sham-operated rats or the stroke-afﬂicted rats given geniposide. In stroke,
the Cmax and AUC0  t of geniposide–borneol group and gardenia extraction group were close to XNJ group
and geniposide group, respectively. The geniposide–borneol group had a higher value.
Conclusion: Stroke improved the absorption of geniposide in XNJ. Borneol may be the key ingredient in
XNJ improving the absorption of geniposide.

1. Introduction
Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, belonging to Rubiaceae family, is
distributed naturally over Asia and North America. It has been
widely used in food additives, natural pigments and in centuriesold traditional Chinese medicine. Geniposide (Fig. 1A) is an iridoid
glycoside extracted from Gardenia, and has been used for the
quality of Gardenia for its therapeutic effects Studies showed that
geniposide possesses diverse pharmacological activities including
anti-inﬂammatory (Koo et al., 2006), antithrombotic (Suzuki et al.,
2001), antiangiogenic (Koo et al., 2004), neuroprotective (Lee
et al., 2006; Hennebelle et al., 2007) and anti-depression (Xue
et al., 2013) properties. So geniposide has drawn attention in the
treatment of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases in recent
years (Zeng et al., 2013). In fact, Gardenia has been used in
traditional Chinese preparation, such as Xing-Nao-Jing (XNJ) to
treat stroke. XNJ derived from An-Gong-Niu-Huang-Wan, is effective in stroke therapy (Shen et al., 2003). XNJ consists of only

4 herbs, namely, Moschus, Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, borneol and
Curcuma aromatica Salisb.
Stroke is deﬁned as an acute neurologic dysfunction of vascular
origin with sudden or rapid occurrence of symptoms and signs
corresponding to the involvement of focal areas in the brain
(Goldstein et al., 1989). Stroke pharmacokinetics is inﬂuenced by
the morbidity and pathologic complications (Georgilis et al., 1999;
Otegbayo et al., 2006b), far different from the normal state (Stangier
et al., 2010). It is well known that patients afﬂicted with diseases are
the ultimate target of drug development (Zhao et al., 2007). It is
therefore, necessary to study the pharmacokinetics of geniposide in
stroke.
Most herbal medicines prescribed in combination with traditional
Chinese medicine produce a synergistic effect or diminish adverse
reactions (Pei et al., 2009). The biocompatibility may depend on the
composition of other ingredients in vivo (Ung et al., 2007), mediated
by herb–herb interactions. In XNJ, gardenia extract is prescribed with
borneol (Fig. 1B), muscone and Curcuma aromatica volatile oils
(38:18:3:1). The study of other ingredients on the pharmacokinetics
of geniposide will facilitate the evaluation of the compatibility of XNJ
and ensure its clinical safety and efﬁcacy.
Reports showed varying pharmacokinetics of geniposide in
traditional Chinese preparations (Guan et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006;

17.60 mg/mL. To obtain a solution, speciﬁc amounts of geniposide
and gardenia extract were weighed and dissolved in solvent,
respectively. Geniposide and ﬁne borneol powder (proportion by
weight, 9:8) were mixed and added to the solution to obtain
geniposide–borneol suspension. The XNJ suspension was prepared
with gardenia extract, borneol, muscone and Curcuma aromatica
volatile oils (proportion by weight, 38:18:3:1) weighed and mixed
thoroughly.

Sun et al., 2012), depending on their composition and the herb–herb
interactions. Generally, geniposide is poorly absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract in its native form and must be hydrolyzed to
genipin by β-D-glucosidase ﬁrst (Takeda et al., 1980; Akao et al.,
1994). Fortunately, studies indicated that the bioavailability of
geniposide was improved in healthy rats orally administered with
Zhi-Zi-Hou-Pu decoction (Sun et al., 2012). However, the pharmacokinetics of geniposide in disease was seldom reported. Therefore,
the primary objective of this study was to investigate the effects of
stroke on the pharmacokinetics of geniposide. We also investigated
the effects associated with herbal ingredients in XNJ on the
pharmacokinetic behavior of geniposide. We compared the effects
in strokeafter administration of geniposide, gardenia extract, geniposide–borneol compounds and XNJ, and speculated the underlying
mechanisms.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals and reagents
Geniposide was obtained from Ciyuan Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanxi,
China), borneol was purchased from Golden Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd. (Guizhou, China) and muscone was produced by Lianxin
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Gardenia extract and
Curcuma aromatica volatile oils were prepared and puriﬁed by
researchers in our lab, and the voucher specimens were deposited
in Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. Geniposide and Genipin
1-O-beta-D-gentiobioside standards were purchased from the
National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological
Products (Beijing, China) to determine their content in Gardenia
extract. Acetonitrile and methanol were of high HPLC grade
(Merck, Germany). Pure waterwas supplied by Wahaha Group
Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China).
2.2. Gardenia extract
Gardenia extract primarily contained geniposide, genipin 1-Obeta-D-gentiobioside, 6α-hydroxygeniposide and geniposidic acid
(Du et al., 2009). The stability of geniposide content was measured.
The quality control analysis of gardenia extract was accomplished
as follows. Gardenia extract was ultra-sonicated with methanol for
10 min, after dilution 10 times. The solution was then ﬁltered
through 0.2 μm microporous membrane before injection. The
analysis was conducted with acetonitrile-water (13:87) as mobile
phase at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min, and detected at 238 nm. The
content of geniposide in gardenia extract was 50.2%.
2.3. Preparation of oral medicine
We prepared 0.70% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium aqueous
solution as the solvent. The oral dose contained geniposide

Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (240–260 g, Certiﬁcation No.
2013-0001) were obtained from Weitong Biotechnology Inc. (Beijing, China), and fasted for 12 h with free access to water before
drug administration. Animal welfare and experimental procedures
were strictly in accordance with the Regulation for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals (State Science
and Technology Commission, 1988) and approved by Beijing
University of Chinese Medicine Committee on Animal Care
and Use.
Rats were anesthetized with 20% urethane solution. Rats
afﬂicted with stroke were obtained by middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) operation according to the method of Longa
et al. (1989), with minor modiﬁcation. Brieﬂy, following a midline
incision in the neck of each rat, the right common carotid artery
(CCA), the external carotid artery (ECA) and the internal carotid
artery (ICA) were separated. After the ECA and the CCA were
ligated, a 0.26 mm polylysine-coated nylon monoﬁlament (Beijing
Shadong biotechnology Co., Ltd.) was inserted into the MCA
through ICA to maintain a state of ischemia for 2 h. The ﬁlament
was slowly withdrawn and animals returned to their cages. After
22 h of reperfusion, the operated rats were scored and those
manifesting stroke were chosen. The sham-operated rats were
operated similarly but without the inserted ﬁlament. The body
temperature was maintained with an infrared lamp and monitored
for respiration and unresponsiveness continuously throughout the
surgical procedure.
After reperfusion for 22 h following 2-h cerebral ischemia,
the operated rats were observed and graded (Bederson et al.,
1986). Rats with contralateral hemiparesis and Horner0 s syndrome
(1 point), contralateral orbiting (2 points), contralateral tumble
(3 points) and paralysis without consciousness (4 points) were
chosen as stroke rats. The sham-operated rats revived without
unusual behavior.
2.5. Instrumentation and chromatographic conditions
The analysis was performed on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC
system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with
UV detector. Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a
Merck C18 (4.6  250 mm I.D., 5.0 mm) analytical column under the
following conditions: acetonitrile-water (13:87) at a ﬂow rate of
1.0 mL/min; sample injection, 20 μL; column temperature, 25 1C
and detection wavelength, 238 nm.
2.6. Sample preparation
The thawed plasma samples (200 μL) were placed into centrifuge tubes, mixed with 600 μL acetonitrile-methanol (2:3)
mixture (Bruce et al., 2009). The mixture was vortexed for 1 min
and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was
removed and evaporated under air stream in a water bath at
60 1C. The residue was dissolved in 100 μL of methanol and shook
for 30 s, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Finally, 20 μL of
supernatant was injected into the HPLC system for analysis.

2.7. Method validation
Stock solution of geniposide was prepared by dissolving accurately weighed geniposide in methanol to yield a ﬁnal concentration of 1.074 mg/mL. A series of working solutions were obtained
by diluting the stock solution with methanol. For the calibration
curve, 20 μL working solutions were spiked with 200 μL blank
plasma to get the calibration standard samples in the range of
0.1074–10.74 μg/mL. To evaluate accuracy, precision, recovery and
stability, quality control (QC) samples were prepared at low,
medium and high concentrations (0.2685, 1.074, 8.592 μg/mL) for
plasma in the same manner as the calibration standards. Accuracy
was deﬁned as the relative error (RE%) and the precision was
calculated as the relative error (RSD%). The recovery rates (RR%)
were calculated as the ratio of peak area from plasma samples
spiked before extraction and those from plasma samples spiked

after extraction. Stability (at room temperature for 24 h) was
assessed by comparing the concentrations of QC at different time
and the theoretical concentrations.
2.8. In vivo pharmacokinetic study
Both stroke-afﬂicted rats and sham-operated rats were divided
into two groups (n ¼5): XNJ and geniposide subgroups. 24 h after
reperfusion in stroke group i.e. 26 h after operation in shamoperated group, XNJ and geniposide were administered, respectively, at a dose of 176.0 mg/kg of geniposide. 0.5 mL plasma
samples were collected into heparinized tubes from the orbital
vein at the time points of 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240 and
360 min separately, following oral administration. After centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min, plasma samples were stored at
 20 1C and analyzed within 1 week.

We assigned another 10 stroke-afﬂicted rats randomly to
two groups: gardenia extraction and geniposide–borneol groups
(n ¼5). The drugs were administered to rats at a dose of 176.0
mg/kg for geniposide. The administration time, collection time and
blood volume were similar to the group above. After centrifugation, plasma samples were stored at  20 1C and analyzed within
1 week.

2.9. Statistical analysis
The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental methods using Kinetica version 4.4 (Innaphase,
MA, USA). Statistical Comparisons among groups were performed
with SPSS Version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) using the
analysis of variance. All the data were expressed as the mean 7
standard deviation.

3. Results
3.1. HPLC
The HPLC used to determine geniposide in rat plasma was
speciﬁc and efﬁcient. Typical chromatograms of different samples
are presented in Fig. 2. No signiﬁcant endogenous interference of
the analytes was observed.
The calibration curves of geniposide were plotted. They showed
a good linearity between peak area (A) and concentration (C) over
the range of 0.1074–10.71 μg/mL. The regression equation was
A¼ 57.711C þ 1.1508 (r ¼ 0.9999), and the detection limit was
0.05 μg/mL (S/N Z3). The results of precision are listed in
Table 1. The recovery rates of geniposide from rat plasma were
100.0 71.58, 100.0 70.74 and 100.0 7 1.01% at high, medium, and
low concentrations, respectively. The stability of sample storage
was assessed with RE less than 715% for all samples.

The validated HPLC method was successfully applied to the
pharmacokinetic study of geniposide in stroke and sham-operated
rat plasma after oral administration of geniposide and XNJ. The mean
concentration-time curves are shown in Fig. 3. The curves of geniposide in stroke rats administered geniposide, gardenia extraction,
geniposide–borneol and XNJ are plotted in Fig. 4. All pharmacokinetic
parameters were calculated by non-compartmental methods using
Kinetica version 4.4 (Innaphase, MA, USA) and the results are shown
in Table 2.
3.2.1. Pharmacokinetics of geniposide
The curve of rats with stroke, administered with XNJ was apparently high (Fig. 3). The Cmax and AUC0 t in this group were
5.9773.82 μg/mL, and 570.067274.32 μg  min/mL, respectively.
Administering geniposide alone to the rats with stroke decreased
the Cmax and AUC0 t to 1.4870.56 μg/mL and 264.78774.82 μg min/
mL, respectively, indicating the compatibility of XNJ and improved
absorption of geniposide. However, the sham-operated rats failed to
show this phenomenon. The Cmax and AUC0 t, in geniposide and XNJ
group showed similar values of 1.3670.49, 1.7270.29 μg/mL,
262.40791.15, and 291.43781.86 μg min/mL, respectively. We conclude that stroke is a prerequisite of compatibility of XNJ, in vivo.
3.2.2. Pharmacokinetics of geniposide after treatment
As showed in Fig. 4, in the stroke-afﬂicted rats, the level
of geniposide of geniposide–borneol group was similar to
XNJ group with the Cmax and AUC0  t of 4.89 71.88 μg/mL,
573.13 7244.73 μg min/mL. However, no signiﬁcant difference of
Cmax and AUC0  t occurred between the gardenia extract group and
geniposide group. The Cmax and AUC0  t in the group containing
borneol were signiﬁcantly higher than the group given geniposide
or gardenia extract alone (P o0.05). The results suggested that
borneol, rather than the other components in gardenia extract, is
necessary to improve the absorption of geniposide in XNJ preparation in rats afﬂicted with stroke.

4. Discussions
4.1. Reproduction of stroke and sham-operated rats
In this study, we selected the middle cerebral artery occlusion
model to simulate the abnormal state of stroke. The transient focal
ischemia model is associated with minimal harm and has
been used widely in scientiﬁc research (Truong et al., 2012).

A sham-operated control group was included to diminish the
probable inﬂuence of operation on pharmacokinetics.
4.2. Dose determination
A previous pharmacological study (Yang et al., 2012) reported
that the XNJ oral preparation reduced neurological deﬁcits effectively, at lower doses in a dose-dependent fashion. Our study
increased the prescription dose to determine geniposide levels in
plasma. However, due to the risk of toxicity associated with
geniposide and the other components in (Hou et al., 2008;
Li et al., 2011), we sought to determine the safe and effective
dosage in rats with stroke.
4.3. Pharmacokinetic study
Stroke causes hemorrhage of upper gastrointestinal tract, and
increased drug permeability through the disrupted gastric mucosal barrier (Otegbayo et al., 2006a). Fever also appears with stroke
(Greer et al., 2008), with the high temperature increasing blood
ﬂow and binding of plasma protein with drugs. The physical
changes improve the absorption of geniposide after administration
of XNJ. However, the pharmacokinetic features of geniposide were
similar in normal and stroke-afﬂicted rats. It suggested that stroke
does not increase the bioavailability of geniposide in XNJ. Other
factors in XNJ may play a role.
The herbal ingredients of XNJ include both water-soluble and
lipid-soluble constituents. The water-soluble constituents are
derived from gardenia extract. The other three herbs contain
lipid-soluble constituents. Gardenia and borneol account for most
of XNJ. Our study therefore, compared the gardenia extract and
geniposide–borneol groups with geniposide and XNJ groups to
determine the ingredients contributing to the bioavailability of
geniposide. The results indicated that borneol played an important
role in improving absorption of geniposide in stroke after administration of XNJ, which was consistent with previous ﬁndings (Xiao
et al., 2001; Thomas and Smriti, 2003). Borneol is a monoterpenoid
passing through the gastric mucosa easily. It may increase the
mobility and permeability of cell membrane or affect the expression
of carrier protein (Li et al., 2006) to promote drug absorption. The
other components of gardenia extract, which are poorly absorbed
have little inﬂuence on the pharmacokinetics of geniposide.

5. Conclusions
Comparative pharmacokinetics of geniposide in stroke and
sham-operated rats indicated that stroke status was a prerequisite
for increased bioavailability of geniposide in XNJ. Our study, which
focused on the herb–herb interactions in stroke showed that

borneol is the main component that improves the absorption of
geniposide in XNJ. In summary, the bioavailability of geniposide in
XNJ increased signiﬁcantly, with both stroke status and borneol
availability. Our research into the different factors inﬂuencing
pharmacokinetics of geniposide in traditional Chinese preparation
proved the rationale of XNJ compatibility and the use of XNJ in the
treatment of stroke. The knowledge can be used to evaluate the
clinical efﬁcacy and safety of geniposide treatment.
