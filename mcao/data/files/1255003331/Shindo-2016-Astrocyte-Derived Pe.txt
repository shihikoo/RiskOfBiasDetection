Background and Purpose—Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is released on inflammatory responses in many organs. However, roles
of PTX3 in brain are still mostly unknown. Here we asked whether and how PTX3 contributes to blood–brain barrier
dysfunction during the acute phase of ischemic stroke.
Methods—In vivo, spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to focal cerebral ischemia by transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion. At day 3, brains were analyzed to evaluate the cellular origin of PTX3 expression. Correlations with
blood–brain barrier breakdown were assessed by IgG staining. In vitro, rat primary astrocytes and rat brain endothelial
RBE.4 cells were cultured to study the role of astrocyte-derived PTX3 on vascular endothelial growth factor–mediated
endothelial permeability.
Results—During the acute phase of stroke, reactive astrocytes in the peri-infarct area expressed PTX3. There was negative
correlation between gradients of IgG leakage and PTX3-positive astrocytes. Cell culture experiments showed that
astrocyte-conditioned media increased levels of tight junction proteins and reduced endothelial permeability under
normal conditions. Removing PTX3 from astrocyte-conditioned media by immunoprecipitation increased endothelial
permeability. PTX3 strongly bound vascular endothelial growth factor in vitro and was able to decrease vascular
endothelial growth factor–induced endothelial permeability.
Conclusions—Astrocytes in peri-infarct areas upregulate PTX3, which may support blood–brain barrier integrity by
regulating vascular endothelial growth factor–related mechanisms. This response in astrocytes may comprise a
compensatory mechanism for maintaining blood–brain barrier function after ischemic stroke.

lood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage contributes significantly to the progression of secondary brain injury after
ischemic stroke.1 Although the primary substrate of BBB
injury may involve dysfunction in tight junction proteins
within the affected endothelium, emerging data now suggest
that gliovascular interactions may also be important. Under
baseline conditions, astrocytes provide trophic support to
cerebral endothelial cells to maintain BBB homeostasis.2
However, under ischemic conditions, trophic support from
astrocytes may be disrupted and furthermore, reactive/diseased astrocytes may even produce deleterious factors that
worsen BBB breakdown.3,4
Although reactive astrocytes often exert deleterious
effects on neighboring cells under pathological conditions,

they may also protect brain function or promote brain
remodeling after brain injury.5,6 In this study, we test our
hypothesis that reactive astrocytes may secrete mediators
that support BBB function after ischemic stroke. Because
one such potential mediator secreted by reactive astrocytes
that benefit cerebral endothelial cells, we investigated the
roles of pentraxin 3 (PTX3) on BBB integrity. PTX3 is a
prototypical member of the long pentraxin family, and it
is upregulated in several cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.7–9 Therefore, in this study, we first determined
whether reactive astrocytes expressed PTX3 after acute
ischemic stroke in vivo. Then, primary cell culture experiments were conducted to assess how astrocyte-derived
PTX3 may regulate BBB integrity in vitro.

Ten 3-month-old spontaneous hypertensive male rats (Charles River
Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used. Rats were anesthetized
with isoflurane in 70% N2O and 30% O2 mixture. Rectal temperature was maintained between 36.5°C and 37.5°C with a heating pad. Five rats underwent 75-minute transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) by intraluminal filament with ligation of
external carotid artery. Five rats underwent 75-minute anesthesia
with only ligation of external carotid artery (sham-operated group).
Three days after MCAO or sham-operation, rats were deeply anesthetized and perfused with ice-cold saline. Brains were removed
and snap frozen. Coronal sections of 20-μm thickness were cut on
cryostat (Microm HM505E) at −20°C and collected on the slides
and stored at −80°C.

10 000g for 5 minutes to remove cells and debris. Control media
was prepared from culture wells without astrocytes. Astrocyteconditioned media were stored at −80°C until use. For media transfer
experiments, astrocyte-conditioned media and control media were
diluted with endothelial basal medium-2 at the ratio of 1:1.

Immunoprecipitation
According to the manufacture’s instruction, anti-rabbit PTX3 antibody (Enzo) and Dynabeads Protein G Immunoprecipitation kit (Life
technologies) were used to precipitate PTX3 in culture media.

In Vitro Endothelial Permeability Assay
RBE.4 monolayer was prepared on collagen-I–coated transwells (6.5mm diameter, 3.0-μm pore size polycarbonate filter, Corning). When
RBE.4 became confluent on the transwell, cells were treated with astrocyte-conditioned media or control media for 24 hours. Then, fluorescein
isothiocyanate–labeled dextran (molecular weight, 40 000; Sigma) was
added to the upper chamber. After 60-minute incubation, 100 μL of culture media from the lower compartment was corrected and measured
for fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm and emission, 516 nm) with a
spectrophotometer.

Cell Proliferation Assay
Cells were incubated with 10% water soluble tetrazolium solution for
1 hour at 37°C, and then the absorbance of the culture medium was

Immunohistochemistry and IgG Staining
Brain sections were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde and rinsed with
PBS. After blocking with 3% BSA, sections were incubated at 4°C
overnight in PBS/0.1% Tween solution containing primary antibodies; anti-PTX3 (1:100, Enzo), anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) (astrocyte marker, 1:100, BD Pharm), anti-NeuN (neuron
marker, 1:100, Chemicon), anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (oligodendrocyte progenitor cell marker, 1:100, Santa Cruz),
anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (pericyte marker, 1:100,
R&D systems), anti-nestin (NSC marker, 1:100, abcam), anti–zonula
occludens-1 (ZO-1, 1:100, Invitrogen), and anti-VEGF (1:100,
Santa Cruz). For IgG staining, sections were incubated overnight
at 4°C with antibody against donkey anti-Rat IgG (1:300, Jackson
Immunoresearch Laboratories). Then sections were washed and
incubated with secondary antibodies with fluorescence conjugations
at room temperature for 1 hour. Immunostaining was analyzed with
fluorescence microscope (Nikon) interfaced with a digital charge–
coupled device camera and an image analysis system. After staining
with anti-PTX3 and anti-GFAP antibody and secondary antibodies,
MCAO-operated brain section was analyzed on 5 Pascal LSM scanning confocal microscope (Care Zeiss, Germany). Each staining area
of PTX3 of peri-infarct area after MCAO was analyzed by quantifying mean intensity, and the staining areas of PTX3, GFAP, IgG, and
ZO-1 were analyzed by quantifying mean intensity of divided periinfarct area with a space of 0.2 mm from the core edge for 3 brain
sections of each rats, using ImageJ analysis software.

Cell Culture
Rat brain microendothelial cell line RBE.4 cells were maintained in
endothelial basal medium-2 (EBM-2) supplemented with EGM-2MV
SingleQuots kit (Lonza). Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared
from cerebral cortices of 1- to 2-day-old neonatal Sprague–Dawley
rats and maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum
according to our previous work.10,11

Preparation of Astrocyte-Conditioned Media
Cultured astrocytes were washed with PBS and maintained in DMEM
for 24 hours. Culture medium was then collected and centrifuged at

software.

Cell Death Assay
Cytotoxicity was quantified by a standard measurement of lactate
dehydrogenase using lactate dehydrogenase assay kit (Roche).

Western Blot
Brain samples of ipsilateral hemisphere from MCAO and shamoperated rats (n=5 each) were homogenized in Pro-PREP Protein
Extraction solution (Boca scientific). Cell cultures rinsed twice
with ice-cold PBS and then collected into the Pro-PREP. Astrocyteconditioned media were concentrated 10× by using Vivaspin 500
centrifugal concentrator (Vivaproducts). Immunoprecipitation beads
were processed according to the manufacturer’s instruction for
Western blot analysis. Western blot samples were mixed with equal
volumes of SDS (Novex) sample buffer containing 10% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Each sample was loaded into 4% to 20%
tris-glycine gels (Novex). After electrophoresis and transferring to
nitrocellulose membranes (Novex), the membranes were blocked in
I block (Tropix) for 60 minutes and then incubated overnight at 4°C
with primary antibodies with ZO-1 (1:1000), claudin 5 (1:500, Santa
Cruz), PTX3 (1:1000), VEGF (1:500, Santa Cruz), or β-actin (1:5000,

Statistical Analysis
Results were expressed as mean±SD Statistical significance was evaluated using Mann–Whitney U test to compare between 2 groups and
Kruskal–Wallis test for multiple comparisons. A P value of <0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.

Results
First, we examined the expression of PTX3 during the acute
phase of stroke in vivo. Brain samples from spontaneously
hypertensive rats with 75-minute MCAO followed by 3-day
reperfusion were subjected to Western blot analysis. PTX3
expression level significantly increased in the MCAO group
compared with the sham-operated group (Figure 1A and 1B).
Then, we conducted immunohistochemistry to identify which
cell type(s) expressed PTX3 using cell-specific antibodies
such as NeuN for neuron, GFAP for astrocyte, platelet-derived
growth factor receptor α for oligodendrocyte progenitor cell,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor β for pericyte, and

astrocyte-conditioned media (ACM) contain PTX3. Importantly,
after ACM was filtered with anti-PTX3 antibody (ACMPTX3-), level
of PTX3 in ACM became low. B, Normal ACM decreased the
permeability (ie, enhanced the in vitro blood–brain barrier [BBB]
tightness), but PTX3-deficient ACM (ACMPTX3-) did not support

nestin for NSPC. We found that the majority of PTX3-positive
cells (87.8±3.7%) was coimmunostained with GFAP in the
peri-infarct area (Figure 1C), consistent with an astrocytic cellular origin. Furthermore, the confocal microscopic observation confirmed that the GFAP-positive cells exhibited stellate
appearance, which is generally thought as a typical morphology of reactive astrocytes (Figure 1D).
We next focused on the distribution of PTX3 in the periinfarct area (≈0.8 mm from the core edge). Within that region,
GFAP-positive cells were uniformly distributed (Figure I in
the online-only Data Supplement). However, IgG staining
indicative of BBB leakage was mainly observed in the periinfarct areas close to the edge of the infarct core, whereas
PTX3 was strongly immunostained in the peri-infarct areas
farthest away from the edge of the infarct core (Figure
2A–2C). The level of PTX3 expression exhibited significant
negative correlation with the IgG leakage in the peri-infarct
area (Figure 2D), raising the possibility that astrocytic PTX3
may be involved in the regulation of BBB permeability during acute stroke in vivo.
To further examine how astrocyte-derived PTX3 may
regulate BBB function, we conducted in vitro cell culture
experiments using primary rat astrocytes and RBE.4 rat brain
endothelial cells. Western blots of astrocyte-conditioned
media (ACM) confirmed that cultured astrocytes secreted
PTX3 (Figure 3A; left lane). To investigate the role of astrocyte-derived PTX3 in the context of BBB permeability, we
measured endothelial permeability in a standard transwell system, either in the presence of normal ACM or PTX3-depleted
ACM (ACMPTX3- obtained by filtering ACM with anti-PTX3
antibody—Figure 3A; right lane). As expected, normal ACM
decreased endothelial permeability (ie, astrocytes enhanced
the endothelial tightness in vitro; Figure 3B). But the PTX3depleted ACM PTX3- did not enhance endothelial tightness
(Figure 3B). Notably, ACM-derived PTX3 was also supportive for in vitro BBB tightness under pathological conditions
(Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). These effects

of PTX3 might be attributed to paracellular mechanisms
because ACM containing PTX3 significantly increased the
expression levels of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin
5, whereas PTX3-depleted ACM did not (Figure 4A–4C).
To confirm the direct endothelial barrier-tightening effect
of PTX3, we added recombinant PTX3 to brain endothelial
cells and examined the permeability and expression levels of
ZO-1 and claudin 5. Exogenous PTX3 significantly enhanced
endothelial barrier tightness along with increasing expression of ZO-1 and claudin 5 (Figure 5A–5D). Water soluble
tetrazolium and lactate dehydrogenase assays confirmed that
PTX3 did not affect the cell number and cell viability in the
cultured endothelial layers (Figure III in the online-only Data
Supplement). These in vitro findings were supported by our
in vivo data, demonstrating that ZO-1 expression pattern was
mildly correlated with PTX3 expression in the peri-infarcted
region (Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement).
PTX3 is known to bind to VEGF,12 which is a key regulator of endothelial leakage during stroke. Therefore, we asked
whether BBB-protecting effects of PTX3 may also involve
VEGF in our model systems. Indeed, in our in vivo rat stroke
model, VEGF expression increased after ischemia and reactive
astrocytes indeed produced both VEGF and PTX3 (Figure V in
the online-only Data Supplement). Immunoprecipitation assays

confirmed that recombinant PTX3 directly bound to VEGF in
cell-free conditions (Figure 6A). Similarly, we confirmed that
astrocyte-derived PTX3 bound to VEGF in the conditioned
media from astrocyte cultures (Figure 6B). Finally, exogenous
PTX3 suppressed the VEGF-mediated increase in cerebral
endothelial cell permeability in vitro (Figure 6C), suggesting
that PTX3 may negatively regulate VEGF actions on BBB permeability by directly binding and capturing VEGF.

Discussion
In this study, we described a novel role of astrocytes in supporting BBB integrity during the acute phase of ischemic
stroke. Within the neurovascular unit, astrocytes are the major
cell type to maintain cerebrovascular homeostasis. In the
brain, astrocytes enfold blood vessels with multiple endfeet13
and release several trophic factors that support BBB function
under normal conditions.14 For example, astrocyte-derived
glial-derived neurotrophic factor enhances the barrier function
of BBB.15 On the other hand, after brain injury, reactive astrocytes secrete deleterious factors, such as VEGF, that cause
BBB breakdown.16 However, recent studies suggest that reactive astrocytes may also contribute to BBB protection under
pathological conditions.17,18 Our current study supports the
idea that reactive astrocytes may have beneficial actions after
ischemic stroke, that is, astrocyte-derived PTX3 protects BBB
integrity during ischemic conditions (Figure 6D).
The pentraxins belong to a superfamily of multifunctional
proteins19 with conserved phylogeny. They are divided into
2 groups based on their primary structure: short and long
pentraxin.20 PTX3 belongs to a long pentraxin family and is
upregulated by inflammatory stress. Thus far, several kinds of
cell types are confirmed to produce PTX3—vascular endothelial cells,21,22 vascular smooth muscle cells,23 and monocytes/
macrophages.24,25 Recent cell culture studies also showed
that neurons and mixed glial cells may secrete PTX3 after

interleukin-1α/β (IL-1α/β) stimulation.26 Those inflammationinduced PTX3 may have protective roles because PTX3 can
reduce acute myocardial infarction,27 lung injury,28 and acute
kidney injury.29 Furthermore, PTX3 knockout mice exhibited
severe edema formation and glial scar formation under ischemic conditions.26 Our findings filled the gap of knowledge of
PTX3 roles in stroke conditions—(1) reactive astrocytes are
the major cell type for PTX3 production in the peri-infarct
area, (2) astrocytic PTX3 may support BBB integrity, and (3)
PTX3 increases expression levels of tight junction proteins in
cerebral endothelial cells. Therefore, these results may provide an important insight for a compensatory response of reactive astrocytes after brain injury.
Another important finding of our current study is that PTX3
may support BBB integrity in both direct and indirect ways.
Under stroke conditions, several deleterious factors, such as
VEGF, are released to cause BBB dysfunction. As one of the
early events after central nervous system injury and inflammation, VEGF breaks down BBB integrity by downregulating
protein and mRNA levels of claudin 5 and occludin, which
are important components of the BBB.30 Our findings may
arouse the novel concept that PTX3 counteracts the negative
effects of VEGF on the BBB. Importantly, Rusnati et al12 previously demonstrated that PTX3 has high affinity to fibroblast
growth factor (FGF) 2 and blocks FGF2-induced angiogenesis in vitro. The same study showed that PTX3 has low or no
affinities to a panel of cytokines and growth factors, including
FGF-1, nerve growth factor, or IL-1. But interestingly, PTX3
exhibited an affinity to VEGF to some extent, which supports
our idea that PTX3 interacts with VEGF and supports the
BBB integrity during the acute phase of stroke. However, our
current study only demonstrated the interaction of PTX3 with
VEGF. To understand the roles of PTX3 in ischemic brains
more precisely, we may need to carefully examine whether
PTX3 interacts with other BBB-damaging factors in future
studies.

Although our findings describe a novel role of astrocytic
PTX3 in cerebral ischemia, we need to note a few caveats
and limitations in this proof-of-concept study. First, PTX3
expression pattern in peri-infarct area was negatively correlated to the IgG leakage (ie, BBB damage) in our stroke rats.
But strictly speaking, we have not provided a direct proof
that astrocytic PTX3 protects BBB against ischemic stress
in vivo. Future studies may require gain and loss-of-function
studies of PTX3 in astrocytes in vivo to confirm our in vitro
findings that astrocyte-derived PTX3 increases tight junction
protein expressions and decreases the endothelial permeability. Second, not all the reactive astrocytes expressed PTX3
in the peri-infarct area; consistent with the well-known heterogeneous nature of astrocytes. Which factors or signaling
pathways regulate PTX3 expression in reactive astrocytes
would be an important research topic in future. Third, reactive
astrocytes are one of the major cell types for PTX3 production in brain parenchyma, but as mentioned above, circulating
cells such as monocytes and macrophages also secrete PTX3.
How circulating cell-derived PTX3 contribute to cerebrovascular function under ischemic stroke is an important area of
future investigations. Fourth, our cell culture experiments
described an important role of PTX3 on paracellular pathway
of BBB breakdown, but after stroke, transcellular pathways
may also be important.31 Whether and how PTX3 contributes
to the transcellular pathway of BBB should also be examined
in future to understand the roles of PTX3 on cerebrovascular function more carefully. Finally, our current study focused
only on the acute phase of stroke. Although VEGF (or other
BBB-damaging factors) is deleterious during the acute phase
of stroke, it is beneficial during the chronic phase because it
promotes brain remodeling.32 Because PTX3 inhibited VEGF
effects in endothelial cultures, it is possible that astrocytic
PTX3 would, in turn, inhibit brain repair, especially compensatory angiogenesis, after stroke. In fact, past studies demonstrate that PTX3 inhibits in vitro angiogenesis by FGF2

or FGF8 treatment.12,33,34 Therefore, the effects and dynamic
roles of PTX3 on angiogenesis should be carefully assessed to
further delineate the therapeutic potential of PTX3 for stroke
or other cerebrovascular diseases.
In summary, our present study demonstrates that PTX3 is
an important mediator from reactive astrocytes that acts on
cerebral endothelial cells and supports BBB integrity after
ischemic stroke. This finding reveals a novel role of reactive
astrocytes under pathological conditions and suggests that
astrocytic PTX3 may be an effective therapeutic target for
acute ischemic stroke.

Supplementary Figure II: Astrocytic PTX3 protected in vitro BBB integrity against hypoxic stress.
Brain endothelial RBE.4 cells were treated with control media, ACM, or PTX3-depleted ACM. After that,
cells were subjected to 6-hr hypoxia, and then the in vitro endothelial permeability assay was conducted.
Hypoxic stress increased the in vitro endothelial permeability (i.e. breakdown in vitro BBB tightness), but
ACM protected the tightness. However, PTX3-depleted ACM was not supportive for cerebral endothelial
cells. Data are represented mean ± SD from n=4. *P<0.05. n.s. stands for “not significant”.
