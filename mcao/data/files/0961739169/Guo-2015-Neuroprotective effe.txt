Sodium danshensu (SDSS), the sodium salt of danshensu (DSS), has the same pharmacological effects as DSS. In
the present study, we aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect and possible mechanism of SDSS against
cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham,
control, 30 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg SDSS. Cerebral ischemia was induced by 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). Neurological functional deﬁcits were evaluated according to the modiﬁed neurological severity score
(mNSS); cerebral infarct volume and histological damage were measured by TTC or H–E staining. In addition,
the number of apoptotic cells and caspase 3/7 activity were assessed by TUNEL or Caspase-Glo assay. And the
expression of apoptosis-regulatory proteins and the PI3K/Akt pathway were investigated by western blotting.
Our results showed that treatment with SDSS for 5 days after MCAO remarkably improved neurologic deﬁcits
and survival rate, reduced infarct volume and the number of dead neurons. SDSS also decreased the number
of apoptotic cells, regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax, and increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. Further
study revealed that treatment with SDSS also increased the level of p-Akt and p-GSK-3β . Taken together,
our results suggest that SDSS has the neuroprotective effect against cerebral I/R injury, and the potential
mechanism might to inhibition of apoptosis through activating the PI3K/Akt signal pathway.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke results from occlusion of cerebral vasculature,
which is one of the leading causes of death and the principal causes
of disability in the world (Chacon et al. 2008). Ineffective therapies
result in the number of poor prognosis in stroke patients. Thus, many
studies for ischemic stroke have been established in order to understand the pathophysiology and achieve a better therapy. In recent
years, apoptosis has attracted a close attention in cerebral ischemia
and reperfusion injury (Liu et al. 2013), and exploring anti-apoptotic
agents is a novel therapeutic opportunity for ischemic stroke.
Salvia miltiorrhiza bunge, generally known as danshen, is an important and widely used medicinal plant in traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM) (Yeung 2013; Chen et al. 2014). It is used in many countries,
including China, Korea and Japan (Wu and Wang 2012). According

to the principles of TCM, the dried root of S. miltiorrhiza can be used
for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as angina pectoris,
myocardial infarction and arteriosclerosis (Fan et al. 2009; Ren et al.
2010). Especially, Danshensu (DSS), a water soluble phenolic acids
component of Danshen, has multiple pharmacological effects including relaxation of coronary artery, anticoagulation, protection of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, and anti-arrhythmia activities
(Lam et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2010; Yin et al. 2013).
In addition, some original studies also showed that DSS provided
neuronal protection in the neurotoxin-treated model and could pass
the blood–brain barrier in the rat, suggesting that DSS has protective potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders (Yu
et al. 2011; Chong et al. 2013). These ﬁndings inspired us to speculate
that DSS should also have neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia
and reperfusion injury. However, DSS is unstable in nature (Liu et al.
2011); it was usually transformed into its sodium salt, sodium danshensu (SDSS). The chemical structures of DSS and SDSS are shown in
Fig. 1. SDSS has the same effectiveness as DSS.
In order to verify our speculation, the present study was designed
to investigate the neuroprotective effect and possible mechanism

additional rats. Arterial blood samples were taken before ischemia
(baseline), during ischemia and after ischemia for gases and plasma
glucose measurements.
Neurological deﬁcits test

Neurological deﬁcits were evaluated by a blinded observer on
days 1, 3, and 5 after MCAO with the modiﬁed neurological severity score (mNSS) (Chen et al. 2001). The mNSS is a composite of motor
(muscle status and abnormal movement), sensory (visual, tactile, and
proprioceptive), reﬂex, and balance tests. Neurological function was
graded on a scale of 0–18 (normal score: 0; maximal deﬁcit score:
18). Higher scores indicate more severe neurological deﬁcits.

of SDSS, by using an animal model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
injury.
Materials and methods
Materials
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–280 g) were obtained from
the Experimental Animal Center of the Fourth Military Medical University (Xi’an, China). Rats were housed at a room temperature of
23 ± 2 °C with a 12/12 h light-dark cycle, and had free access to food
and water. The protocol of this research project complied with the
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals of the Fourth
Military Medical University.
Chemically pure SDSS was obtained from Xi’an Honson Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Xi’an, China). It was identiﬁed on the basis of chemical
and spectroscopic evidence (Fig. 2).
Experimental protocol
Rats were divided randomly into 4 groups: (I) sham-operated
group; (II) control group; (III) 30 mg/kg SDSS-treated group;
(IV) 60 mg/kg SDSS-treated group. SDSS was dissolved in 2 ml water
for injection and the volume of administration was 2 ml/kg. At the
onset of reperfusion, rats were ﬁrst given water or SDSS by intravenous injection, and then the same dose were performed every 24 h
for 5 days.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model

After the last neurological deﬁcits test, rats were decapitated and
the brains were rapidly removed. Infarct volumes were measured as
described previously (Yuan et al. 2011). Brieﬂy, brains were sliced into
uniform coronal sections of approximately 2 mm thickness each and
the brain slices were stained 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) at 37 °C for 5–10 min. The TTC-stained sections were photographed with a digital camera and the infarct areas of each section
were measured using an image analysis system. To compensate for
the effect of brain edema, the corrected infarct volume was calculated as the following equation. Infarct volumes were expressed as
percentages of contralateral hemispheric volumes.

Histological evaluation
For evaluation of histological damage, rats were deeply anesthetized on day 5 after MCAO by perfusion with physiological saline
solution, followed by freshly prepared 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in
0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4). Brain was removed and postﬁxed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Then
the brain block was embedded in paraﬃn and cut into 5 μm coronal
sections. The sections were stained with hematoxylin–eosin (H–E)
using standard methods. With respect to HE staining, viable neurons were deﬁned as neurons in which a clear nucleus could be seen,
and ischemic damaged neurons exhibited features including pyknosis
and shrunken cell bodies. The total number of viable neurons in the
ischemic cortex was counted in a blind manner by light microscopy
at ×400 magniﬁcation (BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) in each section.
Data from six rats at each group were averaged.
TUNEL staining and quantiﬁcation of apoptosis

Rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (3 ml/kg, I.P.) and
subjected to MCAO as previously described (Guo et al. 2012). In brief,
the right common carotid artery, the external carotid artery (ECA) and
the internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed and carefully isolated.
A 3-0 monoﬁlament nylon suture (Beijing Cinontech Co. Ltd, China)
was inserted from the lumen of the ECA to that of the right ICA to occlude the origin of the right middle cerebral artery. After 2 h of MCAO,
the suture was removed to restore blood ﬂow. Sham-operated rats
were manipulated in the same surgical procedure except that the suture was not inserted into the ICA. Regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF)
was monitored by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (PeriFluxsystem 5000;
Perimed AB, Stockholm, Sweden) with the use of a ﬂexible probe over
the skull as described earlier. Rats that did not show a CBF reduction
of at least 70% were excluded from subsequent experiments. Cranial
temperature was maintained at maintained at 36.8–37.5 °C with a
heating pad. Some physiologic parameters including cranial temperature, arterial pH, PaCO2 , PaO2 and glucose were measured in six

Specimens were processed as described above and apoptotic cells
were detected by TUNEL. Fragmented DNA in cell nuclei was labeled using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science,
Mannheim, Germany) according to manufacturer instructions. The
5 μm coronal sections were stained by TUNEL and a neuron with a
nucleus stained dark brown was considered a positive cell. The total
number of TUNEL-positive cells in the ischemic cortex were counted
in a blind manner by light microscopy at ×400 magniﬁcation (BX51;
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and data from six rats at each group were
averaged.
Caspase-3/7 activity assay
Caspase-3/7 activity of the ischemic cortex was measured using a
Caspase-Glo assay kit (Promega Corporation) according to the manufacturer’s protocol as described previously (Matayoshi et al. 2009).

The values were expressed as percent of those values obtained in the
sham-operated group.
Western blot analysis
For western blot analysis, rats were sacriﬁced on day 5 after MCAO.
Brains were removed and the ischemic cortex was isolated. The tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors.
Then the homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm/s for 10 min and
the supernatant was collected to estimate the protein content by the
BCA protein assay kit (Millipore Corporation). Aliquots of protein/lane
were separated by electrophoresis on a 4–15% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v)
milk and incubated overnight with antibodies against Bax, Bcl-2, pAkt (Ser473), Akt, p-GSK-3β (Ser9) and GSK-3β . Membranes were
then incubated with secondary antibody for 45 min at 37 °C. The
protein bands were detected by the standard chemical luminescence
method (ECL Kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Image analysis was accomplished with the assistance of computerized
analysis software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Protein concentration was analyzed densitometrically and corrected with values
determined on anti-GAPDH blots. The density of proteins was expressed as relative values.

Fig. 3. Regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) was monitored 10 min before ischemia
(baseline), at 10, 60, 110 min during ischemia and 5 min after ischemia. The rCBF
monitoring demonstrated if the MCAO model was successful.

Statistical analysis
SPSS 18.0 software was applied to analyze experimental data, and
results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (S.D.). Statistical
differences among the groups were compared using one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test;
survival rates were analyzed by Kaplan–Meier method. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

The changes of physiologic parameters were shown in Table 1.
There was no statistical signiﬁcance among different time points
for any of the physiologic parameters. These physiologic parameters were all within the normal range in the experimental process. As
shown in Fig. 3, there was no signiﬁcant difference in rCBF between
the control and SDSS-treated group at the corresponding time points.
Monitoring of rCBF demonstrated successful MCAO.

Discussion
In the current study, we demonstrated that SDSS has neuroprotection effect on cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury following
in a rat MCAO model, as it improved neurologic deﬁcits and survival,
reduced infarct volume and increased the number of viable neurons
on day 5 after MCAO. Our date also demonstrated that SDSS inhibits
apoptosis by decreasing the number of apoptotic cells, regulating the
expression of Bcl-2 and Bax, and attenuating caspase-3/7 activity.
In addition, our results also showed that PI3K/Akt signal pathway is
involved in the protective mechanism of SDSS against cerebral I/R
injury.
DSS, 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-hydroxypropanoic acid, has been
reported to be the major monomer phenolic acid of Danshen, also an
effective component in Danshen preparations such as Danhong injection, Danshen injection, Danshen Pill and Danshen tablets (Gu et al.
2014). It has been demonstrated that DSS is an excellent candidate
for removing blood stasis, improving microcirculation and preventing
platelet from adhesion and aggregation (Lu et al. 2014). In addition,
single or repeated dose toxicity studies suggested that DSS does not
cause any signs of toxicity (Gao et al. 2009). Because DSS is unstable in
nature, we take SDSS as the object of research. In this study, we have
also demonstrated that SDSS can produce neuroprotection effect on
cerebral I/R injury by multiple dosing method in vivo experiment. The
protective effect of SDSS at 60 mg/kg was more potent than that at
30 mg/kg, showing a dose response tendency.
Apoptosis is proved to play a role in neuronal death in cerebral
ischemia injury (Broughton et al. 2009). Cerebral ischemia can induce
the expression of apoptotic regulatory genes, such as Bax and Bcl-2.
Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein; it can prevent cytochrome C from
releasing into the cytoplasm, which is a vital step in the apoptotic
process (Wallgren et al. 2013). Bax is a proapoptotic protein that has
signiﬁcant sequence homology with Bcl-2, and activated Bax accelerates programmed cell death (Qin et al. 2008). Bcl-2 and Bax regulate
apoptosis by forming homodimers and heterodimers. Excessive expression of Bax leads to the formation of homodimers and the induction of apoptosis. In contrast, excessive expression of Bcl-2 leads to
the formation of heterodimers that inhibit the apoptosis induced by
Bax homodimers (Liu et al. 2013; Liang et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014).
Thus, the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax regulates apoptotic cell death in response
to cerebral ischemia injury (Salakou et al. 2007). The caspases, especially caspase-3/7 activity, are known to play a central role in the
execution of apoptosis (Benchoua et al. 2001). In this study, apoptotic
events were revealed by TUNEL staining and caspase-3/7 activity as
well as the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. Our results suggested that treatment
with SDSS, the upregulation of Bax after ischemia injury was inhibited, while Bcl-2 was enhanced. This ﬁnding is consistent with the
decreased caspase-3/7 activity and apoptotic neuronal cell counting
results. These ﬁndings indicated that anti-apoptotic effect of SDSS
may be one of the mechanisms by which SDSS improved cerebral I/R
injury.
It has been reported that activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway could suppress apoptosis and protect the brain against I/R injury
(Sun et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2013). Akt, a serine-threonine protein
kinase, is a key molecule in PI3K/Akt pathway and controls survival
and apoptosis and Akt inhibits apoptosis after being phosphorylated
(Fukunaga and Kawano 2003). Phosphorylation of Akt promotes cell
survival against cerebral ischemic injury by phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of many proapoptotic proteins, such as glycogen
synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β ), procaspase-9, and forehead transcription factor (FKHR) (Hanada et al. 2004; Endo et al. 2006). GSK-3β ,
which is highly expressed in the central nervous system, is the key
downstream target of the PI3K/Akt pathway. In general, the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9 negatively regulates proapoptotic activity
(Jope and Johnson 2004) and plays an important role in neurode-

generation. Therefore we also tested the effects of GSK-3β following
SDSS administration. We observed in the present study that SDSS administration remarkably increased p-Akt and p-GSK-3β levels when
compared with the control group. It suggested that PI3K/Akt signal
pathway may be involved in the neuroprotective effect of SDSS against
cerebral I/R injury. We should use the inhibitor of PI3K/Akt to further
demonstrate the involvement of this pathway in the neuroprotective effects of SDSS. However, it was unsuccessful that the PI3K/Akt
pathway was not inhibited by single administration of wortmannin
before MCAO. Next stage, we plan to demonstrate the involvement
of PI3K/Akt pathway in the neuroprotective effect of SDSS by RNA
interference method in vitro.
In conclusion, our study proved for the ﬁrst time that SDSS has a
signiﬁcant protective effect on cerebral I/R injury. Moreover, the neuroprotective effect of SDSS may be partly related with the activation
of the PI3K/Akt signal pathway. These results will provide a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms of neuro protection of
SDSS and help to promote the design of improved neuroprotective
agents for use in stroke.
