Abstract We have previously shown that electroacupuncture
(EA) pretreatment produces neuroprotective effects, which
were mediated through an endocannabinoid signal transduction mechanism. Herein, we have studied the possible contribution of the phosphorylated form of glycogen synthase
kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in EA pretreatment-induced neuroprotection via the cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R). Focal
transient cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral
artery occlusion in rats. Phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9
[p-GSK-3β (Ser-9)] was evaluated in the penumbra tissue
following reperfusion. Infarct size and neurological score
were assessed in the presence of either PI3K inhibitors or a
GSK-3β inhibitor 72 h after reperfusion. Cellular apoptosis
was evidenced by TUNEL staining and determination of the
Bax/Bcl-2 ratio 24 h after reperfusion. The present study
showed that EA pretreatment increased p-GSK-3β(Ser-9)

2 h after reperfusion in the ipsilateral penumbra. Augmented
phosphorylation of GSK-3β induced similar neuroprotective
effects as did EA pretreatment. By contrast, inhibition of PI3K
dampened the levels of p-GSK-3β(Ser-9), and reversed not
only the neuroprotective effect but also the anti-apoptotic
effect following EA pretreatment. Regulation of GSK-3β by
EA pretreatment was abolished following treatment with a
CB1R antagonist and CB1R knockdown, whereas two CB1R
agonists enhanced the phosphorylation of GSK-3β. Therefore
we conclude that EA pretreatment protects against cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury through CB1R-mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3β.

Introduction
Stroke remains a significant concern in human health. Although administration of tissue type plasminogen activator
(t-PA) is an effective therapeutic in stroke, only 3–5 % of
patients are able to receive and potentially benefit from this
treatment, due in part to the narrow time window [1]. However, ischemic preconditioning provides a thoughtful alternative approach to relieve ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury [2],
although significant challenges need to be overcome for this
approach to be transferred to the bedside. Fortunately, various
non-ischemic preconditioning strategies are currently available, including inhaled or intravenous anesthetics, hyperbaric
oxygen [3–5]. Electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment is one of
the most lately proposed among these strategies [6].
EA originates from traditional Chinese medicine, and has
shown its effectiveness in many settings including analgesia,
motor function recovery, etc. [7, 8]. We have previously reported the protective effect of EA in reducing infarct size and

Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:326–336

improving the neurological score in transient cerebral ischemia [6]. Prior work suggests the importance of the endogenous cannabinoid system in the beneficial effects of EA
pretreatment, presumably by augmenting expression of the
cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) in the ischemic penumbra
[9]. Additional studies indicated that CB1R-mediated activation of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) and the extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway both
played an important role in EA pretreatment [10, 11]. However, further work is required to fully define the mechanisms
responsible for the beneficial effects of EA. The suggestion of
a potential role for glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in
EA pretreatment is also suggested from studies that have
demonstrated regulation of GSK-3β by CB1R in normal brain
cortex [12].
GSK-3β is a multi-functional molecule, and plays important
roles in many processes including cellular development
and differentiation, the stress response, inflammation, and
as such, is crucial in tissue protection [13, 14]. Moreover,
GSK-3β is implicated in the protection of brain tissues in
animals suffering from injuries such as ischemia and brain
trauma [15, 16].
Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether
the regulation of GSK-3β played an important role in
neuroprotection in the ischemic brain following EA pretreatment. In a rat model of experimental stroke, we hypothesized
that pretreatment with EA, would induce ischemic tolerance
and protect against ischemic stroke by a pathway dependent
on regulating the phosphorylation of GSK-3β through CB1Rmediated signaling.

intracerebroventricularlly at a dose of 15 mM in 50 % DMSO
and in a total volume of 10 μL 10 min before MCAO. The
vehicle group received 10 μL of 50 % DMSO that was delivered intraventricularly [18]. The selective GSK-3β inhibitor 4benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione (TDZD-8),
was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 mg/kg in 10 %
DMSO, 1.5 h following reperfusion [19]. The selective
CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloroethylamide (ACEA),
was delivered intraperitoneally at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg, in
5 % DMSO 30 min before MCAO [20]. All of these agents
were obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
The agents AM251 (a CB1R antagonist) and WIN55212-2
(CB1R agonist) were respectively dissolved in DMSO and
Tween-80, followed by dilution in normal saline (at a DMSO/
Tween-80/saline ratio of 1:1:18) before use. Both of these
agents were obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, Avon,
UK). The dose of 1 mg/kg that was selected for both AM251
and WIN55212-2 in this experiment was chosen based on
detailed data from previous studies [11].

Intracerebroventricular Injection
Anesthetized rats were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus
(Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) following which the bregma point
was exposed. The injection point was located 1.8 mm lateral
and 1.5 mm posterior to the bregma in the right hemisphere. A
hole was carefully drilled at this point, and a 25-μl Hamilton
syringe (80630, Hamilton Co., Reno, NV, USA) was fixed on
the stereotaxic apparatus, and advanced vertically through this
point to a depth of 4.0 mm beneath the dural surface. The right
lateral ventricle was then infused with a 10-μL volume at a
rate of 1 μl/min. The needle was removed slowly within 5 min
of initiating this process to prevent reflux.

Animals and Drugs
Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were obtained from The Experimental Animal Centre of the Forth Military Medical University. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics
Committee for Animal Experimentation and all animals received humane care in compliance with the guidelines for
Animal Experimentation of the Fourth Military Medical University (Xi’an, China). Rats were housed in a 12-h alternating
light and dark cycle, at a temperature of 20–25 °C, and an air
humidity of 60 %. Water and food were freely available. Rats
weighed 250–280 g and were randomized into different treatment groups.
Wortmannin, a selective phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) inhibitor, was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of
0.6 mg/kg in 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and at 30 min
before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) [17]. The
vehicle group received the same volume of DMSO alone.
LY294002, another selective PI3K inhibitor, was injected

Transfection of siRNA into the Rat Brain
Transfection of siRNA into SD rats was conducted in accordance with the in vivo procedures as previously described [9].
Rats were placed under anesthesia with 10 % chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg), following which, a stainless steel cannula was
stereotaxically implanted in the unilateral cerebral ventricle.
The stereotaxic coordinates were 1.8 mm posterior and
1.5 mm lateral to the bregma and a depth of 4.0 mm from
the surface of the skull. A 10-μL volume of 1 μg/μL CB1siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-270168), 25 nmol/L
GSK-3α siRNA (Cell Signaling Technology, #6312), or
control-siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-37007) of the
diluted mixture was delivered into the ipsilateral lateral ventricle according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The protein
expression was evaluated 3 or 5 days later by Western immunoblotting assay.

Electroacupuncture Pretreatment

Neurological Score

We performed EA pretreatment according to the established
protocol [21]. The acupoint "Baihui (GV 20)", which was
located at the intersection of the sagittal midline and the earline of the rat, was stimulated with a Hwato Electronic
Acupuncture Treatment Instrument (Model No. SDZ-V, Suzhou Medical Appliances Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China). The
parameters applied were an intensity of 1 mA, and a frequency of 2/15 Hz for 30 min. The rectal temperature was
monitored at 37.0±0.5 °C during EA pretreatment using a
surface heating plate. We performed EA pretreatment 2.5 h
before the operation. Control group rats received anesthesia
but were not stimulated.

Neurological deficits were evaluated at 72 h after reperfusion
by a blinded observer according to an 18-point neurological
scoring system as previously reported [22]. This evaluation
system contains spontaneous activity, side stroking, vibris
touch, limb symmetry, climbing, and forelimb walking.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Model
The intraluminal filament model of middle cerebral artery
occlusion was used to induce transient focal cerebral ischemia
as described previously [9]. In brief, rats were anesthetized
with 10 % chloral hydrate administered intraperitoneally (at a
dose of 350 mg/kg). A heat blunted 3–0 nylon suture was
inserted into the right common carotid artery, and advanced
though the internal carotid artery to obstruct the MCA. The
right external carotid artery and the common carotid artery
were both simultaneously ligated. The suture remained in
position for 2 h during this arterial occlusion, and subsequently removed to allow subsequent reperfusion. Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by transcranial laser Dopplar
flowmetry (PeriFlux 5000, Perimed AB, Sweden). The rats
for this procedure with >80 % flow reduction during the
ischemic period and >70 % flow recovery within the first
10 min of the reperfusion were included. For the Sham group,
the vessels were visualized and cleared for connective tissues,
and the three arteries were ligated without inserting the suture.

Western Immunoblot
At 2, 4, and 24 h post-reperfusion, animals were euthanized
with overdose of chloral hydrate, and the brains were promptly removed. Brain tissue corresponding to the ischemic penumbra was dissected as previously reported [21]. Briefly, a
4-mm thick coronal brain slice was obtained using a rat
matrix, which began 5 mm from the anterior tip of the frontal
lobe. Next, a longitudinal incision (from top to bottom) was
made 2 mm laterally from the midline through the ischemic
hemisphere. Finally, a transverse diagonal incision was made
approximately at the “2 o’clock” position to separate the
wedge-shaped penumbra. The tissue was homogenized in
ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, Nantong, China) with
1×Roche complete protease inhibitor cocktail. The whole
protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method, and Western immunoblotting was performed as previously
described [23]. The following primary antibodies were used:
Phospho-GSK-3β(Ser-9) monoclonal antibody, GSK-3β
monoclonal antibody (both used at a dilution of 1:1,000, Cell
Signaling Technology, USA), GAPDH polyclonal antibody
(1:1,000 dilution, CWBIO, China), Bax monoclonal antibody
(1:500 dilution, Epitomics, USA), Bcl-2 polyclonal antibody
(1:1,000 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), and βtubulin polyclonal antibody (1:1,000 dilution, CWBIO,
China). The secondary antibodies selected for this assay were
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or horseradish peroxidase goat anti-mouse (used at a dilution of
1:20,000, GSGB-BIO, China).

Measurement of Infarct Size
TUNEL Staining
Approximately 72 h following reperfusion, the brains were
removed quickly and the infarct size was assessed as previously
described [11]. Six slices of brain were obtained at 2-mm
intervals from the intersection of the lambdoidal suture to
the front by a brain matrix. The slices were stained in a 2 %
solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37 °C
for 20 min, then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 24 h.
The slices were photographed (Canon G12, Beijing, China)
and the infarct size was analyzed by an image analysis software program (Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended, USA). With
correction made for swelling, a relative infarct size measure
was made in accord with the following equation: relative
infarct size=(contralateral area−ipsilateral non-infarct area)/
contralateral area.

Tissues were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at 24 h after
reperfusion and neuronal apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra
was detected in situ by quantitative TUNEL staining as previously (11). Briefly, 32 pixels of 0.10 mm2 were located
under a light microscope using a ×100 magnification objective
lens, and the total number of positively stained cells in these
pixels was counted and subsequently expressed as cells per
square millimeter.
Statistical Analysis
All values, except for neurologic scores, were described as
mean ± SEM and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA,

any difference of GSK-3β Ser-9 phosphorylation between
Sham and EA groups before MCAO. However, we observed that EA enhanced GSK-3β phosphorylation as
compared with the MCAO group 2 h after reperfusion
(P<0.05). In addition, we did not see any difference
between the EA+MCAO and the MCAO alone groups at
4 h following reperfusion. But both groups at 4 h
displayed higher p-GSK-3β(Ser-9) expression levels than
that was seen in the Sham group (P<0.05).

GSK-3β Phosphorylation Mimicked the Neuroprotective
Effects of EA Pretreatment

In order to determine if GSK-3β was associated with the
beneficial effect of EA pretreatment, we assessed the level
of GSK-3β and p-GSK-3β(Ser-9) by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 1d). Simultaneously, we repeated the previous study here by using a one-time EA pretreatment 2.5 h
before MCAO. At 72 h after reperfusion, infarct sizes
were assessed and neurological scores were evaluated
(Fig. 1b, c). It was found that EA improved the outcome
of neurological behavior (Fig. 1b, P<0.05) and reduced
the infarct size (Fig. 1a, c, P<0.05). We did not observe

A selective GSK-3β inhibitor TDZD-8 was used to test the
role of GSK-3β in the protection seen by EA (Fig. 2). We
found that TDZD-8 reduced the infarct size and improved the
neurological score as compared with the MCAO group
(Fig. 2b, c, P<0.05) while the vehicle group showed no effect
as compared with the MCAO group, which suggested that
administration of TDZD-8 at an early phase of reperfusion
could mimic the neuroprotection of EA pretreatment. Moreover, GSK-3α siRNA had no effect the infarct size and
neurological score (Fig. 2d, e, f ).

PI3K Inhibitors Suppressed Phosphorylation of GSK-3β 2 h
After Reperfusion and Reversed the Neuroprotective Effects
of EA Pretreatment
To determine the involvement of GSK-3β in EA pretreatment,
the dephosphorylation of GSK-3β was needed. Thus, we used
the selective PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. By
Western immunoblotting analysis, we showed that both of
these inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of GSK-3β 2 h
after reperfusion (Fig. 3a, b). The phosphorylation of GSK-3β
was increased in the EA+MCAO group as compared with the
MCAO group (P<0.05). We also found that p-GSK-3β(Ser-9)
was decreased in both the EA+wrt group (Fig. 3a) and the
EA+LY group (Fig. 3b, P<0.05) as compared the EA+
MCAO-treated group. As expected, the EA+vehicle group
did not show any statistically significant difference with that
of the EA+MCAO group. Both wortmannin and LY294002
reversed any reduction in infarct size seen under conditions of
EA pretreatment as compared with the EA+MCAO group.

MCAO group in the penumbra 24 h after reperfusion, and TDZD-8
exerted the similar beneficial effect as that of EA. Both wortmannin and
LY294002 reversed the reduction of the TUNEL positive cells compared
with EA+MCAO group. MCAO significantly reduced the ratio of Bcl-2/

331

Additionally, the improvement in neurological outcome by EA
was abolished by both wortmannin and LY294002 as compared with the EA+MCAO group (Fig. 3c, d P<0.05). No
difference was seen when one compared the EA+vehicle
group and the EA+MCAO group.

Cellular Apoptosis After Reperfusion and Pharmacological
Intervention
Cellular apoptosis was increased in the MCAO group as
compared to the Sham group (P<0.05). EA pretreatment
reduced the number of apoptotic cell as compared with the
MCAO group (P<0.05), while treatment with wortmannin or
LY294002 abolished this benefit (P<0.05). When compared
with MCAO, treatment with TDZD-8 induced changes which
were similar to those seen following EA pretreatment, as
determined by the number of TUNEL positive cells (Fig. 4b,
P<0.05).

Bax 24 h after reperfusion in the penumbra compared with Sham group.
EA pretreatment and TDZD-8 partly reversed the reduction of the ratio
compared with MCAO group, but when wortmannin or LY294002 was
administrated, the increasing of the ratio was blocked in comparison to
EA+MCAO group. There were no differences between EA+MCAO and
EA+vehicle (W) groups, EA+MCAO and EA+vehicle (L) groups,
MCAO and vehicle (T) groups. #P<0.05 vs. Sham, *P<0.05 vs. MCAO,

In addition, MCAO significantly reduced the Bcl-2/Bax
ratio 24 h after reperfusion in the penumbra as compared with
the Sham group (P<0.05). By contrast, EA pretreatment and
TDZD-8 partly reversed the reduction of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio
as compared with the MCAO group (P<0.05). However,
under conditions of administering either wortmannin or
LY294002, any increase in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio was
blocked as compared with the EA+ MCAO-treated group
(P<0.05, Fig. 4c). Finally, we did not detect any significant changes between the following groups: (1) EA +MCAO versus EA+vehicle (W), (2) EA +MCAO versus
EA+vehicle (L), and (3) MCAO versus vehicle (T).
EA-Induced Phosphorylation of GSK-3β was CB1R

the EA+MCAO group. When
compared with the EA+MCAO
group, p-GSK-3β(Ser-9) levels
were reduced in EA+AM251

whereas there were no differences
between MCAO and two vehicle

CB1R by EA pretreatment was associated with posttranscriptional regulation of GSK-3β, we administered
the following agents respectively; AM251, CB1 siRNA,
WIN55212-2 (WIN), and ACEA. On administering these
agents, the expression of p-GSK-3β(Ser-9) was evaluated
by Western immunoblotting. We found that the expression of p-GSK-3β(Ser-9) was decreased in EA+AM251treated group and the EA+CB1 siRNA-treated group as
compared with the EA+MCAO group (P<0.05). However, we found no effect on p-GSK-3β(Ser-9) expression
in either the EA+vehicle-treated group or the EA+control siRNA-treated group (Fig. 5a, c). Expression of
p-GSK-3β(Ser-9) was increased in both the MCAO+WIN-treated group and the MCAO+ACEA group as
compared with the MCAO group (P<0.05). However,
no difference was found in the expression of p-GSK3β(Ser-9) in groups treated with either vehicle or MCAO
(Fig. 5b, d).

Discussion
Due to its safety, low cost, and efficacy, EA is recognized as a
viable alternative therapy in a wide range of clinical applications [24, 25]. It was first reported that pretreatment with EA
reduced the infarct size and improved neurological outcome in
an experimental stroke model [6]. While in the current study,
we found that EA pretreatment reduced infarct size and improved neurological outcome. Concordantly with previous
studies, EA pretreatment showed convincing protective effects by reducing the extent of cerebral I/R injury.
Great strides have been made in understanding the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of EA pretreatment.
Possible involvement of the adenosine A1 receptor in EA
pretreatment has been implicated, but in the absence of fully
appreciating the manner by which the receptor was altered [26].
In subsequent studies, we found that EA pretreatment increased
the release of enkephalins, which may have eventually activated the delta- and mu-opioid receptors [27]. Additional work
provided evidence of the protective role of molecules such as
activated ERK1/2 and the expression of the alpha7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (α7nAchR) following EA pretreatment
[10, 21]. However, the manner by which such molecules and
receptors networked and their putative role in cell-mediated
signal transduction remained undetermined.
One of the most compelling findings was that EA pretreatment-induced neuroprotection was possibly mediated
through an endocannabinoid-related mechanism. In this system, EA pretreatment increased the production of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) and N-arachidonoylethanolamine-anandamide (AEA), which elicited protective effects against transient cerebral I/R injury via CB1R
[9]. However, the downstream signal transduction pathways
were unclear, and thus the complete mechanisms involved
remained to be determined. Others have reported the regulation of GSK-3β by elegant experimental use of CB1R antagonist and agonist in brain cortex [12]. In such studies, the
link between EA pretreatment and regulation of GSK-3β
was postulated.
Besides its function in regulating physiological processes
such as glucose metabolism, cellular development, and differentiation [13, 14, 28], GSK-3β is also involved in cellular
resistance to various insults. The Ser-9 phosphorylation of
GSK-3β, which represents an inactivate status, enables tissues
to resist various physiological insults much more effectively.
By contrast, dephosphorylation of GSK-3β actually dampens
cellular resistance to such insults [15, 29, 30].
It would appear that GSK-3β also participates in I/R injury,
as pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3β renders tissue more
tolerant to ischemia. Additionally, some drugs and clinical
strategies confer a protective effect against ischemic injury
by inhibiting GSK-3β [16, 31]. The most direct evidence
demonstrated to date, showed that an active mutation of

333

GSK-3β abolished the protection of ischemic preconditioning
during heart ischemia and reperfusion [32]. With regard to
brain, the expression of GSK-3β has also been shown to be
very important. Several studies have indicated a role for GSK3β in recovery from brain trauma injury and intracerebral
hemorrhage [15, 33]. Indeed, GSK-3β plays multiple roles
in tissue damage and repair. GSK-3β has been shown to
regulate Nrf2/ARE transmitted signal, which is one of the
most important mechanisms for providing protection against
oxidative stress [34]. Regulation of GSK-3β also controls
immunological and inflammatory pathways [35]. The most
common functional role of GSK-3β during ischemic injury
was the determination of cell survival or cell death [36].
Interestingly, the process of neurogenesis also appeared to
be associated with the regulation of GSK-3β [37].
It is well established that GSK-3β is a key regulator during
neural damage, especially in the context of ischemic injury
[19, 38]. Thus, we hypothesized that the neuroprotection
afforded by EA pretreatment may be mediated through the
regulation of GSK-3β. In the present study, the level of pGSK-3β(Ser-9), which reflects the inactive form of GSK-3β
was evaluated [13]. Following reperfusion, the expression of
p-GSK-3β(Ser-9) began to increase at 4 h. This was also
consistent with others’ work [39]. However, we could not find
any difference between groups treated with EA+MCAO and
MCAO alone at 4 h following reperfusion. By contrast, 2 h
after reperfusion, the p-GSK-3β(Ser-9) was increased following EA pretreatment as compared with MCAO alone. This
initially indicated that phosphorylation of GSK-3β was associated with EA pretreatment. Therefore, for this reason, the
2-h time-point was chosen in the subsequent experiments.
Moreover, one could deduce that earlier inhibition of GSK3β may actually be more effective in the therapy of stroke. To
further test this hypothesis, a selective GSK-3β inhibitor
TDZD-8 was administrated 1.5 h after reperfusion. It appeared
that TDZD-8 exerted the same protective effect as EA pretreatment. GSK-3β inhibitors lithium and TDZD-8 could both
increase the Ser-9 phosphorylation, subsequently leading to
the protection against brain ischemia–reperfusion injury, even
if in the pathological status like diabetes [40, 41]. And by the
present experiment the time point of inhibitive intervention of
GSK-3β was extended to 1.5 h post reperfusion. However,
TDZD-8 could also lead to GSK-3α phosphorylation. In order
to verify the role of GSK-3α, GSK-3α siRNA was applied
and it turned out GSK-3α may not be involved.
Because of post-transcriptional regulation of GSK-3β and
no current specific agonist or activator, there was little we
could do to manipulate the activity of GSK-3β, with the
notable exceptions of introducing mutations in its active or
inactive forms [32]. Thus we attempted to activate GSK-3β
through mechanisms that exerted their regulatory effects more
upstream by pharmacological inhibition of PI3K-mediated
signal transduction.

334

Two different inhibitors were administrated before MCAO,
and the selection of the time point was decided in accord with
previously published studies [17, 18]. We found that phosphorylation of GSK-3β was reduced by the use of PI3K
inhibitors, and this was associated with an attenuated protective effect of EA. Besides GSK-3β, there are other signal
transduction pathways downstream of PI3K/Akt. Whether
these signals were involved in EA pretreatment-induced ischemic tolerance as opposed to GSK-3β remains undetermined. However, the reduction in GSK-3β phosphorylation was associated with the removal of the protective effect of
EA pretreatment. Given that (1) EA pretreatment increased
GSK-3β phosphorylation; (2) GSK-3β inhibitor prompted its
phosphorylation and mimicked the effects of EA pretreatment; these all provided persuasive evidence in support of
EA pretreatment induced tolerance to ischemia by a mechanism that was dependent, at least in part, on the inhibition of
GSK-3β.
Although the regulation of GSK-3β by CB1R in the brain
cortex has been reported [12], we believe that there was a
potential flaw with that experimental approach since it was
conducted with normal apparently healthy animals. Whether
regulation of GSK-3β by CB1R functions during ischemic
injury and is involved in EA pretreatment against cerebral
transient ischemia is still unknown. Both administration of
the CB1R selective antagonist AM251, and CB1R knockdown prior to MCAO, abolished any increase in p-GSK3β(Ser-9) that was induced by EA pretreatment. Additionally,
administration of the two agonists of CB1R before MCAO,
provoked enhanced expression levels of p-GSK-3β(Ser-9)
after reperfusion, consistent with EA pretreatment. Thus, we
demonstrated the CB1R-dependent regulation of GSK-3β by
EA pretreatment.
GSK-3β is an important regulator of mitochondriaassoci-ated cell death [42]. GSK-3β regulates the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in a way
that altered the membrane permeability of mitochondria.
The opening of mPTP, which is mediated by activation
of GSK-3β, leads to swelling of the mitochondria, their
dysfunction, and the initiation of apoptosis or programmed
cell death. As our TUNEL staining showed, EA reduced
cellular apoptosis while activation of GSK-3β reversed
this effect. In addition, treatment with TDZD-8 also reduced cellular apoptosis.
Bax collaborates with Bak to permeabilize the outer
membrane of mitochondria, which leads to the initiation
of an apoptotic cascade when the cell suffers from injuries.
By contrast, the Bcl-2 family proteins inhibit this process
[43]. Thus, we evaluated the balance of the Bcl-2/Bax
ratio. We found that this ratio was reduced by treatment
with EA and TDZD-8 and was reversed by activation of
GSK-3β, an observation that was consistent with the
number of apoptosis cells. The apoptotic change also

Mol Neurobiol (2014) 49:326–336

supported the observations of infarct size and neurological
score. Although GSK-3β-mediated Bax activation has
been reported in renal cells, we submit that more direct
evidence is still needed to fully elucidate the pathway
responsible for GSK-3β-mediated inhibition of apoptosis
in neurons [44]. According to our data, we conclude that
the intrinsic apoptosis pathway may be involved in the
mechanism of EA pretreatment, and this may be further
orchestrated by the regulation of GSK-3β.

Summary
Our studies strongly suggested that EA pretreatment affords
considerable protection against transient cerebral ischemic
injury, which may be induced by enhanced inhibition of
GSK-3β through CB1R (Fig. 6). Although more studies are
needed to fully elucidate the signal transduction pathways
involved between CB1R and GSK-3β, and to provide an
improved understanding of the regulation of apoptosis by
GSK-3β, our current findings may reveal a novel mechanism
of CB1R-dependent regulation of GSK-3β that appears to be
induced by EA pretreatment. These observations support the
notion of the clinical utility of inhibiting GSK-3β much earlier
after acute ischemic stroke.

via CB1R. EA pretreatment increases the production of the endogenous
cannabinoids AEA and 2-AG, which subsequently activate CB1R [9].
Activated CB1R promotes the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser-9
followed by ischemia and reperfusion. The enhanced phosphorylation
of GSK-3β augments the expression of Bcl-2 while it dampens the
expression of Bax. The combined effect of this is to block neuronal
apoptosis, and the desirable goal of protecting cerebral neurons from
ischemia
