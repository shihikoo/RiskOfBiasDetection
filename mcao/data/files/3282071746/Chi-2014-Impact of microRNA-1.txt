Introduction

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small noncoding RNAs  22 bp in length. The discovery of miRNA has
provided a new understanding of the gene expression regulation that miRNAs could negatively modulate protein expressions by degrading or repressing their target mRNAs (Bartel,
2004, 2009). MiRNAs are predicted to regulate more than 50%
of all the protein-coding genes, and an individual miRNA
could modulate hundreds of protein-coding genes (Lewis
et al., 2005). Thus, it was easy to understand that miRNAs
could inﬂuence various cellular activities. Also, extensive
reports have demonstrated that miRNAs were involved in
almost every major cellular process, such as growth, development, differentiation, and death (Liu et al., 2012; Qin et al.,
2012; Yang et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2014). Recently, accumulative data suggested that miRNAs are related to brain diseases,
including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cerebroma, and ischemic stroke (Qin et al., 2012; Kim et al.,
2014; Sun et al., 2014).
According to the neuroimaging data, ischemic stroke was
the most common consequence of middle cerebral artery
(MCA) branch infarct (Selim, 2007). There was a complex
series of signaling molecules and pathways involved in
the ischemic core. Among them, miRNAs have recently
attracted more and more attention. Many studies found
differentially expressed miRNAs with ischemic brain injury,
which were identiﬁed using miRNA proﬁling techniques in
rat MCA occlusion (MCAO) models as well as in stroke
patients (Dharap et al., 2009; Jeyaseelan et al., 2008; Liu
et al., 2010; Tan et al., 2009; Yuan et al., 2010). We also found
19 differentially expressed miRNAs in MCAO-treated mouse
brain using large-scale miRNA microarrays (Liu et al., 2012).
Several studies further showed that altered expression and
function of speciﬁc miRNAs, such as miR-181 (Peng et al.,
2013), miR-497 (Yin et al., 2010), miR-134 (Schratt et al., 2006),
and miR-431 (Wu and Murashov, 2013), could modulate postischemic neural death, plasticity, and regeneration by altering target gene expressions. These ﬁndings suggested that
miRNAs might be mediators of post-stroke pathological
changes and therapeutic targets in stroke. However, the
changes and roles of miRNAs' response to ischemic injury
are highly complex and to better understand their role in
ischemic stroke requires further study.
MiR-134, one of the 19 differentially expressed miRs in
MCAO-treated mouse brain, could target 30 -untranslated
region (UTR) of HSPA12B, which was previously tested using
luciferase reporter assay. In our previous study, we found
that downregulating miR-134 could induce neuroprotection
against ischemic injury by upregulating HSPA12B protein
expression in mouse N2A neuroblastoma cell tread with

oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) (Chi et al., 2014). In this
study, we further investigated the role and regulation of miR134 on HSPA12B against ischemic injury both in primary
neuronal cell tread by OGD in vitro and in mouse brain with
MCAO in vivo.

Changes in miR-134 levels and neuronal cell death in
OGD-induced primary cultured neuronal cell and MCAO mice
brains
To further conﬁrm possible regional and spatial changes of
miR-134 expression in primary cultured neuronal cells
and the ischemic hemisphere cortex of MCAO mice, we
tested miR-134 levels using quantitative real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) following
OGD treatment and transient MCAO after reperfusion at
various times. As shown in Fig. 1A, the relative expression
levels of miR-134 increased from 12 h after reoxygenation,
peaked at one day, and then decreased gradually (nPo0.05,
n¼ 5 per group). The most serious cell injury was at one day
after reoxygenation in OGD-treated primary cultured neuronal cells parallel to the expression of miR-134 (nPo0.05, n¼ 8
per group). To observe the relationship between miR-134 and
the ischemic insult in vivo, the neurological severity score
(NSS) test and Nissl staining were performed. After reperfusion, NSS scores were elevated at 12 h and peaked at one day
compared with the sham group (Fig. 2A, nPo0.05, n¼ 6 per
group). Similarly, neuronal cell loss in ischemic cortex peaked
at one day after reperfusion (Fig. 3A and B, nPo0.05, n¼ 5 per
group). We also detected the cleaved caspase-3 (cl-caspase-3)
levels in cerebral ischemic mice cortexes using Western
blotting. The cleaved caspase-3 protein levels are a major
indicator for apoptosis. The Western blotting results showed
that cleaved caspase-3 levels increased from 12 h and peaked
at days one and three (Fig. 2E and F, nPo0.05, n¼ 5 per group).
Additionally, HSPA12B protein expression increased at 12 h
but decreased at 24 h, and then it increased gradually (Fig. 2C
and D, nPo0.05, n¼ 5 per group). It is worth mentioning that
HSPA12B expression was strongly inducible by ischemia or
heat shocks both in vivo and in vitro experiments (Wang et al.,
2010; Li et al., 2013; Ma et al., 1832), and other control factors
together made HSPA12B highly expressed against brain injury
at 12 h after ischemic stroke. Also, the opposite trend
between miR-134 and HSPA12B protein levels suggests that
perhaps there is a modulation of HSPA12B protein levels by
miR-134 under ischemic conditions. These data indicated
that miR-134 might be involved in the ischemic insult by
regulating HSPA12B protein levels.

2.2.
Role of miR-134 on OGD-induced cell death in primary
cortical neuronal cells
To explore the functional signiﬁcance of miR-134 in regulating OGD-induced primary neuronal cell death, we used premiR-134 or pre-miR-134 inhibitor to alter miR-134 levels in
cultured primary cortical neuronal cells. Quantitative realtime RT-PCR analysis revealed that miR-134 expression
increased to more than 9-fold by pre-miR-134 transfection
and was reduced to less than 0.5-fold by pre-miR-134
inhibitor transfection (Fig. 4A, nPo0.05, n¼ 5 per group).
OGD-induced primary neuronal cell death was detected using
MTT assay. As demonstrated in Fig. 4B, upregulated miR-134
substantially aggravated 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenationinduced primary neuronal cell death compared to the normal
group after 1 h OGD and 24 h reoxygenation. Down-regulated
miR-134, however, effectively reduced 1 h OGD and
24 h reoxygenation-induced primary neuronal cell death
(nPo0.05, n ¼8 per group). Neuronal cell apoptosis is known
to be an important part of MCAO injury, and caspase-3
activation is a prominent feature of apoptosis (Krupinski

et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2010). Therefore, Western blotting
and TUNEL staining were performed to examine active
capase-3 changes. As shown in Fig. 4C and D, miR-134
overexpression remarkably increased cleaved caspase-3 protein expression levels after 1 h OGD and 24 h reoxygenation
compared to the non-transfection group subjected to OGD
exposure, whereas miR-134 knockdown effectively decreased
cleaved caspase-3 protein levels (nPo0.05, #Po0.05, n¼ 6 per
group). Consistent with the Western blotting result, TUNEL
positive cells remarkably increased after pre-miR-134 transfection and decreased after pre-miR-134 inhibitor transfection after 1 h OGD and 24 h reoxygenation compared to the
non-transfection group (Fig. 5, nPo0.05, n ¼6 per group).

2.3.

HSPA12B might be a target of miR-134

According to previous reports, miRNAs play roles by degrading or repressing their target mRNAs. Through bioinformatics
analysis, we found that miR-134 had many potential targets
and focused on HSPA12B, a member of the HSP70 family,
which was correlated with cell apoptosis response to
ischemic injury (Li et al., 2013; Ma et al., 1832; Kang et al.,
2013). We had already demonstrated that miR-134 directly
recognized the 30 - UTR of HSPA12B in Mouse N2A neuroblastoma cells in our previous study. To further verify miR-134's
biological role in regulating HSPA12B protein, Western blotting was performed in primary neuronal cell samples.
As shown in Fig. 6A and B, miR-134 inhibitor, but not its
negative control, could upregulate HSPA12B protein levels
after 1 h OGD and 24 h reoxygenation, whereas pre-miR-134
could downregulate HSPA12B protein levels compared to the
normal group (nPo0.05, n ¼6 per group). However, HSPA12B
mRNA levels showed no signiﬁcant changes (Fig. 6C, n¼ 5 per
group). The inconsistency between mRNA and HSPA12B
protein levels indicated that miR-134 likely regulated
HSPA12B protein by a post-transcriptional modulation under
ischemic-like conditions in vitro.

HSPA12B knockdown blocked neuroprotection induced
by pre-miR-134 inhibitor in vitro

cell death in OGD-treated primary neuronal cells. A:
miR-134 levels were conﬁrmed using quantitative real-time
RT-PCR, and miR-134 expression was normalized to U6.
miR-134 levels increased from 12 h after reoxygenation,
peaked at 1 day, and then decreased gradually in primary
cells. nPo0.05, vs. normal group, n ¼5 per group. B: MTT
result showed cells increased from 12 h, and the most
serious injuries were at 1 day after reoxygenation in OGDtreated primary neuronal cells. nPo0.05, vs. normal group,
n¼ 8 per group.

miRNAs usually have many targets, so we wished to test
whether HSPA12B was the important target in ischemic
injury. To inhibit HSPA12B protein levels, we transfected
HSPA12B siRNA into primary cortical neuronal cells. Western
blotting was used to examine whether HSPA12B protein
expression was effectively interfered with. As shown in
Fig. 7A and B, HSPA12B siRNA transfection signiﬁcantly
inhibited HSPA12B protein expressions in primary neuronal
cells (nPo0.05, n¼ 5 per group). MTT results showed that
HSPA12B knockdown could signiﬁcantly aggravate primary
neuronal cell injuries after 1 h OGD and 24 h reoxygenation
following 48 h HSPA12B siRNA transfection, whereas
HSPA12B siRNA control did not harm primary neuronal cells'
survival (Fig. 7B, nPo0.05, n¼ 6 per group). We also found
that HSPA12B knockdown decreased neuronal cell survival
compared to pre-miR-134 inhibitor transfection after
co-transfection with pre-miR-134 inhibitor in OGD-treated
primary neuronal cells (Fig. 7C, #Po0.05, &Po0.05, n¼6
per group). Additionally, HSPA12B knockdown resulted in

increased active caspase-3 expression compared to pre-miR134 or pre-miR-134 inhibitor transfection (Fig. 7D and E,
#
Po0.05, &Po0.05, n¼ 5 per group). The data suggested that
HSPA12B was an important target of miR-134, and HSPA12B
siRNA could block pre-miR-134 inhibitor-induced neuroprotection in vitro.

Discussion

Perioperative stroke is one of the most serious surgery
complications leading to increased in-hospital mortality and
disability rates and reduces 5-year survival rates (McLean
et al., 1994; Shaw et al., 1987). Thus, our doctors focus far

more on postoperative stroke. As the neuroimaging data
show, in patients who have intraoperative stroke, the territory of the MCA branches more frequently suffer from multiple infarcts (Selim, 2007). Therefore, the study chose both a
mouse MCAO model in vivo and a primary neuronal cell OGD
model in vitro to mimic cerebral ischemia injury.
With the recent rapid acceleration in the ﬁeld of miRNA
research, miRNAs have been most intensely studied and
proven signiﬁcant for diverse cellular functions, particularly
in controlling transcription and translation to maintain
normal cellular physiology (Bartel, 2004, 2009; Lewis et al.,
2005; Tan et al., 2011; Ouyang et al., 2013). More importantly,
recent evidence suggests that miRNAs are involved in the
pathophysiology of ischemic stroke. Following a stroke,

neurotransmitter function; apoptotic, autophagic, and necrotic cell death; oxidative metabolism; and protein chaperones
are also altered, and are accompanied by miRNAs changing
(Peng et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2010; Schratt et al., 2006; Wu and
Murashov, 2013; Xie et al., 2013). This encouraged us to
believe that miRNAs played an important role in neuronal
cell death in the post-ischemic brain. In this study, we
focused on the effects of miR-134 on neuronal cell survival
against ischemic injury.
MiR-134 is a brain-speciﬁc miRNA that has been implicated in the regulation of neural physiology or plasticity.
MiR-134 played a role in the stage-speciﬁc cortical development, in which miR-134 promoted neural progenitor proliferation and counteracted cell apoptosis and differentiation
(Gaughwin et al., 2011). Studies also showed miR-134 played
vital roles in neuritogenesis, excitability, and synapse
maturation (Schratt et al., 2006; Gaughwin et al., 2011; Fiore
et al., 2009; Jimenez-Mateos et al., 2012). Recent studies
demonstrated that the aberrant expression of miR-134 has
been associated with brain diseases. Silencing miR-134
expression using antagonist rendered mouse refractory to
seizures and exerted neuroprotective actions (Fiore et al.,
2009). Additionally, miR-134, as a tumor suppressor, could

play an important role in glioblastoma, in which miR-134
overexpression promoted glioblastoma cells apoptosis and
inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and migration by regulating Nanog protein expression (Niu et al., 2013). MiR-134
could potentially target many mRNAs, such as HSPA8, HSPA5,
limk1, nanog, mgi2, and ldh3a, using bioinformatics analysis.
However, they have no signiﬁcant impact on stroke according
to the references and our previous experiments except
HSPA12B. We found miR-134 targeted 3'UTR of HSPA12B by
luciferase reporter assay in N2A cells. To further verify miR134's role in stroke, we performed the study in primary
cortical neuronal cells and MCAO mice.
This study showed that miR-134 levels began to increase
in the infarct hemisphere of 1 h MCAO mice and primary
neuronal cells after 1 h OGD, which was consistent with
previous reports that miR-134 was upregulated in 1 h MCAO
rats and upregulated above 2-fold at the 24-h time point after
reperfusion (Jeyaseelan et al., 2008). Interestingly, we found
obvious neuronal cell apoptosis changes in MCAO-treated
mouse ischemic brain with miR-134 changes. We also found
that upregulated miR-134 aggravated OGD-induced neuronal
apoptosis, whereas its repression reduced OGD-induced neuronal apoptosis. Therefore, miR-134 might play a critical role

Fig. 4 – miR-134 regulated OGD-induced primary neuronal cell death. A: Quantitative real-time RT-PCR results showed that
72 h of pre-miR-134 or pre-miR-134 inhibitor transfection could cause a signiﬁcant up- or downregulation of miR-134
expression levels in primary neuronal cells. nPo0.05, vs. normal group, n ¼5 per group. B: Cell viability was determined using
MTT assay. The result suggested that miR-134 overexpression by pre-miR-134 transfection substantially aggravated the 1 h

effectively reduced 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation-induced neuronal cell death. nPo0.05, vs. normal group; #Po0.05, vs. nontrans group subjected to OGD, n ¼8 per group. C and D: Representative Western blotting results demonstrated the changes of
cleaved caspase-3 protein transfected with pre-miR-134 or pre-miR-134 inhibitor in primary cells after 1 h OGD and 24 h
reoxygenation. Quantitative analysis showed that miR-134 overexpression remarkably increased the cleaved caspase-3
protein expression levels, whereas knockdown of miR-134 effectively decreased cleaved caspase-3 protein levels. nPo0.05, vs.

in regulating ischemic neuronal apoptosis. Stroke-induced
neural death includes apoptosis, programmed necrosis, and
autophagic cell death. In this study, we used TUNEL assay to
detect neural apoptosis. However, this is not a truly speciﬁc
test for apoptosis, so positive cells not only include apoptotic
cell death, but also programmed necrotic cell death. Precisely,
cell apoptosis was also detected by determining cleaved
caspase-3 expression levels. The two assays had the ability
to reﬂect neuronal apoptosis in general. We next identiﬁed
the percentage of neuronal apoptosis in ischemic injuries by
manipulating miR-134 expression levels.
According to our previous study, miR-134 induced neuroprotection against ischemic injury in N2A cells by regulating
HSPA12B protein expression. HSPA12B is a newly discovered
member of the HSP70 protein family (Han et al., 2003). It was
ﬁrst reported that HSPA12B was predominantly expressed in

endothelial cells, but also found in the brain, heart, kidney,
and lungs (Han et al., 2003; Steagall et al., 2006). Subsequently, reports showed that HSPA12B played an important
role in the proliferation and migration of human umbilical
vein endothelial cells and was essential in the vascular
development of zebraﬁsh (Hu et al., 2006). Recent studies
indicated that HSPA12B expression was strongly increased in
OGD-induced PC12 cells and in active microglial cells (Kang
et al., 2013; Cui et al., 2010). HSPA12B was also involved in
organ ischemic injury. HSPA12B overexpression signiﬁcantly
decreased cell injury and apoptosis in the ischemic hemispheres and exhibited improvement in neurological deﬁcits
following cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (Ma et al., 1832).
Upregulated HSPA12B could attenuate cardiac dysfunction
and remodeling after myocardial infarction mainly by inhibiting cardiomyocyte apoptosis and promoting myocardial

angiogenesis (Li et al., 2013). However, the regulation and role
of HSPA12B in protecting neural cells from ischemic injury
are still unclear. According to our results, miR-134 overexpression could aggravate neuronal cell death by inhibiting
HSPA12B expression, whereas down-regulated miR-134 could
induce neuroprotection by upregulating HSPA12B expression.

The ﬁndings of up- and downregulation of miR-134regulating HSPA12B protein levels suggested that miR-134
might be upstream of HSPA12B. We could not rule out the
possibility that miR-134 was downstream, but we could
rule out the possibility of parallel mechanisms affected by
miR-134 without proceeding toward protective mechanism

Conclusion

In conclusion, miR-134 overexpression aggravated neuronal
cell death after 1 h OGD in primary neuronal cells, and miR134 suppression induced neuroprotection against ischemic
injury by regulating HSPA12B protein levels, which suggested
a potential therapeutic target for ischemic stroke treatment.

Experimental procedure

5.1.

Animals

Adult male C57BL/6J mice weighing 18–22 g (6–8 weeks old)
were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of the
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. To minimize the
number of animals used and their suffering, all procedures
were performed in accordance with the National Institute of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(NIH Publication No. 80-23, revised 1996) and were consistent
with the principles set by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Capital Medical University.
All animals were fasted and did not drink 4 h before
surgery. They were housed in ventilated cages on 12-h
light/dark cycles with ambient temperatures of 25 1C, and
they had free access to food and water.

quantitative analysis results showed that pre-miR-134 could
downregulate HSPA12B, whereas pre-miR-134 inhibitor
signiﬁcantly upregulated HSPA12B protein levels in primary
cells after 1 h OGD and 24 h reoxygenation. nPo0.05, vs.

determined using real-time RT-PCR. The PCR data were
normalized to β-actin. The results showed that HSPA12B
mRNA levels had no signiﬁcant changes between groups. All
data were presented as the means7S.E.

The mouse MCAO model of ischemic stroke was carried out as
previously described (Peng et al., 2013; Yin et al., 2010). Brieﬂy,
mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg i.
p.) and placed in a feedback-regulated heating pad, which
maintains body core temperature at 36.5–37.0 1C. We exposed
the left common carotid artery (CCA), left external carotid artery
(ECA), and the left internal CCA (ICA) bluntly under the view of
stereo microscope (Stemi 2000, Zeiss). Then, one suture was tied
at the distal end of the ECA permanently, another was tied at the
proximal end of ECA artery temporarily, and the CCA was
temporally occluded using a suture as well. After that, a small
incision was cut into the ECA artery between the permanent and
temporary sutures, and a 5-0 surgical nylon ﬁlament with a
round tip (0.23 mm in diameter) was gently inserted into the ICA
lumen until resistance was felt, meaning occlude the origin of
MCA. After 1 h, MCAO mice were allowed to recover by removing
the suture. In the sham group, all procedures were carried out
except for a ﬁlament insertion. The normal group in vivo had
naive adult C57BL/6J mice without any procedures. During the
surgical procedures and during the following days, body temperature was maintained at 36.5–37.0 1C, and the mice were
injected with 0.5 ml saline to avoid dehydration. After 12 h, 24 h,
three days, or seven days reperfusion, mice were killed under
anesthesia and their brains were removed and collected at

inhibitor-mediated neuroprotection against OGD-induced
neuronal cell injury in vitro.

Experimental stroke

Primary cortical neuronal cell culture and transfection

Cortical neuronal cells were isolated from newborn C57BL/6J
mice at post-natal day, as previously described (Xie et al.,

2013; Scheibe et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, cortices were dissected out
in DMEM and treated for 15 min at 37 1C conditions in 0.25%
Trypsin. Then, trypsin activity was blocked by washing in
DMEM medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 10%
fetal bovine serum, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin.
The neuronal cells were triturated using a 1-ml glass pipette
to promote the release of individual neuronal cells into the
solution and plated onto poly-L-lysine coated cover slips,
6-well plates, or 100 mm dishes in a 37 1C humidiﬁed chamber (Thermo Electron LED GmbH, Langenselbold, Germany)
containing 5% CO2/95% O2. Four hours later, the medium was
replaced with serum-free neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% B27 (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml
penicillin/streptomycin. Subsequently, 50% of the medium
was replaced every three days. Five days after in vitro culture,
cells were infected with lentiviral vector (LV)-pre-miR-134
inhibitor-GFP, LV-pre-miR-134-GFP, LV-miR control-GFP (Genepharma, Shanghai, PR China), or left untreated. We directly
added lentivirus suspension containing 1.0  109 TU/ml in the
medium of 5-day primary mixed neuron cultures with a
multiplicity of infection at 1:5 (cells to virus units) or cotransfected HSPA12B and its negative control siRNAs

(GenePharma) at a ﬁnal concentration of 50 mM. Twelve hours
later, the culture medium was replaced with new growth
culture and continued to incubate in the chamber.

5.4.

OGD and cell viability assay

To mimic the ischemic-like condition in vitro, neuronal cells
were exposed to OGD conditions after 72 h transfection.
Culture medium was replaced with glucose-free DMEM media
(Gibco), and cells were transferred into the anaerobic chamber perfused with 5% CO2 and 95% N2 for 1 h. Cells were then
returned to culture in growth culture containing glucose
under normoxic conditions for reoxygenation for 24 h. Cells
were then harvested for cell death assay, RT-PCR, TUNEL
staining, or Western blot analysis. Of note, control cell
cultures were always placed in norm-oxygenated culture
containing glucose.
Cell viability assay was performed using the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide
(MTT; Applichem, Omaha, NE) following the manufacturer's
instructions. Cells were cultured at a density of 104/well in
96-well plates. After 72 h transfection, 20 ul MTT solution was

brain research 1592 (2014) 22–33

added to each well at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and
cells continued to incubate for 4 h at 37 1C in the dark.
To make crystals fully resolved, 150 ul dimethylsulfoxide
was added to each well on the shaker for 10 min at room
temperature. Then, the absorbance was measured at 490 nm.
Data were expressed as average percentages of viable cells
versus the respective normal control. In the normal group
in vitro, cells were without virus infection and OGD treatment.

5.5.
Isolation of total RNA and quantitative real-time RTPCR analyses
Total RNA, including miRs, was done aseptically from neuron
cells and cerebral cortexes using the miRCURY RNA Isolation
Kit (Exiqon A/S, Vedbaek, Denmark) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, we used the NanoDropND-1000
spectrophotometry (NanoDrop Tech, Wilmington, DE) to
detect the RNA concentrations. RT reactions were performed
using the miRCURY LNA Universal RT miRNA PCR (Exiqon
A/S). The 20-ml RT reaction solutions, containing 25–50 ng
RNAs in 14 ml, 5  reaction buffer in 4 ml, and enzyme mix in
2 ml, were incubated for 60 min at 42 1C, and then the reverse
transcriptase was inactivated by heat for 5 min at 95 1C.
Primers used for quantitative real-time PCR were as
follows: HSPA12B forward: 50 -AGGAAGCTCTAGGCAATCGT30 ; reverse: 50 -TGACTTCAGGAACTTCAAGGCTC-30 . β-actin
forward: 50 -ATATCGCTGCGCTGGTCGTC-30 ; reverse: 50 -AGGAT
GGCGTGAGGGAGAGC-30 . The real-time PCR was performed in
20 ml of reaction volume containing 10 ml SYBR Green master
mix, 2 ml LNA PCR primer mix, and 8 ml diluted cDNA template
under the following procedures: polymerase activation/denaturation (95 1C for 10 min) and 40 ampliﬁcation cycles (95 1C
for 10 s and 60 1C for 1 min). The β-actin and U6 snRNA served
as internal references to normalize mRNA and miR expressions, respectively. Thereafter, we analyzed their expressions
using the 2 ΔΔCt method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).

5.6.

Western blotting

Total protein was extracted from the brain or neuron cells as
previously reported (Scheibe et al., 2012; Li et al., 2006).
Protein (30–60 ug) was loaded into each lane and subjected
to 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE at 30 mA for 2 h and then transferred
to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, UK) at 400 mA for 40 min. Thereafter, the membranes were incubated by 10% skim milk in Tween/Trisbuffered salt solution (20 mM Tris–Cl, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl
and 0.05% Tween-20) at room temperature for 1 h. The
membranes were then incubated with the primary antibodies: HSPA12B (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, USA) or
Caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000; Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA) at 4 1C overnight. After incubating with donkey
anti-goat IgG (1:4000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Stressgen
Biotechnologies, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), signal
bands were visualized and quantiﬁed by chemiluminescence
(GE Healthcare) and the GelDoc-2000 Imagine System, respectively. The β-actin was used as a loading control to normalize
protein levels.

TUNEL and DAPI staining

The TUNEL staining kit (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR
red, Roche, New York, NY 10016, USA) could detect and
quantify apoptosis at the single cell level based on DNA
strand break labeling (Kim et al., 2012; Sarkissian et al., 2014).
The kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Neuron cells were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated glass
coverslips and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 60 min
at room temperature after 72 h of lentiviral vector transfection. Subsequently, the cells were permeabilized and incubated with the TUNEL reaction mixture containing TdT and
TMR-dUTP for 30 min in the dark. To stain total nuclei and
monitor intact, condensed, and fragmented nuclei, TUNELstained cells were counterstained with 4, 6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma, Saint Louis, MO). After washing,
the label incorporated at the damaged sites in the DNA was
visualized using ﬂuorescence microscopy, and each coverslip
had three randomly selected regions.

5.8.
Measurement of neurological deﬁcit and Nissl
staining
To evaluate neurological behavior, we performed a neurological deﬁcit scoring system test according to Table 1 at 12 h, 1
day, 3 days, and 7 days after transient MCAO was done by a
blinded observer following a modiﬁed method (Liu and
Cheung, 2013; Pang et al., 2014). The scores were summed
and represented the neurological deﬁcit score (0–10). The
higher the score, the more severe was the injury.
Neuronal cell damage in brain sections was determined
using Nissl staining. This method is used to detect the nuclei
of neurons in ﬁxed, embedded, and frozen tissue. The Nissl
body will be stained purple-blue. Neuronal cells that had
shrunken cell bodies or surrounding empty spaces were
considered destined to die and excluded from the counting.
The data were expressed as the number of surviving cells/
ﬁeld. The procedure was as follows: (1) Mice brains were
removed after being anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium
(60 mg/kg i.p.) and post-ﬁxed for 24 h in 4% PFA at 4 1C and
then were successively immersed in 20% and 30% sucrose
solution at 4 1C to dry-protect. (2) The brains were sectioned
coronally at 20 μm thickness. Sections were stained with
Table 1 – Neurological deﬁcit scoring system test.

0.04% cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in acetate buffer
for 1 h, and then sections were dehydrated in a graded series
of ethanol (70, 80, 90, and 100%), cleared in xylene, ﬁtted with
coverslips, and evaluated using light microscopy (Nikon 50i).
Five brain sections were selected for each animal and there
were three images per section.

Statistical analysis

The non-parametric data were transformed into quantitative
data using Sham or Normal as reference standard. Data were
expressed as means7S.E. SPSS version 11.5 was used to
perform statistical analysis. Statistical comparisons were
made using one-way ANOVA and post hoc Scheffe tests.
Po0.05 was taken to be statistically signiﬁcant.
