Ischemia initiates a complicated biochemical cascade of
events that triggers neuronal death. This study focuses
on glutamate-mediated neuronal tolerance to ischemia–
reperfusion. We employed an animal model of lifelong
excess release of glutamate, the glutamate dehydrogenase 1 transgenic (Tg) mouse, as a model of in vivo glutamate preconditioning. Nine- and twenty-two-month-old
Tg and wild-type (wt) mice were subjected to 90 min of
middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by 24 hr of
reperfusion. The Tg mice suffered significantly reduced
infarction and edema volume compared with their wt
counterparts. We further analyzed proteasomal activity,
level of ubiquitin immunostaining, and microtubuleassociated protein-2A (MAP2A) expression to understand
the mechanism of neuroprotection observed in the Tg
mice. We found that, in the absence of ischemia, the Tg
mice exhibited higher activity of the 20S and 26S proteasomes, whereas there was no significant difference in the
level of hippocampal ubiquitin immunostaining between
wt and Tg mice. A surprising, significant increase
was observed in MAP2A expression in neurons of the Tg
hippocampus following ischemia–reperfusion compared
with that in wt hippocampus. The results suggest
that increased proteasome activity and MAP2A synthesis
and transport might account for the effectiveness
of glutamate preconditioning against ischemia–reperfusion. VC 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Stroke results in a rapid cessation of blood flow that
compromises energy metabolism in affected brain tissues
and leads to large increases in glutamate release (Benveniste et al., 1984). Glutamate is ubiquitously distributed in
the brain, is present in concentrations that are higher than
those of any other amino acid (Fonnum, 1984), and functions as the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the
central nervous system (CNS). Previous studies have
demonstrated that blocking ionotropic glutamate receptors significantly reduces ischemic damage (Sims and
Muyderman, 2010). This is attributed to the triggering,
by the released glutamate, of an intracellular excitotoxic
cascade involving an excessive accumulation of calcium
(Ca21) and activation of downstream pathways that cause

cell death. Therefore, impeding the development of
excitotoxicity in animal experimental stroke has been a
frequently targeted mechanism in the development of
neuroprotective stroke treatments (O’Collins et al., 2006;
Minnerup et al., 2012). The effect of more than 20 antiexcitatory drugs has been evaluated in more than 270 preclinical studies, yet none of them has been shown to be
effective in the treatment of stroke in humans (O’Collins
et al., 2006).
There are increased efforts to identify potential strategies to protect neurons following ischemic stroke. A current focus is on understanding the protective mechanisms
that induce tolerance following ischemic preconditioning.
Current knowledge suggests that preconditioning with a
brief period of ischemia is an effective approach to
decrease neuronal death after a more-severe ischemic episode (Kirino, 2002). The same concept can also be
applied to excitotoxicity in which preconditioning, with
a mild glutamate-induced stress, can promote a tolerant
state that reduces the injury caused by a subsequent, more
severe glutamate exposure. The effect of glutamate preconditioning in the development of resistance to a subsequent ischemic insult has been assessed previously,
although such preconditioning was produced in in vitro,
not in vivo, preparations through the addition of exogenous glutamate or glutamate analogs, such as receptor
agonists or antagonists. For example, the death of cortical
neurons in primary culture following in vitro ischemia is
prevented by pre-exposure of the cells to N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA), a selective glutamate NMDA receptor
agonist (Lin et al., 2008). In other studies, the ischemic

preconditioning of primary hippocampal neurons was disrupted following exposure to the NMDA receptor inhibitor MK-801 (Mabuchi et al., 2001), and the ischemic
preconditioning of cocultures of neurons and glial cells
was suppressed following exposure to the NMDA receptor inhibitor 3-([D]-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1phosphonic acid (Grabb and Choi, 1999). Both of these
studies provided indirect evidence of glutamate involvement in the process of ischemic preconditioning. However, no studies have examined the role of endogenous,
moderate-excess synaptic glutamate release and subsequent receptor activation in vivo in ischemia-induced
neuronal damage.
The present study seeks to determine whether
moderate-excess synaptic release of endogenous glutamate
throughout the life span of an organism could lead to
increased ischemic tolerance, i.e., a preconditioning-like
state, and thus protect neurons from ischemia in an in
vivo model. We used transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress the gene for glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (Glud1)
only in neurons, not in glial cells, of the CNS. These Tg
mice are characterized by an increase in GLUD1 enzyme
levels and activity (Bao et al., 2009; Hascup et al., 2011),
relatively modest yet significant increases in brain glutamate concentrations (approximately 10–15% above wildtype [wt] littermates) throughout the life span (Bao et al.,
2009; Choi et al., 2014), and a moderate increase (30–
40% higher levels than normal) in depolarization-induced
synaptic glutamate release (Bao et al., 2009; Michaelis
et al., 2011). Unlike other models of excessive accumulation of extracellular glutamate (from 150% to approximately 30-fold increases in glutamate levels), because of
null mutations of glial glutamate transporters or of regulators of such transporters (Rothstein et al., 1996; Tanaka
et al., 1997; Zeng et al., 2007), the Glud1 Tg mice do not
suffer from massive neuronal damage in the brain or an
early death. Thus, Glud1 Tg mice offer a potentially good
model for probing the effect of moderately increased, pulsatile, chronic release of endogenous glutamate by neurons on the development of resistance to an ischemic
episode in adult and aged mice.
The current study tests the hypothesis that chronic
exposure of neurons to moderate levels of synaptically
released glutamate would activate protective pathways
that reduce damage after a stroke. Both gene ontology
and pathway analyses of whole-genome expression differences between Glud1 Tg and wt mice have identified
many genes that are related to glutamate and intracellular
signaling as being overexpressed in the Tg mice (Wang
et al., 2010, 2014). Some of these genes might lead to the
development of resistance to ischemia. The results of the
current study demonstrate that the Glud1 Tg mice are
more resistant to ischemia–reperfusion compared with wt
mice. To ascertain the potential molecular mechanisms
for the resistance to ischemia observed in the Glud1 Tg
mice, we explored the effect of glutamate hyperactivity
on the proteolytic activity of the 20S and the 26S proteasomes and of glutamate hyperactivity and ischemia on the
levels of ubiquitinated proteins. Proteasomal activity is

decreased, and ubiquitinated proteins accumulate following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; AlvesRodrigues et al., 1998; Keller et al., 2000a,b), whereas
intact proteasome activity is related to rapid ischemic tolerance (Meller et al., 2008). We hypothesized that, in the
Glud1 Tg mice, the proteasome activity might be elevated
and less affected by ischemia, thus providing relative neuroprotection from an ischemic episode. This hypothesis
was based, in part, on the observed increases in the
genomic expression of ubiquitin proteasome system
(UPS) enzymes in Glud1 Tg compared with wt mice
(Wang et al., 2010, 2014).
To assess the susceptibility of neurons to the injurious effects of ischemia in Tg and wt mice, the current
study examines the immunolabeling of neuronal cell
bodies and dendrites by antibodies to microtubuleassociated protein-2A (MAP2A). Acute glutamate- or
NMDA-induced neuronal damage manifests as dendrite
varicosities in neurons labeled with anti-MAP2A antibodies (Ikegaya et al., 2001; Hoskison et al., 2007). We have
previously shown that labeling with anti-MAP2A antibodies shows discontinuities in dendrites of 9-month-old
Glud1 Tg mice but without evidence of varicosities (Bao
et al., 2009).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of Glud1 Tg Mice
All experiments were conducted with the approval of the
University of Kansas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The Glud1 Tg mice were generated as described by
Bao et al. (2009). Briefly, linearized DNA containing the
cDNA of mouse GLUD1 was injected into fertilized C57BL6/
SJL hybrid mouse oocytes. The cDNA was placed under control of the neuron-specific enolase promoter (Bao et al., 2009).
The animals used in the present study were male, 9-month-old
Tg and wt mice. This age was selected because this is the age
when CNS transcriptomic and structural differences between
the Tg and wt are most significant (Bao et al., 2009; Wang
et al., 2010, 2014; Michaelis et al., 2011). In studies designed to
determine the effects of aging on ischemia-induced brain damage, 22-month-old mice were used.
In Vivo Ischemia Model
Reversible occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was
induced by using a well-established protocol (Clark et al.,
1997). The mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and
oxygen and maintained with 1.5% isoflurane, or to desired
anesthetic effect, throughout the procedure. Buprenorphine
was used as the analgesic and was injected preoperatively at a
dose of 0.05 mg/kg. Male mice were subjected to MCAO, followed by 24 hr of reperfusion. At the whole-brain level, 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate (TTC) staining was
used to assess brain damage (Ito et al., 1997). Brain edema volume (Vedema) was also measured from the coronal sections that
were stained by TTC by determining the volumes of both the
ipsilateral (affected) hemisphere (VIpsi) and the contralateral
hemisphere (Vcontra) by using the equation Vedema 5 Vcontra –
VIpsi (Yan et al., 2011).

Measurement of Proteasomal Activity
Brain tissues from 9-month-old wt and Tg mice were
homogenized, and 20 lg of the cell homogenate proteins was
incubated with proteasome activity assay buffer, in which their
ability to cleave the fluorogenic peptide substrate succinylLeuLeuValTyr-7-amino-4-methly-coumarin
(Suc-LLVYAMC) was determined (Figueiredo-Pereira et al., 1994). The
assay buffer used in the measurement of the 26S proteasome
function consisted of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2,
2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM ATP, and Suc-LLVY-AMC (80
lM in 1% dimethylsulfoxide; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
The buffer employed for the determination of 20S proteasome
function contained 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 0.5 mM EDTA,
0.03% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 80 lM Suc-LLVY-AMC.
The hydrolysis of Suc-LLVY-AMC into 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was detected with a fluorescence plate reader at ex
380 nm and em 440 nm.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunostaining and statistical analyses were performed by
using methods similar to those described elsewhere (Bao et al.,
2009), with minor modifications in the initial steps of preparation
of brain tissue following MCAO. Specifically, before fixation of
the hemisected brain tissue (ipsilateral vs. contralateral hemispheres), 2-mm coronal sections were obtained as described
above for assessment of the effects of MCAO on the brain at the
macroscopic level with TTC staining. For the confocal microscopy studies, the 2-mm coronal sections were fixed and permeJournal of Neuroscience Research

abilized and then subjected to rapid freezing and cryomicrotome
sectioning into 25-mm-thick sections. The cryotome sections
were incubated overnight in buffer containing a combination of
the primary antibodies against ubiquitin (polyclonal; rabbit;
1:250; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and against
MAP2A (mouse monoclonal; 1:250; Millipore, Billerica, MA).
The sections were subsequently rinsed in phosphate-buffered
saline and incubated with fluorescent dye-labeled secondary antibodies (Alexa 568 goat anti-rabbit and Alexa 488 goat antimouse) at 37 C for 2 hr. Cortical and hippocampal regions were
examined by confocal microscopy on a Leica SPE2 laser confocal
microscope. Pixel density counts were determined in the Leica
Application Suite software. The results reported are from the
hippocampus because the neuronal structure was frequently better preserved than in the cerebral cortex, albeit still showing
extensive damage. The averaged pixel densities from each sublayer of each region of the hippocampus, i.e., from the stratum
oriens, stratum pyramidale, and stratum radiatum of the CA1 and
CA3 regions, from three pairs of animals, were statistically analyzed and graphed.
Statistical Analysis
Student’s t-test and one-way or three-way ANOVA were
used to determine statistically significant differences in SigmaPlot 12.5. The level of significance was set at P  0.05.

RESULTS
Lower Brain Infarct and Edema Volume in Glud1
Tg vs. Wt Mouse Brain Following MCAO
Nine-month-old male wt and Tg mice were subjected to MCAO, followed by 24 hr of reperfusion. The
extent of brain damage was assessed with TTC staining.
The reduction of TTC by dehydrogenases in living cells
leads to the formation of water-insoluble red formazan
crystals, which outline the area and volume of surviving
tissue. This method can be used to determine percentage
infarct size (Ito et al., 1997). The results revealed that the
Glud1 Tg mice had a 30% decrease in infarct volume
compared with the wt cohorts (Fig. 1B). Brain edema
volume was measured with 2-mm coronal sections by
determining the difference between the volumes of both
the ipsilateral hemisphere and the contralateral hemisphere. As shown in Figure 1C, the Glud1 Tg mice had a
significantly lower edema volume following MCAO than
the wt mice. Together, these results support the hypothesis that chronic exposure to moderate levels of glutamate
released at synapses can protect against an ischemic insult.
Increased Basal Levels of Proteasomal Activity
in the Brain of Glud1 Tg vs. Wt Mice
Next, we attempted to define molecular components
of the adaptive mechanisms that allowed the Glud1 Tg
mice to be more resistant to ischemia. The UPS plays an
essential role in ischemic tolerance (Meller et al., 2008;
Meller, 2009). To identify whether differences in the UPS
between Tg and wt mice might account for the observed
differential sensitivity to ischemia in these two types of

way ANOVA, Holm-Sidak post hoc pairwise comparisons; data not shown). The same was also true for the
levels of immune reactivity under baseline conditions.
The lack of differential labeling between wt and Tg
mice matched the observations reported previously for
9-month-old Glud1 Tg and wt hippocampus (Bao et al.,
2009).

Activities of the 26S (A) and 20S (B) proteasomes were assayed by

mice, we measured the proteasomal activities in brain tissue
of the Glud1 Tg and wt cohorts. Brain tissue from 9month-old wt and Tg mice that had not been subjected to
MCAO was homogenized, and proteasomal function was
assessed. An ATP-free assay buffer was used to differentiate
20S proteasomal function from 26S proteasomal function.
We found that basal proteasomal activities of both the 26S
and the 20S proteasome (i.e., in the absence of any prior
treatment) were significantly elevated in the Glud1 Tg
mice compared with those in wt mice (Fig. 2).
Ubiquitin Labeling in Hippocampus Following
MCAO in Tg and Wt Mice
The higher activity of the 26S and 20S proteasomes
in Glud1 Tg vs. wt mouse brain fits with the previously
observed elevated gene expression of UPS enzymes in the
Tg mouse hippocampus (Wang et al., 2010). Increases in
UPS mRNA levels, as shown in the present study in the
proteasome activity in Glud1 Tg mice, might represent
adaptive responses to increases in the levels of damaged
proteins brought about by glutamate hyperstimulation of
neurons in these mice. Overall increases in the activity of
the UPS might account for the delayed appearance of a
significant accumulation of ubiquitin protein aggregates
in brain neurons of Glud1 mice that is observed at about
the age of 16–20 months (Bao et al., 2009). However,
ischemia–reperfusion, we reasoned, might cause an
increased burden in terms of damaged proteins in both wt
and Tg mice (Alves-Rodrigues et al., 1998; Keller et al.,
2000b). The effect of ischemia–reperfusion on ubiquitinated protein accumulation and proteasome degradation
might be expected to be greater in the Tg than in the wt
mouse, but these mice might have adapted to the
increased burden of ubiquitinated proteins. We examined
the levels of immunolabeled ubiquitinated proteins in
brain sections from Glud1 Tg and wt mice, both under
baseline conditions and following cerebral artery occlusion. In contrast to our expectation, there were no significant differences in overall immunolabeling of ubiquitin or
ubiquitinated proteins in neurons of either the CA1 or
the CA3 region of the hippocampus of Tg and wt mice
subjected to ischemia (P > 0.05 for all comparisons, one-

Increased MAP2A Labeling in the Hippocampus of
the Glud1 Tg Mice Following MCAO
MAP2 is a microtubule-associated protein that is
critical for the maintenance of normal cytoskeletal architecture in neurons and for the overall function of neurons
(Yan et al., 2010). MAP2 is localized in cell bodies and
dendrites and is a useful marker of surviving neurons and
a probe of dendrite structure (Ikegaya et al., 2001; Hoskison et al., 2007; Bao et al., 2009). In a previous study of
9-month-old Glud1 Tg mice, it was noted that the hyperglutamatergic state in the brain of the Tg animals led to a
diminution of MAP2A labeling by the anti-MAP2A antibodies, whereas the structure of dendrites remained relatively well preserved (Bao et al., 2009). These changes
were attributed to a possible disruption of either MAP2A
mRNA transport to, or suppression of protein synthesis

within, the dendrites (Rehbein et al., 2000). In the present study, under baseline conditions, we observed a significant reduction in overall MAP2A labeling in both cell
bodies and dendrites and in both CA1 and CA3 regions
of the hippocampus of the Glud1 Tg compared with that
of the wt mice (Figs. 3, 4). After the induction of ischemia–reperfusion, the labeling of MAP2A in neuronal cell
bodies and dendrites of the Tg mice was markedly
enhanced above that observed at baseline, whereas the
labeling of the hippocampal neurons in wt mice was
markedly reduced in both the ipsilateral and the contralateral CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions (Figs. 5, 6).
Lower Brain Infarct and Edema Volume in Aged
Glud1 Tg Mice vs. Wt Mice
Focal ischemia leads to increases in infarct volume
in aged animals (Davis et al., 1995; Sutherland et al.,
1996), and the effectiveness of preconditioning for inducing protection against severe ischemia has been reported
to decrease with advancing age (He et al., 2005). To
determine whether the relative ischemia tolerance
observed in our model of glutamate preconditioning, i.e.,
the Glud1 mice, was altered by aging, we determined
brain damage (infarct and edema volumes) in 22-monthold Tg and wt mice after MCAO and reperfusion. Figure
7 shows that the Glud1 Tg mice at 22 months of age
were protected in terms of decreases in infarct and edema
volumes compared with their age-matched wt counterparts (P < 0.005). Statistical analyses showed that there
were no significant differences between the 22-monthold and the 8-month-old mice of the same genotype.
DISCUSSION
The key observation made in the present study was that
either adult or aged Glud1 Tg mice exhibited significantly
greater resistance to ischemia–reperfusion than wt mice of

the same age. The mechanisms for such tolerance to the
effects of ischemia–reperfusion are still unknown. The first
mechanism considered in the present study was that of a
proteasome-mediated resistance to ischemia–reperfusion.
It is known that excess glutamate can induce the
formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS; Armstead
et al., 1989; Duchen, 2000; Kahlert et al., 2005; Parfenova et al., 2006) and that ROS can alter proteasome
activities (Ullrich et al., 1999; Ding et al., 2003; Grune
et al., 2004; Aiken et al., 2011). The proteasome proteolytic pathways represent the main mechanisms responsible for the degradation of damaged or unwanted
proteins. These pathways play an important role in
maintaining normal cellular homeostasis, given that null
mutants for the proteasome subunits result in lethal phenotypes (Heinemeyer et al., 1991; Orlowski, 1999). Protein unfolding and aggregation are also dominant
pathogenic events in vulnerable ischemic neurons (Ge
et al., 2007). A study by Liu et al. (2005) showed that
ischemic preconditioning alleviates protein aggregation
in neurons. Whether this reduction is due to a decrease
in overall cell damage or is the result of an enhanced
ability by neurons tolerant to ischemia in eliminating the
irreparably damaged proteins has yet to be elucidated.
Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that chronic exposure of neurons to increased levels of synaptic glutamate
release, i.e., glutamate preconditioning, might lead to an
increase in proteasome activity. Significant increases
were observed in both the 20S and the 26S baseline proteasome activities in Glud1 mouse brains compared with
those of wt mice. Ubiquitination is a key step in the
degradation process of many proteins. Contrary to our
hypothesis that elevated proteasomal activity would lead
to decreases in ubiquitinated proteins following an episode of ischemia–reperfusion, no difference was
observed in the level of ubiquitin immunoreactivity following ischemia–reperfusion in hippocampal neurons of
the Tg compared with the wt mice. In summary, the
increase of the proteasome activities but not of ubiquitination suggests that the proteasomal degradation pathways are involved in the neuroprotective effect of
chronic glutamate synaptic release.
The molecular dynamics that lead to increases in
proteasome activity in the Glud1 mice are not known.
After an episode of stroke, the loss of ATP impairs the
activity of the 26S proteasome (Keller et al., 2000b). The
26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent protease composed
of a core proteinase, the 20S proteasome, and two PA700
regulatory particles (the 19S complex) on both ends
(Coux et al., 1996). These subunits associate and dissociate in an ATP-dependent manner; thus, conditions of
decreased ATP levels would bring about the dissociation
of the subunits (Tanahashi et al., 2000). After transient
forebrain ischemia, the ATP-dependent reassociation of
the 20S catalytic and the PA700 regulatory subunits to
form the 26S proteasome is severely impaired in the hippocampus (Asai et al., 2002). The increased baseline proteasome activity in Glud1 mouse brains might offer
relative resistance to the ischemia-induced loss of ATP.

However, the present studies did not link the protective
effect of chronic glutamate synaptic release in the brain to
the activation of proteasome degradation of proteins.

levels in Tg and wt hippocampus were among the most
remarkable differential characteristics observed. MAPs are
key regulators of neuronal morphogenesis (Popa-Wagner
et al., 1999). The so-called late MAPs, MAP2A and
MAP2B, have a profound effect on the organization of
cellular microtubules (Lewis et al., 1989), provide structural stabilization during process outgrowth (Chen et al.,
1992), and assist in the maintenance of proper synaptic
circuitry in the mature brain (Marsden et al., 1996; PopaWagner et al., 1999). MAP2A is preferentially associated
with dendritic processes (Binder et al., 1986). Stress conditions can alter MAP2 levels in the brain cortex and hippocampus (Yan et al., 2010), and MAP2 localization and
protein levels are disrupted in response to the stress
induced by high extracellular glutamate levels (Arias et al.,
1997). Cerebral ischemia reduces MAP2 immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and the cortex of both neonatal
rats (Malinak and Silverstein, 1996) and adult rats (Kitagawa et al., 1989; Dawson and Hallenbeck, 1996). The
most significant loss of MAP2 following ischemia is in the
CA1 region in both rats (Inuzuka et al., 1990) and gerbils
(Yoshimi et al., 1991). The susceptibility of MAP2 to
ischemia and excitotoxicity has been attributed to the elevation of intracellular Ca21 concentrations that lead to
rapid MAP2 proteolysis by calcium-activated proteinases
(Kitagawa et al., 1989). However, some authors have
reported that MAP2 levels in the penumbra surrounding

the core of the ischemic lesion as well as in surviving neurons at the core of ischemic tissue are increased rather
than decreased (Li et al., 1998). The same is true for
MAP2 levels following episodes of severe epileptic seizures in rats (Jalava et al., 2007). Thus, under conditions of
increased glutamate release to the extracellular environment of neurons, i.e., ischemic penumbra and postictal
state, certain neuronal populations respond to the stress by
increasing the intracellular levels of MAP2 proteins.
In our studies, we observed that, after MCAO,
MAP2A was significantly increased in the CA1 region of
the Glud1 Tg mice compared with the wt littermates.
This striking increase in MAP2 immunolabeling is more
likely a result of increased protein levels and not an
increase in the number of dendritic processes. This suggests that, unlike the wt mice, the Glud1 Tg mice may
have a preserved ability to synthesize some of the components required for structural repair and maintenance
(Popa-Wagner et al., 1999). Because some MAP2 is synthesized in the cell body and then transported to dendrites
(Okabe and Hirokawa, 1989), whereas a substantial
amount of MAP2A is synthesized in dendrites from
mRNA that has been transported to dendritic sites
(Rehbein et al., 2000), it appears that the Glud1 Tg mice
have improved protein and mRNA transport processes
that lead to enhanced recovery following cerebral ischemia. In more recent studies, we have observed significant

increases in the levels of proteins involved in the transport
of membrane-bound organelles in neurons, in the kinesins, in mRNA levels for these proteins, and in overall
axoplasmic transport in Tg vs. wt neurons (P. Lee et al.,
submitted for publication). Therefore, the possibility that
neurons from the hyperglutamatergic mice might recover
more readily the transport of particle-bound mRNA and
local synthesis of MAP2A than neurons from wt mice
seems possible but must be examined in greater detail in
future studies.
Previous studies have demonstrated that the degree
of preconditioning-induced protection is significantly
diminished in aged rats (Fenton et al., 2000; He et al.,
2005). In humans, transient ischemic attacks (TIA) were
found to be neuroprotective against ischemic strokes.
However, the protective mechanisms of TIA were not
present in patients over the age of 65 years (Della Morte
et al., 2008). To determine whether the tolerance induced
by glutamate preconditioning was preserved in aged mice,
we evaluated brain infarct size in 22-month-old Glud1 Tg
mice after MCAO and reperfusion. We showed that glutamate preconditioning was at least as, if not more, effective in the aged (22-month-old) compared with the
young adult (9-month-old) mice. This was consistent
with the results of another study in which gerbils, preconditioned with 1.5 min of ischemia before a subsequent 5min occlusion of both carotid arteries (global ischemia),
exhibited differential levels of resistance to ischemia
(Dowden and Corbett, 1999). The young animals showed
53–67% protection of CA1 neurons, whereas the older
animals exhibited approximately 75% protection (Dowden and Corbett, 1999). The authors attributed this difference to the decrease in density and sensitivity of
NMDA receptors that occurs in the aged rodent brain
(Gonzales et al., 1991).
In conclusion, the phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning in the brain is well documented. This study
demonstrates, for the first time, that in vivo increased
synaptic release of glutamate can induce ischemic tolerance and maintain cell viability in young adult mice that
were subjected to cerebral artery occlusion. This protection was preserved in the aged 22-month-old mice. The
increase in MAP2 levels following ischemia–reperfusion
in the resistant Glud1 Tg mice may suggest an enhancement in protein synthesis and protein and mRNA transport to distal processes in these mice. Increases in
MAP2A synthesis and transport under conditions of
neuronal stress may be an important component of
the glutamate preconditioning process that leads to
ischemic tolerance and, potentially, to tolerance to other
stressful stimuli.
