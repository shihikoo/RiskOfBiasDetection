Abstract Previous studies have demonstrated that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase
(NOX)-mediated oxidative stress plays a key role in brain
injury following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) and
myosin regulatory light chain kinase (MLCK) has been
reported to be involved in NOX activation in lung endothelium. This study was performed to explore the correlation
between MLCK and NOX following cerebral I/R and the
underlying mechanisms. Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats were
subjected to 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion and 24 h
reperfusion to establish a model of focal cerebral I/R injury.
At the end of experiments, neurological function, infarct
volume, cellular apoptosis, activities of MLCK and NOX,
messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of NOX
(NOX1–NOX4), phosphorylation level of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC20) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
level were determined. The results showed that I/R treatment
led to increase in neurological deficit score, infarct volume
and cellular apoptosis, accompanied by the elevated activities

of MLCK and NOX, expressions of NOX2 and NOX4, levels
of phosphorylation MLC20 and H2O2, these effects were
attenuated by MLCK specific inhibitor (ML-7). NOX inhibitors (diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or apocynin) were
able to achieve similar results to that of ML-7 except no
effect on MLCK activity and MLC 20 phosphorylation.
These results suggest that activation of MLCK contributes
to cerebral I/R oxidative injury through upregulation of
NOX2 and NOX4 expression, which is involved in phosphorylation of MLC20.

Introduction
Stroke causes 9 % of all deaths around the world, and it is
the second most common cause of death after ischemic
heart disease (Donnan et al. 2008). According to American
Stroke Association, there are three types of stroke: ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and mini-stroke (usually
called transient ischemic attack). Among them, ischemic
stroke is the most common type and accounts for 87 % of
all stroke cases. So far, the first and essential strategy for
ischemic stroke treatment is to restore the blood flow by
means of thrombolysis or mechanical recanalization as
soon as possible (Xavier et al. 2012). However, in many
cases, reperfusion may further aggravate ischemic injury
(such as brain cell necrosis/apoptosis, neurological disorders), a phenomenon referred to as “cerebral reperfusion
injury” (Molina and Alvarez-Sabin 2009).

954

Despite intensive research, the mechanisms for cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury are still not fully elucidated.
Recently, there is growing evidence to suggest that oxidative
stress contributes greatly to brain cell injury following I/R
(Buch et al. 2012; Ma et al. 2013). Oxidative stress refers to
a steady-state level of oxidative damage in cell, tissue, or
organ due to over production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Potential sources of ROS in the body include enzymatic and metabolic pathways. Among the enzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases
(NOX) are considered as a major source of ROS production
in the central nervous system (Infanger et al. 2006; Yang et al.
2014). It has been reported that NOX expression and activity
is upregulated following cerebral I/R, accompanied by an increase in ROS generation and cerebral oxidative injury (Chen
et al. 2009; Kahles and Brandes 2013), suggesting that reduction of NOX-mediated oxidative stress may have potential
value in prevention of cerebral I/R injury.
Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is a serine/threoninespecific protein kinase that phosphorylates the myosin regulatory light chain (MLC20). So far, at least four isoforms
of MLCK are identified and three of them are muscle types,
including smooth muscle MLCK (smMLCK), skeletal
muscle (skMLCK), and cardiac muscle MLCK
(cmMLCK) (Shen et al. 2010). The remaining isoform
mainly exists in non-muscle cells, named as non-muscle
MLCK (nmMLCK, referred to MLCK in this study). Recently, MLCK was reported to be involved in many of
pathological processes such as intestinal barrier dysfunction (Guo et al. 2012), atherosclerosis, and lung inflammation injury (Mirzapoiazova et al. 2011; Sun et al. 2011). It
has been found that elevation of the phosphorylation level
of MLC20, the major substrate of MLCK, was closely correlated with cerebral I/R injury (Kawasaki et al. 2009; Yu
et al. 2012). However, the mechanisms underlying the role
of MLCK in brain I/R injury remain largely unknown.
Most recently, MLCK has been demonstrated to exert a
key role in ROS generation in lung endothelium and the
activation of endothelial NOX (Usatyuk et al. 2012). Based
on these reports as well as the above-mentioned role of
NOX in ROS generation and cerebral oxidative injury, we
speculate that MLCK may participate in regulation of NOX
expression and activation following cerebral I/R through
phosphorylation of MLC20.
In the present study, by using a rat model of focal cerebral
I/R injury, we evaluated the correlation between MLCK and
NOX-mediated cerebral oxidative injury and the possible link
between MLCK and NOX in ischemic brain. By using
MLCK-specific inhibitor (ML-7)[13] and NOX inhibitors
(apocynin or DPI), we demonstrated for the first time that
MLCK was involved in the regulation of NOX isoforms
(NOX2 and NOX4) expression through phosphorylation of
MLC20.

Materials and methods
Animals
Male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center, Xiangya School of
Medicine, Central South University, China. All animals received humane care in compliance with the “Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication, 8th edition,
2011), the Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments
(ARRIVE) guidelines and experiments were approved by the
Central South University Veterinary Medicine Animal Care
and Use Committee.
Rat model of transient cerebral I/R
The rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) as described previously (Ren et al. 2013). Briefly,
the rats were anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg,
i.p.). The left common carotid artery was exposed and clipped
with artery clamp. The external carotid artery was isolated and
ligatured. A nylon suture with a blunted tip (0.40 mm diameter) was introduced through a small incision in external carotid
artery and then into internal carotid artery. The middle cerebral
artery was occluded by nylon suture in the position of 18–
20 mm distal from a carotid bifurcation. The nylon suture
was left in place for 2 h and then withdrawn for reperfusion
for 24 h. The rats were returned to cage with free access to
water and food after incision was closed. Animals from the
sham group underwent the same procedure except that the
occluding filament was inserted only 7 mm above the carotid
bifurcation.
Experimental protocols
The animals were randomly allocated to seven groups (n=18
per group): (1) the control group (without surgery), (2) the
sham group (underwent surgical procedures but without ischemic insult), (3) the I/R group (subjected to 2 h of ischemia
followed by 24 h of reperfusion), (4) the ML-7 group (treated
with ML-7 (1 mg/kg, i.p., dissolved in normal saline) 1 h prior
to and 6 h after surgery) (Luh et al. 2010). ML-7 is a cellpermeable, potent and selective inhibitor of MLCK (Ki=
0.3 μM) (Yuan et al. 2002; Zhu et al. 2011), (5) the DPI group
(pretreated with DPI (1 mg/kg, s.c., dissolved in normal saline) 24 h and 30 min before surgery, respectively) (Zhang
et al. 2012), (6) the apocynin group (pretreated with apocynin
(50 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h and 30 min before surgery, respectively)
(Zhang et al. 2012), (7) the vehicle group (pretreated with
equal volume of apocynin vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)/normal saline=1:49, v/v, i.p.) 24 h and 30 min before
surgery, respectively). At the end of reperfusion, neurological

deficit score was assessed first, and then the brain tissues of
nine rats from each group were saved for infarct volume measurement, whereas the brain tissues (dissected from ischemic
boundary area) of the remaining nine rats from each group
were collected for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay or other
measurements (messenger RNA (mRNA)/protein expression,
activity of caspase-3, MLCK or NOX, and H2O2 content).
Neurological function assessment
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the functional consequences of focal cerebral ischemia injury were evaluated by
an investigator blinded to the experimental groups following a
5-point neurological deficit score (0=no deficit, 1=failure to
extent the left forepaw, 2=decreased grip strength of left forepaw, 3=circling to left by pulling the tail, 4=spontaneous
circling) (Schabitz et al. 2004).

Eclipse 80i, Tokyo, Japan). Two distinct patterns of TUNEL
staining cells were observed. Some were densely stained and
displayed clear apoptotic characteristics while others were
slightly stained and considered to be necrotic cells. Only the
former were counted as TUNEL-positive cells. Twenty random high-power fields in the ischemic boundary area from
each brain sample were chosen and blindly quantitated. The
total number of positively stained cells was counted and
expressed as cell numbers per square millimeter of brain
tissue.
Measurement of caspase-3 activity was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Beyotime, Shanghai,
China). In brief, 10 μl of brain tissue (dissections of ischemic
hemisphere) homogenates was mixed with 90 μl of reaction
solution containing caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-pNA) and
incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The absorbance was read at
405 nm. The enzyme activity was expressed as units per gram
of protein, and 1 U of enzyme was defined as the amount of
enzyme required to cleave 1.0 nmol Ac-DEVD-pNA/h at
37 °C.

The infarct volume was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. After neurological function assessment, the rats were killed under the condition of anesthesia. Brains were rapidly removed and were sliced into 2-mmthick coronal sections with the aid of a brain matrix. Sections
were stained with 2 % TTC for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by
overnight immersion in 4 % paraformaldehyde, then scanned
into a computer and measured with the imaging analysis software (Image J, NIH, USA). The presence or absence of infarction was determined by examining TTC stain. The infarct
volume (mm3) for each section was equal to infarct area
(mm2) multiplied by the section thickness (2~3 mm). The total
infarct volume for each brain was then calculated by summing
up the infarct volume of all sections. To minimize the effect of
edema on the accuracy of infarct volume measurement, the
final infarct volume was corrected by following equation:
corrected infarct volume= (contralateral hemisphere area
−(ipsilateral hemisphere area−total infarct area)×(thickness
of section+distance between sections)). Here, left hemisphere
refers to no-ischemic hemisphere of brain while right hemisphere refers to ischemic contralateral side (see definition in
Fig. 1b).

Measurement of activities of NOX and MLCK

Analysis of cellular apoptosis and caspase-3 activity

The procedure for H2O2 measurement was performed following the instructions provided by the supplier (Beyotime,
Hangzhou, China). Briefly, 50 μl of the supernatant of brain
tissue homogenates and 100 μl of work solutions were mixed
and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The change of
absorbance at 560 nm was monitored by a spectrophotometer.
The concentration of H2O2 was calculated according to a standard curve made from the standard solutions provided by the
supplier.

Cellular apoptosis in the brain tissue from different treatment
groups was analyzed by TUNEL assay. The procedure was
performed as per manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Nutley,
NJ, USA). TUNEL reaction mixture without terminal transferase served as a negative control. The brain slides were
examined microscopically at 200× magnification and
photographed by a high-resolution digital camera (Nikon

NOX activity was measured by a commercially available kit
(GENMED, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, the supernatant of brain tissue homogenates was incubated with oxidized cytochrome c in a quartz
cuvette at 30 °C for 3 min, and then the NOX substrate
(NADPH) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated
for 15 min. The change of absorbance at 550 nm was monitored by a spectrophotometer. NOX activity was estimated by
calculating cytochrome c reduction per minute.
An ELISA kit based on the principle of double-antibody
sandwich technique was used to measure MLCK activity following the protocol provided by the supplier (R&D Systems,
Minnesota, USA). Briefly, 10 μl of brain tissue homogenates
together with 40 μl of sample dilution was added to microtiter
plate well and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The absorbance
was read at 450 nm after adding stop solution. MLCK activity
of samples was calculated according to a standard curve made
from the standard solutions provided by the supplier.

Real-time PCR analysis

Western blot analysis

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to quantify mRNA level of NOX1, NOX2,
NOX3, and NOX4. Total RNA was extracted from brain
tissues by using TRIzol reagent (TakaRa, Dalian, China),
and the concentration and purity of RNA was determined
spectrophotometrically; 500 ng of RNA from each sample
was subjected to reverse transcription reaction by a commercial available kit (TakaRa, Dalian, China). Quantitative
analysis of mRNA expression was performed by using the
ABI 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, California, USA) with SYBR® Premix Ex
Taq™ (TakaRa, Dalian, China). PCR cycling conditions
were an initial incubation at 95 °C for 15 s, followed by
40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s, annealing, and
extension at 60 °C for 31 s. The real-time PCR primers for
NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, NOX4, and β-actin were displayed
in Table 1. Here, β-actin was served as a loading control.
Data analysis was performed by comparative Ct method
using the ABI software. Results were expressed as the
ratio of NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, or NOX4 mRNA to βactin mRNA.

Brain tissues were homogenized in ice-cool lysis buffer
and sonicated for approximately 1 min, then centrifuged
for 15 min at 15,000×g. For nuclear protein extraction, a
commercially available kit was used (Beyotime, Hangzhou, China). The protein concentration in homogenate
was determined by a BCA Protein Assay kit (Beyotime,
Hangzhou, China). Samples containing 40–60 μg of protein were subjected to 8 % SDS-PAGE gel and transferred
to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes and incubated with

1 % BSA for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes
were then incubated with primary antibodies against
NOX1 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), NOX2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), NOX4 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), pMLC20 (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher, Grand Island, NY,
USA), β-actin, or histone H3 (Beyotime, Hangzhou, China) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled
secondary antibodies. The signals of bands were measured
by Luminata™ Creseendo Western HRP Substrate
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) through Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS System (Bio-Rad, Philadelphia, USA).
The densitometric quantification was conducted with Image J.
Statistical analysis
SPSS software (version 19.0, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
was used for statistical analysis. Data were expressed as mean
±SEM. Differences in measured values among the multiple
groups were analyzed by the analysis of variance with
Bonferroni’s multiple-comparison tests. Differences were
considered significant when P<0.05.

Results
Inhibition of MLCK or NOX reduces neurological deficit
score, mortality rate, and infarct volume caused
by cerebral I/R
A 5-point rating scale of neurological deficit score is commonly used for assessment of neurological function in MCAO rat
model (Schabitz et al. 2004). Compared with the normal control group, there was no significant change in neurological
function and in mortality rate the sham group. Cerebral I/R
caused a significant increase in neurological deficit score and
mortality rate, these effects were reversed by treatment of ML7, a specific inhibitor of MLCK, or by DPI or apocynin, the
inhibitors of NOX (Fig. 1a; Tables 2 and 3). Whereas, the
vehicle of apocynin did not show such effect (Fig. 1a;
Tables 2 and 3).
Consistent with neurological function and mortality rate
change in each experimental group, there was no cerebral
infarction in both control and sham groups, whereas the
infarct volumes were 460± 100, 170± 29, 150 ±38, 160±
24, and 510 ± 130 mm 3 for the groups of ML-7, DPI,
apocynin, and vehicle, respectively (Fig. 1b, c). Compared
with the sham group, I/R caused significant cerebral infarction. Inhibition of MLCK by ML-7 or inhibition of NOX by
DPI or apocynin dramatically reversed the I/R-induced cerebral infarction. The vehicle treatment did not display such
neuroprotective effect.

Inhibition of MLCK or NOX reduces brain cell apoptosis
caused by cerebral I/R
As displayed in Fig. 2a, b, it is hard to see TUNEL-positive
cells in both control and sham groups. I/R injury significantly
increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells per square
centimeter; this increase was attenuated by inhibition of
MLCK by ML-7 or by inhibition of NOX by DPI or apocynin.
In agreement with the TUNEL data, I/R injury also significantly increased caspase-3 activity, another index for apoptosis, which was reversed ML-7, DPI, or apocynin (Fig. 2c). The
vehicle of apocynin has no such effect on apoptosis.
Effect of MLCK or NOX inhibitor on NOX expression
The mRNA and protein expression of four NOX isoforms
(NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, and NOX4) were measured by realtime PCR and Western blot, respectively. Compared with the
sham group, there was no significant change in NOX1 mRNA

and protein expression in the I/R group (Fig. 3). ML-7, DPI, or
apocynin treatment did not significantly affect NOX1 expression, too. Different from NOX1, the mRNA and protein expression of both NOX2 and NOX4 was dramatically upregulated in the I/R group, which was attenuated in the presence of
MLCK or NOX inhibitor (Figs. 4 and 5). The vehicle of
apocynin did not show such effect. As for NOX3, we only
obtained very weak signals for mRNA expression among all
experimental groups (data not shown), indicating that the level
of NOX3 expression could be ignored in brain tissues.

in the sham group. Cerebral I/R caused a significant
increase in NOX activity; this effect was impaired not
only by NOX inhibitor (DPI or apocynin) but also by
MLCK inhibitor (ML-7). In agreement with the changes
in NOX activity, H2O2 content, a NOX-derived product,
in I/R group was significantly increased. The I/R-induced H2O2 production was blocked by both NOX and
MLCK inhibitor (Fig. 6b). The vehicle of apocynin did
not show significant effect on NOX activity and H2O2
production.

MLCK activity; this effect was attenuated by MLCK
inhibitor (ML-7) as expected, whereas NOX inhibitor
(DPI or apocynin) has no such effect on MLCK activity.
Consistent with the changes in MLCK activity, the phosphorylation level of MLC20 was significantly elevated in
the I/R group, which was only reversed by MLCK inhibitor (ML-7) but not by NOX inhibitor (DPI or
apocynin) (Fig. 7b). Interestingly, the phosphorylation
level of MLC in nuclear protein was also significantly
elevated in the I/R group and was decreased in the presence of MLCK inhibitor (but not NOX inhibitor)
(Fig. 7c).

In this study, we evaluated the correlations between MLCK
and NOX-mediated cerebral oxidative injury and the underlying mechanisms behind them by using a rat model of focal
cerebral I/R injury. Our results clearly showed that neurological deficit score and brain injury (necrosis and apoptosis) was
dramatically increased in rats following cerebral I/R concomitant with the elevated activities of MLCK and NOX, levels of
NOX (NOX2 and NOX4) mRNA and protein expression,
phosphorylation level of MLC20, and contents of H2O2; these
effects were significantly attenuated by MLCK inhibitor (ML7). Except the effects on MLCK activity and p-MLC20 level,

NOX inhibitors (DPI or apocynin) displayed similar effects to
MLCK inhibitor. Considering lack of specific inhibitors of
NOX so far, we used two types of well-known NOX inhibitors, DPI and apocynin, to strengthen the role of NOXmediated oxidative stress in cerebral injury following I/R. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate
that MLCK may participate in NOX-mediated cerebral oxidative injury following I/R through regulation of MLC20 phosphorylation level.
It is well established that increased production of ROS is
one of the major causative factor for cerebral I/R injury and
NOX is a major source for ROS production (Buch et al. 2012;
Chen et al. 2009; Infanger et al. 2006). NOX family of NADP
H oxidases comprises seven members, denominated NOX1 to
NOX5, dual oxidase (Duox)-1, and Duox-2 (Kahles and Brandes 2013). Among these isoforms, Duox-1 and Duox-2 are
predominantly expressed in thyroid epithelial cells and

NOX5 was absent from the rodent (rat, mouse) genomes
(Bedard and Krause 2007; Fulton 2009). Therefore, we focused on the isoforms NOX from NOX1 to NOX4 in this
study. Except NOX3, we have found that the mRNA and
protein levels of NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 are detectable in
rat brain tissue under normal condition, indicating that NOX3
may play a minor role in brain function. Following cerebral
I/R, the mRNA and protein expression of NOX2 and NOX4
were dramatically upregulated while there was no significant
change in NOX1 expression (mRNA and protein) and NOX3
mRNA level was still neglectable. These results suggest it is
the isoform of NOX2 and/or NOX4 (not NOX1 and/or
NOX3) that plays a major role in NOX-mediated oxidative
stress during cerebral I/R.
The product of NOX2 is O2·−, which can be converted into
H2O2 by superoxide dismutase, whereas NOX4 is able to
produce H2O2 directly because of an extended E-loop within

this protein (Takac et al. 2011). We therefore examined H2O2
production in brain tissues to reflect the changes in NOX2 and
NOX4 expression. Consistently, H2O2 contents in brain tissues were dramatically increased following cerebral I/R,
which was attenuated in the presence of NOX inhibitors.
The role of NOX2 and NOX4 in mediation of cerebral oxidative injury was also confirmed in separate studies (Kahles and
Brandes 2013; Radermacher et al. 2013). For example, NOX2
deficient mice showed a reduction in the lesion volume, edema formation, ROS production, and neuronal death following
focal cerebral ischemia (Chen et al. 2011; De Silva et al.
2011). Similarly, mice deficient in NOX4 were protected from
oxidative stress, blood–brain-barrier leakage, and neuronal
apoptosis after transient cerebral ischemia (Kleinschnitz
et al. 2010). Collectively, the results from this study as well
as the literatures provided compelling evidence that NOX,
particularly NOX2 and NOX4, is an important source for
ROS production in brain tissue following cerebral I/R.
Although the activities of NOX have been found to be
upregulated under many pathological conditions, the underlying mechanisms behind NOX activation, particularly
at a gene level, remain poorly understood. Recently, it has
been reported that the phosphorylation level of MLC20, a
substrate of MLCK, was increased in ipsilateral cerebral

cortex compared with contralateral area in a rat model of
cerebral thrombosis (Kawasaki et al. 2009). In a rat model
of traumatic brain injury, pharmacological inhibition of
MLCK resulted in a reduction in p-MLC20 level and in
brain edema formation and intracranial hypertension (Luh
et al. 2010). The findings from these studies strongly indicated that MLCK participated in brain injury under multiple conditions through regulation of p-MLC20 level. More
recently, there was evidence to show that MLCK was involved in regulation of hyperoxia-induced NOX activation
and ROS generation by stimulation of MLC20 phosphorylation in cultured human pulmonary artery endothelial cells
(Usatyuk et al. 2012). Based on the literatures as well as the
results regarding NOX we mentioned earlier, it is reasonable to speculate that the increased NOX activity and expression in brain tissue following I/R might be involved in
MLCK activation and MLC20 phosphorylation. In the present study, we indeed found that following cerebral I/R, the
activity of MLCK and the level of p-MLC20 were significantly increased concomitant with the elevated NOX activity and NOX (NOX2 and NOX4) expression; these effects
were significantly attenuated in the presence of MLCK inhibitor. Expectedly, NOX inhibitors (DPI or apocynin) did
not affect and MLCK activity and p-MLC20 level. These

results indicate that MLCK locates the up-stream of NOX
and involves in regulation of NOX expression and ROS
generation.
Although our results provided evidence that MLCK participated in regulation of NOX mRNA and protein expression
through elevation of p-MLC20 level, the exact mechanisms are
still not clear. Recently, MLC20 has been found in the nuclei of
smooth muscle cells, referred to nuclear MLC20 (Li and Sarna
2009). It has been shown that nuclear MLC20 could function
as a transcription factor to regulate the expression of target
genes (such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1). The transcriptional activity might be determined by the phosphorylation status of nuclear MLC20 (Li and Sarna 2009). In this
study, we provided evidence for the first time that MLC20
was present in the nuclear protein extracts of brain tissues.
The changes in phosphorylation level of nuclear MLC20
matched well with the changes in NOX2 and NOX4 expression, supporting a role of transcription factor for nuclear
MLC20 in regulation of potential targeting genes (NOX2 and
NOX4) transcription. Nevertheless, more studies are needed
before drawing a firm conclusion.
In summary, the results presented in this study demonstrate
for the first time that activation of MLCK contributes to cerebral I/R oxidative injury through upregulation of NOX2 and
NOX4 expression, which is involved in phosphorylation of
MLC20.
