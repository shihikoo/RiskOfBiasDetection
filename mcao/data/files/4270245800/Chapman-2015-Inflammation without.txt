Ischemic stroke triggers neurogenesis from neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the subventricular zone
(SVZ) and migration of newly formed neuroblasts toward the damaged striatum where they differentiate to
mature neurons. Whether it is the injury per se or the associated inﬂammation that gives rise to this endogenous
neurogenic response is unknown. Here we showed that inﬂammation without corresponding neuronal loss
caused by intrastriatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection leads to striatal neurogenesis in rats comparable to
that after a 30 min middle cerebral artery occlusion, as characterized by striatal DCX+ neuroblast recruitment
and mature NeuN+/BrdU+ neuron formation. Using global gene expression analysis, changes in several factors
that could potentially regulate striatal neurogenesis were identiﬁed in microglia sorted from SVZ and striatum of
LPS-injected and stroke-subjected rats. Among the upregulated factors, one chemokine, CXCL13, was found to
promote neuroblast migration from neonatal mouse SVZ explants in vitro. However, neuroblast migration to
the striatum was not affected in constitutive CXCL13 receptor CXCR5−/− mice subjected to stroke. Infarct volume
and pro-inﬂammatory M1 microglia/macrophage density were increased in CXCR5−/− mice, suggesting that
microglia-derived CXCL13, acting through CXCR5, might be involved in neuroprotection following stroke. Our
ﬁndings raise the possibility that the inﬂammation accompanying an ischemic insult is the major inducer of
striatal neurogenesis after stroke.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke following cerebral artery occlusion is a leading cause
of chronic disability in humans, and effective treatment to promote
recovery is lacking. It is well established that neural stem/progenitor
cells (NSPCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult rodents continuously produce new neuroblasts that migrate into the injured striatum
for several months after stroke (Arvidsson et al., 2002; Thored et al.,
2006, 2007; Parent et al., 2002). These neuroblasts differentiate to
mature neurons, become integrated (Yamashita et al., 2006), project
to substantia nigra (Sun et al., 2012), and seem to be functional (Hou
et al., 2008). There is also evidence for enhanced SVZ cell proliferation
and neuroblast formation after stroke in humans (Macas et al., 2006;
Marti-Fabregas et al., 2010; Minger et al., 2007). The interest in this

potential self-repair mechanism was further increased by a recent
report showing that neuroblasts from SVZ enter striatum and become
interneurons in adult humans under normal conditions (Ernst et al.,
2014). However, in rats, only a fraction of stroke-induced neurons
survive long-term (Arvidsson et al., 2002), and it is unclear whether
they contribute to the spontaneous functional recovery after the insult
(Lagace, 2012).
Stroke is associated with inﬂammation, which exerts a complex
inﬂuence on several steps of striatal neurogenesis (Tobin et al.,
2014). Several months following stroke in rats, activated microglia/
macrophages continue to be localized in the ipsilateral SVZ concomitant
with the continuous production of new neuroblasts migrating into
the striatum (Thored et al., 2009). Factors released from activated
microglia/macrophages can either stimulate NSPC proliferation in the
SVZ, as with IGF-1 (Thored et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2006) and IL-15
(Gomez-Nicola et al., 2011), or in the case of TNF-α signaling through
TNF-R1, suppress it (Iosif et al., 2008). Activated microglia/macrophages
are also involved in directing neuroblasts to the damaged area by
secreting CXCL12 (Robin et al., 2006), MCP-1 (Yan et al., 2007),
and osteopontin (Yan et al., 2009). Finally, one study indicates that

inﬂammation associated with stroke contributes to the poor survival
of the new striatal neurons (Hoehn et al., 2005), similar to what has
been described for new hippocampal neurons in other inﬂammatory
environments (Ekdahl et al., 2003; Monje et al., 2003). The number of
recruited neuroblasts correlates with the volume of striatal injury
after stroke of different severities (Thored et al., 2006), but whether it
is the injury per se or the associated inﬂammation that induces striatal
neurogenesis is unknown.
We show here that inﬂammation without neuronal death,
evoked by intrastriatal LPS-injection, is sufﬁcient to trigger striatal
neurogenesis similar to that after stroke in rats. Using global gene
expression analysis on sorted rat microglia, we identiﬁed several
potential regulators of this response with changes observed both
after LPS and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). One of the
upregulated factors, CXCL13, improved migration of mouse SVZ
neuroblasts in vitro. However, knockout (KO) mice for CXCR5, the
receptor for CXCL13, showed no impairment of neuroblast migration after stroke but more extensive injury and pro-inﬂammatory
phenotype of microglia/macrophages.

The internal carotid artery (ICA) was temporarily occluded with a
microvascular clip. A small incision was made in the common carotid
and a heat-blunted nylon microﬁlament was advanced into the ICA
until resistance was felt (approx. 19 mm). Animals recovered from
anesthesia during the occlusion. 30 min after occlusion, animals were
re-anesthetized and the ﬁlament was withdrawn. Temperature was
maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C while animals were under anesthesia. Sham
surgeries were carried out in the same way but the ﬁlament was only
advanced 2 mm inside the ICA. MCAO animals that did not fulﬁll
predeﬁned inclusion criteria for successful 30 min occlusion (N40%
striatal damage; No cortical damage; No subarachnoid hemorrhage)
were excluded following NeuN staining. In mice, the procedure was
modiﬁed as follows: Right carotid arteries were isolated, and the
common carotid artery and the external carotid artery were ligated.
The ICA was temporarily occluded with a microvascular clip, and a
silicon-coated microﬁlament was placed into the external carotid artery
via a small incision and advanced into the ICA until resistance was
felt (approx. 9 mm). Occlusion was maintained for 35 min before the
ﬁlament was withdrawn.

2. Materials and methods
2.3. Immunohistochemistry
2.1. Animals and experimental design
All procedures were carried out in accordance with the guidelines
set by the Malmö-Lund Ethical Committee for the use of laboratory
animals, and were conducted in accordance with the European Union
directive on the subject of animal rights. Procedures were carried
out on male Wistar rats (250–300 g, Charles River, Germany),
male C57BL/6 J mice (25–30 g, Charles River, Germany), and male
CXCR5−/− mice (25–30 g, The Jackson Laboratory, http://jaxmice.
jax.org/strain/006659.html), housed under 12 h light/12 h dark
cycle with ad libitum access to food and water.
In order to characterize immunohistochemically the effect of LPS
and MCAO, rats were randomly assigned to one of 8 groups (n = 4–8
per group): LPS, vehicle (veh), 30 min MCAO or sham with either a 2 or
6 weeks recovery. Each animal was given intraperitoneal (i.p) injections
of BrdU (50 mg/kg, Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice
daily for 2 weeks beginning on the evening following surgery.
For analysis of the gene proﬁles in striatal or SVZ microglia, animals
were randomly assigned to LPS, MCAO or naïve groups. Due to low cell
numbers, notably in SVZ, each ‘n’ (4) comprised 3 pooled animals.
For examining the role of CXCL13 and its receptor CXCR5 in vivo,
wild-type and CXCR5−/− mice (n = 6 and 4, respectively) were subjected
to 35 min MCAO. Animals were sacriﬁced at 2 weeks after surgery.
2.2. Surgical procedures
Animals were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (3.5% induction; 1.5%
maintenance) in 70% N2O/30% O2. All animals received locally injected
lidocaine for pain relief. While under anesthesia and in the early
recovery period (2 h), animals were placed on a heat pad maintained
at 37 °C.
LPS from Salmonella enterica, serotype abortus equi (Sigma-Aldrich;
15 μg in 1.5 μl of artiﬁcial CSF (aCSF)) or vehicle (aCSF) was stereotaxically injected using a self-made glass microneedle ﬁxed to a gas-tight
syringe (Hamilton company) into the right striatum (coordinates:
1.2 mm rostral, 2.5 mm lateral to bregma, 4.5 mm ventral from brain
surface, toothbar at −3.3 mm) (Paxinos and Watson, 1998). In a pilot
experiment in mice, a dose–response curve was established with
0.01 to 100 μg LPS administered in ten-fold increasing concentrations
as above (coordinates: 0.9 mm rostral, 1.6 mm lateral to bregma and
3.5 mm ventral from brain surface, toothbar at 0 mm).
The intraluminal ﬁlament technique was used to induce transient
MCAO (Koizumi et al., 1986). In rats, the right carotid arteries were isolated and the common and external carotids were proximally ligated.

Rats and mice were deeply anesthetized with an overdose of
pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were post-ﬁxed overnight in 4% PFA,
placed in 20% sucrose for 24 h, and then cut into 8 series of 30 μm
thick coronal sections on dry ice. For each staining, one full series
was used. Fluorescence double-staining was used for visualization
of BrdU +/DCX +, BrdU +/NeuN +, Iba1 +/NeuN +, Iba1 +/Ki67 +,
Iba1 +/ED1 +, CD16/32 +/Iba1 +, DCX +/HuD +, DCX +/PDGFRα +,
DCX +/S100B and GFAP +/Nestin + cells.
All sections for BrdU staining were pre-treated with 1 M HCl
for 10 min at 65 °C and 20 min at room temperature. All double
stains were carried out according to the following protocol:
Free-ﬂoating sections were pre-incubated with the appropriate
serum and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C.
Sections were incubated for 2 h in the dark with secondary antibodies
conjugated with Cy3 or Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200, Molecular Probes, Life
Technologies), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat/goat anti-rabbit/donkey
anti-mouse (all 1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch), or biotinylated horse
anti-mouse/anti-goat (both 1:200, Vector Laboratories). The primary
antibodies used are listed in Table 1.
Single labeling for NeuN was performed with biotinylated horse
anti-mouse antibody and visualized with avidin–biotin–peroxidase
complex (Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories), followed by peroxidasecatalyzed diaminobenzidine reaction.

2.4. Microscopical analysis
All assessments were performed blinded to treatment conditions.
Neuronal death was assessed by an estimation of the total number of remaining NeuN + cells in the striatum using the optical fractionator
technique (West et al., 1991). This was carried out using the Computer
Assisted Stereological Toolbox (C.A.S.T-GRID) software (Olympus,
Denmark) as described previously (Arvidsson et al., 2003), but with
sampling from three coronal sections at approx + 0.9 mm, + 1.2 mm
(LPS injection site) and +1.5 mm from Bregma (Paxinos and Watson,
1998). In brief, images from the microscope were acquired with a digital
camera and displayed live on a monitor screen. Using a 1.25× objective,
the striatum was delineated on the screen according to predeﬁned
criteria: dorsal and lateral boundaries along the corpus callosum and
the medial sides of claustrum and dorsal endopiriform nucleus; ventral
boundary along a line drawn from the border of the dorsal endopiriform
nucleus at the level of the ﬂexure of the piriform cortex to the anterior
commissure, or at more caudal levels along a line following the posterior part of the anterior commissure; and the medial boundary along a
line drawn from the anterior commissure to the ventral tip of the lateral
ventricle and the lateral side of the ventricle, or at more caudal levels
along the lateral side of globus pallidus and the lateral side of the lateral
ventricle. The thickness of each section was measured at high magniﬁcation at multiple locations within the delineated striatum using a
microcator attached to the stage of the microscope. The striatum
was then systematically sampled at high magniﬁcation and cells at
each sampling point were counted using a three-dimensional probe
(counting frame combined with optical dissector) following accepted
stereological cell counting methods (Gundersen, 1978; West, 1999).
Counting frame area and stepping distances were chosen to sample
100–200 cells per striatum, keeping the number of cells counted at
each sampling point as close to 1 as possible. Number of cells per
striatum was calculated by dividing the number of cells counted with
the sampling fraction. Images of SVZ in sections with NeuN and cresyl
violet staining from the same aforementioned rostrocaudal levels
were ﬁrst taken under 40 × magniﬁcation. The SVZ was then deﬁned
by cells stained only with cresyl violet and area was measured
using Visiopharm software (Visiopharm, Denmark). For volume
measurement, striatum was ﬁrst delineated using the pre-deﬁned
criteria described above. Area was then measured using Visiopharm
software (Visiopharm, Denmark) in coronal sections from + 2.2 mm
to −0.4 mm from bregma. Striatal volume was estimated by multiplying
the areas with the distance between sections (240 μm).
Numbers of Iba1+, BrdU+/DCX+, BrdU−/DCX+, BrdU+/NeuN+
single or double-labeled cells in the rat striatum were counted using a
0.0625 mm2 quadratic grid on an epiﬂuorescence microscope with a
40 × objective on the three coronal sections described above. Cell
counts are presented as the total number in these 3 sections. Because
striatal volume was decreased in MCAO animals (by 20% and 38% at 2
and 6 weeks after the insult, respectively, compared to sham groups),
the NeuN +, Iba1 +, BrdU +/DCX +, BrdU −/DCX + and BrdU +/
NeuN + cell counts in 3 coronal sections were, therefore, multiplied
with the shrinkage ratio to compensate for the effect of shrinkage on
cell density. The shrinkage ratio was calculated by dividing Iba1+ cell
density in all striatal sections (+ 2.2 mm to − 0.4 mm from bregma)
with Iba1 + cell density in the 3 coronal sections (+ 0.9 mm,
+1.2 mm and +1.5 mm from bregma). Distribution of cells was calculated as described previously (Thored et al., 2006). Additionally,
50 DCX + cells per animal were analyzed using epiﬂuorescence microscopy to assess co-expression with HuD, PDGFRα or S100β.
Since it was not feasible to count astrocyte numbers due to the
extensive astrogliosis seen in both MCAO and LPS-injected animals,
each animal was given a score of 0–3 by a blinded observer based on a
semi-quantitative scale of astrocyte activation as obverved by GFAP
and nestin staining: Score 0: Astrocytes appear branched and thin
with no aggregation; no double positive nestin/GFAP cells; no obvious

3

increase in astrocyte numbers compared to contralateral side. Score 1:
Some astrocytes exhibit a more swollen, ‘active’ phenotype but with
minimal aggregation; active astrocytes are limited to less than 1/3 of
striatum with only small increase in numbers; less than 1/3 of ‘active’
GFAP positive cells are nestin positive. Score 2: Astrocytes exhibit
‘active’ phenotype and aggregation, with clear increase in numbers;
more than 1/3 but less than 2/3 of ‘active’ GFAP positive cells are nestin
postive; activation localized or more diffuse. Score 3: Astrocytes exhibit
‘active’ phenotype and aggregation, with clear increase in numbers;
more than 2/3 of ‘active’ GFAP postive cells are nestin postive and
activation is widespread.
In mice, the quantiﬁcation of DCX + cell number/distribution,
microglia/macrophage density and infarct volume was performed in
three coronal sections at + 0.02, + 0.5, + 0.98 mm from bregma.
DCX + cell number/distribution was quantiﬁed using a 0.0625 mm2
quadratic grid on an epiﬂuorescence microscope with a 40 × objective.
Iba1+, Iba1+/ED1+, CD16/32+ (M1 marker) microglia/macrophage
densities were assessed by ﬁrst deﬁning the striatal region, and
counting positive cells using the Visiopharm software (Visiopharm,
Denmark), and then calculating cell density by dividing cell number
by striatal area. For infarct volume estimation, images of NeuN-DAB
stained sections were ﬁrst taken under 4 × magniﬁcation. Intact
areas identiﬁed by NeuN + cells in the ipsilateral and contralateral
hemispheres were delineated and then measured using Visiopharm
software. The area of unlesioned tissue in the ipsilateral hemisphere
was subtracted from that of the contralateral hemisphere to get infarct
area, and this area was subsequently multiplied by the distance
between the sections (240 μm) to get infarct volume.
Mouse and rat cells double-labeled with different markers
in epiﬂuorescence microscopy were randomly selected and
co-expression validated by confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss Jena
GmbH, Germany) using orthogonal views of single optical sections
from confocal Z-series.
2.5. Microglia isolation and ﬂow cytometry
Microglia were isolated according to a modiﬁed version of a
previously described method (Cardona et al., 2006). Rats or mice were
decapitated, brains were rapidly removed and placed in Leibovitz-15
(L-15) media. Brains were then placed in a brain matrix and cut into
1 mm coronal sections and the striatum and SVZ were then microdissected in L15 media. All solutions and instruments were kept
ice-cold until this point. In a laminar hood, tissue was diced and
re-suspended in a + 37 °C papain, neutral protease (dispase II),
DNAse (PPD) solution and incubated for 30 min at + 37 °C. The PPD
solution was prepared as follows: 2.5 U/ml papain (Worthington
Biochemical Corporation), 250 U/ml DNAse I (Worthington Biochemical
Corporation), and 1 U/ml dispase II (Roche) were dissolved in
DMEM containing 4.5 g/l glucose at + 37 °C, ﬁlter-sterilized and
stored at −20 °C prior to use. Tissue was then triturated, and excess
DMEM/F12 with glutamine (500 μl/50 ml) and 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) medium was added. Cells were washed by centrifugation,
re-suspended in medium and strained through a 40 μm strainer. Cells
were then re-centrifuged and re-suspended in 4 ml 37% percoll. 4 ml
70% percoll was slowly underlaid and 30% percoll added on top followed
by an additional 2 ml of media. A gradient was then run for 40 min,
200 ×g, +18 °C. Minimal acceleration and brake settings were
used. The thick viscous layer of debris formed was removed and the
halo-like ring of brain-microglia formed between the 70% and 37%
gradients was collected and washed by centrifugation in media.
Cells were then re-suspended in FACS block buffer (0.1% FBS in
PBS) with antibodies for 30 min at + 4 °C. For rat microglia sorting,
Allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated mouse anti-rat CD11b (1:100;
Life Technologies) and R-Phycoerythrin (RPE)-conjugated mouse
anti-rat CD45 (1:10; AbD Serotec) antibodies were used. For mouse microglia sorting, Brilliant Violet 421-conjugated rat anti-mouse/human

4

CD11b (1:200, BioLegend) and Brilliant Violet 510-conjugated rat
anti-mouse CD45 (1:20, BioLegend) antibodies were used. Cells were
then washed by centrifugation at + 4 °C and re-suspended in 400 μl
FACS buffer (1% BSA in PBS) to be ready for FACS sorting (BD FACSAria™
III, Becton Dickinson, Franklin lakes, NJ). 2 min prior to sorting, 2 μl
propidium iodide (PI) was added to the sample for the identiﬁcation
of dead cells. A minimum of 50 000 and 10 000 cells were collected
for striatum and SVZ samples, respectively. Cells were directly sorted
into RLT buffer (Qiagen) containing 1% beta-Mercaptoethanol and
were immediately frozen on powdered dry ice. RNA was extracted
from these isolated microglia with the micro RNeasy kit (Qiagen)
according to manufacturer's instructions.

and the SVZs were dissected from the lateral wall of the anterior horn of
the lateral ventricle and cut into small explants (approx. 100–200 μm
in diameter). These were then mixed with Matrigel (Corning) and
cultured in four-well dishes. After polymerization (25 min), 500 μL
of Neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27, N2-supplement, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (all from Gibco-Life Technologies)
were added. Cultures were maintained in a humidiﬁed, 5% CO2, 37 °C
incubator with mouse CXCL13 (2, 5, 10, or 20 μg/mL; R&D Systems) or
CXCL12 (50 ng/mL; R&D Systems). The length of migratory chains
was measured from the edge of the explants at three angles using
Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) after 24 h.
2.10. Statistical analysis

2.6. RNA extraction and quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissue using a RNeasy
Plus micro kit (Qiagen) or a RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen),
respectively, and then reversed to cDNA using a iScript Advanced
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-rad). For quantitative PCR, TaqMan Gene expression master mix (Life Technologies) and TaqMan probe for β-actin
and CXCL13 were used. The DNA band was examined after running in
a 2% agarose gel at 90 mV for 1 h.

Comparisons were performed using Prism 6 software (GraphPad
Software, Inc.) by one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's
post hoc test, or Student's unpaired t test. To achieve normal distribution
of data, counts of DCX+ cells in stroke and LPS-treated groups values
were subjected to log 10 transformation and parametric statistical
analysis was then performed. Data are presented as means ± SEM,
and differences are considered signiﬁcant at p b 0.05.
3. Results

2.7. GeneChip microarray assay
Sample preparation for microarray hybridization was carried out as
described in the NuGEN Ovation Pico WTA System V2 and Encore Biotin
Module manuals (NuGEN Technologies, Inc, San Carlos, CA). In brief, 2 to
10 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNA
in a two-step process, introducing a SPIA tag sequence. Good quality
of RNA and cDNA was conﬁrmed by the company performing microarray analysis (KFB—Center of Excellence for Fluorescent Bioanalytics,
Regensburg, Germany; www.kfb-regensburg.de). Bead-puriﬁed cDNA
was ampliﬁed by a SPIA ampliﬁcation reaction followed by an additional
bead puriﬁcation. 3.0 μg of SPIA cDNA were fragmented, terminally
biotin-labeled and hybridized to an Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.1 ST Array
Plate. For hybridization, washing, staining and scanning, an Affymetrix
GeneTitan® system was used (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA).
Sample processing was performed at an Affymetrix Service Provider
and Core Facility, “KFB—Center of Excellence for Fluorescent Bioanalytics”
(Regensburg, Germany; www.kfb-regensburg.de).
2.8. Global gene expression microarray analysis
Summarized probe set signals were calculated by the RMA
(Arvidsson et al., 2002) algorithm with the Affymetrix GeneChip
Expression Console Software. Average signal values, comparison
fold changes and signiﬁcance P values were calculated using affy
and limma package in R software by comparing SVZ/Striatum samples
of LPS or MCAO groups with that of naïve groups. Only genes with
changes greater than 1.5 fold and with an adjusted p value b 0.05
were identiﬁed. Genes coding secreted proteins were identiﬁed by
GO:0005576. Common upregulated or downregulated genes in SVZ
and striatum of LPS and MCAO groups were identiﬁed using VENNY
software (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html). Among
genes that were signiﬁcantly changed in striatal microglia sorted from
MCAO or LPS condition compared with Naïve one, we identiﬁed factors
that differed signiﬁcantly between MCAO and LPS conditions (p b 0.05)
and for which the fold difference was N1.5.
2.9. Migration assay and immunohistochemistry in SVZ explants
This procedure has been described elsewhere (Wang et al., 2012). In
brief, mouse pups were decapitated at postnatal days 4–5 (P4–P5),
brains were removed, placed in ice-cold L-15 medium and cut into
250 μm sections on a vibratome. Sections containing SVZ were collected

3.1. Intrastriatal LPS injection causes massive inﬂammation without
neuronal loss in rat striatum
We ﬁrst determined whether intracerebral administration of
LPS could induce microglia/macrophage activation without causing
neuronal cell death. In a pilot experiment, we injected different doses
of LPS ranging from 0.01 to 100 μg into mouse striatum. Substantial
microglia/macrophage activation without any neuronal death was
found in the striatum 2 weeks after injection of 10 μg LPS in mice
(data not shown). Because the neurogenic response after stroke is
more robust in rats, we wanted to explore whether inﬂammation
without injury could be triggered by LPS injection also in rats. We conﬁrmed that we could induce microglia/macrophage activation without
signiﬁcant neuronal death in the rat striatum using 15 μg LPS. At
2 weeks after LPS injection, there was a 2-fold increase in the total
number of Iba1 + microglia/macrophages compared to vehicle in rat
striatum (Fig. 1A, B). The difference between LPS and vehicle did not
remain at 6 weeks.
The degree of brain damage was assessed using stereological
methods to estimate the total number of NeuN + mature neurons
in the striatum. No signiﬁcant differences between LPS- and vehicleinjected animals were detected at either 2 or 6 weeks (Fig. 2A, B).
We did notice, however, in two out of eight LPS-injected animals a
thin line of neuronal death around the injection tract, which was
not observed in any of the vehicle-injected animals (data not
shown). We also measured stereologically the volume of the striatum in the animals injected with LPS and vehicle. We observed no
differences in striatal volume either between ipsi- and contralateral
sides in LPS-injected animals (15.9 ± 0.4 and 15.4 ± 0.4 mm3, respectively, at 2 weeks, and 14.4 ± 0.5 and 15.4 ± 0.7 mm3, respectively, at 6 weeks), or between LPS- and vehicle-injected animals
ipsilateral to the injection (15.9 ± 0.4 and 17.3 ± 0.4 mm3, respectively, at 2 weeks, and 14.4 ± 0.5 and 15.7 ± 0.4 mm3, respectively,
at 6 weeks). Striatal volume also did not differ between time points.
Taken together, these ﬁndings do not provide any evidence for a
signiﬁcant loss of striatal volume, possibly caused by degradation
of neuronal connections, after LPS injection.

Stroke was induced by 30 min MCAO and lead to injury conﬁned

methods, we detected a loss of mature NeuN+ neurons in the striatum
by 81.7% and 66.4% after MCAO compared to sham animals at 2 and 6
weeks, respectively (Fig. 2A, C). Iba1+ microglia/macrophage numbers
were markedly increased at 2 weeks after stroke, but at 6 weeks had
returned to sham levels (Fig. 1A, C). There was no difference in the
number of Iba1 + cells between LPS and MCAO groups either at 2 or
6 weeks (Fig. 1D).

We assessed the activation of astrocytes after stroke and LPS
injection using a semi-quantitative scale. At 2 weeks both MCAO and
LPS had induced a marked increase in astrocyte activation compared
with controls, which all scored zero (Fig. 1E). By 6 weeks, the level of
activation had decreased in both LPS and MCAO animals but had not
reached baseline levels. No differences in astrocyte activation scores
were observed between MCAO and LPS animals at either time-point.

For identifying newly generated cells, we used BrdU, which
was given to the animals during the ﬁrst two weeks after MCAO,
LPS injection or control procedures. Both MCAO and LPS gave rise
to the recruitment of large numbers of new DCX + neuroblasts into
the striatum (Fig. 3A–C), whereas only very few DCX + cells were
detected in animals subjected to sham surgery or vehicle injection.
At 2 weeks, the majority of the DCX + cells co-expressed BrdU,
indicating that they had been formed after the insults. The high
number of DCX + cells was maintained at 6 weeks in both MCAO
and LPS animals but at this time-point, 4 weeks after the cessation
of BrdU injections, only a minority of DCX + cells were also BrdU +.
Because DCX is expressed for only 2–3 weeks after neurons have
been formed (Brown et al., 2003), our ﬁndings indicate that following LPS injection there is, as shown previously after 2 h MCAO
(Thored et al., 2006), a long-lasting production of neuroblasts
entering the striatum. No differences in the number of DCX + cells
between MCAO and LPS animals were detected in the striatum either
at 2 or 6 weeks (Fig. 3D).
At both 2 and 6 weeks, the number of Ki67+ cells in SVZ was similar
to that in controls following both stroke and LPS injections (Fig. 3E).
Thus, we obtained no evidence of increased SVZ NSPC proliferation at

either of the two timepoints. However, whereas the area of SVZ was
increased in MCAO compared to sham-operated animals, consistent
with our previous report (Thored et al., 2006), we detected no difference in SVZ area between LPS- and vehicle-injected groups (Fig. 3F).
We did not observe any DCX + cells in the striatum which
co-expressed the oligodendrocyte progenitor marker PDGFRα or
the astrocyte marker S100β following LPS injection, conﬁrming
that the DCX + cells were of neuronal lineage. Moreover, using confocal microscopy, we found that 94% of randomly selected DCX +
cells also expressed the neuronal marker HuD (data not shown).
We explored whether the insults had given rise to the formation of
mature neurons by counting the number of NeuN +/BrdU + cells in
the striatum. At 2 weeks such cells were scarce but at 6 weeks a substantial number of NeuN+/BrdU+ cells were found in both stroke and LPS
groups (MCAO, 2 weeks: 6.01 ± 1.42, 6 weeks: 94.74 ± 49.43; LPS, 2
weeks: 0, 6 weeks: 34 ± 10.3, Fig. 4A–D). Thus, the neurogenic response
after MCAO and LPS injection leads to the formation of mature neurons
in the striatum. We estimated the percentage of neuroblasts giving rise
to mature neurons after stroke and LPS injection by calculating the ratio
between the number of NeuN +/BrdU + cells at 6 weeks and the
number of DCX +/BrdU + cells at 2 weeks. Interestingly, we found a

substantially higher ratio following stroke (20%) than after LPS
injection (5%), suggesting that the differentiation and/or survival of
the newly formed neuroblasts differ between the two inﬂammatory
environments.
Finally, we compared the migration within the striatum of new
neuroblasts and mature neurons generated after MCAO and LPS
injection. Both at 2 and 6 weeks after the insult, a higher percentage
of DCX+ cells were localized close to the SVZ in MCAO group compared
with LPS group (Fig. 5A, B). Similarly, more NeuN+/BrdU+ cells were
found close to the SVZ at 6 weeks in the stroke-affected than in the
LPS-injected rats (Fig. 5C). This reduction in neuroblast migration is
unlikely to be caused by the occurrence of a lesion in MCAO-subjected
rats, as there was no correlation between lesion size and the percentage
of DCX+ cells close to SVZ (2 week: r = −0.5362, p = 0.1707; 6 week:
r = 0.5161, p = 0.4839).
3.3. Inﬂammation after LPS injection and stroke is associated with changes
in microglia phenotype in both subventricular zone and striatum
We previously observed a long-lasting increase in microglia/
macrophage numbers in the SVZ following 2 h MCAO (Thored
et al., 2009). Here we found that following 30 min MCAO and LPS
injection, the number of Iba1 + microglia/macrophages in the SVZ
did not differ from sham and vehicle groups, respectively, at either
2 or 6 weeks (data not shown). We compared the morphological

characteristics of microglia between MCAO, LPS and respective controls
in both ipsilateral striatum and SVZ. Microglia were classiﬁed into one
of four increasingly activated phenotypic states: from ramiﬁed through
intermediate, and amoeboid to round (Lehrmann et al., 1997). In both
control groups, close to 100% of microglia were classiﬁed as ramiﬁed
at both time-points in both brain regions. In contrast, both MCAO and
LPS administration lead to a substantial switch toward the more activated amoeboid/round phenotypes in both striatum and SVZ at 2 weeks
(Fig. 6A–C). In both treatment groups, microglia/macrophages shifted
to a less activated proﬁle over time in the striatum, whereas the elevated levels of activation were virtually unchanged at 6 weeks in the SVZ.
Because of the difference between MCAO and LPS groups in the
survival/differentiation of the newly formed neurons at 6 weeks, we
also assessed the densities of pro-inﬂammatory microglia/macrophages
in the striatum. However, at both 2 and 6 weeks after stroke and LPSinjection, we found no difference between the two groups in the densities of iNOS+ pro-inﬂammatory M1 microglia/macrophages (MCAO, 2
weeks: 30.79 ± 19.49, 6 weeks: 2.51 ± 0.94; LPS, 2 weeks: 28.4 ±
6.49, 6 weeks: 4.16 ± 1.42 cells/mm2).
3.4. Microglia sorting and subsequent global gene expression analysis
identify potential regulators of stroke- and LPS-induced striatal neurogenesis
To identify microglia-derived factors that could potentially regulate
striatal neurogenesis after both MCAO and LPS-injection, we ﬁrst

puriﬁed, using percoll gradients and FACS, microglia from the SVZ and
striatum of naïve, MCAO and LPS-injected rat brains using CD45low
CD11b + as microglial markers 2 weeks after stroke and LPS injection. For the microglia/macrophages sorted from the striatum, 98.8%,
95.7% and 90% of the total number of CD11b + microglia/macrophages
were CD45lowCD11b + microglia in naïve, MCAO and LPS groups,
respectively (Fig. 7A). The RNA of sorted cells was then extracted and
microarray analysis was performed using Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.1 ST
Array. We hypothesized that genes coding for secreted factors that are
changed in microglia sorted from striatum and/or SVZ of both LPSinjected and MCAO-subjected rats could potentially regulate different
steps of neurogenesis. We identiﬁed several secreted protein-coding
genes that were either upregulated or downregulated in microglia
sorted from both SVZ and striatum (Table 2), only in microglia
sorted from SVZ (Table 3) or only in microglia sorted from striatum
(Table 4), in both MCAO-subjected and LPS-injected rats compared
to the naïve condition. We also identiﬁed genes in sorted striatal
microglia for which expression levels differed signiﬁcantly between
MCAO and LPS conditions (Table 5). Among the changed genes, we
focused on one factor, CXCL13, which was upregulated in microglia
sorted from both SVZ and striatum of both MCAO and LPS groups.
CXCL13 has been found to promote human neural progenitor cell
migration in vitro (Weiss et al., 2010). Moreover, since CXCL13
belongs to the same superfamily as CXCL12, a well-established stimulator of neuroblast migration (Thored et al., 2006), we hypothesized that
microglia-derived CXCL13 might induce striatal neuroblast migration
after MCAO. We conﬁrmed that Cxcl13 mRNA was also expressed on
CD45lowCD11b + microglia sorted from mouse striatum after stroke
(Fig. 7B), and then dissected the role of CXCL13 on neuroblast migration
using in vitro and in vivo mouse models (see below).
We were also interested in the expression of Cysteinyl leukotriene
receptor 1 (CysLT1) signaling molecules, since CysLT1 signaling has
been reported to be involved in regulating progenitor proliferation as
well as neurogenesis after traumatic brain injury in zebraﬁsh (Kyritsis
et al., 2012). To test whether signaling by Leukotriene C4 through

9

CysLT1 is involved in the neuroblast recruitment observed after MCAO
and LPS injection, we analyzed expession of Ltc4s, the gene coding the
enzyme LTC4S for LTC4 synthesis, in our microarray data. However, in
sorted SVZ rat microglia we found that the mRNA level of Ltc4s was
not changed in MCAO and downregulated in LPS compared with naïve
conditions. In striatum samples, Ltc4s mRNA level was downregulated
in both MCAO and LPS groups (Fig. 7C).
3.5. CXCL13 has a mild stimulatory effect on migration of subventricular
zone-derived neuroblasts in vitro but neuroblast recruitment and migration
in striatum are unimpaired in vivo in CXCR5−/− mice following stroke
In order to examine the role of CXCL13 on neuroblast migration, we
cultured SVZ explants from neonatal mice in the presence of CXCL13 or
CXCL12 (Fig. 8A). After a 24 h incubation, we measured the length of the
neuroblast migratory chains extending from the explants. CXCL13
increased chain length with doses higher than 5 μg/ml. We found that
CXCL12 was considerably more potent in this assay, inducing a similar
level of neuroblast migration at a dose of 50 ng/ml (Fig. 8B).
The in vitro migration assay indicated that CXCL13 might be involved
in neuroblast migration after stroke. While CXCL13 has been shown to
bind also to CXCR3, it is the only known ligand for CXCR5 (Jenh et al.,
2001). We therefore took advantage of CXCR5 knockout mice for
exploring the role of CXCL13–CXCR5 signaling in striatal neuroblast
migration in vivo. CXCR5−/− and wild-type mice were subjected to
35 min MCAO, which gives rise to ischemic injury in the striatum and
overlying cerebral cortex, and were sacriﬁced after 2 weeks. Because
CXCR5 has been reported to alter ventricular cell proliferation in
zebraﬁsh (Kizil et al., 2012), we analyzed cell proliferation in the SVZ
of the two animal groups following stroke. However, no differences in
number of Ki67+ cells were detected between ipsi- and contralateral
SVZ or between CXCR5−/− and wild-type mice (CXCR5−/−, ipsilateral:
805 ± 83.29, contralateral: 831 ± 26.64; wild-type, ipsilateral: 794 ±
37.15, contralateral: 721 ± 43.03). We also found that the deletion
of the Cxcr5 gene did not lead to any difference in the magnitude of

neuroblast recruitment to the striatum after stroke (CXCR5−/−: 201 ±
89.36, wild-type: 212.4 ± 40.79). We then counted the DCX + cell
distribution pattern in three different 250 μm wide columns extending
laterally from the SVZ. In contrast to in vitro data, we could not detect
any effect of deleting the Cxcr5 gene on neuroblast migration in vivo
(data not shown).
3.6. Ischemic injury and M1 density of microglia/macrophages in striatum
are increased in CXCR5−/− mice following stroke
Finally, we determined whether deletion of CXCR5 inﬂuenced the
size of the ischemic lesion and characteristics of the inﬂammatory
response following stroke. Interestingly, CXCR5−/− mice showed
a 45.5% larger injury volume compared to wild-type animals
(CXCR5 −/−: 11.64 ± 0.56 mm 3 , wild-type: 6.341 ± 1.67 mm3 ;
Fig. 9A). In both wild-type and CXCR5−/− mice, the ischemic lesion
extended to but never involved the SVZ (4 out of 6 wild-type mice,
2 out of 4 CXCR5−/− mice). In agreement, we detected no difference
in SVZ size between the two animal groups (wild-type: 0.074 ±
0.007, CXCR5 −/−: 0.071 ± 0.003, mm 2). There was no difference

between the two groups in the density of either Iba1+ or Iba1+/ED1+
microglia/macrophages in the ischemic striatum (CXCR5−/−, Iba1+:
1309 ± 137.6, Iba1+/ED1+: 357.2 ± 10.54; wild-type, Iba1+: 1452 ±
218.4, Iba1 +/ED1 +: 395.1 ± 81.36 cells/per mm2 ). We also
found no difference in astrocyte activation between wild-type
and CXCR5−/− mice using the semi-quantitative scale (wild-type:
1.889 ± 0.111, CXCR5−/−: 2.0 ± 0.136). However, in CXCR5−/− mice
we found a markedly higher density of CD16/32 + M1 microglia/
macrophages (CXCR5−/− : 868.8 ± 124.1, wild-type: 437.8 ±
99.07; Fig. 9B), almost all of which were Iba1 + (96%, Fig. 9C).
Thus, deletion of CXCR5 gene caused a more severe injury and a
more pro-inﬂammatory environment in the ischemic striatum.

4. Discussion
We show here that brain inﬂammation is sufﬁcient for inducing a
regenerative response from NSPCs located in the SVZ of the adult rodent
brain. LPS-induced striatal inﬂammation without neuronal loss
triggered the migration of neuroblasts into the striatum and their differentiation into mature neurons. The magnitude of neuroblast production
in response to inﬂammation was similar to that observed after a 30 min
MCAO, which caused major neuronal loss in the striatum. Stroke
and LPS-induced inﬂammation gave rise to a long-lasting (at least 6
weeks) recruitment of neuroblasts into the striatum, indicating that
the molecular mechanisms regulating the neurogenic response after
both insults are still operating at 6 weeks. It should be emphasized
that LPS and MCAO are known to trigger inﬂammation via different
mechanisms but through some overlapping signaling pathways. LPS
interacts with LPS-binding protein (LBP) to form LPS–LBP complex,
which is recognized by toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) with two co-receptors
(CD14 and MD2) leading to nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPK) and other signaling molecules
activation then induction of pro-inﬂammatory genes (Morris et al.,
2014). After stroke, on the other hand, various damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from dead cells are recognized
by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as TLRs and scavenger
receptors (Iadecola and Anrather, 2011). Activation of these receptors
triggers upregulation of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines

via NF-κB, MAPK, type I interferon and other signaling pathways (Chen
and Nunez, 2010).
We found that the level of microglia/macrophage activation, as
assessed by counts of Iba1 + cells, was similar after LPS and stroke.
After LPS injection and 30 min MCAO, we did not observe any increased
number of microglia/macrophages in the SVZ as previously shown after
2 h MCAO (Thored et al., 2009). In the striatum, microglia/macrophages
numbers were transiently increased at 2 weeks but had returned to
control levels at 6 weeks. The increased microglia/macrophage
activation in the striatum after both insults at 2 weeks had shifted to a
less activated proﬁle at 6 weeks, whereas activation was maintained
in the SVZ at this time-point. Moreover, our microarray data showed
that around 40% of the genes with signiﬁcant changes in microglia
from striatum and SVZ after LPS treatment are also altered in the same
direction after stroke, indicating partial similarity of microglia activation
pattern after LPS and MCAO. Based on these ﬁndings, we hypothesize
that also the inﬂammation associated with stroke could be essential
for triggering striatal neurogenesis. However, whether this is the case
has to be determined in future studies.
Cell proliferation in the SVZ was similar to control at both timepoints after stroke and LPS, probably because the increased proliferation
triggered by the insults had occurred before 2 weeks (Thored et al.,
2006; Zhang et al., 2004). The new neuroblasts migrated less in the
striatum in animals subjected to MCAO than in those given LPS
injection, with more cells remaining close to the SVZ. We obtained no
evidence that this was due to stroke-induced striatal injury hindering
the migration of neuroblasts. Interestingly, the microarray analysis indicated that both Ccl2, a factor previously reported to recruit neuroblasts
into ischemic striatum (Yan et al., 2007), and Cxcl13 (see below) had
higher expression level in microglia sorted from striatum after LPS
compared with MCAO condition (Table 5). Besides, the spatial arrangement of speciﬁc reactive astrocytes and their barrier formation and
secreted molecules might also contribute to the extent of migration of
SVZ neuroblasts (Wanner et al., 2013). Hypothetically, differences between MCAO and stroke in levels of chemokines recruiting neuroblasts
and the barrier characteristics of the astroglial response could underlie
the differences in migration of the newly formed neurons.
When we estimated the percentage of neuroblasts giving rise to
mature neurons after stroke and LPS delivery, we found substantially
higher value following stroke (20%) than after LPS (5%). Although the
inﬂammatory environments induced by LPS-injection and MCAO
share many common features, we also observed discrepancies that
most likely underlie the differences in differentiation/survival of the
newly formed neuroblasts and neurons. For example, the microarray
analysis provided evidence that the expression of the gene coding

IL-1β, a factor detrimental for neuronal survival (Rothwell, 2003), was
higher in microglia sorted from striatum of LPS-injected as compared
to those from MCAO-subjected rats. In contrast, gene expression of
IGF-1, a factor beneﬁcial for neuronal survival (Zheng et al., 2000),
was higher in microglia from striatum of stroke-affected compared
with LPS-injected rats (Table 5).
In agreement with our results, Kyritsis and collaborators (Kyritsis
et al., 2012) recently demonstrated that not only traumatic brain injury,
but also the induction of an inﬂammatory response without cell death,
gave rise to enhanced neurogenesis in the adult zebraﬁsh brain. LTC4
signaling was found to be the major mediator, and the injection of
LTC4 increased progenitor proliferation and neurogenesis. Importantly,
inﬂammation was shown to initiate the cellular regenerative response,
which was distinct from constitutive neurogenesis. Our study provides
the ﬁrst experimental evidence for a similar role of inﬂammation in
triggering neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain. It is unlikely
however, that this effect is mediated by LTC4 released from microglia
or other immune cells. First, our global gene expression data indicated
that the expression of the LTC4 synthase gene in sorted microglia
was either unchanged or decreased in the SVZ and striatum. Second,
whereas radial glial cells in the zebraﬁsh predominantly express the
CysLT1 receptor (Kyritsis et al., 2012), adult rat NSPCs express the
leukotriene receptor GPR17 but CysLT1 is undetectable (Huber et al.,
2011). Administering the CysLT1 antagonist Pranlukast in zebraﬁsh
reduced proliferation and neurogenesis (Kyritsis et al., 2012). In contrast, the inhibitor of GPR17 and CysLT1, Montelukast, strongly elevated
rat NSPCs proliferation in vitro (Huber et al., 2011).
We have focused on the role of microglia/macrophages, as a
continuation of our previous work (Thored et al., 2009), in which
we demonstrated long-term accumulation of microglia/macrophages
in the SVZ concomitant with persistent striatal neurogenesis after
stroke. However, the astrocyte activation as part of the neuroinﬂammation after both LPS and stroke could also be involved in the regulation of
neurogenesis. In line with this idea, Zamanian et al. found a core of gene
expression changes (166 genes with more than 2-fold upregulation) in
reactive mouse brain astrocytes, which were shared between ischemic
stroke and systemic LPS injections (Zamanian et al., 2012). Possibly,
such common changes could contribute to triggering the neurogenic
responses observed after both stroke and LPS.
The microarray data on sorted microglia from the SVZ and striatum
pointed to a number of secreted factors which were altered in both
MCAO and LPS conditions and could potentially act as regulators
of striatal neurogenesis. Several of the upregulated factors in both SVZ
and striatum have previously been reported to inﬂuence SVZ NSPC
proliferation/differentiation and adult neurogenesis (Table 2). For

example, FGF2 has been shown to maintain a slow-dividing neural stem
cell pool in adult mouse SVZ (Zheng et al., 2004). Another factor,
TNFSF12, inhibits adult mouse SVZ NSPC proliferation and promotes
neuronal differentiation (Scholzke et al., 2011). Moreover, Complement
3 (C3) knockout mice show decreased ischemia-induced neurogenesis
in SVZ (Rahpeymai et al., 2006). Among the downregulated genes
in both structures (Table 2), IL-6 has been demonstrated to inhibit
hippocampal neurogenesis in vitro (Monje et al., 2003), and SLIT2 was
identiﬁed as negative regulator of neurite growth (Byun et al., 2012).
If the gene changes are translated to the corresponding alterations in
protein levels, these factors could contribute to the occurrence of striatal
neurogenesis in both conditions. Interestingly, our microarray analysis
found that Timp1, a factor identiﬁed as inhibiting the Notch shedding
enzyme ADAM10 (Rapti et al., 2008; Muraguchi et al., 2007; Amour
et al., 2000), was upregulated in microglia sorted from the striatum of
LPS-injected and MCAO-subjected rats (Table 4). As Notch signaling
was recently shown to inhibit striatal neurogenesis from local
astrocytes in mice (Magnusson et al., 2014), our ﬁndings suggest
that microglia-derived factors might be involved in regulating this
neurogenic program in striatal astrocytes following stroke.
An upregulation of CXCL13 was detected in microglia isolated from
SVZ and striatum after both stroke and LPS. Previous studies have
shown that CXCL13 via its receptor CXCR5 is a potent chemokine for
recruitment of human neural precursor cells across brain endothelial

cells (Weiss et al., 2010). Moreover, neuroblastoma cells expressing
CXCR5 have been found to migrate toward CXCL13 in vitro (Airoldi
et al., 2008; Del Grosso et al., 2011). In accordance, we found that
CXCL13 promoted neuroblast migration from neonatal mouse SVZ
explants, although the effect was weaker than that of CXCL12, which
has been shown to promote neuroblast migration after stroke (Thored
et al., 2006). Inconsistent with the in vitro data, the number of
neuroblasts recruited from SVZ to the striatum and their migration
toward the injury following stroke did not differ between the
CXCR5−/− and wild-type mice. This is in contrast to a recent report
showing that intact CXCR5−/− mice exhibited increased numbers
of DCX+ cells but decreased proliferation in the dentate gyrus (Stuart
et al., 2014). Meanwhile, using immunohistochemistry we found that
CXCR5 protein co-localized with DCX in neuroblasts from P5 mouse
SVZ explants (data not shown), but we could not detect either CXCR5
mRNA using Q-PCR in DCX+ neuroblasts sorted from the SVZ of intact
DCX-GFP mice or CXCR5 protein on DCX + neuroblasts in SVZ of
adult mice subjected to stroke with immunohistochemistry (data not
shown). Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that CXCR5 expression
is reduced to undetectable levels in SVZ neuroblasts in adult mice, probably causing the discrepancies between our in vitro and in vivo results.
The CXCR5−/− mice exhibited a much larger ischemic injury in both
the striatum and cerebral cortex and had microglia/macrophages with a
more proinﬂammatory phenotype, illustrated by a higher M1 density,

compared to wild-type animals after stroke. CXCR5 is expressed on
virtually all B lymphocytes (Kim et al., 2001), and CXCL13 signaling
through CXCR5 is chemotactic for B lymphocytes and controls their circulation and redistribution in lymphoid organs (Legler et al., 1998;
Gunn et al., 1998). B lymphocytes are recruited to the ischemic
hemisphere after stroke (Ren et al., 2011; Lehmann et al., 2014), and
regulatory B cells secreting IL-10 have been reported to limit the infarct
volume and inhibit microglia/macrophage activation after MCAO in
mice (Ren et al., 2011). Based on the similar phenotype in CXCR5−/−
and B cell-deﬁcient μMT−/− mice after stroke (Ren et al., 2011),
it is tempting to speculate that the neuroprotective action of CXCL13–
CXCR5 signaling, for the ﬁrst time indicated by our ﬁndings, is mediated
by B cells.
Although previous studies have established that inﬂammation
can inﬂuence different steps of neurogenesis, i.e., cell proliferation,
migration, differentiation, survival and functional synaptic integration,
our study provides the ﬁrst experimental evidence that inﬂammation
per se triggers a neurogenic response in the mammalian brain. These
ﬁndings support the notion that the cross-talk between immune
cells and NSPCs and their progeny is of crucial importance for efﬁcient neuroregenerative responses following disease and damage in
the adult brain (Kokaia et al., 2012). Better understanding of the
molecular mechanisms involved in this dialog could provide novel
therapeutic targets to promote more efﬁcient repair of the damaged
and degenerated brain.
