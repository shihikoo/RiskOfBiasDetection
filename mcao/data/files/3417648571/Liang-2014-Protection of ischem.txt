Abstract
Background and Purpose: Accumulating evidences have demonstrated that nuclear factor kB/p65 plays a protective role in
the protection of ischemic preconditioning and detrimental role in lethal ischemia-induced programmed cell death
including apoptosis and autophagic death. However, its role in the protection of ischemic postconditioning is still unclear.
Methods: Rat MCAO model was used to produce transient focal ischemia. The procedure of ischemic postconditioning
consisted of three cycles of 30 seconds reperfusion/reocclusion of MCA. The volume of cerebral infarction was measured by
TTC staining and neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. Western blotting was used to analyze the changes in
protein levels of Caspase-3, NF-kB/p65, phosphor- NF-kB/p65, IkBa, phosphor- IkBa, Noxa, Bim and Bax between rats
treated with and without ischemic postconditioning. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to examine the
distribution of NF-kB/p65 and Noxa.
Results: Ischemic postconditioning made transient focal ischemia-induced infarct volume decrease obviously from
38.6%65.8% to 23.5%64.3%, and apoptosis rate reduce significantly from 46.5%66.2 to 29.6%65.3% at reperfusion 24 h
following 2 h focal cerebral ischemia. Western blotting analysis showed that ischemic postconditioning suppressed
markedly the reduction of NF-kB/p65 in cytoplasm, but elevated its content in nucleus either at reperfusion 6 h or 24 h.
Moreover, the decrease of IkBa and the increase of phosphorylated IkBa and phosphorylated NF-kB/p65 at indicated
reperfusion time were reversed by ischemic postconditioning. Correspondingly, proapoptotic proteins Caspase-3, cleaved
Caspase-3, Noxa, Bim and Bax were all mitigated significantly by ischemic postconditioning. Confocal microscopy revealed
that ischemic postconditioning not only attenuated ischemia-induced translocation of NF-kB/p65 from neuronal cytoplasm
to nucleus, but also inhibited the abnormal expression of proapoptotic protein Noxa within neurons.
Conclusions: We demonstrated in this study that the protection of ischemic postconditioning on neuronal apoptosis
caused by transient focal ischemia is associated with attenuation of the activation of NF-kB/p65 in neurons.

in cerebral ischemia [7]. Schneider et al found that transient
ischemia-induced brain damage and neuronal death reduced in
NF-kB/p50 deficient mice when compared with that in wild type
mice [8]. By contrast, inhibition of NF-kB/65 is found to underlie
the protective mechanism of many compounds against brain
damage caused by transient ischemia [9,10]. In resting cells, NFkB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to its
inhibitory IkB proteins. Under stress conditions such as ischemia
and hypoxia, IkB is phosphorylated by its kinase (IKK), which
leads to its degradation and disruption of the NF-kB/IkB
complex. The activated NF-kB translocates subsequently to
nucleus and binds to the kB promoter region of target genes [7].
Within neurons, NF-kB activation up-regulates the expression of
pro-apoptotic factors such as Noxa and Bim [11]. By contrast, the

Introduction
Ischemic stroke due to lack of cerebral blood supply is one of the
most common causes leading to death or disability in adults
worldwide [1]. Either animal study or clinical finding has revealed
that reperfusion following ischemia results in brain damage [2,3].
Since it was found that the activation of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB)
induced by transient ischemia is prior to DNA fragmentation [4],
accumulating evidences have demonstrated that NF-kB plays an
important role in regulating transient ischemia-induced neuronal
death [5,6]. NF-kB is a nuclear transcription factor comprising
five different proteins including p50, RelA/p65, c-Rel, RelB and
p52, of which RelA/p65 and p50 have been proved to be
responsible for the detrimental effect of NF-kB on neuronal injury

Ischemic Postconditioning and NF-kB/p65 Activation

activated NF-kB in glial cells could induce the production of
neuro-toxic cytokines such as IL-1b, TNF-a and IL-6, which
makes secondary injury to neurons [12]. Therefore, regulating the
activation of NF-kB has become the target to prevent neuronal
injury caused by transient cerebral ischemia.
Ischemic postconditioning, as a procedure consisting of series of
rapid intermittent interruptions of blood flow in the early phase of
reperfusion, is effective in protecting cerebral damage caused by
ischemia/reperfusion [13]. Both animal studies and clinical
investigation showed that ischemic postconditioning has protective
effects on transient ischemia-induced injury. Wang et al and Ren
et al reported respectively that ischemic postconditioning protected rat cerebral injury caused by either transient global or focal
ischemia [14,15]. Loukogeorgakis et al observed that ischemic
postconditioning attenuated endothelial injury secondary to
transient ischemia in human brachial artery [16]. Because ROS
(reactive oxygen species) is an important trigger of the activation of
NF-kB [17] and the protective effect of ischemic postconditioning
on ischemic brain injury is correlated with inhibition of oxidative
stress [18,19], we hypothesize that the neuro-protection produced
by ischemic postconditioning on transient ischemia-induced brain
damage and neuronal apoptosis might be via regulating the
activation of NF-kB. Therefore, in this study, we used rat model of
transient focal ischemia to investigate the effect of ischemic
postconditioning on the activation of NF-kB.

Ischemic postconditioning protocol
At the start of the study, the rats were assigned randomly into a
sham-operated group, an ischemia group and an ischemic
postconditioning group. The rats in the ischemia group and
ischemic postconditioning group were subjected to 2 h of focal
cerebral ischemia as described above. The rats in ischemia group
were subjected to 2 h of ischemia only, without any further
interruption of reperfusion. Ischemic postconditioning rats were
subjected to three cycles of 30 seconds/30 seconds reperfusion/
reocclusion after 2 h of ischemia. In sham group, rats were
subjected to the same procedures except for occlusion of the MCA.

Evaluation of neurological functional score
Neurological functional scores were evaluated at 24 hours post
reperfusion by randomly choosing six rats from each group by
staffs blinded to these groups. The test consists of two aspects of
neurological function as has been previously described [20]: (1) the
postural reflex test to examine upper body posture while the
animal is suspended by the tail; (2) the forelimb placing test to
examine sensorimotor integration in forelimb placing responses to
visual, tactile, and proprioceptive stimuli. Neurological function
was graded on a scale of 0 to 12 (normal score, 0; maximal score,
12).

Measurement of infarct size
At 24 h after reperfusion, seven rats from each group were
chosen randomly by staffs who were blinded to these rats, killed by
an overdose of pentobarbital i.p. and their brains were rapidly
removed. Infarct sizes were measured by staining with 2, 3, 5triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA). Brains were cut into 2-mm-thick coronal
sections in a cutting block and 6 slices were stained with 1% TTC
solution for 30 min at 37uC followed by overnight immersion in
4% paraformaldehyde. The percentage of brain infarct was
measured by normalizing to the entire brain tissue from the
animals, as described previously [18].

Materials and Methods
Animals
Adult male Wistar rats (weighing 280–300 g; 7 to 8 weeks of
age) supplied by Experimental Animal Center, Jilin University,
Changchun, China, were housed in a temperature-controlled
room (22–25uC) on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food
and water. All animal procedures were approved by the ethical
committee for animal experiments, Jilin University. All possible
measures were taken to reduce animal suffering and numbers of
animals in this study.

Brain tissue fixation

Surgical procedure

After rat was anesthetized, the thorax was opened and the heart
was disclosed. Herpin (0.1 mL, 300 IU/kg) was injected into the
left ventricle before the catheter was inserted into the main artery
via left atrium. Then, PBS was perfused into the vascular system at
4uC for 3 min, and PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde was perfused
at 4uC for another 3 min. Subsequently, the brain tissue was taken
out and put into PBS fixation solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde at 4uC. Twelve hours later, 20- mm and 50- mm
coronal brain slices were cut by vibrotome and the brain slices in
similarity were selected for TUNEL staining and immunohistochemistry labeling.

Brain ischemia was produced by using the middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) model in rats as described before [18].
Following overnight fast of the rats, anesthesia was induced with
intra-peritoneal administration of chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg). A
rectal probe was inserted and core temperature was maintained at
3760.5uC with a heating pad and lamp. A surgical incision was
made to expose the right common carotid artery (CCA), internal
carotid artery, and external carotid artery. The external carotid
artery was ligated proximal to the origin of any branches, such as
the occipital artery. The proximal CCA then was ligated and
temporarily closed proximal to the carotid bifurcation by a
microvascular clip. A small incision was made in the CCA. The
occlusion filament was inserted into the internal carotid artery
through the CCA 19 to 21 mm distal from the bifurcation to
occlude the origin of the MCA. The filament was prepared of
monofilament fishing line and covered with a distal cylinder of
silicon rubber (diameter 0.31 to 0.32 mm). After the MCAO was
performed, animals were allowed to awaken and resume
spontaneous breathing. Two hours after induction of ischemia,
the filament was withdrawn. After surgery, animals were then
placed into a cage to recover from anesthesia at room temperature
and were allowed food and drink.

TUNEL staining
TUNEL staining was performed at reperfusion 24 h by using In
Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Brain slices were postfixed 5 min in ethanol acetic acid (2:1) and rinsed. Then, the
sections were incubated in proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for 15 min,
followed by 10 min quenching in 3% hydrogen peroxide at room
temperature. After three 10 min washes in PBS, the slices were
incubated with TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 h at 37uC. Sections
were washed in PBS three times for 10 min each and color
development was performed in the dark with DAB (3,39diaminobenzidine). Hematoxylin was used for counter-staining,
and the slices were finally mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and

dried in dark room. TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells exhibited
brown nuclear or cytoplasmic staining. In three fields of 0.04 mm2
at the dorsal, ventral, and middle border of the infarct region at
the level of the anterior commissure, TUNEL-positive cells were
counted by a blinded pathologist and expressed as percent of total
cell count.

Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean 6 SD and were analysed by
SPSS statistical software, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for Windows. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used for statistical comparisons between the different groups. P,
0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Immunohistochemical analysis
The 50- mm brain slices were put into 24 wells plate with
500 mL citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and incubated in a 100uC water
bath for 10 min. After cooling down, the slices were washed with
the TBS solution containing 0.2% TX-100 for 10 min and
blocked in the TBS solution containing 3% BSA and 0.2% TX100 for 1 h at room temperature. Then they were incubated with
mixtures of primary antibodies at 4uC overnight. For NF-kB/p65
staining, the primary antibody mixture included 1:300 polyclonal
NF-kB/p65(Cell signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) and
1:600 monoclonal anti-NeuN (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA)
antibodies. For Noxa staining, the primary antibody mixture
contained 1:200 polyclonal Noxa (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
1:600 monoclonal anti-NeuN (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).
After washed up with TBS solution containing 0.1%TX-100 for
three times (10 min each) at room temperature, the antibodylabeled brain slices were incubated with 1% BSA containing 1:500
Alexa Fluor 594 Donkey Anti-mouse IgG(Cell signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA)for 1 h at room temperature. After the
brain slices were washed with TBS solution containing 0.1% TX100 for three times (10 min), they were incubated with 1:800
Alexa Fluor 488 Donkey Anti-rabbit IgG(Cell signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). Again, the brain slices were washed with
TBS solution containing 0.1% TX-100 for three times (10 min
each), and then were mounted on slides and dried in dark room.
Mounting medium was added on the slides prior to be covered
with coverslips for observing by a laser scanning confocal
microscope.

Results
Ischemic postconditioning reduced cerebral infarction
and neuronal apoptosis
In order to confirm the protection of the ischemic postconditioning procedure used in this study, we compared the infarct
volume between ischemia group and ischemic postconditioning
group. As shown in figure 1, the infarct volume at reperfusion 24 h
was 38.7%65.8% in ischemia group. By contrast, administration
of ischemic postconditioning made the infarct volume decrease
significantly to 23.6%64.4% (p,0.01, versus ischemia group).
This result indicated that 3 cycles of 30 seconds reperfusion/
reocclusion is an effective ischemic postconditioning procedure to
prevent brain injury. Moreover, neurological scores showed that
ischemic postconditioning significantly mitigated the damaged
neurological dysfunction caused by ischemia and reperfusion.
Because previous reports showed that transient ischemia leaded
to brain damage via apoptotic pathway [5], we compared the
differences in the apoptosis rate at reperfusion 24 h between
ischemia group and ischemic postconditioning group. As figure 2
showed, the apoptosis rate 4.6%61.5% in the sham group was
increased to 46.5%66.2% by 2 h focal ischemia and 24 h
reperfusion. However, ischemic postconditioning suppressed the
elevated apoptosis rate to 29.6%65.3% (p,0.01, versus ischemia
group). For further examining the inhibitory effect of ischemic
postconditioning on apoptosis, western blotting analysis was used
to investigate the expressional changes in Caspase-3. It was found
that ischemia/reperfusion induced cleavage of Caspase-3 was
attenuated by administration of ischemic postconditioning
(Figure 2 F and G). This result suggested the neuro-protection of
ischemic postconditioning against ischemic brain damage is via
inhibition of apoptosis.

Western blotting analysis
At reperfusion 6 h and 24 h, the brain tissues were isolated from
ischemic penumbra cortices and homogenized in ice cold buffer
(1.5 mmol/L Tris base-HCl pH 7.6, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.25 mol/
L sucrose, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1.25 mg/mL pepstatin A, 10 mg/mL
leupeptin, 2.5 mg/mL aproptonin, 0.5 mmol/L PMSF,
2.5 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.1 mol/L Na3VO4,
50 mmol/L NaF, and 2 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate). The
homogenates were centrifuged (10006g for 20 min at 4uC) and
the protein concentration of the supernatants (containing cytoplasm) and pellets (containing nucleus) was measured. Western
blot analysis was conducted with 10% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Four samples
(from four different rats) in every experimental group were used
for statistical analysis. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were probed with
the following primary antibodies: 1:800 anti-Noxa (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); 1:1000 anti-Caspase-3
(Abcam, Cambridge, MA,USA); 1:1000 anti-NF-kB/p65, 1:1000
anti-p-NF-kB/p65(Ser536), 1:1000 anti-Bim, 1:1000 anti-Bax,
1:1000 anti-IkBa, 1:1000 anti-p-IkBa, 1:1000 anti-Lamin B1 and
1:1000 anti-b-actin (Cell signaling Technology, Danvers, MA).
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA, USA). After being incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1: 2000), blots were washed and
immunoreactive proteins were visualized on a Kodak X-omat LS
film (Eastman Kodak Company, New Haven, CT, USA) with an

Ischemic postconditioning inhibited the translocation of
NF-kBp/65 in neurons.
When NF-kB/p65 is activated, it would translocate from
cytoplasm to nucleus to induce apoptosis [11] and its transcriptional activity is also regulated by its phosphorylation by serine/
threonine kinases[21]. Thus, we isolated cytoplasm fraction and
nucleus fraction by using differential centrifugation and analyzed
the protein level of NF-kB/p65 in each fraction by western
blotting. As shown in figure 3 A and B, when compared with sham
group, the protein level of NF-kB/p65 reduced in cytoplasm but
increased correspondingly in nucleus either at reperfusion 6 h or
24 h. Moreover, its content in nucleus increased with the
extension of reperfusion time from 6 h to 24 h. However, in the
ischemic postconditioning group, the elevation of NF-kB/p65 in
nucleus and its reduction in cytoplasm were both reversed
significantly when compared with those in ischemia group at each
indicated reperfusion time. Additionally, ischemic postconditioning significantly mitigated the phosphorylated level of NF-kB/p65
in both cytoplasm and nucleus induced by ischemia/reperfusion at
either reperfusion 6 h or 24 h, indicating the transcriptional
activity of NF-kB p65 was inhibited by ischemic postconditioning.

postconditioning. Therefore, our results indicated that ischemic
postconditioning attenuated ischemia/reperfusion-induced translocation of NF-kB from cytosol to nucleus within cortex neurons.

In order to clarify whether ischemic postconditioning inhibited the
translocation of neuronal NF-kB/p65 within neurons, we used
laser scanning confocal microscopy in combination with neuronspecific probe NeuN to observe the distribution of NF-kB/p65. As
shown in figure 3 C, the figures of nuclei were round and NF-kB/
p65 was located in cytoplasm in sham group. At reperfusion 24 h
following 2 h focal ischemia, nuclei shrank in some neurons and
NF-kB/p65 distributed mainly in nuclei. By contrast, these
changes in nuclei figures and distribution of NF-kB/p65 caused
by ischemia and reperfusion were partly reversed by ischemic

shown in figure 4, compared with sham group, the level of
phosphorylated IkBa increased significantly at reperfusion 6 h and
24 h, while the IkBa reduced markedly at each time point in
ischemia group. Moreover, the reduction of IkBa was concomitant with the elevation of its phosphorylation when reperfusion
time was extended from 6 h to 24 h. However, ischemic
postconditioning suppressed markedly the phosphorylation of
IkBa and maintained IkBa level in cytoplasm either at reperfusion
6 h or 24 h. This result indicated that the inhibitory effect of
ischemic postconditioning on the activation of NF-kB/p65 is
correlated with suppression of the phosphorylation of IkBa.

Ischemic postconditioning suppressed the expression of
proapoptotic proteins mediated by NF-kB
The expressional level of proapoptotic proteins Noxa, Bim and
Bax demonstrated to be regulated by activated NF-kB/p65 [7,23]
were investigated. As shown in figure 5 and figure 6, when
compared with sham group, the expressional levels of proapoptotic proteins Noxa, Bim and Bax were all up-regulated
markedly at both reperfusion 6 h and 24 h. Their expression at
reperfusion 24 h was higher than those at reperfusion 6 h,
respectively. However, the increased expressional levels of these
three proapoptotic proteins were all suppressed at each indicated
time by ischemic postconditioning. These results were consistent
with the changes in NF-kB level in the rats treated with ischemic
postconditioning, indicating that inhibition of the abnormal

Ischemic Postconditioning and NF-kB/p65 Activation

kB/p65 signaling pathway by matrine contributed to its protective
effect on neurons against cerebral focal ischemia [28]. Similarly,
the protection of hypothermia and electrical acupuncture on brain
damage was proved as well to be via modulating the activation of
NF-kB/p65 [29,30].Consistent with these reports, we not only
demonstrated that transient ischemia induced activation of NFkB/p65, but also found that ischemic postconditioning protects
neuronal apoptosis caused by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
via inhibiting of NF-kB/p65 activation.
It was reported that NF-kB/p65 could be activated in both
neurons and glial cells by transient ischemia, but their roles in
ischemic brain damage is different. Zhang et al demonstrated by
using transgenic mouse that ischemic damage is due to the
activation of neuronal NF-kB/p65, not the glial NF-kB/p65 [5].
However, it is thought that transient ischemia-induced activation
of NF-kB/p65 via toll like receptor 4 or 2 in glial cells would exert
secondary injury to neurons by producing neuro-toxic cytokins
such as TNFa and IL-1b [12]. In the present study, we
demonstrated by using double immuno-fluorescence staining that
ischemic postconditioning protects neuronal apoptosis via suppression of neuronal proapoptotic proteins. Although we did not
investigate the effect of ischemic postconditioning on the activation
of glial NF-kB, other researchers reported that ischemic postconditioning could inhibit the production of toxic cytokines TNFa
and IL-1b induced by ischemia [31]. We thus speculate that the
transient ischemia-induced activation of glial NF-kB/p65 might be
inhibited by ischemic postconditioning.
Activated NF-kB/p65 promotes apoptosis in neurons via
upregulating the expression of its downstream proapoptotic
proteins, such as nitric oxide synthase II [32], Bax[23], Noxa
and Bim[7]. Noxa and Bim are Bcl-2 family members, but only
contain BH3 (Bcl-2 homology domain 3)-only domain. They both
could activate Bax to release cytochrome c and other death signals
from mitochondria, and prevent Bax from being blocked by antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL [33]. Noxa and Bim have been
demonstrated to be associated with ischemic injury, because
previous reports showed that the expression of Bim and Noxa were

expression of these pro-apoptotic proteins was due to suppression
of NF-kB activation by ischemic postconditioning. Further, we
selected Noxa as a representative protein to investigate whether
ischemic postconditioning mitigates its abnormal expression within
neurons. As shown in figure 5, transient ischemia-induced
elevation in the expression of Noxa was located in the cells
labelled with neuron-specific probe NeuN. Obviously, administration of ischemic postconditioning mitigated the expression of
Noxa within neurons. Thus, these results suggests mitigation of the
expression of proapoptotic proteins Noxa, Bim and Bax is
associated with the inhibitory effect of ischemic postconditioning
on activation of NF-kB/p65.

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that ischemic postconditioning protected brain damage caused by transient focal
ischemia through attenuating apoptotic neurons. Its inhibition of
neuronal apoptosis was associated with suppressing ischemia/
reperfusion-induced activation of NF-kB/p65 by mitigating overphosphorylation of IkBa. Correspondingly, the expressional level
of proapoptotic proteins Noxa, Bim and Bax mediated by NF-kB/
p65 was reduced by ischemic postconditioning.
It has been found that NF-kB/p65 could be activated under
various noxious stresses to mature brain, which include transient
ischemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, neurotrauma and epilepsy
[5,24–26]. Accumulating evidences suggest that activated NF-kB/
p65 plays an important role in modulating cellular programmed
death such as apoptosis and autophagy-like death. Nakai et al
proved that activated NF-kB/p65 contributed to epilepsy-induced
neuronal apoptosis in rat striatum [26]. Zeng et al reported that
ischemia-induced activation of NF-kB/p65 aggravated myocardial
injury through the activation of Beclin 1-mediated autophagy [27].
In the case of transient ischemia, it is found that activation of NFkB/p65 is associated closely with neuronal damage [4,5], and
inhibition of the activation of NF-kB/p65 produces protection
against neuronal apoptosis. Xu et al proved that inhibition of NF-

rup-regulated at the ischemic heart and brain [34,11]. By contrast,
suppression of the expression of Noxa by antisense oligonucleotides rescued hypoxia-induced cell death and decreased infarct
volumes caused by focal cerebral ischemia [35]. In this study, we
proved that ischemic postconditioning reduced the abnormal
protein level of proapoptotic Noxa, Bim and Bax, which might
underlie the inhibitive mechanism of ischemic postconditioning on
neuronal apoptosis.
Despite it was reported that phosphorylation of NF-kB/p65 on
Serine 536 defines an IkBa-independent NF-kB pathway[36], the
activation of NF-kB/p65 is mainly regulated by its natural interior
inhibitor IkB. Xu et al demonstrated by using recombinant
adenoviral expression of dominant negative IkBa that overexpression of IkB rescued neuronal injury caused by cerebral
ischemia [37]. The reduction of IkB during the course of cerebral
ischemia and reperfusion is mainly due to its degradation by
proteasome after it is phosphorylated by IkB kinase (IKK) [7].
However, it was found that NF-kB/p65 phosphorylation coincides
with promotion of IkBa degradation [38]. In the present study, we
demonstrated that ischemic postconditioning inhibited the ischemia/reperfusion-induced higher level of phosphorylated NF-kB/
p65 in both cytoplasm and nucleus, which was consistent with the
finding that ischemic postconditioning reversed the decreased level
of IkBa caused by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (figure 4).
Evidence showed that oxidative stress is an upstream event
promoting IkB phosphorylation [10,39]. Moreover, Shen et al
reported antioxidant attenuated reperfusion injury after global
brain ischemia via inhibiting NF-kB activity by mitigating the
phosphorylation of IkB [40]. Similarly, Fischer et al proved that
anti-oxidative treatment suppressed activation of NF-kB during
myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in heart. [41]. On the basis of
prior findings that ischemic postconditioning could attenuate the
overproduction of ROS caused by transient focal ischemia and
reverse the damaged activity in endogenous antioxidant enzyme
[18,42], we think that the inhibitory effect of ischemic postconditioning on the phosphorylation of IkB is also associated with
its inhibition of oxidative stress.
The role of NF-kB/p65 during the course of cerebral ischemia
and reperfusion is complex. In vitro and in vivo studies have
shown that sublethal ischemia-induced activation of NF-kB/p65
contributed to the protection of ischemic preconditioning against
subsequent lethal ischemic insult [43,44]. Blondeau et al found
that the protection of activated NF-kB/p65 against neuronal
damage caused by following lethal stresses could be counteracted
by diethyldithiocarbamate, an NF-kB/p65 specific inhibitor [44].
By contrast, other studies revealed that inhibiting the activation of
NF-kB/p65 contributed to protection of tissue injury. Kin et al
reported that the inhibition of myocardial apoptosis by post-

conditioning is associated with attenuation of NF-kB/p65
translocation [45]. Yin et al showed that preconditioning with
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin rescued brain damage via attenuating
the production of NF-kB/p65 caused by subsequent ischemia/
reperfusion[46]. Although ischemic postconditioning and preconditioning might share common pathways to induce intrinsic
protective mechanism such as modulation of ASIC1a, notch
signaling and neuroinflammation, [47,48,31], our result showed
that the effect of ischemic postconditioning on activation of NFkB/p65 is inhibitive, which is opposite to the inducing effect
produced by ischemic preconditioning.
It has been demonstrated that ischemic postconditioning
protects transient ischemia-induced tissue damage in various
organs, including heart, liver and intestine [13,49,50]. By now, the
protective mechanism underlying ischemic postconditioning has
been investigated widely and is found to be related to multiple
factors including suppression of oxidative stress, maintaining
mitochondrial function, inhibition of endoplasmic stress, attenuation of inflammation and mitigation of protein aggregation [51–
54]. Different with previous reports showing that the inhibitory
effect of ischemic postconditioning on cellular apoptosis is via
down-regulating anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, up-regulating proapoptotic caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-9[55], and activation of
ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathway[56,57], our result suggests
that inhibition of neuronal apoptosis by ischemic postconditioning
is related to attenuation of the activation of neuronal NF-kB/p65.

Conclusion
Our study showed that ischemic postconditioning inhibited
brain damage and neuronal apoptosis induced by transient
ischemia. During the course of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion,
the activation of NF-kB/p65 due to the phosphorylation of its
inhibitor I-kBa and phosphorylation of NF-kB/p65 resulted in
up-regulated expression of proapoptotic proteins Noxa, Bim and
Bax. However, administration of ischemic postconditioning prior
to the recovery of cerebral blood flow significantly inhibited these
changes and rescued neuronal apoptosis. Therefore, our study
indicates that ischemic postconditioning is an effective method that
could protect neuronal apoptosis via attenuating the activation of
NF-kB/p65 caused by focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.
