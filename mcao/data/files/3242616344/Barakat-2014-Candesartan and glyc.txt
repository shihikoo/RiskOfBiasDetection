Stroke is the second leading cause of death in industrialized countries and the most frequent cause of
permanent disability in adults worldwide. The ﬁnal outcome of stroke is determined not only by the
volume of the ischemic core, but also by the extent of secondary brain damage inﬂicted to penumbral
tissues by brain swelling, impaired microcirculation, and inﬂammation. The only drug approved for the
treatment ischemic stroke is recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). The current study
was designed to investigate the protective effects of candesartan (0.15 mg/kg, orally) and glycyrrhizin
(30 mg/kg, orally) experimentally-induced ischemic brain damage in C57BL/6 mice (middle cerebral
artery occlusion, MCAO) in comparison to the effects of a standard neuroprotective drug (cerebrolysin,
7.5 mg/kg, IP). All drugs were administered 30 min before and 24 h after MCAO. Both candesartan and
glycyrrhizin ameliorated the deleterious effects of MCAO as indicated by the improvement in the
performance of the animals in behaviour tests, reduction in brain infarction, neuronal degeneration, and
leukocyte inﬁltration. In addition, MCAO induced a signiﬁcant upregulation in the different elements of
the TLR pathway including TLR-2 and TLR-4, Myd88, TRIF and IRF-3 and the downstream effectors TNF-α,
IL-1β, IL-6 and NF-kB. All these changes were signiﬁcantly ameliorated by treatment with candesartan
and glycyrrhizin. The results of the current study represent a new indication for both candesartan and
glycyrrhizin in the management of ischemic stroke with effects comparable to those of the standard
neuroprotective drug cerebrolysin.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the second leading cause of death in industrialized
countries and the most frequent cause of permanent disability in
adults worldwide. Despite advances in understanding the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia, therapeutic options for acute
ischemic stroke remain very limited (Woodruff et al., 2011).
Toll like receptors (TLRs) are one group of pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs) that detect damage-associated molecular pattern
molecules (DAMPs) released from dead/dying cells (Carty and
Bowie, 2011; Takeda and Akira, 2005). In the brain, TLRs are
expressed in microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons
(Ahmad et al., 2013). Activation of microglial cells in response to
cerebral ischemia is associated with a signiﬁcant induction of TLR2 and TLR-4, which are considered to mediate the inﬂammatory
reaction involved in the pathophysiological processes of ischemic
injury (Kong and Le, 2011).

Several lines of clinical and experimental evidence suggest an
important role of the brain rennin-angiotensin (RAS) in ischemic
brain injury (Li et al., 2005). Endogenous levels of angiotensin II
(Ang II) (Mecca et al., 2009) and angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor
(Edvinsson, 2008) are increased following stroke and angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to attenuate the deleterious effects in animal stroke models (Mecca et al., 2009).
Angiotensin II, acting via AT1 receptor, promotes vasoconstriction, oxidative stress, inﬂammation and atherosclerosis (Dasu
et al., 2009). Angiotensin II also induces an increase in reactive
oxygen spices and a proinﬂammatory phenotype via AT1 receptor
(Dasu et al., 2009).
Stimulation of AT2 receptors promotes cell differentiation and
regeneration in neuronal tissue (Li et al., 2005). Also angiotensin II,
acting through the AT2 receptor, represents a neurotrophic factor
for neurons in the central nervous system (Li et al., 2005).
Glycyrrhizin (GL) has diverse biological activities, including antiinﬂammatory, anti-viral, anti-liver cancer, antioxidative, immunomodulatory, cardioprotective and hepatoprotective activities (Kim et al.,
2012; Schrofelbauer et al., 2009). GL attenuated ischemia-induced
learning and memory deﬁcits and protected against cell damage in
the brain (Hou et al., 2010).
The current study was designed to investigate the protective
effects of candesartan (ARB at a sub-hypotensive dose) and

glycyrrhizin (a natural compound with anti-inﬂammatory activity)
against experimentally-induced ischemic brain damage (middle
cerebral artery occlusion, MCAO) in C57BL/6 mice as indicated by
alterations in behaviour, infarct volume, neuronal degeneration
and leukocyte inﬁltration. Also the current investigation explored
the effects of ischemia and the tested compounds on the expression/activity of the different components on the toll-like receptor
(TLR) pathway including TLR-2 and TLR-4, MYD88, TRIF and IRF-3
and the downstream effectors TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and NF-κB. The
effects of the tested compounds were compared to the effects of
the standard neuroprotective drug; Cerebrolysin.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
C57BL/6 mice (18–24 g) purchased from Theodor Bilharzias
Center, Cairo, Egypt were used in all experiments. The mice were
kept under standard environmental and nutritional conditions
throughout the investigation. This study was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Ethical Committee for animal
handling at Zagazig University (ECAHZU). All experiments, surgery, neurological scores and infarct volume determination were
performed in a randomized manner.
Mice were randomly distributed into 5 major groups (n ¼10) as
follows: Sham operated mice, Ischemic mice, Ischemic mice
treated with candesartan (0.15 mg/kg, orally) (Groth et al., 2003)
or glycyrrhizin (30 mg/kg, orally) (Tang et al., 2007) or cerebrolysin
(7.5 mg/kg, IP) (Ren et al., 2007) 30 min before and 24 h after
surgery.
These doses were selected based on a pilot experiment in a
separate group of animals treated with candesartan (0.1, 0.15 or
0.2 mg/kg) or glycyrrhizin (10, 20 or 30 mg/kg) daily for 7 days and
blood pressure was measured daily using non-invasive blood
pressure recorder (Powerlab 26T/NIBP Controller, ADInstrument).
Avertin (2,2,2-Tribromoethanol), Amylene hydrate (tertiary
amyl alcohol), DAPI (40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dilactate),
mouse IL-1β ELISA Kit were purchased from Sigma Aldrdich
(Germany). Fluoro-Jade was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula,
CA, USA), mouse anti-NF-κB p65 antibody, mouse anti-CD45
antibody, normal gout serum were purchased from Millipore
(USA). Hydroquinone, Lithium carbonate (LiCO3), Silver nitrate
(AgNO3) were purchased from Acros Organics (USA), mouse IL-6
ELISA Kit, mouse TNF-α ELISA Kit were purchased from R&D
Systems (USA).

2.2. Induction of ischemia
Middle cerebral artery occlusion, (MCAO) was performed
according to the method described previously (Neubert et al.,
2011). After 48 h, the animals were anesthetized, and perfused
with 50 ml Ringer0 s solution through the heart. The brain was
carefully isolated then stored at  80 1C. 20–30 mm sections were
prepared using cryostat (SLEE, Mainz, Germany). The whole brain
was cut from olfactory bulb to the cerebellum. The distance
between sections was 400 mm. Brain sections were used for the
determination of infarct volume, nuclear factor kappa β activation,
leukocyte inﬁltration and to quantify neuronal damage by FluoroJade staining. The expression of TLR-2, TLR-4, MYD88, TRIF and
IRF3 in the ischemic hemisphere was quantiﬁed via real time
RT-PCR. The level of the inﬂammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-1β and
IL-6 was detected in the ischemic hemisphere using selective
ELISA kits.

2.3. Behavioural test
Mice were assessed for neurological deﬁcits and scored as
described previously (Bederson et al., 1986).
Chimney test was preformed to assess motor coordination as
descried previously (Heinecke, 1987) and corner test was used to
measure a sensorimotor deﬁcit (Zhang et al., 2002).
2.4. Determination of the infarct volume by silver staining
Silver infarct staining (SIS) was used to quantify the dead brain
tissue as described in Vogel et al. (1999). The sections were
scanned using Scanner (HP Scan jet G2710). The areas of infarction
were calculated using Image J s programme (Scion Corporation,
Frederick, MD, USA). To compensate for the effect of brain oedema,
the corrected infarct volume was calculated by the following
formula (Wali et al., 2012):
ðRight Hemisphere þSilver DeficitÞ–Left Hemisphere
¼ Infarct Volume
2.5. Determination of neuronal degeneration by Fluoro-Jade B
staining (FJ-B)
Fluoro-Jade staining was performed using the method
described previously (Li et al., 2011). Fluoro-Jade stained slides
were visualized under ﬂuorescent microscope (Leica DM500,
Leica, Germany). At least ten different ﬁelds were photographed
from each section and the images were analyzed by Image J s
software.
2.6. Determination of TLR-2, TLR-4, MYD 88, TRIF and IRF3
by qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from tissue homogenate from the
ischemic hemisphere using SV Total RNA Isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer0 s protocol. The extracted RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using
RT-PCR kit (Stratagene, USA) according to the manufacturer0 s
protocol.
A real time- PCR reaction mixture was composed of 25 ml SYBR
Green Mix (2x), 0.5 ml cDNA, 2 ml of each primer pair mix (5 pmol/
ml each primer), and dH2O to 50 ml.
The following primers were used; TLR-2-F: 50 -GAGCATCCGAATTGCATCAC-30 , TLR-2-R: 50 -TATGGCCACCAAGATCCAGA-30 , TLR-4-F: 50 TCGAATCCTGAGCAAACAGC-30 , TLR-4-R: 50 -CCCGGTAAGGTCCATGCTAT-30 , MyD88-F: 50 -AAGAAAGTGAGTCTCCCCTC-30 , MyD88-R: 50 TCCCATGAAACCTCTAACAC-30 , TRIF-F: 50 -ATGGATAACCCAGGGCCTT30 , TRIF-R: 50 -TTCTGGTCACTGCAGGGGAT-30 , β-actin-F: 50 -AGAACATCATCCCTGCATCC-30 , β-actin-R: 50 -TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-30 , IRF-F:
50 -TGGGAGTTCGAGGTGAC-30 , IRF3-R: 50 -GGGCTCAGCTCTCCCCAG-30 .
The PCR program used to amplify cDNA consisted of 120 s at
50 1C, 10 min at 95 1C and 40 cycles of 15 s at 94 1C, 30 s at 60 1C
and 30 s at 72 1C, followed by 10 min at 72 1C. The real time- PCR
result was analyzed with the step PE Applied Biosystems (Perkin
Elmer) software and the data were expressed in Cycle threshold
(Ct). Target gene expression was assessed and related to reference
gene (β-actin) (Cho et al., 2011).
2.7. Detection of NF-κB p65 activity and CD45 expressing cells by
Immunohistochemistry
Brain sections were air dried, placed in absolute methanol for
10 min at  20 1C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
twice, immersed in 1% triton and then 1% tween, 5 min each.

Nonspeciﬁc binding was blocked by incubation in 5% normal gout
serum in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h.
Mouse anti-NFκB p65 antibody or mouse anti-CD45 antibody
1:100 in 5% NGS was added to the sections for 2 h. After washing
in PBS, goat antimouse antibody 1:100 in 5% NGS, was added and
incubated for 1 h. Then the slides were washed with PBS 3 times.
The nuclei were stained with DAPI (1:10,000 in dH2O), for 5 min.
The slides were washed with dH2O for 2 min, air dried. The slides
were coverslipped with ﬂuoromount mounting medium. Fluorescence was visualized under ﬂuorescent microscope (Leica DM 500,
Leica, Germany). At least ten different ﬁelds were photographed
from each section and the images were analyzed by Image J s
software.
2.8. Determination of inﬂammatory mediators by ELISA
The levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α were measured in homogenates prepared from the ischemic hemisphere using ELISA kit
according to the manufacturer0 s protocol (R&D systems, USA).
2.9. Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean 7standard error of mean. Statistical analysis was performed using one way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey0 s post Hoc test using Graph pad Prism
software version 5. For all analysis, the level of statistical signiﬁcance was set at P o0.05.

3. Results
Daily administration of candesartan (0.15 mg/kg) or glycyrrhizin (30 mg/kg) did not cause any signiﬁcant change in blood
pressure (data not shown).
Fig. 1 shows the change in behaviour induced by the different
treatments. Treatment with candesartan, glycyrrhizin and cerebrolysin, caused signiﬁcant reduction in neurological scores compared with ischemic group reaching 2.2, 1.5 and 2.2 vs 3.2,
respectively (Fig. 1A).
The chimney test pointed out early deﬁcits of motor coordination in MCAO mice. Ischemic mice in day 1 and day 2 were
signiﬁcantly slower than pre-ischemic day 1 and day 2 to get out
of the tube. Moreover ischemic mice day 2 were signiﬁcantly
slower than day 1. Treatment with candesartan, glycyrrhizin and
cerebrolysin, signiﬁcantly improved the time needed for the mice
to get out of the tube in day 1 compared with ischemic day
1 reaching 3.83, 4.41 and 3.33 vs 6.16 s, respectively. Moreover,
treatment with candesartan, glycyrrhizin, cerebrolysin, signiﬁcantly enhanced the time needed for the mice to get out of the
tube in day 2 compared with ischemic day 2 reaching 4.83, 4.91
and 3.5 vs 7.58 s, respectively (Fig. 1B).
The corner test was used to detect any impairment of the motor
activity and the loss of symmetry. Animals subjected to left MCAO
showed a signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of right turns
reaching 88.19 in ischemic day 1 vs 51.38 and 90.97 in ischemic
day 2 vs 43.05, compared with the same mice prior to MCAO.
There were no signiﬁcant changes in the percentage of right turns
between ischemic day 1 and ischemic day 2. Fig. 1C shows that
administration of cerebrolysin signiﬁcantly decreased the percentage of right turns in day 1 reaching 65.27 vs 88.19 in ischemic
mice day 1. Nevertheless; candesartan and glycyrrhizin did not
show signiﬁcant improvement compared with ischemic mice day1.
Moreover, treatment with candesartan, glycyrrhizin and cerebrolysin signiﬁcantly decreased the percentage of right turns in day
2 compared to ischemic day 2 reaching 56.13, 57.57 and 67.36 vs
90.97, respectively.

The size of infarcts was used as an indicator of the extent of
ischemic brain damage following MCAO. Treatment with candesartan, glycyrrhizin and cerebrolysin signiﬁcantly decreased the
infarct volume compared to the ischemic group reaching 12.49,
13.38 and 10.76 vs 21.11 respectively as shown in Fig. 2A and B.
Fig. 2C and D shows that treatment with candesartan, glycyrrhizin
and cerebrolysin, signiﬁcantly deceased neuronal degeneration as
indicated by the ﬂuorescence of Fluoro-Jade compared to the
ischemic group reaching 4.64, 4.04 and 2.8 vs 8.23, respectively.
After MCAO, the expression of TLR-2, TLR-4, MYD88, TRIF and
IRF-3 was signiﬁcantly increased as shown in Fig. 3. Treatment
with candesartan, glycyrrhizin and cerebrolysin, caused a signiﬁcant decrease in TLR-2 expression compared to the ischemic
group reaching 0.7, 0.6 and 0.65 vs 1.18 respectively as shown in

Treatment with candesartan, glycyrrhizin and cerebrolysin
signiﬁcantly decreased IL-1β level by compared to the ischemic
group reaching 76.17, 65.92 and 67.82 vs 92.47 respectively as
shown in Fig. 5A. Treatment with candesartan, glycyrrhizin and
cerebrolysin signiﬁcantly decreased IL-6 level compared to the
ischemic group reaching 95.03, 80.8 and 96.42 vs 121.27 respectively as shown in Fig. 5B. Administration of candesartan, glycyrrhizin and cerebrolysin signiﬁcantly declined TNF-α level
compared to the ischemic group reaching 81.75, 70.07 and 77.82
vs 110.85 respectively as shown in Fig. 5C.
Treatment with candesartan, glycyrrhizin and cerebrolysin
signiﬁcantly diminished leukocyte inﬁltration compared to the
ischemic group reaching 12.29, 10.24 and 12.19 vs 15.49 respectively as shown in Fig. 6A and B.

signiﬁcantly diminished TLR-4 expression compared to the
ischemic group reaching 0.79, 0.76 and 0.8 vs 1.23 respectively
as demonstrated in Fig. 3B.
Fig. 3C illustrates that treatment with candesartan, glycyrrhizin
and cerebrolysin has signiﬁcantly reduced MYD88 relative expression compared to the ischemic group reaching 1.44, 1.51 and 1.31
vs 2.17, respectively. Administration of candesartan, glycyrrhizin
and cerebrolysin signiﬁcantly reduced TRIF relative expression
compared to the ischemic group reaching 0.61, 0.59 and 0.43 vs
0.84 respectively as seen in Fig. 3D. Administration of candesartan,
glycyrrhizin, cerebrolysin and signiﬁcantly decreased IRF relative
expression compared to the ischemic group reaching 6.36, 4.69,
4.57 vs 10.05 respectively as presented in Fig. 3E.
Immunohistochemical staining for NF-κB showed that treatment with candesartan, glycyrrhizin and cerebrolysin signiﬁcantly
decreased the activity of NF-κB compared to the ischemic group
reaching 10.55, 9.04 and 10.33 vs 14.38 respectively as illustrated
in Fig. 4A and B.

Few neurological conditions are as complex and devastating as
stroke (Moskowitz et al., 2010). Currently, thrombolysis with
tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) is the only effective therapy,
but due to its narrow therapeutic window and safety concern;
fewer than 5% of stroke patients receive this treatment (Woodruff
et al., 2011). It is crucial to expand the narrow therapeutic
opportunities for this devastating condition.
Cerebral ischemia evokes a strong inﬂammatory response
characterized by the release of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion
molecules and proteolytic enzymes that exacerbate tissue damage
(Caso et al., 2007). Therefore in this work, we focused on the
inﬂammatory response to brain ischemia and the potential role of
anti-inﬂammatory substances as candesartan and glycyrrhizin
against ischemic brain injury. However, both candesartan and
glycyrrhizin might have an effect on the blood pressure at certain
dose levels (candesartan might reduce the blood pressure while
glycyrrhizin might elevate the blood pressure). Since, hypertension
is the single most important risk factor for ischemic stroke (Fagan
and Hess, 2008; Fahimfar et al., 2012), we used doses of candesartan and glycyrrhizin that did not mediate any signiﬁcant change
in the blood pressure (based on our pilot experiment) and focused
only on their effect on the TLR signaling cascade.
No neurological deﬁcits were observed in the sham-operated
group, while the ischemic group exhibited signiﬁcant increase in
neurological scores. Also ischemia was associated with delayed
performance in the chimney test and an increase in the percentage
of right turns in the corner test. All these behavioral tests indicate
a sever deﬁcit in the neurological function of the ischemic animals.
No infarction was observed in the sham-operated group, whereas
extensive lesions were developed in the MCAO group. Similar
changes induced by MCAO have been previously reported (Chiang
et al., 2011).
In this study; TLR-2, TLR-4 and their adaptor proteins were not
detectable in cerebral tissue from sham group. Expression of TLR2, TLR-4, MYD88, TRIF and IRF-3 was enhanced in ischemic
animals compared to sham group. These results are in accordance
with previous studies (Ma et al., 2013) who demonstrated an
upregulation of TLR-2, TLR-4 and MyD88 in MCAO stroke model.
Moreover, TLR-2 or TLR-4 deﬁciency caused both signiﬁcant
reduction of infarct volume and suppressed inﬂammatory cytokine
expression in inﬁltrating immune cells after brain ischemia
(Shichita et al., 2012).
Inﬁltrating leukocytes and injured brain cells produce various
inﬂammatory mediators, leading to the beginning of postischemic inﬂammation (Shichita et al., 2012). Minor amounts of
CD45 (leukocyte antigen) expressing cells, active form of NF-κB
p65, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were detected in sham operated

animals. MCAO resulted in a rise in CD45 expressing cells, NF-κB
p65, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 48 h after the ischemic insult.
It is well known that stroke activates several neural cells
(microglia, astrocytes, neurons and endothelial cells) which
can secrete many pro-inﬂammatory mediators, including IL-1 β
(Rothwell et al., 1997) and TNF-α (Barone et al., 1997) that
stimulate the expression of cellular adhesion molecules on
endothelial cells, and promote leukocyte adherence and migration
into brain parenchyma (Wang et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2012). The
induction of these inﬂammatory elements is regulated by the
transcription factor NF-κB (Phillips et al., 2000).
Several previous reports have demonstrated similar increase in
inﬂammatory mediators like IL-1β, HMGB1 (Shichita et al., 2012),
IL-6 (Hua et al., 2007) and NF-κB (Ma et al., 2013) in the ischemic
brains. Moreover, ischemia did not result in similar changes in the
expression of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and HMGB1 in the TLR-4  /  mice
(Hua et al., 2007) indicating an essential role of TLR(-4) in the
release of inﬂammatory mediators following ischemia.
Little neuronal degeneration was observed in sham operated
animals, but MCAO caused an abrupt increase in neuronal degeneration as indicated by Fluoro-Jade ﬂuorescence. IL-1β was found
to induce apoptosis of neuronal cells and to enhance the expression of chemokines in microglia and astrocytes (Shichita et al.,
2012).

The present study examined the effect of a subhypotensive
dose of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB); candesartan
(0.15 mg/kg) in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Animals that
were treated with candesartan showed signiﬁcant improvement in
neurological scores and performance in corner and chimney test,
compared to ischemic animals. In addition, candesartan signiﬁcantly reduced cerebral infarct volume. It has been reported that
ARBs caused a signiﬁcant reduction of infarct volume and reduced
the neurological deﬁcits in normotensive rats and spontaneously
hypertensive rats (SHRs)(Mecca et al., 2009). These effects of
candesartan might be related to the improvement of cerebral
blood ﬂow, reducing brain temperature or inhibition of oxidative
stress (Hamai et al., 2006).
Results of the present study revealed increased neuronal
survival following candesartan as indicated by the decrease in
degenerated neurons detected by Fluoro-Jade B staining. Current
results are in agreement with previous reports in which ARB
exerted a neuroprotective effect by supporting neuronal survival
and neurite outgrowth in response to ischemia-induced neuronal
injury (Li et al., 2005).
The present study showed that candesartan decreased the
expression of TLR-2, TLR-4, MYD88, TRIF and IRF-3 compared with
ischemic animals. In support of our ﬁnding, it has been demonstrated that pretreatment of human monocytes with candesartan

signiﬁcantly decreased LPS-induced TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression
(Dasu et al., 2009).
In the current investigation, candesartan exerted an antiinﬂammatory effect as illustrated by a signiﬁcant decrease in
leukocyte inﬁltration and a decrease in the protein level of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 and NF-κB activity. Several reports suggested a
pronounced anti-inﬂammatory effect of candesartan (Dasu et al.,
2009; Schmerbach et al., 2008). The ability of candsartan to block
TLR signaling with the subsequent reduction in NF-kB activity
resulting in down-regulation of the production of TNF-α and IL-1β
might explain the observed reduction in leukocyte inﬁltration into
the brain.
In addition to its effects on TLR signaling, candesartan was
previously proven to exert an antioxidant action that might
contribute to its protective effect against ischemic brain injury.
The antioxidant actions of candesartan included inhibition of iNOS
expression after cerebral ischemia (Awad, 2011; Engelhorn et al.,
2004), attenuation of MDA, NADPH oxidase (Awad, 2011) and
nitrite concentration (Engelhorn et al., 2004) as well as restoration
of the SOD (Gaur and Kumar, 2011; Hamai et al., 2006), catalase
enzymes (Gaur and Kumar, 2011) and GSH (Awad, 2011) activities
in ischemic animals.
The lack of effective and widely applicable pharmacological
treatments for ischemic stroke patients may explain a growing
interest in traditional medicines (Hou et al., 2012). Glycyrrhizin
(GL), is a natural triterpene glycoside that is derived from the root
of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) (Gong et al., 2012). GL has diverse
biological activities, including anti-inﬂammatory (Tang et al.,
2007), anti-viral, anti-liver cancer, antioxidative, immunomodulatory, cardioprotective, and hepatoprotective activities (Kim and
Lee, 2008).
The antioxidant effects of glycyrrhizin were previously evidenced
by attenuation of hydrogen peroxide- and nitrogen species-induced
cell death (Kim and Lee, 2008), inhibition of reactive oxygen spices
generation by neutrophils (Asl and Hosseinzadeh, 2008), attenuation
of brain damage in mice treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,

6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) through inhibitory effect on oxidative
tissue damage (Kim and Lee, 2008). All these actions make glycyrrhizin a suitable candidate for the treatment of stroke. However, few
studies have been designed to examine its use in a stroke model.
In the current investigation, GL signiﬁcantly improved neurological scores; attenuated time needed for the mice to get out of
the chimney tube and improved the motor activity and symmetry in the corner test in comparison with the ischemic animals.
Similarly, it was found that treatment with GL attenuated
ischemia-induced learning and memory deﬁcits (Hou et al., 2010).
In addition, GL attenuated infract volume and neuronal degeneration in comparison with ischemic mice. This is in accordance
with a previous report that proved that the administration of GL
reduced the infarct volume following MCAO (Kim et al., 2011). In
addition, Hou found that GL attenuated neuronal injury, and
protected PC12 cells from excitotoxicity induced by Glutamate
(Hou et al., 2010).
The mechanism by which GL exerted these effects may be
through inhibitory effect on oxidative damage, suppressing
caspase-3 activation (Kim and Lee, 2008). Ogiku found that GL

stabilization of the structural integrity of cells by inhibition of
calpain (Masliah and Diez-Tejedor, 2012), reduction of BBB permeability changes, attenuation of brain pathology and mitigation of
functional deﬁcits (Sharma et al., 2010).
Cerebrolysin attenuated neuronal degeneration compared to
ischemic animals. Cerebrolysin was shown to enhance dentate
gyrus neurogenesis in normal rats and in mouse models of
Alzheimer0 s disease (AD) and promote adult hippocampal progenitor cells to differentiate into neurons in vitro (Zhang et al.,
2010).
The present study showed that CL diminished the expression of
different inﬂammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, NFκB and leukocyte inﬁltration. Very few reports discuss the antiinﬂammory effect of CL. Cerebrolysin was reported to exert a
neuroimmunotrophic activity by reducing the extent of inﬂammation (Alvarez et al., 2000), downregulation of microglia activation
after LPS treatment as well as by the control of IL-1β expression
(Lombardi et al., 1999).
In the current study, CL reduced the expression of the TLR
elements; it decreased TLR-2, TLR-4, MYD88 and TRIF. This is the
ﬁrst attempt to study the effect of CL on TLR cascade elements.
This could be attributed to a reduction in neuronal cell death with
the resultant decrease in inﬂammatory mediators.

protected liver from ischemia-reperfusion- (I/R)-induced injury by
stabilization of the membrane structure of hepatocytes (Ogiku
et al., 2011). Also, glycyrrhizin attenuated inﬂammatory responses
induced by TLR-3 and TLR-4 ligands by interaction with the lipid
bilayer, altering the integrity of the plasma membrane, thereby
attenuating receptor mediated signaling (Schrofelbauer et al.,
2009).
In the present study; GL suppressed the expression of TLR-2,
TLR-4, MYD88, TRIF and IRF-3 compared to the ischemic group. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to examine the effect of GL on
the expression of TLR pathway in brain ischemia.
In the current study, administration of GL reduced the level of
the inﬂammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 levels and NF-κB
activity compared to ischemic group. Moreover; treatment with GL
signiﬁcantly decreased CD45 expressing cells compared to
ischemic group indicating a reduction in leukocyte inﬁltration.
The decrease in leukocyte inﬁltration might be mediated through
blocking TLR signaling, reduction of NF-kB activation with subsequent decrease in some of its target genes as TNF-α and IL-1β
which play key role in the process of leukocyte inﬁltration into
the brain.
Similarly, GL was reported to attenuate the release of HMGB1 in
the transient spinal cord ischemic injury in rats and subsequently
reduced the release of inﬂammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-1β and
IL-6 (Gong et al., 2012).
In the current investigation; cerebrolysin (CL) improved neurologic deﬁcits and improved the performance in corner test and
chimney test and reduced infarct volume, after MCAO compared
with ischemic animals. It has been reported that acute treatment
with cerebrolysin reduces cerebral infarction in rats after transient
ischemia while delayed administration of cerebrolysin promotes
neurological functional recovery without reducing lesion volume
(Zhang et al., 2010). These effects of CL might be attributed to

In conclusion, the present study provides a new evidence for a
protective role of candesartan and GL against ischemic brain
damage which was mediated through downregulation of the TLR
signaling pathway with subsequent reduction in brain inﬂammation. The activities of both drugs were comparable to that of a
commonly used neuroprotective agent (CL) which might indicate a
beneﬁcial co treatment. In the current study, candesartan and GL
were used 30 min before and 24 h after MCAO and it is expected
that long term use of these agents might produce more pronounced effects especially if they were used early after onset of
stroke as this would provide early and extended inhibition of TLR
signaling.
This may extend the treatment options for stroke patients by
the use of candesartan and GL which may be enrolled safely into
clinical trials as they are already in use with humans for other
disease states.
