Background and Purpose—Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a unique cytokine that may contribute to brain repair by regulating
microglia/macrophage functions. Thus, we examined the effect of IL-4 on long-term recovery and microglia/macrophage
polarization in 2 well-established stroke models.
Methods—Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion or permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced
in wild-type and IL-4 knockout C57/BL6 mice. In a separate cohort of wild-type animals, IL-4 (60 ng/d for 7 days)
or vehicle was infused into the cerebroventricle after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Behavioral outcomes
were assessed by the Rotarod, corner, foot fault, and Morris water maze tests. Neuronal tissue loss was verified by 2
independent neuron markers. Markers of classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) microglia were
assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry.
Results—Loss of IL-4 exacerbated sensorimotor deficits and impaired cognitive functions ≤21 days post injury. In contrast
to the delayed deterioration of neurological functions, IL-4 deficiency increased neuronal tissue loss only in the acute
phase (5 days) after stroke and had no impact on neuronal tissue loss 14 or 21 days post injury. Loss of IL-4 promoted
expression of M1 microglia/macrophage markers and impaired expression of M2 markers at 5 and 14 days post injury.
Administration of IL-4 into the ischemic brain also enhanced long-term functional recovery.
Conclusions—The cytokine IL-4 improves long-term neurological outcomes after stroke, perhaps through M2 phenotype
induction in microglia/macrophages. These results are the first to suggest that immunomodulation with IL-4 is a
promising approach to promote long-term functional recovery after stroke.   (Stroke. 2016;47:498-504. DOI: 10.1161/

erebral ischemia launches multiple rapid immune
responses, characterized by the activation of resident
microglia, the infiltration of peripheral immune cells such
as macrophages and lymphocytes, and the accumulation of
immune mediators in the lesioned brain. Remarkably, emerging evidence suggests that activated microglia/macrophages
polarize into distinct phenotypes to differentially regulate the
microenvironment in the injured brain.1–3 Specifically, classically activated M1 microglia release destructive proinflammatory mediators and exacerbate brain damage.1,2,4 In contrast,
the alternatively activated M2 phenotype is essential for tissue preservation and brain repair because M2 cells resolve
local inflammation, clear cell debris, and provide trophic

factors.1,4–6 We recently discovered a M2-to-M1 phenotype
shift in the subacute stages of stroke,2 resulting in an unfavorable environment for brain recovery. Further elucidating
the endogenous factors that regulate microglia/macrophage
polarization after stroke may hasten the identification of novel
therapeutic targets to improve stroke outcomes.
Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a multifunctional cytokine secreted
mainly by T-helper 2 cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils,
and stromal cells.7 IL-4 is well-known to regulate a variety
of immune responses, including T-cell differentiation and IgE
class switch in B cells. It is also thus far the best-characterized
promoter of M2 polarization in microglia and macrophages.
Accumulating evidence indicates that IL-4 plays critical roles

in brain function under both physiological and pathological
conditions. For example, T cell–derived IL-4 is important
in learning and memory in the normal brain.8 IL-4 levels in
the brain decline with age,9 perhaps contributing to cognitive
decline in aged populations and increasing the risk for development of Alzheimer disease. Recent results from clinical and
animal studies support the importance of IL-4 in the acute
stages of stroke. In patients, serum levels of IL-4 increase significantly several hours after stroke onset.10 IL-4 deficiency
exacerbates brain injury and worsens neurological outcomes
24 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO) in animal models of stroke,11,12 suggesting that IL-4
serves as an early endogenous neuroprotective mechanism
soon after stroke onset. The effect of IL-4 on long-term recovery after stroke has not yet been explored although persistent
recovery is more important for clinical translation.
In this report, we used IL-4 knockout (KO) mice to investigate the natural role of endogenous IL-4 in long-term neurobehavioral and neuropathological outcomes after focal cerebral
ischemia. We discovered that IL-4 deficiency exacerbates
sensorimotor and cognitive deficits ≤21 days after tMCAO
or distal MCAO (dMCAO), and that this persistent effect is
accompanied by impaired microglia/macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype. Conversely, the administration
of IL-4 directly into the ischemic brain enhances functional
recovery after stroke. Therefore, IL-4 is an important immune
modulator serving to improve long-term outcomes after
stroke, perhaps by regulating microglia/macrophage polarization and promoting an immune milieu that is highly permissive for behavioral recovery.

groups. The pump was programmed to achieve a constant infusion
rate of 0.5 μL/h, starting from 6 hours after tMCAO. The pump was
removed at 7 days after tMCAO.

Statistical Analysis
All data were reported as mean±SEM. Significant differences between means were assessed by 1- or 2-way ANOVA and post hoc least
significant difference tests for multiple comparisons. The Student’s t

Results
Increased Expression of the IL-4 Receptor in the
Ischemic Brain
Previous studies report an early increase of IL-4 in the serum
of patients with stroke.10 We found that the expression of IL-4
mRNA in the mouse brain increased slightly but not significantly between 1 and 7 days after tMCAO and then collapsed
on day 14 (Figure 1A). Interestingly, the expression of the

Materials and Methods
Animal Models
All animal experiments were approved by the University of Pittsburgh
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and performed in accordance with the principles outlined in the National Institutes of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Wildtype (WT) or IL-4 KO male C57/BL6 mice (8–10 w, 25–30 g body
weight; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were randomly assigned to sham or cerebral ischemia groups using a lottery drawing
box. Transient focal ischemia was induced by MCAO for 60 minutes
as previously described.2 Sham-operated animals underwent anesthesia and exposure of the arteries without MCAO induction. Rectal
temperature was maintained at 37.0±0.5°C during and after surgery
with a temperature-controlled heating pad. Physiological parameters
were maintained within normal ranges. Regional cerebral blood flow
was monitored in all stroke animals using laser Doppler flowmetry.
Animals that died or failed to show at least 70% regional cerebral
blood flow reduction were excluded from further analyses. Mice in
both genotypes were subjected to repeated measurements of CBF
before ischemia, 5 minutes after tMCAO and 5 minutes after reperfusion using a laser speckle contrast imager (LDF, PeriFlux System
5000, Perimed). In all experiments, the tMCAO or sham surgeries
were performed by an investigator blinded to genotype.

Intracerebroventricular IL-4 Administration
WT mice subjected to 60-minute MCAO or sham operation were
randomly assigned to vehicle or IL-4 groups. An intracerebroventricular catheter was stereotaxically implanted into the ventricle
contralateral to the lesion site (coordinates: −0.20 mm anterior and
1.00 mm lateral to bregma). An ALZET osmotic minipump containing IL-4 (Peprotech, 60 ng/d) or phosphate-buffered saline was

IL-4 receptor (IL-4Rα) was significantly elevated within 1
day after stroke, and this elevation was maintained for at
least 14 days after stroke (Figure 1B). These findings reveal
compensatory changes in the IL-4 pathway after stroke
injury in vivo.

Loss of IL-4 Disrupts Long-Term Neurological
Functions After Ischemic/Reperfusion Injury

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

Next, we used IL-4 KO mice to investigate the effect of IL-4 on
long-term neurological outcomes after stroke. Transient focal
ischemia was induced by 60-minute tMCAO. Physiological
parameters, including blood pressure, blood gases, and glucose levels, exhibited no significant differences between WT
and KO mice (not shown). Regional cerebral blood flow, as
determined with a laser speckle contrast imager, did not differ
by genotype before ischemia, 5 minutes after ischemia, or 5
minutes after reperfusion (Figure 1C). These findings verify
that WT and IL-4 KO mice were subjected to the same ischemic insult during tMCAO and that any differences across
genotypes cannot be attributed to variations in blood flow.
To determine the impact of IL-4 on functional outcomes
after stroke, a battery of neurobehavioral tests were administered during both the acute and the long-term recovery stages
after tMCAO. Although the sensorimotor outcomes were comparable between IL-4 KO and WT mice early after stroke, the
KO mice exhibited much slower recovery over time, resulting
in significant deterioration of behavioral performance at late
stages after stroke. As shown in Figure 1D, the latency to fall
off the Rotarod was much shorter in IL-4 KO mice than in WT
mice at 5 to 9 days after stroke. Similarly, a protracted impairment in the corner test was observed in IL-4 KO mice at 9 to
14 days after tMCAO.
We further determined whether IL-4 deficiency impaired
long-term cognitive functions using the Morris water maze test.
The IL-4 KO and WT mice exhibited comparable cognitive
functions after sham surgery under physiological conditions.
However, long-term learning and memory deficits were significantly exacerbated in IL-4 KO mice after tMCAO, as manifested
by an increased latency to find the hidden platform (impaired
spatial learning ability) and reduced time spent in the target
quadrant when the platform was removed (impaired memory)
compared with WT mice (Figure 2A–2C). Both the genotypes
exhibited similar swim speeds (Figure 2D), suggesting equivalent swimming skills. Taken together, the results of the behavioral assays demonstrate a stable or persistent exacerbation of
neurological dysfunction after stroke in the absence of IL-4.

IL-4 Deficiency Results in Early, Transient
Enlargement of Infarct Size After Stroke
IL-4 KO mice exhibited greater infarct volumes than WT mice
at 5 days after tMCAO, as measured by loss of microtubuleassociated protein 2 (MAP2) (marker of neuronal dendrites
and somas, Figure 3) and NeuN (marker of neuronal nuclei,
Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). In contrast to
the delayed deterioration of neurological functions shown
in Figures 1 and 2, the neuronal tissue loss in IL-4 KO mice
was not significantly different from WT mice at 14 and 21
days after tMCAO (Figure 3; Figure I in the online-only Data

Supplement). These results suggest that endogenous IL-4 may
delay neuronal death but cannot rescue neurons or reduce neuronal tissue loss over the long term.

Loss of IL-4 Shifts Microglia/Macrophage
Polarization Toward M1
Recent studies have highlighted the importance of microglia/
macrophage polarity in the progression of brain injury and
in brain repair.13 IL-4 is known to induce microglia/macrophage polarization toward the beneficial M2 phenotype.
Therefore, we explored whether the poor outcomes in IL-4
KO mice were associated with altered microglia/macrophage
polarization after stroke. Real-time polymerase chain reaction measurements revealed the elevation of multiple M1-like
markers, including CD16, tumor necrosis factor α, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), at both 5 and 14 days after
tMCAO in IL-4 KO mice (Figure 4A). Double immunostaining for CD16 and the microglia/macrophage marker Iba-1
confirmed that the number of CD16+ M1 microglia/macrophages was significantly increased in the striatum, but not in
the cortex, in IL-4 KO mice after tMCAO (Figure 4B–4D).
These results are consistent with an enhancement in M1
polarization and cerebral inflammation that extends into the
late stages after stroke in IL-4 KO mice. Consistent with
these findings, IL-4 KO mice exhibited reduced expression of
M2-like markers (CD206 and IL-10) in the ischemic brain at
both 5 and 14 days after tMCAO (Figure 5A). As shown by

Neurological Functions and Impairs Microglia/
Macrophage M2 Polarization After Permanent
dMCAO

Effects that can be generalized across different stroke models
are more likely to translate to clinical studies. Thus, we also
tested the effect of IL-4 in a model of permanent distal MCAO
(dMCAO). The corner test revealed that dMCAO resulted in
transient sensorimotor deficits early after surgery with a recovery by 9 days after dMCAO in WT mice. IL-4 deficiency significantly prolonged the sensorimotor deficits (Figure IIA in
the online-only Data Supplement). Consistent with the results
in the tMCAO model, NeuN immunostaining revealed similar
neuronal tissue loss in WT and IL-4 KO mice at 21 days after
dMCAO (Figure IIB in the online-only Data Supplement).
Real-time polymerase chain reaction measurements revealed
increased mRNA expression of M1 markers (tumor necrosis
factor α) and reduced expression of M2 markers (CD206 and
IL-10) at 21 days after dMCAO in IL-4 KO mice (Figure IIC
in the online-only Data Supplement). These results verify that
IL-4 deficiency impairs M2 polarization and worsens neurological outcomes in 2 independent stroke models.

immunostaining, the number of CD206+ M2 microglia/macrophages was significantly decreased in IL-4 KO mice in both
cortex and striatum at 14 days after stroke (Figure 5B). We
then used flow cytometry to further characterize microglia
(CD45intermediateCD11b+) and macrophages (CD45highCD11b+)
during IL-4–induced M2 phenotype shifts. We found that
IL-4 deficiency reduced the number of CD206+ macrophages
in the ischemic brain (Figure 5C). The majority of resting
microglia in the brain was CD206+, although the expression
level of CD206 per cell was relatively weak. Interestingly,
the MCAO insult enhanced the mean fluorescence intensity
of CD206 staining in each cell without increasing the total
number of CD206+ microglia. These results suggest that resting microglia may already possess M2 properties that might
be enhanced on stimulation. This notion is consistent with
previous reports that M2 microglia show a greater tendency
to maintain their M2 status.14,15 Compared with the flow
cytometry results, the immunostaining revealed a more dramatic drop in the number of CD206+ microglia/macrophages
in IL-4 KO stroke mice. This finding might be attributed
to the relatively lower sensitivity and higher threshold for
immunohistochemical detection of CD206+, such that weakly
positive cells in flow cytometry may be identified as negative
by immunohistochemical staining. Taken together, our data
suggest that endogenous IL-4 plays an important role in M2
microglia/macrophage polarization after stroke, which would
be expected to facilitate long-term neurobehavioral recovery
by creating an anti-inflammatory milieu.

supplementation to be extremely effective at this time point.
Thus, to further confirm the importance of IL-4 in persistent
stroke recovery, recombinant IL-4 (60 ng/d) was continuously
infused through an osmotic minipump into the brain of C57/
BL6 mice beginning 6 hours after tMCAO or sham operation and lasting for 1 week. Neurological functions were then
assessed at various time points after surgery. IL-4 post treatment failed to improve neurobehavioral performance 1 to 7
days after tMCAO. However, at late stages after tMCAO, IL-4–
treated mice showed improved performance in the Rotarod
(14–35 days) and foot fault tests (21–35 days; Figure 6A–6B).
Moreover, IL-4–treated mice exhibited improvements in cognitive functions, as manifested by improved spatial learning
and memory in the Morris water maze (Figure 6C). Overall
neuronal tissue loss was measured on NeuN-stained sections
at 14 and 35 days after tMCAO but revealed no significant
effect of IL-4 treatment (Figure 6D), entirely consistent with
the IL-4 KO data.

Discussion
IL-4 is an important anti-inflammatory cytokine that is already
known to protect the brain against acute ischemic injury.11
A recent study further suggests that IL-4 is essential for the
resistance to acute brain ischemia observed during estrus in
female animals.13 However, the long-term influence of IL-4
on the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke remains elusive.
In this study, we found a prolonged increase in mRNA levels
of the IL-4R in the ischemic brain, suggesting that there is
an increased response to IL-4 in both early and late stages
after stroke. In contrast, IL-4 expression increases only
slightly in the brain 1 to 7 days after stroke, followed by a

Administration of IL-4 Improves Neurological
Functions After Stroke Without Reducing
Neuronal Loss
If loss of endogenous IL-4 leads to long-term neurological
dysfunction, administration of exogenous IL-4 should have
the converse effect and lead to stable recovery of function.
Furthermore, if IL-4 protein levels are low 14 days after stroke
injury but receptor levels are high, then one would expect IL-4

dramatic decline at 14 days post injury. This transient IL-4
elevation might be attributed, at least partly, to the infiltration
and accumulation of T cells, the major cellular source of IL-4,
and other immune cells into the ischemic brain.16 In addition, a recent study demonstrated that injured neurons may
release IL-4 at acute stages of stroke.17 These results suggest
that increased signaling through the IL-4R may mitigate the
inflammatory environment after stroke and lay the groundwork for recovery of neural function. Consistent with this
hypothesis, we demonstrated that IL-4 deficiency significantly
impairs sensorimotor and cognitive performance in 2 models
of stroke, whereas IL-4 supplementation improves long-term
functional outcomes after brain ischemia. These data strongly
support a beneficial role for IL-4 in the recovery phase after
stroke. Consistent with the present findings, population-based
data demonstrate an association between IL-4 gene polymorphisms and functional outcomes after stroke and the incidence
of poststroke depression.18,19 Therefore, boosting IL-4 levels
is a promising therapeutic strategy to promote persistent and
stable neurological recovery after stroke.
The importance of IL-4 in cognitive function under physiological conditions has been disputed. One early report suggested that IL-4 KO mice exhibit defects in spatial learning and
memory capacities in the Morris water maze test.8 However,
a recent study using the same approach demonstrated comparable performance between IL-4–deficient mice and WT
controls.20 In addition, IL-4 KO mice performed normally in
object location recognition tests (spatial memory) and novel
object recognition tests (nonspatial memory), suggesting
equivalent baseline cognitive functions between WT and IL-4
KO genotypes.20 The present results confirm that sham IL-4
KO mice experience no changes in cognitive function in the
Morris water maze. However, IL-4 deficiency significantly
exacerbated cognitive dysfunction after stroke, demonstrating
the importance of IL-4 in maintaining or restoring cognitive
capacities under pathological conditions.
IL-4–specific receptors are ubiquitously expressed in glial
cells (microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) as well as
a variety of peripheral immune cells.8,11–14 However, it is not
known whether IL-4 targets cells in the central nervous ­system
directly or exerts central protection indirectly by modifying
peripheral immune responses after stroke. The increase in
IL-4R in ischemic brain cells in this study is consistent with
the view that IL-4 exerts at least some effects on the central
nervous system. Furthermore, intraventricular IL-4 infusions
improve long-term recovery after stroke, which is also consistent with the hypothesis that IL-4 elevation within the central
nervous system directly acts on cells in the brain to mitigate
the long-term neurological sequelae of stroke.
Microglia residing in the central nervous system, as well
as centrally infiltrating macrophages, are established cellular
targets of IL-4.21,22 Although IL-4 is well-known to induce
microglia/macrophage polarization in vitro and in vivo in
models of other neurological diseases,23,24 the effect of endogenous IL-4 on microglia/macrophage polarization status after
stroke has not previously been investigated. Our data clearly
show reductions in M2 microglia/macrophage polarization in
both the striatum and the cortex of IL-4 KO mice, strongly

supporting the importance of IL-4 in determining the M1/M2
equilibrium at both early and late stages after stroke. Because
of the well-known protective or restorative effects of M2
microglia/macrophages in the injured brain,13 the M2 phenotype shift observed in this study may be critical for long-term
behavioral protection after stroke. Further studies are warranted to test the novel hypothesis that M2 induction by IL-4
after stroke injury serves as a natural brake on the progression of neurological dysfunction in vivo. Other M2-inducing
cytokines, such as IL-10, have also been demonstrated to be
protective in models of stroke.25 Our data show that loss of
IL-4 reduces the expression of IL-10 in the ischemic brain.
Whether IL-4 works independently or in concert with IL-10 to
modulate microglia/macrophage M2 polarization after stroke
also deserves further investigation.
We have shown that the M1 phenotype exacerbates,
whereas the M2 phenotype mitigates neuronal death under
ischemic conditions.2 Although IL-4 loss promoted the M1
phenotype and reduced M2 induction in this study, there was
no significant long-term effect on neuronal loss, suggesting
that microglia/macrophage polarization is probably necessary
but not sufficient for neuroprotection. Because IL-4 deficiency
increased neuronal loss at acute phases of stroke but did not
seem to affect neuronal loss at late stages, it is possible that ≥1
neuron-independent mechanisms contribute to the long-term
beneficial role of IL-4 in neurological functions. For example,
recent evidence highlights the importance of white matter
injury in long-term sensorimotor and cognitive deficits after
stroke.26 Indeed, some compounds have been shown to protect white matter integrity after stroke without any significant
influence on gray matter,27 suggesting that white matter protection may be achieved independent of neuronal protection.
Therefore, white matter components may represent potential
targets for IL-4 treatment in stroke victims. Consistent with
these hypotheses, a protective role of IL-4 against white matter injury has been shown in a model of multiple sclerosis,
in which IL-4 KO mice exhibited greater demyelination and
functional deficits.28 Furthermore, experiments using selective depletion of M1 or M2 phenotypic cells have confirmed
that the M2 phenotype promotes, whereas the M1 phenotype
impairs, white matter recovery after demyelination.1 Further
studies are warranted to confirm the effect of IL-4 on white
matter integrity after stroke and further elucidate the cellular
targets of IL-4.
Our current study focused on the long-term effect of IL-4
on stroke in males. Interestingly, recent studies support the
importance of IL-4 in sex differences in stroke models.12,29
IL-4 is critical for neuroprotection during the estrus phase of
the estrous cycle in females.12 Furthermore, microglia isolated
from female mice after MCAO express higher levels of the
IL-4R on further inflammatory stimulation.29 Therefore, the
effect of IL-4 on long-term outcomes after stroke in female
warrants further investigation.
In summary, this study is the first to show that IL-4 stabilizes long-term behavioral performance after cerebral ischemia, possibly through a non-neuronal protective mechanism
involving induction of the M2 phenotype in microglia/macrophages. These results might lead to development of new

ONLINE SUPPLEMENT
Interleukin-4 is Essential for Microglia/Macrophage M2 Polarization and Long-term
Recovery after Cerebral Ischemia
Supplemental Methods:
Murine model of permanent focal ischemia All animals were randomly assigned to sham and
distal MCAO groups through the use of a lottery-drawing box. Focal cerebral ischemia was
produced by permanent distal MCAO, as previously reported,1 plus ipsilateral common carotid
artery (CCA) occlusion. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane in a 30% O2/68.5%
N2O mixture under spontaneous breathing conditions. Rectal temperature was maintained at
37.0°C±0.5°C during surgery with a temperature-regulated heating pad. First, a skin incision was
made at the midline of the neck. After being separated from the vagal nerve, the left CCA was
exposed and occluded by ligation. The skin was sutured and another skin incision was made
between the left eye and the ear. The temporal muscle was dissected by bipolar electrocautery
(Bipolar Coagulator, Codman & Shurtleff Inc., Randolph, MA, USA). The temporal muscle
temperature was maintained at 37.0°C±0.5°C by a heat lamp. After opening the burr hole and
performing a craniotomy, the distal part of the MCA was exposed. The dura mater was then cut
and the distal MCAO was completed with low-intensity bipolar electrocautery at the immediate
lateral part of the rhinal fissure. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured in all stroke
animals using laser Doppler flowmetry. Animals that did not show a regional CBF reduction to
<30% of pre-ischemia baseline levels were excluded from further experimentation. Shamoperated animals underwent the same anesthesia and surgical procedures but were not subjected
to CCAO and MCAO. All behavioral (sensorimotor and memory tests) and histological
(immunostaining and cell counting) assessments were performed by investigators blinded to
experimental group assignments.
Measurement of tissue loss Animals were euthanized and transcardially perfused with saline
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Frozen serial coronal sections (25 μm) were
sliced beginning +1.42 mm from bregma. Slices were immunohistochemically stained with
rabbit anti-MAP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit anti-NeuN (Millipore) antibodies. Tissue
loss was determined using Image J software by an observer blinded to group assignments. The
area of tissue loss was measured by subtracting the nonlesioned area of the ipsilateral hemisphere
from that of the contralateral hemisphere. The volume of tissue loss was calculated from the
lesion areas in seven sections spanning the rostrocaudal extent of the ischemic injury.
Rotarod test The Rotarod test was performed with the Rotamex 5 apparatus (Columbus
Instruments). Animals were placed on an accelerating rotating rod and the speed was increased
from 4 rpm (start speed) to 40 rpm (final speed) within 5 minutes. Mice were tested 3 times daily
with a break of at least 5 minutes between tests. The latency to fall off the rotating rod was
recorded by a blinded investigator. Data were expressed as the mean value from three trials.
Corner test Two black boards with dimensions of 30×20×1 cm3 were placed together at a 30°
angle. Mice were placed at the middle of the open side and trained to walk toward the corner.
When the mouse entered deep into the corner, it would turn backwards to leave the corner. The
non-ischemic mouse turned without side preference, whereas the ischemic mouse preferentially

turned toward the left side. Ten trials were performed for each mouse and the number of left
turns was recorded over the course of ten trials.
Foot fault test The foot fault test was performed to assess forelimb function. Mice gripped the
wire with their paws while moving on an elevated grid surface. A foot fault was recorded when
the paw fell or slipped between the wires. Every animal was tested by a blinded investigator for
three trials lasting 1 min each. The data were expressed as the number of errors made by the
limbs contralateral to the injured hemisphere as a percentage of total steps.
Morris water maze test A circular platform (11 cm diameter) was submerged in one quadrant of
a circular pool (109 cm diameter). The aim of the place navigation test is to assess the ability of
the mice to find the submerged platform by memorizing external spatial cues. During the test,
each mouse was put in the water in one of four quadrants and was allowed 60 seconds to find the
platform. When each trial ended, the mouse was placed on the platform for another 30 seconds to
help it remember the external spatial cues displayed around the room. Three trials were
performed per day with the platform present. Data from those trials are shown as the latency to
locate the hidden platform on each day and are in indirect proportion to spatial learning abilities.
A single 60 second probe test was performed on each mouse on the final day of testing. The
platform was removed and each mouse was placed at the same starting position in the pool and
allowed to swim for 60 seconds. The investigator then recorded the time spent in the target
quadrant, where the platform had previously been located. The latter measurements were
interpreted as spatial memory. All behavioral tests were carried out by researchers who were
blinded.
Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for mRNA quantification
Total RNA was extracted from cerebral tissues (ischemic hemisphere) using the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Superscript III rev transcript kit
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers’ protocols. The resulting cDNA was used for PCR
on a real-time PCR System (Bio-Rad). Primers for qRT-PCR were as follows: IL-4 forward
primer:
5'-GGTCTCAACCCCCAGCTAGT-3',
reverse
primer:
5'GCCGATGATCTCTCTCAAGTGAT-3';
IL-4R

5'TTTTCACAGGGGAGAAATCG-3';
GAPDH
forward
primer:
5'GTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGG-3'; reverse primer: 5'- GTTTCCCGTTGATGACCAG-3'. All
data were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels as an internal control.
Immunofluorescence staining Immunohistochemistry was performed on 25-μm free-floating
brain sections. Primary antibodies included the following: rabbit anti-NeuN (Millipore), goat
anti-CD206 (R&D Systems), rat anti-CD16 (BD Bioscience), and rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako).

Immunostaining was analyzed with confocal microscopy (Olympus). All images were processed
with Image J for the unbiased counting of automatically recognized cells by a blinded observer.
Means were calculated from three randomly selected microscopic fields in the cortex and
striatum of each section, and three consecutive sections were analyzed for each brain. Data are
expressed as mean numbers of cells per square millimeter.
Flow cytometry Single cell suspensions were prepared from sham or MCAO brains using the
neural tissue dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were stained with anti-mouse CD206, CD11b, CD45 and the appropriate isotype controls
(eBioscience). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACS flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
