The intact blood–brain barrier (BBB) is essential in maintaining a stabilized milieu for synaptic and neuronal functions. Disruptions of the BBB have been observed following ischemia and reperfusion, both in
patients and in animal models. Retinoic acid (RA), which plays crucial roles during vertebrate organogenesis, has been reported to participate in BBB development. However, it remains unclear whether RA
could prevent BBB disruption in ischemic stroke. In this study, we determined that the injection of RA
for 4 consecutive days resulted in increases in zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) expression, which are crucial components of the BBB structure. We demonstrated
that RA pretreatment could alleviate the ischemic stroke-induced enlargement of vascular permeability,
which is related to the up-regulated expression of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin proteins in rat models of middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Our ﬁndings further corroborated that the RA protective effect on BBB
is dependent on RA receptor ␣ in vitro oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment. Signiﬁcantly, RA
administration immediately after MCAO reduced tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and ameliorated neurological deﬁcits 24 h after ischemic stroke. Taken together,
our results suggest that RA may become a new therapeutic approach to prevent BBB dysfunction and
tPA-induced ICH in ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a specialized interface to separate the blood–brain barrier from neurons and acts as a regulator
of nutrient and iron transport and acts as a barrier to harmful
factors. The structure of the BBB is primarily composed of brain
endothelial cells (BEC), astrocyte end-feet and pericytes [1]. Studies
have demonstrated that the intricate junctional complex between
BEC, including several crucial proteins that tightly seal adjacent

BEC (claudin-5, Occludin, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and vascular
endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin)), is an important structure to
maintain BBB integrity and restrict paracellular permeability [2–5].
BBB destruction could directly alter the physiological neuronal
milieu, which is accompanied by neuroinﬂammatory responses,
oxidative stress and brain edema [6,7]. BBB destruction ultimately
contributes to synaptic and neuronal dysfunction and cognitive
changes [8,9]. In both animal and human studies, a compromised
BBB has been observed in ischemic stroke, which was caused
by thrombosis interrupting the blood–brain barrier ﬂow in the
brain vasculature [10–14]. Sufﬁcient evidence has shown that
several crucial proteins, including claudin-5, Occludin, ZO-1 and
VE-cadherin, were decreased after ischemia and reperfusion, which
might cause the disruption of the BBB [15–17].
Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), an effective thrombolytic
agent used to treat acute ischemic stroke, is approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [18,19]. A study has shown
that tPA could display its ﬁbrinolytic activity and signiﬁcantly
improve the neurological outcome in thromboembolic models [20].
However, clinical trials have indicated that only a few patients are
suitable for this drug treatment because of the risk of tPA-induced

126

intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) complications upon intravenous
injection [21]. Recent research has shown that tPA is both necessary and sufﬁcient to enlarge BBB permeability following cerebral
ischemia [11,22–24]. TPA activated platelet-derived growth factor ␣-receptors (PDGFR-␣) via PDGF-CC, which ultimately lead to
ICH. Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase antagonist, inhibited the activity
of PDGFR-␣ and reduced ICH complications associated with tPA
administration. However, clinical trials have revealed that imatinib
treatment could cause serious side effects, such as cardiotoxicity
and peripheral edema [25]. It remains unclear whether the systemic
administration of other drugs could directly prevent BBB disruption, minimize potential side effects, and eventually reduce the risk
of ICH due to tPA treatment in ischemic stroke.
Retinoic acid (RA) is a bioactive derivative of vitamin A [26] that
plays essential and pleiotropic roles in early organogenesis during
vertebrate development [27], including having distinct effects on
neurogenesis and angiogenesis [28–31]. Furthermore, one intriguing new study has reported that radial glial cell-derived RA is crucial
for BBB development in mouse embryos. Stimulation with RA for
48 h increased barrier formation in cultured human adult BEC by
inducing barrier-related gene expression, particularly ZO-1 and VEcadherin [32]. However, the role of RA in BBB disruption in an
ischemic stroke remains virtually unknown. In the current study,
our purpose is to investigate whether RA treatment could ameliorate BBB destruction and prevent tPA-induced ICH in rat middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke models.
2. Materials and methods

hemorrhage, rats received intraperitoneal injection of d-glucose
(6 ml/kg at 50% wt/vol) 15 min before ischemia, as previous studies
have proved that hyperglycemia could increase BBB permeability
and the risk of tPA-induced cerebral hemorrhage after ischemic
stroke [22,36,37].
2.3. RNA isolation and real-time quantitative PCR
Rat brains were removed immediately after 4 days of RA pretreatment. The dorsolateral cortex from the different groups was
dissected using a brain matrix (Braintree Scientiﬁc). TRIzol-A+ RNA
isolation reagent (Tiangen) was used to isolate total RNA, and
then cDNA was synthesized with the Revert Aid First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Fermentas), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primer sequences used were as follows: ZO-1 forward

a Cycler (Bio-Rad), and SYBR-Green (Roche) was used to quantify
the content of cDNA. The expression of each gene was normalized
to the level of ˇ-actin expression using the 2−CT method.

2.1. Animals
2.4. Analysis of cerebrovascular permeability
Male Sprague–Dawley rats, weighing 280–330 g, were used
in the experiments. Rats were maintained at 22 ◦ C under 12:12
light/dark cycles with abundant food and water. All procedures
complied with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Shandong University.
2.2. Stroke model and in vivo drug administration
Rats were subjected to a 90 min occlusion of the right middle
cerebral artery using an intraluminal model with minor modiﬁcations [33,34]. In short, the animals were anesthetized with
10% chloral-hydrate and a heating pad was used to maintain the
body temperature at 37.5 ± 0.5 ◦ C. The right common carotid artery
(CCA), external carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA)
were then exposed. A 3-0 monoﬁlament nylon suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co. Ltd., Beijing, China) was inserted into the ICA via the
ECA stump and traveled through the ICA for a distance of 18–19 mm
from the bifurcation. Reperfusion was performed by slowly removing the suture from the ECA. Both the ischemia and reperfusion
process were monitored by Laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (Perimed,
Stockholm, Sweden) to conﬁrm that MCAO was achieved.
Rats were placed in randomized groups that were treated
with either vehicle (polyethylene glycol, 0.9% NaCl and ethanol;
70%/20%/10% by volume) or RA (all-trans-RA; Sigma–Aldrich) [35].
Before surgery, rats in the RA and vehicle groups received intraperitoneal injections of RA (5 mg/kg/d body weight) or vehicle solution,
respectively, for 4 consecutive days. RA was injected after the onset
of MCAO and 10 h later to investigate the effect of RA treatment
after an ischemic stroke.
To investigate tPA-induced cerebral hemorrhage, human
recombinant tPA (Actilyse, Boehringer Ingelheim) or saline was
injected intravenously as a 1 mg/kg bolus 10 min before reperfusion, followed by a 9 mg/kg infusion over a 20 min interval using
a syringe infusion pump. To enhance the probability of cerebral

Alterations in cerebrovascular permeability after MCAO were
evaluated by the Evans blue (EB) assay. EB solution (4% in PBS,
2.5 ml/kg; Sigma–Aldrich) was administered intravenously 1 h after
reperfusion. Rats were perfused with saline and euthanized 4 h
later. Brains were quickly removed and separated into ischemic and
contralateral hemispheres. Each hemisphere was homogenized
with N,N-dimethylformamide (Sigma–Aldrich) and centrifuged
for 40 min at 25,000 × g. EB extravasation was quantiﬁed from
the supernatants by spectrophotometry at 620 nm as previously
described [23].
2.5. Quantiﬁcation of infarct volume
Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma–Aldrich) staining
was used to measure infarct volume as previously described [38].
Rats were sacriﬁced 5 h after reperfusion and their brains were
removed immediately and then sliced into 2.0-mm-thick coronal
sections with the help of a brain matrix. The ﬂash brain slices
were stained with 2% TTC for 30 min at 37 ◦ C and then ﬁxed in
4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Infarct tissue was not stained, but
visualized as white tissue, whereas the viable tissue was stained
red. Digital photographs were taken, and the infarct volume was
analyzed using Photoshop CS 5.0. The degree of brain damage was
corrected as previous described [39]. In each section, we obtained
the infarct area by subtracting the red area of the ipsilateral hemisphere from the total area of the contralateral hemisphere. The
total infarct volume for each animal was calculated by adding the
damaged area of all brain slices. The results were expressed as the
percentage of the total volume of the contralateral hemisphere.
2.6. Western blotting
Rats were euthanized 5 h after MCAO and brains were rapidly
removed. Ipsilateral penumbra cortex and matching tissue from

L. Kong et al. / Pharmacological Research 99 (2015) 125–136

sham-operated rats were dissected and homogenized in ice-cold
RIPA lysis buffer, including protease and phosphatase inhibitors
and centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4 ◦ C for 15 min. Protein quantiﬁcation was performed using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay
(Pierce Biotechnology, http://www.piercenet.com). Proteins were
resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and western blots were incubated with the following primary antibodies at 4 ◦ C overnight:
mouse anti-ZO-1 (Invitrogen, 1:200), rabbit anti-VE-cadherin
(Alexis, 1:1000), and rabbit anti-ˇ-actin (Cell Signaling Technology,
1:1000). The blots were incubated with the appropriate HRPconjugated secondary antibodies (Calbiochem, 1:5000), and the
blots were visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence system
(Millipore). The processed X-ray ﬁlms were scanned and the images
were analyzed for densitometry using the NIH ImageJ software.
2.7. Immunohistochemistry staining
To conﬁrm the expression of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin proteins,
brains were rapidly removed 5 h after ischemia and reperfusion,
coated with OCT compound and 10 ␮m coronal cryosections were
performed. Sections were ﬁxed with 4% formaldehyde for 5 min,
washed in PBS (pH 7.4) and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in PBS for 30 min. Next, the sections were incubated with
primary antibodies against mouse anti-ZO-1 (Invitrogen, 1:50 dilution) or rabbit anti-VE-cadherin (Alexis, 1:1000 dilution) for 24 h
at 4 ◦ C. After washing 4 times in PBS (10 min each), the slices were
incubated with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 or anti-rabbit Alexa
Fluor 594 for 1 h at room temperature. Images were obtained using
ﬂuorescent microscopy (Nikon 80i) and imaging program (NISElements BR, Nikon) and were processed using the NIH ImageJ
software. Setting a ﬂuorescence threshold value on the background
and calculating the ﬁelds with signal above the threshold quantiﬁed immunoreactivity. Five non-overlapping micrographs in the
peripheral penumbra were analyzed.
2.8. Cell cultures
The rat brain microvascular endothelial cell line RBE4 was
maintained in culture with 44% alpha-MEM and 44% F-10 Nutrient supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum,
1% of a penicillin/streptomycin solution, l-glutamine, geneticin
(G418), and ﬁbroblast growth factor. RBE4 were plated on collagen
(20 ␮g/mL in acetic acid 6 mM; Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology) coated dishes or transwells and kept at 37 ◦ C under 5% CO2
atmosphere.
2.9. RNA interference and transfection
Using speciﬁc siRNA oligonucleotides performed suppression of
ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression. The target sequences for each
of the genes were as follows: rat ZO-1, 5 GCA GCC ACC AUA CAG
GUA U3 ; rat VE-cadherin, 5 CCG UCA GAA UGC UAA GUA U3 ;
rat claudin-5,5 GCC UUC CUG GAC CAC AAU A3 . RBE4 cells were
transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent following the
manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). The expression levels of
corresponding genes in RBE4 cells transfected with the resulting
siRNA or the scrambled siRNA were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR 48 h later.
2.10. OGD treatment
To mimic ischemia-like conditions in vitro, RBE4 cells were subjected to OGD as previously described [40–42]. Brieﬂy, cells were
exposed to a modiﬁed glucose-free balanced salt solution (BSS).
Next, cells were maintained in a hypoxia chamber for 10 min preequilibrated with 5% CO2 and 95% N2 . Subsequently chamber was

127

sealed and kept at 37 ◦ C for another 110 min. After OGD, BSS in
each dish was supplemented with glucose and heat inactivated
fetal bovine serum. RBE4 cells were incubated at 37 ◦ C under 5%
CO2 atmosphere for following experiments.
2.11. Paracellular permeability in vitro
RBE4 monolayer cells permeability to ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)–dextran (40,000 Mr; Sigma; ﬁnal concentration 1 mg/mL)
was assessed using collagen-coated PTFE membranes 24-well cell
cultures inserts (0.4-␮m transwell pore size, Costar). For OGD
experiments, RBE4 cells were stimulated with 5 ␮M RA or vehicle and different RA receptor (RAR) antagonist 48 h before OGD.
Selectively RAR␣ antagonist ER50891 was purchased from Tocris
Bioscience (ﬁnal concentration 10 ␮M). Combination of LE135
(Tocris Bioscience) and LE540 (Wako Pure Chemicals) were used
as RAR␤ antagonist (ﬁnal concentration 5 ␮M) [43]. FITC–dextran
was added to the upper chamber immediately after OGD. For
siRNA transfection experiments, FITC–dextran was treated after
transfection for 2 days. 50 ␮L samples were taken from the lower
compartment 1 h after FITC–dextran treatment. The ﬂuorescence
intensity of the samples was measured with a ﬂuorescence reader
at an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 530 nm (Thermo
Scientiﬁc Varioskan® Flash) [44].

2.12. Quantiﬁcation of brain hemorrhage after stroke
Following behavioral measurements 24 h after MCAO, the brains
were removed and separated into ischemic ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Each hemisphere was fully homogenized
in an equal volume of ice-cold PBS and centrifuged at 25,000 × g
at 4 ◦ C for 1 min. Triton X-100 stock solution was added to a ﬁnal
concentration of 0.5%. The homogenate was mixed for 5 min and
centrifuged at 25,000 × g at 4 ◦ C for 30 min. The supernatant was
collected and the absorbance at A410 nm was measured in a spectrophotometer. Finally, the extraction solutions from hemorrhage
in the different groups were quantiﬁed by comparison with a
standard curve made using homologous blood–brain barrier as previous described [22,45,46].

2.13. Behavioral measurements
A modiﬁed 0–4 point scale neurological score was used to evaluate behavioral deﬁcits 24 h after MCAO [38,47]. Rats were held
gently by their tails and suspended vertically 20 cm above the table.
The rats were scored blindly as follows: 0, no observable neurological dysfunction; 1, rats failed to completely extend left forepaws;
2, rats displayed attenuated resistance to a lateral push toward the
paretic side without circling; 3, rats showed spontaneous circling
to the contralateral side accompanied by a reduced resistance to
lateral push; and 4, loss of spontaneous motor activity or unconsciousness.
The tape removal test was performed 24 h after MCAO to assess
forepaw sensorimotor deﬁcits [48,49]. Rats were placed into a box
(50 cm × 50 cm) with a transparent bottom for 60 s. Two equal
length adhesive tapes (113.1 mm2 ) were quickly attached at the
distal-radial region of 2 forelimbs, and then the rats were placed
into the box. The time that it took for an animal to remove the
tapes from each forelimb was recorded by a camera installed under
the box. A rat was tested every 5 min for a total of three times.
If an animal could not remove the tapes within 180 s, then time
was noted as 180 s. Rats were trained before surgery for 3 days to
make sure there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between
groups.

2.14. Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical program
(version 19.0). All of the results were analyzed by Student’s t test
or one-way or two-way repeated ANOVA, followed by the LSD or
Dunnett’s T3 post hoc test to compare differences between multiple
groups spontaneously. Values in the results were presented as the
mean ± SEM and signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. RA pretreatment attenuated early BBB permeability and
infarction caused by MCAO following reperfusion
Previous studies reported that RA promoted barrier formation
of cultured brain endothelial cells (BEC) by increasing the expression of BBB-related genes [32,50]. In this study, to investigate
whether RA could regulate these genes expression in vivo, dorsolateral cortex region of rat was obtained to quantify mRNA levels
of several BBB-speciﬁc genes (Claudin-5, Occludin, PECAM-1, ZO-1
and VE-cadherin) after intraperitoneal injection of RA for 4 consecutive days. The results showed that only ZO-1 and VE-cadherin
expression was signiﬁcantly increased after treatment with either
5 or 25 mg/kg RA compared with the vehicle group (one-way
ANOVA: ZO-1, F(4,24) = 10.574, p < 0.001; VE-cadherin, F(4,24) = 7.103,
p = 0.001) (Fig. 1A, B). The mRNA levels of Claudin-5, Occludin and
PECAM-1 have not changed signiﬁcantly between different doses
of RA treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. 1A). To avoid potential
chronic toxicity with high doses of RA, such as bone loss and hair
loss [51,52], rats were treated with 5 mg/kg of RA in all following
experiments.
The effects of RA pretreatment on ischemic stroke-induced BBB
disruption were investigated. MCAO was chosen as the ischemic
stroke model for our experiments. To ensure the stability of our
MCAO model, the processes of ischemia and reperfusion were monitored by Laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden).
We intravenously injected Evans blue (EB) dye 1 h after MCAO and
quantiﬁed the leakage of EB dye into ipsilateral and contralateral
hemispheres, respectively, 4 h later to reﬂect BBB disruption. Our
results revealed that the extravasation of EB dye was strikingly
increased 5 h after MCAO in the vehicle group, whereas rats in the
sham group showed almost no extravasation (Supplementary Fig.
1B), which suggested that the BBB was disrupted within 5 h of the
onset of MCAO (Fig. 1C). RA pretreatment for 4 days signiﬁcantly
decreased of the extravasation of the EB dye compared with the
vehicle group after MCAO, which suggested that RA could attenuate BBB breakdown after ischemic stroke (Student’s t test: p < 0.05)
(Fig. 1C, D).
In fact, compromise of the BBB has been described as having a
role in neuronal damage, whereas protection of the BBB ameliorated infarction area and neurological deﬁcits in stroke [53,54]. To
test whether the BBB protective effect of RA could subsequently
result in a neuroprotective effect, cerebral infarction was measured by TTC staining 5 h after MCAO. The analysis showed that
no infarction area was observed in sham rats (Supplementary Fig.
1C). RA pretreatment signiﬁcantly reduced the infarction area compared with the vehicle group after MCAO (Student’s t test: p < 0.01)
(Fig. 1E, F). Previous studies reported that RA could reduce cerebral
infarction in ischemic stroke through different mechanisms by upregulating several neurogenic factors, such as neurogranin [35]. We
postulated that RA could exert neuroprotective effects by multiple
mechanisms, including RA-regulated BBB protection.
To investigate the effect of RA on tPA-induced intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH) following MCAO, a typical animal model by injection of d-glucose to increase the extent of hemorrhage was used

[22]. Because ICH complications may be due to the directly negative effect of tPA on BBB destruction, the protective effects of RA
on tPA-induced aggravation of BBB permeability following MCAO
were investigated ﬁrst. Our results showed that RA alone signiﬁcantly decreased extravasation of EB dye and TPA administration
intravenously resulted in a substantial increase of extravasation of EB dye, compared with vehicle-treated group following
ischemic stroke (two-way ANOVA: RA, F(1,22) = 22.578, p < 0.01,
tPA, F(1,22) = 13.501, p < 0.01, interaction, F(1,22) = 0.123, p = 0.729)
(Fig. 1G, H). It is worth noting that additional 40% extravasation of
Evans blue dye was detected in the vehicle-treated group compared
with previous MCAO group in Fig. 1C due to injection of d-glucose,
which could promote BBB dysfunction in both ischemic stroke rats
and in vitro BBB models as demonstrated in the previous studies
[55–57]. Although the interaction analysis showed that there was
no signiﬁcant RA × tPA interaction effect in the BBB permeability,
pretreatment with RA signiﬁcantly decreased tPA-aggravated BBB
permeability in ischemic stroke rats (post hoc: p < 0.01) (Fig. 1G, H).
Brieﬂy, our results showed that RA pretreatment reduced BBB
disruption and lessened cerebral infarction at the early stage of BBB
opening after ischemic stroke, which suggested that RA could be an
effective BBB protection agent to treat ischemic stroke.
3.2. RA pretreatment blocked the MCAO-induced decrease of
ZO-1 and VE-cadherin proteins
The reduction of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression participated
in BBB disruption at the early stage of BBB opening after an ischemic
stroke [58]. It has been observed that RA up-regulates the mRNA
levels of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin in naïve rats. Whether RA could
block the decrease of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin proteins in ischemic
stroke remains unknown. Expression of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin proteins following MCAO was examined by using western blot and
immunohistochemical staining. MCAO signiﬁcantly reduced ZO-1
and VE-cadherin levels and pretreatment with RA for 4 consecutive days signiﬁcantly enhanced ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression
compared with vehicle treated rats in the sham group (two-way
ANOVA: ZO-1, MCAO, F(1,19) = 53.708, p < 0.01, RA, F(1,19) = 16.185,
p < 0.01, interaction, F(1,19) = 0.073, p = 0.79; VE-cadherin, MCAO,
F(1,19) = 52.747, p < 0.01, RA, F(1,19) = 20.816, p < 0.01, interaction,
F(1,19) = 0.839, p = 0.371) (Fig. 2A, B). Although the interaction analysis showed that there was no signiﬁcant MCAO × RA interaction
effect in ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression, pretreatment with RA
for 4 consecutive days signiﬁcantly reversed the MCAO-induced
reduction of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin proteins compared with MCAO
alone treated group (post hoc: p < 0.05) (Fig. 2A, B). Correspondingly, immunohistochemical staining further veriﬁed our western
blot results by showing that RA pretreatment signiﬁcantly prevented the decreased in both ZO-1 and VE-cadherin in MCAO
rats, compared to the only MCAO group (two-way ANOVA: ZO-1,
MCAO, F(1,13) = 39.8, p < 0.01, RA, F(1,13) = 24.938, p < 0.01, interaction, F(1,13) = 2.486, p = 0.139; VE-cadherin, MCAO, F(1,13) = 27.04,
p < 0.01, RA, F(1,13) = 18.759, p < 0.01, interaction, F(1,13) = 0.538,
p = 0.476; post hoc: ZO-1, p < 0.05, VE-cadherin, p < 0.05) (Fig. 2C,
D). In brief, we demonstrated that RA rescued the decrease of ZO-1
and VE-cadherin at the early stage of BBB opening after ischemic
stroke, which might correlate with alleviating BBB disruption.
3.3. The protective effect of RA on BBB is dependent on expression
of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin in cultured RBE4 cells
To investigate the signaling studies of RA protective effect on
BBB, the cultured rat brain microvascular endothelial cell line
RBE4 was treated with vehicle or RA and different RA receptor
(RAR) antagonists 48 h before oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)
treatment. Our results showed that RA signiﬁcantly decreased

veriﬁed RA protective effect on BBB in vitro (post hoc: p < 0.05)
(Fig. 3A). Selective RAR␣ antagonist ER50891 alone has no effect on
FITC–dextran diffusion. Although the interaction analysis showed
that there was no signiﬁcant RA × RAR␣ interaction effect in the
FITC–dextran diffusion measurement (two-way ANOVA: interaction, F(1,8) = 2.763, p = 0.135), RA co-treatment with ER50891 could
reverse RA-induced decrease of BBB permeability and have no
signiﬁcant difference compared with ER50891 treatment alone

(Fig. 3A). This suggested that RAR␣ antagonist could block RA
protective effect on BBB. The combination of LE135 and LE540
was used as a selective RAR␤ antagonist. There was no signiﬁcant
RA × RAR␤ interaction effect in the FITC–dextran diffusion measurement (two-way ANOVA: interaction, F(1,8) = 0.082, p = 0.782).
RA co-treatment with the combination of LE135 and LE540 still
had a signiﬁcant decrease of BBB permeability compared with
the combination of LE135 and LE540 treatment alone, which suggested that RAR␤ antagonist could not impair RA protective effect

effect in the expression of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin (two-way ANOVA:
ZO-1, interaction, F(1,8) = 11.955, p < 0.01; VE-cadherin, interaction,
F(1,8) = 33.165, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3B). RA could signiﬁcantly enhance
expression of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin (post hoc: ZO-1, p < 0.01;
VE-cadherin, p < 0.01) and ER50891 alone showed no signiﬁcant
difference compared with vehicle group (Fig. 3B). Crucially, RA cotreatment with ER50891 has no signiﬁcant effect compared with
ER50891 treatment alone, which suggested that ER50891 could
abolish RA-induced increase of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression
(Fig. 3B). There was no signiﬁcant RA × RAR␤ interaction effect
in the expression of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin (two-way ANOVA:
ZO-1, interaction, F(1,8) = 0.565, p = 0.474; VE-cadherin, interaction,
F(1,8) = 0.39, p = 0.55). RA co-treatment with the RAR␤ antagonists

could not impair RA protective effect on BBB compared with RAR␤
antagonists treatment alone (post hoc: ZO-1, p < 0.01; VE-cadherin,
p < 0.01) (Fig. 3D). In addition, stimulation of RA has no signiﬁcant
effect on claudin-5 expression in cultured RBE4 cells (Fig. 3B, D).
Therefore, our experiments demonstrated that RA action on BBB is
dependent on RAR␣.
To examine whether RA protective action on BBB is dependent
on ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression, ZO-1 and VE-cadherin siRNA
oligonucleotides was used in the following experiments. To analyze the data, we deﬁned the vehicle or RA as RA factor and the
scramble siRNA or ZO-1 siRNA as ZO-1 factor. In our experiments,
compared with vehicle/scramble siRNA group, FITC–dextran diffusion was signiﬁcantly decreased in RA treatment group (post hoc:
p < 0.01) and increased in ZO-1 siRNA treatment group (post hoc:
p < 0.01), suggesting that RA could promote the formation of an

endothelial barrier and a knockdown of ZO-1 could disrupt the
endothelial barrier (Fig. 3F). Furthermore, the interaction analysis
showed that there was a signiﬁcant RA × ZO-1 interaction effect in
the FITC–dextran diffusion measurement, suggesting that knockdown of ZO-1 could partially abolish RA protective effect on BBB
(two-way ANOVA: interaction, F(1,8) = 32.988, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3F).
We also performed similar experiments by using VE-cadherin and
claudin-5 siRNA. Our results showed that a knockdown of VEcadherin, but not claudin-5, could partially abolish RA action, as
well (two-way ANOVA: VE-cadherin, interaction, F(1,8) = 16.465,
p < 0.01; claudin-5, interaction, F(1,8) = 3.642, p = 0.093) (Fig. 3G, H).
Taken together, these results demonstrated that RA protective
effect on BBB is dependent on ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression.

3.4. Effects of RA injection immediately after MCAO on
tPA-induced ICH and neurological injury at 24 h post reperfusion
following MCAO
To investigate the effect of RA on tPA-induced ICH following
MCAO, a typical animal model using d-glucose injection was used
to increase the extent of hemorrhage [22,37]. Because ICH complications may directly result from the negative effect of tPA on early
BBB destruction, we further examined whether RA treatment after
MCAO could reduce tPA-induced ICH using a spectrophotometric
hemoglobin assay. RA was injected immediately after the onset of
MCAO and again 10 h later (Fig. 4A). There was a signiﬁcant RA × tPA
interaction effect in hemorrhage volume measurement (two-way

assay in each group (n = 7–8 per group; errors represent S.E.M., **p < 0.01, versus

ANOVA: RA, F(1,27) = 11.621, p < 0.01; tPA, F(1,27) = 60.14, p < 0.01,
interaction, F(1,27) = 8.117, p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). We determined that
a slight hemorrhage volume was detected in the vehicle-treated
group 24 h after MCAO ischemic stroke. However, tPA treatment
following ischemic stroke resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in
hemorrhage compared with the vehicle group (post hoc: p < 0.01)
(Fig. 4B). RA treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the tPA-aggravated
hemorrhage volume, which suggested that RA treatment could alleviate tPA-induced ICH and enhance the security of tPA application
in MCAO ischemic stroke (post hoc: p < 0.01) (Fig. 4B). In addition, rats that were treated with d-glucose alone had no signiﬁcant
change in hemorrhage volume in our experiments (Supplementary
Fig. 2).
Evidence has shown that RA can induce BBB differentiation
and the expression of the BBB marker, P-glycoprotein, within 24 h
in a cultured rat brain-derived endothelial cell line [59]. Studies
have reported that administration of tPA after ischemia aggravated the degradation of ZO-1, Claudin-5 and VE-cadherin [17].
Therefore, we investigated the effect of RA treatment after the
onset of MCAO on the tPA-aggravated decrease of ZO-1 and VEcadherin 24 h after treatment using Western blot analysis and
immunohistochemical staining. Our Western blot results showed
that both the ZO-1 and VE-cadherin proteins were signiﬁcantly
decreased after tPA administration compared with the vehicle
group following MCAO (post hoc: ZO-1, p < 0.01, VE-cadherin,
p < 0.01) (Fig. 5A, B). There was no signiﬁcant RA × tPA interaction effect in ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression (two-way ANOVA:
ZO-1, interaction, F(1,21) = 0.954, p = 0.34; VE-cadherin, interaction,
F(1,21) = 0.444, p = 0.512) (Fig. 5A, B). However, combining RA with

tPA preserved the expression of the ZO-1 and VE-cadherin proteins
to 24 h after ischemia, when compared with tPA treatment alone
(post hoc: ZO-1, p < 0.05, VE-cadherin, p < 0.05). Correspondingly,
immunohistochemical staining veriﬁed our Western blot results
by showing that RA treatment after the onset of MCAO and again
10 h later signiﬁcantly prevented tPA-triggered decrease of ZO-1
and VE-cadherin, compared to the tPA-treated alone group following ischemic stroke (post hoc: ZO-1, p < 0.05, VE-cadherin, p < 0.05)
(Fig. 5C, D). In brief, we found that combining RA with tPA after
the onset of MCAO distinctly reduced hemorrhage volume, which
might be partially dependent on the effects of RA up-regulating
ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression.
To investigate the effects of RA treatment on tPA-aggravated
neurological injury 24 h after MCAO, neuronal behavior tests were
performed. Neurological scores (0–4 point) and the tape removal
test were used in our experiments. We found that rats in the sham
group achieved a score of 0. Rats in the MCAO ischemic stroke group
scored much higher at 2.8 (Fig. 6A). RA treatment reduced MCAO
ischemic stroke-induced behavior deﬁcits from 2.8 to 1.9 (post
hoc: p < 0.05). TPA treatment resulted in more severe neurological
deﬁcits following ischemic stroke and the rats scored 3.6 points
(post hoc: p < 0.05). Although there was no signiﬁcant RA × tPA
interaction effect in neurological scores (two-way ANOVA: interaction, F(1,27) = 0.139, p = 0.712), RA treatment signiﬁcantly attenuated
the tPA-aggravated neurological deﬁcits after MCAO such that the
average score was reduced from 3.6 to 2.6 (post hoc: p < 0.01)
(Fig. 6A).
Meanwhile, the sensorimotor function of rats was evaluated
using the tape removal assay following the examination of the
neurological score. The latency of tape removal was recorded. The
results showed that the latency was only approximately 11 ± 3 s
in the sham group and that there was no signiﬁcant difference
compared with the naïve rats scored at 10 ± 2 s. Ischemic stroke
increased the latency to 138 ± 8 s, indicating that MCAO caused a
medium level of sensorimotor impairment (Fig. 6B). RA treatment
signiﬁcantly decreased the latency to 89 ± 15 s after MCAO (post
hoc: p < 0.01), which suggested that RA treatment could protect
rats from MCAO ischemic stroke-induced sensorimotor deﬁcits.
TPA treatment after MCAO insult caused a further increase in the
latency to 173 ± 5 s (post hoc: p < 0.05), suggesting that tPA treatment could further aggravate the sensorimotor impairments. There
was no signiﬁcant RA × tPA interaction effect in tape removal test
(two-way ANOVA: interaction, F(1,27) = 0.039, p = 0.845). However,
RA treatment remarkably reduced the tPA-induced increase in
latency to 119 ± 8 s (post hoc: p < 0.01). Collectively, our results
demonstrated that RA treatment after the onset of MCAO significantly relieved tPA-induced ICH and neurological injury 24 h after
ischemic stroke, which suggested that RA could be used together
with tPA to enhance the security of tPA application in ischemic
stroke.

4. Discussion
The dysfunction of BBB plays a key role in ischemic stroke in
both human and animal studies [9,11,60]. Protection of the BBB
is deemed to be a novel therapy for the treatment of ischemic
stroke. Our results provided several new insights on the protective effects of RA on ischemic stroke-induced BBB disruption. We
observed that RA pretreatment could signiﬁcantly lessen early BBB
disruption after ischemic stroke, which was closely related to the
up-regulation of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression. Our in vitro
experiments demonstrated that RA increased endothelial barrier
via RAR␣ under OGD condition. Further study showed that knockdown ZO-1 or VE-cadherin could partially prevent RA increased
endothelial barrier. Moreover, we demonstrated that RA injection

immediately after the onset of ischemia could signiﬁcantly attenuate tPA-induced hemorrhage and neurological deﬁcits after MCAO
ischemic stroke, which is related to the protective effect of RA on
the tPA-induced decrease in ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression.
First, we found that RA pretreatment could protect against
ischemic stroke-induced BBB injury. Several studies have shown
that BBB disruption is generally an ingravescent process in an
ischemic stroke [15]. Early BBB destruction caused by the degradation of junction proteins changed the vascular permeability and
disrupted normal ion homeostasis within the CNS, which further
caused an increase in cerebral edema and cell death [8]. According to our results, increased cerebrovascular permeability was

detected within 5 h after reperfusion by intravenous injection of
EB. In addition, clinical trials have conﬁrmed that BBB disruption
is correlated with post-thrombolysis hemorrhagic transformation
[60–62]. Therefore, BBB protection should be a top priority after
ischemic stroke. RA, a bioactive derivative of vitamin A and a crucial differentiation factor during vertebrate development, has been
found to participate in both neuronal and vascular development
[28,29,31,63]. A growing body of evidence further demonstrated
that RA signaling provides an important mechanism for the
regulation of BBB development in the neurovascular system of
mouse embryos [32]. However, the effects of RA in stroke-induced
BBB damage in adults remain unknown. We showed that RA

pretreatment signiﬁcantly alleviated BBB permeability within 5 h
after MCAO ischemic stroke, which suggested that RA pretreatment
could prevent ischemic stroke-induced BBB dysfunction at early
stages after reperfusion.
Recent studies have emphasized that a holistic neurovascular protection strategy should be a substitute for the traditional
and solely neuroprotective strategy in stroke treatment [11,53].
BBB protection, which maintains the normal neuronal and vascular function, has been considered to be a novel therapeutic
approach to prevent neuronal damage in stroke [54]. In our present
study, RA pretreatment remarkably decreased the infarction area
5 h after reperfusion, suggesting that the ameliorative BBB by RA
pretreatment effectively prevented neuronal damage in ischemic
stroke. According to previous studies, RA reduced infarct volume by
enhancing the expression of several growth or neurogenic factors,
such as midkine, neurogranin, or bone morphogenetic protein-7,
at 24 h after reperfusion [35,64,65]. We demonstrated that the
comprehensive effects of RA on both BBB protection and the upregulation of crucial growth or neurogenic factors contribute to
neuroprotective function.
We next investigated the potential mechanism of RA protective effects on the BBB in ischemic stroke. The intact junctional
complex between cerebrovascular endothelial cells plays crucial
roles in the permeability of BBB. ZO-1 and VE-cadherin are two
indispensable proteins of the junctional complex [5,8]. Our in vivo
experiments showed that pretreatment with 5 mg/kg RA for 4 consecutive days enhanced the transcription and expression of ZO-1
and VE-cadherin at both the mRNA and protein levels compared
with the naïve rats in the vehicle group. A recent study has shown
that RA stimulation of the cultured human BEC hCMEC/D3 cells
for 48 h could increase the expression of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin
proteins. We extended this in vitro ﬁnding to the in vivo level
[32]. These results suggested that RA might participate in the

modulation of BBB permeability in adult rats by regulating barrierrelated genes expression. Further evidence showed that a reduction
of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin proteins was detected after ischemic
stroke, which may lead to early BBB disruption [58]. Our results
indicated that MCAO signiﬁcantly decreased ZO-1 and VE-cadherin
protein levels 5 h after reperfusion in the vehicle group and RA
pretreatment could obviously block the reduction of ZO-1 and
VE-cadherin proteins following ischemic stroke. Therefore, RA pretreatment alleviation of early BBB disruption may be related to its
effect on blocking the ischemic stroke-triggered decrease in ZO-1
and VE-cadherin levels.
Furthermore, we found that RAR␣ antagonist could block RAinduced decrease of BBB permeability and increase of ZO-1 and
VE-cadherin expression under OGD condition in cultured RBE4
monolayer endothelial cells. Although previous study has showed
that RA induces BBB formation via RAR␤ during embryonic development [32], our results showed that RAR␤ antagonist could not
impair RA protective effect on BBB under OGD treatment. This
suggested that RAR␣ may participate in RA protective effect on
adult BBB. Meanwhile, a knockdown ZO-1 or VE-cadherin reduced
RA increased barrier in cultured RBE4 cells. However, suppression claudin-5 expression could not impair RA-induced decrease
of RBE4 permeability. Combined with our real-time PCR results
that RA specially increases expression of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin,
but not claudin-5, we concluded that RA might protect BBB through
increasing ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression.
Second, our data indicated that RA administration after the onset
of ischemia signiﬁcantly ameliorated tPA-induced hemorrhage. It
is clear that tPA is both necessary and sufﬁcient to enlarge BBB
permeability at the early stage of BBB opening [22,23]. An intraventricular injection of tPA, rather than an intravenous infusion,
could signiﬁcantly increase cerebrovascular permeability in naïve
animals. However, the greatly increased BBB permeability was
detected in the MCAO ischemic stroke rats by intravenous injection of tPA. These studies indicated that tPA injection could largely
aggravate BBB disruption. We revealed that RA treatment signiﬁcantly reduced tPA-induced IHC 24 h after MCAO ischemic stroke.
Meanwhile, we determined that RA could prevent the tPAaggravated decrease of ZO-1 and VE-cadherin after MCAO ischemic
stroke. To a certain extent, the protective effect of RA on tPAinduced ICH is closely correlated with preserving the expression of
ZO-1 and VE-cadherin. Evidence has shown that tPA injection could
increase neurological deﬁcits in an MCAO ischemic stroke model.
Our results demonstrated that RA treatment could signiﬁcantly
ameliorate the tPA-aggravated neurological injury. Importantly,
systemic administration of RA, and not intraventricular injection, is
a practical and effective approach that could promote BBB protection. Therefore, RA treatment could extend the time window and
ensure the security of tPA treatment in ischemic stroke patients.
In summary, our studies provided evidence that RA treatment
elevated ZO-1 and VE-cadherin expression and attenuated early
BBB disruption after ischemic stroke. Notably, the protective effect
of RA on the BBB further reduced the tPA-induced cerebral hemorrhage in ischemic stroke. Finally, future developmental clinical
experiments may identify RA as a potential target for neurovascular
diseases.
