Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been reported to exacerbate stroke outcome in experimental models. Cystathionine b-synthase
(CBS) has been implicated as the predominant H2S-producing enzyme in central nervous system. When SH-SY5Y cells were
transfected to overexpress CBS, these cells were able to synthesize H2S when exposed to high levels of enzyme substrates
but not substrate concentrations that may reflect normal physiological conditions. At the same time, these cells demonstrated exacerbated cell death when subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) together with high substrate
concentrations, indicating that H2S production has a detrimental effect on cell survival. This effect could be abolished by CBS
inhibition. The same effect was observed with primary astrocytes exposed to OGD and high substrates or sodium hydrosulfide. In addition, CBS was upregulated and activated by truncation in primary astrocytes subjected to OGD. When rats
were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, CBS activation was also observed. These results imply that in
acute ischemic conditions, CBS is upregulated and activated by truncation causing an increased production of H2S, which
exacerbate the ischemic injuries. Therefore, CBS inhibition may be a viable approach to stroke treatment.

Introduction
Hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) has been known as a toxic gas
for more than a century due to its reversible inhibition
of cytochrome c oxidase (Beauchamp et al., 1984;
Reiﬀenstein et al., 1992; Dorman et al., 2002). In
recent years, it has been recognized that H2S functions
as a signaling molecule in the central nervous system
(CNS), involving in the regulation of ion channels, neurotransmitter functions, and other intracellular signaling
molecules such as tyrosine kinases (Abe and Kimura,
1996; Tan et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012). Current evidence
suggests that H2S is predominantly produced in the
CNS by cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) using cysteine
(Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy) as substrates (Abe and
Kimura, 1996; Chen et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2009).
CBS is heme and pyridoxal-50 phosphate dependent. It is
predominantly expressed in astrocytes (Enokido et al.,
2005; Lee et al., 2009) but has also been reported to be

expressed in Purkinje cells and Ammon’s horn neurons
(Robert et al., 2003).
Cys has been reported as a risk factor for coronary
heart disease (Xiao et al., 2011), while Hcy is known as
a risk factor for stroke (Hankey, 2006). A prospective
study showed that total Hcy concentration was signiﬁcantly higher in stroke cases than in controls (geometric

mean 13.7 vs. 11.9 lM; Perry et al., 1995). Interestingly,
high Hcy concentration in blood of ischemic stroke
patients is associated with a negative inﬂuence on
stroke outcome (Pniewski et al., 2003). Similarly, high
plasma Cys levels on admission before treatment also
correlated signiﬁcantly with poor clinical outcome
assessed at 3 months post stroke (Wong et al., 2006).
These ﬁndings implicated a clinical relevance of Hcy
and Cys in ischemic stroke outcome. In addition, Cys is
a substrate for g-glutamylcysteine synthetase, which catalyzes the ﬁrst reaction in the biosynthesis of glutathione
(GSH), a major cellular antioxidant known to protect
cells from oxidative damage mainly through the action
of GSH peroxidase (Cohen and Hochstein, 1963; Meister
and Anderson, 1983). This reaction is ATP dependent
and therefore GSH will be depleted following ATP depletion. This may contribute to an increase in Cys level
under ischemic conditions.
In animal studies, Qu et al. (2006) reported that H2S
was increased in the cerebral cortex at 24 hr after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), a rat
stroke model. The H2S level was further increased by
Cys administration. Pretreatment with Cys increased
the infarct volume following pMCAO, while the inhibition of H2S synthesis by CBS inhibitors reduced infarct
volume. Moreover, sodium hydrosulﬁde (NaHS, an H2S
donor) could mimic the eﬀects of Cys pretreatment.
These results suggested that in ischemia, H2S production
increases through increased availability of Cys and
increased H2S worsens ischemic injuries, based on both
histological and functional assessments (Qu et al., 2006).
Therefore, suppression of H2S production via the inhibition of CBS activity may be an attractive approach to
improve stroke outcome during the acute phase of ischemic stroke. However, inhibition studies were performed
using nonselective inhibitors of CBS (Asimakopoulou
et al., 2013). An often used inhibitor, aminooxyacetic
acid (AOAA) also inhibits cystathioine g-lyase (CSE)
and other enzymes like g-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
transaminase (Loscher, 1981). Furthermore, the possibility of pleiotropic eﬀects of these inhibitors in inﬂuencing
stroke outcome cannot be entirely ruled out.
In order to further establish if the overproduction of
endogenous H2S leads to enhanced cell death under ischemic conditions, we overexpressed CBS in undiﬀerentiated
neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Enhanced cell death was
observed when the cells were subjected to oxygen and
glucose deprivation (OGD) in the presence of Cys and
Hcy. The same was then observed in primary astrocytes
albeit to a lesser extent. In addition, we found that OGD
rapidly increased the expression of CBS in primary astrocytes and in rat brains subjected to pMCAO. Hence, we
provide evidence that upregulation of CBS expression
exacerbates the outcome of stroke most likely through
increased H2S production.

Methods
Ethics Statement
All animal experimental procedures in this study
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the National University of
Singapore.

Cell Culture
Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line was obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell were
maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
(DMEM)/F12 (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Invitrogen, USA)
and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen,
USA) at 37  C and incubated in a humidiﬁed atmosphere
with 95% air/5% CO2.

Primary Culture of Rat Cortical Astrocyte
Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from the
cerebral cortices of 1- to 2-day old Sprague-Dawley
rat pups as described previously (Lu et al., 2008)
with minor modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, the cerebral cortices
were harvested and digested with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco,
Invitrogen, USA) at 37  C. The cells were seeded onto
poly-L-lysine-coated ﬂask with DMEM/F12 (Gibco,
Invitrogen, USA) medium supplemented with 10%
FBS (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA) and 1% penicillin–
streptomycin (Gibco, Invitrogen, USA). The cultures
were maintained at 37  C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere
with 95% air/5% CO2. Culture medium was replaced
72 hr later and changed medium twice weekly
thereafter. At 10 to 12 days, the conﬂuent cultures
were shaken overnight to minimize microglia contamination. The remaining astrocyte monolayers were cultured until Day 21.

Construction of Rat CBS Lentiviral
Expression Vectors
Total RNA was isolated from rat PC12 cells using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was
synthesized from total RNA using the RevertAid H
Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas/
Thermo Scientiﬁc). CBS coding region was isolated by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the cDNA using
PrimeStar GXL DNA Polymerase (Clontech) with a SalI
site-containing forward (50 CGCGTCGACCATG
CCTTCAGGGACATCC 30 ) and BamHI site-containing
reverse (GCGGATCCTATTTCCGGGTCTGCTCAC)
primers. Ampliﬁed product was digested with
SalI and BamHI and inserted in-frame 30 to a myc-tag
sequence in pL6mCWmycIE lentiviral vector to

give pL6mCWmycCBSIE. pLenti6mCWmycIE was modiﬁed from pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO (Invitrogen) by reengineering the multiple cloning site, insertion of the cPPT
and WPRE elements, and insertion of the N-terminal
myc tag coding sequence and IRES-EGFP reporter
cassette.

Lentivirus Particle Production and Cell Transduction
Lentivirus packaging was performed in 293FT cells
according to the protocol provided with the
ViraPowerTM
Lentiviral
Directional
TOPOÕ
Expression Kit (Invitrogen). Lentivirus particles were
harvested from cell culture supernatant according to
the protocol of Deiseroth Lab (http://www.stanford.
edu/group/dlab/resources/lvprotocol.pdf).
Lentivirus
harboring the CBS expression constructs was used to
transduce undiﬀerentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Prior to
transduction, cells were cultured to 90% conﬂuence.
Concentrated virus particle was added to cell culture
medium containing 8 lg/ml of Polybrene (Sigma
Aldrich). Where long-term expression of transgene
was needed, antibiotic selection was applied by
adding Blasticidin S (Invitrogen) at a ﬁnal concentration of 10 lg/ml to the medium. Expression of transgene was visualized by EGFP ﬂuorescence.

Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation
OGD was achieved by incubating the SH-SY5Y cells with
and without CBS overexpression in glucose-free DMEM
with 1% streptomycin/penicillin in a hypoxia chamber
(1% O2/5% CO2/94% N2) for 24 hr at 37  C in a humidiﬁed incubator. OGD for primary cortical astrocyte
culture was achieved by incubating the primary astrocytes
in glucose-free DMEM with 1% streptomycin/penicillin
in a hypoxia chamber (5% CO2/95% N2) from 0.5 to 8 hr
at 37  C in a humidiﬁed incubator. For NaHS treatment,
primary astrocytes were seeded onto 96-well plate overnight. The regular medium was replaced with OGD
medium supplemented with vehicle or NaHS at 100
or 300 mM. Cell viability was measured using the 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay (0.5mg/ml, 2.5 hr) with formazan solubilized in 100% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and absorbance determined at 570 nm using a microplate reader
(Sunrise; TECAN); and by lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) assay using a Cytotoxicity Detection Kit
(Roche) according to the protocol recommended by the
manufacturer. Total LDH release was obtained by
treating control cells with 2% Triton X-100 (Sigma).
Absorbance at 490 nm was determined after 30-min
incubation. Percentage of LDH release was measured as
[(experimental value  vehicle control)/ (total release 
vehicle control)]  100%.

H2S Synthesizing Activity Assay
H2S synthesizing activity in cells was measured according
to Qu et al. (2006). Brieﬂy, cells were homogenized in
0.1 mol/L potassium phosphate buﬀer, pH 7.4 (0.45 ml)
containing varying concentrations of Cys and Hcy
(total volume 0.5 ml). Blank was done by omitting the
substrates. After incubation for 90 min at 37  C, zinc acetate (1%, 0.25 ml) was added into the reaction mixture
followed by tricholoracetic acid (10%, 0.25 ml). After
centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 10 min) at 4  C, N-dimethylp-phenylenediamine sulfate (20 mmol/L prepared in 7.2
mol/L HCl, 0.133 mL) and FeCl3 (30 mmol/L prepared
in 1.2 mol/L HCl, 0.133 mL) were added to the supernatant. Absorbance at 670 nm was measured using a
microplate reader (Sunrise; TECAN) 20 min later.
Absorbance was converted to H2S concentration through
a standard curve obtained by using NaHS as the
standard.

pMCAO Model
pMCAO was performed according to Tamura et al.
(1981). Animals were housed under diurnal lighting conditions and fed standard rat chow and water ad libitum.
Cerebral ischemia was induced by permanent occlusion
of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) using a subtemporal approach. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (6 to 8 weeks
old) were anesthetized with ketamine (75 mg/kg, intraperitoneally; Parnell Laboratories Pty Ltd, Alexandria,
NSW, Australia) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally; Troy Laboratories Pty Ltd, Smithﬁeld, NSW,
Australia). The MCA was exposed through a subtemporal craniectomy and cauterized from the point proximal to its origin to the points where it intersects the
inferior cerebral vein. During the procedure, rat body
temperature was maintained at 37  C until recovery
from anesthesia. For infarct volume assessments, rats
were decapitated at 8 or 24 hr after the pMCAO procedure as described above. Whole brains were cut into 2 mm
coronal sections and immediately stained with 2% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma Chemical
Co.). Infarct volumes in the cortex, striatum, and whole
hemisphere were measured using the Scion imaging software (Frederick, MD, USA), and correction for brain
edema was performed using the contralateral hemisphere
as control. Infarct volumes are presented as the percentage of the total volume of the brain region/hemisphere.

Western Blot
Brains tissues from sham-operated control and pMCAO
(3 to72 hr) rats were lysed by RIPA buﬀer (Cell Signaling)
supplemented with protease inhibitor and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).

SH-SY5Y cells and primary cortical astrocytes were lysed
by CST buﬀer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche,
Manheim, Germany). Total protein was determined by
Bradford protein assay (Biorad, CA, USA). Proteins were
separated by 10% SDS/PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane (Amersham
Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), and then blocked
with 10% nonfat milk. The membrane was then incubated with antibodies against CBS, or b-actin (Cell
Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA, USA) at 4  C overnight, then washed and incubated in HRP-conjugated
anti-rabbit or mouse IgG at room temperature for 1 hr.
Visualization was carried out using Luminata Forte or
Crescendo
western
HRP
substrate
(Millipore
Corporation, Billercia, MA, USA), and the chemiluminescence signals were detected using UVIchemi (UVItec,
Cambridge, UK).

Immunofluorescence for Brain Slices
Rats were anaesthetized and perfused with 0.1 mol/L
phosphate buﬀer saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde through the heart. Brains were removed and
immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4  C.
Paraformaldehyde-ﬁxed brains were then cryoprotected
in 10% sucrose and eventually 20% sucrose at 4  C
until use. Coronal sections (30 lm) were made using a
cryostat and mounted on glass slides (Matsunami,
Japan). Nonspeciﬁc binding was blocked by incubating
the section in 5% goat serum for 1 hr at room temperature. Antibodies against CBS (1:200) was used and incubated at 4  C overnight. Sections were then rinsed and
incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
(Molecular probes, USA) secondary antibody for 1 hr
at room temperature. Fluorescent-labeled sections were
mounted using ProLong gold antifade reagent (Life technologies, USA). Negative control was performed by
probing sections with PBS with 0.1% Triton-X overnight.
All the ﬂuorescent images were captured using an
Olympus FluoView FV1000 (Olympus, Japan) laser scanning confocal microscope, and images captured was processed by FV10-ASW1.7.

Immunocytochemistry for Primary Cortical
Astrocytes
Primary astrocyte culture on poly-L-lysine-coated glass
coverslips were rinsed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, and ﬁxed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Fixed cells were
made permeable by incubating in PBS containing 0.1%
Triton-X for 10 min. Cells were blocked with 10% goat
serum for 1 hr at room temperature and then incubated
with primary monoclonal anti-GFAP (1:400; Sigma
Aldrich, USA) antibody and anti-CBS (1: 200) antibody

at 4  C overnight. After washing with PSB, cells were
incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
(Molecular probes, USA) or Alexa 555 (Molecular
probes, USA) for 1 hr at room temperature, and coverslip
was mounted using ProLong gold antifade reagent (Life
technologies, USA). Fluorescent images were captured
using QImaging (Canada), and images captured were
processed by Image Pro insight (QImaging, Canada).

Statistical Analysis
All comparisons were performed by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc analysis with
Bonferroni correction or by two-tailed independent t test
using IBM SPSS Statistics 19. Data are expressed as
meanSEM. Statistical signiﬁcance is reached when
p < .05.

Results
CBS Overexpression in SH-SY5Y Cells
Under normal conditions, SH-SY5Y cells express CBS at
a very low level. However, they can be eﬃciently transduced with lentiviral vector to overexpress CBS together
with EGFP, a ﬂuorescent reporter. Results shown in
Figure 1 conﬁrmed that these transduced cells strongly
express both EGFP and CBS (Figure 1(a) and 1(b)). The
full-length 63 kDa isoform was detected by Western blot
but not the truncated 45-kDa isoform (Figure 1(b)), indicating that the truncation mechanism may not be in place
in these cells. When CBS substrates (Cys þ Hcy) were
added to cell homogenates, H2S was produced in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1(c)). These results
indicate that the CBS artiﬁcially overexpressed in these
cells are fully functional. As 0.1 mM Cys þ 0.01 mM Hcy
are reportedly close to physiological concentrations
(Singh et al., 2009; Stipanuk and Ueki, 2011), these concentrations were used as the low substrate condition and
a 10-fold increase as the high substrate condition in subsequent experiments.

Effects of H2S Production on Cell Viability
CBS-overexpressing (CBSOE) cells did not show any
diﬀerence in cell viability on exposure to high or low
substrate concentrations when compared with control
cells as shown by the MTT assay (Figure 2(a)).
However, when cells are subjected to OGD, cell death
increased markedly regardless of substrate conditions.
In the absence or presence of low substrates, cell viability
fell to about 30% to 40 % in both cell types whether or
not CBS was overexpressed. In the presence of high substrates, cell viability was about 30% in the control cells
but about 5% in the CBSOE cells, indicating a signiﬁcant

increase in cell death. When LDH release was measured
under the same conditions, the results were entirely consistent with the MTT assay results (Figure 2(b)).
The enhanced cell death observed in CBSOE cells
when exposed to high substrate condition was attenuated
concentration in a concentration-dependent manner by
the addition of AOAA, a nonselective CBS inhibitor,
immediately after the addition of substrates
(Figures 2(c) and (d)). At 0.5 mM of AOAA, complete
reversal was achieved in the MTT assay, while only partial reversal was observed in LDH release assay. These
data strongly support the notion that elevated production
of H2S in cells subjected to high substrate conditions
enhanced cell death when the cells were subjected
to OGD.
We next examined the eﬀects of OGD in primary rat
astrocytes under diﬀerent substrate conditions.
Consistent with the ﬁndings in CBSOE SH-SY5Y cells,
primary astrocytes subjected to OGD under high concentrations of Cys þ Hcy showed cell viability of about 64%
by MTT assay, a signiﬁcant decrease from about 77% in
cells not exposed to substrates (Figure 3(a)). This is
supported by a threefold increase in LDH release
(Figure 3(b)). A small but signiﬁcant increase in LDH

release was also observed in control cells exposed to the
high substrate condition without OGD, as opposed to no
eﬀects observed by MTT assay. This may be due to toxicity attributable to Cys directly (Janaky et al., 2000) or
indirectly (Nath and Salahudeen, 1993). To see if these
eﬀects could be mediated by H2S, we added NaHS at
300 mM and observed a signiﬁcant decrease in cell viability in primary astrocytes when subjected to OGD
(Figures 3(c) and (d)).

Upregulation of CBS Expression and Infarct Volume
Following Ischemic Insults
CBS expression in primary astrocytes was found to
increase rapidly in rat brains within 30 min after the
onset of OGD and remained high for at least 3 hr
(Figure 4). However, unlike CBSOE SY-SH5Y cells,
Western blot results demonstrated the presence of both
the full-length and truncated isoforms (63 and 45 kDa,
respectively) of CBS.
The cortex and striatum are the most aﬀected regions
following pMCAO in rats (Liu et al., 2009). Western blot
analysis revealed that the truncated but not the fulllength CBS was markedly upregulated (about twofold)

Similarly, truncated CBS expression was upregulated
(sevenfold) in the striatum but at a later time point of
24 hr
post-pMCAO
(Figures

Immunoﬂuorescent staining (which does not distinguish
the full length from the truncated form) results were
consistent with the Western blot data, showing an upregulation of total CBS expression (Figures 5(c) and 6(c)).
CBS in both regions was largely expressed in astrocytes
based on colocalization with GFAP staining, while

colocalization of CBS and NeuN was not observed

following pMCAO in the cortex and striatum, the infarct
volumes in these two brain regions were determined at 8

than that at 8 hr (27% vs. 12%). In contrast, the infarct
volume in the cortex as well as the whole aﬀected hemisphere was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between the two

time points (Figure 7). This shows that the ischemic injuries continued to develop signiﬁcantly between 8 and
24 hr post-pMCAO in the striatum but not in the
cortex. Therefore, the peaking of CBS expression in the
striatum at 24 hr may appear to be associated with the
extent of ischemic injury.

Discussion
H2S can be produced in the body by three key enzymes,
namely CBS, CSE, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST, in combination with cysteine aminotransferase; Kashﬁ and Olson, 2013). CSE is expressed
predominantly in the cardiovascular system (Zhao
et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2013) but at low levels in the

brain and therefore generally accepted as a minor player,
if at all, in H2S production in the brain (Abe and Kimura,
1996). 3-MST is widely present in the brain, but its
physiological relevance is not clearly understood.
However, in a recent study, Zhao et al. (2013) reported
that 3-MST was downregulated in both the cortex and
striatum following pMCAO, hence mitigating its role in
increased production of H2S under ischemic conditions
(Zhao et al., 2013). Therefore, the focus is on CBS as the
predominant enzyme responsible for H2S production in
the brain.
The native CBS enzyme is a tetramer consisting of four
subunits of 63 kDa (551 amino acids). This subunit can
be cleaved in its C-terminal region at Arg413 to yield
a 45-kDa subunit that lacks the regulatory domain.

the increased expression of both the full length CBS (63 kDa) and truncated CBS (45 kDa) after OGD. (c) Densitometry measurement of
full length (63 kDa) CBS and truncated (45 kDa) CBS expression after OGD. Data are presented as mean  SEM, n ¼ 3. ANOVA for CBS

Two truncated subunits form a dimer that is about twice
as active as the tetramer (Kery et al., 1998; Majtan et al.,
2014). In primary astrocytes subjected to OGD, the
expression of the 63-kDa CBS was clearly upregulated
(Figure 4(b)), and the truncated form increased within
30 min. Similarly, the truncated form also increased in
both the cortex and striatum within 24 hr post-pMCAO
(Figures 5 and 6). These observations demonstrated that
CBS responds very rapidly to ischemic insults. In contrast
to primary astrocytes, the full-length 63-kDa CBS in the
cortex and striatum remained unchanged following
pMCAO as shown by Western blotting (Figures 5(a)
and 6(a)). This diﬀerence may be caused by the high
basal expression in the cortex and striatum as opposed
to very low basal level of CBS expression in the primary
astrocytes. However, the increased level of the 45-kDa
CBS implies an upregulation of the expression of the
63-kDa CBS. This is supported by the observed increase
in immunostaining for CBS (Figures 5(c) and 6(c)).
Therefore, it appears that increased CBS expression and

activation may underlie the increased production of H2S
in ischemia (Qu et al., 2006). The mechanism that triggers the activation by cleavage remains to be elucidated.
However, it has been reported that tumor necrosis factora (TNF-a) induced CBS cleavage in HepG2 cells (Zou
and Banerjee, 2003). This could be examined further as
inﬂammatory cytokines such as TNF-a were found to be
increased under ischemic conditions (Zhou et al., 2013).
It is possible that increased CBS truncation causes a corresponding increase in the expression of the full-length
enzyme by a positive feedback mechanism. It is noted
that the truncated form was not detected in the SHSY5Y CBSOE cells, indicating that cleavage of CBS
does not occur or occurs only at very low level
(Figure 1(b)) in cells that do not endogeneously express
CBS, perhaps due to the lack of the truncation mechanism. These cells can serve as a model to investigate the
factors that induce cleavage and thus activation of CBS.

elevated after stroke, and raised Hcy levels adversely
aﬀect cerebral infarction after stroke (Spence, 2007). In
animal studies, Cys has been reported to increase in
animal ischemic model, and Cys administration also
increases the ischemic damage after stroke (Slivka and
Cohen, 1993; Wong et al., 2006). Thus, there is ample
evidence to suggest that in acute stroke, CBS activation
is accompanied by a high availability of substrates for
H2S production, which is most eﬃciently produced by
b-replacement reaction where Cys condenses with Hcy
to produce H2S (Chen et al., 2004; Singh et al., 2009).
Taken together, it may be concluded that the acute ischemic conditions are conducive for markedly elevated production of H2S. We mimicked such conditions by
overexpressing CBS in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells

and observed a massive increase in H2S production
when the overexpressing cells were exposed to high substrate conditions but not substrate concentrations that
may reﬂect normal physiological conditions (Singh
et al., 2009; Stipanuk and Ueki, 2011). While Hcy and
Cys can be neurotoxic to cells at high concentrations
(Kruman et al., 2000; Poddar et al., 2001; Jara-Prado
et al., 2003; Wong et al., 2006; Hosoi et al., 2010; Koz
et al., 2010), the high concentrations used in these experiments were clearly nontoxic as no eﬀects on cell viability
were observed in both control or CBSOE cells. In addition, we had similarly overexpressed CBS in HEK293
cells, which are originated from the kidney. The same
results were obtained in these cells as in the CBSOE
SH-SY5Y cells (data not presented), indicating that the

presence of a high concentration of H2S would enhance
cell death under ischemic conditions in cells of neural or
nonneural origin.
The mechanism by which H2S enhances cell death
under ischemic conditions requires thorough investigations. It is known to inhibit cytochrome c oxidase, carbonic anhydrase, monoamine oxidase, cholinesterase,
and Naþ/Kþ-ATPase (Szabo, 2007); as well as to potentiate glutamate excitotoxicity (Cheung et al., 2007; Chen
et al., 2011). Using mature mouse cortical neurons
expressing functional glutamate receptors, Cheung
et al. (2007) reported that glutamate-induced cell death
was exacerbated by the addition of NaHS. They further
reported that NaHS at concentrations < 200 mM induced

apoptosis, while at concentrations > 200 mM, necrosis
was induced. In contrast, Kimura and Kimura (2004)
reported that H2S at 100 mM concentration reversed cell
death in immature mouse cortical neuron treated with
1 mM glutamate (Kimura and Kimura, 2004). These
ﬁndings suggest that H2S may have neuroprotective
eﬀects at lower range of concentrations but become cytotoxic at a higher range of concentrations (Dorman et al.,
2002). In our experiments, we did not observe any protective eﬀects under the low substrate conditions (Figures
2 and 3). This may be due to the low concentrations of
H2S that we used in our experiments or the selectivity of
H2S protective eﬀect for excitotoxic but not ischemic
insults.

In vivo, under ischemic conditions, excitotoxicity is
more important because the failure of the energy-dependent glutamate reuptake process leads to extracellular
accumulation of glutamate. However, such glutamate
accumulation is more unlikely in vitro, so excitotoxicity
is likely less important (Wang et al., 2002). OGD causes
energy depletion in cells, thus interrupting ATP-dependent processes notably the Naþ/Kþ-ATPase and eventually disruption of ion gradients across the cellular
membrane. This causes cell membrane depolarization
leading to Ca2þ overload (Wang et al., 2002) and cell
death by necrosis and apoptosis (Orrenius et al., 1994;
Kristian et al., 1998), involving the generation of free
radicals (Abramov et al., 2007), mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction (Kristian et al., 1998,) and
caspase activation (Chong et al., 2012). Interestingly, the
truncated CBS has also been reported to be able to generate superoxide radicals as it has reduction potential
similar to other hemethiolate proteins such as chloroperoxidase, cytochrome P450, and nitric oxide synthase
(Carballal et al., 2008). We are currently investigating
how H2S may interact with the cell death mechanisms
following OGD using the CBSOE cells.
H2S has also been reported to be cytoprotective
(Calvert et al., 2010) under various other conditions.
First, NaHS was reported to protect primary cortical
neurons (Kimura and Kimura, 2004), primary microglia
(Hu et al., 2007), and primary astrocytes (Lu et al.,
2008). In these studies, glutamate, lipopolysaccharide,
and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), respectively, were used
to induce cell injuries. In cultured cell lines, NaHS is
reportedly protective against cell damage induced
by Ab (Tang et al., 2008), rotenone (Hu et al., 2009),

6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; Tiong et al., 2010; Xie
et al., 2012), and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPPþ;
Yin et al., 2009). In the in vivo setting, protective eﬀects
has been reported against global cerebral ischemia (Ren
et al., 2010), and transient MCAO (Wang et al., 2014).
These may indicate diﬀerences between ischemic models
with and without reperfusion. Overall, it appears that the
eﬀects of H2S in ischemia may vary according to prevailing conditions, mechanism of the injury-inducing agent,
and concentrations of H2S. To our knowledge, no protective eﬀects have been reported against OGD in in vitro
studies. Much work is needed to provide further
understanding.
While it has been reported previously that administration of NaHS worsened stroke outcome in animal studies
(Qu et al., 2006), we have further provided strong evidence that endogenously produced H2S could enhance
cell death under ischemic conditions. Therefore, the present results may support the idea that CBS is a viable
therapeutic target, and CBS inhibition may hold promise
as a treatment of ischemic stroke. However, currently
available CBS inhibitors lack selectivity and are therefore
not suitable for in vivo investigations. More selective CBS
inhibitors will be needed for further progress.

Summary
Cystathionine b-synthase (CBS) is the predominant
enzyme responsible for the increased hydrogen sulﬁde
(H2S) production under ischemic conditions. High H2S
levels leads to enhanced cell death both in vitro and in
vivo. CBS may be a potential therapeutic target for the
treatment of stroke.
