Abstract We investigated the additive effect of repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) on functional outcome in the early subacute phase of stroke. Sevenweek-old male rats were subjected to permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and were divided into
four groups: normal saline administration with sham rTMS
(group 1, n = 15), G-CSF administration with sham rTMS
(group 2, n = 15), G-CSF with 1 Hz rTMS (group 3,
n = 14), and G-CSF with 20 Hz rTMS (group 4, n = 15).
Animals received G-CSF or saline for 5 days from the day
of MCAo and were concurrently treated with 20-min rTMS
on their lesioned hemisphere for 2 weeks. Neurological
functional score was worse in group 4 compared to that in

group 2 on day 15. In Western blots conducted on day 25,
phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was
markedly lower in groups 2, 3, and 4 than that in group 1 in
the ischemic border zone. PECAM-1 expression at ischemic
core was lower in groups 4 than in group 2. Caspase-3
expression was markedly higher in groups 4 than in group 1,
2, 3 at ischemic core. Iba1 expression was higher in groups
4 than in group 1, 2 at ischemic core. G-CSF combined with
rTMS administered in the early subacute phase of ischemic
stroke may exert a hazardous effect on functional recovery,
possibly due to impaired angiogenic mechanism, decreased
cell survival, and increased inflammation.

Growing evidence suggests that active angiogenesis occurs
around an infarct area after ischemic stroke. Facilitating the
molding of new vessels and collaterals has been highlighted
as an effective therapeutic strategy to alleviate ischemic
brain injury and make up for limitations of previous trials
aimed only at neuroprotection and neurogenesis. Animal
studies have revealed that interventions to enhance angiogenesis reduce infarct size and improve function. Krupinski
et al. [1] reported that angiogenesis increases significantly
in affected brain tissue compared to that of the contralesional hemisphere in patients who died due to stroke and
first described this angiogenic change with a positive correlation to survival period. Subsequently, angiogenesis was
shown to occur in the peri-infarct area 48–72 h post-stroke
and was maintained for 30 days [2, 3].

Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) enhances proliferation of leukocyte and has been safely used to
treat patients with neutropenia. This cytokine and its
receptors are widely expressed in the human central nervous system (CNS), and G-CSF is an endogenous protective mechanism in the CNS. The physiological effects of
G-CSF are anti-apoptosis [4], anti-inflammation, neurogenesis, enhancement of cellular growth, anti-oxidation,
recruitment of bone marrow stem cell to the CNS [5], and
arteriogenesis [6]. A meta-analysis about G-CSF in animal
models of focal cerebral ischemia reported that G-CSF
reduces infarct volume and facilitates functional recovery
after stroke [7]. Based on these results, clinical trials with
G-CSF have been conducted in patients with stroke [8, 9].
However, G-CSF has frequent side effects such as bone
pain, headache, splenomegaly, and the emergence of bone
marrow disease. Therefore, a treatment protocol with other
novel therapies that can enhance the effect of G-CSF sitespecifically is needed to minimize systemic adverse effects
and to administer G-CSF more safely.
In this aspect, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
is a promising adjunctive tool. Holding the coil changing
magnetic field rapidly at the skull makes an electric field
effective on the cerebral cortex, and activates neurons.
[10]. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)
can modulate excitability of the cerebral cortex, and this
effect is maintained after the stimulation is terminated.
rTMS is being actively studied worldwide as non-invasive
brain stimulation, and a very small portion of patients feel
discomfort after rTMS. Due to these advantages, rTMS has
been gaining clinical indications. In human, high frequency
rTMS on the ipsilesional hemisphere and low frequency on
contralesional hemisphere has been used to enhance cortical excitability of the affected hemisphere. The underpinning mechanism for contralateral stimulation is
assumed to be primarily via the transcallosal inhibition
between homologous isocortices of the bilateral hemispheres. However, there is a paucity of animal studies that
used rTMS stimulation protocols similar to those for
human research, because applying unilateral stimulation to
the small animal brain is technically challenging. For
example, even the smallest (25 mm) commercially available coil is too large to stimulate the rat brain as focal as in
rTMS study to the human brain. Interestingly, rTMS was
known to provoke vascular response as well as neural
activation. A study applying 4 Hz rTMS to the visual
cortex of cats observed coupled electrophysiological and
metabolic responses [11]. In this regard, rTMS after insult
to the brain is likely to affect the recovery process such as
neurogenesis and angiogenesis.
Thus, we investigated whether there is an additive effect
of rTMS combined with G-CSF on the functional outcome
in the early subacute phase of stroke. We evaluated the

potential use of rTMS for effective clinical application of
G-CSF.

Materials and methods
Experimental animals
Fifty-nine male 7-week-old Sprague–Dawley rats weighing
320 ± 27 g were subjected to permanent middle cerebral
artery (MCA) occlusion under inhalation anesthesia, which
was modified from the reversible occlusion model [12].
rTMS was delivered under intravenous anesthesia, using
propofol to minimize the cortical inhibitory effect of
inhalation anesthetics.
Experimental design
The 59 rats were divided into four groups: normal saline
administration with sham rTMS (group 1, n = 15), G-CSF
administration with sham rTMS (group 2, n = 15), G-CSF
with 1 Hz rTMS (group 3, n = 14), and G-CSF with 20 Hz
rTMS (group 4, n = 15). All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee.
G-CSF injection
Treatment consisted of G-CSF or normal saline for five
consecutive days. G-CSF (Jeil-Kirin GrasinÒ, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Korea Co., Ltd. Seoul, Republic of Korea) was
administrated intraperitoneally at 50 lg/kg/day beginning
immediately after MCA occlusion.
rTMS
A magnetic stimulator (Magstim RapidÒ, Magstim Co.
Ltd, Wales, UK) was used, and biphasic stimuli were
delivered by a 25 mm figure-of-8 coil (9925-00, Magstim
Co). rTMS was targeted on the unilateral cerebral hemisphere (Fig. 1). Stimulation intensity was set at 100 % of
motor threshold. Sham rTMS was performed with perpendicular positioning of the coil to the rat brain. A 20 min
rTMS was conducted on the lesioned hemisphere for
2 weeks (10 sessions), concurrently with G-CSF or normal
saline treatment.
Neurological functional tests
All animals were evaluated using the neurological functional score developed by Garcia [13], the modified foot
fault test, and the rotarod performance test on days 1, 7, 15,
and 25. Garcia’s score consists of six items. Allocated

scores range from 3 to 18, and a higher score indicates
better motor performance. In the modified foot fault test, a
rat was placed on a grid and encouraged to traverse the grid
surface for 1 min. When the rat traversed the grid, occasional errors in limb placement were counted. These mistakes were considered foot faults, and the number of error
per meter was analyzed. The rotarod performance test was
performed, using a 9-cm diameter rod. After a 2-min
adaptation at 2 rpm, rotational speed was increased gradually by 1 rpm every minute. The rotational speed was
recorded when the rat fell off the rod or just hung without
walking.
Western blot analysis
Western blots were conducted (n = 6 in each group) after
brain tissue was harvested from the ischemic core, the
ischemic border zone, and the contralesional homologous
cortex on day 25. Antibodies to endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS), its phosphorylated form (phospho-eNOS)
and PECAM-1(CD31) were applied to evaluate the degree
of angiogenesis, while that to Akt, its phosphorylated form
(phospho-Akt) and caspase-3 to observe cell survival and
apoptosis [14–16]. Antibody to Iba1, microglial marker, was
treated to evaluate intracerebral inflammation [17].
Statistics
Statistical analyses were carried out with SPSS software
for Windows ver. 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
was used to compare differences on the neurological
functional tests, baseline data being used as covariate. The
Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare differences in
Western blot between the four groups. Differences were
considered significant at a p value \ 0.05.

Results
High frequency rTMS exerted a deleterious effect
on neurological functional score
The neurological functional score developed by Garcia was
poor in group 4 compared to that in group 2 on day 15
(p = 0.043, repeated-measures ANCOVA, and p = 0.033,
by post hoc test) and showed no difference between the
groups on days 7 and 25. The results of the modified foot
fault and rotarod performance tests were comparable
between the four groups (p = 0.285 and 0.377, respectively) (Fig. 2).
Expression and phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS
decreased after administering G-CSF with rTMS
On day 25, Akt expression in the ischemic core was lower
in group 4 than that in group 2 (p = 0.003, Kruskal–Wallis
test). Akt phosphorylation was lower in the ischemic core
of group 4 than that in group 2 (p = 0.047), whereas it was
lower in groups 2, 3, and 4 than that in group 1 in the

divided by Akt (pAkt/Akt) also tended to be lower in
groups 2, 3, and 4 than that in group 1 in the ischemic

eNOS expression in the ischemic core was lower in

phosphorylation of eNOS in the ischemic core was lower in
group 4 than that in groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.015), whereas it
was lower in groups 3 and 4 than that in group 1 in the
ischemic border zone (p = 0.010). Importantly, phosphorylation of eNOS divided by eNOS (p-eNOS/eNOS)
was markedly lower in groups 2, 3, and 4 than that in group
1 in the ischemic border zone (p = 0.007). (Figure 3).
Expression of PECAM-1 decreased,
and that of caspase-3 and Iba1 increased

On day 25, PECAM-1 expression at ischemic core was
lower in groups 4 than in group 2 (p = 0.040, Kruskal–
Wallis test). Notably, expression of caspase-3 was markedly higher in groups 4 than in group 1, 2, 3 at ischemic
core (p = 0.002), whereas it was higher in groups 2 than in
group 1, 3, 4 in the ischemic border zone (p = 0.002). Iba1
expression was remarkably higher in groups 4 than in
group 1, 2 at ischemic core (p = 0.004) (Fig. 4).

Discussion
rTMS has an effect of intracortical inhibition at low frequency and intracortical facilitation at high frequency,
which is activity-dependent plasticity. rTMS increases
excitability of a lesioned primary motor cortex [18], and
improves response velocity, as well as task performance in
patients with acute stroke [19]. Although the effects of
rTMS on angiogenesis are not well-studied, there are several
suggested mechanisms of how rTMS facilitates angiogenesis. First, exercise or physical activity enhances angiogenesis through the eNOS pathway [20]. As rTMS can

123

emulate activity-dependent neuroplasticity as mentioned
previously, neuroplastic mechanisms that physical activity
elicits can be mimicked by applying rTMS to the motor
cortex. Second, electrical stimulation facilitates angiogenesis in peripheral tissues [21]. rTMS also generates an
electric field in tissues. Third, rTMS elicits neurovascular
coupling. Cerebral blood flow is controlled with the degree
of neural activity temporally and spatially, which is called
neurovascular coupling. Neuronal activity induces subsequent physiological hyperemia [22] mediated by astrocytes producing potent vasoactive substances, such as nitric
oxide, K?, adenosine, and arachidonic acid metabolites
[23]. rTMS can induce physiologically vasoactive substances to be secreted continuously, which is a precipitating
factor in angiogenesis. Also, rTMS has been applied to
stroke patients in acute, subacute and chronic phase [24–28].
We used both low- and high-frequency rTMS because
low-frequency rTMS enhanced angiogenesis paradoxically
in our previous unpublished study on rats, which is quite
unlike the well-established frequency-dependent effect of
rTMS in human subjects. Thus, we assumed that either low
or high frequency facilitates angiogenic effect of G-CSF,
whereas other frequency possibly reverses it. In other
words, we expected frequency-specific synergistic effect.
For this reason, we conducted experiments with stimulation
protocol different from the usual one for human study.
However, in the present study, concurrent use of high
frequency rTMS with G-CSF had a deleterious effect on
functional recovery, compared to that of G-CSF alone. The
ratio of phospho-eNOS to their naı̈ve form (eNOS) was
lower in the G-CSF and rTMS-treated groups (groups 2, 3,
and 4) compared to those in the control group (group 1).
Moreover, the expression of PECAM-1 at ischemic core was
lower in groups 4 than in group 2, whereas that of Caspase-3
and Iba1 was higher in groups 4 than in group 1 and 2.
These results were different from several studies suggesting a possible beneficial effect of G-CSF on stroke
recovery. But, an overall negative effect on neural function
and neurogenesis following G-CSF treatment was also
reported during the post-stroke period [29]. G-CSF

significant benefit in terms of infarct volume and clinical
outcome [30]. Impaired functional recovery in group 4 (GCSF with 20 Hz rTMS) was also shown in our study.
A possible mechanism for this phenomenon is that
G-CSF enhances an inflammatory response after stroke
[17, 29]. Stroke generally disturbs the integrity of the
blood–brain barrier, which permits input of inflammatory
cells into brain tissue. Furthermore, G-CSF-induced augmentation of the inflammatory response can result in further brain damage. By these reason, impaired functional
recovery may have been due to increased inflammation
caused by G-CSF, and aggravated by rTMS, which
necessitates further investigation.

123

Although the use of G-CSF in stroke patients failed to
show significant benefit in Cochrane Database Systematic
Review [31], animal studies using G-CSF still provide
valuable insights on mechanism of stroke recovery and
related potential therapeutics. We believe that investigation
of angiogenesis, the important recovery mechanism after
stroke, and its enhancement by external agent such as
G-CSF is still a viable research theme worth exploring.
There are a few limitations in this study. First, the
sample size was small to assess the effect of rTMS and
G-CSF with high statistical power. Second, we could not
quantify histologic findings such as immunofluorescence
analysis. We harvested tissue, however, from three different sites of the brain (ischemic core, ischemic border zone,
and contralesional homologous cortex) for western blots,
which could give evidence, though it was not strong, for
regional differences.
In conclusion, rTMS combined with G-CSF administered in the early subacute phase of ischemic stroke failed
to enhance functional recovery. Caution should be taken
when using of G-CSF or rTMS in patients in acute or early
subacute stage stroke. Instead, G-CSF or rTMS can be
considered during the chronic phase of stroke when the
inflammatory response has sufficiently subsided. Further
studies exploring the possible mechanisms with histologic
analysis and with a longer time window are needed to
increase understanding about the therapeutic mechanism of
rTMS at the molecular level.
