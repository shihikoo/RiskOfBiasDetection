a b s t r a c t
Several recent studies have demonstrated that TAT and other arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) have
intrinsic neuroprotective properties in their own right. Examples, we have demonstrated that in addition to TAT,
poly-arginine peptides (R8 to R18; containing 8–18 arginine residues) as well as some other arginine-rich peptides are neuroprotective in vitro (in neurons exposed to glutamic acid excitotoxicity and oxygen glucose deprivation) and in the case of R9 in vivo (after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat). Based on
several lines of evidence, we propose that this neuroprotection is related to the peptide's endocytosis-inducing
properties, with peptide charge and arginine residues being critical factors. Speciﬁcally, we propose that during
peptide endocytosis neuronal cell surface structures such as ion channels and transporters are internalised,
thereby reducing calcium inﬂux associated with excitotoxicity and other receptor-mediated neurodamaging signalling pathways. We also hypothesise that a peptide cargo can act synergistically with TAT and other argininerich CPPs due to potentiation of the CPPs endocytic traits rather than by the cargo-peptide acting directly on its
supposedly intended intracellular target. In this review, we systematically consider a number of studies that have
used CPPs to deliver neuroprotective peptides to the central nervous system (CNS) following stroke and other
neurological disorders. Consequently, we critically review evidence that supports our hypothesis that neuroprotection is mediated by carrier peptide endocytosis. In conclusion, we believe that there are strong grounds to
regard arginine-rich peptides as a new class of neuroprotective molecules for the treatment of a range of neurological disorders.

1. Introduction
1.1. Neuroprotective peptides and cell penetrating peptides
In recent years there has been an increased interest in the use of speciﬁcally designed peptides targeting cyto-damaging or cyto-protective
pathways as neuroprotective agents. There are several reasons why
this interest arose, including: i) peptide sequences critical for neurodamaging or neuroprotective intracellular protein–protein interactions
can be easily identiﬁed and used as competitive inhibitors of target proteins (e.g. JNKI-1 peptide); ii) small peptides (2–40 amino acids) can be
synthesised relatively cheaply using commercial sources; and iii) the
development of cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), also referred to as protein or peptide transduction domains (PTDs), has provided a way to deliver peptides and other cargos (incl. proteins, nucleic acids and drugs)
into cells and across the blood–brain barrier.
The discovery of CPPs has led to studies on the ability of a number of
peptides and proteins to act as neuroprotection agents, as well as providing a means to explore the role of protein/protein interactions
in brain function in health and disease (viz. neurological and nonneurological disorders). The main focus of this review is the use of
arginine-rich CPPs (mainly TAT) for the delivery of neuroprotective
peptides (b40 amino acids) particularly in cerebral ischaemia and
stroke. The recent observation that CPPs have intrinsic neuroprotective
properties in their own right has led us to question the conclusions of
other studies. Here, we critically reappraise previous studies that have
used putative neuroprotective peptides fused to CPPs as agents in cerebral ischaemia and other models of CNS injury, and examine the mechanism whereby arginine rich-peptides exert their neuroprotective
effects. Importantly, we highlight that many past studies on neuroprotective peptides that have used cationic CPPs for CNS delivery may
need to be reinterpreted in the light of the intrinsic neuroprotective
effects of the carrier-peptide.
1.2. Cell penetrating peptides
Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are small peptides (typically 5–25
amino acids) that are commonly used to facilitate the delivery of normally non-permeable cargo molecules such as other peptides, proteins,

nucleic acids or drugs into cells, and across the blood–brain barrier. The
development of CPPs as drug vehicles was sparked by the discovery
of the PTD within the human immunodeﬁciency virus-type 1 transactivator of transcription (HIV-TAT) protein (Frankel & Pabo, 1988;
Green & Loewenstein, 1988). The active transporting peptide sequence
within the HIV-TAT protein was isolated (TAT48–57: GRKKRRQRRR) and
is now referred to as the TAT peptide or TAT (Becker-Hapak et al., 2001).
Subsequently, over 100 CPPs have been identiﬁed (Milletti, 2012).
By far the most commonly used CPP peptide is TAT, especially to deliver various cargo molecules to the brain, including neuroprotective
peptides and proteins. Other CPPs include penetratin (also known as
antennapedia), poly-arginine peptides (R8 to R12; where R refers to
arginine residues), Pep-1 and transportan. The amino acid sequences
for these peptides, as well as of some less commonly used CPPs,
are shown in Table 1. TAT, poly-arginine and penetratin are cationic
arginine-rich CPPs.
1.3. Arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides and intrinsic neuroprotection
Potential neuroprotective peptides fused to CPPs have been assessed
in cultured neurons and animal models that mimic neural injury mechanisms seen in a variety of disorders, including cerebral ischaemia, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and
Alzheimer's disease (Arthur et al., 2007; Colombo et al., 2007; Lai et al.,
2005; Liu et al., 2006; Meade et al., 2009; Nagel et al., 2008). However,
several years ago, we and others demonstrated that TAT possesses intrinsic neuroprotective properties both in vitro in neurons exposed
to excitotoxicity and oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) and in vivo
following cerebral ischaemia in P12 rats after intraventricular injection
(Craig et al., 2011; Meade et al., 2010a, b; Vaslin et al., 2009b; Xu
et al., 2008). We subsequently showed that poly-arginine-9 (R9),
penetratin and Pep-1 also display neuroprotective actions in in vitro
excitotoxic and/or OGD models (Meloni et al., 2014). Furthermore, our
data showed that R9 and penetratin were 17- and 4.6-fold respectively
more neuroprotective than TAT (Meloni et al., 2014).
The higher potency of R9 relative to TAT and penetratin led us to
explore the in vitro neuroprotective potency of other poly-arginine peptides (R1, R3, R6–R15 and R18), as well as, other arginine-rich peptides
(Meloni et al., 2015). These studies conﬁrmed that poly-arginine and

arginine-rich peptides as a group are highly neuroprotective, with efﬁcacy increasing with increasing arginine content, peaking at R15
(Meloni et al., 2015). We also showed that arginine-rich peptides have
the capacity to reduce glutamic acid-induced neuronal calcium inﬂux
and are neuroprotective with a single treatment several hours before
glutamic acid or OGD exposure. Furthermore, neuroprotective efﬁcacy
was shown to be directly related to peptide positive net charge conferred by the positively charged arginine (R) and lysine (K) amino
acids residues, which could be blocked by fusion with a negatively
charged glutamic acid (E9) poly-peptide (e.g. R9/E9 peptide) or by incubation with the highly negatively charged molecule heparin. The latter
ﬁnding strongly suggests that peptides bind to negatively charged cell
surface molecules such as heparin sulphate proteoglycans (HSPGs),
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) or sialic acid residues present
in glycosphingolipids to initiate and stimulate peptide endocytosis
(Favretto et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2012; Ravindran et al., 2013;
Wallbrecher et al., 2014) a process crucial for neuroprotection (Meloni
et al., 2015). In this context, others have demonstrated that the nature
of the peptide interaction with HSPGs determines CPPs endocytic properties (Wallbrecher et al., 2014).
With respect to endocytosis, studies have demonstrated that peptide
charge conferred by arginine and lysine residues (note: arginine and lysine are the only two strongly positively charged amino acids, with histidine being only weakly positively charged, whereas glutamic acid and
aspartic acid are the only two negatively charged amino acids) facilitate
HSPG binding, and that mainly arginine residues trigger the endocytic
process (Amand et al., 2012; Wallbrecher et al., 2014; Yang et al.,
2014). Consistent with our proposed endocytic neuroprotective mechanism, we have demonstrated that poly-lysine (K10) is only weakly neuroprotective in a cortical neuronal glutamic acid excitotoxicity model
(Meloni et al., 2015). It is also likely that other amino acids can inﬂuence
the endocytic properties of cationic peptides in both a positive and negative manner as has been demonstrated for tryptophan (W; Rydberg
et al., 2012; Bechara et al., 2013) and alanine (A; Yang et al., 2014), respectively. Indeed, we have now conﬁrmed that tryptophan and alanine
amino acids within arginine-rich peptides respectively increase and decrease neuroprotective efﬁcacy in a glutamic acid excitotoxicity model
(Fig. 1).
1.4. Proposed neuroprotective
mechanism of action used by arginine-rich peptides
Based on our recent ﬁndings we hypothesised that arginine-rich
peptides exert their neuroprotection effects by inducing the endocytic
internalisation of cell surface ion channels, thereby reducing the

damaging effects of excitotoxicity (see Fig. 2). This is a novel hypothesis
that essentially identiﬁes arginine-rich peptides as a new class of neuroprotective molecule. There are several lines of evidence based on our
ﬁndings and those of others that support our endocytosis hypothesis.
Arginine-rich peptides, including so called “neuroprotective peptides”
fused to TAT have been shown to: i) reduce neuronal calcium inﬂux
(Meloni et al., 2015) and interfere with ion channel function (NMDA receptor: Ferrer-Montiel et al., 1988; Tu et al., 2010; Sinai et al., 2010;
Brittain et al., 2011b; Brustovetsky et al., 2014, VR1: Planells-Cases
et al., 2000, CaV2.2: Brittain et al., 2011a, 2011b; Feldman & Khanna,
2013; Brustovetsky et al., 2014; sodium calcium exchanger [NCX],
CaV3.3: García-Caballero et al., 2014); ii) cause internalisation of neuronal ion channels (Brustovetsky et al., 2014; Sinai et al., 2010); and iii)
require endocytosis as a prerequisite for neuroprotection (Meloni
et al., 2015; Vaslin et al., 2011). Interestingly, other TAT-fused peptides
have also been shown to interfere with the function of neuronal receptors (D1R–D2R; Pei et al., 2010; PTPσ: Lang et al., 2015). In this context,
it is important to note that endocytosis is a known mechanism used
by cells to internalise cell surface receptors (Höller & Dikic, 2004;
Marchese, 2014; Maxﬁeld & McGraw, 2004).
Neuroprotective efﬁcacy, at least for poly-arginine peptides (Meloni
et al., 2015), appears to correlate with peptide transduction efﬁcacy
(Mitchell et al., 2000), a process known to occur by endocytosis
(Appelbaum et al., 2012; Bechara et al., 2013; El-Sayed et al., 2009).
Furthermore, it is important to note that the rapid and transient
(lasting up to 4 h with peptide pre-treatment) nature of the neuroprotection induced by poly-arginine peptides (Meloni et al., 2015)
corresponds closely to the timeframes of endocytosis and endosomal
receptor re-cycling (Gundelﬁnger et al., 2003; Maxﬁeld & McGraw,
2004; Yashunsky et al., 2009). Importantly, it is known that TAT,
penetratin and R9 can induce the internalisation of EGFR and TNFR
in HeLa cells (Fotin-Mleczek et al., 2005). Our hypothesis also links
endocytosis as a common neuroprotective mechanism of action for
a diverse range of arginine-rich peptides (including TAT-fused peptides), all of which are likely to have endocytic inducing properties.
This neuroprotective mechanism that we propose is also consistent
with the link between neuronal cell surface-HSPGs (Litwack et al.,
1994) and endocytic activity (Vaslin et al., 2009a), which are known
to promote endosomal uptake of cationic CPPs (Nakase et al., 2007;
Vaslin et al., 2009a, 2011). It is also possible that other negatively
charged cell surface receptors such as CSPGs and glycosphingolipids
can promote cationic CPP endocytosis and neuroprotection. As mentioned above, positively charged poly-arginine and arginine-rich
peptides are known to bind negatively charged HSPGs to initiate endocytosis. It is important to note that any neuroprotective peptide fused to

a CPP and internalised by endocytosis must escape the endosome to interact with its intended cytoplasmic target. However, endosomal escape
appears to be a highly inefﬁcient process (Appelbaum et al., 2012; Qian
et al., 2014) (and rarely conﬁrmed) and as a result, due to the cargo's
inability to engage with its intracellular target it is unlikely to have a
signiﬁcant impact within the cytoplasm.
In light of our recent ﬁndings, the aim of this review is to critically
re-examine studies in the literature that have used neuroprotective
peptides fused to cationic CPPs (i.e. TAT, R9) and present evidence
supporting our hypothesis that the neuroprotective actions of these
peptides are primarily, if not exclusively, due to the endocytic properties of the peptide per se.

2. Examination of studies using CPP-fused
to neuroprotective peptides in neuronal injury models
To date, over a dozen of neuroprotective peptides fused to CPPs have
been described (Tables 2–4). Three of the most intensely studied peptides developed as potential neuroprotective agents for stroke/cerebral
ischaemia are NR2B9c, JNKI-1 and CBD3 (Tables 2–4). This review in
particular critically examines the use of these three peptides in a
neurological setting, and provides evidence suggesting that the critical neuroprotective and functional structural elements of these peptides are arginine and lysine residues in the carrier and cargo-peptides.
The remainder of the review focuses on a range of other peptides to further highlight possible biological effects mediated by the TAT carrier
peptide.

2.1. NR2B9c and Tat-NR2B9cpeptide (also known as NA-1)
NR2B9c is a 9 amino acid peptide (KLSSIESDV1479–1484) derived from
the intracellular terminal carboxyl region of the N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor NR2B subunit protein (Aarts et al., 2002). This region
of the NR2B subunit was selected for peptide design because of its high
binding afﬁnity to the cytoplasmic signalling/adaptor protein postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) via one of its three PDZ domains (PDZ:
PSD-95, and Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor, and zonula
occludens-1 protein: three proteins that share this signalling domain).
PSD-95 couples the NR2B subunit to intracellular signalling proteins
and enzymes, subsequent to NMDA receptor activation. For example,
following receptor activation by the neurotransmitter glutamate, PSD95 binds to the NR2B subunit and the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), resulting in the production of nitric oxide (NO), which
under normal conditions serves as a signalling molecule in neuronal,
glia and vascular cells. As a consequence, the NR2B9c peptide has the
potential to act as a competitive inhibitor of PSD-95 binding to the
NR2B subunit, and in doing so blocks down-stream signalling associated
with the interaction of these two proteins.
In cerebral ischaemia, one neuro-damaging event linked to NMDA receptor over-activation and PSD-95 signalling is nNOS over-stimulation
and the excessive production of NO. In addition to the direct intracellular
toxic effects of NO, a major target for this free radical is stress-activated
protein kinase p38, which is known to be involved in ischaemic brain injury (Barone et al., 2001). The inhibition of NO over-production is thought
to be the basis of the neuroprotective action of the TAT fused NR2B9c
peptide (TAT-NR2B9c).

(Aarts et al., 2002). A concentration of 0.05 μM is considerably lower
than the concentration required to achieve neuroprotection for other
TAT-fused peptides and arginine-rich peptides (Meloni et al., 2014,
2015). It is therefore hardly surprising that when tested at 0.05 μM,
TAT-NR2B9c did not affect synaptic responses in brain slices or NMDA induced calcium inﬂux in cortical neurons. By contrast, it is surprising that
at 0.05 μM TAT-NR2B9c was effective in reducing cortical neuronal death
and cGMP levels (increases after nNOS activation) following NMDA exposure (20–100 μM) after either a 1-hour pre-exposure or continuous postinsult exposure. One possible explanation to account for the neuroprotective efﬁcacy of TAT-NR2B9c at 0.05 μM following NMDA exposure may
relate to the lower level of excitotoxicity induced by the model.
The model incorporates 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX)
and nimodipine in the culture medium during NMDA exposure to prevent secondary activation of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors and voltage-gated calcium channels,
respectively. In a subsequent study using a NMDA model in the presence
of the voltage-gated calcium channel blocker nifedipine, TAT-NR2B9c
at 2 μM was shown to be neuroprotective following exposure
to 20–60 μM NMDA, but not 100 μM (Soriano et al., 2008). Interestingly, although individually the TAT-NR2B9c (2 μM) nor JNKI-1TATD (2 μM) peptides were effective following 100 μM NMDA exposure, together they had a synergistic positive effect (Soriano et al.,
2008).
In their initial study of TAT-NR2B9c, Aarts et al. (2002) used a variety
of controls including: i) a mutated TAT-NR2B9c peptide (KLSSIEADA;
TAT-NR2B9c-AA) incapable of binding to PSD-95 (negative

control); ii) a TAT-fused truncated PSD-95 protein (pTAT-PDZ1-2)
containing PDZ domains 1 and 2 that is known to competitively
block PSD-95 binding to the NR2B subunit and: iii) a pTAT-GK protein containing the PSD-95 guanylate kinase-like domain that
does not interfere with PSD-95 binding to the NR2B subunit. At
0.05 μM, none of the controls blocked neuronal calcium inﬂux following NMDA exposure (in the presence of CNQX and nimodipine),
while only the pTAT-PDZ1-2 protein (like the TAT-NR2B9c peptide)
was neuroprotective following NMDA exposure. Unlike the TATNR2B9c peptide, the TAT-NR2B9c-AA peptide did not inhibit cGMP
formation.
In a recent study (Chen et al., 2015), TAT-NR2B9c was shown to
inhibit neuronal NMDA induced superoxide production by blocking
the activation of the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase) complex. It was
proposed that the TAT-NR2B9c peptide by inhibiting the PSD-95/
NR2B9c interaction blocked PSD-95 adaptor protein APPL1 (adaptor
protein, phosphotyrosine interaction, PH domain and leucine
zipper containing 1) coupling with PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-4,5bisphosphate 3-kinase), thereby inhibiting PKCζ (protein kinase
C) to phosphorylate the NADPH oxidase subunit protein p46 phox ,
which is required for activation of the complex. Interestingly, the
TAT-fused arginine-rich NADPH oxidase complex inhibitor peptide
gp91ds-TAT (CSTRIRRQL-TAT-NH2; net charge with NH2 group +12)
inhibited neuronal NMDA induced superoxide production to a greater
extent than TAT-NR2B9c, while the TAT-fused non arginine-rich scrambled peptide (CSFNSYELGSLCY-TAT) did not. The Chen et al. (2015)
study also showed that TAT-NR2B9c did not inhibit NMDA induced neuronal calcium inﬂux.
In our laboratory, we have shown that TAT-NR2B9c is not neuroprotective in cultured neurons exposed to glutamic acid induced
excitotoxicity, even at high concentrations (20 μM), while modest

neuroprotection is evident in a milder NMDA excitotoxicity model
(Meloni et al., 2015). In addition, we have also shown that at 5 μM,
TAT-NR2B9c can reduce neuronal calcium inﬂux following glutamic
acid exposure, but not to the same extent as a poly-arginine peptide
(Fig. 3 and Meloni et al., 2015).

2.1.2. In vivo studies
Studies utilising the TAT-NR2B9c peptide in different in vivo injury
models are presented in Table 2. Animal studies have generally yielded
positive outcomes with TAT-NR2B9c being shown to be neuroprotective at doses ranging from 30 to 3000 nmol/kg. Neuroprotection was
seen in the macaque when TAT-NR2B9c treatment was commenced
3 h after stroke onset, in a 3.5 hour transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. While some positive results have been obtained
in permanent MCAO models, several studies have reported a lack of
neuroprotection even at a dose of 3000 nmol/kg. In the few studies
that have investigated the TAT-NR2B9c-AA negative control, no neuroprotection was evident (See Table 2).

Of particular interest is a study in humans using TAT-NR2B9c
(renamed NA-1 in the study) following endovascular treatment to repair ruptured or unruptured intracranial aneurysms (ENACT: Evaluating Neuroprotection in Aneurysm Coiling Therapy) (Hill et al., 2012).
The ENACT trial conﬁrmed that TAT-NR2B9c is safe, and showed that
while two-thirds of the trial participants (peptide; n = 92/saline;
n = 93) had small ischaemic stroke lesions detectable by MRI, patients
treated with peptide had signiﬁcantly fewer brain infarcts.
2.1.3. Is the neuroprotective action of
TAT-NR2B9c mediated by TAT or the NR2B9c peptide?
Based on recent observations on the neuroprotective properties of
cationic CPPs, we view it as likely that TAT itself is the active neuroprotective component in TAT-NR2B9c. Like TAT alone, TAT-NR2B9c has
only modest neuroprotective efﬁcacy in vitro, which can easily be overcome by increasing the severity of excitotoxicity (Martel et al., 2009).
The fact that the level of neuroprotection is only modest for TATNR2B9c is hardly surprising as the NR2B9c peptide contains one positively charged (lysine; K) and two negatively charged amino acids

(glutamic acid; E and aspartic acid; D), resulting in a peptide net charge
(+7; hereafter net charge is at pH 7) lower than TAT (+8). Given the
importance of peptide charge in peptide neuroprotection (Meloni
et al., 2015), the NR2B9c peptide is unlikely to potentiate the neuroprotective properties of TAT by way of cationic charge. However, the
NR2B9c peptide is larger in size, which may contribute to peptide stability and thereby improve peptide efﬁcacy to a small degree. We believe
that TAT-NR2B9c has modest neuronal cell endocytic penetrating properties compared to poly-arginine peptides, (e.g. R12 and R15) and
therefore is likely to have a modest capacity to reduce the level of

surface receptors (e.g. NMDA and VGCC). This would explain why
TAT-NR2B9c has a lower capacity to inhibit glutamate induced calcium
inﬂux compared to poly-arginine peptides (Fig. 3 and Meloni et al.,
2015) and why neuroprotection provided by the peptide is easily overcome by increasing the severity of excitotoxicity (Martel et al., 2009;
Meloni et al., 2015; Soriano et al., 2008).
Given the above, it appears likely that the modest neuroprotective actions of TAT-NR2B9c simply reﬂect the modest level of neuroprotection
achievable with TAT. This may also explain why other NDMA receptor activated pathways not associated with NR2B/PSD-95 signalling, such as,

JNK and CREB are not inhibited by TAT-NR2B9c (Soriano et al., 2008).
Furthermore, the TAT-fused mutant peptide TAT-NR2B9c-AA is not
neuroprotective both in vitro and in vivo. The lack of neuroprotection of
TAT-NR2B9c-AA is consistent with a study demonstrating that alanine
can signiﬁcantly impede CPP-HSPG binding, a critical step in the process
of endocytosis (Yang et al., 2014).
While it cannot be precluded that one element in the neuroprotective
actions of TAT-NR2B9c is mediated by its inhibition of the PSD-95/NR29Bc
interaction within the cytoplasm, we view this as highly unlikely as this
would require the intact release of the peptide from endosomes following
cellular uptake. As discussed previously, CPP endosomal escape is known
to be a highly inefﬁcient process, and endosomal fusion to lysosomes
leads to the degradation of peptides and proteins (Maxﬁeld & McGraw,
2004). To this end, no evidence for the endosomal release of TATNR2B9c, or other CPP-fused neuroprotective peptides (TAT-JNKI-1, TATCBD3), has ever been directly demonstrated as is the case for all of the
cargo peptides fused to CPPs discussed in this review.
Another issue relevant to this discussion is that TAT-NR2B9c
mainly targets synaptically located NMDA receptors where there is an
abundant pool of PSD-95 protein. It is generally accepted that extrasynaptic NMDA receptor activation is cell death promoting, whereas
synaptic NMDA receptor activation is pro-survival (Hardingham &
Bading, 2010). There is the possibility that TAT-NR2B9c may act to
some degree by blocking synaptically induced neuronal NO production,
which could in theory have a negative impact on neuronal survival, as it
could lead to the inhibition of NO-induced blood vessel vasodilation
(Garthwaite, 2008; Lourenço et al., 2014), thereby potentially exacerbating the reduction in blood ﬂow seen in stroke.
It has been demonstrated that a TAT-NR2B9c peptide with a serine
(S) to theronine (T) substitution (KLSSIETDV; TAT-NR2B9cTDV) is as effective as TAT-NR2B9c as a neuroprotective agent following permanent
MCAO (Sun et al., 2008). The proposed mechanism of action of TATNR2B9c involves its speciﬁc binding to a peptide sequence within the
PSD-95 protein, thereby blocking NR2B/PSD-95 engagement (Aarts
et al., 2002). Given the high speciﬁcity of protein–protein interactions,
it is difﬁcult to reconcile this putative mechanism with the fact
that the TAT-NR2B9cTDV mutated peptide is capable of inhibiting the
NR2B/PSD-95 interaction, at least to the same level as the TAT-NR2B9c
peptide.
Recently, it was reported that TAT-NR2B9c reduces synaptically induced neuronal superoxide production (Chen et al., 2015) by disrupting
a signalling cascade initiated by NR2B/PSD-95 coupling and activation of
the NADPH oxidase membrane complex. However, it is more likely that
the TAT-NR2B9c peptide through its endocytosis-inducing properties
acts by reducing the levels of neuronal NMDA receptors and/or the
NADPH oxidase membrane complex, thereby also reducing superoxide
production.
2.2. JNKI-1 peptide and JNKI-TAT (also known as XG-102)
JNKI-1 is a 20 amino acid peptide (RPKRPTTLNLFPQVPRSQDT157–175)
derived from the signalling adaptor protein c-Jun N-terminal kinase
interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) (Borsello et al., 2003). The region of JIP-1
that provides the basis for JNKI-1 peptide design is the JNK binding domain. Consequently, the JNKI-1 peptide has the ability to competitively
inhibit JNK interaction with JIP-1, thereby block JNK activation (phosphorylation) and JNK downstream signalling (Borsello et al., 2003).
JNK is a protein kinase involved in the ﬁnal steps of a stress-activated
signalling pathway that leads to cell death. JNK is highly expressed in
neurons and is activated in the brain in pathological states associated
with excitotoxicity, including trauma, epilepsy and stroke (Borsello &
Bonny, 2004). Activated JNK can affect cell death pathways by altering
protein post-translational structure or by stimulating the expression of
pro-death proteins. The inhibition of JNK activation is thought to be
the mechanism by which the TAT-JNKI-1 peptide exerts its neuroprotective effects.

43

2.2.1. In vitro studies
The ﬁrst in vitro study (Borsello et al., 2003) explored the neuroprotective effects of TAT-JNKI-1 in both the L- and D-isoforms (i.e. peptide
synthesised with protease resistant D-amino acids, retro-inversely). In
cortical neuronal cultures exposed to NMDA excitotoxicity, peptides at
a concentration of 2 μM were highly neuroprotective after 12 h, but
only the D-isoform protected neurons for an extended period (24–
48 h). TAT-JNKI-1 treatment in the NMDA model also inhibited phosphorylation of the JNK target protein c-Jun. TAT and JNKI-1 as well as
a TAT fused mutant JNKI-1 peptide with three alanine substitutions
(RPKRPTAANAFPQVPRSQD-TAT) were not neuroprotective in cells exposed to NMDA excitotoxicity (Borsello et al., 2003).
A smaller version of JNKI-1 (RPKRPTTLNLF157–167) fused to TAT
(TAT-TIJIP) has also been assessed for neuroprotection in cultured
neurons exposed to glutamic acid excitotoxicity (Arthur et al., 2007).
At 2 μM TAT-TIJIP was highly neuroprotective at 24 h post-insult, even
in the presence of the mRNA transcription inhibitor actinomycin D.
This latter observation suggests that TAT-TIJIP neuroprotection does
not involve the inhibition of expression of pro-death proteins. In addition, TAT-TIJIP reduced neuronal cytosolic calcium levels following
glutamic acid exposure, suggesting that the mechanism of neuroprotection may involve improved mitochondrial function and calcium storage
capacity, rather than the direct blocking of intracellular inﬂux.
The in vitro neuroprotective ﬁndings reported for JNKI-1-TATD
are consistent with ﬁndings from our laboratory using this peptide in
neuronal excitotoxicity models (Craig et al., 2011; Meade et al., 2010a, b).
2.2.2. In vivo studies
Studies using the JNKI-1-TATD peptide in different in vivo animal
ischaemic injury models are presented in Table 3. As with the NR2B9c
peptide, most animal studies using JNKI-1-TATD have yielded positive
results. Studies in younger rats (P7–P12) have produced the best results
in terms of neuroprotective efﬁcacy and therapeutic time windows.
The effective dose ranges appears to be between 0.076 to 760 nmol/kg
via the IV route and 7.6 to 2800 nmol/kg when administered via the IP
route. Studies yielding negative results have usually been ones that
have used more severe models of ischaemic injury (permanent MCAO)
or pre- or late-treatment peptide administration time-points.
2.2.3. Is the neuroprotective action of
TAT-JNKI-1 mediated by TAT or the JNKI-1/TIJIP peptides?
We view it as most likely that the arginine and lysine residues in
the JNKI-1 and TIJIP peptides potentiate the neuroprotective actions of
TAT. The TAT-JNKI-1 and TAT-TIJIP peptides are highly cationic with a
net charge of +11. In addition, while it has been shown that the TATJNKI-1 peptide does not block NMDA induced calcium inﬂux (Centeno
et al., 2007), our laboratory has shown that this peptide is capable of reducing neuronal calcium inﬂux following glutamic acid exposure
(Meloni et al., 2015). Other studies have shown that the TAT-TIJIP peptide reduces neuronal intracellular calcium inﬂux following glutamic
acid exposure via a mechanism that is proposed to be associated with
an increased capacity of mitochondria to store incoming calcium
(Arthur et al., 2007). Given that the TAT fused JNKI-1/TIJIP peptides
have the ability to reduce neuronal excitotoxic intracellular calcium
levels, it is hardly surprising that associated down-stream pathological
processes, such as activation of calpain, JNK and c-Jun have consistently
been shown to be blocked by this peptide (Bessero et al., 2010; Borsello
et al., 2003; Meade et al., 2010a). It has never been explained, however,
how the TAT-JNKI-1 peptide has the capacity to block the activation of
the calcium-sensitive protease, calpain following an excitotoxic insult
(Meade et al., 2010a) if the peptide has no effect on neuronal calcium inﬂux (Centeno et al., 2007).
As discussed above, the presence alanine residues are known to impede CPP endocytosis. Consequently, the lack of neuroprotection seen
with a TAT fused mutant JNKI-1 peptide containing three alanine substitutions (RPKRPTAANAFPQVPRSQD-TAT) in cultured neurons exposed

44

B.P. Meloni et al. / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 153 (2015) 36–54

to NMDA excitotoxicity may well be due to the reduced endocytic traits
of this peptide. In this context, the studies by Vaslin et al. (2009a, 2011)
suggest that neuronal endocytic uptake of the TAT-JNKI-1 peptide is an
essential prerequisite for neuroprotection, a view reinforced by studies
in our laboratory (Meloni et al., 2015). However, as discussed elsewhere, our view is that the endocytic process is the key to the neuroprotective mechanism and that the interaction of the TAT-JNKI-1 peptide
with its cytoplasmic target (JIP scaffold protein) is unlikely to play a
major role due to poor endosomal peptide escape and/or endosomal/
lysosomal peptide degradation.
2.3. CBD3 and TAT-CBD3 peptides
CBD3 is a 15 amino acid peptide (ARSRLAELRGVPRGL484–498) derived from the calcium channel-binding domain (CBD) of collapsing
response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). The direct binding interaction
of CRMP2's CBD with the ﬁrst intracellular loop (L1) and the distal
carboxyl terminus (Ct-dis) of the alpha-1 subunit protein CaV2.2, of
the N-type voltage-gated calcium channel was the factor that led to
the identiﬁcation and isolation of the CBD3 peptide (Brittain et al.,
2011b). The peptide was originally developed to suppress inﬂammatory
and behavioral hypersensitivity associated with CaV2.2 activity.
Along with CRMP2's other four family members (viz. CRMP1 and
CRMP3–5), CRMP2 is predominantly expressed in the nervous system
during development where its microtubule interacting functions play
important roles in axonal formation and nerve terminal growth cone
collapse (Charrier et al., 2003). CRMPs are also involved in regulating
the function of ion channels and following brain trauma their degradation contributes to the neurodegenerative process (Zhang et al., 2007).
There is also evidence that CRMP2 is involved in endocytosis, as siRNA
mediated knockdown in neurons has been shown to inhibit endocytosis
of the trans-membrane cell adhesion protein L1 (Nishimura et al.,
2003).
It is thought that the CBD3 peptide competitively inhibits the interaction of CRMP2 with the intracellular domains of CaV2.2 and other ion
channels (e.g. CaV2.3), as well as glutamate receptors (e.g. NMDA receptor), and calcium transporters (e.g. NCX3), in doing so altering
their plasma membrane location and/or function and thereby their calcium inﬂux properties. Consequently, the TAT-CBD3 peptide's neuroprotective mechanism of action is commonly thought to be related to
its ability to suppress the excitotoxic inﬂux of calcium.
2.3.1. In vitro studies
TAT-CBD3 was ﬁrst shown to reduce calcium currents by around
60% in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons via a process that
was not blocked further by a CaV2.2 inhibitor (Brittain et al., 2011b).
Other in vitro studies using DRG and cortical neurons, spinal cord slices
and cortical slices showed that TAT-CBD3 also reduced several electrophysiological processes (e.g. sEPSC; spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents and CGRP release; calcitonin gene-related peptide)
associated with CaV2.2 activation (Brittain et al., 2011a,b). Interestingly,
in rat spinal cord slices following stimulation of the vanilloid receptor
subtype 1 (VR1; also known as TRPV1) with capsaicin, TAT-CBD3
reduced CGRP release. This was not considered to be the result of direct
inhibition of VR1 because of evidence that TAT-CBD3 has no effect on
VR1 recordings in DRG neurons.
In a subsequent study, a modiﬁed TAT-CBD3 peptide with an alanine
to lysine amino acid substitution (TAT-CBD3A6K) reduced T- and Rtype voltage-dependent calcium currents in DRG neurons (Piekarz
et al., 2012). Replacing the TAT peptide with poly-arginine-9 (R9) produced an even greater effect than for TAT-CBD and TAT-CBD3A6K in
terms of inhibition of neuronal calcium inﬂux and neuropathic pain
(Feldman & Khanna, 2013; Ju et al., 2013).
In terms of neuroprotection, TAT-CBD3 has been demonstrated
to reduce glutamate- and NMDA-induced calcium inﬂux in cortical
neurons as well as reducing cortical neuronal death following glutamate

exposure (Brittain et al., 2011a). The peptide also induced the
internalisation of the NMDA subunit protein NR2B in the dendritic
spines (but not cell somas) of cortical neurons, and inhibited NMDA receptor currents in hippocampal neurons (Brittain et al., 2011a). siRNA
down-regulation of CRMP2 in cortical neurons reduced the ability of
TAT-CBD3 to inhibit NMDA induced calcium inﬂux in cortical neurons,
which the authors concluded supported the idea that TAT-CBD3
antagonises a function of CRMP2 (Brittain et al., 2011a). It is of interest
therefore that in a latter study by this group (Brittain et al., 2012), it was
shown that when the TAT-CBD3 peptide was applied intracellularly, it
failed to block hippocampal neuronal NMDA receptor calcium currents.
A further study has also shown that TAT-CBD3 inhibits glutamateand NMDA-induced calcium inﬂux in cultured hippocampal neurons
(Brustovetsky et al., 2014), as well as disrupting a CRMP2–NMDA receptor complex interaction, however it did not appear to induce
internalisation of the NR2B protein. The same study demonstrated
that TAT-CBD3 also inhibits NCX-mediated calcium inﬂux, and that
CRMP2 can interact with NCX3 but not with NCX1. Surprisingly, TATCBD3 strengthened the CRMP2–NCX3 interaction rather than inhibiting
it and also induced NCX3 internalisation in hippocampal neurons.
siRNA down-regulation of CRMP2 in hippocampal neurons blocked
the ability of TAT-CBD3 to cause the NCX protein to be internalised.
In many experiments a TAT fused non-arginine containing scrambled peptide (TAT-scramble; TAT-WEAKEMLYFEALVIE; net charge
+5) with no amino acid content relationship to the CBD3 peptide was
used as a negative control (Brittain et al., 2011a,b; Brustovetsky et al.,
2014). In experiments using the TAT-scrambled peptide, negative
results similar to the vehicle control were obtained.
2.3.2. In vivo studies
Studies utilising the TAT-CBD3 peptide in different animal models of
injury/disease are presented in Table 4. The CBD3 peptide was identiﬁed
as a potential therapeutic for suppressing inﬂammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity associated with activation of the calcium channel
CaV2.2 (Brittain et al., 2011b). Initial in vivo studies established that
TAT-CBD3 reduces: i) capsaicin induced CGRP vasodilation in rat dura;
ii) pain responses in rat hind-paw and eye following formalin and capsaicin exposure respectively; and iii) neuropathic pain associated with
HIV reverse transcriptase therapy. As mentioned previously, the two
variants (TAT-CDB3:A6K and R9-CDB3) of TAT-CBD3 displayed an
increased ability to reduce neuropathic pain (Ju et al., 2013).
Following the initial in vivo studies, the neuroprotective properties
of TAT TAT-CBD3 peptide were assessed in traumatic brain injury and
animal models of stroke. In a cortical impact mouse injury model, IP administration of TAT-CBD3 5 min after injury was shown to reduce
hippocampal granular neuronal death (Brittain et al., 2011a). Similarly,
in transient MCAO in the P10 rat, IP administration of TAT-CBD3 1-hour
prior to occlusion signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume (Brittain et al.,
2012). In a similar fashion, a 14 amino acid peptide derived from
CRMP-2 (GVPRGLYDGPVCEV493–506; underlined sequence overlaps
with CDB3 peptide) and fused to TAT (TAT-CRMP-2) when administered intra-cerebroventricularly 6 h prior to MCAO also reduced infarct
volume (Bu et al., 2011).
2.2.3. Is the neuroprotective action of
TAT-CBD3 mediated by TAT or the CBD3?
It is highly likely that the CBD3 peptide acts to potentiate the neuroprotective action of TAT. The CBD3 contains four arginine residues,
resulting in a net charge for the TAT-CBD3 peptide of +11, as compared
to +8 for TAT. In our opinion, difference in net charge should have the
effect of increasing neuroprotective potency (Meloni et al., 2015). The
importance of cationic charge and the presence of arginine residues in
TAT-CDB3 peptide is further highlighted by evidence of increased efﬁcacy with respect to inhibition of evoked calcium inﬂux and pain suppression following substitution of an alanine by a lysine residue (TAT-CBD3A6K: +12) and replacement of TAT with R9 (R9-CDB3: +12) (Feldman

B.P. Meloni et al. / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 153 (2015) 36–54

& Khanna, 2013). The A6K modiﬁcation results in increased binding afﬁnity of CDB3:A6K Cav2.2, while replacement of TAT with R9 improves
peptide cell transduction. Based on our ﬁndings for poly-arginine and
arginine-rich peptide, both these modiﬁcations, especially the R9 substitution, would be expected to increase neuroprotective potency,
most likely by enhancing the peptides' endocytic properties. In this context, R9-CDB3 has been shown to be more potent than TAT-CBD3-A6K.
The control peptide used in most CBD3 studies has been a TATscrambled peptide (TAT-WEAKEMLYFEALVIE) that possesses no arginine residues and has a peptide charge of +5 due to the presence of several negatively charged glutamic acid residues. Due to its lower cationic
charge and fewer number of arginine residues compared to TAT-CBD3,
it is hardly surprising that this peptide was shown not to be neuroprotective or inhibitory to neuronal calcium inﬂux. A more appropriate control would have been a scrambled CBD3 peptide fused to TAT, which we
predict would possess neuroprotective properties due to its higher arginine content. However, in one study, a CDB3 peptide in reverse amino
acid sequence fused to TAT peptide (TAT-LGRPVGRLEALRSRA) (which
would alter CRMP2 peptide binding afﬁnity) was used as a control in a
DRG neuron depolarization-evoked calcium inﬂux studies. While the
more potent R9-CDB3 peptide at 10 μM reduced peak calcium inﬂux by
50%, the reverse control peptide at the same concentration had no inhibitory effect. Based on the chemistry of the CBD3 reverse peptide, it is possible that higher concentrations may have had an inhibitory effect.
More remarkably, and in line with a non-speciﬁc endocyticmediated down-regulation of cell surface structures, was the demonstration that TAT-CBD3 and TAT-CBD3:A6K peptides interfere with the
function of N- (Cav2.2), T- (Cav3.1–3.3) and R-type (Cav2.3) calcium
ion channels, the NMDA receptor and the NCX transporter. Moreover,
there is evidence of TAT-CBD3 induced internalisation of the NMDA
receptor subunit NR2B and NCX proteins (Brittain et al., 2011a;
Brustovetsky et al., 2014). The ﬁnding of internalisation of NR2B by
TAT-CBD3 was not conﬁrmed in another study (Brustovetsky et al.,
2014), possibly due to the ﬁxation of cells (the initial study used
live cells), a process which is likely to have altered the distribution
of endosomal contents (Lundberg et al., 2003), including NR2B protein
within the cell.
It should also be noted that siRNA down-regulation of CRMP2, which
was used to conﬁrm the speciﬁc action of the TAT-CBD3 peptide would
be expected to suppress endocytosis (Nishimura et al., 2003). Consequently, in studies on CRMP2 down-regulation, the inability of TATCBD3 to induce NCX neuronal internalisation and attenuate NCX activity may well have been due to the suppression of CRMP2-associated endocytosis of the peptide rather than TAT-CBD3 not being able to interact
with its intracellular target, CRMP2. Another anomalous ﬁnding was
that TAT-CBD3 appeared to strengthen the CRMP2-NCX interaction
rather than inhibit it (Brustovetsky et al., 2014), which is the opposite
to what would be expected if the peptide was interfering with this
protein-protein interaction.

penetrable peptide to competitively inhibit calpain cleavage of the
mGluR1 receptor.
2.4.1. In vitro and in vivo studies
In cultured cortical neurons exposed to NMDA excitotoxicity the
TAT-mGluR1 peptide reduced cell death in a dose-dependent manner
(Xu et al., 2007). The peptide was also neuroprotective in a hippocampal
slice exposed to OGD. In other models (mouse kainic acid excitotoxicity
and rat perinatal hypoxia–ischaemia; Table 5) pre-treatment with TATmGluR1 reduced mGluR1 truncation and neuronal degeneration.
Interestingly, the developers of TAT-mGluR1 were one of the ﬁrst
groups to recognise the intrinsic properties of the TAT peptide itself
and concluded that TAT and mGluR1 are likely to act synergistically
via independent mechanisms (Xu et al., 2008). These authors postulated
that the TAT peptide exerted its neuroprotective effects by altering
membrane proteins such as the NMDA receptor and affecting their function and/or structure.
2.4.2. Is the neuroprotective action of
TAT-mGluR1 mediated by TAT or the mGluR1?
Xu et al. (2008), who ﬁrst developed the TAT-mGluR1 peptide have
suggested that the TAT and mGluR1 peptides are likely to act synergistically to produce a neuroprotective effect. We believe that this view is
partly correct in that the mGluR1 peptide acts to potentiate the neuroprotective action of TAT, and that it is less likely the mGluR1 peptide is
interacting with its cytoplasmic target. The two lysine residues in the
mGluR1 peptide increase TAT/TAT-mGluR1 peptide net charge from
+8 to +11, thereby increasing the peptide's endocytic properties. The
increase in peptide charge and the potentially increased stability
due to increased length would more than likely result in greater neuroprotective potency, independently of any intracellular action of the
mGluR1 peptide.
2.5. NR2Bct and TAT-NR2Bct peptides
NR2Bct is a 14 amino acid peptide (KKNRNKLRRQHSY1292–1304) derived from the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit. The peptide sequence is
located at the intracellular carboxyl region of NR2B protein and was initially selected based on its binding afﬁnity for the death-associated protein kinase 1 protein (DAPK1) (Tu et al., 2010). DAPK1 is a calcium–
calmodulin regulated protein activated in neurons following NMDA receptor over-stimulation as occurs in ischaemia mediated excitotoxicity.
The DAPK1 protein has been shown to interact with extra-synaptic
NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunit, a process that is thought
to induce and/or exacerbate injurious calcium inﬂux (Tu et al., 2010). In
addition, activated DAPK1 is associated with other signalling pathways
linked to ischaemic cell death (Pei et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014).
TAT-NR2Bct competitively inhibits activated DAPK1 binding to the
NR2B subunit protein and thereby blocks subsequent downstream
damaging cellular events caused by NMDA receptor over-activation.

2.4. mGluR1 and TAT-mGluR1 peptides
The 14 amino acid mGluR1 peptide (VIKPLTKSYQGSGK928–942) is derived from the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1. The peptide
sequence is located at the intracellular carboxyl region of the mGluR1
protein and was initially selected based on its calpain cleavage site
(Xu et al., 2007). Following glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, calpain
cleavage of mGluR1 results in truncation of the protein at serine residue
936 (Xu et al., 2007). While truncation of mGluR1 does not inhibit the
receptor's ability to increase cytosolic calcium, it does inhibit receptormediated PI3K-Akt signalling, a process known to be associated with
neuroprotection. In theory, blockage of calpain-mediated mGluR1
cleavage following excitotoxicity should enable neurons to better
withstand excitotoxic insults due to neuroprotective signalling. Consequently, the TAT fused peptide TAT-mGluR1 was developed as a cell

2.5.1. In vitro and in vivo studies
In vitro TAT-NR2Bct is reported to block cortical neuron calcium inﬂux following NMDA stimulation and following OGD exposure, whereas
in vivo it reduces infarct volume following transient MCAO in the mouse
(Tu et al., 2010; Table 5). By contrast, a TAT scrambled control peptide
(TAT-NR2Bcts: TAT-NRRRNSLKLQHKKY) does block NMDA or OGD
induced calcium inﬂux and is equally ineffective when administered
before MCAO.
The TAT-NR2Bct peptide as well as a modiﬁed version containing an
additional peptide motif (CTK: KFERQKILDQRFFE; NR2Bct-CTM) that
directs the peptide for lysosomal degradation were also shown to reduce neuronal injury following transient MCAO in the rat with TATNR2Bct-CTM being more effective than TAT-NR2Bct (Fan et al., 2014;
Table 5). The rationale for incorporating the CTK motif was to promote

2.6.2. In vivo studies
Treatment with TAT-GluR6 but not the control TAT-GluR6AA peptide reduced MLK3/PSD-95 assembly, signalling events associated
with JNK activation (JNK and c-jun phosphorylation, Fas ligand expression) and CA1 hippocampal injury in rats in rats following intracerebroventricular administration of the peptides 40 min before the onset of
global cerebral ischaemia (Pei et al., 2006; Table 5).

degradation of NR2Bct-CTM:DAPK1 complexes and thereby improve
the peptide's ability to block the action of DAPK1.
2.5.2. Is the neuroprotective action of TAT-NR2Bct and
TAT-NR2Bct-CTM mediated by TAT or NR2Bct and NR2Bct-CTM?
TAT-NR2Bct has been shown to reduce neuronal calcium inﬂux
following excitotoxic insults (NMDA and OGD) suggesting that it is via
this mechanism that it exerts its neuroprotective action. This raises
the question of whether the reduction of calcium inﬂux is due to the interaction of TAT-NR2Bct with the intracellular domain of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B or is mediated via internalisation of calcium
channels. In this context, OGD is known to activate neuronal calcium inﬂux pathways other than via NMDA receptors (e.g. VGCC and reverse
NCX activity) and it is difﬁcult to reconcile this with the fact that TATNR2Bct is so effective at blocking net calcium inﬂux in neurons exposed
to OGD. Alternatively, if TAT-NR2Bct only acts by blocking the secondary
injurious calcium inﬂux following the interaction of activated DAPK1
with the NMDA receptor, the kinase should in theory still be available
to stimulate other non-NMDA receptor associated cell death pathways
resulting in neuronal degeneration.
Based on our hypothesis, the high arginine content and positive
charge (+14.1) of the TAT-NR2Bct would predict that the peptide is
neuroprotective and has neuronal calcium inﬂux inhibiting properties.
Consequently, it is surprising that it is reported (Tu et al., 2010) that
the TAT fused scrambled NR2Bct peptide control (TAT-NR2Bcts) does
not display any neuroprotective or calcium inﬂux inhibitory properties
despite having a similar arginine content and charge to the TATNR2Bct peptide. This anomaly led us to re-assess the effectiveness
of the scrambled TAT-NR2Bcts peptide in cultured cortical neurons exposed to glutamate excitotoxicity, and as predicted our data showed
that in our hands the peptide is neuroprotective (Fig. 4).

2.6.3. Is the neuroprotective action of
TAT-GluR6 mediated by TAT or GluR6?
The TAT-GluR6 peptide has a charge of +9, while the TAT-GluR6AA
peptide has a charge of +8, which is the same as the TAT peptide.
Consequently, it is predicted that an additional charge should increase
the neuroprotective potency of TAT-GluR6 peptide. However, the fact
that the TAT-GluR6AA control peptide is not neuroprotective despite
having the same charge as TAT is problematic, but may be explained
by the presence of two introduced alanine residues, which may well
have a negative impact on the peptide's neuroprotective properties by
impeding peptide endocytosis (Yang et al., 2014).
2.7. p53DM and TAT-p53DM peptides
p53DM is a 12 amino acid peptide (RVCACPGRDRRT271–282) derived
from the p53 tumour suppressor protein (Wang et al., 2014). The peptide sequence is located within a p53 DNA-binding motif (DM) that
also binds activated DAPK1, which can subsequently phosphorylate
p53 at serine-23. Thus, the p53DM peptide acts to inhibit the DAPK1p53 binding interaction and p53 phosphorylation, with phosphorylated
p53 being known to induce the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins
(e.g. Bax) and cell death.
2.7.1. In vitro and in vivo studies
Treatment of cortical neurons with a TAT-fused p53DM peptide
(TAT-p53DM) has been shown to reduce the number of terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelled and propidium iodide positive neurons following OGD compared to a scrambled control
peptide (TAT-s-p53DM; TAT-CCPGECVRTRRR) (Pei et al., 2014). However, in experiments involving OGD exposure, a vehicle control was
not used. Treatment of mice with TAT-p53DM (but not the TAT-fused
scrambled control peptide, TAT-s-p53DM) 3 or 6 h after the commencement of transient MCAO (60 min) similarly reduces brain injury and
improves functional outcomes (Wang et al., 2014; Table 5).

2.6. GluR6 and TAT-GluR6 peptides
The 12 amino acid GluR6 peptide (RLPGKETMA900–908) is derived
from the carboxyl terminal of kainic acid receptor GluR6 subunit,
which binds to the PDZ1 domain of the PSD-95 protein (Pei et al.,
2006; Table 5). As a result, the peptide has the capacity to inhibit
GluR6 receptor-PSD-95 signalling, which following over-receptor stimulation can result in activation of JNK and other cell death associated
pathways.
2.6.1. In vitro studies
Electrophysiological studies have shown that TAT-GluR6 (0.05 μM)
has no inhibitory effects on kainic acid receptor function and is neuroprotective in vitro, signiﬁcantly reducing hippocampal neuronal death
following kainic acid exposure (Pei et al., 2006). By contrast, a control
peptide in which the carboxyl ETMA peptide motif is replaced by the
amino acids AADD (RLPGKAADD; TAT-GluR6AA) is not neuroprotective.

2.7.2. Is the neuroprotective action of
TAT-p53DM mediated by TAT or p53DM?
Both TAT-p53DM and TAT-s-p53DM are arginine-rich and have a net
charge of +10.9 and therefore would be predicted to both have neuroprotective properties. Studies in our laboratory have conﬁrmed that
TAT-s-p53DM is neuroprotective in vitro in cortical neurons exposed

to glutamic acid excitotoxicity (Fig. 4). TAT-s-p53DM peptide was however, slightly less effective than the TAT-p53DM peptide. One possible
reason for the differential neuroprotective effects of the two peptides
is that in s-p53DM, all arginine residues are located at the C-terminus
of the peptide away from the TAT arginine (and lysine) residues. In contrast, p53DM has one of its arginine residues at the N-terminus adjacent
to the TAT peptide and therefore may have a greater capacity to enhance
the neuroprotective efﬁcacy of TAT.
2.8. CN21, AIP, TAT-CN21 and TAT-AIP peptides
CN21 is a 21 amino acid peptide (KRPPKLGQIGRSKRVVIEDDR43–63)
derived from the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
inhibitor (CaM-KIIN) protein. As its name suggests, CaM-KIIN is an inhibitor of kinase calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII).
The CN21 is also a speciﬁc inhibitor of CaMKII (Vest et al., 2007). AIP
(autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide) is a 13 amino acid peptide
(RKKLRRQEADAL) derived from but not homologous to the autoregulatory domain of CaMKII, that can inhibit multiple members of the
CaMKII-kinase family (Ishida et al., 1995; Smith et al., 1990).
The CaMKII protein is a mediator of many calcium associated signalling pathways. In the brain, CaMKII is involved in physiological glutamate receptor signalling but following receptor over-stimulation,
the kinase is activated and autophosphylated, processes believed to be
involved in cell death pathways (Liu et al., 2012).
2.8.1. In vitro and in vivo studies
The TAT fused CN21 peptide (TAT-CN21) was shown to be neuroprotective in in vitro following both glutamic acid and NMDA excitotoxicity
in hippocampal and cortical neuronal cultures (Vest et al., 2010). By contrast, a TAT-fused CN21 reverse sequence (RDDEIVVRKSRGIQGLKPPRK)
and a scrambled CN21 peptide (VKEPRIDGKPVRLRGQKSDRI) at 5 μM
were shown to be equally ineffective as neuroprotective agents following
glutamate excitotoxicity. In another study, both TAT-CN21 and TAT-AIP
were established to be neuroprotective in cultured cortical neurons
following glutamic acid excitotoxicity (Ashpole & Hudmon, 2011),
with the TAT-AIP peptide having slightly greater potency than
TATCN21. In the same study, TAT peptide (10 μM) was shown to be
neuroprotective, while a control mutated TAT-CN21 peptide (TATCN21Ala; with seven alanine amino acid and one tryptophan substitutions: KAPAKAAWAAASKRVVIEDDR) had signiﬁcantly lower neuroprotective properties. TAT-CN21 has also been shown to reduce infarct
volume in a transient MCAO (60 min) mouse stroke model when
administered after reperfusion (Vest et al., 2010; Table 5).
2.8.2. Is the neuroprotective action of
TAT-CN21 and TAT-AIP mediated by TAT or CN21/AIP?
TAT-CN21 and TAT-AIP have net peptide charges of +12 and +11,
respectively compared to +8 for the TAT peptide. Consequently, based
on our hypothesis, it would be predicted that when fused to TAT, the additional cationic charge provided by CN21 and AIP should increase the
neuroprotective potency of TAT. As discussed, it appears that TAT-AIP
is slightly more neuroprotective than TAT-CN21. This may be due to
the fact that all the positively charged arginine and lysine residues in
AIP are located at its N-terminal region adjacent to the TAT peptide,
whereas CN21 has a more even distribution of these residues across
its structure. It is also hardly surprising that the TAT-CN21Ala control
peptide displayed signiﬁcantly lower neuroprotective properties compared to TAT-CN21 given its high alanine content and reduced charge
(+9), factors of which we would be expected to lead to reduce peptided
endocytic efﬁciency (Yang et al., 2014).
2.9. Indip and TAT-Indip peptides
Indip is a 10 amino acid peptide (GEPHKFKREW152–161) derived from
insulin-induced gene 1 (Insig-1) protein (Taghibiglou et al., 2009). One of

the roles of Insig-1 is to regulate the intracellular trafﬁcking of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1). In non-stimulated neurons, SREBP-1 forms a complex with SREBP cleavage-activating protein
(SCAP), which is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) due to the
interaction of SCAP with the ER membrane protein Insig-1. Following
NMDA receptor activation, Insig-1 lysine residues 156 and 158 are
ubiquitinated and the protein degraded by the proteosome, thereby releasing SCAP from the ER membrane and allowing the protein to chaperone SREBP-1 to the Golgi apparatus. Within the Golgi apparatus, SREBP-1
is proteolytically cleaved to its transcriptional active N-terminal form
(nt-SREBP-1), after which it translocates to the nucleus to stimulate the
expression of genes containing sterol regulatory elements. The exact
mechanisms associated with activated SREBP-1 and its role in neuronal
injury are not known, however blocking Insig-1 degradation with the
TAT-Indip peptide has been shown to be neuroprotective in NMDA induced excitotoxicity and OGD in cortical cultures (Taghibiglou et al.,
2009). The Indip peptide was initially designed to competitively block
ubiquitination of Insig-1 lysines residues 156 and 158, and thereby inhibit
its degradation allowing maintenance of SREBP-1's anchorage to the ER
membrane.
2.9.1. In vitro studies
The TAT fused Indip peptide (TAT-Indip) is reported to be neuroprotective (2 μM) in vitro in cultured neurons in both NMDA excitotoxicity
and OGD (Taghibiglou et al., 2009). By contrast, a TAT fused mutated
Indip peptide (2 μM: TAT-GEPHRFRREW; TAT-IndipK–R), in which lysine
residues 156 and 158 are replaced with arginine residues, was shown to
be ineffective.
2.9.2. In vivo studies
Treatment of rats with the TAT-Indip peptide 45 min before MCAO
(90 min) or 30 min after reperfusion signiﬁcantly reduces infarct
volume (Taghibiglou et al., 2009; Table 5). The control peptide TATIndipK–R administered 30 min after reperfusion was shown to be ineffective resulting in infarct volumes equivalent to those in vehicle treated
rats.
2.9.3. Is the neuroprotective action of TAT-Indip mediated by TAT or Indip?
Both the TAT-Indip and TAT-IndipK–R peptides have a net peptide
charge +9.1 compared to +8 for the TAT peptide, which based on our
hypothesis, leads us to predict that the TAT-IndipK–R due to its higher arginine content should be more neuroprotective than TAT-Indip. The fact
that the opposite was observed is surprising. This led us to re-examine
the potency of the two peptides in cortical neurons exposed to glutamate excitotoxicity. In our hands, both peptides are neuroprotective
with the TAT-IndipK–R peptide appearing to be more potent than the
TAT-Indip peptide as we predicted (Fig. 4).
2.10. Src, Src40–49-TAT and TAT-Src40–58 peptides
Src40–49 is a 10 amino acid peptide (KPASADGHRG39–48 equivalent
to the mouse sequence peptide region 39–48) and Scr40–58, a 19 amino
acid peptide (PASADGHRGPSAAFVPPAA40–58), derived from the protein
kinase Src protein. It has been reported that the Src peptides can bind to
the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2.1) protein (Liu et al., 2008).
The Src protein can use ND2.1 as well as PSD-95 as adaptor proteins to
indirectly bind to the NR2B NMDA receptor subunit. Intracellular signalling events following tissue injury and inﬂammation can trigger the Src
protein to bind to and phosphorylate the NR2B subunit (at tyrosine residue 1472). This process can inhibit NMDA receptor endocytosis, and
thus promote increased surface expression of the NMDA receptor
(Zhang et al., 2008). Increased NMDA receptor expression/activity can
be associated with chronic pain, pain hypersensitivity and emotional
memory. The rationale for designing the Src40–49 peptide was to
block the Src-ND2 protein interaction and thereby inhibit NMDA receptor phosphorylation and hyperactivity without disrupting normal

B.P. Meloni et al. / Pharmacology & Therapeutics 153 (2015) 36–54

receptor function (Liu et al., 2008). The TAT-Src40–58 peptide was
designed to block the interaction of Src with the PSD-95/NR2B protein
complex and thereby reduce NMDA receptor surface expression.
2.10.1. In vitro studies
Studies using the longer TAT-Src40–58 peptide (TAT-PASADGHRG
PSAAFVPPAA) were performed in mouse amygdala neuronal cultures
and brain slices (Sinai et al., 2010). Since it had been previously demonstrated that inhibiting phosphorylation of tyrosine (Y1472) on the
NMDA receptor subunit NR2B causes receptor endocytosis (Zhang
et al., 2008), it was predicted that adding TAT-Src40–58 to the neuronal
cultures would decrease NR2B surface expression. As predicted,
treatment of the neuronal cultures with peptide (20 μM) resulted in
NR2B internalisation, resulting in a N50% reduction in receptor protein
surface expression in dendritic processes compared to controls (Sinai
et al., 2010). Similarly, treating brain slices with the peptide reduced
amygdalar long-term potentiation in the lateral nuclei of the basolateral
complex. Controls consisting of TAT only or scrambled TAT-Srr40–58
peptides were not used in the experiments.
2.10.2. In vivo studies
IV administration of Src40–49-TAT (KPASADGHRG-TAT) 45 min before hind paw formalin injection, or intrathecal administration at the
lumbar level 30 min before hindpaw injection reduced phase 2 NMDA
receptor-dependent ﬂinching (Liu et al., 2008; Table 5). By contrast, a
scrambled sSrc40–49 peptide (GAAKPRSDGH-TAT; sSrc40–49-TAT) and
the TAT peptide alone did not have any effect. Moreover, IV and/or intrathecally administered Scr40–49-TAT, but not vehicle or sScr40–49-TAT,
also reduced inﬂammatory pain and pain behaviour in a model of peripheral nerve injury (Liu et al., 2008). Coincidentally, Src40–49-TAT has also
been shown to reduce Src binding to ND2.1 and NR2B phosphorylation in
rat brain and spinal cord lysates, following IV or intrathecal peptide treatment in normal rats or rats subjected to inﬂammatory and neuropathic
pain (Liu et al., 2008).
In another study, intravenous injection of the longer TAT-Scr40–58
peptide (but not vehicle control or scrambled TAT-Scr40–58) reduced
NR2B tyrosine phosphorylation in the mouse amygdala compared
to vehicle control and scrambled TAT-Scr40–58 treated rats (Sinai
et al., 2010; Table 5). IV administered TAT-Scr40–58 also impaired
amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning and non-associative social
recognition tasks in mice. It was concluded that both responses were
linked to TAT-Scr40–58 mediated reduced NMDA receptor surface
expression.
2.10.3. Are the neurological effects induced
by Src40–49TAT and TAT-Src40–58 mediated by TAT?
The Src40–49TAT and TAT-Src40–58 peptides are intriguing as their
active components (Src40–49 and Src40–59 peptides) are predicted to
cause NR2B/NMDA receptor endocytosis and reduced surface expression. Similarly, we have proposed that TAT-mediated peptide cellular
uptake may result in NMDA receptor internalisation and reduced surface expression. There are several pieces of evidence suggesting that
the latter mechanism is occurring. In both studies described above, the
authors were unable to adequately reconcile why their peptides were
so effective at reducing Src kinase NMDA receptor mediated responses
when the closely related Src family member Fyn is another kinase capable of phosphorylating the NR2B subunit at tyrosine 1472, including
when associated with neuropathic pain (Abe et al., 2005; Nakazawa
et al., 2001). That is, Fyn kinase activity, which is not blocked by the
Src40–49TAT and TAT-Src40–58 peptides, would be capable of phosphorylating NR2B and inhibit endocytosis of the NMDA receptor, and
allow pain to occur. However, this was not the case and thus it is
more likely that a TAT-mediated peptide mechanism was responsible
for NMDA receptor endocytosis and reduced pain.
Moreover, it has been shown that Src, in addition to binding the ND2
protein can bind the PSD-95 protein to facilitate phosphorylation of

49

tyrosine NR2B, a process that would not be blocked by the Src40–49TAT and TAT-Src40–58 peptides. Given this, we argue that the reduced
NMDA receptor activated processes reported above are the result of the
TAT peptide's endocytic properties. These endocytic effects may have
been enhanced by the actions of the Src peptide to increase TAT's stability or endocytic uptake independent of the cargo-peptide's potential indirect cytoplasmic inducing endocytic effects.
3. Examination neuroprotective
arginine- (and lysine-) rich peptides used in neuronal injury models
It is beyond the scope of this review to include every study that has
used a neuroprotective TAT-fused peptide. For completeness, other
in vivo studies using TAT-fused peptides are listed in Table 5. Evidently,
several studies have identiﬁed arginine- and lysine-rich peptides not
fused to TAT or a CPP as being neuroprotective. We argue that it is
possible that these peptides are intrinsically neuroprotective via mechanisms unrelated to their proposed action on a speciﬁc cell surface receptor or intracellular target. Like TAT, the neuroprotective effects of
poly-arginine and arginine-rich peptides are likely to be related to
their endocytosis-inducing properties. To pursue this idea further,
here we review in detail the properties of two arginine- and lysinerich peptides that meet these criteria, apolipoprotein E (APOE) derived
peptides and an amyloid precursor protein (APP) derived peptide.
Animal studies that have used these peptides in CNS injury models are
presented in Table 6.
3.1. APOE peptides — APOE141–149, COG133 and COG1410
The APOE141–1491 and COG133 peptides are derived form the
APOE protein (LRKLRKRLL141–149 and LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL133–149)
and represent a region within the protein's receptor binding domain.
Interestingly, an early study using a dimer of the APOE141–1491 peptide showed that the peptide was capable of inducing signiﬁcant increases in intracellular calcium inﬂux in cultured neurons, especially
at concentrations of ≥5 μM (Wang & Gruenstein, 1997). By contrast,
the APOE141–1491 monomer peptide was less effective at inducing
intracellular calcium inﬂux even at high concentrations (100 μM). The
mechanism associated with the COG1410 peptide induced calcium
inﬂux was proposed to be linked to peptide binding to the low-density
lipoprotein receptor (Wang & Gruenstein, 1997).
A subsequent study showed that the COG133 peptide reduced cell
death and calcium inﬂux in mixed cortical–glial cultures following
NMDA excitotoxicity (Aono et al., 2003). Neuroprotection was seen
when the COG133 peptide was added to cortical cultures prior to or
concurrently with NMDA but not a scrambled peptide of the identical
size and amino acid composition. It is of interest that poly-arginine
and arginine-rich peptides behave in a similar fashion to COG133 with
respect to calcium inﬂux and neuroprotection following glutamic acid
excitotoxicity (Meloni et al., 2015).
In other studies it has been shown that intravascular administration
of the COG133 peptide reduced the systemic and brain inﬂammatory
responses induced by cytokines (e.g. TNF-α) and led to improved
outcomes after closed head injury in the mouse (Lynch et al., 2003,
2005). Similarly, intraperitoneal administration of the COG133 peptide
reduced disability and inﬂammatory inﬁltrates in to the spinal cord of
a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (Li et al., 2006). A slightly shorter
and modiﬁed COG133 peptide (COG1410: acetyl-AS-Aib-LRKL-AibKRLL-amide; Aib = 2-Aminoisobutyric acid) with superior antiinﬂammatory properties has also been developed, and has shown to reduce vasospasm and/or lead to improved outcome in subarachnoid and
intracerebral haemorrhage in the mouse (Gao et al., 2006; Laskowitz
et al., 2012). In addition, COG1410 peptide improves functional and/or
histological outcomes in different traumatic brain injury models
(Hoane et al., 2007; Hoane et al., 2009; Jiang & Brody, 2012; Kaufman
et al., 2010; Laskowitz et al., 2007), in transient MCAO (Tukhovskaya

et al., 2009) and perinatal hypoxia–ischaemia models (McAdoo et al.,
2005). Finally in a transgenic Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease,
COG133 alone or when fused to the CPP penetratin (COG12) has been
shown to reduce neurodegeneration and restore cognitive functions.
The mechanism whereby COG133 and its variant peptides exert
their neuroprotective, calcium inﬂux inhibitory and anti-inﬂammatory
effects is not fully understood, but is assumed to be associated with
the peptide's binding to APOE receptors (e.g. low-density lipoprotein;
LDL, lipoprotein receptor-related protein; LRP, apolipoprotein E receptor 2).
3.1.1. What is the neuroprotective mechanism
of APOE141–149, COG133 and COG1410 peptides?
Due mainly to their arginine and lysine residues the COG133 and
COG1410 peptides have a net charge of +7.1 and +6.1 respectively,
and therefore we would predict that these peptides should possess
mild endocytic properties and as has been reported to be neuroprotective and reduce calcium inﬂux following excitotoxicity (Aono et al.,
2003). Indeed our own assessment of the COG133 peptide in cultured
cortical neurons exposed to glutamate excitotoxicity showed that the
peptide has mild neuroprotective effects (Fig. 4).
3.2. APP peptide — APP96–110
The APP96–110 is a 15 amino acid peptide (NWCKRGRKQCKTHPH)
derived from the heparin-binding site within the D1 domain of
the APP (Corrigan et al., 2014). The APP96–110 peptide is thought to
represent one of the neuroprotective regions (the other being the D6a
domain) within the secreted amyloid-β precursor protein-α. The D1
domain is considered a growth factor-like domain and interestingly it
has been hypothesised that its neuroprotective properties may be related to its ability to bind HSPGs (Corrigan et al., 2011).
The APP96–110 peptide has been assessed for neuroprotective effects in traumatic brain injury models in APP−/− knock-out mice
and normal rats (Corrigan et al., 2014). Intra-cerebroventricular peptide administration was shown to improve both histological and
functional outcomes, and was effective whether administered pre- or
post-insult. By contrast, a mutated form of the peptide (mAPP96–110:
NWCNQGGKQCKTHPH) speciﬁcally designed to reduce the ability
of the peptide to bind heparin, by replacing positively charged arginine and lysine residues, was ineffective in traumatic brain injury in
the rat.

3.2.1. What is the neuroprotective mechanism of APP96–100?
The APP96–110 peptide was synthesised with an acetylated Nterminal and an amidated C-terminal to minimise peptide proteolytic
degradation and has a net charge of +5.1. The mutated form of the peptide has a net charge of +2.1. As mentioned above, it was hypothesised
by the developers of APP96–110 that the peptide's neuroprotective
mechanism is related to its HSPG binding properties. The developers
of APP96–110, have conﬁrmed that this peptide had a strong binding afﬁnity for the highly sulphated glycosaminoglycan molecule, heparin
(Corrigan et al., 2014). By contrast, the mutated peptide mAPP96–110
has signiﬁcantly reduced binding afﬁnity for heparin. Despite the heparin binding properties of the APP96–110 peptide, its mechanism of
action is not exactly known, although some form of interaction with
cell surface receptors (e.g. FGFRs, APP, APLP1, APLP2) and the activation
of signalling pathways has been proposed (Corrigan et al., 2014). However, it appears likely that APP96–100 behaves in a similar fashion to
neuroprotective poly-arginine and arginine-rich peptides by binding
cell surface HSPGs, and in doing so triggering peptide endosomal
uptake. On this basis, we conclude that the endocytic properties of
APP96–110 are integral to the peptide's neuroprotective mechanism
of action.

4. Discussion and concluding remarks
The main purpose of this review is to describe the neuroprotective
properties of peptides fused to the arginine-rich CPP, TAT and in doing
so provide evidence supportive of our hypothesis that neuroprotection
is mediated not by the cargo molecule but largely by TAT itself. This hypothesis crystallised for us following the analysis of the neuroprotective
and calcium inﬂux inhibiting properties of a diverse set of peptides including: 1) arginine-rich CPPs (TAT, penetratin); 2) poly-arginine peptides (R3, R6, R7–15, R18); 3) several CPP-fused peptides (e.g. TATJNKI-1, TAT-PYC36, kFGF-JNKI-1); 4) several arginine-rich peptides
(e.g. BEN0254, BEN1079, NCXBP3, XIP); 5) poly-lysine-10 (K10) and a
poly-arginine-9 fused poly-glutamic acid-9 peptide (E9/R9); and 6) a
non-arginine, non-endocytic CPP (kFGF) (Meloni et al., 2015). What
became increasingly clear from this analysis was that peptide neuroprotection is associated with peptide cationic charge. In particular, arginine
and to a lesser extent lysine and tryptophan amino acid residues appear
to be important determinants of neuroprotective potency.
Other studies have added weight to our hypothesis. For example, evidence that endocytosis is essential for TAT-JNKI-1 neuroprotection
(Vaslin et al., 2011) and the observation that CPP-fused CDB3 peptides
can induce internalisation of NR2B, NCX and CaV2.2 membrane proteins. Another interesting and largely unexplained ﬁnding is that most
TAT-fused and arginine-rich peptides are effective as neuroprotectants
in neuronal excitotoxicity models in the μM range (e.g. 1–10 μM) rather
than the nM range (e.g. 10–100 nM or 0.01–0.1 μM). Our interpretation
of this is that in order to be neuroprotective, a peptide must reach a critical concentration at the plasma membrane in order to induce endocytic
internalisation of cell surface structures.
Recent ﬁndings suggests that cationic peptide charge conferred by
arginine and lysine residues facilitates electrostatic interactions with
cell surface HSPGs followed by arginine induced heparin sulphate clustering and endocytosis (Amand et al., 2012; Wallbrecher et al., 2014;
Yang et al., 2014). Additionally, there is evidence that tryptophan residues within basic peptides can also promote proteoglycan binding and
endocytosis (Bechara et al., 2013; Rydberg et al., 2012), while alanine
resides have been shown to impede peptide–proteoglycan binding
(Yang et al., 2014). Interestingly, the replacement of 1 to 3 arginine residues in poly-arginine-6 with the equivalent number of tryptophan residues increases the ability of the peptide to block NMDA receptor
activity in amphibian oocytes (Ferrer-Montiel et al., 1988). Consistent
with these observations, we have demonstrated that a 15mer consisting
of 10 arginine and 5 tryptophan resides (WRRRWRRRRWWRRRW) is
more neuroprotective than R15 in a cultured cortical neurons exposed
to glutamic acid excitotoxicity, with an arginine/alanine peptide
(ARRRARRRRAARRRA) being slightly less effective (Fig. 1).
There is emerging evidence that the presence of other amino acids or
the amino acids sequence itself may decrease or increase peptide endocytosis and neuroprotective efﬁcacy. In an earlier study, we reported
that only 5 out of 19 TAT-fused peptides displayed signiﬁcant neuroprotection in cortical neurons exposed to glutamic acid excitotoxicity
(Meade et al., 2010b). Similarly, the addition of three amino acids to
TAT (PKIGRKKRRQRRRG; AM8D-TAT) signiﬁcantly increases peptide
in vitro efﬁcacy (Meade et al., 2010a). Therefore, it appears likely
that in addition to arginine content and peptide charge, other amino
acids most likely by inﬂuencing peptide secondary and tertiary structure can inﬂuence the endocytic and neuroprotective properties
of arginine-rich and TAT-fused peptides. Ultimately, however, we
recognise that additional in vitro and in vivo studies are required to unequivocally prove our hypothesis. Moreover, we cannot rule out the
possibility that other peptide induced neuroprotective mechanisms
are also operating, since it has been demonstrated that CPPs can exert
intracellular biological effects by altering gene expression and the activity of kinases and proteolytic enzymes (Brugnano et al., 2010).
Finally, we speculate that by altering amino acid residue content and
sequence within arginine-rich peptides it may be possible to develop

52

peptides with a greater capacity to target speciﬁc cell surface structures
within the CNS and PNS, thereby providing a way to improve drug
speciﬁcity for a range of neurological disorders such as epilepsy, pain, depression, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. It may equally be
possible to develop arginine-rich peptides that can target cell surface receptors associated with the pathogenesis of non-neurological disorders.
