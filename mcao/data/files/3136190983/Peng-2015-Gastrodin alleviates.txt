Abstract Gastrodin (GAS), an active constituent of the
Chinese herbal medicine Tianma, has anti-oxidant and
anti-inflammation activities but its protective effect to the
prevention of neurotoxicity induced by ischemic stroke is
unclear. In the present study, middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) was used to establish a mice ischemic
stroke model. Infarct volume ratio and neurobehavioral
score were evaluated, Nissl staining was performed and the
expression of cleaved Caspase 3, Bax and B cell lymphoma
2 (Bcl-2) were assessed at 24 h or 7 days after reperfusion.
In addition, the total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity
and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, as well as the
expression of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2
(Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), SOD1, phospho-Akt
and total Akt and TNF-a and IL-1b in the ischemic
hemispheres were also observed at 6 h after reperfusion to
assess oxidative stress and inflammatory changes after
GAS treatment. It was found that GAS, especially at high

dose (100 mg/kg) reduced tested neuronal injury and
neurobehavioral deficient in MCAO mice. Enhanced
expression of cleaved Caspase 3 and Bax and decreased
expression of Bcl-2 by MCAO were also reversed by GAS.
Moreover, GAS treatment decreased the MDA content and
the expression of TNF-a and IL-1b, and increased amount
of SOD activity and the expression of HO-1 and SOD1 in
GAS-treated ischemic brain. Furthermore, GAS significantly increased Akt phosphorylation and Nrf2 expression.
These results support the neuroprotective effects of GAS,
and the activation of Akt/Nrf2 pathway may play a critical
role in the pharmacological action of GAS.

Stroke is one of the primary causes of severe acquired
disability worldwide [1]. The sudden blockage of blood

flow from a thrombus or embolism causes about 80 % of
all stroke victims experienced an ischemic event [2, 3].
Administration of the thrombolytic agent tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an efficient treatment and it is still
the only FDA approved therapy for acute ischemic stroke
[4, 5]. However, tPA has many shortcomings including the
potential risk of hemorrhagic transformation, limited therapeutic window and efficacy [6, 7]. Thus, cerebral ischemia
is still a major medical problem and novel and effective
therapeutic approaches are still urgently required.
The exact mechanisms responsible for the brain damage
suffering from ischemic insult are still not fully understood; there are increasing evidence suggesting that postischemia oxidative stress and inflammation are significant
contributing factors to the pathogenic process [8–11].
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are found greatly elevated
which could exceed the antioxidant capacity of the ischemic brain, thus activate diverse signaling pathways and
result in oxidative stress [12, 13], and ROS could initiate
the expression of inflammatory cytokines [14], including
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1b (IL-1b)
and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Meanwhile, studies reported that
systemic administration of antioxidants or anti-inflammatory agents could improve neurological deficit, reduce
brain edema and infarct sizes and regulate cytokines
expression in the cortex [15–17]. It suggests that agents
with anti-oxidative or anti-inflammatory effects might be
benefit for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.
Gastrodia elata Blume, known as tianma in Chinese, is a
plant of the orchidaceae family, has been used for thousands of years in China. Pharmacological studies indicate
that tianma has analgesic, nootropic, and anti-inflammatory
effects, and improves microcirculation and general circulatory functions [18, 19]. The phenolic glucoside gastrodin
(GAS) is a main phenolic compound derived from Gastrodia elata Blume root [20]. Studies indicate that GAS has
a neuroprotective action against hypoxia in cultured cortical neuron [21], and GAS could inhibit the expression of
inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 and proinflammatory cytokines in cultured LPS-stimulated
microglia [22]. It may also improve learning ability and
facilitate memory consolidation and retrieval [23]. Our
previous study also showed that GAS could reduce the
levels of IL-6 and IL-1b, down-regulate the expression of
iNOS and inhibite p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the
hippocampus of posttraumatic stress disorder model [24],
and GAS could also reverse the expression of phosphoinhibitor of kappa B (p-ijB), nuclear factor-kappa B (NFjB), and IL-1b of hippocampus in chronic unpredictable
stress rats and protect hippocampal derived neural stem cell
from IL-1b-induced damage [25], suggesting that GAS
may suppress specific signaling pathways associated with
the inflammatory response. Moreover, recent studies

123

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:661–673

showed that the beneficial effects of gastrodin might result
from its antioxidant properties [26]. GAS could protect
primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons against amyloidbeta peptide-induced neurotoxicity and attenuate the
reduction of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase
(SOD) expression via the activation of ERK1/2-Nrf2
pathway [27]. These observations lead to the hypothesis
that GAS may provide neuroprotection against ischemic
brain injury. To test this possibility, we investigated the
potential neuroprotective efficacy of GAS in a mouse
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. We also
explored its anti-oxidative effects by assessing oxidativerelated factors against stroke damage induced by MCAO in
mice.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Animals and Drug Injection
The C57BL/6 J mice in this study were obtained from the
Experimental Animal Center at the Fourth Military Medical University, Xi’an, China. The animals were housed at
21 ± 2 °C, with 60–70 % humidity for at least 1 weeks
before surgery. They were also under a fixed 12-h light/
dark cycle and had free access to food and water. Procedures for animals were reviewed and approved by the
Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the
Fourth Military Medical University.
GAS (purity [99.2 %) was supplied by Kunming
Pharmaceutical Corporation (Kunming, China). In the
present study, GAS was dissolved in saline and administered intraperitoneally to all GAS groups at the same time.
The doses were chosen according to previous pharmacological studies of GAS in rats [28, 29] and adjusted into
dose for mice according to our preliminary tests. After the
adaptive phase, mice were randomly divided into five
groups: sham (only received saline), MCAO ? vehicle
(saline), MCAO ? GAS (L) (low-dose, L = 10 mg/kg),
MCAO ? GAS (M) (medium dose, M = 50 mg/kg),
MCAO ? GAS (H) (high-dose, H = 100 mg/kg). Saline
or GAS were immediately injected intraperitoneally at the
onset of cerebral reperfusion.
Induction of Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia
The focal cerebral ischemia was induced by MCAO with
an intraluminal filament as described previously [30, 31].
Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 2 % isoflurane carried
by 2 L/min oxygen through a face mask. Six-0 monofilament nylon suture with a rounded tip (Beijing, shadong)
was inserted through a small incision on the right common
carotid artery and forwarded into the internal carotid artery

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:661–673

until a small resistance was felt. And the filament was fixed
with silk suture knot on the common carotid artery. After
1 h, the filament was slowly withdrawn to allow reperfusion. Regional cerebral blood (rCBF) flow was monitored
using laser Doppler flowmetry (Perimed AB, PeriFlux
System 5000, Stockholm, Sweden) in the ipsilateral cortex.
MCAO was considered successful if rCBF sharply
decreased below 30 % of baseline; successful reperfusion
was considered if rCBF was recovered up to 80 % of
baseline. Otherwise, animals were excluded from analysis
and sacrificed by anesthesia death. The mice in sham group
were not experienced middle cerebral artery occlusion;
they just anesthetized with 2 % isoflurane and exposed
their carotid artery. The insufficient ischemia rate is 15 %,
and the premature death is 10 %.
Neurological Deficit Evaluation and Infarct Assessment
Neurological deficits were monitored 24 h or 7 days after
vascular occlusion using the 6-point scoring system [32] by
a blinded observer. Mice were scored as follows: zero, no
apparent deficits; one, failure to extend left forepaw fully if
pulled by the tail; two: left contralateral circling if pulled
by the tail; three: circling or walking to the left; four:
walking only if stimulated; five: unresponsiveness to
stimulation and with depressed level of consciousness.
Immediately after neurological deficit evaluation, mice
were decapitated and brains were dissected into six equal
thickness coronal slices (1 mm per slice) and immediately
stained with 2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA, T8877) at 37 °C for
10 min. The infarct volumes were evaluated with the following formula: (total contralateral hemispheric volume - total ipsilateral hemispheric stained volume)/total
contralateral hemispheric volume 9 100.
Nissl Staining
At 24 h or 7 days after reperfusion, mice were subjected to
deep anesthesia with 300 mg/kg i.p. chloral hydrate and
perfused with saline followed by ice cold 4 % paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer through transcardiac perfusion. Brain tissues were then extracted and post-fixed in
4 % paraformaldehyde for 2 h at 4 °C. After successively
infiltrated with 0.1 M PBS containing 20 and 25 % sucrose
overnight, 10 lm coronal sections were cut with a cryostat
(Leica, CM 1950) and stored at -20 °C until use. Nissl
staining kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China)
was used to detect the numbers of morphologically normal
neurons and neurons showing the features of ischemic cell
change (shrunken cell bodies, triangulated, pyknotic nuclei,
and eosinophilic cytoplasm) by two blinded investigators
using ImagePro Plus 5.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc.,

663

Bethesda, MD). Neurons were counted in 10 different
fields in each region in the cortex (primary somatosensory
cortex, S1) and CA1 of hippocampus. The percentage of
ischemic neurons was calculated through dividing the sum
of ischemic neuron number by the total number of neurons
in the 10 defined areas [33].
Measurement of Cerebral MDA and SOD Levels
Cerebral content of MDA, the product of lipid peroxidation, was measured according to the method by a detection
kit purchased from Beyotime Institution of China. The
absorbance of the supernatant was measured by spectrophotometry at 532 nm. Total cerebral SOD activity was
determined using detection kits from Jiancheng Bio Institution, Nanjing, China, and the absorbance of the supernatant were measured by spectrophotometry at 450 nm.
Western Blotting
The ischemic hemispheres were lysed with SDS-PAGE
sample buffer composed of 62.5 mM Tris–HCI, 2 % w/v
SDS, 10 % glycerol, 50 mM DTT, and 0.1 % w/v bromphenol blue. After homogenization, extracts were clarified
via centrifugation at 12,000g for 10 min. The supernatant
was collected as the total cellular protein extract. Nuclear
extracts were prepared using a NEPER Nuclear Extraction
Kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer instructions. The
protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Aliquots of the
lysates with loading buffer (Beyotime Institution of China)
were boiled for 10 min. and then cooled to room temperature. For western blot analysis, equal amounts of protein
(20–40 mg) were separated with SDS polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and blotted onto PVDF membranes (Millipore). Membrane was blocked with 5 % skim milk in Tris
buffered saline (TBS) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C
with the primary antibodies as follow: rabbit anti-Nrf2
antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit antiHO-1 antibody (1:500, Enzo Life Sciences), mouse antiphospho-Akt antibody (1:1,000, Cell Signaling), rabbit
anti-total Akt antibody (1:1,000, Cell Signaling), rabbit
anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling),
rabbit anti-Bcl-2 antibody (1:2,000, Abcam) or rabbit antiBax antibody (1:2,500, Abcam), rabbit anti-IL-1b antibody
(1:400, Abcam), goat anti-TNF-a antibody (Santa Cruz
biotechnology, 1:500) and mouse anti-b-actin antibody.
After washing, membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated IgG secondary antibody in accordance with the origin of the primary antibody
for 1 h at room temperature. Then the antibody-reactive
bands were visualized on X-ray film using super ECL plus
detection reagent (Thermo, USA, 34077). The protein

Results

Statistical Analysis

GAS Reduced the Infarct Volume and Improved
the Neurobehavioral Score Induced by Cerebral
Ischemia

The software SPSS 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) was used to conduct statistical analyses. All
values, except for neurological scores, are presented as
mean ± SEM and analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and between-group differences were detected with
the post hoc Student–Newman–Keuls test. The neurological deficit scores were expressed as median (range) and
were analyzed with the Kruskal–Wallis test followed by
the Mann–Whitney U test with the Bonferroni correction.
Differences were considered significant when P \ 0.05.

To detect the neuroprotective effect of GAS, mice were
subjected to MCAO followed by GAS or vehicle treatment.
As shown in Fig. 1, at 24 h after reperfusion, significant
differences were found among groups in infarct volume
ratio and neurobehavioral score (P \ 0.01). Multiple
comparisons further showed that MCAO induced definite
infarct volume ratio and neurologic deficiency compared to
sham group. These changes were alleviated by GAS at
medium or high dose (P \ 0.05 compared to
MCAO ? Vehicle). Additionally, high dose of GAS was

more effective in alleviating ischemic brain injury for that
compared to MCAO ? GAS (L) group.
To detect if the neuroprotective effect of GAS was long
lasting but not transient, mice were subjected to MCAO
and then received GAS or vehicle once daily for 7 consecutive days. Infarct volume ratio and neurobehavioral
score was detected at 7 days after reperfusion. As shown in
Fig. 2, at 7 days after reperfusion, significant differences
among groups were found for both infarct volume and
neurobehavioral score (P \ 0.01). Multiple comparisons
showed that GAS at medium dose or high-dose alleviated
the neuronal damage induced by MCAO, high dose of GAS
was more potent in reducing cerebral damage induced by
ischemia [P \ 0.05 vs. MCAO ? GAS (L)]. These results
indicated that GAS dose-dependently reduced cerebral
ischemic injury in mice.

GAS Improved Morphology Damage and Inhibited
Apoptosis Pathway in the Ischemic Hemispheres
As shown in Fig. 3, at 24 h after reperfusion, there were
significant differences between each group in the percentage
of neuronal damage in the cortex and CA1 of hippocampus,
as well as the protein expression of cleaved Caspase 3, Bax
and Bcl-2. Post hoc comparisons further showed that MCAO
induced significant neuron damage both in the cortex and
CA1 hippocampus, increased the protein expression of
cleaved Caspase 3 and Bax, but decreased the expression of
Bcl-2 (P \ 0.05). These changes were alleviated by GAS at
medium dose or high-dose (P \ 0.05). High dose of GAS
further reduced the increase of Bax expression and inhibited
the reduction of Bcl-2 expression caused by MCAO compared to MCAO ? GAS (L) group.

expression of cleaved Caspase 3 (F4,20 = 6.796, P \ 0.01), Bax
(F4,20 = 16.676, P \ 0.01) and Bcl-2 (F4,20 = 7.681, P \ 0.01) 24 h
after reperfusion. *P \ 0.05, **P \ 0.01; #P \ 0.05 vs. MCAO ? GAS h group, &P \ 0.05 vs. MCAO ? vehicle group

As shown in Fig. 4, at 7 days after reperfusion, there were
significant differences among groups for the percentage of
injured neurons in the cortex and CA1 of hippocampus, as
well as the protein expression of cleaved Caspase 3, Bax and
Bcl-2. In accordance with the tendency of 24 h, Post hoc
comparisons showed that medium dose or high-dose of GAS
alleviated the neuronal damage induced by MCAO. Moreover, GAS at medium dose or high-dose inhibited the
expression of cleaved Caspase 3 and Bax and elevated the
expression of Bcl-2. Compared to MCAO ? GAS
(L) group, protein expression changes were more obvious in
MCAO ? GAS (H) group (P \ 0.05), indicating that a
larger dose of GAS was more effective in inhibiting proapoptotic protein expression and preserving anti-apoptotic
protein expression.
GAS Reversed MCAO-Induced Oxidative Damage
in the Ischemic Hemispheres
To evaluate the protective effect of GAS on the oxidative
damage in mice brain induced by MCAO, we determined
the protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
factor 2 (Nrf2), Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), SOD1,
phospho-Akt, total Akt as well as the content of MDA and
total cerebral SOD activity in the ischemic hemisphere at
6 h after reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 5, there were
significant differences among groups in the expression of
Nrf2, HO-1, SOD1 and phosphorylation level of Akt. The
expression of SOD1 and phosphorylation level of Akt
were significantly decreased after MCAO, which was dose
dependently reversed by the administration of GAS. In
addition, the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 were significantly also dose dependently increased by the administration of GAS.
There were also significant differences between each
group in the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA)
and activity of SOD. MCAO significantly increased the
concentrations of MDA (Fig. 5g), which was product of
lipid peroxidation, and the concentrations of MDA were

667

dose-dependently reduced by the administration of GAS. In
contrast, MCAO markedly decreased the activity of SOD
compared with that of sham group. Different doses of GAS
showed certain effect of increasing the activity of SOD
(Fig. 5h).
GAS Inhibited the Expression of Inflammatory
Cytokines in the Ischemic Hemispheres
To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of GAS in mice
brain after MCAO, we determined the protein expression
of TNF-a and IL-1b in the ischemic hemispheres at 6 h
after reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 6, there were significant
differences among groups in the expression of TNF-a and
IL-1b. The expression of TNF-a and IL-1b were significantly increased in MCAO ? Vehicle group, but this
increase was inhibited by medium and/or high dose of GAS
treatment.

Discussion
Ischemic pathogenesis is rapidly initiated within minutes
after the onset of MCAO, which involved a series of
subsequent biochemical events including oxidative stress,
inflammatory responses, programmed cell death, etc. [3,
34]. These events eventually lead to irreversible damage
of proteins, nucleic acids and cell organelles that cause
cellular dysfunction and neuronal death. The structure of
GAS is a phenol 4-Hydroxybenzyl alcohol 4-O-beta-Dglucopyranoside (C13H18O7) and its molecular weight is
286.28. It was found that GAS could bind with human
fibrinogen at the atomic level [35], and the entry of GAS
into the brain was rapid via the femoral vein administration [36]; Additionally, GAS could penetrate through
the blood–brain barrier into brain [37], we believe that it
could allow for peritoneal injection. Previous study indicated that pretreatment of GAS could decrease the glutamate/GABA ratio during ischemia and reperfusion [38],
and it could markedly decreased the infarct volume and
edema volume in MCAO rats at 24 h after reperfusion
[28, 39]. But whether this effect of GAS in neuroprotection is transient or permanent is still unknown. Also the
mechanism was not identified yet. As described in the
preciously studies, the definite infarct and iNOS expression in microglia were not detected until 24 h after
reperfusion [40], and the long lasting neuroprotective
effect could be observed 7 days after reperfusion [41, 42].
In the present study, we showed that GAS reduced the
infarct volume ratio from ischemia-induced injury when
administered one hour after MCAO. Besides, GAS treatment daily for 7 consecutive days showed long lasting

neuroprotective effects even at 7 days after reperfusion.
Since cerebral ischemia can induced both necrotic and
apoptotic cell death [43], the present study investigated
the cerebral damage in the primary somatosensory cortex
and CA1 of hippocampus, which were related to the
sensorimotor and memory deficits in the brain ischemia
[44–46], and the expression of cleaved Caspase 3, Bax
and Bcl-2 in the ischemic hemispheres as well. Caspase-3
can enzymatically digest specific substrates and inhibit
DNA repair enzymes, thus leading to breakage of the
chromosome into small fragments and eventual apoptosis.
Moreover, proteins in the Bcl-2 family are central to the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway, it is known that the proapoptotic protein Bax and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2
can migrate from the cytoplasm to mitochondria, which
are distributed in a manner that is consistent with mitochondrial release of cytochrome C and caspase [47]. The
results showed that GAS treatment presented a significant
functional recovery and morphology change and preserved
the expression of Bcl-2 protein and suppressed expression
of cleaved Caspase 3 and Bax induced by cerebral
ischemia at 24 h and 7 days after reperfusion. These data
provide direct evidence that GAS has a significant neuroprotective effect in cerebral ischemia.
We chose a transient cerebral ischemia model (1 h
MCAO) and didn’t test whether GAS has a neuroprotective effect against permanent cerebral ischemic injury in
the current study, mainly because GAS was reported to
have an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammation property,
which are two of the major characteristics for ischemicreperfusion injury in the brain. It has been reported that
several neuroprotective agents or strategies like dextromethorphan, riluzole, pioglitazone or HBO preconditioning are selectively effective only in transient ischemic
injury models but not permanent ischemic injury models
[48–50]. What’s more, the basic pathophysiological processes are in ways different between transient and

669

permanent cerebral ischemia including the pattern of
neurotoxic excitatory amino acid-glutamate release [51].
And the inflammatory response were more intense in
permanent ischemia models as described in previous
report that leukocyte infiltration was elevated at 24 h after
reperfusion but did not further increase in transient
ischemia model while permanent ischemia caused much
more infiltration T cells in the brain at 5 days after
ischemia [52]. In the current study, GAS significantly
inhibited inflammatory cytokine expression in the ischemic brain within 24 h after ischemia, which effectively
inhibited the acute inflammatory response in transient
cerebral ischemia and provided effective neuroprotection.
As a potent anti-inflammatory agent, repeated injection of
GAS after cerebral ischemia might provide neuroprotective effect for permanent cerebral ischemic injury in
animal models. But this effect and optimal dosage of GAS
administration needs to be explored.
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway
has been shown to play critical roles in the regulation of
cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, survival, and
intracellular trafficking. In addition, this pathway negatively regulates LPS-induced acute inflammatory responses [53, 54]. Furthermore, PI3-K/Akt signaling was
required for the activation of nuclear factor-erythroid
2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) [55], which is a major regulator
for several cytoprotective factors such as anti-oxidative
enzymes, anti-inflammatory factors and transcriptional
factors [56, 57]. Activation of the Nrf2 plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the endogenous defense mechanism by
which the brain protects itself against progressive ischemic damage and recovers from stroke [58, 59]. Moreover,
the activation of Nrf2 can coordinately up-regulate the
expression of several anti-oxidative enzymes such as
heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and superoxide dismutase1
(SOD1) [60, 61]. All of them were recognized to play
important roles in combating oxidative stress. Therefore,
therapies targeting the Akt/Nrf2 pathway have provided a
promising target for stroke treatment [62]. Previous
studies showed that GAS could inhibit NF-jB activation,
MAPKs phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory mediators
and pro-inflammatory cytokines production by activating
PI3-K/Akt pathway [63]. GAS could also up-regulate
gene expression of Nrf2 to protect primary cultured rat
hippocampal neurons against amyloid-beta peptideinduced neurotoxicity [27]. In addition, Studies have
revealed a therapeutic window of approximately 6 h
between the onset of ischemia and irreversible neuronal
death [64, 65]. Therefore, it is desirable that neuroprotective interventions should be attempted before stroke
occurs or very soon afterward.

To further elucidate the mechanism of GAS on alleviating MCAO-induced brain injury, the present study
investigated the effects of GAS on the amount of SOD
and MDA production, which is one of the classic oxidative stress markers to directly reflect the rate and extent of
lipid peroxidation. In addition, the protein expression of
phosphorylation level of Akt and Nrf2, as well as antioxidative enzymes (HO-1/SOD1) and pro-inflammatory
cytokines (TNF-a/IL-1b) to reveal the role of Akt and
Nrf2 signaling in the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory
effect of GAS after cerebral ischemic injury at 6 h after
reperfusion, which is based on the therapeutic window
that there are approximately 6 h between the onset of
ischemia and irreversible neuronal death [64, 65]. Our

findings showed that MDA production was decreased after
GAS treatment, as well as the expression of TNF-a and
IL-1b. However, the production and expression of HO-1
and SOD1 in the ischemic brain was increased by GAS
treatment. Furthermore, GAS significantly increased the
phosphorylation Akt and Nrf2 expression. These results
suggest that GAS regulates Akt phosphorylation and Nrf2
expression, thereby enhancing the protective defense
mechanisms through anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory
pathway.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that GAS had
neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic injury in
a mice MCAO model. Notably, we also found that neuroprotective effect of GAS was associated with the preservation of anti-oxidative enzymes and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines. This effect of GAS may be
intermediated by the activation of Akt/Nrf2 pathway.
These findings underscore GAS as a potential therapy for
the treatment of ischemic brain injury, and it would be a
useful agent when co-application to other drugs (such as
tPA). However, the involvement of Akt/Nrf2 in the neuroprotective effects of GAS and the mechanism of how
GAS affects the phosphorylation status of Akt and the
expression of Nrf2 needs to be further investigated. Further studies are needed to explore the detailed neurobiological and cellular mechanisms underlying GAS
treatment.
