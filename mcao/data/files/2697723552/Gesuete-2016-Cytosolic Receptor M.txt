Background and Purpose—Preconditioning with poly-l-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (ICLC) provides robust
neuroprotection from cerebral ischemia in a mouse stroke model. However, the receptor that mediates neuroprotection
is unknown. As a synthetic double-stranded RNA, poly-ICLC may bind endosomal Toll-like receptor 3 or one of the
cytosolic retinoic acid–inducible gene-I–like receptor family members, retinoic acid–inducible gene-I, or melanoma
differentiation–associated protein 5. Activation of these receptors culminates in type I interferons (IFN-α/β) induction—a
response required for poly-ICLC–induced neuroprotection. In this study, we investigate the receptor required for polyICLC–induced neuroprotection.
Methods—Toll-like receptor 3, melanoma differentiation–associated protein 5-, and IFN-promoter stimulator 1–deficient
mice were treated with poly-ICLC 24 hours before middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct volume was measured 24
hours after stroke to identify the receptor signaling pathways involved in protection. IFN-α/β induction was measured in
plasma samples collected 6 hours after poly-ICLC treatment. IFN-β–deficient mice were used to test the requirement of
IFN-β for poly-ICLC–induced neuroprotection. Mice were treated with recombinant IFN-α-A to test the role of IFN-α
as a potential mediator of neuroprotection.
Results—Poly-ICLC induction of both neuroprotection and systemic IFN-α/β requires the cytosolic receptor melanoma
differentiation–associated protein 5 and the adapter molecule IFN-promoter stimulator 1, whereas it is independent of
Toll-like receptor 3. IFN-β is not required for poly-ICLC–induced neuroprotection. IFN-α treatment protects against
stroke.
Conclusions—Poly-ICLC preconditioning is mediated by melanoma differentiation–associated protein 5 and its adaptor
molecule IFN-promoter stimulator 1. This is the first evidence that a cytosolic receptor can mediate neuroprotection,
providing a new target for the development of therapeutic agents to protect the brain from ischemic injury.

ore than 1 million patients annually are at risk of brain
ischemia and reperfusion injury that occurs secondary
to life-saving endovascular or cardiac procedures.1,2 To date,
no treatment is available to confer brain protection in this atrisk patient population. Prophylactic brain protection can be
achieved through preconditioning, a phenomenon whereby
brief exposure to a potential harmful stimulus induces protection against a subsequent injury. We have previously published that preconditioning with polyinosinic polycytidylic
acid stabilized with poly-l-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose
(poly-ICLC) protects against cerebral ischemic injury in a
mouse model of stroke resulting in reduced ischemic injury
and attenuation of stroke-induced neurological deficits.3 In

addition, we have shown that protection is dependent on type
I interferon (IFN) signaling.4 As a synthetic double-stranded
RNA, poly-ICLC may induce type I IFN signaling through the
binding and activation of multiple different pattern recognition receptor signaling cascades. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3),
retinoic acid–inducible gene-I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation–associated protein 5 (MDA5) have all been shown to
bind double-stranded RNA, making them potential targets for
poly-ICLC. Although TLR3 localizes to the endosome, RIG-I
and MDA5 are found in the cytoplasm.5 Identifying the specific receptor and intracellular signaling pathway engaged by
poly-ICLC is important for defining drug delivery strategies
for future translational development.

Gesuete et al   MDA5 Mediates Poly-ICLC Neuroprotection    263
In this study, we investigate the receptor-mediated signaling cascade required for poly-ICLC–induced neuroprotection
against ischemic brain injury using TLR3−/−, MDA5−/−, and
IFN-promoter stimulator (IPS)-1−/− mice. In addition, using
IFN-β–deficient mice, we show that IFN-β is not involved in
neuroprotection, and that exogenous administration of IFN-α
protects against stroke, supporting a role for IFN-α in mediating poly-ICLC–induced protection.

Mice

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

C57Bl/6 (wild-type [WT]), TLR3tm1Flv (TLR3−/−), and B6.Cg-Ifih1tm1.1Cln/J
(MDA5−/−) mice were from Jackson Laboratories (West Sacramento,
CA). IPS1−/− animals provided by Dr Edith Janssen (University of
Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH). IFN-β−/− mice provided by Dr Tomas
Leanderson (Lund University). Studies were performed with male
mice between 8 and 14 weeks of age. Mice were given free access to
food and water and housed in a facility approved by the Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
International. Animal protocols were approved by the Oregon Health
and Science University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(OWLAW A3304-01) and met the guidelines set forth by the National
Institutes of Health.

Study Design and Blinding
For each genotype (WT, TLR3−/−, MDA5−/−, IPS1−/−, and IFN-β−/−),
mice were randomly given a subcutaneous injection of either vehicle
(carboxymethyl cellulose; Sigma Aldrich) or poly-ICLC (Hiltonol;
60 μg per mouse; gifted from Oncovir, Washington, DC). For stroke
studies, mice were treated 24 hours before ischemia. To measure systemic type I IFN induction, mice were treated 6 hours before blood
collection. For studies involving IFN-α, mice were injected intraperitoneally with vehicle (saline) or recombinant IFN-α -A (1×104 U/
mouse; PBL Biomedical Laboratories) 18 hours before the surgery.
Surgery and analysis were performed by investigators blinded to

treatment and genotype. A total of 73 WT, 22 TLR3−/−, 25 MDA5−/−,
25 IPS1−/−, and 8 IFN-β−/− mice have been used in these studies.

Mouse Ischemia-Reperfusion Model
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 60- or 45-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as described previously.4 Mice that
did not show >80% reduction in cerebral blood flow, monitored with
laser Doppler flowmetry (Transonic System Inc.), were excluded.
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, infarct volume was measured as previously described.4

Cytokine Quantification
Plasma concentrations of IFN-α and IFN-β were determined using a Mouse IFN-α/IFN-β ProcartaPlex Multiplex Immunoassay
(Affymetrix eBioscience) according to manufacturer instructions.
Cytokine concentrations were extrapolated from the standard curve
with samples below the standard curve assigned a value half that of
the lowest standard.

Statistical Analysis
Data are represented as group mean±SEM and statistical analysis
performed using GraphPad Prism6 software. Two-way ANOVA with
Bonferroni post hoc test was used for infarct analysis and IFN-α/
IFN-β measurements.

Results
Poly-ICLC Requires MDA5, but Not TLR3, to
Induce Neuroprotection
Potential cognate receptors for poly-ICLC include TLR3, and
the RIG-I–like receptor family members, RIG-I and MDA5
(Figure 1A). RIG-I and MDA5 recognize double-stranded
RNA of different sizes,5 thus we postulated that poly-ICLC
(≈500 kDa) would bind to MDA5, which recognizes larger
double-stranded RNAs.6 To determine whether TLR3 or

MDA5 mediated poly-ICLC neuroprotection, TLR3−/−, and
MDA5−/− mice were preconditioned with poly-ICLC 24
hours before MCAO. As expected, poly-ICLC preconditioning significantly reduced ischemic injury in WT animals
(15.18±2.5% versus vehicle 32.57±1.8%; Figure 1B). In
addition, poly-ICLC preconditioning significantly reduced
ischemic injury in TLR3−/− mice (4.81±2.1% versus vehicle
29.14±4.1%; Figure 1B). No significant difference between
poly-ICLC–treated WT and TLR3−/− mice was evident. In
contrast, poly-ICLC–treated MDA5−/− mice failed to show
a reduction in ischemic volume (29.63±3.1% versus vehicle
32.1±1.8%; Figure 1B). These data indicate that poly-ICLC
preconditioning-induced neuroprotection is MDA5 dependent, demonstrating for the first time that a cytosolic receptor
can mediate neuroprotection.

Poly-ICLC–Induced Neuroprotection Is Mediated
Through IPS1
MDA5 signals through the adaptor molecule IFN-β-promoter
stimulator (IPS1) leading to the induction of type I IFNs5
(Figure 1A). Therefore, we tested the involvement of IPS1 in
poly-ICLC preconditioning using IPS1−/− mice. IPS1−/− mice
preconditioned with poly-ICLC failed to show a significant
reduction in ischemic injury (40.8±2.5% versus vehicle
37.11±2.0%; Figure 1B), demonstrating that poly-ICLC preconditioning depends on both MDA5 and IPS1 for the induction of neuroprotection.

Poly-ICLC Induction of Type I IFNs Requires
MDA5 and IPS1, Not TLR3
We have previously shown that poly-ICLC requires type I IFN
signaling for protection.4 Therefore, we postulate that MDA5
and IPS1 mediate poly-ICLC induction of IFN-α and/or

IFN-β. We measured plasma IFN-α and IFN-β levels 6 hours
after poly-ICLC treatment in WT, TLR3−/−, MDA5−/−, and
IPS1−/− mice. Poly-ICLC significantly increased plasma levels
of IFN-α in both WT and TLR3−/− mice (WT vehicle, 1.72
versus poly-ICLC, 596.37±181.8 pg/mL; TLR3−/− vehicle,
1.72 versus poly-ICLC, 720.88±371.8; Figure 2A). However,
MDA5−/− and IPS1−/− mice showed no significant induction of
IFN-α in response to poly-ICLC (Figure 2A). Similar results
were obtained for IFN-β (Figure 2B) with TLR3−/− and WT
mice inducing equivalent levels of IFN-β (WT, 33.17±14.2
versus TLR3−/−, 60.53±40.3 pg/mL; Figure 2B), whereas no
increase in IFN-β was detected in MDA5−/− and IPS1−/− mice.
These results are consistent with poly-ICLC–mediating protection through binding of the MDA5 receptor, signaling
through IPS1 and subsequent induction of type I IFNs, independent of TLR3 signaling.

IFN-β Is Not Required for Poly-ICLC
Neuroprotection
IFN-β has been shown to provide protection against cerebral
ischemic injury in experimental models of stroke,7–9 thus we
hypothesized that IFN-β may be the key mediator of neuroprotection. To test this, we preconditioned IFN-β−/− mice with
poly-ICLC 24 hours before ischemia. We found that IFNβ−/− mice were significantly protected against ischemic brain
injury (poly-ICLC, 21.54±5.3% versus vehicle, 41.91±5.8%;
Figure 3A), indicating that poly-ICLC–induced neuroprotection is independent of IFN-β.

Systemic IFN-α Protects Against Stroke
The previous data indicate that IFN-β is not required, indicating that another type I IFN receptor ligand, such as IFN-α,
may mediate the protective response. To test this, IFN-α was
administered 18 hours before MCAO. This timing corresponds
Figure 3. Poly-l-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose
(ICLC) neuroprotection is independent of interferon
(IFN)-β, whereas IFN-α treatment confers protection
against stroke. A, IFN-β−/− mice were administered
poly-ICLC (60 μg) or vehicle 1 d before middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 60 min), and
ischemic injury was measured 24 h after MCAO.
B, Mice were administered recombinant IFN-α
(1×104 U/mouse) or vehicle 18 h before MCAO (45
min), and ischemic injury was measured 24 h after

with the increase in serum levels of IFN-α induced by preconditioning with poly-ICLC. We found that IFN-α–treated mice
showed a significant reduction in ischemic volume (IFN-α,

protection against stroke.

among pattern recognition receptors for conferring protection
against brain ischemic injury. This discovery has real significance in neuroprotection because it broadens substantially the
possibilities of new approaches to achieve neuroprotection,
particularly in the realm of preconditioning modalities.

Discussion

Our results demonstrate that cytoplasmic receptors play an
important role in preconditioning, and that MDA5 and its
adapter IPS1 are required for poly-ICLC–induced neuroprotection. These findings increase our understanding of the
neuroprotective mechanisms associated with poly-ICLC, furthering its development as a prophylactic treatment against
ischemic injury. Furthermore, the results reported here expand
our knowledge of potential endogenous targets for the development of new therapeutic agents for stroke.

We demonstrate that poly-ICLC preconditioning mediates
neuroprotection through the cytoplasmic receptor MDA5
and its adapter IPS1. We have previously published that the
type I IFN receptor is required for protection.4 Here we show
that, although systemic levels of both IFN-α and IFN-β are
increased in response to poly-ICLC preconditioning, the protective response is independent of IFN-βwhereas direct treatment with IFN-α protects the brain from ischemic injury,
supporting a key role for IFN-α in poly-ICLC neuroprotection.
These findings broaden our knowledge of endogenous targets
for the induction of neuroprotection against cerebral ischemic
injury. In particular, the localization of these mediators of
protection (both the receptor and its adapter molecule) in the
cytoplasm may offer alternative drug delivery strategies for the
translational development of therapeutic agents for stroke.
We found that neuroprotection induced by poly-ICLC preconditioning is mediated exclusively through MDA5 and independent of TLR3. This is in contrast to a recent study using
native poly-IC in which acute neuroprotection against brain
ischemic injury was mediated through TLR3.10 The apparent
difference may relate to the chemical modification of polyICLC, which is a version of poly-IC that has been stabilized
with poly-l-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose to improve
pharmacokinetics. These alterations may influence the structure
and trafficking of the compound resulting in different responses
between poly-ICLC and native poly-IC. Consistent with this
postulate, we found that although poly-ICLC was able to induce
IFN-α and β in TLR3−/− mice (Figure 2), poly-IC was unable to
induce either IFN in the TLR3−/− mice (data not shown). This
difference is likely the result of altered trafficking of the 2 polyIC compounds into the cell. This is supported by recent data by
Dann et al11 demonstrating that native (noncomplexed) poly-IC
is a ligand for TLR3, whereas poly-IC in complex with polyethylenimine targets the cytoplasmic receptor MDA5.12 Poly-IC
complexation with polyethylenimine changes its cell delivery
making it available for the cytosolic receptors. We propose that
the LC component of poly-ICLC modifies the cell delivery as
well, making poly-ICLC a specific ligand for cytosolic MDA5.
The association between stimulation of RIG-I–like receptors and reduction of central nervous system inflammation
was previously reported by Dann et al,11 who showed that activation of RIG-I and MDA5 reduced macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration into the spinal cord in an experimental model
of multiple sclerosis. Similar to our results, this process was
dependent on type I IFN receptor signaling.4,11
We and others have shown that prophylactic administration of TLR ligands induces neuroprotection against MCAO in
mice.13 Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the pattern
recognition receptor, MDA5, is involved in neuroprotection.
This may indicate the existence of a conserved feature shared
