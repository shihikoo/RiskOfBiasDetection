Ischemic stroke is one of the most common cerebrovascular and
neurological diseases leading to significant lifelong morbidity and
mortality. Post-stroke angiogenesis formed by new capillaries is a
key event of neurovascular remodeling processes for supply of
nutrition and oxygen into injury area. Endothelial progenitor cells
(EPC) is found to be involved in post-stroke angiogenesis, which
decreases stroke size and improves behavioral outcomes [1,2].
Therefore, several clinical trials evaluating angiogenesis by EPC in
treating ischemic stroke are underway [1].
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a ubiquitous biological molecule that participates in numerous cellular biological
reactions, and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)
is the rate-limiting enzyme for mammalian NAD salvage synthesis
[3]. We and other groups have showed that neuronal NAMPT is
upregulated [4] and released [5] after cerebral ischemia. The
inducible NAMPT by cerebral ischemia displays potent neuroprotection in rodent ischemic stroke models [4–6]. Recently, we demonstrated that intracellular NAMPT improves hind-limb vascular
repair by modulating Notch signaling pathway in EPC [7]. Overexpression of NAMPT increases deacetylation of Notch-1 intracellular domain, which inhibits delta-like ligand-4-Notch signaling
and thereby upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor receptors in EPC [7]. This pro-angiogenesis action of NAMPT in hindlimb raises the possibility that NAMPT may promote post-stroke
angiogenesis. However, it should be noted that there exists much
difference between skeletal muscle tissue and central nerve system (CNS), which might affect the action of NAMPT in brain
angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia.
To test this hypothesis, we subjected two transgenic mice
stains (NAMPT-transgenic and H247A dominant negative

NAMPT-transgenic mice, which are referred as NAMPT-Tg and
DN-NAMPT-Tg respectively) [7] with middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO), a widely used cerebral ischemia model. The
cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ischemic brain area was measured
using Laser Doppler Monitoring. As shown in Figure 1, the CBF
declined markedly (~20% of control) after MCAO. During the
two weeks post ischemia, the CBF gradually recovered (from
~20% to ~40% of control), suggesting a naturally occurred
angiogenesis process. Compared with WT mice, NAMPT-Tg mice
exhibited significantly increased CBF recovery at 7th day and
14th day but not at 3rd day post MCAO. In contrast, such

time-points (before MCAO, after MCAO, 3rd days post MCAO, 7th days
post MCAO and 14th days post MCAO) was measured using Laser
Doppler monitoring. The CBF in the contralateral side is deemed to be
normal. **P < 0.01 versus WT by one-way ANOVA. n = 8 per group.

Figure 2 Representative images and quantitative analysis of post-stroke angiogenesis in mouse brain penumbra tissue at 14th days after MCAO. (A) Brain
penumbra tissue was fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde and cut into 20 lM sections, which were stained by Alexa 488-conjugated IB4-lectin (Sigma) and
mouse monoclonal anti-Ki-67 (BD Biosciences). Then, sections were stained by corresponding goat anti mouse Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody and
DAPI (nuclei marker). The images were captured by FV1000 (Olympus) laser scanning confocal microscopes. (B) Quantitative analysis of the number of

phenotype was not observed in DN-NAMPT-Tg mice. The CBF
recovery in DN-NAMPT-Tg mice was even lower than that in
WT mice, although there was no significance.
We also determined the cerebral angiogenesis in these three
stains using immunohistochemistry. Brain sections were stained
by double-label immunohistochemistry at 14th day after MCAO.
IB4-lectin was applied to stain blood vessels and anti-Ki-67 was
applied to stain proliferative cells. The IB4-lectin/Ki-67 doublepositive (IB4-lectin+/Ki-67+) cells were thought to be
new-formed blood vessels, which reflects the post-ischemic
angiogenesis. As shown in Figure 2, the number of IB4-lectin+/
Ki-67+ cells in brain sections of NAMPT-Tg mice was more than
that in WT mice. However, this change was not observed in DNNAMPT-Tg mice.
The integrity of neurovascular unit plays critical roles in ischemic stroke as well as many other CNS disorders [8]. The neurovascular unit involves microvessels, pericytes, astrocytes, neurons,
axons, and other supporting cells such as microglia [8]. The
increased supply of nutrition and oxygen resulted by post-stroke
angiogenesis undoubtedly contributes to restoration of neurological functions. Recently, some circulating angiogenic factors, such
as adiponectin and angiopoietin-1, were reported to improve neurobehavioral outcomes after focal cerebral ischemia [9,10]. Our
results support the notion that NAMPT improves post-stroke
angiogenesis. Because neuronal NAMPT is upregulated and
released after ischemia [4,5], we propose that the upregulation of
NAMPT may be a beneficial response against ischemic stress.
NAMPT may be not only a neuroprotector, but also a promoter
for post-stroke angiogenesis: on the one hand, the NAMPT

upregulation helps to protect neurons from ischemic-induced
acute death; on the other hand, the NAMPT upregulation may
increase the formation of new capillaries via improving postischemic angiogenesis during the subacute and chronic periods.
The presence of proliferating vascular endothelial cells and
enlarged and thin-walled vessels, termed “mother” vessels, is a
marker of cerebral ischemic angiogenesis. When ischemia occurs,
EPC were motivated and recruited to ischemic area. Finally, EPCs
were incorporated into neovessels to induce post-ischemic angiogenesis and neurogenesis [1,2]. We propose that the molecular
mechanisms underlying the promoting effect of NAMPT on angiogenesis may attribute to its regulation of EPC. Previously, we have
demonstrated that NAMPT overexpression improved blood flow
recovery and augmented collateral arterioles in the ischemic limb
by promoting EPCs [7]. This biological function of NAMPT could
also work upon brain ischemia and thereby improves EPCs
recruitment and enhances EPCs incorporation into cerebral arterioles. All these might lead to improvement of angiogenesis and
neurogenesis.
In summary, the results of this study demonstrate that NAMPT
facilitates post-stroke angiogenesis and represents a promising
therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.
