To test whether resveratrol provides beneﬁts via estrogen receptors (ERs) in the blood-brain barrier of
estrogen-deﬁcient females, ovariectomized mice were treated with resveratrol then were subjected to
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Compared with vehicle treatment, resveratrol
reduced infarct volume and neurologic deﬁcits after MCAO. Basal tight junction (TJ) protein levels in the
brain were increased by resveratrol. After MCAO, blood-brain barrier breakdown reduced levels of TJ
proteins, and induction of HIF-1a and VEGF were attenuated by resveratrol. These effects were reversed
by the ERs antagonist, ICI182,780. In mouse brain, endothelial cells (bEnd.3) exposed to hypoxia,
resveratrol treatment protected the cells against cytotoxicity, increases of paracellular permeability and
changes in levels of TJ protein and HIF-1a/VEGF proteins. These effects were reversed by ICI182,780 but
not by speciﬁc ERa or ERb antagonists, indicating nonspeciﬁc ER mediated effects. Altogether, these
results showed that neuroprotective effects of resveratrol in ovariectomized mice were mediated by ERs
and associated with tightening of blood-brain barrier, suggesting that resveratrol can be an alternative to
estrogens to protect the brains of estrogen-deﬁcient females against ischemic insult.

1. Introduction
Epidemiologic studies have shown that the incidence of stroke is
lower in women during their reproductive years, but after menopause, stroke occurs more often in women than men of comparable
age (Haast et al., 2012). These studies imply that endogenous estrogen is responsible for the resistance of female brains to ischemic
stroke. From early observational studies of hormone replacement
therapy and several rodent models of ischemic stroke, it was suggested that exogenous estrogen administration provides neuroprotection in postmenopausal women (Behl, 2002). However, there
are concerns about exogenous estrogen use because the Women’s
Health Initiative reported increased risks of coronary heart disease
and ischemic stroke in women with hormone replacement therapy
(Rossouw et al., 2002). As the postmenopausal period for women
has come to be longer because of increased longevity, the risk of
degenerative brain diseases is becoming an important issue for
estrogen-deﬁcient aged women. The discovery of safe estrogen

substitutes is crucial for preventing or ameliorating brain diseases
in postmenopausal women.
Resveratrol, a polyphenolic phytoestrogen found in grapes and
wine, has protective effects against neurodegenerative diseases and
ischemic insults in animal models (Sun et al., 2010). As resveratrol
binds to estrogen receptors (ERs) and activate gene transcription,
ERs mediate some of resveratrol’s actions in the brain (Di Liberto
et al., 2012; Saleh et al., 2010; Singh et al., 2007). Therefore, we
postulate that resveratrol could be a potential alternative to estrogen for prevention of brain damage against ischemic stroke in
estrogen-deﬁcient females.
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) maintenance is important for brain
homeostasis and function; thus, dysregulated BBB permeability is
implicated in many brain diseases (Stanimirovic and Satoh, 2000).
Transmembrane tight junction (TJ) proteins are components of BBB
and regulate paracellular permeability between adjacent endothelial cells (Coisne and Engelhardt, 2011). Because reduced TJ protein
levels results in BBB breakdown and brain edema (Jiao et al., 2011;
Yang et al., 2007), their changes in protein levels are associated
with the development and progression of brain diseases. In addition,
age-dependent BBB dysfunctions and alteration of TJ integrity in the
absence of disease have been demonstrated (Bake et al., 2009; Farrall
and Wardlaw, 2009; Hafezi-Moghadam et al., 2007), implying that

aged brains are susceptible to develop brain diseases. Recently, it has
been reported that resveratrol protects brain endothelial cells
against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Lin et al., 2010), recurrent
ischemic stroke (Clark et al., 2012), and mutations in the palmitoylprotein thioesterase-1 (Ppt1) gene (Saha et al., 2012), and its effects
are associated with prevention of reduction of TJ protein levels
induced by such insults (Lin et al., 2010; Saha et al., 2012). These
results suggest that resveratrol provides BBB protection via modulation of TJ protein level against noxious stimuli.
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of
resveratrol on ischemic brain injury in female ovariectomized (OVX)
mice, a postmenopausal model, and whether its effects are mediated
by ERs. Then, to characterize the effects of resveratrol with respect to
BBB permeability, changes in TJ protein levels were evaluated in the
brain of OVX mice. In addition, we examined the effects of resveratrol
on in vitro brain endothelial cells before and after insults.
2. Methods
2.1. Experimental animals
Female C57BL/6 mice, aged 10e11 weeks, were used (Orient Bio
Inc, Seongnam, Republic of Korea). All procedures were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Medical
School of Ewha Womans University and conformed to international
guidelines for the ethical use of experimental animals. The number
of animals used was minimized to reduce animal suffering.
2.2. Ovariectomy and drug administration
Two weeks before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),
female mice were subjected to aseptic bilateral surgical ovariectomy via a dorsal incision under anesthesia. In the ﬁrst part, OVX
mice were divided randomly into vehicle and resveratrol treatment
groups. The dose of resveratrol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
was determined as 0.1 mg/kg to minimize systemic effects of
ethanol in the vehicle because of its poor solubility in water. The
ﬁnal concentration of ethanol in distilled water (0.1 mL) was 0.2%
(vol/vol). Vehicle or resveratrol was administered orally by gavage
for 10 days starting 7 days before MCAO. In the second part of the
experiments, resveratrol-treated OVX mice were divided randomly
into sesame oil (0.1 mL per mouse) and the pure nuclear ER
antagonist ICI182,780 (100 mg in 0.1 mL of sesame oil; Tocris Biosciences, Bristol, UK) treatment groups. Sesame oil or ICI182,780
was given to resveratrol-treated mice subcutaneously for 10 days
starting 7 days before MCAO. The dose of ICI182,780 was based on
the previous study (Shin et al., 2011). To measure estrogen activity,
plasma estradiol levels were measured with an ELISA assay kit
(Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and uterine weight was
assessed as a biological assay of peripheral ER activation.
2.3. Transient MCAO
Procedures for transient MCAO and cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF)
monitoring were previously described (Shin et al., 2010). After
30 minutes MCAO, only animals that exhibited a greater than 85%
reduction in CBF during MCAO that recovered by more than 80% after
10 minutes of reperfusion were included. Rectal temperature was
maintained at 37.0  C  0.5  C during surgery and recovery until mice
regained consciousness. Control animals did not undergo surgery.
2.4. Behavioral tests
Neurologic scores and performance in the wire suspension test
were examined before and 3 days after MCAO. A 4-point graded

scoring system for neurologic scores and a 5-point graded scoring
system for the wire suspension test were used (Shin et al., 2013a).
2.5. Measurements of infarct volume
Three days after MCAO, brains of mice were removed, frozen,
and sectioned (30 mm thick) with a cryostat. Serially collected brain
sections (600-mm intervals) were stained with cresyl violet.
Infarction volume was determined using an image analyzer (Axiovision LE 4.1, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Values were reported after
correction for postischemic swelling as previously described (Shin
et al., 2010).
2.6. IgG extravasation and Western blot analysis
To measure BBB permeability, IgG extravasation was examined
in the ipsilateral cortex 6 hours after MCAO as described previously
(Shin et al., 2013b). Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) loaded with 50 mg of protein were
incubated overnight with primary antibody against biotinylated
anti-mouse IgG (1:250; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA),
and then incubated with an avidin peroxidase kit (Vectastain Elite;
Vector Laboratories) for 1 hour. For quantiﬁcation, total chain
densities (heavy chain þ light chain) of each protein were
normalized to the density of actin (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) bands on corresponding blots using
the Image J 1.37v program (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD, USA).
Cortical tissues from each hemisphere and cultured brain endothelial cells were used for Western blotting. Protein was isolated
from cells and tissues, and 80 mg of protein for brain tissue and 50 mg
for bEnd.3 cells were loaded, electrophresed, and transferred to
Immobilon-P membranes as previously described (Shin et al.,
2013b). Membranes were incubated overnight with antibodies
against occludin (1:1000; Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA,
USA), claudin-5 (1:1000; Invitrogen Corporation), VEGF (1:500;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HIF-1a (1:500; BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA, USA), ERa (1:500), ERb (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or
actin (1:1000). After 1 hour incubation with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies, protein bands were visualized
with Western Blotting Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
For quantiﬁcation, densities of each band were normalized to the
density of actin using the Image J 1.37v program.
2.7. Cell culture and treatments
Immortalized mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd.3) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured on
60 mm dishes (for Western blotting), 24-well plates (for cytotoxicity assay and immunoﬂuorescence staining), 96-well plates (for
cell viability assay), Transwell-membrane inserts (for paracelluar
permeability) or Millicell cell culture inserts in 12-well plates
(for TEER assay, Millipore Corporation) at a seeding density of
5.0  104e5.0  105 cells per well. Cells were maintained in Dulbeccos Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (ATCC) at 37  C in a humidiﬁed
incubator under 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cobalt chloride (CoCl2,
50e200 mM; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan) dissolved in
phosphate-buffered saline and resveratrol (10e1000 nM) in
ethanol and ICI182,780 (0.1e10 mM), 1,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4methyl-5-[4-(2-piperidinylethoxy)phenol]-1H-pyrazole
(MPP,
1 mM; Tocris Biosciences) and 4-[2-phenyl-5,7-bis(triﬂuoromethyl)
pyrazolo[1.5-a]pyrimidine-3-yl]phenol (PHTPP, 1 mM; Tocris Biosciences) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added to cultures. For
cotreatment, resveratrol was added to cells 48 hours before CoCl2
exposure, and ICI182,780, MPP, or PHTPP was added 1 hour before

J.A. Shin et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 36 (2015) 993e1006

resveratrol treatment. The ﬁnal concentration of ethanol and DMSO
was 0.1% (vol/vol); each targeted concentration of reagents was
diluted 1:1000 from stock solution. Cells without CoCl2 exposure
were used as control cells.
2.8. Cell viability and cytotoxicity measurements
Cell viability was determined by the mitochondrial-dependent
reduction of MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) to formazan by adding the 10 mL of MTT agent
(5 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) to cells in the plates. Optical density of
the plates was measured by spectrometer, and the difference in
optical density relative to untreated controls was taken as a measure of cell viability. To measure cell death and cell lysis, lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in cell culture media was measured
with a commercially available kit (Cytotoxicity Detection KitPLUS
(LDH); Roche, Mannheim, Germany).
2.9. Paracellular permeability assay
The paracellular permeability assay using a cell culture insert
system was performed as described previously (Andriopoulou et al.,
1999). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (5 mg/mL, 100 mL;
average molecular mass 40 kDa; Sigma-Aldrich) was added into the
upper compartment followed by addition of CoCl2 (150 mM), with or
without resveratrol (100 nM) pretreatment for 48 hours before
CoCl2 exposure. The same amount of medium (50 mL) was taken
from the lower compartment, and ﬂuorescence intensity was
measured by a spectrometer.
2.10. Measurement of transendothelial electrical resistance
Transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured
across the monolayers grown on the insert using a Millicell Electrical Resistance System-2 device and chopstick-style electrodes
(STX01; Millipore Corporation) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The values are shown as U cm2 based on the culture
inserts.

3. Results
3.1. ER-mediated resveratrol effects in OVX mice after MCAO
To examine neuroprotective effects of resveratrol in OVX mice,
infarct volume and behavioral tests were analyzed 3 days after
MCAO. Resveratrol signiﬁcantly decreased total infarct volumes
(29.66  4.95 mm3, 0.46-fold change) compared with vehicle
(63.90  3.69 mm3, p < 0.01; Fig. 1A and B). The reduction was
prominent in the cortex (45.44  2.71 mm3 vs. 16.41  5.73 mm3;
0.36-fold change, p < 0.01) but not in the striatum (p ¼ 0.45). No
differences in CBF were found between vehicle and resveratrol
groups (Fig. 1A). In behavioral tests, there were no differences in
performance among treatment groups before MCAO, but 3 days
after MCAO, resveratrol pretreated mice showed signiﬁcant improvements in motor performance compared with the vehicle
treatment group (p ¼ 0.02 for neurologic score, p < 0.01 for wire
suspension test; Fig. 1C and D). Body weights between vehicle and
resveratrol treatment groups were not different before (20.85 
0.49 g vs. 20.47  0.24 g) and after MCAO (16.70  0.48 g vs. 16.83 
0.54 g). Serum estradiol levels were not different between treatments, and uterine weights were not affected by resveratrol
(Table 1). These results suggest that resveratrol reduces brain injury
and neurologic deﬁcits after ischemic insult in OVX mice without
affecting peripheral estrogen-sensitive tissues.
Next, to test role of ERs in the resveratrol effects against MCAO,
sesame oil or an ERs antagonist ICI182,780 was administered to
mice pretreated with resveratrol. Sesame oil did not affect resveratrol effects on infarct volumes, but ICI182,780 reversed the
reduction of total and cortical infarct volumes afforded by resveratrol (Fig. 1E and F). In addition, behavioral outcomes in mice
treated with both resveratrol and ICI182,780 were worse after
MCAO compared with the resveratrol-sesame oil treated group
(total, 57.40  3.97 mm3, 1.74-fold change; cortex, 39.34 
3.09 mm3, 1.78-fold change; both p < 0.01 vs. resveratrol with
sesame oil, Fig. 1G and H). CBF changes during MCAO and reperfusion and motor performance of mice before MCAO between
treatments were not different (Fig. 1E, G and H). These results
suggest that the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol against
ischemic brain insults in OVX mice are mediated by ERs.

2.11. Double immunoﬂuorescence staining
Cells were ﬁxed with cold methanol: acetone (1:1) for 20 minutes at 20  C. After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% triton X-100% and 0.1% BSA for 1 hour, cells were
coincubated with the primary antibodies against claudin-5 or
occludin (1:250; Invitrogen Corporation) with CD31 (1:100; BD
Biosciences) at 4  C overnight. Secondary antibodies conjugated to
Alexa ﬂuor555 (1:1000; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) and
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (1:1000; Vector Laboratories) were
applied to cells for 1 hour. The cells were mounted with Vectashield
mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) after washing. Fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal microscope (LSM5
PASCAL; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
2.12. Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean  standard error of the mean.
Comparisons between 2 groups were analyzed using unpaired
Student t tests, and comparisons among more than 2 groups were
analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc
Fisher protected least signiﬁcant difference tests. Neurologic and
wire suspension test scores were analyzed using Mann-Whitney Utests (Prism6, GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA). Statistical
signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05.

3.2. Resveratrol reduces BBB breakdown and decrease of TJ protein
levels via ERs in the ischemic brain
To determine whether the neuroprotective effects of resveratrol
were associated with BBB breakdown in the ischemic brain, IgG
extravasation was measured in the ipsilateral cortex 6 hours after
MCAO, the time point previously shown with signiﬁcant extravasation of IgG after MCAO (Shin et al., 2013b). Compared with
vehicle, IgG extravasation was signiﬁcantly reduced by resveratrol
(0.74-fold change, p < 0.01; Fig. 2A), indicating less BBB breakdown.
Decreased expression of TJ proteins is closely associated with BBB
breakdown and edema in the ischemic brain (Jiao et al., 2011; Yang
et al., 2007). Therefore, protein levels of claudin-5 and occludin, 2
major proteins of TJs, were examined in the right cortex of mice
pretreated with resveratrol before and after MCAO. Before MCAO,
levels of claudin-5 (1.31-fold change) and occludin (1.30-fold
change) were signiﬁcantly increased in the cortex of mice treated
with resveratrol compared with vehicle (both p < 0.01; Fig. 2B).
After MCAO, both protein levels were signiﬁcantly decreased in
vehicle-treated mice at 24 hours compared with control (0.76-fold
change for claudin-5; 0.67-fold change for occludin, both p ¼ 0.02;
Fig. 2C), but their expression was well maintained by resveratrol
(Fig. 2D). When ICI182,780 was administered with resveratrol, IgG
extravasation at 6 hours after MCAO was markedly increased

compared with sesame oil (1.34-fold change, p < 0.01; Fig. 3A).
ICI182,780 reversed the increased of TJ protein levels induced by
resveratrol in the brain before MCAO (0.70-fold change for claudin5; 0.79-fold change for occludin, both p < 0.01; Fig. 3B). Also, after
MCAO, levels of both TJ proteins were signiﬁcantly decreased by

ICI182,780 at 24 hours compared with control (both proteins, p <
0.05; Fig. 3C), similar to those of vehicle only treatment (as shown
Fig. 2C). HIF-1a and VEGF involve in alteration of TJ protein
levels (Argaw et al., 2009; Yan et al., 2012), and their expression
is modulated by ERs after ischemic injury (Shin et al., 2013b).

Key: MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion; OVX, ovariectomized; SEM, standard
error of the mean.

To determine whether resveratrol affected expression of HIF-1a and
VEGF protein after ischemic insult, their levels were examined in
the ipsilateral cortex 24 hours after MCAO. MCAO-induced increases of HIF-1a and VEGF protein in vehicle-treated brain were
signiﬁcantly decreased by resveratrol (0.76-fold and 0.65-fold
change, respectively, both p < 0.01), and these decreases were
reversed by ICI182,780 (both proteins p < 0.05 vs. resveratrol;
Fig. 3D). The modes of action of ICI182,780 include prevention of ER
homodimerization and nuclear localization of ERs, and reduction of
cellular levels of ERs (Howell, 2006). To test whether ER protein
levels were affected by ICI182,780, ERa and ERb protein levels were
measured. The expression of both ERa and ERb in the ischemic
brains was decreased only in mice treated with ICI182,780 (both
proteins p < 0.01 vs. vehicle and resveratrol; Fig. 3E), indicating the
antagonistic action of ICI182,780 on ERs by reduction of their protein levels. Altogether, these results suggest that resveratrol reduces
BBB breakdown by preventing the increase in HIF-1a/VEGF and
decrease in TJ protein levels of the ischemic brain, and these actions
are ERs dependent.

3.3. Hypoxic effects in brain endothelial cells
We next investigated the direct effects of resveratrol on brain
endothelial cells. We used bEnd.3 cells as an in vitro BBB model in
terms of expression of TJ proteins and paracellular permeability to
dextran. Cells were exposed to different concentrations of a hypoxia
mimetic agent CoCl2 (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mM) for 72 hours, and
then MTT and LDH assays were performed. Cell viability was
signiﬁcantly decreased at 150 mM (52.74%  2.52%) and 200 mM
CoCl2 (39.58%  7.77%) compared with control cells (both p < 0.01;
Fig. 4A). LDH assay also showed cytotoxicity at 150 mM (11.10% 
0.19%; p ¼ 0.04) and 200 mM CoCl2 (28.75%  7.02%; p < 0.01)
compared with control cells (Fig. 4B). From these results, 150 mM of
CoCl2 was used to induce hypoxic insult in bEnd.3 cells in subsequent experiments.
To test the effect of CoCl2 on paracellular permeability, the
amount of FITC-dextran ﬂux was measured according to the duration of CoCl2 exposure. FITC-dextran ﬂux increased in an exposuretime dependent manner, and the increase was signiﬁcant 48 hours
(1.19-fold change, p ¼ 0.04) and 72 hours (1.39-fold change, p <
0.01) exposure to CoCl2 compared with corresponding control cells
(Fig. 4C). Changes in TJ protein levels in cells were examined to
determine whether their levels correlated with paracellular
permeability. Although TJ protein levels in control cells were unchanged for 48 hours and decreased only 72 hours after culturing in
normal medium (both proteins p < 0.05 vs. 0 hours; Fig. 4D),
claudin-5 started to decrease beginning at 6 hours (0.77-fold
change, p < 0.01 vs. 0 hours) and occludin started to decrease
beginning at 24 hours (0.70-fold change, p < 0.01 vs. 0 hours) in
cells exposed to CoCl2 (Fig. 4E). As CoCl2 is known to induce HIF-1a
and VEGF (Engelhardt et al., 2014), our results also revealed that
CoCl2 signiﬁcantly induced expression of HIF-1a from 6 hours (1.95fold change, p < 0.01 vs. 0 hours) and VEGF from 24 hours (1.39-fold

997

change, p ¼ 0.03 vs. 0 hours; Fig. 4F). These results indicate that
cytotoxic hypoxic insult to brain endothelial cells induces increased
paracellular permeability in conjunction with reduction of TJ protein levels and induction of HIF-1a/VEGF protein expression.
3.4. Resveratrol attenuates hypoxic effects in brain endothelial cells
To examine whether resveratrol increased TJ protein levels in
brain endothelial cells as shown in in vivo study, their levels were
measured at various concentrations of resveratrol for 48 hours.
Both claudin-5 (1.45-fold change, p ¼ 0.01) and occludin (1.28-fold
change, p ¼ 0.03) were signiﬁcantly increased by 100 nM of
resveratrol compared with control cells (Fig. 5A). Vehicle alone did
not affect TJ protein levels (Fig. 5A). These in vitro data support the
ﬁnding that resveratrol increased TJ protein levels in the brain of
OVX mice. Therefore, the dose of 100 nM resveratrol was used in the
following experiments to test the protective effects of resveratrol
against hypoxic insult in bEnd.3 cells. Resveratrol was added for
48 hours then followed by treatment with CoCl2 for 24, 48, and
72 hours to match the in vivo treatment paradigm. Cell viability was
increased, whereas cytotoxicity was reduced by resveratrol in
bEnd.3 cells exposed to CoCl2 at 48 hours (1.10-fold change for MTT
assay; 0.46-fold change for LDH assay, both p < 0.05 vs. CoCl2) and
72 hours (1.72-fold change for MTT assay; 0.56-fold change for LDH
assay, both p < 0.01 vs. CoCl2; Fig. 5B and C). Similarly, resveratrol
prevented the increase of paracellular permeability induced by
CoCl2 at 48 hours (0.86-fold change, p ¼ 0.03 vs. CoCl2) and
72 hours (0.74-fold change, p < 0.01 vs. CoCl2; Fig. 5D). Reduction of
TJ protein levels by CoCl2 was observed only at 72 hours in
resveratrol-treated bEnd.3 cells (0.78-fold change for claudin-5;
0.87-fold change for occludin, both p < 0.05 vs. 0 hours; Fig. 5E),
and these reduction were much less than those in cells exposed to
only CoCl2 (as shown Fig. 4E), suggesting that resveratrol protects TJ
protein levels against hypoxia. When HIF-1a and VEGF protein
levels were measured at 24 hours, the time point shown to induce
their expression by CoCl2 (Fig. 4F), resveratrol prevented the increase of both proteins in bEnd.3 cells exposed to CoCl2 (0.64-fold
change for HIF-1a; 0.58-fold change for VEGF, both p < 0.05;
Fig. 5F). Altogether, these results suggest that resveratrol protects
brain endothelial cells against hypoxic insult and reduces paracellular permeability by inhibiting HIF-1a/VEGF signaling, which
protects TJ protein levels.
3.5. ER-mediated protective effects of resveratrol against hypoxic
insult in brain endothelial cells
ERs are expressed in bEnd.3 cells (Guo et al., 2010). To evaluate
whether ERs are involved in the protective effects of resveratrol
against hypoxia, ICI182,780 at different concentrations (0.1, 1, or
10 mM) was added to bEnd.3 cells for 1 hour followed by the addition
of resveratrol for 48 hours. The resveratrol-induced increase of TJ
protein levels was reversed by ICI182,780 at both 1 mM (0.77-fold
change for claudin-5; 0.81-fold change for occludin, both p < 0.05)
and 10 mM concentrations (0.78-fold change for claudin-5; 0.77-fold
change for occludin, both p < 0.05) compared with DMSO (vehicle
for ICI182,780; Fig. 6A). Subsequently, ICI182,780 at 1 mM concentration was used to test ER-mediated effects of resveratrol against
CoCl2. Because resveratrol protected bEnd.3 cells from 48 hours
CoCl2 exposure (Fig. 5B and C), MTT and LDH assays measured at
48 hours CoCl2 exposure. ICI182,780 reversed protective effects of
resveratrol on bEnd.3 cells against hypoxia compared with DMSO
(0.87-fold change for MTT assay; 2.75-fold change for LDH assay,
both p < 0.05; Fig. 6B and C). Also, ICI182,780 reversed the ability of
resveratrol to prevent paracellular permeability in response to hypoxic insult (1.28-fold change, p < 0.01 vs. resveratrol with DMSO;

conﬁrmed by the results of the TEER measurement (Fig. 6E). In
addition, the levels of TJ proteins were reduced by ICI182,780 from
24 hours CoCl2 exposure (0.66-fold change for claudin-5; 0.71-fold
change for occludin, both p < 0.01 vs. 0 hours; Fig. 6F), comparable

signiﬁcantly changed 24 hours after CoCl2 exposure (CD31-positive,
green, Fig. 7A and B). However, expressions of claudin-5 and occludin
(red) located at the cell membranes (yellow) were decreased by
CoCl2 while resveratrol prevented their reduction (Fig. 7A and B).
ICI182,780 blocked resveratrol effects on CoCl2-induced changes in
claudin-5 and occludin expression. These results suggest that protective effects of resveratrol against hypoxic insults in brain endothelial cells are mediated by ERs and associated with modulation of
TJ protein levels.
3.6. Effects of speciﬁc ERa or ERb antagonist on hypoxic brain
endothelial cells treated with resveratrol
To test whether resveratrol effects on bEnd.3 cells under hypoxia
are ER subtype speciﬁc, we treated cells with the ERa antagonist

MPP or the ERb antagonist PHTPP. The doses of MPP and PHTPP
(both 1 mM) were adopted from previous in vitro endothelial cell
studies (Jobe et al., 2013; Novella et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). Cell
viability (MTT assay) results showed that both MPP and PHTPP
partially blocked the protective effects of resveratrol (0.86-fold
change for both, p < 0.01 vs. DMSO; Fig. 8A). On the other hands,
the reduction of cytotoxicity (LDH assay) by resveratrol was not
affected by either MPP or PHTPP (Fig. 8B). The doses of MPP and
PHTPP used did not affect cell viability and cytotoxicity (Fig. 8C and
D). To conﬁrm the effects of these subtype speciﬁc ER antagonists,
endothelial cell permeability was examined. Neither paracellular
permeability nor TEER was affected by MPP or PHTPP in hypoxic
cells treated with resveratrol, but only ICI182,780 blocked resveratrol effects (p ¼ 0.02 for paracellular permeability and p < 0.01 for
TEER vs. DMSO; Fig. 8E and F), indicating nonspeciﬁc ER-mediated

resveratrol effects. Altogether, these in vitro results indicate that
protective effects of resveratrol against hypoxic insult to brain
endothelial cells are mediated by ERs and associated with modulation of TJ protein levels and thus support the beneﬁcial effects of
resveratrol against ischemic stroke in OVX mice.
4. Discussion
The present study showed that oral resveratrol pretreatment
of OVX female mice for 10 days reduced ischemic brain injury
and improved functional outcome. Resveratrol treatment
resulted in elevated TJ protein levels before subsequent insult,
which brought resistance to BBB permeability against ischemic

injury as shown by less reduction of TJ protein levels and induction of HIF-1a/VEGF in response to ischemic insult. These
effects were reversed by blocking of ICI182,780, indicating that
the effects of resveratrol are ER dependent. In addition,
resveratrol protected brain endothelial cells by modulating TJ
protein and HIF-1a/VEGF protein levels and reducing endothelial cell permeability against hypoxia in vitro. We further
demonstrated that the protective effects of resveratrol against
hypoxia in brain endothelial cells were mediated in nonsubtype
speciﬁc manner because subtype speciﬁc ER antagonists had no
impact on the resveratrol effects.
The daily oral dose of resveratrol (0.1 mg/kg) administered to
OVX mice in the present study was lower than doses tested in male

mice against ischemic insult in other studies (20 and 50 mg/kg)
(Gao et al., 2006; Inoue et al., 2003). It is noteworthy that the
effective doses of resveratrol may not be the same between males
and females (Di Liberto et al., 2012; Shin et al., 2010). We previously
reported that the dose of resveratrol used in male mice for neuroprotection failed to provide protection against ischemic stroke in
the brains of gonadally intact female mice, whereas a much lower
dose (one-ﬁfth) did provide protection in female mice (Shin et al.,
2010). This might be explained by differences in the pharmacokinetics between male and female. In addition, because resveratrol
interacts with ERs, differential expression and distribution of ERs in
normal and ischemic brain between sexes (Kudwa et al., 2006;
Wilson et al., 2011) may partly explain why a smaller dose of
resveratrol was effective in OVX mice in the present study. A recent
study reported that a low-oral dose of resveratrol (0.75 mg/kg,
every 8 hours) prevented neurodegenerative changes in the brain of
rats exposed to streptozotocin (Jing et al., 2013). We also found that
resveratrol at a relatively low concentration (100 nM) protected
brain endothelial cells against hypoxia in vitro, which was also ERdependent, compared with doses used in other studies (0.1e10 mM)
(Clark et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2010). Our results are in agreement
with previous studies using nanomolar concentrations of resveratrol, which are levels similar to dietary polyphenol consumption
such as red wine tested in bovine aortic endothelial and human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (Klinge et al., 2005; Takahashi and
Nakashima, 2012). These studies showed that resveratrol
(10e200 nM) induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase via ERs or
via both ERs and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a in
endothelial cells. Therefore, we suggest that low-dose resveratrol is
effective for protecting the brain of estrogen-deﬁcient females and
brain endothelial cells, and that its mechanism of action is mediated
via ERs.
In the brain of OVX rodents, BBB permeability is increased and TJ
protein levels are decreased even in the absence of insults, and
administration of estrogen reverses these changes (Burek et al.,

2010; Kang et al., 2006; Sandoval and Witt, 2011). It has been
shown that ERs were involved in restoration of TJ protein levels
(Burek et al., 2010). In that study, an ERb agonist increased claudin5 promoter activation in murine brain endothelial cells, whereas
the protein level of claudin-5 was decreased in the brains of ERb
knockout mice compared with wild-type mice, indicating that ERb
is responsible for claudin-5 regulation (Burek et al., 2010). The
ﬁnding suggests that a drug mimicking estrogen can prevent
changes in TJ protein level via ERs in the brains of estrogendeﬁcient females. We showed that resveratrol increased TJ protein levels in the normal brains of OVX mice and also in bEnd.3 cells,
and that these increases were reversed by the ER antagonist. We
further demonstrated that the brains of OVX mice treated with
resveratrol were resistant to BBB breakdown and the reduction of TJ
protein levels caused by ischemic insults. Our results are in agreement with previous studies showing the protective effects of
resveratrol on BBB against insults (Lin et al., 2010; Saha et al., 2012).
For example, dietary supplementation of resveratrol for 6 months
reduced BBB disruption and levels of matrix metalloproteinases
and increased TJ protein levels in the brain of Ppt-1 knockout mice,
a model of infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (Saha et al.,
2012). TJ protein disorganization in cerebrovascular endothelial
cells exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein was also reduced
by resveratrol treatment (Lin et al., 2010). To our knowledge, the
present study is the ﬁrst report to demonstrate that resveratrol
prevents the reduction of TJ protein levels in normal and ischemic
brains of estrogen-deﬁcient female mice.
Activated HIF-1a in response to ischemic and/or hypoxic stimuli
and an increase of its downstream target VEGF correlate with BBB
breakdown (Fan et al., 2009). The exact mechanisms by which
activation of the HIF-1a/VEGF pathway increases BBB permeability
are not clearly deﬁned, but recent studies showed that decreased
expression and disorganization of TJ proteins are associated with
HIF-1a/VEGF-mediated hyperpermeability (Engelhardt et al., 2014;
Yan et al., 2012). These studies showed that hypoxia increased and

stabilized HIF-1a expression, reduced TJ protein levels, and disrupted BBB permeability, all of which were reversed by inhibition of
HIF-1a or VEGF (Engelhardt et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2012). Our results
are also in agreement with previous ﬁndings, showing that BBB
breakdown and changes in TJ protein levels after ischemic and/or
hypoxic insults were associated with induction of HIF-1a and VEGF
protein levels. Therefore, it is possible that the protective effects of
resveratrol are associated with the regulation of HIF-1a/VEGF
signaling after ischemic and/or hypoxic insult. At present, how
resveratrol regulates HIF-1a and VEGF levels in brain endothelial
cells is not completely known. In cancer cell lines, high concentrations (50 and 100 mM) of resveratrol inhibit hypoxia-induced
HIF-1a and VEGF protein accumulation via inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, Akt and p70S6K, and enhanced
protein degradation through the 26S proteasome system (Park
et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2005). In addition to these mechanisms,
ERs may play a role in resveratrol mediated prevention of HIF-1a/
VEGF induction because their expression is inhibited by ER

activation after hypoxic or ischemic insult as shown in the present
study and by others (Coradini et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2011; Shin et al.,
2013b).
Resveratrol shows comparable afﬁnity to both ERa and ERb, and
its agonist or antagonist effects on ERs, especially on ERa activity,
depend on the cell type, as well as concentration and the presence
or the absence of estradiol (Pozo-Guisado et al., 2004). For example,
resveratrol alone had no effect on coronary artery vascular smooth
muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, but when resveratrol was combined with estradiol, it blocked the inhibitory effects of estradiol on
VSMC proliferation via ERa antagonism (Dubey et al., 2010). On the
contrary, resveratrol treatment reduced VSMC proliferation and
restenosis of carotid artery after endothelial denudation injury in
wild-type female mice; these effects were abolished by ICI182,780
and in ERa deﬁcient mice (Khandelwal et al., 2010), suggesting
agonistic effects on ERa. Regarding concentration, 10 mM resveratrol
showed an agonistic effect on ERa-dependent PI3K activity,
whereas concentrations higher than 25 mM showed antagonistic

J.A. Shin et al. / Neurobiology of Aging 36 (2015) 993e1006

activities via degradation of ERa (Pozo-Guisado et al., 2004). In the
present study, the doses of resveratrol used in estrogen-deﬁcient
OVX mice and in vitro in the absence of estrogen did not affect
the levels of ERs. Furthermore, the effects of resveratrol were
reversed by reduction of ER protein by ICI182,780, indicating
agonistic effects of resveratrol on ERs. Therefore, resveratrol may
have beneﬁts in estrogen-deﬁcient female brains by acting as an ER
agonist. However, our results can be applied only to premenopausal
women who have received surgical oophorectomy for medical
reasons. To determine whether resveratrol administration interferes with the action of endogenous estrogen and protects
postmenopausal women from brain diseases, our ﬁndings should
be veriﬁed in animals during natural reproductive senescence,
which is associated with adaptive compensatory responses of the
estrogen-regulated pathway in the brain (Diaz Brinton, 2012).
It is reported that resveratrol-bound ERb has higher transcriptional activity than estradiol-bounded ERb (Bowers et al., 2000),
and therefore, the authors suggest that tissues preferentially
expressing ERb over ERa are potentially more sensitive to estrogen
agonist activity of resveratrol. The notion can be explained by the
ﬁndings that weights of uteri in which ERa is predominantly
expressed were not affected by resveratrol shown in the present
study and others (Zhao et al., 2012). In addition, resveratrol interacts with ERb to increase the antioxidant enzyme Mnsuperoxide dismutase, which provides resistance against ischemic
and/or oxidative stress, in SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma cells
(Robb and Stuart, 2011). Considering that claudin-5 and HIF-1a/
VEGF expression are regulated by ERb (Burek et al., 2010; Shin et al.,
2013b), it could be assumed that ERb activation might be responsible for the protective effects of resveratrol against ischemic and/or
hypoxic insults. However, our results showed that the protective
effects of resveratrol against hypoxia in endothelial cells were not
ER subtype speciﬁc. It is unlikely that the doses of antagonists were
insufﬁcient to block ER subtypes, because doses of ER subtype antagonists comparable with or lower than the dose of ICI182,780
effectively blocked ERa or ERb activities in endothelial cells (Jobe
et al., 2013; Sobrino et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2013). Our results
indicate that the protective actions of resveratrol are mediated by
both ER subtypes at least in brain endothelial cells under hypoxia.
An in vivo study reported that protection afforded by direct injection of resveratrol into the cortex of male rat before 30 minutes
distal MCAO and 5.5 hours after reperfusion was reversed by
coinjection with MPP or PHTPP, suggesting that the resveratrol effect was mediated by either ERa or ERb subtype activation (Saleh
et al., 2013). ERs are expressed in various cell types including
neurons and glia in the brain, and therefore, effects of ER antagonists within the whole brain versus in each cell type might not be
the same. Further studies using genetically or pharmacologically
targeting ERa or ERb in the brains of mice systemically treated with
resveratrol will provide conﬁrmative evidence for the speciﬁcity of
ER subtypes.
The limitation of the present study is that levels of resveratrol
and its metabolites in the brain were not determined. The oral
bioavailability of resveratrol is very low because of its rapid metabolism in the liver and intestine (Walle, 2011). It has been suggested
that conjugated metabolites of resveratrol such as glucuronides and
sulfates have roles in the beneﬁcial effects of resveratrol although
there is limited knowledge about their actions (Robb and Stuart,
2011). In one study evaluating the distribution of resveratrol by
gavage in rats, 18 hours after single-dose administration of [3H]
resveratrol, the radioactivity in the brain was less than 2% of the
administered dose (Abd El-Mohsen et al., 2006). Repeated or
chronic administration may increase the brain tissue level of
resveratrol by saturation of metabolism (Walle, 2011), but there are
no available data for repeated dose pharmacokinetics. Therefore,

the concentration of resveratrol in brain endothelial cells might be
higher than the concentration in the whole brains of OVX mice in
the present study. It is noteworthy that the resveratrol metabolites
detected in the brain after oral administration was mainly native
resveratrol aglycone rather than its conjugated metabolites (Abd ElMohsen et al., 2006). In addition, the low bioavailability but high
bioactivity of resveratrol can be explained by the presence of
deconjugation enzymes in tissues such as b-glucuronidase and
sulfatases, which can convert the metabolites back to the active
parent resveratrol (Maier-Salamon et al., 2013). Thus, resveratrol
itself in the brain after oral administration may have a role in
protective effects, although further study to deﬁne its concentration
in the brain is required. Other actions of resveratrol such as antiinﬂammation and antioxidation, which are important strategies
to protect endothelial cells under ischemic insult, should be also
considered.
In conclusion, the present study showed that pretreatment with
resveratrol reduced ischemic injury and neurologic deﬁcits in OVX
mice. The beneﬁcial effects of resveratrol were associated with
basal increase of TJ protein levels before insults, and after ischemic/
hypoxic insults, less BBB breakdown, HIF-1a/VEGF induction, and
changes in TJ protein levels. The ERs antagonist but not by the
subtype-speciﬁc ER antagonists reversed these effects, indicating
that both classical ERs involve in resveratrol-mediated protection.
Thus, we suggest that resveratrol can be a potential alternative to
estrogens to protect the brains of estrogen-deﬁcient females
against ischemic insult.
