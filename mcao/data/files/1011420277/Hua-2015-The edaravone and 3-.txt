Aim: Compound 10b is a hybrid molecule of edaravone and a ring-opening derivative of 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP). The aim of this study
was to examine the effects of compound 10b on brain damage in rats after focal cerebral ischemia.
Methods: SD rats were subjected to 2-h-middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). At the onset of reperfusion, the rats were orally
treated with NBP (60 mg/kg), edaravone (3 mg/kg), NBP (60 mg/kg)+edaravone (3 mg/kg), or compound 10b (70, 140 mg/kg). The
infarct volume, motor behavior deficits, brain water content, histopathological alterations, and activity of GSH, SOD, and MDA were
analyzed 24 h after reperfusion. The levels of relevant proteins in the ipsilateral striatum were examined using immunoblotting.
Results: Administration of compound 10b (70 or 140 mg/kg) significantly reduced the infarct volume and neurological deficits in
MCAO rats. The neuroprotective effects of compound 10b were more pronounced compared to NBP, edaravone or NBP+edaravone.
Furthermore, compound 10b significantly upregulated the protein levels of the cytoprotective molecules Bcl-2, HO-1, Nrf2, Trx, P-NF-κB
p65, and IκB-α, while decreasing the expression of Bax, caspase 3, caspase 9, Txnip, NF-κB p65, and P-IκB-α.
Conclusion: Oral administration of compound 10b effectively attenuates rat cerebral ischemia injury.

Introduction

Cerebral ischemia is a leading cause of morbidity and one of
the most common causes of death worldwide. This condition
is associated with cardiovascular disease and cancer, and its
incidence increases with age[1]. Mechanisms implicated in the
pathophysiology of ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury include
excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, intracellular calcium overload
and cell death[2–4].
Edaravone (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one), a
novel free radical scavenger, was approved by the Japanese
Ministry of Health in 2001 for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Edaravone exerts neuroprotective effects by scavenging free
radicals, inhibiting lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage
to brain cells, endothelial cells and nerve cells, and reducing
the effects of cerebral ischemia and edema, thus decreasing the

tissue damage caused by acute cerebral infarction[5–8]. Given
that the anionic form of edaravone may also scavenge free
radicals using the one-electron transfer mechanism involved
in protecting nerve cells, we hypothesize that derivatives
of edaravone might be potential agents for therapeutic
intervention following ischemic stroke.
Compound 10b, a novel derivative of edaravone, is
a hybrid of edaravone and a ring-opening derivative of
3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) (Figure 1). Racemic NBP, a natural
compound extracted from celery seed, was approved for
the treatment of ischemic stroke by the State Food and Drug
Administration (SFDA) of China in 2002. It has been reported
that NBP has a variety of biological activities, including
suppressing platelet aggregation and thrombosis, improving
cerebral microcirculation and reducing infarct volume, all of
which are associated with ischemic stroke[9-12]. We recently
reported in a previous study that compound 10b displayed
enhanced antiplatelet aggregation effects and protection
against nerve cell damage via the synergistic action of NBP
and edaravone in vitro[13]. Increasing focus has therefore been

seven groups (12 rats per group), consisting of the sham group
(0.5% CMC-Na, ig), the MCAO group (0.5% CMC-Na, ig),
the NBP group (60 mg/kg NBP, ig), the edaravone group (3.0
mg/kg edaravone, ig), the NBP+edaravone group (60 mg/kg
NBP+3.0 mg/kg edaravone, ig), the low-dose compound 10b
group (70 mg/kg, the dose of 10b being equivalent to that of
NBP+Eda, ig), and the high-dose compound 10b group (140
mg/kg, the dose of 10b was equimolar to that of NBP+Eda,
ig). The drugs were administered at the onset of reperfusion
which lasted for 24 h.

put on the therapeutic potential of compound 10b for cerebral
ischemia injury.
Therefore, the aims of the present study were to investigate
whether compound 10b can provide improved protective
effects on ischemic neuronal injury in vivo and to explore the
possible mitochondrial mechanisms that may underlie the
neuroprotective effects.

Materials and methods

Materials
Compound 10b and NBP were kindly provided by the Center
of Drug Discovery at China Pharmaceutical University. The
purity of 10b and NBP was more than 95%. These compounds
were dissolved in 0.5% sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose
(CMC-Na).
Animal experiments and drug treatment
We investigated the anti-ischemic activity of compound 10b in
a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia by intraluminal
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 2 h followed by recirculation, which has been widely used to evaluate the protective effects of antistroke agents[14]. Adult male
Sprague-Dawley rats (57–61 d old and weighing 250–280 g)
were purchased from B&K Universal Group Limited (Shanghai, China). The rats were housed at 22–24 °C with light from
8:00 am to 8:00 pm. All animals were fed a commercial diet
and had free access to water during the experiment.
The rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg,
ip) and subjected to MCAO as described previously[15], with
slight modifications. The right common carotid artery, internal
carotid artery (ICA), and external carotid artery (ECA) were
briefly exposed. A 4–0 monofilament nylon suture (Beijing
Sunbio Biotech Co, Ltd, Beijing, China) with a rounded tip
was inserted into the ICA through the ECA stump and gently
advanced to occlude the MCA. After 2 h of MCAO, the suture
was withdrawn to restore blood flow (reperfusion). The same
surgery was performed, omitting the MCA occlusion, in shamoperated rats. The core body temperatures were monitored
with a rectal probe and were maintained at 37±0.5 ºC during
the entire procedure. The rats were randomly assigned to
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

Neurological scoring
The neurological function was scored by a blinded observer
24 h after reperfusion. Briefly, the neurological deficits were
graded according to the following scale: 0, no deficit; 1,
forelimb weakness; 2, circling to affected side; 3, inability to
bear weight on the affected side; and 4, no spontaneous motor
activity[16].
Measurement of infarct size
At 24 h after reperfusion, the rats (n=6) were decapitated,
and the brains were rapidly removed, placed on ice, and
sliced into six 2-mm-thick coronal sections. The sections were
stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma
Chemical Co, St Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at 37 °C followed
by overnight immersion in 10% formalin. The infarcted tissue remained unstained (white), whereas normal tissue was
stained red. The infarct zone was demarcated and analyzed
using Image-Pro Plus 6 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD,
USA). The infarcted area was expressed as a percentage of the
total area of the brain.
Measurement of brain water content
At 24 h after reperfusion, some rats from each group (n=6)
were sacrificed, and the brains were rapidly removed onto ice.
Ischemic hemispheres were then isolated from the brains. The
tissue samples were immediately weighed to obtain the wet
weight. The brains were then dried at 100 °C for 24 h to determine their dry weight. The percentage of brain water content
was calculated as (wet weight-dry weight)/wet weight×100%.
Histopathological examination
At 24 h after reperfusion, the rats were deeply anesthetized
with chloral hydrate and perfused with heparinized PBS,
followed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS.
The brain tissue samples were cut coronally into three blocks
from the optic chiasm to the infundibulum of the hypophysis.
The middle blocks were embedded in paraffin. The paraffinembedded tissues were sectioned at 5 μm, and the brain
tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE).
Histopathological evaluation was performed by pathologists
in a blinded manner[17].
Glutathione (GSH) activity assay
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the rats were sacrificed and
the brains were removed. The GSH activity in homogenates

extracted from the cortex of the ischemic hemisphere of the
brain were measured. The antioxidant enzyme activity of
GSH was determined using a modified version of a previously
described method[18]. The reaction mixture was prepared by
combining 600 μL of potassium phosphate buffer (0.05 mol/L,
pH 7.0, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA), 100 μL of 10 mmol/L GSH (reduced
form), 100 μL of 1.5 mmol/L NADPH, and 100 μL of the brain
homogenate supernatant. A 100 μL aliquot of brain homogenate supernatant was added to the reaction mixture and
incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Fifty microliter of 12 mmol/L
t-butyl hydroperoxide was added to this mixture. The change
in absorbance was measured at 340 nm for 1 min. One unit of
activity is equal to 1 mmol of NADPH oxidized/mg protein/min.
The GSH activity was expressed as a fold change relative to
the sham group.
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity assay
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the rats were sacrificed and
the brains were removed. The SOD activity in homogenates
extracted from the cortex of the ischemic hemisphere of the
brain were measured. The SOD activity was measured based
on the extent of inhibition of amino blue tetrazolium formazan
formation in the mixture containing nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide, phenazine methosulphate, and nitroblue tetrazolium (NADH-PMSNBT), as previously described [19, 20].
The assay mixture contained 0.1 mL of the brain homogenate
supernatant, 1.2 mL of sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.3,
0.052 mol/L), 0.1 mL of PMS (186 μmol/L), 0.3 mL of NBT
(300 μmol/L), and 0.2 mL of NADH (750 μmol/L). The reaction was started by the addition of NADH. After incubation
at 30 °C for 90 s, the reaction was stopped by the addition of
0.1 mL of glacial acetic acid. The reaction mixture was stirred
vigorously with 4.0 mL of n-butanol. The intensity of chromogen color in the butanol was measured spectrophotometrically
at 560 nm. The SOD activity was calculated according to the
SOD standard control and expressed as a fold change relative
to the sham group.
Lipid peroxidation level measurement
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the rats were sacrificed and
the brains were removed. The MDA activity in homogenates
extracted from the cortex of the ischemic hemisphere of the
brain was measured. Lipid peroxidation, a major indicator
of oxidative stress, was determined by measuring the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the tissue homogenates. MDA
is an end product of lipid peroxidation, and its level was
determined spectrophotometrically using the thiobarbituric
acid-reactive substances method, with little modification[21, 22].
Briefly, 5 μL supernatant was mixed with 25 μL 3.0% sodium
dodecylsulfate, 75 μL acetic acid buffer (pH 3.5), 75 μL 0.8%
2-thiobarbituric acid, and 20 μL deionized water followed by
heating in a water bath at 95 °C for 1 h. After cooling, 250 μL
of a mixture of n-butanol and pyridine (15:1) was added, and
the mixture was centrifuged at 1400×g for 15 min. The organic
phase was collected, and the fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation at 515 nm and emission at 553 nm. A

standard curve was run simultaneously with each set of
samples by using 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane as an external
standard. The MDA content was expressed as a fold change
relative to the sham group.
Western blot analysis
Extraction of protein in the cytosolic, mitochondrial and
nuclear fractions was isolated by multiple centrifugation using
a mitochondria/nuclei isolation kit (KGA828, Nanjing KeyGEN Biotechnology Co, Ltd, Nanjing, China). The protein
concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid
assay. Equal amounts of protein (40 μg/lane) were subjected
to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corporation, Boston, MA, USA). The blots
were blocked for 2 h in 5% nonfat dry milk-TBS-0.1% Tween
20 and then washed. The blots were incubated overnight with
primary antibodies at 4 °C followed by a 2-h incubation with
a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit
antibody (1:10 000; Bioworld Technology Co, Ltd, Saint Louis,
MN, USA). A gel imaging system (ChemiScope 2850, Clinx
Science Instruments Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China) was used to
detect immunoreactivity as indicated by enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (KGP1123, Nanjing Key-GEN
Biotechnology Co, Ltd, Nanjing, China). The primary antibodies used were polyclonal antibodies against Txnip (ab86983)
(1:500; Abcam Co, Ltd, Cambridge, Cambs, UK), Trx (C63C6),
P-NF-κB p65 (Ser536), NF-κB p65 (C22B4), P-IκB-α, IκB-α,
GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology Co, Ltd, Beverly, MA,
USA), Bcl-2, Bax, caspase 3 (Asp175), caspase 9 (Asp353) COX
IV (3E11) (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), HO-1 (P249), Nrf2 (D1C9) (1:500; Bioworld Technology
Co, Ltd, Saint Louis, MN, USA), and β-actin (1:5000; Bioworld
Technology Co, Ltd, Saint Louis, MN, USA).
Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as the mean±SD. Statistical analyses
were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
multiple comparison test for multiple comparisons. A P value
of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Results

Compound 10b attenuates the neurological deficits after I/R in
Rats
The neurological function of the individual rats was evaluated using Longa’s method 24 h after reperfusion. As shown
in Figure 2A, no obvious neurological deficit was observed
in the sham-operated, CMC-Na-treated animals. Compared
with the rats in the sham-operated group, those in the I/R
group showed prominent neurological deficits 24 h after reperfusion. Post-ischemic treatment with 10b (70 or 140 mg/kg)
significantly improved neurobehavioral function, as indicated
by the 32.26% and 38.71% reduction in neurological deficit
scores, respectively, compared to the I/R group. The neuroprotective effect of the high dose of compound 10b was more
potent than that of NBP (22.58%), Eda (29.03%), or NBP+Eda
(32.26%).

Reduction of infarct size and brain water content in ischemic
brains
The brain infarct size in the individual rats was evaluated by
the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) assay. There
was no infarct damage in the sham group rats (Figure 2B). In
comparison with the untreated I/R group, the infarct size in
the 10b-treated rats was reduced by 52.80% (10b at 70 mg/kg)
and 61.77% (10b at 140 mg/kg) (Figure 2C). Furthermore,
the effects of 10b at 70 mg/kg or 140 mg/kg were more
pronounced than those of NBP (34.41%), Eda (38.47%), and
NBP+Eda (46.45%). Additionally, treatment with low or high
doses of 10b, NBP, Eda, or NBP+Eda markedly reduced the
brain water content of ischemic rats (Figure 2D).
Attenuation of cerebral damage
Histopathological analysis revealed that treatment with 10b
considerably attenuated the cerebral damage in rats compared
with that of I/R-treated model rats. As shown in Figure 3,
HE staining of the ipsilateral hemisphere of ischemic brains
showed cellular edema, neuronal perikarya shrinkage, and
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

macrophage infiltration, whereas cellular edema in the drugtreated rats was not obvious, especially in the animals treated
with compound 10b at 140 mg/kg.
Compound 10b upregulates endogenous antioxidant systems
following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
To further explore the mechanism underlying the antiischemic effect of 10b, we evaluated the levels of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activity of
superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the brain tissues. Compared
with the sham group rats, the levels of GSH in the I/R group
were decreased by 52.56% (from 167.22 to 79.33 nmol/mg).
However, post-ischemic treatment with 10b (70 or 140 mg/kg)
significantly enhanced the GSH levels by approximately
80.64% or 97.30% to 143.30 or 156.52 nmol/mg, respectively,
which were slightly higher than those in the NBP+Eda-treated
rats (69.60%, 134.54 nmol/mg) and significantly higher than
those in the NBP-treated rats (57.15%, 124.67 nmol/mg) or the
Eda-treated rats (61.09%, 127.80 nmol/mg ) (Figure 4A).
Furthermore, the SOD activity in the ischemic brains from

www.chinaphar.com

the I/R group of rats was significantly decreased by 43.15%
(from 182.65 to 103.84 U/mg, Figure 4B) relative to that in the
sham-operated rats. By contrast, treatment with compound
10b at 70 or 140 mg/kg significantly increased the SOD activity by 55.44% (from 103.84 to 161.41 U/mg) and 73.70% (from
103.84 to 180.37 U/mg), respectively, compared with that
in the I/R group. Notably, the SOD activity in rats treated
with 10b at 70 or 140 mg/kg was slightly greater than that of
NBP+Eda-treated (46.70%, 152.33 U/mg) group and significantly greater than that in the NBP-treated rats (35.40%, 140.60
U/mg) or the Eda-treated rats (38.45%, 143.76 U/mg).
Further analysis revealed that the MDA content of the
brain, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, was significantly
elevated by 124.26% (from 8.45 to 18.95 nmol/mg) in the I/R
group compared with that in the sham-operated animals.
However, post-ischemic treatment with 10b at 70 or 140 mg/kg
remarkably decreased the levels of brain MDA by 33.83%
(from 18.95 to 12.54 nmol/mg) and 57.10% (from 18.95 to 8.13
nmol/mg), respectively, compared with that in the I/R group
(Figure 4C). More importantly, the effect of high-dose 10b on
the brain lipid peroxidation was much stronger than that of
NBP (22.59%, 14.67 nmol/mg), Eda (25.35%, 14.15 nmol/mg)
or NBP+Eda (33.98%, 12.51 nmol/mg).
Nuclear factor-E2-related factor (Nrf2) is a key transcription
factor that regulates antioxidant genes as an adaptive response
to oxidative stress or pharmacological stimuli[23, 24]. To investigate the effect of compound 10b treatment on the Nrf2 signaling, the cellular locations of Nrf2 were evaluated after I/R.
Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of Nrf2 in
the nuclear fraction was significantly higher in the 10b (70 or
140 mg/kg), NBP, Eda and NBP+Eda groups than that in the
I/R group (Figure 5B). These results demonstrated that 10b
treatment induced Nrf2 nuclear localization.
Moreover, HO-1 has a key role in the resistance of the neuronal cells to ROS-induced cell death. To evaluate the effects
of 10b treatment on antioxidant enzymes, the cellular locations
of HO-1 were measured after I/R. Compound 10b treatment

(70 or 140 mg/kg) significantly increased the expression of
HO-1 (Figure 5D). An increase in HO-1 expression was also
observed in the NBP+Eda-treated group.
Protection from ROS is mediated by superoxide dismutase
and the glutathione and thioredoxin (Trx) systems [25, 26] .
We therefore measured the expression of Trx and Txnip
by Western blot analysis. The changes in Trx and Txnip
expression after I/R were analyzed in the I/R groups using
immunoblotting. Compared with the I/R group, significant
increases in Trx expression were observed in the 10b-treated
(70 or 140 mg/kg), NBP-treated, Eda-treated and NBP+Edatreated group after I/R (Figure 5Fa). The Txnip level appeared
to decrease slightly in the NBP-treated group and more
prominently in the 10b-treated (70 or 140 mg/kg) groups, the
Eda-treated group and the NBP+Eda-treated group (Figure
5Fb).
Overall, these observations indicate that compound 10b
treatment activates Nrf2, HO-1, and Trx, restrains Txnip,
and upregulates antioxidant enzymes against I/R-induced
neuronal injury.
Compound 10b inhibits apoptosis following cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion
The proto-oncoproteins (Bcl-2 and Bax) are key regulators of
the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway initiated by a variety
of extracellular and intracellular stressors[27–29]. As shown in
Figure 6B, NBP treatment, Eda treatment, NBP+Eda treatment and 10b (70 or 140 mg/kg) treatment significantly
increased the expression of Bcl-2 in mitochondria and inhibited the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria. Caspases
are widely expressed in inactive proenzyme forms in normal cells. Active/cleaved caspases often activate other procaspases, allowing initiation of a protease cascade in apoptotic
cells[30]. Caspase 9 and caspase 3, markers of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, were selected to evaluate the effect
of 10b treatment on the caspase cascade. As shown in Figure
6D, caspase 9 and caspase 3 were activated in the I/R group.

of 10b in vitro. Consequently, Western blot analysis of the I/R
group showed an increase in the expression of NF-κB p65, in
contrast to the change in expression of IκB-α. However, 10b
(70 or 140 mg/kg), NBP, Eda and NBP+Eda treatment mitigated the increased NF-κB p65 and augmented the reduced
IκB-α (Figure 7Ba, 7Bc). Moreover, NBP+Eda treatment
also increased the expression of IκB-α. The expression of
P-NF-κB was significantly decreased in the I/R group, while
10b (140 mg/kg) treatment markedly increased the expression of P-NF-κB, whereas the expression of P-NF-κB was not
influenced by NBP treatment, Eda treatment or NBP+Eda
treatment (Figure 7Bb). In addition, the expression of P-IκB-α
was upregulated in the I/R group, and 10b (70 or 140 mg/kg)
treatment augmented it markedly (Figure 7Bd). These results
indicate that 10b treatment regulates the expression of NF-κB
p65 and rescues the expression of IκB-α to attenuate the neuronal injury following I/R. These results indicate the involvement of activation of NF-κB and TNF-α signaling pathways in
the neuroprotective effect of 10b.

Discussion

Figure 4. Effect of 10b on the level of brain GSH (A), SOD activity (B) and
MDA (C) in the ischemic cerebral cortex of rats after I/R. The data are expressed as the mean±SD of the individual groups of rats (n=6) and were
analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post-hoc
Tukey test. cP<0.01 compared with the sham group. fP<0.01 compared
with the I/R group.

However, both 10b (70 or 140 mg/kg) and the positive drugs
(60 mg/kg NBP, 3 mg/kg Eda, and 60 mg/kg NBP+3 mg/kg
Eda) effectively suppressed the I/R-induced caspase activation, which was decreased compared with the I/R group.
Effects of 10b treatment on protein expression of NF-κB and
IκB-α following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
Previous studies have reported that NF-κB is associated with
cell proliferation and apoptosis, and expression of IκB-α is
well known to block NF-κB activation by conferring resistance
to TNF-induced degradation[31–33]. We next examined whether
NF-κB and IκB-α participated in the neuroprotective effect
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

In the current study, our data demonstrated that compound
10b protected the brain against I/R injury in a rat MCAO
model. We found that treatment with 10b at 70 and 140
mg/kg can provide substantial synergistic neuroprotection
on focal cerebral ischemia compared with NBP treatment (60
mg/kg), edaravone treatment (3 mg/kg) or co-administration
of NBP (60 mg/kg) and edaravone (3 mg/kg). These results
show that the MCAO rats had significant motor behavioral
deficits and extensive infarction in the ipsilateral cerebral
cortical and subcortical areas throughout a series of brain
sections. In the groups treated with NBP, Eda, or NBP+Eda,
a decrease in the infarct volume and brain water content and
an improvement in the neurological deficits were observed,
but greater effects were seen in the rats that were given
10b (140 mg/kg) (Figure 2). HE staining also confirmed
that 10b treatment, NBP treatment, Eda treatment and
NBP+Eda treatment rescued neuronal loss after ischemia.
In addition, the degree of neuroprotection induced by 10b
(70 or 140 mg/kg) treatment was greater than that of NBP
treatment, Eda treatment and NBP+Eda treatment in the
same I/R model (Figure 3). These results suggest that 10b
might mimic the synergistic combination therapy of NBP
and edaravone reported in the previous study[13]. Thus, we
concluded that 10b treatment may induce a stronger degree
of neuroprotection and prevention of cellular edema during
focal cerebral ischemia compared with equivalent NBP+Eda
treatment. At a dose equimolar to the NBP+Eda treatment,
10b also produced greater effects of reduction in infarct
volume, brain water content and improvement of neurological
deficits.
Most of these drugs exert protective effects via their ability
to upregulate the cellular antioxidant defense systems. The
regulation of most of these antioxidant enzymes occurs
through activation of Nrf2[34]. Previous studies have shown
that Nrf2 translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus and

binds to the antioxidant responsive element (ARE)[35], a cisacting regulatory element or enhancer sequence, found in
the promoter region of certain genes, including glutathione
synthase, HO-1, and catalase[36]. The coordinated action of
Nrf2 mediates the response to oxidative stress[37]. Compound
10b treatment mitigated oxidative stress as evidenced by

the decreased levels of MDA (Figure 4C). This was the first
study to report that 10b treatment significantly induced the
translocation of Nrf2 and HO-1 to the nucleus (Figure 5B and

systems including those of GSH, SOD, and HO-1 (Figure 4A,

role in neuroprotection induced by 10b treatment (Figure 5B).
The major finding of the current study supports the idea that
10b treatment can induce a signaling mechanism to combat
oxidative stress, as evidenced by the ability of 10b treatment
to increase cellular antioxidants and substantially reduce
intracellular ROS production via the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
Specifically, compared with treatment with NBP+Eda,
treatment with equimolar 10b can significantly induce the
suppression of MDA, translocation of Nrf2 and HO-1 to the
nucleus and markedly increase the cellular antioxidant defense
systems including those of GSH, SOD, and HO-1.
In addition, we determined whether the levels of the
endogenous proteins Trx and Txnip are modulated in
response to 10b treatment. Immunoblot analysis showed a

significant decrease in Txnip expression in the 10b-treated
(70 or 140 mg/kg) rats compared with those in the I/R group
(Figure 5Fb). The Trx level, on the other hand, was markedly
increased in the NBP-treated, Eda-treated and NBP+Edatreated rats. Trx upregulation was more evident in the
10b-treated group (Figure 5Fa). Considerable 10b-induced
changes were observed in Txnip protein levels. Txnip is
involved in redox regulation through interaction with the
catalytic active center of Trx and downregulates its activity
and expression [38, 39] . Thus, Txnip is considered to be a
negative regulator of Trx and redox. Modulation of the Txnip
and Trx levels after I/R observed in this study agree with the
published data[39]. The compound 10b-induced reduction of
Txnip expression is most likely responsible for the reduced

upregulation of Trx. These changes in Txnip and Trx levels,
which are predominantly affected by 10b treatment, are
particularly interesting. These results show that in the group
treated with 10b at a dose of equal molarity to NBP+Edatreatment, there was a significant decrease in the Txnip
expression and a marked increase in the Trx protein levels in
contrast with the effects of the NBP+Eda treatment.
Regarding mitochondrial protection, 10b sequentially
inhibited both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent
mitochondrial cell death pathways. By suppressing both
Bax translocation to the mitochondrial membrane and the
downregulation of Bcl-2 induced by I/R, 10b could block
subsequent caspase activation, thus partially preventing
apoptotic cell death. Compared with the NBP group or the
Eda group (Figure 6B), the increase of Bcl-2 level is more
prominent in the 10b group (Figure 6Ba). Moreover, based on
the recent observation that Bcl-2 regulates both Ca2+ release
from the endoplasmic reticulum[40] and the essential pool of
mitochondrial GSH[41], we propose that 10b could maintain
[Ca2+]i homeostasis and enhance the mitochondrial antioxidant
status by upregulating Bcl-2. In contrast to 10b, the other
treatments (NBP, Eda and NBP+Eda) had no significant effect
on the Bax level (Figure 6Bb). Thus, it seems reasonable
to speculate that 10b blocks Bax translocation. It follows
that 10b could more strongly suppress the Bcl-2 level and
downregulate the expression of Bax, caspase 3, and caspase 9
than NBP+Eda treatment at the dose equivalent to that of 10b.
NF-κB is widely expressed throughout the central nervous
system, seen in all cell types and is constitutively expressed
in neurons[42]. The correlation of NF-κB activation with cerebral ischemia was firstly identified in glial cells of postmortem human brains, primarily in the penumbra[43]. Elevated
NF-κB activation has also been reported in various rat models of cerebral ischemia, with initial studies suggesting that
this activation promotes cell death. Our data confirm earlier
reports of NF-κB activation in the brain after MCAO[44] and
suggest that 10b can exacerbate the activation of NF-κB seen
in the brains of rats after I/R (Figure 7Ba). The data shown
in Figure 7Ba indicate that NF-κB was indeed translocated
to the nucleus in the 10b-treated rats after I/R, suggesting a role in transcriptional activation. The phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB has been shown to increase
transcriptional activity (Figure 7Bb) [45]. It has also been
shown that phosphorylation of the p65 subunit is induced in
response to a variety of apoptotic stimuli[44]. The increased
phosphorylation of p65 in the 10b-treated rats after I/R suggests that upregulation of NF-κB could be involved in the
progression and regulation of the genes that control neuronal apoptosis. To this end, we investigated whether NF-κB
activation was correlated with increased IκB-α phosphorylation in our rat model of I/R. Our results clearly demonstrate increased phosphorylation of IκB-α in the NBP-treated
and Eda-treated rats with a maximum in those treated with
NBP+Eda treatment, which closely resembles the kinetics of
phosphorylation of IκB-α in 10b (70 mg/kg) (Figure 7Bd).
In the 10b (140 mg/kg) group, the degree of phosphorylaActa Pharmacologica Sinica

tion began to return to the levels seen in sham animals and
was correlated with the kinetics of NF-κB activation. It thus
appears that 10b treatment with an equivalent dose to that
used for NBP+Eda demonstrated a greater decrease in the protein levels of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and phosphorylation of
IκB-α than the NBP+Eda treatment. In the group treated with
10b at a dose equimolar to NBP+Eda, there was markedly
increased expression of phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of
NF-κB and IκB-α compared with those treated with NBP+Eda.
We show herein, for the first time, in vivo evidence that
NF-κB activation during I/R injury is independent of the proteolytic degradation of IκB-α, and that this regulation is likely
to occur at the level of increased tyrosine kinase activity. Its
activity is regulated by upregulation of its inhibitor, IκB-α,
which can sequester active NF-κB in the cytoplasm[46]. It is
well established that NF-κB can be induced by reactive oxygen
species, and, by contrast, antioxidants are capable of inhibiting
the proteolytic degradation of IκB[47]. However, we show here
that NF-κB activation is independent of IκB degradation and
likely involves phosphorylation of IκB-α, which leads to liberation of NF-κB and subsequent translocation to the nucleus.
The finding that NF-κB was not activated by the normal IκBdegradative pathway also ruled out an important role for
TNF-α in the initial induction of the immediate-early response
genes, because TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation occurs via
IκB-α degradation[48]. The IκB kinase has yet to be identified,
but, based on findings in these studies, this kinase may prove
to be an attractive target for early intervention in the inflammatory cascade following the I/R associated with cerebral
ischemia. Although the role of NF-κB activation in the context
of beneficial effects in the protection against apoptosis has
been somewhat controversial, inhibition of NF-κB activation
may have an overall beneficial effect for I/R injury in cerebral
ischemia.

Conclusion

In the light of current findings, we postulate that compound
10b may play a neuroprotective role by improving
mitochondrial function, preventing mitochondriadependent cell death and promoting the NF-κB/TNF-α
signaling pathway. The translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus,
accompanied by upregulation of the endogenous antioxidant
systems, was partly responsible for the neuroprotective
effect of 10b treatment. In our experiments, 10b (particularly
at the higher dose) appears to be more potent in ischemic
neuroprotection than NBP, edaravone or the NBP+edaravone
mixture. Together, these results indicate that compound 10b
is an attractive candidate for intervention of ischemic stroke
and merits further study.
