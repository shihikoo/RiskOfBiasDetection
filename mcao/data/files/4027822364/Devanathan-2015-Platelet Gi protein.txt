Platelets are crucial for hemostasis and thrombosis and exacerbate
tissue injury following ischemia and reperfusion. Important regulators of platelet function are G proteins controlled by seven
transmembrane receptors. The Gi protein Gαi2 mediates platelet
activation in vitro, but its in vivo role in hemostasis, arterial thrombosis, and postischemic infarct progression remains to be determined. Here we show that mice lacking Gαi2 exhibit prolonged
tail-bleeding times and markedly impaired thrombus formation
and stability in different models of arterial thrombosis. We thus
generated mice selectively lacking Gαi2 in megakaryocytes and
platelets (Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice) and found bleeding defects comparable to those in global Gαi2-deficient mice. To examine the impact of platelet Gαi2 in postischemic thrombo-inflammatory infarct
progression, Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice were subjected to experimental
models of cerebral and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. In
the model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke
Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice developed significantly smaller brain infarcts
and fewer neurological deficits than littermate controls. Following
myocardial ischemia, Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice showed dramatically
reduced reperfusion injury which correlated with diminished formation of the ADP-dependent platelet neutrophil complex. In conclusion, our data provide definitive evidence that platelet Gαi2 not
only controls hemostatic and thrombotic responses but also is critical for the development of ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo.

Only P2Y12 receptors are therapeutically targeted by antagonists,
which inhibit platelet aggregation in patients (10, 11). Correspondingly, mice lacking the P2Y12 receptor exhibit a profound defect in
platelet activation (7, 8) with prolonged bleeding times which correlate with impaired formation and stability of thrombi. However,
the impact of this pathway on the progression of thrombo-inflammatory infarcts in the postischemic brain and heart is unknown. The
P2Y12 receptor is reported to signal selectively through the G protein Gi2, although biochemical reconstitution experiments suggest
that it interacts with other Gi isoforms such as Gi3 (11–13). Platelet
Gi2, however, may interact not only with P2Y12 but also with additional GPCRs present in platelets. Regardless of these considerations, and unlike murine platelets deficient in P2Y12 receptors,
Gαi2-deficient platelets show only a moderate inhibition of platelet
aggregation in vitro, and the translation of this defect into the in vivo
situation has not been reported thus far (14, 15).
A different approach to study how Gαi2 affects in vivo thrombotic activity of platelets came from a knockin mouse line in which
regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS)-insensitive Gαi2 (G184S)
was expressed (16). However, the complexity and severity of the
phenotype is likely to limit further studies on the progression of
platelet-dependent thrombo-inflammatory infarcts (16).
Here, we show that Gαi3 only partially compensates for the loss of
Gαi2, revealing that platelet Gαi2 plays a dual role in both thrombus
formation in injured vessels and in progression of tissue damage
after focal cerebral ischemia or myocardial infarction.
Significance

P

latelet activation at sites of vascular injury is essential for
normal hemostasis but also is a major pathomechanism underlying acute ischemic disease states such as stroke or myocardial infarction, which represent leading causes of death and
severe disability worldwide (1–3).
Upon vascular injury, exposed extracellular matrix constituents of the damaged vessel wall allow initial adhesion of platelets, initiating intracellular signaling cascades that result in
platelets’ firm adhesion and aggregation (2, 3). Activated platelets deliver diffusible local mediators, such as ADP or thromboxane A2, to recruit and activate additional platelets into the
growing thrombus. Hence, ADP potentiates the aggregatory effects of other stimuli such as thrombin and collagen and thereby
contributes to stable thrombus formation. These mediators orchestrate platelet signaling by activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (4). In particular, platelet activation by ADP is
mediated by two GPCRs, P2Y1, which couples to the heterotrimeric G protein Gq, and P2Y12, which couples to Gi proteins
(5). Deficiency of either P2Y1 or P2Y12 receptors leads to a
reduced aggregation response following ADP stimulation, suggesting a complementary function of the two types of G proteins,
Gq and Gi, in the induction of platelet activation (6–9).

Platelet activation is crucial for hemostasis and thrombosis but
also contributes to inflammation and progression of tissue damage following ischemia/reperfusion injury. Here we demonstrate
that platelet activation through the Gi protein Gαi2 not only
controls hemostatic responses but also thrombo-inflammatory
tissue damage following cerebral and cardiac ischemia. Our report
on a dual role of Gi proteins in platelet function opens new options for pharmaco-therapeutic strategies fighting ischemic diseases such as heart attack and stroke.

Results
Gαi2 Plays a Critical Role in Hemostasis. Earlier in vitro studies with

platelets from Gαi KO mice had indicated a selective role for
Gαi2 in ADP-induced platelet aggregation (14, 15). Here, we
observed that Gαi2-deficient platelets exhibited a moderately
reduced aggregation response not only to ADP but also to other
stimuli such as collagen or collagen-related peptide (CRP) (Fig.
S1A). Mechanistically, a defect in integrin αIIbβ3 activation
(Fig. S1C) and degranulation-dependent P-selectin exposure
(Fig. S1B) following various stimuli was evident, but the stimulated rise of intracellular calcium was unaffected (Fig. S2).
To assess the role of Gαi in platelet function further, we examined the ability of platelets from Gαi-deficient mice to form
aggregates on collagen under flow (Fig. S3). WT and Gαi3deficient platelets adhered to collagen fibers and formed aggregates that consistently grew into large thrombi. In contrast,
Gαi2-deficient platelets initially adhered to collagen and were
able to form smaller aggregates, but these aggregates subsequently failed to propagate into stable thrombi (Fig. S3 B and
6492 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1505887112

C). These results show that Gαi2 has a significant role in forming
stable aggregates under high-shear flow conditions. To test whether
this defect translated into a bleeding diathesis, we measured
tail-bleeding times in Gαi2-deficient mice using the filter paper
method (Fig. 1). We found markedly prolonged bleeding times
in Gαi2-deficient mice compared with Gαi3-deficient and WT
mice, and bleeding had to be stopped manually in 50% of the
Gαi2-deficient animals to avoid excess blood loss (Fig. 1A). In
addition, Gαi2-deficient mice showed considerable variations
in tail-bleeding intensity (Fig. 1B). Together, these data show that
Gαi2 deficiency results in a moderate defect in platelet aggregation
in vitro which translates into a severe hemostatic defect in vivo.
Gαi2 Deficiency in Mice Alters the in Vivo Thrombotic Profile. To
assess the effect of Gαi2 deficiency on occlusive thrombus formation in vivo, we used two well-established models of arterial
thrombosis. In the first model, vascular injury was induced in the
abdominal aorta mechanically by a single firm compression with
a forceps, and blood flow was monitored with an ultrasonic flow
probe (25). In WT and Gαi3-deficient mice, injury-provoked
thrombosis resulted in complete and irreversible occlusion of the
vessels within 10 min (Fig. 2 A and B). In contrast, platelets from
Gαi2-deficient mice did not form occlusive thrombi within the
observation time of 30 min (Fig. 2 A and B). In a second model,
we monitored thrombus formation in FeCl3-injured mesenteric
arterioles using intravital microscopy (26). In all WT mice examined, the formation of small platelet aggregates started within
10 min after injury (Fig. 2 C and D), resulting in complete vessel
occlusion within 20 min (Fig. 1E and Movie S1). In contrast,
although the initial adhesion and formation of small aggregates
was similar in arterioles from WT and Gαi2-deficient mice (Fig. 2
C and D), the formation of stable and occlusive thrombi did not
occur in the majority of arterioles during the observation period
of 40 min (Fig. 2E and Movie S2), revealing a pivotal role for
Gαi2 in occlusive thrombus formation in vivo.
Up-Regulated Gαi3 Partially Compensates for the Missing Gαi2. Deletion of one Gαi isoform in mice can provoke an up-regulation
of the expression levels of the remaining isoforms, which may
substitute for some but not all functions (17, 19, 29–33). Because
we observed a clear-cut phenotype in the Gαi2 KO mice, we
analyzed the expression of Gαi isoforms in their platelets. As in
human platelets, we detected two Gαi proteins, i.e., Gαi2 and
Gαi3, by immunoblotting (Fig. S4 A and B). Importantly, a significant up-regulation of platelet Gαi3 in the absence of Gαi2 was

Selective Gαi2 Deficiency in Platelets Is Accompanied by Gαi3 UpRegulation. Next, the specific role of Gαi2 in platelets was studied

in a mouse line that was generated by breeding conditional
Gαi2 mice (Gnai2fl/fl) with mice expressing Cre recombinase
under the control of the platelet factor 4 (PF4) promoter (19, 34).
The efficient and platelet-specific deletion of Gαi2 was confirmed,
and an increased expression of Gαi3 became evident by immunoblotting (Fig. S7 A and B). Like the global Gαi2-deficient
mice, Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice displayed unaltered platelet counts
and volume as well as expression of prominent platelet surface
receptors (Tables S1 and S2). Platelet aggregation measurements
(Fig. S7C), flow cytometric analysis of integrin αIIbβ3 activation
(Fig. S7D), and degranulation-dependent P-selectin exposure
(Fig. S7E) presented defects caused by a selective deficiency of
Gαi2 in platelets in response to various stimuli. Interestingly, in
the presence of a specific P2Y12 antagonist, ARC69931, ADPinduced aggregation of Gαi2-deficient platelets was reduced
further (Fig. S7F), indicating that they still responded to thienopyridines and further supporting our data that Gαi3 is a potential

downstream regulator of P2Y 12 . In addition, we ruled out the
possibility that reduced ATP release is responsible for these
defects (Fig. S7G).
Selective Deficiency of Gαi2 in Platelets Impairs Hemostasis. Next, we assessed role of platelet Gαi2 in hemostasis by performing bleedingtime assays. In WT (Gnai2+/+) mice and most Gnai2fl/fl control mice,
tail bleeding stopped within 10 min (Fig. S7H). In contrast, the
majority of Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre+ mice showed greatly prolonged
tail bleeding similar to that in global Gαi2-deficient mice. A second
bleeding assay in which the tip-amputated tail was inserted into a
tube with PBS confirmed prolonged bleeding (Fig. 3B) and fluctuations in bleeding intensity (Movies S3 and S4). In conclusion,
selective deletion of Gαi2 in platelets and megakaryocytes is sufficient to produce a pronounced bleeding defect.
Platelet-Specific Gαi2 Deficiency Results in Neuroprotection Following
Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury. Platelets are thought to

integrate pathways that orchestrate both thrombotic and inflammatory processes, resulting in a thrombo-inflammatory
cascade in acute ischemic disease states in which tissue damage
occurs despite successful recanalization of occluded vessels, a
process referred to as “reperfusion injury” (3, 35, 36). To evaluate the impact of platelet Gαi2 on infarct progression, we
challenged Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice in the tMCAO model in
which a filament reversibly occludes the middle cerebral artery
and reduces the regional cerebral flow by >90% (25). After 1 h the
filament is removed to allow reperfusion for 24 h. Subsequently,
mice are tested for their motor and coordination functions.
Interestingly, assessment of the global neurologic function
(Bederson score) (Fig. 4A) revealed that Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice
developed significantly fewer neurologic deficits and had significantly better (higher) scores in motor function tests (Fig. 4B) than
littermate controls. These findings were accompanied by a reduction in infarct volumes by >60% in Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice

evident. A similar picture emerged from analysis of pertussis toxin
(PTX)-catalyzed [32P]ADP ribosylation of Gαi proteins (Fig.
S4C). From these data one may conclude that the up-regulated
and functionally intact Gαi3 cannot rescue defects caused by the
missing Gαi2. Nonetheless, an ADP-induced platelet aggregation
still occurred in the absence of Gαi2, suggesting that Gαi3 may
partially compensate for Gαi2. To explore this possibility in more
detail, we administered PTX, a selective pan-Gαi inhibitor, into
WT mice (Fig. S5) and analyzed platelet aggregation and thrombus
formation ex vivo and in vivo (Figs. S1, S3, and S6). In summary,
the results demonstrated a much stronger PTX-mediated inhibition
of platelet activation, aggregation, and thrombus formation than
seen with Gαi2 deficiency, suggesting a partial compensatory role
for Gαi3 in these processes.

Discussion
Activated platelets not only are essential for thrombus initiation,
formation, and stabilization but also promote inflammation and
progression of tissue damage even after reperfusion of previously
occluded arteries (40). Activation of platelets involves numerous
cell-surface receptors coupled to G proteins, and the Gαi2 protein has been suggested to be important in this scenario, but its
exact in vivo function has long remained undefined. Here, we
show that Gαi2 is crucial for thrombus stabilization in the course
of hemostasis and experimental thrombosis. In addition, our study
reveals an important function of platelet Gαi2 in the development

damage, we assessed myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury in
control mice and mutant littermates (Fig. 5). In this acute invasive model, the left coronary artery is occluded for 1 h. We
used a hanging-weight system for coronary artery occlusion as
described previously (28, 31). Inspection of TTC-stained heart
discs immediately visualized differences between Gnai2fl/fl/PF4Cre mice and controls (Fig. 5A and Fig. S8B). For statistical
analysis, the degree of myocardial destruction was calculated as
percentage of infarcted myocardium to area at risk (AAR).
Although the AAR did not differ between the two groups (Fig.
S8A), infarct size was 43.0 ± 3.7% of AAR in control mice but
was significantly reduced to 21.8 ± 3.3% of AAR in Gnai2fl/fl
/PF4-Cre mice (Fig. 5B).
These results identified platelet Gαi2 as an important intracellular switch that controls not only platelet-dependent thrombosis but also thrombo-inflammatory infarct progression during
reperfusion following stroke and cardiac ischemia.
Accumulating evidence suggests that platelets are part of the
immune cell arsenal. In particular, cross-talk between platelets and
leukocytes is a common feature of immune reactions with formation of PNCs affecting the extent of inflammatory tissue damage
(28, 37–39). Therefore we examined the formation of PNCs after
myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (Fig. 5C) and found that
PNC levels in Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice (45.4 ± 12.7) were less
than 10% of the levels in littermate controls (587.8 ± 189.6),
resulting in less tissue destruction (Fig. S8C). Moreover, in the
absence of infarction, platelets and neutrophils from Gnai2fl/fl
/PF4-Cre mice showed defective PNC formation upon ADP
stimulation (Fig. 5D).
In conclusion, Gαi2 integrates signaling pathways controlling
both platelet aggregation and inflammation during ischemia/
reperfusion injury, thereby enabling platelets to bridge hemostasis and inflammation.

of cerebral and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. These
findings emphasize a thrombo-inflammatory role of platelets and
put platelet Gαi2 in the center of controlling both hemostasis and
inflammation.
Previous studies focused on acute responses of isolated
platelets from Gαi KO mice to stimuli, leaving the question on
the in vivo relevance of Gi signaling unanswered (14, 15, 41). We
show that global Gαi2 but not Gαi3 deficiency produces a marked
increase in bleeding time, although spontaneous hemorrhage
was not evident. The same profound bleeding phenotype was
seen in Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice, demonstrating a central role of
platelet Gαi2 in hemostasis. Of note, a similar primary hemostatic defect is seen in mice lacking the Gi-coupled ADP receptor
P2Y12 (5, 6, 8).
Initially, we confirmed previous data that Gαi3 deficiency did
not result in a platelet-specific phenotype. However, PTX treatment of mice produced a much stronger reduction of platelet
function than Gαi2 deficiency. Interestingly, and in contrast to
previous reports, we noticed an up-regulation of Gαi3 expression
in Gαi2 KO mice which we identified to be the only PTX substrates in platelets (12–15, 41). Therefore, we assume that Gαi3
partially compensates for the missing Gαi2. In fact, Gαi3 has been
shown to interact with P2Y12 in a purified reconstituted system
(12). Further support for this conclusion comes from the finding
that the specific P2Y12 receptor antagonist ARC69931 blunts the
residual response to ADP in Gαi2-deficient platelets. Taken together, the platelet P2Y12 receptor signals through two Gαi isoforms with Gαi2 being the pathophysiologically dominant one.
In tail-bleeding assays we observed variability in bleeding intensity in Gαi2-deficient mice which paralleled defective formation and stabilization of arterial thrombi seen in two arterial
thrombosis models. These findings agree with impaired thrombus stability seen in P2Y12 receptor-deficient mice (5, 6) and are
complementary to reports from a heterozygous RGS-insensitive
Gαi2 mutant (+/G184S) demonstrating increased platelet accumulation and aggregation at vascular injury sites in vivo, although the effects on bleeding times in this mouse model were
not reported (42, 43). Thus, Gαi2 represents the dominant signaling entity downstream of the ADP-binding P2Y12 receptor
where either its absence or its uncontrolled increased signaling
activity has a profound impact on thrombus formation and stability, indicating that balanced Gαi2 activity assures normal hemostasis and thrombosis.
Devanathan et al.

Platelets also contribute to secondary infarct progression by
inflammatory mechanisms that may differ from those involved in
thrombus formation (3, 36). Interestingly, Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice
displayed a significant protection against cerebral ischemia, and
this protection was associated with a marked reduction in neurological deficits and better performance in motor functions,
highlighting the pathophysiological importance of Gαi2 in platelets during reperfusion injury. Interestingly, microscopic analysis
of brain slices showed no increased incidence of intracranial
hemorrhage in Gnai2fl/fl/PF4-Cre mice following tMCAO, indicating that inhibition of Gαi2 signaling may represent a safe
approach to prevent or treat acute stroke. This assumption is
corroborated by data from a second model in which Gnai2fl/fl/PF4Cre mice also were protected from myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. This finding supports and extends our view that
early steps in platelet activation and amplification mechanisms
are critical factors in infarct development (35, 44, 45).
It is noteworthy that the data presented here argue for a
concerted action of activated platelets and leukocytes to aggravate infarct progression. Moreover, in both cell types Gαi2
seems to represent a central switch of regulation. Although the
central role of Gαi2 in leukocyte function is well established,
our study also indicates a corresponding role for Gαi2 in
platelets. Previously, pharmacological inhibition of the Gicoupled ADP P2Y12 receptors has been reported to inhibit
PNCs and platelet-dependent leukocyte activation (46, 47),
whereas other ex vivo or in situ studies suggested that P2Y12
receptor blockers decrease cardiac reperfusion injury by
mechanisms other than inhibition of intravascular coagulation
(48, 49). Our data clearly show that lack of the P2Y12 signaltransducing Gαi2 in platelets results in the reduced formation of
ADP-dependent PNCs which correlates with a significant reduction in cardiac reperfusion injury. Because platelets express
also other GiPCRs relevant for putative platelet immune
functions, a future aim will be to dissect the pathophysiological
role of Gi proteins for these signaling pathways (50). In this
context, it is tempting to speculate about roles for other Gαi
proteins, such as Gαi3, which is expressed in platelets, but its
function remains to be elucidated.
Taken together, our findings reveal that the thrombotic and
inflammatory functions of platelets converge at the level of
the signal transducer Gαi2. As a consequence, the severity of
stroke or cardiac infarcts is determined by a platelet-intrinsic
