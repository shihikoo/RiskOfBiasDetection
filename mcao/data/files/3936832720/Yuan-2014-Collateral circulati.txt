The rat suture middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is a frequently used
animal model for investigating the mechanisms of ischemic brain injury. During
suture MCAO, transection of the external carotid artery (ECA) potentially
restrains blood flow and impairs masticatory muscle and other ECA-supported
territories, consequently influencing post-operation animal survival. This study
was aimed at investigating the effect of ECA transection on the hemodynamic
alterations using a novel synchrotron radiation (SR) angiography technique and
magnetic resonance imaging in live animals. Fifteen male adult Sprague-Dawley
rats were used in this study. Animals underwent MCAO, in which the ECA was
transected. SR angiography was performed before and after MCAO. Rats then
underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect the tissue lesion both
intra- and extra-cranially. Animals with SR angiography without other
manipulations were used as control. High-resolution cerebrovascular
morphology was analyzed using a novel technique of SR angiography. The
masticatory muscle lesion was further examined by hematoxylin and eosin
staining. MRI and histological results showed that there was no masticatory
muscle lesion at 1, 7 and 28 days following MCAO with ECA transection. In
normal condition, the ECA and its branch external maxillary artery were clearly
detected. Following ECA transection, the external maxillary artery was still
observed and the blood supply appeared from the anastomotic branch from the
pterygopalatine artery. SR angiography further revealed the inter-relationship
of hemisphere extra- and intra-cranial vasculature in the rat following MCAO.
Transection of the ECA did not impair masticatory muscles in rat suture MCAO.
Interrupted blood flow could be compensated by the collateral circulation from
the pterygopalatine artery.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is known as a leading cause of mortality and
morbidity throughout the world. Currently, there are still no
effective therapies available despite some promising advances
in basic research. However, bench results often do not parallel
with clinical outcomes. One of the reasons for this is the
deviation of animal models. For instance, the rat suture model
of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) has been widely
accepted as a valid model, which mimics the human ischemic

stroke (Koizumi et al., 1986; Longa et al., 1989); however, some
disadvantages of the suture model have also been claimed
such as premature reperfusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage,
fluctuations of infarct volume and gradual loss of weight
(Schmid-Elsaesser et al., 1998; Boyko et al., 2010; Guan et al.,
2012). These complications are likely to affect the results of
experimental animal ischemic stroke for further therapeutic
interventions.
The common carotid artery (CCA) branches into the
external carotid artery (ECA) and the internal carotid artery
(ICA). The ICA then gives off the pterygopalatine artery

(PPA) and its intra-cranial branches. The ECA is the major
blood supplying artery of masticatory muscles in rats. Generally, ECA transection is necessary for the suture model to
insert the suture from the ECA stump, and reperfusion can
also be achieved by withdrawing the suture to the stump. The
impact of ECA transection on masticatory muscles is a topic
of continuous debate. In 2003, Dittmar et al. reported the
impairment of masticatory and temporal muscle after sutureinduced MCAO in Wistar rats (Dittmar et al., 2003). The same
complications were also observed in Sprague-Dawley rats
(Palmer et al., 2001). The loss of body weight was attributed to
the impairment of the masticatory muscle by ECA transection.
Thus, a lot of effort has been made to optimize the suture
model in order to prevent ischemic injury of the ECA territory
from ischemia (Dittmar et al., 2005a; Boyko et al., 2010).
Nevertheless, Gerriets and associates re-evaluated the
ischemia of temporal muscle by using three different rat stroke
models, concluding that there were no muscle hyper-intensities in both Wistar rats and Sprague-Dawley rats after
MCAO (Dittmar et al., 2005b).
Weight loss after stroke was continually reported in a
large number of ischemic studies; however, this important
phenomenon has attracted little attention and has never been
formally studied (Dirnagl, 2010). The impairment of masticatory muscles is frequently described as the most important
factor for low survival rates and gradual weight loss, yet the
correlation between intra- and extra-cranial blood supply after
MCAO remains obscure. Synchrotron radiation (SR) imaging
in ex vivo tissue and in vivo small animals has been developed
over the past 15 years (Shirai et al., 2013; Popescu et al., 2011).
The high resolution of SR angiography enables researchers to
dynamically investigate the intra- and extra-cranial microcirculation in rodents (Shirai et al., 2013). The purpose of the
present study was to explore the effect of the blood supply
alteration and the collateral opening on the injury of masticatory muscle in a rat intraluminal suture MCAO model.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental design

Animal surgical procedures and experimental protocols
were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) and the Bioethics Committee
of the School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong
University, Shanghai, China. Fifteen adult male SpragueDawley rats (Sppir-BK Inc., Shanghai, China) weighing 250â€“
280 g were used in this study. Animals underwent magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) before and 1, 7 and 28 days after
MCAO to detect the tissue lesion intra- and extra-cranially.
SR angiography was performed before and after ECA transection. Animals characterized with SR angiography without
MCAO were used as control.

tized with ketamine (100 mg kg 1) and xylazine (10 mg kg 1)
intraperitoneally. Animals were then placed supinely on a
heating pad maintaining body temperature at 310  0.5 K. The
left CCA, ECA and ICA were isolated under an operating
microscope (Leica; Wetzlar, Germany). After ECA transection, a silicone-coated 4-0 suture (Dermalon, 1756-31, Covidien, OH, USA) was inserted into the ECA stump and
advanced from the ICA to the ostium of the MCA until a slight
resistance was felt. Body weight was measured before and 1, 3,
7, 14 and 28 days after MCAO.
2.3. Magnetic resonance imaging

After MCAO, rats were re-anesthetized with ketamine/
xylazine intraperitoneally. MRI examination of brain and neck
were performed before and after the operation using a 3 T
MR apparatus (GESigna3T; GE Healthcare, CT, USA) using
an animal head coil with T2-weighted fast spin-echo sequence
(time of repetition = 5840 ms, time of echo = 106 ms, field of
view = 60 mm  60 mm, matrix = 256  256, slice thickness =
1.5 mm, four collections). T2-weighted images were obtained
before and 1, 7 and 28 days after MCAO. Brightness and
contrast were adjusted for optimal display of the tissue.
2.4. SR angiography

SR angiography was conducted at beamline BL13W at
Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). Imaging
parameters and procedures have been described previously
(Yuan et al., 2012). An average beam current of 145 mA and
X-ray energy of 33.2 keV was used. A custom-made T-shaped
catheter, formed by connecting a PE-10 tube with a PE-50
tube, was invasively embedded into the CCA prior to imaging.
Then, the rat was placed vertical to the beam on its left side,
and 150 ml of contrast agent (Ipamiro, Shanghai, China) with a
concentration of 175 mgI ml 1 (350 mgI ml 1, diluted to 50%
volume ratio with saline) was injected into the CCA through
the T-tube at an injecting rate of 133.3 ml s 1 using a microsyringe pump (Longer; Baoding, China). A PCO X-ray CCD
camera (pixel size 9 mm  9 mm; PCO-TECH Inc., Germany)
was used to obtain high-resolution real-time angiographic
images. The CCD camera was placed 65 cm away from the
sample stage.
2.5. Hematoxylin and eosin staining

Animals were anesthetized after SR angiography and
perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
transcardially. The masticatory muscle was fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 24 h and dehydrated using a graded
alcohol system and then embedded in paraffin. Paraffin
sections of thickness 6 mm were prepared for hematoxylin and
eosin staining according to our previous study (Lin et al.,
2013).
2.6. Image analysis

2.2. Surgical procedure

The surgical procedure for MCAO has been described
previously (Yang & Betz, 1994). In short, rats were anestheJ. Synchrotron Rad. (2014). 21, 1314â€“1318

MR images were read and described by two experienced
radiologists using the double-blind method. The MRI intensities in the left and right masticatory muscle were counted

using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics,
Rockville, MD, USA). The normalized MRI intensity of
masticatory muscle was calculated as dividing the left masticatory muscle by the right masticatory muscle. For SR
angiography, ten consecutive images taken before contrast
enhancement were subtracted from raw images taken after
injection to eliminate the background structure. Images were
post-processed using MatLab2010a (The MathWorks Ltd,
Natick, MA, USA) to perform a temporal subtraction. To
acquire a clear general view of the rat cerebrovascular system,
the Adobe Photoshop program (Adobe, San Jose, CA) was
used to montage multi-section radiographs.
2.7. Statistical analysis

Data for the body weight were presented as mean  standard deviation (SD). The normalized MRI intensities among
different groups were compared using a two-way ANOVA
followed by Studentâ€™s t-test. A probability value of less than
5% was considered statistically significant.

3. Results
3.1. Body weight was affected by MCAO surgery

The body weight of all animals significantly decreased from
day 1 to day 3 and gradually recovered from day 7 to day 28
after MCAO (Fig. 1). This result indicates that body weight is
related to MCAO and ECA transection. Absence of apparent
masticatory muscle damage excludes the impairment to
chewing ability as an underlying cause for the weight loss.
Other factors from MCAO-induced ischemia should be
considered.
3.2. MCAO surgery did not impair blood flow to the
masticatory muscle territory

The results of T2-weighted MRI showed lower signal
density in the left masticatory muscle in rats before and 1, 7
and 28 days after MCAO with ECA transection. No hyperintense signal was found in the left masticatory muscle territory in the experimental rats. There was no statistically
significance of MRI intensity between left and right masticatory muscle, and also no significance of normalized MRI

intensity among rats before and 1, 7 and 28 days after MCAO
with ECA transection (Fig. 2).
Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed regular alignment
of smooth muscle cells in the left masticatory muscle of rats
(Fig. 2). These results indicated that the masticatory muscle
was not affected after ECA transection during the MCAO
procedure, and the body weight loss was not due to the
damage of masticatory muscle after suture-induced MCAO.
3.3. Anastomoses from the PPA to external maxillary artery
maintain blood flow of the ECA after ECA transection

SR angiography showed that the PPA and ICA were clearly
revealed in rats with or without ECA transection. Interestingly, the external maxillary artery (EMA), a major branch of
the ECA providing blood flow to the masticatory muscle, was
revealed with or without ECA transection (Fig. 3). According
to the dynamic images obtained by SR angiography, the blood
flow in the EMA was supplied from the anastomotic branch
to palatine (ABTP), indicating that collateral circulation was
established (Figs. 3 and 4).
These results suggested that the ECA territory would not
be affected after ECA transection during MCAO surgery.
Therefore, these anastomoses could maintain the integrity of
the masticatory muscle.

4. Discussion
In the current study we investigated the correlation between
intra- and extra-cranial blood supply in a rat suture MCAO
model. We demonstrated that the transection of the ECA did
not lead to injury of the masticatory muscles after MCAO. We
also provided direct in vivo evidence of anastomoses between
the PPA and the EMA (a branch of the ECA), which is
consistent with the previous meticulous work performed by
Greene nearly 80 years ago (Greene, 1936). The existence of
these collaterals accounts for the viability of the transection of
the ECA in this model.
SR angiography has been developed as an effective tool for
angiography in small animals. Studies on the circulation
alteration and blood vessel dilation of brain after ischemia
have been continuously reported in both rats and mice
(Kidoguchi et al., 2006). Here we used a T-shaped catheter that
was embedded in the CCA for injecting the contrast agent.
The T-shaped catheter enabled us to detect the vasculature
of the entire brain including the extra-cranial part without
interrupting the blood flow to the ECA territory. Regular
cannulation was usually performed by inserting a PE-10
catheter into the ECA stump, and interruption of the ECA
blood flow was inevitable with this technique. Intraluminal
suture insertion often leads to endothelium denudation,
followed by platelet aggregation and smooth muscle cells
proliferation. Surgery-related thrombosis and post-operative
stenosis presumably influence the reproducibility of suture
MCAO models (Lin et al., 2013). The emboli moved around
randomly as shown by SR angiography.

research papers
Stroke is known as a wasting disease
and cachexia after stroke has been
frequently documented clinically and
experimentally (Scherbakov et al., 2011;
Meisel et al., 2004). Weight loss can
reach up to 20% in rodent stroke
models; the cause of gradual weight loss
has yet to be revealed (Dirnagl, 2010).
Suture models of MCAO are always
accompanied by occlusion of the hypothalamic artery, which might give rise
to increased body temperature and
impaired feeding. According to our
previous experience, the high mortality
of mouse MCAO model is associated
with the variation of the posterior
communicating artery (PcomA) (Yuan
et al., 2012). Weight loss, therefore,
could be affected by the development of
the PcomA because the PcomA functioned as a major tributary to the
thalamus, hypothalamus and hippocampus when the posterior cerebral
artery was completely or partially
occluded by the suture (Coyle, 1975).
These critical structures are responsible
for body temperature adjustment and
feeding behaviors. When infarct or
under hypo-perfusion, they could
possibly result in the disparities in postoperative recovery in rat suture MCAO.
Further studies should focus on other
factors affecting animal survival in rat
suture models such as the correlation
between the diameters of the ipsilateral
PcomA and the body weight loss.
