After transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), damaging mechanisms, such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress, lead
to irreversible neurological deficits. The induction of metallothionein-II (MT-II) protein is an endogenous mechanism after I/R.
Our aim was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of MT-II after I/R in rats. Male Wistar rats were transiently occluded at the
middle cerebral artery for 2 h, followed by reperfusion. Rats received either MT (10 𝜇g per rat i.p.) or vehicle after ischemia. Lipid
peroxidation (LP) was measured 22 h after reperfusion in frontal cortex and hippocampus; also, neurological deficit was evaluated
after ischemia, using the Longa scoring scale. Infarction area was analyzed 72 hours after ischemia. Results showed increased LP
in frontal cortex (30.7%) and hippocampus (26.4%), as compared to control group; this effect was fully reversed by MT treatment.
Likewise, we also observed a diminished neurological deficit assessed by the Longa scale in those animals treated with MT compared
to control group values. The MT-treated group showed a significant (𝑃 < 0.05) reduction of 39.9% in the infarction area, only at
the level of hippocampus, as compared to control group. Results suggest that MT-II may be a novel neuroprotective treatment to
prevent ischemia injury.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a disabling condition with devastating consequences
for patients. Worldwide, it accounts for approximately 5.5
million deaths annually, with 44 million disability-adjusted
life-years lost. As associated to aging, the prevalence of stroke
is expected to increase significantly around the world [1]. This
condition, in addition to the serious health complications,
generates high costs; thus, health care for stroke survivors has
been estimated to be $18.8 billion dollars in 2008. The loss
of productivity and premature mortality are estimated at an
additional cost of $15.5 billion [2].
After transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R),
damaging events initiate as result of the suppression of energy

production caused by the interruption of oxygen and glucose
supply to brain. Excitotoxicity is the leading mechanism of
damage as a consequence of an increased release of excitatory
neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, into the extracellular
space [3]. Oxidative damage also participates in the acute
phase after I/R and is caused by excessive amounts of reactive
oxygen and nitrogen present in nervous tissue [4]. Inflammatory response is initiated as a result of the blood-brain barrier
breakdown [5]; those events trigger apoptosis [6]. Oxidative
stress is an important mechanism involved in this process, as
the antioxidant defenses are upregulated in order to cope with
the reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species. All these
free radicals damage the membrane’s fatty acids through a
deleterious process known as lipid peroxidation (LP) [7].

2
Metallothionein (MT), on the other hand, is an antioxidant thiol defense after IR. Metallothioneins are a family of
low-molecular-weight (6–7 kDa) proteins with high content
of cysteine residues and bound metal ions. The metal thiolate clusters (Scys-M-Scys) exist in two separate globular
domains, which are linked by a small lysine-rich region;
the domain in the C-terminus contains 11 cysteine residues
and is able to bind four divalent or six monovalent metals,
while the N-terminal domain contains 9 cysteine residues
capable of binding three divalent or six monovalent metals
[8]. MT functions include transport and storage of essential
transition metals, detoxification and protection against ROS,
which are important mechanisms for host defense response,
immunoregulation, cell survival, and brain repair [9]. MTIII has been located abundantly in neuronal cell bodies
in CA1-3 regions of hippocampus, dentate gyrus, cerebral
cortex, olfactory bulb, and Purkinje cells in cerebellum [10].
However, the role of MT-III in neuroprotection is controversial, since there are reports showing its neuroprotective
effect by preventing reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation,
increasing the expression of heme oxygenase-1 [11]. Also, MTIII has been described to inhibit neurite outgrowth and to
promote neuronal death [12]. On the other hand, MT-I and
MT-II are expressed in astrocytes and microglia as well as
in monocytes/macrophages [13]. The participation of MT as
a neuroprotective mechanism in cerebral ischemia has been
shown in MT-I and MT-II knockout (KO) mice submitted
to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) [14].
MT-I and MT-II KO mice showed greater neuronal damage,
as compared to wild-type mice. The exogenous administration of MT-II has shown to inhibit neuronal damage in a
model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis in rats [15] and in
a spinal cord injury model [16]. Based on this information,
we tested the ability of exogenously administered MT-II to
prevent I/R induced brain damage in rats.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals. Male Wistar rats weighing 250–300 g were
maintained under standard laboratory conditions and had
free access to food and water. The protocols for animal use
were approved by the Animals Ethics Committee of the
National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery of Mexico.
2.2. Surgery. We used the MCA occlusion experimental
model of focal cerebral ischemia reported by Longa et al. [17]
modified to achieve reperfusion 2 h after ischemia. Animals
were anesthetized with 3% halothane using a facemask. Body
temperature was maintained at 37∘ C with a warm pad during
the surgical procedure and afterward until the recovery of
rats from anesthesia. A longitudinal incision was made in
the middle of the ventral cervical skin. The right common
carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, and right external
carotid artery were exposed. The distal portion of the right
external carotid artery was then ligated and cut. A nylon
suture (3–0) was introduced into the lumen of the right
external carotid toward the internal carotid. The suture was
advanced 17 mm into the right internal carotid and left there.

Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
Finally, the incision was closed and left under controlled
conditions for 2 h. After this time, the reperfusion started by
opening the wound to retract the filament, which was pulled
out completely. Immediately after reperfusion, rats were
evaluated for neurological deficits using the scale described
by Longa et al. [17].
2.3. Pharmacological Treatments. Rats were randomly allocated into four groups as follows: group 1: sham operation
plus vehicle, group 2: two hours of ischemia and reperfusion
plus vehicle (saline solution, 0.9% NaCl), and group 3: two
hours of ischemia and reperfusion exogenously administered
with 2 i.p. doses of 10 𝜇g per rat MT-II dissolved in saline
solution (metallothionein-II from rabbit liver, Sigma M9542),
according to Arellano-Ruiz et al. [16]. MT-II was selected
on the basis of the stability of the protein. MT-II half-life in
adult animals is 21–33 hours, while the half-life of MT-I is
shorter. This may indicate that MT-I is more susceptible to
degradation than MT-II [18]. All animals received two doses
of vehicle or MT at 30 min and 8 hr after ischemia. These
times were chosen on the basis of the therapeutic window for
Stroke.
2.4. Reagents Lipid Peroxidation Assay. Quinine 90% was
purchased from Sigma Aldrich; chloroform and methanol of
HPLC grade were purchased from Merck Chemicals.
2.5. Lipid Peroxidation Assay. Lipid fluorescence products’
formation was measured after ischemia and reperfusion by
using the technique described by Triggs and Willmore [19],
modified by Santamaria and Rios [20]. All animals were
sacrificed 24 hr after ischemia, the time of peak levels of lipid
peroxidation (LP) reported by Thiyagarajan and Shrama [21].
Rats were killed by decapitation, and their frontal cortex and
hippocampus (both ipsilateral and contralateral to the injury)
were dissected out, according to Iversen and Glowinski
[22]. Tissues were weighed and homogenized in 3 mL of
cold 0.9% NaCl solution. One-milliliter aliquots from the
homogenate were added to 4 mL of a chloroform-methanol
mixture (2 : 1 v/v). After stirring, the mixture was ice-cooled
for 30 min to allow phase separation and the fluorescence of
the chloroform layer was measured in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B
Luminescence spectrophotometer at 370 nm of excitation
and 430 nm emission wavelengths. The sensitivity of the
spectrophotometer was adjusted to 150 units of fluorescence
with a quinine standard solution (0.1 g/mL). Results were
expressed as fluorescence units/g of wet tissue.
2.6. Behavioral Assessment. In this study, we determine
neurological deficit using the functional scale described by
Longa et al. [17]. This scale was standardized specifically
for the model of ischemia/reperfusion used, and injury
is functionally evaluated mainly as motor deficits present
after damage. Brain regional-specific functional alterations
were not evaluated here, as we expected a more general
protection with the treatments. All animals were evaluated
2, 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after reperfusion to record the
presence or absence of neurological signs in rats as follows:

Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity
0: no observable deficit, 1: forelimb flexion, 2: unidirectional
circling, 3: falling to the contralateral injury side, 4: decreased
level or lack of consciousness, and 5: death after surgery. All
animals were allocated in individual acrylic cages with sterile
sawdust and received food and water ad libitum.
2.7. Morphometric Analysis at the Level of Hippocampus.
Seventy-two hours after ischemia, all animals were anesthetized by i.p. injection of pentobarbital. Then, 1 mL of heparin was administered, and rats were perfused transcardially
with 10% buffered formalin. The brains were removed from
the skull cut with a matrix (coronal rodent brain matrix,
EMS) at 2 mm thick and embedded in paraffin. Coronary
sections 10 𝜇m thick were obtained containing cortex and
hippocampus. Those regions were selected using the Paxinos
and Watson stereotaxic atlas (Bregma −2.40 to Bregma −2.64)
[23]. After staining with hematoxylin-eosin, the area of
ischemia was determined, according to the method described
by Niyaz et al. [24]. Tissue slides (one per rat) were digitized
using a computerized system equipped with IM500 software
and a 300 FX digital camera. Area analysis was performed
with an Image Database V.4.01 (Leica) and a CCD-IRIS Sony
camera, using morphometric assessment. All histological
preparations were assessed by a pathologist blind to the
treatments. Results were expressed as percentage of tissue
damage of cortical tissue.
2.8. Statistical Analysis. Results of LP are expressed as mean
± S.E.M. Statistical significance between groups was determined by analysis of variance, followed by Tukey’s test, after
testing for homogeneity of variances. Statistical significance
between contralateral and ipsilateral cortex and hippocampus
values was determined using paired 𝑡-test.
Significant differences in Longa scores were determined
using the repeated-measures ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s
test. Finally, the results of morphometric data were analyzed
using Student’s 𝑡-test for independent samples. All statistical
analyses were performed using the SPSS 19.0 software.

3. Results
3.1. Metallothionein II Inhibits Lipid Peroxidation in Frontal
Cortex and Hippocampus after Transient Cerebral I/R in
Rats. Figure 1 shows the effect of exogenously administered
metallothionein-II on LP assessed 24 h after ischemia, which
was evaluated both on the contralateral side as in the
ipsilateral side of I/R. Figure 1(a) shows the mean ± one
S.E.M. of 7 to 10 animals per group tested, measured in the
frontal cortex, and Figure 1(b) shows the results obtained in
the hippocampus. The results are expressed in fluorescence
units per gram of wet tissue (UF/g wet tissue).
LP values at frontal cortex level in the contralateral side
were 140.81 ± 13.71, 136.83 ± 8.76, and 131.56 ± 14.46 for
sham group, I/R group, and I/R+MT-II group, respectively.
As observed, the average values are similar in all groups
without significant differences. While the ipsilateral side is
damaged, data observed were 136.41 ± 15.38, 178.27 ± 17.35,

3
and 112.14 ± 13.35 for the sham group, I/R group, and I/RMII group, respectively, showing a significant increase in the
LP by I/R of 30.7%, when compared to the sham group.
Treatment with MT-II decreased those values to the levels
of the sham group. This reduction was statistically significant
(∗ 𝑃 < 0.05).
Likewise, the LP data in the contralateral side to I/R
hippocampus showed similar results in all groups (162.29 ±
22.55, 170.02 ± 18.44, and 143.14 ± 26.33 for the sham group,
I/R group, and I/RMT-II group, resp.), while the values on
the ipsilateral side, LP indicates baseline levels in the sham
group of 165.8 ± 16.26 which are lower than those observed
in the tissue by the effect of I/R (209.58 ± 17.95) that were
statistically different (𝑃 < 0.05). Again, MT-II treated rats
showed diminished values (I/RMT-II group) of 136.44±11.61
when compared to I/R group (𝑃 < 0.05).
3.2. Metallothionein-II Treatment Reduces Neurological
Deficits after Transient Cerebral I/R in Rats. Figure 2 shows
the effect of MT-II treatment on functional recovery after
cerebral I/R assessed by the Longa scale. High scores in these
neurological scales correspond to a greater neurological
deficit. The global neurological test scale provides a more
general indication of neurological differences between
control (I/R) and I/R MT-II groups. The mean values of I/R
group animals were 1.85 ± 0.15 at 2 h and 1.08 ± 0.3 at 72
hours after ischemia. These results indicate little recovery of
the animals. Meanwhile, animals in the group I/R plus MT-II
showed mean values of 1.54 ± 0.24 at 2 h and of 0.23 ± 0.06 at
72 h after ischemia (𝑃 < 0.05). When comparing functional
recovery of animals at the end of the study (72 hours), we
observed a greater functional recovery of 78.7% in the group
of animals receiving I/R plus MT-II, as compared to animals
receiving I/R only; this difference was statistically significant
(𝑃 < 0.05).
3.3. Metallothionein-II Diminished the Damaged Area after
Transient Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion. Figure 3
shows representative photomicrographs of transient
cerebral ischemia and reperfusion evaluated at the level of
hippocampus. As clearly seen, there is a greater amount of
damaged tissue in animals receiving I/R plus vehicle, when
compared with the group of animals receiving I/R plus MT-II
treatment. Likewise, Figure 4 shows the quantitation of the
tissue damage performed 72 hours after I/R. Values are given
in percentage of tissue damage with respect to 100% of brain
tissue in the slide. The amount of tissue damage in animals
receiving I/R and treated with vehicle was 11.58 ± 1.39,
as compared to values from the group receiving I/R plus
MT-II treatment (6.96 ± 1.23); this difference was statistically
significant (𝑃 < 0.05).

4. Discussion
In the present work, we demonstrated that the administration
of exogenous MT-II decreases oxidative damage, evaluated
as the production of lipid fluorescent products (LP), both in
hippocampus and frontal cortex. In addition, this treatment

promoted functional recovery and reduced the amount of
damaged tissue after transient cerebral I/R in rats, but only
at the level of hippocampus. The antioxidant effect of MTI/II
also has been tested in primary cortical neuron/astrocyte cultures from neonatal MT-I/II deficient (MT−/− ) and wild-type
(MT+/+ ) mice against NMDA-mediated injury. The findings

showed that MT-I/II expression was increased by NMDA in
MT+/+ cultures but was not detectable in MT−/− cultures.
NMDA concentration dependently induced oxidative injury
in both MT+/+ and MT−/− cultures as evidenced by decreased
cell viability, increased lipid peroxidation, and DNA damage.
However, these toxic effects were greater in MT−/− than values of MT+/+ cultures. NMDA significantly increased reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation and disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential in neurons in MT+/+ cultures,
and these effects were exacerbated in MT−/− cultures; these
results showed that basal MT-I/II provides protection against
NMDA-mediated oxidative injury [25]. It is important to note
the relationship between oxidative damage mediated by the
activation of NMDA-R and neuroprotection exerted by MTI/II, as both mechanisms (excitotoxicity and oxidative stress)
are remarkably important in the acute phase after I/R.
The neuroprotective effect of MT-I/II has been observed
in several models of brain damage. Trendelenburg et al.
[13] applied serial analysis of gene expression to study
differentially expressed genes in mice brains 14 hours after the
induction of focal cerebral ischemia and demonstrated that
metallothionein-II (MT-II) was the most significantly upregulated transcript in the ischemic hemisphere. That upregulation of both MT-I and MT-II was confirmed by Northern
blotting. MT-I and MT-II mRNA expression increased as
early as 2 hours after transient ischemia, with a maximum
after 16 hours. Likewise, an immunohistochemistry study
revealed that MT-I/-II is localized in astrocytes as well as
in monocytes/macrophages [13]. Taken together, all those
results pointed out the neuroprotective role of metallothioneins in ischemic damage of the brain. Finally, Prado et al.
[26] demonstrated that presence of MT-I/II after induction

of cortical cryolesion in wild-type and MT-I/II deficient mice
is responsible for neuroprotection; the authors examined the
effect of administration of the selective phosphodiesterase-5

inhibitor sildenafil (10 mg/kg) 2 h before and 24 and 48 h after
damage. The results showed that, in wild-type animals, sildenafil induces similar changes in glial reactivity, angiogenesis,
and antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects in the cryolesioned
cortex as those observed in rats with Zaprinast (nonselective cGMP-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibitor),
indicating that inhibition of PDE5 is responsible for the
neuroprotective actions. However, these effects were not
observed in MT-I/II deficient mice. Likewise, they showed
that sildenafil significantly increases MT-I/II protein levels
in the lesioned cortex and MT-I/II immunostaining in glial
cells around the lesion. Taken together, these results indicate
that cGMP-mediated pathways regulate expression of MTI/II and support the involvement of these proteins in the
neuroprotective effects of sildenafil in focal brain lesions.
Some other authors have found a lack of neuroprotection
against I/R-induced damage of MT-I and MT-II null mice;
however, they used a neonatal model of damage, and, thus,
the inherent differences between developing and mature
brains may account for the lack of protection observed by
authors [27]. There is strong evidence of the neuroprotective
effect of MT-II in various models of nervous system damage
when its expression is induced; however, there is scarce information regarding the pharmacological use of exogenously
administered MT. An interesting finding of the present study

6
is that, only at the level of hippocampus, among all other
brain regions examined, showed a significant protection by
MT-II, as observed by histological markers (Figure 3). This
is probably due to the abundance of zinc and MT-II basal
expression in that brain region [28]. The mechanism through
which MT-II exerts its protective effect when exogenously
administered has not been elucidated; however, there is evidence that this protein can be carried by the megalin receptor,
a known multiligand, endocytic receptor with significant
physiological function. It is expressed primarily in polarized
epithelial cells and, with a few exceptions, it is located in
the apical membranes, with a molecular weight 6kDa; it is
expressed in the choroid plexus ependymal cells that line the
cerebral ventricles in central nervous system [29]. Recently,
Lewis et al. [30] analyzed the distribution of MT-IIA when
administered exogenously by intraperitoneal or intramuscular injections in metallothionein deficient mice. The results
showed that MT-IIA was detected within epithelial cells of
the kidney cortical and medullary tubules within 1 h of either
intramuscular or intraperitoneal injection. Additionally, MTIIA was detected in the urine 1 h after injection, indicating a
rapid absorption into the circulation and filtration through
the kidney glomerulus. A portion of the intramuscularly
injected MT-IIA remained within the muscle for at least
24 hours after injection. No MT-IIA was observed in the
liver nor in the brain after either a single injection or a
series of MT-IIA injections. This is probably due to the
exclusion of MT-IIA through the intact blood-brain barrier
(BBB), although a receptor for MT-I/II (megalin) is present
in the choroid plexus. In our model of I/R, BBB is broken
and remains permeable to blood products for several hours
[31]. The neuroprotective effect of exogenously MT-I/II given
intraperitoneally to rats in experimental models where BBB
is decreased [9, 15], like I/R, offers a pharmacological opportunity to test the neuroprotective abilities of the protein.
