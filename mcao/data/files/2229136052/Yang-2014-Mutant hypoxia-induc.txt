Abstract. Hypoxia‑inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) plays stimulatory roles in revascularization in the ischemic area of cerebral
ischemia. However, the hydroxylation of proline at 564 and
asparagine at 803 in the HIF1α coding sequence facilitated the
degradation of HIF1α and inhibited the transcription activity of
the HIF1α promoter under normoxic conditions and confined
the pro‑angiogenic efficacy of HIF1α. In the present study, the
HIF1α mutant containing P564A and N803A was constructed
by site‑directed mutagenesis. Rat bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells (BMSCs) were infected with adenoviral particles
containing HIF1α mutant at multiplicity of infection of 150. The
HIF1α mRNA and protein levels under hypoxia and normoxic
conditions were compared using reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. To explore the
therapeutic effect of mutant HIF1α on the cerebral ischemia,
BMSCs overexpressing mutant HIF1α were transplanted in
the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO). The
motor function and cerebral infarct size were evaluated using
modified neurological severity score and triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) staining within four weeks after MCAO.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expression
was detected by western blot analysis. Microvessel density
and angiogenesis were detected by immunohistochemistry
to evaluate the recovery of the brain ischemia. The HIF1α
mutant containing P564A and N803A could be expressed
under normoxic conditions. Transplantation of BMSCs stably
expressing mutant HIF1α significantly improved motor function, reduced cerebral infarction and increased VEGF protein
expression revascularization at days 7, 14 and 28 (P<0.05).
Therefore, the HIF1α mutant containing P564A and N803A
may be a potential target for the treatment of the cerebral
ischemia.

Introduction
Ischemic cerebrovascular disease is caused by cerebral
vascular stenosis or occlusion leading to cerebral ischemia or
thrombosis, which accounts for 70‑80% of all cerebrovascular
disease. How to prevent secondary brain injury following cerebral ischemia is currently of interest in clinical and scientific
research. Previous studies indicate that angiogenesis is one
of the key factors in the recovery of secondary brain injury.
Hypoxia‑inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) plays an important role
in angiogenesis (1‑4). HIF1α promotes angiogenesis without
causing blood vessel leakage, tissue edema and inflammatory
reaction (5), and is considered a promising therapeutic target
for clinical treatments.
HIF1α is an important transcription factor and a functional
subunit. Its protein stability and transcriptional activity are
mainly regulated by the intracellular oxygen concentration (6,7). HIF1α facilitates cell survival under hypoxic
conditions by binding to the hypoxia response element in the
target gene and regulates the expression of broad spectrum
of angiogenesis‑related genes, including vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF). As a result, VEGF promotes the
angiogenesis and revascularization, and improves the blood
supply (8‑10). However, HIF1α is only expressed under hypoxia
conditions and degraded rapidly under normoxic conditions
due to the hydroxylation of the 564‑proline and 803‑asparagine in the coding sequences (CDS). Hydroxylation of the
564‑proline causes HIF1α degradation by the oxygen‑dependent degradation domain (ODDD) (11‑14). The 803‑asparagine
in the C‑terminal region (COOH‑terminal transactivation
domain, CAD) determines the HIF1α transcriptional activity.
The prevention of 803‑asparagine hydroxylation with chemical
inhibitors or genetic recombination can induce strong transcription activity of HIF1α (15).
Thus far, there are few studies that focus on the treatment
of cerebral ischemia using mutant HIF1α‑transfected BMSCs.
In the present study, the 564‑proline and 803‑asparagine in the
CDS were simultaneously mutated into alanine and the mutant
HIF1α recombinant adenovirus vector was constructed.
The HIF1α gene recombinant vector was transfected into
BMSCs (16), and subsequently the infected BMSCs were
transplanted to the middle cerebral artery occlusion model
(MCAO) to achieve high levels of HIF1α protein expression
and promote revascularization in the ischemic area.

old) were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of
Liaoning Medical College (Jinzhou, Liaoning, China). All the
experimental procedures were carried out according to the
internationally accredited guidelines with the approval of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Drug Safety
Evaluation Center of Liaoning Medical College.

Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA); pMD19‑T and reverse
transcription‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) kit were
purchased from Takara Bio, Inc. (Otsu, Japan); PmeI and PacI
were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Ipswich,
MA, USA); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM),
trypsin and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from
Gibco Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA); anti‑HIF1α
(rabbit; no. 10790), anti‑VEGF (rabbit; no. 507), anti‑cluster of
differentiation 105 (CD105) (rabbit; no. 20632), anti‑β‑actin
(no. 130656) and the corresponding secondary antibodies
[horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‑conjugated; no. 2004] were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA); 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium chloride was purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA); and the HEK293A cells
were purchased from the Type Culture Collection of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).
Infection of BMSCs with recombinant adenovirus. The recombinant adenovirus vector was introduced into the HEK293A
cells for packaging and infectious viral particles were
obtained. Rats BMSCs were isolated and purified according
to the adhesion method. BMSCs were cultured in low‑glucose
DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37˚C, 5% CO2. The cells were infected (multiplicity
of infection=150) and the infection efficiency was observed
under fluorescence microscope after 72 h of infection.
Animal middle cerebral artery occlusion model and bone
marrow mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. Forty‑eight
adult SD rats were randomly divided into four groups. The
suture occlusion method was used, as previously described by
Longa et al (17). In brief, a 0.2‑mm suture was inserted into the
external carotid artery with a depth of 18.0±0.5 mm to occlude
the entrance of the right middle cerebral artery to induce ischemia. Two hours after the occlusion, the suture was removed
to create a reperfusion model. The rats were randomly divided
into four groups and 5x106 BMSCs were injected via the tail
vein 6 h after MCAO (18).
Evaluation of the cerebral infarction and functional
outcome. Functional outcome was evaluated by the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) (19). The higher the
mNSS score, the more severe the neurological dysfunction.
Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was carried out
at days 1, 14 and 28 after MCAO. The rats were sacrificed and
the brains were collected. The coronal sections (2 mm) were

1623

incubated in 2% TTC solution at 37˚C for 15 min. The relative
infarct volume was calculated based on methods described by
Neumann‑Haefelin et al (20).
RT‑PCR. Total RNA was extracted using using TRIzol
(Invitrogen Life Technologies). The optical density (OD)
260/OD280 values were measured by UV spectrophotometer
to assess the quality of the RNA. RNA was subsequently
reverse‑transcribed into cDNA by RT‑PCR. The thermal
cycler parameters were 95˚C, 3 min; 94˚C, 30 sec, 59˚C, 30 sec,
72˚C, 45 sec, 36 cycles; and 72˚C, 7 min; prior to storage at
4˚C. Following the reaction, 5 µl of PCR product for each cell
sample was used for 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. The OD
of each band was analyzed by a gel imaging system (I-box;
UVP, Upland, CA, USA). The experiment was carried out in
triplicate and the relative OD values were independently
calculated. The primers used for PCR amplification were as
follows: 564 forward, CTGGCCGCAGCCGCTGGAGACAC;
and reverse, GGATATAGGCAGCTAACATCTCC; 803,
GATGTTAGCTGCCTATATCCCAATG; and reverse, TTCA

TATGACCTGC; and reverse, GTCGTGCTGAATAA
TACCACTC; β ‑actin forward, GGGACCTGACTGACTA
CCTC; and reverse, TCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGAT.
Immunohistochemistry. The rats were decapitated and the
right brain hemispheres were collected. The tissues were fixed,
dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at the coronal
plane. The sections were then incubated with rabbit anti‑mouse
CD105 factor antibody (1:200) for immunohistochemical
staining. Following the 3,3'-diaminobenzidine reaction, the
sections were stained with hematoxylin. Microvessel density
(MVD) was calculated based on the method described in the
study by Weidener et al (21). A brown‑stained single endothelial cell (or endothelial cell cluster) was used as a vessel
count; six fields on each slice were randomly selected for
the microvessel count. The number of vessels per unit (mm2)
(microvessel density) was calculated and averaged.
Western blot analysis. The total protein was extracted. Equal
amounts of protein (50 µg) were separated by 10% SDS‑PAGE
and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The
membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed dry milk for 1 h
at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody
[anti‑HIF1α (rabbit) or anti‑VEGF (rabbit), 1:1,000] at 4˚C
overnight. The membranes were washed and incubated with
the HRP‑conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room
temperature. Subsequent to washing, the membranes were
incubated in developing solution in a dark room for 30 min at
room temperature. The expression levels of targeted protein
were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and analyzed
using Quantity One (Bio‑Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The
experiment was carried out in triplicate and the relative OD
values were calculated.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the means ± standard deviation. One‑way analysis of variance was used to
analyze the difference among groups. P<0.05 was considered
to indicate a statistically significant difference.

Results
Infection of BMSCs with the recombinant adenovirus parti‑
cles. As shown in Fig. 1A‑D, DNA sequencing assay showed
that the proline at 564 and the asparagine at 803 of HIF1α were
mutated into alanine. A 30‑ and a 3‑kb band were observed
following PacІ cleavage (Fig. 1E). This mutant was transfected

into HEK293A cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Fig. 1F). The
infectious recombinant adenovirus particles were harvested
and the titer was 2.1x109 pfu/ml. Subsequently, the BMSCs
were infected using these virus particles containing P564A
and N803A, and the infectious status was observed by an

fluorescent protein (Fig. 2) indicating that mutant HIF1α can
be expressed at high level under nomorxic conditions.
The expression of mutant HIF1α were quantitatively
examined in BMSCs at mRNA and protein levels under
normoxic conditions. RT‑PCR showed that the expression
of mutant HIF1α mRNA could be detected under normoxic
conditions (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis revealed that the
mutant HIF1α protein was only detected under normoxic
conditions. These data further indicated that the HIF1α
mutant could be expressed under normoxic conditions as
compared to HIF1α, which is only expressed under hypoxia
conditions (Fig. 3B).

Mutant HIF1α improves the functional outcome and
decreases the infarct size. The mutant‑HIF1α therapy
outcomes in rats were evaluated using the mNSS on days 1,
7, 14, 21 and 28. A lower mNSS score indicates that less
neurological defects resulted from MCAO and represents
a more improved outcome. As shown in Fig. 4A, there was
a significant improvement in neurological function in the
mutant‑HIF1α group compared to the other three groups from
days 14‑28 (P<0.05). However, no significant difference were
observed in all the groups at day 1 and day 7 after MCAO
(P>0.05). The mNSS score was significantly lower in the
mutant HIF1α group than the other three groups at day 14

(P<0.05), whereas the scores were similar among the other
three groups (P<0.05). Compared to the other groups, the
scores of the mutant‑HIF1α group decreased more significantly at day 21 and day 28, indicating that the mutant HIF1α
could effectively mitigate motor function (P<0.05) (Fig. 4A).
Compared to the other groups, TTC staining showed that the
infarcted area decreased significantly in the mutant‑HIF1α
groups. This indicated that mutant HIF1α could attenuate
cerebral ischemic injury in rats. The infarct area (white
area) was similar among all the groups at day 1 (P<0.05).
On day 14, the infarct size in the mutant‑HIF1α group was
significantly reduced, compared to the other three groups
(P<0.05); at day 28, the reduction in the infarct size became
clearer in comparison to the other groups (P<0.05), indicating
that mutant HIF1α effectively reduced ischemic injury in rats
(Fig. 4B and C).

VEGF protein expression and revasculation in the mutant
group. Western blot analysis showed that VEGF protein
expression was significantly higher in the mutant‑HIF1α group
than the other three groups (P<0.05), indicating that the mutant
HIF1α significantly increased the expression of the downstream
gene, VEGF, which was consistent with the mutant‑HIF1α
function under normoxic conditions (Fig. 5).
The number of new blood vessels at the ischemia areas
were also evaluated at the same time. For the wild‑type HIF1α
group, a small amount of scattered microvascular could be
observed at 7 days after cerebral ischemia. The revasculation
peaked at day 14 after ischemia and subsequently decreased
gradually. Whereas, the mutant‑HIF1α group showed that
the density of neomicrovascular vessels was denser at day 7,
peaked at day 14 and maintained at a relatively higher level at
day 28 after MCAO (Fig. 6).

Discussion
In the present study, a recombinant adenovirus HIF1α was
established in which the proline at 564 and asparagine at 803
were mutated simultaneously and explored the significance
in the clinical treatment of cerebral ischemia. Numerous
data have demonstrated that the evidence indicates that the
564‑proline and the 803‑asparagine are important loci that
regulate HIF1α expression. The 564‑proline in the ODDD of
HIF1α is degraded by proline hydroxylase and hydroxylation of
the 803‑asparagine can inhibit HIF1α transcriptional activity
under normoxic conditions (11‑15). For these reasons, HIF1α
accumulates only under hypoxia conditions. In the present
study, the P to A mutation at 564 prevented oxygen‑dependent degradation of HIF1α and the N to A mutation of the
803‑asparagine increased transcriptional activity of HIF1α,
which all lead to a stable HIF1α expression under normoxic
conditions. The present data have demonstrated that the
mutant HIF1α could be expressed at a relatively higher level
under normoxic conditions. In addition, the mutant HIF1α is
more stable compared to wild‑type HIF1α under normoxic
conditions with a higher expression level without degradation.
HIF1α mRNA expression, but not protein expression,
was found under normoxic conditions, which indicates
that wild‑type HIF1α protein can be completely degraded
under normoxic conditions. However, the mutant HIF1α
was expressed under normoxic conditions. These data indicated that the degradation of wild‑type HIF1α occurs at the
post‑transcriptional translation stage.
BMSCs were infected with adenovirus particles containing
the mutant‑HIF1α gene in vitro and found that transfection
with the mutant HIF1α effectively induced the expression of
HIF1α under normoxic conditions, which provided a foundation for our in vivo animal experiments. In addition, VEGF
protein expression in the animals treated with BMSCs
overexpressing the mutant HIF1α were significantly higher
than that of the animals treated with BMSCs overexpressing
the wild‑type HIF1α. VEGF is a HIF1α‑downstream gene,
indicating that mutant HIF1α is not only expressed under
normoxic conditions, but also effectively promotes downstream gene expression, including VEGF, which is consistent
with the wild‑type HIF1α function under hypoxic conditions.
Immunohistochemistry results showed that the MVD was
significantly higher in the animals treated with BMSCs overexpressing the mutant HIF1α at days 7, 14 and 28 compared to
the other three groups, indicating that mutant HIF1α promoted
angiogenesis and revascularization in the cerebral ischemia
area, thereby accelerate the process of motor function recovery.
Correspondingly, the infarct volume was significantly reduced
in the animals treated with BMSCs overexpressing the mutant
HIF1α than that of the animals treated with BMSCs overexpressing the wild‑type HIF1α, which is consistent with the
behavioral test results (22‑24).
A previous study has shown that mutant HIF1α protein can
be efficiently expressed in vitro and in vivo under normoxic
conditions, which accelerates the angiogenesis and the formation of microvessel system, improve local blood supply and
thus, facilitate blood perfusion to ischemic brain tissue (25).
Wild‑type HIF1α is unstable in a complex in vivo environment
and less effective in promoting in vivo angiogenesis. In the

1627

present study, the unknown consequence of gene mutation was
not encountered. The results showed that mutant HIF1α has
generated new potential for the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
Numerous data have demonstrated that rat bone marrow
mesenchymal stem cells can pass the blood brain barrier (26‑29).
In the present study, mutant‑HIF1α infected‑BMSCs was
injected into into rats and the BMSCs passed through the
blood‑brain barrier and achieved therapeutic effects. However,
due to the limited experimental conditions, the amount of
HIF1α that successfully transferred into brain tissue was
not measured. This area requires exploring further in future
studies.
