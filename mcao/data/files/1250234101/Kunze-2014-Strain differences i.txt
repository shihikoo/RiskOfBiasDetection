Abstract Fatigue and depression are common symptoms
after stroke. Animal models of poststroke fatigue (PSF) and
poststroke depression (PSD) would facilitate the study of
these symptoms. Spontaneous locomotor activity is as an
objective measure of fatigue and learned helplessness an
accepted correlate of depression. We used different rat strains
to evaluate stroke-induced changes in behavior in hopes that
interstrain differences would provide insights into the biological basis of these symptoms. Male Lewis, Wistar, and
Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats underwent experimental stroke.
Spontaneous activity was assessed continually after stroke
(for up to 50 days). In a subset of animals, the forced swim
test was performed prior to and 1 month after stroke to assess
learned helplessness; blood was obtained at sacrifice for cytokine assay. Stroke induced strain-related differences in activity; Lewis rats increased spontaneous activity during the
dark cycle, while Wistar and SD rats increased activity during
the light cycle. The velocity of movement decreased during
the dark cycle in Wistar and SD rats and during the light cycle
in Lewis rats. Stroke also led to an increase in learned helplessness in Lewis rats. In summary, different patterns of
behaviors emerge in different rat strains after stroke. Lewis
rats displayed behavior consistent with depression but not
fatigue, while Wistar and SD rats displayed behavior consistent
with fatigue but not depression. These data argue that PSF and
PSD are different biological constructs and suggest that analysis
of strain-related differences may provide insight into symptom
pathophysiology.

Depression and fatigue are common symptoms following
stroke and both are associated with decreased quality of life
[1–3]. At least one third of patients who suffer stroke report
depression or fatigue in the poststroke period [4–7]. Despite
the frequency with which depression and fatigue occur following stroke, the biological underpinnings of these symptoms are unknown. Many depressed individuals complain of
fatigue, but individuals with poststroke fatigue (PSF) are not
universally depressed as most studies demonstrate a much
higher rate of PSF than poststroke depression (PSD) [3, 1,
2]. The fact that effective treatment of depression does not
eliminate fatigue in stroke survivors also argues that these
symptoms have a different pathophysiology [8, 9].
Both inflammation and dysregulation of the hypothalamicpituitary axis are implicated in the pathophysiology of fatigue
and depression [10, 11]. The goal of the current study was to
develop an animal model to facilitate the study of PSF and
PSD and to explore the potential contribution of inflammation
to these symptoms. Using an automated system
(EthoVision®), spontaneous activity in the home cage
(Noldus Phenoytper®) after stroke was assessed as a measure
of PSF. Depression was evaluated using the forced swim test
(FST), which relies on the concept of learned helplessness;
“depressed” animals cease efforts to escape (i.e., become
immobile) much sooner than animals without depression
[12–14].
For this study, we chose strains that have different propensities for developing inflammatory/immune-mediated diseases to determine if these differences would correlate with
measures of fatigue and depression. Specifically, inbred Lewis
rats are susceptible to immune-mediated diseases such as
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis while outbred

Sprague–Dawley (SD) and Wistar rats are relatively resistant
to EAE [15, 16]. Capitalizing on strain-related differences in
the response to stroke among these three strains, we hoped to
gain insight into PSF and PSD.

Methods
Animals
Lewis rats were purchased from Taconic Farms; Wistar and
SD rats were purchased from Charles River Labs. Animals
weighed between 325 and 375 g at baseline. All experiments
were approved by the University of Washington Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Anesthesia was induced with 5 % and maintained with
1 % isoflurane. After midline neck incision, the right
common carotid, external carotid, and pterygopalatine
arteries were ligated. A 4.0 monofilament suture
(Doccol) was inserted into the common carotid artery
and advanced into the internal carotid artery to occlude
the origin of the middle cerebral artery. Animals were
maintained at normothermia during surgery and reperfused 2 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). In sham-operated animals, the filament was
inserted into the carotid but not advanced. Rectal temperature was assessed at 2, 3, and 6 h, as well as each
day for the first week following MCAO and then
during weekly behavioral testing for the remainder of
the study period for each group. Body weight was
assessed daily for the first week and then weekly thereafter. One cohort of animals was sacrificed at 1 month
after MCAO and a second cohort was survived for at
least 50 days after stroke onset. A separate cohort of
animals underwent MCAO and was sacrificed at 24 h
to determine infarct size (Lewis, N =10; Wistar, N =10;
SD, N= 11).
Infarct Volume
At the time of sacrifice, brains were removed, chilled at −20°
at 30 min and sectioned at 2 mm intervals. Sections were
incubated in 2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
(Sigma) at 38 °C for 15 min. (In our experience, briefly
chilling the brains helps to preserve infarcted tissue and aids
in sectioning; TTC is still reduced to formazin.) Brain sections
were scanned and digitized. Infarct volume was determined
using ImageJ software [17] and corrected for the presence of
edema [18].

Behavioral Outcomes
The neurological score of recipient animals was determined at
multiple time points after MCAO using a modification of the
Bederson scale [19]. Animals were trained on the rotarod for
five sessions over 5 days prior to MCAO. After MCAO,
rotarod performance was assessed weekly. Performance of
the foot fault test was also assessed at these time points and
the results expressed as a percentage of foot faults per total
number of steps taken over a period of 3 min [20].
Forced Swim Test
A subset of animals was subjected to the FST prior to MCAO
and again prior to sacrifice at 1 month. For this test, each rat
was placed in a beaker of water (28 °C) from which they could
not escape and observed for 10 min. Activity was video
recorded and analyzed using the Noldus Ethovision® software
to determine the latency to and the total duration of immobility.
Home Cage System
To measure the spontaneous/voluntary activity of the rats, the
Noldus Ethovision® home cage system was used. This system
utilizes an infrared light source and infrared camera installed
in the top of each custom Plexiglas home cage, allowing for
continuous remote monitoring of rats regardless of ambient
light conditions. Each home cage was equipped with a running wheel, shelter, feeder, and water. The Ethovision® software was set up to divide the cage floor into zones (running
wheel [RW] zone, shelter, and open cage floor), such that
activity in each zone could be analyzed separately. Video
was saved automatically into a computer for analysis. For
the purposes of this manuscript, the following data were
collected: distance moved on the open cage floor (cm), median and maximal velocity (cm/s) of movement on the open
cage floor, time spent in the shelter, time spent in the RW zone
and the number of rotations on the RW. All data represent the
median value of the indicated measurement per hour. For ease
of analysis, data were parsed into 5-day “epochs”, and the
median value for each epoch used for statistical analyses.
The vivarium was maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark
cycle (0600/1800 hours). Rats were acclimated to the home
cage system for at 5–7 days prior to MCAO. Animals were
removed from home cages for MCAO (or sham surgery) and
placed back in the home cages one day later for continuous
monitoring thereafter (with the exception of weekly behavioral testing).
Histology
At sacrifice, brains were removed, postfixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 24 h, saturated in 30 % sucrose for 48 h, placed

606

in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, flash frozen
in dry ice cooled isopentane and stored at −80 °C until sectioning. Coronal sections (20 μm) were taken from Bregma +
1.70, −0.40, and −1.80 mm and stained with cresyl violet. The
area of the ischemic and non-ischemic hemispheres at each
level was determined using Image J. Atrophy of ischemic
hemisphere is expressed as the percent of the hemisphere lost
relative to the non-ischemic hemisphere.
Cytokine Analyses
Plasma was obtained at the time of sacrifice and frozen
at −80 °C until use. Cytokine concentrations were determined
using a Luminex Platform® and reagents from Novex®. The
cytokines and (sensitivities) are as follows: interleukin (IL-1)α
(5 pg/mL), IL-1β (1 pg/mL), IL-10 (15 pg/mL), IL-12 (10 pg/
mL), and IL-2 (25 pg/mL). Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1ra) was assessed using standard ELISA (US Biological); the
lower limit of sensitivity was 12 pg/mL. For cytokines that were
undetectable, the lower limit of sensitivity was used for analyses.

spend virtually all of their time in the shelter during the light
cycle. Activity levels among strains are similar during the dark
cycle, although SD rats tend to move more slowly than the
other strains. And in comparison to Lewis and Wistar rats, SD
rats spend more time in the shelter during the light/inactive
cycle.
Following stroke, Lewis rats demonstrate increased activity
during the dark cycle; this increase in activity is evidenced by
an increase in the distance moved each hour, an increase in the
time spent in the running wheel zone, an increase in the
number of revolutions on the running wheel and a decrease
in the time spent in the shelter (Fig. 1). Wistar and SD rats, on
the other hand, exhibit a decrease in the velocity of movements
in the dark cycle with less dramatic changes in other measures
of activity than Lewis rats. During the light cycle, a different
pattern emerges with both Wistar and SD rats demonstrating an
increase in activity as evidenced by an increase in distance
moved and a decrease in the amount of time spent in the
shelter; Lewis rats moved more slowly during the light cycle.

Statistics
Parametric data are presented as the mean±standard deviation
(SD); nonparametric data are presented as the median (interquartile range). Group comparisons are performed with parametric or nonparametric tests as appropriate. Changes over
time are assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For
ease of data presentation, “heat maps” were created to display
increases or decreases in a given behavior and color coded to
show the strength of those associations. Correlations are by
Spearman’s rho. Significance was set at P<0.05.

Results
Stroke Severity
Infarct volumes at 24 h tended to be larger in SD rats (206 cm3
[122, 279]) than Wistar (176 cm3 [64, 260]) and Lewis
(149 cm3 [82, 297]) rats, but these differences were not
statistically significant (P=0.41). At 1 month after MCAO,
Wistar rats had not yet regained their pre-MCAO bodyweight
and Lewis rats had lower body temperatures than the other
strains (baseline body temperatures were similar among
strains). Performance on behavioral tests was similar among
all three strains (Table 1).

Prior to stroke, there were no significant differences in the
duration of immobility or the latency to become immobile
during the FST among the three strains (Table 3). Following
stroke, the duration of immobility was longer and the latency
to become immobile shorter among Lewis rats. There was also
an increase in the duration of immobility among Wistar rats,
but no change in the latency to immobility as compared to
baseline. Further, at 1 month after surgery, the duration of
immobility was greater in Lewis rats undergoing MCAO
(366 s [277, 471]) as compared to Lewis rats undergoing sham
surgery (263 s [222, 300]; P=0.03). For Wistar and SD rats,
neither the duration of immobility nor the latency to immobility differed between animals undergoing MCAO versus
sham surgery. Just prior to the FST, spontaneous locomotor
activity, as measured in the home cage, was similar in all
strains during the dark cycle. During the light cycle, Wistar
rats exhibited more spontaneous locomotion each hour
(150 cm [86, 334]) than either Lewis or SD rats (9 cm [0,
242] and 24 cm [2, 100], respectively, P=0.031). Performance
on the foot fault test and the rotarod was similar in all three
strains at this time point (Table 1).
Histology
Atrophy of the ischemic hemisphere was less pronounced in
Lewis rats at 30 days after MCAO (Table 4).

rats had decreased circulating IL-1α in comparison to Lewis
and Wistar rats while Lewis rats had increased IL-10 in
comparison to Wistar and SD rats. Table 6 shows the associations between systemic cytokine concentrations, spontaneous behavior in the home cage, performance on the FST, and
hemispheric atrophy (at Bregma −0.40 mm) 1 month after
MCAO. There was no association between the degree of
hemispheric atrophy and systemic cytokines at this time point.
There was no correlation between hemispheric atrophy and
spontaneous activity during the dark cycle, but increased
atrophy was associated with a decrease in the maximal velocity of movement during the light cycle. Increased IL-1α was
associated with increased shelter time during the dark/active
cycle and decreased shelter time during the light/inactive
cycle with a concomitant increase in the distance moved.
Further, IL-1α was associated with an increase in the duration
of immobility on the FST. IL-1ra was also associated with

increased movement (both the distance and maximal velocity
of movement) during the light/inactive cycle. Finally, IL-10
was associated with an increase in immobility during the FST.
Hemispheric atrophy was not associated with performance on
the FST.

Discussion
Despite similar outcomes on traditional behavioral tests
1 month after MCAO, there were significant differences in
stroke-induced changes in spontaneous locomotor activity and
performance on the FST among the different strains. Lewis
rats increased locomotor activity during the dark/active cycle,
but at the same time decreased the latency to and increased the
duration of immobility on the FST. This strain thus exhibited

“learned helplessness” after stroke, consistent with depressive
behavior, but showed no evidence of fatigue (in fact, there was
an increase in spontaneous locomotor activity and no change
in the median velocity of movement). Wistar and SD rats, on
the other hand, appeared to have a disruption in the normal
diurnal activity patterns with increased activity during the
light/inactive cycle after stroke while simultaneously
exhibiting a decrease in the velocity of movements during
the dark/active cycle. Given similar outcome on behavioral
tests at 1 month in all three strains, it seems unlikely that the
decrease in the velocity of movement was related to

neurological/motor dysfunction from the stroke. One possible
interpretation for the decrease in the median velocity of movement after stroke is that it represents fatigue. Based on the
results of the FST, SD rats did not display learned helplessness
(depression) after stroke while Wistar rats displayed an increase in the duration of immobility but no change in the
latency to immobility. In concert, these data suggest that
PSF and PSD differ: Lewis rats exhibit depressive behavior
but no change in locomotion while SD rats exhibit changes in
locomotion but not in depressive behavior; the behavior of
Wistar rats is intermediate between Lewis and SD rats. The

difference between Lewis and SD rats suggest that depression
and fatigue have different biological substrates and thus parallel the human condition in which PSD and PSF appear to be
different clinical entities [8, 9].
Our data show that the duration of and the latency to
immobility in the FST are similar at baseline among all three
strains. Others have also reported similar performance on the
FST among these strains [21, 22]. The propensity towards
learned helplessness in Lewis rats has also been described
[23]. Of note, the degree of hemispheric atrophy after stroke
did not correlate with performance on the FST. In our study,
systemic concentrations of both IL-1α and IL-10 correlated
with learned helplessness after stroke. The data supporting a
role for inflammation in depression are indirect, but generally
suggest that dysregulated inflammation, detected by an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and a decrease in antiinflammatory cytokines, correlates with depressive symptoms
[24]. Despite similar IL-1α concentrations in Lewis and
Wistar rats, Lewis rats were more likely to exhibit learned
helplessness. Of the cytokines assayed in this study, Lewis rats
were unique with regards to immunomodulatory cytokine IL10, for which they had the highest concentration after MCAO.
The immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10 was also positively
correlated with the duration of immobility on the FST. In a
clinical study of PSD, serum concentrations of IL-10 (as well
as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, and interferon
[IFN]-γ) were higher in patients with PSD than in those
without [25]. In another study of patients with cardiovascular
risk factors, IL-10 was strongly linked to a depressive mood

[26]. In animal studies, however, IL-10 knock out animals
exhibit an increase in depressive behavior and administration
of IL-10 decreases this behavior [27]. Based on existing data,
it is unclear whether IL-10 contributes to the pathophysiology
of depression, is a biomarker of depression, or merely a
confounder by virtue of increased expression in response to
ongoing inflammation is unknown.
Animal models of fatigue generally rely on the induction
on inflammation to induce “sickness behavior”. “Sickness
behavior” in animals is characterized by a decrease in locomotor activity, which is considered to be an equivalent of
fatigue [28, 29]. In comparison to other strains, Lewis rats
are more prone to inflammation and more susceptible to
immune mediated diseases [21, 15, 16]. At 1 month after
MCAO, systemic concentrations of IL-1α were similar in
Lewis and SD rats, but significantly higher than in SD rats.
Spontaneous home cage behavior was related to IL-1α as well
as its endogenous antagonist, IL-1ra. Increases in IL-1α were
associated with increased shelter time during the dark/inactive
cycle, a behavior indicative of stress in rodents [30]. IL-1α
was also associated with decreased shelter time and an increase in movement during the light/inactive cycle compared
to baseline, suggesting disruption in sleep. IL-1ra, the endogenous antagonist of IL-1α, was also associated with increased
movement and increased velocity of movement during the
light/inactive cycle. What can be gleaned from these data is
that IL-1α and IL-1ra do not appear to be closely linked to
behaviors associated with fatigue. These cytokines do appear,
however, to be associated with an increase in light/inactive
cycle activity and disruption of normal diurnal rhythms.
Whether IL-1ra drives this change in light cycle activity or
its elevation is merely a response to the increase in IL-1α is
unknown. In clinical studies, low levels of IL-1ra early after
stroke onset appear to predict the development of fatigue, but
little is known about the correlation between cytokine concentrations at the time of PSF [31].
The major limitation of this study is the relatively small
number of animals in each group. For spontaneous behavior,
however, each activity measure represents the median value
for 5 days, reducing the likelihood or spurious results. The
association between systemic cytokines and behavior, however, can only be viewed as exploratory and hypothesis building. Next steps would be to repeat these studies in larger
numbers of animals and to test the effects of IL-1, IL-1ra,
and IL-10 administration (and inhibition) on performance in

IL-1raI Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, IL interleukin, NC not calculable
a

Bregma −0.40 mm was used

the FST and on spontaneous locomotion. At least one study
has shown that depressive behavior in mice after MCAO is
inhibited by administration of IL-1ra [32]. Whether one cytokine alone is responsible for driving these behaviors or whether it is the global inflammatory state as represented by an array
of cytokines/biomarkers is unknown. Similarly, it is unknown
whether all rat strains would respond to cytokine
administration/inhibition in the same way.
This study demonstrates that interstrain differences can be
advantageous in the study of poststroke behaviors. The fact
that the immune response can differ robustly among strains
allows for the correlation between behavior and inflammatory
biomarkers. Importantly, this study adds to the evidence that
the biological constructs of PSF and PSD are different. Further
evaluation of the PSD-prone Lewis rats and the PSF-prone
Wistar and SD rats may improve our understanding of the

pathophysiology of these symptoms and suggest potential
therapeutic interventions.
