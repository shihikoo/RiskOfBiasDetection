Background: Excessive inflammation and apoptosis contribute to the pathogenesis of
ischemic brain damage. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) is considered to be a key
protein complex involved in this cascade of events. The aim of the present study
was to clarify the protection mechanism of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
Methods: Lewis rats (N 5 90) were randomly assigned to three groups: (1) the
sham-operated group; (2) the saline group, in which the animals underwent rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO, for 2 hours) and were treated with
saline through the tail vein; and (3) the MSCs group, in which the animals underwent tMCAO (for 2 hours) and were infused with cultured human MSCs
(4 3 106/0.4 ml PBS) through the tail vein. At days 1 and 3 post-MSCs infusion,
real-time PCR, and Western blot, immunohistochemical analyses were applied for
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and P-IKKb, p53, and Bcell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression levels. Results: TNF-a, IL-1b messenger RNA
(mRNA) and P-IkB-a, P-IKKb, p53 protein expression levels were significantly
increased in the saline group compared with the sham group. However, IkB-a and
Bcl-2 protein expression levels were markedly decreased in the saline group. After
injection of BrdU1 MSCs, the expression levels of TNF-a, IL-1b mRNA and P-IkB-a,
P-IKKb, p53 protein were significantly decreased. Contrary to these findings, IkB-a,
Bcl-2 protein expression levels were markedly increased. In addition, we found that
infarct area was significantly reduced in MSCs group. Conclusions: These results
suggest that MSCs’ neuroprotection is attributable to its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effect through inhibition of NF-kB. Key Words: Human mesenchymal
stem cells—nuclear factor-kappa B—inflammation—apoptosis—rat cerebral
ischemia and reperfusion.

Introduction
Cerebral ischemia and subsequent reperfusion is a pathologic condition characterized by an initial restriction of
blood supply to brain tissue. This is then followed by the
restoration of blood flow and concomitant tissue reoxygenation. Ischemic events result in an immediate loss of oxygen and glucose to the cerebral tissue causing localized
damage. However, perhaps more surprisingly, the restoration of tissue blood flow and reoxygenation is frequently
associated with an exacerbation of brain tissue injury.1

EFFECTS OF MSC TRANSPLANTATION IN RAT BRAIN

2599

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that inflammation contributes to stroke progression during the ischemia
stage. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) is perhaps the most
important contributor to this process.2 The transcription
factor NF-kB is a nuclear factor that binds to the enhancer
element of the immunoglobulin kappa light chain of activated B cells.3 Soon afterward it became clear that proteins,
which harbor this specific DNA binding activity, are expressed in nearly all cell types and regulate many target
genes with a whole variety of functions.4 In total, 5 members of this transcription factor family have been identified,
designated as p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, NF-kB1, and NFkB2. In resting cells, such as macrophage/microglia, NFkB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by binding to inhibitory
IkB proteins typified by IkB-a. Once activated upon by a
myriad of stimuli including oxidative stress, hypoxia,
and several inflammatory mediators, the IkB factors are
phosphorylated by cytokine-responsive IkB kinase (IKK).
Dissociation and degradation of IkB induces the translocation of NF-kB from the cytosol to the nucleus and facilitates
the transcription of several proinflammatory cytokines
including tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1b
(IL-1b), inducible nitric oxide synthase, which results in
additional neuronal damage. Presently, strong evidence
supports the notion that activation of NF-kB in neurons
contributes to ischemia-induced neuronal injury.5,6
Furthermore, NF-kB activation upregulates expression of
proapoptotic factors such as p537,8 and downregulates
the antiapoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2).9,10
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapies have
proven to be effective in experimental models of numerous
disorders.11-14 Treatment of ischemic brain injury by
transplantation of MSCs in neonatal animal models has
been effective in reducing lesion volume and improving
functional outcome. This previous study has indicated
that MSCs play therapeutic effects through replacing
damaged tissues, secretion of growth factors, and antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic properties.15 However,
the anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic mechanisms of
MSCs remain poorly delineated. Based on this evidence,
we hypothesized that MSCs could attenuate the inflammatory response induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
insult through the inhibition of NF-kB.
To test our hypothesis, we designed the experiment. We
used a rat model of cerebral I/R injury to further
investigate the neuroprotective effects of MSCs as well as
the underlying mechanisms by focusing on inflammatory
response and apoptotic signaling, as these pathways
closely involve NF-kB.

blot analysis. Protein levels of IkB-a (.13 6 .01/0.32 6 .03), a
direct indicator of NF-kB activation, were significantly
decreased after cerebral I/R injury compared with the
sham group (P , .05; Fig 1). In contrast, P-IkB-a
(.26 6 .03/0.09 6 .01) and P-IKKb (.23 6 .03/0.08 6 .01)
protein expression levels were markedly increased in the
saline group (P , .05; Fig 2, A,B), which indicates that
IkB-a enhanced phosphorylation by increasing P-IKKb. After MSC treatment, IkB-a (.23 6 .03/0.13 6 .01) protein
expression was upregulated compared with the saline
group (P , .05; Fig 1). Simultaneously, P-IkB-a (.12 6 .02/
0.26 6 .03) and P-IKKb (.11 6 .01/0.23 6 .03) protein
expression levels were markedly downregulated in the
MSC group (P , .05; Fig 2, A,B). These results suggest
that the neuroprotective effects of MSCs may be associated
with inhibition of the NF-kB signaling pathway.

MSCs Suppressed I/R-Induced Expression of
Inflammatory Factors
To determine the effects of MSCs on the inflammatory
process in postischemic brain tissue, we measured several
proinflammatory cytokines by quantitative polymerase
chain reaction after cerebral I/R injury. TNF-a (8.2 6 .85/
1.0 6 .15) and IL-1b (3.2 6 .36/1.0 6 .13) transcripts, which
are proinflammatory NF-kB target genes, were significantly increased after cerebral I/R injury compared with
the sham group (P , .05; Fig 3, A,B). After intravenous
administration of MSCs, TNF-a (4.6 6 .50/8.2 6 .85) and
IL-1b (1.3 6 .20/3.2 6 .36) messenger RNA (mRNA)
expression levels were markedly decreased. This suggested that TNF-a and IL-1b mRNA were downregulated

in vivo after MSC treatment. These findings indicated that
MSCs could suppress inflammatory factors.

MSCs Inhibit I/R-Induced Apoptosis in Cerebral
Ischemia
Apoptosis is one of the most important mechanisms in
the pathophysiology of cerebral infarction. The tumor suppressor p53 is one of the NF-kB target genes. We determined p53 and Bcl-2 expression levels by Western blot
analysis 24 hours after MSC infusion. The p53
(1.75 6 .20/0.13 6 .02) protein level was markedly
increased in rats with cerebral I/R injury compared with
the sham group (P , .05; Fig 4, A). In contrast, Bcl-2
(.18 6 .02/0.65 6 .07) protein levels were markedly
decreased (P , .05; Fig 4, B). After MSC treatment, p53
(.23 6 .03/1.75 6 .20) protein levels were significantly
downregulated in rats with cerebral I/R injury (P , .05;
Fig 4, A). Meanwhile, the expression level of Bcl-2
(.60 6 .07/0.18 6 .02) was significantly upregulated in
the MSCs group (P , .05; Fig 4, B). These data indicated
that p53 levels decreased and Bcl-2 levels increased after
MSCs treatment.

BrdU1 MSCs Persist in the Infarcted Area
We found that BrdU1 labeled MSCs appeared dark
brown in the brain tissue of rats’ ischemic cortex after

immunohistochemical staining. BrdU1 MSC aggregates
were found to persist in brain tissue that was considered
to have undergone infarction (Fig 5).

MSCs Reduce Infarction Volume Following Focal Brain
Ischemia
Seventy-two hours after transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (tMCAO), the rat brains were evaluated for
infarction volume using 2,3,5-triphenyl four azole nitrogen
chloride (TTC) staining, and the volume of infarction was
determined using an image analysis system (ImagingPro-Plus [Olympus, Tokyo, Japan]). Representative samples of TTC-stained brain sections are shown in Figure 6,
A, with corresponding infarction volumes shown in
Figure 6, B. We observed a significant increase in infarction
volume in the saline group compared with the sham group
(38.1 6 4.2% vs. .7 6 .5%, respectively; P ,.05). In contrast,
the MSC group showed a marked reduction in infarction
volume compared with the saline groups (18.5 6 2.7%;
P , .05 vs. saline).

Discussion
Ischemic stroke is the most common form of stroke and is
typically caused by the occlusion of major cerebral arteries.
Cerebral ischemic insults induce neurochemical changes,
known as an ‘‘ischemic cascade,’’ which includes the

over-release of glutamate, accumulation of intracellular
calcium, formation of free radicals, release of inflammatory
cytokines, and cessation of energy metabolism.16 Inflammatory cytokines play an important role in intracellular
signaling pathways involved in tissue damage during I/R
injury.17 Recently, MSCs have generated great interest as a
potent therapeutic modality for brain injury because of
their multipotency, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and angiogenic properties.18-20 Simultaneously, MSCs
have been investigated in the management of cerebral
ischemic condition, because of their immunomodulatory,
neuroprotective, and neurodifferentiation properties.21,22
Previous studies have demonstrated that human
umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs provide protection
against posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus and brain damage after severe intraventricular hemorrhage might be
primarily mediated by or associated with their antiinflammatory effects rather than their regenerative capabilities.11-13 Although the anti-inflammatory actions of
MSCs have been reported in various disorders, including
bronchopulmonary dysplasia,11,12 acute respiratory
distress syndrome,14 and neonatal stroke,13 the molecular
mechanism remains unclear. The available data indicate
that activation of NF-kB contributes to ischemiainduced neuronal injury.23 Here, we investigated the

mechanisms of action of MSCs by focusing on their effects
on NF-kB–mediated inflammation and apoptosis.
NF-kB exists in an inactive form by associating with
an inhibitory protein of the IkB family. We found that
cerebral I/R injury resulted in P-IKKb activation and
IkB-a degradation. MSCs significantly reduced the protein levels of P-IKKa and inhibited the I/R-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IkB-a. The mechanism
underlying the attenuation of I/R-induced activation of
NF-kB by MSCs, may include inhibition of NF-kB activation due to downregulation of intelectin expression by
MSCs.24 This particular study revealed that Shuanghuang-lian injection downregulates NF-kB expression
via inhibition of intelectin. According to the Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China, Shuang-huanglian injection, a typical Chinese herbal compound powder
for injection that is primarily made from extracts of Flos
Lonicerae, Radix Scutellariae, and Fructus Forsythiae Suspensae (Harbin Pharmaceutical, Co, Ltd, Harbin, China).
Chlorogenic acid is one of the effective components of this
injection. The molecular formula is C16H18O9, the molecular weight is 354.30 KD.
It has been widely used for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases in Chinese hospitals, such as upper
respiratory tract infections, rheumatoid arthritis, based

on its potent anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects.
Therefore, MSCs could attenuate the activation of NFkB by regulation of intelectin expression.
Inflammation has been increasingly recognized as a key
contributor to the negative pathophysiology of stroke.
Several proinflammatory NF-kB target genes, including
TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase,
could mediate the deleterious effects on neurons under
ischemic conditions.25 In this study, cultured bone marrow
MSCs was infused through tail veins. At day 3 after MSCs
infusion, rats were killed and their brain tissues were evaluated by real-time PCR and Western blot. We measured
TNF-a and IL-1b levels to evaluate their roles in tMCAOinduced cerebral injury. We found an elevation in serum
TNF-a and IL-1b in the saline group. The levels were maintained throughout the investigation in the saline group. In
contrast, TNF-a and IL-1b expression levels were significantly downregulated in the MSCs group. This observation
is consistent with the results of previous studies. These
data suggested that these 2 proinflammatory cytokines
might be involved in reperfusion injury after transient
brain ischemia, indicating that MSCs could play a neuroprotective role via inhibition of inflammatory cytokines
expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that
MSCs can also be neuroprotective because the cells have

important anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties.15,26-28 Based on the evidence, we speculate that
MSCs can attenuate the inflammatory response induced
by ischemia–reperfusion insult through inhibition of
NF-kB.
Wang et al29 demonstrated that the regulation of NF-kB
pathway by MSC transplantation might play a key role in
the modulation of proinflammatory genes expression.
Data from our study corroborates, in part, aspects of the
Wang et al29 study. The research described very similar
studies that have been presented in our study. One key
difference in both the works is the cells that were used
in each study. Wang et al29 used what appears to be an
immortalized human MSC cell line (B10) whereas the current authors used primary human MSCs. The B10 cell line
was initially established by Nagai et al30 and described
the multipotent attributes of this cell line. However, this
cell was created via the viral transduction of the v-myc
oncogene so that it could become immortalized. This
does not have any clinical value as one does not want
the overexpression of an oncogene in the body. The
constitutive expression of an oncogene may have had
deleterious/promotive effects on the system that was
studied. The MSC B10 cell line has not been shown
whether it is tumorigenic over long periods in vivo either.
We could make the point that their study is the first to
use primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in
an injury model of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.
Human bone marrow MSCs are derived from adult
bone marrow and do not contain bacteria, fungi, and viruses (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus,
hepatitis C virus) and mycoplasma. So, this has direct
clinical applications for future stroke injury studies.
The use of primary MSCs is novel and may be more
realistic in terms of the cell type used and future clinical
settings.
A wealth of evidence suggests that apoptosis is an
important pathophysiologic mode of cell death in ischemic
brain injury.31,32 Induction of p53 is associated with strokeinduced apoptotic neuronal cell death, and applications of
p53 inhibitors can significantly attenuate ischemia-induced
brain injury.33,34 In this study, significant augmentation
in p53 levels was observed 24 hours after I/R insult
in the saline group. In contrast, treatment with MSCs
dramatically suppressed the increase of p53 protein
levels in the MSCs group. Unlike p53, we found that the
antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 was markedly increased in the
MSC group compared with the saline group. In agreement
with our research, administration of MSCs 3-24 hours after
a stroke in adult animals reduced the number of apoptotic
cells by approximately 50% in the ischemic boundary zone,
which was accompanied by an increased expression and
survival of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2.15 These results
indicate that transplantation of MSCs in the very early
phase of ischemic brain injury is neuroprotective and
thereby improves functional outcome.

2603

Prior studies have suggested that NF-kB–dependent p53
induction is implicated in excitotoxin-induced apoptotic
death of striatal neurons.8,35 In agreement with the
previously mentioned reports, Aleyasin et al7 also demonstrated that p53 was regulated by NF-kB in neurons
exposed to DNA damage. Based on the existing evidence,
we speculate that MSCs may attenuate the apoptotic
pathway of neuron through the inhibition of NF-kB–
dependent p53 induction.
With regards to the Bcl-2 protein, several reports have
shown that the reactive oxygen species–activated transcription factor NF-kB negatively regulated the transcription of the Bcl-2.9,10,36 We also found that Bcl-2 was
downregulated after the ischemia–reperfusion insult,
and MSC administration attenuated the decline in Bcl-2.
We observed the rat infarct volume of 3 groups and
found that the infarct volume of the saline group significantly increased compared with that of the sham group.
In contrast, the infarct volume was markedly decreased
in the MSCs group compared with the saline group. These
results indicated that MSCs play neuroprotective roles via
decreasing the apoptosis of neurons in rats.
In summary, our research has demonstrated that the
administration of MSCs significantly protected neurons
against cerebral I/R insult in a rat model. The neuroprotective effects of MSCs appear to be associated with the
inhibition of NF-kB activation and consequent suppression of inflammatory and apoptotic responses.

Experimental Procedure
Animals
Sixty healthy (female, N 5 90), 3-month-old Lewis rats
were provided by the Laboratory Animal Center of the
Fourth Military Medical University, China (license no.
08-33). The rats were housed at 22 6 2 C, with 50 6 5%
humidity, and were allowed free access to water and
chow. All experimental protocols were conducted in accordance with the Guidance Suggestions for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals, formulated by the Ministry of Science
and Technology of China.37

Methods
The Cultivation of hMSCs
hMSCs (ATCC, Gaithersburg, MD) were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine
serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY). The cells were plated
at a density of 1 3 106 cells/cm2 and cultured at 37 C in
a 5% CO2 incubator in air. When the cell density reached
80%-90%, cells were passaged. The media was changed
every 3-4 days. hMSCs from ATCC were passaged every
3-4 days. Cells were incubated for 8-12 days. MSCs of passage 2 and passage 3 were used in the experiments. BrdU

Establishment of a Rat Model of Cerebral I/R Injury
The tMCAO procedure was performed as described
by Longa et al and revised by Lourbopoulos et al.38,39
Briefly, the left common carotid artery and external
carotid artery (ECA) were exposed, and the left
internal carotid artery (ICA) was dissected to the level
of the pterygopalatine artery. The distal part of the left
ECA was permanently ligated, and a small incision
was made on the proximal ECA. Through the incision,
a 25-mm nylon thread (4-0) with a rounded tip and a
distal cylinder of silicon rubber (diameter, 300-340 mm)
was inserted. The nylon thread was gently advanced
through the ICA until a light resistance was encountered. After 2 hours, the nylon thread was removed
from the ICA, and the restoration of blood flow was
confirmed by laser Doppler flowmetry.
Animal Experimental Groups
Lewis rats (N 5 90, female, 3 months old, 200-250 g)
were randomly assigned to 3 groups: (1) the shamoperated group (n 5 30), in which the animals were
anesthetized, and their left common and external carotid
arteries were exposed without performing arterial ligation or opening; (2) the saline group (n 5 30), in which
the animals underwent rat tMCAO (for 2 hours) and
were treated with saline through the tail vein; and (3)
the MSCs group (n 5 30), in which the animals were
infused with cultured hMSCs (4 3 106/0.4 mL PBS)
through the tail vein 24 hours after tMCAO. At days 1
post-MSCs infusion, a third of each group of rats was
killed to harvest brain tissue for western blot (P53 and
Bcl-2). The remaining two thirds were applied for PCR
(TNF-a, IL-1b),western blot (IkB-a, P-IkB-a, and PIKKb),TTC staining, and immunohistochemistry 3 days
after MSCs infusion.
Tissue Specimens
After administration of abdominal anesthesia by 4%
chloral hydrate (1 mL/100 g), the rat brains were harvested. Brain tissues were incubated in 4% formalin for
24 hours for immunohistochemistry. Rat brains were isolated, snap frozen, and stored at 280 C until they were
used for Western blot and PCR analysis. Brain tissues
for TTC staining were snap frozen at 220 C for 10-20
minutes.

synthesis was performed using the PrimeScript RT reagent
kit (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). SYBR Green real-time PCR was
performed for rat TNF-a and IL-1b using the Perfect Real
Time Kit (Takara). The following pairs of primers were
used for PCR amplification: TNF-a forward primer, 50 CCTGTAGCCCACGTCGTAGCAAA-30 ; TNF-a reverse
primer, 50 -AGCGCTGAGTTGGTCCCCCT-30 ; IL-1b forward primer, 50 -AGCTGGAGAGTGTGGATCCCAAGC-30 ;
and IL-1b reverse primer, 50 -AGCGACCTGTCTTGGCCG
AGG-30 . Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Premix
Ex Taq polymerase (Takara) and Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett
Research, Sydney, Australia). The 2-step PCR amplification
conditions were as follows: (step 1) predenaturing, (95 C
for 10 seconds, 20 C/second, 1 cycle) and (step 2) PCR
reaction (95 C for 5 seconds, 20 C/second; 60 C for 20 seconds, 20 C/second; 40 cycles). The cycle threshold (Ct) of
each rat gene transcript was normalized to the Ct of rat bactin. Fold differences were determined by the 22DDCt
method.40
Western Blot Analysis for p53, Bcl-2, IkB-a, P-IkB-a,
and P-IKKb Protein Expression
Rat brain tissue was harvested for IkB-a, P-IkB-a, and
P-IKKb protein 3 days and for p53 and Bcl-2 protein
1 day after the rat model was built. Brain tissue was
then washed twice with cold PBS, and lysed in Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Pierce Biotechnology Inc, Rockford, IL).
Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method.41 After 15 minutes on ice, lysates were
centrifuged at 15,0003 g for 15 minutes to remove insoluble material. A total of 50 mg of the protein samples
were used for the 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis transfers. Proteins
were subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was then incubated with 5% skim milk in
Tris-buffered saline with .1% Tween 20 for 1 hour at
room temperature. Subsequently, the membranes were
incubated with the primary antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti–IkB-a [1:1000; Sigma, Saint Louis, MO] or
mouse monoclonal anti–p-IkB-a [1:1000; Sigma] or rabbit
polyclonal anti-P-IKKb [Ser181, 1:1000; Santa Cruz, CA]
or mouse monoclonal anti-p53 [1:1000; CST, Boston,
MA] or rabbit polyclonal anti-Bcl-2 [1:1000; Santa Cruz]
and anti-b-actin [1:5000; Sigma]) overnight at 4 C.
After washing with Tris-buffered saline with .1% Tween
20, membranes were then incubated with fluorescent
secondary antibodies (Li-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE),
and the signal was read with an Odyssey Western Blot
Analysis system (Li-COR Biosciences). Densitometry
was performed using Image J (National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD) and was normalized to a loading control rat b-actin (data were shown as relative
absorbance).

Immunohistochemistry for BrdU Cells in Brain
Tissues
The rat brains were harvested 3 days after MSCs were
transplantated. Rat brain tissues were fixed for 5 minutes
by instillation of 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS (Sigma) overnight and cut to 2-mm thick coronal sections. Sections,
including the injection site, were embedded in paraffin
and further sliced at a thickness of 5 mm. In accordance
with
the
streptavidin–biotin–peroxidase
complex
method,42 5-mm thick sections were used for immunohistochemistry with an antimouse monoclonal antibody against
BrdU (1:200; Boster; Wuhan, Hubei, China; incubating for
12 hours at 4 C). Peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse
IgG (1:1 000; Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) was used as the secondary antibody (incubating for 30 minutes at 37 C). Antibodies were detected
using the DAB kit (Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology,) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally,
the distribution of BrdU1 cells was observed using a light
microscope (BH-2; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
TTC Staining and Evaluation of Infarction Volume
TTC staining for infarction volume was performed
according to the following procedures. Briefly, at 72 hours
post-MCAO, rats (sham group, n 5 10; saline group,
n 5 10; MSC group, n 5 10) were deeply anesthetized
with ketamine and then decapitated. The brains were
then rapidly removed and sliced into 2-mm thick coronal
sections in an adult rat brain matrix. The slices were
stained in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyl four azole nitrogen chloride
(TTC) staining (TTC; Sigma) for 30 minutes at 37 C in the
dark. The infarcted area and the hemispheric area of
each section were traced and measured using an image
analysis system (Imaging-Pro-Plus [Olympus]). The
possible interference of brain edema to infarct volume
was corrected by standard methods (contralateral hemisphere volume–volume of nonischemic ipsilateral hemisphere), with infarcted volume expressed as a percentage
of the contralateral hemisphere.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using the SPSS 15.0 software (SPSS,
Chicago, IL). Experimental data are presented as
mean 6 standard error of mean. Differences between groups
are assessed by one-way analysis of variance followed by
Student Newman Keuls-q test. P , .05 was considered to
be significant.
