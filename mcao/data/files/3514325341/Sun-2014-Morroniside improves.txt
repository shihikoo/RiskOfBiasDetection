Abstract
Treating the vascular elements within the neurovascular unit is essential for protecting and repairing the brain after stroke.
Acute injury on endothelial systems results in the disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB), while post-ischemic angiogenesis
plays an important role in delayed functional recovery. Here, we considered alterations in microvessel integrity to be targets
for brain recovery, and tested the natural compound morroniside as a therapeutic approach to restore the vascular
elements of injured tissue in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) model, and morroniside was then administered intragastrically once a day at doses of 30, 90, and
270 mg/kg. BBB integrity and associated factors were analyzed to identify cerebrovascular permeability 3 days after MCAO.
The recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), the expression of angiogenic factors and the new vessel formation in
the peri-infarct cortex of rats were examined 7 days after MCAO to identify the angiogenesis. We demonstrated that at 3
days post-ischemia, morroniside preserved neurovascular unit function by ameliorating BBB injury. By 7 days post-ischemia,
morroniside amplified angiogenesis, in part by enhancing endothelial progenitor cell proliferation and expression of
angiogenic factors. Morever, the increase in the amount of vWF+ vessels induced by ischemia could be extended to 28 days
after administration of morroniside, indicating the crucial role of morroniside in angiogenesis during the chronic phase.
Taken together, our findings suggested that morroniside might offer a novel therapeutic approach for promoting
microvascular integrity recovery and provide a thoroughly new direction for stroke therapy.

transmigration of inflammatory cells as well as toxic molecules into
the brain parenchyma, which results in cerebral edema and
hemorrhage [5]. During the delayed phase, a powerful array of
endogenous mechanisms is recruited for neurovascular functional
plasticity and recovery [6]. Angiogenesis is an important process in
forming the new brain microvessels after cerebral ischemia, which
can improve tissue microperfusion within the ischemic boundary
region [7]. Even, a greater microvessel density in the ischemic
border correlated with longer survival in stroke patients [8]. The
angiogenic vessels may persist for more than 21 days following
cerebral ischemia [9]. The growth of new blood vessels provides
important source of neurotrophic support to newly generated
neurons [10] and also serves as routes for neuroblasts to move into
the recovering peri-infarct regions [11,12]. Taken together, for
vascular elements within the neurovascular unit, it is believed that
the alterations in microvessel integrity might be targets for BBB
function recovery, including cerebrovascular permeability during

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is the most common form of stroke and is
caused by the abrupt interruption of blood flow to the brain [1,2].
Beyond thrombolysis for small subsets of cerebral ischemia
patients, there are no therapies for stroke. The difficulty in drug
development for stroke is perhaps best represented by the history
of high-profile failures of a large number of neuroprotection
clinical trials. However, the emerging concept of the ‘‘neurovascular unit’’ suggests that focusing on saving neurons alone is not
sufficient. The relevance of dynamic interactions between cerebral
endothelial cells, astrocytes, pericytes and neurons is emphasized
for brain function and dysfunction after stroke.
During the early acute phase after stroke onset, besides basic cell
death mechanisms, one of the most important facets of neurovascular damage is manifested as disruptions of blood–brain barrier
(BBB) function [3,4]. BBB breakdown is represented by the
disruption of endothelial astrocyte-matrix interactions and leads to

the early phase and the angiogenesis process during the late phase
[13].
Morroniside is one of the most abundant iridoid glycosides
extracted from Cornus officinalis. Our previous studies have
demonstrated that besides the anti-oxidative and anti-apoptosis
effects in vitro [14,15], morroniside could reduce the infarct
volume and promotes neurological functional recovery 3 days after
focal ischemic stroke [16]. In the present study, we tested whether
the natural compound morroniside could promote microvessel
integrity repair and restore homeostasis in the neurovascular unit,
thus improving recovery after stroke. This study may provide a
potentially new strategy for stroke treatment.

Animals and the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
model
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 260–280 g were
purchased from Beijing Vitalriver Experimental Animal Co.
(Beijing, China) and were housed under a 12/12 h dark/light
cycle and specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. Before MCAO
model was performed, the rats were fasted without water
deprivation for 12 h. Focal ischemia was induced in enfluraneanesthetized rats for 30 minutes using the intraluminal vascular
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, as described previously
[16,17]. Blood pressure, blood gases, and blood glucose concentration were maintained in the normal range, and rectal
temperature was maintained in the range of 36.5 to 37.5uC
throughout the experiments. Sham operations were performed
using the same anesthesia and surgical procedures but without
insertion of the intraluminal filament.
The rats were randomly divided into five groups: a shamoperated group, a vehicle-treated ischemic model group, and
morroniside-treated ischemic groups at dose of 30 mg/kg/day,
90 mg/kg/day, or 270 mg/kg/day. Morroniside was dissolved in
normal saline and administered intragastrically once a day starting
at 3 h after MCAO. The vehicle control groups of the ischemic
and sham-operated rats received an equal volume of normal
saline. Animal protocols for these studies were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Xuanwu Hospital in Capital
Medical University.

Methods and Materials
Ethics statement
Animal protocols for this study were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Xuanwu Hospital in Capital Medical
University. The animals are fed and housed under a 12/12 h
dark/light cycle and specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions to
ensured physical and psychological well-being. During the practice
of research, we ensure the anaesthesia, surgery and post-operative
care of the animals. Before MCAO model performed, the rats
abstained from food overnight but were allowed free access to
water. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with 3.5%
enfluane in a mixture of 70% nitrous oxide and a balance of
oxygen (Bickford veterinary anesthesia equipment model
no. 61010, AM Bickford Inc., Wales Center, NY, USA). The rats
were orally intubated, immobilized with intra-arterial pancuronium bromide (0.6 mg/kg) and mechanically ventilated (Rodent
Ventilator Model 683, Harvard Apparatus Inc., Holliston, MA,
USA). The right femoral artery was catheterized with a PE-50
tube for continuous blood pressure monitoring and periodic blood
sampling for arterial gas levels, pH (248 pH/blood gas analyzer;
Chiron Diagnostics Ltd, Halstead, UK) and plasma glucose
(ACCU-CHEK Active GN 03173351, Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) 15 minutes before and after the onset of MCA
occlusion and 15 minutes before and after reperfusion. The mean
arterial blood pressure was measured through an indwelling
femoral arterial catheter connected to a pre-calibrated Statham
pressure transducer and was recorded continuously. Serial
measurements of arterial blood gas levels, pH and plasma glucose
were made. Filament MCA occlusion was induced by an
intraluminal filament model. Throughout the surgical procedure,
the rectal temperature was maintained at 37.5uC with a circulating
heating pad (Harvard Apparatus Ltd, Edenbridge, UK), and the
left temporal muscle temperature was maintained at 37.5uC with a
heating lamp. Next, a piece of nylon monofilament was inserted
into the left internal carotid artery via an arteriotomy and lodged
in the narrow proximal anterior cerebral artery, which blocked the
MCA at its origin. After 30 min of ischemia, reperfusion was
established by withdrawal of the filament. The rat’s body
temperature was measured frequently through the rectum until
it returned to normal levels. Animals from each group were placed
on a heating pad under a heating lamp throughout the surgical
procedure under anesthesia. When the cerebral and rectal
temperature both returned to normal levels, the animals were
allowed to regain consciousness and were placed under warm
conditions for an additional 3 hours.

Evans Blue (EB) staining
To analyze the cerebrovascular permeability after MCAO, the
rats were injected with 1 ml of 2% EB (Ourchem, Beijing, China)
71 h after MCAO. After 1 h, the animals were perfused with PBS.
The brains were removed and separated into hemispheres
ipsilateral and contralateral to the MCAO. Each hemisphere
was then homogenized in 2.5 ml of PBS and then in 2.5 ml of
60% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Next, the supernatants were collected after centrifuged for 30 min
at 10006g and detected at 610 nm. Briefly, the EB levels in each
hemisphere were determined according to a standard curve and
determined from the formula: (EB concentration65 ml)/mg brain
wet weight. The background EB levels in the non-ischemic
hemisphere were subtracted from the ischemic ipsilateral hemisphere.

Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry
analysis
Immunofluorescence staining was used to visualize von Willebrand factor (vWF)-positive vessels. Double-immunofluorescence
was used for bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) with laminin, and was
also used for the localization of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), MMP-2, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), and Tie-2. BrdU (50 mg/kg;
Sigma-Aldrich) was injected intraperitoneally twice daily for 4
consecutive days after MCAO. Next, the rats were perfused with
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and the brains were extracted and
post-fixed overnight. Ice-cold sections (40 mm) were prepared
using standard protocols. For BrdU staining, the sections were
pretreated with 50% formamide/280 mM NaCl/30 mM sodium
citrate at 65uC for 2 h, incubated in 2 M HCl at 37uC for 30 min,
and rinsed in boric acid (0.1 M, pH 8.5) at room temperature for
10 min. After incubation with a blocking solution, all sections were

collect supernatants as the total protein. The proteins were then
electrophoresed through a 10–15% sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and electrically transferred onto
a nitrocellulose membrane. This membrane was detected using
primary antibodies, including anti-Ang-1(Boster), anti-Tie-2
(Santa Cruz), anti-neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) (Abcam), anti-fibroblast
growth factor-2 (FGF-2) (Santa Cruz), and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Santa Cruz). The amount of protein
was normalized with b-actin values in the same lane.
For the IL-1b content assay, an ELISA kit (R&D, Minneapolis,
US) was applied. The protein supernatants were collected as
described above and detected with IL-1b according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

incubated with primary antibodies for 48 h at 4uC. Primary
antibodies included anti-BrdU (Abcam, Cambrige, UK), antilaminin (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-vWF (Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA), anti-MMP-9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), antiMMP-2 (Santa Cruz), anti-Ang-1 (Santa Cruz), anti-Tie-2 (Santa
Cruz), anti-bIII-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-GFAP (Santa
Cruz) antibodies. After incubation with CY2- or CY3-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) for 0.5 h,
mounting medium with 49-6-diamidino-2-phenylinidole (DAPI)
(Zhong Shan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) was
used to label cell nuclei. The fluorescence signals were visualized
using a microscope system (Nikon eclipse 80i, Japan) and a
confocal laser scanning microscope system (MRC1024, Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA).
For immunohistochemistry, the ice-cold brain sections were
stained with primary antibodies, including anti-MMP-2 (Boster,
Wuhan, Hubei, China), anti-MMP-9 (Santa Cruz), anti-CD34
(Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan), anti-Ang-1 (Boster), anti-Tie-2 (Santa
Cruz) antibodies. The secondary antibodies were biotinylated
horse anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz). The
sections were stained using the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex
method with 3,39-diaminobenzidine as a chromogen, followed by
being dehydrated in a graded alcohol series, cleared in xylene, and
coverslipped with neutral balsam. A light microscope equipped
with a computerized image analysis system (Olympus BX51,
Japan) was used to examine the stained sections.
All image analyses were conducted by observers who were
blinded to the treatment conditions. Every 10th section between
Bregma levels +1.60 and 20.2 mm were selected (total = 3
sections per brain). MMP-9+ cells, MMP-2+ cells and CD34+
vessels in the peri-infarct cortex were counted using a 40X
objective (400 mm6300 mm) on a light microscope (Olympus
BX51). Three areas of interest (AOIs) were selected around the
margin of infarct area as described in Figure 1B, to obtain an
average of the number of cells in peri-infarct cortex for each
section. An average for the three slices per hemisphere was then
taken. The digitalized images were contrast-enhanced to clearly
differentiate positive staining from the background, and a
thresholding procedure was established by using Image Pro Plus
5.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda, MD, USA) to
determine the number of immunoreactive cells within each fixed
field of view as previously described [18]. The counting of BrdU+/
laminin+ cells in the peri-infarct area was performed using a
confocal laser microscope of three sections per animal. AOIs were
scanned with a 640 objective lens in 260.6mm6260.6mm format in
the x-y direction. For semi-quantitative measurement of vWFlabeled vessels, only the vWF+ vessels with a clear lumen and those
vessels that formed ring-like or tubular structures were counted.
Three sections per brain from the same levels were selected as
described above. The number of vessels in each field
(AOI = 560 mm6560 mm; three squares per section as described
in the figure of vWF-immunostaining) was converted into the
number of vessels/mm2. No correction was done for blood vessels
that extended spatially over a sufficiently long distance.

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as the mean 6 SEM; n was the number
of animals in each experiment. The statistical significance of the
mean was calculated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Tukey’s multiple range post hoc test using Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences software (SPSS 13.0 Statistical Software; SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A value of p,0.05 was considered
significant.

Results
Morroniside regulates cerebrovascular permeability 3
days after cerebral ischemia
In order to provide the direct evidence whether morroniside
could protect the BBB function, Evans Blue dye was used to assess
BBB integrity at 72 h after MCAO. The results indicated that
Evans Blue extravasation was increased by approximately 1.1-fold
in ischemic rats compared to the sham-operated group, indicating
the disruption of BBB (Figure 1A). However, rats treated with
morroniside at the dose of 270 mg?kg21?day21 showed a 43%
reduction in Evans Blue extravasation after MCAO compared
with the vehicle-treated ischemic rats (Figure 1A). There was also
an decreasing tendency in 30 and 90 mg?kg21?day21 morronisidetreated animals compared with vehicle-treated ischemic rats, but
no significant difference. The results suggested that morroniside
could inhibit the disruption of cerebrovascular permeability during
the acute phase after ischemic stroke.

Morroniside alleviates MMPs activity and inflammatory
reaction in BBB injury 3 days after cerebral ischemia
It has been shown that the activation of MMPs plays a crucial
role in BBB injury after ischemic stroke [19,20]. Excessive MMP
activity can degrade the extracellular matrix and induce extensive
blood vessel damage. We examined whether MMPs are involved
in the mechanism of early BBB repair with treatment of
morroniside. MMP-2 was demonstrated to be expressed in
astrocytes around the margin of infarct areas by using doubleimmunofluorecence staining of MMP-2 with GFAP (Figure 1C).
This is in accordance with the immunohistochemistry staining of
MMP-2, which demonstrated astrocytic-like staining (Figure 1B).
In contrast, MMP-9+/vWF+ cells and MMP-9+/bIII-tubulin+ cells
were observed in the peri-infarct cortex, indicating MMP-9 was
mainly expressed in endothelial cells and neurons 3 days post
MCAO (Figure 1C). Immunohistochemistry staining of MMP-9 in
the ischemic cortex showed obvious neuronal immunoreactivity
(Figure 1B,D). As Figure 1D–F show, MMP-9 and MMP-2 levels
were both increased in the peri-infarct cortex of ischemia-treated
rats compared with sham-operated group at 72 h after ischemiareperfusion, which is consistent with previous reports [21] (MMP9+ cells?mm22, MCAO, 941.9661.5 versus sham, 452.19631.78,

Protein expression analysis
After the rats were euthanized under 10% chloral hydrate
(0.4 ml/kg) anesthesia, the whole cortex on the infarct side was
harvested for an assay of proteins involved in the angiogenesis
process and BBB permeability. The brain tissue was homogenized
in ice-cold buffer (tris-(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane 50 mM,
pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mM, 0.5% Triton X-100, edetic acid 1 mM,
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 1 M, lepeptin 10 mg/ml and aprotinin 60 mg/ml) and centrifuged at 14,0006g at 4uC for 30 min to

MMP-2 (Figure 1E) and MMP-9 (Figure 1F) in the peri-infarct

some evidence that morroniside may protect BBB function after
stroke via the suppression of MMPs.
BBB breakdown after stroke has also been associated with
inflammation [22,23]. In particular, excessive amounts of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1b) can
reduceapp:addword:reduce BBB function [24,25]. So the expression of IL-1b was assessed at 72 h after MCAO by ELISA. The
results indicated that levels of IL-1b were increased about 4.1-fold
in ischemia-treated rats compared with the sham-operated group
(Figure 1G; MCAO, 144.367.8 pg?ml21 versus sham,
28.0163.2 pg?ml21, p,0.001; n = 6). At the concentration of
morroniside 30 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 270 mg/kg respectively, it was
found that morroniside could significantly reduce IL-1b content to
control levels (Figure 1F; p,0.001, p,0.001, p,0.001, n = 6).
Taken together, these results suggested that morroniside might
protect the BBB partially by alleviating inflammatory reaction and
BBB leakage.

Morroniside promotes endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)
proliferation 7 days after cerebral ischemia
To study whether morroniside could promote angiogenesis in
the chronic microvessel integrity recovery, we next examined the
effects of morroniside on the recruitment of EPCs in infarct brain
areas 7 days after MCAO. Laminin is a basal membrane marker
of blood vessels. Newborn vascular endothelial cells labeled with
BrdU+/laminin+ were observed in the boundary of the ischemic
cortex by means of the immunofluorescence, and the number of
these double-positive cells was significantly increased about 71.1%
with morroniside treatment at dose of 270 mg?kg21?day21
(Figure 2A,B; BrdU+/laminin+ cells?mm22, morroniside,
41.3563.06 versus MCAO, 24.2461.47, p,0.01; n = 3). CD34
is an endothelial antigen that labels endothelial progenitor cells
and could be used as an indirect marker of neoangiogenesis
[26,27]. Treatment with morroniside significantly increased the
number of CD34+ vessels in the peri-infarct cortex (p,0.01)
compared with the vehicle-treated ischemic group (Figure 2C,D).
Taken together, these results suggested the beneficial effects of
morroniside on EPCs proliferation in the peri-infarct region of the
ischemic ipsilateral brain.

The results showed an increase in vWF+ vessels in the ipsilateral
peri-infarct cortex 7 days after MCAO and an absence of vWFimmunoreactive vessels in the infarct core (Figure 5A). The
number of vWF+ vessels was higher in the 270 mg?kg21?day21
morroniside-treated group than that in the vehicle-treated
ischemic rats (Figure 5B,C; morroniside 270 mg?kg21?day21,
254.8861.19 versus MCAO, 197.368.05, p,0.05; n = 3). Furthermore, vWF+ vessels were also detected 28 days after ischemia.
The results showed that treatment with morroniside at the
concentration of 90 and 270 mg?kg21?day21 could significantly
sustain the increase in the amount of vessels in the penumbra,
although there is no difference between the vehicle-treated
ischemic rats and the sham-operated rats 28 days after ischemia
(Figure 5B,D; vWF+ vessels?mm22, MCAO, 202.767.75 versus

the revascularization of ischemic brain by promoting the
elongation of new generated vessels.

Morroniside increases the expression of angiogenic
promoters 7 days after cerebral ischemia
Next, we examined the expression of angiogenic factors
involved in the angiogenesis process 7 days after cerebral ischemia.
In the remodeling peri-infarct cortex, new vessels showed
incomplete Ang-1-positive endothelial-like signals along with
vessel-associated Tie-2 expression (Figure 3A). Experiments of
double immunostaining revealed that Tie-2 and Ang-1 were
predominantly expressed in endothelial cells around the margin of
infarct areas where active vessel remodeling was noted (Figure 3B).
Treatment with morroniside increased the expression of Tie-2 and
Ang-1 with similar effects observed by immunoblotting (Figure 3C–
E; n = 3). We also examined the expression of NRP-1, FGF-2 and
VEGF in the cortex of ischemic ipsilateral brain, and found the
expression of NRP-1, FGF-2 and VEGF were increased by 7 daysischemia compared with the sham-operated group (Figure 4A–D;
p,0.05; p,0.05; p,0.01). Treatment with morroniside of
270 mg?kg21?day21 significantly increased the activation of
NRP-1 and FGF-2 (Figure 4B,C; p,0.01; p,0.01). Moreover,
treatment with morroniside at dose of 30, 90 and
270 mg?kg21?day21 upregulated the VEGF expression in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 4D). These results indicated that
morroniside might promote angiogenesis after ischemic injury by
activating the angiogenic signal and releasing the promoters.

Discussion
Recovery from cerebral ischemia is a complex and highly
dynamic process that includes both initial injury and response
signals as well as the activation of endogenous self-preservation
processes [28]. A key aspect of neurovascular unit protection after
stroke involves preservation of BBB function [4], especially the
microvascular integrity of neurovascular unit. In previous reports
[14–16], we identified morroniside, a primary active ingredient
extracted from the Chinese herb C. officinalis, as a potent acute

Morroniside increases the vWF+-vessels of ipsilateral periinfarct cortex 7 days and 28 days after cerebral ischemia
In order to obtain more evidence on promoting the recovery of
vascular element within neurovascular by morroniside-treatment,
immunofluorescence was applied to label the vessels with vWF.

ischemia. Morroniside inhibited the disruption of cerebrovascular
permeability, suggesting the protective effects on acute BBB injury.
Expression of MMPs has been shown to be significantly increased
during stroke in human and rat models of focal ischemia [31–33].
MMP-9 is activated within 24 h to months after ischemic episode,
while MMP-2 is increased by 2–5 days because its activation
requires the presence of TIMP-2 [21]. Consistent with these data,
we showed that MMPs were upregulated on 3 days post-injury.
This increase in the level of MMPs contributed to the disruption of
the BBB, leading to vasogenic cerebral edema in acute ischemia.
Besides, we showed that MMP-2 was expressed by astrocytic
endfeet 3 days after MCAO, and MMP-9 was localized within
endothelial cells and neurons, which is consistent with previous

neuroprotectant both in an oxidative stress-induced neurotoxic cell
model and a focal cerebral ischemia rat model. Here, we focused
on the role of morroniside in protecting and restoring the BBB
integrity to better assess its effects on ischemic stroke recovery.
Our findings suggested that morroniside could inhibit the acute
injury on microvascular integrity and could promote angiogenesis
for neurovascular recovery after stroke.
Ischemia–reperfusion in the brain triggers oxidative and
nitrative injury in the neurovascular unit [29]. High levels of
superoxide and peroxynitrate production observed in neurons,
astrocytes and the endothelium, are associated with vascular injury
and blood–brain barrier breakdown [30]. In the present study, the
leakage of Evans Blue indicated BBB breakdown 3 days postPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

morroniside for 7 days after ischemia-injury significantly promoted
angiogenesis process to restore microvascular functional integrity.
Angiogenesis is important for chronicapp:addword:chronic
stroke recovery, since angiogenic stimulation generates new
vessels, which could increase the collateral circulation, repair the
BBB functionality and provide the important scaffolds for NPC
migration toward the damaged brain region. Researches on
molecular mechanisms of post-ischemic angiogenesis have shown
that angiogenesis is a multistep process including several developmental milestones, and most important, endothelial cell activation
contributes to vascular homeostasis and repair mechanisms [38–
40]. Our results showed that newborn vascular endothelial cells
labeled with BrdU+/laminin+ were localized in the boundary of
the ischemic cortex. Moreover, treatment with morroniside for 7
days after the ischemia significantly increased the number of newly
formed vessels in the peri-infarct areas, as labeled with EPC and
matured endothelial cell marker. At 28 days post ischemia, the

studies [13,34]. It is also thought that focal ischemia of the brain is
a pro-inflammatory stimulus and that interactions of inflammatory
cytokines with components of the neurovasculature are in response
to BBB permeability [23]. Our studies supported this hypothesis
and identified IL-1b as a stimulus of endothelial permeability,
which has been previously postulated to facilitate edema formation
during the initial moments following the onset of focal ischemia
[35,36]. On the basis of these results, we conjectured that
morroniside regulated cerebrovascular permeability after stroke
via the downregulation of MMPs and IL-1b, hence inhibiting
edema formation during the initial phase. However, the effects of
morroniside on MMPs are different from those of MMP inhibitors
which are used to restore the early integrity of the BBB in rodent
ischemia models but are ineffective in the later opening at 48 h
[37]. Direct MMP inhibitors could block or slow down neurorepair from stroke, since MMPs are involved in both angiogenic
and neurogenic processes. However, successive administration of

Figure 6. Schematic diagram of morroniside on neurovascular homeostasis rehabilitation (NHR) hypothesis. This diagram presents a
new model proposed for restoration of microvessel integrity of neurovascular unit following ischemia. Cerebral ischemia induces not only initial
injury on the vascular compartments of the neurovascular unit, but also the activation of endogenous self-preservation processes during the delayed
phase. However, morroniside-treatment could regulate BBB permeability during the initial phase following the onset of focal ischemia and could
facilitate brain self-repair processes of angiogenesis, finally promoting blood-brain barrier remodeling in response to ischemia. It suggests a potential
strategy that targeting the vascular compartments in damaged brain by using exogenous drugs for neurovascular homeostasis rehabilitation.

number of vWF+ vessels in the penumbra of vehicle-treated
ischemic rats was not significantly different from that in shamoperated rats. However, administration of morroniside
(90 mg?kg21?and 270 mg?kg21) enhanced the amount of vWF+
vessels at 28 days after ischemia, suggesting that morroniside plays
a crucial role in angiogenesis during the chronic phase.
Angiogenesis is demonstrated to be regulated by angiogenic
growth factors, especially the VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR)
and the Ang-1/Tie-2 system [41]. We evaluated the expression of
angiogenic growth factors involved to confirm the beneficial effects
of morroniside on angiogenesis. As the most important and bestcharacterized angiopoietin, Ang-1 promotes endothelial cell
survival and blood vessel maturation via binding to its receptor
Tie-2, which is highly expressed in developing vasculature but is
down-regulated in the vasculature of the adult brain [42,43]. As
reported in previous studies, significant increases in both protein
levels and mRNA levels of Ang-1 and Tie-2 in the ischemic
cerebral cortex was induced by transient ischemia, and this
regulation may have an essential role in large vessel remodeling,
maintenance of vascular structures, vasculogenesis, and nonsprouting angiogenesis [44,45]. Consistent with these results, we
showed that the expression of Ang-1 and Tie-2 were significantly
increased in the ischemic cerebral cortex by treatment with
morroniside. VEGF is the most important mitogen in the process
of angiogenesis, including microvascular permeability, endothelial
cell proliferation, invasion, migration and survival [40,46]. An
increase in VEGF expression in the infarcted hemisphere has been
described as early as 3 h after an ischemic insult and continued up
to 7 days [47]. Administration of VEGF augmented angiogenesis
in the ischemic penumbra and improve neurological recovery
[48,49]. FGF-2, one of the first discovered angiogenic factors,
mediates vessel growth by stimulating the release of VEGF and
other signaling, and is required for the maintenance of vascular
integrity [50]. NRP-1, expressed in neurons, vessels and astrocytes,
also has angiogenic properties, identified as co-receptors for VEGF
or to form complexes with VEGFR [51]. It has also been reported
to be increased by FGF-2 to enhance vascular smooth muscle cell
migration, besides guidance of endothelial tip cell [52]. After
ischemic insult, NRP-1 was upregulated in endothelial cells of
cerebral blood vessels at the border and in the core of the ischemic
lesion 7 days [53,54]. The results showed that the increased
expression of VEGF, FGF-2, and NRP-1 induced by ischemia
were enhanced after administration of morroniside for 7 days,
indicating that morroniside might promote angiogenesis by

activating the angiogenic signal and releasing the promoters.
Further studies will be needed to investigate how morroniside
interacts with these proteins and the impact of these interactions
on angiogenesis after ischemic injury.
On the basis of these initial results, we concluded that
morroniside could regulate BBB permeability by downregulation
of MMPs and IL-1b during the initial phase following the onset of
focal ischemia; and could promote angiogenesis for BBB
remodeling by activation of EPCs proliferation and increase of
angiogenic promoters expression during the delayed phase.
Accordingly, we propose a new model of the restoration of
microvascular integrity in the neurovascular unit and suggest a
potential treatment strategy that targets the vascular components
in the damaged brain by use of exogenous drugs such as
morroniside to restore neurovascular homeostasis (Figure 6). Our
data suggest that (i) reconstruction of BBB function is necessary for
brain repair after ischemic stroke, and (ii) stroke recovery therapy
should be oriented toward stimulating and prolonging endogenous
neurorepair processes, including neovascularization. One caveat
remains, i.e. the temporal relationship between acute neuroprotection and delayed neurorepair. Treatments with morroniside in
this intial study were started at 3 hours after MCAO. Thus,
overlap between its known acute protective effects and our present
findings of promoted angiogenesis in the delayed phase after stroke
cannot be fully separated, and ultimately, the correlation between
delayed neurorepair effect and self-repair ability still needs to be
fully defined. Further studies to define the exact mechanisms
underlying angiogenic recovery and the vascular signals and
substrates involved in the neurovascular repair are warranted.
