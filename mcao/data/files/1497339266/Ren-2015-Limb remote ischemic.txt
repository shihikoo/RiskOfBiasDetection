Abstract.
Purpose: Limb remote ischemic per-conditioning or post-conditioning has been shown to be neuroprotective after cerebral
ischemic stroke. However, the effect of combining remote per-conditioning with post-conditioning on ischemic/reperfusion
injury as well as the underlying mechanisms are largely unexplored.
Methods: Here, adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The limb ischemic
stimulus was immediately applied after onset of focal ischemia (per-conditioning), followed by repeated short episodes of remote
ischemia 24 hr after reperfusion (post-conditioning). The infarct volume, motor function, and the expression of neuroglobin
(Ngb) were measured at different durations after reperfusion.
Results: We found that a single episode of limb remote per-conditioning afforded short-term protection, but combining repeated
remote post-conditioning during the 14 days after reperfusion significantly ameliorated cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Interestingly, we also found that ischemic per- and post-conditioning significantly increased expression of Ngb, an oxygenbinding globin protein that has been demonstrated to be neuroprotective against stroke, at peri-infarct regions from day 1 to day
14 following ischemia/reperfusion.

neuroprotective strategy against ischemia-reperfusion injury, and Ngb seems to be one of the important players in limb remote
ischemia-mediated neuroprotection.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is the 4th leading cause of death
in the United States and a leading cause of disability worldwide. The most recent major advancement
for ischemic stroke treatment is the administration of
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) intravenously to
dissolve clots. However, tPA appears to be effective
only within the first 4.5 hours after the initial onset of
symptoms (Moskowitz, et al., 2010), and only about
1-2% of stroke patients can benefit from this treatment. Although the understanding the basic molecular
mechanisms underlying neuronal cell death have seen
progress, subsequent clinical trials have been frustrating, and none of the neuroprotective agents have
proven effective. Therefore, widely effective treatments for stroke remain elusive.
Recent studies have shown a new technique called
remote ischemic conditioning, an intrinsic process
whereby repeated short episodes of double-sided
hind limb non-lethal ischemia/reperfusion is neuroprotective after global and focal cerebral ischemic
stroke. Remote ischemic conditioning can be applied
before ischemia (pre-conditioning; PreC), during
ischemia and before reperfusion (per-conditioning;
PerC), or during reperfusion (post-conditioning;
PostC) (Hausenloy and Yellon, 2011). All three remote
ischemic conditioning strategies have similar therapeutic potential, and could trigger innate mechanisms to
protect against brain injury after ischemic stroke (Hoda
et al., 2012; Zhao, 2009). However, ischemic PreC has
limited clinical application due to the unpredictability of the ischemic event. Remote limb ischemic PerC
and PostC are preferred for the treatment of acute
ischemic stroke in the clinical setting as they can be
applied during or after the ischemic period (Gidday,
2006; Veighey and Macallister, 2012; Yu, et al., 2012).
Our group and Hoda et al. reported that remote limb
ischemic per-conditioning ameliorated neuronal injury
after focal ischemic stroke (Hoda, et al., 2014, 2012;
Ren, et al., 2012), and daily remote limb ischemic postconditioning prevented recurrent stroke in intracranial
arterial stenosis patients (Meng, et al., 2012).

Interestingly, Wei et al. reported that remote PerC in
combination with daily remote PostC reduced adverse
left ventricular remodeling and improved survival in a
rat model of myocardial infarction, and that ischemic
conditioning treatment was more effective than a single episode of remote pre-conditioning (Wei, et al.,
2011). This suggests that ischemia PerC in combination with post-conditioning could protect against brain
injury after ischemic stroke. In contrast, another recent
study showed that the combination of remote perconditioning and post-conditioning failed to reduce
infarct size in a rat model of coronary artery occlusion
when compared to the untreated ischemia-reperfusion
rat (Sachdeva, et al., 2014). Thus, whether the combined effect of remote PerC in combination with PostC
on cerebral ischemic injury remains unknown.
Yet, PerC and PostC protect against ischemiareperfusion injury, mechanisms of how blood pressure
cuff inflation on the leg lead to neuroprotection during
ischemic stroke remains largely unexplored. Studies
have shown that ischemia/hypoxia pre-conditioning
could enhance the expression of hypoxia induced
factor-1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Gidday, 2006). Consequently, HIF-1 and
VEGF could increase the expression of neuroglobin
(Ngb), a newly discovered member of the hemebinding globin superfamily (Burmester, et al., 2000;
Haines, et al., 2012; Jin, et al., 2012; Yu, et al., 2012).
In the brain, the functions of Ngb are sensing oxygen,
storage and/or transportation of oxygen, and ROS scavenging (Hua, et al., 2010; Yu, et al., 2012). Our previous
studies have shown that Ngb is an endogenous critical
neuroprotective molecule against ischemic/hypoxic
insults (Jin, et al., 2010; Sun, et al., 2001; Sun, et al.,
2003). Enhanced Ngb gene expression reduced infarct
size and free radical formation following ischemia
in murine experimental models (Khan, et al., 2006;
Li, et al., 2010; Sun, et al., 2003; Wang, et al.,
2008). In addition, overexpression of Ngb in cultured cells can protect neurons against hypoxic insults
(Jin, et al., 2008; Liu, et al., 2009). Given the central
role of Ngb in neuroprotection after ischemic stroke,
we speculated that Ngb might be involved in remote

C. Ren et al. / Limb remote ischemic per-conditioning in combination

per- and/or post-conditioning-mediated neuroprotection.
In this study, we investigated that combined effect
of remote ischemic PerC and PostC on neurological
deficits and on Ngb expression the ischemic brain after
focal ischemia.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Xuanwu Hospital,
Capital Medical University and conducted according
to guidelines by the National Institutes of Health. Adult
male Sprague–Dawley (280 to 320 g) rats were purchased from Vital River, a Charles River company.
Animals were housed in groups of 4 in the same animal
care facility throughout the duration of the study, and
were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle with
unlimited access to food and water. All efforts were
made to minimize any suffering and to reduce the total
number of animals used.
2.2. Focal cerebral ischemia
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (280 to 320 g) were
anesthetized and MCAO was induced by intraluminal occlusion for 90 min using a nylon monofilament
suture as described previous (Zwagerman, et al.). In
brief, the right common carotid artery and the right
external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed. The ECA
was then dissected distally, ligated, and coagulated.
The MCA was occluded using a heparinized intraluminal filament (0.28 mm, rounded tip). After 90 min,
the suture was withdrawn. During the operation, rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5◦ C with
a thermostat-controlled heating blanket. Physiological variables such as blood pressure, and blood gases
(pH, pO2 and pCO2) were monitored before and after
surgical procedures. Sham-operated mice underwent
the identical surgery except that the MCA was not
occluded.
2.3. Remote ischemic per- and post-conditioning
Rats were assigned to four groups including sham
group, ischemic control group, ischemic PerC only
group and ischemic per- and PostC group.
PerC was initiated immediately following the onset
of focal ischemia by bilaterally occluding blood flow

371

to the hind limbs (Zhang, et al., 2014). Hind limb
occlusion was accomplished by tightening a tourniquet (8 mm) around the upper thigh for 3 cycles, with
each occlusion or release phase lasting 10 minutes.
PostC was applied at 1 day after reperfusion and
then repeated every day thereafter up to 14 days.
Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) before PostC, as previously described (Wei, et al., 2011). The sham and
ischemic control groups received the same dosage of
sodium pentobarbital.
2.4. Neurobehavioral test
Neurological deficit was determined through the
neurobehavioral scoring system developed by Belayev
et al. (Belayev, et al., 1996) with modification. The
scoring system was graded on a scale of 0 to 12 (minimal score, 0; maximal score, 12). The tests included (1)
postural reflex test, to examine upper body posture, and
(2) the forelimb placing test, to examine sensorimotor
integration. Eight rats were used for each group.
The ladder rung walking test was also used to assess
deficits in coordination and integration of motor movement and was performed as previously described (Sun,
et al., 2012b). The number of errors and steps of the
affected left forelimb in each trail was counted. Two
trials were averaged to give a mean foot fault score,
and testing was performed at 1, 7, and 14 days after
reperfusion by an investigator who was blinded to
the experimental groups. Higher scores indicate worse
deficits. Eight rats were used for each group.
The elevated body swing test (EBST) was used to
test asymmetric motor behavior (Borlongan and Sanberg, 1995). The rats were held at the base of the tail
and raised 15 cm above the testing surface. The initial
direction of swing is defined as the turning of the upper
body by >10 degrees to either side, and was recorded
in 30 trials per rat. The number of turns to each direction (left or right) was recorded for each rat. The total
number of swings made to the left was divided by 30
(n number of trials) to get a percentage of left-biased
swings. Eight rats were used for each group.
The observer was blinded to the experimental conditions while performing the neurobehavioral tests.
2.5. Histology
Each group rats (N = 5 per group) were anesthetized
and decapitated at day 7 and 14 after MCAO. Brains

372

C. Ren et al. / Limb remote ischemic per-conditioning in combination

were removed and 20-␮m coronal sections were prepared and stained with cresyl violet. Infarct area (7
days after reperfusion) or area of brain injury (14 days
after reperfusion), contralateral hemisphere area, and
total cross-sectional brain area were measured by a
blinded observer using the ImageJ software (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and areas were
multiplied by the distance between sections to obtain
the respective volumes. Infarct volume or area of brain
injury was calculated as a percentage of the volume of
the contralateral hemisphere, as described previously
(Sun, et al., 2012a).

2.6. TUNEL assay
Each group rats (N = 5 per group) were anesthetized and decapitated at day 3 after MCAO. Brains
were removed and 5-␮m coronal paraffin-embedded
sections were prepared. In situ detection of DNA
fragmentation in brain tissues after ischemia was performed using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) detection kits
(Roche. German) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Green-staining cells in the peri-infarct region
were counted as apoptotic cells. The quantitative analysis was expressed using the average of four brain slides,
and each slide included four random fields.

2.7. Measurement of intracellular ROS
Production of ROS was assayed using the ROS Fluorescent Determination Kit (GenMed Scientifics Inc.,
Arlington, MA, USA) (Ren, et al., 2013). At day
3 after MCAO, samples were prepared according to
manufacturer’s instruction. In brief, peri-infarct brain
regions were lysed in Solution C. The obtained supernatant was pipetted into the wells of a 96-flat-bottom
well microtiter plate containing DCF-DA (Solution
C). The samples were incubated for 20 min at 37◦ C
in dark, and then read in a Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash with excitation at 490 nm and emission at
520 nm (Thermo Labsystem, Helsinki, Finland). Total
protein concentration was measured with a Bradford
Kit (GenMed Scientifics Inc., Arlington, MA, USA).
ROS were calculated as absorption value per mg of
protein and expressed as the relative value to the sham
animals. Four rats in each group were used during the
analysis.

2.8. Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was used to assess Ngb
expression. Protein was isolated from the rat periinfarct region at 1, 7, and 14 days after reperfusion.
Protein (20 ␮g) was electrophoresed on 12.5% SDSpolyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corporation, USA). The membrane was probed with rabbit
polyclonal anti-Ngb antibody as described in our previous report (made in-house and validated) (Sun, et al.,
2001). The specific reaction was visualized through the
use of a chemiluminescent substrate (GE Healthcare,
UK). ␤-actin was used to verify equal loading. The
optical density of protein was measured using ImagePro Plus software 5.0 (Rockville, MD, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instruction.
2.9. Immunohistochemical analysis
The rats (N = 5 per group) were anesthetized with
10% chloral hydrate and were subsequently sacrificed
by transcardiac perfusion with physiological saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde dissolved in PBS (pH
7.4). The frozen sections (15 ␮m thick) were incubated
with rabbit polyclonal anti-NGB antibody (1:200 dilution) in PBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100 at 4◦ C
overnight (Sun, et al., 2001). After washing, the sections were subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor
488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature
(Molecular Probes, 1:500). Slides were mounted using
ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Molecular Probes). The quantitative analysis was expressed
using the average of four brain slides. Ngb-positive
signal within the ipsilateral cortex peri-infarct region
were examined and quantified using Image-Pro Plus
software 5.0 in a blinded manner at 1, 7, and 14 days
after reperfusion.
2.10. Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean and standard deviation (Mean ± SD) and statistical tests were performed
with SPSS for Windows, version 19.0 (SPSS Inc.). For
comparison between two groups, Student’s t test was
used. For behavioral tests, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA
was used, followed by the non-parametric MannWhitney test for comparison between two groups. In
all cases, p < 0.05 was the criterion for significance.

3. Results
To determine whether limb remote ischemic PerC
and PostC prevented ischemic injury after focal
ischemia (Fig. 1B), infarct size or area of brain injury
was measured at 7 and 14 days after reperfusion,
respectively.
At day 7 after reperfusion, infarct volume was
significantly reduced in the PerC and PerC+PostC
groups compared with control group (P < 0.01). There
was no significant difference between the PerC and
PerC+PostC groups (P > 0.05) (Fig. 1B and 1C). These
results suggest that PerC or the combination of PerC
with PostC could influence acute histological outcome
after MCAO.
At day 14 after reperfusion, the brain injury volume was significantly reduced in PerC+PostC group
compared with control and PerC groups (P < 0.01)
(Figs. 1D and 1E). However, there was no significant
difference between the control and PerC groups. These
results suggest that only PerC+PostC treatment could
influence long-term histological outcome after MCAO.
To further analyze the neuroprotective effect of lime
remote ischemic PerC and PostC, DNA fragmentation in brain tissues after ischemia was performed
using TUNEL assay. The number of TUNEL-positive
cells in the per-infarct region in the control group
were significantly increased compared to the sham
group (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2A and B). However, PerC and
PostC treatment significantly decreased the number
of TUNEL-positive cells compared with the control
group (P < 0.01) (Fig. 2A and B). There was no significant difference between the PerC and PerC+PostC
groups (P > 0.05).
Subsequently, we measured ROS level in these rats
groups. As shown in Fig. 2C, the ROS level of control group was significantly higher than sham rats
(P < 0.05). The ROS level was significantly repressed
in the PerC group and Per+PostC group compared with
control group or with sham group (P < 0.05). There
was no significant difference between the PerC and
PerC+PostC groups (P > 0.05).
Next, we asked whether combining PerC and PostC
treatment would affect the neurological functional outcome. As shown in Fig. 3A, neurological deficits,
including body posture and sensorimotor integration,
were significantly improved at 7 and 14 days after
reperfusion in the PerC+PostC group, compared with
control group. Similarly, motor deficits were also
improved at 7 and 14 days after PerC+PostC treat-

373

ment based on the ladder walking test (Fig. 3B).
The EBST also showed that PerC+PostC treatment
improved asymmetric motor behavior at 7 and 14 days
after reperfusion (Fig. 3C). However, the PerC only
treatment had no effect on long-term neurological outcome after MCAO (Fig. 3).
Then, we explored the mechanisms underlying
combinatorial therapy-mediated (PerC+PostC) neuroprotection after ischemic stroke. By Western blot
analysis, we found that Ngb expression was significantly increased in the rat brain after focal ischemia,
consistent with a previous finding (Jin, et al., 2010).
The expression of Ngb was increased after PerC treatment at day 1 after reperfusion in peri-infarct region.
Interestingly, Ngb expression dramatically increased
after combination treatment of PerC+PostC at days
7 and 14, compared with sham and ischemic control groups (Fig. 4). However, the expression of Ngb
in PerC group reduced to the baseline level at day 7
and day 14, suggesting that PerC+PostC treatment but
not PerC-only treatment influences Ngb expression.
Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that Ngb
expression was increased in the Perc+PostC group,
compared with sham and control groups (Fig. 5).

4. Discussion
In this study, we found that a single episode of limb
remote per-conditioning afforded short-term protection, but combining repeated remote post-conditioning
during the 14 days after reperfusion significantly ameliorated cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through
increased Ngb expression in the ischemic peri-infarct
region, suggesting the benefit of combination therapy
and Ngb involvement in PerC+PostC-mediated neuroprotection after focal ischemia.
Although pre-conditioning remains one of the most
powerful maneuvers to protect brain damage, it is not
feasible in the clinical setting to pretreat patients prior
to acute ischemic stroke. Therefore, remote PerC and
PostC are more clinically relevant therapies. A clinical study showed that remote PerC applied to the
arm; by means of blood pressure cuff inflation during
ambulance transport (i.e. during ischemia) increased
the mean and median salvage indexes (Botker, et al.,
2010). In addition, our recent study demonstrated that
repeated daily remote PerC by limb ischemia prevents
recurrent stroke in intracranial arterial stenosis patients
(Meng, et al., 2012). Wei et al. reported that a single

early episode of remote PerC reduces infarct size after
myocardial infarction, and repeated remote PostC further reduces adverse left ventricular remodeling and
improves survival in a dose-dependent fashion (Wei,
et al., 2011). Consistent with these findings, our data
show that PerC combined with daily PostC for up to 14
days significantly reduced the brain injury volume and
ameliorated neurological deficits after focal ischemia.
However, a single episode of PerC influence acute
histological outcome after MCAO. Our results suggested that the therapeutic strategy of ischemic PerC
in combination with PostC is necessary for long-term
neuroprotection after MCAO. In contrast, a very recent
study showed that not only remote PerC and PostC
alone failed to reduce infarct size, but the combination
of remote PerC+PostC also failed to reduce infarct size
in a rat model of coronary artery occlusion as compared
to the control group (Sachdeva, et al., 2014). Although

the reason for this discrepancy remains unclear, the
difference in animal species, the degree of ischemic
stimulus, as well as the ischemic model employed may
explain these contradicting results.
Yet, how the protective effect transmitted and
communicated from the distant ischemic-reperfusion
muscle to the brain remains a conundrum. A better
understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying remote ischemic conditioning may
allow us to exploit the neuroprotective effect pharmaceutically. Up to date now, three potential mechanisms
have been proposed: (1) Humoral factors released in
the pre-conditioned organ are transported via the blood
circulation to protect the target organ (Kanoria, et al.,
2007), (2) Neurogenic transmission with involvement
of muscle afferents and the autonomic nervous system (Kanoria, et al., 2007), and (3) Immunomodulation
(Zhao, 2011). However, these proposed theories remain

to be clarified. In addition, several studies indicate
that the underlying protective mechanisms of remote
ischemic conditioning are associated with its ability
to attenuate production of free radicals, promote the
cell survival pathway, modulate the immune system,
or to inhibit the apoptotic cell signaling pathways
(Hoda, et al., 2012; Wang, et al., 2008; Xing, et al.,
2008; Zhao, 2009; Zhao, et al., 2006). Ischemic preconditioning and post-conditioning prevent HIF-1␣
mRNA induction in the rat liver after ischemia and
reperfusion (Knudsen, et al., 2011). HIF-1 is essential
for ischemia-induced angiogenesis, and may also be a
critical mediator of late-phase pre-conditioning (Knudsen, et al., 2011). For these reasons, HIF-1 and the genes
under its control such as Ngb may represent novel therapeutic targets for ameliorating the effects of ischemia in
a variety of clinical settings. In parallel, Ngb has neuroprotective effects against stroke and neurodegenerative
disorders (Burmester, et al., 2000; Yu, et al., 2012). Ngb
expression is increased by neuronal hypoxia in vitro
and focal cerebral ischemia in vivo (Shang, et al., 2006;
Sun, et al., 2001), and Ngb overexpression protects

neuronal cells from hypoxia/ischemia, ROS/NOS, or
␤-amyloid peptides (Jin, et al., 2008; Liu, et al., 2009;
Ren, et al., 2013). Consistently, our data show that
Ngb is significantly increased at 7 and 14 days after
combined remote ischemic conditioning, compared
with ischemic control group suggesting that Ngb may
be involved in PerC+PostC-mediated neuroprotection
after focal ischemia. However, direct causal relationship between Ngb expression and the neuroprotection
of limb remote ischemia conditioning needs to be further confirmed.
In conclusion, our results suggest that the conventional PerC combined with PostC may be used as a
long-term neuroprotective strategy against ischemiareperfusion injury and that Ngb may be one of the many
important players in limb remote ischemia-mediated
neuroprotection. These data may have clinical implications for the treatment of patients with cerebral
ischemic stroke.
