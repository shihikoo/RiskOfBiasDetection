Abstract—Background: Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (IR)
injury is a complex pathological process that can cause irreversible brain damage, neuronal injury or death from brain
ischemia. Rac1 GTPase is involved in cellular protection
from IR injury. However, the mechanism of protection and
the molecules aﬀected by Rac1 remain to be deﬁned. Methods and results: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to middle
cerebral artery occlusion for 1 h, followed by 24-h reperfusion. In this in vivo model of cerebral IR injury, mice treated
with the Rac GTPase inhibitor NSC23766 or Rac1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) had better short-term (72 h) neurologic
scores, less infarction volume, higher production of antioxidant enzymes, lower lipid peroxide, and reduced apoptosis
compared with a vehicle-treated group or a control-siRNA
group. However, long-term (14 day) neurologic scores were
worse for the two treatments compared to controls. Microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
revealed that Notch2 was downregulated under NSC23766
treatment. Notch2 protein levels decreased with NSC23766
and Rac1 siRNA in vitro and in vivo. Cell survival increased
with the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT or Notch2 siRNA
and NICD2 attenuated the NSC23766 eﬀect. In addition,
immunoblotting showed that DAPT and Notch2 siRNA changed the levels of apoptosis-regulating proteins. NFkB mediated Rac1, which regulated Notch2 in an oxygen glucose
deprivation model. Both inhibitors of Notch2 and Rac1
enhanced neural stem cell diﬀerentiation. Conclusions: This
study demonstrated the importance of Rac1 regulation of
Notch2 in mediating cerebral IR-induced production of injurious reactive oxygen species and cell death in vitro and
in vivo in the short term. Targeted inhibition of Rac1 or
Notch2 is new avenue for in vivo therapy aimed at protecting

INTRODUCTION
Cerebral ischemia reperfusion (IR) is a major cause of
neuronal injury and functional impairment. IR results in
cerebral infarction, which is the leading cause of death
and adult disability worldwide (Schaller and Graf, 2004).
During IR injury, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated, initiating a series of cellular events leading to
inﬂammation, necrosis, and apoptosis, which contribute
to tissue injury (Kalogeris et al., 2012). The small GTPase
Rac1 has been implicated, along with other intracellular
enzymes, in the regulation of ROS generation in many cell
types including neurons (Archer and Bar-Sagi, 2002).
Rho-family GTPases are crucial at multiple steps of
neural development such as neurite outgrowth and
diﬀerentiation, axon pathﬁnding, and dendritic spine
formation and maintenance (Sebok et al., 1999; Govek,
2005). Rac1, like other members of the Rho GTPase
family, cycles between an inactive (GDP-bound) state
and active (GTP-bound) state after a signal is received
(Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002). Rac1 controls a variety of functions associated with multiple downstream
eﬀectors such as PAK and JNKs 1 and 2, which stimulate
diﬀerent signaling cascades (Kaempchen et al., 2003).
Previous studies showed that Rac1 is involved in the survival and proliferation of progenitor cells in the subventricular zone of lateral ventricles (V-SVZ) and the neurite
outgrowth of V-SVZ-derived neurons (Khodosevich and
Monyer, 2010). However, several studies reported
opposing ﬁndings about neurite formation and neurite
outgrowth, possibly due to diversity in animal models, cell
types or ages, or organisms used for primary cell studies
(Kubo et al., 2002; Fournier et al., 2003; Schwamborn and
Puschel, 2004). Rac1 is an important source of ROS in an
in vivo model of hepatic IR (Ozaki et al., 2000). Zhang
et al. reported that inhibition of Rac1 protects hippocampus CA1 from delayed neuronal cell death following global
cerebral ischemia (Zhang et al., 2009). Limor et al.
showed that Rac1 mediated IR by inducing NADPH oxidase activation and ROS generation, as well as oxidative
stress in the CA1 region (Raz et al., 2010). However, the

involvement of Rac1 in short-term or long-term cerebral
IR-induced cell apoptosis and degradation is unknown.
The expression and activity of Notch2 is induced by
ischemic injury in postmitotic neurons (Alberi et al.,
2010). Notch2 also regulates morphogenesis of Bergmann glia cells (Estrada et al., 2007) and inhibits granule
neuron diﬀerentiation in the cerebellum (Solecki et al.,
2001). Notch proteins and ligands are present in the central nervous system throughout the lifetime (Presente
et al., 2001) and are actively involved in dynamic changes
in the nervous system architecture and function. Notch
signaling is critically important for organogenesis, regulating many cellular processes essential to development
such as self-renewal, diﬀerentiation, and apoptosis
(Zhou et al., 2010). Notch controls neurogenesis, the
growth of axons and dendrites, synaptic plasticity and
neuronal death. In this study, we investigated the importance of Rac1 in IR injury and Rac1 regulation through
Notch2 in the short-term and long-term response to ischemia in a mouse model of cerebral IR.

by withdrawal of the thread. Body temperature was maintained around 37 ± 0.5 °C throughout the surgical procedure and for 2 h after the start of reperfusion using a
heated surgical platform. Sham controls were performed
using the same surgical procedures without artery
occlusion. The sham operation group and the IR model
group received intracerebroventricular injections of physiological saline at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 h after surgery.
Rac1 small-interfering RNA (siRNA) was 10-nmol endphosphorothioated Rac1 antisense oligonucleotides in 10
lL TE buﬀer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA). The
sequence for Rac1 siRNA was 50 -ACTTGATGGCCTG
CAT-30 (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville,
IA, USA) and control siRNA was 50 -GTATGGGACTC
TACCT-30 . The NSC23766 Rac1 inhibitor (50 mM),
control siRNA, and Rac1 siRNA were administered
intracerebroventricularly at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 h after
surgery. Animals were assessed for neuroprotection and
sacriﬁced at 72 h. Each group consisted of 10 mice.
Brains were dissected to determine biochemical
parameters, histopathology and cerebral infarct size.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals

Neurobehavioral function assessment

Male, 4-week-old C57BL/6 J mice were purchased from
the Shanghai Experimental Animal Center, Chinese
Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Before
beginning the study, mice were allowed to adapt to the
environment for 7 days; healthy mice weighing 19.4
± 1.8 g were selected for experiments. Mice were
housed in an air-conditioned environment with constant
temperature and a standard light/dark schedule. All
animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee and Ethics Committee
of Harbin Medical University and were in accordance
with the guidelines of the Animal Experiment Center of
Harbin Medical University. All eﬀorts were made to
minimize the number of animals used and their suﬀering.

Neurobehavioral function was evaluated with Bederson’s
test and the cerebral infarction volume was observed with
tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Neurological behavior
was scored at 72 h or 14 d after cerebral IR by a
researcher blinded to the experiment according to the
modiﬁed Bederson’s test (Zhang et al., 1997). A score
of 0 indicated no observable neurological functional
deﬁcit; 1 indicated inability to extend the forepaw fully; 2
indicated decreased resistance to lateral push without
circling; 3 indicated movement without clear direction; 4
meant the mouse did not walk spontaneously; and 5
included a depressed level of consciousness. Higher
scores indicated greater neurobehavioral dysfunction.
To determine the infarction area, brain tissue was
removed, sliced into successive 2.0-mm coronal
sections and stained with 2% TTC solution 10 min at
37 °C and ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde at room
temperature overnight (Bederson et al., 1986a; Longa
et al., 1989). Infarction areas were quantiﬁed using Image
J software. Data were expressed as the average
infarction area of each group.

Mouse modeling and treatment
Experiments used 5-week-old C57BL/6 J mice,
anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of chloral
hydrate (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland; 80 g/L
in saline solution; 0.4 ml/100 g body weight). As shown
in Fig. 1, cerebral ischemia was induced in weightmatched mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion using
the intraluminal thread technique described previously
(Belayev et al., 1996). Right middle cerebral artery ischemia was maintained for 1 h and blood ﬂow was restored

brain tissue and cell homogenates were measured using
commercially available kits (SOD and MDA assay kits,
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; GSH-Px Assay kit,
EIAAB). SOD assays used a xanthine oxidase method,
GSH-Px assays used a dithio-dinitrobenzoic acid method,
and MDA assays used a thiobarbituric acid method.
Cell apoptosis detection
Apoptotic cells in tissues were detected by in situ terminal
deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated
biotinylated
deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL)
assays (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Brain paraﬃn sections
taken 72 h after sham operation or IR were
deparaﬃnized with dimethylbenzene, hydrated with
gradient ethanol and washed with distilled water. For
positive controls, 1 lg/ml DNase I was added to
sections; sections treated without TdT were used as
negative controls. Under a 400-fold immunoﬂuorescent
microscope (wavelength 488 nm), apoptosis cells had
ﬂuorescent yellow-green nuclei.
For cultured cells, cells were washed twice with
phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS), harvested, and
centrifuged at 3500g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were
incubated in 1 Annexin V buﬀer using Alexa Fluor 488
Annexin V/Dead Cell Apoptosis Kits (V13241, Life
Technologies, Oregon, USA) containing Annexin V and
propidium iodide for 15 min. Stained cells were
quantiﬁed with a FacsCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, St. Jose, CA, USA) using 10,000 cells per
measurement.
IR in vivo model and cortical neural stem cell primary
cultures
Primary dissociated mouse hippocampal CA1 region
isolated from neonatal (P1) mice were prepared as
described previously (Bellin et al., 2012). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium containing
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1 lg/ml
penicillin/streptomycin and plated in poly-D-lysine coated
24-well plates at seeding density 3.0  105 cells/ml.
IR was simulated with in vitro oxygen glucose
deprivation (OGD), similar to a previous study (Copin
et al., 1998). Normal media were replaced with lowglucose Hank’s balanced salt solution containing
1.8 mmol/L Ca2+, 0.8 mmol/L Mg2+, and 0.2 g/L
D-glucose. Chambers were ﬂushed with 95% N2/5%
CO2 for 5 min, sealed, and placed in a 37 °C incubator
to simulate ischemia. At the end of simulated ischemia,
low-glucose medium was replaced with normal culture
medium for 30 min at 37 °C for a reperfusion period. Cells
were treated with control siRNA, Rac1 siRNA, Notch
siRNA (250 nM), the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766
(100 lM), the Notch inhibitor DAPT (10 lM) and Notch2
(NICD2) (25 lM) in vitro to mimic the conditions and
treatment of the in vivo groups.
Primary neural stem cells were prepared from mouse
embryonic brains (E14) and grown as neurospheres as
described previously (Nho et al., 2010). Cells were cultured in NSC basal medium (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, BC, Canada) with EGF (20 ng/ml, Invitrogen,

Carlsbad, CA, USA), seeded in 12-well plates with a
seeding density of 3.0  104 cells/ml, and incubated in a
37 °C humidiﬁed 5% CO2 incubator. In vitro neurosphere
formation was observed microscopically after 3 days.
Western blots
Brain tissue was homogenized by adding to protein
extraction buﬀer at 1:5 to tissue weight in a glass
homogenizer. Hippocampal neurons or neural stem cells
were lysed directly by lysis buﬀer. Sample protein
concentrations were determined using BCA protein
assay kits. Homogenate samples (50 lg) were mixed
with an equal volume of sample buﬀer and heated at
95 °C for 5 min before loading on 10% sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE)
gels and transferring to polyvinyl diﬂuoride (PVDF)
membranes. Membranes were blocked with PBS-tween
(PBST) containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and
incubated in primary antibody: Rac1-GTP (1:1000,
Neweast Bioscience), Rac1 (1 lg/ml, Abcam), tubulin
(1:5000, Abcam), cleaved caspase-3 (1:200, Abcam),
Bax (1 lg/ml, Abcam), Bcl-2 (0.5 lg/ml, Abcam), Notch2
(1:400, Abcam), nuclear factor kappaB (NFkB)-p65
(0.5 lg/ml, Abcam), Hes1 and Hey1 (1:700, Aviva
Systems Biology, San Diego, CA), Sox4 (1 lg/ml,
Abcam), SSEA1 (2 lg/ml, Novus), or Nanog (1:1000,
Abcam) for 1 h at room temperature or 4 °C overnight.
After washing three times with PBST, membranes were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buﬀer (1:1000)
for 1 h and washed three times in PBST. Tubulin was
used as a loading control and to normalize protein
expression levels. Proteins were visualized using an
ECL chemiluminescence system (ECL plus; Amersham
Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and band densities were
quantiﬁed using image analysis software (AlphaEase FC).
Measurement of intracellular ROS
ROS was assessed using the ﬂuorescent probe Dichlorodihydro-ﬂuorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) (Invitrogen),
which has an acetate group cleaved by esterases in
cells; subsequent oxidation yields a ﬂuorescent adduct.
For ﬂow cytometry analysis, cells (2  105) were seeded
in 6-well plates overnight, then 50 lM DCF-DA was
added for 30 min and cells washed with PBS,
trypsinized, and collected in 0.5 ml of PBS for
immediate measurement by ﬂow cytometry (BD
Biosciences) with a 488-nm excitation laser. Data were
acquired and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD
Biosciences).
RNA isolation and microarrays
RNA was extracted from primary neurons with RNeasy
Mini Kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The quality and
quantity of RNA was measured using a Nanodrop ND1000 UV-spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies,
Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA integrity was determined on
1% formaldehyde-containing agarose gels. Microarray
experiments were performed essentially as described

previously (Kugita et al., 2011). In brief, 500-ng RNA from
primary neurons of controls and cells treated with
NSC23766 for 24 h was labeled with Cy3-ﬂuorescence
dye. Cy3-labeled RNA were hybridized onto 44 K whole
mouse genome microarray gene expression chips following the manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). Chips were scanned using a
DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies).
Microarray data were analyzed by feature extraction
software (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) and
diﬀerential expression between NSC23766-treated and
control groups was calculated using linear models for
microarray analysis (Smyth, 2005).

of the reporter vectors (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Dualluciferase assay kits (Promega) were used according to
the manufacturer’s instructions at 48 h post transfection.
All transfections were performed in triplicate with at least
duplicate independent experiments.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
The EMSA procedure was followed as previously
described (Wang et al., 2013). A monoclonal anti-NFkB
antibody (Upstate Biotechnologies) was used for supershifts. Reactions contained 15-lg nuclear extract of cells.
ChIP-qPCR

Reverse transcription PCR, qPCR analysis and
validation of microarray data
Microarray expression data were validated by
reassessing the expression patterns of 27 diﬀerentially
expressed transcripts (Table 3) using quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR). From control and NSC23766treated groups, 1-lg total RNA was converted to DNA
using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Samples were
subjected to real-time PCR analysis with FastStart
SYBR Green PCR Master (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) using a 7000 Real-time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems) and 400 nM gene-speciﬁc primers per
reaction. PCR reactions of 25 ll were ampliﬁed for at
95 °C for 10 min followed by 35 cycles at 95 °C for
30 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 45 s with ﬁnal
elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. Results were analyzed
using SDS 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems).
Diﬀerences in the cycle threshold (Ct) values were used
to determine relative expressions. All measurements
were done in triplicate and three independent
experiments were performed. Primers used are listed in
Table 4.
NFkB luciferase reporter assays
Luciferase reporter gene assays were performed as
reported (Liu et al., 2013). In brief, cells (1  104 per well)
were cultured in 96-well plates. Luciferase reporter vectors (0.8 mg per well) (pNFkBTal-Luc, BD Biosciences;
and pGL3-Basic, Promega, Southampton, UK) were
cotransfected using Lipofectamine transfection reagent
with 0.008 mg per well pSV40-Renilla (Promega), an
internal control for normalizing the transcriptional activity

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed as
described previously (Wang et al., 2013). Each sample
contained 1  107 treated cells. NFkB antibody was from
Cell Signaling. Cleaned and concentrated DNA was
prepared and subject to PCR.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was by Prism 5 software and all results
expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Statistical analysis of variance used was a one-way
ANOVA. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005 was used
as the level of signiﬁcance.

RESULTS
Inhibition of Rac1 enhanced postischemic recovery
in the short-term but not the long-term
After cerebral IR damage and treatment, mice were
assessed manually using the Bederson scoring scheme
at 72 h and 14 d. Infarct areas were conﬁrmed by TTC
staining at 72 h after reperfusion. Table 1 shows that
neurological behavior scores and infarct areas for the IR
model group were signiﬁcantly higher than for the shamoperation group (P < 0.05) at 72 h. The control siRNAtreated IR group did not show altered neurological
deﬁcits or IR-induced cerebral injury. In the groups
receiving treatment after cerebral IR, mice receiving the
Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 showed lower neurological
behavior scores and smaller infarct areas (P < 0.05)
compared with the model group. The Rac1 siRNA group
showed similar eﬀects as the NSC23766 group
(P < 0.05) when compared with the control siRNA
group. However, the neurological behavior scores of the

NSC23766 and Rac1 siRNA groups were signiﬁcantly
higher (P < 0.05) than the IR and control siRNA groups
at day 14 after reperfusion (Table 1).
The main eﬀects of treatment were also signiﬁcant by
biochemical indexes after 72 h of cerebral IR damage
both in vivo, measured with brain tissue, and in vitro,
measured using hippocampal neurons. Table 2 shows
that the activities of SOD and GSH-Px in the IR or OGD
group
were

(P < 0.05)
compared with the sham-operation group, whereas
MDA content increased (P < 0.05). Control siRNA did

OGD group. However, in groups treated with NSC23766
or Rac siRNA group, SOD and GSH-Px activity were
signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.05) than in the IR or OGD
and control siRNA groups and the increase in MDA
content was signiﬁcantly reduced (P < 0.05) (Table 2).

Rac1 activation induced neural cell apoptosis
following cerebral IR
To characterize Rac1 modulation following cerebral IR,
we examined Rac1 levels and Rac1 GTPase activation
after 24 h of cerebral IR. As shown in Fig. 2A, Rac1
siRNA strongly decreased total Rac1 protein
expression. A low baseline level of Rac1 activity,
measured as Rac1-GTP, was seen in the shamoperation group, while Rac1 activity was elevated in
ischemic animals at 24 h after reperfusion in the IR
group. Treatment with control siRNA did not alter Rac1
activity in the IR group. Activated Rac1 was decreased
with NSC23766 or Rac1 siRNA compared with the IR
and control siRNA groups (Fig. 2A).
In vivo neural cells, TUNEL staining for cell apoptosis
showed that deﬁciency of Rac1 after NSC23766 or Rac1
siRNA treatment decreased the number of TUNELpositive cells that protect neurons from apoptotic cell
death, at 72 h after cerebral IR (Fig. 2B). Apoptotic
stimuli activate apoptosis-related proteins such as
Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma 2

(Bcl-2) to activate the caspase cascade and its
substrates to trigger apoptosis. Therefore, we examined
the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3. Consistent
with the TUNEL-staining results, NSC23766 and Rac1
siRNA increased Bcl-2 expression and blocked Bax and
cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 2C). We also isolated mouse
hippocampal neurons for an in vitro OGD model. Rac1
inhibition by NSC23766 (12.1%) or Rac1 siRNA (11.3%)
decreased the number of apoptotic cells after cerebral
IR (Fig. 2D) compared with the model (29.1%) and
control siRNA groups (21.3%). In vitro, the level of
apoptosis-related proteins showed similar results as
treatment with NSC23766 or Rac1 siRNA in vivo
(Fig. 2E).
Rac1 activity correlated with intracellular ROS level in
neural cells
To examine Rac1 in OGD-induced oxidative stress, we
measured intracellular levels of ROS after Rac1
inhibition. Primary cultured hippocampal neurons were
exposed to OGD to induce neuronal damage, followed
by treatment with NSC23766, control siRNA or Rac1
siRNA. Cells undergoing OGD increased ROS
production (Fig. 3). Treatment with the Rac1 inhibitor
NSC23766 decreased ROS levels. Treatment with Rac1
siRNA also decreased intracellular ROS after OGD
compared to treatment with control siRNA.
Rac1 regulated Notch2 signaling following cerebral
IR injury in vivo and in vitro
To obtain a global view of genes regulated by Rac1, we
carried out gene expression proﬁling of primary neurons
isolated from the hippocampus as an in vitro model of
OGD, under OGD conditions or NSC23766 treatment
after 24 h incubation as the OGD model. We identiﬁed a
group of genes whose expression was induced or
suppressed by NSC23766. Among a total of 27 genes
(12 upregulated and 15 downregulated) (Table 3), we
found that Notch2 was 5.6-fold downregulated in

We used realtime PCR to verify the RNA level of these
genes. Notch2 showed >eightfold downregulation by
qPCR analysis. These results were consistent with the
microarray results (Fig. 4A) and suggested possible
Notch2 involvement in the pathway regulating Rac1
functions. Hes1 and Hey1, canonical targets of Notch,
were up-regulated for 7.05- and 7.2-folds, respectively.

Notch2 and the Notch2 intracellular domain (NICD2),
which is the activated form of the Notch2 receptor, as
well as Hes1 and Hey1 in the IR or OGD model under
various treatments in vivo and in vitro. Notch2, NICD2,
Hes1 and Hey1 were highly expressed in the model and
control siRNA-treated groups. However, the NSC23766
group and Rac1 siRNA group showed signiﬁcantly
blocked expression of Notch2, NICD2, Hes1 and Hey1
in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 4B, C).
In the in vitro model of OGD (Fig. 5A), either inhibition
of the Notch signaling pathway with DAPT (9.4%) or
speciﬁc inhibition of Notch2 with Notch2 siRNA (8.6%)
prevented neuron death following OGD compared to
model (31.2%) or control siRNA (23.5%) groups.
Hippocampal neurons in normal culture conditions
showed 4.5% cell death. NSC23766 counteracted the
eﬀect of NICD2-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, treated
cells in the OGD showed higher expression of Notch2

compared to cells in normal culture conditions excluding
the Notch2-siRNA group. No change in Rac1expression
or Rac1 activity was seen in the OGD model or
treatments with OGD. Inhibition of the Notch signaling
pathway or Notch2 decreased expression of cleaved
caspase 3 and Bax, but increased expression of Bcl2
(Fig. 5B).
NFkB activation was regulated by Rac1 and required
for Notch2
To determine whether Rac1 or Notch2 were involved in
regulating OGD-induced NFkB activity, we tested NFkB
translocation, NFkB transcriptional activity and NFkB
occupancy after treatment with DAPT, Rac1 siRNA, or
NSC23766 or in an OGD model with the same
treatments. We investigated the localization of NFkB
after OGD by Western blot. Cytoplasmic and nuclear
extracts (Fig. 6A) of cells with or without OGD treated
with Notch or Rac1 inhibitors showed decreased NFkB
nuclear localization but no change in cytoplasmic location.
Dual luciferase assays were used to examine NFkB
transcriptional activity. No diﬀerence in NFkB activity
was seen for the treatments without OGD, but NFkB
activity was increased after OGD (Fig. 6B). After OGD,
cells treated with DAPT, Rac1 siRNA or NSC23766

showed NFkB decreased transcriptional activity
compared to cells in OGD. Moreover, EMSA was used
to further test the NFkB occupancy, a shift band was
observed in control cells. The shift band was stronger
after OGD, suggesting the binding ability of NFkB was
enhanced after OGD. DAPT, Rac1 siRNA or NSC23766
decreased binding ability of NFkB when cells were
subjected OGD (Fig. 6D). To determine if NOTCH2
alterations were occurring in cells when NFkB
expression or activity changed, we performed ChIPqPCR using anti-NFkB p65 on treated cells to determine
relative NKkB occupancy of NOTCH2. Increases in
NFkB occupancy were seen at predicted NOTCH2
binding sites in OGD cells relative to control cells and
the increase was partially inhibited when Rac1
expression or activity was inhibited by siRNA or
NSC23766 (Fig. 6C). These results indicated that
NOTCH2 had a NFkB p65-binding site. Furthermore,
ChIP was performed using NFkB p65 antibody to test
NFkB binding NOTCH2 gene expression in varies
treatments. Fig. 6E showed that the gene expression of
NOTCH2 was enhanced in OGD cells. DAPT, Rac1
siRNA or NSC23766 decreased NOTCH2 expression in
cells with or without OGD. Results above suggested
that NOTCH2 expression is regulated by Rac1 activity
via NFkB.

Activation of Notch2 was involved in proliferation
and self-renewal in neuron stem-like cells
To determine if Rac1 or Notch2 was critical for
proliferation and self-renewal of neuron stem-like cells,
we inhibited Rac1 and Notch2 expression with speciﬁc
siRNA and examined changes in levels of the known
self-renewal-related proteins Sox4, SSEA1, Nanog. As
shown in Fig. 7B, treatment with Rac1 or Notch2 siRNA
inhibited the sphere-forming ability of neuron stem-like
cells at the single-cell levels, a measure of self-renewal
potential. NICD2 attenuated Rac1 inhibition. To
demonstrate the penetration of NICD2, Hes1 and Hey1
gene, which are downstream of Notch2, were tested by
RT-PCR and the results showed the Hes1 and Hey1
expression increased in NICD2 incubated cells,
indicating NICD2 penetrated into cells (Fig. 7A).
Consistent with these results, the expression of Sox4,
SSEA1 and Nanog was higher in sphere-forming
neuron-like cells, but reduced by treatment with DAPT,
Notch2 siRNA or Rac1 siRNA except for the
combination Rac1 siRNA and NICD2 group (Fig. 7C).

DISCUSSION
The present study adds evidence to growing knowledge
of the crucial role of Rac1 in cerebral injury. To clarify
the participation of Rac1 in recovery after cerebral IR in
mice, we used behavioral, biochemical, and cellular
approaches in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggested that
changes in Rac1 activity regulated Notch2 and were
involved in neurodegenerative processes after cerebral
IR in the short term, but delayed long-term recovery.
Neurological scores are used to evaluate
neuroprotective eﬀects indicated by animal behavior
(Longa et al., 1989) (Bederson et al., 1986b). Neurologic
deﬁcit scores for 10 mice in the model group (Table 1) had
an average of 2.85 ± 0.52. Neurological scores were
improved by treatment with NSC23766 or Rac1 siRNA
at 72 h, when mild deﬁcits were observed. However, at
day 14, poor neurological scores increased under Rac1inhibition conditions. In addition to aﬀecting neurologic
deﬁcit scores at 72 h, NSC23766 and Rac1 siRNA significantly inhibited cerebral infarcts induced by IR damage,
as demonstrated by infarct volume measurements. These
results indicated that Rac1 contributed to short-term
recovery after injury induced by cerebral IR but delayed
recovery of long-term damage.
MDA participates in injury and SOD and GSH-Px
block this process during cerebral IR injury. SOD activity
decrease and some antioxidants upregulate SOD gene
expression in mice after IR injury. GSH-Px gives better
protection against oxidative stress than SOD. MDA, one
of the most sensitive indicators of lipid peroxidation
(Gutteridge, 1995), increases after IR injury. Limor et al.
showed Rac1 is important for oxidase activation (Raz
et al., 2010). Our experiments suggested that free radical
production might be important as a modulator after periods of cerebral IR. The eﬀects of NSC23766 and Rac
siRNA on brain MDA content, SOD activity, and GSHPx levels in occlusion-reperfusion mice were examined

111

in vivo and an in vitro which showed an increase of
MDA in IR or OGD model group (P < 0.05), while SOD
and GSH-Px activity decreased (P < 0.05). The MDA,
SOD and GSH-Px results were consistent with the
observed reduction in cerebral infarction and the neurological recovery results. These data suggested that the
antioxidant properties of the Rac1 inhibitor could be
important in protecting neurons, possibly by increasing
the endogenous defensive capacity of the brain to combat
oxidative stress induced by cerebral IR.
Previous studies showed the importance of apoptosis
in IR injury. We also observed apoptosis in our model of
IR injury, as seen by a high percentage of TUNELpositive cells. The elevated Rac GTPase activation
appeared to contribute to pathology following ischemic
stress as evidenced by our ﬁnding that administration of
the Rac GTPase inhibitor NSC23766 or Rac1 antisense
oligonucleotides attenuated apoptotic neuronal cell
death following IR. ROS can result in both apoptosis
and necrosis and the ability of NSC23766 and Rac1
siRNA to inhibit IR-induced ROS production might be
the underlying mechanism for their protective eﬀects
against apoptosis and necrosis. In addition, we found
that neuronal degeneration in the hippocampal region
was inhibited by pretreatment with the RacGTPase
inhibitor before IR.
We found that Rac1 inactivation protected neuron
degradation. We further found evidence for a novel link
between Rac1 and Notch2 regulation. Notch2 was downregulated and inactivated in response to knockdown of
Rac1. Notch is important in all tissues and the beneﬁcial
eﬀects of Notch ligands may involve responses in the
vascular, immune and nervous systems. In vitro data
suggested that the Notch receptor is important in the
response to OGD. Hes1 and Hey1, downstream
eﬀectors of Notch, are crucial transcriptional factors that
are responsible for the maintenance of neural stem cells,
resulting in an important role in neural development
(Kageyama et al., 2008; Osathanon et al., 2013). Our data
on apoptosis indicated that Rac1 and Notch inhibitors
stimulated regenerative responses to the oxygen deprivation that follows ischemia.
Rac1 has a major role in activating NFkB-mediated
transcription in multiple systems (Sulciner et al., 1996;
Arbibe et al., 2000). We conﬁrmed this result in a primary
hippocampal neurons OGD model by NFkB activity examination, NFkB translocation, NFkB transcriptional activity
and NFkB occupancy. Notch signaling is reported to be
regulated by NFkB through diﬀerent mechanisms in
diverse experimental models (Osipo et al., 2007). Moreover, Notch 2 is stimulated by NFkB to cooperate in marginal zone B-cell development (Moran et al., 2007). We
hypothesized that Rac1 regulated Notch2 through NFkB
in a neuron OGD model, so we treated the OGD model
with DAPT or a Rac1 inhibitor. The results conﬁrmed
our hypothesis that Rac1 regulated Notch2 through
NFkB, mediating their regulation in a neuron OGD model.
It is reported that neural stem cells migrate into the
ischemic region and diﬀerentiate into astrocytes and
neurons, and thereby potentially improve neurologic
function after cerebral ischemia (Dai et al., 2013). Neural

stem cell transplantation therapy reduced ischemic brain
injury, due to the increased angiogenesis and neurogenesis (Tang et al., 2014). We therefore investigated regulation of Rac1 by Notch2 in neural stem cell diﬀerentiation.
Since treatment with siRNA speciﬁcally targeted to
Notch2 resulted in downregulation of Rac1, Rac1 might
be directly involved in downregulation of self-renewalrelated proteins, suppressing sphere formation. Our ﬁndings are supported by previous studies that found that
downregulation of Sox4, SSEA1 and Nanog led to a
decrease in sphere formation (Yamada et al., 2011).
Expression of these self-renewal-related proteins was
seen in the absence of injury, indicating that suppressed
Rac1 or Notch signaling might regulate the activity or differentiation of neural stem cells. These cells can migrate
and diﬀerentiate into astrocytes and neurons, and thereby
intervened the functional recovery from ischemia injury.
In this study, we investigated the mechanisms
underlying the loss of Rac1 in cerebral IR. Rac1
inhibition reduced the infarction volume of cerebral IR
damage and improved neurologic deﬁcits in the short
term but not the long term. Our results also indicated
beneﬁcial eﬀects of Rac1 or Notch2 inhibitors on
neuroprotection, related to ROS. In addition, we found
that Rac1 regulated Notch2 through NFkB in an OGD
model. Targeted inhibition of Rac1 or Notch2, which
regulates the fate of neural stem cells, protected neuron
degradation and enhanced neural stem cell activity and
could provide a new avenue for in vivo therapy aimed at
protecting organs at risk of IR injury.
