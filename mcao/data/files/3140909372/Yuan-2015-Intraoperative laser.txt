Abstract. Rodent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model is commonly used in stroke research.
Creating a stable infarct volume has always been challenging for technicians due to the variances of animal
anatomy and surgical operations. The depth of filament suture advancement strongly influences the infarct volume as well. We investigated the cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in the affected cortex using laser speckle
contrast imaging when advancing suture during MCAO surgery. The relative CBF drop area (CBF50 , i.e., the
percentage area with CBF less than 50% of the baseline) showed an increase from 20.9% to 69.1% when the
insertion depth increased from 1.6 to 1.8 cm. Using the real-time CBF50 marker to guide suture insertion during
the surgery, our animal experiments showed that intraoperative CBF-guided surgery could significantly improve
the stability of MCAO with a more consistent infarct volume and less mortality. © 2015 Society of Photo-Optical

Introduction

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality
worldwide. An animal model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) has been considered as an effective alternative
to study the mechanisms and therapy of ischemic stroke.1 So
far, the intraluminal filament rodent MCAO model introduced
by Koizumi et al.2 and modified by Longa et al.3 has been
the most widely used method for its advantages of no craniotomy and the applicability for inducing reperfusion.4
To ensure a successful and stable MCAO, the depth of filament insertion from the bifurcation of the common carotid artery
(CCA) toward the middle cerebral artery (MCA) should be carefully controlled.5 However, in practice, the variance of infarct
volume induced by MCAO is high due to the variability in animal weight, brain vascular anatomy, suture material, filament
insertion depth, and surgical operations.6–10 Nevertheless, the
conventional intraluminal filament MCAO model often simply
calibrates suture with the same insertion depth, which ignores
the aforementioned variability across animals. Furthermore,
the success of occlusion can be confirmed mainly by postoperative methods including behavior tests, imaging technologies,
e.g., computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), and/or histologic analysis. So far, the only intraoperative
method for confirming the success of MCAO is to use the laser
Doppler flowmetry (LDF) to check the cerebral blood flow
(CBF) drop in MCA immediately after the surgery. However,
due to the high sensitivity to motion and the lack in spatial resolution, LDF in most cases could only be used as a postsurgical
confirmation.11

Our previous work has reported the success of the twodimensional technique of laser speckle contrast imaging
(LSCI) of CBF as an early and real-time predictor of ischemic
lesion after stroke in MCAO surgery.12 Compared with LDF,
LSCI provides full-field CBF information with high spatial
and temporal resolution.13 Experiments indicated that the area
with more than 50% CBF drop at the first minute immediately
after the occlusion had significant prognostic value in lesion volume 24 h after stroke.12 With these inspirations, we propose to
use real-time LSCI to guide the MCAO surgery so as to adjust
the filament insertion depth accordingly to improve the consistency of the lesion. The ultimate goal of our work is to improve
the stability of the intraluminal MCAO model and provide a
CBF-guide strategy for neurovascular surgery through intraoperative LSCI.

control system, FHC Inc., Bowdoin, Maine). All procedures
were performed under standard sterile precautions. The rat
was placed in a stereotaxic frame (Leica Microsystems Inc.,
Buffalo Grove, Illinois). A midline incision was made on the
scalp, and the tissues over bones were cleaned with a blade.
A cranial window centered at 3.5-mm posterior to the bregma
over the cortex was thinned by a high-speed dental drill (Fine
Science Tools Inc., North Vancouver, Canada) with ∅1.4-mm
steel burr until the cortical vessels were clearly visible. Saline
was used to cool down the skull during thinning. Then a cylinder
base was fixed onto the skull over the cranial window with reinforced glass ionomer cement (Dental Materials Factory of
Shanghai Medical Instruments Co., Shanghai, China) as we
did in the previous study.12 After the cement hardened, the rat
was placed in a supine position and a full-field LSCI CBF
imager (RatCap-3, Dolphin BioTech Ltd., Shanghai, China)
was connected to the cylinder base to acquire intraoperative
real-time cortical CBF images.12,13 During the experiment, the
rat skull was illuminated by a 780-nm laser diode (L780P010,
Thorlabs Inc., Newton, New Jersey) and the laser speckle
images (640 × 640 pixels) were acquired at 40 fps.

Real Time Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging

The theories and technical details of LSCI have been documented in the literature.14,15 In this study, the contrast value
K was calculated using temporal laser speckle contrast analysis
with 320 frames after registration.16 K 2 is inversely proportional

where T is the exposure time of the CCD and the autocorrelation
time τc is inversely proportional to the CBF velocity. β is a constant accounting for the loss of correlation. All data were analyzed with MATLAB® software (Ver. R2013b, Mathworks Inc.,

2.3

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Surgery

A neck midline incision was made, and the soft tissues were
pulled apart to expose the vessels. The right (CCA) and the right
external carotid artery (ECA) were dissected and ligated using

4-0 suture (Jinhuan Medical Products Co., Ltd., Shanghai,
China). Then the right internal carotid artery (ICA) was separated and occluded temporally by a microvascular clip. A silk
suture was loosely tied around the CCA close to the clip, which
would be fastened to secure the inserted suture after the occlusion was made. A 4-0 endovascular suture with 5-mm silicone
coating length (Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) was
advanced via the incision into the right CCA toward the right
ICA. The clip was then released and then the suture was
advanced up to a premarked insertion depth.5,18 In the LSCI
guided group, the suture insertion was adjusted to meet the criteria of CBF changes (see Sec. 2.6). After the MCAO, the
remaining suture was cut and the neck incision was closed.
Laser speckle images were continuously recorded starting from
the beginning of the surgery up to 30 min after the occlusion
(Fig. 1).

2.4

Infract Volume Calculation

Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the rats were euthanized and
the brains were isolated and sectioned coronally into five slices
(thickness: 3 mm) with brain matrices (Model No. 68710, RWD
Life Science Co., Ltd,). All brain slices were stained with 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC,
St. Louis, Missouri) at 37°C for 10 min in a dark chamber.
The infarct volume was quantitated by ImageJ software (Ver.
1.44, National Institutes of Health).19 The infarct area for
each slice was measured by subtracting the non-ischemic
area of ipsilateral hemisphere from that of the contralateral
hemisphere. The infarct volume was calculated as the summation of all the slice infarct area multiplied by the slice thickness.

2.5

Data Processing

We investigated the full-field intraoperative CBF variations during the MCAO model. Three regions of interest (ROIs) were
selected for quantitative CBF analysis, including the vein in
the right hemisphere (RV), the artery in the right hemisphere
(RA), and the capillary bed in the somatosensory area of the
right hemisphere (RC) [Fig. 1(b)]. In the CBF-guided MCAO
model, we used the ratio of the cortical area with more than
50% CBF (i.e., CBF50 ) drop as the criterion for its early prognostic value.12 At each recording time, the relative CBF50 reduction area (R50 ) is defined

Experiment Design

2.6.1

Experiment A

We monitored the CBF evolution while manipulating the suture
insertion depth during the standard MCAO surgery. Eight rats
were used in this experiment. During the surgery, the CBF was
recorded for the suture insertion starting from 1.4 up to 2.4 cm
with a step of 0.2 cm. The selection of this insertion range is
based on the rat vascular anatomical features. The corresponding CBF images for a representative rat were shown in Fig. 1(b).
2.6.2

Experiment B

We compared the conventional MCAO model and the CBFguided MCAO model. Twenty-six rats were randomly divided
into two groups. In the conventional MCAO group (N ¼ 16),
the suture was advanced up to 1.8 cm from the bifurcation of
right CCA, which followed the standard protocols used in most
previous literature. In the CBF-guided MCAO group (N ¼ 10),
the CBF50 reduction area was monitored continuously and the
insertion of the suture immediately ceased when R50 ¼ 50%
was reached. This criterion was set according to the correlation
information between the CBF50 reduction area and lesion volume obtained from Experiment A (see Sec. 3.1). Twenty-four
hours after the MCAO, infarct volume was calculated after
euthanizing the rats and removing the brains.

2.7

Statistics Analysis

Statistical comparison of CBF during the entire MCAO surgery
was carried out using a two-tailed t-test with SPSS (Ver. 21.0,
SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). All data are presented as the
mean  SD. Statistical significance was assumed when P < 0.05.

Results
Spatiotemporal Changes of Cerebral Blood
Flow with Varying Suture Insertion

CBF dropped from 61.7%  7.2% to 29.8%  2.8% in artery,
from 62.3%  5.1% to 35.4%  4.0% in vein, and from
62.9%  5.6% to 30.1%  2.9% in capillary bed, respectively.
CBF became stable when the insertion depth was over 1.8 cm.
Figure 2(b) shows the changes of R50 , which concordantly indicates a significant increase from 20.9%  6.4% to 69.1% 
9.9% while the suture insertion depth increased from 1.6 to
1.8 cm. Therefore, 1.6 to 1.8 cm is the critical range of suture
advancement in this MCAO surgery, which is consistent with
the fact that 1.8 cm has been recommended for suture insertion by conventional MCAO surgery protocols. It is noted in
Fig. 2(b) that R50 increased approximately from 30% to 70%
in the critical suture insertion range, we, therefore, used the
medium value (50%) as the criterion to guide the MCAO surgery in experiment B.

3.2

First, we investigated the spatiotemporal changes of CBF while
manipulating the suture insertion depth during MCAO surgery
in experiment A. Three ROIs representing vein, artery, and
capillary areas, respectively, were selected for analysis, as
shown in Fig. 1(b). In addition, the N pixel area was highlighted
and R50 was estimated when adjusting the insertion depth.
Figure 2(a) shows the average relative CBF in each ROI when
the suture insertion depth increased from 1.4 to 2.4 cm (N ¼ 8).
Overall, the relative CBF in all ROIs decreased when
advancing the suture into the vessel. It should be noted that
the CBF drop in vein was less than that in artery or capillary.
Apparently, the most significant CBF drop occurred when
suture was advanced from 1.6 to 1.8 cm, e.g., the relative

Image Guided Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Versus Conventional Middle Cerebral Artery
Occlusion Surgery

In the conventional MCAO group (N ¼ 16) without CBF guidance, two rats died within 24 h after the surgery. Therefore, we
further analyzed the data for the remaining 14 rats in this group.
When the suture was advanced up to 1.8 cm from the bifurcation
of the right CCA, we stopped the suture insertion and the corresponding R50 of each rat is shown in Fig. 3(b). Two rats were
found with no visible lesion in infract volume, and with R50
equal to about 0. The overall success rate of conventional
MCAO was 12∕16 ¼ 75%. The average infarct area in the conventional MCAO group was 0.417  0.217 cm3 (N ¼ 14). The
variance of infarct volume over mean value was 51.87%

Discussions

A stable rodent model of MCAO is of great importance in stroke
studies. Though the intraluminal MCAO model has been
the most common technique in experimental stroke studies,
high variance of infarct volume has limited its applications.
Excessive insertion of suture could increase the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage and thus bring higher mortality rates; while
insufficient insertion may not completely occlude the MCA
and thus likely lead to the failure of the model. Except for
the anatomic variance in animals, the success rate of the surgery
strongly depends on the skills of the technician. Compared with
the current “blind” surgery, the new CBF-guided MCAO model
offers a “closed-loop” surgical guidance for the technician and
thus improves the stability as well as the success rate.
Although there are other techniques, including magnetic
resonance angiography, positron emission tomography, MRI,
CT perfusion, that can be used to confirm the success of
MCAO,20,21 the poor temporal resolution hampers them from
application in intraoperative settings. Although LDF has been
widely used to monitor the CBF changes and confirm the success of MCAO during the surgery, it offers very limited prognostic information to guide the suture insertion due to its lack of
consistency.5,22 For example, the infarct volumes could vary a
lot even though LDF showed similar CBF reduction in
MCAO surgery.23,24
One limitation of the CBF-guided MCAO modeling is the
invasiveness introduced by creating the imaging window for
LSCI, though the cranial window still keeps the cerebral system
intact. It should be noted that noninvasiveness could be possible
for the CBF-guided MCAO model in mice, in which the skull
remains intact for LSCI.

[Fig. 3(a)]. In the CBF-guided MCAO group, we immediately
stopped the suture insertion as long as we observed that R50
increased to 50%. The insertion depths of different rats are
shown in Fig. 3(c). The stroke modeling was successful in all
rats (100%) and the infarct area was 0.477  0.134 cm3 , with a
ratio of variance over mean equal to 21.12% [Fig. 3(a)]. In addition, we performed F-test analysis (one-sided test) using
MATLAB® software for statistical comparison of variance
between the conventional and the CBF-guided groups. The
results showed that the conventional group had a significantly
greater variance than the CBF-guided group (51.87% versus
21.12%, P < 0.05). In Fig. 3(d), TTC-stained brain slices of representative rats from different groups in experiment B are
shown. Therefore, the CBF-guided surgery improved the infarct
volume consistency and success rate of stroke.

Conclusion

In this study, we confirmed the prognostic value of early CBF in
different types of vessels and demonstrated dynamic changes of
CBF during MCAO surgery when manipulating the suture insertion. We proposed the relative CBF50 (R50 ¼ 50% in this study)
as the criterion to guide the suture advancement to ensure a successful MCAO. Our experiments showed that the CBF-guided
MCAO significantly reduced the variance of stroke lesion and
increased the success rate of this model.
