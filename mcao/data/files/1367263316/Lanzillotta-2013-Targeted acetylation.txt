a b s t r a c t
Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) p50/RelA is a key molecule with a dual effect in the progression of ischemic
stroke. In harmful ischemia, but not in preconditioning insult, neurotoxic activation of p50/RelA is characterized by RelA-speciﬁc acetylation at Lys310 (K310) and deacetylation at other Lys residues. The derangement
of RelA acetylation is associated with activation of Bim promoter.
Objective: With the aim of producing neuroprotection by correcting altered acetylation of RelA in brain ischemia,
we combined the pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1–3, the enzymes known to reduce
global RelA acetylation, and the activation of sirtuin 1, endowed with a speciﬁc deacetylase activity on the K310
residue of RelA. To afford this aim, we tested the clinically used HDAC 1–3 inhibitor entinostat (MS-275) and the
sirtuin 1 activator resveratrol.
Methods: We used the mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and primary cortical
neurons exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD).
Results: The combined use of MS-275 and resveratrol, by restoring normal RelA acetylation, elicited a synergistic
neuroprotection in neurons exposed to OGD. This effect correlated with MS-275 capability to increase total RelA
acetylation and resveratrol capability to reduce RelA K310 acetylation through the activation of an AMPactivated protein kinase–sirtuin 1 pathway. The synergistic treatment reproduced the acetylation state of RelA
peculiar of preconditioning ischemia. Neurons exposed to the combined drugs totally recovered the optimal
histone H3 acetylation.
Neuroprotection was reproduced in mice subjected to MCAO and treated with MS-275 (20 μg/kg and 200 μg/kg)
or resveratrol (6800 μg/kg) individually. However, the administration of lowest doses of MS-275 (2 μg/kg) and
resveratrol (68 μg/kg) synergistically reduced infarct volume and neurological deﬁcits. Importantly, the treatment was effective even when administered 7 h after the stroke onset. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
of cortices harvested from treated mice showed that the RelA binding and histone acetylation increased at the
Bcl-xL promoter and decreased at the Bim promoter.
Conclusion: Our study reveals that epigenetic therapy shaping acetylation of both RelA and histones may be a
promising strategy to limit post-ischemic injury with an extended therapeutic window.

Although advances in neurobiology outline a new era for brain restoration, total recovery of function following a stroke remains a rare accomplishment (Lloyd-Jones et al., 2010). The only therapeutic agent
actually approved is the recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
(tPA) within 3 h of symptom onset; however, less than 5% of stroke patients can beneﬁt from the thrombolytic approach (Fang et al., 2010; Lees
et al., 2010). Thus, identifying molecular targets for interventions that
can be therapeutically implemented after stroke represents a compelling
task for research in neurology. The mechanisms of neurodegeneration
more involved in brain ischemia include excitotoxicity, calcium overload,

oxidative stress, acute inﬂammation and apoptosis (Bramlett and
Dietrich, 2004; Leker et al., 2002). Recently, defects in histone acetylation
homeostasis have been recognized as yet another common feature in
diverse neuropathological states including ischemic stroke (Hahnen et
al., 2008). Acetylation is the key post-translational modiﬁcation of
histones that controls the accessibility of chromatin to the transcriptional
machinery and plays an essential role in gene activation (Sweatt, 2009).
The acetylation of lysines is reversible and controlled by the opposing actions of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase
(HDAC). As over-deacetylation in brain ischemia is associated with a
global decrease in HAT activity (Jin et al., 2001; Rouaux et al., 2003),
HDAC inhibitors were evaluated and showed a therapeutic efﬁcacy in
mice models of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (Faraco et al.,
2006; Kim et al., 2007, 2009; Langley et al., 2008; Shein and Shohami,
2011). However, in the majority of studies conducted thus far, HDAC inhibitors were administered prior to or immediately following the onset
of MCAO, a therapeutic intervention that is not feasible when treating
stroke-inﬂicted individuals.
Besides histones, diverse non-histone proteins, including transcription
factors NF-κB, are modiﬁed by HATs and HDACs (Haberland et al., 2009).
Members of class I HDACs, particularly HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3, are
responsible for the general deacetylation of NF-κB/RelA at ﬁve lysine residues (K122, 123, 218, 221, and 310) (Ashburner et al., 2001; Chen and
Greene, 2004), while sirtuin 1, a class III HDAC activated by resveratrol,
selectively deacetylates RelA at K310 (Lanzillotta et al., 2010; Yeung et
al., 2004). Recent studies demonstrate that pro-apoptotic transcription induced by NF-κB p50/RelA in acute brain ischemia (Inta et al., 2006;
Sarnico et al., 2009) relies on the speciﬁc derangement of normal RelA
acetylation, i.e., the reduced level of total RelA acetylation despite an aberrant increase of K310 acetylation (Lanzillotta et al., 2010). Notably, protective ischemic preconditioning and harmful ischemia induced similar
levels of p50/RelA activation, but only the ischemic injury induced the
derangement of RelA acetylation.
With the goal of optimizing the RelA acetylation state and concomitantly increasing histone acetylation, we studied the association
of the speciﬁc class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat (MS-275) (Simonini
et al., 2006) with resveratrol (Baur and Sinclair, 2006). MS-275 is a
synthetic benzamide derivative that has been shown to inhibit HDAC
1–3 with excellent pharmacokinetic properties (Simonini et al., 2006).
MS-275 has demonstrated anti-tumor activity and is currently under
evaluation in phase II clinical trials for cancer therapy (Tan et al.,
2010). Resveratrol is a widely studied polyphenol endowed with antiaging, anti-carcinogenic, anti-inﬂammatory and anti-oxidant properties
(reviewed in Yu et al., 2012). It is also under clinical evaluation for the
treatment of cancer, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases and
cognitive dysfunction in old patients (Smoliga et al., 2011). Moreover,
resveratrol has shown beneﬁcial effects in various models of brain ischemia, by interacting with a range of pathways devoted to enhance
cellular stress resistance (Robb and Stuart, 2010) and mitigate the formation of free radical species and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis
(Agrawal et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011; Morris et al., 2011; Ren et al.,
2011). Resveratrol acts as a multi-functional drug through major activation of sirtuin 1 (Howitz et al., 2003) and stimulation of AMP-activated
kinase (AMPK), a serine–threonine kinase that acts as a key metabolic
balance and stress sensor/effector (Ruderman et al., 2010).
Our results demonstrate that the drug combination, by shaping RelA
and histone acetylation, elicits a synergistic neuroprotection and effectiveness, even when administered 7 h after the onset of ischemia.
Methods
Cell cultures
Primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Italia. Primary
cortical neurons were prepared from cortices of 15-day embryonic

mice and cultured as previously described (Sarnico et al., 2009).
Cells were plated at a density of 1.0 × 10 5 cells/cm2 in 2 cm 2 culture
dishes for the viability studies, in 21 cm 2 culture dishes for Western
blot and co-immunoprecipitation analyses and in 56 cm 2 culture
dishes (Nunc, Langenselbold, Germany) for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Experiments were carried out at 11 days in
vitro (DIV).
OGD
Oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) was performed in cortical neurons for 3 h as previously described (Sarnico et al., 2009). Control cell
cultures were incubated in a normal aerated incubator for the same
time period. At the end of the OGD period, cells were transferred to
recover in Neurobasal medium containing 0.4% B27 supplement
with or without MS-275 (0.1, 0.5 or 1 μM) and resveratrol (1, 3 or
30 μM) alone or in combination. The HDAC inhibitor MS-275 (Vinci
Biochem, Italy) and resveratrol (Merck Chemicals Limited, UK) were
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted before application to a ﬁnal DMSO concentration lower than 0.3%. When present,
the AMPK inhibitor, compound C (10 μM, Sigma Aldrich, Missouri,
USA), or the sirtuin 1 inhibitor, sirtinol (50 μM, Sigma Aldrich),
were co-administered with resveratrol and MS-275. The cell viability
was estimated 24 h later. Extraction of cell proteins or chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed 2 h after the OGD period.
Neuronal injuries were evaluated by measuring the amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the culture medium relative
to total releasable LDH, using the CytoTox 96 ® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega Corporation, Wisconsin, USA).
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was carried
out as previously described (Pignataro et al., 2008) in male C57BL/6
mice weighing 25 to 27 g (Charles River Italia). Anesthesia was induced with 5% isoﬂurane in a 70% nitrous oxide/30% oxygen mixture
and maintained with 2% isoﬂurane. The right carotid bifurcation was
exposed, and the external carotid artery was coagulated distal to
the bifurcation. A 5–0 nylon ﬁlament was inserted through the external carotid artery stump and advanced into the right internal carotid
artery until it blocked the origin of the MCA. After 60 min of MCAO,
animals were again anesthetized, and the ﬁlament was withdrawn
to restore blood ﬂow.
Cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) was monitored in the cerebral cortex
ipsilateral to the occluded MCA with a laser-Doppler ﬂowmeter
(Periﬂux system). Once a stable CBF signal was obtained, the MCA
was occluded. CBF was monitored throughout the 1 h occlusion period and the ﬁrst 30 min of reperfusion. Only those mice that reached
at least 70% of CBF reduction after the MCAO were included in the experimental groups (Pignataro et al., 2008).
Evaluation of ischemic volume and neurologic deﬁcit scores
Mice were decapitated 24 or 72 h after ischemia. Ischemic volume
was evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining (Bederson
et al., 1986). The brains were cut into 500 μm coronal slices with a
vibratome (Campden Instrument, 752 M). Sections were incubated in
2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride for 20 min and in 10% formalin
overnight. The infarcted area was calculated by image analysis software
(Image-Pro Plus) (Pignataro et al., 2008). The total infarct volume was
expressed as a percentage of the volume of the hemisphere ipsilateral
to the lesion.
In mice, 24 or 72 h after ischemia, neurological function was scored
according to two scales: a general neurological scale and a focal neurological scale, as described by Clark et al. (1997). In the general score, 6 general
deﬁcits were measured: (a) hair conditions (0–2), (b) position of ears
(0–2), (c) eye conditions (0–4), (d) posture (0–4), (e) spontaneous activity (0–4), and (f) epileptic behavior (0–12). For each of the six general parameters measured, animals received a score that correlated directly with

A. Lanzillotta et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 49 (2013) 177–189

the degree of symptom severity, as previously reported (Clark et al.,
1997). The scores of investigated items were then summed to provide a
total general score ranging from 0 to 28. For the focal score, 7 areas
were assessed: (a) body symmetry, (b) gait, (c) climbing, (d) circling
behavior, (e) front limb symmetry, (f) compulsory circling, and (g) whisker response. The severity of each of these items was rated on a scale from
0 to 4. The seven items were then summed to give a total focal score ranging between 0 and 28. The single item does not provide any signiﬁcant
information per se. A higher score correlated with the worst animal condition (Clark et al., 1997).
Ischemic volume, neurologic function, and animal survival were
evaluated in a blinded manner.
Experimental protocol
MS-275 and resveratrol were dissolved in saline and intraperitoneally
(ip) administered at 1, 3, 5 or 7 h after stroke onset. The doses used were
68, 680 and 6800 μg/kg for resveratrol and 2, 20 and 200 μg/kg for
MS-275. Control mice undergoing MCAO received saline in the
same volume and on the same time schedule as the MS-275 or
resveratrol-treated animals.
The doses used in vivo were chosen in the attempt to obtain in the
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF, 50 μl) pick concentrations similar to those
effective in vitro. By considering that only 2% of plasmatic resveratrol
can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) (Asensi et al., 2002), to obtain
a resveratrol concentration of 3 μM in the CSF, we injected a dose of
68 μg/kg as starting dose. Also, we approximated a total absorption
through the ip route of administration and a compensation of drug
metabolism by increased BBB permeability after brain ischemia.
Dosages of MS-275 were chosen in order to predict an initial CSF
concentration 30 fold lower than that of resveratrol.
We also administered the drugs at 10- and 100-fold higher doses.
Mice were sacriﬁced 24 or 72 h after the MCAO. Body temperature,
PaO2, PaCO2 and pH values were monitored for the entire experiment
both in control and drug-treated groups. Animals were randomly
assigned either to the saline or the compound treatment groups.
Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis
Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot studies of RelA and
histone acetylation were performed in nuclear extracts (Pizzi et al.,
2005) from mouse cortical neurons exposed to 3 h-OGD and then
reoxygenated for 2 h in the presence of MS-275 and resveratrol or
vehicle.
Twenty micrograms of nuclear extracts were diluted in RIPA buffer
(10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 140 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride,
1% protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with
2 μg/ml of goat anti-RelA antibody (sc-372G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
California, USA).
After incubation, 25 μl of protein A/G Plus-Agarose (sc-2003, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the reaction mixture and rotated
for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected, by centrifuging at
770 g for 5 min, and washed with the RIPA buffer, as recommended
by the protein A/G Plus-Agarose manufacturer. The procedure was repeated four times. After the ﬁnal wash, all proteins that adhered to
the protein A/G beads were detached by boiling the beads in the loading buffer. Samples were rapidly centrifuged to pellet the agarose
beads, and supernatants were analyzed by SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. Co-immunoprecipitated proteins were detected by
Western blotting using the following antibodies: rabbit anti-RelA
(1:1000, sc-372, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-acetyl-NF-κB
RelA (K310) (1:250, #3045, Cell Signaling Technology, Massachusetts,
USA) and rabbit anti-acetyl-K (1:500 #06-933 Upstate-Millipore,
Massachusetts, USA).
For Western blot analyses, nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins (25 μg
proteins/sample) were resolved by 4–12% SDS–polyacrylamide gels.
Immunodetection was performed by incubating the membrane overnight

179

at 4 °C, with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antiacetyl-H3 (K9/18) (1:500, #07-593 Upstate-Millipore), rabbit polyclonal
anti-histone H3 (1:1000, #9715 Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-AMPKα (Thr172) (1:800, #2535 Cell Signaling Technology) and rabbit polyclonal anti-AMPKα1/2 (1:1000, sc-25792, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology).
The immunoreaction was visualized by a 1 h incubation at 37 °C
with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000,
NA934, GE Healthcare, England, UK) and chemoluminescence detection
using ECL Western blotting reagents (RPN2132, GE Healthcare).
Quantiﬁcation of protein expression was performed by the densitometry analysis of the immunoblots using Gel Pro.3 analysis software
(MediaCybernetics, MD, USA).
HDAC analysis
Total HDAC activity was measured using the EpiQuik HDAC
Activity/Inhibition Assay Kit (Epigentek, New York, USA). In brief,
the nuclear extracts of mouse cortical neurons, exposed to 3 h of
OGD and subsequently treated with MS-275 and resveratrol for 2 h,
were incubated with a speciﬁc substrate for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by
incubation with capture antibodies for 60 min and detection antibodies
for 30 min at room temperature. Absorbance was determined using a
microplate spectrophotometer at 450 nm. HDAC activity was measured
according to the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were
performed in triplicate at least three times before calculating the
means and standard errors.
Reporter gene assays
For reporter gene fusion experiments we used: 1) the Bcl-xL promoter
luciferase and the Bcl-xL ΔκB luciferase, carrying a mutation of the κB site,
produced by Ron Hay (University of Dundee, UK) and kindly provided by
Dr. Perkins (University of Dundee, UK) (Rocha et al., 2003) and 2) the
Bim promoter luciferase and the Bim ΔκB luciferase, carrying a mutation
in the κB site (Inta et al., 2006). After 10 DIV cortical neurons were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, California,
USA) with 1 μg/ml of the Bim or Bcl-xL expression plasmids, as previously
described (Lanzillotta et al., 2010; Sarnico et al., 2009).
To investigate Bim promoter activity after drug treatments, cortical
neurons were transfected with 1 μg/ml of the Bim expression plasmid.
After 24 h, neurons were exposed to 3 h OGD and 4 h recovery in
Neurobasal medium containing 0.4% B27 supplement with MS-275
0.1 μM and resveratrol 3 μM, alone or in combination.
To normalize the transfection efﬁciency, 0.05 μg per well of a
Renilla luciferase (phRLTK) control plasmid (Promega Corporation)
was used, and ﬁreﬂy and Renilla luciferase activity were measured
using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega Corporation). All
experiments were performed in triplicate at least three times before
calculating the means and standard errors.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and real-time PCR analysis
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed to
study RelA interactions and H3 histone acetylation at the Bim and
Bcl-xL promoters in both neuronal cultures exposed to OGD and cortices of mice subjected to MCAO. We used a ChIP assay kit (#9003S, Cell
Signaling Technology) for both cell cultures and brain tissues. Primary
cultures of mouse cortical neurons, exposed to 3 h of OGD and then
treated with MS-275 at 0.1 μM and resveratrol at 3 μM for 2 h, were
cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C.
For in vivo experiments, mice were exposed to MCAO, treated with
the combination of MS-275 at 2 μg/kg and resveratrol at 68 μg/kg at
the beginning of reperfusion and sacriﬁced 3 h later. Frozen brain tissue
from the ipsilateral hemispheres of 3 animals per group were pulled to
obtain approximately 500 mg and chopped into small pieces. Minced
tissue was cross-linked with 1.5% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C.

For both chromatin preparations, a glycine solution was added for
5 min at room temperature to stop the reaction. Cells and tissues
were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated on ice for 10 min in a
lysis buffer supplemented with 100 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride
(PMSF), dithiothreitol (DTT), and a protease cocktail inhibitor mix.
Nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in a buffer supplemented with
DTT, digested by micrococcal nuclease, and homogenized on ice. After
centrifugation, the sheared chromatin was incubated with anti-acetyl
H3 (K9/18) (#07-593, Upstate-Millipore), anti-RelA (sc-372X, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-IgG (negative control) overnight at 4 °C.
Then, magnetic-coupled protein G beads were added and the chromatin
was incubated for 2 h in rotation. An aliquot of chromatin that was not
incubated with an antibody was used as the input control sample.
Antibody-bound protein/DNA complexes were washed, eluted, treated
with proteinase digest proteins, and subjected to real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses.
Immunoprecipitated DNA (4 μl) was ampliﬁed in a 25 μl reaction
mixture containing SYBR Green master mix (BIORAD, California, USA).
The primers used to amplify the mouse Bim promoter were as follows:
forward, 5-CTG GAT GCA GGT TGG GTA G-3; and reverse, 5-GGG AAT
GAG AAA GTT AGC TGG A-3, which generated a 410-bp product. The
primers used to amplify the Bcl-xL promoter were as follows: forward,
5-CTC AGC TCT CCA GCA CAC AC-3; and reverse, 5-ACA ACA TGG CCT
CAG GAA AA-3, which generated a 160-bp product. Incorporation of
the SYBR Green dye into the PCR products was monitored in real-time
with a BIORAD iCycler detection system, allowing the determination
of the threshold cycle (CT) at which the exponential ampliﬁcation of
PCR products began. Each reaction was performed in triplicate.
In ChIP experiments, CT values obtained by qRT-PCR analysis in
samples immunoprecipitated with anti-RelA or anti-acetyl-H3 antibody were normalized over corresponding CT values obtained by IgGimmunoprecipitation, and further normalized over relative CT values
obtained in INPUT (no antibody) chromatin. Final data obtained in
neurons exposed to OGD or OGD plus drugs were then normalized to
data obtained in control neurons, i.e., neurons maintained in normal
oxygen–glucose conditions. Data obtained in mice subjected to MCAO
or MCAO plus drugs were normalized to the data obtained in shamoperated mice. Bars represent the fold changes relative to control cells
in Figs. 1D and 4D, or to sham-operated mice in Fig. 7.

Statistics
Data obtained in cultured neurons were expressed as mean±standard error and statistical signiﬁcance of differences between groups was
evaluated by two-way ANOVA and Dunnet's multiple comparison test,
using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). pb 0.05
was considered to be signiﬁcant. Data from ChIP analyses were analyzed
using Student's t-tests for independent data. pb 0.05 was considered to be
signiﬁcant.
For the evaluation of the protective effect of MS-275 and resveratrol
in vivo, on the infarct volume, data were expressed as mean± standard
error and statistical analysis was performed by 2-way ANOVA followed
by Newman Keuls test.
Data relative to focal and general neurological deﬁcits, being ordinal
data, were analyzed using the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test,
followed by the Nemenyi test for the non-parametric multiple comparison. Statistical signiﬁcance was accepted at the 95% conﬁdence level
(p b 0.05).

Study approval
All animal experiments were authorized by the Italian Ministry of
Health and by the Animal Care and Use Committees at the University
of Brescia and the University of Naples “Federico II” in compliance
with the Italian guidelines for animal care and use (DL 116/92) and
the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC).

Results
Histone H3 and RelA acetylation levels in neurons following OGD
We investigated whether the histone H3 acetylation state was altered
in primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons exposed to 3 h of OGD.
This is an experimental condition leading to neuronal apoptosis within
a few hours and secondary plasma membrane breakdown (Sarnico et
al., 2009), evaluated through the measurement of LDH released in the
medium at 24 h. Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts prepared
after 2 h of reoxygenation revealed a signiﬁcant decrease in the ratio
between the histone H3 acetylation at the Lys9/18 (H3 Ac-K9/18) and
the total histone H3 (p=0.0421, F=3.16, Fig. 1A). We also evaluated
the acetylation state of the NF-κB RelA. RelA was immunoprecipitated
from nuclear extracts, and its acetylation was assessed using a speciﬁc
anti-acetyl-RelA(K310) antibody (RelA Ac-K310) and the general
anti-acetyl-K antibody that recognizes general lysine acetylation. As
previously described, co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed a global
RelA increase after OGD (p= 0.0054, F =19.73) (Lanzillotta et al., 2010;
Sarnico et al., 2009). In this condition acetylation at K310 of RelA
appeared increased (p =0.0463, F=7.01) despite a reduced level of
overall RelA acetylation (p =0.0072, F= 26.42) (Fig. 1B) (Lanzillotta et
al., 2010).
OGD-promoted RelA activation induces Bim and inhibits Bcl-xL promoters
We have previously shown that the exposure of cortical neurons to
OGD signiﬁcantly induces the expression of the pro-apoptotic Bim (Inta
et al., 2006) while reducing the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL gene
(Sarnico et al., 2009). We here studied the speciﬁc contribution of NF-κB
to the anoxia-induced pro-apoptotic program by investigating the
responsivity of the Bim and Bcl-xL promoters to OGD.
Primary cortical neurons were transfected with Bim or Bcl-xL
promoter-luciferase plasmids or with Bim and Bcl-xL ΔκB carrying a
mutation in the sequence of the NF-κB binding site. As previously
reported (Sarnico et al., 2009), the OGD exposure induced a twofold
increase in the activity of the Bim promoter (p = 0.0287, F = 12.33).
No modiﬁcation was induced in the Bim ΔκB plasmid activity, demonstrating that changes in the Bim transcription were NF-κB-speciﬁc
(p = 0.93, F = 0.42). Conversely, the Bcl-xL promoter activity was partially reduced by OGD exposure (p = 0.0476, F = 16.21). The mutation
of the NF-κB binding site at the Bcl-xL promoter reduced the basal activity and the responsiveness to OGD (p = 0.0490, F = 8.47) (Fig. 1C).
We further analyzed the interactions between RelA and the Bim or
Bcl-xL promoters induced by OGD, through chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. The recruitment of RelA to Bim and Bcl-xL promoters
was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR) analyses using primers that ampliﬁed the sequence of the
Bim and Bcl-xL promoters, including the κB binding sites.
RelA binding to the Bim promoter increased while binding to
Bcl-xL promoter decreased. These ﬁndings suggest that, as a possible
consequence of OGD-induced derangement of RelA acetylation, RelA
shifts from the Bcl-xL to the Bim promoter (Fig. 1D).
Synergistic neuroprotection elicited by MS-275 and resveratrol in cortical
neurons exposed to OGD
In order to evaluate the neuroprotective activity of MS-275 and resveratrol, primary cortical neurons were exposed to OGD for 3 h, and
then treated with resveratrol at 1, 3 or 30 μM concentrations or with
MS-275 at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 or 1 μM. A previous evaluation of
drug toxicity showed no adverse effect on cell viability (Supplementary
Fig. 1A). In the OGD experimental setting, both compounds displayed
per se a signiﬁcant neuroprotective activity at the higher concentrations,
30 μM for resveratrol (p = 0.0428, F =15.24) and 0.5–1 μM for MS-275
(p = 0.0437, p = 0.0392, respectively; F = 6.12, F= 8.15, respectively).

No effect was observed at the lower concentrations of 3 μM for resveratrol (p = 0.93, F =2.04) and 0.1 μM for MS-275 (p = 0.81, F = 1.59).
However, when tested in association the subthreshold concentrations
of resveratrol and MS-275 maximally prevented the cell death (p =
0.0383, F = 17.42), suggesting that the two compounds can elicit a synergistic effect (Fig. 2).
Effect of MS-275 and resveratrol on histone H3 acetylation
To investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with synergistic neuroprotection elicited by resveratrol and MS-275, we investigated the capability of the two compounds to inhibit the HDAC
activity and restore the normal histone acetylation. A colorimetric
HDAC activity assay was used to evaluate the inhibition of class I
and II HDACs in mouse cortical neurons exposed to 3 h of OGD and
then treated with MS-275 and resveratrol during the subsequent
2 h of reoxygenation. The general HDAC activity was not signiﬁcantly
modiﬁed by OGD exposure (p = 0.35, F = 1.78). When applied in the
post-OGD period, MS-275 and resveratrol were able to reduce HDAC
function. The HDAC activity showed a trend to decrease in the presence of 0.1 μM MS-275 (p = 0.64, F = 1.16) and was markedly depressed by 1 μM MS-275 (p = 0.0067, 3.71), conﬁrming the HDAC
inhibitory activity of MS-275. A similar degree of HDAC inhibition
was produced by either 3 or 30 μM of resveratrol (p = 0.0042, p =
0.0199, respectively; F = 4.23, F = 11.98, respectively), in agreement
with the capability of resveratrol to inhibit the HDAC6 isoform

(Blackwell et al., 2008). Drugs used in combination at the lower concentrations showed an additive inhibitory effect on the general HDAC
activity (p = 0.0037, F = 3.69), suggesting that the drugs inhibit different HDAC isoforms (Blackwell et al., 2008) (Fig. 3A).
We then evaluated the pharmacological activity of MS-275 and
resveratrol in modulating the acetylation state of histone H3 in primary cortical neurons exposed to OGD. Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts showed that MS-275 at the neuroprotective 1 μM
concentration (p = 0.018, F = 10.66), but not at the 0.1 μM concentration (p = 0.08, F = 2.17) used in the synergistic combination, was able
to counteract H3 deacetylation on K9/18. No signiﬁcant effect of resveratrol on H3 acetylation was detected at both tested concentrations
3 μM (p = 0.77, F = 1.50) or 30 μM (p = 0.11, F = 1.44). Combining
the two drugs at the lower concentrations completely restored the
H3 acetylation (p = 0.042, F = 28.69), suggesting that the synergistic
neuroprotection was also associated with the capability of the drugs
to maintain adequate levels of histone H3 acetylation (Fig. 3B).
The increase in H3 acetylation in a cell maintained in normal oxygen–
glucose condition was evident by using MS-275 at the higher concentration, but not using a combination of MS-275 and resveratrol at low
concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 1B).
Resveratrol increases AMPK phosphorylation in the post-OGD period
We evaluated the capability of the two compounds to increase
the activity of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) by measuring AMPK

182

phosphorylation at the Thr172 (T172) residue, a known molecular
target of resveratrol (Ruderman et al., 2010). Immunoblot analysis
of cytoplasmic extracts showed that resveratrol at 30 μM is able to
increase AMPK phosphorylation, in basal conditions (p = 0.0459
and F = 24.92, Supplementary Fig. 1C). Furthermore, AMPK dephosphorylation produced by OGD (p b 0.0001, F = 21.02) was efﬁciently counteracted by resveratrol at either 3 μM or 30 μM concentration (p = 0.0315, p = 0.0044, respectively; F = 10.93, F = 12.82,
respectively). As shown in Fig. 3C, MS-275 neither increased the
AMPK phosphorylation (at 0.1 μM p = 0.90 and F = 1.87, at 1 μM
p = 0.13 and F = 1.02), nor reinforced the stimulatory effect produced by resveratrol at 3 μM (p = 0.0330 and F = 57.46). It suggests
that while resveratrol at the lower concentration is able to activate
the AMPK function, no synergy with MS-275 occurs at the level of
AMPK (p = 0.26 and F = 2.25 resveratrol 3 μM versus MS-275–
resveratrol combination).

The combination of MS-275 and resveratrol prevents the derangement
of RelA acetylation and reduces both histone H3 acetylation and RelA
recruitment at the Bim promoter
We evaluated the capability of MS-275 and resveratrol alone and in
combination to revert the derangement of RelA acetylation, i.e., the general deacetylation of RelA and the speciﬁc acetylation of K310 residue,
following OGD.
Treatment in the post-OGD period with MS-275 at 0.1 μM or 1 μM
per se did not reduce the acetylation of RelA at the K310 residue (p =
0.41, p = 0.39, respectively; F = 1.65, F = 2.01, respectively), but significantly increased the global RelA acetylation (p = 0.0456, p = 0.0020,
respectively; F= 6.99, F =12.84, respectively). Conversely, resveratrol
either at 3 μM or 30 μM did not increase the total RelA acetylation
(p = 0.34, p = 0.06, respectively; F = 2.48, F = 1.12, respectively) but,
in line with previous data (Lanzillotta et al., 2010), it reduced the
K310 acetylation (p = 0.0015 and F = 19.89) at the higher concentration. When used together, 0.1 μM MS-275 and 3 μM resveratrol efﬁciently reverted the unbalanced RelA acetylation produced by OGD by
increasing the general RelA acetylation (p =0.0073 and F = 16.95)
and by speciﬁcally deacetylating the K310 residue (p b 0.0001 and F =
59.77) (Fig. 4A).

Our previous ﬁndings showed that OGD-induced Bim promoter
and cell death can be signiﬁcantly enhanced by RelA overexpression.
Bim promoter activation and neurotoxicity dramatically decreased in
cells overexpressing the acetylation resistant RelA-K310R mutant
(Lanzillotta et al., 2010), indicating that NF-κB-mediated events are
completely dependent on K310 acetylation of RelA. To investigate
the response of the Bim promoter to the drug administration after
OGD exposure, we performed experiments using reporter fusion
genes. Mouse cortical neurons transfected with Bim promoter luciferase plasmid were treated with MS-275 (0.1 μM) and resveratrol
(3 μM) individually or in combination. The OGD-induced activation
of the Bim promoter was not modiﬁed by MS-275 (p = 0.82 and F =
1.55) and was only slightly decreased by resveratrol alone (p = 0.24
and F = 2.13), while it was signiﬁcantly suppressed by the drug combination (p = 0.0007 and F = 10.71) (Fig. 4B).
We also performed ChIP assays to evaluate the acetylation of H3
histone and RelA binding at the Bim promoter. When compared to vehicle treatment, the drug exposure after OGD led to a strong decrease
in the RelA binding and endogenous H3 acetylation at the promoter
(p = 0.0404, p = 0.0020, respectively; F = 4.55, F = 30.97, respectively) (Fig. 4C). These ﬁndings suggest that the synergistic effect elicited
by MS-275 and resveratrol is preceded by a modiﬁcation of RelA acetylation that causes the detachment of the NF-κB transcription factor
from the Bim promoter and inhibits the pro-apoptotic Bim expression.
To explore a possible role of the AMPK–sirtuin 1 pathway activation
in neuroprotection, we tested an MS-275 and resveratrol combination
in the presence of compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, or sirtinol, a sirtuin
1 inhibitor. Both AMPK and sirtuin 1 inhibition completely blocked the
neuroprotective effect of the MS-275 and resveratrol combination (p =
0.46 and F= 1.36 for compound C; p = 0.98 and F = 1.18 for sirtinol)
(Fig. 4D), suggesting that AMPK–sirtuin 1 pathway is deeply involved
in synergistic neuroprotection.
The MS-275 and resveratrol combination reduces MCAO-induced brain
damage and ameliorates focal and general scores
For the mouse ischemia model, the right middle cerebral artery was
occluded for 60 min, followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Treatments were
administered ip at the beginning of reperfusion period. To determine
the synergistic protective effect of the association between MS-275

period after the OGD, show per se a signiﬁcant neuroprotective activity. The combination of ineffective resveratrol (3 μM) and MS-275 (0.1 μM) lead to maximal neuroprotection.
Values are expressed as a percentage of neurotoxicity, measured by an LDH assay. Bars depict the mean ± s.e.m. from three separate experiments run in triplicate. *pb 0.05 versus the

and resveratrol, the two compounds were injected individually at increasing doses (resveratrol, 68, 680, 6800 μg/kg; MS-275, 2, 20 and
200 μg/kg), or in combination (resveratrol 68 μg/kg+ MS-275 2 μg/kg
and resveratrol 680 μg/kg+ MS-275 20 μg/kg). Administration of
2 μg/kg MS-275 (n=5, infarct volume = 58.5 ±0.9%), 68 μg/kg resveratrol (n= 7, infarct volume= 58.4 ± 4.2%) and 680 μg/kg resveratrol
(n= 6, infarct volume = 53.1 ± 3.6%) alone did not induce a signiﬁcant
difference in the infarct volume (p = 0.54, p = 0.61, p =0.16, respectively; F = 0.40, F = 0.27, F = 2.38, respectively), while 6800 μg/kg resveratrol (n= 5, infarct volume =35.8 ±5.8%), 20 μg/kg MS-275 (n=
5, infarct volume= 48.2 ± 3.6%) and 200 μg/kg MS-275 (n= 5, infarct
volume = 33.1 ± 6.8%) were able to produce a signiﬁcant reduction in
the infarct volume (p = 0.004, p = 0.047, p = 0.004, respectively; F =
13.34, F = 5.51, F =14.25, respectively) compared with the vehicle
treated group (n= 6, infarct volume= 61.2 ± 3.8%). Though, a maximal
30% protection was produced by the highest doses for both drugs.
Remarkably, a more consistent reduction in the infarct volume was
observed when ischemic mice were treated with the combination of

the two compounds at the lowest doses, 68 μg/kg resveratrol plus
2 μg/kg MS-275 (n =7, infarct volume=14.8±1.1%). The synergistic effect did not improve when a combination of 10-fold higher dose for both
drugs was used, i.e., 680 μg/kg resveratrol plus 20 μg/kg MS-275 (n=5,
infarct volume=27.8±5.7%) (p=0.0001 and p=0.0001, respectively;
F=158.4 and F=24.54, respectively) (Fig. 5A).
The general (Fig. 5B) and focal score (Fig. 5C) evaluations conﬁrmed the protective activity of the drug combination, though some
ameliorations were also detected for separate treatments. Not any
of the tested treatments induced a change in neurobehavioral scores
in the sham-operated animals (data not shown).
The numbers of animals excluded, because they died during the
surgery procedures or because the reduction in the CBF was less
than 70%, were respectively: vehicle-treated group, 3; 68 μg/kg resveratrol, 1; 680 μg/kg resveratrol, 1; 6800 μg/kg resveratrol, 0; 2 μg/kg
MS-275, 1; 20 μg/kg MS-275, 0; 200 μg/kg MS-275: 1; 68 μg/kg

reduces RelA acetylation at K310 residue. The combination of the drugs restores total RelA acetylation and decreases site-speciﬁcally the RelA K310 acetylation. Densitometry

To verify whether the protection was persistent for more than
24 h, another set of experiments was performed, and animals were
sacriﬁced 72 h after stroke onset. Interestingly, the combination of
the singularly ineffective dosages of resveratrol and MS-275 was
able to induce a signiﬁcant reduction (p=0.0001 and F=393.73) in
the infarct volume (n=7, infarct volume=16.2±1.2%) compared to
vehicle-treated animals (n=6, infarct volume=58.4±1.8%), 2 μg/kg
MS-275-treated animals (n =5, infarct volume=46.1±4.6%, p=0.089
and F=3.62) and 68 μg/kg resveratrol-treated animals (n=5, infarct
volume=50.6±2.0%, p=0.19 and F=2.00) (Supplementary Fig. 2A).
These data were accompanied by an amelioration in the general (Supplementary Fig. 2B) and focal neurological scores (Supplementary Fig. 2C).
The numbers of animals excluded, because they died during the surgery
procedures or because the reduction in the CBF was less than 70% were
as follows: vehicle-treated group, 3; resveratrol (68 μg/kg), 1; MS-275
(2 μg/kg), 1; resveratrol (68 μg/kg)+MS-275 (2 μg/kg), 1.
To detect a possible effect of MS-275 or resveratrol on other physiological parameters, PaO2, PaCO2, pH and body temperature were monitored in all animal groups. The two compounds did not affect any
parameter at any tested dosage (data not shown). Furthermore, MS-275
and resveratrol did not modify cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF), as measured

for 3 h by laser Doppler and compared with vehicle-injected animals
(data not shown).

The MS-275–resveratrol combination is effective in ameliorating the
consequences of an ischemic stroke in mice when it is administered up
to 7 h after ischemia onset
To determine the time window for the effectiveness of the combined MS-275 and resveratrol in treating brain ischemia, the two
compounds were ip administered to ischemic mice at 1, 3, 5 and 7 h
after MCAO. The percentage of the ipsilateral hemisphere infarct in
the vehicle-treated animals was 61.2 ± 3.8. However, administration
of the MS-275 and resveratrol combination (2 μg/kg and 68 μg/kg respectively) at 1 h (n = 7), 3 h (n = 6) or 5 h (n = 7) after the MCAO
signiﬁcantly reduced the percentage of the infarct respectively to
14.7 ± 1.1, 30.0 ± 6.8, 29.6 ± 5.9 (p = 0.0001, p = 0.002 and p =
0.001, respectively; F = 158.4, F = 16.04, F = 18.72, respectively)
(Fig. 6A) and the neurological deﬁcits (Figs. 6B and C). Treatment
starting at 7 h still displayed a minor, but signiﬁcant neuroprotection
(n = 5, infarct volume = 44.8 ± 6.4%; p = 0.049, F = 5.20).

A. Lanzillotta et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 49 (2013) 177–189

The numbers of animals excluded, because they died during the surgery procedures or because the reduction in the CBF was less than 70%,
were the following: vehicle-treated group, 3; drug combination administered 3 h after MCAO, 2; drug combination administered 5 h after
MCAO, 1; drug combination administered 7 h after MCAO, 1.
MS-275 and resveratrol administration after MCAO drives RelA recruitment and H3 acetylation from the Bim to the Bcl-xL promoter
We previously demonstrated that derangement of RelA acetylation found in cortical neurons exposed to OGD is also present in cerebral cortices of mice exposed to a transient MCAO and 4 h of
reperfusion (Lanzillotta et al., 2010). Here, we evaluated how the
state of the RelA acetylation could affect the RelA recruitment and
histone H3 acetylation at both the Bim and Bcl-xL promoters in vivo.
After 1-h MCAO, reperfused mice were intraperitoneally injected
with the drug combination (MS-275 2 μg/kg and resveratrol
68 μg/kg) or with vehicle. Three hours later, mice were sacriﬁced

185

and the ischemic cortices were processed for ChIP analysis. When
compared to the vehicle condition, the templates of treated mice
displayed a strong reduction of RelA binding and H3 acetylation
at the Bim promoter (p = 0.0140 and p = 0.0022 respectively)
(Figs. 7A and B). Conversely both RelA binding and H3 acetylation
increased at the Bcl-xL promoter in treated mice (p = 0.0174 and
p = 0.0277 respectively) (Figs. 7C and D). These results suggest
that in pathological conditions, the acetylation state of RelA drives
the transcriptional activity of NF-κB towards pro-apoptotic genes.
The binding of NF-κB to a gene promoter affects the acetylation
state of the promoter-associated histones to ﬁnalize the proper
gene transcription.
Discussion
The present study demonstrates that epigenetic drugs targeting
aberrant acetylation of NF-κB/RelA and histone proteins reduce postischemic brain injury with a wide therapeutic window.

In agreement with previous evidence (Lanzillotta et al., 2010; Sarnico
et al., 2009), we found that the activation of the p50/RelA dimer, responsible for pro-apoptotic transcription in the post-ischemic period (Inta et
al., 2006; Sarnico et al., 2009), displays a derangement of RelA acetylation, i.e., a reduction of RelA general acetylation and a speciﬁc increase
of RelA K310 acetylation. Activation of Bim promoter during OGD, as
well as the cell death, falls to basal levels in cells expressing the
acetylation-resistant RelA-K310R mutant (Lanzillotta et al., 2010),
suggesting that K310 acetylation of RelA is a key event driving proapoptotic activity of NF-κB. We now show that by undergoing these
changes, RelA detaches from the Bcl-xL promoter and binds the Bim promoter. The ischemic injury also reduces the H3 histone acetylation,
as previously shown (Faraco et al., 2006). Prompted by the ﬁndings
that deacetylation of RelA K310 by the sirtuin 1 activator resveratrol
(30 μM) increases neuronal resistance to OGD (Lanzillotta et al., 2010)
and inhibition of HDAC activity by restoring histone acetylation reduces
post-ischemic brain injuries (Faraco et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2007, 2009;
Langley et al., 2008), we investigated the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol in combination with MS-275, a class I HDAC inhibitor. We
show that post-ischemic administration of individual drugs, which are

already used in various clinical trials, decreases the infarct volume. Moreover, we demonstrate that MS-275 and resveratrol elicit a large synergistic effect when co-administered at sub-threshold doses.
Recent studies deﬁne histone acetylation as a master epigenetic
mechanism in the regulation of gene expression, and enhanced histone acetylation patterns could be referred to as a diagnostic signature of ongoing active gene expression events (Boutillier et al.,
2003; Gan et al., 2005; Lutz et al., 2000). In our cell-based model of
brain ischemia, histone H3 acetylation at the K9/18 residues was
drastically decreased, without evidence of a concomitant change in
HDAC activities. This phenomenon has been reported to be a consequence of energy depletion in ischemic conditions leading to the cellular reduction of pyruvate dehydrogenase activity and decreased
generation of acetyl-CoA. While a reduced availability of acetyl-CoA,
the fundamental co-factor for HAT activity, can underlay the decreased
levels of histone acetylation within the ischemic brain (Calvani and
Arrigoni-Martelli, 1999; Martin et al., 2005), the pharmacological inhibition of HDACs during brain ischemia has been found to limit reduction
of histone acetylation due to the decreased HAT activity (Faraco et al.,
2006).
In neurons exposed to OGD, the deacetylation of total H3 histones
highly correlated with both H3 deacetylation and RelA detachment
occurring at the Bcl-xL promoter, but not with H3 acetylation and RelA
recruitment at the Bim promoter. This may suggest that NF-κB binding
at the target promoter is the event guiding the promoter-speciﬁc histone acetylation.
In regards to the possible mechanisms involved in the synergistic
neuroprotection, we found that only at the higher, 1 μM concentration,

A. Lanzillotta et al. / Neurobiology of Disease 49 (2013) 177–189

MS-275 per se inhibited the HDAC activity and increased histone H3
acetylation. At 0.1 μM, MS-275 produced a lower HDAC inhibition, insufﬁcient in increasing histone acetylation. As previously described,
MS-275 provides selectivity for HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 (Khan et
al., 2008), with higher potency for HDAC1 (IC50 of ~0.2 μM), which
display as a common target the entire H3 histone (Johnson et al.,
2002). A decrease in general HDAC activity was also observed after application of either 3 or 30 μM resveratrol, possibly because resveratrol
can inhibit the HDAC6 isoform (Blackwell et al., 2008). Though, as H3
is not a target for the HDAC6 (Johnson et al., 2002), resveratrol did
not modify per se the H3 acetylation, but produced a synergistic effect
when associated with MS-275. To investigate metabolic changes possibly responsible for synergistic H3 acetylation, we evaluated the activity
of the AMPK, a resveratrol target regulating the metabolic balance
(Culmsee et al., 2001; Hawley et al., 2005; Turnley et al., 1999).
While MS-275 appeared to be ineffective, resveratrol, even at the
lower concentration, was able to induce AMPK phosphorylation at
the T172 residue after OGD. AMPK function is recognized to activate
many catabolic pathways that produce ATP and induce NARP to generate
NAD+. It can be hypothesized that the metabolic improvement induced
by resveratrol, via increased generation of acetyl-CoA in neuronal cells
(Turnley et al., 1999), can sustain HAT activity, thus contributing to the
observed recovery of H3 acetylation when co-administered with a low
concentration of MS-275. Moreover, by providing NAD +, the fundamental co-factor for class III HDACs, AMPK has been found to indirectly corroborate sirtuin 1 activation by resveratrol (Ruderman et al., 2010)
(Fig. 8).
Sirtuin 1 interacts with several proteins that are involved in key
cellular processes, including mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy
and stress-induced responses. The biological effects of sirtuin 1 are
mediated by its capability to deacetylate a wide range of transcriptional factors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c
coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1α), p53, NF-κB and FOXO proteins and

187

consequently regulate their activities (Wang et al., 2011). Our investigation does not rule out that other known targets of resveratrol/sirtuin 1
besides RelA acetylation may be involved in the pro-survival effect of the
drug. Certainly, activation of the AMPK–sirtuin 1 pathway played an
important role in the synergy of MS-275 and resveratrol. Either AMPK
inhibition by compound C or sirtuin 1 inhibition by sirtinol completely
abolished the neuroprotection induced by combined drugs in neurons
exposed to OGD.
We evaluated the capability of MS-275 and resveratrol, used independently and in combination, to modulate RelA acetylation in neurons exposed to OGD. MS-275 at 0.1 μM concentration, ineffective in
restoring H3 acetylation, signiﬁcantly increased the total RelA acetylation, suggesting that RelA is the primary target for HDACs, possibly
HDAC1 (Khan et al., 2008), inhibited by MS-275. Resveratrol at 3 μM
did not affect per se the RelA acetylation but, when co-administered
with MS-275, it caused deacetylation of RelA K310, a recognized target of sirtuin 1-deacetylase activity (Lanzillotta et al., 2010; Yeung et
al., 2004). As a result of the MS-275 and resveratrol combination, the
RelA general acetylation increased while the K310 acetylation
decreased (Fig. 8). This global change in the status of RelA acetylation
was not reproduced by the individual drugs, even when used at higher
concentrations. These ﬁndings suggest that resveratrol-activated sirtuin
1 may display a higher afﬁnity for RelA K310 when RelA is globally
hyper-acetylated by MS-275. The exact mechanism responsible for increased afﬁnity of sirtuin 1 to highly acetylated RelA remains to be
elucidated.
The neuroprotection and anti-apoptotic transcription appeared to be
closely related to the capability of the drug combination to restore the
optimal RelA acetylation, thus reproducing pharmacologically what occurs in preconditioning ischemia (Lanzillotta et al., 2010; Raval et al.,
2006). ChIP analysis revealed a strong decrease in RelA binding and H3
acetylation at the Bim promoter of neurons treated with MS-275 and
resveratrol after the OGD. It suggests that the detachment of RelA

Fig. 8. A proposed strategy to reduce post-ischemic brain injury by epigenetic drugs shaping RelA and histone acetylation. Resveratrol activates AMPK pathway, leading to increased AcCoA
levels and histone acetyl-transferase (HAT) activity. Furthermore, AMPK increases cellular NAD+ levels, thus enhancing sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activation by resveratrol. It corroborates to the
beneﬁcial deacetylation of RelA at lysine 310 (K310). MS-275, by blocking histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, enhances HAT-mediated acetylation of both RelA and H3 histone. The
combined pharmacological intervention reverts the unbalanced RelA acetylation occurring during ischemic insult. RelA detaches from the Bim promoter, where H3 histone undergoes
deacetylation, to repress pro-apoptotic Bim expression. Conversely, RelA binds the Bcl-xL promoter and drives histone H3 acetylation to induce anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL expression.

188

from its κB-binding site may reduce both HAT recruitment at the
transcriptional complex and acetylation of promoter associated-H3
histone.
Interestingly, the protective and transcriptional effects produced
by resveratrol and MS-275 in cortical neurons exposed to OGD were
entirely reproduced in the mouse MCAO model. The combination of
the drugs, at inactive doses per se, elicited a synergistic effect that
led to a higher reduction of brain damage than that produced by individual drugs at 100-fold higher doses.
Pharmacokinetics studies reported short half-life for both drugs,
approximately 15 min for resveratrol (Asensi et al., 2002) and 1 h
for MS-275 (Ryan et al., 2005). Thus, the in vivo efﬁcacy of such low
doses highlights the still underestimated capability of resveratrol
and MS-275 to reach injured brain and activate high-afﬁnity mechanisms which can cooperate to afford neuroprotection. In this context,
using 10-fold higher doses of drugs in combination did not improve
the ﬁnal beneﬁcial effects. In mice subjected to MCAO, drugs administered in the reperfusion period signiﬁcantly reduced cerebral infarct
volume and limited the subsequent neuronal deﬁcits. The treatment
had a long-lasting efﬁcacy as the beneﬁcial effects were still evident
72 h after the injury. Furthermore, the treatment was efﬁcacious
even when administered 7 h after the ischemic onset.
Neuroprotection was associated with the capability of the drug combination to ﬁnally switch transcription from pro- to anti-apoptotic
genes, as RelA binding shifted from the Bim to the Bcl-xL promoter.
Consequently, the acetylation of H3 histone associated with the Bim
promoter decreased, while the H3 acetylation at the Bcl-xL promoter
increased (Fig. 8). These ﬁndings provide clear evidence that a pharmacological intervention affecting the epigenetic machinery regulating
gene transcription can reduce post-ischemic brain damage.
Conclusions
The current ﬁndings show that aberrant RelA acetylation and histone deacetylation are both targeted by synergistic low doses of
MS-275 and resveratrol after brain ischemia. The treatment is effective even after a delayed administration of 7 h. This allows for a
great timeframe for action to restore brain damages. The immediate
hospitalization of patients with a cerebral ischemia is considered essential for the implementation of a therapy that can avoid the aggravation of symptoms and ameliorate the sequelae of stroke itself. The
current evidence that neuroprotection and the reduction of neurological deﬁcits are still achieved when the treatment is performed 7 h
after the stroke onset place the efﬁcacy of this strategy even beyond
the time window for thrombolysis, suggesting that it may either implement or replace the use of tPA.
The preclinical results of the present study may be crucial to determine the translational implications in the intensive care of cerebral
ischemia.
