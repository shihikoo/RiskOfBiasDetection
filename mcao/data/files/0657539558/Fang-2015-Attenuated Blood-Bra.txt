Abstract Following ischemic stroke, blood-brain barrier
(BBB) is disrupted and is further aggravated with the corresponding incidence of hyperlipidemia. BBB breakdown
promotes inflammation infiltration into the brain, which
exacerbates cerebral ischemic injury as a result. Here, we
report that 10-O-(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl)-ginkgolide B
methanesulfonate (XQ-1H), a novel analog of ginkgolide B,
alleviates BBB breakdown in hyperlipidemic rats and protects
endothelial cells against inflammatory response. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) modeled ischemic stroke in
rats. Before surgery, these rats were fed a cholesterol-rich diet
to induce an experimental hyperlipidemic condition. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) incubation with rat brain
microvessel endothelial cells (rBMECs) was applied to mimic
hyperlipidemia-induced inflammatory injury of BBB. The
results indicated more severe infarct size, increased BBB
permeability, excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and exaggerated inflammation infiltration of the brain
in hyperlipidemic rats following MCAO when compared to
rats fed with normal diet. XQ-1H protected BBB integrity,
lessoned brain edema and inflammation penetration, downregulated MMP-9 and VCMA-1 expressions, and extenuated

ischemic infarction. XQ-1H alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory response in rBMECs, characterized by promoting cell
viability, inhibiting TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 releasing, and
downregulating NF-κB inflammatory signal and downstream proteins, such as VCAM-1 and iNOS. In conclusion, the present study shows that XQ-1H stabilizes BBB
function following ischemic stroke in hyperlipidemic rats,
and the possible mechanisms may be related to inflammation inhibition.

Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and severe
disability in the world [1]. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is
a gatekeeper and modulator for the central nervous system
(CNS), which is disrupted during ischemic stroke and subsequent reperfusion (I/R) [2]. BBB hyperpermeability contributes to vasogenic edema, which is characterized by the fluid
movement from vascular to extravascular spaces [3]. This
vasogenic edema further reduces blood supply of neurons,
which then becomes a vicious cycle, accelerating brain damage. BBB hyperpermeability not only favors the formation of
vasogenic cerebral edema but also promotes infiltration of
circulating leukocytes which exaggerate BBB breakdown
and cerebral inflammation [4]. Therefore, extensive BBB
dysfunction and cerebral edema will further promote ischemic
injury.
It is not surprising that strategies that “repair” the BBB in
order to restore normal brain homeostasis, or prevent inflammatory infiltration, will be beneficial for ischemic stroke
prevention [5]. Therefore, several pharmacological compounds that can stabilize BBB integrity or promote neuronal
survival have been successful in animal studies [6]. Nevertheless, few agents could effectively treat ischemic stroke under
clinical conditions. A main probable reason is that young
animals without risk factors are mostly evaluated in animal
research studies [7]. Therefore, these studies hardly mimic the
clinical pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, such as observed
in patients with cerebral or cerebrovascular risk factors [8].
Hyperlipidemia, or hypercholesterolemia, is one of the
most important risk factors for ischemic stroke [9]; even
high-fat diet in the absence of dyslipidemia could negatively
affect neurovascular coupling and cerebrovascular function
[10]. The inflammatory response induced by hyperlipidemia
appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of
ischemic stroke and other forms of brain injury [11–13]. It is
also reported that loss of apolipoprotein E function with
hyperlipidemia results in BBB breakdown [14].

methanesulfonate (XQ-1H, Fig. 1), a novel analog of
ginkgolide B, exhibited anti-ischemia and BBB protection
properties as we reported previously [15–18]. Up to now, the
effect of XQ-1H on BBB integrity following ischemic stroke
in hyperlipidemic rats was still unknown. Hyperlipidemia
induced by excess or cholesterol-rich diet is a highly prevalent
condition in ischemic stroke patients, evidenced by about 45–
60 % of patients who exhibit elevated serum cholesterol levels

[19]. In the current study, middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) in the rats fed with cholesterol-rich diet was used to
mimic the coexistence of experimental hyperlipidemia and
ischemic stroke. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [20] stimulated
rat brain microvessel endothelial cells (rBMECs) served as
the in vitro BBB inflammatory model. We investigated the
effect of XQ-1H on BBB function and inflammatory response
in hyperlipidemic rats following ischemic stroke and in LPSincubated rBMECs, and illuminated the anti-inflammation
property of XQ-1H on stabilizing BBB.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
XQ-1H was kindly provided by Jiangsu Kefeiping Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Simvastatin was a product of
Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. TTC, MTT, EB,
LPS, rhodamine 6G, and collagenase II were purchased from
Sigma. DMEM-F12 medium and newborn calf serum were
products of Gibco. ELISA kits for rat TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-pNF-κB p65, antiVCAM-1, anti-MMP-9, and anti-iNOS antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. β-Actin antibody
was a product of Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology. All
other reagents were of analytical grade and commercially
available.
Cell Culture
rBMECs were primarily cultured as the BBB model
in vitro and prepared from the brain of Sprague-Dawley
rats (5–8 days; Jiangsu Province Animal Center) according
to the method described previously [21]. Briefly after the
surface vessels and meninges were removed, the cortex
gray matter was minced and incubated at 37 °C for
20 min in D-Hanks containing 0.05 % trypsin. After
centrifugation, the samples were filtered using 150- and

164

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:162–175

75-μm nylon mesh. Microvessels were collected on the
75-μm nylon mesh and digested in D-Hanks containing
0.1 % collagenase II at 37 °C for 25 min. The
microvessels were finally collected by centrifugation and
then cultured in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with
20 % newborn calf serum at 37 °C in 5 % CO2. Approximately
10–14 days after primary culture, rBMECs could grow up to
monolayers and reach confluence.
Animals and Treatment
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (220–250 g) were provided by
Zhejiang Laboratory Animals Center (Zhejiang Academy of
Medical Science, Hangzhou, China) housed in a temperaturecontrolled environment (18–22 °C) and humidity (40–70 %)
with a 12-h light-dark cycle, and allowed free access to
food and water before the experiment. All efforts were
made to minimize animal suffering and reduce the number
of animals used, and all experiments were in compliance
with institutional guidelines of China Pharmaceutical University
(Nanjing, China).
Rats were fed with a standard (normal diet, n=16) or
cholesterol-rich diet (supplemented with 3 % cholesterol,
0.2 % methylthiouracilum, 10 % lard, and 0.5 % sodium
cholate). Plasma lipid levels were measured 4 weeks later,
and animals with hyperlipidemia were divided into different
groups to receive the cholesterol-rich diet and drug treatment
for another week as described in Table 1 (n=8). Simvastatin
(4 mg/kg) or different dose of XQ-1H (7.8, 15.6, and
31.2 mg/kg) was given through intragastric administration
once daily for 1 week. At the end of the 5 weeks of feeding,
the rats were subjected to MCAO for 2 h, followed by a 22-h
reperfusion to induce ischemic stroke except those in the sham
group.
Induction of Focal Cerebral Ischemia
MCAO and reperfusion were conducted at the end of drug
administration, leading to an in vivo ischemic stroke as described previously [22, 23]. In brief, the middle cerebral artery
was occluded using a silicone-coated nylon monofilament

(diameter about 0.38 mm) inserted via the external carotid
artery. Reperfusion was initiated by withdrawing the filament
after 2 h. The body temperature was maintained at 37 °C
during surgery using thermostatically regulated feedbackcontrolled devices, and the local cerebral blood flow (LCBF)
of the middle cerebral artery territory was measured using
laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) (MP150 starter system,
BIOPAC system, Inc., USA). We quantified the ischemic
tissue damage 24 h following MCAO, which was also 22 h
after reperfusion.
Determination of Cholesterol and Triglyceride
At the end of the 5 weeks of feedings, blood samples were
obtained from the eyeballs of the rats. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels, two main indexes of blood lipid, were determined
by ultraviolet spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 500 nm
using commercially available kits.
Measurement of Infarct Size
The animals were sacrificed under deep anesthesia, and the
brains were quickly removed and coronally sectioned into 2mm-thick slices (from rostral to caudal). The brain slices were
incubated for 15 min in a 2 % TTC solution at 37 °C. Each
TTC-stained brain portion was then photographed with a
digital camera (Olympus C-4000, Japan). The infarcted area
in each section was measured using ImageJ analysis software.
The relative infarct size measure was calculated with the
following equation: relative infarct size=(contralateral area−
ipsilateral non-infarct area)/contralateral area [24].
Assessing of BBB Permeability
Evans blue (EB) extravasation was measured to evaluate BBB
opening as previously described [25]. Two hours before sacrifice, EB (2 % in saline, 2 ml/kg) was injected to rats via the
vena caudalis. The rats were transcardially perfused with icecold saline through the left ventricle until colorless perfusion
fluid was obtained from the right atrium. After decapitation,
the brain was weighed and placed in formylamine solution for

24 h at 56 °C. Following homogenization and centrifugation,
the extracted dye was determined at 632 nm with a spectrometer. The tissue EB leakage rate=(right hemisphere OD/right
hemisphere weight)/(left hemisphere OD/left hemisphere
weight).
Measurement of Brain Edema
Brain water content (BWC) was analyzed to evaluate brain
edema. Brain hemispheres were superficially dried, transferred into aluminum foil, weighed (“wet weight”), and dried
overnight at 105 °C in a desiccating oven. The dried slices
were then weighed again (“dry weight”). The total BWC was
calculated according to the following formula: [(wet weight−
dry weight)/wet weight]×100 % [26].
Pathological Observation of Cerebral Microvessel
Endothelium
The rats’ brain tissues (2–3 mm) were immersed immediately
in fixative (3.0 % glutaraldehyde buffered in 0.1 M sodium
cacodylate, pH 7.2). Following 2–3 days of storage, the specimen were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
postfixed in cacodylate-buffered 1 % osmium tetroxide,
dehydrated in an ethanol series, and embedded in Polybed
812. Ultra-thin (90 nm) sections were made, and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were carried out with
electron microscope JEM-2000EX, Japan [27].
Evaluation of Leukocyte Infiltration
Rhodamine 6G, a fluorescent dye which achieves 99.99 %
staining of leukocytes 5 min after intravenous infusion was
used in this study [28]. Fifty microliters of rhodamine 6G
(0.5 %) was intravenously infused to rats 24 h following
MCAO. Fifteen minutes later, the rats were sacrificed and
their brains were quickly removed onto ice. Carestream
in vivo imaging system was used to determine fluorescence
intensity at an excitation wavelength of 525 nm and an emission wavelength of 555 nm [29]. The whole brain mean
intensity (R/L)=right hemisphere mean intensity/left hemisphere mean intensity. Data was analyzed with Kodak Molecular Imaging Software 5.X.
Assay of Inflammatory Cytokine in Brain Tissue Homogenate
The ischemic brain hemisphere of the rats were obtained and
homogenized in physiological saline (1:9 w/v), and the supernatant was stored until use at −20 °C. TNF-α and IL-1β were
assayed by ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The presence and concentration of the TNF-α and
IL-1β were determined by the intensity of the color measured

165

in the 96-well immunoplates, which coated the anti-TNF-α or
anti-IL-1β antibody at a wavelength of 450 nm.
Measurement of VCAM-1 and MMP-9 Expressions in Brain
Like stated before, the rats were sacrificed under deep anesthesia 24 h following MCAO. The brains were fixed by
cardiac ventricle perfusion with heparinized saline, then were
followed by perfusion with 4 % paraformaldehyde. The brain
was removed, stored in a fixative for 24 h, then immersed in
30 % sucrose solution in PBS for 24 h. Coronal sections were
cut on cryostat at 4 μm of thickness, and sections were
mounted onto coated slides and were prepared for immunohistochemistry. Then, the sections were washed and blocked
with normal goat serum for 30 min. After that, the sections
were incubated with rabbit anti rat VCAM-1 antibody and
rabbit anti rat MMP-9 antibody at 37 °C for 1 h, and
MaxVisionTM immunohistochemical assay kit was applied
to measurement [30]. For semiquantitative measurements of
VCAM-1 and MMP-9 densities, the slides were photographed
and measured using a computer-assisted image analyzing
system (MiniSee).
Assess of Inflammatory Cytokine After H/R Injury
in rBMECs
rBMECs were preincubated with aspirin (3 μM) or XQ-1H
(10, 3, and 1 μM) for 24 h and washed twice with PBS.
After that, the cells were treated with sodium hydrosulfite
at a concentration of 30 mM in DMEM medium (low
glucose) for 2 h (hypoxia), and then cultured in the
DMEM-F12 medium for 2 h with no sodium hydrosulfite
(reoxygenation) [31]. At the end of incubation, the medium
was centrifuged, and NO and TNF-α released into the supernatant were detected. The NO production was determined by
measuring the concentration of nitrite from nitrates, a stable
metabolite of NO, with a modified Griess reaction method.
The nitrite concentrations were calculated with reference to a
standard curve constructed using sodium nitrite in sodium
phosphate buffer, at a wavelength of 550 nm. The presence
and concentration of the TNF-α was determined by ELISA kit
as mentioned above.
Evaluation of Cell Viability When rBMECs Exposed to LPS
rBMECs were treated with LPS at a concentration of 2 μg/ml
for 24 h at 37 °C. Meanwhile, cells were co-incubated with
aspirin (3 μM) or XQ-1H (10, 3, and 1 μM). After that, the
medium was replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium
containing 5 mg/ml MTT and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C.
Supernatant was removed, and cells were lysed with dimethyl
sulfoxide using a microtiter plate shaker for 15 min. The cell
viability was estimated according to the optical density (OD)

166

values determined by a microplate reader at an absorption
wavelength of 570 nm.

Determination of Inflammatory Cytokine Releasing
from rBMECs
After 2 μg/ml of LPS were incubated with rBMECs for 24 h,
the medium was centrifuged at 1,500g for 5 min, then the
supernatant was collected to determine IL-1β, IL-6, and
TNF-α using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s
instructions as mentioned above.

Analysis of VCAM-1, iNOS, Cytoplasmic NF-κB p65,
and Nuclear NF-κB p65 Expressions in rBMECs
Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins from cells were extracted by
Nuclear-Cytosol Extraction Kit (Applygen Technologies Inc.,
Beijing, China). Fifty micrograms of the protein were separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and polyvinylidene
fluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5 %
skim milk in 10 mM Tris-HCl containing 150 mM sodium
chloride and 0.5 % Tween 20 (TBS-T). After being washed
with TBS-T, the membranes were incubated with antiNF-κB p65, anti-VCAM-1, and anti-iNOS protein, respectively. Membranes were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h. The
bands were portrayed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents.

Statistics
Values were expressed as mean±standard error of the mean
(SEM). Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS software,
and statistical significance was analyzed by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) test, followed by Dunnett’s post hoc
tests. Statistical significance was assumed for P<0.05.

XQ-1H Alleviated Ischemic Infarction After Ischemic Stroke
in Hyperlipidemic Rats
Infarct size is a main index to estimate ischemic injury. The
rats in the MCAO group fed with the standard diet showed a
prominent infarct size of 38.7±1.3 % when exposed to
ischemic stroke. The infarction was worsened in the hyperlipidemic group fed with cholesterol-rich diet, as infarct size
increased significantly to 43.5±1.4 %. Preadministration
with simvastatin (4 mg/kg) or XQ-1H (31.2 and 15.6 mg/kg)
significantly alleviated the cerebral infarct size to 34.0±1.0,
33.3±1.6, 38.1±1.1, and 40.0±1.2 %, respectively (P<0.01,
P<0.05) (Fig. 2).
XQ-1H Extenuated BBB Leakage After Ischemic Stroke
in Hyperlipidemic Rats
EB leakage is commonly used to evaluate BBB permeability.
Following MCAO, the EB content in the ischemic hemisphere
was greater than in the normal hemisphere for the rats fed with
standard diet. Moreover, for the rats fed the cholesterol-rich
diet (P<0.05), more evident EB leakage was observed, as
shown in Fig. 3. Pretreatment with simvastatin (4 mg/kg) or
XQ-1H (31.2 and 15.6 mg/kg) decreased BBB leakage by
limiting EB penetration (P<0.01, P<0.05).
XQ-1H Lessened Brain Edema After Ischemic Stroke
in Hyperlipidemic Rats
BWC was expressed by assessing brain edema. The BWC of
the rats in the sham group (fed with the standard diet) was
78.9±0.4 %, which increased to 81.5±0.6 % in the MCAO
group (fed with the standard diet). The high-cholesterol diet
tended to accelerate brain edema as shown in the increase of
BWC to 83.9±0.6 %. Pretreatment with simvastatin (4 mg/kg)
or XQ-1H (31.2 and 15.6 mg/kg) evidently decreased the
BWC to 79.4±0.5, 79.6±0.5, and 81.5±0.8 %, respectively
(P<0.01, P<0.05) (Fig. 4).

Results
XQ-1H Decreased Hyperlipidemia in Rats Induced
by Cholesterol-Rich Diet
The rats fed with cholesterol-rich diet for 5 weeks exhibited
obvious hyperlipidemia, evidenced by increased cholesterol
and triglyceride concentration in serum. Administration of
simvastatin (4 mg/kg) or XQ-1H (31.2 and 15.6 mg/kg)
evidently improved excessive cholesterol intake induced
dyslipidemia (Table 2).

To evaluate endothelial function, we used ultrastructural characterization of cerebral microvascular endothelium. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The MCAO group fed with the
standard diet showed an outer layer of endothelium which
consisted of swollen endothelial cells with severely vacuolated cytoplasms, whereas the sham group showed the normal
ultrastructural appearance of the endothelium. Compared to
these groups, the hyperlipidemic rats showed a more severe
destruction of the ultrastructural characterization of microvascular endothelium. In the hyperlipidemic group, the results
reflected extracellular and intracellular swelling detected

shown in Fig. 6, leukocyte infiltration significantly increased
in the ischemic hemisphere compared to the normal hemisphere following MCAO in rats fed with standard diet; this
result showed to be even more severe in hyperlipidemic rats
(P<0.01). Pretreatment with simvastatin (4 mg/kg) or XQ-1H
(31.2, 15.6 and 7.8 mg/kg) inhibited inflammatory infiltration
in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.01, P<0.05).
XQ-1H Reduced Inflammatory Cytokine Releases After
Ischemic Stroke in Hyperlipidemic Rats
As shown in Table 3, inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α
and IL-1β, were stimulated after MCAO to mediate the inflammatory reaction. The results indicate that TNF-α and IL1β concentrations in brain tissue were elevated remarkably in
hyperlipidemic rats (P<0.01) and could be lessened by pretreatment with simvastatin (4 mg/kg) or XQ-1H (31.2, 15.6
and 7.8 mg/kg) (P<0.01, P<0.05).
XQ-1H Suppressed MMP-9 and VCAM-1 Expressions After
Ischemic Stroke in Hyperlipidemic Rats
Immunohistochemical studies were carried out to examine
MMP-9 and VCAM-1 expressions. As shown in Fig. 7,
MMP-9 and VCAM-1 were expressed at low levels in brain
tissue and microvessel but significantly increased after ischemic stroke (P<0.01). Hyperlipidemia exaggerated MMP-9
and VCAM-1 expressions. Preadministration with XQ-1H
after MCAO in hyperlipidemic rats remarkably suppressed
its expression.

XQ-1H Inhibited Excessive Secretion of Inflammatory
Mediators from rBMECs After H/R Injury
Our previous study indicated that cell viability of rBMECs
decreased after H/R injury [18] in an in vitro model of ischemia and reperfusion. As presented in Table 4, H/R injury
markedly promotes inflammatory cytokine release from
rBMECs, such as TNF-α and NO. XQ-1H at the concentration of 10, 3, and 1 μM could significantly inhibit this tendency (P<0.01, P<0.05).

XQ-1H Protected Cell Viability When rBMECs Exposed
to LPS
Cell survival rate, which is calculated by dividing the OD
values in different groups by those in the control group, is an
index of cell viability. Figure 8 shows that the cell viability of
rBMECs significantly decreased to almost 50 % after 2 μg/ml
of LPS incubation for 24 h. Aspirin or XQ-1H (10, 3, and
1 μM) could lessen cell injury (P<0.01, P<0.05).

XQ-1H Attenuated Inflammatory Cytokines over Releasing
When rBMECs Exposed to LPS
The release profile of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α was measured in
the supernatant obtained from rBMEC cultures when exposed
to LPS (Table 5). The results indicated that LPS markedly
induced the over production of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α from
rBMECs compared to the control group. Incubation with aspirin

XQ-1H Regulated NF-κB Inflammatory Signal
and Downstream Proteins When rBMECs Exposed to LPS
Western blotting results are shown in Figs. 9 and 10. VCAM-1
and iNOS expression in rBMECs were significantly augmented when treated with LPS. Incubation with aspirin or
XQ-1H (10 and 3 μM) downregulated the overexpression
of VCAM-1 and MMP-9, which are also related to the
inflammatory reaction (Fig. 9). In addition, XQ-1H could
inhibit NF-κB nuclear translocation (Fig. 10).

Discussion
Our data show clearly for the first time that XQ-1H could
attenuate BBB dysfunction and inhibit inflammation following ischemic stroke in hyperlipidemic rats. The further
mechanism of XQ-1H on stabilizing BBB integrity may
be related to protecting rBMECs from the oversecretion
and overexpression of inflammatory cytokines, and thus
inhibiting inflammatory response.

XQ-1H is a novel ginkgolide B analog and also has potent
platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist property. In our
previous study, intravenous injections of XQ-1H could alleviate transient and permanent ischemic injury in rats [15,
16]. It was well accepted that PAF contributed to
inflammation-mediated tissue injury following ischemic
stroke [32]. Impairment of the BBB is a critical step in
the development and progression of cerebral ischemia
[33], and further research declared that XQ-1H could
protect against PAF-induced BBB disruption by downregulating inflammatory cytokines iNOS and ICAM-1 [18, 34].

Therefore, PAF antagonizing inhibiting inflammation may be
the key contributor to BBB protection of XQ-1H.
A cholesterol-rich diet directly causes hyperlipidemia, or
high cholesterol, which has a potential risk for cardiovascular
or CNS diseases. Hyperlipidemia has been reported to be
associated with immune dysfunction and inflammation. A
high-cholesterol diet induces an elevated pro-inflammatory
response. This correlates well with the high plasma cholesterol
status, which verifies that hyperlipidemia is also related to
chronic inflammation. Simvastatin, a widely used statin, could
block BBB leakage resulted from elevated cholesterol [35],
which means hyperlipidemia is one of the major risk factors
against BBB in ischemic conditions. Therefore, we
established an in vivo model of ischemic stroke coexistence
with hyperlipidemia. With our current research, we aimed to
find out whether and how XQ-1H alleviates ischemic injury
by protecting against BBB dysfunction. To do so, an
intragastric administration of XQ-1H to rats for 7 days was
delivered, as its effects were verified in our previous research.
Systemic inflammation can stimulate and exacerbate the
CNS inflammation, potentially leading to exacerbation of
preexisting neurodegenerative disease, such as Alzheimer’s
disease, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson’s disease [36]. How
inflammation can affect cerebral ischemia is still not fully
understood or researched. As our results reveal that, compared
to normal diet rats, more severe BBB disruption can be found
in hyperlipidemic rats following ischemic stroke. This

severity of BBB disruption can be seen in various measures,
such as EB leakage, brain edema, and pathology of brain
endothelial cells. In addition, hyperlipidemia also mediates
an excessive inflammatory response, such as aggravating
pro-inflammatory cytokines release, worsening leukocyte infiltration and upregulating MMP-9 and VCAM-1 expressions.
This finding gives evidence to the relationship between
hyperlipidemia and inflammation and thus verifies that
hyperlipidemia-induced systemic inflammation could exacerbate ischemia by further worsening BBB breakdown following MCAO. The cytokine and BBB interaction and
cytokine-induced leukocyte migration may be the main possible mechanisms involved in the CNS inflammation [37].
BBB disruption was partially mediated by pro-inflammatory
cytokines released from activated glial and endothelial cells,
such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α [38].
Hyperlipidemic rats treated with XQ-1H for 7 days could
extenuate BBB hyperpermeability [39], extenuate severe brain
edema, and improve microvascular endothelial dysfunction

when exposed to ischemic stroke. These investigations
indicate that XQ-1H protects the BBB against disruption
following ischemic stroke with coincidence of dyslipidemia and
thus alleviates ischemic infarction. Further, preadministration of
XQ-1H could inhibit inflammatory cytokine oversecretion, leukocyte infiltration, and VCAM-1 and MMP-9 overexpressions.
The results demonstrated that suppression of inflammation by
XQ-1H might partially contribute to BBB stabilization, extenuate peripheral inflammatory response penetration into brain, and
further alleviate brain inflammation and BBB breakdown.
Endothelial cell activation is the key early inflammatory
response to ischemia or inflammation. Activated endothelial
cells increase expression of adhesion molecules and
chemokines, which in turn promote infiltration of immune
cells, such as neutrophils. Therefore, the phenotypic changes
in endothelial cells occur early during an ischemic stroke.
Additionally, pathways critical to endothelial cell function
may provide therapeutic targets for treatment of stroke. Our
results show that H/R injury induces the overproduction of

rBMECs when exposed to H/R injury. Preincubation with
XQ-1H could reduce inflammatory cytokine releasing.
Ghanim reported that in taking a high-fat and highcarbohydrate diet, it acutely induces an increase in plasma
LPS, NF-κB binding activity, and plasma MMP-9 concentrations [40]. From this foundational report, we used LPS, which

is widely used for inflammation models, to assess possible
mechanisms of XQ-1H on BBB inflammatory injury. LPS can
mimic the process of inflammation in BBB breakdown in vivo
as previously described [41, 42]. Two micrograms per milliliter of LPS induced significant cell injury and oversecretion
of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which could be reversed by
XQ-1H preincubaiton with rBMECs. LPS increases overexpression of NF-κB and cell-adhesion molecules (VCAM-1,

ICAM-1) on the surface of endothelial cells [43]. Our present
data further showed that XQ-1H downregulated the overexpression of VCAM-1 and iNOS, inhibited nuclear translocation when rBMECs exposed to LPS, which means that the
suppressive aspect of the inflammatory response might be
possible mechanism of XQ-1H on BBB protection.
In conclusion, XQ-1H extenuates the aggressive accumulation of inflammatory cells and alleviates BBB disruption
after ischemic stroke in hyperlipidemic rats, which contributed
to improving ischemic stroke. Alternatively, reduction in the
consumption of high-cholesterol diet may be beneficial in
alleviating the severity of ischemic injury as an adjunctive
therapy. Further experimental and clinical studies will be
required to assess the potential clinical application of XQ1H, and these findings would be advantageous in the development of new strategies to evaluate anti-ischemia agents.
