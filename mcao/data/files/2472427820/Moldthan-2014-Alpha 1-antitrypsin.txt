Our objective is to develop a new therapy for the treatment of stroke. Currently, the
only effective therapy for acute ischemic stroke is the thrombolytic agent recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator. a1-Antitrypsin (AAT), a serine proteinase inhibitor with
potent anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, antimicrobial, and cytoprotective activities,
could be beneficial in stroke. The goal of this study is to test whether AATcan improve
ischemic stroke outcome in an established rat model. Middle cerebral artery occlusion
was induced in male rats via intracranial (i.c.) microinjection of endothelin-1. Five to 10
minutes after stroke induction, rats received either i.c. or intravenous delivery of human AAT. Cylinder and vibrissae tests were used to evaluate sensorimotor function
before and 72 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct volumes were examined via either 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay or magnetic resonance imaging 72 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Despite equivalent initial strokes, at
72 hours, the infarct volumes of the human AAT treatment groups (local and systemic
injection) were statistically significantly reduced by 83% and 63% (P , .0001 and
P , .05, respectively) compared with control rats. Human AAT significantly limited
sensory motor system deficits. Human AAT could be a potential novel therapeutic
drug for the protection against neurodegeneration after ischemic stroke, but more
studies are needed to investigate the protective mechanisms and efficacy in other animal models. Key Words: Ischemic stroke—alpha 1-antitrypsin—inflammation—
endothelin-1–induced MCAO—neuroprotection—anti-inflammation.

Introduction
Worldwide, there are more than 50 million survivors of
stroke and transient ischemic attack,1 producing
an immense burden on the health care infrastructure
and national economies.2 At present, recombinant tissue

of rtPA are dissolving blood clots and promoting reperfusion. In the United States, less than 2% of stroke patients
are able to access rtPA treatment, most frequently because
of delays in patient evaluation.2

Ischemic stroke, the most prevalent type, initiates a series
of events including cellular bioenergetic failure, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, microvascular injury, homeostatic activation, and
inflammation.3,4 Although restoring perfusion via rtPA to
the ischemic tissue is important, cascades of necrosis,
apoptosis, and inflammation commence within minutes
of severe deprivation. Increasing evidence shows that
genetically programmed cell death during postischemic
tissue inflammation (which can last days to weeks)
contributes significantly to the ultimate pathology.5-7
Therefore, therapies that may target these aspects of
ischemia are needed to improve the outcome of stroke.
Alpha 1-antitrypsin (AAT) is a conserved serum proteinase inhibitor that has anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic,
and cytoprotective properties. AATis primarily synthesized
in the liver,8 secreted into the blood stream (1.0-2.5 mg/mL),
and is relatively stable with a half-life of 4-5 days in humans.9,10 Previous studies have demonstrated that AAT
inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines
(interleukin [IL]-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a), and enhances
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 production by increasing
cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels.11,12 AAT
has shown anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects as
early as 2 hours and as late as 24 hours after kidney
ischemia/reperfusion in an animal model by inhibiting
neutrophil superoxide production, TNF-a production, and
decreasing caspase-1 and caspase-3–like activities.13,14
AAT-mediated interruption of IL-8 binding to its receptors
limits neutrophil infiltration in the lungs.15 In addition to inhibiting serine proteases, AATalso inhibits cysteine proteinase activity (eg, caspase-3). Coupled with the ability to enter
cells, this protein has been shown to protect pancreatic
b cells, lung, kidney, and liver cells against caspasedependent apoptosis.16,17 Based on these activities of AAT,
we hypothesized that it may hold therapeutic potential in
limiting stroke pathology that results from intrinsic
inflammatory and proteolytic processes. In the present
study, we tested whether AAT may be protective in an
endothelin-1 (ET-1)–induced transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model in rats.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Rat endothelin-1 (ET-1), molecular weight 5 2492.0,
purchased from American Peptide Company, Inc.

(Sunnyvale, CA), was dissolved in sterile phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) to make a stock concentration
of 80 mM. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) was obtained from Fisher Scientific, Inc. (Pittsburgh, PA). Clinical grade human alpha 1-antitrypsin (hAAT, Prolastin
C; Grifols, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC) was
dissolved in sterile water following the manufacturer’s
instruction.

Animals
All procedures were performed with prior approval
from the University of Florida Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Male Sprague–Dawley rats,
7-8 weeks in age (weight 220-250 g), were purchased
from Charles River Laboratories International, Inc. (Wilmington, MA). The rats were acclimated for 3 or more
days before the start of any experiments. Animals with
incomplete data sets because of death and nonresponse
to behavior tests were eliminated from the study data.
A model of transient/reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using ET-1 was employed and
generated as previously described.18 Briefly, under
aseptic conditions, animal was anesthetized and the
scalp was retracted, and a midline incision was made
in the skin from the point above bregma until the
lambda point. A small hole (3 mm in diameter) was
drilled in the cranium adjacent to the left MCA at
.2 mm anterior, 5.2 mm lateral, and 1.0 mm from the
ventral skull surface. A 27-gauge needle was used to
inject ET-1 or hAAT at a rate of 1 mL/min. After ET-1 injection, the needle was left in place for an additional
3 minutes before being slowly withdrawn. The injection
system was flushed by distilled water and loaded with
subsequent treatment agents (intracranial [i.c.] delivery
experiments only). The detailed schedule for treatments
is described in Tables 1 and 2. Animals were examined
daily during the acute postoperative period. No animals
required treatment or euthanasia during the postoperative period.

Treatments
In this study, human AAT was delivered by methods,
that is, i.c. and intravenous (i.v.) administration. For the
i.c. injection, 3 mL of either hAAT (70 mg) or PBS (as a control) were injected into the parenchyma approximately
5-10 minutes after ET-1 injection. For i.v., a dose

doses of ET-1 and hAAT were determined based on our
previous experiments in other animal models.17-19

Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging
A laser Doppler imaging system (MOORLDI; Moor
Instrument Ltd, Wilmington, DE) was used to measure
the relative flux/perfusion of the brain that is strongly
associated with the spatial and temporal characteristics
of the changes in cerebral blood flow response.20-22
Imaging studies measuring sequential perfusion
changes after ischemia often require the animals to be
immobilized for long periods of time (at least 2.5 hours).
Isoflurane, a volatile anesthetic, has been shown to
reduce early neuronal death in animal models of focal
cerebral ischemia.23 Therefore, to avoid the influence of
isoflurane, animals used in these studies, exposed to isoflurane for approximately 3 h, were not used for testing
the therapeutic effects and were killed after the last measurement (survival time was about 4 hours).
The treatment details were exactly the same as those
described in the sections of ‘‘Animals’’ and ‘‘Treatments,’’
except that an aCSF group was not included. One animal
died during imaging because of isoflurane overdose and
was replaced to provide 3 animals per treatment. The imaging was performed at 4 different time points: preinjection, 10-20 minutes, 30-35 minutes, and 55-65 minutes
after ET-1 injection. The pseudocoloring of relative flux
(number of red blood cells multiplied by speed) illustrates

ments. Percent reductions of perfusion on the injected
side of the brain were calculated using equation 1:
Fluxð%Þ5

(Eq. 1)

where Fi is the flux value of the ipsilateral side (injected
side) and Fc is the flux value of the contralateral side
(opposite or unaffected side).

Cylinder Test
The cylinder test was performed as previously
described with slight modification.18,25 Briefly, the test
rat was placed inside a clear glass cylinder (40 cm
height, 20 cm in diameter) to test the forelimb use
behavior, which can reveal functional asymmetries
resulting from different forms of brain injury, including
cortical damage26 and nigrostriatal neurodegeneration.27
Digital video recordings of vertical exploration during
3 minutes of trials were scored offline frame-by-frame.

Vibrissae Test
Measurement of forelimb asymmetry was scored using
the vibrissae test (evoked forelimb placing) as previously
described.18,27 An NTSC camera was used to record
digital video of 10 iterations of vibrissae stimulation
and the corresponding responses, for each side, for each
animal. The delay of forelimb placing for each side was
expressed by relative time response and calculated
using equation 2:

with an arbitrarily assigned unit from 0 (lower limit) to

pixel, scan area was about 1.8 3 2.3 cm, and the total
scan duration per animal was approximately 10 minutes.

Histopathology
The 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
assay is one of the most commonly used methods to
measure ischemic lesions.28-31 Animals in control and
treatment groups were killed at day 3 after ET-1 injection.
The brains were quickly isolated, placed in cold
PBS (0 C-4 C) for 30 minutes, and then sectioned into

2-mm-thick coronal slices using a brain slice matrix (Leica
Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL). The tissue sections
were held in cold PBS for 3 minutes before they were
incubated in TTC solution (.05% TTC in PBS) for 30 minutes at 37 C. The sections were washed 3 times (1 minute
each) with PBS and fixed in .1 M phosphate-buffered
formaldehyde. Calibrated digital images of tissue sections
were made at 600-dpi scanner resolution with 48-bit color
and saved as TIFF files.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Three days after ET-1 injection, brain damage was visualized in live animals from the groups ET-1 alone (n 5 8)
and ET-1 1 hAAT (i.v.) (n 5 14) maintained under 1%-2%
isoflurane anesthesia in the Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy facility at the McKnight
Brain Institute of the University of Florida. An 11 T/
470 MHz MRI Spectrometer (Magnex Instruments, Yarnton, Oxford, UK) using a Bruker Avance Console and Paravision software (Bruker BioSpin MRI, Inc., Billerica, MA)
was used to generate a standard T2-weighted spin-echo
sequence (rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement) through continuous 1-mm-thick sections covering
the entire brain region. Body temperature was monitored
and maintained with heated ventilation at 35 C-37 C for
the entire scan time. Total acquisition time for MR imaging was about 35 minutes.

Image Analysis
Infarct areas of brain slices from all experiments,
including from TTC assay and magnetic resonance imaging, were analyzed in a blinded manner using the NIH
ImageJ version 5.0 (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij) and Jim version
5.0, respectively. Regions of interest were created encompassing infarct areas of each section (in mm2), and total
infarct sizes for each rat were operationally defined as
the sum of infarct areas over all slices in which they
appeared.

Quantification hAAT in the Brain
Following magnetic resonance imaging, sample brains
(n 5 4 for both hAAT i.v. and saline groups) were extracted and frozen at 280 C. Brains were homogenized
using 3 mL lysis buffer. After centrifugation, hAAT
concentrations were determined by hAAT-specific
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously
described.32,33

Statistical Analysis
Unless specified, all data are expressed as arithmetic
mean 6 SEM. Two-way analysis of variance (time and
treatment) was followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests
to compare behavioral dependent variables between
groups. Comparisons of infarct area were made by

2-tailed Student t test; and P values less than .05 were
considered to be significant. Comparisons of brain
hAAT concentrations were done by Mann–Whitney test
after F test showing significant differences (P , .0001) between group variances.

Results
Human AAT Did Not Affect the ET-1–Induced
Ischemia
To test the effects of hAAT on MCAO induced by ET-1,
cohorts (9 rats were divided randomly into 3 equal
groups) of rats were stereotaxically injected with ET-1
adjacent to the left MCA of the brain. About 10-15 minutes
after ET-1 injection, hAAT or saline was i.c. injected at the
same site in 2 groups (ET1 1 hAAT [i.c.] and ET-1 1 saline
groups), and the third group (ET1 1 hAAT [i.v.] group)
received hAAT i.v. The relative reduction in flux in rat
brain was measured using a laser Doppler scanner. As
shown in Figure 1, A, calculations made using equation
1 showed that approximately 20 minutes after the ET-1 injection, the flux statistic at the injection site dropped
markedly from approximately 1600 perfusion units to
less than 900 perfusion units in all groups (ie, ET-1 1 saline group, ET-1 1 hAAT [i.c.], and ET1 1 hAAT [i.v.]
groups). The average relative flux values in all groups
were reduced by 40%-50% compared with the baseline.
The maximally reduced flux was maintained for up to
35 minutes, followed by the initiation of reperfusion
(Fig 1, B). No significant difference among the 3 groups
was detected; illustrating that hAAT, either locally or systemically, did not alter the ischemic induction by ET-1.

Local Delivery of hAAT Mitigates ET-1–Induced Stroke
Outcome
In a separate experiment, 3 rats were i.c. injected with
ET-1 and hAAT as previously described. Data from the
control groups, receiving aCSF or ET-1 alone, were
retrieved from our previous study 18 as the set of experiments were performed during the same time and using
identical methodology. Three days after ET-1 injection,
behavioral tests and brain damage evaluation were performed.
Cylinder test results showed that animal behavior was
normal before treatment, that is, both forelimbs were used
for postural support in aCSF, ET-1–alone, and ET-1 1
AAT (i.c.) groups 80.00% 6 7.0%, 79.20% 6 5.16%, and
82.50% 6 4.15% of the time, respectively; with no statistically significant difference among the 3 groups (Fig 2).
Three days after ET-1 injection, the use of both forelimbs
in the ET-1–alone group was significantly reduced
(22.6% 6 6.3%), indicating profound impairment of
contralateral forelimb function, whereas no impairment
was observed in the group that received the aCSF injection (76.67% 6 4.08%). In the hAAT treatment group,

All rats were injected with ET-1 (240 pmol in
3 mL phosphate-buffered saline) proximal to the
left MCA. About 5-10 minutes after ET-1 injection, hAAT (1.35 nmol in 3 mL saline for i.c. or
192 nmol in 1 mL saline for i.v.) was administered at the same site in the 2 groups. The dotted,
closed diamond solid, and closed triangle solid
lines represent the average levels in ET-1–alone,
hAAT (i.c.), and hAAT (i.v.) groups, respectively; n 5 3 for all groups. The differences at
all time points of all groups were not statistically
significant. Data are mean 6 SEM. Abbreviations: ET-1, endothelin-1; hAAT, human alpha
1-antitrypsin; PU, perfusion unit.

ET-1 1 AAT (i.c.), the use of forelimb was significantly
higher than that in ET-1–alone group (60.00% 6 6.10%,
P , .05). These results clearly demonstrate that local
administration of hAAT mitigated the deficit of motor
function caused by ischemic stroke in rats.
Vibrissae tests were performed to test the effect of
hAAT on sensorimotor function. We measured forelimb
placing time before and 3 days after ET-1 injection and
calculated relative time response that represented the
time to place forelimb as a fold increase of pretreatment
tests (using equation 2). As shown in Figure 3, the ipsilateral relative time responses in aCSF, ET-1–alone, and ET-1
1 hAAT groups were 1.53 6 .50, 1.75 6 .19, and
1.53 6 .16, respectively, and no statistically significant difference was observed among the groups. These data indicated that ipsilateral forelimb placing was not affected by
the middle cerebral artery occlusion or AAT treatment in
rats after 3 days. Intriguingly, contralateral forelimb relative time responses in ET-1 1 hAAT (i.c.) group were

significantly smaller than those in the ET-1–alone group
(7.61 6 .63 and 20.96 6 4.70, respectively), indicating
that hAAT treatment can limit the loss of sensorimotor
function induced by MCAO in the rat model. The contralateral forelimb relative time response in the aCSF group
remained near 1 (1.27 6 .15) and significantly smaller
compared with ET-1–alone group. These data confirmed
that ET-1 injection induced profound sensorimotor deficits in contralateral forelimb placing responses that were
not affected by the surgery procedure.
Infarct size results based on TTC assays are presented
in Figure 4. The average of total infarct areas of the model
group (receiving ET-1 alone) was significantly larger than
that of the hAAT treatment group (198.90 6 13.30 mm2
and 33.70 6 2.80 mm2, respectively, P , .001). These results indicate that the local hAAT delivery significantly
reduced the infarct zone by approximately 83%. Typically,
the infarct in the model group involved the rostrocentral
dorsolateral cortex, subcortex, and basal ganglia, whereas

in the treatment group the infarct area was more limited
to the cortex region.

Systemic Delivery of hAAT Mitigated ET-1–Induced
Stroke Outcome
Although direct local injection of hAAT clearly prevented brain damage from ET1-induced MCAO, this
invasive approach is clinically unfeasible. To test the effect of systemic hAAT delivery on ischemic stroke, we
performed experiments using separate groups of animals.
Because we found no effects from aCSF in the previous
studies, only control and hAAT treatment groups were
used. Eight rats in the control group received ET-1 (i.c.)
and 1 mL of sterile saline (hAAT vehicle) i.v. Fourteen
rats in the AAT treatment group were i.c. injected with
ET-1 and systemically (i.v.) injected with hAAT (40 mg/
kg, i.v.) immediately after ET-1 injection.

Cylinder test results showed that animal behavior was
normal before treatment, that is, both forelimbs were used
for postural support against cylinder walls of ET-1 1
saline and ET-1 1 hAAT (i.v.) groups on 84.5% 6 1.2%
and 87.9% 6 3.2% of events, respectively, with no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups (Fig 5).
Three days after the injections, both groups revealed
significant deficits compared with pretreatment. However, the hAAT treatment group showed significant
deficit reduction in using 2 forelimbs for cylinder exploration compared with the controls (72.6% 6 6.2% and
35.4% 6 5.9%, respectively, P , .001), indicating that i.v.
delivery of hAAT can ameliorate motor function deficit
induced by ET-1–induced cerebral ischemia.
Results from vibrissae test are shown in Figure 6. The
contralateral relative time response in ET1 1 hAAT (i.v.)
groups was significantly smaller than that of the ET-1 1
saline group (2.39 6 .43 and 4.01 6 .87, respectively).
Consistent with unilateral motor system injury, the ipsilateral side to the injection side was not affected by the
MCA occlusion (1.27 6 .23 and .99 6 .11, respectively).
These results indicated that i.v. delivery of hAAT can mitigate sensorimotor function deficit caused by ischemic
stroke.

P less than .05, indicating that systemically administered
hAAT significantly reduced the infarct zone by approximately 63%. A sample of these brains analyzed for
hAAT concentration showed that ET-1 1 saline–injected
controls had a calculated concentration of 11.21 6 .21 ng
of hAAT per gram of brain tissue (below the detectable
range of the assay). The ET-1 1 hAAT (i.v.) group had a

ciency. Our laboratory has been investigating its functions
and has shown its beneficial effects in several different
experimental models of diseases, including rheumatoid
arthritis,11,19 diabetes,34,35,36 and bone loss.37 However,
the effect of AAT on brain injury induced by stroke has
never been reported. In this study, we demonstrated
that hAAT therapy protected against brain tissue injury
and improved stroke outcome. Human AAT has been
used to treat AAT-deficient patients for many years and
has shown low or no side effects.38 Considering its excellent safety profile, the current results suggest potential for
a new clinical application of hAAT in the treatment of
stroke and, perhaps, other brain diseases associated
with inflammation and programmed cell death.
A growing body of literature shows that hAAT has antiinflammatory and cytoprotective properties.39 In this
study, we showed that local delivery of hAAT protected
ET-1–induced brain injury and mitigated behavioral deficits. Although the mechanism of this protection remains
to be further investigated, it is possible that hAAT inhibits
ischemia- and reperfusion-induced neuron cell death by inhibiting caspase-1 and caspase-3.16,17 Human AAT may
also inhibit local expression of ischemia- and reperfusioninduced inflammatory cytokines and activated astrocytes

or microglia. Therefore, administration of hAAT to the site
of ischemic stroke insult may mitigate cell death and inflammatory responses.
It is intriguing that systemic delivery of hAAT significantly improves stroke outcome and is detectable in the
brain. Because AAT is a 52-kD glycoprotein thought to
have limited ability to pass through an intact BBB,40 the
following possible mechanisms may contribute to its protective effects. First, ET-1 is a known mediator that
directly increases BBB permeability.41 Also, stroke increases BBB permeability to macromolecules, that is,
immunoglobulin M (450 kD).42 Second, ET-1–induced
ischemia/reperfusion can lead to dysfunction of endothelial cells and phasic leaking of the BBB.43 Third, the injection of ET-1 possibly causes local mechanical compromise
of the BBB. In all cases, circulating hAAT passes through
the BBB, reaching the impaired area of the brain and displaying local protective functions. A fourth possibility is
that hAAT may indirectly reduce brain tissue damage
by inhibiting the infiltration and migration of lymphocytes to the penumbra of the ischemic region.15 By this
mechanism, systemic administration of hAAT could be
clinically beneficial even if it does not penetrate the brain
itself. Although the beneficial effects of systemic administration of hAAT may be limited after the recovery of BBB,
such treatment may also protect the brain from the recurrence of stroke, which occurs frequently. In addition,
because BBB damage in stroke is partly induced by the inflammatory response and results in pathogenic vasogenic
edema, hAAT, as an anti-inflammatory protein, may also
promote maintenance and restoration of BBB integrity.
In the present study, approximately 20 minutes after ET1 injection, relative cerebral blood flow rapidly decreased
to 40%-50% of baseline in all animals and remained maximally decreased for at least 20-30 minutes. The result is
consistent with the previous study that showed that microinjection of ET-1 near MCA induced a blood flow reduction
of 30%-75% in the region supplied by the artery.44,45 There
was no significant difference among the 3 groups in
cerebral blood flow reduction, indicating that hAAT had
no direct influence on ET-1–induced MCAO. Therefore,
our results indicate that the protective effects of hAAT
are mediated not through blocking the activity of ET-1
but rather by blocking the subsequent biochemical/inflammatory responses and limiting damage. We chose to use an
ET-1 stroke model because the microinjection near the middle cerebral artery is simple and minimally invasive, thus,
often resulting in a high animal survival rate, which is
important for studies of neuroprotective drugs.46 However, the reperfusion process is ET-1 dose dependent.47 In
our experiments using laser Doppler perfusion imaging,
reperfusion began as early as 55 minutes to as long as
more than 2 hours after ET-1 application, proving a source
of possible variability. Another issue is that ET-1 can
induce astrocytosis and facilitates axonal sprouting that
may interfere with the interpretation of neural repair ex-

48

periments. Also the use of ET-1 to induce a vasospasm
stroke model does not result in a blood clot that is typical
in thrombotic and embolic strokes in humans. Given the
limitations of ET-1 mouse model, future studies using
different animal models will provide a better understanding of the neuroprotective effects of AAT.
In the present study, we treated the animals with hAAT
(i.c. and i.v.) 5-10 minutes after the ET-1 induction.
Although such interval is enough to avoid the interaction
of hAAT with ET-1 as discussed earlier, we consider that
the protective effect observed in these experiments are preventive but not injury reversing. Whether hAAT can be
effective after the onset of the insult, and the effect of delay
on therapeutic effect, will require further investigation.

Conclusions
Both local and systemic deliveries of hAAT resulted in
neuroprotection and mitigation of behavioral deficits
induced by ischemic stroke in rats. Systemic delivery resulted in detectable concentrations of hAAT in the brain
3 days after injection. Results from this study indicate a
promising new application of hAAT as a therapy for
ischemic stroke.
