Inflammation that contributes to acute cerebrovascular disease is
driven by the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 and is known
to exacerbate resulting injury. The activity of interleukin-1 is regulated by multimolecular protein complexes called inflammasomes.
There are multiple potential inflammasomes activated in diverse
diseases, yet the nature of the inflammasomes involved in brain
injury is currently unknown. Here, using a rodent model of stroke,
we show that the NLRC4 (NLR family, CARD domain containing 4)
and AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasomes contribute to
brain injury. We also show that acute ischemic brain injury is regulated by mechanisms that require ASC (apoptosis-associated specklike protein containing a CARD), a common adaptor protein for several inflammasomes, and that the NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain
containing 3) inflammasome is not involved in this process. These
discoveries identify the NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes as potential therapeutic targets for stroke and provide new insights into
how the inflammatory response is regulated after an acute injury
to the brain.

P

roinflammatory cytokines of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family
are critical regulators of host responses to infection and orchestrate damaging inflammatory responses that occur during
disease (1). One of the main mediators of damaging sterile inflammation is IL-1β, which is implicated in the etiology of many
major diseases, including acute cerebrovascular disease (2).
Acute cerebrovascular disease presents as a range of conditions,
including devastating injuries such as subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH) and ischemic stroke, which account for up to 10% of
mortality worldwide and are the leading cause of morbidity (2).
Treatments for acute stroke are limited to thrombolysis for up
to 10% of all strokes, antiplatelet agents, and stroke unit care.
Thus, treatment of acute cerebrovascular disease remains an
area of unmet clinical need. Understanding the mechanisms
regulating production of IL-1β during ischemic brain injury may
lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets.
IL-1β is produced by many cells, most commonly those of
macrophage lineage, as a pro–IL-1β precursor. Pro–IL-1β is expressed in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs) or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
that bind to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to up-regulate
proinflammatory gene expression (3, 4). PAMPs are motifs
carried by pathogens, such as bacterial endotoxin (or LPS), and
DAMPs are commonly endogenous molecules released by necrosis. Pro–IL-1β is inactive and remains intracellular until a
further PAMP or DAMP stimulation activates cytosolic PRRs,
often of the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat
containing receptor (NLR) family, to form large multiprotein
complexes called inflammasomes (5). These complexes consist of
the PRR, procaspase-1, and, depending upon the PRR, an
adaptor protein called ASC, that interact via CARD and pyrin
homology-binding domains (5). When the PRR senses PAMPs

4050–4055 | PNAS | March 31, 2015 | vol. 112 | no. 13

or DAMPs, it recruits ASC, which in turn recruits caspase-1,
causing its activation. Caspase-1 then processes pro–IL-1β to a
mature form that is rapidly secreted from the cell (5). The activation of caspase-1 can also cause cell death (6).
A number of inflammasome-forming PRRs have been identified, including NLR family, pyrin domain containing 1 (NLRP1);
NLRP3; NLRP6; NLRP7; NLRP12; NLR family, CARD domain
containing 4 (NLRC4); AIM 2 (absent in melanoma 2); IFI16;
and RIG-I (5). Of these inflammasomes identified to date, the
best characterized, and most strongly associated with sterile inflammation, is formed by NLRP3 (7). Indeed, there are now
several studies suggesting that NLRP3 inflammasomes contribute
to ischemic brain injury (8, 9). However, the picture is more
complicated. NLRP1 inflammasomes have been implicated in
several models of brain injury (6, 10, 11), as have AIM2 inflammasomes, which are suggested to mediate pyroptotic neuronal cell
death (12). There is also evidence supporting a role for caspase-1
in brain injury (13), with a selective caspase-1 inhibitor, VRT018858, a nonpeptide, active metabolite of the prodrug pralnacasan, showing marked protection in a rat model of stroke (14).
However, data for the related caspase-1 inhibitor VRT-043198
suggest that it is also an effective inhibitor of caspase-4 (15),
a human ortholog of caspase-11. Caspase-11 is also implicated in
ischemic brain injury (16, 17), and given that we now also know
Significance
Cerebral ischemia (CI; stroke, brain injury, vascular dementia,
neonatal hypoxia, and many other conditions) affects people at
all stages of life. Of the many diseases associated with CI, stroke
alone causes up to 10% of deaths worldwide and is a leading
cause of disability; yet treatment options are extremely limited,
so this represents an area of massive unmet clinical need. Inflammation involving the cytokine interleukin-1 is a major contributor to cell death in the ischemic brain. Inflammation can be
regulated by large protein complexes called inflammasomes.
Here we show that the NLRC4 (NLR family, CARD domain containing 4) and AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasomes, but
not the NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome, contribute to inflammation and injury in an ischemic
brain and are thus potential therapeutic targets for these devastating diseases.

that the original caspase-1−/− mouse is also deficient in caspase-11
(18), it is clear that caspase-11 could have a role in ischemic brain
injury. Our aim here was to elucidate which inflammasomes
contribute to ischemic brain injury, using mice in which specific
inflammasome components are deleted (−/−).

protected (Fig. 1 A and B). This was not due to altered cerebral
perfusion during MCAo (Fig. 1C) or after induction of reperfusion. ASC−/− mice also had improved neurological outcomes
following MCAo compared with WT and NLRP3−/−, which were
similar (Fig. 1D). We also found that brain injury was not altered
by knockout of the noninflammasome-forming PRR NOD2 (19)
(Fig. 1 A–D). Thus, after MCAo, ASC is likely to regulate assembly of inflammasomes via activation of PRRs other than
NLRP3 (Fig. 1E).
Microglial activation (Iba1+, ramified cells, expressing low
levels of CD45), leukocyte recruitment (round or elongated cells,
expressing high levels of CD45; Fig. S1), and vascular activation
were also reduced in the brains of ASC−/− mice after MCAo
(Fig. 2 D–H). However, numbers of microglia expressing IL-1α
and IL-1β after MCAo were equivalent in the brains of WT,
NLRP3−/−, or ASC−/− mice (Fig. 2 A–C and Fig. S2A). These
findings suggest that following MCAo, inflammation and injury
progressed independently of the canonical sensor of sterile damage,
the NLRP3 inflammasome.
The lack of NLRP3 involvement after MCAo was unexpected
and suggests that other inflammasomes must contribute to sterile
inflammation in the brain. Available evidence suggests that
AIM2 could have a role in sterile inflammatory responses (20),
whereas the other inflammasome-forming receptors appear to
depend upon a microbial presence. To investigate the involvement of additional PRRs, we induced MCAo in AIM2−/− and
NLRC4−/− mice. AIM2 recognizes pathogen and host doublestranded DNA and is composed of a pyrin domain and a DNAbinding HIN domain, and thus AIM2 inflammasomes have an
absolute requirement for ASC to recruit and activate caspase-1
(21, 22). NLRC4 has a CARD domain and can directly interact
with procaspase-1, although the presence of ASC is known to
enhance NLRC4 inflammasome formation (5). AIM2−/− and
NLRC4−/− mice had reduced injury and improved behavioral
outcomes after MCAo, compared with WT mice (Fig. 3 A, B,
and D). As with the ASC−/− experiment above (Fig. 1), the enhanced protection in the AIM2−/− and NLRC4−/− mice was not
due to altered cerebral perfusion during MCA occlusion (Fig. 3C).
4052 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1419090112

These data suggest that NLRC4 and AIM2 may interact with
ASC to mediate brain injury after MCAo (Fig. 3E).
As with the ASC−/− mice above, microglial activation and leukocyte recruitment were reduced in the brains of AIM2−/− and
NLRC4−/− mice after MCAo (Fig. 4 D and E). Numbers of
microglia expressing IL-1β and IL-1α after MCAo were equivalent
in the brains of WT, AIM2−/−, or NLRC4−/− mice (Fig. 4 A–C and
Fig. S2B). Furthermore, we did not find any significant difference
in IL-1β or IL-1α production (Fig. 4F), as well as CXCL1, TNFα,
IL-6, and IL-10 production (Fig. S3) in the liver and the spleen,
two major organs that are involved in diverse inflammatory/acute
phase responses that contribute to brain injury (23, 24).
Discussion
Here we have shown that ischemic brain injury was reduced in
ASC−/−, AIM2−/−, and NLRC4−/− mice and not in mice deficient
for the canonical sensor of sterile injury, NLRP3. These data
provide the first (to our knowledge) evidence for multiple inflammasomes regulating neuronal injury, identifying AIM2 and
NLRC4 as key drivers of sterile inflammatory responses in
the brain.
NLRC4 is regarded as a sensor of pathogenic bacteria (25),
and thus to see it contributing to ischemic brain injury, a model
of sterile inflammation, was an unexpected result. NLRC4
inflammasome activation is, however, also reported in a model of
alcohol-induced liver damage (26) and also to regulate tumorigenesis in an inflammation-induced model of colorectal cancer
(27). In these conditions it is possible that host microbiota contribute to the inflammatory response. However, our results may
also suggest that microbiota do not contribute to brain injury via
recognition of peptidoglycan-derived peptides by NOD2. We
know that both systemic and central IL-1–dependent inflammation drives injury in experimental cerebral ischemia (28), and
thus there is a possibility that NLRC4 drives a systemic inflammatory response following the translocation of gut bacteria/
products. However, although there was a characteristic systemic
inflammatory response following MCAo, it was identical between the WT and inflammasome knockout strains (Fig. 4).
Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that early actions
Denes et al.

mediated by circulating leukocytes or inflammatory mediators
could contribute to some of the differences observed in the knockout strains.
Thus, our data provide the first to our knowledge information
that NLRC4 could be a DAMP sensor in brain inflammation.
However, sterile inflammatory conditions involving NLRC4 in
other tissues are now emerging in the literature. Autoinflammatory conditions caused by activating mutations in NLRC4
(similar to the CAPS syndromes caused by activating mutations
in NLRP3) have been described recently (29–31). NLRP3 is
regarded as the canonical sensor of sterile injury or stress, and so
to consider how NLRC4 may sense DAMPs it is sensible to draw
comparisons to NLRP3. Given the diverse structures of DAMPs
that activate NLRP3 and the fact that no direct interactions
have been observed, a direct interaction between a DAMP and
NLRP3 is unlikely (32), and no accessory receptors have been
described. Rather, the cellular stress imposed by DAMPs is
suggested to give rise to a number of potential mechanisms that
lead to posttranslational modification of NLRP3, leading to its
activation (32). NLRC4 does not sense bacterial ligands directly
but does so through coreceptors called NAIP proteins (33).
Given that the NAIP proteins specifically and directly bind and
sense bacterial proteins (34), it is unlikely that NAIPs also bind
diverse DAMPs. This raises the possibility of specific host protein DAMPs that are homologous with bacterial NAIP ligands,
or that certain DAMPs or tissue/cellular stresses activate posttranslational mechanisms, causing activation of NLRC4. Recent
work from our group and others has identified ubiquitin posttranslational modification of NLRP3 inflammasome components
as a key integrator of diverse DAMP signals (35–38). Interestingly, ubiquitination has also been suggested to regulate the
activation of NLRC4 in a model of caspase-8–dependent cell
death (39). Phosphorylation of NLRC4 is also known to be
Denes et al.

pivotal to its activation (40). Thus, cellular/tissue stress may
cause posttranslational modification of NLRC4 inflammasome
components, resulting in NLRC4 inflammasome activation. A
key distinction between NLRP3 and NLRC4 is that NLRP3
requires priming to induce NLRP3 expression before active
NLRP3 inflammasomes can be formed (41). This priming step is
not required for NLRC4 inflammasome activation (42). It is
therefore possible that these pathways operate in the absence of
functional NLRP3. NLRC4 has a CARD domain and can directly interact with procaspase-1, although the presence of ASC
is known to enhance NLRC4–inflammasome-dependent IL-1β
processing (5). Thus, the large protective effect we also observe in
the ASC−/− mice could be in part due to an effect on NLRC4–
inflammasome-dependent IL-1β release. These data therefore
give insights into the regulation of NLRC4 and may trigger new
research into NLRC4 as a sensor of sterile injury.
AIM2 recognizes pathogen and host double-stranded DNA
and is composed of a pyrin domain and a DNA-binding HIN
domain, and thus to recruit caspase-1 into the inflammasome
complex requires ASC as a bridging molecule (21, 22). Cultured
embryonic rat cortical neurons undergo an AIM2–inflammasome-dependent cell death when challenged with the AIM2 activator poly(dA:dT) (12). AIM2 inflammasomes also drive a
protective inflammatory response in the brain, and AIM2−/−
mice show reduced survival in response to central infection with
Staphylococcus aureus (43). This latter study also shows a disconnect between NLRP3 and ASC because ASC−/− mice are also
more susceptible to central S. aureus infection, whereas the
survival of NLRP3−/− mice is comparable to WT (43). These
observations, together with our data, suggest that AIM2 is an
important sensor of infection and injury in the brain in vivo.
We have shown that animals deficient in both IL-1α and IL-1β
have markedly reduced infarct size after MCAo (44), and that

Anakinra (IL-1Ra) is neuroprotective in this model (e.g., for review see ref. 45). These data, and our observations of protection
in the ASC knockout mice, suggest that there is a specific regulation of IL-1 in the brain, and we also have shown previously that
both central and peripheral-derived IL-1 contribute to brain injury
(28). However, inflammatory caspases may also be involved in
neurodegenerative disease in the absence of IL-1 (13), so NLRC4
could also regulate caspase-dependent cell death pathways. AIM2
inflammasomes may also be involved directly in neuronal cell
death, and it has been reported that cultured embryonic rat cortical neurons undergo an AIM2–inflammasome-dependent cell
death when challenged with the AIM2 activator poly(dA:dT) (12).
Thus, inflammasomes may regulate both inflammatory and cell
death pathways that modify ischemic brain injury.
We report that microglial cell activation, leukocyte recruitment, and vascular activation are reduced in the brains of
ASC−/−, AIM2−/−, and NLRC4−/− mice after MCAo (Figs. 2 and
4). It is important to note that these inflammatory changes could
occur as a consequence, in addition to being a cause, of the reduced damage. Changes in inflammatory markers are likely to
result from a reduction in IL-1 processing and secretion but also
result from reduced injury. We have reported previously that
systemic injection of IL-1β increases leukocyte recruitment into
the brain after MCAo and that induced neutropenia in this
model is neuroprotective, suggesting that an IL-1β–dependent
recruitment of leukocytes exacerbates ischemic brain injury (46).
We have also reported that DAMPs can induce inflammasomeindependent chemokine production from cultures of mixed glia
(astrocytes and microglia) in the absence of IL-1, and that in the
brains of IL-1αβ double-knockout mice there is chemokine
production and microglial cell activation (47). Thus, the extent
of microglial cell activation and leukocyte recruitment is likely to
be dependent upon both IL-1–dependent inflammation and
IL-1–independent cell death. In these studies we chose to study
brain injury and inflammation 24 h post MCAo. In this model
the extent of injury is almost completely developed at 24 h
postinjury. This time point is most suitable for proof of concept
studies, when both injury and neurological assessment have to be
performed. Also, we have reported sustained protective effects
of Anakinra up to 48 h post MCAo (48) and 7 d post MCAo,
using a caspase-1 inhibitor (14). Thus, we are confident that the
protective effects observed in ASC−/−, AIM2−/−, and NLRC4−/−
mice are consistent with our previous and other published work.
In the introduction we describe studies suggesting that NLRP3
inflammasomes contribute to ischemic brain injury (8, 9), but
that also NLRP1 inflammasomes are implicated in several
models of brain injury (6, 10, 11), as are AIM2 inflammasomes
(12). Here, using mice deficient in specific inflammasome components, we have shown that ischemic brain injury is profoundly
influenced by multiple inflammasomes and, importantly, here
was independent of the canonical sensor of sterile inflammation,
the NLRP3 inflammasome. We report here an involvement of
NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes, but it is possible that others
known [e.g., NLRP1 (8-10)] and other yet to be fully characterized inflammasomes are also involved.
In rodent models of Alzheimer’s disease the memory deficit
and inflammation have been reported to depend upon the
NLRP3 inflammasome (49), and aggregated Aβ is a DAMP
known to activate NLRP3 (50). However, NLRP1 has also been
implicated in a rodent model of Alzheimer’s disease (51). An
explanation for this difference may be the respective cellular location of the inflammasomes. NLRP3 expressed by microglia
drives inflammation, and NLRP1 expressed by neurons drives
pyroptotic neuronal cell death (51). Thus, activation of multiple
inflammasomes in our model may reflect different cellular compartments and possibly cell death in addition to inflammatory
mechanisms. The types of inflammasome activated in the brain
may also depend upon the nature of the injury. For example, in
4054 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1419090112

a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage the NLRP3 inflammasome is reported to drive brain edema and behavioral deficits
(52). It was reported recently that heme, a breakdown product of
blood, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (53). Thus, in models
of hemorrhagic stroke there is likely to be a significant NLRP3driven component, which was not the case in our study on
cerebral ischemia. Thus, the types of inflammasome activated
reflect their cellular location, the functional output (e.g., cell
death and/or inflammation), and the nature of the injury
(e.g., hemorrhagic versus ischemic stroke). Following our discoveries reported here we can now investigate these mechanisms fully.
Inflammation in the brain affects the outcome of neurodegenerative disease and so is an attractive therapeutic target.
However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating
brain inflammation remain poorly defined. We have discovered
that brain inflammation after cerebral ischemia is regulated by
ASC, AIM2, and NLRC4 inflammasomes. This insight now gives
us the opportunity to fully elucidate inflammatory regulatory networks in the brain and to establish therapeutic targets. The complexity of inflammasome responses in the brain where multiple
inflammasomes are activated in the various neurodegenerative
conditions studied suggests that perhaps the most promising therapeutic antiinflammatory targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease will be ASC and inflammatory caspases.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Experiments were carried out in 12–16-wk-old male mice (n = 71), all
on C57BL/6 background (WT, NLRP3−/−, NOD2−/−, ASC−/−, NLRC4−/−, and
AIM2−/−), breeding at the animal facility of the University of Manchester.
Animals were allowed free access to food and water and maintained under
temperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled conditions. All animal procedures
adhered to the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986), and experiments
were performed in accordance with STAIR and ARRIVE guidelines.
Focal Cerebral Ischemia Induced by Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion. MCAo
was performed, using the intraluminal filament technique, as described
earlier (54). Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane, and a siliconecoated monofilament (210-μm-tip diameter, Doccol) was introduced to the
left external carotid artery and advanced along the internal carotid artery to
occlude the MCA for 45 min, followed by 24 h reperfusion. Occlusion was
confirmed by a laser Doppler (Moor Instruments) measurement of blood
flow, and animals showing less than 80% signal drop compared with baseline or absence of ischemia in the striatum were excluded pre hoc. During
surgery, core temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C. Three mice were
excluded pre hoc from further analysis, due to improper occlusion of the
MCA (n = 1) or surgical artifacts (n = 2).
Tissue Processing. Under terminal anesthesia, animals were perfused transcardially with saline, followed by paraformaldehyde [PFA; 4% (mass/vol) in
PBS, Sigma]. Brains were postfixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C for 24 h, and cryoprotected in sucrose/PBS. Twenty-micrometer-thick coronal brain sections
were cut on a sledge microtome (Bright series 8000; Bright Instruments). For
cytokine measurement, saline-perfused spleen and liver samples were homogenized and processed as described earlier (55).
Measurement of Infarct Size and Neurological Outcome. The size of ischemic
damage was measured as described previously (54) on cresyl violet-stained
brain sections, corrected for edema and expressed as the percentage of the
hemisphere. There were no differences in brain size between groups. Neurological status in mice was assessed according to a neurological grading
score of increasing severity of deficit (56).
Cytokine Measurement. Sample processing and protein determination were
performed as described previously (55). Saline-perfused liver and spleen
homogenates were measured for TNFα, CXCL1, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-1α, and IL-10, using
CBA Flex Sets (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturers’ protocol, on
a BD FACSVerse flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Values are expressed as pg/g
protein, and protein concentration was determined using Pierce BCA assay kit.
Immunofluorescence. Immunostaining was performed as described earlier (10).
In brief, appropriate mixtures of rat anti-mouse CD45 1:200 (Serotec), goat
anti-mouse IL-1α, goat anti-mouse IL-1β 1:100 (R&D Systems), and rabbit anti-

scores were analyzed with nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test followed by

significant.

Quantitative Analysis and Statistics. Animals were randomized for the experiments, and surgeries were performed without the operator being aware of the
genetic condition of the animals. All quantitative analysis was performed under
blinded conditions. Group sizes were determined by power calculation based
on results from our previous MCAo studies (5% confidence level, 80% power,
and an estimated 20–40% SD). Data were analyzed with one-way or two-way

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION

Iba1 1:1,000 (Wako Chemicals) antibodies were used followed by the
appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated Alexa594 or Alexa488 donkey antisera (1:500, Invitrogen). Biotinylated tomato lectin (10 μg/mL, Sigma.) was
visualized with streptavidin–Alexa 350 conjugate (Invitrogen). Activated
(CD45low, Iba1+) and total number of microglia, CD45high leukocytes,
activated blood vessels (based on high levels of tomato lectin staining), and
IL-1α or IL-1β–positive microglia (Iba1+) were counted in the striatum and
cerebral cortex on 3–3 serial sections rostrocaudally (two random 20× fields
per section).
