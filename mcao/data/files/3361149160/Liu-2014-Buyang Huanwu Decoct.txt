Stroke is the major cause of death and the
leading cause of permanent disability in the USA
and in China. Studies have shown that women
have lower risk for ischemic stroke relative to men
before menopause, but women after menopause
have a higher risk of stroke than men (1) and have
greater disability after stroke,(2) and these differences
may be due to endogenous estrogen. (3-5) Animal
studies demonstrated that exogenous estrogens
exert profound protective effects in focal and global
ischemic models.(6,7)
Many Chinese herbal medicine such as
Astragalus membranaceu , and Radix Angelicae
sinensis have estrogenic activities, with
phytoestrogenic-like effects. (8,9) Buyang Huanwu
Decoction (补阳还五汤, BYHWD) is a classic Chinese
medicine widely used for the treatment of stroke
for more than 300 years. It can improve recovery of
neurologic function in stroke patients and rat models
of stroke(10,11) and has been shown to protect injured
neurons, reduce neuronal apoptosis and promote
growth and differentiation of neural progenitor cells
and angiogenesis.(12-15) However, the estrogenic-like
effects of BYHWD on neuronal protection in stroke
have not been reported. Thus, in the present study we
examined the effects of BYHWD on estradiol (E2) and

estradiol receptor (ER) in the rat brain after transient
focal cerebral ischemia.

METHODS
Drugs
BYHWD is composed of Astragalus
membranaceus 120 g, Angelica sinensis 10 g,
Paeonia lactiflora 10 g, Ligusticum chuanxiong 10 g,
Carthamus tinctorius 10 g, Semen Persicae 10 g and
Flos carthami 4.5 g. To ensure the consistency of
the herbal formula, all of the herb components were
purchased from the First Afﬁliated Hospital of Hunan
University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. BYHW
was extracted with standard methods described in
the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (China Pharmacopoeia
and Committee, 2000) and vacuum cool-dried and
made into a drug powder. For use, the powder was

dissolved with distilled water to a final concentration
of 2 g/mL (equivalent to dry weight of raw materials)
and stored at 4 ℃. Estradiol valerate tablets were
purchased from Schering Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.
(Guangzhou, China) and dissolved in sesame oil with
a ﬁnal concentration of 500 μg/mL.(16)

Animals
Adult female Wistar rats weighing 280–300 g
were provided by Hunan Slac Jingda Laboratory Animal
Company, Ltd., Changsha, China. They were housed in
standard conditions. Investigations using experimental
animals were conducted in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. The experimental protocol was approved by
the local ethics committee. The rats were randomized
into six groups by random number table (n =6 per group):
normal, ovariectomy (OVX), middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO), OVX+MCAO, OVX+MCAO+estradiol
(E2), and OVX+MCAO+BYHWD group.

OVX
Female Wistar rats (n =400) were anesthetized
with 400 mg/kg chloral hydrate intraperitoneally.
The ovaries were removed via bilateral abdominal
incisions using aseptic surgical technique and vaginal
smears were checked daily to determine the success
of the model.

Focal Cerebral Ischemia Model
Two weeks after OVX, focal cerebral ischemia
was induced by MCAO, as described previously.(17)
Briefly, 400 rats were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg
chloral hydrate intraperitoneally. The right carotid
bifurcation was exposed, and the external carotid
artery was ligated distal to the bifurcation. A siliconecoated 4–0 nylon monofilament suture was inserted
through an incision of the external cerebral artery and
gently advanced (17–20 mm) to occlude the middle
cerebral artery. After 1 h of ischemia, the filament
was gently withdrawn into the external carotid artery.
Sham-operated rats underwent the same surgical
procedures as their ischemic counterparts but without
the suture-induced occlusion. During the procedures,
the rat rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ℃ by
placing the animals on a heating bed, and 40 rats died
in 1 day after MCAO

Neurologic Examination
The neurological behavior status was carefully

• 783 •

evaluated at 24 h after surgery or 2 h before sacriﬁce
according to Bederson's method. (18) 0 score: no
neurological functional impairment; 1 score: any
part of forepaw flexed (positive for tail suspension
test) without other abnormal signs; 2 scores: lateral
pushing resistance ability decreased (positive for
lateral pushing experiment), accompanied with
forepaw flexion without circling tendency; 3 scores:
same behavior as those for 2 scores, in addition to
spontaneous rotation (circling around paralyzed limbs
during free activity). The higher the score is gotten, the
worse the neurobehavioral dysfunction is appeared,
vice versa. Rats that scored 1–3 at 24 h after surgery
were included in the subsequent experiments.

Drug Administration
Rats in the OVX+MCAO+BYHWD group were
orally gavaged with the BYHWD at a dose of 5 g/kg daily
for 7 consecutive days following MCAO. The dosage
was based on the clinical regimen for adult patients. Rats
in the OVX+MCAO+E2 group were and administrated
estradiol valerate at a dose of 500 μg/(kg•day) for 7
consecutive days following MCAO.(16) The animals in
other groups were given the same volume of distilled
water. All animals were allowed to move and access
food freely.

Infarct Volume Measurement
Rats were killed at 7 days after MCAO under deep
anesthesia then perfused transcardially with ice-cold
saline. Brain slices (2 mm thick) between –2.00 mm and
+4.00 mm from the Bregma were incubated in a 2%
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, sigma) solution
at 37 ℃ for 20 min. Stained slices were photographed
by a digital camera, infarcted (unstained) and uninfarcted
(red color) areas were measured with Olympus
microimage 4.0 software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
The infarct volume was normalized and expressed as a
percentage of the ipsilateral hemispheric volume (%).

E2 Assay
E 2 and ER in serum and brain tissue were
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to
the protocol.

Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows
17.0 Software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago IL, USA). The
results are expressed as mean±standard deviation.

Effect of Neurological Deficits and Infarction
Volume
Neurological deficit scores in the rats is shown
in Figure 1. On day 7, BYHWD and E 2 treatment
significantly reduced the neurological deficit scores,
and there was no signiﬁcantly difference between the
BYHWD and E2 groups. Infarction volume is shown in
Figure 2. There was a significant difference between
the MCAO and OVX+MCAO groups. Rats treated
with E2 and BYHWD showed a reduction in infarction
volume relative to the MCAO group (P <0.05).

concentrations were increased after ovariectomy, but
there were signiﬁcant differences in the BYHWD and

In this study, we showed two major findings.
First, BYHWD improves neurological behavior
performance and reduces the infarction volume after
reversible vascular occlusion of the middle cerebral
artery in ovariectomized female rats. Second,
BYHWD enhances E2 and its receptor in both plasma
but in brain tissue.
Estrogens are a group of pleiotropic sex
hormones and have a secretion pattern in women
that exhibit various biological effects in multiple
physiological systems. (19,20) Estrogens in the brain
were not from circulating estrogen through the
blood-brain barrier but were synthesized in the
brain.(21) In recent years, researchers have become

Chin J Integr Med 2014 Oct;20(10):782-786

interested in the potential neuroprotective effects of
estrogens. Although clinical studies in humans are
currently unclear,(22) numerous animal studies show
estrogen treatment has a neuroprotective effect on
ovariectomized animals following ischemia. The
effects in animals depend on the type of ischemia,
and the dose and timing of estrogen.(6,23,24)
When administered orally, the steroid hormones
undergo a first-pass effect through the liver which
significantly reduces their biologically active
concentrations. However, in agreement with a previous
study,(25) in our present study oral administration of
E2 for 7 consecutive days after occlusion increased
levels estrogen in serum and brain tissue and exerted
neuroprotective effects.

was shown to have phytoestrogenic effects. (33,34)
BYHWD is a famous formula for stroke treatment
in China, and because Astragalus membranaceus
and Angelicae sinensis are the main component of
BYHWD, we hypothesized that estrogenic-like effects
may be a mechanism of BYHWD for stroke treatment.
In the present study, we demonstrated that BYHWD
not only increased levels of E2 in serum and brain
tissue, but also increased levels of ER in brain tissue.
In summary, our study shows that BYHWD
reduces brain ischemic injury and improves neural
function in ovariectomized female rats, and that the
mechanism involves estrogen and its receptor.

As steroid hormones, estrogens readily diffuse
across the cell membrane, and have biological effects
through binding to ERs in the target organ. Two ER
isoforms ERα and ERβ have been identiﬁed, which
are expressed in the ovaries, brain and other tissues.
The effect of estrogen on the brain depends on the
combined nuclear and extranuclear ER concentration.
E2 neuroprotection in the brain is regulated by the
classical nuclear ER-mediated genomic signaling
pathway or nongenomic signaling pathway. (26,27) In
addition, activation of extranuclear estrogen receptors
can reduce ischemic neuronal injury and preserve
cognitive function after global cerebral ischemia.(28)
Our present study shows that estradiol administration
after ovariectomy and ischemia can increase ER
concentration in brain but not in serum after ischemia.

There is currently not enough evidence to
prove that stroke patients can gain benefit from
estrogen therapy. In addition, prolonged estrogen
treatment can increase the incidence of breast cancer,
stroke and cardiovascular disease. Consequently,
phytoestrogens that are naturally derived from
plants and present in the human diet have become
a hotspot of drug research. Phytoestrogens have a
similar molecular structure to mammalian estrogen.
As selective ER modulators, phytoestrogens can
bind to ERs and produce weak estrogenic effects
such as cardioprotective and neuroprotective
activities.(29,30) Many Chinese herbs have estrogenic
activity, for example Astragalus membranaceus
contains phytoestrogen isoflavones which have
neuroprotective potential,(31,32) and Angelicae sinensis
