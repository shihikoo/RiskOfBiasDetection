Stroke is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Few therapeutic options with proven efficacy are available for the
treatment of this disabling disease. Lithium is the gold standard treatment for bipolar disorder. Moreover, lithium has been shown
to exhibit neuroprotective effects and therapeutic efficacy as a treatment of other neurological disorders. This study was undertaken
to examine the effects of lithium on brain inflammatory mediators levels, fever, and mortality in postischemic stroke rats. Ischemic
stroke was induced by occlusion of the mid cerebral artery (MCAO). Pretreatment with a single dose of lithium at 2 hours before
MCAO induction significantly reduced the elevation in interleukin- (IL-) 6 and prostaglandin E2 levels in brain of post-MCAO
rats, as compared to vehicle-treated animals. On the other hand, lithium did not affect the elevation in IL-1ùõº, IL-10, IL-12, and
tumor necrosis factor-ùõº levels in brain of post-MCAO rats. Moreover, pretreatment with lithium did not alter post-MCAO fever
and mortality. These results suggest that acute pretreatment with a single dose of lithium did not markedly affect post-MCAO
morbidity and mortality in rats.

1. Introduction
In 2004 the World Health Organization reported that stroke
was the second cause of death worldwide after ischemic heart
disease [1]. In the United States, stroke was ranked as the
third cause of death after cardiovascular diseases and cancer
[2]. Moreover, cerebrovascular disease was ranked as the first
or second leading cause of burden of disease in the Western
Pacific and European regions, respectively [1]. Those data
clearly indicate that stroke is a very fatal and disabling disease.
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study has
shown that ischemic stroke was the most prevalent (83%) type
of stroke among a cohort of 15792 Americans aged 45‚Äì64
years, followed by intracerebral (10%) and subarachnoid (7%)
hemorrhages [3]. The mechanisms underlying the pathological processes that take place in the brain after the occurrence

of ischemic stroke are very complex. Cerebral ischemia (due
to decreased blood flow to brain tissue) activates an ischemic
cascade which leads to cell death and severe neuronal damage. A large body of evidence suggested that inflammation
plays a pivotal role in the pathological processes in poststroke
brain [4]. Postischemic inflammation involves activation
of glial cells which produce cytotoxic and cytoprotective
mediators [4]. After the occurrence of the ischemic injury,
activated glial cells produce and secrete inflammatory mediators such as interleukin- (IL-) 1ùõº, IL-1ùõΩ, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12,
nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ), and tumor necrosis
factor- (TNF-) ùõº [4‚Äì7]. Moreover, peripherally produced
cytokines and inflammatory mediators produced by brain
infiltrated immune cells also contribute to the postischemic
inflammatory response [4]. Despite the data suggesting that
poststroke inflammation harms infarct zone tissue, it is worth

At 2 h before surgery vehicle-treated rats were injected (ip) with 0.35 mL NaCl 0.9% and LiCl-treated rats with 100 mg/kg lithium. Existence of NDs was assessed
in surviving rats at 24 h after surgery as described in Section 2. Mortality was followed during 24 h after surgery. This table represents the results of the two
experiments conducted in this study. ‚àó Comparisons for statistical significance were done only between groups that underwent the same surgical procedure,

noting that some immune/inflammatory processes enhance
brain recovery and attenuate neuronal damage in postinsult
brain [4]. Thus, inhibition of inflammation does not always
benefit the brain.
Many poststroke patients present with changes in
body temperature (BT), mostly hyperthermia (occasionally
referred to as fever or pyrexia) [8, 9]. Poststroke fever has
been associated with a prominent increase in mortality,
morbidity, and hospital length of stay [8, 9]. For example,
Castillo et al. [8] found that mortality rate was significantly
higher among hyperthermic as compared to normothermic
poststroke patients at 3 months (15.8% versus 1%, resp., ùëÉ <
0.001). In addition, they observed that hyperthermia during
the first 24 hours after stroke onset was independently and
significantly associated with larger infarct volume, higher
neurological deficit, and dependency at 3 months after stroke
[8].
The pharmacotherapy of stroke includes few agents with
proven efficacy [10] underscoring the need for novel efficacious treatments. Lithium is a monovalent cation widely and
effectively used in the treatment of bipolar affective disorder
[11]. Moreover, lithium has been shown to confer potent
neuroprotective effects in various experimental models [12,
13]. Lithium also exerts multiple effects on immune and
inflammatory processes in the brain including some potent
anti-inflammatory properties [14]. As mentioned, inflammation contributes to the neuronal damage which occurs in
poststroke brain. Therefore, the primary objective of this
study was to examine the effects of acute lithium treatment
on levels of inflammatory mediators in brain of poststroke
rats. In addition, we aimed to determine the effects of lithium
on poststroke fever and mortality.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals. Male Wistar rats were used throughout the
studies (Table 1). The animals were housed 3 per cage
and maintained under controlled environmental conditions
(ambient temperature 22 ¬± 1‚àò C, relative humidity 55‚Äì58%,
and photoperiod cycle 12 h light : 12 h dark), fed Purina Lab
Chow and water ad libitum. Only animals with no overt
pathology were included in the studies. The procedures of
the study were in accordance with the Guidelines of the
Committee for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals in
Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel.

2.2. Lithium Treatment. Lithium chloride (LiCl, purchased
from Sigma) was dissolved in NaCl 0.9% and filtered to
produce a sterile solution. Rats were treated with a single
intraperitoneal (ip) injection of LiCl 100 mg/kg at 2 h before
induction of anesthesia. Alternatively, control animals were
treated with vehicle (0.35 mL sterile NaCl 0.9%, ip).
2.3. Surgical Procedure. Permanent mid cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) was performed according to the method
of Longa et al. [15] with slight modifications as described
previously [16]. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with ketamine
75 mg/kg and midazolam 3 mg/kg (both given ip). Anesthetized rats were subjected to the surgical procedure which
lasted 25‚Äì30 min during which they were allowed to breathe
spontaneously. The right common carotid artery (CCA)
was exposed through a middle neck incision and carefully
dissected from surrounding tissues from its bifurcation to the
base of the skull. The occipital artery branches of the external
carotid artery (ECA) were then isolated, dissected, and
coagulated. The ECA was further dissected distally and coagulated along with the terminal lingual and maxillary artery
branches. The internal carotid artery (ICA) was isolated and
carefully separated from the adjacent vagus nerve and the
pterygopalatine artery was ligated close to its origin with a
4-0 silk suture. Then, the MCA was blocked by inserting
a 3.5 cm length of a 4-0 nylon silicon-coated filament 18‚Äì
18.5 mm before the bifurcation of the CCA and then into the
circle of Willis, effectively occluding the MCA (a procedure
hereafter referred to as MCAO). The ICA and CCA were
temporarily blocked. Subsequently, a 4-0 silk suture was tied
loosely around the CCA before its bifurcation. The silk suture
around the CCA stump was fastened around the intraluminal
filament to prevent bleeding. The filament was then fixed by
tying up a silk suture over the CCA. The suture was left in
place permanently. Sham-operated (control) rats were anesthetized and subjected only to a middle neck skin incision.
2.4. Measurement of Body Temperature. BT was measured
with a plastic-coated thermocouple probe (HL 600 Thermometer, Anristu Meter Co., Japan) inserted into the rectum.
Measurement was performed at 2 h after surgery in both
sham- and MCAO-operated rats.
2.5. Assessment of Postsurgical Neurological Deficit and Mortality. In order to verify the correctness of the MCAO

2.6. Preparation of Brain Homogenates. At 24 h after the
MCAO procedure surviving rats were anesthetized briefly
(with a mixture of 4% isoflurane in 100% oxygen) and
immediately sacrificed by decapitation. Brains were quickly
extracted and washed in ice-cold saline 0.9%. Frontal cortex
(FC), hypothalamus (HT), and hippocampus (HC) were
gently excised on ice, cleaned, and immediately transferred to
‚Äì80‚àò C. Then, each sample was weighed and manually homogenized for 10 seconds in 500 ùúáL of a cold phosphate-buffered
saline solution containing protease inhibitors (homogenizing
buffer). Subsequently, tissue homogenates were centrifuged at
10,000 rpm, 4‚àò C for 10 min. Supernatants were collected and
immediately transferred to ‚Äì80‚àò C for further determination.
2.7. Determination of PGE2 and Cytokines Levels. Samples
(supernatants) were assayed for PGE2 protein content using
an ELISA kit according to manufacturer‚Äôs instructions (R&D
Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA). Levels of IL-1ùõº, IL-6, IL10, IL-12, and TNF-ùõº were determined by a multiplexed
ELISA array (Quansys Biosciences; Logan, Utah, USA).
This assay allows measuring the concentration of multiple
inflammatory-associated mediators in a single sample. In
both assays, when the level of the detected mediator was
below the lower detection limit, results were annotated as
‚Äúbelow detection limit‚Äù and assigned a result of zero.
2.8. Statistical Analysis and Presentation of the Data. We
performed two independent experiments. The number of rats
in each group in the first experiment, second experiment,
and total count was as follows, respectively: sham + vehicle‚Äî
3, 6, and 9; sham + LiCl‚Äî3, 6, and 9; MCAO + vehicle‚Äî
12, 17, and 29; MCAO + LiCl‚Äî11, 17, and 28. Statistical
evaluations were carried out using Student‚Äôs t-test (twotailed) or chi-square Fisher exact test, according to type of the
tested parameter. Normally distributed data and continuous
variables are presented as mean ¬± SEM. Values of ùëÉ <
0.05 were considered statistically significant. It is worth
noting that all brain samples were homogenized in 500 ùúáL

procedure animals were tested for existence of a neurological
deficit (ND) [16]. Two observers who were blind to type of
the surgical procedure performed examined each animal for
visible NDs. Any of the following features was regarded as a
ND: forelimb flexion; contralateral forelimb gripping weakly
(the operator placed the rat on an absorbent pad and gently
pulled the tail); circling to the paretic side only when pulled
by the tail (the rat was allowed to move freely on the absorbent
pad); spontaneous circling. Rats in the MCAO group needed
to present at least one of the ND features above in order to
be included in this group (Table 1). Rats in the sham group
needed to present no visible NDs in order to be included
in this group (were excluded if they presented any visible
ND). Moreover, we assessed mortality during 24 h following
the surgical procedure. The rate of mortality was compared
between rats of the same surgical procedure; namely, sham
+ vehicle group was compared to sham + LiCl group and
MCAO + vehicle group was compared to MCAO + LiCl
group (Table 1).

of homogenizing buffer regardless of their weight. Thus, the
content of inflammatory mediators in resultant homogenates
was lower than their actual content in the original tissue
(taking into account that, e.g., the average weight of HT
samples was 41 mg while the average weight of FC samples
was 45 mg). Results in figures of IL-1ùõº, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12,
PGE2 , and TNF-ùõº were calculated as follows: ELISA result
(pg/mL) divided by sample weight in milligrams. Results are
presented as pg/mL (pg/mg wet weight).

3. Results
3.1. Effects of Acute Lithium Treatment on Body Temperature
of Poststroke Rats. Before surgery, BT did not significantly
differ between all treatment groups (data not shown). As
compared to sham-operated rats, MCAO-operated rats had
a significantly higher BT at 2 h after surgery (Figure 1).
Pretreatment with lithium did not alter BT either in shamoperated or in MCAO-operated rats (Figure 1).
3.2. Effects of Acute Lithium Treatment on Mortality of
Poststroke Rats. At 24 h after surgery all sham-operated rats
survived and exhibited no visible NDs (Table 1). On the other
hand, all rats that underwent MCAO surgery and survived
had visible NDs (Table 1). Mortality was followed during 24 h
after surgery. Animals that died during the surgical procedure
were not counted as part of the MCAO groups. Out of 60 rats
that underwent MCAO surgery in the two experiments of the
study, 3 died during the surgical procedure (5% perioperative
mortality). Thus, mortality was assessed in the remaining 57
MCAO rats. Eight out of 29 vehicle-treated MCAO rats died

4
during 24 h after surgery (27.6% mortality, Table 1). Seven
out of 28 lithium-treated MCAO rats died during 24 h after
surgery (25% mortality, Table 1). These results indicate that
acute pretreatment with lithium did not significantly (ùëÉ =
0.532) reduce the rate of poststroke mortality.
3.3. Effects of Acute Lithium Treatment on Brain Inflammatory
Mediators Levels of Poststroke Rats. As compared to shamoperated rats, levels of IL-1ùõº, IL-6 (except in HT), IL-10, IL12 (except in HT), and TNF-ùõº were significantly higher in
brain regions of MCAO-operated rats (Figures 2(a), 2(b),
2(c), 2(d), and 2(e), resp.). Pretreatment with lithium did
not alter the levels of IL-1ùõº, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-ùõº either
in sham-operated or in MCAO-operated rats (Figures 2(a),
2(c), 2(d), and 2(e)). On the other hand, pretreatment with
lithium significantly reduced IL-6 levels in all brain regions
in MCAO-operated rats (Figure 2(b)). Moreover, PGE2 levels
were similar in brain regions of sham- and MCAO-operated
rats (Figure 2(f)). Surprisingly, pretreatment with lithium
significantly reduced PGE2 levels in HC and HT of MCAOoperated but not in sham-operated rats (Figure 2(f)).

4. Discussion
The present study demonstrated that acute pretreatment with
lithium did not prominently alter brain inflammation in
post-MCAO rats. Lithium significantly reduced levels of IL6 in FC, HC, and HT and PGE2 in HC and HT in postMCAO rats. However, it did not influence the elevation in
IL-1ùõº, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-ùõº levels in post-MCAO rats.
In addition, under the experimental conditions used in this
study, pretreatment with lithium did not alter post-MCAO
fever and mortality.
Lithium is the gold standard pharmacotherapy of bipolar
disorder [12]. Lithium was also shown to exert therapeutic
benefits in the treatment of other neurological disorders
including Alzheimer‚Äôs disease [17] and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis [18]. The pathophysiology of stroke comprises a
prominent inflammatory response, particularly in the postischemic zone. The ischemic cascade leads to dysregulation
of brain function and homeostasis due a profound oxidative
stress and prominent subsequent inflammation, both of
which lead to cell death and aggravation of tissue damage [4].
Moreover, lithium was found to exert anti-inflammatory [14]
and neuroprotective [12, 13] effects under various experimental conditions. Therefore, we hypothesized that lithium may
possess anti-inflammatory effects in poststroke rats. Under
the experimental conditions used in the present study lithium
reduced the levels of IL-6 and PGE2 but did not affect the
levels of IL-1ùõº, IL-10, and IL-12 in poststroke rats (Figure 2).
PGE2 is an important mediator of tissue homeostasis
and alteration of its level/function may lead to deleterious
pathological processes [19]. A large body of evidence associated PGE2 with inflammatory conditions and pathological
changes in BT. For example, PGE2 was shown to contribute
to the pathogenesis of lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced
hypothermia and fever in rats [20]. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen

BioMed Research International
inhibit the production of PGE2 and are widely used as
antipyretic medications [19]. Chronic lithium treatment was
found to reduce brain levels of PGE2 in rats [21]. Moreover,
we showed that acute pretreatment with lithium significantly
decreased hypothalamic PGE2 levels in LPS-treated rats,
which was accompanied by a significant attenuation of LPSinduced hypothermia [20]. Importantly, permanent MCAO
was associated with a significant hyperthermia and increased
hypothalamic damage in rats [22]. In the present study we
examined the effect of acute pretreatment with lithium on
poststroke fever. We found that MCAO-operated animals had
a significantly higher BT than sham-operated rats at 2 h after
surgery (Figure 1). Lithium did not influence the fever in
MCAO-operated rats (Figure 1), despite a significant reduction in hypothalamic PGE2 levels (Figure 2). Surprisingly,
HT PGE2 levels did not differ between MCAO-operated
and sham-operated animals (Figure 2), despite the reported
damage to the hypothalamus in post-MCAO-operated rats
[22]. These findings hint at a possibility that PGE2 does not
play a central role in the mechanism of poststroke fever.
Consistent with this assumption, Legos et al. [23] found
that aspirin, a NSAID which inhibits PGE2 production, did
not attenuate hyperthermia in MCAO-operated rats at 2 h
after surgery. It is reasonable to assume that poststroke fever
results (at least in part) from and is associated with the
tissue damage in the ischemic zone. The dissemination of
cell debris and burst of excitatory neurotransmitters (such
as glutamate) secretion contribute to the development of
poststroke fever [24], which does not necessarily respond to
systemic administration of NSAIDs [24].
IL-1ùõº is usually regarded as a proinflammatory cytokine
[25]. Under resting conditions IL-1ùõº constitutively presents
at low levels in multiple cell types; however, following tissue
damage, cell death, or hypoxia, its expression is greatly
induced and it is produced by a number of cells such
as macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells [25]. IL1ùõº facilitates the recruitment of immune cells and induces
the secretion of mainly proinflammatory cytokines such as
IL-1ùõΩ and TNF-ùõº [25]. Several studies have associated IL1ùõº with the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke [26]. For
example, Luheshi et al. [26] reported that IL-1ùõº production
is upregulated early after the occurrence of ischemic stroke
in mice, leading to induction of proinflammatory cytokines
secretion and aggravation of inflammation in the ischemicinjured zone. In the present study we found that IL-1ùõº levels
were significantly increased in FC, HC, and HT of MCAOoperated rats (Figure 2). Pretreatment with lithium did not
affect the elevation in IL-1ùõº.
IL-6 acts mostly as a proinflammatory cytokine but it also
exerts some anti-inflammatory properties [27]. It is produced
by T cells, macrophages, and other cells in response to
immune activation due to infection or tissue damage. IL-6 has
been associated with pathological conditions such as arthritis,
autoimmune and inflammatory responses, and cancer [27].
IL-6 is also involved in the regulation of metabolic, regenerative, and neuronal processes [27]. Elevated plasma and
CSF levels of IL-6 were associated with increased neurological
worsening in patients with ischemic stroke [11]. In the present
study, IL-6 levels were significantly increased in FC and HT

of MCAO-operated rats. Pretreatment with lithium significantly reduced IL-6 levels in FC and HT (Figure 2), pointing
to a possible anti-inflammatory effect of the drug in these
brain regions. Surprisingly, lithium did not alter IL-6 levels
in HC of sham-operated rats but totally abolished its levels
in MCAO-operated rats. The reason for this discrepancy is
currently not understood.
IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine which inhibits
the activity of proinflammatory cytokines and suppresses
the expression of their receptors [28]. It is secreted under
different conditions of immune activation by a variety of
cells including T and B cells, monocytes, macrophages,
and glial cells. IL-10 suppresses inflammatory responses and
plays a role in maintaining homeostasis of overall immune
responses, including during conditions of neuroinflammation [28]. Tarkowski et al. [5] found that IL-10 levels were
increased in CSF of stroke patients. Decreased plasma levels
of IL-10 were associated with increased neurological worsening in patients with ischemic stroke [29]. Moreover, IL-10producing T cells were found to play a role in reducing infarct
size volume in post-MCAO mice [7]. In the present study, IL10 levels were significantly increased in FC, HC, and HT of
MCAO-operated rats (Figure 2). Pretreatment with lithium
did not alter IL-10 levels in those brain regions.
The IL-12 family of cytokines comprises a number of
members including IL-12, IL-23, IL-27, and IL-35 [30]. IL12 is composed of two subunits, p35 and p40, which bind
to and activate IL-12 receptors. IL-23 and IL-35 are also
composed of 2 subunits (heterodimers) in which p40 and p35,
respectively, also activate IL-12 receptors [30]. The regulation
of the inflammatory response by these cytokines is influenced
by the identity of the subunits composing the cytokine heterodimer. For example, IL-23 and IL-12 are proinflammatory
cytokines while IL-35 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine. A
number of studies addressed the association between IL12 and ischemic stroke. For example, Konoeda et al. [31]
found that treatment with an anti-p40 monoclonal antibody
(which blocks the activity of IL-12 and IL-23) decreased
ischemia/reperfusion injury and enhanced recovery of neurological deficits in mice. Moreover, Narasimhalu et al. [32]
reported that increased serum level of IL-12 was associated
with a cognitive decline in postischemic stroke patients. In
the present study IL-12 levels were significantly increased in
FC and HT of MCAO-operated rats, which was not affected
by pretreatment with lithium (Figure 2).
TNF-ùõº is an important multifunctional proinflammatory
cytokine secreted from various immune and glial cells [33].
It stimulates numerous immune/inflammatory responses
and regulates various physiological as well as pathological
processes in humans. TNF-ùõº has been associated with the
pathophysiology of many neurological illnesses including
psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders [5, 33, 34]. For
example, a comprehensive meta-analysis of 30 studies has
demonstrated that plasma levels of TNF-ùõº are increased in
bipolar patients as compared to control subjects [34]. Importantly, it was found that TNF-ùõº levels are increased in CSF
of stroke patients [5]. Lithium was shown to decrease TNF-ùõº
levels under multiple experimental conditions; however, several contradicting findings have also been reported (reviewed

in [14]). In the present study TNF-ùõº levels were significantly
increased in FC, HC, and HT of MCAO-operated rats, which
was not affected by pretreatment with lithium (Figure 2).
Relying on evidence attesting for the involvement of
inflammation in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying ischemic stroke, several studies have examined the therapeutic potential of different anti-inflammatory strategies as
a treatment for ischemic stroke. For example, Caso et al.
[35] examined the effect of deleting (knocking out) toll-like
receptor- (TLR-) 4 in post-MCAO mice. As compared to their
respective controls, TLR4-deficient mice had a diminished
brain inflammatory response which was accompanied by
a significant decrease in infarct volume and neurological and behavioral alterations [35]. Similarly, Zhou et al.
[36] reported that MCAO resulted in a significant cerebral
infarction and increased neurological deficit scores in rats.
Treatment with propofol (an anesthetic drug which confers
anti-inflammatory properties) significantly reduced infarct
volume and improved neurological function in MCAOoperated rats [36].
A number of experimental studies have investigated the
utility of lithium as a treatment for ischemic stroke suggesting
that it has potent therapeutic benefits. For example, Nonaka
and Chuang [37] found that chronic treatment with lithium
(subcutaneously for 16 days) significantly reduced infarct
volume and neurological deficits in post-MCAO rats. Similarly, Xu et al. [13] demonstrated that chronic subcutaneous
treatment with lithium for 16 days significantly decreased
infarct volume and neurological deficits in post-MCAO rats.
Moreover, Sheng et al. [38] reported that a single intravenous
injection with lithium led to a significant reduction in
infarct volume and neurological deficits in post-MCAO rats.
Interestingly, this study showed that a combinatory treatment
with lithium + PGE1 resulted in greater neuroprotection
than treatment with each agent alone [38]. Despite the
encouraging results obtained in the cited animal studies, a
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial in
stroke patients revealed that treatment with lithium for 30
days did not significantly improve patients‚Äô motor recovery
[39]. Patients were randomly assigned to receive lithium (ùëõ =
32) or placebo (ùëõ = 34) during the first 48 hours after stroke
onset and treatment was continued for 30 days. Improvement
measures did not differ significantly between the groups.
However, in a subgroup of patients with cortical stroke
lithium resulted in a significant improvement in motor activity. The authors suggested that cortical stroke patients may
particularly benefit from lithium treatment and advocated
conduction of a larger sample size trial to test this assumption
[39]. In the present study lithium treatment did not decrease
NDs and mortality in MCAO-operated rats. The reason for
the discrepancy between the results (positive) of previous
animals studies [13, 37, 38] and those of the present study is
not clear. A possible reason could be that our study utilized an
acute lithium treatment regimen (single dose, ip) while most
of the previous studies used a chronic treatment protocol. We
speculated that administering lithium acutely at 2 h before
induction of MCAO would be sufficient to inhibit the major
enzymes that are regarded as therapeutic targets of the
drug (e.g., inositol monophosphatase and glycogen synthase

kinase-3). Indeed, treatment with lithium in vitro inhibits
inositol monophosphatase and glycogen synthase kinase-3
within minutes after exposure to the drug. Nevertheless, it
is still possible that a chronic lithium treatment produces a
prominent and long-lasting cellular impact which results in a
more profound protective effect against the deleterious results
of the ischemic damage.
Our study had some limitations. One limitation was
that we measured BT only at 2 h after MCAO. The main
reason for this was that mortality occurred as early as 4
hours after (MCAO) surgery. Another limitation was that we
administered lithium prophylactically before MCAO surgery.
Although stroke has several known risk factors, in clinical reality, the exact time for the occurrence of stroke is
largely unpredictable. Thus, it could be argued that a more
appropriate experimental design would be to examine the
efficacy of lithium treatment after the occurrence of stroke.
Nevertheless, we believe that examining the prophylactic use
of lithium (or another drug) as a possible treatment against
stroke is worth testing and has scientific merit.
In summary, the present study shows that lithium exhibited some anti-inflammatory properties but did not affect
hyperthermia, neurological deficits, and mortality in poststroke rats.
