Abstract. Probucol, a lipid-lowering agent with anti-oxidant
properties, is involved in protection against atherosclerosis, while cilostazol, an antiplatelet agent, has diverse
neuroprotective properties. In this study, we investigated
the anti-inflammatory effects of probucol and cilostazol
on focal cerebral ischemia with hypercholesterolemia.
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout (KO) mice were fed a
high-fat diet (HFD) with or without 0.3% probucol and/or
0.2% cilostazol for 10 weeks. To assess the protective effects
of the combined therapy of probucol and cilostazol on ischemic injury, the mice received 40 min of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO). Infarct volumes, neurobehavioral
deficits and neuroinflammatory mediators were subsequently
evaluated 48 h after reperfusion. Probucol alone and probucol
plus cilostazol significantly decreased total- and low-density
lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in ApoE KO with HFD. MCAO
resulted in significantly larger infarct volumes in ApoE KO
mice provided with HFD compared to those fed a regular
diet, although these volumes were significantly reduced in
the probucol plus cilostazol group. Consistent with a smaller
infarct size, probucol alone and the combined treatment of
probucol and cilostazol improved neurological and motor function. In addition, probucol alone and probucol plus cilostazol
decreased MCP-1 expression and CD11b and GFAP immuno­
reactivity in the ischemic cortex. These findings suggested
that the inhibitory effects of probucol plus cilostazol in MCP-1
expression in the ischemic brain with hypercholesterolemia
allowed the identification of one of the mechanisms responsible for anti-inflammatory action. Probucol plus cilostazol

may therefore serve as a therapeutic strategy for reducing the
impact of stroke in hypercholesterolemic subjects.
Introduction
Hypercholesterolemia is a major underlying cause of ischemic
stroke (1) and therapeutics targeting hypercholesterolemia
decrease the risk of stroke in high-risk individuals. Chronic
systemic inflammatory conditions, such as atherosclerosis,
diabetes and obesity are associated with increased risk of
stroke (2,3). Stroke is also characterized by massive inflammation in areas surrounding the injury that magnifies damage
to the brain (4). Therefore, modulation of inflammation may
be an effective therapeutic strategy for reducing the impact of
stroke in hypercholesterolemic subjects.
Probucol is a cholesterol‑lowering drug with antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerogenic properties (5).
Cilostazol is a type 3 phosphodiesterase inhibitor that exhibits
antiplatelet and vasodilating activity by suppressing the
degradation of cAMP (6). Cilostazol has also been shown to
exert in vivo neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic
injury via anti-inflammatory effects (7). A previous in vitro
study using cultured human coronary artery endothelial
cells (8), as well as in vivo studies in rats, low‑density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor‑deficient mice and apolipoprotein
E (ApoE) knockout (KO) mice revealed the synergistic effects
of probucol plus cilostazol against atherosclerotic lesions
and ischemic brain injury (9-11). The aforementioned studies
suggested that combined administration of these drugs may
result in synergistic effects in mice with stroke and hypercholesterolemia. In addition, probucol and cilostazol have
anti-inflammatory effects and may act synergistically to accelerate the outcome process via the inhibition of inflammation.
Chemokines, which are well-known regulators of
peripheral immune cell recruitment and trafficking under
physiological and pathological conditions, can cause
secondary damage during inflammation and affect cerebral
ischemia. MCP-1, a pro-inflammatory chemokine, is a potent
chemoattractant capable of promoting monocyte recruitment
into an inflammatory or pathological site. Once activated near

688

the site of pathology, the recruited cells can produce more
pro-inflammatory mediators, inducing inflammation (12,13).
Therefore, understanding the modulation of chemokines may
result in the development of treatments specific for cerebral
ischemia with hypercholesterolemia.
In the present study, we investigated whether hypercholesterolemia exacerbates ischemic outcomes and any
exacerbation of stroke was associated with neuroinflammation
in the brain by coupling hypercholesterolemia in an experimental stroke model using mice. In addition, we focused on
the effect of probucol and cilostazol administered in combination with conventional therapy due to their anti-inflammatory
properties. The tissue outcome and functional outcome were
determined following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in ApoE KO mice fed the high-fat diet (HFD)
for 10 weeks using combinatorial treatment of probucol plus
cilostazol. Microglia and astrocyte activation in accordance
with chemokine levels were determined to be the action mechanisms. The current study presented evidence with regard to
the anti-inflammatory effects of combinatorial therapy with
probucol and cilostazol during the management of stroke
patients undergoing hypercholesterolemia.
Materials and methods
General surgical preparation. Male ApoE KO mice (Japan
SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) with a C57BL/6J genetic background
were housed under diurnal lighting conditions and allowed
food and tap water ad libitum. The study was carried out in
strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National
Institutes of Health. In addition, the protocol was approved by
the Pusan National University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (permit no.: PNU-2011-000419). Four‑week-old
ApoE KO mice were fed a Western-type HFD (42% of total
calories from fat, 0.15% cholesterol; Research Diets, Inc.,
New Brunswick, NJ, USA) containing 0.3% (wt/wt) probucol,
0.2% (wt/wt) cilostazol, or 0.3% (wt/wt) probucol and
0.2% (wt/wt) cilostazol for 10 weeks. Anesthesia was achieved
by isoflurane (2% induction and 1.5% maintenance, in 80% N2O
and 20% O2) administered via a face mask. The femoral artery
was catheterized for measurement of the mean arterial blood
pressure using a model MLT844 physiological pressure transducer (AD Instruments, Medford, MA, USA). The data were
continuously recorded using a Power Lab data acquisition and
analysis system (AD Instruments) and stored in a computer.
The depth of anesthesia was checked by the absence of cardiovascular changes in response to tail pinch. Rectal temperature
was kept at 36.5‑37.5˚C using a PanlabTM thermostatically
controlled heating mat (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA,
USA). Arterial blood gases and pH were measured prior to
ischemia using i-Stat System (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA).
Focal cerebral ischemia. A fiber-optic probe was affixed to the
skull over the MCA for measurement of the regional CBF (rCBF)
by a PeriFlux Laser Doppler System 5000 (Perimed, Stockholm,
Sweden). Baseline values were measured prior to internal
carotid artery ligation (considered to be 100% flow). Focal
cerebral ischemia was induced by occluding the MCA using
a previously described intraluminal filament technique (14).

MCAO was induced by a silicon‑coated 7-0 monofilament in
the internal carotid artery and the monofilament was advanced
to occlude the MCA. In all the animals, rCBF was measured
to confirm the achievement of consistent and similar levels
of ischemic induction. The filament was withdrawn 40 min
after occlusion and reperfusion was confirmed using laser
Doppler. The surgical wound was sutured and mice were
allowed to recover from anesthesia. The brains were removed
at 48 h after MCAO. Cerebral infarct size was determined on
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)‑stained, 2-mm-thick
brain sections (n=10-11). Infarction areas were quantified with
iSolution full image analysis software (Image & Microscope
Technology, Vancouver, BC, Canada). To account for and
eliminate the effects of swelling/edema, infarction volume was
calculated by indirect measurement by summing the volumes
of each section according to the formula: contralateral hemisphere (mm3) - undamaged ipsilate­ral hemisphere (mm3) (15).
Neurological score. Neurological deficit was scored in each
mouse at 24 and 48 h after ischemic insult in a blinded manner
according to the following graded scoring system (n=12-14):
0, no deficit; 1, forelimb weakness and torso turning to the
ipsilateral side when held by tail; 2, circling to the affected
side; 3, unable to bear weight on the affected side; and 4, no
spontaneous locomotor activity or barrel rolling (16).
Wire-grip test. Vestibule-motor function was assessed using a
wire-grip test 24 and 48 h after cerebral ischemia (17) (n=12-14).
Briefly, mice were placed on a metal wire (45 cm long) suspended
45 cm above protective padding and allowed to traverse the
wire for 60 sec. The latency for which a mouse remained on
the wire within a 60-sec interval was measured, and the wire
grip score was quantified using the following 5-point scale:
unable to remain on the wire for 30 sec, 0; failure to hold on to
the wire with both sets of fore paws and hind paws together, 1;
holding on to the wire with both forepaws and hind paws but not
the tail, 2; holding on to the wire using the tail along with both
forepaws and both hind paws, 3; moving along the wire on all
four paws plus tail, 4; a score of 4 points in addition to the mouse
ambulating down one of the posts used to support the wire, 5.
Tests were administered in triplicate and the average value was
calculated for each mouse on each test day.
Cylinder test. The cylinder test was modified for mice in
order to determine forelimb use and rotation asymmetry (18)
(n=12-14). Briefly, the mouse was placed in a transparent
cylinder (diameter, 9-cm and height, 15  cm). After the
mouse was placed into the cylinder, forelimb use of the first
contact against the wall following rearing and during lateral
exploration was recorded. The final score was calculated as:
(non‑impaired forelimb movement - impaired forelimb movement)/(non‑impaired forelimb movement + impaired forelimb
movement + both movement). This test evaluates forelimb use
asymmetry for weight shifting during vertical exploration and
provides high inter-rater reliability, even when inexperienced
raters are included.
Isolation of total RNA and RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated
from the ischemic area in the brain using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's

mGAPDH (forward 5'-ATGACCACAGTCCATGCCATCA-3'
and reverse 5'-TTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAG‑3'). Products
were size-separated by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and
visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. Thermal
cycling conditions consisted of 94˚C for 5 min and 30 cycles of
94˚C for 30 sec, 55˚C for 30 sec and 72˚C for 30 sec.
Immunohistochemistry. Forty‑eight hours after MCAO, the
mice were deeply anesthetized with thiopental sodium and
subsequently perfused transcardially with cold phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), after which they were perfused for
fixing using 4% paraformaldehyde (n=3). The brain of each
mouse was then removed and fixed for 48 h in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4˚C. Subsequently, it was subjected to cryoprotection
in 30% sucrose for 24 h at 4˚C. The isolated brains were then
frozen and stored at -80˚C until further processing. The frozen
brains were cut into sections (14 µm) using a model CM 3050
cryostat (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). The
sections were immunostained with antibodies against MCP-1
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK), CD11b (Serotec, Oxford, UK) and
GFAP (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). After additional incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody, the samples were
incubated in ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,

CA, USA). Reactions were visualized by development in
3,3'‑diaminobenzidine substrates (Vector Laboratories). The
samples were then visualized using a light microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Jena, Germany).
Drugs. Probucol [4,4'-(isopropylidenedithio)bis(2,6-di-t-butylophenol)] and cilostazol [OPC-13013, 6-[4-(1-cycl ohexyl‑1H
-tetrazol-5-yl) butoxy]-3,4-dihydro-2-(1H)-quinolinone] were
donated by Otsuka Pharmaceutical (Tokushima, Japan) and
were added to the HFD.
Data analysis. Data are expressed as the means ± standard
error of the mean (SEM). The control vs. vehicle group
and vehicle vs. probucol‑treated group were compared by
the unpaired t-test, while vehicle vs. each concentration
of probucol was compared by one-way ANOVA followed
by Dunnett's test. Differences were considered statistically significant, when the two-tailed P-values were <0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS software
(SAS Institute Japan, R9.1).
Results
Physiological parameters. The body weights of ApoE KO
mice fed a HFD for 10 weeks were higher than those of mice
fed a normal diet (control) (32.71±1.05 vs.  25.90±0.73  g,
respectively, P<0.01; n=15-16). Treatment with 0.3% probucol
and 0.2% cilostazol did not affect the body weight or blood
pressure of HFD-fed mice (Table I). After 10 weeks of HFD,
large increases in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol plasma
were observed in ApoE KO mice (P<0.01 vs. control) (Table I).
Probucol alone and probucol plus cilostazol in combination
led to a significant decrease in the total- and LDL-cholesterol
levels in ApoE KO mice fed the HFD (P<0.01 vs. vehicle).
Effect of probucol plus cilostazol in combination on tissue and
functional outcome in focal cerebral ischemia. To determine
whether probucol plus cilostazol improved the tissue outcome
after cerebral ischemia in hypercholesterolemic mice, the
infarct size was measured 48 h after a 40-min transient

MCAO. MCAO resulted in 137% larger infarct volumes in
ApoE KO fed the HFD for 10 weeks when compared to those
fed the regular diet (47.66±10.15 mm3 vs. 20.13±4.76 mm3;
P<0.05) (Fig. 1A and B); however, this increase was significantly reduced by treatment with probucol plus cilostazol
(20.90±3.71 mm3; P<0.05 vs. vehicle group). The group that
received probucol alone also tended to have a smaller infarct
volume (22.79±3.93 mm 3; P= 0.055 vs.  vehicle group). To
assess the effects of probucol plus cilostazol on functional
recovery after cerebral ischemia in hypercholesterolemic mice,
the neurological score, wire-grip test and cylinder test were
assessed 24 and 48 h after a 40-min transient MCA occlusion. Consistent with a smaller infarct size, probucol alone and
combined treatment with cilostazol led to prominent improvement of neurological and motor function at both 24 and 48 h
after ischemic injury (Figs. 1C and 2).
Effect of probucol plus cilostazol in combination on inflammatory mediator mRNA levels in the ischemic brain. To examine
the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of probucol plus cilostazol
on focal cerebral ischemia with hypercholesterolemia, we
assessed the mRNA levels of MCP-1, VCAM, iNOS, COX-2,
TNF-α and IL-1β in the ischemic brain. MCP-1, iNOS, TNF-α
and IL-1β mRNA levels were increased in the ischemic brain
of hypercholesterolemic mice, but VCAM and COX-2 mRNA

levels were not increased. Moreover, this increase of MCP-1
and TNF-α mRNA was significantly decreased by probucol
plus cilostazol in combination compared with the vehicle
group (Fig. 3).
Effect of probucol plus cilostazol in combination on MCP-1,
CD11b and GFAP expression in the ischemic cortex. MCP-1
expression in the ischemic brain was assessed by immunohistochemistry. MCP-1 expression increased in the ischemic brain of
hypercholesterolemic mice, which was decreased by probucol
alone, cilostazol alone or probucol plus cilostazol (Fig. 4A).
CD11b (also known as αmβ2 integrin and Mac1) and GFAP
are sensitive markers of microglial and astrocyte activation,
respectively. CD11b immunoreactivity was increased in the
vehicle group, but this increase was attenuated by probucol
alone and probucol plus cilostazol (Fig. 4B). Immunostaining
of GFAP was evident in the ischemic brain of the control and
hypercholesterolemic mice and mild GFAP immunostaining
appeared in mice that received probucol alone, cilostazol
alone and probucol plus cilostazol (Fig. 4C).
Discussion
The present study was conducted to elucidate the protective
effects of probucol plus cilostazol in combination against

cerebral ischemic injury with hypercholesterolemia and the
mechanism by which these effects occur. MCAO (40 min)
and reperfusion (48 h) resulted in significantly larger infarct
volumes in ApoE KO mice fed HFD for 10 weeks when
compared to ApoE KO mice fed a regular diet, although these
increased volumes were significantly reduced in the probucol
plus cilostazol group. Consistent with the smaller infarct size,
probucol alone and combined treatment with cilostazol greatly
improved the neurological and motor function. In addition,
probucol alone and probucol and cilostazol in combination
decreased MCP-1 mRNA expression, as well as MCP-1, CD11b
and GFAP immunoreactivity in the ischemic cortex. These
findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of probucol and
cilostazol in combination through an inflammatory mediator,
MCP-1 expression, in the ischemic brain with hypercholesterolemia allowed the identification of one of the mechanisms
responsible for its anti-inflammatory action.
The lack of successful translation from the laboratory to
clinical settings may be the result of prevailing clinical conditions, such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and insulin
intolerance, which are correlated with a higher incidence of

stroke (2,19,20), which are not included in animal models
used in the study of stroke. Animal stroke studies conducted
using mostly young animals without risk factors (21) do
not accuratley reflect the pathophysiological conditions in
humans. The ApoE KO mouse model is the classical model of
atherosclerosis. These mice start to develop severe hypercholesterolemia, induce inflammation and atherosclerotic lesions
in the aorta and pulmonary, coronary and carotid arteries
at the age of 8 or 10 weeks, depending on the type of diet
administered (22). By coupling hypercholesterolemia in an
experimental mouse stroke model, the present study investigated whether hypercholesterolemia exacerbates ischemic
outcomes and any exacerbation of stroke was connected with
inflammation in the brain. In addition, we addressed whether
probucol and cilostazol administered in combination attenuate
hypercholesterolemia-induced exacerbation in ischemic brain
injury via anti-inflammatory effects.
Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for ischemic
stroke. In large clinical trials or patient registries, ~45-60%
of patients exhibit elevated serum cholesterol levels (23,24).
It is well known that cholesterol induces inflammation in

Figure 4. Effect of probucol plus cilostazol in combination on MCP-1 expression and microglia and astrocyte activation in the ischemic brain.
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout (KO) mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) with or without 0.3% probucol (Pro), 0.2% cilostazol (Cilo), or both (Pro+Cilo)
for 10 weeks. Coronal sections of ischemic brain 48 h after MCA occlusion were stained immunohistochemically with (A) MCP-1, (B) CD11b, a sensitive
marker of microglial activation, and (C) GFAP antibody, a sensitive marker of astrocyte activation. The blue rectangle represents the imaging field. MCP-1,

the brain (25-27), and that oxidized metabolites of cholesterol may be involved in the upregulation of inflammatory
markers (28,29). There is also considerable evidence that
hypercholesterolemia and derivations of cholesterol contribute
to a breakdown of the blood brain barrier (30,31), thereby
making hypercholesterolemic patients more susceptible to
stroke. Consistent with the aforementioned studies, our results
showed that ischemic cerebral infarcts induced by 40 min
MCAO and 48 h reperfusion resulted in significantly larger
infarct volumes, neurological deficits and motor deficits in
ApoE KO mice fed HFD for 10 weeks when compared to
ApoE KO mice fed a regular diet. These results are similar to
those of a previous study (11). Moreover, MCP-1 mRNA levels
and MCP-1, CD11b and GFAP immunoreactivity, which are
thought to be involved in neuroinflammation, increased in the
ischemic brain of hypercholesterolemic mice.
Obesity is also a well-established major risk factor for
stroke (32). Clinical studies suggest that the prevalence of
ischemic stroke has markedly increased in children and young
adults, which positively correlated with an increase in risk
factors including obesity, lipid disorders and diabetes (33). In
addition, experimental studies in genetic or diet-induced
obesity models have shown increased cerebral infarct size and
poor outcomes of stroke (34,35). In the present study, we found
that the body weights of ApoE KO mice fed a HFD for
10 weeks were significantly higher than those of mice fed a
regular diet. However, although probucol alone and probucol
plus cilostazol in combination did not affect the body weight,
they improved tissue and functional outcome after ischemic
brain injury with hypercholesterolemia. On the other hand,
probucol alone and probucol plus cilostazol in combination led

to a significant decrease in total- and LDL-cholesterol levels in
ApoE KO mice fed the HFD, suggesting that the beneficial
effects of probucol and cilostazol in stroke with hypercholesterolemia may be due, not to lowering body weight, but only in
part to lipid-lowering properties of the drugs.
Inflammation in the brain caused by activated microglia is
a prominent pathological feature associated with hypercholesterolemia or ischemic stroke. Under pathological conditions,
activated microglia release a variety of neurotoxic compounds
and proinflammatory mediators, which are thought to be
responsible for the pathological conditions. MCP-1 is a
particularly important chemokine that is primarily responsible
for the initiation and progression of inflammatory responses
by promoting the migration and recruitment of inflammatory
cells (36). MCP-1 has been found to regulate the migration
of activated microglia cells to sites of inflammation in the
CNS (37). Overexpression of MCP-1 exacerbates ischemic
injury and enhances recruitment of inflammatory cells to the
sites of injury (38), whereas absence of the mcp-1 gene has
been shown to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury (39). We
found increased MCP-1, CD11b and GFAP immunoreactivity
in hypercholesterolemic ischemic brains, suggesting that
MCP-1 production and microglia and astrocyte activation are
involved in the promotion of hyperlipidemia-induced inflammation and injury in the ischemic brain. Profound shifts to
the reduced MCP-1 and microglia and astrocyte activation in
probucol plus cilostazol-treated mice suggest that probucol
and cilostazol in combination exert neuroprotective effects via
anti-inflammation in hypercholesterolemic ischemic brains.
Probucol, a lipid-lowering agent with antioxidant properties, is involved in the protection against atherogenesis (40).

Probucol is capable of inhibiting the expression of oxidation‑sensitive inflammatory factors, such as VCAM-1  (41),
MCP-1 (42) and IL-1 (43), and attenuating inflammation and
increasing stability of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques in
rabbits (44). Serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines
and matrix metalloproteinases, and expression levels of the
Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR-4, MCP-1, ICAM-1, scavenger receptor A, CD36 and oxidized LDL receptor 1 within
the lesions were markedly decreased in probucol treatment
groups as compared to the control group (44). Cilostazol,
another drug in the combination treatment in this study, is an
inhibitor of type 3 phosphodiesterase that exerts antiplatelet
activity through the suppression of cAMP degradation (6) and
also has pleiotropic effects against inflammation on vascular
function and atherosclerosis (45). Furthermore, cilostazol has
demonstrated in vivo neuroprotective effects against cerebral
ischemic injury via anti-inflammatory effects (7). Therefore,
the combination of probucol and cilostazol may have a
synergistic effect, as the two agents inhibit inflammation.
A previous in vitro study of cultured human coronary artery
endothelial cells (8), in vivo studies in rats, LDL receptor‑deficient mice and ApoE KO mice revealed a synergistic effect
of probucol plus cilostazol against atherosclerotic lesions and
ischemic brain injury (9-11). Park et al showed that probucol
and cilostazol combination therapy inhibited the expression of
VCAM-1 and MCP-1 in cultured human coronary artery endothelial cells with MCP-1 being more effectively inhibited than
when treated with probucol or cilostazol monotreatment (8).
Recently, authors of this study demonstrated a cerebrovascular protective effect of probucol plus cilostazol in
combination in focal ischemic mice with hypercholesterolemia that occurred via the upregulation of endothelial nitric
oxide synthase and adiponectin in acute ischemic injury (11).
In the present study, we focused on the inflammatory properties of probucol and cilostazol administered in combination
with conventional therapy in the subacute phase after cerebral
ischemia. In addition, we reduced the probucol dose from
0.5 to 0.3% to observe the synergistic effects of probucol and
cilostazol against cerebral ischemic brain injury with hypercholesterolemia in this study. Treatment with 0.3% probucol
plus 0.2% cilostazol significantly reduced the infarct volume
with, not only neurological deficits, but also motor deficits
in ApoE KO mice fed a HFD. Furthermore, probucol and
cilostazol in combination reduced hyperlipidemia-induced
inflammation via the inhibition of MCP-1 and microglia and
astrocyte activation. However, 0.3% probucol is likely too high
a dose for the synergistic effects of probucol and cilostazol
to become evident. Accordingly, more studies are required to
determine the clinically relevant probucol dose for the synergistic effect of probucol and cilostazol in ischemic brain injury
with hypercholesterolemia. Collectively, the beneficial effects
of probucol and cilostazol in stroke with hypercholesterolemia
may be due only in part to lipid-lowering properties, with the
primary benefit derived from improved endothelial function
and the anti-inflammatory actions of the drugs.
In summary, the present study has demonstrated that
probucol and cilostazol in combination exerted inhibitory
effects against the expression of the inflammatory chemokine,
MCP-1, in ischemic brains with hypercholesterolemia, which
allowed identification of one of the mechanisms responsible

693

for its anti-inflammatory action. These findings suggest that
probucol plus cilostazol is a potential therapeutic strategy
for reducing the impact of stroke in hypercholesterolemic
subjects.
