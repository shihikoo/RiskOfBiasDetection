Background and Purpose—Postconditioning may be a clinically feasible way to protect the brain after a stroke. However,
its effects during the recovery phase post stroke remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we examine the hypothesis that
ischemic postconditioning amplifies neurogenesis and angiogenesis during stroke recovery.
Methods—Male Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to 100-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or
postconditioning (100-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion plus 10-minute reperfusion plus 10-minute reocclusion).
After 2 weeks, infarct volumes, behavioral outcomes, and immunohistochemical markers of neurogenesis and angiogenesis
were quantified.
Results—Postconditioning significantly reduced infarction and improved neurological outcomes. Concomitantly, brains
subjected to postconditioning showed an increase in doublecortin/BrdU and collagen-IV/Ki67-positive cells.
Conclusions—These results suggest that therapeutic effects of postconditioning may involve the promotion of neurogenesis
and angiogenic remodeling during the recovery phase after focal cerebral ischemia.   (Stroke. 2015;46:2691-2694.

tissue attempts to reorganize and recover.4 In this proof-ofconcept study, we used a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia
to assess the hypothesis that the beneficial effects of postconditioning may involve the amplification of neurogenesis and
angiogenesis during the delayed periods after initial injury.

n a recent consensus workshop, leaders in the innate tolerance field identified postconditioning as a potentially powerful and clinically relevant approach for stroke.1 Experimental
studies suggest that ischemic postconditioning interferes with
cell death mechanisms and reduces infarction during the acute
phase after focal cerebral ischemia.2
In previous studies, 2 key animal models of ischemic postconditioning were mainly used. The permanent distal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) followed by a series
of occlusion of both common carotid arteries and a 100-minute MCA occlusion followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion
and 10 minutes of reocclusion. Ischemic postconditioning
was also investigated in animals subjected to global ischemia
induced by occlusion of the common carotid arteries and of
the 2 vertebral arteries, 4-vessel occlusion, followed by different cycles of noninjurious common carotid artery occlusion.2
Taken together, these studies suggest that postconditioning
may offer positive protective effects during the acute phase
of stroke. However, how postconditioning may provide longer
lasting benefits during stroke recovery remains unclear.3
During the recovery phase after stroke, an increase in
angiogenesis and neurogenesis occurs. It has been proposed
that these neurovascular responses provide the required signals
and substrates for plasticity and remodeling as damaged brain

Methods
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion and Ischemic
Postconditioning
All experiments were performed following protocols approved by
Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. We used 2 groups of
stroke animals: one group exposed to postconditioning and the other
group exposed to standard poststroke care. Transient focal ischemia
was induced by introducing a 5.0 surgical monofilament nylon suture
(Doccol) into the MCA for 100 minutes in male Sprague–Dawley
rats. Ischemic postconditioning was induced as previously described.5
Briefly, the postconditioning technique involves 100 minutes of occlusion, and then reperfusion was established for 10 minutes after
which the MCA was reoccluded for another 10 minutes.5
To analyze cell renewal processes, BrdU was dissolved in PBS
at 10 mg/mL and injected intraperitoneally to a dose of 50 mg/kg
every second day for 2 weeks. Animals were recovered for 14 days.
Neurological scores were graded on a scale of 0 to 4,6 with a higher
score indicating more severe sensory-motor deficits. All procedures
and measurements were performed in a blinded and randomized

Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Infarction volumes were quantified on Nissl-stained sections using the
indirect morphometric method. Immunohistochemistry was performed
as described before.6 To assess microvessel remodeling, double labeling of anti-type IV Collagen (1:10; SouthernBiotech) with anti-Ki67
(1:500; Abcam; a general cell proliferation marker) was pursued as a
surrogate marker of angiogenic-related events. To study neurogenicrelated events, we double stained anti-DCX (1:100; Abcam) with anti
BrdU (1:50; Invitrogen) as a surrogate marker of neurogenesis.
To clarify that Ki67-positive cells are not proliferating microglia/
macrophages, we double stained Ki67and Iba1.

Statistical Analysis
Values are expressed as mean±SD. Infarct volumes and cell counts of
immunopositive cells were assessed with Student t test. Neurological

At 2 weeks, Nissl staining revealed well-defined infarcts in
all control animals subjected to 100 minutes of MCA occlusion (181.9±17.68 mm3, n=8). In rats that were subjected
to ischemic postconditioning, infarct volumes were markedly reduced (132.8±10.74 mm3, n=9, P<0.05; Figure 1A).
Postconditioning had also a positive effect on neurological
outcomes. Rats treated with postconditioning had significantly better scores (0.4±0.4, n=9) compared with controls
(1.2±0.7, n=8; Figure 1B).
Markers of neurogenesis were analyzed in the peri-infarct
regions at 2 weeks. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that
enhanced signals for DCX/BrdU were detected in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Compared with untreated controls (19.67±5.5
positive cells/mm2), DCX/BrdU-positive cells appeared to be
increased in animals subjected to ischemic postconditioning
(53±10.5 positive cells/mm2; Figure 2).
As a marker for angiogenesis, immunostaining was performed to quantify microvessels that were double positive
for collagen-IV and Ki67. As expected, peri-infarct regions
appeared to show an increase in microvessels. The density
of collagen-IV-Ki67 microvessels was significantly higher in
the postconditioning group (80.74±22.49 positive cells/mm2)
compared with controls (30.09±14.07 positive cells/mm2). We
did not detect any increase in Ki67/Iba1 double staining in
postconditioning group compared with controls, suggesting
that microglia may not provide a large contribution to our signals (Figure 3).

Discussion
After brain injury, tolerance mechanisms are activated as part
of the endogenous neuroprotective program.7,8 It is increasingly recognized that finding ways to boost these endogenous
mechanisms may provide novel avenues for stroke therapy.1,9
Accumulating studies in various experimental models now
suggests that ischemic postconditioning may provide acute
protection.10 But what may be missing is a full understanding
of the mechanisms responsible for postconditioning and longterm neuroprotection. In this proof-of-concept study, we used
a rat model of transient focal ischemia to confirm that beneficial effects of postconditioning may last for up to 2 weeks.
Our main goal in this study was to show that potential benefits of postconditioning were accompanied by augmentation
of neurogenic- and angiogenic-related markers in recovering
brain tissue.
Ischemic brain insults potently stimulate progenitor proliferation in both the subgranular zone and subventricular
zone of adult rodents.11 Neuron progenitors are then able to
migrate to injury sites, perhaps as part an endogenous repair
response after stroke and brain injury. Similarly, angiogenesis,
that is, the growth of blood vessels from the existing vasculature, may also contribute to the recovery phase after stroke.
Proangiogenic genes are upregulated within minutes of the
onset of cerebral ischemia in rodents,12 and within the periinfact zone, angiogenesis may significantly participate in neurovascular remodeling and recovery. Increasingly, it has been
suggested that delayed effects of many stroke therapies may
involve the augmentation of neurogenesis and angiogenesis.13
Our findings here raise the possibility that postconditioning
may also recruit these endogenous protective mechanisms.
Taken together, the present study suggests that beneficial
effects of ischemic postconditioning can be maintained up to
2 weeks post ischemia, and the underlying mechanisms may
be consistent with improvements in poststroke neurogenesis and angiogenesis. However, there are several caveats to
keep in mind. First, we only examined a single protocol for

postconditioning. Whether outcomes can be further improved
with different doses and timing remains to be tested. Extending
the present single and 100-minute poststroke postconditioning regimen closer to or even beyond the 4.5 hours of tissuetype plasminogen activator window may be an important next
step. Second, besides neuronal and vascular cells, other cell
types may also be involved. For example, immune cells, such
as macrophages and microglia, are known to contribute to
neurogenic and angiogenic phenomenon. In our study, Ki67positive cells did not double stain for Iba1, suggesting that
postconditioning may not affect this response in our model.
However, further studies to assess effects of postconditioning
on immune profiles are warranted. Third, sustained clinical
benefit must be more rigorously explored. Two weeks end
points may be a reasonable timeframe for exploring delayed
effects in experimental models. But for translational assurance, longer-term studies are needed and more behavioral
studies specific for long-term outcomes should be considered.
Finally, this remains a proof-of-concept study and our results
cannot prove causality. Whether the markers of neurogenesis and angiogenesis are causative or correlational must be
carefully assessed in future gain and loss-of-function experiments. Postconditioning may provide a promising therapeutic
approach for stroke. Continued investigation into its potential
mechanisms is warranted.
