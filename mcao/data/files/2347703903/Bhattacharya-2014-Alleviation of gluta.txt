Abstract Neurotransmitter imbalance is an inevitable
outcome in cerebral ischemia that leads to neuronal death.
In the present study, we evaluated the effects of
piroxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID), on extracellular brain glutamate and γaminobutyric acid (GABA) release, survival time, and
neuronal cell death. Transient focal cerebral ischemia in
male Charles Foster rat led to neuronal infarction and
compromised intrinsic antioxidant status. Thirty-minute
preadministration of piroxicam (10 mg/kg b.w.) showed a
significant (P<0.01) reduction in cerebral infarct volume
and potentiation of the intrinsic antioxidant status. Highperformance liquid chromatography of brain cortex and
striatum revealed changes in extracellular concentrations
of neurotransmitters which were found to be 0.519±
0.44 pmole/mg (GABA); 1.18±0.28 pmole/mg (glutamate), and 0.63±0.21 pmole/mg (serotonin), respectively. Hydroxyl radical (·OH) adduct of salicylate in the

frontal cortex and striatum in control, untreated, and
treated groups was found to be 0.261±0.06, 0.68±0.52,
and 0.401±0.68 pmole/mg, respectively. After stroke, the
extracellular level of glutamate in rat brain increases
continuously as compared to that of control group. However, piroxicam administration in stroke rat significantly
reduced (P<0.05) elevated extracellular cerebral glutamate. This indicates that piroxicam attenuates extracellular glutamate release and also reduces neuronal cell death
due to reduction in oxidative stress in cerebral ischemia.
Our results also indicate a consequent increase of extracellular GABA in brain regions administered with
piroxicam, which hints that piroxicam alleviates glutamate excitotoxicity possibly by GABA agonism.

Introduction
Cerebral ischemia is a devastating condition which affects many people each year and is one of the leading

902

causes of mortality and disability around the world [17,
28, 34, 48]. The narrow time window for the therapeutic
intervention is one of the causes of its progressive pathophysiology and temporal progression of the ischemic
insult. The insult initiates with an occluded blood vessel
which deprives the neurons of glucose and oxygen,
resulting in cell death in the immediate infarct core.
Further, disruptions of ionic homeostasis, release of intracellular potassium, accumulation of intracellular calcium and sodium increased extracellular levels of glutamate, and production of cytotoxic free radicals leads to
cellular injury, necrosis, and apoptosis in areas adjacent to
the initial insult [17, 34]. Reperfusion can revert metabolic derangement in the surrounding penumbral tissue
and prevent progression, but at the same time, it brings
oxidative insult which acts as a curse [17, 23, 34]. Neuroinflammation is also one of the major consequences
after cerebral ischemia. There are several resident cell
populations within brain tissue that are able to secrete
proinflammatory mediators after an ischemic insult [52,
42, 54, 21, 55, 26, 34]. These factors add layers of
complexity, in both adducing their pathophysiological
roles in stroke and in the goal of developing new therapeutics for stroke therapy. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) emerge as one of the
candidate molecule to redress neuroinflammation and
brain swelling as reported in past studies [8, 24].
Stroke leads to release of excessive glutamate and
overstimulation of glutamate receptors which results into
neuronal excitotoxicity [18, 17, 8] by triggering postsynaptic depolarization and influx of positive charges into
the neurons. As a result of this, there is every possibility
for the death of neurons [3, 16, 38, 46]. But, the intrinsic
neuroprotective mechanism of the brain can also not be
overlooked. The most possible internal neuroprotective
mechanisms might be due to simultaneous release of the
inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
to counteract glutamate excitotoxicity by hyperpolarizing
neuron membrane potential and inhibiting glutamatergic
transmission [13, 20, 31, 32]. Drug acting on regulatory
mechanism at the point of glutamate and GABA release
in the cerebral regions sensitive to ischemic insult can
owe to its neuroprotective efficacy that may be the deciding factor for the fate of the surviving neurons.
GABA receptors have a regulatory role on glutamate
release in the insulted brain regions [33, 36, 41, 44, 49].
The striatum is not only known to be vulnerable to
ischemic insult, but also populated with both GABA
and glutamatergic neurons. Previous studies have already

P. Bhattacharya et al.

reported that i.p. administration of exogenous GABA
decreases the glutamate release in cortex following cerebral ischemia [41]. This provides a clue regarding the
positive role of GABA agonist to have neuroprotective
effect. These results were also authenticated by validating
the role of GABA by administration of GABAa and
GABAb antagonists which failed to obliterate the glutamate level as reported by Ouyang et al. [41].
Owing to the past results regarding neuroprotective
efficacy of piroxicam in cerebral ischemia [4–8, 53], in
the present study, we have tried to observe the role of
piroxicam in modulating the exogenous GABA which
might bring changes in the extracellular release of glutamate [50]. This study was undertaken on the basis of
past studies reported by Coyne et al., where it was
reported that NSAIDS have a GABA agonism property,
but no influence on glutamate or glycine [14]. The main
aim to consider striatum with cortex was that according
to the past reports, striatal neurons are known to have
both GABAa and GABAb receptors and activation of
which may decrease potentiation-evoked glutamate and
dopamine release in brain regions including cortex [37,
49, 50]. However, the mechanism of GABAa and
GABAb regulation of glutamate release is yet to be
explored with lucidity. In the present study, we have
evaluated the neuroprotective effects of piroxicam on
the extracellular levels of glutamate and GABA in two
vulnerable brain regions, the striatum and the cortex and
also its role in reducing oxidative stress [35].

Experimental procedure
Chemicals
Piroxicam was purchased from Sigma (USA). GABA,
glutamate, 2,3-dihydroxy benzoic acid (2,3-DHBA),
2,5-dihydroxy benzoic acid (2,5-DHBA), salicylic acid,
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA),
O-pthaldialdehyde, and heptane sulfonic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA.
Acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from Merck
(USA). All other chemicals were purchased from Merck
and Hi-Media if not otherwise specified.
Animals and drug treatment
Male Charles Foster rats (6 weeks, 270±10 g) that were
inbred at the Central Animal House of Banaras Hindu

Alleviation of glutamate mediated neuronal insult

University (Registration No. 542/AB/CPCSEA) were
used for the experiments. Animals were kept under
standard laboratory conditions. Rats were fasted overnight and maintained at 12-h day/night cycle.
Dose optimization of piroxicam and experimental
design
Piroxicam was dissolved in normal saline and administered i.p. 30 min prior to middle cerebral artery (MCA)
occlusion. Pretreatment of untreated animal model with
different concentrations of piroxicam revealed that 10mg/kg body weight i.p. was the optimum dose as revealed by cerebral infarct volume and neurological
score [8]. The diagrammatic representation of the experimental design has been mentioned in Fig. 1. Randomization and exclusion criteria were taken into consideration to assign groups and their findings.
Total no. of animals used in this study were 111.
Fourteen time points were selected to optimize the
base line for both glutamate and GABA in vehicle
and drug-treated vehicle (in triplicate). For TTC staining, untreated and treated rats were again considered
in triplicate. To measure the level of oxidative stress
and effect of piroxicam on the level antioxidants
following ischemic stroke, rats were considered in
triplicate. Those rats(n=8) were excluded from the
study which either did not show significant reduction
in cerebral blood flow by 70 % or they died during
surgery or after surgery before completing the experimental time frame.
Detailed stratification of animals at all end points are
as follows: control = 6, untreated = 6, and treated =
84(HPLC) +7 (total=103). For glutamate estimation in
triplicate (14 time points)=42. For GABA estimation in
triplicate (14 time points)=42. TTC staining (control)=(3–1=2); untreated=(3–1=2); treated=(3–0)=3
[n=9] [2 excluded from study]. OH and DHBA estimation (control) =(3–1 = 2); untreated =(3–1 = 2); treated=(3–1=2) [n=9] [3 excluded from study]. Antioxidant estimation (control)=(3–1=2); untreated=(3–1=
2); treated=(3–1=2) [n=9] [3 excluded from study].
Total=42+42+7+6+6=103; excluded=8.
Induction of focal cerebral ischemia in rat
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by MCA occlusion
(MCAo) with modified intraluminal technique [30].
Rats were anesthetized by the administration of a

903

combination of ketamine (75 mg/kg b.w.) and
xylazine (10 mg/kg b.w.) and then transferred to
the surgical table with a heating pad (INCO, India)
to maintain a constant body temperature of 37±
0.5 °C. Rat was placed in a supine position with
forelimbs fixed on the table by tape, and the fur on
the ventral neck was shaved, and the skin was
cleaned by 0.5 % butadiene and 75 % alcohol.
Eye cream was applied to protect corneal drying.
Midline incision in the neck on ventral side was
done to expose the left common carotid artery
(CCA). A 5.0-cm length 3-0 silicon-coated nylon
monofilament suture was introduced into the carotid artery (CA) lumen through a small nick and
gently pushed from internal CA (ICA) lumen to
block the origin point of MCA. Approximately
18–22-mm length of nylon filament was inserted
to reach the MCA blockade site from the bifurcation point. The external CA (ECA) stump was
clamped around the intraluminal nylon suture to
prevent bleeding. Reperfusion was done by gently
removing the filament after 1 h of ischemia. Animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia and,
on regaining the righting reflex, were transferred to
polypropylene cages in the animal room with temperature maintained at 26±2.5 °C with food and
water supply in ad libitum. In control animals, all
the procedures were carried on except the insertion
of nylon filament. Doppler monitoring (AD, USA)
showed that all rats subjected to MCAO and cortical cerebral blood flow were reduced by at least
70 % of preischemic values within 5 min of advancing the filament and induction of MCAO (data
not shown). Rats not exhibiting significant reduction in cerebral blood flow by 70 % were excluded
from the study.
Neurological score
Neurological scores were derived on five-point
scale with 10 grading scores: A score of 0 indicated
no neurological deficit; a score of 1 means failure
to extend opposite forepaw fully, a score of 2 was
assigned when contralateral circling was seen.
While the rat which was not able to grip the wire
meshes and fell on the contralateral side of brain
damage, a score of 3 was assigned. Further, when
the rats were unable to walk spontaneously and had
a depressed level of consciousness, they were given

904

a score of 4. The neurobehavioral scores obtained
after testing on each scale were averaged to denote
the degree of neurological deficit [30].
Physiological parameters
Rectal temperature of the rats were measured at an
ambient temperature of 21.5±1 °C with a lubricated
digital thermometer probe (Panlab) inserted 3 cm into
the rectum, the rat being lightly restrained by holding in
the hand. Temperature was recorded before any drug
treatment and thereafter every 60 min up to 8 h. Probes
were reinserted from time to time until the temperature
stabilized. Arterial blood parameters (pH, PaCO2, PaO2)
and MAP (Diagno, India) were monitored in all the
animals starting at 30 min preischemia and continuously
throughout the experiment until 120 min of
postischemia in those rats which underwent MCAO
and drug treatment, but no significant differences between the experimental groups were observed as shown
in Table 1.

infarcted portion of brain tissue remains unstained (appeared white). The infarcted areas were captured and
quantified by image analysis software (NIH Image J)
with optical setup [30, 46]. The area of infarction was
measured by subtracting the area of the lesioned hemisphere from that of the nonlesioned contralateral hemisphere. The volume of infarction was calculated by
integration of the lesion areas [47].
Measurement of ·OH by high-performance liquid
chromatography-electrochemical detector
(HPLC-ECD)
We used the salicylate-trapping method to detect extracellular ·OH by measurement of the stable adducts 2,3and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) in the brain
dialysates [29]. Salicylic acid (SA) 100 mg/kg i.p. can
trap the ·OH generated in vivo, and the hydroxylation
products 2,3-DHBA and 2,5-DHBA indicate the quantity of ·OH generated in the brain which ensures the
oxidative stress produced following cerebral ischemia
[51].

Measurement of infarct volume
Estimation of antioxidant status
Rat brains were perfused with normal saline. The brains
were immediately transferred to −20 °C after removal of
the cerebellum. The frozen brains were sliced into uniform coronal sections of 2-mm thickness for TTC staining. The brain slices were incubated in TTC (1 %)
followed by 10 % formalin overnight. Viable brain
tissues became brick red after TTC staining whereas

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was assayed using
an indirect inhibition assay, in which xanthine and xanthine oxidase serve as a superoxide generator, and nitro
blue tetrazolium (NBT) is used as a superoxide indicator. The assay mixture consisted of 960 μl of 50-mM
sodium carbonate buffer (pH 10.2) containing 0.1 mM

This test is based on the principle that live cells possess
intact cell membranes that exclude certain dyes, such as
trypan blue, whereas dead cells do not possess this
ability. Hence, following cerebral ischemia, the dead
cells would have altered membrane permeability, thereby facilitating the entry of this dye into the cell and
staining the cytoplasm blue, and the live cells would
have a clear cytoplasm.
This test was performed by adding trypan blue into
control normoxic neuronal plates containing NB medium or ischemia-exposed neuron plates containing
Locke’s buffer. Following 3–5-min incubation with
trypan blue, the cells in the culture plates were fixed
with 4 % buffered formaldehyde and counted under a
normal light microscope. In each field, the dead and
total numbers of cells were counted, and their ratio
provided an estimate of percentage cell death.

Results
Effect of piroxicam on cerebral infarction
It was found that ischemic infarction covered the cerebral cortex in vehicle rats. A significant reduction in
infraction area was found in cerebral cortex in treated
rats. Quantitatively, the infarction volume and neurological deficit score in the treated rats were found significantly lesser than that of untreated rats. The mean of
infarct volume was found 192.24±12.3 mm3 in untreated rats whereas 42.98±3.3 mm3 in treated rats (Fig. 2a)
while improved neurological deficit was also observed
in treated group (Fig. 2b) (optimization of pretreatment
and posttreatment regime data not shown). Representative images of neuronal survival and cell death of cortical neurons control, untreated, and treated following
focal cerebral ischemia are shown in Fig. 3. Dead neurons were permeable to trypan blue, staining the cytoplasm whereas the live cells have a clear cytoplasm.
Effect of piroxicam on in vivo ·OH formation
Salicylate hydroxylation was shown as an in vivo marker of the ·OH formation by Chiueh [12]. In our studies, it
was observed that SA given 30 min following cerebral
ischemia, and animals sacrificed 2 h after SA administration, could produce a considerable amount of 2,3DHBA and 2,5-DHBA, the most reliable indicator of
·OH adduct as assayed by HPLC with electrochemical
detection [22].
We observed that treated group had a reduced level of
these biomarkers as compared to that of untreated as
shown in Table 2. This clearly justifies that piroxicam
potentiates the intrinsic antioxidative mechanism to
bring about neuroprotection.
Effect of piroxicam on antioxidant level
The changes in antioxidant levels during focal ischemia are shown in Table 3. There was a significant

P. Bhattacharya et al.

decrease in GSH levels (P<0.05) in the cortex and
striatum in untreated group; however, in the presence
of piroxicam, higher levels of GSH were observed.
Further, there was a significant decrease in GPx
(P<0.05) activities untreated, while treatment with
piroxicam restored GPX levels toward the control
values. The present results showed that piroxicam
pretreatment increased the activities of SOD and catalase. Acute treatment of piroxicam caused a significant enhancement in the specific activity of SOD
and catalase in both cortex and striatum.
Effect of piroxicam on the level of glutamate
and GABA
Figure 4 shows the effects of piroxicam administration on monoamines and amino acid neurotransmitter
levels in two brain regions, frontal cortex and striatum in untreated rat groups. The data demonstrate
that glutamate and GABA levels in frontal cortex
and striatum decreased significantly in treated rat
groups.
We have found that the level of glutamate and GABA
increases instantly after the stroke and glutamate reach
maximum at 80 min whereas GABA at 120 min. Our
finding resembles with the finding of Ouyang et al. [40].
To our observation, we found that piroxicam administration significantly (P<0.05) decreased glutamate by
34 %. The peak value of glutamate measured at 80 min
of treated group was 54 % (256±62.3 μM vs 484.3±
166.6 μM) to that of the untreated or in other words
piroxicam reduced 48 % of glutamate release shown in
Fig. 5.
On the other hand, however, GABA concentration during ischemia was also remarkably increased. GABA may protect neurons not only by
directly hyperpolarizing neurons but also by
exerting an inhibitory influence on glutamatemediated neuronal activity, as suggested by this
and many other studies [13]. Although the increase
in extracellular GABA (12.1-fold) in the cortex and
striata (10.09 fold) from baseline to ischemia induced by MCAO was much greater than that of
glutamate (4.9-fold), the peak level of GABA concentration (2.02±0.39 μM) after ischemia was only
one third to that of glutamate (6.52 ± 1.9 μM).
Therefore, it was not unreasonable to use piroxicam
to examine the effect of GABA on regulation of
glutamate release as shown in Figs. 6 and 7.

Effect of piroxicam on the ratio of Glu to GABA
The ratio of Glu to GABA reflects the balance between
the level of cerebral excitatory amino acids and inhibitory amino acids in the brain, which is stable in normal
situation. The result of our finding showed that the ratio
of Glu to GABA in cerebral striatum was 2.92 before
ischemia. After ischemia, the ration of Glu to GABA
rose and reached to the maximal level at 4.95 after
100 min ischemia, which is a significant increase as
compared to that of the ratio before ischemia. The ratio
gradually decreased afterward and reached toward the
minimum at 240 min after ischemia, which was an
increase as compared to that of the ratio before ischemia.
The ration of Glu to GABA in drug-treated group was
remarkably reduced. The results provided the evidence
that piroxicam could inhibit Glu level more than GABA
under the circumstance of cerebral ischemia (Fig. 8).

Discussion
The glutamate/GABA study was undertaken on the
basis of past studies by Costa et al. [13]. Reports suggested that NSAIDs have a GABA agonism property
but has no influence on glutamate [14]. The values of
glutamate and GABA prior to MCAo were 1.39±0.34

and 0.18±0.12 μM, respectively. Following MCAo, the
peak values were 6.52±1.9 μM for glutamate at 80 min
and 2.02±0.39 μM for GABA at 120 min. Although the
time needed for a rise in the peak level of glutamate was
much longer than the time reported by some studies
[45], our results were similar to those of some other
studies [10]. This discrepancy may be due to ischemia
by different methodology or different insult zone.
As reported previously, neither GABAa nor GABAb
receptor antagonists were used to block GABAa or
GABAb influenced glutamate level; hence, it was resolved that only GABAa agonist may bring changes, if
administered [41]. Further, studies reported that exogenous GABA significantly decreased glutamate release;
hence, on this basis, we tried to find a relation between
NSAID and its role as GABA agonist. To our observation, we found that piroxicam administration decreased
34 % glutamate. The peak value of glutamate measured
at 80 min of piroxicam administration was 54 % (261.52
±62.3 vs 484.3±166.6) to that of the untreated group. In
other words, piroxicam reduced as much as 48 % of
glutamate release. Infusion of piroxicam during ischemia decreased glutamate release at 80 min as much as by
54 % (230±53.2 % vs 484.3±166.6 %) with a peak
value of glutamate being only 46.2 % to that of the
ischemic group without piroxicam administration. This
indicates that piroxicam can significantly downregulate
glutamate release from ischemic rat cortex and striatum.
One of the probable mechanisms for the enhancement of inhibitory synaptic transmission in neurons after
ischemia is that presynaptic GABAa receptors help
increase GABA release. Large accumulation of GABA
in the extracellular space has been demonstrated by
in vivo and in vitro studies during ischemia and early
after reperfusion. It is known that GABA release is
initially by exocytosis and later by reversed uptake
through GABA transporters [2, 19]. The initial exocytosis is due to the depolarization by the rundown of Na+
−K+−ATPase. The activation of presynaptic GABAa
receptors increases the chloride concentration in the

Data represented as mean±S.D and P<0.05 was considered significant; * versus control and ** versus untreated

synaptic transmission after ischemia. The present study
could not directly demonstrate that the facilitation of
inhibitory synaptic transmission will reduce
excitotoxicity and thus protect surviving neurons, considering that excitotoxicity is the major mechanism for
postischemic neuronal death. Since some striatal neurons survive ischemia, they must have undergone little
or no excitotoxicity. Previous studies showed that neurons have depressed excitatory synaptic transmission
and depressed excitability after ischemia [43, 15]. But,
we could not equal the depressed excitability to the
depressed excitotoxicity. Whether facilitation of inhibitory synaptic transmission in neurons is directly linked
to depressed excitotoxicity or by some other mechanisms still needs further investigation.
Further, the intrinsic ·OH free radical scavenging
action of piroxicam as revealed by the salicylate-

presynaptic terminals. GABA release happens when
chloride reversal potential is more positive than the
resting membrane potential. Based on this study, the
large accumulation of GABA might be, at least in part,
due to the activation of presynaptic GABAa receptors
located on the GABAergic terminals. In addition,
GABAb receptors are activated under ischemic injury,
which results in depressed synaptic activity [27].
Whether GABA release will be facilitated or depressed
is determined by the interplay among the extent of
energy rundown, presynaptic GABAa receptors (inhibitory or excitatory), and presynaptic GABAb receptors.
This also explains why GABA and glutamate accumulation only occurs during ischemia and early after reperfusion but not long lasting. Thus, the present study
provides a new way to explain the relationship among
GABA, GABAa, or GABAb receptors, and GABAergic

the blood–brain barrier (BBB), some authors have investigated the brain capillary endothelial cell (especially
antioxidant defense system), response to hypoxia [45].
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) belong to the members of enzymatic
antioxidative defense mechanisms against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protect macromolecules, cells,
and cell membranes from peroxidative damage [22].
SOD catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide anion
radical into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide that in turn,
can be removed by GSH-Px and catalase (CAT) [11].

trapping method to detect extracellular ·OH by measurement of the stable adducts 2,3- and 2,5- DHBA in the
dialysates was also a clue to justify its role in reducing
oxidative stress in the striatal environment conducive to
the production of oxidants due to ischemic insult
(Table 2).
There lies a remarkable complexity of interaction
between brain endothelial cells and parenchymal cells,
antioxidant enzyme system in capillary endothelial cells

ischemic brain injury [29]. Using a cell culture model of

ROS are unavoidable products of metabolism, and in
excess, they can be dangerous for tissues and cells. SOD
and GSH-Px, among others, protect tissues and cells
against ROS. In our study, we observed that with the
induction of ischemic–reperfusion tissue injury, total
SOD, catalase, GPx, and GSH reductase activity in
brain decreased, which is also in accordance with the
past studies [11]. Their results demonstrated a constant
decrease in the activities of SOD, CAT, GPxs, and GSH
reductase, suggesting the increase in the susceptibility of
BBB to oxidative damage during reoxygenation. Our
data shows that piroxicam in the optimized dose was
able to potentiate the intrinsic antioxidant defense system by increasing the intrinsic antioxidant status which
Fig. 8 Effects of piroxicam
(10 mg/kg) on ischemia
reperfusion evoked changes in the
ratio of Glu to GABA in cortex
and striatum

may be one of the most potential properties of piroxicam
that can be explored in cerebral ischemia (Table 3).
In the present study, the facilitation of inhibitory
synaptic transmission by piroxicam protects striatal
neurons against ischemic insults. However, we
could not prove the causal link between facilitation
of inhibitory synaptic transmission and the selective
survival of neurons after ischemia. This study has
demonstrated that excessively released glutamate
during ischemic stimulation can be diminished by
the enhanced activity of presynaptic GABA release.
Our work provides a new insight into understanding of the interactions of GABA and glutamate in
cortex and striatum during ischemia.

Our results demonstrate that pretreatment of
piroxicam provides preconditioning of the brain to combat ischemia induced increase in extracellular glutamate
and oxidative stress. It promotes inhibition of the extracellular glutamate by enhancing GABA level and also
decreases the oxidative stress. This property of
piroxicam can be explored for future novel therapeutics
with other antistroke therapy available till date.
