Scope: Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a major pathogenic mechanism of neurological dysfunction and death after ischemic stroke. The aim of our study was to investigate
the effect of procyanidin B2 (PB), a bioactive food compound, on BBB disruption induced by
ischemic stroke and explore the underlying mechanism.
Methods and results: PB was administrated intragastrically once a day starting at 3 h after
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). PB treatment significantly decreased the
infarction volume, brain edema, and neurological deficits after MCAO. PB prevented BBB
disruption against ischemic stroke, as indicated by the reduction of Evans blue leakage and
IgG levels. These results were also corroborated by immunofluorescence staining and Western
blot analysis of ZO-1. Additionally, levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde
were lessened in the ipsilateral ischemic area of brain by PB. The activities of antioxidant
enzymes were elevated. Meanwhile, PB reversed the suppression of NF-E2-related factor nuclear
translocation, and increased the protein expression of HO-1, GST␣, and NQO1 in the ipsilateral
ischemic area of brain.
Conclusion: PB attenuates neurological deficits and BBB disruption in a rat model of cerebral
ischemia, and the neuroprotection of PB is associated with activation of NF-E2-related factor
pathway.

Introduction

Ischemic stroke, also known as cerebral infarction, is defined as the loss of brain function resulting from sudden
occlusion of blood supply to the central nervous system by
a thrombus or embolism [1]. More than 5 million people
die and another 5 million are disabled by stroke worldwide
annually [2]. It is a big burden on our society [3]. Reperfusion is critical in the treatment of cerebral ischemia. However, the occurrence of postperfusion lesions, associated with

inflammation, oxidative damage, and oedema formation,
leads to a secondary injury [4,5]. Given the long-lasting nature
of the secondary mechanisms and their capacity to influence
patients’ outcome, there is an urgent need to discover agent(s)
that can target these pathologies.
The exact mechanisms responsible for the postperfusion
lesions during ischemic injury are still not fully understood
[6]. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a gatekeeper and modulator for the central nervous system, which is disrupted during ischemic stroke and subsequent reperfusion (I/R) [7].
Under normal conditions, the BBB acts effectively to protect the brain from detrimental substances. Oxidative stress
emerging from an imbalance between the production and
metabolism of free radicals functions as triggers of BBB
breakdown [8, 9]. Loss of BBB integrity not only favors the
formation of vasogenic cerebral edema but also promotes
infiltration of circulating leukocytes which exaggerate BBB

breakdown and cerebral inflammation [7, 10, 11]. Therefore,
BBB breakdown may be significant contributing factor to the
postperfusion lesions.
The NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2) pathway, a redox-sensitive
transcription factor is an essential mediator on the expression
of antioxidant enzymes and prevents cell dysfunction from
free radical production [12, 13]. Under basal conditions, Nrf2
binds to the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in
the cytoplasm. In response to oxidative stress, Keap1 is oxidized leading to decreasing affinity for Nrf2, which allows the
translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus. Nrf2 accumulates in the
nucleus and binds to antioxidant response element regions
together with small Maf proteins, resulting in the regulation
of the transcription of antioxidants and the phase II biotransferase [8, 14]. Thus, the Nrf2 signaling pathway is considered
as a beneficial molecular target in response to oxidative stress.
In addition, activation of the Nrf2 pathway in the cerebral microvasculature may provide a novel therapeutic approach for
preventing BBB breakdown and neurological dysfunction in
stroke [8, 14].
Procyanidins, members of the flavanol class of
polyphenols, are oligomers or polymers of (+)-catechin
and/or (−)-epicatechin units [15]. The metabolites of
procyanidins including epicatechin-glucuronide, catechin–
glucuronide, methyl epicatechin glucuronide, methyl
catechin–glucuronide, methyl catechin–sulfate, and methyl
epicatechin–sulfate were detected in the plasma [16]. Procyanidin B2 (PB) composed of two molecules of the flavan-3ol (−)-epicatechin is one of the most common procyanidins
found in plants including cocoa, apples, or grapes and in
beverages such as wine. PB is considered as a bioactive food
component due to its benefits in health promotion as well
as in the restoration and maintenance of homeostasis [17].
Previous studies demonstrated that the extracted procyanidins could effectively protect neurons from memory damage
caused by oxidative stress and reduce cell death during ischemia/reperfusion in cardiomyocytes [18, 19]. In addition,
PB was detected in rat brain after an acute intake of a grape
seed proanthocyanidin extract [20]. Thus, PB can pass the
BBB. However, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of
PB on ischemia-induced BBB breakdown and neurological
dysfunction have not been well characterized.
In the present study, we investigated the effects of PB on
ischemia-induced BBB breakdown and neurological dysfunction. We first examined whether PB treatment can protect
neurons against ischemic stroke by measuring the infarct
size, brain edema, functional recovery, and BBB integrity. In
addition, we examined whether the effect of PB is associated
with activation of the Nrf2 pathway.

Materials and methods

2.1 Experimental animals
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (weighing 200–250 g,
Wuhan University Laboratory Animal Center) were housed

C 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

on a 12 h light–dark cycle at 25 ± 2⬚C, and in a relative humidity of 60–80%. Animals were fed on a diet of standard
pellets and water. The animals were allowed to acclimate to
the housing conditions for 5 days prior to experimentation.
Animal study followed ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines and was approved by
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC),
Wuhan University Center for Animal Experiment, Wuhan,
China (AUP No. S201411012I).

2.2 Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO)
The rats were fasted but provided access to water ad libitum overnight before the induction of cerebral ischemia. The
rats were anesthetized using chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and subjected to MCAO as described previously [5, 21], with minor modifications. In brief, we surgically exposed the left common carotid artery, the internal
carotid artery, and the external carotid artery. A 4-0 nylon
monofilament suture (Beijing Sha Dong Biotech Co. Ltd.)
with a rounded tip was inserted into the internal carotid artery
through the external carotid artery stump and gently advanced
to occlude the MCA. After 2 h of MCAO, reperfusion was accomplished by withdrawing the nylon suture. Laser Doppler
flowmetry (Periflux System 5010; Perimed, Sweden) was performed to monitor the regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) to
determine the MCAO severity during the surgical procedure
and reperfusion. A >80% decline in relative CBF confirmed
an interruption of the CBF in the MCA. A return to >70%
of basal CBF within 10 min of suture withdrawal confirmed
a reperfusion of the MCA territory. The body temperature
was maintained between 36.5⬚C and 37.5⬚C using a rectal
temperature probe and a heating pad (Harvard Apparatus,
Holliston, MA, USA). After recovery from anesthesia, the animals were returned to their cage at room temperature 24
± 1⬚C. Sham-operated animals were subjected to the same
procedure described above without MCAO.

2.3 Animal experimental protocols and drug
application
PB purchased from Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China) was dissolved in normal saline and administered via
gavage. All of the assays were performed by investigators
who were blind to the treatment to which the animals were
subjected.
To observe the effect of PB on infarct size or brain edema,
40 rats were randomly separated into five groups, and each
group was administered with vehicle (equivalent dose of 0.9%
saline administered via gavage) or 40, 20, or 10 mg/kg of PB,
respectively. To elucidate the effect of PB on BBB permeability, the rats (n = 6 per group for Evans blue extravasation and
n = 4 per group for IgG leakage) were randomly separated into
www.mnf-journal.com

two groups: vehicle and PB (40 mg/kg). PB (40 mg/kg) was
administered intragastrically once a day starting at 3 h after
MCAO. For other observations, including immunohistological staining and Western blot analysis, rats were randomly
separated into three groups: sham-operated, vehicle, and PB
(n = 4 per group). PB (40 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically once a day starting at 3 h after MCAO. To elucidate the
improvement in neurological function after ischemic stroke
in rats, the rats (n = 8 per group) underwent neurobehavioral
assays to evaluate the functional outcome after administration of PB (40 mg/kg) once a day starting at 24 h after MCAO.
The neurological deficits were assessed at 1, 3, 7, 11, and 14
days after MCAO.

2.4 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride assessment
of infarct size
For infarct volume analysis, rats were anesthetized and killed
by decapitation 48 h after reperfusion. Their brains were
quickly isolated, cut into consecutive 2 mm thick coronal
slices, and incubated in 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) solution at 37⬚C for 15 min
and incubated for another 15 min after reversal of the slices.
After the end of staining, color images of these slices were
captured using a scanner. All brain slices of each experimental animal were analyzed for the infarct volume using the
Image-Pro Plus 6. Percent-age infarct volume was evaluated
as described by [(VC – VL)/VC] × 100, where VC is the volume of control hemisphere, VL is the volume of noninfarcted
tissue in the lesioned hemisphere [8, 22].

2.5 Measurement of brain edema
For brain water content (BWC) analysis, rats were anesthetized and killed by decapitation at 48 h after reperfusion.
BWC was analyzed to evaluate brain edema. Brain hemispheres were superficially dried, transferred into aluminum
foil, weighed (wet weight), and dried overnight at 90⬚C in a
desiccating oven. The dried slices were then weighed again
(dry weight). The total BWC was calculated according to the
following formula: [(wet weight − dry weight)/wet weight] ×
100% [23].

2.6 Functional assessments
Animals were trained prior to MCAO (training period: three
trials per day for 3 days), and functional deficits were assessed
at 1, 3, 7, 11, and 14 days after MCAO. The order of the
assays (neurological severity score (NSS) and the rotarod test)
were the same to maintain identical testing conditions for all
animals. All of the tests were performed by investigators blind
to the treatment of the animals.


The mNSS is a composite of motor (muscle status and
abnormal movement), sensory (visual, tactile, and proprioceptive senses), reflex and balance assessments. Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0–18: normal score, 0;
maximal deficit score, 18. For the severity of injury scores,
the inability to perform the test or the lack of a tested reflex
was scored as 1 [10, 24].
The rotarod apparatus (Chengdu Technology & Market
Co., LTD., Chengdu, China) is composed of a striated rod
(diameter: 8 cm) divided in six lanes (width: 5 cm). The habituation phase took place before MCAO: each animal had
to stay on the rod rotating at 10 rpm for 180 s. If a rat fell
before 180 s, it was returned to the rod for another trial until
it reached the criterion. The test followed at 1, 3, 7, 11, and
14 days after MCAO: all animals went through three trials separated by a 10-min interval. For each trial, the rat was placed
on the rod (10 rpm), and the latency to fall was recorded. If a
rat clung to the rod without walking for two successive rotations, the latency was recorded and the trial was aborted. The
mean latency between the three trials was used as a measure
of motor coordination.

2.7 Evans blue extravasation
Evans blue extravasation was measured as previously described. In brief, 72 h after MCAO, 4 mL/kg of 2% Evans
blue (Sigma) in saline was administered intraperitoneally.
After 2 h circulation, rats were anesthetized and perfused
with saline through the left ventricle until colorless fluid outflowed from the right atrium. Then, ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were collected after decapitated. Each hemisphere was weighed rapidly, and homogenized in 1 mL of
50% trichloroacetic acid (wt/vol). After centrifugation (12 000
× g, 20 min), the supernatant was collected and mixed with
ethanol (1:3). The concentration of Evans blue was determined by measuring the absorbance at 610 nm and tissue
content of Evans blue was quantified from a linear standard
curve and expressed in terms of Evans blue (␮g)/tissue (g).

2.8 Measurement of SOD, CAT, and MDA in brain
homogenate
The rats (n = 6/group) were killed at 72 h after MCAO
and brain tissue was extracted from the ipsilateral ischemic
area. Brain homogenate (10.0%, w/v) were prepared with
50 mM cold potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min,
and the supernatant was collected for further analysis. All
treatments were done at 4⬚C. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malonaldehyde (MDA)
were assayed using commercial reagent kits obtained from
the Institute of Biological Engineering of Nanjing Jiancheng
(Nanjing, China) according to the instruction manuals. The
analysis of total SOD activity was based on SOD-mediated

inhibition of nitrite formation from hydroxyammonium in
the presence of O2− generators (xanthine/xanthine oxidase)
[25]. CAT activity was based upon alteration of H2 O2 optical
density, depending on enzymatic decomposition of H2 O2 (by
the effect of CAT in the sample) [26]. The MDA concentration
was determined by the previous method [27] and expressed
as nmol mg protein−1 .

2.9 Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
The brain tissue extracted from the ipsilateral ischemic area
was homogenated ten times in a glass of cold PBS on ice,
and filtered by a 300 mesh nylon filter. The filtrate was centrifuged at 600 × g and 4⬚C for 5 min, the supernatant was
discarded, and the sediment was re-suspended with cold PBS
repeatedly. The above operation was repeated three times,
and finally the sediment was suspended with cold PBS. The
suspension was loaded by DCFH-DA probes according to the
concentration of 1:1000 with the active oxygen detection kit
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China). The
monoplast was washed three times by PBS after 20 min of
incubation at 37⬚C, and the DCF fluorescence intensity was
analyzed by spectrofluorimeter [28].

block. Every tenth coronal section for a total five sections was
used for histological and immunohistochemical assessment.
The tissue sections were dewaxed, hydrated, and endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked by treating with 3% H2 O2 in
PBS for 10 min at room temperature. And then, sections were
subjected to microwave antigen retrieval with the use of citrate
buffer, pH 6, for 20 min. After immersion in 5% normal goat
serum, the sections were incubated with one of the following
primary antibodies: rat anti-IgG antibodies, rabbit anti-ZO-1
(all at 1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA), and rat anti-CD31 antibodies (all at 1:100 dilution,
Boster Biotechnology, Wuhan, China). After being washed
with PBS, sections were incubated with FITC-conjugated or
Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200 dilution, Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology), and nuclei were stained with
4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:500 dilution, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). Confocal microscopic images were
acquired using fluorescent microscope.
Statistically analyses IgG leakage was carried out as previously reported [22]. Five areas of ischemic penumbra from
each slide were photographed. And mean optical density for
IgG was measured using Image-Pro Plus software (Media
Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA).

2.12 Western blotting
2.10 Measurement of mitochondrial membrane
potential (࢞␺m)
Brain mitochondria from the ipsilateral ischemic area were
prepared. The final pellet was resuspended in modified
isolation buffer (0.32 mol/L sucrose, 10 mmol/L Tris,
pH 7.4) and kept on ice. Mitochondria were energized
with malate/glutamate (2.5 mmol/L) in a buffer containing
250 mmol/L sucrose, 20 mmol/L Mops, 10 mmol/L Tris,
0.5 mmol/L Mg2+ , and 50 ␮mol/L EGTA, pH 7.0. 5,5 ,6,6 Tetrachloro-1,1 ,3,3 tetraethyl benzimidazolyl carbocyanine
iodide (JC-1; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) staining was used to measure the ࢞␺m changes [29]. Mitochondria (25 ␮g/mL) were
incubated with 2 ␮M JC-1 at 37⬚C for 5 min in darkness. Following three washes with PBS, changes in fluorescent color
in the mitochondria were examined using spectrofluorimeter. The fluorescence intensity of both mitochondrial JC-1
monomers (␭ex 514 nm, ␭em 529 nm) and aggregates (␭ex
485 nm, ␭em 590 nm) were detected. Data were expressed as
a ratio of red to green fluorescent intensity.

2.11 Immunohistological staining
The rats (n = 4/group) were killed at 72 h after MCAO. The
brains were fixed by transcardial perfusion with saline, followed by perfusion and immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde
before being embedded in paraffin. A standard paraffin block
was obtained from the center of the lesion (bregma −1 mm
to +1 mm). A series of 4 ␮m thick sections were cut from the

The rats (n = 4/group) were killed at 72 h after MCAO. Brain
samples from the ipsilateral ischemic area were minced,
washed with saline buffer and homogenized in a Dounce
glass homogenizer in homogenizing buffer (50 mM phosphate buffer/1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, containing 1.5 mM MgCl2 ,
10 mM KCl, and supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) [30]. The homogenates were spun down
for 10 min at 500 × g at 4⬚C. The supernatant was collected
and re-centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4⬚C. The pellet
was resuspended in the same buffer and taken as nuclear
fraction for Nrf2 evaluation and stored at −80⬚C.
Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to Western blot
analysis. Protein lysates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE.
The blocked membranes were subsequently incubated with
antibodies specific against occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1 (all at
1:100 dilution, Boster Biotechnology), HO-1 (at 1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and ␤-actin (at 1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In addition, the blocked
membranes were subsequently incubated with antibodies
specific against Nrf2 (at 1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and nuclear specific anti-lamin B [31] (at 1:200 dilution, Boster Biotechnology) for Nrf2 evaluation in nuclear
fraction. Nrf2 levels were normalized to lamin B levels in the
nucleus. Immunoreactive bands were detected by incubating
the membranes with anti-rabbit, anti-goat, or anti-mouse IgG
antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and using chemiluminescence reagents
to quantify the relative expression (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA).

those in the vehicle groups (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). The BWC
of sham group was 60.8 ± 4.2%, while BWC of vehicle group
was 76.9 ± 8.6% (p < 0.01). The PB (40, 20, and 10 mg/kg, intragastric administration) treated groups decreased the BWC
to 66.8 ± 5.7%, 69.7 ± 3.8%, and 71.1 ± 5.1%, respectively.
And the significant decreases in infarct volume and BWC
were detected between PB (40 and 20 mg/kg, intragastric
administration) treated groups and vehicle groups (p < 0.05).
3.2 PB improved functional outcomes after cerebral
ischemia

Results

3.1 PB protects against cerebral ischemia-induced
infarct volume and brain edema
To observe the effect of PB against ischemic stroke, rats receive different doses of PB at 3 h after MCAO. Brain infarct
volume or brain edema was evaluated at 48 h after MCAO
(Fig. 1A–C). Infarct volume of vehicle group was 35.1 ± 6.4%,
while PB (40, 20, and 10 mg/kg, intragastric administration)
treated groups decreased the infarct volume to 16.0 ± 6.6%,
20.9 ±12.0%, and 24.3 ± 8.3%, respectively, compared with


To examine whether PB treatment regulated functional outcome, a battery of functional tests was performed. No significant differences in the results of the behavioral tests were
detected between the groups prior to MCAO. All of the rats
subjected to MCAO exhibited a progressive decrease in behavioral deficits over time until 14 days after surgery. The
two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant
effect of group (F2,105 = 524.9, p < 0.001), significant effect
of day (F4,105 = 31.9, p < 0.001), and a significant groupby-day interaction (F8,105 = 3.5, p = 0.001). Results of the
rotarod test are presented in Fig. 2B. The two-way repeated

compared to the sham-operated group, indicating the disruption of BBB, as shown in Fig. 1D. However, rats treated with
PB (40 mg/kg) showed a reduction in Evans blue extravasation after MCAO compared with the vehicle-treated ischemic
rat. Ruined BBB integrity increased leakage of serum proteins such as IgG or albumin, which resulted in focal tissue
hypoxia [19]. A tremendous amount of IgG, which permeated
both the cortex and striatum of the ipsilateral hemisphere of
the vehicle group, was detected. Rats treated with PB (40
mg/kg) showed significantly reduced IgG leakage (Fig. 3).
Note that in the sham group, no IgG signal was found in the
same brain regions (Fig. 3, top panel), indicating for an intact
BBB. The above suggests that treatment with PB (40, 20, and
10 mg/kg) decreased BBB leakage.

junction degradation

and the latency of rotarod test (B) after stroke in the three experimental groups (sham control group, vehicle control group, and

both mNSS and rotarod test revealed a significant effect of group,
significant effect of day, and a significant group-by-day interaction. All data were expressed as the means ± SD (n = 8). #p <

measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of group (F2,105
= 151.0, p < 0.001), significant effect of day (F4,105 = 41.4,
p < 0.001), and a significant group-by-day interaction (F8,105
= 2.8, p = 0.007). The results suggest that behavioral outcomes were time-dependent, and PB treatment improves
later behavioral outcomes. Differences between two groups
at one time point were analyzed with independent sample
t-tests. The results shown that the PB treatment group displayed significantly lower mNSS scores and shorter latency
of the rotarod test than the vehicle control group at 7, 11, and
14 days after MCAO (p < 0.05, Fig. 2). These results suggest
that PB induces functional recovery in rats after ischemic
stroke.

To investigate the effect of PB on BBB permeability further,
tight junction (TJ)-related proteins ZO-1 were examined by
immunofluorescence microscopy in conjunction with CD31,
an endothelial marker that also locates on the BBB. ZO-1
was continuously presented in the endothelial cell layer of
microvessels in the brain (Fig. 4). Microvessel walls showed
significantly disruption with typical rearrangement and discontinuous staining after MCAO. In contrast, the microvessel walls of the PB-treated group presented much smoother
and more continuous labeling. Most of all, Western blot
analysis also proved that the significant reduction of ZO-1
levels in both cortex and striatum could be rescued by PB
treatment in the ischemic brain (Fig. 5). Together, these
results further demonstrated that the BBB destruction after cerebral ischemia could be effectively rescued by PB
treatment.

3.5 PB attenuates ischemia-evoked mitochondrial
depolarization and intracellular oxidative stress
The mitochondria are the major sites for ROS generation in
neurons [32]. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress
were shown to be critical determinants of ischemic neuronal
death and survival [33]. PB (40 mg/kg) significantly reduced
mitochondrial depolarization and ROS in the ipsilateral ischemic area (Fig. 6A and B). Moreover, PB reduced the MDA
levels and significantly increased the antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT) comparing to vehicle-treated group (Fig.
6C–E) in the ischemic brain.

3.3 PB regulates BBB permeability after cerebral
ischemia
To evaluate BBB permeability after ischemic injury, BBB leakage was measured using Evans blue extravasation and IgG
immunostaining at 72 h after MCAO. The results indicated
that Evans blue extravasation was increased in ischemic rats

To test whether PB exerts its beneficial effects by activating
the Nrf2 pathway, we investigated the Nrf2 protein expression in nuclear fraction from the ipsilateral ischemic area by
Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 8, the accumulation of Nrf2 nuclear translocation was significantly lower in
the model control group (p < 0.05). Moreover, PB reverses
the suppression of Nrf2 nuclear translocation (p < 0.05).

3.7 PB potently activates the Nrf2
The activation of Nrf2 is the major signaling pathway involved
in Nrf2-mediated phase II detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes.

It is suggested that the protective action of PB is related to
induction of antioxidant defense. Thus, we treated normal
animals with PB intragastrically for 3 days and measured
Nrf2 nuclear translocation and HO-1, GST␣, and NQO1 protein expression. As shown in Fig. 9, PB led to a significant
accumulation of Nrf2 nuclear translocation and a significant
increase in HO-1, GST␣, and NQO1 protein expression in
the brain parenchyma after PB administration for 3 days.

Discussion

In this study, we show that: (i) PB protects against cerebral
ischemia-induced infarct volume and brain edema; (ii) PB
confers functional recovery of rats following ischemic stroke;
(iii) PB regulates BBB permeability and attenuates TJ degradation after cerebral ischemia; (iv) the effect of PB is related
to activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway.

by a 4b → 8 bond [34]. As a dimeric form, PB is more powerful
than other water-soluble polyphenols in terms of the biological activities [35]. It has been reported that PB has a wide range
of biological activities including free radical scavenging and
antioxidant [35,36]. It is well accepted that antioxidant defense
play a primary role in protecting the gliovascular unit against
the secondary injury in stroke [37]. In addition, procyanidolic
oligomers decrease BBB permeability induced by bacterial
collagenase [38]. Therefore, PB may provide BBB protection
and functional recovery against cerebral ischemia. The activation of the antioxidant defense may be the key contributor
of the neuroprotection of PB.

In this study, we confirm that PB treatment at doses of
10–40 mg/kg substantially reduces the infarct size and brain
edema in rats 48 h after MCAO. Collectively, these results
show that PB can efficiently reduce brain injury in the acute
phase of ischemic stroke. In addition, the assessment of neurological functional recovery is important for evaluating therapies aimed at enhancing brain tissue plasticity after stroke
[39–42]. To characterize the functional recovery in cerebral
ischemia after PB supplementation, we had carried out a battery of functional tests (NSS and the rotarod test). As a result,
administration with PB conferred an improvement in motor
and neurological function, in addition to reduced hemiparesis compared to vehicle-treated animals.
As a cerebral vascular disease, stroke is often companied
with BBB disruption [43]. The BBB, located at the cerebral
microvessel endothelial cells, is critical for brain homeostasis [44]. In cooperation with pericytes, astrocytes and microglia, the BBB prevents plasma components from infiltrating the brain [43, 45]. Cerebral ischemia leads to a disruption and reconstruction of TJ proteins, and an increase
in BBB permeability [8]. The disruption of BBB is a critical event in the progression of ischemic stroke. It initiates a complex cascade of events that lead to focal brain
injury [22]. Consequently, some neurotoxin, viruses, and neutrophils/microphages could cross the disrupted BBB and
greatly increase inflammation, oxidative damage, and edema
formation. Thus, maintenance of BBB integrity becomes a
key strategy to protect brain from secondary injury after cerebral ischemia. In this study, the severity of BBB disruption
has been showed in various measures, such as Evans blue
leakage, brain edema, and IgG immunofluorescence staining. Less-severe BBB disruption can be found in the rats with
the PB treatment compared to the vehicle group, suggesting
an intact BBB.
Microvascular endothelial cells constitute the BBB and
surrounding astrocytic end-feet regulate barrier permeability [8]. The endothelial cells are fitted with specialized structures, such as cell–cell adhesion complexes obliterating the

paracellular space (TJs) and an array of transport and shuttle proteins controlling the flux of ions and solutes [46, 47].
TJ proteins, the core part of the BBB, serve the major functional purpose of providing a "barrier" and a "fence" within
the membrane, by regulating paracellular permeability and
maintaining cell polarity [48]. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis of TJ proteins ZO-1 further
demonstrated that PB preserved BBB integrity after cerebral
ischemia. In addition the loss of TJ proteins in the microvasculature has been shown to be likely mediated by oxidative
stress [49–51].
Oxidative stress is a physiological status associated with
unbalanced between free radical and antioxidant defenses.
Antioxidant defenses have been implied in the beneficial effects of dietary phytochemicals against neurodegeneration
[8, 52]. Previous studies have implied PB possesses strong
free radical scavenge activity and antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of PB in ischemic brain has been showed
through measurement of the activity of antioxidant enzymes
(SOD and CAT) and level of ROS, mitochondrial membrane
potential, and MDA.
Activation of Nrf2 through modification of Keap1 cysteine, lead to upregulation of the antioxidant response element, plays a central role in cellular defense against ROS and
xenobiotic electrophiles [8]. Activation of the Nrf2 pathway
is a promising therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative
diseases [53]. It has been demonstrated that PB protects human colonic cells against oxidative stress by activation of the
transcription factor Nrf2 [54]. However, the effect of PB on
the Nrf2 translocation in brain has not been reported. In
this manuscript, PB was found to increase the Nrf2 nuclear
translocation and phase II detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes
(HO-1, GST␣, and NQO1) protein expression in the normal
brain parenchyma. And then, we did research on the effect
of PB on the Nrf2 nuclear translocation at 72 h after MCAO.


The expression of Nrf2 and antioxidant genes as HO-1 in vehicle group is different from the data in the literature [8, 55].
The difference may be related to a context-specific manner
(i.e. the time of MCAO, time of reperfusion, or degree of ischemia). Endogenous Nrf2 nuclear translocation and phase
II detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes protein expression were
effectually increased with PB intervention.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that PB treatment can provide neuroprotection based on its improvement in the infarct
size, brain edema, and functional recovery following MCAO
in rats. PB preserved BBB integrity and reduced the loss of
TJ proteins. Moreover, this study reveals that the effect of PB
can be partially attributed to the activation of the transcription
factor Nrf2, resulting in the upregulate antioxidant defenses.
Together we presented strong evidence that PB could be an
effective neuroprotective agent to protect against ischemic
stroke.
The authors have declared no conflict of interest.
