Heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) is known to function as a protective molecular chaperone that is massively induced in response to misfolded proteins following cerebral ischemia. The objective of this study was
to characterize HSP70 induction by Z-ligustilide and explore its potential role in protection against cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury. Our results demonstrated that the intranasal administration of Z-ligustilide
reduced infarct volume and improved neurological function in a rat stroke model. Meanwhile, Z-ligustilide
enhanced the cell viability of PC12 cells insulted by oxygen–glucose deprivation-reoxygenation (OGD-Reoxy)
and decreased apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Importantly, Z-ligustilide induced HSP70 expression both in
vitro and in vivo. Although heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1) nuclear translocation was promoted by Z-ligustilide,
HSP70-based heat-shock element (HSE)-binding luciferase activity was not activated, and HSP70 expression responsive to Z-ligustilide was not attenuated by HSE decoy oligonucleotides. However, Z-ligustilide
signiﬁcantly activated the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Further inhibition
of MAPK activity by speciﬁc inhibitors attenuated HSP70 induction by Z-ligustilide. Meanwhile, downregulation of HSP70 using KNK437, an HSP70 synthesis inhibitor, or small hairpin RNA (shRNA) signiﬁcantly
attenuated the protection of Z-ligustilide against OGD-Reoxy-induced injury. Moreover, the application of
speciﬁc inhibitors of MAPKs also achieved similar results. Finally, Z-ligustilide alleviated the accumulation
of ubiquitinated proteins induced by OGD-Reoxy, which was inhibited by HSP70-shRNA. Taken together,
our results demonstrated that Z-ligustilide may induce protective HSP70 expression via the activation of the
MAPK pathway, but not canonical HSF1 transcription. HSP70 plays a key role in the protection of Z-ligustilide against OGD-Reoxy-induced injury.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Infobase reports that stroke has become the second leading cause of mortality in the world, causing around 6000000 deaths annually.1)
However, there are currently relatively few treatment options
available to minimize damage or death following a stroke.
Protein aggregates containing ubiquitinated proteins are commonly present in neurodegenerative disorders and have been
considered to cause neuronal degeneration. The previous study
also showed that transient cerebral ischemia caused severe
protein aggregation in hippocampal CA1 neurons which appeared at 4 h and progressively accumulated at 24 and 48 h.2)
Therefore, control of protein aggregation may represent an
alternative treatment to neurological damage caused by ischemic stroke.
Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a group of phylogenetically
and ubiquitous cytoprotective proteins found in all prokaryotic
and eukaryotic cells, many of which are chaperone molecules
that facilitate protein folding, trafﬁcking and also prevent their
aggregation and degradation.3) Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)
is a major inducible heat shock protein that basically functions
as a molecular chaperone and plays an important role in preventing protein aggregation, degrading unstable and misfolded

proteins and transporting proteins between cellular compartments.4) It’s reported that over-expression of HSP70 via transgenes and viruses or systemic administration of HSP70 fusion
proteins that allow it to cross the blood brain barrier protects
the brain against ischemia,5,6) suggesting that increasing
HSP70 level or activity may be a potential therapeutic target
for pharmacological intervention of ischemic diseases.
Ligusticum chuanxiong is a commonly used Chinese herbal
medicine with its empiric treatment of cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases.7) Z-Ligustilide as the major bioactive phthalide compound of Rhizoma chuanxiong was previously suggested for the prevention and treatment of ischemic
stroke.8,9) Our and others’ studies showed that Z-ligustilide
could protect ischemic injury both in vitro and in vivo via
the induction of direct and indirect antioxidant response.8,10,11)
However, its effect on the heat shock response, a highly conserved and fundamental cytoprotective mechanism, under
ischemic stress remains unexplored. Along this line, we characterized the effect of Z-ligustilide on HSP70 and explored
the potential role of HSP70 in the protection of Z-ligustilide
against oxygen–glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGDReoxy) induced injury in this study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials Z-Ligustilide was obtained from the Hong
Kong Jockey Club Institute of Chinese Medicine (Hong
Kong, China) with a purity of >98% and stored in −80°C
before use.12) HSP70 antibody was purchased from beyotime
(Jiangsu, China). The antibody against heat-shock factor 1
(HSF1) was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (NY, U.S.A.)
and lamin b1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(CA, U.S.A.). The antibodies against β-actin and rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). The antibodies against p-p38, p-c-Jun
N terminal kinase (JNK) and p-extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Boston, MA, U.S.A.). Other chemicals were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich Co., unless indicated otherwise.
Animals and Ischemia–Reperfusion (I/R) Model in Vivo
Sprague-Dawley male (230–260 g) rats were offered by the
Institute of Laboratory Animals, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital. All
procedures were approved according to the Animal Care and
Use Committee of Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences &
Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital and the Sichuan Province
Animal Care Ethics Committee. To test the potential protective effect against the damage induced by I/R, one dose of Zligustilide (7.5, 15 or 30 mg/kg) was administered via intranasal route for 3 d. Rats in the sham and vehicle group received
volume-matched vehicle. Middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO)-induced focal cerebral ischemia was performed as
described previously.13) Brieﬂy, rats were anesthetized with 7%
chloral hydrate intraperitoneally at a dose of 350 mg/kg and
the MCA of the right side was occluded by gently advancing a
4-0 silicon-coated monoﬁlament nylon suture with a round tip.
Reperfusion was introduced by withdrawing the monoﬁlament
after 1 h of occlusion. Sham surgeries were performed in the
same way, except that the ﬁlament was not advanced to the
origin of the MCA. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C
during and after the procedure.
Measurement of Infarct Volume and Neurological Function At 24 h after ischemia, brains were immediately removed, rinsed in cold saline solution and sliced into 5 coronal
sections (2 mm thick). The sections were immediately stained
with 0.5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37°C
for 30 min. Infarct volume was then measured as described
previously.14) The infarct volume was expressed as a percentage of the volume of the contralateral structure for correcting
the brain swelling.
As previously described, neurologic deﬁcits were blindly
performed according to the scoring system of Garcia et al.15)
prior to and 24 h after MCAO. This 18-point scale includes the
following six tests-spontaneous activities, symmetry of movements, symmetry of forelimbs, climbing, reaction to touch on
either side of trunk, and response to vibrissae touch. All tests
were scored individually and added together to obtain a neurological score ranging from 3–18 with higher scores indicating
less disability.
Cell Culture Both PC12 and 293T cells were obtained
from the American Type Cell Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA, U.S.A.). PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% horse
serum (Invitrogen, U.S.A.), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)

(Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) on collagen I-coated dishes. 293 T cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Both cell lines were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 and 95%
air atmosphere.
Measurement of Cell Viability As previously described,16) cell viability was evaluated by a Cell Counting Kit-8
(CCK-8) assay (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan).
Brieﬂy, at the end of drug treatment, CCK-8 solution (10 µL)
was added to each well, followed by incubation for 3 h at 37°C.
The absorbance at 450 nm was determined by a microplate
reader (Lambda Bio-20; Beckman). Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of that of the control (untreated) cells.
YO-PRO-1 and Propidium Iodide (PI) Dual Staining
As previously described,17,18) cell death was assessed by YOPRO-1 (Molecular Probes) and PI (Molecular Probes) dual
staining. Brieﬂy, at the end of drug treatment, YO-PRO-1 and
PI dyes were added to the culture medium (0.1 µM, and 1.5 µM,
respectively) for 30 min. Images were collected with a Zeiss
ﬂuorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).
Procedure of OGD-Reoxy To model I/R like conditions
in vitro, PC12 cells were exposed to OGD-Reoxy treatment as
described previously.19) In brief, PC12 cells were ﬁrst incubated in glucose-free DMEM and subsequently transferred into a
Tri-Gas incubator (Heal Force, HF100) with 1% O2, 94% N2
and 5% CO2 for 9 h at 37°C. Sham OGD cultures were maintained in a normal oxygenated DMEM. Following the OGD
treatment, cells were returned to the normoxic incubator with
normal culture medium and incubated for another 16 h.
Western Blotting Analysis The cellular proteins were
extracted from cerebral cortex or PC12 cells in ice-cold radio
immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies, U.S.A.) supplemented with 1% (v/v) protein inhibitor
cocktail and 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF) and
the nuclear proteins were extracted with nuclear extraction kit
(Millipore, U.S.A.). Thirty micrograms of the cellular proteins
were resolved by electrophoresis in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel, and subsequently transferred to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane. Following 1 h incubation in a fresh TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween-20 and
5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), the blots were probed with
speciﬁc primary antibodies. After incubation with the relevant
secondary antibodies, the reactive bands were identiﬁed using
an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagent (GE
Healthcare, Sweden). The concentration of the loaded cellular
proteins was normalized against the internal control β-actin or
lamin b1, and then the value was expressed as each normalized
data relative to control.
Luciferase Assay The luciferase assay was performed
as previously described.20) Brieﬂy, PC12 cells were seeded
in 6-well plates and incubated at 37°C in a CO2 incubator
for 24 h until conﬂuence reached 70–80% and transfected
with HSE-luc, a plasmid containing an inducible Rat Hsp70
promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene, by lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
After 24 h of growth, cells were treated with either 5 µM Zligustilide for up to 4 h. As a positive control, cells were heatshocked at 42°C for 30 min and incubated at 37°C for 3 h and
30 min. Luciferase assays were performed by using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Beyotime, China) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fireﬂy luciferase activity

value was normalized to Renilla activity value. Promoter activity was presented as a percentage of change compared with
the vehicle-treated control.
Decoy Design and Treatment ARE decoy oligonucleotides (ODNs) were used in this study to inhibit HSF1 mediated gene expression according to previous study.21) Upperstrand and reverse-complement phosphorothioated ODNs were
commercially synthesized and puriﬁed by Sangon Biotech
Inc. (Shanghai, China). Double-stranded decoy ODNs were
prepared by annealing complimentary single strands in sterile saline. In addition to the HSE decoy ODNs, a scrambled
decoy ODNs (mut ODNs) was used as control for speciﬁcity.
The following sequences were used in these studies: HSE,
5′-GAT CCT TAT AAG GTC TCC AAA GC-3′ and its compliment and HSE mut, 5′-TTA GCG CTC ATA GCC AAG TAA
TC-3′ and its compliment. To determine the transfection rate
and cellular localization of HSE decoy ODNs, ODNs were
5′-end-labeled with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). To
increase the delivery of ODNs into the cell, lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, U.S.A.) was used in the transfection treatment. The heat-shock element (HSE) decoy and HSE mut

ODNs were added to the cells at 100 n M in the presence of
lipofectamine 2000. After 24 h of incubation, Z-ligustilide was
added directly to the medium as described before.
Expression Knockdown of HSP70 with KNK437 or
HSP70-shRNA KNK437, N-formyl-3,4-methylenedioxybenzylidene-g-butyrolactam, is an inhibitor of HSP70 synthesis. It was administered 24 h before Z-ligustilide treatment
with a concentration of 100 mg/mL.4)
Four shRNA sequences targeting HSP70 (Gene ID: 24472)
were from the positions (shRNA1, 2317; shRNA2, 2914;
shRNA3, 3002; shRNA4, 1552) relative to the start codon and
synthesized by GeneChem Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). After
testing knockdown efﬁciencies, stem-loop DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by GeneChem Co., Ltd. (shRNA; sense,

vector as a negative control (NC). HSP70-shRNA-lentiviral
plasmid and negative control (NC)-shRNA plasmid were respectively packaged with 293T cells using the ViraPower
Lentiviral Expression Systems (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Two days after package, green
ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) expression was observed. Lentiviral particles were harvested within 48–72 h post-transfection.
PC12 Cells were infected with HSP70-shRNA-lentivirus or
NC-shRNA-lentivirus. For each transfection, 1 mL of the lentiviral particles and 1 mL of the complete medium with 6 µg/
µL of polybrene were added gently to the cells. After 24 h
incubation, the mixture was replaced by 2 mL fresh complete
medium for another 24 h. Fluorescent microscope was used to
observe the GFP expression. Then, the transfected cells were
used for further experiments.
Statistical Analysis All data were presented as mean±
standard deviation (S.D.) for three independent experiments.
Statistical analysis was performed by two-tail Student’s t-test
or ANOVA test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to
be statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
Z-Ligustilide Protected Brain from Injury Induced by
I/R To address the potential therapeutic role of Z-ligustilide
in I/R induced damage, we ﬁrst examined its effect on rat
MCAO model. Rats were pre-treated with Z-ligustilide via intranasal administration for 3 d, once daily before occluding the
blood supply. As shown in Figs. 1A and B, infarct volume in
7.5 or 15 mg/kg of Z-ligustilide treated group was signiﬁcantly
smaller than that of vehicle-treated rats at 24 h after ischemia.
Besides, our neurological function evaluation showed that
pretreatment with 15 mg/kg of Z-ligustilide signiﬁcantly improved the neurological function at 24 h after ischemia (Fig.

1C). These results demonstrated that Z-ligustilide protected
I/R-injured rat brain.
Protective Effect of Z-Ligustilide against OGD-Reoxy
Induced Injury in PC12 Cells In our previous study, we
reported the protective effect of Z-ligustilide against OGDReoxy induced injury.10) In the current study, we conﬁrmed
the protection of Z-ligustilide with the concentration of 5 µM,
which exhibited the best protective effect in our previous
study.10) As shown in Fig. 1D, Z-ligustilide (5 µM) signiﬁcantly
protected PC12 cells from OGD-Reoxy induced cell death
while it also promoted the viability of PC12 cells under normal condition.
Then, we further characterized the type of cell death during
this process. As shown in Fig. 1E, control cells displayed negative staining with YO-PRO-1 (which stains apoptotic cells)
and PI (which stains dead or dying cells). Exposed to OGDReoxy, cells were positively stained with both YO-PRO-1 and
PI, indicating that cells underwent both apoptotic death and
necrotic death after insulted by OGD-Reoxy. Treatment with
Z-ligustilide (5 µM) signiﬁcantly decreased the positive staining of both YO-PRO-1 and PI, which further conﬁrmed the
protective effect of Z-ligustilide.
Z-Ligustilide Induces HSP70 Expression in Vitro and
in Vivo To determine whether Z-ligustilide induces the
expression of HSP70, a protein known to be associated with
unfolded and misfolded proteins following cerebral ischemia,
we treated PC12 cells with 5 µM of Z-ligustilide for up to 16 h.
As a result (Fig. 2A), expression of HSP70 was substantially
induced by Z-ligustilide as early as 2 h after treatment. Furthermore, our results showed that Z-ligustilide signiﬁcantly
induced HSP70 expression in a dose-dependent manner within
the concentrations of 1.25–5 µM (Fig. 2B).
To determine the potential inﬂuence of Z-ligustilide on the
HSP70 expression in vivo, we performed Western blotting to

detect HSP70 in the cerebral cortex after I/R. As shown in
Fig. 2C, I/R induced a signiﬁcant increase of HSP70 expression compared with that in the sham group. HSP70 expression
further increased when I/R rats were pre-treated with 15 mg/
kg of Z-ligustilide.
Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) but Not
HSF1 Mediate HSP70 Induction by Z-Ligustilide Transcription factor HSF1 is reported to be the key regulator
responsible for HSP70 induction.22) To determine the role
of HSF1 in the HSP70 induction by Z-ligustilide, we ﬁrst
analyzed the nuclear protein and found that Z-ligustilide promoted the nuclear translocation of HSF1 (Fig. 3A). However,
the activity of luciferase reporter carrying HSP70-based HSE
did not increase, which demonstrated that Z-ligustilide did not
activate HSF1-mediated transcription of HSP70 (Fig. 3B). This
result was further conﬁrmed by the fact that HSP70 expression induced by Z-ligustilide didn’t change after inhibition of
HSF1 driving downstream genes with HSE decoy ODN (Fig.
3C). Therefore, Z-ligustilide induced HSP70 induction may
be not regulated by HSF1 and the upstream mechanisms by
which Z-ligustilide activates HSP70 require further investigation.
Recently, a number of studies suggest that HSP70 has been
connected to MAPKs signaling pathway.23,24) As HSF1 isn’t
the regulator of HSP70 induced by Z-ligustilide, we then asked
whether MAPKs pathway plays a possible role in this process.
As shown in Figs. 4A–C, upon exposure to Z-ligustilide,
phosphorylation of ERK1, 2 peaked at 0.5 h, phosphorylation
of p38 peaked at 1 h and phosphorylation of JNK 1, 2 peaked
at 1 h as well, suggesting that Z-ligustilide activated MAPKs
pathway. To further verify the involvement of MAPKs in the
induction of HSP70 by Z-ligustilide, we respectively assessed

how Z-ligustilide-induced HSP70 expression was affected by
speciﬁc kinase inhibitors. As a result, ERK inhibitor PD98059
(Fig. 4D), p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 4E) and JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 4F) partially suppressed the expression of
HSP70 induced by Z-ligustilide, respectively, suggesting that
ERK, JNK and p38 may be involved as upstream targets in
the initiation of HSP70 synthesis by Z-ligustilide.
Z-Ligustilide Ameliorates OGD-Reoxy Induced Injury
via HSP70 and MAPKs To determine the role of HSP70 in
Z-ligustilide mediated protection against OGD-Reoxy induced
injury, we further examined whether inhibition of HSP70
synthesis or silencing of HSP70 gene affected the protective
effect of HSP70. As shown in Figs. 5A and C, pretreatment
with KNK437 and silencing of HSP70 gene by RNAi notably down-regulated the up-regulation of HSP70 expression
induced by Z-ligustilide. In in vitro OGD-Reoxy model, Zligustilide alone signiﬁcantly protected PC12 cells against
OGD-Reoxy induced cell death (p<0.01), whereas this protective effect disappeared in the presence of 100 mg/mL KNK437
(Fig. 5B). Similarly, the HSP70-shRNA also considerably
reduced Z-ligustilide mediated protection against OGD-Reoxy
(p<0.01) (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that Z-ligustilide reduced OGD-Reoxy induced injury involving HSP70 induction.
Then, we further explored the role of MAPKs activated
by Z-ligustilide in its protective effect against OGD-Reoxy
induced injury. As showed in Fig. 5E, each of inhibitors
(PD98059, SB203580 and SP600125) signiﬁcantly inhibited
Z-ligustilide’s protection of PC12 cells against OGD-Reoxy
induced cell death. The results demonstrated that MAPKs
pathway may have direct correlation not only with induction
of HSP70 but also with Z-ligustilide mediated protection.

tion via HSP70 Induction To study the biological signiﬁcance of the heat shock response induced by Z-ligustilide, we
further determined the effect of Z-ligustilide on the ubiquitinated protein aggregation. As expected, both MG132 (a
speciﬁc proteasome inhibitor) (Fig. 6A) and OGD-Reoxy (Fig.
6B) caused the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. Zligustilide signiﬁcantly reduced the amounts of ubiquitinated
proteins induced by either MG132 or OGD-Reoxy (p<0.01).
Importantly, HSP70-shRNA signiﬁcantly decreased the alleviating effect of Z-ligustilide on protein aggregation induced
by either MG132 or OGD-Reoxy compared with that of NCshRNA. These ﬁndings demonstrated that blocking ubiquitinated protein aggregation may be an important mechanism by
which Z-ligustilide protects cells from OGD-Reoxy induced
damage via HSP70 induction.

DISCUSSION
Protein aggregation is a biological phenomenon in which
abnormal proteins accumulate and clump together either intraor extra-cellularly. It has been thought to play a pivotal role
in the neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson’s disease
and Alzheimer’s disease.25) Currently, protein aggregation is
also regarded as one of the important pathological features of

cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R).26) It has been reported
that protein aggregation leads to neuronal death after transient
cerebral ischemia.2) HSPs with their chaperonic function are
strongly involved in cellular protection under stressful conditions, which shares the ability to recognize and bind nascent
and unfolded proteins, thus preventing aggregation and facilitating proper protein folding.27) HSP70, a stress inducible
chaperone, has been studied for its potential to protect brain
from ischemic injury. This protective effect may be mediated
by one or more of activities ascribed to HSP70, including refolding denatured proteins and preventing unfolded and damaged proteins from aggregating.28) Therefore, it has received
particular attention as a molecular target for pharmacological
intervention of ischemic diseases.
Z-Ligustilide, one of phthalide compounds derived from
Rhizoma chuanxiong, exhibited numerous activities in the
prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke.8,9) However, it
has been reported that Z-ligustilide was metabolized into
seven metabolites and showed a low bioavailability after oral
administration.29) It is possible that the protective effect of Zligustilide via oral administration on I/R injury may be due
to the indirect effect exerted by its metabolites. On the other
hand, Z-ligustilide could quickly enter the brain after intranasal administration,30) which implicated that intranasal admin-

istration may be a reasonable way for Z-ligustilide to exert its
direct effect on I/R injury. In the current study, our results
showed that pre-treatment with Z-ligustilide via intranasal
administration signiﬁcantly protected against rat brain damage
induced by transient MCAO in terms of infarct volume and
neurobehavioral function, which conﬁrmed the above deduction. Meanwhile, Z-ligustilide also signiﬁcantly enhanced the
cell viability of PC12 cells and decreased the apoptotic and
necrotic cell death caused by OGD-Reoxy. In our previous
study, Z-ligustilide exhibited antioxidant and cytoprotective
effect against OGD-Reoxy injury partially via the activation
of Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathway.10) However, its effect on heat
shock response and the role of HSP70 involved in this process
remain unexplored. Therefore, the present study was further
designed to evaluate the HSP70 induction by Z-ligustilide
and the potential role in the protection against I/R injury.
Very much as expected, Z-ligustilide signiﬁcantly induced
the expression of HSP70 protein in both in vitro and in vivo.
However, our further results demonstrated that HSF1 does not

regulate over-expression of HSP70 induced by Z-ligustilide.
In support of our results, others’ studies also found that HSF1
rises were not followed by enhanced HSP70 expression.31,32)
Recently, cytoprotective functions of HSPs, particularly
HSP70, have been connected to MAPKs signaling pathway.33,34) For this reason, we investigated whether there is involvement of MAPKs in the induction of HSP70 by Z-ligustilide. As a result, phosphorylation of the three MAPKs was
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by Z-ligustilide. Further inhibition of
MAPKs activity achieved by respective inhibitors signiﬁcantly
attenuated Z-ligustilide induced HSP70 expression. These results indicate that MAPKs may be involved in the induction of
HSP70 by Z-ligustilide as upstream targets.
Previous study demonstrated that HSP70 may enhance
the cellular resistance to I/R induced protein aggregation via
recognizing and binding nascent and unfolded proteins, and
facilitating correction of protein folding.6,35) Thus, we further
investigated the role of HSP70 in the protective effect of Zligustilide against OGD-Reoxy induced injury. The results

Z-Ligustilide Alleviates the Accumulation of Ubiquitinated Proteins via HSP70 Induction

(A) PC12 cells were transfected with HSP70 shRNA-lentivirus for 48 h, followed by Z-ligustilide (5 µM) treatment for 2 h. Subsequently, the culture medium was replenished and the cells were incubated in fresh medium overnight. Then, the cells were treated with 500 n M MG132 for 30 min. Cell lysate was used to determine ubiquitinated
proteins via Western blotting. (B) PC12 cells were transfected with shRNA-lentivirus for 48 h, followed by Z-ligustilide (5 µM) treatment for 2 h. Subsequently, the cells
were subjected to OGD-Reoxy treatment and ubiquitinated proteins were determined as indicated above. Heat shock was carried out at 42°C for 1 h, followed by 37°C
overnight. The blots were representative of three independent experiments. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01.

showed that inhibition of HSP70 synthesis by KNK437 or silencing of HSP70 gene by HSP70-shRNA signiﬁcantly attenuated the protection of Z-ligustilide. The results demonstrated
that HSP70 protein may play a critical role in this Z-ligustilide
mediated protective process. In addition, inhibitors of MAPKs
also signiﬁcantly reduced the protection of Z-ligustilide
against OGD-Reoxy induced cell death. These results indicate
that transient activation of MAPKs may be a key regulator
during the induction of HSP70 and ensuing cell protection by
Z-ligustilide.
Recent study demonstrated that overproduction of damaged proteins following focal cerebral ischemia increases
protein ubiquitination, resulting in ubiquitinated proteins
aggregation.36) Brain ischemia also damages protein degradation pathways, causing the accumulation of ubiquitinated
proteins.37) In this study, we also discovered that Z-ligustilide
reduced the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins induced by
both MG132 and OGD-Reoxy and provided the evidence that
blocking protein aggregation may be an important mechanism
for the protection of Z-ligustilide against OGD-Reoxy induced
injury. Importantly, HSP70 induction played a key role during
this process.
In conclusion, Z-ligustilide via intranasal administration
protected brain injury caused by transient MCAO in rats.

Additionally, Z-ligustilide protected PC12 cells against OGDReoxy induced both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Transient
activation of MAPKs is linked to induction of HSP70 by Zligustilide. Moreover, inhibition of HSP70 and MAPKs lead
to PC12 cells vulnerable to cell death induced by OGD-Reoxy.
Finally, Z-ligustilide reduced the accumulation of ubiquitinated
proteins by proteasome inhibitor MG132 and OGD-Reoxy,
which was eliminated through knockdown of HSP70. Together,
our research suggests that Z-ligustilide may activate endogenous HSP70 against OGD-Reoxy induced damage via noncanonical activation of MAPKs. In our future study, we will
further investigate the protective effect of Z-ligustilide on the
neurovascular unit against brain injury in the in vivo model and
the effect of inhibition of HSP70 up-regulation on this process.
