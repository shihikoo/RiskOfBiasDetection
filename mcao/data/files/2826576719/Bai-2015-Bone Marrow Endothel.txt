SUMMARY
Aims: We tested the hypothesis that endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-mediated functional
recovery after stroke may be associated with the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway. Methods: Mice were infused
with either EPCs or saline after being subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. The
EPC-treated mice also received intravenous injections of either Nx-nitro-L-arginine methyl
ester (L-NAME, the NOS inhibitor) or saline. Results: The activation of eNOS and the
expression of BDNF were significantly increased in ischemic brain of the EPC-treated mice,
along with increased angiogenesis and neurogenesis. On diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), significant increases in fractional anisotropy and fiber count were observed in white matter,
indicating axonal growth stimulated by EPCs. However, the EPC-treated mice that were
received an L-NAME injection failed to exhibit the observed increases in angiogenesis,
neurogenesis, and axonal growth. In addition, the neurons cocultured with EPCs in vitro
exhibited the increased expression of BDNF and decreased apoptosis after oxygen–glucose
deprivation compared with the control group. This EPC-induced protective effect was virtually absent in the L-NAME treatment group. Conclusion: The eNOS/BDNF pathway may
be involved in the EPC-mediated functional recovery of stroke mice. DTI is feasible for
dynamically tracking the orientation of axonal projections after EPC treatment.

Introduction
Despite scientific advances, stroke remains a leading cause of disability and death worldwide [1]. Accordingly, a novel treatment
that may be effective beyond the acute 4.5-h time window after
stroke onset will benefit patients in the clinical setting [2,3]. Cellbased therapy for ischemic stroke has recently been introduced in
the clinical setting [4–7]. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may
be used as markers of stroke outcomes [8]. EPCs isolated from the
bone marrow [9], peripheral blood [10], and cord blood [11,12]
have exhibited potential for neovascularization, which improving
functional recovery from ischemic stroke in animal models.
To date, no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have
assessed structural changes after EPC transplantation in animal
models of cerebral ischemia. Fractional anisotropy (FA) generated
from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely applied to
noninvasively detect the architectural organization of white matter [13,14]. The diffusion anisotropy of water may be observed
before the onset of myelination [15]. Moreover, the density and
orientation of axonal fibers may also be visualized by fiber tractography. In this study, we used FA and fiber tractography to assess

structural changes in the white matter of stroke mice after EPC
transplantation.
The mechanism of EPC-mediated brain regeneration remains
unclear. It has been reported that EPC transplantation improves
cardiac function after myocardial infarction, a process mediated
by the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) [16].
eNOS plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles
in the cerebrovascular and cardiovascular systems. Nitric oxide
produced by eNOS plays a critical role in the regulation of cerebral
blood flow, angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling [17,18]. Moreover, previous studies have also demonstrated that the activation
of eNOS in the brain tissue influences the migration of neurons,
the outgrowth of neurites, the proliferation of progenitor cells,
and neurological outcome after stroke via the upregulation of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression [19–21].
Based on these observations, eNOS may be an important regulator
of BDNF expression in the ischemic brain when stimulated by
EPC transplantation.
In this study, we used MR-DTI to assess changes in white matter
integrity after EPC transplantation and to investigate whether the
regulation of eNOS is a crucial determinant in the EPC-associated

induction of BDNF and the functional recovery of mice after
ischemic stroke using an inhibitor of NOS, Nx-nitro-L-arginine
methyl ester (L-NAME).

Materials and Methods
Cell Cultures
Endothelial progenitor cells isolated from the bone marrow
mononuclear cells of 5-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (Academy of
Military Medical Science, Beijing, China) were cultured in growth
factor-supplemented Endothelial Basal Media-2 (EBM-2; Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland) via Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. The
cultured cells were characterized using immunofluorescence staining of EPC-specific markers (CD133, CD34, and VEGFR2; Abcam,
Hong Kong, China) and double staining with dil-acetylated lowdensity lipoprotein (Dil-acLDL; Life Technologies, Grand Island,
Grand Island, NY, USA) and FITC-Ulex europaeus agglutinin
(FITC-UEA; Life Technologies) on day 14 (Figure S1A,B). The purity of EPCs isolated from BM was approximately 80% [22].
The neurons were dissected from D1 mouse hippocampi
(C57BL/6; Academy of Military Medical Science) as previously
reported [22–24]. The cells were grown in neurobasal media
(Gibco, Burlington, ON, Canada) and characterized using a tubulin stain (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) (Figure S1C). On
day 5, the neurons were either cocultured with or cultured
without EPCs for 24 h (100,000 EPCs per well with 1,000,000
neurons) after being subjected to a 2-h oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) as previously described [24]. L-NAME (1 lM; SigmaAldrich) and BDNF (100 ng/mL; Peprotech, Princeton, NJ, USA)
were also added to the culture media when the neurons were
co-cultured with EPCs.

Animal Model and Experimental Protocol
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the
Guidelines for Animal Care and Use established by Medical School
of Southeast University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the
Ethics of Animal Experiments of Medical School of Southeast
University. Male C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old; Academy of Military Medical Science) were anesthetized with 1% isoflurane
(KeYuan, Shandong, China) in an oxygen/air mixture using an
anesthetic mask. The animals’ body temperature and respiratory
rate were monitored using a physiological monitoring unit (Model
1025; SA Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY, USA) throughout
the experiments, including during the surgery and the MRI scans.
Right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced via
a photochemical reaction [25]. Under an operating microscope,
an incision was made between the orbit and the ear. The right lateral aspect of the skull was exposed after separating the temporalis
muscle. The middle cerebral artery was visualized under the skull.
A laser beam (Shanghai Laser & Optics Century Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) with a diameter of 0.1 mm and a wavelength of
532 nm was stereotactically focused onto the middle cerebral
artery for 2 min after rose bengal injection (iv., 50 mg/kg; Sigma,
St Louis, MO, USA). Thereafter, the skin was sutured and ischemia was verified via T2-weighted imaging 24 h after surgery.

The in vivo experimental groups included the following:
group 1, sham controls subjected to laser irradiation but not
administered rose bengal (n = 23); group 2, mice subjected to
MCAO and saline infusion (n = 22); group 3, mice subjected
to MCAO and EPC infusion (n = 22); and group 4, mice subjected to MCAO, EPC infusion, and L-NAME injection
(n = 22). Either pure saline or 1,000,000 EPCs in 100 lL of
saline was randomly infused into the mice from groups 2, 3,
and 4 at 24 h postischemia via the ipsilateral internal carotid
artery. A dose of 30 mg/kg of L-NAME [26] was intravenously
injected 30 min before the start of the EPC infusion into the
mice from group 4.

MRI Measurements
MRI scans were performed using a 7-T small animal MR scanner
(Bruker PharmaScan, Ettlingen, Germany). T2-weighted imaging
was acquired using a fast spin echo sequence (repetition time/echo
time, 3000/36 msecond, 4 average). A total of 12 axial slices with a
field of view of 20 9 20 mm, a matrix of 256 9 256, and a slice
thickness of 1 mm were positioned over the brain. The infarct volume measured from the T2-weighted images using the program NIH
ImageJ was divided by the volume of the contralateral hemisphere.
In vivo DTI was performed on day 21 postischemia. An echo
planar imaging sequence was used to acquire 30 distinct diffusion
directions and five reference images (repetition time/echo time of
5,000/32.2 msecond, b-value of 1000 s/mm2, field of view of
16 9 16 mm, matrix of 128 9 128, slice thickness of 0.6 mm,
20 slices). The ParaVision 5.0 software was used (Bruker PharmaScan MRI); the FA was derived from the tensor map. Regions
of interest were delimited on direction-encoded color maps in the
internal capsule (IC) of the brain. Fiber tracking was performed
using the TrackVis (version 0.5.2.1; Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA) and Diffusion Toolkit (version 0.6.2.1; Massachusetts General Hospital) software.

Behavioral Tests
Behavioral tests including the modified neurological severity score
(mNSS) and the foot-fault test were used. These tests were performed prior to MCAO and on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 after MCAO
by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups [22,27].

Histology
On days 7 and 21 after MCAO, the animal brains were embedded
in paraffin or optimum cutting temperature compound (OCT).
Immunohistochemical staining was carried out for doublecortin
(Dcx), NeuN, and myelin basic protein (MBP) as previously
described [19]. Optical density was measured using the Image-Pro
Plus software.
A terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) assay was performed using an In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit Fluorescein (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) to measure
neuronal cell death. The brain sections and cultured neurons were
also incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-BDNF, mouse
anti-NeuN, goat anti-GFAP; Abcam), followed by staining with
secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa

ª 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Y.-Y. Bai et al.

Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 donkey antigoat IgG; Life Technologies).
Fluorescein-labeled lycopersicon esculentum lectin (Vector
Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) was diluted 1:1 with saline, and
200 lL was intravenously injected into the mouse models 5 min
before death [28]. To obtain sections for histology, the brains were
harvested and cut into 20-lm sections on a freezing microtome.
Three random brain coronal sections from each mouse were chosen for microvessel counting. The numbers of microvessels within
the peri-infarct region were obtained from six mice per group.
Only vessels with a clearly defined lumen or a well-defined linear
vessel shape were considered [29]. This quantification was performed by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups.

Statistical Analysis
The data are presented as means  standard deviations (SDs). All
statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software, version 18.0. The data were tested for distribution normality and
variance homogeneity. The MRI data and histology results were
analyzed using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni tests,
and the behavioral data were analyzed using repeated-measures
ANOVA with post hoc least significant difference (LSD) tests.
P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Neurological Deficits and Lesion Volume

Western Blotting
Equal amounts of protein obtained from the right hemisphere of
mice from various groups on day 7 were used for the Western blotting analysis [22]. The following primary antibodies were used:
anti-eNOS (1:1,000; Abcam), anti-p-eNOS (1:1,000; Abcam), antiBDNF (1:1000; Abcam), and anti-b-actin (1:2000; Abcam).

The mortality rate of the mice subjected to MCAO was approximately 20%, and the dead animals were excluded from the experiments. Neurological functional deficits were significantly
attenuated in the EPC-treated mice according to the mNSS
(Figure 1A) and the foot-fault test (Figure 1B), beginning on day
7 after MCAO, compared with the saline-treated mice. Moreover,

the functional improvement induced by EPCs was blocked by pretreatment with L-NAME, an inhibitor of NOS (Figure 1A,B).
T2-weighted imaging was used to examine the effect of EPCs on
the infarct volume of the ipsilesional hemisphere. EPC
transplantation reduced the ischemia-induced loss of ipsilesional
hemispheric volume, whereas EPC infusion with L-NAME
pretreatment did not cause significant infarct volume decreases
compared with the saline infusion (Figure 1C,D).

Decreased Angiogenesis After Injection of
L-NAME
The treatment with EPCs initiated 24 h after MCAO significantly
increased the perfused capillary density (Figure 2) in the periinfarct region (Figure 2A) on day 7 after MCAO compared with
saline treatment. However, this EPC-induced angiogenesis was
decreased by an injection of L-NAME (Figure 2).

Decreased Neurogenesis and Neuronal Survival
After Injection of L-NAME
Neurogenesis was assessed by counting the number of Dcx+
cells (indicating migrating neuroblasts) in the subventricular
zone (SVZ) on day 7 after injury. The EPC infusion significantly
increased the migration of endogenous SVZ neural progenitor
cells compared with the saline infusion (Figure 3A,B). Meanwhile, the EPC infusion significantly increased the number of
neurons (Figure 3C) and reduced the number of TUNEL+ apoptotic cells (Figure 3D) in the peri-infarct region of mice on day
7 compared with saline treatment, suggesting that EPC transplantation improves neuron survival. To determine whether
eNOS regulates EPC-mediated neurogenesis and neuronal survival, L-NAME was administered. Our data demonstrated that
the additional injection of L-NAME significantly decreased the
migration of neural progenitor cells in the SVZ and the survival

of neurons in the peri-infarct region of the mice infused with
EPCs (Figure 3).

Decreased Axon Remodeling After Injection of
L-NAME
An in vivo DTI analysis demonstrated that EPC treatment increased
FA in the ipsilesional IC on day 21 compared with saline treatment (Figure 4A,B). The fiber count in the IC of the EPC-treated
mice was significantly higher than that of saline-treated mice (Figure 4C,D). MBP+ fiber coherence was significantly increased
within regions of the IC in the EPC-treated mice compared with
the saline-treated controls on day 21 (Figures 4E,F). These results
indicate that EPC treatment increases ischemia-induced axonal

rewiring. However, the FA, fiber counts, and myelination in the
IC of EPC-treated mice were significantly reduced when pretreatment with L-NAME was performed (Figure 4), suggesting that
EPC-induced axon remodeling may be mediated by eNOS.

Decreased Expression of BDNF in the Ischemic
Brain After Injection of L-NAME
BDNF is critical to the survival of neurons, neurogenesis, and
functional recovery after brain injury [30]. To confirm the inhibition of eNOS and to investigate whether the functional recovery
promoted by the EPCs was mediated by eNOS/BDNF, a Western
blotting analysis was performed. The results indicated that the
EPC infusion significantly increased both the activation of eNOS

(Figure 5A) and the expression of BDNF and VEGF (Figure 5B) in
right hemisphere of mice. Furthermore, the increased expression
of BDNF but not VEGF was reversed by an additional injection of
L-NAME (Figure 5A,B). Moreover, BDNF was observed to be primarily secreted by neurons rather than astrocytes in the peri-infarct region stimulated by EPC transplantation (Figure 5C). This
EPC-induced secretion of BDNF was reduced by the administration of L-NAME (Figure 5C).

In vitro Coculture of Neurons with EPCs
The neurons exposed to OGD and subsequently cocultured with
EPCs exhibited a significant increase in the secretion of BDNF
(Figure 6A,B) and a significant reduction in apoptosis compared
with the neurons without EPCs after OGD (Figure 6C,D). This
protective action of EPCs was attenuated by the addition of
L-NAME but then restored by the addition of BDNF to the media
(Figure 6).

Discussion
We observed that the delivered EPCs reduced infarct volume and
neurobehavioral scores and increased FA values in the ipsilateral

IC as measured by DTI. EPC transplantation upregulated both the
activation of eNOS and the expression of BDNF. Our data demonstrated that blocking eNOS largely abolished the BDNF-induced
neuroprotection stimulated by the EPCs, and the complementary
in vitro data demonstrated the crucial role of eNOS/BDNF in EPCinduced brain protection.
Diffusion tensor imaging has been used to evaluate white matter damage in patients and animals with ischemic stroke [31,32].
However, no studies have used DTI to monitor the therapeutic
reorganization of white matter after EPC transplantation. IC is the
most important type of white matter in the brain [33]. Motor
axons form a tract running from the ipsilateral cortex, passing the
ipsilateral IC and progressing toward the contralateral spinal cord.
FA is related directly to histological markers of myelination
[34,35]. Increases in FA correlate with white matter tract integrity, whereas reductions in FA correlate with functional deficits
[32,34,36]. Based on our DTI data, FA values were decreased in
the ipsilateral IC after ischemia, indicating a loss of axonal integrity. EPC treatment increased FA values in the ipsilateral IC of
ischemic mice, which were subsequently decreased by an additional injection of L-NAME. DTI fiber tracking exhibited higher
fiber counts and revealed that the orientation of the axonal projections in the EPC-treated mouse brain was reorganized 3 weeks

Figure 5 Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) treatment promotes the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and expression of brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on day 7 in the ischemic brain; however, these effects are not maintained after pretreatment with Nx-nitro-L-arginine methyl
ester (L-NAME). Western blot analyses of the activation of eNOS (A) and the expression of BDNF and VEGF (B) in the ischemic brains of mice in various
groups (n = 3/group). (C) Immunofluorescence staining revealed that only a few BDNF-positive cells (red) were colabeled with GFAP (green) and that most

after stroke. Therefore, we demonstrated that DTI can be used to
track the orientation of axonal projections dynamically and to
evaluate the density of the fiber tracts in mice after stroke.
The current therapy for ischemic stroke targets macrovascular
recanalization to restore the cerebral blood flow (such as thrombolytic therapy) and has a narrow treatment window. However,
endogenous angiogenesis that is microvessels from preexisting
vessels contributes to the formation of collateral circulation. After
the 4.5-h time window of stroke onset, angiogenesis can create a
microenviroment in which successful recovery may ensue. EPCbased therapy may amplify these endogenous restorative effects.
Previous studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of
EPCs in numerous vascular diseases [9,10,16,37]. Although
endogenous EPCs may be recruited into ischemic tissue, the

ª 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

decreased number of EPCs in the peripheral blood of stroke
patients may be insufficient for tissue repair [8]. Therefore, transplanting exogenous EPCs is an effective method for providing sufficient EPCs to participate in the repair of brain tissue. Previous
studies have demonstrated that injected EPCs could home to local
injured brain tissue and facilitate angiogenesis after stroke
[9,10,12]. We further investigated the mechanisms underlying
the EPC-induced protective effects in the current study using the
NOS inhibitor L-NAME. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase, which
was demonstrated to induce vascular protection after EPC transplantation [38], exerts multiple effects on the vasodilation of cerebral vessels and blood flow [18]. The endothelium-derived nitric
oxide produced by eNOS plays a crucial role in the regulation of
vascular function and is a downstream mediator of the responses

Figure 6 Neurons cocultured with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in vitro exhibited increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression
and decreased apoptosis after being exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD). BDNF and NeuN double staining (A) and quantitative data (B)
revealed that the BDNF expression induced by the EPCs was attenuated by adding Nx-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, n = 6/group). Terminal
transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining (C) and quantitative data (D) also showed that the reduced apoptosis induced by EPC failed
to persist when L-NAME was also administered, whereas protection was restored if additional BDNF was added to the media (n = 8/group). Scale

to several growth factors. The inhibition of eNOS blocks the
migration and proliferation of endothelial cells [19]. In the present
study, the increase in VEGF after EPC transplantation was not
affected by the additional injection of L-NAME; however, angiogenesis in the peri-infarct region was inhibited by L-NAME, indicating that the activation of eNOS is the intermediate process
between the release of pro-angiogenic factors from EPCs and the
induction of angiogenesis (Figure S2).
Previous studies have also shown that administering EPCs after
stroke enhances endogenous neurogenesis and improves neurological outcome via the acceleration of neovessel formation [11].
The mechanisms underlying this relationship might include making the ischemic tissue more suitable for neuronal regeneration by
facilitating the removal of toxic products and enhancing the production of chemokines and trophic agents by the neovasculature.

884

CNS Neuroscience & Therapeutics 21 (2015) 877–886

BDNF, which may be one of the factors involved, promotes the
proliferation, differentiation, and recruitment of neural progenitor
cells and amplifies axonal growth and synaptic plasticity after
stroke [39,40]. In the current study, BDNF was demonstrated to
be highly expressed in the right hemisphere of the mice treated
with EPCs and was associated with improved functional recovery.
Furthermore, the BDNF stimulated by EPC treatment was secreted
primarily by neurons in this study. Combined with the results of
previous studies performed by other groups [16,19–21], we have
inferred that neovascularization in response to the administration
of EPCs induces neurogenesis and axonal growth by providing the
necessary supportive environment, including BDNF (Figure S2).
The expression of BDNF would be expected to be downregulated
when EPC-induced angiogenesis is blocked by an additional injection of L-NAME. This hypothesis was supported by the findings of

the present study. The mice treated with EPCs in combination with
L-NAME exhibited decreased BDNF expression and reduced neurogenesis and axonal growth after stroke compared with the mice
treated with only EPCs. Moreover, the neurons treated with OGD
were used to study the in vitro simulation of the ischemic environment. These in vitro results further confirmed the hypothesis. The
findings of this study imply that in patients with dysfunctional
eNOS, treatment with EPCs may not have beneficial effects.
There were several limitations to this study. L-NAME is a nonspecific NOS inhibitor. Accumulating evidence suggests that both
induced NOS and neuronal NOS exert detrimental effects on neurons, whereas only eNOS exerts beneficial effects in the setting of
cerebral ischemia [41]. The inhibition of induced NOS and neuronal NOS may exert neuroprotective effects, which may interfere
with the negative effects exerted by the inhibition of eNOS.
Despite the nonspecific inhibition, we obtained fairly satisfactory
results. In the future, we will use eNOS / mouse models to
uncover additional evidence of eNOS-mediated neuroprotection
after EPC transplantation.

Conclusions
In summary, our data provide evidence that eNOS/BDNF plays
a crucial role in processes underlying microvessel angiogenesis,

neurogenesis, and axonal remodeling. We have demonstrated
that EPC therapy potentiates the secretion of BDNF from neurons in ischemic brain tissue, which may partially explain
their ability to promote functional recovery. These data
strongly suggest that EPC treatment may be an effective
means of enhancing neuronal regeneration and functional
recovery after stroke. DTI may be used to track the orientation
of axonal projections dynamically and to evaluate the density
of the fiber tracts in mice with cerebral ischemia after EPC
transplantation.
