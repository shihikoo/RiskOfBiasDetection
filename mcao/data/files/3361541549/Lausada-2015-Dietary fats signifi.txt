Objective: Brain stroke is the third most important cause of death in developed countries. We studied
the effect of different dietary lipids on the outcome of a permanent ischemic stroke rat model.
Methods: Wistar rats were fed diets containing 7% commercial oils (S, soybean; O, olive; C, coconut;
G, grape seed) for 35 d. Stroke was induced by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. Coronal
slices from ischemic brains and sham-operated animals were supravitally stained. Penumbra and
core volumes were calculated by image digitalization after 24, 48, and 72 h poststroke. Homogenates
and mitochondrial fractions were prepared from different zones and analyzed by redox status, inﬂammatory markers, ceramide, and arachidonate content, phospholipase A2, NOS, and proteases.
Results: Soybean (S) and G diets were mainly prooxidative and proinﬂammatory by increasing the
liberation of arachidonate and its transformation into prostaglandins. O was protective in terms of
redox homeostatic balance, minor increases in lipid and protein damage, conservation of reduced
glutathione, protective activation of NOS in penumbra, and net ratio of anti-to proinﬂammatory cytokines. Apoptosis (caspase-3, milli- and microcalpains) was less activated by O than by any other diet.
Conclusion: Dietary lipids modulate NOS and PLA2 activities, ceramide production, and glutathione
import into the mitochondrial matrix, ﬁnally determining the activation of the two main protease
systems involved in programmed cell death. Olive oil appears to be a biological source for the isolation
of protective agents that block the expansion of brain core at the expense of penumbral neurons.

Brain stroke is the third leading cause of death in developed
countries, behind cancer and heart disease [1]. Cerebral ischemia
generally results in immense distress and residual impairments
to patients, and is viewed as one of the leading causes of

decreased quality of life. In humans, ischemic stroke approximately accounts for 90% of all strokes and specially affects the
territory of the middle cerebral artery [2]. Cerebral stroke is one
of the diseases primarily linked to nutritional factors [1].
Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) is the model
most used worldwide experimental to induce stroke in rats, and it
is has been proven as an effective and reproducible tool for the
investigation of neuroprotective drugs as it closely resembles
stroke injury in human patients [2]. Cerebral ischemia has been
considered as untreatable pathology with no effective therapeutic
protocols [1]. Human ischemic stroke is heterogeneous in its
manifestations, causes, and anatomic sites of occurrence. Consequently, a wide variety of animal models have been developed to
assess stroke-related pathologies to ﬁnd better approaches to the
study of neuronal injury, especially the recruitment of neurons
from the surrounding tissues (penumbral zone or region) into
ischemic core [1]. So far, it is known that there is a relatively short
window of opportunity during which a population of penumbral
neurons remains viable for a variable number of hours following
stroke onset [3]. Thus, penumbra is deﬁned as a moderately
hypoperfused region that retains structural integrity but has lost
function [4,5]. Even with the implementation of therapeutic interventions this penumbra area will die and become recruited
into the core ischemic zone [5]. Only 2% of stroke patients receive
tissue plasminogen activator as thrombolytic agent [6]. The lack of
effective therapeutic agents establishes a high unmet medical
need for the development of stroke preventive strategies [7].
A number of previous studies have demonstrated that
oxidative stress [8–14] and inﬂammation [15–17] play a crucial
role in the pathogenesis of brain stroke [8,12,13]. These factors
strongly inﬂuence many other signals that converge into the
regulation of pro-apoptotic cascade [8,10,12,13], in which phospholipase A2 [18], production of prostaglandins and cytokines
[15–17], activation of nitric oxide synthethase activity [19–22],
and ceramide overproduction [23,24] are the most crucial events
affecting the ﬁnal result.
Previous statistical evidence and experimental results clearly
demonstrated that the quality and quantity of dietary fats and
fatty acids signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the incidence, prevalence, and
outcome of brain stroke and ischemic heart disease [25,26]. Fatty
acids may modulate inﬂammatory response [27,28], modify the
antioxidant status of many tissues [29–31], and regulate ceramide generation [32]. In addition, several studies have
conﬁrmed that other components of dietary fats such as polyphenols play an important role in the prevention of stroke and
cardiovascular illnesses or they attenuate the detrimental effects
caused by ischemia [33–41].
Based on previous evidence, we decided to investigate in
detail the inﬂuence of different types of commercial oils as dietary lipid source in relation to the outcome of ischemic stroke in
a MCAO rat model from 24 to 72 h poststroke by determining: 1)
the redox status (antioxidant enzymes and levels of lipid-soluble
and water-soluble antioxidants), 2) the inﬂammatory response
(prostaglandin and cytokine production), 3) activity of phospholipase A2 and nitric oxide synthetase isoforms, 4) production
of ceramide, and 5) activation of cellular death cascades (caspase-3 and milli- and microcalpains) to contribute with

experimental evidence that supports nutritional recommendation for the prevention of damages produced by brain stroke.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
All chemicals used were of analytical grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA), Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), or Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy).
Dietary commercial oils were from Molinos Rıo de La Plata SAIC and Platafarm SA
(La Plata, Argentina).
Animals and treatments
Certiﬁed pathogen-free male Wistar rats were used. The rats were maintained under controlled temperature conditions (25 C) with relative humidity of
60%, forced ventilation and a normal photoperiod of 12 h darkness and 12 h light.
Animals were handled in accordance with the internationally recommended
practices of the ILAR (Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, Commission of
Life Sciences, National Research Council) and the National Institutes of Health
regulations [42]. Solid food and drinking water were provided ad libitum. The
experimental diets were prepared in our laboratory according to the recommendations for Wistar rats [43]. The experimental protocol was reviewed and
approved by the Bioethics Committee of the School of Medical Sciences; UNLP
(COBIMED, protocol code # 00382/11). Male Wistar pups (three weeks old,
weight 48  3 g) were used. Animals were ramdomly asigned to four experimental groups (12 animals for each experiment) and after weaning were fed on
speciﬁc diets for 35 d. The diets used were supplemented with a different oil as
lipid source: soybean (S), olive (O), cocconut (C), or grape-seed (G). During the
feeding period clinical examination, body weight, foot intake, and water consumption were controlled daily [44]. All isocaloric diets were prepared in identical manner with the addition of one of the different commercial oils (70 g/kg
diet) as detailed previously [30,31]. General composition and fatty acid composition of the diets were reported in detail in previous papers [30,31].
Surgical procedure
To avoid individual differences among animals, the experiments were run
under equivalent conditions. On day 35 all rats fasted overnight with free access
to water, and the surgical procedure was implemented at 0800 h. Anesthesia was
conducted as recomended elsewhere [45]. Feedback-controlled heating lamp and
pad were used to maintain animal temperature at 37 C. Stroke was induced by
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO) following the procedure of Longa et al. [46]. None of the animals experimented subarachnoid
hemorraghe. This rat model of permanent ischemia is the most commonly used
due to many reasons, including up to two-week survival poststroke, high
reproducibility (involving frontoparietal cortex and lateral caudoputamen) and
its resemblance to humans in cerebrovascular anatomy and physiology [12,41,
47]. Transient occlusion is considered inappropriate for the replication of spontaneous or thromboslysis-induced stroke [2,48].
Obtaining samples
We performed different sets of experiments. In one type, after various times
poststroke (24, 48, and 72 h) rats were sacriﬁced by rapid decapitation without
the use of anesthesia. To obtain plasma samples, blood was collected into heparinized (10 mUI/mL) sterile polystyrene test tubes and centrifuged at 2 C, 1000 g
for 15 min. The brains were excised, cleaned, weighed and frozen for 5 min at
–20 C. Coronal slices of 1 mm were performed beginning at 2 mm from the
anterior tip of the frontal lobe. Sections were immersed in 2% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTZ) at 37 C for 20 min with gentle orbital
agitation. Slices were photographed and analyzed using the Software Erdas Imtica, Buenos Aires, Argentina) that can digitalize and
age v8.0 (Infosat Geoma
quantify infarct area, penumbra, and undamage hemisphere (contralateral). After
digitalization was complete, image analysis was compiled to obtain stroke core,
penumbral zone and undamaged tissue volumes in mm3. Sham-operated animals were also run as reference. In all cases, the values obtained were corrected
by edema using the following fomula [8]:

½total infarct volume  ðvolume of intact ipsilateral hemisphere  volume of intact contralateral hemipshereÞ
ðcontralateral hemisphere volumeÞ  100

1432

N. Lausada et al. / Nutrition 31 (2015) 1430–1442

In other types of experiments we dissected the core of the infarct zone from
the penumbra using the methodology described elsewhere [24]. Tissues from
contralateral hemipshere and sham-operated animals were also taken. From
these biological materials we prepared whole homogenates using HEPES 50 mM
pH 7.4 with CHAPS 5 mM, dithiothreitol 5 mM and aprotinin 10 mg/mL, in a
proportion of 6 mL buffer to each 100 mg tissue. Crude mitochondrial suspensions were also prepared using a two-step centrifugation (600 g/11.000 g)
method following the procedure described elsewhere [5]. For lipid analysis and
glutathione content mitochondrial suspensions were previously sonicated on ice
(three 45-sec bursts at 50% output in a Heat Systems Ultrasonic Sonicator, model
W-220, Plainview, NY, USA).
Analytical methods
Biomarkers of ROS production
Markers of ROS-induced damage were determined according to classical
methodologies. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) were measured
in brain homogenates as previously described [49]. TBARS (mainly malondialdehyde [MDA]) were reacted with 2-thiobarbituric acid (TBA) to yield TBA–MDA
adducts and quantiﬁed at 532 nm. The concentration of the chromophore was
calculated from a calibration curve prepared with fresh tetramethoxypropane
solutions (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Small aliquots of total lipids extracts
(see later) were used to determine the spectral register of the conjugate diene
formation at 234 nm [50]. Nitrate and nitrite (NOx) concentrations were measured
using the method by Griess on samples previously reduced with vanadium
chlorohydrate [51]. Quantiﬁcation was performed after calibration with standard
solutions of sodium nitrate from Merck & Co. (Kenilworth, NJ, USA). Protein

carbonyls (PCs) were determined by the method by Reznick and Packer [52]. PC
concentrations were calculated from a calibration curve prepared with a stock
solution of sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich). DNA damage was assessed by
the classical electrophoretic methodology using 1% agarose gels and [2-(4Amidinophenyl)-1H-indole-6-carboxamidine] staining. After examination under
ultraviolet light (435 nm), gels were photographed and scanned with a CCD-L4
densitometer (Kinetic Imaging Ltd., Liverpool, UK) [25].
Antioxidant defense enzymes
The activity of catalase was determined using the method by Aebi [53]. K
values from the curves were electronically calculated using the equation k ¼
(2.30/t)  log (DOf–DOi). The speciﬁc activity of the enzyme was obtained
considering the concentration of proteins corresponding to each sample. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was determined using the method by Misra and Fridovich [54]. To calculate the activity of SOD in the samples we performed a
reaction without sample homogenate to obtain the rate of the auto-oxidation of
epinephrine. An enzymatic unit was deﬁned as the amount inhibiting 50% of
auto-oxidation. To obtain the speciﬁc activity of SOD the ratios between the
values of enzymatic units of each sample and the corresponding values of protein
concentration (mg/mL) were calculated. The activity of glutathione transferase
was determined by the method by Habig et al. [55]. The speciﬁc activity of the
enzyme was calculated for each sample in terms of nanomoles of product per
min/mg of total cellular protein, with ε ¼ 9.6 mM/cm (340 nm). Glutathione
 and Gunzler [56]. To calculate
peroxidase was determined by the method of Flohe
the enzymatic units (in terms of nanomoles of NADPH/min), ε ¼ 6.22 mM/cm
(340 nm) was considered. The speciﬁc activity was obtained as units of enzyme

activity/corresponding value of protein content (mg/mL). Glutathione reductase
was determined by the method by Carlberg and Mannervik [57]. The speciﬁc
activity of the enzyme was calculated for each sample in terms of micromoles of
product per min per mg protein, with ε ¼ 6.22 mM/cm (340 nm).

Antioxidant molecules
The levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were
determined by the glutathione reductase/dithio-nitrobenzoic method [58]. To
calculate the ratio, GSH/GSSG samples were reanalyzed after derivatization with
divinyl-pyridine (3 mM ﬁnal concentration). Aliquots for glutathione analyses
were immediately treated with equal volume of HClO4 (12% W/V) and N-ethylmaleimide (40 mM ﬁnal concentration) [59] to preserve the proportion between
oxidized and reduced glutathione. To calculate the ratio GSH/GSSG, samples were
reanalyzed after derivatization with divinyl-pyridine (3 mM ﬁnal concentration).
Vitamin E (a-tocopherol) and retinol concentrations were measured after extraction with the Buttriss and Diplock method [60] using a high-performance liquid
chromatography technique [61] with ultraviolet detection (results in pmol/mg
protein and nmol/mg protein, respectively). Ascorbate was determined in deferoxamine mesylate-treated samples by the method of Benzie [62]. Total antioxidant
reducing ability (FRAP ferric reducing ability of plasma [FRAP] assay) was
measured according to Benzie and Strain [63]. FRAP values were obtained by
comparing the change in absorbance at 593 nm (slope of the initial velocity
reaction from 0 to 2 min) in the test sample mixtures with standards containing
known concentrations of ferrous ions and expressed as mM of equivalent TROLOX
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland) or a-tocopheryldiacetate.

Total lipids were extracted [64] and quantiﬁed gravimetrically. The phospholipid fraction was separated from the extracts by a microcolumn chromatography method [65]. Aliquots of the organic extracts were evaporated and the
residue was dissolved in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing
digitonin 1%. These solutions were used to measure cholesterol (Cho) and
phospholipids (PL) using commercial kits from Wienner Lab Group (Rosario,
Argentina). Ceramide content was determined according to the method
described by Ohtani et al. [21] using the diacylglycerol-kinase assay that converts
ceramide into ceramide-1-phosphate by incubation with the enzyme and g32ATP. The incubation mixture was seeded on Silica Gel 60 TLP plates (Merck & Co.)
and developed with a solvent system including chloroform/acetone/methanol/
acetic acid/water (10:4:3:2:1, by volume). Ceramide was individualized by
comparison with a pure standard (Santa Cruz Product Block Biotechnology Inc.,
Dallas, TX, USA) and radio-densitometrically quantiﬁed (in a BAS-2000 TM equip,
Fuji, Japan). Results were expressed as mmol of palmitoyl-ceramide (molecular
weight: 537.9) per mg total lipids. Araquidonic acid content was determined by
capillary gas-liquid chromatography of the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Analyses were performed as indicated in a previous paper [66] using a capillary
column (Omegawax 250, Bellefonte, Supelco, PA, USA) mounted on a Hewlett
Packard HP 6890 Series GC System Plus (Avondale, PA, USA) equipped with a
terminal computer integrator and data station. The FAMEs were identiﬁed by
comparison of their relative retention times with authentic standards, and mass
distribution was calculated electronically by quantiﬁcation of peak areas. Eicosamonoenoic acid (21:0) was used as the internal standard.
Programmed cell death biomarkers
Caspase-3 activity was measured by a colorimetric assay kit (CASP-3-C),
based on the hydrolysis of the synthetic peptide substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-ValAsp-p-nitroaniline (Ac-DEVD-pNA) by caspase-3 (Sigma-Aldrich). The released
p-nitroaniline NA was monitored at 405 nm. Each assay was run in parallel with
inhibitor-treated cell lysate (to measure the non-speciﬁc hydrolysis of the substrate) and caspase-3 positive control (using commercial caspase-3, 5 mg/mL
provided by the kit manufacturer). A calibration curve using a standard solution
of p-nitroaniline was also run for each assay to calculate the protease activity
expressed as mmol p-NA released/min/mL of sample. The activities of milli- and
microcalpains were also measured. The technique involves the hydrolysis of
ultra-pure casein (Sigma-Aldrich) by calpain(s) and the subsequent detection of
trichloroacetic acid–soluble peptidic fragments at 280 nm [67]. To select the
activity of each calpain isoform, the level of calcium in the medium was regulated
(5 mM or 500 mM of CaCl2 for m- or m-calpain, respectively). The activities of
calpains were calculated considering a unit of calpain to be the amount of
enzyme that produces a change of absorbance of 0.01 at 280 nm. Results were
expressed as units/min per mg of protein.

Antioxidants and biomarkers of oxidative stress were determined in brain homogenates from rats fed the experimental diets supplemented with the commercial oils (S,
soybean; O, olive; C, coconut; G, grape seed). Data are presented as mean  SD of 4 independent experiments assayed in duplicate. Statistical differences among results
are indicated with distinct superscript letters (P < 0.01).

Inﬂammatory biomarkers and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities
Interleukins 1b (IL-1), 6 (IL-6) and 10 (IL-10) were measured using enzymelinked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) kits from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA),
IL-1 beta Mouse ELISA Kit (ab108866), IL-6 Mouse ELISA Kit (ab108868), and IL-10
Mouse ELISA Kit (ab108870), respectively (Abcam). Range of detection for the
cytokines were 0.12 to 20.3, 0.15 to 19.2, and 0.90 to 29.7 pg/mL, for IL-1, -6, and
-10; respectively (and intraassay coefﬁcient of variations were 9%). Prostaglandins
E2 and F2a were determined by ELISA method using two commercial kits, Prostaglandin E2 ELISA Kit (ab133021) (Abcam) and Prostaglandin F2 a EIA Kit #516011
(Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) with a range of detection of 11.1 to
345.5, and 0.15 to 366.8 ng/mg serum proteins (and intraassay coefﬁcient of variations were <11%). Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities were determined as
described by Hirata et al. [68] with the modiﬁcations detailed in our previous
paper [69]. The assays were conducted in the presence of Ca (total PLA2 activity)
and with EGTA 3 mM (i-inducible-PLA2). The isoform activity c-PLA2 was obtained
by subtraction. Results were expressed as nmol of released fatty acid/min per mg
protein with a linear range of detection between 0.5 to 74.0 mmol arachidonate
released/mg protein (and intraassay coefﬁcient of variations were <8%).

with a range of linear detection between 2.2 and 77.3 pmol/mg protein (and
intraassay coefﬁcient of variations were <12%).
Other determinations
Protein content was determined by the method by Lowry et al. [70]. Total
polyphenol content in oils was measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent
following the method described by Ali et al. [33]. Results were expressed as
caffeic acid (mg/kg oil).
Statistical analysis
All values represent the mean of four rats assayed in duplicate expressed as
mean  standard deviation (SD). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance
(ANOVA) plus the Tukey test with the aid of SPSS 12.0.1 software (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Differences in the variations of a parameter over time were
analyzed by two-way ANOVA including time as a measure. Results were also
plotted and analyzed using Sigma Scientiﬁc Graphing Software (version 12.0)
from Sigma-Aldrich. The statistical signiﬁcance (P  0.01) of differences is indicated by asterisks or letters, as appropriate.

Nitric oxide synthetase activities
NOS activities were determined as described by Zhu et al. [24] using a
commercial available kit (Juli Bioengineering Co., Nanjing, China) that is based on
the oxidation of oxyhemoglobin to metahemoglobin by NO. Ca-independent
(eNOS plus nNOS) and dependent (iNOS) were determined by subtracting Caindependent NOS activity from the total activity (the assay was run in the
presence of Ca or EGTA 3 mM). Results were expressed as pmol/min per mg prot.

Enzyme activities were determined in aliquots of total brain homogenates from
control rats fed under the four experimental diets supplemented with commercial oils (S, soybean; O, olive; C, coconut; G, grape seed). Methodology used
was described in the Research methods and procedures section (units of activities were consigned in the table). Each result is the mean  SD of four independent experiments assayed in duplicate. Statistical differences among the
results (ANOVA þ Tukey test) are indicated with different superscript letters
(P < 0.01).

Results
Stroke outcome
We obtained highly reproducible infarct zones with a clear
deﬁnition of core and penumbral zones. Figure 1 shows a
representative TTZ-stained coronal slide before and after the
digitalization procedure (Fig. 1A) and also comparative ischemic
zones for the same slide of brains obtained from the four
experimental diets (Fig. 1B). It is evident that the extension of the
damage decreases in the order G > S > C > O. Figure 2A clearly
demonstrates that the core volume (Cv) was signiﬁcantly minor
for O and increased with time after stroke (24 to 72 h) for all
treatments; however, the increment was lesser in the case of Ofeeding rats. Figure 1B shows that enumbral volume (Pv) was
also of lesser extension for O. Pv remained constant for S after
24 h poststroke and then decreased. For the rest of the diets, Pv
decreased with time. Pv/Pc ratio (Fig. 3) showed a linear decrease
as a function of time (0.97 < r2 < 0.99), being the velocities of
decrease (slope of the regression lines, 103) signiﬁcantly high
for C (–2.91), followed for S (–1.67) and G (–1.46), and ﬁnally by O
(–1.25). The ratio Pv/Pc for O was the lowest ratio observed.
Redox status, biomakers of damage, and NOS activities
Experimental diets profoundly inﬂuence both the levels of
antioxidants and the markers of oxidative damage in whole
homogenates obtained from non-ischemic brains (Table 1, basal

Ca-independent (iNOS) and Ca-dependent (nNOS plus eNOS) activities were determined in homogenates from sham operated animals and in core, penumbra, and
contralateral hemispheres (after different times poststroke) using a commercial kit as described in the Research methods and procedures section. Homogenates from the
experimental diets supplemented with commercial oils were indicated by capital letters (S, soybean; O, olive; C, coconut; G, grape seed). Statistical differences among
results (brain zones analyzed) from the same diet and time were identiﬁed with distinct superscript letters. Differences among results from the same type of homogenate and diet treatment associated to time poststroke (compared to 24 h) are indicated with asterisks (ANOVA plus Tukey test, P < 0.01).

GSH, reduced glutathione; GSSH, oxidized glutathione; MDA, malondialdehyde; NOx, nitrate plus nitrite; TBARS, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances.
Antioxidants and biomarkers of oxidative stress were determined in brain homogenates from rats fed on the experimental diets supplemented with the commercial oils (S,
soybean; O, olive; C, coconut; G, grape seed). Methods used for measurements were mentioned in Research methods and procedures section. Each result (units are indicated in
the table) is the mean  SD of 4 independent experiments assayed in duplicate. Statistical differences among data are indicated with distinct superscript letters (P < 0.01).

status). Homemade diets were prepared with a constant amount
of water- and lipid-soluble antioxidants (ascorbate, tocopherol);
however, the extra amount incorporated by the dietary oils was
signiﬁcantly different. Tocopherol contents in oils (mg/100 g)
were 2.1  0.1 (C) < 3.5  0.2 (S) ¼ 3.3  0.3 (G) < 13.8  0.3 (O).
The content of total polyphenols (expressed as caffeic acid; mg/
100 g) were: 1.7  0.1 (S) < 3.1  0.2 (C) < 4.0  0.2
(G) < 19.6  0.4 (O). Although ascorbate was higher in S and G
than in O and C, the content of tocopherol was higher (and
similar) in O and C. Retinol was more abundant in O-supplemented diet. The lowest value for GSSG content was observed for
O group and the highest GSSG/GSH ratio was measured for G
group. The FRAP assay, reﬂecting the total antioxidant capacity,
decreased in the order O ¼ C > S > G. The biomarkers for lipid
damage (peroxidation of fatty acyl chains) TBARS and conjugated
dienes were elevated, and almost similar, in S and G groups,
intermediate for O, and lower for C (enriched in saturated fatty
acids). The behavior of protein carbonyls (PCs) and nitrate plus
nitrite production (NOx) that estimates oxidative damage to
proteins and nitrative stress, respectively, was very similar to the
previously described.
Table 2 shows the results of the enzyme components of the
antioxidant defense system. Total SOD activity was elevated
compared to O and C groups. Olive-fed rats showed the lowest
values for the mitochondrial and cytosolic isoforms of SOD.
Glutathione reductase was very active in G group followed by
S > C > O. A similar pattern was observed for glutathione
peroxidase and catalase. Glutathione transferase showed no
signiﬁcant changes among groups.
We also studied the activities of the two main isoforms of the
nitric oxide synthethase (NOS) (Ca-independent and -dependent
forms, Table 3) after different poststroke times (24, 48, and 72 h).
In both isoforms, basal values varied signiﬁcantly among the
experimental groups; however, results for sham-operated rats
remain almost constant and very similar to those of the contralateral hemisphere. In core and penumbra of S and G groups
there was a sustained increment with time of the Caindependent isoform (iNOS). On the contrary, Ca-dependent
isoforms (eNOS and nNOS) decreased in all groups and in both
regions (core and penumbra). There was a slight increase at 48 h
poststroke for S group and a signiﬁcant time-dependent rise for
the O feeding rats. Due to the fact that 48 h poststroke seems to
involve particular changes in the behavior of NOS, we focused
our study on that time period poststroke. Tables 4 and 5 show
the results obtained for the non-enzymatic and enzymatic
antioxidant defense systems and biomarkers of oxidative damage (in core and penumbra) after 48 h poststroke, respectively.
We found a reduction of antioxidants (ascorbate, tocopherol and
retinol) in all groups (Table 4), which was noticeable in penumbra compared to core. Concomitantly, the proportion of GSSG
increased in core and penumbra in all groups except O. We also
observed an increment of the biomarkers of damage in core and
penumbra for all groups with the exception of NOx and PCs for O.
The activity of total SOD (Table 5) increased in all groups in core
and penumbra with the exception of C group. Interestingly, in O
and C groups the mitochondrial (Mn) SOD remains unaltered
with respect to reference values. The cytosolic form (Cu, Zn) of
SOD was also indistinguishable from control data. Except for C
group, the glutathione reductase was strongly stimulated in both
zones, especially in penumbra of O group. Glutathione peroxidase was only increased in S and G groups, whereas glutathione
transferase did not modify its activity in any group or zone.
Catalase was increased in S and G groups, had no changes in C
and was stimulated in penumbra of O.

G-Px, glutathione peroxidase; G-Re, glutathione reductase; G-Tr, glutathione
transferase; SOD, superoxide dismutase
Enzyme activities were determined in homogenates from sham operated animals
and in core, penumbra, and contralateral hemispheres (48 h poststroke) using the
methodologies mentioned in the Research methods and procedures section.
Homogenates from the experimental diets supplemented with commercial oils
were indicated by capital letters (S, soybean; O, olive; C, coconut; G, grape seed).
Statistical differences among results (brain zones analyzed) from the same diet
were identiﬁed with distinct superscript letters (ANOVA plus Tukey test, P < 0.01).

Analysis of DNA after 48 h poststroke demonstrated that S
and G diets generated extensive damage whereas C produced an
intermediate effect, and there is no evidence of damage in O
group (Fig. 4).
Lipid derived mediators
Oxidative stress is intimately linked to alterations in lipid
parameters (cytokines, prostaglandins, arachidonate, ratio
cholesterol/phospholipids, etc.) and enzymes of lipid metabolism (mainly phospholipase A2) that ﬁnally converge into proapoptotic signals. These parameters are therefore considered to
be “lipid mediators” of programmed cell death. For example,
there is a connection between the Cho/PL ratio in mitochondria
and the entry of GSH from the cytosol into the matrix. Table 6
shows that despite the differences in the basal values among
groups, the Cho/PL ratio increased in core and even more so in
penumbra with the exception of O rats. This was reﬂected in a
drastic increase in the GSSG/GSH ratio in mitochondria from the
core zone and an even more signiﬁcant increase in penumbra for
all groups except O (an approximate 50% change in O with
respect to control versus 93% to 162% for the other groups).
Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is activated under pro-oxidative
conditions and is involved in inﬂammatory response (via araquidonate release) and programmed cell death. We determine
the activities of the c- (Ca-dependent) and i-(Ca-independent)

PLA2 isoforms in core and penumbra (Fig. 5). c-PLA2 (Fig. 5A)
increased in both zones for S and G groups, remaining unaltered

increased signiﬁcantly in all groups, especially in the core of C.
The lowest observed values were those for O. i-PLA2 did not
change signiﬁcantly in penumbra from the O group.
Activation of PLA2 is likely associated with araquidonate
release. Contrary to our expectation (derived from the results
obtained for the PLA2 activities), after 48 h poststroke arachidonic acid content was reduced in core and penumbra from all
groups (especially S, C and G) (Fig. 6A). This reduction could be
associated with arachidonate transformation into prostaglandins, because prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin F2a
(PGF2a) increased in core and penumbra in accordance with the
previously observed reductions in arachidonate content (Fig. 6B

and C versus Fig. 6A). PGE2 showed similar increases in core and
penumbra for S, C, and G groups, but it was only augmented in
core from the O group. PGF2a characteristically showed more
pronounced increments in penumbra compared to core, except
for the O group, in which the increases were negligible (Fig. 6C).
Ceramide levels and programmed cell death
Liberation of arachidonate stimulates sphingomyelinases
causing production of ceramide. Also, oxidative stress induces
ceramide production. We observed that the levels of ceramide
in core remain similar to those of sham-operated rats or
contralateral hemisphere (Table 7). However, they increased
signiﬁcantly, in very different magnitudes, in penumbra from all
experimental groups. In percent change, compared to contralateral values, results were: S, 113  9.9; O, 31  2.8; C,
193  11.1; G, 243  15.4.
Caspase-3 activity (Fig. 7A) increased in the penumbra and in

Cytokine levels in peripheral plasma
Modiﬁcation of the quality of the fatty acyl chains in the dietary lipids profoundly inﬂuenced the concentration of cytokines
in peripheral plasma (Table 8). In sham-operated rats, olive oil
supplementation produced a signiﬁcant increase in the ratio
between anti- and proinﬂammatory interleukins. After 48 h
ischemia the changes observed in the group fed with olive oil
also have the best ratio among all groups studied (Table 8).

Discussion
We demonstrated a profound inﬂuence of dietary lipids
(commercial oils) on the evolution of brain stroke in a worldwide
accepted model of focal ischemia. Other authors have previously
reported the beneﬁcial effects of the Mediterranean diet
(enriched in olive oil) for the prevention of brain and cardiovascular diseases [25,26,40]. Moreover, it was reported the
improvement of brain stroke evolution with the administration
of curcumin [34,35], tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol [36,38], red
wine polyphenols [37], resveratrol [41], and other phenolic
compounds [39]. The biological effect of the polyphenols is
heterogeneous. For example, caffeinol confers cortical but not
subcortical protection after stroke [6]. The elevated concentration of polyphenols in the virgin olive oil employed compared to
the other commercial oils assayed has led us to assume that it is
in this unsaponiﬁable fraction that the protective effects resides.
In addition, if we consider the fatty acid composition of the oils,
we and other researchers have demonstrated that oxidative
stress is highly dependent on the unsaturation of the fatty acyl
chains [31]. The fatty acids of soybean and grape seed oils are
strong pro-oxidative inducers [29–31]. It is well recognized that
fatty acids (especially from the n-6 series) are cellular promoters
of oxidative stress and proinﬂammatory effects and that docosahexenoic and docosapentaenoic acids of the n-3 series could
be the only fatty acids with recognized antioxidant and neuroprotective properties [29,71]. Fatty acids can increase free radical
production through many mechanisms [29] and inﬂuence
signiﬁcantly on the proinﬂammatory routes [27,28]. In addition,

saturated fatty acids such as those present in coconut oil are
inducers of apoptosis by stimulation of ceramide generation and
activation of programmed death signals [32]. Olive-fed rats have

the best performance in the poststroke evolution, and they also
showed maintenance of redox homeostasis (antioxidant levels
and activities of enzymes of the antioxidant defense system),
with a simultaneous activation of the calcium-dependent NOS
(eNOS plus nNOs) activity in penumbra, which is neuroprotective
in opposition to iNOS (that actively generates peroxinitrite and
cellular damage) [23,24].
The olive group had the minor ceramide overproduction that
has been repeatedly associated to programmed cell death
[19–22], and the Cho/PL ratio was unaffected in penumbra, producing the lowest values for the GSSG/GSH ratio in mitochondrial
fraction isolated from this critical zone. We and other authors
have previously demonstrated that there is an inverse relationship between these two parameters [72–74] because an increased
Cho/PL ratio impairs the entry of GSH into the mitochondrial
matrix because of the effects on membrane structure and physiology that ﬁnally inhibits various GSH carriers [75]. The failure in
restoring mitochondrial GSH leads to accumulation of free radicals, mitochondrial membrane damage with loss of integrity (via
peroxidation of cardiolipin), and release of citochrome c to the
cytosol initiating the caspase-3 activation cascade [10,13,72–75].
Prostaglandin production was also lower in the olive oil supplemented group. This was directly reﬂected in the lesser
inﬂammation as demonstrated previously by other researches
[15–17]. The activity of PLA2 and the production of PGE2 and F2a
are key factors linked to the stroke outcome [16,17]. In addition,
PLA2 is responsible for initiating not only the proinﬂammatory
cascade, but also for the activation of ceramide production via
arachidonate [18]. Once activated, inﬂammatory cells can release
a variety of cytotoxic agents including more cytokines, matrix
metalloproteinases, nitric oxide, superoxide, and other oxygenated and nitrogenated free radicals [15–17]. In fact, cyclooxygenase pathway is one of the main targets for the palliative
treatment of stroke in humans [7,16], and IL determination in
peripheral blood is used for the prognosis of the stroke patients
[15,17]. The cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and IL-10) play a crucial role in the
outcome of ischemic stroke and they are strongly inﬂuenced by
the type of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids [27]. In the

1440

N. Lausada et al. / Nutrition 31 (2015) 1430–1442

presence of inﬂammation of glia, even low alterations of the redox
status can induce neuronal death under hypoxic conditions [11].
We observed that dietary lipid manipulation signiﬁcantly
modify the levels of cytokines. The best relationship between the
anti- (IL-10) and the proinﬂammatory interleukins (IL-1 and IL-6)
was achieved under olive oil dietary supplementation. It was previously reported that levels of IL-6 >13 pg/mL could predict
intrahospital mortality with a sensitivity of 85% and speciﬁcity of
93% [15]. Moreover, both Il-1 and IL-6 positively correlated with the
volume of infracted region in humans [11,15,16]. Previous research
from other labs have demonstrated lower levels of IL-10 in the
stroke patients with negative onset after stroke [16,17]. Thus, we
think that increased IL-1 and IL-6 and reduced IL-10 in those animals fed on diets other than olive oil-supplementation was associated to clinical deterioration. Thus, olive oil seems to stabilize the
inﬂammatory response. These ﬁndings reinforce the idea that peripheral measurement of cytokines should be useful for the prognosis of ischemic stroke [11,15–17] and, more importantly, that
these mediators can be modiﬁed by dietary lipid manipulation [27].
All the changes induced by the dietary fatty acyl composition
here demonstrated converge ﬁnally in the main and most

important fact which is the activation of the proteases involved
in cell survival. In acute ischemic stroke, it was suggested that
necrosis and apoptosis are both present in the core, whereas
apoptosis predominates in penumbral zone [12]. Inhibition of
caspase-3 (together with inﬂammation control) has become one
of the main palliative tools during the stroke outcome in humans
[1]. Thus, it is relevant to discuss the role of caspase-3 and calpain in this context. There is a consensus that free radicals, ceramide overproduction, and GSSG level are key factors in the
activation of protease systems [9,10,12,13,22,32]. However, the
question of how the programmed cell death is implemented
remains as continuous controversy. Previous experimental data
have demonstrated a complex interrelationship between the two
systems [76,77]. In fact, activation of one of these proteases may
lead to inactivation of the other; in other words, they function as
interdependent and exclusive effectors able to replace one
another during the programmed cell death cascade [78].
Taken together, our results justify the lower velocity of
recruitment of penumbral neurons into core observed for the
olive oil-fed rats, demonstrating the crucial inﬂuence that the
quality of dietary lipids has on the evolution of ischemic stroke.

Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the main effects of dietary lipids on various parameters that trigger the outcome of the ischemic stroke. The quality of the fatty acyl chains
can modify the production of radical species and also their type, being one of the factors that modulate antioxidant enzyme activities, water- and lipid-soluble scavenger
levels, and ultimately the damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins that interact with redox-dependent signaling cascades. Lipid metabolism is also altered through enzyme
changes and modiﬁcations in both the availability of fatty acyl chains as substrates via phospholipase A2 (PLA2) for prostaglandin biosynthesis or ceramide production.
Modiﬁcation in the ratio of cholesterol (Cho) to phospholipd (PL) inﬂuences the entry of reduced glutathione into the mitochondrial matrix. The levels of cytokines, together
with those of prostaglandins, determine the inﬂammation scenario that characterizes each type of experimental group. The balance between Ca-dependent and -independent nitric oxide synthethase (NOS) contribute to the modulation of redox signaling pathways, the formation of nitrogenated radical species, perfusion rate, and other
events linked to cell survival. All these changes ﬁnally determine the activities of the two main protease systems involved in programmed cell death (caspase-3 and milli/
microcalpain activities) and lead to differences in the recruitment of penumbral neurons into ischemic core.

N. Lausada et al. / Nutrition 31 (2015) 1430–1442

There are many possible speculations concerning the complex
relationship between the variables studied here investigated
that could explain our ﬁndings. Figure 8 presents a graphical
summary of these interdependencies. However, certain limitations to the conclusions of our study are acknowledged since we
do not know if the experimental conditions simulated in our rats
can be extrapolated to those associated with real human situations. Modern diets are enriched in saturated fats and in oils with
polyunsaturated fatty acids from the n-6 series (e.g., soybean oil
is the most consumed oil in many countries of Latin America).
Notwithstanding, the experimental evidence presented here
supports the recommendation to increase not only the n-3
derived fatty acids [71,79] but also the ingestion of virgin olive oil
as a preventive resource for ischemic brain damage. Another
important derivation is that further investigation should be
focused on the isolation and development of bioactive compounds (nutraceuticals) likely present in the unsaponiﬁable
fraction of olive oils that could have important connotations
from the pharmaceutical point of view. This is in line with the
promising epidemiological, experimental, and clinical evidence
emerging from the use of resveratrol [41] and tyrosol [36,38].
Conclusion
Dietary fats profoundly inﬂuence the oxidative status of the
brain and the inﬂammatory response to ischemic injury by
modulating the activities of NOS and PLA2 activities, interleukin
and prostaglandin production, ceramide concentration, and
glutathione import into the mitochondrial matrix. These effects
ﬁnally determine the activation of the two main protease systems involved in programmed cell death (caspase-3 and calpains). Olive oil seems to be a biological source for the isolation
of highly protective agents that block expansion of brain core at
the expense of penumbral neurons after ischemic stroke.
