Introduction

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is effective if administered within 3–4.5 h after the onset of stroke (Hacke et al.,
1999; Park et al., 2014). However, its use is limited in patients
with ischemic stroke because of the narrow therapeutic time
window available for safe and effective therapy (Marler and
Goldstein, 2003; Saver and Levine, 2010), beyond which tPA
may increase the incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage and
further brain injury (Wardlaw et al., 2003; García-Yébenes
et al., 2011). The majority of ischemic stroke patients currently do not present within the appropriate therapeutic time
window after onset of stroke and cannot be treated by tPA
(Kleindorfer et al., 2008). Therefore, strategies to minimize the
risk of hemorrhage will have a major impact on improving
the outcomes in ischemic stroke patients.
ADAMTS13, a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13, cleaves the large multimeric adhesive glycoprotein, von Willebrand factor (VWF)
(Sadler, 2008). This proteolytic cleavage appears to be necessary
to eliminate ultralarge (UL)–VWF multimers in the circulation,
thereby preventing the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in
small arterioles and capillaries (Dong et al., 2002). The importance of this mechanism for normal hemostasis is supported by
evidence that patients with deﬁciency of ADAMTS13 function,
diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),
have circulating UL–VWF in the blood and a high rate of VWFdependent microvascular thrombosis (Sadler, 2008).
Recently, we demonstrated that ADAMTS13 deﬁciency
causes a progressive decrease of postischemic cerebral blood
ﬂow, resulting in larger infarct volume in a mouse model of
middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO) (Fujioka et al., 2010).
Therefore, we suggested that ADAMTS13 plays an important
role in protecting the brain in the event of ischemic stroke.
Furthermore, ADAMTS13 cleaves VWF on the surface of platelet
thrombi in a shear force-dependent manner, which limits
thrombus growth in vitro (Shida et al., 2008). Thus, ADAMTS13
dissolves only pathological thrombi and not VWF-platelet
primary hemostatic thrombi, and may therefore have a low
risk of inducing intracerebral hemorrhage following dissolution
of thrombi in ischemic stroke. In fact, we also demonstrated
that although subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a type of
hemorrhagic stroke, ADAMTS13 treatment neither increased
the amount of subarachnoid blood nor prolonged the bleeding

time in SAH model mice (Muroi et al., 2014). These observations
suggest that ADAMTS13 could be a key molecule for new
thrombolytic therapy without increasing the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage in ischemic stroke.
The present study was performed to investigate whether
treatment with ADAMTS13 protects against ischemic brain
injury through improving cerebral blood ﬂow with a low risk
of intracerebral hemorrhage compared with tPA. The results
indicated that ADAMTS13 has a wide therapeutic time window and induces little intracerebral hemorrhage compared
with tPA in MCAO model mice.

Results

2.1.
Therapeutic time window of tPA in mice subjected to
MCAO
Treatment with tPA signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volume
and improved neurological score at 24 h after MCAO in 2-h
MCAO mice. However, in 4-h MCAO mice, tPA treatment had
no effect on infarct volume or neurological score at 24 h after
MCAO (Table 1 and Fig. 1).

2.2.
Therapeutic time window of ADAMTS13 in mice
subjected to MCAO
Treatment with ADAMTS13 signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct
volume and improved neurological score at 24 h after MCAO
in 2-h MCAO mice. Moreover, in 4-h MCAO mice, treatment
with ADAMTS13 signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volume and
neurological score (Table 1 and Fig. 2).
In the present study, we examined the ADAMTS13 doseresponse effects on infarct volume at doses 0.01, 0.1 and
1.0 mg/kg in 4-h MCAO mice. ADAMTS13 at doses 0.1 and
1.0 mg/kg (but not at 0.01 mg/kg) had comparable effect on
infarct volume in 4-h MCAO mice (data not shown). We have
therefore determined that 0.1 mg/kg is the minimal effective
dose for ADAMTS13.

Adverse effect of delayed treatment with ADAMTS13

increased the incidence of hemorrhage at 24 h after MCAO in

ADAMTS13 was not associated with intracerebral hemorrhage at 24 h after MCAO in 4-h MCAO mice (Fig. 3).

Discussion

The present study was performed to evaluate the protective
effect of ADAMTS13 against ischemic brain injury through
improving cerebral blood ﬂow with a low risk of bleeding
compared to tPA. Our results showed that delayed treatment
with ADAMTS13 reduced the infarct volume, neurological score,
and rCBF without intracerebral hemorrhage in 4-h MCAO mice.
However, tPA was not effective and caused massive intracerebral hemorrhage when administered outside the therapeutic

on rCBF in mice subjected to 4-h MCAO. The rCBF was
measured by LDF. The rCBF was recorded over time
(immediately before and after MCAO; 1, 2, 3, and 4 h after
MCAO; immediately after reperfusion; and 1, 2, 3, and 20 h
after reperfusion). The rCBFs during occlusion and
reperfusion were expressed as percentages of the baseline
LDF value. Administration of ADAMTS13 (0.1 mg/kg)
immediately after reperfusion signiﬁcantly improved the
rCBF, while administration of tPA (10 mg/kg) immediately
after reperfusion induced massive intracerebral hemorrhage
in mice subjected to 4-h MCAO at 24 h after MCAO.

time window in 4-h MCAO mice. Thus, ADAMTS13 may have a
wide therapeutic time window in patients with ischemic stroke.
In this study, treatment with tPA reduced the infarct
volume and improved the neurological score without hemorrhagic complications at 24 h after MCAO in 2-h MCAO mice.
However, in 4-h MCAO mice, delayed treatment with tPA was
not effective and induced massive intracerebral hemorrhage.

Therefore, the therapeutic time window of tPA in our MCAO
model mice was less than 4 h after onset of ischemic stroke.
These data are similar to the clinical characteristics of tPA
therapy. In the acute phase of ischemic stroke, tPA was
shown to exert marked effects against infarct formation
and functional deﬁcit (Hacke et al., 1995; Mohr, 2000). However, delayed treatment with tPA was not only poorly effective but also increased the risk of severe bleeding (Mohr, 2000;
Won et al., 2014; Asahi et al., 2003; Al-Khaled et al., 2014). Our
data showed that although delayed treatment with tPA
transiently increased the rCBF after administration, tPA
caused a decrease in rCBF at 24 h after MCAO in 4-h MCAO
mice. This result suggested that delayed treatment with tPA
may lead to hemorrhagic infarction. Thus, these models of 2h and 4-h MCAO in mice reﬂect tPA treatment inside and
outside of the therapeutic time window, respectively.
Delayed treatment with ADAMTS13 reduced the infarct
volume and improved the neurological score at 24 h after MCAO
in 4-h MCAO mice. We considered that ADAMTS13 could
ameliorate cerebral ischemic injury because it improved the
rCBF without hemorrhagic complications despite delayed treatment. These observations raise questions regarding why delayed
treatment with ADAMTS13 did not induce intracerebral hemorrhage despite being a form of thrombolytic therapy similar to tPA
treatment. Although the mechanism underlying the induction of
intracerebral hemorrhage after delayed treatment with tPA
remains unclear, we postulated two mechanisms for this complication. First, tPA is known to aggravate cerebral endothelial
injury and blood–brain barrier (BBB) destruction by excessive
thrombolysis under long-term ischemic conditions (Dijkhuizen
et al., 2002; Ding et al., 2014), and excessive thrombolysis by tPA
may result in loss of the functions necessary to sustain hemostasis. Second, delayed treatment with tPA alters vascular immunoreactivity of inﬂammation in the ischemic brain, and delayed
treatment with tPA increases vascular immunoreactivity to Pselectin, E-selectin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) (Zhang et al., 1999). Moreover, the newly discovered plasminogen receptor, Plg-RKT, transmits proinﬂammatory signals (Miles
et al., 2014). Weakening of the cerebral endothelium by inﬂammation increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (Uekawa
et al., 2014). We propose that reducing the risk of intracerebral
hemorrhage may require thrombolytic therapy independent of
plasminogen and the antiinﬂammatory reaction. ADAMTS13
may have a relatively low risk of intracerebral hemorrhage
because the only known substrate for ADAMTS13 is VWF
(Wang et al., 2013). Moreover, ADAMTS13 dissolves only pathological thrombi and not VWF-platelet primary hemostatic
thrombi as cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 requires high shear
stress caused by thrombus formation within vessels (Shida et al.,
2008). However, this does not occur under conditions of low
shear stress due to small thrombus formation. By its characteristic function of cleaving VWF, ADAMTS13 may be able to
maintain a physiological balance between hemostasis and
thrombolysis. In fact, in this study, intracerebral hemorrhage
was not induced by treatment with ADAMTS13, in contrast to
treatment with tPA in 4-h MCAO mice. In addition, Zhao et al.
(2009) reported that ADAMTS13 preparations did not produce
cerebral hemorrhage in any of the treated brains. Therefore,
ADAMTS13 may be less likely to induce intracerebral hemorrhage in cases of ischemic stroke. In addition, we recently

334

brain research 1624 (2015) 330–335

demonstrated that ADAMTS13 deﬁciency exacerbates insults
after cerebral ischemia by up-regulating (UL)–VWF-mediated
inﬂammation, which can enhance HMGB1 neurotoxicity in the
systemic and local environments (Fujioka et al., 2012). HMGB1, a
non-histone DNA-binding protein, was reported to be massively
released into the extracellular space immediately after an
ischemic insult, and to induce neuroinﬂammation in the postischemic brain (Kim et al., 2006). HMGB1 is also actively secreted
by monocytes and macrophages or released by necrotic cells into
the extracellular milieu and acts as a mediator of severe vascular
inﬂammatory conditions (Hirata et al., 2013; Wang et al., 1999;
Abraham et al., 2000). Moreover, Qiu et al. (2010) demonstrated
HMGB1 triggers matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) upregulation in neurons and astrocytes after cerebral ischemia.
Up-regulation of MMP-9 causes BBB destruction, vasogenic
cerebral edema, and hemorrhage (Leonardo and Pennypacker,
2009). Thus, increasing HMGB1 levels after ischemic stroke may
have the potential to induce intracerebral hemorrhage. In this
study, we demonstrated that treatment with ADAMTS13 signiﬁcantly reduced plasma HMGB1 levels at 24 h after MCAO in 4h MCAO mice. Thus, ADAMTS13 may reduce the risk of
intracerebral hemorrhage by preventing HMGB1-induced cerebral endothelial injury.
ADAMTS13 could ameliorate cerebral ischemic injury and
thus improve cerebral blood ﬂow with a low risk of hemorrhagic complication and prevent inﬂammation-induced cerebral endothelial damage. These results indicated that
ADAMTS13 has a longer therapeutic time window in ischemic
stroke than tPA, and may become a new antithrombotic and
antiinﬂammatory agent against ischemic disease.

Focal cerebral ischemia

drugs after reperfusion in 4-h MCAO mice was deﬁned as
delayed treatment.

4.3.
Cerebral infarct volume and hemorrhagic volume 24 h
after MCAO
The animals were sacriﬁced by decapitation 24 h after MCAO.
The brains were removed and cut into sectioned coronally
into four slices 2 mm thick using a mouse brain matrix. The
hemorrhagic area was measured in each slice using an image
analysis system (NIH Image, version 1.63; National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD), and the hemorrhagic volume was
calculated. Cerebral infarct volume was also measured by
image analysis in slices stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO).

4.4.

Neurological score

Neurological deﬁcit was assessed just before administration
of drugs and 24 h after induction of MCAO using a neurological score as described previously (Hayakawa et al., 2008).
Brieﬂy, scores were divided into 5 groups: 0, normal motor
function; 1, ﬂexion of the torso and the contralateral forelimb
on lifting of the animal by the tail; 2, circling to the ipsilateral
side but normal posture at rest; 3, circling to the ipsilateral
side; 4, rolling to the ipsilateral side; 5, leaning to the
ipsilateral side at rest (no spontaneous motor activity).

4.5.

Regional cerebral blood ﬂow

The regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) was measured by
Laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry using the probe (diameter 0.5 mm)
of a laser-Doppler ﬂowmeter (ALF2100; Advance Co., Tokyo,
Japan) inserted into the left cortex (  0.22 mm anterior and
2.5 mm lateral to bregma; depth 2 mm from the skull surface)
through a guide cannula. The rCBF was measured during
MCAO and 20 h after reperfusion in mice subjected to 4h MCAO.

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male ddY mice (6–8
weeks, 25–35 g, Kiwa Experimental Animal Laboratory,
Wakayama, Japan) as described previously (Hayakawa et al.,
2008). The mice were re-anesthetized with isoﬂurane (Escain;
Pﬁzer, Osaka, Japan) 2 or 4 h after occlusion, and reperfusion
was established by withdrawal of the ﬁlament. Occlusion of the
middle cerebral arterial (MCA) was conﬁrmed by examining
forelimb ﬂexion after awakening from anesthesia. All procedures regarding animal care and use were performed in
compliance with the regulations established by the Experimental Animal Care and Use Committee of Fukuoka University.

Blood samples were collected at 24 h after MCAO in 4-h
MCAO mice. Plasma was obtained after centrifugation
(1200 rpm for 10 min at 4 1C). Plasma HMGB1 levels were
measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA;
Shino-Test Corporation, Kanagawa, Japan).

4.7.

Drug administration

Recombinant human ADAMTS13 was from R&D Systems
(Minneapolis, MN) and tPA (GRTPA) was from Mitsubishi
Tanabe Pharma Corporation (Osaka, Japan).
ADAMTS13 and tPA were dissolved in saline and immediately injected intravenously at doses of 0.1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg
after reperfusion. Saline (vehicle) was used as a control. We
used two different cerebral ischemic models, i.e., 2-h and 4-h
MCAO mice, to demonstrate the therapeutic time windows of
ADAMTS13 and tPA. These drugs were injected intravenously
immediately after reperfusion of MCAO, and administration of

Statistical analysis

Data are presented as means7standard error of the mean

hemorrhagic volume, neurological score, and rCBF between
groups. In all analyses, Po0.05 was taken to indicate statistical signiﬁcance.
