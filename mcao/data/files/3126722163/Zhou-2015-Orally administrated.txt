Pterostilbene (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystilbene) is a component of blueberry. It has been reported that longterm treatment with blueberry has a neuroprotective effect. However, it has not been reported whether
pterostilbene is effective in attenuating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In the present study, focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 min followed by reperfusion. To observe
the dose-dependent effect, pterostilbene (2.5–80 mg/kg, ig) was administered for 3 days before ischemia. To determine the time-dependent effect, pterostilbene (10 mg/kg, ig) was administered as a single dose at 0, 1, or 3 h
after reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after I/R, pterostilbene dose-dependently improved neurological function,
reduced brain infarct volume, and alleviated brain edema. The most effective dose was 10 mg/kg; the therapeutic
time window was within 1 h after I/R and treatment immediately after reperfusion showed the best protective
effect. The protective effect is further conﬁrmed by the results that post-ischemic treatment with pterostilbene
(10 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly improved motor function, alleviated blood brain barrier disruption, increased neurons
survival and reduced cell apoptosis in cortical penumbra after cerebral I/R. We also found that pterostilbene
(10 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly reversed the increased content of malondialdehyde and the decreased activity of superoxide dismutase in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Furthermore, pterostilbene decreased the oxidative stress markers
4-hydroxynonenal and 8-hydroxyguanosine positive cells in the cortical penumbra. All these ﬁndings indicate
that pterostilbene dose- and time-dependently exerts a neuroprotective effect against acute cerebral I/R injury.
This neuroprotective effect of pterostilbene may be associated with its inhibition of oxidative stress and subsequent neuronal apoptosis in the cortical penumbra.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in many countries
(Donnan et al., 2008). Acute ischemic stroke occurs due to the obstruction of blood ﬂow to brain tissue by a thrombus or an embolus, and is
characterized by brain infarct and neurological deﬁcits, especially
motor dysfunction. Restoration of blood ﬂow to ischemic tissue is the
most effective treatment for ischemic stroke. However, the over generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during reperfusion attacks protein, lipid and DNA, and then induces apoptosis and necrosis in brain
tissue especially in the penumbra area, which plays an important role
in determining the ﬁnal size of the brain infarct (Cherubini et al.,
2005). Oxidative stress also leads to blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption after ischemic stroke. The BBB disruption allows normally excluded
intravascular proteins and ﬂuid to penetrate into the cerebral parenchymal extracellular space and leads to vasogenic cerebral edema that exacerbates behavioral disability (del Zoppo, 2006; Sandoval and Witt,

2008). Considering the important role of ROS in the pathology of stroke,
antioxidant therapy for ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced damage attracts intense interest. Previous research indicates that consumption of
antioxidant-rich diets have been associated with a decreased risk of
stroke in humans (Joshipura et al., 1999). Many animal studies also
show that antioxidants protect the brain against cerebral I/R injury
(Gao et al., 2006; Karalis et al., 2011; Rodrigo et al., 2013).
Pterostilbene (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystilbene) is a natural stilbene initially isolated from sandalwood and also a component of blueberry (Adrian et al., 2000; Rimando et al., 2004). Many studies have
shown that pterostilbene exhibits a variety of biological and pharmacological activities, including anti-inﬂammatory, anticancer and analgesic
activities (Remsberg et al., 2008; McCormack and McFadden, 2013). As
a structural analogue of resveratrol, pterostilbene also possesses significant antioxidant activity. It has been reported that pterostilbene exhibited strong anti-oxidant activity against various free radicals such as
DPPH, hydroxyl, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide in a concentration
dependent manner in vitro (Acharya and Ghaskadbi, 2013; Saw et al.,
2014). Previous studies indicated that chronic treatment with blueberry
enriched diets protects hippocampal neurons against ischemic injury in

200

rats (Sweeney et al., 2002), reduced infarct volume in the cerebral cortex and increased post-stroke locomotor activity (Wang et al., 2005).
Recent studies showed that pterostilbene has neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing properties, and in fact improved cognitive performance in a dose-dependent manner in aged rats (Joseph et al., 2008).
Dietary supplementation of pterostilbene for 8 weeks signiﬁcantly improved radial arm water maze function and up-regulated the expression of antioxidative enzymes in aged mice (Chang et al., 2011).
However, it still remains unclear whether pterostilbene has a neuroprotective effect on cerebral I/R injury. If it does, the optimal dose and
timing of pterostilbene treatment need to be elucidated. Moreover,
whether or not its antioxidative effect is involved in this process remains to be clariﬁed.
Therefore, in the present study, we ﬁrst observe the preventive effect
of pterostilbene and get a reference dose to further observe its therapeutic effect on acute focal cerebral I/R injury in a mouse model; then
we fully evaluate the therapeutic effect of pterostilbene on cerebral I/R
injury, focusing on recovery of neurological function, histological
outcome, and BBB disruption. Furthermore, we studied the effect of
pterostilbene on oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis in brain tissue
after cerebral I/R.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
Pterostilbene was purchased from Great Forest Biomedical LTD.
(Hangzhou, China) and its purity was 99.2%; 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC), Evans blue (EB), toluidine blue, Tween-80 and trichloroacetic acid were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO,
USA).
2.2. Experimental animals
Experiments were performed in a total of 255 male Kunming mice
weighing 25–30 g (Certiﬁcate No. SYXK 2008-0003, Experimental Animal Center, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China). Mice were housed
under a controlled temperature (22 ± 1 °C) with a 12-h light/dark
cycle, and allowed free access to food and water. Experimental protocols
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Xiamen University in compliance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Publication No. 85-23, revised 1985).

group, vehicle-treated I/R group, and pterostilbene-treated I/R groups
(2.5, 10, 40, or 80 mg/kg). Vehicle or pterostilbene was orally administered once a day in a volume of 10 ml/kg for 3 consecutive days before
ischemia. Twenty- four hours after I/R, the mice were assessed for neurological function and then sacriﬁced to collect brain sections for TTC
staining (n = 6 mice in sham group and n = 10 mice in the remaining
groups).
To determine the time-dependent effect of pterostilbene, mice were
randomly assigned to ﬁve groups: sham group, vehicle-treated I/R
group, pterostilbene-treated I/R groups at different time points (0 h,
1 h, or 3 h after reperfusion). Vehicle or 10 mg/kg of pterostilbene
(the most effective dose of pterostilbene as pre-ischemia treatment
against cerebral I/R injury) was orally administered as a single dose at
different time points after reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after I/R,
the mice were assessed for neurological function and then sacriﬁced
to collect brain sections for TTC staining (n = 6 mice in sham group
and n = 10 mice in the remaining groups).
To determine the effect of post-ischemic treatment with pterostilbene
on acute cerebral I/R injury, mice were randomly assigned to ﬁve groups:
sham group treated with vehicle, sham group treated with 10 mg/kg
pterostilbene, vehicle-treated I/R group, pterostilbene-treated I/R groups
(2.5, 10 mg/kg). For sham group, vehicle or pterostilbene was orally administered at 0 and 2 h after operation; for I/R group, vehicle or
pterostilbene was orally administered at 0 and 2 h after reperfusion.
In one series, mice were assessed for neurological function and then
sacriﬁced to collect brain tissue for malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity assays (n = 6 mice in sham group and
n = 10 mice in the remaining groups) 24 h after I/R; in the second series, mice were sacriﬁced to collect brain sections for TTC staining
(n = 6 mice in sham group and n = 10 mice in the remaining groups)
24 h after I/R; in the third series, mice were sacriﬁced for BBB observation 6 h after I/R (n = 6 mice in sham group and n = 10 mice in the remaining groups).
To evaluate the effect of post-ischemic treatment with pterostilbene
on histological changes, mice were randomly assigned to three groups:
sham group, vehicle-treated I/R group, pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)treated I/R group. Vehicle or pterostilbene (10 mg/kg) was orally administered at 0 and 2 h after reperfusion (n = 3 mice in sham group
and n = 6 mice in the remaining groups). Twenty-four hours after I/R,
mice were sacriﬁced to collect brain sections for toluidine blue staining,
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP end-labeling
(TUNEL) assay, and immunohistochemical analysis.
2.5. Behavior tests

2.3. Induction of focal cerebral I/R injury
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as we previously reported (Zhou et al., 2012). Mice were
anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, ip.). Brieﬂy, a 6-0 nylon
monoﬁlament suture, blunted at the tip and coated with 1% poly-L-lysine, was inserted through the right common carotid artery (CCA) into
the internal carotid artery (ICA) and advanced approximately 10 mm
distal to the carotid bifurcation to occlude the origin of the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) at the junction of the Circle of Willis. Ninety minutes after occlusion, the suture was withdrawn to allow reperfusion.
Sham-operated mice underwent identical surgery, except that the
intraluminal ﬁlament was not inserted. After surgery, mice were kept
in a warm box heated by lamps until they woke up and then returned
to their home cages.
2.4. Animal experimental protocols and drug application
Pterostilbene was dissolved in Tween-80, and then diluted to 10%
solution with normal saline. 10% Tween-80 saline solution was used
as a vehicle control. To observe the dose-dependent effect of
pterostilbene, mice were randomly divided into six groups: sham

The experiment was performed between 9 A.M. and 4 P.M. at standard laboratory conditions (at temperature 25 ± 2 °C and relative humidity 45–50%). To observe the dose- and time-dependent effects of
pterostilbene, only the Bederson score was assayed at 24 h after reperfusion. To observed the effect of post-ischemic treatment with
pterostilbene, the Bederson score and motor function were assayed at
24 h after cerebral I/R. The order of the assays (Bederson scoring tests,
rotarod test, and balance beam walking test) was always the same to
maintain identical testing conditions for all animals. All tests were carried out and analyzed by the person blind to the experiment.
2.5.1. Bederson scoring test
Bederson scoring test is well established to evaluate the basic neurological dysfunction after ischemic stroke (Bederson et al., 1986). In our
experiment, the Bederson behavioral assessments were performed according to our previous report (Zhou et al., 2012). On the test day, the
Bederson score of each mouse was given manually by the person
blind to the experiment based on a scale from 0 to 3: 0, no deﬁcit; 1,
ﬂexion of contralateral forelimb upon lifting of the whole animal by
the tail; 2, decrease of thrust toward the contralateral plane; 3, circling
to the contra lateral side.

2.5.2. Accelerated rotarod test
Accelerated rotarod test was used to assess motor coordination and
balance alterations of mice (Ferrara et al., 2009). The apparatus (YLS-4C,
Yiyan Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd. Jinan, Shangdong,
China) consisted of a black striated rod (diameter: 3 cm) separated into
5 compartments (width: 6 cm). Before surgery all animals were pretrained for 3 consecutive days (3 trails a day). Firstly, mice were placed
on the rod without rotation for 30 s and thereafter, for 120 s, with a low
speed rotation from 5 to 40 rpm. Each mouse which fell before 60 s was
returned on the rod until mouse was able to stay on it for at least 60 s.
After training for 3 days, all animals were able to stay on the accelerated
rotarod for at least 1 min. There were no signiﬁcant differences in the
fall latency among all groups before surgery. On the test day, each
mouse was placed on the rod rotating from 5 to 40 rpm over 2 min. At
each trial, the latency to fall was recorded with a maximum time of
120 s. Passive rotation, accompanying the rod without walking, was
considered as a fall. Each mouse was tested 3 times a day with a
10 min inter-trial interval (ITI). The mean of three trials was calculated
for each mouse.
2.5.3. Balance beam walking test
Balance beam walking test was used to assess motor function in
mice, especially hind limb dysfunction (Southwell et al., 2009). The
wooden beam was 1 m in length and either 2.8 cm (wide beam) or
1.2 cm (narrow beam) wide. The beam was 50 cm above a padded surface. Before surgery mice were pre-trained on all beams for 3 consecutive days (3 trails a day) until they could walk through the beams
stably. In each trial, mouse was placed at the start of the beam and
trained to traverse the beam to an enclosed box at the opposite end.
On the test day, the performance of each mouse to traverse the beam
was scored as follows: 0, if mouse traverses the beam without any
slips of the hind limb; 1, if mouse traverses the beam with more than
one foot-slip, but less than 50% foot-slips of the affected hind limb; 2,
if mouse traverses the beam with more than 50% foot-slips of the affected hind limb; 3, if mouse traverses the beam reluctantly, but the affected
hind limb cannot help to move; 4, if mouse is unable to move, but able to
stay on the beam; 5, if mouse is unable to stay on the beam. Three trials
were performed per mouse for each beam with a 10 min ITI between
beams. The mean score of three trials was calculated for each mouse.
2.6. Assessments of infarct volume and ipsilateral edema
After evaluation of motor function, these mice were sacriﬁced by decapitation after anesthesia; the brains were rapidly removed and cut into
5 coronal sections (2 mm thick). Then, these sections were immersed in
2% TTC in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 20 min in the dark,
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) overnight. The infarct
area of each TTC-stained section was measured by ImageTool 2.0 software (University of Texas Health Science Center, Texas, TX, USA), and infarct volume was calculated as infarct area × thickness (2 mm). The
added infarct volumes from all brain sections gave the total infarct volume. To determine the extent of ipsilateral edema, the percentage increase in ischemic hemisphere volume was calculated as (ipsilateral
volume − contralateral volume) / contralateral volume × 100%.
2.7. Evaluation of BBB disruption
To evaluate the extent of BBB disruption after cerebral I/R, EB leakage
in brain tissue was determined 6 h after reperfusion according to our
previous report (Zhou et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, 5% EB in 0.9% saline was intravenously administered (4 ml/kg) 1 h before reperfusion. After
transcardial perfusion with 0.9% saline, the brain was removed, cut
into ﬁve 2-mm-thick coronal sections and photographed. The areas of
EB leakage on each brain section were measured using an image analysis system and calculated as EB leakage area × thickness (2 mm). The
cumulative EB leakage volume from all brain slices was calculated as

201

the total EB leakage volume. In addition, brain tissue in the ischemic
hemispheres was collected, weighed and homogenized in 50% trichloroacetic acid solution using a homogenizer (IKA, Staufen, Germany).
After centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was spectrophotometrically measured at 620 nm. EB leakage content in brain tissue was calculated as μg/g tissue.
2.8. Histological studies
2.8.1. Brain section preparation
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, mice were transcardially perfused with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and ﬁxed in the same ﬁxative overnight at 4 °C. Before
cryosectioning, tissues were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PB for
48 h. Serial 10-μm coronal sections (Bregma 0.5 mm–0.14 mm) were
cut and used for toluidine blue staining, TUNEL assay, and immunohistochemical analysis.
2.8.2. Toluidine blue staining
The 10-μm sections were stained with 1% toluidine blue in PBS for
20 min. After rinsing with double distilled water, they were dehydrated
and mounted with Permount (Boshide Biotechnology Company,
Wuhan, China).
2.8.3. TUNEL assay
DNA fragmentation was detected using a TUNEL assay kit (Boshide
Biotechnology Company, Wuhan, China) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, brain sections were pre-treated
with 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS before staining at room temperature
for 10 min to inhibit the endogenous peroxidase activity, and then were
digested by proteinase K (20 μg/ml) at room temperature for another
10 min. After incubation with TUNEL reaction mixture containing DIGdUTP and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase at 37 °C for 2 h, the sections were washed and incubated with anti-DIG-Biotin IgG (1:200,
Boshide Biotechnology Company, Wuhan, China) for 2 h and then
streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (HRP) solution (1:200, Boshide
Biotechnology Company, Wuhan, China) for 2 h at room temperature
followed by diaminobenzidine (DAB) as colorimetric substrate. Deionized water was used as negative controls in parallel reactions instead
of TUNEL reaction mixture. Each procedure was followed by several
rinses in tris buffered saline (TBS).
2.8.4. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG)
immunohistochemistry
After incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min to inhibit the
endogenous peroxidase activity, and 5% normal rabbit serum for 2 h at
room temperature, brain sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C
with a goat polyclonal antibody against 4-HNE (1:50; a marker for
lipid peroxidation, Millipore Corp, Temecula, CA, USA), or a goat polyclonal antibody against 8-OHdG (1:200; a marker for oxidative DNA
damage, Calbiochem, EMD Chemicals Inc, Darmstadt, Germany). Subsequently, brain sections were incubated with biotinylated rabbit antigoat IgG (1:200, Boshide Biotechnology Company, Wuhan, China) for
2 h, and then streptavidin HRP (1:200) for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, the sections were visualized using DAB. Normal goat serum was
used instead of primary antibody in control sections.
2.8.5. Imaging and analysis
In sections stained with toluidine blue, intact neurons were deﬁned
as lightly stained cells with a round nucleus. Intact neurons and DAB
positive cells were counted in three randomly chosen and nooverlapping squares of identical size (area of 0.13 mm2) located in the
cortical penumbra (the region marked by asterisks showed in Fig. 5Aa). The density of intact neurons and DAB positive cells were expressed
as the number of cells per mm2. Samples from sham-operated mice

202

were prepared as controls. To avoid bias, analyzers were unaware of the
experimental design.
2.9. Measurement of MDA content and SOD activity in brain tissue

(one-way ANOVA, F3, 36 = 3.474, P = 0.0037; post-hoc Tukey's test,
q = 3.474, P N 0.05, vs. vehicle treated I/R mice, Fig. 1E). Therefore,
the optimal timing of post-ischemic treatment was within 1 h after
reperfusion.

Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, brain tissue in ipsilateral hemisphere was separated and homogenized in cold saline for MDA content
and SOD activity assays. All procedures were performed according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). In brief, MDA content was measured by determining the absorbance of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances at
532 nm by spectrometry. SOD activity was measured using the xanthine
oxidase method. Absorbance was determined at 550 nm by spectrometry. All protein concentrations of brain tissue homogenates were determined using a BCA kit (Applygen Technologies Inc., Beijing, China).

3.2. The effect of post-ischemic treatment with pterostilbene on neurological
function after acute cerebral I/R

2.10. Statistical analysis

3.2.1. Bederson scoring test
Twenty-four hours after cerebral I/R, vehicle treated cerebral I/R
mice showed circular behavior, spontaneous depression, and loss of
muscle coordination in comparison to sham mice. Scores of the
vehicle-treated I/R mice were signiﬁcantly higher than those of the vehicle-treated sham mice (one-way ANOVA, F4.37 = 26.25, P b 0.01; posthoc Tukey's test, q = 11.06, P b 0.01, Fig. 2A). Pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)
signiﬁcantly decreased the Bederson scores compared to vehicletreated I/R mice (post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 5.16, P b 0.05, Fig. 2A).
There was almost no neurological dysfunction in both vehicle- and
pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)-treated sham mice (Fig. 2A).

Values are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).
Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by post-hoc Tukey's multiple comparison test
using Prism 5 for Windows software 2007 (GraphPad Software Inc.,
San Diego, CA, USA). Values of p b 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. The dose- and time-dependent effects of pterostilbene on acute cerebral
I/R injury
To evaluate the dose-dependent effect of pterostilbene on cerebral I/
R injury, mice were pre-treated with pterostilbene (2.5–80 mg/kg) for
3 days before inducing cerebral I/R. Our results indicated that
pterostilbene 10 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg signiﬁcantly attenuated neurological dysfunction (one-way ANOVA, F4, 45 = 5.414, P = 0.0014;
post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 5.394, P b 0.01 and q = 4.495, P b 0.05, vs. vehicle treated I/R mice, for pterostilbene 10 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg respectively, Fig. 1A), reduced infarct volume (one-way ANOVA, F4, 45 = 5.602,
P = 0.0017; post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 5.644, P b 0.01 and q = 4.892,
P b 0.01 vs. vehicle treated I/R mice, for pterostilbene 10 mg/kg and
40 mg/kg respectively, Fig. 1B) and edema degree (one-way ANOVA,
F4, 45 = 5.498, P = 0.0017; post-hoc Turkey's test, q = 5.997, P b 0.01
and q = 5.130, P b 0.01 vs. vehicle treated I/R mice, for pterostilbene
10 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg respectively, Fig. 1C) compared with vehicle
control. In addition, we found that the neuroprotective effect of
pterostilbene at 10 mg/kg was superior to that at 40 mg/kg in most indicators especially the infarct volume which is the most important indicator for ischemic stroke treatment. Pre-treatment with pterostilbene at
10 and 40 mg/kg reduced the infarct volume by 71.4% and 61.9% respectively compared with vehicle control (Fig. 1B); and both smaller dose
(2.5 mg/kg) and larger dose (80 mg/kg) of pterostilbene had no neuroprotection effects (Tukey's test, q = 1.655, P N 0.05 and q = 2.883,
P N 0.05 vs. vehicle treated I/R mice, for pterostilbene 10 mg/kg and
40 mg/kg respectively, Fig. 1B). Therefore, we chose 10 mg/kg of
pterostilbene for the further post-ischemic treatment research.
To determine the time-dependent effect of pterostilbene on cerebral
I/R injury, a single dose of pterostilbene (10 mg/kg, ig) was administered at 0, 1, or 3 h after reperfusion. Pterostilbene (10 mg/kg, ig) administered immediately after reperfusion (0 h) elicited the best
protective effect. However, the protective effect of pterostilbene treatment at 1 h after reperfusion is not complete, i.e. pterostilbene only improved neurological score (one-way ANOVA, F3, 36 = 9.611, P = 0.0003;
post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 5.002, P b 0.01, vs. vehicle treated I/R mice,
Fig. 1D) and alleviated the brain edema degree (one-way ANOVA, F3,
36 = 11.28, P b 0.0001; post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 5.134, P b 0.01, vs. vehicle treated I/R mice, Fig. 1F), but did not reduce the infarct volume

As we know that the early reperfusion is very important for ischemia
treatment, and pharmacokinetic studies have shown the half life of oral
administrated pterostilbene is about 2 h (Kapetanovic et al., 2011;
Azzolini et al., 2014), so to further evaluate the effect of post-ischemic
treatment with pterostilbene, mice were treated with pterostilbene
(2.5, 10 mg/kg) at 0 and 2 h after reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after
reperfusion, the neurological function was evaluated.

3.3. Accelerated rotarod test
Twenty-four hours after cerebral I/R, vehicle-treated I/R mice
showed poor performances in this motor coordination test. Their fall latency decreased by 87% compared to the sham-operated mice (Fig. 2B).
Pterostilbene (2.5 and 10 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly improved the rotarod
performance of I/R mice (one-way ANOVA, F4, 37 = 10.68, P = 0.0001;
post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 4.721, P b 0.05 and q = 7.863, P b 0.01 vs. vehicle treated I/R mice, at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg respectively,
Fig. 2B). The fall latency of pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)-treated I/R mice
was similar to that of the vehicle-treated sham mice (103.6 ± 5.67 s
vs. 101.6 ± 12.57 s, Tukey's test, q = 0.1450, P N 0.05, Fig. 2B). There
was no difference in fall latency between vehicle-treated and
pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)-treated sham mice (Tukey's test, q = 0.076,
P N 0.05, Fig. 2B).
3.4. Balance beam walking test
Twenty-four hours after cerebral I/R, when vehicle-treated I/R mice
passed across the beam, their paralyzed side of the hind limbs could not
help their movement forward, and some vehicle-treated I/R mice even
could not traverse the beam. Scores of the vehicle-treated I/R mice
were signiﬁcantly higher than those of the sham-operated mice (oneway ANOVA, F4.37 = 6.49, P = 0.0018, post-hoc Tukey's test, q =
5.083, P b 0.05, Fig. 2C). Scores of the pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)treated mice were much lower than those of the vehicle-treated mice
(0.67 ± 0.2 vs. 3.5 ± 0.72 points, Tukey's test, q = 5.57, P b 0.01,
Fig. 2C). As a control, all sham-operated mice exhibited a successful performance in this test; and there was no difference between vehicletreated and pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)-treated sham mice (Tukey's test,
q = 0.463, P N 0.05, Fig. 2C). The same result was attained in the narrow
balance beam walking test (Fig. 2D).

Fig. 1. The dose- and time-dependent effects of pterostilbene on acute cerebral I/R injury in mice. The neurological deﬁcit score (A, D), infarct volume (B, E) and edema degree (C, F) were
determined 24 h after cerebral I/R in mice. To evaluate the dose-dependent effect of pre-ischemic treatment, pterostilbene (2.5–80 mg/kg, ig) was administered for 3 days before inducing
cerebral I/R (A–C). To determine the time-dependent effect of post-ischemic treatment, pterostilbene (10 mg/kg, ig) was administrated at the indicated time points (D–F). Data are
expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 10 mice in each I/R group). *P b 0.05 and **P b 0.01 vs. vehicle-treated I/R group (one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test).

(Fig. 3A). Pterostilbene (10 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volume by 79% compared to vehicle control (one-way ANOVA, F2, 27 =
11.13, P = 0.0005, post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 6.281, P b 0.01 Fig. 3C). Especially pterostilbene markedly decreased infarct area of brain sections
which include sensorimotor cortex (Fig. 3A, B). The volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere increased by 18.96% compared with that of the contralateral hemisphere, indicating brain edema. Pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)
reduced the degree of ipsilateral edema by 79.2% compared to vehicle
control (one-way ANOVA, F2, 27 = 8.29, P = 0.0021, post-hoc Tukey's

in sham operated mice (Fig. 4A).
3.7. The effect of post-ischemic treatment with pterostilbene on neuronal
injury in the cortical penumbra after acute cerebral I/R
Using toluidine blue staining, we found that intact neuron which
was lightly stained and had a round nucleus was almost absent in the
cortical penumbra after cerebral I/R. Instead, there were many darkly
stained cells with oval or fusiform nuclei in this region (Fig. 5A-b e, B).
Compared to vehicle control, pterostilbene increased the number of intact neurons in the corresponding area (Fig. 5A-c f, B). Intact neuron
density of the pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)-treated mice was much larger
than those of the vehicle-treated I/R mice (548 ± 34.10 cells/mm2 vs.
16.17 ± 6.40 cells/mm2, one-way ANOVA, F2, 12 = 117.2, P b 0.0001;
post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 8.817, p b 0.01, vs. vehicle-treated I/R mice,
Fig. 5B). As a control, the tissue structure in sham mice was compact,
cell outlines were clear and nucleoli were clearly visible. The density
of intact neuron in sham group mouse was 1325 ± 99.72 cells/mm2
(Fig. 5A-d, B).
For detecting apoptotic cell death, TUNEL staining was performed
using an in situ cell death detection kit. Twenty-four hours after cerebral
I/R, there were many TUNEL positive cells in the cortical penumbra
(Fig. 5A-h). Pterostilbene signiﬁcantly reduced the number of TUNEL
positive cells in the corresponding area (one-way ANOVA, F2, 12 =
30.22, p = 0.0007, post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 6.028, P b 0.05, vs.
vehicle-treated I/R mice, Fig. 5A-i, C). Almost no TUNEL positive cells
were detected in brain sections of sham mice (Fig. 5A-g).
3.8. The effect of post-ischemic treatment with pterostilbene on oxidative
stress in brain tissue after acute cerebral I/R
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, MDA content in ipsilateral
hemisphere increased remarkably which indicates lipid peroxidation
of brain tissue. Pterostilbene (10 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly reversed the increased content of MDA (one-way ANOVA, F4, 37 = 16.19, P b 0.0001;
post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 4.337, P b 0.05, vs. vehicle-treated I/R mice,
Fig. 6A) and the decreased activity of SOD in brain tissue (one-way
ANOVA, F4, 37 = 6.287, P = 0.0013, post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 4.26,
p b 0.05, vs. vehicle-treated I/R mice, Fig. 6B). There was no difference

between vehicle-treated and pterostilbene (10 mg/kg) -treated sham
mice in MDA content (Tukey's test, q = 0.3665, p N 0.05, Fig. 6A) and
SOD activity (Tukey's test, q = 0.7991, P N 0.05, Fig. 6B).
Furthermore, a number of 4-HNE and 8-OHdG positive cells were
found in the cortical penumbra of the vehicle-treated ischemic mice
(Fig. 6C-b, e). Pterostilbene (10 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly decreased the
number of 4-HNE positive cells by 56.5% (one-way ANOVA, F2, 12 =
33.22, P = 0.0006; post-hoc Tukey's test, q = 4.337, p b 0.01, vs.
vehicle-treated I/R mice, Fig. 6C-c, D) and the number of 8-OHdG positive cells by 55.7% (one-way ANOVA, F2, 12 = 268.6, P b 0.0001; posthoc Tukey's test, q = 20.89, p b 0.01, vs. vehicle-treated I/R mice,
Fig. 6C-f, E) compared to vehicle-treated I/R mice. There were almost
no 4-HNE or 8-OHdG positive cells in brain sections from sham mice
(Fig. 6C-a, d).
4. Discussion
In the present study, we report for the ﬁrst time that pterostilbene
dose-dependently protects mice against acute cerebral I/R injury. Evidence is that pterostilbene improves neurological deﬁcit, reduces
brain infarct volume, and alleviates brain edema and BBB disruption.
The most effective dose is 10 mg/kg; the therapeutic time window is
within 1 h after I/R and treatment immediately after reperfusion
showed the best protective effect. This protective effect may be mediated by the reduction of oxidative stress and subsequent decrease of neuronal apoptosis in the cortical penumbra.
The most important ﬁnding is that pterostilbene dose-dependently
reduces brain injury after I/R. This result is consistent with previous reports that dietary supplementation with blueberries for 4–6 weeks reduces brain injury after ischemic stroke (Sweeney et al., 2002; Wang
et al., 2005). Our results further conﬁrm that pterostilbene is one of
the activate ingredients of blueberry to exert its neuroprotective effect.
We also found that the neuroprotective effect of pterostilbene is dosedependent. The effective doses are ranged at 10 and 40 mg/kg. It has
been reported that pretreatment with pterostilbene (10–40 mg/kg) exerts neuroprotective effect against lipopolysaccharides (LPS) induced
brain injury (Hou et al., 2014). In addition, we found that the neuroprotective effect of pterostilbene at 10 mg/kg was superior to that at
40 mg/kg in most indicators, especially the infarct volume which is
the most important indicator for ischemic stroke treatment; and both

were lightly stained and had a round nucleus were almost absent in the cortical penumbra. Instead, there were many darkly stained cells with oval or fusiform nuclei (A-b e). Compared to
vehicle-treated mice, there were more intact neurons in the brain sections from pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)-treated mice (A-c f). Bar = 100 μm in A-b c; Bar = 25 μm in A-d-i. The density of
intact neurons is shown in (B) and the density of TUNEL positive cells is shown in (C). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n = 3 mice in sham group and n = 6 mice in the remaining
groups). ##P b 0.01 vs. sham; *P b 0.05, **P b 0.01 vs. vehicle-treated I/R mice (one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test).

smaller dose (2.5 mg/kg) and larger dose (80 mg/kg) had no neuroprotective effects. Therefore, with respect to its neuroprotective effect,
pterostilbene displayed a bell-shaped dose–response curve with an optimal dose of 10 mg/kg. This atypical dose response curve could also be
found in other neuroprotective antioxidants of diverse structures and
activities (Beni et al., 2004; Ye et al., 2007). The lack of effect at the larger
dose cannot be explained by the neurotoxicity of pterostilbene, because
pterostilbene is known as a very safe agent. It has been reported that

oral intake of a high dose of pterostilbene (3000 mg/kg/day) for about
1 month was not associated with signiﬁcant local or systemic toxicity
in animals (Ruiz et al., 2009). Many studies show that antioxidants at
high doses may turn into pro-oxidants via interaction with other oxidants or antioxidants (Beni et al., 2004; Bjelakovic et al., 2012). This
may partly explain why pterostilbene at larger dose lose its neuroprotective effect. Actually the pro-oxidant properties of pterostilbene may
be an element of cancer chemoprevention due to induction of apoptosis

in cancer cells (Schneider et al., 2010; Moon et al., 2013). This result suggests that the neuroprotective effect of pterostilbene against cerebral I/R
injury is dose-limited, namely it is effective at an appropriate dose
range.

Otherwise, our results indicate that the therapeutic time window of
pterostilbene is within 1 h after I/R and treatment immediately after reperfusion showed the best protective effect. It was reported that longterm pretreatment with pterostilbene had a neuroprotective effect

208

against brain injury (Joseph et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2012; Hou et al.,
2014). In the present study, short-term treatment with pterostilbene
can also exert the neuroprotective effect. Pharmacokinetic studies have
shown that a peak concentration of pterostilbene was detected in the
brain tissue at about 2 h after oral administration of a single dose
(20 mg/kg) and was cleared from blood with a half life of about 2 h in
rats (Kapetanovic et al., 2011; Azzolini et al., 2014). In our study,
pterostilbene treatment immediately after reperfusion showed the best
protective effect. This result indicates that pterostilbene mainly exerts
its neuroprotective role in the early stage of reperfusion after brain ischemia. This result is in agreement with the notion that early reperfusion is
critical for reperfusion treatment (Dyker and Lees, 1998; Olmez and
Ozyurt, 2009).
Another interesting ﬁnding of our study is that post-ischemic
pterostilbene dose-dependently decreases the neurological deﬁcit
scores and improves motor performances in accelerated rotarod and
balance beam walking tests. It is also reported that pretreatment with
blueberry diets remarkably improves motor performance in old aged
animals (Joseph et al., 2003, 2008; Shukitt-Hale et al., 2007). This result
has signiﬁcant clinical implications because neurological dysfunction,
especially motor dysfunction, is the most negative effect of ischemic
stroke and the primary cause of adult disability in many countries.
This effect may be attributed to the protection of brain tissue especially
neurons in sesorimotor cortex by pterostilbene. As we know, the sensorimotor cortex is an important component involved in motor function
and the damage to this cortex may lead to behavioral impairments, notably affecting motor function (Mimura et al., 2005; Bu et al., 2007; Sun
et al., 2011). Accordingly, we found that pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)
markedly decreased infarct area of brain sections which include sensorimotor cortex. It is worth mentioning that during the accelerated
rotarod test, which requires better motor coordination and duration,
even 2.5 mg/kg pterostilbene shows obvious neurological functional
improvement. Fall latency in pterostilbene (10 mg/kg)-treated mice is
even similar to that in sham-operated mice. However 2.5 mg/kg
pterostilbene did not reduce infarct volume and brain edema. In addition, although pterostilbene is able to pass through BBB, our results
showed that short-term treatment with pterostilbene did not affect
motor function in sham control mice (Fig. 2). This result is in accordance
with others reports that oral pterostilbene (1–40 mg/kg) 1 h before behavior test did not increase the locomotor activity in normal mice (Al
Rahim et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2014). Thus it seems that pterostilbene
mainly persist motor function after brain injury and the mechanism underlying needs further investigation.
Our study further indicates that pterostilbene can attenuate oxidative
damage and apoptotic cell death in the ischemic penumbra. We found
that pterostilbene decreases both 4-HNE and 8-OHdG positive cells in
the ischemic penumbra. 4-HNE is the major oxidation product of polyunsaturated fatty acid and is regarded as the marker of lipid peroxidation
(Yoshino et al., 1997; Hayashi et al., 2005). 8-OHdG, on the other hand,
is produced when nucleic acid is exposed for oxidative stress, and is
also a DNA oxidative stress marker (Hayashi et al., 1999; Itoh et al.,
2010). Moreover, by TUNEL assay, we observe that pterostilbene reduces
DNA fragmentation, which is a terminal stage of apoptotic DNA degradation in the ischemic penumbra 24 h after I/R. Oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death, especially at the infarct boundary, play important
roles in the development of infarct volume (Briyal et al., 2014). Accordingly, we found that pterostilbene reduced infarct volume. All these results indicate that pterostilbene exerts its neuroprotective effect mainly
by reducing oxidative stress and DNA fragmentation in the ischemic penumbra. In the early phase of cerebral I/R, because of its high lipophilicity,
pterostilbene easily penetrates the cell membranes, nucleus and mitochondria (Chang et al., 2012) and directly scavenge free radicals in the
cell. In addition, the antioxidant effect of pterostilbene may also be attributed to its upregulation of anti-oxidant enzymes such as SOD and CAT. In
the present study, pterostilbene rescues the SOD activity in brain tissue
after cerebral I/R. Pterostilbene could also increase the expression of

SOD and CAT (Bhakkiyalakshmi et al., 2014; Sato et al., 2014). Moreover,
pterostilbene is recently reported to increase the expression of two important nuclear factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α
(PPARα) (Chang et al., 2011) and nuclear factor-E2 related factor 2
(Nrf2) (Saw et al., 2014), which play important roles in the upregulation
of many antioxidant enzymes.
Taken together, our study reveals, for the ﬁrst time, that pre- and
post-ischemic treatment with oral pterostilbene are beneﬁcial in improving motor function, reducing infarct volume and attenuating BBB
disruption after cerebral I/R in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
The most effective dose is 10 mg/kg, and the therapeutic time window
is within 1 h after I/R. The suppression of neuronal oxidation stress
and apoptosis in the cortical penumbra may be, at least partly, associated with this protective effect. These ﬁndings indicate that pterostilbene
may become a natural agent for effectively improving neurological
function and histological abnormality after cerebral I/R.
