TAK-242, an antagonist for Toll-like receptor 4, protects
against acute cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice
Fang Hua1,2,3, Huiling Tang3, Jun Wang3, Megan C Prunty3, Xiaodong Hua4, Iqbal Sayeed3 and Donald G Stein3
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) contributes to cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and is a potential target for the treatment of
ischemic stroke. This experiment is to evaluate the effect of an exogenous TLR4 antagonist, TAK-242, against acute cerebral I/R
injury. A mouse model of cerebral I/R was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. TAK-242 (3 mg/kg body weight)
was injected intraperitoneally 1 hour after ischemia. Our results showed that the concentration of TAK-242 in plasma increased to
52.0 ng/mL 3 hours after injection, was maintained at 54.1 ng/mL 8 hours after injection, and decreased to 22.6 ng/mL 24 hours
after injection. The concentration of TAK-242 in brain tissue increased to 26.1 ng/mL in ischemic hemisphere and 14.2 ng/mL in
nonischemic hemisphere 3 hours after injection, and was maintained at the similar levels 24 hours after injection. We found that
TAK-242 signiﬁcantly reduced cerebral infarction compared with vehicle control, improved neurologic function, inhibited the
phosphorylation of downstream protein kinases in TLR4 signaling pathway, and downregulated the expression of inﬂammatory
cytokines. We conclude that TAK-242 is able to cross blood-brain barrier, blocks TLR4 signaling, mediates the expression of
inﬂammatory cytokines, and protects the brain from acute damage induced by I/R.

INTRODUCTION
Cerebral ischemia is usually the result of the obstruction of brain
arteries and lack of blood supply to the brain. Although therapies
for the restoration of blood ﬂow to brain tissue are effective,
reperfusion in the ischemic brain leads to a cascade of pathophysiologic processes resulting in further damage known as
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. A growing body of evidence
suggests that cerebral I/R induces robust in situ inﬂammatory
responses that contribute to further injury including neuronal
death and white-matter damage.1–3
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a transmembrane pattern-recognition receptor family with important roles in the induction and
regulation of immune/inﬂammatory responses. Toll-like receptor 4
is believed to be involved in several pathologies such as sepsis,
cardiac diseases,4 and I/R injury.5–7 Our studies and others have
revealed that TLR4-mediated signaling is activated after ischemia
and contributes to increased inﬂammatory responses and further
brain injury.7 Resatorvid (TAK-242), an exogenous synthetic antagonist for TLR4, is a small molecule which binds selectively to TLR4
and inhibits TLR4 signal transduction and its downstream signaling events.8–10 However, whether TAK-242 can pass through the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) and inhibit neuroinﬂammation in ischemic brain has not been investigated. The present study evaluated
the ability of TAK-242 to pass through the BBB, its neuroprotective
effect, and its modulation on inﬂammatory cytokines after acute
cerebral I/R in mice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Sixty-two male mice (C57BL/6J; age 12 weeks; body weight 25–
30 g) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME,
USA) and maintained in the Division of Animal Resources at Emory
University. The experiments outlined in this manuscript conform
to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published
by the National Institutes of Health. The animal care and
experimental protocols were approved by the Emory University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
In the experiment to evaluate the protective effect of TAK-242
against ischemia injury, mice were randomly assigned to four
groups: (1) sham surgery treated with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO, vehicle) as sham vehicle control (S, n = 9; four mice were
used for molecular analysis); (2) focal cerebral I/R treated with 1%
DMSO as I/R plus vehicle control (I/R, n = 17; ﬁve mice were used
for molecular analysis); (3) sham surgery treated with TAK-242 (S-T,
n = 9; four mice were used for molecular analysis); and (4) focal
cerebral I/R treated with TAK-242 (I/R-T n = 17; ﬁve mice were used
for molecular analysis).
In another experiment, 10 mice were used to evaluate the
concentration of TAK-242 in plasma and brain tissue. One mouse
(naive, without any treatment) was used as blank control, and 9
mice subjected to cerebral I/R treated with TAK-242 were used to
evaluate the concentration of TAK-242 in plasma and brain tissue
3, 8 and 24 hours after intraperitoneal injection (three mice for

each time point). The plasma, left cerebral hemisphere (ischemia),
and right hemisphere (nonischemia) were harvested for detection
of TAK-242.
Induction of Focal Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion
Focal cerebral I/R was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion
on the left side according to previously published methods.5
Brieﬂy, mice were subjected to anesthesia by 5.0% isoﬂurane
maintained by inhalation of 1.5% to 2% isoﬂurane driven by 100%
oxygen ﬂow. Mice were ventilated (110 breaths per minute with
volume 0.5 mL) and body temperature was regulated at 37°C.
Heart rate and partial pressure of oxygen were monitored during
surgery. After the skin incision, the left common carotid artery, the
external carotid artery, and the internal carotid artery were
carefully exposed. Microvascular aneurysm clips were applied to
the left common carotid artery and the internal carotid artery. A
coated 6-0 ﬁlament (6023PK, Doccol Corp., Redlands, CA, USA) was
introduced into an arteriotomy hole, fed distally into the internal
carotid artery and advanced 11 mm from the carotid bifurcation.
The internal carotid artery clamp was removed and focal cerebral
ischemia started. After ischemia for 60 minutes, the ﬁlament and
the common carotid artery clamp were gently removed (reperfusion starts). The collar suture at the base of the external carotid
artery stump was tightened. The skin was closed, anesthesia was
discontinued, and the animal was allowed to recover in a
prewarmed cage. Sham control mice underwent a neck dissection
and coagulation of the external carotid artery, but without middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Ischemia and reperfusion conditions
were conﬁrmed by the regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF)
detected by a laser Doppler cerebral ﬂow meter (moorVMS-LDF,
Moor Instruments, Delaware, DE, USA) before cerebral ischemia,
during cerebral ischemia, and after reperfusion.
TAK-242 Treatment
TAK-242 was dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in sterile
endotoxin-free water. The ﬁnal concentration of DMSO was 1%.
The dissolved TAK-242 or DMSO (1%) was injected intraperitoneally (3 mg/kg body weight) 1 hour after middle cerebral artery
occlusion or sham surgical operation. This optimal dose was
selected based on previous studies.8–10 The route of administration was modiﬁed to intraperitoneal injection.
Evaluation of Neurologic Score
All the mice were scored by an investigator who was masked
using the method described previously with modiﬁcation.5,11 The
scoring system ranges from 0 to 15, in which 0 is death because of
cerebral I/R injury, and 15 is a perfect score. Brieﬂy, the scoring
system includes ﬁve principal tasks for survival mice: spontaneous
activity over a 3-minute period (0 to 3), symmetry of movement (0
to 3), open-ﬁeld path linearity (0 to 3), beam walking on a
3 cm × 1 cm beam (0 to 3), and response to vibrissae touch (1 to 3).
If the mouse died from cerebral I/R injury, the animal received a
0 point.
Measurement of TAK-242 Concentration in Plasma and Brain
Tissue
Three, 8, or 24 hours after the injection of TAK-242, the mice were
anesthetized with 5.0% isoﬂurane driven by 100% oxygen ﬂow.
Blood (0.95 mL) was drawn from the left ventricle and immediately
mixed with 0.05 mL sodium citrate. The samples were incubated at
room temperature for 30 minutes and centrifuged at 8,000 r.p.m.
The plasma was collected and stored at − 80°C for future use.
Immediately after the blood was drawn, the mice were perfused
with ice-cold normal saline via the ascending aorta until the
perfusion buffer was clear from the right atrium. The brains
were removed and weighed. Brain tissues were homogenized

with buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes.
Supernatants were collected and stored at − 80°C. The concentrations of TAK-242 were detected by Intertek (EI Dorado Hill, CA,
USA) using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection. Brieﬂy, TAK-242 and internal standard (bromfenac) were extracted from 50 μL of mouse plasma or brain
homogenate by liquid-liquid extraction using methyl tertiarybutyl ether. After evaporation to dryness and reconstitution, the
extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography with tandem
mass spectrometry. Run times were ~ 5 minutes. The lower limit of
quantitation for TAK-242 is 0.5 ng/mL for plasma, and 2 ng/g for
brain homogenate. The calibration curve range is 0.5–2,000 ng/mL
for plasma, and 2–4,000 ng/g for brain homogenate. The
concentrations of TAK-242 were calculated based on the
standard curve.
Assessment of Cerebral Infarct Size
The infarct size was determined as described previously.5 Twentyfour hours after I/R, mice were killed and perfused with ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline via the ascending aorta. Brains were
removed and sectioned coronally into 2-mm-thick slices. The slices
were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution
at 37°C for 15 minutes followed by ﬁxation with 10% formalin
neutral buffer solution (pH 7.4). The infarct areas were traced and
quantiﬁed with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Unstained areas (pale color) were deﬁned as ischemic lesions.
The area of infarction and the areas of both hemispheres were
calculated for each brain slice. Edema index was calculated by
dividing the total volume of the left hemisphere by the total
volume of the right hemisphere. The actual infarct volume
adjusted for edema was calculated by dividing the infarct volume
by the edema index. Infarct volumes are expressed as percentage
of the total brain volume ± s.e.m.
Antibody Array
Six hours after cerebral ischemia, mice were killed and perfused
with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline via the ascending aorta.
Ischemic cerebral hemispheres were removed and stored at − 80°C.
Proteins were prepared from ischemic cerebral hemispheres.
Forty inﬂammatory cytokines were analyzed by antibody arrays
(RayBio Cytokine Antibody Arrays—Mouse Inﬂammation Antibody
Array G Series I, RayBiotech, Norcross, GA, USA). Brieﬂy, the glass
chips were air dried for 60 minutes and assembled into an incubation chamber and incubation frame. Blocking buffer (100 μL) was
added into each well and the glass chips were incubated at room
temperature for 30 minutes. After decanting the blocking buffer,
100 μL of each sample was added and incubated at 4°C overnight.
The chips were washed ﬁve times with wash buffer I and then two
times with wash buffer II at room temperature; 70 μL of diluted
biotin-conjugated antibodies was added to each corresponding
well, and the chips were incubated at 4°C overnight. The chips
were washed as previously described and 70 μL of diluted Alexa
Fluor 555–conjugated streptavidin was added to each subarray.
The incubation chamber was covered with an adhesive ﬁlm and
aluminum foil, and incubated at 4°C overnight. The chips were
washed two times with wash buffer I. The incubation frame and
chamber were disassembled. The slides were taken out and
placed in a 50-mL centrifuge tube, washed two times with wash
buffer I at room temperature for 10 minutes each time, washed
once with wash buffer II for 10 minutes, and rinsed with distilled
H2O. The water droplets were removed by centrifuge at 1,000 r.p.
m. for 3 minutes and then dried completely in air for at least
20 minutes while protected from light. The slides were scanned
using a laser scanner (Axon GenePix, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with a Cy3 channel. Signal data were collected and
analyzed by a software from RayBiotech (Norcross, GA, USA).

Western Blots
Western blotting was performed as described previously.12 Brieﬂy,
proteins were extracted from the brain samples harvested 6 hours
after cerebral ischemia, electrophoresed with sodium dodecyl
sulfate polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto Hybond ECL
membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
The ECL membranes were incubated with primary antibody
followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies. Signals were detected with the ECL system (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech) and quantiﬁed by scanning densitometry and
computer-assisted image analysis. The primary antibodies used
were anticyclooxygenase-2 (anti-COX-2), antimatrix metallopeptidase
9 (anti-MMP-9), anti-p-IκB kinase α/β (anti-p-IKKα/β), anti-IKKα, antip-inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B alpha (anti-p-IκBα), anti-IκBα, and
anti-beta actin (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA).
Statistical Analysis
Continuous scale measurements were expressed as mean ± s.e.m.
for each group. Neurologic function (neurologic score) was
analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance on ranks. After
normality testing (Shapiro-Wilk method) and equal variance tests
were passed, all pair-wise multiple comparison procedures
(Dunn’s method) were performed. A value of P o 0.05 was
considered to be signiﬁcant. The concentration of TAK-242 was
analyzed by repeated easures analysis of variance, and the size of
infarction and the levels of inﬂammatory cytokines were analyzed
by one-way analysis of variance. Pair-wise comparisons of group
means (Holm-Sidak method) were used to compare group means
after normality testing (Shapiro-Wilk) and equal variance tests
were passed. A probability level of 0.05 or smaller was used to
indicate statistical signiﬁcance.
RESULTS
Concentration of TAK-242 in Plasma and Brain Tissue
The concentrations of TAK-242 in plasma and brain tissue were
measured at different time points after intraperitoneal injection
using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry.
Our results showed that the concentration of TAK-242 in plasma
increased to 52.0 ng/mL 3 hours after treatment, was maintained
at 54.1 ng/mL 8 hours after treatment, and decreased to 22.6 ng/mL
24 hours after treatment. The concentration of TAK-242 in brain
tissue increased to 26.1 ng/mL (ipsilateral) and 14.2 ng/mL
(contralateral) 3 hours after treatment, was maintained at
26.4 ng/mL (ipsilateral) and 15.1 ng/mL (contralateral) 8 hours
after treatment, and was still maintained at 25.0 ng/mL (ipsilateral)
and 17.5 ng/mL (contralateral) 24 hours after treatment (Figure 1).
Infarct size and Neurologic Score
During ischemia, rCBF decreased to o80% of normal levels
(before ischemia), and after reperfusion, rCBF recovered to 475%
of normal, which conﬁrmed the success of the animal model.
Infarct size and neurologic score were measured 24 hours after
cerebral I/R or sham surgery. Our data showed that sham surgery
treated with vehicle (S) and sham surgery treated with TAK-242
(S-T) did not induce any cerebral infarction. The infarct sizes were
21.3% in the untreated I/R group (I/R) and 12.5% in the TAK-242treated I/R group (I/R-T). TAK-242 treatment signiﬁcantly reduced
brain infarct size by 41% compared with the untreated mice
(P o 0.05; Figure 2).
Our data also showed that sham surgery treated with TAK-242
(S-T) did not induce signiﬁcant neurobehavioral changes compared with sham surgery treated with vehicle (S). Cerebral I/R
signiﬁcantly reduced neurologic score (4.38) compared with sham
surgery treated with vehicle (S) and sham surgery treated with
TAK-242 (S-T, Po0.05; Figure 2). The mice subjected to cerebral I/R

treated with TAK-242 did not show signiﬁcant difference from S
and S-T, which indicated that TAK-242 treatment could improve
neurologic function impaired by cerebral I/R.
Protein Array
Levels of 40 inﬂammatory cytokines were detected 6 hours after
cerebral I/R using an antibody array. Our data showed that the
levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor I, soluble tumor
necrosis factor receptor II, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1
(CXCL1), granulocyte colony–stimulating factor, interleukin-6,
monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inﬂammatory
protein-1γ (MIP-1γ), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1
(TIMP-1) signiﬁcantly increased in ischemic brain compared with
sham controls (P o 0.05; Figures 3 and 4). Treatment with TAK-242
signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor
receptor II, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, MIP-1γ, and TIMP-1
compared with untreated controls (P o 0.05; Figure 4).
Western Blots
Our data showed that the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκBα
signiﬁcantly increased, and that the expression of COX-2 and
MMP-9 were signiﬁcantly upregulated in ischemic brain compared
with sham controls (P o 0.05; Figures 5 and 6). Treatment with
TAK-242 signiﬁcantly inhibited the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and
IκBα, and the expression of COX-2 and MMP-9 compared with
vehicle treated controls (P o 0.05; Figures 5 and 6).
DISCUSSION
Cerebral I/R triggers acute inﬂammation which aggravates
cerebral ischemic injury. One of the important mechanisms of
this process is the activation of the innate immune system. TLRs
play important roles in the induction and regulation of immune/
inﬂammatory responses. To date, 13 TLRs have been identiﬁed in
mammals.13,14 Each TLR can recognize its distinct ligands derived
from various microorganisms or released from damaged tissues.15,16 On activation by exogenous and endogenous ligands,
TLRs recruit their adapter proteins, activate downstream kinases,
and then induce the expression of inﬂammation-associated genes.
Previous studies indicated that TLR4-mediated signaling was
activated in ischemic brain, and that TLR4 deﬁcit attenuated
cerebral ischemic injury in TLR4 knockout mice.17–20 Exogenous
synthetic antagonists for TLR4, such as resatorvid (TAK-242), can

diseases.21,22 However, whether TAK-242 has neuroprotective
effects on ischemic brain remains unknown. To investigate
whether TAK-242 can pass through the BBB and protect the brain
from cerebral I/R, we measured the concentration of TAK-242 in
plasma and brain tissue, and evaluated ischemia-induced
inﬂammation and subsequent brain damage in mice treated with
TAK-242.
We used C57BL/6J mice to establish the model of cerebral I/R.
Body temperature, heart rate, and partial pressure of oxygen were
monitored during surgery, and there was no signiﬁcant difference in
these parameters between the TAK-242-treated and the untreated
groups. Results from rCBF detected by a laser Doppler cerebral ﬂow
meter (moorVMS-LDF) showed that during ischemia, rCBF
decreased to o80% of normal levels (before ischemia), and after
reperfusion, rCBF recovered to 475% of normal, which conﬁrmed
the success of the model of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.
The concentrations of TAK-242 in plasma and brain tissue were
detected by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The results showing that the concentration of TAK-242 in
plasma increased 3 hours after treatment, was maintained 8 hours
after treatment, and decreased at 24 hours after treatment,
indicated that TAK-242 injected intraperitoneally can be absorbed
into blood circulation and is maintained up to 24 hours after
injection (Figure 1). Interestingly, the concentration of TAK-242
in brain tissue also increased after the injection, indicating
that TAK-242 can pass through the BBB in the ischemic and
nonischemic brain, and be maintained in brain tissue for at least
24 hours after injection (Figure 1). Previous studies have indicated
that the pharmacokinetics of TAK-242 depends on the species and
organs—it differs, for example, in dogs and rats, and the
distribution of TAK-242 is different in plasma and kidney.23,24
However, the distribution of TAK-242 in mice plasma and brain
after intraperitoneal injection has not been reported. In addition,
in previous studies, the dosages of TAK-242 ranged from 1 to
10 mg/kg (including 3 mg/kg) in patients, guinea pigs, and mice
via intravenous injection. Base on the previous reports, we
modiﬁed the route of administration from intravenous injection
to intraperitoneal injection. Our results conﬁrmed that TAK-242
injected intraperitoneally could be absorbed into the blood
stream, which was a new ﬁnding in the present study. Importantly,
our data show for the ﬁrst time that TAK-242 can cross the BBB
and enter into ischemic and nonischemic hemispheres in mice
after focal cerebral I/R induced by middle cerebral artery
occlusion. Moreover, the concentration of TAK-242 in the ischemic
hemisphere was signiﬁcantly higher than that in the nonischemic
hemisphere. This may be interpreted to indicate that cerebral I/R
© 2015 ISCBFM

facilitates the capability of TAK-242 to cross the BBB, in the
damaged brain.
To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of TAK-242 on ischemic
brain, infarct size and neurologic function were measured 24
hours after cerebral I/R or sham surgery. As shown in Figure 2, our
data showed that treatment with TAK-242 signiﬁcantly reduced
brain infarct size and signiﬁcantly improved neurologic function
showed that treatment with TAK-242 has a neuroprotective effect
at the acute stage after cerebral I/R.
As described previously, in the TLR4-mediated pathway,
activated TLR4 increases the phosphorylation of downstream
kinase, p-IKKα/β, which then induces the phosphorylation of IκBα,
and results in the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B
and regulates immune/inﬂammatory responses.5 Our data showed
that p-IKKα/β and p-IκBα signiﬁcantly increased in ischemic brain
tissue compared with sham controls, and treatment with TAK-242
inhibited the phosphorylation of IKKα/β and IκBα. The results
showed that treatment with TAK-242 can block the activation of
TLR4 signaling in brain tissue induced by cerebral I/R.
Our data also showed that, the levels of soluble tumor necrosis
factor receptor I, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor II, KC,
granulocyte colony–stimulating factor, interleukin-6, monocyte
chemotactic protein-1, MIP-1γ, and TIMP-1, and the expression of
COX-2 and MMP-9 signiﬁcantly increased in ischemic brain
compared with sham controls (P o 0.05, Figures 3–6). Previous
studies have shown that these cytokines are associated with
ischemia-induced inﬂammatory responses, ischemic damage, and
brain repair after cerebral I/R.25–35 For example, interleukin-6 is
increased in the acute phase of stroke, and is considered a robust
early marker for outcome in acute ischemic stroke.28 Monocyte
chemotactic protein-1, MIP-1γ, and TIMP-1 play important roles in
inﬂammatory processes and contribute to the pathogenesis of
brain injury and neurologic dysfunction.31–34 Moreover, MMP
family and COX are mediated by TLR4 signaling and involved in
the progression of neuronal damage after cerebral ischemia.34,35
Our data showed that treatment with TAK-242 signiﬁcantly
reduced the levels of sTNF RII, monocyte chemotactic protein-1,
MIP-1γ, TIMP-1, and the expression of MMP-9 and COX-2. The
results show that administration of TAK-242 blocks TLR4mediadted signaling and inhibits in situ inﬂammatory responses
induced by cerebral I/R.
A limitation of the present study is that the tissues for assays on
the concentrations of TAK-242 and the expression of inﬂammatory
cytokines in brain tissue were harvested from entire cerebral
hemisphere instead of speciﬁc brain tissues, such as cortex, striatum,
and hippocampus. If the assays were performed in the individual

cerebral structures, more detailed information about the distribution
of TAK-242 in brain tissue and its effects on inﬂammatory responses
in speciﬁc cerebral areas would be provided.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our data can be interpreted to show that TAK-242 can
pass through the BBB and distribute in the nonischemic brain tissue
and ischemic brain tissue in mice, and that administration of
TAK-242 protects the brain from damage at the acute stage after
cerebral I/R by inhibiting TLR4-mediated signaling and mediating
the expression of inﬂammatory cytokines. These novel ﬁndings have
the potential to lead to a new medication for ischemic stroke.
