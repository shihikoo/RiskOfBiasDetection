BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Recent ﬁndings suggest the importance of inﬂammation in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischaemia and its potential as a
therapeutic target. Cinnamaldehyde is a diterpene with a wide range of anti-inﬂammatory effects thus may be advantageous in
the treatment of cerebral ischaemia. The present study examined the potential therapeutic effects of cinnamaldehyde on cerebral
ischaemia using a mouse model with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Male CD-1 mice, which had the middle cerebral artery occluded, were treated (i.p.) with cinnamaldehyde. Neuroprotection by
cinnamaldehyde was analysed by evaluating neurological deﬁcit scores, brain oedema and infarct volume. Expressionsof signal
transduction molecules and inﬂammatory mediators were measured by Western blotting, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical
staining. Activation of NF-κB was assessed by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence.

KEY RESULTS
Cinnamaldehyde reduced the neurological deﬁcit scores, brain oedema and infarct volume. Cinnamaldehyde suppressed the
activation of signal transduction molecules including toll-like receptor 4, tumour necrosis receptor-associated factor 6 and NF-κB,
attenuated the increased levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, CCL2 and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and ultimately reduced
leukocyte inﬁltration into the ischaemic brain areas after cerebral ischaemia.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
Cinnamaldehyde protects against cerebral ischaemia injury by inhibiting inﬂammation, partly mediated by reducing the
expression of toll-like receptor 4, tumour necrosis receptor-associated factor 6 and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Our
ﬁndings suggest that cinnamaldehyde may serve as a new candidate for further development as a treatment for stroke.

Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most
frequent cause of permanent disability in adults worldwide
(Donnan et al., 2008). Thrombolysis is the only currently effective and available stroke therapy, but it is limited to a small
proportion of patients because of its narrow time window and
risk of intracranial haemorrhage. This emphasizes the need
for new therapeutic approaches to stroke treatment. Cerebral
ischaemia results in a cascade of pathophysiological events
including inﬂammation, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and
apoptosis (Moskowitz et al., 2010). Inﬂammatory response
has been conﬁrmed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of brain injury secondary to ischaemia (Danton and
Dietrich, 2003; Kleinig and Vink, 2009; Dong et al., 2013).
Many of the molecules involved in inﬂammatory response
are potential therapeutic targets for stroke. Therefore, it is
believed that pharmacological inhibition of the inﬂammatory response is one of the promising approaches for stroke
therapy.
Activation of NF-κB induced by the toll-like receptors (TLRs)
has been recognized as a key contributor to the pro-inﬂammatory
response (Medzhitov, 2001). Activation of TLRs triggers the
downstream stimulation of NF-κB and the induction of genes
that encode inﬂammation-associated molecules and cytokines
(O’Neill, 2003; Akira and Takeda, 2004). Accumulating evidence
suggests that TLRs and NF-κB are important mediators in cerebral
ischaemic inﬂammatory injury (Caso et al., 2007; Downes and
Crack, 2010; Wang et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2012). We have also
shown that several TLRs, such as TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9,
played a pivotal role in the inﬂammatory response following
cerebral ischaemia (Fan et al., 2009; Qiao et al., 2012; Zhang
et al., 2013). Tumour necrosis factor receptor-associated factor
6 (TRAF6) is a critical signalling adapter and acts downstream
of the TLRs (Kobayashi et al., 2004). All of these results suggest
that TLRs and the downstream signalling molecules such as
TRAF6 and NF-κB can be excellent therapeutic targets for
ischaemic stroke.
Cinnamaldehyde (CA), the major constituent of the
essential oil of Cassia bark, is a safe, widely used ﬂavouring
agent in food stuffs such as beverages, ice cream, sweets
and chewing gum. Cinnamaldehyde has been reported to
suppress TLR4-dependent inﬂammation in vitro (Youn et al.,
5010

British Journal of Pharmacology (2015) 172 5009–5023

2008). Recent studies further suggested that cinnamaldehyde
exerted a protective effect on myocardial ischaemia damage
in vivo. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to assess
the potential anti-inﬂammatory and neuroprotective effect
of cinnamaldehyde in a mouse model of permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and whether this therapeutic beneﬁt was associated with the activation of TLR4,
TRAF6 and NF-κB.

Methods
Animal preparation and pMCAO
All animal care and experimental procedures were approved by
the Animal Care and Management Committee of Second Hospital
of Hebei Medical University (permit number HMUSHC-130318).
All studies involving animals were reported in accordance with
the ARRIVE guidelines for reporting experiments involving
animals (Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath et al., 2010). A total of
230 male CD-1 mice (25–30 g) purchased from the Vital River,
Beijing, China, were kept on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with free
access to food and water, and they were allowed to acclimatize the
new surrounding for at least 3 days before using in experiments.
Animals were anaesthetized by i.p. injection of 10% chloral
hydrate (400 mg·kg 1; Yongda Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.,
Tianjin, China). Body temperature was monitored and maintained at 36.5 to 37.5 °C. A standard model of intraluminal
middle cerebral artery occlusion was used to make permanent
focal ischaemia by intraluminal placement of a ﬁlament (Beijing
Shadong BioTechnoiogiies Co., Ltd.), as described previously
(Longa et al., 1989). Sham-operated control mice received the
same procedure except ﬁlament insertion. To conﬁrm successful
blockade of the artery, an optic ﬁbre was glued to the skull
(1 mm posterior and 3 mm lateral to bregma) and connected to
a laser Doppler ﬂowmeter (moorVMS-LDF, Moor Instruments
Ltd., Axminster, Devon, UK) for monitoring the relative
regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) in the core territory of the
right middle cerebral artery. The rCBF, as measured by a ﬂexible
probe and laser Doppler ﬂowmetry, decreased by 85–95% in
this mouse model of pMCAO.

Effect of cinnamaldehyde on cerebral ischaemic damage

Experimental groups
Cinnamaldehyde (Aike Biotechnology Co, Chengdu, Sichuan,
China) with purity of more than 98% was dissolved in saline
including 0.2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). All the mice were
randomly divided into seven groups using a random number
table generated by the SPSS software 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) as described (Jiang et al., 2014): in preliminary experiments,
sham groups: mice received sham operation with equal volume
of normal sodium or 0.2% DMSO; MCAO groups: mice received
pMCAO with equal volume of normal sodium or 0.2% DMSO
and cinnamaldehyde groups: mice were treated i.p. with
cinnamaldehyde at 25 (CA25), 50 (CA50) and 75 mg·kg 1
(CA75), immediately after cerebral ischaemia and then once daily
thereafter. We found that neurological deﬁcit scores, brain water
content and infarct volume were comparable between mice
treated with saline and mice treated with 0.2% DMSO in sham
and MCAO groups (data not shown), so we could exclude the
biological effect of vehicle. Sham group (mice receiving sham operation with 0.2% DMSO, n = 42), MCAO group (mice received
MCAO with 0.2% DMSO, n = 54), CA25 group (n = 24), CA50
group (n = 54) and CA75 (n = 24) group were ﬁnally included
for the subsequent experiments. At 24 and 72 h after cerebral
ischaemia, mice were killed via rapid decapitation under deep
anaesthesia, and samples were collected for further study. To
further estimate the neuroprotective effect of cinnamaldehyde
administered at different time-points, one group of mice was
administered with cinnamaldehyde (50 mg·kg 1) at 1 h before,
4 or 8 h after cerebral ischaemia (n = 6 per time-point).

Neurological deficit scores
A neurological test was administered by the same examiner,
unaware of the experimental groups, at 24 and 72 h (n = 6
per group per time-point) after cerebral ischaemia following
a modiﬁed scoring system based on that developed from
Bederson (Bederson et al., 1986a) as follows: 0, normal motor
function; 1, contralateral forelimb weakness and torso turning to the ipsilateral side when held by tail; 2, circling to
affected side but normal posture at rest; 3, leaning to contralateral side at rest and 4, no spontaneous activity or barrel
rolling. The higher the neurological deﬁcit scores, the more
severe impairment of motor function.

(Bederson et al., 1986b) and followed by ﬁxation with 4%
paraformaldehyde. Normal tissue was stained deep red, while
the infarct area was stained pale grey. TTC-stained sections
were photographed, and the digital images were analysed
using image analysis software (Image-Pro Plus 5.1, Media
Cybernetics, Inc, Bethesda, MD, USA) to calculate the infarct
volume. To compensate for the effect of brain oedema, the
percentage hemisphere lesion volume was calculated by the
following formula (Tatlisumak et al., 1998): %HLV = {[total
infarct volume – (volume of intact ipsilateral hemisphere–
volume of intact contralateral hemisphere)]/contralateral
hemisphere volume} × 100%.

Immunohistochemical staining (IHC)
Parafﬁn-embedded sections were used to assess the expression of TLR4, TRAF6 and NF-κB, according to standard histological procedures, at 24 and 72 h after cerebral
ischaemia (n = 3 per group per time-point). Brain tissues
were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; 0.01 M, pH 7.4) over 24 h at 4 °C and then
dehydrated in a graded series of alcohols and embedded in
parafﬁn. Brain tissues were cut at 5 μm using a Leica®
RM1850 rotary microtome (Leica Microsystem, IL, Hesja,
Germany). Brain sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 to
eliminate the endogenous peroxidase activity, and 3% normal goat serum, then incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody of NF-κB (1:100, Bioworld Biotechnology), TRAF6
(1:100, Bioworld Biotechnology) and TLR4 (1:50, Bioworld
Biotechnology) in 0.01 M·L 1 PBS overnight at 4 °C. They
were rinsed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies at 37 °C for 45 min. They were rinsed again with
PBS and incubated with secondary biotinylated conjugates
at 37 °C. Slices were developed with diaminobenzidine and
counterstained with haematoxylin. The secondary antibodies, secondary biotinylated conjugates and diaminobenzidine from the streptavidin-peroxidase kit (Zhongshan
Biology Technology Company, Beijing, China) were used
to visualize the signals. The immunoreactive cells were
counted under a 400× light microscope in ﬁve visual ﬁelds
of the ischaemic cortex region around the infarct core. The
average number was used for statistical analysis and represented the immunopositive cells of that mouse.

Brain water content
Brain water content was observed using the standard wet–dry
method at 24 and 72 h after cerebral ischaemia (n = 6 per
group per time-point) (Hatashita et al., 1988). After dissecting
free 3 mm of frontal pole, a coronal brain slice (approximately
2 mm thick) was cut, and the slice was divided into ipsilateral
and contralateral hemispheres. The two hemispheres packaged respectively with tinfoil, wet weights measured and
then dried in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h to provide the dry
weights. Brain water content was then calculated as follows:
(wet weight–dry weight)/(wet weight) × 100%.

Brain infarct volume
Infarct volume after cerebral ischaemia was determined by
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 24 and 72 h after cerebral ischaemia (n = 6 per group per time-point). Brain
tissue was sliced into ﬁve coronal sections (2 mm thick),
stained with a 2% solution of TTC at 37 °C for 20 min

Western blotting
Protein extraction was obtained from the cortex using a
total protein extraction kit and nuclear-cytosol extraction
kit (Applygen Technologies Inc., Beijing, China) following
the manufacturer’s protocols at 24 and 72 h after cerebral
ischaemia (n = 6 per group per time-point). Total protein
for TLR4, TRAF6 and nuclear protein for NF-κB were prepared. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent kit
(Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) with bovine serum albumin
as the standard. An equivalent amount of 50 μg total protein
samples, as well as 30 μg nuclear protein samples, was subjected to electrophoresis on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–
polyacrylamide gels for 45 min at 80 V followed by 100 min
at 100 Vand then transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membranes (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) for
2 h at 100 V. The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed

milk/PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TPBS) (10 mM Tris–HCl,
150 mM NaCL and 0.05% Tween-20) for 2 h at room temperature then incubated with the corresponding primary antibodies
(TLR4, 1:200, Bioworld Biotechnology; TRAF6, 1:500, Bioworld
Biotechnology and NF-κB, 1:500, Bioworld Biotechnology) at
4 °C overnight. GAPDH (1:1000, Bioworld Biotechnology) was
used as an internal control. The following day, membranes were
washed with TPBS (10 min × 3) each time and subsequently
incubated in TPBS containing ﬂuorescent labelling second antibodies (IRDye® 800-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:10 000
dilution, Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed three times with TPBS
(10 min × 3), and the relative density of bands was analysed on
an Odyssey infrared scanner (LICOR Bioscience, Lincoln, NE,
USA). Densitometric values were normalized with respect to
GAPDH immunoreactivity to correct for any loading and transfer differences among samples.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR)
The qRT-PCR was used to analyse the mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-1β,
CCL2, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1),
TLR4, TRAF6 and NF-κB at 24 and 72 h after cerebral ischaemia
(n = 6 per group per time-point). Mice were anaesthetized, and
the brains were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total
RNAwas extracted from ischaemic cortex using the Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and was reverse-transcribed into
cDNA using revert aid ﬁrst strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas
International Inc., Burlington, Canada) for qRT-PCR (MX 3005P,
USA) in the presence of a ﬂuorescent dye (SYBR Green I, Cwbio).
Absorbance was read at 260 and 280 nm using an UV spectrophotometer. Only RNA samples with an OD260/OD280 value > 1.8
were considered appropriate for use. The mRNA level was normalized to the GAPDH RNA and was calculated by the 2 ΔΔCt
method. The primer sequences are as follows: TLR4 forward

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assay
Brain cortices were collected at 24 and 72 h after cerebral
ischaemia (n = 6 per group per time-point). The samples were
rinsed, weighed and then homogenized in 19 volumes of
9 g·L 1 ice-cold saline for 10 min using a Dounce tissue grinder
(Kimble and Kontes, Vineland, NJ, USA). Supernatant homogenate was collected after centrifugation at 4000× g for 10 min at
4 °C. The kit (A003, Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute,
5012

British Journal of Pharmacology (2015) 172 5009–5023

Nanjing, China) was selected for MPO activity measurement
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunofluorescence staining
Mice were anaesthetized by 10% chloral hydrate and
transcardially perfused with saline quickly followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS. Frozen coronal brain sections
(30 μm thick) were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100
for 10 min, blocked with 10% normal donkey serum for half
an hour at room temperature and then incubated with rabbit
anti-NF-κB (1:100, Bioworld Biotechnology) and mouse antiNeun (1:500, Millipore Corporation) or mouse anti-glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein (1:500, Millipore Corporation) or
goat anti-MPO (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight
at 4 °C. Slices were washed with PBS on the second day and incubated with anti-rabbit tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated
secondary antibody (1:200, Zhongshan Biology Technology
Company, Beijing, China), anti-mouse or anti-goat FITCconjugated secondary antibody (1:600, Zhongshan Biology
Technology Company) for 2 h. In order to identify the nucleus,
brain sections were counterstained with Hoechst 33342
(10 μg·mL 1) for 15 min. To acquire colour images, a 20× laser
scanning confocal microscope (Olympus FV10-ASW, Tokyo, Japan) was used.

Data analysis
Results are expressed as means ± SEM, except for the neurological scores and mortality. Statistical analysis was performed by the SPSS software 13.0 software (SPSS Inc.).
Statistical comparisons were performed by one-way ANOVA
followed by Student–Newman–Keuls tests for multiple comparisons. For neurological scores, data were analysed by the
chi-square (χ 2) method followed by the Mann–Whitney U test
for comparisons between two groups. The mortality of mice
after cerebral ischaemia was assessed with the chi-square
(χ 2) method. G*POWER 3.1.9.2 software (http://www.gpower.
hhu.de/ﬁleadmin/redaktion/Fakultaeten/MathematischNaturwissenschaftliche_Fakultaet/Psychologie/AAP/gpower/
GPowerWin_3.1.9.2.zip) was used to calculate the sample
size. Differences with P < 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
Cinnamaldehyde reduced the neurological
deficit scores, brain oedema and infarct volume
after cerebral ischaemia
A total of 14 mice died before completion of the experiment
and were excluded from the study: ﬁve mice (9.3%) in MCAO
group, three mice (12.5%) in the CA25 group, four mice
(7.4%) in the CA50 group and two mice in CA75 (8.3%). Post
mortem examinations did not reveal the occurrence of intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage in any of these animals, and no signiﬁcant differences were found among the
number of deaths of each group.
To investigate whether cinnamaldehyde could attenuate
cerebral ischaemia injury, we determined the neurological
deﬁcit scores, brain water content and infarct volume at 24

and 72 h after cerebral ischaemia. Compared with MCAO
group, there was a signiﬁcant improvement in neurological
deﬁcit scores in the CA50 and CA75 groups (P < 0.05), but
no signiﬁcant changes was shown in the scores of the CA25
group (P > 0.05). The neurological deﬁcit scores of each group
at 24 h after cerebral ischaemia were shown in Table 1.
Brain oedema in the ischaemic hemisphere of each group
was shown in Figure 1A. Compared with MCAO group, there
was a signiﬁcant reduction in brain water content in the
CA75 group (P < 0.05; n = 6 per time-point), and in the
CA50 group (P < 0.05; n = 6 per time-point), but there was
no signiﬁcant reduction of brain oedema in the CA25 group
(P > 0.05).
The infarct volume of each group at 24 h after cerebral
ischaemia was shown in Figure 1B. In MCAO group, an extensive lesion was found in both striatum and cortex (Figure1C).
In agreement with neurological deﬁcit scores and brain water
content, compared with MCAO group, cinnamaldehyde
reduced the infarct volume in a dose-dependent manner with
a signiﬁcant therapeutic effect in the CA75 group (P < 0.05)
and the CA50 group (P < 0.05), but not in the CA25 group
(Figure 1C).
Because these results demonstrated therapeutic effects at
50 and 75 mg·kg 1 cinnamaldehyde, we used the 50 mg·kg 1
dose in all subsequent studies.
To further estimate the neuroprotective effect of CA, one group
of mice was treated with cinnamaldehyde (50 mg·kg 1) at different
time-points (1 h before and 4 or 8 h after cerebral ischaemia). The
infarct volume of mice treated at 1 h before cerebral ischaemia,
0 h after and 4 h after cerebral ischaemia was signiﬁcantly smaller

than that in MCAO group at 24 h after cerebral ischaemia (P <
0.05 for all, Figure 1D). Similarly, the neurological deﬁcit scores
of mice treated at 1 h before cerebral ischaemia and at 0 or 4 h after
cerebral ischaemia were signiﬁcantly decreased compared with
those in the MCAO group (P < 0.05 for all). However, compared
with the MCAO group, there was no signiﬁcant decrease in infarct
volume and neurological deﬁcit scores when cinnamaldehyde was
administered at 8 h after cerebral ischaemia (P > 0.05).

Cinnamaldehyde reduced the mRNA levels of
inflammatory mediators
The mRNA levels of the cytokines, TNF-α and IL-1β, the
chemokine CCL2 and the adhesion molecules (ELAM-1) were
assayed. At 24 h after cerebral ischaemia, all the values of
inﬂammatory mediators measured were signiﬁcantly higher
than that in the sham group (P < 0.05), and all these effects
were partly reversed by treatment with cinnamaldehyde
(Figures 2A–2D). At 72 h after cerebral ischaemia, the mRNA
levels of TNF-α, CCL2 and ELAM-1 were higher than that in
the sham group, and cinnamaldehyde reduced the mRNA
levels of TNF-α and CCL2. However, the levels of IL-1β and
ELAM-1 in the CA50 group showed no signiﬁcant difference
from those of the MCAO group, at 72 h after cerebral ischaemia (Figures 2A–2D).

Cinnamaldehyde reduced leukocyte infiltration
To determine whether cinnamaldehyde could reduce leukocyte inﬁltration into the ischaemic area, we quantiﬁed the

expression in the ischaemic cortex. The MPO-positive cells of
each group at 24 h after cerebral ischaemia are shown in
Figure 3A. The number of MPO-positive cells was signiﬁcantly decreased in the CA50 group at 24 and 72 h after cerebral ischaemia (P < 0.05, Figure 3B). MPO activity is a good
indicator of inﬂammation and neutrophil accumulation
and can be quantiﬁed by the MPO activity assay (Barone
et al., 1992; Jiang et al., 1995). MPO activity in the ischaemic
cortex was also reduced in the CA50 group at 24 and 72 h
after cerebral ischaemia (P < 0.05, Figure 3C). Western
blotting analysis demonstrated that ischaemia caused an
increase in MPO levels in the right cortex at 24 and 72 h after
cerebral ischaemia, whereas cinnamaldehyde attenuated
such increases (Figures 3D and 3E).

Cinnamaldehyde suppressed the expression of

The localization of TLR4, TRAF6 and NF-κB was identiﬁed by immunohistochemistry at 24 and 72 h after cerebral ischaemia, and

TRAF6 and NF-κB. The immunohistochemical staining of TLR4,
TRAF6 and NF-κB of each group at 24 h after cerebral ischaemia
was shown in Figures 4A–4C. Few cells were stained for TLR4,
TRAF6 and NF-κB in the cortex in sham group. Compared with
the sham group, the number of cells positive for TLR4, TRAF6
and NF-κB in the MCAO group was signiﬁcantly increased at 24
and 72 h after cerebral ischaemia (P < 0.05); in these cells, NF-κ
B was located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. As
expected, compared with the MCAO group, the number of cells
positive for TLR4, TRAF6 and NF-κB in the CA50 group was
signiﬁcantly decreased at 24 and 72 h after cerebral ischaemia
(P < 0.05). Moreover, the number of nuclei positive for NF-κB
was also reduced and many of the cells labelled by NF-κB were
stained only in the cytoplasm (Figures 4D–4F).
Then, we further analysed the protein expressions of total
TLR4, TRAF6 and nuclear NF-κB with Western blotting.
Figures 5A–5C showed the protein levels of total TLR4, TRAF6
and nuclear/cytosolic NF-κB in different groups at 24 h after cerebral ischaemia. In agreement with the immunohistochemical
results, Western blotting also showed a signiﬁcant decrease of
total protein of TLR4 and TRAF6, and nuclear NF-κB in the
CA50 group at 24 and 72 h after cerebral ischaemia (P < 0.05,

Discussion and conclusions
The location and translocation of NF-κB in
neurons, astrocytes and neutrophils after
cerebral ischaemia
We examined the expressions of NF-κB in neurons, astrocytes and
neutrophils. In the sham group, NF-κB was detectable in few
neurons, almost no in astrocytes and neutrophils, and most cells
labelled by NF-κB were stained only in cytoplasm. In the MCAO
group, the expression of NF-κB was mainly in the neurons, few
in the astrocytes and neutrophils and most of neuron NF-κB

involve the down-regulation of the TLR4/TRAF6/NF-κB signalling
pathway.
Cinnamaldehyde is a diterpene found in considerable
quantities in the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia (He
et al., 2005) and exhibits anti-inﬂammatory action in vitro
(Reddy et al., 2004; Youn et al., 2008; Ho et al., 2013).
Cinnamaldehyde also protected against cardiac ischaemia
injury by inhibiting inﬂammation in vivo (Hwa et al.,
2012) and a recent study showed that cinnamaldehyde provided neuroprotection in inﬂammation-mediated neurodegenerative diseases (Pyo et al., 2013). All of these ﬁndings
strongly suggested that cinnamaldehyde may be a therapeutic candidate for inﬂammation-mediated cerebral
ischaemia injury. In our study, we have demonstrated that
cinnamaldehyde signiﬁcantly reduced neurological deﬁcit
scores, brain oedema and infarct volume after cerebral
ischaemia, in our mouse model. Nevertheless, we are aware
that the effect of cinnamaldehyde on cerebral ischaemia

should be further studied in a larger number of animals
and in other higher-order species, with different animal
models of cerebral ischaemia.
Several studies have revealed that a therapeutic window of approximately 6 h exists between the onset of ischaemia and
irreversible neuronal death (Williams et al., 2004; Xu et al.,
2006). Neuroprotective agents are aimed at salvaging or delaying
the infarction of the still-viable ischaemic penumbra. Therefore,
it is desirable that neuroprotective interventions should be
attempted before a stroke occurs or very soon afterward. In our
study, we found that cinnamaldehyde had neuroprotective effects when administered, not only immediately after cerebral
ischaemia, but also 1 h before ischaemia or 4 h after the onset
of ischaemia. Cinnamaldehyde administered 8 h after ischaemia
offered no signiﬁcant protection, suggesting that early treatment was important for a beneﬁcial outcome. Although we have
presented a considerable amount of data showing the efﬁcacy
of cinnamaldehyde, more detailed studies of dose-response

relationships, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability are still
needed before this compound could be tested in a larger sample.
Moreover, other routes of administration, more detailed timecourses and the long-term effects of cinnamaldehyde on cerebral
ischaemia still need further study.
The inﬂammatory response plays an important role in the
secondary injury following cerebral ischaemia. Brain ischaemic injury is undoubtedly associated with the expression of
inﬂammatory mediators such as inﬂammatory cytokines,
chemokine and adhesion molecules (Zheng and Yenari,
5018

British Journal of Pharmacology (2015) 172 5009–5023

2004). Inﬂammatory cytokines or chemokines form immediately after the onset of cerebral ischaemia, stimulate the
expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells and cause the adherence and extravasation of
leukocytes into brain parenchyma (Barone and Feuerstein,
1999). From previous studies of cerebral ischaemia, it appears
that TNF-α, IL-1β, CCL2 and ELAM-1 are well established
molecules, highly relevant the inﬂammatory response and
appear to exacerbate cerebral ischaemic injury (Wang et al.,
1995; Barone et al., 1997; Hughes et al., 2002; Mulcahy

et al., 2003). In our study, a certain number of factors related
to inﬂammatory response, such as inﬂammatory cytokines
(IL-1β and TNF-α), chemokines (CCL2) and adhesion molecules (ELAM-1), were induced by ischaemia and inhibited
by cinnamaldehyde, indicating that the neuroprotective
efﬁcacy of cinnamaldehyde could be attributed, at least in
part, to its anti-inﬂammatory activities. This is in agreement
with previous reports of the anti-inﬂammatory effects of
cinnamaldehyde, in vitro and in vivo (Ho et al., 2013; Pyo
et al., 2013).
Inﬂammation in stroke has been traditionally identiﬁed,
in histopathological terms, as neutrophil inﬁltration (Weston
et al., 2007). MPO is the most abundant component in
azurophilic granules of neutrophils and has been used

extensively as a marker for quantifying neutrophil inﬁltration (Rausch et al., 1978; Weston et al., 2006). MPO is also a
key ﬁnﬂammatory enzyme mainly secreted by activated neutrophils in the ischaemic tissues and can generate highly reactive oxygen species to cause additional damage in cerebral
ischaemia (Breckwoldt et al., 2008). Recent studies indicated
that cinnamaldehyde inhibited N-formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine-induced inﬂammatory inﬁltration of neutrophils in vitro (Lee et al., 2009). By using immunohistochemistry,
Western blotting and the biochemical assay, we observed that
MPO activity and expression increased over time from 24 to
72 h after MCAO, in the ischaemic area, similar to earlier ﬁndings (Weston et al., 2007; Breckwoldt et al., 2008) and that
cinnamaldehyde signiﬁcantly reduced acute neutrophil

inﬁltration, indicating that this compound did modify the
acute inﬂammatory processes of neutrophil recruitment,
following cerebral ischaemia.
The TLRs are the key host molecules in the regulation of
the inﬂammatory response during CNS damage (Medzhitov,
2001). TLRs can recognize endogenous danger-associated
molecular patterns associated with tissue stress or injury that
lead to the initiation of the inﬂammatory response
(Medzhitov, 2001; Matzinger, 2002). So far, 11 human and
13 mouse TLRs have been identiﬁed, and TLR4 is recognized
as an important component of the innate immunity of the
CNS (Lehnardt et al., 2002). TLR4 also participates in the
cerebral injury following ischaemic stroke (Caso et al., 2007;
Kilic et al., 2008). TLR4 signalling pathway consists of a
5020

British Journal of Pharmacology (2015) 172 5009–5023

MyD88-dependent and a MyD88-independent pathways
(Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009). In the more common
MyD88-dependent pathway, the IL-1 receptor-associated
kinase (IRAK) is recruited to TLR4 through interaction with
MyD88. IRAK is activated by phosphorylation and then associates with TRAF6, leading to the activation of downstream
signalling pathways, including MAPKs and NF-κB (Akira and
Takeda, 2004). A critical role of NF-κB is to regulate the genes
that encode inﬂammation-associated molecules and cytokines (Kim et al., 2009; Chan et al., 2010). Cinnamaldehyde
suppressed lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of TLR4
pro-inﬂammatory signalling and inhibited the expression of
high mobility group box 1, an endogenous ligand of TLR4
(Youn et al., 2008; Hwa et al., 2012). Cinnamaldehyde blocked

the over-expression of TLR4 and TRAF6 in macrophages
(Zhao et al., 2008). Cinnamaldehyde also regulated NF-κB
activation by reacting with the free sulfhydryl groups of
cysteine (Heiss et al., 2001). Therefore, we wanted to know
whether the therapeutic beneﬁt of cinnamaldehyde was associated with the TLR4/TRAF6/NF-κB signalling pathway in our
mouse model of pMCAO. We found that cinnamaldehyde
inhibited the expression of TLR4 and TRAF6 and the nuclear
translocation of NF-κB after cerebral ischaemia, suggesting
that the action of cinnamaldehyde could take place upstream
of the activation of TLR4. We also observed the location of
NF-κB in three different types of cells including neurons, residential inﬂammatory cells, such as astrocytes, and inﬁltrated
inﬂammatory cells, such as neutrophils. We found that NF-κB
was expressed mainly in neurons, with little expression in astrocytes and neutrophils. This is in accordance with earlier
results showing that NF-κB was activated after cerebral ischaemia, in neurons, astrocytes and inﬁltrating inﬂammatory
cells (Ridder and Schwaninger, 2009). Thus, it is possible that
cinnamaldehyde might cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) to
exert anti-inﬂammatory effects, in the CNS. The action of
cinnamaldehyde could take place upstream of the activation
of TLR4 to inhibit the expression of TLR4/TRAF6 and nuclear
translocation of NF-κB. However, cinnamaldehyde has exhibited a wide range of anti-inﬂammatory effects in other pathologies. Does cinnamaldehyde exert its major effects by
crossing BBB or by acting on circulating peripheral cells?
Does cinnamaldehyde act through a completely different
signalling pathway? Further research is still needed to understand the effects of cinnamaldehyde on the structure and
function of the BBB, circulating peripheral cells and other
signalling pathways.
In TLR4/TRAF6/NF-κB pathway, as a critical signalling adapter
molecule at the central convergence of different signal pathways,

TRAF6 leads to the activation of downstream signalling pathways
such as MAPKs and NF-κB cascades. Miyahara et al. (2004)
showed that an inﬂammatory signalling pathway containing
TRAF6 contributed to intimal lesion formation in arterial injury
model, indicating that TRAF6-mediated signalling pathway
might act as a therapeutic target for the treatment of vascular
occlusive disease (Miyahara et al., 2004). Recently, TRAF6 was
demonstrated to participate in the pathogenesis of cerebral
ischaemia (Liu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013). In our present
study, the high level of TRAF6 following cerebral ischaemia was
decreased by cinnamaldehyde, implying that TRAF6 was
positively correlated with cerebral ischaemic injury and might
be a novel therapeutic target for ischaemic stroke. The neuroprotective mechanism of cinnamaldehyde was at least in part linked
to TRAF6 inhibition. However, the extent of the relationship
between TRAF6 and ischaemic stroke, even TRAF6 and
inﬂammation-related disease, needs further research.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that cinnamaldehyde
may improve neurological deﬁcit, alleviate brain oedema and
reduce brain infarct volume by inhibiting the inﬂammatory
response and this may occur by reducing the expression of
TLR4and TRAF6, and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB
(Figure 7). Our ﬁndings suggest that cinnamaldehyde may serve
as a novel candidate for stroke treatment.
