Objective: Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases (CYP) metabolize arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic acids
(EETs), which exhibit vasodilatory, anti-inﬂammatory and neuroprotective actions in experimental cerebral ischemia. We evaluated the effect of endothelial-speciﬁc CYP overexpression on cerebral blood ﬂow, inﬂammatory
cytokine expression and tissue infarction after focal cerebral ischemia in transgenic mice.
Approach and results: Male and female wild-type and transgenic mice overexpressing either human CYP2J2 or
CYP2C8 epoxygenases in vascular endothelium under control of the Tie2 promoter (Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2CYP2C8) were subjected to 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Microvascular cortical perfusion
was monitored during vascular occlusion and reperfusion using laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry and optical imaging. Infarct size and inﬂammatory cytokines were measured at 24 h of reperfusion by TTC and real-time quantitative
PCR, respectively. Infarct size was signiﬁcantly reduced in both Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8 transgenic male
mice compared to corresponding WT male mice (n = 10 per group, p b 0.05). Tie2-CYP2J2, but not Tie2CYP2C8 male mice maintained higher blood ﬂow during MCAO; however, both Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8
had lower inﬂammatory cytokine expression after ischemia compared to corresponding WT males (n = 10
per group for CBF and n = 3 for cytokines, p b 0.05). In females, a reduction in infarct was observed in the
caudate-putamen, but not in the cortex or hemisphere as a whole and no differences were observed in blood
ﬂow between female transgenic and WT mice (n = 10 per group).
Conclusions: Overexpression of CYP epoxygenases in vascular endothelial cells protects against experimental
cerebral ischemia in male mice. The mechanism of protection is in part linked to enhanced blood ﬂow and
suppression of inﬂammation, and is both sex- and CYP isoform-speciﬁc.

1. Introduction

membranes as part of their phospholipid pool (Liu et al., 2004). Free AA
is released into cytosol upon stimulation by endogenous agonists,
pharmacological agents and following injury, such as ischemic injury,

where it is metabolized into biologically active eicosanoids by one of
three enzymatic pathways: the cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase
(LOX) or cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) pathway. There are
two broad classes of CYP enzymes involved in eicosanoid formation:
1) the hydroxylases, which form 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a
vasoconstrictor in the cerebral and coronary circulation; and 2) the
epoxygenases, which form epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which
are vasodilators and protective against ischemic brain and heart
injury by multiple mechanisms. In addition to vasodilation, EETs possess
anti-inﬂammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidant properties (Spector
and Norris, 2007). In the brain, EETs are produced by astrocytes
(Alkayed et al., 1996), vascular endothelium (Medhora et al., 2001)
and perivascular nerves (Iliff et al., 2007), where they have been

76

implicated in functional hyperemia following neuronal activation
(Alkayed et al., 1997; Harder et al., 1998). Interestingly, CYP
epoxygenase upregulation in brain after ischemic preconditioning has
been associated with tissue protection with no change in blood ﬂow
(Alkayed et al., 2002), suggesting that EETs may exert a neuroprotective
effect that is independent from its established vasodilator effect. In
contrast, stabilizing endogenous EETs by deleting their metabolizing
enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is protective against ischemic
injury, and protection is clearly associated with increased vasodilation
in response to focal cerebral ischemia (Zhang et al., 2008). Whether
different regioisomers of EETs have different mechanisms of action
and may account for these apparent differences following ischemia
(neuroprotection versus vasodilation) is not well understood. Also, the
contribution of EETs derived from different cell types to protection
following ischemia has not been fully elucidated.
To determine the contribution of endothelial-derived EETs to protection following ischemia, we compared brain infarct and cerebral
blood ﬂow (CBF) during middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in
transgenic mice overexpressing one of two human CYP epoxygenase
isoforms, hCYP2J2 or hCYP2C8, in vascular endothelium. Our ﬁndings
suggest that overexpression of CYP epoxygenase in vascular endothelium protects against experimental cerebral ischemia. The mechanism of
protection is in part linked to enhanced blood ﬂow and suppression of
inﬂammation, and is both sex- and CYP isoform-speciﬁc.
2. Materials and methods
The study was conducted in accordance with the National Institutes
of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals in research, and
protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
Oregon Health and Science University (Portland, OR, USA).
2.1. Animals
Transgenic mice expressing either the human CYP2J2 or CYP2C8
epoxygenase in vascular endothelium under the control of the murine
Tie2 promoter (2-kb) and full enhancer (10-kb) were generated on
a C57Bl/6 background. We used heterozygous Tie2-CYP2J2, Tie2CYP2C8 transgenic mice and age- and sex-matched WT littermate controls. Genotype was determined in each mouse by PCR of tail genomic
DNA. Generation of Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8 mice, founder lines,
breeding and genotyping protocols have been previously described
(Lee et al., 2010).
2.2. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Adult (25–28 g) male and female wild-type (WT), Tie2-CYP2J2 and
Tie2-CYP2C8 transgenic mice were subjected to 60-min middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) under isoﬂurane anesthesia, as described previously, with slight modiﬁcations (Zhang et al., 2008). Brieﬂy, mice were
anesthetized with isoﬂurane (induction 5%; maintenance 1.0%), and
kept warm with water pads. A small laser-Doppler probe was afﬁxed
to the skull to monitor cerebral cortical perfusion and verify vascular occlusion and reperfusion. A silicone-coated 6-0 nylon monoﬁlament was
inserted into the right internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery until laser-Doppler signal dropped to less than 20% of baseline. The
animal was maintained anesthetized with 1% isoﬂurane on the surgical
station for 60 min of occlusion. After reperfusion, mice were allowed to
recover and observed for 24 h. Infarct size was measured at 24 h after
MCAO in 2-mm thick coronal brain sections (ﬁve total) using 2, 3, 5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and digital image analysis.
Sections were incubated in 1.2% TTC in saline for 15 min at 37 °C, and
then ﬁxed in formalin for 24 h. Slices were photographed; infarcted
(unstained) and uninfarcted (red color) areas were measured with
MCID software (InterFocus Imaging Ltd., Linton, UK) and integrated
across all ﬁve slices. To account for the effect of edema, the infarcted

area was estimated indirectly by subtracting the uninfarcted area in
the ipsilateral hemisphere from the contralateral hemisphere, and expressing infarct volume as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere.
Cerebrocortical laser-Doppler perfusion (LDP) was monitored during
occlusion and early reperfusion. The laser-Doppler probe was positioned on bone over the dorsolateral parietal cortex 2 mm posterior,
3 mm lateral to the Bregma. The LDP signal was recorded continuously
and averaged over 15-min intervals for comparison among treatment
groups.
2.3. Optical microangiography (OMAG)
OMAG was performed as previously described (Zhang et al., 2009;
An et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2007). The mouse head was shaved before
OMAG imaging. During imaging, the mouse was immobilized on a
custom-made stereotaxic stage and lightly anesthetized with isoﬂurane
(0.2 l/min O2, 0.8 l/min air). Body temperature was kept at 35.5–36.5 °C
with a warming blanket and monitored by a rectal thermal probe
throughout the experiment. An incision of ~1 cm was made along the
sagittal suture, and the frontal parietal and interparietal bones were exposed by pulling the skin to the sides. The animal was then positioned
under the OMAG scanning probe, allowing for visualization and quantiﬁcation of blood ﬂow based on endogenous light scattering from moving blood cells within biologic tissue, with no need to use exogenous
contrasting agents. In the mouse, OMAG covers the entire thickness of
the cerebral cortex through an intact skull. OMAG was an optical coherence tomography based imaging technique capable of generating threedimensional images of functional vasculature in vivo and without the
need for dye injection (An et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2007). The OMAG
imaging system used in this study employed a superluminescent
diode with a central wavelength of 1310 nm and a full-width, halfmaximum bandwidth of 50 nm, providing an axial resolution of
~10 μm in tissue. The lateral resolution of the system was measured at
~15 μm. The spectral interferograms formed by the reference light and
the light backscattered from the tissue sample were detected by a
custom-built, high-resolution and high-speed spectrometer, upon
which the OMAG algorithm was applied to obtain angiographic images
representing functional cerebral microvasculature within the scanned
brain tissue. The three-dimensional scan represented a physical volume
with the following x–y–z dimensions: 2.5 × 2.5 × 2.0 mm3.
2.4. Isolation of cerebral vessels
Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoﬂurane and perfused
transcardially with pre-chilled heparinized saline (1 U/ml) before decapitation to remove blood from the cerebral circulation; brains were
then rapidly dissected. Pial and large cerebral vessels were removed
with ﬁne forceps and discarded. The remaining brain tissue was homogenized in ice-cold PBS with a loosely ﬁtting Dounce homogenizer, and
centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant, containing parenchymal brain tissue, was discarded; the pellet, containing vessels,
was resuspended in PBS and centrifuged at 2000g for another 5 min at
4 °C. The second pellet was resuspended in PBS, layered over a 15%
dextran density gradient (molecular weight 35,000–40,000 kDa), and
centrifuged in a swinging-bucket rotor for 30 min at 3500g at 4 °C.
The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in
PBS, and again layered over dextran and centrifuged for an additional
30 min at 3500g. The resulting pellet was washed with ice-cold PBS
over a 70 mm nylon mesh, cerebral microvessels and capillaries were
collected and stored at −80 °C.
2.5. Primary aortic endothelial cell isolation
Aorta from WT Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8 male mice were
harvested for isolation of endothelial cells, as described previously
(Lee et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, 3 aortas from each genotype were pooled,

J. Jia et al. / Experimental Neurology 279 (2016) 75–85

minced and digested with type-I collagenase (2 mg/ml, Worthington
Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) at 37 °C for 45 min.
Resultant homogenates were triturated with a 30-ml syringe, ﬁltered
through a 70-μm cell strainer, washed with PBS + 0.1% FBS and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 rpm. Cell pellets were re-suspended and incubated with magnetic Dynabeads (Invitrogen) coated with anti-CD31
antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Endothelial cells were isolated by magnetic separation and plated onto 0.1% gelatin-coated ﬂasks
in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 100 μg/ml heparin, 100 μg/ml
penicillin/streptomycin and 100 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA, USA). Once conﬂuent,
cells were trypsinized and further puriﬁed by incubation with antiCD102 (BD Biosciences) coated Dynabeads and grown to conﬂuence. 1
million endothelial cells were plated on 100 mm tissue culture dishes
and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated in serum free DMEM for 4 h. The cell-conditioned medium was
collected, the cells were then incubated for 10 min in fresh serum free
DMEM containing 10 μM Ca2+ ionophore (A23187, Sigma-Aldrich) to
stimulate arachidonic acid release. Both basal and stimulated medium
were collected and stored at −80 °C for MC/MS/MS analysis.
2.6. Quantiﬁcation of CYP-derived eicosanoids in medium
Epoxy and dihydroxy metabolites (EETs and DHETs) of arachidonic
acid were extracted and quantiﬁed; 11,12- and 14,15-regioiosomers
speciﬁcally were quantiﬁed as these are the primary metabolic products
synthesized by CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 (Zeldin et al., 1995; Wu et al., 1996).
These were extracted in cell culture medium by solid-phase extraction
and eluted in ethyl acetate, as described by Newman et al. (2002)
and Seubert et al. (2006). Oxylipids were separated by reverse-phase
HPLC on a 2- × 150-mm, 5-μm Luna C18 (2) column (Phenomenex,
Torrance, CA, USA) and quantiﬁed using a MDS Sciex API 3000 triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) with negative
mode electrospray ionization and multiple reaction monitoring, as previously described (Newman et al., 2002). Relative response ratios of
each analyte were used to calculate concentrations, quantiﬁcation relative to internal standards corrected for surrogate losses. Cell medium
concentrations were normalized to cell plating density.
2.7. Cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) collection and extraction
Plasma oxylipid levels were determined by liquid chromatography,
tandem mass spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS). Samples were collected from
the cisterna magna of naïve animals. Mice were anesthetized and placed
prone on a stereotaxic frame. A sagittal incision of the skin was made inferior to the occiput, the subcutaneous tissue and muscles separated and
the dura matter was penetrated with the 30G1 needle connected with
PE-10 tube. The CSF was drawn into PE-10 tubing with the careful suction by a 10 μl gastight syringe (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV, USA).
The CSF was injected into an Eppendorf tube, and frozen in a −80 °C
freezer until assayed. CSF samples (5–10 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of
0.1% acetic acid in 5% methanol, 10 μl of 0.4 mg/ml butylated hydroxytoluene, and spiked with 30 ng PGE2-d4, 10,11-DiHN, and 10,11EpHep (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) as internal standards.
Oxylipids were extracted 3 times with 1 ml ethyl acetate. Ethyl acetate
from each sample was pooled and dried under gentle nitrogen ﬂow.
Samples were reconstituted in 100 μl of 40% ethanol. Three injections
of 20 μl were analyzed for each sample. The triplicate sample injections
were averaged, corrected for volume of CSF, and represented as pg/μl.
Online liquid chromatography of extracted samples was performed
with an Agilent 1200 Series capillary HPLC (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) as previously described (Edin et al., 2011;
Newman et al., 2002). Separations were achieved using a Phenomenex
Luna C18(2) column (5 μm, 150 × 1 mm; Phenomenex, Torrance,
CA, USA), which was held at 40 °C. Mobile phase A was 85:15:0.1
water:acetonitrile:acetic acid. Mobile phase B was 70:30:0.1

77

acetonitrile:methanol:acetic acid. Gradient elution was used; mobile
phase percentage B and ﬂow rate were varied as follows: 0% B at
87.5 μl/min at 0 min, ramp from 0 to 2 min to 25% B at 87.5 μl/min,
ramp from 2 to 5 min to 50% B at 60 μl/min, ramp from 5 to 23 min
to 92.5% B at 60 μl/min, ramp from 23 to 23.5 min to 100% B at
87.5 μl/min, hold from 23.5 to 29 min at 100% B, ramp from 29 to
29.6 min down to 0% B, and hold 0% B to 33 min. Negative ion
electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was used for
detection. Analyses were performed on an MDS Sciex API 3000
equipped with a TurboIonSpray source (Applied Biosystems).
Turbo desolvation gas was heated to 275 °C at a ﬂow rate of
5.75 ml/min.

2.8. TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR
RNA was isolated from cerebral microvessels using RNAqueousMicro kit and reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit; resultant cDNA was ampliﬁed using TaqMan
Universal PCR Master Mix (all Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in the ABI
Prism 7000 sequence detection system. Quantitative PCR was performed in 96 well plate format using 50 μl total volume, with each
sample run in triplicate. PCR was also run on controls in which
template had not been added, in order to determine DNA contamination
and primerdimer formation. RNA with no reverse transcription
was also included to discount genomic DNA ampliﬁcation. TNFα
(Mm00443258_m1) and IL1-β (Mm00434228_m1) gene expression
assays (Life Technologies) were used and 18S was measured as an internal control using the 18S rRNA control kit FAM-TAMRA (Eurogentec SA,
Osaka, Japan). Relative quantiﬁcation analysis was performed using the
2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).

2.9. In situ hybridization
2.9.1. Cloning of human CYP 2C8 and 2J2
Fragments of the human CYP 2C8 and 2J2 gene were cloned by using
TOPO TA Cloning kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA). The forward primer (bases 869-888; 5′-CAA TCC TCG GGA CTT TAT CG-3′) and
reverse primer (bases 1182-1163; 5′-GGA CAA GGT CAC TGT ATC TC-3′)
for 2C8 were designed from the human 2C8 sequence (accession number NM_000770). The forward primer (bases 942-961; 5′ ACC GAG ACA
ACT TGG ACA AC-3′) and reverse primer (bases 1347-1328; 5′-ATG CCC
GCT TTC CTA TTG AG-3′) for 2J2 were designed from the human 2J2
sequence (accession number NM_000775). The CYP 2C8 and 2J2 fragments were ampliﬁed from aMHC-2C8 and aMHC-2J2 constructs. PCR
was conducted for 40 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 45 s), annealing
(61.6 °C, 45 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min). The resulting 314 bp
(2C8) and 406 bp (2 J2) products were subcloned into the pCR2.1TOPO vector (Invitrogen) using the TOPO TA cloning kit according to
the manufacturer's instruction. The pCR2.1-TOPO vector contains only
one promoter (T7), therefore, sense and antisense probes required
two separate vectors with the respective inserts in the correct orientation for sense and antisense synthesis. The vectors containing the inserts
were then sequenced to conﬁrm the direction for sense and antisense
probe synthesis.

2.9.2. Probe preparation
Radioactive antisense and sense cRNA probes were transcribed
in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase from the BamH1 linearized human
CYP 2C8 and 2J2 constructs in the presence of 35S-uridine 5′ (αthio)triphosphate (35S-UTP). Residual DNA was digested with 2 U
DNase I (Ambion Inc. Austin, Texas). The sense and antisense
RNA probes were puriﬁed on a G-50 Sephadex column (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).

2.9.3. Tissue preparation
Wild-type and transgenic animals were anesthetized, killed by
decapitation and the brains sliced into 2 mm coronal blocks through
the rostral forebrain. The brain blocks were ﬁxed by immersion in 4%
paraformaldehyde in Sorensen buffer (0.03 M; pH 7.4) for 6 h at 4 °C,
rinsed overnight in 20% buffered-sucrose solution (pH 7.4), embedded
in O.C.T. (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA), and frozen in isopentane at
− 55 °C. Coronal sections (20 μm) were cut on a cryostat and thaw
mounted onto Superfrost Plus glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
The sections were stored at −80 °C.

2.9.4. Hybridization
The slides were postﬁxed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in
Sorensen's phosphate buffer (0.03 M, pH 7.4) for 20 min, rinsed
with Sorenson's phosphate buffer, and treated with proteinase K
(1.0 μg/ml) for 4 min at room temperature. Sections were then treated
with 0.1 M triethanolamine (3 min), followed by 0.25% acetic anhydride
in 0.1 M triethanolamine (10 min) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO). Sections were prehybridized for 1 h at 58 °C with hybridization buffer
(50% formamide, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 100 μM
dithiothreitol [DTT], 200 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM Tris–HCl,

J. Jia et al. / Experimental Neurology 279 (2016) 75–85

pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 125 μg/ml tRNA; Sigma-Aldrich) and then
quickly rinsed in 2 × SSC buffer. The 35S-labeled antisense as well as
sense riboprobes were heat-denatured, diluted with hybridization buffer, and used at a ﬁnal concentration of 2 × 104 cpm/μl. Subsequently,
the sections were covered with glass coverslips, sealed, and hybridized
in a moist chamber for at least 18 h at 58 °C. After hybridization, the
slides were washed in 2 × SSC buffer at 62 °C four time with three
changes, reacted with RNAse (20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, and washed
in decreasing concentrations of SSC (2×, 1×, 0.5×, 0.25×) at 58 °C for
10 min each with three changes of each solution. Finally, the slides
were washed in 0.1× SSC with 1 mM DTT for 45 min at 58 °C. The slides
were dehydrated in 50%, 80% and 90% ethanol with 300 mM Ammonium Acetate followed by 100% ethanol for 2 min, placed side by side on
a ﬂat surface together with autoradiographic 14C microscales, and exposed to Hyperﬁlm-βmax (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for
6 days at 4 °C. The ﬁlms were developed in D19 developer for 5 min,
ﬁxed in Kodak ﬁxer for 5 min. The slides were then dipped in Kodak
NTB-2 nuclear track emulsion and exposed for 21 days at 4 °C. Thereafter, slides were developed in D19 developer for 2 min, ﬁxed in Kodak
ﬁxer for 5 min, counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and
coverslipped.
Film images were scanned (HP Scanjet 7400c) and digitized images
processed in Adobe Photoshop (Mountain View, CA) and Macromedia
FreeHand (San Francisco, CA). Contrast and brightness were adjusted
in scanned images of ﬁlms to compensate for uneven illumination in
brightﬁeld images. Images of emulsion-coated slides were analyzed
using a Nikon E800 microscope. Darkﬁeld and brightﬁeld images were
captured using a Nikon DS-L1 digital camera and illustrated in Adobe
Photoshop and Macromedia FreeHand software programs. Contrast
and brightness were adjusted in scanned images to match the original
image seen in the microscope.

in 1A), lateral ventricular area (LV) and olfactory cortex (CYP2J2)/optic
chiasm (CYP2C8), demonstrating vascular expression pattern for both
transgenes. Another difference observed in expression between
transgenes is the abundant expression of CYP2C8 in the choroid plexus,
which is absent for CYP2J2 (not shown).
3.2. Transgenic expression of CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 in endothelium is
protective against experimental stroke
To determine if endothelial expression of CYP2J2 or CYP2C8
epoxygenase alters outcome from experimental stroke, we compared
cortical and striatal (caudate-putamen, CP) infarcts in Tie2-CYP2J2 and
Tie2-CYP2C8 mice to those in WT, both in male and female mice. In
males, both cortical and striatal infarcts were signiﬁcantly smaller in
transgenic mice compared to WT littermates (Fig. 2A), with cortical infarct decreasing from 45.01 ± 3.1% of contralateral structure in WT to
25.75 ± 5.3% in Tie2-CYP2J2 and 22.10 ± 4.7% in Tie2-CYP2C8 mice.
In females, striatal infarct was reduced from 70.36 ± 5.4% of contralateral structure in WT to 55.24 ± 5.2% in Tie2-CYP2J2 and 55.43 ± 7.1%
in Tie2-CYP2C8 (Fig. 2B). However no reduction in infarct was observed
in either the cortex or the hemisphere as a whole.
No differences were observed in body weight, anesthesia requirement or body temperature between WT and transgenic mice.
3.3. Transgenic expression of CYP2J2 in endothelium increases collateral
blood ﬂow in male mice
To determine if the decrease in infarct size in Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2CYP2C8 transgenic mice was linked to increased CBF, we compared
laser-Doppler cortical perfusion (LDP) during MCAO between WT and
transgenic mice. Fig. 3A shows that in males, LDP during MCAO was signiﬁcantly higher in Tie2-CYP2J2 (19.76 ± 0.80% relative to baseline),

3. Results
3.1. Expression and distribution of human CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 transgenes
in mouse brain
In situ hybridization was used to determine endothelial expression
of human CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 in brains of Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2CYP2C8 female mice, respectively (Fig. 1). [35S]-labeled antisense and
sense cRNA probes prepared from the respective human sequences
were used. Antisense probes produced hybridization signal in transgenic but not in WT littermate brain, and sense probes did not generate signal in transgenic brains (WT and sense hybridization not shown),
indicating speciﬁcity of probe for the human transgenes. Localization
of CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 transgenes broadly follows the vascular distribution in brain, as shown in representative sections from rostral to caudal
forebrain in Fig. 1A (a–c for CYP2J2, d–f for CYP2C8). It is of note that
CYP2J2 mRNA is also expressed in ependymal cells lining the lateral or
third ventricle in contrast to CYP2C8 mRNA expression, which was limited to pial and parenchymal vessels. This can be clearly seen by comparing panels labeled c1 and c2 in Fig. 1B and C. Higher magniﬁcation
images are shown in 1B (CYP2J2) and 1C (CYP2C8), from top to bottom,

ischemia between WT (12.51 ± 0.35%) and either of the two transgenic
mouse lines (Fig. 3B). Following 5 min of reperfusion, LDP in males was
signiﬁcantly higher in Tie2-CYP2J2 (115.8 ± 6.8%) and Tie2-CYP2C8
(107.9 ± 5.7%) compared to WT (88.33 ± 6.1%). In females, LDP after
5 min of reperfusion was also elevated in Tie2-CYP2C8 mice (120 ±
10.6) compared to both WT (98.17 ± 6.0) and Tie2-CYP2J2 mice
(99.22 ± 5.9%).
We further carried out non-invasive optical microangiography
(OMAG) in male WT and Tie2-CYP2J2 mice. We chose to evaluate
microvascular perfusion in the CYP2J2 males as this was the only
group to display increased LDP during the time of occlusion (Fig. 3A).
We found that despite ﬁlament withdrawal and reperfusion through
proximal MCA branches (as indicated by the return in LDP to baseline
in Fig. 3A), distal microvascular perfusion was still impaired in the WT
ischemic hemisphere (I) at 24 h after MCAO (compared to contralateral
hemisphere, Fig. 3C). Importantly, male Tie2-CYP2J2 mice, as well as
demonstrating higher LDP during time of occlusion, were also protected
from delayed post-ischemic microvascular hypoperfusion.
To determine whether the protection enjoyed by male mice with
transgenic expression of CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 in endothelium was in
fact due to increased CYP activity, rather than an off target effect of
the transgene, infarct size and cortical perfusion after MCAO were measured in the presence of CYP inhibitor, MS-PPOH (Fig. 4). Male mice
were used since they displayed a more robust protection from MCAO
than females (Fig. 2). Mice were implanted with an osmotic pump containing 2.5 mg/ml MS-PPOH or vehicle (ethanol) prior to MCAO and

kept for 24 h after MCAO. Inhibition of CYP epoxygenase activity
abolished the protective effect of the transgenes in male mice, as infarct
size after MCAO was no longer different in Tie2-CYP2J2 or Tie2-CYP2C8
male mice compared to WT male mice (Fig. 4A). Similarly, no differences were observed in LDP during MCAO between transgenic and
WT mice (Fig. 4B).
3.4. Attenuation of post-ischemic inﬂammatory response in male mice with
endothelial expression of CYP2J2 and CYP2C8
Because male Tie2-CYP2C8 mice were protected from ischemic injury compared to WT control mice, yet there were no differences in cortical perfusion during occlusion between the two groups, we investigated
a possible anti-inﬂammatory mechanism of protection by CYP2C8.
Using rt-qPCR, we measured pro-inﬂammatory cytokine expression in
microvessels isolated from ischemic and contralateral hemispheres, as
well as from naïve brains of male WT, Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8
mice. We found that in WT mice, mRNA levels of both TNFα (Fig. 5A)
and IL1-β (Fig. 5B) are signiﬁcantly increased in microvessels from the
ipsilateral hemisphere 24 h following MCAO, compared to microvessels
extracted from naïve brains. There was also a slight increase in contralateral hemisphere after MCAO (over levels in naïve brain), but the
increase was not statistically signiﬁcant. Endothelial expression of CYP
epoxygenase prevented pro-inﬂammatory cytokine expression after
ischemia, as transgenic Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8 mice did not
show an increase in expression after MCAO.

following 5 min of reperfusion. B. No differences were observed in perfusion between female transgenic and WT mice during occlusion (n = 10 per group). After 5 min of reperfusion

respectively), while cells isolated from both Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2CYP2C8 transgenic lines release more 14,15-EET than WT cells
(18.44 ± 0.9 and 19.38 ± 0.6 compared to 12.96 ± 0.5 pg/million
cells respectively). No difference was observed in levels of 11,12-EET
itself following A23187 stimulation in endothelial cells derived from
either transgenic line (See Fig. 6).
We also investigated the effect of endothelial expression of these
two CYP isoforms on levels of fatty acid metabolites in cerebrospinal
ﬂuid (CSF) of male WT, Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2J2 mice using liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). We ﬁrst
measured levels of AA metabolites (Fig. 7A). Although CSF levels of EETs
were below detection, we were able to measure their stable
metabolites, DHETs. Levels of both 11,12- and 14,15-DHET were
signiﬁcantly increased in Tie2-CYP2C8 mice (0.21 ± 0.03 and 0.33 ±
0.05 pg/μl respectively) compared to WT (0.10 ± 0.02 and 0.18 ±
0.02 pg/μl respectively), while no increase was observed in mice
expressing CYP2J2. CYP2C8-, but not CYP2J2-expressing mice also
displayed increased levels of the LOX metabolite of AA, 12-HETE, while
levels of 5- and 15-HETE remained unchanged compared to WT. CSF
levels of COX metabolites of AA, 6-keto-prostaglandin (6-keto-PGF1α),
thromboxane B2 (TXB2), prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) and prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2), were not different from WT in either of the transgenic strains.
We also measured CYP products of linoleic acid and DHA metabolism
(Fig. 7B). Levels of the linoleic acid epoxides, 12,13- and 9,10-epoxyoctadecamonoenoic acid (EpOME), were below the level of detection.
We were able to quantify dihydroxy-octadecamonoenoic acid (12,13DiHOME); however no difference among genotypes was observed. The
epoxide product of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) metabolism by CYP,
19,20-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid (19,20-EpDPE), showed no difference
in CSF levels among genotypes; however, its metabolic product 19,20dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid (19,20-DiHDPA) was increased in
Tie2-CYP2C8 mice compared to WT control CSF (0.49 ± 0.06 to 1.33 ±
0.27 pg/μl respectively).
Fig. 5. Transgenic endothelial expression of CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 epoxygenase prevents
ischemia-induced cytokine expression after MCAO in male mice. Levels of TNFα (A) and
IL1-β (B) transcripts were assessed by qPCR in microvessels isolated from WT, Tie2CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8 brains, at 24 h after MCAO (both ipsilateral and contralateral
hemispheres) or from naïve mice (whole brain). In WT mice, a signiﬁcant increase in
both TNFα and IL1-β mRNA was observed in microvessels from the ipsilateral
hemisphere compared to naïve mice. No such increase was observed in microvessels
from either Tie2-CYP2J2 or Tie2-CYP2C8 transgenic mice. *p b 0.05 versus naïve (6–9
animals per group; vessels from 3 animals were combined in one pooled sample, and
2–3 independent pooled samples were analyzed in each group).

3.5. Increase in fatty acid metabolites in Tie2-CYP2C8 male mice
Since CYP 450 epoxygenases metabolize AA to form EETs, we investigated the effect of endothelial expression of these two CYP isoforms on
release of 11,12- and 14,15-EETs, also assessing their stable metabolites,
11–12- and 14,15-DHETs; these regioisomers were investigated since
these are the primary metabolic products synthesized by CYP2J2 and
CYP2C8 (Wu et al., 1996; Zeldin et al., 1995). Primary aortic endothelial
cells from WT, Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8 male mice were isolated
and cultured and the release of EETs and DHETs into the culture medium by these cells was measured, both in the quiescent state and also following stimulation with 10 μM A23187 calcium ionophore for 10 min
which acts to liberate arachidonic acid from the plasma membrane.
Our results show that, in the quiescent, unstimulated state, endothelial
cells isolated from Tie2-CYP2J2 mice release signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of 11,12-EET and DHET into the medium compared to cells
isolated from WT mice (14.05 ± 1.0 and 8.83 ± 0.8 pg/million cells
respectively for 11,12-EET and DHET combined). However, cells stimulated with A23187 show a different response, in this paradigm cells
isolated from Tie2-CYP2C8 mice release higher concentrations of
11,12-, and 14,15-EET and DHET combined compared to WT (27.14 ±
1.7 vs. 20.68 ± 2.0 and 65.76 ± 3.3 vs. 42.79 ± 5.4 pg/million cells

4. Discussion
The main ﬁndings of our study are: 1) transgenic expression of CYP
epoxygenase in vascular endothelium reduces infarct size after MCAO in
male and female mice, decreasing infarct in the hemisphere as a whole
in males but not females; 2) transgenic endothelial expression of
CYP2J2, but not CYP2C8 enhances blood ﬂow during MCAO in male,
but not female mice, and improvement in microvascular perfusion is
maintained during reperfusion; 3) in males transgenic endothelial
expression of either CYP2J2 or CYP2C8 attenuates post-ischemic expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in cerebral microvessels; 4) male
Tie2-CYP2J2 endothelial cells produce increased 11,12-EET in the
quiescent state; 5) upon liberation of AA from the plasma membrane
endothelial cells from both transgenic lines produce increased 14,15EET, while Tie2-CYP2C8 also produces increased levels of 11,12 EET
and DHET, and 6) male Tie2-CYP2C8 mice have higher CSF levels of
CYP metabolites of AA and DHA.
The biological activity of EETs is terminated through multiple pathways (Zeldin, 2001), including metabolism by soluble epoxide hydrolase
(sEH) into less active vicinal diols referred to as dihydroxyeicosatrienoic
acids (DHETs). We have previously demonstrated that mice with sEH
gene deletion (sEH knockout, sEHKO) have higher circulating 14,15-EET
and enhanced collateral perfusion in response to focal vascular occlusion,
resulting in reduced ischemic brain tissue damage (Zhang et al., 2008).
These ﬁndings suggested that increasing EETs bioavailability by decreasing their metabolism may protect against stroke. Indeed, pharmacological
inhibition of sEH was shown to reduce infarct size after MCAO in mice
and to attenuate neuronal cell death in culture induced by oxygen–
glucose deprivation (OGD) (Koerner et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007).
Since sEHKO mice have global deletion of sEH, resulting in increased
EETs in all cell types, we wondered about the speciﬁc contribution of
endothelial EETs to protection from cerebral ischemia. In the current

conditioned by Tie2-CYP2C8 cells. B. Upon stimulation of endothelial cells with A23187 calcium ionophore, cells isolated from both Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8 mice release
increased levels of 14,15-EET compared to WT cells. CYP2C8 endothelial cells also display increased DHET and EET + DHET levels of both 11,12- and 14,15-regioisomers in cellconditioned medium, compared to WT cells.

study we therefore examined the effect of transgenic overexpression of
two cytochrome P450 epoxygenase isoforms in vascular endothelium
under control of the Tie2 promoter (Schlaeger et al., 1997) on blood
ﬂow and infarct size after MCAO in male and female mice. We examined
males and females separately because of previous reports demonstrating
sex differences in P450 epoxygenase expression (Athirakul et al., 2008).
We focused on CYP2C8 and CYP2J2 isoforms because these two human
isoforms are highly expressed and major contributors to EETs biosynthesis in myocardial and vascular tissue (Enayetallah et al., 2004; Larsen
et al., 2006). However, their contribution to the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular disease has not been well characterized to date.
Our data suggest that male mice are protected from ischemic injury
by overexpression of CYP epoxygenase in vascular endothelium, regardless of whether the speciﬁc isoform is CYP2J2 or CYP2C8. The protection
by CYP2J2, but not CYP2C8 overexpression was associated with increased blood ﬂow during MCAO. Interestingly, Tie2-CYP2J2 mice also
had improved microvascular perfusion at 24 h after MCAO. Microvascular hypoperfusion at this point occurs as a result of multiple pathological
mechanisms, including vasoconstriction, microthrombosis, inﬂammation, and endothelial injury and swelling. Our observation that CYP2J2
protects against this injury suggests that EETs either protect endothelial
cells against the initial endothelial oxidative injury during ischemia–
reperfusion or blocks downstream inﬂammatory and pro-thrombotic
mechanisms.
Because infarct size was smaller in Tie2-CYP2C8, though unlike Tie2CYP2J2, collateral blood ﬂow was not increased, we searched for a non-

vascular mechanism of protection by endothelial expression of CYP2C8.
Since EETs possess anti-inﬂammatory properties in the vasculature
(Node et al., 1999), and ischemia-induced expression of inﬂammatory
cytokines in brain is attenuated in sEH knock-out mice (Koerner et al.,
2008), we tested the hypothesis that transgenic endothelial expression
CYP2C8 would attenuate MCAO-induced upregulation of cytokine
mRNA expression in cerebral microvessels. We found that endothelial
overexpression of either isoform prevented ischemia-induced cytokine
expression that is observed in WT microvessels after MCAO. Our observation supports recent studies demonstrating anti-inﬂammatory roles
for CYP2J2 both in cultured pulmonary endothelial cells and following
ischemia/reperfusion injury in the lung (Feng et al., 2013; Chen et al.,
2015), and CYP2C8 in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(Liu et al., 2014).
Following stimulation of aortic endothelial cells isolated from these
mice with a calcium ionophore to induce AA release from the plasma
membrane, a phenomenon which also occurs following ischemic insult,
we see an increase in the production of EETs and their DHET metabolites
by both CYP isoforms. It is interesting to note that despite Tie2-CYP2J2
demonstrating both increased blood ﬂow and decreased inﬂammatory
cytokines, endothelial cells from these mice produce increased 14,15EET following A23187 stimulation, but no increase in 11,12-EET. However the Tie2-CYP2C8 mice which were also protected from injury and
had a reduction in inﬂammatory cytokines with no increase in blood
ﬂow during occlusion, showed increases in both 11,12-EET metabolites
and 14,15-EET.

Fig. 7. Fatty acid metabolites in CSF from male WT, Tie2-CYP2J2 and Tie2-CYP2C8 mice. A. Metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) by CYP and LOX, but not COX enzymes were increased in
Tie2-CYP2C8, but not Tie2-CYP2J2 mice, compared to WT. B. 12,13-DiHOME, a product of linoleic acid metabolism by CYP and sEH, was not different among groups. The CYP product of
DHA metabolism, 19,20-EpDPE, was unaltered in CSF; however, its sEH metabolite 19,20-DiHDPA was increased in CSF from Tie2-CYP2C8 compared to WT mice. *p b 0.05 versus WT (n =
16 WT, 15 Tie2-CYP2J2, 11 Tie2-CYP2C8).

We also measured CSF levels of fatty acid metabolites in CSF collected from male mice. We found increased level of 11,12- and 14,15-DHET
in Tie2-CYP2C8, likely reﬂecting increased synthesis of 11,12- and
14,15-EET, the two main metabolites produced by CYP2C8 (Daikh
et al., 1994). Surprisingly we did not observe increased CSF DHETs in
Tie2-CYP2J2, although we did observe increased EET/DHET release by
endothelial cells from these mice. The lack of increased DHET in CSF
may reﬂect limited substrate (AA) availability, especially since these
were naïve mice and AA liberation from the plasma membrane occurs
following injury or other stimulation. We also observed increased
19,20-DiHDPA in CSF from Tie2-CYP2C8 mice, likely reﬂecting increased
formation of 19,20-EpDPE by CYP2C8 from DHA (Zhang et al., 2014), an
essential fatty acid and the most abundant Ω-3 fatty acid in neural tissues. A similar increase in plasma 19,20-EpDPE was also previously observed in Tie2-CYP2C8 (Shao et al., 2014). Finally, Tie2-CYP2C8 CSF also
had increased levels of 12-HETE; although 12/15-HETEs are primarily
produced via the lipoxygenase pathway, they have also been reported
to be produced by members of the 2C epoxygenase family, including
CYP2C8 (Rifkind et al., 1995; Bylund et al., 1998).
In contrast to males, transgenic expression of CYP2J2 or CYP2C8 in
endothelium did not alter CBF during MCAO in females and reduced infarct only in the striatum, though had no effect on the brain hemisphere
as a whole. This observation suggests that the P450 epoxygenase pathway plays a differential role in ischemic neuroprotection between males
than females. Consistent with this concept, dilations to endotheliumderived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in rat middle cerebral artery
(MCA) are less pronounced in females compared to males (Golding
and Kepler, 2001). In coronary, cerebral, renal, and skeletal muscle
circulations, EDHF has been suggested to be a cytochrome P450
epoxygenase metabolite (Alkayed et al., 1996; Fisslthaler et al., 1999;
Fulton et al., 1992; Huang et al., 2000; Davis et al., 2011). The absence
of protection in females by transgenic CYP expression in endothelium
suggests that females use a different mechanism for blood ﬂow regulation in the ischemic brain. One such mechanism could be endothelial nitric oxide (eNOS), which is enhanced by chronic estrogen treatment

(Athirakul et al., 2008; Goetz et al., 1994). For example, substance Pand shear stress-induced dilation of skeletal muscle arterioles was
greater in female than male rats, linked to greater release of NO in females (Huang and Kaley, 2004; Huang et al., 1997, 1998). However,
when eNOS is absent, as in the case of eNOS knockout mice, females
use the P450 epoxygenase pathway to mediate ﬂow-induced dilation
in skeletal muscle arterioles (Huang et al., 2000).
Alternatively, it is perhaps not surprising that transgenic expression
of the CYP isoforms did not protect female mice from ischemic damage.
Female WT mice sustain smaller infarcts than males following MCAO
while also maintaining higher CBF during occlusion. They also have
lower sEH levels in the brain and higher circulating EETs than males.
We have previously demonstrated that the sex difference in infarct
size is abolished in global sEH knock-out mice, where male infarct size
is reduced to that observed in females (Zhang et al., 2014). Overexpression of CYP enzymes in one cell type in the brain may therefore not afford additional beneﬁt to females who already beneﬁt from higher
levels of EETs. Whereas males, who have lower EETs, would beneﬁt
from increased generation of EETs by the endothelium. Although we
did not carry out a side-by-side comparison of expression levels of the
transgenes between males and females, we do demonstrate robust expression of both transgenes in the female brain by in situ hybridization.
Therefore the lack of protection from ischemic insult in female WT vs.
Tie2 mice does not appear to be due to a lack of expression of the
Tie2-driven CYP enzymes.
In summary, the current study examined the effects of transgenic
expression of cytochrome P450 epoxygenase in vascular endothelium
on focal cerebral ischemic injury in mice. We demonstrate that endothelial overexpression of two distinct human CYP isoforms is protective
in male mice. The mechanism of protection is dependent on which
CYP isoform is expressed, which is likely mediated by suppression
of ischemia-induced inﬂammation in Tie2-CYP2C8 mice, and a combination of anti-inﬂammatory mechanism with enhanced blood ﬂow
in Tie2-CYP2J2 mice. In contrast, transgenic expression of CYP
epoxygenase in females did not alter blood ﬂow or hemispheric infarct

size after MCAO. These ﬁndings suggest that the efﬁcacy and mechanism of protection of any therapeutic strategies targeting the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway may be inﬂuenced by sex and the
speciﬁc CYP isoform involved.
