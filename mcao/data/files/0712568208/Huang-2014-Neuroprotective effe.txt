Abstract: Rhynchophylline (Rhy) is an alkaloid isolated from Uncaria which has long
been recommended for the treatment of central nervous diseases. In our study, the
neuroprotective effect of Rhy was investigated in a stroke model, namely permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Rats were injected intraperitoneally once daily
for four consecutive days before surgery and then received one more injection after
surgery. The protein and mRNA levels of p-Akt, p-mTOR, apoptosis-related proteins
(p-BAD and cleaved caspase-3), TLR2/4/9, NF-κB, MyD88, BDNF and claudin-5 were
examined. Following pMCAO, Rhy treatment not only ameliorated neurological deficits,
infarct volume and brain edema, but also increased claudin-5 and BDNF expressions
(p < 0.05). Moreover, Rhy could activate PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling while inhibiting
TLRs/NF-κB pathway. Wortmannin, a selective PI3K inhibitor, could abolish the
neuroprotective effect of Rhy and reverse the increment in p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-BAD
levels. In conclusion, we hypothesize that Rhy protected against ischemic damage,
probably via regulating the Akt/mTOR pathway.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the USA. About 795,000 Americans suffer from stroke
annually [1]. Given the complex pathology, therapy for ischemic stroke remains a serious challenge.
The neurotoxic side effects greatly confine the application of tissue plasminogen activator, which is the
only approved drug on the market, for acute treatment of stoke [2]. New therapies that can target
multiple pathways are in greatly need.
Several pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to brain damage induced by cerebral ischemia,
such as inflammatory reactions, neuronal apoptosis, blood-brain barrier disruption, and so on [3].
Several reports have demonstrated that excessive inflammatory and immune responses were the
pathophysiological basis of damage in the ischemic brain area following cerebral infarction [4].
Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) and their downstream target Akt belong to a conserved family of
signal transduction enzymes, which plays an important part in regulating inflammatory responses and
apoptosis [5]. In the initial hours of cerebral ischemia, p-Akt protein level transiently rises in neurons,
and this increment is supposed to be a neuroprotective response [6]. p-Akt will activate the
downstream proteins such as Bcl-2-associated death protein (BAD), caspases and others. On the other
hand, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) also play an crucial role in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via
mediating the inflammatory responses [7]. TLRs can also capture ‘danger signals’ released from
necrotic cells and take part in initiating the inflammatory response and cell apoptotic process [8,9].
Moreover, PI3K/Akt signaling was involved in the protection against cerebral injury by
modulating TLR2 [10].
Uncaria rhynchophylla is a traditional Chinese herb that has long been used to treat neural
associated disorders in China [11]. Rhynchophylline (Rhy) is an alkaloid from Uncaria, and displays
impressive neuroprotective action [12–14]. Several studies have indicated that Rhy inhibits Ca2+ influx
and protects cerebellar granule cells from glutamate toxicity [15]. Via regulation of the TLR and
neurotrophin signaling pathways, Rhy exhibited anti-convulsive effects in rats with acute seizures. Rhy
could reduce the apoptosis induced by dopamine treatment in human teratocarcinoma cell line [16] and
effectively block proinflammatory cytokines release in LPS-activated microglial cells [17]. Whether
Rhy could exhibit neuroprotection in permanent focal cerebral ischemia (pMCAO) remains unknown.
In this study, we first investigated whether Rhy could attenuate ischemic brain damage and then
explored the role of PI3K/Akt and TLRs/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways underlying
Rhy’s effect in cerebral ischemia.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Effect of Rhy on Cerebral Infarction, Neurological Deficit, and Brain Edema
We examined the effect of Rhy at two doses, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, on ischemic brain damage
after pMCAO surgery. In the pMCAO group, we noticed a large brain infarction that encompassed the
majority of the cortex in the brain hemisphere. The volume of the ischemic brain was considerably
reduced in Rhy-H group compared to the control group (41.4% ± 3.7% and 28.5% ± 5.9%, p < 0.05)
(Figure 1A).

(MW) and Rhy-H + wortmannin (RW) groups (* p < 0.05 Rhy and Sham vs. pMCAO,
#
p < 0.05 RW vs. RH).

Neurological deficit was examined by a 6-point scale after ischemic stroke (Figure 1B). Relevant
neurological deficit appeared in pMCAO group, such as less spontaneous activity and irregular
posture. These indicators were remarkably relieved in Rhy-H group but not in Rhy-L group.
Sham-operated rats did not show any neurological deficit. Ischemic brain edema was confirmed by
assessing the cerebral water content of ischemic brain tissue. The cerebral water content was greatly
relieved by Rhy-H treatment, not by Rhy-L treatment (Rhy-H vs. pMCAO: 83.2% ± 1.1% vs.
85.6% ± 1.0%, p < 0.05). Wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, abolished the protective effect of
Rhy (Figure 1C).
2.2. Effects of Rhy on p-Akt, p-mTOR, p-BAD and Caspase-3 Expressions
Western blotting analysis was used to estimate the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling and the
downstream apoptosis-related proteins (Figure 2A). In line with previous studies [18], up-regulated
p-Akt and p-mTOR was observed in the pMCAO group compared to the Sham group. Compared to the
pMCAO group and Sham groups, treatment with both high and low doses of Rhy considerably
(p < 0.05) increased the ratio of p-Akt/Akt and p-mTOR/mTOR. Cerebral ischemia decreased p-BAD
expression and increased cleaved caspase 3 expression as compared to the Sham group. Rhy-H
preconditioning greatly (p < 0.05) prevented the p-BAD decrement and caspase-3 increment induced
by the pMCAO. Wortmannin remarkably (p < 0.05) eliminated p-Akt, p-mTOR and p-BAD elevation
induced by Rhy.
The immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the results obtained from western blotting. The
immunopositive signals of cleaved caspase-3 in the infarct area were significantly elevated than the
Sham group, whereas p-BAD expression was reduced (Figure 2C). Compared to the pMCAO group,
Rhy treatment not only reduced the number of cells positive of cleaved caspse-3 but also increased that
of p-BAD (p < 0.05). Treatment of wortmannin partially abolished the protective effects of Rhy-H.

2.3. Effect of Rhy on the Activation of TLRs/NF-κB Signaling
We analyzed the protein level of total TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, nuclear NF-κB and MyD88 with
Western blot. In Sham group, the NF-κB was abundant in cytosolic fractions but scarce in nuclear
extracts. While in pMCAO group, NF-κB level was expressively enlarged in nuclear fraction and poor
in cytosolic fractions at 24 h after ischemia, signifying the translocation from the cytosol to the
nucleus. TLR2, TLR4, TLR9 and MyD88 expressions were up-regulated 24 h post-pMCAO. Only
high dose of Rhy was able to inhibit the expression of TLR2/4, MyD88 and NF-κB p65 translocation
(p < 0.05, Figure 3A).

The localization of MyD88 and NF-κB was further determined by immunohistochemistry after
stroke. Few cells positive of MyD88 and NF-κB were observed in the Sham group. Cerebral ischemia
increased the cells positive of MyD88 and NF-κB than the Sham group. Consistent with western

Molecules 2014, 19

11202

blotting results, high dose Rhy treatment considerably reduced expression of MyD88 and NF-κB
(p < 0.05). Still, there were no significant differences between pMCAO and Rhy-L group (Figure 3C).
2.4. Effect of Rhy on the Expression of Claudin-5 and BDNF
We further investigated the levels of the tight junction protein claudin-5 and brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which could alleviate damage following ischemia [19,20]. In pMCAO
group, claudin-5 was significantly declined than in the Sham group. Only Rhy-H could reverse
claudin-5 decrease at both protein and mRNA levels (p < 0.05, Figure 4). The mean ratios of the
BDNF densitometry data to those of β-actin in the Sham, pMCAO and Rhy-H groups were 0.55 ± 0.12,
0.31 ± 0.10, and 1.0 ± 0.14, respectively. The data above indicated the expression of BDNF was
decreased after pMCAO surgery, while significantly upregulated after Rhy treatment. Similar results
were obtained from RT-qPCR analysis (Figure 4C).

(*p < 0.05 vs. pMCAO).

2.5. Discussion
pMCAO is a successful model to study cerebral ischemic damage in rats [21]. The cytotoxic
responses, such as apoptosis, oxidative stress, proinflammation and neurological damage will initiate
immediately upon the onset of cerebral ischemia. Anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis therapies have
attracted significant interest to combat ischemia-induced damage. Inhibiting inflammatory mediators
displayed neuroprotection against ischemic brain damage [22]. Recent evidence suggests that TLRs
may be the important targets for developing new treatment approaches for cerebral ischemia
injury [23,24]. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that TLR4 and TLR9 contribute to the
inflammatory reaction [8,25]. Moreover, the expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 were enhanced after an
ischemic stroke. Compared with wild-type mice, the neurological deficit and cerebral infarction
induced by cerebral ischemia were remarkably attenuated in TLR2 or TLR4 knockout mice [26,27].
NF-κB, a key nuclear transcription factor, could combine with specific DNA sequence to trigger
inflammation response and ischemic neuronal apoptosis [28]. TLRs were reported to induce
NF-κB-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines through a MyD88-dependent pathway [29,30]. Cerebral
ischemic injury activates TLR4-mediated signal transduction pathway and promote NF-κB
translocation from the cytoplasm into nucleus. In our study, we observed the increment of TLR2,
TLR4, nuclear NF-κB and MyD88 expressions at 24 h after ischemia, and high dose of Rhy
considerably blunted the expression of these factors and inhibited p65 NF-κB transduction in ischemic
brain. As an inflammatory mediator, TLR9 also involves in the process of ischemic damage [31], but Rhy
fails to influence the expression of TLR9 in our study.
On the other hand, the PI3K/Akt pathway also renders neuroprotection after ischemic stroke [18].
Akt/mTOR signaling involves in cardiovascular disease and ischemic cardiomyocyte
apoptosis [32,33]. In addition, Akt/mTOR signaling might relate to the protection against apoptosis in
Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. Western blotting analysis revealed enhanced expression of
p-mTOR in ischemia area in our study. The PI3K/Akt pathway promotes neovascularization and
results in a noteworthy reduction in infarct size after ischemia [34]. However, there are inconsistent
results about the level of phospho-Akt after ischemic injury. Osuka revealed that dysfunction of the
Akt pathway was involved in ischemic damage [35], but Noshita and Shibata insisted that, within
hours, pAkt transiently increase in neurons following cerebral ischemia [36,37], and this raise is
regarded as a neuroprotective action. In Gao’s and Ishrat’s research, up-regulated pAkt was observed
compared to sham group 24 h post-pMCAO [38,39]. Consistently, the same result was obtained in
our manuscript.
Several reasons might contribute to the discrepancy in pAkt level. Firstly, p-Akt level depended on
the timing after the injury/stress. After ischemia, pAkt was dephosphorylated immediately in the CA1
region and rephosphorylated after only 5 min of ischemia [40]. Secondly, the extent of ischemic injury
also accounts-lethal damage downregulated pAkt in the CA1 region, but sublethal damage increased
pAkt. Thirdly, the origin of tissue used in protein analysis also works. pAkt level was elevated in
cortex in our manuscript or in peri-infarct cortical tissue in Ishrat’s research [39], or in the ipsilateral
cerebral cortex as described by Pérez-Álvarez [41]. Both Gao and Shibata revealed that the enhanced
pAkt occurred mainly in neurons located in the outer area of the middle cerebral artery territory

Molecules 2014, 19

11204

(ischemic penumbra) [37,38], but Osuka reported that PI3K/Akt signaling was down-regulated in
bilateral cortices adjacent to the hippocampus [35].
Cerebral ischemia motivates Akt and mTOR, which subsequently prevents BAD into the
mitochondrial membrane, finally inhibiting death of neurons. Although BAD translocation into the
mitochondrial membrane was inhibited by pAkt, phosphorylation of BAD was increased by activated
Akt, thereby inhibiting the apoptotic activity and promoting cell survival [42]. As we know, p-BAD
increment contributes to the inhibition of apoptosis. Apoptotic stimuli result in dephosphorylation of
BAD, thus activating caspase-3 and Bax [43].
Our data show that Rhy reduced ischemic brain damage, probably by increasing the ratio of
p-mTOR/mTOR, and triggering its downstream target p-BAD, thereby reducing ischemic neuronal
death. These data resemble those reported by Ishrat that neuroprotective agents protect against stroke
via mediating Akt/BAD phosphorylation [39,42]. Why there isn’t a direct and proportional relationship
between pBAD and pAkt expression? It is reasonable that there is not enough pAkt to trigger pBAD at
24 h post-injury. Because the damage in the cortex region inflicted by the stroke model is relatively
moderate. Herein, it is possible that Rhy treatment up-regulated pAkt in pMCAO rats and thereby
increasing pBAD. Furthermore, in our study, wortmannin weakened the activation of BAD & Akt and
thus abolished Rhy’s effects, confirming the critical role of PI3K/Akt pathway.
BDNF, which is widely distributed in central nervous system, protects tissue from injury and fosters
neuronal plasticity via the PI3K/Akt pathway [18]. Akt pathway is an important downstream signaling
pathway of BDNF. By interfering with apoptotic pathways, BDNF was able to protest cerebral
ischemic injury [44,45]. In line with previous studies [46], pMCAO surgery resulted in a considerable
shrink in BDNF level, which was then reversed by Rhy treatment. Consistently, Zhang and his co-workers
demonstrated that the Akt/BDNF pathway could be activated to relieve ischemic injury [47].
3. Experimental Section
3.1. Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g), from the SLAC Lab Animal Center of Shanghai
(Shanghai, China), were maintained on a standard diet and water ad libitum (light/dark cycle with
humidity of 60% ± 5%, 22 ± 3 °C). The experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics
Committee of Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Chinese Medicine.
3.2. Surgery
As previously described, the pMCAO model was used to make permanent focal ischemia [48,49].
The left side of common carotid artery was isolated. Inserting a nylon mono-filament into the internal
carotid artery about 18–20 mm until 80%–90% reduction of cerebral blood flow was observed by a
blood flow monitor (Periflux system 5000, Perimed, Milan, Italy). Rectal temperature was kept at
36 °C to 38 °C in the surgery. The same surgical procedure was carried out in Sham group without
inserting a filament.

3.3. Experimental Design
Rhy (Zeji Medical Technology Co., Shanghai, China) with purity > 98% was dissolved in sterile
physiological saline and intraperitoneally administrated once daily for four consecutive days before
surgery and then received one more injection after surgery. Rats were randomly divided into 4 groups
(20 rats in each group). Sham group; pMCAO group: pMCAO controls that received 0.9% saline;
Rhy-L group: low-dose Rhy of 10 mg/kg; and Rhy-H group: high-dose Rhy of 30 mg/kg. Wortmannin
(30 μg/kg) was given intravenously at 30 min post-pMCAO to explore the role of PI3K/Akt signaling
in Rhy’s neuroprotective effects.
3.4. Neurobehavioral Evaluation
At 24 h after pMCAO surgery, the neurologic behaviors were evaluated as previously described [50]:
(1) spontaneous activity; (2) symmetry in the movement of four limbs; (3) forepaw outstretching; (4)
climbing; (5) body proprioception; (6) response to vibrissae touch. The score was the summation of all
six individual test scores, from 3 to 18.
3.5. Infarct Volumes
After rats were sacrificed, the brains were removed quickly and coronally cut into 3-mm sections,
and stained with 1% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37 °C for 15 min. The
infarcted brain seemes white, while the noninfarcted region closes to pink. The sections were
photographed and measured with Image Pro-Plus 5.1 software. To eliminate the effect of brain edema,
correction for edema of infarct area was achieved as previously described [51].
3.6. Brain Edema
Rats were killed 24 h after cerebral ischemia, and brain samples were obtained [52]. The ischemic
area was carefully blotted with filter paper and weighed to get the wet weights (WW). Dry the
ischemic hemispheres at 100 °C for 24 h, thus obtaining a constant weight as the dry weight (DW).
Water content was calculated based on the formulation: H2O (%) = (WW − DW)/WW × 100%.
3.7. Western Blot Analysis
The cortex tissues were lysed in lysis buffer, and the mixed liquor was centrifuged at 14,000 g for
5 min at the temperature of 4 °C. Nuclear protein extraction was carried out with the extraction kit
(Keygen Biotech. Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). Brain homogenate aliquots containing 50 μg protein
were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore
Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) and probed with antibodies included BAD, p-BAD, mTOR, p-mTOR,
cleaved caspase 3, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 (diluted 1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz,
CA, USA), Akt, p-Akt and Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (1:1,000, Epitomics,
Burlingame, CA, USA), NF-κB, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and claudin-5 (1:1,000,
Proteintech, Chicago, IL, USA) and β-actin (1:4,000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA). Protein bands
were quantified and normalized to β-actin using Image J software.

3.8. Immunohistochemical Rtudies
Sections (5 μm) from paraformaldehyde-fixed cortex tissues were dewaxed with xylene and graded
ethanol series (100%, 95%, and 70%, v/v, 2 min each) and then washed in distilled water. The sections
were incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide to quench the activity of endogenous peroxidase.
Sequentially, the slides were placed in citrate buffer and heated at 100 °C to retrieve antigens. The
slides were incubated with MyD88 and NF-κB mouse polyclonal antibody (1:1,000, Proteintech),
p-BAD and cleaved caspase-3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:500, Santa Cruz) for 1 h, followed by
incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Sections were then washed
with distilled water, incubated with diaminobenzidine-hydrogen peroxide, and counterstained with
hematoxylin. Immunoreactivity was identified as brown nuclear counterstained with hematoxylin.
3.9. Real-Time Reverse Ranscription-Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
Total RNA from ischemia cortex was isolated from the brain after pMCAO using TRIzol Reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Integrity of total RNA was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
BDNF: F: GGCTTGACATCATTGGCTGAC, R: CATTGGGCCGAACTTTCTGGT; Claudin-5: F:
CTCTGCTGGTTCGCCAACAT, R: CAGCTCGTACTTCTGCGACA; GAPDH: F: AAGGTCGGT
GTGAACGGATTT. R: AGATGATGACCCTTTTGGCCC. RT-PCR analysis was performed as
follows: DNA was denatured at 94 °C for 3 min and cycled immediately for 35 cycles: denaturing at
94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 56 °C for 55 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The products were run on
an agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide and then photographed.
3.10. Statistics
The data are presented as the mean ± SE. The data from multiple groups were analyzed with
one-way ANOVA and the Newman Keuls test for post hoc comparisons. Other data of the two groups
were analysed using Student’s t-test. p values < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant.
4. Conclusions
Our work suggests that the neuroprotective effects of Rhy are, at least partially, mediated via the
activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. In this experiment, we concentrated on the acute-stage treatment
for ischemic damage. Further studies are warranted to investigate Rhy’s long-term effects.
