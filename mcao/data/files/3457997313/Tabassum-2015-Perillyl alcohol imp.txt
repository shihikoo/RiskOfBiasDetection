Perillyl alcohol (PA) is a monoterpene found in essential oils of mints, cherries, citreous fruits and lemon
grass, reported to have antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory properties. However, the role of PA in stroke is
still illusive. Since oxidative stress and inﬂammation play a pivotal role in ischemia–reperfusion (I–R)
injury, this study was designed to elucidate the potential effects of PA against I–R induced pathology in
rat's brain. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h followed by 22 h reperfusion in Wistar male
rats (250–280 g, 14–16 weeks old) induced the behavioral and histological alterations along with
exhausted antioxidant status and enhanced inﬂammatory mediators. However, PA administration (25,
50 and 100 mg/kg b.wt orally once daily for 7 days) prior to MCAO signiﬁcantly attenuated neurological
deﬁcits related to ﬂexion test and spontaneous motor activity, improved grip strength and motor
coordination in a dose dependent manner. PA treatment also inhibited oxidative stress in MCAO rats as
evident from decreased lipid peroxidation and augmented level of reduced glutathione and restored
activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase and thus, reduced infarct volume
and protected the brain histology after I–R injury. Furthermore, PA markedly suppressed the level of
proinﬂammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF α and IL-6) and down regulated expressions of cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS-2) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in MCAO group. In
conclusion, PA mediates neuroprotection against I–R injury via mitigation of oxidative stress and
inﬂammation and thus, may be a good therapeutic approach in stroke prone patient.

stress, apoptosis and inﬂammation that lead to neuronal injury
(Lakhan et al., 2009; Woodruff et al., 2011). Oxidative stress is
considered as an early and foremost pathological factor of I–R
injury responsible for endogenous antioxidant depletion leading
to worsened functional outcomes (Allen and Bayraktutan, 2009;
Loh et al., 2010). Moreover, inﬂammation is an integral mediator of
stroke pathology particularly in context of reperfusion. In addition,
reactive oxygen species also causes breakdown of blood brain
barrier (BBB) that leads to accumulation of neutrophils in the
brain, transmigration of adhesive molecules, activation of microglia, monocytes and macrophages in ischemic region (Wang et al.,
2007; Vaibhav et al., 2012). Eventually, it mediates the release
of cytotoxic mediators like proinﬂammatory cytokines (IL-1β,
IL-6 and TNF α), inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS-2),

cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and reactive
oxygen species which further potentiate the brain tissue damage
(Amor et al., 2010; Maddahi and Edvinsson, 2010). Therefore,
attenuation of oxidative stress and inﬂammatory mediators are
regarded as hopeful pharmacological interventions against I–R
injury.
Now-a-days several plant derived compounds having antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory properties are getting more popularity in treating neurodegenerative diseases that effectively
alleviated the oxidative stress and neuronal damage leading to
improve behavioral function (Ma et al., 2013; Tabassum et al.,
2013; Vaibhav et al., 2013b). Perillyl alcohol (PA) is a plant origin
monoterpene found in essential oil of several plant species
like mints, cherries, citreous fruits, lemon grass etc (Crowell,
1999). Recently, PA has exhibited various pharmacological properties attributed to its antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory potential
(Jahangir and Sultana, 2007; Khan et al., 2011). It has also
been reported that PA has anti- dementia effects associated
with modulation of dopaminergic neurons and mitigation of
acetyl cholinesterase activity in scopolamine treated rats (Zhou
et al., 2009). Previously PA has exhibited the inhibitory role on
Ca2 þ dependent constitutive nuclear factor–KB pathway since
PA treatment mediates a remarkable reduction of the L type
calcium channels (Berchtold et al., 2005). Hence might be proposed as neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia (Cross et al.,
2010). To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports available
regarding protective effect of PA against I–R injury. Therefore,
keeping consideration of these facts, the present study was
proposed to elucidate the effective role of PA in MCAO model
of rats

2. Materials and methods

eBioscience, USA.

2.2. Animals
Male Wistar rats (250–280 g; 14–16 week old) were provided
from Central Animal House facility of Jamia Hamdard (Hamdard
University), New Delhi. The rats were kept in a group of four
animals per cage at a temperature 23 72 1C and relative humidity
45–50% with 12 h light dark cycles and had free access to standard
rodent pellet diet and puriﬁed ﬁltered tap water. The food was
withdrawn 12 h before the surgery. Experiments were carried out
as the international procedure approved by Government of India,
New Delhi, India [Registration no 173/CPCSEA/2000; IAEC project♯
666]. All pains were made to lessen animal distress and to reduce
the number of animals used in this study.

2.3. Experimental design
2.3.1. Experimental design
Rats were randomly divided into six groups. The ﬁrst group
sham (S) was treated orally with corn oil (n ¼16, 8 for behavior,
oxidative stress and cytokines estimation; 2 for TTC; 6 for histopathology and immunohistochemistry); the second MCAO group
was treated orally with vehicle and subjected to 2 h MCAO
followed by 22 h reperfusion (n ¼22, 8 for behavior and TTC;
8 for oxidative stress and cytokines estimation; 6 for histopathology and immunohistochemistry); third group (P25 þMCAO), was
treated orally with 25 mg/kg b.wt of PA once daily for 7 days
followed by 2 h MCAO and 22 h reperfusion (n ¼8, behavior
and TTC); fourth group (P50 þ MCAO), was treated orally with
50 mg/kg b.wt of PA once daily for 7 days followed by 2 h MCAO
and 22 h reperfusion (n¼ 22, 8 for behavior and TTC; 8 for
oxidative stress and cytokines estimation; 6 for histopathology
and immunohistochemistry); ﬁfth group (P100 þMCAO), was
treated orally with 100 mg/kg b.wt of PA once daily for 7 days
followed by 2 h MCAO and 22 h reperfusion (n¼ 22, 8 for behavior
and TTC; 8 for oxidative stress and cytokines estimation; 6 for
histopathology and immunohistochemistry); and the last group
(P100 þS), was sham operated treated with 100 mg/kg b.wt of PA
for 7 days (n ¼8 for behavior and oxidative stress enzymes).
2.4. Induction of ischemia
Rats were subjected to right MCAO on 8th day using an
intraluminal technique by Longa et al. (1989) as described by
Tabassum et al. (2013). Rats were anaesthetized with chloral
hydrate (400 mg/kg b.wt, i.p). The silicon coated suture
(4-030333 REPK10) was inserted into external carotid artery
(ECA) through internal carotid artery (ICA) [17-20 mm] until a
slight résistance was felt, that blocks the opening of middle
cerebral artery (MCA) and blood ﬂow from ICA, anterior carotid
artery (ACA), and posterior carotid artery (PCA). The suture was
withdrawn very carefully after 2 h of occlusion, the wound was
sutured and rat was placed in their normal environment with free
access of food and water for 22 h. Sham group underwent sham
surgery except MCAO.
2.5. Behavioral assessment
All the animals were given training on behavioral tests for
a minimum four days before MCAO to make known to behavioral
tests. The behavioral assessment was done after 22 h of reperfusion between 9:00a.m. and 4:00 p.m. at standard laboratory
conditions (temperature 25 72 1C and relative humidity (4550%) by a person blind to experimental condition.
2.5.1. Neurological severity assessment
After 22 h of reperfusion, the neurological status of the animals
was evaluated using two different methods: Flexion test (FT) and
spontaneous motor activity (SMA). FT was used as previously
described by Vaibhav et al. (2013a) based on four scoring system of
neurological severity outcomes was scored, 0: no observed neurological deﬁcit; 1: contralateral forelimb ﬂexion with wrist ﬂexion
and shoulder adduction; 2: reduced resistance to lateral push; and
3: circling towards the paretic side. SMA was also evaluated for
5 min by placing the animals in their normal environment (cage)
as performed by Yousuf et al. (2007). Neurological scoring was
given as, 0: rats moved around in the cage and explored the
environment; 1: rats moved in the cage but did not approach to all
the sides and hesitated to move; 2: rats barely moved in the cage
and showed postural abnormalities (curved towards the paretic

192

side); and 3: rats unable to move at all with their posture curved
towards the paretic side
2.5.2. Grip strength assessment
Grip test was performed by the method of Ali et al. (2004) as
described by Tabassum et al. (2013). The equipment consists of
two supports pulled by tight string of 50 cm length and elevated
40 cm from a ﬂat surface. The rat was placed on the string at a
point midway between supports and evaluated according to the
following scale, 0: fall off; 1: hangs onto string by two forepaws; 2:
as for 1 but attempts to climb on string; 3: hangs onto string by
two forepaws plus one or both hind paws; 4: hangs onto string by
all fore paws plus tail wrapped around string, 5: escape.
2.5.3. Rota rod (motor co-ordination)
Muscular coordination was done after 22 h of reperfusion using
Omni Rotor (Omnitech Electronics, Inc., Columbus, OH, USA) as
reported by Vaibhav et al. (2013a). It comprised of a rotating rod,
75 mm diameter, which was divided into four compartments to
permit the testing of four rats at a time. The apparatus automatically recorded the time in 0.1 s, when the rat falls off the
rotating shaft. The speed was set at 10 cycles per minute and cut of
time was 180 s. The rats were trained for maximum response four
days prior to surgery for 5 times at 1 h interval per day.
2.6. Assessments of ischemic injury
2.6.1. Infarct volume assessment
The animals were killed after 22 h of reperfusion and brains
were dissected out carefully. The brain was cut into ﬁve coronal
sections of 3 mm in thickness by sharp blades in brain box
(Activational Systems, MI, and USA) and stained with 0.1% TTC
for 30 min at 37 1C (Tabassum et al., 2013). After incubation, the
color images were taken. Infarct area, ipsilateral and contralateral
areas of each section of the brain were measured by software
Image J 1.37v, NIH, USA. Infarct volume was expressed as percentage of total contralateral hemispheric volume (Vaibhav et al.,
2013a, 2013b). Cerebral edema was also calculated using the
following formula: (ipsilateral volume – contralateral volume) 
100/contralateral volume (%) (Egashira et al., 2013). The calculation
and presentation of infarct size were compensated for hemispheric
edema index (Chen et al., 2012). Infarcts measurements were
carried out by an investigator unaware to the treatment groups.
2.6.2. Histopathology of the brain
The rats were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg
body wt) after 22 h reperfusion and perfused transcardially
through ascending aorta with 100 ml ice cold phosphate buffer
saline (PBS) 10 mM, pH 7.4 followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate buffer (PB 10 mM, pH 7.4). Brains were isolated rapidly
with care and post ﬁxed in paraformaldehyde for 48 h. The coronal
sections with penumbral cortex (Cx) and CA1 region of hippocampus (Hs) were embedded in parafﬁn, processed and 5 mm thick
sections on glass slides were stained with haematoxylin and eosin
(H & E) (Vaibhav et al., 2012). The images were taken with the help
of microscope (Olympus BX50, Japan).
2.6.2.1. Counting of neuronal loss. Histological alterations (pyknotic
nuclei) have been indicated by white arrow and normal neurons
by black arraw in the representative photographs. Neuronal loss
was explored as described by Vaibhav et al. (2012). Darkly stained
punctate nuclei have been described as pyknotic nuclei and
fragmented nuclei and counted as single nucleus. The cells with
pyknotic nuclei were regarded as dead cells and not counted in the
counting of viable cell. Total number of viable cells and dead cells

(pyknotic nuclei) were counted in 5 distinct areas of ipsilateral Hs
(CA1)/Cx under the microscopic ﬁeld (magniﬁcation  400) in
each group. The neuronal loss has been expressed as percentage of
dead cells in terms of total viable cells in ipsilateral Hs (CA1)/Cx
ﬁeld in each group. The counting of cells in each ﬁeld was
ﬁve times.
2.7. Biochemical estimation
After 22 h of reperfusion, rats were killed and brains were
isolated to dissect ipsilateral hippocampus and frontal cortex.
Tissue was homogenized in PB of 10 mM and pH 7.4 to give 5%
homogenate and centrifuge at 825g at 4 1C for 5 min to separate
debris. The supernatant-1 (S-1) was used for assessment of lipid
peroxidation (LPO). Rest of the S-1 was further centrifuged at
10,500g for 15 min at 4 1C to get post mitochondrial supernatant
(PMS) which was used for the assessment of reduced glutathione
(GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR),
and catalase (CAT).
2.7.1. Lipid peroxidation (LPO)
LPO was assessed by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive
species (TBARS) as described by Islam et al. (2002). Brieﬂy 0.25 ml
of S-1 was incubated in metabolic water bath shaker at 37 1C;
another same homogenate (0.25 ml) was incubated at 0 1C. After
1 h of incubation, 0.25 ml TCA and 0.5 ml TBA (0.67%) were added.
The mixture was centrifuge at 3000  g for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred into fresh test tube and boiling water bath
for 10 min. Thereafter, test-tube was allowed to cool and the
absorbance was taken at 535 nm. The rate of LPO was expressed
as nmol of TBARS formed/h/mg protein using molar extinction
coefﬁcient of 1.56  105 M  1 cm  1.
2.7.2. Reduced glutathione (GSH)
GSH was determined by the method of Jollow et al. (1974). The
PMS was precipitated with 4% salphosalicylic acid in 1:1 (v/v) and
incubated for 1 h at 4 1C and centrifuged at 1200g for 15 min at
4 1C to obtain supernatant. The assay mixture consisted of 0.1 ml
of supernatant, 0.1 ml of DTNB and PB (0.1 M, pH 7.4) in a total
volume of 1 ml. The yellow color developed was read immediately
at 412 nm. The GSH level was calculated as μmol GSH/mg protein
using molar extinction coefﬁcient 13.6  103 M  1 cm  1.
2.7.3. Catalase (CAT)
CAT activity was estimated by the method of Claiborne (1985).
Brieﬂy, the assay mixture consisted of 0.05 M PB (pH 7.0), 0.019 M
H2O2, and 0.05 ml PMS in a total volume of 1.0 ml. Changes in
absorbance were recorded at 240 nm. Catalase activity was calculated in terms of nmol H2O2 consumed/min/mg protein using
molar extinction coefﬁcient of 43.6  103 M  1 cm  1.
2.7.4. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx)
GPx activity was assessed according to the method described
by Mohandas et al. (1984). The reaction mixture consisted of PB
(0.05 M, pH 7.0), EDTA (1 mM), sodium azide (1 mM), glutathione
reductase (1 EU/ml), glutathione (1 mM), NADPH (0.2 mM), hydrogen peroxide (0.25 mM) and 0.1 ml of PMS in the ﬁnal volume of
1 ml. The disappearance of NADPH at 340 nm was recorded at
room temperature. The enzyme activity was calculated as nmol
NADPH oxidized/min/mg protein by using molar extinction coefﬁcient of 6.22  103 M  1 cm  1.
2.7.5. Glutathione reductase (GR)
GR activity was assayed by the method of Carlberg and
Mannerviek (1975) as modiﬁed by Mohandas et al. (1984).

R. Tabassum et al. / European Journal of Pharmacology 747 (2015) 190–199

The assay mixture consisted of PB (0.1 M, pH 7.6), NADPH (0.1 mM),
EDTA (0.5 mM), oxidized glutathione (1 mM) and 0.1 ml of PMS in
total volume of 1 ml. The enzyme activity was assayed at room
temperature by measuring the disappearance of NADPH at 340 nm
and calculated as nmol NADPH oxidized/min/mg protein using molar
extinction coefﬁcient of 6.22  103 M  1 cm  1.

2.8. Estimation of Cytokines
The TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were assayed in the PMS using assays
kits (eBioscience, USA) according to the manufacturer's guideline.
The concentration of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 was expressed as
ng/mg protein.

2.9. Immunohistochemistry of COX-2, NOS-2 and NF-κB
After 22 h of reperfusion, rats were anesthetized with chloral
hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused transcardially with PBS
(0.1M, pH 7.4) at 4 1C followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M
PBS (pH 7.4). The brain was removed quickly, and post ﬁxed in
paraformaldehyde till sectioning. The tissues were embedded in
parafﬁn and cut into coronal sections of 5 μm in thickness and
collected serially on poly-L-lysine coated slides. Coronal sections were
dewaxed and processed for immunohistological staining. Tissue
sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 in methanol to remove endogenous peroxidase activity at room temperature. After washing with
PBS, the sections were pre-incubated in 2% bovine serum albumin for
45 min. Thereafter slides were incubated with primary antibodies
rabbit polyclonal anti-COX-2 (dilution, 1:200) primary antibodies
mice polyclonal, anti-NOS-2 (dilution, 1:300) and mouse monoclonal
anti-NF-κB (dilution, 1:300) for overnight at 4 1C. The slides were
washed with PBS to remove the unbound antibodies and sections
were incubated with horse reddish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG (1:500) or anti-mouse IgG (1:500) secondary antibodies respectively for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were
treated with 3, 4 -diaminobenzidene and observed under microscope
(Olympus, BX 50, Japan)

2.9.1. Quantiﬁcation of positive cells
The positively stained cells for COX-2, NOS-2 and NF-κB were
counted in 5 randomized areas of cortex and repeated ﬁve times in
each group to quantify the expression of proteins (magniﬁcation: 
400 for COX-2, NOS-2 and NF-κB) with the help of the microscope
(Olympus, BX50, Japan). The results were expressed as the percentage of positively stained cells of total cell counted in each group
(Vaibhav et al., 2013b).

2.10. Protein estimation
Protein was assessed by the method of Lowry et al. (1951) using
bovine serum albumin as standard.

2.11. Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as mean 7S.E.M except for the
repeated assessment of neurological score (FT, SMA and grip
strength score). Statistical analysis of the data was done by one
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's test with
the help of Origin 7. FT, SMA and grip strength score were analyzed
by a Mann Whitney U test with median (Graph Pad Prism 5.01).
The P value o0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. PA reduces the behavioral deﬁcits
A signiﬁcant neurological severity in FT (A) and SMA (B) was
seen in MCAO group as compared to sham group (Po 0.01). PA
treatment decreased the severity of FT and SMA in P50 þMCAO
(P o0.05) and P100 þMCAO (P o0.01) groups signiﬁcantly as
compared to MCAO group (Fig. 1A and B). A signiﬁcant weak grip
strength (C) and poor motor coordination (D) were observed in
MCAO group as compared to sham group (Po0.001). PA treated
groups [P50 þMCAO (Po 0.05) and P100 þMCAO (Po0.01)] have
also shown signiﬁcant improvement in grip strength and motor
coordination as compared to MCAO group, whereas P25 þMCAO
group did not recover signiﬁcantly (Fig.1C and D). There was no
signiﬁcant alteration in P100 þS as compared to sham group.
3.2. PA reduced the infarct volume
TTC stained coronal sections of MCAO brain have shown larger
infarct volume (unstained or white color) and edema as compared
to sham group (P o0.01). PA treated MCAO groups, [P25 þMCAO
(P o0.05); P50 þMCAO (P o0.01) and P100 þMCAO (Po 0.01)]
have shown a signiﬁcant decrement in infarct volume and edema
as compared to MCAO group (Fig. 2A–C).
On the bases of neurological and behavioral test and TTC
staining, two best doses 50 mg/ b.wt (P50) and 100 mg/kg b.wt
(P100) were selected for further study.
3.3. Effect of PA on histological alterations
Histological study of sham group showed the normal pyramidal
neurons in hippocampus (I) and round normal intact neurons in
cortex (V) with normal nucleus. MCAO group showed the degenerated neurons (hippocampus, 35.69% and cortex, 50.82%) with
pycnotic nuclei and vacoulation as compared to sham group (II, VI;
Po 0.001). PA administered group decreased the neuronal loss
in P50þ MCAO (III, VII; hippocampus: 27.89%, cortex: 42.03%;
Po 0.01) and P100 þMCAO (IV, VIII; hippocampus: 23.89%, cortex:
27.28%; Po 0.001) groups leading to protected normal architecture
of neurons as compared to MCAO group (Fig. 3).
3.4. Effect of PA on I–R induced oxidative stress
MCAO group showed the signiﬁcant enhanced level of TBARS in
frontal cortex (Po0.01) and hippocampus (P o0.01) as compared
to sham group whereas, PA treatment attenuated the level of
TBARS in frontal cortex and hippocampus in both groups
[P50þ MCAO (Po 0.05) and P100 þMCAO (P o0 01)] as compared
to MCAO group. P100 þS group has not shown any signiﬁcant
alteration as compared to sham group (Table 1).
GSH level and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, GPx,
and GR) were signiﬁcantly decreased in frontal cortex and hippocampus of MCAO group (P o0.01) in comparison to sham group.
PA administration in P100 þMCAO group (Po 0.01) augmented
the GSH and the activities of CAT, GPx, and GR to near normal
values in hippocampus and frontal cortex of as compared to MCAO
group. A protective effect of PA in P50 þ MCAO group was observed
on GSH, CAT and GPx but not on GR. No signiﬁcant change was
observed in P100þ S group as compared to sham group (Table 1).
On the bases of above histological and biochemical results,
P100 (100 mg/kg b.wt) dose was found to be best against I–R
injury. Therefore, further studies associated with the effects of
P100 on inﬂammation were carried out only in P100 þMCAO
group.

Fig. 1. Effect of PA on behavioral deﬁcits. I–R injury induced a neurological severity, FT (A) and SMA (B) in MCAO group. PA treatment decreased the severity of FT and SMA in
P50 þ MCAO and P100þ MCAO groups signiﬁcantly as compared to sham group. Feeble grip strength (C) and poor motor coordination (D) were observed in MCAO group as
compared to sham group. PA treatment improved these tests in P50 þ MCAO and P100þ MCAO groups signiﬁcantly in a dose dependent manner whereas, P25 þMCAO group
has not restored these tests. ♯P o0.01, MCAO vs. sham; *P o0.05 and **Po 0.01 vs. MCAO (n¼ 8).

3.5. Effect of PA on proinﬂammatory cytokines
MCAO group animals showed a signiﬁcant increment of IL-1β,
TNF-α and IL-6 in hippocampus (Po 0.01) and frontal cortex
(P o0.01) as compared to sham group. PA treatment decreased
the level of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 in P100 þMCAO group (P o0.05)
signiﬁcantly as compared to MCAO group (Fig. 4).
3.6. Effect of PA on expressions of COX-2, NOS-2 and NF-κB
The immunohistological studies of ipsilateral cortex of MCAO
group showed the upregulated expressions of COX-2, NOS-2
and NF-κB (II, V, VIII) respectively as compared to sham group
whereas, sham group showed the basal level of COX-2, NOS-2 and
NF-κB expressions (I, IV, VII). However, PA-treatment (P100 þ
MCAO) successfully reduced the expression of these inﬂammatory
mediators; COX-2, NOS-2 and NF-κB (III, VI, IX) respectively as
compared to MCAO group (Fig. 5).
4. Discussion
The present study revealed the neuroprotective efﬁcacy of PA in
a dose dependent manner against I–R injury that was explored by

reduced infarct volume, protected histology and augmented antioxidant status thereby improved functional outcomes. The most
commonly occluded vessel, middle cerebral artery is responsible
for embolic and thrombotic stroke at clinical level. For this reason,
murine transient MCAO model is still the best suitable model to
study I–R injury with reperfusion, it mimics most of the human
stroke cases (Durukan and Tatlisumak, 2007; Tabassum et al.,
2013). Oxidative stress is very initial event that starts at the initial
period of I–R injury. Profound amount of reactive oxygen species is
generated as a consequent of I–R injuries thereby, resulting into
oxidative stress, blood brain barrier damage, and generation of
proinﬂammatory mediators leading to neuronal damage and
ultimately results in disturbed functional and histological outcomes (Vaibhav et al., 2012). It has also reported that neuronal
damage due to I–R injury in hippocampus and cortex region
results memory impairments and motor dysfunction (Sun et al.,
2010; Vaibhav et al., 2013a). Disturbed motor function is attributed
to motor neuron damage in cortex region. Congruity to earlier
reports, increased neurological severity related to FT and SMA as
well as weak grip strength and impaired motor coordination were
observed in MCAO group (Khan et al., 2009; Tabassum et al., 2013;
Vaibhav et al., 2013a). Conversely, PA treatment might have
scavenged the reactive oxygen species and ultimately reduced
the oxidative stress as well as inﬂammatory mediators which led

to better neurological and behavioral outcomes as reported in
previous studies (Raza et al. 2011; Vaibhav et al., 2012). Furthermore, higher dose of PA (100 mg/kg) was seemed to be more
effective in behavioral improvement and infarct volume reduction
suggesting that higher dose may provide the optimum level in
circulation in brain to confer neuroprotection.
It is well documented that histological outcomes provide direct
evidence to assess the extent of neuronal injury and protection by
therapeutic means (Tabassum et al., 2013; Vaibhav et al., 2013a).
TTC staining based on the principle where TTC converted to red
formazone due to presence of mitochondrial dehydogenase in
viable intact cells (Bederson et al., 1986; Tabassum et al., 2013).
Remarkable infarction as a white color (unstained area) was
demonstrated in ischemic group (MCAO) that indicates the neuronal damage due to I–R injury (Vaibhav et al. 2012; Tabassum
et al., 2013). Furthermore, H&E staining of ipsilateral CA1 hippocampus and cortex regions presented the tissue damage in a form
of highly degenerated neurons with vacuolation and pycnotic
nuclei in ischemic group (Ahmad et al., 2012; Tabassum et al.,
2013; Vaibhav et al., 2013b). Moreover, PA treatment improved
histology in both TTC and H&E staining attributed to antioxidant
and anti-inﬂammatory potential of PA that mediates neuroprotection as corroborated by earlier published evidences (Ashafaq et al.,
2012; Muley et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012).
Reactive oxygen species is decisively responsible for oxidative
peroxidation of lipid, leading to membrane dysfunction and ﬁnally

forms malondialdehyde (MDA) (Adibhatla and Hatcher, 2008;
Mattson, 2009; Hu et al., 2012). TBA with MDA forms TBARS, an
indirect scale of LPO (Islam et al., 2002). GSH, the primary
endogenous antioxidant confers neuroprotection against neuronal
damage caused by oxygen free radicals and lipid peroxides
(Dringen, 2000; Ahmad et al., 2012). In the present study,
enhanced TBARS concentration and decreased GSH level in
ischemic group were observed in MCAO group. Administration of
PA decreased TBARS accompanied by augmented GSH level mainly
attributed to antioxidant property of PA as reported earlier (Khan
et al., 2009; Muley et al., 2012; Vaibhav et al., 2012). Generally, the
brain is protected against oxidative damage caused by the free
radicals by the endogenous antioxidant enzymes as GPx, GR, and
CAT (Wu et al., 2009, 2012). GPx is known for the detoxiﬁcation of
H2O2 by utilizing GSH as substrate (Wu et al., 1999; Hoehn et al.,
2003). GR is responsible for regeneration of GSH (Tabassum et al.,
2013). In addition, CAT substantially detoxiﬁes the H2O2 as GPx
and also protects the brain from more toxic OH when SOD is
insufﬁcient to remove O2 (Wu et al., 1999; Tabassum et al., 2013).
However, GPx, GR, and CAT were also found to be decreased in
MCAO group as reported earlier (Wang et al., 2012; Tabassum et
al., 2013). It is speculated that antioxidant property of PA might be
responsible for protection of the brain tissue from toxic reactive
oxygen species, H2O2, hydroxyl ions and boosted the activity of
these enzymes to normal as reported in earlier studies (Hou et al.,
2010; Sun et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2011).

Inﬂammation is another important event that may occur as
a consequence of oxidative stress and contributes an important
role in strengthening the I–R injury (Wang et al., 2007; Lakhan
et al., 2009; Jin et al., 2010; Nagel et al., 2012). I–R injury which

recruits and activates various inﬂammatory cells to secret proinﬂammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) that reach maximum
level within 24 h (Ozbal et al., 2008; Lakhan et al., 2009). IL-1β, IL-6
and TNF-α also promotes the effective adhesion and proliferation of

Fig. 4. Effect of PA on cytokines level. Proinﬂammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) were increased in the hippocampus and frontal cortex region. Contrary, these
cytokines were decreased signiﬁcantly in PA treated P100þ MCAO group as compared to MCAO group (A and B). Values are expressed as mean 7 S.E.M (n¼ 6). ♯Po 0.01,

leukocyte, macrophages, activated microglia which inﬁltrate into
ischemic region consequently, reinforce further neuronal damage.
This study demonstrated that enhanced level of these proinﬂammatory cytokines in MCAO group due to I–R injury was remarkably
decreased with PA administration indicates the anti-inﬂammatory
activity of PA which is also in consistent with earlier reports where
active compound found to be protective due to down regulation of
IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α against I–R induced inﬂammation (Ozbal
et al., 2008; Hou et al., 2010; Vaibhav et al., 2012). It is suggested
that PA might have interfered the inﬂammatory processes through
amelioration of cytokines levels in ischemic brain (Ozbal et al.,
2008; Khan et al., 2011; Vaibhav et al., 2012). However, apart from
elevated proinﬂammatory cytokines, other inducible proinﬂammatory enzymes, COX-2, NOS-2 and NF-κB are also answerable for
pathological inﬂammation in I–R injury. Nitric oxide (NO) produced
by NOS-2 and its oxidative by-products, peroxynitrite that leads to
structural neuronal protein oxidation along with prostaglandin
formation by COX-2, crucially intensify the neuronal injury in stroke
(Wang et al., 2003; Jung et al., 2009). In present study, high
expression of NOS-2 and COX-2 were observed in MCAO group
which was decreased remarkably ascribed to anti- inﬂammatory
effect of PA treatment that was also consistent with the earlier
reports (Vaibhav et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2012). NO produced by
activated NOS-2 disrupts the microvascular integrity and forms
edema (Clancy and Abramson, 1995). Furthermore, NO triggers the
COX-2 to release more inﬂammatory prostaglandins and IL-1β and
TNF-α (Nédélec et al., 2001; Madrigal et al., 2003). I–R injury
induces the up regulation of COX-2 at 6 h after ischemia and attains
maximum level within 12–24 h and subsided at 48 h. Sasaki et al.
(2004) also explored the decreased MCAO induced injury in COX-2
deﬁcient mice. Hence, NOS-2 and COX-2 attested as a crucial
supports in I–R induced inﬂammation (Vaibhav et al., 2012; Ma
et al., 2013). More importantly, NF-κB is a vital transcription factor
which drives the trancriptional regulation of various inﬂammatory
mediators, viz. proinﬂammatory cytokines, and inducible NOS-2,
and COX-2 which are crosslink to each other (Harari and Liao, 2010;
Maddahi and Edvinsson, 2010). Various stimuli, as reactive oxygen
species, prostaglandin, proinﬂammatory cytokines involve in NF-κB
activation leading to NF-κB inhibitor (IκB) phosphorylation, ubiqitination and translocation (P55:P65) to nucleus and induces expression of inﬂammatory genes which consequently intensify the I–R
injury (Harari and Liao, 2010; Vaibhav et al., 2012). Therefore,

assessment of NF-κB was eventually obligatory to explore the
underlying anti-inﬂammatory effect of PA against I–R injury in
our study and demonstrated the expression of NF-κB in MCAO
group as stated earlier (Vaibhav et al., 2012).
According to our results, it was found that PA treatment prior to
MCAO ameliorated the expression of NF-κB that might have been
responsible for down regulation of NOS-2, COX-2 and decreased
level of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α cytokines thereby attenuated the I–R
induced inﬂammation (Vaibhav et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2012; Gu
et al., 2012). NF-KB has a role in modulation of voltage-dependent
calcium channels and glutamate receptors that results many
pathophysiological processes that is responsible for ischemic
injury (Furukawa and Mattson, 1998). It has been previously
reported that PA administration mediated a noticeable reduction
of NF-kB levels at 4 and 24 h in the WEHI-231 cells and Bcl-XL
cells at 24 h (Berchtold et al., 2005).
Therefore, in this study, inhibition of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α
level and down regulation of COX-2, NOS-2 and NF-κB has
explored the anti-inﬂammatory effects of PA against I–R injury.
The progress of I–R induced inﬂammation is attributed to activation of NOS-2, COX-2 and NF-κB and IL-1β, IL-6 and being
activated by each other (Vaibhav et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., 2013). Therefore, amelioration of these inﬂammatory
mediators seems to be important target for anti-ischemic therapy.
PA lipophilic in nature, could be able to cross the blood brain
barrier and might have augmented protection by attenuation of
oxidative stress and related neuronal injury. Therefore, these
ﬁndings recommend PA as anti inﬂammatory as well as antioxidant agent against I–R injury.
In conclusion, PA treatment ameliorated I–R injury that leads to
decreased lipid peroxidation, restored endogenous antioxidant
system. Further, PA also mitigated the inﬂammation by inhibiting
IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, NOS-2 COX-2 and NF-κβ expressions. The
data of this study indicate that PA interferes with crucial pathological cascade associated with oxidative stress and inﬂammation
in parts, as evident by improved neurological, behavioral and
histological outcomes. Therefore, PA may be considered as good
antioxidant and anti inﬂammatory agent against I–R injury that
lead to neuroprotection and might be useful as a preventive stroke
treatment. However, a more mechanistic study is desired with the
treatment at or post-I–R injury to completely understand the
protective mechanism afforded by PA.
