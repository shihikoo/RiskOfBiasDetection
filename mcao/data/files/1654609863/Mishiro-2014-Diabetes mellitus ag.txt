Abstract
Diabetes is a crucial risk factor for stroke and is associated with increased frequency and poor prognosis. Although
endothelial dysfunction is a known contributor of stroke, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. The aim of
this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which chronic hyperglycemia may contribute to the worsened prognosis
following stroke, especially focusing on mitochondrial alterations. We examined the effect of hyperglycemia on
hemorrhagic transformation at 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in streptozotocin (STZ) -induced
diabetic mice. We also examined the effects of high-glucose exposure for 6 days on cell death, mitochondrial functions and
morphology in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVECs) or human endothelial cells derived from induced
pluripotent stem cells (iCell endothelial cells). Hyperglycemia aggravated hemorrhagic transformation, but not infarction
following stroke. High-glucose exposure increased apoptosis, capase-3 activity, and release of apoptosis inducing factor
(AIF) and cytochrome c in HBMVECs as well as affected mitochondrial functions (decreased cell proliferation, ATP contents,
mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity, but not reactive oxygen
species production). Furthermore, morphological aberration of mitochondria was observed in diabetic cells (a great deal of
fragmentation, vacuolation, and cristae disruption). A similar phenomena were seen also in iCell endothelial cells. In
conclusion, chronic hyperglycemia aggravated hemorrhagic transformation after stroke through mitochondrial dysfunction
and morphological alteration, partially via MMP-9 activation, leading to caspase-dependent apoptosis of endothelial cells of
diabetic mice. Mitochondria-targeting therapy may be a clinically innovative therapeutic strategy for diabetic complications
in the future.

in animal models [12–14]. In addition, many deleterious pathways
involved in the aggravation of the cerebrovascular disorder that
results from DM have been reported, including oxidative stress
[15], impaired leukocyte function [16], abnormal angiogenesis
[17], increased blood-brain barrier permeability [18], and other
inflammatory responses [19–21]. Nevertheless, the mechanisms
underlying the adverse effects of chronic hyperglycemia on
cerebral blood vessels have not been fully elucidated.
Mitochondria are complex organelles that perform diverse vital
functions such as cellular metabolism, growth, differentiation, and
homeostasis. In particular, they play a critical role in cell survival
and death by regulating ATP synthesis through lipid and glucose
metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, calcium
homeostasis, apoptosis stimulation, and aging [22,23]. Therefore,
any alterations in these mitochondrial functions can greatly affect
cell fate and tissue function, and occasionally accelerate the
morbidity in a fatal capacity.
The importance of altered mitochondrial dynamics in DM is
being increasingly recognized [24]. Recent works have demon-

Introduction
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a severe health problem of epidemic
proportions, which continues to expand exponentially worldwide:
it is projected that 347 million people are affected and it will reach
439 million by the year 2030 [1–3]. Stroke is a major complication
in DM patients, and DM increases the risk of stroke by 1.5 to 3fold as compared to the general population [4–7]. Several
epidemiological studies have suggested that ischemic stroke
patients with DM display a distinct risk-factor and etiologic profile
as well as a worse vascular prognosis, higher in-hospital mortality,
and slower functional recovery than non-DM patients [8,9]. A
chronically high-level of serum glucose may be a key contributor
to the poor outcome observed after cerebral ischemia in DM
patients [10].
Many factors contribute to the poor prognosis in stroke patients
with DM. Importantly, chronic hyperglycemia is associated with
hemorrhagic complications in acute ischemic stroke patients who
received thrombolytic therapy [11]; this has also been confirmed

strated various abnormalities in mitochondrial networks under
hyperglycemic conditions in a variety of cell types, including islet
cells [25,26], hepatocytes [27], skeletal muscle cells [28,29],
circulating blood mononuclear cells [30], and retinal or coronary
endothelial cells [31,32]. However, their role in the human
cerebrovascular endothelial cells is currently unknown.
The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which
chronic hyperglycemia may contribute to the worsened prognosis
following stroke in DM patients. We used human brain
microvascular endothelial cells, and investigated the effects of
chronic high-glucose exposure on apoptotic cell death, mitochondrial functions, and morphological alterations to clarify the
pathophysiological roles of mitochondria in DM. Finally, we
examined the effects of chronic high-glucose exposure on highly
purified human endothelial cells derived from induced pluripotent
stem (iPS) cells which supposed to more stabilized result.

Infarct volume assessment
At 21 h after the reperfusion, mice were killed by decapitation.
Brains were immediately removed and cut into 5 serial 2-mmthick coronal block slices. These slices were immersed in a 2%
solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) for 20 min. Image- J imageprocessing software was used to measure the unstained areas of the
total infarctions, and the infarct volume was calculated as reported
previously [34] (Control; n = 7, Diabetes; n = 6).

Spectrophotometric assay of hemoglobin content
At 21 h after reperfusion, mice were given an overdose of
pentobarbital sodium (Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma, Osaka,
Japan) and transcardially perfused with cold saline. Brains were
immediately removed and cut into 5 serial 2-mm-thick coronal
block slices. In our preliminary study, we found that the
reproducibly largest infarct size was in the cortical region of the
left hemisphere on the anterior fourth slice. Therefore, we analyze
the extent of hemorrhagic transformation in this area. After
adding 10 ml/g of saline to individual samples, they were
homogenized, followed by 30-min of centrifugation
(13,000 rpm). A 200 ml volume of reagent (QuantiChrom
Hemoglobin Assay Kit; BioAssay Systems, CA, USA) was then
added to 50 ml of supernatant. After 15 min, optical density was
measured at 400 nm with a spectrophotometer (Skan It RE for
Varioskan 133 Flash 2.4; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA). The total hemoglobin content was expressed as
micrograms per sample (Control; n = 11, Diabetes; n = 12).

Materials and Methods
Animal model
The experimental designs and all procedures were approved by
the Gifu Pharmaceutical University Animal Experimental Committee. All procedures relating to animal care and treatment
conformed to the animal care guidelines of this committee. All in
vivo experiments were performed using male ddY mice (3 weeks
old; body weight, 10–20 g; Japan SLC Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan). A
model of diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of
streptozotocin (STZ) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka,
Japan) (100 mg/kg/day dissolved in saline) twice on alternativedays. Mice were housed for an additional 4 weeks without insulin
supplements. During this period, the vehicle group received i.p.
injections of saline, without STZ, under the same dosing regimen
(time and volume) used in the STZ-treated group. We monitored
body weight for 4 weeks (Fig. 1B). Following the 4-week period, an
experimental MCAO model was prepareed as previously
described [33]. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 2.0 to 2.5%
isofluorane in 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide via a facemask
(Soft Lander; Sin-ei Industry, Saitama, Japan). An 8-0 nylon
monofilament (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) was used via the
internal carotid artery to induce focal cerebral ischemia. After 3 h
of occlusion, the nylon was gently withdrawn to restore blood flow
in the MCA territory and the incision was closed. In all animals,
body temperature was maintained between 37.0 and 37.5uC
during surgery, with the aid of a heating lamp and heating pad. At
21 h after the reperfusion (just before the sampling), blood samples
were collected from the inferior vena cava and serum glucose
levels were determined using a glucose detection kit (Glucose CII
Test Wako). Animals with blood glucose levels exceeding 300 mg/
dL were selected as the ‘‘diabetic mice’’ and were used for
subsequent experiments. In this study, we used a total of 61 mice
and excluded 17 mice (27.7%) based on the criteria for exclusion,
which we set before the experiments. Exclusion criteria were as
follows: (a) abnormal serum glucose levels, (b) death due to
excessive anesthesia or technical problems during operations, and
(c) no infarction in the core area. All experiments were performed

Cell cultures and incubation under various glucose
concentrations
Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVECs) (Cell
Systems, Kirkland, WA, USA) and iCell endothelial cells (iPS
Academia Japan, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) were cultured in 100-mm
dishes in HuMedia EG2 (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan), supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and VascuLife
VEGF Medium (Kurabo) supplemented with specialized iCell
Endothelial Cells Medium Supplement, respectively, at 37uC
under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere until they reached 80%
confluence. Cells were then transferred into culture plates (16104
cells/cm2) and cultured until they reached confluence. After
confluence was achieved, the medium was changed to the
conditioned medium containing 5.5 mM (equivalent to the
physiological glucose concentration; used as a control),
16.5 mM, or 30 mM (high-glucose exposure) glucose concentrations, and cultivated for an additional 6 days (Fig. 2A). During this
period, the culture medium was replaced every 2 days.

Nuclear staining assays
We evaluated the cell numbers by nuclear staining assays using
the fluorescent dye: Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,

USA). After high-glucose exposure for 6 days, Hoechst 33342 was
added, followed by incubation for 15 min (a final concentration of
Hoechst 33342, 8.1 mM). Images were collected using an Olympus
IX70 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan). The total number of cells was counted in a blind manner.

TUNEL staining
TUNEL staining was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols (In Situ Cell Death Detection kit; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Briefly, cells were fixed in a freshly
prepared 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 1 h, and then blocked
in 3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min. Cells were further
permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in citric sodium for 2 min
on ice. Cells were then incubated with terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase enzyme at 37uC for 1 h, and subsequently
incubated with an anti-fluorescein antibody peroxidase conjugate
in a humidified chamber for 30 min. Next, the reaction was
developed using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride peroxidase
substrate. Light microscope images were photographed in five
areas per well, and the number of TUNEL-positive cells was
counted.

Subcellular fractionation

Caspase 3 and 7 activation measurement

Measurement of cellular ROS production

To isolate cytosol and nuclear components, we used ProteoExtract Subcellular Proteome Extraction Kit (Calbiochem, San
Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Furthermore, to isolate cytosol and mitochondria, we used a
Mitochondria Isolation Kit for Cultured Cells (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was assessed by culturing cells in a
conditioned medium containing 10% WST-8 (Cell Counting
Kit-8; Dojin Kagaku, Kumamoto, Japan) for 3 h at 37uC, and
then scanning with a microplate reader (Varioskan Flash 2.4;
Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Caspase 3 and 7 was measured by using Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After high-glucose exposure for 6 days, caspase-Glo
3/7 Reagent was added in a 1:1 ratio of reagent volume to the
sample volume. Thereafter, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37uC.
The luminescence of each sample was measured using a
microplate reader (Varioskan Flash 2.4; Thermo Fisher Scientific).

To evaluate cellular ROS production, we examined the levels of
hydrogen peroxide using 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-29,79-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA; Invitrogen). Treated cells were incubated with CM-H2DCFDA for 1 h at
37uC and then washed with PBS. Fluorescent signals were
measured using a Varioskan Flash 2.4 microplate reader (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) at 485 nm (excitation) and 535 nm (emission).

Immunoblotting

Detection of MMP-2 and MMP-9

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 1%
protease inhibitor cocktail and 1% of each phosphatase inhibitor
cocktails 2 and 3 (Sigma-Aldrich), and harvested. Lysates were
agitated with rotated slowly for 3 h at 4uC. Protein concentrations
were measured using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA) with a bovine serum albumin standard.
Thereafter, equal volumes of protein sample and sample buffer
were mixed, and the samples were boiled for 5 min at 100uC. The
samples (2 mg protein/well) were subjected to 5–20% SDS-PAGE
gradient electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore). For immunoblotting, the following primary antibodies were used: mouse antiActive Caspase-3 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Genlantis, San Diego,
CA, USA), mouse anti-Caspase-7 antibody (1:1000 dilution; MBL,
Nagoya, Japan), mouse anti-AIF antibody (1:1000 dilution; Santa
Cruz, CA, USA), mouse anti-cytochrome c antibody (1:200
dilution; Santa Cruz), mouse anti-b3-Tubulin antibody (1:1000
dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), rabbit
anti-c-Jun antibody (1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology),
mouse anti-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal antibody (1:10 dilution: JaICA,
Shizuoka, Japan), mouse anti-HSP60 antibody (1:1000 dilution;
StressMarq Biosciences, Victoria, BC, Canada), rabbit antiVDAC1 antibody (1:100 dilution; Abgent, Inc., San Diego, CA,
USA), and b-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution;
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

We examined MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity using a gelatin
zymography kit (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan). In brief, samples
(5 mg protein/well) were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide
gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin as substrate. After electrophoresis,
gels were incubated in the Wash buffer at room temperature for
1 h with gentle shaking. The gel was further incubated in enzyme
reaction buffer at 37uC for 40 h. After incubation, the gel was
immersed in staining solution for 30 min, followed by de-staining
solution for 3 h. Proteinase activity was detected as unstained
bands on a blue background, representing areas of gelatin
digestion. The bands were quantified using Image-J.

Mitochondrial membrane potential assay
After high-glucose exposure for 6 days, 50 mM of tetramethyl
rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), the active mitochondrial probe was added to the cell
culture and further incubated for 1 h at 37uC. Images were
collected using an Olympus IX70 inverted epifluorescence
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), which detects active
mitochondria with intense fluorescence (excitation/emission = 549/573 nm). Intensity was calculated using Image-J in a
blind manner.

cultivated for an additional 6 days. During this period, the culture
medium was replaced every 2 days. After high-glucose exposure
for 6 days, mitochondria was stained by anti HSP60 antibodies as
described previously. The number of mitochondria was determinated quantity by using Image-J image-processing software.

ATP contents
After high-glucose exposure for 6 days, the cell culture medium
was removed from plates, and cells were washed three times with
PBS. Lysis buffer (200 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 M NaCl, 20 mM
EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) was added to lysed cells. ATP
Determinant Kit reaction solution (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA) was added at a volume of 90 ml per well to 10 ml per
well of cell lysate. Plates were agitated for 2 min and luminescence
was measured.

Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as mean 6 SEM. Statistical analysis for
the quantitative variable was performed using a one- or two-way
ANOVA followed by Student’s t-test, Dunnett’s test, or Tukey’s
test. The frequencies of death (mortality) were compared by Chisquare test. P,0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Analyses were performed using STAT VIEW version 5.0 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Immunostaining
Cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS
and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After
blocking, cells were incubated with primary antibodies; mouse
anti-HSP60 antibody (1:1000 dilution; StressMarq Biosciences)
and rabbit anti-CD31 antibody (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA, USA).
After washing in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with fluorescent-linked secondary antibodies (1:1000
dilution; Pierce Biotechnology). Cells were counterstained for
5 min with Hoechst 33342/PBS solution. The labeled cells were
mounted on glass slides and observed under a confocal microscope
(FV10i, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Results
Body weight, blood glucose levels, and mortality
The in vivo experimental protocol is represented in Fig. 1A. At
4 weeks after STZ-treatment, diabetic mice showed siginificantly
lower weight and approximately 3 times higher blood glucose
levels than control mice (Fig. 1B and C). There was no significant
difference in mortality (P = 0.0951) (Fig. 1D).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

Effects of chronic hyperglycemia on hemorrhagic
transformation after ischemic stroke

Cell suspension pellets were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in
0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4uC overnight and then post
fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. After dehydration in a
series of graded through ethanol, specimens were embedded in
Epon 812. Ultrathin sections were cut on a Poster-Blum MT-1
ultra microtome (Ivan Sorvall, Inc., Norwalk, CT, USA), stained
with uranyl acetate and lead salts, and examined with a JEM 1010
transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The
decision criterion of abnormal mitochondria were set as collapse of
cristae structure or apparent vacuolation, which was quantified in
a blinded-manner.

There were no significant differences in infarct area and volume
between the groups (Fig. 1E). However, diabetic mice exhibited
noticeable aggravation of hemorrhagic transformation in comparison with control mice at 21 h after the reperfusion (Fig. 1F).

Effects of chronic high-glucose exposure on cell death
The in vitro experimental protocol is represented in Fig. 2A.
High-glucose exposure for 6 days significantly decreased cell
numbers compared with a normal glucose concentration
(5.5 mM), as shown by nuclear staining (Fig. 2B). Furthermore,
the number of TUNEL-positive cells was markedly increased
following high-glucose exposure (Fig. 2C), suggesting that this cell
death, at least in part, was due to cellular apoptosis. We then
explored the mechanism of this apoptotic cell death. High-glucose
exposure significantly increased the activities of caspase-3/7
(Fig. 2D). Of these caspases, immunoblotting analysis indicated
that caspase-3, but not caspase-7, activity was significantly
increased by high-glucose exposure (Fig. 2E and F). Moreover,
we examined the effect of high-glucose exposure on a caspaseindependent pathway. The release of both apoptosis inducing
factor (AIF) and cytochrome c was significantly accelerated by
high-glucose exposure. However, no significant difference in
nuclear transit of AIF and cytochrome c was observed (Fig. 2G).
These results suggest that high -glucose exposure may induce
endothelial apoptotic cell death through the activation of a
caspase-dependent pathway.

MitoSOX analysis
The mitochondrial superoxide level was evaluated by MitoSOX
Red Mitochondrial Superoxide Indicator, for live-cell imaging
which was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Life Technologies Japan, Osaka, Japan), according to the product Information.
After high-glucose exposure for 6 days, EBM-2 medium was
removed and 100 mL of 5 mM MitoSOX reagent working solution
was applied to cover cells. Incubate cells for 10 minutes at 37uC,
protected from light. After incubation, cells were washed gently
three times with 100 mL warm PBS. The absorbance at 510/
580 nm was measured using a microplate reader.

Effect of MMP-9 inhibitor on mitochondrial number in
high-glucose exposure
In order to confirm that MMP-9 may actually contribute to the
mitochondrial defect, we evaluated the effect of selective MMP-9
inhibitor on normal mitochondrial number. After confluence was
achieved, the medium was changed to the conditioned medium
containing 5.5 mM glucose (control),30 mM glucose(high-glucose,
HG), 30 mM glucose plus 100 nM MMP-9 inhibitor, and

cells. Before the experiment, we confirmed that the iPS cells
differentiated into normal endothelial cells, by using CD31
immunostaining (Fig. 5A). We measured three parameters: cell
proliferation by WST-8 assay, cell numbers by nuclear staining
assay, and apoptotic cell death by TUNEL staining. High-glucose
exposure significantly decreased cell proliferation and cell numbers, and increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 5B–
D). These results were consistent with our previous studies in
HBMVECs.

evaluated three parameters: cell proliferation by the WST-8 assay,
ATP contents by the luciferase-based assay, and mitochondrial
membrane potential by measuring the TMRM intensity. A
significant impairment in all of these functional assessments
occurred in high-glucose exposed cells, suggesting that chronic
high-glucose exposure may induce mitochondrial dysfunction
(Fig. 3A–C). To elucidate the mechanism of this mitochondrial
dysfunction, we next examined ROS generation and MMP-2 and
MMP-9 activities. We observed that high-glucose exposure did not
affect ROS production (Fig. 3D). In agreement with this result, the
binding levels of 4-HNE, the major biologically active aldehyde
generated from peroxidation of membrane lipids, were not
different between the groups (Fig. 3E). In addition, the activity
of superoxide dismutase (SOD), which is one of the most
important antioxidative enzymes to inactivate the superoxide
anion, was not changed by high-glucose exposure (Fig. S1).
Moreover, the mitochondrial superoxide level also was not
changed by high-glucose exposure (Fig. S3). Alternately, a
significant increase of active MMP-9, but not MMP-2, was
observed in high-glucose exposed cells (Fig. 3F). Selective MMP-9
inhibitor significantly increased cell proliferation decreased by
high-glucose exposure (Fig. S2) and the number of mitochondria
was decreased by high-glucose exposure, but this result was
suppressed by the administration of an MMP-9 inhibitor (Fig. S4).
These data suggest that chronic high-glucose exposure may induce
mitochondrial dysfunction, at least in part, via upregulation of
MMP-9, in an ROS-independent manner.

Discussion
In this study, we used STZ-induced diabetic mice as a model of
the chronic complications that occur in human diabetes mellitus.
After 4 weeks after STZ administration, the blood glucose level in
diabetic mice was 3 times higher than that in control mice. In
addition, there was a marked weight loss in diabetic mice along
with evident polyposia and polyuria tendency, which closely
resemble clinical symptoms of DM. After ischemia/reperfusion
injury by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), infarct area
and volume were not altered by diabetes; however, hemorrhagic
volume was significantly larger in diabetic mice than in the control
mice. This result is consistent with those of previous reports
[15,35,36], suggesting that chronic hyperglycemia aggravates
hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke in mice.
Endothelial dysfunction is considered one of the main contributors of complications in DM; therefore, we next focused on brain
microvascular endothelial cells and conducted several experiments
to clarify the effects of chronic high-glucose exposure in vitro. We
established an in vitro diabetic model by incubating cells in a highglucose environment (16.5 or 30 mM) for 6 days because highglucose exposure at a concentration of 30 mM for 6 days increases
endothelial permeability in the brain [37]. In our study, chronic
high-glucose exposure resulted in increased apoptotic cell death.
Few studies have thus far examined the influence of hyperglycemia
on apoptosis in brain microvascular endothelial cells; however
high-glucose-induced endothelial apoptosis has been reported in
other cell types including human cavernous endothelial cells,
human coronary artery endothelial cells and pancreatic islet
endothelial cells [38–40]. Despite these efforts, no consensus on
the underlying mechanisms of apoptotic cell death in DM has
been achieved. There are two main apoptosis pathways: caspasedependent and caspase-independent. We first examined the
activities of caspase-3 and -7. High-glucose exposure significantly
increased the activity of caspase-3, but not caspase-7. On the other
hand, high-glucose exposure promoted the releases of proapoptotic peptides, AIF, and cytochrome c into the cytosol;
however, there was no significant difference in nuclear transit.
These results suggest that chronic high-glucose exposure induces
apoptotic cell death through the activation of a caspase-dependent
pathway in HBMVECs.
Most importantly, we provided novel findings regarding the
functional and morphological consequences of altered mitochondrial dynamics under hyperglycemic conditions in HBMVECs.
Several previous studies showed that diabetic conditions disrupt
mitochondrial integrity in different cell types. For instance,
incubation of rat retinal endothelial cells with high-glucose

Effects of chronic high-glucose exposure on
mitochondrial morphology
In an attempt to characterize the mitochondrial changes that
occur under chronic high-glucose exposure in more detail, we
investigated the morphological alteration of the mitochondria.
Immunostaining of HSP60, used as a marker of normal
mitochondria, revealed that the mitochondria in high-glucoseexposed cells exhibited apparent shortened forms and fragmentation (Fig. 4A). However, the accumulation of HSP60 in mitochondria was not altered, indicating that the mitochondrial
changes were qualitative rather than quantitative (Fig. 4B). We
used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis to further
characterize the morphological effects of high-glucose exposure.
Predictably, high-glucose exposure induced massive fragmentation, vacuolation, and cristae disruption. Furthermore, a marked
hypertrophy of mitochondria was observed in high-glucose
exposed cells compared with control cells. We also found that
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) gathered in close proximity to the
mitochondria denatured by high-glucose exposure. In addition,
autophagosomal-like structures contained mitochondria were
observed in some places. (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that
chronic high-glucose exposure induces considerable disturbance of
mitochondrial morphology.

Figure 6. Diagram illustrating the postulated mechanism through which hyperglycemia aggravates hemorrhagic transformation
after ischemic stroke. Hyperglycemia increases the activity of MMP-9 in an ROS-independent manner, which promotes the opening of
mitochondrial permeability transition pores (mitochondrial depolarization; Dym QQ). The mitochondria that have lost normal function can no
longer produce ATP, and emit various pro-apoptotic factors, such as AIF and cytochrome c into the cytosol. These factors subsequently activate
caspase-3 and induce apoptotic cell death in HBMVECs. On the other hand, functional failure leads to morphological alteration of mitochondria,
(fragmentation, vacuolation, cristae disruption). Eventually, both of these functional and morphological disturbances result in the aggravation of
hemorrhagic transformation after ischemic stroke.

contents, and mitochondrial membrane potential) and induces
mitochondrial morphological alterations (massive fragmentation,
vacuolation, and cristae disruption). Hyperglycemia induces excess
ROS production, including O22, in many cell types [41–43],
leading to cellular apoptosis [42], abnormalities of cell cycling
[44], and delayed replication [43]. Interestingly, the present data
demonstrated that HBMVECs with hyperglycemia did not exhibit
higher production of ROS. Meanwhile, MMP-9 which is a
potentially deleterious neurovascular protease [45], associated with
blood-brain barrier disruption, neuronal apoptosis and survival
[46–48], was significantly upregulated under high-glucose expo-

containing medium induces the loss of mitochondrial networks
and increases apoptosis [31]. Moreover, exposure of rat hepatocytes to high-glucose induces mitochondrial fragmentation [27]. In
the most recent study by Makino et al., endothelial cells isolated
from the coronary arteries of diabetic mice displayed fragmented
mitochondria and increased ROS production [32]. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate the effects of
chronic hyperglycemia on the mitochondrial functions and
morphological alterations in HBMVECs.
Our results clearly demonstrated that high-glucose exposure
impairs mitochondrial functions (decreased cell proliferation, ATP

sure. In accordance with this finding, Kumari et al. reported an
increase in MMP-9 activity in diabetic db/db mice following
hypoxic-cerebral ischemia [47]. In fact, we confirmed that MMP-9
inhibition could partly improve mitochondrial function. Hence,
chronic hyperglycemia may exacerbate mitochondrial functions
possibly through other deleterious factors, which include, at least
in part, MMP-9, rather than via ROS production in the brain.
Further studies are required to completely elucidate the mechanisms of hyperglycemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions.
Interestingly, we found that many a ER gathered in close
proximity to the mitochondria denatured by high-glucose exposure. Furthermore, autophagosomal-like structures contained
mitochondria in some places. Therefore, a great deal of attention
is currently focused on the relationship between mitochondriaselective autophagy, called ‘‘mitophagy’’ and ER activities [49,50].
These observations are likely to support the possibility that
mitophagy is involved in the pathophysiology of DM via its close
relation to ER.
Recently, there has been a growing interest in research or drug
development using human iPS cells. In this study, we determined
whether similar dysfunctions observed in HBMVECs would also
occur in human iPS-induced endothelial cells, and observed
several results coincident with these in HBMVECs. The findings
strongly indicate that hyperglycemia decreases mitochondrial
enzymatic activity and increases apoptotic cell death in brain
microvascular endothelial cells.
There are several limitations in the present study. First, in vivo
MCAO experiments, we used STZ-induced diabetic mice model,
which normally induces Type I DM. Clinically most of diabetic
patients are classified as Type 2. In regard to this point, there are a
little bit differences in animal models. Second, we examined the
effect of hyperglycemia on mitochondrial defects only in vitro
study, thus further investigation is required to clarify whether these
results could be truly extrapolated to the results of in vivo study.
Additionally, in vitro experimental design, we only conducted in
the chronic high-glucose condition without any ischemic stimuli.
Although it makes reasonable to understand the deleterious effect
of chronic hyperglycemia on brain endothelial cells, another in
vitro stroke model (for example, hypoxia or oxygen glucose
deprivation) may be also necessary to match the in vivo MCAO
experiments.
In summary, chronic hyperglycemia aggravates hemorrhagic
transformation after ischemic stroke through mitochondrial
dysfunction and morphological alterations, partially via MMP-9
activation with ROS-independent manner; this leads to caspasedependent apoptotic cell death in endothelial cells (Fig. 6). Hence,
mitochondrial protection may lead to the mitigation of complications in DM, and mitochondria-targeting therapy may be a
clinically innovative therapeutic strategy for addressing diabetic
complications in the future.
