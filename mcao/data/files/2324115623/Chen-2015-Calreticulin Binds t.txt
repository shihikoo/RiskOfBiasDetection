Background. Calreticulin (CRT) can bind to Fas ligand (FasL) and inhibit Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat T cells. However,
its effect on neuronal cell apoptosis has not been investigated. Purpose. We aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of CRT
following ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Methods. Mice underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and SH-SY5Y
cells subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) were used as models for IRI. The CRT protein level was detected by Western
blotting, and mRNA expression of CRT, caspase-3, and caspase-8 was measured by real-time PCR. Immunofluorescence was used
to assess the localization of CRT and FasL. The interaction of CRT with FasL was verified by coimmunoprecipitation. SH-SY5Y
cell viability was determined by MTT assay, and cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The measurement of caspase-8 and
caspase-3 activity was carried out using caspase activity assay kits. Results. After IRI, CRT was upregulated on the neuron surface
and bound to FasL, leading to increased viability of OGD-exposed SH-SY5Y cells and decreased activity of caspase-8 and caspase-3.
Conclusions. This study for the first time revealed that increased CRT inhibited Fas/FasL-mediated neuronal cell apoptosis during
the early stage of ischemic stroke, suggesting it to be a potential protector activated soon after IRI.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke, with high morbidity and mortality, is the
most common type of stroke accounting for more than 80%
of all stroke cases. It can affect people of all ages. Previous
studies have shown both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
and neuronal apoptosis are involved in the progression of
ischemic stroke [1, 2].
The ER is an organelle responsible for protein synthesis
and folding. ER stress occurs under some pathological conditions, such as ischemic stroke [1]. Calreticulin (CRT) is a
conserved 46-kDa Ca2+ binding protein expressed virtually
in all nucleated cells and is located preferentially in the ER
[3]. As a chaperone molecular and a modulator of the Ca2+
balance, CRT resides mostly in the lumen of the ER, is
upregulated during ER stress, and transferred to outside the
cytomembrane [4].
Fas (also known as CD95 or APO-1) is a member of the
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family and promotes

apoptosis through a well-established pathway. Activation of
Fas can recruit and activate caspase-8, a cysteine protease,
which then induces cleavage of other protein substrates, such
as caspase-3, contributing to neuronal apoptosis [5, 6]. On
the cell surface, CRT has been found to bind to FasL (Fas
ligand), the ligand of Fas [7], and inhibit Fas/FasL-mediated
apoptosis of Jurkat T cells [4, 8]. Given that the Fas/FasL
pathway plays an important role in neuronal apoptosis during
ischemic stroke [2], we speculated that if CRT expression
is increased in the brain after ischemia-reperfusion injury
(IRI), CRT may bind to FasL and interfere with Fas/FasL
complexation, thereby protecting neurons from apoptosis
and relieving ischemia-related damage.
To date, the effect of CRT on neuronal apoptosis has
not been investigated. In this study, we observed upregulated
CRT expression after ischemia and interaction between
CRT and FasL, which led to reduced neuronal cell death,
suggesting a possible novel approach to protecting the brain
from IRI injury via based on CRT.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Experiment Animals. Kunming mice (10 per group, 25‚Äì
30 g, 4 weeks old, male : female = 1 : 1) were obtained from the
Experimental Animal Center of Nanjing University Medical
School, Nanjing, China. Fifty mice were divided into the
following five groups (ùëõ = 10 for each group): sham-operated
group and four groups (3 h-MCAO, 6 h-MCAO, 12 h-MCAO,
and 24 h-MCAO) in which middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) was performed and mice were killed at 3, 6, 12, or
24 h after reperfusion, respectively. A random block design
was carried out using SAS software. The investigators were
masked to the group assignments. The protocols for animal
experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.
2.2. MCAO Model. The MCAO model was generated as previously described by Zhang et al. [9]. Briefly, intraperitoneal
injection of ketamine (100 mg/mL) and xylazine (20 mg/kg)
mixture (1 : 1) (1 mL/kg) was applied to anesthetize the mice.
Mice were then subjected to MCAO using 6/0 monofilament
nylon sutures with heat-rounded tips inserted through the
internal carotid artery (ICA) into the beginning of the
middle cerebral artery (MCA). After 2 h of occlusion of the
MCA, the filament was withdrawn for blood reperfusion.
Three, six, twelve, or twenty-four hours later, the mice were
killed and the brain tissues were collected for real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, Western blotting,
and immunofluorescence staining. The sham-operated group
was treated using the same procedures as described above
except MCAO. The mortality of MCAO among the model
mice was approximately 10%.
2.3. SY5Y Cell Culture and Oxygen Glucose Deprivation
(OGD). SH-SY5Y cells (a neuroblastoma cell line) were provided by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and
cultured in Dulbecco‚Äôs Modified Eagle‚Äôs Medium (DMEM)
containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Gibco) with 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 ùúág/mL streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37‚àò C in
a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 . The in vitro OGD
model was established as described previously by Tarr et al.
[4]. Briefly, an oxygen-depleted, glucose-free medium was
applied to SH-SY5Y cells before incubation in a hypoxic
chamber (5% CO2 /95% N2 ) for 15 min. The chamber was
sealed, and incubation at 37‚àò C continued for 8 h. After OGD,
the cells were returned to normal medium with the presence
of different concentrations of CRT (Abcam, ab91577, UK) and
incubated for use in subsequent experiments.
2.4. Real-Time PCR. Real-time PCR was performed as
described previously [10]. Trizol reagent (Takara, Dalian,
China) was used to extract total RNA, and a PrimeScript
RT reagent kit (Takara) for Quantitative PCR (ABI 7500,
Foster City, CA, USA) was used to reverse-transcribe the
total RNA into cDNA with the supplement of a fluorescent
dye (SYBR Green I; Takara). The primers were as follows:

2.5. Western Blotting. Western blotting was carried out as
described previously [11]. A nuclear and cytoplasmic protein
extraction kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was used to prepare cytoplasmic and nuclear
proteins. Equal amounts of sample protein were separated
by sodium dodecyl sulfate- (SDS-) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) before blotting onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with antiCRT antibody (1 : 1000, Abcam, ab22683) at 4‚àò C overnight.
The protein was detected using horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies
and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection
reagents (Bioworld, Nanjing, China). The intensity of blots
was quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
2.6. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP). For co-IP, 500 ùúáL PBS
with protease inhibitor (1 : 100, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) was used to dilute 500 ùúág protein. The solution was preincubated with anti-CRT antibody (12.5 ùúág/mL,
Abcam, ab22683) or anti-Fas antibody (1 ùúág/mL, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., sc-21730, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 4‚àò C
overnight on a rotating shaker. Additional rotation for 2 h
was continued after addition of 20 ùúáL protein A/G-Sepharose
bead slurry (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to the mixture.
Ice-cold cell lysis buffer was used to wash the slurry three
times. Proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and
boiled for 5 min. Supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE
and Western blotting using anti-FasL antibody (1 : 200, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., sc-834).
2.7. Immunofluorescence. At 3 h after reperfusion, the SHSY5Y cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min
at room temperature and then seeded on cover slips.
Monoclonal rabbit anti-CRT antibody (1 : 500, Bioss, bs5913R, Beijing, China) and monoclonal mouse anti-FasL
antibody (1 : 200, Abcam, ab81196) were applied to the cells
at 4‚àò C overnight. Then they were incubated with secondary antibody (1 : 200, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
for 45 min at room temperature. The nuclei of the cells
were stained using a DAPI kit (KeyGen Biotech, Nanjing,
China). Fluorescent images were taken by immunofluorescent microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and laser scanning
confocal microscopy (Olympus).
2.8. MTT and Caspase-8 and Caspase-3 Activity Assays.
The viability of OGD SH-SY5Y cells was assessed using
the conventional MTT assay as previously described [12].
The caspase-8 and caspase-3 activities of OGD-exposed SHSY5Y cells were assessed using caspase activity assay kits

BioMed Research International
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China) according to
the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol.
2.9. Apoptosis Assay by Flow Cytometry. Apoptosis among
OGD-exposed cells was assessed using an Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit (KeyGen Biotech, China). Cells (1 √ó
106 /mL) were rinsed twice with PBS and then resuspended
in binding buffer containing 5 ùúáL Annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC) and 5 ùúáL propidium iodide (PI). After
incubation at room temperature in the dark for 15 min, the
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS Cantoll, Becton
Dickinson and Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) using Diva
software.
2.10. Statistical Analysis. All data are expressed as mean ¬±
standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences between two
groups were determined by independent samples ùë°-tests. All
statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Product
and Service Solutions 19.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). A difference was considered statistically significant at
ùëÉ < 0.05.

3. Results
3.1. Increase in CRT Expression in the Cortexes of MCAO Mice
at 3 h after Reperfusion, Earlier Than the Increase in Caspase8 and Caspase-3 mRNA Expression. To investigate whether
and when CRT expression was increased in the cortexes of
MCAO mice, real-time PCR and Western blotting were used
to detect the mRNA and protein levels of CRT, respectively.
Real-time PCR showed that CRT mRNA expression was
significantly increased at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after reperfusion,
quickly reaching a peak at 3 h after reperfusion and remaining
at high levels for the next 21 hours (200.0 ¬± 15.63% at 3 h,
176.4 ¬± 8.88% at 6 h, 142.7 ¬± 13.66% at 12 h, and 136.8 ¬±
14.74% at 24 h) (Figure 1(a)). In line with the RT-PCR
results, Western blotting showed high CRT levels from 3 h
to 24 h after reperfusion with expression at 3 h being the
highest (Figures 1(b1) and 1(b2)). We also used RT-PCR to
explore when the expression of caspase-8 and caspase-3 was
elevated. The increase in caspase-8 mRNA expression became
significant 6 h after reperfusion and reached peak levels at
24 h (194.5 ¬± 18.85% at 6 h, 317.5 ¬± 34.41% at 12 h, and
353.4 ¬± 39.29% at 24 h, Figure 1(c)). Similarly, a significant
increase in caspase-3 mRNA was detected 12 h and 24 h after
reperfusion (193.8¬±26.42% at 12 h and 302.2¬±28.18% at 24 h,
Figure 1(d)).
3.2. CRT Binds to FasL on the Neuronal Cell Surface after
Ischemia. To examine the expression of CRT and its location
in the cortex of ischemic mice, immunofluorescence was
used to stain brain slices from sham and MCAO mice. Little
CRT was detected in the cortexes of sham mice, whereas a
large amount was detected in those mice subjected to MCAO
and killed at 3 h after reperfusion. FasL was detected in
the brain of both sham and MCAO mice (Figure 2(a)). To
further validate whether CRT was expressed on the neuronal
cell surface, laser scanning confocal microscope was used to

3
detect the quantity and location of CRT in OGD-exposed SHSY5Y cells. CRT was barely visible in normal SH-SY5Y cells
but became obvious in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane
of the OGD-exposed SH-SY5Y cells 3 h after reperfusion
and colocalized on the cell surface with FasL (Figure 2(b)).
To verify that CRT can bind to FasL, protein was extracted
from the cortexes of sham mice and 3 h-MCAO mice. CoIP was performed, and the results demonstrated that the
two proteins can interact with each other in both groups;
however, more protein complexes were observed in MCAO
mice (Figures 2(c1) and 2(c2)). To confirm that CRT could
compete with Fas and prohibit Fas/FasL combination, protein
was extracted from SH-SY5Y cells and co-IP was performed.
It was found that little Fas formed a complex with FasL in
normal SH-SY5Y cells; however, increased interaction was
detected in OGD-exposed SH-SY5Y cells cultured without
CRT at 3 h after reperfusion. In contrast, with the presence of
40 ng/mL CRT, the amount of Fas/FasL was remarkably lower
(Figures 2(d1) and 2(d2)).
3.3. CRT Protected OGD-Exposed SH-SY5Y Cells. To evaluate
the ability of CRT to protect neurons during IRI, the SHSY5Y cells were moved to medium containing different
concentrations of CRT immediately after OGD. The MTT
assay was applied to evaluate cell viability at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h
after reperfusion. CRT at concentrations of 20‚Äì320 ng/mL
increased the viability of OGD-exposed SH-SY5Y cells at 6 h
after reperfusion from 40% (untreated control) to approximately 60% (Figure 3(a)). Thus, 40 ng/mL was used for
subsequent experiments. The protective effects were obvious
at 6 h after reperfusion and diminished with time (ùëÉ = 0.0014
at 6 h, ùëÉ = 0.0051 at 12 h, and ùëÉ = 0.0393 at 24 h, Figure 3(b)).
3.4. CRT Protects OGD-Exposed SH-SY5Y Cells from Apoptosis and Downregulates the Activity of Caspase-8 and Caspase3. To determine whether CRT can protect neurons from
apoptosis during ischemia, flow cytometry was used to detect
the apoptosis rate and caspase activity assay kits were used
to determine the activities of caspase-8 and caspase-3 at
3, 6, 12, and 24 h after reperfusion. The apoptosis rate of
control SH-SY5Y cells was similar after 12 h in culture with
or without 40 ng/mL CRT (untreated: 3.47 ¬± 0.26%, CRT
treated: 3.46 ¬± 0.24%, ùëÉ = 0.9778). However, in OGDexposed SH-SY5Y cells, the apoptosis rate was significantly
lower when the cells were treated with 40 ng/mL CRT for
12 h after reperfusion (untreated: 19.66 ¬± 1.06%, CRT treated:
14.24 ¬± 1.18%, ùëÉ = 0.0030; Figures 4(a1) and 4(a2)).
Compared with cells cultured without CRT, OGD-exposed
SH-SY5Y cells cultured in the presence of 40 ng/mL CRT
showed significantly less caspase-8 activity at 6 h (untreated:
198.6 ¬± 18.1%, CRT treated: 131.6 ¬± 17.2%, ùëÉ = 0.0153) and
12 h after reperfusion (untreated: 268.1 ¬± 30.1%, CRT treated:
185.1 ¬± 23.9%, ùëÉ = 0.0443). Similarly, reduced caspase-3
activity was also observed in OGD-exposed SH-SY5Y cells
treated with 40 ng/mL CRT at 12 h (untreated: 187.2 ¬± 17.5%,
CRT treated: 121.6 ¬± 15.7%, ùëÉ = 0.0121) and 24 h after
reperfusion (untreated: 215.3 ¬± 22.5%, CRT treated: 151.4 ¬±
18.5%, ùëÉ = 0.0418; Figure 4(c)).

4. Discussion
This study revealed, for the first time, that CRT is upregulated
during the early stage of ischemia and may interact with
FasL to inhibit neuronal apoptosis. We first showed that
the expression of CRT on the neuron surface was increased
after IRI. As an ER chaperone protein, CRT normally resides
in the ER and is increasingly expressed during ER stress,
which is one of the early pathological processes in ischemic
stroke. CRT barely can be detected in normal SH-SY5Y cells.
However, higher levels of CRT protein and mRNA were
detected in the cortexes of MCAO mice compared with mice
in the sham group. As a result of ER stress, highly expressed

CRT can be transferred to the plasma membrane [4] and has
been demonstrated to be involved in multiple extracellular
functions, such as cell attachment, immune thrombosis, and
angiogenesis [13, 14].
In this study, we found that one of the major consequences following upregulated CRT expression on the cell
surface could be the interruption to the formation of Fas/FasL
complex due to competitive binding of CRT with FasL. The
binding of CRT to FasL was verified in this study. A previous
study showed that, on the T-cell surface, CRT can bind to
FasL [7] and inhibit Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis of T cells in
the joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [8]. FASL has
been reported to be expressed by both neurons and neuroglia

[15]. It exists in two forms: a 37-kDa membrane-bound FasL
(mFasL) and a 30-kDa soluble FasL (sFasL) [16]. sFasL is a
cleaved and soluble form of FasL released from activated cells
and is traditionally considered as a cytokine that can induce
apoptosis in susceptible cells [16]. We found that, during IRI,
CRT was transferred to the neuronal surface and colocalized
with FasL. Furthermore, co-IP confirmed that CRT could
bind to the 30-kDa sFasL. It is quite possible that upregulated
CRT on the neuronal cell surface can bind to sFasL during IRI

and, therefore, prevents sFasL from activating the Fas/FasL
pathway and triggering neuronal apoptosis.
It has been shown that increased surface expression of
CRT is correlated with apoptosis rate. A study by Tarr et al.
showed that the spontaneous apoptosis rate of Jurkat cells
was about 8.5%, which is the same as the percentage of
CRT-positive cells. After treatment with FasL, 24% of the
Jurkat cells proceeded to undergo apoptosis, and CRT was
expressed on the surface of 44% of these Jurkat cells [4].

Our study showed that, in the cortexes of MCAO mice,
CRT mRNA expression was increased obviously at 3 h after
reperfusion, which is earlier than the timing of the increase
in mRNA expression of downstream signaling molecules of
Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis, that is, caspase-8 and caspase3. Furthermore, CRT was also visible on the neuronal surface
via immunohistofluorescent staining at 3 h after reperfusion,
in line with the results of Tarr‚Äôs study. The earlier increase
in CRT expression makes it possible for CRT to inhibit
Fas/FasL-mediated apoptosis. Our results showing that the
viability of OGD-exposed SH-SY5Y cells was increased by the
presence of CRT, most obviously at 6 h and 12 h after OGD,
validated that CRT is a potential neuron protector induced
soon after IRI. Our study also revealed that the high protein
and mRNA expression of CRT faded with time, whereas
the mRNA expression of caspase-8 and caspase-3 increased
gradually within the first 24 h after reperfusion, suggesting
that the protective effect of endogenous CRT may only exist
during the early stage of IRI.
A previous study by Duus et al. demonstrated the interaction of CRT and FasL and a subsequent conformational
change in FasL [7]. We hypothesize that such a change
may prohibit FasL from interacting with its receptor, Fas,
and, therefore, decrease the recruitment and activation of its
downstream effector proteins. It was observed in our study
that the apoptosis rate was lower in OGD-exposed SH-SY5Y
cells cultured with the presence of 40 ng/mL CRT than in
those cultured without CRT. Our study revealed that, in
normal SH-SY5Y cells, the activity of caspase-8, which is first
activated by Fas, was increased at 6 h after reperfusion and

maintained over the first 24 h. Then the activity of caspase-3,
the protein substrate of caspase-8 and inducer of apoptosis,
was elevated later than that of caspase-8. We also found that
the activities of both caspase-8 and caspase-3 were lower in
OGD-exposed SH-SY5Y cells cultured with 40 ng/mL CRT
than in those cultured without CRT, further demonstrating
the effect of CRT on impeding Fas/FasL-triggered apoptosis.
It is worth noting that Fas/FasL is not the only pathway
that mediates neuronal apoptosis after ischemic stroke. Many
other apoptosis signals, such as TRAIL, TNF-ùõº, and Bcl-2
[7, 17, 18], are also involved in neuronal apoptosis following
IRI. As a result, CRT only partially inhibited apoptosis in
OGD-exposed SH-SY5Y cells in our study.
FasL is involved in many mechanisms of neuronal injury
besides apoptosis, such as inflammation and immunity [8,
19]. Thus, the interaction of CRT with FasL may prevent
damage to neurons through some other pathways. The ER
and non-ER functions of CRT, such as calcium storage and
signaling, protein folding, and immunity regulation [13, 20],
may also contribute to its effect on neuronal protection.
Our study is limited because SH-SY5Y cells are a neuroblastoma cell line, which differs from normal human neuronal
cells in many aspects. For example, the high proliferative
capability of the cell line leads to greater cell viability
and a lower apoptosis rate after IRI compared to those in
primary neurons. Most of our experiments were done in
vitro, and more complicated in vivo experiments are needed
to further elucidate the interaction between CRT and FasL.
Nevertheless, our data do provide some insights into the
neuroprotective effect of CRT in ischemic stroke.

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, this study showed that, during the early stage of
ischemic stroke, CRT was quickly upregulated within hours,
transferred to the surface of neurons, and bound to FasL. This
led to inhibition of Fas/FasL-mediated neuronal apoptosis
and indicated the potential of CRT in neuron protection
following ischemic stroke.
