Recent human neuroimaging studies indicate that spontaneous ﬂuctuations in neural activity, as measured by
functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI), are signiﬁcantly affected following stroke.
Disrupted functional connectivity is associated with behavioral deﬁcits and has been linked to long-term recovery potential. FcMRI studies of stroke in rats have generally produced similar ﬁndings, although subacute cortical
reorganization following focal ischemia appears to be more rapid than in humans. Similar studies in mice have
not been published, most likely because fMRI in the small mouse brain is technically challenging. Extending functional connectivity methods to mouse models of stroke could provide a valuable tool for understanding the link
between molecular mechanisms of stroke repair and human fcMRI ﬁndings at the system level. We applied functional connectivity optical intrinsic signal imaging (fcOIS) to mice before and 72 h after transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (tMCAO) to examine how graded ischemic injury affects the relationship between functional
connectivity and infarct volume, stimulus-induced response, and behavior. Regional changes in functional connectivity within the MCA territory were largely proportional to infarct volume. However, subcortical damage affected functional connectivity in the somatosensory cortex as much as larger infarcts of cortex and subcortex. The
extent of injury correlated with cortical activations following electrical stimulation of the affected forelimb and
with functional connectivity in the somatosensory cortex. Regional homotopic functional connectivity in motor
cortex correlated with behavioral deﬁcits measured using an adhesive patch removal test. Spontaneous hemodynamic activity within the infarct exhibited altered temporal and spectral features in comparison to intact tissue;
failing to account for these regional differences signiﬁcantly affected apparent post-stroke functional connectivity
measures. Thus, several results were strongly dependent on how the resting-state data were processed. Speciﬁcally, global signal regression alone resulted in apparently distorted functional connectivity measures in the intact hemisphere. These distortions were corrected by regressing out multiple sources of variance, as performed
in human fcMRI. We conclude that fcOIS provides a sensitive imaging modality in the murine stroke model; however, it is necessary to properly account for altered hemodynamics in injured brain to obtain accurate measures of
functional connectivity.

Stroke is a major health concern in the United States, where it is the
fourth leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability
(Anon). Although tissue death from ischemic injury is often well localized, it is becoming increasingly clear that focal injuries affect distributed patterns of synchronized neural activity throughout the brain. Recent
studies using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance
imaging (fcMRI) have demonstrated that intra- and inter-hemispheric
connections are altered shortly after stroke in humans and predict performance in tasks related to the injury (Carter et al., 2010; Corbetta,
2010). In particular, disruption of functional connectivity between

A.Q. Bauer et al. / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 388–401

homotopic cortical regions appears to be a strong predictor of poor performance after injury in domains of both attention and motor tasks
(Carter et al., 2010, 2012; Corbetta, 2010; He et al., 2007), ﬁndings
which underscore studies reporting altered evoked responses in the
affected brain regions of stroke patients (Calautti and Baron, 2003;
Corbetta et al., 2005; Cramer and Bastings, 2000).
FcMRI studies of stroke in rats have generally produced similar
results to those in humans. Both stimulus-induced cortical responses
(Corbetta et al., 2005; Dijkhuizen et al., 2001, 2003) and functional connectivity (van Meer et al., 2010a) are reduced following focal ischemia,
and correlate with behavioral deﬁcits and subsequent recovery. However, interhemispheric homotopic connectivity and contralesional ipsilateral connectivity in somatosensory and motor regions in rats have been
reported to subacutely increase (van Meer et al., 2010a). These two latter results might suggest more rapid system level reorganization in rats
following focal ischemia than has been otherwise observed in humans
(Rehme et al., 2011) or at the cellular level in other animal models of
stroke recovery (Johnston et al., 2013; Mostany and Portera-Cailliau,
2011; Mostany et al., 2010).
Because the size of the mouse brain has presented a more signiﬁcant
challenge than rats for fcMRI, to date, there have not been analogous hemodynamic-based studies of functional connectivity in mice subjected
to ischemic injury. Establishing analogous functional imaging in both
mouse and humans is one of the most promising strategies to providing
clinical translation. It is important to extend functional connectivity
methods to mouse models of stroke so that molecular studies in mice
(Clarkson et al., 2010, 2011; Li and Carmichael, 2006; Lu, 2003) can be
related to human stroke fcMRI ﬁndings. To address this need, we have
developed functional connectivity optical intrinsic signal imaging
(fcOIS) in mouse models of healthy (White et al., 2011) and diseased
(Bero et al., 2012) brain. The observed functional connectivity patterns
are robust and reproducible across mice and reveal cross-species
homologies with humans (e.g. compare Fig. 3 in (White et al., 2011)
with Fig. 1 in (Zhang and Raichle, 2010)).
To establish fcOIS in the context of an acute ischemic stroke model,
we performed fcOIS before and 72 h after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Functional status of the mice was evaluated in a
manner akin to human stroke studies. Mice were separated into three
groups based on infarct size and location to determine if graded ischemic injury incrementally impacts the relationship between functional
connectivity and infarct volume, stimulus-related activations, and behavior. Determining how these relationships are affected after stroke
will provide a more complete understanding of acute system-level
damage, but in a model capable of facilitating targeted studies of stroke
recovery mechanisms using genetic and molecular approaches.
Because functional connectivity measures depend on a preprocessing strategy, as a secondary goal, we examined how alternative regression approaches affect observed functional connectivity measures.
These investigations indicated that global signal regression (GSR)
alone can lead to distorted functional connectivity measures, and that
multiple regression of nuisance variables is necessary to obtain accurate
results. Overall, we found that fcOIS is a useful tool for understanding
functional disruption in a mouse model of focal ischemia, and for bringing a robust and efﬁcient functional assay into mouse studies of stroke
recovery.
Methods
Animal preparation
Male ND4 Swiss Webster mice, aged to 6–10 weeks (22–32 g), were
used for experimentation. Mice were given ad libitum access to food and
water. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Studies
Committee at Washington University.
In accord with our previously published animal preparation protocol
for fcOIS imaging (White et al., 2011), anesthesia was initiated via i.p.

389

injection with a bolus of ketamine-xylazine (1× dose: 86.9 mg/kg ketamine, 13.4 mg/kg xylazine) and animals were allowed 15 min for anesthetic transition. After induction, the animal was placed on a heating
pad maintained at 37 °C via feedback from a rectal probe (mTCII, Cell
Microcontrols) and its head was secured in a stereotactic frame. The
head was shaved and cleaned, a midline incision was made along the
top of the head to reﬂect the scalp and the skull was kept intact. To facilitate longer imaging times, after the initial bolus, mice were infused
(i.p.) with a saline-ketamine cocktail (34.8 mg/kg/h ketamine) during
the imaging sessions.
Imaging system
Sequential illumination was provided at four wavelengths by a ring
of light emitting diodes (LEDs) placed approximately 10 cm above the
mouse's head. Our ﬁeld of view included most of the cerebral cortex
(approximately 1 cm2). Diffuse reﬂected light was detected by a cooled,
frame-transfer EMCCD camera (iXon 897, Andor Technologies); the LED
ring and the camera were time-synchronized and controlled via a computer using custom-written software (MATLAB, Mathworks) at a full
frame rate of 30 Hz.
Imaging
Mice were imaged 7–14 days prior to and 3 days after tMCAO. Thirty
minutes of activation data (15 min each paw, 18 stimulus presentations
per paw) and up to 45 min of resting state data were collected for each
mouse in 5 minute data sets (75 min of data total per mouse). The skull
was kept moist with mineral oil during imaging.
Forepaw stimulation
Needle electrodes were inserted into the dorsal and ventral sides of
the left and right forepaws between digits 2 and 3. The stimulation paradigm consisted of 5 s of rest, followed by a 10 second stimulus train,
then 35 s of rest administered in a block design. Electrical stimuli were
0.3 ms pulses delivered at 3 Hz at an amplitude of 1.5 mA driven by a
constant current stimulus isolation unit (World Precision Instruments).
Fifteen minutes of data was collected for each paw (18 trials per paw
total).
Image processing
Data from all mice were subject to an initial quality check prior to
spectroscopic analysis. Data runs (5 min) in which reﬂected light level
intensity (mean value over the brain) varied as a function of time by
greater than 1% for any wavelength were excluded from further analysis. This preliminary quality control yielded 45–75 min of data per
mouse. For subsequent analysis, image light intensity at each wavelength was interpreted using the Modiﬁed Beer–Lambert Law, usually
expressed as: Φ(r,t) = Φ0 × exp(− Δμa(r,t) × L). Here, Φ(r,t) is the
measured light intensity, Φ0 is the baseline light intensity, Δμa(r, t) is
the change in absorption coefﬁcient due to hemodynamic changes,
and L is the optical path length factor for photons in the tissue
(Arridge et al., 1992). As there is no pre-stimulus baseline in restingstate experimentation, we normalized relative to the average light intensity at each pixel, resulting in differential measures of absorption at
each wavelength at each pixel: Δμa,λ(r,t) = −ln(Φλ(r,t)/bΦ0λ(r,t)N)/Lλ.
Absorption coefﬁcient data were converted to hemoglobin (Hb) concentration changes by inverting the system of equations, Δμa,λ (r,t) =
Eλ,i Δ[Hbi](r,t) (where E is the extinction coefﬁcient matrix (Prahl,
2002), and i runs over hemoglobin species). This inversion was
performed using least-squares methods, yielding changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbR) at
each pixel at each time point. Differential changes in hemoglobin concentration were ﬁltered to retain the functional connectivity band

(A) group 1: mice with only subcortical infarcts (N = 14, infarct volume ranging from 7.3 mm3 to 54.3 mm3); group 2: mice with infarcts involving subcortex and small lateral portions of cortex (N = 20, infarct volume
ranging from 32.9 mm3 to 71.6 mm3); and group 3: mice with infarcts involving subcortex and large portions of cortex (N = 12, infarct volume ranging from 90 mm3 to 169.3 mm3).

(0.009–0.08 Hz) following previous human functional connectivity
algorithms (Fox et al., 2005). After ﬁltering, each pixel's time series
was downsampled from 30 Hz to 1 Hz, and all further analysis was
performed only on those pixels labeled as brain using a manuallyconstructed brain mask. Temporal frequency power spectra were
calculated by a fast Fourier transform (FFT). Image sequences during
forepaw stimulation trials were coregistered and averaged over the
18, 50-second blocks presented to each paw. For all mice, responses
from 13 to 15 s (corresponding to peak response in the Control group)
were averaged to obtain activation maps for each paw. To account for
inter-mouse variability in response amplitude and location, maps for
each mouse were normalized by the amplitude at the coordinate corresponding to peak response in the control group divided by the peak response in a 20 × 20 pixel region (~ 2.4 mm2 area) around that
coordinate. All analyses were performed using HbO unless otherwise
stated.
Image coregistration
Image sequences of each mouse (as well as the brain mask for each
mouse) were afﬁne-transformed to a common atlas space determined
by the positions of the junction between the coronal suture and sagittal
suture (posterior to the olfactory bulb and cerebrum along midline) and
lambda (Franklin and Paxinos, 2008). Bregma was not visible in all mice,

and was calculated based on the above two anatomical landmarks. The
anterior–posterior stretch was set equal to the medial–lateral stretch,
and all transformed images were centered at bregma. The intersection
of every brain mask was calculated and made symmetric by reﬂection
across the midline allowing all subsequent comparisons to be performed
on shared brain areas across all mice. Brain slices were reassembled and
aligned after TTC staining and registered with image sequence data using
bregma and lambda. The infarct was segmented from the rest of the
brain using the contrast provided by TTC staining of ischemic and nonischemic brain tissue.
Signal regression
Signal regression is a common method used to remove sources of variance from a given voxel's time series (Aguirre et al., 1998; Desjardins
et al., 2001; Macey et al., 2004; Murphy et al., 2009). For a particular
voxel, i, the time series detected Si(t) (in this case the pixel-wise OIS
data) can be written as
Si ðt Þ ¼ g ðt Þ  βi þ xi ðt Þ

ð1Þ

where g(t) is a regressor, βi is the regression coefﬁcient, and xi(t) is the
signal within the ith pixel after regression. For control mice and those
with subcortical infarcts (Group 1), global signal regression (GSR) was

A.Q. Bauer et al. / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 388–401

used. Time traces of all pixels deﬁned as brain were averaged to create a
global brain signal, gGSR(t) and regressed from every pixel labeled as
brain, where

and N is the number of all brain pixels (N ~ 10,000). For mice with cortical
and subcortical infarcts (Groups 2 and 3) we used a multiple signal
regression (MSR) approach where the time traces of all pixels within
the infarct and those outside of the infarct were averaged separately to
create two separate regressors,

suture was directly conﬁrmed by inspection via an operating microscope and more distally by laser Doppler. After the procedure, animals
recovered in an incubator before being transferred to their home cages.
Histology and group designations
After the ﬁnal imaging session, brains were sectioned and stained
with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) to assist in characterizing the infarcts. After all mice were imaged, infarct volumes were
ranked from smallest to largest. All statistical regression analysis was
performed across all of the mice allowing infarct volume to vary continuously. For group analysis, the mice were classiﬁed into 3 groups
post-hoc based on infarct location and infarct volume—group 1: mice
with only subcortical infarcts (N = 14, infarct volume ranging from
7.3 mm3 to 54.3 mm3); group 2: mice with infarcts involving subcortex
and small lateral portions of cortex (N = 20, infarct volume ranging
from 32.9 mm3 to 71.6 mm3); and group 3: mice with infarcts involving
subcortex and large portions of cortex (N = 12, infarct volume ranging
from 90 mm3 to 169.3 mm3).

MATLAB, and values were accepted as signiﬁcant if p b 0.05.
Results

Functional connectivity measures
To investigate the strength of network connections, 10 seed locations were positioned at coordinates expected to correspond to the
left and right olfactory, motor, somatosensory, retrosplenial, and visual
cortices using a histological atlas (Franklin and Paxinos, 2008) as
described previously (Bero et al., 2012; White et al., 2011). Seed timetraces were calculated by averaging the time traces within 0.25 mm of
a seed locus (containing approximately 30 pixels). Functional connectivity analysis was performed by correlating these time courses against
the time course of every pixel in the brain, producing 10 functional connectivity maps over the mouse brain. In addition, a 10 × 10 seed-to-seed
correlation matrix was computed by correlating each of the 10 seed
time traces. To further examine homotopic functional connectivity
across the entire brain, three 5-minute data runs from each mouse
were selected at random, concatenated, and every pixel in the mouse
brain was used as a seed. Each pixel's time trace was correlated with
its contralateral homologue, resulting in a homotopic functional connectivity map for each mouse. Functional connectivity maps were averaged within each group to obtain group-level results.
Adhesive tape removal test
A small square piece of adhesive tape (an Avery® label cut to
0.3 cm × 0.3 cm) was placed over the ventral hairless region of the
right and left forepaws, and the time taken to remove the tape was measured for each forelimb with a maximum allowed time of 120 s per trial.
Five days before the ﬁrst imaging session all mice were trained to remove adhesive patches from the right and lefts paws within 5 s; reported post-stroke times are the average adhesive removal times at 48 and
72 h after tMCAO. All imaging was performed after behavioral tests.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)
tMCAO was performed using a nylon suture coated with silicone for
60 or 90 min, as described (Miller et al., 2001). Restoration of blood ﬂow

To provide a basis for examining the interaction between functional
connectivity deﬁcits, ischemic injury, stimulus-induced responses, and
behavior, the mouse data were separated into three groups according
to infarct size and location. Group 1 had only subcortical infarcts
(N = 14); group 2 had moderate infarcts involving lateral/ventral cortex and subcortex (N = 20); and group 3 had large infarcts involving
substantial portions of both the cortex and subcortex (N = 12)
(Fig. 1A). Infarct volumes were statistically different for all group comparisons (Fig. 1B), and were estimated by analysis of brain slices stained
with TTC (Fig. 1C: representative slices; Fig. 1D: reorganized slices to
show representative infarcts within our ﬁeld-of-view). The functional
connectivity analyses examined brain regions within the MCA territory
(motor, somatosensory, and visual), perilesional cortex (retrosplenial),
and a control region (olfactory) as determined by their atlas designations (Fig. 1D).
The effect of ischemic injury on functional connectivity
Resting-state functional connectivity was evaluated as the Pearson
correlation between a seed and other cortical locations. Correlations
were calculated for each mouse and then averaged in mouse atlas
space within each group (controls and infarct groups 1–3) for both
pre- and post-stroke analyses. Prior to tMCAO, all of the mice revealed
distinct, symmetric resting-state functional connectivity for each of
the investigated seeds (Figs. 2, 3 control, top row). The pre-stroke
maps exhibited symmetric patterns with positive correlations between
adjacent cortex and functionally-related regions (e.g., motor and somatosensory cortex) and anti-correlations (negative r, blue), between
functionally-opposed regions (e.g., somatosensory and retrosplenial
cortices). Graded disruption of interhemispheric functional connectivity
was observed primarily within the MCA territory (somatosensory,
motor, visual cortices), depending on infarct volume for seeds placed
in either hemisphere. Substantial change in functional connectivity in
perilesional (retrosplenial) cortex was observed in groups 2 and 3. Moderate disruption in distant (olfactory) regions was also observed in

Note that connectivity patterns of regions within the MCA territory (motor, somatosensory, visual) are more affected than perilesional regions (retrosplenial) and those far from the insult (olfactory).

group 3. Interestingly, seeds placed in the right (contralateral) hemisphere (Fig. 2) showed very little change in local, intrahemispheric
functional connectivity as a function of injury. In contrast, many of the
seeds placed in the left (ipsilesional) hemisphere (Fig. 3) show graded
decline in intrahemispheric functional connectivity with the most notable changes occurring in somatosensory and visual cortices. In general,
functional connectivity maps calculated for HbR (Fig. S1) and total
hemoglobin (Fig. S2) exhibited similar trends as those calculated
using oxygenated hemoglobin and were not further analyzed.
Connections between homotopic regions appear to be those most
affected by ischemia, and decline in homotopic functional connectivity
is strongly correlated with behavioral deﬁcits and recovery (Carter
et al., 2010, 2012; van Meer et al., 2010a). To examine the topography
of this measure in the mouse, every pixel within our ﬁeld of view was
used as a seed center and its time trace was correlated with its contralateral homolog, producing a brain-wide map of homotopic functional
connectivity within each cohort (Fig. 4). (Because a map of homotopic
functional connectivity is necessarily symmetric about midline, we
chose to visualize this measure in the ipsilesional hemisphere to illustrate how reductions in homotopic connectivity are spatially related to
the functional domains perfused by the left MCA.) After tMCAO, functional connectivity in group 1 was dramatically reduced in the somatosensory cortex and other lateral regions; decline in surrounding cortical
areas becomes more apparent with larger infarcts. Thus, the spatial extent of reduced homotopic functional connectivity increased in proportion to infarct severity. In the most affected group, this measure trended
towards zero (no correlation) over the entire ﬁeld of view, indicating

that the temporal synchrony between homotopic brain regions is globally affected by ischemia.
Quantitative relations between functional connectivity and lesion size
Fig. 5 reports functional connectivity in relation to infarct size for
mice following tMCAO. As suggested by the qualitative post-stroke results (Figs. 2–4), infarct size correlated most strongly with functional
connectivity reductions in the motor and retrosplenial cortices. In contrast, infarcts of all sizes had similarly strong effects on homotopic functional connectivity in the somatosensory and visual regions. Ipsilesional
somatomotor functional connectivity, calculated by correlating time
traces from the left somatosensory cortex with those from left motor
cortex, was also invariant to injury (Fig. 5B, left somatomotor). Finally,
homotopic functional connectivity in the olfactory region was preserved in mice with small stroke volumes and only minimally declined
with increasing stroke volume (these effects are further illustrated in
Fig. 9, which also includes control mice, see below).
Stimulus induced responses are incrementally affected by stroke severity
OIS imaging was used to map stimulus-induced responses to electrical forepaw stimulation before and after tMCAO in a subset of mice
(control: N = 16; group1: N = 12; group 2: N = 10; group 3: N = 6).
Responses to forepaw stimulation in control mice (Fig. 6, control)
were well localized to the somatosensory cortex, as deﬁned by our
atlas (Fig. 1D). Following stroke, responses to contralesional (right)

limb stimulation declined signiﬁcantly in the left hemisphere with increasing infarct severity (Fig. 6 bottom row, Fig. S3), and strongly correlated with functional connectivity decline in the somatosensory cortex
(Fig. S4). Responses in the affected hemisphere in group 3 had poorer
signal to noise, and did not statistically differ from zero. While electrical
stimulation of the unaffected (left) limb appears to produce a stereotypical response in all groups qualitatively similar to that as observed in the
controls (Fig. 6, top row), we did observe very weak correlation
between response magnitude in the unaffected (right) hemisphere

Sensorimotor function was assessed in 23 mice using an adhesive removal test before and after focal ischemia (15 mice in the control group;

Fig. 5. Functional connectivity vs. degree of injury. Post-stroke homotopic functional connectivity correlated strongly with infarct volume in motor and retrosplenial cortices. Homotopic
functional connectivity in somatosensory and visual regions, and left intrahemispheric somatomotor functional connectivity was much more uniformly depressed in mice with infarcts of
all sizes. Homotopic functional connectivity in olfactory cortex was nearly unaffected by infarcts and maintained values similar to those in pre-stroke mice. Functional connectivity values
are Fisher z-transformed Pearson correlations. Control mice are not included in this ﬁgure. See Fig. 9A for comparison of infarcted mice vs. controls.

remove adhesive tape from the left and right forepaws within 5 s, and
then were retested 48 and 72 h after stroke. Removal times for the affected limb after stroke (Fig. 7A) signiﬁcantly increased in each group
compared to controls. A subset of those mice tested were imaged pre
and post stroke and had their removal times evaluated against functional connectivity pre and post ischemia (6 mice in the control group; 3
mice in group 1, 7 mice in group 2, and 2 mice in group 3). Mice with
removal times longer than 120 s were not included (i.e., 3 mice from
group 2 and 1 mouse from group 3 were removed from this analysis).
Strong correlation was found between removal times for the
contralesional limb and homotopic functional connectivity (Fig. 7B) in
the motor region. Interestingly, a strong correlation was also found between affected limb removal times and homotopic functional

connectivity in the retrosplenial cortex, a brain region not typically associated with this behavioral task.
Spectral and temporal features of injured and healthy hemisphere signals
Ischemic stroke produces focal lesions that alter regional spontaneous activity. An initial examination of resting-state hemodynamics compared the average time traces of infarct and non-infarct regions in
groups 2 and 3 mice (Fig. 8A); distinct temporal and spectral features
were found over the functional connectivity band. For example, time
traces within the infarct region (Fig. 8B, red trace) exhibit a “low-passﬁltering” characteristic compared with the non-infarcted tissue
(Fig. 8B, black trace). Average power in frequencies above 0.03 Hz in

the group 3 mice (Fig. 8C, red trace) was signiﬁcantly lower in damaged
tissue when compared to non-infarcted regions. Cross-correlation analysis of left and right homotopic regions within each group revealed peak
time shifts ranging from 0 to − 3.5 s across groups (Fig. 8D). Here,
negative time shifts correspond to left hemisphere delay and motivated
the implementation of the MSR analysis. In the following section, we
show that failing to separately account for shared variance within the
healthy and injured tissue signiﬁcantly affects quantitative estimates
of functional connectivity.
Multiple nuisance signal regression versus global signal regression
Homotopic functional connectivity was quantiﬁed using both MSR
(Fig. 9A) and GSR (Fig. 9B). Results from both methods reveal altered
functional connectivity following stroke. However, GSR produced
homotopic anti-correlations with much of the lesioned hemisphere,
including homotopic motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices in
mice of groups 2 and 3 (Figs. 9B, 10, S5). In contrast, following MSR,
these correlations approached zero (e.g. Fig. 9A, motor; Figs. 10, S5)
for seeds placed in either hemisphere. Additionally, following MSR,
intrahemispheric functional connectivity contralateral to the infarct
between right motor cortex and right somatosensory cortex was preserved across all three groups (Fig. 9A, right somatomotor) and was
not signiﬁcantly dependent on infarct size (not shown). In contrast, correlations within either hemisphere incrementally increased with stroke
severity following GSR (e.g. Fig. 9B, right and left somatomotor, and
Figs. 10, S5).
Discussion
In this study, we used novel functional neuroimaging, fcOIS, and
graded degrees of ischemia in mice to evaluate the relationships
between functional connectivity and infarct size, cortical responses to
forepaw stimulation, and behavior. Establishing the degree of functional
disruption in a mouse model of ischemia will enable further studies
aimed at understanding network damage and repair in the context of
human stroke where infarct size and location vary widely. Because the
mouse brain exhibits many of the resting-state networks observed in
humans, the mouse model provides a platform on which to study

molecular mechanisms of repair (Carmichael, 2008; Carmichael et al.,
2001; Clarkson et al., 2010, 2011).
Effects of stroke on functional connectivity
Control mice (ND4 Swiss Webster) exhibit strong, brain-wide correlation between homotopic regions (Fig. 4, Control) similar to other
wild-type (B6C3) mice that have previously been imaged (Bero et al.,
2012). Regional differences in homotopic functional connectivity are
apparent; motor and retrosplenial cortices exhibit higher correlation
than, for example, somatosensory cortices. These regional inhomogeneities suggest an inherent difference in the temporal coherence of
spontaneous activity within and across different brain networks of the
mouse brain. Overall, following tMCAO, functional connectivity between homotopic regions declined towards zero with increasing infarct
severity. Signiﬁcant disruption in functional connectivity was observed
in motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices in all three groups, and in
the retrosplenial cortex for moderate and large infarcts (Figs. 2–5, 9A).
In motor and retrosplenial cortices, we see a signiﬁcant correlation between functional connectivity and infarct volume (Fig. 5) and adhesive
removal time and functional connectivity (Fig. 7). These data illustrate
the speciﬁcity of correlation between functional connectivity and infarct
volumes and behavior within speciﬁc brain regions (representing different networks). Lesion size correlated most strongly with the degree
of functional connectivity disruption in motor cortical regions (Fig. 5).
A different picture was found in the olfactory, somatosensory, and visual
regions. Functional connectivity in the olfactory region remained high,
near control values in all infarcted mice. Subcortical infarcts resulting
from MCAO affected homotopic functional connectivity in somatosensory and visual cortices to a much greater extent than other cortical regions (e.g. motor). The dorsal branch of the MCA in the mouse directly
perfuses tissue within the somatosensory cortex, whereas both the
MCA and the anterior carotid artery (ACA) supply blood to motor cortex
(Maeda et al., 1999). During an MCA occlusion, the ACA might provide
some, though insufﬁcient, collateral ﬂow to motor cortex while the somatosensory cortex remains largely ischemic. The impaired reperfusion
to motor cortex might explain why local ipsilesional connectivity
around the motor seed was relatively preserved across groups while
somatomotor connectivity in the ipsilesional hemisphere was not.

Fig. 10. Measured functional connectivity following ischemic stroke depends on regression method (seeds in affected hemisphere). Functional connectivity patterns for seeds (black circles) in left (affected) hemisphere show graded decline in inter- and intra-hemispheric functional connectivity using multiple signal regression (MSR). Global signal regression (GSR) results in the largest changes in connectivity, with contralateral regions becoming increasingly anticorrelated in groups 2 and 3. This increased connectivity (both positive and negative
correlations) following GSR is a result of the temporal delay between infarct and non-infarct tissue and is an artifact. Note with MSR that correlations with dead tissue (seed in left somatosensory cortex) approach zero as one might expect.

in the ipsilesional hemisphere was signiﬁcantly reduced in all mice with
infarcts of any size; however, intrahemispheric functional connectivity
between right motor and right somatosensory cortex did not show a statistically signiﬁcant decline for any infarct size (Fig. 9). This result, which
has not been observed in the rat, provides additional support for the implementation of an MSR approach to calculating functional connectivity
post ischemia.
Stroke affects spontaneous and stimulus-induced activity
Following tMCAO, resting state signals within the infarct and noninfarct tissue revealed different temporal and spectral characteristics
(Fig. 8B, C). Spontaneous hemodynamic ﬂuctuations within the infarct
exhibited signiﬁcant attenuation over most of the functional connectivity
band while the remaining components displayed delayed correlations
with contralateral brain regions. These observations are consistent with
several other studies reporting alterations in neurovascular coupling
following stroke (Girouard and Iadecola, 2006) in animals and humans
where focal ischemia produced regional changes in basal perfusion
(Ayata et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2008; Sutherland et al., 2011) and
cerebrovascular reactivity (Krainik et al., 2005) within lesional and
perilesional tissue. Such physiological effects do not exclude the possibility that viable neuronal tissue may still be present within the ischemic
core and surrounding regions. Two recent fcMRI studies have analyzed
the temporal shift between all brain voxels and the global signal in a

manner similar to the cross correlation analysis between homotopic regions reported herein (Amemiya et al., 2013; Lv et al., 2013). In these
studies, the authors found that in non-hemorrhagic, post stroke patients,
a delay in time-to-peak correlation with the global signal was observed
in subjects with chronic hypoperfusion (Amemiya et al., 2013; Lv et al.,
2013) and without neurologic impairment (Lv et al., 2013). That is, a
temporal delay in spontaneous activity corresponds to a vascular, but
not necessarily a neuronal, deﬁcit. Hypoperfused regions may still contain viable neuronal networks, but quantitative comparisons between
temporal delay, functional connectivity changes, and tissue viability are
beyond the scope of this manuscript (animals in the current study
were imaged following complete reperfusion as determined by laser
Doppler). We suggest that such studies would be better informed using
multiple signal regression techniques, as presently described.
Reduced stimulus-induced responses in the somatosensory cortex
within the ipsilesional hemisphere (Fig. 6) agree with similar previously
published studies of responses to forelimb stimulation in mice (Brown
et al., 2009) and rats (Dijkhuizen et al., 2003, 2012). Additionally,
decreases in the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in
humans have been observed in lesioned somatomotor regions, and impaired cerebrovascular reactivity has predicted weakened motorrelated BOLD responses to contralateral movements (Krainik et al.,
2005). We found that the cortical responses in the affected limb correlated signiﬁcantly with functional connectivity decline in the somatosensory cortex, in good agreement with several studies in rats and

A.Q. Bauer et al. / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 388–401

humans following stroke (Carter et al., 2010, 2012; Corbetta, 2010;
Corbetta et al., 2005; Dijkhuizen et al., 2001, 2003; He et al., 2007; van
Meer et al., 2010a).
Disrupted functional connectivity as a behavioral correlate
Behavioral recovery has been associated with alterations in
perilesional cortex excitability (Clarkson et al., 2010), changes in local
connectivity (Dancause et al., 2005), and ultimately, cortical remapping
(Brown et al., 2009; Jones and Schallert, 1992). Ischemic injury has been
shown to also affect neuronal connections more broadly at the network
level—damage to one node can cause functional anomalies in distant
nodes of the network, even those appearing anatomically normal. Recent fcMRI studies have shown that resting state networks are altered
shortly after stroke in humans and predict performance in tasks related
to the injury (Corbetta, 2010; Corbetta et al., 2005; He et al., 2007). In
particular, the disruption of interhemispheric homotopic functional
connectivity has been shown to be predictive of poor behavioral recovery (Carter et al., 2012; He et al., 2007). Post stroke, we found that that
subcortical lesions restricted to the white matter tracts and the striatum
impaired somatosensory functional connectivity to the same extent as
larger cortical infarcts (e.g., Figs. 2–5, 9A). Thus, somewhat surprisingly,
we found that functional connectivity in the somatosensory cortex, one
of the brain regions typically associated with this somatomotor test of
asymmetry, was not predictive of post stroke removal times (R2 =
0.10, p = 0.19, Fig. 7), even though the responses to forepaw stimulation did show a graded deﬁcit that correlated with infarct volume
(Fig. S3) and homologous functional connectivity (Fig. S4). Interestingly, motor and retrosplenial cortices were the only two regions where
functional connectivity signiﬁcantly correlated with adhesive removal
time in the affected limb (Fig. 7B). While correlation between removal
times and motor functional connectivity might be expected (mice
remove the patches by bringing their forepaws to their mouths and
pulling them off with their teeth), the correlation of this behavioral
task with functional connectivity in the retrosplenial cortex was not
anticipated. One plausible explanation for this ﬁnding is that the mice
must learn how to perform this task, a process that involves retrosplenial
cortex for working memory and retrieval (Corcoran et al., 2011; Vann
et al., 2009). A lesion of this region could disrupt normal memory pathways, potentially causing the mouse to forget how to remove the
adhesive.
The effect of regression strategy on functional connectivity measures
GSR, that is, removal by regression of the timeseries averaged over
the whole brain, was ﬁrst used in application to human task-fMRI in
1998 (Aguirre et al., 1998), and continues to be primarily used as a preprocessing step in human resting state fcMRI (Fox et al., 2009). GSR
removes widely shared variance, much of which, in human fcMRI, is artifact attributable to head motion (Friston et al., 1996; Power et al.,
2012) and ﬂuctuating arterial pCO2 (Birn et al., 2006), although part of
the global signal undoubtedly reﬂects neural activity (Scholvinck et al.,
2010). Within the preprocessing stream of human fcMRI, the global signal is only one of several regressors used to reduce artifact in functional
connectivity patterns (Chai et al., 2012; Jo et al., 2010; Murphy et al.,
2013). The primary virtue of including the global signal in the set of nuisance regressors that this greatly increases the speciﬁcity of computed
correlations (Weissenbacher et al., 2009); the primary drawback is
that all subsequently computed correlations are negatively biased
(Cole et al., 2010; Murphy et al., 2009). Thus, physiology cannot be reliably inferred from the sign of an observed correlation following GSR.
However, in the absence of GSR, all parts of the brain appear to be positively correlated (Chai et al., 2012; Vincent et al., 2006), which also is
biologically implausible (Fox et al., 2005; Popa et al., 2009; Snyder and
Raichle, 2012).

399

In mouse fcOIS, head motion is not an issue generally because the
animals are anesthetized. Nevertheless, GSR is required to remove
widely shared variance attributable to cardiac pulsations (White et al.,
2011). But GSR alone is insufﬁcient in this study, because spectrally
altered and delayed activity is present over the infarcted hemisphere
(Fig. 8B). In can be shown that a delay between two identical signals
will generate anticorrelations following GSR (Murphy et al., 2009). This
effect is prominently illustrated in groups 2 and 3 mice in homotopic
motor, somatosensory, and visual cortices (Figs. 9B, 10, and S5). The
average delay between the infarcted and non-infarcted hemispheres in
these animals was ~1.5 s, which corresponds to a phase shift of ~π/30
to π/4 radians in the frequency band retained in our data (0.009–0.08 Hz).
The MSR approach eliminated apparent anticorrelations between
homotopic regions in mice within groups 2 and 3. For mice with cortical
infarcts, correlation values closer to zero, as obtained using MSR (Figs. 2,
3, 9A, S5), are plausible because infarcted tissue should not be capable of
generating neural signals; MSR also eliminated the appearance of increased somatomotor functional connectivity in both the left (Figs. 3,
10) and right (Figs. 2, S5) hemispheres, and instead resulted in statistically signiﬁcant decreases in functional connectivity with a seed placed
in the ischemic core (Figs. 3, 9, and 10). In contrast, the GSR correlations
suggest that the within-hemisphere connectivity somehow increased
with stroke severity for both the affected and unaffected hemispheres
(e.g. Fig. 9B, right and left somatomotor, Figs. 10, S5) with the infarct
tissue having the highest positive correlation with surrounding brain regions. Apparent increased contralesional intrahemispheric connectivity
would be inconsistent with prior animal studies showing no change in
dendritic morphology in the intact hemisphere following unilateral
stroke (Johnston et al., 2013; Mostany and Portera-Cailliau, 2011).
And, while signiﬁcant increased anatomical connectivity has been observed in the intact hemisphere using manganese-enhanced MRI (van
der Zijden et al., 2007, 2008; van Meer et al., 2010b), unlike the present
acute study, those studies were performed up to 10 weeks after tMCAO;
time points when remodeling and cortical remapping would have
either been initialized or more fully matured. Therefore, the GSR estimate of increased connectivity with increased stroke severity appears
to be an artifact. MSR in functional connectivity studies during stroke
recovery has yet to be done and may provide new insights on cortical
restructuring and functional recruitment after stroke. A better grounding
of regional pair-wise correlations will likely also provide more robust
input data input to novel graph measures aimed at understanding
large-scale network reorganization after stroke (van Meer et al., 2012).
While the differences between MSR and GSR can be modest for some regions (e.g. Fig. 9, retrosplenial and group 2 motor; Fig. 10, group 2 visual)
overall, the present MSR strategy yields less distorted functional connectivity measures than GSR alone and simpliﬁes the interpretation of animal studies of unilateral stroke using both fcOIS and fcMRI (van Meer
et al., 2010a, 2012). Outside of the context of stroke, our MSR approach
would also prove amenable to measuring functional connectivity immediately following cortical spreading depression where spontaneous
activity would be very incoherent between hemispheres (Li et al., 2012).
Limitations of the current study
One physical limitation of OIS (due to light scattering) is the restriction of the ﬁeld of view to the cortical surface (b 1 mm), which precludes
direct mapping of deep brain structures, and in the current context,
segmentation of lateral and subcortical infarcts. This limitation is most
apparent when calculating functional connectivity values for mice in
Group 1 where GSR is used, despite potential temporal differences occurring over the cortex between homotopic regions (Fig. 8D). It was recently shown in human stroke patients that the degree of functional
disruption following ischemia has to do more with lesion location and
less with lesion extent. So, while the physics of light transport through
biological tissue may limit fcOIS to the cortical surface, fcOIS is still sensitive to the effects of subcortical infarcts, as clear functional disruption

400

A.Q. Bauer et al. / NeuroImage 99 (2014) 388–401

is observed within our ﬁeld of view from distant lesions (as seen in the
functional connectivity patterns of group 1 mice in Figs. 2 and 3).
Whole-brain imaging is still possible using diffuse optical tomography
methods, and the ability of assessing functional disruption in deep
brain structures would be useful for understanding how damage to subcortical structures might affect the entire mouse brain.
Conclusions
In this study, we applied fcOIS imaging to mouse models of ischemic
stroke to evaluate how graded ischemic injury incrementally impacts the
relationship between functional connectivity, forepaw responses, infarct
volume, and behavior in the mouse before and 72 h after tMCAO. Disruption of cortical activations and behavior in the affected limb were proportional to infarct size, and correlated with regional deﬁcits in functional
connectivity. Additionally, because spontaneous hemodynamic activity
within the infarct exhibited altered temporal and spectral features, our
data suggest that accounting for the separate hemodynamics occurring
in the healthy and damaged hemispheres might provide a more accurate
method for calculating functional connectivity after stroke. Because
homotopic functional connectivity has been strongly associated with behavioral and functional outcome in post-stroke patients, accounting for
regional hemodynamic differences in functional connectivity analyses
could aid interpretation of functional mechanisms responsible for behavioral recovery after injury. Given that resting-state functional connectivity measures have provided valuable information regarding functional
organization in the human brain, we are now in a unique position to
probe questions about post-stroke recovery mechanisms and the role
of ipsilesional and contralesional functional connectivity on recovery
using fcOIS.
