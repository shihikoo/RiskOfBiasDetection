The peripheral immune response contributes to neurodegeneration after stroke yet little is known about how
this process differs between males and females. The current study demonstrates that splenectomy prior to
experimental stroke eliminates sex differences in infarct volume and activated brain monocytes/microglia. In
the periphery of both sexes, activated T cells correlate directly with stroke outcome while monocytes are reduced
by splenectomy only in males. This study provides new information about the sex speciﬁc mechanisms of the
peripheral immune response in neurodegeneration after stroke and demonstrates the need for representation
of both sexes in basic and clinical stroke research.

1. Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the
United States. The role that the immune response plays in neurodegeneration following stroke has been well documented. Leukocyte activation in the spleen after stroke results in a release of immune cells into
the blood, inﬁltration of leukocytes and activation of microglial cells in
the brain, leading to an increase in infarct volume (Offner et al., 2006a,
2006b; Seifert et al., 2012a, 2012b). Long-term systemic immunosuppression is an additional consequence of massive stroke-induced
splenocyte activation.
It is now increasingly clear that males and females respond to stroke
differently. Females have a lower incidence of stroke and are relatively
protected from immediate ischemia compared to males (Sudlow and
Warlow, 1997; Alkayed et al., 1998; Murphy et al., 2004). Females also
exhibit less stroke-induced splenic damage, which is hypothesized to
correlate with their reduced infarct volume (Banerjee et al., 2013).
However, females suffer higher rates of disability and handicap over
time compared to males (Di Carlo et al., 2003). The underlying molecular and inﬂammatory mechanisms that lead to stroke-induced sex

discrepancy have not been extensively studied. Female mice exhibit a
decrease in inﬁltrating and activated monocytes/microglia in the
ischemic brain after MCAO compared to males (Banerjee et al., 2013).
In conjunction with splenic damage, males have more activated T cells
in the spleen following MCAO than females (Banerjee et al., 2013). Additional pre-clinical data in female animals is needed in order to develop
new stroke therapies that will convey clinical success in both sexes.
Although differences in the spleen have been observed between
post-MCAO male and female mice, the effect of the spleen on infarct volume and stroke progression is relatively unknown in female animals.
Splenectomy in male rodents prior to experimental stroke reduces infarct volume and neurodegeneration by decreasing T cells, neutrophils,
macrophages and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, while increasing antiinﬂammatory cytokines in brain tissue (Zhang et al., 2013). Additionally, irradiation of the male spleen 4 h after MCAO reduces infarct volume
by abrogating deployment of splenocytes and decreasing microglia and
inﬁltrating T cells in the ischemic brain (Ostrowski et al., 2012).
In this study, we examine the role of the spleen during stroke in
female mice. Male and female mice underwent splenectomy or sham
splenectomy two weeks prior to transient MCAO. After 96 h of reperfusion, infarct volume was determined and peripheral and ischemic brain
speciﬁc immunological parameters were studied. We found that the sex
difference observed in infarct volume after MCAO was abrogated with
splenectomy. Activated T cells in the periphery correlated with the sex
and splenectomy difference seen in the infarct volume while CD11b +
monocytes were an indicating factor of stroke outcome in male mice. Finally, immune gene expression in the ischemic brain varied, with some

genes being directly correlated with infarct volume while others were
more affected by splenectomy or sex. The current study provides new
insight to how the immune response contributes to sex differences
after stroke.

anesthetized with isoﬂurane throughout ischemia and reperfusion.
Head and body temperature were controlled as described above. Mice
were euthanized after the ﬁnal blood sample was taken 15 min into
the reperfusion period.

2. Materials and methods

2.5. Infarct volume analysis

2.1. Ethics statement

Brains were harvested after 96 h of reperfusion and sliced into ﬁve 2mm-thick coronal sections for staining with 1.2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in saline as described
previously (Hurn et al., 2007). The 2-mm brain sections were incubated
in 1.2% TTC for 15 min at 37 °C, and then ﬁxed in 10% formalin for 24 h.
Infarct volume was measured using digital imaging and image analysis
software (Systat, Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA). To control for edema,
infarct volume (cortex, striatum, and hemisphere) was determined by
subtraction of the ipsilateral noninfarcted regional volume from the
contralateral regional volume. This value was then divided by the
contralateral regional volume and multiplied by 100 to yield regional
infarct volume as a percent of the contralateral region.

The study was conducted in accordance with National Institutes of
Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals, and the protocols
were approved by the Portland Veteran Affairs Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, protocol # 2840-12, local database ID # 2840 and the Oregon Health and Science University Animal
Care and Use Committee, protocol # IS00001589.
2.2. Experimental animals
Male and female C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Sacramento, CA, USA) weighing 20–25 g were housed in a
climate-controlled room on a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Food and
water were provided ad libitum.

2.6. Leukocyte isolation from brains and blood

Splenectomy was done under isoﬂurane anesthesia (induction 5.0%
and maintenance 2.0% delivered via a face mask in O2-enriched air). A
longitudinal incision (10–15 mm) was made on the left dorsolateral
side of the abdomen, caudal to the last rib, and then a 10 mm incision
in the peritoneal wall was made. The splenic arteries and efferent venous were ligated with sterilized 6-0 silk sutures separately by looping
the sutures through the mesentery. The mesentery and connective tissue were cut and the spleen removed. Abdominal muscle incisions
and skin were closed using sterilized 6-0 absorbable sutures separately.
Sham splenectomized mice underwent all anesthetic and surgical
manipulations without handling or removing the spleen. Spleens were
removed 14 days before MCAO.

Blood was obtained from cardiac puncture 96 h after MCAO. Red
blood cells were lysed using 1× red blood cell lysis buffer (eBioscience,
Inc., San Diego, CA) for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then
washed with RPMI 1640, counted on a hemocytometer and resuspended in staining medium (PBS containing 0.1% NaN3 and 1% bovine serum
albumin (Sigma, Illinois)) for ﬂow cytometry. The brain was divided
into the ischemic (right) and nonischemic (left) hemispheres, digested
for 60 min with 1 mg/mL Type IV collagenase (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) and DNase I (50 mg/mL, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) at
37 °C with intermittent shaking. Samples were mixed with a 1 mL
pipette every 15 min. The suspension was washed 1× in RPMI, resuspended in 80% Percoll overlayed with 40% Percoll and centrifuged for
30 min at 1600 RPM. The cells were then washed twice with RPMI
1640 and resuspended in staining medium for ﬂow cytometry or stimulation medium for intracellular cytokine detection.

2.4. Middle cerebral artery occlusion model

2.7. Analysis of cell populations by ﬂow cytometry

Two weeks after splenectomy or sham splenectomy, transient focal
cerebral ischemia was induced in male and female mice for 1 h by
reversible right MCAO under isoﬂurane anesthesia followed by 96 h of
reperfusion as described previously (Zhang et al., 2008). Head and
body temperature were controlled at 37.0 ± 1.0 °C throughout MCAO
surgery with warm water pads and a heating lamp. Occlusion and reperfusion were veriﬁed in each animal by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry
(LDF) (Model DRT4, Moor Instruments Ltd., Wilmington, DE). The common carotid artery was exposed and the external carotid artery was ligated and cauterized. Unilateral MCAO was accomplished by inserting
a 6-0 nylon monoﬁlament surgical suture (ETHICON, Inc., Somerville,
NJ, USA) with a heat-rounded and silicone-coated (Xantopren Comfort
Light, Heraeus, Germany) tip into the internal carotid artery via the
external carotid artery stump. Adequacy of MCAO was conﬁrmed by
monitoring cortical blood ﬂow at the onset of the occlusion with a
LDF probe afﬁxed to the skull. Animals were excluded if mean intraischemic LDF was greater than 30% pre-ischemic baseline LDF. At 1 h
of occlusion, the occluding ﬁlament was withdrawn to allow for reperfusion. Mice were then allowed to recover from anesthesia and survived
for 96 h following initiation of reperfusion.
Femoral arterial catheters were placed in separate groups of spleen
intact and splenectomized male and female mice (n = 5 per group) to
determine mean arterial blood pressure, blood gases (pH, PaO2, and
PaCO2), and blood glucose values at 30 min of MCAO (intra-ischemic)
and at 15 min of reperfusion (early reperfusion). Laser Doppler
ﬂowmetry was also monitored as described above. Animals were

All antibodies were purchased (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA or
eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA). Four-color (FITC, PE, APC, PECy5 and/
or PerCP) ﬂuorescence ﬂow cytometry analyses were performed to determine the phenotypes of blood and brain cells. 1–2 × 105 cells were
washed with staining medium, blocked with anti-mouse CD16/CD32
Mouse BD Fc Block™ (BD Biosciences, San Jose) and then incubated
with combinations of the following monoclonal antibodies: CD11b
(MAC-1), CD45 (Ly-5), CD3 (145-2C11), CD11c (HL-3), CD19 (1D3),
CD4 (GK1.5), CD8 (53-6.7), CD122 (TM-β1), CD44 (IM7), CCR5 (HMCCR5) and CD25 (7D4) for 20 min at 4 °C. 7-AAD was added to identify
and exclude dead cells in the analysis. CD4 + regulatory T cells
were identiﬁed using Foxp3 (FJK-16s) and accompanying ﬁxation/
permeabilization reagents as per manufacturer's instructions
(eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA). Isotype matched mAb served as
a negative control. Data were collected with BD AccuriTM C6 software
on a BD AccuriTM C6 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

2.3. Splenectomy

2.8. Intracellular staining
Brain cells from individual mice were cultured at 2 × 105 cells/well in
a 96-well culture plate in stimulation medium (RPMI, 1% sodium
pyruvate, 1% L-glutamine, 0.4% 2-β-mercaptoethanol, 2% FBS) with
PMA (50 ng/mL), ionomycin (500 ng/mL) and brefeldin A (1 μL/mL)
(all reagents from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells
were blocked, surface stained (as described above) and then ﬁxed and
permeabilized using a Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences), according

A.L. Dotson et al. / Journal of Neuroimmunology 278 (2015) 289–298

to manufacturer's instructions. Fixed cells were washed with 1× permeabilization buffer (BD Biosciences) and stained with the following antibodies: IFN-γ, TNF-a, IL-17 or IL-21. Isotype matched mAbs served as
negative controls to establish background cytokine staining levels.

p = 0.042). Mean arterial blood pressure, blood gases (pH, PaO2, and
PaCO2), and blood glucose were comparable among male and female
spleen intact and splenectomized experimental groups at 15 min of
reperfusion (Supplemental Table 1). There were differences between ischemic and reperfusion pH values within spleen intact males (ischemic:
7.40 ± 0.02; reperfusion: 7.49 ± 0.02; p = 0.009) and splenectomized
males (ischemic: 7.48 ± 0.03; reperfusion: 7.41 ± 0.04; p = 0.049).

2.9. Real time PCR
Ischemic hemispheres were harvested from mice 96 h after MCAO,
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until processed. Total
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase cDNA synthesis kit
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Quantitative real time PCR was
performed using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System with TaqMan
Gene Expression Array Plates for mouse immune response. cDNA from
three mice was pooled per group for gene array plates. Individual samples were analyzed in triplicate for IL-6 (Mm00446190_m1), P-selectin
(Mm01295931_m1) and IL-10 (Mm00439614_m1) (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY) using the ABI7000 Sequence Detection System.
GAPDH housekeeping gene was used as an endogenous control. Results
were analyzed using DataAssist Software (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY).
2.10. Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Differences in cortical, striatal,
and total (hemispheric) infarct volume as well as mean arterial blood
pressure, blood gases (pH, PaO2, and PaCO2), and blood glucose were
subjected to two-way ANOVA with post hoc Newman–Keuls test. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat Statistical Software,
Version 3.1 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Cellular subtypes for FACS
analysis were analyzed by Student's t-test using Prism (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA). Statistical comparisons were made between
spleen-intact males vs. females, splenectomized males vs. females,
spleen-intact males vs. splenectomized males and spleen-intact females
vs. splenectomized females. Statistical signiﬁcance was p b 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Splenectomy attenuates sex differences in infarct volume following
experimental stroke in mice
Male and female mice underwent splenectomy or sham splenectomy two weeks prior to 1 h of MCAO. Infarct volume was measured
after 96 h of reperfusion. In agreement with our recent study
(Banerjee et al., 2013), spleen-intact male mice had signiﬁcantly
larger infarct volume than spleen-intact female mice (Fig. 1A). Our
ﬁndings also support previous studies from other labs (Zhang et al.,
2013) indicating that splenectomy signiﬁcantly reduced infarct
volume in male mice (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, splenectomy did not
further reduce infarct volume in female mice and there was no difference between splenectomized male and splenectomized female
infarct volume (Fig. 1B) indicating that splenectomy abrogates the
sex difference observed in brain damage following stroke.
Mean arterial blood pressure and blood glucose were comparable
among male and female spleen intact and splenectomized experimental
groups at 30 min of MCAO (Supplemental Table 1). However, there
were differences in pH values between splenectomized males (7.48 ±
0.03) and splenectomized females (7.38 ± 0.03, p = 0.043). There
were also differences in PaO2 values between spleen intact females
(162 ± 5 mm Hg) and splenectomized males (137 ± 7; p = 0.023)
and in PaCO2 values between splenectomized males (22 ± 2 mm Hg)
and splenectomized females (33 ± 3 mm Hg, p = 0.023) as well as between splenectomized males and spleen intact males (33 ± 1 mm Hg,

3.2. Sex differences in peripheral immune frequencies following stroke are
CD4+ T cell based
We wanted to identify possible immunological mechanisms in the
periphery that could be contributing to the differences in infarct volume
we observed with splenectomy and between the sexes. There was no
signiﬁcant difference between males and females, either spleen-intact
or splenectomized, in frequency of total T cells in the blood after
MCAO (Fig. 2A). Of note, there was an increase in frequency of total
CD3+ T cells in the blood after MCAO in splenectomized compared to
spleen-intact animals (Fig. 2A). We hypothesize that this difference is
an artifact of splenectomy, not an effect of stroke. There was a signiﬁcant
difference in the CD4:CD8 ratio in the blood between spleen-intact
males and females following MCAO that was not observed with
splenectomized males and females (Fig. 2B). The difference in the
CD4:CD8 ratio of spleen-intact animals can be attributed to a trending
decrease of CD4+ T cells (p = 0.06) in the periphery of spleen-intact
females after MCAO compared to spleen-intact males (Fig. 2C) as no
signiﬁcant difference was observed in the frequency of CD8 + T cells
in the blood with any of groups (Fig. 2D). Additionally, we observed a
signiﬁcant increase in the CD4:CD8 ratio and frequency of CD4 + T
cells in the periphery of splenectomized females compared to spleenintact females following MCAO (Fig. 2B, C) solidifying the hypothesis
that peripheral CD4+ T cells are altered in females compared to males
after MCAO and that difference is lost with splenectomy.
3.3. Peripheral T cell activation after MCAO is reduced in females and
splenectomized males
Although we saw no difference between the sexes in the frequency of peripheral T cells after MCAO, we wanted to examine their activation state. We found that CD44hi activated T cells were greater
in the periphery of spleen-intact male mice after MCAO compared
to either spleen-intact female mice or splenectomized male mice
(Fig. 3A). Although not signiﬁcant, a similar trend was seen with
the expression of tissue homing chemokine receptor, CCR5, on T
cells following MCAO (Fig. 3B). The sex difference observed in
peripheral activated T cells after MCAO supports our hypothesis
that T cell activation in the periphery inﬂuences stroke outcome
and that sex difference is no longer observed following splenectomy.
3.4. Regulatory T cells in the periphery after MCAO are affected by sex and
splenectomy
Regulatory T cells have been documented to increase in the
periphery following MCAO in male mice (Offner et al., 2006a). Of
the four groups of mice, the frequency of CD25+Foxp3 +CD4 + regulatory T cells were the greatest in spleen-intact females after MCAO
(Fig. 4A). The frequency signiﬁcantly dropped in splenectomized females after MCAO and there was no change between spleen-intact
and splenectomized males after MCAO (Fig. 4A). The frequency of
peripheral CD122+IL-10+CD8 + regulatory T cells was not signiﬁcantly different among any of the groups following MCAO although
spleen-intact females did exhibit a trend increase (p = 0.09) in
CD8 + regulatory T cells compared to spleen-intact male mice
(Fig. 4B). These data suggest that regulatory T cells may have an
early protective effect in the periphery of spleen-intact females
after MCAO that is no longer necessary in the splenectomized

weeks prior to transient MCAO (60 min). Brains were harvested 96 h after MCAO and brain slices were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (A). Infarct volumes
were measured as percentage of contralateral structure (B). Values represent mean numbers (±SEM) of 11 spleen-intact male and female mice; n = 12 for splenectomized males and

females. Additionally, regulatory T cells may not play a signiﬁcant
role in stroke outcome in male mice.
3.5. Peripheral CD11b + monocytes are reduced in splenectomized male
mice after MCAO
We wanted to examine other immune subsets in the periphery that
could possibly affect stroke outcome. The frequency of CD19+ B cells
did not change among any of the groups following MCAO (Table 1).
We did observe signiﬁcant differences in CD11c + dendritic cells
(DCs) among the groups after MCAO. However, the total frequency of
DCs was so low it is doubtful the slight but signiﬁcant differences
could not have any profound effects on stroke outcome (Table 1).
There was a signiﬁcant and substantial reduction in the frequency of
CD11b+ monocytes (29.5% to 16.2%) in the blood of splenectomized
male mice following MCAO compared to spleen-intact male mice
(Fig. 5). These data indicate that peripheral CD11b+ cells are important
in stroke outcome in male but possibly not female mice.
3.6. Splenectomy attenuates sex differences in activated microglia/
monocytes in the ischemic brain following experimental stroke
To examine whether sex differences in the peripheral immune
response affect tissue speciﬁc inﬂammation, we looked at inﬁltrating
and activated monocytes/microglia in the cerebral ischemic hemisphere. The frequency CD11b+CD45hi inﬁltrating and activated

monocytes/microglia in the ischemic brain was reduced in spleenintact females, splenectomized males and splenectomized females
after MCAO compared to spleen-intact males (Fig. 6A). This difference
was signiﬁcant when comparing inﬁltrating and activated monocytes/
microglia between spleen-intact males and spleen-intact females or
splenectomized males after MCAO (Fig. 6B). Concurrent with infarct
volume data, there was no signiﬁcant difference in inﬁltrating and
activated monocytes/microglia between spleen-intact females and
splenectomized females or splenectomized males and females following MCAO (Fig. 6B).
3.7. Sex and splenectomy affect immune gene expression proﬁle in the
ischemic brain after MCAO
In order to further assess the mechanism of decreased infarct
volume and activated monocytes/microglia with males compared to females and splenectomized animals, we examined immune related
genes in the ischemic hemisphere after MCAO using real-time PCR.
cDNA was pooled from three samples for each group, results were normalized to GAPDH and presented as relative expression compared to
male MCAO only (Fig. 7A). Only parameters that exhibited a two-fold
increase or decrease were included in the results. Adhesion molecules
and cell signaling genes were largely down-regulated with all groups
compared to male MCAO only while cell subset markers, cell death
genes, cytokines, costimulatory molecules, chemokines and chemokine
receptors exhibited mixed expression patterns (Fig. 7A). Some

Fig. 2. Sex differences in peripheral immune frequencies following stroke are CD4+ T cell based. Blood was harvested 96 h after MCAO from spleen-intact and splenectomized mice and
immunophenotyped by ﬂow cytometry. The frequency of CD3+ T cells was determined (A). CD4:CD8 ratio was determined by dividing the frequency of CD4+ cells by the frequency of
CD8+ cells (B). CD4 and CD8 T cells were gated on CD3 and the frequency was reported as the percent CD4 or CD8 positive of total CD3+ cells (C, D). Values represent mean numbers
(±SEM) of 5 mice from each group for CD4 and CD8 analysis and 8–9 mice per group for CD3 analysis. * indicates p b 0.05, ** indicates p b 0.01 and *** indicates p b 0.001 by t-test.

parameters were affected more by sex such as IL-12a and multiple cell
signaling and costimulatory genes while others were affected more
with splenectomy, namely, CD8a and H2-Ea expression. Three genes
were chosen to validate the immune gene array data with individual
samples. IL-6, P-selectin and IL-10 all conﬁrm trends of gene expression
observed in the array analysis compared to male MCAO only (Fig. 7B).
Cytokine production by speciﬁc leukocytes in the ischemic hemisphere
additionally follows trends exhibited with the gene expression
(Table 2). The data suggests a complex system of gene regulation and

expression that is affected by both sex and splenectomy and leads to
an overall protection from stroke induced ischemia.
4. Discussion
The peripheral and brain-speciﬁc inﬂammatory response to cerebral
ischemia has been widely studied, though mainly in male animals.
Young female mice exhibit smaller infarct volumes than males following experimental stroke (Alkayed et al., 1998; Banerjee et al., 2013;
Manwani et al., 2013). Immunological factors thought to inﬂuence the

sex stroke difference 96 h after MCAO are inﬁltrating and activated
monocytes/microglia in the brain and T cell subsets in the periphery
(Banerjee et al., 2013). Splenic atrophy, a hallmark of post-stroke peripheral immune activation, is signiﬁcantly reduced in young female
mice after experimental stroke compared to males (Banerjee et al.,
2013; Manwani et al., 2013). The comparison of spleen in intact and
splenectomized male and female mice allows for a unique investigation
into the effects of the peripheral immune response on the different
sexes after MCAO.
The current study veriﬁes that infarct volume is smaller in young female mice compared to males and in splenectomized males compared
to spleen-intact males following experimental stroke. Additionally we
demonstrate that the sex infarct volume difference is eliminated with
splenectomy in MCAO mice. Our ﬁndings are not explained by differences in physiological parameters among treatment groups. Although
differences were seen in pH values between splenectomized males
and females during ischemia and between ischemic and reperfusion
time points within spleen intact and splenectomized male groups,
these values fell within the reported normal reference range for mice.
It is therefore unlikely that these differences account for the effect of
splenectomy on attenuating sex differences in infarct volume. Differences
in arterial O2 tension between intact females and splenectomized males
also unlikely affected infarct volumes as both of these groups, along
with the other experimental groups, were hyperoxic (N120 mm Hg)
but cerebral blood ﬂow has been shown to be relatively unchanged
by hyperoxia. Compared to spleen intact males and splenectomized females, splenectomized male mice had signiﬁcantly lower arterial CO2 tension during ischemia but had comparable values to all experimental

groups in the early reperfusion period. However, it is unlikely that the
hypocapnia observed in splenectomized male mice during ischemia
accounts for the protective effect of splenectomy on infarct volume in
males as a relative hypocapnia would decrease cerebral blood ﬂow and
thus would have further exacerbated infarct volume. Furthermore, the
LDF signal was reduced by a similar percentage of baseline values in all
groups, suggesting that relative cerebral blood ﬂow was equivalent
among all groups despite any differences in PaO2 or PaCO2 during ischemia. There were no differences in physiological parameters among the
experimental groups during the early reperfusion period.
The frequency of peripheral T cells did not differ between both
spleen-intact or splenectomized males and females. However, there
was a signiﬁcant difference in the CD4:CD8 ratio in the blood following
MCAO between spleen-intact males and females which correlates with
CD4+ T cells in the periphery of the male mice. These data are consistent with an increase of CD4+ T cells observed in the spleens of male

Fig. 6. Splenectomy attenuates sex differences in activated microglia/monocytes in the ischemic brain following experimental stroke. Brains were harvested 96 h after MCAO from spleenintact and splenectomized mice, processed and immunophenotyped by ﬂow cytometry. Inﬁltrating and activated monocytes/microglia was determined by gating on CD11b + cells and
examining CD45 high cells. Representative dot plots (A) and averages (B) of CD11b+CD45hi cell frequencies in the ischemic hemisphere are included. Values represent mean numbers

vs. female MCAO mice (Banerjee et al., 2013). There is also an overall increase in the frequency of peripheral CD3+ T cells in both male and female splenectomized mice compared to spleen-intact mice after MCAO.
This increase in T cell numbers could be attributed to the phenomenon
of peripheral leukocytosis due to splenectomy (Djaldetti et al., 2003)
and did not correlate with an increase in either activated or regulatory
T cells, nor did it have a direct effect on CD3+ gene expression in the
brain and therefore did not appear to affect stroke outcome.
Among the total T cells in the periphery after MCAO, there were signiﬁcantly more CD44high expressing effector T cells than in spleen-intact
male mice. CD44 is a widely expressed adhesion receptor that is upregulated on the T cell surface following activation and can lead to cell
migration and recruitment to inﬂammatory sites, thereby exacerbating
inﬂammatory conditions (Johnson and Ruffell, 2009). Since we did not
observe a signiﬁcant increase of CCR5, a chemokine receptor involved
in leukocyte homing to sites of inﬂammation, present on peripheral T
cells from spleen-intact males, we speculate that CD44 along with
other adhesion molecules are more important for inﬂammatory cell
migration to the brain following stroke. There was also a trend increase
in CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ and CD8+CD122+IL-10+ regulatory T cells
in the periphery of spleen-intact females after experimental stroke.
Although CD4+ regulatory T cells have an established role in suppressing inﬂammation, there are contradicting reports whether they are
beneﬁcial, harmful or have no effect on neurodegeneration following
stroke (Schabitz, 2013; Liesz et al., 2009; Planas and Chamorro, 2009;
Li et al., 2013; Kleinschnitz et al., 2013, Kleinschnitz and Wiendl, 2013,
Ren et al., 2011; Gu et al., 2012; Stubbe et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013).
CD8 + regulatory T cells regulate immune effector function using
perforin and IL-10 (Wang and Alexander, 2009) and have been
observed in conjunction with neuroprotection following stroke
(Banerjee et al., 2013; Bodhankar et al., 2013). Although we observe a
similar trend in CD8 + regulatory T cells as with CD4 + regulatory
cells from spleen-intact females, it is unclear whether such a small percentage of IL-10 producing cells in the periphery could have an effect on
infarct volume. Taken together, the dynamic and inverse shift between
effector and regulatory T cell phenotype suggests that regulatory T cells
may have a protective effect in the periphery of spleen-intact females

after MCAO compared to spleen-intact males. That difference is lost or
no longer necessary in the splenectomized mice. Additionally, since
splenectomy did not have an effect on CD4 + regulatory T cells in
male mice, it appears not to play a signiﬁcant role in stroke outcome
in males.
Experimental stroke leads to an increase in circulating CD11b +
monocytes (Offner et al., 2006b). Activated monocytes and macrophages secrete inﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα
which can perpetuate the inﬂammatory state and lead to tissue speciﬁc
monocyte homing. Spleen-intact male mice exhibited a signiﬁcant and
sizable increase in circulating CD11b + monocytes compared to
splenectomized male mice following MCAO. The same difference was
not observed between spleen-intact and splenectomized female mice.
Additionally, there was no signiﬁcant sex difference in the frequency
of blood CD11b + monocytes with spleen-intact animals, suggesting
that peripheral CD11b + monocytes may be important for neurodegenerative progression in males and possibly do not have as much of a
detrimental effect in females.
It is known that the spleen exacerbates brain inﬂammation after
stroke and splenectomy prior to experimental stoke decreases infarct
volume through anti-inﬂammatory effects (Seifert et al., 2012b; Zhang
et al., 2013). To determine if the effects of the spleen on brain inﬂammation differed between males and females, we ﬁrst looked at inﬁltrating
and activated monocytes/microglia in the ischemic hemisphere
with and without splenectomy. As expected, the number of activated
monocytes/microglia correlated directly with infarct volume after
MCAO, with a signiﬁcant decrease in spleen-intact females and
splenectomized males compared with spleen-intact males. One factor that contributes to the sex difference observed in activated
monocytes/microglia is estrogen. Estrogen inhibits the proliferation
of microglia in vitro, attenuates macrophage cytokine production
and can reduce the monocyte inﬁltration to the ischemic brain by
dampening migration and adhesive capabilities (Ritzel et al., 2013).
Additionally, no difference was observed between spleen-intact and
splenectomized females.
To further examine the mechanism in the brain, we looked at
differences in immune gene expression in the ischemic hemisphere.

Spleen-intact female mice had decreased CD3, CD4 and CD8 expression
after MCAO, while splenectomized mice varied in CD3 expression but
downregulated CD4 and upregulated CD8 expression compared to
male MCAO only mice. Although the increase in CD8 did not correlate
with IL-10 production, indicating CD8 + Tregs, the elevation in CD8
did not increase neurodegeneration. Adhesion molecules are known to
play an important role in leukocyte inﬁltration into the brain after
experimental stroke and their blockade results in reduced infarct
volume (Yilmaz and Granger, 2008; Zhang et al., 1998). Cell signal
genes have also been shown to affect stroke outcome (Ziv et al., 1992;
Yusuf et al., 2000). Overall, there was a substantial decrease of adhesion
molecule and cell signaling expression with all groups compared to
spleen-intact males after MCAO, albeit more reduced with the two female groups, which could account for neuroprotection observed in
those groups. Inﬂammatory cytokines are known to contribute to neuroinﬂammation after stroke (Seifert et al., 2012b; Barone et al., 1997;
Feuerstein et al., 1994; Bond et al., 2002; Slevin et al., 2008). We observed a decrease in gene expression in all the mouse groups for TNF,
IL-6 and Lif and to a lesser extent, IL-17 and IFNγ in females compared
to spleen-intact males after MCAO.
This study demonstrates that the peripheral immune response contributes to the infarct volume-associated sex difference in experimental
stroke. Both sex and splenectomy reduce activated T cells in the periphery after MCAO, while CD11b + monocytes were affected more by
splenectomy than by sex. In the ischemic brain, sex and splenectomy inﬂuenced activated monocytes/microglia and expression of adhesion
molecules, cell signaling molecules and speciﬁc inﬂammatory cytokines.
Taken together, these data provide new information about the sexspeciﬁc mechanisms of the peripheral immune response in neurodegeneration after stroke. Additionally, this study demonstrates the significant need for representation of both males and females in biological
and clinical stroke research.
