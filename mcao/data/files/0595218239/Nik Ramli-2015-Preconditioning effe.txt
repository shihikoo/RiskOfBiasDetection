a b s t r a c t
Glutamate receptors are the integral cellular components associated with excitotoxicity mechanism
induced by the ischemic cascade events. Therefore the glutamate receptors have become the major
molecular targets of neuroprotective agents in stroke researches. Recent studies have demonstrated
that a Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ((S)-3,5-DHPG)
preconditioning elicits neuroprotection in the hippocampal slice cultures exposed to toxic level of
N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA). We further investigated the preconditioning effects of (S)-3,5-DHPG
on acute ischemic stroke rats. One 10 or 100 ␮M of (S)-3,5-DHPG was administered intrathecally to
Sprague–Dawley adult male rats, 2 h prior to induction of acute ischemic stroke by middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO). After 24 h, neurological deﬁcits were evaluated by modiﬁed stroke severity
scores and grid-walking test. All rats were sacriﬁced and infarct volumes were determined by 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The serum level of neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) of each rat was
analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). One and 10 ␮M of (S)-3,5-DHPG preconditioning in the stroke rats showed signiﬁcant improvements in motor impairment (P < 0.01), reduction in the
infarct volume (P < 0.01) and reduction in the NSE serum level (P < 0.01) compared to the control stroke
rats. We conclude that 1 and 10 ␮M (S)-3,5-DHPG preconditioning induced protective effects against
acute ischemic insult in vivo.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke which contributes 87% of total stroke is a devastating cause of death and the most causative factor of long
term disability worldwide [1,2]. The greatest challenge in most

ischemic stroke cases is that the therapeutic interventions are
time-dependent due to the nature of the neuronal cells which
are incapable of regeneration. Olney and Sharpe ﬁrst introduced
the concept of excitotoxicity as one of the key events in the
ischemic cascade [3]. This concept is based on the fact that during ischemia, there is an over-activation of postsynaptic glutamate
receptors in response to the excessive release of presynaptic glutamate which leads to massive excitation then death of the brain cells.
Consequently, many animal studies have focused on the neuroprotective effects of glutamate receptor antagonists [4–6]. In contrast

to the concept of excitotoxicity, current in vitro studies have
demonstrated neuroprotective preconditioning effects by selective
activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs).
One particular study has used (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ((S)3,5-DHPG) which is a potent agonist of group I mGluRs and
demonstrated that activation of the receptors two hours prior to
the acute N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) toxicity in cultured hippocampal cells have signiﬁcantly reduced the propidium iodide (PI)
uptake, prevented fragmentation of the cell nucleus and decreased
in caspase-3 activity as compared to the cells that exposed to acute
NMDA toxicity per se [7]. Even though there are very few literatures concerning the neuroprotective effects of (S)-3,5-DHPG [8,9],
the preconditioning effect of (S)-3,5-DHPG in vivo seems to warrant
further studies. In the present study, we investigated the preconditioning effect of intrathecal (S)-3,5-DHPG by assessing the degree
of neurological deﬁcits, infarct volume and serum neuron speciﬁc
enolase (NSE) in the middle cerebral artery occluded rats.

given for each abnormal observation. A total score was calculated
and severity of stroke was classiﬁed as follows: severe (10–14),
moderate (5–9), mild (1–4) or no neurological impairment (0) [12].
Thus, the higher score, the more severe is the injury.

2. Materials and methods

2.5. 2, 3, 5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining

2.1. Animals

All rats were euthanized by terminal cardiac puncture. The brain
was extracted and chilled in ice-cold saline (0.9% NaCl) for 2 min.
Five slices of 2-mm thickness coronal brain sections were dissected at + 5, +3, + 1, −1 and −3 anterior–posterior from the bregma
using an acrylic brain matrix (Ted Pella). The slices were immersed
in 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution (Merck) for
15 min at 37◦ C in a dark room. The images of the slices were
captured using a digital camera (Lumix DMC-S5, Panasonic) and
analyzed using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health,
USA). The infarct volume for all ﬁve slices was estimated [14] and
presented as total infarct volume in mm3 .

All experiments were approved by Animal Ethics Committee of
Universiti Teknologi MARA (ACUC/CA/07 (030-UiTM). Twenty adult
male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–350 g) were obtained from Laboratory Animal Care Unit of Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia.
The rats were placed in a room with 12:12 light-dark cycle and
controlled temperature (25 ◦ C). All rats were randomly assigned
into four groups (n = 5 for each group) which consisted of control,
1, 10 and 100 ␮M of (S)-3,5-DHPG.

2.4.2. The grid-walking test
The grid walking test (GWT) was performed to assess the degree
of motor impairment of the rats. Each rat was placed on an elevated metal square-shaped frame grid unit. The performance was
recorded for 5 min using a video camera (Handycam DCR-SX22E/B,
Sony). A foot slip was considered as error of one limb climbing
the grid: when the paw completely missed a rung with limb fell
between the rungs, or when the paw was correctly placed on the
rung but slipped off during weigh bearing [13]. Foot slips and footsteps of right and left forelimb and hind limb were counted. The
motor impairment was expressed as a percentage of foot slips over
footsteps for each rat [13].

2.2. (S)-3,5,-DHPG preconditioning
2.6. Estimation of serum neuron speciﬁc enolase
(S)-3,5-DHPG (Tocris Bioscience) was diluted with sterile distilled water as recommended and previous literatures [7]. Each
suspension consisted of 1, 10 or 100 ␮M of (S)-3,5-DHPG with pH
of 7.4. Twenty ␮l of 1, 10 or 100 ␮M of (S)-3,5-DHPG was administrated intrathecally [10] 2 h prior to the middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) procedure. For control rats, twenty ␮l of sterile
distilled water was used instead of (S)-3,5-DHPG.

NSE is a glycolytic enzyme mainly synthesized in neurons and a
speciﬁc serum marker for neuronal cell damages [15,16]. Serum
was obtained from the blood that was collected by the cardiac
puncture in 2.5 [17]. NSE level was estimated using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (USCN Life Science Inc.). Absorbance
was measured at 450 nm ± 10 nm by a microtiter plate reader.

2.3. Induction of ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion

2.7. Statistical analysis

All rats were subjected to left total MCAO using an intraluminal technique [11]. The rats were anesthetized with a mixture of
xylazine (1.5 ml of 100 mg/ml) and ketamine (10 ml of 100 mg/ml)
intraperitoneally (0.1 ml/100 g of body weight). In brief, the left
external carotid artery (ECA), common carotid artery (CCA) and
internal carotid artery (ICA) were separated, and the ECA was
ligated. A microvascular clip was applied at the left ICA and an arteriotomy was made at the CCA, 5 mm from the bifurcation of ECA and
ICA. A 4/0 nylon monoﬁlament with a blunted tip was inserted into
the left ICA via the opening of the left CCA until a mild resistance
was felt [11]. At this point, the intraluminal suture totally blocked
the origin of the middle cerebral artery. The rat was kept in a single
nursing cage for 24-hour recovery period.

Data were analyzed with the statistical package of social sciences software (SPSS) version 16.0. The mNSS were analyzed using
Kruskal–Wallis followed by Mann Whitney test. One-way analysis
of variances (ANOVA) followed by Tukey–Kramer multiple comparisons test were used to analyze the motor impairments, infarct
volumes and NSE levels. Differences at P < 0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

2.4. Neurological deﬁcits
2.4.1. Evaluation of modiﬁed neurological severity scores
All rats were subjected to modiﬁed neurological severity scores
(mNSS) behavioral test after 2 h of MCAO. mNSS is a scoring system
and consists of 14 abnormal observations due to either inability to
perform the task correctly in motor (muscle status and abnormal
movement), sensory (visual, tactile and proprioceptive) and balance tests; or for the lacked in a tested reﬂex test [12]. One point was

3. Results
3.1. Neurological deﬁcits
The mNSS was highest in the control rats which indicated
that there were motor and somatosensory dysfunctions. These
dysfunctions reﬂected that there were ischemic injuries to the
caudoputamen and frontoparietal cortex. Both areas receive their
blood supply from middle cerebral artery and are important in
motor, perceptual, cognitive skill and spatial task [18–21]. There
was signiﬁcant reduction for mNSS (P = 0.005) in 1 ␮M (S)-3,5DHPG pretreated rats, while there was no signiﬁcance difference
for 10 and 100 ␮M (S)-3,5-DHPG pretreated when compared to
the control rats (Fig. 1). The control ischemic rats demonstrated
more errors in the right limbs as compared to the left limbs during

the GWT. There was signiﬁcant reduction in motor impairment in
the right limbs of 1 ␮M (P = 0.004) and 10 ␮M (P = 0.038) (S)-3,5DHPG pretreated as compared to the control rats (Fig. 2). In contrast,
there was no signiﬁcant difference in motor impairment between
100 ␮M (S)-3,5-DHPG pretreated as compared to the control rats.
No signiﬁcant difference observed in the left limbs across all groups
(P > 0.05) (Fig. 2).
3.2. Infarct volume
The cortical and striatal infarction areas were evident in all rats,
which indicated the injury due to MCAO (Fig. 3a). There were signiﬁcant reductions in infarct volume of 1 and 10 ␮M (S)-3,5-DHPG
pretreated rats (P < 0.01) whilst no signiﬁcant difference in 100 ␮M
(S)-3,5-DHPG pretreated when compared to control rats (Fig. 3b).
3.3. NSE level
NSE is a biomarker for brain damages commonly used in animal and human studies [22–25]. The control rats exhibited the
highest mean of NSE level (6.26 ng/ml) when compared with the
(S)-3,5-DHPG pretreated rats. There was signiﬁcant reduction in
NSE level in 1 ␮M (P < 0.01) and 10 ␮M (P < 0.05) (S)-3,5-DHPG pretreated when compared to control rats (Fig. 4). However, there was
no signiﬁcant different in NSE level between 100 ␮M (S)-3,5-DHPG
pretreated and control rats (Fig. 4).
4. Discussion
The present work showed that pretreatment with 1 and 10 ␮M
of (S)-3,5-DHPG were signiﬁcantly reduced the severity of ischemic
injury as compared to the 100 ␮M of (S)-3,5-DHPG. This study
demonstrated the preconditioning effect of (S)-3,5-DHPG in anticipating as a potential preventative agent in reducing the ischemic
induced neuronal damage. Preconditioning involves initial treatment that resulted in subsequent resistance to ischemia (tolerance)
or with other stressors. Neurological deﬁcits were observed in the
right limb which as expected, contralateral to the lesion site i.e.,
left MCAO. The neurological deﬁcits of the right limb were signiﬁcantly improved by 1 ␮M (S)-3,5-DHPG preconditioning. These
observations were consistent with previous studies that indicated
that small doses of chemical agents exert neuroprotection [26–30].
Interestingly, 10 ␮M (S)-3,5-DHPG improved the motor impairments but no change in the mNSS. This is probably due to sensitivity
of grid walking test in assessing the extent of weakened contralat-

eral paretic side of the stroke rats. The mNSS administers simple
motor, sensory, reﬂex and balance tasks and involves an overall
composite score to assess multiple deﬁcits. Hence, the signiﬁcant
improvements by 10 ␮M (S)-3,5-DHPG may be masked by deﬁcits
in other modalities. One can argue that these observed neurological
improvements may due to the fact that at high dose, (S)-3,5-DHPG
alone induced hyper locomotion activities including fast walking
[31]. Nevertheless, this argument may forfeited as there was no
signiﬁcant improvements in neurological deﬁcits after the 100 ␮M
(S)-3,5-DHPG preconditioning.
The improvements in motor impairments were correlated
with the reduction in infarct volumes of 1 and 10 ␮M (S)-3,5DHPG but not 100 ␮M (S)-3,5-DHPG preconditioning. TTC stains
the healthy neurons by the reducing process of tetrazolium
compound by oxidative enzymes which turning it to red-colored
1,3,5-triphenylformazan. The occurrence of this reaction indicates
the presence of cellular respiration by the metabolically active tissues [14]. In ischaemic brain tissue, the cellular respiration is not
occurred, leaving the tissue white pale in color. We demonstrated
that the lesser the infarct volume, the lesser the neurological damage. The most consistent pattern of cell death in MCAO is early
infarction of the striatum that progress to delayed infarction of the
dorsolateral cortex [21]. The core ischemic damage is known to
be irreversible. Neuroprotection involves salvaging the ischemic
penumbra area i.e., the dorsolateral cortex. As shown by the representative of brain slices, 1 and 10 ␮M DHPG pretreated rats showed
limited infarct size which involved mainly the striatum.
These observations are consistent with the serum NSE of 1 ␮M
and 10 ␮M (S)-3,5-DHPG preconditioning which were signiﬁcantly
lower than in the untreated stroke rats. It has been proposed
that necrosis, apoptosis and ischemic preconditioning shared similar initial signaling pathway which depend on the intensity of
an ischemic insult that being posed to the brain [32,33]. The
reduction of brain damages in 1 and 10 ␮M (S)-3,5-DHPG preconditioning has been evidenced by other studies that suggested
medium intensity of a stimulus commits the pathway to programmed cell protection. Where else, maximum intensity leads
to necrosis and submaximal intensity leads to apoptosis [34–36].
In comparison, the application of 1 ␮M S-3,5-DHPG to hippocampal cell cultures 2 h prior to NMDA exposure did not signiﬁcantly
reduced PI uptake [7]. Conversely, application of 10 and 100 ␮M
(S)-3,5-DHPG showed reduction in PI uptake and decreased in
NDMA stimulated inward currents. Although those dose dependency effects of (S)-3,5-DHPG are discordant with the present
study, it is important to highlight that the differences may be
due to the involvement the whole sequel of the ischemic cascade
along with interactions of hormonal, vascular and immune systems [35]. Despite the complexity of their downstream signalling
mechanisms, Group I mGluRs have been studied in vivo as potential agents in managing neurological disorders [37]. Application of
glutamate on in vivo model as a model of injury may worsen the
outcome of stroke. Furthermore, using (S)-3,5-DHPG may be useful
as a cognitive enhancing agent in memory impairment associated
with ischemia or hypoxia.
Previous in vivo studies indicated that group I mGluRs mediates neurodegeneration by increasing the release of glutamate,
the intracellular storage of calcium and the excitation of neurons
[38]. On the other hand, activation of group I mGluRs enhance
mGluRI-Homer-PIKE-L complex formations which in turn activate
neuroprotection activities via the PI3 -K Akt pathways, consequently preventing neuronal apoptosis [39]. These phenomena
were clariﬁed in vitro, whereby in the neuronal-glial cell cultures,
the Group I mGluRs exacerbates the necrotic injury while attenuate
apoptosis [40]. Therefore, understanding of mechanisms underlying the preconditioning effect of (S)-3,5-DHPG is a critical point of
salvation in this area.

5. Conclusion
We demonstrated the preconditioning effects of 1 and 10 ␮M of
(S)-3,5-DHPG which neuroprotective against subsequent ischemic
insult in the middle cererebral artery occluded rats. These observations signify the roles of Group I mGluRs activation in inducing
intrinsic molecular mechanism of neuroprotection in the central
nervous system.
