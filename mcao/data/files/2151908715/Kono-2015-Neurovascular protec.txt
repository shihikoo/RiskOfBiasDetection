Telmisartan is a highly lipid-soluble angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), which
improves insulin sensitivity and reduces triglyceride levels and, thus, is called
metabo-sartan. We examined the effects of telmisartan on neurovascular unit
(N-acetylglucosamine oligomer [NAGO], collagen IV, and glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and neuroinflammation (matrix metalloproteinase-9 [MMP-9] and
inflammasome) in brain of stroke-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rat
(SHR-SR). At 12 weeks of age, SHR-SR received transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 90 minutes and were divided into the following 3 groups, that
is, vehicle group, low-dose telmisartan group (.3 mg/kg/d), and high-dose telmisartan group (3 mg/kg/d, postoral). Immunohistologic analysis at ages 6, 12, and
18 months showed progressive decreases of NAGO-positive endothelium and
collagen IV–positive basement membrane and progressive increases of MMP-9–
positive neurons, GFAP-positive astrocytes, and NLRP3-positive inflammasome in
the cerebral cortex of vehicle group. Low-dose telmisartan reduced such changes
without lowering blood pressure (BP), and high-dose telmisartan further improved
such changes with lowering BP. The present findings suggest that a persistent
hypertension caused a long-lasting inflammation after tMCAO in SHR-SR, which
accelerated neurovascular disruption and emergent inflammasome, and that
telmisartan greatly reduced such inflammation and protected the neurovascular
unit via its pleiotropic effects in living hypertensive rat brain after ischemic
stroke. Key Words: Spontaneously hypertensive rat—neurovascular unit—
inflammasome—telmisartan—Alzheimer disease.

Previous studies demonstrated that the SHR developed
insulin resistance4 and several risk factors for Alzheimer
disease (AD).5
Some clinical trials reported that the effect of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers showed primary
and secondary preventions of cerebral infarction.6-9
Treatment of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has
been shown to reduce stroke volume and improve
neurologic function through their blockade of the renin–
angiotensin system in experimental stroke model.10-15
Although the antihypertensive effect of ARBs are one of
the mechanisms of preventing cerebral infarction, ARBs
have a blood pressure–independent neuroprotection
with reducing oxidative stress and upregulating angiotensin II type 2 signaling.16-23
Telmisartan is a highly lipid-soluble AT1 receptor
blocker24,25 and is a partial agonistic effect on peroxisome
proliferator–activated receptor gamma, which improves
insulin sensitivity and reduces triglyceride levels26-28
and, thus, is called metabo-sartan to exert a special protective effect for both acute brain damage and chronic
progressive dementia.29,30 There has been, however, no
study on the long-term effects of telmisartan on both protection of the neurovascular unit and reduction of inflammation after stroke. We, therefore, examined the effects
of telmisartan on SHR-SR with transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (tMCAO) by both doses with effect of
antimetabolic mechanism, that is, a low dose without
lowering blood pressure and a high dose with lowering
hypertension.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Seven-week-old male SHR-SRs were provided from
Disease Model Cooperative Research Association (Kyoto,
Japan) and placed on a basal diet. Animals were maintained for at least 7 days before the experiment in a
temperature-regulated room (23 C-25 C) on a 12-hour
light/dark cycle. The rats were fasted but allowed free
access to water overnight before surgery.

MCA. During these procedures, body temperature was
monitored with a rectal probe and was maintained at
37 6 .3 C using a heating pad. The surgical incision was
then closed, and the animals were allowed to recover at
room temperature. After 90 minutes of tMCAO, the suture was removed to restore blood flow (reperfusion).
Sham control animals were treated with cervical surgery
but without insertion of the nylon thread. The animals
were kept at ambient temperature until sampling, with
free access to water and food.

Drug Preparation
On the day of tMCAO at 12 weeks, the above SHR-SR
(n 5 51) were divided into the following 3 groups after
tMCAO, that is, SHR-SR vehicle group (SHR/Ve,
n 5 19), SHR-SR low-dose telmisartan group in which
the blood pressure did not fall (SHR/Low, n 5 16), and
SHR-SR high-dose telmisartan group in which the blood
pressure significantly fell by 30 mm Hg or more (SHR/
High, n 5 16), receiving daily oral doses of .5% methylcellulose (MC, 0.1 mL) only (SHR/Ve group), .5% MC plus
low-dose telmisartan (0.3 mg/kg/d), or .5% MC plus
high-dose telmisartan (3 mg/kg/d) for the subsequent
3, 9, and 15 months until sacrifice by oral gavage, respectively. The dose of telmisartan was determined as
previously described.32,33 Telmisartan was provided by
Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany)
and was given to the 2 rat groups as a suspension with
5% MC in 0.1 mL water every day.
At ages 6, 12, or 18 months, the rats were transcardially
perfused with 5 U/mL chilled heparinized saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer
(pH 7.6) under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital
(20 mg/250 g rat). After decapitaion, their brains were
removed. All experimental procedures were approved
by the Animal Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama University. The present
study focused on neurovascular unit components and
inflammasome in a whole project in the examination of
effect of telmisartan on SHR-SR.

Immunohistochemistry
Ischemia/Reperfusion Model
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in
SHR-SR by right MCAO at 12 weeks of age (body weight
260-280 g). Briefly, the SHR-SR were anesthetized by inhalation of a 69%/30% (vol/vol) mixture of nitrous oxide/
oxygen with 1% halothane using a face mask. A midline
neck incision was made, and the right common carotid
artery was exposed. The right MCA was occluded by
insertion of 4-0 surgical nylon thread with a silicone
coating through the common carotid artery immediately
after ligation of the ipsilateral common and external
carotid arteries as described previously.31 Using this technique, the tip of the thread occludes the origin of the right

After the removal, the brains were immersed and fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde with .1 M phosphate buffer (pH
7.6) for 8 hours, embedded in paraffin, and 5-mm-thick
sections were prepared for subsequent immunostaining.
For N-acetylglucosamine oligomer (NAGO), which was
used as the specific endothelial cell marker,34 collagen
IV, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP), and nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain–like receptor family, pyrin domain–
containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, the brain sections
were pretreated by heating them 3 times in a 500-W
microwave for 5 minutes in 10 mM (pH 6.0) citric acid
buffer. These pretreated sections were then immersed in

NEUROVASCULAR PROTECTION BY TELMISARTAN IN SHR WITH TMCAO

.5% periodic acid to block intrinsic peroxidase and treated
with 5% normal horse serum in 50 mM phosphatebuffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing .05% Tween 20
to block any nonspecific antibody response and were
finally incubated overnight with each primary antibody.
The following primary antibodies were used in this
study: monoclonal rabbit anti-collagen IV antibody
(20441, 1:100; Novotec, Lyon, France), polyclonal rabbit
anti-MMP-9 antibody (AB19016, 1:100; Millipore, Billerica, MA), polyclonal rabbit anti-GFAP antibody (Z0334,
1:200; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and polyclonal goat
anti-NLRP3 antibody (LS-B1766, 1:200; LSBio, Seattle,
WA). A biotinylated antimouse antibody for MMP-9,
collagen IV, GFAP, and Lycopersicon esculentum lectin
(1:500; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), which
binds NAGO was used as the secondary antibody, and
specific labeling was visualized by a Vectastain Elite
ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). To guarantee specific staining primary antibodies, a set of brain sections was also
stained without primary antibodies.

Detection and Analyses
The above stained sections were digitized with a digital
microscope camera (Olympus BX-51; Olympus Optical
Co., Tokyo, Japan). For analyses of pixel intensity of
NAGO-positive endothelium and collagen IV–positive
basement membrane, the sizes of the images were kept
the same under all conditions, and the images were
analyzed using Scion Imaging Software (Scion, Frederick,
MD). This assessment was achieved by randomly
choosing 4 cortex areas around the ischemic core whose
tissues have shed (peri-ischemic lesion) in each section
at the level of basal ganglia in each rat. The pixel measurement and analysis functions were used for counting the
density-sliced area in the image of the cerebral cortex at
right peri-ischemic lesion (ipsilateral) side. And the
numbers of MMP-9–positive neurons, GFAP-positive
astrocytes, and NLRP-positive cells per each 1 mm2 in
hemispheric coronal sections were counted at right periischemic lesion (ipsilateral) side.
Data are expressed as mean 6 standard deviation. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance with repeated measures (multiple comparisons).
Planned comparisons were used for Tukey–Kramer post
hoc analysis. P less than .05 was considered significant.
All statistical analyses were performed with Statcel statistical package (Statcel two; OMS Inc., Tokorozawa, Japan).

Double Immunofluorescence Staining
To define the cellular source of MMP-9–positive
cell, sections were incubated with a mixture of monoclonal mouse anti-MMP-9 (DFK-F-69-EX, 1:100; Cosmobio, Tokyo, Japan) and polyclonal rabbit anti-MAP-2
(AB5622, 1:100; Millipore) antibodies. For simultaneous
detection of NLRP3-positive cell, sections were incubated

539

with a mixture of monoclonal mouse anti-NLRP3
(AG-20B-0014, 1:200; Adipogen, San Diego, CA) and
polyclonal rabbit anti-ionized calcium-binding adaptor
molecule 1 (Iba1) (019-19741, 1:200; Wako, Osaka, Japan)
antibodies overnight at 4 C. After rinsing in PBS, the sections were incubated with appropriate Alexa Fluor–
conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500; A21424 and
A11034; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 2 hours at room
temperature. Finally, the sections were thoroughly
washed by PBS and then coverslipped with antifading
mounting media with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
used for nuclear counterstaining (Vector Laboratories).
A confocal microscope equipped with argon and HeNe1
lasers (Zeiss, LSM 510, Jena, Germany) was used to capture fluorescent images.

Results
Blood Pressure in the 3 SHR-SR Groups
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) showed no significant difference among all 3 SHR-SR groups at 3 months of age.
SHR-SR/High group maintained a significantly lower
SBP than the SHR-SR/Ve group at 6, 12, and 18 months
(P , .05). Diastolic blood pressure showed a similar
decrease in SBP (P , .01), but HR showed no significant
differences among all 3 groups. In the present study, we
used part of the animal samples from another study.35

NAGO Staining in the Cerebral Cortex
The endothelial marker NAGO was detected in the cerebral cortex of ipsilateral side at ages 6, 12, and 18 months
for all 3 rat groups (Fig 1, A). In the SHR/Ve group, quantitative analysis of the pixel intensity of NAGO endothelium showed decreases in the cerebral cortex at 12
(91.5 6 32.6%) and 18 (50.3 6 25.0%) months compared
with 6 months (100%, Fig 1, Aa), respectively (Fig 1, B).
In the 2 telmisartan groups, quantitative analysis of the
NAGO-positive endothelium recovered at 6, 12, and
18 months (Fig 1, A). The pixel intensity relative to the
6-month SHR/Ve group in cerebral cortex proved such recovery to 184.8 6 91.2% at 6 months, 157.3 6 37.3% at
12 months (*P , .05 versus SHR/Ve group at 12 months),
and 148.9 6 22.3% at 18 months (*P , .05 versus SHR/Ve
group at 18 months) in the SHR/Low group and
204.8 6 41.3% at 6 months, 168.6 6 28.0% at 12 months
(**P , .01 versus SHR/Ve group at 12 months), and
175.7 6 74.6% at 18 months (**P , .01 versus SHR/Ve
group at 18 months) in the SHR/High group (Fig 1, B).
Although NAGO staining in contralateral side was with
similar intensity, the changes were little compared with
that in ipsilateral side.

groups (Fig 2, A). In the SHR/Ve group, the pixel intensity relative to 6 months were 141.0 6 8.8% at 12 months
and 137.0 6 22.5% at 18 months, respectively (Fig 2, B).
In the 2 telmisartan groups, collagen IV pixel intensity
recovered at 6, 12, and 18 months (Fig 2, A). The pixel intensity relative to the 6 months SHR/Ve group in cerebral
cortex proved such recovery to 156.9 6 3.8% at 6 months,
260.4 6 15.7% at 12 months (**P , .01 versus SHR/Ve
group at 12 months), and 207.6 6 20.7% at 18 months
(*P , .05 versus SHR/Ve group at 18 months) in the
SHR/Low group and 222.1 6 3.5% at 6 months
(*P , .05 versus SHR/Ve group at 6 months), 291.1 6
48.7% at 12 months (**P , .01 versus SHR/Ve group at
12 months), and 267.6 6 45.5% at 18 months (**P , .01
versus SHR/Ve group at 18 months, #P , .05 versus
SHR/Low group at 18 months) in the SHR/High group
(Fig 2, B). Although collagen IV staining in contralateral
side was with similar intensity, the changes were little
compared with that in ipsilateral side.

the SHR/Ve group, the mean numbers of GFAP-positive
astrocytes in 1 mm2 of cerebral cortex showed gradual increases in the cerebral cortex at 12 months (198.8 6 56.0)
and 18 months (199.2 6 46.8) compared with 6 months
(143.3 6 78.8, Fig 4, Aa), respectively (Fig 4, B).
In the 2 telmisartan groups, GFAP-positive astrocytes in
the cerebral cortex showed a great improvement with
ages at 12 and 18 months (Fig 4, Ae, f, h, and i). The number of GFAP-positive astrocytes in 1 mm2 of cerebral cortex in the SHR/Low group was 96.1 6 34.3 at 6 months,
102.3 6 22.5 at 12 months (**P ,.01 versus SHR/Ve group
at 12 months), and 146.6 6 37.2 at 18 months (*P , .05
versus SHR/Ve group at 18 months) and those in the
SHR/High group was 64.5 6 18.1 at 6 months,
95.5 6 26.6 at 12 months (**P , .01 versus SHR/Ve group
at 12 months), and 121.5 6 31.2 at 18 months (**P , .01
versus SHR/Ve group at 18 months; Fig 4, B). Although
GFAP staining in contralateral side was with similar
intensity, the changes were little compared with that in
ipsilateral side.

MMP-9 Staining in the Cerebral Cortex
Contrary to NAGO and collagen IV, MMP-9 was
evidently labeled in cerebral cortical neurons of SHR/Ve
group of ipsilateral side at 6 months (Fig 3, Aa), and it
became stronger at 12 and 18 months (Fig 3, Ad and g).
Quantitative analysis showed that the mean numbers of
MMP-9–positive neurons in 1 mm2 of cerebral cortex
were 174.8 6 31.8 at 6 months, 197.5 6 84.5 at 12 months,
and 242.3 6 72.8 at 18 months, respectively (Fig 3, B).
On the other hand, MMP-9–positive neurons showed
great improvements in the cerebral cortex of the 2 telmisartan groups at 6-18 months (Fig 3, Ab, c, e, f, h, and i).
Thus, the number of MMP-9–positive neurons in 1 mm2
of cerebral cortex in the SHR/Low group was
81.6 6 24.2 at 6 months (**P , .01 versus SHR/Ve group
at 6 months), 79.0 6 20.3 at 12 months (*P , .05 versus
SHR/Ve group at 12 months), and 111.7 6 49.5 at
18 months (**P , .01 versus SHR/Ve group at 18 months)
and those in the SHR/High group was 72.6 6 37.3 at
6 months (**P , .01 versus SHR/Ve group at 6M),
75.1 6 8.5 at 12 months (*P , .05 vs SHR/Ve group at
12 months), and 99.8 6 38.8 at 18 months (**P ,.01 versus
SHR/Ve group at 18 months; Fig 3, B). Although MMP-9
staining in contralateral side was with similar intensity, the changes were little compared with that in
ipsilateral side.
Double immunostaining showed that MMP-9 was
mainly expressed in MAP-2–positive neuron and not
in other cell types including Iba1-positive microglia
(Fig 3, C).

GFAP Staining in the Cerebral Cortex
Similar to MMP-9, GFAP-positive astrocytes in the cerebral cortex of ipsilateral side increased with age in SHR/
Ve group from 6 to 12-18 months (Fig 4, Aa, d, and g). In

NLRP3 Staining
In SHR/Ve group, NLRP3 was clearly labeled in ipsilateral side at 6 months (Fig 5, Aa), and it became stronger at
12 and 18 months (Fig 5, A, d, and g). Quantitative analysis showed that the mean numbers of NLRP3-positive
cells in 1 mm2 were 64.7 6 19.0 at 6 months, 68.0 6 19.4
at 12 months, and 92.6 6 18.2 at 18 months, respectively
(Fig 5, B).
In the 2 telmisartan groups, NLRP3-positive cells
showed strong improvements at 6-18 months (Fig 5, Ac,
f, h, and i). Thus, the number of NLRP3-positive cells
per 1 mm2 in the SHR/Low group was 40.5 6 14.2 at
6 months, 53.7 6 23.5 at 12 months, and 55.1 6 22.0 at
18 months (*P , .05 versus SHR/Ve group at 18 months)
and those in the SHR/High group was 29.3 6 68.8
(*P , .05 versus SHR/Ve group at 6M) at 6 months,
28.4 6 12.4 at 12 months (*P , .05 versus SHR/Ve group
at 12 months), and 38.2 6 15.1 at 18 months (**P , .01
versus SHR/Ve group at 18 months; Fig 5, B). Although
NLRP3 staining in contralateral side was with similar
intensity, the changes were little compared with that in
ipsilateral side.
Double immunostaining showed that NLRP3 was
mainly expressed in Iba1-positive microglia and not in
other cell types (Fig 5, C).

Discussion
The present study investigated the long-term change of
neurovascular unit in the cerebral cortex of SHR-SR after
tMCAO (Figs 1-5). The results demonstrated progressive
decreases of NAGO-positive endothelium (Fig 1) and
collagen IV–positive basement membrane (Fig 2) and progressive increases of MMP-9–positive neurons (Fig 3),
GFAP-positive astrocytes (Fig 4), and NLRP3-positive

inflammasome (Fig 5) with aging in the cerebral cortex of
hypertensive rats (SHR/Ve). The present study also
showed that low-dose telmisartan (SHR/Low) reduced
such changes without lowering blood pressure and that
high-dose telmisartan (SHR/High) further improved
such changes with lowering blood pressure.
A number of animal studies suggested the beneficial
effects of ARBs in stroke including a blood pressure–
independent neuroprotection and other underlying
molecular mechanisms.16-23 According to these reports,
ARBs reduced oxidative stress and showed a neuroprotective effects by reducing AT1 receptor signaling
with upregulating type 2 signaling. Thus, previous
reports showed that administration of ARBs significantly suppressed ischemic brain injury without
inducing a significant change in blood pressure, indicating the advantages of ARBs beyond their effects on
blood pressure.
Ischemia and reperfusion cause deterioration of cerebral microvascular basal lamina, especially collagen IV
with activating MMP-9 by reactive oxygen species.36-38
In addition, an in vitro study showed a correlation
between endothelial cell death and extracellular matrix
disruption by MMP activation.39,40
Angiotensin 2 stimulates expression of MMPs,41-43 and
an ARB, irbesartan, stabilized carotid plaque stabilization
by inhibiting MMPs in human patients.44 Treatment with
telmisartan also reduced inflammatory responses
including the expression of MMP-9 in the periodontal
tissue of a rat model.45 Our present data first revealed
maintaining neurovascular unit components (NAGO
and collagen IV) with reducing inflammatory responses
of MMP-9 and GFAP of SHR-SR rat brain by telmisartan
(Figs 1-4). Thus, telmisartan also showed direct antiinflammatory effects on hypertensive rat brain after
stroke because of only a little additive effect of highdose telmisartan from low dose (Fig 2, 18 months).
In the present study, we also focused on NLRP3 inflammasome, a key component of the innate immune system,
which facilitates caspase-1 and interleukin 1b processing,
amplifies inflammatory crystals and protein aggregating,
and finally promoting amyloid-b deposition in AD.46,47
The NLRP3/caspase-1 axis plays an important role for
the pathogenesis of AD, and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition suggests a new therapeutic intervention for the disease.48 Our present study showed a marked activation of
NLRP3 inflammasome in the peri-ischemic lesion of hypertensive rats, which was dramatically improved in
the dose-dependent telmisartan groups (Fig 5). Combined
with our previous report where telmisartan greatly
reduced amyloid-b deposit both inside and outside nerve
cells,35 telmisartan might show preventive effect for postischemic brain to develop AD pathology with reducing
NLRP3 inflammasome.
In summary, the present findings suggest that a persistent hypertension caused a long-lasting inflammation

after tMCAO in SHR-SR, which accelerated neurovascular disruption and emergent inflammasome, and that
telmisartan greatly reduced such inflammation and protected the neurovascular unit via its pleiotropic effects
in living hypertensive rat brain after stroke.
