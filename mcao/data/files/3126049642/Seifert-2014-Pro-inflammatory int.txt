Abstract The delayed immune response to stroke is responsible for the increased neural injury that continues to occur
after the initial ischemic event. This delayed immune response
has been linked to the spleen, as splenectomy prior to middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is neuroprotective. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) is linked to the splenic response, which
enhances neural injury following MCAO. IFNγ activates the
expression of the inflammatory chemokine interferoninducible protein 10 (IP-10). This study was designed to
determine the role of IFNγ signaling in the inflammatory
response following MCAO. Expression of IP-10 increased
in the brain and the spleen following MCAO. Splenectomy
inhibited the increase of IP-10 in the brain post-MCAO, while
recombinant IFNγ administration to splenectomized rats
returned IP-10 levels in the brain to levels found in rats after
MCAO only. Systemic administration of an IFNγ neutralizing
antibody to MCAO-treated rats reduced infarct volume and
IP-10 levels in the brain. T cell infiltration was reduced in the
MCAO-damaged brains of IFNγ antibody-treated animals
relative to those that received isotype control antibodies. Additionally, inhibiting IFNγ signaling with splenectomy or an
IFNγ neutralizing antibody blocked the induction of IP-10
expression and decreased neurodegeneration following

Introduction
The inflammatory response after stroke has been well documented in enhancing delayed neurodegeneration after ischemic injury (Leonardo and Pennypacker 2011). Downstream
signaling of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma
(IFNγ) induces the expression of the chemokine interferoninducible protein 10 (IP-10), also known as CXCL10. IP-10 is
a pro-inflammatory chemokine that selectively drives the
propagation of the Th1 response by interacting with the
CXCR3 receptor (Loetscher et al. 2001). Microglia/
macrophages produce IP-10 in response to IFNγ stimulation
(Luster 2002), and IP-10 induces chemotaxis of Th1 cells to
the site of injury. In addition, IP-10 can prevent the activation
of Th2 cells by competitive antagonism of the CCR3 receptor
(Loetscher et al. 2001). These interactions of IP-10 with
CXCR3 and CCR3 create a pro-inflammatory feed forward
mechanism that effectively recruits more IFNγ producing
cells to the site of injury, leading to more IP-10 production
through increased IFNγ signaling.
Investigations of IP-10 in experimental mouse models
of stroke have shown that IP-10 mRNA is upregulated
early in the brain at 6 and 22 h following MCAO. In the
spleen, IP-10 mRNA levels are increased at 22 h postMCAO (Offner et al. 2006; Hurn et al. 2007). Although
IP-10 transcript has been measured at selected time points
following stroke, IP-10 protein levels have not been quantified in the brain or spleen following MCAO or at longer
time points after MCAO. Further investigation into the

680

role of IP-10 following brain ischemia is necessary to
elucidate the IFNγ/T cell response in stroke.
The contribution of the peripheral immune response to
ischemic stroke injury has been directly linked to the spleen,
and IFNγ signaling appears to play a key role in strokeinduced neurodegeneration. The spleen is a large reservoir
for immune cells and splenectomy prior to middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) is neuroprotective in rats (Ajmo
et al. 2008) and mice (Jin et al. 2013). IFNγ is a proinflammatory cytokine that relays the splenic response to
MCAO. IFNγ levels increase in the spleen 24 h postMCAO (Seifert et al. 2012b), and are upregulated in the
injured brain at 72 h post-MCAO in rats (Seifert et al.
2012b) and mice (Jin et al. 2013). Interestingly, splenectomy
prior to MCAO blocks post-stroke IFNγ elevations in the
brain (Seifert et al. 2012b; Jin et al. 2013), and administration of recombinant IFNγ to splenectomized rats negates the protective effects of splenectomy. These data
demonstrate that spleen-derived IFNγ plays a detrimental
role following stroke.
Since splenocytes have also been tracked in vivo and were
found to migrate to the injured brain after MCAO (Seifert
et al. 2012a), we have been investigating the downstream
effects of IFNγ signaling that may be responsible for promoting degenerative injury following stroke. Previous studies
have demonstrated increased levels of IFNγ, the main inducer
of IP-10 synthesis, in the brain (Seifert et al. 2012b; Jin et al.
2013) and the spleen (Seifert et al. 2012b) post-MCAO. In this
study, we assessed the time course of IP-10 expression in the
spleen and brain after MCAO to determine whether IP-10 is a
critical mediator of the peripheral immune response following
stroke. Splenectomy and/or administration of an IFNγ neutralizing antibody were utilized to inhibit IFNγ signaling.
Results showed that blocking IFNγ signaling effectively reduced IP-10 expression and decreased neural injury following
stroke. T cell recruitment to the brain was also investigated, as
IP-10 is a chemoattractant for Th1 cells, and decreased IP-10
protein expression was associated with diminished T cell
infiltration into the infarct. These data indicate that IFNγ/IP10 is a major inflammatory signal pathway in the immune
response to stroke.

(Indianapolis, IN), maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle
(6 am–6 pm) and given access to food and water ad libitum.
Laser Doppler Blood Flow Measurement
Laser Doppler was used to monitor blood perfusion (Moor
Instruments Ltd, Devon, England). A hole was drilled 1 mm
posterior and 4 mm lateral from Bregma, and a guide screw
was placed. The laser doppler probe was inserted into the
guide screw, and the tip of the probe was placed against the
surface of the brain. Rats that did not show ≥60 % reduction in
perfusion during MCAO were excluded from this study
(Ajmo et al. 2006; Ajmo et al. 2008; Hall et al. 2009). Sham
operated rats had the guide screw and laser doppler probe
placed and blood flow was monitored to ensure that there was
not a drop in cerebral blood flow during the sham procedure.
Splenectomy
Splenectomy was performed 2 weeks prior to MCAO as
previously described (Seifert et al. 2012b). Briefly, rats were
anesthetized with 5 % isoflurane and maintained on 2–3 %.
The abdominal cavity was opened on the anatomical left. The
splenic blood vessels were ligated and the spleen was removed. The incision was then closed with sutures, first closing
the abdominal wall and then the skin incision. Sham operations were also performed where the spleen was exteriorized
and then reinserted into the cavity. Animals were allowed to
wake in fresh cages.
Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion

Materials and Methods

MCAO surgery was performed using the intraluminal method
originally described by Longa et al. (Longa et al. 1989) and
previously reported (Ajmo et al. 2006; Ajmo et al. 2008; Hall
et al. 2009). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with 5 % isoflurane
and maintained on 2–3 %. Blunt dissection was performed to
isolate the common carotid artery, the internal carotid artery
(ICA), and the external carotid artery (ECA). The ECA was
ligated and cut. Then a 40 mm monofilament was introduced
into the ECA, fed distally into the ICA, and advanced to the
origin of the MCA. The filament was tied off on the ECA to
produce a permanent occlusion. The incision was then sutured
closed and the rat was allowed to wake in a fresh cage.

Animal Care

Antibody Treatment Injections

All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the
NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals with a
protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the University of South Florida. Male Sprague–
Dawley rats (300–350 g) were used for the following experiments. All rats were purchased from Harlan Labs

A goat anti-rat polyclonal IFNγ neutralizing antibody (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and a goat IgG isotype antibody
(R&D Systems) were reconstituted with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) to a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Animals in the
antibody treatment study were randomly assigned to one of
three treatment groups: IFNγ neutralizing antibody, IgG

J Neuroimmune Pharmacol (2014) 9:679–689

isotype control or the PBS control. Beginning at 24 h postMCAO animals were administered either 5 μg (0.05 ml) of a
goat anti-rat IFNγ neutralizing antibody, a goat IgG isotype
control, or an equivalent amount of PBS via an intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection. Treatment was administered at 24, 48, and 72 h
post-MCAO.
Recombinant IFNγ Administration
Rat recombinant IFNγ (rIFNγ) was administered as previously described (Seifert et al. 2012b). The lowest dosage of rIFNγ
(ProSpec, Rehovot, Israel) that elicited a physiologic response
in naïve rats was previously determined. The dosage of 20 μg
(in 0.21 ml sterile ddH2O) was injected intravenously (i.v.),
via the tail vein, at 48 and 72 h post-MCAO to determine the
effects of IFNγ on neural injury in splenectomized and shamsplenectomized rats.
Tissue Extraction and Sectioning
The animals were euthanatized with a ketamine/xylazine mix,
75 and 7.5 mg/kg respectively, i.p. at 24, 48, 72 or 96 h postMCAO for the time course experiment and at 96 h postMCAO for the antibody treatment and rIFNγ experiments.
Anesthetized animals were then perfused transcardially with
0.9 % saline followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate
buffer (PB). The spleen and thymus were removed prior to
perfusion. Spleens were weighed immediately following removal and were subsequently snap frozen and stored in the
−80 °C with the thymi. The brains were harvested, post fixed
in 4 % paraformaldehyde, and immersed in 20 % followed by
30 % sucrose in PBS. Brains were frozen and sliced into
30 μm sections using a cryostat. Coronal sections were taken
at six points from 1.7 to–3.3 mm from Bregma. Sections were
either thaw mounted on glass slides or placed in Walter’s Antifreeze cryopreservative and stored at −20 °C.
Fluoro-Jade Staining
Brain sections mounted on glass slides were stained with
Fluoro-Jade, which labels degenerating neurons. This method
was adapted from that originally developed by Schmued et al.
(Schmued et al. 1997) and has been described by Duckworth
et al. (Duckworth et al. 2005). Slides were dried at room
temperature overnight, placed in 100 % ethanol for 3 min,
70 % ethanol for 1 min, and then ddH2O for 1 min. Slides
were oxidized using a 0.06 % KMnO4 solution for 15 min
followed by three 1 min rinses with ddH2O. Slides were
stained in a 0.001 % solution of Fluoro-Jade (Histochem,
Jefferson, AR) in 0.1 % acetic acid in the dark for 30 min.
Slides then were rinsed 4 times with ddH2O for 3 min each
time, allowed to dry at 45 °C for 20 min, cleared twice with

681

xylene and then cover slipped with DPX mounting medium
(Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA).
Infarct Quantification
Fluoro-Jade stained tissue was digitally photographed with
Zeiss Axioskop2 (Carl Zeiss Inc, Thornwood, NY) microscope controlled by Openlab software (Improvision, Waltham, MA) at a magnification of 1x. The area of neurodegeneration was measured using the NIH ImageJ software. The
area of the contralateral hemisphere was also measured and
used to compensate for possible edema in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Infarct volumes were then calculated by the total area
of ipsilateral staining divided by the total contralateral area for
a given animal. Infarct quantification was done for all animals.
Immunohistochemistry in the Brain
The slides were dried at 37 °C for 1 h then rinsed with PBS
pH 7.4. Slides were placed in permeabilization buffer containing 10 % serum, 3 % 1 M lysine, and 0.3 % Triton X-100 in
PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Next, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a primary antibody solution (PBS
with 2 % serum and 0.3 % Triton X-100) in a humidified
chamber. Slides were subsequently rinsed with PBS and incubated with a secondary antibody solution (PBS, 2 % serum,
0.3 % Triton X-100) for 1 h. Slides were washed thoroughly
with PBS and dried for 1 h at 45 °C. Once dry, the slides were
rinsed twice with xylene and cover slipped using DPX (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Slides were protected from light
during these steps. As a negative control, sections were processed as above without the primary antibody.
Double label immunohistochemistry for IP-10 and immune
cell surface markers was achieved by incubating the slides
with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to 594 or 488 nm fluorophores.
The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-rat
IP-10 (1:5,000; abcam; Cambridge, MA), mouse anti-rat CD3
for T cells (1:2,000; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and
mouse anti-rat CD11b for microglia/macrophages (1:3,000;
Serotec, Raleigh, NC). Alexa-Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit
(1:300; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) secondary
was used for all IP-10 staining. Alexa-Fluor® 594 goat antimouse (1:300; Life Technologies) secondary was used in
conjunction the immune cell surface markers for double staining with IP-10. Alexa-Fluor® 488 rabbit anti-mouse (1:300;
Life Technologies) secondary was used when only staining for
CD3 T cell.
IP-10 Immunohistochemistry in the Spleen
Spleens were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight.
The spleens were then placed in a solution of 20 %

682

glycerol and 2 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and embedded in a gelatin matrix using MultiBrain Technology© (NeuroScience Associates, Knoxville, TN). The
block of spleens was rapidly frozen in isopentane with
crushed dry ice (−70 °C). Using a microtome the block
was sliced into 25 μm sections. Six consecutive sections
were taken and collected in Antigen Preservation solution (50 % ethylene glycol, 49 % PBS pH 7.0, 1 %
polyvinyl pyrrolidone). The spleen sections were stained
free floating in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) solutions.
Endogenous peroxide activity was extinguished by treatment with 3 % hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. After
washing with TBS sections were incubated for 30 min
in permeabilization buffer (TBS with 0.3 % TritonX-100
and 10 % serum). Following permeabilization, slides
were incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibody in TBS with 2 % serum. The sections
were rinsed with TBS and incubated in secondary biotinylated antibody in TBS with 2 % serum for 1 h.
After being rinsed with TBS, sections were incubated
with an avidin/biotin/horseradish peroxidase complex
(Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h. Staining was visualized with 3,3′Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The sections were then mounted
on gelatinized slides, dried, dehydrated, cleared with
xylene, and cover slipped with Permount (Fischer Scientific, Pittsburg, PA). The primary antibody used was
rabbit anti-rat IP-10 (1:500; abcam) and the secondary
antibody was biotinylated goat anti-rabbit (Vector Laboratories). The IP-10 antibody’s specificity was determined by Western blotting using recombinant IP-10.

ventricle of the ipsilateral hemisphere. The images were
analyzed for percent of immunostaining per area with
ImageJ software.
Splenic IP-10 images were taken with a Nikon 90i microscope using a 20x objective and NIS Elements BR 4.00.07
software at a high resolution. The images were processed and
analyzed with Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose,
CA). The intensity of the staining was measured in the histogram for the entire image and the amount of staining per
image was analyzed. Six sections per spleen were analyzed
for each rat.
Confocal Imaging
Tissue sections that were double labeled were viewed on the
Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo
Grove, IL). Images were taken at a magnification of 63x. Each
fluorophore was scanned sequentially and then the two images
were merged.
Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as group mean ± SEM. Significance of
the data was determined by ANOVA with Fischer’s Least
Significant Difference post hoc test for all analysis. A value
of p<0.05 was considered significant. All sections were
blinded prior being analyzed by an investigator.

Results
IP-10 levels are elevated in the brain following MCAO

Immunohistochemistry Quantification
IP-10 stained brain tissue sections were digitally
photographed with Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope controlled
by Openlab software at a 10x magnification. Three images
from each of 4 Bregma points (1.7 to −1.3 mm) were taken for
a total of twelve images per brain. The area selected for
quantification was the striatum of the ipsilateral hemisphere
for all animals. The images were analyzed for percent of
immunostaining per area with ImageJ software. These twelve
values were then averaged for each brain. Percent immunostaining was used for the brain sections since the IP-10 staining was diffuse which didn’t lend itself to an “intensity”
measure as noted below for the more prevalent staining of
the spleen.
CD3 stained brain tissue sections were digitally
photographed with Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope controlled by Openlab software at a 10x magnification.
Images from Bregma point +0.7 mm were taken of the
peri-infract region of the striatum near the lateral

To determine if IP-10 protein is expressed in the brain
following MCAO, its protein expression in the striatum
of the ipsilateral hemisphere was characterized over
time. To quantify IP-10 levels, immunohistochemistry
for IP-10 was performed on brain sections from animals
euthanized at 48, 72, and 96 h following MCAO and
naïve (Fig. 1b-e) or sham operated rats. IP-10 protein
levels were significantly increased at 72 h and remained
elevated at 96 h (p<0.01) compared to sham operated
rats 96 h after surgery (Fig. 1a).

MCAO. Whereas, administration of rIFNγ to splenectomized
rats increases IP-10 levels to those not significantly different
from sham splenectomized rats post-MCAO (p ≤ 0.05;
Fig. 3a). However, splenic IP-10 expression was unaffected
by administration of rIFNγ (Fig. 3b).

IP-10 levels in the brain are reduced by splenectomy
and restored by rIFNγ administration

IP-10 is produced in monocytic cells in the brain following
MCAO

Splenectomy prior to MCAO is neuroprotective and reduces
the amount of IFNγ in the brain (Seifert et al. 2012b; Jin et al.
2013). IP-10 expression is induced by IFNγ; therefore, brains
of splenectomized rats that underwent MCAO were stained
for IP-10 protein expression. Splenectomy significantly reduces the amount of IP-10 in the infarct area of rats post-

IP-10 expression is induced by IFNγ in cells of monocytic origin. Double staining with IP-10 and CD11b, a marker for monocytes, was performed on the brains from
animals 96 h post-MCAO. Expression of IP-10 and
CD11b were co-localized in the infarcted area of the
ipsilateral hemisphere (Fig. 4).

IFNγ neutralizing antibody administration decreases infarct
following MCAO
To inhibit the pro-inflammatory IFNγ signaling pathway
that increases IP-10 transcription following MCAO, an
IFNγ neutralizing antibody was administered 24, 48,
and 72 h post-MCAO. Infarct volumes, as measured by
Fluoro-Jade staining, at 96 h post-MCAO were significantly decreased in the IFNγ neutralizing antibody group
compared to the vehicle and isotype control groups
(p < 0.007; Fig. 5d). Representative micrographs from
Fluoro-Jade stained brains show decreased staining in
the IFNγ neutralizing antibody treated group (Fig. 5c)
compared to the staining in the PBS (Fig. 5a) and IgG
isotype control (Fig. 5b) groups.

IFNγ neutralizing antibody decreased IP-10 in the brain
IP-10 protein expression was quantified in the striatum of the
ipsilateral hemisphere from rats treated with PBS (Fig. 6a),
control IgG (Fig. 6b), or IFNγ antibody (Fig. 6c). IP-10
immunoreactivity was significantly decreased in the IFNγ
antibody treatment group compared to the IgG isotype and
PBS control groups (p<0.009; Fig. 6d).

and splenectomy-rIFNγ (S-IFNγ, n=4)

received IgG (Fig. 7b) or IFNγ neutralizing antibody

Discussion
The amount of CD3 immunoreactivity decreases in the brains
of IFNγ neutralizing antibody treated animals
Brain sections from animals that underwent MCAO and then
administered an IFNγ neutralizing antibody, an IgG isotype
antibody, or PBS were stained using an anti CD3 antibody to
visualize the presence of T cells. At 96 h post-MCAO the
amount of CD3 immunostaining in the ipsilateral striatum was
significantly decreased in the IFNγ antibody treated group
compared to the IgG and PBS control groups (p<0.04;
Fig. 8d). Representative micrographs of the striatum show
reduced CD3 staining in the brains of IFNγ antibody

IP-10 levels are induced in the MCAO-injured hemisphere
where its expression significantly increases at 72 h and remains elevated at 96 h post-MCAO. These results are consistent with a delayed response and up regulation of protein
compared to an earlier increase in IP-10’s mRNA levels.
Studies looking at mRNA levels of IP-10 in the brain following MCAO found increased mRNA as early as 6 h postMCAO (Offner et al. 2006). As expected, IP-10 within the
infarct is expressed in cells of the monocytic lineage
(CD11b+), which are most likely microglia. IFNγ is known
to activate cells of monocytic origin to produce IP-10 (Boehm
et al. 1997). Splenectomy decreases IFNγ levels in the brain
(Seifert et al. 2012b), subsequently prevents the increase in IP10 in the brain following MCAO. However, we have previously shown that administration of rIFNγ after MCAO reversed the protective effects of splenectomy (Seifert et al.
2012b) and additionally this treatment increased the expression of IP-10 protein in the injured brain to levels not significantly different from those from sham splenectomized rats.
Additionally, sham splenectomized rats that received rIFNγ
after MCAO did not further elevate levels of IP-10 in the
spleen or the brain, showing that the endogenous IFNγ response elicited by the spleen to stroke is a maximal response.
The spleen reacts to bodily injuries by eliciting an inflammatory response that further exacerbates cellular damage.
Splenectomy is protective in a variety of ischemic injuries in
other organs including the liver, (Okuaki et al. 1996) kidney,
(Jiang et al. 2007) intestines, (Savas et al. 2003) and heart
(Leuschner et al. 2010). Additionally, removal of the spleen is
neuroprotective in several types of brain injuries including

of the spleen following MCAO also reduces infarct volume

means results in protection from ischemic tissue injuries.

chemokine IP-10 that begins at 24 h and remains elevated at
least out to 96 h post-MCAO. IFNγ despite a very short halflife elicits protracted effects. An IFNγ-induced feed forward
inflammatory cycle is initiated when the protracted expression
of IP-10 secreted from macrophage/microglia recruits inflammatory T cells to the infarct and they express and secrete more
IFNγ, leading to further activation and expression of IP-10 in
macrophages/microglia ultimately resulting in delayed neural
injury. Since IFNγ is not directly neurotoxic (Seifert et al.
2012b), its downstream activation of macrophages/microglia
appears to be the mechanism by which this inflammatory

cytokine can indirectly be responsible for delayed
neurodegeneration.
Splenectomy not only reduces infarct volume but neuroinflammation as demonstrated by decrease in levels of IFNγ, IP10, CD3 T cell immunoreactivity, and CD11b microglial
activation in the infarct (Seifert et al. 2012b; Jin et al. 2013).
Removal of the spleen blunts the IFNγ mediated immune
response to the brain following stroke, which includes IP-10
expression, and recruitment and activation of T cells. The
importance of IFNγ in the splenic response is clearly demonstrated in that the administration of IFNγ reverses the

688

neuroprotective effects provided by splenectomy. Using a
neutralizing antibody directed against IFNγ administered after
MCAO could provide further evidence that IFNγ is the neurodegenerative mediator originating from the spleen.
Systemic administration of an IFNγ neutralizing antibody
significantly decreases infarct volume when compared to vehicle controls. These results are consistent with previous observations where IFNγ was blocked (Yilmaz et al. 2006; Liesz
et al. 2009; Liesz et al. 2011). Studies using IFNγ−/− mice
(Yilmaz et al. 2006) or inhibiting IFNγ with a neutralizing
antibody injected directly into the brain 3 days following
MCAO (Liesz et al. 2009) both decreased infarct volume.
Additionally, using an antibody directed at CD49d (very late
antigen 4, VLA4) prevented immune cells from entering the
brain following MCAO, leading to decreased infarct volume.
This treatment precluded the cells producing IFNγ from entering the injured brain (Liesz et al. 2011). These studies did
not investigate the downstream effects of IFNγ inhibition on
the expression of chemokines like IP-10. Our study shows that
striatal IP-10 levels in the brain are significantly decreased
with IFNγ neutralization. The amount of CD3 immunoreactivity is significantly reduced in the striatum of these rats as
well. This is expected as IFNγ is known to induce IP-10
production (Boehm et al. 1997) and IP-10 is a strong
chemoattractant for pro-inflammatory IFNγ producing T cells
(Groom and Luster 2011). The infarct volumes for the IFNγ
neutralizing antibody were significantly reduced compared to
the IgG and vehicle controls. Moreover, a potentially more
effective approach would be to use these antibodies in conjunction with pharmaceuticals that block IFNγ or its downstream intracellular signal transduction.
The increase in IP-10 expression in the spleen, and later the
brain, is an important indicator of a pro-inflammatory prodegeneration splenic response to ischemic stroke. IFNγ signaling induces the expression of IP-10. Inhibiting IFNγ signaling results in a reduction in infarct volume, IP-10 protein
expression in the brain, and T cell recruitment to injured brain
area leading to decreased infarct size. Selectively targeting the
IFNγ signaling pathway is a potential treatment for stroke.
