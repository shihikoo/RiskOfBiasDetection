Background and Purpose—Secondary intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) is a potentially serious complication of ischemic
stroke, in particular under concomitant oral anticoagulation. Previous studies in murine stroke models defined a novel
vascular repair function of hematogenous monocytes/macrophages (MO/MP), which proved essential for the prevention
of oral anticoagulation–associated sICH. Here, we addressed the question whether hyperglycemia as a clinically relevant
prohemorrhagic risk factor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) activation affect MO/MP
differentiation and the risk of sICH after ischemic stroke.
Methods—Oral anticoagulation–associated sICH was induced by phenprocoumon feeding to mice undergoing transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion. Hyperglycemia was induced by streptozotocin treatment. The role of PPARγ-dependent
MO/MP differentiation was addressed in mice with myeloid cell–specific PPARγ-knockout (LysM-PPARγ(KO)).
Pharmacological PPARγ activation via pioglitazone was tested as a treatment option.
Results—Hyperglycemic mice and normoglycemic LysM-PPARγ(KO) mice exhibited abnormal proinflammatory skewing
of their hematogenous MO/MP response and abnormal vascular remodeling in the infarct border zone, leading to an
increased rate of oral anticoagulation–associated sICH. Pharmacological PPARγ activation in hyperglycemic mice
corrected the inflammatory response toward an anti-inflammatory profile, stabilized neovessels in the infarct border zone,
and reduced the rate of sICH. This preventive effect was dependent on the presence of macrophages, but independent
from effects on blood glucose levels.
Conclusions—Hyperglycemia and macrophage-specific PPARγ activation exert opposing effects on MO/MP polarization
in ischemic stroke lesions and, thereby, critically determine the risk of hemorrhagic infarct transformation.

ardioembolic stroke, mostly caused by atrial fibrillation,
accounts for at least a quarter of ischemic strokes, and
3% to 13% of patients with cardioembolic infarctions will
develop a second embolism within the first 2 weeks of symptom onset,1–5 which will double their mortality rate.6
Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is an effective medical treatment for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation.
The optimal time to start anticoagulation therapy after acute
cardioembolic ischemic stroke is currently unknown.7 The
uncertain risk of secondary intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH)
keeps many physicians from initiation of OAC, especially at
early stages after cardioembolic stroke where the infarction
may be particularly prone to hemorrhagic transformation. As
a prerequisite to clinical advance, pathomechanistic evidence

regarding the process of infarct demarcation and sICH is
urgently needed.
Inflammatory processes critically influence the evolution
of brain damage on ischemic stroke and may exert harmful
and beneficial effects.8,9 Cells of the innate immune system,
in particular hematogenous monocytes/macrophages (MO/
MP), dominate the postischemic inflammatory response.10 In
a variety of disease models, the balance of inflammatory and
noninflammatory MO/MP subpopulations11,12 determines the
development of tissue damage and functional outcome.13,14 It
was controversial to what extent the sequence of inflammatory and reparative MO/MP responses depends on sequential recruitment of respective cellular subgroups of MO/MP
or, alternatively, on the initial recruitment of inflammatory

monocytes with subsequent differentiation in the target tissue.13–15 We recently showed that inflammatory monocytes
invade ischemic brain parenchyma within 24 h of stroke onset
and subsequently differentiate within the ischemic brain tissue toward noninflammatory macrophages, which promote
early lesion repair, in particular vascular remodeling essential for the prevention of sICH.16,17 Thus, the hematogenous
recruitment of monocytes and their appropriate differentiation
into macrophages seems critical for the net effect of strokeinduced brain inflammation.
Frequent systemic comorbidities of stroke as diabetes18 or
hypercholesterolemia19 may promote proinflammatory skewing of MO/MP functioning in wound healing paradigms.20,21
Interestingly, hyperglycemia is also a risk factor for sICH
after stroke.22–24 We therefore addressed the question whether
hyperglycemia affects MO/MP-dependent repair mechanisms
preventing OAC-associated sICH. We furthermore aimed
to identify regulatory pathways of MO/MP differentiation,
which might serve as targets of preventive therapy.

Methods
Experimental procedures are detailed in Methods section in the
online-only Data Supplement and illustrated in Figure 1A. All animal experiments were approved by local authorities and performed
in accordance with international guidelines on handling laboratory animals. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 55 minutes
of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Mice were
anticoagulated by oral administration of phenprocoumon.17 To provoke hyperglycemia, streptozotocin (10 mmol/L in citrate buffer, pH
4.6; Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was injected intraperitoneally 6 weeks before tMCAO induction for 5 consecutive days.
Infarct volumes and hemorrhages were visualized by staining with
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride.17 LysM-PPARγ(KO) or LysMPPARγ(WT) mice were used to study the effect of proinflammatory macrophage skewing. Pharmacological PPARγ activation was
achieved by oral administration of pioglitazone (20 mg/kg body
weight; Takeda Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) starting directly after
tMCAO (d0). Clodronate-filled liposomes were used for depletion of
hematogenous macrophages.16 Cellular and molecular processes were
studied by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (see Table for primer sequences).
All analyses were performed by an investigator blinded for treatment
allocation. Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism
software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA), and results are presented as mean±SD.

Results
Risk of OAC-Associated sICH After tMCAO Is
Increased by Hyperglycemia
To investigate sICH after ischemic stroke, we used a previously described model16 of OAC-associated sICH (Figure 1A
and 1B). Feeding the vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon to
mice results in effective OAC with an international normalized ratio of 2.8±0.9 (n=10) 48 h later. Initiation of OAC at 24
h after tMCAO is associated with a rate of 50% hemorrhagic
transformation and lack of parenchymal hemorrhage at day 5
after stroke induction (Figure 1B).
To test the influence of hyperglycemia on the rate of
OAC-associated sICH, we used the streptozotocin model of
type I diabetes mellitus. In streptozotocin-treated mice, fasting blood glucose levels were increased to 320±56 mg/dL
(n=12), as opposed to 98±10 mg/dL in control mice (n=9;

via reduction of insulin resistance. Additionally, pioglitazone
has pleiotropic effects on a variety of cellular processes, notably the promotion of anti-inflammatory macrophage differentiation.25 Because insulin resistance does not contribute to
hyperglycemia in the streptozotocin model, we found similar
blood glucose levels in pioglitazone-treated versus untreated
mice (Figure 1C). Nevertheless, the rate of OAC-associated
sICH was significantly reduced in pioglitazone-treated hyperglycemic mice (Figure 1B). In particular, severe parenchymal hemorrhage was not observed on pioglitazone treatment.
Infarct volumes were not significantly different between
groups (control hyperglycemic 65±12 mm3 [n=9] versus pioglitazone-treated hyperglycemic mice 80±15 mm3 [n=7]).

Effects of Hyperglycemia and PPARγ Activation
on MO/MP Phenotype and Inflammatory Gene
Expression
Because the reduction of sICH by pioglitazone treatment was
independent from blood glucose levels, we hypothesized that
hematogenous macrophage-targeted effects of pioglitazone
might underlie its protective effect in our model. Flow cytometric analysis of intracerebral leukocytes at day 3 after stroke
was used to distinguish CD45hiCD11b+ hematogenous MO/
MP from CD45intCD11b+ central nervous system-resident
microglia (Figure 2A), as validated previously in bone marrow chimeric animals.16 Hematogenous inflammatory MO/
MP were identified by high Ly6c and low F4/80 expression,
whereas more differentiated MO/MP reciprocally upregulated
F4/80 and downregulated Ly6c (Figure 2A). Overall, population sizes of microglia, granulocytes, hematogenous MO/MP,
and their subpopulations, that is, undifferentiated Ly6chiF4/80lo
and differentiated Ly6cloF4/80hi MO/MP, were similar in control, hyperglycemic, and hyperglycemic pioglitazone–treated
mice (exemplified for CD45hiCD11b+ hematogenous MO/MP
in Figure 2A). This was confirmed by a similar level of Mac3+
phagocyte staining in immunohistochemical analysis (Figure
2B). However, expression of CD80 and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-α were increased in F4/80hi, but not in F4/80lo, MO/
MP of hyperglycemic mice, indicating that hyperglycemia
induced an abnormal proinflammatory phenotype specifically of differentiated hematogenous MO/MP (Figure 2C).
Pioglitazone treatment of hyperglycemic mice reduced CD80
and TNF-α expression by F4/80hi MO/MP toward the level of
normoglycemic controls (Figure 2C). In all other cell populations, CD80 and TNF-α were not changed by pioglitazone.
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of lesional
mRNA confirmed hyperinduction of inflammatory cytokines,

such as TNF-α and interleukin-1β, and a reciprocal decrease
of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as transforming growth
factor-β and interleukin-10, in hyperglycemic mice which
was corrected toward control levels by pioglitazone treatment
(Figure 2D). Taken together, hyperglycemia caused abnormal
proinflammatory skewing of differentiated hematogenous
MO/MP in the infarctions, which was corrected by pharmacological PPARγ activation.
Previous studies showed that myeloid cell–specific PPARγ
knockout in LysM-PPARγ(KO) mice induces proinflammatory skewing of MO/MP.26 To substantiate that proinflammatory skewing of MO/MP is sufficient to increase the rate of
OAC-associated sICH, we studied the rate of OAC-associated
sICH and the differentation of hematogenous MO/MP in
normoglycemic LysM-PPARγ(KO) mice. Compared with
wild-type controls, LysM-PPARγ(KO) mice exhibited higher
TNF-α expression in differentiated MO/MP and an increased
rate of hemorrhagic transformation after tMCAO (Figure 3A).

Prevention of OAC-Associated sICH Is
Macrophage-Dependent
To corroborate involvement of MO/MP in pioglitazone-driven
repair, we tested the effect of pioglitazone treatment on the
rate of sICH in MO/MP-depleted mice. Clodronate-filled
liposomes deplete bone marrow–derived MO/MP but leave
resident central nervous system macrophages/microglia unaffected.27 Confirming previous findings,16 early clodronate liposome administration at day 1 and 2 after tMCAO caused sICH
(Figure 3B). Pioglitazone treatment did not reduce the rate of
sICH in MO/MP-depleted mice. Thus, the protective effect of
pioglitazone depended on the presence of hematogenous MO/
MP and was not due to a direct effect on brain-resident cells.

Increased Rate of sICH in LysM-PPARγ(KO) and
Hyperglycemic Mice Is Associated With Defective
Vascular Remodeling
Our previous studies implicated hematogenous MO/MP in
the prevention of sICH by promoting collagen-4 deposition
around infarct neovessels in a transforming growth factorβ–dependent manner.16 To elucidate the mechanism underlying increased sICH in LysM-PPARγ(KO) and hyperglycemic
mice, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of
neovessel morphology and collagen expression in infarcted
brain parenchyma. Collagen-4 deposition in the infarct border
zone was reduced after tMCAO in LysM-PPARγ(KO) mice
(Figure 4A). Moreover, neovessels in LysM-PPARγ(KO)
mice were thin-walled and dilated (Figure 4B). An identical

mice (Figure 4C) and could be corrected by pioglitazone treatment (Figure 4C and 4D).

Discussion
Our results extend the knowledge concerning hemorrhagic
infarct transformation after ischemic stroke in 3 ways: we

could identify (1) hyperglycemia as a condition that provokes
proinflammatory, antireparative MO/MP polarization, (2)
proinflammatory skewed MO/MP as a prohemorrhagic factor in subacute stages after ischemic stroke, and (3) PPARγ
in monocyte-derived macrophages as endogenous regulator
of MO/MP polarization and a potential therapeutic target to
prevent sICH.

The uncertain risk of infarct bleeding, the optimal time
to start OAC after acute embolic stroke is currently uncertain.7 Our previous data17 suggested that initiation of OAC is
relatively safe beyond day 3 after stroke when macrophagedependent vascular remodeling has already resulted in sufficiently stable vessel walls in the infarct border zone. Our
present study extends these findings by modeling the influence of hyperglycemia as a frequent comorbidity in stroke
patients. Clinical studies have shown a worse prognosis of
ICH and an increased rate of hemorrhagic transformation on
systemic thrombolysis in hyperglycemic and diabetic stroke
patients.22,28 Regarding OAC-associated hemorrhage, clinical
trials showed an increased rate of bleeding complications in
diabetes mellitus, but did not specifically address its relevance
for ICH.29 Our findings in the murine model strongly suggest
diabetes mellitus as a risk factor for OAC-associated sICH, at
least under the conditions of marked hyperglycemia and subacute brain infarction modeled in our experiments.
Regarding pathomechanisms of sICH, Jickling et al30
suggested that early sICH is dependent on reperfusion and
blood–brain barrier disruption by reactive oxygen species
and metalloproteinases, whereas delayed sICH beyond 24 h
after ischemia is determined by postischemic inflammation
and vascular remodeling. Our previous studies using MO/MP
depletion in normoglycemic mice already strongly implicated
monocyte-derived macrophages in the prevention of delayed
hemorrhagic transformation by promoting vascular collagen-4
deposition in a transforming growth factor-β–dependent manner.16 Hemorrhagic transformation in the depletion paradigms
was associated with the formation of thin-walled and dilated
neovessels prone to rupture. In our present study, we found a
similar abnormal phenotype of neovessels in hyperglycemic
mice, indicating that abnormal proinflammatory skewing of
macrophage differentiation is functionally equivalent to a
complete lack of macrophages. Of note, MO/MP recruitment
per se was not altered in hyperglycemic mice. Thus, in line
with accumulating evidence in other models,15 appropriate differentiation of recruited MO/MP seems to be critical for the
outcome of stroke-associated inflammation.

Similar to hyperglycemic mice, we also found abnormal proinflammatory MO/MP skewing, disturbed neovessel formation, and an increased rate of sICH (encompassing
parenchymal hemorrhage and hemorrhagic transformation)
in mice with myeloid cell–specific PPARγ knockout. Why
PPARγ knockout only increased hemorrhagic transformation
but not parenchymal hemorrhage is currently an open question. However, we think that both conditions are only different manifestations of the same pathophysiological process.
Our findings therefore corroborate the impact of appropriate
MO/MP differentiation on controlling the risk of sICH and
mechanistically link the observed preventive effect of pharmacological PPARγ agonism with functional differentiation of
MO/MP in brain infarction. As a potential limitation, LysMPPARγ(KO) mice also exhibit altered neutrophil functions,26
which may contribute to the phenotype observed in our study.
Hyperglycemia as such favors a proinflammatory skewing of
MO/MP because they use glycolysis for rapid inflammatory
responses, whereas repair-associated MO/MP are dependent
on fatty acid oxidation for their long-term reparative tasks.31–33
Previous studies showed that PPARγ regulates the MO/MP
phenotype toward a more reparative phenotype25 and promotes
fatty acid oxidation in MO/MP. Taken together, by counteracting proinflammatory effects of hyperglycemia on MO/MP
activity at multiple levels, PPARγ constitutes a master switch
between systemic metabolic factors and local actions of MO/
MP in tissue injury and disease.
Previous studies described various beneficial effects of
PPARγ activation, including direct neuroprotection, as well
as broad anti-inflammatory effects, which may synergistically improve stroke outcome.34–37 We were not able to detect
differences in infarct size between PPARγ agonist–treated
animals and controls. Primary end point of our study was
the bleeding rate, and selection criteria might understate the
previously detected differences in infarct sizes. Pleiotropic
effects of PPARγ agonism to date hampered the identification
of relevant cells that convey its beneficial effects. Previous
targeted knockout studies only addressed the role of neuronally expressed PPARγ.37 Our macrophage-specific knockout
and depletion paradigms for the first time identify the impact
of macrophage differentiation on vascular repair and bleeding rate. Zhao et al described anti-inflammatory and antioxidative actions of PPARγ in subacute stages of primary ICH,
promoting neuroprotection and hematoma resolution and,
thereby, limiting brain damage.38,39 This concept is extended
by our present data, implicating PPARγ not only in the limitation of secondary damage but also in the initial prevention of
delayed sICH.
In a recent study of primary ICH, hyperglycemia promoted expansion of the intracerebral hematoma by plasma
kallikrein–mediated, osmosensitive inhibition of hemostasis.40,41 However, in our study, the effect of PPARγ agonism
was independent from blood glucose lowering but associated
with the protracted process of macrophage differentiation.
Accumulating evidence indicates that reshaping deranged
macrophage polarization rather than blocking MO/MP
recruitment per se is the most promising approach to MO/MP
as therapeutic targets.15,42,43

Taken together, the balance of pro- versus anti-inflammatory differentiation of hematogenous MO/MP determines the
risk of secondary hemorrhage after ischemic stroke. Targeting
PPARγ might be an effective means to promote protective and
repair-enhancing properties of hematogenous MO/MP in subacute brain infarction. As such, myeloid cell–specific PPARγ
activation might help to reduce the rate of sICH in high-risk
patients with a need of early OAC.

Hyperglycemia and PPARγ antagonistically influence macrophage polarization and
infarct healing after ischemic stroke

Michael Gliem, MD, Luisa Klotz, MD, Nico van Rooijen, PhD, Hans-Peter Hartung, MD,
Sebastian Jander, MD

Supplementary Methods

Animals
We used male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice (from Centre d’Elevage R. Janvier [CERJ], Le
Genest-St-Isle, France) weighing 28-32 g and aged 12-18 weeks and LysM-PPARγ(KO) or
LysM-PPARγ(WT) mice. 79 mice were used to exclude influences of hyperglycemia on INR
guided phenprocoumon treatment. 90 (+12 Bederson score <1 or no reperfusion, +12 blood
glucose < 250 mg/dl, +7 INR > 5) mice were used to study infarct development, bleeding rate
and hematogenous MO/MP in control, hyperglycemic and hyperglycemic pioglitazone treated
mice. In 41 (+2 Bederson score <1, +6 INR > 5) mice the effect of pioglitazone treatment in
normoglycemic mice was assessed. 24 (+2 Bederson score <1) mice were treated with
clodronate liposomes. 36 (+5 Bederson score <1 or no reperfusion, +2 INR > 5) LysMPPARγ(KO) and LysM-PPARγ(WT) were analyzed.

Stroke model
All animal experiments were approved by local authorities and performed in accordance with
international guidelines on handling laboratory animals. For tMCAO induction we used a 6–0
standardized suture coated with silicon rubber (6021PK10; Doccol Corporation, Redlands,

2
CA, USA) which was left in situ for 55 min.1 Only animals with successful reperfusion
(evidenced by blood reflux after suture withdrawal) and with a Bederson score >12 at day 1
after tMCAO were used for further experiments. Exclusions based on these criteria were
n=19. Infarct volumes and hemorrhages were visualized at the indicated time points by
staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride according to a previously described
protocol.3

Streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia
Streptozotocin (10 mmol/L in citrate buffer pH 4.6, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) was
injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight/day for 5 consecutive days. Each
injection was performed after 4 hours fasting. After 6 weeks, blood glucose was tested after 4
hours fasting with a bedside test. Animals with a fasting glucose < 250 mg/dl were excluded
from further experiments (n=12).

Pioglitazone treatment
Pioglitazone (Takeda Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) was dissolved in PBS and administered
once daily via gastric tubing (20mg/kg body weight) starting directly after tMCAO (d0) until
sacrifice.

Oral anticoagulation
Phenprocoumon tablets (HEXAL AG, Holzkirchen, Germany) were dissolved in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 0.24 mg/ml. The solution was administered once
daily via gastric tubing resulting in a dose of 0.8 mg/kg body weight/day. INR was monitored
at day 2 and day 4 after initiation of OAC using a point of care device (CoaguChek®, Roche,
Basel, Switzerland). Animals with an INR > 5 at any time point after treatment initiation were
excluded from analysis (n=15). 11 were excluded due to death before effective oral

3
anticoagulation was reached. Mortality rate in orally anticoagulated mice was 10% in control
mice, 23% in hyperglycemic and 11% in hyperglycemic pioglitazone treated mice. In mice
with effective oral anticoagulation after 48 hours mortality rate was 12% in control and 11%
in pioglitazone treated mice. In orally anticoagulated LysM-PPARγ(KO) mice mortality was
18% and 15% in LysM-PPARγ(WT) mice.

Flow cytometry
Intracerebral leukocytes were isolated from ischemic lesions (mean tissue weight 40 mg per
animal) or homotopic nonischemic tissue as detailed elsewhere4,5 and stained according to an
established protocol.6 In addition, we used FITC-labeled rat anti-mouse TNF-α (clone MP6XT22, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), FITC-labeled hamster anti-mouse CD80 (clone 1610A1, BD Biosciences) and APC-labeled rat anti-mouse F4/80 (clone C1:A3, Serotec Ltd.,
Oxford, UK) antibodies.

Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin sections were stained with polyclonal anti-collagen-4 (Meridian Life Science, Saco,
ME) followed by the Vectastain Elite kit reagents (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA),
and analyzed by ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

Macrophage depletion
For depletion of hematogenous macrophages we used clodronate-filled liposomes as detailed
elsewhere.6

Quantitative real-time PCR
Analysis of total RNA was performed by quantitative real-time PCR as described previously.7
Gene-specific primer pairs as indicated in Table 1 were designed by using PrimerExpress 2.0

4
software (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Relative gene expression levels were
determined according to the ∆∆Ct method.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad PrismTM software (GraphPad Software
Inc., La Jolla, CA).
