Icariin (ICA), an active ﬂavonoid extracted from Chinese medicinal herb Epimedii, has been reported to exhibit
many pharmacological effects including alleviating brain injury. However, little is known about the protection
of ICA on ischemic stroke. Hence, this study was designed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of ICA and explore its underlying mechanisms on ischemic stroke induced by cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury in
rats. The animals were pretreated with ICA at doses of 10, 30 mg/kg twice per day for 3 consecutive days followed
by cerebral I/R injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h and reperfusion for 24 h. Neurological function and infarct volume were observed at 24 h after reperfusion, the protein expression levels of
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), PPARα and PPARγ, inhibitory κB-α (IκB-α) degradation and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) p65 phosphorylation were detected by Western blot, respectively. It was
found that pretreatment with ICA could decrease neurological deﬁcit score, diminish the infarct volume, and reduce the protein levels of IL-1β and TGF-β1. Moreover, ICA suppressed IκB-α degradation and NF-κB activation
induced by I/R. Furthermore, the present study also showed that ICA up-regulated PPARα and PPARγ protein
levels. These ﬁndings suggest that ICA has neuroprotective effect on ischemic stroke in rats through inhibition
of inﬂammatory responses mediated by NF-κB and PPARα and PPARγ.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is the third leading cause of long-term disability and
one of the most common reasons for death worldwide [1]. The poor
prognosis and high mortality of patients with ischemic stroke is largely
due to the lack of effective therapies. Until now, recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDA-approved thrombolytic
agent in the treatment of ischemic stroke, but the application is limited
for narrow time window and serious side effects [2–4]. In the past decades, various classes of neuroprotective agents have reached phase III
efﬁcacy trials, but unfortunately, none has proven effective, despite successful preceding animal studies [5,6]. Thus, it is an imperative need for
novel neuroprotective agents that can be applied to the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members
of nuclear hormone receptor family, acting as ligand-activated transcription factors. There are three different PPAR isotypes, PPARα,
PPARβ (also known as PPARδ) and PPARγ, which have been identiﬁed
in various species. PPARs play essential roles in the regulation of lipid
and glucose metabolism, cell proliferation and differentiation, as well
as the inﬂammatory and oxidative responses [7,8]. Recent evidences

revealed that activation of PPARs is beneﬁcial in regulating neuronal
death in ischemic brain injury [9,10]. Agonists of the PPARα subtype,
such as gemﬁbrozil, fenoﬁbrate and WY14643, have been shown to signiﬁcantly decrease the cerebral infarct volume and improve cortical
blood ﬂow in animal models of cerebral ischemia [11–13]. Administration of the PPARγ agonists thiazolidinediones (troglitazone or pioglitazone) and other non-thiazolidinedione (L-796449) also dramatically
reduces infarction volume and improves neurological function in experimental stroke [14,15]. In spite of the relative data about the effects of
PPARβ/δ activation in ischemic brain injury are limited compared to
PPARα or PPARγ agonists, existing evidence still documented that activation of PPARβ/δ can attenuate ischemic damage and warrant further
investigation for the development of therapeutic strategy for stroke
[16,17]. These data strongly suggest that PPARs activators should be a
potential neuroprotective strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke
[9,10,18].
Icariin (ICA, structure shown in Fig. 1), a natural ﬂavonoid
compound extracted from Epimedium brevicornum Maxim (a traditional
Chinese herb), has been proven to possess a wide range of efﬁcacy including anti-tumor, anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial and anti-inﬂammatory,
etc. [19–21]. Our previous study has been engaged in the pharmacological research of ICA in the central nervous system and showed that ICA
can markedly attenuate cognitive deﬁcits in several models of
Alzheimer's disease [22–24] and alleviate neuronal injury induced by ischemia [25]. Furthermore, it is reported that ICA treatment after

reperfusion attenuates brain ischemic injury by increasing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α
(PGC-1α) [26]. PGC-1α was identiﬁed as a transcriptional coactivator
that regulates the genes involved in energy metabolism, and PPARα,
PPARβ/δ, PPARγ, thyroid hormone receptor, retinoid receptors, glucocorticoid receptor and estrogen receptor are PGC-1 target nuclear receptors [27]. Meanwhile, ICA is a novel PPARα agonist to activate lipid
metabolism gene expressions in liver [28]. Thus, it is speculated that
the effect of ICA improving neurological function during stroke is associated with the activation of PPARs.
Therefore, our current study was designed to further determine the
neuroprotective effect of ICA on cerebral I/R injury in middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) rats, including neurological deﬁcits and the infarct area, then to investigate whether PPARs is involved in the neuroprotective effect of ICA.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Reagent
Icariin (ICA, purity ≥ 98.6% by high-performance liquid chromatography) was purchased from Nanjing Zelang Medical Technology Corporation Ltd. (Nanjing, China), and dissolved in normal saline with 20 min
ultra-sonication. All reagents were of analytical grade and commercially
available.
2.2. Animals and grouping
Male adult Sprague–Dawley rats (4 months old, 250 to 280 g) were
obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Daping Hospital,
Research Institute of Surgery Third Military Medical University (SPFgrade, Certiﬁcate NO. SCXK 2007-0005) and were allowed to acclimatize for at least 7 days prior to experimentation. The animals were
housed (5 per cage) in SPF-grade animal facilities (certiﬁcate NO.
SYXK 2011-004) at Zunyi Medical University, under a 12 h light/dark
cycle, at 23 ± 1 °C, and allowed free access to water and food except
during procedures. Animal experiments were strictly carried out in accordance with the State Committee of Science and Technology of the
People's Republic of China Order No. 2 on November 14, 1988 (revised
2011), and the study protocol was approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee of the Zunyi Medical University. All surgery
was performed aseptically with every attempt made to minimize pain
and discomfort.
The rats were randomly divided into the following 4 groups (n =
10): sham, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO, vehicle), low(MCAO + ICA-L) and high-dose ICA-treatment (MCAO + ICA-H)
groups. Low- and high-dose ICA-treated groups were administered
with ICA at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg, respectively, by gavage twice
per day for 3 consecutive days, while sham and MCAO rats were administered volume-matched normal saline, instead.

After pretreatment with ICA for 3 days, MCAO was carried out as previously reported [29,30]. Brieﬂy, after anesthetization with intraperitoneal administration of chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg), the right
common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed through a midline neck incision,
and a 30 mm nylon monoﬁlament with a silicone-coated tip was
inserted into the ICA and gently advanced about 20 mm to block the
blood ﬂow of right middle cerebral artery (MCA). Following 120 min occlusion of the MCA, the monoﬁlament was pulled out followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Sham-operated animals underwent the same procedure
mentioned above except for monoﬁlament insertion. Body temperature
was maintained at 37 °C with a heating pad and lamp.
2.4. Neurological deﬁcit
Neurological examinations were performed at 24 h after reperfusion
by two observers who were blind to animal groups, using the modiﬁed
Bederson's method [31,32].
2.5. Infarct size measurement
5 animals extracted freely from each group were sacriﬁced following
anesthesia with chloral hydrate after neurological deﬁcit evaluation.
Brains were collected quickly and dissected into coronal slices of
2 mm. Then, brain slices were stained in a 0.1% triphenyl tetrazolium
chloride (TTC, Sigma, USA) solution for 15 min at 37 °C in dark, and
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Slices were imaged on
each side, and infarct areas of both hemispheres for each slice were
quantiﬁed. Infarct volume was determined as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere by a correction for edema [33].
2.6. Western blot
Brain samples (n = 5 for each group) were separated from the cortex including both the penumbra and ischemic core regions and homogenized in the cytosolic extraction buffer. Protein was extracted with
lysis buffer containing 1% protease inhibitor (NaF) and centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined
using the BCA protein assay kit. Total proteins from each sample was
diluted in 4 × loading buffer followed by incubation at 100 °C for
5 min, separated on 5–10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis gels, and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane.
Non-speciﬁc sites were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with
5% non-fat dry milk in PBS buffer with constant shaking and incubated
overnight at 4 °C with the following antibodies: anti-IL-1β (1:1000,
Abcam, USA), anti-TGF-β1 (1:1000, Abcam, USA), anti-PPARα (1:1000,
Abcam, USA), anti-PPARβ (1:1000, Abcam, USA), anti-PPARγ (1:1000,
Abcam, USA), anti-p-NF-κB p65 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology,
USA), anti-NF-κB p65 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) and
anti-IκB-α (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA). After incubation
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature with shaking,

3. Results
3.1. Effect of ICA on neurological deﬁcit
To investigate the effect of ICA on neurological deﬁcits in cerebral I/R
injury rats, behavior test was performed in a blinded manner by two observers. As shown in Table 1, sham rats got a score of 0, indicating that
no neurological deﬁcit was observed in sham-treated rats, whereas
rats that received cerebral I/R surgery showed severe behavioral disturbance, such as retracting left forepaw or falling while walking. The neurological score of MCAO rats with vehicle treatment was 2.50 ± 0.71.
While the MCAO rats pretreated with ICA 10 and 30 mg/kg twice a
day showed improved neurological function, with signiﬁcantly
(P b 0.05 and P b 0.01 vs model group) decreased scores.
3.2. Effect of ICA on brain infarct volume in MCAO rats
The possible neuroprotective effect of ICA was also assessed using
infarct volume of brain. No infarct area was observed in the shamoperated rats. In contrast, a large cerebral lesion volume was observed
in the MCAO group. However, the smaller infarct volume was achieved
in rats pretreated with ICA compared with those pretreated with vehicle
(Fig. 2, P b 0.05).

immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the ECL Western blot detection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., USA). The image was scanned
and band optical intensity was quantiﬁed using Quantity One 1-D analysis software v4.52 (BioRad, USA).

2.7. Statistical analysis
The data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software (SPSS, USA). Differences between groups
were compared by one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) followed

IL-1β and TGF-β1 expression levels were detected using Western
blot. The expression of IL-1β and TGF-β1 proteins in model group was
signiﬁcantly higher compared to sham group (Fig. 3, P b 0.01). However,
pre-treatment with ICA markedly down-regulated the levels of aforementioned proteins compared with those pretreated with vehicle in a
dose-dependent manner.
3.4. Effect of ICA on IκB-α degradation and NF-κB activation
To investigate the underlying mechanisms of ICA on reduction of IL1β and TGF-β1 expression, the levels of IκB-α and phosphorylation of
NF-κB were analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4, cerebral I/R
injury signiﬁcantly decreased the IκB-α level compared with the sham
group, whereas ICA pretreated restored IκB-α protein expression in a
dose-dependent manner, indicated that ICA could suppress the cerebral
I/R-induced IκB-α degradation. Meanwhile, cerebral I/R injury signiﬁcantly increased the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 protein and reduced
following ICA pretreatment (P b 0.01). These results indicated that ICA

could alleviate the cerebral I/R-induced IκB-α degradation and the following NF-κB activation.
3.5. Effect of ICA on protein expression of PPARs
In order to further explore whether PPARs are involved in the ICAinduced neuroprotection against I/R, the protein levels of PPARα,
PPARβ and PPARγ were detected. PPARα protein expression was significantly up-regulated in the brain tissue after reperfusion following pretreatment with ICA (Fig. 5A, P b 0.05). Simultaneously, PPARγ protein
expression was also increased at 24 h after reperfusion in rats
pretreated with ICA at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg compared with those
pretreated with vehicle alone after MCAO (Fig. 5B, P b 0.01).
4. Discussion
Cerebral I/R injury caused by MCAO is the most frequently used experimental model, which can successfully imitate the pathological evolution of stroke [34,35]. In this study, the rat model of MCAO was
applied to observe the effect of ICA on ischemic brain injury and focused
on the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that
pretreatment with ICA signiﬁcantly alleviated I/R-induced disability
and reduced the infarct volume in rats, which was associated with its attenuated effect on neuroinﬂammatory response and NF-κB activation.
Moreover, the present study provided the ﬁrst evidence that both
PPARα and PPARγ are involved in the neuroprotective effect of ICA.
ICA possesses a broad spectrum of pharmacological applications, including erectile function improvement, immunological function enhancement and neuroendocrine regulation, etc. [26,36,37]. Previous
study indicates that ICA played a role in neuroprotection with doses of
30 mg/kg to 120 mg/kg in rats [24,38] and may be useful in the

treatment of ischemic brain injury at doses of 100 mg/kg [25,26].
Hence in the present study, ICA was administered for 3 days before ischemia to observe the potential neuroprotective effect of ICA on ischemia stroke in much lower doses [39], and it was demonstrated that
ICA pretreatment at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg twice per day for consecutive 3 days markedly decreased neurological function deﬁcit and diminished infarct volume in rat model of MCAO. These ﬁndings
indicated that in addition to therapeutic effect, ICA also exerted neuroprotective effect against ischemia brain injury.
Inﬂammatory response contributes to the pathophysiology of cerebral injury and it has been reported to be of importance in pathogenesis
of stroke [40,41]. Elevated expression levels of inﬂammatory mediators
after ischemia accompanying with worsening of the infarct severity
[42]. Therefore the expression of inﬂammatory mediators including IL1β and TGF-β1 after cerebral I/R surgery was investigated. Consistent
with previous reports, our study found that the protein level of IL-1β
and TGF-β1 dramatically increased in ischemic brain. However, ICA pretreatment markedly reduced the expression of IL-1β and TGF-β1 in a
dose-dependent manner. Thus, anti-inﬂammation is a potential underlying mechanism that ICA protects the brain from stroke-induced
syndromes.
NF-κB, an ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates genes involved in inﬂammation and immune response, normally exists in the
cytoplasm where it binds to its inhibitory proteins known as IκB and remains inactive [43]. Upon stimulation, IκB is rapidly phosphorylated by
IκB kinases, inducing the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus and initiates the transcription of target genes, including IL-1β and TGF-β1. Our
data support strongly that, as a pivot regulator of inﬂammation, NF-κB is
activated and contributes to cerebral ischemic injury [44,45]. Furthermore, the degradation of IκB-α and the following phosphorylation of
the p65 subunit of NF-κB were suppressed by pretreatment with ICA.

In the present study we also proved that up-regulation of PPARα and
PPARγ was involved in the mechanism that ICA protects against cerebral I/R injury for the ﬁrst time. PPARs are considered to be endogenous
neuroprotective factors as there are increasing evidences demonstrating that pharmacological activation of PPARs contributed to neuroprotection in ischemic injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease
[46–48]. The beneﬁcial effects of PPARs are due to the inhibition of inﬂammatory responses via suppressing the activation of NF-κB pathway
under various pathological conditions, including ischemia [49,50]. In
this study, PPARα and PPARγ, but not PPARβ, were signiﬁcantly upregulated in the brain tissue after cerebral I/R injury following pretreatment with ICA. We therefore postulate that the protective effect of ICA
on brain ischemic injury is associated with up-regulation of both
PPARα and PPARγ.
Taken together, the present study demonstrates for the ﬁrst time
that ICA has preventative effects on MCAO induced acute ischemic
stroke. The protective mechanisms are likely due to attenuated neurological dysfunction and reduced infarct volume via up-regulating of
PPARα and PPARγ and physiologically blocking NF-κB activation, consequently suppressing inﬂammatory responses. These results indicate
that ICA might be a potential PPARα and PPARγ agonist to treat ischemic stroke for the ﬁrst time, and selective PPARs antagonists or PPAR
knock-out animals will be further required to clarify the exact molecular
mechanism.
