Abstract. Protectants and executioners have been demonstrated to be used by gap junctions in focal cerebral ischemia.
Certain researchers hypothesized that the opposite role of
gap junctions may be associated with the injury extent, which
has been demonstrated to be highly correlated with occlusion
duration. In order to examine this hypothesis directly, the
effects of octanol, a frequently used drug, were examined to
investigate the role of gap junctions, in rats following middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 30 min/2 h and 24 h
reperfusion, respectively. Octanol significantly reduced the
infarct volume following 2 h of occlusion concomitant with
lower neurological deficits, whereas it enlarged the infarct
volume following 30 min of occlusion. Consistently, octanol
attenuated the number of transferase dUTP nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) positive neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region
following 2 h of occlusion, while opposite effects were
observed for 30 min of occlusion. Further immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the expression of B-cell
leukemia-2 (Bcl-2, anti-apoptotic protein) was upregulated
and that Bcl-2-associated X (Bax, proapoptotic protein) was
downregulated following 2 h of occlusion in the octanol group
compared with the ischemic group. Conversely, octanol downregulated the expression of the Bcl-2 protein concomitant with
increased Bax protein following 30 min of occlusion. These

occlusion.
Introduction
Gap junctions connect the interior of cells and are important
in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Certain deleterious
metabolites involved in cerebral ischemia and apoptotic associated molecules, including Ca 2+, IP3, ATP and cAMP, may
be small enough to pass through gap junctions and modulate
cell death of the neighboring cells, enhancing the spreading
of injury (1,2). Alternatively, the network of gap junctions
could prevent the death of injured cells by the buffering of
toxic metabolites to healthy surrounding cells (3). Thus, gap
junctions could have damaging and protective effects (4).
There is increasing evidence that suppressing gap junctions
is able to reduce the spread of damage following ischemia (5).
For example, the gap junction blocker octanol restricted the
flow of undesirable neurotoxins and significantly decreased
the spread of cell death (6). Similarly, connexin 43 (the
predominant connexin in gap junctions) heterozygous mice
demonstrated reduced shrinkage and metabolite abnormality
in the ipsilateral hippocampus following middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) (7). Lin et al demonstrated in vitro
that the resistance of C6 cells to calcium overload and oxidative stress was compromised when they formed gap junctions
with more vulnerable cells (8). Despite the detrimental role of
gap junctions, it is noteworthy that gap junctions may mediate
survival or be protective for adjacent cells. In mixed astrocyte
neuron cultures, the inhibition of astrocyte coupling with gap
junction blockers increased neuronal vulnerability to oxidative
stress or glutamic acid toxicity (9,10). Consistently, connexin
43 overexpression substantially suppressed zinc (released
during ischemia) toxicity whereas its knockdown caused a
significant enhancement of the toxicity (11).
Certain investigators proposed that the opposite role of
gap junctions may be associated with the extent of neuronal
death (12), which was highly correlated with the duration
of ischemia (13,14). Therefore, the present study examined
whether the opposite role of gap junctions was associated with
occlusion time. In order to examine this issue, a gap junction

blocker octanol was used, which has been administered to
investigate the role of gap junctions in numerous studies (6,15).
The effects of octanol in MCAO was evaluated using
neurological deficits, infarct volume and transferase dUTP
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining. To further investigate
the mechanism of the opposite roles of octanol, the expression
of Bcl-2 and Bax was studied, which play opposite roles in
apoptosis (16). The present study provides evidence that may
be used to further elucidate the opposite role of gap junctions
in ischemia.
Materials and methods
A nim al m odel of cerebral ischemia. Ma le adult
Sprague‑Dawley rats weighing 250-280 g were maintained in a
temperature‑ and light-controlled environment with a 12 h
light/dark cycle. All experiments were performed in accordance with the NIH guidelines and approval by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Guangzhou University of
Chinese Medicine (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) and all
efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.
A focal cerebral ischemic rat model was induced by MCAO
as previously described (17). In brief, the rats were anesthetized with 350 mg/kg of chloral hydrate via intraperitoneal
injection. The right carotid bifurcation was exposed and the
external carotid artery was coagulated distal to the bifurcation. A 4-0 nylon monofilament suture with a rounded tip was
introduced into the internal carotid artery through the stump
of the external carotid artery and gently advanced for ~20 mm.
Following 30 min/2 h of occlusion, the filament was gently
withdrawn and the incision was closed (18). During the whole
process, the rat rectal temperature was maintained at 37˚C by
placing the animals on a heating bed. In the sham-operated
rats, the common carotid was exposed without ligation.
Drug treatment. Octanol purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO, USA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO;
0.005% v/v) and a final concentration of 5 mmol/kg was
administered intraperitoneally 30 min prior to ischemia (6).
The vehicle‑treated rats were administered equal volumes of
DMSO.
Measurement of neurological deficits. An independent
observer performed the assessment of the neurological deficit
score: 0, no neurological deficit; 1, failure to fully extend left
forepaw; 2, circling to the left; 3, falling to the left; 4, loss of
spontaneous walking with a depressed level of consciousness
and 5, dead (17).
Measurement of infarct volume. Following reperfusion for 24 h,
rats were overdosed with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg).
The brains were quickly removed and cut into coronal slices
of 2 mm in thickness. The sections were immersed in a 2%
solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Mym
Biological Technology, Andhra Pradesh, India) for 20 min at
37˚C and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The infarct
area was measured by each slice using a computerized image
analysis system (Image‑Pro‑Plus; Media Cybernetics, Silver
Spring, MD, USA). Infarct areas of all sections were added
to derive the total infarct area, which was multiplied by the

thickness. The infarct volume was expressed as a percentage
of the ipsilateral hemispheric volume (%).
Tissue preparation and TUNEL assay. Rats were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and perfused through the
ascending aorta with cold saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2-7.4,
4˚C). The brains were cytoprotected by 15 and 30% sucrose
sequentially. Coronal sections were cut on a freezing microtome at a thickness of 15 µm starting at +1.60 mm to -4.80 mm
from the bregma and then were mounted onto polylysine-coated
slides. Intervening sections were air dried, then stored at -80˚C
until future use. TUNEL staining was processed using an in
situ cell death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals,
Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Images were captured using an Olympus microscope
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and the number of TUNEL-positive
neurons within the CA1 subfield was counted.
Immunohistochemistry. Brain sections (15 µm thickness)
were mounted with 2% goat serum in 0.1 M of Tris buffered
saline (TBS)/0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature
and incubated overnight at 4˚C with the primary antibody
for Bcl-2/Bax (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa
Cruz, CA, USA). Following washing in TBS, sections were
incubated with biotinylated goat anti‑rabbit IgG and further
processed with the ABC method (Vector, San Diego, CA,
USA). The stained sections were captured with a CCD spot
camera. Non-specific staining was determined by omitting the
primary antibodies.
To quantify Bcl-2 and Bax immunoreactivity (IR), the
measurement was performed with a computerized image
analysis system (Image-Pro-Plus, Media Cybernetics)
according to the previously described method (19). Briefly, a
density threshold was set above the background level firstly to
identify a positively stained structure and the area occupied
by these structures was measured as positive area. An average
percentage of Bcl-2-IR or Bax-IR area to the total outlined
area was obtained. Five to six animals were included in each
group for the quantification of immunohistochemistry.
Quantification and statistical analysis. Observers blinded to
the experimental conditions, evaluated the outcome measures.
All data are presented as the mean ± SEM. The Student's t-test
was used to compare the difference between the vehicle group
and the octanol group. All analysis was performed using the
Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 13.0 for
Windows). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically
significant difference.
Results
Neurological deficits. The effect of octanol was evaluated by
the Zea Longa test. As shown in Fig. 1, octanol significantly
lowered the neurological deficits compared with the vehicle
group following 2 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion
(P=0.028). As for the 30 min ischemia group, although the
mean of the neurological deficit scores was higher in the
octanol group, the difference between the two groups was not
statistically significant (P=0.181).

Infarct volume evaluation. Representative images of TTC
staining were shown in Fig. 2. The infarct volume following
2 h of occlusion was reduced by octanol pretreatment
compared with the vehicle group (P=0.001). Conversely,
a larger stroke volume was observed in the octanol group
following 30 min of occlusion compared with that in the
vehicle group (P=0.025).
T UNE L a ssa y. A moderate nu mber of ma rkedly
TUNEL‑labeled CA1 pyramidal neurons were identified in
the CA1 region in the vehicle group following ischemia for
2 h and reperfusion for 24 h. However, the number of TUNELpositive neurons in the CA1 region of rats pretreated with
octanol was markedly decreased (t=7.812, P<0.001; Fig. 3).
Notably, in the 30 min ischemia group, octanol significantly
increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells compared
with the vehicle group (t=4.595, P=0.002; Fig. 3).
Expression of Bcl-2 and Bax. Apoptosis contributes to
delayed neuronal death causing expansion of the stroke lesion,
therefore we investigated the expression of anti‑apoptotic
Bcl-2 and pro‑apoptotic Bax expression. In the 2 h ischemia
group, compared with the vehicle group, octanol significantly increased the expression of Bcl-2 (t=6.151, P<0.001),
however decreased the expression of Bax (t=2.768, P=0.016;
Figs. 4 and 5). However, in the 30 min ischemia group, the
rats treated with octanol demonstrated that, accompanied
by a decrease in Bcl-2 expression (t=2.907, P=0.012), Bax
expression was markedly increased (t=4.149, P=0.001;
Figs. 4 and 5).
Discussion
The present study demonstrated and compared for the first
time, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of the gap
junction blocker octanol in MCAO for 2 h and 30 min,
respectively. Compared with the vehicle-treated rats, octanol
attenuated the ischemia injury induced by 2 h of occlusion
demonstrated by the neurological deficit, infarct volume and

2487

TUNEL staining, whereas it aggravated the ischemia injury
induced by 30 min of occlusion, indicating that octanol was
protective following 2 h of occlusion but harmful following
30 min of occlusion. Octanol, an eight-carbon aliphatic
alcohol, is a relatively specific inhibitor of gap junction
permeability and is frequently used to study the role of
gap junctions. Although certain studies have demonstrated
that octanol can interfere with synaptic transmission (20),
it is hard to interpret these two opposite effects with gap
junction-independent mechanisms. The opposite role of
octanol appears to be closely associated with the function
of gap junctions (21). For example, gap junctions could be
neuroprotective since adjacent healthy cells may act as an
effective spatial buffer against the extracellular accumulation
of neurotoxic substances (22,23). By contrast, they could also
be harmful when neighboring cells are unable to aid in the
clearance of the neurotoxic substances, which could depolarize a large number of neurons/glia promoting the release
of glutamate and therefore causing aggravated injury (24).
Gap junctions have been revealed to be protective in the
model of hypoxic preconditioning (subthreshold insults) (25),
MCAO above and below the rhinal fissure (26-29) and MCAO
for 30 min (30). By contrast, previous investigations also
demonstrated that gap junctions were harmful in the model
of four vessels occlusion (31), clamping the common carotid
arteries and lowering the mean arterial blood pressure to
40 mmHg (6), MCAO for 16 h (32) and oxygen-glucose
deprivation (OGD) for 6 to 10 days (33). As the intensity
and/or the duration of the ischemic episode increases, the
predominant function of gap junctions may be different.
For example, when the buffering effect is stronger than the
harmful factors' propagation in the condition that injury is
mild, gap junctions may be neuroprotective; otherwise gap
junctions may be harmful. In the present study, the infarct
volume following 30 min of occlusion was only 6.4%, thus
gap junctions were efficient in buffering harmful factors.
By contrast, 2 h of occlusion induced a much larger infarct
volume, therefore gap junctions could not buffer harmful
factors efficiently and more neurotoxic substances propagated to neighbouring cells aggravating the injury instead.
Notably, while octanol significantly increased the infarct
volume and cell death following 30 min of occlusion, no
statistical differences in neurological deficits were identified
between the octanol group and the vehicle group. Similarly,
Longa et al demonstrated that the infarct area following 2 h
of temporary MCAO were 15.7% smaller than that following
permanent MCAO, however the neurological deficit was
not significantly reduced (17). In light of these findings, the
neurological score was not closely associated with the infarct
volume as occasionally the changes in infarct volume may
not be enough to create differences in the neurological test.
To explore the possible mechanisms, we detected Bcl-2
and Bax immunoreactivity, respectively, which are two
opposite apoptotic factors. Bcl-2 can help neuronal survival
and protect brain tissue from ischemic injury (34,35). It acted
upstream to prevent the activation of caspases, inhibited free
radical formation and regulated calcium sequestration (36).
However, Bax inhibition reduced apoptotic neuronal injury
in the hippocampal CA1 region and behavioral deficits
following global ischemia (37,38). In the present study, we

revealed that octanol induced Bcl-2 expression and attenuated
Bax expression in MCAO for 2 h. By contrast, it inhibited
Bcl-2 expression and increased Bax staining in MCAO for
30 min. These results demonstrated that the protective role of
octanol in ischemia for 2 h may be associated with its ability
to prevent apoptosis via facilitation of the anti-apoptotic
factor Bcl-2 or inhibition of the apoptotic biochemical factor
Bax. Conversly, the decreased Bcl-2 and increased Bax
contributed to apoptosis, thus resulting in a harmful role
of octanol in ischemia for 30 min. We are not completely
certain that the opposite roles of octanol on Bcl-2 and Bax
is directly mediated by gap junction activity. However, the
consistency between ischemia injury and the corresponding
Bcl-2/Bax expression in ischemia for different durations, to
a certain extent, verifies that the present results are mainly
attributed to the effect of octanol on gap junctions.
In summary, the present study investigated and compared
the effects of octanol in MCAO for the first time, to the best
of our knowledge. Our results demonstrated that the gap
junction blocker octanol played opposite roles in MCAO
for different durations, which was demonstrated by the
neurological outcome, infarct size and TUNEL staining. In
addition, the function of octanol was at least in part mediated through the counter-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bax. These
data provide a novel perspective for the role of gap junctions
in cerebral ischemia and may be beneficial for the potential
clinical treatment of various ischemic conditions. However,
more studies are required to examine this, including using
other blockers of gap junctions or connexin 43 deficient mice.
