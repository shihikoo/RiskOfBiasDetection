Abstract
Clinical and experimental studies have been focused on the
pathophysiological mechanisms induced by brain ischemiareperfusion injury. Recovery events, such as neurogenesis,
angiogenesis and the growth of new blood vessels from the
preexisting vascular tree, have been intensively studied in
the last decades to clarify the vascular remodeling crucial for
stroke outcome. This review aims to discuss the cerebral microcirculation remodeling induced by ischemia-reperfusion
and the mechanisms involved in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. The first in vivo observations were focused on anastomotic shunting of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in experimental and clinical models. Thereafter, vascular remodeling induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion was reported in
mice and rats. Successively, other studies have assessed that
within 30 days of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in
rats, there is an increase in CBF and recovery from stroke. Recently, rats submitted to transient MCA occlusion showed
pial microcirculation remodeling with the formation of new
arterioles sprouting from penumbra vessels and overlapping the ischemic core. This review focuses on the production and/or activation of vasculotrophic factors able to trigger and facilitate microvascular remodeling. Vascular endothelial growth factor and endothelium-released nitric oxide
appear to be the main factors involved in the formation of
new vessels during microvascular remodeling. These studies

Introduction

The brain, in a similar manner to the heart, requires
constant perfusion to maintain the supply of nutrients
and oxygen to the neurons [1–5]. Specifically, the brain is
the organ in the human body with the highest energy consumption due to its essential neuronal activity; for these
characteristics, oxygen deprivation in the cerebral tissues
can only be tolerated for seconds before significant damage is done. Under normal conditions, the blood supply
to the brain is, on average, 50 ml/min/100 g of tissue, of
which 80 ml/min/100 g are designed to reach the gray
matter and 20 ml/min/100 g to reach the white matter.
During ischemia, the corresponding cerebral blood flow
(CBF) threshold is about 20 ml/min/100 g in both humans and in a number of animal species. With CBF levels
below 8–12 ml/min/100 g, oxygen supplies no longer suffice to fuel vital cell functions, such as the maintenance of
ion homeostasis across cell membranes, and the brain tissue therefore suffers permanent damage within minutes.
At a CBF above this level, ischemic tissue may survive for
several hours and even regain function if the CBF can be
normalized [6].
Therefore, it is crucial to clarify the cerebral vascular
responses to ischemia that are effective in overcoming a

The Blood Supply to the Brain

The cerebral vasculature has unique anatomical and
physiological features that help protect the brain from
circulatory compromise. Throughout evolution, the
brain has undergone many structural changes as the complexity of the nervous system increased [13]. Encephalon
and geometric arrangements of arterial vessels were modified, according to a direct correlation between the evolution of the central nervous system and changes in the
macro- and microarchitecture of the encephalic vessels
[14–17]. The main characteristics of brain circulation are
Remodeling of Cerebral Microcirculation

the arteriolar anastomotic networks, useful for protecting
the brain when a part of its vascular supply is blocked. The
Willis’ Circle provides an overlapping of blood supply, so
that if one part of the Circle or one of the arteries supplying the Circle is blocked or narrowed (stenosis), the flow
of blood from the other blood vessels can often preserve
the cerebral perfusion well enough to avoid the symptoms
of ischemia. The small penetrating vessels arising from
the Willis’ Circle and the proximal major arteries tend to
lack anastomoses [18, 19].
Considering this complex network of vessels with its
large number of anastomoses, it has been suggested that
the short-term recovery from stroke is facilitated by the
blood circulation in the anastomotic vessels. Several
studies support this notion, but the formation of new
vessels via the activation of angiogenetic mechanisms has
been underestimated for a long time. To clarify the mechanisms of recovery from stroke, many data have been
derived and demonstrated by means of experimental
models.
In recent years, animal models have provided a better
understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of
cerebral ischemia. Mice and rats are the most commonly
used species, but there is growing use of large species, like
rabbits and even nonhuman primates, in order to study
stroke mechanisms better [20]. Several methods of ischemia induction have been described, including craniotomy, arterial embolism and the chronic or transient occlusion of two or four cervical vessels [21, 22]. Variations in
how long ischemia lasts contribute to the diversity of the
experimental models. Up to now, the main experimental
models for inducing cerebral ischemia are two-vessel (bilateral common carotid artery occlusion) and four-vessel
(2 vertebral arteries and 2 common carotid arteries) occlusion, while middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion is
used to cause focal cerebral ischemia, especially in rat and
mouse models [23]. These experimental models have
been extensively reviewed by Traystman [24] and Garcia
[25].
Animal models of focal ischemia have mainly been
used to study energy metabolism in ischemia and to evaluate neurotransmitter metabolism, histopathological
changes and the protective effect of different substances.
Moreover, two-vessel occlusion is widely for in vivo assessment of microvascular changes during ischemia and
reperfusion, because this method involves the pial microvasculature, causing arteriolar diameter changes, an increase in microvascular permeability and in the number
of adherent leukocytes to the venular walls as well as a
reduction in capillary perfusion and red blood cell velocJ Vasc Res 2015;52:22–31

reduction in the supply of blood as well as the mechanisms able to facilitate cerebral tissue perfusion recovery
after ischemic attack. The main purpose of a long series
of experimental and clinical studies has been to determine the successive events in cerebral ischemia and the
mechanisms that are involved in stroke recovery [6–8].
The first or short-term response to cerebral ischemia
may be represented by redistribution of the blood flow
from normal to damaged areas. The long-term response
may be neurogenesis, synaptic plasticity and angiogenesis, i.e. the growth of new blood vessels from the preexisting vascular tree, or vasculogenesis, i.e. the ‘de novo’ formation of new vessels. These two mechanisms are defined
as vascular remodeling [9–12].
The purpose of this review was to discuss cerebral microcirculation remodeling induced by ischemia-reperfusion, with particular attention being paid to angiogenesis
and vasculogenesis. These mechanisms are responsible
for the development of blood vessels and represent the
key potential factors in the process of recovery from
stroke.
Cerebrovascular remodeling is suggested to be an active process of structural rearrangements that involves
short-term changes, like the activation of anastomotic
collateral vessels, and long-term changes in at least four
cellular mechanisms, i.e. cell growth, cell death, cell migration and production or degradation of the extracellular matrix. However, all of these processes are dependent
on a dynamic interaction between locally generated
growth factors, vasoactive substances and hemodynamic
stimuli [12]. Due to the complexity of this phenomenon
and to the particular tissues involved, many details have
been determined. The time-dependent progress in angiogenesis or vasculogenesis, the type of new vessels formed
and their spatial reorganization are the main focus of this
report.

Vascular Changes after Focal Cerebral Ischemia

Ischemic stroke activates complex processes that facilitate the restoration of an adequate blood flow in the
infarct zone. A long series of experimental and clinical
data suggests that several mechanisms appear to be effective at different times. The first response facilitates the
recovery of the CBF through activation of the collateral
circulation and anastomotic vessels. Later, the long-term
response involves mechanisms that promote the formation of new blood vessels [45–51].
Earlier studies on the vascular response after stroke
indicated that brain collateral circulation could play a key
role after the impairment of vascular responses induced
by acute occlusion of the MCA and damage to the autoregulation mechanisms across a wide range of arterial
pressures. Meyer and Denny-Brown [52] reported a progressive dilation of pial arterioles after MCA proximal oc24

clusion with a time course of at least several hours. Halsey
and Clark [53] observed a progressive normalization of
vascular responses to hypercapnia over days and weeks
after MCA occlusion in cats. These studies suggest that
the blood flow to the cortex undergoes progressive changes, with a consequent increase according to the time following MCA occlusion. Furthermore, results reported by
Coyle and Heistad [54, 55] indicate that the main responses to brain ischemia and reperfusion are characterized by collateral blood flow through dilated vessels able
to supply blood to ischemic areas.
The increase in blood supply to the damaged tissue
may induce hemodynamic stimuli to foster new vessel
formation (neovascularization) with consequent remodeling of microvascular networks. These processes are an
integral component for carrying out reproductive and reparative functions in the adult organism; this has been
discussed in very accurate reviews published previously
[56].
These mechanisms have been underestimated for a
long time because experimental and clinical studies have
been devoted mainly to neuronal dysfunction and metabolic events. The relationship between angiogenesis and
brain function after stroke has not been studied to the
extent performed in cardiovascular research, but recent
evidence implicates an important role for neovascularization in the brain [49, 50]. Generally, the growth of new
blood vessels after stroke could be interpreted as a longterm natural defense mechanism that helps restore the
supply of oxygen and nutrients to the affected cerebral
tissue [51].
The clinical data reported by Krupinski et al. [57], who
studied brains obtained within 12 h of death from patients (aged 46–85 years) who had survived for 5–92 days
after stroke, include active angiogenesis in the penumbra
area (ischemic border). It is worth noting that, for the first
time, these authors managed to quantify microvessel density, and sprouting angiogenesis was recognized as a
mechanism involved in stroke recovery. Indeed, the substantial increase in microvessel profiles demonstrated angiogenic activity as participating with vessel collateralization for stroke recovery. Moreover, in the chorioallantoic
membrane, the cells, isolated from the stroke tissue but
not from normal brain tissue, were able to induce angiogenesis. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis indicated
that endothelial cells are at least ‘activated’ in stroke
tissue.
These first suggestions were supported by Szpak et al.
[58], who showed pronounced angiogenesis in the area of
the MCA. They carried out immunocytochemical studies

ity [26–38]. In the four-vessel occlusion method, the
physiological events due to reperfusion cannot be studied
because the vertebral artery occlusion is induced by electrocauterization [24].
The focal ischemia induced by MCA occlusion is characterized by different degrees of functional defects on the
contralateral side of the lesion. Upon histological examination, it has been found that MCA occlusion produces
small necrotic central (ischemic core) and apoptotic peripheral regions (penumbra area) [39–41]. The damage is
localized in the subcortical and cortical structures, comparable to human striatocapsular infarcts in terms of the
size and structures affected, involving the majority of the
basal ganglia or adjacent white matter. The persistent occlusion of MCA is accompanied by collateral blood flow
from the anterior or posterior arteries to the cortical
MCA territory [42]. A number of studies published during the last decade have characterized all types of damage
in great detail. In general, a very close topographic correspondence has been observed between the zone of reduced regional CBF and the area of histological abnormalities.
Transient MCA occlusion, for 2 h, achieved by the intraluminal filament method, has been described by Longa
et al. [43] and Garcia et al. [44]. In the rat, the occlusion
induces neocortex damage characterized by an ischemic
area without perfused blood vessels and a peripheral zone
with a reduced blood flow. It is possible to study the cerebral neuronal and vascular changes at different times of
reperfusion in this model.

MCA occlusion in the mouse [88]. Images were collected in vivo
through a closed cranial window, by confocal fluorescence microscopy after intravenous injection of RITC, before (a) and 30 days

rows). The images are of the same field at the same magnification

in brains from patients affected by cerebral infarct, who
died within 6 weeks of the stroke; they observed sprouting
angiogenesis in the border zone of the cerebral infarcts.
These interesting data prompted several studies on experimental models to verify vessel responses to ischemia.
Wei et al. [59] tested the hypothesis that there are significant, long-term, local vascular changes after a ministroke that could form the basis for functional recovery.
They observed vessel changes at the brain surface of rats
after ligation of the MCA superficial branches. At 30 days
after ischemia, there were substantial variations in surface
vessels, especially at the ischemic border, because collateral arterioles supplying the surface arterial networks became enlarged and tortuous. These collaterals fed areas
deprived of their normal blood supply and exhibited an
increase in blood flow due to new capillaries sprouting at
the border of the ischemic zone.
After some years, the question of the formation of new
vessels and microvascular remodeling was addressed by
Hayashi et al. [60]. In mice subjected to 30 min of MCA
occlusion by intraluminal nylon monofilament insertion,
they demonstrated vessel proliferation lasting for >21
days following cerebral ischemia. In their model, endothelial cells began mitosis as early as 1 day after reperfusion, accompanied by an increase in the expression of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-1 (Angpo-1) and Angpo-2, peaking at 7 and 3 days,
respectively. This finding is interesting for the temporal
profile of the new vessel formation and the role of different promoters of angiogenesis.

Ayata et al. [61] demonstrated CBF changes in the
acute phase after MCA occlusion in mice through an intact skull investigated by laser-speckle flowmetry. They
observed an increase in CBF within 28 days of ischemia,
accompanied by active angiogenesis at the ischemic border. However, they did not detect the formation of new
vessels in their model.
The first observation of vascular remodeling, characterized by the disappearing of vessels and the formation
of new vessels induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion,
was reported by Tomita et al. [62]. They studied the
mouse pial and cortical microcirculation via a closed cranial window, monitoring the area of focal ischemia for a
long time (≥30 days) using in vivo fluorescence microscopy. At 30 days after MCA occlusion, induced by topical
cauterization of two distal branches of the left MCA, a
tributary vessel of a vein near the occlusion disappeared
together with another undefined vessel (venule), while
new vessels, like capillaries, were detected at a distance
from the occlusion (fig. 1).
These observations of formation of new vessels led Toriumi et al. [63] to evaluate the functional role of arterioarteriolar anastomoses between the anterior cerebral artery and the MCA in mice before and after the superficial
occlusion of MCA. They utilized Mercox mixed with carbon black and rodhamine isothiocyanate dextran to visualize the microvascular networks, while red blood cell velocity was measured by FITC-labeled red blood cells.
They discussed previous observations made by Coyle and
Jokelainen [64] who enumerated 29 anterior cerebral ar-

tery and MCA junctions and reported the diameter of
these vessels (27.0 ± 2.5 μm). At 3 days after MCA occlusion, they found immature capillaries and peculiarly
shaped veins around the marginal zone of infarction.
Therefore, anastomotic vessels participate in the response
to ischemia, but the key role for the perfusion of previous
ischemic areas may be exerted by the formation of new
vessels, e.g. capillaries.
Successively, Tomita et al. [65] investigated the remodeling of microvascular networks in the ischemic area
30 days after permanent MCA occlusion (topical cauterization of two distal branches of the left MCA), utilizing
a confocal microscope to observe the mouse cerebral circulation through a closed cranial window chronically implanted over the left parietooccipital cortex. They found
that at 7 days after MCA occlusion, the blood flow was
significantly greater than under control conditions, indicating that spontaneous reperfusion after ischemia and
hyperemia occurred. Within 30 days of MCA occlusion,
marked vascular remodeling of the microvessel networks
was present in all ischemic mice. In particular, arteriolar
and venular remodeling was detected, characterized by
the disappearance of venular vessels and arteriolar lengthening (fig. 2b).
In summary, within 30 days of MCA occlusion, the
increase in CBF in particular areas is consequent to vessel
remodeling, characterized by the formation of new vessels (capillaries) and changes in the arterioles (lengthening) and venules (they disappeared). Therefore, according to these observations, it is possible to suggest that the

penumbra blood vessels are reperfused and are able to
form new vessels that supply blood to the ischemic core.
However, qualitative and quantitative data on new vessels
were not reported and are not yet available.
The role of angiogenesis was questioned by Vogel et al.
[17], who indicated that neovascularization induced in
mice does not substantially increase the total CBF. So the
real effects of neovascularization on the overall amount
or redistribution of CBF may be negligible. Their conclusions did not take into account that the net effect of neovascularization may be limited to the core of ischemic
zones and penumbra areas, where the new vessels appear
to be devoted to the recovery of tissue perfusion that is
not otherwise assured by the anastomotic arterioles. Consequently, the increase in total cerebral circulation can be
partially influenced by these processes and only involve a
very small amount of CBF.
More recently, Mostany et al. [66] reported that at 90
days of reperfusion after MCA occlusion, the mouse cerebral microvasculature does not undergo angiogenesis;
the branching nodes in their model did not increase. It is
worth noting that their observations were carried out 1.3
mm from the infarct edge. They also pointed out that
there was no rearrangement of microvessels within 90
days of injury in the mouse cerebral microvasculature
outside the infarct zone after MCA occlusion.
These conflicting data prompted new studies on vascular remodeling, a process involving the formation of
new vessels (capillaries only, capillaries and arterioles or
capillaries, arterioles and venules) and microvascular re-

Vasculotrophic Factors

The recovery of the brain after cerebral ischemia, requiring short- and long-term responses, may be induced
by hemodynamic stimuli or the release of specific molecules triggered by hypoxia. Clinical and experimental
data indicate that these responses could be the result of
changes in shear stress along the vessels involved in the
acute phase of stroke or complex interactions between
anterior and posterior vessels in the Willis’ Circle.
The endothelium is the sensor that transduces hemodynamic signals; a vessel remodels itself in response to
long-term changes in flow, so that the luminal diameter
is reshaped to maintain a constant predetermined level of
shear stress. In vitro, increases in shear stress alter the balance of endothelial-cell-derived mediators involved in
the regulation of vascular tone, hemostasis, the growth of
vascular cells and matrix production. New evidence confirms that shear stress activates a genetic program that
alters the balance of the remodeling mediators by activating the transcription of genes for factors effective in promoting vascular remodeling [68, 69]. This process occurs
through angiogenesis (the sprouting or splitting and proliferation of endothelial cells located in preexisting blood
vessels) or vasculogenesis (de novo vessel growth). Macrovascular vessels develop through arteriogenesis, i.e. the
transformation of small arterioles into larger conductance arteries. Collectively, arteriogenesis, angiogenesis
and vasculogenesis are referred to as neovascularization
[46–48].
Recently, it has been observed that the signaling mechanism of flow-induced constriction of cerebral arteries, at
Remodeling of Cerebral Microcirculation

least in some brain regions, involves the enhanced production of reactive oxygen species and cyclooxygenase
activity, and is mediated by 20-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic
acid via thromboxane/prostaglandin receptors. In particular, it has been demonstrated that the generation of reactive oxygen species, a crucial event in hypoxia, is the specific signal of the oxygen level at the mitochondria for the
release of the transactivating factors involved in neovascularization.
Many studies indicate that the reduction in the oxygen
level causes an immediate early response (i.e. within minutes/hours) which is due to the activation and production
of heat-shock proteins, cytokines, inflammatory factors
and several connected factors [70, 71]. The main regulator of hypoxia-responsive genes is hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), one of the heat-shock proteins. Upregulation of HIF-1 has been observed at 7 h after the onset of
ischemia and it increases further at 19 and 24 h, being
induced mainly in the penumbra or in the ischemic core
[69]. HIF-1 regulates the expression of a broad range of
genes, facilitating the adaptation to a low level of oxygen,
and contributing to tissue viability in the penumbra by an
increase in glucose transport and glycolysis and modulating vasomotor tone and angiogenesis. All of these genes
may potentially contribute to the recovery of the neuronal cells following cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. In
particular, HIF-1 is able to trigger VEGF gene transcription, the main effector of active angiogenesis, particularly
in ischemic penumbra [72, 73]. Indeed, several data indicate an increase in VEGF expression in the infarcted
hemisphere as early as 3 h after an ischemic insult in models of both animals and humans [54, 74, 75]. Moreover,
VEGF expression increases up to 3 or 7 days after ischemia, and the increase is colocalized with neovascularization in the penumbra area of the rodent brain [76–78].
These effects may be due to the stimulation of endothelial cells by VEGF; however, many data indicate that increased expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) that is
produced by the endothelial cells (eNOS) accompanies
the increase in VEGF expression. This eNOS-increased
activity causes a marked release of NO, inducing vessel
dilation and fostering vessel remodeling.
Indeed, the NO released in the cerebral regions can
exert both protective and deleterious effects, depending
on several factors, i.e. the NOS isoforms, the types of cells
releasing the NO and the time interval after the onset of
the ischemic brain injury. Previous data demonstrate that
immediately after brain ischemia, eNOS is protective,
mainly by promoting vasodilation; however, after ischemic insult, NO produced by neuronal NOS (nNOS) and

arrangement during stroke recovery. The role of angiogenesis has been investigated in rats submitted to transient MCA occlusion (for 2 h) and reperfusion for different time intervals (up to 30 days). The results indicate that
remodeling of microvascular networks implicate the formation of new arterioles sprouting from penumbra vessels and overlapping the ischemic core. Therefore, stroke
recovery is related to the formation of new vessels and the
remodeling of arteriolar vessels able to supply blood to
the ischemic area of the brain [67]. New arterioles and
capillaries appear to play a key role in the response to
ischemia, and venules participate to a lesser extent. However, there are still many questions to be addressed, such
as the role of angiogenetic factors in arteriolar and capillary sprouting and venular behavior after stroke, with
their specific effects on remodeling.

basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), a biologically active polypeptide with mitogenic, angiogenic and neurotrophic proprieties, capable of offering protection against
in vivo and in vitro hypoxic or ischemic insult and enhancing the recovery of rat behavior following traumatic
brain injury. During focal cerebral ischemia induced by
MCA occlusion, there is an increased expression of both
bFGF mRNA and bFGF protein, corresponding to a
marked angiogenesis in the rat ischemic cortex [84]. Lin
et al. [85] demonstrated that, in rats subjected to ischemia
and reperfusion, there was a significant increase in bFGF
mRNA, observed as early as 60 min after ischemia and
remaining elevated for up to 2 weeks after the onset of
reperfusion.
During angiogenesis, an upregulation of Angpo-1 and
Angpo-2 has been reported, resulting in an increase in
Angpo-1 and Angpo-2 mRNA expression during the early phase of ischemia. In particular, an increase in the Angpo-2 mRNA level accompanies the expression of VEGF
during the same period, providing a drive for sprouting
angiogenesis. However, the relative importance of Angpo-1 and Angpo-2 expression requires further studies, in
order to conclusively indicate whether the dominance of
Angpo-1 late in vascular remodeling could represent a
shift in the gene expression profile toward vessel stabilization, thereby assuming the relative dominance of Angpo-1 and Angpo-2 as an index of vessel stabilization rather than angiogenic sprouting [85, 86].
Finally, vascular cells can modulate the structure and
composition of the extracellular matrix by producing enzymes involved in the degradation of the matrix proteins.
These proteins, indeed, play an important role in modulating cell function, in addition to providing structural
support. Certain matrix proteins bind growth factors,
such as bFGF, transforming growth factor β1 and thrombin, modulating the growth of vascular cells. Therefore,
the fine regulation of vascular cell growth, representing
the fundamental mechanism of vascular remodeling, involves an interaction between growth factors and matrix
proteins (fig. 3) [87, 88].

Conclusions

Numerous studies have attempted to clarify the vascular events taking place during brain ischemia and reperfusion. Undoubtedly, ischemia and the subsequent reperfusion involve complex vascular and cellular processes that
occur at different stages. After an ischemic insult, there is
an immediate response to the reduction of blood flow that

later NO release by the novo expression of inducible NOS
(iNOS) contribute to the damage to the brain [79–81].
Immunohistochemical studies, utilizing specific polyclonal antibodies for eNOS, nNOS and iNOS in rats, reveal that eNOS immunoreactivity is consistent in the
large vessels and increases gradually after MCA occlusion
and peak at 48 h, whereas nNOS-positive neurons increase in the ipsilateral hemisphere and iNOS immunoreactivity is detected in microvessels at 6 h after MCA
occlusion.
In a rat model of transient MCA occlusion (for 2 h)
and reperfusion for different time intervals, recent data
indicate that microvascular remodeling is accompanied
by an increase in the expression of VEGF at day 1 of reperfusion, peaking at 7 days, is high at 14 days and has
decreased at 28 days of reperfusion in the cortex and striatum of the affected hemisphere. Moreover, there was an
increase in the expression of nNOS and iNOS, with nNOS
expression being markedly increased at 1 and 7 days of
reperfusion, which indicates pronounced neuronal damage in the first days after ischemia, as has previously been
suggested [59, 79]. The increase in the expression of iNOS
at 1 and 7 days, that markedly decreases up to 28 days of
reperfusion, may indicate the activation of the inflammatory mechanisms by ischemia. Several data, indeed, indicate that the inhibition of iNOS expression by aminoguanidine is able to reduce infarct size in brain ischemic injury; therefore, the increase in iNOS appears to contribute
to the tissue inflammation triggered by ischemia [82, 83].
Generally, all NOS isoforms are activated with different time-dependent involvement, likely indicating a complex interaction between the expression of VEGF and
NOS isoforms. Indeed, it has been suggested that VEGF
is a common trigger of the activation of all NOS isoforms
[48]; however, it has been found that the time-dependent
expression of VEGF and eNOS strictly correspond [67].
Therefore, it is most likely that eNOS and VEGF are involved in the cerebral vascular remodeling after ischemic
insult, even though the spatial and temporal dynamics of
cerebral microvascular rearrangement after stroke are
complex and have not yet been completely characterized.
Finally, data reported in several studies show the recovery of neuronal function 30 days after MCA occlusion
[79–81]. Neuronal recovery is therefore accompanied by
vascular remodeling, indicating the relative relationships
between the two key processes that improve outcome after stroke.
Experimental studies have demonstrated that other
factors may be involved in the repair and maintenance of
residual disabled tissue after cerebral ischemia, such as

remodeling

promotes the activation of collateral circulation. These
collateral vessels promote the redistribution of blood towards ischemic areas, thereby promoting the first response to the decrease in perfusion. According to data
reported by Tomita et al. [65], it is important to note that
several trophic factors released after ischemia contribute
to widespread angiogenesis and vascular remodeling,
representing the long-term response to ischemia and reperfusion. This trophic factor activation appears to be
crucial for promoting the sprouting of new vessels during
stroke recovery. The key molecule, activated by hypoxia
and able to induce an increase in the VEGF and eNOS
expression, appears to be HIF-1; it plays a major role in
triggering the cascade of molecular mechanisms that facilitate the formation and rearrangement of vessels. The
overall effects of these mechanisms modulate angiogenesis in the brain with the formation of new vessels (arteriolar anastomosis and capillaries) and the rearrangement of venular vessels. These changes in vascular net-

works enhance the long-term functional neurological
outcome after stroke. It is still not clear whether the neurons in the previous ischemic zone are preexistent cells
that can be reactivated by an adequate blood supply or if
they are neurons of new origin. Nevertheless, cerebral microvessel remodeling is accompanied by improved neurological behavior [89, 90].
In conclusion, the stroke complex scenario still requires further study to clarify all of the molecular mechanisms involved that are effective in improving vascular
rearrangement in response to ischemia and reperfusion
injury. At the moment, we know that the first response
triggers a cascade of events which enable the redistribution of blood to ischemic areas and induce the release of
trophic factors. These molecules promote vascular remodeling (the long-term response), with the formation of
new vessels (arterioles and capillaries) and the rearrangement of venous vessels. This vascular rearrangements result in a positive recovery from stroke.
