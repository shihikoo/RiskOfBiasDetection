peroxynitrite/AMPK by S‑nitrosoglutathione:
implication for stroke therapy

Abstract 
Background:  Stroke immediately sets into motion sustained excitotoxicity and calcium dysregulation, causing
aberrant activity in neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and an imbalance in the levels of nitric oxide (NO). Drugs
targeting nNOS-originated toxicity may therefore reduce stroke-induced damage. Recently, we observed that a redoxmodulating agent of the NO metabolome, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), confers neurovascular protection by reducing the levels of peroxynitrite, a product of aberrant NOS activity. We therefore investigated whether GSNO-mediated
neuroprotection and improved neurological functions depend on blocking nNOS/peroxynitrite-associated injurious
mechanisms using a rat model of cerebral ischemia reperfusion (IR).
Results:  IR increased the activity of nNOS, the levels of neuronal peroxynitrite and phosphorylation at Ser1412 of
nNOS. GSNO treatment of IR animals decreased IR-activated nNOS activity and neuronal peroxynitrite levels by reducing nNOS phosphorylation at Ser1412. The Ser1412 phosphorylation is associated with increased nNOS activity. Supporting the notion that nNOS activity and peroxynitrite are deleterious following IR, inhibition of nNOS by its inhibitor
7-nitroindazole or reducing peroxynitrite by its scavenger FeTPPS decreased IR injury. GSNO also decreased the activation of AMP Kinase (AMPK) and its upstream kinase LKB1, both of which were activated in IR brain. AMPK has been
implicated in nNOS activation via Ser1412 phosphorylation. To determine whether AMPK activation is deleterious in the
acute phase of IR, we treated animals after IR with AICAR (an AMPK activator) and compound c (an AMPK inhibitor).
While AICAR potentiated, compound c reduced the IR injury.
Conclusions:  Taken together, these results indicate an injurious nNOS/peroxynitrite/AMPK cycle following stroke,
and GSNO treatment of IR inhibits this vicious cycle, resulting in neuroprotection and improved neurological function.
GSNO is a natural component of the human body, and its exogenous administration to humans is not associated with
any known side effects. Currently, the FDA-approved thrombolytic therapy suffers from a lack of neuronal protective
activity. Because GSNO provides neuroprotection by ameliorating stroke’s initial and causative injuries, it is a candidate
of translational value for stroke therapy.

however, even greater apoptotic neuronal damage is
caused by nitroxidative stress and neuroinflammation in
the cortical penumbra and hippocampal areas [1]. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-derived nitroxidative
stress occurs due to calcium homeostasis derailment,

functional recovery [2, 3]. Other than thrombolysis by
tissue plasminogen activator, which offers only a short
window of treatment (~3–4  h) beyond which severe
damage results, an effective neuroprotective stroke therapy is not available mainly due to limited understanding
of the initial nitroxidative signaling mechanisms of the
disease [1].
nNOS contributes approximately 90% to NOS activity
in normal rodents [4]. Of the three known nitric oxide
synthases, nNOS activity plays a critical role in neuronal cell death during the acute ischemia reperfusion
(IR) phase [5]. Inhibition of nNOS activity following IR
[5, 6] has been shown to be neuroprotective and nNOS
KO mice show reduced infarct volume [4, 7–10], indicating that nNOS plays a significant role in IR injury. Like
nNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase is also aberrantly
activated early after stroke. However, endothelial nitric
oxide synthase is localized primarily in endothelium and
endothelial nitric oxide synthase -derived NO, via peroxynitrite, has been associated with blood–brain barrier leakage, cerebral hemorrhage and edema [11–13]. In
rodent, inducible nitric oxide synthase is expressed from
~12  h to several days after IR and its immunoreactivity
is present mainly in inflammatory cells and endothelium [14–16]. Therefore, the focus of this acute IR study
is to investigate the mechanisms of nNOS regulation for
developing stroke therapy.
Recent reports document that S-nitrosylation of nNOS
regulates its activity [11, 17], in addition to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation [18]. In resting neurons, nNOS
is inhibited mainly by S-nitrosylation of Cys331; however, immediately following stroke injury, nNOS is activated by NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity and a
sustained calcium influx through site-specific phosphorylation (Ser1412) and denitrosylation (Cys331). In such an
environment, nNOS-derived NO is converted to peroxynitrite by an instantaneous diffusion-limited reaction
with superoxide [19]. Peroxynitrite can activate AMPK
via the activation of upstream AMPK kinase LKB1, thus
maintaining a vicious cycle of its own production [20].
The interplay between nNOS and neuronal AMPK during the acute phase of stroke is now recognized to contribute to neuronal loss [21]. AMPK is a cellular energy
sensor and an important potential target for stroke treatment. However, the timing, duration and degree of its
activation are critical for the outcome of stroke injury
[21, 22]. AMPK is activated during decreased cellular
energy supply (AMP vs. ATP ratio). It is highly expressed
in neurons (AMPKα2) and is rapidly activated in an
energy-deprived status such as that which follows stroke
[23]. Its activation during the acute phase of IR is deleterious; indeed, both pharmacological inhibition and gene
deletion of AMPK were found to be neuroprotective [23].

AMPK has been reported to phosphorylate nNOS [24,
25]. During acute IR disease with dysregulated calcium
flux, AMPK activation possibly keeps nNOS hyperactivated via sustained phosphorylation of Ser1412 of nNOS.
This phenomenon results in Cys331 denitrosylation,
leading to sustained peroxynitrite formation and thus
peroxynitrite-mediated neuronal loss. In contrast to peroxynitrite, an endogenous signaling molecule of the NO
metabolome, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), has been
documented to reduce the levels of peroxynitrite as well
as neuronal cell death in a number of neurodegenerative
diseases, including stroke [11, 26, 27], traumatic brain
injury [28, 29] and vascular dementia [30]. It can inhibit
the activity of nNOS under excitotoxic conditions via
the S-nitrosylation of Cys331 of nNOS [17, 18], leading to
reduced formation of peroxynitrite.
GSNO executes its action mainly via S-nitrosylation
of target proteins [31]. In stroke pathology, the levels
of GSNO and the consequent S-nitrosylated proteins
are believed to decrease due to four major reasons: (a)
decreased oxygen supply under ischemic/hypoxic condition reduces GSNO biosynthesis; (b) excessive superoxide
formed during reperfusion instantaneously reacts with
nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-derived NO, forming peroxynitrite and thus reducing NO bioavailability for GSNO
biosynthesis; (c) biosynthesis of GSNO is decreased as
a result of reduced levels of glutathione (redox imbalance) and NO (due to its reaction with superoxide) under
IR conditions. Furthermore, NO reacts slowly with glutathione as compared with superoxide [32]; and (d) in the
inflammatory environment, the expression of the GSNOdegrading enzyme GSNO reductase is increased [33],
leading to reduced levels of GSNO. Therefore, the subject
of investigation for this study was the exogenous supplementation of GSNO to down regulate the aberrant activity of nNOS and AMPK, leading to neuroprotection and
functional recovery.
The overall goal of the present study is to investigate
whether GSNO provides neuroprotection by reducing
the levels of peroxynitrite via the inhibition of nNOS
activity. Our initial studies show that treatment of IR
animals with GSNO reduced phosphorylation at Ser1412,
possibly via the inhibition of LKB1 and AMPK activities, and thus attenuated nNOS activity and peroxynitrite-mediated brain injury. The GSNO treatment also
improved neurological functions.

Evaluation of ischemic infarct

Animals were male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing
between 250 and 290 g at the time of surgery. Number of
animals used in this study is described in figure legends.
All animals received humane care in compliance with the
Medical University of South Carolina’s (MUSC) guidance
and the National Research Council’s criteria for humane
care. Animal procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of MUSC.

Coronal sections  (2  mm) were immersed in 1% solution of TTC in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4)
at 37°C for 15  min, as described previously [36]. After
staining, infarctions were measured using Scion Image
software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD, USA). Total
infarct area was multiplied by the thickness of the brain
sections to obtain infarct volume, as described previously [27]. In order to minimize the error introduced
by edema and liquefaction after infarction, an indirect
method for calculating infarct volume was used [35, 37].
The non-infarcted area in the ipsilateral hemisphere was
subtracted from that in the contralateral hemisphere,
and infarct volume was calculated using the following
formula: corrected percentage of infarct volume = (contralateral hemispheric volume − ipsilateral non-infarcted
volume)/contralateral hemispheric volume.

Experimental groups, drugs and dose

Evaluation of neurological score

The animals were randomly divided into  eight groups:
(1) ischemia reperfusion treated with vehicle (IR), (2)
IR  +  GSNO treatment (GSNO), (3) IR  +  compound c
treatment (Comp c), (4) IR + AICAR treatment (AICAR),
(5) IR + FeTPPS treatment (FeTPPS), (6) IR + 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) treatment, (7) IR + AICAR + GSNO, and
(8) sham-operated treated with vehicle (Sham). The number of animals used in each experiment is indicated in figure legends. In the GSNO treatment group, the rats were
administered freshly prepared GSNO (0.25  mg/kg body
weight), which was dissolved in sterile saline (~250  μl)
and administered intravenously slowly at reperfusion or
as stated. While 7-NI (50 mg/kg ip) was administered at
the reperfusion, AICAR (500 mg/kg, ip), Comp c (20 mg/
kg, ip) and FeTPPS (3  mg/kg, iv) were administered 1  h
after reperfusion. The dosage of treatment was based
on our previously reported dose response curve study
in a rat model of IR or effective dose reported in stroke
IR models [11, 23, 34]. Physiological parameters did not
alter after the treatments. Details of the study on physiologic parameters in IR rats have been reported earlier
[26].

Neurological deficits were evaluated by an observer
blinded to the identity of the groups. A neurological
grading system with a 4-point scale (0–3), as described
previously [27], was used: 0, no observable neurological
deficit (normal); 1, failure to extend right forepaw on lifting the whole body by tail (mild); 2, circling to the contralateral side (moderate); 3, leaning to the contralateral
side at rest or no spontaneous motor activity (severe).
The animals not showing paralysis at 1  h after middle
cerebral artery occlusion were excluded from the study
because the reduction of blood flow may not have produced an infarction of adequate size to cause quantifiable
neurological deficits in those animals.

Animals

Middle cerebral artery occlusion rat model

Rats were anesthetized by ketamine hydrochloride
(90  mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (10  mg/kg body
weight) administered ip. Stroke was induced for 60  min
by left middle cerebral artery occlusion using an intraluminal filament as previously described [26, 35]. To ensure
the obstruction, regional cerebral blood flow was monitored during the occlusion and early reperfusion [26].
Reperfusion was established by withdrawal of the filament. After specified time points, animals were sacrificed
with an overdose of ketamine hydrochloride.

Histological evaluation

At hour 4 post-IR, the animals were sacrificed and perfused before the brain was fixed in 10% formalin. The
tissue was processed for histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) as previously described [36]. The brain
sections (8 µM thick) were stained as described [36] with
Nissl, Bielschowsky’s silver, H&E. The histological analysis was performed in the penumbra area by an investigator who was blinded to the experimental group. While
Nissl staining determines neuronal cell damage, H&E
indicates overall tissue damage. Bielschowsky’s silver
staining provides indication of the loss of axonal integrity.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis

Paraffin-embedded sections from the formalin-fixed
brain tissues were stained for 3-NT (Abcam Cat# ab7048,
RRID:AB_305725) and NeuN (Merck Cat# MAB377,
RRID:AB_11210778), as described previously [29]. In brief,
the brain tissue sections were deparaffinized, sequentially
rehydrated in graded alcohol, and then immersed in PBS

Khan et al. BMC Neurosci (2015) 16:42

(pH 7.4). Slides were then microwaved in antigen unmasking solution (Vector Labs), cooled and washed 3 times
for 2  min in PBS. Slides were then blocked by 5% non-fat
dry milk in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Sections
were incubated overnight with antibodies of 3-NT and
NSE. They were then rinsed 3 times for 5 min in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Secondary anti-mouse IgG, conjugated with Texas red (Vector Laboratories Cat# TI-2000,
RRID:AB_2336178) for 3-NT and secondary anti-rabbit
IgG, conjugated with FITC (Vector Laboratories Cat#
FI-1000, RRID:AB_2336197) for NSE were incubated on
slides for 60 min. All sections were examined for immunoreactivity in the penumbra area using an Olympus microscope
equipped for epifluorescence and DP Controller software.
Figures were compiled in Adobe Photoshop software.
For double labeling, sections were incubated first with
an antibody of 3-NT followed by NSE. For immunofluorescent double-labeling, immune complexes were visualized with anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories Cat#
TI-2000, RRID:AB_2336178) and anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories Cat# FI-1000, RRID:AB_2336197). In
another set of experiments, sections were also incubated
with FITC or Texas Red conjugated IgG without the primary antibody as a negative control to confirm the specificity of the primary antibody. Slides were examined for
immunofluorescence using an Olympus microscope
equipped with an epifluorescence filter and Adobe Photoshop software [29].
Western blot analysis

Western blot was performed using fresh or frozen tissue, as previously described [11]. The following antibodies were used; phospho-Thr172-AMPKα (Cell Signaling
Technology Cat# 2535S RRID:AB_331250), AMPKα (Cell
Signaling Technology Cat# 2532S RRID:AB_10694064),
phospho-Ser79-ACC Cell Signaling Technology Cat#
3661S RRID:AB_330337) and phospho-Ser428-LKB1 (Cell
Signaling Technology Cat# 3482S RRID:AB_2198321),
nNOS (Abcam Cat# ab1376 RRID:AB_300614), phospho
nNOS Ser1417, equivalent to human Ser1412 (Abcam Cat#
ab90443 RRID:AB_2049208) and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich
Cat# A3853 RRID:AB_262137), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Cat# 111-035-045
RRID:AB_2337938). Protein concentrations were determined using protein assay dye from Bio-Rad Laboratories
(Hercules, CA). Densitometry of protein expression was
performed using a GS800 calibrated densitometer from
Bio-Rad laboratories (Hercules, CA).
NOS activity assay

NOS activity in the penumbra brain area was determined
by the conversion of L-[4,5-3H] arginine (American

Page 4 of 12

Radiolabeled, Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) to L-[4,5-3H]
citrulline in the presence or absence of the competitive
NOS inhibitor L-NAME using an NOS assay kit from
Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI) and following the
instructions described therein. Total cNOS activity was
determined by subtracting calcium independent NOS
activity. The nNOS inhibitor, 7-NI (50  mg/kg), and the
NOS inhibitor, L-NAME (30  mg/kg), were used to differentiate between endothelial nitric oxide synthase and
nNOS activity [38]. The activity was expressed as pmol/
mg protein/min.
NO assay

The levels of NO (as nitrite) in the penumbral brain
area were determined using a Roche’s test “Nitric oxide
colorimetric assay” kit. The estimation was based on
the following reaction: nitrites  +  sulfanilamide  +
N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylene-diamine dihydrochloride and
yields a reddish-violet diazo dye whose absorbance was
measured in the visible range at 540  nm. The assay was
performed as described by the manufacturer.
Statistical evaluation

Statistical analysis was performed using Graph pad prism
5.01 software [39]. Statistical significance was determined
using paired or unpaired students’ t test as appropriate or
one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc for three or more
groups. Values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
GSNO inhibits nNOS activity and decreases the levels
of neuronal peroxynitrite (3‑nitrotyrosine; 3‑NT)
following IR

Increased nNOS activity and the participation of nNOSderived peroxynitrite in stroke injury have been reported
[7]. However, the timing and the relationship of peroxynitrite formation with neuronal degeneration are less
understood. Furthermore, the mechanisms of nNOS
regulation by products of the NO metabolome, including
GSNO, are not clear. We observed an increased degree
of nNOS activity (p  <  0.001) as early as 1  h after reperfusion, and the treatment with GSNO at 0  h after reperfusion significantly decreased (p  <  0.001) the nNOS
activity (Figure  1a). The increased nNOS activity correlated with the decreased levels (p < 0.001) of NO in the
IR brain (Figure  1b), indicating that NO is being consumed by superoxide to make peroxynitrite. Accordingly, enhanced expression of 3-NT (Figure  1c, as a
marker of peroxynitrite) was observed in neurons from
IR brain (Figure  1d, colocalization of 3-NT with neuronal marker NeuN). GSNO treatment of IR not only

increased NO bioavailability (p  <  0.05 vs. IR, Figure  1b)
but also reduced the expression of 3-NT, thus suggesting
that GSNO inhibited nNOS activity. Previously, we have
also reported increased levels of 3-NT at 4 h [11] as well
as 24  h [26] following IR. These results indicate that IR
brain accumulates and maintains sustained levels of peroxynitrite in the acute phase of IR.
GSNO reduces neuronal degeneration and protects axon/
tissue integrity following IR

To examine whether GSNO-mediated decreased levels
of peroxynitrite in IR brain correlate with neuroprotection, we evaluated neuronal degeneration using Nissl
(Figure  2a), axonal integrity using Bielschowsky silver
(Figure  2b), and tissue structure using H&E (Figure  2c)
in the fixed brain sections at 4  h after IR. Nissl staining

showed a remarkable number of degenerating neurons in
IR (indicated by black arrow); these levels were reduced
in the GSNO group (blue arrow showing intact neurons). Bielschowsky silver staining is a marker of axonal
integrity. It was also reduced in IR (Figure 2b). The treatment with GSNO protected axonal integrity, as indicated
by the enhanced staining of Bielschowsky silver in the
GSNO brain. H&E staining showed that IR-mediated
tissue deformation (red arrow) and pyknosis of neurons
(black arrow) were blocked by GSNO treatment. These
data indicate that GSNO provides neuroprotection.

influx through site specific phosphorylation (Ser1412)
[18]. In such an environment, nNOS-derived NO is converted to peroxynitrite by an instantaneous diffusion
limited reaction with superoxide [19]. Peroxynitrite, in
turn, maintains aberrant activity of nNOS via oxidative
mechanisms. We investigated whether GSNO inhibits nNOS activity as shown in Figure  1a via the reversal
of phosphorylation (Ser1412). We observed IR-induced
increased levels (p  <  0.001) of phosphorylated Ser1412 at
1  h of reperfusion (Figure  3a, b), resulting in increased
nNOS activity as shown in Figure  1a, thus rendering nNOS “aberrant” and causing sustained accumulation of peroxynitrite (Figure  1c). GSNO treatment of IR
decreased the levels the IR-induced phosphorylation
of Ser1412 (p  <  0.001, Figure  3a, b), resulting in reduced
nNOS activity (Figure  1a) as well as decreased levels of
neuronal peroxynitrite (Figure 1c, d).
nNOS inhibitor 7‑NI treatment of IR provides limited
protection compared with GSNO following IR

7-NI, a selective nNOS inhibitor, is reported to reduce
infarct volume in IR models [6, 40]. However, its efficacy
is limited due to irreversible nNOS inhibition and a narrow therapeutic window of treatment [40]. We compared
the efficacy of 7-NI with GSNO after administering both

drugs at 1  h of reperfusion. Treatment with both drugs
significantly reduced brain infarctions (p  <  0.001, Figure 4a–c) compared with IR, determined at 24 h after IR.
However, the efficacy of GSNO was greater than 7-NI
in terms of reduction of infarct volume (p  <  0.001, Figure  4c). Furthermore, GSNO and not 7-NI significantly
improved neurological score (p < 0.01, Figure 4d).
IR‑induced AMPK activation is reversed by GSNO treatment
following IR

nNOS activation occurs via phosphorylation of Ser1412
and thus its increased activity is regulated by several
kinases, including Akt and AMPK. While Akt is inhibited
[20], AMPK is activated following IR [23]. Peroxynitrite is
known to activate AMPK via its upstream kinase LKB1,
thus increasing nNOS activity. Consistent with previous
reports, we observed IR-induced activation of AMPK
(pAMPK), which was blunted by GSNO treatment of IR
as shown by western analysis (p < 0.001, Figure 5b, b′) at
1 h after reperfusion. GSNO also inhibited (p < 0.001) IRinduced activation of LKB1, (Figure  5a, a′) and ACC, a
substrate of AMPK (Figure 5b, b′).
AMPK inhibitor Comp c and peroxynitrite scavenger
FeTPPS decrease whereas AMPK activator AICAR increases
the injury following IR

AMPK activation in the acute phase of IR is deleterious,
and these injurious effects are linked with increased peroxynitrite levels [23, 41]. Peroxynitrite activates AMPK

through LKB1activity which, in turn, may phosphorylate nNOS(Ser1412), leading to peroxynitrite formation.
We observed that the AMPK inhibitor Comp c as well
as the peroxynitrite scavenger FeTPPS-treated animals
(at 1  h after IR) had significantly reduced (p  <  0.001)
infarct volume (Figure 6a) and improved (p < 0.001) neurological score (Figure  6b). In contrast, the AMPK activator AICAR treated animals at 1  h after reperfusion
had increased (p  <  0.001) levels of infarct volume and a
higher (p  <  0.001) degree of neurological deficits (Figure  6a, b). However, AICAR animals prior-treated with
GSNO (at 0 h of reperfusion) had less (p < 0.001) injury
and reduced (p  <  0.001) neurological deficits compared
with AICAR-alone animals. However, AICAR  +  GSNO
group had significantly more (p  <  0.001) infarct volume
and neurological deficits. As previously reported [26],
GSNO treatment of IR showed remarkable (p < 0.001 vs.
IR) neuroprotection and functional recovery (p  <  0.001
vs. IR) when administered at reperfusion (Figure 6a, b).

Discussion
Stroke is one of the most disabling conditions in the
United States. The most severe injury after ischemia or
reperfusion happens within a couple of hours of initial
stroke, leading to the wisdom in stroke care that “time
is brain” [42]. This concept demands focus on the initial
critical events and their injury mechanisms for developing an effective therapy using clinically relevant animal
models.

Neuroimaging data in patients who have stroke or transient ischemic attack show that the territory of the middle cerebral artery branches suffers from multiple infarcts
more frequently than other areas [43]. Inflammation and
secondary brain damage also occur in similar areas after
inappropriate thrombolytic therapy [44]. Therefore, we
used a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. Animal models of focal cerebral
ischemia using the middle cerebral artery occlusion technique are recognized as physiologically relevant to stroke
in humans [45, 46]. After stroke, the core injury site dies;
however, the area surrounding the core (penumbra)
survives if treated and perfused properly. Therefore, we
selected salvageable penumbra tissue for this study. Our
previous studies have shown that the GSNO-mediated
mechanisms reduced peroxynitrite levels and inflammation, protected against blood–brain barrier leakage, and
improved neurobehavioral function; however, the mechanisms of GSNO-mediated down regulation of peroxynitrite-induced injury in IR are not well understood. nNOS
activation due to calcium dysregulation and excitotoxicity has been documented among the causative factors
in stroke [18], and the mechanism of S-nitrosylation has

Khan et al. BMC Neurosci (2015) 16:42

been shown to inhibit nNOS activity [17]. Therefore, we
hypothesized that GSNO treatment of IR reduces nNOS
activity and peroxynitrite levels, leading to neuroprotection and functional recovery as depicted in Figure 7.
Early neuronal cell death in IR is caused by nNOS activation and peroxynitrite formation [7]. Peroxynitrite
(3-NT)-positive neurons are more susceptible to cell
death [47], indicating that reducing neuronal peroxynitrite may translate into reduced neuronal cell death, leading to tissue protection and functional improvements.
In neurons, peroxynitrite originates from excitotoxicity-induced aberrant nNOS activity [7]. nNOS activity is dynamically regulated by NO metabolome, which
includes GSNO. NO from nNOS forms GSNO, if superoxide levels are low; however, peroxynitrite is formed
when superoxide levels significantly exceed NO levels
[48, 49]. Peroxynitrite can keep nNOS under sustained

excitotoxicity and calcium dysregulation cause aberrant nNOS activation, peroxynitrite formation and LKB1/AMPK activation. GSNO treatment of IR blocks the vicious cycle by inhibiting the aberrant activity
of nNOS and LKB1/AMPK, leading to neuroprotection and improved
neurobehavioral function.

aberrant activation status via the up regulation of phosphorylation of Ser1412, thus maintaining its own formation and causing sustained neuronal cell death. In this
study, we tested whether GSNO down regulates aberrant nNOS activity by reducing the levels of peroxynitrite
through reversing peroxynitrite-induced phosphorylation/dephosphoryaltion mechanisms as elucidated in
Figure 7.
nNOS activation requires NMDA-receptor-mediated
Ca2+ influx, leading to secondary modification of nNOS,
such as denitrosylation of Cys331, and phosphorylation of
Ser1412 [50]. Several kinases, including CaMKIIα, PKA,
Akt (PKB), and AMPK, and phosphatases, including PP1,
PP2A, and PP2B, have been reported to be involved in
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser1412 [24,
47, 50–54], but their regulation by peroxynitrite and
GSNO is not understood. We observed that IR induced
increased levels of phosphorylated Ser1412 as early as 1 h
following IR (Figure  3). IR also increased nNOS activity
(Figure  1a) and neuronal peroxynitrite levels (Figure  1c,
d). These IR-induced effects were blunted by GSNO
treatment of IR as shown by reduced levels of peroxynitrite (measured as 3-NT expression) (Figure  1c, d)
and reduced levels of phosphorylated Ser1412 (Figure  3).
GSNO also reduces neuronal loss and maintains axonal
integrity (Figure 2). Inhibition of nNOS by 7-NI, a selective nNOS inhibitor, has previously been shown to provide neuroprotection as it reduces infarct volume in IR
models [40]. However, the efficacy of 7-NI is limited due
to irreversible nNOS inhibition and narrow therapeutic window of treatment [6, 40]. We observed reduced
infarct volume in 7-NI animals compared with IR; however, GSNO-treated animals had a significantly greater
decrease in the infract volume (Figure 4) compared with
the 7-NI. GSNO, but not 7-NI, also improved neurological score (Figure  4). Furthermore, 7-NI treatment of IR
has been shown to significantly reduce cerebral blood
flow [55], indicating that sustained and suicidal inhibition of nNOS may have drastically reduced the NO levels
required for blood flow as well as for other NO-dependent physiological function. Contrary to 7-NI, GSNO
increases NO bioavailability (Figure  1b), enhances the
blood flow and mimics several beneficial functions of
NOS-derived NO [26]. Moreover, GSNO maintains the
homeostasis of the NO metabolome by regulating nNOS
activity in a reversible (feedback) manner via S-nitrosylation and signaling mechanisms through the regulation of
its kinases.
Decreased activation of AMPK and reduced IR injury
in nNOS KO mice indicate that AMPK activation is
dependent on nNOS activity [23]. AMPK activity has
been reported to phosphorylate Ser1412 of nNOS, thus
increasing nNOS activity. Unlike AMPK, Akt is inhibited

Khan et al. BMC Neurosci (2015) 16:42

following IR in a time dependent manner, likely by peroxynitrite [20]. Our data showing decreased activity of
LKB1, AMPK and ACC by GSNO indicate that GSNO
can reduce nNOS activity through the reversal of AMPK
activation (Figure  5). These observations indicate that
peroxynitrite, nNOS and AMPK activities participate in
a vicious cycle leading to neuronal loss and functional
deficits. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that activation of AMPK could result in detrimental outcomes and
that restraining AMPK activity confers neuroprotective
effects in certain types of brain injury, such as stroke
and Alzheimer’s disease [41, 56]. On the one hand, activation of AMPK in response to cellular stress is considered protective and has been established as important in
enhancing the lifespan based on studies primarily from
non-mammalian systems [57, 58]; additionally, the antiaging effects of AMPK activation have been proposed
to protect against neurodegenerative diseases [59]. It is
hypothesized that the metabolic consequences of sustained and aberrant activation of AMPK in the absence
of energy deficiency is distinct from those during stress
(ATP depletion) conditions. Moreover, the outcome of
AMPK activation is dependent on its substrate and the
micro environment. Hypoxia/ischemia increases AMPK
phosphorylation and the activity which is likely independent of cytosolic AMP levels [23, 41]. IR-mediated
deleterious activity of AMPK may result from direct
phosphorylation of Thr172 by its upstream kinase LKB1.
Peroxynitrite has been reported to be potent activator of
LKB1/AMPK [60]. In such a case, the ability of AMPK
to maintain energy homeostasis would be overwhelmed,
and its detrimental effects would in turn be amplified. On
the other hand, activation of AMPK in response to therapeutic activation or modest and transient stress, including therapeutic exercises, would likely be protective in
restoring the homeostasis of energy metabolism.
Our data on nNOS and AMPK are consistent with the
notion that sustained activation of AMPK results in detrimental effects in stroke [23, 41]. AMPK activation leads
to the aberrant activation of nNOS, which in turn produces peroxynitrite, the strongest oxidizing agent, causing neuronal cell death. AMPK inhibition, resulting in
neuroprotection and reduced levels of peroxynitrite, supports the hypothesis that AMPK activation in the acute
phase of stroke is associated with injury. The injurious
role of AMPK in the acute phase of IR was supported by
our data showing severe injury in AICAR, an AMPK activator, treated animals and reduced injury than IR in compound c, an AMPK inhibitor, treated animals (Figure 6).
Significantly reduced infarct volume and decreased
functional deficits in peroxynitrite scavenger FeTPPStreated animals provide further evidence that the deleterious effect of nNOS/AMPK activities was caused by

Page 10 of 12

peroxynitrite (Figure  6). Because peroxynitrite activates
AMPK via its upstream kinase LKB1 [60] and LKB1 activation can thus be down regulated by GSNO through
reducing the levels of peroxynitrite in an nNOS inhibition-dependent pathway, GSNO shows potential to down
regulate the nNOS/peroxynitrite/AMPK vicious cycle as
depicted in Figure 7.

Conclusions
In the present study, we have shown that the nNOS/peroxynitrite/AMPK vicious cycle is an attractive therapeutic target for stroke therapy. The study provides evidence
that GSNO-mediated mechanisms of phosphorylation
and dephosphorylation of nNOS and AMPK, in inhibiting aberrant nNOS and thus reducing peroxynitrite,
protected against neuronal loss and aided in functional
recovery following IR (Figure 7). GSNO is a natural molecule in the human brain and body, and its exogenous
administration has not shown any evident toxicity or side
effects in animals and humans [61, 62]. Therefore, GSNO
seems to be an ideal interventional drug to provide neuroprotection and stimulate functional recovery in stroke.
