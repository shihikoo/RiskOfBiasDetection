Key Points

Introduction
Plasminogen activators are the only thrombolytic agents approved to
rapidly revascularize a thrombosed vessel. Reperfusion of the ischemiaaffected organ leads to an improved outcome in patients when applied
within the ﬁrst hours after ischemic onset.1 Despite this evidence-based
beneﬁcial effect, current thrombolytic agents remain widely underutilized due to life-threatening side effects such as cerebral hemorrhages
and possible neurotoxicity.2,3 For acute ischemic stroke, in particular,
the only licensed treatment option consists of a high systemic dose of
recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), which is actually
given to ,10% of the patients. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical
need to explore novel therapeutic avenues to enhance ﬁbrinolysis without plasminogen activator–associated adverse effects. Endogenous
intravascular ﬁbrinolysis is driven on the release of tPA from the
endothelium, which in turn enzymatically activates plasminogen
into the ﬁbrin-degrading enzyme, plasmin.4 This activation step is
attenuated by circulating thrombin-activatable ﬁbrinolysis inhibitor
(TAFI) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Activated
TAFI (TAFIa; encoded by the CPB2 gene) eliminates C-terminal Lys
exposed on partially degraded ﬁbrin, which ultimately leads to a
diminished efﬁciency and localization of plasminogen activation
by tPA.5 PAI-1 belongs to the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily and is the primary inhibitor of tPA. The active form of PAI-1 can

irreversibly neutralize the activity of its target serine protease by
forming a 1:1 stoichiometric covalent complex, accompanied by
deformation of the catalytic triad of the serine protease.6
Accordingly, elevated plasma levels of TAFI, PAI-1, or both
inhibitors instigate an increased risk for thrombotic disorders (eg,
venous thromboembolism,7 acute ischemic stroke,8 and acute myocardial infarction9,10) and cause thrombolytic failure.11,12 A considerable
number of studies using animal thrombosis models have demonstrated
a beneﬁcial effect of TAFI and PAI-1 as drug targets,13 but no study has
yet shown thrombolytic superiority over plasminogen activators.14,15
We postulate that single targeting of the antiﬁbrinolytic system does
not sufﬁce for robust thrombolysis. Because TAFI and PAI-1 act in a
complementary way at the ﬁbrin surface,16 we hypothesized that dual
TAFI/PAI-1 targeting would allow efﬁcient thrombolysis at safer
systemic drug levels.
Highly speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies (MA) against TAFI
and PAI-1 are available and have been previously validated in
vivo.17-19 MA-TCK26D6 modulates TAFI/TAFIa by impairing
activation mediated by thrombin and plasmin; however, it does not
block the stronger activator, thrombin/thrombomodulin.17 Interestingly this antibody also prevents the speciﬁc interaction of
TAFIa on ﬁbrin, but not on the other small proinﬂammatory substrates

of TAFIa.20 MA-33H1F7 converts the active form of PAI-1 to a
substrate for tPA, leading to the irreversible cleavage of PAI-1.21
TAFI and PAI-1 both act in the vicinity of a ﬁbrin clot, making simultaneous targeting of the 2 antigens through 1 protein a feasible and
potentially safer strategy. Previously, a corresponding small recombinantly engineered bispeciﬁc antibody, a diabody, was developed
to target TAFI and PAI-1 simultaneously and was designated as DbTCK26D6x33H1F7.22 In a thromboelastometric assay, we conﬁrmed
that simultaneous inhibition of TAFI and PAI-1 causes an enhancement of in vitro ﬁbrinolysis in human and mouse blood.22
In the present study, Db-TCK26D6x33H1F7 was used to evaluate
the concept of dual TAFI/PAI-1 inhibition in models of thromboembolism and stroke. The thromboprophylactic capacity of the diabody was evaluated in a well-established mouse model of venous
thromboembolism.17,18,23,24 In addition, the effect of the diabody
on brain ischemia/reperfusion injury was assessed in a mechanical
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo) model in which
brain lesion and neurologic/motor outcome were measured. Furthermore, the proﬁbrinolytic capacity was evaluated in 2 stroke models in
which in situ clots are induced in the vascular lumen of the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) via a thrombin- and a ferric chloride (FeCl3)induced MCA occlusion (MCAo) model. The goal was to compare the
efﬁcacy of the diabody vs the standard thrombolytic treatment to tPA
after thrombus formation. Finally, safety regarding potential bleeding
risks was evaluated.

Methods
A detailed description of the methods is provided in the supplemental Methods,
available on the Blood Web site.
Animals
Thromboplastin-induced thromboembolism, pharmacokinetics, and tail bleeding assay were performed on female SWISS mice (18-22 g; Janvier Labs, Saint
Berthevin, France). Mechanical tMCAo was performed on C57BL/6J mice
(females, 16-20 g; males, 20-24 g; The Jackson Laboratory). Thrombotic MCAo
was performed on male SWISS mice (30-35 g; Janvier Labs). Experiments were
performed in accordance with local ethical laws and local ethics committees (see
supplemental Methods for details) and the Council of the European Communities
Directive of November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC) guidelines for the care and use of
laboratory animals. All experiments were performed following Animal Research:
Reporting of in vivo Experiments guidelines (www.nc3rs.org.uk), including
randomization of treatment, as well as surgery and analysis blind to the treatment.
Venous thromboembolism model
Thromboplastin-induced thromboembolism was performed as described previously,17 with slight modiﬁcations. Endotoxemia was induced in overnightfasted nonanesthetized mice by intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide
(0.5mg/kg) from Escherichia coli serotype 026:B6 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO) 3 hours prior to the start of the experiment. Then, diabody (0.2 mg/kg or
0.8 mg/kg) or vehicle (isotonic saline) was administered via tail vein IV injection
in endotoxemic mice. Five minutes posttreatment, thromboembolism was
induced by IV injection of thromboplastin (corresponding to a dose of 2.5mg/kg
tissue factor). Fibrin deposition in lungs was quantiﬁed 15 minutes after thromboplastin injection as described previously17 (supplemental Methods).
Mechanical tMCAo
Surgical procedures and treatments. Mechanical tMCAo was performed as
described previously, according to the monoﬁlament method.25 The intraluminal
suture was left in situ for 60 minutes. The animals were then reanesthetized, and
the occluding monoﬁlament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. Immediately

after reperfusion, diabody (0.8 mg/kg) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline)
was administered by IV injection.
Neurologic tests. At 24 hours postocclusion, mice were subjected to the
modiﬁed Bederson test26 and the grip test27 to assess global neurologic function
and motor function, respectively (supplemental Methods).
Lesion quantiﬁcation and cerebral ﬁbrin(ogen). At 24 hours
postocclusion, mice were euthanized to quantify lesion volumes through
staining with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Cerebral ﬁbrin(ogen)
was determined as described in “Protein extraction and western blot
analysis” in the supplemental Methods.
Thrombotic (thrombin-induced) MCAo
Surgical procedure and treatments. Deeply anesthetized mice by inhalation
of 5% isoﬂurane/oxygen mixture were placed on a stereotaxic device and were
maintained under anesthesia by inhalation of 2% isoﬂurane/oxygen mixture
during surgical procedures. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C with
a thermostat-controlled heating pad throughout the procedure. Right MCA was
exposed by craniectomy. In situ occlusion of the MCA was performed by
microinjection of murine a-thrombin (1 IU; Kordia Life Sciences, Leiden, The
Netherlands) into the MCA,28 and time of occlusion was determined by laser
Doppler ﬂowmetry. Diabody or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) was administered by IV injection via a tail vein catheter at early (20 minutes), intermediate (90 minutes), and late (240 minutes) time points postocclusion. Five
minutes after diabody or vehicle administration, tPA (10 mg/kg) or saline was
administered by IV injection (10% as bolus and 90% infused over 40 minutes).
MRI analysis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at
24 hours postocclusion on a PharmaScan 7 T/12 cm system using surface coils
(Bruker Biospin; Wissembourg, France). Brain lesion volume was determined
by T2-weighted MRI (multislice, multiecho) sequence: repetition time/echo time
of 2500 milliseconds/51 milliseconds29); the angiographic scoring of the MCA
(0 5 occlusion, 1 5 partial recanalization, and 2 5 complete recanalization) was
determined by magnetic resonance angiography (2-dimensional time-of-ﬂight
sequences30); and cerebral hemorrhages were detected by T2*-weighted MRI
(fast low-angle shot sequence: repetition time/echo time of 350 milliseconds/
6 milliseconds). Mice with a lesion volume ,3 mm3 were excluded (no mice
were excluded from thrombin-induced MCAo experiments).
Tail bleeding assay
Mouse tail vein bleeding times and hemoglobin loss were determined with a
tail-clipping assay, as described previously31 (supplemental Methods).
Statistical analysis
All quantitative data are presented as mean and standard error of mean
(SEM). Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism v.5 (GraphPad
Software) (supplemental Methods). P values ,.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Characterization of the profibrinolytic effect of diabody in
a model of venous thromboembolism

In a model of thromboplastin-induced thromboembolism, which is well
established for the evaluation of proﬁbrinolytic agents,17,18,23,32 the
diabody was tested to determine an effective dose. Because of the
extremely low baseline levels of PAI-1 in mice, endotoxemic mice were
used in this type of acute model to obtain a potential contributing effect
of PAI-1 inhibition. Previously it was reported that under the given
conditions, endotoxemic mice had an increased PAI-1 plasma level of
112 6 30 ng/mL.33 In the present study, the plasma level of TAFI
was also measured under endotoxemic conditions and was found to
be 6.5 6 0.4 mg/mL (n 5 3). An initial dose of 0.2 mg/kg was administered by IV injection to obtain a circulating concentration
of diabody, theoretically equimolar to TAFI [TAFI plasma level

At 0.2 mg/kg diabody, thromboplastin-induced ﬁbrin deposition in
lungs was reduced but not to a signiﬁcant degree. With a higher
dose of 0.8 mg/kg diabody, however, ﬁbrin deposition in the lungs
was maximally reduced (94% reduction; Figure 1; P , .01 vs
vehicle, n 5 10 mice/group). Five minutes after administration of
0.8 mg/kg diabody, the plasma level was 6.6 6 0.2 mg/mL diabody
(n 5 3, supplemental Figure 2), which is consistent with the rapid
initial clearance (t½a) of a diabody.34 Thus, administration of diabody at 0.8 mg/kg results in an approximately equimolar concentration to TAFI shortly after injection. The diabody was used at
a dose of 0.8 mg/kg in further experiments, except for the thrombolysis experiments on FeCl3-induced thrombi (supplemental
Figure 3), which are more resistant to ﬁbrinolysis.
Profibrinolytic effect of diabody on cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion injury

A mechanical tMCAo model was used to assess the effect of diabody on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury when administered at
1 hour postocclusion. This model typically yields large lesion
volumes in untreated mice that have measurable neurologic/motor
defects. Experiments on the pharmacokinetics of the diabody
showed that its circulating half-life (t½b) is 121 minutes (supplemental Figure 2), which allows its administration by a single bolus.
At 24 hours postocclusion, mice treated with diabody (0.8 mg/kg)
exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced lesion volumes (Figure 2A-B;
P , .01; n 5 10-12 mice per group) and concomitantly improved
neurologic scores (Figure 2C; P , .05; n 5 10-12 mice per group) and
motor scores (Figure 2D; P , .01; n 5 10-12 mice per group). In
addition, western blot analysis revealed that the diabody effectively
reduced massive ﬁbrin deposition induced by reperfusion injury by at
least twofold (Figure 2E-F; P , .05; n 5 4 mice per group).
Thrombolytic effect of the diabody on fibrin-rich clots in
a model of thrombin-induced stroke

A model of thromboembolic stroke by local thrombin injection was
used in which clots are rich in ﬁbrin and thus susceptible to be
thrombolysed by tPA when administered early after clot onset; that

is, at 20 minutes postocclusion. The efﬁcacy of the diabody was
compared to that of tPA, the current thrombolytic agent. To mimic the
clinical procedure of thrombolysis, the administration of tPA was
performed by an initial bolus of 10% volume, followed by 90%
infusion during 40 minutes because of the short half-life of circulating
tPA (;5 minutes35). At 24 hours postocclusion, complete recanalization of the arterial lumen occurred in all groups, including the vehicle
group (median angiographic score 5 2). Lesion volume was reduced
by early administration of tPA; however, this reduction was not statistically signiﬁcant (37 6 13 mm3 [vehicle] vs 26 6 12 mm3 [t-PA];
Figure 3A; P 5 .203; n 5 6-8 mice per group). In contrast, early
diabody administration (0.8 mg/kg), regardless of the coadministration
of tPA, substantially reduced lesison volume at 24 hours (15 6 4 mm3
[diabody] and 15 6 8 mm3 [diabody plus tPA]; P , .01 and P , .05
vs vehicle, respectively; n 5 6-8 mice per group; Figure 3A).
When delaying the treatments to a clinically more relevant time
point; for example, at 90 minutes postocclusion (intermediate time
point),36 complete recanalization was also observed at 24 hours
postocclusion in all treatment groups (median angiographic score 5 2).
Neither intermediately delayed administration of diabody nor infusion
of tPA had any beneﬁcial effect on the lesion volume (25 6 3 mm3
[vehicle] vs 24 6 3 mm3 [tPA] vs 21 6 4 mm3 [diabody]; Figure 3B;
n 5 9-10 mice per group). However, at the same treatment time
point, diabody administration prior to tPA infusion resulted in a signiﬁcantly reduced lesion volume (15 6 2 mm3 [diabody plus tPA];
P , .05 vs vehicle; n 5 10 mice per group; Figure 3B).
None of the treatments had an effect on lesion sizes in this model when
administered at 240 minutes postocclusion (late time point, Figure 3C).
Assessment of bleeding

Tail bleeding experiments were performed to compare the effects
of tPA administered by IV injection at 2 different doses: the dose
equivalent to that used in clinical practice for humans (1 mg/kg) and
the dose typically used in mice (10 mg/kg). Diabody was injected at
0.8 mg/kg and 3.6 mg/kg. IV administration of diabody up to 3.6 mg/kg
did not alter tail bleeding time or accumulative hemoglobin loss after
60-minute tail incubation, whereas both doses of tPA prolonged
bleeding time and increased hemoglobin loss (Figure 4; n 5 9-10 mice
per group). Coadministration of diabody (0.8 mg/kg) and tPA
(10 mg/kg), the treatment regimen tested in the thrombin-mediated
MCAo model, did not further increase the tail bleeding time or hemoglobin loss compared to tPA administration alone.
Alternatively, no cerebral hemorrhages were observed in either
mechanical or thrombotic MCAo stroke models after any treatment.

Discussion
A considerable amount of clinical data link elevated levels of antiﬁbrinolytic proteins to a potentiated risk for intravascular thrombosis,
recurrent thrombosis, and thrombolytic failure.7,8,10,11 Antiﬁbrinolytic
proteins, such as TAFI and PAI-1, have been extensively studied
as drug targets in thrombosis-related pathologies.13 Notwithstanding
promising results, not all studies proclaim that inhibition of 1
antiﬁbrinolytic constituent is sufﬁcient to overcome thrombosis.31,37,38
Because TAFI and PAI-1 have complementary roles that are
localized at the ﬁbrin surface, we hypothesized that simultaneous
targeting of the 2 antiﬁbrinolytics would amplify the proﬁbrinolytic
capacity in a ﬁbrin-localized manner. Fibrinolysis is driven by
enzymatic activation of plasminogen into active plasmin through

the exposure of C-terminal lysines subsequent to plasmin-mediated
cleavage of ﬁbrin.4 Because these C-terminal lysines serve as cofactors
for tPA-mediated activation of plasminogen, this results in a selfpropagating dissolution of ﬁbrin. Through the enzymatic removal of
C-terminal lysines from ﬁbrin, TAFIa thereby conﬁnes ﬁbrinolysis.
TAFIa, however, prevents ﬁbrinolysis from entering into the propagation phase only when above a certain threshold concentration,
which is proportionate to the level of plasmin activity (ie, a higher level
of plasmin generation requires a higher amount of generated TAFIa to
withhold ﬁbrinolysis). In terms of a proﬁbrinolytic strategy, a PAI-1
inhibitor leads to increased tPA activity, resulting in more plasmin
generation and therefore causing an elevated threshold concentration
of TAFIa. The latter in combination with a TAFI inhibitor results in
a strong proﬁbrinolytic effect; that is, ﬁbrinolysis occurs in the presence
of much lower concentrations of tPA.

To facilitate drug development, a 2-in-1 molecule was designed,
called a diabody, to target TAFI and PAI-1 simultaneously. An additional advantage of such a construct was previously exempliﬁed
in vitro with Db-T12D11x33H1F739 and Db-TCK26D6x33H1F7.22
Db-TCK26D6x33H1F7 was speciﬁcally generated for the species
cross-reactive properties of the parental antibodies: in addition to its
cross-reactivity toward human TAFI and human PAI-1 allowing its
potential clinical use, the diabody can also be evaluated in preclinical
studies (without the need of a surrogate diabody). In both in vitro
studies, the diabodies were more efﬁcient in increasing ﬁbrinolysis
than the combined use of the corresponding parental antibodies. The
increased in vitro potency is most likely the consequence of the
smaller (58 kDa) and more ﬂexible structure of a diabody, favoring
efﬁcient penetration and diffusion into the blood clot. The current
study describes the ﬁrst use of this proﬁbrinolytic strategy in vivo.

Db-TCK26D6x33H1F7 was ﬁrst applied thromboprophylactically in a
well-established mouse model of thromboplastin-induced thromboembolism in which a low dose of 0.8 mg/kg (resulting in an equimolar
plasma concentration of TAFI) was maximally effective in clearing
ﬁbrin from lungs (Figure 1).
A common phenomenon in stroke patients is secondary infarct
growth despite initial vessel recanalization. The precise mechanisms
of this so-called reperfusion injury are still not completely understood
but involve complex thromboinﬂammatory processes. Intravascular
ﬁbrin deposition—trapping erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets—has
shown to directly obstruct cerebral microvascular perfusion during
ischemia and reperfusion.40-43 To further assess the potential proﬁbrinolytic effect of the diabody in this setting, it was evaluated in
a mechanical tMCAo model of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.
The diabody prominently reduced ﬁbrin(ogen) deposition and lesion
volume, which was associated with improved neurologic and motor
outcome at 24 hours (Figure 2). In line with this observation, TAFI and
PAI-1 levels are increased in patients suffering from ischemic stroke,
often correlating with stroke severity, suggesting a negative impact of
these antiﬁbrinolytic molecules in stroke development.8,44-50 Interestingly, whereas the diabody ameliorated the outcome in this model,
tPA has a controversial effect, potentially through aggravating
neuronal damage after focal cerebral ischemia.51 As a control, an in
vitro neurotoxicity assay was performed with or without N-methylD-aspartate and demonstrated the absence of any neurotoxicity
associated with the diabody (supplemental Figure 4).
Because there is an unmet clinical need to optimize current thrombolytic treatment of acute ischemic stroke, we next focused on mouse
models of thrombotic MCAo. Current treatment of acute ischemic
stroke consists of a high dose of tPA, which is effective only within 4.5
hours after symptom onset; however, only 20% of the small number of

patients who arrive in time receive thrombolytic therapy.2,3 This
reluctance against thrombolysis stems from life-threatening side
effects (hemorrhagic transformation and possible neurotoxicity of tPA)
and a thrombus-resolving efﬁciency that is rather low.52,53 Unexpectedly, neuroprotective agents, which block molecular elaboration
of ischemic insult on brain cells, have shown no clinical beneﬁt in
patients despite their preclinical efﬁcacy.54 Because recanalization
of the occluded vessel is in essence associated with improved clinical
outcome,1 it makes sense to target proteins such as TAFI and PAI-1
that inhibit thrombolysis.11 Indeed, when the diabody (0.8 mg/kg) was
administered early after thrombin-mediated MCAo, a strong beneﬁcial
effect on lesion volume was observed (Figure 3A). This reduction of
lesion volume even exceeded the effect of a high systemic dose of
tPA (10 mg/kg). To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report
of a pharmacologic treatment of ﬁbrin-rich clots resulting in a more efﬁcient lysis than with systemic administration of plasminogen activators.
According to a meta-analysis of 3 stroke trials (Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninterventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke,
European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study, and National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt-PA stroke trial), the greatest
beneﬁt is observed when tPA treatment is initiated within 90 minutes
after stroke onset.36 At $90 minutes after stroke onset, tPA treatment
does not always result in a beneﬁcial outcome, presumably because of
the increased stability of the clot (ie, clot retraction) resulting in
thrombolytic resistance, the neurotoxic effect of tPA to the
progressively damaged brain, the increased risk for hemorrhagic
transformation, or a combination of these effects. Therefore, in the
current study, a 90-minute postocclusion time was tested in the
thrombin-mediated MCAo model (Figure 3B). In contrast to the earlier
treatment time point (ie, at 20 minutes postocclusion), neither tPA
treatment nor diabody treatment at 90 minutes postocclusion had

a beneﬁcial effect on the lesion volumes. Interestingly, the combined
treatment of the diabody and tPA resulted in a signiﬁcantly decreased
lesion volume, underscoring the potential clinical beneﬁt of adding
the diabody to current thrombolytic treatment. Furthermore, a later
treatment time point of 4 hours postocclusion was tested, a time point
at which tPA was previously established to have had a deleterious
effect (ie, increased lesion volume). In our study, however, we observed only a tendency toward increased lesion volumes after tPA
treatment, alone or with diabody (Figure 3C). Diabody treatment at
this time point did not have any effect, which is in line with the
spontaneous resolution of the thrombin-induced clot in this model.55
In correspondence to the in vitro neurotoxicity data (supplemental
Figure 4), the diabody also had no deleterious effect in vivo.
To address another clinically relevant issue in the thrombolytic
treatment of stroke, a FeCl3-induced MCAo model was used in which
platelet-rich clots are formed that are resistant to tPA. The presence of
resistant platelet-rich clots contributes to the failure of thrombolytic
therapy in the majority of patients.52,53 Thus, in this model, tPA does
not reduce the lesion volume nor does it improve recanalization, even

when administered early (ie, at 20 minutes postocclusion).29 In clinical
practice, cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) is often measured during and early
after tPA administration to evaluate the success of tPA-mediated
thrombolysis.56 For this reason, in this model, CBF of the MCA was
monitored by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry up to 1 hour after stroke onset
in this set of experiments. In addition, recanalization of the MCA
was determined by magnetic resonance angiography at 24 hours. As
expected, no increase in either CBF or recanalization rate was observed
with vehicle or exogenous tPA, whereas the diabody (at 1.6 mg/kg and
3.6 mg/kg) effectuated a slight but signiﬁcant increase of CBF at 1 hour,
which further led to an increased recanalization rate at 24 hours
(supplemental Figure 3). Although no difference was detected between
both doses of diabody in terms of CBF and recanalization rate, only the
higher dose was able to decrease lesion volumes.
Bleeding is a feared complication of thrombolysis, especially in the
cerebral circulation. In the thrombosis-induced stroke models, no
cerebral bleeding was observed by MRI. However, these models are not
suitable for excluding possible cerebral bleeding, because even after
tPA administration, no hemorrhagic transformations occurred. Cerebral
bleeding tendency is related to the lesion volume, which is relatively
small in these models. The monoﬁlament, however, blocks the whole
MCA-perfused territory, which typically yields large lesions and more
easily transforms into cerebral bleeding. In this model, tPA has been
previously demonstrated to increase the incidence of bleeding and
edema,57 whereas the diabody in this study did not.
To study the risk of systemic bleeding on traumatic injury, we
performed a tail bleeding assay in which tPA and diabody were compared (Figure 4). A similar prolongation of bleeding time on administration of tPA was observed as in a previous study.58 The diabody,
however, caused no bleeding time prolongation nor increased accumulative hemoglobin loss. These results are in agreement with
a previous study in which TAFI/PAI-1 double-deﬁcient mice showed
no prolonged bleeding.31 With TAFI and PAI-1 inhibition, the
endogenous tPA activity is increased but most likely does not exceed
the systemic antiﬁbrinolytic capacity of a2-antiplasmin. In case of
potential side effects, the relatively short half-life of the diabody is
also advantageous; however, it is still long enough to allow a bolus
administration to obtain sufﬁciently high levels for several hours.
In conclusion, we have created a strong ﬁbrinolytic enhancer,
designated as Db-TCK26D6x33H1F7, with a robust in vivo performance in a variety of thrombotic and stroke mouse models. Our results
show that the diabody has potential clinical applications in the treatment
of thrombotic disorders as (1) prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism,
(2) treatment of brain ischemia/reperfusion injury, and (3) thrombolytic
treatment of both ﬁbrin-rich and platelet-rich clots in ischemic stroke.
This novel proﬁbrinolytic approach appears to be potentially safer and
more effective in mouse stroke models than the current treatment with
tPA. On the basis of these results, this diabody holds promise as a
candidate for clinical studies of thrombotic disorders.
