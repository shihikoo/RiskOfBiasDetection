Abstract The present study was conducted to investigate
the protective effect of phytoceramide against focal transient ischemic brain damage and the underlying mechanisms. Focal transient ischemic brain damage was
produced in rats by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
for 2 h followed by 24 h of reperfusion (MCAO/reperfusion). Orally administered phytoceramide (10, 25, and
50 mg/kg) significantly reduced MCAO/reperfusion-induced brain infarction and edema as well as the development of behavioral disabilities in the animals. Depletion of
glutathione levels and lipid peroxidation in brain tissue
following MCAO/reperfusion was reduced by administration of phytoceramide. The expressions of phosphorylated
extracellular signaling-regulating kinases/mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-ERK1/2 MAPK), inflammatory
factors such as cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide
synthase, and pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase-3
were increased while the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was
decreased in ischemic brain; these effects were

Furthermore, phytoceramide activated the phosphatidylinositol 30 -kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway to prevent ischemic
brain damage. These results suggest that phytoceramide
may help prevent neurodegeneration caused by ischemic
stroke due to its anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory properties.

Introduction
The brain has an abundance of glutamate, an excitatory
neurotransmitter. Consequently, this organ is particularly
vulnerable to ischemic insult caused by stroke (Choi 1992;
Hantzschel and Andreas 2000). Ischemic insult of the brain
leads to excessive accumulation of extracellular glutamate
due to the absence of energy-dependent reuptake mechanisms resulting in overactivation of cation-related glutamate receptors (Hantzschel and Andreas 2000; Fujimoto
et al. 2004). Excessively increased intracellular calcium
levels activate various enzymes such as proteases, lipases,
nitric oxide synthase (NOS), caspases, and endonucleases
(Chinopoulos and Adam-Vizi 2006). Mitochondrial dysfunction related to the initiation of apoptotic pathways and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation can also occur
(Kruman et al. 1998). These events promote delayed-type
neuronal death (apoptosis) as well as acute neuronal death
(necrosis) (Loh et al. 2006).
Ischemic insults activate mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPKs) including c-Jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK), extracellular signaling-regulating kinases (ERK),

123

2242

and p38, which subsequently activate inflammatory cascades (Kyriakis and Avruch 2001; Sarker et al. 2003).
Therefore, activation of MAPKs pathways and resultant
inflammatory processes, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and inducible NOS (iNOS) expression, are associated
with post-ischemic apoptotic damage in the brain (Aloisi
2001). On the other hand, the pro-survival phosphatidylinositol 30 -kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway has been
shown to be involved in the inactivation of pro-apoptotic
mediators including caspase-3 and Bax in the brain
(Cantley 2002; Hasegawa et al. 2006).
In most cases, the distinction between necrosis and
apoptosis is a main concern when treating ischemic stroke.
Although early restoration of blood flow by clot lysis and
reperfusion reduce irreversible necrotic brain damage in
the ischemic core, delayed neuronal suicide in the
penumbra presents another dilemma. Apoptosis and
inflammation are mainly associated with this type of
ischemic core expansion (Nakase et al. 2004; Kaushal and
Schlichter 2008). Therefore, prevention of apoptotic neuronal death in the penumbra is a main goal of stroke
therapy.
Sphingolipids such as ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate are present in the plasma membrane in
mammals. These factors act as key regulators of apoptosis,
survival, and regeneration in the nervous system (Posse de
Chaves 2006). Ceramide produced from dihydroceramide by
desaturase is the basic structural component of complex
sphingolipids. Phytoceramide, an intermediate metabolite
produced during the conversion of dihydroceramide to ceramide, is predominantly found in plants and yeast (Gault
et al. 2010). It is known to help regulate cell growth and
stress responses in yeast (Skrzypek et al. 1999; Mao et al.
2000). Additionally, synthetic phytoceramide exerts cytotoxic and immunostimulatory effects on various cell types
that represent novel therapeutic intervention strategies for
treating cancer and other diseases (Lee et al. 2001; Sekiya
et al. 2011). A recent study found that there is a significant
amount of phytoceramide in mouse tissues, brain, heart, and
liver, mouse primary cultures of astrocytes, and human
oligodendroglioma cells, indicating that this factor influences central nervous system development and the progression of neurodegenerative diseases (Dasgupta et al.
2013). Another previous study indicated that phytoceramide
possesses neuroprotective activity against glutamate-induced
toxicity in cultured neurocortical cells and improves spatial
memory in mice, suggesting that this compound could be a
useful therapeutic agent for treating neurodegenerative
conditions (Jung et al. 2011). In the present study, we
investigated the neuroprotective effect of phytoceramide,
which consists of a phytosphingosine backbone acylated
with oleic acid (Fig. 1), on focal transient ischemic brain
damage in rats induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion

evaluated.

Materials and methods
Chemicals and preparation of reagent
Phytoceramide (white powder, [95 % purity) was provided
by Doosan Glonet (Suwon, South Korea). 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and cresyl violet were purchased
from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against Bcl-2, Bax, active caspase-3,
procaspase-3, iNOS, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2),
PI3K, and b-actin along with goat polyclonal antibodies
against COX-2 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit secondary antibody were purchased from Millipore,
Inc. (Bedford, MA, USA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies
against Akt and p-Akt were acquired from Cell Signaling,
Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody was purchased from
Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI, USA).
Experimental animals
Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (Sam: TacN(SD)fBR) were
obtained from Samtako, Inc. (Gyunggi-Do, South Korea).
The rats were housed in an environmentally controlled room
at 22 ± 2 C with a relative humidity of 55 ± 5 %, 12-h
light/dark cycle, and food and water provided ad libitum.
Procedures involving the experimental animals complied
with the regulations for the care and use of laboratory animals of the animal ethics committee of Chungbuk National
University (CBNUA-267-10-02) and the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals (NIH publication no. 8023, revised 1978).
MCAO/reperfusion-induced focal cerebral ischemia
in rats and evaluation of ischemic brain damage
Before surgery, male SD rats weighing 280–300 g were
fasted overnight with free access to water. Focal cerebral
ischemia was produced by MCAO for 2 h followed by

reperfusion for 24 h as previously described (Ban et al.
2008). Following neurological score evaluation and motor
coordination testing after MCAO/reperfusion, the rats were
sacrificed by decapitation under anesthesia (diethyl ether)
and the brains were quickly removed. The infarction and
edema volumes for the brain tissue were measured using
TTC staining (Ban et al. 2008). Histological examination of
the brain tissue was performed using cresyl violet staining as
previously described (Tureyen et al. 2004). Neurological
status of animals was evaluated according to the Menzies
method (Menzies et al. 1992). A rotarod test was used to
evaluate motor coordination. Speed of the rotarod (775 Rota
rod, IITC Life Science Inc., Woodland Hills, CA,, USA)
was slowly increased from 4 to 40 rpm within 5 min. The
animals that were able to remain on the revolving rod for a
period of 5 min before the surgical procedures were selected
for analysis. The time they remained on the accelerating
rotarod was then measured after MCAO/reperfusion. Data
are presented as the longest time on the rotarod out of three
trials (Takahashi et al. 2008). Phytoceramide (10, 25, and
50 mg/kg) dissolved in corn oil (Sigma Chemical Co.) with
a brief ultra-sonication (W-380, Heat systems, Inc., Farmingdale, NY, USA) was orally administered three times:
0.5 h before and 1 h after occlusion, and 1 h after reperfusion. Corn oil was used as vehicle.

were separated in 12.5 % SDS-PAGE gels and transferred
to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Perkin
Elmer Co., Waltham, MA, USA). The membranes were
incubated with primary antibodies against Bcl-2, Bax,
active caspase-3, procaspase-3, COX-2, iNOS, p-ERK1/2,
PI3K, p-Akt, Akt (1:1000), and b-acitn (1:2000) followed
by horseradish-peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit or antigoat secondary antibodies (1:3000). Antibody binding was
detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Images were quantified using ImageJ software (a freely
available application in the public domain for image
analysis and process, developed and maintained by Wayne
Rasband at the Research Services Branch, NIH, Bethesda,
MD, USA; http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the
mean (SEM). Differences were assessed with a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test or
Mann-Whitney U test. p values \0.05 were considered
significant.

Results
Biochemical analysis
Ipsilateral cerebral tissues were removed after 24 h of
reperfusion and stored at -80 C. Homogenates were
freshly prepared with a fourfold volume of 100 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in an ice bath. Reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were estimated spectrophotometrically (Sunrise, Tecan Austria GmbH, Grodig, Austria)
previously described (Ellman et al. 1961). Values are
expressed as nmol per mg protein. The extent of lipid
peroxidation was assayed by measuring the levels of
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) at 532 nm
(Sunrise, Tecan Austria GmbH, Grodig, Austria) as previously described using 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane
(Sigma Chemical Co.) as a standard (Yoshioka et al. 1979).
TBARS values are expressed as nmol per mg protein per
hour. Protein concentration was determined according to
the Lowry method (Lowry et al. 1951).
Western blotting
After 24 h of reperfusion, infarcted and surrounding areas
of brain cortical tissue were isolated and homogenized with
ProPrep buffer (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, South
Korea), and the total proteins were extracted. The amount
of protein was measured using the Bradford method
(Bradford 1976). Approximately 40 lg of total protein

Inhibitory effect of phytoceramide on MCAO/
reperfusion-induced histopathological damage
in rats
Infarction and edema are the two main pathophysiological
changes observed in cases of cerebral ischemia (Tominaga
and Ohnishi 1989). Cellular swelling causes brain edema,
which is the earliest response to ischemic injury. Representative brain slices from sham-, vehicle-, and phytoceramide-treated groups are shown in Fig. 2a. TTC-stained
coronal sections in which normal brain tissue was stained
deep red by a reaction of TTC with mitochondrial dehydrogenase were used to determine the volume of cerebral
infarction; infarcted tissue was not stained. After MCAO/
reperfusion, significant cerebral infarction was observed in
the ipsilateral rat brain. Orally administered phytoceramide
(10, 25, and 50 mg/kg) reduced cerebral infarction and
edema caused by MCAO/reperfusion (Fig. 2b). Rat body
temperature was monitored for 6 h after cerebral reperfusion commenced, and no significant differences were
observed between the phytoceramide and control groups
(data not shown). Thus, the observed neuroprotective effect
of phytoceramide could not be attributed to hypothermia.
Histological changes in the ischemic regions of the
injured brain with the following characteristics were
observed with cresyl violet staining: condensed nuclei, loss

Neurological deficits, such as circling movement and
decreased grip of the contralateral forelimb, were observed
in rats with MCAO/reperfusion. The neurological deficit

compared to that of the vehicle-treated control group
(Table 1). Rotarod duration of the vehicle group was
reduced to 35.6 ± 12.1 s compared to 194.1 ± 12.0 s for
the sham group. Decreased rotarod duration was

and lipid peroxidation
Levels of GSH and TBARS, a marker of lipid peroxidation,
were measured after MCAO/reperfusion in the ipsilateral
brain. GSH contents significantly decreased in vehicletreated animals compared to those of the sham animals.
Phytoceramide (25 and 50 mg/kg) inhibited the reduction
of GSH levels (Table 2). MCAO/reperfusion increased
TBARS concentrations in the vehicle animals compared to
those of the sham animals. Phytoceramide (50 mg/kg)
significantly attenuated the increase of TBARS levels
(Table 2). No significant changes in GSH and TBARS
concentrations of the contralateral brain were observed in
all groups (data not shown).

with MCAO/reperfusion compared to those of the shamoperated group. However, the expression level of Bcl-2
was markedly upregulated in animals treated with phytoceramide (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg; Fig. 4b). MCAO/reperfusion caused markedly increased levels of pro-apoptotic
proteins Bax and active caspase-3. Phytoceramide (10, 25,
and 50 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the MCAO/reperfusion-induced increase of pro-apoptotic protein expression
(Fig. 4b, c). The expression levels of PI3K and p-Akt
significantly decreased in the vehicle group compared to
those in the sham-operated group. In contrast, PI3K and
p-Akt expression levels were upregulated in animals treated with phytoceramide (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg) compared
to those in the vehicle group (Fig. 4d, e).
Inhibitory effect of phytoceramide on MCAO/
reperfusion-induced expression of p-ERK1/2, iNOS,
and COX-2 in brain tissues
Higher expression of p-ERK1/2 was observed in brains
damaged by MCAO/reperfusion compared to sham-operated brains. Administration of phytoceramide (10, 25 and
50 mg/kg) decreased the expression of p-ERK1/2 in the
ischemic brain. Additionally, the expression of iNOS and
COX-2 in the ischemic brain was also increased after

MCAO/reperfusion; this effect was significantly inhibited
by treatment with phytoceramide (Fig. 5).

Discussion
Ischemic brain damage induced by a reduction of blood
flow due to a clot or thrombi is initiated in the ischemic
core. The ischemic core expands into the penumbra, the
surrounding area of the core, over time. Necrotic cell death
in the ischemic core is non-salvageable, but secondary cell
death in penumbra can be ameliorated (Jovin et al. 2003;
Ferrer 2006). Transient MCAO/reperfusion using intraluminal sutures, which is a generally acceptable animal
model because of the similarity to human stroke clinically
and biochemically, induces primary damage in the striatum
(Hoffman et al. 2006). Secondary damage expands into the
cortical region, causing infarction and edema. In the current study, phytoceramide reduced MCAO/reperfusion-induced brain infarction and edema, particularly in the lateral
cortical region. Phytoceramide might help prevent the
expansion of infarction into the salvageable cortical region.
Motor disturbances including hemiparesis are well known
consequences of lesions in the frontal cortex and striatum
of the rat, and neurological deficit severity has been

Excessive production of ROS and impairment of the
ROS removal system are associated with behavioral, neurochemical, and histological abnormalities induced by
MCAO/reperfusion (Yousuf et al. 2009; Khan et al. 2010).
Although the brain is vulnerable to this oxidative insult, an
abundance of antioxidants including GSH and superoxide
dismutase are thought to have a neuroprotective effect
against ischemic brain damage (Amantea et al. 2009).
Depletion of GSH represents the absence of an intrinsic
redox system followed by increased free radical loads,
triggering peroxidation of lipids and proteins as well as
DNA damage that causes neuronal apoptosis (Amantea
et al. 2009; Khan et al. 2010). MCAO/reperfusion increases
lipid peroxidation in the brain because of the high lipid
content (Muralikrishna Adibhatla and Hatcher 2006). ROS
produce malondialdehyde, an end product of lipid peroxidation, that reacts with TBA and is estimated as TBARS
levels (Ponist et al. 2010). In the present study, GSH levels
significantly decreased while TBARS contents significantly
increased in MCAO/reperfusion rats. Phytoceramide conferred significant protection against MCAO/reperfusion-

2247

induced collapse of anti-oxidative mechanisms associated
with these factors.
Mitochondria are the major intrinsic source of ROS as
well as the main target of oxidative stress. ROS derived
from mitochondria play a pivotal role in promoting neuronal apoptosis in the penumbra (Annunziato et al. 2003;
Galindo et al. 2003). Mitochondrial membrane damage is
related to expression of Bcl-2 family members including
Bcl-2, Bax, and Bad that regulate apoptosis. Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein, prevents apoptotic cell death by preserving mitochondrial membrane permeability to cytochrome c (Graham and Chen 2001). Pro-apoptotic proteins
including Bax and Bad are inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane and trigger the release of cytochrome
c (Elyaman et al. 2002; Galindo et al. 2003). Cytochrome c
released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into
the cytosol consequently mediates activation of caspase-3,
the executor of apoptosis. Activated caspase-3 cleaves
numerous proteins, thus initiating biochemical cascades
that lead to cell death (Ferrer et al. 2003a). Results from the
present study showed that MCAO/reperfusion decreased
Bcl-2 levels while leading to the overexpression of Bax and
active caspase-3 in brain tissue. These apoptotic changes
were significantly suppressed by administration of phytoceramide. Necrotic cell death in the ischemic core occurs
within minutes to a few hours whereas cells in the
penumbra die more slowly, mainly by apoptosis (Ferrer
et al. 2003b). Therefore, anti-apoptotic properties of phytoceramide could contribute to the prevention of ischemic
stroke.
Involvement of the cell survival pathway in the neuroprotective effect of phytoceramide was also investigated in
the current study. The PI3K/Akt pathway regulates cell
growth, proliferation, and survival under physiologic and
pathologic conditions (Shioda et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2009).
It is well known that many neuroprotectants including glialderived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), and erythropoietin exert their protective effects via the PI3K/Akt pathway (Jin et al. 2002;
Kaya et al. 2005; Kilic et al. 2005). PI3K activation initiated
by phosphorylation of the receptor tyrosine kinase leads to
the generation of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate followed by Akt
phosphorylation (Burgering and Coffer 1995). p-Akt is
involved in the inactivation of pro-apoptotic mediators
including Bad, caspase-9, and glycogen synthase kinase-3b,
and consequently rescues neurons from apoptosis (Cantley
2002; Hasegawa et al. 2006). Phytoceramide prevented the
decrease of PI3K and p-Akt expression in ischemic brain
tissue in the present study. Therefore, activation of the PI3K/
Akt pathway by phytoceramide might partly contribute to
the protection of neurons from apoptosis.

It has been discovered that MAPKs play important roles
in inflammation and apoptosis during MCAO/reperfusion
(Kim et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2013). In cases of brain
ischemic injury, p-ERK1/2 MAPK translocate into the
nucleus from the cytoplasm, resulting in the stimulation of
numerous downstream signaling events associated with
inflammation and apoptosis (Alessandrini et al. 1999;
Namura et al. 2001). In many cells including neurons, proinflammatory processes such as COX-2 and iNOS expression are linked to ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Park et al.
2001; Huang et al. 2014). Therefore, inhibition of p-ERK1/
2, COX-2, and iNOS expression could reduce ischemic
brain injury (Zhang et al. 2013). Phytoceramide significantly inhibited the increase of p-ERK1/2 expression in
brains with MCAO/reperfusion in the present study. The
expression of inflammatory enzymes COX-2 and iNOS
was also inhibited by phytoceramide. These results suggest
that phytoceramide improves the outcomes of ischemic
brain injury by preventing inflammation-mediated cell
death. It was thus concluded that phytoceramide inhibited
apoptotic neuronal death in brains with MCAO/reperfusion-induced ischemia via anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities.
Excitotoxicity through overactivation of N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA) receptors by the extensive release of
glutamate is known as an important cause of tissue damage
in cases of focal cerebral ischemia (Lipton 1999). In our
previous investigations, we also showed that MCAO/
reperfusion-induced infarct and edema were blocked by the
NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (Kim et al. 2011,
2012). Phytoceramide was found to inhibit glutamate-induced cell death in cultured cortical neurons (Jung et al.
2011). Therefore, it was hypothesized that anti-oxidative
and anti-inflammatory activities of phytoceramide
observed in the present study may result from the ability of
this compound to reduce glutamate neurotoxicity in the
ischemic brain. Further studies are needed to clarify the
precise underlying mechanism.
Ceramide is a key sphingolipid messenger that regulates
a diverse range of cell-stress responses. During the aging
process and neurodegenerative disease development, ceramide levels in the brain are progressively increased and
mediate apoptotic neuronal death (Cutler et al. 2004). On
the other hand, there is also evidence that ceramide can
confer cytoprotection. Cell-permeable C2-ceramide has
been found to protect hippocampal neurons against injury
induced by glutamate (Goodman and Mattson 1996),
apoptosis caused by nerve growth factor withdrawal (Ito
and Horigome 1995), and apoptosis initiated by immature
rat brain hypoxia-ischemia (Chen et al. 2001). Although
ceramide has received extensive attention from the scientific community, the biological effects of phytoceramide in
cases of neurodegenerative diseases have gained very little

interest. Thus, the present investigation represents the first
research into the neuroprotective effect of phytoceramide
against focal transient ischemic brain damage.
In summary, the current study provided strong evidence
that phytoceramide exerts neuroprotective effects against
cerebral ischemia-reperfusion damage, which is strongly
associated with scavenging free radicals as well as inhibition of neuronal apoptosis and neuroinflammation. It was
therefore postulated that phytoceramide could be a new
promising agent for preventing neurodegeneration induced
by ischemic stroke.
