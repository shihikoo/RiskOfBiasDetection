Ferulic acid, a phenolic phytochemical compound found in various plants, has a neuroprotective effect
through its anti-oxidant and anti-inﬂammation functions. Peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin play a
potent neuroprotective function against oxidative stress. We investigated whether ferulic acid regulates
peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin levels in cerebral ischemia. Sprague-Dawley rats (male, 210–230 g)
were treated with vehicle or ferulic acid (100 mg/kg) after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and
cerebral cortex tissues were collected 24 h after MCAO. Decreases in peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin levels were elucidated in MCAO-operated animals using a proteomics approach. We found that ferulic acid
treatment prevented the MCAO-induced decrease in the expression of peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin.
RT-PCR and Western blot analyses conﬁrmed that ferulic acid treatment attenuated the MCAO-induced
decrease in peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin levels. Moreover, immunoprecipitation analysis showed
that the interaction between thioredoxin and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) decreased
during MCAO, whereas ferulic acid prevented the MCAO-induced decrease in this interaction. Our ﬁndings suggest that ferulic acid plays a neuroprotective role by attenuating injury-induced decreases in
peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin levels in neuronal cell injury.

Ferulic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy cinnamic acid, is a phenolic
phytochemical constituent of many grains, fruits, and vegetables.
Ferulic acid exhibits an anti-oxidant effect through scavenging
reactive oxygen species, and also inhibits inﬂammation [1,3].
Ferulic acid, because of its anti-oxidative and anti-inﬂammatory
activities, has been shown to have therapeutic effects in various
diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases
[9,19,24]. Moreover, ferulic acid decreases infarct volume and
apoptotic cell death in focal cerebral ischemic injury [4].
Peroxiredoxins and thioredoxin are ubiquitously expressed
antioxidant proteins. These proteins prevent oxidative stress and

regulate biological process such as cell proliferation and apoptosis [8]. Peroxiredoxins comprise a family of six anti-oxidative
enzymes. Among these enzymes, peroxiredoxin-2 is a neuronspeciﬁc protein that is abundantly expressed in the brain [7,23].
Peroxiredoxin-2 has cytoprotective effects against oxidative stress
in neuronal cell culture and has been shown to reduce brain injury
after transient brain ischemia [2,5]. Moreover, over-expression
of peroxiredoxin-2 improves neurological recovery after brain
ischemic insults [5]. These studies demonstrate the fact that
peroxiredoxin-2 plays an important role in response to oxidative
stress in neurons [14]. A previous study demonstrated that overconsumption of peroxiredoxin-2 under oxidative stress reduces
thioredoxin activation, leads to the activation of apoptosis signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) [21]. The production of reactive oxygen
species due to the oxidation of thioredoxin leads to apoptosis by

activation of ASK1. Activated ASK1 phosphorylates and activates
JNK, which ultimately induces the apoptotic cascade. Thus, it
is accepted that thioredoxin binds to ASK1, thereby inhibiting
stress-induced apoptosis [13,21]. Moreover, thioredoxin has neuroprotective functions against oxidative stress in brain ischemic
injury and also exerts cytoprotective effects through mediation
of neuronal cell differentiation and regeneration [18]. Thioredoxin reduces infarct volume and neuronal apoptosis after brain
ischemic damage by attenuating oxidative stress and preventing caspase-3 expression [17,26]. Overexpression of thioredoxin
in transgenic mice and administration of thioredoxin have been
shown to decrease brain damage following transient focal cerebral ischemia [6,25]. In this proteomic study, we investigated that
peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin expression decreases in a focal
cerebral ischemia animal model. Furthermore, we studied whether
ferulic acid attenuates the decrease in peroxiredoxin and thioredoxin following brain ischemic injury.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (210–230 g, n = 60) were used (Samtako Co., Animal Breeding Center, Osan, Korea). All animal
experiments followed a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Gyeongsang National
University. Animals were maintained under controlled temperature and lighting (12 h/12 h light/dark cycle) and were randomly
divided four groups, vehicle + sham group, ferulic acid + sham

group, vehicle + middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group,
and ferulic acid + MCAO group. Ferulic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA) was dissolved in normal saline for the vehicle. A single dose
of ferulic acid (100 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected intravenously
immediately after MCAO [6].
The MCAO operation was induced as previously referenced [16].
Animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg).
Brieﬂy, the right common carotid artery was exposed and the external carotid artery was cut. A 4/0 nylon monoﬁlament with its tip
rounded by heat was inserted into the external carotid artery and
advanced through the internal carotid artery until it reached the
origin of the middle cerebral artery. The sham-operated animals
underwent the same surgical process, except for arterial blockade.
The body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 ◦ C throughout
the surgical procedure with a temperature-controlled heating pad
and overhead lamp. The brain tissues were collected at 24 h after
the onset of MCAO.
A proteomic analysis was performed as previously described
[10,12]. For the proteomic analysis, the right cerebral cortices were
homogenized in lysis buffer (8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, ampholytes, and
40 mM Tris–HCl) and were centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 20 min
at 4 ◦ C. The supernatant was removed and the pellets were dissolved in lysis buffer. Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA) was used to determine total protein concentration. For the

two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, the immobilized pH
gradients (IPG, pH 4–7, pH 6–9, 17 cm, Bio-Rad) gel strips were
incubated in rehydration buffer (8 M urea, 2% CHAPS, 20 mM DTT,
0.5% IPG buffer, bromophenol blue) that contained sample proteins for 13 h. The protein samples were focused on Protean IEF Cell
(Bio-Rad) at 20 ◦ C in three steps: 250 V (15 min), 10,000 V (3 h), and
then 10,000 V to 50,000 V. After IEF focusing, 2D gel electrophoresis was performed using gradient gels (7.5–17.5%) with Protein-II
XI electrophoresis equipment (Bio-Rad) at 10 ◦ C. Current conditions were 5 mA per gel for 2 h and followed by 10 mA per gel for
10 h. The following steps were performed for gel staining. The gels
were ﬁxed in solution of 12% acetic acid and 50% methanol for 2 h
and subsequently washed with 50% ethanol for 20 min. The gels
were washed with deionized water and stained with a silver solution (0.2% silver nitrate, 0.75 mL/L formaldehyde) for 20 min, and

washed with deionized water. The gel was developed in a solution
of 0.2% sodium carbonate, 0.5 mL/L formaldehyde and the reaction
was stopped using 1% acetic acid. The gel images were scanned with
Agfar ARCUS 1200TM (Agfar-Gevaert, Mortsel, BEL). The PDQuest
2-D analysis software (Bio-Rad) was used for the analysis of the
protein spots. The gel pieces containing the desired protein spots
were manually cut out from the gels and processed for MALDI-TOF.
The gel particles were digested in trypsin-containing buffer, and the
extracted. Peptides were analyzed in a Voyager-DETM STR biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystem, Forster city, CA, USA) for
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Proteins were identiﬁed using the
search programs MS-Fit and ProFound program, and SWISS-PROT
and NCBI were used to identify protein sequence.
The total RNA of the right cerebral cortices was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)

J.-H. Sung et al. / Neuroscience Letters 566 (2014) 88–92

following the manufacturer’s instruction. Total RNA (1 ␮g)
from each sample was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA with superscript III ﬁrst-strand system using RT-PCR
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) based on the manufacturer’s
protocol. The following primers were used: peroxiredoxin2 (244 bp), forward primer: 5 -AGGACTTCCGAAAGCTAGGC-3 ,
reverse primer: 5 -TTGACTGTGATCTGGCGAAG 3 ; thioredoxin
(188 bp), forward primer: 5 -TTCTTTCATTCCCTCTGTG-3 , reverse
primer: 5 -TCCGTAATAGTGGCTTCG-3 ; actin (238 bp), forward
primer: 5 -GGGTCAGAAGGACTCCTACG-3 , reverse primer: 5 GGTCTCAAACATGATCTGGG-3 . The PCR reaction was carried out
as follows: 5 min at 94 ◦ C, 30 s at 94 ◦ C, 30 s at 54 ◦ C, 1 min at 72 ◦ C,
and 10 min at 72 ◦ C. The samples were ampliﬁed for 30 cycles. PCR
products were run on a 1% agarose gel was visualized under UV
light. The intensity of each band was quantiﬁed using SigmaGel 1.0
(Jandel Scientiﬁc, San Rafael, CA, USA).
Western blot analysis was performed as previously described
[10,12]. Total protein (30 ␮g) was prepared and separated on to
10% SDS–polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and
membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1%
Tween-20 (TBST), and incubated with the following antibodies:
anti-peroxiredoxin-2, anti-thioredoxin (diluted 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) and anti-actin (diluted 1:1000,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) as primary antibody. The membrane was incubated with secondary antibody
(1:5000; Pierce). The ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used for detection
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
All data are expressed as mean ± S.E.M. The results in each group
were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by Student’s t test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.
Using a proteomics approach, we identiﬁed a decrease in expression of peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin in the cerebral cortices of
vehicle + MCAO animals (Fig. 1A–D). Peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin expression was signiﬁcantly decreased in vehicle + MCAO
animals, whereas the decrease in these proteins expression was
attenuated in ferulic acid + MCAO animals. Moreover, RT-PCR and
Western blot analyses clearly showed changes in peroxiredoxin-2
and thioredoxin levels between vehicle- and ferulic acid-treated
animals during MCAO. Peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin levels
were decreased in vehicle + MCAO animals compared to shamoperated controls, whereas ferulic acid administration attenuated
the ischemic injury-induced decrease in the levels of these proteins. RT-PCR analysis revealed that peroxiredoxin-2 transcript
levels were 0.59 ± 0.01 and 0.82 ± 0.03 in vehicle + MCAO and ferulic acid + MCAO animals, respectively (Fig. 2A and B). Thioredoxin
transcripts levels were 0.33 ± 0.02 and 0.83 ± 0.03 in vehicle- and
ferulic acid-treated animals during MCAO (Fig. 2C and D). Moreover,
peroxiredoxin-2 proteins levels were 0.68 ± 0.01 and 0.89 ± 0.02
in vehicle + MCAO and ferulic acid + MCAO animals, respectively
(Fig. 2E and F). Thioredoxin proteins levels were 0.70 ± 0.02
and 0.81 ± 0.01 in vehicle + MCAO and ferulic acid + MCAO animals, respectively (Fig. 2G and H). The binding of thioredoxin
to ASK1 was decreased in vehicle + MCAO animals, whereas the
binding of these two proteins was similar in ferulic acid + MCAO
animals and sham-operated animals. The thioredoxin and ASK1
interaction levels were 0.62 ± 0.03 and 0.88 ± 0.02 in the vehicle + MCAO and ferulic acid + MCAO animals, respectively (Fig. 3A
and B).
We reported previously that ferulic acid reduces infarct volume
and decreases apoptotic cell death in response to focal cerebral
ischemia [10–12]. Ferulic acid also exhibits neuroprotective effects
due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inﬂammatory capacities during
brain ischemic injury [4]. In this study, we demonstrated that ferulic

acid attenuated the MCAO-induced reduction in peroxiredoxin-2
and thioredoxin expression in an animal model.
Cerebral ischemia induces overproduction of reactive oxygen
species, which leads to neuronal cell damage due to activation
of various apoptotic signaling pathways [22]. Peroxiredoxin-2 is
a potent anti-oxidant protein that prevents neuronal cell death in
response to oxidative stress. The overexpression of peroxiredoxin2 reduces the number of apoptotic cells and decreases brain
injury in transient brain ischemia. Conversely, a deﬁciency in
peroxiredoxin-2 elevates susceptibility to neuronal cell injury
by oxidative stress. Moreover, peroxiredoxin-2 also has cytoprotective effects in response to oxygen glucose deprivation [5].
Peroxiredoxin-2 is principally found in neurons of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus. However, peroxiredoxin-2
immunoreactivity is not expressed in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, and microglia except in the basal ganglia
[23]. These results demonstrate that peroxiredoxin-2 exerts a
protective effect against ischemic injury in neurons. Moreover,
peroxiredoxin-2 exerts a pro-survival effect in ischemic neuronal
injury by modulating thioredoxin, thereby preventing the oxidative
stress-induced activation of ASK1 [5]. Similar to peroxiredoxin2, thioredoxin is an antioxidant enzyme that exhibits protective
effects against reactive oxygen species. Thioredoxin prevents neuronal insult during brain ischemia by reducing infarct volume
and neuronal cell death [17]. In addition, thioredoxin increases
cleaved caspase-3 expression and apoptotic cell death in transient brain ischemia [26]. Thioredoxin exerts its cytoprotective
effects through mediating the expression of nerve growth factor,
providing an anti-apoptotic signal and reducing oxidative stress
[18]. Thioredoxin protein is abundantly presented in nervous tissue and localized in the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane of
neurons [15,20]. We found that the expression of peroxiredoxin2 and thioredoxin are decreased in brain injury-induced MCAO

using a proteomics approach. Furthermore, ferulic acid treatment
attenuated the reduction in peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin levels
caused by brain ischemic injury. We conﬁrmed these results using
RT-PCR and Western bolt analyses. These results can be explained
by the mechanism of action of peroxiredoxin-2. Peroxiredoxin-2,
which is oxidized by free radical scavengers, reduces thioredoxin,
and this reduced thioredoxin binds to ASK1 and inhibits the activity
of ASK1 [5]. In contrast, thioredoxin oxidation leads to the activation of the apoptotic cascade and results in apoptotic cell death.
Thus, the interaction between thioredoxin and ASK1 exerts protective effect against ischemic injury. We demonstrated that MCAO
injury decreases the binding of thioredoxin to ASK1. However, the
binding of these two proteins was similar in MCAO-injury animals
with ferulic acid-treated and sham-operated animals. These ﬁndings indicate that ferulic acid prevents the ischemic injury-induced
decrease in the interaction between thioredoxin and ASK1. In conclusion, ferulic acid attenuates brain ischemic injury by regulating
the expression of peroxiredoxin-2 and thioredoxin and maintaining the interaction between thioredoxin and ASK1, thus preventing
apoptotic cell death.
