Abstract
Introduction: Despite attempts to prevent brain injury during the hyperacute phase of stroke, most sufferers end
up with significant neuronal loss and functional deficits. The use of cell-based therapies to recover the injured brain
offers new hope. In the current study, we employed human neural stem cells (hNSCs) isolated from subventricular
zone (SVZ), and directed their differentiation into GABAergic neurons followed by transplantation to ischemic brain.
Methods: Pre-differentiated GABAergic neurons, undifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs or media alone were stereotaxically
transplanted into the rat brain (n=7/group) 7 days after endothelin-1 induced stroke. Neurological outcome was
assessed by neurological deficit scores and the cylinder test. Transplanted cell survival, cellular phenotype and
maturation were assessed using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy.
Results: Behavioral assessments revealed accelerated improvements in motor function 7 days post-transplant in
rats treated with pre-differentiated GABAergic cells in comparison to media alone and undifferentiated hNSC
treated groups. Histopathology 28 days-post transplant indicated that pre-differentiated cells maintained their
GABAergic neuronal phenotype, showed evidence of synaptogenesis and up-regulated expression of both GABA
and calcium signaling proteins associated with neurotransmission. Rats treated with pre-differentiated cells also
showed increased neurogenic activity within the SVZ at 28 days, suggesting an additional trophic role of these
GABAergic cells. In contrast, undifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs predominantly differentiated into GFAP-positive astrocytes
and appeared to be incorporated into the glial scar.
Conclusion: Our study is the first to show enhanced exogenous repopulation of a neuronal phenotype after stroke
using techniques aimed at GABAergic cell induction prior to delivery that resulted in accelerated and improved
functional recovery.

Introduction
Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disorder that remains
a major cause of death and disability in the industrialized world [1]. Aside from thrombolysis, which is limited
by a narrow therapeutic window, there is no effective
therapeutic treatment proven to promote neurological
recovery in the postischemic phase [2].
Regenerative events initiated following brain damage
are active for weeks following stroke [3, 4], which potentially provides a second window for treatment. Although
there are promising treatment strategies that target brain
regeneration, including repetitive training, exercise, and
physical therapy [5–7], many stroke survivors are often
not able to participate in rehabilitation programs until
many weeks after a stroke event and delayed rehabilitation results in worse outcomes [8].
Exogenous cell-based therapies to complement endogenous repair mechanisms are currently being trialed in
humans following extensive meta-analysis of over 40 studies reporting significant improvements in function after
cell transplantation in ischemic animal models [9–11].
Despite early reports of functional benefits in humans [12,
13], a cellular basis for neurological improvement still remains elusive [14]. Whilst neural cell replacement may be
achieved, new research shows that neural stem cells
(NSCs) can exert trophic effects through secretion of
protein factors which induce change in the host tissue
to promote functional improvements [15]. In addition
to identifying how these cells work, it is equally important to isolate factors that influence stem cell survival and long-term integration within host tissue.
To date, all preclinical and clinical stem cell transplant
studies for the treatment of stroke have been conducted
using undifferentiated stem cells [10, 16, 17]. Survival of
these cells ranges between 0.5 and 30 % [17–23], and although they are capable of forming neuronal populations
after transplant in animal models, cells most predominantly differentiate into astrocytes [16, 17, 20]. Functional
recovery in these studies has therefore been suggested to
be due to trophic support [19, 24], but this effect has
not been well characterized or documented.
Recent reports in other models of neurological disease
suggest that predifferentiating stem cells into a neuronal
phenotype prior to transplant might be a better approach [25–28]. Indeed, differentiated human neural
progenitor cell-derived GABAergic neurons injected into
the spinal cord following spinal cord injury result in
long-term survival of GABAergic cells that generate glutamic acid decarboxylase, gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA), and β-III tubulin, resulting in functional improvement [26]. We therefore see value in using a similar approach for promoting recovery after stroke. To this
end, we have employed human neural stem cells
(hNSCs) isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ)

Page 2 of 19

[29] and directed their differentiation into GABAergic
neuronal cells. In the present study we investigated the
effect of transplanting undifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs versus predifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs into the rat brain 7
days after stroke. We determined the optimal phenotypic
conditions that translate into best outcomes in terms of
cell survival, histopathology, and functional recovery.

Materials and methods
The following experiments were conducted in adherence
with current RIGOR guidelines [30, 31] and included
randomization of treatments, blinding during assessment, inclusion of appropriate control groups, and full
statistical analysis involving power calculations in consultation with the Statistical Consulting Centre, University of
Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.
Ethics statement and animals

All experiments were performed in strict accordance
with the guidelines of the National Health & Medical
Research Council of Australia Code of Practice for the
Care and Use of Animals for Experimental Purposes in
Australia. The protocol was approved by the St Vincent’s
Hospital animal ethics committee (AEC009/09). Surgeries
were performed under general anesthesia and paracetamol
(2 mg/kg in drinking water) was provided 24 hours
prior to and after surgery to minimize distress. A
total of 30 adult male Hooded Wistar rats weighing
300–360 g (Laboratory Animal Services, University of
Adelaide, Australia) were used for experiments. Rats
were group housed (four rats/cage) prior to stroke,
whereupon they were individually housed on a 12hour light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food
and water.
Surgical preparation

Rats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (75 mg/kg:10 mg/kg respectively intraperitoneally)
and maintained throughout surgery by inhalation isoflurane (95 % O2 and 5 % isoflurane). A 23-gauge stainless
steel guide cannula was stereotaxically implanted into
the cortex 2 mm dorsal to the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) (0.2 mm anterior, –5.9 mm lateral, –5.2 mm
ventral) as in previous studies [32, 33]. Rats were
allowed to recover for 5 days prior to stroke induction.
Endothelin-1-induced stroke

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in conscious rats
(n = 30) by constriction of the right MCA with perivascular administration of endothelin-1 (ET-1, 60 ρmol in 3
μl saline over 10 minutes; American Peptide Company,
Inc., CA, USA) [32, 33]. Characteristic behavioral
changes indicative of stroke were scored 1–5 for stroke
severity according to our previously established protocol,

Abeysinghe et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2015)6:8

with 5 being the most severe [33]. Rats that did not display behavioral changes were considered not to have suffered a stroke and were excluded from further study.
Only rats with an initial stroke severity score of 4, and
with clear deficits of ≥3 according to the neurological
deficit score at 7 days, were used for stem cell transplants so as to minimize sample variation associated
with different stroke outcomes [32, 33].
In vitro cell preparation
hNSC expansion, medium preparation and handling

Experiments were conducted using hNSCs isolated from
the SVZ of human fetal brain tissues (14–21 weeks) that
were obtained following donor consent under the strict
guidelines approved by the Singapore National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review Board (reference:
D/06/154) [29]. The hNSCs were cultured as free-floating
neurospheres using protocols described previously.
Prior to transplant, cryopreserved SVZ-hNSCs were
thawed, passaged 48 hours later, and expanded as described previously [29]. Briefly, cells were collected and
mechanically dissociated by trituration, and approximately
0.7 × 106 cells/well were plated into low-adherence sixwell plates (Corning Costar, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA). For expansion, cultures were maintained in
complete media (Neurocult NS-A hNSC proliferation
media and supplement; Stem Cell Technologies Inc., Tullamarine, VIC, Australia), human epidermal growth factor
(EGF, 20 ng/ml; Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), human
basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 20 ng/ml; Peprotech), heparin (2 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA), and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5 % CO2 atmosphere) for a minimum
of 14 days to reach appropriate numbers required for differentiation and transplantation. A 50 % media change
was performed every second day. Cell density and viability
(≥90 %) was determined using the standard 0.1 % trypan
blue exclusion test [29].
In vitro differentiation of hNSCs

For differentiation of SVZ-hNSCs, neurospheres were
first dissociated into single-cell suspensions with TryplE,
and then cultured in differentiation media consisting of
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)/F12 (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and neurobasal media
(1:1) supplemented with 1 % StemPro neural (Invitrogen),
0.5 % N2 (Gibco), and 50 ng/ml brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; Peprotech) to induce differentiation as described previously [29]. All cultures were
maintained at 37 °C in a humidified culture incubator
(5 % CO2 atmosphere) for 7 days, with a 50 % differentiation
media change every second day.

In vitro immunocytochemistry

To determine the phenotype of undifferentiated (day 0)
cells, SVZ-hNSC neurospheres were seeded onto poly-Llysine-coated (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and
laminin-coated (Sigma) eight-well chamber slides (Nunc
Lab-Tek, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a density of approximately 200,000 cells/ml. After seeding, for day 0
analysis, neurospheres were allowed to attach for 2
hours at 37 °C under 5 % CO2 before removal of media
and fixation with 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 minutes for immunocytochemical analysis. For analysis of differentiated
SVZ-hNSCs (day 7), hNSCs were seeded onto poly-L-lysine-coated (Sigma) and laminin-coated (Sigma) eightwell chamber slides as already described. SVZ-hNSCs were
placed in differentiation media as described earlier and
after 7 days the cells were fixed with 4 % PFA for 10 minutes at room temperature, washed (1 × 5 minutes in
0.1 M PBS), and processed for immunocytochemistry.
Immunofluorescence was performed on in vitro cell culture chamber slides to analyze phenotypic profiles as described previously [26]. Briefly, cells were blocked with
5 % normal goat serum (NGS) (or 1 % bovine serum albumin [BSA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA] for all
staining with goat anti-parvalbumin (PV) antibody) in
0.1 % Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS for 20 minutes before
SVZ-hNSCs were identified using primary antibodies
including mouse anti-human specific nuclear antigen
(HuNu, 1:1000; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), rabbit
anti-neuronal class III β-tubulin (Tuj1, 1:1000; Covance Inc., Sydney, NSW, Australia), rabbit anti-GABA
(1:1000; Sigma), rabbit anti-Nestin (1:1000; Millipore),
rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1000;
DAKO, Glostrup, Hovedstaden, Denmark), guinea-pig
anti-doublecortin (DCX, 1:500; Millipore), rabbit antineuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN, 1:1000; Millipore), rabbit
anti-Ki67 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific), rabbit antiSOX2 (1:400; Millipore), rabbit anti-glutamate decarboxylase 65&67 (GAD, 1:1000; Millipore), rabbit antisynaptophysin (SYN, 1:200; Sigma), chicken Tuj1 (1:200;
Millipore), mouse anti-calbindin-D28k (CB, 1:1000; Swant,
Marly, Fribourg, Switzerland), goat anti-PV (1:1000;
Swant), and rabbit anti-calretinin (CR, 1:1000; Swant). All
primary antibodies were diluted in 5 % NGS in 0.1 M PBS
and cells were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature
followed by washing in 0.1 M PBS.
Secondary fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (1:500
for all) included Alexa-568 goat anti-mouse, Alexa-488
goat anti-mouse, Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit, Alexa-488
goat anti-rabbit, Alexa-488 goat anti-guinea pig, Alexa555 goat anti-chicken, Alexa-647 goat anti-chicken, and
Alexa-568 donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen). Antibodies
were diluted in 5 % NGS in 0.1 M PBS and cells were incubated for 1 hour followed by washing in 0.1 M PBS.

Abeysinghe et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2015)6:8

In all experiments, DNA counterstain 4′,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI; Molecular Probes, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) was applied before coverslipping with ProLong gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen). Control experiments included either omission of each primary
antibody from the protocol or the inclusion of the appropriate IgG control to verify the specificity of each
antibody. Resulting sections were examined with a
Nikon confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY, USA).
Stereology for cultured cells was assessed by manually
quantifying immunolabeled cells at a magnification of ×
60 using the confocal microscope. Cells in two wells
were analyzed for each immunocytochemical stain. Cell
counts were performed at six randomly selected sites
within each culture well. The total number of cells immunoreactive for Tuj1, GABA, Nestin, GFAP, SOX2,
and Ki67 was determined and expressed as a percentage
of the total number of HuNu-positive cells.
Preparation of cells for transplantation

SVZ-hNSCs were prepared for transplantation by treating neurospheres with 0.01 % DNase/DMEM for 20 minutes at 37 °C followed by rinsing in 0.01 % DNase/
DMEM and centrifugation at 190 × g for 5 minutes, resuspension in 0.01 % DNase/DMEM, and gentle trituration into a single-cell suspension.
SVZ-hNSCs were predifferentiated in preparation for
transplantation by culturing neurospheres in the presence
of BDNF and neural supplements as described earlier.
After 7 days, differentiated SVZ-hNSCs were collected
and centrifuged at 190 × g for 5 minutes, and a single-cell
suspension was made prior to transplantation.
Undifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs or predifferentiated cell
suspensions comprised a final cell concentration of
400,000 cells/μl and ≥90 % viability for transplantation.
Experimental design
Surgical transplantation

Seven days after ET-1-induced stroke, rats were reanesthetized as already described. A total of 800,000
cells in 2 μl were delivered to each graft site via a
Hamilton syringe attached to a glass capillary (open
diameter 50–70 μm). The glass capillary was left in place
for a further 5 minutes after each dose before retrieval.
A total of eight graft sites relative to the bregma were
chosen across the striatum and cortex as follows: Site 1,
1.4 mm anterior, –4.9 mm lateral, –3 and –5 mm ventral; Site 2, 1.4 mm anterior, –2.8 mm lateral, –3.6 and –
5.6 mm ventral; Site 3, 0.2 mm anterior, –3.8 mm lateral,
–4.8 and –5.8 mm ventral; and Site 4, –2.16 mm anterior, –6 mm lateral, –3.3 and –4.3 mm ventral. All rats
were immunosuppressed by daily intraperitoneal injections of cyclosporine (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally daily;

Page 4 of 19

Sandimmune, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover,
NJ, USA) commencing 2 days prior to cell transplantation.
Functional assessments

Neurological assessments were conducted on all rats
prior to any surgical procedures (pre surgery), immediately prior to ET-1-induced stroke (0 hours post stroke),
24 and 48 hours post stroke, 7 days after stroke (day 0
post transplant), and again 7 and 28 days post transplant. Forelimb asymmetry was analyzed using a cylinder
test and the percentage of forelimb placements made on
the wall of the plexiglass cylinder during rearing was determined using the methods of Schallert et al. [34]. Animals were also tested for neurological abnormalities and
assigned deficit scores based on abnormal posture and
hemiplegia as described previously [32, 33, 35, 36]. All
scores from each rat post stroke were compared with
prestroke scores, and thus each rat acted as its own
control.
Tissue processing and analysis

Rats were re-anesthetized 28 days post transplant and
transcardially perfused with 300 ml ice-cold PBS (0.1 M,
pH 7.4) followed by 300 ml cold 4 % PFA (in PBS, 0.1
M, pH 7.4) for 15 minutes. Forebrains were removed
and post-fixed overnight in 4 % PFA in 0.1 M PBS at 4 °C
followed by cryoprotection overnight in 0.1 M PBS with
30 % sucrose at 4 °C. Brains were then frozen and coronal
sections (40 μm) prepared using a cryostat and processed
as free-floating tissue sections.
In vivo immunohistochemistry

Immunofluorescence staining was performed on tissue
sections to analyze and quantify graft survival, maturation, and differentiation as described previously [26].
Briefly, free-floating tissue sections were blocked using
standard immunohistochemical techniques with 5 %
NGS (or 1 % BSA [Sigma] for all staining with goat antiPV antibody) in 0.3 % Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PBS before
SVZ-hNSCs were identified using primary antibodies including mouse anti-HuNu (1:1000; Millipore), rabbit
anti-Tuj1 (1:1000; Covance Inc.), rabbit anti-GABA
(1:1000; Sigma), rabbit anti-Nestin (1:1000; Millipore),
rabbit anti-GFAP (1:1000; DAKO), rabbit anti-NeuN
(1:1000; Millipore), rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:500; Thermo
Fisher Scientific), rabbit anti-SOX2 (1:400; Millipore),
rabbit anti-GAD (1:1000; Millipore), rabbit anti-SYN
(1:200; Sigma), chicken anti-Tuj1 (1:200; Millipore),
mouse anti-CB (1:1000; Swant), goat anti-PV (1:1000;
Swant), rabbit anti-CR (1:1000; Swant), rabbit anticleaved caspase-3 (Casp3, 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA), and rabbit anti-von Willebrand
Factor (vWF, 1:200; Millipore).

Abeysinghe et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2015)6:8

Secondary fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (1:500
for all) included Alexa-568 goat anti-mouse, Alexa-488
goat anti-mouse, Alexa-350 goat anti-mouse, Alexa-488
goat anti-rabbit, Alexa-647 goat anti-rabbit, Alexa-555
goat anti-chicken, Alexa-647 goat anti-chicken, and
Alexa-568 donkey anti-goat (Invitrogen). Antibodies
were diluted in blocking solution.
For all experiments, DNA counterstain DAPI (Molecular
Probes, Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was applied before coverslipping with ProLong gold anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen).
Control studies included either omission of each primary
antibody from the protocol or the inclusion of the appropriate IgG control to verify the specificity of each antibody.
Staining for terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick endlabeling (TUNEL) was performed using a TUNEL staining
kit (Promega DeadEnd Colorimetric TUNEL system; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Stained sections were examined with
a Nikon confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA). Orthogonal projections
were performed using National Institute of Health ImageJ
software (NIH).
Quantification and stereology
Infarct assessment

Eight predetermined coronal planes throughout the brain
from 3.2 to –6.8 mm relative to the bregma [33] were collected for NeuN staining. Triplicate sections from each level
were visualized with an Olympus (Albertslund, Denmark)
microscope and stroke-damaged regions were identified as
areas with distinct absence of NeuN stain, which was analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA)
[37–39]. The infarct volume was determined by integrating the cross-sectional area of damage at each
stereotaxic level and the distance between the levels
[40], with edema corrected for as described previously
[33, 41].
Stereological analysis

The optical fractionator stereological method was
used to obtain unbiased estimates of the total number
of HuNu-positive nuclei within undifferentiated and
predifferentiated cell graft sites (n = 7/group) using Stereo
Investigator software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT,
USA) [20, 25, 42]. Briefly, every third section was analyzed
using a fluorescence microscope (BH-2; Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan) equipped with a QIClick scientific camera
(QImaging, Surrey, BC, Canada) at a magnification of ×
60, where a three-dimensional optical dissector counting
probe (x, y, z dimensions of 30 μm × 30 μm × 10 μm respectively) was applied to a systematic random sample of
sites within the cell graft [25]. Only HuNu-positive cells
with clearly visible fluorescence were quantified.

Page 5 of 19

Cell phenotyping

The number of HuNu-positive cells that expressed Tuj1,
GABA, Nestin, GFAP, and Ki67 was manually counted
for phenotypic analysis of cells in vivo within transplant
sites. Cells were considered colocalized if labeling of
markers was seen throughout the extent of the HuNupositive nucleus or if a cytoskeletal/cytoplasmic marker
surrounded the HuNu-positive nuclear marker. Quantitative analysis was performed in three tissue sections
280 μm apart per graft site (four graft sites/rat) using
z-scan confocal microscopy at × 40 magnification for
animals that received undifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs or
predifferentiated cells (n = 7/group) as described previously [43–47]. Briefly, estimates of the total number of
cells colocalizing with markers of interest were obtained using the following formula:
X
E¼k
N
where E is the estimate of the total number of stained
cells in each case, ∑N is the sum of n values in the three
sections analyzed, and k indicates that every kth section
was considered (k = 8). N was corrected according to
Abercrombie’s formula:
N ¼ nt=ðt þ DÞ
where n is the number of cells counted in each section, t is
the section thickness, and D is the mean diameter of the
cells [48]. Colocalized cell counts were expressed as the percentage of the total number of HuNu-positive cells.
Because of the positioning of hNSC grafts, very few
sections collected contained the exact same anatomical
region within the SVZ for accurate comparisons of host
neurogenesis across all rats. For this reason, only a qualitative assessment of the influence of exogenous transplants on host neurogenesis was made.
Statistical analysis

Data obtained in the cylinder test were analyzed by twoway repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test to compare differences between treatment groups over time. Data obtained for infarct area and volume assessments were
analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni post-hoc test. Neurological deficit scores were
analyzed by Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric ANOVA
followed by Dunn’s post test. We performed a post-hoc
power calculation to arrive at 73 % where P <0.01, in
which deficits were considered improved by a score
of 1 with a standard deviation of 0.87. All cell counts
were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by the
Bonferroni post-hoc test to compare treatment groups
and graft sites. Data were analyzed with GraphPad
Prism, version 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego,

Abeysinghe et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2015)6:8

CA, USA) and presented as mean ± standard error of
the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was defined
as P <0.05.

Results
In vitro characterization of cells

Confocal analysis of immunolabeled undifferentiated
SVZ-hNSCs in vitro revealed formation of neurospheres
that were colocalized with HuNu and the undifferentiated cell marker SOX2 (98.9 ± 0.7 %) (Fig. 1a). These
cells also colocalized with proliferation marker Ki67
(59.5 ± 3.1 %) and NSC marker Nestin (95.1 ± 0.7 %)
(Fig. 1b), but did not express early neuronal marker
Tuj1, inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, GABAproducing enzyme GAD, or immature neuronal marker
DCX (Fig. 1c–f ). In contrast, predifferentiated SVZhNSCs labeled with HuNu were positive for Tuj1
(92.3 ± 1.4 %) (Fig. 1g), GABA (90.1 ± 2.7 %) (Fig. 1h),
GAD (Fig. 1i), and DCX (Fig. 1j). Very few predifferentiated cells expressed Ki67 (9.6 ± 2.5 %) (Fig. 1k) or
Nestin (28.5 ± 2.6 %, Fig. 1l) and SOX2 (12.1 ± 1.7 %,
Fig. 1m). No expression of GFAP, SYN, or the intracellular calcium binding proteins (CBPs) CB, CR, or
PV was detected in vitro.
Transplant studies
Treatment groups

A total of 21 rats were included in this study. Seven rats
were excluded prior to stem cell transplant based on low
stroke severity scores and minimal functional deficits detected at 7 days [32, 33]. Only rats with a stroke rating
of 4 and a clear functional deficit of ≥3 were randomly
assigned to three experimental groups (n = 7/group):
Group 1 received media without any cells (vehicle
control); Group 2 received undifferentiated SVZhNSC transplants; and Group 3 received predifferentiated cells.
Functional outcomes

Cylinder test No significant bias in forelimb use upon
rearing was detected using the cylinder test prior to
stroke induction in any treatment group. After stroke,
all rats exhibited asymmetrical limb use indicative of
stroke damage with preferential ipsilateral (unimpaired)
forelimb use during rearing (Fig. 2a). While transplantation
of either undifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs and predifferentiated
SVZ-hNSCs appeared to decrease forelimb asymmetry
after treatment, this effect was only statistically significant
in rats receiving predifferentiated hNSCs at 7 and 28 days
post transplant in comparison with vehicle control rats receiving media alone (Fig. 2a) (P <0.05, two-way ANOVA).
Neurological deficit score No neurological deficits
were observed prior to ET-1-induced stroke. However,

Page 6 of 19

significant deficits were observed in all treatment groups
between 24 hours and 7 days after stroke (day 0 post
transplant) (P <0.001, nonparametric ANOVA) (Fig. 2b).
By 28 days, rats receiving vehicle control or undifferentiated hNSCs showed significant recovery in their deficits
when compared with pretransplant scores (P <0.01).
Rats that received predifferentiated hNSCs demonstrated
earlier recovery with significant improvements observed
7 days post transplant (P <0.001) when compared with
pretransplant scores, with no significant deficits detected
28 days post transplant when compared with prestroke
scores (P >0.05).
Infarct assessment

Absence of NeuN immunoreactivity revealed strokeinduced damage to the parietal, insular, and frontal cortex, as well as the striatum as reported previously [33].
Both infarct area (Fig. 2c, d) and infarct volume (Fig. 2e)
within the cortex and striatum were consistent across
treatment groups with no significant differences detected
between groups (P >0.05, two-way ANOVA).
Characterization of cells within grafts

Cell counts HuNu immunostaining revealed large numbers of SVZ-hNSCs within each graft site situated both
within and outside the damaged regions 28 days post
transplant. Although rats receiving undifferentiated hNSCs
displayed evidence of cells within each transplant site,
many HuNu-positive NSCs were also detected beyond the
transplant regions and were also visible within the infarct
border zone. Rats that received predifferentiated SVZhNSCs showed dense clustering of cells within each site.
Stereological cell counting revealed significantly fewer undifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs within the cortex and striatum
(64,712 ± 16,866 cells and 260,278 ± 14,112 cells respectively) compared with predifferentiated HuNu-positive cells
in cortical and striatal graft regions (444,852 ± 22,181 and
508,098 ± 10,031 cells respectively) (P <0.0001; Fig. 3a).
A greater number of predifferentiated (P <0.05) and
undifferentiated (P <0.0001) SVZ-hNSCs remained
within striatal grafts compared with cortical graft
sites (Fig. 3a). However the overall percentage of
transplanted predifferentiated cells remaining within
cortical and striatal graft sites (27.8 ± 1.3 % and 31.8
± 0.5 % respectively) was significantly higher than

eight predetermined coronal planes through the brain (two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post test)

expressed markers for GFAP and Nestin (Fig. 4a, b),
with many cells also positive for Ki67 (Fig. 4c). Some undifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs were also found to express
GABA and Tuj1 (Fig. 4d, e). In contrast, predifferentiated cells mainly expressed Tuj1 and GABA (Fig. 4f, g)
with little colabeling with Nestin and Ki67 (Fig. 4h, i)
and a distinct lack of GFAP expression (Fig. 4j).
Immunofluorescent NeuN staining was used to confirm positioning of graft sites within the infarcted region
for stereological analysis across all groups receiving
SVZ-hNSC transplants (Fig. 5a–h). Cell counts within
each site revealed that there were significantly less cells
that expressed Tuj1 (6.6 ± 1.3 %; P <0.0001) and GABA
(5.4 ± 1.4 %; P <0.0001) for undifferentiated SVZ-hNSC
grafts compared with predifferentiated cell grafts (Tuj1:

89.6 ± 1.9 %; GABA: 94.3 ± 1.6 %) across all transplant
sites (Fig. 5i–l, ANOVA). Conversely, there was a
significantly greater proportion of undifferentiated SVZhNSCs that expressed markers for GFAP (93.0 ± 1.9 %;
P <0.0001), Nestin (88.1 ± 2.8 %; P <0.0001), and Ki67
(11.9 ± 1.6 %; P <0.05) compared with transplanted predifferentiated cells (GFAP: 4.7 ± 1.3 %; Nestin: 11.6 ± 3.3

Further confocal analysis revealed that predifferentiated
SVZ-hNSC grafts expressed GAD65/67 (Fig. 6a), as well as
the intracellular CBPs CB (Fig. 6b), CR (Fig. 6c), and PV
(Fig. 6d). In addition, predifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs were
observed to express SYN that was mostly localized to the

(Fig. 6e), but was also additionally observed along the

Predifferentiated SVZ-hNSC grafts located within the periinfarct territory appeared to extend long neurites revealed

with limited dispersion of SVZ-hNSCs in closest proximity
to the scar (Fig. 7a–c). Parallel negative control experiments
omitting primary antibodies depict a low level of autofluorescence within the core infarct (Fig. d–f).
Effect of cell transplantation on the neurogenic niche
To investigate the effects of SVZ-hNSC transplant on
endogenous recovery mechanisms we examined changes
within the neurogenic niche in response to stem cell
transplant. Confocal analysis revealed an apparent

increase in the number of Ki67-positive proliferating
cells within the ipsilateral SVZ of rats that received predifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs in comparison with rats that
received undifferentiated SVZ-hNSCs or vehicle controls
(Fig. 8a–f ). In particular, immunofluorescent labeling of
cells within the SVZ revealed an apparent increase in
the number of newly generated DCX-positive neurons in
rats with predifferentiated SVZ-hNSC transplants in
comparison with the contralateral SVZ, and rats with
undifferentiated hNSC transplants or vehicle controls
(Fig. 8b, d, f ). Further analysis of immunolabeled cells
within the SVZ revealed an apparent increase in the
number of GFAP-positive radial glial cells with long processes directed towards the infarct that did not colocalize with Nestin in animals that received predifferentiated
SVZ-hNSC transplants compared with the contralateral
SVZ, and compared with the other treatment groups

Discussion
The use of undifferentiated stem cells for treatment of
neurological diseases including stroke have undergone
intense investigation in preclinical models [49–51].

Undifferentiated stem cells are thought to provide
trophic factor support to injured or “depressed” neural
circuitry and respond to host microenvironmental cues
by migrating and differentiating into various cell types to
influence functional recovery. An alternative approach
to cell-based therapies, however, includes predifferentiating hNSCs prior to transplant to improve functional outcomes in animal models of Huntington’s

disease, Parkinson’s disease, and neuropathic pain
models [25, 26, 28].
Here we report the first evidence in a model of stroke
for accelerated improvement in motor function following transplantation of predifferentiated human GABAergic hNSCs compared with undifferentiated hNSCs. We
demonstrate that GABAergic neuronal transplants survive within the stroke-affected rat brain, mature, and extend processes with evidence of synaptogenesis and
calcium signaling events associated with neurotransmission. Moreover, rats receiving predifferentiated cells
showed evidence of increased endogenous neurogenesis,
with immature neurons seen extending from the SVZ
towards the damaged striatum. In contrast, undifferentiated SVZ-hNSC transplants predominantly differentiated
into astrocytes and appeared to contribute to scar formation within the peri-infarct border zone. Our results
suggest that differentiation of hNSCs into a neuronal
phenotype prior to transplant may be a favorable strategy for in vivo cell restoration and improved motor
function after stroke.

In vitro cell phenotyping

In vitro differentiation of SVZ-hNSCs prior to transplantation at day 7 revealed a highly enriched population of GABAergic neurons that expressed Tuj1, GABA,
and GAD [29]. The expression of both GAD isoforms
(65 and 67) confirmed functional differentiation of these
cells with an ability for neurons to produce and release
GABA [52, 53] and excluded the possibility of GABA
immunoreactivity resulting from in vitro uptake [28].
The decreased expression of markers Nestin, Ki67, and
SOX2 with in vitro differentiation was consistent with
phenotypic GABAergic conversion. Predifferentiated
cell cultures comprised few Ki67-positive cells indicating the majority of cells had undergone differentiation. In
contrast, examination of undifferentiated hNSCs revealed a
larger population of Nestin, Ki67, and SOX2 immunopositive cells. Furthermore, previous in vitro analysis of predifferentiated hNSCs using our GABAergic predifferentiation
protocol has already shown that differentiation does not result in the expression of markers for oligodendrocytes, D2
dopamine receptors, or postsynaptic glutamate receptors.

It does, however, result in downregulation of precursor cell
associated markers and leads to the majority of hNSCs expressing GABAergic neuronal phenotypic markers [28].
Taken together, differentiation in vitro results in downregulation of stem cell markers and an upregulation of neuronal markers where the majority of predifferentiated
cells displayed a GABAergic neuronal phenotype [29].
Effect of cells on functional recovery

Treatment with differentiated GABAergic hNSCs accelerates functional recovery when compared with rats
treated with undifferentiated hNSCs. In particular,
neurological deficit scores were improved at earlier
times after stroke in comparison with undifferentiated
hNSC-treated rats. Recovery observed in GABAergic
cell-treated rats 28 days post transplant was consistent
with prestroke neurological scores. Unlike other treatments, GABAergic cell treatment resulted in statistically
improved forelimb asymmetry, comparable with prestroke asymmetry. These results show that differentiation into a GABAergic cell lineage prior to transplant
has beneficial effects on recovery for both the cortical
and subcortical motor systems.

Transplant survival and migration

Only rats with the same stroke severity scores were included in these experiments, which resulted in little
variation detected between infarct volumes across treatments. As such we were able to assess cell responses to
the host microenvironment without having to take into
account variations in brain injury between groups [32].
Despite the aforementioned findings, a comparison of
cell survival 28 days post transplant between treatment
groups was difficult due the apparent migration of undifferentiated cells away from the graft site. In our
study, only 16 % of undifferentiated hNSCs were detected within striatal grafts and only 4 % within cortical
grafts 28 days post transplant. Undifferentiated hNSCs
favor less hostile environments and have previously
been reported to migrate towards border regions [54,
55], which could account for the low cell numbers
detected in the original grafts. For this reason, the periinfarct territory is currently the target area for transplantation because it is thought to be less hostile and
may provide a more supportive extracellular matrix for
cell grafts to anchor [22, 37, 56]. In contrast, we now
show for the first time that a greater percentage of cells

Abeysinghe et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2015)6:8

can be retained in the target region if stem cells are predifferentiated. Approximately 30 % of GABAergic cell
transplants were still detected in cortical and striatal
graft sites even within the severely damaged brain 28
days post transplant. These cells were not in a state of
decay since they did not stain positive for apoptotic
markers Casp3 or TUNEL stain.
Previous reports suggest that between 0.5 and 15 % of
exogenously grafted cells survive in the core infarct and
only 20–30 % survive in locations distant to the infarct
[18–22]. We now show that cell retention following
transplant can be improved through predifferentiation,
albeit some cell loss is probably necessary since pruning
and refinement of cell numbers to facilitate development
of efficient networks is an important process during
development [57, 58]. Our findings may support the
delivery of fewer cells while still achieving therapeutic
outcomes.
The question remains: how do GABAergic cells survive within the severely damaged brain? The answer may
relate to trophic factor support provided from blood vessels detected within and surrounding grafts [59–61].
Angiogenesis occurs as early as 3 days after ET-1 stroke
[62] and is thought to provide a platform for brain repair. Cells grafted to sites of revascularization after
stroke might be expected to do better [62–64]. Current
clinical trials favor delaying cell-based treatments until
behavioral deficits reach a steady plateau and the microenvironment is less aggressive [11, 65]. Unfortunately,
delaying treatment also allows time for newly formed
vasculature to regress [66]. Our results suggest that cellbased therapies may benefit from a developed microvascular bed for optimizing survival and influence of exogenous grafts on functional recovery. Timing cell-based
therapy within weeks after stroke, when standard therapeutic procedures have been exhausted and relative
stabilization of the infarct has occurred, may be a more
suitable option for intervention.
Posttransplant histology

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed predominant
differentiation of hNSCs into GFAP-positive astrocytes
28 days post transplant in all brain regions targeted. Astrocytes are becoming recognized as a restorative therapeutic target for brain injury, including stroke, because
their phenotype can mediate aspects of brain integrity,
neuronal cell death, and repair [67]. Astrocyte activation
and reactive astrogliosis can result in both beneficial and
deleterious responses, and is dependent on the intensity
and hostility of the stroke-damaged environment [32, 67,
68]. In the ET-1 stroke model, reactive astrogliosis and
glial scarring is established by 14 days [62] and is a
major obstacle to brain repair and functional recovery
[69, 70]. For this reason we chose not to transplant cells

Page 15 of 19

into an established glial scar, but rather targeted transplant prior to scar formation. Nonetheless, hNSCs that
were not predifferentiated prior to transplant were found
to be localized within the glial scar by 28 days and intensely stained with GFAP, indicating posttransplant differentiation. Undifferentiated hNSCs also displayed a
significantly greater proliferative capacity as indicated by
Ki67 immunoreactivity compared with predifferentiated
cells, confirming their capacity for self-renewal and
expansion after transplant. Interestingly, a small subpopulation of undifferentiated hNSCs spontaneously
differentiated into Tuj1 and GABA-expressing neurons by 28 days, demonstrating their ability to enter a
neuronal lineage despite a greater propensity towards
glial cell formation [55, 56].
In contrast to the above, immunohistochemical analysis of predifferentiated GABAergic cell transplants revealed robust expression of Tuj1, GABA, and GAD
within the cell bodies, confirming their GABAergic
neuronal phenotype 28 days post transplant, even in the
severely damaged brain. Predifferentiated cells displayed
low levels of proliferative potential, without aberrant
transdifferentiation. Furthermore, they did not revert
back to an undifferentiated state, suggesting these cells
could be a safe source for transplantation. As such, predifferentiating cells into neurons prior to transplant may
provide a better treatment option by reducing the risk of
contributing to glial scar and tumor formation [71]. Future studies investigating the effects of undifferentiated
hNSC or predifferentiated cell transplants on nonneuronal host cells would be of great interest to determine the extent of their influence and thus provide a
well-rounded perspective of their potential.
Neuronal repopulation and trophic support for functional
recovery

How GABAergic transplants improve the recovering
brain is yet to be fully determined. GABAergic neurons are the principal inhibitory cells of the mammalian
central nervous system and occur throughout the brain,
and GABA regulates the proliferation of neural progenitor cells [72, 73], migration [74], and other aspects of
neurogenesis including differentiation [75, 76], neurite
formation [77], and synaptogenesis [78]. Possible mechanisms of recovery following stroke injury therefore include neuronal repopulation to bridge the gap between
damaged circuits, rescue or reactivation of dormant but
surviving circuitry, and trophic influences on endogenous neurogenesis and neuronal reconstruction.
In our study, GABAergic cells transplanted into the
striatum resulted in >30 % new neurons expressing immunohistochemical markers that are typically expressed
by striatal GABAergic medium-sized spiny projection
neurons and aspiny interneurons, being positive for

Abeysinghe et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2015)6:8

GABA, GAD, Tuj1, and CBPs that are essential components for restoring neurotransmission [79–83]. Whilst
grafts to the core infarct were clearly isolated by the
glial scar barrier by 28 days, grafts within the border
zone appeared to be better positioned to influence host
circuitry and promote recovery. Future studies using anterograde and retrograde labeling would be required to
substantiate connectivity of graft cells to host neural
systems [84].
GABAergic cell transplants also upregulated markers
that were absent at the time of transplant, indicating further maturation in vivo to potentially aid recovery. In our
study, only predifferentiated cells expressed SYN, a presynaptic vesicle protein, suggesting increased synaptic
vesicle formation with potential roles in neurotransmission and plasticity [85–87]. The localization of SYN to the
cellular cytoskeleton of grafts within the peri-infarct territory could indicate a more advanced state of maturation
compared with grafts within the core infarct. Furthermore,
only predifferentiated cells were observed to express the
intracellular CBPs CB, CR, and PV, potentially indicating
calcium signaling events associated with neurotransmission, transmitter release, and plasticity [88, 89]. Overall,
paracrine delivery of GABA, upregulated SYN, and CBP
expression may restore neurotransmission and promote
plasticity to improve behavioral outcomes.
Another possible outcome of GABAergic transplant
is the awakening of depressed pathways known to lie
dormant following stroke [90–92], either through restoration of neurotransmission or graft-induced enhancement
of neurogenesis to stimulate pathways and influence repair. Trophic and chemoattractive functions exerted by interneurons during development through the release of
depolarizing GABA may be recapitulated by GABAergic
transplants to promote proliferation/migration of endogenous progenitor cells, provide positional cues to migrating cells including immature neurons, and influence
synapse maturation [52, 93, 94]. This is concordant with
the human GABAergic transplants in our study potentially
being immature and therefore excitatory through release
of depolarizing GABA as the switch to an inhibitory
phenotype that only occurs late in the first postnatal year
in humans [95]. Furthermore, within the ipsilateral SVZ,
only predifferentiated cell-treated animals displayed
GFAP-positive radial glial cells with long processes known
to function in guiding immature neurons during neurogenesis [96]. Although the endogenous neurogenic response purportedly increases 7–14 days post stroke and
returns to normal beyond this time [97], the apparent increase in activity within the neurogenic niche in our study
35 days post stroke suggests a trophic influence from
transplanted GABAergic cells. In addition, the low neurogenic response observed in vehicle-treated animals 35
days post stroke supports previous reports demonstrating

Page 16 of 19

basal neurogenesis levels beyond 2 weeks post stroke in
rats [97]. Trophic factors secreted from migrating endogenous progenitor cells and immature neurons, or
GABAergic transplants themselves, could therefore act to
stimulate rewiring or awakening of host circuits, enabling
remaining healthy tissue to restore function of lost connections [92, 98, 99].

Conclusion
Findings from this study demonstrate predifferentiating
SVZ-hNSCs prior to transplantation as a novel strategy to
accelerate functional recovery after cerebral ischemia. In
contrast, undifferentiated hNSC transplants have the potential to delay or hinder functional improvements through
contributions to further scar formation. Neuronal repopulation through GABAergic neuronal transplants may achieve
greater viability in a clinical setting by targeting a smaller ischemic region, as seen in lacunar strokes [100, 101]. However, GABAergic transplants also show promise for targeting
severe stroke through production of GABA, synaptogenesis,
and calcium signaling events associated with neurotransmission, to bridge the gap between damaged pathways, enhance
plasticity, or rescue depressed circuitry to re-establish function. Alternatively, known trophic effects of depolarizing
GABA during development may be recapitulated in our
study to enhance endogenous neurogenesis, reactivate circuitry, and promote plasticity for functional recovery in severe strokes with widespread damage. The principles behind
differentiation of hNSCs into a desired neuronal cell type
may be a favorable alternative for treating stroke.
