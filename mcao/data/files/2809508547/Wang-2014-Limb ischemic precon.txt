Abstract
Ischemic brain injury is not uncommon after open-heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and seriously undermines
the patients’ life quality. Therefore, potential protective effects of limb ischemic preconditioning (LIP) on subsequent
ischemic injury of the brain were investigated by evaluating anti-inflammatory effects and apoptosis of pyramidal neurons
in the CA1 hippocampus. One hundred and eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) group (n=54) and the LIP group (n=54). A thread was used to occlude the middle cerebral artery
in the MCAO group and the LIP group animals were pretreated with LIP followed by MCAO. In the two groups, nine
samples were collected at each time-point of 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after MCAO to detect IL-6 and IL-17 and their
mRNA levels. Neurological severity scores (NSS) were examined before the animals were sacrificed. Compared with the
LIP group, cerebral histopathological changes in the MCAO group were most distinct and significantly more infiltrated
inflammatory and apoptotic neuronal cells were observed at 24, 48 and 72 h post-surgery. IL-17 and IL-6 mRNA levels
analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (qRT-PCR) were significantly reduced in the LIP
group compared with the MCAO group at the 12, 24 and 48 h time-points. A significant reduction in IL-17 expression
level was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the LIP group at 12, 24 and 48 h, while IL-6
was significantly reduced at the 24 and 48 h time-points. The NSSs were not significantly different between the groups.
Therefore, in a MCAO rat model, we have proved that LIP pretreatment can protect the brain from infarction after
ischemic injury and induce ischemic tolerance, potentially, by reducing IL-17 to provide anti-inflammatory effects and
attenuate apoptosis of hippocampal neuronal cells.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke, a devastating condition with a complex
pathophysiology, is the leading cause of adult disability,
with approximately 60-80% patients surviving at least one
year remaining dependent on others.1 Due to the increase
of life expectancy globally, stroke will continue to be a
medical challenge and a large socioeconomic burden.
The phenomenon of a brief episode of mild ischemia
rendering an organ resistant to subsequently more severe
ischemic injury is known as ischemic preconditioning
(IPC) and is one of the most powerful anti-ischemic
strategies in laboratory models. The IPC-induced protective effect was identified first in the heart and then in
a variety of organs, such as the lung, liver and brain.2
More recent evidence showed that inducing ischemia in
one organ can augment ischemic tolerance (IT) in a different distant organ.3,4 Limb ischemic preconditioning

(LIP), which is effective for the heart and skeletal muscle,
has significant clinical advantages since the limb is easy
to handle and relatively resistant to ischemic injury.5
However, the mechanism of LIP is not completely clear
and requires further study.
Immune-mediated reactions that intensify inflammation participate in the progression of cerebral ischemic
injury. Inflammatory cells and cytokines play key roles in
the neuronal injury processes and TNF-α and interleukins (ILs) have been shown to be involved in the initiation and development of cerebral ischemia.6 IL-17, the
biological function of which has recently been elucidated, is among those cytokines implicated in ischemic
brain injury.7 However, the mechanism and function of
IL-17 in the ischemic hemisphere of rats after MCAO
and in the peripheral blood of patients with cerebral
infarction has not been studied.
In this study, LIP was applied 24 h before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as a late preconditioning
paradigm that induces tolerance within hours to days
after stimulus.8 Using this model, the present study was
designed to investigate the effect of LIP on ischemic cerebral injury and to confirm whether LIP-induced neuroprotection is associated with temporal changes in the
expression of both IL-6 and IL-17.

Materials and Methods
Animal Subjects
All experiments were performed on adult SpragueDawley male rats (age 4–5 weeks and weighing 180–200
g) obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of
Silaike, Shanghai, PR China. The animals were housed
under standard conditions for 2 days at 26°C at a constant humidity of 55–60% under a 12 h light/dark cycle.
Free access to food and water were provided until the day
of surgery. The experimental protocols used in this study
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at the School of Medicine of Shanghai, Jiao
Tong Medical University and confirmed to meet international guidelines on the ethical use of animals.
One hundred and eight Sprague Dawley rats were
used to construct MCAO and LIP models. All animals
were randomly divided into either the MCAO group or
the LIP group, fifty-four in each group. A thread was
used to occlude the middle cerebral artery in the MCAO
group and the LIP group were pretreated with LIP followed by MCAO. Nine samples at six time-points (0, 6,
12, 24, 48 and 72 h after the MCAO procedure) were collected from both groups. Three of the nine rats were used
to observe histopathological changes and to count the
number of infiltrated inflammatory cells and living neuronal cells by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining,

while the others were used to survey the IL-17 and IL-6
expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
The animals sacrificed at 0 h after MCAO were used as
baseline controls.

Materials
Commercially obtained materials included Trizol
(15596026, Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY, USA), RNA Later solution (HL0006, Ambion,
Monza, Italy), RT kit (A3500, Promega BioSciences LLC,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA), PCR kit (DRR041A, Takara,
Japan), IL-17 ELISA kit (MRK0016-96T, Maibio, Cuba)
and IL-6 ELISA kit (MRK0004-96T, Maibio, Cuba).

Surgery Procedures
Four percent chilled chloral hydrate (0.35 ml/100 g) was
intraperitoneally injected into rats before surgery as anesthetic. The LIP procedure was similar to that described
previously, with a few modifications. Ischemia was
induced in the ipsilateral femoral triangle of the hind
limb by placing an artery clamp on the proximal part of
the limb femoral artery for 6 min; in total, there were 3
cycles of ischemia to the limb with a 6-min reperfusion in
between.9 Twenty-four hours after LIP, cerebral ischemia
was induced according to the MCAO procedure, modified from the filament method described previously.10 All
experimental rats had the right middle cerebral artery
(MCA) permanently occluded by inserting a nylon
monofilament through the right external carotid artery
(ECA). For MCAO, the right common carotid artery
(CCA), the bifurcation of the right internal carotid artery
(ICA) and the right ECA all were exposed via a midline
neck incision. The branches of the ECA were dissected
and coagulated, making it possible to mobilize the ECA.
A monofilament suture was tied loosely around the ECA
and a microvascular clip was placed on the CCA and the
ICA adjacent to the ECA origin. The distal CCA and the
ECA were first ligated with a suture to prevent bleeding
through the incision. A 4–0 monofilament nylon suture
(40 mm in length), the tip of which had been rounded,
was inserted through an arteriectomy of the ICA. When
the tip of the suture occluded the proximal anterior cerebral artery, approximately 17.5–18.0 mm of suture had
been inserted and could be wedged into the circle of
Willis to occlude the opening of the MCA. For the rats
sacrificed at 0 h, the neck incision was exposed to the
MCA, but no suture was inserted. The rats were sacrificed
with an overdose of chloral hydrate at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and
72 h after MCAO and were perfused with saline and 4%
paraformaldehyde solution or prepared for analysis by
qRT-PCR and ELISA. The rectal temperature was

maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5°C using a thermostatically controlled heating pad, both during surgery and the recovery
period until the animal regained consciousness. Rats that
had lost their righting reflex, had dilated pupils and did
not have seizures were selected for the experiments. The
mortality rate after ischemia was ~15%.

Determination of Neurological Scores
Before the MCAO procedure, the rats which would be
sacrificed at 0 h were examined with a neurological
severity score (NSS) as baseline. Nine rats in each group
were evaluated with NSS for functional outcome before
decapitation at 6h, 12h, 24h, 48h, and 72h post-MCAO,
in a blinded fashion. The scoring method grades the
behavioral expression of rats and assesses the degree of
cerebral injury.11 Neuromuscular function consists of six
subtests: forelimb flexion, twisting, resistance to lateral
pushing, circling, hind limb placement and inverted
angle board gripping. The NSS of each subtest was
assigned as follows.11 A score of 0 or 0.5 was given for
normal or mild symptoms, respectively. A score of 1 was
given when the forelegs were bent upon suspending the
rat by the tail, moving in any direction; however, when
the rat was pulled up by the tail, the gripping force of the
forelegs was reduced, turning to the opposite side or
even remaining limp. Furthermore, the stepping ability
of the hind limb was decreased and the rat eventually slid
down when trying to stand up. A score of 2 was noted
when the rat could not hold its body up on an inclined
board and immediately slid to the bottom. The degree
and severity were graded accordingly for each subtest
and a combined total was taken for each rat. A higher
score indicated a more severe clinical deficit. The minimum score was 0, while the maximum score was 7.

H&E staining and counting of inflammatory
cells and neurons
Rats under anesthesia were perfused intracardially with
normal saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1
mol/L sodium phosphate buffer at 4°C (pH 7.4). The
brains were removed quickly from the skull and further
fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C. Postfixed brains were conventionally dehydrated in ethanol
solutions, sequentially increasing up to 100%, immersed
in xylene and embedded in paraffin. Coronal sections (4
µm thickness) were cut at the level of the bregma on a
microtome. The sections were stained with H&E and
examined under a light microscope (DM-LB2, Leica,
Solms, Germany). The numbers of inflammatory cells
infiltrated in the ischemic brain were counted using a
deﬁned rectangular ﬁeld area at lower (100×)
magniﬁcation and the nuclei were shown as blue or

hyperchromatic. Ischemic neuronal damage was evaluated qualitatively on tissue sections from the hippocampus CA1 region, dentate gyrus and parietal cortex.
Normal-appearing neurons and neurons showing features of ischemic cell death (shrunken cell bodies, triangulated, pyknotic nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm)
were counted using a deﬁned rectangular ﬁeld area with
lower (100×) and higher (400×) magniﬁcations. Numbers
of surviving neurons in the hippocampal CA1 layer per 1
mm length and in the parietal cortex adjacent to both the
hippocampus and striatum per 1 mm2 were counted to
determine neuron density.12 Inflammatory cells and neurons were counted under light microscopy by an investigator blinded to the experimental procedure.

qRT-PCR Analysis
Animals were sacriﬁced by an injection of chloral
hydrate and decapitation. The brain structures were
randomly and blindly assigned for further mRNA
extraction and quantiﬁcation. The ipsilateral hemisphere was washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), immediately soaked in RNA later solution
(HL0006, Ambion) and then homogenized in Trizol
reagent (15596026, Invitrogen) with a glass homogenizer, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Samples were put in a sterile microcentrifuge tube with
0.5 ml Trizol, purified using chloroform, precipitated
with isopropanol and dissolved with RNase-free water.
First-strand cDNA was synthesized with 1 μg of total
RNA from each sample and 1 μl of oligo (dT) primer
using the Power cDNA Synthesis kit (A3500, Promega).
The cDNA (2 μl) was amplified with SYBR® Green PCR
Master Mix (DRR041A, Takara Bio Inc., Japan) in a final
volume of 50 μl. The ABI prism 7000 sequence detector
(ABI Prism® 7000, Applied Biosystems, Life
Technologies) was used to measure mRNA expression
levels of IL-17 and IL-6 in the brain tissue. The primers
used (summarized in Table 1) were all individually
designed and tested by Shanghai Sangon (Biotech Co.
Ltd., Shanghai, China). The reaction conditions consisted of an initial activation step (30 sec at 95°C) and a
cycling step (denaturation for 5 sec at 95°C and annealing for 31 sec at 60°C for 40 cycles). All reactions were
carried out at least in duplicate for every sample and
melting curve analysis was performed after each run.
Cycling threshold (Ct) values for IL-17 and IL-6 were
normalized to that of the endogenous glyceraldehyde
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) control and relative expression levels were quantified by the 2−ΔΔCt
method,13 with relative fold changes normalized to control values. As no relative changes of GAPDH were
observed in the qRT-PCR experiments between groups,
it was used as a housekeeping gene.

sected at the location of cortical impact. Each tissue was
weighed in the receiving tube and homogenized in 4 volumes per weight of 1× PBS buffer containing a protease
inhibitor cocktail (P8340, Sigma Aldrich Biotechnology,
St Louis, MI, USA) utilizing a glass homogenizer. Brain
homogenates were centrifuged at 23,300 rpm for 30 min
at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and
used for ELISA analysis. Protein concentrations of the
samples were quantiﬁed using a NANODROP 2000
spectrophotometer (nd-2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Cytokines expressed in
response to MCAO and LIP were detected in the cerebral
tissue supernatants after homogenization. Concentrations
of IL-6 and IL-17 at different time-points in the supernatants were measured by ELISA according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In brief, the supernatants and
standards were coated onto 96-well plates in 100 µl/ well,
which were sealed and then incubated for 2 h at 37°C.
The plates were then rinsed 5 times by adding wash buffer to each well, waiting 30 sec before draining and then
patting dry. Subsequently, biotin-labeled secondary antibodies were added and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After
extensive washing, the plates were treated with streptavidin for color development and the absorbance was read
at 450 nm. The sensitivity of the assay was 16 pg/ ml.

Statistical Analysis
The results were expressed as the mean ± standard
deviation (χ−±SD). Differences between groups were
evaluated for significance by unpaired Student’s
t-tests (SPSS program version 13.0; SPSS, San Rafael,
CA, USA). p<0.05 was considered as statistically
signiﬁcantly different. Data analysis was performed
at the conclusion of the project after all the data were
collected.

The neurological score of 0 h was considered as baseline.
Six hours after cerebral ischemic injury, rats of both
groups showed the same distribution of scores between 4
and 6, which were significantly different from the baseline (Table 2).

Histology changes and inflammatory cell
count in H&E stained neural tissues
Observations of H&E stained sections of cortices
obtained at each time-point revealed no pathology
changes in the baseline control cortex (Figure 1A, G),
while the MCAO and LIP groups at 6 h after onset of
ischemic injury showed a moderate level of inflammatory responses in the cerebral region throughout the
infarct-damaged brain tissue (Figure 1B). Furthermore,
some leukocytes were observed entering the brain
parenchyma at 12 h (Figure 1C). Specifically, inflammatory responses were dramatically up-regulated during the ischemia period, but mildly decreased in the
cortex of the LIP group at the 6 and 12 h time-points
(Figure 1H, I) (p=0.83, and 0.74, respectively, Table 3).
In addition, much more tissue damage (brain tissue
edema, severe vascular spaces, liquefaction necrosis of
cortex and basal ganglia region) was evident at 24–72 h
and with elevated staining of infiltrated leukocytes
observed in the cerebral cortex and parenchyma (Figure
1D, E, F). However, inflammatory responses with the
selective induction of LIP were further down-regulated
compared to those of the MCAO group at 24, 48 and 72
h (Figure 1D, E, F, J, K, L) (p=0.046, 0.030 and 0.011,
respectively, Table 3). The number of inflammatory
cells infiltrated decreased between 6-9% from 24 h to
72 h. These findings suggested that LIP could reduce
MCAO-induced inflammatory reactions.

could be seen (Figure 2B, C). On the other hand, the LIP
group also induced neural cell death at the same timepoint to an apparently lesser degree (Figure 2H, I), but
there was no statistically significant difference between
the two groups. Furthermore, at 24, 48 and 72 h, increasing numbers of CA1 pyramidal cells became damaged.
Preconditioning before ischemic insult resulted in significantly increased neuronal density compared to the
group with ischemic insult alone (Figure 2D, E, F, G, K,
L) (=0.042, 0.027, and 0.022, respectively, Table 4). It
showed that the survival neuron cells increased about
18-30%. These findings suggested that LIP reduced neuronal cell death.

qRT-PCR analysis of IL-6 expression
To investigate the effect of LIP on ischemia-induced
expression of inflammatory cytokines in the cortex, IL-6
mRNA levels (measured by qRT-PCR) were determined
in the ipsilateral side after MCAO. Compared to the
baseline, IL-6 mRNA levels were markedly increased in
the MCAO group at 12 and 24 h (Figure 3). The increase
in IL-6 gene expression was significantly repressed in the
LIP group, especially at 12, 24 and 48 h (p=0.007, 0.001
and 0.001, respectively, Figure 3). Furthermore, the level
of IL-6 transcripts decreased in the LIP group, but there
was no statistically significant difference compared to
the MCAO group at the 72 h time-point. Taken together,
these findings suggested that LIP could reduce MCAOinduced IL-6 mRNA expression at the early stage of ischemia in the cortex.

qRT-PCR analysis of IL-17 expression

groups after ischemia at various time-points (100×). Animals
were subjected to MCAO (global ischemia by the right middle
cerebral artery occlusion paradigm) or LIP (preconditioning by
clamping the proximal limb femoral arteries). At different timepoints, brains were fixed with paraformaldehyde, followed by the
preparation of coronal sections from paraffin-embedded brains
and subsequent staining with H&E to observe neuronal cells in
layers of the hippocampus (n=3). Images of hippocampal CA1
areas at lower magnification (100×) are shown in A-L. Data are
means ± SD. * p<0.05 by unpaired Student’s t-tests.

Neuronal cell counts
Whether preconditioning could increase neuronal cell
survival of the hippocampal CA1 region after ischemia
was examined. CA1 pyramidal cells in control rats
showed round and pale stained nuclei by H&E staining
(Figure 2A, G). By contrast, 6 and 12 h after cerebral
ischemia, shrunken abnormal cells with pyknotic nuclei

The effect of LIP on ischemia-induced IL-17 expression
was determined in the cortex. The changes of IL-17
mRNA expression between 6 and 72 h in the hippocampal CA1 region for the MCAO group and LIP group are
shown in Figure 4. Global ischemia induced a marked
increase in the IL-17 mRNA level within 6 h of ischemia.
The expression of IL-17 was maximal at 24 h and diminished within 72 h. In the LIP group, the IL-17 mRNA
level was down-regulated compared to the MCAO group
(p=0.002, 0.006 and 0.039 for 12, 24 h and, 48 h, respectively, Figure 4). The decrease in IL-17 mRNA expression
in the hippocampal CA1 region in the LIP group began
at 24 h and persisted up to 72 h. These findings suggested
that the IL-17 mRNA level was maximally decreased in
the cortex between 12 and 48 h after LIP.

IL-6 protein detection by ELISA
IL-6 protein levels in the cortex were further determined
at different time-points after MCAO or LIP. The ELISA

significantly increased compared to 0 h (control) (p<0.05,
Figure 5). Unlike at the mRNA level, significant differences in IL-6 protein levels were observed only at 24 and
48 h between the MCAO and LIP groups (p=0.019 and
0.036, respectively, Figure 5). These findings suggested
that LIP could down-regulate the expression of IL-6.

IL-17 protein detection by ELISA
A significant increase of IL-17 protein level was observed
in the MCAO group compared to the baseline at 12 h
(p<0.05, Figure 6). Similar to its mRNA levels, IL-17 protein levels increased between 6–72 h in the MCAO group.
At the 12, 24 and 48 h time-points, the increase of IL-17
protein was significantly inhibited in the LIP group
(p=0.030, 0.044 and 0.040, respectively, Figure 6).
Meanwhile, at 6 and 72 h, IL-17 expression was weak,
with no difference between the MCAO and LIP groups
(p=0.596 and 0.228, respectively, Figure 6). These findings suggested that LIP resulted in a reversal of the
MCAO-induced up-regulation of IL-17 during ischemia.

Discussion

sections from paraffin-embedded brains and subsequent staining
with H&E to observe neuronal cells in layers of the hippocampus

results were generally consistent with the mRNA expression levels determined above. The protein expression level
of IL-6 at 12–72 h in both MCAO and LIP groups were

Over decades, many attempts to treat strokes by pharmacologically reducing the human brain’s vulnerability to
ischemia have achieved little success and cerebral ischemic injury remains a leading cause of death, disability
and massive socioeconomic loss worldwide. Since IPC
was described to result in a protective state in the heart,14
similar phenomena have also been observed in brain,15
liver16 and kidney.4 A further study found that regional
IPC protects remote virgin myocardium from subsequent sustained ischemic injury,17 leading to the speculation that IPC of one organ may confer protective effects
to a remote organ. Recent studies suggested that transient ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) of the small intestine or
limb artery can reduce myocardial ischemic injury.18,19
Therefore, the present study focused on whether limb
ischemia by ipsilateral femoral artery occlusion might
play a role in protecting the brain from ischemic injury
and the potential underlying mechanism.
IPC by brief ischemia of a limb to effectively protect
brain, heart, kidney and skeletal muscle has great advantages. IPC is a powerful innate protective mechanism
against ischemic injury, the effects of which have been
observed in a number of mammals, including humans.

Consistent with previous studies, MCAO caused the
death of a great number of neuronal cells and massive
inflammatory responses in the rat brain. In contrast, pretreating the rats with LIP significantly attenuated these
effects. LIP decreased leukocyte infiltration by about
6-9% and increased living neuron cells by about 18-30%,
demonstrating that LIP could protect the brain from
ischemic damage. Less neuron cell death may lead to
smaller infarct size, which decreases the epilepsy incidence rate.20
To investigate the underlying mechanism of the protecting effects caused by LIP, we focused on the effects of
LIP on inflammatory cytokines, since IPC has been
shown to be associated with ameliorating the inflammatory reaction, reflected by decreased levels of TNF-α,
IL-1 and IL-6 in cardiac I/R injury21 and IPC with brief
forearm ischemia suppresses pro-inflammatory gene
expression in human circulating leukocytes.22
Additionally, some studies have demonstrated that IL-17
is elevated in the ischemic hemisphere of rats after
MCAO and in the peripheral blood of patients with

cerebral infarction, suggesting that IL-17 may play a pivotal role in ischemic brain injury.7,23 Therefore, this study
aims to detect the changes of IL-17 and IL-6 in the
ischemic hemisphere of MCAO-operated rats and their
potential roles in the protective effect of LIP. Consistent
with previous studies, upon MCAO, the mRNA and protein levels of IL-17 and IL-6 increased first and started to
decrease 48 hours after the operation. In contrast, LIP
treatment significantly decreased the mRNA and protein
levels of IL-17 and IL-6 at any given time point, suggesting that LIP causes shifts in IL-6 and IL-17 gene/protein
expression in the ischemic cortex. Besides LIP, some
strategies, such as hypothermia and melanocortins, have
protective effects on ischemic brain injury by antiinflammatory reaction and have long-lasting results.24,25
In our MCAO model, patterns of IL-6 and IL-17
expression were similarly regulated by LIP. Coincident
with the high levels of IL-17 expressed in cerebral tissue,
high levels of spontaneously secreted IL-6 were registered in the ischemic hemisphere, with a peak at 24 h
after MCAO. Since the mRNA and protein levels of IL-17

and IL-6 occurring prior to neuronal damage were maximally increased at 12 h and decreased at 72 h, these
cytokines may play a role in the expansion of ischemic
injury. By observing over a time-course, a correlation
was found between IL-17 and IL-6 levels and LIPinduced protection. These results suggested that both
IL-17 and IL-6 may act as potential mediators in the
remodeling processes after cerebral ischemia. The ability
of the brain to protect itself from ischemic injury in
response to a priming ischemic insult to a distant organ
remains largely unexplored.
In summary, our study demonstrated a significant
protective effect of LIP on ischemic cerebral tissue
despite the existence of a blood brain barrier, potentially
by reducing IL-6 and IL-17. Our study will provide support for further studies using transient LIP to induce a
preconditioned state in the brain and other organs. In
addition, understanding the underlying mechanism of
preconditioning may provide a pharmacological target
to reduce the damage caused by brain ischemia or help to
develop a non-invasive therapeutic approach that could
mimic the protecting effects of preconditioning.
