SUMMARY
Aims: Blood–brain barrier (BBB) plays significant roles in the circumstance maintains for
the central nervous system (CNS). The dysfunction of the BBB could occur in all pathological conditions of CNS diseases, such as ischemic stroke, cerebral edema, or inflammatory
disorders. However, the comparisons among different animal models with a broken BBB
in vivo are still need to be further studied. Methods: Here we used three different mice
models in vivo, including MCAO induce, LPS treatment, and cold injury to mimic the situation in clinic. The permeability of BBB in three models was detected by perfusion of Evan’s
blue dye. The functional proteins of the BBB including claudin-5, VE-cadherin, and caveolin-1 were compared in three different models in vivo. Results: With the hyperpermeability
of Evan’s blue in the three models, both claudin-5 and VE-cadherin were decreased, while
the expression of caveolin-1 was increased. Our study showed that BBB dysfunction
induced by MCAO in mice was relatively stable, reliable, and moderate compared with LPS
or cold injury-induced BBB permeability models, although the procedural time was generally long and operation complexity was hard. Moreover, our study also found that the
model of the increased BBB permeability by cold injury was severe in the regional cerebral
tissue and the model treated with LPS was mild in the global cerebral tissue. The operation
of the two models in vivo was easy, quick, and stable. Conclusion: The MCAO model was
the most suitable for studying the permeability of BBB among the three models in vivo.

Introduction
Blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a dynamic interface between the
peripheral blood circulation and the central nervous system (CNS).
By avoiding ions and molecules out of the CNS, allowing oxygen
and nutrients into the CNS according to the need of the neural
cells, BBB sustains a stable environment for the CNS to function
well [1,2]. The BBB is formed by the neurovascular unit (including
endothelial cells, astrocytes, glia, and neurons), in which the cerebral blood vessels formed by endothelial cells are the core anatomical elements [3]. The endothelial cells in the CNS are unique with
that in peripheral tissues, for lacking fenestrations and undergoing
extremely low rates of transcytosis [2]. The adherent junctions
(AJ) and tight junctions (TJ) between the endothelial cells
reflected the paracellular permeability of endothelial cells, while
the caveolae reflected the transcellular of the endothelial cells.
The permeability of the BBB increases in almost all CNS diseases, such as ischemic stroke, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epileptic seizures, brain

trauma, and diabetes mellitus [4–8]. It remains uncertain whether
BBB dysfunction is one of the initial events that lead to the CNS
diseases, or whether is a downstream consequence [2]. This needs
the development of BBB models in physiological and in pathological conditions. In vitro cell-culture-based models of BBB have been
greatly developed to predict the permeability of drug candidates.
However, the current challenge lies in developing in vivo models
which retain fundamental BBB characteristics and include difficulty, stability, reproduction, high-throughput capacity, and accurate drug permeability prediction.
Cold injury induces brain trauma with early development of
edema and delayed infarction. The injury model displays focal
neuronal damage that is similar to the pathological events following head trauma [9–12]. This model is used to study the dynamics
of cerebral edema and the time course of BBB breakdown [13].
Ischemic stroke, induced by intraluminal middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) performed in mice, is the second most common cause of death worldwide [14]. After stroke happened, the
disruption of BBB could occur continuously [15]. The model has

been widely used to investigate molecular mechanisms of brain
injury and potential therapeutic modalities [16]. System inflammation, induced by LPS, could induce cerebrovascular inflammation and injury the BBB [17]. However, only limited information
is available on advantage and disadvantage of these BBB models
in mice for the research of BBB.
In this study, we performed the three different in vivo BBB models which have a hyperpermeable BBB to mimic the pathological
conditions in clinic. This study explored Evan’s blue extravasation, the expression of TJ protein claudin-5, AJ protein VE-cadherin, and caveolin-1 in BBB dysfunctional model. We compared
the differences among these models to provide reference data for
future clinical trials and aid investigation of the BBB permeability
of other CNS-active substances.

Materials and Methods

Laboratory Animal Ltd (Shanghai, China). Mice were housed at a
controlled temperature of 22  2°C, relative humidity of 50–60%
in a 12-h: 12-h light: dark cycle and allowed free access to food
and tap water. All animals received humane care, and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines
of Second Military Medical University for health and care of
experimental animals.

and antibody to caveolin-1 was purchased from Abcam
(Hong Kong, China). Secondary antibodies to Cy3-conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-sheep IgG were purchased from Jackson (West Grove, PA, USA). DAPI was purchased
from Beyotime (Shanghai, China). Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical analysis of murine brain tissue was performed to standard produces. Briefly, brains were harvested from
skulls after totally perfused with 4% (wt/vol) PFA and then were
dehydrated in 30% (wt/vol) sucrose for 48 h. Cryostat sections of
16 um thickness were sliced using a cryostat (Leica, Solms, Germany). Frozen cross sections were incubated with antibodies
against caveolin-1 (1:50), claudin-5 (1:50), and VE-cadherin
(1:50), respectively, overnight. Secondary antibodies incubated
were Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200), Alexa Fluor 488
anti-sheep IgG (1:200). The sections were counterstained with
DAPI for the nuclei. Images were acquired using Olympus IX71
fluorescence microscope. All pictures in one group were acquired
with the same settings.

the head was exposed. Then put a 10 g weight in liquid nitrogen,
after the temperature kept stable with liquid nitrogen, lay the
weights on the skull for 30 seconds. Then the mice were recovered for the next detections.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) Injury
Mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate in 350 mg/kg.
MCAO surgery in mice was performed as described by Koizumi’s
method [16]. The middle skin incision was made to expose the
common carotid artery. A standardized silicon-coated monofilament was inserted into the common carotid artery toward the
internal carotid artery until bending was observed or resistance
was felt. The core temperature (rectum) was maintained at
37°C  0.5°C. The stability of experiments was ensured by the
neurological deficits and TTC staining [18].

LPS Treatment Injury

culating for 2 h, the mice were perfused with normal saline until
the colorless liquid flowing from the heart. The brains were harvested for further analyzing. Evan’s blue dye could be detected
using a 633 nm laser [19]. To further compare Evan’s blue dye
extracted to the parenchyma of the brain cortex, we detected the
specimen cross section under fluorescence microscope. Brains
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then dehydrated for
cytoprotection in 30% (wt/vol) sucrose. After the specimens were
frozen, 16-lm serial cryostat sections were made for next fluorescence image detection.

Statistical Analysis
All quantified data are presented as mean  SEM. Image Pro Plus
was used to obtain the area of Evan’s blue effused in the specimen. We used Student’s t-test to check for statistical significance
between groups. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significance.

Mice were given a single injection of 30 mg/kg of LPS diluted in
saline intraperitoneally.

vein to the mice. After 2-h circulation, the mice were sacrificed to
harvest the brains. Representative photographs were taken to
compare the tracer effusion level directly. In sham group (Figure 1A), the BBB was integrity, and no obvious tracer diffused
into the cortex. In the mice treated with LPS 30 mg/kg for 24 h,
the degree of diffusion was higher, and the cortex remained in a
light blue color in the whole brains (Figure 1B). After MCAO performed 24 h, the permeability of the BBB in the ipsilateral hemisphere was higher than the contralateral hemisphere (Figure 1C).
The BBB was dysfunctional in the area contacted to the cold
injury, with obvious blue tracer dye infused, while the other part
remains inaccessible to the Evan’s blue dye (Figure 1D).

Detection of the BBB Breakdown by
Fluorescence Microscopy
To further compare Evan’s blue dye extracted to the parenchyma
of the brain cortex, we detected the specimen cross section under
fluorescence microscope. In physical conditions, no obvious
Evan’s blue dye could be detected in the brain cortex (Figure 2A).
In the group of LPS treatment, the dysfunction of the BBB
appeared in the whole brain. Clearly tracer infusion could be
depicted in the representative photograph. In MCAO model, the
extracted tracer was found extracted in the insult zone of ischemic
stroke, while the contralateral hemisphere remained normal. In
the injury cold model, the effusion of Evan’s blue dye was focused
on the area of the tissue contacting to the source of cold injury
and kept normal in other part of brain tissue, too. The quantita-

tion of the permeability of Evan’s blue dye was used to evaluate
the BBB dysfunction. Results showed that in the cold injury
group, the BBB dysfunction was more serious than that in LPS
treatment group and in MCAO group (Figure 2B).

Immunofluorescence Staining Patterns of
Standard Proteins
To further investigate the influences of BBB dysfunction on the
changes of typical proteins expressed in brain microvascular
endothelial cells, the proteins such as claudin-5 (Figure 3), VEcadherin (Figure 4), and caveolin-1 (Figure 5) were chosen. The
expression of claudin-5 in the brain vessels of the cortex decreased
with the treatment of LPS for 24 h. At that time, the morphology
of vessels was still normal. In MCAO mice model, the morphology
of vessels was broken in the insult area. Similar results appeared in
the insult area of cold injury. The expression of VE-cadherin in the
vessels of the brain cortex decreased after the treatment of LPS.
After the performance of MCAO and cold injury, the morphology
of vessels could not be detected clearly. Caveolin-1 showed no differences after the treatment of LPS. After the treatment of MCAO,
the expression increased in the vessels, while the morphology of
the vessels broke down after the treatment of cold injury.

Discussion
It was found in the present study that MCAO model was the most
suitable for studying the permeability of BBB among the three

models in vivo. Our study also demonstrated that the expression of
claudin-5 and VE-cadherin decreased and caveolin-1 increased,
accompanying with the increase of BBB permeability in three
models in vivo. (Shown in Table 1)
The MCAO model, which replicates focal cerebral ischemia in
rodent, has been widely used to study the BBB function. This
model has the advantage of inducing reproducible transient or
permanent ischemia of the middle cerebral artery territory in a
relative noninvasive manner, accompanying with the increase of
BBB permeability. The disadvantage of the model lies in many
variables, such as strain-related differences, size, length, shape
and flexibility of suture tip, duration of occlusion, body temperature, anesthesia, and other factors which can lead to inconsistency
in infarct volumes in this model. However, our study showed that
BBB dysfunction induced by MCAO in mice was relatively stable,
reliable, and moderate compared with LPS or cold injury-induced
BBB permeability model, although the procedural time was generally long and operation complexity was hard. Moreover, our
study also found that the model of the increased BBB permeability
by cold injury was severe in the regional cerebral tissue and the
model treated with LPS was mild in the global cerebral tissue. The
operation of the two models in vivo was easy, quick, and stable.
Taken together, the increased BBB permeability in MCAO model
is more suitable for study the BBB functions, compared with that
in cold injury and LPS-treated models.
The permeability of BBB is mediated by at least two mechanisms: the paracellular pathway and the transcellular pathway.
The former is regulated by the opening and closing of endothelial

572

cells, the later includes vesicular transport systems and fenestrae
and biochemical transporters [20]. There are two major structures controlling the opening and closing of the BBB, tight junction and adherent junction. In this study, claudin-5 and VEcadherin were chosen as the representative proteins of TJs and
AJs, and caveolin-1 as the representative protein of vesicular
transport systems.
Claudin-5 is a critical regulator of BBB permeability. In previous
studies, deletion of claudin-5 in mice affected BBB permeability
against small molecules beyond 800 Da, as a molecular sieve.
Mutant mice without claudin-5 died a few hours after birth
[21,22]. In the present study, we found that the expression level
of claudin-5 decreased in all the three models. Especially, the morphology of cerebral vessels disrupted in the model of MCAO and
cold injury, suggested a more severe dysfunction of BBB in both
of the two models.
VE-cadherin is an endothelial-specific cell-to-cell adhesion protein in the AJ, playing a significant role in the control of endothelial cell permeability and integrity [23]. Both the phosphorylation
and the cleavage of VE-cadherin could induce vascular permeability [20]. VE-cadherin gene knockout is lethal in mouse embryos,
interfering with which in adult mice affects the vascular integrity
in vivo, and blocking its adhesive function influenced the endothelial barrier maintenance in vitro [24]. In our study, we found that
the expression of VE-cadherin decreased in the model of MCAO,
accompanied with the other two models in vivo, too.
Caveolin-1 is a major component of caveolae, mainly
expressed in vessels in the CNS [25], and has a role in vesicular

experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animal model
[26]. Similar to Nag’s et al. study [13], we also found that the
expression of caveolin-1 increased in the cold injury model, and
the vessels contacting the liquid nitrogen lost its morphology.
Moreover, the expression of caveolin-1 increased in the LPS
treatment group and the MCAO group. With the hyperpermeability of Evan’s blue in the three diseases animal models, we

speculated that the caveolin-1 increased with the BBB dysfunction.
In summary, we chose three representative proteins as molecular explanations of the broken to the BBB, which was coincident
with previous studies. Moreover, we compared the complexity
and the stability among the three models in vivo. Damaging the
BBB permeability by MCAO was relatively convenient of manipulation, reliable and moderate BBB model in vivo to date, compared
with LPS and cold injury-induced dysfunction of the BBB.
