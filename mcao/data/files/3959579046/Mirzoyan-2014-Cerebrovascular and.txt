Objectives. The influence of 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on was studied on the rats’ brain blood flow and on morphological state
of brain tissue under the condition of brain ischemia. The interaction of the substance with NMDA receptors was also studied.
Methods. Study has been implemented using the methods of local blood flow registration by laser flowmeter, [3 H]-MK-801binding,
and morphological examination of the brain tissue. We used the models of global transient ischemia of the brain, occlusion of
middle cerebral artery, and hypergravity ischemia of the brain. Results. Unlike memantine, antagonist of glutamatergic receptors,
the 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on does not block NMDA receptors but enhances the cerebral blood flow of rats with brain ischemia.
This effect is eliminated by bicuculline. Under conditions of permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery, 5-hydroxyadamantane2-on has recovered compensatory regeneration in neural cells, axons, and glial cells, and the number of microcirculatory vessels
was increased. 5-Hydroxyadamantane-2-on was increasing the survival rate of animals with hypergravity ischemia. Conclusions.
5-Hydroxyadamantane-2-on, an adamantane derivative, which is not NMDA receptors antagonist, demonstrates significant
cerebrovascular and neuroprotective activity in conditions of brain ischemia. Presumably, the GABA-ergic system of brain vessels
is involved in mechanisms of cerebrovascular and neuroprotective activity of 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on.

1. Introduction
The brain ischemia is accompanied by a cascade of pathophysiological and biochemical processes caused by oxygen
and energy deficiency as well as functional changes like
failure of balance between excitatory and inhibitory processes in CNS, which leads to irreversible damage of the
neural tissue. The decrease in the rate of aerobic glycolysis
brings, to intracellular acidosis, decrease in work efficiency
of the sodium-potassium pump, changes in ionic gradients,
enhanced discharge of excitatory amino acid glutamate, high
concentrations of which cause increased flow of calcium ions
into the cell, and activation of enzyme systems. Under these
conditions the process of oxidative phosphorylation fails and
toxins and free radicals, including NO, are produced; lipid

peroxidation is activated and oxidative stress develops. All
this results in damage of cytoplasmic organelles’ membrane
proteins and molecules of DNA and RNA, while expression
of immediate early genes triggers the mechanism of cell death
through necrosis or apoptosis [1–4].
It should be noted that GABA system is of high interest
in conditions of brain ischemia, as GABA-ergic mechanisms
play important role in terms of removing the imbalance
between excitatory and inhibitory systems in CNS. It was
demonstrated that concentration of GABA increases in early
stages of ischemia and the high concentration of agonist
usually leads to decreased sensitivity of receptors through
negative feedback mechanism [5, 6]. There are also literature
data stating that compounds, enhancing GABA-ergic transmission, have neuroprotective activity. These are agonists

2
and modulators of GABAA receptors, inhibitors of GABA
transaminase, and GABA reuptake inhibitors [6]. GABA
system, along with participation in inhibitory processes,
plays important role in regulation of cerebral vascular tone.
It is known that brain vessels contain GABA, as well as
enzymes synthesizing and metabolizing GABA [7–9]. In pial
vessels a high affinity of binding with GABAA receptors was
observed at muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist [10]. Earlier
we showed that substances with GABA-ergic mechanism of
action cause selective improvement of cerebral blood flow in
conditions of ischemic damage of the brain [11–15].
Our attention was attracted by adamantane derivatives,
which are able to block NMDA receptors and are widely used
in neurological practice. Amantadine and memantine are
used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Memantine in experiments prevents the development of neurotoxicity provoked by activation of NMDA receptors. It also blocks
N-cholinoreceptors. Memantine improves cognitive functions in patients with mild to moderate vascular insufficiency
[16, 17]. An adamantane derivative, 5-hydroxyadamantane-2on, has ability to improve the blood supply of lower extremities in patients with chronic occlusive (obliterative) arterial
disease of lower extremities [18].
In compliance with this, the aim of the current study was
the comparative investigation of effects of 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on and memantine on cerebral blood flow of intact
rats and rats exposed to global transient brain ischemia. The
study aimed also to investigate neuroprotective activity of 5hydroxyadamantane-2-on in conditions of local permanent
brain ischemia caused by occlusion of middle cerebral artery,
with evaluation of morphological state of brain tissue. The
survival rate of rats with hypergravity ischemia also was the
objective of the study. There are some materials included in
current study that analyze the mechanism of cerebrovascular
and neuroprotective activity of studied substance.

2. Materials and Methods
Experiments of studying the brain blood flow were conducted
on 76 narcotized (urethane 1.2 g/kg, i/p) nonlinear male rats
weighting 180–400 g. Experiments of middle cerebral artery
occlusion were conducted on 28 nonlinear male rats weighting 250–300 g, narcotized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg,
i/p). 50 wakeful rats were involved in experiments with
hypergravity ischemia and brains of 6 male Wistar rats (200–
250 g) were used in experiments of radioligand binding.
The state of cerebral blood circulation in animals was estimated by the method of laser Doppler flowmetry. To register
the local cerebral blood flow in parietal lobe of the brain
cortex, BIOPAC MP100 system (USA) with laser Doppler
flow module LDF100C was used; LD channel was calibrated
in TPU (tissue perfusion unit) because this unit has better
(∼1) proportion to mL/min/100 grams of tissue than BPU
(default unit for LDF100C). The 08 mm diameter needleshaped detector of flowmeter was placed on the parietal
lobe of the brain cortex of rats using micromanipulator and
balancing arm. Changes of arterial pressure were registered
simultaneously through a polyethylene catheter, preliminary
inserted into the femoral artery. Based on data of detectors

BioMed Research International
of blood flow and pressure, vascular resistance was estimated
in real time. The recording of characteristics of blood flow,
arterial pressure, and vascular resistance was conducted on
polygraph “BIOPAC” (USA), connected with a personal computer. Investigating substances were administered through
the polyethylene catheter into the femoral vein of animals.
The global transient ischemia in rats was achieved by
10-minute occlusion of both common carotid arteries with
simultaneous decrease of arterial pressure down to 40–
50 mm Hg, using method of bloodletting and following
reperfusion.
The local permanent ischemia was obtained by the
method of Tamura et al. [19], modified by Topchian et al. [20].
The morphological state of brain tissue was assessed on
6th and 12th days after occlusion of middle cerebral artery.
These intervals were chosen based on existing literature data,
according to which the most profound structural changes
in the brain after occlusion of middle cerebral artery in rats
are seen on 6th and 12th days [20, 21]. Animals were decapitated on 6th or 12th day after operation. The brain was
extracted and fixed in 10% neutral solution of formaldehyde
during the preparation for morphological examination and
then sagittal incision was done including tissue supplied by
middle cerebral artery. Furthermore, the tissue was fixed in a
paraffin block. This block was sliced step by step into tissue
specimens and was stained with universal histological dye,
hematoxylin/eosin.
The first two series of morphological examination were
done on two control groups of animals which underwent an
occlusion of middle cerebral artery and were decapitated after
6 and 12 days, respectively.
In the following series of experiments animals were
involved with occlusion of middle cerebral artery and treated
with 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on (100 mg/kg, i/p, once daily)
30 minutes after the occlusion and the following 6 and 12 days,
respectively.
To study the survival rate of animals in conditions of
hypergravity loading [22] wakeful rats were placed into
special containers of centrifuge in craniocaudal orientation
relatively to the vector of acceleration. In case of craniocaudal
vector of acceleration (9 g during 12 minutes) the movement
of blood occurs towards caudal orientation: as a result, the
perfusion pressure falls dramatically down to the zero in all
vessels of the head and brain ischemia develops.
2.1. Binding to NMDA Receptors. Binding to NMDA receptor
subtype was studied using the method [23] with modifications. Tritium-labeled MK-801 (dizocilpine) with a specific activity of 210 Ci/mol was used [24]. The rat’s hippocampal tissue was homogenized in a Potter homogenizer
(Teflon glass) in 10 volumes of 5 mM HEPES/4.5 mM Tris
buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.32 M sucrose (buffer-1). The
homogenate was diluted with 50 volumes of buffer-2 (5 mM
HEPES/4.5 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.6) and centrifuged for
10 min at 1000 g. The supernatant was taken and again centrifuged for 20 min at 25000 g. The pellet was homogenized
in 50 volumes of buffer-2 and centrifuged for 20 min at
8000 g. The supernatant and its soft unstable upper coat were
taken and centrifuged for 20 min at 25000 g. The resulting

precipitate was suspended in buffer-3 (5 mM HEPES/4.5 mM
Tris buffer containing 1 mM NaEDTA, pH 7.6), and the
suspension was centrifuged again. This washing procedure
was repeated four times, with EDTA being excluded in the
last wash. The final precipitate was resuspended in 5 volumes
of buffer-2 and then stored in liquid nitrogen. The reaction
mixture (final volume 0.5 mL) contained 200 𝜇l of buffer-2,
50 𝜇l of labeled ligand (50 nM solution), and 250 𝜇l of protein
suspension. The nonspecific binding was determined at the
presence of 50 𝜇l of unlabeled ligand. The reaction mixture
was incubated at room temperature (20∘ C) for 2 h. After the
incubation, the samples were filtered through GF/B filters
(Whatman) which were presoaked in 0.3% polyethylenimine
for 2 h at 4∘ C. Each test tube was washed 1 time with cold
buffer-2, and the filters were then washed three times with
the same buffer volume. The filters were dried on air and
transferred to the scintillation vials. The radioactivity was
determined on a Wallac 1411 scintillation counter with a
counting efficiency of approximately 45%.

3. Statistical Analyses
The statistical analysis of data was carried out using the
software Statistica 8.0 (Statistica Inc., USA). The normal
distribution was defined by Shapiro-Wilk test. Generally, normal distribution was lacking; thus for the following analysis
nonparametrical method of Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
used. Survival data of animals in conditions of circulatory
ischemia was calculated by Fisher criterion. GraphPad Prism
5 software was used in experiments of radioligand binding.
Results were considered statistically significant, when 𝑃 <
0.05.

4. Results
4.1. The Influence of Adamantane Derivatives, 5-Hydroxyadamantane-2-on and Memantine, on Local Blood Flow of
Brain Cortex in Intact Rats and Those with Global Transient Ischemia. Experiments on intact rats revealed that 5hydroxyadamantane-2-on with intravenous administration
of dose 100 mg/kg does not cause significant changes in
blood flow of rats’ brain cortex (Figure 1(a)). The adamantane
derivative causes decrease of blood pressure in intact rats
from 30 to 90 minutes by average of 11–14%.
In 10 minutes after intravenous administration of
memantine (5 mg/kg) to intact narcotized rats, the decrease

of local cerebral blood flow by 15% in average was registered.
Further decrease of blood flow was observed, which reached
53% by the end of experiment. Memantine virtually did not
affect the level of arterial blood pressure.
On the next series of experiments the influence of
adamantane derivatives was studied on the brain blood
flow after global transient ischemia. It was shown that
5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on (100 mg/kg, IV) causes slowly
developing increase of local cerebral blood flow, which
reaches its peak after 60 minutes (76.5%). This improvement
of cerebral blood flow over the initial level lasts till the end of
experiment (90 minutes and more) (Figures 1(b) and 2(b)).
In these conditions, adamantane derivative lowers arterial
pressure in rats by 11% in average.
Memantine (5 mg/kg) decreased (though in a less degree)
local cerebral blood flow in the brain cortex of experimental
animals as well as of intact rats. In the same experiment
with memantine, arterial blood pressure failed statistically
significantly by 14% in average.
Thus, the conducted experiments established that cerebrovascular effect of 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on, unlike
memantine, develops in conditions of ischemic brain damage
and is absent in intact animals. It should be noted that
increase of blood flow is a result of the influence of the substance on brain vascular tone. The results of rated resistance
prove this, as adamantane derivatives along with increase in
brain blood flow cause decrease in arterial pressure.
4.2. The Investigation of Neurochemical Mechanisms of Action
of 5-Hydroxyadamantane-2-on. It is known that amino
derivatives of adamantane (amantadine, memantine) possess their protective effects via noncompetitive antagonism
with glutamate for NMDA receptors. However, there is no
evidence of such mechanism for hydroxy derivatives, particularly 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on. Thus, we observed the
influence of this substance on binding of ligand of receptor’s
channel site, [3 H]-MK-801 (dizocilpine), with hippocampal
membranes of rat. This effect was compared with that of
memantine (Figure 6).
Results suggest that memantine actively competes with
labeled dizocilpine in size of IC50 = 1.14 𝜇M (95% confidence intervals: 0.82–1.57 𝜇M, GraphPad Prism 5), while 5hydroxyadamantane-2-on has no effect through the all range
of concentrations.
In further studies we observed the influence of 5hydroxyadamantane-2-on on local brain blood flow while

blocking with bicuculline, a GABAA receptor blocker. This
was reasonable, as substances with GABA-ergic mechanism
of action reveal vasodilating activity in ischemic conditions. Bicuculline was administered by dose 0.5 mg/kg after
ischemic damage of the brain, and then adamantane derivative was administered after 30 minutes. It was found out
that, while blocking of GABA-receptors with bicuculline, 5hydroxyadamantane-2-on does not increase the local brain
blood flow (Figure 2(b)). These results indicate the participation of GABA-ergic mechanisms of cerebrovascular effects of
5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on in brain ischemia.
4.3. The Influence of 5-Hydroxyadamantane-2-on on Morphological State of Brain Tissue after the Occlusion of Middle
Cerebral Artery. To study the neuroprotective activity of
5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on, its influence was observed on
morphological injury of brain tissue provoked by occlusion
of middle cerebral artery.
The morphological examination of specimens of control
group (with occlusion of middle cerebral artery and without
treatment) revealed an expressed perivascular and pericellular edema of brain tissue. In edematous brain tissue there
are visible cells with dystrophy of neuronal cytoplasm and
nucleus, zones of karyorrhexis, karyopyknosis, and karyolysis

of neural and glial cells. Capillars and arterioles in state
of stasis and microthrombosis are seen along with empty
microcirculatory vessels. These arterioles are surrounded by
emptied neural and glial cells (Figure 3(a)). There are zones of
necrobiosis through all layers of cortical cells with wash-out,
lysis of neural and large glial cells’ nucleoplasm. Anuclear,
necrotizing shadow cells as well as areas of dystrophic neurosecretory cells of paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei are
detectible against the background of necrobiosis of cortical
pyramidal cells (Figure 3(b)). Borders of all cortical layers
are cleared. Several hypertrophic neurons with hyperchromic
nuclei are seen between or near the profound ischemic foci.
This indicates the intracellular regeneration of individual
intact neural and glial cells. There are also proliferation
zones of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Similar changes are
registered also in neurosecretory cells located in the basin
of middle cerebral artery. Punctuate and linear hemorrhages,
meningeal edema, stasis in vessels of pia, and dura mater are
seen in intercellular substance. Zones of hemosiderosis are
also visible.
These obtained results correspond to the literature
data of previous studies that showed up bilateral disturbances of brain blood flow, hypoxic damage of cortical
neurocytes, and conduction pathways synaptic terminals

in analogous periods after occlusion of middle cerebral
artery.
In the next two series the influence of 5-hydroxiadamantane-2-on (100 mg/kg, i/p) was studied on morphological
state of brain tissue of rats with occlusion of middle cerebral
artery after 6 (3rd group) and 12 (4th group) days of
treatment.
The morphological changes of brain tissue were examined
on sagittal incisions of brain. This made it possible to detect
tissue changes in regions of both left and right middle cerebral
arteries and to provide comparative morphological picture of
occluded (left) and not occluded (right) hemispheres.
Some neurons and groups of neurons are seen in the state
of necrobiosis on serial tissue specimens of the 3rd group of
animals, in the left hemisphere. Small foci of empty neural
and glial cells and dystrophic changes of pyramidal cells
of brain cortex are also seen. Pericellular and perivascular
edema is marked slightly, vessels of microcirculatory bed
are hyperemic as well as foci of extravasates, and old small
hemorrhages with hemosiderin pigment are seen. Foci of glial
cells’, oligodendrocytes’, and astrocytes’ proliferation are also
found.
Processes of dystrophy and individual cells in conditions of necrosis and necrobiosis are seen in neurosecretory
cells of paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei. Against the
background of above-described changes large hypertrophic
neurosecretory cells are detected in paraventricular and
supraoptic nuclei with the presence of multiple neurosecretory granules.
Similar changes and compensatory-regenerative processes are observed in all pyramidal cells of the cortex
(Figure 4(a)). Axons of above-mentioned hypertrophic neurons are preserved through all length.
There are cells without neurites in the basin of middle
cerebral artery, on the left side, with wrinkled cytoplasm and
nucleus (Figure 4(b)). In ependymal cells of brain ventricles
proliferation is observed, while in sinusoidal vessels hyperemia is observed. In response to harmful, polycystic changes
there is a focal lymphoid-macrophagal reaction in individual
preserved zones of necrosis and edema (Figure 5). There are
also microvessels with obliterating white thrombotic bodies.

Figure 5: Morphological picture of brain tissue of rats with
occlusion of middle cerebral artery after treatment with 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on. Lymphoid-macrophagal reaction is observed in
zones of necrosis and marked edema in response to impaired polycystic changes of brain tissue (staining hematoxylin/eosin ×400).

In the 4th group of animals the treatment with 5-hydroxiadamantane-2-on was conducted in the course of 12 days
after occlusion of middle cerebral artery and the observed
morphological changes had more reparative-regenerative
and proliferative character. In general, the disposition of layers of cortical cells is preserved. There is a slight pericellular
and perivascular edema of meninges and brain tissue along
with hyperemia of microcirculatory vessels. Small foci of
shadow neural and glial cells are visible. In the basin of
left middle cerebral artery there are generally wide zones of
pyramidal neurosecretory and glial cells of normal size, with
precise borders between cytoplasm and nucleus and with
available nucleolus. Granules of neurosecretory substance are
observed in neurosecretory cells. There are ischemic zones in
certain parts of third ventricle, where contours of neurons,
glial cells, neuritis, and neuropile are vague. Hypertrophic
neurocytes with hyperchromic nuclei are observed near these
zones as well as functionally active neurosecretory cells with
multiple secretory granules.
The morphological picture of the right hemisphere in
basin of right middle cerebral artery was also examined
on the same tissue specimens and a following comparison

50–100–150–200 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally. Experiments revealed that the mortality rate from hypergravity
overload is 80% in control group, while survival rate is
20%. After administration of adamantane derivative by the
dose 100 mg/kg, survival rate rises up to 80% (Table 1). In
doses 150–200 mg/kg survival rate was 60%. In these cases
the data are not statistically significant. It can be concluded
that adamantane derivative in doses 100 mg/kg reveals antiischemic effects in conditions of hypergravity ischemia like
its effects in global permanent ischemia.

characteristic of morphological picture was made (the picture
of secondary control on the same animals). There are insignificant perivascular and pericellular edema, hyperemia of
microcirculatory bed in all series of the experiment (in control groups and groups treated with 5-hydroxyadamantane2-on for 6 and 12 days), on the right hemisphere. There are
compensatory-regenerative processes, that is, intracellular
regeneration of organelles, hypertrophy of pyramidal cells
and large glial cells, and increase in number of microcirculatory vessels. These processes are more significant on the
12th day after occlusion. Typically, in conditions of damage
of one part of the brain, other parts of brain or another
hemisphere (right—in this case) compensate and repair
morphofunctional balance of the CNS.
4.4. The Influence of 5-Hydroxyadamantane-2-on on Survival
Rate of Animals in Conditions of Hypergravity Loading. Antiischemic properties of adamantane derivative were observed
on trials with wakeful rats in conditions of hypergravity
loading. 5-Hydroxyadamantane-2-on was studied in doses

This paper introduces new data about cerebrovascular
and neuroprotective activities of adamantane derivative, 5hydroxyadamantane-2-on. Comparative study of cerebrovascular activity was done between two adamantane derivatives:
5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on and memantine, antagonist of
glutamate receptors. There was revealed a substantial difference between their effects on blood flow of ischemic
brain. 5-Hydroxyadamantane-2-on enhances blood flow and
decreases vascular tone of rats with global permanent brain
ischemia and has no such cerebrovascular effects on brains
of intact rats, while memantine decreases blood flow in both
intact and ischemic brains.
Further experiments studied the influence of 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on on NMDA receptors taking into consideration that many adamantane derivatives, memantine
particularly, are able to block NMDA receptors. It was
found out that unlike memantine and many other amino
derivatives of adamantane, 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on does
not interact with this site of NMDA receptors. Moreover, both
of these compounds did not compete with [3 H]-7OH-DPAT
for the binding site of dopamine receptors as well as with
[3 H]-8OH-DPAT and [3 H]-ketanserin for the binding site of
5-HT1A- and 5-HT2A receptors, respectively.
The investigation of neuroprotective activity of 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on in conditions of permanent occlusion
of middle cerebral artery in rats was the other objective
of this study. The compound was administered (100 mg/kg)
30 minutes after occlusion, once daily during 6 and
12 days. Experiments have shown that 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on promotes the recovery of compensatory regeneration
processes in neural cells, axons, glial cells. It also increases the
quantity of vessels of microcirculatory bed. Results obtained
indicate the neuroprotective effects of compound that was
confirmed by results from experiments with hypergravity
ischemia in rats, where survival rate of animals was increased

BioMed Research International
by treatment with the same dose of 5-hydroxyadamantane-2on.
One of neuroprotective mechanisms demonstrated for
5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on was its capacity to enhance the
blood flow of ischemic brain, which was not manifested in the
background of action of specific GABAA -receptor antagonist
bicuculline. This proves the participation of GABA-ergic
mechanisms in regulation of brain vessels’ tone to realize
cerebrovascular effects of studied compound.
As a conclusion, it should be noted that 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on, an adamantane derivative, which is not a
NMDA receptor antagonist, has significant cerebrovascular
and neuroprotective activity in conditions of global and
local brain ischemia which is manifested by enhancement
of blood flow of ischemic brain, prevention of structural
disturbances, and increase in survival rate of animals with
global ischemia provoked by hypergravity loading. It can
be supposed that GABA-ergic system of brain vasculature
has a great value in cerebrovascular and neuroprotective
activities of 5-hydroxyadamantane-2-on. Our results conform to the literature data as well as to the results of our own
preview studies, according to which compounds enhancing
GABA-ergic conduction, agonists and modulators of GABAA
receptors, inhibitors of GABA transaminase, GABA reuptake
