Introduction

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and
represents a signiﬁcant public health burden (Kim and
Johnston, 2013). Ischemic stroke accounts for approximately
70–80% of all cases, and treatment options are limited. Brain
tissue is sensitive to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), and
arterial occlusion can result in neuronal death from the disruption of cerebral blood ﬂow following a complex sequence of
events. Both human and animal studies have shown that the
activation of the immune system plays an important role in the
pathophysiology of stroke (Macrez et al., 2011). Severe ischemia
triggers an inﬂammatory cascade and oxidative stress, inducing
the breakdown of the blood–brain barrier and resulting in the
inﬁltration of peripheral immune cells into brain tissue. During
the hyperacute and acute phases of ischemia, danger-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from damaged cells and
extracellular peroxiredoxin activate inﬁltrating macrophages,
leading to the release of inﬂammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-23 and IL-17
(Shichita et al., 2012a). Finally, injured resident brain cells and
impregnated leukocytes produce various inﬂammatory cytokines
and mediators that aggravated post-ischemic inﬂammation and
injury.
T lymphocytes can be detected in the infarction boundary
zones 24 h after reperfusion and play important roles in the
delayed phase of brain ischemia (Jander et al., 1995; Schroeter
et al., 1994). CD4þ helper T (Th) and CD8þ cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL) as well as γδT cells exacerbate neuronal
damage (Kleinschnitz et al., 2010; Shichita et al., 2009) by
releasing the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IL-1,–17, and -23
and TNF-α, whereas regulatory T (Treg) cells play a neuroprotective role following stroke through the secretion of antiinﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming
growth factor (TGF)-β (Jin et al., 2010; Liesz et al., 2009).
Moreover, activated cells in the central nervous system
(CNS) also produce pro-inﬂammatory mediators for the
recruitment of T cells (Lakhan et al., 2009).
The T cell cytokine IL-17 is closely associated with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a T cell-mediated CNS
inﬂammation model (Lakhan et al., 2009). IL-17 has been shown
to exacerbate neuronal injury induced by OGD in vitro in a dosedependent manner (Wang et al., 2009), and is more central to
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury than the cytokine interferon γ
(Shichita et al., 2009). IL-17 is produced by γδT and Th17 cells. The
γδT cells appear in the infarct boundary zones at early phase
after I/R, as the major source of IL-17 in acute phase of stroke.
The proportion of γδT cells in T lymphocytes is only 1–10% in
peripheral blood (Gelderblom et al., 2012). After a few days of T
lymphocyte inﬁltration, Th17 cells became the main source of
IL-17 (Swardfager et al., 2013). The production of IL-17 depends
on the stimulation by IL-23, which is released by macrophages
(Chen et al., 2006; Langrish et al., 2005). A greater resistance to I/R
injury is conferred by deﬁciency of IL-23 compared to IL-17 in
mouse models (Shichita et al., 2009); however, the regulation of
the CNS inﬂammatory response by both cytokines promotes the
progression of ischemia. Besides IL-23, TNF-α and IL-1 produced
by microglia can also stimulate IL-17 secretion by lymphocytes
even in the absence of T cell receptor stimulation (Sutton et al.,

2006). In contrast, IL-10 has been shown to ameliorate brain
damage induced by Treg cell depletion and prevent secondary
infarction (Liesz et al., 2009); thus, the activation of Treg cells can
be beneﬁcial for post-stroke rehabilitation.
The transplantation of pluripotent stem cells is a promising strategy for the treatment of stroke. Given the ethical
considerations, human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem
cells (hUC-MSCs) offer the best option for cell therapy, as they
can be obtained painlessly in abundance, express low levels
of human leukocyte antigen 1, have high immune tolerance,
and possess stemness properties (Chao et al., 2012). Our
previous study demonstrated that hUC-MSCs improved behavioral functions and histopathological injury in autoimmune
encephalomyelitis mice through the regulation of immunoinﬂammation and remyelination (Liu et al., 2013). Other studies
have demonstrated that hUC-MSCs transplantation can signiﬁcantly alleviate ischemic injury in a mouse model of
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by differentiating
into neurons and astrocytes, thereby enhancing plasticity
(Ding et al., 2007), and by secreting factors that promote
neuroprotection, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis (Hsieh
et al., 2013). Although the mechanisms underlying these
functions are not fully understood, some can be attributed
to anti-inﬂammatory effects (Wang et al., 2012, 2013). For
instance, transplantation of hUC-MSCs can ameliorate
acute lung injury by increasing the number of Treg cells
and balancing anti- and pro-inﬂammatory factors in an
endotoxin-mediated experimental model (Sun et al., 2011).
Treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage in rats using hUCMSCs also decreased leukocyte inﬁltration, microglial activation, ROS levels, and matrix metalloproteinase production
(Liao et al., 2009b). Based on these ﬁndings, the present
study tested the hypothesis that hUC-MSCs can mitigate
brain injury from ischemia through regulation of peripheral
immunoinﬂammation.

Results

2.1.

Reduction in stroke-induced brain injury by hUC-MSCs

To characterize the neurological effects of hUC-MSCs treatment, the NSS, measurement of brain water content, and
TTC staining were used to assess behavior, brain edema, and
infarct volume at 24 h, 72 h and 1w post-I/R, respectively. At
72 h and 1week post-I/R, neurological deﬁcit was improved
in hUC-MSCs-treated MCAO mice, compared to those (control) without hUC-MSCs treatment (72 h: 6.370.86 vs.
8.270.77; 1 w: 5.370.66 vs. 7.870.58; Po0.01) (Fig. 1(A)).
Brain water content and infarct volume were lower in
hUC-MSCs-treated MCAO group at 72 h post-IR, than that
in control group (Brain water content: 72 h: 80.971.86 vs.
85.271.219 (%), Po0.01; 1 w- 79.871.18 vs. 83.071.97 (%),

Po0.05; 1 w- 14.272.07 vs. 19.572.06 (%), Po0.01, respectively. Fig. 1(B) and (C)). These results suggested that hUCMSCs treatment could lead to an improvement in ischemic
brain injury.

2.2.
Alterations of levels of inﬂammatory factors by hUCMSCs treatment in serum
IL-1 and TNF-α participate in the ampliﬁcation and activation of
γδT and Th17, while IL-23 is required for sustaining IL-17
production by these cells. IL-10 is a major immune suppressant
and mediates neuroprotection. The effect of hUC-MSCs on
peripheral blood serum levels of these cytokines was determined
by ELISA at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 72 h and 1 week after I/R. The hUC-

MSCs decreased the levels of IL-1, TNF-α, IL-23 and IL-17 at 12 h,
24 h, and 72 h post-I/R compared to control group (Fig. 2(A)–(D)).
Levels of IL-10 were higher in the hUC-MSCs-treated MCAO group
compared to control group at 24 h (6.7470.61 vs. 3.0370.53,
Po0.01), 72 h (4.0370.54 vs. 2.4870.36, Po0.05), and 1 week
(3.5870.59 vs. 2.3170.47, Po0.05) (Fig. 2(E)). Thus, hUC-MSCs
reduced levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and increased
levels of anti-inﬂammatory cytokines in peripheral blood after
ischemia, respectively.

ELISA. Results are shown as mean7SE. *Po0.05 and **Po0.01 vs. sham; #Po0.05 and ##Po0.01 vs. MCAOþNS (n ¼8 per group)

2.3.
Reduction of inﬂammation in ischemic brain
by hUC-MSCs
To examine the levels of these cytokines of ischemic brain,
quantitative PCR was performed within 1 week after I/R.
Compared to shams, the expression of IL-1 and IL-23 peaked
at 12 h, and the level of TNF-α and IL-17 in ipsilateral brain
peaked at 24 h post-MCAO (Fig. 3 However, hUC-MSCs mitigated this effect compared to control, reducing folds change
in transcript levels at 12 h, 24 h and 72 h postMCAO (Fig. 3A‐E). It suggested that hUC-MSCs reversed

neuroinﬂammation resulting from I/R injury by suppressing
the production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and enhancing
the expression of anti-inﬂammatory factor.

γδT and Th17 are both the major sources of IL-17 after
ischemia, the presence of these cells in the peripheral
immunology system (spleen, blood and lymph node) was

and (E) IL-10 in the cortex were measured 6, 12, 24, and 72 h and 1 week after I/R by quantitative PCR. Results are shown as
mean7SE. nPo0.05 and nnPo0.01 vs. shamþMSCs; #Po0.05 and ##Po0.01 vs. MCAOþNS (n¼ 8 per group).
mention, our results showed very low frequencies of γδT cells
in spleen (  4%), and lymph node ( 1%). Moreover, there was
only  0.5% and 0.1% proportion of IL-17þ in γδT cells been
detected in spleen and lymph node, respectively (data not
shown). As Fig. 4 shows, the numbers of Th17 cells were
increased in MCAO groups at 24 h (spleen: 4.1970.19 vs.
170.11, Po0.01; blood: 2.0570.15 vs. 170.08, Po0.01; lymph
node: 2.0470.14 vs. 170.08, Po0.05. Fig. 4A-D). The hUCMSCs reduced these cells compared to control at 24 h (spleen:
3.22 70.26 vs. 4.1970.19, Po0.05; blood: 0.8370.18 vs.
2.0570.15, Po0.01; lymph node: 0.8270.18 vs. 2.0470.14,

Po0.05. Fig. 4A-D). Thus, hUC-MSCs suppressed populations
of T cells which is responsible for the release of proinﬂammatory factors.
Treg cells have an anti-inﬂammatory, neuroprotective role
following MCAO. To determine whether hUC-MSCs can modulate population of Treg, the number of Treg cells in the
spleen, blood and lymph node was assessed by ﬂow cytometry at 24 h, 72 h post-I/R. As shown in Fig. 5A-D, the presence
of hUC-MSCs signiﬁcantly increased these numbers compared to control at 72 h post-MCAO (spleen: 1.9970.12 vs.
0.8770.08, Po0.01; blood: 1.7970.11 vs. 0.9070.07, Po0.01;

blood to lymph node are shown. The Th17 cell fraction in (B) spleen, (C) blood and (D) lymph node was quantiﬁed. Results are

lymph node: 1.0870.04 vs. 0.7470.13, Po0.05). These results
indicated that hUC-MSCs could enhance T cells involved in
neuroprotection following ischemia.

2.5.
hUC-MSCs modulating peripheral
immunoinﬂammation by TGF-β
TGF-β participated in the process of which Naïve CD4þ Tcells
develop into Th17 and Treg (Hemdan et al., 2012; Josefowicz
et al., 2012; Kunzmann et al., 2009). We proposed that hUCMSCs modulate the peripheral immune response through the
effect of TGF-β, so the serum levels of TGF-β were measured
at 24 h, 72 h, and 1week post-MCAO. Although I/R had no
effect on TGF-β levels, total TGF-β level was elevated in hUCMSCs-injected MCAO animals, reaching a peak at 24 h (80%
higher than NS-injected MCAO animals; Po0.01), and gradually decreasing thereafter (Fig. 6).

To further conﬁrm whether hUC-MSCs could upregulate
TGF-β, TGF-β neutralizing antibody (eBioscience, #16-9243) was
used. The results showed that the TGF-β antibody, at partially,
block the effect of hUC-MSCs signiﬁcantly increased the
number of Th17 cells at 24 h and decreased Treg cells at 72 h
post-I/R, compared to the hUC-MSCs-treated MCAO mice
(hUC-MSCsþTGF-β vs hUC-MSCs: Th17: blood: 0.92570.058

mouse-derived TGF-βis 99%, these results indicated that hUCMSCs may increase the level of TGF-β not only through
autocrine but also regulating endogenous secretion, to modulate the peripheral immunoinﬂammation.

3.

Discussion

Many studies indicate that hUC-MSCs treatment can promote
functional recovery and reduce infarction in animal models
of MCAO (Ding et al., 2007; Hsieh et al., 2013; Liao et al.,
2009a). This was supported by the results of the present
study, in which hUC-MSCs were administrated by intravenous tail injection within 30 min after I/R. The observed

reduction in infarct size and brain edema, accompanied by
an improvement in neurological outcome suggests that the
beneﬁcial effects of hUC-MSCs after stroke are not limited to
their proliferative capacity and multilineage differentiation
potential (Fig. 1). The immunomodulation effect of hUC-MSCs
was evidenced by the down-regulation of the proinﬂammatory cytokines IL-1, -17, -23 and TNF-α and concomitant up-regulation of production of the antiinﬂammatory factor IL-10 in peripheral blood serum and
ischemia hemisphere (Figs. 2 and 3). The populations of
IL-17-releasing T cells (Th17) in spleen, blood and lymph
node were correspondingly reduced at 24 h post-MCAO, while
the number of IL-10-producing Treg cells was increased at
72 h post-MCAO by hUC-MSCs treatment (Figs. 4 and 5).

300

brain research 1594 (2015) 293–304

Fig. 6 – hUC-MSCs increased serum levels of TGF-β in MCAO
mice. Levels of human/mouse-derived TGF-β were
measured by ELISA at 24 h, 72 h and 1 week after I/R. Results
are shown as mean7SE. nPo0.05 and nnPo0.01 (n ¼8 per
group).
Moreover, hUC-MSCs could enhanced the level of TGF-β
through autocrine and modulating endogenous secretion
(Figs. 6 and 7). Taken together, these ﬁndings demonstrate
that hUC-MSCs can attenuate or reverse ischemia-induced
brain injury by regulating the peripheral immunoinﬂammatory response.
Experimental induction of stroke produces a core of dead
neurons, but also causes apoptosis of damaged but partially
functional neurons in the ischemic penumbra (Sairanen et al.,
2006). The fate of these neurons is inﬂuenced by post-ischemic
inﬂammation, speciﬁcally by the balance between pro- and antiinﬂammatory cytokines (Shichita et al., 2012b). IL-17, which is
upregulated under ischemia, acts on receptors in astrocytes,
microglia, and neurons (Wang et al., 2009), the latter leading to
the activation of multiple second messenger systems such as
those involving nuclear factor (NF)-κB and glycogen synthase
kinase 3β, which has been shown to mediate neuronal apoptosis
(Hetman et al., 2000; Zepp et al., 2011). NF-κB is implicated in
microglia activation, which leads to the secretion of proinﬂammatory factors and adhesion molecules that exacerbate
parenchymal inﬂammation in the delayed phase of ischemia
(Zepp et al., 2011). Thus, suppressing the secretion of IL-17 is
presumed to constitute an effective therapeutic strategy. The
present results showed that compared to control, IL-17 levels in
the serum and ipsilateral brain of hUC-MSCs-treated MCAO mice
were downregulated, corresponding to the smaller numbers of
Th17 cells in the spleen, peripheral blood and lymph node as
determined by ﬂow cytometry. The release of IL-17 and differentiation of Th17 from naïve T cells can also be stimulated by
TNF-α and IL-1 (Weaver et al., 2007). Expression of these
cytokines is detected within 1 h of ischemia, and both are known
to directly induce neuronal apoptosis; in addition, IL-1 enhances
chemokine expression in microglia and astrocytes while TNF-α
attracts inﬁltrating leukocytes (Shichita et al., 2012b). In this
study, the expression of IL-1 and TNF-α was detected in the
serum and brain within 1 week after ischemia, which was
downregulated in the delayed phase in the presence of hUCMSCs, corresponding to the time period during which reduced

brain edema and infarct volume were observed in the treatment
group. Thus, the present results are consistent with previous
studies demonstrating that suppression of IL-1 and TNF-α can
reduce brain injury resulting from ischemia.
During the ﬁrst 24 h after stroke, DAMPs activate toll-like
receptors on microglia, promoting the release of inﬂammatory
cytokines, chemokines, and nitric oxide, leading to the activation
of the vascular endothelium and production of additional
inﬂammatory factors that result in the entry of peripheral
leukocytes into the parenchyma. After this initial response,
invading macrophages are activated by DAMPs and release
IL-23, while hypoxia inducible factor 1α induces the production
of IL-23 by astrocytes, thereby activating microglia; subsequently, microglia and encephalitogenic γδT cells release IL-17
(Swardfager et al., 2013). Thus, IL-23 regulates IL-17 production,
and suppressing IL-23 decreases IL-17 levels, leading to a better
post-ischemic outcome; the reduced IL-23 expression in the
treatment group (Figs. 2 and 3) can therefore partly account for
the alleviation of I/R-induced neurological injury by hUC-MSCs.
IL-10 is an immune suppressant and mediates neuroprotection (Singh et al., 2013); The overexpression of IL-10 had an
anti-apoptotic effect in hippocampal neurons (Ooboshi et al.,
2005). Here, it was observed that the level of IL-10, as well as
the number of IL-10-producing Treg cells, was increased by
hUC-MSCs treatment (Figs. 2, 3, 5). Thus, in addition to
suppressing pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, hUC-MSCs concomitantly stimulate anti-inﬂammatory factors that protect the
brain from post-ischemic injury.
TGF-β is a major regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation in many tissues, and is produced by various cell types
including human amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal
stem cells, Treg and macrophages (Kang et al., 2012). It has been
shown to mediate differentiation of Treg and Th17 cells in vitro
and in vivo in a context-dependent manner (Chen et al., 2003;
Kretschmer et al., 2005; Mucida et al., 2005). In the presence of IL2, TGF-β regulates Treg cell development, possibly via stimulation of Foxp3 expression (Chen et al., 2003; Josefowicz et al., 2012),
while in cooperation with IL-1, -6, and -23 and TNF-α, Th17 cells
are promoted (Bettelli et al., 2006; Hemdan et al., 2012; Laurence
et al., 2007; Manel et al., 2008; Veldhoen et al., 2006; Zuniga et al.,
2013), in part through induction of IL-23 receptor expression
(O'Shea et al., 2009). Signiﬁcantly, this study found that the total
levels of TGF-β were enhanced by hUC-MSCs through autocrine
and modulating endogenous secretion of mice (Figs. 6 and 7).
Taken together, we conclude that hUC-MSCs regulate peripheral
immune by shifting the Th17/Treg differentiation from Naïve
CD4þ T cells through modulating the production of TGF-β.
Moreover, because the development of Treg cells is stimulated
by a high concentration of TGF-β and TGF-β is released by Treg
cells, the differentiation of Treg cells and TGF-β production
constitute a positive feedback loop that is further ampliﬁed by
the suppression of γδT cells by Treg cells (Kunzmann et al., 2009).
That is, the suppression effect of Treg strengthened the modulation of hUC-MSCs on peripheral immune response.

Experimental procedures

5.1.

Experimental animals

6–7-week-old male mice weighting 25–30 g were provided by
the Drum Tower Hospital Animal Center, protocols were

approved by the Committee of Experimental Animal Administration of Nanjing University.

5.2.

Preparation of focal cerebral ischemia model

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) as previously described (Xu et al., 2006).
Brieﬂy, All mice were anaesthetized with Sodium Pentobarbital
(1%) by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 45 mg/kg. A middle
cervical incision was made under a dissecting microscope and
then the right common carotid artery and extental carotid artey
were isolated. A poly- L-lysine coated nylon monoﬁlament

302

brain research 1594 (2015) 293–304

thread (3/0gauge with the tip heat blunted to a diameter of
0.104 mm) was inserted through the external carotid artery and
advanced into the internal carotid artery to occlude the origin of
the middle cerebral artery (approximately 12 mm). Body and
head temperatures were controlled at 3770.5 1C with a homeothermic blanket and water pads. After 90 min of occlusion, the
ﬁlament was withdrawn for reperfusion. Sham-treated mice
were subjected to the same procedure without MCAO.

5.3.

Preparation and transplantation of hUC-MSCs

hUC-MSCs were supplied by Shenzhen Beike Stem cell Engineering Institute as previous described (Liu et al., 2013). The
passages 2–3 of hUC-MSCs for this study were used and a single
injection of 4  106 ml in 0.5 ml normal saline (NS) or same
volume of NS (control group) via the tail vein was operated
within 30 min after I/R. For block study, the TGF-β neutralizing
antibody (eBioscience, #16-9243) were used though i.p. injection
at a dose of 1 mg/kg (Anscher et al., 2006), 20 min before hUCMSCs treatment (n¼5 per group).

5.4.
Measurement of behavior, brain edema and infarct
volume
5.4.1.

Behavior test

The Neurological Severity Scores (NSS), including of motor,
sensory, reﬂex and balance tests, were used to evaluated the
neurological function of the mice at 24 h, 72 h and 1w after
MCAO (n¼10 per group), as previously described (Chen et al.,
2010). Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0–18: 1–6,
mild injury; 7–12, moderate injury; 13–18, severe injury. One
point was awarded for the inability to perform the tasks or for
the lack of a tested reﬂex.

5.4.2.

Brain edema test

At 24 h, 72 h and 1w after MCAO, the brains were quickly
removed, the wet weight (wW) of the ischemia hemisphere
were weighted using an electronic analytic balance. Then, dry
weight (dW) was obtained after 24 h drying the tissue in the
100 1C incubator. The brain water content was calculate
according the formula: brain water content (%)¼(wWdW)/
wW  100%, n ¼10 per group.

5.4.3.

5.6.

ELISA assays for cytokines

Mouse cytokine ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA) were used to detect levels of IL-1 (MLB00C), IL-10
(M1000), IL-17 (M1700), IL-23 (M2300), and TNF-α (MTA00) in
serum of all groups (n¼ 8 per group), as previously described
(Liu et al., 2013). For the detection of total TGF-β in serum,
because of 99% homology between human and murine
proteins, human/mouse TGF-β ELISA kit were employed
(eBioscience, 88-8350), n¼ 8 per group. Brieﬂy speaking,
100 μl of samples or standards were added to each well of
96-well plates coated with anti-mouse cytokines antibody.
The plates were incubated at 37 1C for 90 min and then
washed 5 times. 100 μl of biotinylated cytokine speciﬁc antibody was added into each well and incubated at 37 1C for
60 min. Plates were then washed, treated with 100 μl of
diluted streptavidin-HRP and incubated at 37 1C for 30 min.
After washing, the color was produced by addition of 100 μL
substrate solution for 10–15 min. Finally, 100 μL of stop solution was added to terminate reaction. Optical density was
measured at 450 nm within 10 min (Liu et al., 2013).

Infarct volume measurement

The brains were removed and sectioned into 5 slices (2 mm
thickness) at 24 h, 72 h1, 1week post-MCAO. Infarct volumes
were measured by staining with 2,3,5-triphenyterazoliumchloride (TTC), as previously described (Niu et al., 2012).
Brieﬂy speaking, slices were photographed with a computercontrolled digital camera (Olympus, DP70) and infarct size
was evaluated by Image-Pro Plus (IPP 6.0). To eliminate the
effect of brain swelling, the result of infarct volume was
shown as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere
(Niu et al., 2012), n ¼10 per group.

respectively. For Th17 analysis, samples were stained with a
combination of the following mAbs (eBiosciences): CD3-APC
(17-0031), CD4-FITC (11-0041); And then cells were stimulated
with 25 μg/ml PMA(Sigma), 1 μg/ml lonomycin, 10 μg/ml BFA
(ALEXIS), and incubated at 37 1C and 5% CO2 for 4 h. After
stimulation, ﬂuorescently labeled anti-mouse monoclonal
antibodies IL-17-PE (eBiosciences, 12-7471) were used for
FACS assay. For CD4þCD25þ regulatory T cells (Tregs) analysis, samples were stained with mouse regulatory T cell
staining kit (eBioscience, Cat. NO.88-8111). Brieﬂy speaking,
cells were surface stained with anti-mouse CD4-FITC (RM4-5)
and anti-mouse CD25-APC (PC61.5), then ﬁxed and permeabilized using the Foxp3 staining buffers and subsequently
stained with anti-mouse Foxp3-PE (FJK-16s). Identiﬁcation of
T lymphocytes phenotyping was performed by three-color
ﬂow cytometry on a FACSCantoTM machine using BD FACS
Dvia Software (BD Biosciences). In each experiment, cells
were stained with isotype control Ab to establish background
staining and to set quadrants before calculating the percentage of positive cells (Liu et al., 2013).

5.7.

Real-time PCR

Real-time PCR was performed as described previously (Liu
et al., 2013). Total RNA was extracted by using the Trizol
reagent (Takara) and was reverse-transcribed into cDNA
using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara) for Quantitative
PCR (ABI 7500, USA) in the presence of a ﬂuorescent dye
(SYBR Green I; Takara), n ¼8 per group. The relative abundance of mRNA was calculated after normalization to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ribosomal RNA.
The primers (Invitrogen, USA) were as follows:

Flow cytometry assays

Peripheral immunology system (spleens, peripheral blood
and lymph nodes) was removed at 24 h, 72 h post-MCAO
(n ¼8 per group), and single-cell suspensions were obtained

Statistical analysis

Data was retrieved and processed using the Microcal Origin
8.0 software program. The group data was expressed as the
mean7standard error. Dependent variables (NSS and infarction volume) were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with condition (time after I/R). Dependent variables (levels of
various inﬂammation factors and T lymphocytes) were analyzed using two-way ANOVAs with the Bonferroni's post-hoc
comparisons as the between-subjects factor. The statistical
analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 software. A probability of Po0.05 was considered to be signiﬁcant.
