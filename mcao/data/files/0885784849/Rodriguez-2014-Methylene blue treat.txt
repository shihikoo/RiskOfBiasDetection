Introduction

Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the leading
cause of disability in the world (World Health Organization,
2011). Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA)
remains the only approved ischemic stroke therapy available
to the masses. Moreover, rt-PA treatment only reaches less
than 5% of patients due to its narrow therapeutic window and
its risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage. There is an urgent

need for new neuroprotective therapies that can extend the
thrombolytic therapeutic window.
Methylene blue (MB) is a grandfathered FDA drug that was
ﬁrst synthesized at the end of the 19th century and has been
used to treat methemoglobinemia and cyanide poisoning.
Low-dose MB has an excellent safety proﬁle. MB has redox
recycling properties in that it acts as an electron cycler and
facilitates electron transfer in the mitochondrial electron
transport chain from NADH to cytochrome c with resultant

effect of ATP production. By rerouting electrons directly to
cytochrome c, and bypassing complexes I–III, MB also minimizes oxygen free radical production in the mitochondrial
electron transport chain, especially under oxidative stress
conditions. The energy-enhancing and antioxidant properties
of MB could have potential neuroprotective effects.
Recently, low dose MB has been shown to exhibit therapeutic effects in a number of neurological disorders. MB reduces
neurobehavioral impairment in optic neuropathy (Rojas et al.,
2009; Zhang et al., 2006), Parkinson’s disease (Rojas et al., 2012)
and Alzheimer’s disease (Congdon et al., 2012; O’Leary et al.,
2010) in animal models. Clinical studies have shown that MB
can slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (Wischik and
Staff, 2009; Wischik et al., 2008). MB was also shown to have
neuroprotective effect in transient ischemic stroke models
(Shen et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2011) and in a traumatic brain
injury model in rats (Watts et al., 2014).
Magnetic resonance imaging offers a non-invasive means to
track the progression of ischemic brain injury in a longitudinal
fashion. T2-weighted MRI is widely used to visualize edema
and deﬁne ﬁnal infarct volume (Shen et al., 2005). Perfusionweighted MRI can measure cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) at the
tissue level, allowing for the detection of tissue with reduced
perfusion that is at risk of ischemic brain injury. Diffusionweighted MRI (DWI), which measures water motion, is very
sensitive to early ischemic brain injury in contrast to computed
tomography and T2 MRI (Moseley et al., 1990). As such DWI has
become the method of choice for early detection of ischemic
brain injury. Although the underlying biophysical mechanisms
of DWI signal contrast is not fully understood (Duong et al.,
1998), the combined use of perfusion and diffusion MRI are
now widely used to distinguish reversible from irreversibly
ischemic brain injury, and to guide acute stroke treatment in
preclinical and clinical settings (Astrup et al., 1981; Schlaug
et al., 1999).
The goals of the current study were: (i) to test the hypothesis
that methylene blue treatment delays progression of perfusion–
diffusion mismatch to infarct in permanent ischemic stroke in
rats, and (ii) to evaluate the effects of two treatment doses. A
randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled design was
used to avoid bias. MRI was used to verify the presence of

145

mismatch at the hyperacute phase, to exclude incomplete
occlusion, and ensure similar initial lesion sizes between the
two groups before treatment. Such subject selection, which has
been demonstrated to be critical in clinical stroke treatment
trials, would not have been possible with terminal histological
measurements.

Physiological parameters and mortality rates

For all three (vehicle group, 1 and the 3 mg/kg MB) groups, the
baseline heart rate (350–450 bpm), arterial oxygen saturation
(94–96%), end tidal expiratory CO2 (35–45 mmHg) were within
normal physiological ranges and were not statistically different from each other, except for the arterial oxygen saturation
of the 3 mg/kg MB group which showed a transient and mild
reduction at the 60 min time point (from 94.9 to 91.0%,
p¼ 0.03) and returned to pre-MB value after the 90 min time
point. This was likely due to light absorption of MB, which
interfered with pulse oximetry. The mortality rates of the
vehicle, 1 and 3 mg/kg MB groups were 1 out of 12, 3 out of 12
and 2 out of 7 at 24 h after stroke, respectively.

Overview

Representative CBF maps at 30 min, ADC maps at 30 and
180 min, and T2 maps at 24 h are shown in Fig. 1 for the
vehicle, 1 and 3 mg/kg MB groups. At 30 min after MCAO,
abnormal CBF and ADC were detected and a perfusion and
diffusion mismatch was present. At 30 min after MCAO, the
ADC lesion volumes after MCAO were similar for all three
groups. At 180 min after MCAO, the ADC lesion volumes of
the vehicle group were larger than those of the MB treated
groups at 180 min. At 24 h after MCAO, T2 infarct volumes
were similar amongst the groups.

1 mg/kg Group

CBF deﬁned lesion volumes for the vehicle and 1 mg/kg group
ranged from 300 to 320 mm3, were not statistically different
from each other, and did not change across time (Fig. 2). At
30 min, the ADC lesion volumes of the vehicle and 1 mg/kg
MB group were not statistically different from each other and
both were statistically different (smaller, po0.05) from the
CBF lesion volumes. In the vehicle group, the ADC lesion
volume increased with time, predominantly within the ﬁrst
30 min. By contrast in the 1 mg/kg MB group, the ADC lesion
volume increased at a slower rate and was smaller than that
of the vehicle group at 180 min. A repeated measure ANOVA
for the 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min ADC lesion volume time
points for the 1 mg/kg group versus vehicle was 0.041. The
lesion volume of the 1 mg/kg group at 60, 90 and 120 min time
points were statistically different (p ¼0.009, 0.012, 0.018,
respectively) from the vehicle-treated animals.

2.2.3.

3 mg/kg group

CBF deﬁned lesion volumes for 3 mg/kg group at 30 min were
about 290–310 mm3 and were not statistically different from
the other groups (Fig. 3). At 30 min, the ADC lesion volume of
the 3 mg/kg MB group was not different from that of the
vehicle treated group at 30 min. The CBF ischemic volumes at
60, 90, 120 and 150 min for the 3 mg/kg MB were smaller than
those of the vehicle (p ¼0.01–0.03), indicative of increased CBF
in the 3 mg/kg MB group. Similar to 1 mg/kg, the administration of 3 mg/kg MB decreased the growth rate of the ADC
lesion volume over the following 30–180 min. The ADC lesion
volumes at 60, 90 and 120 min were smaller compared to the
control group (p¼ 0.034, 0.021, 0.047). A repeated measures
ANOVA analysis for the 3 mg/kg group yielded a p-value of
0.165 for the 60–180 min time points and a p-value of 0.047 for
only the 60, 90 and 120 min time points. Conversely, the
comparison of the ADC and CBF values (60–180 min) for the 1
and 3 mg/kg groups was not statistically different (p440.05).

2.3.

Mismatch evolutions

To further evaluate the MB treatment effects, we separately
analyzed the central and peripheral image slices to the lesion
(Fig. 4a) for the 1 mg/kg MB group. In the central slices, the

vehicle-treated animals demonstrated a rapid increase in
ADC lesion volume, reaching CBF lesion volume 60 min after
MCAO (Fig. 4b). However, the peripheral slices demonstrated
delayed growth of the ADC lesion and there was persistent
perfusion–diffusion mismatch at 180 min after MCAO
(Fig. 4c). By comparison, the 1 mg/kg MB group showed
decreased growth rate of the central and peripheral slices
and overall small ADC lesion volumes up to 180 min after
MCAO. The CBF volumes of the central and peripheral lesion
also decreased for MB treated animals. The central CBF
volumes for the 1 mg/kg MB versus vehicle groups at 60, 90,
and 120 min were not different. Similar results were obtained
from analysis of the 3 mg/kg MB group (data not shown).

2.4.

24 h T2 infarct volumes

The T2 infarct volumes at 24 h were 23779, 23578, and
22976 mm3, for vehicle, 1 and 3 mg/kg MB groups, respectively. They were not statistically different from each other as
expected.

3.

Discussion

We applied serial PWI, DWI and T2 MRI to test the hypothesis
that MB administration can prolong the perfusion–diffusion
mismatch. Our main ﬁndings are that: (i) MB signiﬁcantly
delays the progression of perfusion–diffusion mismatch into
infarct, (ii) MB mildly increases the CBF in the hypoperfused
tissue, (iii) MB does not change the ﬁnal infarct volume in
permanent ischemic stroke, and (iv) there are no dosedependent effects on mismatch progression for the 1 and
3 mg/kg doses studied.

Safety

Similar to prior studies, low dose MB was found to be safe in
rodents. The baseline heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation,
end tidal expiratory CO2 were within normal physiological
ranges for all three groups. Low-dose MB (1–5 mg/kg) also has
an excellent safety proﬁle in humans, with minimal side

effects and contraindications (Peter et al., 2000; Walter-Sack
et al., 2009). USP-grade MB is classiﬁed as a FDA-grandfathered
drug that has been used in humans for over 120 years. The very
few papers reporting negative effects can be readily explained.
For example, one study (Wei et al., 1994) showed that ‘topical’
administration of MB given at the concentration of 1 mM
inhibited guanylyl cyclase and thus reduces the second messenger cyclic GMP, but did not alter regional CBF and oxygen
consumption in focal cerebral ischemia. However, this was an
extremely high MB concentration (over 1000 times higher than
MB concentrations with beneﬁcial effects). MB has a hormetic
dose–response, with therapeutic effects at low dose and toxic
effects at high doses (Bruchey and Gonzalez-Lima, 2008;
Callaway et al., 2004). Daily 4 mg/kg oral MB has been used
safely for one year in clinical trials (Naylor et al., 1986; Wischik
et al., 2008; Wischik and Staff, 2009). MB at 1–3 mg/kg i.v.
infused over minutes is used safely as the treatment of choice
for methemoglobinemia poisoning in emergency rooms.

3.2.

MB metabolic and hemodynamic effects

There is evidence that MB has effects on metabolism in vitro,
and on hemodynamic and metabolism in vivo. Lin et al.
(2012) showed that low-dose MB increases the rate of cytochrome c activity when exposed to NADH in isolated rat brain
mitochondria, and increases cellular oxygen production and
quantitative cellular glucose uptake in HT-22 cells. Positron
emission tomography studies using ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (18FFDG) in rat demonstrated that MB increased neural glucose
uptake in vivo. MRI-based neuroimaging studies in normal
rats also showed that MB increased CBF, cerebral metabolic
rate of oxygen consumption under normoxic and hypoxic

conditions. Additional neuroimaging studies also demonstrated that low dose MB enhanced the blood oxygenation
level dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses elicited by forepaw
stimulation (Huang et al., 2013).

3.3.

MB delays mismatch progression

Low-dose MB administration delays perfusion–diffusion mismatch progression to infarction. The effect is more apparent in
the peripheral slices compared to central slices (Fig. 4b and c),
consistent with the notion that peripheral slices have more
tissue at risk. A possible explanation is that MB enhances
cytochrome c activity and sustains mitochondrial ATP production as well as prevents oxygen free radicals formation as
described above.
Another potential mechanism behind the in vivo neuroprotective effect of MB may be related to an increase in perfusion.
Our data showed that MB at 3 mg/kg transiently increased CBF
in the hypoperfused tissue in the hyperacute phase. Lin et al.
(2012) also reported similar effects under normoxia and
hypoxia in normal animals. The 1 mg/kg MB administration
also produced a mild increase in CBF that approached, but did
not reach statistical signiﬁcance (p¼0.07).

3.4.

Comparison with previous studies

Our results are consistent with two previous studies of MB
treatment on transient ischemic stroke in rats (Shen et al.,
2013; Wen et al., 2011). Wen et al. showed by histology that
low dose MB given at 60 min after MCAO in a rat transient
(60 min) MCA occlusion model decreased infarct volume at
24 h. The novelty of our study is that MRI was used to

148

brain research 1588 (2014) 144–149

longitudinally demonstrate that MB delayed the progression
of the perfusion–diffusion mismatch infarct, which would not
have been possible with terminal histological methods.
Shen et al. used neuroimaging in a 60 min rat MCA occlusion
model to study MB. A pixel-by-pixel approached was used to
assess the effects of MB on the mismatch tissue. MB was able to
salvage more core pixels and mismatch pixels than vehicle
treated animals, resulting in  30% reduction of infarct volume
at 2 days after stroke in the MB group compared to vehicle group.
The novelty of our work includes testing the efﬁcacy of MB in
permanent ischemia where MB administration delayed perfusion–diffusion mismatch progression to infarction This is clinically relevant because MB may be used to delay the evolution of
infarct prior to chemical or mechanical thrombectomy.

3.5.

Dose dependence

We also tested whether a higher dose MB can increase the
efﬁcacy of the drug in ischemic stroke. We were surprised to
ﬁnd that 3 mg/kg MB did not improve efﬁcacy compared to
1 mg/kg. This may be due to the hormetic dose response curve
of methylene blue which is relatively ﬂat over the therapeutic
dose ranges (Fig. 3 in Bruchey and Gonzalez-Lima, 2008). Future
studies will aim at studying the efﬁcacy of multiple MB doses
to improve functional outcome in chronic stroke.

4.

Conclusion

The use of low dose (1 and 3 mg/kg) methylene blue delays the
growth rate of the perfusion–diffusion mismatch into infarction, thereby extending the treatment window. This neuroprotective effect is likely the result of sustained ATP production
and increased CBF to tissue at risk. Since low dose methylene
blue has a good safety proﬁle in humans, this preclinical work
could expedite its transition into clinical trials.

Experimental procedures

5.1.

Animal preparation

All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Texas
Health Science Center. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–350 g,
n¼41) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Fourteen animals were allocated to vehicle,
sixteen animals to 1 mg/kg MB, and eleven animals to 3 mg/
kg MB. Permanent focal cerebral ischemia of the middle
cerebral artery was performed using 0.35–0.37 mm intraluminal
silicon rubber-coated ﬁlaments (Doccol Corporation, Sharon,
MA) under 2% isoﬂurane. Animals were mechanically ventilated and maintained at 1.2–1.5% isoﬂurane in air while in the
MRI scanner. A MouseOx system (Starr Life Sciences) was used
to monitor heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation and breathing
rate. A rectal probe sensor in conjunction with a water bath
feedback loop was used to maintain the temperature within
3770.5 1C. End-tidal CO2 was monitored using a SurgiVet V9004
Capnographer (Smiths Medical, Waukesha, WI). All

physiological measurements were recorded and maintained
within normal range throughout the experiment.

5.2.

Experimental procedures

A pre-determined randomized scheme was used to allocate the
type of intervention prior to MCA occlusion surgery. The
surgeon and data analyst were blinded to the type of intervention. Either vehicle (heparinized normal saline), 1 or 3 mg/kg
USP methylene blue (10 mg/kg bottle, American Regent, Shirley,
NY; diluted in heparinized normal saline) was infused through
the tail vein over 30 min after initial baseline scan (at 30 min)
using an MRI compatible pump (Harvard Apparatus). Half-dose
(0.5 or 1.5 mg/kg) was administered after the last 180 min time
point over 30 min. Standard behavioral tests were not obtained
due to anticipated animal inactivity and very poor health
associated with a permanent stroke model resulting in
decreased sensitivity of these tests. Animals were excluded if
the initial lesion volume at 30 min was less than 40 mm3 or
greater than 300 mm3. This inclusion window minimized selection of lesions with poor occlusion or insufﬁcient mismatch.
Animals were also excluded if the perfusion imaging demonstrated baseline or delayed poor occlusion. Five animals were
excluded due to initial lesion volume not meeting size criteria
and two were excluded due to poor occlusion. Two additional
animals were excluded due to abnormal physiology and
another animal was excluded due to incomplete MRI data.

5.3.

MRI experiments

MRI studies were conducted on a Bruker Biospec 7 T/40 cm
scanner with a 76 G/cm BGA12S gradient insert (Billerica, MA)
using custom made brain imaging and single loop perfusion
neck coils. The apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) was measured using spin-echo diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging
and two b values of 4 and 1200 s/mm2, and TE¼30 ms (Shen
et al., 2005). The cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) was measured using
continuous arterial spin labeling with a 2.7-s square radiofrequency pulse applied to the labeling coil followed by a
250 ms post-labeling delay and TE¼ 10.2 ms. T2 maps were
acquired using fast spin echo with four effective echo times (25,
40, 75 and 120 ms), echo train length 4, and 8 signal averages.
The common parameters for these three sequences were:
seven 1.5 mm thick slices, single shot, TR¼ 3 s, matrix¼96  96
(reconstructed to 128  128), ﬁeld of view¼ 25.6  25.6 mm, 901
ﬂip angle. ADC and CBF maps were acquired at 30, 60, 90, 120,
150, and 180 min post-occlusion and on day-1 (2472 h) and T2
maps were acquired on day-1 (2472 h).

5.4.

Data analysis

ADC and CBF measurements were collected every 30 min over
3 h after stroke to monitor the evolution of the ischemic
penumbra (Meng et al., 2004). The 60 min time point was
obtained immediately after termination of the drug infusion.
T2 map was calculated at day 1. Cerebral blood ﬂow measurements were used to estimate perfusion. In order to minimize
the subjectivity associated with independent ROI measurements, ADC region of interest regions were drawn in each
contralateral normal hemisphere including cortex and striatum

brain research 1588 (2014) 144–149

to correct for possible ﬂuctuation in ADC signal. An upper limit
signal threshold for infarcted ADC values was calculated from
the mean normal hemisphere ADC signal minus three times
the standard deviation of the non-infarcted tissue. Regions that
met this 99.7% difference signal threshold in the contralateral
(normal) hemisphere were not included in the infarct lesion
volume measurements and were considered artifact. A threshold for abnormal CBF values was calculated from the mean
normal hemisphere CBF signal minus one times the standard
deviation of the non-infarcted hemisphere to be able to detect
subtle changes in PWI volume. Final infarct volume was
deﬁned using T2 maps at day 1 (2472 h) using threshold of
the mean T2 signal value of the normal hemisphere plus two
times the standard deviation. Edema-corrected infarct volume
was calculated as infarct volume – (right hemisphere volume –
left hemisphere volume).

5.5.

Statistical analysis

Lesions volumes are presented as mean7standard error of
mean. ANOVA with repeated measures correction was used
to evaluate global differences in lesion volumes across
different 60–180 min time points. The Student’s t-test was
used to test the null hypothesis that the saline group mean
lesion volume is not greater than the MB treated lesion
volume for the individual time points. Statistical and data
analysis was conducted in MedCalc 12.7.0 (MedCalc Software,
Ostend, Belgium) and Stimulate 8.0.1 (University of Minnesota). Values were expressed as means7S.E.M. A po0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
