Sex differences are well known in cerebral ischemia and may impact the effect of stroke treatments. In male rats, the MEK1/2
inhibitor U0126 reduces ischemia-induced endothelin type B (ETB) receptor upregulation, infarct size and improves acute
neurologic function after experimental stroke. However, responses to this treatment in females and long-term effects on outcome
are not known. Initial experiments used in vitro organ culture of cerebral arteries, conﬁrming ERK1/2 activation and increased ETB
receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in female cerebral arteries. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO, 120 minutes)
was induced in female Wistar rats, with U0126 (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or vehicle administered at 0 and 24 hours of reperfusion,
or with no treatment. Infarct volumes were determined and neurologic function was assessed by 6-point and 28-point neuroscores.
ETB receptor-mediated contraction was studied with myograph and protein expression with immunohistochemistry. In vitro organ
culture and tMCAO resulted in vascular ETB receptor upregulation and activation of ERK1/2 that was prevented by U0126. Although
no effect on infarct size, U0126 improved the long-term neurologic function after experimental stroke in female rats. In conclusion,
early prevention of the ERK1/2 activation and ETB receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in the cerebral vasculature after ischemic
stroke in female rats improves the long-term neurologic outcome.

INTRODUCTION
Sex differences exist in occurrence, outcome, and treatment of
cerebral ischemia.1,2 Throughout much of the lifespan there is a
higher incidence of stroke in men than in women. Sex differences
also exist in the response to stroke therapy, showed by greater
beneﬁt and neurologic improvement after tissue plasminogen
activator treatment in women compared with men.3,4 Furthermore, sex-speciﬁc responses have been reported for aspirin
therapy in stroke patients.5,6
We have shown that vasoconstrictor endothelin type B (ETB)
receptors are upregulated in smooth muscle cells of cerebral
arteries after stroke in human7 and rat.8,9 Increased expression and
contractile responses of ETB receptors are hypothesized to reduce
cerebral blood ﬂow further after an ischemic stroke and
exacerbate tissue damage.10 Upregulation of ETB receptors was
observed in arteries placed in organ culture, and this has become
an established in vitro method for studying underlying mechanisms of receptor upregulation.11 Previous studies in male rats
showed that upregulation of ETB and other vasoconstrictor
receptors occurs via the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway in both stroke
and organ culture models.10 This ﬁnding led us to examine the
MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 which, not only attenuates vascular
receptor upregulation, but also reduces infarct size and improves
neurologic function when administered after experimental
stroke.12,13 The previous data suggest a promising therapeutic

lead for stroke treatment, but it is not known whether similar
pathways contribute to the effects of stroke in females. Therefore,
we aim to investigate whether (1) vascular ETB receptor upregulation occurs in female cerebral arteries after transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and organ culture, (2) the
receptor upregulation is mediated via the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway,
and (3) treatment with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 suppresses ETB
receptor upregulation and improves long-term neurologic outcome after ischemic stroke in female rats.

(100 mg/L), and amphotericin B (0.25 mg/L) at 37°C in humidiﬁed 5%
CO2 in air. Before incubation, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (LC Laboratories,
Boston, MA, USA) 10 μmol/L, or equal volume of DMSO was added. For
western blot, arteries from the Circle of Willis (tissue from two animals were
pooled) were incubated as described above except for 6 hours of organ
culture. In total n = 39 animals were used for the in vitro studies (see ﬁgure
legends for exact number of animals per group and experiment).

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Twelve-week-old female Wistar rats (250 to 265 g) were subjected to
intraluminal MCA occlusion.13 Before surgeries, the estrous cycle was
monitored (daily collection of vaginal smears and characterization of the
types of cells14 present for three consecutive cycles, see Supplementary
Information) and only female rats that were under low inﬂuence of estrogen,
i.e. not in proestrus, at the day of surgery, were selected to minimize
possible effects from hormonal ﬂuctuation. Animals were anesthetized by
4.5% isoﬂurane in N2O:O2 (70:30) and kept anesthetized by 1% to 1.5%
isoﬂurane in N2O/O2 through inhalation. Physiologic parameters were
measured immediately before the occlusion (Supplementary Tables S1 and
S2 in the Supplementary Information). Animals were occluded for 2 hours
followed by reperfusion, and killed 2 or 14 days later. Average Laser-Doppler
ﬂow reductions of cerebral blood ﬂow were as follows: 70 ± 3% in untreated,
77 ± 3% in vehicle, and 76 ± 2% in U0126 animals (lower inclusion limit 58%).
One of the U0126-treated rats died between 24 and 48 hours after tMCAO.
N = 32 animals were included in the in vivo experiments (see ﬁgure legends
for exact number of animals per group and experiment).

U0126 Treatment
Study I (Figure 1) contains three experimental groups: untreated, U0126,
and vehicle (DMSO), and rats were terminated at 48 hours of reperfusion.
Animals treated with vehicle conﬁrmed earlier studies showing that DMSO
alone has no effect on the parameters studied. The MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126
(30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was injected at 0 and 24 hours of reperfusion
after tMCAO based on the previous evaluation of the drug in male rats.13
Animals in study II (Figure 1) were administered U0126 or vehicle as
described above and were killed 14 days after tMCAO. Experimental group
assignments were randomized and blinded to the surgical experimenter.

Neurologic Examination
Neurologic examination was performed at 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14 days after
tMCAO according to established 6-point15,16 and 28-point17 scoring
systems by a blinded and experienced rater. Scoring was determined on
a scale starting from 0 for severe impairment to the maximum score point
for healthy function in the 28-point neuroscore. The 6-point neuroscore is
graded in six levels from 0—no visible defects to 5—death.

Infarct Size Measurement
Brains were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned into 40 μm
coronal sections using a microtome (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany),
collected at 1 mm intervals and immunostained with neuron-speciﬁc
nuclear protein NeuN (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, diluted to 1:1,000).
Images were analyzed in a blinded manner using the ImageJ software
(http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) and infarct volumes were calculated by an
indirect method of subtracting the nonlesioned volume of the ipsilateral
hemisphere from the nonlesioned volume of the contralateral hemisphere.18 The resulting values were analyzed with Grubb’s test and one
outlier was removed.

In vitro Pharmacology
Contractile responses were examined in a Mulvany-Halpern wire
myograph (Danish Myo Technology A/S, Aarhus, Denmark) as described
previously.19,20 The contraction induced by K+ (63.5 mmol/L) was used as a
reference for contractile capacity and set to 100%. Endothelial inﬂuences
were blocked by L-NG-Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 μmol/L)
and indomethacin (10 μmol/L). Concentration–response curves were
obtained by cumulative application of sarafotoxin 6c (S6c, ETB receptor
agonist, 10 − 11 to 10 − 7 mol/L) and ET-1 (ETA and ETB receptor agonist,
10 − 11 to 10 − 7 mol/L). Before application of ET-1, ETB receptors were
inhibited by BQ788 (1 μmol/L), or by desensitization with S6c. The
maximum contraction elicited by an agonist is represented by EMAX, and
pEC50 represents the negative logarithm of the agonist concentration that
produced half the maximum response.
If not stated otherwise, the substances were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). ET-1 and S6c (Alexis Biochemicals, Farmingdale, NY, USA) were dissolved in 5% acetic acid and 0.1% bovine serum
albumin in distilled water. L-NAME hydrochloride, indomethacin, and
BQ788 were dissolved in bicarbonate buffer solution, ethanol, and DMSO,
respectively.

Immunohistochemistry
Isolated MCAs were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by rinsing in
sucrose containing phosphate buffers. Cryosections (10 μm) were permeabilized in PBST and then exposed overnight to primary antibody: sheep
anti-rat ETB 1:100 (#ALX-210-506A, Enzo, Lausen, Switzerland) or mouse
anti-rat dually phosphorylated ERK1/2 1:200 (#ab50011, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Secondary antibodies Dylight 594 donkey anti-sheep (1:50,
Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) or FITC-conjugated
donkey anti-mouse (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were applied for
1 hour. Sections were mounted in anti-fading medium containing 4′,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) that stains nuclei (Vectashield, Vector
Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). The experiments were repeated to
ensure reproducibility. Omission of the primary antibody served as a
negative control. Immunoreactivity was visualized at the appropriate
wavelengths with an epiﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon 80i; Tokyo, Japan)
and photographed with an attached Nikon DS-2Mv camera.
Qualitative assessment of immunohistochemical staining was evaluated
by two different human readers, blinded to the study details and with
extensive expertise in the ﬁeld. Pairwise comparisons of smooth muscle
cell layer immunoreactivity in the occluded MCA and non-occluded
MCA were performed. In addition, the expression was evaluated by
blinded measurement of the ﬂuorescence intensity in the smooth muscle
layer using the ImageJ software. The mean intensity in the occluded MCA
was normalized to the non-occluded MCA within the same animal. One
outlier was removed after analysis with Grubb’s test. For comparative
studies, immunoreactivity was visualized with the same microscope
settings during the same day. Quantiﬁcation of the immunoﬂuorescence
intensity was not performed in the vehicle group due to low animal
numbers and only qualitative assessment of the immunohistochemical
staining was performed for this group, see description above.

horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit (1:2,000; Cell Signaling) or antigoat (1:10,000; Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) antibodies for
1 hour. Protein bands were visualized by exposure to a charged coupled
device camera (LAS1000; Fujiﬁlm, Stamford, CT, USA) using a chemiluminescence kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Membranes were stripped and
reprobed for total levels of ERK1/2 (1:1,000; #9107, Cell Signaling). Active
dually phosphorylated ERK1/2 expressions levels were calculated as the
ratio of total levels of ERK1/2 normalized to SM22-α expression.

RESULTS
Endothelin Type B Receptor-Mediated Vasoconstriction and ERK1/2
Activation in Female Cerebral Arteries after In vitro Organ Culture
In initial experiments, in vitro organ culture of isolated cerebral
arteries was used to investigate whether increased ETB
receptor-mediated vasoconstriction and ERK1/2 activation, similar
to the observations in males, occur in females. Smooth muscle
cell-speciﬁc contractile responses were examined by application
of the selective ETB receptor agonist S6c in the presence of
L-NAME and indomethacin to block endothelial-mediated
responses by nitric oxide and prostaglandins. S6c elicited no
contractile responses in freshly obtained MCAs while a strong
vasoconstriction was seen after 24 hours of organ culture
(Figure 2A). There were no differences in the responses of MCAs
taken from animals killed at the time of estrus or diestrus (data not
shown); these data were pooled. ET-1-induced vasoconstriction
(measured after desensitization by S6c) was enhanced after organ
culture as compared with fresh arteries (Supplementary Table S3).
However, the contractile capacity (K+-induced responses) was
higher in cultured arteries than in nonincubated fresh arteries
(6.4 ± 0.5 vs 3.4 ± 0.5 mN).
Arteries incubated in the presence of U0126 (10 μmol/L)
resulted in a right-ward shift of the concentration–response curve
(change in pEC50), suggesting involvement of the MEK/ERK1/2
pathway in ETB receptor upregulation after organ culture
(Figure 2A). Activation of ERK1/2 was conﬁrmed at 6 hours of
organ culture by western blot (Figure 2B), and U0126 prevented
this process. Next, we investigated the role of ERK1/2 in ETB
receptor upregulation and outcome after experimental stroke.
ERK1/2-Mediated Increase in Endothelin Type B Receptor
Vasoconstriction In Female Rats after Transient Middle Cerebral
Artery Occlusion
Rats were subjected to 120 minutes tMCAO and thereafter treated
with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) at 0
and 24 hours of reperfusion. In concert to the in vitro results from
nonincubated arteries, left-side non-occluded MCAs elicited weak
contractile responses to S6c (Figure 2C). Occlusion of the right
MCA signiﬁcantly enhanced the ETB receptor-mediated contraction (Figure 2C). After treatment with U0126, the vasoconstriction
to S6c was markedly reduced. ET-1-induced vasoconstriction was
not signiﬁcantly different in non-occluded and occluded MCAs,
and not affected by U0126 (Supplementary Table S4).

Brain infarct volume 2 days after tMCAO was assessed using NeuN

were not signiﬁcantly different in the experimental groups

A long-term study was performed to investigate effects of
U0126 treatment on the neurologic function up to 14 days after
tMCAO. Neurologic function was assessed at 1, 2, 5, 8, and 14 days
after tMCAO by 28-point and 6-point neuroscores (Figures 4C
and 4D). Despite similar infarct volumes, there were signiﬁcant
improvements in the neurologic function at 2 and 14 days with

DISCUSSION
The main ﬁndings of this work are (1) vasoconstrictor ETB
receptors located in the smooth muscle cells are upregulated in
female rat MCAs subjected to in vivo tMCAO and in vitro organ
culture; (2) ETB receptor upregulation in females is mediated via
the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway (elevated p-ERK1/2), and (3) the MEK1/2
inhibitor U0126 given after tMCAO attenuates ischemia-induced
ETB receptor upregulation and improves the long-term sensorimotor function. These ﬁndings indicate that vasoconstrictor ETB
receptor upregulation, suggested to reduce cerebral blood ﬂow
and aggravate tissue damage after stroke, occurs in female rats
after focal cerebral ischemia, similar to the previous ﬁndings in

males.9,13 Our results suggest that the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126
could be a potential treatment for stroke in both sexes.
Endothelin Type B Receptor-Mediated Vasoconstriction after
Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion and Organ Culture
There are two subtypes of ET receptors; ETA receptor activation
results in vascular smooth muscle cell contraction and cell
proliferation,21 while ETB receptors normally are expressed on
endothelial cells where they induce vasodilatation and mediate
clearance of ET-1. However, ETB receptors have been shown to
induce vasoconstriction in rat mesenteric arteries22 and pulmonary resistance arteries from human and rat.23 We have previously
shown increased vasoconstriction mediated by ETB receptors in
the cerebral circulation after experimental stroke.8,9 Increased ETA
and ETB receptor mRNA and protein were found in the smooth
muscle cell layer of MCAs subjected to tMCAO.9,13 To this date,
studies on ET receptor plasticity in stroke, reviewed by,10 have
been conducted only on male rats.
Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism (2015), 454 – 460

A more complete understanding of the mechanisms underlying
sex differences in stroke could result in more appropriate
treatment strategies for patients of both sexes. To unravel ET
receptor-mediated vasoactive responses in females, MCAs were
subjected to tMCAO and organ culture followed by contractile
function studies with myograph. Signiﬁcantly increased ETB
receptor-mediated vasoconstriction was observed in right MCAs
subjected to tMCAO compared with the non-occluded left MCAs
where only weak contractile responses via ETB receptors were
detected (EMAX: 25% and 3%, respectively). Similar magnitude in
EMAX for ETB vasoconstriction has been reported in male MCAs
subjected to tMCAO followed by 24 hours of reperfusion [30%;11
40%;12 21%24) and to a larger extent after 48 hours of reperfusion
(EMAX: 68%9). Sex differences in ETB receptor-mediated contraction
have been observed in other disease models; male aortas from
hypertensive rats was reported to show a higher increase in ETB
receptor contraction than females.25 Additionally, we recently
discovered that organ cultured human cerebral arteries from
women are less responsive to ET-1 and angiotensin II than

males.19 There may be a sex difference in the ETB receptormediated vasoconstriction after tMCAO; however, additional
studies with direct comparison of males and females would be
needed to address this point. The present study explores ET
receptor-mediated responses in female MCAs subjected to
experimental stroke and organ culture. We found increased ETB
receptor-mediated vasoconstriction after in vivo experimental
stroke and in vitro organ culture, demonstrating that ETB receptor
upregulation previously reported for males, also occurs in females.

MEK/ERK1/2 pathway attenuates this response and signiﬁcantly
improves the long-term sensorimotor function. MEK1/2 inhibition
is therefore a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke in both
males and females.

Endothelin Type B Receptor Upregulation Is Mediated by MEK/
ERK1/2 Signaling Pathways
Next, we focused on underlying signaling pathways in ETB
receptor upregulation after tMCAO. ETB receptor upregulation
has been associated with increased activation of ERK1/2,13 which
was also seen in the present study as increased p-ERK1/2
expression in arteries after tMCAO and 6 hours of organ culture
assessed with immunohistochemistry and western blot, respectively. Increased p-ERK1/2 has been shown in numerous studies on
focal and global ischemia; however, whether its actions are
protective or detrimental are under debate.26 In the present study,
MEK1/2 inhibition by treatment with U0126 at 0 hour and 24 hours
after tMCAO attenuated the ischemia-induced increase in ETB
receptor-mediated vasoconstriction (EMAX: 25% vs 12% in U0126).
Additionally, U0126 prevented the increase in vascular smooth
muscle cell ETB receptor expression.
Improved Long-Term Neurologic Function by U0126
The infarct volume at 48 hours after tMCAO in the current study
was not affected by treatment with U0126. In contrast, our
previous results in males show signiﬁcantly reduced infarct
volume by U0126.12,13 Female rats experience less ischemic
damage than males when subjected to similar type of stroke,27
which the present data suggest. Estrogen has been suggested to
account for these differences by neuroprotective mechanisms,
and although the females in the present study were on low
estrogen at the day of surgery, previous hormonal exposure likely
has caused irreversible changes.
Importantly, treatment with U0126 improved the long-term
sensorimotor function up to 14 days after tMCAO. Similarly to the
present ﬁndings, improved motor control without affecting the
infarct size was recently reported for memantine treatment, an
N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist given 2
hours after the stroke.28 In the study by Lopez-Valdez et al,28
the authors suggest that neuroprotection did not have a signiﬁcant role in the improved neurologic outcome. The mechanisms
by which U0126 improves long-term neurologic function without
affecting the infarct volume in the present study are not known,
but we speculate that U0126 exerts beneﬁcial effects on the
cerebrovasculature that are not large enough to determine infarct
volume or to be detected by NeuN staining, but signiﬁcant
enough to contribute to improved long-term recovery after stroke.
Perhaps in females, where cerebral arteries are under larger
inﬂuence of endothelial vasodilatory mechanisms,29–31 increased
ETB receptor expression and cerebral vasoconstriction after stroke
might not have the same detrimental effect as in males, and
thereby determine infarct volume to a lesser extent. We suggest
that early activation of ERK1/2 is detrimental and by preventing its
action to reduce ETB receptor upregulation and vasoconstriction in
the acute phase, in return improved long-term poststroke
neurologic function is achieved.
CONCLUSION
The present study shows for the ﬁrst time in females that ETB
receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in cerebral arteries increases
after focal cerebral ischemia and organ culture. Inhibition of the
