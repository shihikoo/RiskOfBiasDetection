Abstract—The primary limitation of thrombolytic treatment
of ischemic stroke with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
is the hemorrhagic risk. We tested AcSDKP (N-acetyl-serylaspartyl-lysyl-proline), as an auxiliary therapeutic agent, to
reduce blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption in a combination tPA thrombolytic treatment of stroke. Wistar rats subjected to embolic stroke were randomly assigned to either
the tPA monotherapy group (n = 9) or combination of tPA
and AcSDKP treatment group (n = 9) initiated at 4 h after
ischemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements
were performed before and after the treatments. Immunohistochemical staining and measurements were performed to
conﬁrm MRI ﬁndings. Longitudinal MRI permeability measurements with gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic
acid (Gd-DTPA) demonstrated that combination treatment
of acute embolic stroke with AcSDKP and tPA signiﬁcantly
reduced BBB leakage, compared to tPA monotherapy, at 3
and 6 days (18.3 ± 9.8 mm3 vs 65.0 ± 21.0 mm3, p < 0.001)
after the onset of stroke, although BBB leakage was comparable between the two groups prior to the treatments
(6.8 ± 4.4 mm3 vs 4.3 ± 3.3 mm3, p > 0.18). The substantial
reduction of BBB leakage observed in the combination treatment group was closely associated with reduced ischemic
lesions measured by T2 maps (113.6 ± 24.9 mm3 vs
188.1 ± 60.8 mm3, p < 0.04 at 6 days). Histopathological
analysis of the same population of rats showed that the
combination treatment signiﬁcantly reduced parenchymal
ﬁbrin deposition (0.063 ± 0.059 mm2 vs 0.172 ± 0.103 mm2,
p < 0.03) and infarct volume (146.7 ± 35.9 mm3 vs
199.3 ± 60.4 mm3, p < 0.05) compared to the tPA monotherapy at 6 days after stroke. MRI provides biological

INTRODUCTION
Cerebral arterial thrombosis is the predominant cause of
ischemia which accounts for more than 80% of stroke
cases (Fieschi et al., 1989). The primary limitation of
thrombolytic treatment of ischemic stroke with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the risk of hemorrhage
(NINDS, 1997). Currently, only a small percentage of
patients receive tPA, despite the extension of the treatment window from 3 to 4.5 h (Hacke et al., 2008). However, in experimental studies, the treatment of embolic
stroke with tPA and adjuvant agents, such as statins
(Zhang et al., 2012), a proteasome inhibitor (Zhang
et al., 2012), or a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor
(Ding et al., 2005) extends the therapeutic window of
thrombolysis without increasing the risk of hemorrhage.
These agents also enhance the therapeutic eﬃcacy of
tPA (Ding et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2012). Thus, a proper
auxiliary therapeutic agent will reduce hemorrhagic risk,
enhance thrombolytic eﬃcacy and extend the therapeutic
window in combination treatment of thrombolysis with
tPA.
AcSDKP, a tetrapeptide (N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysylproline), exhibits cytokine characteristics (Yang et al.,
2004), although it is usually not classiﬁed as such due
to its small size. Containing anti-inﬂammation, anti-ﬁbrotic
and angiogenic properties, AcSDKP, therefore, is a
potential adjunctive candidate for thrombolysis with tPA.
AcSDKP is primarily a potent natural inhibitor of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation (Jackson et al., 2000).
However, AcSDKP also inhibits collagen production by
cardiac ﬁbroblasts in vitro (Zhuo et al., 2007); while
in vivo it blocks collagen deposition in the left cardiac ventricle in rats with hypertension or myocardial infarction
(Rasoul et al., 2004), and it reverses inﬂammation and
ﬁbrosis in rats with heart failure after myocardial infarction
(Yang et al., 2004). AcSDKP also acts as a mediator of
angiogenesis; it stimulates in vitro migration and diﬀerentiation of endothelial cells into capillary-like structures,
induces the formation of blood vessels (Liu et al., 2003),

and increases capillary density in rat heart with myocardial infarction (Wang et al., 2004).
We have demonstrated that the combination
thrombolytic therapy of embolic stroke with tPA and
AcSDKP is neuroprotective and eﬀective in maintaining
cerebral microvascular patency and integrity (Zhang
et al., 2014). In the present study, we focused on the evolution of the disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB)
after stroke in rats treated with tPA alone or combination
of tPA and AcSDKP. In order to compare BBB integrity
before and after receiving the thrombolytic treatments
for each animal, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
was employed to non-invasively evaluate the status of
BBB disruption.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All experimental procedures were conducted and
performed in accordance with guidelines for animal
research under a protocol approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the Henry Ford
Hospital. MRI scan and data analysis, embolic stroke
surgery and tPA treatments, and histological
measurements, were performed in a double-blind fashion.
Animal model and experimental protocol
Adult male Wistar rats (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor,
ME, USA) 8–12 weeks of age and weighing 300 to
350 g were subjected to embolic stroke. This model of
embolic stroke provides a reproducible infarct volume
localized to the territory supplied by the middle cerebral
artery (MCA) (Zhang et al., 1997). Brieﬂy, an aged white
clot (blood of a rat was withdrawn into 20 cm PE-50 tubing), which was prepared 24 h (retained at 25 °C for 2 h
and at 4 °C for 22 h) before stroke surgery, was slowly
injected into the internal carotid artery to the origin of
the MCA. The stroke rats were randomly assigned to
either the tPA alone treatment (monotherapy) group
(n = 9), or tPA and AcSDKP treatment (combination)
group (n = 9).
In the monotherapy group, recombinant human tPA
(Genentech,
San
Francisco,
CA,
USA)
was
administered intravenously at a dose of 10 mg/kg, 10%
bolus at 4 h after ischemia, and the remainder as a
continuous infusion with a syringe infusion pump
(Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA, USA) over a
30-min interval. Because the sensitivity of the rat to the
recombinant human tPA is 10 times lower than in
the human, dose of tPA received by rats (10 mg/kg)
in this experiment is 10 times higher than that used in
clinics (1 mg/kg) (Haelewyn et al., 2010). The selected
dose of tPA has been previously shown to be eﬀective
for this model (Zhang et al., 1997). In addition to being
administered the same protocol of tPA, the combination
group received AcSDKP at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg subcutaneously infused using an osmotic pump (Alzet, Cupertino,
CA, USA) from 4 to 72 h after embolic MCA occlusion
(MCAo). For the monotherapy group, rats received the
same ﬂuid volume of saline subcutaneously infused using
the osmotic pump.

MRI was performed prior to MCAo surgery, as an
internal control. MRI then was performed immediately
post MCAo, and at 72 and 144 h after MCAo for all rats.
All animals were euthanized 6d post stroke after
completing the last MRI scan.
MRI measurements
MRI was performed using a Varian 7T system (Varian Inc,
Palo Alto, CA, USA) with Bruker birdcage transmitter and
surface receiver coils (Bruker Company, Billerica, MA,
USA). During MRI measurements, the anesthesia was
maintained using a gas mixture of N2O (70%), O2
(30%), and isoﬂurane (1.00–1.50%) with a ﬂow of 1.0 L/
min, and stereotaxic ear bars were utilized to minimize
movement.
Rectal
temperature
was
kept
at
37 °C ± 1.0 °C using a feedback controlled air heater. A
fast gradient echo imaging sequence was used for
reproducible positioning of the animal in the magnet at
each MRI session. MRI sequences included
T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diﬀusion-weighted imaging
(DWI) and Look-Locker (L-L) sequence of T1
measurement for a quantitative permeability-related
parameter of blood-to-brain transfer rate constant (Ki) of
gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (GdDTPA, magnevistÒ, Berlex Inc, Montville, NJ, USA).
Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) was
composed of pre- and post-injection of Gd-DTPA. The
parameters for these pulse sequences were previously
described (Ding et al., 2005, 2006).
Immunohistochemical staining
Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection with
chloral hydrate, and were perfused transcardially with
saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were
isolated, post-ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days
at room temperature, and then processed for paraﬃn
sectioning. Coronal sections (6-lm thick) were cut from
each block and stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) for the evaluation of ischemic lesion and blood
red cells in cerebral parenchymal tissue using light
microscopy. A goat anti-mouse ﬁbrinogen/ﬁbrin antibody
was used at a titer of 1:1000 to assess the deposition of
ﬁbrin and ﬁbrinogen-related antigen in brain (Accurate
Chemical & Scientiﬁc, Westbury, NY, USA). Although
this antibody detects both ﬁbrin and ﬁbrinogen, the titer
of the antibody used in the present study primarily
reacted with ﬁbrin.
Data and statistical analysis
MRI image analysis was generally performed with
homemade software, Eigentool (Ding et al., 2005, 2006).
All two-dimensional (T1WI, T2WI, DWI, L-L) images were
reconstructed using a 128  128 matrix. The T2, apparent
diﬀusion coeﬃcient (ADC) of water or T1 maps were
obtained from T2WI, DWI or L-L images, respectively,
using a linear least-squares ﬁt to the plot of the natural logarithm. The MicroComputer Imaging Device (MCID)
system (Imaging Research Inc, Ontario, Canada) was
used for immunohistochemical measurements. H&E and

3

ﬁbrin-stained sections were evaluated at 10, or 40
magniﬁcations, respectively. The positive reaction areas
were measured by tracing the areas above the threshold
for each stained section on the computer monitor screen.
Ischemic lesion volumes of MRI were measured on
ADC maps immediately after MCAo, and on T2 maps for
the remaining times (3 and 6 days post MCAo) (Ding
et al., 2005). The mean plus two times standard deviation
(SD) of the contralateral measurements on the Ki map
was used as a threshold to identify region-of-interest
(ROI) with elevated Ki values, and the size and mean
value of the ROI on the Ki map were collected. The same
measurement was performed on the subtraction image of
pre-Gd T1WI from post-Gd T1WI. Referring to the image
intensity of the pre-Gd T1WI, the percentage of image
intensity increase was measured.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. The
eﬀect was detected at the 0.05 level. Pearson’s
correlation analysis and normal t-test were applied for
MRI and histological measurements. MRI and
histological measurements are summarized as mean
and SD.

RESULTS
The typical evolution patterns of MRI permeability, Ki, at
1, 72 and 144 h after stroke are demonstrated in Fig. 1
for representative rats with combination treatment of tPA
and AcSDKP (upper row) or with tPA monotherapy
(lower row), respectively. The cerebral tissue volumes
with elevated permeability values, which were employed
to evaluate the BBB disruption, increased more slowly in
the combination-treated rats than in monotherapy rats.
The quantitative Ki measurements, as shown in Table 1
and Fig. 2a, demonstrated that the volumes of elevated
permeability were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent at 1 h
(6.8 ± 4.4 mm3 for the combination group vs
4.3 ± 3.3 mm3 for the monotherapy group, p > 0.18);

however, the combination of tPA and AcSDKP
administration signiﬁcantly reduced the volumes with
elevated permeability at 72 h (30.1 ± 16.7 mm3 vs
64.0 ± 38.6 mm3, p < 0.04) and 144 h (18.3 ± 9.8 mm3
vs 65.0 ± 21.0 mm3, p < 0.001) after stroke in rats,
compared to tPA monotherapy. The mean Ki values of
the volumes with elevated permeability were not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent at all three times of measurement
between the two groups of rats (data not shown).
As shown in Fig. 3, T1WI images with Gd-DTPA
enhancement from the same animals as in Ki maps
(Fig. 1), exhibited similar evolution patterns as the Ki
maps. The quantitative data, in Fig. 2b, of volumes with
contrast

in
T1WI
demonstrated
approximately the same results as did Ki. Furthermore,
the elevated Ki volumes were highly correlated

Fig. 1. The typical evolution patterns of Ki, which detected BBB disruption at 1, 72 and 144 h after ischemic stroke, are demonstrated for a
representative rat treated with tPA and AcSDKP (upper row) or tPA alone (lower row), respectively. The volume with elevated permeability values
increased more slowly in the rat administered with tPA and AcSDKP than in the rat with tPA monotherapy.

Fig. 2. The MRI quantitative measurements demonstrated that the
tPA and AcSDKP treatment signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) reduced both
BBB disruption volumes measured by Ki (a) or CE-T1WI (b), and
ischemic lesion volumes by T2WI (c), at 72 and 144 h after stroke in
rats, compared to tPA monotherapy.

(R = 0.82, p < 10 4) with the Gd-DTPA-enhanced
volumes in T1WI images (Fig. 4a), and mean Ki values
in the measured volumes were highly correlated
(R = 0.83, p < 0.05) with increased percentages of
CE-T1WI image intensity (Fig. 4b), measured at 6d after
stroke.
The typical images from the representative rats are
presented in Fig. 5 to demonstrate the evolution of
ischemic lesion volumes after stroke. Starting with the
approximate same size and location of ischemic lesion
measured with ADC maps immediately after embolic
MCAo (left column, Fig. 5), the ischemic lesion volumes

on T2 maps (right columns, Fig. 5) in the combinationtreated rat (upper row, Fig. 5) were much smaller than
the volumes in the monotherapy rat (lower row, Fig. 5)
after stroke. Quantitative lesion volume measurements
(Fig. 2c) demonstrated that, no diﬀerences were
detected on the ADC maps immediately after stroke and
prior to the treatments between the two groups
(64.2 ± 10.1 mm3 vs 61.0 ± 11.6 mm3, p > 0.54);
however, signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found with T2
maps acquired 3d and 6d after stroke between the two
groups; for example, the ischemic lesion volumes were
113.6 ± 24.9 mm3 for the combination-treated rats and
188.1 ± 60.8 mm3 for the monotherapy rats 6d after
stroke (p < 0.04). The ratio of BBB disruption volume
per infarction volume is 0.16 ± 0.08 for the
combination-treated group, and 0.37 ± 0.14 for the
monotherapy group at 144 h after stroke.
Representative histological pictures are presented in
Fig. 6. On the H&E staining sections, the ischemic
lesion volumes were 146.7 ± 35.9 mm3 for the
combination-treated rats and 199.3 ± 60.4 mm3 for the
monotherapy rats, with signiﬁcant diﬀerences (p < 0.05)
between the two groups. Using ﬁbrin-stained section
(Fig. 6 A, C), the total ﬁbrin leakage areas were
0.063 ± 0.059 mm2
and
0.172 ± 0.103 mm2
for
combination
treatment
and
monotherapy
rats,
respectively. The total ﬁbrin leakage areas were
signiﬁcantly reduced in the combination-treatment
rats, compared to the monotherapy rats (p < 0.03).
With the H&E staining, erythrocyte presence in brain
parenchyma (Fig. 6B, D) was measured. The total area
containing erythrocytes were 0.018 ± 0.024 mm2 and
0.072 ± 0.190 mm2 for combination treatment and
monotherapy rats with MCID system, respectively.
Although no signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found between
the two groups (p > 0.4), the areas of parenchyma with
erythrocyte appeared larger in the monotherapy rats
than that in the combination-treated rats.
The ischemic lesion volumes obtained from T2 maps
acquired 6 days after stroke were signiﬁcantly correlated
with the histological measurements of lesion volumes
obtained from H&E staining (R = 0.67, p < 0.003). The
total elevated Ki areas (derived from volumes) were also
correlated with the ﬁbrin leakage areas (R = 0.80,
p < 0.001). Similarly, the total Gd-DTPA-enhanced
areas in T1WI images were signiﬁcantly correlated with
the ﬁbrin leakage areas (R = 0.77, p < 0.001).

DISCUSSION
The MRI permeability factor Ki is a measurement of the
blood-to-brain transfer constant, and provides the rate of
Gd-DTPA inﬂux. The elevated Ki values indicate BBB
damage leading to Gd-DTPA leakage (Ewing et al.,
2006). In this study, Ki directly and non-invasively tracks
the changes of BBB disruption before and after receiving
the thrombolytic treatment in vivo for every animal, and
provides more precise and reliable results than the traditional histological results, obtained in non-MRI studies
by sacriﬁcing diﬀerent animals at diﬀerent times. As a
result, our Ki measurements demonstrate that the

Fig. 3. The T1WI images acquired after Gd-DTPA injection exhibited smaller enhanced volumes in the representative rat treated with tPA and
AcSDKP (upper row) than in the rat with tPA monotherapy (lower row).

Fig. 4. Both Gd-DTPA-enhanced volumes (R = 0.82, p < 10 4; a)
and mean values in the volume (R = 0.83, p < 0.05; b) measured by
permeability Ki and CE-T1WI of Gd-DTPA were highly correlated at
6d after stroke in rats, respectively.

combination treatment, compared to tPA monotherapy,
signiﬁcantly reduces the volumes of the elevated Ki values at 3d and 6d after stroke, which indicates that the
combination treatment signiﬁcantly reduces the BBB disruption in embolic stroke rats. Furthermore, we found that

the Ki results of BBB disruption were consistent and signiﬁcantly correlated (R = 0.80, p < 0.001) with ﬁbrin
deposition in parenchymal tissue, measured at 6 days
after embolism.
Gd-DTPA leakage is a hallmark of BBB disruption (Lo
et al., 1994). With a molecular weight of approximate
1KDa, Gd-DTPA cannot cross the intact BBB. However,
disruption of the BBB allows accumulation of Gd-DTPA
in brain parenchyma, which primarily decreases the T1
constant of cerebral tissue where it accumulates, leading
to the increase of Ki values. Therefore, the elevated Ki
values reﬂect the BBB disruption and relate to T1WI
enhancement. Obviously, the evaluation of BBB disruption using MRI permeability measurements depends on
the size of contrast agent used in the experiment. The
intact BBB complex consists of endothelium, bounded
by the basal lamina, and is encompassed by the end-feet
of astrocytes. BBB damage after ischemia starts from
breakdown of basal lamina with loss of astrocyte and
endothelial cell contact, and subsequent increase of permeability to small molecules, such as Gd-DTPA, at an
early stage after stroke, and for cells (e.g. ﬁbrin and erythrocytes) in later times (Haring et al., 1996). The loss of
basal lamina structure with breakdown of the extracellular
matrix is the necessary step for the extravasation of
plasma, and at later times blood components, into the
brain parenchyma (Hamann et al., 1996). Therefore, the
correlation of the MRI Ki evaluation with the histological
measurements for BBB leakage strongly depends on
the contrast agent used in MRI and the molecular or
cellular size of leaked plasma or blood components
inspected in histology. Thus, the histological ﬁbrin measurements for the evaluation of BBB disruption should
have a much higher correlation with MRI Ki measurements with Gd-DTPA than do erythrocyte measurements,
since ﬁbrinogen has a molecular weight of 340KDa and
the ﬁbrin dimer is 45 nm in length (Walker and Nesheim,
1999; Chernysh and Weisel, 2008), much smaller than
erythrocyte with 6–8 lm in diameter.

Fig. 5. Starting with approximately the same size and location of ischemic lesion measured by ADC maps immediately after embolic MCAo (left
column), T2 maps (right two columns) in the rat treated with tPA and AcSDKP (upper row) exhibited much smaller lesion volumes than the rat treated
with tPA alone (lower row) at 3 and 6 days after stroke.

Fig. 6. The immunohistochemical staining slices are presented for the representative combination-treated rat and the tPA monotherapy rat. The
reduced H&E staining images at up-left corner of each panel display the locations for the corresponding immunohistochemical staining slices. The
ﬁbrin antigen-stained slices demonstrated that the ﬁbrin leakage was less severe in the rat receiving combination treatment (A) than tPA
monotherapy (C). Areas containing erythrocytes in brain parenchyma were much smaller in the combination-treated rat (B), than in the tPA
monotherapy rat (D).

The point of view above coincides with results of this
study. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found on
histological measurements of erythrocytes in brain
parenchyma between the combination treatment and the
tPA monotherapy rats (p > 0.4), although total areas of
erythrocyte evidence in brain parenchyma were much
smaller in the combination group than in the monotherapy
group (0.018 ± 0.024 mm2 vs 0.072 ± 0.190 mm2). One
reason may be the stroke model in the study. There is an

approximate 20% incidence of gross hemorrhage within
168 h from the ischemia onset without any treatment in
this embolic stroke model of rat (Zhang et al., 1997), and
approximately 40% of rats treated with tPA alone at 4 h post
MCAo exhibit gross hemorrhage within 48 h after stroke
(Ding et al., 2005). The gross hemorrhage, comparable
with symptomatic hemorrhage in the clinic, is deﬁned as
blood evident to the unaided eye on the H&E-stained
sections and conﬁrmed by microscopy. According to the

7

G. Ding et al. / Neuroscience 271 (2014) 1–8

power (0.85) calculation, populations of experiment groups
must be increase more than ten times the present number
to achieve a meaningful statistical diﬀerence for the evaluation of gross hemorrhage.
The permeability Ki and CE-T1WI measurements are
related (Ding et al., 2006). The present experiment demonstrated that both volume (R = 0.82, p < 10 4) and
mean (R = 0.83, p < 0.05) measurements of Ki,
obtained immediately after Gd-DTPA injection, and CET1WI, acquired 25 min after Gd-DTPA injection for the
post-Gd T1WI, were highly correlated (Fig. 4). Like Ki,
volumes measured by CE-T1WI for BBB disruption were
signiﬁcantly correlated with histological measurements
of ﬁbrin leakage areas (R = 0.77, p < 0.001). Hence,
substituting CE-T1WI for permeability Ki measurements
may be considered, if necessary, since CE-T1WI takes
much less MRI acquisition and image post processing
time.
In addition, the present MRI study has demonstrated
that the combination treatment with tPA intravenously
and with AcSDKP subcutaneously infused at a dose of
0.4 mg/kg, at 4 h of embolic stroke in rats, signiﬁcantly
reduced the ischemic lesion volumes at 3d and 6d after
stroke, compared with tPA monotherapy, with the MRI
results conﬁrmed by the histological measurements. Our
results, thus, indicate that the combination treatment of
tPA and AcSDKP initiated at 4 h after embolic MCAo is
a neuroprotective treatment, which is consistent with our
previous report (Zhang et al., 2014).
Cerebral ischemia upregulates tissue factor and
matrix
metalloproteinase
(MMP)
expression
in
endothelial cells (Lo et al., 2002), which facilitates
inﬂammation and BBB disruption (Rosell and Lo,
2008). Treatment with tPA after stroke signiﬁcantly
increases cerebral microvascular MMP immunoreactivity
(Zhang et al., 1999; Lo et al., 2002; Rosell and Lo,
2008); thus, delayed thrombolysis with tPA exacerbates
the disruption of the vascular integrity and intracerebral
hemorrhage after stroke (Lo et al., 2002), which limits
the clinical use of tPA. Following the ischemic insult,
toll-like receptors (TLRs) induce the expression of genes
encoding for inﬂammation and apoptosis via nuclear
transcription factor jB (NF-jB) (Caso et al., 2007). In
addition, elevation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(PAI-1) activity is included in the coagulation cascades
after ischemia (Zhang et al., 1999). Activation of transforming growth factor b1 (TGFb1) upregulates PAI-1
(Datta et al., 2000), which contributes to intravascular
ﬁbrin deposition after the onset of focal embolic ischemia
and directly obstructs cerebral microcirculation (Zhang
et al., 1999). However, previous studies showed that
AcSDKP treatment protects against renal and cardiac
damage via inhibiting TGFb1 and NF-jB mediated
inﬂammatory response and ﬁbrosis (Rhaleb et al.,
2013). Thus, the adjuvant AcSDKP in tPA treatment of
embolic stroke, via TLRs/NF-jB and TGFb1/PAI-1 pathways, may play an important role in regulating inﬂammation and thrombosis responses after stroke, leading to a
neuroprotective eﬀect of tPA administered at 4 h post
onset of MCAo and a decrease of BBB disruption after
embolic stroke.

CONCLUSIONS
The combination treatment of embolic stroke in rats with
tPA and AcSDKP initiated at 4 h after the onset of
MCAo signiﬁcantly reduced the volume of BBB
disruption measured in vivo at 72 and 144 h after stroke
by MRI, which was conﬁrmed by ex vivo measurements
with immunohistochemical stains, compared to tPA
monotherapy. The reduced BBB disruption may be
associated with lower hemorragic risk after receiving
thrombolytic treatment with tPA. MRI permeability Ki, as
well as CE-T1WI, measurements for BBB disruption
were consistent and highly correlated with histological
measurements of ﬁbrin antigen. These data suggest
that AcSDKP likely acts on the neurovascular unit to
enhance BBB integrity and exert the neuroprotective
eﬀect observed in the combination therapy.
