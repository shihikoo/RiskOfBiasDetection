Abstract A novel tetramethylpyrazine derivative,
CXC195, has been recently shown to protect against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the
detailed mechanisms underlying the neuroprotection of
CXC195 are still unclear. The aim of the present study was
to investigate the effects of CXC195 on the phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in response
to cerebral I/R and to determine whether phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway might be
involved. An in vitro model of oxygen glucose deprivation
(OGD) which was performed on primary cultured human
aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and an in vivo middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model that was performed on Wistar rats were used in this study. CXC195

increased nitric oxide (NO) production and the phosphorylation but not the protein level of eNOS in HAECs subjected to 1 h OGD followed by reperfusion. In addition,
CXC195 increased the phosphorylation of Akt; inhibition
of PI3K/Akt pathway by a specific inhibitor, wortmannin,
suppressed CXC195-induced NO release in HAECs. Consistently, CXC195 treatment significantly restored the
phosphorylations of eNOS and Akt in the cortical penumbra
of rats subjected to 2 h MCAO followed by reperfusion.
Moreover, wortmannin abolished CXC195-induced eNOS
phosphorylation and neuroprotection as evidenced by a
reversal of the reduction in infarct volume and neurobehavioral outcomes. In conclusion, CXC195 induced phosphorylation of eNOS by activation of PI3K/Akt signaling
under pathological cerebral I/R conditions, which provided
a novel explanation for the neuroprotective effect of
CXC195.

Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major
complication in stroke with the development of thrombolytic drugs and the protective effects of Chinese traditional
medicines are being paid more and more attention to. Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is the most important extract
from the traditional Chinese herb Chuanxiong (Ligusticum
wallichii FRANCHAT), which is widely used in China for
the treatment of ischemic stroke [1–3]. A novel TMP
derivative, CXC195 (Fig. 1), has been recently demonstrated to show a better beneficial effect than TMP in

protecting against cerebral I/R injury in rats [4]. However,
the detailed mechanisms by which CXC195 protects
against cerebral I/R injury have not been completely
elucidated.
Nitric oxide (NO), an important signaling molecule in
the central nervous system, is generated by three different
types of NO synthase (NOS) including the constitutive
Ca2?/calmodulin-dependent neuronal and endothelial isoforms (nNOS and eNOS, respectively) and the inducible
calcium-independent isoform (iNOS). In the brain, NO
produced by eNOS may be neuroprotective through scavenging of ROS [5, 6], anti-inflammatory effect [7, 8]
besides regulation of cerebral blood flow [9]; whereas
pathological concentrations of NO from iNOS and nNOS
are linked to neuro inflammation and neurodegeneration.
Therefore, NO plays a paradoxical role as either a protective or a pathogenic factor depending on NO levels, NO
source and the local environment [9, 10].
eNOS activation is regulated by multisite phosphorylation of eNOS. Among the specific sites, Ser1177
phosphorylation is considered as one of the most important events for the regulation of eNOS activity. In a rat
cerebral ischemia model, the phosphorylation of eNOS (peNOS) at Ser1177 modulates cerebral blood flow and
improves the outcome following ischemia [11]. The serine/threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B,
enhances survival with cerebral ischemia through a
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling
pathway [12]. Recent studies have shown that Akt phosphorylates eNOS at Ser1177 in response to varied stimuli
[13]. CXC195 has been proved to protect the endothelial
cells (ECs) [14] and significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of Akt in rat subjected to I/R [15]. However,
it is unknown whether CXC195 protected against cerebral
I/R by regulating phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177 via
PI3K/Akt pathway. Therefore, in the present study, we
examined whether CXC195 treatment induced NO production and eNOS phosphorylation in ECs, and the
potential role of PI3K/Akt/p-eNOS signaling pathway in
the neuroprotection of CXC195 on the rats subjected to
2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed
by reperfusion.

The compound CXC195 was synthesized by Professor
Xinyong Liu’s lab. Its purity ([98 %) was determined by
HPLC. All chemicals and reagents used in this study were
of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma–
Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) unless otherwise mentioned.
Primary antibody anti-eNOS, anti-p-eNOS (Ser1177), antiAkt (total) and anti-p-Akt (Ser473) were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). NO2-/
NO3- Assay Kit was purchased from Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology (Shanghai, China).
Cell Culture and Treatment
Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured (37 °C, 5 % CO2) in
endothelial cell growth medium-2, consisting of endothelial cell basal medium supplemented with 5 % fetal bovine
serum, gentamicin/amphotericin B and growth supplements. Confluent HAECs ([90 %) in passages 3–6 were
used for this study. For oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)
experiments, cells were incubated in OGD buffer (51 mM
NaCl, 65 mM K-gluconate, 0.13 mM CaCl2, 1.5 mM
MgCl2 and 10 mM HEPES pH 6.8, penicillin and streptomycin). The buffer was deoxygenated using nitrogen for
30 min before the cell treatment. Cells were incubated for
1 h at 37 °C on a humidified incubator set to 5 % CO2,
95 % N2. Reoxygenation was induced by changing the
media and returning the cells to the regular humidified
incubator with 5 % CO2 and ambient O2 concentration
(non-hypoxic conditions). Control cells were incubated in
regular media in non-hypoxic conditions. For drug treatment, CXC195 (1, 10, 100 lM) was added at beginning of
reperfusion. L-N5-(1-iminoethyl)-ornithine (L-NIO, 100
lM) and the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (100 lM) were
added 30 min before OGD.
NO Assay
NO levels in supernatant of HAECs were measured by the
Griess method using an NO2-/NO3- Assay Kit according
to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Animals
Male Wistar rats (270–300 g) were purchased from Laboratory Animals Center of Shandong University, China.
Animals were randomly divided into the following groups:
(1) sham operated group; (2) I/R group; rats treated with

vehicle (1 % dimethyl sulfoxide in normal saline) intraperitoneally 2 and 12 h after the onset of ischemia; (3)
CXC195 group; I/R treated with 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg dose of
CXC195 (dissolved in vehicle) intraperitoneally 2 and 12 h
after the onset of ischemia. To elucidate the mechanisms
underlying the increase in eNOS phosphorylation in
response to CXC195 in rats subjected to I/R, wortmannin
was intraventricularly administered to rats with or without
CXC195 30 min before MCAO. The scalp was incised on
the midline and the skull was exposed. Wortmannin
(100 nM in 1 % dimethyl sulfoxide in normal saline) or the
vehicle (1 % dimethyl sulfoxide in normal saline) was
injected using a Hamilton syringe (10 lL, 0.5 mm posterior and 1.4 mm lateral to the bregma and 3.1 mm from
the dura mater). All the procedures were performed following institutional approval in accordance with Shandong
University Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia Model
MCAO model was established by occlusion of the left
MCA with the use of a nylon monofilament as described
previously [16]. In brief, anesthesia was induced using
10 % chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg). Temperature was
maintained between 36.5 and 37.5 °C with a homeothermal
blanket. The left common and external carotid arteries
were isolated and ligated. A nylon monofilament was
introduced from the common carotid artery into the internal
carotid artery until a resistance was encountered, thus
blocking the origin of the middle cerebral artery. A successful occlusion was indicated by a decrease in the
regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to \20 % of the
baseline by transcranial laser-Doppler (Perimed, Jarfalla,
Sweden) measurement in the area of cerebral cortex supplied by the middle cerebral artery. 2 h later, reperfusion
was initiated by thread withdrawal. The neurological deficit
of the rats was evaluated after 24 h of reperfusion, then the
rats were anesthetized and then decapitated. The brains
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for the following studies.
Infarct Volume and Neurological Deficit Assessment
Outcomes were assessed at 24 h after reperfusion using
both cerebral infarct volume and a 4-tiered neurological
scoring system as described previously [4].
Immunofluorescence Staining
Staining was performed on brain sections as described
previously [17]. Anti-p-eNOS (Ser1177) (1:200) was used
in this study. Following immunofluorescence, the sections

123

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:446–454

were mounted with an antifading solution containing
200 mg/ml of DAPI as a nuclei counterstain, then examined by Olympus Biological Microscope (BX53, Japan).
Western Blot Analyses
Western blot analysis was performed as described previously [18]. Protein concentration was measured with the
BCA assay (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Protein samples
were mixed with 29 loading buffer and boiled for 5 min.
An equal amount of protein per lane was separated by
8–12 % SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to PVDF
(Polyvinylidene fluoride) membranes. The membranes
were blocked in 5 % non-fat milk in TBS-T (tris buffer
PBS/0.1 % Tween 20) and incubated with primary antibodies of anti-eNOS (total) (1:1,000), anti-p-eNOS
(Ser1177) (1:1,000), anti-p-Akt (ser473) (1:500), anti-Akt
(total) (1:1,000), overnight at 4 °C, respectively. To document the loading controls, the membrane was reprobed
with a primary antibody against GAPDH. The signals were
quantified by scanning densitometry and data within a
linear range were quantified using Image Quant software
(GE Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Statistical Analysis
Values are presented as mean ± SEM.; the significance of
the differences in mean values between and within multiple
groups was examined by one-way ANOVA followed by
Duncan’s multiple range test. P \ 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
CXC195 increased NO production in HAECs subjected to
1 h OGD followed by 24 h reoxygenation (OGD/R) via
increased the phosphorylation of eNOS.
To evaluate the effects of CXC195 on EC function, we
measured NO production, eNOS expression and activation of
eNOS and Akt. The effect of CXC195 on NO production in
HAECs subjected to OGD/R was evaluated by using the
Griess reagent. As shown in Fig. 2a, OGD/R stimulation
decreased NO production to 35.45 % of the control. The levels
of nitrite in cultured medium were significantly increased with
10 and 100 lM CXC195 treatment. Additionally, L-NIO, the
selective eNOS inhibitor, totally abrogated the CXC195induced increase in NO production (Fig. 2d).
The increase in NO production might be through the
induction of eNOS expression or phosphorylation. However,
eNOS protein level was not affected markedly by CXC195
treatment (Fig. 2b). Since CXC195 did not alter the protein
expression of eNOS obviously, increased activity of eNOS

could be involved in the CXC195-induced NO production. It
has been reported that phosphorylation of eNOS plays an
important role in the regulation of its enzymatic activity in
ECs. We next examined the effect of CXC195 on the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1177 in HAECs. The results
showed that CXC195 induced the phosphorylation of eNOS
at Ser-1177 in a dose-depend manner in HAECs subjected to
OGD/R (Fig. 2b). Moreover, compared with OGD/R treatment, CXC195 similarly significantly increased Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2c).
CXC195 Induced eNOS Phosphorylation Through
PI3K/Akt Signaling in HAECs Subjected to OGD/R
To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increase in
eNOS phosphorylation in response to CXC195 in ECs

subjected to OGD/R, wortmannin, a specific inhibitor for
PI3K was utilized to clarify the involvement in this
response. CXC195-induced eNOS and Akt phosphorylations (Fig. 3) and NO production (Fig. 2d) were significantly attenuated by wortmannin. These results implied an
essential role of PI3K/Akt signalling in CXC195-mediated
eNOS activation in HAECs.

significantly increased the ratio of p-eNOS (Ser1177)/eNOS

(100 lM). Cells were lysed and subjected to western blot analysis for

protein. Immunostaining results also showed that p-eNOS
(Ser1177)-positive cells in the cortical penumbra of the
vehicle-treated rats subjected to I/R injury were much fewer
than in sham-operated rats; their number was increased in
CXC195-treated rats (Fig. 4b). Similarly, CXC195 treatment
preserved the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 in the cortical
penumbra of rats subjected to I/R injury (Fig. 4c).
CXC195 Induced Phosphorylation of eNOS Via PI3K/
Akt Pathway in the Cortical Penumbra in Rats
Subjected to I/R Injury
Treatment with CXC195 plus wortmannin markedly lowered both eNOS and Akt phosphorylation levels when
compared with CXC195 alone (Fig. 5a, b). Moreover, pretreatment with wortmannin completely abolished the
reduced infarct volume (Fig. 5c, d) and neurological scores
(Fig. 5e) noted in animals treated with CXC195 alone (34.
70 ± 3.165 and 24.23 ± 2.51, 2.75 ± 0.25 and 1.75 ±
0.31 %, respectively). These results strongly suggested that
CXC195 ameliorated cerebral I/R injury by inducing eNOS
phosphorylation through PI3K/Akt pathway.

Discussion
CXC195 was previously demonstrated neuroprotective
effect in a cerebral I/R rat model [4, 15]. The present
study provided novel data that CXC195 stimulated the
phosphorylation of eNOS and increased NO production
via a PI3K/Akt dependent mechanism in ECs and rats
subjected to I/R injury. Moreover, inhibition of PI3K/Akt
pathway by wortmannin abolished the neuroprotection of
CXC195. Collectively, our findings indicated that PI3K/
Akt dependant eNOS activation and NO production may
contribute to the neuroprotective effects of CXC195 on
stroke.
NO derived from eNOS plays a protective effect on
brain tissue under I/R injury, such as vasodilation, antiplatelet aggregation, and anti-inflammtion [7–9]. CXC195
previously has been shown to protect ECs against H2O2
injury [14], however if it affects NO production and the

underlying mechanism are completely unknown. Here, we
found that NO production in ECs subjected to OGD/R was
increased after treatment with CXC195, selectively inhibiting eNOS totally abrogated CXC195-induced NO production, but CXC195 did not significantly affect eNOS
protein expression both in cultured ECs and brain tissue
after I/R injury.
NO production is also regulated by the activity of eNOS.

frequently used to evaluate cerebrovascular function
because this phosphorylation state plays pivotal roles in
modulating eNOS activity and subsequently regulating
CBF and the outcome of ischemic injury [11]. Src kinase,
PI3K/Akt, protein kinase A (PKA), PKC, or AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are key kinases for eNOS
phosphorylation [19–24]. Yoshitomi et al. [25] demonstrated that phosphorylation of eNOS and Akt were
decreased in the cerebral cortex of spontaneously hypertensive rats-stroke prone (SHRSP) compared with that in
Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Increase in p-Akt at Ser437 was
observed transiently 0.5–2 h after reperfusion, elevation of
p-eNOS at Ser1177 was observed from 4 to 12 h after
reperfusion, whereas both of them are much lower at 24 h
after reperfusion than sham group [26, 27]. Our previous
studies have demonstrated focal ischemic brain injury
decreased the levels of phosphorylated Akt and CXC195
significantly improved the phosphorylation of Akt [15],
which indicates that CXC195 may positively affect eNOS
phosphorylation. In cultured HAECs, it was shown that
CXC195 enhanced eNOS activity and NO production
through PI3K/Akt dependent phosphorylation of eNOS at
Ser1177. Consistent with the in vitro study, in MCAO rats,
a transient focal brain ischemic animal model, CXC195
treatment significantly restored eNOS phosphorylation
together with the recovery of Akt phosphorylation at 24 h
after reperfusion. Moreover, blockade of PI3K activity by
wortmannin abolished CXC195-induced eNOS phosphorylation and neuroprotection as shown by a reversal of the
reduction in infarct volume and neurobehavioral outcomes.
These results provided direct evidence that PI3K related
signaling pathway was associated with CXC195-induced
neuroprotection.
In conclusion, the evidence presented here strongly
supported CXC195 induced phosphorylation of eNOS by
activation of PI3K/Akt signaling under pathological cerebral I/R conditions. Our discovery provided a novel
explanation for the neuroprotective effect of CXC195 in
the treatment of cerebrovascular disease.
