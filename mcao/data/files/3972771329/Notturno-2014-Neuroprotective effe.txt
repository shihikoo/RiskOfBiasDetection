Experimental focal brain ischemia generates in the penumbra recurrent depolarizations which spread across the
injured cortex inducing infarct growth. Transcranial direct current stimulation can induce a lasting, polarityspeciﬁc, modulation of cortical excitability. To verify whether cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation
could reduce the infarct size and the number of depolarizations, focal ischemia was induced in the rat by the 3
vessels occlusion technique. In the ﬁrst experiment 12 ischemic rats received cathodal stimulation (alternating
15 min on and 15 min off) starting 45 min after middle cerebral artery occlusion and lasting 4 h. In the second
experiment 12 ischemic rats received cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation with the same protocol
but starting soon after middle cerebral artery occlusion and lasting 6 h. In both experiments controls were 12
ischemic rats not receiving stimulation. Cathodal stimulation reduced the infarct volume in the ﬁrst experiment
by 20% (p = 0.002) and in the second by 30% (p = 0.003). The area of cerebral infarction was smaller in animals
receiving cathodal stimulation in both experiments (p = 0.005). Cathodal stimulation reduced the number of
depolarizations (p = 0.023) and infarct volume correlated with the number of depolarizations (p = 0.048).
Our ﬁndings indicate that cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation exert a neuroprotective effect in the
acute phase of stroke possibly decreasing the number of spreading depolarizations. These ﬁndings may have
translational relevance and open a new avenue in neuroprotection of stroke in humans.

1. Introduction
Experimental ischemia generates electrical instability in the penumbra manifesting with recurrent spontaneous waves of depolarization
denominated peri-infarction depolarizations (PIDs) [15,26]. These
depolarizations spread across the injured cortex into the normally perfused tissue, where they take the characteristics of cortical spreading
depression (CSD), inducing transient depression of electrocorticogram
[15]. Infarct size correlates, in the stroke experimental model, with the
numbers of PIDs or duration of PID aggregates [7,24], and the PID
number is the independent, determining variable in this relationship [3].
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive modulation of brain excitability currently employed to

modulate brain excitability in many neurological disorders [10,34].
TDCS induces lasting alterations of cortical excitability and changes in
neural cell membrane potential by manipulating ion channels or by
shifting electrical gradients which inﬂuence the electrical balance of
ions inside and outside the neural membrane. The direction of the excitability shifts is determined by the current polarity [27,28,30]. Experimental and human studies suggested that the after-effects of tDCS
might originate from persistent modiﬁcations of synaptic efﬁcacy similar to those underlying long-term potentiation and long-term depression of synaptic activity studies [16,20]. In vivo cathodal polarization
directly applied to the cortical surface in rats is able to completely
block CSD and it has been demonstrated that tDCS interferes with the
propagation velocity of CSD in a focal and polarity-speciﬁc way that
lasts beyond the end of tDCS [21,32].
A very recent study showed that cathodal tDCS applied intermittently for 40 min in the acute phase of stroke due transitory middle cerebral
artery (MCA) occlusion in the mouse reduced infarct volume and promotes a better clinical recovery [31].

The aim of this study was to verify the safety and efﬁcacy of long
duration cathodal tDCS in the acute phase of stroke induced the rat by
the permanent 3 vessels occlusion technique. TDCS was discontinuously
applied, with cycles of 15 min of stimulation alternating with 15 min of
no stimulation up to 180 min. Moreover we investigated whether cathodal tDCS could inhibit recurrent depolarizations.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Fifty-three male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, Udine,
Italy) 8–9 weeks old and weighting 165–265 g at the time of surgery
were employed in the study. The rats were housed under 12 hour
light/dark cycle and room temperature of 22 °C. Animals were provided
with food and water ad libitum. All experiments were approved by the
Cantonal Veterinary Authority of Ticino, Switzerland and conducted
according to guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals
(Kantonales Veterinäramt Zürich, Switzerland). Effort was made to
minimize the number of animals used. The experiments were carried
out in the laboratory of the Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland in
Bellinzona.
2.2. Induction of focal cerebral ischemia
Cerebral ischemia in the left hemisphere was induced by permanent
occlusion of the MCA, permanent occlusion of the ipsilateral distal
common carotid artery, and temporary occlusion of the contralateral
common carotid artery [5,37]. The rats were anesthetized with 2%
isoﬂurane in 2 l/min of O2. A 2 cm vertical skin incision was made midway between the ear and the eye. The skull was exposed where the
frontal bone joins the temporal bone and a small area (5 × 5 mm) of
the bone overlying the MCA was removed (Fig. 1). After removing the
dura mater, the MCA and its three main branches dorsal to the rhinal ﬁssure were occluded by bipolar electrocoagulation. The common carotid
artery ipsilateral to the occluded MCA was ligated permanently using a
4–0 silk suture thread. Finally, the contralateral common carotid artery
was temporarily occluded for 60 min by an aneurism clip. Body temperature was maintained using a heating pad servo-controlled by a rectal
temperature probe. The left femoral artery was cannulated for continuous blood pressure monitoring by a blood pressure transducer
(Harvard, 220 VAC/50 Hz) and for serial measurements of pO2, pCO2
and glucose concentration (Radiometer ABL 5).
2.3. Transcranial direct current stimulation
TDCS was applied using a constant current stimulator (DC-stimulator
Eldith, Germany).

147

The epicranial electrode was a home-made plastic jacket with an
inner diameter of 3 mm ﬁxed on the skull 2 mm left and 1 mm posterior
to the bregma (Fig. 1). Fixation was achieved by an ionomeric cement
(Ketac Cem, ESPE Dental AG, Seefeld, Germany). The jacket was ﬁlled
with cotton wool soaked in saline solution (0.9% NaCl) resulting in a
contact surface of 7 mm2. To prevent the bypassing of currents that
would occur in the case of two juxtaposed epicranial electrodes and to
induce polarity-speciﬁc tDCS effects, a rubber electrode (10.5 cm2)
was positioned on the ventral side of the thorax [22]. The electrode on
the skull was connected to the cathode and the electrode on the chest
to the anode of the stimulator. A constant current intensity of 0.2 mA
(current density of 2.86 mA/cm2) was applied, within the reported
limits of safety and tolerability [23]. The stimulation protocol consisted
of cycles of 15 min of stimulation alternating with15 min of no stimulation. This protocol was chosen because in rats PIDs are frequent and separated by an interval of 5–10 min and in mice a reduction of the
amplitude of the motor potentials, evoked by a transcranial electrical
stimulation, is observed for 10 min after a cathodal tDCS lasting for
10 min [4,25]. In the not stimulated animals the electrodes were positioned on the skull and the chest without delivering the stimulation.
The rats were maintained under slight anesthesia by 2% isoﬂurane in
1 l/min of O2 and analgesia by buprenorphine 0.03 mg/kg during real
and sham tDCS. At the end of the experiment the rats, once awake,
were placed back into their home cages.
2.4. Brain damage analysis
Forty-eight hours after the induction of the ischemia, the rats were
decapitated under isoﬂurane anesthesia. The brain was rapidly removed, frozen in dry ice and stored at −80 °C. For each brain, sections
of 20 μm corresponding to six levels [A = +2.7 (L1), +1.7 (L2), +0.7
(L3), −0.3 (L4), −1.3 (L5), −2.3 (L6) mm from bregma] were cut on
a cryostat [29]. Twelve to 15 slices for each level were mounted on
SuperFrost Plus (Menzel GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) for histological evaluation. To assess the infarct volume, all the sections were ﬁrst
ﬁxed by means of PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at
room temperature and then stained with cresyl violet. On digitized
cresyl violet sections the infarct area was delineated and measured
using the NIH Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The infarct
volume was estimated knowing the distance between each chosen
level and corrected for the edema by multiplying the ratio of the contralateral to ipsilateral volume and taking also into account the volume of
the contralateral hemisphere [11]. Moreover, the brain swelling was
calculated as follows: [(ipsilateral hemisphere volume − contralateral
hemisphere volume) / contralateral hemisphere volume] × 100 [17].
To assess the potential damage induced by tDCS coronal brain
sections of 20 μm thickness were cut serially from the block on a microtome, mounted on a glass slide, and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin.
2.5. Recording and analysis of slow potential changes

the electrode for cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and of the recording direct current (DC)-coupled electrode in relation to bregma (adapted from
[29]). Further details are given in the Methods section.

A slow potential change (SPC) is the hallmark of both peri-infarction
depolarizations and cortical spreading depression [9,18,19]. We recorded SPCs in direct current modality by using a gold coated miniature
screw (0.9 mm diameter) inserted in the skull overlying the infarcted
hemisphere 1.0 mm left and 1.5 mm anterior to bregma (Fig. 1). Care
was taken not to pass the dura and this was veriﬁed by histology. The
head of the screw was soldered to a multipolar connector and the
assembly was ﬁxed to the skull with cement. The reference was an
Ag/AgCl electrode placed in the neck musculature and the animal was
grounded with a steel needle electrode inserted into the hind limb
and connected to the Faraday cage. The signals were ampliﬁed in direct
current modality (AC/DC Differential Ampliﬁer Model 3000), digitized
at 1000 Hz (CED 14101 mKII) and after analog-to-digital conversion
stored into a computer for subsequent analyses ofﬂine by Spike2

software (CED, UK). SPCs were recorded right after MCA occlusion for
the following 6 h. For quantitative analysis a SPC was deﬁned as a shift
in direct current potential of amplitude (negative to positive peak)
≥0.5 mV. The duration of SPCs was calculated as the interval between
the starting point and the return to the baseline. The number, the frequency (number of SPCs in 1 h), the mean amplitude and the mean duration in each animal were calculated.

measures ANOVA was applied to the number of SPCs, with Stimulation
type as between subject factor and Time (hour 1–6) as within subject
factor. For all these 16 rats Pearson correlation was performed in
order to assess a link between the number and duration of SPCs and
the infarct volume.

2.6. Experiments and experimental groups

3.1. Physiological variables

Two experiments were performed (Fig. 2). In the ﬁrst experiment 12
rats, 45 min after MCA occlusion, received cathodal tDCS for 4 h with a cumulative duration of stimulation of 120 min (group 1); 12 rats were not
stimulated after ischemia (group 2). Since PIDs start in rats soon after
MCA occlusion [13], to anticipate the onset and increase the duration of
tDCS without prolonging excessively the anesthesia, the time for the surgical procedure to MCA occlusion was shortened of about 1 h and tDCS
was started immediately after the MCA occlusion (Fig. 2). In this second
experiment 12 rats received cathodal tDCS for 6 h with a cumulative duration of stimulation of 180 min (group 3); 12 rats were not stimulated
after ischemia (group 4). Five rats (group 5) went through the same surgical procedure of the other animals except for the occlusion of MCA and
carotid cerebral arteries (sham ischemia) and received cathodal tDCS for
6 h.
Since we thought important to maintain comparable in all animals
the effect of isoﬂurane, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, in
the possible inhibition of depolarizations the duration of anesthesia
was approximately 9 h for all experimental groups (Fig. 2). In 16 animals of the experiment 2 (8 animals of group 3, treated with tDCS,
and 8 animals of group 4, not stimulated) SPCs were recorded as described above.

Rectal temperature was 36.5 ± 0.5 °C before MCA occlusion,
increased to an average of 37.5 ± 0.5 °C within 2 h and returned to
previous values at the end of the experiment.
Baseline blood glucose levels were 160 ± 20 mg/dl before the surgery and raised to 200 ± 30 mg/dl within 4–6 h. An increase of blood
glucose has been described in the rodent models of cerebral ischemia
[12]. Blood pressure and blood gases remained in the normal range
during the experiment.

2.7. Statistical analysis
Gaussian distribution of values was veriﬁed by Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test. To identify the effect of tDCS on infarct volume, independent sample
t-test was applied for each experiment to compare the volume values of
the rats stimulated with real tDCS with those of the not stimulated rats.
Moreover, to check for possible speciﬁc effects of stimulation on
predeﬁned brain levels, repeated measures ANOVA was applied to the
different infarct area values of brain levels, with Stimulation type (real
stimulation, no stimulation) as between-subject factors and Level (L1–
L6) as within subject factor.
In the rat of experiment 2, in which SPCs were recorded (8 stimulated rats of group 3 and 8 not stimulated rats of group 4), repeated

3. Results

3.2. Infarct area and volume
We did not ﬁnd macroscopic or microscopic lesions in the brains of
group 5 rats with sham ischemia and cathodal tDCS for 6 h.
The volume of cerebral infarction was signiﬁcantly smaller in animals receiving cathodal tDCS (group 1 and 3) than no stimulation
(group 2 and 4), both in experiments 1 and 2. The volume reduction
between groups of stimulated and not stimulated rats was 20% in experiment 1 (62 ± 6 mm3 vs 78 ± 14 mm3, independent t-test t (22) =
3.650, p = 0.001), and 30% in experiment 2 (38 ± 9 mm3 vs 55 ±
15 mm3, independent t-test t (22) = 3.381, p = 0.003) (Fig. 3A).
The ANOVA design on the area of cerebral infarction evidenced the
main effects of Stimulation Type both in experiment 1 (F(1,22) = 9.648;
p = 0.005) and experiment 2 (F(1,22) = 9.648; p = 0.005). The lack of
the interaction Stimulation Type × Level (p N 0.05 in both experiments)
suggests that this reduction was not speciﬁc for some levels. In Fig. 3B
are reported representative coronal brain sections showing the infarct
area at the 6 predeﬁned levels in a rat receiving cathodal tDCS and in
a not stimulated rat of experiment 2.
In the second experiment the infarct area and volumes resulted smaller both in the stimulated (group 3) and not stimulated (group 4) animals
compared to the ﬁrst experiment (Fig. 3A). Anyway the comparisons
were always made between groups inside the same experiment.
We found no signiﬁcant effects in brain swelling between stimulated
and not stimulated rats in both experiments 1 and 2 (16 ± 7% and 19 ±
9% respectively, independent t-test p N 0.1 consistently).

transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and no stimulation. Note that the duration of surgery in the animals belonging to groups 3 and 4 was about 1 h shorter than in the animals
belonging to groups 1 and 2. TDCS was started about 45 min after MCA occlusion in groups 1 and 2 and immediately after the MCA occlusion in groups 3 and 4.

3.3. SPCs
SPCs were recorded in 8 rats of group 3 treated with tDCS for 6 h and
in 8 rats of group 4 receiving no stimulation. Within few minutes after
MCA occlusion, SPCs appeared and recurred periodically during the 6 h
of recordings (Fig. 4A). The analyzed SPCs had amplitudes ranging
from 0.5 to 4.9 mV and duration up to 50 s. The ANOVA design returned
a Stimulation Type effect (F(1,14) = 8.210; p = 0.012) and a lack of significance of the interaction Time × Stimulation Type (p N 0.05). Indeed, the
stimulated rats displayed a total number of SPCs lower than the non
stimulated rats (19.8 ± 11.7 vs 112.3 ± 90.5; independent sample ttest: t (7.2) = − 2.865, p = 0.023). The difference in the number of
SPCs between group 3 and group 4 rats was already signiﬁcant during
the ﬁrst hour after the MCA occlusion and remained signiﬁcant for the
following 5 h (lack of the signiﬁcance Time × Stimulation Type, Fig. 4B).
The inter-rat variability of the number of SPCs was much greater in the
not stimulated rats (SD = 90.5) than in the rats receiving
cathodal tDCS (SD = 11.9) as indicated by the Levene's test for equality
of variances (p b 0.001).
No difference in the mean amplitude and mean duration of SPCs was
found between stimulated and not stimulated rats (independent t-test
p N 0.200, consistently).
In the 16 animals in which SPCs were recorded, a positive correlation
was found between the total number of SPCs and the infarct volume
(Pearson's r = 0.501, p = 0.048, Fig. 4C). No correlation was found between the total duration of SPCs and the infarct volume (p N 0.200).

4. Discussion
In this study we applied cathodal tDCS during the very early phase of
stroke induction employing a current density approximately half of the
current density used in studying the anticonvulsant effect in a rat model
of focal epilepsy [22]. Although we cannot exclude that because of the
operculum in the skull the actual current reaching the cerebral cortex
was higher, we did not ﬁnd macroscopic nor microscopic lesions in
the brains of rats with sham ischemia which received tDCS for a cumulative time of 180 min conﬁrming that the stimulation technique was
safe even with a duration of stimulation four and half times longer
that in the mouse [31].
Cathodal tDCS was able to reduce the infarct size, compared to controls, by 20% in the animals stimulated (15 min on and 15 min off) for
4 h. In the animals in which the onset of stimulation was anticipated
soon after MCA occlusion and lasted 6 h the infarct size was reduced,
compared to controls by 30%.
TDCS signiﬁcantly reduced not only the number but interestingly
also the inter-rat variability of SPCs in the whole period of stimulation.
The link between number of PIDs and infarct size is thought to be causal
since eliciting PIDs by potassium application or electrical stimulation results in larger infarct volumes [2,3]. On the other hand, administration of
glutamate receptor blockers or hypothermia, which reduce PIDs, have a
neuroprotective effect [6,13,24,36]. The basis for the relationship between PIDs and infarct growth may be an abnormal microvascular vasoconstriction in response to the depolarizations as well as an imbalance
between increased metabolic workload, induced by the depolarizations,
and delivery of oxygen and glucose to cerebral cells in the penumbra
[14,33].

in part, its effect by reducing recurrent spreading depolarizations.
Nevertheless we cannot exclude that cathodal tDCS reduces infarct
size by other mechanisms. Cortical, continuous, low-frequency electrical stimulation in a transitory MCA occlusion model had antiapoptotic,
anti-inﬂammatory and angiogenic effects [1]. Cathodal tDCS reduces
cortical glutamate, and downregulates the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2B in healthy mice [31]. In the transitory MCA occlusion
model in the mouse cathodal tDCs, applied in the early phase of stroke,
reduced the number of apoptotic neuronal cells and postischemic
inﬂammatory reaction (Petruzzoli-Jannetti et al.2013).
PIDs start in rats soon after MCA occlusion and recur through 40 h in
a biphasic pattern: an initial phase lasting about 3 h and a secondary
phase predominating at 8–18 h which was demonstrated to be even
more important for the recruitment of penumbral tissue into the infarct
core. [13]. Peruzzotti-Jametti et al. [31] showed that delaying of 4.5 h the
onset of tDCS after the induction of ischemia induced only a slight, not
signiﬁcant, reduction of the infarct volume. Therefore it seems crucial
to start cathodal tDCS as soon as possible after the induction of the ischemia. Moreover to explore the full extent of neuroprotective effect a
24 hour experiment of stimulation in freely behaving animals should
be performed [13].
Moving from bench to bedside, CSDs and PIDs have been recorded
also in patients with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction and
has been suggested that halting spreading depolarizations may help to
avoid the deterioration in these patients due secondary ischemia and
fatal brain edema [8,9,25].
In conclusion, although its mechanisms are far from being fully
elucidated, cathodal tDCS a non-invasive, easy to delivery, inexpensive,
method of brain excitability modulation, already employed in the experimental treatment of various neurological and psychiatric disorders,
seems to be a promising neuroprotective strategy in the very acute
phase of stroke treatment.

The relationships among PIDs, glutamate and growth of the infarcted
territory are debated.
Glutamate excitotoxicity is prominent in the early phase of ischemic
stroke and glutamate in the ischemic core may trigger PIDs that propagate in the penumbra causing an expansion of infarction [35]. On the
other hand it is possible that cell death in the penumbra occurs primarily as a consequence of metabolic stress and vasoconstriction induced by
PIDs whereas glutamate release and excitotoxicity are secondary to the
depolarizations [13]. Moreover the neuroprotective effect of a Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist may be attributable to block
of the spread of PIDs, which depends in part on glutamate receptors,
and not to a direct effect on glutamate-induced currents per se [13].
Whatever is the ﬁrst trigger of the complex cascade of events leading
to infarct expansion our ﬁndings indicate that cathodal tDCS blocks
the origin and the repeatedly spontaneous cycling of PIDs which are
thought to enlarge ischemic lesions [25]. In the present, as in other experimental studies, infarct size was correlated with the number of
SPCs [2,3,13,24]. Therefore we think that cathodal-tDCS exerts, at least
