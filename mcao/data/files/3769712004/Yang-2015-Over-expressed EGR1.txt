Over decades, more than 1000 therapeutics have been
attempted in treating ischemic stroke, but all these
eﬀorts were in vain (O’Collins et al., 2006), with intravenous rtPA remaining as the only exception (Liu, 2012).
A rational explanation for this odyssey fate lies in that
ischemia-triggered complex pathophysiological changes
in brain tissues may have neutralized the expected
actions and made treatment eﬀects negligible (Nour
et al., 2013). Although ischemia may start self-protection
within involved and nearby tissues by recruiting ‘‘good’’
factors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as an
example (Kokaia et al., 1995), ‘‘bad’’ factors, early growth
response 1 (EGR1) as an example, may be activated
simultaneously. These ‘‘bad’’ factors may exaggerate
ischemic injury and prevent recovery from ischemic
stroke (Honkaniemi et al., 1997).
As a member of immediate early genes, EGR1 is
widely expressed in the brain and sharply increased
after ischemic stroke (Milbrandt, 1987). Also known as
krox 24, zif 268, NGFI-A (Nerve growth factor-induced
protein A), EGR1 is a zinc-ﬁnger-like transcription factor
which can inﬂuence levels of local inﬂammation and neuronal damage after cerebral ischemia (Yi et al., 2007).
Previous studies observed that over-expression of
EGR1 regulated key cytokines in the transcriptional level
and resulted in secondary brain damage after cerebral
infarction (Tureyen et al., 2008). Infarct volumes in
EGR1 knockout mice were reduced substantially compared with those in EGR1 (+/+) mice (Tureyen et al.,
2008).
As a member of the neurotrophin family, BDNF plays
a fundamental role in protecting the brain against
ischemia. The protective functions of BDNF have been
related to neurogenesis and neuroplasticity (Zhu et al.,
2011). Under-expression of BDNF may suppress neuron
diﬀerentiation and maturation (Waterhouse et al., 2012);
while over-expression of BDNF may promote angiogenesis and protect ischemia-endangered neurons (Guan
et al., 2012). Exogenous BDNF has been shown to
reduce infarct volumes and improve neurological functions after stroke (Chang et al., 2013; Jeong et al.,
2014). Blocking endogenous BDNF by injecting TrkB-Fc
(chimeric Fc portion of the Tryosine receptor kinase B)
into ventricle may result in extra neuron death after global
forebrain ischemia (Larsson et al., 1999).

Abstract—Purpose: This study aimed to clarify whether
ischemia-induced early growth response 1 (EGR1) inﬂuenced the outcomes of experimental stroke by regulating
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression.
Methods and results: To mimic ischemia, mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion, and neurons
challenged with oxygen–glucose deprivation. The expression of EGR1 was increased immediately and reached the
peak 24 h after reperfusion. To increase and to decrease
EGR1 expressions, two types of recombinant lentiviruses
were constructed. EGR1 over-expression induced by recombinant lentiviruses expanded infarct volumes and increased
the numbers of terminal deoxynucleoitidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Fluoro-Jade
C-positive cells; while decreased EGR1 expression induced
by recombinant lentiviruses diminished infarct volumes
and decreased the numbers of TUNEL- and Fluoro-Jade Cpositive cells. Both in vitro and in vivo, increasing EGR1
expression with recombinant lentiviruses lead to decreased
BDNF expressions; while silencing EGR1 expression with
recombinant lentiviruses lead to increased BDNF expressions. Results from electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that EGR1 inﬂuenced the BDNF expression by binding
to its promoter.
Conclusion: Ischemia-induced EGR1 expression may exaggerate brain injury by reducing BDNF expression. Inhibiting
EGR1 may become a potential treatment for improving
outcomes of ischemic stroke. Ó 2015 IBRO. Published by

Structurally, EGR1 contains highly homologous DNAbinding domains with three zinc ﬁngers (Swirnoﬀ and
Milbrandt, 1995), which can recognize and bind GC-rich
regions (50 -G(C/A)GGGGG(C/A)GGGG-30 ) in the promoters of target genes (Kubosaki et al., 2009). Considering the
fact that a GC-rich region locates in the promoter of the
BDNF gene (UCSC, 2014), it is rational to presume that this
GC-rich region may be recognized and bound by EGR1,
and then regulate the expression of BDNF. Therefore,
BDNF and EGR1, one ‘‘good’’ factor and one ‘‘bad’’ factor,
may interact with each other in brain tissues after ischemia.
To test this hypothesis, we designed this study to determine whether EGR1 inﬂuenced the neurological functions
after focal ischemia by interfering with BDNF expression.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Lentivirus reconstruction
Lentiviral shRNA vectors targeting EGR1 gene were
purchased from GenePharma (GenePharma, China).
Human EGR1 gene was ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned
into pLVX-IRWS-Neo (Clontech Laboratories, USA).
Lentiviruses were constructed as previously described
with minor modiﬁcations (Eerola et al., 2013). Brieﬂy,
human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were
seeded at a density of 1  108/ml and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen,
USA) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Invitrogen) over
night. Lenti-X HTX Packaging Mix was cotransfected with
the shRNA, EGR1 over-expressed or control vectors into
human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T cells).
The supernatant was harvested 48 h later followed by
determination of titer. The lentiviruses were stored at
80 °C until use.
Animal
Adult male C57BL/6 mice weighing 20–23 g were provided
by the Model Animal Research Institute of the Nanjing
University (Nanjing, China). The mice were housed under
a controlled environment with alternative light–dark cycles,
relative humidity of approximately 60%, and ambient
temperature of 25 °C. All eﬀorts were made to minimize
animal suﬀering. The experiments were performed in
accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH
Publications No. 80–23, revised 1996). All procedures
were approved by the Animal Care Committee (Institute of
Science and Technology, Jiangsu Province, China).
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
MCAO model was established according to our previous
protocol (Wu et al., 2013). After anesthesia, a siliconcoated 6–0 nylon monoﬁlament was inserted through
the right common carotid into the internal carotid and
advanced to the origin of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). A laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (PeriFlux 5010; Perimed AB, Sweden) was used to conﬁrm the blood ﬂow
decline to 25% of the baseline. The ﬁlament was withdrawn 90 min later. Sham-operated mice underwent the
same procedures without the insertion of the ﬁlament.

Anal temperature was maintained at 37 °C using a heating pad during the surgery.
Primary neuron culture and oxygen–glucose
deprivation (OGD)
Primary neuron culture was performed according to our
previous protocol (Jiang et al., 2012). In brief, fetal mice
(Day 16–17) were euthanatized and brains were transferred to Hank’s-Buﬀered Saline Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen, USA). The cortical tissues were sectioned as
approximately 1-mm3 slices and then incubated with
0.125% trypsin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C. After terminating
the trypsinization with 10% FBS/DMEM, the mixture was
transferred to a new 15 ml tube. The supernatant was ﬁltered into a petri dish by a 100-lm cell strainer followed
by brief centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in
10% FBS/DMEM. For immunocytochemistry, 1  106
cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips.
For western blotting, 1  106 cells were seeded on polyL-lysine-coated 6-well dishes. After 2 h, the neurons were
cultured in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) containing
2% B27 (Invitrogen) and 1% Glutamax (Invitrogen). Then
half of the medium was replaced every three days. As for
OGD, 48 h after lentiviral infection, neurons were cultured
with glucose-free DMEM in an anaerobic chamber at
37 °C for 2 h. Then the medium was replaced by Neurobasal containing 2% B27 and 1% Glutamax.
Administration of recombinant lentivirus
Administration of recombinant lentivirus was applied
following our previous protocol (Jiang et al., 2012). In brief,
mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame. Stereotaxic injection was performed following coordinates: 0.8 mm posterior to bregma, 1.6 mm lateral to midline and 3.5 mm
ventral to the skull surface. Mice in control and sham
groups were given 5 ll DMEM at a speed of 0.5 ll/min.
Mice in LV-control/lentivirus of over-expressed EGR1
(LV-EGR1)/lentivirus of silenced EGR1 (LV-shEGR1)
group were given 1  108 PFU LV-control/LV-EGR1/
LV-shEGR1 suspended in 5 ll DMEM. After injections,
the needles were retained in place for at least 5 min.
Determination of infarct volumes
The infarct volumes were assessed by 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma–Aldrich)
staining. Mice were sacriﬁced 24 h after reperfusion. Then
the whole brains were gently removed and cut into 1-mm
sections. Then brain sections were immediately dipped
into 2% TTC for 10 min at 37 °C in the dark. The sections
were scanned and the infarct area of each brain was
measured in a blinded manner using the Image J software.
Western blotting
Total protein was extracted from cells or brain tissues using
RIPA lysis buﬀer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
Massachusetts, USA). Concentrations of samples were
determined by BCA assay (Beyotime, Shanghai, China),
loaded into 10% or 12% SDS–PAGE gels,
electrophoresed and transferred to a PVDF membrane

L. Yang et al. / Neuroscience 290 (2015) 509–517

(Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, USA). The membrane was
blocked by 5% milk for 2 h at room temperature followed by
incubation with primary antibody in blocking buﬀer at 4 °C
over night. These primary antibodies were rabbit antiEGR1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) and rabbit
anti-BDNF (ab101747 is speciﬁc for mature BDNF,
14 kDa) (1:1000, abcam, UK). The pro-form (32–35 kDa)
BDNF may be deleterious by inducing apoptosis through
P75NTR signaling, whereas mature BDNF (14 kDa) may
be neuroprotective and neuroplastic through trkB
activation. BDNF in this study was limited to mature
BDNF. Rabbit anti-b-actin (1:3000, Cell Signaling
Technology) was used as loading control. The secondary
antibody was anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibody
(1:4000, Cell Signaling Technology). The membrane was
developed with ECL Western blotting detection system
(Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA).

0.06% potassium permanganate solution for 10 min.
Then slides were then transferred to 0.0001% working
solution of FJC for 15 min. After the processes of
washing and drying, slides were cleared in xylene and
cover-slipped with non-ﬂuorescent mounting media.

TUNEL staining
Terminal deoxynucleoitidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed by
using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kt, AP (Roche,
Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s manual. Slides were immersed in 4%
PFA for 20 min followed by 15% glacial acetic acid for
2 min. The slides were then incubated with the reaction
solution at 37 °C for 2 h followed by converter-AP for
30 min. After washing and slightly drying, slides were
mounted onto glass slides with CC/MOUNT.

Histology
Mice were anesthetized 24 h after reperfusion and
intracardially perfused with saline followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA, pH 7.4). Brains were removed
and post-ﬁxed with 4% PFA at 4 °C for 2–4 h, and then
dehydrated in gradient sucrose solutions of 10%, 20%
and 30%. The brains were then embedded in an optimal
cutting temperature compound and cut into 10-lm
cryosections, which were collected onto poly-L-lysinecoated slides.
Fluoro-Jade C staining (FJC)
FJC was performed according to the manufacturer’s
manual (Millipore). Brain sections were sequentially
immersed in basic alcohol solution (1% NaOH in 80%
ethanol) for 5 min, in 70% ethanol for 2 min, and in

Immunoﬂuorescence
After post-ﬁxing in 4% PFA (pH 7.4), slides were immersed
in 0.1% Triton followed by 5% albumin bovine (Generay
biotech, China) incubation for 1 h. For immunoﬂuoresce
nce staining, two primary antibodies, rabbit anti-EGR1
(1:100, abcam) and sheep anti-BDNF (1:100, abcam),
were used. Slides were incubated with primary antibodies
diluted in antibody diluent reagent solution (Invitrogen) at
4 °C over night. Then slides were incubated with ﬂuoresc
ent-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room
temperature (Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit,
Alexa 647-conjugated donkey anti-sheep, Invitrog en).
After being counterstained with DAPI (1:1000, Sigma,
Saint Louis, Missouri), the slides were coverslipped with
CC/MOUNT.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
Nuclear extracts were prepared using NE-PERTM Nuclear
and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Thermo,
Rockford, Illinois, USA). EMSA was performed as
previously described with proper modiﬁcations (Jiang
et al. 2010). In brief, EMSA was carried out using LithtShiftTM Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Thermo) to assay
the binding site between EGR1 and BDNF promoter.
The EGR1 oligonucleotide probe, 50 -ATAGGAGGGGG
AGGGGACCT-30 , was end-labeled with biotin. Protein–
DNA-binding assays were performed with 10 lg of
nuclear protein. Probe and nuclear protein were incubated in binding buﬀer. For supershift, anti-EGR1
(abcam) was added to the binding buﬀer containing
nuclear protein before the probe. Samples were
incubated at room temperature and then separated by

electrophoresis with 6.5% polyacrylamide gel. Then
the binding reactions were transferred to a nylon
membrane. After the membrane was crosslinked, chemiluminescence was performed to detect biotin-labeled
DNA.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP was performed using an assay kit (Millipore) as
previously described with minor modiﬁcations (Yan
et al., 2014). Brieﬂy, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde solution for 10 min at 37 °C, and then harvested and
subjected to sonication. An aliquot was saved as total
input DNA after being diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution
buﬀer. Sheared chromatin was incubated with antiEGR1 antibody (Santa Cruz, #sc588), control IgG
(abcam) or antibody-free solution followed by Protein A

agarose/salmon sperm DNA (50% slurry). To analyze
immune-precipitated DNA, PCR ampliﬁcation was performed with primers of BDNF promoter: sense: 50 -TCACAGAAGGCATTAAGGAAGTA-30 , antisense: 50 -GGAT
GAGTTTGAAGAACATTAGC-30 . The products were analyzed with a 1% agarose gel and with real-time PCR to
assess the ampliﬁcation of the BDNF promoter.
Statistical analysis
Parameter data were presented as mean ± SD.
Diﬀerences between groups were assessed using
Student’s t-test or a one-way ANOVA followed by LSD
post hoc test (parametric data) or Kruskal–Wallis test
(nonparametric data). The signiﬁcance was considered
as P < 0.05/n (n = number of comparisons). All
statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS
22.0 software.

RESULTS
Expression of EGR1 after cerebral ischemia
The protein was extracted from brain ischemic
hemisphere at diﬀerent time points after reperfusion.
Compared with those of the normal brain tissues, the
EGR1 levels in brains of treated mice increased
signiﬁcantly, and reached a peak 24 h after reperfusion
as shown by western blotting (Fig. 3A and F). A large
number of neurons with over-expressed EGR1, as
shown by immunoﬂuorescence, were observed in the
peri-infarct cortex (Fig. 5). In vitro, OGD also induced
EGR1 expression in primary neurons (Fig. 3A and B).
Eﬀects of over-expressed EGR1 on infarct volumes
To evaluate the eﬀects of EGR1 on the infarct volumes,
we constructed two types of lentiviruses, LV-EGR1 and

Fig. 3. In vitro and in vivo expression of EGR1 and BDNF after ischemia. (A) Western blotting was used to evaluate the expression levels of EGR1
and BDNF after ischemia. In vivo, brain tissues were extracted at 4 h, 24 h and 48 h after MCAO (F and G) and 24 h after MCAO with previous viral
injection (D and E). Both EGR1 and BDNF expression were increased after focal cerebral ischemia in mice or oxygen–glucose deprivation in
neurons. EGR1 expression began to increase at 4 h after reperfusion and reached a peak at 24 h (F). Increased expression of BDNF was observed
at 24 h and sustained to 48 h after reperfusion (G). In vitro, cultured cells were harvested 2 h after OGD with previous viral application. EGR1 was
signiﬁcantly increased in LV-EGR1-treated neurons (B), and in brain tissues of LV-EGR1-treated mice (D), compared to sham, DMEM control, LV
control and LV-shEGR1 groups. BDNF under-expression detected in LV-EGR1 group and over-expression detected in LV-shEGR1 group (C, E).

LV-shEGR1, which can over- and under-express EGR1
respectively. The expressions of EGR1 in brain tissues
were detected by western blotting 7 days after
intraventricular injection of lentiviruses (Fig. 1A, C, D).
The MCAO model was developed 6 days after
intraventricular injection. The infarct volume was
assessed by TTC staining 24 h after reperfusion
(Fig. 2A). When evaluating the eﬀects of interventions
with recombinant lentiviruses, two types of controls were
applied, DMEM controls (MCAO + DMEM) and lentivirus
controls (LV controls) (MCAO + LV-control). Injection of
LV-EGR1 signiﬁcantly increased the infarct volumes
after MCAO compared with DMEM controls (MCAO +
LV-EGR1 vs. MCAO + DMEM: 26.93 ± 3.98% vs.
20.61 ± 2.38%, P < 0.05, Fig. 2A and B), and with LV
controls (MCAO + LV-EGR1 vs. MCAO + LV-control:
26.93 ± 3.98% vs. 21.13 ± 1.39%, P < 0.05, Fig. 2A
and B). When the EGR1 expression was inhibited by
LV-shEGR1, the infarct volumes were reversed as
compared with DMEM controls (13.54 ± 3.43% vs.
20.61 ± 2.38%, P < 0.05, Fig. 2A and B) and LV
controls (13.54 ± 3.43% vs. 21.13 ± 1.39%, P < 0.05,
Fig. 2A and B).

Eﬀects of over-expressed EGR1 on neuron injury
FJC staining and TUNEL assay were performed to
assess the eﬀects of EGR1 expression on neuron injury.

Injection
of
over-expressed
EGR1
lentiviruses
remarkably increased the numbers of FJC-positive cells
in the peri-infarct areas compared with DMEM controls
and LV controls. Injection of LV-shEGR1 reversed this
trend (Fig. 2C). The TUNEL assay showed similar
results (Fig. 2D). Lentiviruses were also used to infect
the primary neurons cultured in vitro. The EGR1
expression levels after infections are shown in Fig. 1A,
E, F. OGD was performed 48 h after infection to mimic
ischemic injury. TUNEL staining performed 24 h after
OGD showed that, more TUNEL-positive cells were
observed in the LV-EGR1-treated group and less in the
LV-shEGR1-treated group as compared with the DMEM
control and LV control groups (Fig. 2E).

Inﬂuences of over-expressed EGR1 on expression of
BDNF
The elevated BDNF induced by ischemia was identiﬁed
in vitro (Fig. 3A, C) and in vivo (Fig. 3A, G). A near
inverse relationship between EGR1 and BDNF
expressions was observed in the primary neurons
(Fig. 1A, E, F), and in brain tissues under diﬀerent
treatments (Fig. 1A, C and D). Furthermore, the
elevated BDNF after ischemia was reversed by
LV-EGRl, and enhanced by LV-shEGR1 in vitro (Fig. 3A
and C) and in vivo (Fig. 3A and E). As detected by
immunoﬂuorescence staining, the over-expressed EGR1

shown by immunocytochemical analysis. When transfected with LV-EGR1, EGR1 expression increased, but BDNF expression decreased. When
transfected with LV-shEGR1, EGR1 expression decreased, but BDNF expression increased. Scale bar = 10 lm.

injected, EGR1 expression increased, but BDNF expression decreased. When LV-shEGR1 was injected, EGR1 expression decreased, but BDNF
expression increased. Scale bar = 10 lm.

was co-localized with under-expressed BDNF in the
primary neurons (Fig. 4). While the EGR1 expression
was suppressed by LV-shEGR1 infection in some
primary neurons, the BDNF expression was increased
in the same cells (Fig. 4). When the viruses were
injected into the brains, similar trends were observed
(Fig. 5).
Interactions between EGR1 and BDNF
Results of EMSA and ChIP assay conﬁrmed that EGR1
could bind to the promoter and decrease the expression
of BDNF (Fig. 6). The shift band was identiﬁed as a
result of the EGR1-binding sequence (a positive
control), which was likely generating from EGR1 binding
to the probe (Fig. 6A, lane 2). The signal of this band
was successfully inhibited by the unlabeled probe and
blocked by the antibody of EGR1 (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and
4). ChIP assay was performed using EGR1 antibody or
non-speciﬁc IgG (Fig. 6B, C). Real-time PCR was
conducted to amplify the promoter of BDNF which was
found in the immunocomplex pulled down by the EGR1
antibody (Fig. 6B, lane 3), but not present in the
precipitation that was pulled down by the non-speciﬁc
IgG or when no antibody was added (Fig. 6B, lanes 5
and 4). Strong ampliﬁcation of the BDNF promoter was
found in precipitated complex which was pulled down by

the EGR1 antibody (Fig. 6C). What is shown in Fig. 6D
was that ischemia-induced EGR1 interacted with the
promoter of BDNF and then interfered with the
transcription of BDNF.

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrated that EGR1 was
increased immediately after stroke and sustained for at
least 48 h. Over-expression of EGR1 exaggerated
ischemic injury in vitro and in vivo. By binding to the
promoter of BDNF gene, EGR1 attenuated the
neuroprotective eﬀects of BDNF.
The expression level of EGR1 in the normal brain is
relatively low, but a sharp increase can be induced by a
variety of stresses including ischemia (Lu et al., 2011).
In this study, a rapid increase of EGR1 expression was
observed in peri-infarct cortex as early as 4 h after reperfusion and sustained for at least 48 h. In vitro, the EGR1
expression was also increased after OGD treatment in
primary neurons. These results were inconsistent with
some previous studies, in which up-regulations of EGR1
expression were observed in the rat brain several hours
after ischemia (Honkaniemi et al., 1997; Johansson
et al., 2000). Others even observed elevated EGR1
expression in the brain 5 days after ischemia (Tureyen
et al., 2008).

Fig. 6. EGR1 binding to the promoter of BDNF. EMSA was
performed to analyze the interaction between EGR1 and BDNF in
primary neurons 24 h after OGD (Fig. 6A). A shift band in the lane
with nuclear extracts and biotin-labeled DNA indicated EGR1 binding
to probe DNA (Fig. 6A, lane 2). This binding was inhibited by the
unlabeled probe (Fig. 6A, lane 3), and was supershifted by the EGR1
antibody (Fig. 6A, lane 4). ChIP was performed to further clarify the
interaction between EGR1 and the BDNF promoter. The qPCR
products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining of a 1%
agarose gel (Fig. 6B). NTC: no template control. Input: 100% input
sample. A non-speciﬁc IgG control (IgG) and a control without
antibody (No Ab) were included to measure background enrichment.
Quantitative analysis was performed using real-time PCR, and data
were normalized to the input DNA (Fig. 6C). Induced EGR1 interacted
with the speciﬁc location in the promoter of BDNF, and subsequently
aﬀected the transcription of the BDNF (Fig. 6D). Columns represent

Our data indicated that pre-treatment with LV-EGR1,
a reconstructed lentivirus which can increase the
expression of EGR1, signiﬁcantly enlarged infarct
volumes, and increased the numbers of denatured and
apoptotic cells. On the other hand, pre-treatment with
LV-shEGR1, a reconstructed lentivirus which can
decrease the expression of EGR1, signiﬁcantly
diminished infarct volumes, and decreased the numbers
of denatured and apoptotic cells. These results were
also supported by other studies, in which enlarged
infarct volumes were observed in EGR1 transgenic
mice, and diminished infarct volumes were observed in
EGR1 knock-out mice (Tureyen et al., 2008).
As a transcription factor, EGR1 involves in many
pathophysiological processes, such as inﬂammation
(Yan et al., 2000; Yi et al., 2007). EGR1 usually functions

by binding seed sequences to promoters of the target
genes. Although EGR1 expressions increase sharply
after stroke, its target genes, unfortunately, have not been
identiﬁed to date. The bioinformatics indicated that the
BDNF gene contains the speciﬁc domain in the promoter
that can be recognized and bound by EGR1. Our data, for
the ﬁrst time, indicated that EGR1 decreased BDNF
expression by binding to the promoter of the BDNF gene
in the brain tissues after ischemic reperfusion.
As an eﬃcacious neurotrophic factor, BDNF has been
expected as a potential therapeutic for ischemic stroke.
Studies have conﬁrmed that exogenous or overexpressed BDNF could decrease lesion areas and
improve neurological outcomes after focal ischemia
(Jiang et al., 2010; Jeong et al., 2014). BDNF could promote the survival of new neurons arising from adult rats
(Kirschenbaum and Goldman, 1995) and exert anti-apoptotic eﬀects after ischemia (Guan et al., 2012). A delayed
and sustained increase implies that ischemia-triggered
BDNF expression may participate in post-stroke brain
plasticity which may facilitate motor recovery (Madinier
et al., 2013). This study also demonstrated that expression of BDNF increased signiﬁcantly at 24 h and 48 h after
ischemic reperfusion.
Therefore, both expressions of EGR1 and BDNF were
elevated after ischemia, but played completely opposite
roles. In this study, the results of lentiviral interventions
indicated that increased EGR1 expression could
depress BDNF expression, and vice versa. EGR1 owns
three zinc ﬁnger DNA-binding domains that can
recognize and bind to GC-rich regions of the target
genes, and then aﬀects the related functions in
transcriptional level (Russo et al., 1995; Levkovitz and
Baraban, 2002; Zhang et al., 2003). This study conﬁrmed
that BDNF expression was also suppressed via EGR1 by
binding to its promoter.
Although increased BDNF expression may induce
protective eﬀects after ischemic stroke, the quantity may
be insuﬃcient (Guan et al., 2012). Simultaneously
increased EGR1 expression may further depress BDNF
expression, and attenuate its neuroprotective eﬀects.
Our study, therefore, provided a potential approach to
improve the outcomes of stroke via modulating the
expression of EGR1.

CONCLUSION
This study indicated that ischemia-induced EGR1
expression may exaggerate brain injury by reducing
BDNF expression. Inhibiting EGR1 may become a
potential therapeutic for ischemic stroke.
