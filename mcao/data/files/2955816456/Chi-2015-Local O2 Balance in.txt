Background: Most anesthetics affect cerebral blood flow and metabolism. We
compared microregional O2 balance in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion during pentobarbital and isoflurane anesthesia. Methods: After 1 hour of middle cerebral artery
occlusion and a 2-hour reperfusion under isoflurane (1.4%, n 5 14) or pentobarbital
(50 mg/kg, n 5 14) anesthesia in rats, regional cerebral blood flow using 14C-iodoantipyrine autoradiography, microregional arterial and venous O2 saturation
(20-60 mm in diameter) using cryomicrospectrophotometry, and the size of cortical
infarct were determined. Results: Ischemia–reperfusion decreased the average
cortical venous O2 saturation in both pentobarbital and isoflurane groups
(P , .0001), which was higher (P , .05) with pentobarbital despite a similar
average regional cerebral blood flow and O2 consumption. The heterogeneity
of venous O2 saturation reported as a coefficient of variation (100 3 standard deviation/mean) was smaller (P , .005) with pentobarbital than that with isoflurane (7.5 versus 16.1). The number of veins with low venous O2 saturation
(,50%) was smaller (P , .005) with pentobarbital (5 of 80 versus 24 of 80). The
percentage of cortical infarct in total cortex was smaller with pentobarbital
(5.2 6 2.5% versus 12.3 6 2.6%, P , .001). Conclusions: In the cerebral
ischemic–reperfused cortex, the average venous O2 saturation was higher, and
its heterogeneity and the number of veins with low O2 saturation were smaller
under pentobarbital than isoflurane anesthesia. This improvement in microregional O2 balance with pentobarbital was accompanied by the reduced cortical
infarct. Our data suggest that the neurologic outcome could vary during cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion depending on the anesthetics used. Key Words:
isoflurane—pentobarbital—cerebral blood flow and metabolism—cerebral O2
supply/consumption balance—cerebral venous O2 saturation—ischemia/
reperfusion injury/neuroprotection.

Various anesthetic agents are known to produce various
effects on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebral
metabolism in normal and in ischemic brain.1-3 However,
it is not clear how they affect microregional O2 balance
in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion.

In the brain, O2 supply is well balanced with O2
demand globally or regionally. At the microregional level,
however, the O2 supply and consumption balance is
heterogeneous. Previous studies have reported heterogeneity of microregional oxygenation, tissue O2 tension, and

ANESTHETICS ON BRAIN O2 BALANCE IN REPERFUSION

O2 saturation of small veins in the normal and in the
ischemic or ischemic-reperfused area.4-7 Our previous
study showed a decrease of average microregional
venous O2 saturation (SvO2) after 1-hour ischemia and
2-hour reperfusion, despite return of rCBF.4 We recently
reported that dexmedetomidine could improve microregional O2 balance and decrease the size of infract without
significant changes in average SvO2 in the ischemicreperfused cortex (IR-C).8 We are still continually investigating the relationship between microregional O2 balance
and the size of infarct using several agents that possibly affect the microregional O2 balance in cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion. We hypothesize that the presence
of smaller number of microregional veins with low O2
saturation may be beneficial for survival of neurons in
focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion even if with similar
average microregional SvO2. Microregional O2 balance
in ischemia–reperfusion could be altered by various
experimental conditions including anesthesia, which
is routinely needed during surgery for humans and
animals.
General anesthesia has been known to produce neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia compared with awake
condition.9-11 It has been reported that barbiturates
are neuroprotective in focal cerebral ischemia in
experimental animals although no definite advantage in
neuroprotection has been reported clinically.10-14 One of
the main mechanisms of neuroprotection by barbiturates
is known to reduce cerebral metabolism.1,13 Compared
with barbiturates, isoflurane failed to demonstrate
superior neuroprotective effects during focal cerebral
ischemia.11,12,14 It has been shown that in focal cerebral
ischemia, the rCBF was lower, and the O2 consumption
appears lower with pentobarbital than that with
isoflurane anesthesia at the end of 1 hour of middle
cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion.1
In this study, we hypothesized that the microregional
O2 balance in the cerebral ischemic-reperfused area
would be better with pentobarbital compared with
isoflurane anesthesia, and the improved microregional
O2 balance could be associated with the smaller size of
cortical infarcts. To test this hypothesis, microregional
arterial O2 saturation (SaO2) and SvO2 (diameter,
20-60 mm) were determined with cryomicrospectrophotometry and rCBF was determined with autoradiography
in the alternate slices of brain tissue. The size of cortical
infarct was determined with tetrazolium staining at the
end of 2-hour reperfusion.

Materials and Methods
This study was approved by our Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee and was conducted in accordance to US Public Health Service Guidelines using the
Guide for the Care of Laboratory Animals (DHHS Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).

Twenty-eight male Fischer 344 rats weighing 240-280 g
were used to measure rCBF and microscopic SaO2 and
SvO2 and size of cortical infarct after 1 hour of MCA
occlusion and 2 hours of reperfusion. Rats were randomly
assigned to 2 groups. The rats were initially anesthetized
with 2% isoflurane in an air and oxygen mixture (isoflurane group, n 5 14) or 50 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital
intraperitoneally (pentobarbital group, n 5 14) and
were mechanically ventilated through a tracheal tube. A
femoral artery and vein were cannulated. The venous
catheter was used to administer radioactive tracer and
normal saline. The artery catheter was connected to
Statham P23Db pressure transducer (Gulton-Statham,
Rochester, NY) and an iWorx data acquisition system
(iWorx Systems, Dover, NH) to monitor heart rate and
blood pressure. This catheter was also used to obtain arterial blood samples for analysis of hemoglobin (Hb), blood
gases, and pH using a Radiometer blood gas analyzer
ABL80 (Radiometer America, Westlake, OH). The isoflurane concentration was maintained at 1.4% after MCA
occlusion (isoflurane group). In the pentobarbital group,
additional pentobarbital (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally)
was administered every 40-50 minutes after the initial
dose. Body temperature was monitored and maintained
at 37 6 .5 C with a servo-controlled rectal thermistor
probe and a heating lamp. Temporalis muscle temperature was monitored as a representative pericranial
temperature using a thermocouple probe (Omega Engineering, Inc., Stamford, CT), and it averaged 37 C.
The transient occlusion of MCA using an intraluminal
thread was performed to study cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion as previously described.4,8,15,16 The common
carotid artery was exposed through a midline ventral
cervical incision and carefully separated from the
adjacent nerve. Then a 4.0 monofilament thread with its
tip covered with silicon was inserted into the stump of
the external carotid artery and advanced approximately
1.7 cm into the internal carotid artery until resistance
was felt. The filament was held in place for 60 minutes
blocking the MCA. The filament was then removed,
allowing reperfusion, and the external carotid artery
was closed. Measurements were performed after
120 minutes of reperfusion. In the randomly selected
8 animals in each group, rCBF and microscopic O2
saturations of small veins and arteries were determined
in the IR-C, contralateral cortex (CC), and pons. Six rats
in each group were used to determine the size of cortical
infarction.

Determination of rCBF
Using the 14C-iodoantipyrine quantitative autoradiographic technique, rCBF was measured as described
previously.4,8 Briefly, 40 mCi of 14C-iodoantipyrine was
infused intravenously. When the isotope entered the
venous circulation, the arterial catheter was cut to

O.Z. CHI ET AL.

20 mm to minimize smearing. Twenty blood samples
were obtained from the arterial catheter approximately
every 3 seconds during the next 60 seconds. At the
moment when the last sample was obtained, the animal
was decapitated and the head was frozen in liquid
nitrogen. While frozen, the brain was sampled from 3
regions: IR-C, CC, and pons. The brain samples were
sectioned (20 mm) on a microtome-cryostat, and the sections were exposed to X-ray film to obtain an autoradiogram. The cerebral 14C-iodoantipyrine concentrations
were determined with reference to 8 precalibrated standards (40-1069 nCi/g, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) using the NIH ImageJ program (www.NIH.
gov). For each brain region examined, a minimum of 8
optical density measurements were made, each on
different sections. Blood samples were placed in a tissue
solubilizer and 24 hours later put in a counting liquid.
These samples were counted on a liquid scintillation
counter and were quench corrected. Determinations of
rCBF were then calculated using equation published
previously.7,17

Determination of Microregional Arterial and Venous
O2 Saturation
As previously described, alternate sections of the brain
tissue used for determination of rCBF from the 3 brain
regions (IR-C, CC, and pons) were used for the determination of microregional SaO2 and SvO2.4,7,8,17 These
cortical sections were from an approximately 5-mm
plug taken from the parietal cortex over the MCA. Details
of this technique have been published previously.18,19
Briefly, the brain sections were cut into wafers at 220 C.
The regions were mounted with embedding medium in
a microtome-cryostat. Twenty-micrometer thick sections
were obtained at 235 C under a N2 atmosphere. The sections were transferred to precooled glass slides and
covered with degassed silicone oil and a coverslip. These
slides were placed on a microspectrophotometer fitted
with an N2-flushed cold stage to obtain readings of optical
density at 568, 560, and 523 nm. This 3-wavelength
method corrects for the light scattering in the frozen
blood. Only vessels in the transverse section were studied
so that the path of light traversed only the blood. The size
of the measuring spot was 8 mm in diameter. Readings
were obtained to determine O2 saturation in 5 arteries
and 10 veins (20-60 mm in diameter) in each region. Arterioles and venules were differentiated by the presence or
the absence of muscle layers.

Determination of O2 Supply, O2 Consumption, and
O2 Supply/Consumption Ratio
The O2 content of blood was determined by multiplying the percent O2 saturation by the Hb concentration
times 1.36, the maximal binding capacity of Hb for O2 per
gram. The difference between the average arterial and

venous O2 contents (regional O2 extraction) was then
obtained. Using the Fick principle, we calculated the O2
consumption for each region as the product of average
flow and O2 extraction. This method has been validated
in the brain.18 The ratio of O2 supply and consumption
in a region was determined by dividing local O2 supply
by local O2 consumption; CaO2 3 CBF/CBF (CaO2 2
CvO2) where CaO2 and CvO2 are the arterial and venous
O2 content and CBF is the rCBF. CaO2 or CvO2 was determined by multiplying SaO2 or SvO2 by Hb times 1.36, the
maximum binding capacity of Hb for O2 per gram. This
equation cancels out Hb, 1.36, and rCBF. This reduces to
SaO2/(SaO2 2 SvO2) where SaO2 and SvO2 are the
percent oxyhemoglobin in the arterial and venous blood,
respectively.

Determination of Size of Cortical Infarct
As described previously, to determine the size of
infarction, a tetrazolium staining was performed in
a blinded fashion as follows.8 A .05% solution of
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Sigma) solution in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was prepared and
warmed to 37 C. The brain was removed from the head
and sliced in coronal sections using a straightedge razor
blade. There were typically 3-4 slices of approximately
2-3–mm thickness each from each brain. The slices were
placed in the tetrazolium chloride solution and incubated
for 30 minutes. The tetrazolium chloride was then poured
off, and the slices were washed 3 times in PBS, 1 minute
per wash. Each slice was then placed in a small weighing
boat with PBS to keep it from drying out. The boat was
placed on a dissecting microscope and a clean slide was
placed over the weighing boat. The cortical region of
each slice was traced onto the slide using a .3-mm marker.
Any infarcted areas were marked by cross-hatching over
any areas not well marked with tetrazolium stain. The
slides were then scanned. The scanned images were
then measured for total and infarcted areas in the cortex
using ImageJ. Cortical infarcted areas are reported as
percent of total cortical area.

Statistical Analysis
Using the general linear model (PROC GLM) from the
SAS Institute (Cary, NC), a 2-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was performed for the various measurements
to assess the difference between the different regions
(used as a repeated measures within treatment) and treatments examined for hemodynamic, blood gases, cerebral
blood flow, and O2 balance parameters. Post hoc testing of
multiple comparisons was performed using Tukey’s procedure. An ANOVA was used to analyze the heterogeneity or variability of all measured SvO2 determined. The
coefficient of variation (CV) of SvO2 was also reported
to describe heterogeneity. The CV was calculated as
100 3 standard deviation (SD)/mean. A c2 test was also

used to assess the differences in the distribution of SvO2
and differences in the number of low O2 saturated veins
between groups. Nonpaired t test was used to assess the
difference in the size of infarct between the groups. A
value of P less than .05 was considered as statistically significant. All values are expressed as mean 6 SD.

Results
Hemodynamic and blood gas parameters in the pentobarbital and isoflurane groups of rats that were used for
determination of O2 balance parameters are shown in
Table 1. The mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and
heart rate were not significantly different between the 2
groups (Table 1.) Arterial blood gases, pH, and Hb were
similar between the 2 experimental groups. The hemodynamic and blood gas data were not significantly different
between anesthetics and the groups that were used for
O2 balance and for the size of cortical infarct.

Average rCBF, O2 Consumption, and Extraction
rCBF was not significantly different between the IR-C
and the CC or between the 2 groups (Fig 1, A).
The oxygen consumption was not significantly
different between the IR-C and the CC or between the 2
groups of rats (Fig 1, B). The oxygen extraction of the
IR-C was significantly elevated when compared with
the CC in the isoflurane group (126%, P , .01) and
in the pentobarbital group (116%, P , .005). There were
no significant differences in oxygen extraction between
the isoflurane and the pentobarbital group in either the
IR-C or the CC (Fig 1, C).

Microregional O2 Saturation
Arterial oxygen saturations were similar in all regions
and groups (Table 2). However, the average venous oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the IR-C when
compared with the CC in both the isoflurane (P , .0001)
and pentobarbital group (P , .0001). In the IR-C, the
average venous oxygen saturation of the pentobarbital
group was significantly higher than that of the isoflurane
group (Table 2, P , .05). The SvO2 was similar between
the 2 groups in the CC. The ratio of O2 supply and
consumption of the IR-C was significantly lower than
that of the corresponding CC in both the isoflurane
(P , .0001) and the pentobarbital group (P , .0001;
Table 2).

Heterogeneity of SvO2
The distribution of all measured SvO2 determined
was heterogeneous in both cortical regions in both groups
(Fig 2). There was a significant shift to lower values in the
IR-C when compared with the CC in both groups (isoflurane, P , .0001; pentobarbital, P , .0001). The distribution
of SvO2 was significantly shifted (P , .005) to higher

values with pentobarbital in the IR-C when compared
with the isoflurane group. The degree of heterogeneity
of SvO2 was analyzed by ANOVA and reported as
CV (CV 5 100 3 SD/mean) obtained from the distribution curve (Fig 2). Ischemia–reperfusion significantly
increased the heterogeneity of SvO2 in both groups
(P , .0001). Pentobarbital significantly decreased the heterogeneity of microregional SvO2 (P , .005) in the IR-C
when compared with the isoflurane group. The values
of CV were 16.1 and 5.8 for the IR-C and CC, respectively,
in the isoflurane group, and 7.5 and 6.3 for the pentobarbital group. The number of veins with oxygen saturation
below 50% was significantly less in the pentobarbital than
in the isoflurane group (5 of 80 versus 24 of 80, c2:
P , .005) in the IR-C.

with the pentobarbital than that with the isoflurane group
(5.2 6 2.5% versus 12.3 6 2.6%, P , .001).
We also compared the effects of the 2 anesthetics in O2
balance in the remote cerebral region, the pons. There
were no significant differences in the cerebral blood
flow (isoflurane: 138 6 50 versus pentobarbital: 102 6
25 mL/minute/100 g) in the pons between groups. The
oxygen extraction (isoflurane: 4.6 6 .6 versus pentobarbital: 4.8 6 .4 mL O2/100 mL) was also similar between
the 2 experimental groups in the pons. The oxygen consumption of the pons was also not significantly different
in comparison between the groups (isoflurane 6.3 6 2.3
versus pentobarbital 4.8 6 1.4 mL O2/min/100 g).

Discussion
Size of Cortical Infarct
The size of cortical infarct measured as percentage of
cortical infarct out of total cortical area determined at
the end of a 2-hour reperfusion was significantly smaller

Our data demonstrated that ischemia–reperfusion
decreased the average microregional SvO2 with increased
heterogeneity under both pentobarbital and isoflurane
anesthesia. In the IR-C, the average SvO2 was higher

microregional venous oxygen saturation.
In the ischemic-reperfused cortex, the heterogeneity of venous oxygen saturation
and the number of veins with oxygen saturation less than 50% were much smaller
with pentobarbital anesthesia despite
similar regional cerebral blood flow.

ANESTHETICS ON BRAIN O2 BALANCE IN REPERFUSION

with a remarkable decrease in the number of veins with
low O2 saturation and smaller heterogeneity during
pentobarbital than isoflurane anesthesia suggesting
improved microregional O2 balance with pentobarbital
anesthesia. The size of cortical infarct determined at 2
hours after reperfusion was also smaller with pentobarbital anesthesia.
Our data showed almost complete restoration of rCBF
with reperfusion in both groups as shown in other
studies.4,8,20 The rCBF of IR-C appeared lower than the
normal cortex but without a statistical significance in
both groups of animals. This slightly lowered rCBF could
have contributed to the increase in O2 extraction
decreasing the average SvO2 in the IR-C in both groups.
The O2 consumption was similar between the IR-C and
the CC in both groups. It is possible that in the IR-C
some of the neurons could be excited using more oxygen,
increasing O2 extraction, and decreasing SvO2 when
compared with the normal cortex in both groups. Our
data suggest that without alterations of overall rCBF
and O2 consumption, the microregional SvO2 or O2 balance could be heterogeneous.
In the equation for O2 supply/consumption ratio
described in the Materials and Methods section, it cancels
out rCBF, 1.36 and Hb. Because SaO2 is essentially constant and independent of ischemic status or regions, individual microregional SvO2 could reflect the final product
of microregional O2 supply and consumption balance.4,7,8
SvO2 variability in our study should represent the
heterogeneity of O2 supply/consumption ratio on
microregional basis. Our data on heterogeneity of SvO2
under isoflurane anesthesia in the IR-C is similar to our
previous reports.4 Increased heterogeneity was considerable (CV, 16.1 versus 5.8 under isoflurane anesthesia),
and pentobarbital lowered the heterogeneity (CV, 7.5) in
the IR-C.
Pathophysiologic reactions occur during ischemia–
reperfusion to affect local O2 supply/consumption
ratio. Irregular distribution of rCBF could be caused by
microvascular blockage, cellular edema, and activation
of various nitric oxide synthases.5,20,21 Neurons could be
excited, nonfunctioning, or normal producing various
ratios of O2 supply/consumption. These irregularities of
O2 supply/consumption ratio could cause heterogeneity
of microregional SvO2. Although the average microregional SvO2 is similar, the increase of the number of
individual microregional veins with low SvO2 would be
harmful for neuronal survival.
Pentobarbital has been known to decrease neuronal
excitation and O2 consumption and to produce electroencephalography suppression.1,2,13 Decrease in cerebral
metabolism has been considered as one of the main
mechanisms for neuronal protection. In contrast to
isoflurane, which cause cerebral vasodilatation, vasoconstriction produced by pentobarbital in the normal
cortex could have helped redistribute blood flow to the

1201

IR-C contributing to a more complete restoration of blood
flow to this region.2,22,23 The better restoration of rCBF and
lowering neuronal O2 consumption by pentobarbital
could have contributed to the higher average SvO2
lowering SvO2 heterogeneity and lowering the number
of small veins with low O2 saturation compared with the
isoflurane-anesthetized rats.
Our data suggest that pentobarbital anesthesia may be
a better choice for neuronal survival in the early stage of
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion than isoflurane at least in
the experimental animals. Pentobarbital anesthesia during early stage of ischemia–reperfusion period can
improve microregional O2 balance even without significantly affecting regional rCBF and O2 consumption. The
similar O2 consumption between 2 groups in the IR-C
could be because more neurons survived and used
more O2 in the pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Our data
suggest that this improved microregional O2 balance
could have contributed to the smaller size of cortical
infarction that was determined at the same time.
The precise mechanisms of neuroprotection with
barbiturates and isoflurane are not completely settled.
Decrease in cerebral metabolism has been known to be
one of the important mechanisms of neuroprotection for
both anesthetics.23-25 Some other mechanisms involved
in neuroprotection could be common for both pentobarbital and isoflurane such as reduced excitotoxicity
and increased gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor
activity.13,26-28 Various cellular and molecular mechanisms
of neuroprotection for anesthetics were reported.29-32
General anesthetics inhibit erythropoietin induction in
hypoxia.30 Isoflurane induced Akt activation and reduced
nuclear factor kB activation and interleukin 1b production
in cerebral ischemia.31,32 Equivalent reduction in cerebral
metabolism produced by hypothermia and by anesthetics
such as pentobarbital or isoflurane were not equivalent in
their effects on membrane failure.33 This suggests that
decreased metabolism is not the only parameter affecting
neurologic outcome.
This is the first study showing the possibility that
pentobarbital could decrease neuronal damage during
reperfusion through a linkage with improved microscopic O2 supply and consumption balance and reduced
number of veins with lower SvO2. It is possible that
agents, which decrease the number of veins with low O2
saturation, could decrease neuronal damage. The percentage of cortical infarcted area out of the total cortex was
significantly lower with pentobarbital anesthesia. In this
study, the size of cortical infarct was determined because
SvO2 was measured in the cortical microregions. This
decrease in the size of cortical infarct at 2 hours after reperfusion would not suggest a long-term effect of pentobarbital anesthesia. The infarct may not be completely
developed. Our data suggest that this improved microregional O2 supply/consumption balance reflected in the
decrease in the number of veins with low SvO2 could be

1202

one of the contributory factors deciding the size of infarct
in the acute stage of reperfusion, at least in the cortical
area. Although a number of studies showed neuroprotection by pentobarbital, another study reported that among
barbiturates, pentobarbital was not effective in neuroprotection.34 These different outcomes may be because of
various different experimental conditions.
Our data strongly suggest that the size of cerebral
infarction could vary depending on anesthetics used during the experimental period. It becomes necessary that
when data on the outcome of stroke are analyzed, various
anesthetics used and the depth and duration of anesthesia
for the experiment should be taken into account.
Minor differences in the MABP, rCBF, and Hb between
groups without a statistical significance could have
affected our data. The reported rCBF values are from
regions, not from microregions. However, the individual
SvO2 should represent the final product of the O2 supply
and consumption balance in these microregions including
the differences in rCBF, Hb, and MABP. The limitations
in our measurements of regional cerebral flow and
O2 extraction and consumption were reported previously.18,19 This technique is one of the few methods
of quantitatively, accurately, and rapidly estimating
cerebral O2 balance in small microregions of normal and
ischemic cortex with drainage fields of cerebral veins of
20-60 mm in diameter at a certain time point.
In conclusion, the present study showed that ischemia–
reperfusion lowered the average microregional SvO2 and
increased the heterogeneity under both of pentobarbital
and isoflurane anesthesia. The average microregional
SvO2 was higher and the number of veins with low O2
saturation and the heterogeneity of SvO2 were smaller
under the pentobarbital anesthesia than isoflurane anesthesia in the IR-C. Our major finding is that pentobarbital
improved microregional O2 balance in cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion. The size of cortical infarct was smaller with
pentobarbital that was determined at 2 hours of reperfusion. Our data suggest that this improved microregional
O2 supply/consumption balance with pentobarbital
anesthesia may have contributed to the decreased size
of cortical infarct during the early stage of reperfusion.
Anesthetics could be one of the important factors determining the outcome of stroke in the early stage of cerebral
