Abstract. Previous studies have reported that physical exercise may exert a neuroprotective effect in humans as well
as animals. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying
the neuroprotective effect of exercise has remained to be
elucidated. The aim of the present study was to explore the
possible signaling pathways involved in the protective effect of
pre‑ischemic treadmill training for ischemic stroke in rats. A
total of 36 male Sprague‑Dawley rats were divided at random
into three groups as follows (n=12 for each): Sham surgery
group; middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group; and
exercise with MCAO group. Following treadmill training
for three weeks, the middle cerebral artery was occluded
for 90 min in order to induce ischemic stroke, followed by
reperfusion. Following 24 h post‑reperfusion, six rats from
each group were assessed for neurological deficits and then
sacrificed to calculate the infarct volume. The remaining rats
(n=6 for each group) were sacrificed and the expression levels
of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT‑2) and extracellular signal‑regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) were detected
using western blot analysis. The results of the present study
demonstrated that rats that underwent pre‑ischemic exercise
intervention had a significantly decreased brain infarct volume
and neurological deficits; in addition, the pre‑ischemic exercise
group showed decreased overexpression of phosphorylated
ERK1/2 and increased expression of EAAT‑2 following ischemic stroke. In conclusion, treadmill training exercise prior to

ischemic stroke alleviated brain damage in rats via regulation
of EAAT‑2 and ERK1/2.
Introduction
Previous studies have demonstrated that physical exercise had
neuroprotective effects in animals following ischemic stroke,
including enhanced survival, decreased neurological deficits,
reduced blood‑brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and increased
neurovascular integrity (1‑5). However, the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of exercise have remained to
be elucidated.
Excessive release of glutamate has been confirmed to
have a key role in the process of brain damage following
ischemic stroke and is involved in the majority of ischemic
stroke‑associated brain injuries (6). A previous study
reported that three weeks of pre‑ischemic treadmill training
may ameliorate the increased release of glutamate (7) and
decrease messenger (m)RNA levels of metabotropic glutamate
receptor 5 and N‑methyl‑D‑aspartate receptor subunit
type 2B (8), which resulted in alleviation of the toxic effects of
excessive glutamate.
Glutamate transporters also have an important role in
glutamate re‑uptake, which contribute to the pathological
mechanisms of glutamate‑induced toxic injury. Five excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) have been identified
in the mammalian CNS, of which EAAT‑2 was an important
transporter for the regulation of extracellular glutamate
concentrations (9,10). Therefore, the hypothesis of the present
study was that pre‑ischemic exercise intervention promotes the
expression of EAAT‑2 so as to reduce brain damage following
ischemic stroke.
The extracellular signal‑regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)
pathway has been reported to have an important role in the
neuroprotective effect of exercise preconditioning (11).
ERK1/2 is a key subfamily of mitogen‑activated protein
kinases which regulate a broad range of cellular activities,
including the protection against cerebral ischemia (12).
Inhibition of the ERK1/2 pathway was previously reported to
decrease brain damage and infarct volume in mice following

ischemic stroke (13,14); in addition, another study showed that
following three weeks of pre‑ischemic exercise the expression
of phosphorylated (phospho)‑ERK1/2 was downregulated
48 h post‑reperfusion (11). However, the effect of pre‑ischemic
exercise on the expression of phospho‑ERK1/2 at 24 h
post‑reperfusion has remained to be elucidated.
The aim of the present study was to investigate whether
three weeks of exercise preconditioning reduced neurological deficits, infarct size as well as altered the expression of
phospho‑ERK1/2 and EAAT‑2.
Materials and methods
Animals. A total of 36 male Sprague‑Dawley rats
(weight, 200‑220g; age, 2 months) were provided by the Hebei
Province Laboratory Animal Center (Hebei, China). Rats were
housed under standard conditions in a 12‑h light/dark cycle,
with food and water available ad libitum. All procedures in
the present study were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Hebei Medical University (Hebei, China).
Treadmill training. Rats were divided at random into three
groups as follows (n=12 for each): Sham surgery group; middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group; and exercise with
MCAO group. Prior to formal training, rats in the exercise with
MCAO group were subjected to running exercise for three days
at a speed of 6‑7 m/min for 20 min per day using a treadmill
training machine (DSPT‑202 Type 5‑Lane Treadmill; Litai
Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Shishi, China). Following adaptive
exercise training, rats underwent formal exercise intervention
at a speed of 20 m/min for 30 min per day, six times per week.
Rats in the sham surgery and MCAO groups were enabled to
run freely in their cages in the corresponding period.
MCAO model. Following treadmill training, all rats underwent
MCAO or sham surgery. The MCAO model rats were anesthetized (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) using an intraperitoneal
injection of 4% chloral hydrate (10 ml/kg); further doses were
required if rats did not remain anesthetized during surgery. A
heating pad was used to maintain the rats' body temperature
at 37˚C. Surgical procedures were performed as previously
described by Longa et al (15).
In brief, the left common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid
artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed.
A suture (4‑0 nylon) with a rounded poly‑L‑lysine‑coated tip
(Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) was inserted
into the small incision in the ECA. The suture was then passed
through CCA and ICA to the origin section of the MCA in order
to occlude this artery. Following 90 minutes of occlusion, the
filament was removed to allow for reperfusion.
Rats in the sham group underwent the same procedures
without occlusion of MCA. The physiological parameters
of rats were determined using a Blood Gas and Electrolyte
System (ABL505; Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Rats
were evaluated 24 h following reperfusion in accordance with
a widely used scale as follows: 0, no neurological symptoms;
1, unable to completely extend the front jaw on the contralateral
side; 2, rotating while crawling and falling to the contralateral
side; 3, unable to walk without assistance; and 4, unconsciousness (15).

Determination of brain infarct volume. Following 24 h
post‑reperfusion, rats were anesthetized using chloral hydrate
(10%) and then sacrificed. Brain tissues were stored at ‑20˚C for
10 minutes, then the whole brain was divided evenly into six
coronal sections (2 mm) from the anterior pole to the optic chiasm
in the mid‑way. Brain sections were immediately dipped into a
2% 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution (Sigma‑Aldrich)
at 37˚C for 30 min and then ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde buffer
(Sigma, Muenchen, Germany). Following 24 h, the infarct area
was calculated according to the images captured using a digital
camera (DC240; Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA) and imaging
software (Adobe Photoshop 7.0; Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA,
USA). The infarction volume of whole brain was equal to the
sum of the infarct area in the six sections. In order to reduce
error due to brain edema, the corrected formula to calculate the
infarct volume was as follows (16): Infarct volume = contralateral hemisphere region ‑ non‑infarcted region in the ipsilateral
hemisphere; infarct percentage = (Infarct volume/volume of the
contralateral hemisphere)x100%.
Western blot analysis. Cortex brain tissue in proximity to
the ischemic area was examined. The protein of the brain
tissue was extracted using a protein extraction reagent (Pierce
Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). The extracted proteins
were purified by affinity chromatography and the concentration
of extracted protein was detected using the bicinchoninic acid
assay (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China).
Equal quantities (40 µg) of protein extract and sample buffer
were mixed completely and incubated in a 95˚C‑water bath
for 5 min prior to loading onto 10% polyacrylamide gels. The
proteins were delivered onto a HybondTM nylon membrane
(GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) at 350 V for 90 min with
a cold pack (at 0˚C). Proteins were then stored in 5% bovine
serum albumin blocking solution for 1 h at 25˚C and incubated
overnight at 40˚C with monoclonal rabbit anti‑ERK1/2 (dilution, 1:1,000), monoclonal rabbit anti‑phospo‑ERK1/2 (dilution,
1:1,000) or polyclonal rabbit anti‑EAAT‑2 antibodies (dilution,
1:1,000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA).
Protein was then incubated with horseradish peroxidase‑labeled
anti‑rabbit secondary antibodies (dilution, 1:100; Hua‑Mei
Biotech, Beijing, China) for 1 h at room temperature with
blocking buffer. The membrane was then visualized using the
enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare) for 5 min
and exposed to Kodak film (Kodak) for 5‑30 seconds. GAPDH
or β‑actin was used as a loading control.
Statistical analysis. SPSS version 15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago,
IL, USA) was used to perform data analysis. Neurological
deficit scores and infarct volumes between the MCAO and
exercise with MCAO groups were compared using Student's
t‑test. Relative image density among the three groups analyzed
using a one‑way analysis of variance was followed by a least
significant difference post‑hoc test. Data are presented as the
mean ± standard deviation. P<0.05 was considered to indicate
a statistically significant difference between values.
Results
Physiological variables are unchanged between the groups.
Physiological parameters were evaluated in rats from each

group; however, rats of the exercise with MCAO group showed
significantly decreased volumes of infarction compared with
those of the MCAO group (P<0.05) (Fig. 2).
Exercise reduces phospho‑ERK1/2 overexpression following
ischemic brain injury. Western blot analysis was used to
determine the protein levels of ERK1/2 and phospho‑ERK1/2
in rats from each group. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, total
ERK1/2 expression was not significantly different among the
three groups; however, there were significant differences in
phospho‑ERK1/2 expression levels among the three groups.
MCAO rats demonstrated increased phospho‑ERK1/2 expression compared to that of the sham surgery group (P<0.05);
in addition, the pre‑ischemic exercise group showed
decreased phospho‑ERK1/2 compared to that of the MCAO
group (P<0.05), indicating that pre‑ischemic exercise alleviated this effect.
EAAT‑2. As shown in Fig. 5, western blot analysis revealed
significant differences in EAAT‑2 protein expression among
the three groups (P<0.05). EAAT‑2 was markedly decreased

group and was markedly increased in the pre‑ischemic exercise group compared to that of the MCAO group (P<0.05).

pathway was involved in cerebral damage in the process of
cerebral ischemia (13‑14). Therefore, intervention which may
decrease the overexpression of phospho‑ERK1/2 following
ischemic stroke may alleviate ischemia‑induced damage.
In a previous study, the promotion of phospho‑ERK1/2
induced by exercise preconditioning was found to be neuroprotective (11). Another study demonstrated that pre‑ischemic
exercise decreased overexpression of phospho‑ERK1/2 at
48 hours following ischemia/reperfusion (8). The results of the
present study further confirm that exercise preconditioning
alleviated the overexpression of phospho‑ERK1/2 at 24 h
following ischemia/reperfusion.
In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated
that pre‑ischemic exercise exerted a neuroprotective effect
via the decreased overexpression of phospho‑ERK1/2 and
increased expression of EAAT‑2 following cerebral ischemia.
Further patient studies are required in order to confirm the
beneficial effect of pre‑ischemic exercise in humans; however,
it is encouraged that patients with a high risk of stroke exercise
regularly.

Discussion

References

Ischemic stroke is a prevalent cause of mortality in Western
countries (17); therefore, studies into the alleviation of brain
damage following ischemic stroke are essential. A previous
study investigated a series of intervention methods and
reported that physical exercise may be effective in alleviating
brain injury following ischemic stroke (18); however, the
mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of exercise
prior to ischemic brain injury required elucidation in order to
encourage individuals with high risk factors of stroke to begin
to exercise regularly.
In the pathological process of cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion injury, neurotoxicity due to glutamate over‑release
is a primary damaging factor (6). EAATs were reported to
have a key role in the uptake process of excess extracellular glutamate (9,10), and they were found to downregulate
glutamate uptake ability, resulting in an ~65% increase of
glutamate concentration following diffuse brain injury (19).
EAAT‑2 is expressed in astrocytes of different brain areas,
particularly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (20)
and was reported to be responsible for 90% of glutamate
re‑uptake into the prosencephalon of rats (21). EAAT‑2
knockout mice showed selective neuronal deterioration in the
area of hippocampal CA1, indicating the role of EAAT‑2 in
neuroprotection (22). The results of the present study demonstrated that pre‑ischemic exercise enhanced expression levels
of EAAT‑2, therefore alleviating the neurotoxicity caused by
excessive release of glutamate.
ERK1/2 was reported to have different roles in the
pre‑ and post‑stroke phases (11‑14). Previous studies have
indicated that an inhibitor of mitogen‑activated protein kinase
(MAPK)/ERK (MEK1) alleviated brain damage of mice
following ischemic stroke, indicating that the MEK1‑ERK1/2
