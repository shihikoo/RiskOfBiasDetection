Abstract Recombinant T cell Receptor Ligand 1000
(RTL1000), a partial human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule coupled to a human myelin peptide,
reduces infarct size after experimental stroke in HLADRB1*1502 transgenic (DR2-Tg) mice. In this study, we
characterized the therapeutic time window of opportunity for
RTL1000; we explored the efficacy of a single dose of
RTL1000 administration and determined if RTL1000 affords
long-term neurobehavioral functional improvement after ischemic stroke. Male DR2-Tg mice underwent 60 min of
intraluminal reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). RTL1000 or vehicle was injected 4, 6, or 8 h after
MCAO, followed by three daily injections. In the single-dose
study, one-time injection of RTL1000 was applied 4 h after
MCAO. Cortical, striatal, and hemispheric infarct sizes were
measured 24 or 96 h after stroke. Behavioral testing, including

neuroscore evaluation, open field, paw preference, and novel
object recognition, was performed up to 28 days after stroke.
Our data showed that RTL1000 significantly reduced the
infarct size 96 h after MCAO when the first injection was
given at 4 and 6 h, but not 8 h, after the onset of stroke. A
single dose of 400 or 100 μg RTL1000 also significantly
reduced the infarct size 24 h after MCAO. Behavioral testing
showed that RTL1000 treatment used 4 h after MCAO improved long-term cognitive outcome 28 days after stroke.
Taken together, RTL1000 protects against acute injury if
applied within a 6-h time window and improves long-term
functional recovery after experimental stroke in DR2-Tg
mice.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke induces activation of the peripheral immune
system and recruitment of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes [1–4]. These immune cells infiltrate the brain and exacerbate the developing
infarction. T cell- and B cell-deficient animals have reduced
infarct size, and modulation of the inflammatory response
improves outcomes in experimental ischemic stroke [5, 6].
However, the inflammatory response to cerebral ischemia is
biphasic, characterized by an initial activation phase during
the first 6–22 h [7] and followed by an immunosuppressive
phase characterized by pronounced atrophy of the spleen and
thymus 96 h after stroke [8, 9]. Therefore, non-specific immune-suppressive therapy could worsen the outcome by increasing the risk of fatal infection [10].

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:60–68

Recombinant T-cell receptor ligands (RTLs) are a class of
partial major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules comprising covalently linked α1 and β1 chains that are
tethered to antigenic peptides which selectively modulate
autoaggressive CD4+ T cells by delivering partial agonist
signals through the T cell receptor (TCR) [11–13]. CD4+ cells
are believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of stroke
through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
IL-2, IL-12, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. Modulation of RTL on CD4+
T cells inhibits the accumulation of inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages/activated microglial cells, reducing the
infarct size and improving neurological deficit after experimental stroke [14].
Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), which leaks
out of the brain with the breakdown of blood–brain barrier and
is detected by the peripheral immune system after stroke, leads
to MOG-specific T cells migrating into the brain, mistaking
brain antigens for foreign pathogens and attacking them.
Therefore, RTL with a myelin antigenic peptide can selectively modulate brain-targeted immune response via TCR, while
leaving other portions of the immune system intact [14, 15].
We have previously demonstrated that RTL551, a mouse
MHC coupled to mouse myelin peptide, is effective in reducing the infarct size in experimental stroke in C57BL/6 mice
[15]. Further investigations confirmed that the mechanism of
protection was indeed related to the modulation of inflammatory activity of brain myelin antigen-reactive T lymphocytes.
To determine if a similar strategy would work against human
T cells, we determined the efficacy of humanized recombinant
T cell receptor ligand 1000 (RTL1000), which contains a
human MHC covalently linked to a human myelin peptide
in experimental stroke in humanized DR2-Tg mice which
expresses human TCR [14]. Furthermore, RTL1000 has been
evaluated in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled
phase I dose-escalating clinical trial for treatment of multiple
sclerosis (MS) [16]. To move this potential stroke therapy
closer to the clinic, and in meeting the preclinical criteria set
by the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable
(STAIR) [17, 18], in the current study, we evaluated the
therapeutic window of efficacy of RTL1000 in DR2-Tg mice,
tested the efficacy of a single dose of RTL1000, and examined
its potential long-term neurobehavioral functional benefit.

Animals and Experimental Groups
Experiments were carried out on 164 male HLA-DRB1*1502
transgenic (DR2-Tg) mice (produced at the Portland VA Medical Center with foundation breeders provided by Dr. Chella
David [19]) aged 8 to 12 weeks and weighing 20 to 27 g; 12 to
15 mice per group were used for the time window studies, 20
mice per group for long-term behavioral assessment, and 5
mice per group for the sham reversible middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) groups. In single-dose studies, 6 mice per
group were used in 100 μg RTL1000 groups and 12 mice per
group in 400 μg RTL1000 groups. Mice were randomly
assigned to either RTL1000 or vehicle groups, and the surgeon and the examiner who performed and scored the behavior tests were blinded to treatment groups.
RTL1000 Production and Purification
RTL molecules consist of the α1 and β1 domains of MHC II
molecule expressed as a single polypeptide with or without
antigenic amino terminal extensions [11, 20]. RTL1000 is a
HLA-DRB1*1502 (DR2) molecule linked to human MOG35–55
peptide (MEVGWYRPPFSRVVHLYRNGK) [14].
RTL1000 was constructed de novo or by sequential sitedirected mutagenesis of previous constructs. Protein purification was performed with a 30- to 40-mg yield of purified
protein per liter of bacterial cell culture.
RTL1000 Treatment
Mice were randomized to injections of 100 μL of either
RTL1000 (1 μg/μL) or vehicle (5 % dextrose in Tris–HCl, pH
8.5) by subcutaneous (S.C.) injection. In the time window study,
animals were divided into three groups according to the time of
first injection (4, 6, or 8 h after MCAO), which was followed by
three injections of the same volume and concentration at 24, 48,
and 72 h after MCAO. In single-dose studies, animals were
treated with a one-time injection of 400 or 100 μg RTL1000
4 h after MCAO. In behavioral testing animals, the first injection
was given at 4 h after stroke, followed by three daily injections at
24, 48, and 72 h after MCAO. The reason that 4 h after MCAO
was selected as the first injection time in the behavioral study is
because the greatest effect on the infarct size was seen during that
time window.

Materials and Methods
Reversible Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Ethics Statement
Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals, and protocols were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee at Oregon Health & Science University and the Portland Veteran Affairs Medical Center.

Reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was
induced via the intraluminal filament technique as described
previously with slight modifications [21]. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (5 % induction, 1 % maintenance) by
using a mask connected with a vaporizer (Isotec 4; Cyprane,
England) throughout surgery and during 60 min of vascular

62

occlusion until filament withdrawal and initiation of reperfusion. Rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at
36.5±0.5 °C throughout surgery with a warm water pad and
a heating lamp. Cortical blood flow (CBF) was monitored by
Laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF; Model DRT4, Moor Instruments Ltd.; Oxford, England). The right lateral common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed and temporarily ligated. The
right external carotid artery (ECA) was ligated and cauterized.
Ipsilateral MCAO was accomplished by inserting a 6–0 nylon
monofilament surgical suture (ETHICON, Inc.; Somerville,
NJ, USA) with a heat-rounded and silicone-coated (Xantopren
Comfort Light, Heraeus; Germany) tip into the internal carotid
artery (ICA) via the ECA stump till the tip of filament reaches
the beginning of middle cerebral artery (MCA). The successful occlusion of MCA was confirmed by an abrupt drop and
then sustained reduction in the CBF. The filament was withdrawn, and the CCA was released to allow for reperfusion at
60 min of occlusion. The mice were then allowed to recover
from anesthesia and survived for 96 h following the onset of
ischemia. In sham groups, the right CCA was exposed and
temporarily ligated and then the right ECA was ligated and
cauterized. No filament was placed or advanced (no MCAO),
with the mice being anesthetized throughout the surgery until
CCA ligation was released 60 min later. Animals were excluded if CBF did not drop below 30 % of baseline during
MCAO or due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
Determination of Infarct Volume
Animals were euthanized, and brains were harvested 96 h
after MCAO. Infarct volumes were measured after staining
brain slices with 1.2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC, Sigma; St. Louis, MO, USA). Four slices of 2-mmthick coronal sections were incubated in 1.2 % TTC for
15 min at 37 °C and then fixed in 10 % formalin overnight.
Both sides of each stained slice were photographed and evaluated by SigmaScan Pro 5.0 (Jandel, San G, Rafael, CA,
USA). Infarct volume was expressed as a percentage of contralateral structure (cortex, striatum, and hemisphere). To account for the effect of edema, infarct volume was calculated
by subtracting the ipsilateral non-infarct region from the total
contralateral structure volume and dividing the difference by
the contralateral volume [22].

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:60–68

assessments were carried out during the first half of the light
cycle (08:00–12:00 hours). All instruments were sterilized
with a 10 % ethanol solution between trials.
Locomotor Activity in the Open Field Spontaneous locomotor
activity was measured by conducting the open-field protocol
[25]. Mice were placed individually into a 41 cm (W)×41 cm
(D)×38 cm (H) plastic enclosure equipped with a video
camera mounted above to record movement in four arenas
simultaneously. The video was analyzed post-capture off-line
using Noldus software (Ethovision 3.1, Noldus; Leesburg,
VA, USA). Total distance traveled, mean velocity, and total
movement during a 30-min open-field test were assessed at
baseline, 1 day prior to and 6 days after MCAO.
Neurodeficit Score A neurodeficit score was conducted for
each mouse on days 1 and 3 after surgery [26]. The score was
calculated by using a graded scoring system with 0 indicating
no deficit and the upper limit indicating the most impaired.
The categories scored included consciousness (0–3), interaction (0–2), eye appearance (0–2), breathing (0–2), food and
water intake (0–2), ability to grip wire bar (0–2), gait disturbance (0–5), and activity (0–2).
Novel Object Recognition Mice were placed individually into a
41 cm (W)×41 cm (D)×38 cm (H) plastic enclosure and allowed
to habituate to the arena before novel object recognition testing
[27]. During the sample session at 27 days after MCAO (examining long-term cognitive impairment), two identical objects
were placed in opposite corners of the arena, approximately
2.5 cm from the wall. The time spent exploring each object
during the sample session was hand scored with stop watches,
and each mouse was removed from the arena after 5 min. After a
24-h delay, mice were again placed in the arena for a test session
on day 28 after MCAO, with one object replaced with a novel
object. The location of the novel object was determined by
replacing the object explored less during the sample session in
efforts to reduce spatial bias. A 7-min test session was performed,
and the time exploring each object was recorded and hand scored
with stopwatches. The final score was calculated as the percentage of time spent exploring the new object divided by the total
exploration time during the test session. All objects used in this
study were characterized previously in our laboratory to ensure
that mice prefer each object equally.

Neurobehavioral Evaluations
We selected behavioral tests which have consistently provided
reliable evaluations of outcome across experimental rodent
ischemia studies [21, 23, 24]. Mice in the following groups
were randomized for behavioral testing: RTL1000- and
vehicle-treated MCAO (n=16 each group), and RTL1000and vehicle-treated sham mice (n=5 per group). All mice were
singly housed in a 12/12-h light/dark cycle, and all

Cylinder Test The cylinder test was performed to analyze
forelimb use bias [23, 24]. Each mouse was placed in a
transparent cylinder measuring 9 cm in diameter and 15 cm
in height. The cylinder’s dimensions were designed to be wide
enough for the mouse to move freely and yet small enough to
encourage rearing behavior. Four separate video cameras were
placed around the cylinder at 90° intervals in order to record
rearing behavior from all angles. A maximum of one paw

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:60–68

touch for each rearing event was recorded. A maximum of 20
and a minimum of 10 forelimb touches were recorded during
the 15-min test. If the minimum number of touches was not
reached during the first trial, additional trials were completed.
The final score was calculated as the percentage of total
touches that used the impaired forelimb. Baseline paw preference was assessed 1 day before MCAO with subsequent
assessments made at 7 and 28 days after MCAO. The final
score was calculated as the percentage of left paw touches
(right-sided stroke) divided by the total number of touches.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean±SEM. Differences in the infarct
size were determined by two-way ANOVA and followed by the
Holm-Sidak post hoc test, with the two factors being brain
region and treatment group. Similarly, differences in neurobehavioral performance and body weight were also analyzed by
two-way ANOVA and the Holm-Sidak test, with the two factors
being experimental group and time (days treated). Differences
in novel object recognition scores among the four groups were
analyzed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Newman-Keuls
test. Finally, the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks was conducted to evaluate differences among the four experimental groups
(sham + vehicle, sham + RTL1000, MCAO + vehicle, and
MCAO+RTL1000) in median neurodeficit score, with a post
hoc Dunn’s test being used for all pairwise comparisons against
the control (sham + vehicle) group following rank-based
ANOVA as treatment group sizes were unequal. The multiple
comparisons on ranks did not include an adjustment for ties.
Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat3 statistical
software (Systat Software, Inc.; Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical
significance was set at p<0.05.

Results
Exclusions and Mortality
Surgery successful rate was 98.7 %, with two mice being
excluded due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and the
other one excluded because CBF did not drop by 70 % of
baseline during MCAO. In the behavioral study, three mice
were excluded due to severe neck tilt after MCAO surgery
(which interfered with performance in behavioral tests). Overall mortality was 12.8 % (12.3 vs. 13.2 % in RTL1000- vs.
vehicle-treated groups).
RTL1000 Reduced Infarct Size when Administered Not Later
than 6 h After the Onset of Experimental Ischemic Stroke
We first tested the effect of RTL1000 when it was administered at
4, 24, 48, and 72 h after MCAO. As shown in Fig. 1a, b, male

63

DR2-Tg mice treated with RTL1000 had smaller infarcts compared to vehicle-treated mice. Quantitative analysis of TTCstained brain slices 96 h after ischemia showed that the infarct
size was 28.0±3.7 %, 34.7±6.1 %, and 19.1±2.4 % in the
cortex, striatum, and total hemisphere, respectively, in
RTL1000-treated mice, compared to 46.4±1.7 %, 60.1±5.9 %,
and 31.8±2.1 % in vehicle-treated mice (p<0.05).
When the first administration was delayed until 6 h after
MCAO, RTL1000 significantly reduced the infarct size only in
the cortex, but not in the striatum (Fig. 1c). Cortical infarct size
was 33.9±3.3 %, and hemispheric infarct was 22.6±2.3 % in
RTL1000-treated mice compared to 44.1±2.3 % and 31.9±
1.3 % in vehicle-treated animals (p<0.05). The infarct size in
the striatum was 58.0±3.5 % and 64.6±1.7 %, respectively, in
RTL1000 and vehicle treatment groups (p=0.12).
RTL1000 had no effect on the infarct size when the first
treatment was delayed until 8 h after MCAO (Fig. 1d). The
infarct size was 46.7±1.6 %, 64.1±3.0 %, and 33.0±1.7 % in
the cortex, striatum, and hemisphere in RTL1000-treated mice
and 45.1±1.3 % (p=0.16), 70.4±2.7 % (p=0.08), and 33.9±
1.7 % (p=0.72) in vehicle-treated mice, respectively.
There were no significant differences in LDF before, during MCAO or after reperfusion and no difference in age or
baseline body weight between RTL1000- and vehicle-treated
animals (data not shown).

Single Dose of RTL1000 Administration Reduced Infarct Size
24 h After MCAO
We explored if a single dose of RTL1000 treatment can
reduce the infarct size. Our data showed that a single
dose of 400 μg of RTL1000 given 4 h after MCAO
significantly reduced the infarct size 24 h after stroke
(Fig. 2). Infarct volumes were 20.2±1.8 %, 45.9±3.0 %,
and 13.3±1.3 % in the cortex, striatum, and hemisphere,
respectively, in RTL1000-treated mice compared to 38.9
±2.4 %, 61.7±3.1 %, and 25.5±2.1 % in vehicle-treated
mice (p<0.05). We further found that one-time 100-μg
RTL100 injection also reduced the infarct size in the
cortex and striatum 24 h after MCAO with the infarct
size being 22.2±4.0 % and 47.2±4.2 %, respectively, in
RTL1000-treated mice, compared to 40.8± 3.3 % and
64.3±6.0 % (p<0.05). There was, however, no statistically significant difference in the total hemispheric infarct between RTL1000- and vehicle-treated mice in the
100-μg group (28.6±3.1 % vs. 17.0±2.2 %). This is
likely due to the small number of animals, and not
related to efficacy differences between the two doses,
since cortical and striatal infarcts were statistically significant in both groups. Furthermore, means of infarct
size measurements were similar in animals treated with
either 100 or 400 μg RTL1000, although the difference

were used in control groups. Brains were harvested 24 h after MCAO,
and infarct volumes were measured by TTC and expressed as a percentage of the contralateral region. *p<0.05 compared with corresponding

The open-field test was performed on the day before MCAO or
sham surgery and on day 6 after surgery when motor function
has recovered, in order to avoid the potential confounding effect
of motor activity differences on cognitive testing. No significant
differences in total distance traveled, velocity, or total movement
were observed during a 30-min open-field test, regardless of
surgery or treatment (data not shown); therefore, no mice were
excluded due to inability of performing this task.
Body weights were measured 1 day before MCAO
(pretest) and on days 1, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 27, and 28 after
MCAO. Both vehicle- and RTL1000-treated animals
displayed a significant weight loss beginning on day 1 after
MCAO, and all animals returned to their baseline body weight
by 28 days after surgery. Compared to vehicle-treated animals,
RTL1000-treated mice lost less weight on days 3 and 6
(p<0.05). Furthermore, we found that RTL1000-treated mice
recovered from body weight loss as early as 14 days after
stroke, while vehicle-treated mice did not return to their baseline body weight until day 21 after MCAO. Both sham

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:60–68

MCAO animals in RTL1000- and vehicle-treated group did
not lose their body weight compared to baseline (Fig. 3).
Distribution of neurodeficit scores within the sham and
MCAO groups regardless of treatment at each time point
would suggest that MCAO had an impact on increasing, and
thus worsening, neurodeficit score over time compared to
sham (Table 1). Distribution of neurodeficit scores within
the sham+vehicle and sham+RTL1000 groups was the same
at each time point evaluated (Table 1). Distribution of
neurodeficit scores within the MCAO + vehicle and
MCAO+RTL1000 groups at each time point would suggest
that RTL had an impact on decreasing, and thus improving,
neurodeficit score over time compared to vehicle (Table 1).
Differences in the median neurodeficit scores among the four
experimental groups (sham + vehicle, sham + RTL1000,
MCAO+vehicle, MCAO+RTL1000) were greater than that
would be expected by chance at 1 day (p<0.05) and 3 days
(p<0.05) following MCAO (Table 1). A significant difference
(p<0.05) was observed between the sham and MCAO groups
regardless of treatment at 1 and 3 days following MCAO
(Table 1). However, no differences were seen between
sham+vehicle and sham+RTL1000 groups and between
MCAO+vehicle and MCAO+RTL1000 groups at 1 and
3 days following MCAO.
The novel object recognition test was performed on day 28
after surgery (Fig. 4). Vehicle-treated MCAO mice showed a
deficit in novel object preference (51.3±5 %) compared to all
other groups, indicating impaired memory retention 4 weeks
after MCAO (p<0.01). The RTL1000-treated MCAO mice
explored the novel object 65.6±4.2 %, which was similar to
RTL1000-treated sham (68.5±3 %) and vehicle-treated sham
mice (67.3±3.0 %).
Motor dysfunction was assessed via the cylinder test on the
day before surgery and again on days 7 and 28 after surgery by

S.C. at 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after MCAO. Body weights were measured
1 day before MCAO (pretest) and on days 1, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 27, and 28.

measuring the use of the left paw, the contralateral side of the
MCAO. No differences were found between RTL1000- and
vehicle-treated MCAO mice on day 7 and day 28 (Fig. 5).
There were trends of impaired left paw use on day 7 and
recovered left paw motor function on day 28, both in
RTL1000- and vehicle-treated mice. However, these trends
did not reach statistical significance.

Discussion
We have previously demonstrated that RTL1000 reduced the
infarct size 96 h after MCAO [14]. In this study, we further
characterized the therapeutic time window, the effect of single
dose, and the long-term functional benefit of RTL1000 in
humanized DR2-Tg male mice.
A clinically applicable therapeutic time window is a
significant factor that will have a major impact on the
success of pilot clinical trials [17]. Our previous data
showed that RTL1000 significantly reduced the infarct
size when administrated 1 or 3 h after the onset of
ischemia and followed by three daily injections [14,
28]. However, the timing of treatment is not practical
for clinical trials because very few patients can get
treatment within 3 h after stroke onset. We therefore
tested the effect of the first RTL1000 administration
given at 4 h following ischemia. Our data showed that
RTL1000 significantly reduced the infarct size at 96 h
after MCAO. We then tried to extend the therapeutic
time window to 6 and 8 h after occlusion. However,
there was no therapeutic benefit when RTL1000 was
first given 8 h after ischemia, but there was some
benefit, at least in the cortex, when RTL1000 was
administered 6 h after MCAO. We conclude according
to these results that RTL1000 treatment protects against
ischemic stroke when RTL1000 first administration is
given within 6 h following ischemia and the protection
is more robust when it is applied at 4 h after MCAO.
Clinically, single-dose therapy is much more convenient
than multiple administrations. We therefore tested if RTL1000
is still effective when a one-time injection applied 4 h after
MCAO. We demonstrated that both 400 and 100 μg of
RTL1000 reduce the infarct size 24 h after stroke. However,
further characterization, including long-term functional assessment, is still needed for the single-dose administration.
Difficulty in translating animal experimental results
into clinical trials has led to guidelines recommending
evaluation of clinically relevant long-term neurobehavioral functional outcomes for the preclinical validation
of acute ischemic stroke therapies [17, 18]. We performed several behavioral tasks to assess functional
outcome up to 28 days following ischemia. Our data

indicate that RTL1000 treatment improves body weight
recovery, which is related to the animals’ overall health
state. However, there was no difference in the median
neurodeficit score between RTL1000- and vehicletreated mice on either day 1 or 3. Thus, health status
did not affect the results of motor activity and cognitive
testing. The novel object recognition memory test
showed that RTL1000-treated mice performed cognitively better than vehicle-treated mice 4 weeks after stroke.
However, in the cylinder test, no asymmetries were
observed between vehicle- and RTL1000-treated mice.
Taken together, these findings indicate that RTL1000

improves long-term neurocognitive function, but has no
effect on sensorimotor deficit recovery.
Mechanistically, RTL1000 binds to and modulates the
expression of the MHC class II invariant chain, CD74,
the cellular receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory
factor, which reduces the transmigration of inflammatory
cells from the periphery into the central nervous system
(CNS) infarcted region [15, 29]. Furthermore, blockade
of migration inhibitory factor activity reduces the release of inflammatory cytokines by T cells, including
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-specific
cells that have been im plicated previously as

Fig. 4 RTL1000 improves cognitive function after MCAO in DR2-Tg
mice. Male DR2-Tg mice were subjected to 60-min transient MCAO or
sham surgery and were treated with 100-μg RTL1000 or 100-μL vehicle
given S.C. at 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after MCAO. In the novel object
recognition memory test, time spent exploring each object was scored
on day 28 post-MCAO. The final score was calculated as the percentage
of time spent exploring the new object divided by the total exploration
time during the test session. The dotted line indicates the percentage of
time spent exploring the novel object when an animal fails to recognize
the object as novel (50 % of total time; i.e., equal time spent on novel and
familiar objects). *p<0.05

DR2-Tg mice. Male DR2-Tg mice were subjected to 60-min transient
MCAO and treated with 100-μg RTL1000 or 100-μL vehicle given S.C.
at 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after MCAO. The paw preference test (cylinder test)
was performed to analyze forelimb use bias. A maximum of one paw
touch for each rearing event was recorded. Baseline paw preference was
assessed 1 day before MCAO with subsequent assessments at 7 and
28 days after MCAO. The final score was calculated as the percentage
of left paw touches (right-sided stroke) divided by the total number of
touches

contributors to stroke severity [30], and inhibits activation of microglial cells in the CNS [31]. These effects
coupled with neuroprotective activity of RTLs observed
in other CNS disease models provide a strong rationale
supporting the use of RTL1000 in treatment of MCAO
[32].

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated that RTL1000 protects against
acute ischemic brain injury. The therapeutic time window is
within 6 h after the onset of stroke, and the best effect is seen at
4 h after stroke. Single-dose treatment may be used clinically.
RTL1000 improves long-term neurocognitive functional recovery, but there is no effect in sensorimotor function
recovery.
