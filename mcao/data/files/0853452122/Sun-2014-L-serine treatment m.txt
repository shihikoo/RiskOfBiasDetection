Abstract
The present study was conducted to clarify whether treatment with L-serine can improve the brain repair and
neurorestoration of rats after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). After pMCAO, the neurological
functions, brain lesion volume, and cortical injury were determined. GDNF, NGF, NCAM L1, tenascin-C, and Nogo-A levels
were measured. Proliferation and differentiation of the neural stem cells (NSCs) and proliferation of the microvessels in the
ischemic boundary zone of the cortex were evaluated. Treatment with L-serine (168 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) began 3 h
after pMCAO and was repeated every 12 h for 7 days or until the end of the experiment. L-Serine treatment: 1) reduced the
lesion volume and neuronal loss; 2) improved the recovery of neurological functions; 3) elevated the expression of nerve
growth-related factors; and 4) facilitated the proliferation of endogenous NSCs and microvessels activated after pMCAO and
increased the number of new-born neurons. 5) D-cycloserine, an inhibitor of serine hydroxymethyltransferase, blunted the
effects of L-serine on NSC proliferation, differentiation, microvascular proliferation. In conclusions, L-serine treatment in
pMCAO rats can reduce brain injury and facilitate neurorestoration which is partly associated with the improvement of
proliferation of NSCs and microvessels, reconstruction of neurovascular units and resultant neurorepair. The effects of Lserine on endogenous NSC proliferation and microvascular proliferation are partly mediated by the action of L-serine as a
substrate for the production of one-carbon groups used for purine and pyrimidine synthesis and modulation of the
expression of some nerve growth-related factors.

regeneration of the brain after damage is still active days and even
weeks after a stroke occurs, which might provide a second window
for treatment [10]. Neuroregeneration is currently a hot subject,
but there are many factors that influence the regeneration of brain
tissue, and the involved mechanisms are very complicated; thus
far, there has been no substantial breakthrough [6,7]. Transplantation of cells or tissues tested to promote neural regeneration and
brain tissue repair after injury includes peripheral nerve grafts,
Schwann cells, embryonic brain and spinal cord tissue, olfactory
ensheathing cells, embryonic stem cells, neural stem cells (NSCs),
bone marrow stromal cells, activated macrophages, and others
[7,11–13], but the involved methodology is still in its infancy, and
the efficacy of transplantation is unreliable [9,14,15]. An
alternative method is to promote endogenous NSC proliferation
[16,17] and to help these cells migrate to the injured area, repair
damaged brain tissue and restore neurological function; however,
there is still a great distance to clinical application for this method
[9,16]. To achieve neurorestoration in the treatment of brain
injury, at least obtaining recovery of motor and cognitive function,

Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability
worldwide. The pathophysiology of stroke is complicated and
involves excitotoxic mechanisms, oxidative and nitrative stresses,
inflammatory responses, ionic imbalances, apoptosis, angiogenesis,
neuroprotection, and neurorestoration [1–4]. Previously developed treatment strategies for ischemic stroke primarily focused on
reducing the size of ischemic damage and rescuing dying cells
early after occurrence [4,5]. A large number of neuroprotective
agents have been designed to interrupt the ischemic cascade, but
clinical therapeutic trials of these agents have not demonstrated
consistent benefits, despite successful preceding animal studies
[4,5]. Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is the
only therapy for acute ischemic stroke approved by the United
States Food and Drug Administration, but its use is limited by a
narrow therapeutic window [1,4,5].
Alternatively, many investigators have attempted to promote
neural regeneration and brain repair after injury [6–9] because

several things are needed including reduced brain cell loss,
recruitment of existing but latent connections, and development of
new neurons and neural connections [5,18,19].
L-Serine is a crucial neurotrophic factor and a precursor for
phosphatidyl-L-serine, L-cysteine, nucleotides, sphingolipids, and
neurotransmitters such as D-serine and glycine. It plays an
important role in neuronal development and function in the
central nervous system (CNS) [20]. Our previous studies have
demonstrated that L-serine treatment at an early stage after
cerebral ischemia in rats can exert a neuroprotective effect that is
potentially mediated by reducing neuronal excitability through
activating glycine receptors [21] and improving the cerebral blood
flow through activating apamin and charybdotoxin-sensitive Ca2+activated K+ channels on the endothelium [22]. Moreover, Lserine, as the predominant source of one-carbon groups for the de
novo synthesis of purine nucleotides and deoxythymidine monophosphate, as reviewed by de Koning et al., plays a central role in
cellular proliferation [23]. We hypothesised that treatment with Lserine after brain injury might thus facilitate neuroregeneration.
Therefore, the present study was performed to clarify whether
treatment with L-serine could improve the brain repair and
neurorestoration of the rats after permanent focal cerebral
ischemia.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery

Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 220–250 g were used in
the present study (obtained from the Experimental Animal Centre
of Nantong University, Nantong, China). About 10–12 rats were
randomly allocated to each experimental group. Due to anesthetic
accident and anesthetic side effects such as adynamic ileus, some
rats died during the experiments and a part of samples were lost in
each group. L-serine treatment did not significantly influence the
mortality rate of rats. Behavioural measurements including
neurological severity scores and learning and memory and cell
counting after Nissl staining and immunochemistry were performed by investigators blinded to the treatment groups. All
procedures were in strict accordance with the institutional
guidelines of Nantong University, which complies with international rules and policies. Ethics in accordance with the ARRIVE
(Animal Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines were
followed in the animal experiments and approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Nantong University, Nantong, China
(Permit Number: 20120210-02). All surgery was performed under
anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.

Rats were fasted overnight with free access to water. All animals
were anesthetised first with 2 mL of enflurane, and anesthetisation
was maintained with 10% chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg body
weight, i.p.). Permanent MCAO (pMCAO) was induced as
reported previously [22,24]. Briefly, after a midline neck incision,
the right common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery
(ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed, and the
proximal ECA and CCA were then ligated. The vagus nerve was
carefully preserved as far as possible. A specialised nylon suture
with a 0.18 mm diameter (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co. Ltd.,
Beijing, China) was used. The tip of this suture was coated with
silicon gel and the diameter of it was 0.24 mm. The suture was
introduced from the lumen of the distal CCA just before
bifurcation into the ICA until resistance was felt. Thus, the origin
of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded by the nylon
suture. The average depth of filament insertion was 18.560.5 mm
away from the bifurcation. Then, the exposed vessels were
carefully ligated to prevent bleeding, and the incision was closed
aseptically. Sham-operated animals were subjected to the same
surgical procedure, but the suture was not advanced beyond the
internal carotid bifurcation. A laser Doppler perfusion monitor
(PeriFlux System 5010, Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden) was used to
monitor cerebral blood flow (CBF) throughout the operation. The
ischemic model was considered successful if an approximately 75%
reduction in CBF was induced immediately after placement of the
suture [22,25]. Otherwise, the animals were excluded. The rectal
temperature of the rats was maintained at 3760.5uC using a
temperature-regulated heating pad throughout the anaesthetic
period including surgical preparation. After revival from anaesthesia, the animals were placed back into cages with the room
temperature maintained at 2562uC. Some of the rats died during
the experiment, and the mortality during the first 24 h after
pMCAO operation was 20.6% and 19.7%, and the additional
mortality until end-point was 7.5% and 7.2%, respectively, in the
vehicle and L-serine treated groups. In addition, about 30% of the
rats we used in this study developed adynamic ileus with a swollen
abdomen, lethargy, anorexia and resultant death several days after
MCAO. Data from these animals were excluded.

Neurological functions were evaluated at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21,
28, and 35 days after pMCAO and scored on a scale of 0 to 18
points (normal score, 0 point; maximal deficit score, 18 points)
through motor, sensory, balance, and reflex tests [26,27]. For the
injury severity scores, 1 point was awarded for the inability to
perform the test or for the lack of a tested reflex; thus, the higher
score is, the more severe is the injury.
Motor tests (6 points) were as scored as follows: 1) raising rat by
the tail (3 points)-1, flexion of forelimb; 1, flexion of hind limb; and
1, head moved .10u to vertical axis within 30 s and 2) placing rat
on the floor (normal = 0 point, maximum = 3 points); 0 normal
walk; 1, inability to walk straight; 2, circling toward the paretic
side; and 3, fall down to the paretic side.
Sensory tests (2 points) were scored as follows: 1) placing test
(visual and tactile test) and 2) proprioceptive test (deep sensation,
pushing the paw against the table edge to stimulate limb muscles).

is the volume of control hemisphere (left side) and VL the volume
of non-injured tissue in the injured hemisphere (right side).

Beam balance tests (normal = 0 point, maximum = 6 points)
were as scored as follows: 0, balances with steady posture; 1, grasps
side of beam; 2, hugs the beam and one limb falls down from the
beam; 3, hugs the beam and two limbs fall down from the beam,
or spins on beam (.60 s); 4, attempts to balance on the beam but
falls off (.40 s); 5, attempts to balance on the beam but falls off
(.20 s); and 6, falls off, no attempt to balance or hang on to the
beam (,20 s).
Reflexes absent and abnormal movements (4 points) tests were
scored as follows: 1, pinna reflex (head shake when touching the
auditory meatus); 1, corneal reflex (eye blink when lightly touching
the cornea with cotton); 1, startle reflex (motor response to a brief
noise from snapping a clipboard paper; and 1, seizures,
myoclonus, and myodystony.

Nissl staining
Thirty-five days after pMCAO, rats were anaesthetised with
10% chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused with 250 mL
of normal saline and subsequently with 200 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). The rat brains were then
removed and post-fixed for 24 h in the same fixative. The postfixed brain tissues were cryo-protected in 20% then 30% sucrose
in PBS. The brain tissues were then sectioned coronally with
20 mm thickness with a cryostat slicer (CM1900, Leica, Bensheim,
Germany). The sections from bregma -2.92 mm to -3.72 mm were
prepared, mounted with neutral balata (Shanghai Specimen and
Model Factory, Shanghai, China) and blotted onto slides, and then
covered with a coverslip after Nissl staining, which was performed
as reported previously [21].
After Nissl staining, neuronal cells in the cortex along the lesion
area were identified under a high-magnification (6400) light
microscope and counted by an investigator blinded to the
grouping. For each rat, the mean number of neurons was
obtained by examining three serial coronal sections. In each
section, the number of neurons was averaged from three different
vision fields of the cortex. Only intact neurons with a clearly
defined cell body and nucleus were counted.

Testing of behaviour in a Morris water maze
On day 6 to day 2 before the operation of pMCAO, rats were
placed for 30 seconds at first on a platform (12 cm in diameter)
that was hidden 2 cm below the water surface in a pool 1.6 m in
diameter filled with 25uC water and then were placed in one of the
three quadrants without the platform, and the time to find the
platform (up to 90 seconds) was recorded. This training was
repeated four times a day, and the rats were trained for
consecutive 5 days. On day 1 before pMCAO, the platform was
moved away from the Morris water maze (RD1101-MWM-HG,
Mobiledatum Co. Ltd, Shanghai, China), the rats were placed in
one of the four quadrants, and the swimming trace and the time to
enter the place of platform were recorded. After pMCAO, the
training was repeated on days 8–12 and on days 29–33, and the
recording of swimming trace and the time to enter the place of
platform was repeated again on days 13 and 34.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The concentrations of GDNF, NGF, NCAM L1, TN-C, and
Nogo-A in the brain tissue of both sides were measured with
ELISA in three groups of rats: the sham-operated, vehicle, and Lserine-treated groups (each n = 6). Five days after pMCAO, each
rat brain was harvested under anaesthesia of 10% chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg, i.p.), frozen and stored at 280uC until use. Brain
homogenates were centrifuged at 4uC and 14,000 rpm for 30 min.
Supernatants were transferred to new Eppendorf tubes, and the
protein concentration of the supernatants was measured with a
bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. Then, the supernatants were
assayed in duplicate using GDNF, NGF, NCAM L1, TN-C, and
Nogo-A assay kits according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Measurement of CBF and other physiological parameters
According to the literature [22,25], CBF was continuously
monitored before and during the operation of pMCAO with a
laser Doppler perfusion monitor (PeriFlux System 5000, Perimed).
Briefly, a sagittal skin incision approximately 1.5 cm long was
made. A scanning probe (407-1, Perimed) was carefully placed on
the skull ipsilateral to the pMCAO under a stereotaxic device
(51653, Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA) with its centre at
5 mm lateral to midline and 1 mm posterior to bregma, thus
avoiding any large vessel. During the measurement of CBF,
transcutaneous partial pressure of O2 (tcPO2) was simultaneously
monitored from the hip skin of the rat using a probe (E5250,
Perimed) [28]. Blood pressure and heart rate were simultaneously
measured with a caudal artery pressure measuring system (Alcott
Biotech Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China).

Immunohistochemistry
To examine the effects of L-serine on the proliferation and
differentiation of NSCs and the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells, the rats were sacrificed under anaesthesia of 10% chloral
hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.) by transcardial perfusion with PBS on
day 6 for detecting BrdU/nestin-positive NSCs and vWF-positive
endothelial cells and on day 14 for detecting BrdU/NeuN-positive
neurons after pMCAO, and the brains were removed and postfixed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde. The post-fixed brains
were cryo-protected in PBS containing 25% sucrose. The brains
were then sectioned to 5-mm thickness with a cryostat slicer
(CM1900, Leica, Bensheim, Germany). BrdU was dissolved in
PBS (6.25 mg/mL) and injected into rats (50 mg/kg body weight,
i.p.) twice daily from day 3 to day 5 after pMCAO.
For immunofluorescent staining, the brain sections were washed
three times with 0.01 mol/L PBS containing 0.3% Triton X (wash
buffer, pH 7.4) for 30 min, incubated with 2 N HCl for 20 min at
37uC, washed three times again with wash buffer for 30 min, and
blocked with 3% normal donkey or goat serum (Jackson, West
Grove, USA) in wash buffer for 60 min at room temperature. The
sections were then incubated in blocking solution with primary
antibody, mouse anti-BrdU antibody (1:500), rabbit anti-nestin
antibody (1:150), rabbit anti-NeuN antibody (1:400), or rabbit

Assessment of lesion volume
Cerebral lesion size was assessed using the TTC staining
method [29]. Animals were anesthetised with 10% chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg, i.p.) at 35 days after pMCAO, and their brains were
removed and sectioned into consecutive 2 mm-thick coronal slices
using a mould (RBM-4000C, ASI Instruments, Warren, MI,
USA). The slices were immediately immersed into 1% TTC
medium at 37uC for 15 min and then turned over for another
15 min. The stained slices were washed in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) for 5 min and then fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde
solution for 24 h. At the end of staining and fixation, colour
images of these slices were captured using a video camera
(PowerShot S60, Canon, Tokyo, Japan). The lesion volume was
analysed using Image Pro Plus software. The percentage lesion
volume was calculated as follows: [(VC–VL)/2VC]6100, where VC

anti-vWF antibody (1:400) at 4uC overnight and subsequently with
secondary antibody FITC-conjugated Affinipure donkey antimouse IgG (1:500) or FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(1:1000) at room temperature for 2 h. The sections were covered
with coverslips for microscope observation after antibody incubation. Fluorescent microscopic images were obtained with a
computer-driven microscope (Leica DMLB, Solms, Germany)
and using Leica Qwin V3 software (Leica Corporation). The
immunopositive cells were counted in three non-overlapping fields
under a high magnification (6200) fluorescent microscope by an
observer blinded to the individual treatments. The number of
positively labelled cells in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ,
adjacent to the ischemic core area) of the cortex was averaged in
three random sections taken from each animal.

Results
Monitoring of the physiological parameters
Blood pressure, heart rate and tcPO2 were monitored; however,
no notable influence was observed after the administration of Lserine, D-cycloserine, or a combination of L-serine and Dcycloserine (data no shown).

L-Serine treatment reduced the lesion volume and
neuronal loss
Thirty-five days after pMCAO, the injured brain tissue became
liquefied and was easily lost after being sectioned because of
liquefaction, but measurement of the lesion volume was not
influenced (Fig. 1A). L-serine treatment notably reduced the lesion
volume, and the brain tissue loss during sectioning was less in the
L-serine-treated group than in the vehicle group (p,0.05, Fig. 1A
and B).
Moreover, neuronal loss was evident at the core of injured
cortex, but many residual neurons were found in the IBZ (Fig. 2Ac and B), and more residual neurons were found in the L-serinetreated group than in the vehicle group (p,0.05, Fig. 2A-d and B).

L-serine administration
Rats were randomly divided into three groups except those
specified elsewhere: sham-operated group, vehicle group, and Lserine treated group. L-serine was dissolved in normal saline, and
treatment with L-serine (168 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) or vehicle
was started at 3 h after pMCAO and repeated every 12 h for 7
days or until the end of the experiment. D-cycloserine was used to
inhibit serine hydroxymethyltransferase [30,31]. D-cycloserine was
dissolved in normal saline and injected intraperitoneally at 5 mg/
kg and 15 mg/kg body weight just before each use of L-serine.

L-Serine treatment improved the recovery of
neurological functions
Except for those in the sham-operated group, the rats in other
two groups displayed severe neurological deficits after pMCAO,
neurological severity scores were increased prominently at 24 h
after pMCAO surgery (Fig. 3) and decreased gradually from day 3
to day 35 after pMCAO (p,0.05 or 0.01, Fig. 3). Compared with
vehicle rats, however, neurological severity scores were reduced
significantly by L-serine treatment (Fig. 3). On day 35 after
pMCAO, the mean value of NSS was 2.7160.18 in the L-serine
treated group, being lower than that of 4.2560.16 in the vehicle
group (p,0.01, Fig. 3).
In addition, the learning and memory abilities of rats were
measured before and after pMCAO. Before pMCAO, the learning
and memory abilities did not display any significant differences in
all three groups (Fig. 4A and B). After pMCAO, the time to find
the platform during the training days (day 8 to day 12) was
prolonged remarkably, and the time to enter the platform location

Statistics
The data are presented as the mean 6 standard error. The
neurological severity score data were compared using the KruskalWallis rank-sum test and the extended t-test for post hoc
comparisons. The data from multiple groups were analysed using
one-way ANOVA and the Newman Keuls test for post hoc
comparisons. Other data of the two groups were analysed using
Student’s t-test. Differences with p values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

on the test day (day 13) was also prolonged compared with the
sham-operated group (p,0.01, Fig. 4C and D) or compared with
the pre-pMCAO values in the vehicle group, suggesting that the
learning and memory abilities of the rats were reduced after
pMCAO. However, L-serine treatment significantly decreased the
time to find the platform during the training days and the time to
enter the platform location on the test day (p,0.05 or 0.01, Fig. 4C
and D). Similarly, the time to find the platform on day 29 to day
33 (the training days) and the time to enter the platform location
on the test day (day 34) were both shortened by L-serine treatment
(p,0.05 or 0.01, Fig. 4E and F), suggesting that L-serine treatment
could improve the learning and memory abilities of the rats after
pMCAO.

and L-serine treatment further increased the number of BrdU+/
nestin+ cells in the IBZ of cortex 5 days after pMCAO (p,0.01,
Fig. 6), suggesting that the ischemic insult could activate the
proliferation of endogenous NSCs, and L-serine treatment can
facilitate this activated proliferation of endogenous NSCs.
To verify the mechanism underlying this facilitating effect of Lserine on the proliferation of endogenous NSCs, D-cycloserine was
used to inhibit serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). The
pathway of L-serine catabolism initiated by SHMT is the major
source of one-carbon groups, providing formyl groups for purine
synthesis and methyl groups for pyrimidine synthesis, the
remethylation of homocysteine and many other methylation

after pMCAO (p,0.01, Fig. 5), and L-serine treatment further
elevated the expression of GDNF, NGF, NCAM L1, TN-C, and
Nogo-A in the brain of the injured side (p,0.05 or 0.01, Fig. 5).
However, the expression of GDNF, NGF, and NCAM L1 in the
brain tissue contralateral to the injured side was not significantly
changed (Fig. 5).

L-Serine treatment increased the proliferation of NSCs

the effect of L-serine in a dose-dependent manner, whereas use of
D-cycloserine alone did not influence the number of BrdU+/
nestin+ NSCs (Fig. 6), suggesting that conversion of L-serine into
one-carbon groups through the SHMT-initiated L-serine catabolism pathway may be potentially involved in the facilitating effect
of L-serine on the proliferation of endogenous NSCs.

that the facilitating effect of L-serine treatment on endogenous
NSC proliferation and microvascular proliferation is potentially
mediated by the action of L-serine as a substrate for the
production of one-carbon groups used for purine and pyrimidine
synthesis [23]. The increase in the number of new-born neurons
differentiating from endogenous NSCs in the IBZ of cortex in
pMCAO rats after L-serine treatment may be not the direct action
of L-serine on neural differentiation and might relate to the
facilitating effect of L-serine treatment on endogenous NSC
proliferation because the SHMT inhibitor D-cycloserine inhibited
the increasing effect of L-serine treatment on the number of newborn neurons, and as a result, more NSCs could differentiate into
neurons.
In addition, the present study found that L-serine treatment
elevated the expression of five nerve growth related factors:
GDNF, NGF, NCAM L1, TN-C, and Nogo-A in the ischemic
brain tissue of rats after pMCAO. GDNF, an important

To investigate the mechanisms underlying the neurorestorative
effect of L-serine, we investigated the therapeutic effect of L-serine
on neurorepair, including neural stem cell proliferation and
differentiation and microvascular proliferation. We found that Lserine treatment facilitated the proliferation of endogenous NSCs
activated after pMCAO and increased the number of new-born
neurons differentiating from these NSCs in the IBZ of cortex in
pMCAO rats. Moreover, L-serine treatment increased the
microvascular proliferation in the IBZ of cortex. Thus, reconstruction of neurovascular units in the injured cortex after cerebral
ischemia would be facilitated after treatment with L-serine. These
results of L-serine treatment have not been previously reported.
Furthermore, to understand the mechanisms underlying the
facilitating effect of L-serine treatment on neurorepair, Dcycloserine, an inhibitor of SHMT was used. D-cycloserine
blunted the effects of L-serine treatment on NSC proliferation
and differentiation and microvascular proliferation. It is suggested

neurotrophic factor, has been demonstrated to promote the
survival of many neurons, neurite outgrowth, and synaptogenesis
[32,33]. Duan et al. found that GDNF may improve the
proliferation of endogenous NSCs in humans after cerebral
ischemia [34]. Moreover, exogenous GDNF may exert a
neuroprotective effect on the brain in different experimental
models of focal and global brain ischemia [33,35,36]. NGF is also
important for the survival, maintenance and regeneration of
specific neuronal populations in the adult brain [32,37]. Intracerebroventricular or intracerebral administration of NGF will
improve neurological recovery after cerebral ischemia or traumatic brain injury [38,39]. NCAM L1 has critical roles in axon
outgrowth and fasciculation, neuronal migration and survival, and
synaptic plasticity during nervous system development and
promotes regeneration in animal models of acute and chronic
injury of the adult nervous system [40–42]. In addition, some
studies have indicated that transplantation of embryonic stem cells
that express the NCAM L1 supported the regrowth of corticospinal axons, promoted spinal cord regeneration and improved
functional recovery after spinal cord injury [43–45].
TN-C, a major extracellular matrix glycoprotein of the CNS, is
strongly upregulated after injuries of the CNS, but its role in tissue
repair is not understood. Both regeneration promoting and
inhibiting roles of TN-C have been proposed, considering its
abilities to both support and restrict neurite outgrowth in vitro
[46,47]. However, a recent report by Chen et al. indicates that the
spontaneous recovery of locomotor functions after spinal cord
injury is impaired in adult TN-C-deficient (TN-C–/–) mice in
comparison with wild-type (TN-C+/+) mice. The impaired
recovery was associated with reduced sprouting of monaminergic
axons in the spinal cord and enhanced post-traumatic degeneration of corticospinal axons. The degeneration of corticospinal
axons in TN-C–/– mice was normalised to TN-C+/+ levels by
application of the alternatively spliced TN-C fibronectin type III
homologous domain D, and overexpression of this domain D via
adeno-associated virus in wild-type mice improved locomotor
recovery, increased monaminergic axons sprouting, and reduced
lesion scar volume after spinal cord injury [46]. Moreover, some
other studies indicate that TN-C supports the growth of axons
with appropriate receptors, including some integrins and F3/F11/
contactin [48–50]. The results reported by Abaskharoun et al.
suggest that phosphacan/receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase-f/
b and its ligand, tenascin-C, expressed by neural stem cells and
neurons derived from embryonic stem cells, may be important for
the therapeutic application in facilitating nervous tissue repair and
regeneration [51].
Therefore, increases in the expression of these four nerve
growth-related factors (GDNF, NGF, NCAM L1, and TN-C) after

L-serine treatment in pMCAO rats may help the brain tissue
produce a microenvironment better for the proliferation, survival,
and differentiation of NSCs and for the proliferation of
microvessels and, as a result, promote the reconstruction of
neurovascular units and the repair of the injured brain tissue and
improve the neurorestoration of rats. These are novel mechanisms
underlying the therapeutic effect of L-serine for the rats with
ischemic brain injury, in addition to the glycine receptor-mediated
neuroprotective mechanism and the endothelial apamin- and
charybdotoxin-sensitive Ca2+-activated K+ channels-mediated
vasodilation mechanism we reported previously [21,22]. Thereby,
combining with present results we reported here, we suggest that
L-serine might be a new candidate for the treatment of ischemic
brain injury because of its actions on multiple targets.
Nogo-A, the largest member of the Nogo family, generally
known as a neurite outgrowth inhibitor [52,53], is responsible for
inhibition of CNS regeneration. However, a recent study by
Pernet et al. demonstrated an effect of Nogo-A likely beneficial to
neuroregeneration, i.e., the axonal growth in the optic nerve
activated by the intraocular injection of the inflammatory
molecule Pam3Cys tended to be lower in Nogo-A knock-out mice
than in wild-type mice, and Nogo-A overexpression in retinal
ganglion cells in vivo or in the neuronal cell line F11 in vitro
promoted regeneration, demonstrating a positive, cell-autonomous
role for neuronal Nogo-A in the modulation of axonal regeneration [54]. Therefore, whether the increase in Nogo-A expression
after L-serine treatment in the present study is beneficial to
neuroregeneration and neurorestoration needs to be clarified in a
future study.
In conclusion, L-serine treatment in pMCAO rats can reduce
brain injury and facilitate neurorestoration which is partly
associated with the improvement of proliferation of NSCs and
microvessels, reconstruction of neurovascular units and resultant
neurorepair. The effects of L-serine on endogenous NSC
proliferation and microvascular proliferation are partly mediated
by the action of L-serine as a substrate for the production of onecarbon groups used for purine and pyrimidine synthesis and
modulation of the expression of some endogenous nerve growthrelated factors.
