Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a common condition associated with the development and/or worsening of age-related dementia. We previously reported persistent memory loss and neurodegeneration after CCH in
middle-aged rats. Statin-mediated neuroprotection has been reported after acute cerebral ischemia. Unknown,
however, is whether statins can alleviate the outcome of CCH. The present study investigated whether atorvastatin attenuates the cognitive and neurohistological outcome of CCH. Rats (12–15 months old) were trained in a
non-food-rewarded radial maze, and then subjected to CCH. Atorvastatin (10 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered
for 42 days or 15 days, beginning 5 h after the ﬁrst occlusion stage. Retrograde memory performance was
assessed at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of CCH, and expressed by “latency,” “number of reference memory errors”
and “number of working memory errors.” Neurodegeneration was then examined at the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Compared to sham, CCH caused profound and persistent memory loss in the vehicle-treated groups,
as indicated by increased latency (91.2% to 107.3%) and number of errors (123.5% to 2508.2%), effects from which
the animals did not spontaneously recover across time. This CCH-induced retrograde amnesia was completely
prevented by atorvastatin (latency: − 4.3% to 3.3%; reference/working errors: −2.5% to 45.7%), regardless of
the treatment duration. This effect was sustained during the entire behavioral testing period (5 weeks), even
after discontinuing treatment. This robust and sustained memory-protective effect of atorvastatin occurred in
the absence of neuronal rescue (39.58% to 56.45% cell loss). We suggest that atorvastatin may be promising for
the treatment of cognitive sequelae associated with CCH.

1. Introduction
Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is a condition in which the
amount of blood ﬂow that is delivered to the brain is not completely
interrupted, but gradually and permanently reduced, thus compromising the metabolic demand of brain tissue (de la Torre, 2009). Depending
on the severity of CCH, hypoxic/ischemic damage will occur in different
brain regions, with consequent cognitive/executive dysfunctions,
including attention deﬁcits, working memory loss, verbal communication disability, temporal confusion, and visuo-spatial disorientation
(Anderson and Arciniegas, 2010). As the aging population increases
worldwide, the importance of CCH emerges as a serious health problem.
In fact, CCH is a common denominator of several morbidities (or risk

factors) that are highly prevalent in the elderly, including chronic hypertension, chronic heart disease, atherosclerosis of the internal
carotid arteries (ICAs), diabetes mellitus, a sedentary lifestyle, and
smoking, among others.
CCH has been postulated to be causally related to the promotion of
dementia, including the sporadic type of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or
vascular dementia (VaD), which lead to progressive cognitive impairment (de la Torre, 2009; Zhao and Gong, 2014). Despite the importance
of reducing the impact of vascular risk factors in the genesis and evolution of aging-related dementia (de la Torre, 2009), the identiﬁcation of
pharmacological strategies that could mitigate the outcome triggered
experimentally by CCH might have therapeutic beneﬁt to humans
with chronic cerebrovascular insufﬁciency.
Statins comprise a family of compounds which pharmacological
properties may transcend their cholesterol-lowering effect to include
the treatment of vascular-related CNS disorders. Statins exert pleiotropic effects, including improvement in endothelial function, reduction

180

of oxidative stress and inﬂammation, suppression of apoptosis in endothelial cells, and stimulation of angiogenesis (Endres and Laufs, 2004;
Zhou and Liao, 2010). These pleiotropic effects of statins have been
suggested to underlie their beneﬁcial effects evaluated in the middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of focal cerebral ischemia. For
example, rosuvastatin reduced infarct size in mice, an effect that was
associated with the elevation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(eNOS) expression measured both in vitro and in vivo (Laufs et al.,
2002). In rats, ﬂuvastatin attenuated the learning deﬁcit, reduced
oxidative stress, and stimulated angiogenesis and neuritogenesis
(Shimamura et al., 2007). Under similar conditions, atorvastatin reduced infarct size, brain edema, and neurological deﬁcit, effects that
were attributed to reductions of oxidative stress and neuroinﬂammation (Saito et al., 2014). Other studies reported that statins improve cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) in rats (Yamada et al., 2000) and vasomotor
reactivity in humans (Giannopoulos et al., 2012). These data indicate
that statins may have therapeutic value to treat the outcomes of focal
cerebral ischemia.
However, whether statins can exert beneﬁcial effects under the experimental condition of CCH remains unexplored. Therefore, in the
present study we used the permanent, three-stage 4-VO/ICA model of
CCH (Barros et al., 2009; Ferreira et al., 2011; Pereira et al., 2012) to investigate whether atorvastatin, a highly lipophilic statin, can mitigate
the cognitive and neurodegenerative outcomes of CCH in middle-aged
rats. A well-trained, long-term retrograde memory protocol was used
to answer the following questions: (i) Does long-term atorvastatin
treatment prevent persistent memory loss (i.e., retrograde amnesia)
that is caused by CCH? (ii) Is the antiamnesic effect of atorvastatin
also evident after reducing the treatment duration? (iii) Can the
antiamnesic effect of atorvastatin be sustained long after treatment cessation? (iv) Does atorvastatin mitigate CCH-induced neuronal death in
the hippocampus and cerebral cortex?

2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Subjects
Middle-aged Wistar rats (inbred strain, 12–15 months old) were
housed under a controlled temperature (22 ± 1 °C) on a 12 h/12 h
light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 AM). The animals had free access to
tap water and a standard commercial chow diet (Nutrilab-CR1; Nuvital
Nutrients, Curitiba, PR, Brazil). The experimental procedures were approved by our Ethics Committee on Animal Experimentation (protocol
no. 137/2012).

2.2. Timeline of drug administration relative to three-stage 4-VO/ICA
surgery and behavioral testing
Fig. 1 schematically shows the entire experimental protocol.
Naive rats were trained for 15 days to learn the radial maze task
(see Section 2.5) and then assigned to different treatment groups
(Section 2.4). Three-stage 4-VO/ICA surgery, with an interstage interval
of 4 days (on days 0, 4, and 8) was then performed (for details, see
Section 2.3). After full recovery from anesthesia, drug treatments
began around 5 h after the ﬁrst occlusion stage (VAo) and continued
daily for 42 days (ﬁrst experiment) or 15 days (second experiment).
Retrograde memory performance was assessed in retention memory
trials (RMTs), which began 1 week after completing the 4-VO/ICA procedure (on day 15) and continued for next 4 weeks at a rate of 1 RMT/
week (on days 22, 29, 36, and 42). On the day after the last RMT, the
brains were removed for histological examination.

2.3. Four-vessel occlusion/internal carotid artery model of CCH
The rats were intramuscularly anesthetized with ketamine
(60 mg/kg) plus xylazine (10 mg/kg) and ﬁxed in a stereotaxic
frame. A 2 cm incision was made in the dorsal neck to access the ﬁrst
cervical vertebra. The tip of a unipolar electrode was then inserted in
the alar foramen and gently rotated until the presence of vigorous hemorrhage ensured rupture of the VA. The hemorrhage was immediately
staunched by a 3–4 mA electrical current, ensuring complete and irreversible bilateral VA occlusion (VAo; Day 0). Four days later (Day 4),
an incision was made in the ventral neck to expose the left ICA, which
was carefully dissected and permanently ligated using cotton thread.
This procedure was repeated on Day 8 for occlusion of the right ICA.
During surgery, core temperature was maintained around 37.5 °C by a
heating blanket. During the ﬁrst 2 to 3 h after each surgery stage, the
rats were maintained in a warming box (inner temperature, 30 ± 1
°C) to avoid eventual brain hypothermia (Seif el Nasr et al., 1992). The
animals that were assigned to the sham surgery groups were subjected
to the same surgical procedures as their counterparts but were not subjected to vessel occlusion.

2.4. Drug preparation and treatment
Atorvastatin (Citalor®, Pﬁzer, São Paulo, Brazil) was freshly prepared
before administration. One Citalor tablet (atorvastatin, 20 mg) was
readily dissolved in 2 ml of sterile 0.9% saline (vehicle) to a ﬁnal
concentration of 10 mg/ml, from which a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight
was administered by gavage in a volume of 1.0 ml/kg. This dose
was chosen based on previous works carried out either in mice
(Laufs et al., 2002; Gertz et al., 2003) or rats (Hong et al., 2006) subjected to cerebral ischemia. The animals were allocated to the following
treatments, as detailed in Table 1. After data collection and preliminary
analysis, the sham-operated groups in the 15-day treatment regimen
were pooled since their behavioral response did not differ from each
other.

Fig. 2. Schematic representation of the aversive, eight-arm radial maze (AvRM) apparatus.

2.5. Behavioral testing
2.5.1. Aversive radial maze
The aversive radial maze (AvRM, Fig. 2) is a nonfood-rewarded,
eight-arm radial maze that works on the basis of the rat's natural behavior of avoiding open, wide, and illuminated areas and its preference for
darkened and enclosed places, i.e., a goal box located just beneath the
opening at the distal end of a given arm of the maze. The AvRM consists
of a central, polygonal platform (71 cm across, 16 sides) elevated 90 cm
above the ﬂoor with eight arms (55 × 15 cm) that radiate outward from
alternate sides. At the end of each arm is a 9-cm diameter opening that
provides access to a goal box. Among the eight arms, however, only one
contains the true goal box (i.e., a darkened, closed-ended box,
23 × 11 × 9.5 cm), which can be moved from one arm to the other between trials. In the remaining seven arms, the boxes have walls like
the true goal box but lack the bottom (i.e., a false goal box). From a separate room, a pulley system connected to each individual guillotine door
allows the experimenter to conﬁne the animal in the central arena before release them to explore the arms. Several extra-maze cues (posters
on the walls, a closed door, and removable, 3-dimensional objects) were
available in the room. A small ventilator located on the ﬂoor generated
constant noise in the testing room throughout the experiment. Two
ﬂuorescent lamps of 56 W each were ﬁxed 80 cm above the maze. A
video camera was positioned 220 cm away from, and 130 cm above,
the maze. For descriptive data analysis, the 8 arms were numbered according to their location in relation to the extra-maze cues such that
the sequence and frequency of visits to each different location could
be recorded.

2.5.2. Preoperative training
Rats were evaluated in the AvRM task to assess their ability to remember the spatial location of the goal box (refuge/shelter) that was
learned during the training phase, prior to 4-VO/ICA surgeries or sham
operation (i.e., retrograde memory). Before training, the rats were habituated to the testing apparatus (4 min/day, for 3 days). Training was

181

given for 15 days (one session/day, three trials/session). On the beginning of each trial the rat was conﬁned in the central arena for 30 s,
and then allowed to explore the entire maze. After entering a wrong
arm, the other ones were closed. An arm was considered visited when
the rat had entered halfway down its length. Upon the rat's return to
the central arena, the newly visited arm was immediately closed, and
a further 10 s conﬁnement was applied. The rat was then released for
novel exploration, and so on. Once the correct arm was visited, it was
immediately closed, forcing the animal to enter the true shelter where
it was left for 1 min, and then returned to its home cage in a separate
room. Meantime, the maze was cleaned and randomly rotated on its
central axis, and the true shelter was randomly moved to any of the
other seven arms, but its spatial location remained constant. In each
trial, a 4-min cut-off period was given. If the rat did not ﬁnd the goal
box within that time, a novel trial began. The ability of the rats to
learn the goal box location was measured by three parameters: (i) the
latency to ﬁnd the goal box, (ii) the number of reference memory errors,
and (iii) the number of working memory errors. Within a given trial, a
reference memory error was recorded when the rat visited an arm
that contained a false shelter for the ﬁrst time. A working memory
error was recorded if the rat entered an arm that had been previously
visited within the same trial. Asymptotic learning was estimated by calculating the mean latency and mean number of errors observed across
the last 3 days of preoperative training. Animals with a mean latency
≥100 s were considered unable to learn the AvRM task and excluded.
Other minor details of the training procedure have been reported elsewhere (Ferreira et al., 2011; Pereira et al., 2012). Two to 4 days after
the end of training, the rats were subjected to 4-VO/ICA or sham
surgery.
2.5.3. Postoperative retention trials
Seven days after the induction of permanent 4-VO/ICA, the assessment of retrograde memory performance began. Postoperative retention memory trials (RMTs) were conducted 15, 22, 29, 36, and 42 days
after 4-VO/ICA, with one RMT per week (Fig. 1) and performed using
the same procedure as during preoperative training, except the habituation phase.
2.6. Histology
The methodological procedure followed as described in details previously (Godinho et al., 2015; Romanini et al., 2015). Under anesthesia
(thiopental, 50 mg/kg, i.v.) the animal was transcardially perfused
with 0.9% saline followed by Bouin's ﬁxative (20 ml/min for 5 min).
The head was immersed in crushed ice (1–2 °C) for 2 h, after which
the brains were processed for parafﬁn embedment. For each brain, six
coronal sections (7 μm thick, 70 μm apart) were cut at the medial
level of the hippocampus (3.60–4.30 mm from bregma) and processed
for Nissl staining. Three adjacent coronal sections were examined
(Olympus BX 41 microscope, Tokyo, Japan) for the number of surviving,
normal-looking pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, retrosplenial (RS)
and parietal association (PtA) cortex in both hemispheres (see Fig. 3
for an outline of these brain regions). Large neurons that showed a
well-delimited, spherical form with a distinct nucleus and nucleolus
were counted as being viable pyramidal neurons. Neurons that had
shrunken, dark-stained cell bodies, sometimes with surrounding
empty spaces, were excluded as being degenerating cells. Given the
scattered pattern and miscellaneous types of cells in the cerebral cortex,
digital microscopic areas (361 × 270 μm; 40× objective) were captured
from the RS and PtA regions under an identical microscopic light intensity (high-performance charge-coupled device camera, QColor, Ontario,
Canada). In each digitally captured area, viable neurons were manually
marked by clicking the computer mouse, and their summation was provided automatically. For the RS cortex, a mean value was obtained from
six measurements (3 sections × 2 hemispheres × 1 area) for each rat. In
the PtA cortex, 12 measurements were performed (3 sections × 2

182

hemispheres × 2 areas). In the hippocampus, because the length of the
CA1 to CA4 segment, cell count was performed directly by microscopy
with the aid of a mechanical cell counter. This was facilitated by the regular, well deﬁned pyramidal cell stratum. In each rat, a mean value of
hippocampal cells across the CA1–CA4 subﬁelds was calculated from
six measurements (2 hemispheres × 3 sections). In each individual,
cell counts in each region were averaged from the various measurements and transformed into a percentage, with the mean of the respective sham-operated groups set to 100%.
2.7. Statistical analysis
SAS 9.4 software was used. When retrograde memory performance
was examined across time, the linear mixed effects modeling was applied for the analysis of longitudinal data (Verbeke and Molenberghs,
2000), and the autoregressive order 1 (AR1) covariance structure was
chosen based on the following information criteria: (i) log Likelihood
ratio test, (ii) Akaike information criterion (AIC), and (iii) Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey–Kramer's multiple-range test was
then performed to quantify memory performance across the various
RMTs (Fig. 1), with Group as the between-subjects factor and Trial as
the within-subjects factor. When memory performance was expressed
as the total latency and total number of errors (summed across the various RMTs), a one-way ANOVA was used to compare groups during the
RMT phase. For within-group comparisons of the total latency and total
number of errors that were measured prior to and after CCH, Student's
paired t-test was used. To estimate the power test, the approximated
non-central F distribution was used with a signiﬁcance level of 5%. The
generalized linear model with a gamma distribution was used for the
analysis of the histological data. The data were expressed as mean ±
SEM, and differences were considered signiﬁcant at p b 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Pre-operative/treatment learning performance
Fig. 3 shows the latency to ﬁnd the goal box, and the number of reference and working memory errors in intact animals during the 15 days
of training, before any surgery and/or treatment. There was no difference between the groups allocated in each treatment (42-day treatment
groups: F2,34 = 0.69–1.78, p N 0.05; 15-day treatment groups: F2,27 =
0.02–1.01, p N 0.05). In contrast, there was signiﬁcant training (Days) effects in all parameters (42-day treatment groups: F14, 476 = 8.94–27.62,
p b 0.0001; 15-day treatment groups: F14,378 = 5.04–13.95, p b 0.0001).
Group vs. Day interaction appeared only in the 42-day treatment
groups for the parameters latency and reference errors (F28,476 =
2.07–2.32, p b 0.001–0.01). These data indicate that during the preoperative training, the animals learned the task very well, and the rate at
which behavioral performance improved across time was similar in all
groups.
3.2. Atorvastatin rescue retrograde memory performance after CCH
Fig. 4 shows the effect of atorvastatin on retrograde amnesia that
was caused by CCH in middle-aged rats. The loss of well-trained, retrograde memory is reﬂected by sustained increases in both the latency
and number of errors during each individual RMT (left panels) and
cumulatively over the various RMTs (right panels). The analysis of
the temporal distribution of memory performance (left panels) revealed a signiﬁcant main effect of Group on all three parameters
at both 42-day (F2,33–34 = 14.67–20.96.77, p b 0.0001) and 15-day
(F2,27–28 = 13.29–19.33, p b 0.0001) regimens. A signiﬁcant main
effect of Trial was not found for any of the three parameters (42 days:
F4,95–102 = 0.24–2.15, p = 0.08–0.91; 15 days: F4,75–82 = 1.59–1.97,
p = 0.11–0.19), although progressive memory deterioration was

evident in the group receiving vehicle for 42 days (left panel). Compared to sham, the groups that were subjected to CCH and treated
with vehicle for 42 or 15 days spent 107.3% or 91.2% more time ﬁnding
the goal box (i.e., latency), respectively, and committed 253.4% or

Retention memory trials (RMT) were conducted 15, 22, 29, 37, and 42 days after CCH to assess retrograde memory performance. Atorvastatin or vehicle was administered daily for 42 or 15 days, starting on the day of the ﬁrst
surgical stage. (Left panels) Temporal distribution of memory performance expressed as latency, number of reference memory errors, and number of working memory errors in each

123.5% more reference memory errors, and 2508.2% or 629.7% more
working memory errors (Tukey–Kramer multiple-range test, p b
0.0001 vehicle vs. sham). Both latency and memory errors registered
after CCH + vehicle was at the level of those measured during the
ﬁrst preoperative training trials (Fig. 3), indicating a total loss of
memory.
The loss of memory that was caused by CCH was also evident when
memory performance was represented as the total (cumulative) latency
and total number of errors (right panels, p b 0.0001, vehicle vs. sham).
Additionally, a within-group analysis compared the total latency and
total number of errors prior to and after CCH (right panels). This analysis
revealed that all three parameters consistently increased from preoperative training to postoperative RMTs in the CCH/vehicle groups
(42 days: t = − 5.59 to − 3.73, df = 27–34, p b 0.0001–0.001;
15 days: t = − 5.29 to − 4.07, p b 0.0001–0.01). These parameters
remained unchanged, however, in the respective sham-operated
groups (t = 0.02–0.92, df = 27–34, p N 0.05).

These results indicate that the rats that were subjected to CCH and
treated with vehicle “forgot” the task that was previously learned during the training phase (Fig. 3), a sequelae from which they did not spontaneously recover over time, reﬂecting a state of persistent retrograde
amnesia. This CCH-induced retrograde amnesia in the vehicle group
was completely absent in the atorvastatin-treated groups; notably,
throughout the RMTs, memory performance after atorvastatin treatment was at the same level as the sham-operated groups (latency:
− 4.3% or 3.3%; reference memory errors: 7.5% or − 2.5%; working
memory errors: 43.2% or 45.7%) regardless of whether atorvastatin
was administered for 42 or 15 days (left panels, Tukey–Kramer test,
p b 0.0001; right panels, t-test, p b 0.0001, atorvastatin vs. vehicle).
The power test (1 − β) revealed a less than 1% probability of committing a type II error (i.e., to accept the null hypothesis when it is false).
This implies that the null hypothesis was correctly rejected with a probability greater than 99%, regardless of parameter (i.e., latency and number of errors) and treatment duration (42 and 15 days). Altogether,

184

these values indicate a robust antiamnesic effect of atorvastatin, which
was sustained throughout the experiment, even after the discontinuation of treatment (15-day regimen).
3.3. Atorvastatin failed to prevent neurodegeneration after CCH
The results of the histological analysis are illustrated in Fig. 5. The
degree of pyramidal cell death that was caused by CCH in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was deduced from the reduction of the
number of viable neurons relative to the sham-operated groups. The effect of atorvastatin thereon was determined to indicate the presence or
absence of neuroprotection (i.e., neuronal rescue). Viable pyramidal
cells were counted along the CA1–CA4 subﬁelds of the hippocampus
and RS and PtA cortices. Compared with the respective shamoperated groups, the groups that were subjected to CCH and treated
with vehicle for either 42 or 15 days had signiﬁcant and very similar
neuronal death in the hippocampus (47.10% or 41.70% cell loss,
χ2(2) = 25.68–35.56, p b 0.0001), RS cortex (51.90% or 52.74% cell
loss, χ2(2) = 26.19–41.85, p b 0.0001), and PtA cortex (46.53% or
54.44% cell loss, χ2(2) = 22.33–42.45, p b 0.0001).
Compared with vehicle, atorvastatin failed to afford neuronal rescue
in both the hippocampus (47.31% or 39.58% cell loss; χ2(1) = 0–0.12,
p N 0.05), RS cortex (47.47% or 56.45%; χ2(1) = 0.44–0.57, p N 0.05),
and PtA cortex (48.36% or 51.35%; χ2(1) = 0.06–0.41, p N 0.05), regardless of the treatment duration. Altogether, the behavioral and histological data indicate that the memory-protective effect of atorvastatin
occurred in the absence of neurohistological protection in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.
4. Discussion
In the present study we aimed to determine whether atorvastatin
was efﬁcacious in protecting against spatial memory loss and neurodegeneration that were caused by CCH in middle-aged rats. Our results
clearly demonstrate that daily atorvastatin treatment, started at 5 h
after the ﬁrst stage of 4-VO/ICA, prevents the loss of memory completely, an effect that was sustained for the entire period of behavioral testing, even after discontinuing treatment (Fig. 4). In contrast, the extent
of neuronal death that was measured in the hippocampus and cerebral
cortex was not alleviated by atorvastatin, regardless of the treatment
duration (42 or 15 days, Fig. 5). The persistent retrograde amnesia and

the pattern of neuronal death observed here after permanent, 3-stage
4-VO/ICA replicated our previous ﬁndings (Pereira et al., 2012;
Romanini et al., 2013; Godinho et al., 2015), indicating that both the
4-VO/ICA model of CCH and the AvRM task are reliable paradigms for investigating learning/memory dysfunction and neurodegeneration related to CCH. Although neuronal death was not altered by atorvastatin, its
efﬁcacy in protecting retrograde memory after CCH indicated that it
reached the brain in sufﬁcient amounts. This supposition is further supported by the favorable pharmacokinetic of atorvastatin, mainly its high
lipophilicity (Sirtori, 2014) and potential blood–brain barrier permeability (Sierra et al., 2011).
The potential beneﬁts of statins under the experimental conditions of
CCH have not been investigated previously, so we are unable to compare
the present results with previous ﬁndings. The present data are consistent, however, with a previous meta-analysis of the effects of statins in
rodent models of focal cerebral ischemia. Overall, statins were reported
to facilitate functional recovery in association with a reduction of infarct
size (García-Bonilla et al., 2012). In the present study, atorvastatin also
facilitated memory recovery (or its preservation) but failed to prevent
hippocampal and cortical neurodegeneration after CCH. Despite the
lack of comparable data, one possible explanation for the lack of neuronal
rescue by atorvastatin in the present study concerns the length of survival until histology was performed. In previous studies, statin-mediated
neuroprotection was evaluated at 24 h (Amin-Hanjani et al., 2001;
Zhou and Liao, 2010) or 7 days after focal cerebral ischemia (Saito
et al., 2014). Here, the rats survived up to 43 days after 4-VO/ICA, and
the lack of neuroprotection by atorvastatin was similar to that of
cilostazol after CCH (Godinho et al., 2015). Similar results were also reported for ﬁsh oil using the same treatment protocol in rats that were
subjected to TGCI (Ferreira et al., 2014; Bacarin et al., 2013). We presumed that both cilostazol and ﬁsh oil may have afforded some degree
of neuronal rescue, but such an effect may not be sustained for 43 days
after the ischemic insult. If true, then the same may have occurred with
atorvastatin in the present study. Such interpretation make sense in
view of the observation that different drugs that have provided neuronal
rescue after transient cerebral ischemia were no longer effective when
the postischemic survival time of the analysis extended from the ﬁrst
7 days to 30 days (Corbett and Crooks, 1997). As stated elsewhere, however, “while it is obviously important to preserve as many neurons as
possible after an ischemic insult it is clear that protection must also
mean preservation of function” (Corbett and Nurse, 1998). Therefore,

the lack of histological neuroprotection does not diminish the potential
utility of atorvastatin (and perhaps other statins) in the setting of CCH.
The ability of atorvastatin to prevent retrograde amnesia in the absence of neuronal rescue is striking since the hippocampus and cerebral
cortex are required for processing remote, retrograde memory in the radial maze task (Ramos, 2008, 2009; Haijima and Ichitani, 2008;
Schlesiger et al., 2013). This raises the issue of how atorvastatin prevents CCH-induced retrograde amnesia independently of neuronal rescue in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Retrograde amnesia
implies that a memory trace that was formed and consolidated during
preoperative training (see Fig. 3) was lost after CCH (Fig. 4). Our interpretation is that the neuronal network that underlies such memory survived the initial CCH but became functionally impaired afterward.
Dysfunctional synapse has been observed in models of CCH (Zhao and
Gong, 2014). Therefore, we can suppose that the effect of atorvastatin
on preserving memory should rely on an improvement in the functionality of that neuronal network. A similar rationale was used to explain
the memory-protective effect of erythropoietin in the absence of neuronal rescue in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and striatum after global
cerebral ischemia (Undén et al., 2013). If this is true, then another question is how atorvastatin improves (or preserves) the functionality of
such a neuronal substrate. This issue was not addressed experimentally
in the present study, but we can speculate that three main pleiotropic
effects of statins, alone or in combination, may have played a role:
(i) improvement or maintenance of cerebrovascular reserve, (ii) reduction of oxidative stress, and (iii) reduction of neuroinﬂammation.
Statin-mediated pleiotropism is thought to result from the inhibition
of isoprenoid formation, mainly farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and
genranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which are downstream of the
mevalonic acid in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. By depleting
the levels of FPP and GGPP, statins reduce (or block) the protein
isoprenylation process (i.e., the covalent addition of either farnesyl or
geranylgeranyl moieties to certain proteins, including the intracellular
small guanosine triphosphatase [GTPase] signaling molecules Ras, Rho,
Rac, and Rap). Without FPP/GGPP-mediated isoprenylation, these cytosolic proteins (inactive state) cannot bind to the plasma membrane
(active state), thus interrupting their downstream signaling steps
(Endres and Laufs, 2004; Raz et al., 2010).
When activated, Rho protein negatively regulates the expression/activity of eNOS and availability of NO. By reducing the levels of
isoprenoids, statins inhibit Rho and its downstream effector ROCK
(Rho kinase C) which, in turn, results in the upregulation of eNOS and
increased NO availability. This well characterized pleiotropic effect of
statins, together with the stimulation of angiogenesis, the reduction of
smooth cell proliferation/migration, the secretion of extracellular matrix proteins, macrophage migration, phagocitosis, and foam cell formation have been proposed to be a main mechanism by which statins
improve vascular function in the setting of cardiovascular disease
(Zhou and Liao, 2010). These effects of statins might translate to the
ﬁeld of cerebral ischemia. The direct inhibition of ROCK by fasudil reduced cerebrovascular resistance, improved tissue perfusion, and alleviated anoxic depolarization in the peri-infarct zone, effects that were
attributed to improved collateral ﬂow after reductions of vascular
tone, blood viscosity, leukocyte adhesion, and platelet activation (Shin
et al., 2014). These ﬁndings suggest that the statin-mediated preservation of eNOS activity in cerebral vasculature may be especially important in preserving blood ﬂow and limiting neurological/cognitive
impairment after a hypoxic/ischemic insult. On this basis, it is possible
that atorvastatin that is administered beginning in the early stage of
4-VO/ICA may preserve or improve the cerebrovascular reserve, compensating for the negative inﬂuence of CCH on the functional state of
the neuronal network that survives CCH, thus protecting against the deterioration of retrograde memory.
The reduction of oxidative stress may represent another way in
which atorvastatin preserves retrograde memory following CCH. The
activation of NADPH-oxidase (Nox) and subsequent generation of

185

reactive oxygen species (ROS) comprise a major signaling pathway
that lies downstream of the GTPase Rac1. The antioxidant property of
atorvastatin at least partially relies on the inhibition of Rac1
isoprenylation (Endres and Laufs, 2004; Zhou and Liao, 2010; Raz
et al., 2010). Nox1 expression was elevated during the ﬁrst week of
2VO-induced CCH and gradually increased over time (Choi et al.,
2014). In rats that were subjected to transient, global cerebral ischemia
(TGCI), Nox activation and the production of anion superoxide (O−
2 )
were strongly reduced by the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766, effects that
were followed by the prevention of memory deﬁcits at 7–9 days of reperfusion (Raz et al., 2010). Mice with targeted deletion of the Rac1
gene exhibited less blood–brain barrier breakdown, less brain edema,
and smaller infarct volume after MCAO (Sawada et al., 2009). These
last two studies agree in that the direct inactivation of the GTPase
Rac1 is associated with alleviation of both oxidative stress and the clinical outcome of cerebral ischemia. Interestingly, deletion of the Nox1
gene also alleviated the blood–brain barrier disruption after MCAO, an
effect that was shared by both apocynin (a nonspeciﬁc Nox inhibitor)
and atorvastatin (an inhibitor of Rac1 isoprenylation) (Kahles et al.,
2007). Furthermore, the Nox inhibitor apocynin reduced oxidative
stress after CCH and consequently ameliorated memory dysfunction
(Choi et al., 2014). Apocynin also prevented retrograde amnesia in the
AvRM task in rats subjected to TGCI (Romanini et al., 2015), an effect
that was very similar to that of atorvastatin in the present study
(Fig. 4). Further, atorvastatin (Liptor, 10 mg/kg sc) administered preventively was reported to reduce both NADPH oxidase activity, the
levels of superoxide, and infarct size in rats subjected to MCAO (Hong
et al., 2006). Altogether, these ﬁndings suggest that an antioxidant action of atorvastatin at least partially accounts for its antiamnesic effect
after CCH.
Finally, the anti-inﬂammatory properties of atorvastatin (PinhoGomes et al., 2014) may also contribute to its beneﬁcial effect on memory after CCH. Inﬂammation may be involved in the process of white
matter lesions (WML), an outcome that is commonly reported in the
2VO model of CCH (Farkas et al., 2007). Also in older people, and especially those with CCH and cognitive impairments, WMLs may range
from demyelination to complete axonal disruption, negatively impacting
a wide spectrum of cognitive functions, such as memory, processing
speed, attention, and executive function (Bolandzadeh et al., 2012). Increased glial cell response and TNF-α levels (Lee et al., 2006; Watanabe
et al., 2006) as well as matrix metalloproteinases activity (Lakhan et al.,
2009; Nakaji et al., 2006) provide evidence of the role of inﬂammation
in WMLs following CCH. Whether atorvastatin (or other statins) can prevent CCH-induced WMLs is unknown. Nonetheless, evidence in that direction is provided by the results obtained with other experimental
paradigms, including traumatic spinal cord injury (Pannu et al., 2007),
neonatal cerebral hypoxia (Li et al., 2010), middle cerebral artery stenosis in humans (Mok et al., 2009), and preventive treatment for secondary
stroke (Xiong et al., 2014). Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that
statins are able to prevent WMLs after cerebral hypoxia/ischemia. Therefore, atorvastatin may have prevented WMLs that may occur after 4-VO/
ICA, thus contributing to the preservation of retrograde memory.
5. Conclusions
The present study shows that atorvastatin markedly attenuated retrograde amnesia in middle-aged rats that were subjected to 4-VO/ICAinduced CCH. This effect endured even after the discontinuation of treatment and occurred in the absence of neuronal rescue. We therefore suggest that atorvastatin may have therapeutic utility for treating cognitive
outcome of CCH. Additional studies should investigate, for example,
whether doses lower than the one used herein are equally effective in
reducing memory loss after CCH. Another issue is whether atorvastatin
can be effective when treatment is delayed for hours or days after CCH.
Also, the mechanisms by which atorvastatin preserves retrograde memory after CCH remain to be systematically investigated.
