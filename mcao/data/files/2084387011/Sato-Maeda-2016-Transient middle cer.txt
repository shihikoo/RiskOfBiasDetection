was investigated in mouse brains subjected to 60 min of transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (tMCAO). Male C57BL6/j mice underwent tMCAO through the intraluminal
blockade of MCA. Expression of the Rnf213 gene in the tMCAO brain was investigated
with in situ RNA hybridization and a real-time PCR analysis from 1 to 72 h after tMCAO. In
situ RNA hybridization revealed a signiﬁcant increase in Rnf213 mRNA levels in the cerebral
cortex supplied by the affected MCA, especially at the penumbra area, as early as 6 h after
tMCAO, and these levels had increased further by 24 h. Rnf213 gene expression remained
unchanged in the non-ischemic hemisphere or control specimens. Double staining of
Rnf213 mRNA with NeuN immunohistochemistry revealed Rnf213 hybridization signal
expression mostly in neurons. The real-time PCR analysis conﬁrmed induction of the
Rnf213 gene after tMCAO. Therefore, the Rnf213 gene was up-regulated in the ischemic
brain, especially at the penumbra area, 6 h after tMCAO. Early increases in RNF213 gene
expression in neurons after tMCAO indicate its involvement in cerebral ischemia, which is
an underlying pathology of MMD. Further investigation is required to clarify its exact role
in the pathophysiology of MMD.

Introduction

Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a progressive occlusive cerebrovascular disease that is characterized by bilateral stenoocclusive changes at the terminal portion of the internal
carotid artery (ICA) and an abnormal vascular network at the
base of the brain (Suzuki and Takaku, 1969). Although the
etiology of MMD remains unknown, recent advances have
been made in understanding its molecular biology and
pathophysiology, and new genetic mutations and deletions
have been identiﬁed (Kamada et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011).
Recent genome-wide and locus-speciﬁc association studies
identiﬁed the RING ﬁnger protein 213 (RNF213) in the 17q25ter region as a susceptibility gene for MMD among East Asian
populations (Kamada et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011; Fujimura
et al., 2014). We previously reported that the singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of c.14576G4A, p. R4859K in
the RNF213 gene was detected in 95% of cases of familial
MMD and 79% of sporadic cases (Kamada et al., 2011).
Furthermore, patients with the homozygous mutation pattern of SNP in the RNF213 gene had an earlier disease onset
and more severe clinical presentation of MMD, suggesting
that the RNF213 gene polymorphism is an important prognostic factor of MMD (Miyatake et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2015).
A quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) analysis revealed that constitutive expression
of the RNF213 gene was very low in adult and embryonic
brain tissue (Kamada et al., 2011). However, information
regarding temporal and spatial expression patterns of the

51

RNF213 gene under the condition of cerebral ischemia, which
is one of characteristic pathologies associated with MMD, is
currently limited (Fujimura and Tominaga, 2015). In order to
address this important issue, we investigated Rnf213 mRNA
expression in mouse brains subjected to transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO).

Results

2.1.
Rnf213 mRNA was up-regulated in the ischemic
hemisphere after tMCAO
The spatio-temporal expression patterns of Rnf213 mRNA
after tMCAO were shown in Fig. 1. Each window in Fig. 1A
denotes the positions of images in Fig. 1C: windows 2–4 were
in the ischemic hemisphere (the right side in Fig. 1B), and
window 1 was located in the non-ischemic hemisphere
similar to the position of window 2. In control brains,
Rnf213 mRNA expression was barely detected (numbers of
brains examined, n ¼3), which is consistent with our previous
reverse transcription PCR ﬁndings (Kamada et al., 2011).
Rnf213 mRNA was signiﬁcantly up-regulated as early as 6 h
after reperfusion in the entire MCA territory on the ischemic
hemisphere (n¼ 4), including the ischemic cortex, striatum,
and ventral cortex (Fig. 1C, 6 h), whereas Rnf213 mRNA was
barely detected in the non-ischemic hemisphere or ischemic
hemisphere 3 h after reperfusion (n ¼3) (Fig. 1C, Control and
3 h). Rnf213 mRNA expression was the most prominent in the
ischemic penumbra cortex (Fig. 1C). The Rnf213 mRNA signal

schematic representation of a coronal brain section at the level of the striatum. Each window denotes the positions of images
in (C): windows 2–4 are in the ischemic hemisphere (the right side in (B)), and window 1 is located in the normal hemisphere
similar to the position of window 2. (B): A Nissl-stained coronal section at the level of the striatum. (C) Images of the in situ
hybridization of Rnf213 mRNA expression. Four images at each time point were taken from a single coronal section. The upregulated expression of Rnf213 mRNA was observed in the ischemic cortex, especially in window 2, 6 h after reperfusion (6 h).
Gene expression increased at 24 h, but decreased by 72 h. (C): Two serial sections of the ischemic brain at 24 h, to which an
Rnf213 sense probe or anti-sense probe (right) were applied (left). The up-regulated expression of Rnf213 in the ischemic
hemisphere was not detected in sections to which a sense probe was applied. Scale bars: 100 lm in C, 200 lm in C and D.

52

had further increased at 24 h (n ¼7): intense gene expression
was the most prominent in the cerebral cortex in the
ischemic hemisphere (Fig. 1C, 24 h), but not in that in the
non-ischemic hemisphere (Fig. 1C, window-1). This distinctive expression pattern was not evident in the ischemic
hemisphere at 24 h with the Rnf213 control sense probe
(n ¼7; Fig. 1D). By 72 h (n¼ 2), the distinct gene expression
pattern in the cortex was not detected any longer, though the
expression was still detected in the entire MCA territory in
the ischemic cortex (window 3 in Fig. 1C).

2.2.
Up-regulation of Rnf213 mRNA in the ischemic
hemisphere was conﬁrmed quantitatively by real-time PCR
We quantitatively evaluated changes in Rnf213 gene expression using a real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA prepared from
the ischemic cerebral hemispheres of tMCAO mice was
subjected to quantitative real-time PCR in order to determine
Rnf213 mRNA levels. mRNA levels at each time point were
shown relative to those in control (sham) brains (Fig. 2). The
results obtained demonstrated that Rnf213 gene expression at
1 h was similar to that in control brains, and was slightly upregulated at 3 h. The distinctive up-regulation of gene expression was then observed at 6 h, and was sustained up to 24
and 72 h: mRNA levels at 6 h and 24 h were 1.5-fold higher
than control levels.

2.3.
Double staining of Rnf213 mRNA with NeuN, GFAP,
and TdT-mediated dUTP-binding nick end-labeling (TUNEL)
The pattern of Rnf213 mRNA-expressing cells (Rnf213(þ) cells)
was analyzed in relation to the distribution of anti-NeuNlabeled neurons (NeuN(þ) cells), apoptotic cells detected by
TUNEL (TUNEL(þ) cells), and anti-GFAP-labeled glial cells
(GFAP(þ) cells).

Fig. 2 – Total RNA prepared from the ischemic hemisphere of
mouse brains was subjected to quantitative RT-PCR in order
to determine the level of Rnf213 mRNA relative to that of ßactin mRNA. mRNA levels at each time point were shown
relative to those in control (sham) brains. ns: no signiﬁcant
difference, **po0.01.

At 6 h, scattered Rnf213(þ)/NeuN(þ) cells and Rnf213
(þ)/TUNEL(þ) cells were observed in the MCA territory cortex
of the ischemic hemisphere (Fig. 3A). Higher magniﬁcation
images at 6 h (Fig. 3B) showed that most Rnf213(þ) cells were
NeuN(þ) cells. Furthermore, we found two patterns of Rnf213
(þ)/NeuN(þ) cells at 6 h: one was cells labeled by NeuN with a
higher intensity (white arrowheads in Fig. 3B), and the other
was cells with faint NeuN labeling and sometimes with a
shrunken morphology (white arrows in Fig. 3B). We also
found some Rnf213(þ)/TUNEL( ) cells at 6 h (red arrowheads
in Fig. 3B) as well as Rnf213(þ)/TUNEL(þ) cells (red arrows in
Fig. 3B).
However, Rnf213(þ) cells with an intense NeuN(þ) signal
were barely detected at 24 h. Faint NeuN(þ) signals were
observed within the area in which cells with dense Rnf213(þ)
signals were located (the area with a bracket in Fig. 3C).
Higher magniﬁcation images revealed that Rnf213(þ) cells
with a dense signal at 24 h frequently showed faint NeuN
labeling (white arrows in Fig. 3D). On the other hand, Rnf213
(þ)/TUNEL(þ) cells appeared in the wider area in the cortex at
24 h (Fig. 3C), and the area of dense Rnf213(þ) signals showed
only few overlaps with the GFAP(þ) glial cell population
(Fig. 3C and D).

Discussion

The present study demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time, that the
mRNA of RNF213; a susceptibility gene for MMD, was signiﬁcantly up-regulated in affected neurons as early as 6 h
after transient focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. In
light of the relatively lower expression of the Rnf213 gene in
the mouse brain under normal physiological conditions
(Kamada et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011), the distinctive induction
of the Rnf213 gene after an ischemic insult, as shown in the
present study, appears to be unique. Furthermore, the colocalization of Rnf213 mRNA expression with TUNEL-positive
neurons suggests that the Rnf213 gene plays a role in cell
survival and/or cell death in neural tissue under cerebral
ischemia, which is an underlying pathology of MMD.
MMD is a chronic, occlusive cerebrovascular disease with an
unknown etiology that is characterized by a unique and dynamic
nature to convert the vascular supply to the cerebral hemisphere
from the internal carotid (IC) system to the external carotid (EC)
system, a so-called ‘IC-EC conversion disease’ (Fujimura and
Tominaga, 2015). The insufﬁciency of this ‘IC-EC conversion system’
may result in cerebral ischemia as well as intracranial hemorrhage due to an inadequate collateral vascular network, both of
which represent the clinical presentation of MMD. Abnormal
vascular networks, so-called ‘moyamoya vessels’, play an important role during the transitional state of ‘IC-EC conversion’ by
compensating for ischemic conditions (Suzuki and Takaku, 1969;
Fujimura and Tominaga., 2015). Due to the characteristic pathology of the angio-architecture in MMD, most previous studies,
either clinical or basic, focused on the vascular pathology of
MMD, and intensive basic research has been focusing on the role
of the RNF213 gene in angiogenesis and/or steno-occlusive
changes in intra-cranial arteries after the discovery of RNF213
as a susceptibility gene for MMD (Sonobe et al, 2014a,b; Ito et al.,
2015; Kobayashi et al., 2015; Kanoke et al, 2015). However, the

contribution of RNF213 gene polymorphisms to the pathophysiology of MMD has not yet been examined. We generated
mutant mice lacking the Rnf213 gene, and found that they grew
normally and did not demonstrated any changes mimicking
MMD as evaluated by high resolution magnetic resonance
angiography and histological analyses of vascular structures
(Sonobe et al., 2014). More recently, we also generated knock-in
mice having the R4859K mutation of Rnf213 gene, which also
grew normally and did not have characteristic ﬁndings of MMD
(Kanoke et al., 2015). Kobayashi and colleagues recently reported
that the overexpression of RNF213 R4810K, mimicking polymorphisms in patients with MMD, in endothelial cells resulted
in the suppression of angiogenesis, which is in contrast to the

pathology of MMD (Kobayashi et al, 2015). Furthermore, we did
not detect any modiﬁcations in angiogenic activity in Rnf213knockout mice after cerebral ischemia (Ito et al, 2015), which
indicated that RNF213 research exclusively focusing on vascular
structures has reached a dead-lock. Therefore, up-regulation of
the Rnf213 gene in mice subjected to cerebral ischemia and
reperfusion may provide new insights into the role of the RNF213
gene in MMD.
The exact mechanism by which Rnf213 gene up-regulation
participates in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia currently remains unknown. The present study showed that the
Rnf213 gene was up-regulated mainly in neurons as early as 6 h
after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, and its induction in glial

54

brain research 1630 (2016) 50–55

cells is contrarily limited. In light of our previous observation
that there was no difference of cerebral infarction volume after
tMCAO between Rnf213-deﬁcient mice and wild-type littermates
(Ito et al., 2015), it is unlikely that Rnf213 directly contributes to
the neuro-protection and/or neuronal cell death after acute focal
cerebral ischemia. Nevertheless, the co-localization of Rnf213positive neurons and TUNEL in the presents study strongly
suggests the involvement of Rnf213 gene in the survival and/or
death of neurons under ischemic conditions. Since the genotype
of RNF213 gene was reported to correlate signiﬁcantly to the
severity of clinical conditions such as the onset of cerebral
infarction and cognitive impairment (Miyatake et al., 2012; Kim
et al., 2015), we speculate that RNF213 gene not only participates
in vascular pathology but also plays some role in neuroprotection against chronic cerebral ischemia. It would be of great
interest to compare ischemic brain injury after chronic cerebral
ischemia between wild type mice and Rnf213-deﬁcient mice
(Sonobe et al., 2014a,b) or Rnf213 knock-in mice (Kanoke et al.,
2015) in the future study.
Our study has following limitation. The polymorphism of
RNF213 gene in patients MMD is a congenital pathology, while
the post-ischemic induction of Rnf213 gene is exclusively an
acquired phenomenon. Therefore, our results do not provide
direct implication in the basic pathology of MMD. Since patients
with MMD are subjected to chronic ischemic conditions for long
periods of time, it is conceivable that the RNF213 gene may
alternatively have some role in neuronal adaptation to these
chronic ischemic conditions.

Conclusion

The Rnf213 gene was up-regulated in the ischemic brain,
especially at the penumbra area, as early as 6 h after tMCAO.
Early increases in the expression of the Rnf213 gene after tMCAO
indicate its involvement in cerebral ischemia, which is an
underlying pathology of MMD. Further investigation is required
to clarify its exact role in the pathophysiology of MMD.

bifurcation. After removing the vascular clip and cutting the ECA,
the intraluminal suture was inserted into the ICA approximately
9 mm from the CCA bifurcation until mild resistance was felt.
The collar suture of the ECA stump was tightened securely
around the inserted ﬁlament. The wound was closed with 6-0
nylon sutures, and the intraluminal suture was hidden in the
wound. The mouse was placed in a prone position, ﬁxed in a
head holder (SG-4N, Narishige, Tokyo, Japan), and the scalp was
then shaved and cut with surgical scissors to expose the thin
skull over the bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. The
surface of the skull was covered with a slipcover over a thin layer
of saline to prevent drying. We recorded cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF)
values through the intact skull for 20 s using laser speckle
ﬂowmetry (OMEGAZONE, Omegawave, Tokyo, Japan) and conﬁrmed decreasing CBF values in the MCA and PCA territories.
The mouse was then allowed to regain consciousness. The
mouse was re-anesthetized, placed in a supine position, and
the intraluminal suture was gently and slowly withdrawn to
achieve reperfusion 60 min after the induction of ischemia. The
ECA was ligated with the collar suture. Treated mice were
awakened to allow for a given survival period: they were
randomly assigned to 5 groups deﬁned by times after reperfusion; 1-, 3-, 6-, 24-, and 72-h groups. At each time point,
anesthetized mice were perfused through the heart with saline,
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). In order to obtain frozen sections for in situ
hybridization, isolated brains were re-ﬁxed at 4 1C overnight in
4% PFA/Diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated PBS. All procedures
were approved by the animal care facility of Tohoku University
Graduate School of Medicine.

Experimental procedures

5.1.
Animal model of focal cerebral ischemia and
reperfusion
Male C57BL6/j mice (8 weeks old, 20–24 g) were subjected to
tMCAO by the intraluminal blockade of MCA as previously
described (Ito et al., 2015). Brieﬂy, animals were anesthetized
with 1.5% isoﬂurane in 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide and
breathed spontaneously. Rectal temperatures during all surgical
procedures were maintained at 3770.5 1C using a feedbackregulated heating pad (BWT- 100, Bio Research Center, Nagoya,
Japan). An anesthetized mouse was placed in a supine position
and incised at its neck at the midline. The left common carotid
artery (CCA), pterygopalatine artery, and external carotid artery
(ECA) were carefully dissected. The ICA and CCA were temporarily closed using a vascular clip (MH-1-20, BEAR Medic, Tokyo,
Japan), and a silicon-coated 6-0 nylon monoﬁlament
(602345PK5Re, Doccol, Redlands, CA, USA) was then introduced
into the arteriotomy hole in the ECA and advanced into the CCA

5.2.
In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical
analysis
We utilized the RIKEN FANTOM™ clone F830031A22 (GenBank
AK156571: distributed through K.K. DNAFORM, Yokohama
Japan) to prepare DNA templates for synthesizing digoxigenin
(DIG)-labeled mouse Rnf213 RNA-probes. A DIG-labeled antisense probe was transcribed from the template F830031A22
cDNA in a pFLCI vector [modiﬁed pBluescript KS(þ)] using T3
RNA polymerase, and the sense probe was transcribed with T7
RNA polymerase. Coronal frozen sections that were 12-mmthick were hybridized with Rnf213 probes following a standard
protocol. Brieﬂy, after re-ﬁxing with 4%PFA in DEPC-PBS,
sections were processed in the following steps: digested in
protease K 1 mg/ml solution, re-ﬁxed, acetylated, permeabilized, pre-hybridized, and hybridized. Signals were detected
with an alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-DIG antibody
(Roche diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim Germany), and color
development was performed in NBT/BCIP solution for 2–
3 days.
After the in situ hybridization process, some samples were
used for immunohistochemical analyses. In this case, the
digestion step in Protease K solution was skipped, and samples
were ﬁxed in 4% PFA/PBS after the ﬁnal step of in situ
hybridization. The following antibodies were used in this
study: 1:200 anti-NeuN (Clone A60, Millipore, Temecula USA),
1:200 anti-GFAP (#12389, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers USA), 1:200 biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame USA), 1:1000 goat anti-Rabbit IgG Alexa

brain research 1630 (2016) 50–55

Fluor 488 conjugate (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Rockford USA), and
1:200 Fluorescent Avidin DCS (Vector Laboratories). An in situ
cell death detection kit with POD (Roche diagnostics GmbH,
Mannheim Germany) was utilized forTUNEL detection.
Sections were observed and recorded with BZ-9000 (Keyence,
Osaka Japan). Whole brain images were captured at 2  or 4 
magniﬁcation and stitched together, while the ﬁlter function,
“Haze reduction” was applied to some images at higher
magniﬁcations.

5.3.

Real-time PCR analysis

Rnf213 mRNA was quantiﬁed using real-time PCR based on
the TaqMan gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Fifteen mice were given an overdose of
isoﬂurane and transcardially perfused with cold saline 1, 3, 6,
24 and 72 h after reperfusion. RNA was extracted from the
ischemic (left) hemisphere of isolated brains and sham
control brains using lysis buffer (ISOGEN, NIPPON GENE CO.,
LTD., Tokyo, Japan). Brieﬂy, homogenates were stored at
room temperature for 5 min, 0.2 ml chloroform was then
added, shaken vigorously for 15 s, and stored at room temperature for 3 min. The samples were then centrifuged at
12,000g at 4 1C for 15 min. The aqueous phase was recovered
and incubated with 0.5 ml isopropanol at room temperature
for 10 min. After being incubated, samples were centrifuged
at 12,000g at 4 1C for 10 min. The pellets were brieﬂy dried,
ddH2O was added, and total RNA was then obtained. Total
RNA was reverse transcribed (High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA™
Kit, Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All ampliﬁcation
reactions were performed on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). The forward primers used in
the PCR ampliﬁcation reaction were as follows (from 50 to 30 ).
GGTGCAGAGCCACGGGGTGTTAAAT for mouse Rnf213; ACTGAGCTGCGTTTTACACCCTTTC for the mouse beta-actin gene.
Expression of the target gene Rnf213 was normalized with the
housekeeping gene beta-actin and was displayed as 2  ΔCT□/.
