nflammation is a key component in the pathophysiology of
ischemic stroke (1), a leading cause of death and disability with limited treatment options (2, 3). Numerous experimental approaches have explored the therapeutic potential of
modulating postischemic inflammation (4). Despite promising attempts, such strategies have not been successful in clinical trials (5).
One reason for this failure might be the poor understanding of the
cellular mechanisms of the injury attributable to postischemic
inflammation (6). For instance, the respective contributions to the
damage of resident brain cells (microglia and endothelial cells)
and peripheral blood-borne cells infiltrating the postischemic brain
(leukocytes), which can express the same inflammatory mediators,
has not been established (6).
Inducible NO synthase (iNOS or NOS2) is a key player in the
postischemic inflammatory cascade (7, 8), and NO produced by de
novo expression of iNOS (9) contributes to cerebral ischemic injury (10, 11). In rodents, iNOS is expressed from 12 h to several
days after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) (12–14).

munoreactivity is present in inflammatory cells and blood vessels
in the brain (10, 15–17). iNOS is an attractive therapeutic target
because its inhibition has an extended therapeutic window, induces long-lasting protection, and is observed both with permanent
and transient ischemia as well as in animals with stroke risk
factors (10, 15, 18). However, it remains to be established whether
the cells expressing iNOS and causing the damage are intrinsic or
extrinsic to the brain and whether the reduction in injury afforded
by iNOS inhibition results from preventing the brain infiltration of
blood-borne inflammatory cells. These issues have translational
relevance because focusing treatments to the specific iNOSexpressing cells involved in the damage would minimize adverse effects associated with systemic iNOS inhibition such as
immunosuppression.
Therefore, a major goal of this study was to determine whether
the iNOS-expressing cells that contribute to ischemic injury are
intrinsic to the brain or blood derived. We used iNOS bone marrow
(BM) chimeras and adoptive transfer-based approaches to investigate the cellular source(s) of iNOS expression and their pathogenic relevance. We found that iNOS both in infiltrating neutrophils
and cerebral endothelial cells contributes to ischemic brain injury
and that there is a previously unrecognized reciprocal interaction
between iNOS expression in endothelial cells and blood leukocytes
that has an impact on the damage. These data provide new insight
into the cellular bases of the deleterious effects of postischemic
iNOS expression and suggest that harnessing the therapeutic potential of iNOS inhibition would require targeting iNOS both in
endothelial cells and neutrophils.

NO produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) contributes to ischemic brain injury, but the cell types expressing iNOS and mediating tissue damage have not been elucidated. To examine the relative contribution of iNOS in resident brain cells and peripheral
leukocytes infiltrating the ischemic brain, we used bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice in which the middle cerebral artery was
occluded and infarct volume was determined 3 d later. iNOS2/2 mice engrafted with iNOS+/+ BM exhibited larger infarcts
(44 6 2 mm3; n = 13; mean 6 SE) compared with autologous transplanted iNOS2/2 mice (24 6 3 mm3; n = 10; p < 0.01), implicating blood-borne leukocytes in the damage. Furthermore, iNOS+/+ mice transplanted with iNOS2/2 BM had large infarcts (39 6 6 mm3;
n = 13), similar to those of autologous transplanted iNOS+/+ mice (39 6 4 mm3; n = 14), indicating the resident brain cells also
play a role. Flow cytometry and cell sorting revealed that iNOS is highly expressed in neutrophils and endothelium but not
microglia. Surprisingly, postischemic iNOS expression was enhanced in the endothelium of iNOS+/+ mice transplanted with
iNOS2/2 BM and in leukocytes of iNOS2/2 mice with iNOS+/+ BM, suggesting that endothelial iNOS suppresses iNOS expression
in leukocytes and vice versa. To provide independent evidence that neutrophils mediate brain injury, neutrophils were isolated and
transferred to mice 24 h after stroke. Consistent with the result in chimeric mice, transfer of iNOS+/+, but not iNOS2/2,
neutrophils into iNOS2/2 mice increased infarct volume. The findings establish that iNOS in both neutrophils and endothelium
mediates tissue damage and identify these cell types as putative therapeutic targets for stroke injury. The Journal of Immunology, 2014, 193: 2531–2537.

in 7- to 8-wk-old male iNOS2/2 mice on a C57BL/6J background originally developed by MacMicking et al. (19) and obtained from an in-house
colony (20). Age-matched wild-type mice (C57BL/6J; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) served as controls.

MCAo

Measurement of infarct volume
As described in detail elsewhere (21), infarct volume, corrected for
swelling, was quantified 3 d after ischemia using cresyl violet staining on
30-mm-thick coronal brain sections and image analysis software (MCID;
Imaging Research).

BM transplantation
Whole-body irradiation was performed on 7-wk-old male mice (iNOS+/+
and iNOS2/2) with a lethal dose of 9.5 Gy of g radiation using a 137Cs
source (Nordion Gammacell 40 Exactor; Theratronics, Ottawa, ON,
Canada). Eighteen hours later, irradiated mice were transplanted with BM
cells (2 3 106, i.v.) isolated from donor iNOS+/+ or iNOS2/2 mice.
Therefore, four groups of chimeric mice were obtained: irradiated iNOS+/+
with iNOS+/+ BM transplant (iNOS+/+BM+/+); irradiated iNOS2/2 with
iNOS2/2 BM transplant (iNOS2/2BM2/2); irradiated iNOS2/2 with iNOS+/+
BM transplant (iNOS2/2BM+/+); and irradiated iNOS+/+ with iNOS2/2 BM
transplant (iNOS+/+BM2/2). Donor BM cells were flushed out with 2–3 ml
PBS from the femur and tibias, filtered through a 40-mm nylon mesh, and
counted for viability before injection. Transplanted mice were housed in
cages with sulfamethoxazole (0.12%; w/v) and trimethoprim (0.024%)
antibiotics added to the drinking water for the first 2 wk. Reconstitution of
BM cells was verified 5 wk after irradiation by testing the percentage of
positive iNOS genomic DNA in isolated blood leukocytes. To this end, 300
ml blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture from mice under deep anesthesia immediately before sacrifice. Erythrolysis was performed three
times using 5 ml erythrocyte lysis buffer (ELB; 0.15 M NH4Cl, 1 mM
KHCO3, and 0.1 mM Na-EDTA; 5 min, room temperature). Afterward,
DNA was purified from leukocytes using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit
(69504; Qiagen, Germantown, MD), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Reference primers sequences were m_ICAM1_prom.3 59GGACTCACCTGCTGGTCTCT-39 and m_ICAM1_prom.4 59-GAACGAGGGCTTCGGTATTT-39; and target primers sequences were NOS2_gt_1
59-GAGACAGATGGCTCAGGAGTG-39 and NOS2_gt_2 59-TAGGGACCGGGTAAAGAGAAA-39, all purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies
(Grand Island, NY). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted with
20 ng DNA in duplicate 15-ml reactions using the Maxima SYBR Green/
ROX qPCR Master Mix (23) (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The
reactions were incubated at 50˚C for 2 min and then at 95˚C for 10 min. A
PCR cycling protocol consisting of 15 s at 95˚C and 1 min at 60˚C for 45
cycles was used for quantification. iNOS relative expression levels were
calculated by 2(2DDC(T)) method (22).

Brain cell isolation
Mice were transcardially perfused under deep anesthesia with 30 ml
heparinized saline to exclude blood cells. The ischemic hemisphere was
separated from the cerebellum and olfactory bulb and gently triturated
in HEPES–HBSS buffer (138 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.4 mM Na2HPO4,
0.4 mM KH2PO4, 5 mM D-glucose, and 10 mM HEPES) using Gentle
MACS dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The suspension was digested with 62.5 mg/ml
Liberase DH (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and 50 U/ml

DNAse I at 37˚C for 45 min in an orbital shaker at 160 rpm. Cells were
washed and subjected to discontinuous 70/25% Percoll (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ) density gradient centrifugation (25 min, 800 3 g, 4˚C).
Enriched mononuclear cells were collected from the interphase, washed
with HEPES–HBSS buffer, and resuspended in 2% FBS in PBS for
staining and FACS analysis.

FACS analysis and cell sorting
Rat mAbs used for FACS analysis include: CD45-allophycocyanin (clone
30F-11), CD11b-PE (clone M1/70), Gr1-PerCP-Cy5.5 (clone RB6-865),
Ly6C-FITC (clone HK1.4), CD54-FITC (ICAM-1, clone AF647) and
CD106-PE (VCAM-1, clone 429/MVCAM.A) from BioLegend (San
Diego, CA). Isolated brain cells were stained at 4˚C with predetermined
optimal concentrations of Abs for 20 min and analyzed on an Accuri C6
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Dead cells and debris
were gated out by forward light scatter and side scatter properties. Cell
populations were separated based on CD45 and Ly6C expression and
further sorted by CD11b and Gr1 expression. Infiltrating leukocytes were
identified as CD45hi and further gated by CD11b and Gr1 markers. Neutrophils were identified as CD45hi/CD11bhi/Gr1hi. CD45hi/CD11bhi/Gr1lo
sorting identifies monocytes/macrophages. Nonmyeloid leukocytes were
considered as CD45hi/CD11blo/Gr1lo cells. Microglia were identified by
intermediate CD45 expression as CD45int/CD11bhi/Ly6Clo. Endothelial
cells were identified as CD45lo /Ly6Chi (23) and expression of CD54
(ICAM-1) and CD106 (VCAM-1) adhesion molecules on EC surface was
also analyzed. Appropriate isotype control Abs, ‘fluorescence minus one’
staining and staining of negative populations were use to establish sorting
parameters. Absolute cell numbers and frequencies were recorded. Additionally, in other experiments, the cell fractions of neutrophils, monocytes/
macrophages, microglia and endothelial cells, identified using the same
gating strategy as detailed above, were sorted on a FACSVantage cytometer (BD Biosciences) for mRNA analysis.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Cell fractions were collected in TRIzol LS (Invitrogen Life Technologies)
and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA
samples were treated with Rnase free DnaseI (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) to
remove DNA contamination. cDNA was produced from mRNA samples by
using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific).
Quantitative determination of gene expression for endothelial-leukocyte
adhesion molecule 1 (Elam-1), Ly6G, and iNOS genes were performed
on a Chromo 4 Detector (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using a two-step cycling
protocol. Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) was
used to normalize gene expression. Primer sequences, purchased from
Invitrogen Life Technologies, were as follows: HPRT, 59-AGTGTTGGATACAGGCCAGAC-39 and 59-CGTGATTCAAATCCCTGAAGT-39;
Elam-1, 59-CTCACTCCTGACATCGTCCTC-39 and 59-ACGTTGTAAGAAGGCACATGG-39; Ly6G, 59-CCTGAGACTTCCTGCAACACA-39
and 59-TGCTTCTGTGAGAGTCCACAAT-39; and iNOS, 59-TCACCACAAGGCCACATCGGATT-39 and 59-AGCTCCTCCAGAGGGGTAGGCT39. qRT-PCR was conducted with cDNA in duplicate 15-ml reactions using
the Maxima SYBR Green/ROX qPCR Master Mix (23) (Thermo Scientific).
The reactions were incubated at 50˚C for 2 min and then at 95˚C for 10 min.
A PCR cycling protocol consisting of 15 s at 95˚C and 1 min at 60˚C for 45
cycles was used for quantification. Elam-1 and Ly6G relative expression
levels were calculated by 2(2DDC(T)) method (22). The number of both HPRT
and iNOS gene copies in cell fractions was calculated from their respective
cycle threshold, using an equation derived from a HPRT–cDNA or iNOS–
cDNA plasmid standard curve, respectively, amplified in parallel. Data were
expressed as iNOS mRNA copies relative to HPRT mRNA copies for each
cell fraction.

Western blot
C57BL6 wild-type mice (n = 12) were subjected to transient MCAo and
3 d later, their brains where processed for flowmetric cell sorting of
neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, microglia, and endothelial cells, as
described above. The cell fractions were pooled (n = 12 mice/cell
fraction) and resolved on a 7% SDS-PAGE gel. Separated proteins
were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and iNOS
was immunodetected using a polyclonal-rabbit anti-iNOS Ab (1/100;
number 15323; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Immunoreactive bands were
visualized using SuperSignal West Femto reagent (Thermo Scientific) on
a chemiluminescent imager (LI-COR C-DiGit Blot Scanner; LI-COR,
Lincoln, NE). Lysates from Raw264.7 cells stimulated with LPS (10
ng/ml) and IFN-g (100 U/ml) were used as a positive control of iNOS
protein expression.

Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced using the intraluminal filament model of MCAo, as described previously (21). Under isoflurane
anesthesia (maintenance 1.5–2%), a heat-blunted nylon suture (6/0) was
inserted into the right external carotid artery of anesthetized mice and
advanced until it obstructed the MCA. This was confirmed by cerebral
blood flow (CBF) measured using transcranial laser Doppler flowmetry
(Periflux System 5010; Perimed, King Park, NY) in the territory irrigated
by the right MCA (2 mm posterior, 5 mm lateral to bregma). The filament
was left in place for 35 min (naive mice) or 30 min (chimeric mice) and
then withdrawn. Ischemia time was reduced in chimeric mice because in
a pilot study we found high mortality of iNOS2/2 mice transplanted with
iNOS+/+ BM subjected to 35 min MCAo (iNOS2/2BM2/2, all survived
[n = 6]; iNOS2/2BM+/+, only four of eight mice survived, x2 p , 0.05).
Only animals that exhibited a reduction in CBF of .85% during MCA occlusion and in which CBF recovered by .80% after 10 min of reperfusion were
included in the study (21). Rectal temperature was monitored and kept
constant (37.0 6 0.5˚C) during the surgical procedure and in the recovery
period until the animals regained full consciousness.

Adoptive cell transfer

Data analysis
Data are expressed as mean 6 SE. Statistical differences in mortality were
assayed by the Fisher’s exact test and x2 test. Intergroup differences in
infarct volume, flow analysis, and mRNA expression were analyzed using
a Student unpaired t test or one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s posthoc
analysis, as appropriate. Differences were considered statistically significant for p , 0.05.

Results
Mice groups and mortality
A total of 229 mice were used in this study. Of these, 52 naive mice
were used for determination of infarct volume or FACS analysis
of brain cells after MCAo. For adoptive transfer experiments,
25 mice were used as neutrophil donors and 40 mice were used
as recipients, which were subjected to MCAo for infarct volume
measurement. Six iNOS2/2 mice were excluded due to inadequate
ischemia–reperfusion. Three mice (one iNOS+/+ mouse and two
iNOS2/2 mice) died before 72 h and no differences were found
between groups (Fisher’s test, p = 1). To generate chimeric animals, 10 mice were used as BM donors to obtain 102 chimeric
mice, which were subjected to MCAo and used for infarct volume
determination or FACS sorting. Four chimeric mice were excluded
from the study because of inadequate ischemia–reperfusion (one
iNOS+/+BM+/+ mouse, two iNOS2/2BM+/+ mice, and one iNOS2/2
BM2/2 mouse). Four chimeric mice (two iNOS2/2BM+/+ mice
and two iNOS+/+BM2/2 mice) died before 72 h. No differences
were found in mortality rate among groups (x2, p = 0.4).
The protective effect of iNOS deletion is not due to reduced
postischemic leukocyte infiltration
First, we sought to confirm that iNOS deficiency results in less
severe ischemic injury after MCAo, as previously reported (11).
iNOS2/2 mice had smaller infarcts than iNOS+/+ mice 72 h after
MCAo (Fig. 1A), a finding not because of differences in intraischemic CBF, which was similar in both groups (Fig. 1B). Because iNOS may influence the migration of inflammatory cells
(24), we next examined whether the protection observed in
iNOS2/2 mice was the result of reduced leukocyte infiltration. To
this end, we performed FACS analysis of brain cells in iNOS+/+
and iNOS2/2 mice 48 h after MCAo (Fig. 2), the earliest time
point of leukocyte infiltration after ischemia/reperfusion (Fig. 2B).
FACS analysis showed no differences in the total number of infiltrating leukocytes (CD45hi cells) between iNOS+/+ and iNOS2/2
mice, or in monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils (Fig. 2C).
Similarly, no differences in the number of microglia and endothelial cells were observed between iNOS+/+ and iNOS2/2 mice.

FIGURE 1. Ischemic injury is attenuated in iNOS2/2 mice. (A) iNOS2/2
mice have smaller infarcts than iNOS+/+ 72 h after MCAo; values are
mean 6 SE, n = 13–16/group. **p , 0.01. (B) CBF changes during
ischemia and reperfusion were similar in both groups (mean 6 SE, n =
13–16/group).

Furthermore, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in brain endothelial
cells, which mediates postischemic neutrophil and monocyte/
lymphocyte endothelial adhesion (25, 26), was similar in both
groups 48 h after MCAo (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the protection afforded by iNOS deficiency is not secondary to reduced leukocyte
infiltration after stroke.
iNOS expression in blood-borne leukocytes and resident brain
cells contributes to brain injury after MCAo
To investigate the relative contribution to ischemic injury of
iNOS in resident brain cells or BM-derived cells, we studied iNOS
chimeric mice. Successful induction of chimerism in BMtransplanted mice was verified by genomic analysis for the presence of the intact iNOS (NOS2) gene in peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 3A). Chimeric mice were subjected to MCAo and
infarct volume was determined 72 h later (Fig. 3B). The infarct
volume in iNOS2/2 mice transplanted with iNOS2/2 BM
(iNOS2/2BM2/2) was smaller than that of iNOS+/+ mice transplanted with iNOS+/+ BM (iNOS+/+BM+/+), indicating that irradiation and BM transplant did not influence the neuroprotection
associated with the iNOS2/2 genotype. However, in iNOS2/2
BM+/+ chimeric mice, in which iNOS is present in peripheral
leukocytes but not in resident brain cells, infarcts were larger than
in iNOS2/2BM2/2 (p , 0.01) and not different from those of
iNOS+/+BM+/+ mice (p . 0.05) (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, in iNOS+/+
mice transplanted with iNOS2/2 BM (iNOS+/+BM2/2) the
infarcts were not different from those of iNOS+/+BM+/+ mice
(Fig. 3B), implicating also iNOS in resident brain cells in the
damage. CBF changes during ischemia-reperfusion did not differ
among groups (Fig. 3C), although a trend for increased hyperemia
during early reperfusion was seen in iNOS+/+BM2/2 mice. These
data suggest that iNOS in BM-derived cells contributes to brain
injury after MCAo, but that iNOS in resident brain cells may also
play a role.
iNOS is expressed in infiltrating leukocytes and in endothelial
cells, but not in microglia, after MCAo
The data presented above indicate that iNOS both in BM-derived
and resident brain cells contribute to ischemic brain injury. We next
sought to determine the cell types expressing iNOS after MCAo,
which may be involved in the damage. Microglia and endothelial
cells, resident brain cells with the greatest potential for iNOS
expression (15, 27, 28), and infiltrating leukocytes (monocytes/
macrophages and neutrophils) were isolated by FACS sorting
from chimeric mice 72 h after MCAo, when postischemic iNOS
expression is highest (29). Cell fractions were processed for qRTPCR and iNOS mRNA expression was analyzed in each pop-

Neutrophils were purified from BM of iNOS+/+ or iNOS2/2 mice by
immunomagnetic negative enrichment. Whole BM was flushed out from
femurs and tibias using a 26-gauge needle attached to a 10 ml PBS-filled
syringe, and cells were dispersed by slow aspiration through a 20-gauge
needle. After centrifugation (300 3 g, 10 min, room temperature), the
supernatant was removed by aspiration, and erythrolysis was performed
using 5 ml ELB for 1 min, room temperature). Subsequently, 15 ml PBS
was added, and the suspension was passed through a 40-mm cell strainer
(catalog number 352340; BD Falcon). The strainer was then washed with
10 ml PBS. BM cells were centrifuged (300 3 g, 10 min, room temperature) and resuspended in MACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% FBS
and 2 mM EDTA; 100 ml/10 7 cells). An appropriate volume of
biotinylated-Ab mixture (see Table I) and cells were purified with anti–
biotin-microbeads, according to the manufacturer’s suggestions (Miltenyi
Biotec). Diluted and centrifuged cell preparations contained .90% neutrophils as determined by flow cytometry (anti–Ly6G-PerCP-Cy5.5, 1A8
clone; BioLegend). Afterward, cells were washed, resuspended in sterile
physiological saline (5 3 105 cell/100 ml), and administered by injection
into the right retro-orbital sinus in anesthetized mice 24 h after MCAo (100
ml/mouse). Control animals received 100 ml saline.

NEUTROPHIL iNOS AND ISCHEMIC BRAIN INJURY

Adoptive transfer of iNOS+/+ neutrophils worsens ischemic
injury in iNOS2/2 mice
The data presented above indicate that iNOS is highly expressed in
neutrophils infiltrating the ischemic brain. To determine whether
iNOS in neutrophils contributes to tissue damage, we adoptively
transferred iNOS+/+ or iNOS2/2 neutrophils (5 3 105 cells, i.v.;
Table I) into recipient mice 24 h after MCAo (Fig. 5). iNOS2/2
mice receiving iNOS2/2 neutrophils had smaller infarcts than
iNOS+/+ mice receiving iNOS+/+ neutrophils. However, infarct
volumes were larger in iNOS2/2 mice receiving iNOS+/+ neutrophils and not statistically different from those of iNOS+/+ mice
receiving iNOS+/+ neutrophils (p . 0.05).

Discussion

FIGURE 2. Brain leukocyte infiltration after MCAo is similar in both
iNOS+/+ and iNOS2/2 mice. (A) Gating strategy and flow cytometric
analysis of isolated brain cells stained for CD45, Ly6C, CD11b, and
Gr1 cell surface markers. Four different populations were identified:
CD45hi/CD11bhi/Gr1lo (monocytes), CD45hi/CD11bhi/Gr1hi (neutrophils),
CD45int/CD11bhi/Gr1lo/Ly6Clo (microglia), and CD45lo/CD11blo/Gr1lo/Ly6Chi
(endothelial cells, EC). (B) Time course of infiltrating leukocytes in the
ischemic brain of iNOS+/+ mice showed an increase of both monocytes
and neutrophils as early as 48 h after MCAo. Values are mean 6 SE, n =
5–7/group. **p , 0.01 versus naive (N) and sham (S) groups. (C) Total

This study provides several new findings. First, we demonstrated
that the protection from ischemic injury observed in iNOS2/2 mice
is not due to reduced infiltration of blood-borne inflammatory
cells, assessed quantitatively by FACS analysis. Second, using
chimeric mice, we found that both resident brain cells (endothelial
cells) and infiltrating leukocytes expressing iNOS contribute to
postischemic brain injury. Third, we demonstrated that adoptive
transfer of iNOS+/+ neutrophils is sufficient to offset in large part
the protection in iNOS2/2 mice, highlighting the pathogenic role
of neutrophil iNOS in ischemic brain injury. Fourth, we found that
suppression of iNOS expression in leukocytes enhances iNOS
expression in endothelial cells and vice versa, unveiling a previously unappreciated reciprocal interaction regulating postischemic
iNOS expression. These observations collectively provide new
insight into the cellular expression of iNOS after ischemic stroke
and its role in the ensuing brain damage.
iNOS is upregulated at the transcriptional level by the activity
of NF-kB and Stat1a transcription factors among others (30).
Accordingly, iNOS levels are normally very low, but after ischemia, iNOS transcription is induced resulting in the generation of
large amounts of NO (31). Reacting with superoxide (O22), a free
radical generated in the brain after ischemia/reperfusion (32), NO
gives rise to the powerful oxidant peroxynitrite resulting in significant nitrosative damage of biological molecules, which, in

infiltrating leukocytes (CD45hi), monocytes, and neutrophils showed
similar levels in either iNOS+/+ or iNOS2/2 48 h after MCAo. No changes
were also detected in the number of microglia or EC cells. In addition, the
percentage of EC expressing ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was similar in both
groups. Values are mean 6 SE, n = 6/group. ***p , 0.001, *p , 0.5

ulation (Fig. 4A). The purity of the sorted populations was evaluated by the expression of Elam-1 in EC and of Ly6G in neutrophils (Fig. 4B). In wild-type BM-transplanted mice, iNOS
mRNA was induced in neutrophils, monocytes and endothelial
cells, whereas iNOS expression was not observed in microglia. In
iNOS2/2 mice transplanted with iNOS+/+ BM, iNOS expression
was enhanced in neutrophils and monocytes compared with
iNOS+/+BM+/+ mice, but it was not detected in EC or microglia
(Fig. 4A). Conversely, iNOS+/+ mice transplanted with iNOS2/2
BM exhibited a significantly higher iNOS upregulation in EC
compared with controls, whereas iNOS expression was not
detected in microglia or infiltrating leukocytes (Fig. 4A). In addition, cell fractions isolated from wild type mice 72 h after
MCAo were analyzed for iNOS expression at the protein level by
western blotting (Fig. 4C). In agreement with mRNA data, iNOS
protein expression was observed in monocytes/macrophages,
neutrophils, and endothelial cells but not in microglia.

BM+/+ mice, iNOS mRNA was detected in all cell populations, except for
microglia (data not shown). In iNOS2/2 mice transplanted with wild-type

and monocytes, whereas iNOS mRNA was detected in EC from iNOS+/+
mice transplanted with iNOS2/2 BM (iNOS+/+BM2/2). Values are mean 6

enhances endothelial leukocyte adhesion, in hepatic ischemic/
reperfusion injury, iNOS-derived NO facilitates leukocyte transmigration (24). Therefore, we first investigated whether the neuroprotection afforded by iNOS deficiency was due to reduced
leukocyte trafficking into the injured brain. However, we did not
find differences in the number of infiltrating leukocytes or changes
in the level of discrete leukocyte populations involved in postischemic inflammation, such as neutrophils and monocytes (38).
Furthermore, iNOS deletion did not affect the expression of endothelial ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, adhesion molecules involved in
the postischemic transmigration of leukocytes across the blood–
brain barrier (25, 26). Accordingly, our findings indicate that the
deleterious effect of iNOS is not secondary to enhancement of
leukocyte infiltration into the ischemic brain but to a direct action
iNOS-expressing cells on the ischemic tissue.
iNOS immunoreactivity has been observed in microvessels and
neutrophils after experimental stroke (12, 15, 16) and postmortem
in stroke patients (17), but the pathogenic significance of iNOS
in these cells was not established. To our knowledge, the present
study is the first to provide evidence in support of a cell-specific
pathogenic effect of endothelial and neutrophil iNOS on the
postischemic brain. We found that both brain infiltrating neutrophils and monocytes express iNOS and reconstitution of an
iNOS2/2 host with iNOS+/+ BM was sufficient to counteract the
protection and restore the injury to levels observed in wild-type
mice. These findings, collectively, demonstrate that BM-derived
cells, specifically neutrophils, represent a major source of the
iNOS responsible for brain damage. Polymorphonuclear cells
have long been implicated in the brain damage induced by postischemic inflammation through a wide variety of mechanisms (39–
42). Our data suggest that iNOS-derived NO, which promotes
lipid peroxidation, protein nitration, DNA damage, and blood–
brain barrier breakdown (43), is a major neurotoxic molecule
produced by neutrophils (44, 45). To provide further evidence that
expression of iNOS in infiltrating leukocytes exacerbates ischemic
injury, we adoptively transferred neutrophils into iNOS2/2 mice.
We chose to transfer neutrophils because they express higher
levels of iNOS than monocytes. Doing so was sufficient to increase the infarct volume to similar levels observed in iNOS+/+
mice, confirming that neutrophil iNOS is a key player in ischemic
brain damage. Our data show that neither transfer of iNOS2/2
neutrophils into iNOS2/2 mice, nor transfer of iNOS+/+ neutrophils into iNOS+/+ mice affected the infarct volume when
compared with control iNOS2/2 and iNOS+/+ mice, respectively.
These findings indicate that the increased brain damage in iNOS2/2
mice following iNOS+/+ neutrophil transfer is most likely mediated

turn, contributes to ischemic injury (33). However, another aspect
of iNOS-derived NO function is its ability to regulate leukocyte
recruitment to inflammatory sites (34). Although it is well established that inhibition (35, 36) or genomic deletion (37) of iNOS

FIGURE 5. Adoptive transfer of iNOS+/+ neutrophils worsens ischemic
injury in iNOS2/2 mice. Adoptive transfer of iNOS+/+ (5 3 105 cells) but

iNOS induction by inhibiting NF-kB activity (56–58), providing
a potential mechanisms for this effect. This finding has therapeutic
implications in that it suggests that suppression of iNOS expression or activity in blood-borne leukocytes is not sufficient to
confer protection from ischemic injury and that cerebral endothelial cells have to be targeted at the same time.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the harmful effects of
iNOS in the ischemic brain are not mediated by enhancing the
accumulation of inflammatory cells in the injured brain. Rather,
iNOS in neutrophils infiltrating the ischemic brain and endothelial
cells is required for the expression of its destructive effects. We also
found that iNOS deletion only in leukocytes or endothelial cells is
not sufficient to confer protection because lack of iNOS in one cell
type enhances iNOS expression in the other. These findings provide
further insight into the cellular bases through which iNOS exerts its
deleterious effects on the brain and suggest specific cellular targets
for therapeutic approaches harnessing the protective potential of
iNOS inhibition.

by direct effects of iNOS-derived NO, rather than by an increase in
the number of circulating neutrophils after adoptive transfer or
microvascular clogging (46). Moreover, the number of transferred
neutrophils (5 3 105 cells) is well below the total number of circulating neutrophils in C57BL/6 mice (1 3 106 cells) and can thus
be considered to be within physiological limits (47).
We did not observe iNOS expression in microglia. iNOS expression can be induced in cultured microglia in the presence of
LPS or inflammatory cytokines (48, 49) and in vivo after cerebral
ischemia (50). However, iNOS expression in vivo has usually been
attributed to microglia on the basis of immunohistochemical
markers that cannot differentiate microglia from infiltrating
macrophages (51). In contrast, FACS analysis, as used in this
study, allows us to more clearly differentiate microglia from
monocytes/macrophages based on quantitative assessment of their
CD45 expression level (52). Using this approach, we were able to
document iNOS expression in monocytes/macrophages but not in
microglia. However, this observation does not exclude that possibility that microglial cells play a role in ischemic injury by
producing other mediators (1, 53, 54). iNOS immunoreactivity has
also been reported in astrocytes after ischemia in the postischemic
period, but the role of astrocytic iNOS in the acute phase of the
damage remains unclear because the expression occurs in the late
postischemic period (3 d after ischemia) (16, 55).
Unexpectedly, we observed that iNOS+/+ mice transplanted with
iNOS2/2 BM developed large infarcts despite of iNOS deficiency
in infiltrating leukocytes. This effect was correlated with increased
cerebral endothelial iNOS expression in the host, thus compensating for the lack of NO generation by infiltrating leukocytes.
Therefore, it is conceivable that NO-generating leukocytes may
limit endothelial iNOS expression after brain ischemia. Although
the reasons for the increased endothelial iNOS expression in mice
lacking leukocyte iNOS remain unclear, there is evidence for
a negative feedback loop by which iNOS-derived NO suppresses
