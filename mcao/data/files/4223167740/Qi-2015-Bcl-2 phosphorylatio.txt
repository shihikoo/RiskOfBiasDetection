Abstract Autophagy, an important intracellular degradation
pathway, has been reported to clear impaired mitochondria
and reduce mitochondria-mediated injury in ischemic disease.
Our study and other recent investigations have shown that
AKT-dependent autophagy contributes to the neuroprotection
afforded by limb remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in experimental stroke. However, how AKT triggers RIC-based
autophagy and whether RIC-afforded autophagy is beneficial
for mitochondrial function after cerebral ischemia remains
unclear. The disruption of the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex has been
reported to trigger autophagy formation in the condition of
Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser70. We investigated whether
Bcl-2 phosphorylation triggers RIC-based autophagy and
thereby confers RIC-induced neuroprotection against mitochondrial injury, using a transient cerebral ischemic rat model.
We demonstrated that rats undergoing RIC treatment 30 min
after the onset of ischemia (I-30) and at reperfusion (R-0)
significantly upregulated Bcl-2 phosphorylation.
Immunoprecipitation revealed that RIC increased dissociation

of the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex, leading to a higher level of
autophagy than in ischemia/reperfusion rats. Furthermore,
AKT activation was shown to play a critical role in regulating
Bcl-2-mediated autophagy, as an AKT inhibitor (LY294002,
AKTi) administered 30 min prior to ischemia significantly
suppressed Bcl-2 phosphorylation and Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex
dissociation, thereby reducing autophagy in RIC rats.
Blocking Bcl-2 phosphorylation-dependent autophagy with
AKTi suppressed RIC-afforded protection on mitochondrial
potential and mitochondrial-dependent cell death effector
pathway. These findings indicate that Bcl-2 phosphorylation
and thereby Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex disruption play a crucial
role in triggering autophagy and reducing mitochondrial damage in RIC rats after cerebral ischemia and require the involvement of the AKT activation.

Introduction
Limb remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), an easily applied
procedure that involves repeated occlusion and release cycles
of the bilateral femoral arteries, is regarded as adaptable for
intervention for stroke victims [1–3]. A number of studies
have been shown that RIC during ischemia or post reperfusion
plays a protective role in animal models of stroke [4–7].
Furthermore, a recent clinical study showed that prehospital
RIC therapy after stroke confers protective effects on reducing
the risk of tissue infarction, based on voxelwise analysis for
baseline perfusion and diffusion lesion severity [8]. These
studies provide initial evidence that RIC may be an important
approach for treating stroke patients.

It has recently been reported that RIC showed neuroprotection after embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion via activating AKT in the ischemic hemisphere [4]. Our previous study
also indicated that the AKT-dependent autophagy pathway
contributed to the neuroprotection afforded by RIC postreperfusion in experimental stroke [6]. However, it is still
unclear how AKT triggers or regulates autophagy in RIC
treatment.
Autophagy is a vital intracellular degradation pathway of
macromolecules or damaged organelles for subsequent reuse,
which helps to maintain intracellular homeostasis during starvation, malignancy, and neurodegeneration [9–13]. The phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at Ser70 has recently been reported to
trigger the disruption of the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex (a molecular switch for autophagy), which results in Beclin1 release
and autophagosome formation [14]. Moreover, it has been
reported that autophagy may reduce oxidative damage and
mitochondrial injury in ischemic disease [15–17]. We hypothesize that Bcl-2 phosphorylation activated by AKT plays a
crucial role in triggering autophagy and thus reduces mitochondrial damage in RIC rats after cerebral ischemia. In the
present study, we investigated whether RIC dissociates the
Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex via AKT/Bcl-2 phosphorylation, in a
rat model of transient cerebral ischemia.

release, as described in our previous study [6]. All rats were
subjected to 2 h of MCAO followed by 22 h of reperfusion
(I/R). According to the start of RIC, 60 rats were randomly
divided into three groups (20 animals per group): RIC at
30 min of ischemia (I-30), RIC at the onset of reperfusion
(R-0), and control group without RIC treatment (I/R). Among
them, eight animals per group (24 rats in total) would be
pretreated with an AKT inhibitor or DMSO (see BInhibition of
the AKT Pathway^ below).

Methods

Brain Tissue Collection and Infarction Measurement

MCAO Model

Brain tissue was collected 22 h after reperfusion for the
following assays. Rats were euthanized by cardiac perfusion with PBS. The brain was removed and sectioned into
four 2 mm thick coronal slices, from an 8 mm thick region 3 mm away from the tip of the frontal lobe. The
slices were stained with 1.5 % 5-triphenyl-2Htetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma) for infarction measurement, as described in our previous study [6].

All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Capital Medical
University, Beijing, and were carried out in accordance with
the principles outlined in the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (300–320 g) were anesthetized
with 1.75 % isoflurane in 70 % nitrous oxide and 30 % oxygen. For the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model,
ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) was established as described
previously [6]. MCA occlusion was conducted by a nylon
suture with a diameter of 0.38 mm and maintained in position
for 2 h. Successful MCAO was confirmed by laser Doppler
flowmetry (PeriFlux System 5000, Perimed, Stockholm,
Sweden). Animals that exhibited convulsions or sustained
consciousness disturbances were excluded from subsequent
experiments, as most of them were identified to have sustained
a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to suture-induced rupture of
the internal carotid artery.
RIC Treatment and Experimental Design
After MCAO onset, RIC was performed by bilateral clamping
of the femoral artery in three cycles of 10-min occlusion/10-min

Inhibition of the AKT Pathway
LY294002, an AKT inhibitor (AKTi), was used to pretreat
animals prior to ischemia to block the AKT pathway.
Twenty-four rats were divided into six groups: DMSO+I/R,
AKTi+ I/R, DMSO +I-30, AKTi+I-30, DMSO +R-0, and
AKTi+R-0, with four animals in each group. LY294002
(15 μM in 10 μl, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) or DMSO
(vehicle control) was microinjected into the lateral ventricle
30 min prior to MCAO surgery [6]. The stereotaxic coordinates for injection were bregma posterior (P) −1 mm, lateral
(L) ±1.5 mm, and ventral (V) −4.0 mm from the dura, with the
tooth bar set at 0 mm. After MCAO surgery, I-30 and R-0 of
RIC were performed accordingly. All rats were subjected to
2 h of MCAO followed by 22 h of reperfusion.

Tissue Homogenization and Immunoprecipitation
The tissue from the ischemic hemisphere was homogenized in
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 % NP-40, 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) with
phosphate inhibitor cocktail and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche).
Immunoprecipitation (IP) was carried out as described previously [18]. Briefly, homogenates (100 μg) were incubated
with Beclin1 antibody (3 μg, ProteinTech Group, Chicago,
IL, USA) at 4 °C overnight. Protein G-Sepharose beads
(30 μl/tube, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were prewashed
three times in IP Buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mM
sodium chloride, 2 mM EDTA, 0.5 % Triton-100) for 15 min
and incubated with a protein/antibody mixture under constant
rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. The precipitant was collected by

200

centrifugation at 10,000×g for 1 min and washed three times
with IP buffer to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. The
washed beads were resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (PAGE) loading buffer (60 μl/tube) and heated
at 95 °C for 5 min. Finally, beads were removed by centrifugation at 10,000×g, and the supernatants were analyzed by
Western blotting. The remaining homogenates without immunoprecipitation were taken as input controls and prepared for
Western blotting.
Assessment of Autophagy Level
Microtubule-associated protein light chain-3 (LC3)
undergoes successive modification to form LC3I and
phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated LC3II that is specifically targeted to autophagosome membranes [19]. Here, we
evaluated autophagosome level using immunohistochemistry
staining and Western blotting (the LC3II/LC3I ratio, showing
transformation of LC3I into LC3II) in each condition, as detailed in our previous report [6]. Twenty-micron-thick cryostat
sections were obtained and co-stained with anti-LC3 (1:150;
Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-Neuron-Specific Nuclear
Protein (NeuN, 1:50; Millipore, USA). Images were captured
using a microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
Isolation of Mitochondria from Brain Tissue
The mitochondrial fraction was isolated from ischemic
hemispheres using an Qproteome mitochondria isolation
kit (Qiagen, Düsseldorf, GER). Briefly, 20-mg tissues
were cut into pieces and homogenized in 2-ml lysis
buffer with protease inhibitor solution. The supernatant
(containing cytosolic proteins) was collected by centrifugation at 1000×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was
resuspended and disrupted in 1.5-ml ice-cold disruption
buffer. After centrifugation at 1000×g for 10 min at
4 °C, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at
6000×g for 10 min. The pellet (containing mitochondria) was resuspended in 750-μl mitochondrial purification buffer and carefully added on top of a mitochondrial purification buffer layer (500-μl disruption buffer
under 750-μl mintochondrial purification buffer). After
centrifugation at 14,000×g for 15 min, a pellet or band
containing mitochondia was formed in the lower part of
the tube and transferred to a new tube. The suspension
was washed three times with 1.5-ml mitochondrial storage buffer by centrifugation at 8000×g for 10 min. The
high-purified mitochondria were resuspended in mitochondrial storage buffer. Fresh mitochondria were used
for membrane potential detection. Stored mitochondrial
and cytosolic fractions at −80 °C were used for analyzing CytC release.

Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
The membrane potential of isolated mitochondria was
measured using a JC-1 staining kit (a dual-emission potential-sensitive probe, Genmed Scientifics Inc.,
Minneapolis, MN, USA). Briefly, 10 μl of high purity
mitochondria (containing 5 μg mitochondrial proteins)
were incubated in JC-1 staining reagent (100 μl) for
10 min. Images were captured using a microscope
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) at wavelengths of 594 and
488 nm. Healthy mitochondria, which have a high potential, showed a high intensity of red fluorescence at
594 nm and a low intensity of green fluorescence at
488 nm; damaged mitochondria showed a low intensity
of red fluorescence at 594 nm and a high intensity of
green fluorescence at 488 nm. The ratio of red/green
intensity was measured to evaluate the membrane potential of isolated mitochondria from each group.

Detection of Mitochondria-Dependent Cell Death Effector
Pathway
Isolated mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were used for
cytochrome C (CytC) release analysis by Western blotting.
The ratio of CytC in the cytoplasm and mitochondria was
calculated to measure mitochondria-dependent cell death effector pathway. The ratio of each group was normalized with
that in the I/R group.

Western Blot Analysis
Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described previously [6]. Primary antibodies used
for immunoblotting were as follows: anti-p-S70-Bcl-2
(1:1000, Abcam), anti-Bcl-2 (1:200, Santa Cruz), anticytochrome C (1:500, BD), and anti-Cox-4 (1:500,
Proteintech). Anti-p-S473-AKT (1:1000), anti-AKT
(1:1000), anti-LC3 (1:1000), anti-Beclin1 (1:1000), and
anti-β-actin (1:5000) were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). HRPconjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000) were purchased
from Chemicon (Billerica, MA, USA).

Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean±standard error of the mean
(SEM). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post
hoc correction for multiple comparisons. A p value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results
Effects of Different RIC Protocols on Infarct Volume
and Bcl-2 Phosphorylation-Autophagy Pathway After Stroke
In order to ascertain the neuroprotective effects of different
RIC strategies after ischemia stroke, cerebral infarction was
assessed using TTC staining (Fig. 1a). Both RIC protocols
significantly reduced the infarct volume (I-30 22.13 %±
3.88; R-0 33.25 %±3.28) compared with the I/R control
(47.75 %±3.33, Fig. 1b). More importantly, rats in I-30 group
had much less tissue infarction than those in the R-0 group. As
Bcl-2 phosphorylation at Ser70 (abbreviated p-Bcl-2) is reported to be critical to trigger autophagy [14], we explored
whether RIC was able to increase p-Bcl-2. p-Bcl-2 and total
Bcl-2 were measured by Western blotting (Fig. 1c). The ratio
of p-Bcl-2 was significantly upregulated in the RIC groups,
with an 11.7-fold increase in I-30 rats and a 5.9-fold increase
in R-0 rats, when compared with the I/R group (Fig. 1d).
As the number of autophagosomes represents the level of
autophagy, we detected the number of LC3-positive puncta
(autophagosomes) using immunostaining to evaluate the different level of autophagy in each group (Fig. 2a). The immunostaining showed that LC3-positive puncta (arrows) increased in I-30 and R-0 group. Moreover, these puncta mostly
located inside the cytosol of the NeuN-specific neuronal cells.
On the contrary, the LC3-positive puncta were hardly seen in
the I/R group. The transformation of LC3I to LC3II was analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 2b). Statistic analysis showed
that the autophagy level using the LC3II/LC3I ratio was

significantly promoted in RIC groups, with a 2.1-fold increase
in I-30 rats and a 1.6-fold increase in R-0 rats, when compared
with the I/R group (Fig. 2c). The results indicated that Bcl-2
phosphorylation may be involved in RIC-induced autophagy
after cerebral ischemia.

RIC Dissociates the Bcl-2/Beclin1 Complex
The Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex is regarded as a molecular switch
for autophagy formation. We investigated whether RIC dissociated the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex to trigger autophagy. The
binding of Bcl-2 with Beclin1 into a complex was measured
using IP with a Beclin1 antibody (Fig. 3a). If Bcl-2 and
Beclin1 bind as a complex, Bcl-2 would be specifically precipitated using Beclin1 antibody and would show a positive
band in the IP products. The IP results showed that the amount
of Bcl-2, which binds to Beclin1 in the I/R group, was decreased in both RIC groups. Moreover, the amount of IgG and
Beclin1 in the IP complex (Fig. 3a) and total Bcl-2 (Fig. 3b) in
the input remained constant, showing that the loss of Bcl-2 in
the complex was due to the dissociation of Bcl-2 and Beclin1.
The same protein samples without IP, which were loaded directly for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, were shown as
input for the control of IP results (Fig. 3b). The proteins in the
input suggested that the IP samples were derived from a system with the promoted p-AKT, p-Bcl-2, and autophagy level
(LC3II/LC3I) in RIC treatment. These results indicated that
RIC disconnected the Bcl-2 and Beclin1 complex, leading to
the induction of autophagy.

animals in this group exhibited significantly higher p-AKT
than R-0 (see Fig. 3b). The levels of Bcl-2 phosphorylation
in RIC-treated and control rats with or without AKTi are
shown in Fig. 4a. p-Bcl-2 was significantly upregulated by
RIC treatment, which was suppressed by AKTi (Fig. 4b).
The dissociation of Bcl-2 and Beclin1 and the autophagy level
were determined using IP and showed that the amount of Bcl2 that immunoprecipitated with Beclin1 in the I-30 group was
lower than that in the I/R group, whereas AKTi reversed the
disruption of the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex in the I-30 group
(Fig. 4c). However, the amount of Beclin1 in the IP products
remained constant. The input samples without IP are illustrated in Fig. 4d, showing constant levels of Bcl-2 and Beclin1 in
the whole lysates, with or without AKTi treatment. These data
suggested that AKT plays a critical role in regulating Bcl-2
phosphorylation to trigger the autophagy switch in RIC
treatment.

We next detected whether AKT contributed to Bcl-2 phosphorylation to regulate the dissociation of Bcl-2 and Beclin1
in RIC treatment. We focused on the I-30 group, because the

both I-30 and R-0 groups, compared with the I/R group. Bcl-2 bound to
Beclin1 in the I-30 group was less than that in the R-0 group. The amount
of Beclin1 in the complex remained constant. b The same protein samples
without IP were loaded directly for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as
the input, showing the constant level of Bcl-2. The proteins in input also
showed that the IP data originated from a system with the promoted

The autophagy level in RIC-treated and control rats with
or without AKTi was determined using Western blotting
(Fig. 5a). Bcl-2 phosphorylation in both RIC groups was
downregulated by AKTi, illustrating the inhibitory effects
of AKTi on AKT/Bcl-2 activation. RIC treatment significantly improved autophagy, when compared with the I/R
control group, whereas AKTi reversed the promoted autophagy in both RIC groups (Fig. 5b). These results

phosphorylation-induced autophagy in RIC rats.
To determine the role of AKT/Bcl-2-related autophagy in
mitochondrial function in RIC rats, we measured mitochondrial potential in isolated mitochondria from RIC and control
groups with AKTi administration or vehicle control
(DMSO). Healthy mitochondria showed a high potential
with a high intensity of red fluorescence but a low intensity
of green fluorescence. On the contrary, damaged mitochondria showed a low potential with a low intensity of red
fluorescence but a high intensity of green fluorescence. JC1 staining (Fig. 5c) showed that both I-30 (Fig. 5c (c)) and
R-0 (Fig. 5c (e)) improved the membrane potential of isolated mitochondria from the ischemic hemisphere, compared
with those from the I/R group (Fig. 5c (a)). AKTi reversed
the RIC-induced mitochondrial potential promotion in the
I-30 (Fig. 5c (d)) and R-0 groups (Fig. 5c (f)), in comparison
to the I/R control group (Fig. 5c (b)). Statistic data of JC-1
staining were shown in Fig. 5d by calculating the ratio of
red/green intensity. These results suggested that RICinduced autophagy could be beneficial to improve mitochondrial function after stroke, via activating the AKT/Bcl-2
pathway.

Suppressing Autophagy by AKTi Increases CytC Release
from Mitochondria After Stoke
To evaluate the effects of RIC-induced autophagy on
mitochondria-dependent cell death effector pathway in
cerebral ischemia, we isolated mitochondria from ischemic tissues and detected the level of CytC release from
mitochondria into the cytosol in the condition of AKTi
or DMSO administration. The levels of CytC in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were measured using
Western blotting (Fig. 6a). These results demonstrated
that CytC was significantly decreased in cytosolic fraction but increased in the mitochondria in the I-30 and
R-0 groups, in comparison to I/R rats, whereas AKTi
reversed the changes of CytC in both RIC groups. CytC
release, expressed as the ratio in the cytosol and mitochondria, indicated that I-30 and R-0 led to less CytC
release from the mitochondria into the cytosol than in
the I/R group, which was reversed by AKTi administration (Fig. 6b). These results suggested that suppressing
AKT/Bcl-2-triggered autophagy abolished RIC-based
protection from the mitochondria-mediated cell death effector pathway after ischemic stroke.

Discussion
Autophagy, an important cell clearance system for degrading
waste or impaired organelles into micromolecules for reuse,
plays an important role in ischemia [20, 21]. The Bcl-2/
Beclin1 complex is regarded as a molecular switch that regulates autophagosome membrane formation [14, 22]. The present study demonstrated for the first time that the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at S70, activated by the AKT pathway, played a

crucial role in regulating RIC-induced autophagy and thereby
conferred RIC-based neuroprotection on reducing mitochondrial damage in rats with cerebral ischemia.
Our previous study indicated that the AKT-dependent autophagy pathway contributed to the neuroprotection afforded
by RIC post-reperfusion in experimental stroke [6]. However,
how AKT triggers RIC-based autophagy after stroke is still
unclear. Our findings suggested that RIC promoted Bcl-2
phosphorylation at S70 and thereby turned on the autophagy

switch by disrupting the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex. Moreover,
AKT activation was found to play a critical role in Bcl-2
phosphorylation-related autophagy, as evidenced by the result
that AKTi reversed the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, the dissociation of the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex, and autophagy in the
condition of RIC application. These findings were consistent
with reports that the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at S70 in the
BH3 domain would change the conformation of the BH3 domain, leading to disruption between Beclin1 (a BH3-only protein) and Bcl-2 (containing BH3 domain) in response to starvation or BH3 mimetics [23, 24]. Our findings revealed the
crucial role of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in the RIC-induced autophagy pathway, improving our understanding of the protective mechanism of RIC treatment.
Recent studies have reported that autophagy exhibited a
protective effect via reducing oxidative damage and blocking
the mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis cascade in ischemic
conditions [15, 16]. The loss of mitochondrial potential and
thereby CytC leakage from the mitochondria into the cytosol
are well-accepted to activate mitochondria-directed cell injury
[25, 26]. In this study, we further investigated whether Bcl-2phosphorylation-related autophagy confers RIC-based neuroprotection on mitochondrial function in cerebral ischemic rats.
The data with regard to mitochondrial potential by JC-1 staining and CytC release indicated that RIC reduced the loss of
mitochondrial potential and CytC leakage from impaired mitochondria into the cytosol, suggesting that RIC-induced autophagy may contribute to clearing impaired mitochondria to
alleviate the downstream effect of mitochondria-directed cell
death effector pathway. AKTi experiments confirmed the role
of AKT-dependent mitochondrial-autophagy (mitophagy) in
RIC-afforded protection after stroke, suggesting that RIC reduced mitochondrial injury through promoting AKT/Bcl-2related mitophagy.
It is worth noting that in this study, early RIC application
(I-30) induced a higher level of autophagy than later RIC at
reperfusion (R-0), explaining the possible relationship between the neuroprotective efficacy of RIC at different stages
after stroke and autophagy promotion. Our findings also revealed that early RIC application (I-30) induced a higher level
of AKT/Bcl-2-related autophagy and triggered more autophagy switch molecules and less mitochondrial injury than later
RIC at reperfusion (R-0), suggesting that AKT/Bcl-2-related
autophagy may be involved in early RIC afforded immediate
neuroprotection. These results demonstrated that mitophagy is
involved in the protective mechanism of RIC and that early
RIC application is more beneficial in ischemic rats with a
higher level of mitophagy. These findings imply that it is
necessary to apply RIC treatment as early as possible to activate the intrinsic protective mechanism after stroke.
Furthermore, although R-0 did not show as much protection
as I-30, R-0 still exhibited protective effects against stroke
injury. These results provide insight for the combined

repetitive application of RIC at the ischemic stage and after
reperfusion, not only to gain short-term effects but also to
maintain enough intrinsic protective mechanisms for longterm neuroprotection. This finding is supported by a recent
clinical study in which prehospital RIC therapy after stroke
had immediate effects on reducing the risk of tissue infarction
[8]. Obviously, the long-term protective effects of combined
RIC application at the ischemic stage and after reperfusion
need to be further elucidated.
In conclusion, RIC, applied in a rat stroke model, triggers
autophagy and thereby reduces mitochondrial injury, which
requires the involvement of AKT/Bcl-2 phosphorylation for
turning on an autophagy switch of the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex.
The results of the present study provide insight on the underlying protective mechanism of RIC treatment.
