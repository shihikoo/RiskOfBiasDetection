mechanisms. Rats underwent 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and received
40 ppm or 80 ppm H2S inhalation for 3 h at the beginning of reperfusion. The effects of H2S
were investigated by evaluating neurological function, infarct size, brain edema volume,
and aquaporin4 (AQP4) protein expression at 24 h after reperfusion. Moreover, to explore
the possible mechanisms for the neuroprotective effects of H2S, protein kinase C (PKC)
activity was detected and a PKC inhibitor, Go6983, was used via intracerebral ventricular
injection. Our results showed that 40 ppm or 80 ppm H2S inhalation signiﬁcantly reduced
neurological deﬁcits, infarct size, and brain edema after MCAO. The expression of AQP4 in
the peri-infarct area of brain was also inhibited after inhalation of H2S. PKC was activated
by H2S treatment and the PKC inhibitor attenuated the neuroprotection of H2S with an
increased AQP4 expression at the same time. In conclusion, H2S inhalation attenuates
brain edema, reduces infarct volume, and improves neurologic function in a rat experimental stroke model. The therapeutic beneﬁts of H2S inhalation are associated with downregulation of AQP4 expression via activating PKC.

Introduction

Ischemic stroke, which is one of the leading causes of death
worldwide, is characterized by complex and devastating
neurological conditions (Moskowitz et al., 2010). The resulting
cerebral edema and subsequent increase in intracranial
pressure contribute to further progressive deterioration in
these patients. Brain edema induced by stroke accounts for
more severe disabilities and mortality (Manley et al., 2004). To
relieve the subsequent brain edema and minimize the disabling sequelae of ischemic stroke, a promising focus of
research is to modulate the expression of aquaporin4
(AQP4). AQP4 is a bidirectional water channel which
expresses strongly in astroglia and cerebrospinal ﬂuid–brain
interfaces (Amiry-Moghaddam et al., 2003; Kovalenko et al.,
2006). Previous study has shown that AQP4 plays an important role in cytotoxic edema in central nervous system
(Papadopoulos et al., 2002), and AQP4-deﬁcient mice experiences signiﬁcantly reduced brain edema and less severe
neurological dysfunctions after stroke (Manley et al., 2000).
Protein kinase C (PKC) has recently been reported to play a
vital role in modulating the activity of AQP4. Tang et al. (2012)
reported that the thrombin-induced down-regulation of AQP4
expression was mediated by the PKC pathway. McCoy et al.
(2010) also revealed that activation of PKC enhanced AQP4
phosphorylation and reduced water permeability. Therefore,
modulation of PKC–AQP4 may provide a new therapeutic
option for improvement of neurological function after stroke.
In recent years, hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) has been known as
a novel type of neural regulatory factor and gaseous mediator
(Lowicka and Beltowski, 2007). The neuroprotective effects of
H2S have been conﬁrmed in animal models in vivo (Joseph
et al., 2012; Yin et al., 2013) and in vitro (Kimura and Kimura,
2004; Marutani et al., 2012). However, the underlying mechanisms of H2S are still poorly understood. Previous study from Li
et al. (2011) proposed that exogenous H2S inhibited the edema
around pyramidal neurons and the nuclear shrink induced by
ischemia. Wang et al. (2014) further revealed that H2S donors
(5-p-hydroxyphenyl-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione and NaHS) reduced
vasogenic cerebral edema induced by stroke via maintaining
the integrity of blood–brain barrier (BBB). As we know, the
edema after stroke is characterized by the coexistence of
vasogenic edema and cytotoxic edema. But the effect of H2S
on cytotoxic edema following stroke is still lacking. The aim
of the present study was to investigate the effect of H2S on
cytotoxic edema after stroke and to determine whether the
PKC–AQP4 pathway was involved in this process.

2.1.
H2S inhalation improved neurological function after
MCAO
The median neurobehavioral scores evaluated by the Garcia
system are shown in Fig. 1. No neurological deﬁcits were
observed in sham-operated animals. There was a signiﬁcant
decrease in Garcia scores in the control group compared to
the sham group (Po0.05). Compared with the control group,
the Garcia score was signiﬁcantly improved both in the H2S
40 group and H2S 80 group (both Po0.05). However, no
signiﬁcant differences were observed between the H2S 40
group and H2S 80 group (P ¼0.699). To exclude the possible
impairment induced by cerebral ventricular injection, the
CIPBSþH2S group was designed in this study. At 24 h after 2h MCAO, Garcia scores in CIPBSþH2S group showed no
signiﬁcant differences compared to the H2S 40 group
(P40.05). However, Go6983 used in CIGo6983þH2S group was
found to signiﬁcantly reduce the Garcia scores when compared with CIPBSþH2S group (Po0.05), which demonstrated
that PKC involved in the protection of H2S.
In the tape removal test, all sham animals removed the
adhesive tapes rapidly [18.5 s, (14–24 s)]. However, a signiﬁcant sensorimotor deﬁcit was observed at 24 h after reperfusion, and all rats in the control group failed to remove the
tapes within 180 s (Fig. 2). The time needed in the tape
removal test was signiﬁcantly reduced in the H2S 40 group
(135 s (121.5–169.5 s, Po0.05) and H2S 80 group (138 s (115.25–
169.5 s, Po0.05) when compared with the control group.
There were no signiﬁcant differences between the H2S 40
and H2S 80 group (P40.05). The time in CIPBSþH2S group
(131.5 s (110.75–161.75 s) showed no signiﬁcant differences
compared to that in the H2S 40 group (P40.05). However,
the removal time in the CIGo6983þH2S group was signiﬁcantly
increased (more than 180 s) compared with that in the
CIPBSþH2S group (Po0.05).

Results

The experiments were performed with minimal complications and no procedure-related mortality was observed during the ischemia and reperfusion period. In our preliminary
experiment, the variables from continuous monitoring of
blood pressure and repeated blood gas did not show any
signiﬁcant differences and stayed within physiological limits
throughout middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) procedure (details in Supplementary data).

Po0.05) or 80 ppm H2S (1.3170.05 fold of sham, Po0.05)
signiﬁcantly decreased the AQP4 level compared with the
control group, suggesting that inhibition of AQP4 expression
might be the mechanism of H2S to relieve brain edema after
stroke. There was no signiﬁcant difference between the H2S
40 and H2S 80 group. The AQP4 protein expression in
CIPBSþH2S group (1.3070.15 fold of sham, P40.05) was not
signiﬁcantly different compared to that in the H2S 40 group.
We also observed a signiﬁcantly higher level of AQP4 in the
CIGo6983þH2S group (1.5870.20 fold of sham, Po0.05) compared with the CIPBSþH2S group, thus conﬁrming that PKC
activation is indeed involved in AQP4-mediated brain edema.

inhalation (i.e., reduce time needed). PKC inhibitor increased
the time again. nPo0.05 vs sham group, #Po0.05 vs control

2.2.
H2S inhalation reduced infarct size and water volume
after MCAO
As shown in Fig 3A, infarcts were detected in both cortical
and subcortical regions at 24 h after reperfusion as evidenced
in TTC stained brain sections. Compared with control group
(47.478.6%), the percentage of infarct volume, as shown in
Fig. 3B, was signiﬁcantly reduced in H2S 40 group (20.875.5%,
Po0.05) and H2S 80 group (23.273.2%, Po0.05). But no
differences were observed between the two H2S treatment
groups (P40.05). As compared with H2S 40 group, the infarct
volume in CIPBSþH2S group (21.876.3%) showed no signiﬁcant differences (P40.05). While in CIGo6983þH2S group
(42.573.5%), the infarct volume was signiﬁcantly higher
when compared to the CIPBSþH2S group (Po0.05).
The degree of edema in the ipsilateral hemisphere was
7.6572.96% in the H2S 40 group and 6.9871.63% in the H2S 80
group (Fig. 3C). These were signiﬁcantly lower than that in
the control group (21.3272.98%, both Po0.05). No signiﬁcant
differences were observed between the H2S 40 and H2S 80
group. The edema volume in CIPBSþH2S group (7.9672.91%)
showed no signiﬁcant differences compared to the H2S 40
group. The decrease in the degree of edema in CIPBSþH2S
group was signiﬁcantly inhibited after intracerebroventricular
injection of Go6983 as shown in the CIGo6983þH2S group
(18.1773.3%, Po0.05).

2.3.
AQP4 expression was suppressed in H2S-treated rats
after 2 h of cerebral ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion
As shown in Fig. 4, a signiﬁcant increase in AQP4 protein was
detected at 24 h after reperfusion in the control group
(1.6570.13 fold of sham, Po0.05) when compared with the
sham group. Inhalation of 40 ppm (1.2970.14 fold of sham,

The activity of PKC measured in sham group was 3.0370.21 nmol/
min/mg of protein (Fig. 5). A marked decrease in PKC activity was
observed after 2-h MCAO and 24- h reperfusion (1.4670.24 nmol/
min/mg of protein, Po0.01, vs the sham group). An exposure to
40 ppm or 80 ppm H2S signiﬁcantly attenuated the decrease of
PKC activity induced by cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (both
Po0.05). No signiﬁcant changes were noted between the two H2S
groups (P40.05). Our data further revealed that intracerebroventricular injection of Go6983 in the CIGo6983þH2S group produced a
signiﬁcant decrease in PKC activity in ischemic brain tissue
compared to the CIPBSþH2S group (1.6070.28 nmol/min/mg of
protein vs 2.2170.32 nmol/min/mg of protein, Po0.05), whereas
PBS injection did not affect brain PKC activity (P40.05, vs the H2S
40 group).

Discussion

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of
exogenous H2S gas on brain edema in a rat model of MCAO
and to determine its potential mechanisms. The following are
the main ﬁndings from this study: (i) inhalation of 40 ppm or
80 ppm H2S provides protection against brain edema induced
by MCAO, as shown by improving the neurologic function,
reducing the infarct size and relieving the degree of brain
edema. (ii) AQP4 protein may be one of the therapeutic
targets of H2S inhalation. (iii) PKC involves in the regulatory
mechanism of AQP4 due to H2S treatment.
The current study revealed that inhalation of 40 ppm or
80 ppm H2S for 3 h alleviated MCAO-induced neurologic outcome in rats. Our results support the neuroprotective effects
of H2S in previous studies (Kimura and Kimura, 2004; Kimura
et al., 2010) and further conﬁrm the ameliorative effect of H2S
on cytotoxic edema. Here, we found that H2S inhalation was
associated with attenuation of AQP4 expression in the periinfarct tissue, subsequently alleviating brain edema and
reducing the infarct size.
Brain edema after MCAO can result in serious sequelae
including neurological dysfunction, increased intracranial
pressure and fatal herniation (Zador et al., 2009). Emerging
studies have shed light on the molecular basis for brain water
transport and conﬁrmed that AQP4 plays an important role in
the formation and development of brain edema after MCAO
(Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Manley et al., 2000). Similar to

rats sacriﬁced at 24-h reperfusion after 2-h cerebral ischemia. Severe infarct areas were shown in the control group. The white

these studies, our results in this study reveal that the
expression of AQP4 is remarkably increased after MCAO with
obvious brain edema. Inhalation of 40 ppm or 80 ppm H2S
signiﬁcantly alleviates the brain swelling, reduces the infarct
area, and improves the neurological outcomes. The expression of AQP4 is inhibited at the same time after H2S inhalation. Since the down-regulation of AQP4 following ischemia
and H2S inhalation occurs concomitantly with a reduction in
brain edema, these effects appear to be related.
Previous evidences have suggested that AQP4 is dynamically regulated at different levels including channel gating,
subcellular distribution, phosphorylation, protein–protein
interactions and orthogonal array formation (Yukutake and
Yasui, 2010). Among them, phosphorylation is an important
pattern on regulation of AQP4. Inhibition of AQP4 has been
found after phosphorylation of ser180 and activation has
been obtained after phosphorylation of ser111 (McCoy et al.,
2010). Han et al. (1998) found that PKC strongly stimulated the
phosphorylation of AQP4 and inhibited its activity and
expression in a dose-dependent manner. Zelenina et al.
(2002) further pointed out that it was through direct phosphorylation of AQP4 at Ser180, rather than an intermediary

pathway, that PKC regulated AQP4 water permeability. In
addtion, the study with molecular docking and western blot
analysis (Bhattacharya et al., 2014) provided an direct evidence that activation of PKC can inhibit the expression of
AQP4 and improve the neurological outcome.
It is worthy to note that a previous study reported that the
PKC activity was reduced by 60–70% after 20 min ischemia
and reperfusion in rat (Louis et al., 1991). Activation of PKC
with phorbol myristate acetate decreases brain edema by
down-regulation of AQP4 after MCAO in the rat (Fazzina et al.,
2010). Similar to their investigations, in our study, inhalation
of H2S signiﬁcantly decreased brain edema, and concomitantly inhibited the expression of AQP4.
Dose H2S affect the activation of PKC? To determine if PKC
plays a role in the regulation of AQP4 by H2S, we detected the
PKC activity at 24 h after reperfusion. The results showed that
40 ppm or 80 ppm H2S signiﬁcantly attenuated the decrease
of PKC activity induced by MCAO, and the PKC inhibitor
caused a further decrease in PKC activity. These results are
in accordance with the foundings of the study from Pan et al.
(2008), who demonstrated that NaHS protected the heart
against ischemia–reperfusion insults in a PKC-dependent

that the AQP4 protein was expressed signiﬁcantly after

manner. Thus, the present data suggest that activation of
PKC is a possible mechanism for the protective effect of H2S.
To further conﬁrm the role of PKC in H2S-induced neuroprotection, the rats were pretreated with PKC inhibitor through
intracerebroventricular injection before MCAO surgery. The
results showed that inhibition of PKC activity with Go6983
reversed the H2S-induced down-regulation of AQP4 expression
and concomitantly weakened the protection effects of H2S,
which clues that the action of H2S on AQP4 is mediated via PKC.
In this study, 40 ppm and 80 ppm H2S were choose to
explore the dose-dependent effects of H2S on MCAO because
these doses were safe and low concentrations for rat (Struve
et al., 2001), and were widely used in previous animal studies
and no obvious toxic effects including the histological and
behavioral outcomes were observed (Li et al., 2008; Volpato
et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2012). In addition, some of the
neuroprotective effects of H2S had been attributed to
hypothermia (Blackstone et al., 2005). To exclude the interference of hypothermia, the core temperature in this study
was maintained at 37.570.5 1C throughout the experiments.
However, the neuroprotective effects of H2S were also
observed with better neurologic outcomes and reduced
infarct size after MCAO.
Last, but not least, we must point out that the dosedependent effect of H2S is controversial in different studies.

Fig. 5 – Effect of H2S on PKC activity in ipsilateral brain tissue.
PKC activity was determined as described in Section 4. An
exposure to 40 ppm or 80 ppm H2S signiﬁcantly attenuated
the decrease of PKC activity induced by cerebral ischemia and
reperfusion. The data are expressed as nmol/min/mg of
protein. nPo0.05 vs sham group, #Po0.05 vs control and
þ

Gheibi et al. (2014) reported that 1 and 5 mg NaHS (an H2S
donor) intraperitoneally injected at the beginning of ischemia
reduced brain edema in a dose-dependent manner. However,
Johansen et al. (2006) demonstrated that the concentrationdependent protective action of NaHS was not observed at
10 μM in the perfused heart model. In these studies, NaHS
was used as a donor of H2S. H2S was generated by the
spontaneous dissociation of NaHS. HS– and S2– were generated at the same time. So the effects of NaHS should be
ascribed to the sum of three species H2S, HS– and S2–. In this
study, exogenous H2S gas was used instead of NaHS and the
dose-dependent protective effects of H2S gas were not
demonstrated. These varying results may have been from
differences in experimental models, animals, or the severity
of the ischemia and reperfusion in different organs. In our
study, inhalation of 40 ppm and 80 ppm H2S produced the
same effects in nearly all the parameters measured. Hence
we infer that there might be a ceiling effect by inhalation of
H2S. Future studies on lower concentrations and shorter
durations are warranted to determine the optimum concentration and therapeutic schedule of H2S.
In conclusion, the current study reveals that 40 ppm and
80 ppm H2S inhalation attenuates brain edema, reduces
infarct volume and improves neurologic function in a rat
experimental stroke model. The therapeutic beneﬁts of H2S
inhalation are associated with down-regulation of AQP4
expression via activating PKC.

Experimental procedure

4.1.

Animals and surgical procedure

The experiments were conducted according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harbin Medical
University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China and followed national

brain research 1622 (2015) 292–299

guidelines (Guidelines on Administration of Laboratory Animals in China and Guidelines on the Humane Treatment of
Laboratory Animals in China) for the treatment of animals.
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats, weighing 220–250 g, were
obtained from the Animal Center of Harbin Medical University and housed at 2271 1C with 60% humidity, with a 12-h
light/dark cycle. Food and water were given ad libitum before
the experiment.
Anesthesia was performed with 5% isoﬂurane in 30%
oxygen, and spontaneous respiration was maintained with
2% isoﬂurane. Rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 37.570.5 1C during the experiment. The regional
cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) over the left middle cerebral artery
territory was continuously monitored using the laser Doppler
ﬂowmetry (TF5000; PERIMED AB; Stockholm; Sweden) over
the thinned skull located 1.5 mm posterior and 4 mm lateral
to bregma (Sutherland and Buchan, 2013).
MCAO was conducted as described previously (Belayev
et al., 1996) with slight modiﬁcation. The left common,
internal, external carotid arteries were exposed through a
midline neck incision. The external carotid artery was ligated
and the internal and common arteries were temporarily
closed by microvascular clips. A small incision was made in
the external carotid artery and a ﬁlament, with a distal silicon
rubber (diameter: 0.28 mm, Sunbio Biotech Co., China), was
inserted into the internal carotid artery. Occlusion was conﬁrmed if a reduction in rCBF470% of baseline was observed.
The ﬁlament was withdrawn after 2-hour ischemia to allow
reperfusion.

4.2.

Experimental protocol

Animals were randomly divided into six groups: sham group
(n¼ 12, rats underwent neck surgery but without artery
occlusion); control group (n ¼12, MCAO only for control, rats
underwent 2-h ischemia and 24-h reperfusion); H2S 40 group
(n¼ 12, rats underwent 2-h ischemia and inhaled 40 ppm H2S
at the beginning of reperfusion); H2S 80 group (n¼ 12, rats
underwent 2-h ischemia and inhaled 80 ppm H2S at the
beginning of reperfusion); CIPBSþH2S group (n ¼12, 5 μl of
PBS was injected into cerebral ventricle before MCAO surgery
and 40 ppm H2S was inhaled at the beginning of reperfusion
after 2-h ischemia); and CIGo6983þH2S group (n ¼12, 5 μl of
Go6983 (1 μM) was injected into cerebral ventricle before
MCAO surgery and 40 ppm H2S was inhaled at the beginning
of reperfusion after 2- h ischemia).

4.3.

Intracerebroventricular injections

Animals were placed on a stereotactic apparatus and injected
at 0.8 mm posterior and 1.5 mm lateral to bregma, and
4.5 mm ventral from the skull surface (according to the
stereotaxic coordinates of rat brain). A total of 5 μl Go6983
(1 μM) or PBS was injected carefully just before the MCAO
procedure.

4.4.

Inhalation of hydrogen sulﬁde

Just beginning of reperfusion, rats assigned to H2S inhalation
were exposed to 40 ppm or 80 ppm of H2S in a custom-made

297

chamber for 3 h. The concentration of H2S was continuously
measured using a portable gas monitor (HG–DB–H2S, Haigu
Co., China). Thereafter, rats were placed in a postoperative
cage and kept warm and undisturbed for1 h.

4.5.

Neurological deﬁcits evaluation

All animals were evaluated before the experiment to ensure
normal neurologic function. Neurologic evaluations were
performed by the same investigator who was unaware of
the group assignment. Two neurologic grading systems were
used as follows:

4.5.1.

Garcia score system

The 18-point Garcia score (Garcia et al., 1995) was used for
evaluation of the sensorimotor function based on the following six tests: (1) spontaneous activity (0–3 points); (2) symmetry of limbs (0–3 points); (3) forepaw outstretching (0–3
points); (4) climbing (1–3 points); (5) body proprioception (1–3
points); (6) response to vibrissae touch (1–3 points). The score
given to each rat at the completion of the evaluation is the
summation of the six tests (minimum score, 3; maximum
score, 18).

4.5.2.

Tape removal test

The modiﬁed tape removal test described by Bouet et al.
(2009) was conducted at 24 h after reperfusion. For this test,
two adhesive tape strips (10 mm  12 mm) were applied on
each forepaw in random order. The latency until the rat had
removed both tapes was measured. The maximum testing
time was 180 s, any removal time greater than 179 s was
recorded as “180 s”. On three consecutive days before experiment, rats were familiarized with the testing situation and
patches were applied ﬁve times per day.

4.6.

Measurement of infarct size and edema volume

Six rats from each group were euthanized at 24 h after
reperfusion, and their brains were removed and sliced into
six coronal sections of 2 mm thickness each. The sections
were stained with 2% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) for 20 min at 37 1C (Lapergue et al., 2013). To eliminate
the contribution of post-ischemic edema to the volume of
injury, infarct volume measurements were corrected for
swelling according to the method of Wang et al., 2010.
% Inf arct volume ¼ 100  ½TIV  ðIHV  CHVÞ=CHV
Edema volume of the brain was calculated using the
following formula (Ikeda-Matsuo et al., 2006):
% Edema ¼ 100  ½IHV–CHV=CHV
(TIV, total infarct volume; IHV, ipsilateral hemisphere
volume; CHV, contralateral hemisphere volume).

4.7.

Western blot analysis for AQP4

The peri-infarct tissues from the ipsilateral hemisphere of
another six rats were dissected and immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at  80 1C for western blot
analysis. Protein homogenates of samples were prepared by

rapid homogenization in Tissue Extraction Reagent II (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was measured and determined by a DC protein assay kit (Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China). Equal amounts of
protein were loaded for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently transferred onto a polyvinylidene
ﬂuoride membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA).
Membranes were blocked in blocking buffer containing 0.1%
Tween-20 and 5% dry milk and then incubated overnight at
4 1C with antibodies against AQP4 at a 1:1000 dilution (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) or β-actin at a 1:2000 dilution (Zhongshan
Golden Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China). Membranes
were washed (three times, 10 min each) with blocking buffer
and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:5000, Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, China). Bands were
detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection
system (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China),
and protein band densities were digitally quantiﬁed and
normalized to β-actin using Image J software (NIH, USA).

Detection of PKC activity

PKC activity in ipsilateral brain tissue was measured using
the PepTag non-radioactive assay (Promega Corporation,
USA). Brain tissues (1 g for each sample) were homogenized
in 5 ml of cold PKC extraction buffer, including 25 mM Tris–
HCl buffer (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA), 0.5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 0.05%
Triton X-100, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin,
1 μg/ml aprotinin and 5 μl/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF). The homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000  g
for 5 min and the supernatants were subjected to DEAEcellulose chromatography in order to partially purify PKC.
The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined as mentioned above. The samples were measured
according to the manufacturer's protocol and the absorbance
at 570 nm was recorded. The activity of PKC was calculated
and expressed as nmol/min/mg of protein, which meant the
number of nanomoles of phosphate transferred to a substrate
per minute per milligram of protein.

Statistical analysis

Data from the tape removal test and Garcia scores are shown
as median, 25th, and 75th percentiles and analyzed using the
Kruskal–Wallis test. A Mann–Whitney U analysis was performed when the overall P value was signiﬁcant. Other data
were presented as the mean7SD and analyzed using a oneway ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for post-hoc comparison between multiple experimental groups. Po0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses were
performed using SPSSs software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
