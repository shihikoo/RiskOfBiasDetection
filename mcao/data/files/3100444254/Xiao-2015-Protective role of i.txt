Abstract. Inflammation and immunity are important in
the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. Toll‑like receptor 4
(TLR4) is involved in the inflammatory responses of injured
brain tissues. Emerging studies have focused on the effect of
isoflurane (ISO) pretreatment on cerebral ischemia, however,
the association between ISO pretreatment and TLR4 during
cerebral ischemia remains to be elucidated. In the present
study, the protective role of ISO pretreatment in rats with
focal cerebral ischemia reperfusion was investigated and the
molecular mechanism was discussed. Using a middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) model, triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was utilized to measure the infarct volume and
brain edema and immunofluorescence staining was used to
detect the MCAO‑induced TLR4 expression and localization.
Western blot analyses were conducted to quantify the protein
expression levels of TLR4, myeloid differentiation primary
response 88 (MyD88) and nuclear factor (NF)‑κ B in ischemic
brain tissue at different time points. The results demonstrated
that, following ISO pretreatment, the neurological deficits, brain
edema and cerebral infarct size caused by ischemia/reperfusion were attenuated. The astrocyte and microglial activation
in the brain tissue was decreased. In addition, the expression
levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NF‑κ B were decreased. The

present study indicated that ISO pretreatment may protect the
brain from ischemic damage by downregulating the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NF‑κ B.
Introduction
Inflammation is important in the pathology of cerebral
ischemic injury. Cerebral ischemia induces a marked inflammatory response characterized by the activation and release of
cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and endotoxins,
which exacerbate tissue damage (1). Toll‑like receptors (TLRs)
have important functions in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
injury  (2). TLRs and their ligands provide an important
molecular interface between microbes and immunity and
experimental cerebral ischemia upregulates TLR4 expression (3,4). In addition, the brain damage and neurological
deficits produced by cerebral ischemia significantly decrease
in TLR4‑deficient mice compared with wild‑type mice (5).
Volatile anesthetic pretreatment significantly protects
against cerebral ischemia through several mechanisms (6,7).
Isoflurane (ISO) pretreatment inhibits excitotoxicity and
reduces glutamate release from anoxic brain slices in vitro (8).
ISO also inhibits postsynaptic glutamate receptor‑mediated
responses in neocortical and hippocampal cells (9‑11) and rat
brain slices (12). However, the exact mechanisms underlying
this protective effect remain to be elucidated. Considering
the function of the TLR4‑mediated myeloid differentiation
primary response 88 (MyD88)‑dependent signaling pathway,
the present study hypothesized that ISO pretreatment is
associated with the TLR4 signaling pathway during cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion damage. The association between the
TLR4‑induced inflammatory response and ISO pretreatment
has attracted considerable interest in developing anti‑inflammatory therapies to combat ischemia‑induced damage.
Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cell within
the brain. Although microglial cells are the first inflammatory cells to respond to cerebral ischemia, the responses of
astrocytes to pro‑inflammatory signals may also be relevant to
brain injury (13‑15). However, the association between inflammatory glial cells and TLR4 has not been fully elucidated. The
effects of ISO pretreatment on TLR4 expression in astrocytes

and microglia were investigated to increase understanding
of the association between glial cells and TLR4 signaling
pathways during inflammation. The anti‑inflammatory
effects associated with the TLR4‑mediated MyD88 activation
pathway in the cerebral ischemic brain were examined and the
downstream molecules present in rats with cerebral ischemia
were further investigated.
Materials and methods
Animal surgical procedures. ISO was purchased from
Abbott Laboratories (North Chicago, IL, USA) and was
stored in the dark. Pretreatment with 2% ISO for 60 min was
deemed sufficient to induce ischemic tolerance (16,17). Male
Sprague‑Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 270 g were
provided by the Experimental Animal Center of the Fourth
Military Medical University (Xi'an, China). The present study
strictly followed the recommendations of the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes
of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA). The animal use protocol was
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University.
Cerebral ischemia was induced via middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) using the technique by Longa et al (18,19).
The right common carotid artery and the right external carotid
artery (ECA) were exposed through a ventral midline neck
incision and ligated proximally. A 3‑0 nylon monofilament
with a silicone‑coated tip was inserted from the distal end of
the isolated ECA and gently introduced to the internal carotid
artery (ICA). The microfilament was then advanced into the
ICA ~18‑20 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation until mild
resistance was felt. The neck incision was closed with sutures
and was left in place for 120 min to induce ischemia prior
to reperfusion. The rectal temperatures were monitored and
maintained between 37.0 and 37.5˚C during the procedure.
Experimental procedures. The rats were randomly assigned
into naive, sham‑O2, sham‑ISO, MCAO‑O2 and MCAO‑ISO
groups to detect the effects of ISO pretreatment on the
infarct volume, water content, immunofluorescence staining
and protein expression of TLR4, MyD88 and nuclear factor
(NF)‑κ B in cerebral ischemia. The MCAO‑O2 group received
60% O2/40% N2 at 60 min and 24 h after the last pretreatment,
followed by the induction of focal cerebral ischemia. The
MCAO‑ISO group received 2% ISO in O2 at 60 min and 24 h
after the last pretreatment, followed by the induction of focal
cerebral ischemia. The sham‑O2 group received (60% O2/40%
N2) at 60 min and 24 h after the last pretreatment, whereas the
sham‑ISO group received 2% ISO in O2 at 60 min and 24 h
after the last pretreatment. The right common carotid artery
and the right ECA were subsequently exposed without the
insertion of the monofilament into the artery. The temperature
was maintained at ~25˚C during and following surgery. The
animals were exposed to incandescent lamps to maintain their
rectal temperatures at 37.0±0.5˚C until pallanesthesia.
Neurological assessment. At 24 h after reperfusion, the rats
in each group (n=12) were neurologically assessed by an
examiner in a blinded manner. The deficits were scored using
a modified scoring system based on the system developed by

Longa et al (19): 0, no deficits; 1, difficulty in fully extending
the contralateral forelimb; 2, unable to extend the contralateral
forelimb; 3, mild circling to the contralateral side; 4, severe
circling and 5, falling to the contralateral side.
Measurement of infarct volume. The rats in each group (n=12)
were anesthetized with intraperitoneal sodium pentobarbital
(50 mg/kg) 24 h after ischemia. The brains were removed
quickly and subsequently cut into a total of seven 2  mm
coronal sections. The sections were immersed for 30 min in
2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride at 37˚C and subsequently
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. At 24  h after fixation,
images were captured of the brain slices with a digital camera
(Sony A350; Sony Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a
personal computer.
Assessment of brain edema (brain water content). Brain water
content was measured using the dry‑wet weight technique (20).
A total of 12 rats in each group were sacrificed and their brain
tissues were quickly harvested. The 2 mm‑thick frontal pole
was removed. The 2 mm‑thick brain tissue posterior to the
frontal pole was selected to measure water content. Following
determination of the wet weight (WW) using an electronic
balance, the brain tissue was placed in an oven at constant
temperature (100±5˚C) for 24 h. The dry weight (DW) was
subsequently measured. Water content was calculated based
on the following formula: (WW ‑ DW) / WW x 100.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunofluorescence photomicrographs of the lesion‑associated cortex were obtained following
the MCAO treatment. After 24 h, the rats were anaesthetized
using 6.0% isoflurane and their brains were removed quickly
and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.1 M phosphate‑buffered saline (PBS) for 2 h at 4˚C. The cryostat sections (25 µm)
in the first dish were rinsed three times (10 min each) in 0.01 M
PBS, pH 7.3 and subsequently blocked with 2% goat serum in
0.01 M PBS containing 0.3% Triton X‑100 for 1 h at room
temperature. The samples were then subjected to immunofluorescence staining.
To evaluate colocalization, a double immunohistochemical analysis was performed, in which sections were
incubated for 48 h at 4˚C with the primary antibodies TLR4
goat polyclonal antibodies (1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, UK)
with mouse anti‑cd11b clone OX‑42 (1:300; Abcam) or
mouse anti‑glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:5,000;
Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA). The sections were washed
three times in 0.01 M PBS (10 min each) and then incubated
for 4 h at room temperature with the secondary antibodies:
Fluorescein isothiocyanate‑conjugated horse anti‑mouse
immunoglobulin G (1:200; Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA)
and Alexa 594‑conjugated donkey anti‑rabbit IgG (1:800;
Molecular Probes, Rockford, IL, USA). For TLR4/GFAP
and TLR4/OX‑42 double immunofluorescence, the sections
were incubated with a mixture of the two primary antibodies,
followed by a mixture of the two respective secondary antibodies. The staining specificities were assessed on the sections
in the second dish by omitting the specific primary antibodies.
No immunoreactive (IR) products were identified on the
sections (data not shown). Confocal images were obtained
using a confocal laser microscope (FV1000; Olympus,

Fluoview 1000 microscope (Olympus).

Western blot analysis. The protein expression levels of
MyD88, NF‑κ B and TLR4 were detected using western blot
analysis. The tissue samples obtained from the right ischemic
MCA were subjected to 120  min of MCA occlusion, with
reperfusion after 24, 48 and 72 h. The tissues were subsequently lysed with radio‑immunoprecipitation assay lysis
buffer, homogenized and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for
20 min at 4˚C. The protein content of the supernatants were
quantified using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent
kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai, China).
The remaining supernatants were boiled in sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) sample buffer for 5 min. Equal quantities of the
protein were run on SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Following blocking, the blots were immersed
overnight in TLR4 goat polyclonal antibodies (1:200; Abcam),
MyD88 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:200; Abcam) or NF
κ B rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1:400; Abcam) at 4˚C. The
membranes were rinsed and further incubated for 1 h with
horseradish peroxidase‑conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:1,000; Vector). The bound antibodies were exposed to an
Amersham Hyperfilm™ ECL (GE Healthcare, Amersham,
UK). The relative densities of the bands were analyzed and
were corrected using the values determined with anti‑rat
β‑actin, which was used as the internal control. The densities
of the protein blots were analyzed using Labworks Software
Gel‑Pro analyzer 4.0 (Ultra‑Violet Products, Cambridge, UK).
The densities of TLR4, MyD88, NF‑κ B and β‑actin IR bands
were quantified with background subtraction. Squares of
identical sizes were drawn surrounding each band to measure
density and the background near that band was subtracted.
The β‑actin levels were used as loading controls as they did
not alter significantly following inflammation and nerve
injury (21). The expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NF‑κ B
were normalized against the β‑actin levels and were expressed
as fold change relative to the control.

Quantification and statistical analysis. All the data were
collected and analyzed by researchers in a blinded manner.
A total of five nonadjacent sections (25  µm) from the
lesion‑associated cortex sections were randomly selected.
In each group, 12 rats were used for statistical analysis. The
images were evaluated using a computer‑assisted image
analysis program (MetaMorph 6.1; Universal Imaging Corp.,
West Chester, PA, USA), which set the upper and lower
thresholds for the immunofluorescence intensity determined
by the signal. The images were collected using the same
region and the same field sizes within the same lamina to
avoid variations in staining between the laminae. The same
configuration was used to measure the cell areas in all the
experimental groups. The measured areas were automatically
transferred to Microsoft Excel software (Microsoft Campus,
Redmond, WA, USA) for subsequent statistical analysis.
MetaMorph 6.1 was calibrated to standardize area measurements. A standardized field area was sampled arbitrarily
from regions within the randomly selected lesion‑associated
cortex sections.

The number of TLR4‑positive cells within the same areas
was counted. The GFAP and OX‑42 immunoreactivities and the
total number of TLR4‑immunopositive cells within the superficial cortex were averaged across the five spinal sections for
each experimental group. The number of cells double‑labeled
with TLR4 and GFAP or OX‑42 in the superficial cortex were
counted and the proportion of double‑labeled GFAP or OX‑42
cells compared with the total TLR4‑positive cells was calculated. The data from the western blot analysis are expressed as
the mean ± standard deviation. A repeated‑measures analysis
of variance with the Bonferroni confidence interval adjustment was conducted. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a
statistically significant difference.
Results
ISO pretreatment attenuates neurological deficits, brain
edema and cerebral infarct size following ischemia/reperfu‑
sion. The neurological deficit scores of the MCAO‑ISO group
at 24 h after reperfusion were lower than those of the MCAO‑O2
groups (Table I). No changes were observed in the sham‑O2,
sham‑ISO and naive groups. The infarct volume of the
MCAO‑ISO group was significantly reduced compared with
that of the MCAO‑O2 group 24 h after reperfusion (9.12±0.07
vs. 16.23±0.05%; P<0.05). The sham‑O2, sham‑ISO and naive
groups had low infarct volumes. The prevention of brain
edema is critical for the preservation of neurological function
and survival following focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.
The brain water content was examined in cerebral tissue from
the left hemisphere 24 h after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.
As shown in Fig. 1C, the brain water content was significantly
increased in the MCAO‑O2 group compared with the sham‑O2
group (87.29±0.09 vs. 79.60±0.17%). However, the brain water
content in the MCAO‑ISO group was significantly lower than
that in the MCAO‑O2 group (82.61±0.08 vs. 87.29±0.09%;
P<0.05). No significant difference in brain water content was
detected among the sham‑O2, sham‑ISO and naive groups
(Fig. 1).
ISO pretreatment reduces the protein expression of TLR4 and
significantly attenuates astrocytic and microglial levels. Tissue
sections of the right cortex were observed and the cerebral histological alterations caused by MCAO in rats were assessed using

a confocal laser‑scanning microscope. Immunofluorescence
histochemistry was employed to demonstrate TLR4 expression in the different groups. In order to rule out possible
grouping and treatment bias, the number of TLR4‑IR cells
was normalized to that in naive rats 24 h after MCAO. MCAO
significantly increased TLR4 expression in the cerebral cortex,
which predominantly concentrated in the lesion‑associated
cortex. However, ISO pretreatment significantly inhibited
MCAO‑induced TLR4 protein expression in the cerebral cortex.
Statistical analysis revealed that ISO pretreatment significantly
affected the MCAO‑induced cerebral cortex TLR4 expression.
The TLR4 immunodensity in the MCAO‑ISO rats was notably
decreased by ISO pretreatment compared with that in the
MCAO‑O2 group. No alterations were observed in the sham‑O2,
sham‑ISO and naive groups (Fig. 2).
Similarly to previous observations (22), the present
results demonstrated that MCAO significantly induced
GFAP and OX‑42 expression in the lesion‑associated cortex.
Immunohistochemistry indicated that the activated astrocytes and microglia exhibited hypertrophied cell bodies and
thickened processes with enhanced GFAP immunoreactivity
and OX‑42 immunoreactivity. Double immunofluorescence

labeling indicated that multiple GFAP‑IR cells were positive
for TLR4, whereas fewer OX‑42‑IR cells were interspersed
with activated microglia (Fig. 3). The activated astrocytes and
microglia were predominantly distributed in the superficial
cortex.
ISO pretreatment affected MCAO‑induced TLR4 protein
expression in the cerebral cortex. The immunodensities of
GFAP and OX‑42 in the MCAO rats were notably decreased
by ISO pretreatment compared with those in the sham‑O2 and
sham‑ISO groups (Fig. 4).
The data suggested that TLR4 is predominantly expressed
in the astrocytes and microglia within the lesion‑associated
region. ISO pretreatment also suppressed MCAO‑induced
GFAP and OX‑42 expression and inhibited astrocytic and
microglial activation.
ISO pretreatment attenuates the protein expression levels
of TLR4, MyD88 and NF‑ κ B. TLR4‑mediated NF‑ κ B
signaling contributes to myocardial ischemia‑reperfusion
injury (23). Quantitative studies using western blot analysis
were performed to further observe whether ISO pretreatment
affected the expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and NF‑κ B.

The protein expression levels of TLR4, MyD88 and

blot analysis at 24, 48 and 72 h. As shown in Fig. 5, ISO
pretreatment significantly inhibited MCAO‑induced TLR4
expression compared with that in the MCAO‑O2 group. The
protein level of TLR4 peaked at 24 h and lasted up to 48 h.
Thereafter, the protein level of TLR4 gradually decreased
until 72  h, although it remained significantly higher than

those in the sham‑O2, sham‑ISO and naive groups. No significant difference in TLR4 expression was observed among
the sham‑O 2, sham‑ISO and naive groups. Furthermore,
in accordance with the immunohistochemical results, the
differences between the MCAO‑O2 and MCAO‑ISO groups
were significant (P<0.05; Fig. 4).

of NF‑κ B peaked at 48 h and then declined at 72 h, although
it remained significantly higher than those in the sham‑O2,

Discussion
In the present study, the effects of ISO pretreatment on
MCAO‑induced TLR4, Myd88 and NF‑κ B expression were
examined, as well as on astrocytic and microglial activation. The present findings established the following: i) ISO
pretreatment attenuated the neurological deficits, brain edema
and cerebral infarct volume caused by ischemia/reperfusion;
ii) ISO pretreatment potently inhibits TLR4 expression and
significantly inhibited astrocytic and microglial activation

in brain tissues and iii) ISO pretreatment downregulates the
protein expression of TLR4, MyD88 and NF‑κ B.
The anti‑inflammatory effects of ISO during cerebral
ischemia injury have attracted attention in previous years.
Repeated 1 h ISO treatment induces a dose‑dependent
neuroprotection against subsequent ischemic injury  (24).
Additionally, ISO pretreatment reduces the infarct size after a
48 h delay; however, the protective effect of ISO pretreatment
may decrease after 72 h (25). In the present study, the potential
involvement of TLR4 in the anti‑inflammatory activity elicited by ISO pretreatment was examined. The present study
revealed that pretreatment with 2% ISO (1 h/day) for 5 days
provided significant neuroprotection against the neurological
injury induced by MCAO. ISO pretreatment also reduced the
water content and volume of the infarct in the ischemic brain
tissue.
Cerebral infarction is a complex pathophysiological process,
which involves multiple factors (26). Injured tissue releases
endogenous molecules, which in turn induce an inflammatory
immune response. A number of these endogenous components
are ligands for TLR4 (27). TLR4 has important functions in
cerebral ischemia and in the induction of immunoinflammatory reactions (28). TLR4, as a key component of the innate
immune system, functions as a pattern recognition receptor
that recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is one of the
most immunostimulatory glycolipid components of the outer
membrane of Gram‑negative bacteria (29). The TLR4‑mediated
MyD88‑dependent signaling pathway is essential for NF‑κ B
activation (30). MyD88 recruitment to the toll‑interleukin
receptor domain of TLR4 activates NF‑κ B, which is involved
in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (31,32).
In the present study, MCAO significantly increased TLR4
expression in the cerebral cortex and was more concentrated
in the lesion‑associated cortex. However, TLR4 declined
following ISO pretreatment. In addition, ISO pretreatment
potently inhibited TLR4 expression, which was correlated
with a decrease in astrocytic and microglial activation. In
order to understand the mechanisms involved in regulating
the inflammatory response during cerebral ischemia, TLR4
colocalization in astrocytes and microglial cells was investigated. Astrocytes and microglial cells are involved in the local
innate immune response triggered by various stressors (33,22).
Certain functions of astrocytes and microglia are ambiguous (34). When activated, microglial cells rapidly migrate
to the sites of brain damage and clear debris to maintain the
integrity of the central nervous system (35,36). Astrocytes
secrete soluble mediators, which affect the innate and adaptive immune responses (37,15). The two cell types produce
neuroprotective growth factors and neurotrophins, which
repair brain tissue. However, microglial cells can cause severe
neuronal damage when pro‑inflammatory immune mediators
are produced excessively (35). By contrast, astrocytes promote
inflammation through NF‑κ B‑dependent pathways (38,39). In
the present study, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated
that activated astrocytes and microglia in the MCAO‑O2 group
exhibited hypertrophied cell bodies and thickened processes
with enhanced GFAP immunoreactivity and OX‑42 immunereactivity. Double immunofluorescence labeling indicated that
several of the GFAP‑IR cells were positive for TLR4, whereas
a few OX‑42‑IR cells overlapped with TLR4. Notably, it was

observed that the immunodensity of GFAP and OX‑42 in the
MCAO rats significantly decreased following ISO pretreatment compared with those in the sham‑O2 and sham‑ISO
groups.
The protein levels of TLR4, Myd88 and NF‑κ B in each
group were determined using western blot analysis to
determine whether or not ISO pretreatment protects rat
brains against focal ischemia through the TLR4‑mediated
MyD88‑dependent signaling pathway. The protein level of
TLR4 in the MCAO‑O2 group was significantly higher than
that in the MCAO‑ISO group. The expression level of TLR4 in
the ischemic brains peaked at 24 h, lasted until 48 h and then
gradually decreased at 72 h. These findings suggested that
the inflammatory peak occurred after 24 h of ischemia. The
expression level of MyD88 in the ischemic brains increased
at 48 h but decreased at 72 h. In addition, the expression level
of NF‑κ B increased at 48 h but decreased 72 h after MCAO.
These results suggested that the level of TLR4 in the right
cortex is attenuated by ISO pretreatment during cerebral
ischemia. The pattern of MyD88 and NF‑κ B expression was
similar to that of TLR4 expression.
The protein expression levels of MyD88 and NF‑κ B
increased later than that of the TLR4 protein. This result can
be attributed to the involvement of MyD88 and NF‑κ B in
the TLR4‑mediated signaling pathway activated by cerebral
ischemia.
In conclusion, the present study confirmed that ISO
pretreatment protected the brain from the damage caused by
MCAO. The neuroprotective effect of ISO pretreatment may
be associated with downregulation of TLR4, MyD88 and
NF‑κ B expression. Inflammatory responses mediated mainly
by the activation of the TLR4‑MyD88 signaling pathway may
have an important function in the pathogenesis of cerebral
ischemia. The effect of ISO pretreatment on the TLR4‑MyD88
signaling pathway is important during the acute phase of ischemia and may provide new perspectives for therapeutic targets
in patients with cerebral ischemia.
