Abstract Acute inflammation plays an important role in
brain damage following cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
(I/R) injury. The present study employed a rat model of
middle cerebral artery occlusion to explore the neuroprotective effects of tanshinone IIA (TSN), which is widely
used in China for treating cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. Rats were divided into a sham-operated
group and I/R transiently occluded then reperfused groups.
Some of the I/R animals were treated daily for 7 or 15 days
with two different doses of TSN. After 15 days, triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride staining revealed less unstained area
indicating fewer lesions in the TSN-treated I/R group relative to the untreated corresponding I/R group. TSN
treatment dramatically reduced infarct sizes and reduced

Nuclear translocation of NFjB was also attenuated in I/R
animals subsequently receiving TSN. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end
labeling staining revealed more apoptosis in the I/R model
group and this was reduced in the I/R animals treated with
TSN for 15 days. Thus, TSN mitigates the severity of
damage effected by I/R.

Introduction
As worldwide populations age, the incidence of human
cerebrovascular diseases continues to increase, and ischemic
cerebrovascular diseases accounts for 80 % of these [7]. The
high incidence and significant mortality rates of ischemic
cerebrovascular disease are risks to human health [21].
Consequently, much attention has been given to understanding pathological mechanisms of focal cerebral ischemia and on finding effective treatments [6, 8]. The traditional
Chinese medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza is the dry root and
rhizome of S. miltiorrhiza Bunge. The lipid soluble constituent of this root, tanshinone IIA, (TSN) is the most abundant
active component in this root from which it can be extracted
[38]. It has widespread pharmacological effects and has
recently become a subject of much research [17, 45]. TSN
effectively inhibits cell lipid peroxidation, prevents apoptosis and methyl guanine transferase activity [9], and can
reduce cerebral infarction area in I/R rats [42]. Tanshinone
has been to protect against ischemic/reperfusion-induced
brain damage and has been used to treat focal cerebral
ischemia thereby mitigating consequent disruption of the

123

296

blood brain barrier and edema [5, 11, 29, 36, 38]. Tanshinones also inhibit amyloid aggregation by amyloid-b peptide, disaggregate amyloid fibrils, and protect cultured cells.
They have also been reported to be beneficial in treatment of
several cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases [39, 40].
This protective effect may be mediated by down-regulation of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) receptor for
advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), toll-like receptor
4 (TLR4), and nuclear factor-jB (NFjB) [36], and with
upregulation of BDNF expression [13]. HMGB1, which was
originally characterized as a nuclear DNA-binding protein
with a highly conserved structure in several species, participates in nucleosome formation and regulates gene transcription [30]. When cells are injured or become necrotic,
HMGB1, which normally resides in nuclei, translocates to
the cytoplasm and/or extracellular space [27, 34]. HMGB1 is
a key cytokine that plays an extracellular role in cellular
activation and proinflammatory responses [41]. The presence of extracellular HMGB1 has been proven in necrotic
tissue damaged by trauma or ischemia, and HMGB1 has
been identified in the active secretions of many types of cells,
including activated immune cells [18]. HMGB1 been
implicated in several inflammatory diseases [1, 16, 25, 27]
and is released from ischemic brain tissue, and is elevated in
serum from stroke patients [10, 15]. HMGB1 exerts its biological effects through interaction with its receptor, TLR-4.
Activation of TLR-4 can then lead to activation of NFjB [20,
25, 31] which will further increase expression of leukocyte
adhesion molecules and the production of proinflammatory
mediators by hematopoietic and endothelial cells, thereby
promoting inflammation and causing organ and cell damage
[32]. This is in part mediated by furthering of the maturation
and migration of immune cells leading to increased reactivity
of TLR [19, 33]. NF-jB is an important transcription factor,
and persistent activation of NF-jB makes neurons vulnerable to ischemic insult [4, 43]. In the non-activated state, NFjB and the inhibitor of jB, (IjB) are found as a covalently
bound trimer in the cytoplasm. When cells are stimulated by
physical or chemical factors, IjB phosphorylation and degradation occurs, which results in movement of activated
NFjB p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it acts as
a transcription factor to promote the production of inflammatory factors and thereby expand the inflammatory
response. IjB kinase (IKK) interacts with IjB-a and specifically phosphorylates IjB-a on site that trigger its degradation thereby effecting NF-jB activation. The functional
IKK complex contains three subunits, designated IKKa,
IKKb, and IKKc; each making an essential contribution
to IjB phosphorylation. Elevated HMGB1 and NF-jB
expression are involved in ischemia-evoked neuronal injury
and death via a pro-inflammatory mechanism [36]. Collectively, the evidence suggests that HMGB1 associated with
NFjB activation pathway plays an important role in injury

123

processes incurred after stroke [26]. In view of the reported
neuroprotective effect of TSN, we have evaluated the effect
of ischemic followed by reperfusion on phosphorylation and
nuclear translocation of HMGB1 and NFjB, and the
potential of TSN to mitigate any changes observed. The
relationship between NFjB, and the inhibitors of kappa Ba
in their phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms (IjBa,
p-IjBa), and the IKK kinases IKKa/b and p-IKKa/b, was
also explored. We have investigated the neuroprotective
mechanism of TSN in order to provide a theoretical foundation for future research. The effects of TSN on rats with
cerebral I/R injury following middle coronary artery occlusion have been studied by assessing the extent of phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the HMGB1/NFjB
signaling pathway.
Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an important
cytoskeletal component of astrocytes, which are the most
abundant population of glial cells in the central nervous
system microenvironment. They are intimately associated
with brain homeostasis and the maintenance of brain
function. Astrocytes not only provide metabolic and trophic support for neurons, they also modulate levels of
neurotransmitters and synthesize and release neurotrophic
factors, thus playing an important role in neurogenesis [12,
28]. However when excessively activated, they are also
capable of initiating inflammatory events. Shortly after
brain ischemia injury, a series of imbalances occurs that
leads to an increased number of reactive astrocytes [3]. In
ischemia–reperfusion injury, delayed neuronal death is
associated with apoptosis especially in the ischemic penumbra [2]. Therefore, in this work, we also evaluated astroglial activation using the GFAP assay and cell death
using the TUNEL assay.

Materials and Methods
Animal Treatment
Healthy adult male Sprague–Dawley rats aged
2.2–2.6 months, weighing 220–240 g were provided by the
medical experimental animal Center of Xiangya Medical
School, Central South University. Humidity levels were
maintained at 55 ± 5 %, and the rats were kept under a 12 h
light–dark cycle at 22 ± 2 °C. All animal procedures were
performed in accordance with the Guidelines of the Chinese
Society for Laboratory Animals Science. The rats were randomly divided into eight experimental groups (n = 8 each).
In the sham group (henceforth referred to as ‘control group’),
animals were subjected to the same daily treatment with saline
and the same surgical procedures as the group transiently
occluded for 2 h then reperfused (henceforth referred to as the
I/R group), but without filament fixation. In the MCAO

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:295–304

groups, the animals received a single I/R injury at the beginning of the study followed by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection
of vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline, PBS). In the TSN IIA
groups, the animals were treated as the I/R group but also
received TSN IIA (5 or 10 mg/kg dissolved in saline and
administered i.p.) immediately after surgery. Animals were
sacrificed after 7 or 15 days, and the brains were removed for
histology, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting.

Ischemia–Reperfusion Surgery
Induction of ischemia followed by reperfusion (I/R) was
carried out as previously described [14]. Briefly, rats were
anesthetized with 10 % chloral hydrate (350 ml/kg), and an
incision was made in the midline of the neck. Then, the
right common carotid artery and branches of the external
carotid artery were ligated with a 4–0 filament (Beijing
Shadong Biology Company, Beijing, China). The diameter
of the filament is 0.26 mm, but the diameter of the tip is
0.34 mm to create a globular stopper that was introduced
into the internal carotid artery and inserted until it meets
resistance. The filament was then fixed and removed after
2 h. Rats in the control group underwent the same surgical
procedure without the introduction of the filament into the
internal carotid artery. Rectal temperatures were recorded
and maintained at 37 °C throughout the procedure. The
standard of judging successful I/R is that upon recovery
from anesthesia, the rats appear to have left-sided paralysis,
difficulty standing, and circle to one side when held by the
tail. Neurological function was scored using Longa and
Bederson’s 5-point scale within 24 h after recovery from
anesthetic. The scoring is performed as follows: 0, no
symptoms of neurological damage; 1, cannot fully extend
front paws on opposite side; 2, resistance to the opposite
side drops; 3, circles to the opposite side; 4, cannot spontaneously walk, loses consciousness.

Brain Sample Preparation
At 7 or 15 days after surgery, rats were deeply anesthetized
with 10 % chloral hydrate (350 ml/kg), and the heart was
exposed to perfuse PBS through the left ventricle. Next,
PBS was changed to 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) and
perfusion continued at 10 ml/min. Brain tissue was then
collected and fixed in 4 % PFA at 4 °C overnight, then
transferred into 0.02 % sodium azide at 4 °C and stored
until use. Some tissue was rinsed with PBS, dehydrated in a
graded ethanol series, embedded in paraffin, and coronally
sectioned at 5 lm. The tissue slices were stored at 4 °C
before Eosin & Hematoxylin being stained. For 2,3,5-

297

triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining [37], fresh
brain slices were cut and placed in 2 % TTC solution for
30 min. Infarcted areas appeared as unstained tissue while
normal brain tissues stained red.

Immunohistochemistry
Dewaxed sections were immersed in antigen retrieval
solution (Vector Lab, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 20 min
[44] and endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation in 3 % H2O2, and nonspecific background staining
was blocked by incubating in 2 % bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Sections were then incubated overnight with primary antibodies raised against HMGB1 (1:500; Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) and NFjB (1:200; Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA). The sections were then
incubated with secondary antibodies and ABC reagent
(Vector Laboratories, Burlinghame, CA, USA). Finally,
the sections were incubated for approximately 2–5 min
with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (Vector), dehydrated in a
series of graded ethanols and xylene, then coverslipped
with DePeX (Biomedical Specialties, Santa Monica, CA,
USA).

Western Blotting
Tissue was homogenized in 10 volumes of Tris-buffered
saline (TBS; 20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl)
containing a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) [44]. Samples were electrophoretically
separated with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes, which were subsequently blocked with 5 %
skim milk and then incubated primary in antibodies
(HMGB1, from Abcam; NFjB-p65, p-NFjB from Cell
Signaling Technology); IjB-a, p-IKB-a, IKKa/b, p-IKKa/b
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA); and
GFAP from Dako (Carpenteria, CA, USA), overnight at
4 °C. The next day, blots were incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (1:2,000). Labeling was detected using an enhanced
chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The blots were subsequently re-probed
with antibodies to assess equal loading (actin from Sigma
and b-tubulin from Santa Cruz) following the same procedures as above. Bands were analyzed using densitometric
software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD, USA) and statistically analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Analysis of these bands was from at least three separate
experiments performed on different days.

123

TUNEL Staining
After the sections were treated with proteinase K (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA), they were subsequently incubated in dUTPdigoxin mixture followed by anti-DIG-anti-alkaline phosphatase solution. Sections were next treated in nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche,
Nutley, NJ, USA) for color development. Finally, the slides
were mounted with water-soluble mounting medium (Vector).

most of the regions using NIS-Elements AR 3.0 software
(Nikon). Statistical significance was determined by oneway ANOVA. In all cases, differences were considered
significant if P \ 0.05 (two-tailed).
Reagents
Tanshinone (1,6,6-Trimethyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydrophenanthro[1,2-b]furan-10,11-dione), TSN was purchased from
Jiangsu Carefree Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu,
China). The chemical structure of TSN is shown:

Immunostaining was quantitated using a Nikon Eclipse 80i
microscope (Tokyo, Japan), and images were taken of the
cortex and hippocampus with a high-resolution Nikon DS
digital color camera. Rather than attempting subjective
judgment of where effects were most pronounced, the use
of whole cortical or hippocampal sections also allowed
greater consistency for quantitation.
Statistical Analysis
The percentage of immunopositive area (immunopositive
area/total image area 9 100) was determined for all of the

Results
Tanshinone IIA, TSN Reduces Brain Infarction Area
in I/R
The control groups had normal brain tissue structure, whereas
the I/R groups revealed ischemic changes in the infarcted areas
as judged by an increase in unstained areas (Fig. 1a). In animals
treated with TSN, there were different degrees of reduction in
brain infarction area. Quantitation of these results showed the
most pathology in the I/R group without TSN treatment
(Fig. 1b). Pathological changes were partly but not completely
reversed by TSN treatment, the reduction being greatest and
significant only in the high-dosage group treated for 15 days.
TSN Suppresses the Increase in HMGB1 Protein
Occurring After Ischemic Injury
HMGB1 was measured in brain tissue by immunohistochemistry and quantitated by Western blotting. I/R injury
markedly increased levels of this protein which remained
above control values (Fig. 2a). Only the 15 days high-dose
TSN significantly decreased this elevation of HMGB1.
Quantitation of the corresponding Western blots revealed
that this decrease effected by TSN was apparent in both the
corresponding cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 2b).
TSN IIA Suppresses the Increase in NFjB Occurring
After Ischemic Injury
NFjB was quantitated by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3a, b)
and by analysis of Western blots (Fig. 3c). Both assays showed
I/R to enhance NFjB levels. This was reduced by TSN only in
the nuclear fraction and only at the longest duration of exposure
and highest dose used. This suggests that the migration of active
NFjB into the nucleus was impaired by TSN.
Western blotting of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions
allowed distinction between NFjB and its activated phosphorylated form, pNFjB. Compared to I/R injury alone,
the longer period (15 days) and higher dose of TSN dosing
led to elevation of the proportion of NFjB present in the
phosphorylated form in cytoplasm, but to depression of
pNFjB in the nucleus (Fig. 3d).

post-injury, but there changes attributable to subsequent
TSN treatment were limited to partial reduction of IKKa/b
after the shorter period of TSN treatment (Fig. 4a). I/R did
not alter cytoplasmic content of the de-activated phosphorylated inhibitors of NFjB, p-IjB and p-IKKa/b. However,
both of these were greatly increased by the higher dose of
TSN (Fig. 4b). These changes were not, however, reflected
in the corresponding nuclear levels of either native NFjB
inhibitors or their phosphorylated derivatives all of which
were unaltered by any treatment (data not shown).
TSN IIA Attenuates GFAP Expression After I/R
Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression was raised
several fold in I/R animals after 7 and 15 days, and treatment with the higher dose of TSN reduced this significantly

strongly reduced. These findings imply that TSN treatment
effectively attenuated I/R-induced apoptosis.

TSN Reduces I/R Induced Apoptosis in the Cortex
and Hippocampus

Discussion

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTPbiotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining revealed
apoptotic nuclei in brain tissue from all groups except the
controls (Fig. 6). The number of apoptotic cells was
increased in the ischemic penumbrae and focal ischemic
areas in all experimental groups. The intensity of TUNEL
staining decreased over time. The extent of apoptosis was
significantly further decreased after 15 days of treatment
with the higher dose of TSN. In this case, both the size of
the infarction area and number of apoptotic cells were

123

The overall value of TSN treatment was indicated by its
ability to lead to a decreased infarct area after I/R. Downregulation of HMGB1-induced NFjB activation might be
a potential mechanism accounting for TSN’s neuroprotective effects following cerebral ischemia. TSN also
significantly reduced the effect of I/R in elevating GFAP
levels, and this inhibition of astroglial activation may also
be related to the protective effects of TSN in the ischemic
region.
Apoptosis occurred in frontal cortex and hippocampus
of I/R groups. Apoptosis occurred as a time-dependent

dynamic process, the number of apoptotic cells decreasing
in 15 days I/R rats. The higher dose of TSN applied for
15 days further reduced the extent of apoptosis (Fig. 6).
The primary mechanism underlying the cerebral protective effect of TSN IIA has not yet been clearly pinpointed. In addition to the pathways suggested by the
current study, inhibition of calcium influx, antioxidant
effects, and improved Na?, K?-ATPase function have all
been suggested as primary mechanisms [39]. However,
the current results suggest that an upstream event inhibited by TSN, is the inhibition of the injury-provoked

translocation of HMGB1 to the nucleus. This may lead to
the observed inhibition of nuclear migration of both
NFjB and pNFjB, and initiate the anti-inflammatory
properties of TSN. The increased phosphorylation of
nuclear IjBa, and IKKa/b effected by TSN which implies
inactivation of NFjB inhibitors, is difficult to account for.
It may be that this apparently pro-inflammatory change is
overwhelmed by the multiple anti-inflammatory effects of
TSN.
Since ischemically damaged brains of patients show
several pathological features that mimic Alzheimer-type
dementia [22, 23], TSN may also have applicability to this
disorder. TSN has been reported to be protective against
apoptic neurotoxicity induced by b-amyloid protein [24]
and to inhibit amyloid fibril formation [35].
In conclusion, TSN reduced brain infarct area in the
ischemic hemisphere. TSN effectively attenuates the
inflammatory response and apoptosis following I/R injury
in rats. Reducing nuclear HMGB1, NFkB by retarding
their translocation from cytoplasm may inhibit inflammatory gene activation and consequently reduce the
production of inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these
results illustrate the value of this traditional Chinese
medicine approach for treating cerebral I/R injury. The
fact that TSN can significantly reduce pathological
changes following I/R has implications for the clinical
treatment of cerebral injury following ischemia.
