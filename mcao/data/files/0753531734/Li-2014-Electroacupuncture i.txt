Abstract
Background: To investigate the effects and potential mechanism of electroacupuncture intervention on expressions
of Angiotensin II and its receptors-mediated signaling pathway in experimentally induced cerebral ischemia.
Methods: Totally 126 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group, model group and EA group. The
latter two were further divided into ten subgroups (n = 6) following Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO). Changes
in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and expressions of Angiotensin II and its receptors (AT1R, AT2R), as well as
effector proteins in phosphatidyl inositol signal pathway were monitored before and at different times after MCAO.
Results: MCAO-induced decline of ipsilateral rCBF was partially suppressed by electroacupuncture, and contralateral
blood flow was also superior to that of model group. Angiotensin II level was remarkably elevated immediately after
MCAO, while electroacupuncture group exhibited significantly lower levels at 1 to 3 h and the value was significantly
increased thereafter. The enhanced expression of AT1R was partially inhibited by electroacupuncture, while increased
AT2R level was further induced. Electroacupuncture stimulation attenuated and postponed the upregulated-expressions
of Gq and CaM these upregulations. ELISA results showed sharply increased expressions of DAG and IP3, which were
remarkably neutralized by electroacupuncture.
Conclusions: MCAO induced significant increases in expression of Angiotensin II and its receptor-mediated signal
pathway. These enhanced expressions were significantly attenuated by electroacupuncture intervention, followed by
reduced vasoconstriction and improved blood supply in ischemic region, and ultimately conferred beneficial effects on
cerebral ischemia.

Background
Ischemic stroke is a devastating disease with a complex
pathophysiology, and accounts for more than 80% of overall strokes [1]. It often results from focal cerebral ischemia
due to occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel, and consequences of blood flow reduction in a brain territory are
complex that trigger a serial of multistep pathophysiologic
events, the so-called ischemic cascade [2]. The severe
reduction of blood flow to the affected tissue results in a

lack of oxygen and nutrient transportation, which in turn
interferes with intracellular protein synthesis and worsen
ischemic brain injury, and ultimately leads to tissue hypoxia and cell death [3]. It is therefore of major important
to improve cerebral circulation in acute ischemic stage,
and promotion of angiogenesis has been supposed to be a
potential therapeutical strategy.
Electroacupuncture (EA) is a novel therapy based on traditional acupuncture combined with modern electrotherapy,
and is currently being investigated as a treatment for acute
ischemic stroke. Appropriate stimulation of acupoints may
increase the blood flow, up-regulate the inherent neuroprotector activity, stabilize the ionic homeostasis, and balance
the intracellular survival and death signals in the ischemic
brain region. Clinically, EA has been reported to produce

beneficial effects on stroke patients, and experimental studies also demonstrated its effective attenuation of cerebral
ischemia [4]. Recently, our study has, for the first time,
found that EA at GV26 (Shuigou) can not only significantly
stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, but also shift its proliferation to an earlier time phase after MCAO, supporting
the hypothesis that EA can cause active angiogenesis after
MCAO insult and is an important driving force of angiogenesis during cerebral ischemia [5]. However, the underlying mechanism is still an open question and further
investigation is required for acute treatment with EA to be
widely accepted clinically, as in the present study.
The existence of brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS)
has been reported previously, and it has been found to be
involved in the modulation of cardiovascular and fluidelectrolyte homeostasis, as well as other brain-specific
function. Evidence suggested that RAS blockade may have
an impact on early mechanisms of vascular disease, such
as endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling that
underlie clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease
[6]. As a predominate bioactive peptide in RAS, Angiotensin II (AngII) has been suggested to be a significant
contributor to the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke
[7-9], which, after acting on its receptor (AngII type 1
receptor, AT1R; AngII type 2 receptor, AT2R ), can activate a
series of cell signaling pathways, including phosphatidyl inositol (PI) signaling pathways that associated with vasoconstrictor function of Ang II.
As most understood and physiologically important receptors, AT1R has been demonstrated to act through second
messengers to promote downstream effects such as vasoconstriction, inflammation, atherogenicity, cellular proliferation
and matrix production. Upon binding of the AngII to the
AT1R, a conformational change is induced and transmitted
to the intracellular C-terminus which then interacts with the
G protein. Gq, the main G protein associated with AT1R,
activates phospholipase-C β1 (PLC β1) which in turn activates protein kinase-C causing a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, increasing cell contractility [10]. In addition
to interaction with G proteins, AT1R also activates intracellular pathways, such as MAPK and JAK/STAT mechanisms.
Ang II binding to AT1R causes phosphorylation of PLCγ
which cleaves PIP2 to produces IP3 and DAG, followed by
Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C (PKC) activation.
These second messengers generated through AT1R then
contribute to the vasoconstrictor function of Ang II as well
as activation of downstream tyrosine and serine/threonine
kinases, which contribute to the growth-promoting and
cytokine-like actions of Ang II [11,12]. Long-term blockade
of the AT1R has been reported to improve the neurological
outcome and reduce the infarct volume after experimental
focal cerebral ischemia [13].
In contrast, AT2R-mediated signaling pathways and
function were not very well understood, but in general,

Page 2 of 12

appeared to antagonize the effects of the AT1R [14]. The
AT2R has been reported to be highly expressed in fetal
tissues, and then restricted to certain locations or only
occurs in response to disease [15,16]. Biochemical and electrophysiological evidence suggested that AT2R mediated
the angiogenic effect of Ang II through a mechanism that
involving bradykinin synthesis, which in turn up-regulates
endothelial nitric oxide and prostaglandin, followed by
markedly enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and reduced
ischemic volume, and ultimately resulted in neuroprotection. It was therefore suggested to represent an important
endogenous repair mechanism in promotion of ischemiainduced neovascularization [17,18].
In view of the significance of Ang II and its receptor proteins in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke, the present
study aimed to explore the potential mechanism mediating
the beneficial effects of EA from the respect of Ang II and
its receptors-mediated signal transduction pathways, and
the time-course effects of EA on experimentally induced
cerebral ischemic rats was systematically investigated within
the first 24 h.

Methods
Study subjects

A total of 126 male Wistar rats (weighing between 180
and 200 g), provided by the Animal Experimental Center
of the Medical Sciences Academy of the Chinese People’s
Liberation Army Military Academy, were used in the
study. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of Tianjin University of Traditional
Chinese Medicine and were in accordance with the institution’s Guidelines for Animal Experiments. Rats were
randomly divided into three groups: control group (n = 6),
model group (n = 60) and EA group (n = 60). Rats in the
latter two groups were further equally subdivided into 10
groups on the basis of difference in time phases, including
1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 h groups. The laserDoppler examination was only performed on the model
and EA groups, with 16 rats in each group.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model

The rat MCAO model was established using the intraluminal suture occlusion method as described previously [19].
All animals were fasted overnight with free access to water
prior to surgery. During the procedure, room temperature
was maintained at 25°C. The animals were subjected to the
following set of procedures to induce an infarct. All rats
were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 10%
chloral hydrate (0.3 ml/100 g), and an incision was made
just in the midline of the neck. The right common carotid
artery (CCA), the external carotid artery (ECA) and internal
carotid artery (ICA) were carefully isolated, and ligated
temporarily at their origin with 6.0 silk suture. Each microaneurysm clip was placed around the CCA and CEA to

Li et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2014, 14:441
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/441

prevent bleeding during insertion of the suture. A hole of
the CCA was then made between the clips with needle
(2 ml injector), the blunted tip of a nylon suture (diameter:
0.205 mm; length: 20 ± 2 mm) was inserted through the
hole until a mild resistance was felt. The two remaining
loose collar sutures were gently tightened, and the vessel
clips were then withdrawn. The section was sutured, and
rats were administered intravenously with gentamicin
(5 mg/kg per day) before put back in cages. Body
temperature was maintained between 37 and 37.5°C by
means of heating pad. The control group rats (n = 6) were
similarly anesthetized and received all the above mentioned
surgical procedures except for artery occlusion. All efforts
were made to minimize animal suffering.
After MCA occlusion, neurological behaviors were
evaluated with Zea Longa’s scale [20]: a score of 0, no
neurologic deficit; 1, mild focal neurologic deficit, failure
to extend left forepaw fully; 2, moderate focal neurologic
deficits, circling to the left; 3, severe focal neurological
deficits, falling to the left; 4, did not walk spontaneously
and had a depressed level of consciousness; 5, died. Rats
that scored 2–3 were deep anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate (0.35 ml/100 g) for
further experimentation.
EA stimulation

The EA stimulation was performed in the EA group as
described in our previous study [5]. Briefly, the traditional
Chinese acupuncture point ‘Shuigou’ (GV26, No. 26 of
the Govern Meridian) was punctured obliquely with
0.5 mm acupuncture needle, and below the GV26 about
1–2 mm, a ground electrode was located and a needle was
inserted obliquely in 2 mm depth. All rats in EA groups
were stimulated with continued 15 Hz and 1 mA electrical
stimulation for 20 minutes.
Laser doppler detection

Laser Doppler flowmeter (LDF) (DRT4 dual channel,
Moor Instruments Ltd, Axminster, UK) was used to monitor regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) before and at
different time points after MCAO. Rats in both model
and EA groups were anesthetized with 2% diethyl ether
and, after incision of the scalp, a burr hole of 5 mm in
diameter was made over the skull at 4 mm posterior coronal suture and 3 mm lateral to the sagittal suture using a
low speed dental drill. A laser probe was placed on the
dura of cerebral cortex, and the levels of the rCBF were
monitored for at least 60 s after blood flow was stabilized.
Steady state baseline values were recorded bilaterally
before MCAO and all rCBF values were expressed as
percentages of respective basal values. Occlusion was confirmed by a drop in LDF by more than 65% of baseline. Before MCAO, the rCBF value was obtained as the baseline,

Page 3 of 12

and the rCBF data after MCAO were the percentages of its
baseline values.
Immunohistochemistry assay

In view of the angiogenesis effects of AngII, immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate the level of AngII
and its receptor proteins. After the rats were euthanized,
ischemic hemisphere tissue was fixed in 10% formalin
solution and subsequently embedded in paraffin. A series
of 4–6 mm thick sections were cut for up to four sections
per animal according to the rat stereotaxic atlas of Paxinos
and Watson [21]. Immunohistochemical staining was performed employing a steptavidin- biotin complex (SABC) kit
(Wuhan Boster Biological Technology Company, China),
using the rabbit polyclonal to Angiopoietin II (1:2000;
Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-Angiotensin II
receptor type1 (1:1000; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), antiAngiotensin II receptor type2 (1:2000; Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The microscopic images were captured with a digital camera
(Nikon CoolPix 990, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and analyzed by
Image-pro plus 6.0 software. The ROD was calculated
according to the following equation: (OD of Ang II/AT1R/
AT2R − OD of background)/OD of background as reported
previously [22,23].
Western blotting

All rats fulfilling the inclusion criteria were decollated, and
arterial occlusive tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at −80°C for further use. Western blot analyses
were performed to detected concentration of CaM, Gq
proteins as described previously with some modifications
[24,25]. Briefly, samples were homogenized in cold lysis
buffer, and protein concentrations were determined using a
BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Corporation, China). Cell
lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. After transfer, membranes were blocked by incubating with 5% (w/v)
nonfat dry milk in PBS solution with 0.05% Tween 20 for
1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. Membranes
were then incubated with the primary antibodies (anti-calmodulin antibody 1:1000 diluted and anti-GNAQ + GNA11
antibody 1:800 diluted), followed by secondary antibodies
(horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG-H&L and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG-H&L),
which were all purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA,
USA), and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce). Densitometry analysis was carried
out using the Quantity One program (Biorad, Hercules,
CA, USA).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

ELISA was performed to evaluate expressions of the DAG
and IP3 as previously described [26]. After the animals

Li et al. BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2014, 14:441
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6882/14/441

were euthanized, brains were perfused with cold saline,
and tissue samples of anterior cerebral artery, distributing arteries and origin of posterior cerebral artery
were respectively separated and quickly stored at −70°C.
Samples were washed in ice-cold PBS and sonicated by a 5-s
burst for 5 times with a 90-s cooling period after each burst
using an ultrasonic homogenizer (Braun-Sonic 2,000; B.
Braun Instruments, Burlingame, Calif.) below 4°C. Samples
were then stored at −20°C for coagulation and afterwards incubated in 37°C for 5 min. After the repeated freezing and
thawing for 5 times, cell lysates were centrifuged at 1000 g
for 20 min, and supernatant was stored at −20°C for ELISA
analysis using IP3 and DAG ELISA kits (Wuhan EIAab
Science Co., Ltd, China).

Statistical analysis

All data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation
(SD), and statistical analyses were performed with SPSS,
version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). To establish
significance, LDF data was evaluated by two-sample t-test,
and the remaining data were analyzed using a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was
attributed at a P value of <0.05

Results
Neuroethology assessment

Since rats regained consciousness within 3 h postoperatively, neurological assessment was performed from
3 h following the MCAO. As presented in Table 1,
neurological behavior scores were decreased with the
time in both the model group and EA group. There
was no significant difference in the neurological behavior scores at the earlier time points after the surgery
(3 and 6 h), while the scores were significantly reduced
by EA stimulation at the later time points (9, 15, 18,
and 21 h after MCAO insult), when compared with the
model group at the same time points (p < 0.05).

Laser doppler analysis of rCBF level

LDF was used to determine the rCBF levels in the
both cerebral infarction ipsilateral and contralateral to
the lesion site, results showed that rCBF values were
reduced to various degrees after MCAO insult (Table 2).
In the cerebral infarction ipsilateral tissue, a remarkable decline in the rCBF level was observed immediately
after MCAO (0.30 ± 0.17of the baseline), and level was
then slightly increased 1 to 6 h after MCAO (Table 2).
During the 18 to 24 h time phase, value was declined to
some extent, but still higher than the baseline. The same
tendency existed in EA group, where rCBF value was
declined to 0.29 ± 0.16 of the baseline. However, at the
time interval from 1 to 6 h after MCAO, EA treatment
resulted in a transient and significant suppression of the
MCAO-induced decline in rCBF levels (p < 0.05) As
shown in Table 2, EA treatment transiently raised the
decreased rCBF to (0.49 ± 0.15) of the baseline at 1 h
after MCAO, and value was then gradually increased
until 6 h time phase.
As for contralateral side, rCBF value was only reduced
by 0.22 ± 0.24 immediately after MCAO in both the
model and EA groups, and was slightly increased at the
time intervals from 1 to 6 h. However, after the 6 h time
phase, CBF perfusion in EA group was found to be
significantly increased and became higher than that of
control and model groups. Although there was no statistical significance in the changes of rCBF levels during
the different time phases, the levels were generally
higher in EA group than that of model group, especially
at the time interval from 21 and 24 h (p < 0.05, Table 2).

Immunohistochemistry assay

As presented in Figure 1 and Table 3, a remarkable
augmentation in AngII levels was observed immediately after MCAO (p < 0.05), and reached a peak at
12 h after MCAO insult. At the time phase from 21 to
24 h, the level tended to grow again. The same tendency was obtained in EA group. Which, however,
exhibited a significantly lower level at 1 to 3 h time
phase when compared with model group, and the value
was significantly increased until 15 h and then slightly
reduced thereafter (p < 0.05). However, it exhibited a
rising trend again at 21 to 24 h after MCAO, with the
maximal value obtained at 24 h time phase.
Changes in expression of AT1R and AT2R were also
analyzed immunohistochemically. Results showed that
MCAO induced a remarkable up-regulation of AT1R level
in model group (p < 0.05), and the value was remarkably
reduced by EA treatment at all time phases after MCAO,
when compared with the model group counterparts
(p < 0.05; Figure 2 and Table 3). The maximal value of
AT1R was obtained at 2 h following MCAO, and then

Figure 3 Time-course effects of EA intervention on the expression of AT2R was investigated by immunohistochemistry assay in brain
tissue after MCAO. MCAO induced transient decrease in protein level of AT2R, while AT2R expression was found to be significantly elevated after
EA stimulation. N: Control group; M: Model group; A: EA group.

MCAO when compared with the model group, although
it was still higher than the control (p < 0.05; Table 4).
Expression of Gq was also increased after MCAO when
compared with the control group, however, the tendency
was quite different from that of the CAM. A robust elevation in Gq protein levels was observed 1–3 h following

MCAO insult (p < 0.01; Table 4). The value was significantly higher in model group than that in EA group at the
1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 h time phase, and after that, there was no
statistical difference in the Gq expression. Although Gq
level was elevated in EA group when compared with the
control group, it was delayed and blunted when compared

induced significant increases in CaM levels, and this effect was
significantly suppressed by EA intervention. While, MCAO insult
induced a transient increase in expression of Gq, and EA stimulation
not only attenuated these MCAO-induced up-regulations to varying

female rats have been suggested to sustain smaller infarcts
after MCAO compared with male rats and this gender
difference may be affected by female hormone [27]. Put
these all together, male Wistar rats weighing between 180
and 200 g were selected in the present study.
The extent of postischemic injury depends not only on
the degree and duration of arterial occlusion, but also on
the adequacy of collateral circulation. After cerebral infarction, improvement in collateral circulation generally
includes two aspects, early vasodilation (initial of collateral
circulation) and subsequent angiogenesis (collateral circulation reconstruction). Our recent study showed that EA
stimulation can significantly increase the endothelial cell
proliferation at the acute stage of the cerebral infarction
(first 6 h after MCAO), when compared with model
group. Meanwhile, the initial proliferation was reported to
shift from 24 h in model group to an earlier time of 12 h
in EA group. With that, we believed that vasodilationdependent improvement in collateral circulation alone
may sustain to 24 h after MCAO, and hence, the present
study was systematically performed at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15,
18, 21 and 24 h time phases after MCAO insult.
EA treatment could induce protective effects on ischemic
patients, but there are some characters defining the protective effect of EA treatment, especially the electrical stimulation parameters and the acupoint specificity. Acupoint
selection is the determining factor of EA treatment, different
acupoints has been employed previously to investigate the
acupoint-specific beneficial effects [28]. Based on meridian
theory, an acupoint is relatively specific to certain functions
or certain organs, and different effects occur when different
acupoints are stimulated. As the traditional Chinese acupuncture point, GV26 was specific for enhancement of
CCA blood flow [14], and stimulation at GV26 supposed
to improve the functions of CBF vessel via nerve reflex
pathway [29].

with the model group. Gq level of the 1 and 2 h after
MCAO was consistent with that of control group (p > 0.05),
and only during the 3 and 6 h time phases it was increased
to some extent and then decreased thereafter.
ELISA assay of expressions of DAG and IP3

Expression of DAG and IP3 was analyzed by using
ELISA assay, results showed that during the 1 to 12 h
time interval, MCAO induced a sharp increase in DAG
level in model group, with the peak value reached at 12 h
after MCAO (p < 0.05; Table 5). While EA treatment
partially neutralized this increase, only the 9 h DAG level
was significantly higher than that of the control group
(p < 0.05), and after that, the value was declined and during the 15 to 24 h time phase, it was significantly lower
than that of control and model groups (p < 0.05).
In model group, expression level of IP3 was also significantly increased immediately after MCAO (p < 0.05),
and reached the peak value at 12 h, coincident in time
with that of DAG expression (Table 5). The same tendency existed in EA group, where, however, the IP3 value
was significantly reduced by EA treatment at all time
phases when compared with model group counterparts
(p < 0.05).

Discussion
Animal modeling of ischemic stroke serves as an indispensable tool first to investigate mechanisms of ischemic cerebral
injury. As an ideal subject for mimicking human stroke, rat
has been largely used in molecular pathophysiology of
stroke. However, some studies have demonstrated that
certain rat strains are more suitable to use in stroke models,
for instance low deformity rates at the cerebrovascular differentiation make Wistar rats more suitable for suture MCAO
than SD rats, while Wistar rats weighing between 180 and
200 g showed comparatively low deformity rates. Besides,

Previous studies showed evidence suggested that electric
stimulation of different parameters may have different
effects on some body functions [30]. According to the
nested design study on EA combined with our earlier
research [30], stimulation parameters, with a stimulation
rate of 15 Hz and an electrical current amplitude of 1 mA
for 20 minutes, was adopted in this study.
Stenosis and occlusion of the MCA was supposed to be
the most important factors responsible for intracranial
ischemic lesions, and hemodynamic lesions in acute cerebral infarction area were primarily characterized by decline
in the CBF and cerebral blood volume (CBV) [31]. Cerebral
blood vessel has been reported to exhibit self-regulation
effects, when the CBF perfusion pressure was fluctuated
within a certain range, CBF level was maintained by the
compensatory expansion or contraction of the small artery
and blood capillary smooth muscle. However, when the collateral circulation and small blood vessels expansion were
above a certain limit, CBF level began to fall and further
developed into malignant perfusion lesions despite of
normal or slightly elevated CBV. Where cerebrovascular
reserve capacity was evidently disturbed on the occluded
side, followed by the significantly reduced CBF and CBV
values, and ultimately developed into stroke [32]. Previous
researches showed that rats with the rCBF reduction to less
than 45% of the threshold level had a higher possibility
(80%) of development into the medium-sized infarcts, while
reduction less than 55% would inevitably resulted in the
small-sized infarcts [33]. Cerebral infarction posed serious
obstacle to cerebrovascular function and morphology, and
stimulation at GV26 was suggested to promote diastolic blood vessel, reduce the cerebrovascular spasm,
improve cerebrovascular self-discipline and energy metabolism, and thereby promote the contralateral CBF to the infarction side to provide timely and effectively compensate
for blood flow.
Based on the above mentioned principle, the effects of
EA intervention on Ang II and its receptor-mediated
signal pathway were systematically evaluated in this
study. LDF analysis of the rCBF showed that MCAO
induced a significant decline in rCBF level of the infarct
hemisphere when compared with the contralateral side
(p < 0.05), with the rCBF level reduced to the (0.30 ±
0.17) and (0.29 ± 0.16) of the baseline, respectively.
While EA treatment resulted in a transient and significant up-regulation of rCBF level at the acute stage of
cerebral infarction, especially at 1 h (0.49 ± 0.15), when
compared with model group (p < 0.05). After that, there
was no significant difference in rCBF levels between
model and EA groups, although they were still lower
than that of the control group (p < 0.05). Our results
indicated that stimulation at GV26 can rapidly increase
rCBF level to up to 45% of the threshold, and therefore
improve rCBF perfusion promptly and efficiently, resulting

in the reduction or totally avoid of ischemia or infarction
in the affected area.
Activation of the RAS has been linked with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke [34,35],
and increasing amount of data showed that Ang II may
be involved in the initiation and regulation of processes
occurring in brain ischemia either in animal models of
cerebral ischemia [36] or in stroke patient [37]. The vast
majority of physiological and pathophysiological effects of
Ang II occurred via the AT1R, and they were widely distributed in the brain tissue. In contrast, the AT2R is highly
and ubiquitously expressed in certain cerebral tissue, and
its re-expression only occurs in response to disease [15].
In the present study, the positive expression of AT2R has
been found in ischemic core and penumbra regions, corroborating the results reported by Makino I [38].
Previous studies on the expression of AngII and its receptors mainly focused on the 24, 48 and 72 h time phases after
MCAO [39], and systemic evaluation of their expression
within the first 24 h is scarce. Therefore, in this study, a continuous and dynamic evaluation of changes in the first 24 h
following MCAO was established. The result showed that at
the time intervals from 1 to 24 h after MCAO, AngII level
was significantly higher than that of control. The values was
significantly higher in EA group after 6 h time phase when
compared with model group, and peak values were
reached at 12 and 24 h in model and EA group, respectively. It may suggest that ischemia and hypoxia
can stimulate the up-regulation of AngII, but this selfregulation is relatively limited without external intervention.
In our opinion, this phenomenon revealed that animal
organism has an ability of self-restoration in hypoxic–ischemic state, but this ability only has limited benefit to
cerebral ischemia as described in our experiment. With
the development of ischemic process, disturbed protein
synthesis and cell degeneration or necrosis would inevitably result in the above-mentioned phenomenon.
The previous results on AT1R expression were controversial [9,40,41], although the underlying reason was still unknown, it may be because of different observation time and
places. After the systematic evaluation of AT1R level at the
cerebral cortex (both brain parenchyma and blood vessels)
during the first 24 h after MCAO, present study showed
that AT1R level was significantly higher in the model group,
and peaked at 2 h time phase. The value was declined
to some extent during the 3 to 12 h, and then tended
to increase again. It may be resulted from the selfregulation and stimulation effects of the AngIIon AT1R
expression. Previous studies showed that expression of
the AT2R mRNA level was up-regulated at the 3 and 24 h
after cerebral infarction. However, a remarkable upregulation of the AT2R level, starting at 3 h and peaking at
15 h after MCAO insult, was observed in the present
study (p < 0.05).

Early cerebral infarction is generally characterized by
vasospasm, with less blood vessels on the brain surface.
AT1R was widely present in the brain, and was suggested to
mediate the vasoconstriction and endothelial cell injury
effects of AngIIthrough stimulation of the IP3 signal transduction pathway [4]. Recently identified effects of the AT1R
include production and release of reactive oxygen species,
stimulation of inflammatory and thrombotic processes,
which contribute to Ang II–mediated inflammation and
atherogenesis [42,43]. Our findings presented here indicated that EA at GV26 can down-regulated the expression of AT1R, which in turn promote vasodilatation,
followed by improved CBF and ultimately resulted in
the neuroprotective effect of EA. On the other hand, the
results revealed that AT1R levels increased during 1 to
6 h following MCAO, and minimum expression was at
6 h, suggesting that beneficial effects of EA treatment
may exhibit a time response. The findings of our study
may therefore provide certain scientific basis for the
future clinical treatment.
Antagonism to the function AT1R, AT2R was supposed
to mediated the angiogenic effect of Ang II through a
mechanism that involves bradykinin [17,18], followed by
up-regulation of endothelial NO and prostaglandin, which
in turn markedly enhanced CBF and reduced ischemic
volume, and ultimately resulted in neuroprotection after
MCAO. The data in this study showed that up-regulation
of AT2R expression was presented in both model and EA
treated animals. However, the value was significantly
higher in EA group, and this up-regulation was also
observed to start earlier (2 h after MCAO) when compared with model group (3 h after MCAO), indicating that
stimulation at GV26 can not only up-regulate expression
of AT2R, but also shift its up-regulation to an earlier time.
Put these all together we can see that AngIIexhibited a
vasoconstriction effect via AT1R, the primary characteristic of early cerebral infarction. EA treatment at GV26
inhibited AngIIexpression, which in turn reduced its combination with AT1R and thereby alleviated vasoconstriction. With the development of ischemia, the damage
factors such as peroxide and oxygen free radicals were
accumulated in the brain, along with the enhanced expression of AT2R, which in turn promoted its combination
with the upregulated AngII, and ultimately improved the
cerebral ischemia.
However, this regulation effect only had the limited
benefit, and EA treatment can not reverse cerebral ischemia. With the development of the ischemia and increase
in cells degeneration or necrosis, AngIIlevel would inevitably decline. Whereas the value tended to increase again
at the 24 h time phase, it may be because that EA treatment can promote the growth of glial cells, which not only
replaced the necrotic cells, but also acted as the primary
synthetic cells that stimulating AngIIexpression. Our results

Page 10 of 12

suggested that stimulation at GV26 can regulate the expression of AngIIto exert beneficial effects on cerebral infarction.
AngII, when bound to AT1R, would initiate mechanisms
that would increase heart contractile force, vascular tone,
and constriction of vessels [7]. AT1R was suggested to act
through second messengers to promote downstream effects
such as vasoconstriction, atherogenicity, cellular proliferation and matrix production, while AT2R expression was
supposed to be restricted to certain locations or only
occurred in response to disease [15,16].
Therefore, in addition to evaluation of changes in
AngIIand its receptors levels, expression of the effector
proteins in the AngIIreceptor mediated IP3 signal transduction pathway were also determined in this study. Western
blotting results showed that MCAO induced a significant
increase in Gq and CaM expressions, although different
tendencies could been seen between the two values. Briefly,
CaM level was significantly higher at all time phases after
MCAO, and EA treatment induced a pronounced suppression of CaM expression, although it was still higher than
control (p < 0.05). By contrast, a robust elevation in Gq
level was observed mainly at 1 to 3 h following MCAO insult, EA treatment not only attenuated the MCAO-induced
enhancement of Gq expression, but also shifted it to a later
time at 6 h after MCAO (p < 0.05). ELISA assay was
performed to determine the amounts of DAG and IP3 produced after MCAO, results showed that expression levels
of DAG and IP3 were sharply increase 1–12 h following
MCAO, and peak expression was at 12 h (p < 0.05). After
EA treatment, however, these increases were remarkably
neutralized when compared with model group. The results
presented here suggested that MCAO induced a sharp
increase in expression of the effector proteins in AngII
receptor mediated IP signal transduction pathway. These
enhanced expressions were significantly suppressed by EA
treatment, followed by the reduction of the MCAO-induced
vasoconstriction, which in turn improved blood supply in
the ischemic region, and ultimately exerted beneficial effects
on cerebral ischemia.

Conclusions
Stimulation at GV26 may prove to be useful in partially
reverse the MCAO-induced up-regulations of AngII and
its receptor mediated IP3 signal transduction pathway,
followed by reduced vasoconstriction and improved
blood supply in ischemic region, and ultimately conferred beneficial effects on cerebral ischemia.
