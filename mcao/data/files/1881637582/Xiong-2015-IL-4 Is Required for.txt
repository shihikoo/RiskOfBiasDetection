Background and Purpose—Interleukin (IL)-4 protects from middle cerebral artery occlusion in male mice. Females
generally show less injury in response to the same ischemic challenge, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully
understood. We tested the importance of IL-4 in female protection using IL-4 knockout (KO) mice.
Methods—IL-4 KO and wild-type (WT) mice of both sexes were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion. Infarct
volume was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and neurobehavioral outcome by neuroscore. T cell
proliferation was assessed after Concanavalin A exposure. Ischemic brain immune cell populations were analyzed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunostaining.
Results—Infarction in WT females during estrus and proestrus phases was significantly smaller than in males; neurological
score was better. Infarction volume was larger and neurological score worse in IL-4 KO compared with WT in both
sexes, with no sex difference. Proliferation of T cells was inhibited in WT females with higher proliferation and no sex
difference in IL-4 KO. Macrophage numbers and total T cells in the ischemic hemisphere were lower in WT females, and
monocytes increased markedly in IL-4 KOs with no sex difference. The reduced macrophage infiltration in WT-females
was predominantly M2. Loss of IL-4 increased CD68+ and iNOS+ cells and reduced YM1+ and Arg1+ cells in both
sexes.
Conclusions—IL-4 is required for female neuroprotection during the estrus phase of the estrus cycle. Protected WT
females show a predominance of M2-activated microglia/macrophages and reduced inflammatory infiltration. Increasing
macrophage M2 polarization, with or without added inhibition of infiltration, may be a new approach to stroke
treatment.   (Stroke. 2015;46:2271-2276. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.008897.)

troke is one of the leading causes of disability and death
worldwide, yet treatment options are limited to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in nonhemorrhagic stroke
within the first few hours.1 Thus, alternative strategies for
brain protection are still urgently needed. Stroke is sexually
dimorphic. Women have a reduced incidence of stroke compared with men until well into old age, but poorer functional
outcomes after stroke.2,3 The phases of the estrus cycle also
affect stroke outcome.4 Female sex hormones, especially
estrogen,5 reduce the consequences of ischemia by multiple
mechanisms6 and moderate inflammation.7,8 In addition, male
and female brain cells differ in the apoptotic cell death pathways invoked, even in the absence of added hormones, with
the male more dependent on poly ADP ribose polymerase
activation, leading to apoptosis inducing factor translocation. In the female, poly ADP ribose polymerase is protective

against middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and inhibition leads to worsened outcome, the opposite of the result in
male mice.9 Sex disparate effects were also seen in studies of
a g-protein–coupled estrogen receptor agonist.10
Inflammation poststroke is a critical determinant of outcome, with both detrimental effects, such as causing secondary injury, and beneficial effects, including phagocytosis of
debris, contributing to healing and recovery.11,12 The protective effects of estrogen in cardiovascular disease have been
suggested to favorably influence the balance of M1/M2 macrophage activation.13 After stroke, the resident microglia are
activated rapidly, and peripheral immune cells, including
monocytes, neutrophils, and T and B cells, infiltrate the ischemic brain, interacting with each other and with brain cells,
though the roles of these different cell types and their different
activation patterns remain poorly understood.

Microglia/macrophages are highly plastic cells that can
assume diverse phenotypes and engage different functional
programs in response to specific microenvironmental signals.
Though classically macrophages were described as having 2
distinct activation states, classically activated/proinflammatory macrophages (M1) and alternatively activated/resolving,
regenerating macrophages (M2), it is now clear that there is
a spectrum of phenotypes.14 Although the timecourse of M1
and M2 macrophages has been studied, and M2 suggested to
be beneficial,15 it is clear that we do not fully understand the
different roles of these different phenotypes because treatment with M2 macrophages after stroke did not improve
outcome.16 In our previous study, the absence of interleukin
(IL)-4 resulted in larger infarcts related to greater Th1 cell and
microglia/macrophage infiltration into the ischemic brain in
male IL-4 knockout (IL-4 KO) mice compared with wild-type
(WT).17
Despite the importance of IL-4 signaling in male stroke,17
the importance of IL-4 in female stroke is unknown, and the
mechanism(s) remains unclear.

Methods
Animals
BALB/cJ and IL-4 KO mice (BALB/c-IL-4tm2Nnt/J) from Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) were bred in our animal facility as homozygotes. Mice were housed in the Stanford Medical School Animal
Care Facility, and all use of animals was according to protocols approved by the Stanford Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
and conducted according to the National Institute of Health (NIH)
Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. A total of 241 mice
survived and were analyzed out of a total of 318 mice. Breakdown
by sex and genotype is described in the Table in the online-only Data
Supplement.

Vaginal Smears for Estrus Cycle Stage
Determination
Vaginal cells from female mice were evaluated for the presence of
white blood cells and morphology of epithelial cells to determine the
stage of the estrus cycle after staining with HEMA3 (Fisher Scientific,
Kalamazoo, MI), see Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement.18

Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia, Neurological
Evaluation
Male and female mice 10 to 12 weeks old were randomized to treatment groups, then anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in O2 by face
mask. The middle cerebral artery was occluded for 1 hour with a
silicone-coated 6-0 monofilament (Doccol Corp, Redlands, CA) as
previously.17 The suture was not inserted in sham-operated mice.
Neurological status was scored17 by a blinded investigator at 48
hours, with scores 0, no observable deficit, to 4, unable to walk spontaneously and depressed level of consciousness. Mice that showed
no neurological deficit and brains with evidence of hemorrhage were
excluded from analysis.

Measurement of Cerebral Infarction Area
Forty-eight hours after MCAO, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, decapitated, and brains sectioned coronally with a rodent brain
slicer matrix (Zivic Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA). Sections were incubated in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and infarction
volume determined by a blinded observer using 4 slices per mouse
and corrected for edema using NIH Image J (Image J 1.37v, Wayne
Rasband, available from NIH) as previously.17

Immunofluorescence Staining
Mice were euthanized with isoflurane overdose, perfused with icecold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4), followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS as previously.17 After postfixation for 72
hours, 50 μm coronal brain sections were cut. Free-floating sections
were incubated for 1 hour with blocking solution (0.1 mol/L PBS,
0.1% Triton X-100, and 5% normal goat serum), then for 48 hours at
4°C with anti-CD68 antibody (1:100; MCA1957GA, AbD Serotec,
Kidlington, Oxford, UK),19 antimyeloperoxidase antibody (diluted
1:50, No. A0398; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), anti-Ym1 (1:100, No.
01404; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada), antiarginase
1 (1:100, No. 610708; BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Jose, CA),
and antimouse inducible nitric oxide synthase+ (iNOS;1:100, No.
610329; BD Biosciences Pharmingen).20 Sections were rinsed, incubated 2 hours at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
goat antirabbit (antimyeloperoxidase), goat antirat (CD68), goat antimouse (iNOS and arginase 1), or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat
antirabbit (Ym1; all diluted 1:400 [Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA]), then
washed and mounted on glass slides with Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).
Negative controls without primary antibodies were performed in parallel and showed no staining. Fluorescence micrographs were made
with a Zeiss Axiovert inverted epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss
LSM510, Jena, Germany), covering 0.14 mm2. Three sections (−1.70
to −2.18 relative to Bregma)/mouse were randomly chosen and the
number of CD68 or antimyeloperoxidase expressing cells in the core
was counted using Image J; counts for each animal were averaged.
Counts were performed on coded sections by a blinded investigator.

Carboxyfluorescein Succinimidyl Ester–Labeled
Splenocytes, Mitogen-Induced Proliferation
Mice were euthanized with an isoflurane overdose. To isolate splenic
mononuclear leukocytes, spleens were chopped into small pieces, homogenized, filtered through a 70 μm strainer, and centrifuged at 250g
for 5 minutes. After red blood cells were lysed using ACK Lysing
buffer (GIBCO; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), cells were labeled with
2 μM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen) and resuspended in RPMI1640 medium with 10% FBS. Carboxyfluorescein
succinimidyl ester–labeled splenocytes at 2×105 cells/well in 96 well
flat-bottom tissue culture plates were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2
for 66 hours in the presence of 1 μg/mL T cell mitogen Concanavalin
A (Sigma-Aldrich, Santa Clara, CA), then carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester dilution was quantified by flow cytometry.21

Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting Analyses for
Immune Cells
Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane 48 hours after reperfusion, transcardially perfused with cold PBS, and the ischemic hemisphere was analyzed. Brain microglia and mononuclear leukocytes
were collected as previously.22 Cells were stained with fluorochromelabeled mAbs against CD45 (FITC), CD11b (APC), CD3 (PECy7),
CD4 (APCCy7), CD8 (Pacific Blue; BioLegend Inc, San Diego,
CA) on ice for 30 minutes. Data on stained samples were acquired
on a BD LSR II flow cytometer using Diva software (v6.1.2; Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and analyzed using FlowJo software
(v7.6.2; Tree Star, Ashland, OR).

Statistical Analyses
Data are expressed as mean±SD with P<0.05 considered significant.
Student’s t-tests were used to compare 2 groups, 2-way analysis of
variances were used to assess contributions of genotype and sex, followed by Bonferroni post-tests using Prism 5 (GraphPAD, San Diego,
CA). One-way analysis of variance was used to compare all female
WT to male WT for infarct and neuroscore. For the fluorescenceactivated cell sorting data, 2-way analysis of variance was performed
on log transformed data, followed by Student’s t test to compare pairs
of conditions using the Benjamini–Hochberg method for multipletesting correction to control the false-discovery-rate.

Results
Female IL-4 KO Mice Fail to Show Protection
The 4 stages of the estrus cycle were determined by histological analysis of vaginal smears (Figure I in the online-only
Data Supplement). Infarction volumes 48 hours post-MCAO
were measured in males and in all 4 phases of the estrus cycle
for females for WT and IL-4 KO mice (Figure 1A and 1B).

Infarction volumes in WT female mice during estrus and proestrus but not during diestrus and metestrus were significantly
smaller than in WT male mice, and the neurological score
showed significantly better function (Figure 1C). Estrus and
proestrus are the phases of the cycle with higher estrogen levels. As previously reported,17 infarction volume was larger in
IL-4 KO male mice compared with WT. Similarly, the female
IL-4 KO mice had larger infarcts and the neurological score
was significantly worse in both sexes. Loss of IL-4 abolished
the sex difference in infarct size, neurological deficit, and the
variation with phase of the estrus cycle (Figure 1A–1C).

Reduced Concanavalin A Stimulated Splenocyte
Proliferation in WT Females During Estrus

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

For the rest of these studies, we evaluated male mice and
female mice in the estrus phase of the estrus cycle, one of
the 2 phases during which they show significant protection
(Figure 1) and elevated estrogen levels. We evaluated the proliferative ability of splenocytes stimulated by Concanavalin
A from WT and IL-4 KO mice. Proliferation of T cells was
significantly lower in WT females during the estrus phase of
the cycle compared with male mice, proliferation increased
significantly in IL-4 KO mice (Figure 2A and 2B) with loss of
sex differences with loss of IL-4 (Figure 2A and 2B).

WT Female Mice Have Fewer Mononuclear Cells in
Ischemic Brain
We assessed microglia (CD45interCD11b+), monocytes/macrophages (CD45highCD11b+), total T cells (CD45highCD3+), CD8
(CD45highCD3+CD8+), and CD4 T cells (CD45highCD3+CD4+) in
the ischemic hemisphere 48 hours post-MCAO by fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (Figure 3A and 3B). There were significantly fewer T cells in the ischemic hemisphere of WT female
mice during the estrus phase compared with WT male mice. In
IL-4 KO mice, the numbers of these immune cells were sharply
increased for all cell types relative to WT, and there were no
longer significant sex differences (Figure 3B).

male KO mice. IL-4 KO significantly increased infarct volume

shown on each bar.

We evaluated sex differences in macrophage activation patterns in the ischemic core 48 hours post-MCAO (Figure 4A)
by immunostaining for expression of CD68 (reactive microglia/macrophages; Figure 4B). CD68+ cells were significantly
fewer in WT females during estrus compared with WT males,
but increased in both sexes of IL-4 KO mice such that there
was no significant difference (Figure 4B). The number of cells
expressing the M2 polarization markers, YM1 or Arg-1, was
significantly higher in WT females than males, whereas IL-4
KO reduced numbers of YM1 and Arg-1-positive cells in both
sexes (Figure 5A and 5B). In a reciprocal fashion, numbers
of iNOS (an M1-associated marker)-expressing cells were
increased by loss of IL-4 in both sexes (Figure 4C) and did
not differ by sex. Staining for antimyeloperoxidase for neutrophils showed significantly fewer infiltrating cells in the
ischemic core of female mice in estrus than in male mice. The
number of cells increased markedly and the sex difference was
abolished with loss of IL-4 (Figure 5C).

Discussion
Inflammation plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of
ischemia-induced brain injury23,24; however, the mechanisms
by which inflammation contributes to sex differences in stroke
largely remain to be elucidated. Here loss of IL-4 abolished
sex differences in infarct volume, neuroscore, and infiltrating immune cells. Protected WT female mice had more cells
expressing the M2 markers YM1 and Arg-1 and fewer T cells
and neutrophils. These differences were lost in the absence of
IL-4. Thus, IL-4 seems to play a central role in female protection.
A picture is beginning to emerge of the changes in immune
cells in the brain after stroke,15,25 though the data in female rodents
is much less than in males. Banerjee and colleagues26 compared
male and female mice after MCAO and reported fewer CD45hi/
CD11b+ cells in brains of females than in males, and a trend to
more CD4+ cells in males, consistent with our results. They did

not distinguish CD45hi from CD45inter but did find more CD45hi
in male brains and pointed out an increase in a subset of CD8+
T cells that secrete IL-10 in females after stroke. Similar to our
data, this indicates females have a more anti-inflammatory activation with increased IL-10 and increased IL-4 effects. Circulating
monocyte subtypes have been shown to predict clinical course
in human stroke with a CD14dimCD16+ phenotype proposed to
promote repair and associated with better outcome.27
IL-4 plays a central role in the differentiation of Th2 cells
that produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and in suppressing
generation of Th1 cells, which produce proinflammatory cytokines. M1 and M2 macrophages are inducers and effectors in
Th1 and Th2 immunity. We previously found IL-4 KO resulted
in greater Th1 and microglia/macrophage infiltration and
increased Th1/Th2 ratio in males.17 Microglia/macrophages
respond dynamically with M2 phenotype detected early after

the gating strategy for immune cell subpopulations. B, Bar graphs show the quantification of cells/ischemic hemisphere for each subpopulation. WT female brains (estrus phase) generally show fewer infiltrating cells than male brains (*P<0.05, ** P<0.01), whereas IL-4 KO
increases the number of all cell types significantly (#P<0.05; ##P<0.01; ###P<0.001) and eliminates the male female difference. N=6/group.

stroke then diminishing, whereas M1 phenotype increased
with time and persisted.15 An earlier study found macrophage
brain infiltration peaked at 3 days, but did not evaluate M1
versus M2 markers.25 Here we found fewer Ym1+ and Arg-1+
cells in males and fewer activated microglia/macrophages and
neutrophils in females. M2 cells decreased, whereas the others cells all markedly increased with IL-4 KO, abolishing sex
differences.
Although there was no difference in iNOS-positive cells
(an M1 marker) between male and female WT, the ratio of M1
to M2 is different by sex in WT, and this is lost with loss of
IL-4, with the change greater in female mice. Consistent with
the literature, we find that IL-4 is a key factor in determining
the M1/M2 balance, and this balance in macrophage/microglial activation seems central to sex differences and female protection from stroke. Although it is impossible to conclusively
state that increased numbers of M2 activated cells causes
reduced infarct size because reduced infarct size from any
cause may be associated with reduced inflammatory infiltration, our results are consist with those of others suggesting

that a balance of activation shifted toward the M2 phenotype
is associated with smaller infarct size.19
Estrogen is thought to play a key role in ischemic protection of female rodents and people. A recent study by Manwani
and colleagues28 demonstrated the central role of gonadal
hormones in brain ischemic susceptibility. Earlier work has
suggested multiple mechanisms for protection by estrogen,
including antioxidant effects, immune regulatory effects, and
effects on cell death pathways (for review).8
Our study has several limitations. We have conducted a
preliminary study of T cell subtypes and characterized some
markers that distinguish monocyte subtypes and activation
pattern, but additional studies are needed to investigate the

2276  Stroke  August 2015
range of immune cell phenotypes and how they evolve over
time, especially in females. The IL-4 KO mice used may have
some compensatory changes; however, our prior study in male
mice demonstrated that giving IL-4 restored infarct volume to
that of WT, suggesting the phenotype largely reflects loss of
IL-4. We have repeated these studies with female mice and
find similar results, administration of IL-4 to KO females
reduces infarct size significantly, and IL-4 administration to
WT does not alter infarct volume (Figure II in the online-only
Data Supplement).
In conclusion, IL-4 is key in sex-dependent protection
from stroke, affecting lymphocyte proliferation and infiltration, microglia/macrophage, and T cell activation and differentiation. Increasing M2 activation and reducing immune cell
infiltration are potential targets for future stroke therapy.

Representative micrograph of vaginal smears shows the four phases of the estrus cycle. Estrus cycle
phases were determined by histological evaluation of vaginal smears. The presence of white blood
cells and the morphology of epithelial cells was assessed after staining with the HEMA 3 stain.
Diestrus: polymophonuclear lymphocytes (PMNs) present, proestrus: nucleated and cornified cells
present, estrus: cornified epithelial cells present, metestrus: cornified epithelial cells and PMNs present.

Methods
Treatment with Recombinant Human IL-4
Recombinant human IL-4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was injected intracerebroventricularly.
Female WT and IL-4 KO mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in O2 by face mask and placed in a
stereotaxic frame with a mouse head holder. Either vehicle (0.1% bovine serum albumin in 0.9%
phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) or 1 µg of recombinant human IL-4 dissolved in vehicle was infused
in 5 µL (over 15 minutes) into the right lateral ventricle through a burr hole 60 minutes before MCAO, as
previously described (1). The bone wound was closed with bone wax and the mouse prepared for
MCAO. After 1 hr MCAO and 24 hours of reperfusion, the animals were assessed for neuroscore, and
the brains removed for 2,3,5-triphenyltrazolium chloride (TTC) staining.

Figure Legend Supplemental Figure II
Effects of IL4 administration in WT and IL-4 KO female mice subjected to MCAO. Female mice of WT
or IL-4 KO genotype were infused intracerebroventricularly with recombinant IL-4 or vehicle prior to
undergoing MCAO. Neurological score was assessed 24 hr after MCAO. Brains were then collected for
assessment of infarct volume.
A. Infarct volume was assessed by TTC staining. Il-4 KO mice had larger infarcts than WT when
injected with vehicle, and this was significantly reduced by treatment with IL-4. * indicates a P < 0.05
compared to vehicle treated WT; # indicates p < 0.05 compared to vehicle injected IL-4 KO. Numbers
of mice/group 9 WT + IL-4; 10 WT + vehicle; 9 IL-4 KO + IL-4; 6 IL4 KO + vehicle.
B. Neurological deficit score was assessed 24 hr after MCAO. * indicates p < 0.05 compared to WT
with vehicle.
Values shown are mean + SD.
