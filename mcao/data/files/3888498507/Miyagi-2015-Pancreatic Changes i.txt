Regulation of blood glucose levels as a therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia plays an important role
in suppressing neuronal damage. In particular, suppression of post-ischemic glucose intolerance improves
cerebral ischemia. We have reported that cerebral ischemia induces glucose intolerance and an increase in
plasma insulin levels. However, the mechanism of insulin secretion after cerebral ischemia is unclear. Nerve
growth factor (NGF), a member of the neurotrophin family, has high afﬁnity for tropomyosin-related kinase
A (TrkA). NGF/TrkA signaling is associated with neuronal survival, differentiation, and function. Recently,
NGF/TrkA signaling has been reported to be associated with insulin synthesis and secretion. In the present
study, we evaluated the insulin content and expression of NGF/TrkA by immunoﬂuorescence and Western
blotting after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as a cerebral ischemia model. At 6, 12, and 24 h after
MCAO, insulin contents were increased in MCAO mice. The expression of NGF was increased at 6, 12, and
24 h, whereas the expression of TrkA tended to decrease in pancreas after MCAO. These results suggest that
NGF/TrkA signaling is an important factor in cerebral ischemia-induced insulin synthesis and secretion in
the pancreas.

Diabetes and hyperglycemia are important risk factors in
the development of cerebral ischemia, including stroke and
elevated neuronal damage.1,2) In the clinical ﬁeld, cerebral
ischemia induces hyperglycemia, including glucose intolerance.3,4) The maintenance of normal blood glucose levels after
cerebral ischemia improves prognoses for neuronal damage
and death rate.2) In our previous studies, post-ischemic glucose
intolerance was induced by focal cerebral ischemia, mediated
by cerebral ischemia-induced insulin resistance via a decrease
in hepatic insulin receptors and accompanied by an increase
in gluconeogenic enzymes.5) We have clearly conﬁrmed that
plasma insulin levels are drastically increased by cerebral
ischemia.6) However, the mechanisms of insulin regulation
under ischemic conditions remain unknown.
Insulin is synthesized and secreted in the pancreas. Hyperglycemia and/or diabetes increase insulin contents and its
synthesis in the pancreas.7) Interestingly, insulin itself has
a neuroprotective effect and improves cerebral ischemia by
reducing blood glucose levels following systemic administration.6,8)
In general, neurotrophins, such as nerve growth factor
(NGF) and its receptor, tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA),
a member of the tropomyosin-related kinase family (Trk), are
involved in neuronal development, differentiation, and function.9) Recently, it has been reported that NGF/TrkA signaling is associated with systemic glucose metabolism.10) NGF
is also synthesized and TrkA is expressed in β cells in the
pancreas.1) The activation of NGF/TrkA signaling increased
insulin synthesis, and its secretion is promoted by glucose
stimulation.11,12) Under hyperglycemic conditions, NGF mRNA
is increased in the pancreas.2) In contrast, increased insulin
secretion under hyperglycemic conditions induces the upregulation of NGF in the pancreas.13) It is thus possible that
pancreatic NGF/TrkA signaling is associated with systemic

glucose metabolism.
In the present study, we investigated the effect of insulin
conditions in the pancreas on changes in the expression of
NGF/TrkA after cerebral ischemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics Approval of the Study Protocol All procedures
were in accordance with the Guiding Principles for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals adopted by the Japanese Pharmacological Society. The study protocol was approved by the
Animal Ethics Committee of Kobe Gakuin University, Kobe,
Japan (approval number: A14–21).
Animals Male ddY mice (5 weeks old; Japan SLC, Inc.,
Shizuoka, Japan) were housed in an animal room maintained
at 24°C and 55±5% humidity on a 12-h light–dark cycle (light
phase, 08:00–20:00). Mice were provided with food and water
ad libitum.
Animal Model of Focal Cerebral Ischemia The experimental transient focal ischemia mouse model was produced by
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion as
described previously.14) In brieﬂy, the MCAO was performed
under isoﬂurane anesthesia. The common carotid artery
(CCA) and external carotid artery were ﬁrst ligated, followed
by isolation of the internal carotid artery. The left middle
carotid artery was occluded for 2 h by the insertion of an 8-0
nylon monoﬁlament with a thin silicon coat (Provil® novo
Medium; Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Germany) through the CCA
followed by reperfusion. Sham-operated mice underwent the
same surgical procedure without suture insertion.
Measurement of Infarct Volume Brain was stained by
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, U.S.A.) as described previously.14) At 24 h after MCAO,
mice were killed, and their brains were immediately dissected.

RESULTS

DISCUSSION

Changes in Insulin Contents after Cerebral Ischemia
in the Pancreas The infarction area was observed on day
1 after MCAO (Fig. 1A). Insulin content in the pancreas was
signiﬁcantly increased at 6 h (Figs. 1B, C), 12 h (Figs. 1D, E),
and 24 h (Figs. 1F, G) after MCAO.
Changes in NGF in Pancreas after Cerebral Ischemia
Insulin (Fig. 2A), NGF (Fig. 2B), and DAPI (Fig. 2C) were
merged (Fig. 2D) in native mice. At 6 h after MCAO, expression levels of NGF tended to increase as compared with the
sham (Fig. 2E), and at 12 and 24 h, they were signiﬁcantly
increased in the pancreas (Figs. 2F, G).
Changes in TrkA in Pancreas after Cerebral Ischemia
Insulin (Fig. 3A), TrkA (Fig. 3B), and DAPI (Fig. 3C) were
merged (Fig. 3D) in native mice. At 6 h after MCAO, expression levels of TrkA were unchanged (Fig. 3E) but tended to
decrease at 12 h (Fig. 3F). Expression levels of TrkA were
signiﬁcantly decreased in the pancreas 24 h after MCAO (Fig.
3G).

Insulin is important for systemic glucose metabolism, and
cerebral ischemia causes the impairment of insulin function.5,6) In our previous ﬁndings, the administration of intermediate-acting insulin suppressed neuronal damage after cerebral ischemia,6) suggesting that not only the development of
cerebral ischemia-induced insulin resistance alone but also an
insufﬁciency of insulin secretion in response to elevated blood
glucose may lead to hyperglycemia after cerebral ischemia.
In addition, it should be determined whether the “protective
effect” of insulin as a growth factor contributes to the regulation of post-ischemic hyperglycemic conditions.16) For this
reason, it is desirable to investigate the mechanism of insulin
secretion in the pancreas after cerebral ischemia. We have
previously reported that post-ischemic hyperglycemia began
to develop within 6 h after cerebral ischemia and was signiﬁcantly increased at 12 and 24 h.6) In the present study, insulin
contents were clearly increased 6 h after cerebral ischemia and
before blood glucose levels were elevated. Sympathetic nerve
activity is also induced by cerebral ischemia.17,18)

Considering other reports, it is clear that NGF is an important regulator of the synthesis and secretion of insulin by
the pancreas.13) In the present study, NGF was dramatically
increased from 6 to 24 h after cerebral ischemia. In previous studies, the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine
induced the elevation of pancreatic NGF levels, which were
dramatically inhibited by propranolol, a β-adrenergic receptor blocker.13) These results suggested that the activation of
the sympathetic nervous system also increases NGF secretion
from the pancreas,19) i.e., elevated NGF may be responsible for
the cerebral ischemia-induced increase of insulin contents.
NGF is synthesized in β cells and promotes the synthesis
and secretion of NGF by autocrine/paracrine.20) In addition,
expression levels of both NGF and TrkA are regulated by
glucose stimulation.21) NGF/TrkA signaling is involved in insulin secretion under hyperglycemic conditions or diabetes.12)
Thus, the activation of NGF/TrkA signaling may also promote
insulin secretion after cerebral ischemia. In peripheral tissues,
NGF is synthesized and promoted predominantly by the activation of sympathetic nerves.19) However, our ﬁndings showed
that TrkA is decreased 24 h after cerebral ischemia. It may act
via a negative feedback system by a continuous stimulation
of early-elevated NGF. In contrast, the activation of NGF/p75
signaling reduces the expression levels of TrkA.21) The expression level of p75 is increased by hyperglycemic conditions
in rat insulinoma, INS-1E β cells.21) Cerebral ischemia also
induces the expression level of p75 in the brain.22) Thus, it is
possible that TrkA is decreased by the signaling as described
above in hyperglycemia after cerebral ischemia.
In conclusion, the mechanism of increased insulin content
and secretion after cerebral ischemia may be closely associated with the activation of NGF/TrkA signaling. Understanding
of the insulin regulation system following cerebral ischemia
may contribute to the development of a therapy for reducing
the neuronal damage from cerebral ischemia.
