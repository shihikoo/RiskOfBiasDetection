Abstract Inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis
of ischemic stroke. This process depends, in part, upon proinflammatory factors released by activated resident central nervous system (CNS) microglia (MG). Previous studies demonstrated that transfer of IL-10+ B-cells reduced infarct volumes in
male C57BL/6 J recipient mice when given 24 h prior to or
therapeutically at 4 or 24 h after experimental stroke induced
by 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The present study assesses possible sex differences in immunoregulation
by IL-10+ B-cells on primary male vs. female MG cultured from
naïve and ischemic stroke-induced mice. Thus, MG cultures
were treated with recombinant (r)IL-10, rIL-4 or IL-10+ Bcells after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation and evaluated
by flow cytometry for production of proinflammatory and
anti-inflammatory factors. We found that IL-10+ B-cells significantly reduced MG production of TNF-α, IL-1β and CCL3

post-MCAO and increased their expression of the antiinflammatory M2 marker, CD206, by cell-cell interactions.
Moreover, MG from female vs. male mice had higher expression of IL-4 and IL-10 receptors and increased production of IL4, especially after treatment with IL-10+ B-cells. These findings
indicate that IL-10-producing B-cells play a crucial role in regulating MG activation, proinflammatory cytokine release and
M2 phenotype induction, post-MCAO, with heightened sensitivity of female MG to IL-4 and IL-10. This study, coupled with
our previous demonstration of increased numbers of transferred
IL-10+ B-cells in the ischemic hemisphere, provide a mechanistic basis for local regulation by secreted IL-10 and IL-4 as well
as direct B-cell/MG interactions that promote M2-MG.

Stroke still remains the fourth leading cause of death and one
of the major causes of disability in the United States, affecting

5

1516

7 million people (Onwuekwe and Ezeala-Adikaibe 2012;
Towfighi and Saver 2011). Ischemic stroke constitutes 87 %
of all strokes and is caused by the occlusion of a blood vessel.
Inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke and other forms of ischemic brain injuries. Key
features of this neuroinflammatory reaction are the invasion
of peripheral immune cells across the damaged blood–brain
barrier (BBB), the activation of resident innate immune cells
(microglia) and the production of inflammatory humoral mediators such as cytokines and chemokines (Ladecola and
Anrather 2011). Although the cells of the innate immune system, especially neutrophils and monocytes, remain one focus,
recent studies have demonstrated that the resident microglia
are also one of the critical players in controlling the course of
inflammation and/or generating anti-inflammatory/repair in
the ischemic regions of the brain after injury (Taylor and
Sansing 2013).
Microglia (MG) are the resident immune cells of the central
nervous system (CNS). Microglia and activated macrophages
recruited from the periphery are rapidly mobilized to the site
of injury and represent the first line of defense against brain
injuries such as stroke. These cells release effector molecules
and recruit other immune cells (Kissela et al. 2009), but may
have opposing functions with respect to neurological recovery
(Patel et al. 2013). On one hand, activated MG and macrophages promote brain recovery by clearing cell debris, resolving local inflammation and releasing trophic factors (Hanisch
and Kettenmann 2007; Kwon et al. 2013; Miron et al. 2013;
Thored et al. 2009). On the other, these cells can hinder CNS
repair and expand tissue damage (Ekdahl et al. 2003; Liu et al.
2007; Miron et al. 2013). The role of microglia/macrophages
in ischemic brain injury, however, is still unclear. A number of
studies contend that microglia/macrophages are highly plastic
cells that can assume diverse phenotypes and engage different
functional programs in response to specific microenvironmental signals (Chu et al. 2012; Hu et al. 2015; Sozmen et al.
2009). In particular, in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) promotes the differentiation of
Bclassically activated^ M1 microglia/macrophages that typically leads to release of destructive pro-inflammatory mediators (Rosenzweig and Carmichael 2013). In contrast, interleukin (IL)-4 (Pepe et al. 2014; Xiong et al. 2011) and IL-10
induce an Balternatively activated^ M2 phenotype that possesses neuroprotective properties (Chu et al. 2012; Jalal
et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2013). Typically, the damaged tissue
environment in vivo immediately after stroke attracts neutrophils and promotes an M1 phenotype (Hu et al. 2012), including M1 microglia and recruited peripheral macrophages, that
increase inflammation and cell death beyond the initial ischemic infarct (Denker et al. 2007; Schilling et al. 2005).
However, anti-inflammatory signals such as IL-4 or IL-10
are also triggered that may ameliorate tissue damage (Hu
et al. 2012), enhance M2 responses and reduce cognitive

Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:1515–1529

impairment following cerebral ischemia (Cherry et al. 2014;
Perez-de Puig et al. 2013; Xiong et al. 2011). The dual roles of
distinctly polarized macrophage populations have been reported in several CNS diseases, including multiple sclerosis
(Miron et al. 2013) and spinal cord injury (Chu et al. 2012).
The concept of microglial M1 and M2 phenotypes is also
being addressed in the field of stroke research (Butovsky
et al. 2006b). However, a comprehensive characterization of
microglia/macrophage polarization after ischemic brain injury
is still missing.
The severity of ischemic damage is influenced by sex, but
few stroke laboratories study female animals or use cell
models of ischemic brain injury that are sex-specific. In part,
this is due to the historical assumption that cellular/molecular
injury and repair mechanisms are the same in males vs. females. The persistent lack of pre-clinical animal data in both
sexes poses a severe evidence gap for clinical trials that will
test new therapies in males and females. It is now clear that
males and females respond to stroke differently. Females have
a lower incidence of stroke and are relatively protected from
immediate responses to ischemia compared to males (Alkayed
et al. 1998; Murphy et al. 2004; Sudlow and Warlow 1997).
The underlying molecular and inflammatory mechanisms that
lead to stroke-induced sex discrepancy have not been extensively studied.
Our laboratory’s long-term goal in designing stroke therapies has been to not only determine the critical detrimental
factors but also to understand how the protective immunological cells act in acute stroke. Over the past few years we have
convincingly demonstrated the protective role of a small subpopulation of B cells, called regulatory B cells (Bregs), that
have the capacity to produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine
IL-10. The immunoregulatory role of IL-10+ B cells (Bregs)
was clearly demonstrated by a significant reduction in the
infarct size in not only B-cell-deficient (μMT-/- ) mice
(Bodhankar et al. 2013) but also in B-cell-sufficient mice
(Bodhankar et al. 2014b). IL-10-rich B-cells were efficient
in limiting infarct volumes when given prophylactically
(24 h before) or therapeutically (4 h after and as late as 24 h
after) MCAO-induction (Bodhankar et al. 2014a, b). The primary purpose of the present study was to determine whether
IL-10-rich B-cells can elicit immunoregulation in both male
and female mice and also whether there are any sex differences upon treating MG, obtained from ischemic strokeinduced mice. Our results clearly demonstrate that treatment
with IL-10+ B-cells significantly ameliorated proinflammatory responses generated in microglia post-MCAO in both
sexes. The dampening of proinflammatory responses by the
Bregs was more evident in the female mice as compared to the
males. Moreover, the IL-10+ B-cells could not only dampen
the proinflammatory status of the microglia, but also elicit an
anti-inflammatory M2 MG phenotype. Our studies are the first
to demonstrate that while the proinflammatory milieu in the

Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:1515–1529

microglia could be dampened by soluble factors secreted by
the Bregs, the induction of M2 phenotype was a result of cellto-cell interaction with the Bregs.

Materials and methods
Animals
Ten to twelve week old wild type C57BL/6 J (WT) male and
female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar
Harbor, ME, USA). Naïve WT male mice were housed at the
VA Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS), and mice
that were used for transient focal cerebral ischemia were
housed at the Oregon Health & Science University Animal
Resource Facility. Age and sex matched B6(Cg)Il10tm1.1Karp/J (IL-10GFP) mice, used as donors of IL-10+ B
cells, were obtained from the in-house breeding colony in the
Animal Resource Facility at the VAPORHCS, consistent with
institutional guidelines. This strain has been previously described (Bodhankar et al. 2014b; Madan et al. 2009). In brief,
the sequence for enhanced green fluorescent fusion protein
(eGFP) has been inserted into the non-coding region of Il10
on a C57BL/6 J background, leading to co-expression of
eGFP and IL-10. All animals were housed under pathogenfree conditions with ad libitum access to food and water.
Procedures were performed in accordance with the National
Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care & Use of
Laboratory Animals and both VAPORHCS and Oregon
Health & Science University Animal Care and Use
Committees approved all protocols.
Primary CNS culture and purification of microglia
Tissue culture and enrichment for microglia Mice were
deeply anesthetized using 4 % isoflurane inhaled anesthetic
and maintained at 2.5 % isoflurane during intracardiac perfusion with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Fisher
Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA). Brains were removed aseptically, olfactory bulbs and brain stem were removed and the
remaining tissue washed twice in cold Hank’s balanced salt
solution lacking Mg2+, Ca2+ and phenol red (HBSS, Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA).
A unicellular suspension of CNS tissue was obtained using the
protocol and reagents supplied in the Neural Tissue
Dissociation Kit P from Miltenyi Biotec (Auburn, CA,
USA) with few modifications (Moussaud and Draheim
2010). Briefly, tissues were disrupted mechanically on a
gentleMACS tissue dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) and incubated with the enzyme cocktails included with the kit. Following
trituration using a P1000 pipette, the homogenate was passed

1517

through a 100 μm nylon mesh screen (Fisher Scientific) and
washed in HBSS to quell enzymatic activity.
After disaggregation, total brain cells were prepared for
culture based on a published method (Moussaud and
Draheim 2010). Myelin was removed by density centrifugation in 20 % Percoll (GE Healthcare, Pittsburg, PA, USA),
overlayed with cold HBSS for 20 min at 200×g with no brake
and then washed once in cold HBSS. Pelleted cells were resuspended in warmed Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/
Nutrient Mixture F-12 with Glutamax supplement (DMEM,
Life Technologies) culture medium completed with 10 % heat
inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, GE Healthcare), 1 %
antibiotic-antimycotic (anti-anti, Life Technologies), and
5 ng/mL carrier-free recombinant mouse granulocyte macroph ag e col on y-s timul atin g f ac tor (GM- CSF, Lif e
Technologies) and counted. 1.3×106 cells were seeded into
tissue culture grade poly L-lysine (L-lysine, Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) coated T75 cell culture treated flasks
(Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA) and placed in
a 37 °C incubator with 5 % CO2 and 85 % relative humidity.
Culture supernatant was replaced twice weekly with 10 mL
fresh completed medium until confluency of cells was observed, at approximately 3 weeks.
Harvest of microglia from enriched cultures Upon confluence, loosely adherent cells were dislodged from culture flasks
by agitation using an orbital shaker (Benchmark, Edison, NJ,
USA). Flasks were shaken at 280 revolutions per minute for
4 h and supernatants were harvested and centrifuged. Before
the start of the in vitro co-culture experiments, cells were
resuspended in culture medium free of GM-CSF, counted,
and seeded into 24 well plates at a density of 2×105 cells
per well and incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 for 5 days prior
to assay. Remaining cells were checked for purity and their
p h e n o t y p e w a s d e t e r m i n e d b y f l o w c y t o m e t r y.
CD11b+CD45+ microglia comprised ≥96 % of cells harvested
in this manner.
B-cell isolation and IL-10 enrichment
Splenocytes from IL-10-GFP reporter male and female mice
were collected as described in (Bodhankar et al. 2014a).
Splenic CD19+ B-cells were purified using paramagnetic
bead-conjugated antibodies (Abs) from the CD19 cell isolation kit and subsequently separated by AutoMACS (Miltenyi
Biotec, Auburn, CA). The negative fraction of the cells thus
separated were CD19+ B-cells with a purity of≥95 %. CD19+
B-cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech,
Manassas, VA, USA) supplemented with 2 % Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS), 57.2 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (BME, SigmaAldrich), 1 % L-glutamate (Life Technologies), 1 % sodium
pyruvate (Life Technologies), and cultured in the presence of
1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS, E. coli strain K12). After

1518

48 h of culture, B-cells were harvested from culture plates,
washed free of LPS and counted in 0.2 % trypan blue (Life
Technologies) in a cell counter (Nexcelom Bioscience,
Lawrence, MA, USA), washed, and resuspended in DMEM
culture medium without GM-CSF for co-culture with
microglia.
B cell: microglia co-culture
Co-culture setup On the day of co-culture, the medium in 24
well plates was replaced with 1 mL fresh culture medium or
medium containing 10 ng/mL LPS (Sigma-Aldrich). After
4 h, supernatants were discarded and one of the following
treatments was given in 1 mL of fresh culture medium: no
treatment, 20 ng recombinant IL-10 (rIL-10, Peprotech,
Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), 20 ng recombinant IL-4 (rIL-4,
Peprotech), B cells at a ratio of 1:1 with microglia, B cells at
a ratio of 1:2 with microglia. The MG cells were incubated
with mentioned treatment at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 for 24 h.
Examination of contact independent interactions Co-cultures were set up as above, but B cells (at a 1:1 ratio) were
separated from microglia by polyethylene terephthalate hanging cell culture inserts with a pore size of 1 μm (EMD
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). This size of pore was chosen
to preclude direct contact between these populations while
allowing the diffusion of secreted factors.
Analysis of cell populations by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS)
Antibodies All antibodies were purchased from BD
Biosciences unless otherwise noted. Clones are indicated in
parentheses. To determine microglia phenotype: anti-CD11b
FITC (M1/70), anti-CD11b PerCPCy5.5 (M1/70), CD11c
PECy7 (HL3), anti-CD45 APC (30-F11), anti-CD45 FITC
(30-F11), anti-CD124 AlexaFluor 647 (mIL4R-M1), antiCD210 PE (1B1.3a), anti-F4/80 PE (T45-2342), anti-I-Ab
PE (AF6-120.1), anti-Ly-6G PE (1A8) were used. For staining
of intracellular cytokines/chemokines: anti-CCL3 PE
(DNT3CC, eBioscience), anti-CD206 APC (C068C2,
Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-IL-1β APC
(NJTEN3, eBioscience), anti-IL-4 PE (11B11), anti-IL-10
APC (JES5-16E3) and anti-TNF PE (MP6-XT22) were used.
Extracellular staining Single cell suspensions were washed
with staining buffer (PBS with 0.1 % NaN3 (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 0.5 % bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich)). Fc
receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/32 antibody (2.4G2,
BD Biosciences) and cells were incubated with monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) listed above. Unbound mAbs were washed
away with staining buffer prior to four-color fluorescence flow

cytometry analysis using a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
Intracellular staining Cells to be analyzed for intracellular
cytokine production by flow cytometry received 1 μL
GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) protein
transport inhibitor 4 h prior to immunostaining. Cells were
fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA, eBioscience) after extracellular stains were applied as above, then permeabilized in
Permabilization/Wash buffer (Perm/Wash, BD Biosciences).
mAbs against intracellular targets were incubated with cells in
Perm/Wash, unbound mAbs were eluted and cells were resuspended in staining buffer for acquisition. Isotype matched
mAb served as negative controls to demonstrate specificity.
All data were acquired and analyzed using the Accuri C6
software included with the instrument.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male and
female WT mice for 1 h by reversible right MCAO under
isoflurane anesthesia followed by 96 h of reperfusion as previously described (Bodhankar et al. 2014b). The individual
performing all MCAO surgeries was blinded to treatment
group. Head and body temperature were controlled at 36.5±
1.0 °C during surgery, MCAO, and early reperfusion with
warm water pads and a heating lamp. The common carotid
artery was exposed and the external carotid artery was ligated
and cauterized. Unilateral MCAO was accomplished by
inserting a 6-0 nylon monofilament surgical suture
(ETHICON, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) with a heat-rounded
and silicone-coated (Xantopren comfort light, Heraeus,
Germany) tip into the internal carotid artery via the external
carotid artery stump. Adequacy of MCAO was confirmed by
monitoring cortical blood flow at the onset of the occlusion
with a Laser Doppler Flowmetry (LDF) probe (Model DRT4,
Moor Instruments, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) affixed to the
skull. Animals were excluded if mean intra-ischemic LDF was
greater than 30 % pre-ischemic baseline (Bodhankar et al.
2013). At 1 h of occlusion, the occluding filament was withdrawn to allow for reperfusion and the incision was closed
with 6–0 surgical sutures (ETHICON, Inc., Somerville, NJ,
USA). Each mouse was then awakened and recovered in a
separate cage with a warm water pad.
RNA isolation and reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction
Total RNA was isolated from MG subject to the treatments
indicated above using the RNeasy mini kit protocol (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) and converted into cDNA using oligo-dT
primers and Superscript RT II (Life Technologies).
Quantitative real time PCR was performed on a

Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:1515–1529

1519

StepOnePlus Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) using the TaqMan Gene Expression
Assays in Taqman Universal Master Mix (all Applied
Biosystems) that included primers for Cd80 and Cx3xr1.
ΔCt was calculated against the expression of the endogenous
control GAPDH. Fold change in targeted transcript expression
was determined using the formula 2-ΔΔCt.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance for data obtained by flow cytometry
analysis for yields and purity of cultured microglia was analyzed by Student’s t-test. Statistical significance for differences
in cytokine/chemokine production after MG treatments were
analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by a post hoc Dunnett’s Multiple comparison test where values
were compared to the LPS treatment. Statistical significance for
difference between sexes was determined by two-way ANOVA
followed by the post-hoc Bonferroni multiple comparison test.
The criterion for statistical significance was p≤0.05. All values
are reported as mean±SEM. Significant differences are denoted
as *p≤0.05; **p≤0.01; ***p≤0.001 for differences in treatments within each sex and #p≤0.05; ##p≤0.01 for differences
in treatments between the sexes.

Results
Yield and purity of primary microglia cultures isolated
from adult naïve mice
Studies were initiated in naïve WT male mice to optimize the
conditions of MG isolation from adult mice. MG were isolated
from the brains of naïve male 11–12 week old adult mice. Prior
to seeding for mixed neuron/glia culture (days in vitro (div) 0),
the number of cells yielded was calculated and the
CD11b+CD45+ fraction was determined by flow cytometry.
The glial cell culture was incubated at 370C at 5 % CO2 and
replenished with fresh medium containing GM-CSF every
3 days. On day 21 of culture (21 div), the MG phenotype was
re-characterized by flow cytometry. At 21 div, a conspicuous
and significant rise was observed in the number of cells yielded
per flask compared to the number of cells initially retrieved per
brain (Fig. 1a). These cells were overwhelmingly doublepositive for the microglia/monocyte markers CD11b and
CD45 (>96 %), indicating substantial, statistically significant
enrichment of the MG population (Fig. 1b). Further analyses
indicated that the percent of CD11b+CD45lo (resting MG) from
day of seeding to day 21 div, went from 20 to 93.2 % with only
4.5 % of the MG being the CD11b+CD45high (activated microglia/monocytes) population (data not shown). Upon further
phenotype characterization, the purified MG expressed the
classic MG marker, F4/80 (98.3 %). The MG also expressed

minimal MHCII molecules, suggesting that they had an
antigen-presenting capacity. They also had minimal expression
of Gr-1, an inflammatory marker on monocytes (1.3 %) and
CD11c (5.8 %), an antigen-presenting cell-phenotype acquired
when microglia become activated (data not shown). Thus, we
could successfully establish primary MG cultures resulting in
increased yields and purity from the day of their isolation up
until the day of harvest (21 div) for further co-culture studies.
Effects of rIL-10 and B cells on microglial activation
One of the best known consequences of MG activation is their
release of toxic factors, including TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, a variety of reactive oxygen species and prostanoids (Ransohoff
and Brown 2012). It is not fully known whether MG activation
is detrimental to the adjoining injured neuron. However, it is
well recognized that blocking MG activation confers neuroprotection in vivo and in vitro (Lalancette-Hebert et al. 2007). Our
goal was to determine the concentration of recombinant
interleukin-10 (rIL-10) needed to inhibit activation of MG
and determine if secreted levels of IL-10 produced by the IL10+ B cells was sufficient to inhibit MG activation. Studies
were initiated in naïve WT male mice to optimize the conditions of MG isolation from adults. After phenotyping the primary MG cultures (demonstrated in Fig. 1), MG were activated
such that they secreted proinflammatory factors. For activation,
cultured primary adult MG (2×104 cells/well in a 24-well plate)
were incubated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 4 h. After activation,
LPS was washed off and MG were treated with 20 ng/ml IL-10

1520

or IL-10+ GFP+ B-cells (in a 1:1 or 1:2 B:MG ratio) or vehicle.
The frequencies of MG producing TNF-α were determined by
flow cytometry 24 h later. Our results demonstrate that 20 ng
rIL-10 was able to significantly reduce the TNF-α levels (from
~14.7 % TNF-α+ LPS-treated MG to ~7.8 %). Also, the TNF-α
levels were significantly reduced when IL-10+ B-cells were
added at a 1:1 ratio (6.8 % TNF-α) (Fig. 2a). A ratio of 1:2
IL-10+ B cells:MG was also tested in an attempt to titrate the
capacity of IL-10+ B cells to control inflammation and surprisingly could reduce the production of TNF-α levels to 7.8 %.
Using the same experimental set-up, we also tested the
ability of both rIL-10 and IL-10+ B cells to control the production of other pro-inflammatory parameters i.e., IL-1β and
the chemokine CCL3 (MIP-1α). rIL-10 and B cells (in a 1:1
ratio) significantly reduced IL-1β production in MG isolated
from naïve male mice (Fig. 2b) (from 13.1 to 7.45 % with rIL10 and 7.4 % with B1:1 treatments). However this reduction
was not significant when IL-10+ B cells were used at a 1:2
ratio (8.6 % IL-1β production) relative to the MG. Similarly a
remarkable reduction in CCL3 levels was observed when
LPS-stimulated MG were cultured either with rIL-10 or B
cells (both at 1:1 and 1:2 ratios) (Fig. 2c). CCL3 levels went
from 14.12 to 7 % for rIL-10, 4.8 % for B cell (1:1) and 8.2 %
for B cell (1:2) treatments. Thus, primary MG obtained from
naïve WT male mice responded to LPS stimulation to produce
large quantities of pro-inflammatory mediators, which could
be reduced to almost basal levels (Med), upon treatment with
not only rIL-10 but more importantly also with IL-10enriched B cells. These results provided a reliable approach
for testing the efficacy of IL-10+ B cells in dampening the
proinflammatory status of microglia, post-MCAO.

Fig. 2 Effects of rIL-10 and B cells on microglial activation. Primary
MG, isolated and cultured from naïve WT male mice, were harvested
after 21 days in vitro (at confluency) and cultured in GM-CSF-free medium for 5 days. MG were stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 4 h. Supernatants were discarded after 4 h and one of the following treatments was
given in 1 mL of fresh culture medium: no treatment, 20 ng recombinant
IL-10 (rIL-10), IL-10+ B cells at a 1:1 ratio or at a 1:2 ratio with MG. The
MG cells were incubated with mentioned treatments at 37 °C and 5 %
CO2 for 24 h and proinflammatory cytokines A. TNF-α and B. IL-β and

Enhanced dampening of proinflammatory status
of microglia from female mice in response to treatment
with IL-10+ B cells, post-MCAO
After having tested and optimized our co-culture system using
naïve MG, we further extended our studies to test the effects of
the IL-10-enriched B cells on MG obtained not only from
MCAO male mice, but also to those isolated from female
mice, in an attempt to discern sex differences in immunoregulation. Age-matched male and female WT mice were subjected to 60 min MCAO followed by 96 h of reperfusion. MG
were isolated from brains of these male and female mice after
96 h of reperfusion, seeded in tissue culture flasks and after 21
div, harvested to be co-cultured with rIL-10 and B cells as
described above. Similar to naïve mice, the yield and purity
of MG after 21 days in vitro significantly increased in both
male and female mice (Fig. 3a and b). The MG from MCAO
mice proliferated much better than the MG from naïve mice
and the overall yields after 21 div were higher those obtained
from naïve mice (~3.3 million for male and 3.1 million for
female MG, post-MCAO as compared to 1.5 million for naïve
male MG) (Fig. 3a), while the purity (CD11b+CD45+) went
from 18.4 to 94.4 % for male MG and 23.6 to 96.2 % for
female MG (Fig. 3b). Due to culture conditions and the presence of GM-CSF in the culture medium, the majority of the
MG obtained from stroke-afflicted mice attained a resting MG
phenotype (CD11b+CD45lo). However, there was still the
presence of activated microglia/infiltrated monocytes in the
culture at 21 div (Fig. 3c and d). Further analysis of the MG
demonstrated that the overall activated state of the MG from

(Fig. 3c and d).
MG obtained from MCAO mice were further stimulated with
LPS for 4 h, with the no treatment group serving as the negative
control. The MCAO-MG were treated with 20 ng/ml rIL-10 and
B cells at a 1:1 ratio (B cells:microglia) and pro-inflammatory
cytokines, TNF-α, IL-1β and CCL3, were determined by flow
cytometry after 24 h of treatment. As indicated in Fig. 4a, b and c,
treatment of LPS activated male and female MG after MCAO
with rIL-10 and B cells (1:1) significantly inhibited TNF-α IL1β and CCL3/MIP-1α production to baseline levels, although
baselines for IL-1β and CCL3 were lower for females than
males. For TNF-α levels went from 18.4 % in the LPS-treated
to 12 % after rIL-10 and to 12.5 % after B cell (1:1) treatment in

male MG and from 17.2 % in LPS-treated to 9.4 % after rIL-10
and to 9.3 % after B cell (1:1) treatment in female MG (Fig. 4a).
There was a similar pattern of inhibition for IL-1β (Fig. 4b) and
CCL3/MIP-1α (Fig. 4c). Overall, the cytokine levels produced
by male MG after MCAO were higher than that produced by
naïve male MG (naïve female MG were not tested).
To further assess additional M1 markers, mRNA was isolated
from the MG treated with IL-10+ B cells (1:1) and the positive
control, rIL-10, for 24 h of co-culture. Real time PCR was performed to determine the gene expression levels of the classic M1
markers, namely cd80 and cx3cr1. As expected, the MG treated
with IL-10+ B cells demonstrated a significantly lower expression of the gene cd80 as compared to the medium control both in
male and female mice (Fig. 4d). However, the expression of cd80

multiple comparison test #p≤0.05 and ##p≤0.01, as compared to the
respective treatment in male microglia

in female MG was much lower than in males (Fig. 4d). Similarly,
the relative expression of another M1 marker, cx3cr1, was significantly down regulated in the MG treated with rIL-10 and IL10-enriched B cells with no difference in the level of expression
between the B cell-treated male and female MG (Fig. 4e). Thus,
overall these results indicate that the increase in M1 phenotype,
particularly cd80, attained by MG post-MCAO, could be efficiently ameliorated by the IL-10+ B cell treatment more efficiently in female than male MG.

milieu in MG, we tested the expression of CD206 on MG
obtained from MCAO-induced male and female mice after
24 h of co-culture with Bregs. Since the production of
CD206 in MG is induced in the presence of IL-4 in the milieu
(Stein et al. 1992), rIL-4 (20 ng/ml) was used as a positive
control. As indicated in Fig. 5, there was a marked increase in
expression of CD206 compared to baseline (4–7 %) in the
presence of rIL-4 (20.95 % in male MG and 17.4 % in female
MG) and rIL-10 (13.7 % in male MG and 20.8 % in female
MG). IL-10+ B cells (in a 1:1 ratio) could significantly upregulate CD206 expression both in the male (11.9 %) and female
(11 %) MG, post-MCAO. While the B cells when used in half
the amount (i.e., 1:2 ratio) were still capable of upregulating
the CD206 vs. the medium control, this change was not significantly lower compared to the LPS-stimulated condition.

in microglia, post-MCAO. Primary MG, isolated and cultured from
MCAO-treated WT male and female mice, were harvested after 21 days
in vitro (at confluency) and cultured in GM-CSF-free medium for 5 days.
MG were stimulated with 10 ng/ml LPS for 4 h. Supernatants were
discarded after 4 h and one of the following treatments was given in
1 mL of fresh culture medium: no treatment, 20 ng recombinant IL-10
(rIL-10), 20 ng/ml rIL-4 or IL-10+ B cells at a 1:1 ratio with MG. The MG
cells were incubated with mentioned treatments at 37 °C and 5 % CO2 for
24 h and the M2 marker, CD0206 was determined by flow cytometry.
Values are given as mean±S.E.M. Data presented are representative of

between the two sexes were performed by two-way ANOVA followed by
the post-hoc Bonferroni multiple comparison test, with #p≤0.05 as compared to the respective treatment in male MG

for each treatment condition were compared. There was no
difference in the expression of CD206 when treated with IL10-enriched B cells, between male and female MG, postMCAO, except for a significantly higher efficiency of rIL-4
to induce CD206 in the females as compared to their male
counter-parts with similar treatment (Fig. 5). More importantly, treatment of MCAO-MG with Bregs resulted in a significantly higher induction of CD206 as compared to the no treatment condition (basal levels of expression). Thus, these results
convincingly demonstrate that Bregs could induce an M2 phenotype in MCAO-affected MG.

In lieu of the above results wherein Bregs could induce M2
phenotype in the MG, we assessed the presence of IL-4 and
IL-10 receptors on the microglia, in the same culture condition

1523

settings as described in Fig. 5. CD206 was induced in presence of IL-4 and IL-10, hence the IL-4 and IL-10 receptors are
pertinent to be present on MG in order to respond to the
positive stimuli. We have consistently demonstrated over the
past few studies that the Bregs can ameliorate the proinflammatory milieu in the ischemic hemispheres of male
mice, and that this decrease in the proinflammatory status
was attributed to the enhanced IL-10 producing capacity of
the B cells. So, we first sought to assess the expression levels
of IL-10R on the microglia in an attempt to answer whether
the Bregs regulate MG via this receptor. Surprisingly, the MG
obtained from male mice post-MCAO had lower levels of IL10R expression in response to rIL-10 (3.9 % from 7.6 % at
basal levels). This was also true but to a lesser extent in the
presence of Bregs (5.8 %). However, in the female MG, while
the treatment with rIL-10 resulted in a minor increase (10.2 %
from 9.8 % from basal levels), the Breg treatment could induce a much higher expression of IL-10R (12.1 %). The female MG demonstrated a significant expression of IL-10R
both in response to the positive control i.e., rIL-10 and also
upon treatment with IL-10-enriched B cells as compared to its
male counterparts (Fig. 6a and b). Similarly, while there was
an upregulation in the expression of IL-4Rα on the MCAOsubjected MG of male mice in the presence of rIL-4 (17.6 %
from 11 %) and Bregs (14.6 %), it was the MG obtained from
MCAO females that demonstrated the greatest increase in the
expression of the IL-4R, not only in response to rIL-4 (32 %)
but more importantly in the presence of Bregs (24.5 %)
(Fig. 6c and d) and this was significantly higher when compared to male MG. Thus, MG obtained from female mice
demonstrated a higher expression of both IL-10 and IL-4 receptors, indicating a better ability to respond to the respective
anti-inflammatory factors.
Treatment with IL-10+ B cells leads to increased IL-4
production by female microglia post-MCAO
MG are known to produce the anti-inflammatory cytokines
when modulated by the right kind of precursors and are
known to control their own polarization through autocrine
and paracrine means (Cherry et al. 2014). Hence, we determined the inherent production of IL-4 and IL-10 by the microglia from male and female MG, post-MCAO in presence of
the relevant positive controls and Bregs (Fig. 7a and b). Both
male and female MG exhibited upregulated IL-4 and IL-10
production in the presence of the corresponding positive inducers, and to some extent also in the presence of Bregs.
However, very interesting phenotypic characteristics were observed when the IL-4 and IL-10 production were compared
between the two sexes. While the female MG produced robust
amounts of IL-4 in the presence of Bregs (22.9 %) as compared to the male counterparts (8.6 %) (Fig. 7a), the male MG
could produce significantly higher levels of IL-10 (17.4 %) as

followed by the post-hoc Bonferroni multiple comparison test, with
#p≤0.05 as compared to the respective treatment in male MG

compared to the females (5.5 %), when treated with Bregs
(Fig. 7b). Interestingly, the CD11b−CD45+ population (presumable the B cells) was also found to have a capacity to
produce significantly higher levels of IL-4 when co-cultured
with female post-MCAO MG (data not shown). These results
suggest that very distinct differences in the autocrine production of anti-inflammatory factors exists between the two sexes.

The presence of B cells in the Transwell resulted in a marked but
insignificant reduction of TNFα production in the male MG
(9.5 % from 13.5 %) and as well with the female MG, but there
was no difference in the TNFα production when the regulatory B
cells were in the Transwell (17 %) as opposed to direct contact
(16.2 %) with MG (Fig. 8a). Interestingly, the expression of the
M2 marker, CD206, was significantly reduced both in the males
(10.5 % from 13.8 %) and females (6.7 % from 10.2 %) when B
cells were present in Transwells (Fig. 8b), indicating the need for
cell-to-cell contact. Since our preliminary results had indicated
that B cells (CD11b−CD45+ cells) co-cultured with the MG were
able to produce IL-4, we assessed the IL-4 production in Bregs
obtained from the IL-10GFP reporter donors. These B cells were
not able to produce IL-4 prior to being co-cultured with the MG,
but produced more IL-4 when in direct contact with MG (9.6 %)
than when present in Transwells (8.2 %, Fig. 8c). In contrast,
these Bregs produced equivalent amounts of IL-10 both when in
contact and/or in Transwells with MG (Fig. 8d). Thus, the B cells

applied into the Transwell chamber. After 24 h, the M1 cytokine
(TNFα) and M2 marker (CD206) were determined in the MG.

acquired an enhanced ability to produce IL-4 only when in cellto-cell contact with MG. These results suggest that in both male
and female MG, the M1 phenotype in ischemic MG was
inhibited via soluble factors, including IL-10 secreted by the
regulatory B cells, while augmentation of the M2 phenotype
involved cell-to-cell contact with the Bregs and IL-4 production.

Discussion
Reperfusion of the brain after ischemic stroke is known to lead
to infiltration of peripheral leukocytes into the area of brain
injury that secrete proinflammatory cytokines, eventually
causing secondary injury (Onwuekwe and Ezeala-Adikaibe
2012). As resident immune cells in the CNS, microglia are
also known to both phagocytose debris and secrete proinflammatory cytokines under ischemic conditions, contributing to
the tissue damage (Gregersen et al. 2000). However, the MG
may also secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10
and TGF-β (de Bilbao et al. 2009; Lehrmann et al. 1998;
Parada et al. 2013) that are known to quench inflammation.
In studies where MG were ablated, mice had larger infarcts
and a doubling of apoptotic neurons after ischemia, indicating

that on balance the MG are needed to alleviate injury after
ischemic stroke (Lalancette-Hebert et al. 2012). One would
surmise that the deleterious vs. the beneficial processes might
depend on the location of the microglia, the degree of ischemia and the timing after injury. Clearly, a better understanding
of the role of MG in post-ischemic injury is needed to further
our knowledge and to devise more effective therapies for
stroke.
Our primary goal in the current study was to determine
whether the regulatory B cells can influence post-stroke MG
and to test their efficacy in dampening MG activation.

1526

Historically, MG cell lines or primary MG isolated from embryonic (Gingras et al. 2007) or neo-natal animals (Floden and
Combs 2007; Giulian and Baker 1986) have been used as
in vitro MG models. However, knowing that the MG cell lines
are not a perfect model (Horvath et al. 2008), the embryonic
and neo-natal primary MG are not completely mature
(Draheim et al. 1999) and that they behave differently than
adult MG (Sierra et al. 2007), we optimized the MG isolation
and culture procedures from adult mouse brains with the eventual goal to culture MG from MCAO-treated mice. The primary MG isolation and culture procedures used in our study
were as described in (Moussaud and Draheim 2010), albeit
with a few modifications to enhance their ability to dampen
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
Our results demonstrate that the MG from naïve mice, upon
LPS-stimulation, produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the production of which was dampened both in the
presence of rIL-10 and Bregs. LPS stimulation of MG was
used to mimic the cascade of inflammatory events after ischemic stroke. Similarly, when the MG isolated from ischemic
mice were subjected to rIL-10 and Breg treatments, a significant reduction in proinflammatory factors was demonstrated.
MG are known to recognize harmful stimuli and respond by
producing inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-6, IL1β, interferon-γ (IFNγ), and several chemokines (Boche et al.
2013). This constellation of cytokines is essential for the polarization of MG into what has been termed a classically activated, ‘M1’, state (Mills et al. 2000). Hence, some of the
proinflammatory factors tested included TNF-α, IL-1β and
the chemokine CCL3 (MIP-1α), all of which are well recognized as primary effector molecules in acute response to ischemic injury. The pleiotropic cytokine, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF-α), is known to play an important role in the regulation
of cell survival and inflammation in the injured and diseased
CNS (Hallenbeck 2002; Owens et al. 2001). In humans,
TNF-α is present at elevated levels and is believed to be implicated in the pathogenesis of stroke (Zaremba and Losy
2001). IL-1β is also a major neuroinflammatory molecule
(Allan et al. 2005) that mediates several key physiological
and behavioral changes associated with sickness (Kelley
et al. 2003) and is known to be regulated by IL-10 (Heyen
et al. 2000; Pousset et al. 1999). When the efficacy of the
Bregs to dampen classical M1 markers was tested, we found
that the mRNA levels of CD80 and the chemokine CX3CR1
produced by the MG were significantly reduced in the B celltreated co-culture conditions. The chemokine receptor
CX3CR1 is expressed at high levels on murine microglia under homeostatic conditions. Mice genetically deficient for
CX3CR1 have smaller infarct volumes after MCAO (Denes
et al. 2008; Fumagalli et al. 2013), hence suggesting its relevance as an inflammatory mediator. Thus, our results convincingly demonstrated that Bregs were efficient in alleviating the
overall proinflammatory status of the activated MG, post-

Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:1515–1529

MCAO. This effect was more pronounced in the females as
compared to the males (Fig. 4a–e). Ex vivo, MG derived from
male and female brains have shown divergent inflammatory
signaling responses to LPS and estradiol treatment (Loram
et al. 2012), which argues that sex differences in MG in the
brain may be more extensive than just a difference in number
or morphology, but may also be phenotypically distinct. With
the emerging importance of immune system mediators in normal brain development, we now know that the role of MG is
far more complex and at times subtle yet profoundly important
(Lenz and McCarthy 2015). In general, our results demonstrated that the MG from the MCAO female mice had a lower
inflammatory status than males, in accordance with our previous studies (Banerjee et al. 2013), but the fact that the regulatory B cells could further alleviate the proinflammatory milieu
seems promising.
CD206 is a mannose receptor belonging to the ‘M2a’ family of classic M2 markers expressed by MG, with its main
function being suppression of inflammation (Stein et al.
1992). It is now known that at 24 h after MCAO, CD206 is
exclusively found in the ischemic core (Perego et al. 2011). In
accordance, another study examining the location of M1 versus M2 microglia/macrophages confirmed the M2 microglia/
macrophages infiltrating the ischemic core at 24 h, peaking at
5 days, and declining in the striatum by 14 days (Hu et al.
2012). The expression of CD206+ cells in the cortex at the
border zone of ischemia peaked at day 5 after ischemia before
being outnumbered by M1 cells (Hu et al. 2012). Hence, the
appearance of CD206 suggests that the microglia/
macrophages in the ischemic core promote tissue repair. The
importance of the M2 phenotype acquired by the microglia,
post-injury, has also been emphasized in other CNS diseases
like EAE, wherein M2 microglia and macrophages were demonstrated to drive oligodendrocyte differentiation during CNS
remyelination (Miron et al. 2013). Our findings corroborate
these studies in that the treatment with Bregs could significantly induce an M2 phenotype in the ischemic MG, both in
males and females. Thus, we can speculate that treatment with
Bregs not only dampens the proinflammatory milieu in the
ischemic brain after stroke, but also promotes an M2 status
leading to tissue repair.
The prototypical cytokine used to first induce the alternative M2 activation state in MG is IL-4 (Stein et al. 1992). Both
IL-4 and the closely related cytokine IL-13 signal through IL4Rα to induce a host of downstream processes that lead to
potent anti-inflammatory functions (Gadani et al. 2012; Sica
and Mantovani 2012; Taylor et al. 2005). Our studies demonstrate that MG derived from females are adept at expressing
not only IL-10R but more importantly the IL-4R (Fig. 6a and
b). The cellular source of the CNS-derived IL-4 could be from
a number of cell types (Pepe et al. 2014), including MG cells,
although the signals that drive IL-4 production by MG cells in
the CNS are not known. Recently it was shown that IL-4-

Metab Brain Dis (2015) 30:1515–1529

treated MG cells injected into the CSF of mice with EAE
suppressed clinical symptoms and promoted
oligodendrogenesis in the spinal cord (Butovsky et al.
2006a). Moreover, the addition of IL-4 to LPS-stimulated
MG and motorneuron cocultures suppressed the release of
NO and decreased motorneuron injury (Zhao et al. 2006). A
recent study also demonstrated that the central administration
of rIL-4 elicits a heterogeneous induction of the MG M2 phenotype (Pepe et al. 2014). These studies suggest that IL-4induced MG cells are both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective and lead us to speculate that the female MG are better
able to control their proinflammatory state due to the enhanced ability to produce IL-4 (Fig. 7). The literature supports
the contention that the Bregs are distinguished by their ability
to secrete IL-10 and/or TGF-β1, while effector B cell populations produce cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, TNF-α, IL-6
(Be-2 cells) or IFNγ, IL-12 and TNFα (Be-1 cells). B cells
primed by Th2 cells and antigen (Be-2 cells) make IL-2, IL-13
and IL-4; Be-2 differentiation is dependent on the engagement
of IL-4Rα on B cells (Lund 2008). Hence our results indicate
that the ability of Bregs to produce IL-4 appears to be a response potentially amplified by an IL-4-driven feedback loop
between the MG and the Bregs that is promoted by cell-to-cell
contact with each other (Fig. 8).
Although tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is available to
aid in reperfusion for selected patients with ischemic strokes,
there is a necessity for additional treatments to reduce injury
and promote CNS tissue repair after stroke. MG activation is
one potential target. Several studies have investigated the role
of minocycline on inhibiting or altering MG activation. In a
mouse model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),
minocycline attenuated MG activation and reduced the expression of M1, but not M2, microglia/macrophage markers,
suggesting that minocycline might inhibit the proinflammatory microglia/macrophages (Kobayashi et al. 2013) (Taylor and
Sansing 2013). In the current study, our results clearly demonstrate that rIL-10 was able to reduce the TNF-α, IL-1β and
macrophage inflammatory protein-1a (MIP-1α or CCL3)
levels in activated MG. More importantly, the levels of
TNF-α, IL-1β and CCL3 levels were significantly reduced
when IL-10+ B-cells were added at a 1:1 ratio and there were
sex differences in this immunoregulation. Not only were the
IL-10-enriched B-cells able to ameliorate pro-inflammatory
cytokine production by the microglia, but they also could
induce expression of CD206, an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypic marker. MG from female mice had a higher expression of both IL-4 and IL-10 receptors and were better able to
produce IL-4 compared to their male counterparts, especially
after Breg treatment.
In summary, our results demonstrate that IL-10-producing
B-cells indeed play a crucial role in regulating MG activation,
post-MCAO. Our studies are the first to demonstrate that
while the proinflammatory milieu in the MG could be

1527

dampened by soluble factors secreted by the Bregs, induction
of the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype was promoted by cellto-cell interactions with the Bregs. Our novel observations
also highlight potentially important sex differences in MG
responses (e.g., increased IL-4 production and IL-4R and IL10R expression in female MG) induced by treatment with IL10+ regulatory B cells that could account for lower basal levels
of pro-inflammatory factors and less severe infarcts after
MCAO.
