Abstract: Physical exercise has been demonstrated to be neuroprotective in both clinical
and laboratory settings. However, the exact mechanism underlying this effect is unclear.
Our study aimed to investigate whether pre-ischemic treadmill training could serve as a
form of ischemic preconditioning in a rat model undergoing middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO). Thirty-six rats were divided into three groups: a sham control group, a
non-exercise with operation group and an exercise with operation group. After treadmill
training, ischemia was induced by occluding the MCA for 2 h, followed by reperfusion.
Half of the rats in each group were sacrificed for mRNA detection of mGluR5 and NR2B
80 min after occlusion. The remaining animals were evaluated for neurological deficits by
behavioral scoring and then decapitated to assess the infarct volume. The mRNA
expression of mGluR5 and NR2B was detected by real-time PCR. The results suggest that
pre-ischemic treadmill training may induce brain ischemic tolerance by reducing the
mRNA levels of mGluR5 and NR2B, and thus, the results indicate that physical exercise
might be an effective method to establish ischemic preconditioning.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke causes devastating complications that result in a significant burden for the entire
society [1]. Unfortunately, there are no effective strategies to successfully eliminate such
complications, so greater attention should be given to the prevention of stroke. Accumulating evidence
has indicated that physical exercise exerts beneficial effects on stroke injuries, including decreases in
cerebral infarction and edema, promotion of higher survival rates and amelioration of inflammatory
injuries [2-5]. The brain’s ability to develop a tolerance to subsequent ischemic injury after a moderate
stimulus is known as the brain ischemic tolerance (BIT) phenomenon [6]. Several kinds of
preconditioning that promote resistance to ischemic stroke have been studied, including ischemia [6],
hypoxia [7] and anoxia [8]. However, these aforementioned pretreatments might not be easily applied
as clinical intervention in individuals with risk factors for stroke. Several studies aiming to identify
easily applied pretreatments that induce resistance to cerebral ischemia have suggested that preexercise with treadmill training may reduce risk factors for stroke [3,5,9].
Excessive release of glutamate after a stroke has been shown to lead to neuronal excitotoxicity and
subsequent brain damage [10,11]. Glutamate receptor antagonists, such as those that target NR2B and
mGluR5, have been shown to reduce brain damage after stroke [12,13]. Likewise, we previously
showed that pre-ischemic treadmill training can down-regulate the excessive release of glutamate after
ischemic stroke [14]. Therefore, we sought to explore whether pre-exercise with treadmill training
directly affected glutamate receptors to clarify the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects
of physical exercise. The striatum is known to be one of the core regions that is vulnerable to ischemic
insult and enriched in glutamatergic neurons. According to our recently published paper [15], preischemic training could influence this region by regulating the mGluR1. Furthermore, in our previous
study, we found that the level of glutamate in the striatum increased to its peak value nearly 80 min
after the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) [14]. Therefore, we quantified the mRNA
levels of NR2B and mGluR5 in the striatum by real-time PCR at this time point. Our results indicate
that treadmill training down-regulated the expression of NR2B and mGluR5, possibly contributing to
the brain ischemic tolerance induced by pre-exercise with treadmill training.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Physiological Variables
Animals were divided into a sham group, an exercise with operation group and a non-exercise with
operation group. There were no significant differences observed in paO2 (partial pressure of oxygen in
arterial blood), paCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide in artery), or pH (hydrogen ion
concentration) values between the sham, non-exercise with stroke and exercise with stroke groups
before and after MCAO (Table 1).

2.2. Relative NR2B and mGluR5 mRNA Expression Levels among the Three Groups
Extracts from the striatum of the treated rats and sham controls (from rats decapitated 80 min after
occlusion) were subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analysis.
NR2B expression was significantly lower in the exercise group compared to the sham group and the
non-exercise group (P < 0.05), as indicated in Figure 1. There was also a significant difference in the
relative NR2B expression between the non-exercise group and the sham group (P < 0.05).

In regard to mGluR5, there was no significant difference in mGluR5 expression between the nonexercise group and the sham group (P > 0.05). However, mGluR5 expression was significantly
decreased in the exercise group compared to the sham group and the non-exercise group (P < 0.05), as
indicated in Figure 2.

group (P > 0.05).

2.3. Behavioral Scores
Rats in the sham group, exercise with operation group and non-exercise with operation group, were
evaluated 24 h after reperfusion. In the sham control group, none of the rats demonstrated neurological
symptoms. In contrast, there was a significant difference in behavior scores between the exercise with
operation and the non-exercise with operation groups (P < 0.05), as shown in Figure 3. The rats in the
exercise with operation group showed fewer neurological deficits than those in the non-exercise with
operation group.

2.4. Infarct Volume
After behavioral evaluation, 18 rats were sacrificed to determine the infarct volume. None of the
rats in the sham control group exhibited ischemic areas. In contrast, there was a significant difference
in infarct volume between the exercise with operation and the non-exercise with operation groups
(P < 0.05), as indicated in Figure 4. The rats in the exercise with operation group showed a
significantly reduced ischemic area in the brain relative to those in the non-exercise with
operation group.

2.5. Discussion
The glutamatergic system plays a key role in normal cerebral function and regulates the activity of
glutamate, the most abundant neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS), as well as
ionotropic NMDA, AMPA and KA (kainic acid) receptors and metabotropic G protein-coupled
receptors [16]. Furthermore, it is well known that glutamate signaling contributes to brain injury after

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2010, 11

2663

stroke. Based on these findings, it has been suggested that targeting these glutamate receptor sub-types
may serve as a novel therapeutic approach to treat stroke [17].
According to previous studies, group I mGluRs (including mGluR1 and mGluR5) are especially
important for the regulation of pyramidal cell excitability [18,19]. Furthermore, antagonists of group I
mGluRs appear to be neuroprotective, while agonists can aggravate or alleviate neuronal cell death in
vitro [20-22]. In addition, a previous study demonstrated that the selective mGluR5 antagonist MPEP
significantly reduced neuronal damage and improved neurological recovery in an animal model of
focal cerebral ischemia [23]. The above observations are further supported by another report, which
showed that MPEP and its structurally related selective mGluR5 antagonist SIB-1893 significantly
mitigated post-traumatic cell damage in vitro and improved functional recovery in vivo [24]. Another
study demonstrated stronger neuroprotective effects of mGluR5 antagonists compared to mGluR1
antagonists [25]. Thus, inhibiting hyperactivation of mGluR5 after ischemic stroke appears to be
neuroprotective.
Other studies examining ionotropic NMDA receptors have implicated these ion channels in the
induction of ischemic tolerance both in vitro and in vivo. Previous in vivo studies demonstrated that the
NMDA receptor-dependent cellular signaling pathway contributes to the mechanism of ischemic
tolerance and that new protein synthesis is also required in this process [26-28] In addition, a NMDA
receptor non-competitive antagonist attenuated ischemic tolerance, whereas an AMPA receptor
antagonist had no effect, thereby indicating that the NMDA receptor, but not the AMPA receptor,
might be involved in the induction of ischemia tolerance [29].
In vitro, NMDA-type glutamate receptors have proved to be involved in both neuronal ischemic
injury and ischemic tolerance [30]. Additionally, inhibiting NR2B attenuated ischemic cell death and
strengthened preconditioning-induced neuroprotection [12].
Therefore, it seems that a drug that can influence NMDA-type glutamate receptors could be utilized
to treat ischemic stroke. However, the development of NMDA receptor-specific drugs has been
hindered by their serious side effects observed in clinical trials [31,32]. Thus, clarifying the molecular
mechanisms by which glutamate receptors exert their functions in ischemic tolerance may offer a
potential breakthrough for the development of new methods that prevent subsequent damage after
stroke but have fewer side effects.
According to a previous study, both two-week and four-week pre-ischemic training could decrease
the infarction volume and cerebral edema after MCAO [4]. Accordingly, it was reported that exercise
preconditioning could reduce the level of inflammatory mediators and decrease the accumulation of
leukocytes after cerebral occlusion/reperfusion [5]. Furthermore, pre-exercise also was able to alleviate
cerebral permeability and strengthen brain microvascular integrity after MCAO [34].
In our previous study, we demonstrated that four weeks of treadmill training could down-regulate
the excessive release of glutamate after ischemic stroke [14]. However, whether glutamate receptors
are involved in this process is still unclear. According to a previous report, mGluR5 mRNA decreased
significantly in ischemic preconditioning group compared to the non-preconditioning group [35]. In
addition, in a previous in vitro study it was suggested that the mechanism of down-regulating NMDAR
subunits mRNA levels by oxygen/glucose deprivation or glutamate receptor antagonists could be
identical [36]. In the present study, the difference between the non-exercise group and sham group is
whether the middle cerebral artery is occluded. Cerebral ischemia might influence expression of

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2010, 11

2664

different gene at different time point. In our experiment, we detected the relative gene expression
80 min after occlusion. NR2B level significantly increased in the non-exercise group as compared with
the sham group, but the similar result did not present in mGluR5 level. It is speculated that at this time
point the cerebral ischemia influences the relative gene expression of NR2B, but not mGluR5. On the
other hand, according to previous reports [22-29], we may conclude that antagonism of NR2B and
mGluR5 could be neuroprotective in rats with MCAO. In our experiment, we showed that pre-training
could reduce brain damage after cerebral ischemia. In addition, NR2B and mGluR5 level significantly
decreased in the exercise group compared to sham group or non-exercise group. It is conjectured that
pre-training exerts neuroprotection via inhibiting the expression of NR2B and mGluR5. In addition, the
exercise group exhibited fewer behavioral deficits and a reduced infarct volume relative to the
non-exercise group. These findings indicate that both NR2B and mGluR5 may contribute to the
ischemic tolerance induced by treadmill training.
3. Experimental Methods
3.1. Animals
These experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Thirty-six healthy male Sprague–Dawley rats
(weighing 250-300 g) were provided by the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of
Sciences. The rats were housed separately under a 12:12-h light/dark cycle with water and food
available ad libitum.
3.2. Treadmill Training
Rats were randomly divided into three groups: a sham control group, an exercise with operation
group and a non-exercise with operation group (12 rats in each group). The rats in the exercise group
exercised at a speed of 6-9 m/min for 20 min per day to adapt to the running exercise. After that, the
rats began formal training on an electric treadmill machine (DSPT-202 Type 5-Lane Treadmill; Litai
Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China) over a period of four weeks. The formal training included a 25 m/min
pace at a slope of 0° for 30 min/day, six days per week. The rats in the sham control group and
non-exercise with operation group were housed freely in their cages for four weeks.
3.3. Rat MCAO Model
The protocol for our animal study was approved by the Animal Experimental Committee of Fudan,
University at Shanghai, China. All rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with chloral hydrate (10%)
at a dose of 400 mg/kg. The body temperature was maintained by a heating pad. The rat model of
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was conducted according to the Zea et al. [33] with some
modifications. Poly-L-lysine-coated intraluminal suture was used to guarantee the reliability of the
stroke model. Such suture could yield larger infarction and significantly reduce inter-animal
variability. First, we exposed the left common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA) and
internal carotid artery (ICA). The ECA was ligated, and a small incision was made. After preparing a
flame-rounded tip, a 20-mm long surgical suture was inserted into the internal carotid artery so as to

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2010, 11

2665

occlude the middle cerebral artery, which was held to the ECA with a thread. In the sham control
group, all steps were the same as in the operation group except for the occlusion of the middle cerebral
artery. For half of the rats in each group, the suture was removed 2 h after occlusion. In order to
measure physiological parameters, both 10 min before and after, MCAO blood samples were obtained
from the femoral artery to detect pH, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (paO2) and carbon dioxide
(paCO2) by a Blood Gas and Electrolyte System (Radiometer ABL505, Copenhagen, Denmark).
3.4. Evaluation of Behavioral Score
Half of the rats in each group were scored 24 h after reperfusion on a 5-point scale based on the
report of Zea et al. [33] with the following criteria: 0, no neurological symptoms; 1, unable to
completely extend the front jaw on the other side; 2, rotating while crawling and falling to the
contralateral side; 3, unable to walk without help; and 4, unconsciousness.
3.5. Determination of Brain Infarction Volume
After evaluation for behavioral scores, animals were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (10%). The
whole brain was removed as quickly as possible and placed at −20 °C for 10 min. The brain tissue was
divided into six 2-mm stions in a coronal plane. The first stion was positioned at the middle line
between the anterior pole and the optic chiasm. Afterwards, stions were simultaneously immersed in a
2% TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) solution (37 °C) for 30 min, followed by a 4%
paraformaldehyde buffer for fixation. After 24 h, all stions were photographed using a digital camera
(DC240; Kodak, USA). Imaging software (Adobe Photoshop 7.0) was employed to evaluate the
infarction volume (pink areas were normal and pale areas implied ischemia). The total infarction
volume was calculated as the sum of the infarct areas from each stion. In order to minimize the error
introduced by edema, we used an indirect method to calculate the infarct volumes [34].
Infarct volume = contralateral hemisphere region - non-infarcted region in the ipsilateral hemisphere
Infarct percentage = Infarct volume/volume of the contralateral hemisphere × 100%
3.6. Tissue Processing
Half of the rats in each group were sacrificed 80 min after occlusion, and their brains were rapidly
removed. The striatum was isolated and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until the next step.
3.7. Reverse Transcription
Stored tissue was homogenized with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for extraction of
total RNA in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, a High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to complete the reverse transcription. Each
tube contained a 20 µL reaction volume, which included 0.6 µg of total RNA (10 µL), 2 µL 10× RT
buffer, 0.8 µL of 25× dNTP (100 mM), 2 µL 10× RT Random Primers and 50 units of MultiScribeTM
Reverse Transcriptase. Tubes were heated for 10 min at 25 C, 2 h at 37 C and 5 s at 85 C. The
samples were stored at -20 C until PCR amplification.

3.8. Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Gene-specific primers (sequences in Table 2) and SYBR® Green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) were used for real-time PCR quantification of NR2B and mGluR5 with an ABI PRISM 7000
real-time thermal cycler. Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) was employed to design
oligonucleotide primers. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as the
standardized control.

The reaction settings were as follows: 1 cycle at 50 C (2 min), 1 cycle at 95 C (10 min) and
40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s and 60 C for 1 min. Cycle threshold values were selected based on the
linear range from log scaling and the baseline. The 20 µL reaction contained 2 µL of cDNA, 300 nM
of each primer and 10 µL of SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix, which included AmpliTaq Gold DNA
polymerase. Sequence Detector software (SDS version 1.6, Applied Biosystems) was used for
detecting SYBR Green reporter dye fluorescence. The relative change in the mRNA expression of the
NR2B and mGluR5 following MCAO was calculated by the following equation [37]:
Fold change = 2-ΔCt; ΔCt = (Cttarget − CtGAPDH).
3.9. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS for Windows, version 11.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
Differences in relative mRNA expression among the groups were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA
followed by a post-hoc Tamhane multiple comparison test to compare the three groups (Table 3).
Statistical significance among behavioral scores and infarct volumes of the different experimental
groups (exercise with occlusion and non-exercise with occlusion) was analyzed with an unpaired
Student’s t-test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

4. Conclusions
Our study indicated that pre-ischemic treadmill training lowered the mRNA levels of both NR2B
and mGluR5, which potentially induced BIT. Further study is needed to explore the possible

involvement of other glutamate receptors and transporters in this neuroprotective effect. Overall, our
study demonstrated that appropriate physical exercise may be an effective method for ischemic
preconditioning.
