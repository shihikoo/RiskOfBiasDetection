Background: Clinical data suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) may be used to facilitate rehabilitation after stroke. However, data are inconsistent and the neurobiological mechanisms underlying tDCS remain poorly explored, impeding its implementation into clinical routine. In the healthy rat brain, tDCS affects
neural stem cells (NSC) and microglia. We here investigated whether tDCS applied after stroke also beneﬁcially
affects these cells, which are known to be involved in regeneration and repair.
Methods: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.
Twenty-eight animals with comparable infarcts, as judged by magnetic resonance imaging, were randomized
to receive a multi-session paradigm of either cathodal, anodal, or sham tDCS. Behaviorally, recovery of motor
function was assessed by Catwalk. Proliferation in the NSC niches was monitored by Positron-EmissionTomography (PET) employing the radiotracer 3′-deoxy-3′-[18F]ﬂuoro-L-thymidine ([18F]FLT). Microglia activation was depicted with [11C]PK11195-PET. In addition, immunohistochemical analyses were used to quantify
neuroblasts, oligodendrocyte precursors, and activation and polarization of microglia.
Results: Anodal and cathodal tDCS both accelerated functional recovery, though affecting different aspects of
motor function. Likewise, tDCS induced neurogenesis independently of polarity, while only cathodal tDCS recruited oligodendrocyte precursors towards the lesion. Moreover, cathodal stimulation preferably supported
M1-polarization of microglia.
Conclusions: TDCS acts through multifaceted mechanisms that far exceed its primary neurophysiological effects,
encompassing proliferation and migration of stem cells, their neuronal differentiation, and modulation of microglia responses.

1. Introduction
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to induce long-lasting alterations of cortical excitability, thereby enhancing
cerebral plasticity, both in experimental animals (Bindman et al.,
1962) and humans (Nitsche and Paulus, 2000). Studies in human stroke
patients suggest that tDCS may be used to boost rehabilitation of motor
deﬁcits (Hummel et al., 2005), aphasia (Monti et al., 2008), and neglect
(Sparing et al., 2009), implying that tDCS may become an adjuvant tool
to promote recovery of function after stroke (Floel and Cohen, 2010).

Although cathodal and anodal tDCS have distinct opposing effects on
neuronal excitability, the inﬂuence of polarity on the clinical effects of
tDCS is complex and yet incompletely understood (Antal et al., 2004;
Moos et al., 2012; Vallar and Bolognini, 2011). Overall, the current widespread use of tDCS in human studies is contrasted by the dearth of data
regarding its basic neurobiological mechanisms, impeding its implementation into clinical routine and limiting its use for clinical studies
(Stagg and Nitsche, 2011).
Recovery of function takes place days and weeks after cerebral ischemia. Within this time frame of rehabilitation, various processes are initiated at the cellular level. Neuroinﬂammation, mediated both by
resident microglia and invading immune cells, serves to (i) demarcate
and encapsulate the necrotic infarct area, and (ii) recruit neural stem
cells (NSCs) to the lesion, but may also (iii) exacerbate tissue damage

by, e.g., production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (Stoll et al., 2002;
Wang et al., 2007). NSCs migrate towards the ischemic lesion and
promote regeneration by secretion of trophic factors conveying neuroprotection, as well as by supporting angiogenesis, remyelination,
and neural plasticity (Chopp et al., 2009). We have previously shown
that tDCS affects NSC mobilization as well as neuroinﬂammatory
processes in a polarity-dependent manner in the healthy rat brain
(Keuters et al., 2015; Rueger et al., 2012a). Here we aim at investigating
whether tDCS-induced cellular processes are associated with recovery of function after stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
Positron-Emission-Tomography (PET) were used to deliver insights
into tDCS effects in vivo and to provide readouts for a translation
into human stroke studies.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Animals and surgery
All animal procedures were in accordance with the German Laws
for Animal Protection. They were also approved by the local animal
care committee and local governmental authorities (LANUV #8751.04.2010.A332). N = 41 male spontaneously breathing male
Wistar rats weighing 290–330 g were anesthetized with 5%
isoﬂurane and maintained with 1–2% isoﬂurane in 65%/35% nitrous
oxide/oxygen. Transient focal ischemia was induced by temporary
occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) for 60 min, using
a silicone-coated nylon suture as described previously (Gerriets
et al., 2004). Animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia in
their home cages, with access to food and water ad libitum.
2.2. MRI
MRI was performed 2 days after ischemia to characterize the extent of the ischemic lesions, and in order to exclude animals with dissimilar lesions. Anesthetized with isoﬂurane, rats were placed in a
Biospec 11.7 Tesla dedicated animal scanner system with a 16 cm
horizontal bore magnet, equipped with actively shielded gradient
coils (BGA9S, 750mT/m; Bruker BioSpin, Germany). Radiofrequency
transmission was achieved with a birdcage quadrature resonator coil
(72 mm diameter); the signal was detected with a quadrature rat
brain surface coil (Bruker). A single-shot gradient echo–echo planar imaging (GE-EPI)-pilot was used for shimming as described previously
(Boehm-Sturm et al., 2011). A T2-weighted image was acquired as
rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (T2-TurboRARE), using
the protocol: FOV 3.2 cm, matrix 256 ∗ 256, slice thickness 0.5 mm,
echo time 32.5 ms, repetition time 6500 ms. During MRI, body temperature was maintained by a feedback control system (medres, Germany).
2.3. Behavioral analyses
Rats were trained daily on the Catwalk (CatWalk XT, Noldus,
Germany) for one week prior to induction of ischemia. One day before
ischemia, baseline values were established for each rat. After ischemia,
animals were allowed to recover for two full days before behavioral
testing was recommenced. Thus, three days after ischemia, and prior
to the onset of tDCS, another Catwalk session was performed to quantify
the stroke-induced motor deﬁcit. Further Catwalk sessions were performed on days 7, 10, 14, and 17. Rats were rewarded with sugar pellets
for each run. Data acquisition was performed according to strict quality
criteria: each run had to be performed within 0.5–10 s, with a maximum
variation in speed of 70%. Three separate runs fulﬁlling those quality
criteria were registered per day and rat, and averaged. For data acquisition, camera gain was set to 34.25 dB, and the intensity threshold to
0.17. Behavioral testing and the subsequent evaluation of the behavioral
data were performed by different individuals (RB, MAR); the latter
being blinded to the treatment groups.

2.4. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
Starting 3 days after ischemia, and immediately after the ﬁrst Catwalk session following stroke, 28 rats fulﬁlling the MRI-inclusion
criteria were subjected to multi-session tDCS as described previously
(Rueger et al., 2012a). In brief, an epicranial electrode with a deﬁned
contact area of 3.5 mm2 was mounted onto the intact skull over the
ischemic hemisphere using non-toxic glass ionomer luting cement
(Ketac Cem Plus, 3M-ESPE, Germany) at the coordinates: bregma
AP + 2.0 mm, ML + 2.0 mm, and left in place for the entire experiment. Animals were randomized to receive 10 days of tDCS with either cathodal (n = 9) or anodal (n = 10) polarity; a third group of
rats was sham-stimulated for control (n = 9). TDCS was repeated
daily for 5 consecutive days, followed by a tDCS-free interval of
2 days; then animals were subjected to tDCS for 5 more days, resulting
in 10 days tDCS in total. TDCS was applied continuously for 15 min at
500 μA using a constant current stimulator (CX-6650, SchneiderElectronics, Germany) under isoﬂurane anesthesia, resulting in a charge
density of 128,571 C/m2. For sham stimulation, rats were anesthetized
for 15 min without connection to the stimulator. After each tDCS session, animals were allowed to recover in their home cages with access
to food and water ad libitum.

2.5. Radiochemistry
Radiosynthesis of [11C]PK11195 was accomplished by N-methylation
using the method of Camsonne et al. (Camsonne et al., 1984) with
slight modiﬁcations, and as described previously (Schroeter et al.,
2009). 3′-deoxy-3′-[18F]ﬂuoro-L-thymidine ([18F]FLT) was synthesized
by nucleophilic substitution using benzoyl-protected anhydrothymidine
according to the method of Machulla et al. (Machulla et al., 2000) with
minor modiﬁcations, and as described previously (Rueger et al., 2010).
[11C]PK11195 selectively binds to the translocator protein-18 kDa
expressed on inﬂammatory cells, allowing for the noninvasive assessment of neuroinﬂammation in vivo (Schroeter et al., 2009). [18]FLT as
radiolabeled thymidine analog is incorporated into newly synthesized
DNA, labeling proliferating cells in the brain in vivo (Rueger et al., 2010).

2.6. PET
From n = 28 rats with conﬁrmed infarcts on MRI, n = 15 underwent
PET-imaging. PET was performed on a microPET Focus 220 scanner
(Concorde Microsystems, Inc., USA; 63 image planes; 1.5 mm full
width at half maximum). Sixteen days after induction of ischemia, animals were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and placed in the scanner. Temperature was monitored using a rectal probe and maintained at 37 ±
0.5 °C by a warm heating pad. Following a 10 min transmission scan
for attenuation correction, rats received an intravenous bolus injection
of [11C]PK11195 (0.8–1.9 mCi/rat) into a tail vein, and emission data
were acquired for 30 min. After data acquisition, animals remained in
the scanner under anesthesia. [18F]FLT-PET was performed in the
same session and without changing the animal's position between
scans, allowing for a precise co-registration of the resulting images.
Those independent measurements were possible due to the short
half-life of 11C (~ 20 min) compared to 18F (~ 110 min), by using the
11
C-labeled radiotracer ﬁrst and waiting for ﬁve half-lives before the
next tracer injection. Thus, 100 min after [11C]PK11195, animals received an intravenous bolus injection of [18F]FLT (1.7–2.2 mCi/rat),
and emission data were acquired for 90 min. PET data were reconstructed in 22 time frames of 2 × 60 s, 2 × 120 s, 6 × 240 s, and 12 × 300 s. The
last 6 frames (minutes 60–90 after tracer injection) were averaged for
quantiﬁcation of [18F]FLT-PET data.
Please note that due to limited tracer availability, only 5 rats
underwent [11C]PK11195-PET, while all rats were imaged with [18F]FLT.

2.7. Image analysis
For image co-registration, the image analysis software VINCI was
used, allowing for fast automated co-registration of all multimodal

129

imaging data (Cizek et al., 2004). Quantitative [18F]FLT-PET data evaluation was based on a Volume of Interest (VOI) analysis to determine
local radiotracer uptake within the subventricular zone (SVZ). Ellipsoid
VOIs measuring 4 mm3 were placed covering the SVZ. Standard uptake

17 days after MCA occlusion. The ischemic lesions typically involved the cerebral cortex as well as parts of the striatum (scale = 1 mm). B–D) Catwalk analysis, 3 days after stroke (B) and
longitudinal assessment of recovery (C, D). B) Occlusion of the left MCA led to a loss of motor function in the affected limb 3 days after stroke. The contact area of the affected right paw with
the surface as a surrogate for limb strength (‘print area’ in cm2, left) was decreased, as compared to the unaffected left front paw. Likewise, the duration of paw contact with the surface was
decreased in the affected right paw, corresponding to a limping gait (‘stand’ in seconds, right), compared to the unaffected left front paw (means ± SEM; **p b 0.01). C) Cathodal tDCS led
to a faster recovery of limb strength (‘print area’), measured as the print area of the affected paw divided by the unaffected paw: the group of animals treated with cathodal tDCS (triangles)
signiﬁcantly recovered their limb strength by day 10 after stroke as compared to day 3 (asterisk in triangle). Sham-stimulated rats (squares) only recovered by day 17 when compared to
their worst performance on day 3 (asterisk in square). Anodal tDCS had no effect on the recovery of limp strength over time (all values given as means ± SEM; *p b 0.05; recovery over time
was statistically assessed per individual treatment group). D) Both cathodal and anodal tDCS facilitated recovery of gait (less limping), measured as the ‘stand’ time of the affected divided
by the unaffected paw: the group of animals treated with anodal (circles) or cathodal tDCS (triangles) signiﬁcantly recovered their gait by day 14 after stroke as compared to their worst
performance on day 3 (asterisks in circle and triangle, respectively; all values given as means ± SEM; *p b 0.05; recovery over time was statistically assessed per individual treatment
group).

130

values (SUV) were calculated for each VOI, dividing maximal VOI activity by the injected radioactive dose per bodyweight. Maximum VOI
values were averaged between equally treated animals. SUVs were
individually determined and then averaged between animals within
each group.
Due to the small number of animals that could be subjected to
[11C]PK11195-PET (see above), data were only analyzed qualitatively.

2.8. Immunohistochemistry
Seventeen days after stroke, respectively one day after PET-imaging,
rats were deeply anesthetized and decapitated. Brains were rapidly
removed, frozen in isopentane, and stored at − 80 °C prior to further
processing. Serial coronal brain sections of 10 μm were cut throughout
each brain. Sections at 500 μm intervals were stained with hematoxylin
according to standard protocols. For immunohistochemistry, primary
antibodies included: polyclonal goat anti-doublecortin (DCX) to detect
neuroblasts (1:800, cat# sc-8066, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA); polyclonal rabbit anti-NG2 (1:3000, cat# AB5320, Millipore, Germany); polyclonal rabbit anti-Iba1 (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1) to
label activated microglia (1:1000, cat# 019-19741, Wako, Germany);
polyclonal rabbit anti-iNOS (inducible nitric oxide-synthetase) to detect
M1-polarized microglia (1:100, cat. #ab15323, abcam, UK); and polyclonal goat anti-CD206 to detect M2-polarized microglia (1:5000, cat.#
AF2535, R&D Systems, Germany). For visualization, the ABC-Elite kit
(Vector Laboratories, USA) with diaminobenzidine (Sigma, Germany)
as ﬁnal reaction product was used. Negative control stainings

without primary antibody showed no unspeciﬁc binding of the secondary antibody in the (peri-)infarct area (Supplemental Figure).
Lesion volumes on histological stainings were quantiﬁed using the
software Image J (NIH, USA): Lesion areas in mm2 were measured on
each affected slide, multiplied by the slice distance, and summed for
each brain, resulting in a lesion volume in mm3.
To quantify i) DCX-positive neuroblasts in the SVZ, or ii) NG2positive oligodendrocyte precursors in the peri-infarct zone, respectively, the area covered by immunoreactive cells was measured in μm2
using the software BZ-II-Analyzer (Keyence, Germany) analyzing 6 images on consecutive slides. In the analysis of oligodendrocyte precursors, the immunoreactive area was normalized to lesion size through
division by the individual infarct volume.
To quantify the number of Iba1-positive microglia in the corpus
callosum or the thalamus, or the number of NG2-positive oligodendrocyte precursors in the SVZ, respectively, images were taken from each
region of interest with a 10× objective on 3 consecutive slides, and immunoreactive cells counted per ﬁeld of view. Since we did not observe
any obvious changes of cell size between groups, this method gave robust results independent from effects of double counting or stereological distortions.
To evaluate the percentage of the infarct area covered by Iba1, iNOS
or CD206, respectively, the immunoreactive as well as the total infarct
area were measured using Image J, employing a threshold to identify
immunoreactive cells. The immunoreactive as well as the total infarct
area were measured in μm2, and a percentage calculated. Two animals
were excluded from area measurements due to insufﬁcient tissue quality of the infarct area.

the contralateral side, irrespective of tDCS (means ± SEM; *p b 0.05).

R. Braun et al. / Experimental Neurology 279 (2016) 127–136

Immunohistochemical quantiﬁcations were performed by blinded
evaluators (KG, LF, MO, JL); inter-rater reproducibility was ensured by
re-measurements from a second investigator (AL/MAR). For all quantiﬁcations, mean values were established among equally treated rats.
2.9. Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were performed with Microsoft Excel 2010
(Microsoft Corp.). All other statistical analyses were performed
with SPSS Statistics version 22 (IBM Corp.) For comparison of multiple groups, multi-factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed, followed by either Tukey's Honest Signiﬁcant difference
(HSD) or Fisher's least signiﬁcant difference (LSD) tests as post-hoc
analyses. Behavioral data were analyzed within each treatment
group using one-way ANOVA and Fisher's LSD test as post-hoc analysis. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at less than 5% level (p b 0.05).
3. Results
Only animals with comparable ischemic lesions were included in
this study, as veriﬁed by MRI 2 days after ischemia. Out of 41 rats
subjected to stroke, 28 presented with ischemic lesions comprising
both cortical and subcortical areas and were included into the
study (Fig. 1A). Mean infarct size determined ex vivo was 100 mm3
(SEM = 12), and infarct sizes did not vary signiﬁcantly between
treatment groups (anodal 95 mm3 [± 21], cathodal 99 mm3 [± 25],
sham 107 mm3 [± 19]; F(2/24) = 0.07; p = 0.93).
Following occlusion of the left MCA, rats suffered from a loss of
motor function in the right forelimb. As a surrogate marker for the
strength of the affected right paw, its contact area with the glass surface
(‘print area’) was signiﬁcantly decreased compared to the unaffected

131

left paw (means ± SEM: right 0.85 ± 0.1 vs. left 1.26 ± 0.12 cm2;
p b 0.01; Fig. 1B, left). As surrogate marker for a disturbance of gait,
i.e., limping, the duration of paw contact with the surface (‘stand’)
was decreased in the affected right paw, compared to the unaffected
left paw (means ± SEM: right 0.19 ± 0.01 vs. left 0.23 ± 0.01 cm2;
p b 0.01; Fig. 1B, right).
3.1. TDCS accelerates and improves recovery of motor function after stroke
Rats were randomized to receive anodal (n = 10), cathodal (n = 9),
or sham (n = 9) tDCS. Over the time course of 17 days following stroke,
all rats recovered at least in part from their motor deﬁcits, albeit at different speed.
Sham-treated rats recovered their strength (measured as ‘print
area’) by day 17 compared to their worst performance at day 3
(Fig. 1C, squares; p b 0.05), but did not improve in gait (measured
as ‘stand’) to a statistically signiﬁcant extent over the same period
of time (Fig. 1D, squares). The group of animals treated with cathodal
tDCS fully recovered their strength by day 10 after stroke and their
gait by day 14, as compared to worst performance on day 3, suggesting that cathodal tDCS accelerated functional recovery (Fig. 1C&D,
triangles; p b 0.05). Anodal tDCS led to a recovery of gait by day 14
compared to day 3 (p b 0.05), but animals did not fully regain limb
strength during the observed time period (Fig. 1C&D, circles).
3.2. Mobilization of endogenous neural stem cells by tDCS
To assess proliferation in the SVZ as the major stem cell niche, PET
with the radiotracer [18F]FLT was performed to visualize cell proliferation 16 days after stroke (Fig. 2A–C). Proliferation was higher in the
SVZ ipsilateral to MCA occlusion (Fig. 2D; F(5/27) = 0.57; p b 0.05

Fig. 3. TDCS induces neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ). A) After 10 days of anodal (left) or cathodal (middle) tDCS, DCX+ neuroblasts were increased in the SVZ compared to
sham-treated animals (right; scale = 100 μm). B) Anodal and cathodal tDCS signiﬁcantly increased DCX-positive neuroblasts in the SVZ ipsilateral to stimulation (*p b 0.05).

[LSD]). However, the presence or polarity of tDCS did not affect the extent of proliferation in the SVZ as judged by [18F]FLT-PET (Fig. 2D).
The effects of tDCS on neurogenesis were assessed ex vivo by staining for DCX-positive neuroblasts 17 days after stroke (Fig. 3A). The area
covered by neuroblasts in the SVZ ipsilateral to ischemia were increased
after both anodal and cathodal tDCS, compared to sham-stimulated
controls (F(5/243) = 7.06; p b 0.05 [LSD]), while the contralateral SVZ
was unaffected (Fig. 3A&B). In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus,
tDCS had no effect on neurogenesis after stroke (Fig. 3C).
We furthermore analyzed the effect of tDCS on NG2-positive oligodendrocyte precursors (Fig. 4A). The NG2-immunoreactive area bordering the ischemic lesion was widened after cathodal tDCS (Fig. 4A&B;
F(2/120) = 13.15; p b 0.01 [HSD]), suggesting enhanced migration of
oligodendrocyte precursors towards the lesion. In line with this ﬁnding,
the number of oligodendrocyte precursors in the SVZ was reduced after
cathodal tDCS (Fig. 4C; F(2/81) = 2.71; p b 0.05 [LSD]).
3.3. Effects of tDCS on neuroinﬂammation
To visualize neuroinﬂammatory processes in vivo, [11C]PK11195PET was performed in n = 5 animals. Sixteen days after stroke, accumulation of [11C]PK11195 was pronounced in two areas, (i) the ischemic lesion itself, and (ii) the ipsilateral thalamus, representing inﬂammatory
processes accompanying secondary degeneration (Fig. 5A). Immunohistochemistry veriﬁed the same areas to contain Iba1-positive activated microglia (Fig. 5B). The size of the Iba1-immunoreactive
infarct area – assessed in relation to the individual infarct size –
was increased after cathodal tDCS (Fig. 5C; F(2/51) = 3.38;
p b 0.05 cmp. to anodal tDCS [HSD]). However, tDCS had no effect
on the number of microglia in the corpus callosum adjacent to the

ischemic lesion (F(2/72) = 0.29; p = 0.74), or in the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus (F(2/72) = 0.32; p = 0.73;
Fig. 5D).
To explore the effect of tDCS on the polarization of microglia,
areas covered by iNOS-positive M1-polarized microglia (Fig. 6A), or
CD206-positive M2-polarized microglia (Fig. 6B), were assessed in
relation to the size of the individual ischemic lesion. Cathodal tDCS
signiﬁcantly increased the M1-polarization of microglia (F(2/
37) = 3.09; p b 0.05 [HSD]), while M2-polarized microglia were unaffected by tDCS (Fig. 6C; F(2/17) = 0.57; p = 0.58). Thus, the ratio
between M1- and M2-polarized microglia was slightly elevated after
cathodal tDCS, albeit not to a statistically signiﬁcant extent (Fig. 6D;
F(2/17) = 0.64; p = 0.54).
4. Discussion
Although recent stroke research has produced many novel therapeutic approaches for cerebral ischemia and its sequelae, the majority
have failed in clinical studies (O'Collins et al., 2006) resulting in a ‘translational roadblock in stroke research’ (Dirnagl et al., 2013). Suggestions
on how to overcome this roadblock have been made in internationally
concerted efforts (Dirnagl et al., 2013; Fisher et al., 2009). Speciﬁcally,
guidelines for the use of “Stem Cell Therapeutics as an Emerging Paradigm for Stroke” (STEPS) have been deﬁned for the use of stem cells
in regeneration (Diamandis and Borlongan, 2015; Savitz et al., 2014).
Recommendations include, among other measures, an obligatory deﬁnition of inclusion- and exclusion criteria, randomization of experimental animals to treatment groups, and a blinded assessment of treatment
outcome (Fisher et al., 2009). Other important requirements for successful translation into clinical practice are longitudinal pre-clinical

precursors was signiﬁcantly decreased after cathodal tDCS (all values given as mean ± SEM; *p b 0.05, **p b 0.01).

studies that evaluate therapeutic efﬁcacy via clinically relevant read-out
parameters (Walberer and Rueger, 2015). Our longitudinal study adheres to these guidelines for preclinical stroke studies, including clinical
and in vivo readout (imaging) parameters, thereby providing comprehensive insights into the behavioral as well as neurobiological effects
of tDCS in stroke rehabilitation.
Despite the widespread use of tDCS in human studies on stroke rehabilitation, few studies have determined its behavioral effects in the
experimental animal. Notably, in the rodent, spontaneous functional recovery after stroke occurs more rapidly than in humans, making it more
challenging to demonstrate relevant therapeutic effects of an experimental treatment (Schaar et al., 2010). Modeling tDCS in rodent stroke,
only marginal effects on behavioral recovery have yet been described
(Kim et al., 2010; Peruzzotti-Jametti et al., 2013; Yoon et al., 2012).
Other techniques of non-invasive neurostimulation such as transcranial
magnetic stimulation (Zhang et al., 2007) and pulsed transcranial ultrasound stimulation (Guo et al., 2015) have been studied even less in rodent stroke, with analogous results on functional recovery as seen with
tDCS. Our data on tDCS-induced motor recovery in the rat similarly suggests moderate effects; however, the strength of our study lies in
connecting the polarity-dependent behavioral impact of tDCS with its
neurobiological mechanisms showing concomitant effects on various
cell populations in the brain.
Applying tDCS over the ischemic hemisphere, we observed polaritydependent effects on recovery of motor function. While cathodal tDCS
led to a recovery of both limb strength and gait, anodally stimulated
rats regained their gait but did not regain full limb strength as measured
using a catwalk. Thus, tDCS differentially affected motor functions in a
polarity-dependent manner. From an electrophysiological point of

133

view, anodal tDCS increases – while cathodal tDCS decreases – neuronal
excitability (Nitsche and Paulus, 2000). While these polarity-dependent
changes in excitability occur after a few seconds of stimulation, longer
sessions of tDCS, like performed in the current study, cause longlasting after-effects. Those after-effects depend on a change of NMDA
receptor efﬁcacy, which is affected by tDCS-induced polaritydependent modiﬁcations in the intracellular calcium concentration
(Nitsche et al., 2003). TDCS-induced NMDA receptor signaling, in turn,
is responsible for the observation that tDCS enhances synaptic plasticity,
especially long-term potentiation (Monte-Silva et al., 2013; Rohan et al.,
2015; Stagg and Nitsche, 2011). Corresponding to those ﬁndings from
human pharmacological studies, Peruzzotti-Jametti et al. were recently
able to demonstrate a polarity-dependent effect of tDCS on cortical glutamate activity in the experimental animal (Peruzzotti-Jametti et al.,
2013). Most tDCS studies report a behavioral enhancement after anodal,
and inhibitory effects resulting from cathodal stimulation (Vallar and
Bolognini, 2011). However, this constitutes no strict dichotomy, since
cathodal tDCS has been shown to improve visual perception (Antal
et al., 2004) and attention (Moos et al., 2012). Our data suggest
polarity-dependent effects of tDCS on differential aspects of motor function such as posture and strength.
At the neurobiological level, both anodal and cathodal tDCS induced
neurogenesis in the SVZ. Since neurogenesis in the SVZ is physiologically enhanced after stroke (R. L. Zhang et al., 2008), data suggest that tDCS
augments the generation of DCX-positive neuroblasts, independent of
polarity. Proliferation of NSCs in the SVZ of the rodent brain can be
assessed by PET and the radiotracer [18F]FLT (Rueger et al., 2010). However, this method is not speciﬁc for NSC, but visualizes all proliferating
cells including, e.g., the expanding population of microglia after stroke.

Fig. 5. TDCS does not affect levels of microglia activation 16 days after stroke. A) PET with the radiotracer [11C]PK11195 (rainbow scale: SUV; co-registered to MRI in gray) detected
neuroinﬂammatory processes 16 days after stroke (scale = 1 mm). B) Iba1+ activated microglia were located within the infarct (black arrow) as well as in the thalamus (white
arrow), corresponding to [11C]PK11195-PET of the same animal depicted as (A). Scale = 1 mm. C) The infarct area covered by activated, Iba1+ microglia – corrected for the size of the
ischemic lesion – was independent of tDCS. D) The number of Iba1+ microglia in the ipsilateral, but unaffected corpus callosum was unchanged by tDCS. Likewise, Iba1+ microglia in
the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus were unaffected by tDCS (all values given as means ±SEM).

Double-tracer PET with [11C]PK11195 plus [18F]FLT allows for a distinction between inﬂammatory and other proliferating cells, i.e.
NSC, in an individual animal (Rueger et al., 2012b; Rueger and
Schroeter, 2015). In the current study, for the technical reason of
limited tracer availability, only few animals received double-tracer
PET with both [ 11 C]PK11195 and [ 18F]FLT. For this reason, we
refrained from analyzing this PET data beyond qualitative description. Both NSC proliferation and neurogenesis were observed in the
SVZ ipsilateral, but not contralateral, to ischemia. This is in line
with a previous report on impaired neurogenesis in the hemisphere
contralateral to cerebral ischemia (Buga et al., 2008).
The generation of oligodendrocyte precursors from the SVZ and
their migration towards the ischemic lesion was increased only
after cathodal – but not anodal – tDCS. Stimulating the proliferation
of oligodendrocyte precursors by pharmacological means facilitates
recovery after stroke by supporting remyelination (Han et al.,
2015), providing this mechanisms as one possible explanation for
the beneﬁcial effect of cathodal tDCS. Interestingly, data suggest
that while tDCS increased the amount of neuroblasts generated in
the SVZ, it did not affect the number but rather the migration of oligodendrocyte precursors after stroke.
Previous studies have suggested differentiation of NSCs into oligodendrocytes to be associated with an M2-polarization of microglia
(Han et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015). After cathodal tDCS, in contrast we
observed that migration of oligodendrocyte precursors towards the
lesion occurred concurrently with an M1-polarization of microglia.
Thus, our results corroborate ﬁndings by Miron et al. showing that
M1-macrophages dominate early after demyelination and support
proliferation and migration of oligodendrocyte precursors, while a
later M2-polarization induces the terminal differentiation of precursors into mature oligodendrocytes (Miron et al., 2013). Current literature generally associates M1-polarization of microglia with a more
aggressive, pro-inﬂammatory phenotype, while M2-polarized microglia
were suggested to act neuroprotectively (Mantovani et al., 2004;
Orihuela et al., 2015). Counterintuitively, we found cathodal tDCS
accelerated functional recovery while promoting M1-polarization, suggesting that the relationship between polarization and function in microglia is complex, and corroborating previous ﬁndings that – in
particular – temporospatial dynamics of microglia polarization after
stroke play a key role in recovery (Hu et al., 2012). In the current
study, we did not observe an upregulation of Iba1, iNOS or CD206 by microglia in the unlesioned hemisphere contralateral to ischemia. A recent
report suggests that MHC-II-expressing microglia migrate to this
contralesional hemisphere via the corpus callosum, starting about
4 days after induction of ischemia (Kuric and Ruscher, 2014). Likewise,
hematogenous immune cells invading the brain after stroke are
detected in the corpus callosum at around the same time (Wiart et al.,
2007). Microglia expressing MHC-II are physiologically found in the
perivascular space, their upregulation after cerebral ischemia involves
an expansion into unaffected healthy tissue, farther than, e.g., CD68positive phagocytic microglia (Walberer et al., 2010). Interestingly, microglia invasion of the contralateral corpus callosum seems to be associated with enhanced functional recovery (Kuric and Ruscher, 2014),
suggesting that they might control the aberrant dendritic sprouting in
the contralesional hemisphere occurring in the weeks after stroke,
which is associated with poor functional recovery (Jones and
Schallert, 1992; Wang et al., 2012).
We here applied tDCS at relatively high charge density of
128,571 C/m2, while in humans, lower charge densities of ~ 480 C/m2
are routinely used. Nitsche et al. showed that the strength of tDCS
after-effects depends on the charge density (Nitsche and Paulus,

135

2000). In this proof-of-principle study, we chose a high charge density
to amplify the hypothesized effects of tDCS allowing for their characterization. In previous studies, we have demonstrated that the charge density applied here is safe and does not induce lesions (Keuters et al.,
2015; Rueger et al., 2012a).
5. Conclusions
After stroke, anodal and cathodal tDCS both (compared to control)
exerted positive effects on functional recovery. At the neurobiological
level, tDCS affected various cellular processes involved in regeneration
and repair: data show that tDCS modulated neurogenesis, oligodendrocyte precursor recruitment, and microglia polarization, in a polaritydependent way. Thus, tDCS exerts its beneﬁcial behavioral effects
through multifaceted neurobiological mechanisms that exceed its primary neurophysiological effects. The cellular processes affected by
tDCS are key events characterizing the subacute and chronic phase of
stroke, i.e., days and weeks after cerebral ischemia. In this phase, tDCS
thus boosts functional recovery by facilitating regeneration on the cellular as well as on the structural level.
