Objective: The cerebral microvasculature is rendered more vulnerable to thrombus formation following a brief
(5.0 min) period of focal ischemia. This study examined the contribution of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a neuroprotective
and prothrombotic cytokine produced by the brain, to transient ischemia-induced thrombosis in cerebral arterioles.
Approach & results: The middle cerebral artery of C57BL/6 J mice was occluded for 5 min, followed by 24 h of
reperfusion (MCAo/R). Intravital ﬂuorescence microscopy was used to monitor thrombus development in cerebral
arterioles induced by light/dye photoactivation. Thrombosis was quantiﬁed as the time of onset of platelet
aggregation on the vessel wall and the time for complete blood ﬂow cessation. MCAo/R in wild type (WT) mice
yielded an acceleration of thrombus formation that was accompanied by increased IL-6 levels in plasma and in
post-ischemic brain tissue. The exaggerated thrombosis response to MCAo/R was blunted in WT mice receiving
an IL-6 receptor-blocking antibody and in IL-6 deﬁcient (IL-6−/−) mice. Bone marrow chimeras, produced by
transplanting IL-6−/− marrow into WT recipients, did not exhibit protection against MCAo/R-induced thrombosis.
Conclusions: The increased vulnerability of the cerebral vasculature to thrombus development after MCAo/R is
mediated by IL-6, which is likely derived from brain cells rather than circulating blood cells. These ﬁndings suggest
that anti-IL-6 therapy may reduce the likelihood of cerebral thrombus development after a transient ischemic
attack.

1. Introduction
The effects of ischemia, with or without reperfusion, on the brain
have been extensively characterized. These studies have revealed the
inﬂuence of a variety of factors on the brain injury response to an ischemic episode, with the magnitude and duration of insult representing
major determinants of the injury response. Ischemic insults of long duration typically elicit severe tissue injury characterized by neuronal cell
death, blood–brain barrier dysfunction and edema, which collectively
result in brain infarction and a potentially debilitating stroke (Jung
et al., 2010). Ischemic insults of shorter durations are better tolerated
by the brain and often result in little or no lasting brain damage and
neurological impairment. There is also a large body of evidence demonstrating that prior exposure of the brain to a transient ischemic insult of
short duration confers a protective phenotype that allows brain tissue
to tolerate a subsequent and more severe ischemic insult (Kirino,
2002; Gidday, 2006). The phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning
(or ischemic tolerance) has been attributed to an increased expression

of protective genes and the production of neuroprotective agents that
render the brain more resistant to ischemic injury. While neurons are
generally considered the primary cellular target of the ischemic preconditioning (IPC) response in brain (Gidday, 2006), there is evidence that
the protection is also evidenced in different cellular components of the
cerebral microvasculature, including endothelial cells, and is manifested
as improved blood brain-barrier function, decreased endothelial adhesiveness to circulating leukocytes, and enhanced angiogenesis (Kirino,
2002; Gidday, 2006). A recently described deleterious consequence of
a brief, transient ischemic insult on the cerebral vasculature is accelerated thrombus development, which is more pronounced in arterioles than
in venules (Tang et al., 2014). The enhanced thrombogenesis occurs despite evidence for prolonged coagulation and bleeding times after IPC
(Chen et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2008), and the thrombosis response is
not altered by treatment with anti-platelet agents such as aspirin,
clopidogrel, and dypiridamole (Tang et al., 2014). The nature and origin
of the prothrombogenic stimulus that mediates this deleterious response to transient cerebral ischemia remain unclear.
Interleukin-6, one of the major cytokines produced by the central
nervous system (Erta et al., 2012; Gadient and Otten, 1994; Schöbitz
et al., 1993), exerts a variety of biological actions that impact on the injury and repair responses of the brain to an ischemic insult (Tuttolomondo
et al., 2008). Potential beneﬁcial effects of the cytokine include stimulation of neurogenesis and angiogenesis, inhibition of apoptosis, and

blood–brain barrier stabilization (Jung et al., 2011; Erta et al., 2012). In
contrast to these neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects, IL-6 has
been reported to exert pro-inﬂammatory, pro-oxidative, and prothrombogenic actions (Spychalowicz et al., 2012; Senchenkova et al., 2013). A
net protective effect of IL-6 in ischemic stroke is suggested by some animal studies that show an exaggerated brain injury response to mild
transient ischemia in both IL-6−/− mice (Herrmann et al., 2003; Gertz
et al., 2012) and in obese (ob/ob) mice treated with an IL-6 neutralizing
antibody (Terao et al., 2008). Ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks in humans are associated with signiﬁcant increases in plasma IL-6
concentration, and the results of several clinical studies have revealed
the cytokine to be a strong predictor of brain injury and clinical outcome
(Hoshi et al., 2005; Orion et al., 2008). Similar increases in plasma, as
well as brain tissue, IL-6 concentration (or mRNA) have been described
in animal models of ischemic stroke (Chapman et al., 2009; Offner
et al., 2009; Terao et al., 2008; Gertz et al., 2012).
Studies in other organ systems and different pathological conditions
have revealed that IL-6 is also a potent prothrombogenic cytokine (van
der Poll et al., 1994; Mutlu et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2014). Anti-IL-6 therapies have been reported to reduce thrombus development in animal
models of deep vein thrombosis (Wojcik et al., 2011) and in the microvessel thrombosis associated with experimental colitis (Senchenkova
et al., 2013). The cytokine is known to promote a variety of responses
that favor coagulation/thrombosis, including thrombocytosis secondary
to stimulation of thrombopoiesis (Zhang et al., 2013), induction of
platelet-leukocyte aggregation (Yan et al., 2014), and platelet activation
(Peng et al., 1994; Yan et al., 2014). The cytokine also exerts an inﬂuence
on the coagulation system, as evidenced by its ability to enhance the expression of tissue factor, ﬁbrinogen, factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor, and to increase thrombin generation. IL-6 also reduces inhibitors of
hemostasis such as anti-thrombin and protein S (Tuttolomondo et al.,
2008). These prothrombotic actions of IL-6, coupled to the welldescribed elevation in plasma and tissue IL-6 concentration that occurs
in response to brain ischemia (Hoshi et al., 2005; Orion et al., 2008), suggest that it is a viable candidate mediator of the prothrombogenic phenotype that is assumed by the cerebral microvasculature in response to
transient cerebral ischemia. Hence, the overall goal of this study was to
assess, using both immunologic and genetic approaches, the contribution of IL-6 to the accelerated thrombus formation elicited in cerebral
arterioles following a brief ischemic episode. IL-6 deﬁcient bone marrow chimeras were also used to identify the likely source of IL-6 in
mediating the ischemia-induced thrombogenesis.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Male (23–33 g body weight) C57BL/6 J and IL-6−/− (B6.129S6-IL6tml
, C57BL/6 J background) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). A total of 123 mice were used in the study. The
distribution of mice in the different experimental groups is outlined in
the ﬁgure legends. The experimental procedures were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at LSU Health Sciences
Center and are in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. All efforts were made to minimize animal distress and the number
of animals used.

2.2. Induction of transient cerebral ischemia (MCAo/R)
Mice were anesthetized with 150 mg/kg ketamine and 7.5 mg/kg
xylazine. Core body temperature was monitored and maintained at
36 ± 0.5 °C using a heating blanket during surgery and until recovery
from anesthesia. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced using
the intraluminal ﬁlament method, as described previously (Tang et al.,
2014). Brieﬂy, a blunted 6–0 silicone-coated monoﬁlament (Doccol Corporation, CA) was introduced into the common carotid artery through

an arteriotomy below the carotid bifurcation and advanced along the internal carotid artery into the Circle of Willis until mild resistance was
felt, indicating that the ﬁlament had entered the anterior cerebral artery
and blocked the origin of middle cerebral artery (MCA). Following MCA
occlusion for a period of 5 min, the ﬁlament was withdrawn, allowing
for brain reperfusion for a period of 24 h. We have previously demonstrated that the 5 min ischemia/24 reperfusion (MCAo/R) protocol
does not yield signiﬁcant sustained neurological deﬁcits nor does it produce detectable brain infarction (Tang et al., 2014). Sham mice were
subjected to the same procedure without arteriotomy and monoﬁlament insertion.
2.3. Intravital videomicroscopy
Following 24 h of reperfusion (after MCA occlusion), the mice were
prepared for intravital microscopic observation of the brain, as previously described (Tang et al., 2014). Brieﬂy, the mice were anesthetized,
a craniectomy was performed and the animal was placed on the stage of
an upright ﬂuorescent microscope (BX51WI; Olympus, Japan) and
allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. Visualization of individual cerebral
microvessels and the induction of thrombus formation were achieved
using a 40 × water immersion objective lens (LUMPlan FI/IR 40 ×/
0.80 ×; Olympus). A silicon-intensiﬁed target video camera (C-240008, Hamamatsu, Japan) or a charge-coupled device video camera (XC77; Hamamatsu, Japan) projected the images onto a monitor (Trinitron
PVM-2030; Sony, Japan), which was connected to a video timer (TimeDate Generator WJ-810; Panasonic, Japan) to record time and date. The
images were recorded on a DVD recorder (SR-MV50; JVC, Wayne, NJ).
The diameters of the selected microvessels were measured by video
analysis software (Image J software version 1.37; NIH, US) on a personal
computer (G4 Macintosh; Apple, CA).
2.4. Light/dye induced thrombosis
A 10 ml/kg body weight dose of 5% ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate dextran (FITC; 150,000 molecular weight; Sigma-Aldrich, US) was injected
into the femoral vein cannula and allowed to circulate for 10 min before
photoactivation. Photoactivation of FITC (excitation, 495 nm; emission,
519 nm) was initiated by exposing 100 μm vessel (arteriole) length to
epi-illumination with a 175-W xenon lamp (Lamda LS, Sutter, US)
coupled with a ﬂuorescein ﬁlter cube (HQ-FITC; Chroma Technology,
US). The excitation power density was calibrated daily (ILT 1700 Radiometer, SED033 detector; International Light Technologies, US) and
maintained within 1% of 0.17 W/cm2, as previously described (Tang
et al., 2014). During continuous epi-illumination, thrombus formation
was visualized and quantiﬁed in both venules and arterioles (diameters:
20–40 μm) by determining the time of onset of platelet deposition/
aggregation (onset time) and the time to complete blood ﬂow cessation
(cessation time). Epi-illumination of a vessel under study was discontinued once blood ﬂow ceased. The results of both onset time and
cessation time were averaged from 2 to 4 induced thrombi in each arteriole of the same mouse.
2.5. IL-6 in plasma and brain tissue
A cytometric bead array (Mouse soluble protein master buffer kit;
BD Biosciences USA) was used to measure the concentration of IL-6.
Brieﬂy, plasma and supernatants of left and right hemisphere brain tissues were collected at 24 h after MCAo/R. For these experiments, mice
were transcardially perfused (to ﬂush the cerebral vasculature) with
1 × phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The samples were processed and
analyzed with the cytometric beads as per the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of IL-6 was expressed as pg/ml in plasma or
pg/g brain weight for the tissue samples.

2.6. Generation of IL-6−/− bone marrow chimeras

3. Results

Bone marrow (BM) chimeras were produced by transplanting bone
marrow from either WT or IL-6−/− donor mice into lethally irradiated
WT recipient mice, as previously described (Stokes et al., 2006). Brieﬂy,
BM was isolated from the femurs and tibias of donor mice expressing
CD45.2 leukocyte antigen and a minimum of 2 × 106 cells in 200 μl
PBS were administered via the femoral vein into recipient mice previously irradiated with two doses of 500–525 rad, 3 h apart. The chimeric
mice were kept in autoclaved cages, with 0.2% neomycin drinking water
for 2 weeks, followed by normal water. Flow cytometry was used to
verify chimera reconstitution at 6–8 weeks by staining for leukocyte
CD45.2 expression using a FITC-conjugated antibody and CD45.1
expression using a PE-conjugated antibody. Mice exhibiting N90%
chimerization were used.
Some WT mice received an antibody that blocks the alpha subunit of
the IL-6 receptor (rat anti-IL-6α (CD126) from Angio-Proteomic, Boston,
MA, 4 mg/Kg) that was administered (i.v.) 24 h before the experiment.

Estimates of cerebral blood ﬂow derived from LASCA imaging (Supplementary Fig. S1) revealed that MCAo yielded a signiﬁcant reduction
in brain tissue blood ﬂow in the region (ipsilateral) perfused by the
MCA, without accompanying changes in the same region of the contralateral hemisphere. MCA occlusion elicited a similar reduction in ipsilateral blood ﬂow in both wild type and IL-6−/− mice, and the magnitude of
the reduction observed in both groups is comparable to values previously
reported using laser speckle imaging following MCAo (Ayata et al., 2004).

2.7. Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis (LASCA)
Blood ﬂow in the brain region perfused by the MCA was monitored using a high resolution LASCA imaging system (PeriCam PSI,
Perimed, Järfälla-Stockholm, Sweden), as previously described
(Ayata et al., 2004). After the induction of anesthesia, a midline sagittal scalp incision was made and the periosteum removed to expose
the surface of the skull. The skull surface was cleansed with saline
and lightly swabbed with mineral oil to prevent drying. Speckle images (18 mm × 20 mm) were acquired at 6 images/s under 785 nm
laser illumination. Both wild type and IL-6−/− mice were imaged before (baseline) and 5 min after ﬁlament insertion for MCAo. PIMSoft
software was use to drive the system and capture images/data for
ofﬂine analysis. Blood perfusion units were quantiﬁed in a 3.5 mm2
region of interest in the MCA branches region. Because the MCA
branches region was not always visible on the ipsilateral side, the
3.5 mm2 region of interest in this area was placed in the identical location as the baseline image.

2.8. Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means ± SEM unless otherwise indicated.
One-way ANOVA was used with the Bonferroni or Fisher's post hoc
test. Differences between two data sets were determined using the
two-tailed unpaired t-test. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at
p b 0.05.

3.1. IL-6 concentration increases in plasma and brain tissue following
transient brain ischemia
Following 5 min cerebral ischemia and 24 h reperfusion (MCAo/R),
the concentration of IL-6 was measured in plasma and both brain (ipsilateral and contralateral) hemispheres. IL-6 concentration in plasma
was signiﬁcantly elevated (3.3-fold) following MCAo/R (Fig. 1A). A signiﬁcant (3.7-fold) increase in IL-6 concentration was detected in the ipsilateral hemisphere while a smaller (75%) increase was noted in the
contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 1B).
3.2. IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) immunoblockade blunts the thrombosis response
in cerebral arterioles subjected to MCAo/R
Thrombus formation in cerebral arterioles, assessed using the time
of onset of platelet deposition/aggregation (onset time) as well as the
time for complete blood ﬂow cessation after light/dye-induced vessel
injury, was quantiﬁed in control (untreated) WT, untreated WT mice
subjected to MCAo/R, and WT-MCAo/R mice treated with an IL-6R
blocking antibody (Fig. 2). As previously reported (Tang et al., 2014),
MCAo (5 min) followed by 24 h reperfusion signiﬁcantly enhanced
thrombus development induced by light/dye injury in cerebral arterioles of WT mice. Immunoblockade of IL-6R signiﬁcantly blunted the accelerated thrombus development associated with MCAo/R, as reﬂected
by increases in both onset and cessation times.
3.3. MCAo/R accelerated thrombosis is attenuated in IL-6 deﬁcient mice
IL-6−/− mice were used to determine whether genetic deﬁciency of
this cytokine imparts a protective effect similar to that observed with IL6R immunoblockade. Fig. 3 illustrates that while transient cerebral ischemia elicits a signiﬁcant and profound acceleration of light/dyeinduced thrombosis in cerebral arterioles of WT mice, this response
was not observed in IL-6 deﬁcient mice. The protective effect of IL-6 deﬁciency was manifested in both indices of thrombogenicity, i.e., onset
time (panel A) and time to ﬂow cessation (panel B).

3.5. Blood cell-derived IL-6 does not contribute to the accelerated thrombus
development elicited by MCAo/R
Fig. 5 summarizes the results of thrombosis experiments in bone
marrow chimeras (WT → WT and IL-6−/− → WT) following exposure
to transient cerebral ischemia. In both WT → WT and IL-6−/− → WT chimeras, MCAo/R resulted in an acceleration of the time of onset (panel
A) and time to ﬂow cessation (panel B). The lack of protection noted
in the IL-6−/− → WT chimeras suggest that blood cell derived IL-6
does not contribute to the enhanced light/dye induced thrombosis elicited by MCAo/R.

3.4. Contribution of circulating blood cells to changes in IL-6 concentration
in plasma and brain tissue following MCAo/R
Bone marrow (BM) chimeras were produced by transplanting
BM from either wild type mice (WT → WT) or IL-6−/− mice (IL-6−/−
→ WT) into WT recipients. A comparison of the changes in brain tissue
IL-6 concentration after MCAo/R in WT → WT and IL-6−/− → WT mice
(Fig. 4, panel A) revealed that the control (WT → WT) chimeras yielded
an increased IL-6 concentration in ipsilateral (but not contralateral)
brain tissue similar (3.2-fold) to that noted in WT mice (Fig. 1). However, only an 80% increase in ipsilateral tissue IL-6 concentration was
detected in bone marrow chimeras with circulating blood cells deﬁcient
in IL-6 (IL-6−/− → WT mice), suggesting that the IL-6 detected in
postischemic brain tissue is mostly (67%) derived from circulating
cells. WT → WT chimeras exhibited a signiﬁcant (~80%) increase in plasma IL-6 concentration following MCAo/R (Fig. 4 panel B), while no signiﬁcant change in plasma IL-6 concentration was noted in IL-6−/−
→ WT chimeras.

Transient ischemic attacks (TIA), traditionally deﬁned as an ischemic
stroke of short duration that produces focal neurological dysfunction
without objective evidence of brain infarction (Easton et al., 2009;
Sacco et al., 2013), are known to render the brain more vulnerable to
a subsequent, more severe ischemic episode, with approximately 30%
of TIA patients later experiencing a serious stroke (Dennis et al.,
1990). Antiplatelet drugs, which represent the ﬁrst line of therapeutic
intervention after TIA, show signiﬁcant clinical efﬁcacy in the secondary
prevention of strokes (Johnston, 2005). However, the risk of stroke is reduced by only one-third even in TIA patients placed on a combination of
antiplatelet drugs, such as aspirin and dipyridamole (Diener et al., 1996;
CAPRIE Steering Committee, 1996; Field et al., 2013), suggesting the
need for alternate therapeutic targets. In a recent animal study from
our laboratory (Tang et al., 2014), it was revealed that a brief ischemic
insult (2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 min) renders the cerebral vasculature hyperresponsive to thrombus formation in response to vessel wall injury.
The transient ischemia-induced enhancement of thrombus development in murine cerebral arterioles was evident as long as 28 days following the ischemic insult, and the thrombosis was unresponsive to
treatment with antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents. The results of
the present study implicates IL-6, a prothrombotic cytokine that accumulates in plasma and brain tissue after a TIA or stroke (Hoshi et al.,
2005; Orion et al., 2008), as a major mediator of the accelerated thrombosis response elicited in cerebral arterioles following a brief episode of
focal brain ischemia. This novel ﬁnding raises the possibility of targeting
IL-6 for the secondary prevention of stroke following a TIA.
Clinical studies have revealed that IL-6 levels are elevated in plasma
of patients suffering from TIA or ischemic stroke, and these studies suggest that plasma IL-6 concentration is predictive of the severity of the
stroke as well as clinical outcome (Lambertsen et al., 2012; Shaaﬁ
et al., 2014). Animal experiments have also demonstrated elevated
plasma IL-6 concentrations in the reperfusion period following

45–60 min of MCA occlusion (Chapman et al., 2009; Offner et al., 2009;
Terao et al., 2008). The results of our study reveal that plasma IL-6 concentration is signiﬁcantly elevated even following a very brief (5.0 min)
period of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion, which is consistent with reports describing increased plasma IL-6 levels in TIA patients (Hoshi
et al., 2005). The increased systemic (plasma) IL-6 concentration following ischemic stroke is accompanied by a signiﬁcant increase in brain tissue IL-6 concentration, which typically achieves a peak tissue level
several hours following the early (1–3 h after reperfusion) elevation in
plasma IL-6 concentration (Chapman et al., 2009). Immune cells (either
circulating or residing in the spleen) and several resident cell populations in the brain (e.g., neurons, astrocytes, microglia, endothelial
cells) are known to synthesize IL-6 (Woodroofe et al., 1991; Schöbitz
et al., 1993; Reyes et al., 1999; Van Wagoner and Benveniste, 1999).
Consequently, the elevated brain tissue IL-6 concentration noted following ischemic stroke may reﬂect either locally and/or systemically
generated IL-6. In an effort to determine the relative contributions of
local vs systemic sources of IL-6 to the elevated cytokine level detected
in ipsilateral brain tissue after a brief episode of MCA occlusion, we measured tissue IL-6 concentration in plasma and in brain tissue of bone
marrow (BM) chimeric mice wherein the circulating cells are incapable
of producing IL-6 (IL-6−/− → WT chimeras). The results of these experiments suggest that circulating cells account for all of the rise in plasma
IL-6 concentration, while approximately two-thirds of the IL-6 in brain
tissue after MCAo/R is derived from circulating cells, with the remaining
one-third generated by resident brain cells. This observation is inconsistent with the results of a previous study, wherein WT → IL-6−/− BM chimeras revealed that brain cells are the major source of IL-6 in a different

mouse model of MCAo/R that involved a 30 min occlusion period,
followed by 48 h reperfusion (Gertz et al., 2012). This inconsistency
could result from a waning inﬂuence of circulating immune cells on
IL-6 production in postischemic brain at later reperfusion periods or
may reﬂect a differential response of IL-6 producing brain cells to a
more severe ischemic insult.
The results of this study implicate IL-6 in the hyper-responsiveness
of cerebral arterioles to thrombus development following exposure of
the brain to a brief period of focal ischemia. Using both immunologic
(IL-6R blocking antibody) and genetic (IL-6 deﬁcient mice) approaches,
we demonstrated that ablation of IL-6 function largely prevented the accelerated thrombus formation elicited by MCAo/R. Our observation that
IL-6 ablation protects that cerebral vasculature from thrombosis is
consistent with several reports that describe the ability of this cytokine
to promote coagulation and alter platelet function (van der Poll et al.,
1994; Peng et al., 1994). Furthermore, our results are in line with ﬁndings derived from other experimental models of human disease, including sepsis (van der Poll et al., 1994), deep vein thrombosis (Wojcik et al.,
2011), and inﬂammatory bowel disease (Senchenkova et al., 2013), that
implicate IL-6 as a critical player in the thrombogenesis that accompanies these conditions. In a recent study (Yan et al., 2014), it was demonstrated that chronic (7-day) infusion of IL-6 via an Alzet pump into
WT mice signiﬁcantly enhanced light/dye-induced thrombus development in cremaster muscle arterioles, as reﬂected by shorter times of
thrombus onset and ﬂow cessation. The plasma IL-6 concentration
achieved with this infusion protocol (33 pg/ml) is comparable to the
IL-6 level detected in our MCAo/R model (Fig. 1), which supports the
view that the elevated IL-6 levels elicited by a brief period of brain

ischemia is sufﬁcient to promote thrombus development in arterioles of
the brain and other organs. Given the pleiotropic actions of IL-6, which
include effects on endothelial cells, platelets and the coagulation system, it remains unclear how IL-6 exerts its prothrombotic effects in
the postischemic brain and whether this IL-6 dependent reaction reﬂects the responses on a single or multiple cellular and/or chemical
targets.
Another issue addressed in this study is the source of IL-6 that ultimately induces the prothrombotic phenotype in the postischemic
cerebral microvasculature. A comparison of the cerebral arteriolar
thrombosis responses between WT → WT and IL-6−/− → WT BM chimeras revealed similar thrombosis responses to light/dye injury,
suggesting that eliminating the IL-6 derived from circulating blood
cells did not afford the protection observed in IL-6−/− mice. This observation, coupled to our IL-6 measurements in plasma and brain tissue of the BM chimeras (Fig. 4), indicates that the IL-6 derived from
brain cells, rather than plasma, is largely responsible for inducing the
prothrombogenic phenotype in the postischemic cerebral vasculature. While our ﬁndings indicate that brain cells account for only
one-third of the increased tissue IL-6 concentration detected in ipsilateral brain tissue after MCAo/R, it would appear that either this
concentration is sufﬁcient to elicit the thrombosis response
or, more likely, that the cells generating the IL-6 lie within
(e.g., endothelial cells) and/or in close proximity (e.g., neurons, astrocytes) to cerebral arterioles. For example, astrocytes, which extend their foot processes around cerebral arterioles in mouse brain
(Yata et al., 2014), may generate locally high levels of IL-6 that account for the critical role of this cytokine in mediating the accelerated arteriolar thrombosis in the postischemic brain. Additional work
is needed to deﬁnitively identify the cellular source(s) of the IL-6
that underlies the MCAo/R induced thrombogenesis.
In conclusion, the ﬁndings of this study support a role for
interleukin-6 in mediating the enhanced thrombus development that
occurs in the cerebral microvasculature following a brief episode of
focal brain ischemia. Our results also suggest that brain cell-derived
IL-6 is largely responsible for this microvascular response. The relevance
of these ﬁndings to thrombotic strokes of intracranial origin that involve
thrombus development in larger arteries remains unclear. However,
this work suggests that consideration should be given to IL-6 as a therapeutic target for secondary stroke prevention following a transient
ischemic attack.
