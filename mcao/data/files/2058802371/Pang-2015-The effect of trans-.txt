Post-stroke depression (PSD) occurs about 40% among all stroke survivors, but the effective pharmacotherapy is inadequately understood. The present study investigated the effects of a natural polyphenol
trans-resveratrol (RES) on behavioral changes after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and
examined what its molecular targets may be. RES was shown to decrease the infarct size and neurological scores after MCAO, suggesting the amelioration of brain damage and motor activity. RES also
reversed the depressive-like behaviors 13 days after MCAO, both in the forced swimming and sucrose
consumption tests. Moreover, MCAO-induced series abnormalities related to depressive-like behaviors,
such as an abnormal adrenal gland weight to body weight ratio, an increased expression of the
corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus, the differential expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in these three brain regions, and a decreased brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level, were ameliorated after treatment with increasing doses of
RES at 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg via gavage. These ﬁndings provide compelling evidence that RES protects the
brain against focal cerebral ischemia-induced injury, but most of all is its antidepressant-like effect on
PSD, which might at least in part be mediated by regulation of hypothalamusepituitaryeadrenal axis
function.

occur about 40% among all stroke survivors (Hackett and Pickles,
2014; Loubinoux et al., 2012; Deplanque et al., 2011). Patients
with PSD may develop cognitive impairment, mental regression,
depression, discouragement or anxiety compared with stroke patients without depression (Robinson, 2003). The Medicare often
underestimates these mental disorders and the treatment for
depression after stroke can only be taken care of with little effort or
even be ignored (Jeong et al., 2014; Bantsiele et al., 2009), leading to
the increases in their physical disability and even mortality. The
hypotheses on the pathophysiological nature of PSD have been
addressed, i.e. biogenic amine neurotransmitters and neuroendocrine disruption, oxidative stress, as well as neuronal

apoptosis (Ji et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2009). More recent evidence
indicates that improving encephalic condition of ischemia is associated with the amelioration of depression and anxiety (Nabavi
et al., 2015). However, the speciﬁc etiology and pathophysiology
of PSD remain much debate and effective pharmacotherapy for PSD
is largely under developed.
Our previous study suggested that polyphenols play important
roles in stress-induced depressive-like behaviors due to their
regulation
of
monoaminergic
system
and
hypothalamusepituitaryeadrenal (HPA) axis function, leading to neuroprotection and neurogenesis (Xu et al., 2006, 2007, 2011).
Increasing clinical observations suggest that some traumatic brain
injuries including middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), may
act as precipitating factors in the onset of affective illness of PSD
that are closely associated with attenuated HPA axis feedback and
decreased neurotrophic protein expression (Oquendo et al., 2003;
Weidenfeld et al., 2011). As one of the polyphenols, trans-resveratrol (3,40 ,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene, RES) is the major active
component of polygonum cuspidatum, which is also enriched in
the grapes, red wine and some other dietary products (Bai et al.,
2010). Trans-resveratrol has achieved widespread attention for its
potential use as a therapeutic agent in the prevention and treatment of numerous diseases, including antioxidant, antiinﬂammatory, neuroprotective properties and amelioration of
learning and memory impairment (Tredici et al., 1999; Chen et al.,
2007; Ranney and Petro, 2009). The previous studies in our laboratory suggested that acute treatment with trans-resveratrol exhibits antidepressant-like effect; the underlying mechanism may
be involved in the regulation of neurotransmitters dysfunction
induced by chronic stress (Yu et al., 2013). However, studies
examining the relationship between the neuroendocrine disruptions induced by MCAO and those of polyphenols treatment are
lacking.
In the ﬁrst set of our study, we examined the effects of transresveratrol on the neurological scores and brain infarct volume
after treatment with trans-resveratrol for 7 days prior to the MCAO
surgery (i.e. 22 h after MCAO). Subsequently, the antidepressantlike effects of trans-resveratrol on PSD were observed both 22 h
and 14 days after MCAO surgery, in the forced swimming and sucrose preference tests. The related neuroendocrine and neuroprotective parameters, such as adrenal glands index, corticotropinreleasing factor (CRF), glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and brain
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression, were also
measured for uncovering the possible mechanism of trans-resveratrol treatment on PSD.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Male SpragueeDawley (SD) rats (250e280 g) were obtained from the Animal
Center of Shanghai Branch, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Upon arrival, two rats
were housed in each cage and acclimatized to a colony room with controlled
ambient temperature (22 ± 1  C), humidity (50 ± 10%) and a 12-h natural light/dark
cycle. They were allowed to acclimatize to the colony for 5 days before any experiment. In behavioral tests, rats in every group were intermixed during the observation (10:00 h and 14:00 h) and the observers were unaware of the treatment
conditions. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Publication No. 8523, revised 1985), as approved by the Nanjing Medical University and Wenzhou
Medical University Committee on Animal Care and Use.
2.2. Drugs
Trans-resveratrol and imipramine hydrochloride (IMI) were purchased from
Sigma Chemical Co. (USA). Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose was provided by the
Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology (China). For oral administration
(via gavage, i.g.), trans-resveratrol was dissolved in 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl
cellulose. For intraperitoneal injection, imipramine was dissolved in redistilled
water.

3. Experimental design
3.1. Experiment 1#
Ninety-six rats totally were divided into six groups for two sets
of study (16 rats/group for experiment 1# and 2#, 6 groups). In this
experiment 1# (Fig. 1A), forty-eight rats were divided into six
groups (n ¼ 8 for each group, 6 groups) randomly: “Sham” (without
MCAO and vehicle treated only); “MCAO” (2 h occlusion followed
by 22 h reperfusion and vehicle treated); “MCAO þ RES” (with
MCAO and 10, 20, 40 mg/kg trans-resveratrol treated).
“MCAO þ IMI” (with MCAO and 10 mg/kg imipramine treated).
Trans-resveratrol, imipramine or equal volumes of vehicle were
given for 7 consecutive days before MCAO surgery. On day 7, rats
were subjected to MCAO 30 min before resveratrol treatment. On
day 8, 30 min after RES, Vehicle or IMI treatment (22 h after occlusion), the rats were assessed for depressive-like behaviors (sucrose preference test), neurological scores and then sacriﬁced for
examining cerebral infarct volume.
3.2. Experiment 2#
Another 48 rats (n ¼ 8 for each group, six groups) were treated
as the same method as the experiment 1#. On day 7, rats were
subjected to MCAO. RES, imipramine or equal volumes of vehicle
were given once per day for 7 days prior to the MCAO surgery, and
continued to give up to 21 days. On day 20th, the neurological
scores and the sucrose preference tests were measured. On day
21st, the rats were assessed for forced swimming and locomotor
activity tests before they were sacriﬁced (Fig. 1B). All the tests were
taken 30 min after drug treatment. The adrenal glands and brain
tissues, such as the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus,
were separated.
4. Surgery
Focal cerebral ischemia was produced by MCAO procedure as
described by Longa et al. (1989) with minor modiﬁcations (Longa
et al., 1989). Rats were food deprived for approximately 16 h prior
to unilateral transient intraluminal right MCAO according to standard procedures. Rats were anesthetized with an appropriate
anesthetic (Ryan et al., 2006). Body temperature of the rat was
maintained at 36.5  C ± 0.5  C during surgery with a heating plate.
The fur was surrounded with an appropriate agent (e.g. 70% ethyl
alcohol) and the skin was disinfected. To perform transient brain
ischemia, a midline neck incision was made and the soft tissues
were pulled apart. The right common carotid artery (LCCA) was
dissected being free from the surrounding nerves (without harming
the vagal nerve) carefully and a ligature was made using 6.0 strings.
The external carotid artery (LECA) was then separated and a second
knot was made. The right internal carotid artery (LICA) was clipped
using a micro vascular clip. Then came the crucial step: cut a small
hole in LECA before it bifurcated to the LCCA and the LICA, and a
monoﬁlament (0.26 mm in diameter) (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co.
Ltd., Beijing, China) was then introduced into the LICA, until it
stopped at the clip. Close the LECA with the third knot to ﬁx the
ﬁlament in position and open the clipped artery. If the reperfusion
is intended, the time of occlusion can vary from 15 to 120 min. In
our experiment, rats stayed for 120 min occlusion in a heated cage.
Meanwhile, the wound could be closed with a small suture clip.
Afterwards the knot on the LCCA was opened and the ﬁlament
withdrawn. For the ﬁnal step, the skin was sutured and the rat was
kept in a heated cage for 2 h to control its body temperature (Engel
et al., 2011).

test. NS, neurological scores; SPT, Sucrose preference test; FST, forced-swim test; LA, locomotor activity; SAC, sacriﬁce.

5. Measurement of the neurological score
The neurological score was measured after 22 h and 14 days
of reperfusion. The severity of neurological deﬁcit was scored
according to the method of Longa et al. (1989) with minor
modiﬁcation (Lin et al., 2013). Neurological deﬁcit were scored
on a 5-point scale as follows: no apparent neurological
deﬁcits ¼ 0; contralateral forelimb ﬂexion ¼ 1; decreased resistance to lateral push ¼ 2; spontaneous movement in all directions and contralateral circling when pulled by tail ¼ 3;
spontaneous circling ¼ 4.
6. Measurement of the infarct volume
22 h after reperfusion, the animals were euthanized by chloral
hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.), and the brains were rapidly removed and
frozen at 20  C for 10 min. The forebrains were cut into ﬁve coronal sections (2 mm thick), the sections were stained by incubating
them in a solution of 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC,
SigmaeAldrich) at 37  C for 30 min, followed by 10% paraformaldehyde overnight, The infarct area of each TTC-stained section was measured using a computerized image analysis system
(Image J software) (Bai et al., 2010). The total infarct volume was
calculated by summing the volumes of the sections, and the ratio of
infarct volume was calculated as follows: the infarct volume/total
volume.
7. Sucrose preference test
The sucrose preference test was carried out based on the previous description (Yu et al., 2013) with minor modiﬁcation. The rats
were food and water deprived for 14 h prior to the start of this
experiment. During the test, rats were exposed to both the test
solution (1% sucrose) and water for a 24 h period. The sucrose

preference was calculated as the ratio of the consumed sucrose
solution to the total amount of liquid consumed.
8. Forced swimming test
Animals were individually placed in a plastic cylinder (45 cm
high  20 cm diameter) ﬁlled with water (22e23  C; 30 cm in
depth), allowing for free swimming. There was a 15-min pretest
followed 24 h later by a 5-min test. A rat was judged to be immobile
when it ceased struggling and remained ﬂoating motionless in the
water, making only small movements necessary to keep its head
above water. The immobility time was recorded during the 5-min
testing period (Xu et al., 2005).
9. Locomotor activity
The assessment of locomotor activity was carried out on mice
according to the previous method (Li et al., 2014). Brieﬂy, the
locomotor activity of the mice was measured by an ambulometer
with four activity chambers (JZZ98, Institute of Materia Medica,
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, China). Mice were placed
in the chambers and their paws contacted or disconnected the
active bars producing random conﬁgurations that were converted into pulses. The pulses, which were proportional to the
locomotor activity of the mice, were automatically recorded as
the cumulative total counts of motor activity. Mice were placed
in test chambers, 15 min prior to the evaluation for acclimatization and then locomotion counts were recorded for a period of
5 min.
10. The adrenal glands index
On day 21, adrenal glands were quickly removed after rats
sacriﬁced, and the weight was measured. The adrenal glands index

450

C. Pang et al. / Neuropharmacology 97 (2015) 447e456

was calculated as follows: the weight of the adrenal glands/the
weight of rat (Rubin et al., 1996).
11. Western blotting
The frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus were
dissected and stored at 80  C until analysis after rats sacriﬁced. All
the tissues were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA buffer containing
0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride and assessed for expression of
CRF, GR and BNDF proteins. Samples (50 mg protein each) were
separated using SDS-PAGE before transferring to nitrocellulose
membranes, nonspeciﬁc bindings were blocked in blocking buffer
for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, membranes were
subsequently incubated with rabbit anti-CRF (1:10,000; Abcam,
HK), rabbit anti-GR (1:50,000; Abcam, CA), rabbit anti-BDNF

(1:1000; Abcam, HK) and rabbit anti-b-actin antibodies (1:1000;
Cell signaling, MA) at 4  C overnight. The membranes were then
incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:10,000; Millipore, CA)
for 60 min. The detection and quantiﬁcation of speciﬁc bands were
performed using a ﬂuorescence scanner and ‘Image-Pro’ software.
Band stripping was carried out by incubating the membranes with
stripping buffer for 15 min (Zhang et al., 2013).
12. Date analysis
Results were expressed as the mean ± standard error of the
mean (S.E.M.). All data were analyzed statistically using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a post hoc Dunnett's
test. Difference with p < 0.05 were considered as statistically
signiﬁcant.

13. Results
13.1. The effects of trans-resveratrol on the infarct volume and
neurological scores
Fig. 2A shows the typical morphological characteristics of the
brain sections of each group after 2% TTC staining, which
revealed an extensive pale infarct area in the brain sections from
rats in the MCAO group. The infarct volume and neurological
scores were evaluated in the absence or presence of transresveratrol after a reperfusion period of 22 h (experiment 1#) or
14 days (experiment 2#). The observation of cerebral histomorphology suggested the signiﬁcant ischemic injury (increased
white color area) in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobe in the
vehicle-treated MCAO rats in comparison with the vehicletreated sham group (p < 0.001), which was found 22 h after
MCAO. This pathogenic change was reversed by treatment with
trans-resveratrol at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg via gavage
[F(4,32) ¼ 17.68, p < 0.001] (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, this detrimental effect induced by MCAO was not signiﬁcant 14 days after
surgery, and the protective effects of trans-resveratrol were also
not signiﬁcant.
As shown in Table 1, animals in the MCAO group displayed
characteristics of ischemia, with higher neurological scores than
the vehicle-treated sham group (p < 0.001). The average neurologic
score in the MCAO group was signiﬁcantly higher than vehicletreated sham group (p < 0.01). However, this abnormal neurologic score was decreased by resveratrol at dose of RES at 40 mg/kg,
from 2.75 ± 0.25 to 1.50 ± 0.29 (p < 0.001). This effect was only
observed 22 h after surgery, but not 14 days after surgery. Imipramine at the dose of 10 mg/kg was not shown to affect the infarction
volume and neurological score when compared to the vehicletreated MCAO group, whatever the assays were performed (22 h
or 14 days after surgery).
13.2. The effects of trans-resveratrol on sucrose consumption in
sucrose preference test
Fig. 3A represents that vehicle-treated MCAO rats did not show
any difference in preference for sucrose consumption 22 h after
surgery; while trans-resveratrol also did not show any inﬂuence on
sucrose consumption at this time point (Experiment 1#). However,
these rats signiﬁcantly decreased the sucrose preference 13 days
after ischemia-reperfusion in comparison with the vehicle-treated
sham group as shown in Fig. 3B (p < 0.01; Experiment 2#)).
Treatment with trans-resveratrol at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg ((i.g.)
reversed the behavior abnormalities, i.e. increased in the ratio of
the sucrose solution to the total liquid consumed [F(4,32) ¼ 6.414,
p < 0.05; p < 0.01]. The classical antidepressant imipramine at
10 mg/kg (i.p.) was shown to increase the sucrose consumption
signiﬁcantly (p < 0.01).

Fig. 3. The effects of trans-resveratrol on the sucrose consumption 22 h (A) and 13
days (B) after MCAO. Values are the mean ± S.E.M. with 8 rats in each group. Data
analysis was performed using Dunnett's t-test. ##p < 0.01 vs. the vehicle-treated sham
group; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 vs. the vehicle-treated MCAO group.

13.3. The effects of trans-resveratrol on the immobility time in the
forced swimming test
In the experiment 2#, the effects of trans-resveratrol on the
immobility time was evaluated in the forced swimming test.
Compared to the vehicle-treated sham group, the immobility time
of vehicle-treated MCAO rats was increased signiﬁcantly (p < 0.001;
Fig. 4). Trans-resveratrol at the doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg
induced a signiﬁcant decrease in immobility time in a dosedependent manner, compared to the vehicle-treated MCAO rats
[F(4,32) ¼ 13.31, p < 0.001]. Similar results were also observed for
treatment with imipramine at dose of 10 mg/kg (p < 0.001).
Interestingly, the trans-resveratrol treatment at doses that signiﬁcantly reduced immobility response did not affect the locomotor
activity as shown in Fig. 5.

to the vehicle-treated sham group (p < 0.01; Table 2). This abnormality in the adrenal gland index was reversed by transresveratrol treatment at the dose of 40 mg/kg (p < 0.01). Imipramine (10 mg/kg) also was shown to have effect on adrenal gland
index.

13.4. The effects of trans-resveratrol on the adrenal gland index
In the experiment 2#, an increase in the adrenal gland index
was observed in the vehicle-treated MCAO rats when compared

Immuno-blot analysis demonstrated that CRF and GR were
differently expressed in the brain regions that are related to
emotional changes after MCAO surgery (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7). CRF
expression was found to increase in the frontal cortex and hippocampus 14 days after surgery (p < 0.01; p < 0.01; p < 0.001), while
GR level was decreased in these two brain regions (p < 0.001;
p < 0.001). Both CRF and GR expression were increased in the hypothalamus 14 days after surgery (p < 0.01; p < 0.01). However, it
was signiﬁcantly different for the expression of these two proteins
after treatment with trans-resveratrol. The MCAO-induced CRF
expression in these three brain regions was reversed by treatment
with high doses of trans-resveratrol at 20 and 40 mg/kg (i.g.)
(p < 0.01; p < 0.001); the decreased GR expression both in the

frontal cortex and hippocampus was also reversed by transresveratrol treatment at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg (p < 0.01;
p < 0.001); while the increased GR level in the hypothalamus was
shown to decrease after higher dose of trans-resveratrol treatment
at 40 mg/kg (p < 0.05). Imipramine at dose of 10 mg/kg (i.p.) was
found to have the similar effects.
13.6. The effects of trans-resveratrol on the brain derived
neurotrophic factor expression
The immune-blot analysis demonstrated that BDNF expression
was decreased in all of three brain regions, the frontal cortex,
hippocampus and hypothalamus, fourteen days after MCAO surgery (p < 0.01; p < 0.001; p < 0.01; Fig. 8). The reduction was
ameliorated by treatment with trans-resveratrol at doses of 20 or
40 mg/kg (i.g.) [F(4,32) ¼ 10.21, p < 0.05; p < 0.01; p < 0.01] and
imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) (p < 0.01; p < 0.01; p < 0.01) when
compared to the vehicle-treated MCAO group.
14. Discussion
Post-stroke depression is among the most frequent psychological sequela after stroke that along with oxidative stress, activation
of the hypothalamusepituitaryeadrenal (HPA) axis and neuronal
injury (Li et al., 2014). Extensive research has revealed the role of
oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion
(Yaidikar et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2014). While increasing evidence of current work found that the CRF and GR systems are
mainly distributed in the limbic system, which are the trigger factors to induce excessive stress response in the HPA axis in the
process of PSD (Li et al., 2014). In the present study, the middle
cerebral artery ischemia-reperfusion model was used to induce
ischemic brain injury in rats. The signiﬁcant ischemia was observed

in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobe and the neurological
injury was signiﬁcant 22 h after MCAO. No signiﬁcant depressivelike behaviors were found at this time point. However, MCAOinduced decrease in the sucrose consumption and increase in the
immobility time in the forced swimming test were signiﬁcant 14
days after ischemia-reperfusion surgery, which indicate that the
depressive-like behaviors are the delayed effect of MCAO (Globus
et al., 1989). Interestingly, as one of the polyphenols, trans-resveratrol protected rats against MCAO-induced above-mentioned histological and behavioral changes, i.e. the increased neurological
score, the decreased sucrose consumption and the prolonged
immobility time induced by MCAO were reversed by treatment
with different doses of trans-resveratrol. It was not surprising that
imipramine produced antidepressant-like effects in the sucrose
preference and forced swimming tests as a positive antidepressant
although it did not show to ameliorate the neurologic injury 22 h
after surgery. In addition to the change in adrenal gland index of
MCAO rats, the signiﬁcant increase in CRF expression in three brain
regions were observed. However, GR expression was found to increase in the hypothalamus, but it was reduced in the hippocampus
and frontal cortex of MCAO mice. Treatment with trans-resveratrol
reversed these detrimental effects induced by MCAO. The protective effect of trans-resveratrol on PSD was reﬂected by reversing the
decreased brain BDNF expression induced by MCAO.
Stroke promotes inﬂammatory response in older individuals
that leads to HPA axis dysfunction and depressive symptoms (PopaWagner et al., 2014; Fenn et al., 2013). Clinical evidence suggests
that 34% of elderly patients with acute stroke have been shown
depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments (Linden et al.,
2007). The middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion
model has been widely used for experimental study on pathological
nature of stroke lesions and the neuroprotective action of drugs.
The present ﬁnding supported that some polyphenols such as

curcumin and trans-resveratrol are potent to protect neurons
against ischemia-induced cerebral infarct and neurological
dysfunction (Yousuf et al., 2009;). Our results showed that transresveratrol protected neurons against MCAO-induced ischemia
22 h after surgery. This ischemic stroke did not develop, only a
trend towards a decrease in the brain infarct volume and neurological deﬁcits, was found 14 days after ischemia-reperfusion based
on the results from vehicle-treated MCAO rats in comparison with
the vehicle-treated sham group, suggesting the capability of
autoregulation. This ﬁnding was consistent with the previous
study, which suggested the neurological score is improved over
time after MCAO (Winter et al., 2005). However, the depressive-like
behaviors were signiﬁcant 14 days after MCAO, reﬂected in the
results of two tasks, forced swimming and sucrose consumption
tests. The evidence that no clear depressive-like behaviors occur 2
days after MCAO supports this ﬁnding although the plasma
norepinephrine can be found abnormal in the hours after brain
stroke (Globus et al., 1989). Moreover, the early emotional changes
are only seen 7 days after MCAO based on the previous study
(Deplanque et al., 2011).
To our knowledge, few researches are involved in the consequence of post-cerebral ischemia stroke on emotional abnormalities such as depression, particularly regarding treatment issues
(Bantsiele et al., 2009). The present study investigated whether a
transient cerebral ischemia-reperfusion modiﬁed rats behaviors
related to depression and antidepressant drug effects. Extending
our previous studies (Yu et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2013), the recent
results showed that chronic administration of trans-resveratrol at
20 and 40 mg/kg for 21 days (7 days pre-MCAO and continue to
treat for another 14 days post-MCAO) resulted in a decrease in the
immobility time in the forced swimming test and an increase in
sucrose consumption, indicating the signiﬁcant antidepressant-like
effects. The classical antidepressant imipramine showed the similar
behavioral effects 14 days after MCAO although it did not change
the brain ischemia and neurological deﬁcits 22 h after MCAO

surgery. Indeed, the previous work suggested that no correlation is
found between the degree of brain ischemia and depressive-like
behaviors 1 week or 2 weeks after MCAO in animals (Deplanque
et al., 2011), which indicates that the different mechanism may
be involved in the brain ischemic injury and emotional abnormalities. It is noted that the present study suggested resveratrol produced antidepressant-like effects, but did not induce changes in
motor activity in MCAO mice, which is consistent with the previous
study that suggested the absence of a clear link between spontaneous motor activity and antidepressant action (Deplanque et al.,
2011; Bourin et al., 2001). However, it is not clear if the neuroprotective effects of trans-resveratrol are relevant to its action on
post stroke depression.
Cerebral ischemia inﬂuences the neuroendocrine system that
activates the HPA axis, which could contribute to behavioral impairments (de la Tremblaye et al., 2014). Increasing CRF and
glucocorticoid levels in discrete brain regions after stroke may
result in decreased efﬁciency of the negative feedback loop between cortisol and the hypothalamus (Olsson et al., 1992). It deserves to note that dysregulation of the HPA axis is a key feature of
depression (Bao et al., 2008; Risch et al., 2009; Wang, 2005;
Pariante and Lightman, 2008; Kessler et al., 2010). A mass of
research indicates that those diagnosed with depression after
stroke have higher levels of serum glucocorticoid and excessive CRF
releasing in the brain, which can be reversed by treatment with
some antidepressants (Kronenberg et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013).
The increased ratio of the weight of adrenal gland to the body
weight is usually considered as an index of adrenal gland lesion
because of high levels of serum corticosterone after ischemia (de la
Tremblaye et al., 2014). The present study found that MCAO rats
showed the adrenal gland hyperplasia as the ratio of the adrenal
gland weight to the body weight was increased. Moreover, CRF
expression in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus
was found to increase in the MCAO rats. All these parameters were
reversed by treatment with high doses of trans-resveratrol,

C. Pang et al. / Neuropharmacology 97 (2015) 447e456

indicating the improvement of neuroendocrine system. Another
interesting result was that the brain-region speciﬁc alterations on
GR expression in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus of stroke rats. These are agreement with the previous studies
that suggested a PSD related GR increasing in the hypothalamus
and a GR decreasing in the hippocampus (Mamalaki et al., 1992; de
la Tremblaye et al., 2014). The latter likely triggers a spontaneously
negative regulation in the HPA axis. The differential modulation of
GR expression in these three brain regions after treatment with
trans-resveratrol may indicate its neuroprotective and
antidepressant-like effects by modulating neuroendocrine and HPA
axis dysfunction during cerebral ischemia. This was further
conﬁrmed by the fact that trans-resveratrol reversed MCAOinduced decrease in the BDNF expression. As the most abundant
neurotrophic factor, BDNF plays an important role in the regulation
of cell survival and neurotransmission (Kuipers and Bramham,
2006). In the rat hippocampus and other brain regions, BDNF is
thought to be involved in brain ischemia and PSD (Thome et al.,
2000). BDNF also regulates nerve cell plasticity and development,
which may be achieved through promoting cell survival and
reducing neuronal damage (Takahashi et al., 1999; Banasr et al.,
2004). The results that trans-resveratrol increased BDNF expression in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus of MCAO
rats suggested that BDNF expression may protect the neurons
against cerebral ischemia, and shed light on the mechanism by
which trans-resveratrol acts at the psycho-neuroendocrine levels,
particularly as a modulator of the HPA axis.
Taken together, the present study suggests that trans-resveratrol
attenuates brain ischemic injury and shows a certain neuroprotective properties, which may involve in its antidepressant-like
effect against PSD through modulate the HPA axis. These results
provide theoretical support for trans-resveratrol in the treatment of
PSD for the ﬁrst time. Further investigation is needed to clarify the
exact mechanism of trans-resveratrol's action on post stroke
depression disorders.
