demonstrates that Lrrﬁp1 activates b-catenin, Akt, and
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) proteins in
astrocytes and positively regulates the expression of the
excitatory amino acid transporter subtype 2 (GLT-1). Our
ﬁndings point to Lrrﬁp1 as a key brain protein that regulates

Abstract—Leucine-rich repeat in Flightless-1 interaction
protein 1 (Lrrﬁp1) is an up-regulated protein after cerebral
ischemia whose precise role in the brain both in healthy
and ischemic conditions is unclear. Diﬀerent Lrrﬁp1 isoforms with distinct roles have been reported in human and
mouse species. The present study aimed to analyze the
Lrrﬁp1 transcriptional variants expressed in rat cortex, to
characterize their expression patterns and subcellular location after ischemia, and to deﬁne their putative role in the
brain. Five transcripts were identiﬁed and three of them
(Lrrﬁp1, CRA_g and CRA_a0 (Fli-I leucine-rich repeat associated protein 1 – Flap-1)) were analyzed by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). All the transcripts
were up-regulated and showed diﬀerential expression patterns after in vivo and in vitro ischemia models. The main
isoform, Lrrﬁp1, was found to be up-regulated from the
acute to the late phases of ischemia in the cytoplasm of

INTRODUCTION
Ischemic stroke results from a reduction in cerebral blood
ﬂow triggering a cascade of cellular and molecular events
that evolve over time and in space. Excitotoxicity is well
established as an important trigger and executioner of
tissue damage following cerebral ischemia, leading to
necrosis, apoptosis and the expression of genes that
initiate post-ischemic inﬂammation events (Dirnagl et al.,
1999).
Adopting
the
hypothesis
of
individual
susceptibility to excitotoxic damage due to impaired
glutamate uptake, a functional polymorphism was
identiﬁed in the promoter of the glutamate transporter
excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2) gene that
creates a new binding site for the repressor transcription
factor GC-binding factor 2 (GCF2). Our data conﬁrmed
the eﬀective repression of the mutant promoter and
provided the ﬁrst evidence of GCF2 overexpression in
ischemic rat brain (Mallolas et al., 2006).
The GC-binding factor 2/Leucine-rich repeat in
Flightless-1 interaction protein 1 (GCF2/LRRFIP1) gene
belongs to a small family of proteins whose function and
regulation has been poorly studied. LRRFIP1 is
ubiquitously expressed (Fong and de Couet, 1999;
Rikiyama et al., 2003) and localized both in the nucleus
and cytoplasm, depending on the cell line and the
conditions studied (Wilson et al., 1998; Rikiyama et al.,
2003; Arakawa et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010; Ohtsuka
et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2012). The LRRFIP1 gene
encodes diﬀerent splice isoforms in human and mouse
species that seem to be diﬀerentially regulated (Liu and
Yin, 1998; Reed et al., 1998; Fong and de Couet, 1999;
Rikiyama et al., 2003; Suriano et al., 2005). Five human
LRRFIP1 isoforms have been reported and three of

them, namely, GCF2, LRRFIP1 and TAR RNA interacting
protein (TRIP), have been described as functioning,
respectively, as (1) a transcriptional repressor (Reed
et al., 1998; Khachigian et al., 1999; Eden et al., 2001;
Suriano et al., 2005; Mallolas et al., 2006), (2) a
modulator of the innate immune response (Arakawa
et al., 2010; Bagashev et al., 2010), and (3) an RNAbinding protein and possible regulator of mRNA
translation (Wilson et al., 1998; Fong and de Couet,
1999). LRRFIP1 has been identiﬁed as one of the
cancer-associated genes (Sjoblom et al., 2006) which
promotes cell invasion and metastasis (Arakawa et al.,
2010; Ohtsuka et al., 2011; Ariake et al., 2012). In
addition, LRRFIP1 isoforms also interact with other
proteins, such as ﬂightless-I (Fli-I), an actin-binding
protein (Liu and Yin, 1998; Wilson et al., 1998; Fong and
de Couet, 1999), dishevelled (Dvl), a key molecule in the
Wnt signaling cascade (Goodall et al., 2010; Ohtsuka
et al., 2011), Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), an innate sensor
of viral infection (Bagashev et al., 2010) and Drebrin 1
(DBN1), which is involved in the formation of dendritic
spines and the stabilization of tight junctions (Majoul
et al., 2007; Goodall et al., 2010). With regard to the
mouse isoforms, three diﬀerent proteins have been
reported, two of which, Fli-I leucine-rich repeat
associated protein 1 (Flap-1) and Lrrﬁp1, have been
studied. The ﬁrst one has been described as interacting
with Fli-I and myeloid diﬀerentiation factor 88 (Myd88)
and to positively regulate TLR immune response and
nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-jB) activation through Myd88
interaction (Liu and Yin, 1998; Reed et al., 1998; Dai
et al., 2009; Bagashev et al., 2010). On the other hand,
Lrrﬁp1 has been described as an intracellular sensor of
pathogens that regulates the innate immune response via
a b-catenin-dependent pathway (Yang et al., 2010). Both
Flap-1 and Lrrﬁp1 promote b-catenin activation, and
Lrrﬁp1 induces the phosphorylation of b-catenin at
Ser552 (Lee and Stallcup, 2006; Yang et al., 2010).
Therefore, LRRFIP1 shows itself to be an interesting
gene through which diﬀerent isoforms may modulate
multiple signaling pathways involved in stroke damage
and
recovery,
such
as
TLR
signaling
in
neuroinﬂammation and ischemic brain injury (Caso et al.,
2007) and b-catenin signaling in stroke-induced
neurogenesis (Lei et al., 2008).
The overexpression of Lrrﬁp1 in cerebral ischemia has
been described earlier (Mallolas et al., 2006). The present
study aims to identify and describe the transcriptional
variants of Lrrﬁp1 in rat cerebral cortex, focusing on the
ischemic area, in order to describe their expression
patterns in ischemic injury and determine the putative
role of this protein in the brain through functional studies
in rat astrocyte cultures.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All procedures were approved by the Committee of
Animal Care of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid,
in accordance with European Union regulations (86/609/
CEE) and Spanish legislation (RD223/88).
The protocols followed in the use of commercial kits
were always as per the manufacturers’ instructions.

Bioinformatics
Novel Lrrﬁp1 rat variants were identiﬁed using Ensembl
gene predictions (ENSRNOG00000019892) and related
sequences of Entrez Gen at NCBI (National Center for
Biotechnology Information) (GeneID: 367314). Ensembl
gene predictions are based on experimental evidence
from protein and/or near-full-length cDNA available from
public sequence databases. ‘‘Ensembl known genes’’
are predicted transcripts that have been mapped to
full-length or near-full-length protein sequences already
available in the public sequence species-speciﬁc
database entries from manually curated UniProt/
Swiss-Prot, partially manually curated RefSeq and
UniProt/TrEMBL databases. Predictions of ‘‘Ensembl
novel genes’’ are based on the similarity to protein or
cDNA sequences from related species (http://
www.ensembl.org/index.html) (Flicek et al., 2012). The
degree of homology between the transcripts and
isoforms identiﬁed, the domains and features described
for Lrrﬁp1 and versus mouse and human isoforms were
determined using Clustalw2. Sequence data were also
aligned against the candidate transcripts using this
software to conﬁrm the sequence of the fragments
ampliﬁed with each polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and to identify the unexpected amplicons
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2/index.html).
The
Translate tool (http://web.expasy.org/translate/) and the
Compute
pI/Mw
tool
(http://www.expasy.ch/tools/
pi_tool.html) from Expasy (Expert Protein Analysis
System) were used to obtain the exact number of
aminoacids and the theoretical molecular masses of the
Lrrﬁp1 isoforms detected. Primer 3 software was used
for PCR primers design (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/)
(Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000). The Allen Mouse Brain
Atlas was used to analyze the expression levels and
spatial distribution of the orthologs of the rLrrﬁp1,
CRA_a0 and CRA_g transcripts in the mouse brain. The
Brain Explorer 2 software was used for viewing the
gene expression data obtained by in situ hybridization
(ISH) (http://mouse.brain-map.org/) (Lein et al., 2007).
Clustalw2 software was used to determine which
transcript was analyzed in each experiment of the atlas.
Animals
Adult male Fischer rats weighing 250–300 g were used in
this study. Rats were housed individually under standard
conditions of temperature and humidity and were given
a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water.
Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO).
Rats were anesthetized with isoﬂurane 1.5–2% in a
mixture of 70% nitrogen/30% oxygen. Permanent focal
cerebral ischemia was induced by ligature of the left
common carotid artery (CCA) followed by occlusion of
the ipsilateral distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) by
electrocoagulation as previously described (Gubern
et al., 2009). In this model, the infarct was limited to the
parietal and sensory-motor cortex. The characteristic
changes of ischemic necrosis are mainly limited to the
cortex and the subcortical structures and basal ganglia

50

are usually spared (Pereira et al., 2005). Large infarcts
were reproducibly generated in the left MCA territory
24 h after MCA occlusion.
Experimental groups. Groups were randomized to
eliminate bias and the investigator was blinded to the
time to tissue collection. Brains were removed and
cortical ischemic tissue around the MCA territory was
collected at 0.5, 2, 6, 24 and 72 h, 7 and 14 days after
artery occlusion (n = 3–5 in each group). Likewise,
control samples from healthy animals were also
collected. Samples were quickly frozen at 80 °C until
RNA and protein isolation and determination were
undertaken.

Rat astrocyte cultures
Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from neonatal
(P0–P2) Wistar rat cortex, as previously described
(Hurtado et al., 2005), or obtained from Innoprot (Derio,
Bizkaia, ES). Cells present in the culture were shown to
be astrocytes (94 ± 5%) after characterization by ﬂow
cytometry using a primary speciﬁc anti-glial ﬁbrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) antibody (1:100 dilution;
Chemicon, Temecula, CA, US).
Exposure of astrocyte culture to oxygen–glucose
deprivation (OGD). Astrocyte cultures were exposed to
OGD as previously described (Gubern et al., 2009).
Culture medium was replaced by a solution containing
(in mM) NaCl (130), KCl (5.4), CaCl2 (1.8), NaHCO3
(26), MgCl2 (0.8), NaH2PO4 (1.18) and 2% FS bubbled
with 95% N2/5% CO2 for OGD cells (OGD solution).
OGD cells were transferred to an anaerobic chamber
(Forma Scientiﬁc, Hucoa Erloss, ES) containing a gas
mixture of 95% N2/5% CO2 and humidiﬁed at 37 °C, and
maintained at a constant pressure of 0.15 bar. Time of
exposure to OGD was 180 min. OGD was terminated by
replacing the exposure medium with oxygenated MEM
containing 0.6% glucose, 0.029% glutamine, 50 I.U./ml
penicillin, 50 Ag/ml streptomycin, 10% FS (reperfusion
medium) and returned to the normoxic incubator.
Control cultures in a solution identical to OGD solution
except that it contained glucose (33 mM; control
solution) were kept in the normoxic incubator for the
same time period as the OGD, and then incubation
solution was replaced with the reperfusion buﬀer.
Cultures were returned to the normoxic incubator until
the end of the experiment. Two independent
experiments were performed.
Experimental groups. Astrocyte samples were
collected from controls and OGD groups at 0, 0.5, 2, 6
and 24 h after reperfusion (n = 3 in each group).
Astrocytes were collected and frozen at 80 °C until
protein and RNA isolation was undertaken. Control
and OGD-exposed astrocytes were ﬁxed in 4%
p-formaldehyde 24 h after reperfusion to perform
immunocytoﬂuorescence.

RNA extraction, quantiﬁcation and reverse
transcription
RNA was isolated from cerebral cortex and astrocyte
cultures using the RNeasyÒ Lipid Tissue Mini Kit and
the RNeasyÒ Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, DE), respectively.
Spectrophotometric RNA quantiﬁcation and RT were
performed as previously described (Gubern et al., 2009,
2013). Two independent RT reactions were performed
for all samples.
PCR and sequence analysis
Diﬀerent combinations of primers (Table 1) were used to
analyze the expression of the candidate variants in
cerebral cortex at control and 24 h post-MCAO. The
PCR reaction was conducted with the initial predenaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35
cycles of denaturing at 95 °C, and annealing and
extension at 72 °C, and then a ﬁnal extension step at
72 °C for either 5 or 30 min. The temperature of the
annealing step was speciﬁc for each primer pair
(Table 1). Fifteen microliters of the ampliﬁcation
products were visualized in a 1% or 2% agarose gel
containing ethidium bromide by electrophoresis.
Expected and unexpected PCR products were
automatically sequenced in the ABI PRISMÒ 310
Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
US) after performing the sequencing reaction using the
BigDyeÒ Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied
Biosystems). The ampliﬁcation reactions were puriﬁed
before sequencing using the ExoSAP-IT kit (USB
Corporation, Cleveland, OH, US) and the GFX PCR
DNA and Gel Band Puriﬁcation kit (GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, UK) was used for the puriﬁcation of agarose
gel bands when more than one amplicon was obtained
in the ampliﬁcation reaction.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
Speciﬁc Custom TaqManÒ Gene Expression Assays
(Applied Biosystems) for NM_001014269, CRA_g plus
305-bp amplicon and CRA_a0 transcripts were designed
following the manufacturer’s design guide (sequences of
primers and probes of the assays are available upon
request). The high homology of the sequences hindered
the design of speciﬁc assays for CRA_h0 and CRA_i
variants. The Gene Expression Assay Rn00568080_m1
was used to quantify the mRNA encoding the excitatory
amino acid transporter subtype 2(GLT-1).
qPCR reactions were run in triplicate using the same
amount of cDNA in an ABI PRISMÒ 7000 Instrument
(Applied Biosystems). All the custom assays were found
to have equivalent ampliﬁcation eﬃciencies at almost
100% and, therefore, the expression was obtained using
the 2DDCT method and the diﬀerence of 1 CT is
equivalent to a twofold diﬀerence in the initial template
amount (Yuan et al., 2006). Sdha and Ywhaz were used
as reference genes for cortical samples and Sdha
and Rpl13a for astrocytes samples, as previously
described (Gubern et al., 2009). Hprt and Ywhaz were
validated and used as reference genes for data

normalization of the siRNA experiments. For proper
CRA_a0 quantiﬁcation in cortical samples it was
necessary to preamplify this transcript and the reference
genes using TaqManÒ PreAmp Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). Two independent reverse transcriptions
were tested for each assay. 7000 System software
v1.2.3 (Applied Biosystems) was used for data analysis.
Protein extraction and quantiﬁcation
Brain samples were homogenized by sonication during
10–12 s using a homogenization buﬀer containing a
protease inhibitor cocktail and 0.1% Nonidet P40 (Roche,
Basel, CH). Astrocytes samples (OGD and siRNA
transfected) were homogenized using a lysis buﬀer (Cell
Signalling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, US) with a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics) and
phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF) (1%) and mixed in
a vortex every 5 min during 30 min while being
maintained in ice. Both homogenized samples were then
centrifuged (13,000g during 10 min, at 4 °C) and the
supernatant (protein) was collected. Protein quantiﬁcation
was performed using a Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, US) based on the Bradford method.
Western blot analysis
Sixty micrograms of cortical homogenates and 5 lg of
astrocyte homogenates were loaded and size-separated
in 7% or 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) (90 mA), according to
protein molecular weights. Proteins were blotted onto a
PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare) and incubated with
the speciﬁc primary antibody against Lrrﬁp1 (sc-68386;
1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA,
US), which only recognizes the main Lrrﬁp1 isoform

1:1000; Cell Signalling Technology) and GLT-1
(ab41621; 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). b-actin was
used as the loading control. Immunoreactive bands
were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Waltham, MA, US) or Immobilon Western (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, US). Speciﬁc signals were quantiﬁed with
densitometry analysis software (Kodak MI 5.0 SE
version, Rochester, NY, US).
Lrrﬁp1 immunohistoﬂuorescence
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats and control rats (n = 2
in each group) were anesthetized with sodium
pentobarbital and brains were ﬁxed and processed to
cryoprotection as previously described (Sobrado et al.,
2009). Brains were frozen and a series of 40-lm-thick
coronal sections were cut with a sliding microtome (Leica
SM2000R, Solms, DE) and mounted on glass slides.
Identiﬁcation of the infarcted tissue in the
neocortex was performed by Nissl [0.2% (w/v) Cresyl
Violet] staining of slide-mounted coronal sections.

sections
were

Brieﬂy,
sections
were
preincubated with 0.3% Triton X-100 and with 5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate buﬀered
saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After this
time, sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with

53

C. Gubern et al. / Neuroscience 268 (2014) 48–65

rabbit polyclonal antibody against Lrrﬁp1 (1:20; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and with mouse monoclonal
antibody against neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (1:100;
Millipore) or GFAP (1:500; Millipore), as the primary
antibodies. Detection with secondary antibodies was
performed using Alexa FluorÒ 488/594 goat anti-rabbit/
mouse immunoglobulins G (IgGs) (1:40; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, US). After washing, sections were
counterstained for 5 min at room temperature with DAPI
(Invitrogen) before mounting. All brain sections were
processed together. Controls performed at the same
time without primary antibodies showed very low levels
of nonspeciﬁc staining. Image acquisition was
performed in diﬀerent channels for Alexa FluorÒ 488
(pseudo-colored green), Alexa FluorÒ 594 (pseudocolored red) and 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
(pseudo-colored blue) on a BD Pathway 855 Bioimager
System (Becton–Dickinson Biosciences, Franklin Lakes,
NJ, US) in confocal mode using 20 objective (NA 075
Olympus) using the same settings and an adaptor for
glass slides. Five Z sections separated by 2.2-lm steps
were acquired and collapsed into a single stack. Both
acquisition and merging of images were carried out
according to the Recommended Assay Procedure using
BDAttovision software.
Lrrﬁp1 immunocytoﬂuorescence
Astrocytes were seeded at approximately 10,000 cells/
well in 96-well clear bottom imaging tissue culture plates
(Becton–Dickinson Biosciences) optimized for imaging
applications. Cells were ﬁxed with 4% p-formaldehyde in
phosphate buﬀer for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.25%
TritonÒ X-100 in phosphate buﬀer for 10 min and
blocked with 5% BSA in phosphate buﬀer for 30 min, all
at room temperature. Primary antibody staining with
rabbit polyclonal antibody against Lrrﬁp1 (1:50; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and with mouse monoclonal
antibody against GFAP (1:100; Millipore), secondary
antibody staining using Alexa FluorÒ 488/594 goat antirabbit/mouse IgGs (1:40; Invitrogen) and counterstaining
(using DAPI; Invitrogen) were performed following BD
Biosciences protocols. Images were captured in diﬀerent
channels for Alexa FluorÒ 488 (pseudo-colored green),
Alexa FluorÒ 594 (pseudo-colored red) and DAPI
(pseudo-colored blue) on a BD Pathway 855 Bioimager
System (Becton–Dickinson Biosciences) with 40x
objectives (NA 075 Olympus). Merging images were
obtained according to the Recommended Assay
Procedure using BD Attovision software.
Gene silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA)
Rat astrocytes were plated at a density of 3  103 cells/cm2
in 6-well plates, previously coated with poly-L-Lysine
(Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, US), and maintained in
antibiotic-free medium for 24 h. The astrocytes were then
transfected with a mixture containing basal medium,
2.5 ll/well DharmaFECT-1 (Dharmacon, Lafayette,
CO, US) and either 50 nM/well of ON-TARGETplus
Non-Targeting Pool siRNA (D-001810-10; Dharmacon)
(negative control, siCTRL) or of ON-TARGETplus

SMARTpool Lrrﬁp1 siRNA (L-084833-01; Dharmacon)
(siLrrﬁp1). Twenty-four hours after siRNAs transfection,
the medium was replaced by complete astrocyte growth
medium and the culture was maintained until 6 days after
transfection, when the cells were collected and frozen at
80 °C until protein and RNA isolation was undertaken.
The results presented are the mean of at least two
independent experiments.
[3H]-Glutamate uptake
Six days after siRNA transfection [3H]-glutamate uptake
was determined as previously described (Romera et al.,
2004). Brieﬂy, cultures were washed in a control
solution and incubated in a control solution containing
3 lM glutamate and 8 lCi/ml of [3H]-glutamate for 90 s,
a time in which glutamate uptake was found to proceed
linearly with time. In a parallel set of experiments,
cultures were incubated during the same time in a
solution of the same composition but in which Na+ was
equiosmotically substituted by choline. At the end of the
incubation, solution was collected and cells were lysed
by the addition of perchloric acid (0.3 M). [3H]-glutamate
uptake was calculated by subtracting the uptake in the
absence of Na+ from the uptake in its presence and
expressed as a percentage of total [3H]-glutamate. The
results are the mean of three independent experiments.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SEM or as a
percentage of the indicated number of experiments.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s
post hoc analysis or the Student’s unpaired t-test were
used for statistical analysis to compare each group
against the control group mean. When the data were
not normally distributed, the Kruskal–Wallis and the
Mann–Whitney tests were used. p < 0.05 was
considered to be signiﬁcant (⁄p < 0.05, ⁄⁄p < 0.01,
#
p < 0.001). Calculations were performed using the
SPSS software, Version 11.5.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, US).

RESULTS
In silico prediction of novel rat Lrrﬁp1 variants
Sixteen candidate transcript variants were obtained from
Ensembl predictions and NCBI annotations, both
periodically updated (see Experimental procedures for
details) (Table 2). Thirteen candidate transcripts were
taken into account in the ﬁnal analysis (Fig. 1). The
results obtained in the homology analysis of the Lrrﬁp1
transcripts showed that the homology of the 2217-bp
nucleotide sequence of ENSRNOT00000050191 and
CRA_j transcripts to the NCBI reference sequence
(Lrrﬁp1; NM_001014269) was 100%. ENSRNOT00000056683 and CRA_k were shorter than NM_001014269
(2157 and 2094 bp, respectively). Apart from the
absence of exon 1, CRA_k was identical to
NM_001014269. ENSRNOT00000056683 had two
deletions in exon 8, one of 48 bp and another of 12 bp.
The remaining variants showed a degree of homology

54

C. Gubern et al. / Neuroscience 268 (2014) 48–65

with the reference sequence ranging from 75% of CRA_h
to 46% of CRA_a.
At least ﬁve diﬀerent Lrrﬁp1 variants are expressed in
rat cerebral cortex: Lrrﬁp1 (NM_001014269), CRA_i,
CRA_g, CRA_h0 and CRA_a0
Fourteen diﬀerent PCR ampliﬁcations were performed in
order to identify the Lrrﬁp1 variants present in the rat
cerebral cortex. The expected and obtained results in
each PCR ampliﬁcation (PCR A to PCR N) are shown in
Table 1.
Expression of NM_001014269, CRA_i and CRA_g
transcripts were detected in rat brain cortex in control
and ischemic conditions. CRA_a and CRA_h transcripts
were detected with some nucleotide sequence
modiﬁcations and they were renamed as CRA_a0 and
CRA_h0 . CRA_a0 transcript showed a deletion of exon
15 of CRA_a transcript meanwhile CRA_h0 lacked
exons 3 to 5 of CRA_h transcript. Furthermore, six
unexpected bands were detected and sequenced
(Table 1 and Fig. 2A). Fig. 2B summarizes the transcript
variants and the amplicons detected with the fourteen
diﬀerent PCR ampliﬁcations performed.
Characterization of the Lrrﬁp1 isoforms identiﬁed in
rat cerebral cortex
The new Lrrﬁp1 transcripts identiﬁed in the cerebral
cortex (CRA_a0 , CRA_g, CRA_i and CRA_h0 ) coded for
proteins of 627, 428, 404 and 394 amino acids with
molecular masses of 71.2, 48.9, 46.1 and 44.9 kDa,
respectively, both theoretically calculated as described
in Materials and Methods. Table 3 summarizes the
information relating to cDNA and protein of the novel
variants and its homology with the reference Lrrﬁp1
protein (NP_001014291), which consists of 738 amino
acids (83 kDa). The most similar variant was CRA_h0 ,
which had 65% of amino acid identity whereas the new

isoforms identiﬁed shared a high degree of homology
between each other (94–100%, Table 4). Moreover, we
analyzed whether domains and features described in
human and mouse Lrrﬁp1 isoforms were present in the
Lrrﬁp1 rat isoforms identiﬁed and their degree of
homology versus the mouse and human isoforms
reported at NCBI (Table 5). Taking into account all the
following information, the exonic structure of each
transcript and the number of amino acids of each
isoform (Ensembl), we considered that rat Lrrﬁp1
reference protein (NP_001014291) could be the ortholog
of mouse isoform 1, named rLrrﬁp1 henceforth; CRA_a0 ,
the ortholog of mouse Flap-1, as it also contained the
serine-rich region described for this protein, named
rFlap-1 henceforth; CRA_g, the ortholog of mouse
isoform 3; and CRA_h0 , the ortholog of human isoform
2. Only the reference protein Lrrﬁp1 contained the
nuclear localization signal (NLS) (100%) and the RNAbinding domain (80%). These isoforms contained
neither the DNA-binding domain nor the dsRNA-binding
domain. All isoforms contained the sequences of
interaction with Fli-I (LRR-binding region; coiled-coil
domain) (97%) and Dvl (96%) while only the isoform
CRA_a0 harbored the serine-rich region of interaction
with Myd88 (90%). Analysis of the homology of rat
isoforms with human and mouse isoforms showed that
Lrrﬁp1 shared an 84% homology with the mouse
isoform 1; CRA_h0 , CRA_i, CRA_g and CRA_a0 shared
a high degree of homology with the mouse isoform 2,
named Flap-1, the mouse isoform 3 and the human
isoforms 1 and 2 (87–97%), and that none of the
isoforms was similar to human isoforms 3, 4 and 5.

transcript, individually, and of the orthologs of rFlap-1 and
CRA_g (rFlap-1–CRA_g), analyzed together. The results
showed that rLrrﬁp1 and rFlap-1–CRA_g transcripts have
low expression in the brain with diﬀerent spatial
distribution: rLrrﬁp1 is mainly expressed in the cerebral
cortex and rFlap-1–CRA_g is mainly expressed in the
midbrain.
Speciﬁcally, with regard to the cerebrum, rFlap-1–
CRA_g is present in the cerebral cortex and cerebral
nuclei, speciﬁcally in the striatum, while rLrrﬁp1 is only
present in the cerebral cortex. All of these transcripts
are mainly present in the cortical plate of the cerebral
cortex: rFlap-1–CRA_g has low expression in all the
areas of the isocortex while rLrrﬁp1 is only detected at
low levels in the somatomotor, somatosensorial,
gustatory, agranullar insular and retroesplenial areas.
rLrrﬁp1 and rFlap-1–CRA_g are present in the piriform
area of the olfactory areas and in the retrohippocampal
and hippocampal regions, respectively, of the

hippocampal formation. In the brainstem, rLrrﬁp1 is
mainly expressed in the hindbrain at a low level,
speciﬁcally in the medulla, is not expressed in the
interbrain, and has a low level of expression in the
midbrain. However, rFlap-1–CRA_g is mainly expressed
in the midbrain at high levels and has a low level of
expression both in the interbrain, where it is particularly
found in the thalamus, and in the hindbrain, where it is
mainly found in the medulla. Finally, rLrrﬁp1 is nearly
undetectable in the cerebellum while rFlap-1–CRA_g
has medium levels of expression in the cerebellar cortex
and low expression levels in the cerebellar nuclei.
Up-regulated expression patterns of Lrrﬁp1
transcripts and rLrrﬁp1 protein after MCAO
A speciﬁc expression assay design was possible for only
three (rLrrﬁp1, CRA_g and rFlap-1) of the ﬁve transcripts
identiﬁed. Due to the high homology of the exon

architecture of CRA_i and CRA_h0 with the other
transcripts, it was not possible to design speciﬁc
expression assays that would permit individual analysis.
The antibody used only recognized rLrrﬁp1, the reference
Lrrﬁp1 sequence published at NCBI (NM_001014269/
NP_001014291). The speciﬁc assay for CRA_g transcript
quantiﬁed the CRA_g transcript together with the
corresponding transcript of the 305-bp amplicon identiﬁed
with PCR M (Fig. 2A–M). The mean CT values of the
control group obtained for the transcripts were
27.0 ± 0.2 for rLrrﬁp1 and 29.9 ± 0.3 for CRA_g.
The expression proﬁles of each transcript (rLrrﬁp1,
CRA_g and rFlap-1) and of the rLrrﬁp1 protein are shown
in Fig. 3. rLrrﬁp1 mRNA expression increased
signiﬁcantly from 2 h after MCAO (p < 0.001) to a peak
at 24 h (p < 0.01), which was three times greater than
control values. Peak expression was maintained 7 days
after MCAO (p < 0.001 for 72 h and p < 0.05 for
7 days). The expression at 14 days decreased but still
remained above control values (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3A). At
protein level, rLrrﬁp1 was expressed in both control and
ischemic conditions and an rLrrﬁp1 overexpression was
detected at all the times analyzed after MCAO (Fig. 3B).
rLrrﬁp1 gradually increased from 0.5 to 24 h, at which
time it reached its maximum level (fourfold change).
Afterward, from 72 h to 14 days, rLrrﬁp1 protein gradually
decreased without returning to the control level
(p < 0.001 for 6 h; p < 0.01 for 24 and 72 h; p < 0.05 for
7 days). Joint analysis of CRA_g transcript and the
transcript of the 305-bp amplicon identiﬁed showed a
signiﬁcant increase from 30 min to 7 days, with the
highest level being at 6 h (2.4-fold change over control;
p < 0.05 for 30 min, 6 h, 72 h and 7 days; p < 0.001 for
24 h; Fig. 3C). The expression pattern of rFlap-1 variant

57

showed a signiﬁcant increase at 6 and 24 h (2.6 and
2.4-fold changes, respectively, p < 0.001; Fig. 3D).

rLrrﬁp1 protein is up-regulated in cortical neurons
and astrocytes of the peri-infarct area after MCAO
According to the double immunoﬂuorescence staining in
equivalent brain sections in MCA territory, rLrrﬁp1 was
expressed and up-regulated after MCAO in cortical
neurons (NeuN-positive cells) and astrocytes (GFAPpositive cells) (Fig. 4). Control animals showed low
rLrrﬁp1 immunoreactivity in neurons, with a rounded
appearance, and astrocytes (Fig. 4A, E, respectively).
The same was detected in the contralateral brain tissue
of MCAO-exposed animals (Fig. 4D, H). Permanent
MCAO induced an increase in rLrrﬁp1 expression in
soma and neurites mainly in neurons located in the periinfarct area (NeuN-positive, Fig. 4C). Moreover, the
expression of rLrrﬁp1 was also increased in reactive
astroglial cells in the core and mostly in peri-infarct area
(GFAP-positive, Fig. 4F, G) after ischemia. No
colocalization with the nuclear staining, DAPI, was
observed in these cells. Staining of cellular marker of
reactive astrocytes was very low in control animals and
in the contralateral hemisphere of MCAO-exposed
animals (Fig. 4E, H, respectively).

Lrrﬁp1 expression increases after OGD in cultured
astrocytes and rLrrﬁp1 protein is localized in the
cytoplasm
Since our previous data pointed to astrocytes as a major
target of Lrrﬁp1 actions (Mallolas et al., 2006), we focused
on the analysis of the expression proﬁle of the Lrrﬁp1
transcripts and the studied isoform not only in cortical
samples of MCAO-exposed animals but also in ratcultured astrocytes submitted to in vitro ischemia by
OGD. First, before qPCR analysis, we conﬁrmed that
the diﬀerent transcripts (rLrrﬁp1, CRA_g and rFlap-1)
were expressed in astrocytes by conventional PCR
(PCRs A, H and I of Table 1, respectively; data not
shown). rLrrﬁp1 gradually increased from 0 to 2 h after
reperfusion, reaching the maximum at 2 h (4.2-fold
change; p < 0.01 for 0 and 0.5 h; p < 0.001 for 2 h;
Fig. 5A). CRA_g increased from 0 to 2 h after
reperfusion achieving similar expression levels at all
time points (2.4–3-fold changes; p < 0.001 0, 0.5 and
2 h; Fig. 5B). The expression pattern of rFlap-1 showed
a biphasic proﬁle, ﬁrst increased from 0 to 0.5 h
(p < 0.05 0 h; p < 0.01 0.5 h), returned to control levels
at 2 h and signiﬁcantly increased and reached a peak of
expression at 6 h (2.3-fold change; p < 0.001; Fig. 5C).
At protein level, rLrrﬁp1 gradually increased from 5 h to
reach statistical signiﬁcance at 24 h of reperfusion
(p < 0.01
for
24 h;
Fig.
5D).
The
double
inmunoﬂuorescence staining showed a signiﬁcant
increase in rLrrﬁp1 and GFAP expression in the OGD
group (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively) and that
rLrrﬁp1 was located in the cytoplasm of control and
OGD-exposed astrocytes at 24-h post reperfusion
(Fig. 5E).

rLrrﬁp1 knockdown reduces p-b-catenin (Ser552),
p-Akt (Ser473), p-mTOR (Ser2448) and GLT-1
expression and glutamate uptake in astrocytes
It has recently been described that the Lrrﬁp1 isoform 1 of
mouse promotes phosphorylation of b-catenin at Ser552
in macrophages (Yang et al., 2010) and, since the
activation of the Akt kinase results in b-catenin
phosphorylation at Ser552 (Fang et al., 2007), it has
been postulated that the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH-Akt
pathway could be involved in activating b-catenin
downstream of Lrrﬁp1 (Rathinam et al., 2010). As we
have demonstrated that the rat reference Lrrﬁp1 protein
was the ortholog of the mouse isoform 1, we decided to
determine whether it also regulates b-catenin activation
and Akt activity in astrocytes; furthermore, as GLT-1,
also named EAAT2, is the main glutamate transporter in
astrocytes in adult tissue (Robinson, 1998), following
our earlier study (Mallolas et al., 2006) we decided to
determine whether rLrrﬁp1 regulates its expression
physiologically in these cells. To these aims, rat
astrocytes were transfected with Lrrﬁp1-speciﬁc siRNAs
(siLrrﬁp1). rLrrﬁp1 inhibition was detected six days after
transfection (39%; p < 0.01; Fig. 6A). rLrrﬁp1
knockdown correlated with reduced expression of the
phosphorylated forms of b-catenin (Ser552; 33%;
p < 0.01), Akt (Ser473; 32%; p < 0.01) and mTOR
(Ser2448; 29%; p < 0.05) (Fig. 6B–D, respectively). In
addition, on analyzing GLT-1 expression, we conﬁrmed
a reduction at protein and mRNA levels (37%; p < 0.01
and 41%; p < 0.001, respectively) in the siLrrﬁp1transfected astrocytes (Fig. 6E, F), which correlated with
a reduction in glutamate uptake (39%; p < 0.001;
Fig. 6G).

Although Lrrﬁp1 is a poorly studied protein, the
information available about it, including our own
previous ﬁnding that it is a regulator of GLT-1
expression, suggests that it could play a role in cerebral
ischemia. As a necessary prior step to a study of its role
in cerebral ischemia, our aim in this study was to
characterize Lrrﬁp1 in the brain. The present study has
identiﬁed that at least ﬁve diﬀerent Lrrﬁp1 transcripts are
expressed in the rat brain and that three of them are
up-regulated, showing diﬀerent expression patterns,
after MCAO in the cerebral cortex and after OGD in
astrocytes. Focusing on rLrrﬁp1, the main isoform and
the ortholog of mouse isoform 1, it was found to be
up-regulated from acute to late phases of ischemia in
cortical neurons and astrocytes. We have conﬁrmed that
rLrrﬁp1 induces phosphorylation of b-catenin at Ser552
in astrocytes as previously reported for mouse
macrophages (Yang et al., 2010) and, in addition, we
have shown for the ﬁrst time that rLrrﬁp1 induces Akt
and mTOR phosphorylation at Ser473 and Ser2448,
respectively, and positively regulates the expression of
the GLT-1.
First, we identiﬁed and characterized the Lrrﬁp1
transcripts in rat brain. We have found that at least ﬁve
of the putative Lrrﬁp1 transcripts are expressed in the

cerebral cortex: rLrrﬁp1 (NM_001014269), CRA_i,
CRA_g, CRA_h0 and rFlap-1 (CRA_a0 ). The high degree
of homology among the newly identiﬁed variants (CRA_)
but not with the reference Lrrﬁp1 protein and the
diﬀerent spatial distribution of each transcript in the
brain might suggest that distinct Lrrﬁp1 isoforms can

play diﬀerent roles. We have determined that some
Lrrﬁp1 isoforms are conserved among diﬀerent species.
Therefore, with regard to the possible functions of these
isoforms according to the available information about
their orthologs, rLrrﬁp1 and rFlap-1 may both positively
regulate the b-catenin-dependent pathway (Lee and

Stallcup, 2006; Yang et al., 2010), which is described as
performing a protective role in both cell adhesion and
neural development (Brembeck et al., 2006; Zhang
et al., 2011). On the other hand, rFlap-1 would regulate
brain TLR-associated signaling (Dai et al., 2009;
Bagashev et al., 2010), which may have either
detrimental (Caso et al., 2007; Hua et al., 2009) or
beneﬁcial (Hanke and Kielian, 2011; Okun et al., 2011)
eﬀects on the CNS. To the best of our knowledge,
neither mouse isoform 3 nor human isoforms 1 and 2
have yet been studied, so the possible roles of CRA_g
and CRA_h0 in the brain are unknown. However, as all
the rat isoforms identiﬁed may bind to Fli-I and Dvl
proteins, it is possible that all of them, whether
individually or in co-operation, act as a link between
molecules involved in signal transduction and the actin
cytoskeleton, regulating the function of the cytoskeleton,
cell migration, proliferation, adhesion, and morphology
(Campbell et al., 2002; Etienne-Manneville and Hall,
2002; Kopecki et al., 2009). Finally, neither of the
isoforms contained the DNA-binding domain and
therefore they probably do not function as transcription
factors as has been described for human isoform 5
(Reed et al., 1998; Khachigian et al., 1999; Eden et al.,
2001; Suriano et al., 2005; Mallolas et al., 2006). This

agrees with the ﬁnding that none of the isoforms
identiﬁed in the rat brain resemble human isoforms 3 to 5.
With regard to the gene expression analysis of
rLrrﬁp1, CRA_g and rFlap-1 transcripts, the mean CT
values obtained allow us to conclude that rLrrﬁp1 is the
predominant transcript in the cerebral cortex, which
agrees with the distribution of the transcripts in the Allen
Mouse Brain Atlas that shows a low expression level of
these transcripts at basal level and a diﬀerential spatial
distribution. Speciﬁcally, the analysis of rLrrﬁp1 showed
a long-term high expression at both mRNA and protein
level from the acute to the late phase of ischemia as
well as an up-regulation both in cortical neurons and
astrocytes of the peri-infarct area. Therefore, these
results conﬁrm the previously described signiﬁcant
increase in the rLrrﬁp1 protein at 2- and 24-h postMCAO (Mallolas et al., 2006), agree with recent results
showing an increased expression of Lrrﬁp1 after serum
starvation (Arakawa et al., 2010), and suggest that
rLrrﬁp1 is expressed in all cellular types of the brain, as
it is considered a ubiquitous protein (Fong and de
Couet, 1999; Rikiyama et al., 2003). The present results
are also in concordance with Khachigian et al., who
found that GCF2 was basally expressed in normal rat
artery wall and that injury dramatically increased GCF2

62

expression in the media layer (Khachigian et al., 1999).
Finally, Lrrﬁp1 protein is found to be increased at 30 min
after MCAO whereas the mRNA remains still
unchanged; this discordance could be explained by the
contribution of post-transcriptional and post-translational
regulation in addition to the fact that mRNAs are
produced at a much lower rate than proteins in
mammals, which could be more evident at the shorter
times analyzed as is the case here (Vogel and
Marcotte, 2012).
The brain role of Lrrﬁp1 remains unknown. Since our
previous data pointed to astrocytes as a major target of
Lrrﬁp1 actions (Mallolas et al., 2006), we focused our
functional study on this cellular type. As in the cortical
samples, the expression of rLrrﬁp1, rFlap-1 and CRA_g
transcripts increases in astrocytes after OGD with
diﬀerent expression patterns. Speciﬁcally, rLrrﬁp1 is upregulated and localized in the cytoplasm of astrocytes
both in control and OGD conditions. Although this
isoform conserves the NLS, it seems that it exerts its
function in the cytoplasm, as we conﬁrmed via siRNA
transfection experiments. The present study shows that
rLrrﬁp1 induces b-catenin activation in astrocytes, as
reported for the mouse isoform 1 in mouse
macrophages (Yang et al., 2010). In addition, rLrrﬁp1 is
also involved in Akt and mTOR phosphorylation and in
the regulation of GLT-1 expression, both at
transcriptional and translational levels. These results
conﬁrm that the rLrrﬁp1 isoform detected in rat cortex
and astrocytes is the ortholog of mouse isoform 1 and
show for the ﬁrst time that Akt is a downstream target of
rLrrﬁp1, regulated directly or indirectly by it, as
previously suggested (Rathinam et al., 2010). In turn,
b-catenin and mTOR are downstream targets of Akt
(Hahn-Windgassen et al., 2005; Fang et al., 2007), but
we cannot discard that rLrrﬁp1 also regulates its
expression independently of Akt. These results strongly
support the idea that rLrrﬁp1 regulates key intracellular
pathways involved in cell growth, proliferation,
metabolism, and survival (Schmelzle and Hall, 2000;
Brembeck et al., 2006; Marone et al., 2008), in
agreement with the role attributed to LRRFIP1 in
promoting cell invasion and metastasis in cancer
(Arakawa et al., 2010; Ohtsuka et al., 2011; Ariake
et al., 2012). In addition, the neuroprotective function
attributed to the activated forms of b-catenin (Lei et al.,
2008), Akt (Zhao et al., 2006; Shi et al., 2011; Chong
et al., 2012) and mTOR (Chong et al., 2010, 2012)
suggests a protective role of rLrrﬁp1 in cerebral
ischemia through the activation of these pathways and
the indirect regulation of proteins involved in the
inﬂammatory and apoptotic response, such as caspase12, NF-kappa B, Grp78 (Florian et al., 2008; Jiang
et al., 2010; Yuan et al., 2011) or ANXA1 (Tyburczy
et al., 2010; Joseph et al., 2012). With regard to GLT-1
expression, we have conﬁrmed in this study that,
physiologically,
rLrrﬁp1
regulates
positively
its
expression in astrocytes. Given that rLrrﬁp1 has a
cytoplasmic location, it probably regulates GLT-1
expression and the levels of extracellular glutamate
through the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling,

as previously described (Wu et al., 2010). Excessive
levels of extracellular glutamate in the nervous system
are excitotoxic and lead to neuronal death (Rothman
and Olney, 1986; Choi and Rothman, 1990) and
glutamate transport, mainly by GLT-1, is the only
mechanism for maintaining glutamate concentrations
below excitotoxic levels (Takahashi et al., 1997; Seal
and Amara, 1999; Danbolt, 2001; Gegelashvili et al.,
2001; Maragakis and Rothstein, 2001). Therefore,
rLrrﬁp1 appears as a regulator of this key transporter to
avoid neurotoxicity in numerous neurological processes
(Lipton and Rosenberg, 1994; Li et al., 1997; Lin et al.,
1998). Our results conﬁrm that each Lrrﬁp1 isoform can
have diﬀerent or even opposing functions. We
previously described a transcriptional repression
function of human GCF2 isoform over a polymorphic
promoter of GLT-1 (Mallolas et al., 2006). In the present
study, the Lrrﬁp1 rat isoform studied positively
regulates, probably through the activation of PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling, the expression and functionality of
GLT-1 in astrocytes. Finally, this study supports the
importance, previously described (Buga et al., 2008,
2012), of individually identifying and analyzing each
transcript of a gene in order to avoid misinterpretations
that may result from a global analysis performed before
target validation.
In summary, this is the ﬁrst report to identify the
diﬀerent transcriptional variants of Lrrﬁp1 in the brain
and to characterize their diﬀerential expression patterns
and the subcellular location of the main isoform rLrrﬁp1
in ischemic conditions. Moreover, we have identiﬁed
Akt, mTOR and b-catenin as the downstream targets of
rLrrﬁp1 through which it is able to regulate important
pathways and proteins involved in cerebral ischemia,
such as the GLT-1. Taken together, these ﬁndings
suggest a physiological protective role for Lrrﬁp1 in the
brain, and the up-regulation detected after focal
ischemia suggests that Lrrﬁp1 may be a neuroprotective
protein in cerebral ischemia. In addition, since diﬀerent
Lrrﬁp1 isoforms may have complementary or opposing
roles in the brain, our work opens up new lines of
investigation in the identiﬁcation of their roles in stroke
and other settings and helps to further characterize the
Lrrﬁp1 gene.
