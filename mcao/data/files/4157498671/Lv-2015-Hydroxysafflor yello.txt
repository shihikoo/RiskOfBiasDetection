The innate immune response, which is tightly regulated by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway, has been
shown to play a critical role in brain damage following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hydroxysafﬂor yellow A (HSYA) is the active component extracted from the Flos Carthami and has been reported to decrease neurological deﬁcit scores following ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, the precise mechanism by which it exerts these neuroprotective effects remains poorly understood. In this
study, we demonstrated that the administration of HSYA could signiﬁcantly down-regulate TLR4 expression in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice. Following the down-regulation of TLR4 by
HSYA treatment, cerebral infarction and inﬂammatory neuronal damage was alleviated. The number of
apoptotic neurons in the HSYA-treated group was signiﬁcantly decreased along with the decrease in TLR4
expression in MCAO mice. Activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways was observed at 1 h
following ischemia and at 24 h post-reperfusion. HSYA could signiﬁcantly inhibit NF-κB p-p65, ERE1/2,
JNK and p38 phosphorylation, which coincided with the suppressed secretion of inﬂammatory cytokines
such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and nitric oxide (NO). Moreover, brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was up-regulated following 1 h of ischemia and continued to increase initially during reperfusion but was down-regulated at later stages. Following treatment with
HSYA, BDNF was up-regulated relative to control MCAO mice at 1 h post-ischemia and at 12 and 24 h
post-reperfusion. Our data suggest that HSYA exerts neurotrophic and anti-inﬂammatory functions
against ischemic stroke by inhibiting TLR4 pathway-mediated signaling responses.

1. Introduction
Cerebral ischemia stroke leads to poor oxygen supply or cerebral hypoxia and subsequently to damage to the central nervous
system (CNS). Reperfusion in the ischemic brain leads to a cascade
of pathophysiological processes that result in further damage that
is referred to as ischemia reperfusion injury (Hua et al., 2015). The
mechanisms that are involved in cerebral ischemic damage are
related to inﬂammation, excitotoxicity and free radical-induced
neuronal damage (Orsu et al., 2013). There is increasing evidence
that innate immune cells are also important contributors to ischemic complications (Courties et al., 2014). The innate immune
system senses the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms and
tissue injury via Toll-like receptors (Quiniou et al., 2013), of which
Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is the best studied. TLR4, the innate

immune receptor for bacterial endotoxins, plays a pivotal role in
the induction of inﬂammatory responses (Johnson et al., 2002).
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling has been
shown to play a critical role in producing neuroprotective effects
following cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (Ramos-Cejudo
et al., 2015). As one of the most important nuclear transcription
factors, nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κB) is involved in immune
and inﬂammatory responses (Gao et al., 2009). Critical members
that are regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
include protein kinase (ERK) 1/2, p38 MAPK (p38), and c-Jun NH2terminal protein kinase (JNK) are activated by TLR4-mediated
immune signaling pathways (Hu et al., 2013). These immune signals then induce the expression of various pro-inﬂammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β
(IL-1β) and nitric oxide (NO) (Barton and Medzhitov, 2003).
Therefore, the suppression of TLR4-mediated pathways has become a promising target for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Hydroxysafﬂor yellow A (HSYA) is the major active component
extracted from the Chinese herb Flos Carthami (Honghua).

Hydroxysafﬂor yellow A has proven to be water-soluble and able
to penetrate the blood brain barrier during cerebral ischemia
conditions (He, 2009). Previous studies have indicated that HSYA
possesses various types of bioactivities including oxygen free radical-scavenging, anti-inﬂammatory actions and anti-apoptotic
mechanisms (Tian et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2012; Ji et al., 2009). In
addition, studies have also shown that HSYA could signiﬁcantly
decrease neurological deﬁcit scores, reduce the percentage of infarction and improve blood rheological parameters following
ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats, the mechanisms by which
involved the attenuation of MDA content, SOD activity and protein
levels of IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha (Wei et al., 2005; Ye and Gao,
2008; Zhu et al., 2005). We have previously demonstrated the
protective effects of hydroxysafﬂor yellow A target proteins
against cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury that act through the
innate immunity signaling pathway (Lv et al., 2015). However, the
underlying therapeutic mechanisms for hydroxysafﬂor yellow A
on ischemic stroke remain poorly understood. Hence, the present
study primarily explored the effects of hydroxysafﬂor yellow A on
a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice to provide additional evidence for the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials and reagents
TLR4, NF-κB p-p65 (p-p65), NF-κB p65 (p65), p-ERK1/2, ERK1/
2, p-JNK, JNK, p-p38, p38, β-actin and GAPDH primary antibodies
and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology Sigma (CST,
St. Louis, USA). BDNF antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Abcam, Cambridge, USA). Mouse TNF-α, IL-1β and NO ELISA kits were
purchased from Beyotime Biological Technology Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu,
China). All other chemicals used, unless otherwise stated, were
obtained from Sigma Chemicals (Sigma, St. Louis, USA). Hydroxysafﬂor yellow A (HSYA) was produced by Nanjing Zelang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China), and its purity as analyzed by
high performance liquid chromatography peak area normalization
was 98.8%.
2.2. Animals and treatment
C57BL/6J mice weighing 18–22 g were purchased from the
Model Animal Research Center of Yangzhou University (Yangzhou
certiﬁcate no. SCXK 2012-0004) and were housed in the central
laboratory of The First Afﬁliated Hospital of Nanchang University
with a 12 h light–dark cycle, optimal temperature and humidity,
ﬁltered water, and appropriate nutrient feed. All procedures related to the care of animals were performed according to the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All experimental protocols were approved by
Institutional Animal Care and use Committee of Nanchang University. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and
reduce the number of animals used.
2.3. Animal grouping
The HSYA group was injected with 2 mg/kg HSYA into the tail
vein at the onset of 1 h of cerebral ischemia and then received
additional injections of 2 mg/kg every 24 h during the 4-day experimental period. The control group received injections of the
equivalent volume of 0.9% NaCl solution. In protocol 1, mice were
randomly divided into sixteen groups (n ¼6 for each group):
(1) sham operated mice; (2) MCAO mice exposed to 1 h of ischemia and treated with vehicle; (3) mice exposed to 1 h of ischemia

325

and 1 h of reperfusion and treated with vehicle; (4) 1 h of ischemia, 1 h of reperfusion and treatment with 2 mg/kg HSYA; (5) 1 h
of ischemia, 3 h of reperfusion and treatment with vehicle; (6) 1 h
of ischemia, 3 h of reperfusion and treatment with 2 mg/kg HSYA;
(7) 1 h of ischemia, 6 h of reperfusion and treatment with vehicle;
(8) 1 h of ischemia, 6 h of reperfusion and treatment with 2 mg/kg
HSYA; (9) 1 h of ischemia, 12 h of reperfusion and treatment with
vehicle; (10) 1 h of ischemia, 12 h of reperfusion and treatment
with 2 mg/kg HSYA; (11) 1 h of ischemia, 24 h of reperfusion and
treatment with vehicle; (12) 1 h of ischemia, 24 h of reperfusion
and treatment with 2 mg/kg HSYA; (13) 1 h of ischemia, 36 h of
reperfusion and treatment with vehicle, (14) 1 h of ischemia, 36 h
of reperfusion and treatment with 2 mg/kg HSYA; (15) 1 h of
ischemia, 72 h of reperfusion and treatment with vehicle; and (16)
1 h of ischemia, 72 h of reperfusion and treatment with 2 mg/kg
HSYA. At the different reperfusion times, the mice were then killed
and processed for TLR4 and BDNF western blot analysis. In protocol 2, mice were randomly divided into three groups (n ¼6 for
each group): (1) sham operated mice; (2) 1 h of ischemia, 24 h of
reperfusion and treatment with vehicle; and (3) 1 h of ischemia,
24 h of reperfusion and treatment with 2 mg/kg HSYA. At the
conclusion of the ischemia and reperfusion period, the mice were
killed for the analysis of ERK1/2, p38 and JNK expression and
phosphorylation. In addition, cerebral infarct volumes and TUNEL
staining were measured, and the nuclear translocation and protein
expression of NF-κB p65 and BDNF were examined by immunocytochemistry. Finally, tissue specimens were cut into sections and stained with H&E. The histological morphology of each
brain specimen was examined under optical microscopy.
2.4. Focal cerebral ischemia
C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate intraperitoneally (400 mg/kg i.p.) (Ozden and Isenmann, 2004;
Maud et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2011). Body temperature was held at
37 °C by means of a thermostatically controlled heating blanket
until the animals recovered from surgery. Focal cerebral ischemia
was induced by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) as described previously (Guan et al., 2013). Neck vessels
were exposed with a midline incision, and the branches of the
right external carotid artery were isolated and cauterized. A blunttip 6-0 nylon monoﬁlament was inserted into the proximal external carotid artery stump and advanced 8–10 mm into the internal carotid artery to occlude the middle cerebral artery. Rectal
temperatures were carefully monitored, and tempered with a
heating pad maintained at 37.570.5 °C during surgery. Mice in the
sham condition underwent the same surgical procedure, but the
suture was not advanced into the internal carotid artery. A laser
Doppler ﬂowmeter (LDF, FLPI2, Moor, England) was used to conﬁrm the decrease in middle cerebral artery blood ﬂow to below
30% of the basic cerebral blood ﬂow immediately following the
occlusion. Those animals with a decreased blood ﬂow to below
30% of pre-ischemia levels were used for further study.
2.5. Measurement of the infarct volumes
Following 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion injury, mice
were killed under deep anesthesia using 10% chloral hydrate and
perfused transcardially with 0.9% NaCl. The brains of all mice were
quickly removed for dissection into six coronal blocks at a thickness of 2 mm/section. The fresh slices were incubated in 2% 2,3,5triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride solution in phosphate-buffered
saline at 37 °C for 20 min. The normal area of the brain was stained
with TTC based on intact mitochondrial function, whereas the
infarct area remained unstained. Stained slices were photographed
by a Cannon sx20 high-resolution digital camera (Japan). Using a

326

computerized Motic Med 6.0 image analysis system (Motic, China),
the total volume of infarction was determined by integrating the
areas from all sections.
2.6. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
Mice were anesthetized following 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of
reperfusion and perfused transcardially with 0.9% NaCl and 4%
paraformaldehyde through the left ventricle. After the brain was
removed, it was post-ﬁxed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for
24 h. Following dehydration, the specimens were embedded in
parafﬁn, cut into 5-mm sections and stained with H&E. The histological morphology of each brain specimen was examined under
optical microscopy.
2.7. TUNEL staining
TUNEL staining was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Brains
were removed following 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion,
and brain tissue sections were incubated in freshly prepared permeabilization solution (0.1% (w/v) triton x-100, 0.1% (w/v) sodium
citrate) for 2 min on ice. The TUNEL reaction mixture was then
added to the brain sections and incubated in a humidiﬁed atmosphere at 37 °C for 60 min in the dark. Images from TUNEL-stained
sections were acquired with MetaMorph imaging software (Molecular Device) using a Nikon epi-ﬂuorescence microscopy equipped with a CoolSNAP-EZ CCD (charge-coupled-device)-camera
(Photometrics). The number of apoptotic neuronal cells in the
penumbra from each brain section was counted using MetaMorph
imaging software.
2.8. Immunocytochemistry
The expression of NF-κB p65 and BDNF was examined by immunocytochemistry following 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. Parafﬁn sections of brain tissue were treated by microwave heat-induced epitope retrieval. After the specimens were
washed three times in PBS (pH 7.4), they were incubated for 1 h at
37 °C with anti-rabbit NF-κB p65 antibody (green) (1:500, Millipore) and anti-rabbit BDNF antibody (1:500, Millipore). The wash
step was repeated, and the nuclei of all cells were counterstained
with DAPI (1:100, Invitrogen) for 10 min at room temperature.
After three washes with PBS, the tissues were mounted in Prolong
Gold Antifade reagent. Images were collected by a confocal ﬂuorescence microscope (Leiss LSM710) with a magniﬁcation of  200.
2.9. Western blot analysis
According to protocol 1, sham animals and those exposed to 1 h
of ischemia and 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 72 h of reperfusion and
treated with vehicle or HSYA were killed, the total protein was
extracted from the infarct cortex, and protein concentrations were
determined by BCA assay. Samples containing 40 mg protein were
separated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels.
Subsequently, the proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes in a Tris-glycine transfer buffer. The membranes were
blocked for 2 h with 5% nonfat dry milk at room temperature and
probed with rabbit anti-TLR4 (1:1000, CST) and anti-BDNF (1:400,
Abcam) at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 50 min. According
to protocol 2, sham mice and those exposed to 1 h of ischemia and
24 h of reperfusion and treated with vehicle or HSYA were killed,
and total protein from samples processed for western blot analysis
as described above. The membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5%
nonfat dry milk at room temperature and detected with rabbit

anti-p65, anti-p-p65, anti-ERK1/2, anti-p-ERK1/2, anti-p-JNK, antiJNK, anti-p38, anti-p-p38 antibodies (1:1000, CST) at 4 °C overnight followed by an incubation with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 50 min. The bands were visualized
with enhanced chemiluminescence, and images were captured
using a Bio-Image Analysis System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
2.10. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Sham mice and those exposed to 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of
reperfusion and treated with vehicle or HSYA according to protocol
2 were killed, and brain tissue homogenates were obtained from
the cortices from the ischemic hemisphere. The concentrations of
TNF-α, IL-1β and NO were measured using speciﬁc ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’ instructions. Absorbance at 450 nm
wavelength was measured, and the protein concentration was
determined by interpolation onto absorbance curves generated by
recombinant TNF-α, IL-1β or NO protein standards using an ELISA
reader (Model ELX800, BioTek, USA).
2.11. Statistical analysis
All values are expressed as the mean 7S.D. Differences between the groups were compared using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test. An unpaired Student's t-test was
used to compare data between two groups. The level of signiﬁcance was set to Po 0.05, P o0.01.

3. Results
3.1. HSYA displays neuroprotective activity in MCAO mice by inhibiting TLR4 expression.
In sham-operated mice, which expressed TLR4 normally
(Fig. 1B), ischemia and reperfusion produced an up-regulation in
TLR4–expression in those mice; TLR4 was up-regulated at 1 h of
ischemia (1.25 70.24, P o0.01) compared to the sham-operated
mice (0.63 70.16). The up-regulation of TLR4 continued following
1 h of reperfusion (1.577 0.19, P o0.05) as compared to mice exposed only to 1 h of ischemia. TLR4 gradually increased after 3 h
(1.68 70.27, Po0.05), 6 h (1.75 70.79, Po 0.05) and 12 h
(2.15 70.23, P o0.05) of reperfusion compared to mice exposed
only to 1 h of ischemia. The time course of TLR4 expression following ischemia reperfusion injury increased gradually over time,
with 24 h of reperfusion producing the highest level of expression
(2.62 70.15, Po 0.01, Fig. 1B). TLR4 was decreased at 36 h
(2.16 70.27, P o0.01) and 72 h (1.65 7 0.17, P o0.01) of reperfusion; however, the expression level remained higher than in shamoperated mice. Western blot analysis of TLR4 showed a signiﬁcant
increase in ischemia reperfusion mice compared to mice in the
sham-operated group, and this increase was signiﬁcantly reduced
by treatment with HSYA (Fig. 1B). HSYA down-regulated TLR4
expression at 1 h (1.47 70.17, Po0.05), 3 h (1.69 70.13, P o0.05),
6 h (1.7070.21, P o0.05), 12 h (1.89 70.26, P o0.01), 24 h
(1.97 70.21, P o0.01), 36 h (1.63 7 0.28, P o0.01) and 72 h
(1.54 70.26, P o0.01) of reperfusion compared to mice at the
corresponding reperfusion times that were treated with vehicle.
The HSYA intervention produced the greatest down-regulation of
TLR4 expression at 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. To
further verify the effects of HSYA, we evaluated the density of
apoptotic neurons. Sham-operated brain tissue sections showed a
normal cellular morphology and tightly packed nerve cellular
structures, whereas ischemic brain tissue sections showed decreased cell density with hyperchromatic and solid nuclei. As
shown in Fig. 1A, the density of apoptotic neurons decreased

gradually over time following HSYA treatment as compared to the
ischemia reperfusion group receiving vehicle. The numbers of
apoptotic neurons reached their peak (65.79 73.16, P o0.01) at
1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion compared to mice exposed
only to 1 h of ischemia (20.46 7 3.01). In contrast, the number
of apoptotic neurons were decreased following HSYA intervention

at 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion (50.79 77.57, P o0.01).
HSYA has been shown to mediate TLR4 expression and the
density of apoptotic neurons at 24 h of reperfusion. We predict
that HSYA signiﬁcantly reduced the density of TUNEL-stained
apoptotic cells by inducing the down-regulation of TLR4
expression.

3.2. HSYA reduces infarct volume and alleviates cerebral injury in
cerebral ischemia reperfusion-injured mice
The infarct volume and the degree of neuronal cells were
evaluated following 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. TTCstained sections clearly showed that the unstained tissues represented the infarct volume (Fig. 2A). Mice from the 1 h of
ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion group displayed an obvious
manifestation of cerebral infarction (39.30 73.30, P o0.01,
Fig. 2A), whereas mice in the sham group (8.85 7 1.03, Fig. 2A) did
not show any signs of cerebral injury, indicating the success of the
MCAO model (Fig. 2A). However, ischemic mice that had received
2 mg/kg HSYA showed a much smaller infarct volume
(19.05 71.46, P o0.01, Fig. 2B). Neuronal cells in the infarct volume of ischemic mice appeared shrunken and showed condensed
nuclei, and this phenotype was ameliorated by HSYA treatment
(Fig. 3A).
3.3. HSYA up-regulates the BDNF pathway in cerebral ischemia reperfusion-injured mice.
We used western blot analyses to examine secretion of BDNF
following cerebral ischemia reperfusion. The expression of BDNF
was up-regulated following 1 h of ischemia (2.75 70.54, P o0.01)
as compared to the sham group (1.43 70.36). The level of BDNF
protein was persistently high following 1 h (2.92 7 0.25, P o0.05)
and 3 h (2.39 70.26, P o0.05) of reperfusion and then began to be
down-regulated at 6 h (1.89 7 0.15, P o0.05) of reperfusion as
compared to mice exposed only to 1 h of ischemia (Fig. 4). BDNF
expression remained low expression after 6 h of reperfusion, and
our western blot analysis showed that BDNF was degraded signiﬁcantly following 12 h (1.78 70.15, P o0.05) and especially 24 h
(0.96 70.17, P o0.05), 36 h (0.81 7 0.15) and 72 h (0.79 70.26) of
reperfusion as compared to mice exposed only to 1 h of ischemia
(Fig. 4). HSYA might exert its beneﬁcial effects by modulating the
expression of BDNF in the later reperfusion period, and HSYA
treatment led to a signiﬁcant up-regulation of BDNF at 12 h
(1.62 70.26, P o0.05) and 24 h of reperfusion (1.54 70.47,

329

Po 0.01) compared with mice at corresponding reperfusion times.
To further examine the secretion of BDNF following HSYA treatment, we performed immunohistochemical analysis at 1 h of
ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion, the results of which were consistent with our western blot results: BDNF levels were decreased
signiﬁcantly following 24 h of reperfusion and were increased
following treatment with HSYA.
3.4. HSYA suppresses the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways in cerebral ischemia reperfusion-injured mice
TLR4 is able activate a common signaling pathway by inducing
NF-κB p65, ERK1/2, JNK and p38 phosphorylation, while HSYA
inhibited the phosphorylation of these proteins. The phosphorylation levels of NF-κB p65 (2.15 70.04, Po 0.01, Fig. 5B), ERK1
(2.337 0.12, P o0.01, Fig. 6A), ERK2 (2.50 70.24, Po 0.01, Fig. 6A),
JNK (2.14 70.20, P o0.01, Fig. 6B) and p38 (1.707 0.11, Po 0.01,
Fig. 6C) were signiﬁcantly increased in the MCAO group compared
to those in the sham group NF-κB p65 (1.33 70.19), ERK1
(0.34 70.06), ERK2 (0.6770.12), JNK (0.6770.08) and p38
(1.10 70.09) at 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. However,
this increase was signiﬁcantly neutralized by HSYA, indicating that
the neuroprotective effects of HSYA could be mediated by the
suppression of the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 (1.73 70.18,
Po 0.01, Fig. 5B), ERK1 (1.37 70.14, P o0.05, Fig. 6A), ERK2
(1.72 70.13, P o0.05, Fig. 6A), JNK (1.337 0.12, P o0.01, Fig. 6B)
and p38 (1.40 70.09, P o0.01, Fig. 6C). To identify the downstream
effectors in the TLR4 pathway, we examined the secretion level of
cytokines by ELISA. The serum levels of TNF-α (124.4674.28,
Po 0.01, Fig. 6D), IL-1β (178.12 76.15, P o0.01, Fig. 6D) and NO
(89.45 72.14, P o0.01, Fig. 6D) were signiﬁcantly increased in the
1 h of ischemia, 24 h group compared to the sham group
(45.36 75.12, 42.10 74.69 and 38.467 3.65, respectively). However, HSYA profoundly inhibited the secretion of TNF-α
(74.10 75.89, P o0.05), IL-1β (72.587 7.54, P o0.01) and NO
(56.78 76.13, P o0.01) following cerebral ischemia reperfusion
injury.

4. Discussion
Hydroxysafﬂor yellow A is the active component derived from
a traditional Chinese herb that has been widely used in treating
cardiovascular and cerebral diseases. He (2009) has systematically
demonstrated that hydroxysafﬂor yellow A increased the permeability of the blood brain barrier during cerebral ischemia conditions. Compared to the sham group, the concentration of HSYA in
the blood brain barrier was increased at 3 h and 24 h reperfusion
following 1 h ischemia. HSYA has usually been administered as a
tail vein injection for the treatment of transient focal ischemia
(Chen et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). Preliminary experiments
have shown 2 mg/kg HSYA to be the proper effective concentration
for decreasing infarct volume and down-regulating TLR4 expression. Therefore, we used a tail vein injection of 2 mg/kg HSYA in
our treatment of cerebral ischemia reperfusion-injured mice. To
determine the efﬁcacy of HSYA, we evaluated the histological

changes produced by cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. We
visualized the cerebral infarct volume and the degree of neuronal
cell changes by TTC, H&E and TUNEL staining following 1 h of
ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion. TUNEL staining is a common
method for detecting the DNA fragmentation that results from the
apoptosis signaling cascade, while H&E staining is widely used in
medical diagnoses and reveals cellular changes by color changes.
Mice in the ischemia-reperfusion groups and HSYA treatment
groups displayed an obvious manifestation of cerebral infarction;
ischemic mice that had received 2 mg/kg HSYA showed a much
smaller infarct size and improved neuronal state. These data demonstrated that HSYA could attenuate the histopathological
changes of neurons within the areas of cerebral infarct.
Multiple molecular abnormalities such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inﬂammation are all involved in ischemic stroke
(Moskowitz et al., 2010). Recent studies have shown that one key
factor in ischemic stroke is the TLR4 innate immunity responses

Y. Lv et al. / European Journal of Pharmacology 769 (2015) 324–332

involved in cellular death following cerebral ischemic injury (Tian
et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2012). Increasing evidence has suggested
that the TLR4-inducing pathway contributes to neuroprotection
following cerebral ischemia reperfusion (Puyal et al., 2009; Zheng
et al., 2009). However, the role of TLR4 in ischemic stroke is still a
matter of debate. Some reports have reported that the intervention of TLR4 expression is closely related to neuronal apoptosis (Tu
et al., 2014). Similarly, the down-regulation of TLR4 expression or
the effects in TLR4-deﬁcit mice could reduce the numbers of
apoptotic neurons and improve ischemic conditions (Guo et al.,
2010). The classical cerebral ischemia model, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), has been widely used to simulate cerebral
ischemia diseases. We investigated the close relationship between
the time course of TLR4 expression and neuronal apoptosis using a
mouse MCAO model. The time course of TLR4 increased gradually
over time following 1 h of ischemia and increasing reperfusion
time. Simultaneously, our TUNEL staining results showed that the
numbers of apoptotic neurons resulting from ischemia reperfusion
injury showed a similar trend to TLR4 expression. Therefore, we
predicted that the attenuating effects of HSYA on the number of
apoptotic neurons could act via effects on the TLR4 signaling
pathway. Therefore, developing anti-TLR4 innate immunity interventions for use during the early stages of ischemia has been an
attractive strategy to combat cerebral lesions.
BDNF is detected in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and
transduces the neurotrophy-related signals to neurons (Yamada
and Nabeshima, 2003). BDNF levels were increased following
global cerebral ischemia reperfusion stimulated by short-term
sleep deprivation or MCAO model followed by ischemia reperfusion injury (Cheng et al., 2015; Liu. et al., 2015). However, reports
have suggested that BDNF might not continue to increase
throughout all stages of reperfusion. During the later stages, pathological process of inﬂammation, BDNF levels might decrease at
24 h or 48 h following intraparenchymal injection into the CNS or
cerebral ischemia (Lindvall et al., 1992; Nikodemova and Watters,
2011). This decrease, in turn, weakens the neurotrophy-related
functions of BDNF on neurons, leading to the aggravation of inﬂammation injury. In the present study, BDNF levels following 1 h
of ischemia were highly up-regulated compared to sham-operated
mice, and the levels remained high until 12 h of reperfusion
compared to mice exposed only to 1 h of ischemia, at which time
BDNF levels began to decrease. At 36 h and 72 h of reperfusion,
BDNF expression levels were comparable to those following 1 h of
ischemia only. Therefore, the up-regulated expression of BDNF
could beneﬁt neurons at the early reperfusion stage, but the subsequent decrease in BDNF levels could exacerbate neuronal damage at later stages of reperfusion. There was no signiﬁcant difference in BDNF expression in the HSYA- and vehicle-treated
groups from 1 h of ischemia to 1 h of ischemia and 12 h of reperfusion when compared to 1 h of ischemia only. However, while
the level of BDNF expression obviously decreased at 12, and 24 h
of reperfusion in vehicle-treated mice, HSYA treatment could
dramatically prevent this decrease in expression (p o0.05;
p o0.01, respectively). Our immunocytochemistry results also
demonstrated that HSYA could up-regulate BDNF expression, with
the greatest effect seen at 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion.
Thus, BDNF could be the underlying mechanism for the neuroprotective functions shown by HSYA against cerebral ischemia
reperfusion.
These ﬁndings suggest that immune modulation by HSYA is a
promising approach for the treatment of brain injury. Other than
its neurotrophic functions, TLR4 could activate a common signaling pathway by triggering p65 phosphorylation (Xiang et al.,
2014). NF-κB has been recognized as a stress-regulated transcription factor that plays a key role in the control of inﬂammatory
responses. The NF-κB pathway has been thought to play crucial

331

inﬂammatory roles in a variety of CNS injury including traumatic
brain injury, global ischemia and transient focal ischemia (Williams et al., 2006). Previous studies have indicated that the activation of NF-κB was sustained following 24 h of reperfusion in the
focal cerebral ischemia MCAO model (Jin et al., 2015). The blockade
of the NF-κB pathway has shown therapeutic efﬁcacy. After receiving a stimulatory signal such as LPS, the NF-κB p65 and IκB-α
inhibitory protein are blocked by HSYA through the inhibition of
TLR4-inducing signaling pathways in mice with lung injuries (Wu
et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014). In accordance with these reports, the
levels of NF-κB p65 phosphorylation in this study were observed
to increase following cerebral ischemia reperfusion as shown by
western blot and immunoﬂuorescence. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of HSYA on NF-κB p65 at 1 h of ischemia and 24 h
of reperfusion, and we observed that HSYA could exert a signiﬁcant inhibition on the activation and nuclear translocation of
NF-kB p65 (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the protective effects of
HSYA against inﬂammatory responses in the brain might be
mediated by the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway in cerebral
ischemia reperfusion-injured mice.
The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is known to be an extracellular signal regulated kinase
pathway that plays key functions in cell apoptosis and migration
(Lee et al., 2015). As with the NF-κB signaling pathway, the MAPK
pathway could also participate in the inﬂammatory responses of
the CNS (Williams et al., 2006). The MAPK pathway was also
triggered following ischemia as shown by the increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK and p38 in the brains from normal
mice (Gorina et al., 2011). At 1 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion, the levels of ERK1/2, p38 and JNK phosphorylation were
observed by western blot to be increased. The administration of
HSYA could exert a signiﬁcant inhibition of the phosphorylation of
ERK1/2, p38 and JNK (Fig. 4A–C). Moreover, the TLR4-inducing
pathway initiates neuroinﬂammation cytokines via the NF-κB and
MAPK pathways. The overexpression of cytokines is a classical
inﬂammatory characteristic of brain pathology (Li et al., 2014).
Some anti-inﬂammatory therapies aimed at inhibiting TLR4 activation have displayed neuroprotective effects in MCAO mice
models (Barakat et al., 2014). TNF-α has been recognized as a reactive cytokine and could be considered to be a major pro-inﬂammatory mediator with dual roles in the NF-κB pathway. IL-1β
is elevated following most inﬂammatory responses and participates in inﬂammatory pathology. NO is secreted as a free radical
and plays a role in inﬂammation and immune responses. In the
present study, HSYA was observed to prevent the increase of these
cytokines. Therefore, HSYA is capable of reducing the production
of cytokines in cerebral ischemia-injured mice, and this could have
physiological implications in reducing neuroinﬂammation and
affording neuroprotection to the CNS.
The infarct volume might extend or be reduced due to a variety
of physiological processes. The proliferation of astrocytes or the
open gap junctions between astrocytes, which enable the diffusion
of apoptotic and inﬂammation mediators, could extend the infarct
volume (Baldauf and Reymann, 2005; Campbell et al., 2013).
Conversely, activated microglia or the in vitro transplantation of
microglia could reduce the infarct volume (Yepes et al., 2005). The
infarct volume might also be reduced or extended due to the
migration or activation of astrocytes or microglia. TLR4 is one of
the critical receptors in microglia of the brain for generating innate
immune responses following cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury.
Whether HSYA exerts its neuroprotective effects via activation and
proliferation of astrocytes or microglia is an intriguing mechanism
that warrants further study.
Overall, we demonstrate that HSYA reduces ischemia brain
damage via the inhibition of the TLR4-inducing innate immunity
pathway, which could improve neurological deﬁcits and exert

332

anti-inﬂammatory functions against ischemia stroke. These results
elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of HSYA and suggest a potential therapeutic treatment for cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury.
