Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pinocembrin on brain
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and the potential involvement of autophagy activity
changes in the penumbra area in the mechanisms of pinocembrin activity. Focal cerebral
I/R model was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h followed by
24 h reperfusion. Pinocembrin was administered intravenously at different doses (1, 3, and
10 mg/kg, respectively) at the onset of reperfusion. Neurological function, brain infarction and
brain swelling ratio were evaluated. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemical analysis (Caspase-3) were
used to evaluate apoptosis in the penumbra cortex. Two key proteins of autophagy, LC3B
and Beclin1, were detected by western blot. The results showed that pinocembrin-treatment
could significantly reduce neurological deficit scores, infarct volume, cerebral edema and
improve pathological lesion in the I/R rats. Pinocembrin-treatment could also reduce the
number of TUNEL-positive and Caspase-3-positive neurons, and upregulate the expression
of LC3B and Beclin1 in the penumbra area. These results suggested that pinocembrin
could protect the brain against I/R injury, and the possible mechanisms might be attributed
to inhibition of apoptosis and reversed autophagy activity in the penumbra area.

1. Introduction
Pinocembrin (5,7-dihydroxyflavanone), the most abundant flavonoid in propolis [1], has drawn
much attention for its broad spectrum of pharmacological properties. Our previous studies have
demonstrated that pinocembrin could protect the brain from ischemic injury [2,3], and protection of
neurovascular unit and mitochondria [4,5], anti-inflammation [5] and anti-oxidative stress [3] were
proposed to be the possible mechanisms, but the real mechanisms underlying its protective effects and
the exact targets are still being studied.
Ischemic cerebrovascular abnormality is a kind of severe health-threatening disorder, with high
morbidity, mortality and possibility of causing permanent disability. Thrombolysis therapy plays a
critical role in dealing with ischemic cerebrovascular abnormality. However, the blood reperfusion
process after thrombolysis may cause a more serious tissue injury, namely I/R injury [6,7]. It has been
proposed that energy metabolism deficiency, oxidative stress [8], intracellular and mitochondrial
calcium-overload [9], glutamate/neurotoxin release [10], inflammation [11], and apoptosis [12] may
take part in the process of I/R injury. Accumulating evidence indicates that autophagy also plays an
important role in the mechanisms underlying I/R-induced neuronal damage [13–15].
Autophagy is a catabolic and conserved lysosomal degradation pathway that controls the quality of
cytoplasm by eliminating the intracellular misfolded or aggregated proteins and damaged organelles.
Mounting evidence has implicated the important roles of autophagy in several human diseases [16–21].
In the context of cerebral ischemia, some evidences indicated that autophagy might cause autophagic
cell death [22], while some data suggested that autophagy might be neuroprotective [23,24], raising
controversy with regard to the role of autophagy in ischemic brain injury. Given that autophagy might
play an important role in I/R injury, the aim of this study was to investigate the potential involvement
of autophagy activity change in the mechanisms of pinocembrin against I/R injury.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Effects of Pinocembrin on Neurological Deficits Induced by I/R
As shown in Figure 1A, MCAO for 2 h, followed by 24 h of reperfusion induced obvious
neurological deficit (P < 0.001). Pinocembrin decreased the neurological deficit scores in a
dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001). The effect of pinocembrin, especially at the dose of 10 mg/kg, on
neurological deficit scores was even better than that of edaravone (3.5 mg/kg).
In addition, I/R could also significantly shorten the retention time of rats on the inclined plate
(P < 0.001). Pinocembrin administration prolonged the retention time on the inclined plate in a
dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001) and the effect was superior to edaravone, as illustrated in
Figure 1B.

2.2. Effects of Pinocembrin on Infarct Volume
As illustrated in Figure 2, I/R induced severe infarct in the ischemic hemisphere (51.28%,
P < 0.001). Pinocembrin significantly decreased the infarct volume in a dose-dependent manner. The
effect of pinocembrin on infarct volume, especially at the dose of 10 mg/kg, was even better than that
of edaravone (3.5 mg/kg).

2.3. Effects of Pinocembrin on Cerebral Edema Induced by I/R
As shown in Figure 3, I/R induced severe cerebral edema (22.91%, P < 0.001). Pinocembrin could
significantly ameliorate the cerebral edema in a dose-dependent manner. And at the dose of 10 mg/kg,
pinocembrin showed a better effect than edaravone did.

2.4. Effects of Pinocembrin on Pathological Damages Induced by I/R
2.4.1. Effects of Pinocembrin on Pathological Damages in the Penumbra Area (Nissl’s Staining)
As illustrated in Figure 4B, I/R caused pathomorphological changes in the penumbra region. It
could be seen that the neurons arranged loosely; the nucleus boundary of some neurons was not clear;
nucleoli of some neurons disappeared; vacuole-like changes emerged; some Nissl bodies decreased;
and cell gaps widened. Inflammatory cell infiltration could also be observed. Pinocembrin could
effectively ameliorate the above-mentioned pathological damages, especially at the dose of 10 mg/kg.
2.4.2. Effects of Pinocembrin on Pathological Damages in Hippocampus CA1 Region (Nisslʼs Staining)
As illustrated in Figure 5B. I/R caused serious pathological damages in the hippocampus CA1
region. It could be seen that the neurons arranged loosely; the number of neuron decreased obviously;
the gaps around cells widened; the vacuole-like changes emerged; and some Nissl bodies decreased.
Pinocembrin could effectively ameliorate the above-mentioned pathological damages, especially at the
dose of 10 mg/kg.

2.5. Effects of Pinocembrin on the Expression of Caspase-3 in the Penumbra Area
Caspase-3 plays an important role in regulating apoptosis. As illustrated in Figure 6, I/R
significantly increased the expression of Caspase-3 in the penumbra. Pinocembrin inhibited the
upregulation of Caspase-3 induced by I/R in a dose-dependent manner.

As shown in Figure 7, virtually no TUNEL-positive cells were observed in sham group, while
abundant TUNEL-positive cells were seen in I/R group. At the doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg, pinocembrin
could significantly decrease the number of TUNEL-positive cells.

2.7. Effects of Pinocembrin on the Expression of Autophagy-Related Proteins in the Penumbra Area
The expression of autophagy-related proteins was investigated by western blot. As shown in Figure 8,
in I/R group, the levels of LC3B and Beclin1 in the penumbra decreased significantly. These results
indicated that autophagy was retarded after 2 h of MCAO followed by 24 h reperfusion. Pinocembrin
administration at the onset of reperfusion could significantly increase the levels of LC3B and Beclin1
in the penumbra after 24 h reperfusion. These data suggested that pinocembrin could reverse
autophagy activity in the penumbra after 2 h of MCAO followed by 24 h reperfusion.

2.8. Discussion
In the present study, we confirmed that pinocembrin could protect the brain against I/R injury, by
ameliorating neurological deficits, decreasing the infarct volume and alleviating the cerebral edema,
and exhibited better effects than edaravone did. In addition, we demonstrated that pinocembrin could
improve the pathological lesion in the penumbra. Furthermore, we found that pinocembrin could
inhibit apoptosis and reverse autophagy activity in the penumbra.
Ischemic stroke-caused cerebral damage can be divided by a core of necrotic cell death and
penumbra, which surrounds the damage core [25]. In the penumbra area, the energy metabolism is

Molecules 2014, 19

15793

preserved by constrained blood supply. Both basic investigators of cerebral ischemia and clinicians
pay much attention on penumbra, because it is believed that the penumbra damage is reversible, while
necrotic lesion in the damage core is irreversible. A large number of documents have suggested that
apoptosis was activated in the penumbra [26,27]. In accordance with previous study, our results also
indicated that I/R increased the numbers of Caspase-3 positive cells and TUNEL-positive cells in the
penumbra, which partially demonstrated that apoptosis was activated. In addition, our results proved
that pinocembrin could inhibit the upregulation of Caspase-3 and decrease the number of
TUNEL-positive cells, which indicated that inhibition of apoptosis in the penumbra area may be one of
the mechanisms by which pinocembrin protect the brain against I/R injury.
The results of pathomorphological study also indicated that pinocembrin could protect the
penumbra area. Based on these results, it is suggested that the protective effect on the penumbra may
contribute to the therapeutic effect of pinocembrin on I/R injury.
In recent years, the importance of autophagy in ischemic disease has received much attention. Some
researchers believe that inhibition of autophagy is neuroprotective and may be a novel strategy to
prevent ischemic brain injury [28,29]. However, autophagy activation is also thought to be associated
with neuroprotection in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemic preconditioning [23]. A recent study
revealed that the cerebral I/R-induced autophagy protects against neuronal injury by mitochondrial
clearance [24]. Our results support the view that autophagy plays a protective role in cerebral I/R.
Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) participates in the maturation process of
aotophagosome. Beclin1 plays an important role in inducing autophagy. Our results indicated that the
levels of LC3B and Beclin1 were decreased significantly in the penumbra after 24 h of reperfusion.
These results suggested that autophagy activity in the penumbra was inhibited after 24 h of
reperfusion. It seems that we came to a conclusion which was inaccordance with a previous study [24].
This distinction may be owing to the different criterion we applied in locating the penumbra area,
different injury degree, and different surgery procedure we adopted in establishing I/R model. Our
results also showed that pinocembrin administration at the onset of reperfusion could increase the
levels of LC3B and Beclin1 in the penumbra after 24 h of reperfusion, which indicated that
pinocembrin could reverse the autophagy activity in the penumbra, and we proposed that this effect
may be involved in the mechanisms of pinocembrin against I/R injury. Further research is needed to
elucidate how pinocembrin regulates the autophagy activity in the penumbra and to explore the
potential targets within the autophagy pathway in order to establish new strategies to treat I/R injury.
3. Experimental Section
3.1. Materials
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (260–300 g) were obtained from the SPF Laboratory Animal
Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) and housed at room temperature with a 12 h light/dark cycle
and had access to standard rodent chow and fresh water ad libitum. All experiments were in complete
compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Efforts were made to minimize any pain or discomfort. Edaravone injection was set as positive control
and purchased from Simcere (Nanjing, China). Pinocembrin for injection was provided by Department

Molecules 2014, 19

15794

of Medical Synthetic Chemistry, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (Shanghai,
China). Immunohistochemical assay kit (REALTMEnVision+/HRP RABBIT/MOUSE) was purchased
from Dako Denmark A/S (Glostrup, Denmark).TUNEL staining kit was purchased from Hoffmann-La
Roche Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The antibodies against LC3B, Beclin1 and Caspase-3 were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA). The suture used in MCAO was purchased
from Beijing Cinontech Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China).
3.2. Animal Model of MCAO and Drug Administration
The male SD rats were randomly divided into six groups: sham operation group; I/R group;
I/R + pinocembrin (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) group; I/R + edaravone (3.5 mg/kg) group. Pinocembrin for
injection was dissolved in 0.9% saline water. Focal cerebral I/R model was established by occlusion of
the middle cerebral artery(MCAO) for 2 h followed by 24 h reperfusion according to previously
described methods [30]. Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (i.p. 380 mg/kg).
The right common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA) and internal carotid artery
(ICA) were separated away from adjacent muscles and nerves. A fishing line coated with polylysine
(diameter 0.32 mm) was inserted from a mini-incision on the ECA and got to middle cerebral artery
(MCA). After 2 h of ischemia, the filament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion for 24 h. Pinocembrin
and edaravone were administrated at the onset of reperfusion. After 12 h of reperfusion, pinocembrin
and edaravone were administrated again.
3.2. Neurological Deficit Score Assessment
Neurological deficit score of each rat was assessed 24 h after reperfusion according to Bederson’s
method [31] with minor modification: 0, no neurological symptoms; 1, failure to extend left paw
completely; 2, the strength of left fore-limb decreased obviously; 3, rotating and crawling towards left
side; 4, unable to walk spontaneously.
3.3. Inclined Plane Test
After 24 h of reperfusion, the rats were placed on the coarse surface of a inclined plane, the angle of
which was set as 85°. The duration of each rat stayed on the inclined plane was recorded. For those rats
which could stay on the inclined plane for more than 3 min, the scores were recorded as 180 s.
3.4. Measurement of Cerebral Infarct Volume
TTC staining method was applied for the measurement of cerebral infarct volume [32,33]. After the
neurological deficit score assessment and inclined plane test, the rats were sacrificed, and the brains
were quickly removed, frozen at −20 °C for about 15 min, and then sliced into six 2 mm thick coronal
sections. The slices were stained with 0.5% TTC solution at 37 °C for 15 min. The size of infarct area
(unstained region shown pale) of each section was analyzed (Image-Pro Plus6.0, Media Cybernetics,
Rockville, MD, USA). Infarction rate (%) = A°/A' × 100%, A° represented the infarct volume, A' was
the volume of the homolateral hemisphere.

Molecules 2014, 19

15795

3.5. Measurement of Cerebral Edema
After neurological function evaluation, the rats were decapitated, and the brains were quickly
removed and the cerebellum and the brain stem were excised. And then the brains were dissected along
the sagittal suture. Ischemic hemisphere and contralateral hemisphere were weighed. Cerebral edema
(%) = (B° − B')/B' × 100%, where B° represented the weight of the ischemic hemisphere, B'
represented the homolateral hemisphere weight.
3.6. Histopathological Assessment
After neurological function evaluation, the rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (i.p.
400 mg/kg) and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4). The
brains were removed and further fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, embedded in paraffin wax.
The paraffin-embedded blocks were cut into a series of 5 μm thick slices which contained the
penumbra area and stained with the Nisslʼs staining method. The penumbra area was located according
to the principle described by Ashwal [34].
3.7. Immunohistochemical Assay and Tunel Staining
The expression of Caspase-3 in penumbra area was detected by immunohistochemical method,
using a commercial kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the paraffin-embedded
brain sections were dewaxed and washed in PBS for three times, then immersed in 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 3 min to block intrinsic peroxidase, quenched in BSA for 20 min, and then the sections
were reacted with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Caspase-3 (1:200 dilutions) overnight at 4 °C.
Then, the sections were incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 50 min at 4 °C. After that,
3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) was used for colour development. Finally, haematoxylin was used for
counterstaining. Image-Pro Plus6.0 software was used to analyze the Caspase-3 positive cells ratio.
TUNEL staining for penumbra was performed using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Image-Pro Plus6.0 software was used to analyze the TUNEL positive cells ratio.
3.8. Western Blot Analysis
After the measurement of cerebral edema, the penumbra area was collected according to the
principle described by Ashwal [34]. The total protein of penumbra was extracted. The concentration of
the total protein was detected by Bradford method according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
An aliquot of 40 μg protein from each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and
transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and then blocked with 5% nonfat
milk in 0.5% TBST for 1 hour. The transferred membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with
primary antibodies against LC3B (1:1000 dilution), Beclin1 (1:1000 dilution). After being washed
three times in TBST, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies against rabbit (1:1000
dilution) IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated for 0.5 h at room temperature. An enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) was used to visualize the immunoreactive bands, which were captured on
X-ray film. Optical density of the bands was analyzed by Quantity One software.

one-way ANOVA followed by Dunett’s test using the SPSS software 17.0. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, this study suggested that pinocembrin could protect the brain against
ischemia-reperfusion injury, and inhibition of apoptosis and reversed autophagy activity in the
penumbra area might be involved in the mechanisms.
