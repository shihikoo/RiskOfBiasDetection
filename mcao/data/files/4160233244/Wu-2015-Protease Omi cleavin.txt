Aim: In the penumbra after focal cerebral ischemia, an increase of protease Omi is linked to a decrease of Hs1-associated protein X-1
(Hax-1), a protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family. In this study we investigated the mechanisms underlying the regulation of Hax-1 by
protease Omi in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.
Methods: Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R); cell viability was
assessed with MTT assay. Mice underwent 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and reperfusion, and the infarct volume was
determined with TTC staining. The expression of Omi and Hax-1 was detected using immunoblot and immunofluorescence assays. The
mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using TMRM staining.
Results: In the brains of MCAO mice, the protein level of Omi was significantly increased, while the protein level of Hax-1 was
decreased. Similar changes were observed in OGD/R-treated N2a cells, but the mRNA level of Hax-1 was not changed. Furthermore,
in OGD/R-treated N2a cells, knockdown of Omi significantly increased Hax-1 protein level. Immunofluorescence assay showed that
Omi and Hax-1 were co-localized in mitochondria of N2a cells. OGD/R caused marked mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in N2a
cells, while inhibition of Omi protease activity with UCF-101 (10 μmol/L) or overexpression of Hax-1 could restore the mitochondrial
membrane potential and attenuate cell apoptosis. Moreover, pretreatment of MCAO mice with UCF-101 (7.15 mg/kg, ip) could restore
Hax-1 expression, inhibit caspase activation, and significantly reduce the infarct volume.
Conclusion: Protease Omi impairs mitochondrial function by cleaving Hax-1, which induces apoptosis in OGD/R-treated N2a cells and
causes I/R injury in MCAO mice.

Introduction

Ischemic stroke is one of the most common causes of longterm adult disability and the principal cause of death worldwide. It is known that global ischemia is caused by cardiac
arrest, which leads to a reduced cerebral blood flow throughout the brain, whereas focal ischemia is caused by an embolic
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, resulting in a reduction of blood flow in a specific brain region[1]. Multiple events

are known to be involved in neuronal death after ischemia,
including excitotoxicity[2, 3], oxidative stress[4], inflammation[5, 6],
necrosis and apoptosis[7]. Apoptosis plays a critical role in
ischemic brain injury[7]. As previously reported, apoptotic
changes of neurons in the early stage of focal cerebral ischemia
are presented in the ischemic core, including the condensation
of nuclei and the activation of caspases, before they undergo
necrosis[8]. In the ischemic penumbra, the rim of the ischemic
core, neurons undergo both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis, which contributes to a delayed neuronal
death[9].
Mitochondria are the cellular organelles that play critical
roles in the apoptotic pathway in ischemic injury[10]. As previ-

ously reported, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) generates
free radicals, mainly released by mitochondria, resulting in an
oxidative stress in neurons[11]. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria causes damage of proteins
and lipids, which impairs mitochondrial function and leads to
an increase of mitochondrial membrane permeability[12]. As a
result, the permeabilized mitochondria release cytochrome c,
activating caspases and leading to apoptotic cell death after
I/R[13].
The serine protease Omi/HtrA2 is a mammalian homolog of the bacterial heat-inducible protease HtrA/DegP and
DegS [14]. Under physiological conditions, Omi is mainly
localized in mitochondria and plays an important role in the
maintenance of mitochondrial homeostasis[15]. Mutations that
cause loss of Omi protease activity are usually associated with
neurodegeneration such as Parkinson’s disease[16]. Omi is a
protease that is able to cleave its substrates involved in both
normal function and disease[17]. Upon apoptotic stimuli, Omi
is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol and cleaves
its substrates, such as inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs),
thereby inducing apoptosis[18]. In an ischemic brain, Omi is
involved in neuronal injury after I/R[19]. Once Omi is released
from damaged mitochondria into the cytosol, the cytosolic
substrates of Omi, including anti-apoptotic protein XIAP, are
cleaved, thus causing apoptosis following focal cerebral I/R[20].
Although the functions of Omi in apoptosis are extensively
documented, the functions of Omi in mitochondria under
physiological and pathological conditions are still unclear.
Because Omi is a mitochondrial protein, the identification
of its role in mitochondrial damage after I/R will help to
provide an understanding of its function under pathological
conditions. It was reported that an inhibition of Omi protease activity by UCF-101 shows protective effects on neurons
after I/R[21]. Interestingly, in the penumbra after focal cerebral
ischemia, an increase of Omi corresponds to a decrease of the
mitochondrial protein Hax-1 (Hs1-associated protein X-1),
a protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family[22], suggesting a link
between these two proteins in ischemic injury. However, the
underlying mechanism of how Omi regulates Hax-1 after I/R
is still largely unknown.
In this study, we show that Omi processes specificity for
the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein Hax-1, thus causing
mitochondrial damage and dysfunction and eventually stimulating cerebral ischemic neuronal cell death after I/R.

Materials and methods

Animal experiments
Male ICR mice, 25–30 g, were purchased from SLACCAL Lab
Animal Ltd (Shanghai, China). For the middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) surgery[23], mice were anesthetized with an
intraperitoneal injection of 1% pentobarbital sodium. Then,
the cerebral focal ischemia was produced by intra-luminal
occlusion of the right MCA using a silicone coated nylon (6-0)
monofilament (Doccol Corporation, Redlands, CA, USA). Two
hours later, the occluding filament was withdrawn to allow
blood reperfusion. Cerebral blood flow was monitored (LDF,
Acta Pharmacologica Sinica

ML191 Laser Doppler Blood Flow Meter, Australia) and only
those mice with a 90% of blood flow reduction during MCAO
and a 85%–95% recovery of blood flow during reperfusion
were used for further experiments. A homoeothermic heating blanket was used to maintain the core body temperature
at 37 °C during the I/R operation. Mice in the sham group
underwent identical operations except for the insertion of a
filament. In the UCF-101 (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany)
treatment group, mice were given an intraperitoneal injection
of vehicle or UCF-101 (7.15 mg/kg). Two hours after injection,
the mice were subjected to MACO. All animals were used in
accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal care
and use outlined in a protocol that was approved by the Ethical Committee of Soochow University.
Cell culture and oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)
injury
Mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum with 100 μg/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin. To model OGD/R injury in N2a cells, the cells
were incubated in glucose-free DMEM and saturated with
5% CO2/95% N2 for 4 h. After OGD exposure, the cells were
subjected to reoxygenation with DMEM containing glucose in
normoxia for 24 h.  For the MG132, bafilomycin A1 and UCF101 treatments, cells were treated with MG132 (10 μmol/L),
bafilomycin A1 (1 μmol/L) or UCF-101 (10 μmol/L) for 12 h
while being reoxygenated. Control cells were cultured in
DMEM containing glucose in normoxia. Cells with or without
treatment were subjected to immunofluorescent staining or
immunoblot analyses.
RNA extraction and real-time quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from normoxia or OGD/R treated
N2a cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). cDNA was obtained using a reverse transcription
reagent kit (Takara, Otsu, Shiga, Japan). Quantitative PCR
(qPCR) was performed with Power SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK) and the
products were detected using an Applied Biosystems 7500
Real Time PCR System. The sequences of qPCR primers used
for mRNA quantification were as follows: 5’-AGCCCTGGCTATATCCGACA-3’ and 5’-GAGGTCCAGGAAAGCCGAAA-3’ for mouse Hax-1 and 5’-TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA-3’ and 5’-TTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAG-3’ for
mouse GAPDH. Relative genomic expression was calculated
by the 2-ΔΔCt method.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was assessed with a MTT assay. N2a cells
overexpressing Hax-1 or treated with UCF-101 were incubated with 0.5 mg/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) at 37 °C for 2 h. Then,
150 μL of dimethylsulfoxide was added to stop the reaction.
The absorbance was measured at 570 nm to determine cell
viability.

Infarct volume measurement
Brain infarct volume was determined 24 h after reperfusion.
Mice were euthanized, and each brain was cut into five coronal slices (2-mm thick) with a brain-cutting matrix. The slices
were stained with 1% TTC at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark.
Normal tissues were stained (red) and infarct tissues were not
stained (white). The slices were mounted to dry paper and
photographed with a scanner. The percentage of the infarct
volume was quantified using Image-Proplus software, which
calculated the ratio of infarct volumes to the total contralateral
hemispheric volume. The ratios were multiplied by 100.
Plasmids
The Hax-1 related constructs were generated as previously
described[24]. Briefly, full length Hax-1 cDNA was amplified
from a human fetal brain library (Invitrogen) with the primers
5’-GCGAATTCACCATGAGCCTCTTTGATCTCTTC-3’ and
5’-ATGTCGACATCCGGGACCGGAACCAACGTCCC-3’,
and inserted into a pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA,
USA) vector at the Hind III and Sal I sites.
RNA interference
The oligonucleotide target sequences to Omi (si-Omi) or
the negative control siRNA (si-NC) have been previously
described[17, 25]. The oligonucleotides were transfected with
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoblot analysis and antibodies
Cells or tissue homogenates of ischemic or control brain hemispheres were lysed in 1× SDS lysis buffer (25 mmol/L TrisHCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40, and 1% sodium
deoxycholate) in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Approximately 20 μg of cell
lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a
PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Immunoblot analyses were performed with the following primary
antibodies: anti-Hax-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA), anti-Omi (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA
or prepared by our laboratory), anti-Tom20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175, Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). The secondary antibodies,
sheep anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, were from Thermo
Fisher Scientific. The proteins were visualized using an ECL
detection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Immunofluorescence
Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min
at room temperature, washed with PBS three times and permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min. Thirty
minutes after pre-blocking with 0.5% fetal bovine serum, cells
were incubated with anti-Omi, anti-GFP or anti-Tom20 antibody for 6 h, followed by an incubation with rhodamine (red)or FITC (green)-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 2 h. The cells were then stained with

DAPI (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for 2 min. Finally, the cells
were observed using an inverted IX71 microscope system
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Hoechst staining assays
N2a cells overexpressing Hax-1 or treated with UCF-101 were
incubated with Hoechst 33342 for 5 min and then washed with
PBS. The cells were observed using an inverted IX71 microscope system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Mitochondrial membrane potential measurement
To measure the mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψm),
cells were incubated with 100 nmol/L tetramethylrhodamine
methyl ester (TMRM) in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C. TMRM is
readily sequestered by normal mitochondria, but its fluorescence is rapidly lost when ∆Ψm is lost. After incubation, the
cells were washed once with PBS and then resuspended in
PBS. Finally, the cells were observed with an inverted IX71
microscope system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical analysis
Densitometric analyses of immunoblots from three independent experiments were performed using Photoshop 7.0
(Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA). The data were analyzed using
Origin 6.0 (Originlab, Northampton, MA, USA). Quantitative
data are presented as the mean±SEM. Statistical significance
was assessed via one-way ANOVA and the criterion of significance was set at P<0.05.

Results

Cleavage of Hax-1 by Omi after ischemia/reperfusion
Previous studies have shown that Omi levels increased and
Hax-1 levels decreased in the penumbra after I/R [22]. To
explore how Omi regulates Hax-1 after I/R, we first examined the protein levels of Omi and Hax-1 in the penumbra of
MCAO mouse brains 24 h after I/R. Consistent with the previous findings[22], protein levels of Omi were increased (Figure
1A), while Hax-1 levels were decreased (Figure 1B). In addition, although Hax-1 protein levels were decreased in cells
exposed to OGD/R (Figure 1C), transcription of Hax-1 was
not altered (Figure 1D), suggesting a post-translational process
of Hax-1. As we previously found that Omi cleaves Hax-1[24]
and that Hax-1 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway after apoptotic stimulation[26], we performed experiments
using a cellular OGD/R model to address how Omi regulates
Hax-1 after I/R. In N2a cells that were exposed to OGD/R, an
increase of Omi and a decrease of Hax-1 were observed, however, Hax-1 protein levels were dramatically increased after
Omi was knocked down (Figure 1E), suggesting that Omi possibly processes Hax-1. We further examined the Hax-1 levels
in OGD/R cells with or without the administration of the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 or the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) to differentiate Hax-1 degradation pathways.
MG132 or BafA1 did not block the degradation of Hax-1 (Figure 1F), further supporting that Hax-1 is processed by Omi but
not degraded by the proteasomal or lysosomal pathway.

Involvement of Hax-1 in the protective effects against OGD/
R-induced neuronal injury
As Hax-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein belonging to Bcl-2
family, we questioned whether a decrease of Hax-1 level is
associated with cell death induced by OGD/R. Therefore,
we overexpressed EGFP alone or EGFP-tagged Hax-1 and
evaluated cell viability after OGD/R. Significant cell death

was observed in EGFP alone transfected cells after OGD/R;
however, overexpression of EGFP-Hax-1 significantly blocked
OGD/R-induced cell death (Figure 2A).
We have shown that there is a correlation between Omi
and Hax-1 levels (Figure 1). We questioned whether
OGD/R-induced cell death mediated by the regulation of
Hax-1 is associated with the increase of Omi and Omi protease

activity. We treated the OGD/R cells with UCF-101, an Omi
protease inhibitor, and examined cell viability after OGD/R.
In cells exposed to OGD/R, there was a decrease of cell viability and Hax-1 protein levels along with an increase of Omi
levels; however, inhibition of Omi protease activity by UCF101 greatly restored cell viability and Hax-1 levels after OGD/R
(Figure 2B).
Maintenance of mitochondrial integrity by Hax-1 in OGD/R cells
Mitochondria are important cellular organelles that are
involved in neuronal cell death after I/R by releasing cytochrome c [13]. Because Hax-1 is decreased in OGD/R cells
as well as in the brains after I/R (Figure 1), we questioned
whether the increase of Omi and the decrease of Hax-1 are
associated with mitochondrial damage in OGD/R cells. Omi
and Hax-1 both localize to mitochondria, as shown by colocalization with mitochondrial protein Tom20 (Figure 3A
and 3B). In normoxic cells, inhibition of Omi protease activ-

ity by UCF-101 did not affect the mitochondrial membrane
potential (Figure 3C). In OGD/R cells, there was a significant
decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, indicated
by TMRM staining (Figure 3C). However, administration of
UCF-101 significantly restored the mitochondrial membrane
potential (Figure 3C). Moreover, overexpression of Hax-1
also restored the mitochondrial membrane potential in OGD/R
cells, showing a similar effect as UCF-101 treatment (Figure
3D). These data suggest that an inhibition of Omi protease
activity or overexpression of Hax-1 is able to maintain mitochondrial integrity against OGD/R injury. Next, we examined
whether an inhibition of Omi protease activity or overexpression of Hax-1 protects OGD/R cells against apoptosis. After
OGD/R, a majority of the cells presented condensed nuclei
(Figure 4A and 4B), whereas, only a small portion of OGD/R
cells presented apoptotic features after administration of
UCF-101 (Figure 4A). Additionally, overexpression of Hax-1
significantly alleviated apoptotic changes induced by OGD/R

(Figure 4B). Consistent with the morphological data (Figure
4A and 4B), administration of UCF-101 (Figure 4C, left panel)
or overexpression of Hax-1 (Figure 4C, right panel) in OGD/R

cells decreased the levels of cleaved caspase-3. These data
further suggest that Hax-1 protects OGD/R cells against apoptosis.

Protective effects in MCAO mice by UCF-101
We have shown that the anti-apoptotic effects on OGD/R cells
were caused by an inhibition of Omi protease activity or overexpression of Hax-1 (Figure 3 and 4). Next, we questioned
whether inhibition of Omi could protect neurons against apoptosis and neurons in MCAO mice to survive. To answer it, we
examined Hax-1 expression in the penumbra after I/R. As
shown in Figure 5A, Hax-1 levels in the penumbra were dramatically decreased after I/R, but were significantly restored
by treatment with UCF-101. We then examined the cleavage
of caspase-3. The cleavage of caspase-3 was increased in the
penumbra after I/R but was blocked after an administration
of UCF-101 (Figure 5B). Thus, these data strongly suggest
that UCF-101 inhibits Omi activity to decrease the processing of Hax-1, leading to an inhibition of caspase-3 activation
in MCAO animals. Finally, we examined whether inhibition
of Omi had an effect on neuronal survival. Using TTC staining, we evaluated the infarct volume of MCAO mice treated
with vehicle or UCF-101 24 h after I/R. In comparison to the
sham group, MCAO mice with vehicle treatment presented an
average infarct volume of approximately 27% (27.22%±0.83%);
however, the average infarct volume in MCAO mice treated
with UCF-101 decreased to approximately 17% (17.31%±1.44%)

(Figure 5C), suggesting a protective effect of UCF-101.

Discussion

Although multiple factors are involved in neuronal cell death
after I/R, mitochondria-mediated apoptosis is one of the
intrinsic pathways critical for ischemic injury[27]. Mitochondria
are cellular organelles essential for many functions including oxidative phosphorylation, calcium homeostasis, ROS
management and apoptosis[28]. Depletion of energy stores by
I/R leads to a loss of membrane potential and a depolarization of neurons, which activate Ca2+ channels, resulting in an
elevation of free cytosolic Ca2+[29]. The depletion of energy
and elevation of Ca2+ promote the production of ROS, further
impairing mitochondria after I/R[30]. In addition, increased
Ca2+ stimulates calpain to cleave Bid to form tBid that binds to
pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax, Bad, and Bak after I/R[31].
The formation of tBid heterodimers with other pro-apoptotic
protein opens the mitochondrial permeability transition pore
(mPTP) and releases cytochrome c, thereby activating caspases, leading to apoptosis in the ischemic brain[32, 33].
The Bcl-2 protein family includes both anti-apoptotic (such
as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and pro-apoptotic proteins (such as Bax,
Bad and Bak). Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can form heterodimers with

pro-apoptotic protein to protect mitochondria against apoptotic stimulation by ischemia[7, 34]. Overexpression of Bcl-2[35]
or systemic delivery of Bcl-xL[36] blocks apoptosis inducing
factor (AIF) translocation, prevents caspase activation and
protects neurons after ischemia. Hax-1 is a mitochondrial
protein belonging to Bcl-2 family. It was reported that Hax-1
interacts with caspase-9 to repress caspase-9 activation in
myocytes[37], suggesting an anti-apoptotic effect. Importantly,
Hax-1 is critical for the regulation of mitochondrial membrane
potential during apoptosis[38, 39]. Peripheral blood neutrophils
derived from Hax-1-deficient patients displayed an abnormal
mitochondrial membrane potential and stem cells from these
patients showed a rapid loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential during apoptosis[40]. Most interestingly, restoration
of Hax-1 levels in myeloid progenitor cells from Hax-1-deficient patients by retroviral gene manipulation delays the loss
of mitochondrial membrane potential, making them have similar properties as the controls[40]. These studies suggest a role
of Hax-1 in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane potential. In our study, we found that Hax-1 is processed by Omi
after OGD/R or I/R. N2a cells after OGD/R showed apoptotic changes with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Inhibition of Omi activity or an overexpression of Hax-1
restored mitochondrial membrane potential and protected
cells from apoptosis. Moreover, inhibition of Omi’s protease
activity in MCAO mice increased Hax-1 levels and decreases
the infarct volume. Thus, our data suggest that Hax-1 levels
are critical for maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential
to protect neurons against apoptosis after I/R.
The levels of Omi and Hax-1 are inversely altered after
I/R[22] and both are localized to mitochondria. In our study,
we demonstrate that Omi processes Hax-1 after OGD/R or
I/R to induce apoptosis. Blocking Omi enzyme activity, similar to Hax-1 overexpression, significantly inhibits caspase-3
and protects neurons against OGD/R or I/R-induced injury.
Thus, we propose that after I/R, Omi first affects proteins on
mitochondria before it is released to cytosol to cleave cytosolic
substrates.
In summary, our findings reveal a role of Omi in ischemia/
reperfusion-induced apoptosis by its functioning on mitochondria to process the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein Hax-1.
