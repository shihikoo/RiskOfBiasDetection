SUMMARY
Aims: This study investigated whether anticerebral ischemia new drug, l-3-n-butylphthalide (l-NBP), improved behavioral recovery and enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis
after cerebral ischemia in rats. Methods and Results: The middle cerebral artery of rats
was blocked for 2 h. The daily oral administrations of 30 mg/kg l-NBP or vehicle were
begun from the second day until the rats were sacrificed. L-NBP treatment markedly
increased 5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus
(DG) of injured hemisphere on day 28 after ischemia. The amount of newborn cells and
newly mature neurons was also increased. The expressions of growth-associated protein-43
and synaptophysin were significantly elevated in l-NBP-treated rats. However, l-NBP markedly reduced the percentage of BrdU+/GFAP+ cells. Additionally, the levels of catalytical
subunit of protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase B (Akt), and cAMP response elementbinding protein (CREB) were significantly increased, and the activation of the signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the expressions of cleaved caspase-3
and Bax were obviously inhibited by l-NBP. Consequently, l-NBP attenuated the behavioral
dysfunction. Conclusions: It first demonstrates that l-NBP may improve the behavioral
outcome of cerebral ischemia by promoting neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Activation of
CREB and Akt and inhibition of STAT3 signaling might be involved in.

Introduction
Stroke is the most fatal reason for permanent disability all over
the world [1]. The strategy of recovering brain function after
ischemic insult is attracting more and more attentions. A number
of evidence suggests that ischemic significantly increases neurogenesis in the rodent subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus
(DG) of the hippocampus and subventricular zone (SVZ) [2]. The
ischemia-induced newborn precursors might migrate into the
damaged stratum and become mature neurons [3]. But, neuronal
stem cells (NSCs) proliferation in the DG reached peak after
7 days. Then, the majority died within several weeks after cerebral ischemic. The survival rate of newly generated cells is very
low [4]. It indicates that the therapeutics of increasing the survival
of NSCs might be beneficial.
It has been reported that traditional Chinese medicine or herbal
extracts might enhance neuronal neurogenesis and contribute to
functional rebuilt of cerebral ischemia, such as Ginkgo biloba [5],
Ginsenosides [6], puerarin [7], and tetramethylpyrazine [8].

However, these traditional Chinese medicines have been used
only as adjuvant treatment for stroke patients in clinic. The
approved antistroke drugs had not been reported to promote neurogenesis.
L-3-n-butylphthalide (l-NBP) was originally extracted from
the seeds of Apium graveolens Linn. Soon, the racemic 3-nbutylphthalide (dl-NBP) was chemically synthesized. Stroke
patients in China have used dl-NBP from 2002, and it has shown
good effective effect. Dl-NBP not only improved acute syndrome,
but also contributed to recover the stroke-related disability, such
as walking, limb motor, language, sensor, thinking, and memory
[9]. Our previous studies found that the neuroprotective function of l-NBP was similar to or excel than that of dl-NBP. It has
been reported that long-term functional recovery and hippocampus-dependent memory after cerebral ischemia were closely
associated with hippocampal neurogenesis [10,11]. L-NBP could
reverse cognitive impairments in animal model with chronic
cerebral ischemia [12,13]. It is little known whether the effect of
NBP on improving functional recovery is related to neurogenesis

after ischemic insult. L-NBP, the origin of NBP, is a natural
product and shows more potential in stroke therapeutic. Thus,
we are planning to examine whether l-NBP could enhance hippocampal neurogenesis after focal cerebral ischemia with rat
model.

Materials and Methods
Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion in Rats
The male Sprague Dawley rats of 8 weeks old were obtained from
the Experimental Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Medical
Science (Beijing, China). We used 400 mg/kg chloral hydrate to
anaesthetize rats. Then, a nylon monofilament suture of 4-0 was
inserted by the external carotid stump into the internal carotid
artery of rats. After 2 h, the suture was withdrawn and the circulation was recovered (MCAO). The sham rats underwent the same
surgery except the filament insertion. The experimental protocols
were approved by institutional guidelines of the Experimental
Animal Center of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.

Drug Administration and Experimental Design
L-NBP (purity >99.5%) was obtained from Institute of Materia
Medica and diluted in vegetable oil. The experiment included
three groups: the sham group, the ischemic group, and the l-NBP
group. The daily oral administrations of 30 mg/kg l-NBP or vehicle were begun from the day after surgery until animals were sacrificed. Sham rats were given an equivalent volume of vegetable
oil. To examine whether l-NBP increases neurogenesis, 50 mg/kg
5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered twice every
day at 8-h intervals by i.p. injection. The details about the experimental schedule are described in Figure 1.

as 60 second. Each rat was permitted to stand on the platform for
30 second before the experimenter took it from the water.

Immunofluorescence Staining

Behavioral Test
Limb-placing Test
The limb-placing test was carried out before surgery and on postoperative days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 28 according to the reported
method with minor modifications [14]. The experiment included
7 limb-placing tests to check the sensorimotor function of forelimb
and hindlimb to sensitivity and proprioceptive stimulation. The
detail is shown in Data S1.

The rats were transcardially perfused with saline, and followed by
4% paraformaldehyde on days 7, 14, or 28 after MCAO. We took
the rats’ brains out and put them in the paraformaldehyde solution. The cryostat sections (40 lm) were cut coronally using a
Leica microtome. Five coronal brain sections per DG, spaced
400 lm apart, were selected. For BrdU staining, the method was
simply modified according to the previous description [16]. The
amount of BrdU+/NeuN+ and BrdU+/GFAP+ cells was determined
by fluorescence confocal microscopy (BX61; Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan).

Morris Water Maze Task
Morris water maze task [15] was begun from day 29 to day 33 after
cerebral ischemia. The protocol followed the previous report [12].
Every animal was trained twice each day for 5 days. The intertrial
interval was 1 min. Rats were slightly placed into the water
from the wall of the pool. We recoded the swimming paths of rats
by a video camera with a computer through an image analyzer.
The escape latency of finding the hidden platform was determined.
The whole time was 60 second. If the rat cannot find the hidden
platform during 60 second, the rat was guided to the hidden platform by the experimenter. And the escape latency was considered

Western Blots
We homogenized the brain tissues in Tris buffer. Then, the homogenate was centrifuged at 15000 g at 4°C for 15 min. Fifty-microgram protein samples were loaded and performed electrophoresis
and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membrane was blocked with blocking solution and incubated with primary antibodies overnight. We have listed the primary antibodies
in Table 1. On the second day, the membranes were reacted with
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Then, an enhanced chemiluminescence kit was used to detect the signals.

a peak at postischemic day 7 and then decreased at
postischemic day 14, but the amount was still high compared
to sham group. The cell birth returned to the original level in
the DG of injured hemisphere 28 days after MCAO. In contrast, BrdU+ cell in the DG was robustly raised by l-NBP treatment on days 7, 14, and 28 after MCAO. Particulary on day
28 after surgery, the BrdU+ cells were about onefold higher,
respectively, in the l-NBP treatment group, compared to the
vehicle group.

L-NBP Enhanced the Newborn Cells Survival
We treated rats with l-NBP for 28 days and BrdU for 2 days (days
1–2 after surgery), to observe the influence of l-NBP on the cell fate.
The BrdU+ cells in the vehicle group were a little bit more than that
in the sham group. Interesting, the number of BrdU+ cells was
markedly raised in the l-NBP group compared to the vehicle or
sham rats (Figure 3). Moreover, most of BrdU+ cells were shown in
the granular cell layer. The data suggested that l-NBP treatment
increased newly born cells survival in the DG region after ischemia.

L-NBP Regulated the Differentiation of Newborn
Neurons and Synapse Functions
In this study, we found that approximately 80% of the BrdU+ cells
in the DG of injured hemisphere were colocated with NeuN. However, only 10% of the BrdU+ cells were colocated with GFAP
28 days after MCAO in vehicle and sham groups. BrdU+ cells in
the vehicle-treated rats were similar to that in the sham-operated
rats. Furthermore, the effect of l-NBP on the differentiation of
newborn cells towards neuron and astrocyte was evaluated in the
DG of injured hemisphere. A markedly rise of BrdU+/NeuN+ cells
and a robust reduction in the percentage of BrdU+/GFAP+ cells
were determined in l-NBP-treated rats. Moreover, there was no
difference in the ratio of BrdU+/NeuN+ cells and the number of
BrdU+/GFAP+ cells in vehicle- and l-NBP-treated rats (Figure 4A
and B). It indicated that l-NBP promoted neurogenesis but not
astrogliogenesis after cerebral ischemia of rat model.
GAP-43 and SYN are the most established and widely used synaptic proteins and take part in the development of nerve synapses and
adjust plasticity of nerve synapses [17]. Here, the expressions of
GAP-43 and SYN were markedly downregulated in the vehicle-treated rats at postischemic day 28. However, l-NBP obviously increased
GAP-43 and SYN expressions (Figure 4C). It indicated that l-NBP

treatment promoted neurogenesis and neuroplasticity as well as suppressed astrogliogenesis in the DG of injured hemisphere.

L-NBP Promoted Sensorimotor and Cognitive
Functions Recovery
All cerebral ischemia rats showed initial severe sensorimotor
dysfunction by checking the limb-placing test, and accompanied
by gradual recovery. The difference of the scores of limb-placing
test between sham and vehicle groups was obvious at all time
points. The cerebral ischemia rats treated with l-NBP immediately showed an improved score after the first treatment until
day 7 after operation (Figure 5A). The Morris water maze task
showed that vehicle rats spent more time to look for the hidden
platform compared to sham group. However, l-NBP-treated rats
attained a significantly lower time to search the platform compared to vehicle rats (Figure 5B). It indicated that l-NBP treatment
could induce the beneficial effect for improvement of sensorimotor and cognitive function in a focal cerebral ischemia model.

L-NBP Promoted Neurogenesis by Regulating
PKA/BDNF/CREB and STAT3 Signaling Pathway
The expression of the catalytical subunit of PKA was nonsignificantly changed in the vehicle rats. But, l-NBP increased the level
of the catalytic subunit of PKA compared to the vehicle group
(Figure 6A). The level of phosphor-CREB (Ser133) was stable
between the vehicle-treated and sham-operated rats. However,
l-NBP treatment increased the levels of phosphor-CREB (Ser133)
compared to vehicle group. The total CREB levels were not shown
difference among the groups at postischemic day 28 (Figure 6B).
Moreover, a marked decrease of BDNF was shown in vehicletreated group compared to sham group. However, l-NBP
increased BDNF levels by 25.60% at postischemic day 28 compared to the vehicle treatment (Figure 6C). The important feature
of STAT3 during the neural development is promoting astrogliogenesis [18]. During 12 h after cerebral ischemia, the level of
phosphorylated STAT3 at Tyr705 was enhanced [19]. We found
that the phosphor-STAT3 (Tyr705) level was markedly increased
in the vehicle-treated rats at postischemic day 28. At the meantime, the expression of phosphor-STAT3 (Tyr705) was almost not
detected in the l-NBP treatment rats. The expressions of total
STAT3 were similar among the groups (Figure 6D). These results
showed that l-NBP inhibited STAT3 activity after ischemia.

L-NBP Inhibited Neuronal Apoptotic by
Regulating Akt Signaling Pathway
The level of phosphor-Akt was similar in the hippocampus
between vehicle group and sham group. L-NBP markedly
increased the phosphor-Akt (Ser473) at postischemic day 28. The
total Akt levels were not shown difference among the groups
(Figure 7A). It has been demonstrated that Akt can suppress the
conformational variety of Bax and the following translocation to
mitochondria; therefore, the apoptosis-related signaling pathway
was inhibited [20]. We found that the activity of cleaved caspase3 was markedly increased, but the levels of Bax and Bcl-2 had no
obvious changes after ischemia between the vehicle rats and the
sham rats. However, l-NBP treatment significantly reduced

cleaved caspase-3 and Bax levels. Meanwhile, l-NBP treatment
did not affect the Bcl-2 expression (Figure 7B). It suggested that lNBP treatment might inhibit neuronal apoptosis by regulating Akt
signaling pathway.

Discussion
Cerebral ischemic is the most important reason of high mortality
and morbidity. In recent twenty years, the neuroprotective agents
have been considered potential in stroke treatment but without
successful example. Therefore, finding new neuroprotectants that
activate endogenous NSC to substitute neurons loss after ischemia
might be a new strategy for the stroke therapeutics. The positive

l-NBP Promotes Neurogenesis and Neuroplasticity

effect of l-NBP on cerebral ischemia by decreasing oxidative
damage, inhibiting inflammatory response, and reducing neuronal apoptosis had been demonstrated in multiple animal models
[21–23]. Here, we reported that l-NBP promoted the proliferation,
survival, and differentiation of newborn neural cells and increased
the neuroplasticity.
BrdU can bind to cellular DNA in S phase, and it had become a
widely accepted tool to check cell proliferation [24,25]. Our
results showed that BrdU+ cells were markedly raised and reached
a peak at postischemic day 7, then most of newborn cells underwent death, and cells birth reduced to the original level in the DG
of injured hemisphere 28 days after ischemia, consistently with
previous study [26]. Our data showed that l-NBP treatment for
4 weeks by oral administration obviously upregulated the amount
of BrdU+ cells in the DG of injured hemisphere, suggesting that lNBP could promote basal neurogenesis after ischemia in rats. At
the meantime, l-NBP significantly promoted sensorimotor and
cognitive functional recovery, indicating that l-NBP might contribute to restore the permanent disability in stroke therapeutics.
Recent research showed that conditional depletion of neurogenesis could inhibit the functional recovery in the cerebral ischemic
animal model, suggesting that the neurogenesis in the early stage
of cerebral ischemia regulated the process of sensorimotor recovery [27]. Thus, the activity of l-NBP on functional recovery might
be attributed to l-NBP-induced newborn neurons survival in the
hippocampus. In addition, our results exhibited that l-NBP treatment markedly upregulated the expressions of both GAP-43 and
SYN compared to the vehicle group. It indicated that l-NBP might
improve the neuroplasticity in the hippocampus of injured hemisphere.
Cyclic AMP activates PKA signaling and then leads to the release
of catalytical subunit of PKA. This subunit transfers to the nucleus
where it results in CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 [28]. It is well
known that hippocampal cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling plays an
important role in memory formation [29]. The previous study
demonstrated that restrain of the CREB by a CREB-dominant negative mutant could block hippocampal neurogenesis in the DG
region after focal cerebral ischemia. It indicates that CREB may
contribute to the newborn neurons survival in the hippocampus.
It is well known that BNDF supplies a helpful condition to the
newborn cells of the hippocampal DG. Thus, BDNF might involve
in CREB-regulated newborn neurons survival [30]. In our results,
l-NBP-mediated CREB activation resulted in BDNF release and
then facilitated sensorimotor function reestablishment by promoting hippocampal newborn neurons survival after focal cerebral

ischemia. At the meantime, BDNF can enhance the expressions of
GAP-43 and SYN [31]. Therefore, l-NBP treatment might increase
the newborn neurons survival and neuroplasticity through PKA
signaling pathway by increasing CREB activity and upregulating
BDNF expression. The inhibition of STAT3 had been demonstrated
to promote the neurogenesis and restrained the astrogliogenesis in
NSC [32]. Our results exhibited that l-NBP markedly inhibited
STAT3 activity in the hippocampus of injured hemisphere. Consequently, the STAT3 pathway might contribute to the l-NBP-stimulated increase of newborn neurons and no effect on newborn
GFAP cells of the DG of injured hemisphere in rats.
Akt signaling pathway has been shown to closely associate
with the cell survival by suppressing the activation of some
proapoptotic proteins. At the meantime, Akt signaling pathway
also contributes to postconditioning’s protection against [33]. LNBP had been demonstrated to protect Ab- and H2O2-induced
cellular damage by regulating Bcl-2/Bax expressions and
inhibiting caspase-3 activation [34,35]. In the present experiment, l-NBP markedly raised Akt activity and downregulated
caspase-3 activity and the level of Bax in the hippocampus of
injured hemisphere. In addition, PKA/CREB signaling pathway
was reported to inhibit neuronal apoptosis by enhancing Bcl-2
expression [29]. It indicated that l-NBP treatment might rely on
functional activation of PKA and Akt prosurvival pathways via
inactivation of proapoptotic proteins to promote the survival of
newborn neuronal cells.
This work represents the first preclinical study demonstrating the effect of l-NBP on neurogenesis and neuroplasticity
after cerebral ischemic. The finding provides a further evidence that l-NBP promotes functional recovery after cerebral
ischemia and proposes the hypothesis that the long-term
application of l-NBP may contribute to alleviate the disability
after stroke.
