attenuates postischemic damage

The role of P2X7 receptors and pannexin-1 channels in ischemic damage remains controversial. Here, we analyzed their
contribution to postanoxic depolarization after ischemia in cultured neurons and in brain slices. We observed that pharmacological
blockade of P2X7 receptors or pannexin-1 channels delayed the onset of postanoxic currents and reduced their slope, and that
simultaneous inhibition did not further enhance the effects of blocking either one. These results were conﬁrmed in acute cortical
slices from P2X7 and pannexin-1 knockout mice. Oxygen-glucose deprivation in cortical organotypic cultures caused neuronal
death that was reduced with P2X7 and pannexin-1 blockers as well as in organotypic cultures derived from mice lacking P2X7 and
pannexin 1. Subsequently, we used transient middle cerebral artery occlusion to monitor the neuroprotective effect of those drugs
in vivo. We found that P2X7 and pannexin-1 antagonists, and their ablation in knockout mice, substantially attenuated the motor
symptoms and reduced the infarct volume to ~ 50% of that in vehicle-treated or wild-type animals. These results show that P2X7
receptors and pannexin-1 channels are major mediators of postanoxic depolarization in neurons and of brain damage after
ischemia, and that they operate in the same deleterious signaling cascade leading to neuronal and tissue demise.

INTRODUCTION
Ischemia causes postanoxic depolarization of neurons, which
subsequently leads to excessive release of neurotransmitters, such
as glutamate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), in neurons and
nonneuronal cells and ensuing excitotoxicity.1–5 ATP release
activates ionotropic P2X7 receptors (P2X7r) that act as Ca2+
-channels6 and which are expressed throughout the central and
peripheral nervous systems.7,8 High extracellular levels of ATP
promote the overactivation of P2X7r and neuronal death.9
Furthermore, overactivation of P2X7r can cause the formation of
a large pore, and further release ATP into the extracellular
medium.10,11 Alternatively, a role in ATP release has also been
assigned to membrane channels formed by pannexin 1 (Panx1),
which are large-pore ion channels with broad expression in the
CNS. Panx1 is permeable to molecules up to 900 Da and directly
mediates ATP release.12,13 Panx1 is expressed in pyramidal neurons
at the postsynaptic density14–16 and is activated after NMDA
receptor stimulation, where it can contribute to bursting patterns
in the hippocampus.17 The mechanisms by which P2X7r and Panx1
are involved in the pathology of ischemia are the subject of intense
debate. However, it has been previously shown that P2X7r
inhibition provides protection against cerebral ischemia9 and that
the participation Panx1 opening and during this injury.18

In this study, we have investigated the contribution of both,
P2X7r and Panx1, to postanoxic depolarization and cell death
during cerebral ischemia. We found that the independent or joint
pharmacological inhibition of Panx1 or P2X7r, provides similar
protection in ischemia. The protective effects of speciﬁc blockers
were corroborated using knockout (KO) animals for P2X7r and
Panx1, underlining their therapeutic potential for cerebral ischemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Organotypic cultures, primary cultures, acute slices and middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) protocols using mice and rats, wild-type or P2X7
and Panx1 KO mice, were approved by the Comité de Ética y Bienestar
Animal (Animals Ethics and Welfare Committee) of the University of the
Basque Country. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the
Directives of the European Union on animal ethics and welfare.

and 5% CO2 in B27 Neurobasal medium plus (Life Technologies, Madrid,
Spain) 10% fetal bovine serum. The medium was replaced by serum-free,
B27-supplemented Neurobasal medium 24 hours later. Cultures were used
at 8 to 14 days in vitro. For electrophysiology monitoring in cultured
neurons, in vitro ischemia was induced chemically using the glycolytic
blocker iodoacetate (IAA, 1 mmol/L), the oxidative phosphorylation
inhibitor antimycin (0.25 μmol/L), and replacing glucose with sucrose in
the external solution to electrophysiologic records.

Brain Slices
Animals (20- to 30-day old C57 male mice) were anesthetized with
isoﬂuorane. Then, brain slices (coronal sections of 300 μm) were prepared
on a vibratome (Pelco 100, Pelco, Clovis, CA, USA) in ice-cold artiﬁcial
cerebrospinal ﬂuid containing (in mmol/L): NaCl (126), NaHCO3 (24),
NaH2PO4 (1), KCl (2.5), CaCl2 (2.5), MgCl2 (2), and D-glucose (10; bubbled
with 95% O2/5% CO2) at pH 7.4. After collection, slices were transferred to
an artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid solution at 37°C, for at least 1 hour, after
slices were transferred at recording chamber in electrophysiology set-up.
Ischemia in brain slices was mimicked by replacing glucose in the artiﬁcial
cerebrospinal ﬂuid with 10 mmol/L sucrose and bubbling continuously
with 95% N/5% CO2. The artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid and Ischemia
solutions was maintained at 37°C during recording.

Electrophysiology
Whole-cell patch clamp recordings, of cultured neurons or brains slices,
were performed in a Multiclamp 700B ampliﬁer (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Neurons were held at − 70 mV and constantly
perfused with external solution containing (in mmol/L), NaCl (150), KCl (5),
CaCl2 (2.5), MgCl2 (1), HEPES (10), and glucose (10), pH 7.3 (NaOH). Wholecell patch clamp recordings in slices were made in layer V pyramidal
neurons of motor cortex region, using electrodes of 4 to 6 MΩ resistance.
The pipette solution contained (in mmol/L), potassium gluconate (140),
CaCl2 (1), MgCl2 (2), HEPES (10), EGTA (10), Na-GTP (0.2), and Mg-ATP (2),
pH 7.3 (KOH). Data were digitized at 2 kHz and lowpass ﬁltered at 2kHz. In
brain slices, continuous perfusion (1.5 mL/min) was performed with an

external solution (bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2) containing (in mmol/L)
NaCl (126), KCl (2.5), CaCl2 (2.5), MgCl2 (2), and D-glucose (10), pH 7.3.
Perfusion of BBG (Blue Brillant G), A438079 or probenecid after the onset of
postanoxic ion currents in culture neurons was performed at 3 mL/min.

Preparation of Organotypic Cultures
Brains of 5-day-old mice were removed and the two hemispheres
separated in Hank's balanced salt solution. Thalamus and midbrain were
removed and each hemisphere sliced with a tissue chopper (McIlwain
tissue chopper) (Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA) to obtain cortical coronal
slices of 400 μm of thickness. One slice was plated on each Millicell CM
culture inserts (Millipore Ibérica, Madrid, Spain) and maintained in
Neurobasal medium supplemented with 0.5% B27, 25% horse serum and
25 mg/mL gentamicin at 37°C. Experiments were performed after 7 to
10 days in vitro. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was performed for
60 minutes in an N2-saturated environment in the glucose-free medium
(120 mmol/L NaCl, 4 mmol/L KCl, 2 mmol/L MgSO4, 2 mmol/L CaCl2, 2
mmol/L KH2PO4, and 2 mg/mL mannitol, pH 7.4) previously saturated with
95% N2. After OGD, organotypic cultures were maintained in Neurobasal
medium for 24 hours under normoxic conditions. For evaluation of cell
death slices in culture were stained for 2 hours with 10 μmol/L propidium
iodide, which stain only dead cells, and visualized with the camera
attached to Nikon AZ100 ﬂuorescence microscope (Barcelona, Spain). Cell
death was evaluated by densitometry assay after normalization with the
area of the slice using the cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Diagnostics).

Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Transient focal ischemia was induced by MCAO in male wild-type C57BL/6
or KO mice (25 to 32 g body weight) using the intraluminal ﬁlament
technique adapted from the rat model.21 Mice were anesthetized with 4%
halothane in an anesthetic chamber and maintained during surgery with
1% to 1.5% isoﬂurane using a rodent mask. Body temperature was
maintained at 37°C with a heat pad. Middle cerebral artery occlusion was
performed for 60 minutes by inserting a 6-0 nylon monoﬁlament via the
right external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery to block the

origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The MCA occlusion was
conﬁrmed by measuring of local cerebral blood ﬂow using a laser-Doppler
ﬂowmeter (PeriFlux System 5000, Perimed AB, Sweden, Järfälla). Only mice
with blood ﬂow reduced by 480% were used for experiments. Shamoperated wild-type controls were surgically treated as the ischemic group,
but the middle cerebral artery was not occluded. The same procedure was
applied also on KO animals without any treatment.
The P2X7r inhibitor BBG, which crosses the blood-brain barrier,22 was
administrated intraperitoneally (30 mg/kg twice per day) beginning at
30 minutes after the onset of ischemia. The Panx1 blocker, meﬂoquine
(MFQ) was injected intraperitoneally once per day (1 mg/kg) starting 30
minutes after MCAO initiation. Another group of mice was treated with
MFQ (1 mg/kg) together with BBG (30 mg/kg) after 30 minutes of MCA
occlusion and later on with BBG (30 mg/kg twice per day) during three
days of reperfusion. Animals were euthanized 3 days after ischemia, the
brain was removed and infarct volume and number of degenerated
neurons were calculated as described below.

Neurologic Evaluation of the Effect of MCAO
To determine the level of neurologic condition caused by the MCAO, the
Bederson et al23 method was used, in which the following scores (0 to 4) is
established at 60 minutes after MCAO and, later, at intervals of 24 hours:
0 for undetectable neurologic deﬁcits; 1 for forelimb ﬂexion and torso
rotated toward the contralateral side when the animal is lifted by the
tail; 2 for the same deﬁcit grade 1 plus a decreased resistance to lateral
push; 3 for the same deﬁcit grade 2 plus unilateral move; and
4 no spontaneous walking and a depressed level of consciousness.
Animals with neurologic deﬁcits lower than score 2 were excluded from
the study.

sections, 1 mm thick, using a rat brain matrix (Activational Systems, MI,
USA). Analysis of cerebral ischemic damage was performed using TTC
(Sigma-Aldrich). The sections were stained by incubating them in a 1% TTC
solution in phosphate-buffered saline at 37°C for 15 minutes, washed and
then ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin overnight. Fixed sections were
scanned from anterior and posterior sides. The nonischemic hemisphere,
ischemic hemisphere, and infarct area of each brain section was measured
blinded to the phenotype and treatment, using ImageJ software (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The average infarct area (mm2) in
each section was calculated by the following formula: (infarct area on the
anterior surface+infarct area on the posterior surface)/2. Infarct volumes
(mm3) were calculated by the sum of all the section areas and multiplying
by the slice thickness. The corrected infarct volume to compensate
brain edema was calculated by applying the formula: (nonischemic
volume/ischemic volume) × infarct volume.25 Coronal cryosections after
TTC staining and ﬁxing were cryostat cut at 10 μm, sections mounted onto
gelatinized microscope slides, and stored at − 20°C until next staining with
FJ. Sections were air dried and stained with 0.0001% FJ for 20 minutes,
washed, dried, and coverslipped with DPX (24). The slides were examined
using Zeiss Axoplan microscope (Madrid, Spain) and images acquired
using a digital camera. Series of microphotographs were taken from four
region of the ipsilateral side, two parts of the cerebral cortex and two areas
from the striatum, with a × 20 objective and FJ-positive cells were counted
by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health; Image Pro Plus 7, Media
Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). Drawing (Figure 6B) shows the area
where FJ-positive-stained neurons were counted.

Statistical Analysis

Determination of Brain Infarct and Histologic Analysis

All data are reported as mean ± s.e.m. One-way analysis of variance test
with Bonferroni post hoc test were performed. Data were analyzed using
GraphPad Prism v. 4 (or Instat 3) software (GraphPad software, San Diego,
CA, USA) or Origin 8.1 (Microcal Software, Madrid, Spain).

Analysis of cerebral ischemic damage was performed using 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma-Aldrich, Madrid, Spain), FluoroJade C (FJ; Merck Millipore, Madrid, Spain) staining. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride stains dehydrogenases and its absence allows quantiﬁcation of the infarct area, whereas FJ (Madrid, Spain) is a marker for
degenerating neurons.24 The animals were euthanized after reperfusion,
under chloral hydrate anesthesia followed by decapitation. The brains
were rapidly dissected out and the forebrains cut into seven coronal

(OGD) as reported in the previous study.9 Thus, induction of ischemia
triggered an inward current that became evident 3.46 ± 1.07 minutes
later (Figures 1A and 1B). Application of P2X7r antagonists BBG

increased the latency up to 7.42 ± 2.03 and 7.20 ± 1.54 minutes,
respectively. In turn, Panx1 inhibitors carbenoxolone (100 μmol/L),
MFQ (100 nmol/L), and probenecid (1 mmol/L) similarly delayed the
start of the ischemic ionic current (7.79 ± 1.33, 7.89 ± 1.36, and

7.30 ± 1.69 minutes, respectively). Blocking simultaneously P2X7r
and Panx1 with MFQ together with BBG did not signiﬁcantly modify
the effects of each drug applied separately (latency was
7.54 ± 1.85 minutes).
Moreover, we measured the slope of the current induced by
ischemia and found that it was robustly reduced by blocking
P2X7r or Panx1 activation to ~ 40% of control, vehicle-treated
neurons, with no additional reduction with simultaneous application of both inhibitors (Figures 1A and 1C). Finally, P2X7r and
Panx1 blockers were effective in reversing the ischemic ionic
current when applied at its onset (Figure 2), suggesting that P2X7r
and Panx1 are activated during early ischemia and contribute to
the depolarization caused in neurons.
Blockade of P2X7 Receptors and Panx1 Channels Reduces the
Ionic Current Induced by Ischemia in Neurons in Acute Brain Slices
Since the procedures and time to establish neurons in vitro may
alter their membrane properties, we next examined the contribution of P2X7r and Panx1 to ischemic ionic current in cortical
neurons in acute brain slices. In this preparation, we observed that
ischemia induced ionic currents with a latency of 4.68 ± 1.18
minutes. However, in the presence of P2X7r antagonists BBG (50
nmol/L) or A43809 (1 μmol/L), the latency increased to 10.12 ± 2.44
and 8.52 ± 1.74 minutes, respectively (Figures 3A and 3B). Similarly,
Panx1 blockers carbenoxolone (100 μmol/L), MFQ (100 nmol/L),
and probenecid (1 mmol/L) also delayed the onset of currents to
9.44 ± 1.68, 8.24 ± 1.93, and 8.89 ± 1.91 minutes, respectively
(Figures 3A and 3B). Further support for these pharmacological
ﬁndings was obtained using acute brain slices from P2X7r and
Panx1 KO mice. As shown in Figure 3B, the latency of ischemic ionic
current of 4.68 ± 1.18 minutes measured in wild-type mice
increased to 9.84 ± 2.47 and 10.11 ± 2.46 minutes, in preparations
lacking P2X7r receptor and pannexin-1 channels, respectively.
Finally, we also found that the slope of ionic currents induced by
ischemia was signiﬁcantly reduced by 50% when blockers were
applied and in KO mice compared with those of controls
(Figure 3C). The combined application of the two types of blockers
and genetic deletion of P2X7r or Panx1 (BBG+MFQ, KOP2X7+MFQ,
and KOPanx1+BBG) did not yield a larger increase in the latency or
a higher reduction in the slope of the ischemic current as compared
with single pharmacological or genetic ablation of either P2X7r or
Panx1 (Figures 3B and 3C). Moreover, applying A43809 (1 μmol/L) or
MFQ (100 nmol/L) to slices obtained from KOP2X7 or KOPanx1
mice, respectively, did not show an additive effect on the onset of
ischemic currents (9.17 ± 1.54 and 9.82 ± 1.69, respectively) and in
the slope (50%) as compared with that observed without exposure
to these blockers (Figures 3B and C).
Blockade of P2X7r and Panx1 Reduces Oxygen-Glucose
Deprivation-Induced Cell Death in Organotipic Slices
Organotypic cortical slices cultured for 7 days were subjected to
60 minutes of OGD in the presence of P2X7r antagonist BBG
(50 nmol/L) or Panx1 blocker MFQ (1 μmol/L). Oxygen-glucose
deprivation-induced cell damaged in vehicle-treated slices was
diminished by both drugs, as assessed with propidium iodide
incorporation (Figure 4). Protection was also observed using the
NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 (50 μmol/L) as a positive
control. In addition, OGD induced cell damage in organotypic
slices derived from P2X7r or Panx1 KO mice was also attenuated,
as compared with slices obtained from wild-type mice (Figure 4).
Interestingly, BBG and MFQ did not reduce OGD damage in slices
derived from P2X7r and Panx1 KO mice, respectively (Figure 4).
Together, these results indicate that P2X7r and Panx1 blockade or
ablation similarly protect from OGD damage in organotypic
cultures.

Concomitant or Independent Blockade of P2X7r and Panx1 are
Protective After Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
To evaluate the relevance of the observations described above to
stroke, we explored the effect on postischemic damage after
transient MCAO of the P2X7 receptor antagonist BBG and of Panx1
blocker MFQ, alone and together, as well as after ablation of P2X7r
and Panx1 in KO mice.
The extent of brain damage after transient MCAO was greatly
reduced, as assessed using TTC, in KO mice as well as treating with
P2X7r antagonist BBG or with MFQ (Figure 5A). In control animals,
the volume of the damaged area was 55.6 ± 1.2 mm3 (n = 19)
at 3 days after 60 minutes MCAO, while in P2X7− / − mice it was
reduced to 28.5 ± 4.1 (n = 13). Similarly, Panx1− / − mice (n = 8)
infarct damage was diminished to 56% (24.02 ± 2.2 mm3). In
animals treated with BBG (n = 8), the infarct area was 27.2 ±
3.9 mm3 (51.1% reduction). Similarly, treatment with MFQ reduced
infarct damage to 26.45 ± 4.2 mm3 (n = 14). Interestingly, coapplication of both drugs did not cause further protection as compared
with single treatment. The infarct volume in this experimental
group was ~ 50% of that observed in vehicle-treated mice
(27.8 ± 5.7 mm3; n = 8; Figure 5B).
The neurologic score at 1 hour after initiation of reperfusion was
similar in all tested animals, positive control and KO mice, and
after administration of drugs (Figure 5C). Later on, the score

improved over time during reperfusion and was signiﬁcantly lower
in the mice of control group after 3 days of reperfusion. Notably,
the neurologic symptoms were greatly ameliorated in KO mice
and in mice treated with BBG as well as with MFQ at 1 day and
3 days after ischemia as compared with control mice (Figure 5C).
To quantify the number of degenerated neurons, we did cryostat
sections at the level of the center of the infarct area according to
TTC staining (typically slice 3 of TTC staining in Figure 6A), and
stained with FJ. Fluoro-Jade C staining of degenerated neurons
showed a large number of FJ-positive cells in the ischemic
core–positive control animals at 3 days after ischemia (715 ± 38
cells/mm2; Figure 6C). In contrast, animals subjected to stroke and
subsequently treated with BBG, MFQ, or MFQ+BBG as well as KO
mice displayed a lower number of positive-stained cells after 3 days
of recirculation (400 ± 36 cells/mm2, 329 ± 42 cells/mm2, 399 ±
16 cells/mm2, 387 ± 35 cells/mm2 P2X7− / −, and 374 ± 40 cells/mm2
Panx1− / −, respectively; Figure 6C).
DISCUSSION
Loss of membrane potential occurs during brain ischemia, which
leads to anoxic depolarization that promotes excitotoxic release of
glutamate and ATP. This phenomenon induces the activation of
ionotropic membrane receptors and, in the case of ATP, also the
opening of large-pore ion channels. In this study, we examined

P2X7 and pannexin 1 contribute to ischemic damage
A Cisneros-Mejorado et al

the contribution of the ionotropic P2X7 receptor and Panx1
channels on brain ion currents triggered by the ischemic
conditions. We found a partial reduction of these currents in both
cultured neurons and brain slices, when the activity of P2X7r and
Panx1 was blocked. Importantly, we also observed a reduction in
the percentage of cell death caused by ischemia in organotypic
slices when P2X7r or Panx1 are blocked or genetically deleted.
Finally, in a model of MCAO, we found a decrease in infarct
volume when P2X7r and Panx1 inhibitors where administered
after the onset of ischemia as well as in P2X7r and Panx1 KO
animals. These ﬁndings show that the activation of both P2X7r
receptors and the membrane channel Panx1 substantially
contributes to anoxic depolarization and cell death after brain
ischemia.
Adenosine triphosphate efﬂux in ischemia may be because of
anoxic cell depolarization, as characterized by a large increase in
membrane potential.26,27 Indeed, we found that these ischemic
ionic currents were partially blocked by inhibition of P2X7r,
consistent with a previous recent study by us9 and with the idea
that overactivation of P2X7r promotes massive efﬂux of molecules,
including ATP, up to 900 Da.11,28,29 This supports the notion that
P2X7r itself can release ATP in neurons because it has the ability to
operate in a mode of a mega pore because of dilation of the
receptor channel.30 Thus, inhibition of P2X7r would confer
protection against ATP-mediated excitotoxicity. However, an
alternative explanation for this ATP excitotoxic efﬂux during
ischemia is that a secondary ion channel releasing ATP, Panx1, can
be recruited and its opening modulate P2X7r activity.31–34 Indeed,
Panx1 is activated by ischemia in cultures of hippocampal and
cortical pyramidal neurons, and contributes to anoxic depolarization and neuronal death.18 In apparent contradiction with
those ﬁndings, a more recent study in acute hippocampal
slices showed that pannexin channels do not generate the
large inward current that underlies the anoxic depolarization and
that glutamate receptor channels remain the main candidate for
generating the large inward current that produces the anoxic
depolarization.35 At odds with the later study and consistent
with Thompson et al,18 we show that Panx1 activation robustly
contributes to the ischemic ionic currents in dissociated cultured
neurons and in acute slices using both pharmacology and
genetic tools. Interestingly, the increase of the latency of the
onset the ischemic ionic currents was similar when P2X7r and
Panx1 were blocked separately or simultaneously. This strongly
suggests that the activation of both P2X7 and Panx1 contributes
to postischemic depolarization by acting on the same signaling
cascade.
However, we observed that blockade of either P2X7r or Panx1
protects from cell death as a consequence of ischemia in both
organotypic cortical cultures and in vivo after transient MCAO. The
magnitude of protection of P2X7r antagonists and Panx1 blockers
was similar and was not further increased by inhibiting
concomitantly P2X7r and Panx1, which indicates that these two
channels lie in the same death-signaling cascade triggered by
ischemia. In accordance, the coexpression of Panx1 with P2X7r in
oocytes, but not of P2X7r alone, induces membrane permeabilization via activation of the purinergic death receptor, a complex
that, when activated, kills cells.32 Moreover, the effect that these
antagonists have on MCAO, where their administration is 30
minutes after the occlusion, might indicate that P2X7 receptor or
Panx1-channel inhibitors may reduce the propagation of spreading depression in the periinfarct area.36 This ﬁnding together
with our observations supports the idea that both P2X7r and
Panx1 are recruited during brain ischemia as well, and that both
channels constitute an amenable target for the prevention of
neuronal death.
The mechanisms by which Panx1 are activated during ischemia
remain unclear. In pyramidal neurons, Panx1 is activated after
NMDA receptor stimulation, where it can contribute to bursting

patterns in the hippocampus.17 In addition, ischemic events result
in overactivation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors that result in
neuronal death.37 Thus, in ischemia, pannexins might generate a
large inward current, producing the anoxic depolarization, either
because of a direct-activating effect of ischemia on pannexin as
seen in isolated pyramidal cells18 or as a consequence of
secondary channel opening produced by ischemia-evoked glutamate release.
In summary, we show that the P2X7r and Panx1 activation
substantially contribute to ischemic depolarization and cell
damage in in vitro and in vivo experimental paradigms relevant
to ischemia. Our ﬁndings indicate that P2X7r and Panx1 act
synergistically and that blockage of either one, alone or together,
confers similar robust neuroprotection. Therefore, targeting the
P2X7r-Panx1 duo may have a high therapeutic potential for
treating brain damage after ischemia.
