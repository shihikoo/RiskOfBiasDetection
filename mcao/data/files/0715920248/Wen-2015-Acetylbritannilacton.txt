Inflammatory responses play a critical role in ischemic brain injury. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and acetylbritannilactone (ABL) exerts potent antiinflammatory actions by inhibiting expression of inflammation-related genes. However, the functions of miR-155 and the actual relationship between ABL and miR-155 in ischemia-induced cerebral inflammation remain unclear. In this study, cerebral ischemia of wild-type (WT) and miR-155–/– mice was induced by permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). pAd-miR-155 was injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle 24 h before MCAO to induce miR-155 overexpression. MCAO mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated BV2 cells were used to examine the effects of ABL and miR-155 overexpression or deletion on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. We demonstrated that ABL
treatment significantly reduced neurological deficits and cerebral infarct volume by inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression in ischemic cerebral tissue and OGD-treated BV2 cells. Mechanistic studies suggested that the observed decrease in TNF-α and IL-1β expression was attributable to the ABL-induced suppression of the expression of nuclear factorkappa B (NF-κB) and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We further found that miR-155 promoted TNF-α and IL-1β expression by upregulating
TLR4 and downregulating the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and myeloid differentiation primary response
gene 88 (MyD88), while ABL exerted an inhibitory effect on miR-155-mediated gene expression. In conclusion, miR-155 mediates inflammatory responses in ischemic cerebral tissue by modulating TLR4/MyD88 and SOCS1 expression, and ABL exerts its antiinflammatory action by suppressing miR-155 expression, suggesting a novel miR-155-based therapy for ischemic stroke.

INTRODUCTION
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of
death and permanent disability that affects millions of people worldwide and
remains a major challenge to public
health. In addition to the primary hypoxic
damage and secondary processes, such
as excitotoxicity, inflammatory events
that occur during cerebral ischemia are
critical for the pathogenesis of tissue
damage in ischemic stroke (1,2). In ischemic brain injury, molecules released from

injured tissue, blood vessels and necrotic
cells activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs)
and induce production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β
(IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). These cytokines cause postischemic inflammation
in the brain, subsequently leading to exacerbated primary brain damage (3,4).
Previous work has demonstrated that activation of TLRs either by microbial or
endogenous ligands results in an inflam-

matory response by delivering a signal
from the intracellular TIR (Toll/IL-1 receptor) domain of TLR through a series
of intracellular adaptor molecules, including MyD88, interleukin-1 receptorassociated kinase (IRAK) and TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (5,6). For
example, IRAK and TRAF6 are recruited
to the TLR complex via interaction with
MyD88 (7) and activate nuclear factorkappa B (NF-κB), a transcription factor
that regulates the expression of a wide
array of genes involved in inflammatory
responses, as well as the mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs), such
as extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK), p38 and c-jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK) (8,9). However, the precise mechanism of cerebral ischemia-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines is
still not fully understood.
The expression of inflammation-related
genes can be regulated not only by tran-

scription factors at the transcriptional
level but also by microRNAs (miRNAs,
miRs) at the posttranscriptional level.
Emerging evidence suggest that miRNAs
are involved in regulating several aspects
of inflammation (10,11) and the response
to cerebral ischemia (12). Among various
miRNAs, miR-155 is an inflammation-related miRNA. Its expression is induced in
inflammatory macrophages (11,13), as
well as in the ischemic cerebral cortex by
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
surgery (14) and, in turn, it enhances
proinflammatory cytokine expression in
macrophages by regulating the NF-κB
signaling pathway (11,15). In addition,
miR-155 can exert both pro- and antiinflammatory effects by targeting different
mediators of inflammatory signaling,
such as SHIP1, SOCS1, SMAD2 and TAB2
(16,17). Given the importance of miR-155
in the development of postischemic brain
inflammation, understanding the role of
miR-155 and the mechanism of miR-155
actions in ischemic cerebral injury will
provide novel insights into ischemic
stroke therapy.
Pharmacological alleviation of inflammatory response is one of the most promising avenues for stroke therapy.
Acetylbritannilactone (ABL) is a new antiinflammatory compound isolated from
Inula britannica L., a traditional Chinese
medicinal herb (for its structure, see Figure 1A). Its chemical structure is different
from ergolide, which was isolated previously (18). Several of the previous studies
demonstrate that ABL inhibits the expression of inflammation-associated genes,
such as the NOS and COX-2 genes, by reducing IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation, inhibiting NF-κB activation and
blocking the binding of active NF-κB to
the target gene promoters in RAW 264.7
macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (19–21). In addition,
ABL also can suppress PDGF-induced
DNA synthesis and cell proliferation,
subsequently leading to apoptosis in proliferative VSMCs via the induction of a
higher ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, activation of
caspase-9/-3 and the cleavage of the endogenous substrate Poly (ADP-ribose)

polymerase (22). Although ABL exhibits
potent antiinflammatory and proapoptotic effects in macrophages and VSMCs,
the effects of ABL on cerebral ischemia
have not been evaluated. Simultaneously,
it also remains unclear whether antiinflammation effects of ABL on cerebral ischemia are mediated by miR-155. In this
study, we investigated whether and how
ABL exerts a protective effect on focal
cerebral ischemia-induced inflammation
by regulating miR-155 expression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental Animals
Adult male CD1 mice (25-30 g) and
male C57/BL6 mice (25-30 g) were purchased from the Vital River Laboratory
Animal Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing,
China. miR-155–/– mice (25-30 g) were
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, MN, USA). All mice were
given at least 3 d to acclimatize ahead of
any experimentation. During this period,
all mice had free access to food and
water. Animal houses were maintained in
a light–dark (12:12 h) cycle with humidity
of 60% ± 5% and ambient temperature of
22 ± 3°C. All experimental procedures

were approved by Hebei Medical University Ethics Committee as well as the institutional animal care and use committee.
Animal Surgery for Middle Cerebral
Artery Occlusion
A standard model of permanent right
middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) was established by following
the surgical procedures as previously described (23). In brief, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of
chloral hydrate (10%). The common
carotid artery (CCA) were exposed and
isolated. The middle cerebral artery
(MCA) was occluded by inserting a
heparin-dampened monofilament nylon
suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd.,
Beijing, China) into the internal carotid
artery (ICA), and advancing it further
until it closed the origin of the MCA.
Sham-operated mice underwent the
same surgical procedures except for filament insertion. Animal body temperature was monitored and maintained at
36.5°C to 37.5°C during the experiment.
Drug Administration
The ABL (Hebei Medical University,
Shijiazhuang, China) with purity of more

than 99.5% was freshly dissolved in 0.9%
NaCl including 1% Tween-80 prior to the
treatments. The drug or solvent was injected intraperitoneally 30 min prior to
MCAO operation.
Adenovirus Expression Vector and
Lateral Cerebral Ventricle (LV)
Injection
Adenoviruses harboring a DNA fragment encompassing the Mus musculus
(mmu)-miR-155 gene (pAd-miR-155) were
Invitrogen products (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
Briefly, DNA oligos encoding the mmumiR-155 (13MR0026-1F 5′-TGCTG
TTAATGCTAATTGTGATAGGGGTGT

CAATTAGCATTAA-3′; 13MR0026-1R

ATCACAATTAGCATTAAC-3′) were
cloned into pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR,
then pDONR221 gateway entry vector
by BP recombination reaction, and finally
pAD/CMV-DEST by LR recombination
reaction.
The stereotactic injections of adenoviral
construct (pAd or pAd-miR-155) into LV
were performed at coordinates –0.5 mm
anteroposterior, ± 1.5 mm mediolateral,
and –2.0 to –2.5 mm dorsoventral from
the bregma 24 h prior to MCAO.
Experimental Groups and Treatments
Experiment 1. All CD1 mice were randomly divided into five groups (n = 195,
39 mice in each group): (1) sham group:
animals received sham operation and
equal volume of 0.9% NaCl; (2) MCAO
group: animals received MCAO and
equal volume of 0.9% NaCl; (3) three
ABL treatment groups: animals underwent MCAO and were treated with a
high dose of ABL (30 mg/kg), middle
dose of ABL (20 mg/kg) or low dose of
ABL (10 mg/kg).
Experiment 2. All C57/BL6 mice were
randomly divided into eight groups (n =
264, 33 mice in each group): virus
groups: 10 μL (2 × 109 plaque-forming
units/mL) of adenoviral construct (pAd
or pAd-miR-155) was injected stereotacti-

cally into LV of C57/BL6 mice 24 h before MCAO, 20 mg/kg ABL or 0.9%
NaCl was injected intraperitoneally
30 min before MCAO; KO groups:
20 mg/kg ABL or 0.9% NaCl was injected intraperitoneally in miR-155–/–
mice or wild-type (WT) C57/BL6 mice
30 min before MCAO operation.
Neurological Deficit Score
A neurological test was administered
by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups at 24 h after MCAO following a modified scoring system developed by Longa et al. as follows: 0, no
deficits; 1, difficulty in fully extending
the contralateral forelimb; 2, inability to
extend the contralateral forelimb; 3, mild
circling to the contralateral side; 4, severe
circling; 5, falling to the contralateral side
(n = 10 in each group). The higher the
neurological deficit score, the more severe impairment of motor motion injury.
Brain Infarct Volume
Infarct volume of brain was measured
24 h after MCAO. After the brains (n = 6
in each group) were dissected, each brain
sample was sliced into five slices with
2-mm thickness, incubated by a 2% solution of 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA)
at 37°C for 15 min, followed by fixation
with 4% paraformaldehyde. With TTC
staining, all normal tissue was stained in
dark red, while the infarct area was
stained in pale gray color. TTC-stained
slices were then photographed and analyzed using Image-Pro Plus 5.1 software
(Media Cybernetics Inc., Bethesda, MD,
USA), and the infarct volumes were calculated as follows: percentage hemisphere
lesion volume (% HLV) = {[total infarct
volume – (volume of intact ipsilateral
hemisphere – volume of intact contralateral
hemisphere)]/contralateral hemisphere
volume} × 100% (24).
Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemical staining,
brain tissues were removed and immediately immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS;

0.01 mol/L, pH 7.4) for 24 h at 4°C and
then dehydrated in a graded series of alcohols and embedded in paraffin. Brain
sections (5 μm thick) were blocked in 3%
H2O2 to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity and 3% normal goat serum,
and then incubated overnight with antimouse NF-κB (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), TNF-α
(1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA),
TLR-4 (1:100, Abgent, a WuXi AppTec
company, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province,
China), and IL-1β (1:100, Abcam) rabbit
polyclonal antibodies in 0.01 mol/L PBS
overnight at 4°C. After a PBS wash, the
sections were incubated with secondary
antibody at 37°C for 30 min. Immunohistochemical staining was visualized by
use of a diaminobenzidine kit (Zhongshan Goldenbridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Meanwhile, five
visual fields of ischemic region from the
infarct area were selected and the immunoreactive cells were counted under a
400× light microscope. The average number was used for statistical analysis and
represented the NF-κB-, TNF-α-, TLR-4-,
and IL-1β-immunopositive cells (n = 5 in
each group).
Western Blotting
All proteins were obtained from the
cortex of the ischemic hemisphere using
a total protein extraction kit from Applygen Technologies Inc. (Beijing, China)
following the manufacturer’s protocols.
The protein concentrations of the extracts
were determined using a BCA Protein
Assay reagent kit (Novagen, Madison,
WI, USA), while 50 μg of proteins (n = 6
in each group) was separated by
SDS/PAGE electrophoresis and transferred to PVD membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat
milk in 0.01 mol/L PBS at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated overnight
at 4°C with the primary antibodies, including 1:1000 anti-TNF-α (Abcam,
ab9739), 1:500 anti-IL-1β (Abcam,
ab9787), 1:1000 anti- NF-κB p56 (Cell Signaling Technology, 3034), 1:1000 antiTLR-4 (CABGENT, AP96850), 1:1000

(Affinity, Cincinnati, OH, USA, AF1017)
and 1:1000 anti-p-NF-κB (Cell Signaling
Technology, 3039). Polyclonal rabbit antiβ-actin antibody (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich)
was used for internal control. After three
washes with TPBS, all membranes were
incubated with IRDye 800-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary
antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.
Signals were developed using Super Signal West Pico Chemi-luminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific [Thermo Fisher
Scientific]).
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase
Chain Reaction
Total RNA from ischemic region cortex
was extracted by TRIzol (Invitrogen
[Thermo Fisher Scientific]) and 1 μg of
RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using first-strand cDNA synthesis
kit (Invitrogen [Thermo Fisher Scientific]) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR of
mRNAs was performed using a Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG
Kit (Invitrogen [Thermo Fisher Scientific]). A GAPDH endogenous control
was used for normalization. All RT-PCR
experiments were run on a ABI 7700
FAST system, and the relative amount of
transcripts was calculated using the
2–ΔΔCt formula (n = 6 in each group). qRTPCR was used to analyze the levels of
TNF-α, IL-1β, TLR-4, NF-κB, SOCS1 and
MyD88 mRNA at 24 h after MCAO.

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) for
the quantification of miR-155 and primary transcript (pri)-miR-155 was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Applied Biosystems [Thermo

001806) and mmu-pri-miR-155 (assay ID:
Mm03306395) with RnU6b (assay ID:
001093) as a normalization control.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay
Tissue samples were taken from the
ischemic region of the brain (n = 6 in each
group). Protein levels of TNF-α and IL-1β
were quantified using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Ray
Biotech, Norcross, GA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. The absorbance was measured with a microplate
reader (Tecan SPECTRAFluor Plus, Tecan,
Grödig, Austria).
BV2 Culture and Treatment
The murine BV2 microglial cell line
was obtained from Xiehe Medical University (Beijing, China). The cells were
cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum,
100 μg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), and
2 mmol/L glutamine (Invitrogen
[Thermo Fisher Scientific]) at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5%
CO2. BV2 cells were pretreated by ABL
(100 μmol/L) for 24 h and then stimulated with different treatments.

Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation
BV2 cells were grown in complete
media supplemented with glucose
(4.5 g/mL) for 18 h in normoxic conditions (5% CO2 and 21% O2). To initiate
oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), BV2
cells were exposed to DMEM without
serum or glucose in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% nitrogen and 5%
CO2 at 37°C for 4 h in an incubator
(Serico CB, Binder GmBH, Tultingen,
Germany). Control cells were incubated
for 4 h in 5% CO2 and 21% O2 in a media
identical to the OGD media except for
the addition of glucose.

Statistical Analysis
All data were analyzed using proper
tools from SPSS 13.0 package, while all
quantitative data were expressed as
mean ± SD. Statistical comparisons were
conducted using one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) followed by SNK and
LSD tests for intergroup comparisons.
For neurological deficit, Mann-Whitney
U test was applied for comparisons between groups. Differences with P < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.

Cell Transfection
BV2 cells were transfected with indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen [Thermo Fisher Scientific]) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After transfection for 24 h, BV2 cells
were pretreated with ABL (100 μmol/L)
for 24 h and then exposed to OGD for 4 h.
1 μmol/L of the mature mimic miR-155
(Dharmacon Research Inc., Lafayette, CO,
USA), respectively, 2 μmol/L miR-155 inhibitor miRNA (Dharmacon) was transiently transfected into BV2 cells using
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen
[Thermo Fisher Scientific]) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Twenty hours
after transfection, the cells were treated
with ABL and OGD as mentioned above.

RESULTS

Reporter Gene Assays
miR-155 (BIC) promoter (–1500 ± 10 bp)
was constructed using PGL3 plasmids.
BV2 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate
and grown for 24 h before transfection
with indicated plasmids. Cells were
transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen [Thermo Fisher Scientific])
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then harvested and luciferase activities were measured using a
Dual Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). Specific promoter
activity was expressed as the relative activity ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla
luciferase. All promoter constructs were
evaluated in a minimum of three separate wells per experiment.

ABL Decreases Inflammatory
Responses Induced by Focal Cerebral
Ischemia
The protective effect of ABL on ischemic brain injury was evaluated by assessment of neurological deficit scores
and cerebral infarct volumes of MCAO
mice at 24 h after ischemia. The results
showed that ABL treatment dose dependently reduced ischemia-induced
neurological deficits and cerebral infarct
volumes as determined by neurological
testing (Figure 1B; *P < 0.05) and TTC
staining (Figure 1C; *P < 0.05). The ABLtreated group showed significantly reduced neurological deficits at a dose of
20 mg/kg of ABL and significantly decreased infarct volume at a dose of
10 mg/kg of ABL. To assess whether the
protective effect of ABL against cerebral
ischemic injury is related to its antiinflammatory properties, we examined
some cytokines closely related to the
proinflammatory response. Western blotting analysis showed a significant increase in TNF-α and IL-1β in ischemic
cerebral tissues 24 h after MCAO. ABL
treatment markedly suppressed ischemia-induced upregulation of TNF-α and
IL-1β in ischemic cerebral tissues, and
20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg of ABL were
more effective than 10 mg/kg of ABL
(Figure 1D), suggesting that ABL dosedependently inhibits inflammation induced by MCAO. Consistent with the

MOL MED 21:197-209, 2015 | WEN ET AL. | 201

ABL MODULATES MicroRNA-155-MEDIATED INFLAMMATION

inhibitory effect of ABL on protein expression, ABL also significantly inhibited
the mRNA expression of TNF-α and
IL-1β induced by MCAO, as assessed by
qRT-PCR (Figure 1E). The protein concentrations of TNF-α and IL-1β in brain
tissues 24 h after MCAO were measured
by ELISA, and the results showed a similar trend to those observed in the qRTPCR analysis (Figure 1F). In addition, the
antiinflammatory effect of ABL was further verified by immunohistochemical
staining for TNF-α and IL-1β, which
showed that upregulation of TNF-α and
IL-1β by MCAO also was suppressed
with the different doses of ABL, as
shown by the number of IL-1β- and
TNF-α-positive cells (Figure 1G left and
right).
Because microglia are the primary immune competent cells enriched in brain
tissue and because they respond rapidly
to brain insults by changing their morphology and cytokine production (25),
we sought to examine the effect of ABL
on the activation of BV2 microglial cells
after OGD. As shown in Figure 1H (left
and right), the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β
were increased after 4 h of OGD, and
100 μmol/L of ABL significantly reduced
the TNF-α and IL-1β levels in BV2 cells
under OGD for 4 h. This result is consistent with the inhibitory effect of ABL on
ischemia-induced inflammation in
MCAO mice.
ABL Decreases Inflammatory
Responses via Inhibiting the
TLR4/NF-κB Signaling Cascades
Because TLR4 mediates microglial inflammatory responses, which is important for microglial activation (26), we
sought to determine whether the TLR
signaling pathway mediates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in response to ischemic brain injury and
whether ABL inhibits cerebral ischemiainduced inflammation by blocking the
TLR signaling pathway. As shown in
Figures 2A and Figure 2B, the expression
levels of TLR4 and NF-κB were obviously increased after 24 h of MCAO, as
determined by Western blotting and the

MCAO provoked a significant decrease
in the expression of I-κB and TAB2 (see
Figure 2A). However, the protein levels
of MyD88 and SOCS1 were unchanged
after 24 h of MCAO. Compared to the
MCAO group, TLR4 and NF-κB expression were significantly decreased in the
three ABL-treated groups, and the inhibitory effect of 30 mg/kg of ABL on
TLR4 and NF-κB expression was more
significant than that of 10 mg/kg and
20 mg/kg of ABL (Figure 2A right). By
contrast, ABL dose-dependently increased the expression of I-κB, MyD88
and SOCS1; these protein expression levels were much higher in MCAO mice
treated with 30 mg/kg of ABL than
those in control mice. A similar result
was observed in OGD-treated BV2 cells
(Figure 2C), showing that ABL reduced
NF-κB and TLR4 levels significantly, but
increased levels of I-κB, MyD88 and
SOCS1. These results indicate that ABL
decreases inflammatory responses induced by MCAO and OGD by suppressing NF-κB and TLR4 expression and
promoting the expression of MyD88,
SOCS1 and I-κB, which are involved in
the TLR signaling pathway and negatively regulate inflammatory responses.

ABL Inhibits miR-155 Expression in
Ischemic Cerebral Tissue and BV2
Microglial Cells
miR-155 is an inflammation-related
miRNA and enhances proinflammatory
cytokine expression (13). To examine
whether miR-155 is required for cerebral
inflammatory responses induced by
MCAO and whether the inhibitory effect
of ABL on cerebral inflammatory responses is related to its regulation of
miR-155, we examined miR-155 expression in ischemic cerebral tissue of MCAO
mice and OGD-treated BV2 cells. The results showed miR-155 was upregulated
in ischemic cerebral tissues after 24 h of
MCAO. Importantly, ABL treatment
dose-dependently suppressed the expression of miR-155 induced by MCAO (Figure 3A). The results from MCAO mice
were verified further with OGD-treated
BV2 cells, which showed that the miR155 upregulation induced by OGD was
abolished by treating BV2 cells with
100 μmol/L of ABL (Figure 3B). In parallel with these results, measurements of
luciferase activity showed that OGD
treatment significantly increased the
transcriptional activity of the miR-155
promoter compared with OGD-untreated
BV2 cells (Figure 3C). These results indicate that miR-155 is implicated in the

cerebral inflammation induced by
MCAO, and that ABL has an inhibitory
effect on the miR-155 expression induced
by MCAO.
ABL Suppresses miR-155-Mediated
Inflammatory Responses in Ischemic
Cerebral Tissue and BV2 Microglial
Cells
Next, the role of miR-155 in ischemic
brain injury induced by MCAO was
evaluated by comparing the cerebral infarction volume of miR-155–/– and WT
mice. We found that knockout (KO) of
miR-155 obviously reduced the neurological deficit (see Figure 1B) and cerebral infarct volume (see Figure 1C) induced by MCAO, suggesting that
deletion of miR-155 protects against ischemic brain injury induced by MCAO.
Western blotting analysis showed that
the upregulation of TNF-α and IL-1β by
MCAO in the ischemic cerebral tissues
of miR-155–/– mice was reduced markedly compared with WT mice, and ABL
treatment further reduced TNF-α and
IL-1β expression in miR-155–/– mice (Figures 4A, B). A similar result was obtained by qRT-PCR, which showed that
knockout of miR-155 obviously reduced
the TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA levels after
MCAO surgery (Figure 4C). We then in-

(B) Band intensities in panel A that were normalized to β-actin are represented by bar graphs as the
means ± SD (n = 6 per group); *P < 0.05 versus WT + MCAO; #P < 0.05 versus miR-155KO + MCAO. (C) mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in
brain tissues of MCAO WT and miR-155–/– mice treated with or without ABL (20 mg/kg) were detected by qRT-PCR. Bars represent means ±

troduced pAd-miR-155 into WT mice
through an LV injection to overexpress
miR-155. We found miR-155 levels were
dramatically increased in the brain after
24 h of delivery of pAd-miR-155, and
miR-155 was widely expressed in the
whole mouse brain, especially in the cortex and hippocampus (Supplementary
Figure 1). Measurements of protein expression showed that miR-155 overexpression markedly increased the levels
of TNF-α and IL-1β in ischemic cerebral
tissue of MCAO mice, and that the upregulation of these two cytokines induced by miR-155 overexpression was
slightly reduced by ABL treatment relative to that of miR-155 overexpression
alone (Figures 4D, E). The qRT-PCR

results revealed significant parallel
alterations in the mRNA expression of
these genes (Figure 4F). Furthermore,
using cultured BV2 microglial cells, we
examined the effect of miR-155 overexpression or knockdown on the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β. The results
showed that overexpression of miR-155
significantly increased the levels of
TNF-α and IL-1β in OGD-treated BV2
cells (Figure 4G). Conversely, siRNAmediated knockdown of miR-155 was
accompanied by a marked reduction in
TNF-α and IL-1β compared with the
nonsilencing control siRNA, and ABL
treatment further decreased the expression levels of these two cytokines (Figure 4H). These results clearly suggest

204 | WEN ET AL. | MOL MED 21:197-209, 2015

that miR-155 mediates the expression
of TNF-α and IL-1β in ischemic cerebral
tissue.
ABL Prohibits miR-155-Mediated
Inflammatory Responses by
Regulating TLR4/MyD88 and SOCS1
Expression
Because we found that miR-155 regulated the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β
in ischemic cerebral tissue, and the increased expression of TNF-α and IL-1β
was decreased by ABL treatment via inhibition of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling
cascades, we sought to determine the
mechanism by which miR-155 and ABL
modulate the inflammatory responses induced by cerebral ischemia. As shown in

RESEARCH ARTICLE

Figure 5. ABL prohibits miR-155-mediated inflammatory responses through regulating the TLR4/MyD88 and SOCS1 expression. (A) Total
proteins were extracted from brain tissues of MCAO WT and miR-155–/– mice treated with or without ABL (20 mg/kg) and analyzed by
Western blotting for TLR4, MyD88 and SOCS1. (B) Band intensities in panel A that were normalized to β-actin are represented by bar
graphs as the means ± SD (n = 6 per group); *P < 0.05 versus WT + MCAO. (C) mRNA levels of TLR4, MyD88 and SOCS1 in brain tissues of

per group); *P < 0.05 versus WT + MCAO; #P < 0.05 versus miR-155KO + MCAO. (D) WT mice were infected with pAd or pAd-miR-155

(F) mRNA levels of TLR4, MyD88 and SOCS1 in brain tissues of pAd- or pAd-miR155-infected MCAO mice treated with or without ABL (20 mg/kg) were detected by qRT-PCR. Bars represent means ± SD (n = 6 per
group); *P < 0.05 versus pAd + MCAO; #P < 0.05 versus pAd-miR-155 + MCAO. (G) BV2 cells were infected with pAd-miR-155 or si-miR155, and then treated with or without ABL (100 μmol/L) for 24 h prior to OGD. TLR4, MyD88 and SOCS1 were detected by Western blotting. (H) Band intensities in panel G that were normalized to β-actin are represented by bar graphs as the means ± SD from three independent experiments; *P < 0.05 versus pAd + OGD; #P < 0.05 versus si-Con + OGD; **P < 0.05 versus pAd-miR155 + OGD; ##P < 0.05
versus si-miR155 + OGD.

Figure 5A, marked expression of TLR4
was observed in ischemic cerebral tissue
of WT mice at 24 h after MCAO, and this
expression was obviously reduced in
miR-155–/– mice (Figure 5B, group 3 versus group 1), suggesting that deletion of
miR-155 protects against TLR4 upregulation induced by MCAO. TLR4 expression
was not further decreased in miR-155–/–
mice regardless of ABL treatment (Figure 5B, group 4 versus group 3), most
likely due to the deletion of miR-155. As
expected, the expression levels of MyD88
and SOCS1, negative regulators of TLRtriggered inflammatory responses, were
upregulated by ABL in WT mice after
MCAO (Figure 5B). MyD88 and SOCS1

expression levels were further increased
in ischemic cerebral tissue of miR-155–/–
mice regardless of ABL treatment (see
Figure 5B). The effect of miR-155 deletion
on TLR4, MyD88 and SOCS1 expression
was further verified by qRT-PCR of the
mRNA expression of these genes (Figure 5C). To further determine whether
the expression of MyD88 and SOCS1 is
regulated by miR-155 and ABL, miR-155
was overexpressed in WT mice by injecting pAd-miR-155 into the LV. The results
showed that TLR4 expression was significantly increased in ischemic cerebral tissue of miR-155-overexpressing mice
compared with pAd-infected mice (Figure 5E, group 3 versus group 1), and ABL

treatment reduced TLR4 expression regardless of whether miR-155 was overexpressed (Figure 5E, group 2 versus
group 1; group 4 versus group 3). Accordingly, miR-155 overexpression was
reduced, while ABL treatment increased
the expression of MyD88 and SOCS1
(Figure 5E). In support of this finding,
we also showed significant parallel alterations in the mRNA expression of these
genes by qRT-PCR (Figure 5F). In keeping
with the in vivo data, miR-155 overexpression and knockdown in OGD-treated
BV2 cells, promoted and inhibited TLR4
expression, but inhibited and promoted
MyD88 and SOCS1 expression (Figure 5G).

band intensities that were normalized to β-actin are represented by bar graphs as the
means ± SD (n = 6 per group); *P < 0.05 versus pAd + MCAO; #P < 0.05 versus WT + MCAO.

from three independent experiments; *P < 0.05 versus con group.

TLR4, MyD88 and SOCS1 in OGD-treated
BV2 cells, where miR-155 was overexpressed or knocked down, were similar
to those observed in miR-155–/– mice and
miR-155-overexpressing mice after
MCAO (Figure 5H). These results suggest that miR-155 mediates inflammatory

responses by regulating TLR4/MyD88
and SOCS1 expression.
ABL Does Not Act Directly on
Proinflammatory Signaling
Because it is known that many signaling proteins, including p38 MAPK, JNK

206 | WEN ET AL. | MOL MED 21:197-209, 2015

and PI3K/Akt, are important downstream effector molecules that participate
in the MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling
cascades that can lead to NF-κB activation (27,28), we sought to examine
whether miR-155 and ABL might also affect the activation of these signaling molecules. The results shown in Figure 6A
demonstrate an obvious increase in the
levels of p-Akt, p-ERK, p-JNK and
p-NF-κB in ischemic cerebral tissue of
miR-155-overexpressing mice after
MCAO compared with pAd-infected
mice (see Figure 6A). Conversely, miR155 knockout abrogated the activation effect of cerebral ischemia on these signaling molecules (see Figure 6A), indicating
that miR-155 is involved in cerebral ischemia-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt, ERK, JNK and NF-κB.
However, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK
was not affected by miR-155 overexpression or knockout under brain ischemic
conditions induced by MCAO. Interestingly, deletion of miR-155 markedly suppressed NF-κB acetylation, but the acetylation of NF-κB was not significantly
affected by miR-155 overexpression (see
Figure 6A). Next, we used the cultured
BV2 microglial cells to assess the effect of
ABL on the OGD-induced phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, JNK and p38. The results showed that ABL treatment did not
obviously affect the phosphorylation of
Akt, ERK, JNK and p38, or NF-κB acetylation induced by OGD (Figure 6B).
These findings suggest that ABL exerts
its inhibitory action on the activation of
proinflammatory signaling cascades by
suppressing miR-155 expression, but it
does not act directly on proinflammatory
signaling molecules.
DISCUSSION
Our findings in this study are as follows: (1) ABL dose-dependently inhibits
TNF-α and IL-1β expression in ischemic
cerebral tissue of MCAO mice and OGDtreated BV2 cells. (2) ABL decreases inflammatory cytokine production by suppressing the expression of the
proinflammatory signaling molecules
NF-κB and TLR4. (3) miR-155 mediates

RESEARCH ARTICLE

TNF-α and IL-1β expression in the ischemic cerebral tissue of MCAO mice and
OGD-treated BV2 cells, and ABL has an
inhibitory effect on miR-155 expression.
(4) miR-155 promotes TNF-α and IL-1β
expression by upregulating TLR4 expression and downregulating SOCS1 and
MyD88 expression, and ABL blocks the
actions of miR-155. (5) ABL inhibits
proinflammatory signaling cascades by
suppressing miR-155 expression, but it
does not act directly on proinflammatory
signaling molecules.
In inflammation after cerebral ischemia, proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β,
IL-6 and TNF-α are released by necrotic
and injured tissue. Inflammatory response occurs through the action of these
cytokines (29,30). In the present study,
we demonstrated that the mRNA expression levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in ischemic cerebral tissue of MCAO mice were
significantly increased 24 h after MCAO
compared with those in control mice,
which is consistent with a previous observation that expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β
and TNF-α, is elevated significantly in
EDA+/+ mice after cerebral ischemia (31).
Because previous studies have identified
microglia as the major cellular mediator
of injury (32,33) and the main source of
IL-1β (34), we also tested the effect of
OGD on the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in BV2 microglia cells. As
expected, we found that the expressions
of TNF-α and IL-1β in OGD-treated BV2
cells were similar to those seen in ischemic cerebral tissue. Importantly, ABL
treatment significantly suppressed the ischemia-induced upregulation of TNF-α
and IL-1β. Meanwhile, the cerebral infarction volume also was reduced after
ABL treatment, indicating that ABL can
efficiently reduce brain injury in a focal
cerebral ischemia injury model by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine expression and that the antiinflammation
action of ABL in ischemic cerebral tissue
is related to its inhibitory effect on microglia-mediated inflammation (31).
We next investigated how ischemia induces the production of proinflamma-

tory cytokines. Because TLRs are known
to recognize host-derived molecules released from injured tissues and cells (35)
and to initiate the production of proinflammatory cytokines through the activation of NF-κB (36–38), we first examined
the effect of ischemia on signaling transduction molecules that participate in the
MyD88-dependent TLR4 signaling cascades. We showed that cerebral ischemia
enhanced TLR4 and NF-κB, but not
MyD88 and SOCS-1. Previous studies
have demonstrated that MyD88 negatively regulates the inflammatory responses triggered by LPS and is essential
for the induction of the inflammatory cytokines triggered by all TLRs (8). SOCS-1,
a negative regulator of the cytokine signaling cascade, inhibits LPS-induced
NF-κB and STAT1 activation in macrophages presumably by binding to IRAK
(39). The above findings indicate that
TLR4 and NF-κB play an important role
in mediating the inflammatory response
to cerebral ischemia, whereas ischemia
do not significantly affect the expression
of negative regulators of inflammation,
MyD88 and SOCS1. Furthermore, to
identify potential targets of ABL action,
we determined the effects of ABL on the
TLR-triggered proinflammatory signaling cascades. We found that ABL markedly inhibited the NF-κB and TLR4 expression induced by MCAO and OGD
and increased the expression of MyD88,
SOCS1 and I-κB. This is consistent with
previous findings that ABL could suppress NF-κB activation and block the
binding of active NF-κB to the target
gene promoters (19–21). Our results suggest that ABL exerts its inhibitory effect
on the ischemia-induced inflammation
via abrogating the ischemia-induced upregulation of NF-κB and TLR4 and inducing the expression of MyD88, SOCS1
and I-κB.
Following focal cerebral ischemia,
significant changes in the miRNA transcriptome were observed (40), indicating
that miRNAs could play a pivotal role in
regulating the complex cascade of molecular signaling associated with cerebral
ischemia–mediated inflammation. A pre-

vious study has demonstrated that miR15a contributes to the pathogenesis of ischemic vascular injury through direct inhibition of the antiapoptotic gene bcl-2
(41). Gain or loss of miR-15a significantly
reduced or increased oxygen-glucose
deprivation-induced cerebral vascular
endothelial cell death, respectively. Another recent study showed that miR-497
was induced in mouse brain transient
MCAO, and in vivo repression of miR497 using antagomirs could effectively
reduce MCAO-induced infarcts and improve brain damage with a corresponding increase in bcl-2 protein (42). In the
present study, we first demonstrated that
miR-155 expression was upregulated 25fold in ischemic cerebral tissues of
MCAO mice compared with control
mice, and a similar result was obtained
in OGD-treated BV2 cells. These findings
suggest that overexpression of miR-155 is
responsible for postischemic inflammation induced by MCAO. Because miR155 is known to enhance proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages
by targeting several mediators of inflammatory signaling, such as SHIP1, SOCS1,
SMAD2 and TAB2 (16,17), we determined which signaling transduction molecule in the TLR-triggered proinflammatory signaling cascades was targeted by
miR-155. Our data showed that the expression of TLR4 was significantly decreased in ischemic cerebral tissue of
miR-155–/– mice after MCAO, whereas enforced overexpression of miR-155 obviously increased TLR4 expression in ischemic cerebral tissue. Like the in vivo
data, miR-155 overexpression and knockdown in OGD-treated BV2 cells, respectively, promoted and inhibited TLR4 expression, but inhibited and promoted
SOCS1 and MyD88 expression. These
data clearly indicate that SOCS1 and
MyD88 may be important targets of
miR-155, whereas TLR4 expression also
appears to be indirectly regulated by
miR-155. To further examine whether the
inhibitory effect of ABL on ischemia-induced inflammation is related to its regulation of miR-155 expression, we determined the effect of miR-155 gain or loss

MOL MED 21:197-209, 2015 | WEN ET AL. | 207

ABL MODULATES MicroRNA-155-MEDIATED INFLAMMATION

on TNF-α and IL-1β expression, as well
as whether ABL affected the expression
of miR-155. As expected, overexpression
or knockout of miR-155 significantly increased or reduced the expression of
TNF-α, IL-1β and NF-κB in ischemic
cerebral tissue or OGD-treated BV2 cells,
respectively. Importantly, ABL treatment
markedly suppressed the expression of
miR-155 in ischemic cerebral tissues of
MCAO mice and OGD-treated BV2 cells,
indicating that miR-155 mediates ischemia-induced inflammation through regulating the TLR4/MyD88 and SOCS1 expression, and that ABL blocks
proinflammatory signaling cascades by
suppressing miR-155 expression.
Because ERK, JNK, p38 and Akt signalings could participate in the TLR-triggered proinflammatory signaling cascades induced by cerebral ischemia, we
examined the role of these signaling cascades in the TLR-triggered proinflammation by measuring their phosphorylation
levels (28). Our results showed that ABL
did not affect the phosphorylation level
of ERK, JNK, p38 and Akt, suggesting
that ABL modulates the expression of
proinflammatory signaling molecules by
suppressing miR-155 expression but does
not act directly on the proinflammatory
signaling molecules ERK, JNK, p38 and
Akt.
Although the present study provides
some novel insights into the protective
action of ABL in focal cerebral ischemiainduced inflammatory responses, a
major limitation of the present study is
the lack of characterization of the targets
of miR-155 in the context of ABL treatment, which has been included in the
continuing efforts of our next project. Altogether, our results suggest that miR155 might represent a potential therapeutic target of ABL in the prevention and
treatment of inflammatory brain damage
after cerebral ischemia.
CONCLUSION
Our current study indicates that miR155 mediates inflammatory responses in
the ischemic cerebral tissue by modulating TLR4/MyD88 and SOCS1 expres-

sion and that ABL exerts its antiinflammatory action by suppressing miR-155
expression, suggesting a novel miR-155based intervention strategy for ischemic
stroke.
