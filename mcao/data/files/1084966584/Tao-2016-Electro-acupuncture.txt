Reactive astrogliosis is a common phenomenon in central nervous system (CNS) injuries such as ischemic
stroke. The present study aimed to deeply investigate the relationships between the neuroprotective
effect of electro-acupuncture (EA) and reactive astrocytes following cerebral ischemia. EA treatment at
the Quchi (LI11) and Zusanli (ST36) acupoints at Day 3 attenuated neurological deﬁcits and cerebral infarct
volume in ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injured rats. Animal behavior assessments found that the speed
of Catwalk gait, equilibrium and coordination of Rotarod test were improved. Furthermore, EA treatment
exerted neuroprotective effects via activation of glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin and nestin
positive cells. Simultaneously, an obvious increase in GFAP/vimentin, GFAP/nestin and GFAP/BrdU colabeling appeared in the peri-infract cortex and striatum, suggesting EA can promote the proliferation of
GFAP/vimentin/nestin-positive reactive astrocytes. The expression of cell cycle-associated proteins Cyclin
Dl, CDK4 and phospho-Rb were increased in the peri-infract cortex and striatum, indicating proliferated
reactive astrocytes-mediated CyclinDl/CDK4 regulation of the transition of the G1-to-S cell cycle phases.
In addition, EA enhanced the localized expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the
peri-infract cortex and striatum. These results demonstrated that EA treatment at the LI11 and ST36
acupoints on Day 3 exerted neuroprotection via proliferation of GFAP/vimentin/nestin-positive reactive
astrocytes and, potentially, secretion of reactive astrocytes-derived BDNF in I/R injured rats.

including stroke (Robel et al., 2011; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010).
Reactive astrocytes exhibit temporal morphological changes such
as hyperplasia and hypertrophy, aggregation and tangles after cerebral ischemic stroke, which eventually contributes to a physical
barrier at the interface of the lesion and the surrounding tissue (Hol
and Pekny, 2015). The processes involved in astrocytes activation
depend, in part, on the upregulation of cytoskeletal components,
intermediate ﬁlaments proteins (IFs), which are composed of type
III (vimentin and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and type IV
proteins (nestin) (Jing et al., 2007; Pekny et al., 2007; Pekny et al.,
2014; Ståhlberg et al., 2011). GFAP is a commonly used marker
for protoplasmic astrocytes and vimentin is expressed in radial
neuroglia cells and neural and glial precursors (Clark et al., 2003).
Nestin is a well known marker of neural stem cell (NSCs) and
neural progenitor cells (Shimada et al., 2010; White et al., 2010).
However, GFAP, vimentin and nestin are also expressed in a subpopulation of reactive astrocytes after stroke (Pekny and Nilsson,
2005; Sofroniew, 2009). Evidence suggests GFAP/vimentin-positive

reactive astrocytes generate beneﬁcial effects for axonal remodeling and motor behavioral recovery in GFAP−/−/vimentin−/− mice
after stroke (Liu et al., 2014). Reactive astrocytes may be involved
in protecting surrounding healthy brain tissue from exposure to
cellular debris and cytotoxic elements in the infarct area, or by
effective elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutamate to counter edema that develops in brain ischemia (De Pablo
et al., 2013; Li et al., 2008; Hamby and Sofroniew, 2010; Roy
Choudhury et al., 2014). In addition, reactive astrocytes exert neuroprotective effects via secretion of neurotrophic factors including
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) (Béjot
et al., 2011; Ishizaka et al., 2013; Mizuta et al., 2001). Therefore,
reactive astrocytes have emerged as potential therapeutic targets
for the treatment of stroke. For example, furin and puerarin facilitate the activation of astrocytes to release BDNF, which protects
against hypoxic or ischemic damage (Chen et al., 2015; Wang et al.,
2014).
Electro-acupuncture (EA), engrafted electric stimulation to acupoints through acupuncture needles, is accepted as a common
complementary therapy for stroke in both Asian and Western countries (Romita et al., 1997; Tsui and Leung, 2002). Experimental
studies have shown that EA treatment can increase the number
of GFAP or nestin positive cells, as well as the expression of BDNF
in cerebral ischemia (Kim et al., 2013, 2014b; Yu et al., 2010).
Our previous research has also demonstrated that EA treatment
at the LI11 and ST36 acupoints can stimulate nerve-cell proliferation in a rat model of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R)
injury (Tao et al., 2014,2010). However, the effects of EA treatment
on GFAP/vimentin/nestin-positive reactive astrocytes and spatiotemporal change of reactive astrocytes-derived BDNF in cerebral
ischemia remain unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed
to elucidate potential relationships between the neuroprotective
effect of EA treatment and reactive astrocytes in a rat model of
cerebral I/R injury.

surgerical process, CBF reduction to equal or greater than 80% was
considered to be sufﬁcient ischemic insult. Rat body temperature
was maintained at 37 ◦ C during surgery and until rats recovered
from anesthesia. According to a generated random number table,
forty-eight male SD rats were divided randomly into three groups
(n = 16 each) as follows: Sham operation group (Sham), MCAO
group (MCAO), and EA treatment + MCAO group (MCAO + EA). Sham
group animals were subjected to sham operation and treated similarly, but without ligations and intraluminal occlusive embolus
placement.
2.3. EA treatment
The MCAO + EA group was prepared and subjected to a 30 min
stimulation with a dense disperse wave of 1 or 20-Hz (adjusted to
the muscle twitch threshold) by using an EA stimulator instrument
(Model G6805; SMIF, Shanghai, China). Rats in the MCAO + EA group
were treated by EA on the right paralyzed limb at Zusanli (ST 36,
located on approximately 5 mm lateral to the anterior tubercle of
the tibia and the upper 1/6 of the length of the lower leg below the
knee) and Quchi (LI 11, located at the midpoint between the lateral
end of the transverse cubical crease and the lateral epicondyle of
the humerus of the upper limb). Two stainless steel acupuncture
needles (diameter of 0.3 mm) were inserted at a depth of 2–3 mm
into the above-mentioned acupuncture points. The treatment was
started at 24 h after MCAO operation and continued until animals
were sacriﬁced at Day 3 after EA treatment.
2.4. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling
BrdU (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) is a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analog that becomes incorporated into the cell’s DNA during
S-phase of the cell division cycle. For labeling proliferating cells, all
animals received daily intraperitoneal BrdU (50 mg/kg) injections,
twice a day, at an eight-hour interval, for 3 successive days during
EA treatment (Sugiura et al., 2005). Twenty-four hours after the last
injection, the animals were sacriﬁced.

2.1. Animals and ethics
2.5. Neurological test score assessment
All experiments were performed in strict accordance with International Ethical Guidelines and the National Institutes of Health
Guide concerning the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were
approved by the Ethics Committee of Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, China. Adult male Sprague–Dawley (SD)
rats weighing 240–280 g, provided by Shanghai SLAC Laboratory
Animal Co., Ltd., (license number: SCXK [Shanghai, China] 20130005) were used in the experiments in this study. The animals
were fed regular chow and had free access to food and water and
were maintained in an animal facility with regulated temperature,
humidity, and a twelve-hour light cycle.

Neurological function was assessed in each rat at 2 h after I/R and
at Days 1 and 3 after EA treatment by using a previously described
single-blind method (Longa et al., 1989; Xue et al., 2014). The neurological score of each rat was graded using a numeric scale from 0
to 4: score 0 indicates no apparent deﬁcits, score 1 indicates mild
deﬁcits (failure to extend the right forepaw), score 2 (circling to
the right) and score 3 (falling to the right) represent moderate
deﬁcits, score 4 (loss of walking) represents severe deﬁcits. MCAO
rats with neurological deﬁcit scores of 0 or 4 were excluded from
our experiments.

2.2. Middle cerebral artery occlusion and animal grouping

2.6. Measurement of infarct volume

Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery
occlusion(MCAO) as previously described (Longa et al., 1989; Tao
et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, after anesthetization by intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg body weight), the left middle
cerebral artery was occluded by placement of an embolus. Reperfusion was achieved by slowly removing the intraluminal occlusive
embolus to restore blood supply after 120 min. In MCAO animals,
regional cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) was measured using a Laser
Doppler Flowmetry system (BIOPAC Systems, Goleta, CA, USA)
attached to the surface of the skull over the ipsilateral cortex to conﬁrm consistent and similar levels of ischemic induction. During the

The rats were euthanized by cervical dislocation under ether
anesthesia. The brain was rapidly removed, dissected and cut
into 2-mm-thick coronal slices using a rodent brain matrix at the
3rd day after EA treatment. The fresh slices were immediately
immersed in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) as previously described (Lan et al., 2013). The
TTC-stained slices were photographed by a high-resolution digital
camera (Canon SX20 IS, Japan), and the infarct area was determined
using a computerized image analysis software (Motic Med 6.0 System). The data were expressed as the percentage of infarct volume
to the total brain area.

2.7. Animal behavioral tests
All rats were familiarized with training in behavioral assessments and performed at least three days prior to the start of the
experiment. Formal testing was conducted before MCAO operation and at Day 3 after EA treatment by observers blinded to the
experimental groups. For the Rotarod test, the training protocol was
based on previous research (Chen et al., 2010). In brief, rats were
placed on a Rotarod cylinder (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy), and the
speed was slowly increased from 4 to 40 rpm within ﬁve minutes.
Three repeated trials were performed in one-minute time intervals.
Test data are presented as the average of the three recorded times
that an animal was able to remain on the Rotarod compared with
the internal baseline control (before MCAO operation).
The Catwalk XT system (Noldus Information Technology,
Wageningen, The Netherlands) is a relatively new approach
for quantitative analysis of gait following experimental stroke
(Encarnacion et al., 2011; Parkkinen et al., 2013). On testing days,
animals were given a re-run if the rat failed to complete a run within
10 s or walked backwards during the run. The rats were subjected
to three consecutive complete runs across the walkway. Test data
are presented as the average of the three recorded times of successful runs across the walkway. Additionally, if an animal was unable
to complete runs due to serious injury and deﬁcits, it was excluded
from the study of gait analysis.
2.8. Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence staining
The brain tissues were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in parafﬁn, then sectioned into 6-␮m thick coronal slices. For
immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, the slices were incubated
overnight at 4 ◦ C with the primary antibodies rabbit anti-GFAP
(dilution of 1:800, #12389, Cell Signaling Technology, USA);
mouse anti-vimentin (dilution of 1:500, ab8978, Abcam, UK) and
mouse anti-nestin (dilution of 1:600, ab6142, Abcam, UK) and
then incubated with corresponding biotinylated secondary antibodies followed by avidin–biotin–peroxidase treatment, and the
immunoreactivity was visualized with 0.05% diaminobenzidine
(DAB Kit-0017, Maixin, China) at room temperature. Hematoxylin
staining was used as a counterstain to visualize cell nuclei.
Images were captured using an upright metallurgical microscope
(DM4000LED, Leica, Germany) at 200× magniﬁcation.
For immunoﬂuorescence (IF) staining, the slices were incubated
overnight at 4◦ C with the primary antibodies rat anti-BrdU (dilution of 1:400, ab6326, Abcam, UK), rabbit anti-GFAP (dilution of
1:300, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), mouse anti-vimentin (dilution of 1:200, ab8978, Abcam, UK) and mouse anti-nestin (dilution
of 1:200, ab6142, Abcam, UK), and then incubated with secondary
antibodies conjugated to ﬂuorophores Alexa Fluor 488 (donkey
anti-rat, dilution of 1:200, A21208, Life Technologies, USA), Alexa
Fluor 488 (donkey anti-rabbit, dilution of 1:200, A21441, Life Technologies, USA), Alexa Fluor 488 (donkey anti-mouse, dilution of
1:200, A21202, Life Technologies, USA), Alexa Fluor 546 (donkey
anti-mouse, dilution of 1:200, A10036, Life Technologies, USA) and
Alexa Fluor 546 (donkey anti-rabbit, dilution of 1:200, A10040,
Santa Cruz, USA) for 2 h at room temperature in the dark, respectively. Nuclei of all cells were counterstained with DAPI (dilution
of 1:1000; Santa Cruz, USA). The tissue slides were mounted in

mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, USA) and images were
captured using a confocal ﬂuorescence microscope (LSM710, Carl
Zeiss, Germany). The average number of double-labeled positive
cells from three slices for each rat with four ﬁelds of view/slice was
used for statistical analysis.
2.9. Western blotting
The lesion boundary region of the ischemic hemisphere was
collected and homogenized in Radio Immunoprecipitation Assay
(RIPA) buffer. The protein concentration was determined using the
bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, USA) and a
total of 50 ␮g protein was separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide
gels and then electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). The membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5% nonfat
milk at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C with
the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-CDK4 (dilution of
1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), rabbit anti-p-Rb (dilution
of 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), rabbit anti-Cyclin D1
(dilution of 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), rabbit anti-␤actin (dilution of 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) and rabbit
anti-BDNF (dilution of 1:2000, Abcam, UK). After three washes,
blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
(dilution of 1:5000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) for 1 h. The
immunoreactive protein bands were developed using enhanced
chemiluminescence and quantiﬁed using a Bio-Image Analysis System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The optical density was calculated
and the expression of proteins were presented as the densitometric
ratio of protein bands to ␤-actin.
2.10. Statistical analysis
All data were presented as mean ± S.E.M and were analyzed
using the SPSS software package (version 16.0). Statistical analysis of the data was performed with the unpaired Student’s t-test,
the Mann–Whitney U test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
when comparing more than two groups. A P < 0.05 was considered
as statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Effects of EA treatment on neurological deﬁcits and cerebral
infarct volumes
EA treatment-mediated neuroprotection in MCAO rats was evaluated by assessing neurological deﬁcit scores and cerebral infarct
volumes. Rats developed neurological deﬁcits and received EA
treatment beginning Day 1 following reperfusion. The neurological
deﬁcit scores increased in both the MCAO and MCAO + EA groups,
although no differences in neurological deﬁcit scores between the
two groups at 2 h after I/R (P > 0.05) were observed, which indicated
successful model establishment (Table 1). However, neurological
deﬁcits and cerebral infarct volumes were signiﬁcantly reduced
in the MCAO + EA group compared to the MCAO group at Day 3
after EA treatment (P < 0.05) (Table 1, Fig. 1A,B). These results suggested that EA treatment could attenuate neurological deﬁcits and
cerebral infarct.

3.2. Effects of EA treatment on animal behaviors
To determine whether EA treatment could improve motor function recovery in I/R injured rats, gait analysis and Rotarod tests
were used to evaluate motor dysfunction. The average speed of
Catwalk and percentage of mean duration (3 trials) on the Rotarod
were declined in both MCAO and MCAO + EA groups compared to
Sham animals (P < 0.05), whereas the duration of time spent on
the Catwalk were increased in the two groups (P < 0.05) (Fig.2A–C).
However, the average speed of Catwalk and percentage of mean
duration (3 trials) on the Rotarod in the MCAO + EA group was
increased compared to the MCAO group (P < 0.05), whereas the
duration of time on the Catwalk was decreased in the MCAO + EA
group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2A–C). These results suggested that EA treatment at Day 3 could improve motor function recovery of I/R injured
rats.
3.3. Effects of EA treatment on double-immunopositive
GFAP/Vimentin and GFAP/Nestin in peri-infarct cortex and
striatum
To investigate the inﬂuence of EA treatment on reactive astrocytes, double-immunopositive GFAP/vimentin and GFAP/nestin
were assessed in sections of rat brain tissue. A great number
of vimentin and nestin positive cells were observed in the periinfarct regions in the MCAO group and the MCAO + EA group (data
shown from the peri-infarct cortex and striatum, Figs. 3 A and
4 A), whereas minimal vimentin and nestin positive cells were
observed in the Sham group (data not shown). GFAP positive cells
were located in both damaged and intact brain regions in both the
MCAO and MCAO + EA groups, and morphological and molecular
features prominent in these cells were hypertrophy, aggregation
and tangles (data shown from the peri-infarct cortex and striatum, Fig. 5A), as a hallmark of astrocyte activation. The number
of double-immunopositive GFAP/vimentin and GFAP/nestin cells
were signiﬁcantly increased in the peri-infarct cortex and striatum in the MCAO + EA group compared to the MCAO group (P
< 0.05) (Figs. 3B, C and 4B, C). These results suggested that EA
treatment at Day 3 could markedly increase a subpopulation
of GFAP/vimentin/nestin-positive reactive astrocytes in the periinfarct cortex and striatum in rats that underwent I/R brain injury.

3.4. Effects of EA treatment on the co-expression of GFAP and
BrdU in peri-infarct cortex and striatum
To further determine the proliferation of reactive astrocytes, the
co-expression of GFAP/BrdU, a marker of cellular proliferation, was
analyzed by double-immunoﬂuorescence in the peri-infarct cortex
and striatum. Our results show that the co-expression of GFAP and
BrdU was signiﬁcantly increased in cells of the MCAO + EA group
compared to the MCAO group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 5B, C), suggesting EA
treatment at Day 3 could promote reactive astrocyte proliferation.

3.5. EA treatment effects on cell cycle-associated proteins in
peri-infarct cortex and striatum
Next, to identify possible mechanisms of reactive astrocyte proliferation in the peri-infarct cortex and striatum, the levels of cell
cycle-associated proteins Cyclin D1, CDK4, and phospho-Rb were
detected using Western blotting analysis. The results showed that
in both the MCAO and MCAO + EA groups, Cyclin D1, CDK4, p-Rb
protein expression in the peri-infarct cortex and striatum were
signiﬁcantly up-regulated compared to the Sham group (P < 0.05)
(Fig. 6A,B). However, the expression of Cyclin D1, CDK4 and p-Rb
were further enhanced in MCAO + EA group compared to MCAO
group (P < 0.05) (Fig. 6A,B), suggesting EA treatment at Day 3 signiﬁcantly increased expression of cell cycle-associated proteins in
the peri-infarct cortex and striatum.

3.6. Effects of EA treatment on the expression of BDNF in
peri-infarct cortex and striatum
To investigate whether BDNF is potentially released from
reactive astrocytes in peri-infarct brain tissue, the location and
expression of BDNF was analyzed using immunohistochemistry
and Western blot. Our results indicated that BDNF positive cells
were located in both damaged and intact brain regions of both the
MCAO and MCAO + EA groups (data shown from the peri-infarct
cortex and striatum, Fig. 7A). Western blotting revealed that BDNF
expression was signiﬁcantly increased in the peri-infarct cortex and
striatum in the MCAO + EA group compared to the MCAO group
(P < 0.05, Fig. 7B,C), suggesting EA treatment at Day 3 might pro-

4. Discussion
Stroke, considered a severe cerebrovascular disease, is the second leading cause of death and a major cause of disability in
adults (Donnan et al., 2008). Acupuncture is a form of alternative
medicine and a key component of traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM) involving the insertion of thin needles into the body at speciﬁc acupuncture points, or acupoints (Liu et al., 2013; Rabinstein
and Shulman, 2003). Electroacupunture (EA) treatment, as one
form of acupuncture, delivers electrical stimulation to acupoints
through acupuncture needles, has been particularly recommended
for treatment of pain relief and stroke recovery in both Asian and
Western countries (Berman et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012). It has
been documented that EA treatment may exert neuroprotective
effects through reduction in cellular apoptosis (Feng et al., 2013)
and excitatory amino acids (Zhang et al., 2007), and promotion
of elevated endogenous neurogenesis (Kim et al., 2014b). In the
present study, EA treatment at the LI11 and ST36 acupoints was
applied for 3 consecutive days in MCAO rats, which effectively
reduced cerebral infarct volumes and neurological deﬁcits as well
as improved motor function in speed, equilibrium and coordination
as determined through Catwalk gait and Rotarod analyses.
To identify the possible mechanisms of effect of EA treatment
at LI11 and ST36 acupoints, reactive astrocytes were observed in
peri-infarct brain region following cerebral ischemic stroke. GFAP
and vimentin are absent in reactive astrocytes in GFAP−/− and

Vimentin−/− mice (Eliasson et al., 1999). The over-expression of
GFAP and vimentin, which can polymerize with nestin, occurs following cerebral injury (Pekny et al., 2007). In the present study,
GFAP positive cells were increased in both damaged and undamaged brain regions after I/R injury, and cellular morphological and
molecular characteristics of these cells were hypertrophy, aggregation and tangled processes. Simultaneously, the GFAP/vimentin,
GFAP/nestin and GFAP/BrdU double positive cells persisted in the
surrounding cerebral infarct region, suggesting proliferation of
GFAP/vimentin/nestin-positive reactive astrocytes, which is consistent with previous reports (Abrahams et al., 2009; Shen et al.,
2010). However, EA treatment at the LI11 and ST36 acupints at
Day 3 further increased the number of double-immunopositive
GFAP/BrdU, GFAP/vimentin and GFAP/nestin in the peri-infarct cortex and striatum in MCAO rats. These results demonstrated that EA
treatment could promote proliferation of peri-infract cortex and
striatum-associated GFAP/vimentin/nestin-positive reactive astrocytes. Similarly, EA treatment at the Baihui (GV20) and Dazhui
(GV14) acupoints increased the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes in the surrounding cerebral infarcts (Han et al., 2010), which
suggests this may be a more widespread response to EA in the
ischemic brain.
Cell proliferation is related to cell cycle progression that is precisely regulated by three types of factors, CDKs, Cyclins and CKIs.
It has been shown that Cyclin D1 is the ﬁrst of these synthesized
when cells are driven into the cell cycle, synthesized during G1
metaphase and later phases, and enters its peak, binding to CDK4 to
form the Cyclin D1/CDK4 complex (Kim et al., 2014a). This complex
phosphorylates nuclear phosphoproteins including retinoblastoma

at the LI11 and ST36 acupoints increased BrdU labeling and the
levels of CyclinDl, CDK4 and p-Rb in the peri-infract cortex and
striatum. Therefore, these results suggest EA treatment could pro-

tion following cerebral ischemia. Studies have demonstrated that
astrocytes become reactive and release BDNF to protect neurons during hypoxia in the CNS (Chen et al., 2015; Ishitsuka
et al., 2012). Accumulating evidence indicates that endogenous
BDNF regulates neurogenesis and functional neurological recovery,
which positively correlate with synaptic plasticity, axon growth

and behavioral change after cerebral ischemia reperfusion (Cui
et al., 2010; Ke et al., 2011; Schäbitz et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011).
Astrocyte-derived BDNF and GDNF are major contributors to the
regulation of midbrain microglial activation and inhibition of neuroinﬂammation (Rocha et al., 2012). The present study found that
EA at the LI11 and ST36 acupoints enhanced the secretion of BDNF

in peri-infarct cortex and striatum. Studies have shown that EA
treatment can increase BDNF levels to exert neuroprotective effects
against caspase-3-dependent neuronal apoptosis in MCAO rats
(Chen et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2014). These results indicate that
EA treatment after ischemic stroke can promote the proliferation

of reactive astrocytes via enhancement of critical trophic factors,
like BDNF to protect against brain injury in peri-infarct regions.
In addition, subpopulations of reactive astrocytes in the periinfract cortex and striatum proliferate and express proteins
commonly associated with neural stem/progenitor cells, such as

nestin and vimentin in response to cerebral ischemia. Studies suggest that reactive astrocyte-derived neural stem/progenitor cells
can self-renew and differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Shimada et al., 2012). Therefore, future studies should
attempt to elucidate relationships between reactive astrocytederived BDNF and differentiation of neural stem cells in peri-infract
regions.
4.1. Limitations
The function of reactive astrocytes in stroke and other neural
injuries remains controversial, in that both beneﬁcial and detrimental properties are postulated. Reactive astrocytes contribute
to a long-lasting “glial scar”, which serves as a physical barrier
between the lesion and the surrounding tissue that releases a broad
range of inhibitory molecules against neurite outgrowth, axon and
neuron regeneration, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans
(CSPGs) (McKeon et al., 1991; Huang et al., 2014). However, the
present study did not focus on such changes in reactive astrocytederived inhibitory molecules after EA treatment, and long-term
observation of the proliferation of reactive astrocytes and secretion of BDNF is a necessary step to gain a further understanding of
these events and processes on neuroprotection and other processes
that occur after ischemic brain injury. Nevertheless, we believe our
study is a useful ﬁrst step toward accumulating knowledge concerning the inﬂuence and behavior of reactive astrocytes in the
ischemia-injured brain and after therapeutic interventions such as
EA.
