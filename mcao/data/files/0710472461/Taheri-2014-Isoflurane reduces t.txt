determine the expression level of HIF-1α (the regulatable subunit of HIF-1) and VEGF
proteins. Results: ISO inhalation during ischemia signiﬁcantly decreased the surge of infarct

rCBF, signiﬁcantly enhanced the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF, and decreased the
immune cell inﬁltration. Locomotor dysfunction was ameliorated at a signiﬁcantly faster
pace, and the beneﬁt was seen to persist up to three weeks. Conclusion: Treatment with ISO
during ischemia limits the deadly surge in the dynamics of ischemia reperfusion injury
with no observed long-term inverse effect.

hypoxia and the extent of secondary brain injury. To induce
tolerance against hypoxia, multiple pathways need to be
targeted including signaling to reduce energy expenditure
and secondary pathology as well as preventing downstream

174

signaling pathways triggered by ischemia (Ceulemans et al.,
2010; Leonardo and Pennypacker, 2009) via the activation of
transcription factors that drive the genomic responses to
hypoxia (Dirnagl et al., 2009). One of such important transcription factors is hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1, as a
transcription factor, exerts its effects through the expression
of proteins encoded by its downstream genes such as erythropoietin (epo), vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf), and glucose
transporter (glut) (Majmundar et al., 2010).
Increasing evidences suggest that isoﬂurane (ISO), a commonly used volatile anesthesia, induces ischemic tolerance
(Gwak et al., 2011; Johnsen and Murphy, 2011; Li et al., 2013b;
Lv et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2013; Takagaki et al., 2013; Zhang et al.,
2011), decreases ischemic brain injury, and reduces intracerebral
hemorrhage (ICH) (Fang Li et al., 2012; Hockel et al., 2012; Khatibi
et al., 2011).
Multiple ischemic tolerance pathways may be triggered by
ISO preconditioning in concert with the downstream signaling during hypoxia (Bedirli et al., 2012; Cao et al., 2012; Gwak
et al., 2011; Yin et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2010). ISO-induced
upregulation of HIF-1α, the regulatable subunit of HIF-1,
during hypoxia in vitro has already been reported (Li et al.,
2006; Li et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2014). Elevated HIF-1α levels
are shown to ameliorate ischemic brain injury (Chen et al.,
2008; Ockaili et al., 2005; Sheldon et al., 2009) through
inhibiting occludin expression (Zhao et al., 2014). Furthermore, ISO post-conditioning increases the downstream gene
expression of HIF-1, including VEGF (Fang Li et al., 2012).
Some reports emphasize that ISO may temporally impede
the progression and may transiently delay the onset of
cerebral infarction (Altay et al., 2012; Kawaguchi et al., 2000;
Sasaoka et al., 2009). However, the long-term outcome of
post-treatment with ISO and the dynamic of HIF-1α expression after treatment are not studied. In the present study, we
tested the hypothesis that treatment with ISO during ischemia affects the ischemic cascades and evokes the activation
of the transcription factor, HIF-1. In parallel, the expression of
the downstream protein VEGF is also increased ultimately
alleviating the progression of infarction after reperfusion. We
evaluated longitudinally the effect of ISO post-treatment on
the evolution of ischemic lesion and outcomes in a middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) rat model of ischemia by
using multimodal noninvasive, quantitative MRI imaging
techniques. The evolution of lesion volume, tissue integrity,
and regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) were assessed and
correlated with behavioral and histological data.

Results

2.1.

ISO impeded the infarct volume

Representative images of longitudinal evolution of brain
infarct volume (T2 MRI; coronal section) of MCAo rats is given
in Fig. 1 (panel A). We observed two distinct phases in the
evolution of ischemic lesion in all the groups. The ﬁrst phase
dominated by increasing lesion volume occurred during the
reperfusion injury (up to 72 h after MCAo). The lesion volume
reached the maximum at 48 h and then started declining
during the recovery phase (72 h after reperfusion). During

both the injury and recovery phases, the overall lesion
volume and cortical lesion volume in MCAoþISO rats were
signiﬁcantly smaller than the MCAo rats. This difference was
recorded also during the injury phase (po 0.001). There was
no signiﬁcant difference in the evolution of cortical and
subcortical lesion during the recovery phase (Fig. 1C & D).
However, there was a difference in the evolution pattern of
cortical and subcortical lesion during the injury phase (Fig. 1C
& D). In addition, while the subcortical lesion showed a
continuous decrease over time, the cortical lesion reached
the nadir on day 7 after reperfusion. Further, in the present
study, ICH was observed in 30% of MCAo rats (Fig. 1A: MCAo:
arrows) while none of MCAoþISO rats developed ICH (Fig. 1A:
MCAoþISO). Analysis on the effect of ISO on the lesion
volume after MCAo revealed no statistically signiﬁcant differences with the non-treated group (p¼ 0.06). However, further
analysis of different time points revealed signiﬁcant changes
in lesion volume over time in both groups. Wald test statistics
used to test treatment and time effect revealed group time
differences (P¼ 0.02). ISO reduces the relative treatment effect
(RTE) of MCAO from 0.57 to 0.42 while this reduction was
more pronounced at 12 h, 24 h, and 72 h after reperfusion
(Fig. 1E).
Furthermore, the spatial analysis of the data revealed the
same trend of effect for ISO on RTE of ischemia in striatum as in
the whole brain (Fig. 1F). However, Wald test revealed group
differences in striatum lesion between ISO and MCAo group
(p¼0.024). In the cortical area, the RTE of ischemia was reduced
from 0.58 to 0.42 but did not reach statistical signiﬁcance
(p¼0.076, Fig. 1G).

2.2.
ISO subsided edema and protected the tissue
microstructure
Representative color-coded directional FA maps of control,
MCAo, and MCAoþISO rats were generated from sequential
diffusion data during 21d after reperfusion represent the
dynamics of underlying microstructural changes (Fig. 2A).
Darker areas in the FA maps represent the decreased directional diffusion of water molecules characteristic of underlying edema along with microstructural changes. Statistical
comparisons between mean regional FA from experimental
groups in the contralateral and ipsilateral hemisphere are
given (Fig. 2B & C). It is evident from FA maps that signiﬁcant
changes occurred between the groups in both hemispheres.
We observed a reduction in the mean FA of the ipsilateral
hemisphere. In contrast, the mean FA in the contralateral
hemisphere was increased in MCAo rats and reached the
maximum at 48 h after reperfusion. Also, we observed that
the difference between the mean FA in the ipsilateral and
contralateral hemisphere was at its peak at that point. Seven
days after reperfusion, the mean FA of contralateral hemisphere returned to the basal value. At 21d after reperfusion,
the mean of FA values of both the hemispheres approximated
to the basal value. Interestingly, we observed that ISO group
had less deviation in the mean FA in both hemispheres
(compare panel B with C). RTE of ISO on ipsilateral hemisphere FA was signiﬁcant (po0.001) (Fig. 2D), while the effect
of ISO on contralateral hemisphere was not signiﬁcant
(Fig. 2E).

differences. E), F), and G) represent RTE of ISO on lesion volume in whole, cortical, and subcortical areas of brain, respectively.

ISO altered the regional CBF

Representative color-coded rCBF longitudinally measured after
reperfusion in a MCAo rat and a MCAoþISO rat represent the
longitudinal impact of ISO on rCBF after IR injury (Fig. 3A). There
was a signiﬁcant decrease (30%; po0.01) in the ipsilateral rCBF of
MCAo and MCAoþISO rats at 72 h after reperfusion (po0.05).
Then the rCBF normalized to the control value. In contrast, we
observed a signiﬁcant increase (10%; po0.05) in the rCBF of the

contralateral hemisphere after the ischemic insult. Relative CBF
was maximum at 24 h after reperfusion and then declined to 5%
less than that of the control value. The rCBF recovered to the
original value during the recovery phase following the 72 h
reperfusion/injury period. Interestingly, there was a global
change in the rCBF after ischemia. However, the change in the
contralateral rCBF was smaller than that of the ipsilateral hemisphere (Fig. 3B & C). Longitudinal analysis of the effect of ISO on
hemispherical CBF after MCAo revealed that there was no

post-ischemia change in FA. Wald type statistics (WTS) was performed for analyzing longitudinal group differences. Panel D
compares RTE of ISO in ipsilateral area and panel E compares RTE of ISO in contralateral area. The effect of ISO on ipsilateral
FA was signiﬁcant (po0.001), while the effect of ISO on contralateral hemisphere was not signiﬁcant. n—control: 12, MCAO:

statistically signiﬁcant differences compared with the nontreated group (Fig. 3D & E). However, rCBF was changed igniﬁcantly (po0.01) in both the hemispheres of MCAo and
MCAoþISO rats over the time.

ISO enhanced survival and behavioral recovery

With respect to the body weight, both experimental groups
showed an initial decrease after MCAo, but started regaining

body weight during the recovery phase (Fig. 4A). The results also
demonstrated that the MCAoþISO animals regained body weight
at a faster rate than the MCAo group. However, longitudinal
analysis of effect of ISO on the weight loss after MCAo revealed
no statistically signiﬁcant difference compared with the MCAo
group of rats.

Isoﬂurane post-conditioning signiﬁcantly increased the survival rate in IR injury rats (Fig. 4B). No sham operated animals died
during the experiment. The ISO proportional hazard on the
survival was rho¼ 0.496 (P ¼.004), emphasizing the beneﬁcial
effect of ISO on the survival of rats after MCAo (Fig. 4B).
MCAoþISO rats also recovered locomotor function at a

intervention (n¼ 22 after MCAo) monitored for 21 days for weight loss. Longitudinal weight data were analyzed for RTE. Wald
type statistics (WTS) were performed for analyzing group differences. Note that in the later time points, the sample size
becomes smaller due to the mortality and subject removal to comply with the animal protocol on weight loss restrictions.

signiﬁcantly faster rate than MCAo rats and the difference
persisted up to day 21 (Fig. 4C).

2.5.

ISO inhibited the immune cell inﬁltration

Representative H&E stained brain sections showing ISOmediated inhibition on immune cell inﬁltration are given in
Fig. 5. There was a statistically signiﬁcant increase in the
number of inﬁltrated immune cells in the brain parenchyma
after IR injury. In addition, most of the inﬁltrating cells were
found to be CD11b positive (Fig. 5C). There was a signiﬁcant
difference in the number of inﬁltrating CD11b cells between
control, MCAo, and MCAoþISO groups on all the three days
tested. The number of CD11b positive cells in the control
group was 3.872.3 on day 1 post-sham operation. We did not
encounter any CD11b positive cells in sham control rats on
day 3 and 7 post-surgery. MCAoþISO rats showed 26.873.6,
12.673.0, and 10.475.2, respectively, on day 1, 3, and 7 postMCAo. The respective values of MCAo group were 59.677.9,
41.874.8, and 23.475.2 (Fig. 5D). The difference in the
number of CD11b positive cells was statistically signiﬁcant
between the groups (po0.001).

the groups on all the three days tested. This data suggests
that the ISO-mediated beneﬁcial effects on MCAo rats may be
through the HIF-1α signaling pathway.

ISO upregulated HIF-1α and VEGF expression

ISO treatment signiﬁcantly increased the HIF-1α and VEGF
protein expression after IR injury compared with control and
MCAo group of rats (Fig. 6A). The representative Western
blots and analysis results for 3 days post-MCAo are given
(Fig. 6B & C). Statistically signiﬁcant (po0.01) differences in
the HIF-1α and VEGF protein expression were seen between

Discussion

The uniqueness of the present report is that for the ﬁrst time
a longitudinal MRI study has been carried out to understand
the effect of ISO on IR injury in a rat MCAo model. Our data
demonstrates inhalation of 2% ISO during ischemia: (1)
reduces the infarct and edema volume and ICH, (2) decreases
immune cell inﬁltration into brain parenchyma, (3) augments
the expression of pro-angiogenic factors, (4) alters the rCBF,
and (5) increases the survival rate after IR injury and speeds
up the locomotor functional recovery.
Reports are available on the neuroprotective effect of ISO
(Fang Li et al., 2012; Lemoine et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2011).
However, the status of cerebral injury was evaluated at a
single ﬁxed time point after the intervention, which may not
reveal the complete course of ISO-mediated neuroprotection.
Hence in the present study, we made a protensive observation on the inﬂuence of ISO-mediated neuroprotection and
demonstrated that treatment of ischemic rats with ISO
renders valuable temporal beneﬁt on the evolution of infarction. We measured ischemic volume, the extent of edema
and rCBF longitudinally at different time points presumed to
be the critical points in the progression of ischemia (Taheri
et al., 2009) and analyzed the data for single time point
signiﬁcance and longitudinal effects.

Temporal analysis of our data shows that ISO signiﬁcantly
reduced the edema and ischemia at early times (o 72 h).
However, there was no signiﬁcant reduction in edema at the
later time points (4 7d). The in vivo MRI data obtained in the
present study corroborates with previous reports of reduced
infarction only at early time points with ISO therapy
(Kawaguchi et al., 2000).

In a multimodal MR imaging experiment, we longitudinally measured the diffusion parameters (FA and MD) and T2related infarction volume along with ASL measurement of
rCBF. Diffusion and T2-weighted MRI along with rCBF map
adequately represent the temporal evolution of ischemic
brain injury (Ozsunar et al., 2004; Sotak, 2002). Changes in
FA in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere are well anticipated
due to focal ischemia. However, to our surprise, we did
observe an increase in the mean FA in the contralateral
hemisphere also. This observation insinuates structural
remodeling in the mirror regions of the other hemisphere is

180

brain research 1586 (2014) 173–183

occurring as previously reported by Granziera et al. (Granziera
et al., 2012). This observation further supports that the spatial
response against any focal ischemic insult is in fact a global
one. In support of this hypothesis, we have found ISO to
inﬂuence FA and MD in both the cerebral hemispheres, even
though, the insult was inﬂicted to the right hemisphere
(Fig. 2). In addition, the longitudinal analyses reveal a transient alteration of rCBF, FA, and MD. These observations
further supports the hypothesis that the surviving rats in
both groups had less deviations in biomarkers of ischemia
measured by quantitative imaging techniques.
Deviation in the FA from the basal value is due to changes
in the microstructural components of the brain, metabolic
changes, and the activation status of the microglia
(Ramlackhansingh et al., 2011). The shift in differential
organization of microglia contributing to the altered FA in
and around the infarct zone has been reported recently (Thiel
et al., 2010). Transformed intracellular environment of microglia as recorded with immunohistochemical studies also
contribute to this process (Schroester, et al., 1999). We
observed ISO to signiﬁcantly decrease the number of activated microglial cells in the penumbra region as measured
with CD11b positive reactivity. Hence, the beneﬁcial effect of
ISO observed in the present may be through decreasing the
number of activated microglia in the penumbra (Thiel et al.,
2010).
Ischemic stroke, through immune cell inﬁltration and
microglial activation, provokes inﬂammatory cascades
(Zhou et al., 2013). Hence, anti-inﬂammatory approaches
have been suggested to mitigate the progression of inﬂammation due to ischemia and protect the penumbra from the
radiating deleterious effect of IR injury (del Zoppo et al., 2000).
HIF-1α and VEGF pathways have been suggested as the
prime neuroprotective pathways involved in ISO-mediated
neuroprotection (Hieber et al., 2009; Li et al., 2008; Sun et al.,
2013). HIF-1 is a transcription factor that exerts its effect
through downstream genes including VEGF and regulates the
expression of inﬂammatory markers on endothelial cells
(Majmundar et al., 2010). Data obtained in the present study
supports that ISO upregulates the expression of HIF-1α and
VEGF in ischemic brain tissue also conﬁrming the vascular
protective effect of ISO. Our ﬁnding that ISO-mediated HIF-1α
and VEGF upregulation is also in corroboration with earlier
in vitro experiments (Hieber et al., 2009; Li et al., 2008; Sun
et al., 2013).
The reduction in the ICH and the mortality rate may be
considered as fruition of the increased cerebral microvascular
reperfusion (indicated by mean rCBF) brought about by ISO.
Locomotor deﬁcits and dysfunction are the most pronounced
disabilities in stroke patients. Locomotor dysfunction mostly
results from the ischemic damage to motor neuronal tracts.
Studying locomotor function following ischemia provides additional insights into the efﬁcacy of ISO therapy. Rotarod is a
sensitive method to evaluate motor impairment in the cortex
after focal ischemia in rats. Our data demonstrate that ISO
administration during ischemia signiﬁcantly improved the
locomotor function. In the present study, MCAoþISO rats
recovered from the locomotor deﬁcit signiﬁcantly faster than
the MCAo rats. The improvement in the locomotor function is
also consistent with the reduction in the ischemic volume and

increase in rCBF in MCAoþISO rats. Hence, it can be concluded
that treatment with ISO before reperfusion may also improve
the sensorimotor deﬁciencies with stroke patients.
The present study also has some caveats: Most stroke
patients also have other comorbid ailments like hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. Such pathological
conditions may alter the efﬁcacy of post-conditioning with
ISO on cerebral vascular tissues. For example, Hu et al. (Hu
et al., 2011) have reported that ISO administration at the
onset of reperfusion in rat model of hyperglycemia worsen
the physiological and neurological outcomes. However, more
studies are needed to understand the effect of ISO on
animals/patients with preexisting vascular and other pathological conditions. The incidence of stroke predominantly
occurs over the age of 65y in humans (Go et al., 2013).
The present study was carried out with young adult rats
(3 m). In addition, it is a well-established fact that young and
aged rats respond to different ISO levels (Stratmann et al.,
2009; Zhu et al., 2010). Hence, the appropriateness of the age
of the animal model in relation to human patients needs to
be given consideration. Regarding the dose of ISO, 2% ISO was
selected in the present study because the dose has been
largely used in animal models without any serious side
effects (Pal et al., 2012). In addition, it is known that the
minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of ISO required to
induce anesthesia is 0.7, which is equal to 1.89%. Therefore,
the ISO used in the present study (2%) is slightly less than 1
MAC (2.7% equals 1 MAC) (Holdcroft et al., 1999). Finally,
determining a target dose for clinical translation is complicated by the different metabolic rates and fate of ISO in
human and rat liver microsomes (Bradshaw and Ivanetich,
1984). The other limitation of this study is the use of ISO also
during the surgery and MR imaging. This may have confounding or synergistic effect on the observed neuroprotection. However, as the effect of ISO is dose dependent (Li et al.,
2013a), we did have control over the indiscriminate use of ISO
during surgery and imaging by allocating exact timing to the
procedures.
In conclusion, our data provide evidence that treatment of
ISO during ischemia supports a long-term protective effect
and demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that ISO limits the extent
of IR injury. Our study attributes the vascular protective role
along with neuroprotection to ISO therapy that limits the IR
injury. This study also provides a novel speculation to the
translational aspect of ISO therapy. ISO treatment during
ischemia is clinically feasible by transporting stroke patients
from the site of incidence to the hospital under ISO anesthesia. This early neuroprotective ISO therapy could increase the
chance of survival and faster recovery from IR injury.

Experimental procedure

4.1.

Subjects

Male Wistar-Kyoto rats (280–310 g) purchased from Charles
River Laboratory (Wilmington, MA) were housed individually
in the animal facility at 12 h light/dark cycle, and acclimatized for 1 week before the experiments begin. All animal
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care

brain research 1586 (2014) 173–183

and Use Committee (IACUC) of Medical University of South
Carolina (protocol 3019) and the NIH Guidelines for survival
rodent surgery. Rats were randomly assigned to three
groups: Control (n¼ 15), MCAo (n ¼35), and MCAoþisoﬂurane
(MCAoþISO: n ¼ 35).

4.2.

Surgical preparation and ISO conditioning

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) was performed by
the same surgeon (S.T.) following intraluminal ﬁlament
model as previously described (Taheri et al., 2009). Reperfusion was done 90 min after ischemia by gentle withdrawal of
the suture. Sham animals (control) underwent neck surgery
just with the suture inserted and removed. 4.0% ISO was used
for induction and 2.0% for maintenance. MCAoþISO rats were
maintained under 2% ISO during the ischemic phase (90 min)
at a temperature of 37.570.5 1C. All rats were given a
subcutaneous bolus of 10 ml sterile saline to compensate
the water loss incurred during surgery. Successful MCAo was
conﬁrmed by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) (Moor Instruments, Wilmington, DE) as previously reported (Yan et al.,
2011). Rats whose regional CBF dropped to 15.471.8% of the
pre-ischemic level, and after reperfusion, the CBF restored to
90.573.6% of pre-ischemic level was used in further experiments. Vital signs (blood pressure, core temperature, and
heart and respiratory rate) were monitored using a SAII
Monitoring System (Small Animal Instruments, Inc. Stony
Brook, NY). Body weight was monitored every day and the
rats were excluded from the study if the body weight dropped
by 20% of baseline body weight.

Behavioral test

Latency of rats on rotarod was measured as described previously (Shunmugavel et al., 2013). All animals were trained
on an automated 4-lane rotarod (Columbus instruments,
Columbus, OH) for 5 days before the surgery. All testing were
done during the light cycle of the same time of the day (9:00–
11:00 AM). Locomotor functional recovery was tested on days
1,2,3,4,7,14, and 21 after MCAo. Total time in seconds that the
animal could stay on the rotarod drum was recorded using
the computer peripheral attached to the device. Each animal
was given three trials with 10 min inter-testing interval and
the mean latency was taken for the ﬁnal calculation.

4.4.

Neuroimaging

MR imaging at 6, 12, 24, 48 h, and 7, 14, and 21d after MCAo
was performed with 7T BioSpec MR Scanner (Bruker Biospin),
equipped with 500 mT/m gradient set and a small bore linear
RF coil. MR protocol included anatomical, diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI), and CBF. T2-weighted (T2w) images were
acquired in the coronal plane centered 5 mm caudal from
the posterior edge of the olfactory bulb using the RARE (Rapid
Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement) sequence (TR/TE
4000/65 ms, ﬁeld of view (FOV) 3.7 cm x 3.7 cm, slice thickness
2 mm, slice gap 0.1 mm, contiguous slices 12, matrix
256  128, number of averages 5).
DTI-EPI sequence was used to acquire diffusion images
with the same geometrical parameters as anatomical images

181

but a smaller matrix size (128  128 and TR/TE 3800/44.7 ms,
30 diffusion per direction, number of averages 1, d/D¼ 5/
10 ms, and b value of 0 and 1000 s mm  2). Regional CBF was
quantiﬁed with continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL)
technique with single-shot, gradient-echo, echo-planar
image acquisition (FAIR-EPI) (Moffat et al., 2005). The labeling
pulse was a 1.78-s, square radiofrequency pulse in the
presence of 1.0 G/cm gradient along the ﬂow direction (TR/
TE 3300/29 ms, number of TIR 24, FOV 3.7 cm x 3.7 cm, slice
thickness 1 mm, slice gap 0.1 mm, number of slices 3, matrix
128  128 and number of averages 1).

4.5.

Image processing

All the data were processed using custom written software in
MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA). The anatomical images
were coregistered by rigid body alignment to a rat brain
template. The transformation parameters of each animal
were then applied to subsequent images. Ischemic lesion
volume was determined by thresholding T2 images with
values above mean plus two standard deviations of contralateral measurements. DTI data were processed to generate
maps of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA).
CBF was calculated by using FAIR ASL ﬁtting equation(Detre
et al., 2009). Hemispheric average of CBF values of each slice
was calculated by using manually drawn ROIs and represented as mean7SEM (ml/100 g/min).

4.6.

Immunoﬂuorescence and Western blot analyses

For histology and immunoﬂuorescence studies: after the
imaging session (1, 3, and 7d post-MCAo), the animals were
sacriﬁced using excess Nembutal (150 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with PBS solution followed by 10% formalin.
The brain was extracted and post-ﬁxed in 10% formalin
overnight. Tissues were processed following routine histological procedure. Parafﬁn-embedded sections were cut (5 mm
thick) and used for H&E staining and immunoﬂuorescence
staining. Sections were visualized under epi-ﬂuorescence
microscope (Olympus, CenterValley, PA) and recorded using
image pro Plus 5.1software. CD11b positive cells were counted
in at least ten microscopic frames of the penumbra region of
the lesion. Independent scoring was also performed by an
investigator blinded to the experimental groups.
For Western blot analysis, the brain tissue was extracted
after perfusion with PBS and homogenized in RIPA (radio
immune precipitation assay) buffer with protease inhibitors.
Protein concentrations were determined using protein assay
dye from Bio-Rad laboratories (Hercules, CA). Equal quantity
(50 mg) protein was resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred
to nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk
in 0.01% Tween-20 and incubated with primary antibodies
(HIF-1α & VEGF; Millipore, Billerica, MA) followed by
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature and visualized via enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL). β-actin expression
level was used as the loading control. The densitometry
analysis of the Western blots was done using NIH image-J
software.

Statistical analyses

For statistical analysis, “R” (version 3.0.2, R Development Core
Team 2013) was used. Effect of ISO and time points on lesion
volume after MCAo was analyzed using a package “nparLD”
(http://www.r-project.org/) designed to perform nonparametric analysis of longitudinal data in factorial experiments. Non-parametric variance analysis for repeated experimental designs with f1-ld-f1 model (Noguchi et al., 2012) was
used to analyze the longitudinal effect of ISO on lesion
volume, rCBF, FA, and weight loss. Relative treatment effect
(RTE) (Brunner et al., 2002) was calculated to investigate the
longitudinal relative effect of ISO on body weight of the
animals. Wald test statistic (Lee et al., 1996) was calculated
for testing signiﬁcance of group and time effects and interactions in longitudinal setting. In the data, 13 rats are in the
control group while the remaining 22 rats are in treatment
group that observed for eight times (repeated measures).
Parametric statistical comparisons between the data sets
were made based on the representation of mean7SEM unless
otherwise stated. Student's t-test (parametric data) was used
for statistical analyses. Statistical analyses between groups
were performed using two-way repeated measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey HSC post-hoc test for
multiple comparisons. We have used Cox proportional
hazards regression model (Miller, 2011), a semi parametric
model, to analyze the effect of ISO on survival after MCAo.
MCAo without intervention (n¼16) and with ISO (n¼22) was
monitored for 21 days for survival studies. po0.05 was
considered as a signiﬁcant difference.
