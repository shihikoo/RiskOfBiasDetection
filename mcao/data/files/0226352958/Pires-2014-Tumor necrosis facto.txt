hypertension; cerebral vascular remodeling; ischemic stroke; tumor
necrosis factor-␣; macrophages/microglia

are a major cause of adult disability in developed countries (15). In recent years much effort has
been directed to developing neuroprotective strategies to improve the outcome of cerebral ischemia, with few translational
achievements. Primary prevention remains an important strategy to manage individuals at risk of having a stroke. Hypertension is a primary risk factor for stroke, and hypertensioninduced remodeling of cerebral arteries has been linked to
larger infarcts following experimentally induced cerebral ischemia (9, 39). The mechanisms underlying hypertensive cerebral artery remodeling have not been fully elucidated, but we
recently showed that macrophage-mediated vascular inflammation is involved in this process (35).

Inflammatory mediators play a role in the pathophysiology
of hypertension and end-organ damage. Many circulating factors known to be important in hypertension induce vascular
inflammation, including angiotensin II (28), aldosterone (3),
and endothelin-I (41). These factors are also associated with
hypertensive vascular remodeling (21, 38, 48). Thus, it is
possible that vascular inflammation is in part responsible for
the remodeling and vascular damage induced by these vasoactive mediators, particularly through proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-␣. We recently proposed that TNF-␣
might be involved in hypertensive remodeling of both the
cerebral and mesenteric vasculatures (35). Furthermore, other
studies showed that TNF-␣ is involved in the renal damage
observed in hypertensive salt-sensitive rats (10, 11), and
TNF-␣ inhibition reduces infarct size following cerebral ischemia in normotensive rats (45). Thus we hypothesized that
TNF-␣ inhibition with etanercept (ETN) would attenuate remodeling of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and mesenteric
resistance arteries (MRA) in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). We further hypothesized that the
improvement in MCA structure would reduce infarct size after
cerebral ischemia. The structure of the MCA and third order
MRA was assessed by pressure myography. Pial perfusion was
measured by scanning laser Doppler flowmetry, and cerebral
ischemia was induced using the intraluminal suture model for
MCA occlusion.
MATERIAL AND METHODS

Animals and treatment. Six-week-old male SHRSP from the colony
housed at Michigan State University were randomized into two
groups: one group was treated with the TNF-␣ inhibitor ETN (1.25
mg/kg ip daily) or an equal volume of PBS (vehicle) ip daily. Rats
were treated with ETN or PBS from 6 to 12 wk of age. We have
previously shown that treatments during this period are efficacious in
attenuating vascular remodeling (34 –36). Rats were maintained on a
12-h:12-h light/dark cycle, with tap water and regular chow ad
libitum. At 12 wk of age, rats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane,
weighed, and euthanized by decapitation after exsanguination. All
organs used in this study were harvested after decapitation. The
experimental protocol was approved by the Michigan State University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and was in accordance
with the American Physiological Society’s Guiding Principles in the
Care and Use of Animals.
A separate group of naive, previously untreated 12-wk-old male
SHRSP was used to assess the effects of acute ETN treatment on the
outcome of cerebral ischemia. Rats subjected to transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO; protocol described below) received ETN (1.25 mg/kg ip) or equivolume PBS at reperfusion and
24 h after ischemia.
Measurement of arterial pressure. Blood pressure during the last
week of treatment was measured by tail-cuff using a RTBP1001
tail-cuff blood pressure system (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT) as
described previously (34).

Tumor necrosis factor-␣ inhibition attenuates middle cerebral artery
remodeling but increases cerebral ischemic damage in hypertensive
rats. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 307: H658 –H669, 2014. First
published July 11, 2014; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00018.2014.—Hypertension causes vascular inflammation evidenced by an increase in
perivascular macrophages and proinflammatory cytokines in the arterial wall. Perivascular macrophage depletion reduced tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)-␣ expression in cerebral arteries of hypertensive rats and
attenuated inward remodeling, suggesting that TNF-␣ might play a
role in the remodeling process. We hypothesized that TNF-␣ inhibition
would improve middle cerebral artery (MCA) structure and reduce
damage after cerebral ischemia in hypertensive rats. Six-week-old male
stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were treated with
the TNF-␣ inhibitor etanercept (ETN; 1.25 mg·kg⫺1·day⫺1 ip daily) or
PBS (equivolume) for 6 wk. The myogenic tone generation, postischemic dilation, and passive structure of MCAs were assessed by
pressure myography. Cerebral ischemia was induced by MCA occlusion (MCAO). Myogenic tone was unchanged, but MCAs from
SHRSP ⫹ ETN had larger passive lumen diameter and reduced wall
thickness and wall-to-lumen ratio. Cerebral infarct size was increased
in SHRSP ⫹ ETN after transient MCAO, despite an improvement in
dilation of nonischemic MCA. The increase in infarct size was linked
to a reduction in the number of microglia in the infarct core and
upregulation of markers of classical macrophage/microglia polarization. There was no difference in infarct size after permanent MCAO
or when untreated SHRSP subjected to transient MCAO were given
ETN at reperfusion. Our data suggests that TNF-␣ inhibition attenuates hypertensive MCA remodeling but exacerbates cerebral damage
following ischemia/reperfusion injury likely due to inhibition of the
innate immune response of the brain.

Pressure myography studies. MCA function and structure were
assessed by pressure myography (Danish Myo Technology, Aarhus,
Denmark) as described previously (36). Briefly, we analyzed MCA
spontaneous myogenic tone generation and structural and mechanical
properties. MCAs were equilibrated in oxygenated (95%O2-5% CO2)
physiological salt solution (PSS) containing (in mmol) 141.9 NaCl,
4.7 KCl, 1.12 KH2PO4, 1.7 MgSO4·7H2O, 2.8 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 5
dextrose, and 0.5 EDTA (pH 7.4) until development of spontaneous
myogenic tone, which was calculated using the following formula:
%tone ⫽ [1 ⫺ (active lumen diameter/passive lumen diameter)] ⫻
100. Passive structure was assessed with calcium-free PSS containing
2 mmol/l EGTA plus 10 ␮mol/l sodium nitroprusside (SNP), and
intraluminal pressure was increased from 3 to 180 mmHg in 20mmHg increments. The wall-to-lumen ratio and circumferential wall
stress were calculated (2). Passive distensibility was calculated as
described previously (7). The elastic modulus (␤-coefficient) was
calculated from the stress/strain curves using an exponential model
(y ⫽ ae␤x), where ␤ is the slope of the curve and is directly correlated
to vascular stiffness.
MRA passive structure was assessed with calcium-free PSS containing 2 mmol/l EGTA plus 10 ␮mol/l sodium nitroprusside, and
intraluminal pressure was increased from 3 to 180 mmHg with
30-mmHg increments. All structural parameters analyzed in the MCA
were analyzed in the MRA.
MCA occlusion. Cerebral ischemia was induced using the intraluminal suture model of MCA occlusion (26). Rats were initially
anesthetized with isoflurane in an induction chamber, and anesthesia
was maintained with 2% isoflurane in oxygen; body temperature was
maintained at 37°C. An incision was made in the top of the head to
expose the skull for measurement of pial perfusion by scanning laser
Doppler flowmetry and attachment of a laser Doppler flow probe to
measure perfusion to the region supplied by the MCA (5 mm lateral
and 1 mm posterior to the bregma). A midline incision was made to
expose the carotid artery. The lingual and thyroid arteries were
cauterized, and the external carotid was tied off with suture. A 3-0
nylon monofilament with a rounded end (Doccol, Redland, CA) was
inserted into the common carotid artery. This monofilament was then
advanced through the internal carotid artery to block blood flow to the
MCA where it branches from the circle of Willis. MCA occlusion was
verified by a drop in perfusion as measured by both scanning laser
Doppler flowmetry and the Doppler flow probe. One set of rats was
subjected to transient ischemia (tMCAO). The MCAO was performed
as described above, and ischemia was maintained for 1 h. Reperfusion
was achieved by retracting the monofilament until its round end was
visible in the common carotid artery. Reperfusion was maintained for
47 h. Rats were then anesthetized and decapitated, and the brain was
removed and sliced into 2-mm sections for subsequent staining with
2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride for 20 min to assess ischemic
damage. With this staining the area of viable tissue will stain pink and
areas of infarcted tissue will remain white. Brain slices were fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde, and digital images were taken. The percentage
of infarction was determined by the following equation: %hemisphere
infarcted ⫽ ((VC - VL)/VC)*100, where VC is the volume of normal

tissue in the nonischemic hemisphere and VL is the volume of normal
tissue in the ischemic hemisphere (46).
Another set of rats was subject to permanent MCAO (pMCAO)
with the ischemia duration of 24 h, after which the rats were anesthetized and decapitated, the brain was removed, and measurement of
ischemic damage was performed as described above.
Scanning laser doppler flowmetry. Pial perfusion was measured as
described previously by our laboratory (36). Briefly, under anesthesia,
the rat’s skull was exposed and cleaned and pial perfusion was
analyzed in both cerebral hemispheres. The time points were analyzed
before surgery, immediately after MCAO, before and after reperfusion (in animals subjected to tMCAO), and immediately before
euthanasia. Mean perfusion in each hemisphere was measured using
the LDPIwin 3.1 software (Perimed). Pial perfusion data are expressed a percentage of pre-ischemic pial perfusion in each hemisphere (for MCAO studies) or perfusion units (for basal perfusion).
Dilation of the nonischemic MCA after tMCAO. Endothelial function in the nonischemic MCA was assessed by intraluminal perfusion
of ADP in a pressure myograph. A branch-free segment of the MCA
from the nonischemic hemisphere (contralateral) was isolated and
mounted between two glass cannulas in a pressure myograph chamber, which was then placed in an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse
T100; Nikon, Japan) coupled to a camera. The MCA was then bathed
in PSS, pressurized at 80 mmHg, and maintained under physiological
flow rate (20 dynes/cm2) to generate spontaneous myogenic tone.
Increasing concentrations of ADP (0.1 nmol/l to 10 ␮mol/l) were then
added to the intraluminal perfusate, and changes in MCA diameter
were recorded using the MyoView software (Danish Myo Technology, Aarhus, Denmark).
To assess endothelium independent post-MCAO dilation, another
group of MCAs from the nonischemic hemisphere were isolated,
cannulated, and pressurized as described above and incubated with
increasing concentrations of the nitric oxide donor endotheliumindependent dilator SNP (1 nmol/l to 100 ␮mol/l).
Immunofluorescence. Quantification of microglia and macrophages
in the infarct core and peri-infarct region of SHRSP treated for 6 wk
with ETN or PBS was performed by immunofluorescence (IF), as
recently described (35). Briefly, 8 ␮m-thick cryosections of brain
were incubated with 10% normal horse serum for 2 h, then incubated
with primary antibodies against CD68 (marker of macrophages and
neutrophils, mouse monoclonal anti-rat CD68; Abcam) or Iba-1
(marker of microglia, goat polyclonal anti-rat Iba-1; Abcam) for 24 h
in a shaker at room temperature. Secondary antibodies conjugated to
fluorescent probes were used to identify immunoreactivity. Slides

roni’s correction for multiple comparisons was performed as a posttest. All statistical analyses were carried out using the GraphPad Prism
6.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Difference between means
was considered statistically significant when P ⬍ 0.05.
RESULTS

Physiological variables. Data regarding body and organ
weight and blood pressure is summarized in Table 1. Briefly,
ETN treatment did not alter final body weight, heart:body
weight, and kidney:body weight in SHRSP. There was a small
but insignificant (P ⫽ 0.10) decrease in blood pressure in
SHRSP ⫹ ETN when compared with SHRSP ⫹ PBS.
MCA myogenic tone. To assess if TNF-␣ inhibition alters the
function of the MCA in SHRSP, we assessed spontaneous
myogenic generation at 80 mmHg. We observed that there was
no change in MCA spontaneous myogenic tone generation
(Table 2).
MCA passive structure. To test the hypothesis that TNF-␣ is
involved in MCA remodeling in SHRSP, we assessed MCA
structure and mechanical properties by pressure myography.
Treatment of SHRSP with ETN caused a small increase in the
outer diameter of the MCA (Fig. 1A). Lumen diameter was
significantly increased in SHRSP ⫹ ETN when compared with
SHRSP ⫹ PBS at intraluminal pressures above 40 mmHg (Fig.
1B). MCA wall thickness (Fig. 1C) and wall-to-lumen ratio
(Fig. 1D) were reduced by ETN treatment in SHRSP. Although
no changes were observed in the MCA cross-sectional area
(CSA), the lumen CSA was increased after ETN treatment, and
the wall CSA was decreased (Table 2). Wall stress was higher
in the MCA from SHRSP ⫹ ETN (Fig. 2A); there were no
differences in distensibility (Fig. 2B) and stiffness as measured
by the ␤-coefficient of the individual stress-strain relationships
(Table 2).

Fig. 1. TNF-␣ inhibition with etanercept
(ETN) improved the structure of the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Although there were no differences in the outer
diameter of the MCA (A), ETN treatment for
6 wk caused an increase in the lumen diameter (B), suggesting attenuation in the inward
remodeling process. Furthermore, there was
a reduction in hypertrophic growth of the
wall, observed as a decrease in the wall
thickness (C). Taken together, there was an
overall decrease in the wall-to-lumen ratio of
the MCA (D) in SHRSP ⫹ ETN. Data are

without the primary antibody were negative controls for immunospecificity of the antibodies, and slides without the secondary antibody were used to control for autofluorescence of the tissue. Coverslips were mounted on the slides using the mounting media ProLong
Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen Molecular Sciences,
Eugene, OR), which stains nuclei in blue. A total of 10 fields from the
infarct core were imaged per rat using a 40⫻ air objective (Zeiss
EC-Plan NeuFluar; numerical aperture 0.75), and five fields were
imaged from the peri-infarcted area. The peri-infarct area was morphologically identified as the parenchymal tissue that maintained
normal architecture immediately next to the infarct core. An investigator blinded to the experimental groups captured all images and
performed the quantification. Data are shown as number of positive
cells (Iba-1⫹ or CD68⫹)/infarct volume for the infarct core or as
number of positive cells/total number of DAPI-nuclei in the periinfarct area.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Markers of classical or alternative
activation of macrophages/microglia (M1 and M2, respectively) in the
ischemic hemisphere were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRTPCR). Total mRNA was isolated from the ischemic hemisphere of the
brain using a Qiagen RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences)
and reverse-transcribed using a qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quanta
Biosciences, Gaithesburg, MD). Quantitative PCR was then performed using Taqman ABI Assays on Demand probes in a 7,500 real
time PCR system (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA). Fold changes
from control were calculated using the 2⫺⌬⌬CT method (25) with
␤-2-microglobulin used as endogenous control, as described previously (32).
Chemical supplies. Unless otherwise stated, all chemical reagents
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
Statistical analyses. Body weight, heart:body weight, kidney:body
weight, blood pressure, spontaneous myogenic tone generation, basal
pial perfusion, infarct size (%HI), and IF data were analyzed by
Student’s t-test or a nonparametric alternative when the data did not fit
a normal distribution model. Data regarding MCA dilation to ADP,
MCA and MRA passive structure, and postischemic pial perfusion
were analyzed by two-way ANOVA or a nonparametric test. Bonfer-

Basal pial perfusion. To analyze if the improvement in
MCA structure caused a change in basal cerebral perfusion, we
assessed pial perfusion in anesthetized rats using scanning laser
Doppler flowmetry. We observed a small but significant increase in basal pial perfusion in ETN-treated SHRSP (Fig. 3A).
Transient MCAO. To test the hypothesis that improvement
in MCA structure would reduce the cerebral infarct in SHRSP,
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was experimentally induced by
tMCAO, with 1 h of ischemia and 47 h of reperfusion. Our data
shows that SHRSP treated with ETN for 6 wk had significantly
larger infarcts when compared with rats treated with PBS (Fig.
3B and Table 3), despite the observation that pial perfusion was
not different between groups at any of the time points studied

in both the ischemic (Fig. 3C) and nonischemic (Fig. 3D)
hemispheres. No infarct was observed in sham-operated
SHRSP (data not shown).
Postischemic endothelium-dependent dilation of the contralateral MCA. To evaluate if the increased infarct size
observed in SHRSP ⫹ ETN was due to impaired endothelial
function of cerebral arteries, we studied the dilatory response
of the nonischemic MCA to ADP. Postischemic dilation of the
nonischemic MCA ADP was reduced in SHRSP ⫹ PBS when
compared with rats that underwent sham surgery, and ETN
treatment recovered ADP-induced dilation of the MCA
(Fig. 4A). Normalization of the data by the passive diameter
of the MCA maintained the difference in dilation, showing
that the increased dilation was not an artifact of the reduced
inward remodeling (Fig. 4B). Dilation to the endotheliumindependent, nitric oxide donor SNP was slightly increased
in MCAs from SHRSP ⫹ ETN when compared with
SHRSP ⫹ PBS (Fig. 4C). However, the difference disappeared after normalization of the data by the passive diameter of the MCA (Fig. 4D).
Effects of acute ETN treatment. To assess if the increased
infarct observed after TNF-␣ inhibition was a consequence of
the chronic ETN treatment, a group of untreated 12-wk-old
SHRSP were subject to tMCAO and received either ETN or
PBS (1.25 mg/kg ip) at reperfusion and 24 h postischemia.
Using this experimental protocol, we observed that there were
no differences in infarct size (Fig. 5A and Table 3) or postischemic pial perfusion to the ischemic (Fig. 5B) and nonischemic hemispheres (Fig. 5C) between SHRSP that received PBS
or ETN at reperfusion.
Permanent MCAO. To evaluate if the larger cerebral infarct
observed in SHRSP ⫹ ETN after tMCAO was a consequence
of the reperfusion injury, a different group of SHRSP treated
with ETN for 6 wk underwent pMCAO with 24 h of ischemia.
There were no differences between SHRSP ⫹ PBS and
SHRSP ⫹ ETN in infarct size (Fig. 6A and Table 3) and pial
perfusion to the ischemic (Fig. 6B) and nonischemic (Fig. 6C)
hemispheres after pMCAO.
Post-MCAO survival. Data regarding post-MCAO survival
is summarized in Table 3. All rats subjected to tMCAO
survived for 48 h postischemia. However, five out of 11
SHRSP ⫹ PBS subjected to pMCAO did not survive for the
24 h poststroke (45% mortality), whereas six out of six
SHRSP ⫹ ETN subjected to pMCAO survived for 24 h (0%
mortality).
Immunofluorescence. IF staining showed that the number of
CD68⫹ cells (infiltrating macrophages; Fig. 7A) was not
changed in both the infarct core (Fig. 7B) and the peri-infarct
area (Fig. 7C) between experimental groups. However, the
number of Iba-1⫹ cells (microglia; Fig. 8A) was reduced in the
ischemic core of SHRSP ⫹ ETN when compared with
SHRSP ⫹ PBS (Fig. 8B), without changes in the number of
Iba-1⫹ cells in the peri-infarct area (Fig. 8C).
qRT-PCR. To investigate if ETN treatment caused differential macrophage/microglia polarization in the ischemic hemisphere, mRNA expression of various polarization markers was
assessed by qRT-PCR. We assessed TNF-␣, inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS), and C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)
as markers of classical (M1) activation and arginase-1, TGF-␤,
and macrophage mannose receptor 1 (MRC1) as markers of
alternative (M2) activation. There was a small but not signif-

toward an increase in the expression of iNOS (Fig. 9B; P ⫽
0.06) and a twofold increase in the mRNA expression for
CCR2 in the ischemic hemisphere of SHRSP ⫹ ETN when
compared with SHRSP ⫹ PBS (Fig. 9C). The M2 markers
arginase-1 (Fig. 9D), TGF-␤ (Fig. 9E), and MRC1 (Fig. 9F)
were not different between SHRSP ⫹ ETN and SHRSP ⫹
PBS.
MRA passive structure. To assess if the improvement in
vascular structure observed in the MCA after chronic ETN
treatment also occurred in peripheral vascular beds, we studied
the MRA. These data are summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 10.
Briefly, ETN treatment attenuated MRA remodeling, as evidenced by a trend toward increase in MRA lumen diameter
(Table 4; P ⫽ 0.065). The wall thickness was decreased after
ETN treatment (Fig. 10A), as was the wall-to-lumen ratio (Fig.
10B). Wall stress was increased in SHRSP ⫹ ETN (Table 4),
as was the MRA distensibility (Fig. 10C). MRA stiffness was
reduced in SHRSP ⫹ ETN, as observed by a reduction in the
␤-coefficient value (Table 4 and Fig. 10D).
DISCUSSION

an increase in lumen diameter and a decrease in wall thickness
and wall-to-lumen ratio; this was associated with an increase in
basal pial perfusion; 2) similar to the MCA, the passive
structure of the MRA was also improved, with ETN treatment
causing a reduction in wall thickness and wall-to-lumen ratio;
3) despite the improvement in the MCA structure, cerebral
infarct after tMCAO was increased in SHRSP ⫹ ETN, most
likely a consequence of impairment in the innate immune
response of the brain after chronic ETN treatment. To the best
of our knowledge this is the first report to show that chronic
TNF-␣ inhibition affects structural parameters of the vasculature independently of a reduction in blood pressure. It is also
the first study to assess the effects of chronic TNF-␣ inhibition
in the outcome of cerebral ischemia in hypertensive rodents.
The involvement of TNF-␣ in the development of hypertension has been elucidated in the recent years. Anti-TNF-␣
therapy caused a modest reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures in humans with rheumatoid arthritis (40).
In the angiotensin II-salt model of hypertension in rodents,
ETN treatment delayed the development of hypertension (11),
although after the delay the blood pressure was similar between
control and ETN-treated groups. Deletion of TNF-␣ in mice
prevented the rise in mean arterial pressure after angiotensin II
infusion, and this effect was lost after administration of exogenous TNF-␣, suggesting a direct link between TNF-␣ and
angiotensin II-induced hypertension (44). In our study we
observed a small but insignificant (P ⫽ 0.10) reduction in
systolic blood pressure in the genetically hypertensive SHRSP
after ETN treatment. One caveat of the present study is that
blood pressure was assessed by tail cuff instead of radiotelemetry. However, we showed previously that blood pressure
measurements in SHRSP using tail cuff are similar to those
obtained by radiotelemetry (39). Independently of the method
used, it is unlikely that a 10-mmHg reduction in blood pressure
will be physiologically relevant in SHRSP.
The main finding of this study is that ETN treatment during
the exponential rise in blood pressure in SHRSP attenuates

increase could be due to increased perfusion through the large
arteries of the Circle of Willis that feed into the pial circulation,
an increase in the lumen diameter of pial arteries and arterioles,
or a reduction in basal myogenic tone of cerebral arteries.
Although we did not observe reduced myogenic tone in the
MCA of SHRSP, a recent study showed that TNF-␣ mediates
increased myogenic tone in the posterior cerebral artery in
gerbils with heart failure (50).
Despite the improvement in the structure of the MCA,
SHRSP treated with ETN for 6 wk had larger infarcts after
tMCAO. This observation is in disagreement with a recent
report for normotensive animals (45). We hypothesized that the

Fig. 4. tMCAO reduces endothelium-dependent dilation of the nonischemic
MCA, which is prevented by ETN treatment. The vasodilatory capacity of the
nonischemic MCA (from the nonischemic hemisphere) was assessed in pressurized MCAs by intraluminal perfusion of ADP. tMCAO caused an impairment in ADP-mediated dilation of the MCA in SHRSP ⫹ PBS () when
compared with sham-operated SHRSP ({). This impairment seems to be
mediated, at least in part, by TNF-␣, since the MCA from SHRSP ⫹ ETN
subjected to tMCAO showed dilation similar to that observed in sham-operated
SHRSP (A). The improved dilation was not an artifact of the attenuation in
inward remodeling, since normalization of the dilation data by the passive
diameter maintained the difference (B). Dilation to the nitric oxide donor
endothelium-independent SNP was slightly increased in the MCA from
SHRSP ⫹ ETN, and normalization of the data by the passive diameter of the
MCA annulled the difference. Data are means ⫾ SE. *P ⬍ 0.01, 2-way

MCA remodeling. The inward remodeling process is thought
to be initially a protective process to increase vascular resistance and reduce intraluminal pressure in downstream arterioles and capillaries, thus preventing ruptures and hemorrhages
(16). However, in the long-term this process becomes maladaptive and is linked to increased risk of end-organ damage (31),
because it can have deleterious effects on local regulation of
blood flow. We observed an increase in lumen diameter and a
reduction in wall thickness and wall-to-lumen ratio in the MCA
of SHRSP after 6 wk of ETN treatment. This finding is not
without precedence, since TNF-␣ is a known proliferative
stimulus for vascular smooth muscle cells (20, 24, 37). TNF-␣
also induces the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (20). Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and
matrix metalloproteinases activity are involved in hypertensive
remodeling (36). The source of TNF-␣ in cerebral arteries
seems to be perivascular macrophages, since we recently
showed that reducing the number of these cells in the cerebral
vasculature reduces TNF-␣ mRNA expression and attenuates
MCA remodeling (35). We also observed a small increase in
basal pial perfusion in SHRSP after ETN treatment. This

assess whether the increase in cerebral infarct size after tMCAO in SHRSP was
linked to an acute effect of ETN during reperfusion injury, untreated 12-wk-old
SHRSP were subjected to tMCAO and treated with ETN (1.25 mg/kg) or PBS
(equivolume) at the time of reperfusion and 24 postischemia. After 47 h of
reperfusion, we observed that there was no difference in infarct size between
groups (A), as well as in pial perfusion in the ischemic (B) and nonischemic (C)
hemispheres. Data are means ⫾ SE.

increased infarct could be a consequence of reduced blood flow
due to impaired postreperfusion dilation of cerebral arteries or
an exacerbation of the reperfusion injury due to the chronic
immunosuppression. We will discuss these two hypotheses
separately.
To assess if ETN impairs postreperfusion vasodilation,
SHRSP were treated with ETN or PBS for 6 wk before
tMCAO, and we isolated the MCA from the nonischemic
hemisphere to study endothelium-dependent and independent
dilation. We observed that MCA from SHRSP subjected to
tMCAO showed reduced dilation to intraluminal perfusion of
ADP when compared with MCAs from sham-operated rats and

Fig. 6. Chronic ETN treatment did not increase infarct size after permanent
MCAO (pMCAO) in SHRSP. To assess if the increase in infarct size after
ischemia/reperfusion was associated with the reperfusion injury, SHRSP were
treated with ETN or PBS for 6 wk and subjected to pMCAO. After 24 h of
ischemia, we observed that there was no difference in infarct size between
groups (A). Pial perfusion in the ischemic (B) and nonischemic (C) hemispheres was also unchanged. Data are means ⫾ SE.

that ETN treatment restored dilation to levels similar to shamoperated rats. Dilation to the endothelium-independent, nitric
oxide donor SNP was slightly increased the nonischemic MCA
from SHRSP ⫹ ETN and disappeared after normalization of
the data by the passive diameter. However, the small increase
in dilation does not entirely explain the improved dilation
observed after exposure to ADP, suggesting a combination of
improved endothelial function and increased sensitivity of the
media layer to nitric oxide. Impaired endothelium-dependent
dilation of cerebral arteries postischemia occurs in the basilar
artery (8) and in peripheral vascular beds, including the mesenteric circulation (30). Our data suggest that part of the
endothelial dysfunction is mediated by TNF-␣. In fact, patients
with rheumatoid arthritis treated with anti-TNF-␣ therapies
show improved endothelium-dependent dilation of brachial
arteries (5, 12). In the MCA, ADP elicits dilation by endothelial production of nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) (52). TNF-␣ was shown to impair
dilations mediated by nitric oxide in coronary arteries (33) and
EDHF in human omental arteries (14). Importantly, EDHFmediated dilation is prevalent in the postischemic MCA (29). It
is possible that the prolonged ETN treatment either enhanced
the EDHF-mediated dilation or preserved nitric oxide-dependent dilation, leading to a dilatory response similar to that
observed in sham-operated SHRSP.
To test the hypothesis that the increased damage is a consequence of exacerbated reperfusion injury due to chronic
immunosuppression, we designed two studies. In the first we
subjected SHRSP treated with ETN for 6 wk to pMCAO; in the
second we subjected untreated SHRSP to tMCAO and administered ETN at the time of reperfusion and 24 h postischemia.
In both studies we observed that there were no differences in
infarct size or pial perfusion in ETN-treated SHRSP. Together,
these data suggest that the increase in infarct following tMCAO is likely due to a deleterious effect of the prolonged ETN
treatment on the outcome of reperfusion injury. Thus we
investigated the innate immune response in the brain after
reperfusion by IF.
A reduction in macrophage infiltration to the ischemic hemisphere could explain the increase in infarct size, since macrophages are important to remove cytotoxic cell debris (27).
Macrophage infiltration peaks at 2 days after ischemia/reperfusion injury in rodents (19), and this event is dependent on the
expression of adhesion molecules by endothelial cells (51).
TNF-␣ is a potent inducer of adhesion molecules (18, 43); thus
it is possible that the prolonged inhibition reduced the levels of
adhesion molecules, consequently reducing leukocyte infiltration and exacerbating the damage. However, our data do not
support this possibility. The number of CD68⫹ cells, a marker
of macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils, in the ischemic
core and peri-infarct area was not different between SHRSP
treated with ETN or PBS. This suggests that there is an effect
of ETN directly in the postischemic neurons or brain resident
immune cells, such as microglia.
The effects of TNF-␣ and its inhibition on the outcome of
cerebral ischemia are controversial. Some studies show that
acute TNF-␣ generation is involved in neuronal death and
infarct development following MCAO in SHR (1) and that
TNF-␣ inhibition reduces infarct development after cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion (45). In addition, TNF-␣ increases bloodbrain-barrier permeability in the early hours following isch-

emia/reperfusion, increasing secondary ischemic damage (49).
However, others show that knock-out of TNF-␣ receptors
increases damage after MCAO (4, 13). It seems that TNF-␣ has
a dual role in the evolution of the infarct following cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury: on the one hand TNF-␣ induces
neuronal apoptosis (32), thus leading to increased neuronal
death and larger infarcts; conversely, TNF-␣ stimulates acti-

vation of microglia/macrophages (4), which are important for
neuronal survival in the early stages following ischemia, particularly alternatively polarized microglia (17). Our data show
that the number of Iba-1⫹ microglia/macrophages is reduced
in the infarct core of SHRSP ⫹ ETN, suggesting that the innate
cerebral immune response was impaired in those rats. Microglia are also important for eliminating cytotoxic molecules

generated after cell death in the ischemic hemisphere (42). A
reduction in the number of Iba-1⫹ microglia could lead to an
accumulation of cytotoxic molecules, increasing cell death and
expansion of the infarct core. In addition, there seems to be an
upregulation of mRNA for markers of classical microglia/
macrophage activation (M1), such as iNOS and CCR2, without
changes in markers for M2 polarization. M1 polarization was
shown to exacerbate ischemic damage, leading to increased
cell death (16). Thus, it is possible that the chronic ETN
treatment primed macrophage/microglia towards a M1 phenotype, exacerbating ischemic neuronal death and leading to
larger infarcts.
Finally, the lack of a protective effect of ETN in the outcome
of pMCAO could be explained by survival bias. We observed
a 45% mortality (5 out of 11) in SHRSP treated with PBS,
whereas in the SHRSP ⫹ ETN group there was no mortality.
It is possible that the rats treated with vehicle that survived for
24 h had smaller infarcts; and the rats with larger infarcts did
not survive until the time point established for euthanasia and
analysis of infarct size. Because we did not evaluate infarct
size in the rats that died before 24 h post-pMCAO, we might
have skewed our results towards smaller infarcts in vehicletreated SHRSP subjected to pMCAO.
Chronic ETN treatment attenuated hypertrophic remodeling
of MRA in SHRSP. This finding is at odds with our previous
report showing that macrophage depletion did not alter MRA
remodeling in SHRSP (35). Macrophage depletion in SHRSP
caused an increase in TNF-␣ mRNA expression in perivascular
adipose tissue, suggesting that these cells might produce

TNF-␣, which appears to be an important mediator of hypertensive remodeling in the mesenteric vasculature. The findings
in this study support that hypothesis, since ETN improved
MRA structure in the SHRSP. Interestingly, MRA showed an
improvement in mechanical properties, including reduced stiffness and increased distensibility, which was not observed in
the MCA. TNF-␣ was shown to increase collagen deposition in
the rodent heart (22); thus it is possible that ETN decreased

collagen deposition in the MRA, increasing distensibility and
reducing stiffness. Moreover, TNF-␣ was shown to increase
expression and activity of matrix metalloproteases-2 and -9 in
cultured human aortic smooth muscle cells (23). We (36) and
others (6) have shown that matrix metalloproteases are important mediators of hypertensive artery remodeling. It is possible
that TNF-␣ acts upstream of matrix metalloproteases, inducing
their expression and activity, thus worsening remodeling in the
peripheral vasculature.
In summary, we show that TNF-␣ inhibition with ETN
improves the structure of resistance arteries in both the
cerebral and mesenteric vasculature in chronic hypertension.
Despite the improvement in cerebral vascular structure,
infarct size following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury
was larger in SHRSP ⫹ ETN. This effect seems to be a
consequence of reduced microglia in the ischemic core after
tMCAO, coupled to an increase in M1 polarization, which
could lead to exacerbation in neuronal ischemic death.
Limitations of the study. The present study has a few
limitations and caveats that need to be mentioned. First, we
did not perform quantitative measurements of cerebral blood
flow. The scanning laser Doppler flowmetry measures perfusion in arbitrary units (perfusion units), although the
calibration of the laser detector is not changed between
subjects. Therefore, it still allows for comparative analyses
between experimental groups. The laser has a penetration
depth of ⬃1 mm into the tissue. The skull of a 12-wk-old
SHRSP is no thicker than 0.5 mm; thus the equipment
measures perfusion in surface pial circulation and the outermost layer of the underlying cerebral cortex (36). Second,
all perfusion measurements were performed with the rat
under deep general anesthesia induced by 3% isoflurane in
pure oxygen. Isoflurane is a known dilator of cerebral
arteries (47), and the increase in basal pial perfusion could

be linked to the increased lumen diameter of fully dilated
cerebral arteries and arterioles. Regarding the MCAO surgical procedure, the rats were not mechanically ventilated,
which could impact cerebral perfusion. Combined with the
effects of isoflurane, the increased infarct in ETN-treated
SHRSP could have been caused by a reduction in cerebral
blood flow that was below the detection limits of the
technology used in the present study. However, we propose
that a shift in macrophage/microglia polarization rather than
alterations in cerebral perfusion is responsible for the effects
of ETN on the outcome of cerebral ischemia. Finally, the
conclusions of this work are supported by associative evidence rather than direct links. Due to the terminal nature of
the measurements performed, it is difficult to elucidate
direct cause-and-effect links between the treatment and
end-points measured.
