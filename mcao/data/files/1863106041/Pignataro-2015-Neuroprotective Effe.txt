ABSTRACT: We investigated the eﬀect of the VEGF-mimetic peptide, QK, on ischemic brain
damage and on blood−brain barrier permeability in the rat. QK administered by the
intracerebroventricular, intravenous, or intranasal route caused a 40% decrease in ischemic
brain damage induced by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery relative to that in
controls. No increase in the volume of the ischemic hemisphere compared to that of the
contralateral nonischemic hemisphere was observed in rats treated with QK, suggesting that
this peptide did not cause brain edema. The eﬀect of QK on vessel permeability was evaluated
by intravital pial microvessel videoimaging, a technique that allows the pial vessels to be
visualized through a surgically prepared open cranial window. The results showed that QK did
not cause any leakage of intravenously injected ﬂuorescein−dextran conjugates after
intracarotid administration or topical application to the brain cortex. Collectively, these data
suggest that QK may exert neuroprotective activity in the context of stroke without promoting
any increase in vascular permeability. Because VEGF’s neuroprotective activity may be
overshadowed by the appearance of brain edema and microbleeds, QK could represent a signiﬁcant step forward in stroke
treatment.

leaky17 and acutely increases the permeability of preexisting
blood vessels, causing the loosening of endothelial cell junctions
and the formation of fenestrations.18−22 Because of these eﬀects
on vascular permeability, VEGF caused brain edema and
microbleeds and ultimately worsened tissue damage in animal
models of stroke.23,24 Therefore, the development of this growth
factor as a therapeutic tool in brain ischemia appears to be
problematic.
New VEGF-like peptides with proangiogenic activity have
been recently synthesized. They are considered to be a promising
alternative to VEGF for clinical applications such as wound repair
and ulcer healing because of their less expensive and easier
synthesis.25,26 It is still unclear, however, whether these VEGFmimetic peptides could also represent an improvement over
VEGF for stroke therapy. In particular, it has not yet been
established whether they have neuroprotective activity in the
context of stroke and whether they promote blood−brain barrier
(BBB) permeabilization like VEGF. In the present article, we
explored this issue using one of the most interesting members of
this new family of VEGF-mimetic peptides, the QK peptide that

EGF has long been considered a promising drug candidate
for stroke therapy because of its neuroregenerative and
neuroprotective properties.1 Indeed, after a stroke, the synthesis
and release of VEGF are induced in the brain,2 and this growth
factor orchestrates a reparative cascade that aims to restore blood
perfusion through new blood vessels and to repopulate the
injured brain with new neuronal, glial, and endothelial cells.3,4
Speciﬁcally, VEGF activates the neurovascular niche, a highly
specialized unit composed of mutually interacting neuroblasts
and newly formed endothelial cells and glial cells.1,5−7 Moreover,
VEGF exerts signiﬁcant neuroprotective activity in in vitro
models of ischemic neuronal cell death8 and excitotoxicity.9,10
This suggests that, after stroke, VEGF not only promotes
regeneration but also rescues neurons in the ischemic
penumbra,11 the brain region that surrounds the ischemic core
and that dies hours or days after vessel occlusion because of the
impairment of intracellular ion homeostasis.12−14
Despite this strong rationale, the use of VEGF in experimental
brain ischemia has yielded controversial and generally disappointing results. It has become clear that the increase in
vascular permeability induced by this growth factor may
overshadow its neuroprotective eﬀects.15,16 VEGF induces,
indeed, the formation of blood vessels that are immature and

was originally synthesized in our laboratories.27 QK reproduces,
in a stable form, the helix conformation of VEGF residues 17−25,
which represents one of the regions of this growth factor that take
part in the recognition of VEGF receptors.28,29 This peptide,
which is remarkably stable in serum,30 activates VEGF
receptors27 and induces angiogenesis both in vitro30 and in
vivo.31,32 In addition, QK decreases neuronal cell damage in
diﬀerent experimental models of peripheral neuropathy,
suggesting that it could also have neuroprotective activity.33
Here, we show that, in rats, QK administered either by the
intracerebroventricular (icv), intravenous (iv), or intranasal
route reduced brain damage in experimental brain ischemia
induced by the permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery
(pMCAO). Unlike VEGF, QK did not promote BBB
permeabilization, as evaluated by intravital pial microvessel
videoimaging.

whether QK may cross the BBB. To this end, we used intravital
pial microvessel videoimaging, a technique based on the
visualization of pial microvessels through a window drilled in
the skull. Speciﬁcally, we looked for the appearance of
ﬂuorescence in brain vessels and parenchyma after the injection
of ﬂuorescein-conjugated QK (50 μg/kg, in three consecutive
boluses, n = 4) into the internal carotid artery. The results
showed the appearance of bright ﬂuorescence ﬁrst in the
arteriolar and then in the venular compartment (Figure 2A−C).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
QK Decreases pMCAO-Induced Ischemic Brain Damage. To establish whether QK has neuroprotective properties in
brain ischemia induced by pMCAO, we ﬁrst evaluated its eﬀect
after icv administration because this route enables direct drug
delivery into the brain. As detailed in the Methods, peptide
administration began at the time that the QK-containing osmotic
minipump was implanted (releasing 3 μg/mL QK at a rate of 1
μL/h), 30 min before the induction of brain ischemia. The
percent of ischemic brain damage evaluated 3 days after pMCAO
was signiﬁcantly lower in rats icv-injected with QK (n = 7) as
compared with that in control animals that received normal
saline by the same route of administration (Figure 1A). These

Figure 2. Time course of pial vessel visualization after intracarotid
injection of ﬂuorescein-conjugated QK. The four panels show images of
the pial circulation visualized through a transcranial window that were
taken before (A) and 20 s (B), 28 s (C), and 40 s (D) after the
intracarotid injection of QK (120 μg/kg in three consecutive boluses) in
an anesthetized rat representative of a group of 4. Note the rapid
appearance of bright ﬂuorescence in the arteriolar compartment (B) and
the later visualization of the venular compartment in panel C. The image
in panel D shows that diﬀuse ﬂuorescence can be observed in the brain
parenchyma even when ﬂuorescence is no longer apparent in the vessel
lumina. This suggested that some ﬂuorescent QK crossed the vessel wall
and entered the brain.

Thereafter, ﬂuorescent QK adhered to the vessel wall and
extravasated in the brain parenchyma, as shown by the
progressive increase in interstitial ﬂuorescence on the venular
side up to values 10-fold higher than baseline by 3 ± 1 min after
injection (NGL values: 0.21 ± 0.04 vs 0.02 ± 0.01, p < 0.01)
(Figures 2D and 3). Similar results were obtained after iv
injection of ﬂuorescent QK, although, as expected, higher doses
were needed and ﬂuorescence was fainter than that after
intracarotid injection (Figure 4). These data indicated that QK
may cross the BBB and reach the brain parenchyma.
To establish whether intravenous QK could exert neuroprotective activity in the context of stroke once it enters the brain,
we compared the ischemic brain damage induced by pMCAO in
seven diﬀerent groups of rats that were injected 1 h after pMCAO
either with this peptide at doses of 1.2, 12, 40, 120, 360, and 1200
μg/kg or with its vehicle. Ischemic damage measured 3 days after
pMCAO was signiﬁcantly lower in rats receiving 40 or 120 μg/kg
QK (n = 5 and 6, respectively) than in those injected with vehicle
(n = 5) or lower QK doses. Interestingly, no neuroprotection was
observed in rats receiving the higher doses of 360 and 1200 μg/
kg (Figure 5A). Similar to observations with icv-administered
QK, iv-administered QK did not increase the percent ratio of the
volumes of the ischemic and contralateral hemispheres, which
was close to 100% in treated animals and controls (Figure 5B).
This suggested that iv QK did not induce brain edema.

results showed that icv-injected QK elicits neuroprotection in the
context of stroke. The percent ratio of the volumes of the
ischemic and contralateral hemispheres was close to 100% in
both QK- and vehicle-injected rats, suggesting that QK did not
promote brain edema (Figure 1B).
The icv route is highly invasive and, hence, not amenable for
possible clinical development. Therefore, we investigated
whether QK was still eﬀective when given by the less invasive
iv route. Preliminary experiments were performed to assess

microscopic ﬁeld reproduced in Figure 2, taken at a shortened time interval to illustrate in more detail the kinetics of QK extravasation into the brain
parenchyma. The time elapsed is based on the appearance of ﬂuorescence in the arteriole indicated by the arrows. Although QK ﬂuorescence was no
longer appreciable in the lumen of the arteriole by 1 s from the time of its initial visualization, the ﬂuorescence gradually diﬀused into the surrounding
brain parenchyma over the following 5 s.

QK May Be Administered Intranasally To Elicit Neuroprotection in Stroke. During a stroke, a short delay between
the beginning of symptoms and the institution of treatment is
essential to rescue the ischemic brain from death. Therefore,
great eﬀorts are currently directed to develop modalities of drug
administration that could help to institute pharmacological
treatment even before the patient is admitted to the stroke unit.
An interesting possibility to achieve this goal is to give
neuroprotective drugs by the intranasal route. Drugs administered by this route gain direct access to the brain, bypassing the
BBB because they diﬀuse along the olfactory and trigeminal
ﬁbers34,35 and spreading to very far regions, including those that
are more severely damaged in stroke, such as the cortex and
striatum. Intranasal administration is considered to be a
promising strategy to deliver growth factors such as IGF-1,
erythropoietin, NGF, TGF-β, and VEGF to the brain for the
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.35−43 Therefore, we
investigated whether QK-induced neuroprotection was still
observed when this peptide was given intranasally. We ﬁrst
examined whether intranasally administered QK could gain
access to the brain. To this end, we instilled a ﬂuorescein-QK
conjugate into the nostrils of nonischemic rats and looked for the
appearance of ﬂuorescence in diﬀerent brain regions 3 h
thereafter. Confocal microscopy experiments showed bright
ﬂuorescence in the cerebellar cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and
olfactory bulbs, whereas the signal was faint in the cerebral cortex
(Figure 6). These results suggested that QK diﬀused into the
brain after intranasal administration. The strong ﬂuorescence
that we observed in the olfactory bulbs and cerebellum was not
unexpected because similar results have been reported with other
ﬂuorescent peptides and with living cells given by the intranasal
route. The preferential distribution of intranasally administered
compounds to these brain regions could be explained by their
diﬀusion along the olfactory and trigeminal neural pathways.44
To establish whether intranasal QK exerted a neuroprotective
eﬀect in the context of stroke, we instilled QK (12 μg/kg in 5
aliquots of 10 μL given alternatively in the two nostrils in a single
session, n = 7) or its vehicle (n = 7) in the nostrils of pMCAO-

A signiﬁcant improvement in general neurological scores was
observed in rats receiving 120 μg/kg QK and in focal scores in
those treated with 40, 120, or 360 μg/kg QK (Figure 5C,D).
Collectively, these data provided a proof of concept that the
small VEGF-mimetic peptide, QK, may exert a neuroprotective
eﬀect in the context of stroke.

signal in the cerebellum, the moderate intensity of staining in the striatum and hippocampus CA3 subﬁeld, and the weak ﬂuorescence in the cortex. Note
also that ﬂuorescent QK decorates the surface of neurons in high-magniﬁcation images, suggesting a speciﬁc interaction of QK with plasmamembrane
receptors.

like iv- or icv-administered QK, intranasally administered QK did
not induce the formation of brain edema (Figure 7B).
QK Does Not Increase BBB Permeability. To investigate
whether QK, like VEGF, may increase BBB permeability, we
studied its eﬀect on brain microvessels by intravital pial
microvessel videoimaging. More speciﬁcally, we evaluated
whether QK promoted the extravasation of ﬂuorescent dextran
into the brain parenchyma, a high-molecular-weight compound
that does not cross the BBB under physiological conditions.
Fluorescent dextran was injected through an indwelling femoral
catheter, and parenchymal brain ﬂuorescence beneath the cranial
window was measured before and after the injection of either
VEGF (28−84 μg/kg) or QK (1.2−220 μg/kg) in three
consecutive boluses through the carotid artery. At all of the
doses tested, parenchymal ﬂuorescencence increased strongly
after VEGF and only marginally after QK injection (Figure 8).
Similar results were obtained when QK (three consecutive 1 μg
doses in 1 mL instillations) or VEGF in equimolar amounts was
topically applied onto the denuded meningeal surface in the
bottom of the craniotomy window (n = 4 in both groups).
Indeed, a signiﬁcant leakage of ﬂuorescent dextran into the brain
parenchyma was observed when VEGF was locally instilled
(NGL: 0.12 ± 0.03 vs 0.04 ± 0.02, p < 0.01), whereas a similar
application QK did not cause any eﬀect on vessel permeability, as
indicated by the fairly stable NGL values (NGL: 0.05 ± 0.03 vs
0.04 ± 0.02, ns) (Figure 9). These data showed that, unlike
VEGF, QK does not permeabilize pial vessels. Therefore, QK
could represent an important therapeutic advancement for use in
stroke compared to VEGF, which, at equimolar concentrations,
promotes BBB permeabilization and hence the formation of
brain edema.16,47
It is unclear why QK retained the neuroprotective activity of
VEGF while losing the ability to promote the permeabilization of
the BBB. It should be considered, however, that a dissociation
between neuroprotective and vessel permeabilizing eﬀects was
also observed with VEGF-E, a VEGF form produced by Orf
viruses, which was explained as being a consequence of this
growth factor not binding to VEGFR-1.48 Some evidence has
been reported, indeed, that VEGFR-1 takes part in vascular
permeabilization,49 although this eﬀect is probably exerted in
concert with VEGFR-2, which also controls vessel permeability.1,50 However, in contrast to VEGF-E, QK potently
activates not only VEGFR-2 but also VEGFR-1 in vitro.27 An
alternative hypothesis that could account for our ﬁndings relies
on the evidence that although VEGFR-2 receptor activation is
responsible for VEGF’s angiogenic, neuroprotective, and
permeabilizing eﬀects,1,49 the transduction mechanisms involved
diverge to some degree. Speciﬁcally, while Akt and MAPK
activation are essential for neuroprotection and angiogenesis,1,50
vascular permeabilization is dependent on src51,52 and rac
activation,53 PKD1-mediated Syx phosphorylation,22 and NOS
activation.52,54 Experimental evidence has been reported that
these diﬀerent angiogenic and vascular permeability pathways
can be independently modulated. For instance, in cultured
human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), VEGFinduced angiogenesis is suppressed, whereas vascular permeabilization is enhanced when protein kinase C is inhibited.55
Moreover, in porcine aortic endothelial cells stably expressing
VEGFR-2, the PI3-K inhibitor, wortmannin, suppresses VEGFinduced rac activation with a much higher potency than ERK
activation.53 Importantly, structurally diﬀerent VEGFR agonists
may diﬀerentially aﬀect the various VEGFR-2 transduction
pathways, as reported in skin vessels, where VEGF121 and

induced rats 3 h after surgery. The ischemic damage evaluated 3
days after pMCAO was approximately 40% lower in rats
receiving intranasal QK than that in controls (n = 7) (Figure

of rats sacriﬁced 7 days after QK (n = 7) intranasal administration
compared to that of vehicle-treated controls (n = 7), suggesting
that the eﬀect of intranasally administering a single dose of QK
persisted for at least a week (Figure 7A), a time point that was
chosen because previous studies suggested that brain ischemic
lesions become stable after this time and do not further
progress.45,46 Interestingly, intranasal QK was eﬀective at a
dosage 10 times lower than the intravenous neuroprotective
dose. This result could be explained by the fact that intranasally
administered drugs bypass systemic distribution and clearance
and thus reach higher concentrations in the brain than do
comparable doses given intravenously.
In control and QK-treated rats sacriﬁced 3 or 7 days after
pMCAO, the percent ratio of the volumes of the ischemic and
contralateral hemispheres ranged around 100%, suggesting that,

carboxamido]hexanoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) was coupled
on solid phase to the peptidyl-resin after selective deprotection of this
methyl-trytil group. QK and its ﬂuorescent derivative were cleaved from
the resin with triﬂuoracetic acid, triisopropyl silane, and water
(95:2.5:2.5) at room temperature for 3 h. Purity and identity of the
peptides were assessed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
Experimental Animals. All experiments were performed in male
Sprague−Dawley rats weighing 250−270 g (Charles River, Calco, Italy).
Rats were group caged on a 12 h light/dark cycle and had free access to
food and water. The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal
Care Committee of “Federico II”, University of Naples, Italy (CESA,
Comitato Etico-Scientiﬁco per la Sperimentazione Animale c/o Centro
Servizi Veterinari). Animal housing and experimental procedures were
performed according to the recommendations of the guidelines for the
care and use of experimental animals of the European Community
Council directive (86/609/EEC). All eﬀorts were made to minimize
animal suﬀering and to reduce the number of animals used in the
experiments.
Design of the Study. We used two diﬀerent experimental
approaches to assess QK’s neuroprotective and vascular permeabilizing
eﬀects. To address the ﬁrst point, experimental brain ischemia was
induced by pMCAO, and QK was administered at diﬀerent doses by
diﬀerent administration routes, as detailed below. The eﬀect of the
peptide on vessel permeability was evaluated by intravital pial
microvessel videoimaging. The details of these techniques are reported
below. In all experiments, simple randomization was used to allocate
animals to the control or diﬀerent intervention groups. All experiments
were performed in a blinded manner, with diﬀerent researchers
performing drug administration or brain ischemia and analysis of
behavioral/morphological data.
Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (pMCAO).
pMCAO was performed as previously described.58 Brieﬂy, rats were
deeply anesthetized with a gas mixture (4% sevoﬂurane in a 70% nitrous
oxide/30% oxygen) delivered through a nose cone. Anesthesia was
maintained with 2% sevoﬂurane. Under an operating stereomicroscope
(Nikon SMZ800, Nikon Instruments, Florence, Italy), a 2 cm incision
was made vertically between the orbit and the ear. The left lateral aspect
of the skull was exposed by reﬂecting the temporal muscle, and a small
window (diameter = 2 mm) was opened in the area corresponding to
middle cerebral artery (MCA). Then, the MCA was permanently
occluded as close as possible to its origin with a bipolar electrocauterizer
(Diatermo MB122; G.I.M.A., Milan, Italy). Saline solution was applied
during this procedure to prevent heat injury. Cortical cerebral blood
ﬂow was monitored with a laser-Doppler ﬂowmeter (Periﬂux system
5000, Perimed, Milan, Italy) during the entire pMCAO procedure and

the brain parenchyma in the VEGF, but not in the QK, injected rat. This
suggests that VEGF, but not QK, increases vascular permeability in the
brain.

VEGF165 diﬀerentially activate src and the MAPK cascade.56
Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that QK, which reproduces
only part of the VEGF regions involved in receptor binding or
regulation,57 could selectively activate the neuroprotection
transduction cascade and not the pathway responsible for
vascular permeability.
In conclusion, we provided evidence that the VEGF-like
peptide, QK, has neuroprotective activity in a rat model of stroke
and that this eﬀect occurs in the absence of vessel permeabilizing
eﬀects. Therefore, QK could be a promising alternative to VEGF
for neuroprotection in stroke, which is further supported by its
eﬀectiveness when given not only by the icv route but also
through minimally invasive administration routes, such as
intranasally.

METHODS

Synthesis of QK and Its Fluorescein Conjugate. QK (acetylKLTWQELYQLKYKGI-amide) was synthesized as previously reported.27 Brieﬂy, the synthesis was carried out on solid phase by
standard Fmoc (N-(9-ﬂuorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry using a
Rink Amide MBHA resin (Novabiochem, Billerica, MA, USA). The side
chain of the N-terminal lysine was protected with a methyl-trytil group.

removed, placed in ice-cold saline solution for 5 min, cut into 500 μM
coronal slices with a Campden vibratome (Campden Instrument,
752M; UK), and stained with 2% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC).
In all slices between +4.7 and −4.9 mm from bregma according to the
Paxinos atlas, the infarcted region was identiﬁed as the white area after
TTC staining and was measured with the image analysis software ImagePro Plus (Image Pro Plus 4.1, Media Cybernetic, Rockville, MD, USA).
The values obtained were used to calculate the volumes of each
hemisphere and of the infarcted area, as detailed elsewhere.61
Confocal Immunoﬂuorescence. Three hours after the intranasal
administration of the ﬂuorescein−QK conjugate (50 μL of a 75 μg/mL,
i.e., approximately 300 μM, solution, given in ﬁve consecutive 10 μL
administrations alternatively in each nostril), rats were deeply
anesthetized with chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg ip) and transcardially
perfused with 4% w/v paraformaldehyde in phosphate buﬀer. Coronal
sections (60 μM tick) of the ﬁxed brains were obtained with a cryostat
(Microm HM 560, Thermo Scientiﬁc, France). Confocal analysis was
performed as described elsewhere62 using a Zeiss LSM510 META/laser
scanning confocal microscope. Single images were taken with an optical
thickness of 0.7 μm and a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels.
Intravital Pial Microvessel Videoimaging. The eﬀect of QK on
pial brain microvessels was evaluated by intravital videomicroscopy, a
method based on the visualization of pial vessels with a ﬂuorescence
microscope through a surgically prepared open cranial window.63
Brieﬂy, after inducing a deep anesthetization with α-chloralose (50 mg/
kg of body weight, intraperitoneally) plus urethane (600 mg/kg of body
weight, intraperitoneally), rats were tracheotomized and mechanically
ventilated. Anesthesia was maintained with urethane alone (100 mg/kg
of body weight, iv every hour). Both of the femoral arteries were
catheterized: the left for blood pressure measurement and the right for
the injection of ﬂuorescent tracers. A cranial window (4 mm × 5 mm)
was drilled in the parietal bone (posterior, 1.5 mm to bregma; lateral, 3
mm to the midline), and the dura mater on its bottom was gently
removed to expose pial microvessels. The anesthetized animal was then
secured on the stage of a Leitz Orthoplan ﬂuorescence microscope. A
perfusion system was positioned into the cranial window to
continuously superfuse the exposed brain surface with artiﬁcial
cerebrospinal ﬂuid heated at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C (119.0 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM
KCl, 1.3 mM MgSO4·7H2O, 1.0 mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 2.5
mM CaCl2, and 11.0 mM glucose, equilibrated with 10.0% O2, 6.0%
CO2, and 84.0% N2; pH 7.38 ± 0.02). To visualize brain microvessels,
dextran-bound ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (molecular weight 70 kDa)
was injected through the right femoral artery (50 mg/100 g b.w., i.v. as 5
wt %/vol solution). Images were continuously acquired before and after
QK or VEGF administration using a DAGE MTI 300RC low-light level
digital camera connected to the microscope and recorded by a
computer-based frame grabber (Pinnacle DC 10 plus, Avid Technology,
MA, USA). Image analysis was performed oﬄine using the MIP Image
software system (CNR Institute of Clinical Physiology, Pisa, Italy). The
eﬀect of QK and VEGF on vessel permeability was evaluated by
measuring the changes in extravascular ﬂuorescence caused by the
leakage of ﬂuorescent dextran. The data were expressed as normalized
gray levels (NGL), i.e., as the ratio between the averages of the gray
levels measured in ﬁve diﬀerent windows before and after QK or VEGF
administration (NGL = (I − Ir)/Ir, where Ir is the average baseline gray
level at the end of vessel ﬁlling with ﬂuorescence and I is the same
parameter at the end of QK or VEGF administration).
Statistical Analysis. Data were analyzed using Sigma Stat 3.5
software (Systat, San Jose, CA, USA), setting the threshold for statistical
signiﬁcance at p < 0.05. The Shapiro−Wilk test was used to assess
whether data were normally distributed. Statistical comparisons of
normally distributed data were performed with ANOVA followed by the
Bonferroni posthoc test to correct for familywise errors. The signiﬁcance
of diﬀerences in general and focal neurological deﬁcit scores was
assessed with Kruskal−Wallis nonparametric ANOVA followed by
Dunn’s posthoc test.

30 min thereafter. Rats in which cerebral blood ﬂow did not drop below
the threshold value of 70% of baseline after pMCAO were excluded from
the study. During the entire surgical intervention, body temperature was
maintained at 37.5 ± 0.5 °C with a thermostatic blanket (Homeothermic Blanket System, Harvard Apparatus, London, UK). Arterial
blood gases were measured before and after ischemia through a catheter
inserted into the femoral artery (Rapid lab 860; Chiron Diagnostic,
Emeryville, CA, USA), and no diﬀerences were observed among the
diﬀerent experimental groups (data not shown).
Rats undergoing pMCAO were enrolled in the following
experimental groups:
(1) QK icv administration, pMCAO, sacriﬁce 3 days after surgery.
Eighteen rats were randomized for the icv administration of
either QK (n = 8) or its vehicle (n = 10). One animal was
excluded from the control group because laser-Doppler
ﬂowmetry showed an insuﬃcient drop in cerebral blood ﬂow,
whereas one rat from the QK group died before the time
scheduled for sacriﬁce.
(2) QK iv administration, pMCAO, sacriﬁce 3 days after surgery.
Thirty nine rats were randomized in four groups to receive either
QK (1.2, 12, and 120 μg/kg, n = 11, 9, and 10, respectively) or its
vehicle (n = 9) intravenously 1 h after pMCAO. Nine rats (three
in the 120 μg/kg QK group and two in each of the other groups)
were excluded from the experiment because of an insuﬃcient
decrease in cerebral blood ﬂow determined by laser-Doppler
ﬂowmetry. Among the remaining 30 animals, eight died because
of brain ischemia before the end of the experiment (two from the
control group and three, two, and one from the groups receiving
1.2, 12, and 120 μg/kg QK, respectively). Therefore, ﬁve rats in
the control group and six, ﬁve, and six in the 1.2, 12, and 120 μg/
kg QK groups, respectively, completed the study.
(3) QK intranasal administration, pMCAO, sacriﬁce 3 days after
surgery. Fourteen rats were randomized in two groups to receive
either intranasal QK (12 μg/kg) or vehicle 3 h after vessel
occlusion. All of these animals completed the study because no
insuﬃcient blood ﬂow drop by ﬂowmetry or premature death
was observed in either group.
(4) QK intranasal administration, pMCAO, sacriﬁce 7 days after
surgery. As in group 3, 14 animals were randomized in two
groups to receive intranasally either QK (n = 7) or vehicle (n =
7). All of the animals enrolled completed the study.
QK Administration. QK was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl as a 60 μg/mL
(corresponding to about 300 μM) stock solution and stored at −80 °C
in aliquots for later use.
The icv administration was performed through an implanted Alzet
osmotic minipump (Durect, Cupertino, CA) as described elsewhere.59
Pumps containing either QK (3 μg/mL, 1 μL/h) or vehicle were
implanted 30 min before pMCAO, and QK administration began
virtually at the time of pump implantation.
For iv administration, QK was injected in awake rats through the
lateral tail vein after dipping the tail in warm water for about 1 min to
dilate the vessels.
For intranasal administration, a total volume of 50 μL of the 60 μg/
mL QK solution, corresponding to about 3 μg for a 250 g rat (12 μg/kg),
was instilled in the nasal cavities of awake rats as 10 μL aliquots
introduced through a pipet tip alternatively in each of the nostrils with a
2 min interval between each administration.
Evaluation of Neurological Deﬁcits. General and focal neurological deﬁcits were evaluated according to Clark’s scale.60 Brieﬂy, this
grading scale assigns a numerical score to speciﬁc general (hair ruﬄing,
position of ears, eye conditions, abnormal posture, decrease in
spontaneous locomotor activity, occurrence of seizures) and focal
(gait, body symmetry, climbing, turning behavior, front leg extension,
compulsory circling, sensory response) neurological signs. The scores
obtained for each of these signs are then added to calculate total general
and focal neurological scores.
Evaluation of Ischemic Damage. The volume of the ischemic
lesion was assessed 3 or 7 days after pMCAO, as described elsewhere.61
Brieﬂy, rats were sacriﬁced by decapitation. Brains were quickly
