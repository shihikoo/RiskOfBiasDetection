Objective: The restoration of blood ﬂow to the brain after ischemic stroke prevents further, extensive damage but can result in reperfusion injury. The inﬂammation response is one of many factors
involved in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury. This study investigated the use of vinpocetine, a drug
used to treat cognitive impairment, to explore its effects on inﬂammation in a rat model of cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion.
Methods: Wistar rats were randomly assigned to a control group, (n = 40) a cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
group (n = 52) and a vinpocetine cerebral ischemia–reperfusion group (n = 52). A model of middle cerebral
artery occlusion was induced for 2 h followed by reperfusion and the infarct size was determined by
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining 6 h, 24 h, 3 days, and 7 days after reperfusion. The
dry–wet weight method was used to measure brain water content and evaluate the extent of brain
edema. Immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization were used to detect the expression of NF-␬B
and TNF-␣.
Results: The NF-␬B levels in ischemic brain tissue increased 6 h after reperfusion and the TNF-␣ levels
increased at 24 h, both reached their peaks at day 3 then decreased gradually, but remained above the
controls at day 7. Vinpocetine decreased the levels of NF-␬B and TNF-␣ 24 h and 3 days after reperfusion.
Conclusion: NF-␬B and TNF-␣ is associated with changes in brain edema and infarct volume. Vinpocetine
decreases the expression of NF-␬B and TNF-␣ and inhibits the inﬂammatory response after cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion.

Introduction
During the treatment of stroke the restoration of blood to the
ischemic brain is vital in preventing further damage. Unfortunately
in some cases this reperfusion can cause further problems. Cerebral

ischemia–reperfusion injury is caused by many processes such
as oxidative stress, inﬂammation and apoptosis [8]. Among these
mechanisms the inﬂammatory response is a critical factor. In
[8] progression of the inﬂammation after ischemia–reperfusion
injury, inﬂammatory cytokines activate nuclear transcription
factor ␬B (NF␬B) through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). NF␬B signal
transduction pathways promote target gene activation and induce
neuronal apoptosis, and even necrosis, ultimately aggravating the
cerebral disease [2,4].

NF-␬B is implicated in the ampliﬁcation and continuation (cascade effect) of the inﬂammatory response [3]. Cytoplasmic NF-␬B
is in a complex with the inhibitor protein(I␬B␣).Activated NF-␬B is
translocated into the nucleus where it binds to speciﬁc sequences
of DNA called response elements (RE) [7,21]. The DNA/NF-␬B complex then recruits other proteins such as coactivators and RNA
polymerase for mRNA transcription. NF-␬B can efﬁciently induce
varieties of cell factors such as cytokines and chemokines, which
in turn activates further NF-␬B expression. These all sustain and
amplify the inﬂammatory response [17].
Vinpocetine was developed as a prospective treatment for cerebrovascular disorders and cognitive impairment [20]. Its main
pathways involve [12]: (1) it restrains brain phosphodiesterase
activity, diastolic vascular smooth muscle, increases the brain
blood supply; (2) it improves brain metabolism, by promoting utilization of glucose and synthesis of adenosine triphosphate; (3)
it is effective in reducing blood viscosity and inhibiting platelet
gathering [10,12]. Current areas of neurological research include
nerve protection and improvement of cognitive impairment by
inhibition of the inﬂammatory pathway [1,15,16,19,20]. So vinpocetine may have huge potential for multiple uses in the treatment
of neurological diseases [14]. Studies suggest that vinpocetine
has an inhibitory phosphodiesterase activity, which regulates the
cAMP/cGMP ratio, thus it may have a role in regulating the inﬂammatory response [9,10].
In prior work, many studies have chosen in vitro cultured
cells to determine the molecular targets and their association
with pro-inﬂammatory pathways such as NF-␬B and TNF-␣. In
the current study, we have shown the time-dependent expression
of NF-␬B and TNF-␣, enchaledema and cerebral infarct volumes
in a rat model of ischemia–reperfusion injury. Importantly we
demonstrate the ability of vinpocetine to suppress these inﬂammatory pathways, suggesting the therapeutic use of this agent in
ischemia–reperfusion injury.
Materials and methods
Animals
144 healthy Wistar male rats 220–250 g in weight, were provided by the Tianjin Medical University laboratory animal centre.
The rats were randomly divided into three groups, the control
group (n = 40), the ischemia reperfusion group (model group, n = 52)
and the vinpocetine treated group (vinpocetine group, n = 52). For
each group, ﬁve rats were sacriﬁced at 6 h, 24 h, 3 days and 7
days to measure brain water content, another ﬁve were sacriﬁced for immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of NF-␬B
and TNF-␣ and in-situ hybridization of TNF-␣. For the vinpocetine
group and the model group, the volume of cerebral infarction was
measured by the TTC staining technique at each time point (n = 3).
The model of cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury
The middle cerebral artery was occluded according to the Longa
method. One end of nylon wire (diameter of 0.24 mm) was ﬁred
smooth and polished into the same size. All rats were anesthetized
by intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (10%, 3 ml/kg). The
neck’s skin was cut to expose the common carotid artery on the
right side, the external carotid artery branch and the pterygopalatine artery were ligated. The proximal end of the common carotid
artery was ligated and a small hole was cut at the telecentric end,
the nylon wire was inserted into the internal carotid artery until
the cerebral middle artery (18 ± 0.5 mm). After 2 h the line was
removed to achieve a reperfusion model. A successful model was
judged to be when the rats woke up demonstrating left foreleg

buckling when lifting the tail, climbing in a circle to the left, and
so on. Rats that showed excessive bleeding, dyspnea, subarachnoid
hemorrhage and early death were excluded. For the control group,
rats were ligated without inserting a nylon line. For the vinpocetine
group, vinpocetine [5,6] (10 mg/kg) was given by intraperitoneal
injection 1 h after inserting the nylon wire.
Measurement of brain water content
The water content of the brain tissue were measured by the
dry–wet weight method. Rats were sacriﬁced at each time point
after reperfusion injury. The cerebellum was removed with the
brainstem and diencephalons and the weight of the wet cerebrum was measured. Then the brain was dried at 110 ◦ C for 24 h
in an electrically heated drying oven and the weight of the cerebrum was measured. The following formula was used to evaluate
the water content: water content = (wet weight − dry weight)/wet
weight×100%.
Volume of cerebral infarction
After the rats were sacriﬁced, the cerebrum was removed and
put in a −4 ◦ C refrigerator for 20 min; it was then sliced into ﬁve
uniform coronal sections. The sections were placed in 2% 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma) at 37 ◦ C in a water bath,
then ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The normal brain tissue was
dyed pink while infarction area was pale. The infarction area of
every ﬁve sections was measured by using image analysis software
(Scion Image) and the volume of cerebral infarction was estimated
by cerebral infarction = the infarction area × thickness/2.
Immunohistochemistry of NF-B and TNF-˛
Deeply anesthetized rats were beheaded and the brain was
removed. After ﬁxing in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, 2 mm coronal sections were made from the front of the optic chiasma then
dehydrated and immersed in wax to cut several 4 ␮m slices. The
dewaxed and hydrated slices were then probed with a mouse
monoclonal primary antibody to NF-␬B or TNF-␣ (1:200 dilution,
Santa cruz, USA) and incubated at 4 ◦ C for 12 h. A biotinylated antibody was then incubated at 37 ◦ C for 30 min and the sections were
stained with DAB and restained with hematoxylin. PBS was used as
a negative control. The cells were counted in a random 200 magniﬁcation view, 10 positive views were counted for every slice: 5
positive views were chosen from the brain cortex and the striate
area. The positive cells in a grid were counted 3 times, then the
mean value was calculated.
In-situ hybridization of TNF-˛ in ischemic brain tissue
Slice preparation for in-situ hybridization was as same as for
immunohistochemistry, but the section thickness was 10 ␮m and
all the equipment used was inactivated for RNA-enzymes by highly
compressed steam [13]. The TNF-␣ probe sequences were: (1)
5 -AAAGC ATGAT CCGAG ACGTG GAACT GGCCG AGGAG-3 ; (2) 5 CTGTA CCTCA TCTAC TCCCA GGTCC TCTTC AAGGG-3 ; (3) 5 -GAGTC
TGGGC AGGTC TACTT TGGAG TCATT GCCCT-3 . After incubation
with 3% pepsase every slice was incubated with 20 ␮l of prehybridization solution (formamide 5 ml, 20 × SSC 2.5 ml, dextran
sulfate 1 g, 100 × Denhardt’s 0.5 ml, 10%SDS 0.5 ml, 10 g/l sperm
DNA 0.1 ml, H2 O 1.4 l) at 37 ◦ C for 2 h, then with 20 ␮l hybridization solution containing the TNF-␣ probe at 37 ◦ C overnight. The
slices were immersed serially in 2×, 0.5×, 0.2× SSC for 10 min each
then blocked and then incubated with a biotinylated mouse antidigoxin antibody at 37 ◦ C for 1 h. After washing in PBS, with the

streptavidin–biotin complex (SABC) at 37 ◦ C for 20 min, biotin peroxidase at 37 ◦ C for 20 min they were ﬁnally stained with DAB and
restained with hematoxylin. Prehybridization solution was used as
negative control.
Western blotting for NF-B P65 protein
The following procedures were performed at 4 ◦ C. (1) Cerebral
homogenate was suspended in 100 ␮l buffer A (10 mmol/l HepesNaOH (pH7. 8), 15 mmol/l KCl, 1 mmol/l MgCl2 . 0.1 mmol/l EDTA,
1 mmol/l DTT, 1 mmol/l PMSF, l ␮g/ml Leupeptin) and left to swell
on ice for 15 min, then 10 ␮l 10% NP-40 was added and the suspension was vortexed for 10 s; (2) centrifuged for 20 s 10,000 × g.
The supernatant was removed and the pellet was mixed with
50–100 ␮l Buffer B (20 mmol/L Hepes-NaOH (pH7. 9). 1.5 mmol/l
MgCl2 , 0.42 mol/l NaCl, 0.2 mmol/l EDTA, 25% glycerin, 0.5 mmol/l
DTT, 0.5 mmol/l PMSF, 1 ␮g/ml Leupeptin) and placed in an icebath for 30 min. (3) Centrifuged for 4 min, 12,000 × g. Nucleoprotein
was in the supernatant. After electrophoresis (separation on a 10%
SDS-PAGE gel) and transfer to PVDF membranes (200 mA and 2.5 h)
the membranes were then incubated with blocking solution (5%
nonfat dried milk powder dissolved in TBST buffer-pH 7.5, 10 mM
Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with TBST, and incubated with a mouse
monoclonal anti-NF-␬B antibody (1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz, USA)
for 24 h at 4 ◦ C in a refrigerator. The membranes were washed
three times with TBST buffer and then incubated with the secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz, USA) for 1 h followed
by washing four times. Signal detection was performed with an
enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Beyotime, China). Histone was
chosen as the Internal Control [18]. The band intensities were determined using Image-Pro Plus 6.0.
Statistical analysis
All descriptive statistics, including mean ± SD, were performed.
Repeated-measures of two-way ANOVA was used to test differences among the model and vinpocetine groups. For the main effect
of time, when the P value is statistically signiﬁcant, comparison
procedure was applied by using the post hoc test. ANOVA for multigroup analysis, and comparison among groups used a Q test. The
water content and NF-␬B expression of the ischemic area of the
cerebrum was analyzed with linear correlation analysis. SPSS 13.0
for Windows software was used for statistical analyses with a P
value of <0.05 considered statistically signiﬁcant.

the levels were still higher than the control group at day 7 (both
P < 0.05). The results are shown in Fig. 2.
NF-B and TNF-˛ expression levels
Compared with the control group, the expression levels of NF␬B in the model group increased at 6 h after reperfusion (P < 0.05)
and TNF-␣ expression levels increased at 24 h (P < 0.05). Both proteins reached their peak at 3 days (both P < 0.05). The levels then
gradually decreased, but were still higher than the control group
at 7 days (both P < 0.05). Compared with the model group, NF-␬B
and TNF-␣ expression in the vinpocetine group decreased at 24 h,
3 days and 7 days after reperfusion (all P < 0.05). NF-␬B expression
showed no statistical difference between the control group and the
vinpocetine group (P > 0.05). The comparisons between the control
group and the vinpocetine group at each time point also showed
no statistical differences (both P > 0.05). The results are shown in
Fig. 3.
TNF-˛ mRNA expression levels
Compared with the control group the expression of TNF-␣
mRNA in both the model group and the vinpocetine group increased
24 h after reperfusion (both P < 0.05). Both groups reached a peak at
3 days (both P < 0.05). Compared with the model group the expression of TNF-a mRNA in the vinpocetine group was lower at 24 h,

Results
Comparison of infarct size/volume
There were no infarctions in the control group. The infarctions in
both the model group and the vinpocetine group appeared 6 h after
reperfusion. Ischemic brain tissue was found at 24 h and 3 days,
and at 3 days the infarction and edema was the most obvious, after
which it decreased (7 days) (both P < 0.05). The ischemic volume of
the vinpocetine group was much more decreased than the model
group (P < 0.05). The results are shown in Fig. 1.
Changes in brain water content
Compared with the control group the brain water content of
both the model group and the vinpocetine group increased at 6 h
after reperfusion (both P < 0.05). Both groups reached a peak at 3
days (both P < 0.05). After that there was a gradual decrease, but

Western blot analysis of NF-B P65 protein
At the 24 h time point, compared with the control group the
expression of NF-␬B in both the model group and the vinpocetine group increased after reperfusion (both P < 0.05). There was
a statistically signiﬁcant difference between the model group and
the vinpocetine group at 24 h (P < 0.05), conﬁrming that vinpocetine inhibited the expression of NF-␬B. Compared with other time
points of the model group, the expression of NF-␬B at 24 h and 3
days has statistical signiﬁcance (both P < 0.05), showing the change

Relationship between brain water content in ischemic brain tissue
and the expression of NF-kB
Comparison showed there was a positive correlation between
the brain water content in ischemic brain tissue after reperfusion
and the expression of NF-␬B (r = 0.4324, P < 0.01).

Discussion
This study used a rat model to investigate cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion, and if treatment with vinpocetine could
improve their outcome. The inﬂammatory response was the main
process of interest and the rat model demonstrated that expression
levels of NF-␬B began to rise 6 h after reperfusion increasing to a
peak after 3 days, 7 days later expression levels were still high.
There was a signiﬁcant increase in TNF-␣ and TNF-␣ mRNA expression 24 h after reperfusion with a peak at 3 days and expression
remained high after 7 days. This suggests that NF-␬B expression
occurs ﬁrst and then mediates transcription of TNF-␣. Vinpocetine
intervention signiﬁcantly reduced the expression of NF-␬B and
TNF-␣ by 24 h after reperfusion and for the 7 days studied. The
expression levels of NF-␬B were fairly constant throughout the
time of the study in the vinpocetine-treated group with no statistical differences between them. After 3 days the vinpocetine-treated
group showed less infarction volume and cerebral edema than the
untreated rat model group. Cerebral edema and NF-␬B expression
correlated signiﬁcantly, suggesting that vinpocetine blocks the
inﬂammatory response pathway and does this by lowering NF-␬B
and TNF-␣ expression levels.
Prior research has suggested that vinpocetine has a role in reducing the inﬂammatory response. Vitro experiments have shown that
in a wide range of cells vinpocetine can reduce TNF-␣ induced activation of NF-␬B [6]. RT-PCR analysis found that vinpocetine can
reduce the expression of TNF-␣, IL-1␤, vascular endothelial cell
adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) mRNA during inﬂammation [11].
In our positive expression NF-␬B is mainly located in the cell
nucleus, while TNF-␣ is mainly in the cytoplasm. In cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion injury I␬B and NF-␬B dissociate exposing
RE and NF-␬B moves into nucleus. This series of events initiates
transcription regulation thus leading to the transcription of TNF-␣
mRNA and so TNF-␣ is highly expressed. We found the nuclear
NF-␬B levels in the vinpocetine-treated group were lower than
in the untreated rat model so we speculated that vinpocetine

suppressed the movement of NF-␬B from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus. But whether this occurs by inhibiting IkB phosphorylation, by decreasing I␬B levels in the cytoplasm, or by preventing
I␬B and NF-␬B dissociation needs further study.
In conclusion vinpocetine blocks the inﬂammatory response
pathway after ischemia–reperfusion injury of rats; it can
delay necrosis and reduce cerebral infarction volume. With
further research, vinpocetine should become an effective antiinﬂammatory drug in the treatment of neurological diseases.
