The neuroprotective effects of neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) on stroke lesions were assessed longitudinally in rats with
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) using MRI. Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 16, 250 ± 20 g) underwent permanent MCAo surgery with cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) monitored by laser doppler ﬂowmetry at ipsilateral side of
bregma for 20 min post-occlusion. A single 50 μl bolus dose of NRG-1 or vehicle was administered into the left
internal carotid artery immediately prior to MCAo. The expansion of the ischemic lesion into the cortex was attenuated by NRG-1 over a 48-hour (h) time span as measured by diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). The ﬁnal
infarct volumes of NRG-1 treated rats were signiﬁcantly smaller than those of the vehicle treated rats at 48 h
(264.8 ± 192.1 vs. 533.4 ± 175.5 mm3, p b 0.05). The NRG-1 treated rats were further subdivided into 2 subgroups according to their CBF reduction during stroke surgery: mild ischemia (b70% CBF reduction) or severe
ischemia (N70% CBF reduction). In particular, ischemic infarction was not usually observed in the cortex of
NRG-1 treated rats with mild ischemia at 3 and 48 h post-occlusion. Histological results validated the imaging
ﬁndings and demonstrated that NRG-1 treated rats had fewer injured neurons in peri-infarct areas 48 h postischemia. In summary, the neuroprotective effect of NRG-1 in the pMCAo stroke model was demonstrated by prevention of ischemic lesion expansion, reduced infarct volume and protection of neurons from ischemic damage.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability and fourth leading
cause of death in the United States [22]. More than 700,000 people
have a stroke each year in the United States. Among them, about 80%
of strokes are caused by focal cerebral ischemia due to arterial occlusion
and the remaining are caused by hemorrhages [5]. Currently, the only
FDA-approved post-stroke intervention is intravenous thrombolysis
using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within
4.5 hours (h) after the symptom onset [1,10]. Treatment with rt-PA
can provide reperfusion of the ischemic territory and results in the salvage of the ischemic penumbra, reduced ﬁnal infarct size, and improved
clinical outcomes. However, such thrombolysis strategy has many limitations including a short treatment time window and increased hemorrhage complication [9,25]. As a result, only few (typically 2% to 5%)

patients are able to receive rt-PA reperfusion therapies in clinic practice
[1,10]. Therefore, strategies that can extend the time window for thrombolysis are still being pursued extensively.
Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is a family of growth factors with multiple
potent effects that include acetylcholine receptor inducing activity
(ARIA), glial growth factor-2, heregulins and neu differentiation factors
[4]. Its neuroprotective effects for ischemic brain injury have been
reported [13,14,26,28]. In a rat model with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo), NRG-1 reduced cortical infarct volume by 90% if
administered immediately after the onset of stroke and exhibited a therapeutic window of N13 h [26,28]. Such treatment efﬁcacy of NRG-1 on
stroke was evaluated previously using histological analysis within 24 h
but not characterized longitudinally.
Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is the most sensitive MRI modality to detect early stroke injury and has been widely utilized to assess
the infarct evolution immediately after stroke onset [19,29]. Meanwhile,
the apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC, derived from DWI) demonstrates to be a robust imaging marker to evaluate the stroke lesion evolution and is time-dependent during acute stroke [20]. T2-weighted
imaging is sensitive to brain tissue water content and can reveal vascular brain edema during acute stroke and identify the ﬁnal infarct territory. In particular, quantitative T2 measurement can be used to estimate

S. Wang et al. / Journal of the Neurological Sciences 357 (2015) 28–34

the water uptake in ischemic tissue [24]. Such MRI parameters provide
complementary information to assess the structural alteration in
stroke-damaged brains with or without therapeutic treatment.
The neuroprotective effects of NRG-1 on stroke injury have been
demonstrated in our previous reports. However, the spatial–temporal evolution of ischemic lesion treated by NRG-1 and its relationship with histological ﬁndings remain unknown. The overall goals
of this study are therefore to assess the neuroprotective effects of NRG1 using MRI for better translation of ﬁndings in the animal into clinical
trials.

2. Methods
2.1. Animal model preparation
All procedures followed the protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Emory University in accordance with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All
surgical procedures were performed with sterile/aseptic techniques in
accordance with institutional guidelines. Adult Sprague–Dawley rats
weighing 230–270 g were used in this study. Rats were anesthetized
using isoﬂurane (3% for induction and 2% for maintenance) mixed
with O2. Permanent MCAo was induced by the intraluminal suture
MCAo method as previously described [14,28]. Brieﬂy, the left common
carotid artery (CCA) was exposed through a midline incision and was
carefully dissected free from surrounding nerves and fascia. The internal
carotid artery (ICA) was isolated and carefully separated from the adjacent vagus nerve, and the pterygopalatine artery was ligated close to its
origin with a 6-0 silk suture. Then, a 40 mm 4-0 surgical monoﬁlament
nylon suture coated with rubber silicone (diameter 0.39 mm; length
2.3–2.5 mm) was inserted from the external carotid artery (ECA) into
the internal carotid artery (ICA) and then into the circle of Willis to occlude the origin of the left middle cerebral artery.
Laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) (wavelength, 780 nm; probe 407,
Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden) was used to continuously monitor cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) changes prior to, during, and 20 min following
vessel occlusion to conﬁrm appropriate occlusion. A micro drill was
used to make a 0.9 mm diameter parietal burr hole in the cranial skull
at 2.0 mm posterior and 7.0 mm lateral to bregma. The burr hole did
not penetrate the full thickness of the skull and the brain was not exposed in this procedure. The LDF probe was placed in the created defect
in the skull and ﬁxed with sterile tissue glue. After CBF measurement,
the probe was removed and the muscle and skin was closed. The
CBF reduction was calculated as: (pre-occlusion CBF)-(post-occlusion CBF)/pre-occlusion CBF × 100%.

2.2. NRG-1 administration
To determine the effects of NRG-1 on ischemic stroke, rats were
randomized and injected intra-arterially with a single bolus 50 μl
dose of vehicle (1%BSA in PBS) or NRG-1β (20 μg/kg, EGF-like domain, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota) through a Hamilton
syringe as previously described [14,26]. NRG-1 (n = 10) or vehicle
(n = 6) treated rats were administered by bolus injection into the
ICA through ECA immediately before pMCAo. All NRG-1 and vehicle
treatment studies were performed in a blinded manner. To evaluate
the potential effects induced by NRG-1, physiological parameters including heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2, temperature and CBF were
continuously monitored at the baseline, during surgery and 20 min
after injection of NRG-1 with the Mouse-Ox system (Starr life science, USA). During the surgery and MRI scans, the body temperature
was monitored with a rectal probe (Starr life science, USA) and
maintained at ~ 37 °C with a Homeothermic Blanket Control Unit
(Harvard Apparatus).

2.3. MRI data acquisition
In vivo MRI was performed using a 7 T animal MRI scanner (Bruker
BioSpin, Billerica, MA) and a surface coil (internal diameter = 2.5 cm).
The rats were immobilized with a custom-made head holder with earbars and teeth-bar during MRI scanning. All rats were imaged immediately after surgery from 0.5 h to 3 h and rescanned at 48 h post-surgery
(Fig. 1). Coronal MRI sections were performed from 2 mm anterior to
the corpus callosum to the end of the cerebrum. T2-weighted imaging
(T2WI) was acquired with the following parameters: ﬁeld of view
(FOV) = 3.0 × 3.0 cm2, matrix size = 256 × 256, repetition time
(TR) = 1000 ms and echo time (TE) = 50 ms, slice thickness =
1.0 mm. DTI was acquired with a four-shot EPI sequence. The imaging
parameters were: TR = 3000 ms, TE = 32 ms, Δ = 20 ms, δ = 4 ms,
FOV = 3.0 × 3.0 cm2, slice thickness = 1.0 mm, matrix size =
128 × 128, NEX = 4, 30 gradient directions, b value = 1000 s/
mm 2, respectively. To determine the stroke lesion area, each ROI
was identiﬁed by referring to DWI and T2-weighted images. With
each rat brain, the area of the stroke lesion and total brain area in
every slice was manually measured using ImageJ 1.34 (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Then, the total stroke volume
was calculated as the sum of the lesion area across all slices, multiplied by the total slice thickness.
2.4. Histopathology evaluation
Rats were sacriﬁced for histological evaluation immediately after
their last MRI scans (48 h post-stroke) without recovery from anesthesia. 1.0 mm-thick brain sections were stained with 2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution and then transferred into a 4%
formaldehyde solution for ﬁxation. For immunohistology, brain specimens were processed using standard histological protocols [14,26,27].
Brieﬂy, rat brains were perfusion-ﬁxed through the left cardiac ventricle
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) in PBS. Brains were quickly removed and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. The brains were then frozen in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek,
Torrance, CA) and stored at −80 °C until sectioning. Coronal sections of
20 μm thickness were cryosectioned and mounted on slides which were
then stored at −80 °C until further processed. Brain sections were
washed in PBS and incubated with Cy3 conjugated anti-NeuN (1:500,
Millipore) overnight at 4 °C. Slides were then washed with PBS and
mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI. For double staining with Fluoro-Jade B (FJB) (Chemicon International, Temecula,
CA, USA) double labeling, immunostaining was performed ﬁrst and then
sections were incubated with 0.15% potassium permanganate for 1 min,
washed with distilled water for 2 min and treated with 0.0001% FJB in
0.1% acetic acid for 10 min. Sections were then washed and coverslipped
in glycerol/0.3% acetic acid mounting medium. All sections were examined with ﬂuorescence microscopy in three random MCA served areas
in the inner border of the infarct in the ischemic fronto-parietal cortex
of each rat.
2.5. Neurological assessment
Standard neurological tests, utilizing a 6-point neurological scale
(0 = no deﬁcit, 1 = failure to extend left forepaw fully, 2 = circling
to the left, 3 = falling to the left, 4 = no spontaneous walking with a
depressed level of consciousness, and 5 = dead), were performed at
24 h and 48 h post-occlusion [23].
2.6. Statistical analysis
All results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
The student t-test was applied to evaluate differences between the
stroke volumes of the vehicle and treatment groups. We further analyzed the infarct volumes of the NRG-1 treated rats, by dividing

animals into two subgroups based upon the CBF reduction after
pMCAo (mean CBF reduction = 76%): the mild ischemia group
which consisted of the rats with less than 70% CBF reduction and
the severe ischemia group which had the rats with more than 70%
CBF reduction during surgery. A one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) test, followed by the Tukey test, was applied to analyze
the statistical differences in infarct volumes between vehicle and
NRG-1 treatment groups. The Pearson correlation test was used to
evaluate correlations between MRI results and CBF reduction. All statistical analysis procedures were performed using the SPSS for Windows statistical package (Version 18, SPSS, Chicago, IL). A p-value
less than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Physiological parameters after MCAo and NRG-1 administration
Physiological parameters were continually monitored at the
baseline, during surgery and after injection of NRG-1. NRG-1 did
not signiﬁcantly change any of the following physiological parameters in our studies, including heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2, temperature (Table 1), consistent with our previous ﬁndings using the
transient MCAo model [28]. Also, NRG-1 did not alter CBF signiﬁcantly, suggesting that vascular blood ﬂow was not affected signiﬁcantly due to the administration of NRG-1 (Fig. 2).
3.2. Stroke lesion volume analysis after NRG-1 treatment

hypointensity and DWI hyperintensity was observed at both striatum (100% of animals) and cortex (83% of animals, 5/6) as early as
0.5 h post-occlusion. In contrast, NRG-1 treated rats showed ischemic lesions mostly within the striatum (70%, 7/10) at the 3 h and
48 h time point (Fig. 3). It is known that early injury in the striatum
is the core ischemic zone in the MCAo model [7], therefore the result
of ischemic lesion after NRG-1 treatment suggests its penumbral
protection in the cortex.
In order to evaluate the treatment efﬁcacy of NRG-1 in rats with
different severities of ischemia, we further analyzed the infarct volumes
of the NRG-1 treated rats. These rats were divided into two subgroups
based upon the CBF reduction after MCAo and the results are shown
in Fig. 4.1. NRG-1 treated rats have signiﬁcantly decreased infarct volume compared to vehicle group (both p b 0.05) following mild and severe CBF reduction. The infarct volumes of NRG-1 treated group were
signiﬁcantly smaller than those in vehicle treated group at all time
points post-occlusion (all p b 0.05). In contrast, no signiﬁcant difference
was observed in the infarct volumes of vehicle group rats divided by the
same CBF reduction threshold (p N 0.30 at all time points). When comparing the infarct volumes in mild and severe ischemia groups it was
found that the NRG-1 was more effective at neuroprotection in the
mild ischemia group. Longitudinally, the mean stroke volume at 48 h
was signiﬁcantly larger than that at any early points (p b 0.001) in
both vehicle and treatment groups. At 48 h post-occlusion, infarct volume was reduced by 66% in the mild CBF reduction group compared
to 40% in the severe group (180.8 ± 70.8 vs. 321.0 ± 232.3 mm3, p b
0.05). Overall, signiﬁcant but weak correlations between the mean
stroke volume and CBF reduction during the surgery were observed
(p = 0.003, r = 0.326).

Infarct volumes following MCAo were measured with longitudinal
DWI images (1–3 h post-occlusion) and T2WI at the 48 h time point.
Compared to the vehicle treated group, the infarct volumes of NRG-1
treated group were signiﬁcantly reduced at 0.5 h (85.0 ± 20.1 vs.
44.4 ± 21.2 mm3), 1 h (118.6 ± 70 vs. 56.5 ± 27.1 mm3), 2 h
(147.2 ± 75.6 vs. 75.6 ± 41.2 mm3), 3 h (211.1 ± 126.9 vs. 83.0 ±
45.6 mm3) and 48 h (533.4 ± 175.4 vs. 264.8 ± 192.1 mm3) post-occlusion (all p b 0.05). In the vehicle-treated rats, the region of ADC

regions expand to most of ipsilateral brain including cortex.

In addition, we evaluated the temporal evolution of stroke infarct
volumes with the formula reported previously [30]:

logarithm.
The ﬁtting results are shown in Fig. 4.2. It is demonstrated that the
evolution of the infarct volume follows the logarithmic pattern in rats
without treatment (R2 = 0.9091), as similar as those reported previously in macaque brains with pMCAo [30]. Such pattern is also seen in rats
with NRG-1 treatment (R2 = 0.9943 and 0.9451 with severe and mild
stroke, respectively). In particular, the infarct growth rates decrease remarkably in rats of treatment groups compared to those in control
group.

time points. The infarct volumes of vehicle group (blue line with diamond symbol) were
signiﬁcantly larger than those in NRG-1 treated group at all time points post-occlusion
(all p b 0.05). In comparison of the stroke volumes in mild (red line with square marker)
and severe ischemia group (green line with triangle marker) according to CBF reduction
during surgery, the neuroprotective effects of NRG-1 are obviously better in the mild ischemia group. The star indicated the signiﬁcant difference between vehicle and treatment
groups.

detected by MRI at 48 h post-stroke correlated well with that seen in TTC
staining (Fig. 5). The immunohistological results of NRG-1 treated and
vehicle rats at 48 h post-occlusion are shown in Fig. 6. FJB labeling of
brain tissues without treatment revealed numerous FJB-positive cells in
the ischemic cortex and subcortical areas (Fig. 6A). In contrast, NRG-1
pretreatment effectively abolished FJB labeling as illustrated in representative photomicrographs (Fig. 6B). The injured areas showed high numbers of FJB labeling, and low or no NeuN expressing cells (Fig. 6C).
Neighboring neurons that were not injured showed relatively higher
levels of NeuN immunoreactivity. NRG-1 treatment rescued NeuN immunoreactivity (Fig. 6D).
3.4. Neurologic assessment of rats following MCAo and NRG-1 treatment
The mean neurological scores of NRG-1 versus vehicle-treated rats
were, 1.5 vs. 2.0 at 24 h (p = 0.04), and 3.0 vs. 4.7 at 48 h post-occlusion
(p = 0.01), respectively (Fig. 7). The results indicated that NRG-1 treated rats had less progression of general decline in neurological status
compared to vehicle group.
4. Discussion
We assessed the neuroprotective effects of NRG-1 in a rat model of
pMCAo using MRI. We demonstrated that NRG-1 provided neuroprotection during the acute ischemic insult as indicated by reducing the infarct volume and reduced injury of neurons following ischemic insults,
consistent with our previous results [14,26,28]. In particular, it is found
that the efﬁcacy of NRG-1's neuroprotection is related with the severity
of stroke insult. As seen in the present report, NRG-1 exhibits signiﬁcantly
stronger neuroprotection in rats with mild ischemia than those with severe ischemia 48 h post-occlusion.
Diffusion MRI has been widely used in animal and clinical studies to
evaluate ischemic brain injury because of its unique ability for very early
detection of ischemic lesion and the correlation with ﬁnal infarct volume [17], a strong predictor of clinical outcome. Early signal increase
of DWI images reﬂects cell swelling in ischemic brain tissue due to energy
failure of Na/K-ATP pump. In addition, ADC allows for quantitatively characterizing ischemic lesion. After initial decrease of ADC values in acute
phase, ADC gradually recovers to baseline value due to water inﬂux
from vessels to brain tissue, namely vasogenic edema [18]. NRG-1 treated
group showed relatively slow ADC recovery until 48 h, especially in the
mild ischemic lesion group (data not shown), indicating the mitigated

impact of the vessel occlusion on neuronal injury compared to vehicle
group. Histological evaluation also indicated that there were much
fewer injured neurons in the NRG-1 treated group compared to vehicle
group.
It has been reported that the infarct volume evolution in macaque
brains with pMCAo follows a logarithmic pattern during acute stroke
for up to 48 h post-occlusion [30]. In the present study, the formula
was also applied to ﬁt the infarct evolution in rats with pMCAo to examine the temporal-spatial changes of infarct with/without treatment. As
seen in Fig. 4.2, the temporal changes of infarct volume in control and
treatment groups exhibits a good ﬁtting of logarithmic pattern, as similar as those seen in macaque brains with pMCAo (without treatment).
After NRG-1 treatment, the growth rates of infarct volume dramatically
decrease (64.6, 29.5, and 11.4 in control group, treatment groups with
severe and mild ischemia, respectively. unit: mm3 per hour (log scale)),
indicating the treatment intervention alters the course of infarct evolution
remarkably. Also, the growth rate is much smaller in rats with mild ischemia in which higher neuroprotection efﬁcacy of NRG-1 was observed,
suggesting that the growth rate may be a complementary and sensitive
indicator to assess the efﬁcacy of pharmaceutical treatment in subjects
with pMCAo.
The exact mechanism of the NRG-1 neuroprotective effects remains
inconclusive. Without supply of oxygen and glucose, the cell death
occurs due to the energy failure, which leads to shut down of ATP dependent Na+/K+-ATPase. Consequently, massive Na+ and Ca2+ cytoplasmic accumulation leads to overactivation of the NMDA subtype of
glutamate receptors. Finally, cytoplasmic accumulation or Ca2 + ultimately leads to necrotic cell death [15]. NRG-1 may block NMDA receptors which prevent glutamate-mediated excitotoxic as well as necrotic
neuronal death [8]. Another possible mechanism is that NRG-1 may
play a key role in inhibition of apoptotic and pro-inﬂammatory responses [4,26–28]. NRG-1 prevented ischemia-induced mononuclear
inﬁltration, astrocyte activation and cytokine production, which are
known to be associated with delayed neuronal death following ischemia [4,26–28].
Another important question is whether physiological parameters,
including CBF are altered after NRG-1 administration. Xu et al. [28]
analyzed physiological parameters in vehicle and NRG-1-treated animals before and after transient MCAo and showed that NRG-1 did not
signiﬁcantly affect any of the physiological parameters including pH,
pCO2, PO2, Hct (%), Na+, K+, Ca2+, heart rate, mean arterial pressure
and blood pressure. Similarly, our current data suggested that NRG-1

did not affect physiological parameters or CBF during the MCAo procedure. Further perfusion measurements with MRI may be employed to
validate the CBF results in the future study.
The neuroprotective effects of NRG-1 were partially contingent on
the initial severity of ischemic insults. Our results show that NRG-1 neuroprotective effects are pronounced in mild ischemic insults (i.e., less
than 70% CBF reduction) compared to severe ischemic insults. The CBF
threshold was determined empirically based upon the present study.
Initial CBF reduction status after stroke insult may be a key factor to determine the NRG-1 neuroprotective efﬁcacy. Additionally, the neuroprotective effects of NRG-1 at current dose were associated with the severity
of injury and the CBF threshold and could be a dose-dependent effect.
The dosage effect of NRG-1 will be further studied to determine the optimal dosage for maximal neuroprotection during mild and severe
ischemia.

Our ﬁndings suggest that NRG-1 given before pMCAO can reduce the
infarction. The results from other models in our laboratory also indicate
that a single administration of NRG-1 is sufﬁcient to block the downstream mechanisms of acute brain injury, even in the presence of the insult. We reported previously that NRG-1 blocked downstream neurotoxic
and pro-inﬂammatory responses in animal models of nerve agent exposure and experimental cerebral malaria without affecting the levels of
AChE inhibition or parasite numbers, respectively [13,21]. Therefore, it
is not unexpected that NRG-1 prevents neuronal death despite the persistence of severe CBF reduction. We propose that NRG-1 blocks the
pro-inﬂammatory responses downstream of ischemia that lead to secondary neuronal death.
NRG-1 was delivered intra-arterially (i.a.) before pMCAo in the present study. With regard to i.a. administration, there is clear precedence
for its utility in a number of neurological disorders, including
stroke [2,11]. In fact, rt-PA, the only drug FDA approved for stroke
therapy, was shown in clinical trials to be safe and efﬁcacious 6 h
after stroke compared to the 3–4 h therapeutic window for intravenous (i.v.) administration [3]. However, we expect that i.v. administration of NRG-1 will provide similar neuroprotection as
previously demonstrated in other models of acute brain injury
[12,16]. In addition, ongoing pilot studies are examining whether
NRG-1 can also be delivered i.v. and intra-nasally to treat ischemic
neuronal injury.
In summary, the spatio-temporal neuroprotective effects of NRG-1
were demonstrated in a rat model of stroke using MRI and histological
evaluations. More studies are needed to fully understand the mechanisms of NRG-1 neuroprotective effects and to optimize the treatment
strategy in stroke patients. In vivo multiparametric MRI could serve as
a valuable monitor tool in this endeavor.

Fig. 7. Neurological assessment. Standard neurological tests utilizing a 6-point neurological
scale (0 = no deﬁcit, 1 = failure to extend left forepaw fully, 2 = circling to the left, 3 =
falling to the left, 4 = no spontaneous walking with a depressed level of consciousness,
and 5 = dead) were performed at 24 h post-occlusion and 48 h post-occlusion. Gray
bar = NRG-1 treated rats, black bar = vehicle treated rats.
