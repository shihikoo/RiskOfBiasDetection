Lead compound 7 has neuroprotective effects, and it was discovered by screening a small synthetic
natural product-like (NPL) library. Based on the lead, a series of tricyclic diterpene derivatives was
designed and synthesized, and their neuroprotective effects were further evaluated against glutamate-,
oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)- and nutrient deprivation-induced neuronal injury using cellbased assays. To our delight, most of these synthetic compounds exhibited increased neuroprotective
effects and bloodebrain barrier (BBB) permeability without cellular toxicity. The most potent compound,
compound 30, showed signiﬁcantly improved neuroprotection against neuronal injury in primary
neurons. Furthermore, compound 30 exhibited remarkable neuroprotection in transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (tMCAO) rats by reducing their infarct sizes and neurological deﬁcit scores. A mechanistic exploration using in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the neuroprotection of these
compounds was at least partly mediated by improving the levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein. Therefore, these tricyclic diterpene derivatives
could be used as promising leads for the development of a new type of neuroprotective agents against
ischemic brain injury.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke, which results from a transient or permanent
reduction in cerebral blood ﬂow, accounts for more than 80% of all
strokes and is a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality
throughout the world [1]. In general, brain ischemia is characterized by excess glutamate release, insufﬁcient nutrient supply, and
oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), which result in neuronal
death. Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter that plays
an important role in the mammalian brain [2]. However, excessive
release of this amino acid can induce excitotoxicity, which is a

major factor in neuronal injury that is associated with many acute
and chronic brain disorders, such as neurodegenerative diseases
(for example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases) [3,4], traumatic brain injury
[5], and especially brain ischemic stroke [6]. An excessive level of
the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is not only a key factor in
ischemia-induced neuronal injury, but it also produces reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and further leads to the inhibition of antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione
(GSH) synthesis [7]. Oxidative stress is also considered to be one of
the major mechanisms that triggers the pathogenic actions of
ischemic stroke [8], which is produced when ROS surpass the
endogenous antioxidant system, leading to the injury of essential
components in neural cells [9]. Therefore, the reduction of ROS has
been considered a promising remedy to attenuate neuronal damage from ischemia [10]. This reduction includes elements such as
the antioxidative enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which

Y.-Y. Wang et al. / European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 103 (2015) 396e408

protects neurons from the deleterious effects of ROS [11]. To date,
the only drug that is currently approved by the FDA to treat
ischemic strokes is tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), which has a
very short therapeutic window (3 h) and is used in less than 5% of
stroke patients, thus signiﬁcantly limiting the percentage of treatable subjects [12,13]. This deﬁciency indicates an urgent need to
search for novel agents with neuroprotective effects to provide
treatments for brain ischemic strokes.
Diterpenoids are a large family of natural products that exhibit a
wide range of biological activities, such as anti-inﬂammatory, antiHIV, anti-tumor, anti-diabetic, antibacterial and especially neuroprotective activity [14e16]. For instance (Fig. 1), carnosic acid, a
component of rosemary, strongly promotes neurite outgrowth by
activating antioxidant responsive element (ARE)-mediated transcription through the activation of Nrf2 [17]; serofendic acid, a
sulfur-containing diterpenoid derived from fetal calf serum, exhibits potent neuroprotective actions in neurons against the cytotoxicity of glutamate and nitric oxide [18,19]; triptolide, the major
active component of Tripterygium extracts, exerts both neuroprotective and neurotrophic activities in Parkinson's disease
models [20,21]. Natural products have provided a rich resource for
drug discovery in recent years [22]. However, the scarcity and poor
activities of these products frequently limit their development.
Recently, the production of modiﬁed, natural-based compounds
and synthetic natural analogs has been shown to be an effective
strategy in drug discovery.
In our search for novel and potent anti-ischemic agents, we
report the discovery of neuroprotective leads that were uncovered
by screening our small synthetic natural product-like (NPL) library
against glutamate-induced neuronal injury. This novel small NPL
library contains approximately 200 tricyclic diterpene analogs, and
it was constructed based on the cyclization reaction [23,24]. Compound 7 (Scheme 1) of the NPL library was chosen as a novel
neuroprotective lead, and its neuroprotective percentage against
glutamate-induced neuronal injury was 53.7% (Table 1), respectively. A series of tricyclic diterpene analogs was synthesized based
on the lead compound. These newly synthesized analogs were
evaluated for their neuroprotective effects against glutamate-,
OGD- and nutrient deprivation-induced injury in cell-based assays.
The most potent analog was further evaluated for its neuroprotective effects in a rat cerebral ischemia model.
2. Chemistry
The lead compound and a series of tricyclic diterpene derivatives (methylol, esters, acyls and amides) was synthesized according to the pathways described in Schemes 1e3.
The synthesis of lead compound and diterpenoid methylol and
esters is outlined in Scheme 1. Compound 6 was synthesized according to our previously reported procedure [25]. The details were
as follows. The coupling reaction of 6,7-epoxygeranyl acetate with
4-methoxybenzylmagnesium chloride in the presence of Li2CuCl4
yielded compound 1. Key intermediate 2 was obtained by the
cyclization of 1 under the Lewis acid Et2AlCl. The bromination of

compound 2 with Br2 in CH2Cl2 furnished intermediate 3. Compound 4 was produced by the protection of the 3-hydroxyl group of
3 with TBSCl. The treatment of 4 with n-butyllithium, and then with
dry CO2 afforded compound 5. The deprotection of the TBS group
under boron triﬂuoride etherate afforded compound 6. According
to the Stork-Eschenmoser hypothesis [26,27], compound 2 is a
racemate, thus all the synthesized diterpenoids herein belong to
racemates.
The esteriﬁcation of 6 with corresponding alcohols in the
presence of a catalytic amount of H2SO4 gave lead compound 7 and
compounds 8 and 9. The methylol 11 was obtained by the reduction
of 5 with LiAlH4 and then the deprotection of the TBS group under
boron triﬂuoride etherate.
The synthesis of diterpenoid acyls is outlined in Scheme 2.
Compounds 13e17 were furnished by the esteriﬁcation of compound 2 with acetic anhydride under DMAP, followed by FriedeleCrafts acylation with various acyl chlorides respectively. The
hydrolysis of 13e17 with NaOH in MeOH produced compounds
18e22. Treatment of 18 with BBr3 produced compound 23. The
oxidation of 18 with 2-iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) formed compound
24. Compound 25 was prepared by the esteriﬁcation of 18 with
triﬂuoroacetic anhydride.
The synthesis of diterpenoid amides is outlined in Scheme 3.
Amide derivatives 26e32 were synthesized by the condensation of
6 with amines or their hydrochlorides under 1-ethyl-3-(3dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide
(EDCI)
and
1hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in CH2Cl2. The hydrolysis of 29 with
LiOH in THF afforded 33.
3. Result and discussion
3.1. Neuroprotective effects against neuronal damage induced by
glutamate
Glutamate is the primary excitatory amino acid in the
mammalian brain. The glutamate-induced over-excitation of neurons plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration
[28]. For instance, the ischemic stroke is related to a dramatic increase in excitatory glutamate in the extracellular space. The neuroprotective effects of the lead compound 7 and their synthetic
derivatives 6 and 8e33 were evaluated against glutamate-induced
injury in primary rat cerebellar granule neuronal cells. The results
are shown in Table 1.
Compared with lead compound 7 (53.7%, neuroprotection),
most of these derivatives showed increased or equivalent cell
viability against glutamate-induced neuronal injury. Compounds
13, 18, 23, 25e27 and 30e32 exhibited more neuroprotective
abilities than the leads. Compounds 18 and 30 in particular
possessed much more neuroprotective potency than 7.
For acyl-substituted compounds, the small acetyl group (18)
showed much more potent activity than the relatively large propionyl (19), 3-methoxypropionyl (20), isobutyryl (21) and octanoyl
(22) groups. Notably, 21 and 22 showed almost no activity against
glutamate-induced neuronal injury. If the methoxy group on the
benzene ring was hydrolyzed to a hydroxyl group (Scheme 2), the
activity was clearly decreased, and a similar situation occurred as
the 3-hydroxyl group was oxidized to carbonyl (18 vs 23 and 24).
For amide substituted compounds, the butyramide group (30)
was better than other amide substituents (26e28 and 31e33).
Compound 30 (10 mM) showed the most potent neuroprotective
activity against neuronal damage induced by glutamate, and was
more effective than positive control edaravone (50 mM).
For ester-substituted compounds, regardless of the ethyl and
butyl esters (8 and 9), they had no obvious improving effects in
terms of neuroprotection compared with 7, and a similar situation

In addition, the compounds that possessed a neuroprotective
potency of more than 65 percent of neuroprotection were selected
for activity testing at different doses. The results showed that these
compounds exerted a well-deﬁned dose-dependent response

against glutamate-induced neuronal damage (Fig. 2).

system (CNS) and cell death. Lead compound 7 and compounds 13,
18, 25, 30 and 31 possessed neuroprotective potencies of more than
65% (Table 1) against glutamate-induced neuronal damage, and
they were further selected to examine their protective effects
against OGD-induced neuronal death. Edaravone was used as a
positive control. The results showed that the effects of the protection against OGD-induced damage were not exactly the same with
glutamate-induced neuronal damage (Table 2). Most selected
compounds showed decreased activity compared with 7, except 18
and 30. When the compound concentrations were increased from
1 mM to 10 mM, the cell viability percentages increased. The neuroprotection percentage of acyl substituted compound 18 was 11.9%

more potent than that of 7. The most potent amide-substituted
compound, which was compound 30, exhibited 75.4% neuroprotection against OGD-induced injury at 10 mM, which was almost
2-fold more potent than 7.

require nutrients, including serum, to survive and exert their
functions [29]. In several brain diseases, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI), there are insufﬁcient nutrients to support

neuron survival, resulting in neuronal death. The cultured neurons
can survive in the presence of the nutrient B27, a serum substitute.
If the B27 is removed, the majority of the neurons will die [30]. Lead
compound 7 and compounds 13, 18, 25, 30 and 31 were selected to
evaluate their activity against nutrient deprivation-induced damage in neuronal cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was used as a positive
control. As shown in Table 3, most tested compounds showed
obvious effects against damage induced by serum deprivation
(-B27), and three compounds (18, 30 and 31) possessed more
potent activity than 7 at 10 mM. The best active compound, which
was compound 30, exhibited 25.9% neuroprotection at 10 mM.
3.4. Detection of related protein expression in neuroprotection
HO-1 expression is induced by oxidative stress, which may be
compromised by cerebral ischemia, and in animal models,
increasing the HO-1 expression is neuroprotective [31]. SODs are
enzymes that alternately catalyze the dismutation of the toxic superoxide radical (O
2 ) into either ordinary molecular oxygen (O2) or
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) [32], which serves an important antioxidant role in neuronal injury. GSH is a key neuroprotective
molecule in the brain. The strategy for increasing the neuronal GSH
level is a promising approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [33]. These neuroprotective factors play key roles in
the prevention of neurological damage, and their expression levels
in vitro under the action of compounds 18 and 30 are displayed in
Figs. 3 and 4. The results showed that these two compounds
induced HO-1 protein expression effectively in a dose-dependent
manner and increased the SOD and GSH levels in primary neurons at 10 mM. These ﬁndings indicated that the increases in HO-1,
SOD and GSH expression levels were important ways for the neuroprotection of our synthetic tricyclic diterpene compounds.
3.5. In vitro bloodebrain barrier permeation assay
The ability to penetrate the bloodebrain barrier (BBB) is
important for the effectiveness of CNS drugs. To explore whether
these synthetic ditepenoids could enter the brain, we used a parallel artiﬁcial membrane permeation assay for the bloodebrain
barrier (PAMPA-BBB) [34]. The in vitro permeability (Pe) of the
tested compounds 7, 13, 18, 25, 30 and 31 and the control drugs
verapamil, clonidine and atenolol through a lipid extract of porcine
brain was determined using PBS as the solvent. According to the
results, we established that compounds with a Pe above
4.0  106 cm S1could penetrate into the CNS by passive diffusion
(CNSþ), whereas compounds with Pe below 2.0  106 cm S1could
not enter (CNS-). Given a Pe from 4.0 to 2.0  106 cm S1, the CNS
permeation was considered to be uncertain (CNS±). From the results in Table 4 (except compounds 13 which was not determined

because of the undetectable optical density of the reference solution), the majority of the target compounds would be able to cross
the BBB, and compounds 7, 18 and 31 in particular exhibited greater
permeation.
3.6. In vitro cytotoxicity study
One of the major hindrances in developing compounds into
drugs that provide effective neuroprotection is their toxicity to
normal cells. Thus, it is important to measure the cytotoxicity of
novel neuroprotective agents in drug discovery. Compounds 7, 13,
18, 25, 30 and 31 were tested for their cytotoxic activity in primary
rat cerebellar granule neuronal cells by MTT assay. The cytotoxicity
results of these compounds are summarized in Fig. 5. As shown in
the ﬁgure, these tested compounds showed no obvious cytotoxicity
at concentrations blow 10 mM, and compounds 13, 18, 30 and 31
showed a little cytotoxicity at high concentrations (50 and 100 mM),
especially compounds 30 and 31. However, there was no obvious
toxicity observed in tMCAO rats treated with compound 30 (10 mg/
kg dose).
3.7. In vivo anti-ischemic activity
Owing to its good cellular activity, compound 30 was chosen for
in vivo evaluation in the animal brain ischemic model. The widely
accepted tMCAO stroke model was used in this study [35]. To mimic
the clinical situation of patients with acute strokes, we used a postischemia administration by employing a 10 mg/kg dose, as
described in the Experimental section. When the rats were ﬁrst
treated at 2 h post-ischemia induction, followed by the administration of 4 h and 6 h post-ischemia induction, as shown in Fig. 6,
compound 30 signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volume by 44% and
ameliorated the neurological deﬁcit, similar to the positive control
Edaravone. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the infarct size,
and the neurological deﬁcit between vehicle-treated and salinetreated rats (data not shown) ruled out the protective effect of
the vehicle.
3.8. In vivo detection of GSH and SOD
Reactive oxygen species production is usually involved in the
pathological process of ischemia and ischemia-induced brain
neuronal injury. The antioxidant system in the brain contains the
oxidant scavenger GSH and the antioxidant enzyme SOD. At 24 h of
MCAO, the GSH concentration and SOD activity in the ipsilateral
cortex of rats were also measured to investigate the effects of
compound 30 on the anti-oxidant ability in ischemic rats. As shown
in Fig. 7, the brain ischemia markedly decreased the GSH concentration and SOD activity in the ipsilateral cortex, and compound 30

signiﬁcantly increased the GSH content and SOD activity, which
was similar to the action of Edaravone. These ﬁndings were
consistent with the results of the previous in vitro studies in
neurons.

These ﬁndings imply that these synthetic novel tricyclic diterpene derivatives may protect neurons against oxidative stress that
was induced by brain ischemia through the induction of endogenous antioxidant systems. The key proteins regulating cellular

antioxidant systems, such as Nrf2, HO-1, may be the targets for our
tested compounds, and whether these compounds antagonize
glutamate receptors to exhibit neuroprotective effects, needs to be
investigated. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are needed to
clarify the molecular mechanisms of their neuroprotective roles in
detail. All the in vivo studies with compound 30 indicated that
these tricyclic diterpene derivatives that were used as novel neuroprotective agents can penetrate the BBB effectively and may have
beneﬁcial effects when treating for brain ischemic stroke related to
oxidative damage.
4. Conclusion
We synthesized over 20 new tricyclic diterpene derivatives and
evaluated their neuroprotective effects against glutamate-, OGDand nutrient deprivation-induced injury in primary neurons. These
derivatives exhibited good neuroprotective effects and no cellular
toxicity. Among them, compounds 18 and 30 exhibited potent
neuroprotective activity. The in vitro detection of related protein
expression in terms of neuroprotection showed that the levels of
HO-1, SOD and GSH expression were promoted by these two
compounds. According to the PAMPA-BBB assay, most of these
derivatives would be able to cross the BBB with great permeability.
The most promising compound, which was compound 30, was
chosen for the in vivo evaluation of anti-ischemic activity and
exhibited neuroprotection in rats with MCAO by reducing the
infarct size and neurological deﬁcit scores. In addition, further
mechanistic studies with 30 showed that during the pathological
process of ischemia-induced brain neuronal injury, this compound
improved the expression levels of SOD and GSH in the cortex of rats
with MCAO, which was consistent with the in vitro experiments.
In conclusion, we are the ﬁrst to report on the use of synthetic
tricyclic diterpene derivatives as a series of new chemical entities
with a potential neuroprotective role. In particular, compound 30,
which exhibited potent neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo, could
be used as a promising lead for the development of a new class of
neuroprotective agents against ischemic brain injury.
5. Experimental section
5.1. General
All reagents and chemicals were purchased from commercial
suppliers and used without further puriﬁcation unless otherwise
stated. When needed, the reactions were carried out in ﬂame or
oven-dried glassware under a positive pressure of dry N2. Column
chromatography was performed on silica gel (QinDao, 200e300
mesh) using the indicated eluents. Thin-layer chromatography was
carried out on silica gel plates (QinDao) with a layer thickness of
0.25 mm. Melting points were determined using the MEL-TEMP 3.0
apparatus and uncorrected. 1H (300, 400 and 500 MHz) and 13C
(100 and 125 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on Varian Mercury300, Bruker AM-400 and Bruker AV-500 spectrometer with CDCl3
or DMSO-d6 as solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal
standard. All chemical shift values were reported in units of
d (ppm). The following abbreviations were used to indicate the
peak multiplicity: s ¼ singlet; d ¼ doublet; t ¼ triplet;
m ¼ multiplet; br ¼ broad. High-resolution mass data were obtained on a BrukermicroOTOF-Q II spectrometer. Purity of all ﬁnal
tricyclic diterpene derivatives for biological testing was conﬁrmed
to be >95% as determined by HPLC analysis (for data, see
Supporting Information). HPLC analysis was conducted according
to the following method with the retention time expressed in min
at UV detection of 254 nm. For HPLC method, an Agilent 1200 series
HPLC instrument was used, with chromatography performed on a

403

ZORBAX 150 mm  4.6 mm, 5 mm C18 column with mobile phase
gradient of 10e60% H2O in MeOH or 10e60% H2O in MeOH (contain
0.5% CF3COOH), with a ﬂow rate of 1.5 mL/min.

To a solution of 6 (60 mg, 0.2 mmol) in alcohols (10 mL) was
added H2SO4 (10 drops) under N2. The reaction mixture was heated
under reﬂux for 3 h. After cooling, the reaction mixture was poured
into saturated NaHCO3 (20 mL) and extracted with EtOAc
(10 mL  3). The organic layer was washed with brine, dried with
anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated. The residue was puriﬁed by
silica gel chromatography (petroleum ether/EtOAc, 3/1 v/v) to
afford the desired product.

5.13. Biological assay
Cell culture medium and supplements were obtained from
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Glutamate was purchased from
SigmaeAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Primary antibodies used for
Western blot analysis were: rabbit anti-HO-1 (1:500), mouse antib-actin (1:1000), all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Company
(Danvers, MA, USA). Secondary antibodies for Western blot analysis
were: goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, AmershamBioSciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA); goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). SuperSignal West Dura Substrate for
chemiluminescent detection was purchased from Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc (Pittsburg, PA, USA). The cell lysis buffer, protease inhibitor cocktail, BCA-based protein quantiﬁcation kit, the SOD and GSH
assay kit were obtained from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology
(Shanghai, China). All other chemicals were obtained from SigmaeAldrich unless otherwise stated.
5.13.1. Primary rat cerebellar granule neuron cultures
Cerebellar granule neuronal cells (CGCs) were isolated from 8day old Sprague Dawley rat pups as described previously [36].
Cerebella were collected and placed in ice-cold Hank's balanced salt
solution (HBSS) (Invitrogen). After removal of the meninges, the
cerebellas were dispersed into the same buffer containing 0.25%
trypsin (Invitrogen) and digested for 15 min at 37  C. Trypsin
digestion was stopped by adding a two-fold volume of DMEM
(Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 0.1 mg/
ml DNase I (SigmaeAldrich). After gentle trituration, digested tissues were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets were
resuspended in the complete Neurobasal culture medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mMGlutaMax (Invitrogen). After ﬁltration through 70 mm cell strainer (BD
Falcon, Vernon Hills, IL, USA), cells were plated at a density of
1  106 cells/ml onto poly-L-lysine coated 96-well or 6-well plates
(Becton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Cultures
were incubated in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air at
37  C. Cytosine arabinofuranoside (10 mM) was added to the cultures 24 h after plating to arrest the growth of glia cells. Cultures
6e8 days in vitro were used in this study. Immunocytochemical
validation with anti-MAP2 antibody and DAPI revealed that more
than 95% of the cells in our cultures system were neurons at the
time of experiment.
5.13.2. Oxygeneglucose deprivation (OGD)
When CGCs were cultured at DIV 6, the complete medium was
removed and the cells were washed with a glucose-free Earle's
balanced salt solution (EBSS, pH 7.4). Then the cultures were placed
in fresh glucose-free EBSS and transferred to a hypoxia chamber
containing a mixture of 95% N2 and 5% CO2 at 37  C for 6 h. After
OGD, the glucose was added to attain a ﬁnal concentration of
4.5 mg/ml, followed by incubation for additional 24 h in normal
conditions with 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37  C. Compounds at indicated concentrations were added into the cultures 24 h before OGD
treatment. Control cells without OGD and reoxygenation were

Y.-Y. Wang et al. / European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 103 (2015) 396e408

maintained in the incubator under normal conditions and used for
viability experiment.
5.13.3. Cell viability assay by MTT method
The CGCs were pretreated with compounds at indicated concentrations for 24 h and then incubated with 100 mM glutamate or
without nutrient B27 for another 24 h, or under OGD condition. All
compounds were dissolved in DMSO. DMSO was present in all
samples at a ﬁnal 0.1% concentration in the culture medium, which
had no neuroprotective effect in above biological assays.
Cell viability was evaluated by incubating with 0.5 mg/ml 3[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide
(MTT) for 4 h under 5% CO2/95% air at 37  C. Active mitochondrial
dehydrogenases of living cells cause cleavage and reduction of
soluble yellow MTT dye to the insoluble purple formazan, which
was extracted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Media were replaced
with 100 mL DMSO, and the optical density was measured at 570 nm
in a BD plate-reader.
5.13.4. Western blotting
To determine HO-1 blots, primary neurons or brain cortex
samples were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Vazyme, Jiangsu, China).
Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 20 min and
tissue samples homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for
5 min. Total protein concentration of the supernatants was assessed
by BCA kit (Thermo, Rockford, IL). The equal amounts of the
extracted proteins were separated by electrophoresis on 15% SDSPAGE gels, and then transferred onto PVDF membranes. The
membranes were blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h and then incubated
overnight at 4  C with the primary antibody followed by washing
and exposure to the secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. b-actin was used as a loading control for all samples. The
membranes were exposed to SuperSignal West Dura Substrate kit
for chemiluminescent detection.
5.13.5. Measurements of SOD and GSH
The CGCs were pretreated with compounds at indicated concentrations for 24 h and then incubated with 100 mM glutamate.
After 24 h of glutamate incubation, the cells were lysed by a lysis
buffer consisting of a protease inhibitor cocktail. After 24 h of
ischemia, the rat brain cortices were lysed by a RIPA lysis buffer. The
extracted protein from cell lysates or brain cortex homogenates was
quantiﬁed by BCA method, and then subjected to the measurement
of SOD and GSH, respectively. The SOD activity and the GSH concentration were determined using the SOD assay kit and the GSH
assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions, respectively.
5.13.6. In vitro bloodebrain barrier permeability assay
The ability to cross the BBB was predicted and evaluated using
PAMPA [37]. Tested compounds were dissolved in DMSO at 5 mg/ml
as stock solutions. A 10 mL sample of stock solution was diluted in
PBS to make a secondary stock solution (ﬁnal concentration 25 mg/
ml). These solutions were ﬁltered. A 300 mL sample of secondary
stock solution was added to the donor well. The porcine polar brain
lipid was dissolved in dodecane at 20 mg/ml. The ﬁlter membrane
was coated with 4 mL of porcine polar brain lipid solution, and the
acceptor well was ﬁlled with 150 mL of PBS. The acceptor ﬁlter plate
was carefully put on the donor plate to form a “sandwich” which
was composed of the donor with tested compounds on the bottom,
artiﬁcial lipid membrane in the middle, and the acceptor on the top.
The sandwich was incubated undisturbed at room temperature for
18 h. The donor plate was removed after incubation. The concentrations of tested compounds in the acceptor and reference solutions were determined by a UV plate reader. Reference solutions
were prepared by diluting the sample secondary stock solution to

407

the same concentration as that with no membrane barrier. Every
sample was analyzed at three wavelengths, in three wells, and in
three independent runs.
5.13.7. Animals
Adult male SpragueeDawley (SD) rats weighing 260e280 g
were purchased from Zhejiang Laboratory Animals Center (Hangzhou, China) and kept under standard housing conditions at a
temperature between 20  C and 23  C, with a 12 h lightedark cycle
and a relative humidity of 50%. Animal housing and handling were
carried out in accordance with the US National Institute of Health
(NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published
by the US National Academy of Sciences (http://oacu.od.nih.gov/
regs/index.htm). All animal tests and experimental procedures
were approved by the Administration Committee of Experimental
Animals in Jiangsu Province and the Ethics Committee of China
Pharmaceutical University.
5.13.8. Focal cerebral ischemia procedure
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was performed as reported previously [35]. The external carotid artery was
isolated and coagulated, a monoﬁlament nylon suture (diameter of
approximately 0.26 mm) with a round tip was inserted into the
internal carotid artery through the external carotid artery stump,
occluding the middle cerebral artery for 2 h. After occlusion, the
animals were reanesthetized and the ﬁlament was withdrawn to
restore blood ﬂow. Body temperature was regulated at 37  C with a
temperature control system. All animals had free access to food and
water.
5.13.9. Drug delivery paradigm
Animals were randomly divided into ﬁve groups, such as Sham,
Vehicle (DMSO or saline), compound 30 and Edaravone as a positive control groups, respectively. In order to mimic clinical situations, rats were intravenously treated with compound 30
(dissolved in DMSO, 10 mg/kg) or Edaravone (dissolved in saline,
3 mg/kg) at 2 h, 4 h and 6 h after ischemia onset [38]. Rats intravenously injected with DMSO or saline were taken as a control
(Vehicle group), showing similar ischemic effects.
5.13.10. Assessment of cerebral infarct volume and neurological
deﬁcit
Animals were carried with neurological scoring at 24 h after
MCAO followed by euthanization, then brains were harvested and
sectioned into 2 mm coronal sections. Sections were inspected for
the presence of macroscopic intracranial hemorrhage, then stained
with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) for 20 min at
37  C, ﬁxed with 10% formalin, and evaluated for infarct size by
morphometric analysis (image-pro plus) as described [35]. Total
infarct volume was expressed as a percentage of the volume of the
all sectional area to the lesion. The neurological scores were evaluated 24 h after the MCAO using a scoring system as previously
reported [34].
5.13.11. Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using GraphPad Prism 5
Software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Multiple group
comparisons were performed by one-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni posttest. Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. Values are expressed as the mean ± SD.
