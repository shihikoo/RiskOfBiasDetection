induces apoptosis in hippocampus through
downregulating PI3K/Akt and upregulating p38 MAPK
signaling pathways

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a calcium-permeable cation channel that is sensitive to cell swelling, arachidonic
acid and its metabolites, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, which are associated with cerebral ischemia. The activation of TRPV4 induces
cytotoxicity in many types of cells, accompanied by an increase in the intracellular free calcium concentration. TRPV4 activation
modulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/ protein kinase B (Akt) signaling
pathways that regulate cell death and survival. Herein, we examined TRPV4-induced neuronal apoptosis by intracerebroventricular
(ICV) injection of a TRPV4 agonist (GSK1016790A) and assessed its involvement in cerebral ischemic injury. ICV injection of
GSK1016790A dose-dependently induced apoptosis in the mouse hippocampi (GSK-injected mice). The protein level of
phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK) was markedly increased and that of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase
(p-JNK) was virtually unchanged. TRPV4 activation also decreased Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio and increased the cleaved caspase-3
protein level, and these effects were blocked by a PI3K agonist and a p38 MAPK antagonist, but were unaffected by a JNK
antagonist. ICV injection of the TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047 reduced brain infarction after reperfusion for 48 h in mice with middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In addition, HC-067047 treatment attenuated the decrease in the phosphorylated Akt protein
level and the increase in p-p38 MAPK protein level at 48 h after MCAO, while the increase in p-JNK protein level remained
unchanged. Finally, the decreased Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio and the increased cleaved caspase-3 protein level at 48 h after MCAO
were markedly attenuated by HC-067047. We conclude that activation of TRPV4 induces apoptosis by downregulating PI3K/Akt and
upregulating p38 MAPK signaling pathways, which is involved in cerebral ischemic injury.

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a member of
the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily, is permeable to calcium (Ca2+).1 TRPV4 was first described as a
cellular osmotic sensor that detects hypotonic stimulation, and
it has now been proven to be activated by multiple stimuli,
including mild heat, mechanical stimulation, arachidonic acid
(AA) and its metabolites, and exogenous chemical ligands.2
TRPV4 is widely expressed in the nervous system and other
tissues, including the lungs, bladder and skin.1 In the central
nervous system, TRPV4 is present in neurons and glial
cells.3,4 It mediates infrasound- and beta amyloid peptideinduced neuronal impairment, accompanied by an increase
in the intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i).5,6
Application of a TRPV4 agonist dose-dependently induces
hippocampal neuronal death in vivo.7 Additionally, a gain-offunction mutant of TRPV4 has been shown to augment Ca2+
entry and decrease cell viability in transfected HEK293 cells.8
TRPV4 can be activated by cell swelling-induced mechanical

stimulation and metabolites of AA that are always associated
with cerebral ischemia. The protein level of TRPV4 has been
reported to increase with ongoing reperfusion in a mouse
model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).7
Therefore, the over- or hyper-activation of TRPV4 is likely
during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Blocking of TRPV4 has
been shown to exert neuroprotective effects against cerebral
ischemic injury in both in vitro and in vivo studies.7,9–11
Targeting of TRPV4 is attracting more and more attention in
the treatment of cerebral ischemia.
Cell apoptosis, which is one of the major causes of cerebral
ischemic injury, becomes prominent after reperfusion for
24–72 h.12 It has been reported that excessive Ca2+ entry
through TRPV4 leads to apoptosis in mouse retinal ganglion
cells, which may be due to the activation of Ca2+-dependent
pro-apoptotic signaling pathways.13 Mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways that are involved in
cerebral ischemic injury have important roles in regulating

cell death and survival through signal translocation pathways
related to apoptosis.14 The activation of phosphatidyl inositol 3kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling has been reported
to inhibit caspase-dependent apoptosis in cultured neurons and
a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.15–17 Activation of
TRPV4 can modulate MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways
in different types of cells.7,18 In this study, we first assessed the
effect of TRPV4 activation on neuronal apoptosis in the
hippocampus and then explored the mechanisms underlying
TRPV4 action. Finally, we examined the involvement of TRPV4induced apoptosis in MCAO in mice.
Results
Effect of TRPV4 agonist on apoptosis in hippocampus.
In this study, we first examined whether the activation of TRPV4
induces apoptosis in the hippocampus by administering
intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of different doses of
the TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A (GSK-injected mice). The
number of Hoechst+ cells in the hippocampal CA1 area was
4.85 ± 2.17 /mm in the control group, which is consistent with a
previous report.19 Figure 1a shows that more Hoechst+ cells
were detected after the mice were injected with GSK1016790A
(1 μM/mouse) compared with the control value. Moreover,
at doses ranging from 0.1 μM/mouse to 5 μM/mouse,
GSK1016790A-induced apoptosis was dose dependent, with
EC50 values being 1.21 ± 0.24 μM/mouse (Figures 1b and c).
These results provide in vivo evidence that the over-activation
of TRPV4 may result in apoptosis in the hippocampus. In the
presence of 1 μM/mouse GSK1016790A, the number of
Hoechst+ cells in the hippocampal CA1 area was increased
by 80.67 ± 1.16% (Po0.01), and this dose was used in the
following experiments.
Effect of TRPV4 agonist on the expression of apoptosisrelated signaling pathways and apoptosis-related
proteins. Among the three MAPK signaling pathways, the

p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK)
signaling pathways have been implicated in apoptosis in
response to stress or some pathological conditions, such as
cerebral ischemia.14 Modulation of the MAPK signaling
pathway by TRPV4 activation has been previously
reported.7,18 Figures 2a and b show that an increase in
phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK) protein level was
found in the GSK-injected mice, whereas the protein level of
phosphorylated JNK1/2 (p-JNK1/2) was nearly unchanged.
These results indicate that activation of TRPV4 may enhance
the activation of p38 MAPK signaling pathway.
Here, we examined the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in the
GSK-injected mice. Although the protein levels of Bcl-2
(Figure 2c) and Bax (Figure 2d) were higher in the GSKinjected mice, the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio was significantly
decreased after GSK1016790A treatment (Po0.01)
(Figure 2f). In addition, the activation of caspase-3, which is
an important mediator of apoptosis, was also assessed. As
shown in Figure 2e, a significant increase in the cleaved
caspase-3 protein level was found in the GSK-injected mice
compared with that in the control mice (Po0.01). In our recent
study, activation of TRPV4 has been shown to downregulate
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which is involved in TRPV4induced neurotoxicity.7 Here, it was determined that the
decrease in Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio and the increase in the
cleaved caspase-3 protein level were markedly rescued in
the GSK-injected mice co-injected with 740 Y-P (a PI3K
agonist) or SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor). The change in
Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio or in the cleaved caspase-3 protein
level in the GSK-injected mice was nearly unaffected by
treatment with SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) (Figures 2f and g).
These results imply that activation of TRPV4 may negatively
shift Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio and facilitate the activation of
caspase-3 protein, which may be related to the inhibited
PI3K/Akt and the increased p38 MAPK signaling pathways.

Involvement of signaling pathways in TRPV4-induced
apoptosis in hippocampus. As shown in Figure 3, there
were fewer Hoechst+ cells in the GSK-injected mice
co-injected with 740 Y-P or SB203580 (Po0.01 in each
case). Additionally, fewer Hoechst+ cells were found in the
mice co-injected with GSK1016790A and Ac-DEVD-CHO
(a caspase-3 inhibitor) (Po0.01). By contrast, the number of
Hoechst+ cells in the GSK-injected mice was almost the
same as that in the mice co-injected with GSK1016790A and
SP600125. Combined with the above results, it is suggested
that activation of TRPV4 may downregulate PI3K/Akt and
upregulate p38 MAPK signaling pathways to decrease Bcl-2/
Bax protein ratio subsequently and to activate caspase-3 at
last, which is likely responsible for TRPV4-induced apoptosis.

Effect of TRPV4 antagonist on brain infarction and
changes in the protein levels of p-p38 MAPK, p-Akt
and p-JNK at 48 h post MCAO. Cell apoptosis is evident at
24–72 h during ischemia-reperfusion.12 Here, we examined the
effect of a TRPV4 antagonist on brain infarction at 48 h post
MCAO. Figure 4a shows that the brain infarction volume was
46.67 ± 3.14% in the MCAO mice at 48 h post MCAO. After the
MCAO mice were treated with HC-067047, the brain
infarction volume was only 12.59 ± 1.46% (Po0.01). Here,
more Hoechst+ cells were found at 48 h post MCAO
(237.01 ± 15.03%) and this change was markedly blocked
following treatment with HC-067047 (145.11 ± 19.21%)
(Po0.01) (Figure 4b). Therefore, it is likely that the apoptosis
caused by TRPV4 activation likely contributes, at least in part,
to the neuronal injury on the condition of cerebral ischemia.

We also found that the protein levels of p-p38 MAPK
(Figure 5a) and p-JNK (Figure 5b) were markedly increased
and that of p-Akt (Figure 5c) was decreased significantly at

48 h post MCAO. Notably, after the MCAO mice were treated
with HC-067047, the increase in p-p38 MAPK protein level and
the decrease in p-Akt protein level were obviously rescued,

ratio and the increase in the cleaved caspase-3 protein level in
the MCAO mice were markedly attenuated by HC-067047
treatment (Figures 5d and g). These results indicate that
during the cerebral ischemia, the activation of TRPV4
probably downregulates PI3K/Akt and upregulates p38 MAPK
signaling pathways to decrease the Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio and
activate caspase-3.
Discussion
TRPV4 is sensitive to various types of stimuli, including
hypoosmotic stimulation, mechanical force, the metabolism of

AA and synthetic ligands. It is a calcium-permeable channel,
and a TRPV4-induced increase in [Ca2+]i has been confirmed
by many research groups.1,2 Increasing evidence of TRPV4
activation-related cellular toxicity is emerging. For example,
sustained exposure to TRPV4 agonists has been shown to
evoke the dose-dependent apoptosis of retinal ganglion
cells, accompanied by an elevation in [Ca2+]i.13 TRPV4 has
been demonstrated to be involved in human islet amyloid
polypeptide-triggered apoptosis in a mouse pancreatic
beta cell line and to be responsible for infrasound-induced
apoptosis in the hippocampus.5,20 A TRPV4 mutation displaying an increase in calcium channel activity results in increased
cytotoxicity.8,21 Consistent with our recent report concerning

TRPV4-induced neuronal injury,7 the present data showed
that application of a TRPV4 agonist dose-dependently
induced apoptosis in the hippocampus (Figure 1), further
demonstrating the neuronal cytotoxicity caused by TRPV4
activation.
Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death, which is an
initiative suicide process that occurs after cells receive a signal
or stimulation. MAPKs are a family of serine/threonine protein
kinases that are critical for the transduction of signals from the
cell surface to the nucleus. Among the members of the MAPK
family, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) is
mainly responsible for the control of growth and differentiation,
and the other two MAPK family members, JNK and p38, have
roles in apoptosis as well as in inflammation, growth and
differentiation.22 Akt has an important role in the suppression
of apoptosis. After Akt is phosphorylated by PI3K, it can inhibit
cell death by inactivating apoptogenic factors.23 It has been
reported that Akt signaling pathway may be inhibited by the
treatment with a TRPV4 agonist, and ERK signaling pathway
may be activated by TRPV4 activation.7,18 However, blockage
of ERK pathway fails to attenuate TRPV4-induced hippocampal neuronal death.7 Therefore, the present study focused on
exploring the involvement of Akt, JNK and p38 MAPK
pathways in TRPV4-induced apoptosis. First, our data found
that the protein level of p-p38 MAPK increased markedly,
whereas that of p-JNK remained nearly unchanged in the
GSK-injected mice (Figures 2a and b), indicating that
activation of TRPV4 selectively activates p38 MAPK signaling
pathway. Second, in the presence of a PI3K agonist (740 Y-P)
or a p38 MAPK antagonist (SB203580), GSK1016790Ainduced apoptosis was significantly attenuated. By contrast,
the apoptosis caused by TRPV4 activation was unaffected by
a JNK antagonist (SP600125) (Figure 3). These results
indicate that the inhibition of PI3K/Akt and the increase in
p38 MAPK signaling pathways are responsible for TRPV4
activation-induced apoptosis.
Bcl-2 family proteins are key regulators of apoptosis and
include both anti-apoptotic members, such as Bcl-2, and proapoptotic members, such as Bax.23,24 Here, the protein level of
Bax was increased to a greater extent compared with that of
Bcl-2 in the GSK-injected mice, leading to a decrease in Bcl-2/
Bax protein ratio (Figures 2d and f). Caspases are a family of
intracellular proteins that are involved in the initiation and
execution of cell apoptosis. Caspase-3 is a potent, terminal
caspase that executes apoptosis via a mitochondrialdependent pathway.25 The present study showed an increase
in the cleaved caspase-3 protein level in the GSK-injected
mice, and fewer Hoechst+ cells were found in mice co-injected
with GSK1016790A and caspase-3 inhibitor (Ac-DEVDCHO), indicating that TRPV4-induced apoptosis is caspase3 dependent (Figures 2e and 3). The above results indicate
that activation of TRPV4 may result in a negative shift in the
dynamic balance of the Bcl-2 family and ultimately activate
caspase-3 that executes the apoptosis. Here, the decrease in
Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio and the increase in the cleaved
casapse-3 protein level in the GSK-injected mice were
markedly attenuated by a PI3K agonist and a p38 MAPK
antagonist (Figure 2g). Collectively, our data suggest that the
over-activation of TRPV4 may inhibit PI3K/Akt and enhance
p38 MAPK signaling pathways to negatively shift Bcl-2/Bax
Cell Death and Disease

protein ratio and to ultimately activate caspase-3, which is
probably involved in TRPV4-induced apoptosis.
There is increasing evidence that TRPV4 is a promising
target for the treatment of cerebral ischemia. First, pathological changes that occur during ischemia/reperfusion, including
cytotoxic cell swelling and disturbances in membrane lipid
metabolism may facilitate the activation of TRPV4. Second,
the protein level of TRPV4 increases with ongoing ischemiareperfusion. Third, blocking TRPV4 has been proven to have
protective effects on neurons following oxygen-glucose
deprivation treatment or in rodent models of acute cerebral
ischemia.6,7,9–11 Cell apoptosis is one of the major causes of
cerebral ischemic injury, and it may be mediated through
MAPK signaling pathways.14 The present study showed that
application of a TRPV4 antagonist reduced brain infarction
and apoptosis at 48 h post MCAO (Figure 4), indicating that
TRPV4-induced apoptosis is likely involved in the cerebral
ischemic injury. Here, the increase in p-p38 MAPK and the
decrease in p-Akt protein levels in the MCAO mice were
markedly rescued by HC-067047. Additionally, the decrease
in Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio and the increase in the cleaved
caspase-3 protein level in the MCAO mice were significantly
inhibited following HC-067047 treatment (Figure 5). In summary,
it is proposed that during the cerebral ischemia, the overactivation of TRPV4 results in caspase-3-dependent apoptosis
through inhibiting PI3K/Akt and enhancing p38 MAPK signaling pathways, and this action contributes to cerebral ischemic
neuronal injury.
The present study was a subsequent work of our previous
report in which activation of TRPV4 shows neurotoxicity
through enhancing the NR2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptor and the related downregulation of Akt signaling
pathway and thus is involved in the cerebral ischemic injury.7
In the previous study, we have proven that Akt but not ERK
signaling pathway is selectively responsible for TRPV4induced neuronal injury, providing a basis for further exploring
the role of Akt signaling in TRPV4-induced apoptosis. In this
study, p38 MAPK signaling was also confirmed to be
responsible for TRPV4-induced apoptosis, whereas the
involvement of JNK signaling was excluded. Furthermore,
the inhibition of PI3K/Akt and the increase in p38 MAPK
signalings were implicated in TRPV4-modulated apoptosisrelated protein expression, including Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved
caspase-3. In our previous study, brain infarction at 24 h post
MCAO is reduced by TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047. Cell
apoptosis becomes prominent after reperfusion for 24–72 h
following cerebral ischemia;12 therefore, we examined the
effect of HC-067047 on brain infarction and apoptosis at 48 h
post MCAO in this study. Different time point post-MCAO
chosen to study the effect of HC-067047 in cerebral ischemic
injury was due to the different research objective in our
previous study and the present one.
TRPV4 is widely expressed in the nervous system. Given its
sensitivity to diverse stimuli and permeability to calcium,
TRPV4 may have an important role in modulating the function
of the nervous system under physiological and pathological
conditions. In addition to its involvement in cerebral ischemic
injury, the potential role of TRPV4-induced neurotoxicity has
been reported in AD and motor neuron disease.6,8,26 An
increase in TRPV4 expression has been found in the brains of

aged rats.3 Therefore, targeting of TRPV4 provides a promising
neuroprotective treatment.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Male mice (ICR, Oriental Bio Service Inc., Nanjing, China) weighing
25–30 g were used in this study. The animals were housed under a 12:12-h light/
dark cycle and were provided food and water ad libitum. All animal experiments
were approved by the animal experimental committee of Nanjing Medical University,
China. Each experimental group contained nine mice.
Drug treatment. All drugs were intracerebroventricularly injected as previously
reported.7 After the mice were anesthetized with 2% chloral hydrate (20 ml/kg), they
were placed in a stereotaxic device (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). A 23-G
stainless-steel guide cannula (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA, USA) was inserted into the
right lateral ventricle (0.3 mm posterior, 1.0 mm lateral, and 2.5 mm ventral to the
bregma) and anchored to the skull with four stainless steel screws and dental cement.
Drugs were injected using a 26-G stainless-steel needle (Plastics One). The drugs
were first dissolved in DMSO and then in 0.9% saline to a final volume of 2 μl with a
final DMSO concentration being 1%. SB203580 (1 mM/mouse), SP600125 (10 μg/
mouse), 740 Y-P (30 μM/mouse) or Ac-DEVD-CHO (10 μM/mouse) was injected
30 min before GSK1016790A injection and subsequently injected once daily for 3 days.
The doses of the above antagonists or agonists were chosen as previously
described.10,27–30 The TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047 was used as previously reported,
except that it was repeatedly injected until 48 h post MCAO.10
Preparation of the focal cerebral ischemia model. Transient focal
cerebral ischemia was induced by MCAO as previously described.7 Briefly, after the
mice were anesthetized, the right common carotid artery, external carotid artery (ECA)
and internal carotid artery (ICA) were separated and exposed. The origin of the middle
cerebral artery was occluded by a poly-L-lysine-coated nylon monofilament thread,
which was inserted through the ECA and advanced into the ICA. Reperfusion was
established by withdrawing the thread after 60 min of occlusion. The adequacy of
vascular occlusion and reperfusion in the front parietal cortex of the occluded side was
monitored using a multichannel laser Doppler flowmeter (Perimed PF5050, Jarfalla,
Sweden). Body and head temperatures were thermostatically controlled and arterial
blood pressure and gases were monitored through a femoral catheter during the
operation. Mice in the sham-operated (sham-op) group were treated identically except
for the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery.
Infarction volume measurement. Brain infarction was determined using
2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining as previously described.10 The
brains were removed at 48 h post MCAO, sectioned into 2-mm-thick coronal slices
and then incubated with a 2% TTC solution for 20 min. Brain infarction was
visualized with image analysis software (MCID; Imaging Research, Canada), and
infarct volume was determined as a percentage of the infarct area relative to the
contralateral hemisphere area for each slice.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed at 48 h post
MCAO or on day 3 after GSK1016790A injection. Hippocampal protein
concentrations were determined with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rochford,
IL, USA). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were
blocked using nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/Tween-20 and then incubated
with antibodies against phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK, 1:1000, Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA), p38 MAPK (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology,
Boston, MA, USA), phospho-JNK1/2 (p-JNK1/2, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology,
Boston, MA, USA), JNK1/2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA),
cleaved caspase-3 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA),
caspase-3 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), Bax (1:1000,
Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA), Bcl-2 (1:1000, Cell Signaling
Technology, Boston, MA, USA) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) (1:5000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at 4 °C overnight. After being
washed with TBST, the membranes were incubated with an HRP-labeled secondary
antibody, developed using an ECL Detection Kit (Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ, USA) and analyzed using Image J software (NIH). Hippocampal
samples collected from the hemispheres of three mice were considered a set for
western blot analysis. The summarized data represent the average of three
experimental sets.

Hoechst staining. On day 3 after GSK1016790A injection or at 48 h post
MCAO, mice were anesthetized and perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed and
immersed in fixative (4 °C overnight) and then processed for paraffin-embedding.
Coronal sections (5 μm) cut from the level of the hippocampus were stained with
Hoechst-33342. Hoechst-positive (Hoechst+) cells were counted using a fluoresce
microscope (Olympus PD70) (×40 objective). Hoechst+ cells were counted in six
sections per mouse and expressed as the number of cells per millimeter of length
along the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer.19
Data analysis. Data are expressed as means ± S.E.M. and were analyzed with
Stata 7.0 software (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). ANOVA followed
by Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used for statistical analysis, and significance levels
were set at Po0.05 and Po0.01. The number of the Hoechst+ cells or the protein
level in the mice that were injected with GSK1016790A or/and kinase agonist/
antagonist was expressed as a percentage of that in the vehicle-injected mice
(control mice). The number of the Hoechst+ cells or the protein level in the MCAO
mice or the MCAO mice treated with HC-067047 was expressed as a percentage of
that in the sham-op mice. The increases in the number of Hoechst+ cells resulting
from different doses of GSK1016790A were first normalized to the increase caused
by 5 μM GSK1016790A. The dose-response curve was then fitted by the Hill
equation, in which a = amax/[1+(EC50/C)n], with n being the Hill coefficient, and EC50
being the dose of GSK1016790A producing 50% effect.
