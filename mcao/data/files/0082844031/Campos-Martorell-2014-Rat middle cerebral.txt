Abstract
Background: Infections related to stroke-induced immunodepression are an important complication causing a high rate of
death in patients. Several experimental studies in mouse stroke models have described this process but it has never been
tested in other species such as rats.
Methods: Our study focused on the appearance of secondary systemic and pulmonary infections in ischemic rats,
comparing with sham and naive animals. For that purpose, male Wistar rats were subjected to embolic middle cerebral
artery occlusion (eMCAO) or to transient MCAO (tMCAO) inserting a nylon filament. Forty-eight hours after ischemia, blood
and lung samples were evaluated.
Results: In eMCAO set, ischemic rats showed a significant decrease in blood-peripheral lymphocytes (naive = 58.8618.1%,
ischemic = 22.9616.4%) together with an increase in polymorphonuclears (PMNs) (naive = 29.2614.7%, ischemic = 71.7619.5%), while no change in monocytes was observed. The increase in PMNs counts was positively correlated
with worse neurological outcome 48 hours after eMCAO (r = 0.55, p = 0.043). However, sham animals showed similar
changes in peripheral leukocytes as those seen in ischemic rats (lymphocytes: 40.1619.7%; PMNs: 51.7619.2%). Analysis of
bacteriological lung growth showed clear differences between naive (060 CFU/mL; log10) and both sham (3.962.5 CFU/
mL; log10) and ischemic (4.362.9 CFU/mL; log10) groups. Additionally, naive animals presented non-pathological lung
histology, while both sham and ischemic showed congestion, edema or hemorrhage. Concordant results were found in the
second set of animals submitted to a tMCAO.
Conclusions: Inflammatory and infection changes in Wistar rats subjected to MCAO models may be attributed not only to
the brain ischemic injury but to the surgical aggression and/or anaesthetic stress. Consequently, we suggest that strokeinduced immunodepression in ischemic experimental models should be interpreted with caution in further experimental
and translational studies, at least in rat stroke models that entail cervicotomy and cranial trepanation.

other hand, it is well known that stroke prognosis depends on
secondary complications incidence [4], recognizing infection as an
independent risk factor for adverse outcome [3,5]. However, the
precise mechanisms by which this association operates remain
poorly understood. The incidence and prognostic impact of
infections have been recently evaluated in a meta-analysis on this
subject, which concluded that infections complicated acute stroke
in 30% of patients [3]. This high incidence on stroke patients
seems to be a result of an impaired immune function [6,7]
complicated with stroke-facilitated aspiration, due to patient

Introduction
Stroke not only produces local brain injury but also causes a
systemic inflammatory response followed by an immunodepression
process which predisposes patients to infections. This immunodepression state is thought to be induced through a sympathetic
nervous system over-action which contributes to an increase of
catecholamines and glucocortocoids [1]. Thus, the prolongation of
this immune suppression may increase the chance of infection [2],
predisposing stroke patients to pneumonia and sepsis [3]. On the

sterile PBS and lungs were carefully removed in aseptic conditions
for posterior evaluation. From the total of 26 rats submitted to
embolic MCAO and included in the study, 10 of them died before
the experimental protocol finished (eight during the first 24 hours
and two of them between 24 and 48 hours after the occlusion). No
animals died in the sham group.

dysphagia, immobilization and the need of invasive procedures
like insertion of intravenous lines and urinary catheters [8].
Pneumonia is the most common infection [3,9,10] and it is the
leading cause of death within the first 48 hours after stroke
[11,12].
Experimental studies with different animal models have been
crucial in understanding several aspects related to the physiopathology of the infection during the acute phase of stroke. Some
studies in mouse models of cerebral ischemia (suture MCAO
model) have demonstrated that nervous system damage results in
spontaneous bacterial infections because of a deterioration of cellmediated immune responses [8,13,14]. Others have shown that
when a harmless concentration of Streptococcus peumoniae is
intranasally applied, only mice with stroke shift to severe infection
[15]. However, studies of stroke-induced immunodepression and
spontaneous infections associated with brain ischemia have not
been previously reported in rats. Therefore, we aimed to study
secondary systemic and respiratory tract infections in rats using the
MCAO model induced by blood-clot administration in rats, the
model that best resembles clinical stroke [16].

Intraluminal tMCAO model
In order to ratify our findings, experiments were repeated in a
new set of rats submitted to a transient MCAO model using an
intraluminal filament as described previously [18]. In brief, after
the surgical exposure of the bifurcation of the external carotid
artery and the internal carotid artery on the right side, a siliconecoated nylon monofilament (Doccol Corporation, reference
number: 403723PK10) was introduced to occlude the MCA.
After occlusion, animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia.
Reperfusion was induced 90 minutes later and to that end, animals
were re-anaesthetized. Only animals that exhibited a reduction .
75% in regional cerebral blood flow after filament placement and
a recovery of .75% after filament removal were included in the
study. Sham-operated animals were submitted to the same
processes except for the filament introduction. Naive animals
were not submitted to any procedure and were sacrificed the same
day as ischemic and sham ones. Analgesia protocol and methods
employed for sample collection were exactly the same as the ones
used in the previous rat set submitted to an eMCAO model.
From the total of 10 rats submitted to tMCAO, two of them
were excluded due to bad reperfusion and another one died before
the experimental protocol finished. No animals died in the sham
group.

Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
All procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee
of the Vall d’Hebron Research Institute (02/09 and 58/13 CEEA)
and were conducted in compliance with the Spanish legislation
and in accordance with the Directives of the European Union. In
all experiments, male Wistar rats (weighing 275 to 310 g; Charles
River Laboratories) were used. Rats were kept in a climatecontrolled environment on a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle.
Food and water were available ad libitum during all experimental
process and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.

Infarct volume and neurological deficit evaluation
Infarct volume was measured using 2,3,5- triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC, Sigma-Aldrich) staining as described [19]. TTC
images were captured using a Cano Scan 4200F and infarct
volume was measured using Image J software by integration of
infarcted areas. Infarct volume data was expressed as a percentage
of the ipsilateral hemisphere and edema was evaluated taking into
account the following equation: edema = (infarct volume6contralateral volume)/ipsilateral volume.
Rats were assessed using a 9-point neurological deficit scale, as
previously described [18]. Four consecutive tests were conducted:
(I) spontaneous activity (moving and exploring = 0, moving
without exploring = 1, no moving or moving only when pulled
by the tail = 2); (II) left drifting during displacement (none = 0,
drifting only when elevated by the tail and pushed or pulled = 1,
spontaneous drifting = 2, circling without displacement, or spinning = 3), (III) parachute reflex (symmetrical = 0, asymmetrical = 1, contralateral forelimb retracted = 2), and (IV) resistance
to left forepaw stretching (stretching not allowed = 0, stretching
allowed after some attempts = 1, no resistance = 2). Neurological
score was assessed in a blinded manner at 90 minutes, 24 hours
and 48 hours after occlusion.

Embolic MCAO model
Infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery (MCA)
was induced by embolic occlusion (embolic MCAO) as previously
described [17]. Animals were anesthetized under spontaneous
respiration with 2% isoflurane (Abbot Laboratories, Kent, UK) in
oxygen during surgery and body temperature was maintained at
37uC. Arterial blood from a donor rat was withdrawn to form 2
clots (length: 1.5 cm; diameter: 0.3 mm) and they both were used
for embolization of the right MCA. Cranial trepanation was
performed the day before MCAO surgery to attach a laser–
Doppler probe (Moor Instruments, Devon, UK) and monitor
regional cerebral blood flow. Only animals that exhibited a
reduction .75% in regional cerebral blood flow during MCAO
were included in the study. Sham animals were submitted to both
trepanation and surgery procedures, but no blood clots were
injected into arteries. Three doses of analgesia (magnesic
metamizol) were administrated just after cranial trepanation,
MCAO surgery and 24 hours after it. All animals were euthanized
48 hours after the surgery. Naive animals were not submitted to
any procedure and were sacrificed the same day as ischemic and
sham ones.
A total of 59 rats were used for this study. Nine of them were
naive rats, 13 were sham and 37 were submitted to embolic
MCAO. Eleven of the ischemic animals were excluded after
applying the following criteria: inappropriate occlusion of the
MCA after embolization (n = 6); spontaneous reperfusion within
the next ten minutes after occlusion (n = 3) or sudden death during
the surgery process (n = 2). Blood samples were drawn through
transcardiac puncture 48 hours after embolic MCAO or after
sham surgery. Afterwards, rats were transcardially perfused with

Flow cytometry
Blood-leukocyte populations (monocytes, polymorphonuclears
(PMNs) and lymphocytes) were evaluated by flow cytometry
technique. With this aim, 500 ml of blood were incubated with
Ammonium-chlorid-kaliumhydrogencarbonat (ACK) buffer (room
temperature, 5 minutes) to lysate erythrocytes and later the pellet
was rinsed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution - Hepes (HBSSHepes, 500 g, 5 minutes at 4uC). The same process (lysiscleanliness-centrifugation) was repeated thrice. Cells were resuspended in 100 ml of FACS buffer, blocked with 0.25 mg purified

mouse anti-Rat CD32 (eBioscience, San Diego, Ca, USA) on ice
for 10 minutes and stained with 0.4 mg anti-Granulocyte MarkerPE (GrM-PE) (eBioscience) and 1 mg anti-Rat CD11b- FITC
(eBioscience) antibodies for 20 minutes on ice. A specific antibody
to detect cell viability, To-Pro-3 (eBioscience) was used to assess
samples preservation. A total of ten-thousand events per sample
were acquired using FacScalibur (Becton Dickinson, USA). To
discriminate leukocyte types, the following populations were
defined: PMNs were CD11b-FITC+ and GrM-PE+; monocytes
CD11b-FITC+ and GrM-PE- and lymphocytes CD11b-FITCand GrM-PE-. Data were analyzed with FCS Express version 3
(De Novo Software, USA) and expressed as percentage of total
leukocytes.

Changes in peripheral leukocytes count are correlated
with neurological outcome after stroke
As shown in figures 1A and 1B, striking differences were
detected through flow cytometry analysis among animal groups.
Leukocyte subpopulations could be properly separated and
lymphocytes clearly distinguished (Figure 1C).
Considering experimental groups, results obtained in flow
cytometry assays are represented in Figure 2. Cerebral ischemia
triggered an increase of PMNs in blood (71.7619.5%) as
compared to sham (51.7619.2%) p,0.05; and naive rats
(29.2614.7%); p,0.01; (n = 9-14 per group) (Figure 2A) and
conversely, decreased blood lymphocytes (22.90616.4%) were
found when compared either to sham (40.1619.7%) or naive
groups (58.8618.1%), although only when comparing ischemic vs.
naive the difference was significant, p,0.001 (Figure 2B). No
differences in monocytes percentage were found among groups
(naive: 2.07[0.79, 9.99] %; sham: 2.38[0.78, 5.48] %; ischemia:
2.32[0, 10.02] %), as shown in Figure 2C.
Interestingly, higher percentages of blood PMNs were positively
correlated with a worse neurological outcome 48 hours after
MCAO (p,0.05, r = 0.55); (Figure 2D), but no correlation was
observed at other time points. Neither lymphocyte nor monocyte
counts were correlated with neurological outcome.

Lung histology
Lungs were carefully removed and separated into right and left
lung under sterile conditions. Left lung was immersed in
formaldehyde 4% (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 48 hours,
embedded in paraffin wax and sectioned with a microtome in
4 mm thick sections. Hematoxilyn & Eosin (HE) stain was carried
out to perform lung tissue histological evaluation by an investigator blinded for study group.

Microbiological analysis
Lung imprints were performed pressing 4 times on blood-agar
plates’ surface with a piece of sterile right lung. Blood was
withdrawn by cardiac puncture in sterile conditions and lungs
were collected, minced and homogenized also under sterile
conditions. One-hundred mL of all specimens were serially diluted
in sterile PBS up to 200 mL of final solution, which was plated onto
blood agar plates (Biomérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). After 24
and 48 hours of incubation at 37uC, agar plates were analyzed for
growth colonies. Results of lung imprints were expressed as the
number of observed colonies. Results of both blood and lung
homogenate were expressed as a logarithmic function (log10).

Bacteriological analysis
Bacterial growth from lung homogenates plated on agar was
detected in both sham and MCAO groups, as shown in figure 3A.
In this sense, the number of CFU, was similar in sham rats
(3.962.5; CFU/mL; log10) and in ischemic rats (4.362.9; CFU/
mL; log10, p = 0.95) while naive lung homogenates did not show
bacterial growth (Figure 3B). Contrarily, no CFUs were detected
after plating blood samples of any of the groups. Regarding lung
imprints (Figure 3C), CFU growth also appeared in both sham
(43.40638.09; CFU/mL) and ischemic (50.67676.25; CFU/mL,
p = 0.55) groups. However, no CFU were seen in naive lung
homogenates, then indicating no previous pulmonary infection to
the surgical procedure (figure 3D).

CXCL-1 measurement
For the measurement of blood CXCL-1 cytokine, a simple
ELISA kit was purchased from R&D systems and used according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Lung histology evaluation
As expected, all naive rats (4/4) showed normal lung histology
consisting of definite alveoli with thin walls lined by two types of
cells: pneumocyte type I, the predominant cell type, and
pneumocyte type II, which are large and cuboidal and show short
microvilli on their cell surface. The interalveolar septa appeared
basically thin, although normal focal areas of thick septum could
be observed. In lung tissue from naive rats we also observed that
the BALT (bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue) which corresponds to the lung immune system, was generally located in
bronchi bifurcation. (Figure 4A–B).On the other hand, both sham
(n = 8) and ischemic (n = 8) groups showed altered lung histology
involving acute vascular congestion (10/16), oedema (6/16) and
intra-alveolar haemorrhage (4/16), in a diffused or patch
distribution and affecting one or more pulmonary lobes. We
observed lungs with lobular pneumonia and/or acute bronchopneumonia (4/16), characterized by PMN infiltration and
associated to cellular necrosis and parenchymal fibrin inside
alveoli or bronchioles. Some of these rats (3/16) showed also a
mononuclear cellularity increase. In addition, in all these rats,
although the number of BALT was strongly variable, they were
always associated to segmented bronchi and without germinal
centre, which is indicative of a reactive change (Figures 4C–F).

Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism_v5 software.
Statistical significance for intergroup differences was tested by
Student’s t-test and ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test
for parametric data. For non-parametric data, Mann Whitney and
Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s Multiple Comparison test
was performed. Correlations between parameters were tested by
Pearson (parametric data) or Spearman tests (non- parametric
data). For parametric data, bars represent mean6 SD and for
non- parametric data, box plots represent median (Interquartil
range). A p value,0.05 was considered statistically significant at a
95% confidence level.

Results
Infarct volume and neurological deficit
Infarct volumes of a subgroup of rats submitted to an eMCAO
were calculated and the mean was 40.62610.09% (n = 6), whereas
no infarct lesion was observed in sham animals in any case
(n = 13). Mean neurological score at 48 hours was 4.4362.9 for
ischemic animals and 0.2860.82 for sham animals.

81.57697.43 CFU/mL, p,0.01), while sham animals showed a
more moderate CFU growth (20.86635.06 CFU/mL) (Figure 5E).

Replication study using an intraluminal rat tMCAO model
Results obtained in this second set of experiments using a
transient model with a nylon filament were equivalent to those
derived from eMCAO model.The mean infarct volume of
ischemic rats submitted to a tMCAO (n = 7) was
40.54612.56%, and no lesion was detected in sham animals
(n = 7). The mean neurological score was 4.1461.07 for ischemic
rats and 0 for sham rats.
Regarding blood leukocyte counts, we observed that ischemic
animals showed an increase in blood PMNs (63.78622.28%) as
compared to sham (38.88626.65%) or naive (2266.5%) groups.
In this case, only the comparison between naive and ischemic
groups reached significance after Bonferroni correction (p,0.01)
(Figure 5A). Also in agreement with the data previously obtained,
a clear decrease in lymphocyte counts were found in ischemic
animals (33.06620.59%) when compared either to sham
(55.94625.11%) or naive animals (71.8767.55%), being significant only the comparison between naive and ischemic groups (p,
0.01) (Figure 5B). No differences in monocyte percentages were
detected among the three groups (naive: 4.45 [1.08, 7.6] %, sham:
4.23[1.3, 10.24] %, ischemia: 1.25[0.25, 60.7] %) (Figure 5C).
In relation to bacteriological analysis, CFU growth was
observed only after plating sham and ischemic lung homogenate
samples. We could detect significant differences when comparing
naive to sham animals (0 vs. 1.8862.16 CFU/mL log10, p,0.05)
and also naive to ischemic animals (0 vs. 2.561.81 CFU/mL;
log10, p,0.01) (Figure 5D). No CFUs were obtained after plating
blood samples of any of the groups. Considering lung imprints, we
only found differences between naive and ischemic rats (0 vs.
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

CXCL-1 measurement
Plasma levels of CXCL1 were evaluated 48 hours after ischemia
or sham surgery and also in naive rats (n = 7/each group). Sham
animals showed upregulated levels (15.79 [4.02, 45.98] pg/mL) as
compared with naive rats (3.9 [2.34, 15.53] pg/mL), although a
more pronounced release was seen in ischemic animals (30.75
[19.16, 123.4] pg/mL). After correction, only significance was
reached when comparing naive and ischemic animals (p,0.001)
(Figure 5F). Correlation between PMNs mobilization and CXCL1
plasma levels was also evaluated and we found a clear significance
(r = 0.66, p = 0.001) when animals of all groups were included
(n = 28) and a trend towards significance (r = 0.71, p = 0.08) when
only ischemic animals were evaluated (n = 7) (Data not shown).

Discussion
Experimental stroke induces systemic inflammatory responses
followed by global immunosuppression [7] that can make ischemic
animals more prone to infections. In this study, we aimed to
evaluate such stroke-induced infections using a MCAO rat model.
Blood analysis showed differences between sham and ischemic
animals in circulating PMNs. According to previous studies, it has
been well characterized that brain injury produces a secondary
inflammatory response, accompanied by an increase on systemic
neutrophils, the most representative PMN subtype [20,21].
Interestingly, we observed a positive correlation between circulat4

was found considering the infarct size stated by others [31]. Our
hypothesis is that all the disturbing factors entailed in these stroke
animal models (anaesthesia, surgical stress, inflammation) may
alter the association between infarct size and both the infection
and the immunodepression severity.
Pneumonia and bacteraemia are the most common infections in
stroke experimental studies [8], although bacteraemia appears less
frequently and later than pneumonia. In human stroke, urinary
tract infection has also a high incidence [3,32] but it is not as
common in animals as is in patients, probably because animals do
not need to be catheterized. Regarding our bacteria colonies
growth, surprisingly but in agreement with other studies [33],
none of the animals have shown signs of blood infection.
Contrarily, other studies detected bacteraemia after a transient
MCAO in mice [8,13,14]. Although it has been reported that
susceptibility to poststroke infections is species and strain
dependent [34], we reckon that another explanation for the
discrepancy in the results might be the short time our animals were
under study before euthanasia (48 hours versus 3, 5 or 15 days
reported by other studies). Furthermore, regarding our CFU/mL
lung counts at 48 hours (4.362.9 CFU/mL log10), we consider
they are in accordance with other publications [35] which
reported around 3.5 CFU/mL log10 at 24 hours and 6 CFU/
mL log10 at 72 hours after stroke in mice. However the variability

ing PMNs and neurological deficit at 48 hours. In agreement with
our results, other publications have reported an association
between early elevation of systemic neutrophil count in stroke
patients and ischemia severity [20]. On the other hand, similar to
other publications performed with mice [13] or humans [8,22], we
detected a lymphopenia on our ischemic rats. Though we did not
analyze lymphocyte subpopulations after stroke, we assume that it
would have been of great interest as it seems to be a controversial
issue. While most previous publications are in agreement showing
a significant reduction in blood T-cells after stroke [23–26], the
fact of whether or not B cells, NK cells, Tregs and monocytes are
altered after cerebral ischemia is still on debate [26–29].
Remarkably, our results showed that leukocyte changes were in
the same direction in both sham and ischemic groups. To explain
this, we support that both isoflurane and sham surgery might
disturb leukocyte responses, a hypothesis recently demonstrated in
a published study [30]. This work reported that surgical stress and
anaesthesia exert evident effects on both early and late cellular
responses in the bone marrow after submitting mice to an
experimental stroke. They also emphasized that volatile anaesthetics might affect leukocyte responses by altering neutrophil
adherence to blood vessels and inducing lymphocyte apoptosis.
Despite a significant decrease in lymphocyte percentage could be
observed in ischemic compared to naive animals, no correlation

experimental model is around 40%, as similarly shown in other
studies [17] and can be attributed to the severe brain injury and to
some secondary complications such as the loss of weight.
Investigation of immunity and infection response at further time
points (5–7 days after MCAO) would be, undoubtedly interesting.
Nonetheless, such mortality rate during the first 48 hours limits the
potential of studying longer time points that may allow us to assess
more evident differences between sham and ischemic animals and
avoid the effects of the surgery. Besides, although the embolic
model is believed to be the most resembling stroke model to
human pathology, it leads to a considerable variability among
animals in terms of infarct volume and outcome which makes
more difficult to reach to conclusions.
On the other hand, the fact of obtaining similar results after
submitting the rats to a tMCAO model introducing a nylon
filament and submitting them to an embolic MCAO model makes
us consider the cranial trepanation and the cervicotomy as
responsibles for the immunodepression state detected also in sham
animals. In this direction, some authors concluded that even being
sterile, brain surgeries may contribute to a general immunodepression [36] induced by stress and injury [37]. Considering this
statement, our sham rats (submited to a cranial trepanation) could
also be considered a model of brain surgery. Additionally,
cervicotomy performed in both ischemic and sham animals,

in number and type of colonies found in different spontaneous
infection studies has been demonstrated to be totally related with
the environment where the animals are placed [33,34].
Lung evaluation showed normal histology in naive rats whereas
both sham and ischemic animals presented non-specific lesions
such as distension of alveolar units, thickened alveolar septa,
cellular consolidated areas, presence of inflammatory infiltrates,
oedema and haemorrhage. The severity of these lesions was
extraordinarily variable among animals of the same group in both
sham and ischemic animals. Again, surgery stress, anaesthesia and
inflammatory response due to the cranial trepanation could also
explain these non-specific lung lesions found in both sham and
ischemic animals.
Compiling our results, we have found many unexpected
changes in sham animals in the present study. The animal (species
and strain) or the model we have performed to induce ischemia
could have had a big influence in our final results. To our
knowledge, this is the first study inducing ischemia in rats by
embolic MCAO and assessing bacterial analysis and lung histology
thus we can speculate that the strong severity of the model (in part
due to the cranial trepanation and the prolonged anaesthesia)
could contribute to an important systemic inflammatory response.
Despite our efforts in reducing the pain and discomfort of the rats
subjected to an embolic stroke, the mortality associated to this

which can envolve iatrogenic manipulation of Vagus nerve, may
also contribute to immune system alterations.
In agreement with Campbell et al. [38] who reported that after
an acute injury in rodent brain, central nervous system triggers
CXC chemokine expression (which is associated with leukocyte
mobilisation), CXCL1 blood levels appeared elevated in both
sham and ischemic animals in our study (although only the
comparison between naive and ischemic animals reached significance). Moreover, good correlation was found between PMNs
mobilization and CXCL1 blood levels. With these findings we can
affirm; firstly, that both surgical stress and volatile anaesthesia
exerted effects on chemokine response, as stated by Denes et al.
[30]. Secondly, that cerebral ischemia per se triggers an additional
chemokine effect. Thirdly, that in this animal model, as found
previously in others [30,36] chemokines such as CXCL1 are
contributing to PMNs mobilization.
Consequently, an important result to highlight from our study is
that including a sham animal group in stroke-induce infection
studies is extremely important to identify surgery-related responses
and avoid misinterpretation of the data from ischemic animals.
Additionally, it might be of great importance to check the sanitary
status of the animals (presence of opportunistic and not only
pathogenic microorganisms) previously to the surgery if the aim of
the study is to evaluate spontaneous infections.
In conclusion, our study could not discriminate ischemic from
sham animals in terms of infection evaluation after embolic
MCAO. Therefore, we cannot affirm that changes observed in

ischemic animals are the consequence of the ischemic insult. The
initial hypothesis of our study was that stroke-induced immunodepression in the rat would make ischemic animals more prone to
respiratory infections. Considering very recent publications which
report some neuroprotectants to ameliorate stroke-induced
peripheral immunodepression [35], we thought that having a rat
model of stroke-induced immunodepression would be of great
importance to test potential drugs for immunomodulatory
therapeutic strategies. But unexpectedly, we found that in almost
all evaluated parameters, sham animals were more similar to
ischemic than to naive animals. Thus, our caution is that both
embolic and intraluminal nylon suture MCAO in rats are not
suitable models to study infections after stroke. All in all, the
differences on immunological parameters depending on the
species and strain and the influence of anaesthetics and surgical
stress have to be taken into account in further experimental and
translational studies for immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies,
at least in rat stroke models which entail cervicotomy and cranial
trepanation.
