Abstract
Cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) are crucial for
brain vascular repair and maintenance, but their physiological
function may be impaired during ischemic stroke and diabetes.
Methylglyoxal (MGO), a reactive dicarbonyl produced during
glucose metabolism, could exacerbate ischemia-induced EC
injury and dysfunction. We investigated the protective effect of
autophagy on cultured human brain microvascular endothelial
cells (HBMEC) that underwent MGO treatment. A further study
was conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms of the
protective effect. Autophagic activity was assessed by evaluating protein levels, using western blot. 3-methyladenine
(3-MA), baﬁlomycin A1, ammonium chloride (AC), Beclin 1
siRNA, and chloroquine (CQ) were used to cause autophagy
inhibition. Alarmar blue assay and lactate dehydrogenase
release assay were used to evaluate cell viability. Streptozotocin was administered to induce type I diabetes in rats and
post-permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was

performed to elicit cerebral ischemia. Blood–brain barrier
permeability was also assessed. Our study found that MGO
reduced HBMEC cell viability in a concentration- and timedependent manner, and triggered the responsive autophagy
activation. Autophagy inhibitors baﬁlomycin A1, AC, 3-MA, and
BECN1 siRNA exacerbated MGO-induced HBMEC injury. FAK
phosphorylation inhibitor PF573228 inhibited MGO-triggered
autophagy and enhanced lactate dehydrogenase release.
Meanwhile, similar autophagy activation in brain vascular ECs
was observed during permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced cerebral ischemia in diabetic rats, while chloroquine-induced autophagy inhibition enhanced blood–brain
barrier permeability. Taken together, our study indicates that
autophagy triggered by MGO defends HBMEC against injuries.

Background

patients with diabetes may be associated with elevation of
MGO levels in the brain, and accumulating evidences show
that MGO plays a critical role in the progression of diabetic
vascular complications (Goh and Cooper 2008). Moreover,

Patients with diabetes have a higher risk of cerebrovascular
disease and stroke (Li et al. 2010), and more than 70% of
patients with Type 2 diabetes die of cardiovascular causes
(Laakso 2001). Ischemic stroke, a major type of stroke, is
associated with decreased blood ﬂow to the brain and the
cascading events may cause further cerebrovascular injuries.
High-serum levels of methylglyoxal (MGO) were observed
in patients with either Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes (Mukohda
et al. 2012). MGO is considered as an important glycating
agent causing glycation damage to the mitochondrial
proteome (Ramasamy et al. 2012) and cytotoxicity mediated
by the modiﬁcation of DNA and activation of apoptosis
(Murata-Kamiya and Kamiya 2001). Recent reports have
implicated that the pathogenesis in cerebrovascular injury in

in our previous study, we used MGO to cause hyperglycemia-induced cell injury (Li et al. 2013b). However,
little is known about whether MGO accelerates ischemic
vascular damage (such as the cerebrovascular complications
in ischemic stroke) and what innate mechanism may underlie
the protective response to this ischemia-induced endothelial
apoptosis.
Autophagy is a process through which cells recycle
cytoplasm and remove defective organelles. It also affects
the diabetic vascular system by reducing elevated ﬁssile
mitochondria in the endothelium (Shenouda et al. 2011;
LaRocca et al. 2012). Though autophagy was reported to
have controversial effects (both detrimental and beneﬁcial) in
several diseases, such as cancer, liver disease, muscular
disorder, neurodegeneration, and pathogen infection (Shintani and Klionsky 2004), it has been widely accepted that
autophagy is activated as a survival response that removes
toxic subjects and damaged organelles for injuries falling
under a certain threshold. When this threshold is surpassed,
autophagy leads to cell death (Jin 2006; Mazure and
Pouyssegur 2010). For stroke concurrent with diabetes,
however, the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of
ischemic cerebrovascular injury is still not clear.
In this study, we initially investigated the function and
mechanism of autophagy in MGO-induced injury in cultured
human brain microvascular endothelial cell line (HBMEC).
After establishing the role of autophagy in endothelial cell
ischemic injury, we explored the function and mechanism of
autophagy in cerebrovascular ischemic injury in diabetic rats
following pMCAO.

Methods
Cell line and reagents
A human brain microvascular endothelial cell line (HBMEC) has
been previously characterized (Lok et al. 2009). RPMI 1640, fetal
bovine serum, Nu-Serum, minimal essential medium, non-essential
amino acids, and sodium pyruvate were purchased from Gibco
(Grand Island, NY, USA). MGO (40% w/v) was purchased from
Yuanye Biotech (Shanghai, China), streptozotocin and chloroquine
(CQ) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). The
Caspase-3 activity assay kit was purchased from Biovision (Milpitas,
CA, USA). All of the secondary antibodies were purchased from
Multi Sciences (Hangzhou, China). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
assay kit was purchased from Nanjing Institute of Jianchen
Biological Engineering (Nanjing, China). Mouse anti-b-actin monoclonal antibody was purchased from Abmart.
Cell culture and viability assay
HBMEC cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal
bovine serum and 5% CO2 in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37°C.
HBMEC cells were treated with 1 mmol/l aminoguanidine of
different concentrations for different durations. For pretreatment,
baﬁlomycin A1 (BAF; 10 nmol/l; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO,
USA), ammonium chloride (AC; 20 mmol/l; Sigma-Aldrich),

3-methyladenine (3-MA; 10 nmol/l; Sigma-Aldrich), or PF573228
(10 lmol/l, Sigma-Aldrich) was added into the media 20 min before
MGO treatment. Experimental agents were dissolved in either
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (BAF, PF573228) or water, and were
added to the media in a volume never exceeding 0.5% (DMSO
solution) or 5% (water solution). The same DMSO or water solvent
was present in the control culture.
Cell viability was determined by the Alamar Blue assay. 1.1 mL
of Alamar Blue reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added
to 11 mL of cell-type speciﬁc growth media for each plate to be
assayed. 110 lL of growth media containing Alamar Blue reagent
was added to each well, and the plates were incubated in 5% CO2 at
37°C for 2 h. Fluorescence of the samples was measured at the
excitation and emission maxima at 530 and 590 nm, respectively.
Raw ﬂuorescent counts were converted to viability percentage. The
release of intracellular enzyme LDH was used as a marker of cell
membrane damage to evaluate cell viability/cytotoxicity according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Jiancheng Biotec, Nanjing,
China).
RNA interference
The transfection of HBMEC with siRNA against human BECN1
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) or negative control siRNA (Qiagen)
was accomplished using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After
transfection, cells were maintained for 24 h for later use.
Animal experiments
All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with the
protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Zhejiang University. Sixty male Sprague–Dawley rats
weighting 280–320 g (Shanghai Xbubi-bikai Laboratory Animal Co.
Ltd) were housed in cages with 12-h light/dark cycle at controlled
temperature and humidity with free access to food and water.
The animals were randomly divided into two groups: (i) Stroke
pMCAO ( n = 28 per group) and (ii) Diabetic stroke (n = 28 per
group). In the second experiment, the diabetic rats were divided into
three groups (n = 6 per group): (i) Sham (sham MCAO), (ii) Control
(MCAO), and (iii) CQ treatment following MCAO, with CQ [SigmaAldrich; 20 mg/kg in 200 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)]
administered 30 min after the onset of ischemia. The sham or control
group was injected with saline in the same volume as CQ. Twentyfour hours after MCAO, the animals were killed, and brain samples
from each group were used for Evan’s blue experiment, western blot,
and Immunoﬂuorescence staining.
Model of Type I diabetes in rats
Sprague–Dawley rats were fasted overnight (with free access to
water) and then randomly divided into normal and diabetic groups,
which received an intraperitoneal injection of vehicle (0.1 mol/l
citrate buffer, pH 4.5) (Tesch and Allen 2007) alone and Streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma; at a dosage of 60 mg/kg, dissolved in
0.1 mol/l citrate buffer), respectively (Fan et al. 2012). Seven days
after STZ administration and overnight fast, blood glucose level was
measured from the tail vein blood with a blood glucose monitor
(Johnson & Johnson Medical, Milpitas, CA, USA). Rats with blood
glucose concentrations higher than 280 mg/dL were categorized as
diabetic.

Autophagy protects HBMECs on MGO-induced injuries

Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats
pMCAO was performed on the rats in both the non-diabetic and
diabetic stroke groups, 28 days after the administration of STZ or
vehicle. Anesthesia was induced by pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.p.)
and atropine (0.1 mg/kg). The animal’s body temperature was
maintained using a heating lamp (with a rectal temperature between
36.5 and 37.5°C). As previously described (Sun et al. 2003), after
identifying the right common carotid artery, external carotid artery,
and internal carotid artery, a 4-0 (determined by the animal body
weight) monoﬁlament nylon suture (Beijing Sunbio, Beijing, China)
with a rounded tip was inserted into the internal carotid artery
through the external carotid artery and then gently advanced to
block the origin of the middle cerebral artery (Xing et al. 2008).
Animals were killed 0.5 or 24 h after pMCAO.
Evans Blue for BBB permeability evaluation
Rats were administered with 2% Evans blue (EB, Sigma, dissolved in
PBS) at a dosage of 5 mL/kg through the tail vein injection, and then
anesthetized 60 min later. After perfusion with PBS, the whole brain
was removed and split into two hemispheres. Each part was
homogenized in 2 mL of 50% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged
at 11200 g for 20 min. The supernatant was diluted four folds with
ethanol (50% trichloroacetic acid/ethanol, 1 : 3) and placed at 4°C
overnight. Samples were centrifuged at 15 000 g for 30 min at 4°C
the next day, and 1 mL of supernatant was saved to quantify Evans
blue concentration by ﬂuorescence spectrophotometry (SpectraMax
M5; Molecular Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) at an excitation
wavelength of 620 nm and an emission wavelength of 680 nm, as
previously described (Park et al. 2004).
Double fluorescence labeling
Rats were anesthetized and perfused with PBS and 4%
paraformaldehyde as described previously (Yin et al. 2003). Brains
were removed and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h and
incubated in 30% sucrose in PBS for at least 48 h at 4°C. Coronal
brain sections were cut at 7 lm, using a freezing microtome (Leica
CM3050 S; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were incubated in a
mixture consisting of 3% hydrogen peroxide, 0.3% Triton-X 100
PBS, and 10% serum for 1 h followed by the overnight primary
antibody incubation at 4°C. The following antibodies were used:
rabbit anti-Beclin 1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) 1 : 1000 and
mouse anti-CD31 (Abcam) 1 : 1000, respectively. After rinsing
with PBS, the sections were then incubated with an FITC anti-rabbit
(1 : 200) and Cy3 anti-mouse (1 : 200) mixture for 2 h at 25 °C.
After mounting with anti-fade mounting medium (Beyotime,
Haimen, China), sections were examined under a Leica DM5500B
ﬂuorescence microscope (Leica Co.).
Western blot analysis
Protein concentrations were assessed by reducing agent-compatible
bicinchoninic acid assays kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology,
Beijing, China). Sixty micrograms of protein samples, prepared from
both cells and rat tissues, were loaded onto 8% or 15% polyacrylamide
gels (according to protein molecular weight) and electro-transferred to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes. The primary antibodies
included: rabbit polyclonal LC3 (1 : 1000; Cell Signaling, Beverly,
MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal Beclin 1 antibody (1 : 500; Santa Cruz,
CA, USA), rabbit polyclonal antibodies against BECN1/Beclin

433

(1 : 1000, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit polyclonal p62/
SQSTM1 (1 : 1000; Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal total FAK
(1 : 1000; Cell Signaling), rabbit polyclonal phosphor-Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) (1 : 1000; Cell Signaling), and rabbit monoclonal
b-actin (1 : 1000; Cell Signaling). The secondary antibodies were
horseradish peroxidase conjugated sheep anti-rabbit antibodies
(1 : 1000; Beyotime). Immunoblotting was detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence and imaged on Molecular Imagerâ ChemiDocTM XPS+ Image System (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
Western blot band densities were quantiﬁed, using the BIO-RAD
Laboratories Quantity One software (Mississauga, ON, Canada).
Statistical analysis
The in vitro data were presented as mean  SD and the in vivo data
were presented as mean  SEM. Statistical analysis was performed
using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test for multiple
comparison tests using SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) or two-way ANOVA using PRISM 5.0 (GraphPad Software
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), appropriately. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
MGO reduced HBMEC cell viability and induced autophagy
To examine the cytotoxic effect of MGO on HBMEC, we
treated HBMEC with MGO at concentrations ranging from
0.3 to 10 mmol/l for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1a, MGO
decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, 1 mmol/l MGO time-dependently reduced cell
viability (Fig. 1b). Next, we investigated whether MGO can
trigger autophagy by examining the LC3-II/LC3-I expression
ratio, using western blot analysis. As shown in Fig 1c–d, the
LC3-II/LC3-I ratio had a 4.6-fold increase at 1 h in cells
treated with MGO (1 mmol/l) compared with control. The
ratio then dropped in a time-dependent manner, which was
only 0.75-fold of control at 24 h (Fig. 1c and d). Meanwhile,
we analyzed the protein levels of p62/sequestosome1
(SQSTM1) degraded in the autophagosome, thus testing
another marker of autophagy ﬂux. In the ﬁrst hour, MGO
treatment showed trends of decreased SQSTM1 compared
with control, which then increased by 3.2 folds at 24 h
(Fig. 1e and f). While the pretreatment with autophagy
inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA; 1 mmol/l), which can
block early stage autophagy through the inhibition of class III
PI3K, increased SQSTM1 accumulation (Fig. 1e and f).
Together, these data indicated that MGO decreased HBMEC
cell viability, accompanied by the activation of autophagy.
Autophagy protected HBMEC from MGO-induced
cytotoxicity
Firstly, we found that the increase of LC3II levels was also
observed in the presence of proteolysis inhibitors BAF and
ammonium chloride (AC) (Fig. 2a), thus conﬁrming that
MGO-mediated LC3II accumulation was due to the
increased LC3 conversion, rather than the inhibition of its

proteolytic degradation (Klionsky et al. 2008). As to whether
cell death was exacerbated by autophagy inhibition, we
found that BAF (20 nmol/l) and 3-MA (1 mmol/l) were able
to reduce cell viability and increase LDH release in MGOinduced cell injury, as shown in Fig. 2b and c.
Considering that these inhibitors could have autophagy
inhibition-independent effects, and that 3-MA can even
induce autophagy through its differential temporal effects on
class I and class III PI3K (Wu et al. 2010), we assessed the
role of autophagy in MGO-exposed HBMEC cells, using
RNA interference-mediated knockdown of BECN1, which is
an essential platform for autophagy interactome machinery
(Cao and Klionsky 2007). LDH release assay demonstrated
that the cells transfected with BECN1 small-interfering (si)
RNA were more sensitive to MGO treatment than their
control RNA-transfected counterparts (Fig. 2d), thus conﬁrming that the induction of autophagy protected HBMEC
from the cytotoxic effects of MGO. Furthermore, BAF also
increased MGO-induced caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2e).
Together, these data demonstrated that autophagy plays a
protective role in MGO-induced HBMEC cytotoxicity.
MGO-triggered autophagy is FAK-dependent in HBMEC
We then explored the mechanisms underlying MGO-mediated autophagy induction in HBMEC. It was reported that
the autophagic activity was enhanced in cancer cells when
the FAK pathway is severely perturbed (English et al. 2011;
Sandilands et al. 2012). Hence, we investigated if FAK
activity affected autophagy in MGO-induced HBMEC
injuries. There was a transient elevation of FAK phosphorylation in the cultured HBMEC at 1 h after MGO
administration, followed by a time-dependent decrease that
lasted until the end, 24 h after MGO treatment (Fig. 3a and
b). Furthermore, we found that PF573228, a FAK phosphorylation inhibitor also decreased the LC3II/LC3I ratio in
the cultured HBMEC compared with control (Fig. 3c and
d). In addition, pretreatment with PF573228 (100 lmol/l)
even exacerbated cell death in comparison with MGO
treatment alone in the cultured HBMEC (Fig. 3e), while
PF573228 (100 lmol/l) alone had no effect on cell viability
(Fig. 3e).
Autophagy protects rat cerebral vascular ECs against
ischemic injury under diabetes condition
The above ﬁndings indicated that FAK-phosphorylationdependent activation of autophagy likely played a protective
role in MGO-induced injury in HBMEC. We further
investigated if the protective effect of autophagy also
extended to cerebral vascular EC ischemic injury under
diabetic condition. To evaluate the cerebrovascular endothelial function after ischemic stroke in diabetic rats, the Evans
blue assay was performed 24 h after onset of pMCAO. The
ratio of Evans blue between ipsilateral brain and contralateral brain was signiﬁcantly higher in the diabetic rats

compared with non-diabetic rats (Fig. 4a). By evaluating
the autophagy activity in ischemic cerebrovascular endothelial injury in vivo, using Beclin-1 (another autophagy
marker) (Jung et al. 2008) and CD31 (endothelial marker)
double staining, we found that there was more co-localization of Beclin-1 and CD31 at 0.5 h post pMCAO in
diabetic rats (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, in the rat cerebral
cortex, the phosphorylation of FAK was signiﬁcantly
decreased 24 h after pMCAO in diabetic rats compared
with non-diabetic rats (Fig. 4c and d), which suggested that
the activation of FAK was inhibited in diabetic rats
subjected to pMCAO.
Since CQ can arrest the later stage of autophagy, the
fusion and degradation of autolysosome (Kimura et al.
2013), we investigated if autophagy blockade at late stage
might enhance Evans blue leakage in diabetic rats with
cerebral ischemia. As shown in Fig. 4f, the right lateral
ventricle injection of CQ signiﬁcantly increased Evans
blue leakage at 24 h after the onset of pMCAO (Fig. 4f),
which conﬁrmed the protective role of autophagy in
cerebral vascular ECs of diabetic rats with cerebral
ischemia.

Discussion
Cerebrovascular integrity was critically affected in the
pathogenesis of stroke (Madden 2012), which is a common
disease in diabetic patients. Based on the previous ﬁndings
on controversial roles of autophagy in various diseases, we
investigated the effect of autophagy on ischemia-induced
cerebrovascular injury in the diabetic setting, as a way to
understand the pathogenesis of cerebrovascular complications in diabetic and stroke patients. Augmentation of MGO
formation was noticeable during diabetes, which possessed
200 to ~ 50 000-fold higher glycosylation activity than
glucose and could severely disrupt cell stability (Zhang et al.
2012). Meanwhile, reports showed that hyperglycemia with
elevated MGO induce vascular and endothelial dysfunction,
causing ischemic damage in diabetic retinopathy (Stitt et al.
1997; Dai et al. 2013). Furthermore, our previous report
indicated MGO can produce microvascular endothelial injury
(Li et al. 2013b), which lead to the signiﬁcance of vascular
detrimental effect of MGO in diabetics. In the present study,
we constructed the in vitro diabetic model using MGOtreated HBMEC to study the endothelial injury. We found
that MGO induced a concentration- and time-dependent
cytotoxicity in cultured HBMEC, which is consistent with
our previous ﬁnding. For these reasons, we assessed the
autophagy activity during the course of MGO treatment and
investigated its effect on MGO-induced cytotoxicity in these
HBMECs.
Autophagy was involved in both mitochondrial degradation and surveillance (Jin 2006; Scherz-Shouval and Elazar

products (AGEs)-bovine serum albumin (BSA) increases the
level of autophagy, which is protective against endothelial
cell injury (Xie et al. 2011). Mindful of the difﬁculties in
monitoring autophagy (Klionsky et al. 2012), we examined
several autophagic markers in MGO-treated HBMEC. The

ﬁndings on LC3 conversion and the autophagic cargo

found that soon after MGO was administered, autophagy
reached its peak level, which then started to diminish. This is

consistent with our current ﬁnding about the ability of MGO
to induce cell injury.
In addition, we found that the increase in LC3 levels was
also observed in the presence of proteolysis inhibitors BAF
and NH4Cl, which conﬁrmed that MGO-mediated LC3II

accumulation was due to the increased LC3 conversion, rather
than inhibition of its proteolytic degradation. Apoptosis may
begin with autophagy and autophagy can often end with
apoptosis (Booth et al. 2014). For instance, autophagosome
formation generates a platform of activation of caspase 3 (Fan
and Zong 2013). Moreover, accumulation of autophagosomes
may be toxic and trigger apoptosis, which is associated with
increased ROS (reactive oxygen species) and subsequent
mitochondrial permeabilization (Ma et al. 2012). Furthermore, BAF or AC also decreased cell viability and increased
the level of LDH released in MGO-treated HBMEC. Knockdown of pro-autophagic protein BECN1/Beclin 1 slightly
exacerbated MGO-induced cell death. Thus, it is reasonable to
regard autophagy as a protective response in the endothelial
cells, which is triggered by the onset of MGO insult. The
decrease of autophagy activity over time also suggests that
when the insult was persistent, autophagy fails to keep up and
protect endothelial cells against further injury.
Earlier reports showed that FAK phosphorylation
increased with ischemic injury in rats after 24 h MCAO,
and the selective integrin ab3 inhibitor cRGDfV decreased
FAK phosphorylation and attenuated the ischemic injury in
the MCAO model by preserving the blood–brain barrier
(BBB) (Shimamura et al. 2006). Studies also indicate that
cancer cell survival increased when the Src/FAK pathway
was inhibited, which may be attributable to the enhanced
expression of autophagy components, while the FAK
activity was inhibited by the induction of autophagy
(Bijnsdorp and Peters 2011; English et al. 2011; Sandilands
et al. 2012). Considering the important role of FAK
signaling in cell death, we investigated if it is also involved
in inducing autophagy activation during the endothelial
ischemic injury in the diabetic setting. In the cultured
HBMEC, FAK phosphorylation increased and peaked 1 h
after MGO administration. Furthermore, FAK phosphorylation inhibitor PF573228 blocked the MGO-triggered
autophagy activity, and exacerbated MGO-induced cell
death in cultured HBMECs. Hence, it is suggested that the
autophagy activation and its subsequent protective effect
may be associated with the activation of the FAK pathway.
Aside from the in vitro study, we investigated autophagy
activity and its effect on pMCAO-induced ischemic cerebrovascular injury in diabetic rats. The protective role of
autophagy and its correlation with FAK signaling in MGOenhanced ischemic endothelial injury in vitro was also found
in pMCAO-induced cerebrovascular injury in diabetic rats.
Previous studies showed that diabetes increased cerebral
infarct volume and exacerbated neurobehavioral dysfunction
in ischemic animals (Fan et al. 2012; Ning et al. 2012). In our
study, we found the BBB permeability was increased in
diabetic rats 24 h after pMCAO. Diabetes is a chronic
condition associated with cerebral small-vessel disease,
stroke, and dementia (Alzheimer and vascular) (Beard et al.
2011). The list of diabetes-mediated vasculopathies includes

439

endothelial damage, vessel wall malformation, and increased
permeability of the BBB in rodents and humans (Najjar et al.
2013). Mounting evidence suggests that an increase in BBB
permeability is an important factor in initiating cerebral smallvessel disease and diabetic stroke (Li et al. 2013a). For the
ischemic insult-triggered autophagy activation, we found that
autophagy was activated after the onset of pMCAO in diabetic
rats, which was consistent with our in vitro data. Furthermore,
CQ inhibits autophagosome–lysosome fusion and degradation, while pretreatment with CQ promoted the EB leakage
after pMCAO-induced ischemic injury in diabetic rats.
Thus, our study demonstrated that the activation
of autophagy served as an endogenic protective response to
the early stage of endothelial injury in vitro (induced by
MGO) as well as diabetic and ischemic cerebrovascular
injury in vivo (induced by pMCAO in diabetic rats). In
addition, this effect may be associated with FAK signaling as
it seems to be FAK-phosphorylation dependent.
