Dynamics of major histocompatibility complex
class II-positive cells in the postischemic brain influence of levodopa treatment
Enida Kuric* and Karsten Ruscher*

Abstract
Background: Cerebral ischemia activates both the innate and the adaptive immune response, the latter being
activated within days after the stroke onset and triggered by the recognition of foreign antigens.
Methods: In this study we have investigated the phenotype of antigen presenting cells and the levels of associated
major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules in the postischemic brain after transient occlusion of
the middle cerebral artery (tMCAO) followed by levodopa/benserazide treatment. Male Sprague Dawley rats were
subjected to tMCAO for 105 minutes and received levodopa (20 mg/kg)/benserazide (15 mg/kg) for 5 days starting
on day 2 after tMCAO. Thereafter, immune cells were isolated from the ischemic and contralateral hemisphere and
analyzed by flow cytometry. Complementarily, the spatiotemporal profile of MHC II-positive (MHC II+) cells was studied
in the ischemic brain during the first 30 days after tMCAO; protein levels of MHC II and the levels of inflammation
associated cytokines were determined in the ischemic hemisphere.
Results: We found that microglia/macrophages represent the main MHC II expressing cell in the postischemic
brain one week after tMCAO. No differences in absolute cell numbers were found between levodopa/benserazide
and vehicle-treated animals. In contrast, MHC II protein levels were significant downregulated in the ischemic infarct
core by levodopa/benserazide treatment. This reduction was accompanied by reduced levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-4
in the ischemic hemisphere. In the contralateral hemisphere, we exclusively detected MHC II+ cells in the corpus
callosum. Interestingly, the number of cells was increased by treatment with levodopa/benserazide independent
from the infarct size 14 days after tMCAO.
Conclusions: Results suggest that dopamine signaling is involved in the adaptive immune response after stroke
and involves microglia/macrophages.

Background
A long-lasting inflammatory response is observed in
the postischemic brain [1] involving the stepwise activation of the innate and the adaptive immune systems
[2]. Inflammation initially is triggered by the release of
pro-inflammatory molecules such as danger associated
molecules (DAMPs), and propagated by pro-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines [3]. Subsequently, accumulation of activated microglial cells in the ischemic territory

contribute to encapsulate infarcted tissue and to clear
cellular debris [4-6]. Upon microglial activation, immune
related molecules such as major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) are upregulated and involved in antigen
presentation and thus in the interaction with peripheral
immune cells. MHC II-positive (MHC II+) cells are present
in the ipsilesional hemisphere during the first month following transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery [5].
In addition to the ischemic lesion, disruption of neuronal
tracts between lesioned and remote brain areas ipsi- and
contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere have a significant
impact on recovery [7]. These also include interhemispheric connections through the corpus callosum (CC)

which contains a large number of myelinated axonal fibers
originating from specific cortical areas mainly located
in intermediate cortical layers [8]. Disruption of neuronal
circuits may go along with delayed degeneration of axonal
fibers and possibly with an immune cell response [9].
This idea is supported by studies showing the presence
of MHC II+ cells in white matter tracts in association
with degenerating myelinated axons following injury
[5,10]. Moreover, it has been shown that immunoreactivity to myelin basic protein is increased in lymphoid
organs of stroke patients which was correlated with
worse outcome [11].
Previous studies indicate that dopamine exerts immunomodulatory actions through activation of respective
receptors expressed in immune cells [12,13]. In addition,
beneficial effects on recovery of lost motor function have
been demonstrated in stroke patients treated with
levodopa in combination with forced physical training
[14,15]. We have demonstrated that delayed treatment
with levodopa of rats subjected to transient occlusion
of the middle cerebral artery (tMCAO) improves recovery
of lost function [16]. Moreover, our studies also suggest
that glial and immune cells are involved in levodopamediated recovery- enhancing effects [17,18].
The dynamics of immune cell accumulation have been
characterized by several independent studies showing a
coordinated accumulation of immune cell populations during the first weeks after experimental stroke [19-21]. However, pharmacological modulation by levodopa/benserazide
on immune cell infiltration into the postischemic brain
after stroke has not been investigated. The present study,
therefore, was conducted to investigate if levodopa/benserazide treatment affects poststroke inflammation.

Materials and methods
Ethics statement

All animal experiments were carried out with the approval
of the Malmö-Lund Ethical Committee and followed the
ARRIVE guidelines.
Transient rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)

tMCAO was induced for 105 minutes as described previously [22]. Male Sprague Dawley rats (325 to 350 g,
Harlan Scandinavia, Denmark) were housed under diurnal light conditions and were fasted for 12 hours before
surgery. Physiological parameters - arterial blood pressure
and gases after tail artery cannulation and insertion of a
catheter (SIMS Portex, Hythe, UK) for rectal body
temperature - were measured and controlled within
their physiological range during surgery. To monitor
regional blood flow, an optical fiber probe (Probe 318-I;
Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden) was mounted on the skull
above the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and connected
to a laser Doppler flow meter (Periflux System 5000;

Page 2 of 12

Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden). Rats only were included
in the study if regional blood flow decreased by at least
70% immediately after the filament was placed; the
regional blood flow reduction was sustained during the
entire occlusion time (105 minutes); and if the regional
blood flow was recovered within 5 minutes after the
filament was removed. The same protocol was applied
to sham operated rats except that no filament was
advanced to occlude the MCA. Experiments were carried
out in accordance to the ARRIVE guidelines. For the
present investigation, in total 68 Sprague Dawley rats have
been operated on. Eighteen rats died during the first
48 hours after tMCAO before randomization; thereafter,
none of the animals died until the endpoint of the study.
tMCAO for 120 minutes was performed in male Wistar
rats (325 to 350 g, HsdBrlHan, Harlan Scandinavia,
Denmark, 325 to 350 g, Taconic, Sweden) for immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses [22].
Study design and treatment protocol

Sprague Dawley rats were randomized and the studies
were performed in a blinded fashion to the investigator
who performed the surgeries and behavior assessments.
Loss of sensorimotor function was assessed by the rotating pole test and the Garcia test 48 hours after tMCAO
[22]. Only animals with a significant loss of function
were assigned into the following treatment groups: sham
vehicle n = 8, sham levodopa/benserazide n = 7, tMCAO
vehicle n = 10 and tMCAO levodopa/benserazide n = 12.
Treatment was initiated on day 2 after tMCAO and for an
additional 4 days rats received daily 20 mg/kg levodopa
combined with 15 mg/kg benserazide (Sigma-Aldrich,
Deisenhofen, Germany) or saline (vehicle) by intraperitoneal injection. On day 7 after stroke onset, rats were
sacrificed and brains have been processed for fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. The study design was
chosen so that treatment would not interfere with acute
cell death mechanisms which essentially have finished
at 48 hours after stroke onset. The rationale to test a
dosage of 20 mg/kg of levodopa is based on our previous
study showing improved recovery after tMCAO [16].
Wistar rats were randomized and treated as described
previously [16], sacrificed 14 days after the surgery. Tissue
from the same set of those animals was used in the
present study. In particular, for western blots, immunohistochemistry, immunoassay and quantification of the
number of MHC II+ cells, the following number of animals
have been included: sham vehicle n = 4, sham LD n = 4,
tMCAO vehicle n = 8, tMCAO LD n = 8. To study the spatiotemporal profile of MHC II+ expressing cells in the postischemic brain, coronal sections from Wistar rats subjected
to tMCAO for 120 minutes were used as described previously [22]. At least sections from 3 animals per time point
(2 days, 4 days, 7 days, 14 days and 30 days) were analyzed.

Isolation of immune cells from brain tissue

Immune cells were prepared as described previously
[23]. In brief, rats have been anesthetized with isoflurane
and blood cells were removed from cerebral vessels by
perfusion with saline for four minutes. Thereafter, brains
were obtained, hemispheres separated and meninges were
removed from the brains. Hemispheres were dissociated
in ice-cold Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS, supplemented with 0.2% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen,
Germany), 0.01% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA,
Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany) using a Dounce
homogenizer and passed through a 40-μm nylon cell
strainer (BD Biosciences, Stockholm, Sweden). After
centrifugation at 400 × g at room temperature (rt) for
10 minutes, the pellet was resuspended in a Percoll
solution (30% in HBSS) and overlaid on a gradient of a
37% and 70% Percoll solution. The subsequent centrifugation was carried out at 500 × g at rt for 20 minutes.
Immune cells were carefully collected at the 37% to 70%
interface and washed with HBSS containing 10% FBS.

After centrifugation at 400 × g at rt for 10 minutes), cells
were resuspended in 500 μL PBS containing 0.2% BSA.

Fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis

One hundred microliters of sample obtained from brain
were used per staining panel and stained with mouse
anti rat MHC II phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated, anti rat
cluster of differentiation (CD) 11b fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated, anti rat CD11c Alexa Fluor
647 conjugated, anti rat CD45-Alexa eFluoro 700 or anti
rat MHC II PE conjugated, anti rat CD80 FITC conjugated,
and anti rat CD86 phycoerythrin cyanine 7 (PE-Cy7) and
anti rat CD11c Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated (diluted 1:200,
BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). After washing and
centrifugation at 1,006 × g for 1 minute, cells were fixed
with (Cytofix/Cytoperm™, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA) following the manufacturers protocol. Unstained cells
and fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls were used
in parallel.

Forty-eight hours after fixation, cells were analyzed
and data collected using FACSAria III and FACS Diva
software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Morphological analysis was performed by using the forward side
scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) parameters. Up to
200,000 events were acquired and FSC threshold was
set to 20,000. Data analysis was performed by using the
FlowJo (7.6.5 version, Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA)
software. Cells were morphologically identified by FSC
and SSC and doublets were discriminated and further
divided by antigen positivity in respect to unstained
cells and FMO controls (Figure 1A and B). Microglia/
macrophages and dendritic cells were identified being
CD45+ and further analyzed for CD11b and CD11c
expression. Microglia/macrophages were defined being
(CD45+CD11b+CD11c−) and dendritic cells being (CD45+
CD11b+CD11c+) according to Gelderblom et al., [19].

incubation on ice, the homogenates were centrifuged
(18,000 x g at 4°C for 20 minutes) and the supernatant
was collected for further analysis. Total protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford assay using
BSA as standard.

Preparation of protein extracts from brain tissue

Western blotting

Whole cellular protein extracts were prepared as described
previously [24]. In brief, tissue from the infarct core
was homogenized by a Dounce homogenizer in lysis
buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid
(EGTA), 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),
2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail (catalog # P2714, SigmaAldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany). After 15 minutes of

Twenty micrograms of protein were separated on a 10%
acrylamide gel. Thereafter, proteins were transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes and blocked
with a solution containing 5% non-fat dry milk, 2%
normal horse serum and 2% BSA. Following blocking,
the membranes were incubated with mouse anti rat
MHC II (Ox-6) (dilution 1:1,000, AbD Serotec GmbH,
Düsseldorf, Germany) at 4°C over night. Subsequently, the
membranes were incubated with a secondary antibody
anti mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated

Cytokine analysis from brain extracts

Brain extracts were obtained from the peri-infarct area
and the infarct core of rats subjected either to tMCAO
or sham operation, respectively, and treated either with
levodopa/benserazide (20 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline) for
12 days in total. Samples were diluted with lysis buffer and
analyzed for the following cytokines: IL-1β, chemokine
(C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), IL-4, IL-5, TNF-α, IFNγ and IL-13 by a multiplex immunoassay kit according to
manufacturer’s protocol (Mesoscale, Gaithersburg, MD,
USA) and as described previously [22].

(1:8,000, Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany) for one
hour at rt. The signals were visualized by using a chemiluminescence kit (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany)
and CCD camera (Fujifilm LAS 1000, Fujifilm, Tokyo,
Japan). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti
β-actin HRP conjugated (dilution 1:50,000, Sigma-Aldrich,
Deisenhofen, Germany).
Immunohistochemistry

Paraformaldehyde-fixed free-floating brain sections (thickness 30 μm) were used. After quenching endogenous
peroxidase activity and blocking in normal rabbit or
donkey serum, the sections were incubated with a mouse
anti rat MHC II (diluted to 1:100, AbD Serotec) at 4°C
over night. Following rinsing, the sections were incubated
with a biotinylated donkey anti mouse antibody (1:500,
Jackson ImmunoResearch, Newmarket, UK) for 90 minutes
and subsequently with avidin biotin complex (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The reaction was
carried out by the addition of 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
(Saveen and Werner, Limhamn, Sweden) supplemented
with 8% nickel chloride.
Immunofluorescence

Free-floating, paraformaldehyde-fixed brain sections, were
stained with rabbit anti rat dopamine 1 receptor (diluted
to 1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and mouse anti rat
MHC II (diluted to 1:100, AbD Serotec, Düsseldorf,
Germany) at 4°C overnight after blocking in 5% normal
serum for one hour at rt. Thereafter, sections were
incubated with secondary swine anti rabbit biotinylated
antibody (diluted to 1:400, Jackson ImmunoResearch,
Newmarket, UK) for one hour at rt, followed by incubation
with Streptavidin Alexa 488 (diluted to 1:400) and donkey
anti mouse Cy3 conjugated (diluted to 1:400, Jackson
ImmunoResearch, Newmarket, UK) for 90 minutes at rt.
Quantification of MHC II+ cells

Two coronal sections (−0.90 and −1.90 related to bregma)
per brain were stained for MHC II as described above.
Composite micrographs of the whole contralateral
hemisphere were taken by bright field microscopy
(Olympus BX61 equipped with a 10-fold objective,
Olympus Sverige AB, Solna, Sweden). The CC of the

contralateral hemisphere was defined by a medial vertical
line. MHC II+ cells were counted in the entire CC.
Statistics

Flow cytometry and cytokine data are displayed as mean ±
standard error of the means and tested with analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Bonferroni correction or
Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test unless otherwise specified using SPSS™ version 21 (IBM, Stockholm,
Sweden). Differences in the number of MHC II+ cells and
levels of MHC II were tested with Student’s t-test. In all
experiments P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Dynamics of MHC II+ cells in the postischemic brain after
levodopa/benserazide treatment

To evaluate the spatiotemporal expression of immune
cell accumulation rats were subjected to tMCAO for
105 minutes and at different time points coronal sections
were stained for MHC II, a protein expressed on different
immune cell populations [25]. As shown in Figure 2, we
observed very few scattered and ramified cells in brains
of sham operated rats. In contrast, an accumulation of
ameboid cells was evident in the ischemic territory
during the first four days after tMCAO. At later time
points (7 days, 14 days and 30 days), MHC II+ cells in
the ischemic territory consistently displayed a ramified
morphology (Figure 2).
Among other cell types [15,16], dopamine 1 (D1) receptors are expressed on a number of MHC II+ cells in the
ischemic territory (Figure 3A) strongly suggesting that
MHC II cells are regulated by treatment with levodopa.
Indeed, analysis of MHC II protein from the ischemic core
region showed a significant reduction in rats treated with
levodopa (5 mg/kg)/benserazide (15 mg/kg) on day 14
after tMCAO (tMCAO VH 1.35 ± 0.17, tMCAO LD 0.98 ±
0.08; arbitrary units) (Figure 3B). This was accompanied
by a significant reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines
IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-4 in the ischemic hemisphere known
to induce MHC II expression [26,27] (Figure 3D to F).
Delayed accumulation of immune cells and expression
of MHC II protein in the postischemic brain prompted us
to perform flow cytometry analysis of immune cells in
brain tissues of rats one week after tMCAO. Figures 4A

in the ischemic but also the contralateral hemisphere
(absolute numbers of cells are shown in Table 1). The
majority of MHC II+ cells in the ischemic and contralateral

hemisphere were identified as microglia/macrophages by
the expression of CD45 and CD11b, (CD11b+CD45+MHC
II+) (Figure 4C and D, Table 1). Treatment with levodopa/

was defined by the antigens MHCII, CD11b, CD11c and
CD45, respectively, and was identified as myeloid dendritic
cells in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere
(Figure 4E and F). A significant portion of MHC II+ cells
co-expressed the stimulatory molecules CD86 (Figure 4G
and H) and CD80 (Figure 4I and J) necessary for the
effector cell response upon interaction between immune
cells, suggesting that these cells represent professional
antigen presenting cells (APCs).
Interestingly, further analysis of brain sections revealed
the selective appearance of MHC II+ cells in the CC
contralateral to the ischemic hemisphere (Figure 5). Cell
accumulation was detectable as early as 4 days after stroke
onset and onwards and cells were present until the study
endpoint at 30 days after tMCAO. No differences between
animal strains were observed on day 14 after stroke
(data not shown). Cells displayed a ramified morphology
and were mostly present in the CC. However, scattered
positive cells were also found in the striatum of the
contralateral hemisphere. Quantification revealed a higher
number of MHC II+ cells in rats treated with levodopa/
benserazide (399 ± 66 cells, saline treatment 216 ± 45 cells,
Figure 6A). Importantly, the number of MHC II+ cells in
the contralateral CC did not correlate with the infarct
volume (Figure 6B) and thus not the size of injury.
These results illustrate that the delayed cellular inflammatory response involving MHC II+ cells includes the
contralateral callosum, a brain region rich in axonal fibers
and connecting both hemispheres, after stroke.

Discussion
In the present study we investigated if treatment with
levodopa/benserazide affects delayed inflammation after
stroke, which is the number of MHC II+ cells and levels of
pro-inflammatory molecules in the postischemic brain.
We found that MHC II+ cells accumulate in the ischemic
hemisphere independent from the treatment while levodopa/benserazide treatment significantly downregulated
MHC II proteins in the ischemic territory. Moreover, we
detected a delayed accumulation of MHC II+ cells in the
CC ipsi- and contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere and
found that the number of these cells in the contralateral
CC is increased by the treatment.

Dynamics of immune cell accumulation in the
postischemic brain - influence of levodopa treatment

Our studies show that treatment with levodopa/benserazide is effective in two rat strains subjected to tMCAO.
Moreover, postischemic immune cell accumulation to
the brain observed in vehicle-treated Sprague Dawley
rats subjected to tMCAO are similar to those found in
Wistar rats subjected to tMCAO [23]; hence, the time of
occlusion necessary to obtain similar lesions differed
between the strains. Both strains have been compared in
experimental stroke models [28,29]. A higher variability
of lesions was observed in Wistar rats subjected to
photothrombosis and in Sprague Dawley rats subjected
to tMCAO with a higher survival rate after the insult.
We have extensively tested times of MCA occlusion in
both rat strains and similar lesions and functional deficits
were obtained using 120 minutes in Wistar rats and
105 minutes in Sprague Dawley rats. While Wistar rats
showed a high variability in lesion size, consistent infarctions and higher survival rates were observed in Sprague
Dawley rats. Consistent and large lesions are essential to
obtain a sufficient inflammatory response including the
accumulation of high enough immune cell counts from
individual animals.
Based on immunohistochemistry and FACS analysis we
could confirm a delayed accumulation of MHC II+ cells in
the postischemic brain after tMCAO [21] and show that
the majority of MHC II+ cells are microglia/macrophages
identified by co-expression of CD11b and CD45 [5]. Only
a minority of the MHC II+ cell population was identified as
dendritic cells. A portion of MHC II+ cells co-expressed
CD80 or CD86, molecules necessary for signal transduction
between immune cells and identifying these cells as professional antigen presenting cells [30]. Our findings are in
contrast to a recent study demonstrating a widespread
invasion of dendritic cells expressing the co-stimulatory
molecule CD80 after tMCAO. Differences might be due
to species differences and the use of a CD11c driven
enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) as an overall
dendritic cell marker [31].
Additional immunofluorescence analyses showed that a
number of MHC II+ cells express D1 receptors emphasizing their susceptibility to levodopa treatment. Together

Figure 6 Effect of levodopa/benserazide treatment on MHC II+ cells in the corpus callosum (CC) after tMCAO. (A) Number of MHC II+
cells in the CC contralateral to the lesioned hemisphere of rats treated with vehicle (n = 7) or levodopa/benserazide (n = 6). Data are presented as
means ± SEM and statistical difference was tested with the Student’s t-test, P < 0.05. (B) Correlation between infarct volume presented in mm3
and the absolute number of MHC II+ cells. Abbreviations: VH, vehicle; LD, levodopa/benserazide.

with the lack of D2 and D3 receptor expression (data not
shown) this finding supports mechanisms dependent
on the activation of D1 receptors in these cells. Our
experiments showed different effects of levodopa/benserazide treatment in regard to the levels of MHC II
proteins and the number of MHC II+ cells in the lesioned
hemisphere. While MHC II proteins were significantly
downregulated we found no differences in the number
of MHC II+ cells between vehicle and levodopa/benserazide-treated animals. The expression of MHC II molecules
depends on presentation of antigens to immune cells such
as microglia and involves the activation of intracellular
signalling cascades in respective cells [32]. On the other
hand, even with a very low number of MHC II molecules
presented on the surface, cells were determined as
MHC II+. The findings are not contradictory because
also low numbers of MHC II molecules found in levodopa/benserazide-treated rats are presented on the
cell surface and, therefore, these cells were counted as
MHC II+. Hence, this assumption is only valid if no
differences in posttranslational intracellular transport,
integration of MHC II molecules on the cell surface
and the same overall accumulation of immune cells in
the lesioned hemisphere exist as shown in Figure 4.
The two approaches to assess MHC II, therefore, can
only be considered as complementary.
The regulation of MHC II expression in microglial cells
has not been investigated in detail. It has been shown that
infusion of IFN-γ increases the expression of MHC II in
microglia [33]. Thus, long-term suppression of IFN-γ in
the ischemic hemisphere by levodopa/benserazide treatment may downregulate MHC II proteins. A possible
mechanism to reduce the expression of MHC II molecules
by dopamine signaling might be via inhibitory actions
of the protein kinase A (PKA). As previously shown,

activation of D1 receptors leads to phosphorylation of
PKA [34] which subsequently inhibits CIITA, a positive
regulator of MHC II gene transcription [35].
Pro-inflammatory cytokines are also expressed in other
resident brain cells such as neurons or astrocytes [36,37].
Treatment with levodopa/benserazide also has effects
on the function of these cells expressing dopamine receptors including a reduction of cytokine release. Paracrine
communication of cells in turn may affect surrounding
immune cells such as MHC II+ cells. Taken together,
our results point towards immunomodulatory effects
involving the expression of MHC II molecules by levodopa treatment in the postischemic brain, possibly by a
reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Putative functions of MHC II+ cells in the corpus callosum

The CC represents one of the principal connections in the
communication between the two hemispheres [8]. Here,
for the first time we describe the delayed accumulation
of MHC II+ cells in the CC of the ipsi- and contralateral
hemisphere after tMCAO. Further characterization by
FACS analysis revealed that the majority of these cells are
CD11b+ microglia. In addition, we identified a small portion of cells co-expressing CD11b and CD11c indicative
for myeloid dendritic cells [19]. A possible functional
relevance of these cells might be that due to ischemic
injury, anterograde as well as retrograde degeneration of
neuronal fibers takes place, and accumulation of MHC II+
cells might either perpetuate neurodegeneration or provide
a protective/trophic support to neurons [38]. Quantification of MHC II+ cells in the contralateral CC showed an
increased number of cells in animals treated with levodopa/benserazide independent from the infarct volume
which was not affected by the treatment [16]. Since MHC
II+ cells appear ramified and activated [39] and do not

display an ameboid phagocyte-like morphology, as observed in the infarct core, a neurotrophic function and
support in remyelination might be possible [36]. Hence,
we cannot exclude phagocytosis of cellular debris.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that dopamine
attenuates the inflammatory response in the ischemic
hemisphere. In addition, our data show an accumulation
of MHC II+ cells in the CC of the hemisphere contralateral and ipsilateral to the ischemic lesion. Interestingly,
the number of cells was significantly elevated by treatment with levodopa/benserazide suggesting that these
cells exert beneficial actions contributing to recovery
after stroke. Together, both components of dopamine
actions might be exploited in future recovery-enhancing
stroke therapies.
