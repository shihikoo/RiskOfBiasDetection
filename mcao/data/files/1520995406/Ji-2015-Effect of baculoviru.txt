ABSTRACT. We explored the effect of baculovirus P35 protein on
apoptosis in the brain tissue of rats with acute cerebral infarction (ACI).
A rat model of middle cerebral artery infarction was created. The
rats were randomly divided into sham, model, and treatment groups.
Baculovirus P35 protein was injected into the intracranial arteries of the
treatment group rats. The rats in the model group were given an equal
volume of phosphate-buffered saline. The rats were sacrificed after 72
h and the brain tissue was separated. The levels of caspase-3, Bcl-2,
and Bax mRNA, the brain cell apoptosis index, and the infarct size
were determined. After 72 h, the levels of caspase-3 and Bax mRNA in
the model and treatment groups were significantly greater than in the
sham group, and the levels of Bcl-2 mRNA were significantly smaller
(P < 0.05). The levels of caspase-3 and Bax mRNA were significantly
lower in the treatment group than in the model group, and the level of
Bcl-2 mRNA was significantly greater (P < 0.05). Compared with the
sham group, the brain tissue apoptosis index and the cerebral infarction
area increased significantly in the model and treatment groups (P <
0.05). The brain tissue apoptosis index and cerebral infarction area in
the treatment group were significantly lower than in the model group

INTRODUCTION
Acute cerebral infarction (ACI) is a common clinical cardiovascular, cerebrovascular,
and nervous system disease in the elderly. The incidence and mortality rates are high, and it
has become a serious threat to human health. The pathological basis of ACI is as follows:
acute cerebral ischemia occurs, focal cerebral microvascular endothelial cells are damaged,
and the function of the blood-brain barrier is lost; thus, cell apoptosis and necrosis occur in
the focal ischemic cerebral tissue (Hsieh and Chiou, 2014; Mokin et al., 2014). In the acute
phase of cerebral infarction, neurons in the central belt of the ischemic region experience irreversible necrosis within several minutes. The corresponding symptoms of neural function
defects appear, leading to neuron apoptosis and loss of biological function. Therefore, cell
apoptosis plays an important role in the occurrence and development of acute cerebral infarction. Domestic and international research has shown that apoptosis levels in cerebral cells and
neurons significantly increase in patients with ACI or in the cerebral tissue of animal models
(Cevik et al., 2013; Olavarría et al., 2014). The baculoviruses were among the first viruses
in which the ability to regulate the apoptosis behavior of the host was discovered. Research
into the genes involved in apoptosis regulation could dramatically extend our understanding
of the biological effects and molecular mechanisms of apoptosis caused by viral infection.
The discoveries of the baculovirus P35 gene and P35 protein are important achievements in
the field of anti-apoptosis. Their role in anti-apoptosis was discovered earlier this century and
their wide-ranging effects have attracted researchers’ attention (Sahdev et al., 2010; Tian et al.,
2010). Research has shown that the P35 protein can react with a certain conserved component
in the apoptosis pathway, namely caspase. The P35 protein can directly inhibit active caspase
and the activation of caspase in vivo. The research confirmed that caspase is also the central
link in the apoptosis pathway. The P35 protein can inhibit the activities of caspase-1, -3, -6, -7,
-8, and -10 in mammals. Caspase-3 can interact on the cell surface and play an important role
in the mediation of cell apoptosis owing to its involvement in the receptor and mitochondrial
apoptosis pathways (Yu, 2011; Yang et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2014). Based on the above theories, this study explored the inhibitory effect of baculovirus P35 protein on caspase-3 in the
brain tissue of rats with ACI and cell apoptosis at an animal level. We aimed to provide a new
therapeutic approach for the clinical treatment of ACI.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Establishment of ACI model and grouping
Sprague Dawley rats (180-200 g) were purchased from the animal center of LAIKE
Co., Shanghai, China. The rat models of the middle cerebral artery infarction were created
using the Longa method (Yang et al., 2013). The rats showed listlessness, Horner’s syndrome

on the same side, drooping of the contralateral forelimb, adduction and internal rotation, and
spontaneous circling on the affected side for 2 h after the operation, which illustrated that
model creation had been successful. If model creation failed, the rat was eliminated.
The experiment was divided into three groups: sham, model, and treatment groups,
with 20 rats in each group. In the sham operation group, the vessel was separated but there
was no suture occlusion. The rats in the model and treatment groups were operated on according to the model creation method. After the rats had been monitored for 3 h to verify the success of the model creation, the rats in the treatment group were immediately injected in their
tail veins with 30 mg/kg baculovirus P35 protein. The rats in the model and sham operation
groups were given an intravenous injection of an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline.
All indices were detected after 72 h. This study was performed in strict accordance with the
recom­mendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National
Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA), 8th Edition, 2010. The animal use protocol has
been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
of Xinxiang Central Hospital.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
The rats in the three groups were killed and brain tissue (0.1 g) was removed. The total
RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer instructions of the RNA extract kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). The brain tissue was transferred to pre-cooled mortar. Liquid nitrogen
was added to grind into powder. Cell lysate (400 mL) was added. After the samples had been
repeatedly aspirated using a syringe with a No. 21-25 needle 8-10 times, they were transferred
to a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube (provided with the kit). Neutralization solution (150 mL) was
added and the samples underwent vortex oscillation for 15-30 s, followed by centrifugation
at 12,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed to a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube. Isopropanol (250 mL) was added and uniformly mixed. In accordance with the kit manufacturer
instructions, the subsequent steps followed the centrifugal method. The evenly mixed liquid
was transferred to a preparation tube, which was placed in a 2-mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 6000 g for 1 min at 4°C. The filtrate was discarded. The preparation tube was placed
back in the 2-mL centrifuge tube. Washing liquid (500 mL) was added and the sample was
centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 min. The filtrate was discarded. The preparation tube was placed
back in the 2-mL centrifuge tube. Desalination solution (700 mL) was added to the preparation
tube, which was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 min. The steps were repeated and the filtrate
was discarded. The preparation tube was placed back in the 2-mL centrifuge tube, which was
centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 min. The preparation tube was placed into the 1.5-mL centrifuge
tube. Eluent (70-100 mL) was added to the center of the preparation tube, which was kept at
room temperature for 1 min, centrifuged at 12,000 g for 1 min, and washed to obtain the RNA.
The following primers were designed according to the mRNA sequences of caspase-3,
Bcl-2, and Bax provided by GeneBank: caspase-3-F: 5'-GGTATTGAGACAGACAGTGG-3';
caspase-3-R: 5'-CATGGGATCTGTTTCTTTGC-3'; β-actin-F: 5'-GCGGGAAATCGTGCGT
GAC-3'; β-actin-R: 5'-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTG-3'. The primers were diluted to 10
µM. First, the specificity and annealing temperatures of the primers were optimized. Then,
the following reaction systems were prepared: 10 µL 2X SYBR Green general type quantitative PCR (qPCR) Master Mix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), each with 0.6 µL upstream/
downstream primers (10 µM) and 8.8 µL 1:100 diluted cDNA. The total reaction volume was

20 µL. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 2000 g. The PCR was carried out as follows:
pre-degeneration at 95°C for 30 s; degeneration at 95°C for 3 s; and annealing extension at
60°C for 30 s, for 30 cycles. The dissolution curve was constructed. Finally, the data were
directly read from the ABI 7500 real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR instrument (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling
(TUNEL)-staining method
The brain tissue slices of sacrificed rats from the three groups were taken, dewaxed
by antigen repairing, and washed with PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with Tween 20) three
times. The operation was carried out strictly according to the manufacturer instructions provided with the TUNEL kit (Roche). The magnification of the specimens was 400X. Ten visual
fields were randomly selected in the infarction area and surrounding regions. The brain cell
apoptosis index was calculated from the proportion of apoptotic cells.

2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) analysis
After the rats had been sacrificed, the olfactory bulb, the cerebellum, and the brainstem were resected. The remaining tissue was made into coronal sections. The sections were
placed into 2% TTC phosphate buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and stained at 37°C for
20 min. They were then fixed using paraformaldehyde. The normal tissue was red and the
infarction tissue was white; the infarction tissue was separated from the normal brain tissue
under a microscope. The wet mass of the normal and infarction tissues was determined using
an analytical balance. The infarction range was the infarction tissue mass expressed as a percentage of the total tissue mass.

Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using the SPSS 17 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA). The measured data are reported as means ± SD. The measured data were compared
by analysis of variance between multiple groups. Comparisons between pairs of groups were
carried out using the least significant difference method. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
Change of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax mRNA levels in the rat brain tissue
The levels of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax mRNA in the brain tissue of the rats in the
three groups were analyzed by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. The results showed
that, compared with the sham group, the levels of caspase-3 and Bax mRNA increased significantly in the model and treatment groups (P < 0.05), while the level of Bcl-2 mRNA decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Compared with the model group, the levels of caspase-3 and
Bax mRNA decreased significantly in the treatment group (P < 0.05), while the level of Bcl-2
mRNA increased significantly (P < 0.05; Figure 1).

DISCUSSION
In ACI, depending on the degree of ischemia and hypoxia, necrosis and apoptosis may
occur in the cells. The cells in the ischemic core area soon die as a result of serious hypoxia
and ischemia for an extended period. It is an irreversible process. In the ischemic penumbra

region, located around the ischemic focus, the degree of ischemia is relatively low. In addition,
collateral circulation is established in time. A certain blood perfusion can be maintained after
ischemic injury for a certain period of time. Although normal physiological function cannot
be maintained, synthesis of some proteins and expression of some genes is possible. The route
to cell death is usually cell apoptosis. Even if the function is damaged, it is still a reversible
process. If the protective effects of a drug take effect in time, the apoptosis will be reduced, but
the process of cell death will also be delayed. Once the blood supply is restored, death can be
avoided. Otherwise, irreversible death will occur and the focal infarction will gradually extend
to the surrounding tissue (Higgins et al., 2014; Power et al., 2014).
The P35 protein is an encoded protein that exhibits anti-apoptotic activity after the
baculovirus invades host cells. It can inhibit cell apoptosis in mammalian, insect, and nemathelminth species, and is a widely effective inhibitor of apoptosis. Research has shown that
P35 protein can combine the conserved constituent caspase in the apoptosis pathway and
interact with it so as to inhibit its activity (Guy and Friesen, 2008; Brand et al., 2012). In vitro
study results have shown that the P35 protein can form a complex that has steric stability with
respect to its target molecules and can inhibit the activity of caspase in a competitive binding
mode. Moreover, the P35 protein can be cut by the target caspase at a specific location; the
P35 protein can then combine with caspase more strongly after cutting. The cleavage product
can form the CED-3/ICE-P35 complex with CED-3/ICE protease, thereby inhibiting the action of CED-3/ICE, and further inhibiting cell apoptosis. Caspase-3, which is a member of the
cysteine protease family, is the key enzyme involved in cell apoptosis. It can activate the cell
apoptosis pathway by degrading intracellular substrates, which leads to cell apoptosis. Therefore, it is called a “molecular switch”. A large number of experimental studies have shown
that caspase-3 plays an important role in the pathological process of myocardial and cerebral
ischemia. It has attracted a great deal of attention, mainly for its role in the final common pathway of apoptosis (Yu et al., 2006; Kester and Nambu, 2011). The results of this study showed
that the expression level of caspase-3 mRNA decreased significantly after the P35 protein was
injected into the rats with ACI, which further confirms that the P35 protein has a certain inhibitory effect on the apoptosis pathway of brain tissue in rats following treatment.
The Bcl-2 family has the main switching role in regulating the cell death signaling
pathway. Under normal conditions, the expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bax are relatively stable. However, when Bax is overexpressed, the number of Bax dimers increases significantly,
the cells are stimulated, and apoptosis is initiated. When Bcl-2 is highly expressed, the Bax
dimers dissociate and form more stable Bcl-2 and Bax complexes, resulting in cellular life
extension (Walensky, 2006; Liang et al., 2014; Pan et al., 2014). Therefore, the proportion of
Bcl-2/Bax plays an important role in maintaining the cell survival process. The results of this
study showed that after the P35 protein was injected, the level of Bcl-2 mRNA significantly
increased in the brain tissue of rats with ACI, while the level of Bax mRNA decreased significantly, so that the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was more conducive to the survival of cells. It has
been confirmed that the P35 protein can reduce the expression of Bax, thereby inhibiting cell
apoptosis. In addition, the analysis results of the overall apoptosis level and infarction range
in the brain tissue of the rats showed that the cell apoptosis ratio was significantly lower than
in the model group after treatment with the P35 protein. Although the ratio was still significantly higher than that in the sham operation group, the P35 protein protected brain tissue to
a large extent.

In short, baculovirus P35 protein can significantly inhibit cell apoptosis in the brain
tissue of rats with ACI. This provides a solid theoretical basis for the use of P35 protein in the
treatment of acute myocardial infarction.
