Hyperoxia has been uniformly efficacious in experimental focal cerebral ischemia. However, pilot clinical trials have showed mixed
results slowing its translation in patient care. To explain the discordance between experimental and clinical outcomes, we tested the
impact of endothelial dysfunction, exceedingly common in stroke patients but under-represented in experimental studies, on the neuroprotective efficacy of normobaric hyperoxia. We used hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E knock-out and endothelial nitric oxide synthase
knock-out mice as models of endothelial dysfunction, and examined the effects of normobaric hyperoxia on tissue perfusion and
oxygenation using high-resolution combined laser speckle and multispectral reflectance imaging during distal middle cerebral artery
occlusion. In normal wild-type mice, normobaric hyperoxia rapidly and significantly improved tissue perfusion and oxygenation, suppressed peri-infarct depolarizations, reduced infarct volumes, and improved neurological function. In contrast, normobaric hyperoxia
worsened perfusion in ischemic brain and failed to reduce infarct volumes or improve neurological function in mice with endothelial
dysfunction. These data suggest that the beneficial effects of hyperoxia on ischemic tissue oxygenation, perfusion, and outcome are
critically dependent on endothelial nitric oxide synthase function. Therefore, vascular risk factors associated with endothelial dysfunction may predict normobaric hyperoxia nonresponders in ischemic stroke. These data may have implications for myocardial and
systemic circulation as well.

Introduction
Improving brain tissue oxygenation by supplemental O2 inhalation, either through a high-flow mask (i.e., normobaric) or in a
pressure chamber (i.e., hyperbaric), is a potential therapeutic
strategy in acute stroke. In contrast to hyperbaric hyperoxia
(HBO), which has limited feasibility in the hyperacute setting,
normobaric hyperoxia (NBO) can be rapidly initiated in the field
within minutes after stroke onset. Although animal studies have
firmly established the neuroprotective efficacy of NBO in ischemic stroke (Flynn and Auer, 2002; Singhal et al., 2002a; Kim et
al., 2005; Shin et al., 2007; W. Liu et al., 2011), pilot human
studies have yielded contradictory results (Anderson et al., 1991;

Nighoghossian et al., 1995; Rusyniak et al., 2003; Singhal et al.,
2005; Chiu et al., 2006). While one pilot NBO trial suggested an
improvement in outcome (Singhal et al., 2005), a second and
larger study failed to show a benefit (Padma et al., 2010). In a
large multicenter retrospective cohort, arterial hyperoxia was independently associated with higher mortality in ventilated stroke
patients (Rincon et al., 2014). Trials of HBO in acute ischemic
stroke were equally disappointing. In one pilot HBO trial, there
was no benefit, and in two others normoxic groups appeared to
fare better than the hyperoxic groups (Anderson et al., 1991;
Rusyniak et al., 2003). Indeed, a randomized trial of NBO was
terminated early due to higher mortality in the hyperoxia group
(http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00414726). Although worse
outcomes were judged to be unrelated to hyperoxia treatment per
se, data clearly suggest a discord between animal studies and
clinical trials.
Protective mechanism(s) of NBO in ischemic stroke are
poorly understood. In addition to the well documented improvement in O2 availability and metabolism in ischemic tissue (S. Liu
et al., 2004; Shin et al., 2007; Singhal et al., 2007; Baskerville et al.,
2011; Sun et al., 2011), hyperoxia has been reported to preserve
the blood– brain barrier and diminish ischemic edema (Veltkamp et al., 2005; W. Liu et al., 2009b, 2011), implicating a vascular endothelial site of action. Indeed, we and others have shown

Shin et al. • Endothelial Dysfunction, Hyperoxia, and Stroke

that NBO rapidly improves ischemic tissue perfusion as one
mechanism of neuroprotection (Nakajima et al., 1983; Jimènez et
al., 2001; Shin et al., 2007; Baskerville et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012).
How supplemental O2 augments tissue perfusion to provide an
acute cerebral hemodynamic benefit is unknown.
Stroke often occurs in individuals with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are associated with endothelial dysfunction
defined as deficient vascular reactivity due to insufficient endothelial production of nitric oxide. While endothelial dysfunction
is exceedingly common in stroke patients enrolled in clinical trials, it is rarely represented in animal studies of stroke. Therefore,
we hypothesized that improved ischemic tissue perfusion afforded by hyperoxia is dependent on normal endothelial function and critical for tissue outcome. We tested this using
endothelial nitric oxide synthase knock-out (eNOS KO) and hyperlipidemic apolipoprotein E knock-out (ApoE KO) mice as
models of endothelial dysfunction (Bonthu et al., 1997; d’Uscio et
al., 2001a; Kitayama et al., 2007). Systemic and cerebrovascular
endothelial dysfunction have already been extensively characterized in the ApoE KO, including cranial window preparations
directly interrogating the pial arteries and arterioles that are critical for collateral flow in focal ischemia (Bonthu et al., 1997;
Laursen et al., 2001; d’Uscio et al., 2001a,b; Ozaki et al., 2002;
Kitayama et al., 2007). We recently showed reduced resting cerebral blood flow (CBF), impaired cerebrovascular reflexes, and
enlarged perfusion defects in the ApoE KO on high-fat diet
(HFD; Ayata et al., 2013). HFD alone has also been shown to
impair endothelial function in otherwise normal rats (W. Li et al.,
2013). The eNOS KO, by the very nature of the genetic defect, also
has impaired endothelial function (P. L. Huang et al., 1995). The
data we present herein using these animal models strongly suggest that normal endothelial function is requisite for NBO efficacy in focal ischemia, and may explain the clinical failure of
NBO.

Materials and Methods
Experimental animals. All experimental procedures were performed in
accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH
Publication No. 85-23, 1996), and were approved by the institutional
review board (MGH Subcommittee on Research Animal Care, SRAC).
Wild-type (C57BL/6J), and ApoE KO and eNOS KO mice on a C57BL/6J
genetic background (The Jackson Laboratory), were housed under diurnal lighting conditions and allowed food and tap water ad libitum. We
used only male mice to build upon the previous mutant studies of endothelial dysfunction, and to avoid the potentially confounding effects of
female gonadal hormones on stroke outcome (Hurn and Macrae, 2000)
at this proof-of-concept stage. A subgroup of wild-type mice, and all
ApoE KO mice, were fed a Western-type HFD (42% of total calories from
fat; 0.15% cholesterol; Harlan Teklad) for 8 weeks starting at 4 weeks of
age. We have recently shown that ApoE KO at this age and HFD duration
develops early stage atherosclerotic lesions limited to scattered subendothelial foam cells in carotid arteries, and mild fatty streaks in the proximal
aortic arch, without flow-limiting stenoses, which might pose a physical
barrier and reduce the perfusion pressure as a confounder (Ayata et al.,
2013).
Distal middle cerebral artery occlusion. Mice were anesthetized with 2%
isoflurane (in 70% N2O and 30% O2). Femoral artery was catheterized
for the measurement of BP (ETH 400 transducer amplifier). Rectal temperature was kept at 36.8 –37.1°C using a thermostatically controlled
heating mat (FHC). Mice were paralyzed (pancuronium bromide, 0.4
mg/kg/h, i.p.), mechanically ventilated (CWE, SAR-830), and placed in a
stereotaxic frame (David Kopf). In survival experiments to measure infarct volume at 48 h, morbidity and mortality precluded neuromuscular
paralysis, intubation, and ventilation. Arterial blood gases and pH were
measured in all mice every 30 min (Corning 178 blood gas/pH analyzer;

J. Neurosci., November 12, 2014 • 34(46):15200 –15207 • 15201

Ciba Corning Diagnostics). These data were continuously recorded using a data acquisition and analysis system (PowerLab; AD Instruments)
and stored in a computer. Mice were allowed to stabilize for 30 min after
surgical preparation.
Distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) was induced as previously described (Ayata et al., 2013). After general surgical preparation,
mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame, and skull surface was prepared
for optical imaging. The temporalis muscle was separated from the temporal bone and a burr hole (2 mm diameter) was drilled under saline
cooling over the distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) just above the zygomatic arch. The dura was kept intact and MCA was occluded using a
microvascular clip.
We studied the spatiotemporal characteristics of CBF changes during
dMCAO using laser speckle flowmetry (LSF) noninvasively through intact skull, as described in detail previously (Ayata et al., 2004). The severity of CBF deficit was analyzed two-dimensionally by quantifying the area
of the hypoperfused cortex using a thresholding paradigm (pixels with
residual CBF ⱕ20% or ⱕ30% of the pre-ischemic baseline, expressed in
mm 2). In addition, we studied changes in tissue oxygenation using multispectral reflectance imaging, as previously described in detail (Shin et
al., 2007; Yuzawa et al., 2012). A region of interest was placed in ischemic
penumbra to measure changes in oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin
concentrations over time during dMCAO. Hemoglobin saturation
(satHb) was calculated as oxyhemoglobin/(oxyhemoglobin ⫹ deoxyhemoglobin) and expressed as percentage of baseline.
The impact of NBO on infarct volume was determined in a separate
group of mice without intubation or mechanical ventilation, since these
surgical procedures significantly increase morbidity and mortality during the recovery period. To determine infarct volume, microvascular clip
was carefully removed after 75 min of dMCAO, and successful reperfusion confirmed using LSF; animals without reperfusion or with hemorrhage during clip removal were excluded from the study. Mice were killed
48 h after ischemia. In pilot studies we determined that 48 h time point
captures the maximum infarct volume after dMCAO and reduces the
confounding effect of ischemic brain edema that becomes significant at
72 h (data not shown). After dMCAO, whole brains were incubated in
2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma) solution (1 g/50
ml saline) for 60 min. After photographing the hemispheric surface,
brains were cut into 1-mm-thick coronal sections, and infarct area at
each section was measured and integrated along the anteroposterior axis
to calculate infarct volume (mm 3). Relatively small infarct volumes in
this pure cortical stroke model precluded correction for ischemic swelling (i.e., indirect method). The viability threshold for CBF was calculated
by spatially overlapping the laser speckle flow maps and the TTC infarct,
and determining the residual CBF at the infarct edge, as described in
detail previously (Eikermann-Haerter et al., 2012; Ayata et al., 2013).
Imaging was started 5 min before dMCAO and continued uninterrupted for 75 min. Normoxia group was maintained on 30% O2, whereas
in the NBO group, the fraction of oxygen in inspired air was increased to
100% 15 min after dMCAO. In survival experiments to assess infarct
volume, mice were allowed to breathe room air at the time of reperfusion
at 75 min, and killed 48 h after dMCAO onset.
Filament middle cerebral artery occlusion. A nylon monofilament was
inserted into the internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery
followed by reperfusion after 60 min under isoflurane anesthesia (2.5%
induction, 1.5% maintenance, in 70% N2O and 30% O2) and laser Doppler monitoring as previously described (Eikermann-Haerter et al., 2012).
Mice were then placed in a temperature-controlled incubator with easy
access to food and water. Neurological outcomes were graded 24 h after
reperfusion as follows: 0, normal; 1, forepaw monoparesis; 2, circling to
right; 3, falling to right; 4, no spontaneous walking and depressed consciousness; and 5, death. In addition, a composite neurological score was
adopted to assess spontaneous activity (0 –3), limb movement (0 –3),
climbing (0 –3), and balance (0 –3) for a total score of 12 in normal mice,
as described previously (Parra et al., 2002). Brains were cut into 1-mmthick coronal sections and incubated in 2% TTC solution for 30 min.
Infarct volume was calculated by subtracting the volume of the ipsilateral
noninfarcted tissue from the contralateral hemisphere at each section
level integrated along the anteroposterior axis (i.e., indirect method) to

eliminate the contribution of ischemic swelling. The 24 h time point was
chosen for assessment after filament MCAO (fMCAO) due to relatively
high mortality after 24 h in this model.
Experimental groups and data analysis. For dMCAO, normoxia or
NBO was instituted in WT, WT on HFD (WT ⫹ HFD), ApoE KO on
HFD (ApoE KO ⫹ HFD), and eNOS KO. For fMCAO, normoxia or
NBO was instituted in WT and eNOS KO. In the absence of suitable pilot
data, initial sample sizes empirically targeted at least 80% power to detect
a 35% difference between the groups with an SD of 25% of the mean.
Final sample sizes were based on power calculations in these initial cohorts. Mice were randomly assigned (coin flip) to normoxia or hyperoxia
groups. HFD caused characteristic fur changes that precluded effective
blinding during data acquisition; allocation was concealed during subsequent endpoint assessments. A priori exclusion criteria included technical failure to successfully occlude (i.e., CBF ⱕ20% of baseline) or
reperfuse (i.e., CBF ⱖ50% of baseline) the middle cerebral artery without
hemorrhage. In the eNOS KO only, we experienced difficulty in inserting
the filament to achieve successful occlusion. As a result, 13 of 25 mice
were excluded due to insufficient CBF reduction or subarachnoid hemorrhage as technical failures.
Data are expressed as box-whisker plots in which individual data

Results
Systemic physiology
NBO raised arterial pO2 to a range of 300 – 400 mmHg, but otherwise did not significantly impact other systemic physiological
parameters (Fig. 1). Arterial BP was significantly higher in ApoE
KO ⫹ HFD and eNOS KO groups compared with WT. Otherwise, arterial pH, pCO2, and pO2 were all within normal limits.
Last, HFD significantly increased body weight in both WT and
ApoE KO mice, and eNOS KO showed a small but significant
reduction in body weight compared with WT.
CBF and oxygenation
Upon dMCAO, a focal area of hypoperfusion developed over the
dorsolateral cortex (Fig. 2A). Institution of NBO in WT mice
improved ischemic tissue perfusion and diminished the area of
perfusion defect by almost 50% (Fig. 2B, green arrows), as described previously (Shin et al., 2007). In all other groups, NBO
failed to improve the perfusion, and indeed markedly worsened it
in eNOS KO mice (⬃40% increase in the area of perfusion defect;
Fig. 2B, red arrows).
In WT mice, NBO significantly improved ischemic tissue
oxygenation (Fig. 2C, green arrows). This effect was diminished in WT and ApoE KO mice on HFD, and completely
absent in the eNOS KO. The hemodynamic improvement in
the WT and worsening in the eNOS KO were not a consequence of reverse steal from the mildly ischemic cortex, where
NBO did not alter CBF in the WT, and significantly reduced it
in the eNOS KO (Fig. 2D, red arrows).

Infarct volume
Consistent with its effects on tissue perfusion and oxygenation,
NBO reduced infarct volume by almost 50% when measured 48 h
after dMCAO (Fig. 3 A, B). In all other groups, NBO did not
significantly reduce infarct volume, and indeed tended to worsen
it in the eNOS KO.
Peri-infarct depolarizations
We have previously shown that NBO suppresses peri-infarct depolarizations (PIDs) as an additional mechanism of neuroprotection in

focal cerebral ischemia (Shin et al., 2007). Therefore, we tested
whether NBO still inhibits PID occurrence in the presence of endothelial dysfunction. We detected PIDs using the characteristic CBF
transients on laser speckle imaging as a sensitive and specific surro-

gate (Shin et al., 2006, 2007; Strong et al., 2006; Eikermann-Haerter
et al., 2012). In the WT, NBO once again reduced PID frequencies
(Fig. 3C). This effect was diminished in all other groups, in part due
to a direct effect of HFD on PID frequency (see below).

Viability threshold
To determine whether improved tissue perfusion by NBO is
solely responsible for reduced infarct volumes, we calculated the
CBF threshold for viability in each group. NBO decreased the
viability threshold as a treatment effect across the entire cohort.
However, in post hoc analysis statistical significance was reached
only in the ApoE KO ⫹ HFD group. These data suggest that in the
presence of NBO, cortical tissue requires lower levels of CBF to
survive 75 min of dMCAO (Fig. 3D).
Neurological function
To test whether the effect of NBO on infarct volumes is also
reflected in functional outcomes, we performed 1 h transient
fMCAO and examined the motor function 24 h later. In WT
mice, NBO significantly improved both the infarct volumes and
neurological function compared with normoxic group (Fig. 4).
In contrast, NBO failed to reduce the infarct volumes and tended
to worsen the neurological function in eNOS KO mice.
Effects of HFD alone on various outcome measures
We observed that HFD affected several outcome measures in
both WT and ApoE KO mice. The characteristic expansion of
perfusion defect over time was absent in cohorts on HFD (Fig.
2B), likely related to the suppression of PID occurrence in these
groups (Fig. 3C). As a result, HFD was associated with smaller
infarct volumes in WT mice (Fig. 3B).

Discussion
A large body of preclinical data suggests that NBO is neuroprotective in stroke via multiple converging mechanisms including
improved tissue oxygenation, perfusion and metabolism, inhibition of harmful peri-infarct spreading depolarizations, and preservation of blood– brain barrier and reduced brain edema
(Branston et al., 1976; Singhal et al., 2002a, 2007; S. Liu et al.,
2006; Henninger et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2007; W. Liu et al., 2008,
2009b, 2011; Yuan et al., 2010; Michalski et al., 2012). However,
pilot clinical trials to date have yielded disappointing results,
some even suggesting potential harm (Anderson et al., 1991;
Nighoghossian et al., 1995; Rusyniak et al., 2003; Singhal et al.,
2005; Chiu et al., 2006; Rincon et al., 2014; also see
http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00414726). Our data implicate vascular endothelium as a critical site of action for NBO, and
show that eNOS dysfunction is capable of abrogating the neuroprotective effects of NBO in focal cerebral ischemia. These data
provide a plausible explanation for the discordance between
strong neuroprotective efficacy in animal studies and lack of it in
pilot clinical trials conducted thus far. Stroke patients are often

infarct volume in the WT, but not in WT ⫹ HFD or ApoE KO ⫹ HFD groups. Indeed there was a
trend for larger infarct volumes after NBO in eNOS KO. Of note, HFD decreased infarct volumes
significantly in WT mice. C, The frequency of PIDs was also reduced by NBO in WT mice only, as
well as by HFD in WT and ApoE KO mice. D, Hyperoxia decreased the minimum critical CBF level
required to survive 60 min dMCAO, suggesting that enhanced cortical oxygenation was still
neuroprotective, but tissue outcome was offset by worsening perfusion in ApoE KO ⫹ HFD and
eNOS KO groups. Data are expressed as box-whisker plots in which median (horizontal line),

elderly with multiple vascular risk factors associated with endothelial dysfunction. Therefore, NBO may be ineffective, and even
harmful in those patients with severe endothelial dysfunction.
Unfortunately, small sample sizes in previous trials preclude subgroup analyses to test this. Conversely, one can speculate that
NBO may achieve its full neuroprotective potential in young patients, particularly in pediatric stroke. The possibility is worth
exploring clinically.
Several studies thus far have shown that NBO can indeed augment or preserve tissue perfusion (Singhal et al., 2002a, 2005; S.
Liu et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2012). The mechanism
of improved ischemic tissue perfusion by NBO is unknown, but
may include enhanced NO production by eNOS through O2 substrate availability, and suppression of PIDs and their vasoconstrictive effects on penumbral circulation (Shin et al., 2007).
These mechanisms, however, could not explain the worsening of

J. Neurosci., November 12, 2014 • 34(46):15200 –15207 • 15205

tissue perfusion in eNOS KO, and to a lesser extent in ApoE KO,
during NBO, as neither tissue oxygenation (Fig. 2C) nor the frequency of PIDs (Fig. 3C) was adversely affected by NBO in the
mutants. It is possible that eNOS dysfunction (e.g., cofactor deficiency) may lead to enhanced free radical production by eNOS
(Dumitrescu et al., 2007) during NBO in the ApoE KO. However,
such a mechanism cannot explain the findings in eNOS KO
where eNOS is not expressed.
As an alternative mechanism to explain improved perfusion
in the WT, NBO can cause mild vasoconstriction in normal brain
potentially redirecting blood from nonischemic cortex where it is
not needed to the ischemic brain (i.e., reverse steal or Robin
Hood effect). However, NBO did not change CBF in nonischemic
brain in the WT, and indeed rapidly worsened it in the eNOS KO
(Fig. 2D), arguing against reverse steal as a relevant mechanism in
this model.
Of note, in contrast to the perceived role of eNOS in the
pathophysiology of stroke (Endres et al., 2004), we did not find
larger infarcts after dMCAO or worse neurological outcomes after fMCAO in eNOS KO mice compared with WT in this study.
Indeed, a review of literature shows that infarct volumes in eNOS
KO range from ⬃20% smaller to ⬃20% larger compared with
WT controls after fMCAO (Z. Huang et al., 1996; Kilic et al.,
2005; Rikitake et al., 2005; Hiroi et al., 2006). Our data also show
that both ApoE KO on HFD and eNOS KO have higher BPs.
eNOS KO is known to be hypertensive (P. L. Huang et al., 1995;
Wood et al., 2013), and we and others have recently reported
higher BPs in the ApoE KO mice on HFD (Ayata et al., 2013;
Cleverley et al., 2013; Pelham et al., 2013; Alfaidi et al., 2014; Mai
et al., 2014). Hypertension was observed in other hyperlipidemic
animal models as well (McCalden et al., 1987), although not all
studies agree (Kitayama et al., 2007). Mechanisms are unknown,
but may involve eNOS dysfunction (Rossitch et al., 1991; d’Uscio
et al., 2001a, b; Kitayama et al., 2007), possibly via reciprocal
changes in eNOS phosphorylation at the positive and negative
regulatory sites (i.e., reduced S1176 and increased T494 phosphorylation, respectively; Ayata et al., 2013).
Last, our data suggest that HFD exerts a protective effect in
acute focal cerebral ischemia and implicates suppression of PIDs
as a mechanism. We have previously reported a similar effect
where 8 weeks of HFD yielded smaller infarcts and lower viability
thresholds compared with 4 weeks of HFD in WT mice (Ayata et
al., 2013). This may be related to the ketogenic properties of HFD,
exerting direct anti-excitatory and neuroprotective effects (Puchowicz et al., 2008). The direct cerebrovascular effects of HFD in
nonhyperlipidemic models have been variable in literature. For
example, 8 weeks of HFD in WT rats enlarged infarcts after
fMCAO and markedly increased hemorrhagic transformation
despite the absence of hyperlipidemia (Li et al., 2013). Enlarged
infarcts were also reported in another study after 10 weeks of
HFD in rats (Deutsch et al., 2009). However, in aged mice HFD
tended to reduce infarcts after dMCAO compared with regular
diet (Dhungana et al., 2013), and 1 month HFD did not increase
infarct volumes in a rat endothelin injection model of focal ischemia (Langdon et al., 2011). While apparently contradictory, differences in species and experimental model may explain these
discrepancies. For example, dMCAO and ET-1 injection models
yield relatively small cortical infarcts and rarely any hemorrhagic
transformation; the latter may have contributed to the larger infarct sizes after fMCAO in rats on HFD. In addition, rats develop
fewer PIDs than mice, and therefore, the protective effect of HFD
may be milder in rats. Altogether, data suggest that the direct

15206 • J. Neurosci., November 12, 2014 • 34(46):15200 –15207

effects of HFD on stroke outcome may be species and model
dependent.
In summary, considering (1) the ease with which NBO can be
implemented rapidly in the field, (2) uniform proof of efficacy in
animal models including clinically relevant endpoints such as
MRI (Singhal et al., 2002b, Singhal et al., 2007; S. Liu et al., 2006;
Henninger et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2007; W. Liu et al., 2008), and
(3) safety data dispelling concerns related to hemorrhage or free
radical production (Singhal et al., 2002b; Kim et al., 2005; S. Liu et
al., 2006; W. Liu et al., 2008, 2009a; Sun et al., 2010), a better
understanding of the mechanisms of failure in clinical trials is
needed. Refocusing on physiological therapies is particularly important given the difficulties associated with translating pharmacological therapies in stroke.
