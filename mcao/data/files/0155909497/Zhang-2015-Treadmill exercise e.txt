Abstract 
Background:  The transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) has proved to ameliorate ischemic brain
injury in animals, but most transplanted MSCs undergo apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra, greatly compromising
the therapeutic value of this treatment. Meanwhile, cell apoptosis can be inhibited by post-ischemia exercise which
has been demonstrated to improve the expression of related anti-apoptotic proteins. The present study investigated
whether treadmill exercise enhances the neuroprotective effects of transplanted MSCs in a rat experimental stroke
model.
Result:  Rats were subjected to 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Twenty-four hours after reperfusion,
they were assigned randomly to receive no MSCs treatment and no exercise (control group), intravenous transplan‑
tation of MSCs and treadmill exercise (MSCs + Ex group), MSCs transplantation only (MSCs group) and treadmill
exercise only (Ex group). Neurological assessment, TUNEL staining and western blot were performed. Compared with
the MSCs group and Ex group, the MSCs + Ex group reported markedly improved neurological function, significantly
decreased apoptotic cells, and increased expressions of survivin and bcl-2 (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, respectively). Inter‑
estingly, the treadmill exercise significantly inhibited the apoptosis of transplanted MSCs. As a result, the number of
engrafted MSCs in the MSCs + Ex group was significantly higher than that in the MSC group (p < 0.01).
Conclusions:  Treadmill exercise enhances the therapeutic potency of MSCs by improving neurological function
and possibly inhibiting the apoptosis of neuron cells and transplanted MSCs. These effects may involve an increased
expression of survivin and bcl-2.

Background
Stroke has been emerging as one of the most common
causes of mortality and morbidity in modern society.
Most stroke survivors live with residual impairments
that diminish independence and quality of life [1]. Of
its potential therapeutic candidates, bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) transplantation has been previously
demonstrated to ameliorate ischemic brain injury [2–8].

Although the exact mechanism is still unknown, it is suggested that the effect of MSCs transplantation depends
on the number of transplanted MSCs [9]. However, the
viability of MSCs is relatively poor when transplanted
into the ischemic tissue [10]. On the other hand, much
evidence suggests that exercise is beneficial for the
recovery of brain function in animals and humans, and
has been recommended as a therapeutic strategy for
stroke. The beneficial effects of exercise therapy include
moderation of neuronal damage, reduction of infarct
volume, promotion of brain neurogenesis and angiogenesis, enhancement of brain metabolic capacity and brain

plasticity [11–14]. Of particular importance, exercise
can inhibit cell apoptosis by improving the expression of
related anti-apoptotic proteins in the cerebral ischemic
area [15]. Considering the anti-apoptotic effects of exercise, it may have synergetic neuroprotective effects with
MSCs transplantation in the stroke treatment. Thus, the
purpose of this study was to investigate whether treadmill exercise can enhance the neuroprotective effects of
transplanted MSCs in a rat experimental stroke model
by comparing the combined therapy of treadmill exercise
and MSCs transplantation with either exercise or MSCs
transplantation only.

Methods
Animal ethics

All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Fujian Medical University and were conducted in accordance with
the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23,
revised in 1996). The investigators responsible for molecular, histological and functional studies were blinded to
the treatment groups.
Isolation, expansion and identification of MSCs

MSCs were isolated from rat bone marrow and expanded
in  vivo according to the method of Friedenstein et  al.
[16]. In brief, we euthanized Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats
(weighted 80–100 g) to obtain the bone marrow. The harvested bone marrow cells were introduced into 100-mm
dishes and cultured in a complete medium which consists of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM,
Sigma, USA) containing 10  % fetal bovine serum and
antibiotics: 100  U/ml penicillin G, 100  mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 mg amphotericin B. The culture medium
was replaced every 3  days and floating cells were discarded. The attached cells were divided into three new
flasks after two passages and cultured until the cell density of the colonies grew to an approximately 90 % confluence. The cellular characteristics were identified by flow
cytometric analysis. After blocked for nonspecific binding with buffer containing 1 % bovine serum albumin, the
cells were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min with the following
antibodies: anti-CD29, Phycoerythrin (PE), anti-CD106,
PE, (Biolegend, USA), anti-CD44, luorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-CD14, FITC and anti-CD45, FITC
(AbD Serotec, USA). The matched isotype controls were
purchased from AbD Serotec and Biolegend. At least
1 × 104 cells per sample were acquired and analyzed.

previously described [17, 18]. Briefly, for adipocyte differentiation, MSCs were cultured for 3  weeks with adipogenic medium, containing 10−6 M dexamethasone,
10  μg/ml insulin and 100  μg/ml 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine (Sigma, USA); for osteoblast differentiation, MSCs
was cultured for 3 weeks with osteogenic medium, containing 10−7M dexamethasone, 50  μg/ml ascorbic acid
and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate (Sigma, USA). Oil-red-O
and von kossa dyes were respectively employed to identify adipocytes and osteoblasts.
Animal model

Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (weighed 220–250  g)
were used in this study. A middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established with the modified Longa
method [19]. Rats were initially anesthetized with isoflurane (containing 3  % induction, 1.5  % maintenance in
30 % O2 and 70 % N2O). The right common carotid artery,
external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery
were exposed. A 3.0 monofilament nylon suture (18.5 mm,
determined by animal weight), with its tip rounded by heating it near a flame, was advanced from the ECA into the
lumen of the internal carotid artery until it blocked the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Two hours after
MCAO, animals were reanesthetized with isoflurane, and
reperfusion was performed by withdrawal the suture until
the tip cleared the lumen of the ECA. The rectal temperature was controlled at 37  °C with a feedback-regulated
water heating system during the surgical procedure. Immediately after the procedure, rats were randomly divided into
4 groups: (1) control group, receiving no MSCs treatment
and no exercise (n = 12), (2) Ex group, receiving exercise
treatment only (n = 12), (3) MSCs group, receiving MSCs
treatment only (n = 18), (4) MSCs  + Ex group, receiving
MSCs treatment and exercise (n = 18).
Cell labeling and transplantation

MSCs were labeled with the lipophilic fluorochrome
chloromethylbenzamido dialkylcarbocyanine (CM-DiI,
Molecular Probes, USA) which was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide that had been incubated at 37 °C for 5 min
and at 4 °C for 15 min (with a density of 1 ug CM-DiI per
million cells) and then washed twice. After 2-h middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 24-h reperfusion,
rats in the MSCs and MSCs  +  Ex group were injected
with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing
3 × 106 MSCs labeled with CM-DiI via the tail vein. Rats
in the control group were injected with a comparable volume of PBS.

Differentiation assay of MSCs

Treadmill exercise training

The differentiation of MSCs in  vitro towards the adipogenic and the osteogenic lineages were assayed as

A motor-driven treadmill (Treadmill Simplex II, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) was used in

Zhang et al. BMC Neurosci (2015) 16:56

the study, which forces the rats to run via an electric
stimulation system installed on the rear floor. Prior to
the surgery, all rats underwent a 3-day treadmill exercise adaptation. Only the rats that learned to run were
included in the study. A gradual treadmill exercise schedule was applied in which all qualified rats ran at 4 m/min
for the first day, 8  m/min for the second day, and then
12  m/min for the remaining days with an inclination of
0°. The rats in the Ex group and MSCs + Ex group underwent the treadmill exercise 2 days after the surgery at an
intensity of 30  min per day for a maximum of 14  days.
The rats in the control and MSCs groups were allowed
to move freely in their cages, but no additional treadmill
exercise was employed.
Behavioral testing

All rats underwent behavioral testing at day 1 and 14 after
MCAO using a modified neurological severity score, as
described previously [9]. In brief, this score was a composition of the motor (response to raising the rat by the tail or
placing the rat on a flat surface), sense (response to visual,
tactile, and proprioceptive stimulation), balance (response
to placement and posture on a narrow beam and time
before dropping), and reflex (response of pinna, cornea and
startle) tests. This compositive neurological function test
was graded on a scale of 0–18 (normal score, 0; maximal
deficit score, 18), where one point was awarded for the inability to perform a task or for a lack of a tested reflex.
Assessment of apoptosis in ischemic penumbra

The anti-apoptotic effects of each treatment were examined at 14 days after MCAO (n = 6 in each group). Paraffin embedded sections were prepared for TUNEL assay.
TUNEL staining was performed with a commercially
available kit (ApopTag Plus; Serological Corporation,
USA). The number of TUNEL-positive cells per field in
the ischemic penumbra was counted and expressed as
the average in the 6 fields. To evaluate apoptosis of transplanted MSCs in the ischemic penumbra, 12 additional
rats were used (MSCs group, n = 6; MSCs + Ex group,
n = 6). At 14 days after MCAO, rats were transcardially
perfused with heparinized saline, followed by 4  % paraformaldehyde, and then 8  μm-thick coronal frozen sections were cut on a cryostat frozen sections. TUNEL
staining was performed with a commercially available kit
(ApopTag Fluorescein kit, USA). The number of TUNELand CM-DiI-positive cells was counted and expressed as
the average in the 6 sections.
Western Blot for survivin and bcl‑2 expression in ischemic
penumbra

Rats were euthanized with isoflurane 14  days after
MCAO (n = 6 in each group). The protein concentration

Page 3 of 8

from the ischemic penumbra was determined using the
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kits (Beyotime
Biotechnology, P. R. China). Thirty micrograms denatured protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and loaded
on 10  % acrylamide gel for electrophoresis and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF,
Invitrogen, USA). The membranes were incubated with
rabbit anti-survivin (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and rabbit anti-Bcl-2 (1:500,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
respectively. Horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated goatanti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Bio-Rad
Laboratories) was used as the secondary antibody and
GADPH was used as a loading control. All bands from
western blot were analyzed using Image J software (version 1.6 NIH) to verify the relative level of survivin and
bcl-2 defined as the optical density ration of survivin or
bcl-2 over GADPH.
Statistical analysis

Data were presented as mean values and standard deviation. Student’s t test was used for two-group comparisons
and one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) with Scheffe’s post hoc test was used to identify differences among
all groups. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered as
statistically significant.

Results
Characterization, differentiation and labeling of the
cultured MSCs

At day 3 after planting, the culture cells were observed
to scatter in a manner of colonial distributions. Then, at
days 8–9, the dish was covered with long-spindle cells.
The passage cells were uniformly distributed and displayed the typical “broblast-like” morphology (Fig.  1a).
Flow cytometric analysis showed that the 3rd passage
MSCs highly expressed the surface marker molecules
CD29 (97.0  %), CD90 (95.2  %) and lowly expressed the
blood cell surface molecules CD14 (1.2  %) and CD45
(2.7 %) (Fig. 1d–h). After 3 weeks of adipogenic induction
and oesteogenic induction, the cells displayed lipid-laden
adipocyte phenotype by Oil red ‘O’ dyes and calciumdeposited osteoblast phenotype by von kossa staining,
respectively (Fig. 1b, c). Flow cytometric analysis showed
more than 95  % MSCs were successfully labeled by
CM-DiI.
Behavioral testing

There was no significant difference in neurological severity scores among the 4 groups at day 1 after MCAO. At
day 14, scores of the MSCs group and Ex group were
lower than those of the control group (7.33  ±  0.82 vs
8.83 ± 0.75, p < 0.05; 7.50 ± 1.37 vs 8.83 ± 0.75, p < 0.05,

was lower than that in the control group (25.00  ±  3.74

p  <  0.05, respectively) and that no significant difference
was found between the MSCs and Ex groups. Of note,
the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the MSCs  +  Ex
group was significantly lower than that of the MSCs
and Ex groups (12.17  ±  1.72 vs 25.00  ±  3.74, p  <  0.01;
12.17  ±  1.72 vs 27.00  ±  2.00, p  <  0.01, respectively)
(Fig. 3b, c).
MSCs transplantation combined with exercise induces a
greater expression of survivin and bcl‑2

To determine whether survivin and bcl-2 are involved
in the anti-apoptotic effects, we examined the level of
protein expression in the ischemic penumbra by western blot 14  days after MCAO (Fig.  4). The result demonstrated that compared with the control group, the
level of survivin was higher in the MSCs (0.57  ±  0.08
vs 0.33  ±  0.04, p  <  0.01) and Ex group (0.64  ±  0.10 vs
0.33  ±  0.04, p  <  0.01) and that there was no significant difference between the MSCs and Ex groups. The
level of survivin expression in the MSCs  +  Ex group
was significantly higher than that of the MSCs and Ex
groups (1.12 ± 0.11 vs 0.57 ± 0.08, p < 0.01; 1.12 ± 0.11
vs 0.64  ±  0.10, p  <  0.01, respectively). Similarly, the
level of bcl-2 expression was higher in the MSCs group
(0.47  ±  0.07 vs 0.19  ±  0.04, p  <  0.01) and Ex group
(0.49  ±  0.08 vs 0.19  ±  0.04, p  <  0.01) when compared
with that of the control group; there was no significant
difference between the MSCs and Ex groups. The level
of bcl-2 expression in the MSCs  +  Ex group was significantly higher than that of the MSCs and Ex groups

Exercise inhibits the apoptosis of transplanted MSCs

The CM-DiI-labeled MSCs were detected in the ischemic
penumbra after transplantation (Fig.  5a). Quantitative
analysis indicated that 14 days after MCAO, the number
of engrafted MSCs in the MSCs + Ex group was sharply
higher than that in the MSCs group (40.17  ±  5.46 vs
23.67  ±  3.88, p  <  0.01) (Fig.  5b). The ratio of TUNELpositive MSCs in the MSCs  +  Ex group was markedly lower than that in the MSCs group (19.84  ±  2.7  %
vs 30.32  ±  6.90  %, p  <  0.01) (Fig.  5c). Meanwhile, the

number of TUNEL-positive non MSCs, including neuronal cells, was also decreased by treadmill exercise.
Quantitative analysis indicated that the number of
TUNEL-positive non MSCs in the MSCs + Ex group was
sharply lower than that in the MSCs group (18.0 ± 1.41
vs 4.5 ± 1.52, p < 0.01) (Fig. 5d).

Discussion
In the present study, we showed that: (1) Treadmill exercise and MSCs transplantation inhibited the apoptosis
in the ischemic penumbra; (2) Only a few transplanted
MSCs were detected in the ischemic penumbra of the
MSCs group, while the combination of treadmill exercise

and MSCs transplantation increased the number of
engrafted MSCs; (3) The combination of treadmill exercise and MSCs transplantation up-regulated the expression of survivin and bcl-2, enhancing the anti-apoptosis
effects on neuron cells in the ischemic penumbra, and
finally greatly improved the recovery of neurological function when compared with treadmill exercise or
MSCs transplantation only.
Previous studies have suggested that pre- or postischemic exercise reduces brain injury and improves
neurological deficits in a rat stroke model [14, 20]. The
present study demonstrated that early post-ischemic
treadmill exercise improved neurological functions in
rats. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain
unclear. It is well known that an ischemic insult to the

brain can result in neural loss due to either necrosis or
apoptosis or both. Unlike most cells in the ischemic core,
which undergo irreversibly necrosis, many cells in the
ischemic penumbra will undergo apoptosis. Thus the
cells in the ischemic penumbra are potentially recoverable and there is an opportunity for salvage. Expectedly, in the present study, treadmill exercise decreased
TUNEL-positive cells in the ischemic penumbra 14 days
after stroke. These results suggest that treadmill exercise
improves neurological functions, at least in part, through
the inhibition of cell apoptosis in the ischemic penumbra.
Recently, MSCs transplantation has been shown to
play beneficial roles in repairing the damaged brain tissue and improving functional outcome in experimental rodent models of focal ischemia. In this study, our

Zhang et al. BMC Neurosci (2015) 16:56

results confirmed that transplantation of MSCs 24  h
after ischemia induced significant improvement of functional deficit in adult rats. This finding is consistent with
those of other studies showing functional improvement
induced by intravenously transplanted MSCs [9]. Furthermore, we examined the apoptotic cells in the brain
using TUNEL staining. Our results showed that the
TUNEL-positive cells in the ischemic penumbra were
down-regulated after MSCs transplantation, which suggests that the neuroprotective effect of MSCs is related
not only to their role in neurogenesis, angiogenesis, alleviating inflammatory cascade reaction and formatting of
structural reorganization, as previously reported [3, 4, 6,
21], but also to their potential anti-apoptotic effect.
The molecular mechanisms of apoptosis have been
thoroughly studied and are currently well-understood.
Survivin and bcl-2, the family of proto-oncogenes, have
been documented to regulate apoptosis. Survivin is
expressed in a cell cycle-regulated manner and localized together with caspase 3 and 7 on microtubules
within centrosomes to suppress apoptosis in the G2/M
phases [22]. Unlike survivin, bcl-2 suppresses apoptosis
by regulating the release of cytochrome c [23], which
is often considered as a point of no return in the subsequent caspase cascade. It has been suggested that the
over-expression of survivin or bcl-2 protects neurons
against cerebral ischemia [23–25]. In addition, several
studies have shown that exercise or MSCs transplantation inhibits the apoptosis of neurons through inducing
the expression of survivin or bcl-2 or both in a model
of stroke [15, 26]. In present study, we used a method
of western blot to detect the level of survivin and bcl-2
expression. We found that either treadmill exercise or
MSCs transplantation after cerebral ischemia promoted
survivin and bcl-2 expression in the ischemic penumbra
at day 14, suggesting that these proteins suppress apoptosis in the ischemic lesion. Interestingly, MSCs transplantation plus exercise induced a greater expression of
surivin and bcl-2 than exercise or MSCs transplantation
only. The result is consistent with the finding that MSCs
transplantation plus exercise greatly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the ischemic penumbra,
suggesting that a combination of exercise with MSCs
transplantation has synergetic inhibitive effects on neuronal apoptosis.
CM-DiI dye is a carbocyanine membrane probe with
strong photo-stable fluorescence, long cellular retention, and minimal cytotoxicity [27]. Moreover, DiI is
retained in cells throughout fixation, permeabilization, and paraffin-embedding procedures [28]. Previous studies have demonstrated that CM-DiI is useful
for long-term MSCs labeling [29, 30]. In the present
study, we pre-labeled MSCs with CM-DiI dye. Only a

Page 7 of 8

few transplanted MSCs were detected in the ischemic
penumbra of the MSCs group. However, a lot more
CM-DiI labeled MSCs were detected in the MSCs + Ex
group, suggesting that exercise contributes to prolonging
the viability of transplanted MSCs. Meanwhile, the ratio
of TUNEL-positive MSCs in the MSCs + Ex group was
sharply lower than that in the MSCs group. These results
suggest that treadmill exercise contributes to inhibiting
the apoptosis of transplanted MSCs and finally prolonging the survival time of transplanted MSCs. Moreover,
the number of apoptotic non-MSCs in the MSCs  +  Ex
group was sharply lower than that in the MSCs group,
suggesting direct protective effects of treadmill exercise
on the ischemic penumbra. Finally, we observed that a
combination of treadmill exercise and MSCs transplantation markedly improved neurological functions compared with MSCs transplantation only. Considering the
anti-apoptotic effects of treadmill exercise and MSCs
transplantation, treadmill exercise may have potential
synergetic neuroprotective effects and enhance the therapeutic potency of MSCs transplantation, leading to further improvement in neurological functions after stroke.

Conclusions
Treadmill exercise enhances the therapeutic potency of
MSCs by improving neurological function and possibly
through inhibition of cells apoptosis, including neuron
cells and transplanted MSCs themselves. These effects
may involve a greater expression of survivin and bcl-2. A
combination of treadmill exercise and MSCs transplantation may be a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment
of cerebral ischemia.
