Abstract
Background: The acute phase protein pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a new biomarker of stroke severity and is a key
regulator of oedema resolution and glial responses after cerebral ischaemia, emerging as a possible target for brain
repair after stroke. Neurogenesis and angiogenesis are essential events in post-stroke recovery. Here, we investigated
for the first time the role of PTX3 in neurogenesis and angiogenesis after stroke.
Methods: PTX3 knockout (KO) or wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to experimental cerebral ischaemia (induced by
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)). Poststroke neurogenesis was assessed by nestin, doublecortin (DCX) and
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunostaining, whereas angiogenesis was assessed by BrdU, vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and PECAM-1 immunostaining. In vitro neurogenesis and angiogenesis assays were carried
out on neurospheres derived from WT or interleukin-1β (IL-1β) KO mice, and mouse endothelial cell line bEnd.5
respectively. Behavioural function was assessed in WT and PTX3 KO mice using open-field, motor and Y-maze tests.
Results: Neurogenesis was significantly reduced in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus of PTX3 KO mice,
compared to WT mice, 6 days after MCAo. In addition, recombinant PTX3 was neurogenic in vitro when added to
neurospheres, which was mediated by IL-1β. In vivo poststroke angiogenesis was significantly reduced in PTX3 KO mice
compared to WT mice 14 days after MCAo, as revealed by reduced vascular density, less newly formed blood vessels
and decreased expression of VEGFR2. In vitro, recombinant PTX3 induced marked endothelial cellular proliferation and
promoted formation of tube-like structures of endothelial cell line bEnd.5. Finally, a lack of PTX3 potentiated motor
deficits 14 days after MCAo.
Conclusions: These results indicate that PTX3 mediates neurogenesis and angiogenesis and contributes to functional
recovery after stroke, highlighting a key role of PTX3 as a mediator of brain repair and suggesting that PTX3 could be
used as a new target for stroke therapy.

Background
The acute phase protein pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is an
important regulator of peripheral innate immunity
and is now recognised as key mediator of inflammation
during cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [1,2].
Increased PTX3 levels are associated with the incidence of
cardiovascular disease [3-5], and PTX3 is recognised as an
independent predictor of mortality at 3 months after acute
myocardial infarction [6]. Importantly, the involvement of

PTX3 in cerebrovascular disease such as ischaemic stroke
is emerging; peripheral PTX3 levels are strongly increased
after experimental stroke in mice [1] whilst plasma PTX3
levels correlate with mortality after ischaemic stroke in
human [7]. Importantly, our recent study found that
PTX3 is highly expressed in the brain after experimental
cerebral ischaemia and that its central expression is critically regulated by the cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1), a pivotal
regulator of inflammation after stroke. Whilst we found that
PTX3 has no direct role in stroke pathogenesis, we found
that PTX3 is a key regulator of early repair processes after
stroke, including blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity,
resolution of oedema and glial scar formation [1].

Inflammation is critically implicated in the pathogenesis
of stroke and is regulated by IL-1 [8,9], whilst blocking
IL-1-induced inflammation is neuroprotective in experimental and clinical settings [10,11]. Although acute
IL-1-driven inflammation is detrimental to the brain
and contributes to poor outcome, the delayed inflammatory
response, although not well-documented, may initiate and
sustain key brain repair mechanisms including neurogenesis and angiogenesis. For example, inhibition of
matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (a key enzyme whose expression
is driven by IL-1 [12]), impairs angiogenesis and functional
recovery 7 to 14 days after stroke [13]. Angiogenesis takes
place primarily in the penumbra surrounding the ischaemic
core, correlates with survival after stroke [14] and is tightly
linked with neurogenesis, since neural progenitor cells
differentiate and migrate along angiogenic niches [15].
Although we have reported that IL-1-driven PTX3 expression in the brain is important for the early repair mechanisms associated with the vasculature, the role of PTX3 in
delayed repair mechanisms, including neurogenesis and
angiogenesis, has never been explored. The aim of this study
was to characterize the role of PTX3 in post-stroke neurogenesis, angiogenesis and functional recovery.

Methods
Animals

PTX3 knockout (KO) mice, kindly provided by Dr. Cecilia
Garlanda (Humanitas Clinical and Research Center,
Rozzano, Italy), were bred as heterozygous, and litter
genotyping was performed as described previously [16].
Age- and weight-matched wild-type (WT) and PTX3 KO
male littermates were used for all experiments. IL-1β KO
mice were provided by Prof. Yoichiro Iwakura (University
of Tokyo, Japan). All mice were bred on a C57BL/6
background. Animals were kept at 21°C ± 1°C, 55% ± 10%
humidity, in a 12 h light-dark cycle, and had free access to
food and water. All animal procedures were carried out in
accordance with the European Council directives (86/609/
EEC) the Animal Scientific Procedures Act (UK) 1986 and
the ARRIVE guidelines, and were approved by the Home
Office (UK) (Project licence 40/3617).
Cerebral ischemia induced by transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion and BrdU administration

Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) was
performed using the intraluminal filament method as
described previously [17]. Briefly, a filament was introduced
through the left external carotid artery and advanced along
the internal carotid artery to occlude the middle cerebral
artery (MCA). A drop in blood flow in the MCA territory
was confirmed by laser Doppler monitoring (Moor
Instruments, Axminster, UK). No difference in blood
flow was observed between WT and PTX3 KO prior to,
during and after occlusion [1]. After 30 min of occlusion,

the filament was removed and mice recovered for 48 h,
6 days or 14 days. Mice were injected subcutaneously with
0.5 ml of sterile saline daily for rehydration, and were
continuously monitored for neurologic symptoms. To
assess cell proliferation, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma,
Poole, UK) dissolved in sterile phosphate buffer saline
(PBS) was injected intraperitoneally twice daily (50 mg/kg)
in mice that recovered for 6 days in order to monitor the
initiation of vascular proliferation as well as early neurogenesis. For mice recovering for 14 days, BrdU was
injected from days 4 to 8 (once a day on days 4 and 8, and
twice a day on days 5 to 7). This allowed us to study a
later time window of proliferation still close to the peak of
angiogenesis. BrdU injection during the first 3 days was
avoided in this group to minimise BrdU signal from early
glial proliferation, which is dominant at this time point.
Tissue collection, measurement of infarct size and
immunohistochemistry

Brains were collected and immunostained as described
previously [1]. Briefly, mice were perfused transcardially
with 0.9% saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA). Brains were removed, fixed in 20% sucrose/PFA
and sectioned (20- to 25-μm thickness) using a sledge
microtome (Bright, Huntington, UK). Infarct size was
determined as previously reported [18]. In brief, eight
coronal sections per brain were stained with cresyl violet
(Sigma, Poole, UK). Infarct area was measured on each
section and corrected to account for oedema. Areas
were then integrated to obtain infarct volume. For BrdU
immunostaining, sections were pretreated with 1 M HCl
for 2 min on ice, and then for 30 min at 37°C. For NeuN,
doublecortin (DCX) and nestin immunohistochemistry,
sections were pretreated for 30 min with 10 mM sodium
citrate at 50°C. Nonspecific staining was blocked with 2%
normal donkey serum (Jackson Laboratories, Baltimore,
USA) in primary diluent (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for
1 h. Overnight incubation in primary antibodies was
followed by three washes and 2 h incubation in secondary
fluorescent antibodies. Primary antibodies used were
sheep anti-BrdU (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rat
anti-BrdU (1:500, AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK), rat
anti-PECAM-1 (1:200, BD Pharmingen, Oxford, UK),
rabbit anti-VEGFR2 (1:300, Cell Signalling, Hitchin, UK),
mouse anti-NeuN (1:500, Millipore, Watford, UK), mouse
anti-nestin (1:500, Millipore, Watford, UK) and goat
anti-DCX (1:750, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Dallas,
Texas, USA). Secondary antibodies were conjugated
to Alexa 488 or 594 fluorochromes (Invitrogen, Paisley,
UK). Sections were cover-slipped with Prolong Gold
antifade with or without DAPI (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). An
Olympus BX51 upright microscope coupled to a Coolsnap
ES camera (Photometrics, Herts UK) and MetaVue
Software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California, USA)

were used to capture the images. Two coronal sections
per animal were analysed with three randomly selected
images within each area of interest (striatum, SVZ or
hippocampus, depending on the marker assessed). Coronal sections from Bregma levels 1.18 to 0 (according to
the MBL mouse brain atlas, www.mbl.org) were used to
quantify markers in the striatum and the SVZ, and sections from Bregma levels −1.46 to −2.54 were used to
quantify markers in the hippocampus.
Image analysis

Counts of BrdU positive nuclei, BrdU-PECAM-1 positive
vessels and nestin positive profiles were done manually.
Areas and mean optical density (OD) were measured
using Image J (National Institutes of Health, USA,
http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The percentage of the total
area of the image stained with PECAM-1 or VEGF was
quantified. Percentage of area stained was measured
manually after thresholding the images with Image J.
PECAM-1-BrdU and VEGF measurements are presented
as raw data and also normalised to the amount of
PECAM-1 (for example, (%VEGF staining/%PECAM-1
staining) x 100). In all cases, the average of the values
obtained from the six images (three images in each of
the two sections used) was calculated.
Behavioural tests

Mice recovering for 14 days were tested for behavioural
deficits. Basic motor deficits were measured with a
points system adapted from a previous study [19] as
follows: 1 point for torso flexion to the right in the air; 2
points for deficit in gripping with a paw; 3 points for
circling with the front paws when suspended from the
tail; 4 points for spontaneous circling on the floor; 5
points for irresponsiveness to stimuli. The sum of all
points was used as the score of motor deficit. General
motivation to explore and motor function were measured
in an open field: mouse movement within a square chamber was tracked for 5 min and analysed by overlapping the
recording to a 16-squares grid with 2020 PLUS tracking
software (HVS Image, Thornborough, UK). Time mobile,
number of line crossings, number of rearings and rotational
bias (asymmetric rotation that occurs as a consequence of
unilateral MCAo) were measured. Short-term memory was
measured in a Y-maze as described previously [20].
Briefly, mouse entries in each arm of a Y-shaped
chamber containing a different visual stimulus at the end
of each arm were measured during 8 min. The percentage
of alternations (that is ABC, CBA, BAC, etcetera) was
calculated. Y-maze test was performed on the evening of
day 13 after MCAo, and assessment of motor scores and
open field test were performed on the morning of day 14
after MCAo, when mice were euthanized.

Neural stem progenitor cell cultures and measurement of
neurogenesis in vitro

Neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) cultures were
prepared from the cerebral cortex of WT or IL-1β
KO mice (embryonic stage 16 days of gestation) as
previously described [21]. Cells were then cultured as
free-floating neurospheres in 75 cm2 flasks (Nunc,
Roskilde, Denmark) at a density of 20,000 cells/ml
[22] in DMEM/F12 supplemented with B27, 3 μg/ml
heparin, 20 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and
20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) (PeproTech,
London, UK). Primary neurospheres were grown for 7
to 10 days before secondary cultures were established
with mechanically dissociated cells. Neurospheres were
passaged every 5 to 7 days, and experiments were
performed after three to seven passages.
NSPC proliferation was assessed using a well-accepted
measure of neurosphere proliferation [23,24]. NSPCs were
progressively diluted from 4,000 to 125 cells in 96-well
plates. Dissociated cells were exposed for 7 days to a single
optimal concentration of PTX3 (100 ng/ml; R&D Systems,
Abingdon, UK), after which the number of neurospheres
formed was counted. The number of new neurospheres
was plotted against the initial number of cells plated, from
which the fate of the neural stem cells was evaluated
[25,26]. As an additional measure of the effect of PTX3
on in vitro neurogenesis, BrdU incorporation into
neurospheres was quantified. After 6 days in culture,
cells were treated with PTX3 (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. BrdU
(10 μM) was added in the last 18 h. Neurospheres were
then dissociated, plated onto poly-L-ornithine coated
(15 μg/ml) 24-well plates for 1 h, fixed for 20 min in 4%
PFA and immunostained. For BrdU immunostaining,
cells were treated with 2 M HCl for 10 min, which
was neutralized with 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 9.5.
BrdU was visualized with a BrdU monoclonal antibody
(clone MoBU-1) Alexa Fluor conjugate 594 (Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK). BrdU incorporation was defined by the cells
labelled by Hoechst 33342 (10 μM) and with the BrdU
antibody. For in vitro neurogenesis assays, images were
acquired using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus
BX51), and neurospheres were counted using the image
analysis software ViewFinder 3.0.1 (Pixera Corporation,
Santa Clara, California, USA). Six microscope fields were
counted in each well at a 10× magnification, and two to
four wells were used per treatment in each experiment.
Measurement of angiogenesis in vitro

To assess the effect of PTX3 on angiogenesis in vitro, a
mouse endothelial cell line bEnd.5, which closely resembles
primary brain endothelium in culture, was used as
previously reported [27]. Since we used a model of
transient ischaemia in which blood flow is restored
after the surgery, we decided to carry out our in vitro

Rodriguez-Grande et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:15

experiments in normal conditions of oxygen and glucose
such as those present in the brain at the time when
angiogenesis and neurogenesis occur in vivo. Cells
were grown in DMEM (high glucose, 4.5 g/l; Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK), supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% nonessential amino acid, 2 mM glutamine, 1 U/ml penicillin, and
100 mg/ml streptomycin. To assess the proliferative effect
of PTX3, cells were seeded at 50,000 cells/cm2 and
were subsequently treated with recombinant PTX3 at
a concentration of 100 or 1,000 ng/ml. After 48 h,
cellular proliferation was observed under bright field
microscope, and cells were counted on five random
fields taken from three separate cultures.
Statistical analysis

Data normality was tested using Shapiro-Wilk test, and
normally distributed data were analysed as follows. An
unpaired Student’s t-test was used to compare two groups.
For the comparison of more than two groups, a one-way
or two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc
test was used. For the comparison of means to a given
value, one sample t-test was used. For motor scores,
which were not normally distributed, the non-parametric
Mann-Whitney test was used. All graphs show mean ± SEM,
except for motor deficit scores, in which medians and
interquartile ranges have been used. Statistical significance
was set at P <0.05. All analyses were made using
GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., USA).

Results
PTX3 regulates neurogenesis after middle cerebral artery
occlusion

Our previous study found no significant difference in
infarct size between PTX3 KO and WT mice 48 h or
6 days [1] after MCAo. We found, however, that PTX3
is a key regulator of neurogenesis after experimental
cerebral ischaemia; nestin-positive NSPCs in the dentate
gyrus (DG) of PTX3 KO mice were less abundant than
in WT mice (Figure 1A) 6 days after MCAo. Some of
these nestin-positive NSPCs were proliferating cells, as
shown by BrdU immunostaining (Figure 1C). There was
no significant difference between genotypes in the levels
of BrdU staining in the hippocampus (Figure 1B), but
PTX3 KO mice had significantly less BrdU staining in
the subventricular zone (SVZ) (Figure 1D and E), and a
similar trend, although not significant, was observed for
nestin (Figure 1D and F) and DCX staining (Figure 1G).
No BrdU, nestin or DCX-positive cells were seen in the
contralateral hemisphere (except for a low number of
BrdU-positive cells in the SVZ where proliferation of
progenitor cells is seen even at baseline [28] (data not
shown)). However, newly formed mature neurones
(BrdU-NeuN positive) were not found in any area of the
brain, not even 14 days after MCAo (Figure 1H).

To confirm our in vivo observations, we tested the effect
of PTX3 on neurogenesis in vitro; treatment of WT neurosphere cultures with recombinant mouse PTX3 resulted
in an increase in proliferation indicated by an increase in
BrdU incorporation (Figure 1I and J). The number of neurospheres was also significantly increased after PTX3
treatment of WT cells, and this effect was absent in IL-1β
KO cultures (Figure 1K), suggesting that endogenous IL-1
is necessary for the neurogenic effect of PTX3.
Lack of PTX3 impairs angiogenesis after middle cerebral
artery occlusion

Since neurogenesis is coupled with angiogenesis in
the injured brain [15], we tested whether PTX3 also
promotes angiogenesis after experimental stroke. Lack
of PTX3 did not significantly affect the levels of
PECAM-1 staining 48 h (Figure 2A) or 6 days (Figure 2B)
after MCAo, although there was a trend towards
decreased PECAM-1 staining in PTX3 KO mice. In contrast, PECAM-1 staining was significantly reduced in
PTX3 KO mice 14 days after MCAo, compared to WT
mice (Figure 2C). To confirm that this variation in
PECAM-1 staining was due to angiogenesis, we quantified
the amount of BrdU incorporated within the vascular
endothelium. After 6 days (Figure 3A,B and C) and 14 days
(Figure 3D,E and F) post-MCAo, several blood vessels had
incorporated BrdU. Lack of PTX3 significantly affected
the amount of proliferating vessels 14 days (Figure 3E) but
not 6 days (Figure 3B) after MCAo. To determine if the
reduced amount of vascular BrdU was only due to the
fact that PTX3 KO mice had fewer blood vessels, we
normalised the amount of BrdU to the amount of
PECAM-1 staining (Figures 3C and F). This also indicated
a significant deficit in angiogenesis in PTX3 KO mice
14 days after MCAo. In addition to fewer proliferating
vessels, PTX3 KO mice had less vascular VEGFR2 staining
14 days after MCAo (Figure 4A), both as percentage of
the total area (Figure 4B) and when normalised and
expressed as percentage of the PECAM-1-positive area
(Figure 4C). VEGF exerts a potent pro-angiogenic effect
through the activation of VEGFR2 [29], whose levels
increase after ischaemia [30].
We also tested the effect of PTX3 on cellular proliferation
in vitro, using a mouse endothelial cell line, bEnd.5.
The addition of PTX3 to bEnd.5 cultures induced a
significant increase in cellular proliferation (Figure 5A,B).
Morphological assessment of cultures showed that
cells formed tube-like structures confirming the potent
pro-angiogenic effect of PTX3.
Lack of PTX3 leads to worse functional recovery after
experimental stroke

Increased neurogenesis has been linked with improved
neurobehavioral function after stroke [31]. To determine

Figure 1 PTX3 promotes neurogenesis in vivo after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and in vitro. Less nestin-positive profiles are
found in the dentate gyrus (DG) of PTX3 knockout (KO) mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice 6 days after MCAo (A) although BrdU levels in
that area are not significantly different (B). BrdU-nestin double immunofluorescence reveals some proliferating nestin-positive cells (C).
BrdU-nestin staining in the subventricular zone (SVZ) (D) shows that PTX3 KO mice have significantly less BrdU staining than WT mice in
that area 6 days after MCAo (E), and the same trend, although not significant, is observed for nestin (F) and DCX (G). Images show no
colocalisation between BrdU and NeuN in the SVZ, striatum or hippocampus 14 days after MCAo, indicating that newly formed neurones might not
be mature at this time point (H). PTX3 (100 ng/ml) induces neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation, as shown by BrdU/DAPI ratio after 24 h

Figure 2 Lack of PTX3 reduces striatal vascular density during the recovery phase after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo).
PECAM-1 staining in the striatum of wild-type (WT) and PTX3 knockout (KO) mice was quantified, showing that PTX3 KO mice have significantly
less vasculature 14 days after MCAo (C). A similar trend, although not significant, is seen 48 h (A) or 6 days (B) post MCAo. Scale bars = 50 μm.

whether the lack of PTX3 had an effect on behavioural
outcome, several tests were carried out analyzing basic
parameters of activity, exploratory behaviour, motor
function and memory, 14 days after MCAo, when no difference in infarct size between genotypes was observed
(Figure 6A). The amount of time mobile, the number of
lines crossed and the number of rearings within an open
field test were used to study alterations in general activity
and exploratory behaviour, but no significant differences
between genotypes were identified (Figure 6B). The
proportion of anti-clockwise rotations was significantly
higher in PTX3 KO mice (93% anti-clockwise rotations on
average, compared to the 50% that would correspond to a
healthy mouse) (Figure 6C). Although not significant,
WT mice also displayed rotational bias (Figure 6C).
Rotational bias indicates a lateral motor deficit, consequence of the unilateral MCAo. The score reflecting
general motor activity, however, did not vary between
genotypes (Figure 6D). Short term memory, measured
in a Y maze, was not significantly affected by the lack
of PTX3, although a trend indicated that PTX3 KO
mice could have a slight memory deficit compared to
WT mice (Figure 6E).

Discussion
Here we show for the first time that the acute phase
protein PTX3, a biomarker of stroke severity [7], is a key
regulator of neurogenesis and angiogenesis after cerebral
ischaemia, and that it has an impact on the recovery of
motor function.
The role of PTX3 in neurogenesis had never been
studied. PTX3 has been shown to participate in other
post stroke responses such as resolution of oedema and
glial scar formation [1]; here we observe that, 6 days
after the ischaemic event, PTX3 promotes repair in the
form of neurogenesis, especially in the hippocampus.
However, since nestin only marks an early stage of
differentiation [32], further research is required to
explore whether PTX3 has an effect in the final stages of
NSPC differentiation and functional integration. We
observed a decrease in BrdU staining, but not in NSPCs
in PTX3 KO mice in the SVZ. This could be due to a
decrease in glial proliferation in PTX3 KO mice which has
been reported after stroke [1]. It is worth mentioning that
infarct size did not significantly differ between WT and
PTX3 KO mice at this time (6 days post-MCAo) [1].
Although there was a trend towards a bigger infarct size

with the total amount of PECAM-1 (E) and (F). Scale bars = 50 μm. Students t-test (n = 4) was used. *P <0.05. Error bars show SEM.

in PTX3 KO mice at that time, the opposite trend was
observed 14 days after MCAo, suggesting that the lack of
PTX3 is not a strong modulator of infarct size. Other
parameters affected by the lack of PTX3 such as BBB
breakdown [1] could indirectly affect early neurogenesis.
However, our in vitro findings, which show that PTX3
treatment induces NSPC proliferation, indicate that PTX3

is a direct endogenous neurogenic mediator. Interestingly,
the neurogenic effect of PTX3 in vitro was abrogated
in IL-1β KO cultures. IL-1 is known to facilitate
neurogenesis [33], and our results suggest that PTX3
could be involved in that process.
The role of PTX3 in angiogenesis is more controversial.
In peripheral tissues, PTX3 has been described as an anti-

Figure 6 PTX3 knockout (KO) mice have increased rotational bias 14 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). No significant
difference is observed in infarct size between genotypes 14 days after MCAo, as quantified on cresyl violet-stained coronal brain sections (A). Open
field test revealed no difference in parameters reflecting general anxiety and activity such as time mobile, number of line crossings and number of
rearings (B). Rotational bias was significant in PTX3 KO but not in wild-type (WT) mice (C) and general motor activity was not affected by the lack of

angiogenic factor in vitro and in matrigel or alginate bead
implants ex vivo [34,35]. In contrast, our data show that
PTX3 exerts pro-angiogenic actions on the cerebrovascular endothelium, indicating that PTX3 actions could be
different in the brain after injury compared to peripheral
organs. Indeed, our earlier studies showed that central and
peripheral PTX3 expression is differently regulated [1].
Supporting a beneficial role for PTX3 in angiogenesis, the
lack of PTX3 reduced the amount of capillaries in the
reperfused area, as well as inducing a worse outcome in a
study of cardiac ischaemia [36]. The effect of PTX3 in
other mechanisms of repair [1] may benefit the overall
recovery and indirectly facilitate angiogenesis, overruling
the anti-angiogenic actions of PTX3. Baldini and colleagues
found elevated levels of both PTX3 and VEGF in samples
of patients suffering from arterial inflammation [37], and
we observed a lower amount of VEGFR2 in blood vessels
of PTX3 KO mice. VEGF is thought to be produced by
astrocytes after cerebral ischaemia [38,39] and then binds
to VEGFR2 in endothelial cells, promoting angiogenesis
[40]. Lower VEGFR2 levels could reflect a lower level of

VEGF. Further research is required to explore the role
of PTX3 in VEGF production. Since microglial-derived
factors can also promote angiogenesis [41], reduced
microglial proliferation (which is also observed in PTX3
KO mice [1]) could be an additional mechanism by
which the lack of PTX3 impairs angiogenesis. Decreased
angiogenesis in PTX3 KO mice could partly account for a
decreased amount of neurogenesis since it is well known
that both processes are linked [15]. Interestingly, IL-1
promotes angiogenesis [42] as well as neurogenesis
[33]. After cerebral ischaemia, IL-1 is known to drive
PTX3 expression [1], which would, in turn, facilitate
angiogenesis and neurogenesis. These observations highlight the importance of PTX3 and IL-1 in brain repair.
Discriminating between early IL-1 noxious actions [11]
and late IL-1 repair-promoting actions, such as those
observed here, is necessary to choose the appropriate time
of administration of anti-inflammatory treatments. This
is essential to avoid unwanted blockade of repair mediators such as PTX3, which require a certain degree of
pro-inflammatory molecules.

In terms of behaviour, lack of PTX3 caused a significant
increase in rotational bias, which occurs as a consequence
of the unilateral brain damage and reflects asymmetric
motor function [43] and may indicate the slower recovery
of contralateral motor function in PTX3 KO mice. Since
there were no new mature neurones (NeuN-positive)
at the time when behavioural tests were performed,
differences in behaviour might not be attributed to
differences in neurogenesis alone. Reduced angiogenic
responses in PTX3 KO are likely to contribute to worse
tissue perfusion and delayed reorganization of injured
neuronal pathways. Reduced angiogenesis could also
affect the function of surviving neurones, and reduced
angiogenic responses could contribute to delayed recovery
after stroke [44].

Conclusions
We have shown here that PTX3 is a key mediator of
angiogenesis and neurogenesis after cerebral ischaemia, and has a beneficial impact on recovery of
lateral motor function. These observations highlight
further the relevance of PTX3 as a potential target
for stroke recovery. In the long term, this could have
important clinical implications given the increasing
incidence of stroke and the lack of treatments targeting
the recovery phase.
