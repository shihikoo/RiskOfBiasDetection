a b s t r a c t
Two types of macrophages in lesion core of rat stroke model were identiﬁed according to NG2 chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycan (NG2) and CD200 expression. NG2+ macrophages were CD200−, and vice versa. NG2− macrophages expressed two splice variants of CD200 that are CD200L and CD200S. CD200+ macrophages expressed
CD8, CD68, CD163, CCL2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-1β, Toll-like receptor 4 and transforming
growth factor β, whilst NG2+ cells expressed a costimulatory factor CD86. Both cell types expressed insulinlike growth factor 1 and CD200R. These results demonstrate that the two macrophage types cannot be classiﬁed
as either M1 or M2.

1. Introduction
Brain ischemia results in the death of most neurons and glial
cells within the lesion core. Following the onset of ischemic events,
granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes leave the blood stream
and invade the ischemic lesion (Matsumoto et al., 2007a; Chu et al.,
2014). Monocyte-derived macrophages were the most abundant cells
within the ischemic core of a rat stroke model (Matsumoto et al.,
2008). We reported that the majority of macrophages expressed an
oligodendrocyte progenitor cell marker, NG2 chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (NG2), and a macrophage/microglia-marker Iba1, and we
named these cells ‘brain Iba1 +/NG2 + cells’ (BINCs). BINCs were
found to express a variety of neuroprotective factors including insulin-

like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
(Smirkin et al., 2010). When BINCs were transplanted in the ischemic
core, they exerted neuroprotective effects on the ischemic brain and
suppressed rat deaths. We concluded that BINCs played a neuroprotective role.
We have previously noted the presence of CD200-expressing
macrophages in the ischemic core of ischemic rats (Matsumoto
et al., 2007b). CD200 is an integral membrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin-superfamily, and is expressed by several
cell types, including neurons and endothelial cells of rodent and
human brains (Wright et al., 2000, 2001). CD200 expressed on neurons interacts with CD200 receptor (CD200R), expressed by myeloid
lineage cells including resident microglia, blood-borne macrophages
and granulocytes (Hoek et al., 2000; Wright et al., 2000, 2003). Neuronal expression of CD200 is believed to maintain microglial cells in a
“resting” state by preventing proinﬂammatory activation (Ransohoff
and Cardona, 2010).
In recent years, two modes of macrophage activation, classical (M1type) and alternative (M2-type), have been described for ischemic brain
pathology according to Th1/Th2 polarization of T lymphocytes (Neurath

et al., 2002). The M1 phenotype is induced by proinﬂammatory cytokines, in particular interferon-γ, and by pathogen-associated molecular
patterns, typically lipopolysaccharides (LPS). M1 macrophages may be
engaged in antigen presentation through costimulatory factors CD80
and CD86. IL-4 is associated with polarization to M2 phenotypes, with
some phenotypic subsets secreting the anti-inﬂammatory cytokines
TGFβ and IL-10. It has been reported that M1 and M2-polarizations
occur kinetically after the onset of ischemic events, and that M1polarization may be neurotoxic, whereas M2-polarization is neuroprotective (Hu et al., 2012). M2 macrophages and microglia were shown
to contribute to the regeneration and repair of damaged brain tissue
(Donega et al., 2014).
It is likely that the interaction between CD200 and its receptor
CD200R is associated with polarization of macrophages accumulated
in the ischemic brain, as previously suggested in studies with various
experimental paradigms (Wright et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2011;
Hernangomez et al., 2012; Denieffe et al., 2013). Although there is
much literature describing the presence of M1 and M2 macrophages
and microglia in ischemic rodent brains (Perego et al., 2011; Hu et al.,
2012; Zarruk et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2013), there are few studies
demonstrating the immunohistochemical characterization of these
cells.
In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the presence of two distinct types of macrophages in the core of ischemic lesions using immunohistochemical staining, with special reference to CD200 and
NG2. A splice variant of CD200, identiﬁed in the current study, was
described elsewhere (Chen et al., 2008). The variant was recognized
by a goat polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminal sequence
of CD200, but not by OX2, a monoclonal antibody consistently used
for the detection of CD200 molecules. To distinguish between the
two CD200 molecules, the molecule recognized with the OX2 antibody
was termed CD200L, and the molecule recognized by the goat antibody,
CD200S.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and surgical procedures
The experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experimentation of Ehime University Graduate
School of Medicine. Adult male Wistar rats (8 to 10 weeks old;
body weight, 250 to 310 g; Charles River Japan, Yokohama, Japan)
were used for all experiments. Transient (90 min) middle cerebral

artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed as described elsewhere
(Matsumoto et al., 2007a). Ischemic rats were transcardially perfused
with chilled PBS, 2-mm-thick brain sections prepared and stained
with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium hydrochloride (TTC; Wako, Osaka,
Japan) at 7 days post-reperfusion (dpr), and the ischemic region evaluated (Fig. 1).
2.2. RNA isolation and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis
The rats subjected to MCAO were deeply anesthetized with ethyl
ether at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 14 dpr. The brains were dissected and 2-mmthick coronal sections through the caudoputamen were prepared.
Total RNA were extracted from tissue homogenates of cerebral cortices in the ischemic core, peri-ischemic region and contralateral cortex. For quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) was performed as
described elsewhere (Sugimoto et al., 2014). Total RNA was isolated
from each region using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from
DNase I-treated RNA (1.5 μg) using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Tokyo, Japan) and oligo (dT) 15 primer. cDNA was diluted
1:3, and triplicate volumes of 1 μL used for qPCR on a MJ mini instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using Fast Start Universal SYBR Green
(Roche Diagnostic Japan, Tokyo, Japan). All gene-speciﬁc mRNA
expression measurements were normalized to glyceraldehyde 3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression levels. The primer
sequences are listed in Table 1. GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega,
Madison, WI) was used to amplify CD200 fragments from cDNA isolated from cultured macrophages. Ampliﬁed DNA fragments were
visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis as previously described
(Matsumoto et al., 2008).
2.3. Isolation of macrophages in ischemic core
Macrophages were isolated from the ischemic hemisphere at 7 dpr
and cultured as described elsewhere (Matsumoto et al., 2008). Brieﬂy,
the brain was dissected, and the ischemic hemisphere minced with scissors and triturated using a Pasteur pipette in 10 ml phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) containing 0.05% (v/v) ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 5 min. The minced tissue was
ﬁltered through a 160 μm pore nylon mesh bag, and centrifuged to
collect the cells. The isolated cells were seeded on polystyrene dishes
suitable for suspension cultures (Sumitomo, Akita, Japan) and incubated for 30 min in a CO2 incubator. Macrophage/microglial lineage
cells, but not neuroectodermal cells, preferentially attached to the
dishes (Tanaka et al., 1998). The cells were washed with warm
DMEM containing 3% fetal bovine serum to remove unattached cells.
2.4. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of CD200 expressed by isolated
brain macrophages
A cDNA pool isolated from macrophages of ischemic rat brains was
prepared and CD200 cDNA ampliﬁed by PCR using the following

cerebral cortex at the caudoputamen level of ischemic rat brain are shown. The brain was

primers; forward 5′-TAAGGCAAGCTGTCCCAGAG-3′, reverse 5′-ATGC
GGCCGCTTATTTCATTCTTTG CATCCCCCTG-3′. The PCR product was
cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and the
DNA sequence analyzed on an ABI 3500 genetic analyzer (ABI, Foster
City, CA). E. coli colonies bearing pGEM T-easy vector carrying both
long and short form cDNAs were obtained. The coding sequence for
the long form CD200 cDNA was the same as for commercially available CD200 cDNA (Origene, Rockville, MD).
2.5. Immunoblotting and competitive inhibition experiments
Ischemic brain tissue (contralateral, peri-ischemic and ischemic core
regions) were homogenized in a sonicator and lysed in Laemmli's
sample solution. Lysates were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with anti-CD200 antibodies
listed in Table 2. Blots were visualized with alkaline phosphataselabeled secondary antibodies (Promega) using 5-bromo-4-chloro3-indolylphosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) and nitroblue tetrazolium
(Sigma-Aldrich) as substrate (Tanaka et al., 1998). To conﬁrm the
speciﬁcity of CD200 immunoreactivity observed for the blots, competitive inhibition experiments using a blocking peptide (sc-14388P; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) with a C-terminal sequence of
rat CD200 were performed. Diluted antibody solutions (1:500) were incubated with sc-14388P (4 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. The
blots were then incubated with the antibody/sc-14388P mixture overnight at 4 °C.
2.6. Immunohistochemistry
The indirect immunoﬂuorescence method employed was as described elsewhere (Sugimoto et al., 2014) using the primary antibodies
listed in Table 2. Brieﬂy, ischemic rat brains were ﬁxed by transcardial
perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) containing 2 mM MgCl2. The dissected brains were immersed in
15% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C overnight, rapidly frozen in dry ice powder,
and sliced through the caudoputamen into 10-μm-thick coronal
sections using a cryostat microtome. The brain sections were incubated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with DyLight 488, DyLight 549, and/or

9

DyLight 649-labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch,
West Grove, PA). Hoechst 33342 was used for nuclear staining.
Rhodamine-labeled tomato lectin (TL; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as
a marker for macrophages. The immunostained specimens were
observed with a conventional microscope (BX-52, Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan), a Nikon A1 confocal laser scan microscope (CLSM; Nikon,
Tokyo, Japan), or a scanning ﬂuorescence microscope (BZ-9000; Keyence,
Osaka, Japan).

2.7. Cell counting
Cell counting was performed as described previously based on
micrographs from four ischemic rats taken with 20× lens of the CLSM
(Matsumoto et al., 2008). The immunostained specimens were prepared with the use of antibodies to CD200L, NG2, iNOS, and/or Ki67 as
well as TL on the printed micrographs.

2.8. Bone marrow transplantation
To determine whether macrophages in ischemic core were the
descendants of resident microglia, bone marrow transplantation experiments were done as described elsewhere (Smirkin et al., 2010). Bone
marrow cells were harvested from the femoral and tibial bones of
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats with ubiquitous expression of enhanced
green-ﬂuorescent protein (EGFP) (SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan). The harvested cells were injected through the tail vein to male Wistar recipient rats after whole-body irradiation to destroy the recipients' bone
marrow. Two months after the transplantation, the recipient rats
were subjected to transient MCAO. The transplanted rats were ﬁxed at
7 dpr.

2.9. Statistical analysis
Numerical data of qPCR expressed as the mean ± SEM were statistically analyzed using InStat3 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
Signiﬁcance was assessed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and Tukey's post hoc test. Cell-counting data were evaluated with unpaired t test.

Data presented on graphs is from three independent experiments and is expressed as the mean ± SEM. (A and B) Spatiotemporal changes in expression levels for mRNA encoding CD200 (A) and CD200R (B) in the core, peri-ischemic

form expressed by isolated brain macrophages. (D and E) CD8α (D) and CD8β (E) mRNA was highly expressed in the core at 7 dpr. *P b 0.05 vs Contra. (F) CD200 gene organization and PCR
primers used to detect CD200 variants. CD200S lacks sequences corresponding to exons 1, 2 and a part of 3. Splice variants of CD200 with long (CD200L) and short (CD200S) sequences are
visible in agarose gels. A and B denote the different sets of primers. Primer set A detected cDNA encoding CD200S, whereas primer set B did not. (G) cDNA sequences of CD200L and CD200S.
Exon 3 contains a premature STOP codon because of the loss of exon 2. The loss of amino acid sequences encoded by exons 1, 2 and a part of 3 in splice variant CD200S has been reported
elsewhere (Chen et al., 2008). (H) Expression levels of mRNA encoding CD200 variants. CD200L was the predominant variant in the contralateral cortex and peri-lesion, whilst CD200S was
predominantly expressed in the core. *P b 0.05, ***P b 0.001, both vs CD200L. (I) Although not of statistical signiﬁcance, CD200S rather than CD200L was predominantly expressed by macrophages isolated from the ischemic brain, whilst the expression levels for both molecules was unaffected by exposure to LPS. (J) Immunoblotting conﬁrmed the presence of CD200L and
CD200S in lysates prepared from the contra, peri and core regions. A monoclonal antibody OX2 recognized two broad ~42 kDa bands predominant in the contra sample. A goat antibody
against the C terminal sequence of CD200 recognized a thin band of ~42 kDa that was prevalent in the core. The C-terminal sequence bands disappeared following preincubation of the
anti-C-terminal antibody with the C-terminal peptide, whereas preincubation did not affect the OX2-immunoreactive bands.

of which expressed NG2 (yellow arrows). NG2−/Iba1+ cells were also observed (blue arrows). (B) Double-staining to detect CD200L and Iba1 immunoreactivity distinguishes three types

CD200R. NG2+ cells were stained more weakly with TL than CD200L+ cells. (E) NG2 and CD200R immunoreactivity was located at the plasma membrane. Generally NG2+ cells expressed
CD200R at higher levels than CD200L+ or NG2− cells. (F) Percentages of CD200+/NG2− and CD200−/NG2+ TL+ cells in the ischemic cortex and the corpus callosum. Cells were counted on

and the statistical analysis was performed by unpaired t-test (***P b 0.001). A few cells (less than 1% of total counted cells) that were obscurely immunostained or difﬁcult to be classiﬁed to
either cell types were excluded for the analysis.

3. Results
Spatiotemporal qPCR analysis revealed little change to CD200
mRNA expression levels during the course of the study following
tMCAO (Fig. 2A). The primer set used in the analysis was speciﬁc
for CD200, and as such ampliﬁed mRNA encoding both CD200L and
CD200S. There was no marked difference in the levels of CD200
mRNA detected in the contralateral cerebral cortex (Contra; the investigated region is shown in Fig. 1), the peri-ischemic region
(Peri) and the ischemic core (Core). A small increase in CD200 mRNA
detected in the ischemic core at 1 day post-reperfusion (dpr) may be
associated with an invasion of blood-borne CD200+ cells (Matsumoto
et al., 2007a).
On the other hand, the marked increase in CD200 receptor
(CD200R) mRNA expression in the core at 5 to 7 dpr was associated
with macrophage accumulation, including BINCs, in the ischemic
core (Matsumoto et al., 2008) (Fig. 2B). There are several known
types of CD200 receptors (Gorczynski et al., 2004). In the current
study, CD200R1 and R2-mRNA expression levels were investigated.
Only CD200R1-mRNA was detected in brain macrophages isolated
from the ischemic core at 7 dpr (Fig. 2C). mRNA expression levels
for both receptors remained unaffected by LPS treatment. CD8α
and β mRNA was detected in the core at 7 dpr (Fig. 2D and E). A splice
variant of CD200 devoid of exons 1 and 2, and containing partial exon
3-derived sequences has been reported previously (Borriello et al.,
1998; Chen et al., 2008). mRNA encoding a splice variant with a
shorter sequence, referred to as CD200S, was observed in the current
study (Fig. 2F). Splicing of exon 2 caused a frame shift, resulting in
the appearance of a premature stop codon within the sequence of
exon 3, generating CD200S (Fig. 2G). CD200 deduced from fulllength mRNA was termed CD200L. qPCR was performed using
two sets of primers speciﬁc for either CD200L- or CD200S-mRNA
(Fig. 2H). CD200S-mRNA was expressed at higher levels in the core,
whereas CD200L-mRNA was expressed at higher levels in the Contra
and Peri regions. Overnight incubation of isolated brain macrophages
with LPS marginally increased CD200L and CD200S expression (Fig. 2I).
Immunoblot analysis showed monoclonal antibody OX2 recognized two broad bands of approximate Mr. 42 kDa (Fig. 2J). These
broad bands may be attributable to glycosylation of CD200 (Barclay
and Ward, 1982; Matsumoto et al., 2007b). A goat polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping to the C-terminus of CD200
of rat origin (Santa Cruz; Table 2) reacted with a single, thin band,
which was distinct from the OX2-immunoreactive bands (Fig. 2J).
OX2-immunoreactive proteins were most abundant in the contralateral
cortex, whilst the protein recognized by the goat antibody was most

13

prevalent in the core. Pre-incubation of antibodies with a blocking
peptide containing the C-terminal sequence completely abolished the
immunoreactive bands recognized by the goat antibody, whilst OX2immunoreactive bands remained unaffected. Taken together, the
results of qPCR and immunoblotting suggest that OX2 and the goat
antibody are speciﬁc for CD200L and CD200S, respectively. This result
was unexpected as the C-terminal sequence is present in both CD200
molecules. It is possible that OX2 may recognize a sequence of ~ 80
amino acids encoded by exons 1–3, which are absent in CD200S. In
addition, CD200L might undergo post-translational modiﬁcations at
its C-terminal sequence, including deletions, which may cause loss
of reactivity to the goat anti-C terminal sequence of CD200.
At 7 dpr, a large number of macrophages had accumulated in the
ischemic core of rat brains. There were NG2+/Iba1+ and NG2−/Iba1+
cells in the ischemic cerebral cortex (yellow and blue arrows, respectively in Fig. 3A) as has been described (Matsumoto et al., 2008).
Iba1+/NG2+ macrophages had a tendency to form large aggregates,
whereas NG2− macrophages did not (Fig. 3A). Furthermore,
CD200L+/Iba1+, CD200L−/Iba1+, and CD200L+/Iba1− cells were
found (Fig. 3 B). CD200L+/Iba1− cells may be endothelial cells
(Fig. 3B, see also Fig. 4E) (Ko et al., 2009). CD200L+ cells were NG2−,
and vice versa (Fig. 3C). Although CD200R immunoreactivity was
widely observed in tomato lectin+ (TL +) macrophages (Fig. 3D),
NG2+ cells displayed stronger CD200R immunoreactivity than
NG2− cells. TL stained NG2 + cells more weakly than NG2 − cells.
NG2 was apparently co-localized with CD200R (Fig. 3E). The proportion of NG2+/Iba1+ or CD200L+/Iba1+ macrophages in the total TL+
macrophages was differed by the region addressed; 73.8% of the total
macrophages were Iba1+/NG2+ in the cerebral cortex, whereas 55.9%
in the corpus callosum (Fig. 3F and Table 3).
Scanning micrographs illustrate the distribution of CD200L, NG2,
and Iba1 within the right hemisphere at 7 dpr (Fig. 4). Immunoreactive
CD200L was diffusely distributed in the non-ischemic cerebral cortex
(Fig. 4Aa), whilst they were notably absent from the non-ischemic corpus callosum. Iba1+ macrophages were widely distributed throughout
the ischemic lesion (Fig. 4Ab) including the degenerated corpus
callosum. NG2+ macrophages were generally present in the ischemic
cerebral cortex and at the periphery of the striatum (Fig. 4Bb). Micrographs (Fig. 4C) showing a square region denoted C in Fig. 4B identiﬁed
the location of CD200L and CD200S immunoreactivity. Although NG2+
macrophages expressed neither CD200L nor CD200S, they were
surrounded by highly immunoreactive CD200L within regions where
no nuclei stained with Hoechst 33342. CD200L+/Iba1+ macrophages
within the degenerated corpus callosum expressed CD200S+ (Fig. 4D).
Presumable endothelial cells expressed CD200L but not CD200S.
Actually, tubular CD200L+ structure expressed von Willebrand factor (vWF), a marker for endothelial cells (Fig. 4 E), indicating that
CD200L+/Iba1− cells were endothelial cells. Diffuse CD200L immunoreactivity devoid of CD200S-immunoreactivity (Fig. 4C) was
widely distributed in the cerebral cortex (Fig. 4F and G). CD200L+
macrophages appeared in contact with each other in the corpus
callosum in the ischemic core (Fig. 4H), and there were no apparent
extracellular CD200L+ deposits. These results suggest that degenerated
cortex neurons were the most likely sources for the diffuse CD200Limmunoreactivity observed in the ischemic core.

Macrophage expression of CD8, CD68 and CD163 is shown in
Fig. 5. The presence of CD8+ macrophages in the lesions of several
models of neurological disorders including stroke has been demonstrated (Schroeter et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2006; Hiraki et al.,
2009). CD8+ macrophages were present in abundance in the ischemic core, and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy
revealed the presence of large phagosome-like structures within
their cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). CD8+ macrophages were NG2− (Fig. 5B).
Macrophages expressing CD68, a marker of active phagocytosis (Perego
et al., 2011), also bore phagosome-like granules in their cytoplasm
(Fig. 5C). The potential M2 macrophage marker CD163 (Mantovani
et al., 2004; Durafourt et al., 2012) was expressed by some macrophages
present in the core; NG2 was not expressed (Fig. 5D). CD200+, CD200R+

and CD8+ macrophages were bone marrow-derived as revealed by
bone marrow transplantation experiments using transgenic rats
expressing enhanced green ﬂuorescence protein (EGFP; Fig. 6), suggesting that the macrophages were not the derivative of activated
resident microglia.
TL+ macrophages in the ischemic core expressed CD11b, a possible
marker for M1 macrophages (Hu et al., 2012) (Fig. 7A). No apparent
differences in CD11b-immunoﬂuorescence were observed between
NG2+ and NG2− cells. CD68 was expressed solely by NG2− macrophages (Fig. 7B). Whilst, CD86, a costimulatory factor and a presumable
M1 marker (Hu et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2013), was localized to NG2+
cells (Fig. 7C). NG2+ cells were highly proliferative, as conﬁrmed by
immunohistochemical staining with the cycling cell marker Ki67

(Ad) were observed. CD8−/Iba1+ cells generally smaller and more irregular in shape were devoid of visible granular structures (blue arrowheads). (B) CD8+ cells were generally NG2−
(pink arrowheads). Blue arrowheads denote presumptive NG2+ macrophages. (C) CD68+/Iba1+ cells had distinct granules in their cytoplasm (pink arrowheads). Blue arrowheads denote
CD68−/Iba1+ cells with no visible granules. (D) CD163+ cells were NG2− (yellow arrowheads), whereas NG2+ cells did not express CD163 (blue arrowheads).

(Fig. 7D), and was consistent with observations described elsewhere
(Matsumoto et al., 2008). Less than 5% of CD200L+ cells were Ki67+
(Figs. 7E and 8A). CD8+ cells, presumably belonging to NG2− cell
groups, were Ki67− (Fig. 7F). The proportion and the actual counted
cell number of Ki67+ cells for each cell type subjected to statistical analyses and the results presented in Fig. 8A and Table 4.
The nature of NG2+ and NG2− cell populations was investigated
further using antibodies to M1 and M2 functional markers (Fig. 9). As
shown in Table 4, signiﬁcant number of TL+ macrophages expressed
iNOS, a typical marker for M1 macrophages (Hu et al., 2012; Zarruk
et al., 2012; Desestret et al., 2013). About a half of CD200L+/NG2− cell
expressed iNOS, whereas only 3% of NG2+ cells were iNOS+ (Fig. 8B,
Tables 4 and 5). A chemokine CCL2, also known as MCP-1, which has
been suggested as a possible marker of M1 cells by some authors
(Mantovani et al., 2004; Zarruk et al., 2012), was expressed only by
NG2− cells (Fig. 9B). Only NG2− cells expressed TGFβ, a typical antiinﬂammatory cytokine and a marker for M2 macrophages (Hu et al.,
2012; Sugimoto et al., 2014) (Fig. 9C). NG2− cells expressed Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4) (Fig. 9D), a receptor for LPS or damage-associated
molecular patterns such as HMGB1 (Qiu et al., 2008). CD200L+ cells
expressed iNOS (Fig. 9E) and IL-1β (Fig. 9F). As has been described elsewhere (Smirkin et al., 2010), both NG2+ (Fig. 9G) and NG2− macrophages expressed insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The results
obtained in the characterization of the two types of macrophages within
the ischemic core are summarized in Table 5.

4. Discussion
Much literature has described the existence of two distinct types of
macrophages in the ischemic brain (Perego et al., 2011; Hu et al.,
2012; Zarruk et al., 2012; Jin et al., 2014): classically activated (M1)
macrophages or alternatively activated (M2) macrophages (Kigerl
et al., 2009). M1 macrophages are responsible for inducing an inﬂammatory response via the release of proinﬂammatory cytokines and
chemokines, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, as well as the
expression of cell surface molecules such as costimulatory factors; this
inﬂammatory response is often said to aggravate tissue damage
(Wang et al., 2013). In contrast, M2 macrophages are considered to be
ameliorative for damaged tissues in the central nervous system (Kigerl
et al., 2009). The ameliorative effects may be attributed to phagocytosis
of degenerated cells and tissues, and to the release of growth factors or
neuroprotective factors. There is much literature describing markers
speciﬁc for M1 and M2 macrophages (Mantovani et al., 2004; Kigerl
et al., 2009; Durafourt et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2012; Patel et al., 2013).
Typically, iNOS is considered an appropriate marker for M1 cells as it
reinforces proinﬂammatory reactions in the tissue through the dilation
of blood vessels. Whilst, TGFβ is an appropriate marker for M2 cells as it
elicits anti-inﬂammatory effects by suppressing pro-inﬂammatory
activation of immune cells (Mantovani et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2012).
Two types of macrophages, NG2+ and NG2−, were observed within
the ischemic core, with the former the more prevalent type (Matsumoto

Fig. 6. EGFP+ macrophages in the ischemic core (the temporal cortex) of rats transplanted with the bone marrow of EGFP-transgenic rats. (A) Most CD200R+ cells within the ischemic core
expressed EGFP, indicative they were bone marrow-derived. Most EGFP+/CD200R+ cells possessed large cytoplasmic granules. (B) Most CD200+ cells were EGFP+, the majority of which
contained many cytoplasmic granules. (C) Both EGFP+/CD8+ (pink) and EGFP+/CD8− (yellow) cells were present.

Fig. 7. Expression of CD11b, CD68, CD86 and Ki67 by macrophages in the ischemic core at 7 dpr. (A) CD11b was ubiquitously expressed by both NG2+/TL+ (yellow arrowheads) and
NG2−/TL+ (blue arrowheads) macrophages. (B) CD68 was expressed by NG2− macrophages (blue arrowheads) but not by NG2+ cells (yellow arrowheads). NG2+ macrophages formed
large aggregates. (C) CD86 was expressed by NG2+ macrophages (yellow arrowheads) but not by NG2− cells (blue arrowheads). (D) Ki67 was expressed by most NG2+ macrophages
(yellow arrowheads). Most NG2− macrophages (blue arrowheads) did not express Ki67. (E) Most CD200L+ cells (blue arrowheads) were Ki67− and most CD200L− cells (yellow arrowheads) were Ki67+. (F) Most CD200Rstrong (yellow arrowheads) were Ki67+ and most CD200Rweak (blue arrowheads) were Ki67−. (G) CD8+ macrophages (blue arrowheads) were
generally Ki67−; CD8+ macrophages (yellow arrowheads) were generally Ki67+.

et al., 2008). The current study classiﬁed most TL+/Iba1+ macrophages
within the core of the ischemic lesion as either subtype CD200+/NG2−
or CD200−/NG2+. The latter subtype was previously termed BINCs
(Matsumoto et al., 2008). We investigated whether NG2+ and NG2−
cells could be classiﬁed as M1 or M2 types using immunohistochemical

staining. As shown in Table 5, CD200+/NG2− and CD200−/NG2+ cell
subtypes did not fully correlate with either M1 or M2 types. For example, CD200+/NG2− cells simultaneously expressed a M1 marker IL-1β
and a M2 marker TGFβ, whilst CD200−/NG2+ cells expressed a M1
marker CD86 but not a M2 marker CD163 (Durafourt et al., 2012).

Fig. 8. Percentages of Ki67+ (A) and iNOS+ (B) cells among NG2+ or CD200+ TL+ cells in
the cerebral cortex (Cortex) and striatum (Striatum) of the ischemic core. The percentages
were obtained by dividing the number of Ki67+ or iNOS+ cells by the total number
of NG2+ or CD200+ cells. Data obtained from the immunohistochemical staining of specimens derived from four ischemic rats are expressed as the mean ± SEM (*** P b 0.001).
Cell counting was conducted across four different × 20 optic ﬁelds for a single ischemic
rat. (A) Most NG2+ cells expressed Ki67, and most CD200L+ (denoted as 200 L+) cells
were Ki67−. (B) Most NG2+ cells were iNOS−, whereas CD200L+ cells were iNOS+.

Further to this, both CD200 +/NG2− and CD200 −/NG2 + macrophages expressed the typical neuroprotective factor, IGF-1. Hence,
these results are highly indicative that M1/M2 classiﬁcation may
not fully be applicable to macrophages in the core of ischemic rat
brain lesions. Fenn et al. (2014) reported that microglial cells incubated with IL-4, an inducer of M2 cells, displayed an M1 and M2mixed phenotype, as evidenced by the expression of M1 marker IL1β and M2 marker arginase.
Ischemic core CD200+/NG2− and CD200−/NG2+ macrophages
were bone marrow-derived as shown in Fig. 6 and elsewhere
(Smirkin et al., 2010). It is yet to be elucidated as to whether differences between these two cell types arise from disparities in their
microenvironment, or from their cell lineage. CD200−/NG2+ macrophages or BINCs were surrounded by CD200L+ debris. On the other
hand, the majority of CD200+/NG2− macrophages were located in
neuron-sparse areas such as the corpus callosum. Thus, degenerated
neuron-derived CD200L might be involved in the generation of
CD200−/NG2+/CD200R+ macrophages, in which proinﬂammatory
activation was largely inhibited, despite the presence of damageassociated molecular patterns such as HMGB1 (Qiu et al., 2008).
Two distinct subsets of circulating monocytes, CCR2−/CX3CR1high
and CCR2+/CX3CR1 low, have been reported (Geissmann et al.,
2003). CCR2−/CX3CR1high monocytes constitutively invade normal
tissue, whilst CCR2+/CX3CR1low monocytes preferentially invade inﬂamed tissue. Hence, CCR2+ monocytes may be a proinﬂammatory
subset. Actually, CCR2+/Iba1+ cells have been observed to attach to
vascular walls and to invade ischemic brain lesions (Tei et al., 2013).
CCL2 expressed by CD200+ macrophages might play a role in recruiting

17

CCR2+ macrophages. It would be worth investigating whether these
two monocyte subsets give rise to the two macrophage populations in
the ischemic brain.
As shown in Fig. 4, diffuse CD200 immunoreactivity was observed
in cell-free regions within the ischemic core of the cerebral cortex,
and was associated with CD200L and not CD200S. Diffuse CD200Limmunoreactivity may be a constituent of neuronal degenerative
debris and might actively suppress the proinﬂammatory response
of CD200−/NG2+/CD200R+ cells, leading to their less pro-inﬂammatory
characteristics than CD200+/NG2− cells, with the exception of CD86 expression. The fact that CD200−/NG2+ cells did not express CD68, suggests
that these cells are not actively engaged in phagocytosis of denatured tissue, and as such may inadvertently contribute to the abundance of
CD200+ remnants persisting in the cerebral cortex at 7 dpr. Hence,
CD200L+ remnants within the cerebral cortex may be responsible for
suppressing the proinﬂammatory nature of CD200−/NG2+ cells.
In the current study, CD200+/NG2− cells were shown to express
both CD200L and CD200S. Chen et al. (2008) reported the presence of
CD200S—a truncated form of CD200 devoid of exons 1 and 2, and
encoded by a partial sequence for exon 3—in LPS-stimulated dendritic
cells. The authors demonstrated that CD200S may function as an endogenous antagonist for the suppression of CD200L (Chen et al., 2008).
Despite direct cell–cell contact between CD200+/NG2−/CD200R+ cells
(Fig. 4), their proinﬂammatory characteristics were not suppressed
displaying an M1 rather than M2 phenotype. The speciﬁc expression
of CD200S by CD200+/NG2− cells might allow them to escape the suppression induced by CD200–CD200R interactions.
CD200−/NG2+ cells or BINCs predominantly formed large cell aggregates in the degenerated cerebral cortex, most probably because of their
highly proliferative nature, as reﬂected by the high proportion of Ki67+.
Macrophages isolated from ischemic brains, yielded both CD200+/
NG2− and CD200−/NG2+ populations in culture (Matsumoto et al.,
2007b). When the mixed macrophage population was transplanted into
the ischemic cerebral cortex of rats, large cell aggregates comprised almost solely of NG2+ cells formed in the recipients' brain (Smirkin
et al., 2010). Highly proliferative BINCs were almost completely
eliminated by the administration of 5-ﬂuoruracil (5FU), leading to
aggravated loss of brain tissue and to rat deaths. Transplantation of
BINCs into the ischemic cerebral cortex of 5FU-injected rats markedly reduced ischemia-induced loss of brain tissue. These results
strongly suggest that BINCs are ameliorative, preventing further tissue degeneration in the ischemic brain. In this context, BINCs may
more closely resemble M2 rather than M1 macrophages.
In a rat model of spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion injury, we
observed densely accumulated bone marrow-derived macrophages
within the lesion that expressed CD68 and IGF-1, but not NG2
(Nakata et al., 2011). These macrophages also expressed IL-1β and
TNFα, suggesting they were of M1-like phenotype. The high density
of CD68+ cells in the ischemic spinal cord lesion correlated well with
the severity of paresis. Thus, expression of CD68 may be an indicative
of an unfavorable macrophage population in the pathology of the

tissue from lesions accelerates tissue repair. As such, reduced expression
of CD200, CD68 and CD8 within lesions might prove a valuable index to

assess the validity of new interventions, such as cytokine treatment, in
providing better outcomes for severely damaged brains and spinal
cords (Nishihara et al., 2011).
