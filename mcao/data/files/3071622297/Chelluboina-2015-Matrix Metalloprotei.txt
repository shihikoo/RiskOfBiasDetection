Background and Purpose—Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have a central role in compromising the integrity of the
blood–brain barrier (BBB). The role of MMP-12 in brain damage after ischemic stroke remains unknown. The main
objective of the current study is to investigate the effect of MMP-12 suppression at an early time point before reperfusion
on the BBB damage in rats.
Methods—Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion. MMP-12 shRNA–
expressing plasmids formulated as nanoparticles were administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight. The involvement
of MMP-12 on BBB damage was assessed by performing various techniques, including Evans blue dye extravasation,
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, immunoblot, gelatin zymography, and immunofluorescence analysis.
Results—MMP-12 is upregulated ≈31-, 47-, and 66-fold in rats subjected 1–, 2-, or 4-hour ischemia, respectively, followed
by 1-day reperfusion. MMP-12 suppression protected the BBB integrity by inhibiting the degradation of tight-junction
proteins. Either intravenous or intra-arterial delivery of MMP-12 shRNA-expressing plasmid significantly reduced the
percent Evans blue dye extravasation and infarct size. Furthermore, MMP-12 suppression reduced the endogenous levels
of other proteases, such as tissue-type plasminogen activator and MMP-9, which are also known to be the key players
involved in BBB damage.
Conclusions—These results demonstrate the adverse role of MMP-12 in acute brain damage that occurs after ischemic
stroke and, thereby, suggesting that MMP-12 suppression could be a promising therapeutic target for cerebral ischemia.

T

he blood–brain barrier (BBB) is formed by the endothelial cells of cerebral microvessels, which are distinguished from peripheral endothelial cells by their lack
of fenestrations, minimal pinocytotic activity, and the tight
junctions (TJs).1 In addition to endothelial cells, the BBB is
composed of pericytes, astrocytes, neurons, and extracellular
matrix.2 Endothelial cells and pericytes are surrounded by the
extracellular matrix, which is composed of structural proteins,
such as collagen type-IV, laminin, fibronectin, elastin, thrombospondin, and various proteoglycans. The TJs between the
endothelial cells of the cerebral microvessels serve to restrict
blood-borne substances from entering the brain. The BBB
thus provides a dynamic interface between the peripheral circulation and the brain.
BBB disruption is an important contributing factor to brain
injury that occurs after ischemic stroke. The expression of
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the normal adult brain
is very low or undetectable. In the injured brain, MMPs are

expressed in various cell types, including resident and infiltrating inflammatory cells.3 However, the brain regions and
cellular sources of expression differ for the specific MMPs, as
well as the type, severity, and duration of injuries.4 Ischemia
leads to induction of MMPs, which contribute to BBB extracellular matrix degradation. The induction of these MMPs
may further perpetuate BBB TJ permeability, thereby leading to BBB leakage, leukocyte infiltration, brain edema, and
hemorrhage.2 MMP-2 and MMP-9 are considered the central
mediators of ischemic BBB disruption because of their ability
to degrade components of microvascular basal lamina, especially collagen type-IV, and to disrupt TJ proteins.5–8
Recent investigations highlighted the possible pathological role for MMP-12 in the context of ischemic stroke.9,10
MMP-12 is upregulated several fold higher than any other
MMPs tested after focal cerebral ischemia, and its suppression attenuated the ischemic brain damage.10 Also, MMP-12
is reported to activate other MMPs, such as pro-MMP-2 and

pro-MMP-3, which, in turn, can activate pro-MMP-1 and
pro-MMP-9.11 In addition, MMP-12 suppression after ischemia reduced MMP-9 activity in a rat model of focal cerebral
ischemia and indicated that MMP-12 could be an upstream
protease that can control the activity of other proteases, such
as MMP-2 and MMP-9.10 Other potential mechanisms that
could contribute to BBB integrity after MMP-12 suppression
include reduced interferon (IFN)-α release from neuronal
cells and tumor necrosis factor-α protein expression.12,13
Based on the reported data and our preliminary investigations, we hypothesize that MMP-12 suppression before commencement of reperfusion would inhibit TJ protein degradation
and BBB disruption and, thereby, attenuate the brain damage
that occurs after focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. We
determined the effect of nonviral, nanoparticle-mediated intravenous/intra-arterial delivery of MMP-12 shRNA–expressing
plasmid (M-12sh) on early brain damage in a rat model of
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. We report that a single dose of M-12sh formulation
before instigation or immediately after reperfusion attenuates
TJ protein degradation and preserves BBB integrity. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to explore the deleterious role
of MMP-12 on early brain damage after ischemic stroke.

Methods
Ethical Statement
All experiments were performed to comply with the Animal Research:
Reporting In Vivo Experiments guidelines.14 The Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Illinois College of
Medicine at Peoria approved all surgical interventions and postoperative animal care. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
guidelines. In addition, all the procedures that were performed on the
animals were in compliance with the approved Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee protocol.

Experimental MCAO Model
After the animals reached a weight of 260±5 g, they were subjected
to right MCAO procedure as previously described.13 After MCAO
procedure, all animals were treated with appropriate analgesics and
antibiotics and subjected to the approved postprocedural care.

Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as previously
described.10 The forward and reverse primer sequences of rat MMP12 used in this study have been reported earlier by our group.15
Reaction set-up for each cDNA sample was assembled using the IQ
SYBR Green Supermix kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions (see the online-only Data Supplement for
further details).

Evans Blue Dye Extravasation
Leakage of Evans blue dye (EBD) in the ischemic brain tissue indicative of BBB disruption was analyzed 2 hours after MCAO (2hI group) and 1 day after MCAO (sham group, 2h-I+1d-R group,
M-12shIV+2h-I+1d-R group, and M-12shIA+2h-I+1d-R group) using EBD (see the online-only Data Supplement for further details).

2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride Staining
Animals from various groups allocated for 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (Sigma) staining procedure were deeply anesthetized with

pentobarbital and then decapitated. Brains were then removed rapidly
and subjected to 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and infarct size measurement as described previously.10

Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as the mean±SEM. Statistical comparisons
were performed using Graph Pad Prism software (version 3.02).
Quantitative data from either immunoblot analysis, gelatin zymography, or EBD extravasation assay were evaluated for statistical
significance by 1-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple
comparison test. Differences in the values were considered significant at P<0.05.

Results
MMP-12 Is Upregulated After Ischemia and
Reperfusion
MMP-12 mRNA expression in the ischemic brains of rats was
predominantly upregulated after ischemia with or without
reperfusion. MMP-12 mRNA upregulation was also present
in rats subjected to ischemia for 1 hour, the lowest ischemic
duration tested, and, thereby, indicated that MMP-12 upregulation could occur early after ischemic injury. The upregulation was ≈2- to 3-fold in rats subjected to 1 or 2 hours of right
MCAO as compared with sham-operated animals. Prominent
upregulation of MMP-12 mRNA (≈25 fold versus sham) in
ipsilateral brain tissue was noticed in rats after 4 hours of
right MCAO (Figure 1A). MMP-12 mRNA expression was
further increased after reperfusion of the ischemic brain. It
was upregulated ≈31-, 47-, and 66-fold in rats subjected to
1-, 2-, or 4-hour ischemia, respectively, followed by 1-day
reperfusion. These results demonstrated that it was not only
the ischemia that contributes to MMP-12 mRNA upregulation, but also the reperfusion. In addition, MMP-12 mRNA
levels were increased proportionally with the duration of ischemia. Protein expression of MMP-12 in the ischemic brains
of rats was also increased after focal cerebral ischemia and
reperfusion. Unchanged expression profile of GAPDH across
various treatment groups confirmed the loading consistency
for the gels. Unlike MMP-12 mRNA, the increase in MMP12 protein expression was significant (P<0.05) in all the
ischemic rat brains tested, except the samples obtained from
animals subjected to a 1/2-hour right MCAO (Figure 1B).
Immunoflurorescence analysis also demonstrated a prominent increase in MMP-12 protein expression in the ischemia/
reperfusion-induced rat brain sections (see Figure IA in the
online-only Data Supplement). However, trends in protein
expression were similar to those of mRNA expression. MMP12 expression at 2-hour ischemia without reperfusion is colocalized with both microglia and neurons (see Figure IB in the
online-only Data Supplement).

TJ Protein Expression Status After Ischemia and
Reperfusion
The expression of TJ proteins, such as claudin-5, occludin, and
zona occludens (ZO)-1, was evaluated by immunoblot analysis in the ischemic brains of rats that were subjected to various
durations of ischemia with or without reperfusion as described
in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement. The protein
expression of claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 was prominent in

the brain tissue of sham-operated rats. As expected, a decrease
in expression of these TJ proteins is noticed after ischemia
with or without reperfusion (Figure 2A). Although not significant, expression of TJ proteins was decreased in animals
subjected to 1-hour ischemia (with or without reperfusion),
the lowest ischemic duration tested in the present investigation. The decrease in protein expression was prominent and
significant (P<0.05) in rats subjected to 2- or 4-hour ischemia
with or without reperfusion (Figure 2B). These results indicated that the degradation of TJ proteins in rats was initiated
as soon as the initiation of ischemia induction.

MMP-12 Knockdown After Cerebral Ischemia
Reduces BBB Damage
Based on the objectives of the current study and the results
presented in the previous sections of this article, we selected
2-hour ischemia and 1-day reperfusion as appropriate durations for the remaining experiments. M-12sh plasmids were
constructed in pSilencer 4.1-CMV neo vector as described in
the methods section of this article and synthesized from the
overnight bacterial culture. A recent report from our laboratory has demonstrated the in vivo efficiency of M-12sh in rats
when administered as a nonviral, nanoparticle formulation.10

In contrast to the previous study, wherein we administered
M-12sh formulation intravenously via tail vein 1 day after
reperfusion, in this study, the formulation was administered
at the end of the 2-hour ischemia. Leakage of intravenously
administered EBD into the ischemic brain tissue of rats that
were subjected to a 2-hour ischemia without reperfusion demonstrates the disruption of BBB and provides a substantial support for the timing of treatment adopted in the present study
(see Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). To achieve
the target delivery of our treatment and evaluate the differences with intravenous treatment, we injected the M-12sh
formulation to a separate group of rats intra-arterially via the
internal carotid artery with the help of a microcatheter, which
was introduced into internal carotid artery after removal of the
monofilament (see supplemental Figure III in the online-only
Data Supplement). The reduced (P<0.001) protein expression
of MMP-12 in the ischemic brain tissue of rats after intravenous or intra-arterial delivery of M-12sh formulation demonstrated the in vivo efficiency of M-12sh (Figure 3A). There
was no difference in intravenous and intra-arterial delivery of
M-12sh for MMP-12 protein expression. Previous experiments
demonstrated an absence of any difference between animals
not treated with plasmids and those treated with scrambled
sequence plasmids (vehicle controls). Thus, we did not use
vehicle controls in these studies. Immunoflurorescence analysis of the paraffin-embedded coronal brain sections obtained
from various groups of rats also demonstrated a prominent
decrease in the MMP-12 protein expression in the ischemia/
reperfusion-induced rat brain sections after M-12sh treatment
as compared with untreated rat brain sections (see Figure IA
in the online-only Data Supplement).
EBD extravasation into the ischemic brain was prominent
in rats subjected to a 2-hour right MCAO and 1-day reperfusion (Figure 3B). Either intravenous or intra-arterial delivery of M-12sh formulation significantly (P<0.05) reduced
the percent EBD extravasation from 33.09±4.58 in untreated
ischemia/reperfusion-subjected animals to 15.93±4.5 and
11.48±5.57, respectively. In addition, MMP-12 suppression
achieved after intravenous administration of M-12sh formulation significantly (P<0.05) reduced the infarct volume as
evidenced by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining
(Figure 3C). These results demonstrated that the knockdown
of MMP-12 after ischemia reduces the brain damage by protecting the integrity of the BBB. As expected, suppression of
MMP-12 after focal cerebral ischemia preserved the protein
expression of TJ proteins, such as claudin-5, occludin, and
ZO-1 (Figure 4). The increase in protein expression of these
TJ proteins in the ipsilateral brains of ischemia/reperfusioninduced rats is significant (P<0.001) after MMP-12 knockdown compared with untreated rats. In addition, all these
TJ proteins are colocalized with astrocytes in the ischemic
brain regions of untreated, ischemia/reperfusion-induced rats
(Figure 5A). However, the colocalization of astrocytes with
the TJ proteins was absent in sham-operated and M-12shtreated rats. Colocalization of TJ proteins with endothelial
cells was seen in the ischemic hemisphere of sham-operated
and M-12sh-treated rats (Figure 5B). However, the TJ protein expression was less associated with endothelial cells in

3526  Stroke  December 2015
ischemia, untreated rats. Altogether, these results indicate that
the early release or increased expression of MMP-12 in the
brain, in response to focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion,
degrades the TJ proteins, which constitutes the BBB and,
thereby, contributes to the disruption of BBB and early brain
damage.

Influence of MMP-12 Knockdown on Other
Proteases, Such as MMP-9 and Tissue-Type
Plasminogen Activator

Gelatin zymography revealed a prominent increase in
MMP-9 activity after reperfusion in rats subjected to various durations of ischemia (Figure 6A). The increase was
significant (P<0.001) in rats subjected to 2 hours of ischemia followed by 1-day reperfusion as compared with
sham group (Figure 6B). Administration of M-12sh formulation by either intravenous or intra-arterial route before
reperfusion significantly (P<0.001) reduced the increased
MMP-9 activity. Although some reduction in MMP-2 was
observed after MMP-12 suppression, especially when the
formulation was administered by intra-arterial route, this
reduction was not significant. Further, MMP-12 suppression did not affect MMP-3 protein expression as it did to
the MMP-9 expression (see Figure IV in the online-only
Data Supplement).
The protein expression of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) was significantly (P<0.001) increased in rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (Figure 6C
and 6D). Unchanged expression profile of GAPDH across
various treatment groups confirmed the loading consistency
for the gels. MMP-12 knockdown, irrespective of the route of
administration, significantly (P<0.001) reduced the increased
tPA expression. There was no significant difference in MMP-9
activity and tPA expression after MMP-12 knockdown compared with sham group.

Discussion
A pathogenetic role for MMP-12 after ischemic stroke has
been recently reported by our group.10 Of all the MMPs,
MMP-12 showed the highest upregulation at all the time points
tested after focal cerebral ischemia. The results of the current
study further demonstrated that it is not only the ischemia that
induces MMP-12 expression in the ischemic brain, but also
the reperfusion that contributes to predominant and significant
elevation of MMP-12 (Figure 1). Although the pathological
role of this matrix metalloelastase is reasonably documented
in lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, and asthma, this important protease has not
been well-studied, despite its detrimental role in the context of
ischemic stroke. MMP-12 suppression after ischemic stroke
attenuated the brain damage in a rat model of transient focal
cerebral ischemia.10 Unlike earlier studies, the current study is
focused on suppressing MMP-12 at an early time point, rather
than hours after reperfusion. In addition, formulation was
administered by intra-arterial route to achieve target delivery
of the formulation to ischemic brain. Despite our efforts, no
different treatment outcome was noticed between intravenous
and intra-arterial administrations. However, there is a possibility that a small dose of formulation by intra-arterial delivery could offer the same therapeutic benefit as a large dose of
intravenous formulation, which was not studied in the current
investigation. Although several research groups used adenoviral or lentiviral vectors to administer shRNA-expressing plasmids of target genes to attain the efficiency in vivo, M-12sh in
this study were administered as a nonviral, nanoparticle-based
formulation. In vitro and in vivo efficiency, as well as in vivo
efficacy, of M-12sh formulation used in this study was already
demonstrated by our group.10 In addition, we now demonstrate the in vivo efficiency and efficacy of the same formulation after intra-arterial administration. Because we recently
reported the efficiency and specificity of plasmids expressing

BBB disruption after ischemic stroke can be continuous or
occur transiently in 2 distinct phases.16–18 In experimental studies, BBB opening is biphasic; the initial breakdown is most
likely caused by oxidative stress and is followed by a partial
BBB recovery before the second phase of increased BBB permeability leads to neutrophil infiltration through TJ redistribution.19,20 An important question addressed in this study is
whether a 2-hour ischemia in rat is enough to cause BBB disruption. M-12sh formulation administered to rats at the end
of a 2-hour ischemia was able to reach the brain cells in the
ipsilateral hemisphere, caused MMP-12 gene silencing, and
thereby indicated opening of the BBB in these subjects. EBD
extravasation into the ischemic brain regions of these animals
further strengthened these results and provided rationale for

the timing of treatment instituted in the current investigation.
Based on EBD extravasation in Sprague–Dawley rats subjected to a 2-hour MCAO using an intraluminal suture, some
degree of BBB disruption occurred at 3 to 4 hours, maximal
disruption at 5 hours, and delayed disruption at 48 to 50 hours
after reperfusion.16 In the same 2-hour MCAO model, the current study demonstrated the occurrence of some degree of
BBB disruption at the end of 2-hour ischemia without reperfusion. Given the EBD staining of ischemic areas, despite the
presence of monofilament that occluded the MCA at its origin,
there must be minor collaterals supplying some blood to the
ischemic area. In any case, this experiment demonstrates that
2-hour ischemia is sufficient to deliver the administered formulation to ischemic brain cells.
The BBB is not a static barrier but tightly regulated, allowing changes in vascular permeability. TJs play a key role in the
functional preservation of the BBB.21 TJ-associated proteins

structures and regulation characteristics, play important roles
in the maintenance of structure and function of TJ. The expression of these TJ proteins directly correlates with BBB permeability and vasogenic edema.22,23 In this study, the decreased
expression of TJ proteins is noticed as early as 1 hour after
ischemia induction. As expected and discussed earlier, TJ
protein degradation is predominant in rats subjected to 1-day
reperfusion subsequent to a 1-, 2-, or 4-hour ischemia.
We hypothesize that MMP-12 by itself or by regulating
the activity of other important MMPs, such as MMP-9 and
MMP-2, could contribute to BBB disruption by degrading
≥1 extracellular matrix and TJ proteins. As expected, MMP12 suppression in this study significantly reduced the EBD
extravasation into the ischemic brain and TJ protein degradation and, thereby, protected the BBB integrity after ischemic stroke. MMP and serine protease gene families have
been shown to degrade proteins of the basal lamina around
the cerebral blood vessels.24,25 This attack on the basal lamina exposes the TJ proteins, such as claudin-5, occludin, and
ZO-1. Occludin, a regulatory protein that can alter paracellular permeability assembles with claudin-5 into heteropolymers and intramembranous strands.1,26,27 Occludin also
anchors the claudins to ZO and the plasma membranes of

been shown to degrade TJ proteins after ischemia and reperfusion.8,28,29 Reports indicate that MMPs and tPA play critical
roles in the BBB disruption during acute ischemic stroke.29,30
In the current study, MMP-12 suppression significantly
reduced the activity of MMP-9 and protein expression of tPA,
a serine protease that is well-known to contribute to BBB disruption after ischemic stroke (Figure 6). Therefore, the BBB

protection offered after MMP-12 suppression in this study
could be (1) a direct therapeutic effect of MMP-12 suppression, (2) mediated via MMP-9 and tPA, or (3) a combination
of both. Recently, it was reported that the intracellular MMP12 lead to IFN-α secretion, whereas the extracellular MMP-12
cleaved IFN-α receptor 2–binding site of systemic IFN-α.12
IFN-α is a master cytokine capable of inducing the production
of other proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1,
interleukin-2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and IFNγ. In our earlier study, MMP-12 suppression after ischemic
stroke reduced tumor necrosis factor-α protein expression
and inhibited apoptosis.10 Therefore, a possible reason for the
decrease in tumor necrosis factor-α protein expression after
MMP-12 suppression in our ischemic stroke model could be

the suppression of IFN-α release. The release of IFN-α from
MMP-12-expressing neuronal cells after cerebral ischemia
and during reperfusion could also contribute to BBB damage.
Earlier studies have consistently shown that astrocytes
are necessary for maintenance and maturation of the BBB.31
Further, astrocyte end-foot contacts have been shown to mediate regional cerebral blood flow.32 Astrocyte end-feet around
the blood vessels were clearly separated from the TJ proteins,
including claudin-5, occludin, and ZO-1 in sham-operated
rats. Cross sections of blood vessels in these animals showed
a continuous rim or line of TJ protein immunostaining in the
endothelial cell clefts. In contrast, disrupted appearance of TJ
proteins around the endothelial cells was noticed in the ischemic
hemisphere at 24 hours after reperfusion (Figure 5). In addition,

3530  Stroke  December 2015

GFAP-positive immunoreactivity in the region of the blood vessels was colocalized with degraded TJ proteins in the ischemic
hemisphere. These results are completely in agreement with the
earlier report wherein the authors clearly demonstrated colocalization of astrocytes around the blood vessels in the ischemic hemisphere with TJ proteins at 24 hours after reperfusion.8
Whether the astrocytes take up the degraded TJ proteins or synthesize them in response to the injury will require further study.
Synthesis of TJ proteins by astrocytes in response to ischemia/
reperfusion injury might occur at longer reperfusion times as
a part of neurovascular remodeling process. Therefore, in this
study, the appearance of TJ proteins in the astrocytes around the
blood vessels at 24 hours after reperfusion could be attributed to
the uptake of degraded TJ proteins by astrocytes. As expected,
MMP-12 suppression after ischemia prevented TJ protein degradation and diminished the appearance of TJ proteins in astrocytes around the blood vessels.
To summarize, this study clearly demonstrates the pathological role of MMP-12 in causing the BBB disruption after
ischemia and reperfusion. Although we could test only a single dose of M-12sh formulation, the tested dose was effective
in demonstrating the early brain damage caused by MMP-12
after focal cerebral ischemia. Considering the multiphasic
roles played by MMPs, further investigations are warranted
to determine whether the long-term suppression of MMP-12
after ischemic stroke is beneficial.

SUPPLEMENTAL METHODS
Animals and experimental design
Young adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were used in this study. A total of 137 rats weighing
200–240 g were procured from Harlan Laboratories and maintained in a specific pathogen free
Laboratory Animal Care Facility of University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria. Animals
were housed in a 12-h light/dark cycle at a controlled temperature and humidity with free access
to food and water. After the animals reached a weight of 260±5 g, they were assigned to nine
groups as described in Supplemental Table 1. Based on the literature and after considering 1020% mortality associated with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) procedure, we needed
these numbers of animals to obtain data from at least six animals for each experiment and attain
a proper statistical analysis. Animals that did not show post-stroke symptoms after MCAO
procedure were excluded from the study. Animals that showed post-stroke symptoms after
MCAO procedure were randomly allocated to groups 2 to 9.
Antibodies
Anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was obtained from Dakocytomation (Carpinteria,
CA). Anti-MMP-12, anti-claudin-5, anti-occludin, anti-ZO-1, and anti-GFAP were obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). Anti-claudin-5, anti-occludin, and anti-ZO-1 were
also obtained from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Anti-tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
and anti-MMP-3, Iba1 and RECA-1 were obtained from abcam (Cambridge, MA). Anti-NeuN
antibody was obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody was obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO).
Synthesis of shRNA expressing plasmids
We designed, constructed, and synthesized rat MMP-12 shRNA (M-12sh) plasmid by using
pSilencer™ 4.1-CMV neo vector. The resultant vectors inserted with shRNAs were transformed
into chemically competent E. coli cells (JM109 competent cells) and cultured overnight. M-12sh
expressing plasmids were synthesized from the overnight bacterial culture by using QIAGEN
plasmid mini/maxi kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Positive clones were confirmed
by gene sequencing analysis.
Formulation preparation and administration
MMP-12 shRNA expressing plasmids were formulated as nanoparticles, which are sufficiently
small to diffuse into the tissues and enter the cells by endocytosis. M-12sh expressing plasmids,
synthesized by using QIAGEN plasmid maxi kit, were further purified by phenol-chloroform
extraction procedure. In vivo-JetPEI, obtained from Polyplus transfection (Illkirch, France)
contains a cationic polymer that efficiently condenses plasmid DNA. M-12sh expressing
plasmids were formulated with in vivo-JetPEI and sterile water for injection using aseptic
conditions according to the manufacturer’s instructions. M-12sh formulation was administered at
a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight to designated groups of rats by either intravenously (IV) or intraarterially (IA). In case of IV administration, formulation was slowly injected via tail vein at the
end of the MCAO procedure, i.e., after reestablishing the blood flow to the ischemic brain. In
case of IA administration, formulation was slowly injected directly into the ischemic brain via a
micro catheter which was introduced into the right internal carotid artery after removal of the
monofilament.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Samples were subjected to forty cycles at 95°C for fifteen seconds and 60°C for one min in
iCycler IQ (Multi Color Real-Time PCR Detection System, Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA). Data
were collected and recorded using the iCycler IQ software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA) and
expressed as a function of the threshold cycle (Ct), which represents the number of cycles at
which the fluorescent intensity of the Sybr Green dye is significantly above than that of the
background fluorescence. The housekeeping gene, β-actin was used for normalization of MMP12 expression. Average Ct values were normalized with average Ct values of β-actin. After
normalization of the Ct values, fold differences were calculated by using the formula 2^-(ΔCt of
Test) / 2^-(ΔCt of controls).
Immunoblot analysis
In order to study the expression of various proteins in the ischemic brain tissues of sham,
untreated and treated MCAO subjected rats with/without reperfusion; immunoblot analysis was
performed. Briefly, ipsilateral brain hemispheres of rats from various groups were suspended in
0.2 mL of homogenization buffer, homogenized using a Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products, Inc.),
and followed by sonication. Tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 30 min at 4°C,
and the protein levels in the supernatant were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce,
Rockford, IL). Samples [equal amount (30-50 μg) of total protein/well] were subjected to 8-14%
SDS-PAGE based on the specifications of the protein, and the protein bands on the gel were
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were processed with primary
antibodies followed by appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive
bands were visualized using chemiluminescence ECL Western blotting detection reagents on
Hyperfilm-MP autoradiography film (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). Immunoblots were re-probed
and processed with GAPDH antibody and the measurements were normalized to loading
controls.
Immunofluorescence analysis
Paraffin-embedded brain sections of various groups of animals were subjected to
immunofluorescence analysis. Briefly, paraffin-embedded rat coronal brain sections were deparaffinized, subjected to antigen retrieval, permeabilized, and processed with primary antibody.
The sections were then washed in PBS and incubated with the appropriate fluorescent-labeled
secondary antibodies, counterstained with DAPI, cover slipped, and observed using a confocal
microscope (Olympus Fluoview). Negative controls (without primary antibody or using isotype
specific IgG) were maintained for all the samples. Immunofluorescence analysis was also
performed to identify the colocalization of astrocytes and endothelial cells with the tight junction
proteins such as claudin-5, occludin and ZO-1 as well as MMP-12 with neurons and microglia.
EBD extravasation
Briefly, EBD (2% in saline, ~4ml/kg) was injected over two min into the tail vein and allowed to
circulate for 60 min. After intravenous administration, EBD binds rapidly to serum albumin and
its extravasation indicates the passage of albumin through the BBB into the parenchyma. Rats
were deeply anaesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with PBS followed by
10% buffered formalin. Rats were decapitated and brains were removed rapidly and placed in an
adult rat brain matrix (Kent Scientific Corporation). Brains were then sliced into 2-mm-thick

3

coronal sections. EBD leaked area and hemisphere area of each section was traced and measured
with National Institute of Health Image J software (version 1.46b). BBB disruption was
quantified by using the formula: EBD extravasation (%) = {(volume of contralateral hemisphere)
– (volume of EBD unstained ischemic hemisphere)} / volume of contralateral hemisphere. This
formula accounts for the possible interference of brain edema.
Gelatin Zymography
Tissue lysates obtained from the ischemic brains of various groups of animals as well as the
respective brain tissue of sham group animals with equal amounts of protein were subjected to
10% polyacrylamide gels that were co-polymerized with substrate (2 mg/mL gelatin) at 4°C. The
proteins were renatured by washing the gel twice (each time for 30 min) with 2.5% Triton X-100
and then incubated in substrate buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.6) for 48 h at 37 °C.
After a rinse in water, the gel was stained with amido black and destained for appropriate color
contrast.
