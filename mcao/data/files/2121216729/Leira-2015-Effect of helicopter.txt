Background Patients often suffer a stroke at a significant distance from a center capable of delivering endovascular
therapy, thus requiring rapid transport by helicopter emergency medical services while receiving a recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator infusion that was initiated locally. But
little is known about how a helicopter flight may impact the
safety and efficacy of recombinant tissue plasminogen
activator-induced reperfusion and patient outcomes.
Aim To establish a new animal method to address with fidelity
the safety and overall effect of helicopter emergency medical
services during thrombolysis.
Methods Prospective randomized open blinded end-point
study of an actual helicopter flight exposure. Adult C57BL/6
male mice were treated with a 10 mg/kg recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator infusion two-hours after an embolic
middle cerebral artery occlusion. Mice were randomized in
pairs to simultaneously receive the infusion during a local
helicopter flight or in a ground hangar.
Results Eighteen mice (nine pairs) were analyzed. The paired
t-test analysis showed nonsignificant smaller infarction
volumes in the helicopter-assigned animals (mean pair difference 33 mm3, P = 0·33). The amount of hemorrhagic transformation between the helicopter and ground groups was 4·08
vs. 4·56 μl, respectively (paired t-test, P = 0·45).
Conclusions This study shows that helicopter emergency
medical services do not have an inherent adverse effect
on outcome in a mouse model of ischemic stroke with

Introduction
Stroke is an emergency that affects approximately 800 000 Americans each year (1). Because many patients suffer a stroke at a
significant distance from a specialized stroke unit capable of
delivering endovascular therapy (2), they often require rapid
transport by helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS)
while receiving a recombinant tissue plasminogen activator
(rtPA) infusion that was initiated at a local hospital (drip & ship)
(3,4). Despite the growing importance of HEMS in acute stroke
care, little is known about how a helicopter flight may impact the
safety and potential efficacy of rtPA-induced reperfusion and
patient outcomes. A helicopter flight is a unique environment
characterized by physical factors such as vibration (5), noise (6),
accelerations (7), and rapid changes in barometric pressure and
partial pressure of oxygen (8), all of which may potentially affect
arterial clot constitution and lysis, reperfusion, and other aspects
of neurophysiologic response to ischemic stroke. While some of
these factors may be potentially harmful, others may be beneficial.
Understanding the overall helicopter effect might improve the
care of patients by allowing the safe delivery of interventions
during flight (9). Prospective studies in humans are difficult
because the complex helicopter flight environment is difficult to
reproduce in a clinical setting, and randomization to an actual
helicopter exposure might be problematic. Retrospective studies
are feasible but limited by selection biases. The objective of this
study was to overcome these methodological barriers by establishing a new animal model to experimentally address the safety
and overall efficacy of HEMS during thrombolysis.

Methods
We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-blinded endpoint (PROBE) pilot study that combined a controlled mouse
ischemia model with an actual helicopter flight exposure. The
study was named Assessing the Impact of Rotorcrafts in a Model of
Induced Cerebral Embolism (AIR-MICE), and was conducted at
the University of Iowa Colleges of Medicine and Engineering
between May 2013 and July 2014. All experimental procedures

were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. This study involved tight coordination
between the laboratory and flying teams in order to consistently
achieve arterial occlusion two-hours before flight time. Once
careful flight planning determined that the scheduled mission was
a ‘go’, the animal team received notification by text page from the
flying team to initiate surgery.
Embolic middle cerebral artery occlusions
(eMCAO) procedures
Paired adult C57BL/6 male mice underwent simultaneous twohour eMCAO procedures according to the method described by
Overgaard et al. with slight modification (10). Briefly, arterial
blood from a wild-type mouse donor was supplemented with
human fibrinogen (2 mg/ml) and immediately clotted in a PE-10
tube for four-hours at room temperature, followed by storage at
4°C overnight. The clot (∼5 cm) was washed and then incubated
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for three
to four-hours and was transferred to a modified PE-10 catheter.
Animals were anesthetized with 1–1.5% isoflurane during the
surgery. The catheter containing a single fibrin-rich clot was then
introduced into the external carotid artery and advanced to the
internal carotid artery. The catheter was removed immediately
after embolization, and the arterial wound was secured to prevent
blood loss. Laser Doppler flow monitoring (Perimed Instruments,
Stockholm, Sweden) was used to confirm induction of ischemia
after surgical closing of the wound. The mice body temperature
was maintained at 37 ± 1°C during the entire procedure. The
engineering flight team was paged with the exact the time of
arterial occlusion so that the helicopter flight lift-off time could be
adjusted to exactly two-hours later to avoid introducing bias
regarding timing of initiation of treatment, a strong predictor of
outcome.

Transport to engineering research hangar and
randomization
Thirty minutes before take-off time, each mouse was placed in an
identical specifically designed 0·6 mm thick acrylic Plexiglas boxes
(48·5 × 20·5 × 34·6 cm) (Fig. 1). Veterinarians from the animal
facility provided input in the design of these boxes to ensure animal
welfare. These two boxes had handles for convenient transportation, and contained all the necessary elements for the eMCAOreperfusion experiment including IV pumps, electrical sockets,
food, and fan. The mice were placed inside a conical tube restrainer
that was secured to the floor of the box to protect against injury
from turbulence with no specific insulation for noise, vibration, or
temperature (Fig. 1). Each pair of mice was transported in their
own boxes to the Operator Performance Laboratory (OPL) Engineering Research hangar located at Iowa City Municipal Airport
(KIOW), 2 miles from the laboratory. Transport was performed in
a ground vehicle previously certified by the animal care facility.
Mice were randomized (1:1) to either a one-hour local helicopter
flight, or to remain in the hangar (ground).
Helicopter flight vs. ground
The intervention consisted of a one-hour local flight in the Iowa
City area while receiving rtPA in an Mi2 Helicopter (Fig. 1). The
Mi2 is a soviet-era military dual turbine (298 kW, 400 sHP) helicopter for military transport (8 passengers, 2 crew) and HEMS,
which has been adapted for airborne research. The aft (rear) crew
compartment has been modified with a rail structure to accept
floor-mounted instrumentation racks to secure the mice box, and
DC-AC converters provide 120 Volts to power the animal IV
pumps while the in-flight investigator monitors the animals
(Fig. 1). Further specifications about the Mi2 are available at
https://hfdata.opl.uiowa.edu/opl/?q=mi2. Flights were initiated at
two-hours after eMCAO. The airborne investigator turned on the

IV pump infusion, and simultaneously texted the co-investigator
assigned to monitor the ground-assigned animal to do the same.
In this way, mice in the helicopter or on the ground received the
10 mg/kg infusion of rtPA simultaneously for 45 min. All flights
were consistent in regard to altitude reached, distance, and degree
of maneuvering. Outside temperature and atmospheric pressure
were recorded from the KIOW automated weather observation
system before takeoff.
Transport back to the animal facility and blinding
After the one-hour flight, both animals were transported back to
the animal facility by the same ground vehicle. Because a helicopter flight is an intervention that cannot be blinded, we used a
PROBE methodology. Upon return to the laboratory, the investigators involved in the transport to and from the airport randomly
assigned the pair of mice-coded boxes without the presence of the
investigator who measured the outcomes. Randomization codes
were kept sealed until the end of the experiment by a research
coordinator.
Blinded outcome analyses
Prior to sacrifice at 24 h, mice were assessed for neurological
function. The neurological deficit was scored on as follows: 0, no
observable neurological deficit (normal); 1, failure to extend left
forepaw on lifting the whole body by tail (mild); 2, circling to the
contralateral side but normal posture at rest (moderate); 3,
leaning to the contralateral side at rest (severe); 4, no spontaneous
motor activity (11). Mice were euthanized and decapitated. Brains
were extracted and dissected and sliced in eight 1-mm coronal
sections using a Brain Matrix (Roboz Surgical Instruments,
Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Infarction volume was quantified with
the use of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, SigmaAldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) staining, digital photography, and
analyzed using image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) (12).
Hemorrhagic volume was then assessed with a spectrophotometric hemoglobin assay 24 h after stroke (13). Hemorrhage volumes
were calculated from the linear relationship between optical
density of homogenized hemispheric brain tissue and hemoglobin concentration and presented as hemorrhage volume (μl).
A paired t-test and Wilcoxon analyses were used to compare
volumes of infarction and hemorrhage between each pair of

mice with a significance level of 0·05. We performed a general
lineal model between paired infarct volume, atmospheric pressure, and outside temperature to determine the influence of those
physical variables on infarct size between missions. Data were
kept sealed and not analyzed until the full completion of the
experiment.
Sample size considerations
In this exploratory study, sample size was constrained by the high
cost of helicopter flight missions. Our power analysis predicted
that 10 paired missions (20 animals) would serve to detect a
50 mm3 difference between groups (assuming a standard deviation of 40 mm3) with an alpha of 0·05 and 80% power. All statistical analyses were completed with SAS version 9·4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).

Results
Figure 2 shows a CONSORT-style study diagram. Twenty mice
(10 mission pairs) were initially included. One mouse in the
ground group died before the 24 h assessment due to surgeryrelated expected mortality. In this case, data from the other mouse
in the pair were disregarded due to the absence of a comparison.
Thus, 18 mice (9 mission pairs) were analyzed. The paired analysis
showed nonsignificant smaller infarction volumes in the
helicopter-assigned animals (mean pair difference 33 mm3, paired
t-test P = 0·33, Wilcoxon P = 0·35). Table 1 shows the differences
between infarct volume and hemoglobin content (ground vs. helicopter). The mean infarction volumes at 24 h were 246·6 mm3
(SD 154) for the ground group, and 213·6 mm3 (SD 170) for the
helicopter group. The general linear model showed that barometric pressure (P = 0·007), but not temperature (P = 0·46),
explained in part the variability in infarct volume observed
between different missions. We repeated this analysis with 10
pairs after giving the missing subject an imputed value of the
mean volume for the ground group, and the results were similar
(246·6 vs. 211 mm3, P = 0·25). A retrospective power calculation
based on these results estimated that we actually had a 39%
power, and that 25 pairs (n = 50) would be needed to show a
significant difference with a power of 80% and an alpha of 0·05.

The mean hemorrhagic volumes were 4·56 (SD 2·05) for the
ground group and 4·08 (SD 1·17) for the helicopter group. The
paired analysis showed a nonsignificant reduction of hemorrhagic transformation in the helicopter-assigned animals (pairedtest P = 0·45, Wilcoxon P = 0·46). Neurologic scores were similar
in both ground and helicopter groups (1·28 vs. 1·22, P = 0·86).

Discussion
This project addresses an important issue in acute stroke care: the
lack of an experimental system with which to critically expand
our knowledge regarding the effect of helicopter transportation
on acute stroke and rtPA treatment. HEMS is an important
element in the system for delivering acute stroke care for patients
that suffer a stroke at a significant distance from a stroke center,
which comprises some 20% of the US population (14,15) and
many other areas of the world. HEMS has been crucial for delivering rtPA while in route to a tertiary center (3) (4), and its use is

expected to increase with the establishment of urgent endovascular rescue therapy (16) as a the new standard of care (2). In this
new context, HEMS present an untapped opportunity to initiate
acute stroke trials and deliver experimental neuroprotective
medications that can expand the time window for reperfusion in
route (9). But despite its obvious relevance, little is known about
the effect of the unusual physical factors present in this environment (7) on stroke patients.
Some of these factors could be potentially harmful for the
ischemic brain. For example, the hypobaric environment could
worsen the ischemic penumbra, or acceleration in three axes
might result in nausea and vomiting that transiently but critically
could increase intracranial pressure. The extreme noise might
result in increased blood pressure and reperfusion injury. In
addition, vibration might increase blood–brain barrier permeability (17). On the other hand, some of these factors might be
helpful. For example, accelerations and low frequency vibrations
(18) might be synergistic with thrombolysis, and thus enhance the

therapeutic efficacy of rtPA. It is therefore crucial to understand
the net effect and interaction of physical factors during helicopter
flights in order to optimize the delivery and protective efficacy of
thrombolytic agents, combined with eventual neuroprotective
agents, for stroke patients.
We have shown that the administration of rtPA during helicopter transportation appears to be safe in an eMCAO model without
increase in hemorrhagic transformation. We are aware of the
importance of scaling when judging animal studies (19). The
helicopter used in this study was human size, and therefore the
physical factors present might have been disproportionally
intense for a mouse (20). But despite this concern, we did not
observe any tendency toward worse outcomes in the helicopterassigned mice. These findings are consistent with the safety of
HEMS endorsed by previous human observations (21,22),
although these studies where limited by their retrospective nature
and the potential for selection biases based on stroke severity and
distance. We judge our findings reassuring from the point of
safety, and endorse the common and growing practice of ‘drip and
ship’ by HEMS in stroke patients.
We are intrigued by the tendency toward smaller infarctions in
the helicopter-assigned animals. The difference did not achieve a
statistical significance in this small sample with the observed variability in infarction size of this eMCAO model. However, the
direction of this tendency was consistent with the other outcomes, all showing a tendency for better results in the animals
exposed to helicopter transport. This would be consistent with
our previous anecdotal observation that stroke patients in whom
rtPA was initiated at a local hospital often report sudden improvement during the helicopter flight itself. There is a plausible
mechanism to explain a synergistic effect with reperfusion. Published data suggests that low frequency (50 Hz) vibrations, a
prominent component of helicopter flight frequency vibration
(5), may potentiate clot lysis (23). Indeed, another physical factor
(ultrasound) is also known to promote thrombolysis and potentially enhance treatment for stroke (24). The limitations of this
work include the mentioned issues of human scaling, and the
variability of infarction size inherent to the eMCAO, which
requires a larger sample size to demonstrate effects. Another limitation is that we lack a data collection of all the potential physical
factors involved through sensors. The strength of this study is the
randomized paired methodology and the use of a real helicopter
exposure while receiving rtPA, which facilitates generalization of
this experiment to patient settings.

Summary/conclusions
In summary, from this work we conclude that randomized trials
of the effect of helicopter transport and rtPA in a rodent model of
eMCAO are feasible with our experimental system. This experimental approach is desirable to adequately test the interaction of
helicopter flight factors with neuroprotective agents. The issue of
the potential beneficial effect of HEMS, including the influence of
each individual physical factor, such as low frequency vibration
and acceleration on stroke outcomes, needs to be studied further.
Our work provides the rational basis for a sample size calcula© 2015 World Stroke Organization

tion. The next step would be to isolate the individual helicopter
factors in order to distinguish the beneficial factors from the
deleterious ones, and then to replicate the beneficial factors
through physical interventions. This could lead to a new paradigm of treatment in which beneficial helicopter physical factors
are recapitulated on the ground, or by contrast deleterious helicopter factors are mitigated during flight, in order to improve
patient outcomes.
