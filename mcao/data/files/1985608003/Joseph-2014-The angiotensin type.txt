Evidence indicates that angiotensin II type 2 receptors (AT2R) exert cerebroprotective actions during
stroke. A selective non-peptide AT2R agonist, Compound 21 (C21), has been shown to exert beneﬁcial
effects in models of cardiac and renal disease, as well as hemorrhagic stroke. Here, we hypothesize that
C21 may exert beneﬁcial effects against cerebral damage and neurological deﬁcits produced by ischemic
stroke. We determined the effects of central and peripheral administration of C21 on the cerebral
damage and neurological deﬁcits in rats elicited by endothelin-1 induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), a model of cerebral ischemia. Rats infused centrally (intracerebroventricular) with C21
before endothelin-1 induced MCAO exhibited signiﬁcant reductions in cerebral infarct size and the
neurological deﬁcits produced by cerebral ischemia. Similar cerebroprotection was obtained in rats
injected systemically (intraperitoneal) with C21 either before or after endothelin-1 induced MCAO. The
protective effects of C21 were reversed by central administration of an AT2R inhibitor, PD123319. While
C21 did not alter cerebral blood ﬂow at the doses used here, peripheral post-stroke administration of this
agent signiﬁcantly attenuated the MCAO-induced increases in inducible nitric oxide synthase, chemokine
(C-C) motif ligand 2 and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 mRNAs in the cerebral cortex, indicating that the
cerebroprotective action is associated with an anti-inﬂammatory effect. These results strengthen the
view that AT2R agonists may have potential therapeutic value in ischemic stroke, and provide the ﬁrst
evidence of cerebroprotection induced by systemic post stroke administration of a selective AT2R
agonist.

1. Introduction
The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) encompasses multiple
pathways involved in the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular disease, and RAS pathways are promising targets for both acute and
preventative therapies (Ferreira et al., 2010). Initially, experiments
on the cerebroprotective potential of RAS pathways focused on
inhibiting the angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) using
AT1R antagonists (ARBs) (Lu et al., 2005). More recently, studies

suggest that Ang II type 2 receptors (AT2R) exert a protective effect
during ischemic stroke. Tissue levels of AT2R are increased in the
peri-infarct region of the brain following ischemic injury (Li et al.,
2005; Makino et al., 1996), and Ang II-induced activation of
neuronal AT2R elicited differentiation and regeneration (Cote et al.,
1999; Reinecke et al., 2003). Thus, it was hypothesized that the
increased expression of AT2R within the peri-infarct region could,
in the presence of ARBs to block AT1R, be activated by the raised
endogenous levels of Ang II and serve a neuroprotective role (Li
et al., 2005). Data from this and other studies support this idea by
demonstrating that the beneﬁcial action of ARBs after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced cerebral ischemia is prevented by speciﬁc AT2R blockers (Faure et al., 2008; Li et al., 2005).
Further support for the cerebroprotective potential of AT2R agonism comes from data indicating that MCAO produces greater

J.P. Joseph et al. / Neuropharmacology 81 (2014) 134e141

ischemic brain damage in AT2R knockout mice compared with
wild-type controls, and that AT1R blockade was more effective at
reducing ischemic damage and neurological deﬁcits in wild type
mice compared with mice lacking AT2R (Iwai et al., 2004). Finally,
direct evidence for AT2R mediated cerebroprotection was obtained
from studies which demonstrated that central treatment with the
peptide AT2R agonist CGP42112 pre- or post stroke reduced cortical
infarct volume and behavioral deﬁcits following endothelin-1 (ET1) induced MCAO, effects that were inhibited by the AT2R antagonist, PD123319 (McCarthy et al., 2009, 2012).
The development of a speciﬁc non-peptide AT2R agonist, Compound 21 (C21), has made the AT2R a potential therapeutic target for
cardiovascular diseases (Steckelings et al., 2011; Carey, 2013). C21 has
already been shown to reduce vascular injury and myocardial ﬁbrosis,
and renal inﬂammation and survival, in stroke-prone spontaneously
hypertensive rats (Gelosa et al., 2009; Rehman et al., 2012), as well as
renal inﬂammatory responses in a rat model of renovascular hypertension (Matavelli et al., 2011). Additionally, C21 treatment prevents
renal inﬂammation in renovascular hypertension and in prehypertensive obese Zucker rats via induction of interleukin-10
(Dhande et al., 2013). In the current study we assessed the potential
cerebroprotective actions of central or peripheral administration of
C21 against ischemic stroke produced by ET-1 induced MCAO.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and ethical approval
Male Sprague Dawley rats (8 weeks old; 250e275 g), purchased from Charles
River Farms (Wilmington, MA), were used in this study. All experimental procedures
were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. In addition, these studies were conducted in accordance with the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Academy of
Sciences (eighth ed., 2011). Rats had ad libitum access to water and standard rat
chow and were housed in a well-ventilated, speciﬁc pathogen-free, temperaturecontrolled environment (24  1  C; 12 he12 h lightedark cycle).
2.2. Anesthesia, analgesia and euthanasia
For surgical procedures, anesthesia was induced using 100% O2/4% isoﬂurane,
and was maintained throughout the surgeries by the administration of 100% O2/2%
isoﬂurane. During the surgeries/procedures, the level of anesthesia was monitored
by checking the eye blink reﬂex and a reaction to paw pinch, and was adjusted if
necessary. Buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, s.c., Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA) was
administered to rats immediately following the survival surgeries. Animals were
euthanized by placing them under deep anesthesia with 100% O2/5% isoﬂurane,
followed by decapitation.
2.3. Implantation of intracranial cannulae
After a 7 day acclimation period, rats were anesthetized as above placed in a
Kopf stereotaxic frame. They were implanted with a 21 gauge stainless steel guide
cannula into the right cerebral hemisphere (1.6 mm anterior and 5.2 mm lateral to
bregma), as detailed previously (Regenhardt et al., 2013). This cannula was utilized,
seven days after implantation, for injection of either ET-1 (3 ml of 80 mM solution;
1 ml/min) to induce MCAO or control solution (0.9% saline) for the sham MCAO rats
(Mecca et al., 2011). In certain experiments rats underwent a second surgery
immediately following implantation of the guide cannula. This surgery involved
implantation of a stainless steel cannula (kit 1; ALZET, Cupertino, CA, USA) into the
left lateral cerebroventricle (1.3 mm posterior and 1.5 mm lateral to bregma, 4.5 mm
below the surface of the cranium) as detailed previously (Mecca et al., 2011). This
cannula was coupled via vinyl tubing to a 2 week osmotic pump (model 2002;
ALZET, Cupertino, CA) (Mecca et al., 2011). In these animals, osmotic pumps were
implanted subcutaneously between the scapulae and were used to infuse either C21,
PD123319 or control solution [artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (aCSF)] via the intracerebroventricular (ICV) route starting at the time of cannula placement and lasting
until the animals were euthanized. Body temperature and the level of anesthesia
were monitored throughout these surgical procedures.
2.4. Measurement of cerebral blood ﬂow
Laser Doppler ﬂowmetry was used to measure cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) as
detailed previously (Mecca et al., 2011). In brief, rats were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and placed in a Kopf stereotaxic frame as described above. CBF measurements were performed using a Standard Pencil Probe and Blood Flow Meter coupled
to a Powerlab 4/30 with LabChart 7 (ADInstruments, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO,

135

USA). The probe was secured to the skull surface with a plastic holder placed just
posterior to the MCA guide cannula.
2.5. Experimental protocols
Experiment 1: The aim of this experiment was to determine whether centrally
applied C21 exerted protective effects during ischemic stroke. Rats were infused ICV
with C21 (0.0075 mg/ml//h) or 1 ml of aCSF for 7 days, and then underwent ET-1
induced MCAO. After 3 more days of ICV C21 or aCSF infusion, rats underwent
neurological testing, and were then euthanized to assess cerebral infarct volume.
Since C21 has a half-life of w4 h in rats (Wan et al., 2004), it was infused centrally
before and after stroke in order to elicit a constant level of drug in the CNS during the
insult. The dose of C21 infused ICV in this experiment was based on a previous study
in which ICV infusion of a higher dose of C21 (0.5 mg/ml//h) elicited AT2R speciﬁc
effects (Gao et al., 2011). Since the ICV dose of C21 used in our study is lower, we do
not expect AT1R activity.
Experiment 2: The aim of this experiment was to determine whether C21 applied
systemically before and after the insult exerted protective effects against ischemic
stroke. Rats were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with either C21 (0.03 mg/kg or
0.1 mg/kg) or control solution (0.9% sterile saline). Two hours later, rats underwent
ET-1 induced MCAO. At 4, 24 and 48 h following MCAO, rats received further IP
injections of C21 (0.03 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline. At 3 days post-MCAO rats
underwent neurological testing, and were then euthanized to assess cerebral infarct
volume. The doses of C21 injected IP in this and subsequent experiments were based
on doses of C21 (0.03e0.3 mg/kg) used in previously published studies that elicited
effects blocked by the AT2R antagonist PD123319 (Bosnyak et al., 2010; Gelosa et al.,
2009; Wan et al., 2004). In addition, pharmacokinetic data provided by Vicore
Pharma (Göteborg, Sweden; suppliers of C21) indicate that intravenous injection of
0.03 mg/kg C21 (the primary dose used in our study) results in a peak plasma
concentration of approximately 0.1 mM C21. The Ki of C21 for the AT1R is >10 mM
(Bosnyak et al., 2011; Wan et al., 2004), meaning that when plasma peak concentrations of C21 are well below 1 mM there will not be a stimulation of AT1R. Based on
this, and since it can be assumed that plasma concentrations of C21 obtained after IP
injection will be lower than after intravenous injection, we expected that any effects
produced by IP administered 0.03 mg/kg C21 would be AT2R-mediated.
Experiment 3: The aim of this experiment was to determine if C21, applied systemically at a dose that elicited cerebroprotection, altered blood pressure. Rats were
administered a single IP injection of C21 (0.03 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline, followed 30 min
later by mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) measurement via an occlusion tail-cuff.
Experiment 4: The aims of this experiment were twofold: to determine if C21,
applied systemically at a dose that elicited cerebroprotection, altered (1) baseline CBF
and (2) the decrease in CBF produced by ET-1 induced MCAO. (1) Rats were administered a single IP injection of C21 (0.03 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline, followed by analysis of
CBF for 60 min; (2) administered a single IP injection of C21 (0.03 mg/kg) or 0.9%
saline 2 h prior to ET-1 induced MCAO, as in Experiment 2. CBF was monitored
starting 5 min before ET-1 induced MCAO and continued until 4 h post ET-1 injection.
Experiment 5: The aim of this experiment was to determine whether C21 applied
systemically only after the MCAO insult exerted protective effects against ischemic
stroke. This protocol was similar to Experiment 2, with two exceptions: rats were not
administered the pre-MCAO IP injection of C21 or 0.9% saline, and only one dose of
C21 (0.03 mg/kg) was used.
Experiment 6: The aim of this experiment was to determine whether the cerebroprotective action of C21 applied systemically after the insult was mediated by
central AT2R. Rats were infused ICV with PD123319 (0.3 mg/ml/h) or aCSF for 7 days
prior to and 3 days following ET-1 induced MCAO. C21 (0.03 mg/kg, IP) was
administered at 4, 24 and 48 h post-MCAO. At 3 days post-MCAO rats underwent
neurological testing, and were then euthanized to assess cerebral infarct volume.
Since PD123319 has a very short half-life (w20 min) in rats (Levy et al., 1996), it was
infused centrally before and after ET-1 induced MCAO and C21 application.
Experiment 7: The aim of this experiment was to investigate whether the cerebroprotective action of systemically applied C21 was associated with changes in inﬂammatory gene expression in the brain. Rats underwent ET-1 induced MCAO or a
sham MCAO, followed 4 and 12 h later with IP injections of either C21 (0.03 mg/kg) or
0.9% saline. Twenty-four hours post MCAO or sham MCAO, one group of rats underwent neurological testing, followed by euthanization to assess cerebral infarct volume.
Another group of rats, treated with C21 in identical fashion, were euthanized at 24 h
post-stroke, brains removed and processed for analysis of gene expression in cerebral
cortex ipsilateral to the MCAO. Initial studies demonstrated that analysis of gene
expression in the cerebral cortex at 48 h or later time points after stroke was unreliable.
Further, in associated studies we have demonstrated that the cerebroprotective actions of Ang-(1-7) are associated with potent anti-inﬂammatory actions at 24 h post
stroke (Mecca et al., 2011; Regenhardt et al., 2013). Hence our choice of 24 h for gene
expression analyses in these studies. This necessitated an alteration in the post-stroke
C21 treatment protocol (4 and 12 h instead of 4, 24 and 48 h).
2.6. Neurological testing
Neurological testing was performed 24 or 72 h post ET-1 induced MCAO,
depending on the Experiment, using the Bederson (perfect score ¼ 0) and Garcia
(perfect score ¼ 18) exams, which cumulatively evaluate spontaneous activity,

136

symmetry in limb movement, forepaw outstretching, climbing, body proprioception, response to vibrissae touch, resistance to lateral push and circling behavior
(Bederson et al., 1986; Garcia et al., 1995). Investigators who were blinded to the
treatment performed all neurological exams on rats.
2.7. Intracerebral infarct size
Cerebral infarct size was assessed by staining a single 2 mm coronal brain section from each rat with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; 0.05%) for 30 min
at 37  C as detailed previously (Mecca et al., 2011). This 2 mm coronal brain section
was w1 mm rostral and w1 mm caudal to the optic chiasm. Tissue ipsilateral to the
occlusion, which was not stained, was assumed to be infarcted. After ﬁxation with
10% formalin, brain sections were scanned on a ﬂatbed scanner (Canon) and
analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH). Using this single 2 mm brain section, the
stained (un-infarcted) cross-sectional area of the contralateral (left) hemisphere was
used to calculate, in the same slice, the infarct size (unstained tissue) within the
hemisphere ipsilateral to the ET-1 induced MCAO. To compensate for the effect of
brain edema, the corrected infarct volume was calculated using an indirect method
(Kagiyama et al., 2004; Lin et al., 1993). Cerebral infarct measurements were performed by individuals who were blinded as to the treatment groups.
Note that we chose to perform analyses of cerebral infarcts on single brain
sections as the infarct size obtained from this analysis at 72 h following ET-1 induced
MCAO (45.11  7.2%; n ¼ 5 rats) was not signiﬁcantly different from that obtained
when making assessments using ﬁve 2 mm coronal brain slices (1 rostral and 3
caudal to the above-described single slice) from the same rats (average 43.89  4.8%;
n ¼ 5 rats). Similarly, there was no difference in the cerebral infarct sizes obtained
from analysis of a single brain slice (22.29  8.4%; n ¼ 3 rats) or ﬁve 2 mm brain
slices (20.45  7.4%; n ¼ 3 rats) from C21-treated rats (0.03 mg/kg IP; administered
IP using the protocol described in Experiment 5, above).
2.8. mRNA analyses
Cluster of differentiation 11b (CD11b), glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP),
myeloperoxidase (MPO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelial nitric
oxide synthase (eNOS), chemokine (C-C) motif ligand 2 (CCL2), C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2), interleukin-1a (IL-1a), interleukin-1b (IL-1b), and interleukin6 (IL-6) mRNA were analyzed via real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) in a
StepOnePlusÔ Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as
detailed previously (Regenhardt et al., 2013). Oligonucleotide primers and Taqman
probes speciﬁc for the above genes were obtained from Applied Biosystems. Data
were normalized to GAPDH mRNA.

produced a signiﬁcant decrease in the cerebral infarct size
(measured 72 h following ET-1 application) when compared with
control (aCSF infused) rats (Fig. 1). Central pre-treatment with C21
also attenuated the neurological deﬁcits attributable to ET-1
induced MCAO, as evidenced by signiﬁcant improvements in the
Bederson and Garcia exam scores when compared with the control
rats (Fig. 1). Our previous experiments have shown that rats
receiving a sham MCAO (0.9% saline instead of ET-1) have no
discernable infarcts or neurological deﬁcits (Mecca et al., 2011;
Regenhardt et al., 2013).
3.2. Systemic pre- and post-stroke treatment with C21 reduces the
neurological deﬁcits and cerebral injury produced by ET-1 induced
MCAO
IP injection of C21 (0.03 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg) into rats pre- (2 h)
and post- (4, 24 and 48 h) ET-1 induced MCAO as described in
Experiment 2 in the Methods signiﬁcantly decreased the cerebral
infarct size and neurological deﬁcits (as measured by the Bederson
examination) when compared with control (0.9% saline injected)
rats (Fig. 2). A similar although non-signiﬁcant beneﬁcial trend was
identiﬁed using the Garcia examination (Fig. 2). Since 0.1 mg/kg
C21 exerted no greater cerebroprotective action than 0.03 mg/kg
C21, the lower dose of this drug was used in all subsequent experiments. We also demonstrated, as per Experiments 3 and 4
(Methods), that IP injection of 0.03 mg/kg C21 did not alter baseline
MAP or CBF (Fig. 3A, B). In a further set of rats, C21 (0.03 mg/kg) was
injected via the IP route 2 h prior to ET-1 induced MCAO and CBF
was measured 5 min before and for 4 h after stroke, as described in
Experiment 4 (Methods). The data in Fig. 3C demonstrate that C21
did not alter the ET-1 induced reduction in CBF or the recovery
towards baseline over the next 4 h. Importantly, this suggests that

2.9. Chemicals
C21 was a generous gift from Vicore Pharma (Göteborg, Sweden). PD123319 was
purchased from SigmaeAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). ET-1 was from American
Peptide Company, Inc (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). All other chemicals were purchased
from Fisher Scientiﬁc (Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
2.10. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Of the 208 rats used for this study, 8 rats died shortly after or did not recover
from the ET-1-induced MCAO. A further 6 rats were excluded from the study as they
did not develop any discernable stroke following the ET-1 induced MCAO, as evidenced by perfect neurological scores and conﬁrmed after euthanasia by assessment
of cerebral infarct as described above.
2.11. Experimental groups, randomization and allocation concealment
Rats were assigned within each of the Experimental protocols as follows. Each rat
within these protocols was assigned a number, and then assigned to a group using a
computer program (Microsoft Excel). This allocation was concealed to the individuals
who performed the ET-1 induced MCAO, drug treatments and behavioral testing.
2.12. Data analyses
Data are expressed as means  SEM. Statistical signiﬁcance was evaluated, as
speciﬁed in the ﬁgure legends, with the use of the KruskaleWallis test, One-way
ANOVA, Mann Whitney test or unpaired t-test, as well as with Dunn’s Multiple
Comparison test, Bonferroni’s test, or NewmaneKeuls Multiple Comparison Test for
post-hoc analyses when appropriate. Power analyses were performed to calculate
sample sizes. Differences were considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05.

the observed beneﬁcial actions of C21 are not a result of antagonizing or offsetting the actions of ET-1 to elicit vasoconstriction and
reduce CBF.
3.3. Systemic post-stroke treatment with C21 reduces the
neurological deﬁcits and cerebral injury produced by ET-1 induced
MCAO
Administration of C21 (0.03 mg/kg) via the IP route 4, 24 and
48 h after MCAO induction, as described in Experiment 5 of the
Methods, signiﬁcantly decreased the cerebral infarct size and
neurological deﬁcits when compared with control rats (Fig. 4). To
determine whether the cerebroprotective properties of systemically applied C21 are a direct result of an agonist effect via AT2R, we
tested the effects of ICV infusion of the AT2R antagonist PD123319
(0.3 mg/ml/h) on the cerebroprotective action of C21 administered IP
post-MCAO, as described in Experiment 6 (Methods). IP post-MCAO
only treatment with C21 signiﬁcantly decreased the cerebral infarct
size and neurological deﬁcits when compared with control rats
(Fig. 5), consistent with the data in Fig. 4. Co-treatment with
PD123319 infused ICV eliminated the cerebroprotective effect of
systemically administered C21 as assessed by measurement of cerebral infarct size, as well as neurological examinations (Fig. 5).
3.4. Effects of IP post-stroke treatment with C21 on the expression
of pro-inﬂammatory genes within the cerebral cortex ipsilateral to
the ET-1 induced MCAO
Because pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (PIC) and iNOS are induced
following cerebral infarction and contribute to neuronal damage

137

(Lee et al., 2005; Nakashima et al., 1995; Patel et al., 2013), we tested
the effects of C21 administered IP post-stroke on the expression of
pro-inﬂammatory genes in the cerebral cortex ipsilateral to the ET1 induced MCAO. We chose to analyze gene expression 24 h postMCAO, as mRNA analyses in the cerebral cortex ipsilateral to the
stroke performed at later time points post-MCAO proved less reliable (data not shown). Thus, we administered C21 (0.03 mg/kg) IP
at 4 and 12 h post-stroke, as described in Experiment 7 (Methods).
This treatment strategy with C21 was as effective in producing a
cerebroprotective action (Fig. 6) as when it was administered 4, 24
and 48 h post ET-1 induced MCAO (Figs. 4 and 5). qRT-PCR analyses
revealed that ET-1 induced MCAO elicited signiﬁcant increases in
the levels of mRNAs for CD11b (marker for monocytes/microglia
activation), GFAP (marker for astrogliosis), CCL2 (marker of
monocyte/microglial recruitment) and CCR2 (receptor for CCL2)
when compared with rats that underwent sham MCAO (Fig. 7). The
increases in CCL2 and CCR2 mRNAs were signiﬁcantly reduced in
the rats treated with C21 (Fig. 7). While there was a trend for CD11b
and GFAP mRNAs to be reduced in the C21-treated rats, the effects
of this AT2R agonist were not signiﬁcant (Fig. 7). In addition, C21
treatment did not alter the increase in the level of mRNA for MPO
(neutrophil marker) (not shown). The levels of iNOS, eNOS, IL-1a,
IL-1b mRNAs (Fig. 8) and IL-6 mRNA (not shown) were all signiﬁcantly increased in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex at 24 h post ET-1
induced MCAO, compared with sham MCAO rats. The level of iNOS
mRNA was signiﬁcantly reduced in the C21-treated rats, but there
were no signiﬁcant effects on the other genes tested (eNOS, IL-1a,
IL-1b and IL-6 mRNAs).
4. Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that administration of the AT2R
agonist C21 at a dose that is selective for AT2R (Jehle et al., 2012;
Namsolleck et al., 2013; Paulis et al., 2012) is cerebroprotective
during ischemic stroke. Central (ICV) or systemic (IP) pre-treatment
with C21 limits the cerebral infarct size and neurological deﬁcits
due to ET-1 induced MCAO. Importantly, C21 administered systemically only after stroke also reduced cerebral infarct size and
neurological deﬁcits due to ET-1 induced MCAO, effects that were
abolished by an AT2R antagonist. The data also indicate that these
actions of C21 were independent of effects on CBF, but were associated with reductions in certain inﬂammatory markers in the
brain. Thus, the data presented here are proof of principle that
selective activation of AT2R post stroke via a systemic route can
exert beneﬁcial effects after ischemic stroke. Thus, the data provide
evidence that direct activation of the AT2R with the non-peptide
agonist C21 has potential utility for acute or preventative stroke
therapy. In addition to these signiﬁcant ﬁndings, our experiments
raise multiple important questions about the mechanism and signiﬁcance of AT2R mediated cerebroprotection.
Major questions raised by our results concern the locus and
mechanism of C21 mediated cerebroprotection. Our previous
studies on angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], which exerts a similar
reduction in cerebral infarct size and neurological deﬁcits after ET-1
induced MCAO, suggested that the beneﬁcial actions of this agent
did not involve a cerebrovascular mechanism (Mecca et al., 2011).
Similar to these ﬁndings, IP administration of C21 did not alter
baseline CBF, nor did it alter the reduction in CBF elicited by ET-1
induced MCAO (Fig. 3). Additionally, the fact that C21 exerts cerebroprotection when administered 4 h post stroke, at which time
cell death processes are underway, might suggest that the beneﬁcial actions of this AT2R agonist do not involve a cerebrovascular
mechanism. However, without a more detailed analysis of CBF using microspheres or magnetic resonance imaging of regional cerebral circulation we cannot exclude the possibility that C21 is

acting to improve stroke penumbral circulation. Regarding an
alternative cerebroprotective mechanism, our data do demonstrate
that C21 administered peripherally post stroke attenuated the increase in iNOS expression in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex
following ET-1 induced MCAO. This ﬁnding is relevant because
induction of iNOS in activated microglia and inﬁltrating leukocytes
leads to subsequent generation of toxic levels of NO during the
delayed events that contribute to neuronal death following cerebral
ischemia (Nakashima et al., 1995; Patel et al., 2013). Our data
indicate that the increases in MPO, GFAP and CD11b mRNAs that
occur in the cerebral cortex post-stroke were not signiﬁcantly
altered in the C21-treated rats, suggesting that it does not alter

neutrophil invasion, astrogliosis and microglial activation, respectively. Furthermore, the stroke-induced increases in PICs such as IL1a and IL-1b, which are known to induce iNOS expression in the
infarct zone (Patel et al., 2013), were not signiﬁcantly altered in the
C21-injected rats. However, the data presented here indicate that
the increases in the levels of mRNAs for CCL2 and its receptor CCR2
elicited by ET-1 induced MCAO are signiﬁcantly less in the C21
treated rats (Fig. 7). CCL2 is known to promote post stroke
inﬂammation through monocyte and microglia recruitment (El
Khoury et al., 2007; Schilling et al., 2009). Based on this, we
might expect attenuation of the increased CD11b expression, which
should represent both microglial and monocyte recruitment, and

Fig. 8. Peripheral post-stroke administration of C21 reduces iNOS mRNA in the cerebral cortex. Rats were injected IP with C21 (0.03 mg/kg) or saline (0.9%) at 4 and 12 h following
MCAO induction by ET-1 or sham stroke. One-day post-MCAO, the ipsilateral cerebral cortex was used for qRT-PCR analyses. Shown are the respective levels of iNOS, eNOS, IL-1a
and IL-1b mRNAs in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex in rats that underwent MCAO or sham stroke plus IP C21 or saline treatments. Data (normalized against GAPDH) are means  SEM

PICs that are secreted from these cells. While there was a tendency
for CD11b and IL-1b mRNA expression to be attenuated in the
cortex of C21-treated rats (Figs. 7 and 8), it is possible that signiﬁcant changes would be detected at later time points post-stroke
when the inﬂammatory response is more robust. Other possibilities are that C21 has an action downstream of PIC expression, and
that an alternate molecule other than the PICs tested is involved in
the increased iNOS expression that occurs during ischemic stroke.
Further experiments examining the differential expression of the
genes for CD11b and PICs over time will be necessary to fully
elucidate the involvement of microglia/macrophages in the cerebroprotective mechanism of C21. These results also raise questions
of AT2R cellular localization and C21 binding. Studies utilizing
immunostaining and quantative PCR provide evidence that AT2R
protein and mRNA is present in rat microglia (Miyoshi et al., 2008;
Rodriguez-Pallares et al., 2008), and future experiments will
determine the effects of C21 on the activation and migration of
these cells.
Targeting the CNS with pharmacotherapy has proven difﬁcult
because the blood brain barrier (BBB) excludes many molecules and
limits their activity centrally (Pardridge, 2005). Most small molecules that cross the BBB have a molecular mass less than 400e500 g/
mol and are very lipophilic (Ghose et al., 1999). These concerns were
the rationale for our initial experiments where C21 was delivered
directly into the cerebral ventricle. C21 is hydrophilic and has a
molecular mass of 497.6 g/mol, and there is minimal transport of this
drug across the BBB after peripheral administration (Shraim et al.,
2011). However, it is clear that BBB disruption occurs following
ischemic insult (Yang and Rosenberg, 2011), and based on our data a

peripheral treatment strategy would likely be effective. Further
experiments will elicit the window available for effective cerebroprotection when C21 is administered as a post-stroke therapy.
Several strengths of this study should be addressed as it offers
advantages to previous investigations of AT2R stimulation for cerebroprotection. For example, previous studies indicated that the
peptide AT2R agonist, CGP42112, was cerebroprotective when
administered centrally prior to or after stroke (McCarthy et al.,
2009, 2012). Our experiments have included a post-stroke systemic treatment regimen with C21 that would be clinically signiﬁcant for human stroke treatment. It is also noteworthy that C21 is
an orally active compound (Steckelings et al., 2011).
In conclusion, the current work demonstrates that administration of the selective AT2R agonist C21, post insult, results in signiﬁcant beneﬁcial actions against ischemic stroke. Importantly, this
cerebroprotective action of AT2R agonism can be obtained when
the C21 is applied systemically post stroke over a time frame that
may be of therapeutic value. Thus, the current work provides
important new data that activation of cerebral AT2R may be a viable
therapeutic avenue for ischemia-induced cerebrovascular disease.
