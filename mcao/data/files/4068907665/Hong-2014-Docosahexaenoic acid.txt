Recently we demonstrated that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is highly neuroprotective when animals were
allowed to survive during one week. This study was conducted to establish whether the neuroprotection induced
by DHA persists with chronic survival. Sprague–Dawley rats underwent 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo) and treated with DHA or saline at 3 h after MCAo. Animals received neurobehavioral examination (composite neuroscore, rota-rod, beam walking and Y maze tests) followed by ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging
and histopathology at 3 weeks. DHA improved composite neurologic score beginning on day 1 by 20%, which
persisted throughout weeks 1–3 by 24–41% compared to the saline-treated group. DHA prolonged the latency
in rota-rod on weeks 2–3 by 162–178%, enhanced balance performance in the beam walking test on weeks 1
and 2 by 42–51%, and decreased the number of entries in the Y maze test by 51% and spontaneous alteration
by 53% on week 2 compared to the saline-treated group. DHA treatment reduced tissue loss (computed from
T2-weighted images) by 24% and total and cortical infarct volumes by 46% and 54% compared to the salinetreated group. These results show that DHA confers enduring ischemic neuroprotection.

1. Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States.
Annually, 795,000 people experience new or recurrent stroke and 41%
of stroke patients die [1]. Even though some patients survive stroke,
they suffer serious long-term disabilities such as a locomotion, sensory,
vision, language and cognition. Thus, maximal enhancement of behavioral function accompanied with the reduction of infarction is a major
goal of post-stroke therapy with a promise better quality of life for
stroke survivors.
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6, n = 3) is a member of the essential omega-3 fatty acid family and is concentrated in the membranes of
the central nervous system [2]. DHA is well known as a robust
neuroprotectant against experimental stroke [3–5]. Recently we demonstrated that DHA improves behavioral function, decreases infarct volume, promotes cell survival in the ischemic penumbra as well as
resolution of cerebral edema in one week of survival after focal cerebral
ischemia in rats [3–5]. In addition, therapeutic window shows that DHA

is neuroprotective when administered up to 5 h after experimental
stroke during 7 days survival period [3]. The dose–response study in
rats with transient focal cerebral ischemia showed that a 5 mg/kg dosage was highly neuroprotective [3–5]; thus, this dose was applied in
this study.
The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that
DHA-induced neuroprotection endures in animals allowed to survive
for three weeks after focal ischemic insult. The effect of DHA treatment
was investigated using a battery of different behavioral tests in conjunction with ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathology.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Animal preparation
All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Louisiana State University
Health Sciences Center, New Orleans. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (290
to 330 g; Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA, USA) were fasted
overnight with free access to water before surgical procedure. Anesthesia was induced by inhalation of 3% of isoﬂurane in a mixture of 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen. During the procedure, isoﬂurane was
maintained at 1% in the same ratio of nitrous oxide and oxygen. Orally
intubated rats were paralyzed by injection of pancuronium bromide
(0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) and then mechanically ventilated during the surgical
procedure. A catheter was inserted in the right femoral vein and then

removed after infusion of the drug. The femoral arterial catheter was
not implanted and we did not measure arterial blood gases and glucose, to avoid functional impairment of the hindlimb. Rectal (CMA/
150 Temperature Controller, CMA/Microdialysis AB, Stockholm,
Sweden) and cranial (left temporalis muscle; Omega Engineering,
Stamford, CT, USA) temperatures were monitored and maintained at
37.0 to 37.5 °C during surgical procedures. Rectal temperature and
body weight were closely monitored during the three-week survival
period.

sides, when the rat is traversing the beam for 3 min [10]. A step that
slipped outside of beam was considered a full slip, while touching the
side of the beam was deﬁned as a half slip [11]. Balance performance
on the beam was graded as follows: 0 = Balances with steady posture;
1 = Grasps side of beam; 2 = Hugs beam and 1 limb falls down from
beam; 3 = Hugs beam and 2 limbs fall down from beam; 4 = Attempts
to balance on beam but falls off N 40 sec; 5 = Attempts to balance on
beam but falls off N 20 sec; 6 = Falls off, no attempt to balance or
hang on beam b 20 sec [9]. Rats were given a 5-min break between
trials.

2.2. Focal cerebral ischemia model
The right middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded for 2 h by
intraluminal ﬁlament, as we previously described [6]. Brieﬂy, the right
common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed through an incision in the
neck. The CCA was isolated from surrounding nerves. The distal external
carotid artery (ECA) and pterygopalatine arteries were tied. A 4-cm of
3–0 monoﬁlament nylon suture coated with poly-Lysine was introduced via the proximal ECA into the internal carotid artery and MCA.
After 2 h of MCAo, rats were anesthetized with the same anesthetic
combination and intraluminal ﬁlaments were removed. The animals
were allowed to survive for three weeks with free access to water and
food.

2.4.4. Y maze test
The Y maze test was used to evaluate cognitive function, especially
working memory in a new environment [12]. During the pre-training
period, rats were allowed to explore the Y maze (Stoelting, Wood
Dale, IL, USA) for 30 min. On weeks 1, 2 and 3 after treatment, the number of entries, spontaneous alteration and percentage of alteration were
recorded for 8 min three times per test day. Entry is deﬁned as a complete placement of hind paws within the arm of the maze. Spontaneous
alteration is considered when a rat visits a new arm and does not return
to one of previously-visited two arms. The percentage of alteration was
calculated as follows: [Number of spontaneous alteration/(Number of
entry − 2)] × 100 [12]. Rats were given a 10-min break between trials.

2.3. Treatment
2.5. Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
The agents (DHA; 5 mg/kg, Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI; n = 12) or vehicle (0.9% saline; n = 8) were administered intravenously into the
femoral vein at 3 h after onset of MCAo.
2.4. Behavioral tests
Rats were pre-trained for the rota-rod, beam walking, and Y maze
tests for three consecutive days before MCAo procedure. Animals that
failed to accomplish the requirements of the tests during pre-training
period were excluded from the study. All behavioral tests were performed by an investigator blinded to the treatment groups.
2.4.1. Total neurologic score
A composite neurological battery was conducted during MCAo (at
60 min) and then on days 1, 2, 3 and weeks 1, 2, and 3 after treatment.
The battery consisted of two tests: (1) the postural reﬂex test to evaluate upper body posture when the animal is suspended by the tail, and
(2) forelimb placing test to assess sensorimotor integration in forelimb
placing responses to visual, tactile and proprioceptive stimuli [6]. Total
neurologic score was graded on a scale from 0 (normal) to 12 (maximal
deﬁcit), as we previously described [6]. Only animals with a high-grade
neurological deﬁcit (10 or greater) were included in the study.
2.4.2. Rota-rod test
Rota-rod test was used to evaluate the motor function after cerebral
ischemia [7]. In the pre-training period, animals were trained to run for
5 min at 16 RPM on a rota-rod (ENV-575, Med Associate, Inc., Albans,
VT, USA). On weeks 1, 2 and 3 after treatment, the rota-rod test
consisted of ﬁve trials per day on each test day. Each trial recorded the
time to fall during a 5-min session at the speed of 16 RPM. A 15-min
break was given between the ﬁve trials.

At three weeks after completion of the behavioral tests, brains were
removed after transcardiac perfusion with 0.9% saline followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde. High resolution ex vivo MRI data of brains were obtained using an 11.7 T Bruker Advance 8.9 cm horizontal bone instrument equipped with an 89 mm (ID) receiver coil (Bruker Biospin,
Billerica, MA, USA). Lesion volume, tissue loss, left and right hemispheres areas and ventricles size were quantiﬁed from high resolution
T2 weighted images (T2WI). Residual hemisphere volume on each
side was calculated by subtraction of ventricle volume from the volume
of the hemisphere on each side. Tissue loss was deﬁned as the subtraction of residual volume of the lesion hemisphere from residual volume
of the non-lesion hemisphere.
2.6. Histopathology
Histopathology was performed after completion of ex vivo MRI.
Cryoprotected brains were cut into twenty-micron-thick sections in the
coronal plane and stained with thionine (Nissl). Brain sections were
then digitized (MCID core imaging software; InterFocus Imaging Ltd.,
Cambridge, England) at nine standardized coronal levels (bregma levels:
+5.2, +2.7, +1.2, −0.3, −1.3, −1.8, −3.8, −5.0 and −7.3 mm) [13]
using a CCD camera (QICAM Fast 1394, QIMAGING, British Columbia,
Canada). An investigator blinded to the experimental groups then
outlined the zone of the cortical and subcortical infarction as well as
the left and right hemispheres of each section. Infarct volume was calculated as the integrated product of the cross-sectional area and intersectional distance. Brain sections were imaged on a motorized microscope BX61VS (Olympus, Japan) at 20 × objective.
2.7. Statistical analysis

2.4.3. Beam walking test
The beam walking test was used to assess motor coordination, integration [8] and balance performance [9] after focal cerebral ischemia.
Rats were pre-trained to cross the beam (100 cm × 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm;
60 cm above ﬂoor) voluntarily without a slip. The test was conducted
three times per day on weeks 1, 2 and 3 after treatment.
Motor coordination and integration were assessed by counting the
number of half and full slips on the ipsilateral and contralateral (stroke)

Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by
Bonferroni procedure to correct multiple comparisons was performed.
Two-tailed Student's t-tests were used for two-group comparisons.
One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test was used in the secondary
analysis of the ﬁnal behavioral endpoints. Data are presented as mean
values ± SEM. Differences at p b 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. Physiological variables
There were no signiﬁcant differences in rectal and cranial (temporalis
muscle) temperatures and body weight between DHA (n = 12) and saline (n = 8) treated groups during the three-week survival period
(Table 1). All animals lost body weight during the ﬁrst week, but
regained it afterward (Table 1).
3.2. Behavioral tests
3.2.1. Composite neurologic score
The saline-treated group showed a continuous severe composite
neurologic score despite moderate improvement throughout the
three-week survival period. Rats treated with DHA showed an improved composite neurologic score compared to the saline group during
the three-week survival period (Fig. 1A). Signiﬁcant improvement of visual (sideway), tactile (dorsal and lateral) forelimb placing reaction was
observed in DHA-treated rats during the three-week survival period
compared to the vehicle group (Fig. 1B-D). Rats treated with DHA
tended to have an improved postural reﬂex, visual placing-forward
and proprioceptive reﬂex, but this did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.
3.2.2. Rota-rod
The rats treated with saline continued to show a decrease in the time
it took to fall of the rota-rod during the three-week survival period.
Treatment with DHA prolonged the time to fall throughout the three
weeks, but was only statistically signiﬁcant on weeks 2 and 3 compared
to the saline-treated group (Fig. 2A).

that the vehicle group was impaired throughout the three weeks survival period despite the spontaneous improvement. On the contrary, the
balance performance of DHA treated group was almost recovered to
the level of pre-training period on week 3 (p b 0.01, One-way ANOVA
followed by Dunnett's test; Fig. 2B).
3.2.4. Y maze
The number of entries, spontaneous alterations and percentage of alterations were increased in saline-treated rats on weeks 1, 2, and 3
(Fig. 2C and D). Treatment with DHA lowered the number of entries
and spontaneous alterations compared to saline-treated rats throughout the three-week survival period, but was only statistically signiﬁcant
on week 2 (Fig. 2C and D). There was no difference of percentage in alteration between the groups.
4. Ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging
Representative T2WI and ADC maps from saline- and DHA-treated
rats are presented in Fig. 3A. T2 hyperintensities were observed in the
cortex and striatum of saline-treated rat. In contrast, DHA-treated rat
had a smaller lesion. ADC maps displayed no differences between
groups. Analysis of T2WI data on week 3 demonstrated that treatment
with DHA attenuated the lesion volume by 20.9% (Fig. 3B) and decreased the relative tissue loss to the non-lesion hemisphere by 23.4%
(Fig. 3C) compared to the saline-treated group. There were no differences in ventricle size and residual volumes in right hemisphere between groups on week 3.
5. Histopathology
Large zones of infarct, involving cortical and subcortical regions from
a saline-treated rat on week 3, are presented in Fig. 4A. In contrast,
smaller cortical and subcortical infarct areas were observed in the
DHA-treated animal (Fig. 4A). Treatment with DHA reduced cortical
and total infarct areas at multiple coronal levels compared to saline
treatment (Fig. 4B). Maximal protection by DHA treatment occurred
within the cortex (by 53.9%), compared to saline treatment (Fig. 4C).
Also DHA treatment ameliorated subcortical infarct volume, but this
amelioration was not signiﬁcant. Total infarct volume was decreased
by DHA treatment (by 46.2%) compared to saline-treated group
(Fig. 4C). Six animals died during the experiment: 3 in the saline
group (died on days 1 and 13) and 3 rats in the DHA group (died on
days 1, 2 and 6).

was severely impaired in the vehicle group throughout the three-week
survival period (Fig. 2B). In contrast, rats treated with DHA showed
signiﬁcantly-improved balance performance compared to the saline
group for weeks 1 and 2 (Fig. 2B). Secondary analysis of the balance performance, comparing pre-training vs. week three time point, revealed,

The results of this study establish that systemic administration of
DHA confers marked and enduring neuroprotection, as assessed together by neurobehavioral, ex vivo MRI and histological methods, in animals
followed for three weeks after focal cerebral ischemia. Neurobehavioral
improvement began within one day after insult and endured for three
weeks. The ex vivo MRI and histological data in DHA-treated animals
were concordant with the behavioral outcome. These results are very
encouraging, because the neuroprotective efﬁcacy shown with short
survival periods may not necessarily persist during longer survival
periods.
Recent research revealed that the omega-3 fatty acid found in ﬁsh oil
decreases the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease [14]. DHA and its
precursor, linolenic acid (18:3, n-3) are processed in the liver, which
then delivers DHA to the central nervous system through the blood
stream [15]. DHA is necessary to maintain proper physical conformation
of ion channels, receptors and transporters in membranes in cells involved in memory, synaptic membrane biogenesis and function and
neuroprotection [16]. After ischemic insult, free DHA, which is released
from the cell membrane, leads to depletion of omega-3 polyunsaturated

fatty acids in the brain. Depletion of DHA induces extensive damage of
sensory, behavioral and cognitive function [17].
Neurobehavioral deﬁcits are important indicators of stroke development in humans as well as in experimental cerebral ischemia models.
Several behavioral tests have been applied to ischemia research in
regards to clinical criteria. A recent report has called attention to the importance of long-term functional assessment after stroke to improve
translation from bench to bedside [18]. Sensorimotor deﬁcit, a distinguished aspect of neurological function, was accurately evaluated in
our study by composite neurological score [6]. The applied battery
consisted of two tests for evaluating upper body posture and assessing
sensorimotor integration in forelimb placing responses to visual, tactile
and proprioceptive stimuli [6]. Recently we demonstrated the improvement of the composite neurological function in animals treated with
DHA, which survived for one week after focal cerebral ischemia [3–5].
The results from our study showed that DHA treatment signiﬁcantly improved composite neurological score on day 1 (by 20%), day 2 (by 24%),
day 3 (by 25%) and continued through week 1 (by 29%), week 2 (by
30%) and week 3 (by 41%) compared to the vehicle group.
In addition to the composite neurological score, we conducted other
behavioral tests focused on motor coordination/integration, balance
and cognitive function after focal cerebral ischemia. The rota-rod is a
well-established method used to evaluate motor function because failure of coordination and integration of limb movement leads to animals
falling off the rota-rod [19].
Beneﬁcial effect of DHA treatment on locomotor activity was shown
after global cerebral ischemia in gerbils (200 mg/kg, once a day for 10
weeks) [20] and neonatal hypoxic–ischemic brain injury in rats (maternal supplementation of DHA + eicosapentaenoic acid, 15 mg in every
gram of regular diet, given from the second day of pregnancy to 14
days of parturition) [21]. On the contrary, one study reported the detrimental effects of very low dose of DHA (500 nmol/kg, administered i.p.

at 60 min after reperfusion) on the accelerated rota-rod performance
after transient focal cerebral ischemia [22].
Our data demonstrated that intravenous administration of DHA
(5 mg/kg, i.v.) prolonged the time to fall from the rota-rod with ﬁxed
speed by 178% on week 2 and by 163% on week 3. In addition, DHA
treatment showed the improvement of the balance performance in
the beam walking test by 42% on week 1 and by 51% on week 2 compared to the saline-treated group.
Stroke patients have twice the risk of developing dementia, resulting
in vascular lesions, white matter changes or a combination of all of these
[23]. A consistent dietary supplementation of DHA was found to be beneﬁcial for memory function in short-term [24] and long-term survival in
global cerebral ischemia [25–27], as well as in neonatal hypoxic brain
injury models [23]. Our data demonstrates that DHA treatment improves cognitive function using a Y maze by lowering the number of entries by 51% and the number of spontaneous alterations by 53%
compared to saline-treated rats on week 2.
Restoration of behavioral function is highly associated with the reduction of lesion volume. We had shown recently that DHA treatment
signiﬁcantly attenuates lesion volume accompanied with resolution of
edema using in vivo MRI during a seven-day survival period after focal
cerebral ischemia [3]. Independent work performed in the same period
showed that DHA treatment also reduced lesion volume using in vivo
MRI on day 1 after MCAo [28]. Our ex vivo T2WI data revealed that administration of DHA reduced total lesion volume and the relative tissue
loss to the non-lesion hemisphere compared to saline treatment on
week 3. Brain edema and water mobility were not different between
groups on week 3 because most edema was resolved within seven
days after stroke.
Our previous studies showed a signiﬁcant decrease of infarct volume
with DHA treatment in rats that survived for seven days after focal cerebral ischemia [3–5]. The histological analysis from our current study

Fig. 4. Histopathology at three weeks after stroke. Panel A shows representative computer generated Nissl-stained brain sections of rats treated with saline or DHA. The saline-treated rat
shows extensive lesion with development of cavities in the cortex and subcortex. In contrast, the DHA-treated rat has a smaller infarction in the cortical and subcortical areas. Panels B and
C present cortical, subcortical and total infarct areas and volumes. Signiﬁcant reduction of cortical and total infarct areas and volumes were present in DHA-treated animals compared to
the saline group. Data are means ± SEM. * signiﬁcantly different from vehicle group (P b 0.05, repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni tests).

showed that treatment with DHA reduced cortical infarct by 54% and
total infarct volumes by 46% on week 3.
The mechanism of DHA neuroprotection is still not completely understood. Previous studies showed that DHA salvages neurons and astrocytes within the infarcted areas [3,4]. DHA rescues more neurons
by protecting astrocytes, which have a critical role in the maintenance
and protection of neurons through secretion of growth and neurotrophic factors. Also DHA downregulates activation of microglia in the infarcted regions [3]. Microglia-activated response to injury mediates intrinsic
neuroinﬂammation that results during apoptosis and phagocytosis of
debris [29]. There is evidence for an anti-inﬂammatory effect of DHA
during ischemic injury [3]. Furthermore, DHA treatment emphasizes
the beneﬁcial role in the cellular survival cascade after focal cerebral ischemic injury by upregulation of p 473 and p 308 Akt phosphorylation
and S6 and pGSK in GSK signaling [5]. Pan et al. suggested that suppression of cytotoxic factor production accompanied with promotion of
pro-survival cascade mediated by ERK and/or Bcl-2 enhances

neuroprotection by DHA pretreatment in focal cerebral ischemia.
Along with the anti-inﬂammatory and pro-survival effect, the antioxidant effect of DHA was shown by a decrease of lipid peroxidation
in ischemic injury using F2-isoprostanes, which is a reliable marker
for oxidative stress [28]. Also consistent administration of ethylDHA demonstrated an anti-oxidant property in a global ischemic
gerbil model by free radical scavenging, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, prevention of GSH depletion and lowering of GSH-Px and CAT
activity [20]. These mechanisms provide a possible explanation for
restoration of behavioral functions and attenuation of lesions following cerebral ischemic insult.
In summary, this study demonstrates the persistence of neuroprotection by single intravenous administration of DHA with an improvement of behavioral outcomes accompanied by attenuation of lesions
in chronic survival after experimental stroke. These results show great
promise for translation as a therapeutic option in the treatment of
stroke patients.
