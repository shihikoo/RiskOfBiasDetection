The fractalkine (FKN)–CX3CR1 (FKN receptor) axis reportedly plays an
important role in the progression of many neural pathologies. However, its
role in the recruitment of bone marrow-derived progenitor cells for neurogenesis remains elusive. The chemokine-based mechanism underlying the
migration of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) was
investigated in a double-chamber transmigration model with recombinant
FKN and endogenous FKN extract, and the results confirmed the involvement of FKN in migration. This chemotactic response was CX3CR1dependent and FKN-sensitive. Western blotting, immunoprecipitation and
transmigration assays revealed that the Janus kinase (Jak)2–signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat)5a–extracellular signal-related
kinase (ERK)1/2 pathway was activated by FKN. Confocal laser scanning
microscopy was used to demonstrate cytoskeletal reorganization caused by
remodeling of the surface receptor integrin a5b1, intracellular phosphorylation of Fak and Pax, and upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1
during BMSC migration. Moreover, significant inhibition of signaling and
migration was detected after treatment of cells with Jak2-interfering RNA
or the antagonist AG490. In addition, the results of a fluorescence immunohistochemical analysis of an in vivo chemotactic model, developed via
transplantation of BMSCs into transient middle cerebral artery-occluded
rats, were consistent with the in vitro results. These findings suggest that
FKN activates Jak2–Stat5a–ERK1/2 signaling through CX3CR1, thereby
triggering integrin-dependent machinery reorganization to allow chemotactic migration of BMSCs towards an ischemic cerebral lesion.

Fractalkine-induced chemotaxis via Jak2 pathway

neuronal necrosis and multiple neurochemical cascades
that are triggered by ischemia–reperfusion (I-R) [2,3].
Fortunately, current chemokine-based approaches provide hope that lost neurons can be replenished and
that communication between neural networks can be
restored.
Chemokines form a superfamily of glycoproteins
that induce directional chemotaxis of cells via corresponding receptors. Fractalkine (FKN, also known as
CX3CL1), one of the few chemokines that is constitutively expressed in the central nervous system [4],
interacts with its specific seven-transmembrane, G-protein-coupled receptor CX3CR1. FXN participates in
multiple neuropathologies involving inflammation,
degeneration, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis, by
improving the migration and adhesion of CX3CR1positive cells [5–7]. Endogenous and exogenous nonneural cells have the potential to migrate and accumulate in ischemic regions through an incompletely
known mechanism. These cells also provide support
for the formation of neurons and associated cells, and
maintain tissue homeostasis during neurogenesis [8].
For example, one type of macrophage that characteristically expresses chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan
can be induced to attach to the vascular wall and
migrate towards ischemic brain lesions via monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 and its receptor CCR2 [9].
Pluripotent cells, primarily bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), show therapeutic superiority, because they specifically localize to injury sites
and show multilineage differentiation. Some in vivo
experimental data suggest that BMSCs, engrafted
either systemically or locally, migrate towards the
ischemic hemisphere and improve functional outcomes
via a stromal cell-derived factor-1a (SDF-1a)–CXCR4
axis-dependent mechanism [10,11].
Another FKN–CX3CR1 axis has also been reported
to be involved in chemotaxis towards ischemic injury,
but most studies have focused on its role in recruiting
proinflammatory cells, such as leukocytes, monocytes,
and lymphocytes, and its contribution to neuroinflammation [3,9,12]. For example, neurons and astrocytes
cause microglia to exert neuroprotective or neurotoxic
effects through an interaction between FKN and
CX3CR1 [13]. Up to now, there have been few studies
on the role that stem cells play in chemotactic migration, especially stem cells employed in transplantation
therapy.
In a previous study, we verified that the FKN–
CX3CR1 axis participates in the directional migration
of systemically grafted BMSCs to an ischemic brain
lesion. We also showed histopathological evidence of
the codistribution of BMSCs with endogenous neurons
892

and astrocytes in ischemic boundary zones showing
high expression of FKN. In addition, RNA interference targeting CX3CR1 significantly inhibited cell
migration [14]. However, the molecular mechanisms
underlying these effects remain unclear. Given the controversial role of FKN in the diversified outcomes of
stroke, this issue is of high importance. We hypothesized that the FKN–CX3CR1 axis shares certain
G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways and
reassembles the adhesion machinery to modulate the
migration of BMSCs. Therefore, we further investigated the role of the FKN–CX3CR1 axis and its
effects on downstream molecules and cytoskeletal components by using both in vitro and in vivo models.

Results
I–R increases the expression of FKN and CX3CR1
A rat middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion
(MCAO) model was employed to replicate a local cerebral infarction that mimicked pathological I-R at a
predetermined time and to illustrate the characteristics
of FKN expression in ischemic brains ex vivo. After
occlusion for 2 h, the spatial distribution of the ischemic core and peri-ischemic region could be grossly recognized via triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC)
staining, and differential production of FKN within
the ischemic core could be differentiated by microscopic immunohistology (Fig. 1A,B). A previous study
reported that cerebral FKN was primarily produced
by neurons and hypoxic astrocytes in the cortex [9];
however, our histopathological results indicated that
FKN was notably upregulated in the peri-ischemic
region 12 h after MCAO. At 24 h, FKN peaked at a
value of 2.7-fold the level of FKN at MCAO onset
(P < 0.01), and this augmentation was maintained for
72 h (Fig. 1C). The corresponding contralateral region
showed compensatory elevation of FKN 12 h after IR, and this increase was sustained for 72 h (P < 0.05).
Previous studies showed that FKN functioned in
both the membrane-anchored form (a-FKN, for adhesion) and the released soluble form (s-FKN, chemoattraction), and the expression of these two forms might
occur in different patterns [7]. Hence, in this study,
ELISA-based quantification of these two forms was
employed to discriminate their composition within an
endogenous cerebral filtrate. The results revealed that
the level of s-FKN was markedly increased in the
entire central ischemic block, accounting for nearly
80% of the total FKN content 48 h after I-R onset.
However, a mild increase in the level of a-FKN was
also noted (Fig. 1D).

domain of recombinant FKN (r-FKN)]. We observed
markedly increased CX3CR1 expression following
exposure of BMSCs toH-R for 2 h or incubation of
BMSCs with r-FKN at 100 ngmL 1, as demonstrated

893

by the results of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR),
western blotting of cell lysates, and whole-cell immunohistochemistry. When BMSCs were pretreated with
CX3CR1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA), the upregulation of CX3CR1 caused by r-FKN stimulation was
significantly inhibited at the mRNA level (by ~ 60%)
(Fig. 1E).

A

The FKN–CX3CR1 axis contributes greatly to
BMSC migration
We investigated whether the FKN–CX3CR1 axis modulated chemotactic cell migration by using agonist and
antagonist strategies. The migration of cells in a transwell assay was quantified by the use of fluorescence values from the bottom of the transwell chamber. The
results revealed a dose-dependent increase in the number of BMSCs following r-FKN stimulation at an initial
concentration of 10 ngmL 1 for 30 min, and the maximal effect was observed at 100 ngmL 1 (P < 0.01). We
also transfected CX3CR1 shRNA into cultured BMSCs,
and exposed these cells to r-FKN. We found that the
blockade of surface CX3CR1 significantly inhibited the
migration of BMSCs into the bottom chamber, by as
much as 78% (Fig. 2A). Verifying that the ability of
exogenous FKN to stimulate BMSC migration is also
present in the ischemic brain, the filtrate from the ischemic region of the brain markedly promoted the migration of BMSCs after I-R for 24 h (Fig. 2B), and
CX3CR1 knockdown by shRNA also decreased the
number of migrated cells (~ 40%, P < 0.05). Notably,
the blockade efficiency of CX3CR1 shRNA did not
fully replicate the results of the in vitro assay, suggesting
that other chemokines or factors are present in the filtrate, possibly including macrophage inflammatory protein-1a, SDF-1a, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1,
and CXCL10 [11,15].

Jak–Stat signaling was analyzed to explore the participation of specific downstream molecules in
BMSCs treated with FKN. The phosphorylation of
Jak2 was first examined after chemokine stimulation
(Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation at Tyr317 of Jak2
showed a rapid increase, with a transient peak from
1 min to 5 min during r-FKN treatment (phosphorylation at Tyr221 and Tyr1007 was not investigated).
Additionally, Stat5 phosphorylation at Tyr694 was
detected at 5 min, peaked at 15 min, and lasted for

30 min. The total and phosphorylated levels of Jak1,
Jak3, Stat1, Stat2, Stat3 and Stat6 remained
unchanged under our experimental conditions (data
not shown).
To further determine which Stat5 isoform was phosphorylated, we employed an antibody against Stat5a
or an antibody against Stat5b to immunoprecipitate
protein extracts derived from cells incubated with
r-FKN for 15 min or 30 min, and then blotted the

were conducted after treatment of BMSCs with r-FKN (100 ngmL 1) at consecutive time points. Immunoprecipitated PTEN from lysates of
r-FKN-induced BMSCs was employed to determine the phosphatase activity of PTEN, by quantifying the phosphoinositide product
dephosphorylated from phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate substrate, via a competitive ELISA.To further investigate which isoform of
Stat5 was phosphorylated during BMSC migration, BMSCs were incubated with r-FKN at 100 ngmL 1 for 15 min (left two lanes) or 30 min
(right two lanes), and the protein extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Stat5a and Stat5b and then blotting
with antibody against pStat5. (B) BMSCs were pretreated with CX3CR1 shRNA and control shRNA, or Jak2 shRNA, control shRNA, and
AG490, and the inhibition of the phosphorylation of Jak2 (at 5 min), Stat5 (at 10 min) and ERK1/2 (at 15 min) was assessed following
incubation with r-FKN (100 ngmL 1). (C) BMSCs were incubated with Jak2 shRNA or Jak2 inhibitor AG490 (100 lM) overnight, and then
stimulated with r-FKN for 15 min. Western blotting analysis suggested that the phosphorylation of Stat5 and ERK1/2 was significantly
inhibited. (D) The effects of an AG490 gradient and Jak2 shRNA on BMSC migration were determined in transwell chamber assays. Cells
were treated with AG490 (100 lM) or Jak2 shRNA overnight, and then stimulated with r-FKN at 100 ngmL 1 to trigger migration.
Knockdown efficacy of Jak2 was shown by screening protein levels after virus infection. *P < 0.05 and #P < 0.05 as compared with FKNtreated samples and control shRNA + r-FKN-treated samples, respectively.

phospho-Stat5. The results demonstrated that Stat5a
was predominantly phosphorylated following r-FKN
stimulation.

The expression of two other common participants in
cellular migration, ERK1/2 and Akt, was also analyzed following Jak–Stat activation. The results demonstrated that ERK1/2 phosphorylation began at

895

Fractalkine-induced chemotaxis via Jak2 pathway

5 min and persisted for > 30 min. Akt remained
unphosphorylated throughout the stimulation process.
Quantification by western blotting and an ELISAbased phosphatase activity assay for phosphatase and
tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a
key regulator of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase–Akt
pathway, indicated that neither protein expression nor
phosphatase activity showed a significant change after
r-FKN stimulation for 60 min; this result suggests that
PTEN may not be involved in the continued dephosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3A).
To further elucidate the signaling of the CX3CR1–
Jak–Stat and ERK pathways in our model, we examined
the effects of CX3CR1 shRNA on downstream signaling,
and found that the phosphorylation levels of Jak2, Stat5
and ERK1/2 were prominently blocked by CX3CR1
shRNA, although there was a minimal effect on total
protein expression (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, AG490 (a
Jak2 inhibitor) and Jak2 shRNA were employed to interfere with signal transduction mediated by Jak2. The levels of phosphorylated Stat5 and ERK1/2 were
significantly decreased to different extents following
overnight treatment with 10 lM AG490 or incubation
with Jak2 shRNA for 24 h (Fig. 3C).
Therefore, we re-examined the migration of BMSCs
in response to r-FKN following treatment with AG490
and Jak2 shRNA (Fig. 3D). AG490 treatment (10 lM)

significantly reduced BMSC migration, and 100 lM
AG490 completely abolished the FKN-induced increase
in cellular migration. A similar result regarding BMSC
migration was obtained following Jak2 shRNA treatment, but the amount of migration was smaller than
with AG490 treatment (~ 50%, P < 0.05). These data
suggest that Jak2 signal transduction is required for
BMSC migration in response to FKN.
FKN–CX3CR1 triggers cytoskeletal reorganization
via Jak2–Stat5a transduction
Cell transmigration is dominated by complicated migration machinery between the transmembrane integrin
receptor and the cell substratum interface. Therefore,
we focused on the differential activation of components
of this machinery, including integrin, focal adhesion
kinase (Fak), paxillin (Pax), and intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The effects of r-FKN and Jak2
inhibitors on integrin remodeling were determined with
confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and different integrin clustering statuses were examined on the cell
surface. In particular, remodeling of integrin a5b1 was
prominently activated after r-FKN stimulation, as
demonstrated by strong spot/fiber-like fluorescence, but
AG490 and Jak2 shRNA notably inhibited this remodeling (Fig. 4A).

overnight, and this was followed by r-FKN

cell surface was subsequently determined
via CLSM at 550 nm. Integrin a5b1 and

respectively (scale bar: 50 lm). (B)

Western blotting results showed that stimulation
with 100 ngmL 1 r-FKN for 30 min significantly
increased the expression of Fak phosphorylated at
Tyr397, and this dynamic increase lasted for 60 min.
Consequently, Pax phosphorylation at Tyr118 was significantly activated 30 min after r-FKN treatment.
ICAM-1 protein expression increased at an early stage,
5 min after r-FKN incubation (Fig. 4B). However,
Jak2 inhibitors (AG490 or shRNA) diminished the
increase in both Fak and Pax phosphorylation in
response to FKN (Fig. 4C), which suggests that their
activation was dependent on Jak2 but also relied on
two independent pathways downstream of Fak and
Pax. These data indicate that Jak2–Stat5a signaling
mediates the migration of BMSCs in response to FKN
by reorganizing the cytoskeletal system.
Jak2 mediates the chemotactic migration of
transplanted BMSCs towards ischemic brain
lesions
An in vivo BMSC transplantation experiment was conducted in a rat MCAO model to verify the in vitro
results. Frozen coronal brain slices were processed for
immunofluorescence analysis with CLSM on the first
day and third day after transplantation, and the
migration of transplanted BMSCs in ischemic brains
was investigated. The results indicated that GFPlabeled BMSCs were distributed throughout the ischemia-damaged brain in the ipsilateral hemisphere of
recipient rats, including the cortex and striatum. However, the majority of the cells were located in the ischemic boundary region, where homogeneous FKN
immunoreactivity was strongly increased, as observed
through double immunolabeling with GFP and Cy3.
The BMSCs that migrated towards the ischemic region
3 days after cell transplantation were distinctly more
abundant than the BMSCs that migrated on the first
day. In particular, the BMSCs transduced with the
Jak2 shRNA construct were significantly less abundant
in the corresponding ischemic area than in the control
shRNA transplantation groups on the first and third
days after transplantation (Fig. 5A).
According to a well-established method [14], the
number of GFP-positive BMSCs distributed in the
peri-ischemic region was assessed by counting the average number of cells in five equally spaced sections in
each brain block. The results showed that the numbers
of directionally migrated cells at 24 h and 72 h after
cell transplantation were 16.4-fold and 28.3-fold higher
than in the MCAO sham group. In particular, the
BMSCs that migrated in the first 24 h accounted for
57.8% of the total number of cells that accumulated

Fractalkine-induced chemotaxis via Jak2 pathway

throughout the observation period. The chemotactic
capability of the BMSCs was significantly impaired by
Jak2 shRNA at both 24 h and 72 h (Fig. 5B).

Discussion
In this study, the molecular mechanism by which
transplanted multipotent cells restore infarcted cerebral
microenvironments was studied by examining the specific role and molecular mechanism of FKN and its
receptor, CX3CR1, in the migration of transplanted
BMSCs towards ischemic brain lesions. We obtained
definitive evidence that: (a) the increased expression of
endogenous FKN in an ischemic brain shows defined
spatiotemporal characteristics – the action of CX3CR1
on BMSCs is hypoxia-responsive and FKN-sensitive,
and initiates intracellular biochemical changes and
extrinsic mobility; (b) CX3CR1 triggers signal transduction via Jak2–Stat5a and the downstream activation of the ERK1/2 pathway, and these pathways are
required for the chemotactic migration of BMSCs in
response to FKN; and (c) the interaction between
FKN and CX3CR1 triggers substantial cytoskeletal
reorganization, including integrin a5b1 remodeling,
Fak/Pax phosphorylation, and ICAM-1 upregulation,
and this reorganization drives the chemotactic migration of BMSCs towards ischemic brain lesions.
In this study, a well-developed MCAO model was
first employed to determine the expression pattern of
FKN in the ischemic brain from two aspects. Spatiotemporally, endogenous FKN is rapidly accumulated
in both the ipsilateral lesion and contralateral brain,
beginning 12 h after the onset of I-R. Consistent with
a previous report, our preliminary result also suggested
that the ischemic core contributed little to the total
pattern of FKN in the ischemic brain, owing to progressive necrosis and intracerebral cyst formation [16].
We believe that the major contribution to the increase
in FKN mRNA comes from the ipsilateral peri-ischemic region, followed by the contralateral brain. The
expression profile of FKN was also validated in our
transwell chamber migration assay with r-FKN at different concentrations and an endogenous FKN extract
at predetermined times following MCAO.
The majority of the increase in FKN is attributable
to s-FKN, which is released from cell surfaces through
proteolytic cleavage and behaves as a chemotactic factor. The level of a-FKN, which acts as an adhesion
molecule, was also increased slightly in our H-R samples, which may have occurred to enhance local trafficking and crosstalk between neural cells, such as
neurons, astrocytes, and microglia [17], and improve
the neuroregenerative response.

There is accumulating evidence that FKN promotes
the activation of neural and non-neural cells and their
migration to lesions through interactions with
CX3CR1. Increased numbers of leukocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells and T lymphocytes play
critical roles in the clearance of necrotic tissue, the
regulation of inflammation, and the promotion of
functional recovery [3,9,12]. One study explored the
mechanism of FKN/CX3CR1-mediated microglial
activation, and found that hypoxia induced microglial
proliferation and cytokine secretion through p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/protein
kinase C [18]. Another study demonstrated monocyte
chemotaxis in response to FKN, and revealed that
activation of the cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase
Syk and the formation of cell protrusions reorganized
the F-actin cytoskeleton [19]. Furthermore, Cambien
et al. identified phosphoinositide 3-kinase and members of the MAPK family, including ERK1/2, p38
MAPK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, as signaling
components leading to cell adhesion to fibronectin in
response to soluble FKN, by using monocytic cell

lines [20]. During the acute inflammation phase of
atherosclerosis, soluble FKN is shed from the endothelium following I-R, and acts via CX3CR1 to promote neutrophil adhesion through activation of the
Jak–Stat pathway [21]. This signaling, in addition to
MAPK/ERK kinase/ERK1/2 phosphorylation, has
also been shown to be involved in the SDF-1a/
CXCR4-mediated homing of BMSCs to the breast
cancer milieu [22].
These studies inspired our current hypothesis. On the
basis of our preliminary data concerning differences in
mRNA expression levels among Jak isoforms, we conducted systemic immunoblotting, and found that Jak2–
Stat5a signaling was involved in BMSC migration. In
our supplementary studies, the expression patterns of the
Jak and Stat isoforms were shown to be consistent with
their involvement in BMSC migration. Additionally, two
participants in common mechanisms of cell migration,
ERK1/2 and Akt, were examined, and the results confirmed the role of ERK1/2 in BMSC migration.

substratum interface [23]. This study evaluated
cytoskeletal reorganization by determining the expression of integrin, Fak, Pax, and ICAM-1. Integrins are
heterodimeric transmembrane proteins involved in
cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions. The
formation of integrin clusters is a critical step in the
transduction of extracellular stimuli and the triggering
of intracellular structural or biochemical changes [24].
Previous studies suggested that specific integrins are
expressed on neural cells, and significant alterations
in cellular adhesion receptors and their ligands occur
under conditions of cerebral ischemia. For example,
the a6-subunit and b1-subunit of integrin are specifically responsible for the recruitment of microglia to
disease-affected brain regions and the enhanced adhesion of neurons in situ [25]. We determined the activation of integrin a5b1, and we found that
remodeling of a5b1 was a prominent trait of BMSCs
following FKN treatment. Fak and Pax, which colocalize with the integrin-enriched focal adhesion contact
site,
showed
significantly
increased
phosphorylation after FKN stimulation. Therefore,
activated integrin, Fak and Pax form a complex that
promotes the focal contact structure responsible for
cell migration.
Furthermore, we examined the effects of CX3CR1
shRNA, Jak2 shRNA and AG490 (a Jak2 antagonist)
on molecular and cytoskeletal activation. The antagonist effect of AG490 has been well documented in previous studies [20,21], and the efficacy of suppression
by shRNA was confirmed through real-time PCR and
western blotting assays in vitro. We found that the
phosphorylation levels of Jak2, Stat5 and ERK1/2 and
the protein expression of ICAM-1 were markedly
decreased to different extents by CX3CR1 shRNA,
AG490 and Jak2 shRNA treatment. The morphological and quantitative results also suggest that Jak2
shRNA-transfected BMSCs have an impaired ability
to migrate into FKN-rich regions both in vitro and
in vivo.
The neuroprotective or neurotoxic role of FKN has
been debatable until now. Previous studies showed
that the administration of exogenous FKN to rodents
with experimentally induced stroke [26] and plasma
FKN to stroke patients [27] was positively associated
with a smaller infarction size and fewer neurological
deficits. Conversely, genetically FKN-deficient and
CX3CR-deficient mice (FKN / and CX3CR1 / ) are
less susceptible to ischemic insult during an early stage
[28,29]. This work elucidates some of the mechanisms
underlying grafted cell chemotaxis, and provides
insights into the role of FKN from a non-inflammatory perspective. Additional studies might be required
FEBS Journal 282 (2015) 891–903 ª 2015 FEBS

Fractalkine-induced chemotaxis via Jak2 pathway

to broaden our knowledge of the exact mechanism
that drives BMSC chemostaxis towards ischemic brain
lesions, by determining the full influence of phosphorylation sites (e.g. Tyr221 and Tyr1007 of Jak2, Thr202
of ERK1/2, and Tyr925 of FAK) on signal transduction.
In conclusion, we provide experimental evidence
that the FKN–CX3CR1 chemokine axis triggers the
activation of Jak2–Stat5–ERK1/2 signaling and the
cytoskeletal reorganization mediated by integrin a5b1,
and thereby promotes the directional migration of
BMSCs towards an ischemic cerebral lesion. Therefore, elevated or prolonged expression of certain
chemokines by genetic engineering of BMSCs may be
one of the critical targets for novel therapeutic
approaches for stroke therapy.

Experimental procedures
Ethical statement
The Research Council and Ethics Committee of the Third
Military Medical University (Chongqing, China) approved
the study protocol. Animals were housed and treated in
accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the United States National
Institutes of Health.

Materials and reagents
r-FKN (chemokine domain) was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA). The following antibodies
were used in this study: antibodies aganist Jak, Stat, Akt,
ERK, Fak, and Pax and their phosphorylated products
were obtained from Cell Signaling (Boston, MA, USA);
antibodies against ICAM-1 and PTEN were obtained from
Abcam (Cambridge, UK); and antibodies against integrin,
GFP and FKN were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). AG490 (a Jak2 inhibitor) was
obtained from Calbiochem (Billerica, MA, USA). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and FBS were
obtained from Gibco (Boston, MA, USA). The protease
inhibitor PMSF, the RNA extraction reagent Tripure, a
Percoll gradient and Hoechst-33342 were obtained from
Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Protein extraction RIPA buffer was obtained from Cell Signaling. The PTEN activity
ELISA kit was obtained from Echelon Biosciences (Salt
Lake City, UT, USA).

Cell isolation, culture, and treatment
BMSCs were isolated and cultured in accordance with a
previously published report [30]. Briefly, bone marrow was
harvested from the femurs of Wistar rats (Laboratory Ani-

899

Y. Zhang et al.

Fractalkine-induced chemotaxis via Jak2 pathway

mal Center, The Third Military Medical University, China)
and isolated by use of a Percoll gradient. The upper
cell-containing phase was initially plated in DMEM-F12
supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cell passages 3–5 were
used in subsequent experiments. Hypoxia was induced by
exposing BMSCs to a mixture of 5% CO2, 94% N2 and
1% O2 gas in an airtight chamber in the presence of
DMEM-F12 containing 10% FBS. The chamber containing the cell cultures was incubated for 2 h, and subsequently reoxygenated for up to 120 min.

Focal cerebral infarction model, endogenous FKN
extraction, and quantification
A transient MCAO model was employed to replicate ischemic brain lesions in adult Wistar rats, as described in a previous study by our group [14]. Briefly, the MCA was
occluded for 120 min by use of the intraluminal filament
technique to obstruct the origin of the right MCA. A 4-0
nylon monofilament suture with a 0.25-mm-diameter silicone tip was inserted into the internal carotid artery
through the external carotid artery. Reperfusion was performed until 6–72 h after the occlusion was abolished
through the removal of the nylon filament and tip. TTC
staining and Longa’s behavioral scale were adopted to verify the occlusive efficacy. TTC was also used to distinguish
ischemic and normal brain tissues and core and peri-ischemic regions.
To prepare tissue extracts from the ischemic brains, the
infarcted hemisphere, including the ischemic core and periischemic region, was collected in blocks and mechanically
ground in a homogenizer with PBS (200 lL for 5 g of tissue). The samples were then subjected to filtration with a
0.45-lm vacuum filter (Corning, USA) to collect the
extract. Endogenous FKN within the filtrate was measured
with an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, USA), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Transwell chamber migration assay
BMSCs (1 9 105 per well) were seeded on transwell filters
(8-lm pores; Corning, USA) and grown to confluence. The
bottom of the chamber was then filled with 600 lL per well
of DMEM/0.2% BSA with or without the indicated concentrations of r-FKN at 10, 50, 100 or 200 ngmL 1, or
with brain filtrates extracted at different reperfusion time
points starting from the onset of reperfusion to 72 h after
MCAO. The top chamber was removed after incubation
for 6 h at 37 °C, whereas the bottom chamber was subjected to centrifugation at 50 g for 5 min (Beckman Allegra
X-22R centrifuge, USA). The adherent cells in the bottom
chamber were quickly labeled with Hoechst-33342
(5 lgmL 1, 5 min, 4 °C). Fluorescence values were read at
450 nm in a Thermo system (Varioskam Flash, USA) to

900

calculate cell density. For inhibition assays, BMSCs were
either incubated with AG490 (a Jak2 inhibitor) at 10, 50 or
100 lM for 12 h, or transfected with lentivirus for 24–48 h.
The shRNA-treated cells were allowed to recover for 24 h
before the migration assay.

qPCR
Total RNA from brain tissue homogenates of the cerebral parenchyma in the peri-ischemic region and the contralateral hemisphere in the cerebral cortex of MCAO
rats was extracted with the Tripure extraction reagent for
FKN quantification. A brain that received the same
MCAO surgical operation but without insertion of the
monofilament nylon suture was used as the control sample. For CX3CR1 analysis, 5 9 106 BMSCs treated with
H-R and s-FKN stimulation were collected. cDNA was
generated from 1 lg of total RNA with the PrimeScript
RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Japan), and amplified with
primers targeting FKN, CX3CR1 and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase, as reported in our previous
study [14]. Reaction data were collected with an ABI
7500 system (ABI, USA) and quantified with the 2 DDCt
method.

Protein expression and activity – western
blotting, immunoprecipitation, and phosphatase
assays
Three isotypes of Jak and five isotypes of Stat, Akt,
PTEN, Fak, Pax and ICAM-1, as well as their phosphorylated forms, were extensively investigated to determine the
signal transduction and cytoskeletal activation events
related to the response of BMSCs to FKN. Total protein
was extracted from 5 9 106 BMSCs with RIPA buffer
[20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
Na2EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM b-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 lgmL 1 leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF].
A total of 30 lg of protein was separated by SDS/PAGE
and transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes
(Millipore, USA). The proteins were sequentially hybridized with different primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Zhongshan, China).
Protein bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham, USA).
BMSCs were incubated with FKN (100 ngmL 1) for
15 min or 30 min for immunoprecipitation assays. The
cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer.
Antibodies against Stat5a and Stat5b were added, and
the cells were gently rotated at 4 °C overnight. Protein–
agarose beads (Invitrogen, USA) were then added to the
reaction, and this was followed by rotation for 3 h at
4 °C. After washing and centrifugation (12 000 g,
10 min), the pellet was resuspended, denatured, and run

on a NuPAGE gel for immunoblotting with antibodies
against Stat5 phosphorylated on tyrosine.
To determine the protein phosphatase activity of
PTEN, PTEN protein was immunoprecipitated from total
protein derived from BMSC lysate with an antibody
against PTEN and antibody-coupled magnetic beads,
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotechnology, MA, USA). As controls, we used an IgG isoantibody targeting nonspecific protein and the absence of
any antibody. The dephosphorylation was initiated in
phosphatase reaction buffer [100 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0),
10 mM DTT, 200 mM diC16-phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate] for 2 h at 37 °C. The resulting samples
(100 lL) were then transferred to a 96-well plate and
incubated with a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
detector and then with a secondary detector. The production of phosphate from the substrate was measured by a
colorimetric method with absorbance at 450 nm in a
Thermo system (Varioskam Flash, USA). The theoretical
amount of free phosphate was calculated from the standard curve line-fit data.

Integrin reassembly and cytoskeletal
reorganization
CLSM was employed to examine integrin remodeling and
cytoskeletal reorganization [30]. Briefly, BMSCs were cultured in 96-well plates until they reached 70–80% confluence. The cells were treated either with r-FKN
(100 ngmL 1, 30 min) alone, or with AG490 (100 lM)/
shRNA overnight followed by r-FKN stimulation. After
treatment with glutaraldehyde and Triton X-100 at 4 °C
for 15 min and 2 min, respectively, immunofluorescence
staining was performed with a goat primary mAb against
integrin a5b1 (1: 200) and rhodamine-conjugated secondary
antibodies (1 : 100, Zhongshan, China). Finally, nuclei
were counterstained with Hoechst-33342, and fluorescence
images were obtained via CLSM at 550 nm (Leica, Germany).

Silencing of CX3CR1 and Jak2 with lentivirus
shRNA in vivo
shRNA-expressing lentivirus gene transfer vectors targeting
CX3CR1 (CX3CR1 shRNA) and Jak2 (Jak2 shRNA) and
a control (control shRNA) containing a scrambled
sequence were purchased from Genechem (Shanghai,
China). The interference expression constructs were cotransfected into HEK293T cells with Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, CA, USA). Lentivirus particles were collected
after 48 h, and BMSCs were transduced at 37 °C in 5%
CO2 for 24–48 h. The transduction efficiency was measured
on the basis of the frequency of GFP positivity, and knockdown efficacy was confirmed by screening mRNA and protein levels following virus infection.

Fractalkine-induced chemotaxis via Jak2 pathway

BMSC transplantation and
immunohistochemistry
At 24 h after the onset of cerebral I-R, 2 9 106 BMSCs
transfected with either Jak2 shRNA or control shRNA
were injected slowly into the tail vein. Rats were killed
under deep anesthesia at 24 h or 72 h after transplantation. Frozen blocks of coronal brain sections were analyzed with immunohistochemistry, and the GFP label
delivered in the lentivirus enabled the monitoring of the
transplanted cells at 480 nm. A negative sham control
for MCAO was established by performing the same surgical operation but without insertion of the monofilament
nylon suture.
To determine the distribution of transplanted BMSCs
(GFP-positive cells), cell sections were incubated first with
a goat polyclonal antibody against GFP overnight
(1 : 200), and then with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-(goat
IgG) (1 : 100). The colocalization of FKN-positive and
GFP-positive cells was determined by additionally staining
the sections with an antibody against FKN (1 : 200) and a
secondary antibody against Cy3 (1 : 500). All sections were
assessed with CLSM.
To determine the number of GFP-positive cells in the
ischemic brain, the average number of cells in five equally
spaced sections (at ~ 200-lm intervals) was determined in
each brain block, and the number of GFP-positive cells
was counted within the seven 2-mm-thick blocks. To reduce
bias introduced by the sampling parameters, all of the sections obtained from the rats were stained for GFP simultaneously. The analysis was conducted by observers who
were blinded to the treatment conditions.

Statistics
All quantitative assays were performed in triplicate, and
the results are expressed as the means  standard errors.
Statistical significance was evaluated with an unpaired Student’s t-test for comparisons between two groups, and
ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple
comparisons. The significance level was set to 0.05 throughout the analysis.
