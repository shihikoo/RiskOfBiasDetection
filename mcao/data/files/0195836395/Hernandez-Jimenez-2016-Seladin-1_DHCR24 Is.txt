Background and Purpose—3β-Hydroxysteroid-Δ24 reductase (DHCR24) or selective alzheimer disease indicator 1
(seladin-1), an enzyme of cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, has been implicated in neuroprotection, oxidative stress, and
inflammation. However, its role in ischemic stroke remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to characterize the
effect of seladin-1/DHCR24 using an experimental stroke model in mice.
Methods—Dhcr24+/− and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion. In another set
of experiments, WT mice were treated intraperitoneally either with vehicle or U18666A (seladin-1/DHCR24 inhibitor,
10 mg/kg) 30 minutes after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Brains were removed 48 h after middle cerebral artery
occlusion for infarct volume determination. For protein expression determination, peri-infarct region was obtained 24 h
after ischemia, and Western blot or cytometric bead array was performed.
Results—Dhcr24+/− mice displayed larger infarct volumes after middle cerebral artery occlusion than their WT littermates.
Treatment of WT mice with the seladin-1/DHCR24 inhibitor U18666A also increased ischemic lesion. Inflammationrelated mediators were increased after ischemia in Dhcr24+/− mice compared with WT counterparts. Consistent with a
role of cholesterol in proper function of glutamate transporter EAAT2 in membrane lipid rafts, we found a decreased
association of EAAT2 with lipid rafts after ischemia when DHCR24 is genetically deleted or pharmacologically inhibited.
Accordingly, treatment with U18666A decreases [3H]-glutamate uptake in cultured astrocytes.
Conclusions—These results support the idea that lipid raft integrity, ensured by seladin-1/DHCR24, plays a crucial protective
role in the ischemic brain by guaranteeing EAAT2-mediated uptake of glutamate excess.   (Stroke. 2016;47:206-213.

functions have been described for this protein: seladin-1/DHCR24
catalyzes one of the last steps, via the Bloch pathway, in cholesterol
biosynthesis.2 Consistently, seladin-1/DHCR24 deficiency decreases
cholesterol levels in plasma membrane and, subsequently, in the formation and stability of lipid rafts,3 important platforms for cell function mediators,4 thus affecting downstream cellular signaling.1 In
addition to the role in cholesterol metabolism, seladin-1/DHCR24
has been reported to play a role in cellular responses against oxidative and oncogenic stress, apoptotic signaling, and inflammation.1,5–9
From these series of evidences, it seems reasonable to consider
that situations accompanied by a reduction in seladin-1/DHCR24,
similarly to that reported in certain Alzheimer’s disease brains,1

troke is one of the main causes of death and disability in
developed countries (the third leading cause of death in the
United States). In recent years, several studies have focused
on the development of new drugs with brain-protective effects
in experimental models.
Selective alzheimer disease indicator 1 (seladin-1)/3βhydroxysteroid-Δ24 reductase (DHCR24), encoded by Dhcr24
gene, was identified as a human homolog of the DIMINUTO/
DWARF1 gene described previously in plants.1 Seladin-1/DHCR24
is highly conserved in mammals; specifically, in central nervous
system, seladin-1/DHCR24 is highly expressed in neurons where it
is located in endoplasmic reticulum under basal conditions.1 Many

will have important consequences in the response of brain tissue to ischemia. Thus, paucity in seladin-1/DHCR24 could
affect size and time of recovery to ischemic damage, as this
is highly dependent on the level of stress of the affected area.
Alternatively, a reduction in seladin-1/DHCR24 can alter the
distribution of EAAT2, a glutamate transporter primarily localized on astrocytic processes. This transporter, which is responsible for ≤90% of all glutamate transport in adult tissue,10 requires
to be associated to lipid rafts to carry out an adequate glutamate
uptake,11,12 thereby decreasing excitotoxicity after ischemia. All
in all, a deficit in seladin-1/DHCR24 may affect the response to
ischemia through the stress or cholesterol functions of seladin-1/
DHCR24. Importantly, stroke affects mainly the aged population. In this context, it has been suggested that loss of brain
membrane cholesterol underlies deficits of cognition in aging
rodents.13 Therefore, the decay in brain cholesterol found in seladin-1/DHCR24-deficient mice makes these animals a useful tool
to investigate the effects of stroke in the aged population.
To assess the veracity of the above prediction, we have
used both in vivo and in vitro models of experimental ischemia
to characterize the effect of seladin-1/DHCR24 after stroke.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Heterozygous breeding pairs with target depletion of one Dhcr24 allele
were provided by E Feinstein (Quark Biotech Inc). Dhcr24-deficient

mice were bred and genotyped as previously described.14 We obtained gene-deficient (Dhcr24+/−) and wild-type (WT) male animals,
2 months old, from the same littermates. The genetic background of
all animals used was C57BL/6 (albino). Mice were housed in ventilated cages on a 12-h light/dark cycle at 22°C and 35% humidity with
ad libitum access to food and water. All testing was performed during
the light phase of the cycle.
All procedures were performed in accordance with the European
Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC) and reviewed by the
Ethics Committees on Animal Welfare of University Complutense.
A special effort was made to reduce the number of animals used in
the study and to provide them with the most comfortable conditions
possible.

Permanent Cerebral Ischemia by Middle Cerebral
Artery Occlusion
All experiments have been performed and quantified in a randomized manner by investigators blinded to treatment groups for the
prevention of bias. Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane (in
70% N2O, 30% O2) for induction and with 1.5% isoflurane for
maintenance. Rectal temperature was maintained at 36.5°C with
a heating pad. Left common carotid and middle cerebral artery
were exposed and occluded permanently by ligation as previously described.15 Complete interruption of the blood flow was
confirmed under an operating microscope. Sham-operated animals
were subjected to anesthesia and the surgical procedure, but the
occlusion of the arteries was omitted. After surgery, subjects were
returned to their cages and allowed free access to water and food.
The survival rate of the animals until the end of the experiment
was 97.5%.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Experimental
Groups
All the groups were performed and quantified in a randomized fashion
by investigators blinded to treatment groups. The set of experiments
aimed to study the effect of the pharmacological modulation of seladin-1/DHCR24 was performed in 2-month-old WT mice (n=6–10/
group) using the seladin-1/DHCR24 inhibitor U18666A16 (10 mg/kg;
Calbiochem), administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes, 6 h, and 18h
after ischemia. U18666A is a cell-permeable, amphiphilic amino-steroid, high-affinity–binding inhibitor of the Δ24-reductase activity of seladin-1/DHCR2417 (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]=0.15
μmol/L; inhibitory constant [Ki]: 0.000157 mmol/L). A second set of
experiments was performed in 2-month-old WT and Dhcr24+/− mice.

Determination of Physiological Parameters
Physiological parameters (mean arterial blood pressure, blood PO2,
PCO2, and pH, hematocrit and hemoglobin, and rectal temperature)
were measured as described.18

Motor-Deficit Evaluation
Two days after surgical procedure, motor deficit was assessed by
2 independent researchers blinded to experimental conditions.
Motor assessment was performed by using the walking test that
is graded on a scale of 0 to 3, with a higher score indicating more
severe motor deficits, where 0=normal walk, 1=inability to walk
straight, 2=circling toward the paretic side, and 3=fall down to the
paretic side.

Determination of Infarct Size
Two days after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), animals
were killed by cervical dislocation to assess infarct outcome. Brain
was removed and cut into 1-mm-thick coronal slices and stained with
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer). Infarct size was determined
as described.18

Primary Culture of Mouse Cortical Astrocytes
Cortical primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from postnatal day
1 pups of C57BL/6 mice, as previously described.19 After the cells
became confluent, nonastrocytes, such as microglia, were removed by
shaking during 12 h followed by a change of medium, and astrocytes
were detached by trypsin and reseeded on 6-well plates. After 24 h,
astrocytes were washed with serum-free medium and incubated in a
serum-free medium supplemented with dibutyryl-cAMP 100 μmol/L
for 72 hours as described.20 Cells present in the culture were shown to
be 90% astrocytes by immunostaining with the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein using a primary specific anti–glial fibrillary
acidic protein antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA; 1:100 dilution).
Cells were treated for 2 days with the seladin-1/DHCR24 inhibitor U18666A (Calbiochem; 2.5, 5, and 10 μg/mL, once a day).

[3H]-Glutamate Uptake by Astrocytes
[3H]-Glutamate uptake by astrocytic cultures was determined as described.21 Briefly, cultures were washed in control solution and incubated in control solution containing 3 μmol/L glutamate and 8 μCi/mL
of [3H]-glutamate for 90 s, a time in which glutamate uptake was found
to proceed linearly with time. In a parallel set of experiments, cultures
were incubated during the same time in a solution of the same composition but in which Na+ was equiosmotically substituted by choline. At
the end of the incubation, solution was collected, and cells were lysed
by addition of perchloric acid (0.3 mol/L). [3H]-Glutamate uptake was
calculated by subtracting the uptake in the absence of Na+ from the uptake in its presence and expressed as percentage of total [3H]-glutamate.

Western Blot
Brain tissue was collected from peri-infarct area of mice killed 5, 18,
24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days after MCAO for seladin-1/DHCR24 determination. For other proteins, animals were killed 24 h after MCAO.
Protein concentration was determined in peri-infarct tissue homogenates with detergent compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad). Equal
amounts of total protein (20 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Immunodetection

was performed by standard procedures. The membranes were blocked
with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline [TBS]) and probed with specific primary antibodies against seladin-1/DHCR24 (Cell Signaling; 1:1000 dilution), cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2, Santa Cruz; 1:1000), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS,
Santa Cruz; 1:1000), EAAT2 (Cell Signaling; 1:1000), and flotillin-1
(Cell Signaling; 1:1000), and mouse anti–β-actin (Sigma; 1:5000)
was included to ensure equal protein loading. Specific signals were
quantified using densitometry analysis software (ImageJ).

Double Immunofluorescence Staining

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

To examine the cellular location of seladin-1/DHCR24, freefloating coronal brain slices (30 μm) were processed 24 h after
MCAO (n=3 in each group) as described previously.22 In brief,
brain sections were blocked with 5% goat serum and incubated
with mouse anti–neuronal nuclei and anti–glial fibrillary acidic
protein and rabbit anti-DHCR24 (Cell Signaling) 1:100 at 4°C
overnight followed by the appropriate rabbit secondary antibody
Alexa 488 (Invitrogen A-11008) and anti-mouse Cy3 (Jackson
Immuno Research; 715-165-151) 2 h at room temperature. All
immunofluorescence images were obtained in a blinded manner
from 7 correlative slices of each brain. Image acquisition was
performed with a laser-scanning confocal imaging system (Zeiss
LSM710), and image analysis was performed with the ZEN 2009
software (Zeiss). All colocalization images shown were confirmed
by orthogonal projection of z-stack files.

Cytometric Bead Array
Protein homogenates from brain peri-infarct tissue obtained 24 h after MCAO were used to measure the protein levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-10 by a cytometric bead array (Beckton
Dickinson).

homogenates from peri-infarct area of ipsilesional cortices at
all the time points of the study (n=6, P<0.05; Figure 1A).
The expression of seladin-1/DHCR24 was also examined
by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. To analyze
its cellular location, double immunofluorescence staining was
used in equivalent sections. Our data show that seladin-1/
DHCR24 is mainly located in neurons (neuronal nuclei–positive) of both sham and MCAO-exposed animals. Interestingly,
we detected seladin-1/DHCR24 immunoreactivity in astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein -positive) after MCAO but
not in SHAM-operated animals (Figure 1B).

Infarct Volume Is Increased After Seladin-1/
DHCR24 Pharmacological Inhibition
The increased expression of seladin-1/DHCR24 observed
after experimental stroke moved us to test whether this
enzyme influences infarct volume in vivo. To this aim, we
studied the effect of the high-affinity–binding seladin-1/
DHCR24 inhibitor17 U18666A (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes after MCAO, on infarct
volume. Infarct lesion was determined 48 h after MCAO in
vehicle- and U18666A-treated mice. The treatment with 10
and 20 mg/kg U18666A but not with 5 mg/kg caused a significant increase in the infarct volume when compared with
the vehicle-treated group (n=6, P<0.05; Figure 2A). However,
the effect of U18666A (10 mg/kg) was no longer observed

Lipid Rafts Isolation
Mouse brains were obtained from peri-infarct area 24 h after ischemia and homogenized in phosphate buffer saline containing 9% sucrose and protease inhibitors (pepstatin, antipain, chymostatin, each
at a final concentration of 25 mg/mL) using 20 strokes in a dounce
homogenizer on ice. The samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at
4°C and 700 g, and the supernatants considered as total extracts. A
further centrifugation of the supernatant was performed at 100 000 g
for 1 h at 4°C to pellet the membrane fraction. Protein concentration
was quantified by the detergent compatible method (Bio-Rad).
The homogenates were then incubated with Tris-NaCl-EDTA
(TNE)-Triton X-100 (Tris-HCl 50 mmol/L, pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mmol/L,
EDTA 5 mmol/L, and protease inhibitors) for 40 minutes at 4°C in rotation and centrifuged at 11 752 g for 3 minutes. The supernatant was
then placed in a centrifuge tube mixed with 80% sucrose prepared in
TNE buffer (final concentration 60%). The samples were overlaid with
35% and 5% sucrose, respectively. The gradient was centrifuged for
19 h at 100 000 g at 4°C. Nine fractions, 1 mL each sample, were collected from the top of each tube, and lipid raft fractions were identified
by the presence of the lipid raft marker, flotillin-1.

Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as mean±SD for the indicated number of experiments. Prism5 (GraphPad Software, Inc, La Jolla, CA) was used
for statistical analysis. Unpaired Student’s t test was used to compare
2 groups. One- or 2-way ANOVA was used to compare >2 groups
or parameters with the Tukey and Bonferroni post hoc tests, respectively. Values of P<0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Haploinsufficiency of Seladin-1/DHCR24 Worsens
Stroke Outcome and Brain Inflammation

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

To confirm the role of endogenous seladin-1/DHCR24 in cerebral ischemia, 2-month-old Dhcr24+/− and WT mice were subjected to MCAO and euthanized 48 h after. In agreement with
the data obtained with the DHCR24 inhibitor, our data show
that the size of the ischemic lesion was significantly higher
in Dhcr24+/− than in WT mice (n=9–6 respectively, P<0.05,
Figure 2B) suggesting that endogenous seladin-1/DHCR24
plays a protective role during cerebral ischemia.
To assess whether seladin-1/DHCR24 deficiency had an
effect not only in infarct volume but also in functional deficits, we monitored motor abilities by using the walking test
(normal=0, maximum=3) in WT and Dhcr24+/− mice before
killing, 48 h after MCAO. The score of WT mice was significantly lower than that in Dhcr24+/− animals, indicating a better
performance in mice with a normal expression of seladin-1/
DHCR24 (Figure 2C).
As an additional parameter of brain damage, we also
analyzed the expression of inflammatory mediators in brain
homogenates from peri-infarct tissue of MCAO-injured mice
24 h after the surgery. Both, proinflammatory mediators,
such as iNOS, COX-2, and tumor necrosis factor-α and antiinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-10 showed higher
levels (n=7, P<0.05; Figure 3) in Dhcr24+/− mice when compared with their WT littermates. This indicates exacerbated

stress response, resulting in pro and anti-inflammatory
activities after experimental ischemia in Dhcr24+/− animals.
Physiological parameters measured in arterial blood 10 minutes before and 30 minutes after MCAO were not affected by
the partial deletion of seladin-1/DHCR24 in Dhcr24+/− mice
(n=6; Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).

Seladin-1/DHCR24 Deficiency Decreases Cellular
EAAT2 Levels and Lipid Rafts Location in PeriInfarct Region
Excitotoxicity because of glutamate increase in brain after
cerebral ischemia contributes to infarct lesion. A key molecule
in this event is the glutamate transporter EAAT2, whose association to lipid rafts where it is more active increases after ischemic injury. It has been shown that seladin-1/DHCR24 alters
raft partitioning of certain molecules. To ascertain whether
seladin-1/DHCR24 deficiency affects EAAT2 association to
lipid rafts in our model, homogenates from peri-infarct area of
ipsilesional cortices from WT and Dhcr24+/− mice were subjected to a discontinuous sucrose gradient in the presence of
detergent, and 9 fractions were collected from the top of the
gradient (fractions 1–9) according to their density. Flotillin-1,
a canonical marker of lipid rafts,23 was found mainly in fractions 3 to 5 from MCAO-WT mice (n=5, P<0.05; Figure 4A);
consistent with the association of EAAT2 to these membrane
domains, most of the protein (70%) colocalized with flotillin-1 in these fractions. In contrast, in Dhcr24+/− mice, both
flotillin-1 and EAAT2 were displaced to non-raft fractions 7 to
9 (≈50% flotillin-1 and 85% EAAT2; Figure 4A).

In addition, our results also show a significant decrease
(≈25%) in total EAAT2 protein levels in Dhcr24+/− animals
24 h after MCAO (n=8, P<0.05; Figure 4B).
Pharmacological inhibition of seladin-1/DHCR24 induces
a decrease in glutamate uptake in astrocytes and in EAAT2
association with lipid rafts in peri-infarct area
To determine whether the loss of EAAT2 association
to lipid rafts found in Dhcr24+/− mice has functional consequences on this transporter, we monitored first the effect of
seladin-1/DHCR24 inhibition on the uptake of 3H-glutamate
in cultured astrocytes. To this aim, we used mouse astrocytic
cultures after treatment with U18666A at different concentrations (2.5, 5, and 10 μg/mL) or with vehicle during 48 h. Our
results show a decrease in glutamate uptake after treatment
with U18666A at all the concentrations studied (n=5, P<0.05;
Figure 5A), confirming that DHCR24 inhibition affects
EAAT2 function. To determine whether this correlates with an
altered membrane distribution of this glutamate transporter, we
assessed the presence of EAAT2 in lipid rafts after pharmacological inhibition of seladin-1/DHCR24 in vivo. Homogenates
from peri-infarct area from vehicle- and U18666A (10 mg/
kg)-treated mice were subjected to a discontinuous sucrose
gradient in the presence of detergent as described previously.
Although flotillin-1 and EAAT2 mainly localize in raft fractions 3-4-5 in vehicle-treated animals, the pharmacological
inhibition of seladin-1/DHCR24 resulted in the displacement of both flotillin-1 and EAAT2 to non-raft fractions (7–9;

≈70% both flotillin-1 and EAAT2; n=5, P<0.05; Figure 5B).
This behavior is similar to that observed in Dhcr24+/− mice
(see Figure 4A).

Discussion
The presence of seladin-1/DHCR24 in central nervous system
has been reported in many studies where seladin-1/DHCR24
has been shown to play an important role in neuroprotection.24
In brain and other tissues, several authors have described the
implication of seladin-1/DHCR24 in different processes like
apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration.1,3,5,8,25 We hereby demonstrate for the first time the protective role of seladin-1/DHCR24 against experimental stroke
induced by MCAO in mice.
First, we have found that exposure to MCAO induces
an overexpression of seladin-1/DHCR24 protein in mouse
brain early after the ischemic occlusion that was maintained
even 7 days thereafter, suggesting that seladin-1/DHCR24
might play a role in ischemic stroke. To ascertain this issue,
we first performed pharmacological loss-of-function experiments using U18666A, an inhibitor of seladin-1/DHCR24
enzymatic activity,16 showing that DHCR24 inhibition is associated to an increase in the infarct volume and strongly supporting a protective role of endogenous seladin-1/DHCR24
in cerebral ischemia. To confirm these data, we explored
the effect of DHCR24 haploinsufficiency using Dhcr24+/−
mice. Importantly, Dhcr24+/− animals presented larger infarct

volumes and worse motor outcome than their WT littermates.
In addition, our results show a significant increase in inflammatory response after ischemia in Dhcr24+/− compared with
their WT littermates, as demonstrated by increased levels of
the inflammation-related markers COX-2, iNOS, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-10, which participate in the ischemic inflammatory cascade and in the subsequent ischemic
brain damage.26 Altogether, these results confirm the neuroprotective role of seladin-1/DHCR24 in cerebral ischemia.
Ischemia initiates with severe focal hypoperfusion that
leads to excitotoxicity and oxidative damage which, in turn,
initiate postischemic inflammation that contribute to brain
injury and to the expansion of the ischemic lesion.27 We
and others have previously shown that glutamate increases
in brain after cerebral ischemia in this permanent MCAO
model28–30 and that strategies that diminish extracellular
glutamate levels could ameliorate the symptoms in rats.31–33
In this context, glutamate uptake by glutamate transporters play a major role; specifically, EAAT2 or GLT1, that
is predominantly located in astrocytes, has been reported
to account for ≈95% of glutamate uptake in the adult
central nervous system.34 Interestingly, this transporter
needs to be associated to lipid rafts for a proper cellular
function,11 an association that is increased after ischemic
injury.32 Our results show an increase in seladin-1/DHCR24
expression in astrocytes after MCAO that could constitute
a stress-response aimed to increase EAAT2 association to
lipid rafts. Further studies are necessary to discriminate
the role of astrocytes and neurons in this setting. Because
seladin-1/DHCR24, by regulating cholesterol biosynthesis,
has a crucial role in the correct function of these microdomains,3 we reasoned that the absence or inhibition of this
enzyme might have a major impact on glutamate levels and
subsequent excitotoxicity after brain ischemia. Indeed, our
results show that the association of EAAT2 to lipid rafts
was lower in Dhcr24+/− animals in comparison with WT
mice after ischemia. The same effect was observed when
seladin-1/DHCR24 was inhibited pharmacologically with
the inhibitor U18666A. These results support the idea that
the decrease in seladin-1/DHCR24 alter lipid rafts and thus
impede a correct association of EAAT2 to these platforms
that may lead to a decrease in glutamate uptake and subsequent excitotoxicity in Dhcr24+/−. Supporting this idea,
our results demonstrate that glutamate uptake is markedly
decreased when DHCR24 activity is inhibited in astrocytic
cultures, confirming the involvement of seladin-1/DHCR24
at this level. We also found that the expression of EAAT2
is significantly lower in heterozygous mice, suggesting that
the altered association of this protein to lipid rafts may be
indirectly affecting its synthesis or degradation. Finally, our
data show that the action of seladin-1/DHCR24 takes place
in the first hours after the ischemic onset, supporting excitotoxicity as the target of the beneficial actions of this protein
after stroke. However, because several important cellular
functions are exerted by other proteins associated to lipid
rafts, we cannot discard the involvement of other mechanisms in the effect of seladin-1/DHCR24 in the ischemic
scenario.

Summary
In summary, this is the first report showing that seladin-1/
DHCR24 has a neuroprotective role against cerebral ischemia
in mice. Decreased levels of this protein exacerbate the inflammatory response and cell death after ischemia. Our results suggest that these effects are caused by excitotoxicity mediated by
a failed glutamate uptake caused by a decrease in the association of EAAT2 to lipid rafts. Importantly, because seladin-1/
DHCR24-deficient mice recapitulate brain lipidic changes typical of aging, our findings also suggest important mechanisms
that explain increased vulnerability of the aged brain to stroke.
Our results open a new line of investigation aimed to design
therapeutic strategies that increase seladin-1/DHCR24 expression or activity for a correct functioning of EAAT2 and other
important proteins associated to lipid rafts. These strategies
may be beneficial to improve the outcome of stroke and also of
other pathologies in which seladin-1/DHCR24 deficiency has
been reported like Alzheimer’s disease.
