SUMMARY
Ligands of the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) have
demonstrated rapid anxiolytic efﬁcacy in stress responses and
stress-related disorders. This protein is involved in the synthesis of endogenous neurosteroids including pregnenolone,
dehydroepiandrosterone, and progesterone. These neurosteroids promote c-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurotransmission in the central neural system (CNS). A TSPO ligand,
N-benzyl-N-ethyl-2-(7,8-dihydro-7-benzyl-8-oxo-2-phenyl-9Hpurin-9-yl) acetamide (ZBD-2) was recently synthesized. The
purpose of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of ZBD-2 and. In cultured cortical neurons,
treatment with ZBD-2 attenuated excitotoxicity induced by
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) exposure. It signiﬁcantly
decreased the number of apoptotic cells by downregulating
GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors (NMDARs), the ratio of
Bax/Bcl-2, and levels of pro-caspase-3. Systemic treatment of
ZBD-2 provided signiﬁcant neuroprotection in mice subjected
to middle cerebral artery occlusion. These ﬁndings provide
direct evidence that neuroprotection by ZBD-2 is partially
mediated by inhibiting GluN2B-containing NMDA receptormediated excitotoxicity.

INTRODUCTION
The translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) was initially identiﬁed
as a peripheral binding site for diazepam, and later distinguished
functionally and structurally from the central benzodiazepine
receptor.1 TSPO is located primarily in the outer mitochondrial
membrane in peripheral tissues and the central neural system
(CNS), and is not linked to the GABAA receptor.2 TSPO plays a

crucial role in the synthesis of neurosteroids by promoting transport of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, which
is the rate-limiting step in neurosteroidogenesis.3 For example,
TSPO regulates the synthesis of pregnenolone from cholesterol.1
Progesterone is the main precursor molecule for 3a-pregnane
neuroactive steroids. At the molecular level, progesterone activates intracellular progesterone receptors.4 Ligands of TSPO such
as XBD173, YL-IPA08, and AC-5216 exert anxiolytic and
antidepressant effects in animal models.5–7 It has been suggested
that TSPO is expressed in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons.8,9
Upregulation of TSPO is observed in response to injury and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease,
Alzheimer’s disease, and stroke.10
Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS.
Excessive release of glutamate induces cell death through excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, or both, which lead to neuroﬁbrillary
tangles and neuronal cell death.11 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors
(NMDARs) have recently attracted considerable attention because
of their roles in synaptic plasticity and excitotoxicity. Glutamate
is present in millimolar concentrations in central gray matter, and
glutamate release triggers postsynaptic responses via pharmacologically and functionally distinct metabotropic and ionotropic
receptors, which allow calcium (Ca2+) inﬂux. The accumulation
of Ca2+, together with Ca2+ release from intracellular compartments, can overwhelm Ca2+-regulatory mechanisms and lead to
cytoxicity.12 Differences in NMDAR subunit composition account
for neuronal survival or death. It has been suggested that the
GluN2A-subunit, which is found primarily at synapses, is required
for glutamate-mediated neuronal survival. The GluN2B-subunit,
which is found primarily at extrasynaptic sites, is required for glutamate-mediated neuronal death. Indeed, excitotoxicity is triggered
by selective activation of GluN2B-containing NMDARs.13 It has
been reported that TSPO is a novel target for neuroprotective
treatments that aim to reduce microglial activation.14 However, little is known about the function of TSPO in glutamate-mediated
excitotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms.
The authors recently synthesized N-benzyl-N-ethyl-2(7,8-dihydro-7-benzyl-8-oxo-2-phenyl-9H-purin-9-yl) acetamide
(ZBD-2) (Fig. 1), which is a novel TSPO ligand that exhibits

effects of ZBD-2 were related to the regulation of the balance
between excitatory and inhibitory transmissions in the basal lateral amygdala (BLA).15 This study aimed to investigate the possible protective efﬁcacy of ZBD-2 on focal cerebral ischemia
and against NMDA-induced cell apoptosis in primary cultures
of mouse cortical neurons.

with fragmented nuclei (Fig. 2a). The results demonstrated that
8.0  1.4% of the cells in the control group underwent apoptosis
compared with 35.8  2.5% of the cells in the NMDA injury
group (Fig. 2b). The number of apoptotic cells after ZBD-2
treatment (1, 10 lmol/L) was signiﬁcantly decreased following
exposure to NMDA (Fig. 2a,b). These data further indicate that
ZBD-2 protects neurons against NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity.

Neuroprotective effects of ZBD-2 against NMDA-induced cell

To conﬁrm further the neuroprotective effects of ZBD-2, apoptotic and viable nuclei were visualized using Hoechst 33258 and
PI double staining. Hoechst 33258 and PI emit blue and red
ﬂuorescence, respectively, when bound to double-stranded
DNA. Viable cells exhibit regular, round nuclei with light blue

Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to induce
cerebral ischemia by occlusion of the ipsilateral middle cerebral
artery (MCA) for 120 min before reperfusion. MCAO resulted in
large infarcts in the brain (Fig. 3a). ZBD-2 treatment (0.75, 1.5,
3 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly decreased infarct volume in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile, a Zea Longa test showed that
ZBD-2 clearly reversed the neurological deﬁcit score in MCAO
mice (Fig. 3c).
Nissl staining revealed neuronal damage in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampal CA1 region after MCAO.16 The injured
neurons showed shrunken cell bodies accompanied by shrunken
and pyknotic nuclei (Fig. 4a). The number of normal neurons
after MCAO decreased to 17.2  4.6% and 22.2  2.3% in the
prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, respectively (Fig. 4b,c).
ZBD-2 (0.75, 1.5, 3.0 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly reduced neuronal
damage and preserved morphology as shown by increases in the
number of normal neurons in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 4b,c).

Effects of ZBD-2 on the expression of GluN2A- and GluN2Bcontaining NMDARs
The GluN2A subunit is found primarily at synapses and is
required for glutamate-mediated neuronal survival. In contrast,
the GluN2B subunit is found primarily at extrasynaptic sites and
is required for glutamate-mediated neuronal death.17–19 Thus,
blockade of GluN2B-containing NMDARs promotes neuronal
survival, and exerts a protective effect against NMDAR-mediated
neuronal damage.17–19 We examined the effects of ZBD-2 on the
expression of NMDAR subtypes in primary neuronal cultures.
After exposure to NMDA, levels of the GluN2B receptor notably
increased, whereas the level of the GluN2A subtype was
unchanged (Fig. 5). Pretreatment with ZBD-2 (1, 10 lmol/L) signiﬁcantly inhibited NMDA-induced upregulation of the GluN2B
subtype (Fig. 5b), but did not affect levels of the GluN2A subtype (Fig. 5c). Thus, downregulation of GluN2B-subunit levels
by ZBD-2 may subserve a neuroprotective effect against NMDAinduced excitotoxicity.
Effects of ZBD-2 on Bcl-2, Bax, and pro-caspase-3 expression
To conﬁrm further the possible relationship between NMDA-induced cell death and potential intracellular mediators, levels of
the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the pro-apoptotic precursor

proteins Bax and procaspase-3 were measured by Western blot
assay. The ratio between Bcl-2 and Bax determines the susceptibility of cells to death signalling.20 Furthermore, high procaspase-3 (the inactive precursor of caspase-3) levels indicate low
apoptotic activity.12 Levels of Bax were signiﬁcantly higher in
cells treated with NMDA than in control (untreated) cells
(Fig. 6a,b). In contrast, levels of Bcl-2 and pro-caspase-3 were
signiﬁcantly lower in cells treated with NMDA (Fig. 6c,d). ZBD2 treatment (0.2, 1, 10 lmol/L) showed anti-apoptotic activity by
notably decreasing the levels of Bax (Fig. 6b) and increasing the
levels of Bcl-2 and pro-caspase-3 (Fig. 6c,d).

DISCUSSION
Previous reports have shown that excitotoxicity and prolonged
microglial activation are involved in neuronal death in neurodegenerative disorders.14 TSPO is a novel target for neuroprotective
treatments that aim to reduce microglial activation.14 XBD173
(AC-5216, emapunil), which has recently been investigated for
the treatment of anxiety disorders,5, 21 is a phenylpurine with
high and rather selective afﬁnity for TSPO. In the present study,
we demonstrated that ZBD-2, an analogue of XBD173, increased
cell viability and attenuated apoptotic cells by inhibiting
GluN2B-containing NMDARs, decreasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio,
and upregulating pro-caspase-3. These ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst
evidence that ZBD-2 may act directly on neurons and protect
them from excitotoxicity insult, and partially reveal mechanisms
underlying the role of TSPO in preventing neuronal apoptosis.

cascade of events leading to neuronal injury and death after
ischemia includes the release of free radicals, inﬂammation, apoptosis, and excitotoxicity. In particular, free radicals generated during ischemia play an important role in neuronal damage.22 In
addition, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity has been recognized
as one of the major factors in pathogenesis of ischemic stroke.23
Our ﬁndings indicate that ZBD-2 can reduce infarct volume, and
improve the neurological deﬁcit score as well as neuronal morphology in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in mice with
MCAO. ZBD-2 may hold promise as a neuroprotective agent for
aging-related diseases such as acute ischemic stroke.
Mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic death through the release of
cytochrome C is regulated by TSPO, and increased expression of
this protein is observed in both elderly people and in patients
with Alzheimer’s disease.24 TSPO can increase steroid synthesis,
which leads to inhibition of inﬂammation and release of apoptotic
factors, thereby decreasing cell damage and promoting cell survival. A recent study indicates that efﬁcacy of TSPO ligands in
the stimulation of neurosteroid synthesis, thereby leading to anxiolytic effects, cannot be inferred from binding afﬁnity to TSPO.25
Our recent study also indicates that ZBD-2 has a high afﬁnity for
TSPO, and activation of TSPO by ZBD-2 attenuates chronic
pain-induced anxiety-like behaviours by regulating the balance
between GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission in the basal
lateral amygdala of mice.15
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors have recently attracted considerable attention because of their roles in synaptic plasticity and
excitotoxicity.26 GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDARs are
linked to different intracellular cascades and have distinct roles
in cell survival and excitotoxicity. Studies have shown that

pathological activation of NMDARs contributes to neuronal death
after acute excitotoxic trauma and acts as a major mediator.27
The GluN2A-subunit is primarily found at synapses and is
required for glutamate-mediated neuronal survival, whereas the
GluN2B-subunit is primarily found at extrasynaptic sites and is
required for glutamate-mediated neuronal death.28 The present
study showed that ZBD-2 reversed NMDA-induced upregulation
of GluN2B, suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of TSPO
likely alter the function of NMDARs. This phenomenon may
prove beneﬁcial for neurodegenerative diseases associated with
glutamate excitotoxicity.
A previous study has shown that several proteins can inﬂuence
or determine the progression of mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 in the outer mitochondrial
membrane promotes cell survival.20 During the initiation phase of
apoptosis, the pro-apoptotic factor Bax translocates from the
cytoplasm to the mitochondria and increases mitochondrial membrane permeability.29 An increase in the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein has been shown to be responsible for excitotoxic apoptosis
and death mediated by NMDARs in neurons.30 Caspases are a
family of cysteine proteases that are responsible for modulating
cell death. Caspase-3 is one of the main executors of apoptosis
and plays an essential role in neuronal apoptosis.31 Moreover,
increased mitochondrial permeability can trigger the release of
cytochrome C from the mitochondria to the cytosol, leading to
activation of caspase-9 and subsequent activation of caspase-3.32
Our data revealed that the Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio increased following treatment with NMDA, but it did not increase following
pretreatment with ZBD-2. Moreover, levels of pro-caspase-3
decreased in neurons after NMDA exposure, whereas levels of
pro-caspase-3 increased markedly after administration of ZBD-2.

In conclusion, ZBD-2 shows neuroprotective effects against
focal cerebral ischemia and NMDA-induced cell apoptosis. ZBD2 exerts its effect, at least in part, by inhibiting apoptosis evoked
by overactivation of GluN2B-containing NMDARs. These ﬁndings reveal potential molecular mechanisms underlying TSPO
neuroprotection and provide further insights into the neuroprotective functions of ZBD-2, as well as other TSPO ligands. TSPO
may be a highly valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of
neurodegenerative disorders.

METHODS
Chemicals and reagents
Neurobasal medium, B27 supplement, and glutamine were provided by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Anti-pro-caspase-3,
anti-pERK1/2, anti-GluN2A, anti-GluN2B, anti-Bax, and antiBcl-2 antibodies were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA,
USA). Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM) was purchased from Hyclone (Logan, UT, USA). Secondary antibodies
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). M-PER
protein extraction buffer and enhanced chemiluminescent solution
(ECL) were obtained from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA). All of
the other chemicals and reagents were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and were of standard commercially available biochemical quality.
Primary cortical neuron culture
Dissociated cortical neurons were prepared from the C57BL/6J
mice (embryonic, 15-day-old mice of both genders). The brain
was obtained aseptically from C57BL/6J mouse after craniotomy.
After removal of the meninges and blood vessels, a part of the
cerebral cortex was cut into pieces and digested in 0.125% trypsin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 15 min. Samples were agitated with
a pipette, centrifuged at 11.1 9 g for 5 min, and ﬁltered. The
supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended with
microglia medium (DMEM/F12 medium; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (Gibco) (Gibico, Mountain
View, CA, USA), 1 U/mL penicillin and 100 lg/mL streptomycin. The cell suspension was incubated in either 24-well plates
containing glass coverslips (Fisher Scientiﬁc, Loughborough,
UK), six-well plate, or 96-well plates precoated with 50 lg/ml
poly-D-lysine (Sigma) in water at 37 °C, 5% CO2. On the second
day, the medium was replaced once with Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 and 2 mmol/L GlutaMax (Invitrogen). From then on, half of the medium was replaced every
3 days. The cells were characterized by immunohistochemistry
staining for anti-MAP2 antibody, revealing that this culture procedure yields more than 95% neurons. Neurons were cultured for
10 days (DIV 10) before treatment. To detect the protective
effects of ZBD-2, the cultures were pretreated with ZBD-2 for
24 h. NMDA (200 lmol/L) and glycine (20 lmol/L) were simultaneously added to the same medium with the ZBD-2 for another
30 min. The cells were washed twice and returned to the original
culture medium for another 24 h. The experimental protocol used
in the present study was approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University.

Cell viability analysis
Cortical neurons were seeded in a 96-well plate (1 9 104 cells/
well) for 10 days before exposed to NMDA (200 lmol/L) and
glycine (20 lmol/L) for 30 min in the presence of the ZBD-2 at
0.2, 1, 10 lmol/L for 24 h. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was dissolved in DMEM and
added to each well at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. After
incubating for 4 h at 37 °C, the media was removed carefully,
and 150 mL DMSO was added into each well to dissolve the
MTT product formazan. The absorbance of formazan was
detected by a Universal Microplate Reader (Elx 800, Bio-TEK
Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA) at 570 nm (630 nm as a reference). Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of the control
value.

Hoechst /PI double staining
After the excitotoxic injury, PI and Hoechst 33258 double ﬂuorescent staining were added to the medium and incubated at
37 °C for 15 min and then the cells were ﬁxed by 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min for determining apoptotic cell
death.33 Fluorescence images were obtained with an inverted
ﬂuorescence microscope (Olympus BX61; Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan). Apoptotic and viable cells (3 9 105 each well) were
counted blindly and the percentage of apoptotic neurons was
calculated, i.e., apoptotic rate = apoptotic cells/(apoptotic cells
+ viable cells) 9 100%. Four separate experiments were
performed. For each well, six visual ﬁelds were selected
randomly.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was carried out as
previously described.34 Adult male C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg) through intraperitoneal injection. After isolation of the left common carotid
artery, external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery
(ICA), a silicone-coated 6-0 suture was gently inserted into the
ICA and stopped at the opening of the middle cerebral artery
(MCA). Reperfusion was performed 120 min after MCAO with
suture withdrawal. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0–
37.5 °C by surface heating and cooling. Brain infarct volumes
were evaluated at 24 h. Animals were randomly assigned to
ﬁve groups: sham, MCAO, and ZBD-2 (0.75, 1.5, 3.0 mg/kg).
Sham-operated mice underwent the same procedure without
the insertion of the suture into the ICA. Vehicle or drugs
were fed once daily for seven consecutive days before the
experiment.

Neurobehavioral evaluation
Neurobehavioral evaluation was performed in each group (n = 6)
at 24 h after reperfusion using a scoring system based on the Zea
Longa test.35 Neurological evaluation was scored using a ﬁve
point scale: 0, normal; 1, marked failure to extend left forepaw;
2, circling to the left fully; 3, marked inability to bear weight on
the left; 4, no spontaneous walking with depressed level of consciousness.

Infarct volume assessment
After neurological evaluation, the mice were re-anesthetized and
decapitated. Coronal sections (1 mm) were stained by immersion
in 2% TTC at 37 °C and ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin overnight. Unstained areas were deﬁned as infarct and the infarct volume was calculated by measuring the unstained area in each
slice, multiplying it by slice thickness (1 mm), and then summing
all six slices.

Young Scientists (81325022).

Nissl staining
Brain sections were exposed to the Nissl stain for the assessment
of neuronal cell loss at the dorsal hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex. Mice were deeply anaesthetized and then transcardially
perfused with cold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS (0.1 mol/L; pH 7.4). After post-ﬁxation, brains were
removed, washed in PBS, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in
PBS, and frozen in powdered dry ice. Coronal sections (30 lm)
were cut at the level of the dorsal hippocampus (3.3–4.0 mm posterior from the bregma) with a cryostat. Every fourth section was
collected and stained with cresyl violet for 20 min. For Nissl
staining, the sections were mounted on slides, dehydrated and
rehydrated in graded ethanols and xylenes respectively, and then
incubated in 1% cresyl violet for 30 s. Sections were then decolorized in acetic acid, dehydrated, and coverslipped with Permount.
Sections were observed with a binocular microscope (Olympus).

Western blot analysis
Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS lysed by M-PER protein extraction buffer containing 1 9 protease inhibitor cocktail
and scraped from the wells. Supernatants were collected and protein concentration was determined by a BCA Kit with bovine
serum albumin (BSA) as standard. Following heating at 95° for
10 min, 50 lg protein was loaded and fractionated by 9%
sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS–PAGE). Proteins were then electrotransferred onto
polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PDVF) membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked with either 5% non-fat dry milk or 5% BSA
in PBS-Tween 20 (PBST) 0.1%, and then incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-GluN2A (1 : 1000), anti-GluN2B
(1 : 1000), anti-Bcl-2 (dilution ratio 1 : 500), anti-Bax (dilution
ratio 1 : 500), pERK1/2 (dilution ratio, 1 : 200), ERK1/2 (dilution ratio, 1 : 400), pro-caspase-3 (dilution ratio, 1 : 400), and
b-actin (dilution ratio 1 : 10 000) as an internal control, diluted
in blocking buffer for 16–20 h at 4 °C. Membranes were then
washed with 0.1% PBST and the bound antibodies were detected
by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat
anti-rabbit 1 : 10 000 or goat anti-mouse 1 : 10 000) diluted in
blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The density of the
bands was quantiﬁed using ECL and IMAGE J program (Waltham,
MA, USA).
