Abstract The Chinese herbal medicine formula Tao
Hong Si Wu decoction (THSWD) is traditionally used for
the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke. Transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates a
battery of phase II enzymes and is known as the major
mechanism of cellular defense against oxidative stress. The
present study aimed to explore the potential effect of
THSWD on the Nrf2 signaling pathway and the consequent
effect during cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury.
We found that THSWD reduced infarct volume and
improved neurological function in a rat stroke model
induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
Additionally, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), a key endogenous
antioxidant enzyme regulated by Nrf2, was significantly
further induced by THSWD in this in vivo model. In neuronal-like PC12 cells, THSWD remarkably up-regulated
HO-1 expression and promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation.
Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt

kinase was found to be involved in the upstream of Nrf2
regulation. In an in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/
reperfusion (OGD-Rep) model, THSWD treatment significantly reduced cell death induced by OGD-Rep insult.
Importantly, the protective action was attenuated while
PI3K activity was inhibited by a specific inhibitor,
LY294002, and the Nrf2 signaling pathway was blocked by
antioxidant response element (ARE) decoy oligonucleotides. Collectively, these results demonstrated that THSWD
exhibited notable neuroprotective properties in vitro and
in vivo and activation of PI3K/Akt and the Nrf2 signaling
pathway may be, at least in part, responsible for the protection. This study provides a better understanding of the
molecular mechanism underlying the traditional use of the
Chinese herbal medicine formula THSWD.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is one of the major causes of morbidity and
mortality in most countries. Increasing evidence shows that
oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of
ischemic stroke, as the brain is deemed highly susceptible to
oxidative stress due to a large amount of body oxygen, a
relatively poor antioxidant defense system and a high concentration of readily pro-oxidant molecules [1]. Oxidative
stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated
during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) easily leads
to neuronal cell death and consequent brain damage [2, 3].
Therefore, antioxidant therapies have received considerable
interest in the treatment of I/R-induced damage.

J Nat Med (2015) 69:76–85

The transcription factor NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is
responsible for regulating a battery of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes, primarily in response to oxidative stress
[4]. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is inactivated by kelchlike ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) via forming a
covalent complex. Once activated, Nrf2 translocates into
the cell nucleus and binds to the antioxidant responsive
element (ARE), a key regulatory element in the promoter
region of genes encoding cellular anti-oxidative phase II
enzymes including heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1),
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL), etc. [4, 5]. A panel of neuroprotectants has been shown to enhance the cellular
tolerance against I/R-induced oxidative insults via the
activation of Nrf2 [6–8]. Thus, the Nrf2 signaling pathway
has received particular attention as a novel molecular target
for pharmacological intervention of ischemic diseases [9].
The Chinese herbal medicine formula Tao Hong Si Wu
decoction (THSWD) was first described in a well-known
medical book Yi Zong Jin Jian in 1742 (Qing Dynasty of
China). It is believed to originate from Si Wu decoction
(SWD) formula, which is composed of four medicinal herbs,
Radix Rehmanniae Praeparata, Radix Angelicae Sinensis,
Rhizoma Ligustici Chuanxiong and Radix Paeoniae Alba
[10]. THSWD is formed when Semen Prunus and Flos
Carthami Tinctorii are added to the SWD. In addition, Radix
Paeoniae Alba is replaced by Radix Paeoniae Rubra. SWD
has been used in China for the relief of menstrual discomfort,
climacteric syndrome and other estrogen-related diseases
[10], whereas THSWD has preferably been used for the
treatment of cerebrovascular diseases after changing its
composition from SWD [11, 12]. A previous study revealed
that THSWD exhibited neuroprotective activity against
cerebral I/R-induced injury with the inhibition of HIF-1a and
TNF-a activation as possible mechanism [13]. A recent
microarray study showed that the expression of genes in the
Nrf2 cytoprotective pathway was significantly affected by
SWD in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells, which is believed
to be related to its health benefits for female estrogen-related
diseases [14]. In view of this, we have designed this investigation to explore the potential effect of THSWD on the
Nrf2 pathway and the consequent cytoprotective effect
during cerebral I/R injury in vitro and in vivo (Table 1).

Technology (Boston, MA, USA). Other chemicals were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA)
unless indicated otherwise.
Botanical extracts preparation and HPLC chromatogram
of THSWD are described in Supplementary Materials.
Animals and I/R model in vivo
Sprague–Dawley male (230–260 g) rats were offered by
the Institute of Laboratory Animals, Sichuan Academy of
Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital. All procedures were approved according to the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Sichuan Academy of Medical
Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital and the
Sichuan Province Animal Care Ethics Committee. To test
the potential protective effect against the damage induced
by I/R, THSWD was administered by oral gavage at a dose
of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg/day for 7 days, respectively. Volume-matched vehicle was given to rats in the sham group.
Nimodipine in 0.5 % sodium carboxymethylcellulose
solution was used as a positive control and administrated
by oral gavage once at a dose of 12 mg/kg at 1 h prior to
onset of the ischemia. Middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO)-induced focal cerebral ischemia was performed
as described previously [15]. Briefly, rats were anesthetized
with 7 % chloral hydrate intraperitoneally at a dose of
350 mg/kg and body temperature was maintained at 37 °C.
The MCA of the right side was occluded by gently
advancing a 4-0 silicon-coated monofilament nylon suture
with a round tip. Reperfusion was introduced by withdrawing the monofilament after 2 h of occlusion. Sham
surgeries were performed in the same way, except that the
filament was not advanced to the origin of the MCA.

Chemicals and antibodies
HO-1 antibody was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences
(NY, USA). The antibodies against Nrf2 and Lamin b were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA). The
antibodies against b-actin and rabbit IgG were purchased

Measurement of infarct volume and neurological
function
At 24 h after ischemia, brains were immediately removed,
rinsed in cold saline solution and sliced into 5 9 2-mm

123

78

thick coronal sections. The sections were immediately
stained with 0.5 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by 4 % formaldehyde
solution overnight. Infarct volume was then measured as
described previously [16, 17]. The infarct volume was
expressed as a percentage of the volume of the contralateral
structure for correcting the brain swelling.
Neurological evaluations were blindly performed
according to the scoring system of Garcia et al. [18] prior
to and 24 h after MCAO. This 18-point scale includes the
following six tests—spontaneous activity, symmetry of
movements, symmetry of forelimbs, climbing, reaction to
touch on either side of trunk, and response to vibrissae
touch. All tests were scored individually and added together to obtain a neurological score ranging from 3-18 with
higher scores indicating less disability.
Cell culture
Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were obtained from the
American Type Cell Culture Collection (Manassas, VA,
USA) and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10 % horse serum
(Invitrogen, USA), 5 % fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen,
USA), and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, USA)
on collagen I-coated dishes at 37 °C in a humidified 5 %
CO2 atmosphere.
Procedure for oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion
(OGD-Rep)
The in vitro I/R model was set up by OGD-Rep treatment
of PC12 cells as described previously [7]. Briefly, PC12
cells were first incubated in glucose-free DMEM and
subsequently transferred into a Tri-Gas incubator (Heal
Force, HF100) with 1 % O2, 94 % N2 and 5 % CO2 for 8 h
at 37 °C. Sham OGD cultures were maintained in a normal
oxygenated DMEM. Following OGD treatment, cells were
returned to the normoxic incubator with normal culture
medium and incubated for a further 18 h.
Measurement of cell viability
Cell viability was evaluated by a cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) which
is based on the conversion of a water-soluble tetrazolium salt, 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt
(WST-8), to a water-soluble formazan dye upon reduction
by dehydrogenases in the presence of an electron carrier
[19]. Briefly, at the end of drug treatment, cells were
washed and CCK-8 solution (10 ll) was added to each

123

well, followed by incubation for 3 h at 37 °C. The
absorbance at 450 nm was determined by a microplate
reader (Biotek, USA). Cell viability was expressed as a
percentage of that of the control (untreated) cells.
Preparation of total cellular, cytosolic and nuclear
proteins
The tissues in cerebral cortex or PC12 cells were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies, USA) supplemented with 1 % (v/v) protein inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The cell lysates were centrifuged
at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatants
were then collected as total proteins. Cytosolic and nuclear
extracts were isolated as described previously [7]. Briefly,
following 30 min incubation in ice-cold Buffer A (pH 8.0)
containing 20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N0 -2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl,
1 mM DTT, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM NaF,
1 mM PMSF and 1 % (v/v) protein inhibitor cocktail, the
cells were lysed by adding the appropriate volume of 10 %
(v/v) NP-40 to a final concentration of 0.625 % (v/v) and
vortexing. The cell lysates were separated to the supernatant as cytosolic extract and the nuclear pellet by centrifugation. The nuclear proteins were extracted from the
pellet in ice-cold Buffer C (pH 8.0) containing 20 mM
HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl,
1 mM DTT, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM NaF,
1 mM PMSF, 1 % (v/v) protein inhibitor cocktail and
20 % (v/v) glycerol). The concentration of the cellular
proteins was determined by Protein Assay Dye Reagent
Concentrate (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc, USA) using bovine
serum albumin as a standard.
Western blotting analysis
Protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting as
previously described [7, 20]. Briefly, thirty lg of the cellular proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 10 %
SDS–polyacrylamide gel, and subsequently transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Following 1 h incubation in a fresh TBS buffer containing 0.1 % Tween-20
and 5 % BSA, the blots were probed with specific antibodies including anti-HO-1, anti-b-actin, anti-phosphoAkt, anti-Nrf2 antibody or goat anti-lamin b1 antibody.
The bound primary antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-goat IgG
accordingly. The activity of peroxidase on the blot was
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (GE Healthcare, Sweden).

Immunohistochemical staining
Immunohistochemical staining for HO-1 was performed on
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded venous sections using a
method described previously [21]. Following antigen
retrieval, rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies for HO-1
(1:200, Enzo Life Sciences, USA) was employed along
with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit), biotinylated
conjugates and diaminobenzidine ordinally (Beyotime,
China). Hematoxylin was utilized for counterstaining. An
examiner blinded to the experiment groups counted the
cells labeled with HO-1 antibodies of 5 random regions in
ischemic hemisphere cortex under a light microscope at a
magnification of 9400.
Immunostaining of Nrf2 in cultured cells
The nuclear translocation of Nrf2 was determined by
immunostaining as previously described [7]. The monoclonal antibody recognizing Nrf2 was used. Cells were
cultured on collagen I coated-glass coverslips in complete
growth medium. After treatment, cells were washed three
times with PBS and fixed with paraformaldehyde (3.7 %).
After the removal of excessive paraformaldehyde, fixed
cells were incubated in a fresh blocking buffer (0.5 %
Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 10 % normal goat
serum) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then
incubated overnight at 4 °C on addition of anti-Nrf2 primary antibody solution (diluted 1:100 in PBS with 3 %
bovine serum albumin). The bound antibody was detected
by FITC-goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:1,000)
in PBS containing 3 % bovine serum albumin. The cell
nucleus was stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) (Invitrogen, USA). Images were captured on a
Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).
Decoy design and treatment
ARE decoy oligonucleotides (ODNs) were used in this
study to inhibit the Nrf2-driven gene according to a previous study [22]. Upper-strand and reverse-complement
phosphorothioated ODNs were commercially synthesized
and purified by Sangon Biotech Inc. (Shanghai, China).
Double-stranded decoy ODNs were prepared by annealing
complimentary single strands in sterile saline. In addition
to the ARE decoy ODNs, scrambled decoy ONDs (mut
ODNs) was used as control for specificity. The following
sequences used in these studies were ARE, 50 CTAATGGTGACAAAGCAACTTT-30 and its compliment; ARE mut, 50 -CGACTGCCTTCAAAATAACTTT-30
and its compliment. The underlining indicates the ARE
core binding sequence. To increase the delivery of ODNs

the largest effect. Meanwhile, the infarct volume in the
nimodipine group was also significantly smaller than that
in the vehicle-treated rats. These results demonstrated that
THSWD protected I/R-injured rat brain. Moreover, the
body weight of rats in the three THSWD groups did not
show any significant difference compared to that in the
sham group (data not shown).

All data are presented as mean ± SD for three independent
experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by two-tail
Student’s t test. A p value of \0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

Results

THSWD reduced neurological deficits after MCAO

THSWD reduced the infarct volume
We first investigated whether THSWD could protect the
brain against I/R induced damage. As shown in Fig. 1a, b,
THSWD in all groups (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 g/kg/day) significantly reduced the infarct volume compared with that in
the vehicle group, whereas 1.0 g/kg/day THSWD exhibited

Our neurological evaluations based on Garcia’s 18-point
scale test clearly showed that I/R induced a significant
decrease in neurological score, compared with that of rats
in the sham group. Pretreatment with 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 g/kg/
day THSWD significantly increased the neurological score
in I/R rats. However, the score in the 1.5 g/kg/day THSWD

J Nat Med (2015) 69:76–85

group was lower than in the 1.0 g/kg/day THSWD group.
As a positive control, nimodipine pretreatment also
increased the neurological score (Fig. 1c).

compared to vehicle alone, but did not reach significance
(p [ 0.05).

THSWD induced HO-1 protein expression in I/R rats

THSWD induced HO-1 protein expression
and promoted Nrf2 nuclear translocation in PC12 cells

To determine the potential influence of THSWD on the
Nrf2 signaling pathway in vivo, we analyzed HO-1
expression, a typical antioxidant and cytoprotective
downstream target protein of Nrf2, in cerebral cortex after
I/R. As shown in Fig. 2a, I/R induced a significant increase
of HO-1 expression compared with that in the sham group.
HO-1 expression further dose-dependently increased when
I/R rats were pre-treated with 0.5 and 1.0 g/kg/day
THSWD (p \ 0.001 for both). Pretreatment with 1.5 g/kg/
day THSWD also significantly increased HO-1 expression
in I/R rats (p \ 0.01), although the increase was less than
that induced by 0.5 and 1.0 g/kg/day THSWD. Additionally, nimodipine pretreatment also increased HO-1
expression of I/R rats (p \ 0.05).
To further confirm the effect of THSWD on HO-1 in I/R
rats, we performed immunohistochemical detection of HO1 in the cerebral cortex. In the sham-operated group, a few
cells stained by HO-1 were seen in the cortex. In the
vehicle control group, the number of cells stained by HO-1
increased. In agreement with Western blotting results, there
was an increase in the number of cells stained by HO-1 in
all THSWD-pretreated groups compared to vehicle alone.
A decrease in the number of cells stained by HO-1 was also
seen in the 1.5 g/kg/day THSWD group compared with
the1.0 g/kg/day THSWD group. Nimodipine pretreatment
also increased the number of cells stained by HO-1

To further characterize the effect of THSWD on the Nrf2
signaling pathway, we first conducted Western blotting to
analyze the inducing effect of THSWD on HO-1 in PC12
cells. In our previous experiment, THSWD did not show
toxicity up to a concentration of 2 mg ml-1 (data not
shown). In this study, we determined the effect of THSWD
at concentrations from 0-1.0 mg/ml. As a result, HO-1
induction was positively correlated with the concentration
of THSWD over the range of 0–1.0 mg/ml after 24 h
treatment (Fig. 3a). Our results also showed that THSWD
at a fixed concentration (1.0 mg/ml) induced HO-1 in a
time-dependent manner (Fig. 3b).
To investigate the potential molecular mechanism
leading to HO-1 induction, we examined the nuclear
translocation of Nrf2 in response to THSWD (Fig. 3c).
Nuclear proteins were isolated and analyzed by Western
blotting using anti-Nrf2 antibodies, whereas lamin b1 was
detected as a nuclear marker. The result showed that the
accumulation of Nrf2 proteins in the nucleus presented an
increasing trend over the THSWD (1.0 mg/ml) treatment
time of 0–6 h. Then, we further characterized the Nrf2
nuclear translocation by immunocytochemical staining
after treatment of PC12 cells with 1.0 mg/ml THSWD for
6 h. As shown in Fig. 3d, Nrf2 stained with FITC presented
mostly in the cytoplasm of untreated cells, whereas cells
treated with THSWD resulted in the appearance of FITC

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway
mediates Nrf2 activation by THSWD in PC12 cells
To identify the potential upstream protein kinases involved
in Nrf2 signaling pathway activation by THSWD, the
phosphorylation of Akt kinase induced by THSWD was
determined by Western blotting. Akt phosphorylation was

123

induced by THSWD (1.0 mg/ml) in a time-dependent
increase within 1 h, whereas the phosphorylated level of
Akt significantly decreased at the 3 and 6 h time points
(Fig. 4a), suggesting that PI3K/Akt kinase may play a role
in THSWD-stimulated Nrf2 activation. To further confirm
this deduction, LY294002, an inhibitor that specifically
blocks PI3K/Akt signaling was applied. As shown in
Fig. 4b, THSWD-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation was
effectively inhibited in the presence of LY294002
(20 lM). These results suggested that PI3K/Akt kinase
plays an important role in THSWD-induced activation of
the Nrf2 signaling pathway in PC12 cells.
Inhibition of PI3K/Akt and the Nrf2 signaling pathway
attenuated THSWD-mediated protection against OGDRep-induced injury in PC12 cells
We have confirmed that THSWD activated PI3K/Akt and
the Nrf2 pathway. To further determine the role of the Nrf2
pathway in THSWD-mediated protection against OGD-

J Nat Med (2015) 69:76–85

Rep-induced injury in an in vitro I/R model, we tested the
effect of THSWD in the presence and absence of PI3K
inhibitor or ARE decoy ODNs. As shown in Fig. 5a, both
0.5 and 1.0 mg/ml THSWD significantly protected PC12
cells against OGD-Rep-induced cell death (p \ 0.01). The
protective effect of 1.0 mg/ml THSWD significantly
decreased in the presence of 20 lM LY294002 (p \ 0.05),
whereas the protective effect of 0.5 mg/ml THSWD
exhibited a decreased trend but without statistical significance in the presence of 20 lM LY294002. ARE decoy
ODNs could inhibit the expression of Nrf2 driving phase II
enzymes. In this study, ARE decoy ODNs significantly
reduced THSWD-mediated protection against OGD-Rep
(p \ 0.001) (Fig. 5b). Although ARE mut ODNs also
slightly reduced THSWD-mediated protection, the extent
of the reduction caused by ARE decoy ODNs was significantly larger than that caused by ARE mut ODNs
(p \ 0.01). Therefore, it is clear that both LY294002 and
ARE decoy ODNs significantly decreased THSWD-mediated protection against OGD-Rep, suggesting that THSWD
ameliorated OGD-Rep-induced injury via PI3K/Akt and
the Nrf2 signaling pathway.

Discussion
Oxidative stress in animal models of ischemic stroke has
been shown to cause neuronal damage via the opening of
potassium channels and altered vascular reactivity, the
breakdown of the blood–brain barrier and focal destructive
lesions [2, 3]. Antioxidant therapy is important for reducing oxidative stress and preventing neuronal death. Thus, it
has gradually become an alternative treatment to neurological damage caused by ischemic stroke. The transcription factor Nrf2, which regulates a battery of phase II
enzymes, is known as the major mechanism of cellular
defense against oxidative stress [4]. A previous study
demonstrated that prophylactic treatment with tertbutylhydroquinone, a well-characterized Nrf2 inducer, significantly improved behavioral and histological outcome.
Importantly, this beneficial effect could last up to 1 month
after reperfusion [8]. Thus, pharmacological intervention
activating Nrf2 signaling may be a promising approach for
limiting oxidative stress after ischemic stroke.
Herbal medicines used in traditional Chinese medicine
(TCM) and other folk medicines are found to be rich in
antioxidant agents [23]. Our previous study also demonstrated that senkyunolide-H, -I [20] and Z-ligustilide [7], a
group of phthalides isolated from TCM, exhibited antioxidative effect via activation of the Nrf2-HO-1 signaling
pathway. Recently, a microarray study in MCF-7 cells
discovered that Nrf2-mediated antioxidant and cytoprotective genes were most significantly affected by SWD, an

83

old formula mainly used for improving female health [14].
In this study, we focused on a Chinese herbal medicine
formula THSWD, which is derived from SWD, to explore
its effect on activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway and
its potential role in preferably applicable disease-ischemic
stroke. We first found that THSWD significantly protected
against rat brain damage by transient MCAO in terms of
infarct volume and neurological function. These results are
largely in accordance with a previous study by Wu et al.
[13]. However, we also found that the efficacy of high-dose
THSWD (1.5 g/kg/day) is lower than that of middle dose
(1.0 g/kg/day), which exhibited an inverted U-shaped
dose-response curve. Neurohormesis, referring to hormesis in neurons, defines a class of useful stressors that could
significantly enhance the neuronal resistance to more
severe or even lethal stress [24]. Various phytochemicals
are well-known to activate several transcription factors
including Nrf2 to modulate cellular adaptive stress
responses to various stimuli [24, 25]. Typical hormetic
effect is characterized by an inverted U-shaped biphasic
dose-response curve [26]. Our previous study demonstrated that Z-ligustilide activated Nrf2-mediated neurohormesis against OGD-Rep-induced injury [7]. In this
study, THSWD also exhibited a similar dose-response
curve in the protection of I/R-induced injury. It is possible
that THSWD also has a neurohormetic effect, which could
enhance the rat’s resistance to I/R-induced neuronal damage. We then further determined the expression of HO-1, a
key endogenous antioxidant enzyme regulated by Nrf2, in
rats after I/R. The results from both Western blotting and
immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that HO-1
maintained a low level in the sham group, whereas an
increase was detected after MCAO insult in the vehicle
group, indicating HO-1 as an adaptive stress response may
quickly increase to enhance the rat’s resistance to I/Rinduced oxidative stress. Importantly, THSWD significantly induced HO-1 expression in the I/R rat, which may
further enhance the cellular resistance to oxidative stress.
The biphasic- inducing trend to HO-1 shown by the three
doses of THSWD is in accordance with their effects on
infarct volume and neurological function, which further
supports the fact that the neurohormetic effect may be
underlying its neuroprotection against I/R-induced injury.
We further characterized the effect of THSWD in cultured
PC12 cells. THSWD induced the expression of HO-1
protein in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.
Further Western blotting and immunocytochemical staining demonstrated that THSWD promoted the nuclear
translocation of Nrf2. These results further demonstrated
that THSWD could activate the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
It is reported that translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus
can be triggered by phosphorylation on serine 40. Nrf2
phosphorylation may be regulated through several signal

transduction pathways, such as PI3K/Akt [27]. In our
study, we found that phosphorylation of Akt was significantly influenced by THSWD. Inhibition of PI3K activity
by specific inhibitor, LY294002, attenuated THSWDinduced accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus. These results
indicate that PI3K may be involved in the Nrf2 signaling
pathway activated by THSWD.
The Nrf2 signaling pathway was previously demonstrated to enhance cellular resistance to I/R-induced oxidative stress via mediating downstream antioxidant
proteins [7, 8]. To further directly determine the role of the
Nrf2 signaling pathway in THSWD-mediated neuroprotection, we performed experiments in an in vitro OGD-Rep
model. The results showed that inhibition of PI3K activity
by LY294002 significantly attenuated the protective effect
of THSWD. It is possible that inhibition of PI3K activity
resulted in the inactivation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway.
Moreover, the PI3K/Akt pathway is also a key survivalpromoting signaling pathway [28, 29]. Therefore, it may
also activate survival promoting signals and inhibit OGDRep-induced cell death via activation of Akt kinase in
parallel. Meanwhile, we pre-treated PC12 cells with ARE
decoy ODNs to directly examine the role of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in the protective effect of THSWD against
OGD-Rep-induced injury. After inhibition of Nrf2-driven
proteins with the decoy ONDs, the protective effect of
THSWD was significantly reduced. The mut ODNs also
slightly reduced the effect of THSWD. It may be due to the
cytotoxicity caused by transfection reagent. However, the
significant difference between the reducing potency of
decoy ONDs and mut ODNs could still reflect the role of
the Nrf2 signaling pathway activated by THSWD. These
results demonstrated that PI3K/Akt and Nrf2 signaling
pathway-regulated antioxidant and cytoprotective proteins
may play a critical role in this protective process of
THSWD against OGD-Rep-induced injury.

Conclusion
The present study examined the potential effect of THSWD
on the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway and also the
role of this cytoprotective pathway in THSWD-mediated
protection against I/R-induced injury. We found that
THSWD protected brain injury by transient MCAO in rats.
Additionally, the key endogenous antioxidant enzyme, HO1, was significantly further induced by THSWD in this
in vivo model. In cultured PC12 cells, we further characterized THSWD-mediated PI3K/Akt and the Nrf2 signaling
pathway. Finally, we verified that the protective action of
THSWD against the injury induced by OGD-Rep may
probably be mediated, at least in part, by PI3K/Akt and the
Nrf2 sigaling pathway. These results provide a better
