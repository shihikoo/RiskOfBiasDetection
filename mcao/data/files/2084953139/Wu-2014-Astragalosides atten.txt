Abstract. Astragalosides (ASTs) have been traditionally used
in the treatment of various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate
the neuroprotective effects of AST on learning and memory
following focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in a rat model.
A Morris water maze was used to measure the effect of AST
on learning and memory impairments. A histological examination and Hoechst 33258 staining was used to observe the
neuronal changes and apoptosis in the hippocampus. The
activity of phospho-extracellular signal‑regulated kinases
(p‑ERK), p‑c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p‑Akt was
measured by western blotting. The data revealed that AST
improved the rats learning and memory abilities, attenuated
neuronal cells apoptosis, increased the expression of p‑ERK
and p‑Akt, and decreased the expression of p‑JNK. These
findings indicated that AST has protective effects that may be
correlated with the inhibition of neuronal cell apoptosis and
the regulation of p‑ERK, p‑Akt and p‑JNK expression.
Introduction
Ischemic brain injury is a common cause of permanent
disability and is associated with dementia and cognitive
decline in the elderly (1). Certain surgical procedures that
involve the reduction or interruption of the blood supply to
the brain and events such as strokes, are often accompanied
by memory loss that persists for several months during
recovery. These changes are believed to be associated with
focal cerebral ischemia. The middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO) that was originally developed in rats

is considered to be a reliable and reproducible model. The
model induces deficits in cognitive function in the rats, which
appear to remain fairly stable (2,3).
Neurotrophic factors are known to be critical in neurite
outgrowth and cell survival. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and
brain-derived neutrophic factor (BDNF) may bind to acceptors, stimulate the downstream signaling pathways and protect
rat hippocampal neurons against ischemic cell damage (4).
Mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members,
including extracellular signal‑regulated kinases (ERK)1/2,
p38 MAPK and c‑Jun N‑terminal kinase (JNK), respond to
various extracellular stimuli, thereby transmitting extracellular signals into the nucleus. The JNK signaling pathway is
a potential cascade mediating neuronal apoptosis triggered by
focal ischemia (5). While, the MEK/ERK pathway is important in cell growth and differentiation following ischemia,
activation of the Akt kinase pathway by growth factors also
has neuroprotective effects (6).
Astragalus is a traditional Chinese medicine, also known
as legumes Mongolia astragalus or the dried root of Astragalus
membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. Astragalosides (ASTs) are the
main component of Astragalus and function as antioxidants,
in immune regulation and to promote intelligence. ASTs
have been commonly used in the prevention and treatment of
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, aging, immune
function disorders and other diseases. Our previous studies
revealed that ASTs have protective effects against ischemic
damage (7,8) and improve behavioral disorders, including
problems with spatial learning and memory in AD rats (9);
therefore, we hypothesize that AST may improve the learning
and memory abilities of rats following ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. On the basis of the association between
cognitive decline and AST, the current study was performed to
observe whether AST regulates the behavioral disorder in rats
following ischemia, and its possible mechanism.

were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa
Cruz, CA, USA).
Animals. Sprague‑Dawley rats (weight, 250‑325 g) were
supplied by The Experimental Animal Center of Anhui
Medical University (Hefei, China). Animals were housed
four per cage, allowed access to water and food ad libitum
and maintained in a constant temperature of 22±2˚C, with a
humidity of 50±10% under a 12 h light/dark cycle. Animal
treatment and maintenance was conducted in accordance with
the guidelines for the humane treatment of animals set by the
association of Laboratory Animal Sciences and The Center for
Laboratory Animal Sciences at Anhui Medical University.
Rat I/R model and treatment. The MCAO surgery was conducted
according to previously described methods (10). The rats
were anesthetized by 10% chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, intraperitonealy) and placed in dorsal recumbency. A longitudinal
incision of 1.5 cm in length was made in the midline of the
ventral cervical skin. The right common carotid artery, internal
carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) were
exposed and carefully isolated. A nylon monofilament (40 mm
in length and 0.24 mm in diameter), its tip rounded by
flame‑heating, was inserted from the lumen of the ECA to that
of the right ICA to occlude the origin of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA). The right MCA was occluded for 120 min,
following which, the cerebral blood flow was restored by
withdrawal of the nylon thread.
As a means of assessing the adequacy of the occlusion, a
neurological score was assigned to each animal 5 min prior
to removing the occlusion and at 22 h after reperfusion: 0, no
deficit; 1, forelimb weakness; 2, circling to the affected side,
3, partial paralysis on the affected side; and 4, no spontaneous
motor activity. Following 120 min of occlusion, all the animals
were randomly assigned according to the neurological function deficit score (11) to one of the following groups: I/R,
AST (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) or Gin (40 mg/kg). The rats were
administered treatment by gavage at 0, 8 and 24 h reperfusion, then once a day for 7 days. Sham‑control animals were
prepared in the same way, with the exception of the insertion
of a nylon surgical thread into the right ICA. The animal body
temperature was maintained at 37±1˚C during and following
the surgery. The animals were sacrificed by decapitation
following a Morris water maze (MWM) test at reperfusion
day 7, and the brain was used for immunohistochemistry.
Another batch of rats was randomly divided into the
following five groups: Sham, I/R, Gin (40 mg/kg) and
AST (40 and 80 mg/kg). These rats were administrated
treatment by gavage once a day for 7 days. After the last
intragastric administration, the rats were underwent MCAO
for 120 min, then the thread was withdrawn and the blood flow
for was restored for 22 h, before the rats were sacrificed. A
neurological score was assigned to each animal 5 min prior to
removing the occlusion and at 22 h post‑reperfusion. At 22 h
after reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed and the brains were
dissected, frozen in powdered dry ice and stored at ‑80˚C until
further use for western‑blotting.
MWM test. An MWM was used to test spatial learning and
memory, and was performed on days 4, 5, 6 and 7 post‑ischemia.

The maze consisted of a black circular pool 2.14 m in diameter
and 80 cm in height, filled with water at 21‑22˚C to a height
of 50 cm. A black circular platform that was 9 cm in diameter
was placed 2.0 cm below the water line in the center of one
quadrant and remained in the same position. Several, constant,
large visual cues surrounded the tank at a height of 120‑150 cm
to facilitate orientation. The rat was placed in the water facing
the wall at one of four random start locations (north, south,
east and west, locating at equal distances from each other on
the pool rim). Each rat was allowed to locate the submerged
platform within 90 sec and rest on it for 20 sec. If the rat failed
to locate the hidden platform within 90 sec, it was placed on it
for 20 sec. The procedure was repeated for all the four starting
locations. The latency to reach the platform and the swimming
speed were recorded, each representing the average of four
trials. The escape latency, i.e. the time to reach the platform,
and the length of the path the animal swam to find the platform
were used to assess the acquisition of the water‑maze task. The
shorter the latency to locate the platform, the better the rats
memory for its location was considered to be.
Histological examination. For the histological examination,
the rats were perfused transcardially with normal saline,
followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains
were removed and stored in the same paraformaldehyde solution. Serial paraffin sections were cut coronally on a Leica
microtome (Mannheim, Germany). The sections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined under a
light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Hoeschst 33258 staining. For nuclear staining, the paraffin
sections were deparaffinized with xylene (Beyotime,
Shanghai, China) twice for 15  min at 37˚C, washed with
phosphate‑buffered saline (PBS), mounted onto slides using
antifade mounting medium (Beyotime,) and then examined by
fluorescence microscopy (Olympus). Morphologically, cells
undergoing apoptosis should appear smaller than normal, with
chromatin that appears condensed and deeply stained. Cellular
fragmentation into apoptotic bodies also occurs.
Western blotting. The rats were sacrificed by decapitation at
a specified time under anesthesia. The infarcted brains were
separated, frozen quickly in liquid nitrogen and stored at ‑80˚C.
The tissues were homogenized in ice‑cold homogenization
buffer (HB; Beyotime). Following the protein concentration
measurement using the Lowry method, with bovine serum
used as a standard, each sample was diluted to equal protein
concentrations with HB. Next, 4X sodium dodecyl sulfate‑polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‑PAGE) sample buffer
was added into the sample, which was then boiled in a 100˚C
waterbath for 10 min. Protein (50 µg) was loaded onto each
lane, separated by 15% SDS‑PAGE and transferred onto a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was
blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h and then probed with
p‑ERK1/2 (1:1,000; 9101; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) or
ERK1/2 (1:1,000; 9102; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA) at
4˚C overnight. The detection was performed using horseradish
peroxidase‑conjugated goat anti‑rabbit IgG and developed
using 0.05% 3,3'‑diaminobenzidine in PBS containing 0.01%
H2O2. The bands on the membrane were scanned and analyzed

Results
Effects of AST on learning and memory impairment in I/R
rats. To measure the correlation between the brain I/R injury
and cognitive deficits and the protective effects of AST in
rats, learning and memory was assessed by the MWM test.
At each day of observation of the MWM test, the ischemic
rats spent more time locating the submerged platform
when compared with the sham rats. At days 4, 5 and 6, the
AST (20 mg/kg)‑treated ischemic rats showed a trend towards
locating the platform in a shorter time relative to the ischemic
group. The AST (40 mg/kg)‑treated group exhibited a short-

ened latency at day 6, while AST (80 mg/kg) also had the same
effect at days 5 and 6. At the last testing day (day 7), AST (20,
40, 80 mg/kg) markedly shortened the time it took to locate
the hidden platform compared with the ischemic rats (P<0.05
or P<0.01) (Table I).
The length of the path the rats swam to locate the
platform was also recorded to assess the acquisition of
the water‑maze task. Compared with the sham group, the
I/R group rats swam a longer distance to locate the platform (P<0.01). AST (40 mg/kg) shortened the distance at
day 6, and AST (40 mg/kg) had the same action at days 5 and
6. On the last testing day, AST (20, 40, 80 mg/kg) markedly
shortened the distance swam when compared with the I/R
group (P<0.01) (Table II).
Effect of AST on neuronal degenerative changes and apoptosis
in the hippocampus of I/R rats. To investigate the correlation
between memory impairment and neuronal degeneration and
apoptosis, the neuropathology and levels of apoptosis were
measured (Fig. 1). The model group demonstrated neuron
degeneration in the hippocampus (CA1), whereas no evident
neuronal abnormalities were present in the control group. The

neuronal cell bodies became small and deeply stained with
dye. AST may improve the pathomorphological changes of
the hippocampal neurons and reduce the neuronal chromatin,
which is condensed.
Hippocampal neuronal apoptosis was explored further
by staining with Hoechst 33258, which binds to chromatin
and allows fluorescent visualization of normal and condensed

chromatin. Morphologically, the cells undergoing apoptosis
became small and deeply stained and cellular fragmentation into apoptotic bodies occured (Fig. 2A). Compared
with the control group, the percentage of condensed cells
in the hippocampus increased in the MCAO rats, whereas
AST significantly decreased the percentage in the hippocampus (CA1) (Fig. 2B).

Effect of AST on the neurological function evaluation of
MCAO rats. A neurological deficit score may indicate the
neurological function impairment of rats following ischemia
reperfusion injury. AST (40, 80 mg/kg) significantly reduced
the neurological deficit score when compared with the I/R
group, indicating that pretreatment with AST may improve the
neurological disorder induced by cerebral I/R (Table III).
Effects of AST on the activity of p‑ERK, p‑JNK and p‑Akt in
the brains of I/R rats. To further analyze the cell signaling
pathways responsible for the AST neuroprotective effects,
western blotting was performed with tissue samples obtained
from the brain tissue of the ischemic rats. As shown in Fig. 3,
the bands for p‑ERK, p‑JNK and p‑Akt were observed in each
group. The level of p‑ERK, p‑JNK and p‑Akt was quantified
by densitometry. There was increased phosphorylation of ERK
and Akt, and decreased phosphorylation of JNK in the I/R
group; pretreatment with AST (40 or 80 mg/kg) may activate
ERK and Akt phosphorylation while depressing JNK phosphorylation further.
Discussion
The development of mazes to investigate spatial learning and
memory has provided a method to determine the protective
effects of drugs on the behavioral consequences and the neurological damage to the hippocampus and other areas involved
in the neurotoxic effects of ischemia (12). The deficits on the
learning and memory of rats following I/R injury was therefore measured by MWM in the present study. MCAO induced
a failure in the spatial memory function of the rats when they
were tested on days 4 to 7 following the surgery. This result
demonstrated that AST shortened the latency and distance
of swimming compared with the I/R group, which indicated
that AST was able to diminish the abnormal behavioral
performance following I/R. Gin is extracted from the leaves of
Ginkgo biloba and is a famous Chinese traditional medicine
used for treating cerebrovascular diseases and Alzheimer's
disease, therefore it was selected as a positive control. The
data revealed that Gin may shorten the latency and distance of
swimming, similar to the effects of AST.

The I/R injury induced neuronal apoptosis and learning and
memory impairments, therefore, the protective effects of AST
on neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus were investigated
further. Apoptosis is a subtype of cell death that is involved
in diverse physiological and pathological processes (13). In
the present study, a histological examination revealed that the
neuronal cell bodies became short and deeply stained with dye
following I/R injury, and nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258
displayed nuclear condensation and fragmentation in the cells
undergoing apoptosis. AST may ameliorate these pathological

1324

changes and inhibit the apoptosis in the hippocampus in
MCAO rats. This may be the protective mechanism of AST
on I/R injury.
Our previous data demonstrated that AST may increase
the expression of NGF and BDNF and the mRNA expression
of TrkA and TrkB, while decreasing the p75 NTR mRNA
level (7,8). Therefore we hypothesize that AST may produce
a marked effect through growth factors and downstream
signaling pathways. The ERK, JNK and Akt signaling pathways may regulate neuronal survival and apoptosis following
ischemia, but the majority of studies agree that the levels
of p‑ERK, p‑JNK and p‑Akt decrease after 24 h or more
following ischemia (14,15), therefore the level of p‑ERK,
p‑JNK and p‑Akt was detected 22 h after reperfusion in the
present study. The p‑ERK levels were enhanced following use
of a variety of protective agents, such as BDNF and erythropoietin (16‑18). The phosphorylation of ERK is an essential
component in inducing neuroprotection. The serine/threonine
kinase, Akt, also known as protein kinase B, enhances survival
with cerebral ischemia through a PI3‑kinase‑dependent
signaling pathway. PI3K/Akt signaling is also important in
neurogenesis. In addition, Akt is a critical mediator of cellular
responses to growth factors, whereas JNK may be a key mediator for the transmission of apoptotic signals to mitochondrial
apoptosis‑related proteins (19,20). The JNK signaling pathway
has been demonstrated to be activated following focal cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, ischemia‑induced JNK activity
may promote neuronal apoptosis (21). In the present study,
the changes in ERK, JNK and Akt phosphorylation were
measured in the rats treated with AST, and the results revealed
that AST was able to increase ERK and Akt phosphorylation
and decrease the expression of p‑JNK following I/R.
In conclusion, the present study indicated that AST may
attenuate learning and memory impairments in rats following
ischemia‑reperfusion, and that this may be associated with the
regulation of ERK, JNK and Akt phosphorylation and their
expression levels.
