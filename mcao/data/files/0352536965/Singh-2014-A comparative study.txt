A comparative study of neuroprotective effect of single
and combined blockade of AT1 receptor and PARP-1
in focal cerebral ischaemia in rat
Neetu Singh, Gaurav Sharma, Nilendra Singh, and Kashif Hanif
Background Cerebral ischaemia results in enhanced expression of type 1 angiotensin receptor and oxidative stress.
Free radicals due to oxidative stress lead to excessive
DNA damage causing overactivation of poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase-1 resulting in neuronal death. Activation of
both type 1 angiotensin receptors and poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase-1 following cerebral ischaemia takes place
simultaneously, but until now, no study has explored the
effect of combined blockade of both angiotensin type 1
angiotensin receptor and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 in
cerebral ischaemia.
Aim Our purpose was to compare the effect of single and
combined treatment with angiotensin type 1 angiotensin
receptor blocker, candesartan, and the poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase-1 inhibitor, 1, 5 isoquinolinediol, on brain
damage and oxidative stress in transient focal cerebral
ischaemia in rats.
Method Transient focal cerebral ischaemia was induced in
Sprague-Dawley rats by an intraluminal technique for
two-hours following 48 h of reperfusion. Candesartan
(0·05 mg/kg) was administered just after initiation of
ischaemia followed by a repeat administration at 24 h while
1, 5 isoquinolinediol (0·1 mg/kg) was given one-hour after
of ischaemia. After 24 h of reperfusion, neurological deficit
was evaluated in the different treatment groups. After
48 h of reperfusion, the rats were sacrificed and the brain
was isolated. Ischaemic brain damage by 2,3,5 triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride staining, oxidative stress markers,
and levels of reactive oxygen species were determined biochemically.
Result Single treatment with candesartan and 1, 5 isoquinolinediol significantly reduced neurological deficit, infarct,

and oedema volume as compared to ischaemic control and
different vehicle groups for each of the drugs. However,
treatment with candesartan + 1, 5 isoquinolinediol offered
greater reduction in neurological deficit, cerebral infarct
volume, and oedema as compared to single-drug treatments.
Furthermore, treatment with candesartan + 1, 5 isoquinolinediol significantly decreased oxidative stress as compared
to single treatments with each drug.
Conclusion The study suggests that blockade of either type
1 angiotensin receptor or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
alone provides neuroprotection, but the better result was
achieved when both type 1 angiotensin receptor and poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 were blocked together by the
combined use of their pharmacological inhibitor in transient
cerebral ischaemia in rat.

Introduction
Cerebral ischaemia or stroke is a major health crisis throughout the world (1). The only drug therapy available for stroke is
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, with a narrow
therapeutic window and haemorrhagic complications. Among
various reasons, a major cause for the failure of anti-stroke
molecules/drugs in clinical trials is the use of a single-drug
intervention for cerebral ischaemia, despite the complex and
multifactorial nature of stroke (2).
Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main effector peptide of the
renin angiotensin system regulating vascular tone, sympathetic
transmission, and body fluid volume. A number of studies
showed the involvement of Ang II in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischaemia through stimulation of its receptors, the type 1
angiotensin (AT1) receptor (3,4). Ang II, acting via the AT1
receptor, contributes to ischaemic brain damage by reduction
of cerebral blood flow, induction of inflammation, production
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with consecutive cell destruction, or promotion of apoptosis and necrosis (5–7). Previous
studies showed that chronic pretreatment with an AT1 receptor
antagonist significantly improved neurological outcome and
reduced the infarct size after transient focal cerebral ischaemia
in normotensive rats (8–10). Furthermore, blockade of AT1
receptors in the acute phase of experimental ischaemic stroke
has also been shown to be beneficial (11,12).

Ischaemic stroke triggers excessive generation of ROS
causing cell membrane destruction by inducing lipid peroxidation and single- and/or double-strand breaks in DNA
(13,14). The DNA strand breaks lead to the activation of the
DNA repair enzyme, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1). Massive DNA damage mediated by cerebral ischaemia/
reperfusion (I/R) injury resulted in excessive PARP-1
activation, leading to cell death (15–17). There are numerous
pathways by which PARP-1 is involved in cell damage, viz.
translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and
up-regulation of numerous pro-inflammatory genes which
lead to necrosis (18,19). The PARP-1 inhibitor,
3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), was found to be effective in
reducing neuronal death in cortical cultures and infarct size
following cerebral ischaemia in rats and gerbils (20,21). The
neuroprotective potential of PARP-1 inhibitors such as nicotinamide, 4-amino-1, 8-napthalimide, and 1, 5 isoquinolinediol (ISO) has also been demonstrated in cerebral I/R
injury (22–24).

Aims
Therefore, the earlier discussion guides us to the conclusion
that simultaneous activation of both AT1 receptor and
PARP-1 takes place in cerebral I/R injury and individual
blockade of AT1 receptor and PARP-1 offers neuroprotection.
However, it is not known whether the combined blockade of
these two will modulate neuronal damage or not. Therefore,
the present study will be looking at whether the combined
blockade of AT1 receptor and PARP-1 is beneficial and
compare it with the single treatment of each drug in cerebral
ischaemia.

with thermostatically controlled temperature to maintain at
37 ⫾ 0·5°C during the surgery. Focal cerebral ischaemia was
induced in the male SD rats by the middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo) using a modification of the intraluminal
technique (25,26). Briefly, the left common carotid artery was
exposed through the midline incision in the neck region and
was traced anteriorly to reveal the external carotid artery
(ECA) and internal carotid artery (ICA). A 4·5 cm long 3-0
nylon suture (Ethicon, Johnsons & Johnsons Ltd, Mumbai)
with rounded tip was introduced into the ICA through a small
nick in the ECA and gently advanced about two-centimetres
from the ICA origin until the resistance was felt, which
blocked the origin of MCA. The suture was retracted after
two-hours to allow reperfusion. In sham-operated rats, a
similar surgical procedure was performed except for the insertion of suture. The experimental animals were allowed to
recover from anaesthesia and then transferred into an animal
house, with temperature maintained at 37 ⫾ 0·5°C, and were
allowed food and water ad libitum.

Drug administration
Candesartan (0·05 mg/kg) was dissolved in a vehicle solution
(1 mg in 950 ml of phosphate buffered saline and 50 ml 1 M
Na2CO3) (27). Candesartan or vehicle was administered intraperitonially just after occlusion with a repeat administration
after 24 h (28) in different groups of rats. ISO (0·1 mg/kg) was
dissolved in its vehicle 1% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (24).
ISO or its vehicle was administered one-hour after MCAo in
different groups of rats (Fig. 1, Table 1).

Neurobehavioral assessment
The assessment of neurological deficit was performed by a
blind observer on a 10-point scale after 24 h of reperfusion in
the all groups of rats (25,26). The neurological deficit was
scored as follows:
• flexion (failure to fully extend left forepaw) = 1
• circling (movement in circles in a clockwise, contralateral
direction) = 2
• hemiparesis (failure to scale a vertical grid due to loss of
grip) = 3
• non-spontaneity (no spontaneous movement observed)
=4
The neurobehavioral scores obtained after testing on each
scale were averaged to denote the degree of neurological
deficit. Animals were sacrificed after 48 h of reperfusion for
biochemical and histological studies.

Assessment of infarct volume
The brains were rapidly dissected out after 48 h of reperfusion
and sectioned coronally at two-millimetre intervals from the
rostrum to caudal end. All slices were incubated for 20 min in
a 1% solution of 2,3,5 triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) at
37°C. The sections were scanned and analyzed by a blind
observer using computerized image analysis system (Biovis
Image Plus, Alpha Innotech, CA, USA) to map out the cerebral
infarct in the affected brain tissue (25,26). The infarct area of
all brain sections of each rat of a particular group were analyzed and multiplied by section thickness to obtain the infarct
volume. The software makes a correction for oedema in the
swollen ischaemic hemisphere before calculating the infarct
area as percentage of total brain volume in the slices. The
oedema was quantified as the difference in area between the
contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres.

isolate brain. The ipsilateral parietal cortex and striatum were
immediately dissected out and homogenized in five volumes
of 0·1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7·0. The tissue homogenate was
spun at 1500 g for 15 min at 4°C and supernatant was used
to estimate GSH and MDA levels in the affected brain nuclei.
The total protein concentration of tissue homogenate was
determined by Lowry method (29).

GSH estimation
Sulphosalicylic acid (5% w/v) was added in the brain homogenate to protect the tissue GSH content. The brain homogenate in a volume of 500 ml was added with two-millilitre
phosphate buffer (0·1 M, pH 7·0) and 20 ml 5,5’- dithio-bis
(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (1·98 mg/ml). The final reaction volume of three-millilitres was made with triple distilled
water. The reaction mixture was then vortexed and incubated
at 37°C for 15 min. The intensity of yellow colour developed
was read at 412 nm in a spectrophotometer (30). GSH levels in
the brain were determined by using a standard plot of reduced
GSH and value expressed as mmol/mg protein. Level of GSH
was also estimated in plasma as described previously (26).

MDA estimation
The brain supernatant (500 ml), 30% trichloroacetic acid
(300 ml), 5 M HCl (150 ml), and 2% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid
(TBA) in 0·5 M NaOH (300 ml) were thoroughly mixed up.
After each addition, the total volume was made three-millilitres
with distilled water. The earlier mixture was heated in a water
bath at 80°C for 20 min and centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min.
The resultant pink chromogen formed was measured at
532 nm in a spectrophotometer (25). MDA concentration in
the brain was determined using standard curve and values
expressed as nmol/mg tissue protein in homogenate. Level of
MDA was also estimated in serum as described previously (26).

Biochemical studies
The markers of oxidative stress, malondialdehyde (MDA),
glutathione (GSH), and nitrite were estimated biochemically
in the affected brain loci by a blind observer. After 48 h of
reperfusion, anesthetized rats were transcardially perfused to

in terms of infarct volume (Fig. 3a). In comparison to
ischaemic control (99·81 ⫾ 8·33 mm3), infarct volume was
significantly reduced in candesartan (72·98 ⫾ 3·40 mm3,
P < 0·01) and ISO (37·70 ⫾ 5·83 mm3 P < 0·001) treatment
groups. Combined treatment with candesartan + ISO
(18·27 ⫾ 3·08 mm3, P < 0·001 vs. candesartan and P < 0·01 vs.
ISO) was more effective in reducing infarct volume than single
treatment groups (Fig. 3b). Single treatment with candesartan
and ISO was significantly effective as compared to ischaemic
control and vehicle control rats in reducing oedema volume
as well. On the other hand, the combined treatment with
candesartan + ISO also reduced significantly the brain
oedema (12·16 ⫾ 1·5, P < 0·001 vs. candesartan and P < 0·01
vs. ISO) than single treatment with each drug (Fig. 3c).

Effect of candesartan, ISO, and their combined
treatment on GSH level
A significant decrease (P < 0·001) in GSH level was observed
in both ipsilateral cortex (c) and striatum (s) of ischaemic
control and vehicle control groups as compared to sham.
In comparison to ischaemic control (0·16 ⫾ 0·01,
0·14 ⫾ 0·01 mmol/mg of protein), level of GSH significantly
increased in both regions of ischaemic brain in candesartan
(0·21 ⫾ 0·01(c), 0·19 ⫾ 0·01(s) mmol/mg of protein, P < 0·05)
and ISO (0·23 ⫾ 0·01(c), 0·22 ⫾ 0·01(s) mmol/mg of protein,

vs. candesartan and P < 0·01 vs. ISO) increase in GSH level
as compared to single treatment with either drug (Fig. 4a).
There was also a significant increase in blood GSH level in
combined treatment as compared to single treatment of either
drug (data not shown).

There was a significant (P < 0·001) increase in MDA levels in
both brain regions of ischaemic control and vehicle control
as compared to sham. In comparison to ischaemic control
(10·74 ⫾ 0·32(c), 12·54 ⫾ 0·33(s) nmol/mg of protein), MDA
level was significantly reduced in candesartan (8·61 ⫾ 1·1(c),

(7·1 ⫾ 0·50(c), 7·5 ⫾ 0·85(s) nmol/mg of protein, P < 0·01)
groups. Treatment with candesartan + ISO effectively reduced
lipid peroxidation (3·82 ⫾ 0·31(c), 4·12 ⫾ 0·49(s) nmol/mg of
protein, P < 0·001 vs. candesartan, P < 0·01 vs. ISO) as compared to single treatment with either drug (Fig. 4b). There was
also a significant decrease in blood MDA level in combined
treatment as compared to single treatment with either drug
(data not shown).

Effect of candesartan, ISO, and their combined
treatment on nitrite level
In comparison to ischaemic control (7 ⫾ 0·79(c), 8·25 ⫾
0·47(s) pmol/mg of protein), the nitrite level was significantly
decreased in the ISO (4·12 ⫾ 0·32(c), 5·87 ⫾ 0·37(s) pmol/mg
of protein, P < 0·01) treated groups. The combined treatment
with candesartan + ISO more significantly reduced nitrite
levels (2 ⫾ 0·30(c), 3·5 ⫾ 0·35(s) pmol/mg of protein, P <
0·001 vs. candesartan, P < 0·01 vs. ISO) in both regions of
ischaemic rat brain as compared to single treatment with
either drug (Fig. 4c).

Effect of candesartan, ISO, and their combined
treatment on ROS
The production of ROS was measured relative to sham. There
was a significant increase in ROS level in ischaemic control
and vehicle control groups (P < 0·001) as compared to sham.
In comparison to ischaemic control, treatment with candesartan (P < 0·05) and ISO (P < 0·01) decreased ROS production significantly in both brain regions, while combined
treatment with candesartan + ISO reduced amount of ROS
(P < 0·01 vs. candesartan and P < 0·05 vs. ISO) more significantly as compared to single treatment with candesartan or
ISO (Fig. 5).

Discussion
The pathology of cerebral stroke is complex and multifactorial; hence, a combinational drug therapy was always advocated for stroke by the Stroke Therapy Academic Industrial
Round Table body (33). Therefore, the present work was
designed to compare the combined effect of pharmacological
blockade of AT1 receptor and PARP-1 with individual blockade of each in transient cerebral ischaemia in rats. The combined blockade of AT1 receptor and PARP-1 reduced the brain

infarct size, oedema volume, and improved the neurological
deficit significantly as compared to the single treatments with
either drug. The combined treatment also significantly
reduced the oxidative stress markers and ROS as compared to
single treatments after I/R injury.
In the present study, candesartan treatment produced
significant neuroprotection by decreasing infarct volume,
oedema, and improving neurological deficit in cerebral
ischaemia. These results are supported by previous studies in
which AT1 receptor blockers reduced brain damage in the
experimental cerebral ischaemia (34–36). There is enhanced
expression of angiotensin AT1 receptors just after occlusion
(9) and between 24 and 48 h after occlusion in the ipsilateral
middle cerebral artery (7) in cerebral ischaemia. This may
become detrimental as AT1 receptor is involved in vasoconstriction resulting in decreased perfusion in the ischaemic
hemisphere. This is the reason behind the treatment schedule
of candesartan followed in the present study. The AT1 receptor antagonist, candesartan, was also able to cross the blood–
brain barrier and offered a significant protection in various
neurological diseases such as neuroinflammation, dementia,
and cerebral ischaemia (35,37,38). The dose chosen in the
study did not reduce the blood pressure (28) as reports suggested that AT1 receptor blockade offered beneficial effect
only when extensive blood pressure reduction is avoided in

cerebral ischaemia (38,39). This suggests that the neuroprotective effect of AT1 receptor blockade is independent of
its antihypertensive action. Furthermore, Stenman et al. (28)
observed no significant effect of treatment with candesartan
at the dose of 0·05 mg/kg on infarct size, but we found a
significant reduction in infarct size with the same dose. This
may be due to the difference in rat strain as we used SD rats,
whereas Wistar rats were used by Stenman et al. for MCAo
model.
In the present study, single treatment with AT1 receptor
blocker reduced the levels of lipid peroxidation and ROS,
and increased level of GSH significantly. Following cerebral
ischaemia, superoxide radicals are formed by NADPH
oxidase or xanthine oxidase leading to oxidative stress (2,40).
Ang II is one of the most important oxidative stress inducers
via ROS generation by NADPH oxidase (41). A number of
studies have shown that inhibition of AT1 receptors reduced
the production of superoxide and inflammation which
reduced oxidative stress in the ischaemic brain (42–44).
Other studies also suggested that blockade of AT1 receptor
offered protection in cerebral stroke via decreased expression
of c-Fos, c-Jun, matrix metalloproteinases, inducible nitric
oxide synthase which are involved in neuronal apoptosis
or formation of oedema or reduction in blood flow
(11,12,34).

In our study, treatment with a dose of 0·1 mg/kg of ISO,
PARP-1 inhibitor, offered a significant reduction in infarct, in
oedema volume, and in neurological deficit as reported
by other studies also (24). Studies by immunohistochemistry
and immunofluorescence demonstrated that activation of
PARP-1 occurred after one-hour ischaemic insult and persists
up to two-hours along with excessive DNA damage (15,45),
while other studies suggested that PARP-1 activity peaked at the
first 30 min of ischaemic insult in I/R injury (46). It is for this
reason that we chose to administer the PARP-1 inhibitor after
one-hour of occlusion in the current study.
According to various reports, the generation of superoxide
and peroxynitrite leads to DNA damage, and overactivation of
PARP-1 is culminating in cellular dysfunction, apoptosis, and
necrosis following I/R injury (15,17,47,48). In the present
study also, there was a significant rise in the ROS level and
oxidative stress markers which was significantly prevented by

with oxidative stress because activated PARP-1 excessively synthesizes poly (ADP-ribose) polymers (PAR) which may cause
the opening of membrane permeability transition pore
leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress
(49,50). This may decrease the antioxidant such as GSH and
increase lipid peroxidation and nitrite level. The antioxidative
action of PARP-1 inhibition was confirmed by increase in
GSH, decrease in lipid peroxidation and nitrite production
following treatment with ISO. This may be due to less PAR
formation due to PARP-1 inhibition. Neuroprotection due to
inhibition of PARP-1 is evidenced by other studies also.
Kaundal et al. (51) demonstrated activation of PARP-1 in
cerebral ischaemia, and inhibitors of PARP-1 provided neuroprotection by reducing DNA fragmentation and brain inflammation, and preserved the functionality of the blood–brain
barrier with reduced oedema (48,52,53). PARP-1 inhibitors
also offered neuroprotection by down-regulating the proinflammatory genes and apoptosis via inhibiting the
localization of AIF (18,19).
As discussed earlier, cerebral ischaemia increased the
expression of AT1 receptors that leads to oxidative stress and
overactivation of PARP-1 due to excessive DNA damage.
Hence, we were interested to know whether combined inhibition of AT1 receptor and PARP-1 could produce better neuroprotection. Combined treatment with candesartan + ISO
produced +79% decrease in infarct volume higher than the
monotherapy groups. The combined therapy also offered a
more pronounced decrease in ROS level resulting in decreased
level of MDA and nitrite and increase in GSH. The enhanced
neuroprotection, as compared to single treatment, may be due
to the sequential blockade of consecutive steps of the pathological mechanism involving AT1 receptors and PARP-1 in
cerebral I/R injury. This finding is supported by reports
which showed that the combined inhibition of AT1 receptor
with other potential targets such as endothelin receptors
offered more neuroprotection in cerebral ischaemia
(28,54,55). Similarly, combination of PARP inhibitors like
nicotinamide or 3-AB with antioxidant melatonin or z-VADfmk produced enhanced neuroprotection in focal cerebral
ischaemia in rat (20,56).
The use of AT1 receptor antagonists is already prevalent for
hypertension and candesartan proved to be a safe therapy for
stroke treatment in the ACCESS clinical trial (57). PARP-1
inhibitors are also clinically approved for cancer therapy and
showed a significant neuroprotection in experimental cerebral
stroke. Furthermore, it can also be concluded that pathways
mediated by AT1 receptor and PARP-1 get activated simultaneously. This provides a stronger justification for the simultaneous blockade of AT1 receptor and PARP-1 in cerebral
ischaemia by their pharmacological inhibitors. As their inhibitors are already being used clinically, the use of AT1 receptor
antagonist and PARP-1 inhibitor in combination will give a
safer option for multiple drug therapy for the effective
management of stroke.
