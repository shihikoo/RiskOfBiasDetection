Abstract Acute hyperglycemia (HG) exacerbates reperfusion
injury and aggravates tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced hemorrhagic transformation (HT). Previous experimental hyperglycemic stroke studies employed very high blood
glucose levels and exclusively used suture occlusion model
to induce ischemia. Only few studies evaluated HG in embolic
stroke and mostly involving the use of 10-fold higher dose of
tPA than that is used in patients. However, the interaction
between acute HG and low (human) dose tPA in different
experimental models of stroke has never been reported. We
first tested the impact of the severity of acute HG on stroke
outcome. Building upon our findings, we then compared the
impact of mild acute HG on neurovascular injury in rats sub-

jected to suture or thromboembolic occlusion with and without low dose tPA. We assessed cerebral blood flow, neurobehavioral outcomes, infarction, hemorrhage, and edema. tPA
did not change the infarct size in either control or hyperglycemic animals when compared to no tPA groups. HG increased
HT and worsened functional outcomes in both suture and
embolic occlusion models. The combination of HG and tPA
exacerbated the vascular injury and worsened the neurological
deficits more than each individual treatment in both models.
Our findings show that the interaction between HG and even
low dose tPA has detrimental effects on the cerebrovasculature
and functional outcomes independent of the method of
reperfusion.

Introduction
Almost 40 % of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients present
with admission hyperglycemia (HG), an independent predictor of poor outcomes in AIS [1, 2]. Restoration of cerebral
blood flow (CBF) to the ischemic brain is paramount for the
salvation of the ischemic penumbra. However, reperfusion
itself can induce brain injury through increased oxidative
stress and inflammation. Moreover, HG exacerbates the reperfusion injury [3–6]. As recently reviewed, experimental
models using various methods to induce hyperglycemia in
different species recapitulated the clinical findings and
showed that HG increases infarct size, brain swelling, hemorrhagic transformation (HT), blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, and neurological deficits [7–12]. However, most of
these preclinical studies employed very high blood glucose

172

levels and used a mix of diabetes and acute HG models. Given
that patients that have HG with no prior history of diabetes
suffer the least favorable clinical outcomes, in a recent study
we compared the neurovascular injury after ischemic stroke in
acute hyperglycemia and diabetes models. We reported that
even a mild and acute elevation in blood glucose increases
vascular injury and worsens functional outcome [9]. Since
these past studies, including ours, almost exclusively used a
suture occlusion model to induce stroke, which promptly restores CBF to the ischemic area, a direct comparison of the
impact of the method of reperfusion on acute hyperglycemic
stroke injury and outcome remained to be determined.
Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDAapproved therapy for AIS patients. Yet, its use in the clinical
setting is limited due to its narrow therapeutic window and
increased risk of cerebral bleeding, which is more profound
under hyperglycemic conditions [13–15]. In spite of the importance of tPA in the clinical setting, only a handful of studies
involved tPA in experimental hyperglycemic models.
Moreover, due to the differences in human and rodent fibrinolytic system, current embolic stroke models use 10 times greater dose of tPA than that is used in patients [7, 16–20]. Thus, in
this translational study using suture and thromboembolic occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCA), with and without
human dose tPA in the hyperglycemic setting, we tested the
hypothesis that even acute mild HG worsens the neurovascular
injury and stroke outcomes irrespective of the method of reperfusion and that the use of tPA amplifies this injury.

Materials and Methods
Animal Models
The animals were housed at the Georgia Regents University
animal care facility, which is approved by the American
Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.
This study was conducted in accordance with the National
Institute of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals
in research, and all protocols were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.
Study 1 To determine the effect of the severity of hyperglycemia, male Wistar rats (Harlan Laboratories Inc., Indianapolis,
IN) were assigned to three different groups: (1) control/
normoglycemic (NG) (90–120 mg/dl), (2) mild HG (BG
140–200 mg/dl), and (3) severe HG (BG 240–350 mg/dl).
Animals from all groups were subjected to 90 min MCA occlusion (MCAO) by the suture occlusion method and up to
24 h reperfusion. Thirty percent and 60 % glucose solutions
were used to achieve blood glucose levels of 140–200 and
240–350 mg/dl, respectively. Acute HG was achieved by
2 ml intraperitoneal (IP) injection of glucose solution 15 min

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:171–180

before MCAO. A second dose was given just after the stroke
surgery to maintain HG through 90 min of ischemia. Blood
glucose was measured from the tail vein using a glucometer
(Freestyle, Alameda, CA). Plasma osmolality was measured
using advanced micro-osmometer, model 3300 (Advanced
instruments, INC., Norwood, MA).
Study 2 To determine the effect of tPA and method of reperfusion in hyperglycemic stroke, control (NG) or mild HG
(140–200 mg/dl) male Wistar rats were subjected to either
suture or thromboembolic occlusion of the MCA. Animals
were randomized to receive either tPA (Cathflo Activase
(Alteplase), Genentech) or vehicle (water for injection) of
equal volume. tPA (1 mg/kg) was intravenously infused over
20 min through the jugular vein 2 h after induction of ischemia
to rats with either suture or thromboembolic occlusion.
Preparation of Blood Clots
The method of clot preparation is the same as we previously
reported [21, 22] but with minor modifications for rats to further
increase the stability and strength of the freshly prepared blood
clots. Briefly, arterial blood was withdrawn from a donor rat in a
syringe prefilled with human fibrinogen (10 mg/ml). The blood
was immediately pushed into 20 cm polyethylene (PE)-50
tubes. The tubes were kept for 4–6 h at room temperature and
then at 4 °C for 24 h. The PE-50 tubes containing the clots were
cut into 5 cm long pieces and the formed clots were pushed out
into a petri dish containing sterile water for injection and
allowed to wash for 15 min. Blood clots were then transferred
to a petri dish containing PBS and left for up to 6 h for retraction
at room temperature and then washed with PE-10 tubes. A
single piece (3–4 cm long) of clot was withdrawn in a PE-10
catheter and used to induce MCAO.
Stroke Surgery
Focal cerebral ischemia was performed as previously described [23]. Briefly, 90 min MCAO was performed under
2 % isoflurane anesthesia followed by up to 24 h reperfusion.
A midline cervical incision was made to expose the common
carotid artery. The external carotid artery (ECA) was separated, ligated, and cauterized. An arteriotomy was performed on
the ECA stump. A rounded-tip 3-0 monofilament nylon suture
(prepared carefully under microscope with high magnification
power to ensure uniformity) was inserted into the ECA stump
and advanced through the internal carotid artery to occlude the
origin of MCA. The occlusion suture was secured with onesilk suture at the stump of ECA, and the incision was closed.
After 90 min, animals were re-anesthetized, and the occlusion
suture was removed to allow reperfusion. For the embolic
model, the surgical procedure remained the same as in suture
model except that instead of the monofilament suture, a PE-10

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:171–180

catheter containing the clot was inserted through the ECA
stump to deliver the clot to the origin of the MCA and produce
occlusion. The clot was gently injected with 100 μl sterile
saline. Scanning laser Doppler (Pim-3, Perimed, ST) was used
to confirm a similar degree of drop in CBF among groups. The
percent drop in CBF after stroke was determined by comparing to baseline [24]. To monitor the ability of tPA to resolve
the blood clots and restore blood flow, CBF was measured 30,
60, and 120 min after tPA administration in animals subjected
to thromboembolic occlusion. Animals with reduction in CBF
less than 40 % or more than 75 % from baseline are excluded.
Evaluation of Infarct Size, Edema, HT, and Hemoglobin
Content
At 24 h, and just before sacrifice, animals were put into deep
sleep using isoflurane and subjected to intracardiac perfusion
with ice cold PBS to flush out blood from cerebral vessels.
Brains were isolated and sliced into seven coronal sections
marked A to G (+6.7 to −8.8 mm from the bregma). The
infarct size was measured after staining the brain slices with
2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) as previously described [23]. Edema was calculated as a percent (%) increase
in the ischemic hemisphere vs. the contralateral hemisphere.
The stained brain sections are then separated into ipsilateral
and contralateral hemispheres, snap frozen, and kept at −80 °C
for biochemical assays. Following brain homogenization, hemoglobin (Hb) content was measured with Quanti-Chrom kit
(BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA), 2007) and reported as
excess hemoglobin (mg/g protein) in the ischemic hemisphere
normalized to sham animals. A blinded investigator scored
macroscopic HT in brain slices B to E using a four-point rubric
(0—no hemorrhage; 1—dispersed individual petechiae; 2—
confluent petechiae; 3—small diffuse hemorrhage or hematoma; 4—large diffuse hemorrhage or hematoma) and the total
score for each animal was reported [25].
Evaluation of Neurobehavioral and Functional Outcomes
Neurobehavioral tests were assessed, recorded, and scored in a
blinded fashion as previously described [26]. Briefly, animals
were handled for 5–7 days prior to behavior testing in rooms
where behavior testing is to be carried out. Neurobehavioral
evaluation involved Bederson’s score, beam walk, and grip
strength tests. Behavior testing was performed before stroke
and at 24 h reperfusion, just before sacrifice. Bederson’s score
for each rat was obtained by using three parameters which
include (a) observation of no circling scored as 2, partial circling scored as 1, continuous circling scored as 0; (b) hindlimb
retraction; and (c) forelimb flexion scored as 1 or 0 according to
animal’s ability to immediately replace the limb upon pulling or
not, respectively. The resistance to push is also measured and
scored as 1 or 0, depending on whether the animal is able to

173

resist pushing or not. Maximum score of 7 is given to a normal
rat. Beam walking ability is graded based on a seven-point scale
method previously described [25]. Total composite neurological score out of 14 composed of sum of the Bederson’s score
and the scores obtained from the beam walking test. Forelimb
grip strength was measured with a standard grip strength meter
(Columbus Instrument, Columbus, OH).

Data Analysis
Data are presented as mean±SD. Data were examined
for outlying observations and nonparametric analyses
were used when needed. Area under the curve was determined for blood glucose from baseline to 24 h postischemia and for CBF as a percent of baseline using
NCSS 2007 (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT). The rCBF
values post-reperfusion were compared to prereperfusion values using a paired t test. The effects of
mild and severe hyperglycemia were determined using a
one-way ANOVA with three groups (control, mild HG,
and severe HG). An exact Kruskal-Wallis test was used
to analyze HT due to outlying values in the HG groups.
The effect of hyperglycemia and tPA treatment was
assessed using a 2 HG (no vs. yes) by 2 tPA (no vs.
yes) ANOVA where a significant interaction would indicate a differential effect of tPA on stroke outcomes
dependent on HG status. SAS© 9.3 (SAS, Inc., Cary,
NC) was used for all analyses. Statistical significance
was determined at alpha<0.05 and a Tukey’s post-hoc
test was used to compare means from significant
ANOVAs.

Results
The Impact of the Severity of Hyperglycemia
on Neurovascular Injury and Functional Outcomes
Administration of 30 and 60 % glucose solutions
achieved graded blood glucose levels of 140–200 and
240–350 mg/dl (Fig. 1a), respectively. Plasma osmolality was 309±3.2, 310±1.9, and 313±2 mosmol for the
control, mild HG, and severe HG groups, respectively.
There was no significant difference in plasma osmolality
between groups. The mortality was 10–15 % in each
group. The drop in CBF after occlusion was almost
the same among the different animal groups (Fig. 1b).
Mild elevation in blood glucose (140–200 mg/dl) did
not increase the infarct size when compared to control
animals. However, severe HG (240–350 mg/dl) caused a
significant increase in the infarct size (Fig. 1c).

The Impact of the Combination of Acute HG and tPA
in Suture and Thromboembolic Models of Hyperglycemic
Reperfusion on Neurovascular Injury and Functional
Outcomes
Since mild HG exacerbated HT and edema and worsened
functional outcomes, the next set of studies used this level of
HG to assess the impact of tPA and the method of reperfusion.
Administration of tPA did not affect blood glucose levels in
different stroke models (data not shown). There was no difference in percent drop in CBF measured immediately either
before reperfusion in the suture group or before tPA administration in the embolic group (Fig. 4a, b). In the thromboembolic model, laser Doppler monitoring showed that the first
remarkable reperfusion was 30 to 60 min after tPA administration and achieved only 40 to 60 % increase in CBF and this
level persisted after tPA reperfusion up till sacrifice (Fig. 4b).
tPA treatment did not affect the infarct size in either
normoglycemic or hyperglycemic animals when compared
to their non-treated counterparts, whether these animals were
subjected to suture or embolic occlusion (Fig. 5a, b). The
administration of tPA slightly but not significantly increased
the HT in control animals. However, the combination of HG

with tPA significantly exacerbated the cerebrovascular injury
and HT in the brain in both suture and embolic occlusion
models (Fig. 6a, b). The interaction between tPA and HG led
to a synergistic effect in exacerbating HT in animals subjected
to embolic stroke (interaction p value=0.029, Fig. 6b). The
intracerebral bleeding was further confirmed by assessing the
Hb content in the ischemic hemispheres. tPA administration
increased the Hb content in the ischemic hemispheres in both
normoglycemic and hyperglycemic animals irrespective of the
method of reperfusion (Fig. 6c, d). tPA administration also
increased edema in both suture and thromboembolic occlusion animal models (Fig. 6e, f).
tPA significantly reduced the grip strength and neurological
scores resulting in worse functional outcomes in
normoglycemic and hyperglycemic animals compared to untreated animals in both models of reperfusion. However, the
combination of tPA and HG significantly exacerbated the neurological deficits compared to each alone (Fig. 7a–d). The
neurological deterioration showed a similar pattern in both
suture and embolic occlusion models (Fig. 7a–d).

acute hyperglycemic stroke with regard to blood glucose
levels and use of tPA. Accordingly, this study was designed
to address the following points: (1) the impact of the severity
of acute HG on stroke outcomes using clinically relevant
blood glucose levels; (2) the impact of the interaction between
acute HG and tPA on neurovascular injury and functional
outcomes in different experimental stroke models that mimic
the clinical scenario; and (3) establishing a novel approach for
studying the hyperglycemia reperfusion injury in an embolic
stroke model with human tPA dose.
Clinically, HG is an independent predictor of poor functional outcomes for AIS patients. The TOAST trial showed
that higher admission blood glucose was associated with
worse clinical outcomes in patients with non-lacunar stroke
[27]. Admission HG was shown to be an independent predictor of poor neurological outcomes and increased rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in the NINDS and
ATLANTIS trials [28, 29]. The ECASS II trial also showed
that HG persisting for 24 h or more is an independent predictor
of poor clinical outcomes, ICH, and death in AIS patients [30,
31]. Moreover, HG aggravates tPA-induced cerebral hemorrhage in AIS patients [14, 15, 29]. Accordingly, several clinical trials were conducted to examine the safety, feasibility,
and efficacy of lowering blood glucose for hyperglycemic
AIS patients. The Treatment of HG in Ischemic Stroke
(THIS) and the Glucose Regulation in Stroke Patients
(GRASP) trials showed that, in these cohorts, blood glucose
levels range between 160 and 260 mg/dl at admission and they
targeted blood glucose levels of less than 130 and 110 mg/dl,
respectively [32, 33]. Based on the results of these feasibility
studies, the Stroke Hyperglycemia Insulin Network Effort

HG

(SHINE) trial is currently recruiting patients to examine the
efficacy and safety of blood glucose lowering in AIS patients
targeting blood glucose of 80–130 mg/dl [34]. However, evidence from clinical trials including The Normoglycemia in
Intensive Care Evaluation-Survival Using Glucose
Algorithm Regulation (NICE-SUGAR) and the Action to
Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trials
showed that intensive blood glucose lowering was associated
with worse outcome and increased mortality [35, 36]. The
incidence of hypoglycemia (<60 mg/dl) was the major cause
of adverse events and increased mortality. Blood glucose target <180 mg/dl resulted in less mortality than did a target of
80–108 mg/dl [35]. The UK Glucose Insulin in Stroke Trial
(GIST-UK) showed that tight glycemic control did neither
improve the mortality nor the neurologic impairment at
90 days in hyperglycemic AIS patients but the study was
terminated early due to slow recruitment [37]. These past
studies demonstrate the challenges in the field and emphasizes
the importance of the cautious and conservative control of
blood glucose in AIS patients.
While past preclinical studies provided very valuable information on the impact and mechanisms by which HG worsens
stroke outcomes, they used hyperglycemia models with much
higher blood glucose levels (350–500 mg/dl) than those observed in patients [7, 8, 19, 38]. To address this gap, in the
current study we used graded blood glucose levels that mimic
the clinical scenario. In this study, we found that mild elevation in blood glucose increased edema and HT without increasing the infarct size. This reflects the sensitivity and the
vulnerability of the vasculature to acute yet subtle changes in
blood glucose and also reflects the role the vasculature plays

178

in contributing to worse functional outcomes when there is no
further neuronal injury.
Our findings provide evidence that the severity of acute
HG is a determinant of functional outcome. Severe HG significantly increased the infarct size compared to control and
mild HG groups, and this was associated with worse functional outcomes. The major cause of this damage may be attributed to the increase in generation of reactive oxygen species
(superoxide and peroxynitrite) and inflammatory cytokines
(TNF alpha and interleukins) [1, 4, 6, 8, 39, 40]. Another
possibility may be increased osmolality. Bhardwaj et al.
showed that continuous infusion of hypertonic saline for
22 h increased plasma osmolality and this was associated with
an increase in the infarct volume after transient focal ischemia
in rats [41]. However, we did not observe a significant difference in plasma osmolality in the current study which may be
due to the small bolus dose of glucose solution that we used to
induce acute HG.
As recently reviewed, almost all the previous experimental
studies in acute hyperglycemic stroke research used the suture
occlusion model to induce stroke [7]. However, this model
allows abrupt reperfusion and prompt restoration of CBF to
the ischemic tissue, which may exacerbate the damage.
Moreover, it does not mimic what happens in ischemic stroke
patients where the ischemia is due to occlusion of cerebral
vessels by blood clots, which further increases risk of
microemboli formation and entrapment. In this translational
study, we used both suture and thromboembolic occlusion
models to recapitulate the clinical condition. Our findings show
that the infarct size is greater in the embolic model (most likely
due to longer occlusion). However, both models cause a similar
degree of HT and neurological deficit in acute HG, in spite of
the shorter occlusion time achieved with the suture model. This
is most probably due to the prompt reperfusion that takes place
in the suture model and flushes the ischemic tissue with a massive and sudden flow of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines. We recently reported that embolic stroke causes
less HT in a diabetic model as compared to suture occlusion and
suggested that gradual reperfusion that occurs in embolic stroke
may have lessened the injury [22]. Current results raise the
possibility that under diabetic conditions compensatory changes may limit the vascular injury.
Although the interaction between HG and tPA has been
shown to be detrimental to AIS patients, very few experimental studies were conducted to study this. The limited experimental studies with the embolic model used streptozotocininduced diabetes, not acute hyperglycemia, with very high
blood glucose levels. Based on early studies which reported
differences in rat’s fibrinolytic system [42], these studies used
a 10-fold higher dose of tPA (10 mg/kg) than that what is used
in ischemic stroke patients and reported increased intracerebral hemorrhage [16–19]. Recently, several groups used low
dose of tPA in combination with other drugs in order to

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:171–180

improve the outcomes and at the same time avoid the adverse
effects of high dose tPA. The combination of low dose tPA
(2.5 mg/kg) with annexin A2 (5 mg/kg) in rats subjected to
embolic stroke significantly improved CBF, reduced brain
infarction and HT [43]. A higher dosage regimen of 5 mg/kg
tPA/10 mg/kg annexin A2 was able to improve the long-term
neurological outcomes 1 month post-stroke [44]. These studies were conducted in normal animals. In the current study, we
used a low dose of tPA (1 mg/kg), which is almost the human
dose. We hypothesized that tPA treatment will reduce infarct
and improve outcomes in the control (NG) animals and expected greater HT and neurological deficits in the HG group.
However, we did not see a significant difference in infarct size
in animals receiving tPA as compared to vehicle group. This is
most probably because the tPA-induced reperfusion was not
sufficient to limit the infarct expansion even in the control
group. Prolonged monitoring of CBF demonstrated that the
low dose tPA given at 2 h post-occlusion was not able to fully
restore CBF which may have contributed to this finding. Past
studies reported lower [45] or similar infarct volumes [46–48]
as we observed in this study. In the current study, tPA increased bleeding and worsened functional outcome.
Lapergue et al. also reported increased HT after tPA treatment
in an embolic model but they did not report any functional
outcomes [47]. Several other studies showed increased BBB
permeability and there was no effect of tPA on functional
outcomes as compared to vehicle-treated groups [46, 49].
While we do not have a full explanation of poor outcomes
in the control group treated with tPA, there is a significant
increase in bleeding which may be responsible for poor outcomes. We also measured behavioral outcomes at 24 h while
injury is still evolving. Late time points may be needed to
address this concern.
The rationale to use tPA in the suture model was to assess
the effects of tPA on neuronal injury and HT irrespective of its
recanalization capability. Our results show that infarct size is
similar between vehicle- and tPA-treated animals suggesting
that Blow dose^ tPA does not have additional effects on cell
death (core formation) as previously reported [45, 47]. These
past studies either did not report HT and functional outcomes
or reported HT without functional outcomes. In the current
study, we show that tPA increased HT and worsened the outcome emphasizing the role of vascular injury on functional
outcomes. There are also studies which showed reduction in
infarct size with tPA. Berny-Lang et al. showed that tPA
(2.5 mg/kg) given early during MCAO (15 min after inducing
ischemia) reduced infarct size in mice but not rats with suture
occlusion. However, they did not report the infarct size when
they gave tPA 2 h after reperfusion [50]. Kilic et al. also
reported reduction in ischemic injury in mice when treated
with tPA 10 mg/kg during early MCAO [51]. These differences in outcomes may be due to the difference in dose and
timing of tPA treatment.

Conclusion and Limitations
Up to date, tPA remains to be the only therapeutic option for
AIS patients. Given that almost 50 % of stroke patients present
with HG, which aggravates the tPA-induced cerebral hemorrhage, there is a pressing need for more preclinical studies in
which important clinical questions can be addressed. For example, clinical studies suggest that women benefit more from
tPA therapy as compared to men [52]. While the use of only
healthy, male young animals and assessment of only shortterm outcomes remain to be limitations of the current study,
to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the interaction between tPA and acute HG in a clinically
relevant model of embolic stroke. This translational study is
also the first to compare the effects of acute HG in different
models of reperfusion injury.
