Abstract Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) often results in degeneration of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which can lead to
vasogenic edema and an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. Imatinib is an agent that may be able to protect the
BBB and reduce the risk of the harmful consequences of BBB
degeneration. We sought to measure the effect of Imatinib on
the BBB after experimental stroke longitudinally in vivo with
permeability dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Ischemia/
reperfusion injury was induced with a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion surgery. Rats were given Imatinib at 2
and 20 h after stroke onset. Post-assessment included neurologic functioning, MR imaging, Evans Blue extravasation,
Western blot, and immunohistology assay. Imatinib protected
the BBB by 24 h but failed to decrease BBB permeability at an
earlier time-point. Imatinib also reduced infarct volume, edema, and improved neurologic functioning by 24 h. Rats treated with Imatinib also had a higher expression of the BBB
structural protein Zona ocludens-1 and a reduction in nuclear
factor-kappa beta (NF-κβ) activation. Imatinib is a promising
agent to protect the BBB after AIS, but its effect on the BBB
may not become prominent until 24 h after the onset of
ischemia. This finding may help elucidate Imatinib’s role in

Introduction
After acute ischemic stroke (AIS) the blood–brain barrier
(BBB) can degenerate, leading to further complications. A
particularly devastating outcome of this degeneration is hemorrhagic transformation (HT) [1, 2]. Early BBB degeneration
after AIS is believed to be a precursor of HT [3]. Clinical
studies using permeability MRI have shown a correlation
between BBB permeability after AIS and the risk of eventual
HT [4, 5]. However, in cases of ischemic stroke that do not
progress to HT, degeneration of the BBB can still lead to
vasogenic edema, which results in neuronal death and impaired neurobehavioral recovery [6, 7]. A further correlate of
BBB degeneration after AIS is an increased extravasation of
neutrophils into the central nervous system (CNS) tissue,
which through the release of deleterious factors such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) can contribute to neuronal death
and further degeneration of the BBB [8, 9]. The BBB degeneration after AIS can persist, due to a chronic down regulation
of BBB structural proteins, particularly Zona occludens-1
(ZO-1) [10, 11]. Therefore, there is potential clinical utility
in agents that can protect the BBB after AIS.
One such agent is the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor, Imatinib [12–15]. Imatinib’s effect on
BBB permeability after AIS can be quantified with the ex vivo
Evans blue assay. Such dye-based ex vivo assays, however,
over-estimate permeability and have been criticized for inaccuracies due to the dye’s tendency to bind reversibly to serum
albumin [16]. A highly robust alternative is to assess BBB

40

permeability in vivo by analyzing the leakage of Gadolinium
from vessel to brain tissue using dynamic contrast-enhanced
(DCE) MRI [17]. This technique can be used to quantitatively
assess how Imatinib affects the BBB longitudinally after
experimental stroke and can be combined with in vivo assessment of brain edema, infarct size, and neurologic functioning.
Such a longitudinal assessment may provide insight into the
pathophysiologic evolution of AIS and the therapeutic window of Imatinib treatment.
In one study by Su et al. [13] Imatinib was shown to reduce
extravasation of Evans blue dye in a permanent occlusion
model, but this study was limited by the dye-based ex vivo
method to assess the BBB. Moreover, by using a permanent
occlusion model this study did not account for the substantial
effect of reperfusion injury and the inflammatory response on
the BBB [18, 19]. Experiments with a transient occlusion
model, which more accurately model reperfusion injury and
the inflammatory response, have not been done [20].
In the present study, we used the well-validated transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo) model of AIS to
assess how Imatinib affected the BBB. This study differed
from the previous study by Su et al. by delaying the administration of Imatinib, utilizing a transient occlusion model, and
utilizing a permeability MRI technique to quantify BBB permeability along with infarct size and edema in vivo at multiple
time-points.

Materials and Methods
Animals
The Animal Care Committee at the Hospital for Sick Children
approved all procedures for this study under the Canadian
Council of Animal Care guidelines. Male Sprague–Dawley
rats aged 59–67 days and 250–300 g in weight, were maintained in large cages under a 12-h light/dark cycle with temperature control (22 °C) and food/water available ad libitum.
Experimental Design
The experimental timelines for the imaging and ex vivo experiments are shown in Fig. 1. For the imaging experiment, 25
rats were randomized via coin toss into control and treatment
groups. Both groups underwent tMCAo surgery and the treatment group was given 100 mg/kg Imatinib mesylate
(Novartis) via tail-vein injection at 2 h after stroke onset and
an equivalent dose at 20 h to maintain the serum concentration. This dosage was chosen as it corresponds to the maximum indicated dose in humans [21]. An IV route of administration was chosen to mimic the clinical setting of AIS. Control rats were given equivalent volumes of saline at 2 and 20 h.
In vivo tests were as follows: neurologic scoring at 0.5, 5, and

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:39–49

24 h to quantify neurologic deficit; MRI at 5 and 24 h to assess
BBB permeability, infarct volume, and edema. Rats were
sacrificed at 24 h with an intra-peritoneal Euthanyl injection
and a subset underwent the Evans Blue assay to confirm BBB
permeability.
An additional seven rats underwent tMCAo surgery and
drug administration (three control and four treatment) but did
not undergo MRI. In this set of rats stroke was confirmed with
tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining after sacrifice and brain
tissue was collected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to quantify neutrophil presence in the CNS and Western blotting to
quantify nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κβ) activation and
expression of ZO-1. Researchers were blinded to group allocation for all experiments and assessments.
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (3 % induction, 1–2 %
maintenance). Focal ischemia was induced with the tMCAo
model [22] with the following modifications: A commercially
available silicone-coated suture measuring 0.3×5–6 mm
(Doccol, Sharon, MA, USA) was used as this type of suture
increases the reproducibility of stroke modeling [23]. The
occlusion was maintained for 1 h before the suture was carefully retracted for reperfusion. Temperature and heart rate
were measured continuously during the surgery. Rats were
given 2 ml of fluids subcutaneously immediately after the
surgery, and an additional 2 ml at 5 h after occlusion to reduce
dehydration secondary to decreased ambulatory ability. Postoperative pain relief was provided with Temgesic (0.03 mg/kg)
administered subcutaneously.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MR imaging included T2 (TR/TE=4,800/72 ms) and T1
(T1FLASH, TR/TE=500/3 ms), diffusion-weighted imaging
(DWI, with b=0.1000, TR/TE=1,000/33 ms), time-of-flight
magnetic resonance angiography (MRA; 2DTOF, TR/TE=
21.5/4.5 ms, slice=0.4 mm), and DCE imaging (discussed
below). All of these examinations were performed on a 3 T
system (Philips Achieva 3.0 T TX) using an eight-channel
wrist coil. Prior to each imaging session a catheter was
inserted into the tail-vein for injection of MR contrast media.
BBB permeability was estimated with the DCE sequence,
which was always performed after the structural data was
acquired. DCE imaging consisted of a T1-weighted dynamic
acquisition with the following parameters: TR/TE=6.3/2.2,
FOV=100×85 mm2, matrix=168×142, slice thickness=
1 mm, volumes=36, time=4:20 min, slices=12 (entire infarct
was covered). Gadolinium contrast agent was injected through
the tail vein at a rate of 60 μl over 12 s beginning 21 s after the
start of the DCE acquisition.

Image Analysis

to determine the midline boundary between hemispheres were
the falx cerebri, aqueductus cerebri, third ventricle, fissure
longitudinalis, and infundibulum. To quantify the extent of
the edema in each rat, the average hemispheric volume was
divided by the volume of the contralateral hemisphere.

MRI data were analyzed to determine reperfusion status of the
MCA, infarct volume, edema, and the permeability of the
BBB.
MRA images were analyzed visually in OsiriX (v5.6
Pixmeo, Switzerland). The anterior–posterior maximum intensity projection was used and inadequate reperfusion was
defined as an absent MCA signal within the infarcted
hemisphere.
BBB permeability was estimated from the DCE data using
in-house software (MR Analyst v2.1; University of Toronto,
Canada) written in MATLAB v.7.11 (Mathworks, Natick,
MA, USA). DCE images were co-registered to T2-weighted
anatomical images and symmetric ROIs were manually defined to encompass the infarcted tissue and a corresponding
region in the contralateral hemisphere. A third ROI was positioned within the sagittal sinus to determine the contrast agent
concentration in the blood. As described in previous studies,
voxel-by-voxel analysis of permeability was performed to
generate permeability constant (KPS) maps over the infarcted
regions and results are shown for representative animals from
the control and treatment groups in Fig. 2a [4, 5, 24]. Briefly, a
unidirectional two-compartment kinetic model was utilized to
model the relationship between the blood concentration–time
curve of the contrast agent and the mean tissue concentration
of the contrast agent [25]. KPS was expressed as ml/100 mg/
min. The KPS was then averaged over the infarcted tissue.
To determine infarct volume T2-weighted anatomical images were analyzed using OsiriX. Due to their higher resolution, the T2-weighted anatomical images offered better infarct
visualization and quantification than DWI anatomical images.
ROIs were manually defined on each slice encompassing the
infarcted tissue to determine the cross-sectional area. Crosssectional areas from all slices were summed to determine
infarct volume.
To estimate edema, a previously validated protocol was
used [26]. ROIs were manually defined on T2-weighted anatomical images on each slice encompassing the ipsilateral and
contralateral hemispheres. The cross-sectional areas were
summed across slices to give the total volume of the ipsilateral
and contralateral hemispheres. The anatomic landmarks used

Evans Blue Extravasation
In a subset of the rats that underwent MRI evans blue extravasation into the CNS tissue was assessed as previously described [27]. Briefly, 200 μl of 4 % Evans Blue solution in
saline was injected via the tail-vein 30 min prior to sacrifice.
Then, 100 mg of brain tissue was extracted from the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres and homogenized with
0.5 ml of formalin. The tissue was pelleted via centrifugation
and absorbance was measured in the supernatant at 610 nm to
quantify Evans Blue extravasation against a set of standards.
Levels of extravasated Evans Blue were expressed as ng of
Evans Blue per mg of tissue.
Neurologic Scoring
Neurologic scoring was completed with the modified Garcia
test as has been previously described [28]. Briefly, we
assessed spontaneous movement, symmetry of movement,
symmetry of forelimbs, trunk sensation, and vibrissae sensation to generate a score out of 15.
Histology
In the set of rats that did not undergo MRI, stroke was
confirmed with the TTC stain. After sacrifice rat brains were
extracted and quickly sectioned into 2-mm coronal slices over
ice. A slice was incubated in TTC dye at 37 °C for 15 min.
Rats with minimal or no infarcted tissue were excluded from
further ex vivo testing.
IHC for myeloperoxidase (MPO) and H&E staining was
performed by the staff at the Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology at the Hospital for Sick Children to assess neutrophil
levels. Tissue preparation methods were standardized inhouse and equivalent to those used for clinical specimens.
Briefly, a 2-mm slice of brain tissue was first dehydrated with

wax using a tissue processor (Miles Tissue Tek; Sakura
Finetek Inc., Torrance, CA, USA). Four 10-μm sections were
prepared from formalin fixed tissue samples. IHC was also
performed by the staff at the Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology using in-house methods. Slides were scanned at
0.23-μm resolution (Zeiss Mirax Scanner). Levels of neutrophils were manually quantified within each hemisphere in ten
random fields at 10× magnification per subject. Neutrophils
were identified as cells having intact segmented nuclei and
immunostaining around the periphery. Optical density measurements were also taken to quantify the MPO immunostaining within each hemisphere using the Image J software (NIH).

Statistics
Analyses were performed with the SPSS software v.18 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data was expressed as mean ±
standard deviation of the mean and significance was determined with Student's t-tests (two-tailed) unless otherwise
indicated. Neurologic scoring data was assessed with the
Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance, as this data is
ordinal and non-parametric. Sample sizes were calculated
based on estimates of effect size from a previous relevant
study [13].

Western Blots

Results

Fifty mg of brain tissue was extracted from the contralateral
and ipsilateral hemispheres, and whole-cell protein extracts
were prepared. Primary antibodies used were: Phospho-NFKappaB p65 (Ser536) (3033P, Cell Signaling) and ZO-1
(5406, Cell Signalling). Vinculin (5174P, Cell Signaling)
was used as a loading control. Infrared conjugated secondary
antibodies (LI-COR) were used and quantified using an Odyssey infrared imaging system.

Twenty-five rats underwent tMCAo and MR imaging. MRA
revealed inadequate reperfusion in the MCA of two control
rats and one treated rat. In addition, T1-weighted MR imaging
at 5 h revealed intra-cerebral hemorrhage in one control rat
and three treated rats. These rats were excluded from further
analysis. Final group sizes for the imaging experiments were
nine control rats and nine treated rats. Four rats from each
group underwent Evans Blue staining ex vivo.

Transl. Stroke Res. (2015) 6:39–49

A further seven rats underwent tMCAo and TTC staining
after sacrifice at 24 h. Final group sizes for the IHC and
Western blotting experiments were four control and four treated rats (one control rat from the imaging experiment was
used).
Physiologic Parameters
Physiologic parameters are summarized in (Table 1). All of
the rats undergoing tMCAo lost approximately 7 % to 13 % of
their body weight over the 24-h recovery period. Weight loss
did not differ between the treatment and control groups at any
time-point (p>0.05). In all rats there was a transient increase
in temperature by 0.9–1.2 °C after MCAO and temperatures
returned to the normal range (36.1–36.9 °C) by 5 h after
MCAO. There was no difference in temperatures between
the control and treated groups at any time-point (p>0.05).
All rats experienced a transient increase in heart rate by 72–
126 beats/min (bpm) during the tMCAo surgery. By 24 h the
heart rate in all rats had returned to the normal range (364±
34 bpm). There was no difference in temperatures between the
control and treated groups at any time-point (p>0.05).
Imatinib Treatment Reduced Blood–Brain Barrier
Permeability
Permeability MR imaging at 5 h revealed that KPS did not
differ significantly between the treatment and control groups
(Fig. 2a). By the end-point of 24 h, however, KPS was
significantly (p<0.05, one-tailed) lower in the rats treated with
Imatinib (0.10±0.03 ml/100 mg/min for the treatment group
vs. 0.17±0.06 ml/100 mg/min for the control group). A onetailed t-test was justified in this instance because of the previous indication of beneficial treatment effect [13].
As KPS is an in vivo estimate of BBB permeability we
utilized the Evans Blue assay to confirm these results at the
24-h time-point (Fig. 2b). At 24 h, the rats treated with
Imatinib had significantly (p<0.05, one-tailed) reduced extravasation of Evans Blue dye into the CNS tissue (0.49±
0.03 ng/mg in the treatment group vs. 0.57±0.08 ng/mg in the
control group, n=4). There was a moderate correlation (R2 =
0.432, p<0.05) between DCE-MRI and Evans blue extravasation measurements.
The KPS was not homogenous across the infarcted areas
(Fig. 2c). KPS was higher in the core of the infarct and lower
in the periphery.
Imatinib Treatment Reduces Infarct Volume and Edema
Control and treated rats subjected to a 1-h tMCAo surgery
exhibited infarction in the right brain hemisphere at 5 and
24 h, as seen with hyper intensity on T2-weighted and
diffusion-weighted MR imaging (Fig. 3a). In all animals,

43

infarction was present throughout the basal ganglia at both
the 5- and 24-h time-points. Specifically, the infarct consistently affected the internal capsule and the middle and posterior portions of the caudoputamen.
Figure 3b shows that in T2-weighted imaging at 5 h infarct
volume did not differ significantly between the treatment and
control groups (161.1±18.3 vs. 171.4±14.4 mm3, respectively; p=0.21). By the end-point of 24 h, however, infarct volume was significantly (p<0.05) lower in the rats treated with
Imatinib (222.7±60.7 mm3 for the treatment group vs. 293.1±
85.8 mm3 for the control group). Cortical infarct volumes
were 188.7±27.1 and 130.2±24.4 mm3 for the control and
treatment groups, respectively (p<0.05). Subcortical infarct
volumes were 104.4±41.2 and 92.5±33.4 mm3 for the control
and treatment groups, respectively (p=0.11). Visually, we
observed that Imatinib had reduced growth of the infarct into
the cortical tissue.
(Fig. 3c) shows that edema at 24 h, as assessed by compression factor on T2-weighted images, was significantly
(p<0.05) lower in the Imatinib treated rats (1.02±0.04 for
the treatment group vs. 1.07±0.05 for the control group).
Visually we observed that midline structures (falx cerebri,
aqueductus cerebri, third ventricle, fissure longitudinalis, and
infundibulum) were slightly displaced into the contralateral
hemisphere in both control and Imatinib-treated rats.
Imatinib Increases Neurologic Recovery After
Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury
Marked neurologic impairment was observed in all rats at 0.5
and 5 h (Fig. 3d). In all rats, neurologic score had improved by
24 h but did not return to baseline value. Imatinib-treated rats
showed significantly (p<0.05) improved neurologic score at
24 h (10.5±0.95 in the treatment group vs. 9±0.81 in the
control group). No significant difference in neurologic score
was seen between the treated and control groups before
tMCAo or at 0.5 or 5 h after tMCAo (p>0.05).
Imatinib Treatment Correlates with Reduced NF-κβ
but Neutrophil Infiltration Is Unaffected
Because increased BBB permeability can correlate with neutrophil infiltration into the CNS, we measured the effect of
Imatinib on neutrophil infiltration. Infiltrating neutrophils and
MPO staining was seen in the ischemic regions of all rats that
underwent tMCAo surgery at 24 h, as indicated in IHC slides
(Fig. 4b). The contralateral hemispheres had low levels of
neutrophils and a basal level of MPO staining. The infarcted
hemispheres of Imatinib-treated rats showed a 18 % reduction
in neutrophils but this measurement did not reach statistical
significance (p=0.14, n=4) (Fig. 4a). The infiltrating neutrophils were not evenly distributed throughout the infarct but

were concentrated around blood vessels and the borders of the
infarct (Fig. 4b).
We measured the effect of Imatinib on NF-κβ activation
after ischemia/reperfusion injury because activation of this
complex can correlate with BBB permeability and Imatinib
has been shown to affect NF-κβ activation in disease models
other than AIS [29]. The infarcted hemispheres of all rats
showed significantly increased levels of activated NF-κβ in
comparison to the contralateral hemispheres (p<0.0001). The
Imatinib-treated rats, however, had a 33 % decreased activation of NF-κβ in the infarcted hemisphere as seen with Western blot (p<0.05, n=4) (Fig. 5a).

Imatinib Treatment Increases ZO-1 Expression
Since Imatinib had reduced BBB permeability by 24 h, we
chose to measure the level of the junctional protein ZO-1 at
this time-point as this protein can be assessed a marker of

BBB structural integrity [10]. The infarcted hemispheres of all
rats showed significantly reduced levels of ZO-1 in comparison to the contralateral hemispheres (p<0.01). The Imatinibtreated rats, however, had a 35 % increased expression of ZO1 in the infarcted hemisphere as seen with Western blot
(p<0.05, n=4) (Fig. 5b).

Discussion
The onset of cerebral ischemia triggers a complex set of
responses, which can lead to BBB degeneration, and HT [2].
Therapeutic intervention after stroke has the goal of
interrupting these responses so as to reduce the harmful effects
of cerebral ischemia. In the present study, we used permeability MRI to demonstrate that Imatinib protected the BBB at
24 h but not at an earlier time-point of 5 h. Although Imatinib

presents a valuable strategy to mitigate the risks of BBB
degeneration after AIS, its efficacy may be limited immediately after an ischemic event.
Imatinib Treatment Reduced BBB Permeability and Increased
Levels of ZO-1
The change in KPS and Evans Blue extravasation both demonstrated that Imatinib had resulted in reduced BBB

permeability by 24 h. However, BBB permeability was not
reduced at the earlier time-point of 5 h. This suggested that
Imatinib’s effect on the BBB varied over the first 24 h after
ischemia/reperfusion injury. Our results indicated that Imatinib might not reduce the risks associated with increased BBB
permeability such as HT and vasogenic edema immediately
after AIS. But by 24 h Imatinib may begin to mitigate these
risks, because this is when the BBB protecting effect of
Imatinib became prominent. The risk of HT is known to be

high at both 5 and 24 h after AIS, but it is not well understood
precisely how this risk evolves with time. In addition, our
results suggest that it may be possible to administer Imatinib at
a later time-point than 2 h and still achieve protection of the
BBB by 24 h.
Zona occludins-1 is a vital BBB structural protein involved
in both occludin and tight-junction formation. Zona
occludins-1 has been shown to be particularly abundant in
the peripheral tight junctions of the BBB and can be measured
alone as a marker of tight junction integrity after ischemia
reperfusion injury [10, 11]. Previous studies have shown that
ischemia/reperfusion injury caused a decreased expression of
the ZO-1 tight-junction protein [11, 30]. Our results confirmed
this finding, but also showed that Imatinib had caused an
increase in ZO-1 expression by 24 h. Taken together, these
results suggested that Imatinib might be able to protect the
BBB and increase tight junction integrity through a mechanism involving increased ZO-1 levels. Future studies may also
examine the effect of Imatinib on other BBB structural proteins such as the occludins and claudin-5.
Imatinib Treatment Increases Tissue Preservation
and Improves Neurologic Functioning
We observed that infarct volumes grew over the first 24 h after
the onset of cerebral ischemia. This was in line with previous
studies, which have shown that over the first 24 h, infarct
volume grows to >80 % of the size achieved by 72 h [31]. At
24 h, we observed that Imatinib had reduced infarct volumes
by 24 % compared to the control group. This strengthened the
results of a previous study, which demonstrated that
200 mg/kg of Imatinib reduced infarct volume by 34 % when
given 1 h after stroke onset in a permanent occlusion model
[13]. Our study differed from this previous study as we used a
transient occlusion model and first gave Imatinib at a later
time-point (2 h) and at a lower dose (100 mg/kg). Structural
MR imaging showed that, while the MCA territory was consistently infarcted in both control and treated rats, Imatinib had
reduced the infarct growth beyond the MCA vascular territory
(Fig. 2a).
Neurologic deficit after stroke is often the result of both
neuronal death and increased intra-cranial pressure due to
edema [32]. In support of this, we observed that an improvement in neurologic functioning at 24 h in the Imatinib-treated
rats was accompanied by a reduction in infarct volume and
edema.

47

Imatinib Treatment Reduces NF-κβ Activation
but Neutrophil Infiltration Is Unaffected
At the level of transcriptional regulation an important mechanism of immune activation and subsequent BBB degeneration is the NF-κβ. The activation of NF-κβ is seen in a
variety of CNS disease models including transient focal
ischemia, global ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and
intra-cerebral hemorrhage [33, 34]. NF-κβ activation after
transient focal ischemia can lead to increased inflammatory
cytokine release, which may promote BBB degeneration
through a variety of mechanisms [35]. Evidence for this
comes from studies demonstrating that NF-κβ inhibition
results in increased neuronal survival and a reduction of
harmful inflammatory responses [36]. Interestingly, however, complete NF-κβ inactivation has been shown to lead
to a reduction in anti-apoptotic genes and increased cell
death after tMCAo in rats [37]. Complete inactivation of
NF-κβ seems to be neurotoxic, while partial NF-κβ inhibition can interfere with diapedesis of inflammatory leukocytes into the CNS and seems to be neuroprotective. We
evaluated NF-κβ activation and found this to be reduced but
not eliminated with Imatinib treatment. Imatinib has been
shown to cause a reduction in NF-κβ activation in conditions other than AIS [29]. This may be mediated through
inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway although further work
is needed to investigate this mechanism [38].
Increased BBB permeability can often correlate with neutrophil infiltration. Studies in rodent models show that neutrophils first appear in the CNS tissue at 2 h after vessel
reperfusion and peak at 24–48 h [39]. This resembles the
inflammatory response seen in human stroke [40]. Permanent
models of focal ischemia do not show significant neutrophil
infiltration. Activated neutrophils in the CNS tissue release a
variety of deleterious compounds, including inflammatory
cytokines, ROS, and activators of arachadonic acid cascades
[41]. In the tMCAo model, neutrophil levels in the CNS
correlate with infarct size, and suppression of neutrophil activity is neuroprotective, indicating that activated neutrophils
in the CNS are partially responsible for cell death in the
delayed phase [39]. In addition, many CNS neutrophils express matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), which is known to
contribute to BBB degeneration and HT after ischemic stroke
[8]. Imatinib resulted in a reduction in CNS neutrophils at
24 h, but this comparison did not achieve statistical significance. Previous studies have shown that neutrophil infiltration
is a major cause of BBB permeability after AIS. Our findings
indicated that Imatinib was able to protect the BBB in the
absence of a significant reduction in neutrophil infiltration.
This finding is similar to a previous study on rodent spinal
cord injury, which showed that Imatinib protected the spinal
BBB but did not affect neutrophil infiltration into the spinal
cord [12].

In conclusion, we have utilized the non-invasive permeability MRI technique to demonstrate that Imatinib’s protective effect on the BBB is present by 24 h after occlusion but
not at the earlier time-point of 5 h. As a result, Imatinib’s
beneficial effect may be limited immediately after AIS. Nonetheless, Imatinib is a common and relatively cost-effective
therapeutic that shows promise to protect the BBB and reduce
the risk of HT and vasogenic edema in the acute stage of AIS.
Before this can occur, there is a need for additional supporting
evidence and optimization. Future studies may establish a
dose response and examine the effect of combined thrombolytic and Imatinib therapy.
