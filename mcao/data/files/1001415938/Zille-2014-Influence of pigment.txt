We here suggest that pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) does not have an
effect on lesion size, behavioral outcome, cell proliferation, or cell death after
striatal ischemia in the mouse. PEDF is a neurotrophic factor with neuroprotective,
antiangiogenic, and antipermeability effects. It influences self-renewal of neural
stem cells and proliferation of microglia. We investigated whether intraventricular
infusion of PEDF reduces infarct size and cell death, ameliorates behavioral
outcome, and influences cell proliferation in the one-hour middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia. C57Bl6/N mice were
implanted with PEDF or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (control) osmotic pumps and
subjected to 60-minute MCAO 48 hours after pump implantation. They received
daily BrdU injections for 7 days after MCAO in order to investigate cell proliferation.
Infarct volumes were determined 24 hours after reperfusion using magnetic
resonance imaging. We removed the pumps on day 5 and performed behavioral
testing between day 7 and 21. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to
determine the effect of PEDF on cell proliferation and cell death. Our model
produced an ischemic injury confined solely to striatal damage. We detected no
reduction in infarct sizes and cell death in PEDF- vs. CSF-infused MCAO mice.
Behavioral outcome and cell proliferation did not differ between the groups.
However, we cannot exclude that PEDF might work under different conditions in
stroke. Further studies will elucidate the effect of PEDF treatment on cell
proliferation and behavioral outcome in moderate to severe ischemic injury in the
brain.

PEDF Effects on Striatal Cerebral Ischemia

Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the Western societies.
Despite the increasing need, the only effective therapy is thrombolysis with
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. However, only 7% of the patients can
benefit in a time window of up to 4.5 hours [1].
Neurotrophic factors, including pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), are
of increasing interest for therapy. Along with other effects, they prevent
initialization of cell death while promoting differentiation of neuronal progenitor
cells [2].
The endogenous role of PEDF in the CNS has not yet been completely
determined. Its known effects include neurotrophism, neuroprotection, antitumorigenesis, and antiangiogenesis [3]. PEDF is produced in most mammalian
tissues, including the brain [4–6]. It was found in striatum [7], cerebellum [8],
hippocampus and hypothalamus [9] as well as cerebral cortex [9–11].
PEDF is neuroprotective after a variety of neuronal injuries [12]. In particular,
it prevented neuronal cell death in cell culture and to rescue cultured neurons
from glutamate- and 6-hydroxydopamine-induced toxicity [13–15]. Intrinsic
PEDF protein and mRNA were downregulated after permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) in the rat [16]. In a study using transient MCAO in the
rat, gene transfer of PEDF significantly decreased infarct size and edema,
attenuated cell death, and reduced inflammation [8].
The mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of PEDF upon ischemic
injury in the brain are poorly understood. One possible mechanism might be its
role in cell proliferation. In the brain, PEDF promoted self-renewal of adult
neuronal stem cells [17]. Similarly, PEDF increased metabolic activity in microglia
while blocking proliferation. In astrocyte-microglia co-cultures, PEDF did not
change the metabolic activity of astrocytes, but their proliferation was inhibited
[18]. PEDF also improved survival of cultured embryonic cerebellar granule cells,
whereas there was no effect on cell proliferation [13]. PEDF upregulation induced
by mamentine (an NMDA receptor antagonist) increased cell proliferation of
hippocampal progenitors. Such an effect was not replicated overexpressing PEDF
using an adeno-associated virus [19]. On the other hand, PEDF expression was
reduced or absent in glioma [4] and transient PEDF expression decreased the
proliferation of cancer cells in the brain [20].
We here investigated whether intraventricular infusion of PEDF reduces infarct
size and cell death, ameliorates behavioral outcome, and influences cell
proliferation in the one-hour MCAO model in the mouse. We chose the MCAO
model because it is well established in our lab and the most commonly used
experimental model of focal cerebral ischemia. We implanted mice with PEDF or
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF, control) osmotic pumps and subjected to 60minute MCAO 48 hours after pump implantation. To investigate cell proliferation, mice received daily BrdU injections for 7 days after MCAO. We also
determined infarct size, behavioral outcome, and cell death. Under our
experimental conditions, PEDF did not have an effect on lesion size, behavioral

outcome, cell proliferation, or cell death upon ischemic injury confined to striatal
injury.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Animals
Animal experiments were performed in consent with national and international
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (Tierschutzgesetz der
Bundesrepublik Deutschland, European directive, as well as GV-SOLAS and
FELASA guidelines and recommendations for laboratory animal welfare) and
approved by an ethics committee (Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin,
Germany, permit number: G 0270/10).
Eight- to eleven-week-old Male C57BL6/N mice were acquired from Charles
River Laboratories, Germany. We treated animals with respect to the German
Animal Welfare Act and the European Council Directive 86/609/EEC concerning
the protection of experimental animals. Animals were housed in groups of 3-6 per
cage with a 12/12 hours light/dark cycle controlled environment and given ad
libitum access to food and water.

Experimental Design and Exclusion Criteria
All experimental procedures were performed by investigators blinded to the
experimental conditions. Animals were randomly assigned to the experimental
groups. The experimental design is depicted in Figure 1.
Twelve mice weighing 19 to 24 g at the time of operation underwent osmotic
pump implantation followed by MCAO with an interval of two days. We removed
the pumps 7 days after implantation, i.e. 5 days after MCAO. We performed T2weighed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 24 hours after MCAO. From day 7
to day 21 after MCAO, animals underwent behavioral testing. Besides, from day 0
to day 7 post-MCAO, we injected Bromo-deoxy-Uridine (BrdU) intraperitoneally
on a daily basis for immunohistochemical analysis of cell proliferation.
Accordingly, we sacrificed the mice and extracted their brains for tissue analysis
on day 21 after MCAO.
We chose the behavioral test battery and time points for the tests based on own
previous results using these tests in MCAO animals [21] and the literature (for an
extensive review on assessing post-stroke behavior in the mouse see Balkaya et al
[22]). We used Open Field test on day 7 to evaluate exploratory locomotion and
anxiety. Pole test on day 9 and rotarod on day 10 were chosen to assess motor
function. Using Morris Water Maze (MWM), we investigated spatial learning and
memory. We performed training for MWM for seven days prior to probe trial on
day 21.
Two animals were excluded from the experiment because they had no lesion
identified on MRI 24 hours after MCAO. One brain of the PEDF group was
excluded from the histochemical analysis due to bad tissue quality.

Figure 1. Experimental Design. Mice underwent osmotic pump implantation two days prior to MCAO.
Starting at the day of the MCAO, mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of Bromo-deoxy-Uridine (BrdU)
for 7 days. 24 hours after reperfusion, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. On
day 5 after MCAO, osmotic pumps were removed. Animals underwent behavioral testing: Open Field test at
day 7, Pole test at day 9, rotarod at day 10, and Morris Water Maze (MWM) with seven days of training prior to
probe trial on day 21. Then, animals were sacrificed and brains were extracted for immunohistochemical
analysis.

Osmotic Pump Implantation
We primed micro-osmotic Alzet pumps (model 1007D) under sterile conditions
one day before implantation and left them in an incubator at 37.0 ˚C overnight.
We anesthetized the animals with a ketamine (Ketavet, Pfizer, Germany, 150 mg/
kg) and xylazine (Rompun, Bayer, Germany, 15 mg/kg) mixture dissolved in
8.5 ml of sterile 0.9% saline. Head skin incision was performed exposing the skull.
We implanted the cannula 0.2 mm to the right from Bregma corresponding to
the location of the right ventricle. A drop of cyanoacrylate clay (Weicon,
Germany) was introduced between the cannula cap and the skull. We slowly
moved the cannula down until the cap touched the skull. We left the animals for
5 min to ensure drying of the clay. Then, we carefully sutured the skin above the
cannula with a 5–0 polypropilen thread (Ethicon, USA).
Animals received lidocaine gel (Xylocain, AstraZeneca, Germany) locally and
0.5 ml of ringer lactate solution (B Braun Melsungen, Germany) intraperitoneally
to substitute the liquid loss. We placed the cage with operated animals onto the
37 ˚C warm bed for 2 hours.
The animals received a total amount of 84¡16.8 ml of PEDF (20 mg/ml in CSF)
or CSF at a pumping rate of 0.5¡0.1 ml/hour.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
We induced transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) by inserting a
silicone rubber-coated 190 mm thick monofilament (Doccol Corporation,
Redlands, USA) through an incision in the left common carotid artery into the
internal carotid artery as described by Engel and colleagues [23]. Mice were
anesthetized with 1.5% Isoflurane in a 2/3 N2O and 1/3 O2 mixture and kept
under anesthesia during the whole operation procedure. After 60 min of ischemia,
we re-anesthetized the animals and removed the filament to permit reperfusion.

PEDF Effects on Striatal Cerebral Ischemia

Mice were treated with Lidocain (Xylocain, AstraZeneca, Germany) as a local
anesthesia directly after and around 6 hours after surgery. During surgery and
ischemia, we measured their body temperature and kept it constant between 37.0
and 37.5 ˚C with a heating pad. After surgery, the animals were allowed to wake up
in a warming cage and kept there for around 2 hours. MCAO was confirmed by
observing the animals circling after operation and by MRI at 24 hours.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
24 hours after MCAO, mice were scanned in a 7 Tesla Pharmascan 70/16 (Bruker
Biospin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a 16 cm horizontal bore
magnet and a 9 mm (inner diameter) shielded gradient (300 Mhz H-resonance
frequency, maximum gradient strength 300 mT/m, rise time 80 ms). We carried
out data acquisition and image processing with the Bruker software (Paravision
4.0).
For the examination, animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (2.5% for
induction, 1.5% for maintenance, Forene, Abbot, Wiesbaden, Germany) in 70%
N2O and 30% O2 via a facemask under constant ventilation monitoring (Small
Animal Monitoring & Gating System, SA Instruments, Stony Brook, New York,
USA). We kept their body temperature constant at 37 ˚C during measurement
using a heated circulating water blanket.
For imaging the mouse brain, we used a T2-weighted 2D turbo spin-echo
sequence (TR/TE: 4200/36 ms, rare factor 8, 4 averages). Twenty 0.5 mm-hick
axial slices over the brain from olfactory bulb to cerebellum were imaged with a
field of view of 2.5662.56 cm and a matrix size of 2566256, resulting in a
nominal voxel size of 98 mm698 mm. The acquisition of the T2-weighted images
lasted 6 min 43 s.

Infarct volumetry and edema assessment
We processed the images acquired during magnetic resonance scanning with
ImageJ v1.42 (NIH, Bethesda, USA) and Analyze 5.0 (BIR, Mayo Clinic, USA)
software. We outlined ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres as well as the
ischemic infarct represented by hyperintense areas in T2-weighted images where
present in each of the 20 slices. To estimate the infarct volume, we applied a
correction for edema by calculating the ‘indirect’ infarct volume as the volume of
the contralateral hemisphere minus the non-infarcted volume of the ipsilateral
hemisphere. In order to assess the contribution of the edema, the percentage
volume increase of the ipsilateral compared to the contralateral hemisphere was
calculated.

BrdU injection
Mice received daily intraperitoneal BrdU injections of 50 mg per kg body weight
(diluted in 0.9% NaCl-solution) over a period of 7 days as of the day of MCAO.

Open Field Test
The open field test is comprised of an unfamiliar open field, which is an
undifferentiated square of 50650 cm surrounded by high walls. On day 7 after
MCAO, mice were given one trial each in which they were allowed to explore
freely for 10 min. We monitored locomotor activity using a video tracking system
(VideoMot 2 v.5.68, TSE, Bad Homburg, Germany and black/white CCD Camera,
Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany). We recorded the total distance each
mouse traveled and time spent in the open center of 35635 cm.

Pole Test
Pole test was performed as previously described [24], with minor modifications.
The test apparatus consisted of a vertical steel pole covered with tape (Durapore,
3 M) to create a rough surface. On day 9 after MCAO, we placed the mice head
upward on the top of the pole. We recorded the time the mouse took to turn
completely head downwards and the total time it took to descend down and reach
the floor with its front paws. If the animal was unable to turn completely, we
attributed the time to reach the floor to t turn, too. We performed the test four
times and used the mean of the four trials for statistical analysis.

Rotarod
We performed Rotarod as previously described [25]. On day 10 after MCAO, we
placed the mice on an accelerating rotating rod (from 4 to 40 rpm over 300 s) and
their latency to fall was recorded. We performed the test three times and used the
mean of the three trials for statistical analysis.

Morris Water Maze Test
Experiments were performed as described with minor modifications [26–28]. A
120-cm-diameter, we filled a 60-cm-high circular swimming pool to a depth of
32 cm with 20 ˚C opaque water. We placed visible cues on the walls of the pool,
which remained on their fixed position throughout the whole experiment. A clear
Plexiglas platform with a diameter of 11 cm was submerged 1 cm below the water
level.
A full experiment had two phases: a place task (learning period) with three
trials per day for seven consecutive days (day 14–20 after MCAO) and a probe
trial (spatial probe) on the eighth day (day 21 after MCAO). For the place task, we
placed the platform near the center of a quadrant and released the mice into the
water from one of the three remaining quadrants to search for the platform. If
after 90 s an animal did not reach the platform, we guided it to the platform. After
reaching the platform, we allowed the animals to remain there for 30 s. The
intertrial interval was 1.5 min, and we dried the mice with a towel and put under a
heating lamp between each trial to avoid hypothermia.

PEDF Effects on Striatal Cerebral Ischemia

We recorded escape latencies to find the platform, total distance traveled and
swim speed with a computer-based system (VideoMot 2 v.5.68, TSE, Bad
Homburg, Germany and black/white CCD Camera, Robert Bosch GmbH,
Stuttgart, Germany). We used the mean of the three trials per day for statistical
analysis. In the probe trial, we allowed the mice to swim freely for 90 s in the
absence of the platform. We measured the time spent in each quadrant and
crosses through the location of the former platform.

Immunohistochemistry
For all immunohistochemistry analyses, animals were anesthetized and perfused
transcardially with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% PFA in saline. Brains were
extracted and kept in PFA solution for 2 hours, then transferred into 30% sucrose
and snap-frozen. 20 mm thick coronal slices were cut using a cryostat (HM560,
Microm, Germany) and every second section was preserved. We arranged slices
on glass slides (six sections with a distance of 1 mm from Bregma 2.1 to 23.4).
We kept the slides at 220 ˚C until used for immunohistochemistry.
For BrdU histochemistry, we washed the cryo sections twice in PBS for 10 min
each followed by treatment with 0.6% H2O2 for 30 min and brief rinsing
afterwards. The sections were incubated in a pre-warmed 2 N HCl solution for
30 min at 37 ˚C. We then washed the sections with 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 8.5)
for 10 min. After 26 washing with PBS, the sections were incubated in blocking
solution (3% donkey serum in PBS/Tween 0,1%) for 1 hour to block unspecific
binding of primary anti-BrdU antibody. Thereafter, we incubated the sections
with rat anti-BrdU antibody (1:500, AbD Serotec, OBT 0030) overnight at 4 ˚C.
On the next day, after washing, we treated the sections again with blocking
solution for 10 min and incubated them with biotinylated donkey anti-rat
antibody (1:250, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, 712-065-150) for
2 hours at RT. After washing, we incubated the sections with ABC-HRP kit for
2 hour and washed again. The reaction was developed by incubating with DAB for
6–10 min and after washing, the sections were mounted.
For double stainings, we washed the slices twice in PBS and incubated in prewarmed 2 N HCl solution for 30 min at 37 ˚C. We subsequently neutralized with
0.1 M borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 10 min. The slices were then incubated in
blocking solution for 1 hour and stained with rat anti-BrdU antibody (1:500, AbD
Serotec, OBT0030) together with either mouse anti-GFAP antibody (1:100,
Millipore, MAB360), goat anti-Iba1 antibody (1:100, Abcam, ab5076) or mouse
anti-NeuN antibody (1:50, Millipore, MAB377) primary antibodies overnight at
4 ˚C.
On the next day, after washing, we treated the sections again with blocking
solution for 10 min. Then, we incubated them with the appropriate secondary
antibodies (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories if not otherwise
indicated): anti-rat-Cy3 (1:100, 712-165-153) and either anti-mouse-DyLight488
(1:50, 715-485-151) or anti-goat-DyLight549 (1:100, 705-505-003). For BrdU/
NeuN double stainings, we used the secondary antibodies anti-rat-DyLight488

PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0114595 December 3, 2014

PEDF Effects on Striatal Cerebral Ischemia

(1:50, 712-485-150) and anti-mouse-DyLight549 (1:50, 715-505-150).
Counterstaining was done with DAPI (1:100, 5 mg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, D9564).

TUNEL
To determine the impact of PEDF on cell death, we performed TUNEL using
ApopTag kit (Millipore, USA, Catalogue Number: S7165) according to the
protocol given. Briefly, we fixed the cryosections in 1% PFA for 10 min at room
temperature and postfixed them in ethanol-acetic acid mixture (2:1) for 5 min in
220 ˚C. After washing in PBS, specimens were shortly (10 s) incubated with
equilibration buffer supplied with the kit and afterwards incubated with TdT
enzyme solution for 1 hour at 37 ˚C. We then applied stop/wash buffer, washed
the specimens and incubated them for 30 min with rhodamine at room
temperature. We washed the specimens again in PBS, mounted them with a
mounting medium and coverslipped the specimens.

Fluorescence Microscopy and Image Assessment
Immunohistochemistry stainings were analyzed with a microscope (Olympus BX61, USA) and Cell ‘ P software. Pictures were taken at 1006 magnification, with
field size 0.6860.89 mm. Images were quantitatively analyzed in Cell‘P software.
For BrdU, we counted the cells on two slices per animal. For cortex and
striatum four fields of view per slice and for subventricular zone (SVZ) and
dentate gyrus the whole area was investigated according to the counting method
of Weidner and colleagues [29]. For the SVZ, we counted the cells in a distance of
50 mm from the ventricle. For double stainings, we counted the cells in the whole
striatum on one slice per animal.
For TUNEL, we counted the cells on ipsilateral and contralateral striatum on
four slices with a distance of 1 mm each. We used the whole striatum on each
slide for analysis. We divided the number of cells by the area in which we counted
the cells to obtain cells/mm2. Then, we subtracted the number of cells in
contralateral striatum from ipsilateral striatum and calculated the mean for each
animal.

Statistical Analysis
We tested normality using graphical methods and confirmed them by
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Variance homogeneity was evaluated using Levené
test. When data were normally distributed, variance homogeneity was met and
two independent groups were investigated, student’s t-test was performed. In case
of comparing two groups with repeated measures, we performed ANOVA with
Box’s M test for equality of covariance matrices and Levené test for variance
homogeneity. Data are represented as mean ¡ standard deviation. Differences are
considered significant at p,.05. We performed all statistical analyses with SPSS
v.19.0.

Results
PEDF Treatment Does Not Affect Lesion Size After Striatal
Ischemic Injury
Mice underwent aCSF or PEDF pump implantation as well as MCAO two days
afterwards. 24 hours after MCAO, we performed T2-weighted MRI. For both
lesion volume and edema, data were normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test, Z5.743, p5.639 for lesion volume, Z5.599, p5.866 for edema) and
variances were homogenous across groups (Levené test, F(1,8)51.171, p5.311 for
lesion volume, F(1,8)52.718, p5.138 for edema).
Mean lesion volumes were 17.9¡5.8 and 22.3¡12.0 mm3 for CSF and PEDF
(n55 per group) respectively. There was no significant difference between the
groups (independent t test, t(8)52.728, p5.487, d5.461). Mean relative edema
volumes were 2.24¡3.72 and 6.19¡8.04% for CSF and PEDF (n55 per group)
respectively. There was no significant difference between the groups (independent
t test, t(8)52.997, p5.348, d5.631), either (Figure 2).

PEDF Treatment Does Not Affect Exploratory Locomotion and
Anxiety After Striatal Ischemic Injury
To investigate whether PEDF treatment has an effect on behavioral outcome after
striatal ischemic injury, we performed four different behavioral tests. First, we
evaluated exploratory locomotion and anxiety using Open Field test on day 7.
We measured total distance traveled as well as time spent in the open center of
the box. For both parameters, data were normally distributed (KolmogorovSmirnov test, Z5.510, p5.957 for total distance traveled, Z5.476, p5.977 for
time spent in open center) and variances were homogenous across groups (Levené
test, F(1,5)52.771, p5.157 for total distance traveled, F(1,8)53.992, p5.102 for
time spent in open center).
Mean total distances traveled were 52.4¡17.2 and 60.6¡9.1 m for CSF (n53)
and PEDF (n54), respectively. There was no significant difference between the
groups (independent t test, t(5)52.829, p5.445, d5.596). Mean time spent in
the open center was 108.3¡24.1 and 142.0¡46.3 s for CSF (n53) and PEDF
(n54), respectively. There was no significant difference between the groups
(independent t test, t(5)521.131, p5.309, d5.912), either (Figure 3A).
Three animals (two from CSF and one from PEDF group) were excluded from
this behavioral test being unable to perform the test due to the injury.

PEDF Treatment Does Not Affect Motor Function After Striatal
Ischemic Injury
To assess motor function, we performed Pole test on day 9. We recorded the time
the mouse took to turn completely head downwards (time-to-turn) and the total
time it took to descend (time down). For both parameters, data were normally
distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Z5.796, p5.550 for time-to-turn,
Z5.680, p5.745 for time down) and variances were homogenous across groups

(Levené test, F(1,8)5.051, p5.828 for time-to-turn, F(1,8)54.069, p5.078 for
time down).
Mean time-to-turn were 2.0¡.7 and 1.6¡.8 s for CSF and PEDF (n55 per
group), respectively. There was no significant difference between the groups
(independent t test, t(8)5.828 p5.416, d5.543). However, mean time down was
significantly decreased in the PEDF compared to CSF group (independent t test,
t(8)53.798, p5.005, d52.407) with mean time down of 7.3¡.4 and 5.8¡.8 s for
CSF and PEDF (n55 per group) respectively (Figure 3B).
Another test to investigate the influence of PEDF on motor function after
MCAO is Rotarod, which we performed on day 10 recording the latency to fall off
the accelerating rod. Data were normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,
Z5.680, p5.744) and variances were homogenous across groups (Levené test,
F(1,8)5.155, p5.704).
Mean latencies to fall off the rod were 209.1¡44.9 and 168.1¡49.8 s for CSF
and PEDF (n55 per group) respectively. There was no significant difference
between the groups (independent t test, t(8)51.365, p5.210, d5.863) (
Figure 3C).

Figure 3. PEDF Treatment Does Not Affect Behavioral Outcome After Striatal Ischemic Injury. (A) Exploratory locomotion and anxiety were evaluated
using Open Field test on day 7. Total distances traveled and time spent in the open center were not significantly different between CSF (n53) and PEDF
(n54). (B) Pole test was carried out on day 9 to assess motor function. While the time the mouse took to turn completely head downwards (time-to-turn) was
not significantly different across groups, the time to descend down (time down) significantly decreased in the PEDF compared to CSF group (independent t
test, t(8)53.798, p5.005, d52.407, n55 per group). (C) Rotarod was also used to investigate the influence of PEDF on motor function after MCAO. On day
9, mean latencies to fall off the rod were not significantly different across groups. (D–E) To investigate spatial learning and memory, Morris Water Maze
(MWM) was performed with training for seven days prior to probe trial on day 21. (D) During training, swim speed did not significantly differ between the
groups. Escape latencies to reach the platform and total distance traveled were not significantly different between the groups, but between day 1 and day 5
for both PEDF (repeated measures ANOVA, p5.007 for escape latencies and p5.010 for total distance traveled) and CSF (p5.003 for both), but only for
CSF between day 1 and 6 (p5.023 for escape latencies and p5.019 for total distance traveled) and day 2 and 6 (p5.038 for escape latencies and p5.040
for total distance traveled). (E) During probe trial, time in target quadrant and swim speed were not significantly different across groups (n54 per group). On
the right, representative recordings during probe trial for CSF and PEDF groups are shown. Data is represented as means ¡ SD.

PEDF Treatment Does Not Affect Spatial Learning and Memory
After Striatal Ischemic Injury
To investigate spatial learning and memory, we performed Morris Water Maze
(MWM). We performed training for MWM for seven days prior to probe trial on
day 21. During training, we measured the escape latency to reach the platform,
total distance traveled and swim speed. Swim speed was not significantly different
between the groups (data not shown).
For escape latency to reach the platform, the assumption of sphericity was met
(Mauchly test, x2(20)535.070, p5.054). Variances were homogenous across
groups (Levené test, F(1,6)5.449, p5.528 for day 1; F(1,6)55.891, p5.051 for day
2; F(1,6)51.895, p5.218 for day 3; F(1,6)53.373, p5.116 for day 4; F(1,6)5.276,
p5.618 for day 5; F(1,6)5.735, p5.424 for day 6; F(1,6)5.372, p5.564 for day 7).
Mean escape latencies were 61.1¡17.3 s on day 1, 49.5¡18.0 s on day 2,
40.1¡21.3 s on day 3, 19.8¡12.7 s on day 4, 13.1¡9.6 s on day 5, 10.9¡4.9 s on
day 6, and 15.3¡12.4 s on day 7 for CSF, and 51.0¡13.6 s on day 1, 23.9¡8.6 s
on day 2, 17.0¡7.4 s on day 3, 30.6¡40.0 s on day 4, 11.0¡7.5 s on day 5,
10.7¡8.5 s on day 6, and 14.2¡7.9 s on day 7 for PEDF (n54 per group). The
omnibus test revealed that there was a significant effect of time (repeated
measures ANOVA, F(6,36)59.157, p,.001, partial-g25.604), but not of groups
on mean escape latencies (repeated measures ANOVA, F(6,36)51.502, p5.205,

partial-g25.200). Bonferroni posthoc analyses revealed a significant difference
between day 1 and day 5 for both PEDF (p5.007) and CSF (p5.003), but only for
CSF between day 1 and 6 (p5.023) and day 2 and 6 (p5.038) (Figure 3D).
For total distance traveled, the assumption of sphericity was met (Mauchly test,
2
x (20)526.665, p5.272). Variances were homogenous across groups (Levené test,
F(1,6)52.372, p5.174 for day 1; F(1,6)51.793, p5.229 for day 2; F(1,6)51.640,
p5.248 for day 3; F(1,6)52.976, p5.135 for day 4; F(1,6)52.741, p5.149 for day
5; F(1,6)5.014, p5.911 for day 6; F(1,6)51.567, p5.257 for day 7).
Mean total distances traveled were 1391.1¡409.8 m on day 1,
1028.0¡312.5bm on day 2, 838.9¡401.7 m on day 3, 456.1¡283.8 m on day 4,
321.2¡221.6 m on day 5, 247.1¡127.7 m on day 6, and 382.8¡366.5 m on day
7 for CSF, and 1075.4¡197.9 m on day 1, 484.5¡226.1 m on day 2,
358.6¡200.0 m on day 3, 648.3¡824.7 m on day 4, 229.1¡124.0 m on day 5,
218.9¡142.8 m on day 6, and 306.9¡170.5 m on day 7 for PEDF (n54 per
group). The omnibus test revealed that there was a significant effect of time
(repeated measures ANOVA, F(6,36)59.478, p,.001, partial-g25.612), but not
of groups on mean escape latencies (repeated measures ANOVA, F(6,36)51.368,
p5.254, partial-g25.186). Bonferroni posthoc analyses revealed a significant
difference between day 1 and day 5 for both PEDF (p5.010) and CSF (p5.003),
but only for CSF between day 1 and 6 (p5.019) and day 2 and 6 (p5.040) (
Figure 3D).
During probe trial, we recorded time in target quadrant and swim speed. For
both parameters, data were normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,
Z5.480, p5.975 for time in target quadrant, Z51.011, p5.258 for swim speed)
and variances were homogenous across groups (Levené test, F(1,6)5.188, p5.680
for time in target quadrant, F(1,6)55.295, p5.061 for swim speed).
Mean times in target quadrant were 32.8¡10.2 and 39.0¡14.5 s for CSF and
PEDF (n54 per group), respectively. There was no significant difference between
the groups (independent t test, t(6)52.705, p5.507, d5.499, Figure 3E). Mean
swim speed was 22.3¡4.2 and 20.7¡.92 cm/s for CSF and PEDF (n54 per
group), respectively. There was no significant difference between the groups
(independent t test, t(6)5.759, p5.476, d5.537), either. Representative recordings during probe trial for CSF and PEDF groups are shown in Figure 3E.
Two animals (one of each group) were excluded from this test because they
were not able to learn the task during the seven days of training.

For all regions of interest, the assumption of equality of covariance matrices was
met (Box’s M test, M51.019, M51.280, F5.291, p5.832 for striatum; F5.231,
p5.875 for cortex; M53.620, F5.822, p5.482 for SVZ; and M51.812, F5.412,
p5.745 for dentate gyrus). The assumption of sphericity was met because there
are only two measurement points per group (region of interest on the ipsilateral
and contralateral hemisphere).
For all regions of interest and measurement points, variances were homogenous
across groups (Levené test, F(1,7)5.931, p5.367 for ipsilateral striatum;
F(1,7)53.561, p5.101 for contralateral striatum; F(1,7)5.344, p5.576 for
ipsilateral cortex; F(1,7)5.173, p5.690 for contralateral cortex; F(1,7)5.051,
p5.827 for ipsilateral SVZ; F(1,7)5.349, p5.573 for contralateral SVZ;
F(1,7)5.725, p5.423 for ipsilateral dentate gyrus; F(1,7)5.341, p5.577 for
contralateral dentate gyrus).
Mean number of BrdU-positive cells/mm2 was 46.9¡28.7 on contralateral and
585.1¡101.9 on ipsilateral striatum for CSF, 74.8¡44.8 on contralateral and
612.8¡156.1 on ipsilateral striatum for PEDF, 44.4¡54.7 on contralateral and
163.4¡130.4 on ipsilateral cortex for CSF, 35.6¡37.7 on contralateral and
324.2¡120.6 on ipsilateral cortex for PEDF, 356.6¡100.9 on contralateral and
355.4¡160.4 on ipsilateral SVZ for CSF, 228.3¡92.6 on contralateral and
301.4¡212.9 on ipsilateral SVZ for PEDF, and 131.7¡61.1 on contralateral and
201.2¡83.3 on ipsilateral dentate gyrus for CSF, 162.7¡96.3 on contralateral and
183.1¡89.9 on ipsilateral dentate gyrus for PEDF (n55 for CSF, n54 for PEDF).
For cortex and striatum, the omnibus test revealed that there was a significant
effect of hemispheres (repeated measures ANOVA, F(1,7)515.970, p5.005,
partial-g25.695 for cortex; F(1,7)5171.194, p,.001, partial-g25.961 for
striatum), but not of groups on the number of BrdU-positive cells (repeated
measures ANOVA, F(1,7)52.767, p5.140, partial-g25.283 for cortex;
F(1,7),.001, p5.997, partial-g2,.001 for striatum). Bonferroni posthoc analyses
revealed a significant difference between ipsilateral and contralateral striatum for
both PEDF (F(1,7)576.994, p,0.001) and CSF (F(1,7)596.351, p,0.001).
However, for cortex, Bonferroni posthoc analyses revealed that there is a
significant difference between ipsilateral and contralateral cortex for PEDF
(F(1,7)514.415, p50.007), but not for CSF (F(1,7)53.016, p5.124) (Figure 4B).
For SVZ and dentate gyrus, the omnibus test revealed that there is neither a
significant difference between hemispheres (repeated measures ANOVA,
F(1,7)5.461, p5.519, partial-g25.062 for SVZ; F(1,7)52.940, p5.130, partialg25.296 for dentate gyrus) nor between groups on the number of BrdU-positive
cells (repeated measures ANOVA, F(1,7)5.493, p5.505, partial-g25.066 for SVZ;
F(1,7)5.875, p5.381, partial-g25.111 for dentate gyrus) (Figure 4C).
Even though we did not identify any change in overall cell proliferation between
the groups, a difference in cell type of proliferating cells was still possible.
Therefore, we performed double staining with cell-type specific markers. We did
not find any colocalization with NeuN. BrdU-positive cells were positive for
GFAP or Iba1.

For both GFAP and Iba1 double staining with BrdU, data were normally
distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Z5.496, p5.967 for GFAP, Z5.416,
p5.995 for Iba1) and variances were homogenous across groups (Levené test,
F(1,7)5.111, p5.749 for GFAP, F(1,5)51.469, p5.280 for Iba1). Mean number of
GFAP+/BrdU+ cells was 22.7¡6.7 and 23.5¡10.1 cells/mm2 for CSF (n55) and
PEDF (n54), respectively. There was no significant difference between CSF- and

PEDF Effects on Striatal Cerebral Ischemia

PEDF Treatment Does Not Affect Cell Death After Striatal Ischemic
Injury
We performed TUNEL to assess whether PEDF influences cell death after MCAO.
We corrected the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the ipsilateral striatum by
subtracting the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the contralateral striatum.
Data were normally distributed (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Z5.474, p5.978)
and variances were homogenous across groups (Levené test, F(1,7)5.075,
p5.792). Mean number of TUNEL-positive cells were 1096¡645 and 1238¡588
cells/mm2 for CSF (n55) and PEDF (n54), respectively. There was no significant
difference between the groups (independent t test, t(7)52.340, p5.744, d5.230)
(Figure 5).

Discussion
The objective of this study was to investigate whether PEDF can ameliorate
behavioral outcome as well as cell death and influences cell proliferation upon
focal cerebral ischemia. We demonstrate here that in an ischemic lesion confined
to the striatum, PEDF does not exert its previously described protective effects,
and has no effect on lesion size, behavioral outcome, cell proliferation, or cell
death.
In the present study, we implanted PEDF or CSF osmotic pumps into mice that
underwent MCAO two days later and received BrdU injections for 7 days starting
at the day of the MCAO. In contrast to a previous study showing that PEDF gene
transfer reduces lesion volumes and edema in a model of transient MCAO [8],
both were not altered in our study as determined using MRI at 24 hours after
reperfusion. However, lesion volumes and percentage of edema were smaller in
our model. This might be the reason why PEDF did not exert its protective effects
including lesion size reduction, improvement of behavioral outcome as well as
reduction of cell proliferation and cell death. Even if PEDF had an effect in this
model, the effect might have been too small to be detectable for the methods used
in this study.
Another explanation might be that the route, duration, and amount of PEDF
administration were not suitable for PEDF to be neuroprotective. In a previous
study by Sanagi and co-workers, PEDF overexpression led to protection after
MCAO. The authors injected an adenoviral vector containing the PEDF gene
directly into the target site [8]. Striatal injection might be superior to
intraventricular injections as molecules injected into the cerebrospinal fluid
rapidly move into the blood via bulk flow and penetrate brain tissue only poorly
[30]. Thus, striatal injection offers the benefit that large molecules such as PEDF
do not have to overcome the blood-CSF barrier at the choroid plexus or the
blood-brain barrier (BBB).
Interestingly, Pillai and co-workers showed that intravenously injected PEDF
overcomes the BBB. They demonstrated a reduction in lesion size along with
reduced BBB permeability between 24 hours and 1 week after reperfusion in a rat

model of transient focal cerebral ischemia [31]. In addition, Jinnouchi and
coworkers have previously shown that PEDF inhibits cold injury-induced brain
edema in mice through blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-induced
hyperpermeability [32]. Until now, the mechanism of action of PEDF on the BBB
after cerebral ischemia remains unclear. We here speculate that we did not
sufficiently evoke edema in our model of cerebral ischemia. This might explain
why PEDF does not seem to have an effect on behavioral outcome and cell death
in this model.
In our study, we decided to use infusion via osmotic pumps because we wanted
to directly influence the neurogenic zone. Osmotic pump infusion was previously
used successfully for delivery of various trophic factors: Among others, brainderived neurotrophic factor was applied intraventricularly in a mouse model of
Huntington’s disease [33] and to the cochlea of deafened guinea pigs [34]. In
those studies, neurotrophic factor administration was however performed for a
longer period and continued until the termination of the experiment.
We here infused PEDF for only 7 days and ended two weeks prior to final
euthanasia. This infusion regime was based on a previous study where Winner
and coworkers employed growth factor infusion in a model of PD in rats. They
infused epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 for seven
consecutive days starting at 8 days after induction of the lesion. The experiment
ended either right after the end of growth factor infusion or four weeks later.
Using this experimental design, the authors were able to demonstrate that growth

factor infusion enhances dopaminergic neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb, but not
in the striatum [35].
We chose a pre-MCAO treatment, although not directly applicable to patients,
because we wanted to investigate whether PEDF infusion would have an effect at
all for stroke recovery. We were not able to perform implantation of the pumps
right after MCAO because in a previous experiment, this led to an extremely high
mortality.
Another limitation of our study was the use of a single dosage. We want to
remark here that it would be beneficial to test different dosages for this
experimental design and that we can only report negative findings for this specific
dose. However, we here used a dose, which was successful for us in previous
experiments (effect on neurogenesis, not published, in preparation). In those
previous experiments, we indeed tested three dosages. We decided for the present
experimental design to use only the dose that clearly and fully was successful. For
this setup, we might have needed a higher concentration for PEDF to be
neuroprotective.
To our knowledge, we were the first to investigate the effect of PEDF on
behavioral outcome as well as cell proliferation after MCAO. On both, PEDF did
not show any effects compared to CSF infusion. We did not use any sham controls
to compare whether the behavioral deficits seen in the control group differed from
baseline. However, from our previous experience for at least Rotarod and Pole
test, we know that the changes we induced were greater than in sham animals
[21].
Regarding cell proliferation, intraventricular PEDF compared with vehicle
(saline) infusion was previously demonstrated to increase the number of BrdUpositive cells in the SVZ on both hemispheres in healthy animals [17]. In our
study, we started PEDF infusion two days prior to MCAO and BrdU injection.
Therefore, we might not see the initial increase in BrdU-positive cells. We chose
this treatment paradigm because were interested in the effect of PEDF on cell
proliferation after MCAO irrespective of its effect on the healthy brain. Here, the
number of BrdU-positive cells significantly increased in the ipsilateral compared
to contralateral striatum. It was previously shown that cortical injury leads to an
increase in cell proliferation in the SVZ. However, whether increased proliferation
after brain injury also leads to increased neurogenesis and whether neuronal
progenitor cells migrate to the site of injury is not entirely understood until now
(for review see Saha et al [36]).
The effect of PEDF on cell death was previously described in models of retinal
and in brain ischemia-reperfusion injury. Takita and colleagues demonstrated that
PEDF reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells after intraocular gene transfer
[37]. Li and coworkers reported that cell death ameliorated when PEDF was
delivered in polylactide-co-glycolide nanospheres [38]. In our study, PEDF did
not protect against cell death compared with CSF infusion.
Under our experimental conditions, PEDF does not seem to have an effect in
ischemic injury confined to striatal damage only. However, we cannot exclude
that PEDF might work under different conditions in stroke. Further studies need

to elucidate the effect of PEDF treatment on cell proliferation, cell death and
behavioral outcome in moderate to severe ischemic injury in the brain.
