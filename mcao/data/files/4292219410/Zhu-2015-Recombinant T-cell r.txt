Experimental stroke induces rapid activation of the
peripheral immune system, which contributes to the
brain’s inﬂammatory response to stroke (Nilupul Perera
et al., 2006; Dirnagl et al., 2007; Gee et al., 2007; Muir
et al., 2007). The migration of monocytes, neutrophils
and T cells into the brain with the breakdown of the
blood–brain barrier contributes to the further activation
of resident microglial cells and the expansion of brain tissue infarction. Among these cells, T cells are found in the
brain within hours after experimental stroke, which may
play a signiﬁcant role in exacerbating ischemic injury. Tand B-cell-deﬁcient mice sustain smaller lesion size and
reduced inﬂammation after experimental stroke (Hurn
et al., 2007), with CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes playing
a particularly important role in the inﬂammatory and
thrombogenic response associated with experimental
stroke by promoting an autoaggressive response to brain
antigens (Yilmaz et al., 2006). It is believed that myelinreactive antigens leak out of the brain with the breakdown
of the blood–brain barrier, which is recognized by the
immune system as a foreign antigen, leading to the
recruitment of T cells into the brain. These conclusions
are supported by the ﬁndings of increased inﬂux of myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-speciﬁc T cells into
the brain and of reduced infarct size after stroke by nasal
vaccination with a MOG peptide (Frenkel et al., 2003).
Recombinant T cell ligands (RTLs) are a class of
partial major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II
molecules comprised of covalently linked a1 and b1
chains that are tethered to a MOG peptide (Burrows
et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2003; Vandenbark et al.,
2003). We have previously demonstrated that RTL551,
a mouse MHC moiety (I-Ab) coupled to mouse myelin
peptide (mMOG-35-55), reduces infarct size in 3-monthold young adult C57BL/6 mice (Subramanian et al.,
2009; Dziennis et al., 2011). The action mechanism
involves in selective modulation of auto-aggressive
CD4+ T cells by delivering partial agonist signals through
the T cell receptor (TCR), and further inhibition of the
accumulation of other inﬂammatory cells, particularly
macrophages/activated microglial cells and dendritic

Abstract—We have previously demonstrated that recombinant T-cell receptor ligand 1000 (RTL1000) reduces infarct
size and improves long-term functional recovery after experimental stroke in young transgenic mice expressing human
leukocyte antigen DR2 (DR2-Tg). In this study, we determined the eﬀect of RTL1000 on infarct size in 12month-old middle-aged DR2-Tg mice, and investigated its
mechanism of action. Twelve-month-old male DR2-Tg mice
underwent 60 min of intraluminal reversible middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO). Vehicle or RTL1000 was injected 4,
24, 48 and 72 h after MCAO. Cortical, striatal and total hemispheric infarcts were measured 96 h after stroke. Spleen and
brain tissues were collected 96 h after stroke for immunological analysis. Our data showed that RTL1000 signiﬁcantly
reduced infarct size 96 h after MCAO in middle-aged male
DR2-Tg mice. RTL1000 decreased the number of activated
monocytes/microglia cells (CD11b+CD45hi) and CD3+ T
cells in the ischemic hemisphere. RTL1000 also reduced
the percentage of total T cells and inﬂammatory neutrophils
in the spleen. These ﬁndings suggest that RTL1000 protects
against ischemic stroke in middle-aged male mice by limiting post-ischemic inﬂammation. Ó 2014 IBRO. Published

cells, a kind of antigen presenting cells that assist with
activation of T cells in the brain.
We have previously found that RTL treatment is
antigen-speciﬁc and MHC-speciﬁc. Our data show that
RTL553, which has the same MHC moiety as RTL551
but is linked to a non-neuroantigen peptide (I-Ea-52-68),
had no eﬀect on infarct size in C57BL/6 mice. Similarly,
RTL treatment with RTL342M, which has the same
mMOG-35-55 peptide as RTL551 but a diﬀerent MHC II
moiety (HLA-DR2), failed to reduce infarct size
(Dziennis et al., 2011). These ﬁndings indicate that
RTL551 may not work in patients with stroke considering
species-diﬀerences (murine vs. human) in antigens and
MHC II molecules. To determine if a RTL strategy would
work against human stroke, we determined the eﬃcacy
of humanized recombinant T-cell receptor ligand 1000
(RTL1000), which contains a human MHC moiety (HLADR2) covalently linked to a human myelin peptide
(hMOG-35-55) in experimental stroke in humanized
DR2-Tg
mice
which
expresses
human
TCR
(Subramanian et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2014a). We found
that RTL1000 indeed protects against ischemic injury in
young male DR2-Tg mice. Behavioral testing showed that
RTL1000 improves long-term cognitive function 28 days
after stroke (Zhu et al., 2014a). A similar eﬀect has also
been demonstrated in young female DR2-Tg mice (Pan
et al., 2014). We also conﬁrmed that combining
RTL1000 with t-PA does not alter its ability to reduce
infarct in experimental ischemic stroke (Zhu et al., 2014b).
It’s well known that ischemic stroke risk increases with
age, and stroke is most common in the aging population.
Unfortunately, most animal studies, including our own
previous study using RTL1000 were conducted in
healthy young mice. The Stroke Therapy Academic
Industry Roundtable (STAIR) has identiﬁed age as an
important factor to be considered in developing
therapeutic agents for the treatment of stroke (Stroke
therapy academic industry roundtable, 1999). In order to
meet the preclinical STAIR criteria (Stroke therapy
academic industry roundtable, 1999; Fisher et al.,
2009), and to move our research ﬁndings closer to clinical
practice, in the present study, we evaluated the eﬃcacy of
RTL1000 in protecting against ischemic in middle-aged
(12-month-old) humanized DR2-Tg mice. Furthermore,
successful preclinical evaluation requires target validation
to ensure outcomes are indeed linked to the purported
mechanism of action of the compound (Feuerstein
et al., 2008). Therefore, in the current study, we additionally validated that RTL1000 indeed reduces post-ischemic
inﬂammation by limiting the inﬁltration of inﬂammatory
cells into the brain in middle-aged mice.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics statement
Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with
National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of
experimental animals. The protocols were approved by
the Animal Care and Use Committee at the Oregon
Health & Science University and the Portland Veteran

113

Aﬀairs Medical Center. All eﬀorts were made to
minimize the number of animals used and their suﬀering.
Animals and experimental groups
Studies were performed on male HLA-DRB1*1502
transgenic (DR2-Tg) mice (produced at the Portland VA
Medical Center with foundation breeders provided by Dr.
Chella David (Gonzalez-Gay et al., 1996)) aged
12 months (ranging from 52 to 54 weeks) and weighing
25.6–39.5 g (a total of n = 47). Thirty-three mice were
used for infarct size analysis (16 in the RTL1000 group
and 17 in the vehicle group) and splenocyte number
counting and survival assay. Separate groups of seven
mice per group were used for the analysis of cell populations in the brain and spleen assay by ﬂow cytometry.
Mice were randomly assigned to either RTL1000 or vehicle groups, and investigators were blinded to treatment
groups during surgery and tissue analysis.
RTL 1000 production and puriﬁcation
RTL molecules consist of the a1 and b1 domains of the
MHC II molecule expressed as a single polypeptide with
or without antigenic amino terminal extensions
(Burrows et al., 1999; Huan et al., 2005). RTL1000 is a
HLA-DRB1*1502 (DR2) molecule linked to human
MOG 35–55 peptide (MEVGWYRPPFSRVVHLYRNGK)
(Subramanian et al., 2009). RTL1000 was constructed
de novo or by sequential site-directed mutagenesis of previous constructs. Protein puriﬁcation was performed with
a 30- to 40-mg yield of puriﬁed protein per liter of bacterial
cell culture.
RTL1000 treatment
Mice were randomized to injections of 100 lL of either
RTL1000 (1 lg/lL) or vehicle (5% dextrose in Tris–HCl,
pH 8.5) 4 h after stroke by subcutaneous (S.C.)
injection, which was followed by 3 injections of the same
volume and concentration at 24, 48, and 72 h after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The dose and
injection protocol of RTL1000 was established in our
previous studies (Subramanian et al., 2009; Zhu et al.,
2014a,b).
Reversible MCAO
Reversible MCAO was induced via the intraluminal
ﬁlament technique as described previously with slight
modiﬁcations (Zhu et al., 2010). Mice were anesthetized
with isoﬂurane (5% induction; 1.2% maintenance) using
a mask connected with a vaporizer (Isotec 4; Cyprane,
England) throughout surgery and during a 60-min vascular occlusion until ﬁlament withdrawal and initiation of
reperfusion. Rectal temperature was monitored and maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C throughout surgery with a warm
water pad and a heating lamp. Cortical blood ﬂow (CBF)
was monitored by laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF; Model
DRT4, Moor Instruments Ltd., Oxford, England). The right
lateral common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed and
temporarily ligated. The right external carotid artery
(ECA) was ligated and cauterized. Ipsilateral MCAO

was accomplished by inserting a 6-0 nylon monoﬁlament
surgical suture (ETHICON, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA)
with a heat-rounded and silicone-coated (Xantopren comfort light, Heraeus, Germany) tip into the internal carotid
artery (ICA) via the ECA stump till the tip of ﬁlament
reached the beginning of middle cerebral artery (MCA).
The successful occlusion of MCA was conﬁrmed by an
abrupt drop, followed by sustained CBF of less than
30% of the baseline. The ﬁlament was withdrawn and
the CCA was released to allow for reperfusion at 60-min
occlusion. The mice were then allowed to recover from
anesthesia and survived for 96 h following the onset of
ischemia. Animals were excluded if CBF failed to drop
below 30% of the baseline during MCAO or due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
Determination of infarct volume
Animals were euthanized and brains were harvested 96 h
after MCAO. Infarct volumes were measured after
staining brain slices with 1.2% solution of 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO,
USA). Four slices of 2-mm-thick coronal sections were
incubated in 1.2% TTC for 15 min at 37 °C, and then
ﬁxed in 10% buﬀered formalin phosphate overnight. Both
sides of each stained slice were photographed and
evaluated by SigmaScan Pro 5.0 (Jandel, San G, Rarael,
CA, USA). Infarct volume was expressed as a
percentage of contralateral structure (cortex, striatum,
and hemisphere). To account for the eﬀect of edema,
infarct volume was calculated by subtracting the
ipsilateral non-infarct region from the total contralateral
structure volume, and dividing the diﬀerence by the
contralateral volume (Zhang et al., 2013).

Leukocyte isolation from the brain and the spleen
Spleens from individual MCAO-treated mice were
removed and a single-cell suspension was prepared by
passing the tissue through a 100-lm nylon mesh (BD
Falcon, Bedford, MA, USA). The cells were washed
using RPMI 1640 and the red cells lysed using 1 red
cell lysis buﬀer (eBioscience, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA)
and incubated for 1 min. The cells were then washed with
RPMI 1640 and counted. The brain was divided into the
ischemic (right) and non-ischemic (left) hemispheres,
digested for 60 min with 1 mg/mL Type IV collagenase
(Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and DNase I
(50 mg/ml, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) in
RPMI 1640 at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Samples
were mixed with a 1 mL pipette every 15 min. The
suspension was washed once in RPMI 1640,
resuspended in 80% Percoll overlayed with 40% Percoll
and centrifuged for 30 min at 1600 rpm. The cells were
then washed with RPMI 1640, counted, and resuspended
in staining medium.
Analysis of cell populations by ﬂow cytometry
All antibodies were purchased from commercial vendors
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA or eBioscience, Inc.,
San Diego, CA, USA) as published (Schmid et al.,
1992). Four-color (FITC, PE, PECy-5 and APC) ﬂuorescence ﬂow cytometry analyses were performed to determine the phenotypes of splenocytes and brain cells.
1  106 splenocytes or 2  105 brain cells were washed
with staining medium (PBS containing 0.1% NaN3 and
1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Illinois)) and incubated
with combinations of the following monoclonal antibodies:
CD11b (M1/70), CD45 (30-F11), CD11c (HL3), CD19
(1D3), CD3 (145-2C11), CD8 (53-6.7), CD4 (RM4-5),
GR-1 (RB6-8C5), Ly6C (AL-21), CD44 (IM7), CCR5
(HM-CCR5), CD25 (7D4) and CD122 (TM-b1) for
20 min at 4 °C. CD11b is an integrin present on myeloid
cells and microglia. CD45 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase expressed on all hematopoietic cells except mature
erythrocytes and platelets. A high expression of CD45

Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Diﬀerences in
cortical, striatal and total hemispheric infarct sizes
between vehicle and RTL1000 groups were determined
by a 2-way ANOVA with Holm–Sidak analysis. Spleen
and brain cell counts and percentages of cellular
subtypes for FACS analyses were analyzed by Student’s
t-test. Comparison of mortality was performed by Chisquared test. Statistical analysis of infarct size and
mortality was performed using SigmaStat3 statistical
software (Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and
the data of cell counts and cellular subtypes was analyzed
by GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA,
USA). Statistical signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05.

RESULTS
Animal characteristics, mortality and exclusions
There were no diﬀerences in age or baseline body weight
between vehicle and RTL1000-treated animals (Table 1).
No diﬀerences in mortality were found between groups
which was 36.4% (eight in 22) in the vehicle group
(Data not shown), compared to 27.3% (six in 22) in the
RTL1000 group (P = 0.746). Two mice died at 48 h,
four at 72 h and two at 96 h after stroke in the vehicle
group. In the RTL1000 group, two mice died at 48 h,
three at 72 h and one at 96 h after MCAO. No animals
died within the ﬁrst 24 h. According to autopsy, all
deaths were attributed to massive infarction. Two
animals in the vehicle group were excluded because
CBF was greater than 30% of the baseline during
MCAO and the other one mouse in RTL1000 group was
excluded due to SAH.
RTL1000 reduced infarct size in middle-aged male
DR2-Tg mice after experimental ischemic stroke
We tested the eﬀect of RTL1000 on infarct size 96 h after
MCAO. As shown in Fig. 1A, B, male DR2-Tg mice
treated with RTL1000 had smaller infarcts compared to
vehicle-treated mice. Quantitative analysis of TTCstained brain slices 96 h after ischemia showed that
RTL1000 signiﬁcantly reduced infarct size 96 h after
stroke which was 42.6% ± 2.3%, 73.5% ± 2.6% and
30.4% ± 1.3% respectively in the cortex, striatum and
total hemisphere in vehicle-treated mice compared to

We reported previously that RTL551 reduced
inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration into the brain after MCAO in
young C57BL/6 mice. In this study, we found that
RTL1000 has a similar eﬀect on experimental stroke in
middle-aged DR2-Tg mice.
RTL1000 signiﬁcantly reduced CD11b+CD45+ cells,
which represent macrophages and activated microglia
cells in the ischemic hemisphere of the brain (Fig. 2A:
54.5% in vehicle-treated mice versus 20.3% in RTL1000treated mice). The absolute numbers of activated
monocytes/microglia cells were 30,838 ± 9887 in
vehicle-treated mice versus 5487 ± 768 in RTL1000treated mice (Fig. 2B and Table 2: p < 0.05). RTL1000
caused a reduction in absolute number of CD3+ T cells
in the ischemic hemisphere. Unexpectedly, we also
observed a decrease in CD3+ T cells in the non-ischemic
hemisphere, which may be related to the speciﬁcity of
RTL treatment to target T cells and cause a global
decrease in that cell type (Fig. 2B and Table 2:
p < 0.01). There were no diﬀerences in absolute
numbers of B cells and dendritic cells between vehicle
and RTL1000 groups in ischemic hemisphere.
RTL1000 treatment altered peripheral immune
subtypes in middle-aged mice 96 h after MCAO
Out data showed a trend of increased total splenocyte
numbers and decreased cell death in RTL1000-treated
mice, although the diﬀerences were not statistical
signiﬁcant (Fig. 3 and Table 3). Corresponding with the
reduction of inﬂammatory cells in the brain, RTL1000
signiﬁcantly reduced the percentage of CD3+
(p < 0.01), CD4+ (p < 0.05), CD8+ (p < 0.05) T cells
and neutrophils in the spleen (Fig. 4), while no
diﬀerences were found in the frequency of CD19+B
cells, CD11C+ dendritic cells and monocytes/
macrophages in the spleen between vehicle and
RTL1000-treated mice. Further study indicated that
RTL1000 decreased the frequency of CD8+CD122+
regulatory-like T cells (Table 4; p < 0.05). There were

DISCUSSION
We have previously demonstrated that RTL1000 reduced
infarct size and improved long-term functional recovery in
young DR2-Tg mice. In the present study, we determined
the eﬀect of RTL1000 on ischemic stroke in middle-aged
DR2-Tg mice and we investigated its mechanism of
action. We found that RTL1000 is similarly eﬀective in

inﬂammatory cells into the brain in middle-aged mice.
RTL treatment was originally designed as a therapy
for multiple sclerosis, an inﬂammatory demyelinating
disease mediated by CD4+ T cells, which is followed by
secondary inﬁltration of primarily macrophages in the
central nervous system (CNS) (Burrows et al., 1999,

2000, 2001). RTLs reverse clinical and histological symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by
reducing secondary inﬁltration of immune cells including
macrophages as well as the expression of chemokines
and chemokine receptors required for entry into the
CNS (Sinha et al., 2007; Dziennis et al., 2011). Since
ischemic stroke induces activation of the peripheral
immune system and recruitment of inﬂammatory cells into
the brain, including neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, which contribute to ischemic brain injury (del
Zoppo et al., 2001; Emsley et al., 2001; Gelderblom
et al., 2009), we tested if RTLs could be used as a therapeutic agent in stroke. We found that RTL551 indeed
reduced infarct size 96 h after MCAO (Subramanian
et al., 2009; Dziennis et al., 2011). Considering species
diﬀerences, we then tested the eﬀect of another RTL construct, RTL1000, which contains a human MHC covalently linked to a human myelin peptide, in humanized
DR2 transgenic mice which express human TCR. Similar
to RTL551 treatment in wild-type mice, RTL1000 also
reduced infarct size in young DR2-Tg mice 96 h after
MCAO (Subramanian et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2014a).

However, it is uncertain if beneﬁt in young, healthy
animals can be extrapolated to ischemic stroke in
humans which occurs mainly in middle-aged and aged
people (Fisher et al., 2009). Therefore, in this project,
we examined the eﬀect of RTL1000 in middle-aged mice.
In agreement with our results in young mice, RTL1000
reduced infarct size 96 h after the stroke when it was
administrated 4 h after occlusion. At the same time,
RTL1000 decreased the number of activated monocytes/microglia cells and the absolute number of T cells
in the ischemia hemisphere of the brain. This is similar
to the eﬀect of RTL551 in blocking the inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells in young wild-type mice (Dziennis et al.,
2011). We also observed a slightly increased total number
of splenocytes, yet decreased CD3, CD4, CD8 and neutrophils in the spleen. We speculate that the mechanism
by which RTL1000 reduced the frequency of T cells and
neutrophils in the spleen was through inhibition of immune
cell activation and expansion while also decreasing,
although not signiﬁcantly, splenic eﬄux to the periphery.
The molecular mechanism of action for RTL involves
the modulation of T cell functional properties and
blockade of immune cells ﬁltrating into the brain. MOG,
a myelin antigen, leaks out of the brain with the
breakdown of the blood–brain barrier after stroke
(Dirnagl et al., 2007). MOG-speciﬁc CD 4+ T cells
migrate into the brain, being activated by MHC II molecule, mistaking brain antigens for foreign pathogens and
attacking them. T cells also produce cytokine, which initiate an inﬂammatory cascade involving recruitment of
other inﬂammatory cells, including neutrophils, macrophages and other lymphocytes (Jin et al., 2010).
RTL1000 is a partial MHC II molecule tethered to a
MOG peptide which targets myelin-speciﬁc T cells and
profoundly changes their functional properties from proinﬂammation to anti-inﬂammation. Meanwhile, instead of
recruitment of inﬂammatory cells, T cells modulated by
RTL1000 could inhibit entry of other T cells and activated
macrophages into the brain (Wang et al., 2003; Sinha
et al., 2007), demonstrated in our present data. On the
other hand, although we did not ﬁnd any changes in activation and migration markers on T cells in the spleen, we
did observe a signiﬁcant decrease in CD8+CD122+ regulatory T cells. We speculate that the regulatory population migrated out of the spleen to the periphery and
possibly the brain to reduce tissue speciﬁc inﬂammation
and immune cell-based neurodegeneration.

CONCLUSION
In summary, we demonstrated that RTL1000 protects
against acute ischemic stroke in middle-aged mice. The
mechanisms involve the modulation of RTL1000 on T
cell functional properties and blockade of inﬁltration of
inﬂammatory cells into the brain. Our results will move
this new stroke therapy closer to clinical trials.
