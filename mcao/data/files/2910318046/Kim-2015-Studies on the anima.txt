a b s t r a c t
We investigated the question of whether an animal model of post-stroke depression in ischemic stroke
can be developed by additional chronic mild stress (CMS) procedures. Behavioral and histopathological
analysis was performed for examination of the depressive disorders in CMS, left middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) and CMS after MCAO (MCAO + CMS) in mice. In all depressant screening tests involving open ﬁeld, sucrose preference, forced swim and Morris water maze test, MCAO + CMS mice showed
more signiﬁcant depressive behaviors than MCAO mice. MCAO + CMS mice also showed distinct deﬁcits
in forced swim and Morris water maze test compared with CMS. In the histopathological analysis, prominent atrophic changes were seen in the striatum and midbrain of MCAO treated mice compared with CMS.
MCAO + CMS mice showed a decrease of proliferative and differentiated neuronal cells in the striatum and
hippocampus with dopaminergic neuronal injuries in the midbrain as compared with CMS and MCAO
alone treated mice. Treatment of MCAO + CMS mice with aripiprazole resulted in reduction of all depressive behaviors examined, particularly in the Morris water maze test. Recovered dopaminergic neuronal
injuries in the midbrain and enhanced neurogenesis in the hippocampus were also demonstrated. Our
results suggest that CMS after ischemic stroke can lead to severe depressive-like behavior compared with
CMS or MCAO alone treated mice via neurodegeneration in the primary lesion and secondary extrafocal
sites and degradation of neurogenesis, and these behavioral and histopathological changes are reversed
by treatment with aripiprazole. Thus adjunct therapy with an antipsychotic may exert its antidepressant
effects via neuroprotection and neurogenesis in CMS-treated ischemic mice.

1. Introduction
Depression, a debilitating mental disorder characterized by negative mood, diminished interest or pleasure in activities, etc., is very

common after stroke events [1]. More than one-third of stroke survivors suffer from common mood symptoms including anxiety and
feelings of despair as well as anhedonia [1,2]. Vascular depression
is poorly deﬁned, but its hypothesis proposed that cerebrovascular diseases are associated with increased risk for some depressive
syndromes. Ischemic depression is considered a subtype of vascular
depression [3].
Underlying mechanisms of post-stroke depression are associated in part with neuronal loss and impaired neurogenesis in

Y.R. Kim et al. / Behavioural Brain Research 287 (2015) 294–303

the ischemic lesion and secondary degenerative changes [2,4].
Although there are a number of established risk factors for development of depression after brain ischemia, including physical
disability and cognitive impairment, personal circumstances also
have a major impact on mental health [1,5]. Social stress such as
isolation after stroke is recognized as a major risk factor in both
histological and behavioral analysis that can potentially improve
post-stroke depression [6–8].
Previous studies have investigated the inﬂuence of chronic mild
stress (CMS) after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on
depressive-like behavior in animal models. Chronic mild stressors
after stroke induce a broad spectrum of core depressive-like symptoms that seem to be regarded as synthetic effects of MCAO and CMS
[9,10]. Exposure to chronic stress after stroke can result in atrophy
or degeneration in brain regions including inhibition of neurogenesis [11–14]. Stroke entails neurodegeneration in the lesion site and
penumbra as well as in remote brain areas that contribute to mood
symptoms [4]. Thus CMS may strongly inﬂuence stroke damage
and recovery, however, the mechanisms involved in its effects on
expression of post-stroke depression remain unknown.
Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug, is approved as an
adjunct therapy for major depressive disorder with a drug from
the group of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and
its adjunctive therapy could be effective for complex post-stroke
emotional disorders with a beneﬁcial effect on cognitive function
[15,16]. Antidepressants, particularly SSRIs, exert beneﬁcial effects
on brain structure extending far beyond mood effects [17,18]. In
addition, CMS may strongly enhance stroke damage contributing
to clinical symptoms of depression in the experimental model, and
aripiprazole treatment may have potential in treatment of poststroke depression as an add-on therapy via neuroprotection and
neurogenesis against summative neuronal injury by CMS [15].
To validate these hypotheses, we ﬁrst compared their ability
to induce depressive-like behaviors in three experimental models,
CMS, MCAO, and MCAO + CMS, and then determined histopathological interaction of stroke and chronic mild stress on depressive
phenotypes. Next we investigated effects of antipsychotic aripiprazole on the behavioral and histopathological changes of the brain
in chronic mild stress-treated ischemic mice.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animal
Male C57BL/6 mice aged 10 weeks were obtained from Dooyeol
Biotech (Seoul, Korea). The mice were housed at 22 ◦ C under alternating 12 h cycles of dark and light, and were fed a commercial diet
and allowed tap water ad libitum throughout the study. All experiments were approved by the Pusan National University Animal Care
and Use Committee in accordance with the National Institutes of
Health Guidelines.
2.2. Chronic mild stress
The CMS procedure was applied from Willner et al. with slight
modiﬁcation [19]. The chronic mild stress regimen included a total
of 7 different stressors, which were arranged day and night in order
for 17 consecutive days as follows: food and water deprivation
(20 h), water deprivation (18 h), 45◦ cage tilt (17 h), overnight illumination (36 h), soiled cage (21 h), swimming in 4 ◦ C water (5 min),
and paired caging (2 h).
2.3. Focal cerebral ischemia
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by occluding the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) using the intraluminal ﬁlament technique. A

295

ﬁber-optic probe was afﬁxed to the skull over the middle cerebral
artery for measurement of regional cerebral blood ﬂow using a PeriFlux Laser Doppler System 5000 (Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden).
Left MCAO model was induced by a silicon-coated 4-0 monoﬁlament in the internal carotid artery and the monoﬁlament was
advanced to occlude the MCA. The ﬁlament was withdrawn 30 min
after occlusion and reperfusion was conﬁrmed using laser Doppler.
All groups were kept in adjacent cages in the same area and the
MCAO mice did not receive any stress and also had free access to
food and water. MCAO + CMS mice underwent the CMS procedure
from 2 days after MCAO.
2.4. Drug administration
Aripiprazole was administered orally into the mice from 2 days
after MCAO during the CMS process (successive 17 d) using a sonde.
Aripiprazole was dissolved at concentration of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg
body weight in distilled water.
2.5. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling
Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a synthetic thymidine analog,
becomes incorporated into a cell’s DNA when the cell is dividing
during the S-phase of the cell cycle. For labeling of proliferating
cells, all animals were injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg, i.p.) to successive 5 days after MCAO.
2.6. Behavioral experiments
The open ﬁeld, sucrose preference, and forced swim test were
performed from the 2nd week after MCAO to the 6th week once a
week. Morris water maze tests were performed during successive
4 days at 6th week after MCAO.
2.6.1. Open ﬁled test
The open-ﬁeld apparatus consisted of a black box
(30 cm × 30 cm × 40 cm). After 10 min of adaptation in a black
box, measurement was performed for 30 min as the total distance
traveled by placing the mice. Results of the experiment were
recorded using SMART 2.5.18 (Panlab S.L.U., Barcelona, Spain).
2.6.2. Sucrose preference test
Mice were deprived of food and water for 20 h after habituation
of 1% sucrose solution (AMRESCO Inc., Solon, OH, USA) for 24 h.
Subsequently, their preference for 1% sucrose solution and water
was measured for 1 h by weighing the whole bottle with solution
or water.
2.6.3. Forced swim test
One day before the test, mice were exposed in a glass cylinder (15 cm in height × 10 cm diameter) of 25 ◦ C water for 5 min. On
the test day, behavior was recorded using a digital camera (E8400,
Nicon Corporation, Japan) for 5 min and scored until immobile time
in a cylinder.
2.6.4. Morris water maze test
Mice trained on the Morris water maze for 4 days (5 trials per
day) before MCAO. The tank had a diameter of 100 cm, an altitude
of 50 cm. The platform was placed 0.5 cm beneath the surface of the
water. Each trial was performed for 90 s or until the mouse arrives
on the platform. Results of the experiment were recorded using
SMART 2.5.18 (Panlab, S.L.U.).

2.7. Histological assessment

2.11. Data analyses

Mice anesthetized with 8% chloral hydrate received intraperitoneal perfusion with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS. Brains were removed, post-ﬁxed in the same ﬁxative for
24 h at 4 ◦ C, and immersed in 30% sucrose solution for 72 h at
4 ◦ C for cryoprotection. For evaluation of brain damage or atrophy, frozen 30 ␮m-thick sections were stained in 0.1% cresyl violet
(Sigma–Aldrich Corporation, Saint Louis, MO, USA). For assessment
of myelin damage and axonal loss, sections were stained with luxol
fast blue (LFB, Solvent Blue 38, Sigma–Aldrich Corporation). Slides
were mounted in the mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.,
Burlingame, CA, USA). The contralateral and ipsilateral subarea
sizes of each section (striatum, corpus callosum, cortex, hippocampus and midbrain) were measured using i-solution (IMT i-Solution
Inc., Burnaby, BC, Canada).

All data are expressed as mean ± SEM and were analyzed using
the Sigmastat statistical program Version 11.2 (Systat Software,
San Jose, CA, USA). Data were analyzed statistically using oneway ANOVA via Tukey’s post hoc comparison when comparing
more than two groups. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

2.8. TUNEL assay
Apoptotic neuronal death was characterized by terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL). TUNEL assay was performed using a DeadEndTM Fluorometric TUNEL System kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA)
and TUNEL-positive cells were counted. Quantitative analysis was
performed blindly by counting the number of apoptotic cells using
a ﬂuorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Gottingen, Germany).
The data are presented number of total apoptotic cells.

2.9. Immunohistochemistry
The 30 ␮m-thick sections were incubated with a blocking buffer
(1× PBS/5% normal goat serum/0.3% Triton X-100) for 1 h. The
sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies
overnight in PBS at 4 ◦ C; 2,3-cyclic nucleotide-3-phosphodiesterase
(CNPase, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), 5-bromo-2 -deoxyuridine
(BrdU, AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK), ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka,
Japan), myelin basic protein (MBP, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), neuronal nuclei (NeuN, Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA), and
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, Millipore Corporation). After washes
with PBS, the sections were incubated with the secondary biotinylated antibody for 2 h and then washed with PBS. The sections
were incubated with ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h
and then stained with diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) for 2–10 min. For immunoﬂuorescent staining, without
blocking endogenous peroxidase, the sections were incubated with
ﬂuorescent secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and DAPI
(Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 2 h and 30 min in the
dark, respectively. Slides were mounted in the mounting medium
(Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and captured using an optical microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Gottingen, Germany).

2.10. Real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Total RNA was prepared from brain tissue treated with TRIZOL
reagentTM (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. cDNA was synthesized using 2 ␮g of total RNA
and oligodT(18) primer with taq polymerase (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) in a 25 ␮l total reaction volume. qPCR was
performed by incubating the mixture at 37 ◦ C for 45 min, and the
reaction was terminated at 95 ◦ C for 5 min. The following primers
for nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
(NF-␬B) p50 were used: 5 -AGGAAGAAAATGGCG-GAGTT-3 (forward) and 5 -GCATAAGCTTCTGGCGTTTC-3 (reverse).

3. Results
3.1. Behavioral analysis for depression
In performance of the depressive behavioral phenotypes such
as open ﬁeld test (anxiety-like behavior), sucrose preference test
(anhedonia), and forced swim test (despair-like behavior), all three
types of animal model developed despair-like behavior (Fig. 1).
Total distance moved for the general locomotor activity by open
ﬁeld test was lower than basal in all three types and the greatest distance was observed in MCAO mice. Compared with MCAO,
MCAO + CMS mice showed signiﬁcantly lower locomotor activity. Total sucrose intake by sucrose preference test did not differ
between CMS and MCAO + CMS, but MCAO + CMS showed a significant reduction in the consumption of sucrose solution compared
with MCAO. Although highest total time ﬂoating by forced swim
test was observed in MCAO from 3 to 5 weeks, all three types
showed signiﬁcantly reduced latency to ﬂoat, and MCAO + CMS
showed signiﬁcantly decreased total time ﬂoating compared with
CMS. Regarding spatial memory by Morris water maze test, MCAO
mice took a longer time on average to ﬁnd the platform than
CMS mice. MCAO + CMS mice attained a signiﬁcantly higher time
at both 4–6 weeks compared with MCAO mice. These results suggest that MCAO mice exposed to CMS generally developed more
severe changes in all depressive behaviors compared with MCAO
mice, and marked changes in forced swim and Morris water maze
test compared with CMS alone treated mice.
3.2. Histopathological analysis for the brain
After depressive behavioral test, we attempted to determine
whether regional atrophy in the whole brain could be observed
in a three type model. In the histological analyses of coronal
brain sections, atrophy volumes were expressed as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere. Prominent changes of MCAO
treated mice were seen in the striatum and midbrain of the
brain compared with CMS, and MCAO + CMS mice in the corpus
callosum. In particular, marked changes of MCAO + CMS mice were
detected in the striatum of the brain, which suggested the primary lesion site by ischemic assaults (Fig. 2). TUNEL and PI staining
of the striatum showed signiﬁcantly increased apoptotic features
in MCAO treated mice compared with CMS mice. Lower TUNEL
and TUNEL/PI-positive cells were detected in MCAO + CMS compared with MCAO, however, more numerous activated microglia
were observed in the MCAO + CMS. NF-␬B mRNA expression was
also increased in the ipsilateral striatum of MCAO treated mice
and in the contralateral one of MCAO + CMS compared with CMS
(Fig. 3).
In examination by LFB, MBP, and CNPase, slight demyelination
was observed on the ipsilateral side of the corpus callosum in MCAO
mice, however, no signiﬁcant change was observed among the
three types (Fig. 4). In the TH immunohistochemistry of the midbrain, unilateral loss of TH-positive bodies and ﬁbers was observed
in ipsilateral substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area of MCAO
treated mice and more severe loss of these changes was observed
in MCAO + CMS mice, however, there was no signiﬁcant change in

NeuN-positive cells in all three types of model (Fig. 5). These results
suggest that MCAO + CMS mice had pronounced severe atrophy of
the striatum and loss of dopaminergic neuronal cells of midbrain
on the ipsilateral side compared with MCAO alone treated mice.
Thus summative neurodegeneration by CMS in both striatum and
midbrain of MCAO treated mice may be involved in a developing
process of depression.

suggest that MCAO can increase the number of newly formed neuroblasts and enhance differentiation into neurons in the ipsilateral
striatum and hippocampus, but these cells are decreased by CMS
procedures.

3.3. Cell proliferation analysis in the striatum, hippocampus and
midbrain

Promoting neuroprotection and neurogenesis of the brain may
contribute to the antidepressant effects of aripiprazole, thus we
treated MCAO + CMS mice with this drug in order to validate this
hypothesis. In the monitoring of open ﬁeld, sucrose preference and
forced swim test, treatment with aripiprazole resulted in reduction
of all depressive behaviors examined, especially at high 30 mg/kg
dose. In addition, regarding spatial memory assessed by Morris water maze test, aripiprazole-treated MCAO + CMS mice took
a markedly shorter time on average to ﬁnd the platform than
vehicle at all three doses (Fig. 7). In TH immunohistochemical
analysis for midbrain, recovered TH-positive cells were detected
in aripiprazole-treated MCAO + CMS mice. In the cell proliferation
analysis for hippocampus, aripiprazole-treated MCAO + CMS mice
showed a signiﬁcant increase of BrdU/NeuN double-positive cells in
the ipsilateral compared with vehicle (Fig. 8). These results suggest
that depressive behaviors are reversed by treatment with aripiprazole through preventing degeneration of dopaminergic neuronal
cells and enhancing neurogenesis.

To compare the effects of CMS on proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, we counted each positive cell
for BrdU and BrdU/NeuN in stratum, hippocampus and midbrain
(Fig. 6). BrdU positive cells were not detected in the midbrain.
MCAO treated mice showed a signiﬁcant increase of BrdU positive cells in the ipsilateral hemisphere compared with CMS or the
contralateral of MCAO, and a limited number of cells showed a
BrdU/NeuN double-positive reaction. BrdU/NeuN double-positive
cells were only observed in the ipsilateral striatum of MCAO and
MCAO + CMS mice, whereas these cells were detected in ipsilateral
and contralateral hippocampus of all three type models. No signiﬁcant change in BrdU/NeuN double-positive cells was observed
between MCAO and MCAO + CMS, however CMS treatment after
MCAO decreased the number of both BrdU and BrdU/NeuN doublepositive cells in the striatum and hippocampus. These results

4. Discussion
We demonstrated an animal model for CMS-treated mice after
ischemic stroke which highlights the potential etiological signiﬁcance of a marked neurodegeneration in lesion and exofocal
sites and decline in neurogenesis. CMS-induced summative neurodegeneration is involved in a developing process of post-stroke
depression. Treatment with adjunctive antidepressant aripiprazole
in this animal model is effective in ameliorating behavioral characteristics of depression via neuroprotection and neurogenesis. Thus
clinical beneﬁts of adjunctive therapy after stroke may be another

approach to prevention and treatment of post-stroke depression.
Our study provides new insight into the summative pathogenesis
of CMS after ischemic stroke and therapeutic target in post-stroke
depression.
Stroke is associated with higher risk of developing depression
[2]. Post-stroke depression is clinically highly signiﬁcant because
it negatively impacts stroke outcome with increased mortality
and poorer functional recovery [1]. A number of risk factors for
this depression, including physical disability, stroke severity, and
cognitive impairment have been established, however, personal
circumstances of patients also have a major impact on mental

striatum and hippocampus, respectively. The number of proliferated neuronal progenitor cells indicated by BrdU positive was signiﬁcantly increased in ipsilateral striatum
and hippocampus of MCAO mice. Decreased number of BrdU/NeuN positive cells was observed in the striatum of MCAO + CMS mice. *P < 0.05 versus MCAO mice; # P < 0.05

health [1,6]. Social deprivation represents a stressful condition
triggering the emergence of depression-like behaviors in the experimental stroke, whereas social interaction improves behavioral
deﬁcits [6–8].
Long-term exposure to a series of unpredictable mild stressors
can lead to development of a state of major depressive disorder involving anhedonia, anxiety and behavioral despair in animal
[19]. Post-stroke depression also shares some common underlying
mechanisms with nonvascular depression; therefore its behavioral
tests are gradually entering the stroke ﬁeld [20]. CMS after ischemic
stroke may strongly inﬂuence depression-related behaviors [9].
Thus we ﬁrst assessed two distinguished kinds of behavioral tests
reﬂecting mood changes and memory to compare their behavioral
results from three animal models. We found that mice chronically exposed to CMS or treated by MCAO generally developed
marked depressive behaviors and memory impairment except
sucrose intake of MCAO. MCAO + CMS mice were shown to exhibit
anxiety-like behavior and anhedonia and despair-like behavior
compared with MCAO mice and despair-like behavior compared
with CMS. With elicited anhedonia and increased anxiety and
despair, MCAO + CMS mice demonstrated signiﬁcant increase of
memory impairment compared with MCS and MCAO mice. These
results suggest the possibility that more severe depressive symptoms and memory impairment were induced in MCAO + CMS mice
as synthetic effects of MCAO and CMS.

Current biological theories of post-stroke depressive disorder are partly interconnected neuronal loss, neuroinﬂammation,
impaired neurogenesis and secondary degenerative changes
[2,4,21]. CMS can enhance tissue injury after experimental stroke
and contributes to severe clinical symptoms of depression via
neuronal loss and degeneration of the brain and impaired neurogenesis [11,13,14]. Signiﬁcant volume loss demonstrated in
the striatum of MCAO + CMS with both slight atrophy of corpus
callosum and midbrain compared with other models. These results
suggest that neuronal loss by CMS or MCAO may represent a
further important pathophysiological consequence of post-stroke
depression.
For volume loss in the striatum, the primary lesion site, fewer
apoptotic cells were demonstrated in striatum of MCAO + CMS
than MCAO. Altered inﬂammatory signaling links underlying major
depression with adverse effect on brain function that inﬂuence the
development of depression [3,6,7]. Performing MCAO increased
the number of activated microglia and mRNA expression of NF␬B in the ipsilateral striatum. More abundant activated microglia
expressing round or oval cell soma with few processes was detected
in MCAO + CMS mice compared with MCAO mice. These results
suggest that MCAO treated mice were pronounced severe volume loss of the striatum by inﬂammatory response of ischemic
damage, and summative neuronal loss by CMS involved in this
response.

Fig. 7. Effects of aripiprazole on depressive behaviors. Open ﬁeld (A), sucrose preference (B), forced swim (C) and Morris water maze tests (D). Aripiprazole signiﬁcantly
recovered depressive behavior at the late phase of the experiment. ARZ, aripiprazole. Mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 versus vehicle mice; # P < 0.05, ## P < 0.01
and ### P < 0.001 versus control mice.

For volume loss in the corpus callosum, we checked density of
white matter in this region because white matter impairment is a
prominent feature of vascular depression. White matter ischemic
lesions are also crucial risk factors for post-stroke depression
as seen in the concept of disconnection syndromes hypothesis
of vascular depression, disrupting neural connections between
regions regulating mood [3,22]. However there were no signiﬁcant changes in the white matter of corpus callosum in all three
models.
For volume loss in the midbrain, neuronal loss may occur in
remote brain areas not directly impacted by the stroke with penumbra area. Secondary extrafocal neurodegeneration either in the
midbrain or in the thalamus is a well-known feature of cerebral
ischemia [23–25]. MCAO mice have delayed degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in ipsilateral midbrain [4]. We noted signiﬁcant
loss of dopaminergic neuronal cell bodies and ﬁbers in ipsilateral substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area of MCAO + CMS
mice. Our histological and immunohistochemical analysis suggests
that CMS after ischemic stroke resulted in pronounced unilateral
dopaminergic neuronal loss in the midbrain as exofocal neurodegeneration.
Psychological stress and depressive-like behaviors are linked
to impairment of plasticity in the adult brain such as proliferation of neural progenitor cells [14]. Neurogenesis in subventricular
zone and dentate gyrus of the brain plays pivotal roles in recovery
from stroke, and this neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus promotes
recovery from learning impairment and depression [2,26]. In the

current study MCAO resulted in up-regulation of adult neurogenesis, however, very limited survival of differentiated neuronal cells
was observed against the total proliferated cells, in accordance
with previous studies [27]. In addition, MCAO + CMS mice showed a
decrease of proliferated and differentiated neuronal cells compared
with MCAO mice. Thus severe depressive behaviors are exerted in
MCAO + CMS mice via inhibition of proliferation and differentiation
of neuronal stem cells by CMS in the brain.
Antidepressants such as SSRIs may exert direct actions on
the brain providing neuroprotection and promoting neurogenesis beyond their effects on depression [2]. Neuroprotection and
neurogenesis against ischemic-induced injury underlie the clinical
beneﬁts of antidepressant therapy after stroke regarding poststroke depression. Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug, was
approved as an adjunct therapy for major depressive disorder in
2007. Aripiprazole with low-dose has been used a combined therapy with a drug from the group of SSRIs and this adjunctive therapy
shows a beneﬁcial effect on post-stroke emotional disorders and
cognitive function [15,16].
We observed that aripiprazole alone possesses clear antidepressant effects in all depressive behaviors examined with recovered
dopaminergic neuronal cells in MCAO + CMS mice. Treatment with
aripiprazole after ischemic stroke also induced proliferation and
differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells in the hippocampus.
These results indicate that antipsychotics may play beneﬁcial
roles in protecting against neurodegeneration and enhancing proliferation and maturation of neuronal progenitor cells. As the

dopaminergic neuron (A) in the ipsilateral of substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (arrows). Photomicrograph (B) and its histogram (C) showed that differentiated

most common antidepressants ﬂuoxetine and paroxetine prevent
degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons with repression of inﬂammatory, antipsychotic aripiprazole also contributes
to its effects through neuronal protection in post-stroke depression [2]. Taken together, CMS after ischemic stroke leads to severe
depressive-like behavior via neurodegeneration in both primary
lesion and secondary exofocal sites with degradation of neurogenesis, and these behavioral and histopathological changes are
reversed by treatment with antipsychotics such as other antidepressants.
