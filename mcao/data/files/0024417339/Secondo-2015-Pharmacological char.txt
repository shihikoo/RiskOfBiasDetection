ABSTRACT: The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), a 10-transmembrane
domain protein mainly involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+
homeostasis, plays a crucial role in cerebral ischemia. In the present paper,
we characterized the eﬀect of the newly synthesized compound 5-amino-Nbutyl-2-(4-ethoxyphenoxy)-benzamide hydrochloride (BED) on the activity
of the three NCX isoforms and on the evolution of cerebral ischemia. BED
inhibited NCX isoform 3 (NCX3) activity (IC50 = 1.9 nM) recorded with the
help of single-cell microﬂorimetry, 45Ca2+ radiotracer ﬂuxes, and patch-clamp
in whole-cell conﬁguration. Furthermore, this drug displayed negligible eﬀect
on NCX2, the other isoform expressed within the CNS, and it failed to
modulate the ubiquitously expressed NCX1 isoform. Concerning the
molecular site of action, the use of chimera strategy and deletion mutagenesis
showed that α1 and α2 repeats of NCX3 represented relevant molecular
determinants for BED inhibitory action, whereas the intracellular regulatory floop was not involved. At 10 nM, BED worsened the damage induced by oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by
reoxygenation in cortical neurons through a dysregulation of [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, at the same concentration, BED signiﬁcantly
enhanced cell death in CA3 subregion of hippocampal organotypic slices exposed to OGD and aggravated infarct injury after
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. These results showed that the newly synthesized 5-amino-N-butyl-2-(4ethoxyphenoxy)-benzamide hydrochloride is one of the most potent inhibitor of NCX3 so far identiﬁed, representing an useful
tool to dissect the role played by NCX3 in the control of Ca2+ homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions.

identiﬁed in mammals. All these three isoforms share the same
topology with the amino terminus located in the extracellular
space, and the carboxyl terminus located in the intracellular
space. The 10-transmembrane segments can be divided into an
N-terminal hydrophobic domain and into a C-terminal
hydrophobic domain, each composed of 5 TMSs. Each group
of 5 TMSs is separated from the other through a large
hydrophilic intracellular loop of 550 amino acids, named f loop9
that is not implicated in Na+ and Ca2+ translocation, but is
responsible for the regulation of NCX activity. Interestingly,

great deal of interest has been devoted to the discovery of
clinically eﬀective drugs against cerebral ischemia, and of
pharmacological tools able to identify potential drugable targets
in this relevant and frequently observed neurological disease.
Interestingly, the modulation of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger
(NCX)1,2 seems to modify the course of the disease. In fact,
either the speciﬁc knock-down or gene ablation of ncx leads to
a worsening of brain damage and neurological deﬁcits induced
in mice and rats by experimentally induced focal ischemia.3,4
NCX is a 10-transmembrane domain protein5 that couples the
eﬄux of Ca2+ to the inﬂux of Na+ into the cell or viceversa by
operating in a bidirectional way. NCX family belongs to a
Cation/Calcium Exchanger Superfamily that includes four
other families. Three diﬀerent genes coding for the three
diﬀerent NCX1,6 NCX2,7 and NCX38 proteins have been

with an approach already published.13 In particular, we
examined the eﬀect of this compound on the activity of NCX
isoforms and on the evolution of cerebral ischemia
experimentally modeled in vitro and in vivo, a complex
pathological process which requires a tight control of Ca2+ and
Na+ homeostasis through NCX.

this function is elicited by several cytoplasmic messengers and
transductional mechanisms, such as Ca2+ and Na+ ions, nitric
oxide (NO),10 phosphatydilinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2),
protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), phosphoarginine (PA), and adenosine trisphosphate (ATP).2 After the
discovery of NCX activity in 1969, studies have reported that
some compounds can interfere with this antiporter.11,12 In the
last 35 years, in fact, several inorganic and organic compounds
have been reported to activate or block the NCX activity.
However, the selectivity of this action has often been
questioned.2 Since then, in an attempt to evaluate NCX
activity, amiloride has been used as a probe to block NCX
function.12 However, two major drawbacks have limited its use.
First, millimolar concentrations are required for its NCX
inhibitory activity; second, it lacks speciﬁcity, since it can also
inhibit both the epithelial Na+ channel at micromolar
concentrations and the Na+/H+ exchanger in the millimolar
range. Later on, in order to overcome the lack of selectivity and
to increase the potency of this drug, additional compounds
belonging to ethoxyanilines, quinazolinone, thiazolidine,
phenoxypyridine, ylacetamide, benzofuran, and imidazoline
derivatives were produced by conventional chemical synthesis.
However, these newly synthesized compounds although
provided with a higher potency did not display the expected
selectivity on the mode of operation of the antiporter and on
the diﬀerent isoforms and splicing variants. In the present paper
we characterize the molecular mechanism of the new
compound 5-amino-N-butyl-2-(4-ethoxyphenoxy)-benzamide
hydrochloride (BED), whose synthesis has been conducted

RESULTS
Eﬀect of BED on NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 Activity
Evaluated as Na+-Dependent [Ca2+]i Increase, Na0+Dependent 45Ca2+ Eﬄux, Nai+-Dependent 45Ca2+ Uptake
and by Patch-Clamp Technique in Stably Transfected
BHK-NCX1, BHK-NCX2, and BHK-NCX3 Cells. In order to
evaluate the eﬀect on each isoform of the exchanger of BED,
whose structure has been reported at the top of Figure 1, NCX
activity was assessed as Nai+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake and
Na0+-dependent 45Ca2+ eﬄux in stably transfected BHK-NCX1,
BHK-NCX2 and BHK-NCX3 cells in the presence of diﬀerent
concentrations of the biphenyl ether derivative and in BHK
Wild type (BHK-Wt) (Figure 1). As a matter of course, Na+free solution failed to produce Nai+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake in
BHK-Wt cells (Figure 1A). However, in stably transfected
BHK-NCX1, BHK-NCX2, and BHK-NCX3 cells, the eﬀect of
BED was evaluated on the maximum rate of NCX activation
(100%) elicited by Na+-free. BED was able to reduce the
reverse mode of operation of NCX2 and NCX3, but not of
NCX1, in a dose-dependent manner with the following IC50:
3.49 nM for NCX2 and 1.89 nM for NCX3 (Figure 1A). The
ability of BED to reduce 45Ca2+ eﬄux was also studied by using

indicated concentrations, was added 10 min before Na+-free application. Values represent means ± SEM of three diﬀerent experiments. The
percentage of [Ca2+]i increase after Na+-free perfusion was calculated as Δ% of plateau/basal value. For each of the three experiments, 10−20
individual cells were monitored. *p < 0.05 versus its control group; **p < 0.05 versus its previous concentrations and control; ∧p < 0.05 versus its
control group; ∧∧p < 0.05 versus its previous concentrations, control, and the same concentration on NCX2.

Ca2+-free-Na+ containing solution plus 2 mM EGTA, as
reported in Methods. Cells were exposed to the abovementioned solution for 10 s, a time in which no eﬄux was
detected in BHK Wild type cells (Figure 1B). Interestingly,
only the forward mode of NCX3 was reduced by the drug in a
dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 2.24 nM (Figure 1B).
Furthermore, NCXs activity was also studied by Fura-2AM
video-imaging on single-cell as Na+ gradient-dependent [Ca2+]i
increase elicited by a single pulse of Na+-deﬁcient NMDG+
medium (Na+-free). To dissect [Ca2+]i increase due to NCX
component from the other contributors, cells were treated with
thapsigargin, a speciﬁc and irreversible inhibitor of the
sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum ATPase SERCA. Before perfusion, cells were exposed for 10 min to thapsigargin (1 μM) in
order to deplete the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to
prevent Ca2+ reﬁlling into ER upon Na+-free administration.
With this protocol, thapsigargin did not interfere with Na+-freeinduced NCX activation (data not shown). In BHK-NCX3 and
BHK-NCX2 cells, Na+-free perfusion caused a rapid rise in
[Ca2+]i through the reverse mode of operation that was reduced
by BED in dose dependent way (0.00001−10 μM) with the
IC50’s of 1 nM for NCX3 and 9 nM for NCX2, respectively
(Figure 2). As a matter of course, Na+-free solution failed to
elicit [Ca2+]i rise in wild-type BHK cells (BHK-Wt) (Figure 2),
which lacked all three NCX isoforms.14 Furthermore, the eﬀect

of BED on NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 activity was more directly
assessed by the patch-clamp technique in whole cell
conﬁguration in stably transfected BHK cells. The whole-cell
current was measured at +60 and −120 mV using the rampclamp protocol (see Methods). To isolate NCX currents
(INCX), cells were recorded for 5 min with the well-known NCX
inhibitor NiCl2 (5 mM). The Ni2+-sensitive component,
representing the isolated INCX, was obtained as previously
reported.15 No current corresponding to INCX was recorded in
BHK-Wt cells (Figure 3). The incubation with BED strongly
inhibited both the outward (reverse mode) and inward
(forward mode) direction of INCX3 in dose-dependent way
with the following IC50: 0.62 nM for NCX3 reverse mode and
1.01 nM for NCX3 forward mode. However, only the reverse
mode of operation of NCX2 was aﬀected by the drug with an
IC50 of 1.08 nM (Figure 3). The IC50 of BED on NCX3 reverse
and forward modes of operation were compared with those of
3-amino-6-chloro-5-[(4-chloro-benzyl)amino]-N-[[(2,4dimethylbenzyl)amino]iminomethyl]-pyrazinecarboxamide
(CB-DMB) (Table 1). BED, in the same experimental
conditions, showed a higher potency than CB-DMB in
inhibiting NCX3 activity (Table 1). Furthermore, BED
inhibited also TTX-sensitive Na+ currents recorded in GH3
cells with an IC50 of 8.1 μM while CB-DMB inhibited TTXsensitive Na+ currents with an IC50 of 1.6 μM.15

diﬀerent sensitivity to BED. Particularly, the eﬀect of BED was
studied in N3-227/469 and N3-707/776 chimeras obtained by
substituting the BED-insensitive NCX1 regions 227/469 and
707/776 with the homologous segments in NCX3 structure.
Fura-2 microﬂuorimetry showed that the activity in the reverse
mode of these two chimeras was inhibited by BED (10 nM) in
the same extent as NCX3 Wt (Figure 4C,D). In fact, Na+-free
perfusion caused a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i that was reduced in the
presence of BED (10 nM) in both in N3-227/469 and N3-707/
776 chimeras as well as in NCX3 wild type (Figure 4G).
Finally, we substituted the NCX3 region corresponding to the
α1 repeat with the homologous 143−167 segment of NCX1,
thus producing the chimera named N3-143/167 (Figure 4E).
Furthermore, a chimera between NCX3 and NCX1, named
N3-777/818, was produced by introducing in the NCX3
region, corresponding to the α2 repeat, the homologous NCX1
sequence 777/818 (Figure 4F). Fura-2 microﬂuorimetry
showed that the activity of these two chimeras was not aﬀected
by BED (10 nM) (Figure 4G). In fact, Na+-free perfusion
caused a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i that remained unchanged in the
presence of BED (10 nM) in both N3-143/167 and N3-777/
818 chimeras (Figure 4E−G). The eﬀect of BED on NCX
activity was also determined in the previous described mutant
and chimeras by means of Na+-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake in the
presence of 10 nM of the biphenyl ether derivative (Figure
4H). BED was able to signiﬁcantly inhibit Na+-dependent
45
Ca2+ uptake in NCX3Δf and in N3-227/469 and N3-707/776
chimeras as well as in NCX3 Wt, while it failed to change Na+dependent 45Ca2+ uptake in N3-143/167 and N3-777/818

Lacking “f-loop” or NCX1/NCX3 Chimeras Assessed by
Na+-Dependent [Ca2+]i Increase and Nai+-Dependent

Ca2+ Uptake in Stably Transfected BHK Cells. To
investigate the molecular determinants of BED on the
molecular structure of NCX3 isoform, the intracellular f-loop,
a region mainly involved in the regulation of NCX function,
was deleted in NCX3 cDNA (NCX3Δf) (Figure 4A).
Interestingly, Fura 2-AM single-cell video-imaging experiments
revealed that the elimination of the f-loop did not produce any
change in the action proﬁle exerted by the biphenyl ether
derivative on NCX3 activity (Figure 4B). In fact, Na+-free
perfusion caused a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i that was reduced in the
presence of BED by the same extent in both NCX3Δf and in
NCX3 wild type (Figure 4). These data suggested the existence
of an inhibitory site located outside the intracellular f-loop of
NCX3 structure. To establish the site responsible for BEDmediated down-regulation of NCX3 activity, we generated four
chimeras between NCX3 and NCX1 taking advantage on their

regions of NCX3 were involved in the inhibitory eﬃcacy of the
biphenyl ether derivative.
Eﬀect of BED on Neuronal Survival in Organotypic
Hippocampal Cultures Exposed to Oxygen/Glucose
Deprivation (OGD). The exposure of hippocampal organotypic slices to OGD in the presence of 0.01 μM BED
signiﬁcantly enhanced cell death in CA3 subregion compared to
OGD itself, as demonstrated by the increase in PI uptake
(Figure 5A−D). However, no signiﬁcant eﬀect of BED
exposure was observed in CA1 and DG hippocampal
subregions exposed to OGD (Figure 5B,C). The more severe
cell death observed in CA3 subregion as compared to CA1 and
DG upon BED exposure might be due to the blockade of
NCX3 in that regions where this exchanger isoform is greater
expressed.3,16 The presence of higher BED concentration (10
μM) in the incubation media per se did not aﬀect neuronal
viability in this preparation (Figure 5B−D).
Eﬀect of BED on [Ca2+]i and Cell Survival of Cortical
Neurons Exposed to OGD Plus Reoxygenation and on
Infarct Volume in Mice Subjected to tMCAo. Primary
cortical neurons treated with 10 nM BED and exposed to 2 h
OGD followed by 24 h reoxygenation displayed a signiﬁcant
increase in [Ca2+]i as compared to OGD followed by

reoxygenation alone (Figure 6A) and vehicle treated group.
Furthermore, the addition of 10 nM BED enhanced cell death
induced by 2 h OGD followed by 24 h reoxygenation (Figure
6B). On the other hand time-course experiments, evaluating
basal toxicity of BED on BHK-NCX3 cells, showed that this
drug did not induce any toxicity even at 100 μM (data not
shown). Moreover, BED icv administered (1 μL) at a
concentration of 500 nM dramatically increased the extent of
the ischemic lesion in C57/BL6 male mice subjected to 60 min
of MCAO followed by 24 h of reperfusion as compared to
vehicle administered mice (percent of ischemic damage was
21.0 ± 0.8 in the vehicle treated group and 39.1 ± 1.6 in the
BED treated group, respectively) (Figure 6C). Particularly, the
enlargement of the ischemic core in these mice was particularly
evident in the more peripheral temporoparietal cortex (9.36 ±
0.9 vs 28.36 ± 1.6) (Figure 6C).

action. Interestingly, these regions represent common molecular determinants required for nitric oxide to downregulate
NCX3 activity,9 for neurounina-1 to increase20 NCX1, and for
KB-R7943, SEA0400, and SN-6 to block21 NCX1. Accordingly,
the substitution of these BED-sensitive regions of NCX3 with
the corresponding BED-insensitive regions of NCX1 prevented
the inhibitory eﬀect exerted by the drug on NCX3. This
suggests that the molecular determinant of NCX3 was found
outside the f-loop, at the level of both the α1 and α2 repeats. As
concerns the selectivity of BED against other channels, our
results showed that this drug inhibited TTX-sensitive Na+
currents with an IC50 of 8.1 μM that was signiﬁcantly larger
than that recorded for NCX3 blockade. However, the inhibition
of voltage-gated Na+ channels should prevent instead of worsen
hypoxia-induced neuronal injury, thus suggesting that the
detrimental eﬀects of the drug on neuronal viability may be
ascribe to the most prominent blockade of NCX3 activity. In
this respect, we have previously demonstrated that either the
speciﬁc knock-down or gene ablation of ncx3 leads to a
worsening of brain damage and neurological deﬁcits induced in
mice and rats by experimentally induced focal ischemia.3,4 The
present results obtained with BED on ischemic brain volumes
was in line with the above-mentioned results and with those
obtained in primary neurons derived from ncx3−/− mice
subjected to OGD.4 In the present study, the administration of
the drug during the OGD phase rendered cortical neurons
more vulnerable to the reoxygenation phase as occurs for
ncx3−/− cortical neurons compared with ncx3+/+ neurons when

of the newly synthesized compound, BED was drawn taking
into consideration the chemical structure of a well-known NCX
inhibitor, SEA0400.17 In particular, compared with the
SEA0400 structure, the biphenyl ether moiety was maintained
unaltered. In addition, two new groups, an amino group and an
amide group, were inserted on one of the two benzene rings.
These chemical modiﬁcations have produced dramatic changes
in the biological activity of this compound, determining a high
NCX3 isoform selectivity and potency never found in any other
NCX inhibitor so far described. In fact, the potency of BED
(i.e., IC50 = 1 nM) is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the
amiloride derivative 3-amino-6-chloro-5-[(4-chloro-benzyl)amino]-N-[[(2,4-dimethylbenzyl)amino]iminomethyl]-pyrazinecarboxamide (CB-DMB)15 used as reference drug in the
present study and of the new isothyourea derivative YM244769 which is the most potent available NCX3 inhibitor
working in the nanomolar range.18 However, YM-244769
inhibits NCX3 only in the reverse mode of operation, whereas
BED inhibits NCX3 when it acts bidirectionally. Interestingly,
the substitution on the amino group with an acetamide group
abolishes the eﬀect on NCX (data not shown), thus showing
that the amino group plays an important role in the inhibitory
eﬀect exerted by the newly synthesized drug. The use of
deletion mutagenesis showed that the intracellular f-loop of
NCX3, which is involved in the activity regulation of the
antiporter,2,19 is not involved in BED inhibitory action. In
contrast, the use of NCX1/NCX3 chimeras revealed that both
the α1 and α2 repeats were mainly involved in BED inhibitory

more, in the same experimental conditions, BHK cells singly
transfected with NCX3 show a greater resistance to hypoxia
plus reoxygenation, maintaining the ability to buﬀer intracellular Ca2+ overload.14 This property might be correlated with
the ability of NCX3 to operate, unlike the other two NCX
isoforms expressed in the brain, NCX1 and NCX2, even when
ATP levels are reduced.14 As matter of fact, the three NCX
isoforms display a diﬀerent sensitivity to ATP levels.27 In
particular, during ATP depletion, NCX1 and NCX2 isoform
activity is reduced, whereas NCX3 is still operative.27 In
agreement with this speciﬁc function proposed for NCX3, our
previous experiments in vivo, entailing the induction of
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, have
demonstrated that NCX3 mRNA is upregulated 24 h after the
injury in brain regions belonging to the periinfarct area.28 This
NCX3 upregulation, as opposed to NCX2 downregulation, has
been interpreted as a compensatory mechanism that counterbalances the reduced activity of NCX2 protein, thus counteracting the dysregulation of [Ca2+]i homeostasis in the surviving
neurons of the penumbra zone.28 This suggests a crucial role of
neuronal NCX3 isoform in modulating [Ca2+]i homeostasis
under hypoxic conditions. Collectively, the results obtained in
the present research work indicate that BED is the most potent

exposed to the hypoxic conditions. This eﬀect was possibly due
to the increased [Ca2+]i recorded in the reoxygenation phase in
the presence of BED in comparison to the reoxygenation phase
alone, thus reinforcing the importance of NCX3 in buﬀering
[Ca2+]i under hypoxic conditions. Accordingly, the damage of
CA3 area in organotypic cultures was particularly exacerbated
during OGD in the presence of BED. However, no signiﬁcant
eﬀect of the drug was observed in CA1 and DG hippocampal
sub regions exposed to OGD. This diﬀerent vulnerability of
CA3 region to NCX3 inhibition exerted by BED might be
ascribed to the greater expression of this isoform in CA3
compared with CA1 and DG sub regions.3,16 Furthermore,
BED, icv administered, dramatically increased the extent of the
ischemic lesion in rats after MCAO followed by reperfusion,
thus producing the impairment of several functions. Accordingly, mice lacking ncx3 gene exhibit reduced motor activity,
weakness of forelimb muscles, and fatigability in comparison
with ncx3+/+ mice.22 Furthermore, ncx3−/− mice exhibit
hypomyelination that is accompanied by a reduction of spinal
cord size23,24 and displays an impairment in hippocampal longterm potentiation and spatial learning and memory.25 At the
cellular level, NCX3 extrudes Ca2+ from mitochondria, thus
protecting neurons exposed to hypoxic conditions.26 Further1367

Krebs medium to Na+-deﬁcient NMDG+ medium (Na+-free) (in
mM): 5.5 KCl, 147 N-methyl glucamine, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 10
glucose, and 10 Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4).14,33
Measurement of Na+-Dependent 45Ca2+ Uptake and 45Ca2+
Eﬄux. 45Ca2+ inﬂux into the cells was measured by the method
previously described.14 After treatments, cells cultured in 24-well
dishes were incubated in normal Krebs (in mM): 5.5 KCl, 145 NaCl,
1.2 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4
containing 1 mM ouabain and 10 μM monensin at 37 °C for 10 min.
Then, 45Ca2+ uptake was initiated by switching the normal Krebs
medium to Na+-free NMDG (in mM): 5.5 KCl, 147 N-methyl Dglucamine (NMDG), 1.2 MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HepesNaOH (pH 7.4) containing 10 μM 45Ca2+ (74 KBq/mL) and 1 mM
ouabain. After 30 s incubation, cells were washed with an ice-cold
solution containing 2 mM La3+ to stop 45Ca2+ uptake. Cells were
subsequently solubilized with 0.1 N NaOH and aliquots were taken to
determine radioactivity and protein content.34 To measure 45Ca2+
eﬄux, cells were loaded with 1 μM 45Ca2+ (74 KBq/mL) together with
1 μM ionomycin for 60 s in normal Krebs. Next, cells were exposed
either to a Ca2+- and Na+-free solution (a condition that blocks both
intracellular 45Ca2+ eﬄux and extracellular Ca2+ inﬂux) or to a Ca2+free plus 2 mM EGTA containing 145 mM Na+ (a condition that
promotes 45Ca2+ eﬄux). Thapsigargin at 1 μM was present in both
solutions. 45Ca2+ eﬄux was started by using Ca2+-free-Na+ containing
solution plus 2 mM EGTA. Cells were exposed to this solution, which
promotes 45Ca2+ eﬄux, for 10 s. At the time chosen (10 s), no eﬄux
was detected in BHK-Wilde cells. Na0+-dependent 45Ca2+ eﬄux was
estimated by subtracting 45Ca2+ eﬄux in Ca2+- and Na+-free from that
in Ca2+-free solution. Cells were subsequently solubilized with 0.1 N
NaOH, and aliquots were taken to determine radioactivity and protein
content by Bradford method.34
Electrophysiology. All currents were recorded by patch-clamp
technique in whole-cell conﬁguration using a Digidata 1322A interface
(Molecular Devices). Data were acquired and analyzed using the
pClamp software (version 9.0, Molecular Devices). The currents were
recorded by ﬁre-polished borosilicate electrodes with a ﬁnal resistance
of 2.5−4 MΩ ﬁlled with a speciﬁc internal solution. INCX ﬁltered at 5
kHz was recorded from BHK wild type (Wt) and BHK-NCX1,
-NCX2, and -NCX3 stably transfected cells.10,15 Brieﬂy, INCX was
recorded starting from a holding potential of −60 mV up to a shortstep depolarization at +60 mV (60 ms).35 Then, a descending voltage
ramp from +60 to −120 mV was applied. The current recorded in the
descending portion of the ramp (from +60 to −120 mV) was used to
plot the current−voltage (I−V) relation curve. The magnitudes of INCX
were measured at the end of +60 mV (reverse mode) and at the end of
−120 mV (forward mode), respectively. The Ni2+-insensitive
components were subtracted from total currents to isolate INCX.
External Ringer solution contained (in mM): 126 NaCl, 1.2 NaHPO4,
2.4 KCl, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 glucose and 18 NaHCO3, 20 TEA,
10 nM TTX, and 10 μM nimodipine (pH 7.4). The dialysing pipet
solution contained (mM): 100 K-gluconate, 10 tetraethylammonium
(TEA), 20 NaCl, 1 Mg-ATP, and 0.1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 0.75 EGTA,
Hepes 10, adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. TEA (20 mM) and Cs were
included to block delayed outward rectiﬁer K+ components,
nimodipine (10 μM) and TTX (50 nM) were added to external
solution to block L-type Ca-channels and TTX-sensitive Na+-channels,
respectively. INCX values were normalized for membrane capacitance.
TTX-sensitive Na+ currents were recorded in pituitary GH3 cells as
previously shown.15 For TTX-sensitive Na+ channel recordings,
pituitary GH3 cells were perfused with an extracellular Ringer solution
containing 20 mM TEA and 5 μM nimodipine. The pipettes were
ﬁlled with (in mM): 110 CsCl, 10 TEA, 2 MgCl2, 10 EGTA, 8 glucose,
2 Mg-ATP, 0.25 cAMP, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3. TTX-sensitive Na+currents were recorded by applying, from an holding potential of −70
mV, depolarizing voltage steps of 50 ms duration in 10 mV from −100
to +50 mV elicited at 0.066 Hz frequency (1 pulse every 15 s). The
current−voltage relationship of Na+ currents were obtained normalizing the peak value for the membrane voltage imposed during the
step.

and selective inhibitor of NCX3 so far identiﬁed, and suggest
that this compound may represent a useful tool to dissect the
diﬀerential role played by NCX3 isoform in all those diseases
that require a tight control of Ca2+ homeostasis through NCX3
function.

METHODS

Cell Culture, Cortical Neurons, and Organotypic Hippocampal Slice Cultures. Stably transfected Baby Hamster Kidney
(BHK) cells with canine cardiac NCX1, rat brain NCX2, or NCX3
were grown on plastic dishes in a mix of DMEM and Ham’s F12 media
(1:1) (Invitrogen, MI, Italy) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine
serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO).14 Cortical neurons were prepared from brains of 16-dayold Wistar rat embryos (Charles River) as previously reported29,33 and
used at 7−10 days in vitro. Cells were cultured in a humidiﬁed 5%
CO2 atmosphere, and the culture medium was changed every 2 days.
For microﬂuorimetric and electrophysiological studies, cells were
seeded on glass coverslips (Fisher, Springﬁeld, NJ) coated with poly-Llysine (30 μg/mL) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and used at least 12 h after
seeding. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSCs) were
prepared as previously described.30 Brieﬂy, 400 μm thick coronal brain
slices from P5−P7 mouse pups were used. To increase the
reproducibility of the data, two consecutive slices from the two
hippocampi of the same animal were always dissected at the same level
in all the experimental groups. Slices were grown on semi permeable
ﬁlter inserts (Millipore, GIBCO, Italy) in six-well plates containing
culture medium (50% minimum essential medium, 25% Hank’s
balanced salt solution, 25% heat inactivated horse serum, 5 mg/mL
glucose, 1 mM glutamine, 1% Fungizone). The culture period was 14
days in vitro.
Generation and Stable Expression of Wild-Type and Mutant
Exchangers. BHK cell lines, expressing dog heart NCX1.1, rat brain
NCX2.1 and NCX3.3 were generous gift from Dr. Kenneth Philipson
(UCLA, Los Angeles, CA). Deletion mutant NCX3, NCX3Δf, was
obtained deleting amino acidic region 292−708 of rat brain NCX3
cDNA by means of quikchange site-directed mutagenesis kit
(Stratagene, Italy). cDNA of NCX1/NCX3 chimeras were obtained
from Dr. Takahiro Iwamoto (Fukuoka University, Japan). To stably
express chimeric and mutant exchangers, pKCRH or pCEFL plasmids
carrying exchanger cDNAs were transfected in the presence of
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Italy) into wild-type BHK cell line.
Cell clones highly expressing Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity were selected
by a Ca2+-killing procedure with the Ca2+ ionophore Ionomycin. In the
presence of this ionophore, cells not expressing the exchanger died for
Ca2+ overload.31
[Ca2+]i Measurement. [Ca2+]i was measured by single cell
computer-assisted video imaging as previously shown.14 Brieﬂy, BHK
cells, grown on glass coverslips, were loaded with 6 μM Fura-2
acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2AM) for 30 min at 37 °C in normal Krebs
solution containing the following (in mM): 5.5 KCl, 160 NaCl, 1.2
MgCl2, 1.5 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4. At the
end of the Fura-2AM loading period, the coverslips were placed into a
perfusion chamber (Medical System, Co. Greenvale, NY) mounted
onto the stage of an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a FLUAR 40× oil objective lens. The
experiments were carried out with a digital imaging system composed
of a MicroMax 512BFT cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments,
Trenton, NJ, USA), LAMBDA 10-2 ﬁlter wheeler (Sutter Instruments,
Novato, CA), and Meta-Morph/MetaFluor Imaging System software
(Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). After loading, cells were
alternatively illuminated at wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm by a xenon
lamp. The emitted light was passed through a 512 nm barrier ﬁlter.
Fura-2 ﬂuorescence intensity was measured every 3 s. Forty to sixtyﬁve individual cells were selected and monitored simultaneously from
each coverslip. All the results are presented as cytosolic Ca2+
concentration. Assuming that the KD for FURA-2 was 224 nM, the
equation of Grynkiewicz32 was used for calibration. NCX activity,
shown NCX reverse mode was determined by switching the normal

Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation. Hypoxic conditions were
induced by exposing hippocampal cultures to oxygen- and glucose-free
medium in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 95% nitrogen and 5%
CO2.36 After 25 min of OGD followed by 24 h of reoxygenation, cell
injury was assessed using the ﬂuorescent dye propidium iodide (PI)
(Invitrogen). Its uptake was recorded with a digital camera (Media
Cybernetics, Silver Springs, MD) mounted on a Nikon Eclipse 400
ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments, Florence, Italy). For
densitometric measurements, the digital photos were analyzed with the
Image Pro-Plus software (Media Cybernetics), after freehand outlining
of the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) neuronal layers was
performed as previously described.37 Densitometric data were
obtained by an integrated algorithm that considers the mean of
optical density.30 In primary cortical neurons, cell injury was assessed
after 3 h of OGD followed by 21 h of reoxygenation. PI (7 μM) and
ﬂuorescein diacetate (FDA; 36 μM) positive cells were counted in
three representative high-power ﬁelds of independent cultures, and cell
death was determined by the ratio of the number of PI-positive cells/
PI FDA positive cells.
Experimental Groups for in Vivo Studies. C57/BL6 mice
(Charles River, Italy) aged between 6 and 8 weeks and weighing 27−
30 g were housed under diurnal lighting conditions. Experiments were
performed according to the international guidelines for animal
research and approved by the Animal Care Committee of “Federico
II”, University of Naples, Italy.
Transient Middle-Cerebral Artery Occlusion Model (tMCAo).
Mice were subjected to tMCAo as previously described.38 A 5-0 nylon
ﬁlament was inserted through the external carotid artery stump and
advanced into the left internal carotid artery until it blocked the origin
of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). After 60 min MCA occlusion,
the ﬁlament was withdrawn to restore blood ﬂow.
Monitoring of Blood Gas Concentration and Cerebral Blood
Flow (CBF) with Laser-Doppler Flowmetry. A catheter was
inserted into the femoral artery to measure arterial blood gases before
and after ischemia (Rapid lab 860; Chiron Diagnostic). CBF was
monitored in the cerebral cortex ipsilateral to the occluded MCA with
a laser-Doppler ﬂowmeter (Periﬂux system, 5000). Once a stable CBF
signal was obtained, the MCA was occluded. CBF monitoring was
continued up to 30 min after the end of the surgical procedure, when
the occurred reperfusion was veriﬁed.
Evaluation of the Ischemic Volume. Mice were sacriﬁced 24 h
after ischemia. Ischemic volume was evaluated by 2,3,5-triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining.39 The infarct area was calculated
with image analysis software (Image-Pro Plus).3 The total infarct
volume was expressed as percentage of the volume of the hemisphere
ipsilateral to the lesion.3 Ischemic volumes were evaluated in a blind
manner.
Drugs, Statistical Analysis, and Determination of IC50’s. BED
was solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide at concentrations of 1 mM, and
stock solutions were kept at −20 °C. Appropriate drug dilutions were
prepared daily. Statistical analysis was performed with 2-way ANOVA,
followed by Newman-Keuel’s test. Statistical signiﬁcance was accepted
at the 95% conﬁdence level (p < 0.05). Values are expressed as means
± SEM. To obtain IC50’s of BED, all data were ﬁtted to the following
binding isotherm: y = max/(11X/IC50)n, where X is the drug
concentration and n is the Hill coeﬃcient.
