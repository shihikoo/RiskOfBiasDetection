Background and Purpose—Ischemic stroke has been shown to cause hypermetabolism of glucose in the ischemic penumbra.
Experimental and clinical data indicate that infarct-related systemic hyperglycemia is a potential therapeutic target in
acute stroke. However, clinical studies aiming for glucose control in acute stroke have neither improved functional
outcome nor reduced mortality. Thus, further studies on glucose metabolism in the ischemic brain are warranted.
Methods—We used a rat model of stroke that preserves collateral flow. The animals were analyzed by [2-18F]-2-fluoro-2deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography or magnetic resonance imaging during 90-minute occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery and during 60 minutes after reperfusion. Results were correlated to magnetic resonance imaging of cerebral
blood flow, diffusion of water, lactate formation, and histological data on cell death and blood–brain barrier breakdown.
Results—We detected an increased [2-18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose uptake within ischemic regions succumbing to
infarction and in the peri-infarct region. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed impairment of blood flow to ischemic
levels in the infarct and a reduction of cerebral blood flow in the peri-infarct region. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy
revealed lactate in the ischemic region and absence of lactate in the peri-infarct region. Immunohistochemical analyses
revealed apoptosis and blood–brain barrier breakdown within the infarct.
Conclusions—The increased uptake of [2-18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose in cerebral ischemia most likely reflects
hypermetabolism of glucose meeting increased energy needs of ischemic and hypoperfused brain tissue, and it occurs
under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions measured by local lactate production. Infarct-related systemic hyperglycemia
could serve to facilitate glucose supply to the ischemic brain. Glycemic control by insulin treatment could negatively
influence this mechanism.   (Stroke. 2015;46:835-842. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.008407.)

ncreased local brain glucose metabolism in a rat model of
middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion was described by
Ginsberg et al1 in a seminal article from 1977. Studies using
different experimental approaches have investigated the role
of regional hypermetabolism of glucose in the pathophysiology after hypoperfusion of the brain.2–11 This phenomenon has
been shown in positron emission tomographic (PET) studies of acute human ischemic stroke (IS) and of postasphyctic
infants.12,13 Various explanations for the frequent observations
of hyperglycemia in IS and the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia on brain tissue have been proposed.14 Higher levels of blood glucose have been shown to be predictive for a
more severe stroke and an increased functional impairment
in humans, and therefore hyperglycemia is increasingly being

considered as a therapeutic target in IS.15 However, in a recent
clinical trial in which insulin treatment was used in patients
with acute IS, a poorer outcome in the normoglycemic control
group was observed.16 A recent review by Cochrane concluded
that there is no reliable evidence for glucose control in acute
IS.17 Considering that the pathophysiological mechanisms for
hyperglycemia in stroke remain largely unknown, further preclinical studies are warranted.
The study of glucose hypermetabolism in experimental
stroke has been limited by the lack of clinically relevant
stroke models. The frequently used filament MCA occlusion
technique for inducing IS in rodents causes obstruction of collateral flow from MCA-adjacent vascular territories. In other
words, the filament occludes the anterior cerebral artery and

the posterior communicating artery, which in the rodent is the
main contributor to the posterior cerebral artery. This results
in infarctions of entire cortical and subcortical regions.18,19
Furthermore, models commonly used for IS provide reperfusion that is unpredictable, which makes imaging studies
during reperfusion difficult. In the present study, we used a
recently described model for inducing a small focal cortical
infarction that preserves collateral flow,20 and analyzed the
metabolism using a small animal PET scanner. This experimental setup made it possible to determine the distribution
and temporal changes in the use of [2-18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy18
d-glucose ([ F]FDG) in the same animal during occlusion
and reperfusion. Using the same experimental protocol as for
the small animal PET experiments, we performed high-field
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF), diffusion of water (diffusion-weighted
imaging), and lactate formation by MR spectroscopy. Further
validation was performed with histological analyses of cell
death and blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown.
This study allowed us to investigate the regional dynamics
of [18F]FDG uptake as an indicator of glucose metabolism in
relation to CBF, diffusion of water, and immunohistochemical
outcome, in a clinically relevant rat model of focal stroke with
preserved collateral circulation.

Materials and Methods
Animal Preparation
All experiments were conducted according to the regulations of
the Karolinska Institutet and were approved by the local laboratory animal ethics committee. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (355–450
g; Scanbur, Sollentuna, Sweden) were subjected to microwire occlusion of the M2 branch of the MCA (M2CAO), as previously
described (groups 1–6; n=25).20 Imaging studies and postmortem
analyses were performed as shown in Table. Animals were anesthetized using 2% isoflurane (Virbac, Carros Cedex, France) blended
with air–O2 (7:3) during surgery and imaging. In group 2, blood glucose levels were assessed immediately before and 60 minutes after
retraction of the microwire by analyzing tail artery blood samples
with a glucometer (HemoCue 210+/201RT; HemoCue, Ängelholm,
Sweden).

Positron Emission Tomography
Imaging Protocol
In vivo PET investigations were performed on a Focus 120 (CTI
Concorde Microsystems, Knoxville, TN) small animal PET scanner.
Animals in groups 1 and 2 were placed in the PET scanner with the
brain in the field of view within 5 minutes after placement of the
microwire in the MCA. [18F]FDG was administered via the tail vein
(20–40 MBq, 500 μL). Data were collected continuously during 90
minutes from the time of injection. Next, the microwire was retracted, and a second injection of [18F]FDG was administered via the tail
vein (20–40 MBq, 500 μL) followed by data collection every second
during 60 minutes from the time of reperfusion. Animals in group 2
also underwent a follow-up MRI 24 hours after M2CAO. Animals in
group 3 were placed in the PET scanner with the brain in the field of
view 24 hours after 90 minutes of M2CAO.

Quantification Method
A macroparameter analysis method was used in addition to time–activity curves of the standardized uptake values (SUV).21 A volume of
interest (VOI) with a predetermined size was drawn over the innominate artery using a PET image summed during the first 5 minutes of

influx constant as a quantification of the net uptake of the radiotracer.
The VOIs were chosen using a dual-modality approach, where both a
PET and an MRI image were obtained for some animals (n=6).

MRI
Imaging Protocol
The MRI experiments were conducted using a horizontal 9.4-T
magnet (Varian, Yarnton, United Kingdom). Within 5 minutes after
placement of the microwire in the M2 branch of the MCA, animals
in groups 4 and 5 were placed in the MRI scanner and were imaged
using diffusion-weighted imaging, arterial spin labeling, and pointresolved spectroscopy. Diffusion tensor images were acquired using
multislice 3-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence with repetition time (TR) 3 s, and echo time (TE) 25 ms; diffusion-sensitizing
gradients were applied along 12 directions with 2 diffusion-sensitizing factors b=0 and 1000 s/mm2. Perfusion measurements were performed using 3-shot gradient echo-planar imaging with a TE of 10.5
ms and 14 slices of 1-mm thickness with no gap in between. 1H MRI
spectra were acquired using point-resolved spectroscopy sequence
from a VOI (2.5×1.7×2.5 mm3). Imaging data were collected during
90 minutes. After 90 minutes, the microwire was retracted followed
by data collection for an additional 60 minutes.

Immunohistochemistry

The animals in groups 1 to 3 were euthanized at 24 hours after
M2CAO, and animals in group 4 were euthanized 48 to 96 hours after
M2CAO. The brains from animals in groups 2, 4, and 6 were removed
and snap frozen. The animals in groups 2 and 6 were injected with
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–dextran (4 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich;
500 mL of 50 mg/mL; group 6, n=3) and after 24 hours (group 2,
n=4). The animals were euthanized 15 minutes after the injection.
Animals in group 6 were euthanized 10 minutes after reperfusion,

after the 90 minutes of M2CAO. Six coronal 2 mm cryosections
were taken throughout the brain and immersed in a 2% solution of
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride for photography.
To visualize apoptotic staining, the ApopTag Fluorescein or
ApopTag Red Detection kits were used. After an overnight incubation, sections were incubated in blocking buffer containing antirabbit
and antirat secondary antibodies (1/200, Jackson). All sections were
counterstained with the nuclear marker Hoechst (1/5000) and mounted with polyvinyl alcohol/glycerol containing 2.5% DABCO (Sigma).
Fluorescence microscope images were acquired on a Vslide slide
scanning microscope (MetaSystems, Alltlussheim, Germany). Whole
microscope slides were scanned at ×2.5, and tissue was detected
based on the Hoechst 33342 signal. Images were stitched to generate a large 4-channel fluorescence image of the entire specimen with
microscopic resolution.

PET data were processed with small animal PET manager and evaluated using the Inveon Research Workplace (Siemens Healthcare,
Erlangen, Germany) software. MRI data were processed with VnmrJ
software (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) and evaluated using
ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). T2-weighted
MR images and PET images from animals in group 1 and 2 were coregistered and analyzed using the Inveon Research Workplace. Three sets
of VOIs were defined for PET images. (1) In groups 1 and 2 (n=9), a
VOI encompassing the brain regions with elevated [18F]FDG uptake including neighboring regions was manually traced by visual assessment.
Next, thresholding was performed to select a final VOI including voxels with elevated [18F]FDG uptake. (2) In group 2 (n=6), 2 sets of VOIs
were generated using coregistered images from MRI and PET. One
VOI was generated from manually tracing regions of interest matching
the final infarct. The other was generated by subtracting the infarct VOI
from the VOI containing regions showing elevated [18F]FDG uptake.
For spectroscopy analyses in animals in group 4 (n=4), 1 voxel
was centered in the area displaying restricted diffusion on the diffusion tensor images. In animals in group 5 (n=3), 2 separate voxels
were centered in the area displaying restricted diffusion and in brain
regions adjacent to the restricted diffusion.
For CBF analyses in animals in group 4 (n=4), we coregistered
sequentially acquired arterial spin labeling images with the diffusionweighted imaging image acquired at 60 minutes after reperfusion.
One VOI was generated by manual tracing of the infarct region showing restricted diffusion. Another VOI was generated by manual tracing of the region showing visually assessed reduction of CBF outside
of the infarct VOI.
The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was performed to
assess significance levels in time–activity curves and Patlak compartmental analyses from PET, comparing both SUV and macroparameters in the infarct region to the corresponding region in the
contralateral hemisphere after 90-minute M2CAO and after 60 minutes of reperfusion (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA). Any value of
P<0.05 was considered significant.

14.5±3.1 (group 2, n=4). The time interval between placement
of the microwire tip in the distal MCA and injection of [18F]
FDG in the tail vein was 8.2±2.4 minutes (groups 1 and 2, n=9).
First, we analyzed [18F]FDG-PET images summed >90 minutes of occlusion (n=9). By visual assessment, we detected
a markedly elevated [18F]FDG uptake in all animals (n=9) in
regions within the targeted MCA territory (Figure 1). Next,
we coregistered [18F]FDG-PET images with T2-weighted
MRI images from follow-up MRI (n=6). The regions showing elevated [18F]FDG uptake encompassed parietal and frontal brain regions including the ischemic region succumbing to
infarction in the parietal cortex defined by an increased signal
at T2-weighted MRI and a decrease in the apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC) at diffusion-weighted MRI 24 hours after
occlusion (Figure 1). Furthermore, we found elevated [18F]FDG
uptake in frontoparietal peri-infarct regions (Figure 1), showing
normal T2 signal and diffusion in MRI acquired at 24 hours.
The region showing an elevated [18F]FDG uptake was traced to
generate a VOI (ELEVVOI) for kinetic and compartmental analysis. The infarct detected by MRI and the region with elevated
[18F]FDG uptake outside the final infarct were traced to generate
VOIs for kinetic analysis (ISCHEMICVOI and PENUMBRAVOI).

Analysis of Whole Region With Elevated [18F]FDG
Uptake (ELEVVOI)

The time–activity curves from the VOI traced around the final
infarct showed that the SUV for the ELEVVOI had a slower rate

Results
One animal in group 1 did not show any infarct lesion detectable by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Two
animals developed large infarcts covering >2/3 of the MCA
territory during in-bore MRI. All 3 animals were excluded
from the study. Thus, the failure rate of this method for inducing focal IS was 12% in the present study.

respectively (Figure 2A). At the end of 90 minutes of PET registration during M2CAO, the SUV (mean±SD) for the ELEVVOI
was significantly higher (P=0.0039) compared with the corresponding contralateral cortex 1.660±0.3615 and 1.264±0.2060,
respectively (Figure 2A). At the end of 60 minutes of PET
registration during reperfusion, the SUV (mean±SD) for the
ELEVVOI was significantly higher (P=0.0117) compared with
the corresponding contralateral cortex 1.288±0.3040 and
1.154±0.2799, respectively (Figure 2B). Furthermore, Patlak
compartmental analysis of ELEVVOI revealed a significantly
increased (P=0.0039) net flux of [18F]FDG to the intracellular compartment during occlusion; Ki (mean±SEM) for the

metabolic lesion was 0.012±0.00067 versus 0.0063±0.00085
for corresponding contralateral cortex (Figure 2C). Our findings
indicate that the slower inflow of [18F]FDG during occlusion
causes a slighter slope of the time–activity curves, although the
collateral flow is sufficient to provide [18F]FDG. This results in
an elevated [18F]FDG uptake at later time points suggestive of
accelerated glycolysis. The smaller differences, although statistically significant, detected during reperfusion may reflect cessation of glycolysis because of infarction.

although not statistically significant (P=0.0625) compared
with the corresponding contralateral cortex 1.698±0.5431 and
1.455±0.3800, respectively (Figure 3B).
The SUV (mean±SD) for the PENUMBRAVOI was significantly higher (P=0.0313) at the end of occlusion compared
with the corresponding contralateral cortex 1.319±0.2899
and 1.130±0.1668, respectively (Figure 3C). At the end of

was higher although not statistically significant (P=0.0625)
compared with the corresponding contralateral cortex
1.364±0.5181 and 1.259±0.5018, respectively (Figure 3D).
[18F]FDG metabolism was thus markedly increased both in the
ischemic tissue gradually undergoing infarction (Figure 3A)
and in the surrounding penumbra (Figure 3D).
One group of animals was imaged with [18F]FDG at 24
hours after M2CAO (n=3). In all animals, a glucose hypometabolic region was detected in the targeted hemisphere.
This region corresponded to the infarct lesions verified by

2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining (Figure I in the
online-only Data Supplement).

MRI Scans of Acute Ischemia
To understand the hyperglycolytic response in stroke, we
assessed factors contributing to infarct development by MRI
during occlusion and reperfusion. Using the same time frame
and brain ischemia protocol as for PET, we investigated
changes in CBF by arterial spin labeling, restricted diffusion
of water by diffusion weighted imaging, and formation of lactate by MR spectroscopy.
Infarct Development
All animals in group 4 (n=6) showed cortical focal infarcts
defined by a decrease in the ADC reflecting flux of water
to the intracellular compartment (Figure 4B). A decrease in
ADC was detected at the first imaging time point 10 minutes
after M2CAO. The mean volume (mm3±SD) of the ADC
lesion at 10 and 150 minutes after M2CAO was 14.8±17.0
and 25.8±22.8, respectively. Thus, in this model, preserved

reperfusion. D, CBF measurements from ASL MRI in the ischemic VOI (black line) and in the peri-infarct VOI (grey dotted line; n=4).
The ischemic regions of interest (ROIs) were defined by the manifest infarcts, detected by diffusion MRI, and the peri-infarct ROIs were
defined by areas showing hypoperfusion on ASL images but without restricted diffusion. CBF values from the VOI over peri-infarct hypoperfused regions are significantly higher than the infarct VOI at 90 minutes (*P<0.024).

Cerebral Blood Flow
We measured CBF during M2 occlusion and reperfusion to
determine the impact of the stroke model on perfusion (group
4, n=4). The mean blood flow ratio±SD between the VOI
containing ischemic tissue undergoing infarction and a corresponding VOI in the contralateral cortex during occlusion
was 0.054±0.053 (30 minutes), 0.052±0.12 (60 minutes), and
0.056±0.034 (90 minutes; Figure 4D). In the VOI corresponding to peri-infarct regions showing hypoperfusion, the ratio
of blood flow±SD during reperfusion was 0.14±0.056 (30
minutes), 0.18±0.12 (60 minutes), and 0.22±0.053 (90 minutes; Figure 4D). The differences in blood flow between the
ischemic VOI and the peri-infarct VOI were statistically significant at 90 minutes of M2 occlusion (P=0.024; Figure 4D).
After reperfusion, blood flow in the ischemic VOI and periinfarct VOI increased to 0.60±0.33 (P=0.046) and 0.65±0.35
(P=0.0066), respectively (Figure 4D). The differences in
blood flow at 30 and 60 minutes after M2 occlusion were not
significant (Figure 4D).
Lactate Formation
The temporal evolution of lactate was measured in a VOI
placed in the center of the ADC lesion (group 4, n=4;
Figure 4A and 4B). Lactate levels were first elevated at
30 minutes after M2 occlusion and remained unchanged
throughout occlusion and reperfusion (Figure 4C). In a separate group of animals (n=3), the peri-infarct region was investigated by lactate MR spectroscopy. No lactate was detected
within the peri-infarct region during 90 minutes of occlusion,
whereas lactate was detected consistently within the ischemic region succumbing to infarction in the same animals
(Figure 4A and 4B). This data, in combination with [18F]FDG
PET data, show that increased glycolysis occurs under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

6, respectively) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry to
assess cellular DNA fragmentation and BBB injury. Stainings
were compared with the lesion on diffusion-weighted imaging
in the corresponding MRI images. Apoptosis defined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
stainings and morphological criteria corresponded directly to

the area of restricted diffusion. DNA-fragmentated cells in
general, detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP nick end labeling stainings, were detected within the
lesion defined by T2 MRI (Figure 5A). No terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling–positive cells
were detected outside of the T2 lesion (Figure 5B). Similarly,
immunoreactivity for Rat IgG was confined to the T2 lesion
(n=6; 24 hours; Figure 5C). Two subsets of animals were
intravenously injected with FITC–dextran (4 kDa) either
10 minutes (n=3) or 24 hours (n=4) postreperfusion after
M2CAO. In the 10-minute group, FITC–dextran extravasation was strictly confined to the infarct lesion. No FITC–
dextran extravasation was detected in the 24-hour group (data
not shown).

Discussion
Hypermetabolism of glucose in the ischemic brain has previously been detected by autoradiography and by [18F]FDGPET.1,3,6–9,11,22 The increase in glucose metabolism has been
reported to occur in peri-infarct brain regions in different
models of IS in the rat.7,9,11,22 In contrast to those studies, we
used a stroke model in which collateral circulation is preserved to a larger extent. We performed PET/MRI at early
time points, and we observed increased [18F]FDG uptake in
ischemic brain regions that undergo infarction as well as in
brain regions adjacent to the final infarction volume. These
findings are important because understanding the glucose
metabolism pathophysiology in the context of IS is fundamental for designing optimal treatment regimens.
In this study, the experimental protocol includes PET imaging at earlier time points after vessel occlusion, ie, the tissue
that later succumbs to infarction has not yet died at the time
of imaging. Furthermore, we apply an occlusion model20 for
focal cortical ischemia that does not impede collateral flow
to the same extent as other models. Using MRI, we found
significant blood flow differences between the VOI containing the final infarct and the VOI containing the region showing hypoperfusion outside of the ischemic region undergoing
infarction, suggesting the presence of an ischemic region and
a zone with reduced CBF supported by collateral flow. This
would better simulate the situation in human stroke and provide a larger and more differentiated penumbral zone with a
greater potential to increase glucose metabolism. Because this
occlusion model preserves collateral flow to a larger extent
compared with other models of stroke, the increased [18F]FDG

uptakes in tissue that later undergo infarction could demarcate
a penumbral zone, as infarct progression is slower under collateral flow.
Whether a presumed glucose hypermetabolism occurs
under aerobic or anaerobic conditions is a subject of controversy. Previous studies of the ischemic rim in rats under
conventional MCA occlusion suggest anaerobic as well as
aerobic glycolysis.6,11 In the present study, we used MR spectroscopy to assess lactate formation in the ischemic region
succumbing to infarction and in regions adjacent to the final
infarct. We detected lactate in the ischemic region in all animals but not in brain regions directly adjacent to the final
infarct in any animal. Considering that [18F]FDG uptake
was increased in both the ischemic and peri-infarct regions
at the same time points, we conclude that these increases
occur under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Although
accelerated glycolysis is the most plausible mechanism for
ischemia-related glucose hypermetabolism, other explanations have been proposed, as, for example, a change in affinity for [18F]FDG over glucose, ie, a changed lumped constant
in ischemic and hypoperfused tissues.23
In this study, we show evidence for BBB disruption by the
detection of rat IgG and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling–positive cells directly in regions
directly matching the T2 MRI lesion. This corroborates the
definition of ischemic and penumbral VOIs made using in
vivo MR and PET. Furthermore, we detected intravenously
administered FITC–dextran (4 kDa) within the infarct at 150
minutes after M2CAO but not at 24 hours, indicating BBB
disruption within the infarcted tissue itself at 150 minutes
after M2CAO with subsequent repair some time before 24
hours after reperfusion. A disruption of the BBB could theoretically change [18F]FDG kinetics by increased diffusion over
the BBB. However, this should equally affect the forward and
reverse capillary transport of [18F]FDG. In several studies,
2-DG localization has been shown to be independent of BBB
disruption in tumors, indicating that the net influx of 2-DG is
not increased because the reverse capillary transport is equally
increased.24,25 Our data support these observations.

Conclusions
We show that focal cortical stroke produces a significantly
increased uptake of [18F]FDG during occlusion in ischemic cortical regions succumbing to infarction and in cortical regions adjacent to the final infarct displaying reduction
of CBF. We show that lactate formation is detectable within
brain regions featuring increased [18F]FDG uptake, misery
perfusion, and restricted diffusion of water, although not in
regions displaying reduced CBF, demonstrating that increased
glycolysis occurs under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. These findings, in this model of focal ischemia with
preserved collateral circulation, strongly suggest that hypermetabolism of glucose occurs in the ischemic penumbra.
Hypermetabolism of glucose in this situation could well be a
reactive response to increased energy demands, thereby aiming for limitation of the lesion development. This knowledge
can be important for the interpretation and design of clinical
studies aiming for glucose control in the setting of acute IS.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Supplemental Methods
Animal preparation
All experiments were conducted according to the regulations of the Karolinska Institutet and
were approved by the local laboratory animal ethics committee. Male Sprague-Dawley rats
(355 - 450 g, Scanbur, Sollentuna, Sweden), were subjected to microwire occlusion of the M2
branch of the middle cerebral artery (M2CAO), as previously described (Group 1 - 6, n = 25)
1
. Briefly, a microwire is navigated by fluoroscopy from the medial tail artery to a microwire
tip position in the M2 branch of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Imaging studies and postmortem analyses were performed as shown in Table 1. Animals were anesthetized using 2%
isoflurane (Virbac, Carros Cedex, France) blended with air - O2 (7:3) during surgery and
imaging. In Group 2, blood glucose levels were assessed immediately before- and 60 min
after retraction of the microwire by analyzing tail artery blood samples with a glucometer
(HemoCue 210+/201RT, HemoCue, Ängelholm, Sweden).
PET
Imaging protocol
In vivo PET investigations were performed on a Focus 120 (CTI Concorde Microsystems,
Knoxville, USA) microPET scanner. Animals in groups 1 and 2 were placed in the PET
scanner with the brain in the field of view within five min after placement of the microwire in
the MCA. [18F]FDG, administered via the tail vein (20-40 MBq, 500 µL), was an aliquot
obtained from daily productions for clinical PET at the Karolinska University Hospital and
had passed all quality requirements for administrations in humans. Data were collected
continuously during 90 min from the time of injection. Next, the microwire was retracted and
a second injection of [18F]FDG was administered via the tail vein (20-40 MBq, 500 µL)
followed by data collection every second during 60 min from the time of reperfusion
histogrammed as the 90 min scan but 9 frames x 300 s and physical half-life compensation
following the original injected dose. Animals in Group 2 also underwent a follow-up MRI 24
h after M2CAO. Animals in Group 3 were placed in the PET scanner with the brain in the
field of view 24 h after 90 min M2CAO. Data were acquired in list mode and were corrected
for random coincidence, dead time and decay and histogrammed 6 frames x 10 s, 10 frames x
60 s and 15 frames x 300 s. Images were reconstructed by standard 2D filtered back
projection using a ramp filter.
Quantification method
In order to estimate the radiotracer uptake, a macro parameter analysis method was used in
addition to time-activity curves of the standard uptake values (SUV) 2. Since [18F]FDG is
trapped irreversibly intracellularly in tissues low in dephosphatases, the Patlak data-driven
method was chosen 3. A data-driven kinetic model does not assume a specific compartment
set-up a priori. A macro parameter requires a mathematical input function, in this case, from a
volume of interest (VOI) with a pre-determined size was traced over the innominate artery
using a PET image summed during the first five min of data collection. The Patlak method
gives the Ki value, the so-called influx constant as a quantification of the net uptake of the
radiotracer. The VOIs were chosen using a dual-modality approach, where both a functional
(PET) and an anatomical (MRI, 9.4T) image were obtained for some animals (n = 6).

MRI
Imaging protocol
The MRI experiments were conducted using a horizontal 9.4 T magnet (Varian, Yarnton, UK)
equipped with a 12 cm inner diameter gradient system with maximum gradient strength of
600 mT/m. A birdcage resonator was used for excitation (Rapid Biomedical GmbH,
Würzburg-Rimpar, Germany) and a ‘rat head’ 4-channel phased array surface coil (Rapid
Biomedical GmbH, Würzburg-Rimpar, Germany) served as the receiving coil. For perfusion
measurement, an arterial spin labeling surface coil (Rapid Biomedical GmbH) was
additionally introduced and placed 2 cm away from the head coil underneath the neck area.
Within 5 min after placement of the microwire in the M2 branch of the MCA, animals in
Groups 4 and 5 were placed in the MRI scanner. The physiological state of the anaesthetized
rats was monitored and maintained during scanning (SA-instruments, Stony Brook, NY,
USA). Imaging data were collected during 90 min. Next, the microwire was retracted
followed by data collection for an additional 60 min.
T2 and Diffusion tensor imaging
Diffusion tensor images were acquired using multi-slice three-shot spin-echo echo-planar
imaging (EPI) sequence in transverse plane (14 slices of 1mm thickness) with repetition time
(TR) 3 s, echo time (TE) 25 ms, field of view 32 × 32 mm2, matrix size 96 × 96, in-plane
resolution of 33 × 33 µm, diffusion gradient duration (Δ) 2.3 ms and diffusion gradient
separation (δ) 6.5 ms. Diffusion sensitizing gradients were applied along 12 directions with
two diffusion sensitizing factors b = 0 and 1000 s/mm2.
Arterial spin labeling
Perfusion measurements were performed using three-shot gradient EPI with field of view 32
× 32 mm2, matrix size 96 × 96, TR 6.15 s, TE 10.5 ms and 14 slices of 1 mm thickness with
no gap in between. Continuous arterial spin labeling was accomplished by applying an offresonance radio frequency (RF) power to the arterial spin labeling (ASL) coil in the presence
of a 1 Gauss/cm gradient during TR. The labeling plane was located 2.4 cm upstream from
the imaging slice package and a transit time (TI) of 2 ms was assigned to the labeled blood
moving away from the tagging plane. A pair of tagged and control images were acquired for
each slice. To acquire the control image, the tag position was reversed by switching the sign
of the labeling offset-frequency, resulting in the tagging plane being moved downstream to
the imaging plane.
Spectroscopy
1
H MRI spectra were acquired using point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence from a
volume of interest (VOI) (2.5×1.7×2.5 mm3). Two separate VOIs were centered in the area
displaying restricted diffusion and in the peri-infarct region on the diffusion tensor images.
The water suppressed spectrum was acquired with TR 3s, a total TE 15.66 ms, 3 ppm offset
from water signal, spectral width 8013Hz, 4096 complex data points and 32 scans, with a total
acquisition time of 1.42 min. The water signal was suppressed with variable power RF pulses
and optimized relaxation delays (VAPOR). A water reference scan was recorded per each
water-suppressed spectrum for quantification and eddy current compensation purposes. The
gradient polarity was reversed to compensate for the chemical shift displacement artifacts due
to spectral lipid contamination.

Immunohistochemistry
The animals in groups 1-3 were sacrificed at 24 h after MCAO and animals in group 4 were
sacrificed 48-96 h after M2CAO. Animals in group 6 were sacrificed 10 min after
reperfusion, following the 90 min of M2CAO. The brains from animals in group 1 and 3 were
removed immediately after sacrifice. Six coronal 2 mm cryosections were taken throughout
the brain and immersed in a 2 % solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in
normal saline at 37°C for 30 min, after which the sections were fixed in 10 % phosphate
buffered formalin for photography. The brains from animals in groups 2,4 and 6 were
removed and snap frozen in isopentane-dry ice. The animals in groups 2 and 6 were injected
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (4kDa, Sigma-Aldrich; 500 ml of 50mg/ml) in
phosphate-buffered saline via the tail vein immediately after reperfusion (group 6, n = 3) and
after 24h (group 2, n=4). The animals were sacrificed 15 min after the injection. Coronal 14
µm cryosections were taken at -15°C throughout the infarct and peri-infarct regions using a
Leica cryostat (CM3000, Leica Instruments GmbH, Nussloch, Germany). The sections were
thaw mounted and stored at -20°C prior to use.
To visualize apoptotic staining, the ApopTag Fluorescein or ApopTag Red Detection kits
were used following the protocol suggested in the kit. Briefly, sections were placed in fresh
4% paraformaldehyde solution, post-fixed in ethanol:acetic acid solution and incubated in
TdT solution for one hour at 37oC. Stop/wash buffer was added and the slides were finally
incubated with Anti-Digoxigenin Conjugate solution for 30min. Then rabbit anti-Glut1
primary antibody (Atlas Antibodies) diluted 1/1000 in 0.3% TX-100, 0.1% NaN3 in
phosphate buffered saline was added. Following an overnight incubation, sections were
washed in Tris-HCl buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% tween, blocked (Perkin Elmer)
and incubated in blocking buffer containing anti-rabbit and anti-rat secondary antibodies
(1/200, Jackson) followed by several washes in Tris-HCl buffered saline containing 0.5%
tween. All sections were counterstained with the nuclear marker Hoechst (1/5,000) and
mounted with polyvinyl alcohol/glycerol containing 2.5% DABCO (Sigma).
Fluorescence microscope images were acquired on a Vslide slide scanning microscope
(MetaSystems, Alltlussheim, Germany) equipped with a CoolCube 1 camera (12 bit greyscale), 2.5x, 5x, 10x and 20x objectives and filter sets for DAPI (EX350/50 - EM470/40),
FITC (EX493/16 – EM527/30), Cy3 (EX546/10 – EM580/30), Cy3.5 (EX581/10 –
EM617/40) and Cy5 (EX630/20 – 647/long pass). Whole microscope slides were scanned at
2.5x and tissue was detected based on the Hoechst 33342 signal. After generating a position
map all tissue covered areas were scanned using 20x primary objective. Individual field of
view images were stitched to generate a large 4-channel fluorescence image of the entire
specimen with microscopic resolution.
Image and Statistical analysis
PET data were processed with MicroPET manager and evaluated using the Inveon Research
Workplace (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) software. MRI data were processed
with VnmrJ software (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and evaluated using
ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Maryland, USA). MRI and PET images from animals
in group 1 (n = 6) were co-registered using the Inveon Research Workplace and exported to
ImageJ for analysis. ROIs were manually traced for the brain regions showing altered
metabolism and infarct.
The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was performed to assess significance levels in
time activity curves and Patlak compartmental analyses from PET, comparing both SUV and
macro parameters in the infarct region to the corresponding region in the contralateral

hemisphere at 90 min of imaging (GraphPad Prism, San Diego, CA, USA). Any value of p <
0.05 was considered significant.
