Abstract Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
biosynthetic enzyme. It has been shown to be neuroprotective against neonatal excitotoxicity-induced brain injury, but
its role in ischemic stroke is unclear. In this study, the role of
NMNAT1 in oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced
primary cultured neuronal cell injury and mouse middle
cerebral artery occlusion-induced cerebral ischemic injury
and its regulation on AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
activation were evaluated. The results showed that
NMNAT1 overexpression reduced cell death and apoptosis
both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, NMNAT1 knockdown
exacerbated cell death and apoptosis. Furthermore,
NMNAT1 overexpression regulated neuron survival via
AMPK activation, as NMNAT1 overexpression enhanced
AMPK activity in OGD-treated cortical neurons, and AMPK
inhibitor blocked LV-NMNAT1-induced neuroprotection in
OGD-treated cortical neurons. In addition, NMNAT1 overexpression could reduce brain infarction size and improve
behavioral outcomes in mice with ischemic stroke. These
results suggested that up-regulation of NMNAT1 could induce neuroprotection against ischemic injury through

Introduction
It is known that ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes
of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke-induced neuronal death involve complex cellular biochemical events that ultimately
lead to the neuronal damage, for instance, excitotoxicity,
calcium dysregulation, oxidative and nitrosative stress,
cortical spreading depolarizations, inflammation, necrosis
and apoptosis [1]. The defense to impaired cerebral energy
metabolism may be an important factor contribute to the
survival of cells under cerebral ischemia [2, 3]. Therefore,
the elucidation of the defense mechanisms against stroke
injury is considered important for the development of novel
therapeutic targets for stroke treatment.
Nicotinamide
mononucleotide
adenylyltransferase
(NMNAT) is the essential enzyme catalyzing nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD?) synthesis. Three mammalian
NMNAT isoforms have been identified and they have distinct
subcellular localizations. NMNAT1 is localized to the nucleus, whereas NMNAT2 and -3 are present in the Golgi and
mitochondria, respectively [4]. Recent studies have revealed
an essential neuronal maintenance and protective function for
NMNATs [5]. NMNAT1 is considered a potential target for
the development of new treatment strategies for several
pathological conditions because of its significant role in
maintaining the equilibrium of reductive equivalents in cells
[6]. NMNAT1 possesses stress-responsive properties, and its

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:1102–1110

overexpression protects neuronal cell bodies and processes
against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in cultured cortical
neurons [7]. These reports indicate that NMNAT1 may be an
endogenous protector, protecting neuronal cells from ischemic injury. But the role of NMNAT1 in ischemic stroke is
hitherto undefined.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a trimetric
enzyme comprising a catalytic a-subunit and regulatory band c-subunits [8]. A series of pathological conditions such
as glucose deprivation, ischemia, starvation and oxidative
stress increase AMPK activity [9]. AMPK activation is a
protective response that occurs after injury. It has been
demonstrated that increasing AMPK activity in neurons
protects neurons from various injury [10]. However, data
have been also published showing that inhibition of AMPK
protects cells against neurotoxic effect of cerebral ischemia
[11]. The discrepancies may be attributed to various
parameters such as differences in models, cerebral regions
studies, as well as time duration, and etc. [12, 13].
In the present study, we investigated the role and
mechanism of NMNAT1 in the regulation of neural ischemic injuries by using cultured cortical neurons with
oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) of ischemic injury
in vitro and mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke in vivo. Our results suggested that up-regulation of NMNAT1 alleviates ischemic
injury through AMPK activation and indicated that
NMNAT1 is a new therapeutic target for ischemic stroke.

Methods
Animals and Surgery
Adult (8–10 weeks old), male C57BL/6 J mice (18–22 g)
purchased from Experimental Animal Center of Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences, PR China were housed in
temperature controlled rooms with 12 h light/dark cycles. All
experiments with animals were conducted according to our
institutional guidelines for animal care and were consistent
with the NIH guide for the use of experimental animals.
Before performing the mouse MCAO model of ischemic
stroke, lentiviral vectors (LV) were stereotaxically injected
into the cortex as previous report [14, 15]. Briefly, mice
were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg
i.p.) and fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus. Each mouse was
subjected to three cortical injections in the right hemisphere. Each point was injected with 0.7 ll of lentivirus
suspension containing 1 9 109 TU/ml (GeneChem,
Shanghai, RP China) at a rate of 0.2 ll/min. Mice were
subjected to MCAO 5 days after injection of LV.
The mouse MCAO model of ischemic stroke was conducted as described before [16–18]. Briefly, after

1103

anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg i.p.), the
right common carotid artery and ipsilateral external carotid
artery were exposed and focal cerebral ischemia was produced by 1 h of MCAO with a 6–0 surgical nylon monofilament followed by 24 h of reperfusion.
Measurements of Neurological Deficits and Infarct
Volume
Mice neurological deficits were assessed at 24 h after
MCAO according to neurological disability status scale
(NDSS) reported by Rodriguez et al. [19]. NDSS has 10
progressive steps beyond 0 (normal), extending to status 10
(death). In brief, the six major steps indicate: 0 for no
neurological dysfunction; 2 corresponds to slight decrease
in mobility and the presence of passivity; 4 corresponds to
moderate neurological dysfunction and including additional alterations, such as hunched back, flattened posture,
lateralized posture, moderate hypomobility, ataxic gait,
decreased body tone and slight motor incoordination and
muscular strength; 6 represents more handicapped animals
but still able to walk, with more marked hypomobility,
jerks and/or convulsions, tremor, circling, forelimb flexion
and moderate motor incoordination; 8 represents respiratory distress, and total incapacity to move/coordinate. If the
criteria for the accurate grade were not met, the most appropriate number was utilized: 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9.
Mice were killed at 24 h after MCAO, and the brain was
quickly removed and sliced into 1.0 mm thickness coronal
sections. Sections were incubated for 15 min in a solution
of 0.5 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazoliumchloride (TTC) (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37 °C, and then the slices
were scanned into a computer. The images of stained slices
were analyzed using Image Pro Plus1 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). The infarct volume was calculated using a derived equation [20]:
ðContralateral hemisphere volume
 non-infarct ipsilateral hemisphere volumeÞ
=contralateral hemisphere volume  100%:
Preparation of Compound C
Compound C was dissolved in DMSO and vehicle
(DMSO) or Compound C was added into the culture
medium at 3 h before OGD. The concentration of Compound C (10 lM) was chosen based on previous study
from Wang et al. [21].
Primary Cortical Neurons Culture and Treatment
Primary cortical neurons were prepared from postnatal day 1
C57BL/6 J mice and seeded onto plates at a density of

123

1104

5 9 105 cells per cm2. Primary cortical neurons were cultured
in neurobasal medium (Gibco Inc., Grand Island, USA), with
2 % B27 supplement (Gibco Inc., Grand Island, USA) and
transferred into a 37 °C anaerobic chamber (Thermo Electron
LED GmbH, Langenselbold, Germany) in normoxic condition (5 % CO2, 21 % O2 and 74 % N2). The culture medium
was replaced in half by fresh medium every 3 days.
Oxygen–glucose deprivation treatment was performed on
primary cortical neurons to mimic ischemic-like conditions
in vitro. The culture medium was replaced with glucose-free
DMEM (Gibco Inc.). Then, primary cortical neurons were
placed in the 37 °C hypoxic chamber (5 % CO2, 1 % O2 and
94 % N2) for 1 h. After OGD exposure, the neurons were
maintained in growth culture containing glucose under
normoxic condition for reoxygenation. Control group was
not deprived of oxygen and glucose and always kept in
norm-oxygenated culture containing glucose.

(1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, USA), b-actin antibody (Sigma) and corresponding secondary antibodies
(Stressgen Biotechnologies Corporation, Victoria, BC,
Canada). The Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) kit
(GE Healthcare, UK) was used to detect the signals.

TUNEL Staining

Effect of NMNAT1 on OGD-Induced Ischemic
Injury in Cultured Cortical Neurons

Apoptosis was assessed by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining kit (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit,
TMR red, Roche) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, fix cell samples with a freshly fixation solution for
1 h and then rinse slides with PBS. Cells were incubated in
permeabilisation solution for 2 min and then incubated with
TUNEL reaction mixture in humidified atmosphere for 1 h
at 37 °C in the dark. DAPI was used to visualize the neural
nuclei. Images were acquired by a fluorescence microscope
system (Leica DM4000B, Germany).
Lentiviral Transduction and Cell Viability
Assessment
Then, primary cortical neurons were infected with LVNMNAT1, LV-GFP, LV-sh-NMNAT1 or LV-sh-scramble
(GeneChem, Shanghai, PR China) at a multiplicity of infection
of 20 after 6 days according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Forty-eight h after transfection, cortical neurons subjected to
1 h OGD and 24 h reoxygenation. The extent cultured cortical
neuron death was assessed by using the CytoTox 96Ò nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay (LDH; Promega Cor, Madison,
WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Western Blot Analysis
Total protein was extracted from the brain or cultured
cortical neurons as described previously [22, 23]. Antibodies in this study were anti-NMNAT1 (1:500; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, USA), anti-AMPKa (1:1000; Cell
Signaling Technology, USA), anti-pAMPKa (Thr172)
(1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, USA), anti-Caspase-3

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 software (IBM, USA). Values are expressed as mean ± SEM.
Differences between groups were calculated using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by all pairwise
multiple comparison procedures using Bonferroni’s test.
P \ 0.05 was defined as significant.

Results

To assess the functional significance of NMNAT1 in
regulating OGD-induced neuronal cell death, the cultured
cortical neurons were infected with lentiviral vectors encoding NMNAT1 or short hairpin RNA targeting NMNAT1.
As shown in Fig. 1a, b, NMNAT1 expression levels were
increased in cortical neurons after 48 h transfection of LVNMNAT1 and decreased in that of sh-NMNAT1. OGD-induced primary neuronal cell death was simultaneously assayed by LDH method. The results clearly showed that
treatment with sh-NMNAT1 increased OGD-induced neuronal cells death, whereas the LV-NMNAT1 effectively
reduced OGD-induced primary neuronal cell death compared to control group in 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation
condition (Fig. 1c). These data indicated that decreased
NMNAT1 levels worsen ischemia-like injury, while increased NMNAT1 levels mitigate ischemia-like injury.
To determine whether NMNAT1 could affect OGDinduced cortical neurons apoptosis in vitro, we examined
the OGD-induced cortical neurons apoptosis by TUNEL
staining. As shown in Fig. 1d, e, sh-NMNAT1 could significantly enhance 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation-induced
cortical neurons apoptosis compared with OGD-treated
control, whereas LV-NMNAT1 attenuated cortical neurons
apoptosis after 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation. These results
showed that up-regulation of NMNAT1 reduced OGDinduced cortical neurons death as well as apoptosis in vitro.
Up-Regulation of NMNAT1 Ameliorated OGDInduced Ischemic Injury via AMPK Activation

NMNAT1 could reduce OGD-induced cultured cortical

that the NMNAT1 levels could be up- and down-regulated in LVNMNAT1 and sh-NMNAT1 transfected cortical neurons after 1 h

results indicated that sh-NMNAT1 aggravated cell apoptosis under
OGD conditions. In contrast, LV-NMNAT1 could attenuate cell
apoptosis after OGD treatment. e Representative microscopic images

neurons death. We next studied the mechanism by which
NMNAT1 reduced the OGD-induced cell death in vitro.
AMPK, which is activated via phosphorylation, plays an

important role in the neuroprotection against ischemic
stroke. Therefore, we sought to determine whether AMPK
activation contributing to NMNAT1 protection against

123

1106

OGD-induced ischemic injury. We detected AMPK and
p-AMPK expression levels by Western blot. AMPK was
significantly activated by OGD and NMNAT1 over-expression further increased phosphorylation of AMPK in
cultured cortical neurons after 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation (Fig. 2a, b). To further explore the contributory role of
AMPK in the effect of NMNAT1 on OGD-induced cortical
neurons death, we used Compound C, a chemical inhibitor
of AMPK. Compound C could abolish LV-NMNAT1mediated neuroprotection against OGD-induced cortical
neurons injury (Fig. 2e), and inhibit OGD-induced
p-AMPK up-regulation in vitro (Fig. 2c, d). These results
indicated that NMNAT1 overexpression-induced AMPK
activation is a novel signal pathway for rescuing neurons
from death.
Effect of NMNAT1 on MCAO-Induced Ischemic
Injury in Mice
To evaluate the biological role of NMNAT1 in the ischemic brain damage in vivo, we used stereotaxic injection
of LV-NMNAT1 or LV-GFP into mouse cortex. All samples were taken from the peri-infarct region of mice at 24 h
after 1 h MCAO. As shown in Fig. 3a, b, NMNAT1 and
p-AMPK levels in MCAO ? LV-NMNAT1 group were
significantly increased compared with MCAO group. In
addition, NMNAT1 and p-AMPK levels were up-regulated
compared with sham group. We analyzed the effect of LVNMNAT1 on cleaved Caspase-3 protein level. Western
blot analysis showed that LV-NMNAT1 significantly reduced the cleaved Caspase-3 (activation) levels in cerebral
ischemic cortex of mice at 24 h after 1 h MCAO (Fig. 3d,
e). Further, LV-NMNAT1 improved neurological deficit of
mice compared with MCAO groups (Fig. 3f).
Lastly, we sought to determine whether up-regulation of
NMNAT1 could reduce neural injury after ischemia/reperfusion. To test this, we measured the effect of LV-NMNAT1
on the brain infarct volume. Representive brain slices illustrated tissue infarction in the mice with sham, MCAO,
MCAO ? LV-GFP or MCAO ? LV-NMNAT1 (Fig. 4a,
b). The quantitative data showed that the infarction volume
increased in MCAO group compared with sham group, and
the infarction volume was significantly reduced in MCAO
with LV-NMNAT1 treatment. These results above clearly
demonstrated that up-regulation of cerebral NMNAT1 provides neuroprotection against ischemia in vivo.

Discussion
The major finding of the study is that up-regulation of
NMNAT1 could induce neuroprotection against ischemic
injury in mice with cerebral MCAO/reperfusion injury and

123

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:1102–1110

in cultured cortical neurons subjected to OGD/reoxygenation, suggesting NMNAT1 as a potential candidate for
therapeutic target in ischemic stroke. Further studies revealed that the mechanisms of NMNAT1 protection
against ischemic injury may involve up-regulation of
AMPK activity.
Neuronal cell death is a critical part of stroke pathophysiology. However, in brain damage neuronal cell death
was classically viewed to occur by autophagy, apoptosis,
and necrosis. Cell apoptosis is a physiological process of
programmed cell death, which is associated with development and in response to stress to help maintain homeostasis. In our study, we chose LDH method to assess cell
death rate and TUNEL assay to detect cell death, which is
not truly specific test for apoptosis, including apoptotic cell
death, but also programmed necrotic cell death. We also
detected cleaved Caspase-3 protein level by western blot,
which is a major indicator for cell apoptosis.
NMNAT1, first characterized as essential enzyme catalyzing NAD? synthesis, has important neuronal maintenance function. Overexpression of NMNAT1 robustly
protects axons in the PNS [24–26]. NMNAT is also transcriptionally regulated during various stress conditions including heat shock and hypoxia through heat shock factor
(HSF) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF1a) [27].
However, the function of NMNAT1 has been still unknown in cerebral ischemic injury. In this study, we found
that down-regulation of NMNAT1 aggravated neuronal
cell death, whereas up-regulation of NMNAT1 inhibited
neuronal cell death after 1 h OGD/24 h reoxygenation.
Furthermore, we infused LV-NMNAT1 into the cerebral
cortex of mice to up-regulate NMNAT1. LV-NMNAT1
treatment significantly attenuated brain infarction size and
improved neurological outcomes of mice in transient
MCAO model of ischemic stroke. Of note, our results
indicated that apoptosis was decreased in OGD-induced
cortical neurons and in the ischemic stroke models of
MCAO mice transfected with LV-NMNAT1. These data
suggest that NMNAT1 might inhibit cell apoptosis by
targeting some proteins in cerebral ischemic injury.
AMP-activated protein kinase is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, which is activated via
phosphorylation and is a primary sensor of the cellular
energy reserve [10]. Activation of AMPK was able to increase glucose uptake and cellular energy for metabolism
[28–31]. AMPK is activated in brain tissue and plays critical protective role in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury
[32–35]. Therefore, we speculated that there might be some
interaction between NMNAT1 and AMPK. As expected,
we found that upon MCAO/reperfusion conditions, the
AMPK phosphorylation was increased in cortical neurons
and further enhanced in LV-NMNAT1 treated group. Besides, inhibition of AMPK by Compound C could block

NMNAT1-mediated neuroprotection against OGD-induced

activation plays a critical role in NMNAT1-evoked neuron
survival. A recent study reports that nicotinamide

phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) overexpression by
LV-NAMPT elevates NAD? level and activates AMPK
phosphorylation via SIRT1 in OGD neurons [21]. Given
that NAMPT and NMNAT1 are in the NAD?-synthesis

pathway, they may share similar mechanism in protection
against ischemic stroke. And it has been reported that
NMNAT1 could regulate the functions of NAD?-dependent enzymes such as the protein deacetylase SIRT1 [36].
So we hypothesized that NMNAT1 may affect AMPK
activation through regulating NAD?-dependent SIRT1
activity. However, further research is required to clarify the
detail mechanism underlying the effect of NMNAT1 on
AMPK activation. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) activation plays an important role in neuronal death on
ischemic stress through NAD? depletion, and supplementation of NAD? is neuroprotective and prevents PARP-1mediated cell death in vitro [37, 38]. NMNAT-1 not only
provides the substrate but also regulates PARP-1 activity,
depending on its state of phosphorylation [39]. The role of
PARP-1 in NMNAT1-induced neuroprotection against ischemic injury should be observed in the future
experiments.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that up-regulated
NMNAT1 could prevent neural ischemia injury in vitro
and in vivo through AMPK activation, providing new insights into endogenous defense mechanisms in ischemic
stroke.
