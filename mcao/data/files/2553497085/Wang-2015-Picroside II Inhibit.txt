Abstract The objective of this study is to explore the neuroprotective effect and mechanism of picroside II on ERK1/2COX2 signal transduction pathway after cerebral ischemic
injury in rats. Focal cerebral ischemic models were established
by inserting monofilament threads into the middle cerebral
artery in 200 Wistar rats. Twenty four rats were randomly
selected into control group, while the other rats were randomly
divided into six groups: model group, picroside group, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with picroside group, U0126 with
picroside group, LPS group, and U0126 group with each
group containing three subgroups with ischemia at 6, 12,
and 24 h. Neurobehavioral function in the rats was evaluated
by modified neurological severity score points (mNSS) test;
structure of neurons was observed using hematoxylin-eosin
(HE) staining; apoptotic cells were counted using terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay; expressions of phosphorylated mitogen/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinas1/2 (pMEK1/2),
phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein
kinase1/2 (pERK1/2), and cyclooxygenase (COX2) in the
cortex were determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and Western blot (WB); and real-time PCR was used to determine the level of COX2 mRNA. The neurological behavioral
malfunction appeared in all rats with middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO). In the model group, neuron damage was
extensive, while the neurobehavioral function score, apoptotic

cell index, expression of pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, and COX2 and
the level of COX2 mRNA increased significantly when compared to the control group. The peak COX2 mRNA level was
in ischemia 12 h, prior to the peak in COX2 protein expression. In the picroside and U0126 groups, the neurological
behavioral function was improved, and the number of apoptotic cells and the expression of pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, and
COX2 decreased significantly when compared to the model
group. In the LPS with picroside group, at ischemia 6 h neuron
damage was extensive, and pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, and COX2
expression were much higher than in the model group. But at
ischemia 12 and 24 h, the expression of pMEK1/2, pERK1/2,
and COX2 decreased slightly, and the neurobehavioral function also improved slightly. In LPS group, neuron damage was
extensive, pMEK1/2, pERK1/2, and COX2 expression was
still at a high level, and COX2 mRNA peak arrived at ischemic 12 h. Picroside II downregulates COX2 expression after
MCAO by inhibiting MEK-ERK1/2 in rats to protect neurons
from apoptosis and inflammation.

Introduction
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signal pathway is one of the most important mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways,
which is a highly conserved three-tiered pathway. Binding of
some growth factors or extracellular stimuli to membrane receptors induces the dissociation of GDP from Ras and allows
the formation of an activated GTP-Ras complex. The activated Ras in turn leads to the activation of Raf (Bokemeyer et al.
1996). After activation, the C terminal catalytic region of Raf
combines with MEK1/2 to allow phosphorylation of Ser-xxx-

336

Ser/Thr of the ςΙΙ kinase subdomain and activates MEK1/2.
Activated MEK1/2 has dual-specificity kinases that catalyze
the phosphorylation of Tyr204/187 and Thr202/185 in ERK1/
2 to activate ERK1/2 to regulate a number of physiological
and pathological processes including cell proliferation, division, and differentiation (Jr 2012). It was shown that phosphor-ERK1/2 expression in the ischemic core and penumbra
in mice brains increased following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (Wang et al. 2004a). Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses demonstrated that pre-treatment
with U0126 (a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2) significantly inhibited phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 expression 1–2 h after MCAO. In addition, U0126 significantly
decreased the brain infarct volume when compared to the
control group. Inhibition of ERK1/2 also inhibited phosphorylation of the downstream kinase Elk-1 and further reduced
the transcription of IL-1β mRNA. These results suggest that
activation of the ERK1/2 signal pathway could induce the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, following cerebral ischemia,
which exacerbates ischemic brain injury. However, it is uncertain how ERK1/2 pathway activation mediates the ischemic
cerebral injury.
Cyclooxygenase (COX) has two different catalytic functions: cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities (Smith et al.
1996, 2000), which catalyze the conversion of arachidonic
acid (AA) to prostaglandin (PG). COX2 is an isozyme of
COX and is mainly responsible for pathological processes
such as inflammatory reaction, and its expression is upregulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and tumor factors (Bauer et al. 1997;
Minghetti et al. 1997; Levi et al. 1998; Wang et al. 2004b). A
number of studies have shed light into the action mechanism
of COX in MCAO. Yolanda et al. (Collaço-Moraes et al.
1996) showed that COX2 mRNA levels significantly increased in the Bcore^ and Bpenumbra^ regions of the cerebral
cortex between 4 and 24 h after MCAO and that MK-801,
which is an inhibitor of NMDA, could inhibit such COX2
mRNA induction. More importantly, the increase in COX2
mRNA levels in the cortex at 4 h after MCAO correlated well
with the severity of brain damage detected at 24 h after
MCAO. Zhao et al. demonstrated that pioglitazone offers neuroprotection by activating cerebral peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors gamma (PPARγ) thereby suppressing neuronal COX2 overexpression after focal cerebral ischemia in
rats (Zhao Y1 et al. 2006). Other studies showed that LPS and
IL-1β could upregulate COX2 expression by activating
ERK1/2 pathway, which catalyzes PGE2 production thereby
aggravating inflammatory response. On the other hand, inhibitors of MEK1/2 such as PD98059 and U0126 reduced such
inflammatory response by attenuating COX2 overexpression
(Hwang et al. 1997; Guan et al. 1998).
A traditional Chinese medicine used for common cold
is picrorhiza, which is obtained from Scrophulariaceae, a

perennial herb. The most abundant component in
picrorhiza is picroside II. In previous studies, we showed
that picroside II attenuated ultra-structure changes in neurons in the cortex, reduced neuronal apoptosis, decreased
cerebral infarct volume, and recovered the neurobehavioral malfunction in rats with cerebral ischemia. These findings suggest that picroside II could offer neuroprotection
by its ability to inhibit inflammation, oxidation, and apoptosis (Li et al. 2010a, b; Guo et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2011;
Pei et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2014). However, the mechanisms underlying these actions are not known. Therefore,
in this study we determined the role of ERK1/2-COX2
pathway in cerebral ischemic injury. Particularly, we investigated whether ERK1/2 pathway inhibited or promoted cerebral ischemic injury and whether picroside II
protected the nervous system from cerebral ischemia by
regulating MEK-ERK1/2-COX2 signal pathway.

Animal Model of MCAO
All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the
local legislation for ethical experimentation on animals and
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. In total,
200 healthy adult male Wistar rats, SPF grade, weight 220–
250 g, were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center
of Qingdao Drug Inspection Institute (SCXK (LU)
20100010). The animals were housed for 1 week at 25±
2 °C and allowed free access to food and water with natural
illumination. For the control group, 24 rats were randomly
selected, and the remaining 176 rats were subjected to experimental MCAO by intraluminal insertion of a monofilament
suture from the left external-internal carotid artery (Nagasawa
and Kogure 1989). All rats fasted for 12 h pre-operation, anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10 % chloral hydrate
(3 ml/kg), and then were fixed in the supine position to conduct aseptic operation. Two hours (2 h) after MCAO surgery,
neurological functions of rats were evaluated using the modified neurological severity score (mNSS) test (Chen et al.
2001). Rats with a mNSS score ranging from 7 to 12 were
considered as successful models, while rats (32 rats) that died
or did not meet this standard were removed from the study. We
obtained 144 successful models, and they were randomly divided into the following groups: model, picroside, LPS with
picroside, U0126 with picroside, and LPS and U0126 groups.
Each group also had the following subgroups: ischemia at 6,
12, and 24 h with eight rats in each subgroup. The rats in the
control group underwent the same surgical procedure without
the insertion of a monofilament into the MCA.

intraperitoneal injection 2 h after MCAO. The concentration
of LPS was 20 mg/kg.
U0126 Group (n = 24) The ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor,
U0126-EtOH, was diluted in 1 % sodium chloride containing
10 % DMSO and administered into rats by intraperitoneal
injection 2 h after MCAO. The dosage of both U0126-EtOH
was 20 mg/kg.
Control and Model Groups (n=24) The rats in both groups
were administered the same amounts of sodium chloride solution 2 h after the operation.
Collection of Specimen
The mNSS test was used to evaluate the neurobehavioral
function of each rat before and after treatment, and then, all
rats were used for specimen collection.
Pathological Section At a given time after treatment, four rats
from each subgroup were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10 % chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg) and reperfused
with 200 ml of 4 % formaldehyde from the heart into the aorta.
Then, the whole brain was removed from each rat. Brain tissue
sections behind the optic chiasma were cut to 5-mm thickness
and fixed in 4 % formaldehyde for 2 h. Next, the tissues were
soaked in distilled water for 4 h, dehydrated in increasing
concentrations of alcohol, hyalinized using dimethylbenzene,
embedded in paraffin, sectioned in 5-μm thickness, mounted
on glass slides prepared with poly-l-lysine, and stored at 4 °C
until further use.

Intervention
Treatment Group (n=24) Picroside II was diluted in 1 %
sodium chloride and administered into rats at the concentration of 20 mg/kg picroside II (Namura et al. 2001) by peritoneal injection 2 h after MCAO.
LPS with Picroside Group (n=24) The inflammation inducer, LPS, was diluted in 1 % sodium chloride and administered
into rats along with picroside II by intraperitoneal injection 2 h
after MCAO. The concentration of both LPS and picroside II
was 20 mg/kg.
U0126 with Picroside Group (n=24) The ERK1/2 pathway
inhibitor, U0126-EtOH, was diluted in 1 % sodium chloride
containing 10 % DMSO and administered into rats along with
picroside by intraperitoneal injection 2 h after MCAO. The
dosage of both U0126-EtOH and picroside II was 20 mg/kg.
LPS Group (n=24) The inflammation inducer, LPS, was
diluted in 1 % sodium chloride and administered into rats by

Extraction of Total Protein After anesthetizing four rats
from each group as mentioned above, whole rat brains were
removed, and 100 mg of ischemic brain tissue from each rat
was collected and placed into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Then,
100 μl of cell lysis buffer mix (1 ml lysis buffer+10 μmol/l
PMSF) was added to every 10 mg tissue. The tissues were
homogenized at 4 °C in an ice bath, completely lysed with
gentle shaking at 4 °C for 30–60 min, and centrifuged at 12,
000 r/min for 15 min at 4 °C (Eppendorf 5801, Germany), and
the supernatant was collected. Concentration of the total protein was determined using an enhanced BCA protein assay kit.
The protein samples were mixed with 5× sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample loading buffer at a ratio of 1:4, boiled at 95–97 °C for
5 min, and stored at −80 °C.
Extraction of Total RNA About 100 mg of fresh brain tissue
was removed from the ischemic cortex for total RNA extraction using the TRIzol reagent. Reverse transcription of RNA
was performed using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit according to the manufacturers’ instructions and stored at −80 °C.

Evaluation Index
HE Staining The rat brain sections were de-waxed, washed,
and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). Under light microscope, the nuclei in the sections appeared blue, while the cytoplasm appeared red. Cells were observed microscopically under
400× magnification (Leica DMI400, Germany), and the stained
cells were counted from randomly chosen four non-overlapping
views of the cortex in each section. The data are expressed as
mean±SD. The denatured cell index, which indicates the degree
of cell damage, was calculated using the formula, denatured cell
index (DCI)=denatured cell number/total cell number.
TUNEL TUNEL staining was performed on paraffin sections
using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Under a 400-fold
immunofluorescent microscope (wavelength 515 nm), the apoptosis cells appeared fluorescent green in the nucleus and
averaged in four random views of the cortex.
Immunohistochemical Staining The brain sections were dewaxed, washed, and treated as follows based on the manufacturer’s guidelines: suppress endogenous peroxidase activity,
incubate with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-pERK1/2 monoclonal antibody, 1:100, rabbit anti-pMEK1/2 monoclonal antibody, 1:100, rabbit anti-rat COX2 monoclonal antibody, 1:200)
for 1 h at 37 °C, incubate with secondary antibodies for 1 h at
room temperature, stain with DAB, and counterstain with hematoxylin. Microscopic observations revealed brown granules
in positive cell plasma. No response was observed in samples
incubated with 0.01 mmol/l PBS instead of primary antibody.
Four non-overlapping views of the cortex in each brain section

were randomly selected as above to count the cells, and the
results are presented as mean±SD. The positive cell index indicating the expression of protein was calculated as positive
cell index (PCI)=number of apoptotic cells/total cells.
Western Blot About 20 μg of total protein was separated on a
10 % SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto positively charged
nylon (PVDF) membranes using semi-dry blotting apparatus
(Bio-Rad Co. Ltd., USA). After transfer, the membrane was
blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (TBST)
and 10 % non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature and then
incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-pERK1/2
monoclonal antibody, 1:2000; rabbit anti-ERK1/2 polyclonal
antibody, 1:1000; rabbit anti-pMEK1/2 monoclonal antibody,
1:1000; rabbit anti-MEK1/2 polyclonal antibody, 1:1000; rabbit anti-COX2 monoclonal antibody, 1:500; rabbit anti-β actin
antibody, 1:200) overnight with gentle shaking at 4 °C. Next,
the blot was washed with TBST for 5 min×3 times and incubated with secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1 h with gentle
agitation at room temperature. The blot was washed three
times with TBST for 5 min each. Then, the HRP substrate
(Immobilon TM Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate,
Millipore, USA) was added on the membrane and incubated
for 1 min before obtaining images using the BioSpectrum 810
imaging system (UVP, USA) for 90 s. The gray value of each
band was analyzed using the Quantity One software, and the
relative value of the protein (RVP) was calculated as the gray

experiment was repeated five times, and the results are presented as mean±SD.
Real-Time PCR COX2 primers were designed with Primer
Premier 5.0 and synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Biotech.
Sequence of the forward primer was ACC ACC GCT GCC
ACA ACT; sequence of the reverse primer was GGT TGG
AAC AAG GAT TT. These primers amplified a 118-bp-long
product. GAPDH primers (92 bp) were purchased from
Shanghai Sangon Biotech. Reactions were performed in a
PCR system in a 20-μl total volume containing 10 μl 2×
SYBR Premix Ex Taq, 0.8 μl forward primer (10 μM),
0.8 μl reverse primer (10 μM), and 1 μl cDNA. PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s for initial denaturation,
40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s for denaturation, and 60 °C for 30 s
for extension. The melt curve analysis showed a single peak
indicating the amplification of a single product and absence of
non-specific amplification and primer dimers. Melt curve reaction conditions were 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s for xx
cycles. Each reaction had three replicates, and the mean Ct
value of each sample was recorded to calculate relative expression of COX2 using the formula 2 −△△Ct (Livak and
Schmittgen).
Statistical Analysis
The SPSS 17.0 software was used for all statistical analyses.
Multi-group comparisons were made with factorial design
ANOVA, and two-group comparisons were made with least
significant difference (LSD) tests. The values were considered
to be significant when P<0.05.

Results
Neurological Behavioral Function
mNSS scores showed that all rats had neurological behavioral
malfunction except rats in the control group (Table 1). Higher
mNSS scores indicate greater neurological behavioral impairments. Within-group comparisons before and after treatment
revealed an obvious increase in mNSS scores in the model,
LPS with picroside and LPS groups at different time points.
Significant decrease was also observed in the picroside,
U0126 with picroside, and U0126 groups (t =3.33–8.10,
P<0.05). The results indicted that picroside and U0126 treatment could improve neurological behavioral function in rats
with MCAO, while LPS could worsen neurological behavioral dysfunction following cerebral ischemia. After treatment,
the effects of different drugs at various times after MCAO
were evident from significant differences in mNSS scores in
these groups (F=415.92, 2.06, P<0.01), while no significant

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 57:335–351

difference was observed in therapeutic time (F=1.84, P>0.05).
Based on the LSD values, rats showed normal neurobehavioral
function in the control group but in the model group, the scores
gradually increased as time progressed (t=0.95–2.37, P>0.05)
indicating abnormal function. In the picroside group, LSD values
notably declined compared to the model group (t=5.22–7.60,
P<0.05). The LPS with picroside group had the second highest
values at ischemic 6 h, but the values decreased subsequently.
While the LPS group had the highest scores at any given time
and picroside could decrease mNSS values, we think that there
may be an existing antagonism effect between LPS and piceoside
II. But in early stage, LPS occupied a leading position. At ischemic 12 and 24 h, picroside decreased mNSS values. However,
owing to the always existing of cerebral ischemic injury, mNSS
scores were still higher than before treatment. In the U0126 with
picroside groups, the mNSS scores were marginally lower than
the picroside group (t=0.47–1.87, P>0.05). In U0126 group,
mNSS was close to picroside group (t=0, P>0.05). These results
suggest that picroside II and U0126 could improve neurological
behavioral function in rats with MCAO.
Histological Changes
HE staining showed that in the control group, nerve cell arrangement was organized well with complete structure and no
significant difference in DCI values at the different time
points. However, in the model group, at ischemic 6 h, the
neuron arrangement was irregular with deeply colored condensed nuclei, increased gap around the nerves, and degenerative changes such as formation of vacuoles and necrosis in a
growing number of the neurons with increasing time. At ischemic 12 and 24 h, the gaps were much larger and DCI
values were higher than those at ischemic 6 h (t=5.50, 7.75,
P<0.05). In the picroside group, the neuronal cell damage was
only marginal when compared to the model group; neurons
were well arranged with clear outline, nuclei condensation,
deep coloration observed only in a small number of cells,
and no obvious difference in DCI values with increase in time
(t=0.81–1.89, P>0.05). In the LPS with picroside group, at
ischemic 6 h, neuron damage was marked with irregular neuron arrangement, pyknotic and dark nuclei, and large number
of holes. However, at ischemic 12 and 24 h, these damages
were recovered a little. In the U0126 with picroside group, the
damage to nerve cells was milder with shriveled bodies and
deeply stained nuclei. With passage of time, the damages were
gradually recovered although statistical significance was not
observed among the different time points (t= 0.72–2.25,
P>0.05). In the LPS group, there were a lot of cells with
condensed nuclei and there was a little increase in DCI with
passage of time (t=0.63–2.80, P>0.05). In U0126 group, the
damage of the cells was slight, and DCI values at different
time was close to picroside group (t=0.10–1.63, P>0.05)
(Fig. 1 and Table 2).

Neuronal Apoptosis
Because significant differences were not observed among the
various therapeutic times and time-drug interaction (F=2.37,
0.55, P>0.05), we combined the images at different time in
the same group together to analyze (Fig. 2). In the control
group, only a few apoptotic cells (14.17±4.49) were scattered
in the cortex. In the model group, the number of apoptotic
cells (166.90±5.81) was significantly higher than the control
group (t=50.96, P<0.05). In the picroside group, the number
of apoptotic cells (62.0±6.06)was lower when compared with

the number of apoptotic cells in B group was much higher
than those in D (151.60±7.42 ) and F group (149.20±10.33)
(t=5.12, 5.92, P<0.05). No difference was found between D
and F groups (t=0.81, P>0.05). In the U0126 with picroside
group, neuronal apoptosis (40.83±8.02) was lower, which
was slightly higher than the control group (t=8.90, P<0.05),
but was a little lower compared with picroside group and
U0126 group (t=7.06, 5.81, P<0.05). According to the results, we found that in C, E, and G groups, the number of
apoptotic cells was significantly lower than those in B, D,

and F groups, which indicated that picroside II and U0126
could reduce neuronal apoptosis after cerebral ischemic injury.
And in U0126 with picroside group, the number of apoptotic
cells was even lower when compared with C and G groups,
which indicated that there may exist the synergistic action
between picroside II and U0126.
Immunohistochemical Staining
pMEK1/2 Expression
We found significant differences in pMEK1/2 expression
among the groups treated with the different drugs and
drug-time interaction (P<0.01). LSD values indicated that
in the control group, only a few cells were positive for
pMEK1/2 expression and no significant difference was
found among the different time points in ischemia (t=
0.11–0.24, P>0.05). In the model group, the PCI increased as time progressed, but no significant difference
was observed (t=0.47–1.86, P>0.05). A large number of
neurons became pyknotic and deeply colored. In the
picroside group, PCI was significantly lower than the
model group at any given time (t=6.54–11.93, P<0.05).
The LPS with picroside and LPS groups had the highest
PCI at ischemic 6 h; massive neurons appeared pyknotic
and deeply colored with a hole formation. At ischemic 12
and 24 h, PCI in the LPS with picroside group gradually
decreased, but in LPS group, PCI was still the highest at
any given time. In U0126 with picroside and U0126
groups, PCI was obviously lower than model group at
any time (t = 6.53–14.22, P < 0.05). Especially, PCI in
U0126 with picroside group was a little lower, and at
ischemic 12 and 24 h, there was no significant difference
compared with control group (t=3.90, 3.12, P >0.05).
These results indicated that pMEK expression increased
following cerebral ischemia, and picroside and U0126
could inhibit pMEK action following cerebral ischemia
(Fig. 3 and Table 3).
The pERK1/2 Expression
Statistical analysis of pERK1/2 expression in the different
groups suggested that different drugs could significantly affect
pERK1/2 expression following MCAO (F=120.99, P<0.05),
but different therapeutic times and drug-time interaction could
not significantly affect pERK1/2 expression (F=0.22, 0.83,
P>0.05). So, we combined the images at different time in
the same group together to analyze. A pairwise comparison
of LSD data showed that the neurons in the control group
exhibited a uniform basophilic blue, and only a few pERK1/
2-positive cells were observed. In the model group, the number of pERK1/2-expressing cells increased markedly with
control group. The PCI rose significantly compared with

control group (t=23.57, P<0.05) with some condensed neurons and vacuole formation. In the picroside group, PCI was
0.21±0.04, which was significantly lower than model group
(t=16.74, P<0.05). PCI in the LPS group was a little higher
when compared to the other groups, but no significant difference was found (t = 1.25, P > 0.05). In the U0126 with
picroside group, PCI increased slowly, which was obviously
higher than picroside group (t=4.71, P<0.05), but no statistical difference was observed when compared with the U0126
group (t=2.10, P>0.05). PCI in LPS was the highest in all
groups, but there were no significant difference compared
with model group or LPS with picroside group (t =2.06,
0.81, P<0.05). From above results, we found that ERK1/2
was activated following MCAO, and LPS could promote
pERK1/2 expression, while picroside and U0126 could inhibit
pERK1/2 expression (Fig. 4 and Table 4).

COX2 Expression
Effects of the different drugs and drug-time interaction on
COX2 expression were significant (F = 523.27, 2.04,
P<0.05). In the control group, PCI was the lowest at all
time points (t=0.23–0.82, P>0.05). In the model group,
PCI was higher and increased as time progressed, but no
statistical difference was found among the different time
points (t=0.66–3.24, P>0.05). At ischemic 24 h, PCI was
the highest. In the picroside group, PCI was notably lower
than the model group at a given time point (t=12.15–14.10,
P<0.05). With time progressing, there was a slight increase
in PCI, and the neurons appeared slightly damaged. At
ischemic 12 and 24 h, PCI was significantly lower when
compared with U0126 with picroside group (t=4.12, 4.76,
P<0.05). In the LPS with picroside group, at ischemic 6
and 12 h, PCI was a little higher than model group (t=
1.19, 1.34, P>0.05), however at ischemic 24h PCI was a
little lower compared with model group (t=2.01, P>0.05).
In the U0126 with picroside group, PCI was at a lower
level at different time (t=0.12–0.40, P>0.05). In the LPS
group, PCI was close to model group (t = 1.19–2.01,
P>0.05). In the U0126 group, PCI was a little higher than
U0126 with picroside group, but no statistic difference was
found (t=1.46–2.87, P>0.05) (Fig. 5 and Table 5).
In summary, the three indices exhibited the same trend
suggesting that cerebral ischemia could activate the MEKERK1/2-COX2 pathway and induce neuron damage.
Picroside II could play a neuroprotective role by inhibiting
the MEK-ERK1/2-COX2 pathway after cerebral ischemia.

The Expression of pMEK1/2
Expression of pMEK1/2 protein varied among the control,
model, and various treatment groups (Fig. 6). Statistical analysis revealed a significant influence of the different drug treatments and therapeutic times on the expression of pMEK1/2
after MCAO (P<0.01). LSD showed that pMEK1/2 expression level in the control group was low. At ischemic 6, 12, and
24 h, pMEK1/2 expression increased marginally without statistically significant difference (t = 0.11–0.52, P > 0.05).

Higher pMEK1/2 expression was observed in the model
group, which further increased as time progressed. At ischemic 24 h, the protein expression reached its peak. In the
picroside group, pMEK1/2 expression decreased slowly during the different time points (t=2.33–2.56, P>0.05), but at
each time point, the expression was significantly lower when
compared to the model group (t=4.02–15.94, P<0.05). In the
LPS with picroside group, at ischemic 6 h, the pMEK1/2
protein expression was higher but it decreased steadily at ischemic 12 and 24 h; however, the expression level at any time

pMEK1/2 expression was similar to the control group at any
given time point (t=1.36–3.83, P>0.05). In LPS group, at
ischemic 6 h, pMEK expression was the highest, and then, it
decreased to some extent. In U0126 group, at ischemic 6 h, the
pMEK expression was statistically lower than picroside group
(t=8.40, P<0.05), while at ischemic 12 and 24 h, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups
(t=0.37, 0.88, P>0.05). At any one time point, pMEK1/2
protein expression in the model, LPS with picroside and
LPS groups were higher than the other groups (t=1.01–
23.39, P<0.05). However, the protein expression trend in
three groups was different; while pMEK1/2 protein levels
gradually increased in the model group, it gradually decreased
in the LPS with picroside and LPS groups. At ischemic 12 h,
the protein expression in three groups was almost similar (t=
0.34–1.72, P > 0.05). Besides, in picroside, U0126 with
picroside and U0126 groups, the pMEK1/2 was at a
lower level. Especially at ischemic 12 and 24 h, the
pMEK1/2 expression in U0126 with picroside was significantly lower than picroside and U0126 groups (t=
5.73–8.00, P<0.05), which indicted that there might exist synergistic effect on inhibiting pMEK1/2 expression
between picroside II and U0126.

The Expression of pERK1/2
While the different drug treatments and drug-time interaction
significantly influenced the expression of pERK1/2 following
cerebral ischemic injury (F=380.64, 8.35, P<0.01), therapeutic time had no significant influence on pERK1/2 expression
(F=2.38, P>0.05). LSD showed that in the control group,
pERK1/2 was expressed very little with no obvious difference
among the different time points (t=0.32–0.51, P>0.05). In the

model group, pERK1/2 expression increased significantly
when compared to the control group at the same time point
(t=12.21–20.14, P<0.05), and its level increased progressively with ischemic time. In the picroside group, pERK1/2 expression increased slightly at different time points (t=0–2.07,
P>0.05), but was distinctly lower than the model group (t=
5.77–12.15, P < 0.05). In the LPS with picroside group,
pERK1/2 expression level was the highest at ischemic 6 h
except LPS group, but decreased thereafter (t=3.41–3.78,
P>0.05). At ischemic 12 h, pERK1/2 expression was close
to model group (t=1.13, P>0.05). However, at ischemic 24 h,
pERK1/2 expression was much lower than model group (t=
4.42, P<0.05). In the U0126 with picroside group, pERK1/2
expression was low at all time points (t=0.17–0.37, P>0.05).
In LPS group, expression of pERK1/2 was the highest at ischemic 6 h, and no statistically significant difference was
found among different time (t = 0.14–0.31, P > 0.05). In
U0126 group, pERK expression gradually decreased and at
ischemic 24 h was a little higher than control group (t=2.99,
P>0.05) (Fig. 7).
The Expression of COX2
We found that the different drug treatments and drug-time
interaction evidently affected COX2 expression following
brain ischemia (P<0.01). LSD showed that COX2 expression in the control group was low at the three time points
(t=0.04–1.15, P>0.05). In the model group, expression of
COX2 was higher than the corresponding time point in
the control group (t = 5.80–16.60, P < 0.05). As time
progressed, COX2 expression also increased and peaked
at ischemic 24 h, which was significantly higher than
the remaining groups (t=4.31–16.60, P< 0.05). In the
picroside group, COX2 expression at ischemic 6 h was a
little higher than the model group (t=2.94, P>0.05), but
significantly lower than the model group at ischemic 12
and 24 h (t=6.23, 12.70, P <0.05). At ischemic 6 h,
COX2 protein expression in the LPS with picroside group
was significantly higher than model group (t = 8.26,
P<0.05), but it declined gradually thereafter. At ischemic
12 h, no significant differences were observed between the
model and LPS with picroside groups (t=1.10, P>0.05),
but at ischemic 24 h, COX2 expression in the LPS with
picroside group was evidently lower when compared to
the model group (t=6.00, P<0.05). In the U0126 with
picroside group, COX2 expression was low and increased
slowly between the different time points. In LPS group, at
ischemic 6 h, COX2 expression was the highest, which
was close to LPS with picroside group (t=0.27, P>0.05),
and then maintained this level. In U0126 group, COX2
expression was lower and increased gradually as time
progressed, which was always a little higher than picroside
group (t=0.09–3.56, P>0.05) (Fig. 8).

In conclusion, the variation trend of the three indices was
consistent indicting that cerebral ischemia could induce
COX2 expression by activating the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway.
Picroside II could reduce COX2 expression by inhibiting
MEK-ERK1/2 pathway and thereby protect the neurons.

P<0.05), then subsequently gradually decreased. In U0126
group, COX2 mRNA was still at a low level.
At any given time, COX2 mRNA level in the model, LPS,
and LPS with picroside groups was higher than the other
groups, particularly at ischemic 12 h. The level of COX2
mRNA in the picroside group, U0126 group, and U0126 with
picroside group was lower suggesting that picroside II could
reduce COX2 mRNA level following cerebral ischemia, especially at ischemic 12 h.

Discussion
Real-Time PCR
Real-time PCR showed that the different drug treatments,
therapeutic times, and drug-time interactions significantly influenced the level of COX2 mRNA following cerebral ischemia (F=74.65–470.09, P<0.05) (Fig. 9). LSD showed that
COX2 mRNA level in the model group was higher than the
control group at any corresponding time point (t=5.13–31.61,
P<0.05). At ischemic 12 h, COX2 level was higher than at
ischemic 6 and 24 h (t = 26.49, 16.21, P < 0.05). In the
picroside group, COX2 level was lower than the model group
at any given time point (t=5.07–25.39, P<0.05) and slightly
higher than the control group. In the LPS with picroside
group, COX2 mRNA was much higher than the model group
at ischemic 6 h (t=7.24, P<0.05), but slightly lower than at
ischemic 24 h (t=1.96, P>0.05). In the U0126 with picroside
group, COX2 level was slightly higher when compared to the
control group at any given time (t=1.25–2.98, P>0.05). In
LPS group, at ischemic 6 h, COX2 mRNA was the highest
when compared with the other groups (t = 8.52–20.89,

ERK1/2 signal pathway is the first discovered MAPK pathway. It has been reported that various factors, such as growth
factors, oxidative stress, and an increased intracellular Ca2+
level, could activate the ERK1/2 pathway to regulate multiple
physiological processes, including cell growth, proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis (Kovalska et al. 2012).
Following cerebral ischemia, the ischemia/anoxia ratio is
known to activate the ERK1/2 signal pathway by promoting
neural repair to protect neurons from injury (Jin et al. 2006;
Shioda et al. 2009). But a number of experiments (Namura
et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2003; Henriksson et al. 2007) have
shown that the inhibitors of MEK1/2 (U0126, PD98059, and
SL327) could prevent or improve neuronal damage and reduce cerebral infarct volume following brain ischemic injury.
These findings indicate that ERK1/2 is not beneficial to the
recovery of nerve cells after cerebral ischemia. After the onset
of cerebral ischemia, the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway has been
shown to play the following roles: (1) promoting oxidative
stress injury. Stanciu et al. (Stanciu et al. 2000) demonstrated

that glutamate activated the ERK1/2 pathway to induce oxidative toxicity in HT22 cells and primary cortical neuron cultures; however, addition of U0126 reduced the degree of injury. Liu et al. (Lu et al. 2014) showed that hyperbaric oxygen
enlarged the area of brain damage in MCAO rats with pERK1/
2 growth, and this effect was also reduced by U0126. U0126EtOH is a highly selective inhibitor of MEK1/2 and has been
reported to have no inhibitory effect on JNK and P38 suggesting that U0126-EtOH acts via pro-apoptotic and proinflammatory mechanisms. (2) promoting apoptosis.
Apoptotic pathways can be intrinsic or extrinsic. The intrinsic
pathway is induced through the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and activation of caspase-9 (Fadeel and Orrenius
2005) while the extrinsic pathway is activated by the receptors
of TNFα, Fas, and caspase-8 (Kim et al. 2006). MEK-ERK1/2
has been reported to induce nerve cell apoptosis through these
pathways (Wang et al. 2000; Schweyer et al. 2004). Using
TUNEL staining, we showed in this study that a host of apoptotic cells were observed in the model and LPS groups, while only
a few were found in the picroside treated and U0126 groups. In
the U0126 group, ACI was slightly higher than the control
group. These results indicate that cerebral ischemia could promote cell apoptosis by activating MEK-ERK1/2 and that
picroside II could protect neurons from cell apoptosis. (3) promoting inflammatory reaction. Inflammation is induced by

inflammatory factors, chemotactic factors, endothelial cell, and
leukocyte adhesion factors among others. After the onset of a
stroke, various pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1α, IL-1β,
and TNFα have been reported to increase. Elk-1 is the downstream transcription factor in the ERK1/2 pathway, which binds
to and transactivates genes including cNfos, a component of the
transcriptional factor protein-1 (AP-1) (Wang et al. 2004a). AP-1
together with different inflammatory factors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) promote the expression of inflammatory
factors. It was shown that the positive feedback between the
ERK1/2 pathway and inflammatory factors can augment inflammatory response. Maddahi (Maddahi et al. 2011) showed that
during cerebral ischemia that develops after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the expression of pERK1/2, MMP9, IL-6, IL1β, and iNOS was higher but CBF level was lower. However,
treatment with SB-386023 (inhibitor of Raf) at 0 and 6 h after
SAH normalized CBF and prevented SAH-induced upregulation
of MMPs, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and pERK1/2 proteins.
Our experiment showed that following cerebral ischemia, the
MEK-ERK1/2 signal pathway was activated along with the upregulation of COX2, but treatment with U0126 relieved the inflammatory response and prevented the high expression of
COX2. These results indicate that the activation of MEKERK1/2 pathway could lead to inflammatory reaction by inducing COX2 expression. Besides, treatment with LPS accelerated

the activation of ERK1/2. At ischemic 6 h, pERK1/2 level
peaked leading to exacerbated neuron damage and increase in
cell apoptosis. At ischemic 12 and 24 h, picroside II played a
protective role, which manifested as the recovery of neuron damage and decreased ACI although only slightly. But holes in the
neurons were still perserved, which caused by early injury. We
observed an antagonistic effect between picroside II and LPS
suggesting that the damage caused by LPS could be at an early
stage and protection from picroside II could occur at a later time
point. The results from the picroside, U0126 and U0126 with
picroside groups showed that picroside II and U0126 had a
protective effect on cerebral ischemia, and especially in U0126
with picroside group, most indices were better than picroside and
U0126 groups, but no statistically significant difference was
found.
Luo et al. (Luo et al. 2001) found that after cerebral ischemia in COX2 gene knockout mice, the cerebral infarct area
was significantly decreased than those in wild-type mice.
They suggested that COX2 and its products may participate
in cerebral ischemic injury. After cerebral ischemia, COX2
takes part in cerebral ischemia in the following manner: (1)
release of PG. COX2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic
acid (AA) to different prostaglandins (PGs). Specifically,
PGE2 can induce strong vascular contraction and chemotaxis.
Stanimirovic et al. (Stanimirovic et al. 1997) reported that
PGE2 increased the adhesion of allogeneic neutrophils to
cerebro-microvascular endothelial cells (HCEC) and induce
inflammatory reaction. Besides, Bezzi (Bezzi et al. 1998)
proved that PGs could stimulate calcium-dependent glutamate
release in astrocytes and lead to neurotoxicity. (2) The second
is increase free radical oxidation. Free radical oxidation is
responsible for cytotoxicity via DNA damage and production
of lipid peroxide. Canderlarion-Jalil et al. (Candelario-Jalil
et al. 2003) demonstrated a significant increase in PGE2
levels, glutathione depletion, and lipid peroxide production
after transient global cerebral ischemia and 24–48 h reperfusion. But post-ischemic treatment (starting 6 h following reperfusion) with rofecoxib (COX2 inhibitor) significantly

reduced oxidative damage observed at 48 h after the initial
ischemic episode. Miyamoto et al. (Miyamoto et al. 2003)
suggested that indomethacin (a COX inhibitor) could protect
neurons by reducing the level of ischemia-induced 8-OH-dG,
a highly sensitive marker of DNA oxidation, in the hippocampus after ischemic insult. (3) Next is promote neuronal cell
apoptosis following brain ischemia. Zhang (Zhang et al. 2004)
found that in primary rat cortical neuron cultures, hypoxia/
reoxygenation led to the upregulation of COX2 expression
along with several DNA fragments, while the COX2 inhibitor,
NS398, significantly reduced DNA fragmentation indicating
that COX2 participated in neuronal apoptosis following cerebral ischemic injury. Ye (Ye et al. 2012) also showed that
parecoxib (COX2 inhibitor) could ameliorate post-ischemic
mitochondria-mediated neuronal apoptosis induced by focal
cerebral ischemia by preventing the release of cytochrome c
and the activation of caspase-3 in the penumbra. In our experiment, the high ACI levels in the model and LPS group were
likely induced by COX2 expression via the MEK-ERK1/2
signal pathway. Moreover, these two groups also registered a
significant increase in COX2 mRNA and protein levels

indicting that the upregulation of COX2 following brain ischemia could aggravate cerebral ischemic injury. Finally, the
highest COX2 mRNA expression was observed earlier than
the peak in COX2 protein expression suggesting that the regulation of COX2 is likely at the transcriptional level.
Picroside II is the main component in Picrorhiza, which is
the traditional Chinese medicine used to treat cold. Modern
pharmacological studies (Li et al. 2000, 2002) showed that
picrorhiza played a neuroprotective role. Our research also
showed that picroside II treatment following cerebral ischemic
injury could relieve cerebral edema and thereby improve the
neurological behavioral function by inhibiting various proinflammatory factors such as TNFα and MMP9 via the
TLR4-NFκB signal pathway (Li et al. 2010a; Guo et al.
2010). In addition, picroside II could ameliorate the neuronal
apoptosis induced by MCAO via the activation of caspase-3
and PARP (Nagasawa and Kogure 1989) and act as an antioxidant by upregulating SOD and preventing iNOS expression (Sun et al. 2011). Based on the presence of S-100, NSE,
and MBP, the best therapeutic dose of intraperitoneal
picroside II injection was 10–20 mg/kg body weight and treatment time was 1.5–2.0 h following cerebral ischemia (Sun
et al. 2011). Our results showed that rats with MCAO manifested neurological dysfunction and an increase in apoptotic
cells; pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2 also increased significantly,
suggesting that activation of ERK1/2 signal pathway; an increase in COX2 mRNA and protein levels was observed with
peak mRNA expression at ischemic 12 h ahead of the protein
expression peak; the different indices were similar in the model group and LPS group; the activation of ERK1/2 pathway
was attenuated in the picroside treatment and U0126 groups
with the recovery of neurological function. These results suggest that following brain ischemia, the upregulation of COX2
expression induces neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory reaction through the MEK-ERK1/2 signal pathway, which
could be one of mechanisms by which ERK1/2 mediates cerebral ischemic injury. Picroside II could downregulate COX2
expression after MCAO by inhibiting MEK-ERK1/2 in rats to
protect neurons. A limitation of this study is that we did not
detect the upstream MEK1/2.
