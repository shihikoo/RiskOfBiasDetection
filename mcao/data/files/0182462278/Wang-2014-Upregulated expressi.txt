Abstract Cerebral ischemia represents a severe brain
injury that could lead to significant neuronal damage
and death. In this study, we performed a middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) in adult rats and observed that
a subunit of nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) transcriptional
factor, NF-YC, was accumulated in rat hippocampal
CA1 neurons. Immunochemistrical and immunofluorescent analysis revealed that NF-YC was primarily
expressed in the nucleus of neurons. Meanwhile, we
found that the changes of bim , one of the target genes
of NF-Y, were consistent with the expression of NF-YC
and Bim was mainly located in the NF-YC positive
cells. Moreover, there was a concomitant upregulation
of active caspase-3 and TUNEL positive cells. Taken
together, these results suggested that the upregulation of
NF-YC might play an important role in the pathophysiology via proapoptotic protein Bim after MCAO and

Introduction
Stroke, one of the leading causes of disability and death,
remains a challenging clinical problem (Murray and Lopez
1997). Stroke leads to more than one million deaths per
year (He et al. 1995; Zhao et al. 2008), accounting for
nearly 10 % of all deaths in the world annually. In developed countries, stroke accounts for more than 4 % of direct
health care expenditure (Saka et al. 2009). In developing
countries, such as China, the incidence rate of ischemic
stroke increased rapidly in recent years (Wang et al.
2009). Stroke could be mainly divided into ischemic cerebral apoplexy and hemorrhagic cerebral apoplexy (Reisner
1972). In the two types of strokes, ischemic cerebral apoplexy results from a transient or permanent reduction in
cerebral blood flow that is restricted to the territory of a
major brain artery (Kanareikin et al. 1977). The pathophysiological mechanisms of cerebral ischemia remain largely
unclear. Numerous factors have been implicated in ischemic brain injury, such as excitotoxicity (Beal 1992),
ionic imbalance (Gusev and Skvortsova 2002), inflammation (Pirttila and Kauppinen 1992; Rothwell and
Hopkins 1995), and reactive oxygen species (McCord
1985; Watson and Ginsberg 1989). The factors together
might result in apoptosis, which was considered as a
key determinant for the content of brain injury and

clinical outcome (Dirnagl et al. 1999). Thus, a better
knowledge with the mechanism of neuronal apoptosis
during cerebral ischemia would help clarify the neuropathological process of cerebral ischemia, and therefore,
provide potential therapeutic targets for the curing of
the disease.
Nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y), also termed CP1 or CBF, is an
ubiquitous heterotrimeric eukaryotic transcription factor
and found in a variety of eukaryotic promoters and enhancer elements (Chodosh et al. 1988; Hatamochi et al. 1988).
NF-Y consists of three subunits: NF-YA, NF-YB, and NFYC, which are all essential for DNA binding of CCAAT
boxes (Mantovani 1999). NF-YC was cloned from the
yeast initially (McNabb et al. 1995). The protein expression
and mRNA levels of NF-YC are similar in different human
tissues except in testis (Bellorini et al. 1997). NF-YC and
NF-YB interact with each other and with NF-YA through
histone fold motif. NF-Y specifically recognizes and targets
the common CCAAT promoter element. While many
genes contain CCAAT promoter element involve in
antiapoptosis (Bcl-2 , BAG , etc.) (Ly et al. 2013; Magan
et al. 2003) or proapoptosis (ACHE, bim , etc.) (Gatta et al.
2011; Hughes et al. 2011). So, NF-Y is a bifunctional transcription factor (Ceribelli et al. 2008). For example, it was
reported that in vivo data indicate that NF-Y and p53 are
strictly connected in the control of cell cycle progression upon
DNA damage and the balance between NF-Yand p53 governs
the pro- and antiapoptotic transcriptional response, silencing
of NF-YB by RNA interference induces caspase-dependent
apoptosis by activating p53 and decreased the expression of
Bcl-2 (Ly et al. 2013; Magan et al. 2003). In other words, NFY plays an antiapoptotic role in the balance. Some others
reported that the transcription factor NF-Y binds to a
conserved inverted CCAAT box in the rat bim promoter, then NF-Y cooperates with another transcription
factor forkhead boxO3A (FOXO3a) to recruit CBP/
p300 to the bim promoter to form a stable multiprotein/DNA complex, which activates the transcription
of bim in neurons after survival factor withdrawal (Hughes
et al. 2011; Mantovani 1998; Sanphui and Biswas 2013).
Therefore, NF-Y is a multifunctional protein that plays a
crucial role in cell apoptosis and survival.
Bim is a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein whose
proapoptotic function is critical for apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway (Shi et al. 2005). Recent studies suggested that
Bim exerted a crucial function in neuronal apoptosis under
various pathological conditions (Biswas et al. 2005).
Induction of Bim has been observed in the process of
neuronal apoptosis caused by NGF withdrawal, while Bim
deletion could remarkably attenuate the apoptotic response
(Biswas and Greene 2002; Hughes et al. 2011). Further,
Bim was increased in the neurons of Alzheimer’s disease
and associated with β-amyloid-induced neuronal apoptosis

553

(Biswas et al. 2007). Studies also revealed that JNKmediated phosphorylation of Bim under stress conditions
strongly potentiate its proapoptotic activity, resulting in
subsequent neuronal apoptosis (Putcha et al. 2003).
Intriguingly, JNK-mediated Bim translocation was related
with neuronal apoptosis during transient focal cerebral ischemia (Okuno et al. 2004). Further, the study indicated
that Bim was also induced rapidly in transcriptional level in
transient focal cerebral ischemia. While some studies found
that FOXO3a was an important regulator for stress-induced
bim transcription, much remains unclear with the detailed
mechanism involved in the process (Luo et al. 2013;
Kopycinska et al. 2013; Carbajo-Pescador et al. 2013;
Guan et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2008). A recent study showed
that NF-Y interacted with FOXO3a and played an essential role in Bim induction and the apoptosis of sympathetic neurons following NGF withdrawal (Hughes
et al. 2011). These findings together implied that Bim
could be a critical mediator of stress-induced neuronal
apoptosis and transcriptional factor NF-Y might exert a
key role in the process.
Since Bim has been implicated in neuronal death in
cerebral ischemia, we questioned whether NF-Y had any
role in directing Bim expression, and thus, the pathology of
the disease. Meanwhile, selective vulnerability of neurons
in the CNS to ischemic injury is a well-known phenomenon
that is particularly evident in the hippocampal CA1
subregion (Kirino 1982; Pulsinelli et al. 1982). In the
study, we established a right middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) models in adult rats and investigated the cellular localizations and functions of NF-YC
and Bim in hippocampal CA1 subregion. Our findings
suggested that NF-YC might be involved in Bim induction and neuronal apoptosis following MCAO. Our
work might help gain a brighter insight into the mechanism of neuronal apoptosis during MCAO, and thus,
provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of
MCAO.

suffering. Rats were housed in the same animal care
facility during a 12 h light/dark cycle throughout the
protocol with free access to food and water. As previously described (Longa et al. 1989), these rats were
subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia induced
by transient right MCAO for 90 min. Firstly, animals
were deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection
of chloral hydrate (10 % solution, 0.36 ml/kg) and
placed in a supine position. The body temperature of
rats was controlled at 37±0.5 °C during surgery with a
homoeothermic blanket. Secondly, after taking the neck
midline incision (about 2–2.5 cm), the right common
carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed. Subsequently, CCA
was occluded with a clamp while the ECA branch was
electrocoagulated distally. A 4–0 (about 5–6 cm) heparinized
nylon thread coated with a rounded tip was advanced from the
carotid bifurcation into the ICA until it blocked the
origin of the MCA. During this process, we stopped
when feeling the slight resistance. After 90 min, reperfusion was established by gently pulling out the nylon
thread (n = 46). The contralateral carotid artery was
exposed similarly, but not after ischemia. Shamoperated animals (n =16) were anesthetized and surgically prepared but did not undergo MCAO. The overlying muscles and skins were closed in layers with 4–0
silk sutures and staples, and the animals were allowed
to recover on a 30 °C heating pad. These animals were
not allowed to recover from anesthesia until the wound
was closed, and they were sent to their cages. Rats
were killed at 3, 6, and 12 h and 1, 3, 5, and 7 days
after MCAO, and sham-operated rats were sacrificed at
3 days.
The neurological function of the rats was assessed blindly at 3, 6, and 12 h and 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after MCAO,
respectively. The neurological defects scores were assigned
based on the previously published criteria (Bederson et al.
1986). The Bederson’s scoring criteria is as follows: no
deficits score, 0; unable to extend the contralateral forelimb
score, 1; flexion of contralateral forelimb score, 2; mild
circling to the contralateral side score, 3; severe circling
and allying to the contralateral side score, 4. Meanwhile,
we eliminated no postoperative survival to the time point of
rats, supplementary model animals at any time to ensure
that each group of four rats.

Western Blot Analysis
Rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (10 % solution) and sacrificed at different time points postoperatively (n =4 for each time point). To obtain samples for
western blot, took out the whole brain, then the hippocampus ipsilateral and contralateral to the occluded side
was dissected out. The hippocampus was stored at
−80 °C until assayed. To prepare lysates, frozen brain
tissue samples were minced with eye scissors in ice.
After that, the samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (1 % NP-40, 50 mmol/L Tris, pH=7.5, 5 mmol/L
EDTA, 1 % sodium deoxycholate, 1 % Triton X-100,
1 mmol/L PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml
leupeptin), centrifuged at 12,000 rpm, and 4 °C for
20 min to collect the supernatant. After determination
of its protein concentration with the Bradford assay
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), 50 μg of every sample was
subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The
separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidine
difluoride filter membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by a
transfer apparatus at 350 mA for 2.5 h. The membrane was
then blocked with 5 % nonfat milk for 2 h and incubated with
primary antibody against anti-NF-YC (anti-rabbit, 1:500;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz; sc-7715-R ),
anti-active caspase-3 (anti-rabbit, 1:500; Santa Cruz;
sc-7148), anti-Bim (anti-mouse, 1:500; Santa Cruz; sc374358), or anti-β-actin (anti-mouse, 1:1000; Santa
Cruz; sc-8432) at 4 °C overnight. After being incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the separated proteins were visualized using an
enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Pierce
Company, USA).
Sections and Immunohistochemistry
After defined survival times, rats (n =3 for each time point)
were terminally anesthetized and perfused through the ascending aorta with 500 ml of 0.9 % saline, followed by 4 %
paraformaldehyde. After perfusion, the brains were removed and postfixed in the same fixative for 3 h, then
replaced with 20 % sucrose for 2–3 days, following 30 %
sucrose for 2–3 days. After treatment with sucrose solutions, the tissues were embedded in OTC compound. Then,
7 μm frozen cross-sections were prepared and examined.

Fig. 1 The changes in neurological functions following MCAO.
Bederson’s scores scale was carried out to evaluate the neurological deficits
after MCAO. Rats (n =4) were killed at each time point (at 3, 6, and 12 h
and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post-injury). The data are reported as mean ±
values (n =3, *p <0.05, significantly different from the sham groups)

All sections were stored at −20 °C. After the sections had
been prepared, they were kept in an oven at 37 °C for
30 min and rinsed twice in 0.01 μM phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) (pH = 7.2) for 5 min. The sections were
processed in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH=6.0) and heated
to 121 °C in an autoclave for 3 min to retrieve the antigen.
The sections were taken from the pressure cooker and
cooled to room temperature naturally. After rinsing in
PBS, all of these sections were blocked with confining
liquid consisting of 10 % donkey serum, 1 % BSA, 0.3 %
Triton X-100, and 0.15 % Tween-20 for 2 h at room
temperature, then incubated with anti-NF-YC antibody (anti-rabbit, 1:100; Santa Cruz) overnight at 4 °C, followed by
incubation in biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The sections were
rinsed again for 5 min (three times) and incubated in
the avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex (ABC Kit; Vector
Laboratories) for 40 min at 37 °C. Staining was visualized with 0.02 % diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
(DAB; Vector Laboratories). Finally, the sections were
dehydrated, cleared, and covered with cover slips. The
sections were observed at ×5, ×10, ×20, or ×40 magnifications on a Leica light microscope (Germany). We
examined the sections and counted the cells with strong
or moderate brown staining vs. weak or no staining as
positive vs. negative NF-YC cells, respectively, from
each group at higher magnification. We took the average assays of each group as the result.
Double Immunofluorescent Labeling
In double immunofluorescent labeling, the sections were
prepared as previously mentioned. First of all, we blocked

555

the sections with 10 % normal serum blocking solution
which is the same species as the secondary antibody, containing 9 % BSA, 0.1 % Triton X-100, and 0.05 % Tween20 2 h at room temperature to avoid unspecific staining.
Then, the sections were incubated with antibodies for antiNF-YC (anti-rabbit, 1:100; Santa Cruz)/anti-Bim (antimouse, 1:100; Santa Cruz)/anti-active caspase-3 (anti-rabbit, 1:500; Santa Cruz) and different markers are as follows:
NeuN (neuron marker, 1:200; Chemicon, Temecula, CA),
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; astrocytes marker,
1:200; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), CNpase (oligodendrocytes
marker, 1:200; Sigma), and CD11b (microglia marker,
1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). In brief, sections were
incubated with both primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C,
followed by a mixture of FITC- and TRITC-conjugated
secondary antibodies for 2 h at 25 °C. In order to detect
the morphology of apoptotic cells, sections were covered with DAPI (0.1 mg/ml in PBS; Sigma) for 1 h at
30 °C. The stained sections were examined with a Leica

level of NF-YC in the hippocampus at various time points after

relatively low in the sham-controlled caudate, but progressively increased from 3 h to 3 days after MCAO reached the peak at 3 days
and then reduced thereafter (a ). The expression of NF-YC in the
contralateral hippocampus after MCAO was also detected by western
blot, but there was no change (b ). Quantification graphs of the

Quantitative Analysis
We counted the NF-Y positive cells in immunohistochemistry
sections per square millimeter. This counting was performed in
the hippocampus CA1 subregion and recorded. Cells double
labeled between NF-YC and the other phenotypic markers used
in the experiment were quantified. To identify the proportion of
each phenotype-specific marker positive cells expressing NFYC, at least 200 phenotype-specific marker positive cells were
counted 1 mm in the hippocampus CA1 subregion. Then,
double-labeled cells for NF-YC and phenotype-specific
markers were recorded 1 mm in the hippocampus CA1 subregion. Two or three intermittent sections (50 μm apart) per
animal were sampled. To identify the proportion of NeuN
positive cells expressing TUNEL/caspase-3, a minimum of
200 NeuN positive cells were counted adjacent to the wound
in each section. Then double-labeled cells for TUNEL/caspase3 with NeuN were recorded.
Statistical Analysis
All values were expressed as mean ± standard error of mean
(SEM). The statistical significance of the data was analyzed
by analysis of variance, post hoc tests, and Pearson correlation
test with SPSS13.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc). All data were
analyzed with Stata 7.0 statistical software (Systat Software
Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). p <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Every experiment consisted of at least three
replicates per condition.

Results
Neurological Deficits Following MCAO in Adult Rats
To explore the neuropathological process of MCAO, we
established a MCAO model in adult rats and evaluated the
changes in neurological functions following MCAO.
Bederson’s scores scale was applied to examine the neurological
deficits after MCAO (Bederson et al. 1986). As shown in Fig. 1,
animals showed severe circling to the contralateral side immediately after MCAO and then gradually decreased afterward.
However, the overall neurological deficit scores did not improve
significantly during the period of experimental procedure,
suggesting a long-term insult in brain function after MCAO.
Elevated Expression of NF-YC in the Hippocampus
After MCAO
Next, we sought to determine the expression of NF-YC protein after MCAO using western blot analysis. In the ipsilateral
hippocampus, the NF-YC protein level gradually increased
from 3 h to 3day after MCAO, reached the peak at 3day, and

557
Fig. 4 Double immunofluorescence staining of NF-YC and different
phenotype-specific markers in the hippocampal CA1 subregion.
Coronal sections at sham and 3 days after MCAO were taken. These
sections were divided into two groups, the ischemic hippocampus (d–
f and j–u) and the sham-controlled hippocampus (a–c and g–i). The
sections were labeled with NF-YC (red : a, d, g, j, m , p, and s) and
different cell markers (green : b , e , h , k , n , and q ), including
neuronal marker (NeuN ), astrocyte marker (GFAP), oligodendroglial
marker (CNpase), and microglia marker (CD11b), as well as nucleus
marker (DAPI ) (t). The yellow color visualized in the merged images
represented co-localizations of NF-YC with NeuN (c , f) and the
purple indicated the co-localizations of NF-YC with the nucleus
(u ). Quantitative analysis of neuron-specific marker positive cells
expressing NF-YC (%) in the sham group and 3 days after MCAO
were showed (v ). The changes of NF-YC expression in brain
hippocampal CA1 subregion after MCAO are significantly in
neurons (*p <0.05). Error bars represent SEM. Scale bar=50 μm in
a (applies to a–u)

then slightly decreased at 5day and 7day (Fig. 2a, c).
However, we didn’t observed any apparent changes in NFYC in the contralateral hippocampus (Fig. 2b, c). These
findings indicated that NF-YC was accumulated in rat hippocampus after MCAO.
The Changes in NF-YC Expression and Distribution
in the Hippocampus After MCAO
Some previous studies have shown that the hippocampal CA1
subregion is more sensitive to cerebral ischemia (Kirino 1982;
Pulsinelli et al. 1982). Therefore, the hippocampal CA1 subregion was selected as the main observation area in this study.
To determine the changes in NF-YC expression and distribution after MCAO, we carried out immunohistochemistrical
analysis with anti-NF-YC antibody on transverse cryosections.
In sham and contralateral hippocampus, an apparent distribution of NF-YC was found in the hippocampal CA1 cells
(Fig. 3a, b, d, and e). Further, NF-YC localized in the nucleus.
Besides, the number of NF-YC positive cells in ipsilateral
hippocampal CA1 subregion was significantly increased at
3 days after MCAO (Fig. 3c, f). There was no staining in the
negative control sections with control rabbit IgG (Fig. 3g).
Quantitative analysis demonstrated that elevation in the number of NF-YC-positive cells after MCAO was statistically
significant (Fig. 3h; p <0.05). These results suggested that
the elevated expression of NF-YC after MCAO was mainly
due to dramatic increase in the number of NF-YC positive
hippocampal CA1 cells.
The Colocalization of NF-YC with Different
Phenotype-Specific Markers in the Hippocampus
After MCAO
In order to investigate the NF-YC cellular localization in
the hippocampus after MCAO, double labeling immunofluorescent staining was performed in transverse cryosections

558

J Mol Neurosci (2014) 52:552–565

of brain tissues with cell-specific markers: NeuN (a marker
of neuron), GFAP (a marker of astrocyte), CD11b (a marker
of microglia), and CNpase (a marker of oligodendrocyte).
As shown in Fig. 4, NF-YC was predominantly colocalized
with neuron marker NeuN, suggesting that NF-YC was
mainly distributed in hippocampal CA1 cells (Fig. 4a–f).
However, we could not detect any obvious localization of
NF-YC in astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes
(Fig. 4g–r). Further, we analyzed the number of NF-YC
positive neurons in sham and ipsilateral hippocampus.
Consistent with western blot and immunohistochemistrical
results, we found that the elevation of NF-YC positive
neurons was statistically significant (p <0.05, Fig. 4v).
These results were consistent with the results of immunohistochemistry staining, and the cellar localization of
NF-YC appeared to be confined to the nucleus of
neurons.
Increased Expression of Proapoptotic Protein Bim in Rat
Hippocampus After MCAO
Since it was reported that transcriptional factor NF-Y
played an essential role in Bim expression under stress
conditions, we are interested in whether the elevated expression of NF-YC protein in MCAO could exert a role in
inducing Bim expression. Thus, we detected the expression
of Bim using western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, the
expression of Bim was remarkably increased and reached
the peak at 3 days after MCAO, which was correlated with
the expression pattern of NF-YC. Besides, double immunofluorescent assay revealed that Bim was colocalized
with neuron marker NeuN (Fig. 5e, h), while the
colocalzation between Bim and astrocyte marker GFAP
was barely observed (Fig. 5k, n). The finding suggested
that Bim was also mainly distributed in CA1 cells in rat
hippocampus. What is more, we found that Bim was
mainly located in NF-YC positive cells (Fig. 5q, t) and
this result is consistent with previous reports that bim is
one of the target genes of NF-Y. Further, when compared with sham group, the number of Bim positive
cells increased significantly in the hippocampus at
3 days after MCAO. Therefore, consistent with previous
reports (Shibata et al. 2002; Tsuchiya et al. 2011), these
results implicated a possible involvement of NF-YC in
promoting the expression of Bim, whose mechanism
might contribute to the neurological deficits following
MCAO.
Detection of Apoptosis in the Adult Rats Hippocampal
CA1 Subregion
It has been widely acknowledged that Bim was a
proapoptotic Bcl-2 member implicated in the apoptosis of

of Bim (red : c, f , i , l ) and different phenotype-specific markers
including NeuN (green: d and g) and GFAP (green: j and m ) in
the hippocampal CA1 subregion was showed (c–n). As well as the
co-localization between of Bim (green: p and s) and NF-YC (red: o
and r) was detected (q and t). These sections were divided into two
groups, the ischemic hippocampus at 3 days after MCAO (f–h, l–n,
r–t) and the sham-controlled hippocampus (c–e, i–k, and o–q). The
yellow color visualized in the merged images represented colocalizations of Bim with NeuN (e and h). Quantitative analysis of

a variety of cell types, including neuronal cells. Thus, we
speculated that the elevated Bim expression in rat hippocampus after MCAO might trigger hippocampal CA1 cells
for apoptosis. To confirm this assumption, we first detected
the expression of active caspase-3 in the ischemic hippocampus using western blot analysis. It was found that the
expression of active casepase-3 (19 kDa protein) was
changed at a similar tendency with NF-YC and Bim
(Fig. 6). Meanwhile, the cellular distribution of active
caspase-3 was analyzed using immunofluorescence analysis. In sham-treated group, active caspase-3 positive cells
were barely observed (Fig. 6c–e). However, a large number
of active caspase-3 positive neurons were identified in
ischemic hippocampus at 3 days after MCAO (Fig. 6f–h).
The number of active casepase-3 positive cells was
counted and found to be significantly elevated in hippocampus after MCAO. Next, we performed TUNEL
staining in brain sections at sham-operated and ipsilateral hippocampus 3 days after MCAO; TUNEL labeling
revealed that apoptotic cells were significantly increased (p <0.05) following MCAO compared with the
sham-controlled (Fig. 7). These findings further confirmed our hypothesis that the expression changes in
NF-YC and Bim might be associated with the apoptosis
of hippocampal CA1 cells.

Discussion
In the current study, we performed MCAO models in
adult rats to mimic acute ischemic brain injury and
investigated the expression profiles of NF-YC and Bim
in adult rats after MCAO. First, we showed that rats
exhibited an apparent neurological deficit after MCAO.

following MCAO. Further, double immunofluorescent

and cerebral ischemia would significantly augment the
number of NF-YC positive neurons. Moreover, we
probed the expression of Bim, a target gene of NFYC, using western blot and immunofluorescence analysis. We found that the expression of Bim evidently

increased after MCAO, and Bim was mainly located
in the NF-YC positive cells in immunofluorescence
analysis. Finally, we proved a significant neuronal apoptosis in the adult rat hippocampus CA1 subregion by
measuring the expression of active caspase-3 and

TUNEL. In conclusion, these data were parallel with
the hypothesis that upregulation of NF-YC after MCAO
might trigger the apoptosis of hippocampus CA1 neurons by promoting bim transcription, highlighting NFY-mediated Bim expression might be an important molecular event and potential therapeutical target of cerebral ischemia.
Cerebral ischemia initiates a series of pathological
events, evolving from hours to days to result in profound
and devastating damage in focal or diffuse brain region,
particularly in the hippocampus (McDaniel et al. 1991).
These events include excitotoxicity, infarct, inflammation,
reactive oxygen species, and reactive nitrogen species
(Hossmann 1996; Katsura et al. 1994; Leist and
Nicotera 1998; Lindsberg et al. 1991; Thornberry 1998).
The events might lead to a massive neuronal apoptosis,

which was considered as a key determinant of the extent
of neurological damage and recovery after ischemia. Bcl2 family proteins play an important role in mediating the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Cuende et al. 1993). In response to ischemia, the level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 and Bcl-XL together with the proapoptotic protein
Puma, Bid and Bim, were all upregulated (Engel et al.
2011). Among the proteins, Bim is a proapoptotic BH3only member of Bcl-2 family (Gross et al. 1999), which
induces the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through promoting cytochrome c release from mitochondria
(O’Connor et al. 1998). Subsequently, released cytochrome c interacts with Apaf-1 and caspase-9 to form
the apoptosome, which could effectively induce
caspase-9 activation (Acehan et al. 2002). Then, activated caspase-9 triggers the activation of caspase-3 and

showed that how NF-YC plays a
role in the apoptosis of neurons
after MCAO. After MCAO, the
expression of NF-YC is
gradually increased, then NFYC, NF-YB, and NF-YA
interacts with each other to NFY. NF-Y binds to the CCAAT
box and cooperates with
FOXO3a to form a stable multiprotein complex to recruit some
CBP/p300 to the bim promoter
increases the rate of
transcription of bim.
Subsequently, Bim protein
synthesis is increased, which
causes the downstream cascade
(black arrow), actives caspase-3
and caspase-7, finally promotes
apoptosis of neurons

caspase-7, eventually leading to rapid and irreversible
apoptosis (Martinou and Youle 2011; Siegel 2006;
Ullah et al. 2011). Several reports have suggested a
crucial role of Bim in modulating neuronal death under
various conditions, including NGF withdrawal, embryonic development, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and
cerebral ischemia (Hetz et al. 2007; Putcha et al.
2001). Thus, Bim could be an important regulator of
neuronal apoptosis. In keeping with the findings, we
showed that Bim was potently induced in hippocampal
CA1 neurons after MCAO, which was accompanied
with a dramatic increase in apoptosis of the neurons.
The finding suggested a possible link between elevated
Bim expression and neuronal apoptosis following
MCAO, implying that interfering Bim expression might
be a potential therapeutical value for the treatment of
cerebral ischemia.
The regulation of Bim in the pathological conditions
remains largely elusive. Some studies have shown that
Bim could be regulated at the transcriptional level in neurons, and FOXO3a was supposed to play an important role
in the regulation of Bim transcription under stress conditions (Huang and Strasser 2000). Recently, it was reported
that transcriptional factor NF-Y cooperated with FOXO3a
to recruit CBP/p300 to Bim promoter after NGF withdrawal. NF-YC is one of the three subunits of NF-Y and provides the binding capacity of the transcriptional factor
avidly to the CCAAT elements in transcriptional regulatory

regions. Gurtner and coworkers demonstrated that NF-Y
also activated a tumor suppressor network that functions
at multiple levels to efficiently induce cell death in wt p53expressing cells (Benatti et al. 2008). Thus, NF-Y
seemed to possess dual roles in the regulation of apoptosis. It represses p53 to avoid the hyperactivation of
p53 signaling that triggers the apoptotic cascade (Cui
et al. 2013). On the other hand, it promotes the transcription of proapoptotic genes to maintain adequate
apoptotic response. Thus, NF-Y might balance the
proapoptotic and antiapoptotic signaling in neuronal
cells, which might be disrupted under pathological conditions. Since it has been well documented that p53 was
rapidly activated in MCAO, the elevated expression of
NF-YC during MCAO might be prone to elicit a
proapoptotic function through Bim-dependent
signaling(Li et al. 1994).
In summary, we, for the first time, investigated the
expression profiles of NF-YC and Bim in hippocampal
CA1 subregion after MCAO. These results support a
hypothetical model (Fig. 8) in which NF-YC plays a role
in the apoptosis of neurons via proapoptotic protein Bim
after MCAO. However, much remains unclear with the
detailed mechanism of Bim expression and neuronal death
during cerebral ischemia. More works should be
conducted to clarify the intrinsic mechanisms of neuronal
apoptosis after MCAO, and a detailed role of NF-YC
modulated Bim expression in this regard.
