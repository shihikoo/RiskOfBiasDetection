a b s t r a c t
To develop novel and effective treatments for ischemic stroke, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of
the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin in a mouse model system of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Intraperitoneal administration of azithromycin signiﬁcantly reduced blood–brain barrier damage and cerebral
inﬁltration of myeloid cells, including neutrophils and inﬂammatory macrophages. These effects resulted in a
dose-dependent reduction of cerebral ischemic damage, and in a remarkable amelioration of neurological deﬁcits
up to 7 days after the insult. Neuroprotection was associated with increased arginase activity in peritoneal exudate cells, which was followed by the detection of Ym1- and arginase I-immunopositive M2 macrophages in the
ischemic area at 24–48 h of reperfusion. Pharmacological inhibition of peritoneal arginase activity counteracted
azithromycin-induced neuroprotection, pointing to a major role for drug-induced polarization of migratory macrophages towards a protective, non-inﬂammatory M2 phenotype.

1. Introduction
The evolution of ischemic brain damage is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced
by a superimposed inﬂammatory reaction that involves soluble mediators, including cytokines and chemokines, as well as specialized cells
activated in the brain or recruited from the periphery (Kamel and
Iadecola, 2012; Amantea et al., 2015). Besides the activation of resident
glial cells, recruitment of blood-borne cells, including macrophages,
neutrophils, dendritic cells and T lymphocytes, occurs both in animal
models and in human stroke (Price et al., 2004; Gelderblom et al.,
2009; Kamel and Iadecola, 2012; Perez-de-Puig et al., 2015). Accordingly, recent microarray studies have demonstrated that the majority of
genes acutely upregulated in the blood of ischemic stroke patients are
expressed by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and, to a lesser degree,
by monocytes, and most of these genes regulate inﬂammatory responses (Tang et al., 2006; Barr et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2012).
Neutrophil accumulation in the infarcted tissue has been reported to
cause brain injury in rodent models (Matsuo et al., 1994; Jiang et al.,
1995; Connolly et al., 1996; Perez-de-Puig et al., 2015), correlating
with the severity of brain tissue damage and a poor neurological

outcome in humans (Akopov et al., 1996). Moreover, brain inﬁltration
of hematogenous macrophages exerts a dualistic role in brain damage,
mostly depending on their polarization status (Frieler et al., 2011;
Gliem et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012; Fumagalli et al.,
2015). The classic macrophage M1 phenotype may promote injury,
whereas alternatively activated M2 macrophages scavenge debris
and promote angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and repair (Sica and
Mantovani, 2012; Italiani and Boraschi, 2014). Thus, a strategic
approach to improve clinical success of immunomodulatory drugs in
stroke would be to limit the detrimental effects, while promoting the
reparative mechanisms (Amantea et al., 2015).
Azithromycin (9-deoxy-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin
A) is a macrolide antibiotic approved worldwide to treat a variety of
community-acquired infections. This drug displays the peculiar pharmacokinetic feature of accumulating in white blood cells — particularly
macrophages and neutrophils — owing to its stability at low pH values
in lysosomes (Fieta et al., 1997; Bosnar et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2007). As
a result, and due to its dibasic nature, azithromycin shows prolonged
antibacterial as well as antinﬂammatory and immunomodulatory
effects (Parnham et al., 2014).
Based on the hypothesis that such properties can confer novel
therapeutic potentials on azithromycin, we here report that this drug
affords neuroprotection in experimental ischemic stroke. Following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in mice, azithromycin

signiﬁcantly reduced blood–brain barrier (BBB) injury and brain damage
over a prolonged period of time. The neuroprotective effects of the drug
could be traced to its ability to reduce brain inﬁltration of circulating neutrophils and to promote peripheral macrophage polarization towards the
non-inﬂammatory M2 phenotype.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and drug treatments
Experiments were performed on adult C57Bl/6 male mice, weighing
24–26 g (Charles River, Calco, Como, Italy). Animals were housed under
controlled environmental conditions with ambient temperature of 22
°C, relative humidity of 65% and 12 h light:12 h dark cycle, with free access to food and water.
Animal care and experimental procedures were carried out following the guidelines of the Italian Ministry of Health (DM 116/1992 and
DL 26/2014), in accordance with the European directive 2010/63/UE,
and the protocol (Protocol Number 120000344) was approved by the
Committee set by the Ministry of Health at the National Institute
of Health (Rome). All efforts were made to minimize the number of
animals used and their suffering.
A scheme of the experimental design is provided in Table 1.
Azithromycin (Zithromax®, azithromycin dihydrate for injection,
Pﬁzer) was dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl) and administered at the indicated doses (0.15–150 mg/kg) (n = 5–6 animals for each dose) by the
intraperitoneal route upon reperfusion or up to 6 h after the beginning
of reperfusion (n = 5–6 animals for each time-point).
The selective arginase inhibitor (Baggio et al., 1999), amino-6boronohexanoic acid (ABH ammonium salt, Enzo Life Sciences), was
dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl) and administered i.p. at a dose of 0.1 or
10 mg/kg, 15 min before MCAo. Vehicle-control animals received an
i.p. injection of saline (1 ml/kg). Each experimental group consisted of
5–6 animals.
2.2. Focal brain ischemia
Transient brain ischemia was induced by occlusion of the origin of
the middle cerebral artery, using a relatively non-invasive technique
previously described (Armogida et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, C57Bl/6 mice
were anesthetized with 1.5–2% isoﬂurane vaporized in air and the
external carotid artery was isolated and cut approximately 1.5 mm
above the common carotid artery bifurcation. A silicone-coated nylon
ﬁlament (diameter: 0.23 mm, Doccol Corporation, Redlands, CA, USA)
was then advanced through the external carotid artery into the internal
carotid artery for 10–12 mm from common carotid artery bifurcation,
up to the circle of Willis were a mild resistance and a 85–90% cortical
cerebral ﬂow reduction indicate occlusion of the origin of the middle
cerebral artery. To allow reperfusion, the ﬁlament was withdrawn
30 min after MCAo. Despite all efforts were made to optimize surgical
conditions and post-surgical care, seventeen animals died during or
immediately after surgery.

117

During surgery, cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) was monitored over the
cerebral cortex of the ischemic hemisphere, corresponding to the supply territory of the middle cerebral artery, by lased-Doppler ﬂowmetry
(Periﬂux System 5000, Perimed, Sweden). To this aim, a ﬂexible laserDoppler probe was glued onto the parietal bone and local CBF was continuously measured, keeping the animal under isoﬂurane anesthesia,
from 15 min before MCAo up to 15 min after the beginning of reperfusion. Twelve animals were excluded from the study because of unsuccessful MCAo.
2.3. Neuropathology and quantiﬁcation of ischemic damage
To assess brain infarct damage, animals were sacriﬁced 48 h after the
beginning of reperfusion and their brains were rapidly removed and
immediately frozen in isopentane cooled with dry ice. Coronal sections
(20 μm-thick) were cut, at 0.5 mm intervals from the frontal pole, using
a cryostat, mounted on glass slides and stained with cresyl violet. Images of cresyl violet-stained sections were captured by a digital scanner
and analyzed using an image analysis software (ImageJ, version 1.30).
Infarct volume (mm3) was blindly determined by summing the
infarcted (pale) areas of the coronal tissue slices and multiplying the
obtained value by the interval-thickness between sections. Infarct
edema was calculated by subtracting the size of the whole contralateral
(non-infarcted) hemisphere from the whole ipsilateral (infarcted)
hemisphere.
Neurological deﬁcits were examined 7 days after MCAo by an experimenter (FP) blinded to the treatment schedule, using a modiﬁed ﬁvetiered grading system (Longa et al., 1989). A score of 0 was given if
the animal demonstrated normal spontaneous movements (no deﬁcit);
a score of 1 was given if the animal was failing to fully extend the contralateral forepaw when held by the tail and slowly lowered to observe
symmetry in the extension of both forelimbs while the mouse reached
the wire-mesh; a score of 2 was given if the animal demonstrated a reduced resistance to a lateral push; a score of 3 was given if the animal
was turning towards the contralateral side when held by the tail on a
ﬂat surface; a score of 4 was given if the animal was falling towards
the contralateral side; and a score of 5 was given if the animal showed
no spontaneous movement with a depressed level of consciousness.
2.4. Splenic carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)
injections
Monocyte/macrophage migration was tracked by intrasplenic CFSE
injection following an already established protocol (Seifert et al.,
2012) with minor modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, 48 h prior to MCAo, the spleen
was exposed by making a midline skin incision at the caudal terminus of
the 13th rib on the anatomical left. A solution of CFSE (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was administered (8 mg/kg)
by three injections of 30 μl each, evenly spaced out in three sites of the
spleen. The spleen was then reinserted into the abdominal cavity and
the skin incision was sutured.

2.5. Evaluation of BBB permeability
A 4% solution of Evans Blue (Sigma-Aldrich, Italy) in saline was
administered i.p. (8 ml/kg of body weight). The dye was allowed to circulate for 2 h and then mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and
transcardially perfused with 50 ml of heparinized 0.1 M PBS, at room
temperature. The brains were quickly removed, divided into right and
left hemispheres and immediately weighed. Each hemisphere was
immersed in 400 μL formamide and incubated at 50 °C for 48 h for
dye extraction. The tissue was removed and 500 μL of pure formamide
were then added to each tube. Evans Blue stain was measured by spectrophotometer at 620 nm and quantiﬁed according to a standard curve.
The results are presented as μg of Evans blue/g of tissue.
2.6. Immunohistochemistry
Animals (n = 4 per experimental group) were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused through the heart
with heparinized (4000 U/ml) saline (0.9% NaCl) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB, 0.1 M; pH 7.4). Each brain was
rapidly removed, post-ﬁxed for 2 h and cryoprotected by incubation in
30% sucrose in PB solution at 4 °C. 40 μm-thick coronal brain sections,
at the level of the MCA territory (1.18 to − 0.10 from Bregma), were
obtained using a cryostat and collected in PB.
After a pre-incubation for 1 h in blocking solution (5% normal
donkey serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PB), sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-NeuN
(anti-neuronal nuclei; 1:200 dilution; ABN78, Merck Millipore, Italy)
to label neurons, rat anti-CD11b (1:200 dilution; code MCA74, AbD
Serotec, UK) or rabbit anti-Iba-1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor
molecule-1; 1:500; code 019-19741, Wako Chemicals, USA) to label
microglia/macrophages, rat anti mouse Ly-6B.2 (1:200; code MCA771,
AbD Serotec, UK) to label neutrophils, goat anti-arginase I (N-20;
1:100; code 18351, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Germany) and rabbit
anti-Ym1 (1:100; code 01404, StemCell Technologies, UK) to label
alternatively-activated microglia/macrophages (Sica and Mantovani,
2012). After three washes in PB, sections were incubated for 2 h at
room temperature in a solution containing an appropriate mixture of
the corresponding secondary antibodies labeled with AlexaFluor 488
or AlexaFluor 594 (1:400 dilution; Molecular Probes; Invitrogen,
Italy). Finally, nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI, 1:500; Sigma-Aldrich, Italy), and the sections
were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, air-dried and coverslipped
with Fluoromount (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) as previously described
(Amantea et al., 2014b). Immunostaining was examined under a
ﬂuorescence microscope (Leica DMI6000B, Leica Microsystems Srl,
Italy) equipped with a high-resolution digital camera (Leica DFC350FX)
and a dedicated software (LAS AF6000) for image analysis and
deconvolution.
To quantify neutrophils (Fig. 2D), Ly-6B.2-immunopositive cells
were counted in the ipsilateral cortex and striatum of vehicle- and
azithromycin-treated mice subjected to transient MCAo. Brieﬂy, three
coronal brain sections, corresponding to the middle cerebral artery territory, were taken from each brain at 0.98, 0.38 and − 0.22 mm from
bregma. Digitized images were acquired under identical microscope
settings and cells were counted off-line, using ImageJ software, in
three different optic ﬁelds of the confocal images (acquired through
the 20 × objective) of the ispilateral striatum and of the ispilateral
cortex. For each optic ﬁeld, the total number of DAPI + cells labeled
for Ly-6B.2 were counted and expressed as Ly6B-immunopositive
cells/mm2.
2.7. Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was employed to assess the expression of speciﬁc
cell surface markers in leukocytes isolated from the brain and from

the peritoneal cavity. To this end, ipsilateral and contralateral forebrains
were rapidly dissected and washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution
(HBSS). Tissue samples were then dissociated to a single-cell suspension using a papain-based MACS Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit
(Miltenyi Biotec) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The
cells from two hemispheres were resuspended in 3 ml of 70% Percoll
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and overlaid on the top with 4 ml of
30% Percoll solution overlayered with 3 ml PBS. Percoll was prepared
by dilution in PBS. The gradient was centrifuged at 1500 rpm with no
brake for 25 min at room temperature and the cells were collected
from the 30% to 70% interface, washed in PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of
10% fetal bovine serum in HBSS and counted.
For ﬂow cytometry analysis, cells were treated with anti-CD16/32
(clone 2.4G2; BD Bioscences) for Fc receptor blockade, and then stained
with FITC- or phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-CD11b (clone M1/70; BD
Biosciences), anti-F4/80 (AbD Serotec), anti-Gr1 (BD Bioscences), antiCD206 (BioLegend), anti-Ym1 (Stem Cell Technology) as previously
described (Pallotta et al., 2011). Cellular populations were identiﬁed
as follows: F480+/CD11b+ as microglia/macrophages, CD11b+/Gr1+
as inﬂammatory myeloid cells (including Ly6G+ granulocytes and
Ly6C+ inﬂammatory monocytes), F480+/Gr1+ as inﬁltrating inﬂammatory macrophages, F480+/Ym1+ as M2-macrophages (Ingersoll et al.,
2010; Lee et al., 2012; Italiani and Boraschi, 2014; Ritzel et al., 2015).
FITC- and PE-conjugate monoclonal antibodies with irrelevant speciﬁcity were used as negative controls. Analysis was done on an EPICS
ﬂow cytometer using EXPO 32 ADC software (Beckman Coulter). The
number of M2 macrophages in the ispilateral hemisphere (Fig. 3A)
was calculated as the percentage of F4/80+/Ym1+ cells in the inﬁltrating leukocytes isolated through Percoll gradient as described above.
2.8. Arginase activity assay
Arginase activity was assessed by measuring the concentration of
urea generated by the arginase-dependent hydrolysis of L-arginine
(Arranz et al., 2012). Enzyme activity was determined in peritoneal exudate cells harvested by thorough washing of the peritoneal cavity with
6 ml of media (PBS). After centrifugation at 1650 rpm for 8 min (4 °C),
pelleted cells were lysed with a buffer containing 25 mM Tris–HCl,
0.4% (wt/vol) Triton X-100 and 0.1% protease inhibitor cocktail
(P8340, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy); then, samples were centrifuged
(13.000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was collected and frozen (− 80 °C). At 100 μL aliquots of this cell lysate (approximately
50 μg proteins), 20 μL of a solution containing 10 mM MnCl2 in 25 mM
TrisHCl (pH 7.5) were added. The mixture was incubated for 10 min
at 56 °C for enzyme activation. Then 100 μL of the substrate,
0.5 M L-arginine (pH 9.7), were added and incubated for 60 min at
37 °C. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 800 μL of acidic
solution mixture (H2SO4/H3PO4/H2O = 1:3:7). For colorimetric determination of urea, a volume of 40 μL of α-isonitrosopropiophenone (9%
dissolved in 100% absolute ethanol) was added to each sample and
the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 45 min. The urea concentration
was determined spectrophotometrically by the absorbance at 540 nm.
Urea production was calculated from a standard curve and was
expressed as μmol urea/min/mg protein. The speciﬁcity of the assay
was demonstrated by the evidence that addition of 5 μM ABH to the incubation buffer signiﬁcantly reverted arginase activity in rat liver homogenates [arginase activity (μmol urea/min/mg protein): buffer with
ABH, 6.07 ± 0.48, n = 3; buffer w/o ABH, 95.07 ± 3.49, n = 3;
P b 0.01, unpaired Student's t-test].
2.9. Statistics
Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and
subjected to statistical analysis using Graph-Pad Prism version 5.00 for
Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) as speciﬁed in each
ﬁgure legend. The Student's t-test was used for comparison of a single

D. Amantea et al. / Experimental Neurology 275 (2016) 116–125

factor between two groups, whereas one-way or two-way ANOVA
was used to compare more than two groups. P values below 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. Azithromycin reduces brain infarct damage and neurological deﬁcit
caused by transient MCAo in mice
Intraperitoneal administration of azithromycin dose-dependently
reduced brain infarct damage in mice subjected to 30-min MCAo,
followed by 48-h reperfusion (Fig. 1A–C). When azithromycin was administered at the time of reperfusion, the ED50 for its neuroprotective
effect was 0.59 mg/kg (95% CI = 0.24–1.43) (Fig. 1A). The drug reduced
infarct damage in peri-ischemic cortical regions, as revealed by cresyl
violet staining of coronal brain sections (Fig. 1C). Brain edema was
also signiﬁcantly reduced at the highest tested doses (1.5–150 mg/kg)
(Fig. 1B). The neuroprotective effects of azithromycin were not associated with blood ﬂow modiﬁcations, since the reduction of CBF induced by
MCAo and re-establishment of cerebral perfusion after intraluminal ﬁlament withdrawal were not affected by the drug (Fig. 1D). Neuroprotection by acute administration of azithromycin was long lasting,
because a single dose of the drug (150 mg/kg, but not lower doses —
data not shown) given upon reperfusion produced a signiﬁcant

119

reduction of brain damage and neurological deﬁcit at 7 days of reperfusion in mice undergoing 30-min MCAo (Fig. 1E).
To characterize the time-window for the neuroprotective effects of
azithromycin in the mouse model of transient MCAo, the drug was administered as a single dose up to 6.5 h after the insult. Azithromycin
was more effective when injected upon reperfusion, and its ability to
reduce brain infarct volume and edema was signiﬁcant when the drug
was administered up to 4.5 h after MCAo (Fig. 1F).
3.2. Azithromycin reduces MCAo-induced BBB leakage and brain
inﬁltration of inﬂammatory myeloid cells in mice
BBB leakage, occurring in the ipsilateral hemisphere from 2 to 48 h
after reperfusion in the vehicle injected animals subjected to 30-min
MCAo, was signiﬁcantly reduced by 150 mg/kg azithromycin given i.p.
at the time of reperfusion (Fig. 2A). This effect was associated with reduced brain recruitment of blood-borne cells, as shown by ﬂow cytometry and immunoﬂuorescence analysis. A signiﬁcant increase in the
percentage of CD11b+/Gr1+ inﬂammatory myeloid cells inﬁltrating
the ispilateral ischemic hemisphere occurred after 2 and 24 h of reperfusion in control mice receiving vehicle (Fig. 2B). Neuroprotection by
azithromycin was directly associated with a decreased number of
CD11b+/Gr1+ inﬂammatory myeloid cells inﬁltrating the ipsilateral
brain hemisphere at 2–24 h of reperfusion — and in the contralateral tissue as well, at 2 h of reperfusion — relative to vehicle treatment (Fig. 2B

in the representative immunoﬂuorescence images) and by the improvement of neurological deﬁcit as compared to vehicle-injected controls. (F) A single dose of azithromycin

post hoc test, n = 4 animals per experimental group).

and C). This effect occurred both in the cortex and the striatum, as revealed by immunoﬂuorescence analysis of Ly6B.2-immunopositive
neutrophils at 48 h of reperfusion (Fig. 2D). The inhibition of cerebral
inﬁltration of inﬂammatory myeloid cells was persistent, because a
dramatic, 2-fold reduction in CD11b+/Gr1+ cells was observed after
7 days of reperfusion in the ispilateral hemisphere (data not shown).
3.3. Azithromycin promotes polarization of microglia/macrophages
towards M2 phenotypes
Consistent with recent ﬁndings (Ritzel et al., 2015), we failed to ﬁnd
any change in the number of F4/80+/CD11b+ microglia/macrophages
of the ipsilateral hemisphere of vehicle-injected animals as compared
to sham at either 2 or 24 h after reperfusion (Fig. 2E).
Azithromycin reduced the number of F4/80+/CD11b+ microglia/
macrophages in the ipsilateral hemisphere as compared to vehicletreated animals after 2-h reperfusion (Fig. 2E). This was associated
with a signiﬁcant reduction in F4/80+/Gr1+ inﬁltrating inﬂammatory
macrophages in the ischemic hemisphere (Fig. 2F). By contrast, at

such early reperfusion time (i.e., 2 h), the percentage of brain F4/80+/
Ym1+ — with an M2-like phenotype (Kigerl et al., 2009; Sica and
Mantovani, 2012) — was increased by azithromycin relative to
vehicle-injected and sham-operated animals (Fig. 3A).
Immunoﬂuorescence experiments conﬁrmed that Ym1immunopositive cells were indeed increased by azithromycin in both
striatum and cortex in mice undergoing 30-min MCAo followed by
48-h reperfusion (Fig. 3B). Most of those cells co-localized with globular
CD11b-immunopositive cells and were clearly macrophages inﬁltrating
from the periphery as documented by their immunopositivity for CFSE
(Fig. 3C).
The expression of arginase I, a marker of the M2 macrophage phenotype (Kigerl et al., 2009; Sica and Mantovani, 2012), gradually increased
at 24–48 h of reperfusion in the frontoparietal ischemic cortex of mice
treated with azithromycin (Fig. 3D). Although at 24 h arginase I was
almost exclusively expressed by hypertrophic Iba1-immunopositive
cells likely resembling activated microglia, at later stages colocalization
mainly occurred in globular Iba1-stained cells, likely resembling reactive ameboid microglia or macrophages. Of interest, the increased M2

greater percentage of microglia/macrophages in the brain of mice treated with the drug (Fig. 2E). Also, expression of both Ym1 and arginase I

and 48 h (Fig. 4C) of reperfusion.
Intraperitoneal administration of the selective arginase inhibitor
ABH at the dose of 10 mg/kg (ABH 10), but not at the dose of
0.1 mg/kg (ABH 0.1), 15 min before MCAo, abolished the increase in arginase activity induced by azithromycin in peritoneal cells (Fig. 4C),
and it counteracted neuroprotection (Fig. 4D). This points to a crucial
role for arginase, a marker of macrophage alternative activation, in the
neuroprotective effects of azithromycin.

3.4. Pharmacological inhibition of arginase activity in peritoneal exudate
cells reverts neuroprotection

4. Discussion

The induction of macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype in the periphery is a contributing factor to neuroprotection by
azithromycin. Accordingly, we found that 30-min MCAo followed by
24-h reperfusion increased the number of F4/80+/Ym1+ M2 macrophages in the peritoneum, and that this effect was signiﬁcantly potentiated by administration of a neuroprotective dose of azithromycin
(150 mg/kg) at the time of reperfusion (Fig. 4A). Azithromycin also produced a 5-fold increase in the number of Ym1+ and CD206+ M2 macrophages in the peritoneal cell exudate from mice undergone transient
MCAo (data not shown). This effect was associated with a signiﬁcant

The results from the present study demonstrate that acute administration of azithromycin reduces brain infarct damage and BBB leakage in
mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, with an
extended time-window, drug treatment being effective when administered up to 4.5 h after the insult. The ED50 for the neuroprotective effects of azithromycin (0.59 mg/kg) is lower than the bactericidal dose
of the drug in mice and is 100 times lower than the dose demonstrated
to be well tolerated in humans (Luke et al., 1996). Neuroprotection was
associated with reduced brain inﬁltration of inﬂammatory myeloid
cells, including neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, and with an

increased number of M2-polarized cerebral microglia/macrophages
and of M2-polarized peripheral macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of peripheral arginase activity prevented neuroprotection by
azithromycin, suggesting that a shift in macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype underlies the beneﬁcial effects of the drug.
Azithromycin is an acid-stable 15-membered-ring macrolide with
peculiar pharmacokinetic characteristics, including its ability to accumulate in peripheral tissues and to penetrate and accumulate into the
brain (Araujo et al., 1991; Lode, 1991; Jaruratanasirikul et al., 1996;
Luke et al., 1996). Moreover, azithromycin accumulates in macrophages
and polymorphonuclear leucocytes at levels greater than those found in
tissues and at concentrations 250 to 600-fold higher than those in
serum (Lode, 1991; Fieta et al., 1997; Liu et al., 2007).
Because of the crucial role of macrophages and polymorphonuclear
leucocytes in the evolution of ischemic brain injury (Tang et al., 2006;
Barr et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2012) and with a view to targeting the systemic inﬂammatory response in stroke pathophysiology, the present
study was aimed at assessing any beneﬁcial effects of azithromycin in
ischemic stroke.
Acute administration of azithromycin at reperfusion did not modify
CBF, whilst it minimized BBB leakage in the ischemic hemisphere at
2–48 h of reperfusion. The clinical relevance of this ﬁnding lies in the evidence that BBB disruption via matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activation contributes to the high risk of cerebral hemorrhage associated
with tPA administration (Jin et al., 2010). Within this conceptual
frame, azithromycin, given in combination with tPA, could prevent the
toxicity associated with thrombolytic treatment, reducing the rate of

failure due to cerebral hemorrhage (Grossman and Broderick, 2013).
Notably, early and late disruption of the BBB, produced by MMPs,
cyclooxygenases and free radicals, is pivotal in blood-borne cell inﬁltration into the ischemic brain and in exposing brain antigens to T cells,
setting the stage for the onset of pathogenic immunity (Kamel and
Iadecola, 2012; Amantea et al., 2015). A dramatic accumulation of neutrophils in the infarcted tissue has been shown to occur in rodents, several minutes to a few hours after the beginning of reperfusion (Barone
et al., 1992; Jiang et al., 1995; Gelderblom et al., 2009; Grønberg et al.,
2013), as well as in ischemic stroke patients within 24 h of symptoms
onset (Akopov et al., 1996; Price et al., 2004).
Here, we demonstrate that accumulation of inﬂammatory myeloid
cells in the ischemic hemisphere does occur as early as at 2 h of reperfusion, being still evident after 24–48 h. This is consistent with the spatiotemporal accumulation of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages in
the injured parenchyma, as reported by previous studies (Gelderblom
et al., 2009; Amantea et al., 2015). Acute treatment with a neuroprotective dose of azithromycin reduces neutrophil accumulation in the brain,
and this might be crucial for the neuroprotective effects of the drug. In
fact, neutropenia induced by antineutrophil serum or blockade of neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium exerts neuroprotection in animal
models of ischemia-reperfusion injury (Mori, 1992; Matsuo et al., 1994;
Huang et al., 2000). Moreover, in ischemic stroke patients, both higher
counts of peripheral neutrophils and their brain accumulation correlate
with the severity of brain tissue damage and poor neurological outcomes
(Akopov et al., 1996; Kim et al., 2012). Indeed, neutrophils promote damage through microvessel obstruction/thrombosis, production of oxygen

D. Amantea et al. / Experimental Neurology 275 (2016) 116–125

and nitrogen free radicals, and release of MMPs that exacerbate inﬂammation and contribute to BBB damage, eventually promoting further leukocytes recruitment to the brain (del Zoppo et al., 1991; Amantea et al.,
2014b, 2015).
Although the inhibition of brain neutrophilia by azithromycin may
be a consequence of the reduced BBB leakage, it is tempting to speculate
that it is mediated by a reduced production of granulocyte-macrophage
colony stimulating factor and interleukin (IL)-1β, via activator protein-1
(AP-1) inhibition in macrophages (Bosnar et al., 2009, 2011). We have
indeed observed that azithromycin attenuates the percentage of total
(F4/80+/CD11b+) microglia/macrophages in the ischemic brain, and
of inﬁltrating (F4/80+/Gr1+) inﬂammatory macrophages. This effect
was observed 2 h after the beginning of reperfusion and was coincident
with the reduced rupture of the BBB occurring at this early stage. Nevertheless, the evidence that in the mice treated with azithromycin, at 24-h
reperfusion, the number of CD11b+/Gr1+ inﬂammatory myeloid cells is
elevated with respect to 2-h reperfusion — although to an extent not different from sham-operated controls — suggests that preservation of BBB
integrity is not the only mechanism implicated in the modulation of
brain recruitment of inﬂammatory cells by azithromycin. A similar conclusion can be drawn by the ﬁnding that, despite the signiﬁcant reduction of BBB leakage at 24 h reperfusion, azithromycin does not affect the
number of macrophages inﬁltrating the ipsilateral hemisphere.
In fact, we have observed that neuroprotection by azithromycin was
associated with an increased percentage of M2 (Ym1- and arginase Iimmunopositive) microglia/macrophages in the ipsilateral, ischemic
hemisphere of mice subjected to 30-min MCAo followed by 2–48 h of
reperfusion. More interestingly, azithromycin promoted macrophage
polarization towards the M2 phenotype in the periphery, because
markers of alternative activation (i.e. Ym1 and CD206) and arginase activity were signiﬁcantly increased in peritoneal cells by the drug treatment. Thus, macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype is
crucial for azithromycin neuroprotection. In fact, inhibition of arginase
activity by ABH prevented the reduction in brain infarct volume induced
by the drug. Although there has been extensive investigation of its possible role in alternative versus classical activation, arginase I upregulation in the mouse is considered as a useful indicator of Th2 cytokine
(IL-4 and IL-13) effects on macrophages (El Kasmi et al., 2008; Barron
et al., 2013). Arginase I is a key marker of the alternative program triggered by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) in macrophages (Gallardo-Soler et al., 2008) and arginase activity mediates most
M2-induced anti-inﬂammatory and immunosuppressive effects (Pesce
et al., 2009; Murray and Wynn, 2011). M2-polarized macrophages express high levels of arginase I that compete with inducible nitric oxide
(NO) synthase (iNOS) for the common substrate L-arginine, therefore
converting L-arginine into urea and suppressing the production of cytotoxic levels of NO (Murray and Wynn, 2011). Since alternatively activated macrophages inhibit classically activated macrophages-driven
inﬂammatory processes in part through the upregulation of arginase I,
we can hypothesis that, under our experimental conditions, pharmacological blockade of arginase by ABH reverts neuroprotection by
azithromycin through blockade of M2-mediated inhibition of M1 detrimental activities. Further experimental work is needed to understand
the molecular mechanisms by which azithromycin elevates arginase activity and promotes M2 polarization, and how these effects are linked to
neuroprotection by the drug.
After an ischemic insult, microglia/macrophages may undergo
transition towards a multitude of phenotypes, depending on the dynamic spatio-temporal production of speciﬁc environmental stimuli
(Fumagalli et al., 2015). Microglia brunching decreases over time and
ramiﬁed, resting microglia acquires a bushy morphology, with enlarged
cell bodies and multiple shorter and thicker processes, to ﬁnally exhibit
an amoeboid shape. This latter phenotype is morphologically and functionally indistinguishable from inﬁltrating macrophages (Fumagalli
et al., 2015). The classic M1 phenotype exacerbates ischemic damage
and neuronal demise through the release of harmful mediators such

123

as proinﬂammatory cytokines, proteases and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Thus, the M2-to-M1 shift driven by soluble factors released
by damaged neurons expands ischemic neuronal injury and leads to insufﬁcient neuronal recovery (Hu et al., 2012). By contrast, alternatively
activated microglia/macrophages counteract proinﬂammatory and cellular immune effector processes, providing regulatory as well as inhibitory functions, thus shaping the nature of the response (Sica and
Mantovani, 2012; Italiani and Boraschi, 2014). Polarization of microglia/macrophages towards the M2 phenotype triggers debris scavenging,
angiogenesis, tissue remodeling and repair (Sica and Mantovani, 2012;
Murray and Wynn, 2011; Italiani and Boraschi, 2014). Indeed, previous
ﬁndings have shown that preservation of alternatively activated M2
microglia/macrophages promotes neuronal survival and functional recovery under ischemic/hypoxic conditions (Frieler et al., 2011; Hu
et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2012; Ballesteros et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2014;
Won et al., 2015). Moreover, recent studies have also demonstrated
that the increased M1/M2 ratio occurring in aged mice subjected
to focal cerebral ischemia is associated with a more severe deterioration of functional outcomes and with a reduced stroke-induced
neurogenesis with respect to young animals (Moraga et al., 2015;
Suenaga et al., 2015).
The present study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate that azithromycin signiﬁcantly reduces ischemic brain injury by means of macrophage transition towards the M2 phenotype. Previous ﬁndings have
demonstrated that azithromycin shifts both mouse and human macrophages from the classically activated (M1) to the alternatively activated
phenotype (M2) (Feola et al., 2010; Vrančić et al., 2012), via mechanisms that appear to involve inhibition of AP-1 activation and impairment of lysosomal functions (Bosnar et al., 2011; Nujić et al., 2012).
These immunomodulatory effects of azithromycin have been suggested
to underlie the clinical efﬁcacy of the drug in controlling exacerbations
of respiratory diseases (Parnham et al., 2014). However, preliminary
observations from our laboratory suggest that induction of M2
phenotypes by azithromycin under ischemic conditions may involve elevation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3
phosphorylation in microglia/macrophages (D. Amantea, unpublished
observation).
By shifting macrophages towards the M2 phenotype early
after stroke, azithromycin may inhibit both BBB damage and proinﬂammatory myeloid cell accumulation in the ischemic brain.
Accordingly, previous ﬁndings have demonstrated that, by inhibiting
production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, including granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-1β, in alveolar
macrophages, azithromycin reduces lipopolysaccharide-induced
murine pulmonary neutrophilia (Bosnar et al., 2009, 2011). In turn,
GM-CSF fosters the M1-like inﬂammatory phenotype (Italiani and
Boraschi, 2014), thus further promoting the generation of a detrimental
milieu. In fact, M1 macrophages are efﬁcient producers of toxic effector
molecules (i.e., reactive oxygen species and NO) and inﬂammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1β, IL- 6, tumor necrosis factor) (Italiani and Boraschi,
2014). Thus, by reducing the ischemia-induced elevation of inﬂammatory macrophages (in favor of the M2 phenotypes), azithromycin can
minimize both the damage to the BBB and the detrimental brain inﬁltration of neutrophils.
The low toxicity proﬁle of azithromycin, long proven by its use
in humans, meets the need for testing this drug as a novel treatment
strategy for ischemic stroke (Sutherland et al., 2012). Indeed, the
repurposing of azithromycin in stroke has been patented (Amantea
et al., 2014a) and a multicenter placebo-controlled phase IIb clinical
trial (ASTRIS) has recently received approval from the ethical committee of the coordinator center.
