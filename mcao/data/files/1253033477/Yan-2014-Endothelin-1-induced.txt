Aging is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. Growth hormone (GH) and its anabolic mediator, insulin-like growth
factor (IGF)-1, decrease with advancing age and this decline has been shown to promote vascular dysfunction. In addition,
lower GH/IGF-1 levels are associated with higher stroke mortality in humans. These results suggest that decreased GH/IGF-1
level is an important factor in increased risk of cerebrovascular diseases. This study was designed to assess whether GH/
IGF-1-deficiency influences the outcome of cerebral ischemia. We found that endothelin-1-induced middle cerebral artery
occlusion resulted in a modest but nonsignificant decrease in cerebral infarct size in GH/IGF-1 deficient dw/dw rats compared
with control heterozygous littermates and dw/dw rats with early-life GH treatment. Expression of endothelin receptors and
endothelin-1-induced constriction of the middle cerebral arteries were similar in the three experimental groups. Interestingly,
dw/dw rats exhibited reduced brain edema and less astrocytic infiltration compared with their heterozygous littermates and
this effect was reversed by GH-treatment. Because reactive astrocytes are critical for the regulation of poststroke inflammatory processes, maintenance of the blood–brain barrier and neural repair, further studies are warranted to determine the
long-term functional consequences of decreased astrocytic activation in GH/IGF-1 deficient animals after cerebral ischemia.

T

he risk of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack
increases with age (1). Aging is not only the single most
important independent risk factor for the incidence of stroke,
but also is a significant predictor of stroke severity (2,3). Older
patients with ischemic stroke differ in clinical characteristics
and experience higher mortality than younger patients (4).
Although studies in experimental animals confirm that severity of cerebral injury following acute ischemia is increased
by aging (5–7), the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.
There is an increasing evidence that the age-related decline
in circulating growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth
factor (IGF)-1 levels has a key role in functional and structural impairment of the cerebral vasculature in the elderly
(reviewed recently in Ref. (8)), which could contribute to
increased incidence of stroke and poor recovery after stroke.
The cardiovascular system is an important target organ for GH
and IGF-1 and it is well-documented that in human patients
GH deficiency and low circulating levels of IGF-1 significantly increase the risk for cerebrovascular disease (9–16).

There are strong experimental data to suggest that GH/IGF-1
deficiency promotes the development of atherosclerosis
(recently reviewed in Ref. (17)), alters hemostasis (18), and
compromises cerebrovascular function (recently reviewed in
Ref. (8)). It is generally accepted that in humans the lack of
cerebrovascular protective effects conferred by the GH/IGF-1
axis is responsible for the association between short stature
and increased incidence of stroke (19,20). Studies using laboratory animal models support the conclusions of clinical and
epidemiological studies (21,22) that treatment with GH or
IGF-1 confers protection after stroke (23,24).
The Lewis dwarf rat (dw/dw) is a novel model of agerelated GH/IGF-1 deficiency. Lewis dwarf rats have normal
pituitary function except for a selective genetic GH deficiency (25,26) and they mimic many of the pathophysiological alterations present in human patients with age-related
GH/IGF-1 deficiency (including mild cognitive impairment
(27) and vascular dysfunction (28,29)). Importantly, GH/
IGF-1 deficiency in Lewis dwarf rats significantly increases

Materials and Methods
Animals
Homozygous dwarf (dw/dw) rats of the Lewis origin
were purchased from Harlan Industries (Indianapolis, IN).
Previous studies indicated that dw/dw rats have a recessive mutation in the transcription factor necessary for the
maturation of the somatotroph and therefore, pituitary
GH production and plasma GH levels are reduced with no
changes in other anterior pituitary hormones (26,30,32,33).
Homozygous dwarf (dw/dw) males were bred with females
of the Lewis strain to create heterozygous offspring
of normal size. Heterozygous females were bred with
dw/dw males to produce both dw/dw (dwarf) and heterozygote (normal size) animals used in this study. Identification of
dw/dw from their HZ littermates was based on body weight,
body growth rate, and serum IGF-1 levels as described previously (34). On postnatal day 40, 11 male dwarf rats were
randomly divided into dw/dw+saline and dw/dw+GH groups
and injected with saline or 300µg recombinant porcine GH
(Alpharma, distributed by OzBioPharm, Knoxfield, VIC,
Australia), respectively, twice per day (9–10 am and 3–4 pm)
for 8 wk. Twelve HZ rats received saline injections. Injections
were continued until sacrifice 3 days postischemia. All animal protocols were in accordance with Guidelines for the
Care and Use of Experimental Animals and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of OUHSC.
Assessment of the Effects of GH/IGF-1 Deficiency on
Endothelin-1-Induced Constriction of Isolated Middle
Cerebral Arteries
Both GH/IGF-1 deficiency and aging (28,35–45) are associated with complex phenotypic changes in the vasculature. To
confirm that GH/IGF-1 deficiency does not alter the vascular
responses to endothelin-1, we assessed endothelin-1-induced
constriction of isolated MCAs in vitro. Male dw/dw or HZ

rats (3 months, n = 5/each) were euthanized and segments of
the MCAs were isolated for ex vivo assessment of vasomotor
function as described previously (46–48). In brief, isolated segments of MCAs were mounted onto two glass micropipettes
in an organ chamber and pressurized to 60 mmHg by a pressure servo-control system (Living Systems Instrumentation,
Burlington, VE). Inner vascular diameter was measured with
a custom-built videomicroscope system and continuously
recorded using a computerized data acquisition system. All
vessels were allowed to stabilize for 60 minutes in oxygenated (21% O2, 5% CO2, 75% N2) Krebs’ buffer (at 37°C). To
assess the effects of GH/IGF-1 deficiency on vascular sensitivity to endothelin-1, changes in diameter of MCAs in response
to increasing concentrations of endothelin-1 (from 0.1 to 100
nM) were obtained. With 100 nM of endothelin-1, both groups
reached maximal constriction with complete lumen occlusion.
Therefore, the average percentage of vessel diameter changes
at this concentration was calculated and set as 100%; thereafter, all the results were normalized to this average value.
Western Blotting
To analyze the protein expression levels of endothelin-1
receptors, protein extracts of cerebral cortices (34) were used
for western blotting. Tissue samples were homogenized on
ice in freshly prepared lysis buffer consisting of RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer, 1% volume of protease
inhibitor cocktail, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4),
and 0.1 mg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Tissue
homogenates were mixed 1:1 by volume with 2 × SDS sample loading buffer [100 mM Tris–HCl pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2%
bromophenol blue, 20% glycerol, and 200 mM dithiothreitol]
and reduced by heating at 95°C for 10 minutes. Proteins were
separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 4%–
20% gradient Tris–HCl gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and
transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (BioRad) using a semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes
were immersed in blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences,
Lincoln, NE) at room temperature for 1 hour and then incubated at 4°C overnight with polyclonal rabbit antiendothelin
receptor A (ETAR), rabbit antiendothelin receptor B (ETBR),
or monoclonal mouse anti-α-tubulin (Abcam, Cambridge,
MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Thereafter,
membranes were washed with PBS containing 0.5% Tween20 for 10 minutes (three times) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with fluorescent-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc, West
Grove, PA). After another three washes, the membranes were
scanned using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR
Biosciences). Density analysis was performed using Odyssey
V3.0 software and normalized to α-tubulin.

the incidence of late-life cerebral hemorrhages (30), similar
to the effects of aging in humans. Despite these advances,
the consequences of GH/IGF-1 deficiency on neuronal damage after ischemic insult have not been fully investigated.
The current study was designed to determine the effects
of GH/IGF-1 deficiency on several outcomes of cerebral
ischemia using the dw/dw rat as the model system because
it closely mimics the age-related decline in GH and IGF-1.
In this study, cerebral ischemia was induced using a potent
vasoconstrictor (endothelin-1) injected proximal to the middle cerebral artery (MCA)to cause a transient but profound
reduction of local blood flow to the cortex and striatum
(31). This method provides rapid occlusion of the MCA
and a gradual reperfusion that lasts for 16–22 hours (31),
mimicking the temporal events of an embolic stroke. As primary endpoints infarct size, neuronal death, cerebral edema
formation, and astrocyte activation were investigated.

Evaluation of Brain Swelling and Infarct Size
On postischemia day 3, animals were anesthetized using a
mixture of ketamine and xylazine (80 and 12 mg/kg, respectively). Approximately 0.2 mL blood was collected from the
left ventricle of the heart. All blood samples were collected
before 12 pm. The animal was transcardially perfused with
PBS containing 5200 units/L heparin followed by 4% paraformaldehyde-0.1 M PBS. Brains were removed from the
skull and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-0.1 M PBS at
4°C overnight followed by 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose solution in PBS, each at 4°C overnight. Brains were embedded in
CryoGel (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), frozen on dry ice, and sectioned coronally on a cryostat (Leica
Microsystems Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL). Sections (40 µm) were
free floated in cryopreservative (25% glycerol, 25% ethylene
glycol, 50% 0.1 M PBS) and stored at −20°C until stained.
Serial sections throughout the brain with an interval of
760 µm were stained with 0.5% cresyl violet and imaged
with a ScanScope CS scanner (Aperio, Vista, CA) at 20×
magnification. Evaluation of infarct size was performed with
StereoInvestigator software (MBF Bioscience, Williston,
VT). The infarct area was defined as reduced Nissl staining
and necrosis with pyknotic nuclei. The area of contralateral
hemisphere and the undamaged ipsilateral hemisphere in
each section were measured with the Cavalieri Estimator
method using a grid spacing of 100 µm. The volume was
calculated as the section interval (760 µm) × sum of the
areas measured in the sampled sections. To calculate the
infarct size, an indirect method (50) was used to correct
for the confounding effect of brain edema. In brief, the
infarct volume is calculated as [V contralateral hemisphere

− V undamaged ipsilateral hemisphere]. Brain swelling was
defined as an increased volume of the infarcted hemisphere
(51,52) and expressed as a percentage of the contralateral
hemisphere: (V ipsilateral hemisphere − V contralateral
hemisphere)/V contralateral hemisphere ×100%.
Immunohistochemistry
Brain sections containing the infarct areas were used
for immunohistochemistry as described previously (53).
The primary antibodies were a combination of a monoclonal mouse anti-NeuN antibody (EMD Millipore, Billerica,
Massachusetts) and a polyclonal rabbit antiglial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP, Abcam) antibody. To assess the extent
of astrocytic infiltration, four identical regions of interest
(ROIs) were draw at the cortical penumbra area based on
the NeuN staining (Figure 4A). Each ROI was a 200 × 200
µm square. In the same image, mean density of GFAP staining from four ROIs was averaged for the section and then
data from multiple sections were averaged for each animal.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
The whole blood collected at sacrifice was allowed to
clot at room temperature for ~30 minutes, and serum was
collected by centrifugation at 2,500g for 20 minutes at 4°C.
Sera were stored at −80°C until used. Serum levels of IGF-1
were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(R&D) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Statistics
Data were analyzed using Sigma-Stat 3.5 software (Systat
Software, Chicago, Illinois). Western blotting results were
analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The
vascular responses to endothelin were analyzed by two-way
repeated measures ANOVA (using group and endothelin-1
concentration as independent variables) followed by the
Student–Newman–Keuls test. Because normality tests on
infarct volume failed, nonparametric tests were used. To
assess the effect of genotype on infarct size, a rank sum
test was used to compare the dw/dw+sal to the HZ group.
To determine the effect of GH treatment, the same test was
performed between the dw/dw+sal and dw/dw+GH groups.
Brain edema was analyzed using ANOVA on ranks followed
by the Dunn’s method. The GFAP density was analyzed by
one-way ANOVA followed by the Student–Newman–Keuls
method. All results are presented as mean ± SEM.

(Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA). An incision was made
to expose the skull. A hole with a diameter of 1 mm was
made (A-P: +0.2 mm, L-VL: +4.0 mm) using a dental burr.
Endothelin-1 (120 pmol, Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) in 3
µL saline was injected with a 30 G needle attached to a
Hamilton syringe (Reno, NV) at a depth of 9.2 mm. The
coordinates for the injection were determined based on the
rat brain atlas (49). Empirical adjustments were made for
variations in the Lewis strain and verified visually in pilot
studies by an injection of 3 µL 0.1% Evans blue solution.
The endothelin-1 solution was injected at 0.1 µL/15 seconds and the needle remained in situ for 3 minutes before
retraction. The bone was filled with sterile bone wax and
the wound was closed with 4-0 silk suture. After receiving
a topical application of bupivacaine (Vedco Inc., St Joseph,
MO) and a subcutaneous injection of 2.5 mg enrofloxacin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Loius, MO [other chemicals, if not specified, are from the same source]), the animals were allowed
to recover from anesthesia and returned to their home cage.
Body temperature was monitored throughout the procedure
and maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C with a heating pad. Animals
were monitored postoperatively for signs of stress.

lumen occlusion was reached at 100 nM in both groups. No
differences in endothelin-induced MCA constriction were
evident between the dw/dw and HZ groups (Figure  1D),
supporting the validity of our experimental model.

GH/IGF-1 Deficiency Does Not Alter Expression of
Endothelin Receptors
Western blots demonstrated that ETAR protein levels were
similar among the three treatment groups (Figure 1B and C,
p = .389). The expression of ETBR was too low to be reliably
quantitated but appeared to be similar among groups.

Effect of GH/IGF-1 Deficiency on Ischemic Infarct Size
in Response to by Endothelin-1
Perivascular endothelin injection produced substantial
infarcts in all three groups. We chose to calculate infarct
size using the indirect method by subtracting the volume
of noninfarct region in the ipsilateral hemisphere from the
total volume of the contralateral hemisphere. Using this
method, the values of infarct volume were substantially
smaller than that calculated by directly measuring the volume of infarct (data not shown), indicating that the direct
method overestimated infarct size due to ischemia-caused
edema. As shown in Figure 2, the infarct volume was not
statistically different among the three groups (p = .571).

GH/IGF-1 Deficiency Does Not Alter Endothelin1-Induced Constriction of Isolated Middle Cerebral

groups (p < .001) and pairwise comparisons demonstrate that the serum IGF-1 level in the dw/dw+sal group is significantly reduced compared to the HZ group
(p < .001) and growth hormone–treated group (p < .001). Homogenates of cerebral cortex from a separate cohort was used for Western blotting to semiquantify the
expression of A-type (ETAR) and B-type (ETBR) receptors. Representative images are shown in (B) and quantitation of ETAR expression is shown in (C). One-way

the heterozygous littermates (502.3 ± 30.9 vs 1035.6 ±
34.8 ng/mL, respectively, p < .001). Treatment with GH
restored IGF-1 levels to those found in normal animals
(1012.7 ± 58.0 ng/mL, p < .001, Figure 1A).

Nevertheless, the HZ group demonstrated a trend towards
increased infarct size as compared to the dw/dw+sal group
(p = .253). Importantly, replacement of GH at levels that
induced complete restoration of circulating IGF-1 levels did
not modify infarct size.
Effect of GH/IGF-1 Deficiency on Brain Edema After
Ischemia
Endothelin-induced ischemia resulted in increased volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere in the HZ animals (8.0%
± 2.4%) and dw/dw+GH groups (7.0% ± 2.1%). Images at
higher magnifications (Figure  3A) demonstrate reduced
cell density in the ipsilateral compared with the contralateral hemisphere. Based on the morphological changes of
increased tissue volume and reduced cell density, we conclude that the change in brain volume is a result of and a
surrogate for brain edema. One-way ANOVA on ranks indicated that significant differences in brain edema occurred
among the three groups (p = .004). Pairwise multiple

comparisons indicated that the dw/dw+sal group (0.6% ±
0.4%) had significantly reduced edema compared with the
other two groups (Figure 3B, p < .05 for both dw/dw+sal vs
dw/dw+GH and dw/dw+sal vs HZ).
Effect of GH/IGF-1 Deficiency on Astrocytic Activation
After Ischemia
Three days after endothelin-induced ischemia, all three
treatment groups exhibited profound GFAP staining indicating astrocytic activation. NeuN staining revealed a clear
delineation between the infarcted and viable tissue. By
costaining with GFAP, the glia scar, composed of activated
astrocytes, was visible in the areas surrounding the infarct
(Figure 4C). The dw/dw+sal group showed reduced expansion/infiltration of activated astrocytes into the NeuN+ area
in the cortex as compared to the other two groups. Intensity
of GFAP staining at the cortical penumbra region was significantly lower in the dw/dw+sal group as compared to the
other two groups (p < .05, Figure 4D).

Discussion
Ischemic stroke, which accounts for 87% of all strokes,
is a major cause of mortality and the leading cause of
long-term disability in the elderly in the United States
(1). Population-based studies show that age is the most
important independent risk factor for stroke, with stroke
rates doubling every decade after the age of 55 years (1,3).
Aging not only increases the incidence of stroke, but also
increases severity of stroke and impairs recovery. It is well
established that aging is associated with reductions in circulating GH and IGF-1 levels. Our results demonstrate that a
peripubertal-onset of circulating GH and IGF-1 deficiency
is associated with complex effects on stroke volume and
the cellular changes in the brain that occur in response to
stroke. Deficiency of GH/IGF-1 does not significantly affect
infarct size but substantially reduces ischemia-induced
brain edema and astrocytic infiltration.
In our study, we elected to use the Lewis dwarf (dw/
dw) rats, which exhibit deficiencies in circulating GH/
IGF-1 early in life, thereby mimicking the GH/IGF-1
reductions that occur during aging without having to age
the animals and introduce additional confounding agerelated factors. Ischemia was induced by microinjection of a potent vasoconstrictor into the proximity of the
MCA. Hence, it was critical to ensure that the vasoconstriction produced by endothelin-1 was equivalent in the
treatment groups. Analysis of the protein expression of
ETAR and ETBR in the cortex and striatum demonstrated
that changes in circulating IGF-1 levels did not modify
the expression of these receptors. Ex vivo assessment of
vessel constriction verified that MCAs derived from dw/
dw and HZ rats respond to endothelin-1 similarly. These

data validated the animal model and ischemic model
used in this study.
It is generally accepted that the increased cerebrovascular risk that occurs with lower levels of GH/IGF-1 is
responsible for the association between short stature and
increased incidence of stroke (19,20). In addition, numerous studies support the concept that age-related decreases
in levels of circulating GH and IGF-1 have an impact on the
pathophysiology of cerebral vasculature. Circulating GH/
IGF-1 levels dramatically decrease after stroke (54–56),
lower circulating GH/IGF-1 is associated with poor recovery (56–59), and GH/IGF-1 treatment has been reported to
be neuroprotective (23,60). However, the majority of the
studies regarding the effects of GH/IGF-1 on stroke are
focused on poststroke treatment for improved recovery.
Only a few studies have concentrated on the association of
stroke with endogenous GH/IGF-1 levels and the data that
are available are controversial. Earlier studies indicate that
Lewis dwarf rats exhibit increased incidence of late-life
cerebral hemorrhage and peripubertal GH replacement
reduces the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke and extends
life span (30). Neuronal knockout of the IGF-1 receptor
exacerbates hypoxia/ischemia-induced brain injury in
neonatal mice (61). Recent studies on mice with adultonset circulating IGF-1 deficiency also show an increased
prevalence of hypertension-induced cerebral hemorrhages
(Z. Ungvari and P. Toth, unpublished data, 2014). In contrast, mice with neonatal-onset IGF-1 deficiency were protected from embolic ischemia compared to their wildtype
littermates, and adult normal 129/SV mice with chronic
IGF-1 treatment exhibited increased brain infarct size
after MCA occlusion (62). In the current study, infarct size

was not statistically different among groups even though
the dw/dw+sal group showed a tendency of reduced infarct
volume compared with the HZ control. This is potentially
the results of the relatively small sample size especially in
the dw/dw+sal and dw/dw+GH groups, given the fact that
brain ischemic damage often exhibits substantial variance
in animal models. Nevertheless, our data revealed that
deficiency of circulating GH/IGF-1 levels in Lewis dwarf
rats reduces ischemia-induced brain edema and astrocytic
infiltration. The mechanisms by which circulating levels
of GH and IGF-1 influence the development and clinical
outcome of stroke are likely multifaceted (55,63–65), and
involve vasoprotective effects, effects on clot formation,
neuronal protection, oxidative stress, as well as effects on
astrocytes.

Abundant in vitro (66) and in vivo evidence suggest that
GH and IGF-1 have neuroprotective properties, promoting
cell growth and proliferation while suppressing apoptosis,
oxidative stress, and inflammation (see Refs. (67–70)).
Because of the pleiotropic actions of GH and IGF-1, these
hormones are likely to have effects on vasculature, astrocytes, and neurons, which independently or collectively
influence stroke outcomes. This was apparent in this study
because effects were observed on diverse endpoints.
Based on the current literature and the results of our studies, GH/IGF-1 appears to have differential effects on hemorrhagic versus acute ischemic stroke. These hormones protect
the cerebrovasculature and prevent hypertension-induced
vascular injury, whereas deficiency of these hormones exacerbates vascular damage contributing to hemorrhagic stroke

Their colocalization is presented in the merged image (C). Four evenly spaced, square identical regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn to outline the cortical penumbra according to
NeuN staining, and the mean intensity of GFAP staining in 4 ROIs were averaged for each section, and further averaged among sections for each animal. In the dw/
dw+sal group, GFAP staining was restricted in a smaller area than the NeuN staining and thus has a lower GFAP intensity in the ROIs; in contrast, in the other two
groups, GFAP+ staining was either aligned with NeuN+ staining or invaded towards the infarct core (NeuN− area) and therefore has higher intensity in the ROIs (D).

barrier and neural repair, further studies are warranted
to determine the long-term functional consequences of
decreased astrocytosis in GH/IGF-1 deficiency.
In conclusion, GH/IGF-1 deficiency does not significantly alter infarct size after endothelin-1-induced
focal cerebral ischemia but significantly attenuates other
ischemic parameters including edema and astrocytic infiltration. Because GH treatment initiated after endothelin1-induced focal cerebral ischemia in rats was reported to
accelerate recovery of motor function and significantly
improves spatial memory on the Morris water maze test
(23), further studies are warranted to determine the specific
mechanisms for the actions of GH/IGF-1 that contribute
to functional recovery. Finally, because the vasculature
appears to be a primary target of the GH/IGF-1 axis and
there are data suggesting that GH/IGF-1 deficiency may
affect vascular fragility (81), the effects of GH/IGF-1 deficiency on the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic stroke should
be elucidated.

(Ungvari and Toth, unpublished data, 2014). However, in
ischemic stroke, higher levels of GH/IGF-1 appear to have
pleiotropic actions. There is increasing evidence that in
humans lower IGF-1 levels are significantly related to risk
of acute ischemic stroke (71). Moreover, GH and IGF-1
treatments were shown to protect neurons against hypoxiainduced damage (60,72–75). Nevertheless, the effect of GH/
IGF-1 deficiency on infarct volume in the Lewis dwarf rat
model used was not significant. The specific mechanisms
underlying these differential effects are presently unclear.
The direct actions of GH/IGF-1 on neuronal cells may be
related to both increased cellular metabolism and antiapoptotic effects, which are well-known actions of both GH and
IGF-1. Interestingly, the effects of GH/IGF-1 deficiency on
edema and astrocytic infiltration were highly significant and
suggest that these processes are important contributing factors in the clinical sequelae after ischemic stroke.
Cerebral edema is an important complication that forms
in the early hours of ischemic stroke by processes involving increased transport of water from the blood into brain.
It is followed by vasogenic edema caused by breakdown
of the blood–brain barrier ~4 hours after the ischemia. So
far, there have been a few studies related to the effects of
IGF-1 on ischemia-induced brain edema. Blunting IGF-1
receptor action in neuronal precursors and their progeny
was reported to exacerbate hypoxic/ischemic-induced brain
swelling/edema in mice(61), suggesting that the IGF-1 axis
might be protective on cerebral edema. In the Lewis model,
circulating GH and IGF-1 are present during before and after
the stroke in HZ and dw/dw rats replaced with GH. In contrast, we found that circulating GH and IGF-1 deficiencies
in Lewis dwarf rats were associated with decreased cerebral
edema on postischemic day 3. Even though GH treatment
is known to stimulate water retention in the body, its effect
on water/salt balance has rarely been studied, especially in
the context of cerebral ischemic injury. Yamamura and colleagues (76) reported that GH treatment on Wistar rats did
not exacerbate brain edema caused by freeze brain injury.
However, whether GH deficiency could attenuate edema in
the same situation was not assessed. Our findings that GH
deficiency in the dwarf rats is associated with reduced brain
edema after ischemic stroke add important information to
our knowledge on the role of GH/IGF-1 in ischemic brain
injury. .
Reactive astrogliosis is a universal response of astrocytes
to brain injury induced by ischemia, which involves rapid
proliferation and changes in the cellular phenotype (77).
Here, we report that postischemic reactive astrocytosis is
reduced in Lewis dwarf rats and increased by GH replacement. This finding can be expected on the basis of earlier
findings that IGF-1 regulates astrocyte proliferation both
in vitro (78) and in vivo (79). Furthermore, mice overexpressing GH have increased GFAP levels in the brain (80).
Because reactive astrocytes are critical for the regulation
of inflammatory processes, maintenance of the blood–brain
