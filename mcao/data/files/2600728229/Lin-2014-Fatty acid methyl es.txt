Abstract We previously showed that palmitic acid methyl ester
(PAME) and stearic acid methyl ester (SAME) are simultaneously released from the sympathetic ganglion and PAME possesses
potent vasodilatory properties which may be important in cerebral ischemia. Since PAME is a potent vasodilator simultaneously released with SAME, our hypothesis was that PAME/SAME
confers neuroprotection in rat models of focal/global cerebral
ischemia. We also examined the neuroprotective properties of
Solutol HS15, a clinically approved excipient because it possesses similar fatty acid compositions as PAME/SAME.
Asphyxial cardiac arrest (ACA, 6 min) was performed 30 min
after PAME/SAME treatment (0.02 mg/kg, IV). Solutol HS15
(2 ml/kg, IP) was injected chronically for 14 days (once daily).
Histopathology of hippocampal CA1 neurons was assessed
7 days after ACA. For focal ischemia experiments, PAME,
SAME, or Solutol HS15 was administered following reperfusion
after 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). 2,3,5Triphenyltetrazolium staining of the brain was performed 24 h
after MCAO and the infarct volume was quantified. Following
ACA, the number of surviving hippocampal neurons was enhanced by PAME-treated (68 %), SAME-treated (69 %), and
Solutol-treated HS15 (68 %) rats as compared to ACA onlytreated groups. Infarct volume was decreased by PAME (83 %),
SAME (68 %), and Solutol HS15 (78 %) as compared to saline
(vehicle) in MCAO-treated animals. PAME, SAME, and
Solutol HS15 provide robust neuroprotection in both paradigms of ischemia. This may prove therapeutically beneficial
since Solutol HS15 is already administered as a solublizing

Introduction
We previously showed that palmitic acid methyl ester (PAME)
and stearic acid methyl ester (SAME) are simultaneously
released upon chemical and electrical depolarization from
the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) of the rat. Exogenous
and endogenous application of PAME but not SAME-induced
potent rabbit aortic vasodilation (EC50 =0.19 nM) and is 3,000
times more potent than some nitric oxide (NO) donors [1].
Since the vast majority of vasodilators [i.e., NO, calcitonin
gene-related peptide (CGRP), vasoactive intestinal peptide,
and carbon monoxide] can exert intrinsic neuroprotection
[2–7], we sought to investigate the possible neuroprotective
effects of exogenous PAME and SAME in focal (middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with 2 min of reperfusion)
and global (6 min of asphyxial cardiac arrest, ACA) cerebral
ischemia models. These two models of ischemia were selected
to determine (1) delayed (7 days after ACA) neuronal cell
death in the hippocampus as it is well documented in the CA1
region of the hippocampus after ACA [8] and (2) observe
brain infarct volume acutely 24 h in a stroke model (MCAOfocal cerebral ischemia) [9, 10]. Since SAME is an 18-carbon
fatty acid, we also investigated the effects of Solutol HS 15
(polyoxyethylene glycol of 12-hydroxystearic acid), a highly
soluble/stable in aqueous solution with low toxicity non-ionic
solubilizer and emulsifying agent, that is clinically used to

110

solubilize drugs such as: various vitamins, propanidid, miconazole, alfadolone, alfaxalone, nifedipine, and piroxicam; none
of which are currently approved for the treatment of stroke or
cerebral ischemia. Currently in the USA, Solutol HS 15 is
approved for oral consumption but has been marketed as an
injectable drug product in Canada and Argentina [11].
Previous reports have suggested that fatty acids may provide
robust neuroprotection after MCAO in rats [12–15]. We show
that PAME, a potent vasodilator and SAME can provide
neuroprotection against focal and global cerebral ischemia. Since
SAME provides neuroprotection, we also tested Solutol HS 15, a
structurally similar fatty acid as a possible neuroprotective agent.
Our hypothesis was that similar to PAME and SAME, Solutol
HS 15 can also confer neuroprotection in the rat in vivo. We
show that pre- and post-treatment of Solutol HS 15 confers
neuroprotection in models of focal and global cerebral ischemia.
Given the low toxicity of this drug, as attested by numerous
clinical trials and possible clinical efficacy of Solutol HS 15 as a
neuroprotective agent against cerebral ischemia, Solutol HS 15
could reach clinical trials for stroke in the near future.

Methods
Chemicals Solutol HS 15 (BASF Corp., Florham Park, NJ,
USA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were dissolved in
sterile saline (0.9 % NaCl). Six hundred microliters of Solutol
HS 15 was heated to 37 °C and dissolved in 1.4 mL of sterile
saline to achieve 2 ml/kg [16] injected (IV bolus or IP, daily
for 14 days) into the rat used in MCAO and ACA models of
ischemia. PAME and SAME were dissolved in 100 % ethanol
and diluted with sterile saline injected bolus IV (0.005 % final
ethanol concentration of PAME and SAME) for ACA model
of cerebral ischemia. 0.005 % ethanol was used as a vehicle
(control). For MCAO studies, PAME, SAME, and 12hydroxystearic acid (used as a negative control for MCAO
studies, 12-HS) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was
dissolved in 100 % DMSO and diluted with sterile saline to
achieve a concentration of 0.02 mg/kg. DMSO alone was used
as vehicle control. Overall, 0.01 % DMSO was injected into
all groups with the exception of Solutol HS 15. Saline groups
were injected with 0.9 % NaCl with a final volume of 2 mL.
We used 0.02 mg/kg of PAME, SAME, and 12-HS in all of
our studies. This was based on the fact that PAME produces
maximum rabbit aortic vasorelaxation at 1 μM ex vivo [1].
Therefore, we hypothesized that utilizing 1 μM (This translates
to 0.02 mg/kg in vivo in the 300-g rat) of PAME, SAME, or 12HS can evoke neuroprotection in both ischemia animal models.
Additionally, the dosages for PAME and SAME were derived
from our in vivo two-photon laser scanning microscopy
(TPLSM) pial circulation studies (Fig. 2e) suggesting that
PAME (0.02 mg/kg) can enhance cerebral blood flow (CBF)
24 h after ACA. This was a starting point since we are the first

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:109–117

to administer PAME or SAME in vivo. We administered the 18carbon fatty acid, 12-HS, as a negative control for PAME/
SAME and Solutol HS 15. Therefore, the same concentration
was used for 12-HS as with PAME/SAME. Dosage for Solutol
HS 15 was determined according to manufacturer's instructions as a novel excipient. Derived from previous studies [16],
Solutol HS 15 was administered at 30 (Solutol HS 15)/70
(saline) (v/v) injected in 2 ml/kg (or 600 μl of solution
containing Solutol HS 15 and saline, 30:70).
Animal Preparation All procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (University of
Miami, Miller School of Medicine). Adult male Sprague–
Dawley rats (250–350 g) were fasted overnight before surgery. Rats were anesthetized with 4 % isoflurane and 30:70
mixture of O2 and N2O, followed by endotracheal intubation.
Isoflurane was lowered to 1.5–2 % for endovascular access.
The femoral vein and artery were cannulated using a singlelumen (PE-50) catheter for blood pressure monitoring, blood
gas analysis, and intravenous (IV) injection of pharmacological
agents. Head and body temperatures were maintained at 37 °C
using heating blankets or lamps during the entire procedure in
the presence or absence of ischemia. For physiological parameters for both global and focal ischemia models, please refer to
Tables 1, 2, and 3.
Asphyxial Cardiac Arrest To induce ACA, apnea was induced
by disconnecting the ventilator from the endotracheal tube. Six
minutes after asphyxia, resuscitation was initiated by administering a bolus injection of epinephrine (0.005 mg/kg, IV) and
sodium bicarbonate (1 meq/kg, IV) followed by mechanical
ventilation with 100 % O2 to achieve return to spontaneous
circulation (ROSC) [8]. Arterial blood gases were measured
before and after ACA. Control animals (sham) were subjected
to surgical procedures similar to ACA animals except without
induction of ACA. Resuscitation drugs were not used; however,
sham animals were treated with isoflurane similar to experimental animals. The rats were immobilized with vecuronium
bromide (2.0 mg/kg, IV, administered every 10 min) and
maintained immobilized throughout the procedure [8].
Two-Photon Laser Scanning Microscopy For detail methods
of the thinned-skull method and the detection of CBF via
TPLSM, please see Lin et al. [8, 17]. Briefly, the animal was
anaesthetized and cannulated (femoral artery and vein). An
incision was made at the midline of the scalp. Utilizing a highspeed micro-drill, a thin circular area of the skull (approximately
∼2 mm in diameter) was made 1 mm from bregma. The skull is
thin enough for visualization of blood vessels via 2-PM when it
is approximately half the thickness of the skull or approximately
0.5 mm [18]. After thinning the skull, the rat was placed on a
TPLSM (Lasersharp2000, BioRad, Hercules, CA) with a ×20
water immersion objective (Olympus XLUMPlanFl) lowered to

and 24 h after ACA (Fig. 2d). PAME or SAME was introduced
IVat 0.2 mg/kg 30 min before ACA. Linescan images were used
to calculate CBF. For more details, please see Lin et al. [8, 17].
Histopathology Seven days after ACA, rats were re-anesthetized
with 4 % isoflurane and perfused from the ascending aorta
with physiologic saline (2 min), following a mixture of 40 %
formaldehyde, glacial acetic acid, and methanol (FAM) for
18 min and the head immersed in FAM at 4 °C (24 h). Rat
brains were removed from the skull, embedded in paraffin, and
coronal sequential sections (10 μm thickness) from the brain
were made and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. CA1
hippocampal sections were visualized at ×40 magnification.

Ischemic neurons were manually counted by a blinded operator at 18 fields/section along the medial to lateral extent of the
CA1 region of the hippocampus 3.8 mm posterior to the

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Animals were prepared as
described above (see “Animal Preparation” section). Animals
were intubated and anesthesia was applied. Rats were
immobilized with pancuronium bromide (0.75 mg/kg, IV).
Focal ischemia was induced in rats using an occluding
intraluminal suture. A coated (with poly-D-lysine) 30-mmlong segment of 3-0 nylon monofilament suture with the tip
rounded by a flame was inserted into the stump of the external
carotid artery and advanced into the internal carotid artery
∼19–20 mm from the carotid bifurcation to occlude the ostium
of the MCA for 2 h with 2 min of reperfusion. Then, Solutol

HS 15, PAME, SAME, or 12-HS were introduced IV. The
intraluminal suture was left in place for 2 h and the sites of
incisions (neck and femoral region for arterial and vein access)
were sutured after 2 min and reperfusion of drugs allowing the
animal to recover (removal of intubation tube). Two hours, the
rats were re-anesthetized via mask with 1.5–2 % isoflurane in
the absence of pancuronium bromide. The intraluminal suture
was removed and the animals were allowed to recover for
24 h. Rats were sacrificed with 5 % isoflurane and 100 %
nitrous oxide after 24 h of reperfusion. The brain was quickly
removed and sliced (2 mm thick) in preparation for the 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining [9, 10].
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride Staining Rats were sacrificed 24 h after reperfusion. Brains were removed, placed
in a brain matrix, and sliced into 2-mm coronal sections,
resulting in six brain slices stained with 2 % TTC. The brain
slices were scanned on a flat-bed scanner for infarct assessment
shown in white. Relative stroke area (ratio of infarct size
relative to the ipsilateral hemisphere, corrected for edema via
comparison of the contralateral hemisphere) was measured
(via Image J software) [20] to assess infarct size from the six
slices derived from each brain [9, 10].
Exclusion Criteria MCAO Model of Focal Ischemia: Excluded from the MCAO studies were rats that experience convulsions or prolonged disturbances of consciousness. Additionally, subarachnoid hemorrhage due to suture-induced arterial
rupture was also excluded. In the present study, four animals
were excluded from these studies.
ACA Model of Global Ischemia: No animals were excluded
with no mortality due to the fact that 6 min of ACA is a mild to
moderate model of global ischemia. Occasionally, on average,
1 out of 10 animals will be excluded due to the fact that the
animal did not survive the ACA upon cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Cause of death after cardiopulmonary resuscitation is

almost always due to pulmonary edema by too much chest
compression pressure by the operator.
Statistical Analysis Results were expressed as means±S.E.M.
Statistical analysis was evaluated by one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey's post hoc test as appropriate with SPSS
statistical software (Chicago, IL). The p≤0.05 level of probability was accepted as significant.

Results
PAME, SAME, and Solutol HS 15 after Global Cerebral
Ischemia
Our first hypothesis is that PAME, SAME, and Solutol HS 15
can confer neuroprotection after global (6-min ACA) cerebral
ischemia (Fig. 1a, b). PAME (1,143±39.3 normal neurons) or
SAME (1,188±57.8 normal neurons) pretreated 30 min before ACA (6 min) conferred neuroprotection in the CA1
region of the hippocampus 7 days after ACA as compared to
no drug treatment (ACA only) or vehicle (ethanol 0.005 %;
Fig. 2). Since SAME is an 18 carbon fatty acid, we investigated the possible neuroprotective effects of Solutol HS 15,
which is a polyoxyethylene glycol (PEG) of 12-HS similar in
structure to SAME with the exception of an additional
methoxy group at C1 and hydroxyl group at C12.
Since Solutol HS 15 is an excipient that is often administered
chronically (i.e., nifedipine and miconazole), we surmised that
chronic pretreatment would afford neuroprotection against
ACA. We thus, pretreated rats with Solutol HS 15 (2 ml/kg,
IP) for 14 days before ACA. This treatment provided robust
neuroprotection in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus
7 days after ACA. Rats pretreated with Solutol HS 15 in the
presence of ACA presented with 1,130±60 normal neurons,

and Solutol HS 15 (2 ml/kg) provide neuroprotection in the CA1 region of
the rat hippocampus 7 days after ACA. Rats were pretreated with PAME/
SAME (IV bolus 30 min before ACA) and Solutol HS 15 (IP, once daily
for 14 days before 6 min of ACA). Sham (no ischemia), no drug (ACA
only), and ethanol (vehicle control) groups were performed as internal
controls. Neurons from the CA1 region of the hippocampus were counted
and expressed in the bar graph shown in a. Numerical values in the bar
graph represent the number of normal neurons counted. Numbers in
parentheses indicate the number of animals used per group. Representative

images of the CA1 region of the hippocampus are shown in b–c. Arrows
represent typical neuronal cell death in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Short horizontal solid bars represent 30 μm in length in the field of

similar to the sham-operated group (1,125±41.5 normal neurons) (Figs. 2a–c). In contrast, rats without drug treatment
(ACA only) presented with only 363±15 normal neurons,
indicating that 6 min of ACA produced significant neuronal
damage. Additionally, rats pretreated with PAME but not
SAME (Figs. 2d, e) enhanced CBF 24 h (almost three times
more as compared to control) after ACA measuring cortical
vessel red blood cells via TPLSM. Physiological parameters
such as body weight, pH, PCO2, PO2 MABP, and blood glucose were measured (Tables 1 and 2) to ensure consistency of
the animals within and between groups. For a two-dimensional
structure of the fatty acids, please see Fig. 1d.

against ACA in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, we investigated the effects of these fatty acid-mediated neuroprotection

Infarct Volume (mm3)

PAME, SAME, and Solutol HS 15 all can provide neuroprotection in rat models of global and focal cerebral ischemia,
with a reduction in neuronal cell death in the CA1 region of
the hippocampus [8] (7 days after ACA—delayed cell death)
and this led to the utilization of the MCAO method to detect
brain infarct volume acutely 24 h after MCAO (focal
ischemia) [9, 10] as a model for stroke resulting in overall
neuroprotection of the brain as observed using TTC staining.
Additionally, pretreatment with PAME but not SAME can
enhance CBF 24 h after ACA.
Stearic acid can provide neuroprotection against oxidative
stress and oxygen/glucose deprivation in rat cortical/
hippocampal slices [21, 22]. However, the esterified form of
stearic acid (stearic acid methyl ester) has not been wellexplored. Since SAME provides neuroprotection in both
models of ischemia (global and focal), this led to further
investigations into Solutol HS 15, a clinically used excipient
that consists of PEG of 12-HS, similar in structure to SAME
[23]. As a negative control, we administered 12-HS in a similar
fashion as other drugs/vehicles tested (Fig. 3). Neuronal damage
was similar to that of DMSO/saline suggesting no protective
effects of 12-HS alone, but the PEG of 12-HS may be crucial in
providing neuroprotection. The mechanism of action of Solutol
HS 15-induced neuroprotection is unknown, but PEG alone can
stabilize and mechanically repair cell membranes in traumatic
brain injury models [24, 25]. Interestingly, PEG is also thought
to enter the cytosol and restructure reactive oxygen species/free
radical-induced damaged mitochondria plasmalemma [26] leading to neuroprotection [27]. Unlike PEG, 12-HS alone did not
elicit neuroprotection (present data). It is conceivable that this
combined structure moiety is the key to eliciting
neuroprotection due to neuronal cell membrane stabilization.
Additionally, it is also important to note that PEG was administered at 1 ml IV injection of sterile saline with 30 % by volume
of PEG to achieve PEG-saline solution similar to our studies.
However, the PEG used had a MW of 2,000 unlike Solutol
HS15 (MW=1,000). This discrepancy in molecular weight and
structure could explain the possible differences in our results
[24–26, 28].
There are examples of excipients (solvents) that may have
therapeutic effects such as DMSO, which has been shown to
be neuroprotective (>0.1 % DMSO) against cerebral ischemia

Saline DMSO 12-HS Solutol SAME PAME

Fig. 3 Post-treatment with PAME, SAME, or Solutol HS 15 after 2 h of
MCAO decreases total rat brain infarct volume. Post-treatment with
PAME (0.02 mg/kg, IV), SAME (0.02 mg/kg, IV), or Solutol HS 15
(2 ml/kg, IV) decreased ipsilateral hemisphere volume as compared to
saline (vehicle for Solutol HS 15), DMSO [partial vehicle for (12-HS),
PAME, or SAME], and 12-HS (negative control). TTC-treated brain
slices were scanned and analyzed (Image J software) at the ipsilateral
hemisphere. The percent of brain infarct volume is depicted in white and
tabulated in panel a and the total brain infarct volume (expressed in mm3)
is presented in b. Representative images are shown below each bar graph
corresponding to their relative drug treatment (a) (n=6–8, * p≤0.05)

[29]. However, these studies incorporate only 0.01 % DMSO,
which have been shown to be ineffective in providing
neuroprotection. In both ischemia models, using low quantities of either ethanol or DMSO resulted in no measurable
effects of neuroprotection.
Since PAME (hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, a 16-carbon
chain fatty acid) is a potent vasodilator, it is highly likely that

116

PAME's neuroprotective properties are derived from the revival of CBF in otherwise ischemia-induced depression of
CBF exacerbating neuronal damage. Like other vasodilators
such as CGRP and NO, the depression of CBF can cause
neuronal damage possibly reversed with PAME or other vasodilators (i.e., NO or CGRP). Cortical CBF was not measured
in the MCAO model due to the technical complexity with the
focal ischemia technique coupled with intravital TPLSM. Consistent with our previous findings [1], our results suggest that
PAME, but not SAME (18-carbon fatty acid) can cause vasodilation to enhance CBF after global ischemia (asphyxial cardiac arrest) (Fig. 2d, e). Since SAME, an 18-carbon fatty acid, did
not cause vasodilation/constriction nor changes in CBF, we did
not pursue this study further with similar 18-carbon fatty acids,
Solutol HS15 or 12-HS. Our results suggest that PAME, but not
SAME, has vasodilatory actions (from previous studies) in vivo
and in vitro resulting in enhanced brain perfusion after ischemia
(Figs. 2d, e). Besides enhanced perfusion (i.e., vasodilatory
actions of PAME), the neuroprotective actions of PAME can
be attributed to its' inherent anti-inflammatory properties during
cellular stress [30, 31]. However, the role of SAME-induced
neuroprotection (not a vasodilator) [1] remains unknown. Interestingly, SAME is released at twice the concentration as compared to PAME upon depolarization of the SCG [1]. The exact
mechanism of SAME-induced neuroprotection needs further
investigation but may be similar to Solutol HS 15 by stabilizing
cellular membranes under conditions of stress [24–28].
The concentration of PAME and SAME used in this study
were entirely based on previous studies of PAME-induced
aortic vasodilation of 1 μM in vitro [1]. This was extrapolated
to the in vivo models of global (PAME/SAME pretreatment)
and focal (PAME/SAME post-treatment) ischemia. Acute/
chronic pre- and post-treatments of PAME and SAME in both
models of ischemia need to be further investigated. Similar
experimental paradigms can be implemented to further define
the role of Solutol HS 15. With well-defined fatty acid concentrations and time-points of administration, this strategy
may be able to define fatty acids as a therapeutically viable
option in the treatment against stroke and/or brain ischemia.
Global (ACA) cerebral ischemia was used as a model to
study delayed-neuronal cell death (7 days after ischemia) of
hippocampal CA1 neurons as they are highly susceptible to
cell death under global ischemic conditions as previously
shown [10, 17]. Aside from the fact that the ACA model of
global ischemia is more clinically relevant than other global
ischemia paradigms [8] (i.e., 2 or 4 vessel occlusion), global
ischemia can also affect the parenchyma [32] known to affect
cell survival in other regions of the brain including hippocampal CA1 neurons [33]. Therefore, we used the MCAO
model (focal ischemia) of stroke coupled with TTC staining
of the rat brain 24 h after ischemia to determine total infarct
volume of the brain. The use of both methods further
validates the effectiveness of PAME-, SAME-, and Solutol

HS 15-induced neuroprotection under global and focal ischemic conditions.
We show that PAME, SAME, and Solutol HS 15 can
provide neuroprotection in both models of cerebral ischemia.
PAME, SAME and Solutol HS 15 can provide hippocampal
CA1 neuroprotection and reduce brain infarction volume
(regional neuroprotection). Mechanistic insight of PAME,
SAME, and Solutol HS 15 may prove valuable in the near
future to counter the detrimental effects of cerebral ischemia
and/or stroke. Furthermore, neuroprotection studies involving
pharmacological agents that utilize Solutol HS 15 as an excipient should be used with caution as this may exert inaccurate measures of cell survival.
