Background: For stroke patients, stimulating neurorepair mechanisms is necessary to reduce
morbidity and disability. Our previous studies on brain and spinal cord trauma show that exogenous treatment with the S-nitrosylating agent S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) – a nitric oxide
and glutathione metabolite of the human body – stimulates neurorepair and aids functional
recovery. Using a rat model of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (IR) in this study, we tested
the hypothesis that GSNO invokes the neurorepair process and improves neurobehavioral functions through the angiogenic HIF-1α/VEGF pathway.
Methods: Stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 60 minutes followed by
reperfusion in adult male rats. The injured animals were treated with saline (IR group, n=7),
GSNO (0.25 mg/kg, GSNO group, n=7), and GSNO plus the HIF-1α inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) (0.25 mg/kg GSNO + 5.0 mg/kg 2-ME, GSNO + 2-ME group, n=7). The groups
were studied for either 7 or 14 days to determine neurorepair mediators and functional recovery.
Brain capillary endothelial cells were used to show that GSNO promotes angiogenesis and
that GSNO-mediated induction of VEGF and the stimulation of angiogenesis are dependent
on HIF-1α activity.
Results: IR injury increased the expression of neurorepair mediators HIF-1α, VEGF, and
PECAM-1 and vessel markers to a limited degree that correlate well with significantly compromised neurobehavioral functions compared with sham animals. GSNO treatment of IR not only
remarkably enhanced further the expression of HIF-1α, VEGF, and PECAM-1 but also improved
functioning compared with IR. The GSNO group also had a higher degree of vessel density than
the IR group. Increased expression of VEGF and the degree of tube formation (angiogenesis)
by GSNO were reduced after the inhibition of HIF-1α by 2-ME in an endothelial cell culture
model. 2-ME treatment of the GSNO group also blocked not only GSNO’s effect of reduced
infarct volume, decreased neuronal loss, and enhanced expression of PECAM-1 (P0.001),
but also its improvement of motor and neurological functions (P0.001).
Conclusion: GSNO stimulates the process of neurorepair, promotes angiogenesis, and aids
functional recovery through the HIF-1α-dependent pathway, showing therapeutic and translational promise for stroke.

neuronal death; however, even greater apoptotic neuronal
damage occurs hours and days later, caused by secondary
injury due to inflammation and oxidative stress.2 These secondary injury mechanisms hamper the neurorepair process,
leading to long-term chronic disabilities.3 Unfortunately,
proven effective therapy for neuroprotection/neurorepair
following stroke is presently not available, mainly because
of the biphasic (acute and chronic) nature of the disease
and limited understanding of the differential mechanisms
involved in these phases.4 For functional recovery, clinical
trials in human stroke show that neuroprotective drugs failed
due to the lack of efficacy in the chronic phase.5,6 Therefore,
an ideal therapy must ameliorate acute as well as chronic
phases of the injury by well-understood mechanisms.
Recently, we and others identified an S-nitrosylating
agent, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO),7,8 that provided robust
neurovascular protection and blood–brain barrier (BBB)
repair in a rat model of experimental stroke.7,9,10 This neurovascular protection was not associated with free nitric
oxide (NO) donors.11 Later, we observed that GSNO was
equally effective in aiding functional recovery in a rat model
of ischemia and reperfusion (IR),12 spinal cord injury,13
and traumatic brain injury,14,15 indicating that GSNO could
improve functional recovery following central nervous system injury. GSNO also improved learning and memory in
a rat model of cerebral hypoperfusion, a vascular dementia
model for experimental Alzheimer disease,16 suggesting
that GSNO’s activities are associated with motor as well as
cognitive function recovery. However, GSNO’s neurorepair mechanisms following central nervous system injury
are not understood. The term “neurorepair” refers to the
combination of neurochemical and cellular events, such as
stimulation of angiogenic mediators (eg, PECAM-1 and
vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) and formation
of vessels, leading to regenerative repair, neurorestoration,
and functional recovery. In this study, we investigated the
mechanisms of GSNO-mediated stimulation of the neurorepair process with a focus on the hypoxia-inducible factor-1
alpha (HIF-1α)/VEGF/angiogenesis pathway using a rat
model of experimental stroke.
GSNO directly regulates several angiogenic and neurorepair mediators, including stabilization of HIF-1α17 and induction of neurorepair mechanisms.12 S-nitrosylation-mediated
stabilization of HIF-1α has also been shown to protect against
myocardial injury via the VEGF/angiogenesis pathway in
GSNO reductase (GSNOR) knockout mice,18 indicating that
HIF-1 is a key player in the repair processes. These studies

provide a rationale for investigating S-nitrosylation-mediated
modulation of HIF-1α for neurorepair in stroke.
HIF-1 is a nuclear transcription factor characterized as
the master regulator of cellular oxygen homeostasis. HIF-1α
is rapidly upregulated in response to hypoxia and is rapidly
degraded upon reoxygenation/reperfusion.19 It activates the
tissue survival pathways by inducing several key enzymes
involved in cell metabolism (GLUT), angiogenesis (VEGF,
VEGFR1, angiopoietin), and free radical scavenging (heme
oxygenase-1 [HO-1]). HIF-1α knockout mice show impaired
vascular development and embryonic lethality, indicating
HIF-1’s protective role in vascular diseases.20 The HIF-1α
pathway is deeply involved in both pathological (hypoxia)
and neurorepair (normoxia) pathways following stroke.21 The
HIF-1α stabilizers/inducers, such as desferrioxamine (an iron
chelator approved for hemochromatosis treatment), promote
a number of survival pathways, including neuroprotection,
angiogenesis, and neurotrophins. These HIF-1α stabilizers
also reduce brain infarctions when administered pre- or
post-stroke.21 Prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitors, such as
FG-4539, are presently in a Phase II anemia trial because of
their activity to stabilize HIF-1α.22 However, inhibition of
HIF-1α under hypoxic/ischemic conditions in the acute phase
of IR injury has also been reported to be neuroprotective.22
Under normoxic conditions, studies are lacking on direct
stabilization of HIF-1α by secondary modification and the
induction of consequent protective genes. However, the
S-nitrosylation reaction has been shown to stabilize HIF-1
protein expression and activity in normoxic endothelial cells.23
It was also confirmed that, while GSNO stabilizes HIF-1α by
S-nitrosylation, reactive oxygen species (peroxynitrite, superoxide) destabilize it.24 The GSNO/S-nitrosylation-mediated
stabilization of HIF-1α has been shown to involve upstream
PI3K/Akt activity.25 GSNO also attenuates PHD activity during
normoxia and inhibits proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α.26
GSNO is a natural component of the human body produced by the reaction of NO with glutathione (GSH) in the
presence of oxygen.27 GSNO executes its action mainly via
S-nitrosylation of target proteins.28 Under physiological
conditions, GSNO and S-nitrosylated proteins are present in blood and brain.29–32 The concentration of GSNO in
adult rat brain tissue is estimated to be 6–8 μM.30 A study
on GSNO metabolism and its membrane crossing ability has been reported.33 Using an in vitro BBB model, we
have also reported GSNO crossing the cellular membrane.7
Studies have also reported that GSNO inhibits platelet
activation34 and protects both BBB integrity and epithelial

permeability.15,35 Similarly, exogenous administration of
GSNO36 also protects against cardiac ischemic injury,18,37
supporting the therapeutic potential of GSNO. Pharmacological inhibition of GSNOR has also been shown to improve
endothelial functions,38 indicating a protective role of GSNO
in neurovascular dysfunction-related diseases.
In this study, we demonstrate that GSNO-mediated
HIF-1α/VEGF/PECAM-1-dependent mechanisms stimulate
activation of angiogenesis-associated mediators, leading
to increased vessel density and improved neurobehavioral
functions during the delayed phases after IR. GSNO, via the
stabilization of HIF-1α, thereby confers improved long-term
outcomes with reduced IR injury and better functional recovery after stroke. The beneficial effects of GSNO are blocked
by the HIF-1α inhibitor 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME), thus
supporting the conclusion that GSNO-stimulated beneficial
effects are dependent on the activity of HIF-1α.

Methods
Reagents
GSNO was purchased from World Precision Instruments
(Sarasota, FL, USA). 2-ME and all other chemicals and
reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St Louis,
MO, USA), unless stated otherwise.

Animals and experimental design
Animals were male Sprague Dawley rats (n=121) weighing
250–290 g at the time of surgery. All animals received
humane care in compliance with the Medical University
of South Carolina (MUSC)’s guidelines and the National
Research Council’s criteria for humane care. Animal procedures were approved by the MUSC Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. The animals were allowed to acclimatize
for 3–5 days before the experiments. They were randomly
divided into four groups: 1) IR for 7 and 14 days (IR group);
2) IR + GSNO treatment for 7 and 14 days (GSNO group);
3) IR + GSNO + 2-ME (GSNO + 2-ME group) for 7 days; and
4) sham-operated control without treatment (Sham group)
for 14 days. The number of animals used in each experiment
is indicated in Figures 1–7.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) rat model and GSNO
treatment
Rats were anesthetized by ketamine hydrochloride (90 mg/kg
body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight)
administered intraperitoneally. Stroke was induced by

60-minute left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
using an intraluminal filament as previously described. 11
Regional cerebral blood flow was monitored during the
occlusion and early reperfusion to ensure the obstruction
of blood flow, as previously described.11,12 Reperfusion was
established by withdrawal of the filament. After 7 or 14
days, animals were sacrificed with an overdose of Nembutal.
The brain, including the peri-infarct region, was sliced for
histological and immunohistochemical analyses, and 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining.
In the GSNO group, GSNO (0.25 mg/kg body weight) in
saline (~250 μL) was slowly infused by jugular vein cannulation
at 1 hour after reperfusion. From 1 day after MCAO and thereafter, the same dose of GSNO was gavage fed until 7 or 14 days
following IR. Physiological parameters did not alter after GSNO
treatment. Details of the study on physiologic parameters in IR
and GSNO-treated rats have been reported earlier.11 In GSNO +
2-ME group, GSNO was treated for 7 days as described above.
2-ME (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) administration to the GSNO
group was initiated 24 hours after the first dose of GSNO treatment and continued until the 7th day after IR.

Evaluation of ischemic infarct
Coronal sections (2 mm) were immersed in 1% solution
of TTC in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) at 37°C for
15 minutes, as described previously.12 After staining, infarctions were measured using Scion Image software (Scion
Corp., Frederick, MD, USA). Total infarct area was multiplied by the thickness of the brain sections to obtain infarct
volume as described previously.7 To minimize the error introduced by edema and liquefaction after infarction, an indirect
method for calculating infarct volume was also used.39,40 The
non-infarcted area in the ipsilateral hemisphere was subtracted from that in the contralateral hemisphere, and infarct
volume was calculated using the following formula:
Contralateral hemispheric volume −
Ipsilateral non-infarcted volume
=
of infarct volume
Contralateral hemispheric volume

Evaluation of neurological score
and motor behavior
Animals in each group were evaluated for neurological
scores, subtle behavior (using body swing test), and motor
coordination and balance (using rotarod task) before and at
the 7th and 14th days after reperfusion. The body weight of

Notes: Cells were seeded in 12-well plates. After 24 hours of culture, cells were transfected with two different HIF-1α siRNAs (A: SC-44308 and B: SC-35562) using the
bEnd3 Standard Transfection protocol (CRL-2299; Altogen Biosystems, Las Vegas, NV, USA) for 72 hours. Transfected cells were treated with GSNO 100 µM for 24 hours.
Cells were harvested and homogenized using RIPA buffer. (A) Western blot for HIF-1α, VEGF, and β-actin. (B) Densitometry of HIF-1α and VEGF normalized with β-actin.

each animal was determined before surgery and at days 7 and
14 after IR.
Neurological examination was performed by an observer
masked from the identity of the groups. A neurological
grading system with a 4-point scale (0–3), as described
previously,7 was used: 0, no observable neurological deficit
(normal); 1, failure to extend right forepaw on lifting the
whole body by tail (mild); 2, circling to the contralateral side
(moderate); and 3, leaning to the contralateral side at rest
or no spontaneous motor activity (severe). The animals not
showing paralysis at 1 hour after MCAO were excluded from
the study because the reduction of blood flow may not have
produced an infarction of adequate size to cause quantifiable
neurological deficits in those animals.
Modified neurological severity score (mNSS) measurement was performed as described previously.41 The test
is sensitive to unilateral cortical injury because it reflects

Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2015:9

multiple asymmetries, including postural, sensory, and
forelimb and hind limb use. A detailed description of this
functional test has been previously reported.42 In our studies,
mNSS was scaled from 0 to 12, with 0 as normal and 12 as
the maximal deficit.15
The body swing test reflects symmetry of striatal function.43
A normal rat typically has an equal number of swings to both
sides. Each rat was held along the vertical axis (defined as no
more than 10° to either the left or the right side) approximately
2.5 centimeters from the base of its tail and elevated 2.5 centimeters above a table surface. A swing was recorded whenever
the rat moved its head out of the vertical axis to either side. The
rats have to return to the vertical position for the next swing to
be counted. Thirty total swings (score 3) were counted.
In the motor coordination and balance test, rats were
examined on an accelerating rotarod task by trained personnel
blinded to animal groups as described previously.44 Walking

described from our laboratory. 12 Speed was increased
from 0 rpm to 30 rpm, with an increment of 2 rpm every
5 seconds. Each rat was placed on the rotarod cylinder, and
the speed (rpm) at which the animal fell off the drum was
recorded. The trial ended if the animal fell off the drum. Each
animal was given three trials, and the mean speed (rpm) of
three trials was calculated for each animal.

allowed to react with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to a
peroxidase-labeled dextran polymer and then developed
with diaminobenzidine substrate. All sections were examined for immunoreactivity in the peri-infarct area using an
Olympus microscope as previously described.9,14 Three areas

The degree of neuronal damage (loss of viable neurons) was
evaluated by cresyl violet (Nissl) staining. The staining highlights important structural features of neurons. The brain sections
described above were used to stain with Nissl, and the staining
was performed according to classical histology methods.12
Cells that contained Nissl substance were considered to be
viable neurons. Condensed fragmented staining shows neuronal
degeneration. The viable neurons were quantified by manually

Western blot analysis

Statistical evaluation

In the peri-infarct area from the ipsilateral injured brain tissue,
Western blot was performed using antibodies against HIF-1α
and PECAM-1 (Abcam), VEGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc.), and β-actin, as described earlier.9 Protein concentrations were determined using protein assay dye from Bio-Rad
Laboratories Inc. (Hercules, CA, USA). Densitometry of
protein expression was performed using a GS800 calibrated
densitometer from Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.

Statistical analysis was performed as described previously50
using GraphPad Prism 5.01 software. Unless otherwise
stated, all values are expressed as mean ± standard deviation of n determinations or as mentioned. The results were
examined by unpaired Student’s t-test. Multiple comparisons were performed using the Kruskal–Wallis test, or
using analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni test
as appropriate. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered
significant.

siRNA silencing of HIF-1α expression
and treatment with GSNO in a mouse
brain capillary endothelial cell line
(bEnd3)
bEnd3, an immortalized mouse brain endothelial cell line
originally generated and characterized,46 and lately used in
our studies,47 is commercially available at American Type
Culture Collection ([ATCC] CRL-2299; Manassas, VA,
USA). It is a well-characterized endothelial cell line that
shows the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.47 Cells were
grown according to the supplier’s instructions and were
allowed to grow to ~70%–80% confluence. HIF-1α expression was silenced for 72 hours by two different predesigned
siRNA sequence primers from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc. (A: SC-44308 and B: SC-35562) and the corresponding scrambled siRNA (negative control) into the cells using
the bEnd3 standard transfection reagent (CRL-2299; Altogen Biosystems, Las Vegas, ND, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and as elsewhere described.48
Transfected cells were treated with freshly prepared GSNO
(100 µM) for 24 hours. Western blots for HIF-1α (ab65979;
Abcam), VEGF (SC507; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.),
and β-actin (4967; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA)
were performed using 20 µg protein samples.

Matrigel analysis
Matrigel assay was performed as described previously.49
Briefly, bEnd3 endothelial cells were plated in a six-well
Matrigel plate (BD Biocoat Matrigel Matrix, 354432). The
cells were seeded at a density of 105 cells per well in 2 mL
medium. At 2 hours after seeding in Matrigel, the cells were
treated with GSNO (100 µM), 2-ME (5 µM), or GSNO followed by 2-ME (30 minutes later). The cells were observed
under a microscope for formation of tube-like structures
at 3, 18, and 48 hours. Tubule length ratio, branch number
per field, and aggregation area were analyzed using ImageJ
software.

Results
GSNO treatment of IR for 2 weeks
enhanced the expression of angiogenic
mediators
Essential factors for the neurorepair process following
stroke include the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α and
enhanced expression of the angiogenic factor VEGF along
with the endothelial cell proliferation mediator PECAM-1
(angiogenesis). S-Nitrosylation/GSNO has been shown to
stabilize HIF-1α, leading to increased VEGF expression,
angiogenesis, and protection against myocardial injury.18
In this study, we observed that immunohistochemical
staining 14 days after IR shows an increased expression of
HIF-1α (Figure 1A), VEGF (Figure 1C), and PECAM-1
(Figure 1E) in the peri-infarct area. GSNO treatment of IR
significantly increased the expression further of HIF-1α,
VEGF, and PECAM-1. Similar results of increased expression in the GSNO group from the peri-infract area at the 14th
day after IR were confirmed for HIF-1α (Figure 1B), VEGF
(Figure 1D), and PECAM-1 (Figure 1F) using Western blot.
In summary, GSNO treatment of IR increased the expression
of angiogenic mediators.

GSNO treatment of IR for 2 weeks
increased the number of blood vessels
and enhanced the expression of a cell
proliferation marker
Quantitatively comparing vessel density using markers for
vessels and a cell proliferation marker provides a measure
of angiogenic vessel formation.51 GSNO treatment of IR
for 2 weeks increased the expression of markers of vessel
density, including laminin (Figure 2A) and GSL-1 (Figure
2B), indicating that GSNO may have promoted new vessel
formation. Supporting the notion that the increased number
of vessels present in the peri-infarct area resulted from angiogenic processes, we determined the expression of Ki67, a

marker of cell proliferation. The expression of Ki67 (Figure
2C) was significantly increased in GSNO-treated animals
compared with IR animals. We anticipate that proliferating
cells include endothelial cells also because vessel density is
increased; however, we did not identify Ki67-positive cell
types in this study. Sham animals had significantly lower
expressions of angiogenic markers (Figure 2).

GSNO treatment of IR for 2 weeks
improved motor function and accelerated
the recovery of subtle behavior
Compromised neurobehavioral functions, especially motor
coordination and balance, and neurological functions are
the leading causes of disability and morbidity following
stroke. We determined the efficacy of GSNO in improving
motor and subtle behaviors. GSNO treatment significantly
improved tolerated rotation speed (rotarod task) (Figure 3A)
compared with the IR group measured at the 14th day after
IR. The treatment with GSNO also improved body swing
behavior (Figure 3B) and mNSS measured at day 14 after IR
(Figure 3D). The body weight of animals in the GSNO group
was also significantly improved compared with animals in
the IR group (Figure 3C).

Beneficial effects of GSNO on
neuroprotection and functional recovery
were blocked by HIF-1α inhibitor 2-ME
2-ME is a natural metabolite of estradiol and has been documented to inhibit HIF-1α stabilization and thus its transcriptional activity.52 Therefore, we investigated whether 2-ME
reverses GSNO’s HIF-1α-dependent activities (Figure 4).
Administration of 2-ME to GSNO-treated animals for
6 days (first dose of 2-ME was administered 24 hours after
IR to investigate its effect after the acute phase) blocked
GSNO’s protective effect on brain infarctions and functional
recovery as evaluated by TTC staining (Figure 4A and B),
Nissl staining (Figure 4C and D), and neurological score
(Figure 4E). Furthermore, 2-ME treatment completely
blocked the beneficial effect of GSNO on motor function
recovery evaluated by rotarod performance (Figure 4F).
As expected, 2-ME treatment robustly inhibited HIF-1α
protein expression (Figure 4G and H) as well as significantly reversed GSNO-mediated enhanced expression of
PECAM-1 (Figure 4I and J). Reversal of GSNO’s effect
by 2-ME was remarkably significant at day 7 after IR;
therefore, the experiment was stopped at the 7th day after
the injury.

GSNO stimulates HIF-1α/VEGF pathway

GSNO-mediated enhanced protein
expression of VEGF was reversed
by silencing HIF-1α in endothelial cells
Stabilization of HIF-1α results in increased HIF-1 transcriptional activity, leading to induction of HIF-1-dependent
genes, including angiogenic VEGF. GSNO treatment
resulted in greater protein expression of both HIF-1α and
VEGF compared with untreated cells (Figure 5). Single
siRNA (A or B) silencing for HIF-1α reduced the expression of HIF-1α as well as VEGF; however, silencing with
both A and B siRNA remarkably reduced the expression
of HIF-1α and VEGF. Moreover, cell transfection with
two HIF-1α-targeted siRNAs markedly reduced GSNOmediated HIF-1α stabilization and prevented the resultant
expression of VEGF (Figure 5), consistent with a role
of GSNO in HIF-1α stabilization and the stimulation of
angiogenesis. However, a reduced level of both HIF-1α
and VEGF in A + B + GSNO compared with A + B
set was unanticipated and may be attributed to the stability
of GSNO under bEnd3 cell transfection conditions.

GSNO-stimulated formation of capillarylike structures on endothelial cells was
blunted by the inhibition of HIF-1α
We next examined the ability of GSNO to stimulate formation
and stabilization of tube/capillary-like proangiogenic structures on endothelial cultured cells using Matrigel (in vitro
angiogenesis). Tube/capillary-like proangiogenic structures
were significantly increased after 48-hour GSNO treatment
(Figure 6). Further, we assessed the effect of HIF-1α inhibition using 2-ME on GSNO-stimulated capillary-like structure
formation. 2-ME is a specific HIF-1α inhibitor and has been
widely used for the inhibition of angiogenesis.52 We observed
that GSNO’s capillary-like structure formation ability was
prevented by 2-ME, indicating that the GSNO-stimulated
proangiogenic process was mediated by HIF-1α activity
(Figure 6).

Discussion
To facilitate functional recovery, an ideal stroke therapy must
ameliorate acute as well as chronic phases of the injury by wellunderstood mechanisms. Our previous studies showed that
GSNO treatment of IR provided neuroprotection in the acute
phase7,9 and improved neurobehavioral function in the chronic
phase.12 However, the mechanisms of GSNO-mediated stimulation of the neurorepair process require elucidation in order
to determine and then to widen its therapeutic potential.

Functional recovery in stroke is associated with vascular integrity and the stimulation of both angiogenesis and
neurogenesis.53 Stroke patients who have higher cerebral
blood vessel density recover better and survive longer than
patients who have lower vascular density.54 A low degree of
restorative angiogenesis after stroke results in limited and
insufficient functional recovery. However, angiogenesispromoting therapeutics confer not only a greater degree but
also a faster rate of functional improvement.55,56 Because
GSNO also produces effects that increase vessel density
(Figure 2) and enhance functional recovery (Figure 3),
GSNO likely promotes angiogenesis. 54 Findings from
other studies that observed GSNO-induced angiogenesis
in ischemic heart18 and in a cell culture model57 support
our observation of GSNO-mediated increased expression
of angiogenic markers (Figure 1) and a cell proliferation
marker (Figure 2C), as well as an increased number of vessels (Figure 2A and B).
The angiogenic marker VEGF is closely related to both
angiogenesis and neurogenesis.53 Increased neurogenesis
is accompanied by increased angiogenesis, whereas angiogenesis upregulates neurogenesis and NO-based drugs
upregulate both.58 Angiogenesis itself is regulated by VEGF,
mainly via HIF-1-based transcription. VEGF has been shown
to modulate coupling of angiogenesis and neurogenesis;
hence, it is an essential factor for regeneration.53,59 Therefore,
we investigated the effect of GSNO on VEGF as well as
PECAM-1 (markers of angiogenesis), finding that GSNO
increased the expression of both following IR (Figure 1).
This observation indicates that GSNO might be acting via the
upregulation of VEGF. VEGF is transcriptionally regulated
by HIF-1, and HIF-1α is stabilized by GSNO.25,26 Figure 1
shows that GSNO increased the expression of and thereby
stabilized HIF-1α. Consistent with our findings, endogenous
GSNO-induced stabilization of HIF-1α via S-nitrosylation
was shown to induce the expression of VEGF, resulting in
angiogenesis and myocardial protection.18
A potential concern of GSNO’s impact on VEGF is
that HIF-1α-dependent upregulation of VEGF has been
implicated in edema and BBB leakage in the acute phase
of IR and cerebral hemorrhage.60,61 For VEGF-mediated
BBB disruption to occur, MMP-9 and endothelial dysfunction are required.9,62 However, in addition to upregulating
VEGF, GSNO transcriptionally downregulated MMP-9 as
well as ICAM-1 and E-selectin, leading to reduced edema
and increased BBB protection in the acute phase of IR and
traumatic brain injury.9,15 Similarly, MMP-9-associated BBB
disruption in experimental diabetes has been prevented by
an exogenous treatment of GSNO.63 Exogenous inhibition

of GSNOR and thus increased levels of GSNO have also
been reported to improve endothelial function.38 Decreased
levels of HIF-1α in cerebrospinal fluid from hypoxic/
ischemic humans64 support the notion that HIF-1α-mediated
mechanisms may ameliorate stroke injury. These observations indicate that HIF-1α is likely an important beneficial
component of neuroprotection and the neurovascular repair
process.
To show that GSNO invokes its neurorestorative/neurorepair
effects via the HIF-1α/VEGF pathway, as depicted in
Figure 7, we inhibited HIF-1α, anticipating that it would
block the effect of GSNO on angiogenic mediators and functional recovery. The inhibition of HIF-1α in GSNO-treated
animals reduced the expression of HIF-1α (Figure 4G and
H) as well as PECAM-1 (Figure 4I and J), indicating that the
angiogenic effect of GSNO was dependent on the activity
of HIF-1α. 2-ME treatment of GSNO animals also blunted
GSNO-mediated neuroprotection (Figure 4A–D), decreased
neurological score (Figure 4E), and reduced motor function
recovery (Figure 4F). These findings support the protective role of HIF-1α. Furthermore, endothelial cell culture
studies showing reduced tube formation (Matrigel assay for
angiogenesis) by 2-ME in GSNO-treated cells (Figure 6)
provide evidence that GSNO’s regenerative repair effects
are mediated by HIF-1α/VEGF pathway-induced angiogenesis. Reduced VEGF expression in GSNO-treated HIF-1αsilenced cells (Figure 5) confirms that the GSNO-stimulated
VEGF/angiogenesis pathway is dependent on the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α. Recently, stabilization of HIF-1α
by N-acetylcysteine has been documented to provide neuroprotection in stroke,65 and its inhibition by 2-ME reduces
neuroprotection and downregulates neurorepair processes
in cerebral IR.65,66 2-ME has also been reported to worsen
outcomes after global ischemia.67 These observations further
suggest that GSNO-induced angiogenic and neurorestorative
processes are mediated through the stabilization of HIF-1α.
The documented HIF-1α stabilization by GSNO-mediated
S-nitrosylation (Cys-800) leading to stimulation of its transcriptional activity68 supports our finding of GSNO-mediated
enhanced transcriptional activity of HIF-1α and the expression of VEGF (Figure 1). An enhanced level of GSNO has
been shown to stimulate the HIF-1α-dependent angiogenic
process, protecting against cardiac ischemic injury.18,37
In view of the above observations, we hypothesized that
GSNO-mediated S-nitrosylation and stabilization of HIF-1α
will enhance VEGF and PECAM-1, leading to increased
vessel density and functional recovery (Figure 7).
Both deficient S-nitrosylation and a reduction in NO
signaling pathways are observed in several neurodegenerative

disease processes, including stroke.9,69–72 These pathologies
occur due to decreased bioavailability of NO and, hence,
reduced biosynthesis of GSNO. We have previously documented reduced levels of NO and decreased expression of
S-nitrosocysteine proteins (-SNO) in the peri-infarct area.
This decreased -SNO was normalized by an exogenous
GSNO treatment.9 In short, reduced NO and -SNO are associated with IR pathophysiology. These observations are further
supported by a report showing decreased levels of plasma
NO and associated poor outcomes in stroke patients.73 Plasma
S-nitrosothiols are also decreased in patients with endothelial
dysfunction.74 These results indicate that S-nitrosylation is
reduced in IR; therefore, exogenous GSNO supplementation
in stroke therapy is a promising strategy. Although HIF-1α
stabilization-based therapy using chemical inhibitors of
PHDs is under investigation in chronic ischemic diseases,
they also invoke HIF-1α-independent effects.22 Therefore,
a direct stabilization by S-nitrosylation of HIF-1α through the
endogenous signaling molecule GSNO is mechanistically a
more specific therapeutic approach especially for IR stroke
therapy. The role of the GSNO/HIF-1α/VEGF pathway
in permanent ischemic stroke is less clear. Nonetheless,
evidence from clinical studies suggests that administration
of NO-based therapeutics in humans is safe and may be an
effective treatment for stroke injury in human subjects.75,76

Conclusion
GSNO-mediated HIF-1α stabilization for neuroprotection and
the stimulation of the neurorepair process provides a novel
target mechanism for a therapy that could confer benefits in
both the acute and chronic phases of stroke. The translational
potential of GSNO is high because it occurs naturally in the
human body and its exogenous administration to humans is
not associated with any known side effects or toxicity. This
study shows the feasibility of a new treatment paradigm for
stroke, introducing the concept that stabilization of HIF-1α
using GSNO may reduce disabilities in stroke survivors.
