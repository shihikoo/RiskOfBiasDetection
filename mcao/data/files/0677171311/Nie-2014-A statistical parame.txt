Abstract
Purpose: PET (positron emission tomography) imaging researches of functional metabolism using fluorodeoxyglucose (18FFDG) of animal brain are important in neuroscience studies. FDG-PET imaging studies are often performed on groups of rats,
so it is desirable to establish an objective voxel-based statistical methodology for group data analysis.
Material and Methods: This study establishes a statistical parametric mapping (SPM) toolbox (plug-ins) named spmratIHEP
for voxel-wise analysis of FDG-PET images of rat brain, in which an FDG-PET template and an intracranial mask image of rat
brain in Paxinos & Watson space were constructed, and the default settings were modified according to features of rat brain.
Compared to previous studies, our constructed rat brain template comprises not only the cerebrum and cerebellum, but
also the whole olfactory bulb which made the later cognitive studies much more exhaustive. And with an intracranial mask
image in the template space, the brain tissues of individuals could be extracted automatically. Moreover, an atlas space is
used for anatomically labeling the functional findings in the Paxinos & Watson space. In order to standardize the template
image with the atlas accurately, a synthetic FDG-PET image with six main anatomy structures is constructed from the atlas,
which performs as a target image in the co-registration.
Results: The spatial normalization procedure is evaluated, by which the individual rat brain images could be standardized
into the Paxinos & Watson space successfully and the intracranial tissues could also be extracted accurately. The practical
usability of this toolbox is evaluated using FDG-PET functional images from rats with left side middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) in comparison to normal control rats. And the two-sample t-test statistical result is almost related to the
left side MCA.
Conclusion: We established a toolbox of SPM8 named spmratIHEP for voxel-wise analysis of FDG-PET images of rat brain.

for efficient interpretation of physiological significance is a pivotal
problem to be solved. In 18F-FDG imaging studies of human

most popular software for image analysis voxel-by-voxel. Groups
of human brain images can be statistical analyzed in SPM

Introduction
PET (positron emission tomography) imaging techniques of
functional metabolism using fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) have
been increasingly used for the investigation of human brain
functions in normal and diseased individuals [1–3]. Complementary to human brain studies, animal experiments are important for
pathogenesis research, therapeutic efficacy evaluation, and drug
development, for it allows transverse comparisons between
different brain regions or between different rats, and longitudinal
follow-up. While numbers of small-animal FDG-PET imaging
studies are performed on groups of rodents, how to analyze images

Voxel-Wise Analysis for PET Images of Rat Brain

between MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and FDG-PET
images of small animals, automated image co-registration of
FDG-PET data with MRI templates is difficult. Therefore, the
established MRI template [4–6] could not be used in FDG-PET
studies of rat brain. Casteels et al. [7] has first constructed an
FDG-PET template of rat brain in Paxinos & Watson space [8]
used for spatial normalization. The introduction of their template
has accelerated a number of FDG-PET studies in rats [9,10].
However, we noted that this template do not include the olfactory
bulb of rat. As implied in some important researches recently,
there is a close association between olfactory dysfunction and
cognitive impairment [11–16]. Therefore, the olfactory bulb is
necessary not only in olfaction study but also in cognitive study,
which should be included in template image of rat brain. In
addition, in Casteels’ study [7], only ten female rats ranged from
13 to 34 weeks old were used for the template construction.
Hence, in order to improve the group representation of the
template for both male and female rats, and to better account for
the brain variability due to aging process, our current work will
include rats with more balanced male/female ratio (twelve male
and twelve female adult rats) and narrower age range (10,13 wk
old).
The extracranial tissues were unwanted in imaging data
analysis. Recently, the intracranial tissues of each rat are usually
traced out manually [5,7], which is subjective, labor-intensive and
time-consuming. In the human, the extracranial tissues could be
automatically removed by an intracranial mask after spatial
normalization, of which idea could also be used in rat brain
studies. Therefore, in this study, an intracranial mask corresponding to our constructed FDG-PET template will be established to
remove extracranial tissues of individual images automatically
after spatial normalization.
Furthermore, the assignment of anatomical location to functional effects is critical in the interpretation physiological
significance of statistical result of voxel-wise analysis. For
anatomical localization, an atlas space is prerequisite, such as
the Tailarach space for human brain studies [17]. In rat brain
studies, the stereotaxic coordinates by Paxinos & Watson [18] is
one of the most widely used. Previously, several groups established
digital coordinates [5,7] or atlas image [4,6] for anatomical
localization. However, only a digital atlas is not enough for
functional location. It is prerequisite to standardize the template
into the atlas space [5,7]. When the FDG-PET template is fitted
into the Paxinos & Watson space, functional effects could be
precisely allocated to anatomical structures, which could also be
used to define the uptake in the structures [10].
To align the template into the atlas space, Schweinhardt et al.
[5] used the landmark-based linear registration techniques with
forty-nine homologous anatomical landmarks, which performed
successfully in structural MRI template. In FDG-PET studies of
rat brain, Rubins et al. [19] registered FDG-PET images to a
synthetic FDG-PET target image which was constructed from
atlas-derived VOI (voxel of interest) images using rigid body
transformation, which has only six anatomical regions. Casteels
et al. [7] standardized the functional template into the Paxinos
space via the MRI template [5] using linear transformation
method based on the mutual information maximization algorithm
in SPM2. However, because the template image and the atlas are
constructed from different subjects, only linear transformation is
not sufficient to standardize the template into the atlas space. In
order to combine both linear and non-linear transformation
method in co-registration of the template and the atlas, Coello
et al. [10] constructed synthetic FDG-PET image from MRI
image, by segmenting the MRI image into white matter (WM) and
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

gray matter (GM) and then conducting a weighted sum of the GM
and WM maps. Thus, an individual FDG-PET image can be
standardized into the Paxinos & Watson space while it was
spatially normalized to the synthetic FDG-PET template. However, the spatial resolution of the synthetic FDG-PET image with
only two resolvable regions is too low. Therefore, in our study, in
order to improve the co-registration accuracy, six main anatomy
structures, all of which could be identified in the FDG-PET
template according to the voxel intensity ranges and locations, will
be defined from an atlas image [4] in Paxinos & Watson space [18]
to construct a synthetic FDG-PET image. Then, both linear and
non-linear transformation method will be employed to standardize
the FDG-PET canonical brain into the Paxinos & Watson space
[18] via the synthetic FDG-PET image.
With the introduction above, the current study is designed to
establish a voxel-wise analysis method of FDG-PET images of rat
brain. In detail, an FDG-PET rat brain template, comprised
cerebrum, cerebellum, olfactory bulb and extracranial tissues, will
be constructed which is used for spatial normalization of individual
rat brain images. An intracranial mask image in the FDG-PET
template space will be constructed for extracranial tissues
automatic removing. The FDG-PET template will be standardized
into the Paxinos & Watson space for the localization of functional
investigation. Finally, the constructed template sets are compiled
as a SPM8 toolbox (plug-ins) named spmratIHEP. Moreover, to
evaluate the usefulness of the toolbox implemented in SPM8, we
analyze the data from rats with left side middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) and those without. The spmratIHEP toolbox is
available by contacting the corresponding author at shanbc@ihep.

Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals and data acquisition
Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats of either sex, 10,13
weeks old, weight 350 g620 g, were used for template construction. A further ten similar rats were used for evaluation of spatial
normalization and removal of extracranial tissues. Voxel-wise
analysis of brain images was done on male SD rats, 9,11 weeks
old; weight 300 g620 g; 9 underwent left side middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) and 8 were healthy controls. Intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was accomplished using a modification of the Longa technique [20–22].
Under an operating microscope, the left common carotid artery
(CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid artery
(ICA) were exposed through a midline incision. The vagus nerve
was carefully preserved as far as possible. After proximal CCA was
ligated, a 3-0 uncoated monofilament nylon suture with rounded
tip (2634,Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd. China) was inserted
from the lumen of the distal CCA and advanced into the ICA,
approximately 1860.5 mm beyond the bifurcation until mild
resistance indicated that the tip was lodged in the anterior
resistance cerebral artery, thus blocking blood flow to the middle
cerebral artery. All the rats were deprived of food for 12–15 h
before 18F-FDG injection, but had access to drinking water at all
time [23].
18
F-FDG was prepared at PET center of China PLA General
Hospital. For each rat, 18F-FDG (18.5 MBq/100 g of body
weight) was administered via tailvein injection without anesthesia.
Then the rats were kept in their cages and placed in a room with
minimal ambient noise for the 18F-FDG uptake. The uptake
period was 40 min for maximization of 18F-FDG uptake in the
brain [24]. Then the rats were anesthetized with isoflurane

saved as Analyze format.
For the ten rats used for evaluation of spatial normalization and
removal of extracranial tissues by the spmratIHEP toolbox, FDGPET images were acquired on a micro PET system (E-plus166,
Institute of High Energy Physics, CAS, China), of which the radial
spatial resolution is 1.67 mm FWHM at the centre of the FOV.
During FDG-PET scan, all the rats were anesthetized with
isoflurane (the same as described above) and placed in the scanner
with a plastic stereotactic head holder in prone position on the
scanner bed. And the rat brain was centered in the FOV to
perform a static acquisition of 30 minutes. Images were
subsequently reconstructed using Filtered Back projection (FBP)
algorithm. Images were reconstructed on a 1286128663 matrix,

For the twenty-four rats used in template construction, FDGPET imaging was performed at the PET center of China PLA
General Hospital in MicroPET/CT imaging system (eXplore
Vista-CT, GE, USA), of which the radial spatial resolution is
1.0 mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) at the centre of the
field of view (FOV). During FDG-PET scan, all the rats were
anesthetized with isoflurane (the same as described above) and
placed in the scanner with a plastic stereotactic head holder in
prone position on the scanner bed. And the rat brain was centered
in the FOV to perform a static acquisition of 10 minutes. Images
were subsequently reconstructed using 3D ordered set expectation
maximization (3D-OSEM) algorithm. Corrections for dead time,
decay, attenuation, random coincidences and scattering were
applied. Images were reconstructed on a 1756175661 matrix,

where imgf and imgs are the initial and the new target images
respectively, the subscript i is the running voxel position index
(ordered as 1, 2, … n as a 1D vector) in the image matrix, and n is
the total number of voxels. Then the original 24 images were
recursively registered to the new average target image. A newer
average target image was created from the newly registered
images. And the mean squared residual difference was subsequently computed between the current target image and the
previous one. This procedure, including registration, averaging
and computing the mean squared residual difference, was repeated
until the latest mean residual squared difference was stabilized (less
than 5% in this current study) [4]. And the latest average target
image was our final average image with extracranial tissue.

2.2. Template construction
2.2.1. Construction of an average template image. The
FDG-PET rat brain template image with the extracranial tissues
was created using SPM8. All of the 24 images included in this
study were inspected and were found equally of high quality in
terms of the image contrast, noise level, and resolution. Firstly, the
voxel size of all the brain images of 24 rats were adjusted to [1 1
1.8], which was scaled up in the Analyze header by the factor of 4
to better approximate human dimensions [5]. Then, the images
were manually sheared to roughly remove voxels of the body and
background by MRIcro [25]. Afterwards, the average template
image was created recursively by registering [26–28] and
averaging. In detail, one of these 24 rat brains was selected as
the initial brain template. Each rat brain image was spatially

We adopted the global histogram threshold method to exclude
voxels outside the rat brain. The threshold was determined by
Otsu’s criterion [30], which maximizes the between-class variance
to get the optimal global threshold value. Prior to determining the
threshold, a rectangular bounding box containing the intracranial
tissue was defined straightforwardly for each slice with two mouse

clicks for the upper left and lower right vertices in MRIcro [25].
And voxels outside the bounding box of the rat brain were
removed (assigned zero intensity). Similarly, smaller rectangles
over left and right eyes were drawn separately to remove the
eyeballs. Finally, the intracranial portion of the image including
the olfactory could be identified by collecting the non-zero voxels
whose intensities were greater than the global histogram threshold
obtained by Otsu’s criterion [30].
Moreover, this extracted canonical brain was processed by
binarization transformation to create an intracranial mask image
in the standard template space. The origin point of the canonical
brain and intracranial mask was the same with the template. Thus,
after normalizing to the FDG-PET template, the extracranial
tissues of individuals could be automatically removed by this
intracranial mask image.
2.2.3. Construction of synthetic PET image. In this study,
the paired rat brain structural MRI template and digital atlas in
Paxinos & Watson space we constructed before [4] were used for
functional effects localization, which comprised from the anterior
part of olfactory bulb (zbregma +7.56 mm) to the posterior part of
cerebellum (zbregma 215.72 mm). In order to co-register the
canonical FDG-PET brain with the MRI structural template and
atlas, we created a low-resolution synthetic PET image from the
atlas [4]. For this purpose, the 624 regions were merged into six
main anatomy structures, all of which could be identified in the
FDG-PET template according to the voxel intensity ranges and
locations. These 6 anatomy structures included olfactory bulb,
cortex, hippocampi, thalamus, mesencephalon and cerebellar.
Voxels within each of these 6 regions over the pseudo FDG-PET
image were assigned the mean intensity value over the
corresponding part in the FDG-PET template. Finally, this
synthetic FDG-PET image was further smoothed using an
isotropic Gaussian kernel of 26264 mm3 FWHM to smooth the
juncture of the neighboring segmented parts.

2.3. Construction of the SPM8 plug-ins toolbox named
spmratIHEP
In order to analyze rat brain images with less manual
manipulation, we constructed a SPM8 plug-ins toolbox named
spmratIHEP using MATLAB. Because of the differences between
human brain and rat brain, the processing methods and parameter
settings in SPM8 must be modified according to the feature of rat
brain FDG-PET imaging, which were described in detail as below.
Firstly, spatial normalization is prerequisite in voxel-wise
analysis to eliminate individual differences. In order to use the
available affine transformation and subsequent non-linear warping
algorithm in SPM8, the voxel size of individual brain images was
scaled up in the Analyze header by a factor to better approximate
human dimensions, which will not affect any interpretation of the
statistical results of rat brain.
Then, the constructed FDG-PET template and intracranial
mask of rat brain took replacement of the human brain. And the
default parameter settings of spatial normalization were adjust
according to the feature of rat brain, that the bounding box was
adjust to [2150 2180 2126; 150 60 72], the voxel size was adjust
to [1 1 1.8] after zooming and the affine regularization was adjust
to ‘average sized template’. Moreover, the image matrix of
intracranial rat brain images after spatial normalization was
sheared to [120 80 98] automatically to cut off the background.
Smoothing was used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in
SPM, in which the Gaussian kernel was adjust to 26264 mm3
FWHM, which was approximately two times of the spatial
resolution of rat brain after zooming [7].
Finally, in order to display the statistical results of rat brain in
Paxinos & Watson space, the definition of coordinates of rat brain
took replacement of the human brain. The accurate location of the
maximum FDG changes was modified according to the Paxinos &
Watson space, in which the x-axis is negative to the left from the
midline and positive to the right, the y-axis is positive to the ventral
direction relative to the dorsal, and the z-axis is positive to the
olfactory bulb direction relative to the bregma and negative to the
cerebellum direction. Moreover, a new projection figure of rat
brain was created to show the projection of overall blob regions,
and a MRI T2-weighted (MRI T2WI) structural image of a single
rat brain in Paxinos & Watson space was prepared to show the
three-dimensional view of a blob region.

2.2.4. Co-registration of the canonical brain with the atlas
in Paxinos & Watson space. The synthetic FDG-PET image

was chosen as the target image. The SPM intensity-based affine
transformation algorithm and subsequent non-linear warping
algorithm was employed to co-register the canonical brain with
this target atlas image [31], and the same transformation matrix
was applied to the average template image and mask image. At
this point, the co-registered template image, canonical brain and
mask image were in Paxinos space, which consist the final
standard template set. Finally, the origin point of the template set
coordinate space was positioned at dorsal 3rd ventricle (D3V).

Voxel-Wise Analysis for PET Images of Rat Brain

2.4. Data analysis of MCAO rat model in the spmratIHEP
toolbox
The analysis of MCAO rat model images was performed using
our spmratIHEP toolbox to evaluate its practical use. Firstly, the
body tissues and background of individual images were manually
removed using MRIcro [25] and the origin of the image was
repositioned at D3V which is corresponding to the standard FDGPET template in Paxinos space. Then, the data sets were analyzed
in the spmratIHEP automatically as described in the flowchart of
Fig. 1. In detail, the FDG-PET images of MCAO rat model and
healthy controls were preprocessed as described below. (1)
Spatially normalize the individual images of rat brain into Paxinos
& Watson space, comprising scaling up the voxel size in the
Analyze header by the factor of 4, registering to the FDG-PET
template, subsequently removing extracranial tissues via the
intracranial image, shearing the matrix to cut off the background.
(2) Smooth the normalized images by a Gaussian kernel of
26264 mm3 FWHM.
Then, the preprocessed images were analyzed based on the
framework of the general linear model (GLM). Two-sample t-test
was performed to identify the difference of FDG signals between
the rats with MCAO and the healthy controls, in which
proportional scaling and intensity normalization was applied to
account for global confounds. Finally, the brain regions with
significant FDG changes in rats with MCAO were yielded based
on a voxel-level height threshold of p,0.05 (FWE corrected) and a
cluster-extent threshold of 50 voxels.

Results
3.1. The constructed template set in Paxinos space
The constructed template set in Paxinos space was shown in
Fig. 2, matrix size 30062406110, voxel size 16161.8 mm3 after
zooming. This template set was consisted of the standard FDGPET template with extracranial tissues (Fig. 2A), the corresponding canonical brain (Fig. 2B) and the mask image (Fig. 2C). The
original point was on D3V, as the cross point of red lines shown in
Fig. 2.

3.2. Spatial normalization and extracranial tissue
removing of the individual images
To illustrate the successful use of the intracranial mask image in
removing non-brain tissues automatically, both datasets obtained
for template construction and spatial normalization evaluations
were used. The individual images from both datasets were spatially
normalized in spmratIHEP. The extraction of three randomly
chosen rats result was shown in Fig. 3, of which one was from the
group for template construction (Fig. 3B) and the other two were
from the group obtained by E-plus166 system of IHEP (Fig. 3C
and Fig. 3D). Moreover, for quantitatively evaluation, three
experts, who are the co-authors of this paper (Hua Liu, Xiaofeng
Jiang and Baoci Shan), were invited to manually extract the brain
tissues from individual FDG-PET images from both two datasets
separately by the software ImageJ (Image Processing and Analysis
in Java) (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij). Then, four volumetric and
spatial correspondence measures, Jaccard similarity (JS) [32,33],
the relative error on volume (RV), the proportions of false-positive
(FP), and false-negative (FN) [4,34,35], were calculated between
manually traced out intracranial tissues from three experts, and
the manually traced out and automatically extracted intracranial
brain volumes. The details of these measures are listed as below.
The Jaccard similarity was defined as in Eq.(2), of which the
optimal value is 100%.

The strategy we proposed to co-register the FDG-PET rat brain
template with the atlas via synthetic FDG-PET image worked well.
The pseudo FDG-PET with six major structures is shown in
Fig. 4. This image was only used as a target image for coregistering the FDG-PET template.
For qualitatively evaluation, the co-registered FDG-PET
canonical brain is overlaid on the MRI T2WI structural canonical
brain which has already standardized into Paxinos & Watson
space in our prior study [4], as shown in Fig. 5. As seen in Fig. 5,
the rat brain canonical brain was successfully standardized into the
Paxinos space. As illustrated in Figure 5, the FDG-PET canonical
brain has been standardized into the atlas space very well.

structural canonical brain in Paxinos & Watson space [4]. The
technique of synthetic FDG-PET was employed [10,19] to
standardize the FDG-PET canonical brain into the Paxinos &
Watson space. As illustrated in the Result part, the FDG-PET
canonical brain was standardized into the atlas space very well.
Although the anatomical structures are excellently delineated in
Paxinos and Watson [18], the accuracy of anatomical coordinates
for statistical result was millimeter because of the low resolution of
FDG-PET imaging.
In addition, to evaluate the performance of spmratIHEP in
voxel-wise analysis of FDG-PET images, nine rats with left side
MCAO and eight healthy controls, acquired on Siemens Inveon
PET which differs from the one imaging for template construction,
were enrolled in this study. The data preprocessing and voxel-wise
analyzing of these two groups were all performed automatically in
spmratIHEP based on SPM8. As illustrated in the Result part, the
statistical result was almost related to the left side MCA.
Therefore, our constructed toolbox performed well in rat brain
imaging data analyzing in SPM8.
In conclusion, demonstrating its adequacy and practical usage
in SPM environment, we reported the constructed FDG-PET rat
brain template in the stereotaxic coordinate space of the Paxinos
and Watson rat brain atlas. We believe it will be helpful to
streamline the neuroimaging data analyses for rat brain images
from the pre-processing stage to the reports of the statistical
inference results.

Discussion
In the current study, we established a SPM8 plug-ins toolbox
named spmratIHEP for voxel-wise analysis of FDG-PET images
of rat brain, in which an FDG-PET template and an intracranial
mask image of rat brain in Paxinos & Watson space [4,18] were
constructed, and the default settings were modified according to
the feature of rat brain.
For voxel-based statistical analysis of functional images, all the
individual images should be primarily normalized into one
common space, such as the MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute)
space in human brain studies. And the standard brain template
performs as a general criterion in spatial normalization. In our
study, to spatially normalizing individual rat brain images, an
FDG-PET rat brain template was iteratively created from 24
healthy adult rats. Because there are minor differences in
anatomical structures between healthy ones [7], our created
FDG-PET rat brain template could be a group representation of
SD rat brain. Furthermore, because there is a close association
between olfactory dysfunction and cognitive impairment [14–16],
our constructed FDG-PET template comprised not only the
cerebrum and cerebellum, but also the whole olfactory bulb,
which made the later cognitive studies much more exhaustive.
How to locate the anatomical regions of functional effects in
statistical results is important in voxel-wise analysis. In physiological significance location, the brain atlas also called stereotaxic
coordinates corresponding to the template space provides detailed
anatomical information for functional results, such as the
Tailarach coordinates for human brain studies [17]. In this study,
one of the most popular atlases in rat brain studies, the stereotaxic
coordinates established by Paxinos & Watson [18], was used for
functional effects location, based on which our group has
constructed the digital atlas and corresponding MRI T2WI
