that HSC proliferation and cell cycle turnover was significantly
promoted after stroke. So what activated these HSCs to cycle?
The authors hypothesized that the tone of the autonomous
nervous system could provide this link. Indeed, sympathetic
nerves branching out into the bone marrow can directly activate the bone marrow niche, a part of the bone marrow microenvironment comprising all nonhematopoietic cells involved
in HSC maintenance, quiescence, proliferation, and mobilization. Sympathetic nerve terminals secrete noradrenaline (also
known as norepinephrine), which binds and activates adrenergic receptors expressed on cells of the bone marrow niche.
In the current study, the authors show that mice deficient for
the β3-adrenergic receptor do not show enhanced HSC cycling
after transient middle cerebral artery occlude, concluding that
sympathetic nerve signaling contributes to the HSC-activating
effect of acute cerebral ischemia (Figure).
The current study completes a compelling series of studies
by this same group demonstrating the disease-specific consequences of adrenergic signaling on HSC homeostasis4,5—a fundamental principle discovered by Frenette et al.6 This landmark
study demonstrated that the chemokine stromal cell-derived
factor 1/CXC-motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12), a factor required to retain HSCs in the bone marrow niche, is controlled
by β3-, but not β2-, adrenergic signaling. Upon activation of
β3-adrenergic receptor, the nuclear transcription factor Sp1 is
dephosphorylated and degraded, most likely by cooperation of
a serine protease and the S26 proteasome, resulting in downregulation of CXCL12 and impaired HSC retention.6,7 As an effect
of this upstream activation by catecholamines, it was demonstrated that the appearance of HSC-enriched, lineage-negative,
Sca-1+ c-Kit+ (LSK) cells in the blood circulation depends on
circadian oscillations that correlate with sympathetic nerve
outflow. Interestingly, HSC circulation in the blood stream was
inversely correlated to CXCL12 expression in the bone marrow, and circadian variation was absent in animals deficient
in genes of the molecular clock, such as genes encoding the
transcription factor Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like, also known as Arntl or Bmal1. It is noteworthy that
the particular cellular compartment in the bone marrow niche
targeted by the nervous system remains to be fully identified. It
has been demonstrated that cells of the endosteal bone marrow
niche, such as osteoblasts, highly express CXCL12 to retain
HSCs and progenitor cells by interaction with the chemokine
receptor CXCR4 expressed on these cells. Notably, proteolytic
cleavage of CXCR4 or CXCL12 itself can mobilize bone marrow stem cells.8,9 However, β3-adrenergic receptor is not expressed by osteoblasts,10 raising the possibility that other cells
could be involved in mediating HSC mobilization after sympathetic activation. Interestingly, it has been proposed earlier that

substantial proportion of cardiovascular mortality is
caused by atherosclerosis of large and midsized arteries
that supply the brain. Stroke is the main complication of cerebral atherosclerosis and ranks second as cause of death worldwide.1 Recruitment of some myeloid cell subpopulations to
atherosclerotic lesions can drive plaque inflammation and predispose to stroke. After a stroke, myeloid cells may also be
harmful by directly aggravating the reperfusion injury to the
brain. The latter possibility is of significant clinical relevance
because epidemiological data have suggested that increased
numbers of circulating leukocytes, particularly monocytes
and neutrophils, after stroke correlate with poor outcomes.2
However, the functional mechanistic links between monocytosis and neutrophilia and stroke were unknown.

Article, see p 407
In the current issue of Circulation Research, Courties,
Nahrendorf et al addressed this intriguing question and elucidate how stroke speeds up the turnover of hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs) to specifically generate myeloid cell populations
and release them into the blood circulation.3 In their study,
the authors have chosen an established mouse stroke model,
in which the middle cerebral artery was transiently occluded.
After this procedure, the numbers of monocytes and neutrophils resident in the bone marrow increased within 3 days, an
effect caused by enhanced proliferation of myeloid progenitors, such as granulocyte-macrophage progenitors and monocyte/dendritic cell progenitors. Interestingly, this effect seems
to be specific for myeloid cells because neither noninflammatory Ly6Clow monocytes, nor B cells or lymphoid progenitors
showed increased turnover. In fact, the numbers of nonmyeloid
cells, as well as expression of their lineage-characterizing factors, such as IL-7 receptor, decreased, whereas the myeloid
transcription factor PU-1 increased, suggesting a specific effect
on the myeloid lineage. In seeking the most upstream cause of
this myeloid bias—a state defined by an increased myeloidto-lymphoid cell ratio in the bone marrow—the authors found

Figure.   Proposed mechanism of monocyte release from the bone marrow following stroke.3 Sympathetic nerve terminals, which
end in the bone marrow, secrete noradrenaline after stroke. Noradrenaline binds to β3-adrenergic receptors (ADRB3) expressed on bone
marrow stromal cells. In the resting bone marrow, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) binds to the integrin α4β1 (VLA-4) to
retain hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the stem cell niche. Additionally, high concentrations of the bone marrow stromal C-X-C motif
chemokine 12 (CXCL12) with high affinity to the receptor CXCR4 expressed on HSCs contribute to their retention. After stroke, expression
of VCAM-1 and CXCL12 decreases by an yet undefined mechanism. As a result, HSCs, myeloid progenitor cells, such as granulocytemacrophage progenitors (GMPs) and monocyte/dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs), and monocytes enter the blood circulation. Moreover,
ADRB3 signaling enhances HSC proliferation, increases the myeloid transcription factor PU-1, and generates a myeloid bias with higher
numbers of proinflammatory Ly6Chigh monocytes. Whether stroke-associated monocytosis stroke is protective by improving host defense
or detrimental by worsening reperfusion injury and neuronal survival is currently unknown (both possibilities indicated).

mesenchymal stem cells are regulated by β3-adrenergic signaling and thus represent a possible candidate cell type.5,11
The authors of the current report expanded the concept that
adrenergic signaling controls the bone marrow. Before the
current report, they showed that this mechanism causes monocytosis during myocardial infarction4 and chronic stress.5 In
addition to the mechanism presented in this report, they demonstrated earlier that bone marrow–derived monocytes infiltrate the atherosclerotic wall, aggravate local and systemic
inflammation, and eventually enhance the probability of subsequent myocardial infarction. Notably, monocytes emanating
from the bone marrow engrafted secondary niches, such as
the spleen, to fill up the myeloid reservoir for later inflammatory events.4,12 In summary of all these studies, the authors
provide evidence for the existence of a psycho-cellular vicious
cycle, in which pain, anxiety, stress (and presumably circadian
events) are potent drivers of bone marrow–derived monocytosis and HSC release with a myeloid bias, which in turn are
likely to aggravate atherosclerosis and its complications like
myocardial infarction and stroke.
In the current work, the different imaging techniques used
are of particular appeal. Several in vitro and in vivo imaging
approaches directly visualize the inside of the bone marrow

niche. Most illustratively, the authors induced experimental
stroke in transgenic mice expressing the firefly enzyme luciferase under control of the cell cycle gene nuclear factor-Y–
dependent cyclin B2 promoter. This whole body imaging
approach allows monitoring and localizing proliferating,
bioluminescent cells in living animals, including HSCs in the
bone marrow. The authors also looked at the cell proliferation within the bone at the single cell level. To achieve this,
they applied an elegant ex vivo imaging of LSK cell proliferation in the sternal bone 3 days after transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion. LSKs, which were adoptively transferred 1
day before stroke induction, were labeled at a 1:1 ratio with
the green fluorescent dye SP-DIOC and the red fluorescent
dye CM-Dil. LSKs of both colors homed to the bone marrow.
Remarkably, clusters of labeled cells found in the bone marrow were always of the same labeling color, but never in the
expected 1:1 ratio of SP-DIOC and CM-Dil, suggesting that
cell clusters were derived from locally proliferating LSKs.
Moreover, the authors directly monitored stem cell proliferation by intravital microscopy in the skull bone at 2 different
time points in the same animal. In using Nestin-GFP transgenic mice, many mesenchymal stem cells within the bone
marrow niche are fluorescently marked and can be used as

guide posts for identifying the same area in a second imaging
session. The authors show fascinating pictures, in which proliferating, previously transferred HSCs, build clusters of stem
cells only after stroke, but not after a sham procedure. In addition, the current work shows confocal imaging of increased
expression of tyrosine hydroxylase—a rate limiting enzyme in
norepinephrine synthesis—and its precise lining of bone marrow arterioles.
Beyond the basic science appeal, the current study may
contribute to a better understanding of and treatment for poststroke patients. One might propose that myeloid bias has been
shaped by evolution because it provides a benefit to the host.
It is not known whether this mechanism is protective or detrimental. One can speculate that an increased rate of infection
after myocardial infarction, or stroke, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and sepsis,13 would warrant an increased
frequency and surveillance activity of innate immune cells.
This hypothesis is supported by a study of Nguyen et al, who
demonstrate that Bmal1 (Arntl) suppresses monocyte mobilization by repressing chemokine expression, such as CCL2.
Notably, releasing monocytes from the bone marrow by inactivation of Bmal1 might directly contribute to host defense by
conferring protection from listeria monocytogenes.14 On the
other hand, stroke-associated monocytosis may represent a
less-functional, myeloid-biased and malignancy-predisposing
phenotype of the bone marrow as previously suggested.15,16
Monocyte released from the bone marrow are expected to aggravate reperfusion injury to the ischemic brain and worsen
neuronal survival. The authors of the current study are well
aware of this possible dichotomy and propose further studies
to fully understand the consequences of the myeloid deployment after stroke. It will also be challenging to decipher the
exact mechanism by which adrenergic signaling fuels HSC
proliferation. Functional loss of CXCL12 can explain why
HSCs are not retained in the niche any more—but how exactly
does adrenergic signaling cause increased myeloid cell proliferation as observed by the authors in their model? This may
indeed be explained by previous studies showing that adrenergic receptors are expressed on myeloid cells throughout different stages of myeloid differentiation to regulate activation,
motility, and proliferation, particularly of HSCs.17,18 Notably,
β3-receptors are restricted to bone marrow stromal cells,
whereas β2-receptors are highly expressed within the hematopoietic and the stromal compartment.7 Consistent with this,
the authors of the current study observed that genetic deletion of β3-adrenergic receptor abolishes the turnover of HSCs,
whereas downstream progenitor cells remained responsive to
norepinephrine. Whether this activation was dependent on
β2-receptor signaling and confined to monocyte progenitors
(and not lymphoid cells) was not tested, but the existence of
β2-receptors on both HSCs and monocyte precursors may
provide a plausible explanation for the effects observed. Also,
synergistic activation of both β2- and β3 receptors may be
required for the activation and proliferation of some, but not
of all subpopulations of bone marrow stem cells as previously
suggested.7 Conversely, it is also possible that the myeloid
bias observed in the current study is the result of a failure of

lymphoid progenitors to respond to the inflammatory stimuli,
resulting in overwhelming production of myeloid cells.
After stroke, the clinical outcome inversely correlates
with leukocytosis in some studies, proposing that preventing
monocytosis may be beneficial for patients.19 In the current
study, the authors suggest that at least some of the remote
catecholamine effects on the bone marrow are mediated by
β3-adrenergic signaling—a target accessible by existing
pharmacological strategies. However, whether modulation of
stress-associated bone marrow hyperactivity can be prevented
by β-blockers will have to be investigated in further studies.
In clinical practice, β-receptor blocking drugs with specificity for cardiac expressed β1-receptors have superseded earlier strategies using nonselective β1-/β2-blockers, which also
target β2-receptors in the GI-tract, bronchi, blood vessels,
and muscles. In particular, specific β1-blockers have proven
effective in the treatment of hypertension and after myocardial infarction. In this regard, blockade of cardiac β-receptors
can mitigate the effects of toxic levels of catecholamines in
the acute and chronic scenario and prolong life by preventing
heart failure.20 The new perspective now provided by Courties
et al may initiate a search for drugs that specifically target
the unwanted catecholamine signaling in HSCs and myeloid
precursors. Such drugs would need to target the bone marrow
or the myeloid limb of differentiating leukocyte precursors
because β3-receptors are widely expressed in other tissues,
including adipose tissue and the myocardium, where their inhibition could precipitate unwanted side effects.21
