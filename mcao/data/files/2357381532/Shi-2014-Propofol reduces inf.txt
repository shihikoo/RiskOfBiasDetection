Abstract Our previous studies demonstrated that inflammatory reaction and neuronal apoptosis are the most
important pathological mechanisms in ischemia-induced
brain damage. Propofol has been shown to attenuate
ischemic brain damage via inhibiting neuronal apoptosis.
The present study was performed to evaluate the effect of
propofol on brain damage and inflammatory reaction in rats
of focal cerebral ischemia. Sprague–Dawley rats underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, then
received treatment with propofol (10 or 50 mg/kg) or
vehicle after 2 h of ischemia. Neurological deficit scores,
cerebral infarct size and morphological characteristic were
measured 24 h after cerebral ischemia. The enzymatic
activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was assessed 24 h after
cerebral ischemia. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-jB) p65
expression in ischemic rat brain was detected by western
blot. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in ischemic
rat brain was determined by immunohistochemistry.
ELISA was performed to detect the serum concentration of
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). Neurological deficit
scores, cerebral infarct size and MPO activity were significantly reduced by propofol administration. Furthermore, expression of NF-jB, COX-2 and TNF-a were
attenuated by propofol administration. Our results demonstrated that propofol (10 and 50 mg/kg) reduces
inflammatory reaction and brain damage in focal cerebral
ischemia in rats. Propofol exerts neuroprotection against

Introduction
Ischemia-induced brain damage develops from a series of
pathological mechanisms including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, blood–brain barrier disruption, inflammatory
reaction and neuronal apoptosis [1]. Our previous studies
demonstrated that inflammatory reaction is one of the most
important pathological mechanisms in ischemic brain
damage [2, 3]. Inhibition of inflammatory reaction would
reduce ischemic brain damage in a rat model of permanent
focal cerebral ischemia [4, 5].
Propofol, one of the widely used anesthetic agents for
maintenance of anesthesia for surgical procedures, has also
been shown to attenuate brain damage in a rat model of
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury [6]. As we know,
animal models of focal cerebral ischemia comprise with
focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model and the permanent focal cerebral ischemia model [7]. There are some
different pathological mechanisms between the focal
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model and the permanent
focal cerebral ischemia model [8]. To our knowledge, it is
unclear that whether also propofol provides a neuroprotection in a rat model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia.
The present study was performed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of propofol on ischemic brain damage in
rats of permanent focal cerebral ischemia.

Several reports demonstrated that propofol has been
demonstrated to possess anti-inflammatory property in
some disease models. Chen et al. [9] showed that propofol
reduces the biosyntheses of inflammatory mediators such
as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1b (IL-1b),
IL-6 and nitric oxide in lipopolysaccharide-activated
macrophages. Sun et al. [10] demonstrated that propofol
inhibits the inflammatory mediators nuclear factor-kappa B
(NF-jB), TNF-a and IL-6 and provides the protective
effect on the intestine following traumatic brain injury in
rats. During aortic surgery, propofol was demonstrated to
protect renal function through modulation of the systemic
inflammatory reaction [11]. In cerebral ischemia, inflammatory reaction and inflammatory genes mediates the
pathophysiological processes of ischemic brain damage. In
the present study, we first try to investigate whether propofol provides a neuroprotection against brain injury in
permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats, then further
explored the effect of propofol on inflammatory reaction
and the potential molecular mechanisms.

Materials and Methods
Animal Model
All animal experiments were conducted according to the
National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. All surgical procedures were performed by sterile/aseptic techniques in accordance with
institutional guidelines. Clean adult male Sprague–Dawley
rats weighing 250–300 g were obtained from Shanghai
Laboratory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
Animals were housed in a colony room under controlled
temperature (22 °C), and a 12:12 light–dark cycle, with
food and water available. Rats were anesthetized with an
intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg)
and subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
described previously [12]. In brief, the right common carotid artery, external carotid artery (ECA) and internal
carotid artery (ICA) were carefully exposed through a
ventral midline neck incision. A 3-0 nylon monofilament
suture, whose tip was rounded by heating near a flame and
coated with silicone (0.32 mm diameter) was inserted from
the ECA into the ICA to occlude the origin of the right
middle cerebral artery (MCA). The suture was inserted
18–20 mm from the carotid bifurcation, confirmed with
mild resistance to occlude the MCA. Sham operation was
manipulated in the same way, but the MCA was not
occluded. During the surgery, rectal temperature was
controlled at 37 °C with a heating pad and warm light. Rats
were allowed to freely access to food and water after
recovery from anesthesia.

Experimental Groups
A total of 48 clean adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were
used in the present study. Rats were divided into four
groups (four rats in each group): (1) sham control group,
which underwent sham operation and received vehicle; (2)
MCAO group, which was subjected to MCAO and received
vehicle; (3) propofol 10 mg/kg group (P10), which was
subjected to MCAO and treated with propofol 10 mg/kg;
(4) propofol 50 mg/kg group (P50), which was subjected to
MCAO and treated with propofol 50 mg/kg. Rats were
treated with normal saline as the vehicle control at the
same volume as propofol.
Assessment of Neurological Deficit Scores
Neurological deficit scores were assessed at 24 h after
MCAO described previously [13]: 0, no observable deficit;
1, contralateral forelimb flexion; 2, decreased resistance to
lateral push without circling; 3, circling to the contralateral
side.
Assessment of Cerebral Infarct Size
Fresh rat brain was removed and coronally sliced into
2.0 mm-thick sections. Brain slices were incubated in 2 %
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (Amresco) for 20 min.
Cerebral infarct size was calculated according to the previous reports [14]. The degree of cerebral infarct size was
expressed as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere
size.
Biochemical Analysis
Neutrophil infiltration was evaluated by measuring the
enzymatic activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO). MPO
activity in ischemic rat brain was measured according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China). The results were expressed as
U/g tissue.
Histological Examination
The rats were euthanized with deep anesthesia and perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered
saline. Then the brains were removed, fixed and embedded
in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded sections (4 lm thick)
were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with graded alcohol for hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and
immunohistochemical analysis. For HE staining, coronal
sections were counterstained with HE. The sections were
visualized with a microscope (Olympus, Japan).

Western Blot

Results

Brain samples were used and total protein was extracted
using protein extraction kit (Beyotime Biotech. CO.,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein samples (50 lg) were separated on 10 % SDS polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes.
The membranes were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with a
mouse monoclonal antibody against NF-jB p65 (1:500,
Santa Cruz). The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated
with horseradish-peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000, KPL Inc) for 2 h at 25 °C and developed
with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(KPL Inc). GAPDH was used as a loading control. The
optical densities of protein bands were analyzed by the
Quantity one software (Bio-Rad).

Effect of Propofol on Neurological Deficit and Cerebral
Infarct Size

Immunohistochemical Analysis
For immunohistochemical analysis, the paraffin-embedded
sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated
with graded alcohol. Brain sections were incubated in 3 %
H2O2 for 15 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity.
After washing in PBS, sections were incubated overnight at
4 °C with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (1:100, Zhongshan Biotechnology Co.
Ltd, Beijing). Biotinylated mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Zhongshan Biotechnology Co. Ltd, Beijing) was used as a secondary antibody. Diaminobenzidine was used as a color
substrate. The sections were visualized with a microscope
(Olympus, Japan). Three random high area (2009) in periinfarct zone of rat brains were counted.

Sham-operated rats did not have any neurological deficit
scores and cerebral infarct size. Propofol 50 mg/kg significantly reduced neurological deficit scores 24 h after
MCAO (p \ 0.01, Fig. 1a), but propofol 10 mg/kg has not
difference (p [ 0.05, Fig. 1a). Both of propofol at 10 and
50 mg/kg reduced cerebral infarct size 24 h after MCAO
(p \ 0.05 and p \ 0.01, Fig. 1b).
Effect of Propofol on Neuronal Damage
HE staining showed the morphological characteristic of
sham-operated neuron vehicle-treated neuron and propofoltreated neuron in rat. No neuronal damage was observed in
sham-operated rats (Fig. 2a). Many injured neurons
appeared shrunken with triangulated pyknotic nuclei and
cavitation were observed after 24 h of MCAO, (Fig. 2b).
Experimental results showed that propofol (10 and 50 mg/
kg) attenuated the neuronal damage and necrotic neurons
24 h after MCAO (Fig. 2c, d).
Effect of Propofol on Neutrophil Infiltration
Experimental results demonstrated that the enzymatic
activity of MPO was increased 24 h after MCAO, which
was significantly attenuated by administration of propofol
50 mg/kg (p \ 0.01), but not 10 mg/kg (p [ 0.05, Fig. 3).

Measurement of Serum TNF-a
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, blood samples (1 ml)
were drawn from femoral vein of rats. After centrifugation
at 3,000 rpm for 15 min, the supernatant was collected and
stored at –80 °C in refrigerator. Serum contents TNF-a
were measured using a rat TNF-a ELISA kits according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Shanghai Xitang Biological Technology, China).
Statistical Analysis
Four rats in each group was used in this study, experimental data were presented as mean ± SD. Statistical
analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test for individual comparisons between group
means (SPSS13.0 for windows, USA). A value of p \ 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Effect of Propofol on NF-jB Expression
Experimental results showed that MCAO causes an
increased expression of NF-jB p65 following cerebral
ischemia in rats. The upregulated expression of p65 subunit
is an index of nuclear translocation. Propofol 50 mg/kg
inhibited the expression of NF-jB p65 by the method of
western blot analysis (p \ 0.05), but propofol 10 mg/kg
has not difference (p [ 0.05, Fig. 4).
Effect of Propofol on COX-2 Expression
Experimental results showed that MCAO caused an
increase of COX-2 immunopositive cells in rat brain 24 h
after cerebral ischemia. Propofol 50 mg/kg significantly
down-regulated the expression of COX-2 (p \ 0.05), but

vehicle-treated and propofol-treated groups were detected by western
blot (a), and the data were summarized in (b). Cerebral ischemia
caused an increased expression of NF-jB p65 (p \ 0.01), which was
significantly inhibited by propofol 50 mg/kg (p \ 0.05), but not
10 mg/kg (p [ 0.05). n = 4, pro 10 propofol 10 mg/kg, pro 50
propofol 50 mg/kg

propofol 10 mg/kg has not difference compared with
vehicle group (p [ 0.05, Fig. 5).
Effect of Propofol on Serum Content of TNF-a
Experimental results showed that serum TNF-a was
increased 24 h after MCAO, which was significantly
attenuated by propofol 50 mg/kg (p \ 0.05), but not propofol 10 mg/kg (p [ 0.05, Fig. 6).

The present study demonstrated that propofol, an anesthetic
agents for maintenance of anesthesia for surgical procedures, provides neuroprotective effect against ischemiainduced cerebral damage. Further study showed that propofol attenuates inflammatory reaction in rats of focal
cerebral ischemia. Moreover, propofol was demonstrated to
inhibit the expression of inflammatory signaling NF-jB/
COX-2/TNF-a.
Several reports demonstrated that propofol reduces
ischemic brain damage in rats [15–18]. Li et al. [15]
showed that propofol protects against cerebral ischemia
damage via inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, and propofol’s
anti-apoptotic property might be mediated by the inhibition
of caspase-3 expression and the increase of Bcl-2 expression. Xi et al. [16] demonstrated that propofol improves
neurobehavioral outcome in rats of cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion by regulating Bcl-2 and Bax expression. Cai
et al. [17] showed that propofol provides neuroprotective
effect against brain ischemia in rats, which might be
mediated by the glutamatergic signaling pathway. Taken
together, previous studies indicates that the neuroprotective
effect of propofol in ischemic brain damage is associated
with its anti-apoptotic property.
To our knowledge, inflammatory reaction and neuronal
apoptosis are the two most important pathological mechanisms in the processes of ischemic brain damage [19]. Propofol has been demonstrated to protect cerebral ischemia
damage via inhibiting neuronal apoptosis. Feng et al. [20]
showed that propofol could attenuate inflammation in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury. As reported earlier, there
are some different pathological mechanisms between the
focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model and the permanent focal cerebral ischemia model [8]. Therefore, it is
unknown that whether propofol reduces ischemic brain
damage via inhibiting inflammatory reaction in rats of permanent cerebral ischemia. This is the first paper, to our best
knowledge, indicating that propofol could inhibit inflammatory reaction and down-regulate the expression of
inflammatory signals in rats of permanent focal cerebral
ischemia.
In this study, we first demonstrated that the administration
of propofol significantly reduces neurological deficit scores,
cerebral infarct size and neuronal injury 24 h after permanent focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Then, we found that
propofol inhibits MPO activity in a rat model of permanent
focal cerebral ischemia. MPO was usually examined for
quantitative indication of neutrophil infiltration and
inflammatory reaction in previous study. Therefore, propofol reduces inflammatory reaction in rats of cerebral ischemia. Then, it is necessary to further investigate the potential
molecular mechanisms in the subsequent experiments.

NF-jB, an inflammatory transcription factor activated in
response to ischemic stroke, is known to mediated the
inflammatory processes in ischemic brain damage [21].
Inhibition of NF-jB attenuates brain damage in both
transient and permanent cerebral ischemia models, suggesting that NF-jB plays a detrimental role in ischemic
stroke [22]. In cerebral ischemia, NF-jB has been shown to
regulate the expression of downstream inflammatory genes
that contributes to the evolution of ischemic brain damage.
COX-2, an inflammatory enzyme that mediates the process
of ischemic brain damage, was over-expressed after focal
cerebral ischemia. TNF-a, an inflammatory cytokine that

123

also aggravates ischemic brain damage, was up-regulated
after focal cerebral ischemia.
In order to provide the molecular mechanisms underlying the propofol’s neuroprotection against ischemiainduced inflammatory reaction, we determined the effect of
propofol on the expression of inflammatory signaling NFjB/COX-2/TNF-a. The experimental results demonstrated
that propofol significantly inhibits the activity of NF-jB,
down-regulates the expression of COX-2 and reduces the
secretion of TNF-a following focal cerebral ischemia.
In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of propofol’s effect on inflammatory reaction and

neuroprotective effect of propofol in cerebral ischemia may
be associated with the inhibition of inflammatory reaction
