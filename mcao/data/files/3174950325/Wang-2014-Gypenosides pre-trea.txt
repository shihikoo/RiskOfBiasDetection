Gypenosides (GPs) have been reported to have neuroprotective effects in addition to other bioactivities. The protective activity of GPs during stroke and their effects on neural stem cells (NSCs) in the
ischemic brain have not been fully elucidated. Here, we test the effects of GPs during stroke and on the
NSCs within the subventricular zone (SVZ) of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. Our results
show that pre-treatment with GPs can reduce infarct volume and improve motor function following
MCAO. Pre-treatment with GPs signiﬁcantly increased the number of BrdU-positive cells in the ipsilateral and contralateral SVZ of MCAO rats. The proliferating cells in both sides of the SVZ were glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP)/nestin-positive type B cells and doublecortin (DCX)/nestin-positive type
A cells. Our data indicate that GPs have neuroprotective effects during stroke which might be mediated
through the enhancement of neurogenesis within the SVZ. These ﬁndings provide new evidence for a
potential therapy involving GPs for the treatment of stroke.

1. Introduction
MCAO in adult rodents results in an infarct that encompasses the
cerebral cortex and striatum on the occluded side of the brain. In
the adult brain, pathological processes, including cerebral ischemia,
can enhance neurogenesis. In the adult mammalian brain, NSCs are
located primarily in two areas: the subventricular zone (SVZ) of
the lateral ventricle and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus (Ming and Song, 2011; Taupin and Gage, 2002). Many studies
have reported a signiﬁcant enhancement in progenitor proliferation following MCAO in the SVZ and DG of adult rats and mice (Jin
et al., 2001; Kokaia and Lindvall, 2003; Komitova et al., 2002; Parent
et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2001). Newly generated neural precursors

from the SVZ migrate toward the areas of the brain that are injured
as a result of ischemia (Kokaia and Lindvall, 2003; Sun et al., 2004;
Thored et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2007). Some studies have reported
that the increase in SVZ neurogenesis appears to be associated with
cell replacement in the injured striatum (Arvidsson et al., 2002;
Hou et al., 2008; Kokaia and Lindvall, 2003; Parent et al., 2002;
Sun et al., 2004; Thored et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2007). No such
evidence exists to support a similar form of cell replacement in
the hippocampal dentate gyrus following stroke or other cerebral
insults (Lichtenwalner and Parent, 2006).
In the post-ischemic brain, many BrdU+/NeuN+ cells and a subset of BrdU+/DCX+ cells with the morphology of migrating neurons
can be seen at the infarct site (Arvidsson et al., 2002). By co-labeling
with BrdU and DCX and labeling SVZ cells with the ﬂuorescent
tracer DiI, the progenitor cells from the SVZ could be found to have
directly migrated to the striatum in the post-ischemic rat brain (Jin
et al., 2003). These newly generated cells can survive in the ipsilateral striatum and corpus callosum for more than 3 months. In all,
3–10% of the surviving cells were shown to express the immature
neuronal marker Class III␤-Tubulin (TuJ1) and mature neuronal
markers such as MAP-2 and NeuN 2–3 months after ischemia
(Gu et al., 2000; Jiang et al., 2001). Although the SVZ-derived

50

progenitors migrated into the damaged areas of the brain, many
newly formed cells were also found in the olfactory bulb (OB) following focal ischemia in primates, indicating that some cells still
follow their natural route of migration (Koketsu et al., 2006).
Gypenosides (GPs) are dammarane-type saponins that are
extracted from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb) Makino (Cucurbitaceae). The active component of gypenoside is the hydroxyl
group attached to the twentieth or twenty-ﬁrst carbon in the
dammarane-type ring (Shang et al., 2006). GPs are widely used
in Asia in traditional Chinese medicine. Studies have shown that
GPs have antioxidative stress effects in both primary cultures
of rat cortical cells treated by glutamate (Shang et al., 2006)
and in the cortex and hippocampal CA1 region in a rat model
of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (Zhang et al., 2011). Some
studies have shown that GPs have neuroprotective effects on
MPP+ -induced dopaminergic neurons in primary nigral cultures
(Wang et al., 2010b) and in the substantia nigra of mouse and
rat models of Parkinson’s disease (Choi et al., 2010; Wang et al.,
2010a). By using hippocampal slices, the ethanolic extract of G.
pentaphyllum has been shown to have protective effects from
hypoxia/hypoglycemia-induced injury (Schild et al., 2009, 2012).
GPs have been shown to decrease the damage to the DNA and
RNA of rat neurons in an acute global ischemia model (Qi et al.,
2000). However, it remains unknown whether GPs can reduce the
infarct volume in vivo and improve motor function in an ischemic
animal. This study investigated the protective effects of GPs during stroke and the activity of GPs on the NSCs within the SVZ of
MCAO rats.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental materials
Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 280–350 g were
used for the experiments and were obtained from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China). The rats were kept under standard lighting
conditions (12 h light/dark cycles). This study was approved by the
ethics committee of the School of Medicine of Shandong University.
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC) of Shandong University.
2.2. MCA occlusion model
SD rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate by intraperitoneal injection (3 mL/kg body weight). The left common carotid
arteries were identiﬁed and isolated through a ventral midline
cervical incision. A nylon ﬁlament (0.28 mm in diameter) with a
rounded tip was introduced from the common carotid artery lumen
into the internal carotid artery to block the origin of the left middle
cerebral artery (MCA). The left MCA was occluded with the ﬁlament
for 120 min, and the ﬁlament was withdrawn to allow for 24 h of
reperfusion. In the sham group, a left neck incision was made to
expose the arteries, but the nylon thread was not inserted into
internal carotid artery. The animals were returned to their home
cages following recovery from the anesthesia.
2.3. Study design in animal models
The rats were randomized into six groups: sham group (n = 13),
MCAO group (n = 11), the GPs 200 group treated with 200 mg/kg GPs
per day (sham + GPs 200, n = 5; MCAO + GPs 200 group, n = 9) and the
GPs 400 group treated with 400 mg/kg GPs per day (sham + GPs 400,
n = 5; MCAO + GPs 400 group, n = 9). The rats in the GPs 200 and GPs
400 groups were treated with different doses of GPs according to
their body weights by oral gavage. The rats were treated once a day

for 10 days before MCA occlusion. The rats in the sham and MCAO
groups received same amount of saline for 10 days.

2.4. Examination of neurological deﬁcits
The behavioral assays were scored using a modiﬁcation of
the system used by Bederson et al. (1986). The rats were examined after the 24-h reperfusion while suspended 20–30 cm above
the testing table and were scored according to the following
criteria: 0, rat extends both forelimbs straight; 1, rat keeps one
forelimb to the breast and extends the other forelimb straight;
2, rat shows decreased resistance to a lateral push without circling; 3, rat shows decreased resistance to a lateral push with
circling; and 4, rat loses spontaneous walking and consciousness. Rats scoring 0 or 4 were not used in the evaluation of this
experiment.

2.5. Evaluation of infarct volume
Twenty-four hours following reperfusion, the rats were killed
while under deep anesthesia. The brains were removed carefully
and sliced into 2.0 mm thick coronal sections. The fresh brain slices
were incubated in a 2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma)
in normal saline for 30 min at 37 ◦ C and then transferred to a 4%
paraformaldehyde solution for ﬁxation. After TTC staining, digital
photographs were taken. Areas of the infarct regions were analyzed
in NIH Image J. The infarct areas of each section were the average
of the sum of two sides. The volume of infarction for each animal
was calculated by taking the product of the average slice thickness
(2 mm) and summing the infarct areas in all brain slices. The results
were represented as the percentage of the total volume.

2.6. BrdU labeling
After MCAO, the rats were injected with BrdU by intraperitoneal
injection (Sigma, 50 mg/kg), four times at 2-h intervals. The rats
were killed 2 h after the last injection (n = 3 in each group). Nonsurgical rats in the sham group received the same injection of BrdU
and were killed at corresponding time points and used as control
groups. Rats were transcardially perfused with normal saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed and ﬁxed
in 4% paraformaldehyde.

2.7. Immunohistochemistry
Serial 40-␮m sagittal or coronal sections were cut with a cryostat and stored at −80 ◦ C. For BrdU immunostaining, DNA was
ﬁrst denatured by incubating brain sections in 50% formamide/2x
standard saline citrate at 65 ◦ C for 2 h and then in 2 N HCl at 37 ◦ C
for 30 min. After washing, sections were incubated with blocking
solution and then with a sheep polyclonal antibody against BrdU
(1:1000; Abcam) at 4 ◦ C overnight followed by an Alexa Fluor 594conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (1:1000; Invitrogen) in blocking
solution at room temperature for 2 h. For double immunolabeling of DCX/nestin and GFAP/nestin, the primary antibodies used
were mouse monoclonal anti-nestin (1:500; Millipore) and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (1:1000; Millipore) or anti-DCX (1:500;
Cell Signaling Technology). The secondary antibodies used were
Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (1:1000;
Invitrogen), Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L)
(1:1000; Invitrogen). Sections were mounted with Vectashield
(Vector) and 4 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to
counterstain the nuclei.

2.8. Microscopy analysis
Sagittal sections were serially cut at 40 ␮m thickness to cover
the whole SVZ. Every sixth section was collected for staining. Three
sets of sections of each rat were separately used for BrdU staining,
GFAP/nestin and DCX/nestin double staining. To quantify the BrdU
staining, GFAP/nestin and DCX/nestin double labeling, images were
digitally captured using a Nikon 80i light microscope equipped with
a CCD camera under a 20× objective. Images were imported into
NIH Image J for blinded cell counting. The number of BrdU-positive,
GFAP/nestin double positive and DCX/nestin double positive cells
was counted in the SVZ of per rat in each groups (n = 3).
2.9. Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean ± SEM, and the statistical signiﬁcance was determined using the Student’s t test or one-way ANOVA.
The differences were considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05.

51

rats, no infarct volume was observed. A signiﬁcantly greater infarct
volume was observed in the MCAO group after a 24-h reperfusion (17.3 ± 0.12%). After the MCAO operation, the pre-treatment
with the low or high dose of GPs decreased the infarct volume
to 14.52 ± 1.22% and 10.06 ± 2.63%, respectively. The group pretreated with GPs (400 mg/kg/day) showed a signiﬁcant reduction
in infarct volume compared to the MCAO group (Fig. 1B).
3.2. Neurological deﬁcits
Neurological deﬁcits were assessed at 2 h of ischemia/24 h
of reperfusion. The sham-operated rats achieved a score of
0 in the four-score system. The neurological deﬁcit score
was signiﬁcantly higher in the MCAO group (1.64 ± 0.24). The
groups pre-treated with GPs showed reductions in the neurological scores to 1.44 ± 0.24 and 1 ± 0, respectively. The
group pre-treated with GPs (400 mg/kg/day) showed a signiﬁcant reduction in neurological deﬁcit scores compared to the
MCAO group (Fig. 1C).

few BrdU+ cells in the SVZ of the bilateral side in sham-operated
rats. There were signiﬁcantly more BrdU+ cells in the bilateral
SVZ of the MCAO group compared to the sham group (ipsilateral:
63.33 ± 7.36 vs. 7 ± 1.53; contralateral: 60.67 ± 18.00 vs. 3.6 ± 0.40;
Fig. 2B and C). The groups pre-treated with GPs had a greater number of BrdU+ cells in both sides of the SVZ compared to the MCAO
group, particularly in the case of the group pre-treated with GPs
(400 mg/kg/day) (ipsilateral: 135.6 ± 12.45 vs. 63.33 ± 7.36; contralateral: 110.25 ± 9.80 vs. 60.67 ± 18.00). Our data indicate that
GPs can promote cellular proliferation within the SVZ following
MCAO.
3.4. GFAP+/nestin+ cells in the SVZ
To test whether GPs can promote the proliferation of NSCs,
we further investigated the expression patterns of GFAP and
nestin, a member of the intermediate ﬁlament protein family
that is expressed by neuroepithelial precursor cells (Kaneko et al.,

2000; Lendahl et al., 1990), within proliferating cells of the SVZ.
The combination of GFAP and nestin was used to label NSCs
(type B cells) of SVZ (Doetsch et al., 1997). There were a few
GFAP/nestin-positive cells in the SVZ of the sham-operated rats
(ipsilateral: 45.33 ± 1.20; contralateral: 48.67 ± 0.67; Fig. 3A–C).
Following MCAO, the number of GFAP/nestin-positive cells in the
SVZ increased to 84.50 ± 15.50 (ipsilateral) and 76.50 ± 3.50 (contralateral), but there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences
compared to the sham group (Fig. 3A–C). Compared to the MCAO
group, the groups pre-treated with GPs had a signiﬁcant increase
in the number of GFAP/nestin-positive cells in both sides of the SVZ
(ipsilateral: MCAO + GPs 200 group 158.67 ± 4.67 vs. 84.5 ± 15.50;
MCAO + GPs 400 group 275.33 ± 19.70 vs. 84.5 ± 15.50; contralateral side: MCAO + GPs 200 group 163.33 ± 10.14 vs. 76.50 ± 3.50;
MCAO + GPs 400 group 270.50 ± 29.50 vs. 76.50 ± 3.50; Fig. 3A–C).
Our data indicate that GPs can promote the proliferation of
GFAP/nestin-positive NSCs (type B cells) within the SVZ of MCAO
rats.

3.5. DCX+/nestin+ cells in the SVZ
Next, we aimed to identify whether GPs can promote the differentiation of NSCs into neuroblasts within the SVZ by using doublelabel immunohistochemistry. DCX (an immature neuronal marker)
combined with nestin was used to label neuroblasts (type A cells) in
the SVZ (Doetsch et al., 1997). There were a few DCX/nestin-positive
cells in the SVZ of sham-operated rats (ipsilateral: 36.50 ± 6.25;

contralateral: 33.5 ± 6.94; Fig. 4A–C). The number of DCX/nestinpositive cells in both sides of the SVZ was increased signiﬁcantly following MCAO (ipsilateral: 82.67 ± 10.17 vs. 36.5 ± 6.25; contralateral: 66.67 ± 8.82 vs. 33.5 ± 6.94; Fig. 3A–C). Compared to the MCAO
group, the groups pre-treated with GPs had a signiﬁcantly greater
number of DCX/nestin-positive cells in both sides of the SVZ (ipsilateral: MCAO + GPs 200 group 169.33 ± 10.98 vs. 82.67 ± 10.17;
MCAO + GPs 400 group 211.67 ± 25.18 vs. 82.67 ± 10.17; contralateral: MCAO + GPs 200 group 139.33 ± 9.94 vs. 66.67 ± 8.82;

MCAO + GPs 400 group 147.00 ± 6.24 vs. 66.67 ± 8.82; Fig. 3A–C).
Our data indicate that GPs can increase the numbers of DCX/nestinpositive neuroblasts (type A cells) within the SVZ of MCAO rats.
3.6. The effect of GPs on the neurogenesis within the SVZ in the
sham rats
In order to identify the effect of pre-treatment with GPs on
the neurogenesis within the SVZ in the sham rats, we did BrdU
staining, GFAP/nestin and DCX/nestin double staining in the GPs
treated sham rats. Firstly for the BrdU staining, there were a few
BrdU+ cells in the SVZ of the left brain in sham-operated rats. The
groups pre-treated with GPs had a greater number of BrdU+ cells
in the left SVZ compared to the sham group (sham + GPs 200 group
53.71 ± 5.38 vs. 10.67 ± 1.31, sham + GPs 400 group 94.14 ± 16.32
vs. 10.67 ± 1.31; Fig. 5A and B). For the GFAP/nestin double staining, there were a few GFAP/nestin-positive cells in the left SVZ of
the sham-operated rats (49.67 ± 2.76; Fig. 5C and D). Compared to
the sham group, the groups pre-treated with GPs had a signiﬁcant
increase in the number of GFAP/nestin-positive cells in the left SVZ
(sham + GPs 200 group 77.83 ± 7.53 vs. 49.67 ± 2.76; sham + GPs
400 group 121.50 ± 9.11 vs. 49.67 ± 2.76; Fig. 5C and D). For the
DCX/nestin double staining, there were a few DCX/nestin-positive
cells in the SVZ of sham-operated rats (31.33 ± 4.31; Fig. 5E and
F). Compared to the sham group, the groups pre-treated with GPs
had a signiﬁcantly greater number of DCX/nestin-positive cells in
the left SVZ (sham + GPs 200 group 61.17 ± 8.06 vs. 31.33 ± 4.31;
sham + GPs 400 group 79.33 ± 5.70 vs. 31.33 ± 4.31; Fig. 5E and
F). Our data showed that GPs pre-treatment can also promote
the proliferation of GFAP/nestin-positive NSCs (type B cells) and
DCX/nestin-positive neuroblasts (type A cells) within the SVZ in
the GPs pre-treated rats without MCAO. These suggested that GPs
pre-treatment can promote the neurogenesis within the SVZ in the
sham rats.
4. Discussion
In the present study, we evaluated the protective effects of GPs
(200 mg/kg/day and 400 mg/kg/day) on MCAO rats and the activity
of GPs on NSCs of the SVZ in MCAO rats. The present data provide
the ﬁrst evidence that GPs (400 mg/kg/day) can signiﬁcantly reduce
infarct volume and improve motor function in MCAO rats, and GPs
can promote the cell proliferation of SVZ in the MCAO rats. The cells
that are increased are GFAP/nestin-positive NSCs (type B cells) and
DCX/nestin-positive neuroblasts (type A cells) within the SVZ.
Like other drugs, GPs have the effect of accumulation for multiple usages. In the cell culture system, studies have shown that
GPs pre-treatment had stronger neuroprotective effect than GPs
co-treatment or post-treatment at different GPs concentrations, not
only for rat cortical cells treated by glutamate but also for MPP+ induced dopaminergic neurons (Shang et al., 2006; Wang et al.,
2010b). In an acute global ischemia model, GPs pre-treatment has
been shown to decrease the damage to the DNA and RNA of rat
neurons (Qi et al., 2000). These studies suggest that GPs have preventive effects more than therapeutic effects. In our experiments,
we pre-treated the rats with different concentration of GPs before
MCAO.
Ischemic stroke resulting from MCAO triggers an increase in cellular proliferation within the SVZ (Arvidsson et al., 2001, 2002;
Jin et al., 2001; Komitova et al., 2002; Parent et al., 2002; Zhang
et al., 2001, 2004). The proliferating cells observed in the SVZ
were labeled by an injection of BrdU using a pulse or a cumulative
protocol. Although the time course of the BrdU injections varied
across different experiments, an increase in BrdU-positive cells was
observed in all MCAO models. In our study, BrdU was injected 4

times with an interval 2 h following 2 h of MCAO. The numbers of
BrdU-positive cells in the SVZ of sham and MCAO groups were in
line with previous studies (Arvidsson et al., 2001; Jin et al., 2001).
The group pre-treated with GPs (400 mg/kg/day) showed signiﬁcantly more BrdU-positive cells in the SVZ.
Following MCAO, the proliferating cells in the SVZ were reported
to be neuroblasts or neural stem/progenitor cells (Jin et al., 2001;

There are multiple cell types that coexist within the SVZ of adult
mice: type A cells (neuroblasts), type B cells (B1 and B2 astrocytes that function as NSCs), type C cells (proliferating putative
precursors), type D cells (tanycytes) and type E cells (ependymal
cells) (Doetsch et al., 1997). The architecture and cell types of the

X.-J. Wang et al. / Int. J. Devl Neuroscience 33 (2014) 49–56

adult SVZ have been gradually modiﬁed by newly found evidence
based on the original model (Chojnacki et al., 2009; Doetsch et al.,
1999, 2002; Mirzadeh et al., 2008; Shen et al., 2008). All of the
SVZ models are derived from mouse studies; however, rats are
the most commonly used species in studies of adult neurogenesis
in stroke models (Arvidsson et al., 2002). Although the cytoarchitecture of the SVZ is similar between mice and rats, the transient
amplifying precursor cells (type C cells) could not be detected
in rats by using electron microscopy with gold and ﬂuorescence
immunolabeling (Danilov et al., 2009). We sought to understand
which speciﬁc types of proliferating cells could be promoted by
GPs. We used double-labeling immunohistochemistry to identify
the speciﬁc cell types. From our data, GFAP/nestin-positive NSCs
(type B cells) and DCX/nestin-positive neuroblasts (type A cells)
were signiﬁcantly increased in the SVZ of rats pre-treated with
GPs. Although the GFAP/nestin-positive NSCs (type B cells) in the
MCAO rats showed a trend toward an increase compared to the
sham group, the difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.
This could be explained by an increase in the differentiation of
NSCs into DCX/nestin-positive neuroblasts (type A cells), which
can migrate into the infarct areas and become mature neurons
following MCAO.
The BrdU-positive, GFAP/nestin-positive and DCX/nestinpositive cells were signiﬁcantly increased in both ipsilateral and
controlateral SVZ in the GPs pretreatment MCAO rats. There was
no signiﬁcant difference between the two sides. In order to explore
the effect of GPs on neurogenesis deeply, we performed the GPs
pre-treatment in the sham rats. The effects of GPs pre-treatment on
the sham rats were investigated by BrdU labeling and GFAP/nestin
and DCX/nestin double labeling. And found that the BrdU-positive,
GFAP/nestin-positive and DCX/nestin-positive cells were signiﬁcantly increased within the SVZ in the GPs pre-treatment sham rats.
All the data indicated that the pre-treatment with GPs can promote
the neurogenesis in the sham rats. In the MCAO rats, the neurogenesis in the SVZ was signiﬁcantly enhanced by the synergetic effect
of MCAO combined with GPs.
In conclusion, this study is the ﬁrst to reveal that GPs can reduce
infarct volume, improve motor function and promote cellular proliferation in the SVZ following the MCAO in rats. GPs can promote
the increasing of NSCs and promote the differentiation of NSCs
into neuroblasts within the SVZ of MCAO rats. Our results provide
new evidence that the neuroprotective effects of GPs during stroke
which might be mediated through the enhancement of the neurogenesis within the SVZ. Further studies exploring the mechanisms
underlying the effects of GPs on NSCs may lead to a better understanding of the potential for therapies using GPs in the treatment
of the stroke.
