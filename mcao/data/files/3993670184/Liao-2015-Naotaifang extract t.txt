Abstract. The expression of Ferroportin (Fpn) was examined
at different time points in rats following focal cerebral ischemia treated with or without the traditional Chinese medicine
Naotaifang. Initially, rats were randomly divided into 2, 6, 12,
24 and 72 h groups following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and the mRNA and protein level of Fpn was
detected by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) at the above time points.
Secondly, the rats were randomly divided into five groups as
follows: Sham surgery group, model group, low‑dose group
(3 g/kg NTE), medium dose group (9 g/kg NTE) and the
high‑dose group (27 g/kg NTE). After 3 days of corresponding
therapy by intragastric administration once a day, the regional
cerebral ischemia model was reproduced by the MCAO
suture method. On the third day, the neurological behavior
of the rats was analyzed by neurobehavioral assessment. Fpn
in the hippocampal CA2 region was measured by immunohistochemistry and the mRNA level of Fpn was detected by
RT‑PCR. Expression of Fpn in the hippocampal CA2 region
reached a peak 12 h after surgery (P<0.05, compared with the
model group). The high‑dose group (27 g/kg NTE) exhibited a
lower neurological behavior score (P<0.05) and a higher level
of expression of Fpn at the mRNA and protein level compared
with the sham surgery group and model group (P<0.05).
Dysregulation of intracellular iron balance is possibly a new
mechanism underlying cerebral ischemia. NTE can protect
the neuronal population in the hippocampal CA2 region by
adjusting the expression of Fpn to balance iron levels following
cerebral ischemia.

Introduction
Cerebral ischemia is a condition in which there is insufficient blood flow to the brain caused by cerebral vasospasm
or an embolism. Previous studies have demonstrated that
cerebral ischemia triggers a cascade of pathophysiological
events, including glutamate‑dependent excitotoxicity, calcium
overload, apoptosis, inflammation, free radical formation,
nitric oxide production and mitochondrial damage, leading
to neuronal cell death (1‑5). Through investigating the
mechanism underlying cerebral ischemic injury, a theoretical
basis for clinical treatment can be proposed and may have
far‑reaching significance for the prevention and treatment of
cerebral ischemia (6).
Iron is an essential trace element in the human body. It
is involved in synthesis of the myelin sheath and neurotransmission. Iron is also a type of catalyst, which increases the
concentration of reactive oxygen species. The increased
production of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation
damages neurons in cerebral ischemia (7,8). Cerebral hypoxia
leads to iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation in oligodendrocytes in one‑day old Wistar rats during development (7).
Whether iron accumulation and overload in neurons following
cerebral ischemic injury is a novel mechanism requires further
investigation.
Iron is composed of heme and non‑heme iron in the
human body (9). Heme iron is required for the synthesis of
heme. Intracellular heme iron can increase heme oxygenase 1
expression and lead to oxidative stress and cell membrane
damage (10). Non‑heme iron is involved in cell respiration and
catalyzing antibody production (11). Serum ferritin is a marker
of the body's non‑heme iron store (12). Hepcidin is secreted
by the liver and is important in the regulation of iron transport (13). Mutation of the gene BCS1L leads to a mitochondrial
disorder and elevated serum ferritin (14). Accumulation of
iron is observed in various neurodegenerative disorders,
including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease (15). Excess
iron increases ROS expression and activates the caspase
protein family, which contributes to apoptosis. The presence
of excess iron is therefore recognized as a major risk factor
for neurodegenerative diseases (16-17). Previous studies have
demonstrated that patients undergoing transfusion therapy are

4048

at risk of iron overload with associated tissue damage (15‑17).
Hyperferritinemia and increased iron stores are associated
with the severity of liver damage in non‑alcoholic fatty liver
disease (18). Iron overload and oxidative stress are involved
in the endometriosis‑associated inflammatory reaction (19).
Certain characteristics of metabolic syndrome are mainly
attributed to iron overload (20). As a type of non‑heme iron
export protein (21‑23), ferroportin (Fpn) is abundant in the small
intestine and macrophages (24). Previous studies demonstrated
that Fpn is also expressed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex,
thalamus, brainstem and cerebellum (25,26). Hepcidin binds
to Fpn and promotes its internalization and degradation. Fpn
disease, the most common non‑HFE hereditary iron‑loading
disorder, is caused by a loss of iron export function of Fpn
resulting in early and preferential iron accumulation in kupffer
cells and macrophages (27). Schulz et al found that astrocytes
can secrete Fpn to promote remyelination following axonal
injury (28). Certain studies have proposed that inflammatory
cytokines alter the expression of Fpn resulting in iron accumulation (29). Fpn can therefore respond to intraneural non‑heme
iron metabolism in cerebral ischemia.
Traditional Chinese medicine has made certain achievements for cerebral ischemia (30‑32). Naotaifang extract (NTE)
is an extract of a traditional Chinese medicine compound,
which improves blood circulation. A previous study demonstrated that NTE is clinically effective for the treatment of
cerebral ischemia and the therapeutic mechanism includes
anticoagulation and angiogenesis (33).
In order to reveal the dysregulation of intracellular iron
and examine the mechanisms underlying cerebral brain,
the present study investigated the expression of Fpn in the
hippocampal CA2 region cells following induction of cerebral
ischemia in rats treated with NTE.
Materials and methods
Animals. A total of 100 healthy adult male Sprague Dawley
rats weighing 220‑250 g (SPF grade) were provided by the
Experimental Animal Center of Hunan University of Chinese
Medicine (Changsha, China). The study was approved by
the ethics committee of the College of Traditional Chinese
Medicine (Changsha, China).
Drugs. NTE consists of astragalus root, chuanxiong and
dilong. The extract was acquired by water decoction and
alcohol extraction. The active ingredients include astragaloside, ligustrazine and ferulic acid (extracted by pharmaceutical
preparation at the Department of Hunan Traditional Chinese
Medicine University) mixed with physiological saline to
achieve the required concentration.
Experiment one. A total of 50 healthy male Sprague Dawley
rats were assigned to the 2 h group (n=10), 6 h group (n=10),
12 h group (n=10), 24 h group (n=10) and 72 h group (n=10)
using a random digits table. The rats were used to establish the
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model.
Experiment two. A total of 50 healthy male Sprague Dawley
rats were assigned to either the sham surgery group (n=10) or
the surgery group (n=40) using a random digits table. The rats

in the surgery group were used to establish the MCAO model.
According to the postoperative treatment, the surgery group
was divided into the model group (0.9% NaCL), low‑dose
group (3 g/g NTE), medium dose group (9 g/kg NTE) and
high‑dose group (27 g/kg NTE). Each group was treated with
the corresponding dose through intragastric administration for
the following three days after surgery. The animal specimens
were collected 72 h after surgery.
Animal modeling. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by
intra‑arterial suture occlusion of the right middle cerebral
artery (MCA) (34). MCAO was induced by using the intraluminal filament technique. Right common and external
carotid arteries were ligated and the internal carotid artery
was closed. A fish wire (d= 0.28 mm) was advanced through
the right internal carotid artery to the origin of the MCA. The
sham group was treated identically, with the exception that no
intraluminal filament was insert into the MCA. Neurological
assessment was used to confirm successful MCAO. Following
surgery (35), the cerebral cortex and hippocampus CA2 area
exhibited marked neuronal damage on the right side.
Neurobehavioral assessment. Neurobehavioral scores
were assessed in each animal following the final treatment
at 72 h. A modification of a previous method was used to
evaluate the neurological deficit (36). The five categories of
motor neurological findings were scored: 0, no observable
symptom; 1, contralateral forelimb flexion; 2, contralateral
circling; 3, tumble contralateral side; 4, unable to walk, loss
of consciousness.
Preparation of tissue slices. All rats were perfused with
paraformaldehyde (4%; Sigma‑Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) under anesthesia and fixed at different time points
(2, 6, 12, 24 and 72 h) following brain ischemia. The brains
were then removed and fixed for 1 h, washed with sodium
chloride (Sigma‑Aldrich), dehydrated with gradient alcohol
(Sigma‑Aldrich), embedded in paraffin (Sigma‑Aldrich) and
sectioned in 4 µm thick coronal sections.
Immunohistochemical staining and image analysis. Paraffin
sections were incubated at 60˚C for 30 min, then dewaxed
in xylene (Sigma‑Aldrich) and gradient alcohol. Slides
were soaked in a solution of 3% H 2O2 (Sigma‑Aldrich) for
10 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidases. Rabbit‑anti‑rat Fpn monoclonal antibody (1:100;

for 2 h at 37˚C. The sections were washed three times in
0.01 mol/l phosphate‑buffered saline (PBS; Sigma‑Aldrich)
for 5 min. The sections were placed in wet boxes and incubated for 40 min at 37˚C with polyclonal biotin‑labeled goat
anti‑rabbit IgG (cat no. PV‑600; Proteintech). Subsequently,
the sections were washed twice in PBS for 5 min and stained
with 3,3'‑diaminobenzidine (Sigma‑Aldrich). The sections
were then observed under an optical microscope (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan). Five sections were randomly selected from
each slice. Image analysis was performed using Image Pro
Plus 5.0 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD,
USA) to determine the integral optical density (IOD) of Fpn
positive areas in each visual field (magnification, x400) and
an average was calculated.

3 µl of synthesized cDNA with 10 µl 2X PCR mix, 1 µl of each
primer, 4 µl of PCR buffer and ddH2O to give a total reaction
volume of 20 µl. All common components were added to a
master mix (Takara, Dalian, China) and then aliquoted. The
cycling conditions were as follows: Initial denaturation at 94˚C
for 4 min followed by 28 cycles of 94˚C for 15 sec, 56˚C for
30 sec, 72˚C for 30 sec and a final extension at 72˚C for 5 min.
The primers of Fpn were designed (Table I) and Actin was
used as a loading control.

Expression of Fpn mRNA detected by RT‑PCR. At different time
points following surgery or 72 h after NTE treatment, 100 mg
tissue was extracted from the hippocampus using 1 ml TRIzol
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA was
reverse transcribed in a final volume of 10 µl containing 1 µg
of total RNA, 1 µl oligo (dT), 10 mM of each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (2 µl), 20 units RNasin, 200 units AMV

Statistical analysis. All data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation and were statistically analyzed using SPSS 11.0
software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The two‑sample
t‑test was used for comparison among groups. P<0.05 was
considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.

Experiment one. The expression of Fpn was detected using
immunohistochemistry and RT‑PCR in the hippocampal CA2
region, at different time points following induction of cerebral ischemia. The results from the immunohistochemistry
experiments showed that the darkest staining was observed at
12 h while the changes were less marked in the 2, 6, 24 and
72 h groups (Fig. 1A). RT‑PCR demonstrated similar results;
after 12 h treatment, the expression of Fpn was significantly

increased compared with the time points (P<0.05; Fig. 1B).
The RT‑PCR analysis also supported the results that only
the 12 h treatment group demonstrated a significant increase
among all the groups (P<0.05; Fig. 2).
Experiment two. Compared with the sham surgery group, the
surgery group exhibited a higher neurological behavior score
(P<0.05) and compared with the model group, the high‑dose
group exhibited a lower neurological behavior score (P<0.05;
Fig. 3).
The immunohistochemical results suggested that
following treatment with 3 g/kg NTE, the expression of
Fpn increased significantly compared with the other treatment doses (P<0.05). However, no significant changes were
observed among other groups (P>0.05; Fig. 4). The RT‑PCR
analysis also supported the results that only the 12 h treatment group demonstrated a significant increase among all
the groups (P<0.05; Fig. 5).
Discussion
Fpn is a type of non‑heme iron exporter protein in the cell
membrane. It can be internalized and degraded by binding to
hepcidin. The present study demonstrated that expression of
Fpn in the hippocampal CA2 region was increased following
occlusion of the right MCA, reaching a peak at 12 h, and
then decreasing to a minimum at 72 h. The present study
demonstrated that intraneural iron metabolism is imbalanced
in cerebral ischemia. In addition, the results demonstrate that
cellular iron accumulation promotes the expression of Fpn.
Iron metabolism imbalance can promote cellular iron efflux.
Intracellular iron accumulation may promote the expression
of Fpn by a variety of signaling pathways (37). In the present
study, following 12 h, intracellular iron efflux increased due to
iron overload, however, compensatory adjustment of neurons
was limited. After 12 h, the expression of Fpn reduced and
iron outflow decreased. The accumulation of iron leads to

the increased production of reactive oxygen species and lipid
peroxidation, which may damage neurons (38). Thus, it was
proposed that if a drug intervention can maintain high Fpn
expression following cerebral ischemia, then it may regulate
iron metabolism to reduce the damaging effect.
NTE is a traditional Chinese extract that promotes the
recovery of neurological function and improvement of blood
circulation (39). NTE consists of astragalus root, chuanxiong
and dilong. Previous studies have demonstrated that Astragalus
may reduce the expression of HIF-1a (hypoxia inducible
factor‑1a), which protects hippocampal neurons following
ischemic brain damage (40). Astragalus may reduce apoptosis in hippocampal neurons through reducing the cellular
malondialdehyde and nitric oxide content, thus increasing the
activity of superoxide dismutase (41). The active ingredients
of chuanxiong contain ligustrazine and ferulic acid (42).
Animal experiments have demonstrated that ligustrazine may
stimulate neurogenesis following focal cerebral ischemia (43).
Previous studies have indicated that ferulic acid may enhance
the expression of GABAB1 receptors at 3 h of reperfusion
and thereby provide neuroprotection (44). All components
in NTE work together in order to promote blood circulation
and improve the recovery of neurological function following
cerebral ischemia.
Previous studies have demonstrated that Astragalus
polysaccharide can prevent neuronal apoptosis following
cerebral ischemia (32). Ferulic acid has a neuroprotective
effect by promoting the formation of nitric oxide in rat
cerebral ischemia (32). Previous studies have verified that
NTE is clinically effective for the treatment of cerebral
ischemia (45,46). The therapeutic mechanism includes anticoagulation and angiogenesis. Experiment one demonstrated
that Fpn expression was reduced to the lowest point 72 h after
cerebral ischemia, therefore, in experiment two the animal
specimens were produced at the same time point following
NTE intervention. The present study demonstrated that a
high dose of NTE can increase the expression of Fpn in the
hippocampal CA2 region. The traditional Chinese medicine
NTE can enhance the expression of Fpn, increase iron excretion in neurons and reduce neuronal oxidative damage caused

that NTE can protect the neurons in the hippocampal CA2

region by increasing the expression of Fpn and promoting
neuronal iron efflux in cerebral ischemia.
