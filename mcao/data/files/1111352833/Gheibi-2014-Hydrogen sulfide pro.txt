Abstract Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a well-known toxic gas, is
regarded as endogenous neuromodulator and plays multiple
roles in the central nervous system under physiological and
pathological states, especially in secondary neuronal injury.
Recent studies have shown relatively high concentrations of
hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the brain and also cytoprotective
effects of endogenous and exogenous H2S in models of
in vitro and in vivo ischemic injury. H2S protects neurons by
functioning as an anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic mediator and by improving neurological function.
Moreover, it protects neurons from glutamate toxicity.
Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether
H2S provides protection in transient focal cerebral ischemia.
Focal ischemia was induced by 60-min middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO), followed by 23-h reperfusion. Saline as a

vehicle and NaHS (H2S donor; 1 and 5 mg) were intraperitoneally injected (IP) at the beginning of ischemia. Infarct
volume, brain edema, and apoptosis were assessed 24 h after
MCAO.
Treatment with NaHS at doses of 1 and 5 mg markedly
reduced total infarct volumes by 29 and 51 %, respectively
(P<0.001). In addition, NaHS at doses of 1 and 5 mg reduced
brain edema (P<0.05) and inhibited apoptosis by decreasing
positive TUNEL cells (P<0.001).
The present study shows that treatment with H2S reduces
brain injuries and postischemic cerebral edema in a dosedependent manner likely through the blocking programmed
cell death.
We propose that H2S might be a promising therapeutic
target for stroke, although more researches are necessary to
take into account the potential therapeutic effects of H2S in
stroke patients.

Introduction
An abundance of experimental evidence suggests that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays a prominent role in various physiological and pathological functions (Wang 2002; Tan et al.
2010). This small molecules freely diffuse through cell and
modulate many cellular functions through an array of intracellular signaling processes. Therefore, many therapeutic targets exist for H2S therapy. The molecular targets of H2S
include proteins, enzymes, transcription factors, and membrane ion channels. Moreover, it has shown that H2S plays
an important role in neurological, cardiovascular,

J Mol Neurosci (2014) 54:264–270

gastrointestinal, and endocrine systems where it is suggested
to have modulatory and cytoprotective effects (Szabó 2007).
Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies have been shown
the cytoprotective effects of both endogenous and exogenous
H2S on the animal models of ischemic injury (Kimura and
Kimura 2004; Bian et al. 2006; Sivarajah et al. 2006; Florian
et al. 2008). Several studies have estimated that the decrease in
both infarct size and also arrhythmias could be due mostly to
the cytoprotective effects of H2S on myocardial. Furthermore,
H2S has been shown to attenuate the extent of cellular apoptosis and necrosis following ischemia-reperfusion in a number of organs including the heart, lung, kidney, and liver
ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury (Johansen and Ytrehus
2006; Bian et al. 2006).
Recent studies in the field of neuronal protection show that
physiological concentrations of H 2 S enhance NMDA
receptor-mediated responses and induction of hippocampal
long-term potentiation (Abe and Kimura 1996). Moreover,
neuronal mitochondria have many favorable effects on
cytoprotection (Kimura and Kimura 2004).
In addition, H2S protects neuron from oxidative stress
injury, and also, it is capable to attenuate lipopolysaccharide
(LPS)-induced neuroinflammation in microglia (Florian et al.
2008).
Recent studies have shown that H2S attenuates neuronal
injury induced by vascular dementia (VD) in the hippocampus
and improves learning and memory functions by inhibiting
the apoptosis (Zhang et al. 2009). Therefore, H2S is now
recognized to be cytoprotective in various models of cellular
injury. (Jha et al. 2008; Yin et al. 2009).
In the central nervous system, H2S is endogenously produced and functions not only as a neuromodulator, but also as
a neuroprotectant against oxidative stress (Tyagi et al. 2009)
Moreover, it protects neurons from glutamate toxicity. (Lu
et al. 2008). Further roles of exogenous H2S in the central
nervous system include improvement of neurological function, reduction of apoptotic proteins expression, and antiapoptotic proteins activation (Minamishima et al. 2009).
However, the effect of H2S on focal cerebral ischemiareperfusion is still unknown. Furthermore, the protective
mechanism that H2S induced cytoprotection has not been
completely elucidated. The present study aimed to evaluate
the protective mechanism of this molecule on focal cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion.

Materials and Methods
Animals and Drugs
Male Wistar rats weighting 260–300 g were purchased from
Tehran Pasteur Institute and housed in standard cages with
controlled environment (22 °C–24 °C, 45–50 % humidity and

265

12 h light–dark cycle), along with free access to food and
water. All experiments were performed in accordance with the
Helsinki declaration. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), triphenyl
tetrazolium chloride (TTC), and chloral hydrate were obtained
from Sigma.

Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Applying intraluminal filament method middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) was induced (Vakili et al. 2005; Khaksari
et al. 2012). In order to conduct the proper experiments, the
rats were anesthetized using chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, intraperitoneally injected (IP)). It is noteworthy that their rectal
temperature was maintained at 36.5 °C±0.5 °C throughout the
surgery using a feedback-regulated heating system.
Furthermore, by applying the intraluminal suture method,
focal cerebral ischemia was induced. A 3–0 nylon suture
(Ethicon, Johnsons & Johnsons Intl, Brussels, Belgium),
while its tip was rounded by heating it at near a flame, was
introduced into the internal carotid artery through a nick
given-in the external carotid artery and advanced 18–20 mm
from the common carotid artery bifurcation to block the origin
of middle cerebral artery (MCA). Then, after 1 h of MCAO,
the intraluminal suture was gently removed so as to allow
reperfusion. It should be mentioned that for 24 h, the animals
were kept in individual cages with free access to food and
water.

Infarct Volume Assessment
The rats were sacrificed 24 h after MCAO by an overdose of
sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), and their brains were
cautiously removed and transferred to cold saline (4 °C) for
5 min. Then, seven serial 2-mm-thick sections were cut using
rat brain matrix. The separated sections were stained for
15 min at 37 °C with 2 % of 2,3,5 triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) solution (Sigma, Germany), and then they
were fixed in 10 % buffered paraformaldehyde (Merk,
Germany) for 24 h. When the TTC-stained slices were prepared, they were separately photographed using a digital
camera (Sony, Japan), which was connected to a computer.
By applying an image analyzer software (NIH image analyzer), the infarct areas were measured and analyzed. In order to
calculate the infarct volume of each slice, the area of each one
was multiplied by its thickness (2 mm). Subsequently, the
volume determined for each slice was summed up to achieve
the whole infarct volume per head for each ischemic rat brain
by applying the following equation, the contribution of edema
to the infarct volume was achieved (Swanson et al. 1990):
Corrected infarct volume=left hemisphere size−(right
hemisphere size−measured infarct size).

Brain Water Content Measurement
By sacrificing the rats 24 h after MCAO, using an overdose of
sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), the rats’ brains were carefully removed and placed on the pre-cooled rat brain matrix.
Then, olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and brain stem were removed. The cerebrum part of the removed brains was divided
sagittally into two sections, namely, lesion side and contralateral side. The brains were weighted to obtain wet weight
(WW) and then placed in an oven at 110 °C for 24 h to
determine their dry wet (DW). Brain water content was calculated by using the following formula (Vakili et al. 2005):
(WW−DW)/WW×100.

(n = 7), (2) NaHS 1 mg (n = 7), and (3) NaHS 5 mg
(n = 7). Brain water content measurements were performed 24 h after MCAO in three different groups:
(1) control (n = 7), (2) NaHS 1 mg (n = 7), and (3)
NaHS 5 mg (n = 7). Apoptosis assessments were performed 24 h after MCAO in three different groups: (1)
control (n = 4), (2) NaHS 1 mg (n = 4), and (3) NaHS
5 mg (n = 4). NaHS was dissolved in saline and administered via IP at the beginning of MCAO. It is noteworthy that the control rats received only saline.

TUNEL Assay
To detect DNA fragmentation and cell death in the cortex of
peri infarct area, TUNEL assay was applied (Aboutaleb et al.
2013). According to the protocol, the fixation of the tissues
with paraformaldehyde and deparaffinization of paraffinembedded brain sections (7 μm) were performed. In order to
add the TUNEL reaction mixture, the samples were washed
first with PBS and incubated in H2O2 solution, then were
permeabilized with proteinase K, and were rewashed. The
addition of the reaction matrix to samples was done at 37 °C
for 1 h. After washing the sections with (D/W), they were
incubated with fluorescent antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 30 min, rewashed, and visualized by
avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC) technique and
0.05 % 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as a chromogen.
Apoptotic neurons were diagnosed by existence of different
forms of chromatin condensation or apoptotic bodies.

Statistical Analysis
To compare the differences between the groups, one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was applied. When the
ANOVA showed significant differences, the post hoc multiple
comparison test (Tukey) was applied. The neurological scores
were compared by Kruskal Wallis one-way ANOVA followed
by multiple comparison procedures by Dunn’s method.
Differences were considered significant at P<0.05.

Results
Effect of H2S on Infarct Volume
The total infarct volume, as it was computed in saline-treated
animal brains, was 212 mm3 ±13 mm3. As shown in (Figs.1
and 2), administering H2S at the beginning of ischemia at
doses of 1 mg and 5 mg/kg significantly reduced infract
volumes by 29 % (151±7) and 51 % (104±8), respectively,
in comparison with the control group (P<0.001).
Effects of H2S on Cerebral Edema
Brain water content (BWC) was measured as an index of
cerebral edema in both ischemic (right) and non ischemic
(left) hemispheres of all the groups. In sham-operated rats,
BWC of the right and left hemispheres was (78/1±/10 and 78/
3±/22), respectively. Focal cerebral ischemia induced a significant increase in the BWC of the right hemisphere
(ischemic) in the saline-treated animals (83/4 ± /18,
P<0.001). As shown in Fig. 3, while the BWC of contralateral
hemisphere did not change as it did in the sham group (78/9±/

The MCAO-Induced Apoptosis Is Reduced by H2S
Based on the results, MCAO induces apoptosis in the territory
of ischemia in affected brain cortices. Pretreatment with NaHS
reduced TUNEL positive cells (apoptotic) 24 h after reperfusion (Fig. 4). Also, TUNEL positive cells in the saline-treated
group were 53±3.3 (100 μm2). Intraperitoneal administration
of NaHS (1 and 5 mg) at the beginning of ischemia significantly reduced TUNEL positive cells by 41 % (25±1.7) and
61 % (20±.47), respectively, in comparison with the control
group (P<0.001, Fig. 5).

Discussion
The present study provides novel evidence that application of
NaHS (1 and 5 mg) exerts protective effects against cerebral
damage and brain edema in a transient model of focal stroke in
rats. Possible mechanism of action which NaHS provides such
effects might be by preventing apoptosis.
The present result demonstrated that NaHS effectively
reduced brain infarct size as well as inhibits apoptosis of
cortical neurons in a dose-dependent manner in a transient
model of focal cerebral ischemia.
However, there are some evidences indicating that
ischemia-reperfusion injury results in significant increase in
reactive oxygen species, glutamate cytotoxicity, and brain
inflammatory responses (Chan 2001; White et al. 2000;
Zoppo et al. 2000).

Moreover, secondary neuronal injury exacerbating the
damage caused by the initial insult includes microcirculation
failure, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, oxidative stress,
inflammatory responses, neuronal apoptosis, and calcium
overload (Kuroda and Siesjö 1997).
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced at low levels
during normal physiological condition and scavenged by endogenous antioxidant systems. Enhanced formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species leads to increased neuronal
death by oxidizing proteins, damaged DNA, and augmented

levels of lipid peroxidation products in cellular membranes
(Edwards et al. 2008; Rolo and Palmeira 2006).
In accordance with our investigation, Yao et al. showed that
NaHS can protect myocardial apoptosis in response to
ischemia-reperfusion injury (Yao et al. 2010). Moreover, the
capacity of NaHS in attenuation of oxidative stress could be
accounted as the possible mechanisms of its neuroprotective
ability (Luo et al. 2013).
According to the previous studies, H2S protects primary
cultures of neurons from death in a well-studied model of
oxidative stress caused by glutamate, a process called oxidative glutamate toxicity (Lu et al. 2008). In addition, H2S
protects neurons from secondary neuronal injury by functioning as an anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic
mediator (Kimura and Kimura 2004; Zhang et al. 2009).
Recent study shows that by inhibiting an ROS-mediated
caspase-3 signaling pathway, H2S prevents neuronal apoptosis
(Luo et al. 2013).
During the early stages of inflammation, a strong proinflammatory cytokine known as TNFα is secreted
(Nawashiro et al. 1997a; Buttini et al. 1996). Thirty minutes
after brain ischemia, the mRNA of TNFα upregulates
reaching its peak within 6–12 h (Liu et al. 1994; Buttini

J Mol Neurosci (2014) 54:264–270

et al. 1996). Moreover, it is demonstrated that TNFα injection
in both transient and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion models (MCAO) exacerbates brain injury (Barone et al.
1997). Furthermore, cerebral infarct volume in permanent
mice model of ischemia can be reduced through blocking
interaction of TNFα with its receptor by the addition of excess
TNFα-binding protein (Nawashiro et al. 1997a, b). It is important to note that H2S reduces TNFα and other inflammatory mediators (Leeper et al. 2009; Hu et al. 2007).
The previous studies demonstrated that the peak of brain
edema happens 24 h after ischemia in experimental models
(Slivka et al. 1995). According to this study, our results show
that NaHS treatment 24 h after ischemic damage significantly
attenuates brain edema.
Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in
CNS, can also cause excitotoxicity and neural injury. In other
words, the presence of excess glutamate in the synaptic cleft
contributes to the over-activation of NMDA and AMPA
receptor-mediated neurotoxicity (Oh and Betz 1991).
It is worth to note that H2S counteracts glutamate-mediated
excitotoxicity by inducing astrocytes to intake more glutamate
from the extracellular space and thus increasing glutathione in
neurons (Lu et al. 2008). Moreover, free radicals exert their
deleterious actions during both cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. They can contribute to blood brain barrier disruption
directly and can also trigger molecular pathways related to
the dysfunction of ion transporters in the cell membrane and
those related to increased vascular permeability, formation of
edema, and cell death (Oh and Betz 1991). It is also reported
that ROS production in cortical cells can be reduced by H2S
(Luo et al. 2013). The present results demonstrate that H2S
treatment is able to reduce apoptotic cell death and exerts its
protective effects in the brain against ischemic reperfusion
injury.
In conclusion, the present study showed that NaHS treatment reduces brain injuries and postischemic cerebral edema
in a dose-dependent manner. We speculate on the role of
Hydrogen sulfide in the prevention of neuronal apoptosis.
This research offers a novel insight for future studies on the
cytoprotective effects of H2S on central nervous system degenerative diseases and its treatment approaches to stroke
complications.
