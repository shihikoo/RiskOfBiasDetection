Abstract Oxidative stress is well known to play a pivotal role
in cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury. The nuclear factor
erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) pathway has been considered a potential target for neuroprotection in stroke. 11-Keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA) is a
triterpenoid compound from extracts of Boswellia serrata.
The aim of the present study was to determine whether
KBA, a novel Nrf2 activator, can protect against cerebral
ischemic injury. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
was operated on male Sprague–Dawley rats. KBA (25 mg/kg)
applied 1 h after reperfusion significantly reduced infarct
volumes and apoptotic cells as well as increased neurologic
scores at 48 h after reperfusion. Meanwhile, posttreatment
with KBA significantly decreased malondialdehyde (MDA)
levels, restored the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and
increased the protein Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in brain
tissues. In primary cultured astrocytes, KBA increased the
Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which provided protection against
oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced oxidative
insult. But knockdown of Nrf2 or HO-1 attenuated the protective effect of KBA. In conclusion, these findings provide
evidence that the neuroprotection of KBA against oxidative
stress-induced ischemic injury involves the Nrf2/HO-1
pathway.

Ischemic stroke is a debilitating clinical disorder that affects
millions of people, but effective neuroprotective treatments is
lacking. Brain tissue is particularly susceptible to oxidative
damage. Evidence has accumulated that excessive reactive
oxygen species (ROS) are closely related to cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in stroke [1]. Therefore,
antioxidants have been considered in prevention and treatment

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1430–1439

of stroke. The expression of phase II enzymes is regulated by
nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor
[2]. In particular, Nrf2 binds to antioxidant response element
(ARE) localized in the promoter regions of a battery of antioxidant and detoxifying genes including heme oxygenase 1
(HO-1) [2]. Recently, studies have provided evidence for the
therapeutic potential of targeting the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in
brain injury after ischemic stroke [3, 4]. In our previous
studies, we also have demonstrated an important role of
Nrf2 activation in prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [5, 6].
11-Keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA), a pentacyclic
triterpenoid compound, is one of the most important active
principles within the multicomponent mixture of Boswellia
serrata resin [7]. The plant B. serrata shows antioxidant
activity in the cerebrovascular and digestive system [8, 9].
KBA protects against myocardial I/R injury in rats through
mechanisms related to enhancement of antioxidant capacity
and prevention of inflammatory cascade redox and inflammatory cascades [10]. The neuroprotective property of
pentacyclic triterpenoid has drawn increasing interest during
the past couple of years. By way of example, oleanolic acid
shows protective effects on cerebral ischemic damage and
H2O2-induced injury in vitro [11]. Similarly, ursolic acid, a
naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid, was reported to
promote the neuroprotection after cerebral ischemia in mice
by activating Nrf2 pathway [12].
Considering the beneficial properties of triterpenoids and
the possible role of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, we hypothesized
that KBA would provide neuroprotection against I/R injury
induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) in rats and oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)
in primary cultured astrocytes.

Material and Methods
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Model
All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Fourth Military Medical University and were performed in accordance
with published National Institutes of Health guidelines.
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats from the Experimental
Animal Center of Fourth Military Medical University (Xi’an,
China) (280–300 g) were divided randomly into the following
three groups using a random number table generated by SPSS
16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA): sham-operated group
(sham), vehicle-treated I/R group (vehicle+I/R), and KBAtreated I/R group (KBA+I/R). Under chloral hydrate anesthesia, focal cerebral ischemia was performed using the method
of right MCAO with an intraluminal filament as described
previously [13]. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored

1431

using laser Doppler flowmetry (Perimed AB, PeriFlux System
5000, Stockholm, Sweden) in the ipsilateral cortex (2 mm
posterior and 5 mm lateral to the bregma). Sham-operated rats
were manipulated in the same way, but the MCA was not
occluded. Animals that did not show a CBF reduction of at
least 70 % and animals that died after ischemia induction were
excluded from the groups (4 out of 50 in KBA+I/R group). At
2 h after the induction of ischemia, the filament was slowly
withdrawn. The neck incision was closed and rats were
allowed to recover. After revival from anesthesia, the animals
were put back into cages with the room temperature maintained at 25±2 °C. The animals were allowed to survive for
2 days with free access to food and water.
KBA (reagent grade, purity >95 %, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted
with physiological saline (25 mg/kg) was administered by
intraperitoneal injection. According to the published studies,
25 mg/kg KBA administered to rats (corresponding to about
350 mg B. serrata extract/kg) could reach to physiological
concentrations in the plasma and brain [14, 15]. Vehicle of
2 ml/kg physiological saline (vehicle + I/R group) and
25 mg/kg KBA (KBA+I/R group) were given 1 h after
reperfusion.
Measurement of Neurological Score and Infarct Size
At 48 h after reperfusion, an 18-point scoring system was used
to evaluate the neurologic deficits in rats [16]. The scale was
based on the following six tests: (1) spontaneous activity (0 to
3 points); (2) symmetry in the movement of four limbs (0 to 3
points); (3) forepaw outstretching (0 to 3 points); (4) climbing
(1 to 3 points); (5) body proprioception (1 to 3 points); and (6)
response to vibrissae touch (1 to 3 points). The six individual
test scores were summed up at the end of the evaluation
(minimum score, 3; maximum score, 18).
To calculate infarct volume, brains were removed at 48 h
after MCAO and were cut into 2-mm-thick coronal sections
and subjected to 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
staining. Unstained areas were defined as infarcts and were
measured using image analysis software. The percentage of
the infarct volume was calculated by the following formula:
([total contralateral hemispheric volume]−[total ipsilateral
hemispheric stained volume])/(total contralateral hemispheric
volume)×100 %.
HE and TUNEL Staining
Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining was performed to show
the morphological features of injured neurons in the cerebral
cortex. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed on paraffinembedded sections. Commercially available reagents
(Promega, DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL System) were used
to perform TUNEL analysis. The total number of TUNEL-

1432

positive cells in the ipsilateral hemisphere was counted in five
different fields for each section by light microscopy by an
investigator who was blinded to the studies.

Assessment of Oxidative Stress
The right cerebral cortex tissue was homogenized in 2 ml of
10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). After centrifugation at
12,000g for 20 min, the superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the supernatant was assessed spectrophotometrically
with the corresponding kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Biochemistry
Co., Nanjing, China). The protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. The levels of SOD, GPx, and
MDA were expressed as units per milligram protein, units per
milligram protein, and nanomole per gram protein,
respectively.

Immunofluorescence
The paraffin sections, 5 mm thick, which were drawn 48 h
after reperfusion, were first deparaffinized in xylene,
rehydrated with various grades of ethanol, and pretreated with
10 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C. By incubating the
sections in 10 % bovine serum albumin, nonspecific binding
of immunoglobulins was blocked for 20 min. Then the sections were incubated overnight at room temperature in with
anti-Nrf2 or anti-HO-1 and with anti-glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) antibody to mark astroglial cell. Finally, the
sections were coverslipped. The stained sections were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan).

Western Blot
Tissues in cortex or cells were homogenized in RAPI lysis
buffer (Beyotime, China), centrifuged at 14,000g at 4 °C
for 30 min, and then the supernatants were collected as
total proteins. To prepare the cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins, cells were lysed using a nuclear and cytoplasmic
protein extraction kit (Beyotime, China) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford,
MA, USA) by electrophoresis, and membranes were
blocked with 5 % nonfat milk in 0.1 % Tween 20 in
TBS (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were then
incubated with the antibody for HO-1 (Stressgen), Nrf2
(Abcam), histone H3 (Cell Signaling Technology), and βactin (Cell Signaling Technology).

Primary Culture and In Vitro Model of Ischemia
Primary astrocyte cultures were obtained from neonatal rats as
described previously [17]. Cerebral cortices were harvested
from neonatal Sprague–Dawley rats. To model ischemia-like
conditions in vitro, primary cultured astrocytes were exposed
to transient OGD for 60 min. Then, the astrocytes were
incubated again in the incubator with 95 % air and 5 % CO2
with or without KBA for an additional 24 h. OGD-induced
cell death was quantified using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Sigma).
Intracellular ROS Measurement
The level of oxidative stress was determined by measuring
intracellular ROS generation. The production of cellular ROS
was detected using the 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescence assay. Cells were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fresh medium containing DCFH-DA (10 μM) was added. After incubating at
37 °C for 30 min, the cells were washed with PBS,
trypsinized, and resuspended in PBS. The level of ROS generated was measured using flow cytometry based upon the
fluorescence intensity of DCF at 525 nm after excitation at
485 nm. The ROS production was expressed as a percentage
of the control sample.
Nrf2 and HO-1 siRNA Transfection
Neuronal cells were transiently transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting to Nrf2 or HO-1 by Lipofectamine 2000 TM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Knockdown efficiency of Nrf2 and HO-1was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-Nrf2 and HO-1
antibodies. Cells were transfected with siRNA or with a
nontargeting scramble control siRNA for 48 h, followed by
treatment with KBA for the indicated times. Rat Nrf2-specific
siRNA (5′-ACGCAGGAGAGGGAAGAAUAAAGUU-3′
and 5′-AACUUUAUUCUUCCCUCUCCUGCGU-3′), rat
HO-1-specific siRNA (5′-AUGGCAUAAAUUCCCACU
GCCACGG-3′ and 5′-CCGUGGCAGUGGGAAUUUAU
GCCAU-3′), and a nonspecific siRNA (5′-AUGCACGAUA
UAACCUCACCGUCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGACGGUGAGG
UUAUAUCGUGCAU-3′) were provided by Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cell samples were then collected for
Western blot analysis, MTT assay, and measurement of intracellular ROS levels.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All of the values were presented as mean±standard deviation (SD), except for the

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1430–1439

neurological deficit score, and differences between groups
were compared with one-way ANOVA followed by followed
by Fisher’s post hoc test. Neurological deficit scores were
expressed as the median with range. This data was analyzed
by the Kruskal–Wallis test followed by the Mann–Whitney U
test and Bonferroni post hoc correction. P<0.05 was regarded
statistically significant.

group, the cells were arranged irregularly in ischemic periinfarct of the cerebral cortex. Most of them were shrunken
with a triangulated pycnotic nucleus. In contrast, damage was
substantially reduced in the KBA+I/R group.
To detect DNA fragmentation in situ, we performed
TUNEL staining in brain sections. KBA reduced ischemiainduced DNA damage after 48 h of reperfusion. In the control
group, TUNEL-positive cells were densely distributed in the
ischemic cortex. The percentage of TUNEL-positive cells in
the ischemic cortex was decreased from 55.0±7.2 to 36.5±
4.4 % by KBA treatment (n=6 animals per group; P<0.05).
The KBA-treated group exhibited a smaller amount of
TUNEL-positive cells.

KBA Protects Against Cerebral Ischemic Injury
KBA (25 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally to rats 1 h after
reperfusion to assess the in vivo neuroprotective effect. The
infarct volume of the ipsilateral brain was measured 48 h later
with TTC staining. KBA significantly decreased infarct volumes 48 h after reperfusion (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1b, a
remarkably decreased pale-colored region was observed in the
KBA+IR-treated rats (37.1±5.0 %) compared with rats in the
vehicle+IR group (23.2±2.9 %) (P<0.05; n=6 animals per
group). Neurological dysfunction after MCAO was characterized by impaired motility, grasping reflex, and placing reaction. In agreement with infarct volume measurement, KBA
treatment significantly reduced the neurological deficit score
compared with the vehicle treatment (Fig. 1b) (n=6 animals
per group; P<0.05).
The protective effect of KBA against cerebral ischemic
damage was supported by TUNEL staining and HE staining
on sections from the ischemic cortex at 48 h after ischemia/
reperfusion in rats (Fig. 2). Representative photomicrographs
of HE staining are shown. The cells of cortex in sham rats
showed an orderly arrangement. In addition, the cell outline
was clear as well as the structure was compact. In vehicle+I/R

KBA Attenuated Oxidative Stress
SOD activity in the cortex was decreased in the vehicle group
compared with the sham group, which was restored by KBA
(n=8 animals per group; P<0.05) (Table 1). GPx was decreased after I/R (P<0.05), while KBA could upregulate the
activity of GPx significantly (P<0.05 versus vehicle+I/R)
(Table 1). The MDA level in the cortex, which is an index
of lipid peroxidation, was significantly increased in the vehicle group compared with the sham-operated group. An evident reduction of the MDA level was observed in the KBA+I/
R group compared with the vehicle+I/R group (P<0.05)
(Table 1).
KBA Promoted the Expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in Cortex
To identify whether Nrf2/HO-1 signaling is involved in the
neuroprotective effect of KBA, we analyzed ischemic brain
tissue by Western blot and immunofluorescence staining.
Western blot analysis in cortical tissues at 48 h after MCAO
showed that Nrf2 and HO-1 protein expressions were

further increased in KBA-treated group (Fig. 3a) (n=6 animals per group; P<0.05).
Consistently, immunofluorescence staining also showed
that the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in astrocytes of the
cortex was upregulated by KBA at 48 h after ischemia
(Fig. 3b, c). In the sham group, few cells were stained by
Nrf2 and HO-1. In the vehicle+I/R group, the number of cells
stained by Nrf2 and HO-1 increased in the ischemic cortex.
The number of cells labeled with Nrf2 and HO-1 in the KBA+
I/R group was significantly increased compared with the

vehicle+I/R group, which indicated that the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway may have a critical role in the KBA-mediated neuroprotection against I/R injuries in rats.

the OGD model group, no difference was found in the ROS
level of the groups treated with 10 mM KBA, while in the
groups treated with 30 and 50 mM KBA, ROS level significantly decreased by approximately 32 and 44 %, respectively
(P<0.05). KBA effectively reduced OGD-induced increase of
intracellular ROS level in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 5b).

concentration-dependent manner while cytoplasmic Nrf2
levels were decreased gradually. We also found that the treatment of astrocyte cells with 10, 30, and 50 μM of KBA for
24 h increased HO-1 protein expression in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 4b). The highest induction level of
HO-1 (up to sixfold protein expression) was observed after
50 μM of KBA treatment for 24 h (P<0.05). Therefore, a
50 mM concentration of KBA was used in the following
experiments. However, no significant effect was found in
HO-1 expression after treatment with 50 μM of KBA in cells
transfected with Nrf2 siRNA (P>0.05). Knockdown of Nrf2
abolished HO-1 induction by KBA treatment (Fig. 4c).

The Protection of KBA Involves the Nrf2/HO-1 Pathway
To confirm the role of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in KBA-mediated
neuroprotection, we transfected control (si-control), HO-1specific (si-HO-1), or Nrf2-specific (si-Nrf2) siRNA in primary cultured astrocytes for 48 h. Knockdown of Nrf2 or HO1 inhibited cell viability that was increased by KBA under
OGD (Fig. 5c). In consistent, knockdown of Nrf2 or HO-1
increased ROS level by 25 and 19 % compared with the sicontrol group, respectively (Fig. 5d). Taken together, KBA
effectively prevented astrocytes from oxidative damage involved activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.

Discussion
KBA Protects Astrocytes Against Injury Induced by OGD
OGD treatment resulted in 58 % cell death (P<0.05). KBA
significantly blocked OGD-induced cell death dose dependently (P<0.05; Fig. 5a). Compared to the OGD group, the
viability of the cells treated with 50 μM KBA was increased
by approximately 30 % (P<0.05). As shown in Fig. 5, ROS
production of OGD model group markedly increased (up to

There is a considerable current interest in the neuroprotective
effects of natural antioxidants against oxidative stress and the
different defense mechanisms involved, such as sulforaphane
[18] and resveratrol [19], can activate Nrf2 and increase
expression of antioxidative genes. Due to its antioxidant properties, KBA has potential implications in treating oxidative
injuries [9]; however, the mechanism of KBA protection was

poorly understood. Our study shows for the first time that
KBA has protective effects against cerebral I/R injury in an
MCAO model demonstrated by improved neurologic scores,
reduced infarct volume, and ameliorated neuronal apoptosis.
The mechanism is possibly attributed to activating Nrf2/HO-1
pathway. More recently, triterpenoids structurally similar to
KBA, such as maslinic acid and oleanolic acid, have been
reported to significantly increase Nrf2, leading to neuroprotection [20, 11]. In another approach, stimulating Nrf2 by
triterpenoid could effectively reduce 1-methyl-4-phenyl1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced oxidative stress
in the mouse model while Nrf2 knockout mice failed to block
against MPTP neurotoxicity, implying a direct protective role
of Nrf2/ARE against MPTP neurotoxicity [21]. These data are
noteworthy and suggest that specific triterpenoid compounds
could be beneficial for the treatment of ischemic stroke related
to oxidative stress.

Nrf2 is a master regulator of the antioxidative defense
responses. Our in vivo and in vitro studies found that KBA
regulates Nrf2, thereby enhancing the protective defense
mechanisms through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. KBA markedly
increased the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the ischemic
cortex at 48 h after MCAO as well as in primary culture
astrocytes. Consistent with this, the double immunofluorescent studies revealed that in the cortex, the HO-1 was clearly
upregulated. On the other hand, consistent to our findings in
this study, Nrf2 and HO-1 induction had been reported previously in the rat brain following transient focal ischemia [22,
23]. In primary astrocyte cells, we found that KBA caused
Nrf2 nuclear translocation in a concentration-dependent manner. Activation and nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 upregulates
endogenous antioxidant defenses to restore cellular redox
homeostasis via the induction of phase II defense enzymes
and antioxidant stress proteins [24, 25]. Existing data has

demonstrated that Nrf2-deficient mice are more susceptible to
oxidative stress [26]. Another study on wild-type and Nrf2
knockout mice also showed that Nrf2 reduces ischemic brain
injury by protecting against oxidative stress [27]. The HO-1
promoter is known to have a large number of ARE sequences
to which Nrf2 can bind to induce its expression in a preferential manner [28]. As shown in our in vitro study, the si-Nrf2
treatment significantly decreased the level of Nrf2 in nuclear
extracts from cells treated with KBA and reduced the upregulation of its target gene HO-1.
Noteworthy, the expression of HO-1 is mediated by several
signaling pathways and transcription factors, including Nrf2,
AP-1, and NF-kB as the most prominent [29]. Among them,
redox-dependent Keap1/Nrf2 system plays a central role for
HO-1 induction in response to oxidative stress [30]. HO-1 has
been reported to protect tissues by restoring redox homeostasis and reducing inflammation due to its antioxidant,
antiapoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. HO-1 is more
likely to exert a central role in neuroprotection because it is
inducible to degrade free heme, and its metabolites, CO or
biliverdin/bilirubin, can directly provide cytoprotection [31,
32]. HO-1 has been implicated to be particularly important in
neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia, as evidenced by
HO-1 knockout mice exhibiting greater ischemic damage as
compared to wild-type mice [33].
With KBA treatment in MCAO, enhanced activities of
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase

(GPx) and a decreased level of MDA were observed. SOD
dismutates superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, and
GPx eliminates hydrogen peroxide, which is potentially converted to other radicals [34]. MDA is not only produced by
oxidative stress-induced peroxidation but also by enzymatically produced lipid peroxidation during the arachidonic acid
cascade which is an important element of postischemic secondary injury [34]. The reduced activities of SOD and GPx
and enhanced MDA level in the vehicle group imply that
severe oxidative stress occurred during permanent MCAO
that increased free radical activity and reciprocally reduced
endogenous antioxidants occurring during cerebral ischemia.
Our results are consistent with previous work [9, 35]. We
propose that an in vivo therapeutic effect of KBA is related
to an antioxidant effect by enhancing Nrf2 regulation and,
therefore, alleviates oxidative stress during ischemic stroke.
Activation of Nrf2 in astrocytes protects neurons from a
wide array of potentially toxic insults. Nrf2 activation in
astrocytes has thus been proposed as a novel therapeutic target
for neuroprotection [36]. Astrocytes, the major glial
nonneuronal cells, play an important role in the cellular antioxidant defense in the brain. They are the main source of
glutathione (GSH) and supply the neurons with substrate for
GSH synthesis to improve the neuronal antioxidative reserves
[37]. ARE-regulated genes are preferentially activated in astrocytes, which consequently have more efficient detoxification and antioxidant defense than neurons.

According to the MTT assay and ROS measurement
in vitro, pretreatment with KBA before OGD damage can
significantly reduce cell death. We speculate that the protective effect was due to the antioxidant properties of KBA. In
cell viability assays, KBA reduced astrocytes death triggered
by OGD. The fact that KBA could inhibit the increase in ROS
also shows that KBA may have the ability to rescue cells from
OGD. These in vitro data support our in vivo results and show
that KBA promotes an antioxidative effect.
The present study also demonstrated that knockdown of
Nrf2 or HO-1 in primary cultured astrocytes that were subjected to OGD partly diminished KBA’s neuroprotective effect. These observations strongly suggest that Nrf2/HO-1 is
required for KBA-dependent cytoprotection against oxidative
stress, although other enzymes can also assist with KBA
neuroprotection. Although the mechanisms leading to nuclear
translocation of Nrf2 are poorly defined, we believe that Nrf2
and HO-1 induced by KBA decreased ROS in astrocytes and
that it is responsible, at least in part, for the protective effects
against OGD.
This study focused on the protective effect of KBA against
oxidative stress-induced ischemic injury and did not explore
in detail whether other signaling pathways contribute to the
effects of KBA. Moreover, because we only performed mechanism research in astrocytes involved in the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, we should consider the neurons or other cell types may
also involve in this process as a previous study concluded
[38]. Another limitation was that, in this study, just merely a
single dose of KBA was used in animal experiments. In
myocardial I/R injury rats, KBA exerted a dose-dependent
cardioprotective effect through mechanisms related to enhancement of antioxidant capacity [39]. Therapeutic time
window and the dose–response relationship of KBA injection
against cerebral I/R injury in rat should be determined.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration
of the therapeutic potential of KBA on permanent MCAO in
rats. We revealed that posttreatment with KBA 1 h after
reperfusion could attenuate ischemic injury in an MCAO
model. Furthermore, in vivo studies showed that AKBA protects astrocytes against OGD-induced cell death activating the
Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. However, knockdown of HO-1 or Nrf2
partly blocked the protective effect of AKBA. Therefore, our
study provides evidence about the therapeutic potential of
targeting the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway with KBA to prevent brain
injury after ischemic stroke.
