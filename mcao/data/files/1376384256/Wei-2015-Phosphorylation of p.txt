Abstract Aquaporin 9 (AQP9), an aquaglyceroporin, is
an important aquaporin in the brain. This study examined
the expression patterns of AQP9 and p38 mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK) in ischaemic brains from rats with
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) to
elucidate the function and regulation of AQP9 after ischaemia. AQP9 was co-localised with glial fibrillary acidic
protein-positive astrocytes and neuronal nuclei-positive
neurons in rat brains. Expression of AQP9 increased continuously until 24 h after pMCAO in the ischaemic core
region and the border region. Importantly, this increase in
expression of AQP9 correlated with brain oedema. AQP9
expression was predominant in astrocytes within 3 h after
pMCAO and then in neurons 6 h after pMCAO. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK was also induced in the ischaemic
core region and the border region at different time points
after pMCAO. Interestingly, intracerebroventricular injection of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 attenuated
AQP9 expression after pMCAO. Taken together, these
results indicate that dynamic changes in AQP9 expression,
mediated in part via the p38 MAPK signal transduction
pathway, may contribute to the development of cerebral
oedema after brain ischaemia.

Introduction
Aquaporins (AQPs) mediate rapid diffusion of water
through cell membranes (Preston et al. 1992). The AQP
family in mammals is divided into aquaporins, aquaglyceroporins and super-aquaporins on the basis of sequence
homology and permeability properties (Gonen and Walz
2006). Among them, AQP9 is a member of the aquaglyceroporin subfamily.
Although AQP9 mRNA have been detected and described in astrocytes, endothelial cells and neurons since
1998 (Badaut et al. 2001, 2004; Badaut and Regli 2004;
Elkjaer et al. 2000; Nicchia et al. 2001; Yamamoto et al.
2002), its presence in the rat brain remains controversial to
date. Recent studies have used in situ hybridization to
prove the existence of AQP9 mRNA and antibody staining
to show AQP9 immunoreactivity in brain cells (Mylonakou
et al. 2009). Our previous study also showed the presence
of both AQP9 mRNA transcripts and proteins in the rat
brain by in situ hybridization and immunostaining, respectively (Yang et al. 2009a).
AQP9 is highly permeable not only to water, but also to
various solutes, including urea, glycerol, monocarboxylate
(lactate and b-hydroxybutyrate) and other small molecules.
During stroke, blood flow obstruction decreases oxygen
supply into cells. As a result, glucose cannot be completely
oxidised and used as fuel for neurons. To compensate for
this, lactate and glycerol, which are important energy
substrates, diffuse through AQP9 in astrocytes and neurons. Therefore, elucidating the variation and possible
regulation of AQP9 after stroke is important. To date,

123

expression of AQP9 after stroke has been studied in the
context of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO), and its variation has been investigated in astrocytes (Badaut et al. 2001). However, little is known
about the variation of AQP9 in neurons. Here, we hypothesized that AQP9 also plays a role in the pathogenesis
of brain edema and in neuron survival in response to
pMCAO.
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), a
member of the MAPK superfamily, is activated in response
to external stimuli. Previous studies have reported that p38
MAPK regulates AQP9 expression in astrocytes under
hyperosmotic conditions (Arima et al. 2003; Yang et al.
2013). However, the role of p38 MAPK in regulating
AQP9 expression under ischaemia is not clear. Here, we
sought to investigate AQP9 expression in the rat brain after
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and
to elucidate the role of p38 MAPK in regulating AQP9
expression.

MCA. For Real-time PCR and Western blot, tissues were
sampled from the core of the ischaemia including the
striatal core and the overlying neocortex (the ‘‘central part
of the ischaemic cortex’’). Samples were also collected
from the neocortical border region (the neocortical border
zone, defined as the most peripheral zone of the affected
cortex and with distinct paler appearance than the core) as
previously described (Frydenlund et al. 2006). Samples
from the contralateral side were also collected as internal
reference.
Brain water content

Materials and methods

Brain water content (BWC) was measured by the wet-dry
weighing ratio method. After the animals were anesthetized, their brains were removed and divided into ischaemic and contralateral hemispheres. The brain samples
were weighed immediately after dissection (wet weight)
and then dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 48 h. The
dried brain was then re-weighted. The percent of water
content was calculated as ð½wet weight  dry weight=
wet weightÞ  100%:

Animals

Measurement of infarct volume

Male adult Sprague–Dawley rats (12 weeks old, weighing
250–280 g) were obtained from the Animal Breeding Facility, Chongqing Medical University. All procedures were
performed in accordance with the recommendations of the
National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23). Rats
were randomly divided into two groups, the ischaemic
group (n = 115) and the sham group (n = 75). Rats were
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg).

Animals were killed at different time points after pMCAO
and brains were rapidly removed and frozen at -20 °C for
5 min. The brains were sliced into 2 mm thick coronal
sections and immersed in 2 % 2,3,5-tripenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) at 37 °C for 20 min. TTC, a colourless salt,
is converted to a red formazan product in the presence of a
functioning mitochondrial electron transport chain. Thus,
normal brain tissue is dyed bright red, whereas the infarct
region appears white.
Drug treatment

Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
pMCAO was induced in male rats as previously described
(Li et al. 2007). Briefly, a nylon monofilament (4–0) was
surgically inserted and advanced through the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery. This resulted in
occlusion of the ostium of the ipsilateral middle cerebral
artery (MCA). The length of the filament inserted into the
vessel was adjusted according to body weight and varied
from 18 to 20 mm. Rectal temperature was controlled and
maintained at 36.5 °C with a temperature unit and a heating pad during the anesthesia period with a heated fixed
temperature operating table (Harvard Apparatus, USA).
Rats were sacrificed at 1, 3, 6, 12, or 24 h after MCAO (35
rats for 6 h, 20 rats for the other time point). The operation
procedure for the sham group was the same as that for the
ischaemic group but without occlusion of the unilateral

123

Prior to pMCAO, the rats received an intracerebroventricular injection of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580
(1 mM) or dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1 %) in the ischaemic
side. Drug administration was performed as previously
described (Zhang et al. 2008). The location of each injection was 0.8 mm posterior to the Bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to
the midline and 4.5 mm below the skull surface. The rats
underwent pMCAO as previously described.
Reverse transcription real time PCR
Total RNA from tissue specimens was isolated using the
Tissue/cell RNA Mini kit at different time points after
pMCAO. The cDNAs were generated from 1 lg of total
RNA using superscript II RNase H- reverse transcriptase
along with Oligo (dT) primers. Quantification of AQP9

mRNA levels was done by real-time PCR using Taqman
probes. The primers used in this study are listed in Table 1.
All primer pairs were designed using the rat AQP9 mRNA
sequences retrieved from GenBank. The beta-actin primer
sets were used as house-keeping control genes.
Reactions were carried out in 20 ll volumes consisting
of Premix Ex Taq (29) 10 ll, PCR Forward Primer
(10 lm) 0.4 ll, PCR Reverse Primer (10 lm) 0.4 ll,
Taqman probe (20 lm) 0.8 ll, Rox reference Dye (509)
0.4 ll, cDNA 2 ll and ddH2O 6 ll (TaKaRa, China). Each
run consisted of serial dilution (109) of standard preparation and rat cDNA samples to generate a standard curve.
In each reaction, 2 ll cDNA was amplified. The amplification program was as follows: preincubation at 95 °C for
10 s (s), fast start polymerase action at 95 °C for 5 s, followed by 60 °C for 31 s. Taqman probe fluorescence was
measured at 60 °C in each amplification cycle. Changes in
AQP9 mRNA expression were examined with the
ABI7000 Sequence Detection System (Perkin Elmer,
USA). A standard curve was used to extrapolate the copy
number of target cDNAs in the rat brain.
Tissue fixation and immunofluorescence
Anesthetized rats were perfused transcardially with 4 %
paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Then, brains were removed and immersed in a fixative solution overnight. Brains were further stored in PBS containing 30 % sucrose for 48 h at 4 °C for cryoprotection as
previously described (Wang et al. 2014). Brains were then
sliced (10 lm thickness). Sections were blocked with 10 %
goat serum and incubated with an antibody against AQP9
(1:400, rabbit anti-AQP9, Alpha Diagnostic International,
USA) and with an antibody against glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) (astrocyte marker, 1:500, mouse anti-GFAP,
Santa Cruz, USA) or neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (neuronal
marker, 1:500, mouse anti-NeuN, Santa Cruz, USA). Immunofluorescence was revealed using FITC-labeled fragments of goat anti-rabbit IgG plus Cy5-labeled fragments of
goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, USA). Tissue sections
were mounted in 50 % glycerol dissolved in PBS. Samples
were observed under a confocal microscope equipped with
argon and helio/neon lasers (Leica TCS SP2, Wetzlar,

Germany). Controls were performed by omitting either one
or both primary antibodies. All controls gave negative results
with no detectable labeling.
Western blot analysis
Tissue specimens were homogenized at 4 °C in a homogenization buffer containing 50 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 2 lg/ml leupeptin, 2 lg/ml pepstatin
A, 2 mM phenylmethysufonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 200
KIE/ml aprotinin. The homogenates were then centrifuged at
10,0009g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected
and protein concentration was determined by a Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Samples were
separated by 12 % SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred onto
PVDF membranes. Blotted membranes were blocked with
5 % skim milk and then incubated with primary antibodies
against AQP9 (1:500, rabbit anti-AQP; Alpha Diagnostic International, USA), or antibodies against p38 (1:500, goat antip38; Santa Cruz, USA), or antibodies against phosphorylated
p38 (1:1000, goat anti-p-p38; Santa Cruz, USA). Thereafter,
they were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz, USA). Western blot
bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate
(Pierce, USA). Quantification was done by gel densitometry
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). The value of the AQP9 protein
band was divided by the value for beta-actin for the same
sample (AQP9/beta-actin). In addition, p-p38/p38 values were
also calculated. Each data point was repeated in triplicate.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 11.0
software package (Chicago, IL, USA). Correlations were
compared using analysis of bivariance. The levels of AQP9
protein and mRNA expression as well as levels of p38
expression and p38 phosphorylation were expressed as
mean ± SD. Differences between individual groups were
first compared using analysis of variance (one-way
ANOVA); thereafter, data were analyzed post hoc with
LSD multiple comparisons test. All reported p values were
two-sided, and a value of p \ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Brain oedema increased in the ischaemic side
within 24 h after pMCAO
We measured brain water content (BWC) to detect brain
oedema induced by pMCAO. Compared to the sham group,
BWC of the ischaemic side increased with occlusion time
extension after pMCAO (Fig. 1).
Morphological examination of infarction
after pMCAO
We used TTC staining to evaluate infarct volume after
pMCAO. Brain slices of the ischaemic hemisphere were
divided into the ischaemic core region and the border region based on TTC staining (Fig. 2). With extension of
occlusion time, the infarct region increased in size.
Temporal changes in AQP9 mRNA expression in rat
brains after pMCAO
The mRNA expression level of AQP9 after pMCAO was
evaluated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). Compared to brain tissues from
the sham group, AQP9 mRNA level was higher in the
ischaemic core zone as well as the border zone (Fig. 3).
AQP9 mRNA levels increased with extension of occlusion
time and reached the highest level both in the ischaemic
core and the border zone 24 h after pMCAO.
In addition, we found significant positive correlation
between the level of AQP9 mRNA and BWC both in the
ischemic core (r = 0.654, n = 5, p \ 0.05) and the border
region (r = 0.710, n = 5, p \ 0.05).

Temporal changes in AQP9 protein expression
in the sham and pMCAO rat brains
The results of double-labelling immunofluorescence
showed that AQP9 labelling was co-localised with glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte marker, and
neuronal nuclei (NeuN), a neuronal marker. AQP9 labelling was higher in the neurons and astrocytes of the
ischaemic hemisphere. AQP9 expression was predominant
in astrocytes within 3 h after pMCAO and in neurons 6 h
after pMCAO (Fig. 4).
The protein level of AQP9 in brain specimens after
pMCAO was quantitatively analysed by Western blot. No
significant difference in AQP9 protein expression was detected between the non-ischemic side and the sham group
after pMCAO. AQP9 protein expression was stronger in
ischaemic brain tissues than in sham brain tissues. A
positive correlation between the level of AQP9 protein and
BWC was observed in both the ischemic core region
(r = 0.732, n = 5, p \ 0.05) and the border region
(r = 0.826, n = 5, p \ 0.05). AQP9 expression significantly increased with extension of occlusion time both
in the border zone and the ischaemic core after pMCAO
(Fig. 5).
p38 MAPK protein expression in rat brains
after pMCAO
p38 MAPK protein expression in brain specimens was
measured by Western blot. Compared with the sham group,
the ratios of p38 and phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) were
higher in the ischaemic core and the border zone on the
ischaemic side (Fig. 5).
Effect of a p38 MAPK inhibitor on AQP9 expression
after pMCAO
The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 was injected before
inducing ischaemia to determine whether the p38 pathway
is involved in inducing AQP9 expression after pMCAO.
The effect of SB203580 was determined at 6 h after
pMCAO to investigate the molecular changes caused by
the inhibitor at an early stage. Results showed that
SB203580 treatment decreased both p38 phosphorylation
and the expression level of AQP9 after pMCAO (Fig. 6).

Thus far, six AQPs (AQP1, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9) have been
reported to be expressed in the central nervous system
(CNS). Among them, AQP1 is found in the cell plasma
membrane of choroid plexus epithelial cells (Papadopoulos

and Verkman 2013; Speake et al. 2003). AQP4, the predominant AQP in the brain, serves several regulatory
functions within the CNS during oedema (Papadopoulos
and Verkman 2005, 2007), and neuroexcitation (Binder
et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2004). We recently analysed the
variation in AQP4 expression after stroke (Yang et al.
2009b), and found evidence suggesting that it could be
involved in brain oedema, which is consistent with a previous study (Frydenlund et al. 2006; Taniguchi et al. 2000).
We also investigated the expression pattern and possible
roles of AQP3, 5, and 8 after stroke in the same study. In

the present study, we found that expression of AQP9 in
ischaemic rat brains correlated with brain oedema, indicating that AQP9 may be involved in brain oedema.
AQP9 labelling has previously been reported in astrocytes in the periventricular parenchyma and glia limitans,
in endothelial cells at the border of the subarachnoid space,
and in neurons, particularly catecholaminergic neurons (Li
et al. 2005; Wiegman et al. 2008). The current study
showed that AQP9 was expressed in astrocytes and neurons
after pMCAO. AQP9 labelling was observed in the
ependyma, subpial processes of astrocytes, suprachiasmatic

nucleus, dorsal thalamus, supraoptic nucleus, hippocampus
and white matter. This regional distribution of AQP9 is
similar to that of AQP4 (Yang et al. 2011), indicating that
AQP9 may be involved in the control of plasma osmolality
by the CNS and extracellular water homeostasis. The discrepancy in AQP9 labelling between the present and previous studies may be related to differences in animal
species (rat vs. mice) and cell markers (NeuN vs. TH).
AQP9 expression is present not only around microvessels, such as AQP4, but also on astrocytic processes,
indicating that AQP9 may be involved in intense water
transport. Results of the current study showed that pMCAO
upregulated AQP9 expression in ischaemic brains and that
this expression correlated with ischaemic hemisphere
oedema. A similar variation in AQP4 after pMCAO was
observed in our previous study (Yang et al. 2009b), indicating that AQP9 is another water channel that contributes
to and participates in oedema formation after pMCAO.
The expression profiles of AQP9 were similar to that of
AQP4 after pMCAO (Yang et al. 2009b). However, AQP4

was only expressed in astrocytes, whereas AQP9 was expressed in both astrocytes and neurons. This result indicated that AQP9 might also have other functions. In our
previous study, we reported that expression levels of
AQP3, 5, and 8 were significantly increased, peaking at 6 h
after pMCAO, after which they decreased gradually but
remained higher than those in the sham group. Although
AQP9, 3, 5, and 8 were all observed in both astrocytes and
neurons, the expression level of AQP9 significantly differed from those of AQP3, AQP5 and AQP8 12 h after
pMCAO. This difference can be attributed to the wider
distribution of AQP9 than that of AQP3, 5, and 8. In addition, AQP9 is permeable to lactate. The permeability of
AQP9 to lactate increased by fourfold when pH decreased
to 5.5 (Tsukaguchi et al. 1998). Other studies reported that
lactate is an important energy substrate for neurons and a
product of glycolysis under hypoxic conditions (Phillis
et al. 2001). Lactate production increased with increase in
the duration of ischemia. Lactic acidosis during ischaemia
may upregulate AQP9, which allows the excess lactate

p38 MAPK has been implicated in a wide variety of
biological processes. In the present study, a significant
increase in p-p38 MAPK level was found in ischaemic rats
compared to sham rats at various time points after
pMCAO. Injection of the p38 inhibitor down-regulated
p-p38 and AQP9 expression, indicating that upregulation

of AQP9 expression after pMCAO was mediated via the
p38 pathway.
In conclusion, the results of the present study showed
that AQP9 expression correlated strongly with brain
oedema, suggesting that AQP9 contributes to oedema
formation after pMCAO. Upregulation of AQP9 expression after pMCAO in both astrocytes and neurons suggested that AQP9 may be involved in mediating lactate
shuttle between these two cell types. In addition, evidence
was found for AQP9 expression via the p38 pathway after
pMCAO.
