Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) is the primary acid sensor in mammalian brain and plays a major
role in neuronal injury following cerebral ischemia. Evidence that inhibition of ASIC1a might be neuroprotective following stroke was previously obtained using “PcTx1 venom” from the tarantula Psalmopeous cambridgei. We show here that the ASIC1a-selective blocker PcTx1 is present at only 0.4%
abundance in this venom, leading to uncertainty as to whether the observed neuroprotective effects
were due to PcTx1 blockade of ASIC1a or inhibition of other ion channels and receptors by the hundreds
of peptides and small molecules present in the venom. We therefore examined whether pure PcTx1 is
neuroprotective in a conscious model of stroke via direct inhibition of ASIC1a. A focal reperfusion model
of stroke was induced in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) by administering endothelin-1
to the middle cerebral artery via a surgically implanted cannula. Two hours later, SHR were treated with
a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) dose of PcTx1 (1 ng/kg), an ASIC1a-inactive mutant of PcTx1 (1 ng/
kg), or saline, and ledged beam and neurological tests were used to assess the severity of symptomatic
changes. PcTx1 markedly reduced cortical and striatal infarct volumes measured 72 h post-stroke, which
correlated with improvements in neurological score, motor function and preservation of neuronal architecture. In contrast, the inactive PcTx1 analogue had no effect on stroke outcome. This is the ﬁrst
demonstration that selective pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a is neuroprotective in conscious SHRs,
thus validating inhibition of ASIC1a as a potential treatment for stroke.

1. Introduction
The severe oxygen depletion that occurs during ischemic stroke
compels the brain to switch from oxidative phosphorylation to
anaerobic glycolysis, which in turn leads to acidosis via increased
lactate levels. The extracellular pH can fall from ~7.3 to 6.0e6.5 in
the ischemic core under normoglycemic conditions, and it can drop
to below 6.0 during severe ischemia (Isaev et al., 2008; O'Bryant
et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2004). In vivo studies show that acidosis
aggravates ischemic brain injury (Xiong et al., 2004) and a direct
correlation between brain acidosis and infarct size has been

demonstrated (Xiong et al., 2007). The pH reached during cerebral
acidosis can activate acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and this
activation has been suggested to play a critical role in strokeinduced neuronal injury (O'Bryant et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2007).
ASICs were discovered in the late 1990s, almost 20 years after
the observation that sensory neurons depolarise in response to a
sudden drop in pH (Krishtal, 2003). Although they belong to the
epithelial sodium channel/degenerin family of receptors, they are
distinguished by their restriction to chordates, predominantly
neuronal distribution, and activation by decreases in extracellular
pH (Gründer and Chen, 2010). Alternative splicing of four ASICencoding genes leads to the expression of six subunits (ASIC1a,
ASIC1b, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3, and ASIC4) that combine to form
hetero- or homo-trimeric channels that differ in their pH sensitivity
and tissue distribution (Wemmie et al., 2006).
Postsynaptic ASIC1a channels are the dominant ASIC subtype in
both human and rodent brain (Hoagland et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010).
The pH for half-maximal activation (pH0.5) of ASIC1a is 6.6 in

C.A. McCarthy et al. / Neuropharmacology 99 (2015) 650e657

human cortical neurons (Li et al., 2010) and 6.4 in rat Purkinje
neurons (Allen and Attwell, 2002) and consequently they are
robustly activated by the decrease in extracellular pH that occurs
during cerebral ischemia. Importantly, homomeric ASIC1a channels
can mediate the uptake of Ca2þ in addition to Naþ and protons
(Gründer and Chen, 2010). Thus, brain ASIC1a can contribute to the
intracellular Ca2þ overload during stroke and may be at least partly
responsible for the precipitous drop in intracellular pH from ~7 to
as low as 6.15 during cerebral ischemia (Isaev et al., 2008).
The most potent and selective blocker of ASIC1a described to
date is PcTx1, a 40-residue peptide isolated from the venom of the
Trinidad Chevron tarantula, Psalmopeous cambridgei (Escoubas
et al., 2000). PcTx1 blocks rat ASIC1a (rASIC1a) with an IC50 of
~0.5 nM and ASIC1a/2b heteromers with an IC50 of ~3 nM, but it
does not inhibit other ASIC homomers or heteromers. Several
previous studies have claimed that PcTx1 is highly neuroprotective
in rodent models of ischemic stroke (Pignataro et al., 2007; Xiong
et al., 2004). For example, in a rat model of transient focal
ischemia (middle cerebral artery occlusion; MCAO), i.c.v. injection
of ‘PcTx1 venom’ 30 min before and after induction of ischemia
reduced infarct size by 60% (Xiong et al., 2004). Consistent with this
being an effect mediated by ASIC1a, infarct size was similarly
smaller by 61% in ASIC1/ mice as compared to wild-type mice
(Xiong et al., 2004). These observations have improved our understanding of stroke pathophysiology and highlighted ASIC1a as a
therapeutic candidate for the development of neuroprotective
agents for treatment of stroke.
Surprisingly, the aforementioned studies did not use pure PcTx1
but rather the whole venom from the spider P. cambridgei, which
contains PcTx1. Spider venoms are extremely complex chemical
cocktails, containing hundreds to thousands of unique peptides
(Escoubas et al., 2006). The venom of P. cambridgei is no exception
and it is known to contain modulators of TRPV1 and voltage-gated
ion channels (Siemens et al., 2006) in addition to PcTx1. This raises
the question as to whether the reported neuroprotective effect of
‘PcTx1 venom’ was due to block of ASIC1a by PcTx1 or unrelated
pharmacological effects mediated by other venom components.
Therefore, to address this question, we examined the neuroprotective efﬁcacy of pure, recombinant PcTx1 in a conscious hypertensive rat model of transient MCAO. We show that a single
dose of PcTx1 delivered 2 h after stroke dramatically reduces infarct
size and restores normal levels of neurological and motor function.
These effects are due speciﬁcally to inhibition of ASIC1a, as no
neuroprotection was observed with a “disarmed” PcTx1 mutant
peptide that can no longer inhibit the channel.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. HPLC analysis of P. cambridgei venom
Reversed-phase (RP) HPLC analysis of crude P. cambridgei venom
was performed using a Shimadzu Prominence system. One mg of
venom was fractionated on a Zorbax SB300 reversed-phase C18
column (4.6  250 mm, 5 mm, 300 Å) using a ﬂow rate of 0.8 ml/min
and the following gradient of solvent B (0.043% triﬂuoroacetic acid
(TFA)in 90% acetonitrile) in solvent A (0.043% TFA in water): 10%
solvent B for 2.5 min, 10e45% solvent B over 50 min, 45e70% solvent B over 5 min. The early eluting fraction was further analysed
on a Thermo HyPurity C18 column (4.6  100 mm, 5 mm, 120 Å)
using a gradient of 0% solvent B for 5 min then 0e15% solvent B over
15 min at a ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min.
2.2. Peptide production
Recombinant PcTx1 and a double mutant analogue were

651

produced using an E. coli periplasmic expression system described
previously (Klint et al., 2013). Brieﬂy, synthetic genes encoding
wild-type or mutant PcTx1, preceded by a TEV protease cleavage
site, were produced by GeneArt (Regensburg, Germany) and
subcloned into a variant of the pLicC-His6-MBP periplasmic
expression vector which enables periplasmic expression of target
peptides as fusions to maltose binding protein (MBP). The His6MBP-PcTx1 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain
BL21(lDE3) and isolated from cell lysates by passage over Ni-NTA
Superﬂow resin (QIAGEN). The His6-MBP tag was then removed
from the eluted fusion protein by cleavage with TEV protease. Recombinant PcTx1 (with an N-terminal serine added to facilitate TEV
cleavage) was isolated to >95% purity using a ﬁnal RP-HPLC step.
We previously demonstrated that this recombinant peptide is
equipotent with native PcTx1a (Saez et al., 2011).
2.3. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
Peptide masses were conﬁrmed by matrix assisted laser
desorption ionisationetime of ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDITOF MS) using a Model 4700 Proteomics Bioanalyser (Applied
Biosystems, CA, USA). Peptide samples were mixed (1:1, v:v) with
a-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid matrix (5 mg/ml in 50/50
acetonitrile/H2O) and MALDI-TOF spectra were collected in positive
reﬂector mode. All masses given are for the monoisotopic MþHþ
ions.
2.4. Electrophysiology
Two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) was carried out using
Xenopus oocytes as previously described (Schroeder et al., 2014).
cRNA encoding rat ASIC1a (rASIC1a) was synthesized using an
mMessage mMachine cRNA transcription kit and healthy stage V-VI
oocytes injected with 4 ng rASIC1a cRNA (40 nL of 100 ng/uL). All
experiments were performed at room temperature (18e21  C) in
ND96 solution containing 0.1% fatty acid free-bovine serum albumin (BSA). Changes in extracellular pH were induced using a
microperfusion system that allowed local, rapid exchange of solutions. HEPES was replaced by MES to buffer the pH 6 stimulus solution. Peptides were dissolved in ND96 solution (pH7.45)
containing 0.1% BSA to prevent adsorption onto tubing.
2.5. Cannulae implantation
Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (~20 weeks of age;
300e350 g) were anaesthetised with ketamine (75 mg/kg; Sigma)/
xylazine (10 mg/kg; Troy; i.p). A 23-gauge stainless steel guide
cannula was stereotaxically implanted to sit 3 mm dorsal to the
right middle cerebral artery in the piriform cortex. An additional
cannula was implanted into the left lateral ventricle (0.8 mm
anterior, þ1.5 mm lateral, and 3.2 mm ventral relative to Bregma)
which was left exposed to allow a bolus dose of drug to be
administered 2 h after stroke. The animals were housed individually and were allowed a 5-day recovery period prior to the induction of stroke. All animal care and procedures were approved by the
Monash University Animal Ethics Committee. The minimum
number of animals were used and, where possible, an in vitro
approach was applied.
2.6. Drug treatments
SHR (~20 weeks of age; 300e350 g) were randomly allocated to
one of several treatment groups so the experimenter was blind to
all treatments. Out of the thirty animals stroked in this study, one
animal was excluded because it did not reach the appropriate level

652

C.A. McCarthy et al. / Neuropharmacology 99 (2015) 650e657

of stroke. In addition, three animals were excluded because they
had a stroke that was greater than a grade-4 stroke. All excluded
animals were humanely sacriﬁced immediately after the ﬁnal injection of endothein-1 (ET-1). The remaining animals received
either PcTx1 (1 ng/kg; n ¼ 9), inactive mutant PcTx1 (1 ng/kg;
n ¼ 7), or vehicle (saline) (n ¼ 10). All drugs were administered by
intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection 2 h after stroke via a previously implanted guide cannula using a 30-gauge injector protruding 3 mm into the lateral ventricle. Drugs were dissolved in
saline and infused in a volume of 3 ml over 3 min.
2.7. Stroke induction
During stroke induction, animals were placed in a clear Perspex
box to allow observation. Stroke was induced in conscious animals
by inserting a 30-gauge injector protruding 3 mm below the end of
the previously implanted guide cannula and ET-1 (20 pmol/ml in
saline; AusPep) was injected at a rate of 0.2 ml every 30 s until the
animal exhibited behavioural changes associated with the desired
level of stroke, as described previously (McCarthy et al., 2009, 2012,
2014). Typical behaviours that were observed were continuous
contralateral and ipsilateral circling; clenching, dragging, or failure
to extend the forelimb contralateral to the side of ET-1 infusion;
chewing and jaw ﬂexing and shufﬂing with forepaws. Each stroke
was graded based on these pre-determined behavioural changes
using a scale of 1e4, with 1 being a mild stroke and 4 being a severe
stroke. Only rats with a grade-4 level of stroke, exhibiting at least
ﬁve of the aforementioned behaviours, were used for the purpose
of this investigation.
2.8. Assessment of functional outcome
2.8.1. Ledged beam test
Stroke-induced changes in motor coordination were examined
by assessing the animal's dependence on the underhanging wider
ledge of a gradually narrowing beam as previously described
(McCarthy et al., 2012, 2009, 2014). Naïve rats are able to traverse
the central portion of the beam without using the underhanging
ledges for support. Stroked rats rely on the lower ledge for support
on the impaired side and take more steps on the ledge. Animals
were trained to traverse the beam on the day prior to surgical
implantation of the cannula. The ledged beam test was conducted
immediately before stroke induction, at 24 h (day 1) and ~70 h after
stroke induction (day 3). The number of steps taken on the lower
ledge (errors) by each foot was recorded and expressed as a percentage of the total number of footsteps taken and recorded as
percentage error. All values were compared to pre-stroke performance, and therefore each rat acted as its own control.
2.8.2. Neurological test
Postural abnormalities were assessed by grading the severity
of thorax twisting and the angle of forelimb extension when the
rat is elevated by the tail above a ﬂat surface (Yamamoto et al.,
1988). Thorax twisting was scored on a scale of 0e3, with 0 representing no twisting behaviour and 3 representing severe
twisting. Forelimb extension was also scored on a scale of 0e3,
with 0 representing full contralateral forelimb extension, and 3
representing a complete failure to extend the contralateral forelimb. Both scores were summed to give a total neurological deﬁcit
score, where the maximum total score an animal could achieve
was 6. A total score of zero indicated that the animal was normal
with no neurological deﬁcit evident, whereas a total score of 6
indicated sever neurological deﬁcit. The test was conducted prior
to surgery, immediately before stroke, and 24 h and 72 h after
stroke induction.

2.9. Histology
2.9.1. Quantiﬁcation of ischemic damage
At 72 h after stroke rats were re-anaesthetised with ketamine
(75 mg/kg; Sigma)/xylazine (10 mg/kg; Troy) and transcardially
perfused with physiologically buffered saline (0.1 M PBS; pH 7.4) at
a rate of 25 ml/min. Brains were then removed, snap frozen, and
sectioned for image analysis to determine infarct size, as previously
described (Callaway et al., 2000; McCarthy et al., 2009, 2012, 2014).
2.9.2. Immunohistochemical staining
Neuronal integrity was assessed using a neuron-speciﬁc marker,
NeuN antibody (1:500 dilution, Chemicon), which is a DNA-binding
protein that binds to the nucleus of neurons. In addition, cells undergoing apoptosis were identiﬁed using an antibody against a
common mediator in the apoptotic pathway, cleaved Caspase-3
(1:200 dilution, AbCAM). Frozen coronal cryostat sections (16 mm)
were post-ﬁxed using 100% acetone for 10 min. Slides were incubated overnight with either the NeuN or cleaved Caspase-3 antibody at 4  C. Sections were then incubated at room temperature for
2 h with a ﬂuorescently labelled secondary antibody: Alexa 488 was
used for NeuN (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen) and Alexa 568 for
cleaved Caspase-3 (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen). The number of
immunopositive cells were counted within six 1-mm2 sites that
were randomly imaged on the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres. Data are expressed as the average number of immunopositive cells per mm2.
2.10. Statistical analysis
Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation of the mean
(SD). The ledged beam test, neurological score, and systolic blood
pressure were analysed using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Neuronal expression (NeuN-positve cells)
and apoptosis (caspase-3-positive cells) were analysed by two way
ANOVA, while infarct area was analysed using a one-way ANOVA.
Post hoc testing, corrected for multiple comparisons, was performed using Tukey's test. A P value < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically signiﬁcant. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism (Version 6).
3. Results
3.1. Complexity of P. cambridgei venom (“PcTx1 venom”)
Venom from P. cambridgei has previously been used as a substitute for PcTx1 in stroke studies (Li et al., 2010; Pignataro et al.,
2007; Xiong et al., 2004) due to the lack of a commercial supplier.
Since spider venoms are extremely complex mixtures of salts, small
molecules, peptides and proteins (King and Hardy, 2013), we
decided to examine the relative abundance of PcTx1 peptide in
P. cambridgei venom. Fractionation of P. cambridgei venom using RPHPLC yielded a complicated chromatogram with more than 50
peaks, indicative of a highly complex venom (black trace in Fig. 1A).
The peak corresponding to native PcTx1 was conﬁrmed by comparison with the retention time of pure, recombinant PcTx1 eluted
under the same conditions (grey trace in Fig. 1A) as well as MALDITOF mass spectrometry (observed M þ Hþ ¼ 4687.32, calculated
M þ Hþ ¼ 4687.21). Integration of each of the peaks in the venom
chromatogram revealed that PcTx1 constitutes only ~0.4% of the
total venom based on absorbance at 214 nm. We conclude that
PcTx1 is found at very low abundance in P. cambridgei venom, and
therefore one cannot deﬁnitively conclude that the pharmacological effects evoked by “PcTx1 venom” in stroke studies are due
solely to PcTx1 inhibition of ASIC1a.

3.2. Activity of recombinant PcTx1 and “disarmed” mutant

3.3. Effect of PcTx1 on infarct size following MCAO

In order to examine the neuroprotective effects of pure PcTx1,
we produced recombinant PcTx1 as described previously (Saez
et al., 2011) as well as a double mutant version of the peptide
that was designed to be inactive on ASIC1a. Our previous structurefunction studies of PcTx1 (Saez et al., 2011) as well as crystal
structures of the complex formed between PcTx1 and chicken
ASIC1 (Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012; Dawson et al., 2012) indicate
that residues Arg27 and Val32 are important for PcTx1 inhibition of
ASIC1a. Thus, we produced an R27A/V32A double mutant peptide
(Fig. 1B) and examined the ability of this analogue to inhibit
rASIC1a. Electrophysiological analysis indicated that recombinant
wild-type PcTx1 inhibits rASIC1 with an IC50 of 0.82 ± 0.19 nM,
consistent with literature values (Escoubas et al., 2000; Saez et al.,
2011), whereas the R27A/V32A mutant is essentially inactive with
an IC50 > 10 mM (i.e., >10,000-fold lower potency) (Fig. 1C). Thus,
the disarmed R27A/V32A mutant PcTx1 provides a valuable control
to determine whether the in vivo effects of PcTx1 are due to inhibition of ASIC1a.

A single dose (1 ng/kg) of PcTx1 delivered i.c.v. 2 h after MCAO
had a dramatic impact on infarct size (Fig. 2). The cortical infarct
volume measured 72 h after MCAO was ~70% smaller in PcTx1treated animals (32 ± 30 mm3) compared to control animals
(108 ± 71 mm3; P < 0.05). Striatal infarct volume appeared lower in
PcTx1-treated animals (24.0 ± 8.4 mm3) compared to control animals (39 ± 27 mm3), but this did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. In
contrast with native PcTx1, the disarmed PcTx1 mutant had no
effect on the severity of cortical or striatal damage. The individual
infarct volume areas for each group are also shown in (Fig. 2). We
conclude that PcTx1 treatment reduces infarct size after stroke due
to pharmacological blockade of ASIC1a.
3.4. Effect of PcTx1 on motor deﬁcits following MCAO
Compared to pre-stroke measurements, there was a pronounced motor deﬁcit in vehicle-treated SHRs at both 1 and 3 days
after stroke (i.e., >40% error in the ledged-beam test; Fig. 3A). PcTx1

treatment (1 ng/kg i.c.v.) signiﬁcantly reduced the severity of motor
deﬁcit at 1 and 3 days after stroke compared to control rats (<10%
error in ledged-beam test; P < 0.01 versus corresponding time
points in vehicle-treated group) (Fig. 3A). In accordance with the
histological data, the inactive PcTx1 mutant had no effect on motor
deﬁcits after stroke (Fig. 3A).
3.5. Effect of PcTx1 on neurological scores following MCAO
A signiﬁcant neurological deﬁcit was observed at 1 and 3 days
after ET-1 induced stroke in both the control animals (1 day:
4.0 ± 1.9; 3 days: 3.3 ± 2.0; P < 0.01 versus pre-stroke deﬁcit) and
animals receiving inactive PcTx1 mutant (1 day: 4.9 ± 1.5; 3 days:
3.9 ± 1.3; P < 0.01 versus pre-stroke deﬁcit). Remarkably, there was
very little sign of neurological deﬁcit at either time point after
stroke (1 day: 0.7 ± 1.0; 3 days: 0.7 ± 0.9; P < 0.01 versus corresponding time points in vehicle-treated group; Fig. 3B) in animals
that received PcTx1.
3.6. Effect of PcTx1 on neuronal survival following MCAO
The number of neurons detected by NeuN-immunopositive
staining was lower in the infarcted (ipsilateral) hemisphere
compared to the non-infarcted (contralateral) hemisphere in both
vehicle-treated animals and those receiving the inactive PcTx1
mutant (Fig. 4), although only the latter reached statistical signiﬁcance (P < 0.01). Loss of NeuN-positive staining was much less
evident in the occluded hemisphere of animals treated with PcTx1
(P < 0.05), suggestive of improved neuronal survival in these
animals.
The number of cells undergoing apoptosis in the occluded
hemisphere of stroked SHRs receiving either vehicle or inactive
PcTx1 was higher than in the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 5), in
accordance with the decreased neuronal survival in the same
hemisphere (Fig. 4). Treatment with PcTx1 had an anti-apoptotic
effect in the occluded hemisphere as evidenced by a blunting of
the stroke-induced increase in the number of cells positive for
cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 5).

4. Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that PcTx1 affords both
functional and anatomical neuroprotection following induction of
stroke in conscious SHR. These protective effects were absent in
animals treated with a PcTx1 mutant that lacks activity against
ASIC1a, thus demonstrating, for the ﬁrst time, that the neuroprotection afforded by PcTx1 peptide is due to selective inhibition
of ASIC1a.
Stroke is the is the second leading cause of death worldwide
(Moskowitz et al., 2010; Woodruff et al., 2011) and the leading
cause of disability in industrialized countries (Liu et al., 2012). The
use of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) to help
restore blood ﬂow to the ischemic region is the only approved agent
for treatment of acute stroke and it is used in only 3e4% of all stroke
patients (Besancon et al., 2008) due to its narrow therapeutic
window and the risk of inducing intracranial hemorrhage
(Moskowitz et al., 2010). Thus, there is intense interest in developing new approaches for treatment of stroke victims.
Ischemia-induced acidosis causes neuronal injury independently
of the activation of voltage-gated calcium channels and glutamate
receptors. Activation of ASICs appears to represent a key mechanism
by which a reduction in the pH of ischemic tissue leads to calcium
inﬂux and excitotoxicity (O'Bryant et al., 2014). This distinct mechanism of excitotoxicity might in part explain the failure of NMDA
receptor antagonists in clinical trials against stroke (O'Bryant et al.,
2014). Infarct size is reduced by ~60% in ASIC1a knockout mice
(Xiong et al., 2004) which suggests that ASIC1a, the primary ASIC
subtype in rodent and human brain (Li et al., 2010), is a key
contributor to the pathological events induced by ischemic stroke.
Several studies have attempted to demonstrate a causal role for
ASIC1a in the neurodegeneration induced by cerebral ischemia by
employing nonselective small-molecule ASIC1 inhibitors such as
ﬂurbiprofen (Mishra et al., 2010, 2011) and aspirin (Wang et al.,
2012), “PcTx1 venom” (Pignataro et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2004),
or genetic ablation of ASIC1a (Xiong et al., 2004) as a means of
reducing ASIC1a function. NSAIDs such as ﬂurbiprofen and aspirin
are weak, nonselective inhibitors of ASIC1a and they affect a myriad

656

of other biological targets. Genetic ablation of an ion channel can
give rise to compensatory regulation of related subtypes of the
target channel with unknown consequences. As shown here,
“PcTx1 venom” contains only a very small amount of PcTx1
amongst many other venom peptides that likely affect a wide array
of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels (King and Hardy, 2013).
Thus, none of these approaches provides deﬁnitive evidence that
acute pharmacological inhibition of ASIC1a is likely to be neuroprotective in ischemic stroke.
Tarantula venoms are exceptionally complex chemical cocktails
dominated by disulﬁde-rich neurotoxic peptides (Herzig and King,
2013; King and Hardy, 2013). The primary molecular targets of
these peptides are neuronal voltage-gated calcium, sodium and
potassium channels (Herzig and King, 2013). We showed here that
PcTx1 constitutes a very minor proportion (~0.4%) of P. cambridgei
venom, which equates to a concentration of 40e80 mM in crude
venom. In comparison, the venom of this spider is known to
contain modulators of TRPV1 and voltage-gated potassium channels at concentrations in the 0.2e1.7 mM range (Choi et al., 2004;
Siemens et al., 2006). Thus, the in vivo effects of “PcTx1 venom”
are likely to be due to the combined effects from a wide variety of
venom peptides, rather than solely due to PcTx1 inhibition of
ASIC1a. Thus, we strongly recommend against using “PcTx1
venom” as a method to selectively inhibit ASIC1a in vivo.
We examined the effect of pure, recombinant PcTx1 using a
model of cerebral ischemia that closely mimics the clinical setting
in that animals are conscious while stroke is induced. This avoids
the confounding effects of anaesthesia, which are known to be
neuroprotective (McCarthy et al., 2012, 2009, 2014). Furthermore,
MCAO was performed on hypertensive animals, since high blood
pressure is an important risk factor for stroke. Additionally, the
hemodynamic changes induced via targeted application of ET-1 are
representative of human stroke, with blood ﬂow reduction at the
onset of ET-1 administration resulting in complete occlusion of the
vessel, which begins to resolve over a period of 30e40 min after
stroke with blood ﬂow returning to normal over the following
16e22 h (Mecca et al., 2009). The region of damage resulting from
this transient model of stroke is characterised by a necrotic core of
severely impacted tissue, surrounded by an ischemic penumbra of
compromised but salvageable neurons, which over time will
gradually undergo apoptotic cell death in the absence of therapeutic intervention. When administered centrally 2 h after stroke, a
single nanogram dose of pure PcTx1 almost halved the volume of
neuronal damage in SHRs, as measured three days post-insult.
PcTx1 not only afforded protection in the cortical region
(ischemic penumbra), but tended to reduce the severity of damage
in the striatal core (i.e., tissue directly impacted by hypoxia), which
is generally considered resistant to therapeutic intervention.
In previous studies, “PcTx1 venom” was administered at a dose
of 10 ng/kg in mice at 5 h after transient MCAO (Pignataro et al.,
2007), and immediately before and after stroke induction in rats
with transient MCAO, with the rat brain concentration estimated at
~50 ng/ml (Xiong et al., 2004). Given that PcTx1 represents ~0.4% of
crude P. cambridgei venom, the estimated brain concentration of
PcTx1 in these studies (0.2 ng/ml, ~0.03 nM) would have been
~15e30-fold lower than the reported IC50 for PcTx1 inhibition of
rASIC1a (Escoubas et al., 2000; Saez et al., 2011). This dose would
lead to only minimal inhibition of brain ASIC1a (<5%). Thus, it is
unclear whether the small amount of PcTx1 administered in previous studies (Pignataro et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2004) was solely
responsible for the observed neuroprotective effects or whether
they are due to the combined effect of several venom components.
In contrast, the dose of PcTx1 used in the current study equates to a
brain concentration of ~1.2 nM, which should inhibit brain ASIC1a
activity by >60%.

Earlier ﬁndings (Pignataro et al., 2008; Xiong et al., 2004)
showed that, “PcTx1 venom” markedly reduced infarct volume
when assessed 24 h after stroke, although no functional correlates
were examined. Notably, in the current study, the preservation of
brain tissue by PcTx1 was reﬂected symptomatically, with PcTx1treated animals experiencing less motor impairment and reduced
neurological deﬁcit following stroke. Moreover, the absence of
neuroprotection in animals receiving inactive PcTx1 mutant provides strong evidence that the neuroprotection afforded by PcTx1 is
due speciﬁcally to its ability to inhibit ASIC1a. PcTx1 (IC50
~0.5e1 nM) is a considerably more potent inhibitor of ASIC1a than
small molecules such as amiloride (IC50 ~10 mM) (Gründer and
Chen, 2010), ﬂurbiprofen (IC50 ~350 mM) (Voilley et al., 2001), and
sinomenine (IC50 ~0.27 mM) (Wu et al., 2011), and it is also much
more selective. Thus, the neuroanatomical and behavioural protection afforded by PcTx1 in the current study more convincingly
demonstrates the therapeutic potential of ASIC1a blockade as a
treatment for stroke.
Our immunohistochemical analysis indicated that stroke
markedly increased the number of cells undergoing apoptosis in
the ipsilateral hemisphere, but the number of caspase-3 positive
cells was reduced in PcTx1-treated animals. In the future, it would
be of interest to use other apoptotic assays, such as terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL), to
examine the PcTx1 treatment effect, particularly given that some
studies have shown that non-apoptotic cells such as reactive astrocytes, macrophages/microglia and neutrophils express caspase3 at 72 h after stroke (Nag et al., 2005; Wagner et al., 2011). In any
case, the increase in caspase-3 immunostaining in the area directly
affected by ischemia is consistent with the stroke-induced loss of
neuronal integrity, as identiﬁed by NeuN in the vehicle-treated
animals, which we have consistently reported (McCarthy et al.,
2009, 2012, 2014). Furthermore, treatment with PcTx1 blunted
the loss of NeuN staining, signifying a preservation of neuronal
survival. Thus, PcTx1 prevented apoptosis following MCAO, which
is in keeping with the conservation of neuronal architecture and is
reﬂected by both the histological and behavioural data.
The current study provides striking proof-of-principle that inhibition of central ASIC1a interrupts the pathological events
occurring after MCAO. However, the elucidation of the time course
of neuroprotection using clinically relevant routes of drug administration in several animal models is required before clinical
translation of these ﬁndings into humans (Fisher et al., 2009).
5. Conclusion
Selective inhibition of brain ASIC1a with pure PcTx1 peptide
provides functional- and anatomical-neuroprotection following
induction of stroke in conscious SHR. These ﬁndings indicate that
ASIC1a is an exciting therapeutic target after an ischemic event.
