We established an endothelin-1 model of anterior cerebral artery occlusion (ACAo).
Autoradiography and PET disclosed transient gradual ischemia of up to 4 h.
Comparable to abulia in humans, goal-directed executive functions deteriorated.
In contrast, hyperactivity predominated, if task-related stimuli were absent.
The model is well suited to study functional impairment and recovery after ACAo.

Background: Stroke patients suffering from occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery (ACAo) develop cognitive and executive deﬁcits. Experimental models to investigate such functional impairments and recovery
are rare and not satisfyingly validated.
New method: We stereotactically injected the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) close to the ACA of
rats and assessed magnitude and course of CBF reduction using [14 C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography
and [15 O]H2 O-PET. [18 F]FDG-PET and T2-weighted MRI determined regional metabolic and structural
alterations. To test cognitive and executive functions, we analyzed decision-making in a food-carrying
task, spatial working memory in a spontaneous alternation task and anxiety in an elevated plus maze
test before and 1 month after ACAo.
Results: CBF decreased immediately after ET-1 injection, started to recover 1–2 h and returned to
control 4 h thereafter. Metabolic and structural lesions developed permanently in the ACA territory.
Hypometabolism occurring bilaterally in the piriform region may reﬂect diaschisis. Behavioral testing
after ACAo revealed context-dependent changes in decision making, exploratory activity and walking
speed, as well as decreased anxiety and spatial working memory.
Comparison with existing method(s): Aside from modeling a known entity of stroke patients, ACAo in rats
allows to longitudinally study deterioration of cognitive and executive function without major interference by disturbed primary motor function. It complements therefore stroke research since common
models using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) all affect motor function severely.
Conclusion: The established ACAo model in rats effectively reﬂects deﬁcits characteristic for ACA stroke in
humans. It is furthermore highly suitable for longitudinal assessment of cognitive and executive functions.

1. Introduction
With almost 17 million strokes per year worldwide (Feigin et al.,
2014), 1.3–3.0% ischemic strokes in the territory of the anterior
cerebral artery (ACA) (Arboix et al., 2009; Bogousslavsky and Regli,
1990; Gacs et al., 1983; Kumral et al., 2002) lead to the considerable number of 220,000–507,000 new ACA patients annually. These
patients may suffer from discrete motor dysfunction but the most
prominent symptoms after ACA stroke are cognitive and executive
impairments (Kumral et al., 2002; Kang and Kim, 2008; Nagaratnam
et al., 1998). Thorough cognitive/executive testing has been conﬁned to case studies (Bird et al., 2004), revealing decreased ability
to perform voluntary actions (abulia) (Bogousslavsky, 1994). Abulia
refers to the reduction of spontaneous speech and to Parkinsonlike symptoms such as bradykinesia and hypokinesia (Kumral et al.,
2002; Nagaratnam et al., 2004). More extensive cognitive analyses
have been performed with patients suffering from a rupture of anterior communicating artery aneurysms, which results in ischemia
analog to ACA strokes (Böttger et al., 1998; Hütter and Gilsbach,
1992; Martinaud et al., 2009). According to the mentioned studies,
deﬁcits in anterograde and retrograde memory, selective attention,
task switching, planning, decision-making and concept formation
are likely to occur.
Unlike experimental models of middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo), models of the occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery
(ACAo) are only sporadically used. They may, however, serve as
models not only for this speciﬁc entity of human stroke but also,
in a more general sense, as models for the longitudinal study of
cognitive and executive function after stroke. An advantage is that
primary motor areas are supplied by the MCA, and therefore are
not directly affected by ACAo. In consequence, it is possible to
use behavioral tasks for the study of ischemia-induced cognitive
changes without major interference by disturbed motor function.
Previous behavioral experiments (simple and choice reaction time
tasks) 2 and 3 weeks after ACAo suggested that motivation and
attention remained intact, but executive functions were possibly
impaired (Ward et al., 1998).
We ﬁrst (study 1) developed and validated a rat model of ACA
occlusion (ACAo) on the basis of earlier work (Ward et al., 1998)
using the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) to occlude the ACA.
Our goal was to verify that ET-1 injection in proximity to the ACA
results in a pronounced reduction of cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) for
a time span long enough to produce ischemic damage (Hossmann,
1994). We investigated the magnitude of CBF reduction using quantitative [14 C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography, and the acute time
course using repetitive [15 O]H2 O ␮PET.
The second goal (study 2) was to investigate executive functions
longitudinally during the ﬁrst month after ACAo. The main behavioral paradigm mimicked a natural foraging situation, where rats
encounter food in the open and have to decide how to deal with it:
either eat it at the food patch or carry it to their burrow (Takahashi
and Lore, 1980). These food-handling decisions were studied in a
meander maze where food was laid out, with the rat’s home cage
attached. Because spatial working memory and anxiety are important factors inﬂuencing decision-making in our food-carrying task,
these functions were additionally investigated using a spontaneous
alternation test in the Y-maze and an elevated plus maze test. Here
we report ACAo-induced behavioral alterations and alterations of
regional metabolic brain activity in affected brain areas.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Experiments were carried out in accordance with the EU directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments and the German Animal

Welfare Act (TierSchG, 2006), and were approved by regional
authorities (LANUV NRW). For validation of the ACAo model
(study 1), 13 male Lister hooded rats (approx. 10 weeks old;
Harlan, Borchen, Germany) were used to quantify CBF reduction
with [14 C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography, and two for repetitive
intraindividual CBF measurements using [15 O]H2 O ␮PET imaging.
In the behavioral study (study 2), 26 rats (approx. 10 weeks old at
start) were used for behavioral testing, and a subgroup of 10 rats
underwent sequential PET imaging. All rats were pair-housed and
maintained in an inverted 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 8 pm).
While rats for autoradiography and repetitive CBF measurements
were fed ad libitum, rats used for the behavioral study obtained a
restricted diet of 80% of their free-feeding amount of food (2018
Teklad global 18% protein rodent diet; Harlan; 15–20 g) per day.
Animals were weighed twice per week. Body weight was 276–324 g
at the start of experiments.
2.2. Intracerebral ET-1 injection for ACA ischemia
ACAo or sham operation took place after the ﬁrst sequence of
behavioral testing and was performed by a single injection of ET-1
or vehicle near the pericallosal part of the ACA. Rats were anesthetized using 5% isoﬂurane (delivered in 70% N2 O and 30% O2 )
and ﬁxed in a stereotactic frame, where isoﬂurane concentration
was reduced to 2.5%. Body temperature was measured with a rectal
probe, and held constant at 37 ◦ C using a heating pad. After removing skin and periost, a small hole (approx. 1 mm in diameter) was
drilled midline 1.5 mm rostral from bregma, and the 26 G cannula
of a Hamilton syringe was inserted 3 mm deep, measured from the
level of the dura mater. ET-1 (150 pmol in 0.3 ␮l sterile PBS) was
then injected with a rate of 0.2 ␮l/min in close proximity of the
ACA (Fig. 1D). In sham operated animals, 0.3 ␮l PBS was injected.
The cannula was left in place for 10 min, and then retracted. Minor
bleeding from the sagittal sinus, which was pierced by the passage of the cannula, occurred in most cases. After the bleeding had
stopped (after approx. 1 min), the burr hole was closed using bone
wax and the skin wound was sutured followed by application of a
local anesthetic (Lidocain gel).
2.3. Quantitative autoradiographic CBF measurements (study 1)
For autoradiography, 13 rats were initially anesthetized with 5%
isoﬂurane in 70% N2 O and 30% O2 and maintained at 2% isoﬂurane.
Rectal temperature was kept at 37 ◦ C using a feedback-controlled
heating system. Polyethylene catheters were inserted into both
femoral veins and arteries for i.v. tracer application and arterial
sampling for blood gas analysis and tracer input function. Two time
points were chosen: early ischemia (17–20 min; 5 ET-1 injected rats
and 3 shams), and later ischemia (2 h; 3 ET-1 and 2 shams).
The [14 C]iodoantipyrine (IAP) technique was employed as
described previously (Sakurada et al., 1978). Ten ␮Ci/100 g body
weight of [14 C]IAP dissolved in 1 ml of 0.9% saline (speciﬁc activity 55 mCi/mmol; Biotrend GmbH, Cologne, Germany) was applied
via i.v. ramp infusion while taking arterial blood samples onto
pre-weighed ﬁlter paper. After 60 s, animals were sacriﬁced by
i.v. injection of saturated KCl solution to stop tracer delivery to
the brain. Brains were removed quickly, frozen in methylbutane at
−40 ◦ C, and stored at −80 ◦ C. Blood samples were weighed immediately after termination of experiments and placed in counting
vials. A 5 ml scintillation cocktail was added, and [14 C]-radioactivity
was measured in a scintillation counter (Wallace 1410, Pharmacia,
Freiburg, Germany) using external quench correction.
Brains were cut into 20 ␮m cryostat sections (Leica CM3050,
Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), which were dried
on a heating plate to prevent diffusion of the radioactive tracer.
Sections were exposed to autoradiographic ﬁlm (Hyperﬁlm ECL,

[14 C]-polymer standards for 12 days. After ﬁlm development
autoradiograms were digitized using a charge-coupled device camera (Sony SSCM370CE, Sony Incorporation of America, Cypress, CA,
U.S.A.) operated by a Macintosh IIfx computer. Image processing
was carried out with ImageMG, a user-revised version of the
public domain program NIH-Image (W. Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Local CBF values from the
autoradiograms were calculated with the in-build operational
equations employing local tissue [14 C]-radioactivities and corresponding [14 C]-input functions. Due to the quick removal of the
brain the olfactory bulb was damaged in most of the animals, so
that this region was not analyzed with IAP autoradiography.
2.4. PET imaging
PET scans were performed in a Focus 220 ␮PET scanner
(CTI/Siemens Knoxville, TN; resolution at center of ﬁeld of view:
1.4 mm) under isoﬂurane anesthesia. Respiratory rate was held
at 50–70 breaths per minute by manually adjusting isoﬂurane
concentration (2.0–2.5% delivered in 70% N2 O and 30% O2 ). Body
temperature was measured with a rectal probe and held at 37 ◦ C
using warm water ﬂow through the animal holder. A transmission
scan of approx. 10 min with a 68 Ge source was used for attenuation
correction of all scans.

For the repetitive CBF protocol (study 1), two animals were used.
[15 O]H2 O (1.9–2.6 mCi in 500 ␮l) was injected via a tail vein in the
baseline scans, and through a catheter in the femoral vein at later
time points. One rat underwent ACAo and the other sham operation. CBF was measured every 30 min for 2 h, beginning approx.
30 min after ET-1/sham injection. In the ET-1 injected rat, CBF was
subsequently measured every full hour up to 5 h after occlusion.
After the end of PET scans, the rats were sacriﬁced by injecting 2 ml
saturated KCl through the venous catheter.
In the behavioral study (study 2), 10 rats (8 ET-1, 2 shams) were
measured. [15 O]H2 O (1.0–1.8 mCi in 0.5 ␮l) was injected via a tail
vein before and 40–61 min after ACAo. Emission data were acquired
for 5 min, starting with tracer injection. After Fourier rebinning,
data were reconstructed using two-dimensional ﬁltered back projection, resulting in voxel sizes of 0.48 mm × 0.48 mm × 0.82 mm.
In the same animals, [18 F]ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG; 0.9–1.5 mCi in
500 ␮l, injected through a tail vein) was used to investigate glucose metabolism. Emission data acquisition was 1 h starting with
tracer injection. The rats underwent three metabolic scans: Before,
63–80 min, and 1 month after ACAo. Fourier rebinning was followed
by an OSEM3D/MAP reconstruction (Qi et al., 1998), yielding voxel
sizes of 0.38 mm × 0.38 mm × 0.82 mm.
Images were analyzed with the help of the imaging tool
VINCI (Vollmar et al., 2007), where all images were manually coregistered. Intensity ratio normalization was performed using the

282

cerebellum as a reference region. Relative values are accordingly
given as % cerebellum.
To demonstrate the ischemic lesion in the brain midline, a proﬁle
analysis was carried out over all images. A proﬁle (length: 25.3 mm,
width 2.0 mm) was placed on a horizontal section at a depth of
1.8 mm from dorsal brain surface (Fig. 1D, orange dashed line;
Fig. 3B; Fig. 5B). Mean proﬁle plots (data point spacing: 160 ␮m)
were drawn for each time point, and were compared using twoway repeated measures ANOVA (factor 1: time point; factor 2: data
point) with post hoc Holm–Sidak multiple comparisons procedure.
2.5. MRI
To investigate the structural lesion caused by ET-1 injection,
T2-weighted MRI was performed with all 26 animals of the behavioral study (study 2) with the help of a 4.7-T BioSpec animal
scanner with a 30-cm horizontal bore magnet (Bruker BioSpin,
Ettlingen, Germany). Radio frequency transmission was achieved
with a Helmholtz coil (diameter: 12 cm) and the signal was detected
with a 22 mm-diameter surface receiver coil, positioned above the
skull of the animal. T2-weighted images were acquired with a
multislice multiecho Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence:
TR/TE = 4000/11.0 ms, 16 echoes, FOV = 3 × 4 cm2 , slice thickness:
1.0 mm, interslice distance: 0.0 mm, matrix: 128 × 128. Anesthesia, control of breathing rate and body temperature were similar to
the ␮PET scans. Images were acquired before and 24 h after ACAo,
imported in VINCI, and co-registered. With the help of a threshold tool, the lesioned areas were selected and transformed to VOIs,
whose volume was collected analog to the infarct volume. After 1
month, the measurement was repeated, and images were examined
for structural changes (atrophy, ventricular enlargement, cysts).
2.6. Behavioral testing
We carried out several behavioral tests to measure decisionmaking (food-carrying task; n = 8 ET-1 plus 7 shams), anxiety
(elevated plus maze; n = 16 ET-1 plus 10 shams), and spatial working memory (spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze; n = 16 ET-1
plus 10 shams). Rats were tested before ACAo and during the ﬁrst
month (from 2nd to 4th week) after ACAo.
All behavioral testing was executed during the dark phase under
red light conditions (660 nm). The two testing phases required 2
weeks each, and were performed in an isolated air conditioned
chamber with a controlled temperature of constantly 22 ◦ C. After
putting the rat in the test arena, the experimenter left the chamber
and the behavior was digitally recorded and surveyed from outside
the chamber. Food-carrying task and elevated plus maze test were
then analyzed further by using a video tracking system (Ethovision
3.1, Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands).

For ofﬂine analysis we deﬁned a food-carrying probability score,
which was assigned to each trip (=from cage to food and back). If
rats carried their food all the way to the cage, this trip counted as
100% food-carrying. Those trips where rats ate their food directly
at the food patch were counted as 0% food-carrying. If a rat started
carrying its food to the cage but then stopped on the way to eat,
the trip received a value between 0 and 100%, depending on the
distance moved. For example, if the rat went 25% of the total distance toward the cage, the trip received 25% food-carrying. We
calculated an average food-carrying value for each animal. In addition, we measured the number of trips, total distance moved, and
velocity.
2.8. Elevated plus maze
To measure anxiety we used an elevated plus maze, a platform
with two enclosed and two open arms (length: 50 cm, width: 12 cm;
wall 34 cm), mounted 50 cm above ground. Rats were separately
placed in the center of the maze facing one of the closed arms.
Their movements were digitally recorded for 10 min and analyzed
with Ethovision (Noldus). We measured the time rats spent in the
different zones (open arms, enclosed arms, center) as well as the
frequency of zone entry. Each rat was tested on two consecutive
days and averages for each rat were calculated.
2.9. Spontaneous alternation test
We performed this test in a Y-maze with an arm length of 70 cm
and a width of 13 cm. At the beginning rats were placed separately
at the end of the starting arm. When the rat had entered one of
the target arms and had proceeded to its end, it was taken back to
its cage. The arena was cleaned thoroughly to remove all olfactory
cues, and after approx. 1 min, testing was repeated. It was recorded
whether the rat alternated in arm choice or went twice into the
same arm. Animals were tested once per day on 3 consecutive days,
and out of this the percentage of alternation was calculated.
2.10. Data analysis
Behavioral data were compared using a two-way mixed ANOVA
with Tukey post hoc testing. Between-subjects factor was treatment (ET-1 and sham), within-subjects factor was time point
(before and after treatment). For correlation analysis, the Pearson
test was used. All percentage values were arcus sinus transformed
before statistical analysis. SigmaPlot 11.0 (Systat Software, San José,
CA, USA) with the integrated statistics tool SigmaStat was used for
statistical analysis.
3. Results
3.1. Tolerability of ET-1 injection

2.7. Food carrying task
The arena (1.5 m × 1.0 m) was a meander shaped gangway
covered with a transparent plexiglas lid. It consisted of 10 interconnected straight corridors (1 m long, 15 cm wide), with a total
length of 10 m. At one end of the gangway the individual home
cages could be attached, so that the rats could go back and forth
freely between cage and arena. During 10 days of training the rats
learned to accept food in the arena. For the test, 10 pieces of food
(0.5 g fruit loops, plus family) were placed in the alley. Each day,
the food was presented at a different distance from cage (2–10 m
in 2 m-steps, random order). Rats were tested separately once per
day for 20 min or until all food was collected/eaten. Rats were digitally recorded from above, and their movement was analyzed with
Ethovision (Noldus).

We found that ET-1 and vehicle injection was well tolerated by
the animals. None of the rats died during surgery or thereafter.
3.2. Study 1: ACAo model validation
3.2.1. [14 C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography
Quantitative [14 C]iodoantipyrine autoradiographic analysis
revealed that after ET-1 injection, CBF was strongly reduced within
the ACA territory to at least 0.02 ml/g/min after 17 min and to
0.34 ml/g/min after 2 h in the cingulate cortex (Fig. 2, columns 3 and
4). Compared to the respective values after sham (vehicle) injection, this corresponds to a mean CBF reduction of 82% (17 min) and
61% (2 h) in the cingulate cortex. A strong CBF decrease was also
seen in the prelimbic cortex (on average of 72% after 17 min and of

regarded as normal (i.e., 0.8–1.4 ml/g/min). ET-1 strongly decreased CBF in the ACA territory 17 min after injection with partial reperfusion after 2 h. Numbers on the left
indicate rostrocaudal coordinates of sections with respect to Bregma.

3.2.2. Repetitive [15 O]H2 O-PET
Repetitive measurements of relative CBF (intensity normalized
to cerebellum) were performed in two rats, one receiving ET-1
(5 h measurements), and the other vehicle injection (2 h measurements). After ET-1 injection, CBF was reduced in the ACA territory
to <50% baseline, with the lowest values in the olfactory bulb and
frontal cortex (Fig. 1). The septum was affected as well. CBF reduction peaked at the early measurements 30 min and/or 1 h after
injection, and recovered thereafter slowly to baseline levels, which
were reached after 4 h.
In line with the results obtained by quantitative autoradiography, a moderate CBF reduction (to >80% baseline) was observed
in the MCA territory as well, particularly in the piriform cortex
(Fig. 1A). This hypoperfusion could be followed by a delayed hyperperfusion in the MCA territory.
In the control animal, a moderate CBF reduction (to around 85%
baseline) occurred near the vehicle injection site in the anterior part
of the ACC (Fig. 1C). In the other areas, CBF changes did not exceed
noise level (±10%, determined by repetitive baseline scans).

33% after 2 h) and the secondary motor cortex M2 (on average of
49% after 17 min and 45% after 2 h). For other regional mean values
see Table 1. In individual animals, CBF reduction eventually spread
unilaterally into the MCA territory and affected the somatosensory
cortex rather severely (minimum 0.14 ml/g/min). In most cases,
these CBF reductions in the MCA territory were mild but consistently seen and remained for 2 h after ET-1 injection. This effect
was most pronounced in the piriform region, where minimum perfusion was 0.32 ml/g/min after 17 min (mean CBF decrease of 11%
compared to sham), and 0.71 ml/g/min after 2 h (mean CBF decrease
of 30% compared to sham).
Immediately (17 min) following vehicle injection, a mild reduction of CBF was also observed in the ACA territory of sham animals
(0.37 ml/g/min in the prelimbic cortex; see Fig. 2, ﬁrst column) and
in the MCA territory (0.38 ml/g/min in the piriform region). In contrast to ET-1 injection, however, CBF was completely restored 2 h
after sham injection (1.0 and 1.5 ml/g/min; see Fig. 2, column 2).
This demonstrates a transient but considerable effect on the whole
cerebral cortex by the injection procedure itself.

ACAo

signiﬁcant decrease of FDG uptake occurred also in lateral parts of
the brain, particularly in the piriform region.

3.3.1. Acute [15 O]H2 O-PET
CBF was measured with [15 O]H2 O approximately 45 min after
ET-1 injection (n = 8). The same was done with two sham-operated
animals. Proﬁle analysis demonstrated that ET-1 signiﬁcantly
reduced CBF around the injection site and up to 7 mm rostral to
on average 70% of baseline (Fig. 3A). In the sham animals, a small
zone with CBF reduction to 80% baseline could be found as well
reaching approx. 3 mm rostral from the injection site (Fig. 3C).
Voxel-based analysis in ET-1 animals revealed a statistically signiﬁcant CBF reduction in the whole ACA territory including the
septum (see t-map in Fig. 4). In lateral parts of the brain, including
the piriform region, CBF changes were not signiﬁcant.

3.3.3. Structural MRI
Twenty-four hours after ET-1 injection, T2-weighted MR images
revealed a hyperintense signal in the ACA territory representing structural loss and cerebral edema (Fig. 4, right column).
Affected regions matched the regions of reduced blood ﬂow visible in [14 C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography (Fig. 2, third column).
Mean infarct volume calculated from the hyperintense regions was
73.5 ± 43.4 mm3 in the 16 animals injected with ET-1. In addition,
a hyperintense signal occurred in the piriform region of three animals (one unilateral, two bilateral). After 1 month, the ischemic
lesion was still visible in the ET-1 injected rats (Fig. 6, right column), accompanied by ventricular enlargement and loss of tissue,
particularly in midline cortex and septum. In the 10 sham operated animals, the hyperintense signal after 24 h was restricted to
the injection site, comprising 2.6 ± 5.6 mm3 . After 1 month, the
small edema around the injection site had disappeared completely
without any signs of structural damage.

3.3.2. Acute and chronic [18 F]FDG-PET
Medial proﬁle analysis of [18 F]FDG images after ET-1 injection
revealed a decrease of relative metabolic activity. An initial reduction of FDG uptake 1 h after ET-1 injection was most prominent in
the olfactory bulb (to 80% baseline; Fig. 5) and around the injection
site (to 90% baseline). In the olfactory bulb, a partial recovery was
apparent after one month. A delayed reduction of metabolic activity to 80% baseline occurred at the frontal pole of the brain and also
caudally from the injection site after 1 month. In the sham animals,
an initial metabolic reduction around the injection site, but not in
the olfactory bulb, was seen as well, which was fully recovered by
one month after injection. Voxel-based comparison between baseline and one month after ET-1 injection conﬁrmed the reduction
of metabolic activity in the ACA territory (Fig. 6). Furthermore, a

from 86 ± 25% before ET-1 injection to 60 ± 42% after 1 month
(Fig. 7A). In the seven control rats, food-carrying remained constant
at 73 ± 28% before and 72 ± 31% after sham injection. However,
there were neither signiﬁcant main effects of treatment or time
point, nor a signiﬁcant factor interaction. Because of the high
standard deviations of both food carrying after ACAo and of infarct
volume, we performed a correlation analysis between the two

animals as shown in Fig. 3, projected onto an MRI template, before (ﬁrst column) and 45 min after ET-1 injection (second column). The third column shows the respective

baseline (black line). Abbreviations: Cer: cerebellum; Cg1,2: anterior cingulate cortex 1, 2; In: injection site; olf. bulb: olfactory bulb; PrL: prelimbic cortex; RSG: retrosplenial

variables. We found a signiﬁcant negative correlation (R = −0.75;
p = 0.0321; Fig. 7C), indicating that the bigger the infarct, the lower
food-carrying probability.
Food-carrying probability was inﬂuenced by distance between
food and home-cage (F(4,52) = 3.64; p = 0.0109) before ET-1/sham
injection, with 2 m distance having a higher probability for
food-carrying than 8 m and 10 m (p < 0.05). However, post hoc comparisons separately performed for sham and ACAo groups revealed
that this effect was signiﬁcant in the sham group only, and disappeared after ET-1/sham injection (F(4,52) = 2.22; p = 0.08).
Food-carrying velocity (Fig. 7D) was reduced after ACAo from
46 ± 9 cm/s before to 34 ± 12 cm/s after 1 month. In control animals, velocity was not decreased after sham injection (45 ± 6 cm/s
before, 47 ± 7 cm/s after injection). While main effects of factors
treatment and time point were not signiﬁcant, there was a signiﬁcant factor interaction (F(1,13) = 5.56; p = 0.0348). Post hoc testing
revealed a signiﬁcant difference between velocity of ET-1 injected
animals before versus after ACAo, as well as a signiﬁcant difference
between velocity of ET-1 versus sham rats after injection (p < 0.05).
ACAo reduced the number of trips from 36 ± 12 to 25 ± 12.
In sham animals, the number of trips was reduced as well, from
33 ± 11 to 27 ± 10. There was a signiﬁcant main effect of time point
(F(1,13) = 5.97; p = 0.0296), and post hoc testing showed a signiﬁcant difference of the number of trips before versus after injection in
the ET-1 group (p < 0.05). Consequently, the total distance moved
was reduced as well from 406 ± 86 m before ACAo to 293 ± 97 m
after one month in ET-1 rats, and from 373 ± 94 m to 294 ± 55 in
sham animals. Factor time point had a signiﬁcant main effect on
total distance moved (F(1,13) = 11.59; p = 0.0047), and post hoc testing revealed a signiﬁcant difference of total distance moved before
versus after ET-1 injection (p < 0.05).
3.3.4.2. Spontaneous alternation. ACAo reduced spontaneous alternation from 75 ± 28% before to 48 ± 30% after ET-1 injection
(Fig. 8). In control animals, spontaneous alternation remained high:
83 ± 24% before and 87 ± 23% after sham injection. ANOVA revealed
a signiﬁcant main effect of treatment (F(1,24) = 6.24; p = 0.0197),
and a signiﬁcant factor interaction (F(1,24) = 8.14; p = 0.0088).
Within the ET-1 group there was a signiﬁcant difference between
before and after ACAo (p < 0.05), and at time point “after injection”
there was a signiﬁcant difference between the ET-1 and sham group
(p < 0.05).
3.3.4.3. Elevated plus maze. ACAo increased open arm time (% of
total time) and open arm entries (% of total zone entries), indicating decreased anxiety. Open arm time increased from 35 ± 19% to
57 ± 15%, and open arm entries from 24 ± 8% to 35 ± 6% (Fig. 9A
and C). In sham animals, both variables increased only slightly,

open arm time from 41 ± 14% to 49 ± 9%, and open arm entries from
27 ± 5% to 29 ± 6%. Time point had a signiﬁcant main effect on both
open arm time (F(1,24) = 8.30; p = 0.0082) and open arm entries
(F(1,24) = 9.49; p = 0.0051) with a signiﬁcant difference between
before and after injection in the ET-1 group (p < 0.05).
The total frequency of zone entries, which represents a measure
for exploratory activity, increased in ET-1 animals after 1 month
from 79 ± 35 to 126 ± 47. In control rats it remained constant at
103 ± 37 zone entries before and 102 ± 22 after sham injection
(Fig. 9D). Factor time point had a signiﬁcant main effect on zone
entries (F(1,24) = 6.94; p = 0.0145), and there was a signiﬁcant factor
interaction (F(1,24) = 7.31; p = 0.0124). In the ET-1 group, number
of zone entries was signiﬁcantly higher after 1 month than before
ACAo (p < 0.05).
In contrast to the decrease of food-carrying velocity that was
found after ACAo, walking speed in the elevated plus maze
increased from 16 ± 3 cm/s to 23 ± 9 cm/s on the open arms,
and from 16 ± 3 cm/s to 22 ± 5 cm/s on the closed arms. In
sham animals, velocity remained constant at 12 ± 5 cm/s before
and 11 ± 4 cm/s after sham injection on the open arms, and at
13 ± 4 cm/s before and 12 ± 4 cm/s after sham injection on the
closed arms. Treatment had a signiﬁcant main effect on velocity both on the open (F(1,23) = 21.23; p = 0.0001) and closed arms
(F(1,24) = 26.79; p < 0.0001), while factor time point signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced velocity on closed arms only (F(1,24) = 6.45; p = 0.018).
For both open and closed arms there was a signiﬁcant factor
interaction (F(1,23) = 5.77; p = 0.0248 for open arms; F(1,24) = 7.72;
p = 0.104 for closed arms). Post hoc comparison revealed that animals of the ACAo group were signiﬁcantly faster after ET-1 injection
than before, on both open and closed arms (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 1
month after injection velocity was signiﬁcantly higher in the ACAo
group compared to sham group for both open and closed arms
(p < 0.05).
4. Discussion
4.1. Changes of perfusion after ACAo (study 1 and 2)
In the acute phase after injection of the vasoconstrictor ET-1,
repetitive [15 O]H2 O-PET demonstrated the course of CBF reduction
for up to 2 h and subsequent recovery with normalization after
approximately 4 h. CBF reduction was highest and lasted longest
in the anterior cingulate cortex. Other regions of the ACA territory, some of them located rostral to the ET-1 injection site, were
affected as well, but were reperfused somewhat earlier. Rostral
vasoconstriction was most likely mediated by ACA branches, which
originate near the injection site, and run in an anterodorsal direction (see Fig. 1). In addition, upstream vasoconstriction may have

contributed as well, caused by ET-1 diffusion along the ACA or by
conducted vasoconstriction due to upstream signaling (Gustafsson
and Holstein-Rathlou, 1999). Compared to the study of Ward et al.
(Ward et al., 1998) we injected ET-1 at a more distal segment of the
ACA, approximately at the border between prelimbic cortex and
anterior cingulate cortex. This explains why other, more proximally
located regions like the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and
diagonal band of Broca have not been affected in our study. ET-1
has been used in other stroke models to produce infarcts in the
MCA territory or lacunar infarcts in rats (Cordova et al., 2014; Fuxe
et al., 1997; Joo et al., 2012; Livingston-Thomas et al., 2013; Roome
et al., 2014), mice (Soylu et al., 2012), and marmosets (Virley et al.,
2004), with the duration of CBF reduction being comparable to our
results.
Quantitative [14 C]iodoantipyrine autoradiography revealed that
CBF was reduced to less than 0.1 ml/g/min (<10% baseline) 17 min
after ET-1 injection. This is in line with studies investigating
early ET-1 action and showing that vasoconstriction is maximal
during the ﬁrst 15–30 min after injection (Nikolova et al., 2009;
Regenhardt et al., 2013). Subsequently, blood vessels slowly begin
to dilate, depending on local ET-1 concentration. This may explain
why our earliest [15 O]H2 O-PET measurements performed at 30 min
after ET-1 injection merely showed a CBF reduction to 70% baseline.
4.2. Metabolic changes after ACAo (study 2)
For interpretation of [18 F]FDG-PET results we have to keep
in mind that FDG uptake took place under anesthesia, where
cortico-cortical as well as thalamo-cortical networks are severely
altered (Bonhomme et al., 2012) and glucose metabolism is strongly
decreased, particularly in thalamus and cortex (Prieto et al., 2011).
Glutamatergic excitatory activity, which accounts for 80% of the
brain’s energy consumption in the awake state (Raichle and Mintun,
2006), is reduced during isoﬂurane anesthesia so that FDG uptake
presumably reﬂects for the most part inhibitory activity, basic
housekeeping functions (e.g., protein trafﬁcking), and possibly
activation of the adrenergic system (Boretius et al., 2013). The
“metabolic lesions” observed in the ACA territory and elsewhere

therefore represent mainly general loss of brain cells as well as disturbance of the inhibitory part of functional brain networks. Proﬁle
analysis of [18 F]FDG-PET starting 1 h after ET-1 injection showed
substantial metabolic reduction in the olfactory bulb, but not in
the other areas of reduced CBF. This may be explained by the fact
that in ischemic tissue with some residual blood ﬂow FDG inﬂux
can be normal or even elevated 1 h after occlusion, because reduced
glucose supply is compensated for by increased glucose phosphorylation (Backes et al., 2011; Walberer et al., 2012). After 1 month, FDG
uptake had recovered in the olfactory bulb. This may result at least
to some extent from neuronal progenitor cell traveling with the
rostral migratory stream from the subventricular zone to the olfactory bulb (Liu and Guthrie, 2011). However, since migration is very
slow (the full journey takes at least 75 days; (Whitman and Greer,
2009)) and only interneurons are replaced (Liu and Guthrie, 2011),
other mechanisms must have contributed to metabolic recovery.
In contrast to the olfactory bulb, FDG uptake was further decreased
in the anterior cingulate cortex, prelimbic/infralimbic cortex, and
septum, reﬂecting loss of tissue as conﬁrmed by MRI.
Voxel-based analysis showed that a signiﬁcant decrease of
relative metabolic activity did not only occur in the ACA territory, but also in lateral cortical regions, particularly in the
piriform area. Furthermore, a piriform hyperintense signal was
found in structural MR images 24 h after ET-1 injection in three
animals. There was no signiﬁcant CBF reduction detectable with
[15 O]H2 O-PET in this area of the same animals 45 min after ACAo,
although IAP autoradiography with other rats has indicated that
this can indeed occur, as described for human stroke patients
(Rubin et al., 2000). The metabolic reduction in the piriform region
therefore may reﬂect a remote, diaschisis-like effect that is presumably independent of CBF changes. Diaschisis is a phenomenon
related to all kinds of focal brain lesions, where impairments
can spread to remote areas functionally connected to the original site of damage (Finger et al., 2004). The rat piriform cortex
is reciprocally connected to the prelimbic and infralimbic region,
fulﬁlling in our case the anatomical prerequisite of diaschisis
(Datiche and Cattarelli, 1996; Heidbreder and Groenewegen, 2003;
Johnson et al., 2000). In MCA stroke patients crossed cerebellar

H. Endepols et al. / Journal of Neuroscience Methods 253 (2015) 279–291

diaschisis is common, leading to chronic reduction of FDG uptake in
the contralateral cerebellum (Agrawal et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2006).
Acute and subacute studies of transhemispheric cortical diaschisis
after MCAo report transient contralesional hyperexcitability with
increased FDG uptake upon sensory stimulation during the ﬁrst
week (Mohajerani et al., 2011). However, this does not result in
chronic hypometabolism, and is interpreted as circuit remodeling in the course of functional compensation by the contralateral
cortical area (Takatsuru et al., 2009). One mechanism underlying
hyperexcitability during transhemispheric diaschisis is the breakdown of inhibitory synaptic transmission (Imbrosci et al., 2014),
which may cause excitotoxicity and death of neurons in susceptible areas. Interestingly, both cerebellum and piriform cortex are
selectively vulnerable to excitotoxicity (Candelario-Jalil et al., 2001;
Welsh et al., 2002). We therefore conclude that hypometabolism in
midline brain areas after ACAo is caused by the ischemic lesion,
while reduced FDG uptake in lateral cortical regions is related to
diaschisis-like phenomena.
4.3. Effect of ACAo on decision-making during foraging
In order to test alterations of decision-making strategies in rats,
we used a food-carrying task whose basic principles were developed more than 60 years ago (Bindra, 1948; Morgan, 1947; Wolfe,
1939). The rat encounters food in a meander-shaped arena and has
two alternatives, namely carrying the food back to the cage or eating
it directly at the food patch (Whishaw et al., 1990). This is reﬂected
by the food-carrying probability score, which was inversely correlated to infarct size, suggesting that areas of the ACA territory are
involved in the food-handling decision. This is in line with other
studies implicating anterior cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens in foraging strategies (Whishaw and Kornelsen, 1993; Li et al.,
2012). Closely associated with food-carrying probability was the
number of food-carrying trips, total distance moved, and walking
speed, which were all signiﬁcantly reduced after ACAo, but not after
sham operation. We can therefore conclude that food-handling
decisions had changed after ACAo favoring less motor activity. It
is unlikely that this was caused by a disturbance of the primary
motor system, since the same animals showed increased walking
speed on the elevated plus maze (see below). However, ischemic
lesions in the secondary motor cortex M2 may have contributed to
behavioral changes, since M2 neurons are involved in self-initiated
actions (Murakami et al., 2014).
Several factors inﬂuence the food-handling decision, including
emotional parameters as shyness, fear, and anxiety (Dringenberg
et al., 1994, 2000). To test anxiety in our rats we used the elevated plus maze test, where animals can move freely between
two enclosed and two open arms of an elevated platform. Relative open arm time and relative number of open arm entries
are inverse measures of anxiety, whereas the total number of
zone entries reﬂects exploratory activity (Doremus et al., 2006;
Rodgers and Johnson, 1995). Both open arm time and open arm
entries increased 1 month after ACAo, but remained constant in
sham animals, suggesting that after ACAo, animals were less anxious than before. This is in line with ﬁndings emphasizing the
role of the orbitofrontal-infralimbic/prelimbic-amygdala network
(Rempel-Clower, 2007; Sotres-Bayon and Quirk, 2010) and also the
cingulate cortex (Albrechet-Souza et al., 2009; Maier et al., 2012)
and nucleus accumbens (Yorgason et al., 2013) for anxiety-like
behavior. Our ﬁndings therefore suggest that at least part of the
reduction of food-carrying and walking speed may be attributed to
a decrease of anxiety directly caused by the focal ischemic lesion.
Distance between food and refuge is another important factor
for the food-handling decision. Long distances lead to extended
travel times in case of food-carrying, which may be worthwhile
only when food eating time is also long (Whishaw et al., 1990;

289

Nakatsuyama and Makino, 1999; Whishaw and Dringenberg, 1991;
Whishaw and Tomie, 1989). Particularly these economic factors
have been investigated in relation to optimal foraging theory
(Whishaw and Dringenberg, 1991; Lima et al., 1985; Phelps and
Roberts, 1989; Whishaw, 1990), which describes the trade-off
between predatory risk and energy gain (Cezilly and Benhamou,
1996; Pyke, 1984; Pyke et al., 1977). For a correct decision in terms
of optimal foraging theory it is necessary that the rat is aware of its
location and able to estimate travel time. Therefore, navigational
skills have been investigated with the food-carrying task as well,
including sensory hierarchy and cue competition during piloting
and dead reckoning (Gibson and Shettleworth, 2003; Maaswinkel
and Whishaw, 1999; Tigner and Wallace, 1972; Whishaw and
Tomie, 1997). We have used the spontaneous alternation test to
obtain a crude measure of spatial working memory. Spontaneous
alternation was reduced after ACAo, but not after sham operation. However, alternation behavior depends not only on spatial
working memory, but also on the animal’s willingness to explore
a novel environment (Hughes, 2004; Lalonde, 2002). Our results
from elevated plus maze testing had demonstrated that anxiety
had decreased after ET-1 injection, while exploratory activity had
increased (see above). We can therefore conclude that reduction
of spontaneous alternation to chance level after ACAo reﬂects a
decrease of spatial memory rather than neophobia. A loss of spatial memory may therefore have contributed to the decrease of
food-carrying after ACAo. However, the fact that distance between
food and cage had no signiﬁcant effect on the food-carrying decision in the ACAo-group even before ET1-injection suggests that this
contribution may be small.
An unexpected ﬁnding was that walking speed during foodcarrying decreased from 46 to 34 cm/s after ACAo, while walking
speed on the elevated plus maze increased from 16 to 23 cm/s
(open arms) or 22 cm/s (closed arms), respectively. This illustrates
one of the main ﬁndings of this study, namely that ACAo indeed
changes behavior, but not in a generalized fashion resulting in
either hypoactivity (apathy, passivity) or hyperactivity (agitation).
Rather, behavioral changes seem highly context-dependent. In the
food-carrying task, rats leave their home-cage voluntarily to forage, and run back to their refuge at high speed after they have
decided to carry their food. The motivation to carry and to move fast
may be anxiety, which functions to move the animal toward danger using appropriate risk assessment behavior (McNaughton and
Corr, 2004). After ACAo, this motivational factor may be reduced,
resulting in less food-carrying with lower walking speed. On the
elevated plus maze, however, there is no refuge and no food, so that
goal-directed behavior cannot develop. In the absence of a task, the
effects of ACAo shift toward hyperactivity, with the animal restlessly roaming the maze. In a similar fashion, a mixture of apathy
and agitation occurs in the majority of institutionalized dementia
patients (Buettner and Fitzsimmons, 2006), whereby a decrease of
gray matter density in the anterior cingulate cortex correlates with
the severity of both behavioral states (Bruen et al., 2008). In ACAo
patients (stroke or ruptured aneurysms) apathy predominates, but
agitation is observed as well (Kumral et al., 2002; Kang and Kim,
2008). That even severe abulia is highly context-dependent has
been impressively shown by the telephone effect (Fisher, 1983),
where mute patients can be tricked into animated talking by calling
them on the phone.
5. Conclusions
Taken together, our results show that stereotactic injection
of ET-1 induces vasoconstriction long enough to induce bilateral
ischemic infarction in the ACA territory in rats. ACAo in the early
chronic stage, i.e., 1 month after ET-1 injection, decreased foodcarrying behavior and walking speed in a foraging situation, which

290

can be explained by decreased anxiety. Spatial working memory decreased as well, but seemed to be less important for the
food-handling decision. While reduced activity during goaldirected behavior develops analog to executive impairments and
abulia in human ACAo patients, the same rats show increased
exploratory activity and restlessness in the absence of task-related
stimuli. We conclude that the rat ACAo model is not only suitable
to study the effects of ACA stroke with respect to functional deterioration and recovery, but also to investigate how stroke symptoms
are provoked or alleviated by environment and context.
