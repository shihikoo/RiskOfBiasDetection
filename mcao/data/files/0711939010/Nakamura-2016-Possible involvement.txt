Introduction

Central nervous system (CNS) microvascular pericytes have
been recognized as an indispensable component of the
neurovascular unit, because they form the blood–brain barrier (BBB) structurally, and play various important roles in
angiogenesis, regulation of the cerebral blood ﬂow, immune
responses and repair after brain injury. Dysfunction of pericytes results in the development and deterioration of a
variety of CNS diseases, including stroke and Alzheimer’s
disease (Armulik et al., 2011; Balabanov and Dore-Duffy, 1998;
del Zoppo, 2006; Kamouchi et al., 2011; Zlokovic, 2011).
Platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) is
required for the development of mesenchymal cells, including pericytes and smooth muscle cells. Because PDGF-B or
PDGFRβ deﬁcient mice show massive brain hemorrhage
perinatally due to the formation of microvascular aneurysm
via pericyte loss (Hellstrom et al., 2001; Lindahl et al., 1997),
PDGFRβ signaling is necessary for pericyte recruitment
toward endothelial tubes and for the subsequent vascular
and neural development. It has been demonstrated that
PDGFRβ is expressed predominantly in pericytes in the adult
brain (Arimura et al., 2012; Winkler et al., 2010) and is
recognized as a maker of pericyte (Armulik et al., 2011).
Although the expression of PDGFRβ is low in the intact
matured brain, it is gradually induced in pericytes in periinfarct areas over three days after the induction of brain
ischemia (Arimura et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2012) and in
pericyte-derived ﬁbroblast-like cells later than seven days
after brain ischemia (Makihara et al., 2015). PDGFRβ-positive
ﬁbroblast-like cells occupy the ischemic core ultimately.
Thus, the PDGFRβ signaling may participate in two pivotal
processes after brain ischemia: (1) the maintenance and
repair of the BBB (Shen et al., 2012) and (2) the scar formation
of infarct areas by inducing the proliferation and migration of
PDGFRβ-positive cells, which produce neurotrophic factors,
such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3, and
extracellular matrix proteins, such as ﬁbronectin and collagen type 1 (Arimura et al., 2012; Ishitsuka et al., 2012;
Makihara et al., 2015). Because it has been demonstrated that
these repair processes are attenuated in mice with heterozygous deﬁciency of PDGFRβ (Makihara et al., 2015), it is very
important to uncover how PDGFRβ is regulated in pericytes
and pericyte-derived ﬁbroblast-like cells after brain ischemia.
In the present study, we investigated the mechanisms
underlying the upregulation of PDGFRβ in pericytes after
brain ischemia. We found that basic ﬁbroblast growth factor
(bFGF) plays an important role in the upregulation of PDGFRβ

in cultured pericytes and in peri-infarct areas in mouse stroke
models. bFGF may function cooperatively with PDGF-BB via
the upregulation of PDGFRβ after brain ischemia.

2.1.
Regulation of PDGFRβ expression in cultured CNS
pericytes under ischemic conditions
Because we and others have demonstrated previously that
PDGFRβ is drastically upregulated in pericytes after brain
ischemia, we ﬁrst investigated whether components of
ischemic conditions, such as hypoxia and acidiﬁcation, upregulated the expression of PDGFRβ in cultured CNS pericytes.
Neither hypoxia at 1% O2 (Fig. 1A and B) nor extracellular
acidiﬁcation at pH 6.5 (Fig. 1C) for 24 h signiﬁcantly altered
the expression of PDGFRβ in the cultured pericytes.
Among several molecules involved with pericytes, we
focused on bFGF, one of the neuroprotective and angiogenic
molecules, since several studies suggested a possible association between bFGF and PDGF signaling in other cell types (Cao
et al., 2003; McKinnon et al., 1990; Nissen et al., 2007; Zhang
et al., 2009). We found that bFGF signiﬁcantly increased the
PDGFRβ expression at the protein level (Fig. 1D), while
SU5402, a selective inhibitor of FGF receptor (FGFR), abolished
the bFGF-induced upregulation of PDGFRβ (Fig. 1E). In this
context, we examined whether bFGF/FGFR1/PDGFRβ pathway
was speciﬁc in the pericytes. We found that brain endothelial
cells did not express mRNA of PDGFRβ at all, although they
expressed both bFGF and FGFR1 similarly to the pericytes
(Supplemental Fig. 1A and B). These results indicated that
bFGF and FGFR1 functioned as an upregulator of PDGFRβ
speciﬁcally in microvascular pericytes.

2.2.
Erk and Akt mediated the bFGF-induced PDGFRβ
upregulation in cultured CNS pericytes
We investigated the bFGF-mediated intracellular signals
leading to the PDGFRβ upregulation, taking particular note
of the downstream signaling pathways of FGFR, Ras/Raf/
MAPK, PI3K/Akt and PLC, leading to proliferation, growth
arrest, differentiation or apoptosis (Dailey et al., 2005). Treatment with bFGF induced the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and
Akt, but not PLCγ1, in the pericytes (Fig. 2A, B and C). Both
U0126, an inhibitor of MEK, and LY294002, an inhibitor of
PI3K, completely abolished the bFGF-induced upregulation of
PDGFRβ (Fig. 2D).

2.4.
Temporal and spatial expression of bFGF after brain
ischemia

We next examined whether components of ischemic conditions upregulated the bFGF expression in pericytes using
cultured cells. Extracellular acidiﬁcation at pH 6.5 signiﬁcantly
upregulated bFGF mRNA in a time-dependent manner
(Fig. 3A), whereas neither hypoxia at 1% O2 (Fig. 3B) nor
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (Fig. 3C) increased the expression of
bFGF. On the other hand, hypoxia at 1% O2 upregulated the
expression of FGFR1 mRNA (Fig. 3E), whereas neither acidiﬁcation (Fig. 3D) nor H2O2 (Fig. 3F) increased the expression
of FGFR1.

We further examined the expression proﬁles of bFGF and
FGFR1 in C57BL/6 mice after brain ischemia. At day 1 after
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), the
expression level of bFGF mRNA was drastically increased in
the ischemic hemisphere, but not in the non-ischemic hemisphere (Fig. 4A). Immunoﬂuorescent double labeling revealed
that bFGF was co-localized with PDGFRβ-positive pericytes,
lectin-positive endothelial cells, and NeuN-positive neurons,
but not with glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive
astrocytes, at this early phase of ischemia (Fig. 4B). The

brain research 1630 (2016) 98–108

bFGF-positive microvessels themselves expressed the receptor FGFR1 (Supplemental Fig. 2A). In cultured cells, the
expression levels of bFGF and FGFR1 were considerably
higher in pericytes than in endothelial cells and NGFtreated PC12 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2B).
At day 4 after pMCAO, the expression of bFGF and FGFR1
was drastically increased in peri-infarct areas (Fig. 4C). Both
bFGF and FGFR1 were co-localized with PDGFRβ-positive
pericytes, which were also increased in peri-infarct areas
(Fig. 4D). These results suggested that bFGF, produced by
pericytes, endothelial cells, and neurons early after brain
ischemia, could act to FGFR1 expressed on pericytes in periinfarct areas after brain ischemia.
In an ischemia–reperfusion stroke model with transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), the upregulation of
bFGF was also observed in the ischemic hemisphere at day
1 after brain ischemia (Supplemental Fig. 2C). We also
demonstrated that the expression of FGFR1 and PDGFRβ
was signiﬁcantly increased in the ischemic hemisphere at
day 1 after tMCAO (Supplemental Fig. 2D and E); however, the
extent of increases in FGFR1 and PDGFRβ was less sharply
altered than that in bFGF. This suggested that PDGFRβ tended
to increase gradually from day 1 to day 4.

We ﬁnally examined bFGF-induced cell functions in cultured
CNS pericytes. We investigated the effects of bFGF on the
proliferation of pericytes. The MTS assay demonstrated that
the treatment with 10 ng/ml of bFGF for 72 h signiﬁcantly
accelerated cell growth (Fig. 5A), whereas co-treatment with
SU5402 or Sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor highly speciﬁc
for PDGFRβ, completely inhibited the bFGF-induced cell
growth. Treatment with Sunitinib alone inhibited the cell
growth at 72 h. These results indicated that PDGFR signaling
predominantly mediated the proliferation of pericytes.
We also evaluated the effect of bFGF on the PDGF-BBinduced cell migration of pericytes. Pericytes pre-incubated
with bFGF showed a signiﬁcant increase in PDGF-BB-induced
migratory activity, while SU5402 abolished the bFGFenhanced cell migration. Similarly, the elimination of PDGFBB from the culture media or the pre-treatment of Sunitinib
completely abolished the cell migration (Fig. 5B). There was
no signiﬁcant difference in the migration activity between
pericytes pre-incubated with bFGF and Sunitinib and with
Sunitinib alone (Supplemental Fig. 3).

and (4) pre-treatment with bFGF enhanced the proliferation

inhibitor of FGFR or PDGFRβ completely abolished these
actions of the pericytes.

3.1.
bFGF upregulates the expression of PDGFRβ in CNS
pericytes
The expression of PDGFRβ in infarct areas is a key event
affecting the repair process after brain ischemia. It is therefore important to uncover how PDGFRβ expression is

regulated after brain ischemia. We ﬁrst demonstrated using
cultured CNS pericytes that the expression of PDGFRβ is not
regulated in pericytes directly by components of ischemic
conditions, such as hypoxia and acidiﬁcation, although it
appears to be upregulated by bFGF. A previous study reported
that bFGF triggers PDGFRβ expression at the transcriptional
level, using bovine capillary endothelial cells transfected with
PDGFR promoter (Nissen et al., 2007). However, little has been
known about the bFGF/FGFR1/PDGFRβ pathway in intact CNS
pericytes. Because PDGFRβ was not expressed in brain
endothelial cells even though they express bFGF and FGFR1,
we consider that the bFGF/FGFR1/PDGFRβ pathway may be a

signaling speciﬁc for pericytes. We also consider that known
cooperative functions of bFGF and PDGF-BB in cell migration,
proliferation, and angiogenesis (Cao et al., 2003; Nissen et al.,
2007) may be mediated by the bFGF/FGFR1/PDGFRβ pathway
as discussed below.
The temporal and spatial expression proﬁles of bFGF, FGFR1
and PDGFRβ in vivo showed that (1) the expression of bFGF is
induced from several types of cells, including pericytes, early
after ischemia, (2) the expression of PDGFRβ is induced not
immediately but gradually after brain ischemia (Arimura et al.,
2012; Makihara et al., 2015; Nakamura et al., 2012) and (3) bFGF
and FGFR1 are co-localized with PDGFRβ in peri-infarct areas in
this period. These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that bFGF

upregulates the PDGFRβ expression in pericytes in peri-infarct
areas after brain ischemia. The ﬁndings that components of
ischemic conditions do not directly upregulate PDGFRβ and
that bFGF upregulates the expression of PDGFRβ may be
consistent well with the gradual upregulation of PDGFRβ. The
increased bFGF produced from pericytes, endothelial cells, and
neuron may act to FGFR1 expressed in pericytes in an autocrine/paracrine manner to upregulate the PDGFRβ expression.

cell count. The cell suspension was placed in the upper chamber with/without bFGF, SU5402 and Sunitinib. PDGF-BB (10 ng/
ml) was added to the lower chamber. After 24 h of incubation, migratory cells were stained, observed with a light microscope

is increased in neurons, astrocytes, macrophages and
endothelial cells in the ischemic hemisphere (Issa et al.,
2005). Our data clearly demonstrated that pericytes strongly
express bFGF and FGFR1 in peri-infarct areas early after
ischemic insult. Although there have been few studies
demonstrating the bFGF expression in pericytes thus far,
our observation is plausible because pericytes are mesenchymal lineage cells that are capable of trans-differentiating
into ﬁbroblasts, which produce and respond to bFGF.
Our results showed that acidiﬁcation is one of the triggers
for the upregulation of the expression of bFGF in cultured
CNS pericytes. The ﬁnding that the upregulation of bFGF
occurs early after brain ischemia in vivo may be consistent
with the concept that ischemia-related components directly
upregulate the expression of bFGF, in contrast to PDGFRβ.
Acidiﬁcation activates several transcription factors, such as

cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) via Ca2þ
signaling in cerebral microvascular pericytes, as we demonstrated previously (Nakamura et al., 2012). Another study also
reported that acidiﬁcation enhances vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and bFGF expression in bovine aortic
endothelial cells (D'Arcangelo et al., 2000). Although we were
unable to identify the speciﬁc transcription factor, acidiﬁcation could activate some transcriptional factors leading to the
expression of bFGF.

Greenberg, 1995), and plays a crucial role in the maturation
and stabilization of blood vessels (Baffour et al., 1992). Recent
reports show that bFGF and PDGF-BB act synergistically to
promote neovascularization (Cao et al., 2003; Nissen et al.,
2007) and stabilize the newly formed vasculature (Zhang
et al., 2009). In addition, bFGF plays various beneﬁcial roles
in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In experimental animal stroke models, the exogenous application of
bFGF attenuates neurological damage and improves tissue
repair (Koketsu et al., 1994; Sugimori et al., 2001; Watanabe
et al., 2004). Chen demonstrated that bFGF produced by
neurons might contribute to angiogenesis in the infarct brain
(Chen et al., 1994; Liu and Chen, 1994).
On the other hand, PDGFRβ signaling mediates various
functions of pericytes after brain ischemia, such as the
maintenance of the BBB and repair of infarct areas via
pericyte growth and migration, leading to neuroprotection
and angiogenesis (Arimura et al., 2012; Makihara et al., 2015;
Nakamura et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2012). In this study, we
demonstrated that bFGF regulates the expression of PDGFRβ
in pericytes. In addition, bFGF enhanced cell growth and the
PDGF-induced migration of pericytes, while speciﬁc inhibitors
for FGFR or PDGFR completely suppressed the bFGF-mediated
effects on pericytes. Collectively, bFGF may function cooperatively with PDGF-BB in part through the upregulation of
PDGFRβ, leading to the cell proliferation and migration in
CNS pericytes. Since PDGF-BB was induced in endothelial
cells in response to hypoxia (Arimura et al., 2012), PDGFRβpositive cells affected by bFGF might migrate toward the
impaired vasculature after brain ischemia.

3.4.

Conclusion

Basic FGF is upregulated in pericytes in response to acidiﬁcation in vitro and in peri-infarct areas early after ischemic
stroke in vivo, and may upregulate the expression of PDGFRβ
in pericytes in an autocrine/paracrine manner. bFGF may
activate pericytes functions via the interaction with PDGF-BB
through the upregulation of PDGFRβ in CNS pericytes, which
might contribute to neuroprotective and angiogenic actions.

Experimental procedure

4.1.

Cell culture

105

Human CNS pericytes, initiated from normal brain cortical
tissues, were purchased from ScienCell Research Laboratories. The cells were cultured using a Pericyte Medium
(ScienCell), which contains amino acids, vitamins, organic
and inorganic compounds, hormones, growth factors (containing 20 pg/ml of bFGF), trace minerals and a low concentration of fetal bovine serum (FBS, 2%), at 37 1C in 5% CO2 in a
humidiﬁed incubator. Cells subcultured four to eight times
were used for the present experiments. For the experimental
acidiﬁcation, we lowered the pH of the medium to 6.5, as
noted in the previous report (Nakamura et al., 2008;
Nakamura et al., 2012).
Human CNS microvascular endothelial cells (Cell Systems)
were cultured with the CS-C complete medium kit (Cell
Systems), as previously described (Ishitsuka et al., 2012). Rat
pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, used as neuronal cell model,
were cultured with the RPMI1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). It is well established that the
addition of NGF differentiates PC12 cells into neuronal cells
(Fujita et al., 1989).

4.2.
Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and real time PCR
Total RNAs from the cultured cells or cerebral cortex in the
mouse focal brain ischemia model were prepared using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was reverse transcribed with the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (Takara). Using
the product as a template, PCR was performed with primers
speciﬁc for the target genes (Sigma-Aldrich, Table 1). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System. The RT products were
ampliﬁed in a reaction mixture (20 ml) containing 10 ml of
SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara) and 0.4 mmol/l of each primer.
The copy numbers of the mRNAs were standardized to those
of 18s RNA.

4.3.

Immunoblot analysis

The cultured pericytes were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer
(50 mmol/l Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/l NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 5 mmol/l EDTA, 10 mmol/l
sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1 mmol/l sodium orthovanadate,
1 mmol/l NaF and protease inhibitors cocktail) at 4 1C and
centrifuged at 14,000g for 10 min. The protein concentration
was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). The
lysates, with an electrophoresis sample buffer, were boiled
for 5 min, subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE (10 μg/lane) and transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were
incubated for 1 h with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque) at room
temperature, probed with the primary antibody overnight at
4 1C, washed and incubated with the secondary antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology; CST) for 1 h at room temperature. The
blots were developed using an ECL Prime Western blotting
detection kit (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s

106

brain research 1630 (2016) 98–108

instructions. The expression levels of the proteins were
standardized to that of β-actin. Primary antibodies speciﬁc
for PDGFRβ (# 3169), Erk1/2 (# 4695, # 4370), Akt (# 4691, # 4060)
and PLCγ1 (# 5690, # 2821) were purchased from CST. Anti-βactin antibody (# A5441) was purchased from Sigma.

4.4.

Mouse focal brain ischemia model

The Animal Care and Use Review Committee of Kyushu
University approved all animal procedures. Male S129 mice
and C57BL/6J mice (8-9 weeks old, body weight 25–30 g) were
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.
We induced permanent focal brain ischemia via photochemical occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery (MCA),
as described previously (pMCAO) (Sugimori et al., 2004; Yao
et al., 2003). Brieﬂy, the mice were anesthetized with
halothane (2% for induction and 0.8–1% for maintenance) in
a mixture of 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen. We maintained the temporal muscle temperature at 36.070.3 1C using
a heat lamp and measured the cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF)
before and during ischemia with laser Doppler ﬂowmetry at
the ipsilateral bone (  1–2 mm posterior to the bregma). A
catheter was inserted into the superior vena cava through the
hole in the right jugular vein. Then, the temporal muscle was
retracted, until the distal part of the right MCA was observed
through the skull. A diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) laser,
operating at 561 nm and 6 mW, was used to irradiate the
MCA. The laser beam was positioned with a mirror and
focused with a convex lens (Newport KPX082AR.14) onto the
MCA. The photosensitizing dye, Rose Bengal (Wako), was
administered intravenously at a dose of 20 mg/kg over 90 s
simultaneously with 3 min of laser irradiation. The laser
beam was refocused on the MCA just proximal to the ﬁrst
spot, and another 3 min of irradiation was performed. The
right common carotid artery was ligated with a 6-0 silk suture
after conﬁrming that the CBF was less than 30% of the preocclusion level.
We also produced focal brain ischemia via the ischemia–
reperfusion transient occlusion of the right MCA (tMCAO), as
described previously (Shichita et al., 2009). After ligation of
the right common carotid artery (CCA), the right MCA was
occluded with a 6-0 silicon-coated monoﬁlament suture
(Doccol Corporation, # 602312), and the ﬁlament was inserted
from the right CCA. The distance from the suture tip to the
right CCA bifurcation was approximately 9 mm. Sixty minutes after brain ischemia, we withdrew the ﬁlament to allow
for reperfusion of the right MCA territory.

4.5.

Immunoﬂuorescence

One day or four days after focal brain ischemia, the mice were
deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with ice-cold saline and 4% formaldehyde (Wako).
The brains were quickly removed, cut into 2 mm thick
coronal sections and ﬁxed with 4% formaldehyde. The sections were embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT)
compound and cut into 20 μm thick slices. The sections were
then blocked with PBS containing 5% normal goat serum for
1 h at room temperature. Next, the sections were incubated
with primary antibodies [bFGF (Abcam # 16828, 1:20 dilution),

FGFR1 (Abcam # 829, 1:100 dilution), PDGFRβ (CST # 3169, 1:50
dilution), NeuN (Millipore # MAB377, 1:250 dilution), GFAP
(CST # 3670, 1:50)] overnight at 4 1C, followed by the secondary antibodies (afﬁnity-puriﬁed anti-rabbit or mouse immunoglobulin G; Nichirei Corporation, Japan) for 30 min at room
temperature. We also used ﬂuorescein 50 -isothiocynate (FITC)
conjugated-Tomato lectin (Vector Laboratories # FL-1171,
1:100) to label vascular endothelium overnight at 4 1C. The
slides were observed using the Z-stack function (2 μm intervals) on a BIOREVO BZ-9000 ﬂuorescence microscope (Keyence, Japan).

4.6.

Assay for cell proliferation

We performed a cell proliferation assay using the CellTiter 96s
Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega),
containing a tetrazolium compound [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS)], according to manufacturer’s instructions and previously described method (Kuroda et al., 2014).
Brieﬂy, 5  103/well of human CNS pericytes were seeded onto
a poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well plate. Following incubation for
the experiment, 20 μl of the reagent was added to each well of
the assay plate containing the cells in 100 μl of the culture
medium. The plate was then incubated for 3 h in a humidiﬁed,
5% CO2 atmosphere, and the absorbance was recorded at
490 nm using the microplate reader. Background absorbance
was corrected by subtracting the absorbance of a reference
wavelength at 650 nm.

4.7.

Assay for migration

Cell migration was evaluated using the CytoSelect Cell
Migration Assay Kit (Cell Biolabs), utilizing polycarbonate
membrane inserts (8 μm pore size). Brieﬂy, human CNS
pericytes were serum-starved overnight, treated with bFGF
with or without SU5402 (10 μmol/l) or Sunitinib (10 μmol/l) for
24 h and trypsinized for the cell count. A total of 3  105/well
of pericytes in medium were placed in the upper chamber
with/without bFGF, SU5402 and Sunitinib. PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml)
was added in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. After
24 h of incubation, non-migratory cells were removed, and
the migratory cells were stained with the attached stain
solution. The migratory cells were observed with a light
microscope and quantiﬁed using the microplate reader at
OD 560 nm after extraction.

4.8.

Chemicals

bFGF, U0126, Sunitinib and LY294002 were purchased from
CST, SU5402 was purchased from Calbiochem, NGF was
purchased from Sigma and PDGF-BB and H2O2 were purchased from Wako. All other materials related to immunoblotting were purchased from Bio-Rad.
SU5402 is an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinase of
FGFR1 (IC50¼ 10-20 mmol/l) that acts by interacting with the
catalytic domain of FGFR1. Sunitinib, also known as SU11248,
is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor widely known to target
PDGFR (IC50¼ 2 nmol/l) and VEGFR-2 (80 nmol/l).
