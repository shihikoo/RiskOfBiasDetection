ORIGINAL ARTICLE

Social interaction plays a critical role in neurogenesis and
recovery after stroke
VR Venna1, Y Xu1, SJ Doran1, A Patrizz1 and LD McCullough1,2,3
Stroke survivors often experience social isolation. Social interaction improves quality of life and decreases mortality after stroke.
Male mice (20–25 g; C57BL/6N), all initially pair housed, were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Mice were
subsequently assigned into one of three housing conditions: (1) Isolated (SI); (2) Paired with their original cage mate who was also
subjected to stroke (stroke partner (PH-SP)); or (3) Paired with their original cage mate who underwent sham surgery (healthy
partner (PH-HP)). Infarct analysis was performed 72 h after stroke and chronic survival was assessed at day 30. Immediate poststroke isolation led to a signiﬁcant increase in infarct size and mortality. Interestingly, mice paired with a healthy partner had
signiﬁcantly lower mortality than mice paired with a stroke partner, despite equivalent infarct damage. To control for changes in
infarct size induced by immediate post-stroke isolation, additional cohorts were assessed that remained pair housed for three days
after stroke prior to randomization. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were assessed at 90 days and cell
proliferation (in cohorts injected with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine, BrdU) was evaluated at 8 and 90 days after stroke. All mice in the
delayed housing protocol had equivalent infarct volumes (SI, PH-HP and PH-SP). Mice paired with a healthy partner showed
enhanced behavioral recovery compared with either isolated mice or mice paired with a stroke partner. Behavioral improvements
paralleled changes in BDNF levels and neurogenesis. These ﬁndings suggest that the social environment has an important role in
recovery after ischemic brain injury.

INTRODUCTION
It is increasingly accepted that social interactions are critical
for maintaining physical, mental and social well-being. Social
isolation has been associated with increased blood pressure,
elevated cortisol levels,1 enhanced inﬂammatory and metabolic
responses to stress,2,3 and modiﬁcations in transcriptional
pathways linked with glucocorticoid and inﬂammatory
signaling.4–7 Compared with individuals with social cohesion,
isolated individuals have enhanced susceptibility for the development of cardiovascular disorders,8 infectious diseases,9 cognitive decline10 and increased risk of cerebrovascular disorders
including ischemic stroke.11 Stroke is now the fourth leading
cause of death in the United States.12 Stroke-related mortality
has dropped over the past 10 years, primarily due to improvements in medical care and acute stroke treatment, but this has not
been accompanied by a decrease in the incidence of ischemic
stroke. This is alarming, as stroke is the leading cause of
chronic disability in adults, and increases in the number of stroke
survivors will further escalate health care costs over the next
several decades as our population ages.12,13 Therefore, any
potential opportunity to reduce stroke-related disability and
improve functional outcome would have tremendous public
health impact.
Data from the US census show an increase in the number of
people living alone since 1980s; a trend that is expected to

continue.14 Individuals who report lack of social support or
isolation have an increased incidence of recurrent stroke, poorer
recovery, greater functional decline and higher mortality following
a stroke compared with individuals with strong social
support.15–18 As not all strokes can be prevented, more attention
is needed to develop strategies to improve function after a stroke
has occurred.
Attesting to the importance of social factors in stroke outcome
is that these same effects can be reproducibly demonstrated in
animals; social interaction has been shown to reduce histological
damage from experimental stroke, whereas pre-stroke social
isolation (SI) enhances injury.7,19,20 To date, previous studies have
focused on isolation prior to, or at the time of, induction of
injury.21,22 However, as most patients are not identiﬁed as
‘isolated’ until after their stroke, the examination of the effects
of post-stroke isolation is important. In addition, as isolation
increases infarct size, prior studies have been confounded by the
larger infarcts seen in isolated animals. We hypothesized that
social interaction will enhance functional recovery independently
of infarct size and that the partner’s health status might have a
role. To test this hypothesis, we utilized a novel delayed poststroke housing paradigm to normalize infarct size between
groups. The effect of post-stroke environmental manipulation on
histological outcomes, IL-6 levels, chronic behavioral recovery and
neurogenesis was assessed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental animals
Six-week-old C57Bl/6 mice weighing 20–22 g were purchased from Charles
River laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA) and allowed to acclimate in
groups of four for two weeks prior to any housing manipulation. All mice
were maintained in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium, with
ad libitum access to food and water.

with 100 μl of saline subcutaneously for 5 days after surgery. This prevents
weight loss and reduces mortality, both stroke and sham mice were
administered injections to control for any potential stress of handling or
repeated injection. Quantiﬁcation of infarct volume and all behavioral tests
were performed and recorded by an investigator blinded to housing
conditions. All behavior tests were performed between 0800 and 1100 h,
immediately at the beginning of the light cycle after acclimatizing mice to
the testing room lighting conditions. Testing chambers were cleaned with
70% ethanol between mice.

Housing conditions and experimental design
All experimental animals were screened for baseline locomotor activity in
the open ﬁeld. Mice were housed in standard mouse cages (11"L, 6"W, 6"H)
with a 12-h light/dark schedule (lights on at 0700 h). Body weights were
recorded and mice were pair housed (all mice were housed two per cage
with an original cage mate) for 2 weeks before subjecting them to right
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham surgery. Animals were
then randomly assigned to one of the three housing conditions—either
housed isolated (SI), pair housed with a stroke partner (PH-SP) or pair
housed with a healthy partner (PH-HP) either immediately after stroke
(cohort-1) or three days after MCAO (cohort-2). In the ﬁrst cohort, two
endpoints were assessed; a three-day survival group was used for
neurological deﬁcit scores (NDS), infarct analysis and changes in serum
interleukin-6 levels; a 30-day survival group that was used to assess
mortality rates (see Figure 1a). A second cohort (cohort-2) was used to
study delayed post-stroke housing effects with two different endpoints at
8 and 90 days. Animals were tested in the cylinder, corner and on the tail
suspension test (TST) (see Figure 2a for timeline of behavioral testing) and
sacriﬁced at day 90, for BDNF analysis. In the 8-day endpoint, mice were
injected with BrdU from day 3–7 and analysis was performed 24 h after the
last injection (day 8), an additional sub-group of mice was allowed to
survive for 90 days to conﬁrm neuronal maturation.
All animals were given wet mash for the initial 72 h after stroke or sham
surgery. As mortality is higher when chronic endpoints are assessed, all
animals that had planned survival endpoints over 3 days were injected

Exclusion criteria
If any mouse did not gain at least one gram of weight during the 2 weeks
of pre-stroke pair housing, lost weight during the two weeks of PH, or
exhibited signs of ﬁght wounds due to dominant/aggressive behavior of
the partner, both mice were excluded from the study as social aversion/
stress can also inﬂuence stroke outcome.4,23,24 If one mouse of the pair
dies at any point during the experiment, that pair is excluded from
further study.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion model
Focal transient cerebral ischemia was induced by right MCAO followed by
reperfusion as described previously.7 Core body temperature was
monitored with a rectal probe connected to a temperature control system
(Fine science tools, North Vancouver, BC, Canada). Temperature was
maintained with an automatic heating pad at ∼37 °C during surgery and
ischemia. Cerebral blood ﬂow measurements by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry
conﬁrmed ischemia during MCAO (to o80% of baseline) and restoration
of ﬂow during reperfusion in all cohorts.

Infarct analysis
Following 72 h of reperfusion, all animals in cohort 1 were euthanized by
pentobarbital overdose, brains were removed and cut into ﬁve 2-mm

scores prior to sacriﬁce showed a lack of recovery in SI cohort relative to intra-ischemic score, while both pair-housed groups recovered
signiﬁcantly (there were no signiﬁcant differences between PH-SP and PH-HP groups); Friedman’s test was used for analysis, *Po0.05; n = 10

coronal sections and stained with 1.5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) for 8 min at 38 °C. Slices were formalin-ﬁxed (4%) and then digitalized
and infarct volumes analyzed (Sigma Scan Pro, San Jose, CA, USA) as
previously described.7 The ﬁnal infarct volumes are presented as a
percentage (percentage of contralateral structures with correction for
edema) as in Venna et al.7 For histology and immunohistochemistry, brains
were collected from additional chronic survival cohorts. Animals were
deeply anesthetized and perfused transcardially with ice-cold sodium
phosphate-buffered saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose.

Corner test
Following the cylinder test animals were tested in the corner test as
described in (Venna et al.26). The mouse was placed between two pieces of
cardboard, each with a dimension of 30 × 20 × 1 cm. The two boards were
gradually moved to enclose the mouse from both sides to encourage the
mouse to enter into a corner of 30° angle. After vibrissae stimulation, the
mouse rears forward and upward, then turns back to face the opening.
Twenty trials were performed for each mouse and the percentage of right
turns was calculated.

Open ﬁeld
Neurological deﬁcit scores
Neurological deﬁcit scores were obtained in the intra-ischemic period and
at 72 h post-stroke in short-term survival cohort-1. The scoring system was
as follows: 0, no deﬁcit; 1, forelimb weakness and torso turning to one side
when held by tail; 2, circling to affected side; 3, unable to bear weight on
affected side and circling immediately when placed on a bench; and 4, no
spontaneous locomotor activity or barrel rolling as described previously as
in Venna et al.7

IL-6 ELISA
Serum was collected from the mice sacriﬁced at 72 h post-stroke in mice
subjected to the three housing conditions (SI, PH-SP or PH-HP)
immediately after stroke. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were examined utilizing
an enzyme-linked immune absorbent (ELISA) assay (eBiosciences, San
Diego, CA, USA) per manufacturer’s instructions.

Mice were placed in an open ﬁeld chamber (15" × 15") equipped with 16
infrared beam emitting LEDs. The total number of beam breaks were
automatically registered by a computer-operated PAS Open Field system
(San Diego Instruments, San Diego, CA, USA). The total number of beam
breaks during a 20 min session was analyzed as a measure of spontaneous
locomotor activity.

Tail suspension test
Animals were returned to their home cages after open ﬁeld analysis and
allowed free access to food and water at least for 30 min before testing
them in TST. TST was performed as in Venna et al.26 Mice were suspended
horizontally by the tail to a metal bar using adhesive scotch tape for a total
duration of 6 min. The test was analyzed and the times of active escape
behavior (mobility) versus passive behavior with no limb or head
movements (immobility) was recorded. Latency to ﬁrst immobile period
was also quantiﬁed27 and is reported as latency. Behavior was scored
manually by an experienced rater blinded to housing condition.

Cylinder test

BrdU Treatment

The cylinder test was used to assess forelimb use after stroke. The mouse
was placed in a transparent Plexiglas cylinder 9-cm diameter and 15 cm in
height. A mirror was placed behind the cylinder with an angle to enable
the rater to record forelimb movements when the mouse was turned away
from the rater. A total of 20 forelimb placements were counted for analysis
as previously described.7,25

Separate cohorts of mice were injected intraperitoneally with 75 mg
kg − 1per day of BrdU once daily during days 3–7 after stroke.28 BrdU
(Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) was dissolved in 0.007 N NaOH in 0.9% NaCl.
Mice were either sacriﬁced on day 8 or on day 90 (n = 4) to conﬁrm
neuronal maturation. BrdU+ cell counts were performed on stained
sections from perfused brains29,30 (n = 8 per group) as detailed below.

Immunoﬂuorescence
Brains were cut in 30 micron sections and mounted on superfrost plus
slides (Fisher scientiﬁc, Pittsburg, PA, USA), then subjected to microwave
irradiation for 5 min in 0.1 M, pH 6 citrate buffer solution followed by
incubation in blocking solution.7 Sections were incubated overnight with
rat anti-BrdU (1:100, AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC, USA) and mouse Anti-NeuN
(1:200, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to conﬁrm neuronal lineage. Sections
were subjected to three ﬁve-minute washes with PBS and then incubated
for 60 min with ﬂuorescein-conjugated anti-mouse and rhodamineconjugated anti-rat secondary antibodies (Alexaﬂuor, Grand Island, NY).
Then brain sections were washed, then dipped in DAPI solution (1:1000) for
ﬁve minutes and cover slipped. Sections were visualized under an inverted
light Zeiss axiovert ﬂuorescence microscope.7 Newborn cells were
identiﬁed by co-labeling with BrdU+ cells and DAPI. To perform
quantiﬁcation of BrdU+ cells, four coronal brain slices per animal (n = 8
animals per group) were stained from ~1.1 mm bregma, 0.8 mm bregma,
0.5 mm bregma and −0.1 mm bregma. Two 20 × ﬁelds per section were
analyzed on the infarct side. BrdU+ cells were counted using MacBiophotonics ImageJ software (Hamilton, ON, Canada). The total numbers of cells
per ﬁeld of view were counted by a blinded investigator and the average
number of cells per ﬁeld was used for statistical analysis.29,30

Western blot
Brains were rapidly extracted; hippocampi were isolated from brains and
were immediately ﬂash frozen. The protein concentration was determined
by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc., Rockford, lL, USA) to
achieve equal loading of 10 μg per well.7 Sample proteins were resolved
on SDS electrophoresis gels and transferred to a polyvinylidene diﬂouride
membrane. All blots were blocked with 5% milk and incubated overnight
with BDNF (1:200; Millipore) and actin (1:5000; Sigma-loading control) at 4 °
C in TBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween. Secondary
antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG 1:5000 for BDNF, anti-mouse 1:1000 for
actin) were diluted, and ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences,
Buckinghamshire, UK) was used for signal detection. Densitometry was
performed (Adobe). Data is presented as ratio to actin normalized to SI.

Statistics
Data were expressed as mean ± s.e.m. except for NDS, which was
presented as median (interquartile range). Statistics were performed using
SPSS version PASW17. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for analysis
involving more than two independent groups, Bonferroni post hoc for
multiple comparisons, repeated measures for cylinder and corner tests, a Ztest for proportions was used to analyze survival rates and the Friedman
test with Bonferroni correction used for repeated measures ordinal data (i.
e., NDS). A probability value, Po0.05 was considered to be statistically

RESULTS
Infarct analysis
To examine whether post-stroke housing manipulation inﬂuences
stroke outcome, all mice were initially pair housed for two weeks
prior to a 60-min MCAO and assigned to one of the three
‘immediate post-stroke’ housing conditions: (1) Housed in a cage
individually (SI), (2) paired with its original partner also subjected
to stroke surgery (PH-SP) (3) paired with its original partner (not
subjected to stroke) (PH-HP) (Figure 1a). Regardless of the
partner’s health condition, pair-housed mice had signiﬁcantly
smaller infarcts 72 h after stroke compared with SI cohorts in the
cortex F(2,26) = 5.12, Po 0.05; striatum F(2,26) = 7.24, Po 0.01 and
in the total hemisphere F(2,26) = 13.03, P o0.01. No signiﬁcant
differences were seen in infarct volumes between PH-HP and PHSP cohorts; the mean difference (MD) in cortex = 4.3, P = 0.644; MD
striatum = 0.344, P = 0.997 and MD total = 1.56, P = 0.93 (Figure 1c).
Neurological deﬁcit scores and serum IL-6 levels
The detrimental effects of SI were also reﬂected in the NDS,
Friedman test for repeated measures revealed no recovery in SI
mice χ2(1) = 0.0001; P = 1.0, but a signiﬁcant recovery in both PHSP χ2(1) = 10, P = 0.002 and in PH-HP χ2(1) = 9; P = 0.003 (Figure 1d).
SI mice had signiﬁcantly elevated serum IL-6 compared with PH
cohorts after stroke F(2,15) = 16.38, P o 0.05. (Figure 1e), post hoc
tests revealed no signiﬁcant difference between PH-SP and PH-HP
groups; P>0.05. Sham mice has no signiﬁcant changes in serum
IL-6 levels F(2,13) = 0.64, P = 0.54. These results revealed a similar
pattern to that previously seen in mice exposed to pre-stroke SI
with isolated animals sustaining larger infarcts, an enhanced
inﬂammatory response and poorer functional recovery than
animals housed together.7,19,20
Exclusion and mortality rates
A total of 4% of original mouse pairs were excluded at the
beginning of the study due to partner aggression as per pre-set
exclusion criteria. In cohort-1 (immediate post-stroke isolation) SI
mice had signiﬁcantly higher mortality (61%) compared with PHSP (39%), P o 0.05. PH-HP mice had only a 17% mortality (P o0.01)
(Figure 3) at 30 days. These ﬁndings suggest that interactions with
a healthy partner might offer additional beneﬁt and improve poststroke survival. These effects appear to be independent of the
effects on acute infarct damage, which was equivalent between
the two cohorts of PH mice. Survival rates in cohort-2 (delayed
post-stroke isolation) were higher as post-stroke care was more
aggressive, but SI mice still had signiﬁcantly higher mortality
(20%) compared with PH-SP (10%); (Po 0.05), and in PH-HP (3%);
(P o 0.001).
Functional recovery is independent of infarct size and associated
with interactions and health of the partner
One possible explanation for the improved recovery in PH mice is
that infarct damage is less due to the acute neuroprotection
induced by immediate post-stroke housing. To investigate the
speciﬁcity of relationship between social interaction, partner’s
health and post-stroke recovery, we subjected mice to a ‘delayed
post-stroke’ housing paradigm (Figure 2a). As infarct damage is
complete in this stroke model by 24 h,31 we allowed the infarct to
mature prior to housing in an attempt to normalize infarct size
between groups. All mice were kept pair housed for 72 h
immediately after stroke. In this way, recovery can be separated
from the degree of histological damage, which will be equivalent

in all cohorts. Mice were then placed back with its previous
partner who was either a ‘healthy’ or ‘stroke’ mouse or maintained
in isolation (SI). Long-term recovery was assessed with both the
cylinder and corner test.25
Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that there were signiﬁcant
asymmetries (reduced contralateral forelimb use) in the cylinder
test in stroke cohorts compared with sham animals regardless of
housing condition. There was an overall signiﬁcant effect of
surgery F(1,44) = 309.09, P o 0.01 (Figure 2b), an overall signiﬁcant
effect of housing F(2,44) = 18.3, P o0.05. There was also signiﬁcant
surgery-by-housing interaction, F(2,44) = 18.83, P o 0.01 suggesting differences in recovery. Independent analyses at each time
point (days 3–28) revealed that these observed effects are due to
more rapid and complete forelimb motor recovery in PH-HP mice
compared with PH-SP; P o 0.05. SI mice had signiﬁcantly reduced
contralateral limb use compared with PH cohorts even at day 28
(*P o 0.01) (Figure 2b). Sham operated mice had no signiﬁcant
differences between groups. Figure 2c illustrates the results of
mean non-impaired side turn percentages using the corner test
that showed a consistent pattern of recovery. A signiﬁcant effect
of day-by-surgery F(1,44) = 53.73, P o 0.01 was seen, due to the
fact that there was an early reduction in turning preference in PHHP compared with PH-SP; SI mice had a continued turning
preference at day 29 compared with PH cohorts. There was also
signiﬁcant surgery F(1,44) = 321.22, P o0.05 and a housing F
(2,44) = 8.87; P o 0.01 for the entire testing period.
Long-term social isolation reduced mobility in tail suspension test
and reduced hippocampal BDNF levels
To explore the role of social interaction on depressive phenotypes,
mice were subjected to the ‘delayed post-stroke’ housing
paradigm detailed above (Figure 2a). When changes in mobility
using the TST were evaluated, there was a signiﬁcant difference
between groups F(3,32) = 18.8, P o0.01; Bonferroni post hoc
analysis revealed a signiﬁcantly reduced mobility in SI group

Functional recovery paralleled enhanced neurogenesis
Brains were analyzed for histological assessment at 8 days post
stroke, no signiﬁcant differences in infarct size between groups
was seen (Figure 5a). Equivalent behavioral deﬁcits were seen at
day 3 post stroke prior to housing randomization. Groups (SI vs
PH) signiﬁcantly diverged in their recovery by post-stroke day 7.
As ischemia is known to induce neurogenesis, which may be an
important factor in functional recovery,32,33 we assessed strokeinduced cell proliferation on day 8 after stroke in the

group had signiﬁcantly less mobility compared with PH-HP
(P = 0.04) (Figure 4a). When analyzed for latency to the ﬁrst bout
of immobility, there were signiﬁcant differences between groups F
(3,32) = 23.73, P o 0.01. Bonferroni post hoc analysis revealed
signiﬁcant differences in latencies between SI and PH-SP
(P = 0.02) and also a signiﬁcant difference between PH-HP

reduced the duration of immobility and prolonged the latency to
the ﬁrst bout of immobility compared with SI group (Figure 4b).
Independent analysis showed no differences between sham
groups, data are presented as pooled for sham groups
(Figure 4). Spontaneous locomotor analysis in open ﬁeld showed
no differences between groups F(3,32) = 0.98; P = 0.42, suggesting
that decreased mobility is not due to motor deﬁcits (Figure 4c).

signiﬁcant difference between stroke groups F(3,28) = 20.12,

signiﬁcant reduction of BDNF expression in SI compared with PHSP (P = 0.008) and PH-HP (P o0.001). BDNF levels in PH-HP were

DISCUSSION
This study has established that early post-stroke interactions can
reduce histological damage after ischemic challenge. These
ﬁndings are consistent with the beneﬁcial effects of pair housing
observed in pre-stroke isolation models, and suggest that this may
have important translational relevance for treatment of stroke
patients.21 More importantly, this work shows that pair housing,
even if delayed for days after stroke, leads to enhanced functional
recovery after injury, even in the absence of a signiﬁcant reduction

of histological damage. This novel ﬁnding suggests that there is
considerable brain plasticity and capacity for repair, even days
after injury, enhancing the translational signiﬁcance of this work.
Our results also demonstrate that housing stroke mice with a
healthy partner signiﬁcantly hastens functional recovery and
reduces mortality compared with mice housed with a stroke
partner, whereras isolated mice demonstrated the poorest
recovery. These effects parallel increased cell proliferation and
higher hippocampal BDNF levels.
In previous work, we have demonstrated that pre-stroke social
isolation is detrimental.7 However, as stroke is an unpredictable
event, manipulating social environments prior to an event in
patients at risk is likely to be ineffective from a therapeutic
standpoint. Therefore we initially wanted to determine if these
same manipulations performed after injury would have similar
effects at a time when patients would be presenting to medical
care. We found that immediate post-stroke pair housing
signiﬁcantly decreased infarct volume, and this was seen in
animals paired with either a healthy partner or a partner that also
had been subjected to stroke. We further hypothesized that
housing with a sick partner would reduce the beneﬁt of PH while a
healthy partner may further ameliorate beneﬁcial effects of PH.
When tested, no signiﬁcant differences were observed between
PH-HP and PH-SP in either the amount of histological injury or
serum IL-6 levels. We also found a similar improvement in
functional outcome, as measured by the NDS, regardless of the
health of the cage partner. This suggests that the detrimental
effects of acute isolation might also be due to pair dissociation/
separation effects.34 However, an unexpected and interesting
pattern emerged when these animals were followed for 30 days,
which was the pre-speciﬁed behavioral endpoint. Despite having
similar infarct sizes, mice housed with a healthy partner (PH-HP)
had signiﬁcantly higher survival rates than mice housed with a
partner that had also been subjected to stroke (PH-SP), although
both PH cohorts did better than the isolated cohort. This
suggested that there were unknown factors that enhanced
survival in mice paired with a healthy partner.
One limitation of the previously published reports examining
social factors and stroke is that all have utilized pre-stroke or
immediate post-stroke isolation which invariably leads to an
increased infarct size.7,19,20,22 Therefore any increase in inﬂammation, apoptosis or behavioral deﬁcits in isolated cohorts may
simply reﬂect the amount of ischemic injury. To address this and
examine the potential therapeutic window for environmental
manipulations, we waited 3 days to place mice in the speciﬁed
housing environment, as infarct is complete in this model by 72 h
after injury.31 This allowed us to control the size of the infarct
between the three groups, and may be a more realistic
‘therapeutic time window’ in which to treat an acute stroke
patient with environmental manipulations. Despite equivalent
histological damage in all groups, isolated mice continued to do
poorly, with delayed functional recovery and higher mortality.
Mice housed with a healthy partner had signiﬁcantly better
behavioral recovery than those housed with a stroke partner. This
suggests that there are factors that contribute to the detrimental
effects of isolation7,19,20 such as IL-6, NF-kappaB as well as
additional factors that underlie the beneﬁcial effects of afﬁliative
interactions such as grooming, whisker stimulation,35,36 which can
be further enhanced based on partner’s health. Although all mice
were screened and monitored for aggressive behavior towards the
partner and we excluded those dyads from the study, we cannot
completely rule out the possibility that stroke induced aggressive
behavioral changes by the healthy partner. We feel this is less
likely as stroke animals housed with a healthy partner actually did
much better both in terms of behavior and mortality than mice
housed with a stroke partner. In turn, stroke mice housed with
another stroke mouse had better outcomes than stroke mice that
were isolated. This suggests that housing was beneﬁcial compared

with isolation as the isolated mice are clearly not exposed to any
partner, aggressive or otherwise.
We hypothesized that the enhanced behavioral recovery seen
with PH was secondary to an enhancement in neurogenesis, as
has been described with environmental enrichment.37,38 Neurogenesis occurs throughout life in both rodents and humans.39,40
Cerebral ischemia increases cell proliferation in both the
subventricular zone and the hippocampus, and these newborn
cells can migrate into the infarcted area.30 Enhancements in
neurogenesis have been linked to improved functional recovery in
many studies,41 but how these cells integrate into the damaged
brain and the ultimate potential to enhance repair after stroke is
unknown. Both PH-HP and PH-SP mice demonstrated increased
cell proliferation rates, which paralleled changes in functional
recovery. BDNF is an important mediator of neuronal activity,
neurogenesis, brain repair, cell survival and synaptic structure
formation.38,41,42 Activation of BDNF and its receptor tropomyosinrelated kinase B (TrkB) enhanced neuronal plasticity and
neurogenesis after ischemic injury in mice.43 Recently it has been
shown that transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells reduced
social deﬁcits in social preference tests mainly by enhancing BDNF
levels.44 As we also found a reduction in depression-like behavior
in PH mice compared with isolated cohorts, and BDNF signaling
has also been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression,45
we examined BDNF levels, which were increased in PH animals
compared with SI and further enhanced in mice with a healthy
partner.
Over ~40% of stroke survivors suffer from depression, and this
may be exacerbated by isolation and feelings of loneliness.16,46
Many epidemiological studies have shown that depression is a risk
factor for stroke, and is associated with poorer recovery once a
stroke has occurred.47,48 The downstream mechanism by which
PH prevented depression-like behavior is not known, but likely
involves numerous pathways. Nibuya et al.49 showed that
antidepressant drugs increase the synthesis of BDNF.49 Traditional
antidepressants may act by enhancing BDNF signaling50,51 as
BDNF expression increased in depressed patients after
treatment.50,52 BDNF activation is essential for manifestation of
experience-dependent social aversion and mediating changes in
long-term neural and behavioral plasticity in response to social
aggression.23 Our work suggests that BDNF also has an important
role in the beneﬁcial effects of social interaction after injury.
Whether these same effects can be recapitulated with pharmacological treatments is not yet known.
In summary, this study provides the ﬁrst direct experimental
evidence to support a role of post-stroke social interaction in
stroke recovery independent of infarct damage. Our ﬁndings
emphasize that although pair housing is beneﬁcial to recovery, the
health of the partner is also an important contributing factor to
functional recovery. Given that these effects parallel the enhanced
cell proliferation and increased hippocampal BDNF levels, more
research is needed to understand how the beneﬁcial effects of
social interaction could be translated to clinical practice. Recent
results from trials designed to provide reciprocal peer support for
heart failure patients found that more than half of the participants
had no or minimal engagement with the program, and no
improvements in outcomes were seen.53 It is possible that social
support may be more effective when provided by a healthy
individual rather than a disease-affected peer. As a rehabilitative
strategy, efforts to encourage interactions among stroke survivors
and healthy society members could offer an important opportunity to reduce the substantial burden of stroke in our
communities.
