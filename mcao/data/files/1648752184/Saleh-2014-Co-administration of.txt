Abstract
The present study demonstrates the benefits of combinatorial antioxidant therapy in the treatment of ischemic stroke. Male
Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetised and the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded for 30 minutes followed by 5.5
hours of reperfusion. Pretreatment with resveratrol 30 minutes prior to MCA occlusion resulted in a significant, dosedependent decrease in infarct volume (p,0.05) compared to vehicle-treated animals. Neuroprotection was also observed
when resveratrol (261023 mg/kg; iv) was administered within 60 minutes following the return of blood flow (reperfusion).
Pretreatment with non-neuroprotective doses of resveratrol (261026 mg/kg) and lipoic acid (LA; 0.005 mg/kg) in
combination produced significant neuroprotection as well. This neuroprotection was also observed when resveratrol and LA
were administered 15 minutes following the onset of MCA occlusion. Subsequently, we synthetically combined resveratrol
and LA in both a 1:3 (UPEI-200) and 1:1 (UPEI-201) ratio, and screened these new chemical entities in both permanent and
transient ischemia models. UPEI-200 was ineffective, while UPEI-201 demonstrated significant, dose-dependent
neuroprotection. These results demonstrate that combining subthreshold doses of resveratrol and LA prior to ischemiareperfusion can provide significant neuroprotection likely resulting from concurrent effects on multiple pathways. The
additional protection observed in the novel compound UPEI 201 may present opportunities for addressing ischemiainduced damage in patients presenting with transient ischemic episodes.

peroxidation, protein synthesis arrest, and ultimately cell death
[3]. Successful treatment options are therefore required to address
several critical mediators of neuronal death simultaneously.
With the increasing popularity of natural products, science has
sought to exploit the medicinal potential of common extracts as is
evident in the growing literature of natural product drug
discovery. In the current study, we test 2 novel compounds
combining resveratrol (3, 5, 49-trihydroxystilbene), a naturallyoccurring component of grapes, and a-lipoic acid (LA), a potent
anti-oxidant found in common foods, for neuroprotective effects in
2 animal models of ischemic stroke. Separately, resveratrol and LA
possess potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and
have been shown to produce neuroprotection in several animal
models of neurological disease via complementary pathways [4]
[5].
Resveratrol possesses multiple biological activities [6] [7],
including being a potent antioxidant [8] and anti-inflammatory
[9] agent. These therapeutic uses of resveratrol have led
researchers to investigate its protective effects in several animal
models of neurological disease, particularly those with unknown

Introduction
Despite ongoing advances in the arena of stroke research, the
worldwide consequences of death and disability remain considerable and delivery of successful therapeutics continues to present a
challenge. The application of combinatorial drug therapy in
treating stroke has become increasingly attractive in recent years.
As researchers uncover the complexity of disease progression
following stroke which includes both immediate as well as delayed
neuronal effects at multiple levels [1], it has become evident that
multi-targeted drug therapy may hold more promise in the
treatment and/or prevention of stroke than conventional single
class drug regimens. In addition, there is evidence that some drug
combinations display pharmacological potentiation (ie synergism)
which optimistically translates into lower doses, fewer adverse side
effects and an extended treatment window. Treatment outcomes
for ischemic events involves the reestablishment of blood flow to
compromised tissue, with the reintroduction of oxygen transiently
adding to the injury due to generation of inflammatory mediators
and toxic levels of oxidative free radicals [2] culminating in lipid

role in the pathogenesis. Consequently, resveratrol has shown
promise as a neuroprotectant in animal models of cerebral
ischemia through its ability to attenuate ischemia-induced cell
death [10].

including models of reperfusion injury [12] [13] [14] [15] [16]
[17]. Further, the co-administration of LA with other compounds
has been shown to enhance the protective effect of the drug in
various animal models of pathology [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]. Our
own research has shown that co-administration of non-protective
(sub-threshold) doses of both LA and apocynin, an NADPH
oxidase inhibitor, provided significant neuroprotection against
ischemic injury [23].

Co-Administration of LA and Res in Neuroprotection

Thus, the current study investigated the potential for enhanced
neuroprotective effects with LA by combining it with resveratrol in
a rodent model of acute stroke and reperfusion injury [24]. In
addition, the effects of resveratrol and lipoic acid were compared
to UPEI-200 and UPEI-201, two novel synthetic compounds
linking resveratrol with LA in both a transient occlusionreperfusion model (tMCAO) as well as in a permanent occlusion
model (pMCAO). Lastly, the feasibility of delayed treatment
intervention was investigated for all drug combinations.

Methods
Ethics Statement
All experiments were carried out in accordance with the
guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care and were
approved by the University of Prince Edward Island Animal Care
Committee (protocol #11-045 and 13-036).

General Surgical Procedures for in vivo Studies
All experiments were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley rats
(250–350 g; Charles Rivers; Montreal, PQ, CAN). For all animals,
food and tap water were available ad libitum. Rats were
anaesthetized with sodium thiobutabarbital (Inactin; SigmaAldridge; St.Louis, MO, USA; 100 mg/kg; ip) and supplemented
as needed. For intravenous administration of drugs, a polyethylene
catheter (PE-10; Clay Adams, Parsippany, NJ, USA) was inserted
into the right femoral vein. An endotracheal tube was inserted to
facilitate breathing. Body temperature was monitored and
maintained at 3761uC using a feedback system (Physitemp
Instruments; Clifton, NJ, USA).
A separate group of animals were instrumented for the
recording of blood pressure and heart rate via an indwelling
catheter (PE-50; ; Clay Adams, Parsippany, NJ, USA) placed
inside the right femoral artery. Arterial blood pressure was
measured with a pressure transducer (Gould P23 ID, Cleveland,
OH) connected to a Gould model 2200S polygraph. Heart rate
was determined from the pulse pressure using a Gould tachograph
(Biotach). These parameters were displayed and analyzed using

Transient and Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery
Occlusions (tMCAO and pMCAO)
We have previously published the detailed methodology for
transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery [24]. Briefly,
animals were placed in a David Kopf stereotaxic frame (Tujunga,
CA, USA) and the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) approached
through a rostra-caudal incision of the skin and frontalis muscle at
the approximate level of bregma. Blood flow through the MCA
was impeded by the placement of surgical suture behind the MCA
at 3 designated positions along the exposed vessel for 30 minutes in
the transient model (tMCAO), or left in place for a total of 6 hours
in the permanent model (pMCAO). The sutures were positioned
such that the middle of each suture applied pressure to the
underside of the MCA and impeded blood flow (ischemia) as
previously confirmed using laser Doppler flowmetry (OxyFlo,
Oxford-Optronix, Oxford, UK) (Connell and Saleh 2010). This 3point placement of surgical sutures produced a highly reproducible
and consistent focal ischemic lesion restricted to the prefrontal
cerebral cortex. Blood flow in the tMCAO model was reestablished (reperfusion) for an additional 5.5 hours following
removal of the sutures.

at 0uC under nitrogen atmosphere, which is then stirred for 5 min
at 0uC and 3 h at 20uC. Precipitated urea is then filtered off and
the filtrate evaporated down in vacuo. The residue was taken up in
dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and, if necessary, filtered free of any
further precipitated urea. The solvent was removed by evaporation and the crude compound was purified by silica column
chromatography (Eluent, Hexanes:Ethylacetate (1:1; yellow oil),

(LA; Sigma-Aldridge; St. Louis, MO, USA; 0.005 mg/ml) was
prepared in physiological saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and the
pH was adjusted to 7.0–7.4 with sodium hydroxide. The
concentration of LA used was previously determined to be nonneuroprotective in our tMCAO model [12]. Appropriate vehicle
solutions were prepared for each drug and dose.

Effect of Resveratrol on tMCAO Model
In the first experiment, resveratrol (261023 (n = 5), 261024
(n = 5), 261025 (n = 6), 261026 (n = 5), 261027 (n = 5) mg/kg;
1 ml/kg; i.v.) or vehicle (propylene glycol; 461023% (v/v); 1 ml/
kg; i.v.; n = 5) was administered 30 minutes prior to the onset of
MCAO. The sutures were left in place for 30 minutes, followed by
5.5 hours of reperfusion.
The feasibility of extended treatment options was investigated
by administering the highest dose of resveratrol (261023 mg/kg;
i.v.) or vehicle (propylene glycol; 461023% (v/v); 1 ml/kg; i.v.) at
the following intervals during the I/R protocol; 15 minutes (n = 5/
group) following the onset of MCAO, and 0, 30, 60, 90 minutes
(n = 5,6,7,4 respectively) following the onset of reperfusion.

Synthesis of UPEI-200
The chemical synthesis of UPEI-200 was performed as follows;
resveratrol (0.01 M) was combined with 0.05 M LA and 0.04 M of
dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in 80 ml of anhydrous dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodimide hydrochloride (EDCI; 0.05 M) was added in small quantities
over a period of 2 hours. The entire reaction was performed under
nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. After stirring overnight, the crude mixture of compounds was quickly purified by
passing through a silica column following an aqueous work up.
The product was again purified on a Chromatotran silica plate
using 2 mm pre-coated UV active plate. Appropriate fractions
were mixed and concentrated in a rotary evaporator keeping the
water bath temperature at 45uC. The final pure compound was
obtained as a pale yellow viscous solid in very low yield and was
characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
and mass spectrometry.

Co-administration of Resveratrol and Lipoic Acid (tMCAO)
To examine neuroprotection following co-administration of
various doses of resveratrol (261025 (n = 5), 261026 (n = 5),
261027 (n = 6), 261028 (n = 6), or 261029 (n = 6) mg/kg) with
LA (0.005 mg/kg) on ischemia-reperfusion injury in our tMCAO
model, resveratrol and LA were combined into a single solution
and administered (1.0 ml/kg; iv) 30 minutes prior to MCAO. The
MCA was occluded for 30 minutes followed by 5.5 hours of
reperfusion.
Delayed treatment effects were also studied by co-injecting
resveratrol (261025 mg/kg) and LA (0.005 mg/kg; i.v) at the

Histological Procedures
Co-administration of Resveratrol and Lipoic Acid and
Permanent Occlusion (pMCAO)

At the end of each experiment, in which infarct volume was
measured, animals were transcardially perfused with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS; 0.1 M; 200 mL). The brains were removed
and sliced into 1 mm coronal sections with the aid of a rat brain
matrix (Harvard Apparatus; Holliston, MA, USA). Sections were
incubated in a 2% solution of 2,3,5-triphenol tetrazolium chloride
(TTC; Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis; MO, USA) for 5 minutes. Infarct
volumes were calculated with measurements taken from scanned
digital images of each brain section. The infarct area for opposing
views of each brain section was calculated using a computerassisted imaging system (Scion Corporation; Frederick, MD,
USA), averaged and multiplied by section thickness (1 mm) to
give a measure of infarct volume for each section. The sum total of
the individual infarct volumes provided the infarct volume for each
rat.

To determine if the co-administration of resveratrol and LA was
neuroprotective on ischemia-induced cell death only, co-injection
of resveratrol and LA (261025 mg/kg and LA, 0.005 mg/kg; i.v.;
n = 4) or vehicle (propylene glycol; 461023% (v/v); 1 ml/kg; i.v.;
n = 4) were made 30 minutes prior to pMCAO. The experiments
were terminated at the end of 6 hours of occlusion with no
reperfusion period.

UPEI-200 or 201 Effects in tMCAO or pMCAO
The effects of UPEI-200 and UPEI-201 on infarct volume in
both transient and permanent MCAO models were investigated.
Dose-response curves were generated for both entities (n = 4–7/
group). UPEI-201 was further studied for its effectiveness in
delayed intervention by administering a neuroprotective dose

for protein. Apoptotic cell death was quantified using an ELISA
based assay for determination of cytoplasmic histone-associated
DNA fragments (Roche Diagnostics, Montreal, QC, CAN).

Co-administration of Resveratrol - Lipoic Acid and
Apoptosis
In a separate set of experiments, the co-administration of
resveratrol (261025 mg/kg) and LA (0.005 mg/kg; i.v.; n = 4) or
vehicle (propylene glycol; 461023% (v/v); 1 ml/kg; i.v.; n = 4)
were made 30 minutes prior to tMCAO. The sutures were left in
place for 30 minutes followed by 5.5 hours of reperfusion. Animals
were transcardially perfused with 200 mL of 0.1 M phosphate
buffered saline (pH 7.4), the brains removed and the ipsilateral
cerebral cortex isolated by careful dissection. A biopsy needle
having an internal diameter of 8 mm was used to collect tissue
from the region of infarct. The region of infarct was visually
identified as that area which displayed a grayish hue and was
slightly swollen compared to the surrounding healthy tissue. The
biopsy needle was centered on this area and the tissue sample
removed.
The tissue was weighed and homogenized (20% w/v) in ice cold
PBS. The homogenate was centrifuged 12 0006g for 15 min at 4u

associated-DNA fragmentation. This biomarker suggests decreased apoptotic cell death (p#0.05; Fig. 5).
Co-injection of resveratrol (261025 mg/kg) and LA (0.005 mg/
kg) 30 minutes prior to 6 hours of permanent MCAO did not
produce significant neuroprotection (p$0.05; data not shown).
The average infarct volumes following 6 hrs of permanent MCAO
in the vehicle and resveratrol - LA treated groups were 25.366
and 19.965 mm3 respectively.

UPEI-200 and UPEI-201in tMCAO and pMCAO
UPEI-200 is a chemical construct composed of 3 LA moieties
bonded to a single resveratrol molecule (3:1). When administered
30 minutes prior to MCA occlusion in either tMCAO or pMCAO
models, there was no significant neuroprotection observed at any
of the doses tested (p$0.05; Fig. 6A, 6B).
Conversely, UPEI-201, which is composed of a single LA
moiety bound to resveratrol (1:1), displayed potent neuroprotection when administered 30 minutes prior to MCA in tMCAO
(Fig. 7A; p#0.05). Delayed intervention with UPEI-201
(161026 mg/kg) was successful in reducing infarct volume when
administered 15 minutes into the occlusion period (15 min;
p#0.05, Fig. 8), but not when administered at the start or
reperfusion or 30 minutes into the 5.5 hr reperfusion period (30,
60 min; Fig. 8).

evident by a reduction in mean infarct volume with increasing
doses of resveratrol (Figs. 1A and B). A significant difference in
infarct volume between resveratrol treated animals and vehicle
treated controls was observed at the 2 highest doses tested
(261023 and 261024 mg/kg; p#0.05).
Resveratrol or vehicle was injected during MCAO or during the
period of reperfusion (Figure 2). There were no significant
differences in the mean infarct volumes when vehicle was injected
during MCAO or at any time point during reperfusion (p$0.05),
therefore, the vehicle data for all time points was pooled (n = 29).
However, all statistical comparisons were made between the
infarct volumes measured following resveratrol and vehicle
administration for each time point. When resveratrol treatment
(261023 mg/kg; i.v.) was delayed until 15 minutes into the
ischemic period or 90 minutes into the reperfusion period
(120 min post occlusion) there was no effect on infarct volume
when compared to vehicle injected controls (p$0.05; Fig. 2).
However, significant neuroprotection was observed when resveratrol (261023 mg/kg) was administered at the start of the
reperfusion period (30 minutes post-occlusion), or at 30 and 60
minutes into the reperfusion period (60 and 90 minutes postocclusion; p#0.05 at each time point; Fig. 2).

Effects of UPEI-201on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate
Since UPEI-201 was observed to provide neuroprotection in the
tMCAO model, the following experiment was designed to
determine the effect of UPEI-201 on arterial pressure and heart
rate for a period of 2 hrs following administration. Baseline MAP
and mean HR prior to drug administration were 10969 mm/Hg
and 378627 bpm, respectively. Intravenous administration of
UPEI-201 (161026 mg/kg; n = 4) did not significantly alter mean
arterial blood pressure or mean HR at any time point during the
2 hrs of continuous recording compared with vehicle (n = 4;
P$0.05; data not shown).

Discussion
Dietary plant phenolics such as resveratrol are being widely
used in supplement form to prevent and treat common health
concerns. Potential safety issues exist as high doses of resveratrol
have been shown to cause renal toxicity [25] and contribute to
hepatic oxidative stress [26]. In the presence of peroxidase and/or
transition metals, resveratrol may function as a pro-oxidant
ultimately contributing to DNA damage and mitochondrial
dysfunction [27] [28]. As well, resveratrol has been shown to
inhibit cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP1A1 [29], an interference
which may render other drugs in a patient’s treatment plan
ineffective at therapeutic doses. Clearly, the health benefits of
resveratrol are extensive and hence, finding ways to harness the
potency of resveratrol in the absence of adverse side effects is
desirable.
To this end, we show in this study that resveratrol on its own
produced dose-dependent neuroprotection against neuronal cell
death in a rodent model of transient ischemia-reperfusion injury
[24]. Combined injection of resveratrol with a non-neuroprotective dose of a-lipoic acid [12] prior to tMCAO produced
neuroprotection at doses of resveratrol 100 fold less than when
injected alone. By chemically bonding resveratrol to lipoic acid in
a 1:1 ratio (UPEI-201), we were able to show a further dose
reduction (ten-fold lower) coincident with significant neuroprotection which supports the advantage of combination therapy in
stroke treatment.

Co-administration of Resveratrol and Lipoic Acid
The combined pre-administration of resveratrol and LA 30
minutes prior to tMCAO produced a dose-dependent reduction in
infarct volume compared to vehicle injected controls when
measured following 5.5 hrs of reperfusion (Fig. 3). This effect
was significant at the 2 highest doses of resveratrol (261026 and
261025 mg/kg; p#0.05; Fig. 3). Delaying treatment of resveratrol
(261025 mg/kg) and LA (0.005 mg/kg) until 15 minutes following the onset of tMCAO was neuroprotective however no
significant effect was observed when the same combination of
resveratrol and LA was injected immediately prior to suture
removal and the onset of reperfusion (30 minutes post occlusion;
Fig. 4).

resveratrol (261025 mg/kg) and LA (0.005 mg/kg) 30 minutes
prior to tMCAO displayed lower levels of cytoplasmic histonePLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

Co-Administration of LA and Res in Neuroprotection

Numerous studies have proven the efficacy of treatment with
lipoic acid in disease states reflective of pro- and antioxidant
imbalance such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, cancer and
cerebrovascular disease [30] [31] [32]. The chemical characteristics of LA, as well as its reduced form dihydrolipoic acid, qualify
it as an effective scavenger of hydroxyl radicals, nitric oxide,
peroxyl radicals and peroxynitrites, singlet oxygen species and
hypochlorous acid [33]. Previously in our laboratory, we showed
that LA pretreatment was effective as a neuroprotectant in both
reperfusion injury following tMCAO [12] as well as in permanent
ischemia (pMCAO) [13]. In the present study, combination of LA
with resveratrol did not protect against neuronal death in a model
of pMCAO. Prolonged ischemia is characterized by glutamateinduced neuronal toxicity ultimately leading to necrosis [3].
Generation of oxidative radicals is minimal owing to the lack of
blood flow and dampening of mitochondrial activity, thereby
rendering anti-oxidant therapy ineffectual. In contrast, antioxidants are highly effective in combating the oxidative stress
generated during reperfusion injury which is demonstrated in the
current study in our model of tMCAO. The reduction in infarct
volume associated with resveratrol-LA treatment correlates with
fewer necrotic cells at the ischemic core as evidenced with TTC
staining, as well as reduced apoptotic cell death in the area of the
penumbra as demonstrated by reduced oxidative DNA damage.
Other potential implications of combining resveratrol treatment
with LA include their complementary participation in cell
preserving pathways. For example, resveratrol and LA have both
been shown to enhance aldehyde dehydrogenase-2-mediated
detoxification of aldehydes in models of ethanol toxicity and
ischemia-reperfusion injury respectively [4] [5]. Both compounds
influence antioxidant status, in part through direct reduction of
reactive oxygen species, but also as modulators of endogenous
anti-oxidant systems. Resveratrol was shown to induce MnSOD
activity in isolated rat liver mitochondria while LA inhibited
glutathione peroxidase activity and induced mitochondrial uncoupling in the same model [34]. It is also noteworthy, that the LA/
dihyrolipoate system is highly efficient in the reduction of the
oxidized forms of antioxidants essentially aiding in their recycling
allowing them to work more effectively without saturation [35]. Its
dual solubility in water and lipid allows LA to interact with
antioxidants in extracellular (blood) as well intracellular (both

cytoplasmic and mitochondrial) compartments and to effectively
cross the blood-brain barrier [36].
To utilize the strategy of combinatorial therapy, we created 2
new chemical entities, UPEI-200 and 201 and determined that a
1:1 ratio of resveratrol-LA moieties (UPEI-201) was preferred in
providing neuroprotection following ischemia-reperfusion
(tMCAO). UPEI-201 effectively provided neuroprotection when
injected 15 minutes into the period of occlusion but not when
injected during reperfusion. With dosing in the nanomolar range
providing significant neuroprotection in our model of transient
ischemia, UPEI-201 is clearly a potent neuroprotectant against
oxidative damage. Future studies will be necessary to address
mechanism of action, bioactivation, plasma stability, and preconditioning applications. Recent figures estimate medication noncompliance at around 50% at a cost of $300 hundred billion a year
[37]. Novel compounds such as UPEI-201 which aim to provide
multi-level care in a single dose, may improve compliance and
could make a significant contribution to global health initiatives in
treating and/or preventing cerebrovascular disease. In contrast,
the ineffectiveness of UPEI-200 to provide neuroprotection in
either tMCAO or pMCAO paradigms clearly demonstrates the
utility of bioassay-guided optimization to achieve the ideal ratio of
newly synthesized bioactive molecules.
In conclusion, the results presented above support the notion
that combining antioxidants at subthreshold doses can produce
equal or enhanced neuroprotective effects. In addition, creation of
novel chemical entities via the synthetic bonding of these
antioxidants can produce comparable effects to those observed
by the co-administration of the 2 compounds, but at lower doses.
The clear advantage to lowering the dose required to gain
therapeutic effect is to minimize off-target effects on other organ
systems which may lead to side effects as is seen in so many of the
prescription drugs on the market today.
