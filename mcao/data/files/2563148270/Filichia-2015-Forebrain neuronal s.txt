INTRODUCTION
Cerebral ischemic injury is multifactorial and involves cell
death of multiple cellular components including neurons
and glial cells (Choi, 1996; Love, 2003; Zheng et al.,
2003). The tumor suppressor p53 plays an essential role
in the regulation of cell death. It has been suggested that
p53 might be involved in cell death that occurs in stroke
(Hughes et al., 1997; Li et al., 1997; Culmsee and
Mattson, 2005). p53 protein is reported upregulated after
ischemic injury and leads to p53-dependent apoptosis at
the ischemic sites (Li et al., 1994; Leker et al., 2004).
Less focal damage is found in stroke animals pre-treated
with a p53 inhibitor (Culmsee et al., 2001; Zhu et al.,
2002; Leker et al., 2004) or in traditional p53 knockout
(ko) mice (Crumrine et al., 1994). These data suggest that
p53 is an important mediator of programed cell death in
the ischemic region. However, due to widespread inhibition of p53 genes by pharmacological inhibitors and the
loss of p53 function in all cell types in traditional p53 ko
mice, the pharmacological inhibitor and genetic linkage
studies do not address the question as to whether p53
function determines the outcome of stroke by either
directly regulating the cell death of neurons or through
indirect modulation of the microenvironment in ischemic
injury. To investigate whether p53 can directly regulate
neuronal cell survival in ischemic injury, we generated
transgenic mice carrying forebrain neuronal-speciﬁc ablation of the p53 gene and examined the role of p53 in neuronal death and functional outcome after neuronal speciﬁc
p53 deletion in a cortical ischemic stroke model.

Abstract—Cerebral ischemic injury involves death of multiple cell types at the ischemic sites. As a key regulator of cell
death, the p53 gene has been implicated in the regulation of
cell loss in stroke. Less focal damage is found in stroke animals pre-treated with a p53 inhibitor or in traditional p53
knockout (ko) mice. However, whether the p53 gene plays
a direct role in regulating neuronal cell death is unknown.
In this study, in contrast to the global inhibition of p53 function by pharmacological inhibitors and in traditional p53 ko
mice, we utilized a neuronal speciﬁc conditional ko mouse
line (CamcreTRP53 loxP/loxP) to achieve forebrain neuronal
speciﬁc deletion of p53 and examined the role of the p53
gene in ischemia-induced cell death in neurons.
Expression of p53 after stroke is examined using the
immunohistochemical method and the outcome of stroke
is examined by analysis of infarction size and behavioral
deﬁcits caused by stroke. Our data showed that p53 expression is upregulated in the ischemic region in neuronal cells
in wildtype (wt) mice but not in CamcreTRP53 loxP/loxP ko
mice. Deletion of the p53 gene in forebrain neurons results
in a decreased infarction area in ko mice. Locomotor behavior, measured in automated activity chambers, showed that
CamcreTRP53 loxP/loxP ko mice have less locomotor deﬁcits
compared to wt mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo). We conclude that manipulation of p53 expression
in neurons may lead to unique therapeutic development in
stroke. Ó 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
All animal protocols were conducted under National
Institutes Health (NIH) Guidelines using the NIH
handbook Animals in Research and were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Case Western Reserve University. The mice were
housed in the animal facility of the Case Western
Reserve University on a 12-h light/dark diurnal cycle.
Food was provided ad libitum. Forebrain neuronal
speciﬁc p53 deletion mice (Fig 1A) were generated by
crossing TRP53loxP (Jonkers et al., 2001) mice with a
mouse line that carries the cre gene under the control of
the Camkinase II promoter (Minichiello et al., 1999) to generate CamcreTRP53 ko (cre+/TRP53loxP/loxP) or wildtype

(n = 17) mice. Voluntary locomotor functions were
examined using automated infra-red locomotor activity
chambers, as previously described (Luo et al., 2009).
Locomotor function was assessed by a 30-min trial in an
open ﬁeld crossed by a grid of photobeams (VersaMax
system, AccuScan Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA).
Counts were taken of the number of photobeams broken
during the trial at 5-min intervals, with separate measures
for total horizontal activity and total movement time. Total
horizontal activity corresponds to the total number of
beam interruptions that occurred in the horizontal sensor
during a given sample period and total movement time
corresponds to the amount of time that animal was in
ambulation during a given sample period. Other locomotor parameters are listed in Table 1.

(wt) mice (cre/TRP53loxP/loxP or cre+/TRP53wt/wt). The
Camkinase cre gene was genotyped by primers (50 -GGT
TAG CAC CGC AGG TGT AG-30 ; 50 -CTA ATC GCC
ATC TTC CAG CAG-30 ). TRP53 ﬂoxed alles are genotyped by the primer set (50 CAC AAA AAC AGG TTA
AAC CCA G-30 ; 50 -AGC ACA TAG GAG GCA GAG AC30 ). Deletion of the exon 1-10 of the p53 gene results in
ampliﬁcation of a DloxP band, which is ampliﬁed by a
set of primers ﬂanking the 50 of exon 1 and 30 of exon 10.
Cortical ischemia model (distal MCA occlusion)
Focal cerebral ischemia was produced in the mice using
our procedure described previously (Shen et al., 2008;
Luo et al., 2009). The mice were anesthetized with chloral
hydrate (0.4 g/kg, i.p.). Body temperature was monitored
and maintained at 37 °C degrees by a heating pad. The
surgical area was shaved and prepared with alternating
betadine scrubs and ethanol. A small 5-mm vertical skin
incision was cut between the right eye and ear to expose
the skull. A small window was drilled open in the skull to
expose the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The right
MCA was ligated with 10-0 suture for 90 min followed by
removal of the ligating suture to allow for reperfusion.
The skin wound was closed with sutures and the mice
were placed in a heated animal intensive care unit chamber until recovery of the righting reﬂex.
Behavioral tests
Locomotion function was measured before stroke and 48
hr after stroke in CamcreTPR53 ko (n = 16) and wt

Male adult (3–4 months old) CamcreTRP53 ko and wt mice
were initially subjected to baseline locomotion function. At
48 h after stroke, animals were subjected to post-stroke
locomotion examination. After the behavioral tests, ko
and wt mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA) and the brains were immunostained with both an
anti-NeuN antibody and cresyl violet Nissl staining as
described (Fujimoto et al., 2008) to assess the area of neuronal loss. The brain sections were also immunostained
with anti-p53 and anti-MAP2 antibody to examine the
expression of p53 protein in the contralateral and ipsilateral
sides of the brain, as detailed below.
Immunohistochemistry and infarction area
quantiﬁcation
Mice were perfused transcardially with a solution of 4%
PFA (pH 7.2) in 0.1 M phosphate buﬀer (PB, pH 7.2).
Brains were removed from the skull, postﬁxed in 4%
PFA overnight at 4 °C, rinsed with PB, and sequentially
transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB, pH 7.2
solutions over night. Brains were frozen on dry ice and
sectioned on a cryostat to obtain coronal sections of
25 lm in thickness.
Sections were rinsed with PB prior to processing for
immunocytochemistry, blocked in PB containing 4%
bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.3% Triton X-100 and
10% goat serum for 1 h at RT followed by incubation with
mouse anti-NeuN primary antibody (Millipore, 1:500) for
24 hr at 4 °C. Primary antibody dilutions were in PB
containing 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1% goat
serum. After rinsing 3  10 min in PB, sections were
processed with an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA). Sections were then incubated in
a 1:200 dilution of the biotinylated anti–mouse secondary
antibody. After rinsing with PB, sections were incubated
with avidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase for 1 h.
Samples were rinsed and the peroxidase reaction was
developed with 0.05% 3,3-diaminobenzidine-4 HCl (DAB)
and 0.003% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Sections were
mounted on coated slides, air dried, dehydrated in 75%,
95% and 100% ethanol followed by 10-min Xylene. The
slides were coverslipped for viewing under polarized light
microscope. Images were captured with the microscope
(Leica Microsystem Inc., Bannockburn, IL, USA) and the

infarction area in each animal was quantiﬁed using NIS
element software by blinded observers. The boundaries
of neuronal degeneration were outlined by loss of NeuN
staining in the cortex. The total area on the contralateral
side was measured and subtracted by the total surviving
area in the stroke side to calculate the infarction area.
This method minimizes the potential error that might be
introduced by edema by measuring the volumes of the
surviving, noninfarcted tissue rather than the volumes of
the infarcted tissue per se (Swanson et al., 1990). A set
of adjacent sections were subjected to cresyl violet Nissl
staining and the infarct area in each animal was quantiﬁed
using the same method as described above.
Immunoﬂurescent staining of p53 (monoclonal, Cell
Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) and MAP2 (polyclonal rabbit, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) protein was carried out
with similar methods as described above with the
exception of the antigen-retrieval process and the use of
a ﬂuorescent secondary antibody. Activated astrocytes
and microglial cells were identiﬁed using anti-GFAP
(monoclonal, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and Iba1 (rabbit,
Wako, Osaka, Japan) antibodies followed by incubation
with ﬂuorescent secondary antibodies. Omission of primary or secondary antibodies resulted in no staining and
served as negative controls. Activated astrocytes and
microglial cells were quantiﬁed by counting ﬁve randomly
selected counting frames (40) expanding the infarct
boundary for each animal and the average of total positive
cells per ﬁeld was calculated for each animal. For activated
microglial cell body size measurement, the cell body
diameter was measured using NIS element software by
blinded observers and an average of 30 cells were measured for each animal. A total of ﬁve wt and ﬁve ko mouse
brains were analyzed to quantify activated astrocytes and
microglial cells.

were performed using unbiased sterological principles
and
analyzed
with
StereoInvestigator
software
(Microbrightﬁeld, Williston, VT, USA). Optical fractionator
sampling was carried out on a Leica DM5000B
microscope (Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL,
USA) equipped with a motorized stage and Lucivid
attachment (40 objective). The neuronal cell density in
each layer was measured using unbiased stereological
principles. Diﬀerent layers of cortical layers I through VI
of the neocortex in the somatosensory and motor cortex
area were outlined according to neuronal cell type,
shape and density. Basically, Layer I (molecular layer) is
located underneath the meninges and consists of
neuropil and few cell bodies of neurons. Layer II/III
contains
many granule
(stellate)
cells (small
interneurons) and numerous cone-shaped cell bodies of
small pyramidal cells. Layer IV (internal granular layer) is
composed of granule cells. Layer V (internal pyramidal
layer) contains cell bodies of large pyramidal cells. Layer
VI (fusiform or multiform layer) is dominated by
elongated spindle-shaped (fusiform) cells. For each
tissue section analyzed, section thickness was assessed
at each sampling site and a guard zone of 2.5 lm was
used at the top and bottom of each section. Pilot studies
were used to determine suitable counting frame and
sampling grid dimensions prior to counting. The following
stereolgic parameters were used in the ﬁnal study: grid
size, (X) 220 lm, (Y) 166 lm; Counting frame, (X)
68.2 lm, (Y) 75 lm; depth was 20 lm. Gundersen
coeﬃcients of error for m = 1 were all less than 0.10.
Stereologic estimations were performed with the same
parameters in all layers of wt or CamcreTRP53 ko mice
(n = 4 for each genotype).

RESULTS
In our transgenic model, Cre recombinase expression is
driven by the Camkinase promoter and many studies
have used this mouse line to evaluate forebrain
neuronal speciﬁc gene deletion in mice. To determine
the speciﬁc deletion of the mTRP53 gene in the
forebrain, primers speciﬁc to the recombination (DloxP)
were used to amplify the recombined TRP53 allele. As
expected, only tissue obtained from the cortex, striatum,
olfactory bulb and hippocampus contained DloxP,
conﬁrming the deletion of the p53 gene in these brain
areas. In contrast, the cerebellum, that was previously
reported to have no or minimal recombination
(Minichiello et al., 1999), was found to be negative for

recombination PCR product, indicating lack of p53 gene
deletion in the cerebellum in our CamcreTRP53 mice.
(Fig. 1B upper panel). All brain tissues from diﬀerent
regions were also subjected to PCR reactions that
detected the loxP ﬂanked allele to conﬁrm the quality of
DNA as well as the genotype of ko mice (Fig. 1B lower
panel).
The CamcreTRP53 ko mice were born at expected
Mendelian frequencies and showed normal viability. The
body weights of adult ko and wt mice were not
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (wt = 26.6 ± 0.8, ko = 27.2 ± 0.5;
p = 0.58, n = 16). Additionally in adult mice, no
apparent diﬀerences in the general structure and density
of cortical neurons were noted between wt and ko
animals (Fig. 2B, C, D show representative images of

the motor cortex in wt and ko mice). Unbiased
stereological counts of NeuN-positive cells in layers I
through VI in somatosensory and part of the motor
cortex showed no diﬀerence in neuronal cell density in
various layers between wt and CamcreTRP53 ko mice
(Fig. 2E, F). Basal locomotion tests performed prior to
stroke at age 3–4 months in automated behavioral
chambers did not reveal any diﬀerence between the ko
and wt mice (total horizontal activity – the total number
of beam interruptions that occurred in the horizontal
sensor during 30 min, wt = 13255.9 ± 845.6, n = 17;
ko = 14573.6 ± 845.6,
n = 16;
p = 0.246;
total
movement time – the amount of time that animal was in
ambulation during 30 min, wt = 662.3 ± 9.2, n = 17;
ko = 732.3 ± 43.8, n = 16; p = 0.271). Distal MCA
occlusion resulted in p53 protein upregulation in the
penumbra on the stroke side but not in the contralateral
cortex (Fig 3). Interestingly, wt mice showed induction of
p53 protein both within neurons (arrow in Fig 3 panel i
right, 48% of p53-positive cells) and other cell types
(arrow head in Fig 3 panel i right, 52% of p53-positive
cells, total of 150 p53-positive cells counted). However,
in CamcreTRP53 ko mice, p53 protein expression was
only observed in the penumbra mainly in cells that were
MAP2-negative (Fig 3 ii right, arrow head, 82% of total
p53-positive cells are MAP2-negative) suggesting that
the p53 gene is upregulated in other cell types in
CamcreTRP53 ko mice but not in neurons in stroke
brain. We also found some surviving MAP2-positive
neurons near the ischemic core that were p53-negative

(Fig. 3iii, small arrow) whereas other non neuronal cells
that were in the same optical ﬁeld were p53-positive
(Fig. 3iii, arrow head). These data conﬁrm that p53
protein is induced in stroke brain both in neurons and
non neuronal cells, but are not expressed in cortical
neurons in CamcreTRP53 ko mice.
Distal MCA occlusion causes infarction in the cortex
that can be revealed by both Nissl staining and NeuN
immunostaining. Quantiﬁcation of the infarction area in
the cortex showed that neuronal deletion of the p53 gene
results in a smaller infarction size in ko mice measured by
both Nissl staining (59.7 ± 11.9% compared to wt mice
100 ± 10.6%; n = 15; p = 0.014, Fig. 4A, B) and NeuN
immunostaining (49.4 ± 8.1% compared to wt mice
100 ± 12.3%; n = 15; p = 0.0018, Fig. 4C). More
importantly, motor behavioral function analysis measured
by automated open ﬁeld chambers showed that p53
deletion in neurons in ko mice resulted in less severe
motor function deﬁcits in ko mice as demonstrated by
total horizontal activity– the total number of beam
interruptions that occurred in the horizontal sensor
during 30 min, (see Fig. 5B; wt = 6469.8 ± 619.1,
n = 17; ko = 9301 ± 780.6, n = 16; p = 0.013, twoway ANOVA), total movement time – the amount of time
that animal was in ambulation during 30 min, (see Fig. 5C;
wt = 322.94 ± 28.1, n = 17; ko = 485.16 ± 41, n = 16;
p = 0.003). All of the major eight variables showed
similar results in that CamcreTRP53 ko mice have less
deﬁcits in motor function after distal middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAo) (see Table 1).
Since activated astrocytes and microglial cells are
important elements in brain tissue damage after
ischemia, we also investigated whether neuronal deletion
of p53 gene alters the astrocytes and microglial cell
components in stroke mice. We found that both reactive
astrocytes (identiﬁed by GFAP immunoreactivity) and
activated
microglial
cells
(identiﬁed
by
Iba1
immunoreactivity and morphological changes such as
increased cell body size and shortened cellular
processes) are present at the infarct boundary, with
microglial cells located closer to the ischemic area
surrounded by GFAP-positive cells in the outer layer
(Fig. 6A). We also quantiﬁed the density of GFAPpositive and Iba1-positive cells in the activated infarct
boundary and found that the density of GFAP-positive
cells (Fig. 6B) and Iba1-positive cells (Fig. 6C) at the
infarct boundary showed no diﬀerence between the wt
and ko mice. However, the average size of activated
microglia (measured by diameter of Iba1 cells) was
smaller in ko mice compared to wt mice (see Fig 6D,
wt = 59.3 ± 2.8
pixels;
ko = 51.4 ± 1.7
pixels;
p = 0.04. n = 5 for wt and ko mice, >30 cells measured
for each mouse).

Fig. 3. p53 protein is detected in ischemic penumbra in wt mice both
in MAP2-positive and MAP2-negative cells (arrow and arrow head,
Panel i right) but is not detected in the contralateral cortex (panel i and
ii left). In CamcreTRP53 ko mice, p53 protein is mainly detected in
MAP2-negative cells but not in neurons (panel ii right, arrow heads).
We also identiﬁed some surviving MAP2-positive neurons near the
ischemic core that are negative for p53 expression (panel iii left and
right, short arrow). Scale bar = 100 lm.

DISCUSSION
p53 protein expression and function have been implicated
in the cellular and molecular mechanisms of ischemic
injury in many previous studies (Crumrine et al., 1994;
Zhu et al., 2002; Culmsee and Mattson, 2005). Once activated, p53 increases transcription of a variety of key

genes involved in the development of programed cell
death that comprise pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2
family (Bax, Bad, Bid, Noxa, Puma) involved in mitochondrial outer membrane permeablilization, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) as well as other
apoptosis regulatory proteins such as SIVA1 (Culmsee
and Mattson, 2005; Chatoo et al., 2011; Smith et al.,
2013). Additionally, p53 has transcription-independent
proapoptotic actions, including association with mitochondria (Marchenko et al., 2000), resulting in outer membrane permeabilization and consequent release of
mitochondrial proapoptotic factors into the cytosol, such
as cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO; these activate caspase-dependent apoptosis (Saelens et al., 2004; Green,
2006; Nijboer et al., 2011). p53 expression is upregulated
in the ischemic brain (Li et al., 1994) as well as in other
acute neurological insults, including traumatic brain injury
(TBI) (Greig et al., 2004; Plesnila et al., 2007; Nijboer
et al., 2011; Rachmany et al., 2013). The p53 inhibitor

PFT-a delivered both before and post stroke attenuates
ischemic injury and promotes the survival of regenerating
cells after stroke (Crumrine et al., 1994; Luo et al., 2009)
as well as TBI (Plesnila et al., 2007; Rachmany et al.,
2013). Likewise, the use of PFT-l, a small agent that inhibits the interaction of p53 with mitochondria without
impacting its transcriptional activity, mitigates perinatal
hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (Nijboer et al., 2011).
Furthermore, general deletion of the p53 gene in traditional p53 ko mice or decreased dosage of p53 in
heterozygous mice provides protection against ischemic
injury (Crumrine et al., 1994). A recent study has reported
that the human Trp53 Arg72Pro polymorphism helps
explain diﬀerent functional prognosis in stroke patients
(Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2011). However, whether p53
function regulates neuronal cell death directly or through
modulation of the microenvironment by controlling cell
death of glia or other cells is unknown. In this study, using
a forebrain neuronal speciﬁc p53 deletion mouse model,

we evaluated the direct involvement of the p53 gene in
neuronal cell death that occurs in ischemic injury. This
strategy represents a signiﬁcant advantage because it
permits a speciﬁc evaluation of p53 function in these cells,
compared to the non-selective eﬀects of pharmacological
inhibitors on multiple cell types in multiple anatomical
regions, and at concentrations where agents such as
PFT-a can potentially provide other actions (Neitemeier
et al., 2014).
The role of p53 in the pathophysiology of central
nervous system (CNS) injuries remains complex and
warrants further elucidation, as a non-apoptotic role of
p53 has been implicated in the promotion of neuronal
and axonal regeneration after cellular insults (Tedeschi
and Di Giovanni, 2009). Such a variety of actions can be
attributed to factors such as the cell types, their
microenvironment and both the form and severity of injury
involved, in addition to when p53 activity and involved signaling pathways are evaluated. Models that permit the
separation of these factors to allow the characterization
of p53 action in neurons are thus valuable. The eﬀectiveness of speciﬁc p53 deletion in the forebrain but in
no other brain regions was conﬁrmed by PCR in
CamcreTRP53 loxP/loxP ko mice (Fig 1). Loss of the p53
gene in forebrain neurons did not lead to an abnormal
development of the cortex, as demonstrated by the regular
structure of the forebrain and normal neuronal cell density
(NeuN-positive cells) in ko mice (Fig 2). The Camkinase
cre line has been utilized in many studies previously to
speciﬁcally study the role of certain genes in forebrain neurons (Minichiello et al., 1999; Rios et al., 2001). It was
reported that ﬂoxed gene recombination occurs at about
postnatal day 20 (Dragatsis and Zeitlin, 2000). Because

of no or minimal gene deletion during embryogenesis, this
animal model enables us to examine the role of the p53
gene in adult neuronal cell death during stroke without
potential confounding factors, such as possible
developmental changes that occur within the general
structure of the neocortex. Our data also suggest that
the p53 gene might not be critical for the postnatal apoptotic processes that eliminate excess neurons during postnatal development (Kim and Sun, 2011). Following the
induction of a stroke, immunostaining showed that p53
protein is induced in both neurons and non-neuronal cells
within the penumbra but not in the contralateral cortex (Fig
3). However, in CamcreTRP53 ko mice, p53 expression
was mainly detected in non neuronal cells at the penumbra
(Fig 3). Interestingly, we also identiﬁed some surviving
MAP2-positive neurons near the ischemic core that are
p53-negative, suggesting that lack of p53 in these neurons
might contribute to their survival within the penumbra.
Indeed, we found that loss of p53 in forebrain neurons in
adult mice proved protective against ischemic injury after
stroke (MCAo). CamcreTRP53 ko mice showed smaller
infarction areas compared to their wt littermates. Both
Nissl staining and NeuN immunostaining were carried
out to measure infarct size in this study. Nissl staining is
a widely accepted and commonly used conventional
histological technique to identify infarcts in stroke animals
(Popp et al., 2009). NeuN immunostaining have recently
been utilized to visualize neuronal cell loss in CNS injuries
including stroke, especially selective neuronal loss (Liu
et al., 2009; Baron et al., 2014; Emmrich et al., 2015).
Both techniques demonstrated decreased infarct size in
CamcreTPR53 ko mice compared to their wt littermates.
Interestingly, NeuN immunostaining demonstrated a

Fig. 6. Reactive astrocytes (GFAP-positive) and activated microglia (Iba1-positive) were observed in the periinfarct area in ischemic brains of wt
and CamcreTRP53 mice (panel A). The number of activated astrocytes (panel B) and microglia (panel C) are similar in wt and ko mice but microglial
cells in ko mice have a smaller cell body size measured by diameter of Iba1-positive cells (panel D). ⁄Indicates p < 0.05, n = 5 animals per group

slightly smaller infarct size (49.4 ± 8.1% compared
to wt mice identiﬁed by NeuN immunostaining vs
59.7 ± 11.9% compared to wt mice using Nissl staining).
It has been shown that at earlier time points (6–24 h after
MCAo), conventional histological techniques, such as
Nissl or TTC, show similar results; however, NeuN
immunostaining can recover at later time points (48 or
72 h after MCAo) which might reﬂect transiently damaged
neurons that later ‘‘regain their staining pattern after
repair’’ (Liu et al., 2009). In our study, both stainings were
carried out at 48 h and neuronal deletion of p53 might
result in recovery of initially damaged neuronal cells that
lack p53 protein. This suggests that NeuN staining might
be a more sensitive marker for measuring true neuronal
damage. The surviving neurons close to the core of the
infarct area (peri infarct area) might play an important role
in infarct growth and neurovasculature repair. Since damage to neurons and vasculature are the current predominant hypotheses in the ‘‘neurovascular’’ pathology of
stroke, we speculate that the p53-deﬁcient neurons in
the peri infarct area might survive the initial ischemic
insult and recover in later stages of infarct development.
The surviving p53-deﬁcient neurons might contribute to
less depolarization, excitotoxicity and consequent

inﬂammatory and neurovasculature damage which all play
a critical role in pathological development in stroke
(Shinozuka et al., 2013). Indeed, our data showed that
although the cell density for activated astrocytes and
microglia were not diﬀerent between wt and ko mice, the
size of microglia cell body, an indication of the extent of
their activation (Eggen et al., 2013) is smaller in ko mice
brain at the infarct boundary, suggesting that selective survival of p53-lacking neurons might lead to less inﬂammatory responses which could contribute to a smaller infarct
area and subsequent better recovery after stroke. It is possible that selective survival of neurons the in the peri
infarct area might also facilitate reestablishment of neuronal connections and repair of the neurovasculature in
injured animals through regulation of various genes such
as BDNF (Luo et al., 2013), ATRX, IGF1 and Lingo1: (Li
et al., 2010). Although our study only analyzed infarction
and neuronal survival at 48 h after stroke, it will be valuable to follow these mice longer after ischemic onset to
evaluate the eﬀect of neuronal p53 gene deletion on the
later development of stroke pathology.
Locomotor behavior, measured in automated activity
chambers, showed that CamcreTRP53 ko mice have
less locomotor deﬁcits compared to wt mice after

MCAo. Distal MCAo in mice aﬀects mostly the primary
somatosensory cortex and part of the lateral motor
cortex. Damage in these areas caused by distal MCAo
results in compromised sensorimotor performance in
rodents (Freret et al., 2009; Balkaya et al., 2013). The
open ﬁeld test is widely used to evaluate motor function
and normal exploratory locomotion in rodents (Belzung
and Griebel, 2001; Luo et al., 2009). In this study, we utilized an automated open ﬁeld apparatus that minimizes
disturbing eﬀects induced by a human observer.
Utilizing the same apparatus, our group has shown a positive correlation of infarct size at 48 h post dMCAo and
multiple parameters measured by this apparatus (Shen
and Wang, 2010) in rats. In this study, all of the eight main
parameters measured demonstrated less severe deﬁcits
in CamcreTRP53 ko mice, except for total vertical activity
(total number of beam interruptions in the vertical sensor)
that showed a similar trend but was not statistically signiﬁcant. Our initial investigation of reactive astrocytes and
activated microglial cells suggests that improved neuronal
survival in the peri infarct area in ko mice is correlated
with reduced microglial activation. Microglial activation is
associated with production of detrimental inﬂammatory
factors (Perry et al., 2010) and is closely related to selective neuronal loss after ischemia (Baron et al., 2014;
Emmrich et al., 2015). Recently, it has also been shown
that microglial cells actually play dual and opposite roles
in inﬂammatory response progression in stroke depending on whether they manifest an M1 (pro-inﬂammation
and ‘‘injurious’’ phenotype) or an M2 (anti-inﬂammation
and protective phenotype) (Hu et al., 2012). Therefore,
additional analysis of the proﬁle of classes of microglial
cell activation and other potential pathological mechanisms, such as endothelium and neurovasculature repair,
are warranted in future studies. In summary, our data suggest that loss of p53 function speciﬁcally in forebrain neurons can protect these cells from ischemic injury occurring
after stroke, and add support to the notion that short-term
transient inactivation of p53 might provide a new treatment strategy for improved prognosis in acute life-altering
neurological disorders (Greig et al., 2004; Gudkov and
Komarova, 2005). The use of tetrahydrobenzothiazole
analog p53 inhibitors (Zhu et al., 2002) and other newly
synthesized analogs (Strom et al., 2006) has aided in
characterizing the fundamental role of p53 in the biochemical cascades that lead to neuronal apoptosis across
both cellular and animal models (Culmsee and Mattson,
2005; Gudkov and Komarova, 2010). These same agents
have additionally demonstrated that this p53 mediated
system is amenable to reversal by blocking the apoptotic
cascade to mitigate neuronal loss in stroke, TBI and epilepsy animal models (Zhu et al., 2002; Leker et al., 2004;
Plesnila et al., 2007; Engel et al., 2010; Nijboer et al.,
2011; Sano et al., 2012; Rachmany et al., 2013) when
administered up to approximately 6 h after the event.
Our present study suggests that neuronal-speciﬁc, rather
than a global p53 inhibition approach, may achieve neuronal preservation with less potential adverse eﬀects that
may ensue (Gudkov and Komarova, 2010). Application of
pharmacological inhibition of p53 in neuronal, glial or
endothelial speciﬁc p53 gene deletion animal models

may also provide valuable insights on the precise role of
diﬀerent cellular components in pathological development
in stroke and should be considered for future studies.
