Abstract Daphnetin (DAP), a coumarin derivative, has
been reported to have multiple pharmacological actions
including analgesia, antimalarial, anti-arthritic, and antipyretic properties. It is unclear whether DAP has neuroprotective effects on ischemic brain injury. In this study,
we found that DAP treatment (i.c.v.) reduced the infarct
volume at 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion injury and
improved neurological behaviors in a middle cerebral
artery occlusion mouse model. Moreover, we provided
evidences that DAP had protective effects on infarct volume in neonate rats even it was administrated at 4 h after
cerebral hypoxia/ischemia injury. To explore its neuroprotective mechanisms of DAP, we examined the

protection of DAP on glutamate toxicity-induced cell death
in hippocampal HT-22 cells. Our results demonstrated that
DAP protected against glutamate toxicity in HT-22 cells in
a concentration-dependent manner. Further, we found that
DAP maintained the cellular levels of glutathione and
superoxide dismutase activity, suggesting the anti-oxidatant activity of DAP. Since DAP has been used for the
treatment of coagulation disorder and rheumatoid arthritis
for long time with a safety profile, DAP will be a promising
agent for the treatment of stroke.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide in adults [1, 2]. The only clinical treatment
for ischemic stroke approved by the United States Food and
Drug Administration is thromblytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) to recovery cerebral
blood flow. However, due to its toxicity and short time
window, only 4–5 % of stroke patients benefit from rtPA
treatment [3, 4]. Therefore, it is urgent to discover new
effective drugs for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
Chinese medicine has a long history for the treatment of
stroke in China. Therefore, it is a new strategy to find some
neuroprotectants from Chinese medicine or Chinese herbs.
D. marginata is a well-known flowering plant and its roots,
stems, leaves, and flowers are used as medicinal materials
to promote blood circulation and relieve pain [5]. Daphnetin (DAP) is one of main extract from D. marginata [5].
Daphnetin has been developed as an oral medicine for
treatment of coagulation disorders and rheumatoid arthritis

in China [6]. Structurally, Daphnetin is a coumarin derivates with a cell-permeable property [7]. Similar to other
coumarin derivates, DAP has been reported to have many
pharmacological actions including antimalarial [8], antiarthritic [9] and anti-pyretic properties [6]. Although
Daphnetin has a broad clinical application, few studies pay
attention to its activities in the central nervous system,
especially in the field of cerebral ischemia injury.
In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of
DAP on glutamate-induced neuronal cell death, MCAOinduced ischemic brain injury in mice, and hypoxia/
ischemia (H/I)-induced brain damage in neonate rats. We
provided evidences to demonstrate the protection of DAP
in vivo and in vitro on oxidant toxicity and ischemic brain
injury.

Aldrich Company, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) for 8 h. Cells
were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysized in lysis buffer, and then collected with a rubber
policeman. Lysates were left on ice for 30 min. After the
centrifugation, supernatants were collected for the determination of total GSH and intracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) level. Protein concentration was measured
by the bicinchoninic acid method. Supernatants (10 ll) or
GSH standard was mixed with 150 ll of a reaction mixture
containing 143 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 6 mM
DTNB, and 0.25 mg/ml beta-NADPH. The reaction was
started by adding 1 U/ml of GSH reductase. Color development was monitored at 405 nm in a kinetic mode with a
plate reader. GSH concentration was calculated according
to a standard curve from GSH standard. There were six
samples in each group.

Materials and Methods

Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) Measurement

The HT-22 Cell Line
Hippocampal HT-22 cells were a gift from Dr. David
Schubert (The Salk Institute, San Diego, CA, USA). Cells
were grown in DMEM containing 10 % fetal bovine
serum/2 mM L-glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin.

The samples were prepared as described above. Total SOD
was measured by an assay kit (Biyuntian Company,
Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Color development was monitored at 560 nm in a kinetic
mode with a plate reader. There were also six samples in
each group.

Cell Viability Assay

Animals

Cell viability was assessed by the ability of the viable cells
to metabolize 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl) 2-H-tetrazolium, inner
salt (MTS) as in our previous experiments [10]. Principally,
HT-22 cells were plated in 96-well plates about 5,000 cells
per well and maintained in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C
overnight prior to experimental treatments. Following
5 mM glutamate treatment for 12 h, 10 ll MTS solution
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) was added to
each well. The cells were incubated for another 3 h at
37 °C. The absorbance at 490 nm was subsequently measured. Untreated cells were considered as the control; the
growth medium without cells in the presence of MTS
solution was used as solution background. Cell viability
was calculated as a percentage compared with the control
cells.

Male ICR mice (23–28 g) and rat pups (7-day old,
18–20 g) were purchased from SLAC Company (Shanghai,
China). All animal procedures were approved by the University Committee on Animal Care of Soochow University
and conducted in accordance with the guidelines published
in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.

Intracellular Glutathione (GSH) Measurement

The Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) Model

Total GSH was measured by a standard recycling assay
based on the reduction of DTNB in the presence of GSH
reductase and NADPH as described previously [11].
Briefly, HT-22 cells were plated in 6-well dishes and kept
at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 24 h. Cells were treated
with 5 mM glutamate and/or 100 mM DAP (Sigma-

MCAO was carried out by using an intraluminal monofilament according to the method described previously [12].
Principally, the mouse was anesthetized by 7.2 % chloral
hydrate (400 mg/kg body weight). The right common carotid artery (CCA), the right external carotid artery (ECA) and
the internal carotid artery (ICA) were isolated. The ECA was

Experimental Groups
In the animal models, mice or rats were randomly assigned
into four groups (n = 6–8): vehicle-treated group (sham);
DAP-treated group (DAP group); vehicle-treated ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) group or hypoxia/ischemia (H/I) group (I/
R group or H/I group); DAP-treated I/R group or H/I group
(I/R ? DAP group or H/I ? DAP group).

ligated with a silk suture at 2 mm distal from the ECA–CCA
branch. A silk suture was looped around the CCA and twisted
to block blood flow from the CCA. A small incision near the
ECA–CCA branch about 1.5 mm was made on the ECA. A
6-0 nylon monofilament (Ethilon, Ethicon Inc., USA) coated
with silicon resin was inserted through the incision into the
right CCA and advanced about 9–11 mm. Reperfusion was
achieved by withdrawing the suture after 75 min of MCAO.
Sham mice underwent the same experimental procedures but
the nylon filament was advanced only about 5 mm.
Body temperature was maintained at 36.5–37.5 °C
throughout the procedure from the start of the surgery until
the animals recovered from anesthesia. The local cerebral
blood flow was measured by a Laser-Doppler blood flow
meter (Periflux 5010, PERIMED, Sweden).
Intracerebroventricular Administration of DAP
DAP (1 mg/kg body weight, i.c.v.) or saline was injected
into the left lateral ventricle at 1 h before MCAO via a
small burr hole in the parietal region of mice (0.5 mm
posterior and 1.0 mm lateral to the Bregma on the left
side). A 28-G needle on a syringe was inserted into the left
lateral ventricle (2.5 mm in depth), DAP or saline (10 ll)
was injected within 10 min.
Neurological Deficit Score Evaluation
Neurological deficits were evaluated at 24 h after the
MCAO. The modified scoring system was based on a
5-point scale system described previously [13]: no deficit,
0; flexion of the contralateral torso and forelimb, 1; turning
to the ipsilateral side when held by tail, 2; leaning to
affected side, 3; no spontaneous locomotor activity, 4.
The Measurement of Infarct Volume
After neurological evaluation, the mice were deeply anesthetized. The brains were removed quickly from the skull and
frozen immediately (-20 °C) for 2 min and then were cut into
1-mm slices. Slices were incubated with 0.2 % TTC (SigmaAldrich Company, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) at 37 °C for
30 min and then fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 24 h.
Finally, the slices were photographed and Alpha Ease Image
Analysis Software (V3.1.2, Alpha Innotech Corp., San
Leandro, CA) was used to analyze the infarct area in each
brain slice. The percentage of hemispheric infarction volume
was calculated as described in our previous study [14].

anesthetized with ethyl ether. The right CCA was exposed
and permanently ligated with a 4–0 suture. After the
recovery with their dam for 1 h, the pups were placed in a
chamber flushed with the mixed gas containing 8 % O2/
92 % N2 at 4 L/min for 2.5 h. The temperature of hypoxic
chamber was maintained at 37 °C in an oven. After
hypoxia, the pups were returned to the cage. DAP was
administered (10 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) just 1 h before
hypoxia or at 4 and 6 h after hypoxia/reperfusion. The
control rats were injected with 100 ll normal saline.
Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Differences
between groups were determined with Student t test for
infarct volume; statistical differences between more than
two groups were analyzed by using one-way ANOVA
followed by Turkey multiple comparison procedure. Statistical significance was placed at P \ 0.05.

Results
DAP Treatment Reduced Infarct Volume in a MCAO
Mouse Model and Improved Neurological Deficits
To examine the protective effect of DAP, we first determined its
effects on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in a MCAO
mouse model. We performed TTC staining to evaluate the
infarct volume after 75 min of MCAO and 24 h of reperfusion.
In the sham group, there was no infarction area; but there was a
large infarct volume in I/R group (Fig. 1a). DAP (1 mg/kg
body weight, i.c.v.) was administrated at 1 h before ischemia
and significantly reduced the infarct volume compared with I/R
group (Fig. 1a). Quantitative analysis indicated that DAP
reduced infarct volume by approximately 24.6 % compared
with I/R group (P \ 0.05, Fig. 1b). Neurological scores were
also examined just before the mice were killed for TTC staining. Evaluation showed no significant neurological deficits in
mice of sham group and DAP group, however, severe neurological deficits were observed in the mice of I/R group
(P \ 0.05, Fig. 1c). The mice in I/R group consistently showed
circling movements, severe paw flections, or less spontaneous
movements. In DAP pre-I/R group, the mice had fewer
abnormal movement postures or circling movements. DAP
treatment significantly improved the neurological functions and
decreased neurological scores (P \ 0.05, Fig. 1c).

H/I neonatal model. Seven-day old rats were used to
examine the protective effect of DAP on H/I injury. DAP
(10 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) was administrated just 1 h
before hypoxia or 4 and 6 h after hypoxia/reperfusion. After
2.5 h of hypoxia and 48 h of reperfusion, neonates were
killed and the brain slices were stained by TTC. From
Fig. 2a, H/I injury caused large infarct volume
(41.56 ± 1.36 % of the hemisphere); DAP pre-treatment
(1 h before hypoxia) reduced infarct volume to
26.02 ± 1.29 % of the hemisphere; DAP post-treatment at
4 h after hypoxia/reperfusion also significantly reduced
infarct volume to 32.75 ± 1.53 % of the hemisphere compared with H/I group (P \ 0.05, Fig. 2b), indicating the
protective effect of DAP post-treatment; however, DAP
treatment at 6 h after hypoxia/reperfusion reduced infarct
volume to 37.15 ± 2.30 % of the hemisphere, which had no
protection compared with H/I group (P [ 0.05, Fig. 2b).
DAP Protected Against Glutamate-Induced Cell Death
in HT-22 Cells
Since DAP demonstrated protective effects on cerebral ischemia injury, we next explored the possible mechanisms on DAP
protection. Previous study showed that the DAP has anti-oxidative activity in a cell-free system [16], therefore, we examined the effect of DAP on glutamate toxicity-induced cell death.
Our previous studies have indicated that the glutamate-induced
cell death model in HT-22 cells was a useful cell model to

examine the protection of chemical compounds on oxidative
stress [10, 17]. To demonstrate the protection of DAP, we
treated HT-22 cells with 5 mM glutamate and different concentrations of DAP. After the incubation with 5 mM glutamate
for 12 h, most HT-22 cells lost their neurites and normal
morphology compared with control cells (Fig. 3a). However,
DAP (100 lM) protected HT-22 cells against glutamate toxicity and almost recovered the morphological changes
(Fig. 3a). To quantify the protective effect of DAP, cell viability was measured by the MTS assay. The results indicated
that DAP did not provide any protection below the concentration of 10 lM (P [ 0.05, Fig. 3b), but when the concentration
of DAP was more than 25 lM, DAP showed concentrationdependent protection on glutamate-induced cell death
(P \ 0.05, Fig. 3b). Compared with the control cells, 100 lM
DAP completely protected against glutamate toxicity
(P [ 0.05, Fig. 3b). In addition, 100 lM DAP treatment alone
did not produce drug toxicity (P [ 0.05, Fig. 3b).
DAP Blocked GSH Depletion After Glutamate
Treatment
Our previous studies have indicated that glutamate can cause
oxidative stress in HT-22 cells and decrease cellular GSH,
which has anti-oxidative activity and plays an important role to
maintain intra-cellular normal redox state [18, 19]. To evaluate
whether DAP protects against glutamate toxicity by reducing
oxidative stress and increasing cellular GSH level, we measured intracellular GSH contents after glutamate and/or DAP
treatment in HT-22 cells. Total GSH decreased markedly 8 h
after the addition of 5 mM glutamate compared with the control group (P \ 0.05, Fig. 4). DAP (100 lM) did not increase
the basal GSH level, but it significantly blocked the GSH
depletion caused by glutamate treatment (P \ 0.01, Fig. 4).
DAP Increased SOD Activity After Glutamate
Treatment
SOD is one of important enzymes to remove excess
intracellular oxidative stress [20]. In this study, we also
examined the effects of glutamate and DAP on SOD
activity. Our results showed that SOD activity was
decreased markedly at 8 h after 5 mM glutamate treatment
(P \ 0.05, Fig. 5). However, DAP (100 lM) reversed the
decreased activity of SOD elicited by glutamate toxicity
(P \ 0.05, Fig. 3). In addition, DAP alone did not affect
normal SOD activity in the control cells (P [ 0.05, Fig. 5).

Fig. 3 DAP had protective effects of on glutamate-induced cell death
in HT-22 cells. Cells were plated in a 96-well plate and treated with
5 mM glutamate (Glu) and/or different concentrations of DAP. The
cells were photographed by phase-contrast microscopy after 12 h
treatment of glutamate and DAP. Representative photographs from
control, DAP (100 lM), Glu (5 mM), and Glu ? DAP groups were
shown a. Cell viability of HT-22 cells was determined by MTS assay

model and brain ischemic injury models. Our results demonstrated that DAP reduced infarct volume and improved
neurological functions in MCAO and H/I injury models
(Figs. 1 and 2). We further found that DAP protected against
glutamate toxicity-induced cell death (Fig. 3) by preserving
cellular GSH level (Fig. 4) and SOD activity (Fig. 5).

measured the cellular levels of GSH and SOD activity after
glutamate and DAP treatment. GSH is an important component of cellular antioxidant defense system against free
radical overproduction and the decreased cellular levels of
GSH impair cellular defenses against oxidative stress [24].
SOD also plays a critical role in protecting mitochondria
against superoxide anions and accelerates the dismutation
of superoxide anions into hydrogen peroxide, which is
regarded as a primary defense in preventing the generation
of free radical [20]. Previous studies also showed GSH
depletion and decreased SOD activity in glutamate-treated
HT-22 cells [10, 25]. In this study, our results clearly
indicated that DAP prevented glutamate-induced GSH
depletion and decreased SOD activity (Figs. 4 and 5).
Therefore, these findings indirectly demonstrated that DAP
may have free radical scavenging activity and further
maintain cellular GSH level and SOD activity.
DAP is a Promising Protective Agent on Stroke

Fig. 5 DAP enhanced cellular SOD activity after glutamate treatment. HT-22 cells were treated with glutamate (5 mM) and/or DAP
(100 lM) for 8 h. When the cells were collected, SOD activity was
measured by a standard assay kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. N = 6 for each group. *P \ 0.05, versus control group;

radical scavenging activity was not reported in neuronal
cells. In this study, we first tested the protective effects in a
glutamate toxicity-induced cell model. We found that DAP
had concentration-dependent protection on glutamateinduced cell death in HT-22 cells without drug toxicity
(Fig. 3). HT-22 cells lack ionotropic glutamate receptors
[21], therefore glutamate-induced cell death in HT-22 cells
was not due to glutamate excitatory toxicity, but oxidative
stress by high concentration of glutamate for blocking
glutamate-cystine transporter in the plasma membrane [18,
22]. The reduction of cystine uptake leads to GSH depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, calcium
influx, and subsequent cell death [23]. We further

123

There are increasing evidences that severe ischemic injury
causes excess glutamate release, Ca2? overload, free radicals, and inflammation, which lead to neuronal cell death
[26, 27]. Accumulative lines of evidences have shown that
oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the neuronal cell
death after cerebral ischemia [27]. Free radicals, such as
the superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, and H2O2 are elevated during stroke, but some constituents of the endogenous antioxidant system including SOD and GSH are
decreased [28]. Due to free radical scavenging activity of
DAP, we speculated that DAP may have protective effect
on cerebral ischemia injury by its anti-oxidative activity.
We examined its effects in a MCAO mouse model and an
H/I neonatal rat model. In both stroke models, DAP
treatment significantly reduced infarct volume (Figs. 1 and
2). In the MCAO model, behavioral evaluation also showed
that DAP administration also improved neurological
functions and reduced neurological scores. Therefore, DAP
was proved to be a potent agent on ischemic brain injury in
different stroke models. Since we had extensively studied
the protection of esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) in a
focal cerebral ischemia model previously, our data indicated that esculetin was effective on I/R injury even when
esculetin was administered (i.c.v.) after 4 h of reperfusion
and 75 min of ischemia [29]. DAP (7,8-dihydroxycoumarin) shares same molecular formula and similar chemical
structure with esculetin. Therefore, we further examined
protective effects of DAP post-treatment on hypoxia/
ischemia-induced brain injury in neonate rats. Our data
indicated that DAP post-treatment was still effective on H/I
injury even when it was administered (i.p.) at 4 h after
hypoxia/ischemia injury. This supported the clinical significance of DAP for the treatment of stroke.

Conclusion
We demonstrated for the first time that DAP provided
neuroprotection on cerebral ischemic injury. Because DAP
has been used for the treatment of coagulation disorder and
rheumatoid arthritis for long time with a safety profile,
DAP may be translated to use for the treatment of stroke in
the future.
