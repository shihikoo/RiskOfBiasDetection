SUMMARY
Background: Neuroactive steroids represent promising candidates for the treatment of
neurological disorders. Our previous studies identified an endogenous steroid cholestane3b, 5a, 6b-triol (Triol) as a novel neuroprotectant. Aim: We aimed to identify a potent candidate for stroke treatment through a screening of Triol analogs. Methods: Hypoxia- and
glutamate-induced neuronal injury models in vitro, middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO)-induced cerebral ischemia model in vivo, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) for alive and
propidium iodide (PI) for dead staining, LDH assay, and calcium imaging techniques were
used. Results: 24-keto-cholest-5-en-3b, 19-diol (Diol) showed the most potent neuroprotective effect among the screened structurally related compounds. FDA and PI staining
showed that Diol concentration dependently increased the survival rate of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) challenged with glutamate or hypoxia, with an effective threshold concentration of 2.5 lM. Consistently, the quantitative LDH release assay showed the same
concentration-dependent protection in both models. Diol, at 10 lM, potently decreased
glutamate- and hypoxia-induced LDH release from 51.6 to 18.2% and 62.1 to 21.7%,
respectively, which values are close to the normal LDH release (~16–18%). Moreover, we
found Diol effectively decreased MCAO-induced infarction volume in mice from ~23% to
7%, at a dose of 6 mg/kg. We further explored the underlying mechanism and found that
Diol attenuated NMDA-induced intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) increase in cortical neurons,
suggesting a negative modulatory effect on NMDA receptor. Conclusion: Taken together,
we identified Diol as a potent neuroprotectant. It may represent a novel and promising neuroprotectant for stroke intervention.

Introduction
Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter that plays
important physiological roles in the central nervous system
(CNS). However, excess release of glutamate and subsequent activation of NMDA subtype glutamate receptors induce an overwhelming calcium influx into central neurons, resulting in
neuronal injury/death. This process is associated with several neurological disorders including stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), Parkinson disease, and Alzheimer disease [1–3]. In this
regard, NMDA receptors are attractive therapeutic targets and
NMDA receptor antagonists should provide therapeutic benefits
for those neurological disorders where excessive activation of
NMDA receptors is involved. For instance, two NMDA receptor
antagonists memantine and amantadine have been successfully

approved by FDA for treatment of Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, respectively [4–6].
Neurosteroids and neuroactive steroids have various effects
on the nervous system. In particular, the rapid modulation of
neuronal excitability through interactions with ligand-gated
ion channels and other cell surface receptors attracts academic
and pharmaceutical interests recently. Neurosteroids are promising candidates for the treatment of neurological disorders
including epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and stroke [7,8]. In
a previous study, we identified an endogenous steroid cholestane-3b, 5a, 6b-triol (Triol), a metabolite of cholesterol, which
exhibited significant neuroprotective effects in multiple primary cultures in vitro and cerebral ischemia in vivo via negative modulation of NMDA receptors [9]. Triol would serve as
a promising lead compound for the development of novel and

potent neuroprotectants for stroke and other NMDA receptorrelated neurological disorders.
Based on Triol structure, we performed a preliminary screening
of structurally related compounds. We identified Diol as a more
potent neuroprotectant. Diol showed potent protective
effect against glutamate- and/or hypoxia-induced neuronal injury
in vitro and middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced ischemic
brain injury in vivo. We further demonstrated that Diol inhibited
NMDA-induced intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) increase, suggesting a negative modulatory effect on NMDA receptor. In summary,
our findings identify Diol as a potent neuroprotectant and a promising candidate for stroke treatment.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis of 24-keto-cholest-5-en-3b, 19-diol
(Diol)
Diol was synthesized starting from 3b-Acetoxy-cholest-5-en-24one, through several steps of reactions (Figure 2), using a
similar method as described previously [10]. All chemicals and
solvents were analytical grade and purchased from the Guangzhou Chemical Reagents Company (Guangzhou, Guangdong,
China). Melting points were determined on an 96 melting
point apparatus and were uncorrected. IR spectra were
recorded as KBr pellets on an EQUINOX 55 FT spectrophotometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany). 1H NMR and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity Inova 500 NB
(500 MHz) spectrometer (Palo Alto, CA, USA). Chemical shifts
were reported in values relative to TMS as the internal standard. MS data were measured on a DSQ and LCQ mass spectrometer (Suwanee, GA, USA). Flash column chromatography
was carried out with silica gel (200–300 mesh).

Neuronal Cultures and Glutamate Treatment
Primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and cortical neurons were prepared as described previously [11,12]. CGNs
were isolated and cultured from 7-day-old Sprague–Dawley rat
pups (15–19 g), and cortical neurons were isolated from brains of
fetuses (embryonic day 16). Neurons were used at 8–10 days for
CGNs and at 10–14 days for cortical neurons. Diol and MK-801
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were dissolved in DMSO as stock. For
glutamate treatment, CGNs were rinsed twice with Locke’s buffer
(134 mM NaCl, 25 mM KCl, 4 mM NaHCO3, 2.3 mM CaCl2,
5 mM D-glucose, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) and then incubated in
Locke’s buffer with or without DMSO vehicle (<0.1%), MK-801,
and different concentrations of Diol for 5 min. After that, 200 lM
glutamate and 10 lM glycine were added to vehicle, Diol, and
MK-801-treated cells and incubated for 40 min. Subsequently,
the cells were switched back to the culture medium for 24 h until
FDA and PI staining, and LDH measurements were taken.

HEPES, 20; glucose, 10, pH 7.4) and then challenged with Mg2+free ECF containing 200 lM NMDA plus 10 lM glycine for
45 min, in the presence of nimodipine (5 lM; Sigma), CNQX
(10 lM; Sigma), and TTX (0.3 lM; Alomone labs, Jerusalem,
Israel). DMSO vehicle (<0.1%), Diol, and MK-801 were applied
with NMDA (co-application) or applied after NMDA treatment
(postapplication). LDH measurements were taken at 24 h.

Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) Treatment
At day 8–10 in vitro, CGNs were switched to glucose and serumfree culture medium. 5 min before hypoxia exposure, the cultures
were treated with different concentrations of Diol (2.5, 5, 10 lM),
10 lM MK-801, and same amount of DMSO vehicle. Then, the
cultures were incubated in a hypoxic atmosphere. Hypoxic conditions (95% N2, 5% CO2, and <0.1% O2) were achieved using an
anaerobic jar equipped with a new type AnaeroPack and an indicator to monitor oxygen depletion as described previously [13].
After incubation in a hypoxic environment for 3 h at 37°C, cultures were returned to a normoxic atmosphere at 37°C for 24 h
(reoxygenation). Normal cultures were maintained under standard incubation conditions.

Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) Alive and Propidium
Iodide (PI) Dead Staining
At 24 h following glutamate or hypoxia treatment, the viability of
CGNs was assessed by PI and FDA staining as described previously
[11]. Briefly, CGNs were incubated in standard extracellular solution with addition of 2 lM PI and 5 lM FDA for 15 min followed
by wash with standard extracellular solution. PI-positive and
FDA-positive cells were viewed on a microscope (Zeiss) equipped
with epifluorescence at 580/630 nm excitation/emission for PI
and 500/550 nm for FDA. The numbers of neurons from 4–5 random fields were counted by a blinded observer and normalized to
normal control for FDA staining, and glutamate or hypoxia treatment for PI staining.

Detection of Chromatin Condensation
Chromatin condensation was detected by nucleus staining with
Hoechst33258 as described previously [12]. Briefly, at 24 h after
glutamate or hypoxia treatment, the cells plated onto poly-Llysine-coated 6-well chamber slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at 4°C. Then, the cells were washed
twice with PBS and incubated with Hoechst33258 (5 mg/L) for
10 min at room temperature in the dark. Stained nuclei were
visualized with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope at a 640
magnification with an excitation wavelength of 355–366 nm and
an emission wavelength of 465–480 nm. In this way, apoptotic
CGNs would be stained into bright blue because of their chromatin condensation.

NMDA Treatment

LDH Assay

Cortical neurons at 10–14 days were used. Briefly, cortical neurons were rinsed twice with normal extracellular fluid (ECF
composition, in mM: NaCl, 140; KCl, 5.4; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 2;

Neuronal injury was quantified by measurement of LDH release
in the culture medium using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) as described previously [14].

A Synthetic Steroid Functions as Neuroprotectant

Supernatant (50 lL) was transferred from the culture wells to a
96-well plate. Cells were then lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 for
30 min at 37°C. Then, 50 lL supernatants were transferred from
each well for maximal LDH measurement. 50 lL assay reagent
from cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Diagnostics) was added to
each sample and mixed. 30 min later, the absorbance at 492 and
620 nm was examined by spectrometer (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular devices), and the values of the absorbance at 492 nm were
subtracted by those at 620 nm to yield the value of LDH release.
The LDH release is presented as the ratio of supernatant LDH
(minus background absorbance) versus the maximal LDH release
(minus background absorbance).

Focal Ischemia
Transient focal ischemia was induced by suture occlusion of the
middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 1 h as described previously
[15]. Ischemia was induced by introducing a coated filament from
the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery to the
branching point of the left MCA. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37°C  0.5°C with a thermostatically controlled heating
pad and lamp. Cerebral blood flow was monitored by transcranial
LASER doppler. Animals with blood flow not reduced below 15%
were excluded. Reperfusion was accomplished by withdrawing
the suture after 1 h of ischemia. Diol (6 mg/kg) was administrated
through caudal vein injection 15 min prior MCAO. Animals were
killed with 10% chloral hydrate 24 h after ischemia. Brains were
rapidly removed, coronally sectioned at 1-mm intervals starting
2 mm posterior to the frontal pole to yield five coronal slices,
stained by immersion, incubated in 1.0% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37°C for 30 min, and fixed in 4.0% paraformaldehyde solution. Infarct volume was calculated by summing
infarction areas of all sections and multiplying by slice thickness.
All manipulations and analyses were performed by individuals
blinded to treatment groups. All experimental procedures on live
mice were performed according to the guidelines for the care and
use of laboratory animals as published by Sun Yat-sen University
(Guangzhou, China).

Measurement of Intracellular Calcium
The intracellular calcium level in cortical neurons was measured
using a Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye, fura-2-acetoxymethyl
ester. Briefly, Cortical neurons at 10–14 days grown on
25 9 25 mm glass coverslips were washed three times with normal extracellular fluid (ECF) (ECF composition, in mM: NaCl,
140; KCl, 5.4; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 2; HEPES, 20; glucose, 10, pH 7.4).
Then, the cells were incubated in ECF with 5 lM fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester for 30 min in the dark, followed by three times of
wash with ECF and kept in the dark for additional 30 min until
Ca2+ measurement. Ca2+ measurement was performed in the
presence of nimodipine (5 lM; Sigma), CNQX (10 lM; Sigma),
and TTX (0.3 lM; Alomone labs). The fluorescence signal was
monitored and recorded by a cooled CCD camera (Sensys KAF
1401, Photometrics). Digital images were acquired and analyzed
by Axon Imaging Workbench software 6.0 (Axon Instruments,
Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The shutter and filter wheel (Lambda 10–2)
were controlled by the software to allow timed illumination of

488

cells at 340 or 380 nm excitation wavelengths. Fura-2 fluorescence was detected at emission wavelength of 510 nm. Ratio
images (340/380) were analyzed by averaging pixel ratio values in
circumscribed regions of cells in the field of view. Sigmaplot 8.0
was used for further analysis.

Statistical Analysis
Results were expressed as mean  SEM Significant differences
between groups were determined by Student’s t-test and one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was set at
*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01.

Results
Effects of a Series of Triol Analogs on
Glutamate-Induced Neuronal Injury
Based on cholestane-3b, 5a, 6b-triol (Triol) structure, we screened
a series of structurally related compounds (Figure 1) in a glutamate-induced neuronal injury model in vitro aimed at identifying
a potent neuroprotectant. As Triol exerted significant neuroprotective effect at 10 lM, we compared all the analogs at the same
concentration. As shown in Table 1, some compounds including E
and L slightly increased glutamate-induced LDH release due to a
potential toxicity effect (>54.6%). In contrast, other compounds
including Triol, G-K, significantly decreased LDH release, indicating neuroprotective effects. Among all compounds, Diol showed
the most potent neuroprotective effect. It decreased glutamateinduced LDH release from 53.4 to 19.0%.

CGNs were rinsed and treated with 10 lM different compounds for 5 min
in locke solution. Then, the neurons were exposed to 200 lM glutamate
in the presence of 10 lM glycine for 40 min. Subsequently, the neurons
were rinsed and switched back to the normal culture medium. LDH release

injury in CGNs. Exposure of cultured CGNs to glutamate results in
morphological changes, including shrunken cell bodies and broken dendrites (Figure 3A). Dead staining with propidium iodide
(PI, red, Figure 3B) and alive staining with fluorescein diacetate
(FDA, green, Figure 3C) show an increased dead and decreased
living cell number, respectively, after glutamate treatment. Moreover, Hoechst33258 staining showed that the nuclei of some CGNs
treated were condensed and stained into brightly blue after glutamate challenge, suggesting apoptosis occurred (Figure 3D). Diol
significantly decreased the apoptotic cell numbers. Pretreatment
of CGNs with Diol for 5 min prior to glutamate exposure concentration dependently decreased the number of dead cell (% PI-positive cells) and increased the number of survival cell (% FDApositive cells) of CGNs (Figure 4E). Quantitative LDH release
assay further confirmed the neuroprotective effect of Diol (Figure 4F). Diol, at 10 lM, decreased glutamate-induced LDH release
to a level close to the normal release. MK-801 was used as a positive control.

Neuroprotective Effect of Diol Against Hypoxia/
reoxygenation (H/R)-Induced Neuronal injury in
vitro
To mimic the ischemic conditions in stroke, we used a hypoxia
model to further evaluate the neuroprotective effect of Diol in
CGNs. Consistent with those findings observed in the glutamateinduced excitotoxicity model, Diol exerted a similar and potent
neuroprotective effect against hypoxia-induced neuronal injury.
Exposure of cultured CGNs to 3 h hypoxia results in morphological changes, including shrunken cell bodies and loss of dendrites

(Figure 4A), increased cell death (PI staining, Figure 4B), and
decreased cell viability (FDA staining, Figure 4C). In addition, as
shown in Figure 4D, the nuclei of most CGNs treated with H/R
were condensed, which demonstrated that hypoxia induced
apoptosis in CGNs. Diol exerted potent neuroprotective effects
against H/R-induced neuronal death/apoptosis (Figure 4B–E). It
decreased H/R-induced LDH release in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 4F).

Neuroprotective Effect of Diol against Cerebral
Ischemia Injury in vivo
We used the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
model in mice to further evaluate the neuroprotective effect of
Diol in cerebral ischemia. As shown in Figure 5A, transient
MCAO leads to a large infarct volume in the ipsilateral hemisphere in mice. The infarct volume induced by MCAO was
24.1  1.71% for the vehicle-treated group (Figure 5B). IV
administration of 6 mg/kg Diol significantly reduced the infarction volume to 6.81  1.08% (Figure 5B). Together, these data
demonstrated that neuronal injury induced by MCAO was markedly reduced by Diol.

Diol Inhibits NMDA-Induced [Ca2+]i Increase in
Cortical Neurons
Increased extracellular glutamate level leads to the activation of
Ca2+ permeable NMDA receptors and subsequent calcium overload, which is a predominant mechanism for glutamate-mediated
excitotoxicity. As Diol potently protected against glutamate-mediated neuronal toxicity, we asked whether Diol could decrease
NMDA receptor-mediated calcium overload. As shown in Figure 6A, bath application of 200 lM NMDA in cultures induced a
remarkable and sustained [Ca2+]i increase. Co-application of
10 lM Diol significantly reduced the increased [Ca2+]i level
(Figure 6A-B).

Neuroprotective Effect of Diol against NMDAInduced Neuronal Injury in vitro
To provide more evidence on the mechanism involved in the neuroprotective effect of Diol, we examined the effect of Diol on
NMDA-induced neuronal injury. Exposure of the cultured cortical
neurons to 200 lM NMDA for 45 min resulted in an increased
LDH release significantly (Figure 7). Co-application of 10 lM Diol
with NMDA or 10 lM MK-801 with NMDA significantly
decreased NMDA-induced LDH release. However, no significant
neuroprotective effects were observed, when Diol and MK-801
were applied after NMDA treatment (Figure 7).

Discussion
Neurosteroids or neuroactive steroids are endogenous steroids
derived from cholesterol or steroidal precursors that can rapidly
alter neuronal excitability through a direct modulation of the
functions of ion channels or membrane receptors [7,16].
Accumulating evidence proves that steroids have nongenomic
effects; for example, several neurosteroids could positively or neg-

atively modulate GABAA and NMDA receptors [9,17–20]. These
rapid and non-genomic effects have attracted much interest in the
past few decades, which make steroids promising candidates for
the treatment of neurological disorders implicated with ion channel dysfunction [21,22]. Our previous study identified Triol, a
metabolite of cholesterol, as an endogenous neuroprotectant via
negative modulation of NMDA receptors. Triol not only would
serve as a pharmacological tool for the investigation of NMDA
receptor functions, but also provides an important lead compound
for the development of novel neuroprotectant.
The polyhydroxy structure seems critical for the neuroprotective effect of Triol, because the precursors of Triol, including
cholesterol, cholesterol 5a,6a-epoxide and cholesterol 5b,6bepoxide, exerted no neuroprotective effect under the same
conditions. Other cholesterol metabolites including 27hydroxycholesterol and 24-ketocholesterol also showed no neuroprotective effect, which further confirmed the importance of
polyhydroxy group for Diol’s neuroprotective effect. The slight
structure modification at 24-carbon on the side chain results in
compound G did not alter the neuroprotective effect, whereas
the replacement of the side chain with a bulky group as in compound H caused a significant decrease in activity. Interestingly,
the introduction of a hydroxyl group at 19-C, for example, in
24-keto-cholest-5-en-3b, 19-diol (Diol), significantly enhanced
neuroprotective potency. A large-scale SAR study would help to
design and develop a simplified analog, while retaining the efficacy. Diol is a polyhydroxylated sterol, with a terminal keto
group on the side chain. We synthesized Diol starting from 3b-

ª 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

Acetoxy-cholest-5-en-24-one and confirmed its structure with
multiple spectroscopic data. For example, the appearance of 13C
NMR peak at 71.41 (3-CH) and 62.75 (19-CH2) indicated the
formation of 3b, 19-Diol, and the spectra of 13C NMR peak at
215.49 (24-C) and IR at 1709 cm 1 supported the existence of a
terminal keto group.
Excessive activation of NMDA receptors results in intracellular
calcium overload. Calcium plays a central role in several
pathological processes, particularly in NMDA-type glutamate
receptor-mediated neuronal injury [23]. In the current study, we
found Diol decreased NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i increase to a moderate level, which suggests that inhibition of NMDA receptor might
be one of the underlying mechanisms. We further confirmed this
mechanism using a NMDA-mediated neuronal injury model in
the presence of a combination of channel inhibitors including
CNQX (non-NMDA glutamate receptor inhibitor), TTX (voltagegated sodium channel inhibitor), and nimodipine (L-type voltagegated calcium channel inhibitor). We found both Diol and
MK-801 protected cortical neurons when they were co-applied
with NMDA, whereas no significant neuroprotective effects were
observed when they were applied after NMDA treatment. This
finding in combination with the calcium imaging result suggests
that NMDA receptor might be a critical target of Diol.
The NMDA receptor is strongly implicated in the acute neurotoxicity in stroke, and NMDA receptor antagonists show significant neuroprotective effect in multiple preclinical models.
Unfortunately, the clinical tests of NMDA antagonists for
neuroprotection failed in clinical trials for stroke treatment [24].

A Synthetic Steroid Functions as Neuroprotectant

The failure is mainly attributable to the intolerable side effects
such as disruption of cognition, leading to psychotomimetic
effects, and limited short therapeutic time window. NMDA receptor subtype may mediate beneficial or deleterious effects depending on the subtypes and the distribution in different subcellular
compartments. For example, deleterious effects can be mediated
by over activation of extrasynaptic receptors containing GluN2B
subunits [24], and thus, NR2B represents a promising target for
stoke. It is needed to explore the subunit selectivity of Diol on
NMDA receptors in the future. Moreover, the neuroprotective
effect of Diol in MCAO model was achieved by pretreatment in
the current study, which remains to be examined in a wide range
of time window. Particularly, the therapeutic animal studies are
required to test the effects of poststroke administration of Diol.
In summary, we have provided evidence supporting that Diol, a
synthetic steroid, functions as a novel neuroprotectant through
inhibition of NMDA receptor. We speculate that the neuroprotec-

could also be extended to other neurological disorders where
overstimulation of NMDA receptors plays an etiological role.
