injury by enhancing cell apoptosis after ischemic stroke.

INTRODUCTION
Stroke is the second largest contributor to human
mortality and the leading cause of disability worldwide
(Donnan et al., 2008; Floel et al., 2011; Lucke-Wold
et al., 2012). Ischemic stroke, which occurs as a result
of an obstruction within a vessel supplying blood to the
brain, is the most prominent type of stroke and main
cause of long-term disability (Montaner et al., 2012). It
is widely accepted that age is the major risk factor for
stroke, with a profound impact on clinical outcome. Previous studies have reported that ischemic stroke leads to
earlier disruption of the blood–brain barrier into small molecules, larger infarction volume, increased neuronal
degeneration, higher mortality rate, and poorer functional
recovery in aged animals, compared with younger animals (Rosen et al., 2005; DiNapoli et al., 2006, 2008;
Tan et al., 2009). However, the mechanisms underlying
the age-related exacerbated ischemic brain injury remain
unclear. Currently available treatments for acute ischemic
stroke are limited to thrombolytics such as recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Although tPA drastically improves stroke outcome when used within the suggested time period, only a small percentage (<3%) of
people with ischemic stroke receive tPA due to increased
risk of secondary cerebral hemorrhage and edema formation (Katzan et al., 2004). Thus, with an aging population,
it is urgent to explore alternative approaches for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke.
Numerous studies have shown that brief application of
volatile anesthetic agents before the onset of ischemia, a
procedure known as anesthetic preconditioning, can
protect against brain ischemia–reperfusion injury (Payne
et al., 2005; Codaccioni et al., 2009; Li and Zuo, 2009;
Adamczyk et al., 2010). Since preconditioning requires
timely planning, it may not be suitable for emergency

Abstract—Aging is associated with exacerbated brain injury
after ischemic stroke. Herein, we explored the possible
mechanisms underlying the age-associated exacerbated
brain injury after ischemic stroke and determined whether
therapeutic intervention with anesthetic post-conditioning
would provide neuroprotection in aged rats. Male Fisher
344 rats (young, 4 months; aged, 24 months) underwent
2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed
by 24-h reperfusion, with or without sevoﬂurane post-conditioning for 15 min immediately at the onset of reperfusion.
Compared with young rats, aged rats showed larger infarct
size, worse neurological scores and more TUNEL-positive
cells in the penumbral cerebral cortex at 24 h after MCAO.
However, edema formation and motor coordination were
similar in both groups. Sevoﬂurane reduced the infarct size,
edema formation, and TUNEL-positive cells, and improved
the neurological outcome in young rats but not in aged rats.
Molecular studies revealed that basal expression of the antiapoptotic molecule B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in the brain
was lower in aged rats compared with young rats before
MCAO, while basal expression of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) showed similar levels
in both groups. MCAO reduced Bcl-2 expression and
increased Bax expression in both groups; however, Bax
increase was more pronounced in aged rats. In young rats,
sevoﬂurane reversed the above MCAO-induced changes.
In contrast, sevoﬂurane failed to enhance Bcl-2 expression
but decreased Bax expression in aged rats. These ﬁndings
suggest that aging-associated reduction in basal Bcl-2

situations. An alternative to preconditioning could be the
immediate and short-term use of volatile anesthetic
agents upon organ reperfusion, a process deﬁned as
anesthetic post-conditioning (Adamczyk et al., 2010;
Robin et al., 2011). Recent studies in multiple animal
models have demonstrated that anesthetic post-conditioning with isoﬂurane or sevoﬂurane improves shortand long-term neurological outcomes after ischemic
stroke (Lee et al., 2008; Adamczyk et al., 2010; Li et al.,
2013b). However, most studies investigating the neuroprotective eﬀects of anesthetic post-conditioning have
been conducted in young healthy animals, although
elderly people are most susceptible to ischemic stroke
(Schmidt et al., 2012), and age-related changes in the
brain have been demonstrated (Lucke-Wold et al., 2012).
It is therefore unclear whether advanced age aﬀects the
anesthetic post-conditioning-induced neuroprotection.
Accordingly, the present study aimed to explore the
possible mechanisms underlying the age-associated
exacerbated brain injury after ischemic stroke and
evaluate the neuroprotective eﬀects of anesthetic
sevoﬂurane post-conditioning in aged rats.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Young adult (4 months) and aged (24 months) male
Fisher 344 rats were purchased from Vital River
Laboratories (Beijing, China) and housed under 12-h
light–12-h dark conditions with food and water available
ad libitum. All experimental procedures and protocols
used in this study were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at the Shandong
University and were performed in accordance with the
‘‘Guiding Principles for Research Involving Animals and
Human Beings’’.
Experimental protocol
The experimental design is illustrated in Fig. 1. Rats were
randomly assigned to 4 groups (n = 19 for each group)
as follows: (1) young adult rats with ischemia–
reperfusion alone (young control: Y-Con); (2) young

adult rats with ischemia–reperfusion and sevoﬂurane
post-conditioning (Y-Sev); (3) aged rats with ischemia–
reperfusion alone (aged control: A-Con); (4) aged rats
with ischemia–reperfusion and sevoﬂurane postconditioning (A-Sev). After a 30-min stabilization period,
these rats were subjected to 2 h of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24-h reperfusion.
Rats assigned to post-conditioning were put in the gastight anesthesia chamber and exposed for 15 min to
sevoﬂurane at a concentration of 2.6% immediately at
the onset of reperfusion. A gas analyzer was connected
to the chamber to monitor and maintain the
concentrations of inspired oxygen and sevoﬂurane
constantly. Rats assigned to control groups were also
placed in the same chamber with only room air. Rectal
body temperature was maintained at 37 °C by a
warming blanket and lamps during MCAO and postconditioning. The dose for sevoﬂurane was based on
previous studies showing such dose of sevoﬂurane
produced optimal neuroprotective actions in vivo in rats
(Adamczyk et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013a). At the end of
the protocol (24 h after ischemia), neurological deﬁcit
scores and motor coordination were evaluated. Rats were
then sacriﬁced and the brains were removed for assessment of infarct volume, detection of cell apoptosis or analysis of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) related anti- and proapoptotic members.
To examine age-related diﬀerence in basal level of
Bcl-2-related anti- and pro-apoptotic members,
additional brains were obtained from young adult and
aged rats (n = 6 for each group) before MCAO in order
to perform molecular analysis of basal Bcl-2-related
members. The animal numbers used for each
experiment are shown in Table 1.

Induction of MCAO
Ischemic stroke was induced by MCAO with subsequent
reperfusion as previously described (Li et al., 2013a).
Brieﬂy, rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate
(300 mg kg 1) intraperitoneally. A 4/0 surgical nylon
monoﬁlament with a rounded tip was introduced into the
internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery and

gently advanced until slight resistance was felt at approximately 18.0 ± 0.5 mm from the carotid bifurcation. After
2 h of occlusion, the monoﬁlament was gently removed
to allow reperfusion for 24 h.
The right femoral artery was also cannulated for
measurement of systemic hemodynamics and arterial
blood gas. Hemodynamic parameters, including BP and
HR, were analyzed immediately before ischemia, 15 and
35 min after the onset of ischemia, and 5 and 15 min
after the onset of reperfusion. Arterial blood gas was
analyzed 15 min after the onset of ischemia or
reperfusion. After recovery from anesthesia, the animals
were placed back in their cages with free access to food
and water.

Evaluation of ischemic brain injury
An eight-point scale was used to evaluate neurological
deﬁcit scores at 24 h after ischemia as described
previously (Rogers et al., 1997; Li and Zuo, 2009; Li
et al., 2013a). The score 0, no apparent deﬁcits; score
1, failure to extend left forepaw fully; score 2, decreased
grip of the left forelimb; score 3, spontaneous movement
in all directions, contralateral circling only if pulled by the
tail; score 4, circling or walking to the left; score 5, walking
only if stimulated; score 6, unresponsiveness to stimulation and with depressed level of consciousness; and
score 7, dead.
Motor coordination was evaluated 24 h after ischemia
as described previously (Mizoguchi et al., 2002; Li et al.,
2013a). Brieﬂy, the time that the rats spent on a rotating
rod was recorded in each case for up to 180 s. Each rat
was tested ﬁve times and the average riding time was
used as the mean value for this test. When the time of riding was over 180 s, the rat was released from the rod, and
the riding time was calculated as 180 s.
At the end of the observation period, rats were
euthanized and brains were quickly removed for
assessment of infarct volume or edema index as
previously described (Maier et al., 1998; Tan et al.,
2009; Arrick et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013a). Brieﬂy, brains
were sectioned coronally at 2-mm intervals. Sections

were then incubated in 2% 2,3,5 triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) for 15 min at 37 °C. Section images were
digitalized and infarct areas were analyzed using NIH
Image 1.60. The Complete lack of staining with TTC
was deﬁned as the infarct lesion. The total infarct volume
was expressed as a percentage of the contralateral hemisphere. Edema index was calculated according to the following formula: edema index = (RV LV) / LV  100%,
where RV was the volume of the right hemisphere
(mm3) and LV was the volume of the left hemisphere
(mm3).
Apoptosis detection with the TUNEL assay
TUNEL assay for cell apoptosis was performed using
in situ cell death detection kit (Roche, Nonnenwald,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Brieﬂy, the brain sections were ﬁxed by formaldehyde,
and endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with
3% H2O2 in methanol. The sections were then
incubated with reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °C and
the signals were visualized with DAB reagent. The
positively TUNEL-stained cells at the ischemic
penumbral region were counted in 5 sections from one
rat and the average was used for quantitative analysis.
Real-time PCR analysis of Bcl-2-related anti- and
pro-apoptotic members
The mRNA expression of anti-apoptotic molecular Bcl-2
and pro-apoptotic molecular Bcl-2-associated X protein
(Bax) in the cerebral cortex tissue from rats that were
not subjected to MCAO (for analysis of basal Bcl-2 and
Bax expression) or ischemic penumbral region of the
cerebral cortex tissue from rats 24 h after MCAO were
measured with real-time PCR. The total RNA was
extracted using TRI Reagent (Molecular Research
Center, Inc) and reverse transcribed into cDNA. The
levels for Bcl-2, Bax and GAPDH mRNA were measured
with SYBR green real-time PCR. The sequences for
primers used were as follows: Bcl-2 (L14680), TCTGTG
GATGACTGAGTACCTGAAC (forward) and AGAGAC
AGCCAGGAGAAATCAAAC (reverse); Bax (NM 017059),

CTCGGGCACTTTAG (reverse); GAPDH (AF106860),
AAGGTCATCCCAGAGCTGAA (forward) and ATGTAG

performed using the ABI prism 7000 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA). The values
were normalized to GAPDH and expressed as a fold
change relative to the basal value in young adult group.
Western blot analysis of Bcl-2-related anti- and
pro-apoptotic members
The protein levels of anti-apoptotic molecular Bcl-2 and
pro-apoptotic molecular Bax in the cerebral cortex tissue
from rats that were not subjected to MCAO (for analysis
of basal Bcl-2 and Bax expression) or ischemic
penumbral region of the cerebral cortex tissue from rats
24 h after MCAO were measured by Western blot. The
cortical tissue was dissected from the coronal brain
sections and homogenized in lysis buﬀer. The protein
concentration in the supernatant was measured using
the BCA protein assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Equivalent amounts of protein were separated on 12%
SDS–polyacrylamide
gels
and
transferred
to
polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride
membranes
(Millipore
Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA). The membranes were
blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and then incubated
using primary antibody to Bcl-2 (1:200, sc-7382), Bax
(1:500, sc-7480) and b-actin (1:500, sc-7210; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C
overnight. After three washing, the membranes were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
second antibody (1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc,
Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. The signal
was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) detection system (Amersham) and the densities
of the immunobands were quantitated. All data were
corrected and normalized to b-actin.

that all twelve rats had severe brain infarction and
edema. Thus, infarct size, edema formation and
neurological functions were assessed at 24 h after
MCAO and reperfusion in all rats that survived the
observation period. Fig. 2 shows representative TTCstained brain sections from each experimental group.
Infarct volumes at 24 h after MCAO and reperfusion
were greater in aged control rats than in young adult
control rats (Fig. 3A). Anesthetic post-conditioning with
sevoﬂurane signiﬁcantly reduced total infarct volume by
34% in young adult rats, whereas it failed to protect
aged animals against cerebral infarction (Fig. 3A).
Of note, edema formation at 24 h after MCAO and
reperfusion was similar between young adult and aged
control rats (Fig. 3B). Compared with the corresponding
control groups, sevoﬂurane post-conditioning signiﬁcantly
decreased edema formation in young adult rats, in
contrast to aged animals.
Eﬀect of sevoﬂurane post-conditioning on
neurological function
Fig. 4A shows the neurological severity scores.
Compared with young adult controls, aged control rats
displayed markedly increased neurological scores at
24 h after MCAO and reperfusion. As shown above for
edema formation, sevoﬂurane post-conditioning signiﬁcantly
reduced neurological scores in young adult animals, but
showed no eﬀect in aged rats.
Twenty-four hours after MCAO and reperfusion, no
diﬀerence in time spent on rotarod was observed
between young adult and aged control rats (Fig. 4B).

statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
Eﬀect of sevoﬂurane post-conditioning on infarct
size and edema formation
In this study, multiple measurements were carried out and
some assays could not be performed on the same rats or
brain tissues. Additionally, based on previous report (Tan
et al., 2009) and our experience, a mortality rate of >30%
at 24 h after MCAO and reperfusion could be observed in
aged rats. We therefore used a high number of animals to
ensure that the animals survived until the end of each
experiment would be enough for statistical analysis.
During the 24-h observation period, 5 young adult rats
(3 from Y-Con; 2 from Y-Sev) and 7 aged rats (4 from
A-Con; 3 from A-Sev) died (Table 1). Necropsy showed

time on rotarod in young adult rats as compared to young
controls. However, this strategy failed to improve the
performance of aged rats.
Eﬀect of sevoﬂurane post-conditioning on apoptosis
The TUNEL assay is a common method for detecting
programed cell death. As shown in Fig. 5, TUNELpositive cells were observed in the penumbral cerebral
cortex of rats from all groups at 24 h after MCAO and
reperfusion. However, more TUNEL-positive cells were
observed in aged control rats than in young
counterparts. Sevoﬂurane post-conditioning signiﬁcantly
reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells in young
adult rats but not in aged animals.
Expression of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins
Figs. 6 and 7 show the expression of Bcl-2 and Bax at
baseline (before MCAO) and 24 h after MCAO and
reperfusion. The mRNA and protein levels of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 (Figs. 6A and 7B) were
signiﬁcantly lower in aged rats compared with young
adult animals at baseline, whereas mRNA and protein
levels of the pro-apoptotic factor Bax (Figs. 6B and 7C)
were similar between both groups at baseline.
As expected, Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels were
markedly reduced in both young adult and aged control

rats at 24 h after MCAO and reperfusion, compared to
respective baseline values. Interestingly, sevoﬂurane
post-conditioning in young adult rats induced signiﬁcant
increases in Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expression,
compared with respective controls; these eﬀects were
not observed in aged rats (Figs. 6A and 7B).
As for Bax, the mRNA and protein levels were
markedly augmented in both young adult and aged
control rats at 24 h after MCAO and reperfusion,
compared to respective baseline values. Notably, the
increase in Bax mRNA and protein levels was more
pronounced in aged control rats compared with young
counterparts. Sevoﬂurane post-conditioning signiﬁcantly
reduced Bax gene and protein expression in both young
adult and aged rats compared with their respective
control groups. However, Bax expression was still
higher in aged rats compared with young adult animals
after sevoﬂurane post-conditioning (Figs. 6B and 7C).
Hemodynamic and physiological variables
To eliminate confounding factors that might aﬀect
neurological outcomes, hemodynamic and physiological
variables, including BP, HR and arterial blood gases,
were monitored and controlled before, during and after
focal cerebral ischemia. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
mean BP, HR, arterial pH, carbon dioxide tension (Pco2)

The present study provides the following novel ﬁndings:
(1) decreased anti-apoptotic member Bcl-2 expression
at baseline is associated with enhanced cell apoptosis
and contributes to increased brain injury in aged rats
after ischemic stroke; (2) sevoﬂurane post-conditioning
fails to confer neuroprotection in aged rats, probably
due to its inability to eﬀectively increase Bcl-2
expression for the prevention of apoptosis in the brain.
Aging is a multifaceted process associated with
various functional and structural deﬁcits in the brain.
The eﬀects of age on brain injury and neurological
outcome have been previously reported (Rosen et al.,
2005; DiNapoli et al., 2006, 2008; Tan et al., 2009). In
the present study, we demonstrated that aged rats exhibit
larger infarct size and worse functional deﬁcits compared
with young adult rats. These results are consistent with
other studies (Rosen et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2009), indicating that aged brain is more susceptible to ischemic
injury. The mechanism by which aging increases ischemic
brain injury remains unclear. Although age-related changes
in vascular anatomy or function are known to be associated with the extent of ischemic brain injury (DiNapoli
et al., 2008; Lucke-Wold et al., 2012), these alterations
may not be the sole reason for the diﬀerence observed
in ischemic brain injury between aged and young adult
rats. Indeed, other factors, such as enhanced expression
of proinﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines, increased

oxidative stress and reduced cell survival after ischemic
stroke, have been suggested to contribute to increased
ischemic brain injury in aged animals (DiNapoli et al.,
2010; Lucke-Wold et al., 2012). In addition, recent studies
in various neural injury models utilizing aged animals
have demonstrated an increase in apoptotic cell death,
which was attributed to inﬂammatory processes and
increased oxidative stress (Popa-Wagner et al., 2010;
Lucke-Wold et al., 2012; Itoh et al., 2013). Apoptosis is
one of the major mechanisms of cell death after cerebral
ischemia and reperfusion (Broughton et al., 2009).
Apoptosis is known to be mediated by members of the
Bcl-2 family of proteins, which possess either pro- or
anti-apoptotic activities (Brunelle and Letai, 2009). These
proteins regulate the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by
controlling the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial
membrane (Brunelle and Letai, 2009). Many types of
stress or damage may cause the activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax in the mitochondrion. Activated
Bax participates in the formation of pores in the outer
mitochondrial membrane through which pro-apoptotic

molecules escape, including cytochrome c, which leads
to morphological characteristics of apoptosis (Brunelle
and Letai, 2009). Meanwhile, expression of Bcl-2 or
related anti-apoptotic proteins block cell death in
response to many varieties of insult by preventing the
activation and homo-oligomerization of Bax and other
pro-apoptotic proteins (Brunelle and Letai, 2009). Interestingly, a striking age-related decrease in Bcl-2 expression in the brain was reported (Almeida et al., 2000; Li
et al., 2011). In contrast, Bax expression was maintained
at similar levels in the brain of both young and aged animals (Almeida et al., 2000; Li et al., 2011). Our current
study showed that Bcl-2 expression at baseline was signiﬁcantly lower in aged rats, compared with young adult
animals, while similar expression of Bax at baseline was
observed in both groups. These ﬁndings conﬁrmed previously reported data. Twenty-four hours after MCAO and
reperfusion, Bcl-2 expression was reduced, while that of
Bax was augmented in both young adult and aged control
rats, compared to respective baseline values. These
results are consistent with previous reports showing that
cerebral ischemia and reperfusion decreases the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, while increasing pro-apoptotic protein levels (Li et al., 2012; Geng et al., 2013).
Moreover, we found that the change in Bcl-2 expression
after MCAO and reperfusion was concomitant with a more
pronounced increase in Bax expression and more TUNEL-positive cells in the penumbral cerebral cortex of aged
control rats, compared with young adult controls. These
observations suggested that aged brain may have lower
threshold to apoptotic stimuli due to decreased Bcl-2
expression at baseline. In addition, the neurons in the
aged brain may be more inclined to die by apoptosis: very
low levels of anti-apoptotic proteins may be insuﬃcient to
prevent activated pro-apoptotic proteins in response to
cerebral ischemia.
Numerous studies in animals and humans have
clearly demonstrated the capacity of anesthetic pre- or
post-conditioning to protect organs against ischemic
injury, including the brain and the heart (Payne et al.,
2005; Li et al., 2008; Codaccioni et al., 2009; Adamczyk
et al., 2010; Song et al., 2011; Jazbutyte et al., 2012;
Lang et al., 2013). The eﬀect of aging on cardioprotection
induced by anesthetic pre- or post-conditioning has been
extensively investigated in both clinical and experimental
studies. However, whether these strategies can attenuate
ischemic brain injury in aged animals or elderly patients
has not been previously reported. Herein, we demonstrated that post-conditioning with sevoﬂurane signiﬁcantly reduced cerebral ischemia–reperfusion-induced
infarct size, decreased edema formation and improved
neurologic outcome in young adult rats. These results
conﬁrm previous reports showing neuroprotective eﬀects
of anesthetic post-conditioning in young adult animals
(Lee et al., 2008; Adamczyk et al., 2010; Li et al.,
2013b). More importantly, these beneﬁcial eﬀects were
not observed in aged rats, demonstrating for the ﬁrst time
that aging alters sevoﬂurane post-conditioning-induced
neuroprotection. The lack of neuroprotection observed
in aged rats could not solely be attributed to increased
ischemic brain injury. Indeed, a previous study (Drenger

P. Dong et al. / Neuroscience 275 (2014) 2–11

et al., 2011) has demonstrated that diabetic rats exhibited
infarct size similar to that of control rats after myocardial
ischemia. However, sevoﬂurane post-conditioning signiﬁcantly reduced myocardial infarct size in control rats but
not in diabetic animals. Interestingly, more recent studies
have shown that sevoﬂurane post-conditioning protected
against focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury by
modulating Bcl-2 and Bax expression (Wang et al.,
2010; Jeon et al., 2013). Bcl-2 up-regulation and/or Bax
down-regulation may result in decreased cytochrome c
release from mitochondria and reduced cell apoptosis in
the ischemic penumbra of adult rats after MCAO, and
contribute to neuroprotection (Li et al., 2008; Li and
Zuo, 2009). In agreement, the data presented herein
showed that sevoﬂurane post-conditioning signiﬁcantly
increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased Bax levels in
the penumbral cerebral cortex of young adult rats 24 h following MCAO and reperfusion. Consequently, this area
showed reduced cell apoptosis. In aged rats, sevoﬂurane
post-conditioning did not alter Bcl-2 expression but significantly decreased Bax levels in the penumbral cerebral
cortex. However, the reduced Bax expression did not
result in decreased cell apoptosis in aged rats. These
ﬁndings suggest that expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, but not the pro-apoptotic factor Bax, may play a
crucial role in the sevoﬂurane post-conditioning-induced
neuroprotection. Indeed, a previous study has reported
that anesthetic isoﬂurane pre-conditioning did not alter
Bax expression, but resulted in increased Bcl-2 expression in the penumbral cerebral cortex, which was accompanied by reduced cell apoptosis as well as decreased
brain injury in rats after ischemic stroke (Li et al., 2008).
It has also been reported that cells depend upon Bcl-2
and other anti-apoptotic proteins for survival, and molecular intervention targeted to anti-apoptotic proteins, such
as Bcl-2, can induce apoptosis in cancer cells (Brunelle
and Letai, 2009). Thus, the lack of enhanced Bcl-2 expression by sevoﬂurane post-conditioning probably contributed
to the failure of this strategy to protect against ischemic
brain injury in aged rats. The mechanisms underlying the
failure of sevoﬂurane post-conditioning to increase Bcl-2
expression in the brain of aged rats remain unclear. It
was reported that Bcl-2 expression is mediated by signal
transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) and
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Indeed, activation of STAT3 increases Bcl-2 expression (Alas et al.,
2001), while p38 MAPK inhibition blocks the STAT3induced increase in Bcl-2 expression (Vega et al., 2004).
Further studies are needed to determine whether STAT3
or p38 MAPK signaling is impaired by aging.
Our study focused on the role of Bcl-2 and Bax in
sevoﬂurane post-conditioning-induced neuro-protection.
However, other mechanisms may be involved as well.
For example, oxidative stress was shown to play an
important role in brain ischemia–reperfusion injury (Song
et al., 2008). Indeed, the aging brain generally displays
increased oxidative stress (Guest et al., 2014), and
ischemia–reperfusion can further augment brain oxidative
stress (Song et al., 2008; Rosenzweig and Carmichael,
2013). Although a previous study has reported that sevoﬂurane post-conditioning exerts neuroprotective eﬀects by

9

reducing oxidative stress (Zhang et al., 2012), the authors
noted that this treatment may be unable to overcome the
excessive oxidative stress found in the aged brain after
ischemia. Indeed, apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor
and neuroprotective agent, protects the brain against ischemic injury in young adult but not aged animals (Kelly et al.,
2009). Thus, increased brain oxidative stress may be
another mechanism responsible for the exacerbated ischemic brain injury and the lack of neuroprotection after sevoﬂurane post-conditioning in aged rats.
Several limitations of this study should be
acknowledged. First, the cerebral blood ﬂow was not
measured during the experiment. The diﬀerence in
cerebral blood ﬂow reduction induced by the
microﬁlament insertion might result in diﬀerence in
infarct size between young adult and aged rats. In
addition, the possibility that sevoﬂurane postconditioning increased cerebral blood ﬂow in the young
but not in the aged rats could not be excluded.
However, we did not monitor cerebral blood ﬂow during
MCAO and reperfusion. Although the result of infarct
size in young adult and aged rats in our study was
consistent with previous report, the lack of laser Doppler
for cerebral blood ﬂow measurement is a major
limitation of our study. Second, it has been shown that
brain mitochondrial KATP channels mediate ischemic
brain injury and anesthetic post-conditioning-induced
neuroprotection (Adamczyk et al., 2010). Decreased brain
mitochondrial KATP channel Kir6.2 contributes to exacerbated ischemic brain injury and the failure of neuroprotection by anesthetic post-conditioning in diabetes (Li et al.,
2013a). Further studies are needed to examine whether
aging changes brain mitochondrial KATP channels and
to determine their involvement (or not) in the increased
ischemic brain injury as well as lack of neuroprotection
by anesthetic post-conditioning observed in our study.
In conclusion, the importance of understanding the
mechanisms underlying exacerbated ischemic brain
injury and determining whether a neuroprotective
strategy can improve neurological outcome in elderly
patient following ischemic stroke has been recognized in
recent years. The present study has demonstrated that
the aging-induced decrease in Bcl-2 expression may
lead to increased cell apoptosis in the brain of aged rats
after ischemic stroke, contributing to the exacerbated
ischemic brain injury observed. Although sevoﬂurane
post-conditioning reduced ischemic brain injury in young
adult rats, its neuroprotective eﬀects was not observed
in aged animals. The failure to enhance Bcl-2 levels by
sevoﬂurane post-conditioning might at least partly
explain the lack of neuroprotection of aged rats in this
experimental model.
