Background Acute ischemic stroke is common and disabling,
but there remains a paucity of acute treatment options and
available treatment (thrombolysis) is underutilized. Advanced
brain imaging, designed to identify viable hypoperfused tissue
(penumbra), could target treatment to a wider population.
Existing magnetic resonance imaging and computed
tomography-based technologies are not widely used pending
validation in ongoing clinical trials. T2* oxygen challenge magnetic resonance imaging, by providing a more direct readout of
tissue viability, has the potential to identify more patients
likely to benefit from thrombolysis – irrespective of time from
stroke onset – and patients within and beyond the 4·5 h
thrombolysis treatment window who are unlikely to benefit
and are at an increased risk of hemorrhage.
Aims This study employs serial multimodal imaging and voxelbased analysis to develop optimal data processing for T2*
oxygen challenge penumbra assessment. Tissue in the ischemic hemisphere is compartmentalized into penumbra, ischemic core, or normal using T2* oxygen challenge (single
threshold) or T2* oxygen challenge plus cerebral blood flow
(dual threshold) data. Penumbra defined by perfusion
imaging/apparent diffusion coefficient mismatch (dual threshold) is included for comparison.
Methods Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion was
induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6) prior to serial
multimodal imaging: T2* oxygen challenge, diffusionweighted and perfusion imaging (cerebral blood flow using
arterial spin labeling).
Results Across the different methods evaluated, T2* oxygen
challenge combined with perfusion imaging most closely predicted 24 h infarct volume. Penumbra volume declined from
one to four-hours post-stroke: mean ± SD, 77 ± 44 to
49 ± 37 mm3 (single T2* oxygen challenge-based threshold);

Introduction
Following an acute ischemic stroke, the ischemic penumbra represents electrically inactive and metabolically compromised but
potentially viable tissue which is the target for acute stroke therapies. It ultimately becomes incorporated into final infarct unless
salvaged by reperfusion. The thrombolytic agent alteplase
(recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, rt-PA) is the only
drug currently licensed to treat stroke. It may be administered
within 4·5 h of stroke onset based on clinical symptoms and a
noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan to exclude intracerebral hemorrhage or major established hypodensity (1).
Alteplase is designed to induce reperfusion by lysing occluding
blood clots and significantly increases independent recovery, but
carries a risk of brain hemorrhage (∼2%, increasing with delay in
administration) and is underutilized. A UK report of thrombolysis rates reported that an overall 1·4% of acute stroke patients
were thrombolysed, despite 14% of patients being eligible for
thrombolysis (2).
Thrombolysis decisions may soon be informed by more
advanced imaging, identifying a potential responder population
based on individual pathophysiology. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) perfusion imaging (PI)/diffusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) mismatch is widely accepted as a marker of penumbral tissue, while DWI/FLAIR mismatch may have utility in
predicting lesion age and is under investigation as a selection
marker for thrombolysis when stroke onset time is unknown
(3,4). Clinical adoption of perfusion/diffusion mismatch is currently limited by the lack of standardized perfusion and diffusion
thresholds, uncertain ability to differentiate penumbra from
benign oligemia, and uncertainty whether DWI hyperintensity
reflects irreversible damage, particularly at early time-points.

Clinical trials have to date failed to support the utility of
perfusion–diffusion mismatch in selection for thrombolysis (5,6).
Alternative MRI techniques for penumbra detection are therefore
worthy of investigation, particularly methods that may offer an
index of tissue viability that is not dependent on interpretation of
PI thresholds alone.
We have developed such an alternative approach for penumbra
detection. T2* oxygen challenge (T2*OC) detects compensatory
mechanisms in response to reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF),
which may identify a distinct MRI tissue signature of penumbra.
Penumbra displays a higher venous deoxyhemoglobin concentration than surrounding tissue due to increased oxygen extraction
fraction (OEF) (7) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) (8). T2*
MRI is sensitive to OEF and CBV changes as venous deoxyhemoglobin provides the contrast for blood oxygen level-dependent
(BOLD) T2* imaging (9). T2*OC uses a transient hyperoxic challenge to identify different tissue compartments in the ischemic
hemisphere, based on changes in deoxyhemoglobin : oxyhemoglobin ratio (10). Deoxyhemoglobin and free oxygen dissolved in
plasma are paramagnetic and will reduce T2* signal, while diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin has minimal influence on T2*.
Increased oxygen delivery during an OC converts deoxyhemoglobin to oxyhemoglobin, with a resultant increase in T2*-weighted
signal which can be mapped as a percentage signal change
(Fig. 1). Penumbra (and large veins) therefore displays the great-

est increase in T2*-weighted signal during an OC, ischemic core
displays the smallest change, and nonischemic tissue displays a
small increase in signal.
T2*OC may provide insight into the dynamic behavior of
hypoperfused tissue, and better prediction of tissue viability compared with the PI/DWI paradigm. A small proof of concept study
in acute stroke patients (11) supports its potential clinical utility,
and subsequent preclinical developments have improved technique sensitivity and ability to translate to the clinic (12).

Aims
Compartmentalizing penumbra using two parameters (dual
threshold analysis combining T2*OC with CBF values) rather
than using a single T2* threshold may improve the technique
further and provide a more accurate assessment of penumbra. We
sought to compare single- and dual-threshold analysis for penumbra quantification using T2*OC and to evaluate its utility for
serial scanning to track penumbra fate over the first four-hours in
a rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
model. Serial PI and DWI (zero to four-hours), and 24 h
T2-weighted imaging provided information on ischemia, acute
tissue injury, and infarct, respectively, and alternative assessments
of penumbra from PI/apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mismatch and ADC lesion growth.

Methods
All experiments were performed under a UK Home Office license,
were subject to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986)
and approved by the local University Ethical Review Panel.
Figure 1 displays the full experimental protocol.
Rodent MCAO surgery
Anesthesia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 6, 290–
350 g, Harlan, Bicester, UK) with 5% isoflurane and maintained
at 2% in medical air, enriched with oxygen (30%).
Body temperature was maintained at 37°C ± 0·5°C and a
femoral artery cannulated for continuous blood pressure monitoring (AcqKnowledge, Biopac Systems, Goleta, CA, USA) and
blood gas analysis. Permanent MCAO (pMCAO) was achieved
with a 5-0 silicon rubber-coated intraluminal monofilament
advanced to block the origin of the middle cerebral artery (13).
MRI scanning
MRI data were acquired on a Bruker Biospec (Wikingerstrasse,
Karlsruhe, Germany) 7-T/30-cm system equipped with an
inserted gradient coil (121 mm ID, 400 mT/m) and a 72-mm
birdcage resonator.
T2*-weighted imaging
A single-shot, gradient echo EPI sequence (TE: 20 ms, TR: 10 s,
matrix 96 × 96, FOV 25 × 25 mm, 8 contiguous slices of 1·5 mm
thickness, 2 averages, temporal resolution 20 s, 30 repetitions) was
used to assess T2*-weighted signal change during OC. The paradigm for the T2*-weighted OC sequence was five-minutes
breathing air, followed by five-minutes breathing 100% oxygen,
and then 10 mins breathing air. Four coronal MRI slices throughout MCA territory, selected to minimize the effect of susceptibility distortion around the ear canals, were used to generate
T2*-weighted signal change maps using ImageJ (http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). The average baseline signal (over fiveminutes) was subtracted from the peak signal during OC, then
divided by the average baseline signal and multiplied by 100.
DWI and PI scanning
DWI [spin-echo planar (SE-EPI) TE: 43 ms, TR: 4000·3 ms,
matrix 96 × 96, FOV 25 × 25 mm2, 3 directions: x, y, z, B values: 0,
1000 s/mm2, 8 slices of 1·5 mm thickness] was performed to
assess ischemically injured tissue and it was possible to collect
data from eight slices, four of which anatomically matched PI and
T2*. Noninvasive quantitative CBF was carried out to identify the
perfusion deficit on four 1·5-mm thick coronal slices throughout
the MCA territory using a form of pseudo-continuous arterial
spin labeling based on a train of adiabatic inversion pulses
(14,15). The sequence employs a spin-echo EPI imaging module
(TE 20 ms, TR 7000 ms, matrix 96 × 96, FOV 25 × 25 mm, slice
thickness 1·5 mm, 16 averages, 4 shots) preceded by 50 hyperbolic
secant inversion pulses in a 3s train.
T2-weighted imaging
A coronal RARE T2 sequence (effective TE: 46·8 ms, TR: 5000 s;
in plane resolution 97 μm; 30 slices, 0·75 mm thickness) was used
for T2-derived infarct measurement at 24 h post-stroke.

MRI data analysis for penumbra assessment
Volumes of tissue with abnormal T2*OC response were determined using two approaches: (1) applying a single threshold
[mean plus 2 standard deviations (SDs) of the contralateral hemisphere, excluding the ventricles, venous sinuses, and large veins]
to T2*OC maps in ImageJ to derive tissue volumes (8,16);
(2) voxel-based analysis using T2* and CBF data and thresholds
to categorize tissue into four compartments (T2*OC-defined
penumbra, ischemic core, normal tissue and veins/venous
sinuses, see Fig. 3a). PI and DWI data were analyzed in two ways,
(1) voxel-based analysis using ADC and CBF thresholds to categorize tissue into five compartments: PI/ADC mismatch, ischemic core, normal, negative mismatch, and ventricles; and (ii)
penumbra volume derived from ADC lesion growth using an
in-house absolute ADC threshold.
Quantitative ADC maps (in mm2/s) were calculated using Paravision (Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany) and subsequently
analyzed using ImageJ. CBF maps were also generated using
ImageJ. The ADC lesion was thresholded using an in-house absolute ADC value of 0·59 × 10−3 mm2/s, which when applied to data
at four-hours post-stroke generated an ADC lesion which
matched 24 h (brain swelling corrected) infarct following permanent MCAO in Sprague-Dawley rats.
Coregistration
T2* images were linearly coregistered to corresponding ADC slice
maps using Analyze (AnalyzeDirect, Inc., Overland Park, KS,
USA). Following coregistration, T2*, ADC and CBF thresholds
were applied to relevant images (four coronal slices within MCA
territory) for voxel-based analysis and volumetric measurements
of tissue compartments.
Voxel-based analysis
Voxel-based analysis, generated using codes written in Matlab
(MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) allowed unbiased analysis of the
spatial, volumetric, and dynamic evolution of penumbra and
ischemic core. Tissue was compartmentalized using thresholds set
for two parameters: (1) T2* signal change and CBF for T2*OC
data sets; and (2) ADC and CBF data sets for PI/ADC mismatch.
Color-coded images were derived based on T2*OC signal change
and CBF values, or ADC and CBF values enabling analysis of
temporal changes in voxel distribution across ischemic core, penumbra, and nonischemic tissue.
The number of voxels within each tissue compartment was
counted and converted to an area by multiplying the number of
pixels by the pixel area (0·0678 mm2) and then a volume by multiplying the areas by slice thickness (1·5 mm) and adding the
volumes for the four consecutive slices. Group data were generated for each tissue compartment at each acute time-point poststroke for T2*and CBF, ADC/CBF, and from the single T2*
threshold data sets.
Large veins and venous sinuses were segregated from the main
tissue compartments by excluding tissue with elevated T2*
(>mean + 2 SD of contralateral hemisphere) and CBF (values
above threshold – 57% reduction of mean contralateral CBF).
Ventricles were excluded from the ADC/CBF data sets by applying
an ADC threshold value (0·96 × 10−3 mm2/sec).

For T2*OC/CBF analysis, the four compartments were:
T2*OC-defined penumbra: T2* signal change above set threshold, CBF value below set threshold
• Ischemic core: T2* signal change below set threshold, CBF
below set threshold
• Normal: T2* signal change below and CBF above set thresholds, and
• Veins and venous sinuses: both T2* signal change and CBF
above set thresholds
For ADC/CBF analysis, the five compartments were:
• PI/ADC mismatch: ADC value above set threshold, CBF value
below set threshold
• Ischemic core: both ADC and CBF values below set thresholds
• Normal: both ADC and CBF values above set thresholds
• Negative mismatch: ADC value below threshold, CBF value
above threshold, and
• Ventricles: Above an ADC threshold of 0·96 × 10−3 mm2/s

•

ADC lesion expansion
ADC lesion expansion from one to four-hours was subtracted
from 24 h infarct data to provide an alternative assessment of
penumbra.
ADC lesion expansion
The absolute ADC threshold of 0·59 × 10−3 mm2/s was applied,
and the volume of the ADC lesion quantified by multiplying the
area on each slice by 1·5 (slice thickness) and summing the data
for either four or eight slices. Penumbral volume was derived by
subtracting the ADC lesion volume at each time-point from the

swelling-corrected 24 h infarct volume and was quantified over
four slices, for direct comparison with T2*OC and PI/ADC mismatch and for all eight slices available from DWI.
Quantifying infarct volume at 24 h
Infarct was calculated from regions of hyperintensity on the
RARE T2 scans and corrected for ipsilateral brain swelling and
contralateral compression (17). Eight coronal RARE T2 slices
which matched the four-hour acute ADC slices were selected, and
the ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere areas, as well as 24 h
infarct areas, were calculated by manual tracing using ImageJ. The
volumes of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres and the
infarct were calculated by summing the individual areas and multiplying by slice thickness (0·75 mm).
Prediction error
Ischemic core and penumbra volumes were summed and subtracted from edema-corrected infarct to calculate a prediction
error for each method.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SD. Comparison of physiological
variables, lesion evolution, and volumetric differences in ischemic core and penumbra across the four methods were
analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Student’s paired t-test and
Bonferroni correction. A paired t-test was used to analyze ADCderived lesion volume at four-hours and T2-defined infarct at
24 h.

T2*OC -defined penumbra
Single threshold analysis
During OC, an increased T2* percentage signal change, compared
with surrounding and contralateral tissue, was apparent in dorsolateral cortex (Fig. 1). This increased signal lay within the perfusion deficit adjacent to the diffusion abnormality (Figs 1 and 2).
The mean volume of tissue defined as penumbra was
77 ± 44 mm3 at one-hour post-stroke and gradually declined over
subsequent time-points (Table 2) as the volume of ADC-defined
core increased. OC repeated at 24 h revealed no increased T2*
signal in tissue previously identified as penumbra (Fig. 1,
Table 2).
Dual threshold analysis
Combining T2*% signal change and CBF data, voxels defining
penumbra were clustered in the dorsolateral cortex, with the
remaining voxels categorized as ischemic core, normal, or venous
sinuses/veins (Fig. 3a). Volumetric data for penumbra and ischemic core at three time-points are shown in Table 2. Normal and
venous compartments remained stable throughout (data not
shown).
PI/ADC mismatch-defined penumbra
Dual threshold voxel-based analysis
Equivalent ADC/CBF maps revealed a similar pattern of penumbra, ischemic core, and normal voxels (Fig. 3b). The fourth compartment (CBF above threshold, ADC below threshold) defined a
small number of negative mismatch voxels. Volumetric data for
penumbra and ischemic core are shown in Table 2. Normal and
negative mismatch compartments remained stable throughout
(data not shown).
ADC lesion growth-defined penumbra
Penumbra defined by subtracting the initial ADC lesion (over the
same four slices) from the 24-h T2-defined (edema-corrected)
infarct is presented in Table 2 for comparison. ADC data were also
available across a greater rostro-caudal range (eight coronal
slices). Penumbral volume determined from ADC lesion growth
across eight slices was 168 ± 59 mm3 at one-hour, 119 ± 50 mm3
at 2·5 h, and 92 ± 48 mm3 at four-hours post-stroke.
Comparison of methods for penumbra and ischemic
core detection
Volumetric (Table 2) and spatial differences (Fig. 3) in tissue
compartments were apparent between T2*OC/CBF and PI/ADC
mismatch-defined penumbra, although differences across the
four methods were not statistically significant. At one-hour poststroke, for penumbra volume determined from T2*OC/CBF, 69%
of voxels were also determined to be penumbra on PI/ADC mismatch, and for penumbra volume determined from PI/ADC mismatch, 44% of voxels were also determined to be penumbra on
T2*OC/CBF. The equivalent figures were 59% and 55%, respectively, at 2·5 h, and 47% and 30%, respectively, at four-hours
post-stroke.
The sum of penumbra and ischemic core volumes, for the
different methods, was compared with (edema-corrected) infarct
volume to assess their predictive value (Fig. 4). Dual threshold

Fig. 4 Prediction error for different methods of penumbra and ischemic
core analysis. Penumbra and ischemic core volumes, calculated using each
of the three methods (dual ADC/CBF, single T2*OC + ADC lesion, and
dual T2*OC/CBF), were added together and subtracted from 24 h
(edema-corrected) infarct volume to generate prediction errors
(mean ± SD, n = 5). ADC, apparent diffusion coefficient; CBF, cerebral
blood flow; OC, oxygen challenge.

T2*/CBF produced the smallest prediction error at all three timepoints. All four methods provide evidence of remaining penumbra at the four-hour time-point. Four-hour ADC lesions
compared with 24 h T2-defined infarct revealed evidence for
further lesion growth beyond four-hours (Figs 5 and 6).

Discussion
Positive identification of penumbra is not employed in the
current imaging selection for intravenous rt-PA administration,

several observational clinical studies support perfusion/diffusion
mismatch as a penumbral marker that may identify a ‘responder’
population, both within three-hours of onset and at times up to
nine-hours after onset (18,19), a differential treatment effect in
imaging-selected patients is not yet supported by randomized
controlled trial data (6,20). PI/DWI mismatch is limited by the
lack of standardized perfusion and diffusion thresholds (21,22)
and small size of clinical data sets from which thresholds are

reversibility of some DWI lesions with early reperfusion (23) and
a heterogeneous metabolic state on concurrent positron emission
tomography (PET) from voxels within acute DWI lesions (24). A
fundamental limitation of current MR penumbral imaging is the
inability to detect metabolic activity. By offering a dynamic
measure of deoxyhemoglobin concentration that reflects variations in OEF (therefore, tissue metabolic capacity) and CBV, the
T2*OC technique may better discriminate penumbra, healthy

As expected, a measureable volume of penumbra was detected
with all four analysis methods at one-hour post-stroke and
decreased in size with time, as tissue became incorporated into the
ischemic core. Because a significant volume of penumbra was
detected using all four methods at four-hour post-stroke, the OCs
per se may have supported penumbra tissue and attenuated ADClesion growth during the scanning session. In previous studies
using this rat strain and stroke model, where no OCs were
applied, less than 10 mm3 of mismatch remained by three to
four-hours post-stroke. There is evidence in the literature
supporting the potential of oxygen to prevent penumbra loss. In a
published study where PaO2 was maintained at 235–240 mmHg,
no deterioration in mismatch volume was apparent over the first
four-hours post-stroke (27). Studies investigating normobaric
hyperoxia have reported 100% O2 attenuated ADC lesion growth
without altering CBF, thereby preserving CBF/ADC mismatch,
and reducing infarct volume in permanent and transient MCAO
models (28–30).

tissue, and ischemic core compared with existing MRI mismatch
techniques.
This study provides evidence for the utility of T2*OC serial
imaging in preclinical acute stroke research, and improved
predictive value when T2*OC is combined with CBF data using
voxel-based analysis. The maintenance of the increased T2* signal
during OC and its return to baseline following OC is consistent
with T2*-weighted signal change reflecting differences either in
penumbral oxygen consumption or vasculature response to OC
compared with surrounding tissue (10,11,25,26). Earlier validation studies with single time-point T2*OC also confirmed that
the region of increased T2* signal exhibited characteristics of
penumbra, that is, hypoperfused tissue with ongoing glucose
metabolism (25) and recovery after early reperfusion (26).

Limitations and further improvements
This pilot study was not designed to establish the superiority of
one method over another, but to explore the relationship between
T2*OC responsiveness and blood flow in the evolving stroke
lesion: as such, it was not powered to detect statistical differences
between techniques. The data demonstrate a trend to improved
prediction of final infarct volume by T2*OC combined with perfusion imaging, which needs to be confirmed in a larger study.
The potential for translation of T2*OC as a clinical imaging
method has been established (11). A new clinical study is under
way to optimize the T2*OC technique on scanners of different
field strength, using healthy volunteers, a controlled human
model system of brain hypoperfusion, and a homogeneous clinical population with acute stroke. Further refinements of the technique include strategies to increase the T2* signal to OC and
reduce the % oxygen delivered (12) which will be translated to the
clinic in the future.
Finally, improvements in penumbra detection may be possible
with susceptibility-weighted imaging. These sequences measure
magnitude information, but they also exploit phase information,
thereby producing T2*-weighted sequences which are exquisitely
sensitive to the dephasing effects of paramagnetic substances such
as deoxyhemoglobin, and provide enhanced contrast over conventional gradient echo sequences.

Summary
Dual threshold T2*OC/CBF voxel-based analysis identified tissue
with characteristics of penumbra within anterior cerebral artery/
MCA collateral supply territory, which decreased in size over
time. When compared with alternative methods, T2*OC combined with CBF produced the smallest error in predicting subsequent infarct volume. The additional information it delivers,
complementary to current MRI techniques for stroke diagnosis,
supports its potential use within the routine stroke imaging protocol and adds to evidence promoting T2*OC as a valuable
adjunct to PI/DWI imaging for penumbra detection. There was

some evidence that repeat OCs delayed the evolution of strokeinduced damage, but more prolonged normobaric hyperoxia and
strategies (e.g. intravenous oxygen carriers) to improve oxygen
delivery to penumbra are required to influence final outcome.
