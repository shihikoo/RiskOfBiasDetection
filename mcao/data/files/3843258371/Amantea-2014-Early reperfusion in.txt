The pathophysiological processes implicated in ischemic
brain damage are complex and extensive, including
bioenergetic failure, acidotoxicity, excitotoxicity, oxidative
stress and, more importantly, they are strongly aﬀected
by an inﬂammatory reaction that involves both cerebral
and peripheral responses. Distinct soluble and cellular
inﬂammatory mediators play a dualistic role on the
evolution of tissue damage, initially contributing to
ischemic brain injury and then to tissue repair (Amantea
et al., 2014). Pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, such as tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and IL-18
are released by activated cells including neurons, astrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells, but also by bloodborne elements to promote neuronal and glial cell death
during ischemia (Vila et al., 2000; Allan and Rothwell,
2001; Denes et al., 2013). Moreover, by inducing the
expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells,
leukocytes and platelets, pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
orchestrate the inﬁltration of immune cells, particularly
neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages into the
ischemic territory during reperfusion which contribute to
secondary tissue damage (Yilmaz and Granger, 2008;
Enzmann et al., 2013). In turn, inﬁltrating leukocytes can
release a variety of cytotoxic agents, such as proinﬂammatory cytokines (i.e. TNF-a IL-1-b, IL-6, IL-12
and IL-18), NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) from inducible NO synthase,
and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly the
gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9. A signiﬁcant elevation
of gelatinolytic activity has also been reported in the rodent
brain early after the beginning of reperfusion (Yang et al.,
2007; Amantea et al., 2008; Barber et al., 2012). These
MMPs can cause damage to the extracellular matrix and
to the blood–brain barrier (BBB), exacerbating brain
edema, hemorrhage, and ultimately neuronal and glial cell
death (Asahi et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2007; Del Zoppo,
2010; Seo et al., 2012; Lakhan et al., 2013).
Additional detrimental eﬀects of gelatinases during
ischemia include myelin loss (Jalal et al., 2012), degradation of neurotrophic factor receptors (Navaratna et al.,
2013), chemoattractant shedding from adhesion
molecules (Ahn et al., 2012), processing and activation of

Abstract—The pathophysiological processes implicated in
ischemic brain damage are strongly aﬀected by an inﬂammatory reaction characterized by activation of immune cells
and release of soluble mediators, including cytokines and
chemokines. The pro-inﬂammatory cytokine interleukin
(IL)-1b has been implicated in ischemic brain injury, however, to date, the mechanisms involved in the maturation
of this cytokine in the ischemic brain have not been completely elucidated. We have previously suggested that
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may be implicated in
cytokine production under pathological conditions. Here,
we demonstrate that signiﬁcant elevation of IL-1b occurs
in the cortex as early as 1 h after the beginning of reperfusion in rats subjected to 2-h middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo). At this early stage, we observe increased
expression of IL-1b in pericallosal astroglial cells and in cortical neurons and this latter signal colocalizes with elevated
gelatinolytic activity. By gel zymography, we demonstrate
that the increased gelatinolytic signal at 1-h reperfusion is
mainly ascribed to MMP2. Thus, MMP2 seems to contribute
to early brain elevation of IL-b after transient ischemia and
this mechanism may promote damage since pharmacological inhibition of gelatinases by the selective MMP2/MMP9
inhibitor V provides neuroprotection in rats subjected to
transient MCAo. Ó 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

inﬂammatory mediators (Amantea et al., 2007). In fact, we
have previously demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of MMP activity by the broad spectrum inhibitor
GM6001, prevents early brain elevation of IL-1b and cerebral damage produced by transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo) in rats (Amantea et al., 2007). Indeed,
the gelatinases catalyze a reaction, alternative to the
classical caspase-1-mediated cleavage, implicated in
processing pro-IL-1b into 21-kDa active fragments, as
demonstrated both in vitro (Schönbeck et al., 1998) and
in vivo under certain pathological conditions, including
ischemia (Corasaniti et al., 2005; Amantea et al., 2007;
Russo et al., 2007; Netea et al., 2010). Other caspase-1independent mechanisms of maturation of IL-1b have also
been reported, which involve neutrophil- and macrophagederived serine proteases such as proteinase-3 (PR3), elastase, and cathepsin-G (Dinarello, 1996; Coeshott et al.,
1999; Greten et al., 2007; Joosten et al., 2009; Netea
et al., 2010; van de Veerdonk et al., 2011), although their
relevance in ischemia-reperfusion injury has not been
documented to date.
In the present study, we aim at clarifying the
involvement of MMPs in the processing of IL-1b during
reperfusion in rats subjected to transient MCAo. Thus,
we demonstrate that signiﬁcant elevation of cortical
IL-1b occurs as early as 1 h after the beginning of
reperfusion and is coincident with increased MMP-2, but
not MMP-9 activity. More interestingly, at this early
stage, co-localization of IL-1b with gelatinolytic activity
mainly occurs in neurons, suggesting a possible
neuronal source of the cytokine dependent on MMP-2
activation.

anesthesia was obtained with isoﬂurane vaporized (5%
for the induction and 2% during surgery) in air, and body
temperature was kept at 37 °C with a heating blanket
throughout surgery. Using a stereomicroscope, the external carotid artery was exposed and was cut approximately
3 mm above the common carotid artery bifurcation.
A silicone-coated (0.37-mm diameter) nylon ﬁlament
(Doccol Corporation, Redlands, CA, USA) was then gently
advanced into the internal carotid artery, 18–19 mm from
the carotid bifurcation, up to the origin of the middle cerebral artery in the Willis circle. Successful occlusion was
conﬁrmed by monitoring cortical cerebral blood ﬂow
(CBF) by laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry as previously described
(Amantea et al., 2010; Armogida et al., 2011). To allow
reperfusion, the nylon ﬁlament was withdrawn 2 h after
MCAo under isoﬂurane anesthesia. Sham rats were
exposed to the same surgical procedure without MCAo.
After wound closure and discontinuation of anesthesia,
the animals were allowed to awake and were kept in their
cages with free access to food and water.
4-(4-(Methanesulfonamido)phenoxy)phenylsulfonyl)
methylthiirane, MMP2/MMP9 inhibitor V (Cat. 444285,
Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA, USA) was dissolved in
vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and administered in
a volume of 2 ll through the external carotid artery
(i.a.), 15 min before MCAo.
Cerebral infarct damage was evaluated 22 h after
reperfusion (Greco et al., 2011) by staining eight
2-mm-thick serial coronal sections from each brain with
2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in saline,
as previously described (Greco et al., 2011).

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics statement
Animal care and experimental procedures were carried
out in accordance with the guidelines of the Italian
Ministry of Health (DM 116/1992). The protocol
(Protocol Number 120000344) was dealt with for the
ethical and animal care aspects and approved by
the Committee set by the Ministry of Health at the
National Institute of Health (Rome). All surgical
procedures were performed under deep anesthesia
and all eﬀorts were made to minimize the number of
animals used and their suﬀering. The study was
conducted applying the ARRIVE guidelines (Kilkenny
et al., 2010).
Focal cerebral ischemia and drug treatments
Adult male Wistar rats (Charles River, Calco, Como,
Italy), housed under controlled environmental conditions
(ambient temperature of 22 °C, relative humidity of 65%
and 12-h-light:12-h-dark cycle), with free access to food
and water, were randomly allocated to MCAo or sham
surgery and to vehicle or drug treatment.
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in rats weighing
280–320 g by occlusion of the origin of the middle
cerebral artery with an intraluminal ﬁlament, as
previously described (Amantea et al., 2011). Brieﬂy,

Immunoreactive IL-1b levels were analyzed in individual
brain cortical tissue homogenates by an established, rat
speciﬁc, sandwich ELISA (Amantea et al., 2007), using
an immunoaﬃnity-puriﬁed polyclonal sheep anti-rat IL-1b
coating antibody (1 lg/ml) and a biotinylated, immunoafﬁnity-puriﬁed polyclonal sheep anti-rat IL-1b detecting
antibody (1:1000 dilution) kindly provided by Dr. Stephen
Poole (National Institute of Biological Standards and Controls, NIBSC, Hertfordshire, UK). Cytokine levels were calculated by interpolation from a standard curve obtained
from recombinant rat IL-1b (0.0–1000 pg/ml) and
expressed as pg of cytokine per mg of tissue proteins.
Gel zymography
Gelatinolytic activity from MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and
MMP-9 (gelatinase B) was assessed by gelatin gel
zymography (Amantea et al., 2007) in rats subjected to
2-h MCAo followed by 1-h reperfusion. Ipsilateral (ischemic) and contralateral cortical tissue samples were
homogenized in ice-cold Tris-buﬀered saline (TBS), containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.05% Brij35, pH
7.6, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, 100 lM PMSF and
a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy).
After centrifugation at 14,000  g for 20 min (4 °C), supernatants were precipitated with gelatin-conjugated Sepharose beads (Gelatine-Sepharose 4B, Amersham
Biosciences, GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy). After elution

USA). After three rinses in PBS, sections were incubated
for 2 h with the secondary antibodies Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and Cy-5-conjugated donkey anti-goat
IgG (1:100; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West
Grove, PA, USA). Nuclei were counterstained with
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI,
Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and the sections were
examined by confocal microscopy.

of the bound proteins from the beads by shaking for 1 h in
TBS containing 10% DMSO, 10 ll of brain extracts were
diluted (1:1) in loading buﬀer (0.0625 M Tris–HCl pH 6.8,
2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10% glycerol, 0.25%
Bromophenol Blue) and subjected to electrophoresis
through a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel copolymerized
with 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoretic separation, the
gel was developed and stained as previously detailed
(Amantea et al., 2007). MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were
visualized (on the basis of molecular weight) in the gelatin-containing zymograms as clear bands against a blue
background. Densitometry of the bands was performed
using ImageJ software and values of gelatinolytic activity
were expressed as arbitrary units of optical density.

Data are expressed as the mean ± standard error of
mean (S.E.M.) of the indicated number of independent
experiments and evaluated statistically for diﬀerence by
a one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Dunnett’s or Bonferroni’s post-hoc tests,
respectively. A value of P < 0.05 was considered to be
signiﬁcant.

RESULTS
The expression of IL-1b in the cortical tissue of rats
subjected to 2-h MCAo was evaluated by ELISA. As
soon as 1 h after the beginning of reperfusion, we
observed a signiﬁcant elevation of IL-1b levels in the
ipsilateral cortex of rats subjected to transient ischemia
as compared to sham-operated animals (Fig. 1). This
was coincident with an increased gelatinolytic activity
which was mainly ascribed to MMP2. In fact,
densitometric analysis of gelatin zymogram gels
revealed that MMP2 activity was signiﬁcantly elevated in
the ipsilateral cortex as compared to contralateral,

Gelatinase activity was localized in brain sections
using the MMP ﬂuorogenic substrate, dye-quenched
(DQ)-gelatin-ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), as previously described
(Amantea et al., 2008). Brieﬂy, rats were sacriﬁced 1 h
after reperfusion and their brains were dissected out and
rapidly frozen on dry ice. Cryostat-cut (20-lm-thick) coronal sections were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C with 40 lg/ml
(in PBS) of DQ-gelatin-FITC and then ﬁxed with paraformaldehyde (2% in PBS) for 5 min. The speciﬁcity of the
assay was evaluated by adding to the incubation
buﬀer the MMP inhibitor N-[(2R)-2-(Hydroxamidocarbonylmethyl)-4-methylpenthanoyl]-L-tryptophan methylamide
(GM6001) at a concentration of 1 mM. To assess co-localization of the gelatinolytic signal with IL-1b and with the
neuronal marker neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN),
the sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a
mouse anti-NeuN monoclonal antibody (1:100 in PBS
added with 0.3% Triton X-100; Chemicon International,
Temecula, CA, USA) and/or with a goat anti-IL-1b antibody

whereas MMP9 activity did not appear to be aﬀected at
this early stage of injury, i.e. 1 h after reperfusion (Fig. 2).
In order to asses the spatial distribution of elevated
gelatinolytic activity, we performed in situ zymography
on rat brain slices and observed that 1 h after the
beginning of reperfusion, gelatinase activity is increased
in the primary somatosensory cortex, insular and
piriform cortices, in the lateral part of the primary motor
cortex and in the lateral striatum of the ipsilateral
hemisphere (Fig. 3).
Thus, gelatinase activation occurs in the main
territories supplied by the MCA, corresponding to the
ischemic core (Memezawa et al., 1992; Belayev et al.,
1997). A signiﬁcant elevation of NeuN immunopositive
neurons showing elevated gelatinolytic activity is detected
in these brain regions (Fig. 3).
The in situ zymography signal is mainly localized in the
nuclei of cortical neurons (Fig. 3B and Fig. 4E, G, H) and in
the nuclei of astrocytes localized at the internal margin of

the somatosensory cortex (Fig. 4I–P), adjacent to the
corpus callosum. Interestingly, neurons expressing
gelatinolytic activity at 1-h reperfusion do also express
IL-1b (Fig. 4), suggesting that MMPs, very likely MMP2
(Fig. 2), may participate in cytokine processing. We also
detected IL-1b expression in the astrocytes adjacent to
the corpus callosum (Fig. 4J, N), and this was coincident
with gelatinolytic activity (Fig. 4K). Nevertheless, we
detected a distinct subcellular distribution, as cytokine
signal was mainly conﬁned to the cytoplasmic
compartment, whereas gelatinolytic activity was mainly
found in the astrocytic nuclei (Fig. 4O). This may suggest
that, at variance with neurons, gelatinolytic activity in
astroglia may not be involved in cytokine processing.
We have previously demonstrated that early elevation
of IL-1b and MMPs activity is detrimental to ischemic
brain injury (Amantea et al., 2007, 2008). Nevertheless,
in our previous study we have used the broad spectrum
inhibitor of MMPs, GM6001. Given the crucial role of

increased gelatinolytic activity signal observed in pericallosal regions (I, M) of the ipsilateral hemisphere is associated to the nuclei (light blue DAPI

MMP2 in the acute detrimental phase of the disease
(Fig. 2), here we have tested the eﬀect of a selective
inhibitor of gelatinases (MMP2/9 inhibitor V) and shown
that this drug, administered 15 min before MCAo, signiﬁcantly reduces brain infarct volume produced by transient
focal ischemia in rats (Fig. 5).

DISCUSSION
IL-1 is a pivotal contributor to ischemic brain damage and is
also involved in the pathophysiology of chronic conditions
that are primary risk factors for cerebrovascular disease
and represent crucial determinants of stroke clinical
outcome, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity
(Denes et al., 2011; Dinarello, 2011). Both protein and
mRNA brain levels of IL-1b have been shown to increase
as soon as few hours after transient MCAo in rats (Buttini
et al., 1994; Clausen et al., 2005) and we have previously
shown that the distribution pattern and cellular source of

the cytokine are strongly aﬀected by the intensity and
duration of the insult (Amantea et al., 2010). Although
previous ﬁndings have clearly demonstrated that late
elevation of IL-1b originates from macrophages/microglia
(Lambertsen et al., 2012), we have observed that the cytokine is expressed in neurons and astrocytes early after
MCAo in rats (Amantea et al., 2010). In the present study,
we conﬁrm this latter ﬁnding and demonstrate a signiﬁcant
increase of cortical IL-1b as early as 1 h after the beginning
of reperfusion, being the cytokine mainly expressed in cortical neurons and, to a lesser extent, in pericallosal astroglial cells.
Acute elevation of IL-1b, and consequent activation of
the IL-1 receptor 1, is harmful to the injured cerebral
tissue during ischemic stroke (Allan et al., 2005;
Amantea et al., 2007; Greenhalgh et al., 2010; Pradillo
et al., 2012). In fact, IL-1b released from neurons and glial
cells exerts autocrine and paracrine eﬀects by binding to
speciﬁc receptors on neurons, astrocytes, microglia and

endothelial cells, thus triggering a complex series of signaling events in the target cell that result in the activation
of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathways (Dinarello,
2009; Fann et al., 2013). This leads to secondary transcription of multiple inﬂammation-associated genes,
including: pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-a, IL-1b,
IL-6 andIL-18); chemokines (e.g. CXC-chemokine ligand
8, CXCL8 and CX3C-chemokine ligand 1, CX3CL1, fractalkine); and adhesion molecules (e.g. E-selectin and
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)), all contributing to ischemic reperfusion injury (Allan and Rothwell,
2001; Allan et al., 2005; Denes et al., 2011). Thus,
although recent ﬁndings have suggested the involvement
of blood-borne IL-1 in the development of ischemic cerebral damage, most evidence suggest that the brainderived cytokine plays a more crucial role in triggering
injury (Relton and Rothwell, 1992; Yamasaki et al.,
1995; Greenhalgh et al., 2010; Galea et al., 2011;
Luheshi et al., 2011; Lambertsen et al., 2012; Denes
et al., 2013).
An important issue that is still unresolved refers to the
process implicated in IL-1b production in the ischemic
brain. Recent studies suggest that plasma membrane
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs, e.g. toll-like
receptors 2 and 4, receptor for advanced glycation end
products, IL-1 receptor) on neurons and glial cells play
an important role in activating NF-kB and MAPK
signaling pathways. This is in response to endogenous
damage-associated
molecular
patterns
(DAMPs)
released by necrotic cells in the ischemic core, leading
to increased production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines,
and neuronal and glial cell death mediated by large
intracellular multi-protein complexes (approximately
700 kDa) termed inﬂammasomes (Fann et al., 2013). In
particular, signaling through NLRP1 and NLRP3 inﬂammasomes promotes activation of caspase-1 and downstream cleavage of both pro-IL-1b and pro-IL-18 into

their biologically active mature pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (Martinon et al., 2002; Dinarello, 2011; Savage
et al., 2012).
Despite the importance of inﬂammasome activation in
certain experimental models of inﬂammation, intriguing
results argue for inﬂammasome-independent and even
caspase-1-independent activation of IL-1b in certain
pathological conditions, including stroke (Corasaniti
et al., 2005; Amantea et al., 2007; Russo et al., 2007;
Netea et al., 2010). Indeed, neutrophil- and macrophage-derived serine proteases such as PR3, elastase,
and cathepsin-G have been identiﬁed as alternative
enzymes implicated in processing pro-IL-1b into 21-kDa
active fragments (Dinarello, 1996; Coeshott et al., 1999;
Greten et al., 2007; Joosten et al., 2009; Netea et al.,
2010; van de Veerdonk et al., 2011). Moreover, the
gelatinases, MMP2 and MMP9, have been suggested to
process pro-IL-1b into bioactive IL-1b in vitro
(Schönbeck et al., 1998) and in vivo (Amantea et al.,
2007; Berta et al., 2012). We have previously observed
that early brain elevation of IL-1b after transient MCAo
in rats is associated with increased gelatinolytic activity
and cytokine production is prevented by GM6001, a broad
spectrum inhibitor of MMPs (Amantea et al., 2007). Here,
we extend these ﬁndings by showing that IL-1b is
increased as early as 1 h after the beginning of reperfusion in the ischemic cortex and cytokine expression colocalizes with gelatinolytic activity in neurons of the primary
somatosensory cortex. This gelatinolytic activity appears
to be mainly ascribed to MMP2 (Fig. 2), thus, this latter
enzyme may contribute to IL-1b production early after
the beginning of reperfusion, although this latter hypothesis needs further investigation to be validated.
The expression of IL-1b in neurons and, more
speciﬁcally in their nuclei, has been previously reported
(Bandtlow et al., 1990; Lechan et al., 1990; Watt and
Hobbs, 2000; Corasaniti et al., 2001). We have originally
observed that gelatinolytic activity increases in neuronal
nuclei early after transient MCAo in rats (Amantea et al.,
2008) and this ﬁnding has also been conﬁrmed in vitro
(Hill et al., 2012). Nowadays, the presence of intranuclear
gelatinolytic activity is widely recognized (Mannello and
Medda, 2012) and here we suggest that this activity, mainly
ascribed to MMP2, is associated to early elevation of IL-1b
levels. Additional mechanisms due to intranuclear MMPs
activity may include interference with DNA repair
processes, by cleavage of the nuclear proteins, polyADPribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and X-ray crosscomplementary factor 1 (XRCC1) (Copin et al., 2005;
Yang et al., 2010). The elevation of MMP2 in cortical neurons early after the beginning of reperfusion seems to be
due to the increased expression of membrane-type
(MT1)-MMP and furin (Chang et al., 2003; Yang et al.,
2007), activators of MMP2 (Strongin et al., 1995; Sato
et al., 1996). By contrast, previous ﬁndings have demonstrated that early after temporary ischemia, there is a transient enhancement of MMP-2 in the astrocytic processes
surrounding blood vessels, which appears to contribute to
the eﬀects of reperfusion and to the early opening of the
BBB (Rosenberg et al., 1998; Planas et al., 2001; Lu
et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2007, 2013).

D. Amantea et al. / Neuroscience 277 (2014) 755–763

At later stages following transient MCAo, a
redistribution of gelatinases occurs in the neurovascular
unit, characterized by a massive increase of MMP-2
expression in microglia/macrophages (Planas et al.,
2001; Rosenberg et al., 2001) and MMP-9 in astrocytes
and neurons (Zhao et al., 2006). The former eﬀect has
been suggested to facilitate migration of macrophages
into the ischemic lesion, whereas the latter might contribute to the resolution phase. In fact, inhibition of MMP-9
between 7 and 14 days after stroke causes a substantial
reduction in the number of neurons and new vessels
implicated in neurovascular remodeling (Zhao et al.,
2006). These ﬁndings underscore the complexity of
MMP activity during ischemic tissue injury, ranging from
detrimental eﬀects during the early phases to beneﬁcial
roles at later stages, including remodeling and recovery
(see Yong, 2005). Thus, a rational modulation of the
MMPs response after stroke should be aimed at their
selective inhibition during the acute stage of injury, without interfering with beneﬁcial endogenous mechanisms
implicated in neurovascular remodeling (Rosell and Lo,
2008; Murata et al., 2012).
Over the past decade, signiﬁcant advances in MMP
research have provided a better understanding of the
biochemistry of these zinc-dependent enzymes in terms
of their structure, activation, regulation and substrate
speciﬁcity (Whittaker et al., 1999; Skiles et al., 2004;
Kontogiorgis et al., 2005; Ikejiri et al., 2005; Tu et al.,
2008). A disappointment to researchers in this ﬁeld has
been the lack of success of such compounds in the clinic
in spite of their encouraging preclinical eﬃcacy (Romanic
et al., 1998; Asahi et al., 2000; Gasche et al., 2001;
Horstmann et al., 2003; Gu et al., 2005; Amantea et al.,
2007; Nagel et al., 2008; Barber et al., 2012). A major issue
that needs to be addressed in order to improve translational
approaches with MMPs inhibitors consists in their substrate selectivity (Rosell and Lo, 2008; Kaczmarek,
2013). Indeed, most compounds tested so far have been
broad-spectrum inhibitors of MMPs, designed around chelation of the active zinc ion and their spectrum of inhibition
also includes other metalloenzymes (Tu et al., 2008).
We have previously shown that the broad spectrum
inhibitor of MMPs, GM6001, reduces brain damage and
early brain elevation of IL-1b caused by transient MCAo
in rats (Amantea et al., 2007). Nevertheless, the use of
GM6001 is limited by the fact that it also enhances membrane-type MT1-MMP-dependent activation of pro-MMP2
(Sato et al., 1996). Given the crucial contribution of MMP2 to the early detrimental eﬀects of ischemic injury, here
we aimed at testing the eﬀects of MMP2/MMP9 inhibitor
V, a mechanism-based MMPs inhibitor devoid of any
eﬀect on pro-MMP2 activation by MT1-MMP (Ikejiri
et al., 2005). Active gelatinases bind to MMP2/MMP9
inhibitor V and catalyze the opening of the thiirane ring
in the molecule, thus generating a species within the
active site that aﬀords tight binding between the inhibitor
and the enzyme (Ikejiri et al., 2005). This mechanismbased inhibition allows to selectively abrogate the deleterious activity of gelatinases and here we demonstrate that
systemic administration of this compound reduces brain
infarct volume in rats subjected to transient MCAo.

761

The prototype of this type of novel mechanism-based
inhibitors for gelatinases, (4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)
methylthiirane (referred to as SB-3CT), has been shown
to exert neuroprotection in animal models of stroke (Gu
et al., 2005; Cui et al., 2012). Nevertheless, SB-3CT is rapidly metabolized (Lee et al., 2007), leading to low systemic
concentrations in mice (Celenza et al., 2008) and has poor
water solubility (Testero et al., 2011).
By contrast, MMP2/MMP9 inhibitor V is a cellpermeable, sulfonamido analog of SB-3CT, with
increased aqueous solubility and improved selectivity for
MMP-2, MMP-9 and MT1-MMP (Ikejiri et al., 2005; Lee
et al., 2012). MT1-MMP activates MMP-2 by proteolytic
activity at the cell surface; hence, its upstream inhibition
will translate in further inhibition of MMP-2 activity
(Bonﬁl et al., 2007). So, the advantage of using MMP2/
MMP9 inhibitor V resides in its ability to shut down the
MT1-MMP/MMP-2 axis. Indeed, we have observed significant reduction of brain infarct volume in rat treated with
MMP2/MMP9 inhibitor V and this further underscores
the detrimental role of early activation of gelatinases
and poses the basis for further investigations on the
eﬀects of this drug in stroke injury.
