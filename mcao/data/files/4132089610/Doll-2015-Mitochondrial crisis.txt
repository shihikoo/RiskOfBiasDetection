Background and Purpose—The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a selectively permeable cerebrovascular endothelial barrier
that maintains homeostasis between the periphery and the central nervous system. BBB disruption is a consequence of
ischemic stroke and BBB permeability can be altered by infection/inflammation, but the complex cellular and molecular
changes that result in this BBB alteration need to be elucidated to determine mechanisms.
Methods—Infection mimic (lipopolysaccharide) challenge on infarct volume, BBB permeability, infiltrated neutrophils,
and functional outcomes after murine transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in vivo; mitochondrial evaluation of
cerebrovascular endothelial cells challenged by lipopolysaccharide in vitro; pharmacological inhibition of mitochondria
on BBB permeability in vitro and in vivo; the effects of mitochondrial inhibitor on BBB permeability, infarct volume, and
functional outcomes after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion.
Results—We report here that lipopolysaccharide worsens ischemic stroke outcome and increases BBB permeability after
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Furthermore, we elucidate a novel mechanism that compromised
mitochondrial function accounts for increased BBB permeability as evidenced by: lipopolysaccharide-induced reductions
in oxidative phosphorylation and subunit expression of respiratory chain complexes in cerebrovascular endothelial cells,
a compromised BBB permeability induced by pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial function in cerebrovascular
endothelial cells in vitro and in an in vivo animal model, and worsened stroke outcomes in transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion mice after inhibition of mitochondrial function.
Conclusions—We concluded that mitochondria are key players in BBB permeability. These novel findings suggest a potential
new therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke by endothelial cell mitochondrial regulation.   (Stroke. 2015;46:1681-1689.

he blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a highly specialized vascular interface that maintains homeostasis in brain by
separating the blood compartment from the central nervous
system. Disruption of cerebrovascular endothelial cells not only
allows entry of unwanted solutes into brain but also disrupts
the normal central nervous system entry route of critical nutrients.1,2 Disruption or dysfunction of the BBB has been observed
in cerebrovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders,
such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease,
Huntington's disease, and epilepsy.3
Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the leading cause of disability worldwide.4 It is estimated that 30%
to 40% of all strokes occur during or recently after an acute
infection.5 Acute infections initiate rapid inflammation, and
poststroke infections worsen outcomes in patients6 and in

animal models.7 However, the mechanisms of this exacerbation by infection on acute stroke outcome are not completely
understood.
Ischemia and reperfusion events result in complex cellular and molecular changes that further need to be elucidated.
To date, studies have provided evidence that the release of
oxidants, proteolytic enzymes, and inflammatory cytokines
alter BBB permeability. The BBB excludes the majority
of bacteria; however, similar to ischemia and reperfusion,
inflammation induced by bacteria alters BBB permeability.
Lipopolysaccharide has been shown to disrupt the BBB in
vivo and in vitro; however, how lipopolysaccharide exerts its
effects on the BBB is under debate.8 Previous studies found
that a lipopolysaccharide challenge results in a larger infarct
volume,7 impairs survival and disrupts BBB9 in experimental

stroke models, through mechanisms that are proposed to
involve cytokines.
In the present study, we provide the first evidence that the
exacerbation of stroke outcome by a bacterial infection mimic
is because of a novel mechanism of compromised cerebrovascular endothelial mitochondrial function. Potential deleterious mitochondrial responses to ischemia have been observed,
such as rapid changes in ATP, the release of cytochrome c, and
the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition.10,11
It is apparent that mitochondria play a pivotal role during
ischemia; however, the contributions of mitochondrial dysfunction in non-neuronal cells and the interactions between
these cells and neurons are poorly understood. In addition, the
involvement of mitochondria in ischemic damage has not been
fully elucidated. We show that pharmacological disruption of
endothelial mitochondrial function recapitulates all aspects of
the lipopolysaccharide exacerbation of stroke, including disruption of the BBB, and worsening of stroke outcome. This
discovery could provide a previously unknown mitochondrialdependent mechanism for acute stroke damage that may offer
new therapeutic directions for the treatment of acute stroke.

Methods
Mice
All procedures were conducted according to the criteria approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the West
Virginia University (WVU). C57/BL6J male mice (3–4 months old,
25-30 g; Jackson Laboratories) were used for all studies.

Anesthesia
All surgical anesthesia was induced with 4% to 5% isoflurane until
the animal showed no response to a toe pinch and was maintained
with 1% to 2% isoflurane via face-mask in O2-enriched air.

Randomization and Blinding of the Animal
Experiments
To assign pretreatments of mice, we numbered the animals and applied a simple randomization by using excel-generated random numbers. To avoid biases, we also assured that different pretreatments
were performed on the same day. The experimenters were blinded to
the pretreatments and data analysis.

Drug Administration
In a subgroup of mice, lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 055:B5,
100 μg/kg; Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) dissolved in saline (B. Braun
Medical Inc, Irvine, CA) was injected intraperitoneally 30 minutes
before transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) or sham
surgery. In another subgroup of mice, rotenone (1 mg/kg; Sigma) was
administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes before tMCAO. In the epidural application (EA) model, rotenone (2 mg/mL, 2 μL) was topically applied to the epidural membrane. An equal volume of saline
was administered to control mice.

Ischemic Model and Sham Surgery
We performed focal cerebral ischemia for 30 or 60 minutes by occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery with a 6.0 monofilament suture (Doccol, Sharon, MA). We used laser Doppler flowmetry (Moor
Instruments, United Kingdom) to detect regional cerebral blood flow
and confirm a successful occlusion (>70% decrease in flow). Rectal
body temperature was maintained at 37±0.5°C during surgery. Mice
were euthanized at several time points as indicated in the text.

Neurological Deficits
Neurological deficit was determined daily before and after tMCAO
according to a 0- to 5-point scale neurological score system as
published.12

EA Model
We induced anesthesia with 4% isofluorane and maintained with 1%
isofluorane. We placed the animal in a prone position under a stereo
dissecting microscope and made an incision down the midline of the
head and retracted the skin then removed the fascia from the skull.
Using a sharp blade, we thinned an area of the skull ≈0.3 to 0.5 mm in
diameter, divided the thinned area into several segments, performed
a craniotomy by gently removing the thinned skull segments, applied
drug or vehicle, and closed the incision.

Exclusion Criteria for Animal Experiments
The exclusion criteria for tMCAO were as follows: (1) regional cerebral blood flow decreases <70% during occlusion as detected by laser
Doppler flowmetry; (2) surgery time lasts >30 minutes; (3) no neurological deficits 3 hours after MCAO (neurological score 0); (4) no
infarction in the MCA territory on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining; (5) subarachnoid hemorrhage on postmortem
examination; and (6) substantial ambient temperature change in the
animal facility. Animals that died before the planned time of assessments were postmortem examined for subarachnoid hemorrhage, and
the mortality was recorded.
The exclusion criteria for EA model were as follows: (1) damaged
epidural membrane, (2) bleeding from the epidural membrane, (3)
the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from the epidural membrane, (4)
body temperature >39.5°C within 3 hours post surgery; and (5) death.
In this study, 7 mice were excluded: 2 mice (1 vehicle and 1 lipopolysaccharide pretreatment) because of subarachnoid hemorrhage, 4
mice (2 vehicle and 2 lipopolysaccharide pretreatment) because the
animal facility air conditioner broke down on the day that the experiments were performed, 1 mouse (pretreated with rotenone) because
laser Doppler flow did not reach 70% reduction during the occlusion.
The animal numbers included in the results are 18 vehicle and 23 lipopolysaccharide for 30 minutes tMCAO mice (4 lipopolysaccharide
pretreated mice died), 12 vehicle and 12 rotenone for 60 minutes tMCAO mice, 5 vehicle and 5 rotenone for EA mice. No animals were
excluded in EA model.

Analysis of Brain Infarct Volume
Mice were euthanized with isofluorane. We removed the brains and
cut 2-mm coronal sections with a mouse brain matrix. We stained
the sections with 2% TTC (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO) in phosphate
buffer solution (PBS) at 37°C for 30 minutes then fixed the tissue in
10% formalin phosphate buffer for digital photograph. We analyzed
the digitized image of each brain section using a computerized image
analysis software (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health) in a doubleblinded manner. To minimize the effect of brain edema, the volume
was expressed as a percentage of contralateral cortex, striatum, and
total hemisphere.

BBB Permeability Assay In Vivo
The permeability of the BBB was determined by measuring the penetration of Evans blue (Sigma) in the brain tissue. Evans blue (2% in
saline; 4 mL/kg body weight) was administered intravenously via the
tail vein 1 hour before measurement. The anesthetized animals were
perfused transcardially with saline before sampling. Each sample was
weighed and homogenized with 400 μL PBS, then precipitated by
50% trichloroacetic acid overnight. The samples were centrifuged for
30 minutes at 10 000 rpm to pellet brain tissue. Absorption of the
supernatant was measured at a wavelength of 610 nm with a plate
reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The extravasation of Evans blue was
quantified as microgram/gram brain tissue with an Evans blue standardized curve.

Isolation of Immune Cells in the Blood, Spleen,
and Brain

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

Blood was collected via cardiac puncture, then brain and spleen were
sampled after transcardial perfusion with saline. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and splenocytes were prepared using red cell lysis
buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). For brain immune cells, the
forebrain was dissected from the cerebellum and suspended in RPMI1640 medium (Corning, Pittsburgh, PA). The suspension was digested with type IV collagenase (1 mg/mL; MP Biomedicals, Solon,
OH) and DNase I (50 μg/mL; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN)
at 37°C for 45 minutes, then immune cells were isolated by 37% to
70% Percoll (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) density gradient centrifugation and collected from the interface. Single-cell suspension
was washed with staining buffer (PBS containing 0.1% NaN3 and 2%
FCS) and stained with CD45 (30-F11; eBioscience), CD11b (M1/70;
eBioscience), and Gr1 (IA8; BD Bioscience). Propidium iodide (2
μg/mL; Sigma) was used to exclude dead cells. Appropriate isotype
control antibodies were applied to set quadrants for calculating the
percentage of positive cells. Data were acquired on fluorescenceactivated cell sorter Calibur (BD) and analyzed with FlowJo software
(TreeStar, Ashland, OR).

Cell Culture
The bEnd.3 cell line (CRL-2299 from ATCC, Manassas, VA) was
originally derived from mouse brain cortex endothelial cells and
confirmed by the observed major phenotypic features of the BBB.13
Passages 25 to 30 were used in the study. The bEnd.3 cells were
routinely grown in high glucose Dulbecco modified Eagle medium
(DMEM, ATCC) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) at 37°C in 5% CO2 humid
atmosphere. Mouse primary brain microvascular endothelial cells
(B129-7023; Cell Biologics, Chicago, IL) were routinely grown in
complete endothelial cell medium (M1168; Cell Biologics) at 37°C
in 5% CO2 humid atmosphere.

BBB Permeability Assay In Vitro
Permeability assays were performed in triplicate as follows: 1.5×105
endothelial cells were grown on transwell inserts (pore size, 0.4 mm;
diameter, 6.5 mm; Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) for 2 days, 250
μg/mL fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled dextran FD-70
(70 kDa; Sigma) was added to the apical side of the filters, and the
medium in the basolateral compartment was sampled every 15 minutes for 2 hours. The FD-70 permeability through the cultured endothelial monolayer was determined directly by analysis of the apparent
permeability coefficient (Papp).14 The concentration of FD-70 was determined with an FD-70 standard curve on plate reader (Ex. 490 nm,
Em. 515 nm). Papp (cm/s) was calculated.

Oxygen Consumption
Oxygen consumption rate was measured at 37°C using an XF96e extracellular analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the bEnd.3 cells
or primary endothelial cells were seeded into Seahorse Bioscience
XF96e cell culture plates (16 000 cells/well) in 80-μL medium and allowed to adhere and grow overnight in the 37°C humidified incubator
with 5% CO2. Then the cells were supplied with 80-μL medium with
or without lipopolysaccharide (concentration varies as indicated in
the text) and cultured for additional 24 hours. For the measurements
of extracellular flux, the medium was changed 1 hour before the start
of the extracellular flux assay to unbuffered (pH 7.4) DMEM containing 2 mmol/L GlutaMax, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and 25 mmol/L
glucose and incubated at 37°C without CO2. Oligomycin, carbonyl
cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), rotenone
and antimycin A (all from Sigma), and 10× dilutions were prepared
for the assays. A sensor cartridge was loaded with 20 μL of oligomycin (10 μmol/L) into port A, 20 μL of FCCP (30 μmol/L) into
port B, 20 μL of rotenone (20 μmol/L) and antimycin A (20 μmol/L)
into port C. The Sensor cartridge was calibrated and equilibrated and

then the protocol was implemented on an XF96e Analyzer. This protocol allowed determination of the basal level of oxygen consumption, the amount of oxygen consumption linked to ATP production,
the maximal respiration capacity, and the nonmitochondrial oxygen
consumption.

Detect Respiratory Chain Complex I–IV by Flow
Cytometry
We cultured cells in 6-well plates and treated cells with lipopolysaccharide (1 μg/mL) for 48 hours, then we washed cells and performed intracellular staining with an intracellular staining set (cat.
72–5775; eBioscience). We stained cells with anti–rabbit-NADHdehydrogenase-ubiquinone-1-alpha-subcomplex-assembly-factor-1
(NDUFAF1; sc-292085, 1:100; Santa Crutz), anti–mouse-NADH-dehydrogenase-ubiquinone-1-subunit-C2 (NDUFC2; sc-393771, 1:100;
Santa Crutz), anti–mouse-NADH-dehydrogenase-ubiquinone-ironsulfur-protein-2 (NDUFS2; sc-390596, 1:100; Santa Crutz), anti–rabbit-succinate-dehydrogenase (SDH; cat.11998, 1:100; Cell Signaling,
Beverly, MA), anti–rabbit-cytochrome c (Cyc; cat.4280, 1:100; Cell
Signaling), anti–mouse-cytochrome c oxidase (COX IV; cat. 4850,
1:100, Cell Signaling) antibodies for 30 minutes and labeled the cells
with a proper second antibody, PE-anti-rabbit (Cat.8885, 1:100; Cell
Signaling) or PE-anti-mouse (Cat.8887, 1:500; Cell Signaling). We
acquired data on BD Calibur flow cytometry and analyzed mean fluorescence intensity by Flowjo software.

Immunohistochemistry Staining
To perform the immunohistochemistry costaining of mitochondria
and MyD88, the bEnd.3 cells were cultured on cover slips, stained
with mitotracker (Life technologies, Grand Island, NY) for 30 minutes, washed with PBS then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA;
Polysciences, Inc) for 10 minutes at 37°C. The cells were blocked with
5% goat serum staining buffer and stained with anti–rabbit-MyD88
(1:200; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) overnight, then washed with PBS,
and stained with goat-anti-rabbit-FITC (Life Technologies) for 2
hours. The cells were further washed with PBS and mounted on glass
slides using prolong gold antifade reagent (Life Technologies). The
slides were photographed with confocal LSM 510 microscope Zeiss
(Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using software ZEN 2012.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 5 software (Graphpad
software, La Jolla, CA). Differences between groups were analyzed
by the unpaired Student t test, 1-way ANOVA or 2-way ANOVA as
indicated in the figure legends.

Results
Lipopolysaccharide Increases Cerebral Infarction
and BBB Permeability in Stroke
To test the effects of a bacterial infection mimic on stroke
outcome, we performed intraperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharide (100 μg/kg) or saline 30 minutes before a
30-minute tMCAO in mice (Figure 1A). Lipopolysaccharide
challenge significantly increased infarct volume in the cortex
(P=0.04), striatum (P=0.009), and total hemisphere (P=0.04)
after 30-minute tMCAO followed by 48-hour reperfusion
(Figure 1B and 1C).
However, the time course of poststroke BBB leakage,
whether biphasic or progressive, remains subject to debate.15,16
Using Evans Blue as a tracer, our recent work demonstrated
biphasic peaks of BBB openings at 6 hours and 72 hours but
not at 24 hours or 48 hours reperfusion after 1-hour tMCAO.17
The 6-hour-peak of BBB opening may suggest the early

inflammatory infiltration and brain edema in acute stroke.
Thus, to determine whether the acute infection challenge
regulates cerebrovascular response to stroke, we compared
the effects of lipopolysaccharide versus saline on Evans blue
extravasation at 6-hour reperfusion after tMCAO (Figure 2A).
Six hours after tMCAO (30-minute occlusion), mice were
perfused and isolated brains were divided into ipsilateral and
contralateral hemispheres, and each hemisphere was analyzed
separately for Evans blue extravasation. Lipopolysaccharide
significantly increased Evans blue extravasation in the ipsilateral hemisphere after tMCAO compared with control mice
(Figure 2B), indicating that lipopolysaccharide enhances cerebrovascular permeability after stroke.

Lipopolysaccharide Increases Neutrophil
Infiltration Into the Injured Brain in Stroke
Stroke and acute infections elicit inflammatory responses
in the injured brain that are mediated by multiple factors.

Neutrophils are among the first peripheral cells to infiltrate
ischemic brain tissue within 30 minutes to a few hours after
focal cerebral ischemia, and neutrophil infiltration is thought
to contribute to acute phase damage in stroke.18 To assess brain
leukocyte invasion, we measured neutrophils in brain and
peripheral tissues by flow cytometry. Neutrophil accumulation in the ipsilateral and contralateral brain hemispheres was
significantly greater in the lipopolysaccharide group than in
saline control (n=5; P<0.05) at 6-hour tMCAO post reperfusion (Figure 2C). Concurrently, fewer neutrophils and greater
lymphocytes were detected in the peripheral blood and spleen,
but monocytes did not differ between vehicle- and lipopolysaccharide-treated mice (Figure IA and IC in the online-only
Data Supplement). The neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio was significantly decreased in the blood (n=5; P=0.02) and the spleen
(n=5; P=0.004) of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice (Figure IB
and ID in the online-only Data Supplement). tMCAO mice
with lipopolysaccharide exhibited worsened neurological

increased BBB permeability after tMCAO.

Lipopolysaccharide Impairs Mitochondrial
Oxidative Phosphorylation in Cerebrovascular
Endothelial Cells

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

To determine whether the lipopolysaccharide effects in stroke
are caused by direct effects on cerebrovascular endothelial
cells, we used a cultured cerebrovascular endothelial cell
(cCVEC) model. Immunohistochemical staining showed that
CD31 (an endothelial cell marker) and TLR4 (a lipopolysaccharide receptor) colocalize in the brain vasculature (Figure
IIA in the online-only Data Supplement), closely resembling
the expression of CD31 and TLR4 on cCVECs (Figure IIB
in the online-only Data Supplement). This indicates that
cCVECs have critical components for an in vitro model to
investigate lipopolysaccharide effects on cerebrovascular
endothelial cells.
The brain has a high energy demand and elevated mitochondrial content resulting in it being vulnerable to reductions in oxidative phosphorylation. Given the expression
of TLR4 on the brain vascular endothelial cells, we determined whether lipopolysaccharide would directly affect
oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial capacity in
CVECs. Using Mitotracker Red for visualization of mitochondria, we detected MyD88, an adaptor protein involved
in TLR4 signaling,19 broadly distributed but also colocalized with mitochondria in cCVECs (Figure 3A), suggesting that lipopolysaccharide-induced signaling pathways are
linked to mitochondria. To directly evaluate the mitochondrial function in cCVECs affected by lipopolysaccharide, a
bioenergetic assay was used to examine cellular energetic
oxygen consumption rates. Basal oxygen consumption rate
did not significantly differ in cCVECs challenged by lipopolysaccharide for 24 hours, but maximal respiration and
spare capacity were significantly reduced in cCVECs cultured with 0.1 to 100 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (Figure 3B;
Figure IIIA in the online-only Data Supplement). Similarly,
in primary cerebrovascular endothelial cells, an lipopolysaccharide challenge for 24 hours resulted in a decrease
in maximal respiration and spare capacity at 100 μg/mL
(Figure 3C; Figure IIIB in the online-only Data Supplement).
However, reduced oxidative phosphorylation was not associated with cell death or cell viability in cCVECs or primary
CVECs, as evidenced by propidium iodide staining (Figure
IVA and IVB in the online-only Data Supplement), calcein
AM staining (Figure IVC and IVD in the online-only Data
Supplement) for 24 hours in the exception of high dose of
lipopolysaccharide (100 μg/mL). In view of the lipopolysaccharide effects on mitochondrial respiration, respiratory chain complex I proteins (NADH dehydrogenase
ubiquinone subunits: NDUFAF1, NDUFS2, and NDUFA2),
complex II protein (SDH), complex III protein (Cyc), and
complex IV protein (COX IV) were examined after a 1-μg/

mL lipopolysaccharide challenge for 48 hours, and flow
cytometry confirmed that lipopolysaccharide decreases the
expression of complex I (NDUFS2 and NDUFA2), complex
III (Cyc), and complex IV (COX IV; Figure 3D) proteins.
Together, these results strongly suggest that oxidative phosphorylation of CVECs is compromised with lipopolysaccharide exposure, and this effect does not induce endothelial
cell death. As such, we asked whether mitochondrial activity
affects endothelial cell function.

Impaired Mitochondria Disrupt CVEC Tight
Junction and Increase BBB Permeability
It is known that lipopolysaccharide impairs the BBB permeability both in vitro and in vivo at doses that are thought to be
caused by inflammatory mediators such as cytokines,8 but little is known about the role of mitochondria in BBB integrity.
Using a pharmacological strategy to manipulate mitochondrial respiration, we first demonstrated that inhibition of respiratory chain complex I with rotenone (Figure 4A), uncoupling
of electron flow from ATP production with FCCP (Figure 4B),
or inhibition of complex V with oligomycin (Figure 4C) rapidly increased FITC-dextran 70 permeability in a cCVEC
monolayer transwell system in vitro. Immunocytochemical
analysis revealed that the normally well-defined, linear cell–
cell junctions were disrupted when oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited by mitochondrial inhibitors (Figure 4D).
Both increased permeability and cell–cell junction disruption
caused by the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation occurred
in the absence of cell death as evidenced by propidium iodide
staining (Figure VA in the online-only Data Supplement)
and calcein AM staining (Figure VB in the online-only Data
Supplement). These data suggest for the first time that mitochondria play a key role in maintaining BBB integrity in vitro.
To determine whether inhibition of mitochondria affects the
BBB permeability in vivo, we developed an epidural application model for central nervous system drug administration in
mice (Figure 5A–5D). This model permits local drug delivery without traumatic brain injury (Figure 5C), thus allowing
assessment of BBB permeability. Rotenone (2 μL, 2 mg/mL
dissolved in saline) was applied to the epidural surface, and
BBB permeability was evaluated by Evans blue quantification after 6 hours. Mice treated with rotenone showed significantly higher Evans blue extravasation than vehicle controls
(Figure 5D). These data support the hypothesis that mitochondria are critical for the regulation of cerebrovascular permeability in vivo.

Inhibition of Mitochondrial Function Worsens
Stroke Severity in Mice
If inhibition of mitochondrial function increases BBB permeability, the same perturbation would be expected to affect
infarct size and stroke severity. When we treated mice with
rotenone before tMCAO (Figure 6A), increased BBB permeability (Figure 6B), increased infarct volumes (Figure 6C), and
worsened neurological deficits (Figure 6D) were observed.
Thus, the lipopolysaccharide-induced exacerbation of stroke
outcome most likely is because of the deleterious effect of
mitochondrial inhibition.

Discussion
Acute systemic infection is a risk factor or trigger for human
stroke5,6 and is associated with worsened clinical outcome.20
Although much is known about the factors that worsen stroke
severity in clinical subjects and experimental stroke models, less
is understood about their mechanisms. Our data are the first to
demonstrate that a bacterial infection mimic acts with ischemic
challenge to markedly exacerbate stroke damage via a mitochondrial-dependent mechanism. This new finding could also provide
an explanation for the association of infections with severity of
brain damage and BBB dysfunction from stroke: the induction of
hypometabolism in cerebrovascular endothelial cell mitochondria.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized
as an accomplice in vascular diseases and ischemic stroke.

More recently, it has been shown that components of the
TLR4 signaling pathways, MyD88 and TRAF6, are linked
with mitochondria and affect oxidative phosphorylation.21
The expression of MyD88 in mitochondria of endothelial
cells (Figure 3A) supports that mitochondrial function can
be affected by lipopolysaccharide (Figure 3B and 3C). It
is notable that no significant effect of lipopolysaccharide
is seen on cCVEC basal oxygen consumption and ATPlinked oxygen consumption on treatment with oligomycin
(Figure 3B; Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement),
indicating that lipopolysaccharide does not significantly
change basal oxygen demand in mitochondria after 24 hours
of treatment with lipopolysaccharide. However, the loss of
maximal respiration and spare capacity (Figure 3B; Figure

III in the online-only Data Supplement) demonstrates that
mitochondrial capacity is reduced by lipopolysaccharide and
thus the effects exacerbate the mitochondrial impairment
by ischemia. Cellular respiration, mitochondrial biogenesis,
and mitochondrial function require coordinated expression
of proteins encoded by nuclear and mitochondrial genes
including mitochondrial complex I–IV. The reduced expression of respiratory chain complex I, III, and IV proteins in
cCVECs by lipopolysaccharide provides further evidence

that lipopolysaccharide compromises the endothelial mitochondria function (Figure 3D).
The 30-minute tMCAO model mimics a mild ischemic event that results in a small infarct (Figure 1C) and
does not cause visible BBB disruption at 6-hour reperfusion (Figure 2B). The bacterial infection mimic challenges
before tMCAO increased BBB permeability (Figure 2B) and
exacerbates infarct volume (Figure 1C). There are inconsistent data for lipopolysaccharide- or cytokine-induced BBB

dysfunction8 that may be because of complex mechanisms.
McColl et al7 demonstrated an interleukin-1–dependent
mechanism of stroke exacerbation using the same lipopolysaccharide-tMCAO model. Others have demonstrated that
lipopolysaccharide alters transporters or enzymes involved
in BBB maintenance.22 Our observation that pharmacological inhibition of mitochondria disrupts BBB integrity and
increases BBB permeability in vitro (Figure 4) and in vivo
(Figure 5) strengthens the argument that BBB permeability
is increased by lipopolysaccharide after stroke (Figure 2)
through a direct mitochondrial mechanism resulting in a
larger infarct volume and worsening neurological deficit.
Increased BBB permeability is positively correlated with
massive vasogenic and cytotoxic edema post stroke23,24 and
elevated neutrophils in the ischemic area, which contribute to
infarct expansion25 and poor clinical outcome.26 Our observation of neutropenia and low neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio may
be a consequence of BBB damage that causes rapid migration of neutrophils into damaged tissue. Brain infiltration of
neutrophils could also account for secondary lesion growth
and increased infarct size in the ischemic brain as seen with
lipopolysaccharide treatment (Figure 1C). These data may
provide translational evidence that neutropenia and low
neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio may predict severe stroke.
We observed that lipopolysaccharide-induced inhibition
of mitochondria exacerbates infarct volume and opens BBB
in tMCAO mice (Figures 1 and 2), but that mitochondria
inhibition in cCVECs and primary CVECs does not affect
cell viability in 24 hours (Figure IV in the online-only Data
Supplement). This suggests that the functional impairment

of endothelial mitochondria by lipopolysaccharide may be
reversible, and an effective intervention could be designed
to prevent/restore BBB during strokes. However, our
data also indicated that a high dose of lipopolysaccharide
(100 μg/mL) induced cell death and reduced cell viability in
cCVECs (Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement), and
extension of lipopolysaccharide exposure for 48 hours induced
cell death in both cCVECs and primary CVECs (Figure IVA–
IVD in the online-only Data Supplement). Therefore, the
effective mitochondrial directed intervention may be limited
by the severity or the length of the infectious exposure to rescue BBB damage.
Leukocytosis and cytokine and chemokine storm are features of the acute-phase reaction in systemic infections and
in acute stroke. It is becoming increasingly apparent that
inflammation can disturb cell energy metabolism. Our recent
study found that neuronal mitochondrial function was rapidly
and profoundly decreased by tumor necrosis factor-α resulting in neuronal cell death.27 Another study demonstrated that
tumor necrosis factor-α elevated oxygen consumption rate
in endothelial cells.28 The present study did not address the
complex lipopolysaccharide-induced effects on mitochondria;
however, our novel findings refreshed the traditional idea of
infection-inflammation responses and provided a new explanation for the lipopolysaccharide effects on BBB dysfunction,
a direct mitochondrial-dependent mechanism.
The application of rotenone on the epidural surface argues
that its effect on BBB opening is by compromised mitochondria in vascular endothelial cells (Figure 5). Rotenone exposure is associated with clinical features of parkinsonism in

Doll et al   Mitochondria and Blood–Brain Barrier    1689
humans29 and broadly used to induce Parkinson’s disease–
like symptoms in animal models30 as well. This suggests
that the mitochondrial-dependent BBB opening may be
involved not only in the progress of stroke but also in other
neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and
Alzheimer’s disease.
In summary, the present study describes a previously
unknown mechanism of infection-induced direct mitochondrial dysfunction in cerebrovascular endothelial cells, which
compromises BBB permeability and exacerbates acute stroke
outcomes. Moreover, our observations argue that maintenance of mitochondrial function is critical to the integrity of
the BBB. The data also suggest a translational significance:
maintenance of brain endothelial cell mitochondrial function
can improve the acute outcome of stroke and perhaps other
neurodegenerative diseases.

Supplemental Figures I-V and Figure Legends

Supplemental Materials and Methods:
Cell viability assay
We performed the cell viability assay simultaneously with the oxygen consumption assay. We
seeded cells in 96 black well plates and treated with LPS. We added PI (2 µg/ml) to evaluate cell
death on plate reader (Ex. 535 nm and Em. 617 nm), washed with PBS, added Calcein AM (Life
technology) and stained for 30 minutes to measure cell viability (Ex. 490 nm and Em. 520 nm).
Immunohistochemistry staining
To obtain brain samples for immunohistochemistry assays, animals were anesthetized with
isofluorane and perfused with PBS followed by 10% formalin PBS. Brains were removed, postfixed overnight in 10% formalin PBS at 4°C, cryoprotected in graded sucrose solutions, and
embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT (VWR Scientific). Coronal sections (20 μm) were cut through,
blocked with 5% goat serum staining buffer and stained with rabbit anti-mouse TLR4 (1:100,
Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts) and rat anti-mouse CD31 (1:200, Abcam) overnight, and then
washed with PBS and stained with goat-anti-rabbit-FITC and goat-anti-rat-PE antibodies (Life
technologies, Grand Island, New York) for 2 hours. The sections were further washed with PBS
and mounted on glass slides using prolong gold anti-fade reagent (Life technologies).
To perform the immunohistochemistry staining on bEnd.3 cells, the cells were cultured on cover
slips and fixed with 4% cold paraformaldehyde (PFA, Polysciences, Inc.) followed by blocking,
staining, washing and mounting, as outlined above. The slides or sections were photographed with
confocal LSM 510 microscope Zeiss (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using software ZEN 2012.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 5 software (Graphpad software, La Jolla, California).
Differences between groups were analyzed by the unpaired Student’s t-test or one way ANOVA
as indicated in the figure legends.
