and regenerative processes and subacute
protection by site-targeted inhibition of the
alternative pathway of complement

Abstract
Background: Complement promotes neuroinflammation and injury in models of stroke. However, complement is
also being increasingly implicated in repair and regeneration after central nervous system (CNS) injury, and some
complement deficiencies have been shown to provide acute, but not subacute, protection after murine stroke.
Here, we investigate the dual role of complement in injury and repair after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.
Methods: We used complement-deficient mice and different complement inhibitors in a model of transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion to investigate complement-dependent cellular and molecular changes that occur through
the subacute phase after stroke.
Results: C3 deficiency and site-targeted complement inhibition with either CR2-Crry (inhibits all pathways) or CR2fH (inhibits alternative pathway) significantly reduced infarct size, reduced apoptotic cell death, and improved
neurological deficit score in the acute phase after stroke. However, only in CR2-fH-treated mice was there sustained
protection with no evolution of injury in the subacute phase. Whereas both inhibitors significantly reduced
microglia/macrophage activation and astrogliosis in the subacute phase, only CR2-fH improved neurological deficit
and locomotor function, maintained neurogenesis markers, enhanced neuronal migration, and increased VEGF
expression. These findings in CR2-fH-treated mice correlated with improved performance in spatial learning and
passive avoidance tasks. The complement anaphylatoxins have been implicated in repair and regenerative
mechanisms after CNS injury, and in this context CR2-fH significantly reduced, but did not eliminate the generation
of C5a within the brain, unlike CR2-Crry that completely blocked C5a generation. Gene expression profiling revealed
that CR2-fH treatment downregulated genes associated with apoptosis, TGFβ signaling, and neutrophil activation,
and decreased neutrophil infiltration was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. CR2-fH upregulated genes for
neural growth factor and mediators of neurogenesis and neuronal migration. Live animal imaging demonstrated
that following intravenous injection, CR2-fH targeted specifically to the post-ischemic brain, with a tissue half-life of
48.5 h. Finally, unlike C3 deficiency, targeted complement inhibition did not increase susceptibility to lethal poststroke infection, an important consideration for stroke patients.

Conclusions: Ischemic brain tissue-targeted and selective inhibition of alternative complement pathway provide
self-limiting inhibition of complement activation and reduces acute injury while maintaining complementdependent recovery mechanisms into the subacute phase after stroke.
Keywords: Ischemic stroke, Complement inhibition, Neuroinflammation, Neuroprotection

Background
Following onset of cerebral ischemia, many stroke patients show reperfusion of their infarct either spontaneously or as a secondary effect of thrombolytic therapy.
Cerebral reperfusion initiates a cascade of pathophysiological events that cause secondary injury, which can
lead to greater tissue damage and more severe functional
and cognitive deficits. Clinical observations and experimental studies indicate a central role for complement
in the propagation of ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI)
in both the central nervous system (CNS) and in nonCNS tissue [1, 2].
Cumulative evidence indicates that following cerebral
ischemia and reperfusion, complement is activated via
the lectin pathway and amplified via the alternative pathway (reviewed in [3]). Deficiency or pharmacologic inhibition of either pathway is protective in the acute
phase following murine ischemic stroke [4–8]. However,
from a clinical standpoint, it is important to determine
the effect of any potential therapeutic strategy on
longer-term outcome after stroke. While complement
activation may be injurious in the acute phase, there is
evidence that complement also has neuroprotective
functions in the CNS, including after stroke [9, 10]. In
this regard, it has been shown that the protective effect
of lectin pathway deficiency is not sustained in the subacute phase of stroke [11], even though there is a wide
therapeutic window for lectin pathway inhibition and
acute protection [5]. In addition, deficiency in C3, a central protein of all complement pathways, provides effective protection in the acute phase [12, 13], but not the
subacute phase following ischemic stroke [14].
In a previous study, we demonstrated that alternative
pathway-deficient (fB−/−) and inhibited (CR2-fH treated)mice are protected from acute injury after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. We further demonstrated that
alternative pathway inhibition resulted in reduced infarct volumes and reduced neurological deficit scores in
the subacute phase (7 days) after ischemia [4]. In the
current study, we follow up on this preliminary observation and investigate how complement modulates the
cellular and molecular events that contribute to poststroke degenerative and regenerative processes, and
how this relates to cognitive impairment and functional
recovery. We also investigate whether subacute protection is a specific property of the alternative pathway.

For this study, we utilize CR2-fH, an inhibitor shown to
specifically inhibit the alternative pathway [15], and
CR2-Crry, an inhibitor of all complement pathways that
has been shown to provide acute protection after
stroke, but that has not been investigated with regard
to subacute outcome [13, 16]. The complement inhibitors Crry and fH are targeted to sites of complement
activation (C3d deposition) via the complement receptor 2 (CR2) moiety [16].

Methods
CR2 fusion proteins

The complement inhibitors CR2-Crry and CR2-fH were
constructed, expressed, and purified as previously described [15, 16]. For quality control, complement inhibitory
activity was tested by Zymosan assay as described [17].
Transient ischemic stroke model

Two cohorts of male 8- to 10-week-old wt C57BL/6
mice or C3−/− mice on C57BL/6 background (Jackson
Laboratories) were independently subjected to transient
ischemic stroke, with 60-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) [13]. In the first cohort, wt mice received one treatment of 0.25 mg CR2-Crry, 0.4 mg
CR2-fH, or 100 μl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) vehicle given intravenously 30 min following reperfusion.
Dosing was based on efficacy titrations performed in a
model of intestinal IRI [15, 16]. Following either 24 h
or 7 days of reperfusion, animals were sacrificed and
brains processed for histology or protein extraction. For
antibiotic prophylaxis, C3−/− mice received 250 mg/L
ciprofloxacin (VetSource) in drinking water ad libitum
14 days prior to MCAO and until sacrifice. In the second cohort, wt mice received either one treatment of
0.4 mg CR2-fH or 100 μl PBS vehicle 30 min following
reperfusion. Following either 3 or 7 days of reperfusion,
mice were assessed for neurological outcome as well as
performance on Barnes maze and passive avoidance
tests. Mice were sacrificed on day 7 and brains processed for histology or protein extraction. Cerebral
blood flow was assessed by Laser Doppler Flowmetry
(Moor Instruments) before, during, and following ischemia; mice were excluded if not achieving a reduction in blood flow to 20 % of pre-ischemia levels.
Temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate were also
monitored before, during, and following ischemia, and

Alawieh et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:247

consistent with previous reports, no differences were
observed [13]. All groups were randomly assigned, and
experimenters were blinded to identity of groups. All experiments and procedures were conducted in accordance
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals by the National Institutes of Health and approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at
the Medical University of South Carolina.
Neurological outcomes

Neurological deficit was assessed following MCAO by a
blinded observer using a five-point scoring system, as
previously described [18]. Additionally, locomotor activity was automatically quantified using the Versamax
open field activity monitor (AccuScan Instruments).
Mice were placed in a random corner and allowed to acclimate for 10 min prior to a 60-min testing period. External noise, lights, and other stimuli were minimized to
reduce bias. Several measures were automatically retrieved during the task including total distance moved,
number of movements, time spent at periphery, and
time spent at the center. Activity readings taken prior to
sham procedure were used to establish any differences
in baseline activities. The duration that the animal spent
at the periphery vs. the center was used to assess anxiety
level during the task.
Behavioral testing

Animals of the second cohort were tested for their performance on both Barnes maze and passive avoidance
tasks. To assess spatial reference memory, mice were
trained on Barnes maze for 5 days before surgery, as
previously described [19], then tested again on days 3
and 7 after reperfusion for the time needed to escape
into the hole, the number of error pokes, and the length
of the animal’s path prior to escape. An automated passive avoidance apparatus (Coulbourn Instruments) was
used to assess avoidance learning with automated sensing and shock systems (GraphicState® 4, Coulbourn
Instruments). The apparatus included a double compartment chamber with one lit and one dark compartment.
Mice were allowed to explore the chamber for 5 min on
habituation phase. Following habituation, the mice were
given one trial where a shock is associated with the dark
side, allowed 48 h of rest, and then tested for retention
measured as latency to enter the dark side. Testing was
repeated on days 3 and 7 post-reperfusion with no shock
delivered during test phase.
Histological and immunohistochemical analysis

For analysis of infarct volume, brains were
transcardially with PBS before their removal,
into 2-mm coronal sections and stained with 2
nyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) [20]. Infarct

perfused
then cut
% triphevolumes

were analyzed with ImageJ software (National Institutes
of Health) and calculated as percentage of total brain
from summation of four sections obtained 2 mm apart.
Immunohistochemical staining was conducted on 8-μm
paraffin sections and assessed by a blinded observer by
light microscopy (Olympus BX61). Following antigen retrieval (IHC World), the following primary antibodies
were used: anti-ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1, 1:250; Abcam), anti-mouse glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1000; Dako), anti-von Willibrand
Factor (vWF, 1:500; Dako), anti-Ki67 (1:500; Abcam),
anti-doublecortin (Dcx, 1:200; Millipore), and anti-Gr-1
(1:100, Stem Cell). Primary antibodies were detected
with ImmPress-HRP kit and NovaRed peroxidase chromagen (Vector Laboratories), and primary antibodies were
omitted for negative controls. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was
performed using ApopTag Peroxidase Staining Kit (Millipore) per manufacturer’s instructions. For birth dating
proliferating neuroblasts, intraperitoneal BrdU was administered to a subset of mice every other day starting
24 h after reperfusion, and BrdU-positive cells were detected by anti-BrdU antibody (1:300; Sigma).
Quantification of staining

Paraffin sections were obtained +2 to −2 mm relative to
bregma, and sections 200 μm apart were used for quantification. The ischemic core and the penumbra (area
surrounding the ischemic core) were confirmed with
Luxol fast blue staining or counterstaining, and random
fields were examined within the penumbra using an automated motorized stage on an Olympus BX61 using
Visiopharm software. Counting of apoptotic cells was
performed on an average of eight sections per brain,
with the entire ipsilateral hemisphere being quantified,
and density was calculated as number of positive cells
per square millimeter of tissue. Reactive astrocytes,
microglia/macrophages, and vWF positive vessels were
quantified on sections 200 μm apart. An average of five
sections/brain was quantified. Cells were counted in randomly generated fields, and density was calculated as
number of positive cells per square millimeter of tissue.
Dcx- and Ki67-positive cells were quantified within the
subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles, the
subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus, the basal
ganglia, and the hippocampus from ×40 magnification
random fields on sections 25 to 50 μm apart (three sections/brain). All analyses were done by light microscopy
(Olympus BX61 with Visiopharm image acquisition software) by an observer blinded to the experimental groups.
Tissue protein analysis

Following sacrifice, brains were divided into ipsilateral
and contralateral hemispheres, and protein was

Alawieh et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:247

extracted by homogenization in NP-40 lysis buffer
(Invitrogen) containing 1 mm PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich),
92.6 μm FUT175 (BD Biosciences) and 5 μL of protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay kit
(Thermo Scientific). Vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; Abcam), complement C5a (BD Biosciences),
and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) were assessed through
Western blotting of 25 μg total protein, with SDSPAGE run under reducing conditions, and detected
with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector
Laboratories). Signal densities were calculated relative
to β-actin and normalized to wt groups.

Statistics

Statistical differences between parametric data (infarct
volumes, activity values, ELISA values, cell counts,
densitometry, and Nanostring data) were assessed using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with Bonferroni’s multi-group comparison, and non-parametric data
(neurological deficits) were compared with the KruskalWallis test with Dunn’s comparison (Prism 5.0, GraphPad). Survival was compared from all mice subjected to
MCAO using the Kaplan-Meier test. Differences between data were considered statistically significant when
p < 0.05.

Results
Nanostring analysis

Eight C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks of age) were also subjected
to 1 h MCAO and treated with either CR2-fH or PBS
vehicle (n = 4/group) to assess the effect of CR2-fH on
gene expression profile after MCAO. Animals were perfused with PBS 72 h after reperfusion, and their brains
were extracted for RNA Extraction. Gene expression
analysis was performed using the Nanostring nCounter
Analysis System (Nanostring Technologies) using a
custom-designed codeset containing 249 genes involved
in immunological and cell survival processes (Additional
file 1) [21]. Each reaction contained 250 ng of total RNA
in a 5-μL aliquot, plus reporter and capture probes, and
six pairs of positive control and eight pairs of negative
control probes. Analysis and normalization of the raw
Nanostring data was conducted using nSolver Analysis
Software v1.1 (Nanostring Technologies). Raw counts
were normalized to levels of reference gene. A background count level was estimated using the average
count of the eight negative control probes in every reaction plus two SDs.

Animal imaging

Five C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks of age) had their heads
shaved and treated with Nair 2 days prior to MCAO surgery described above. Fluorescently labeled CR2-fH was
injected according to the therapeutic protocol described
above. CR2-fH was labeled using Xenolight C750 NIR
Fluorescent Dye according to manufacturers instructions
(Perkin Elmer). Mice were anesthetized and imaged at 6,
24, 48, 72 and 96 h and at 7 days post-injection using a
Maestro EX imaging system (Perkin Elmer). Shamoperated animals were also injected as controls. Fluorescent signal was quantified with supplied software, and
tissue half-life was calculated according to the formula
t1/2 = t × ln(2)/ln(N0/Nt), where t = fluorescence signal
after time gone by, N0 = signal at beginning (6 h), Nt =
signal after period of time (90 h).

Targeted complement inhibition reduces the extent of
injury post-MCAO

It has been shown previously that C3 deficiency [12, 13]
or treatment of wt mice with CR2-Crry [16] or CR2-fH
[15] significantly reduces infarct volume 24 h after
MCAO and reperfusion. Here, we investigated the effect
of targeted complement inhibition on subacute injury by
assessing infarct volumes 7 days after MCAO, and compared subacute with acute (24 h) outcomes. Pharmacological inhibition in all studies reported here was
achieved with a single dose of inhibitor (CR2-Crry or
CR2-fH) administered 90 min after ischemia and 30 min
after reperfusion. Compared to wt control mice, infarct
volume was significantly decreased in C3-deficient mice
and in wt mice treated with either CR2-Crry or CR2-fH
at both 24 h and 7 days post-MCAO (Fig. 1a). At 24 h
after MCAO, there was no significant difference in infarct volume between C3-deficient mice and CR2-fH- or
CR2-Crry-treated mice. However, unlike CR2-fH-treated
mice (and wt controls), C3-deficient and CR2-Crrytreated mice had a rebound increase in infarct volumes
at 7 days compared to 24 h post-MCAO. CR2-fHtreated mice did not show any significant difference in
infarct volume between the two time points postreperfusion. We also assessed cell death in the ipsilateral
cortex, basal ganglia, and hippocampus 7 days following
MCAO using TUNEL staining. CR2-Crry- and CR2-fHtreated mice showed a significant reduction in cell death
in the basal ganglia and cortex compared to C3−/− and
PBS-treated mice, but only CR2-fH-treated mice had a
significant reduction in hippocampal cell death compared to all other groups. Further, compared to CR2Crry-treated mice, CR2-fH-treated mice had significantly
less cell death in the cortex and hippocampus. There
were no significant differences between C3−/− mice and
control mice across the three brain regions (Fig. 1b).
Thus, there is an evolution of secondary injury subacutely after MCAO in C3-deficient mice and CR2Crry-treated mice, but not in CR2-fH-treated mice.

Targeted complement inhibition reduces subacute
microglia/macrophage activation and astrogliosis after
MCAO

Microglia and astrocytes become activated in response
to pathological changes, and microglia/macrophage activation and astrogliosis mark inflammation within the
CNS, which is reduced at 24 h after MCAO by complement inhibition [4]. Microglia/macrophage activation
and astrogliosis in the subacute phase at 7 days postMCAO was assessed by immunohistochemical detection
of Iba-1 and GFAP markers in the striatum, respectively.
Compared to wt controls, there was a significant reduction in both activated microglia/macrophages and reactive astrocytes in CR2-Crry- and CR2-fH-treated mice
(Fig. 2). In contrast, there was no significant difference
in the detection of either marker in C3-deficient mice
compared to wt. No differences were observed in the
contralateral hemispheres between groups. These data
indicate that C3 inhibition, but not C3 deficiency, reduce
glial cell activation in the subacute phase after MCAO.

Effect of complement inhibition on neurological outcome
and locomotor function after MCAO

We next determined whether the reduced injury and inflammation seen in complement-inhibited mice translated into improvement in neurological outcome after
MCAO. Both CR2-Crry and CR2-fH have been shown to
improve neurological deficits 24 h after MCAO [4, 13],
and here, we used the same deficit scoring method to assess neurological outcome over a 1-week period postMCAO. Compared to wt controls, C3 deficiency and
treatment with either CR2-Crry or CR2-fH significantly
improved neurological deficit scores up to 72 h postMCAO (Fig. 3a). However, only CR2-fH-treated mice
continued to display significantly improved neurological deficit scores at 7 days post-MCAO.

To more objectively assess neurological deficit, we
measured locomotor activity using an open field activity
monitor. There was no significant difference in locomotor activity between any group up to 3 days postMCAO, but on day 7, CR2-fH-treated mice had significantly increased locomotor activity compared to all
other groups (Fig. 3b, c). Since a difference in anxiety
levels may confound performance on open field as well
as other tasks, we also assessed anxiety levels across the
groups by measuring the percentage of time spent at the
center of an open field. We found no significant differences in anxiety levels among the different groups on
days 3 and 7 post-MCAO (Fig. 3d). The picture emerging from the data thus far indicates that in the subacute
phase after stroke, CR2-fH provides better protection
than CR2-Crry or C3−/− in terms of evolution of secondary injury and neurological outcome.
CR2-fH maintains neurogenesis and enhances neuronal
migration in the subacute phase after MCAO

Since complement activation products have been implicated in ischemia-induced neurogenesis that contributes
to recovery, we investigated the effect of complement inhibition on proliferation and neurogenesis in the brain
after MCAO. Immunostaining for the proliferation
marker Ki-67 was performed on sections from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the
subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus, neurogenic niches of the adult brain previously studied in the
context of ischemia-induced neurogenesis [22–24]. C3deficient and CR2-Crry-treated mice, but not CR2-fHtreated mice, had a significant reduction in numbers of
proliferating cells within the ipsilateral SVZ compared
to wt controls, indicating that, unlike total complement
blockade, alternative pathway blockade does not inhibit
ischemia-induced neurogenesis (Fig. 4a). No differences
were observed between any group in the ipsilateral

SGZ (Fig. 4b), or in contralateral regions (data not
shown). Immunostaining for doublecortin (Dcx), another marker of neurogenesis that is expressed by immature neurons (neuroblasts), similarly showed a higher
number of Dcx-positive cells in the ipsilateral SVZ of
CR2-fH-treated mice compared to CR2-Crry-treated mice
or C3-deficient mice (Fig. 4c, d). No differences in numbers of Dcx-positive cells were observed between any
group in the contralateral SVZ (data not shown). Since
CR2-fH treatment did not significantly increase neurogenesis compared to wt mice at 7 days post-MCAO, we further investigated a potential effect of CR2-fH on neuronal
migration by quantifying the number of Dcx-positive cells
in the ipsilateral basal ganglia and hippocampus of mice
post-MCAO; CR2-fH treatment significantly increased
neuroblastic cell migration from the SVG to the basal ganglia (Fig. 5a, b) and hippocampus at 7 days after injury
(Fig. 5c, d).

CR2-fH less effectively blocks complement activation than
CR2-Crry

Complement activation products, specifically C3a and/or
C5a, have been implicated in promoting neuroregeneration after CNS injury. Therefore, since CR2-Crry inhibits
all complement pathways and CR2-fH inhibits only the
alternative pathway, a quantitative difference in the level
of complement activation is one potential mechanism
that could account for the different subacute outcomes
and difference in SVZ neurogenesis. To assess this, we
measured C5a levels in the ipsilateral hemisphere of
mice on days 1, 3, and 7 after MCAO (Fig. 6). Compared
to controls, CR2-fH significantly inhibited C5a generation when measured at 1 and 3 days after MCAO, but
to a lesser extent than CR2-Crry, which almost completely blocked C5a generation. No differences in C5a
levels were detected across the groups on day 7. This result is consistent with CR2-fH providing sufficient

in the acute phase, while allowing for lectin and/or classical pathway generation of complement activation products at a level sufficient for promoting recovery and
neurogenesis in the subacute phase.

previously reported to exhibit increased expression in
migrating neuroblasts [25, 26], were among the significantly upregulated genes.

Profiling of gene expression changes after CR2-fH
treatment.

Since VEGF plays an important role in angiogenesis as
well as neuroblast proliferation and migration following
ischemia [25], we assessed VEGF levels in the ipsilateral
hemisphere 7 days after MCAO. CR2-fH-treated mice
had significantly increased levels of VEGF 7 days after
MCAO compared to both wt controls and CR2-Crrytreated mice (Fig. 8a, b). Immunostaining for von Willibrand factor (vWF), however, did not reveal any differences in vessel density between the groups at 7 days
post-MCAO (Fig. 8c). While it is possible that alternative pathway inhibition with CR2-fH may promote postischemia neurogenesis by increasing VEGF levels, it does
not appear to have any effect on angiogenesis in the subacute phase. These data support the above Nanostring
data and further implicate VEGF in the observed CR2fH-dependent increase in neuroblast proliferation and
migration.

Due to the improved subacute outcomes observed with
CR2-fH treatment compared to CR2-Crry treatment of
C3 deficiency, we further investigated the effect of CR2fH treatment by analysis of gene expression profiles
3 days after MCAO. We used Nanostring analysis for
high-sensitive capture of mRNA transcripts among a
panel of 248 genes involved in immunological, inflammatory, and cell death processes (see Additional file 1
for full list). Among the identified hits of genes exhibiting a significant difference between CR2-fH-treated and
wt groups (Additional file 1), genes whose expression
showed more than 25 % increase or decrease are shown
in Fig. 7a, b. Apoptotic markers (Bax, Atf4), components
of TGFβ signaling (TGFβ 2, BMP2, Smad3), and markers
of neutrophil activation (Gr-1, MMP9) were among the
downregulated genes, which is line with our findings of
reduced inflammatory cell activation and apoptosis in
mice treated with CR2-fH. On the other hand, neuronal

the times that were recorded pre-surgery (Fig. 9a). However, on day 7 post-MCAO, there was a significant deterioration in performance of the wt control group, whereas
the performance of CR2-fH-treated mice was not significantly different to that recorded pre-surgery.
On Barnes Maze task 3 days post-MCAO, the performance of wt control mice deteriorated significantly,

length, and number of error pokes compared to presurgical baseline. By day 7 post-MCAO, performance of
this group was improved, but was still significantly
worse compared to pre-surgical baseline (p < 0.05). In
contrast, CR2-fH-treated mice displayed no impairment
on Barnes maze performance at either 3 or 7 days postMCAO compared to pre-surgical baseline (Fig. 9b–d).
Thus, compared to wt controls, CR2-fH treatment

significantly improved spatial reference memory
through the subacute phase after ischemic stroke.
To control for possible cognitive-enhancing effects of
CR2-fH, we also treated sham-operated mice with CR2fH and tested cognitive performance after sham surgery
on both tasks. CR2-fH treatment did not enhance cognitive performance in sham-operated mice (Fig. 9). The
above data together show that a single post-reperfusion
dose of CR2-fH not only improves neurological/locomotor

CR2-fH treatment reduces neutrophil infiltration into the
brain after MCAO

Data from Nanostring analysis showed a downregulation
in markers of neutrophil activation after MCAO and
CR2-fH treatment, and we therefore examined neuronal
infiltration by staining sections with the neutrophil
marker Gr-1. Compared to wt, CR2-fH treatment resulted in a significant (threefold) reduction in the number of Gr-1-positive cells, suggesting a significant
reduction in neutrophil infiltration into the parenchyma
(Fig. 10a, b). These data supplement the data above
showing a significant reduction in the activation of resident inflammatory cells in the brain after CR2-fH
treatment.
Acutely administered CR2-fH targets to the post-ischemic
brain and persists into the subacute phase after stroke

We have previously demonstrated C3d-specific binding
of CR2-fH [15], and to investigate C3d deposition and
the targeting and retention of CR2-fH in the postischemic brain, we performed in vivo fluorescence imaging. Fluorescently labeled CR2-fH was administered
according to our therapeutic protocol, and shaved heads
of mice (hair removed to prevent signal interference)
were imaged over a 7-day period post-reperfusion. Targeting and localization of CR2-fH was clearly evident
6 h after reperfusion, with a gradual decline to near undetectable levels in live animals by 7 days (Fig. 11a, b).
The calculated tissue half-life based on fluorescence signal was 48.5 h. No fluorescence was detected in the
brains of sham-operated animals at any time point (not
shown). Although fluorescent signal was barely detectable in live animals 7 days after MCAO, ex vivo imaging

Page 11 of 15

of the brain removed after sacrifice on day 7 demonstrated the continued presence of labeled CR2-fH, with
localization to the ipsilateral parenchyma (Fig. 11c).
Complement inhibition does not increase post-stroke
mortality

Immunosuppression and associated complications such
as pneumonia are a major concern in stroke patients,
and are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality both
clinically [27, 28] and in the experimental model used
here [29]. As complement plays an important role in
host defense, we determined whether treatment with
CR2-Crry or CR2-fH affects animal survival in our
model. Neither inhibitor significantly affected 7-day survival compared to control-treated animals (Fig. 12). On
the other hand, C3-deficient mice had significantly reduced 7-day survival compared to mice receiving inhibitor treatment. To investigate whether increased
mortality in C3-deficient mice may be due to compromised host defense, we treated C3-deficient mice with
antibiotics for 2 weeks prior to MCAO and for 7 days
post-reperfusion. Antibiotic treatment reversed the effect of C3 deficiency on animal survival, with survival
rates the same as for CR2-fH-treated mice. These data
indicate that CR2-fH treatment does not compromise
complement-dependent host defense mechanisms and
increase susceptibility to secondary infectious complications following experimental ischemic stroke.

Discussion
Complement-mediated inflammation has been shown to
play an important role in the progressive degenerative
events that take place after ischemic stroke, but there is
increasing evidence that complement is also involved in
subsequent repair and regenerative mechanisms that
occur during recovery [3]. Numerous studies have shown

that complement deficiency or inhibition is protective in
the acute phase after stroke (24–48 h), but it has also been
shown that complement deficiency can worsen subacute
outcomes [11, 14]. The reasons for the differences in acute
and subacute outcomes are not well understood, but it is
clear that complement has a balancing role in injury vs.
protection in many pathological conditions, and differences in acute and subacute outcomes after stroke may be
due to balancing roles for complement in early inflammation and injury vs. subsequent neuroprotection and neurogenesis. In the context of neuroprotective functions of
complement, both C3a and C5a have been shown to be
protective against excitotoxic neuronal injury [30–32],
and C3a has a protective role in neonatal hypoxiaischemia brain injury [33], even though C1q exacerbates

injury in a similar model [34]. C3a is also implicated in
promoting neurogenesis, both basal [14] and following ischemic stroke [34], and similar to C5a, it has been shown
to regulate the differentiation and migration of neural progenitor cells in vitro [35, 36]. In addition, complement opsonins of the classical (C1q), lectin (MBL, ficolins), and
alternative (properdin) pathways, as well as C3 opsonins
common to all pathways, promote the clearance of apoptotic cells and debris, which is important for the resolution
of inflammation and recovery [35, 37, 38].
The data presented here support the notion of a dual
role for complement in ischemic stroke by comparing
C3 deficiency with transient approaches of complement
inhibition using CR2-Crry and CR2-fH (Fig. 13). We
demonstrate that whereas C3 deficiency and complement inhibition provides acute protection after ischemic
stroke, only complement inhibition reduces inflammation and cell death in the subacute phase, and only inhibition of the alternative pathway with CR2-fH
prevents evolution and spread of injury. The transient
nature of complement inhibition provides an explanation for the worse subacute outcomes in complementdeficient vs. complement-inhibited mice. Complement
deficiency will prevent the early pro-apoptotic and proinflammatory effects of complement mediated by the
anaphylatoxins and opsonins that trigger complementdependent phagocytosis, an effect that is also achieved
by complement inhibition. However, complement inhibition will allow for recovery of complement function at
the subacute phase permitting for critical neuroreparatory functions of the complement system that

Fig. 13 Schematic depicting complement activation and the effects of CR2-Crry vs. CR2-fH on complement-dependent effector mechanisms after
ischemic stroke

involve promoting neurogenesis, clearance of debris and
resolution of inflammation. To support this hypothesis,
we analyzed the temporal profile of CR2-fH in the brain
after a single injection and demonstrated targeted postischemic binding with diminishing levels during progression to the subacute phase, which would presumably
allow complement-mediated homeostatic and neuroprotective mechanisms to become operable as inflammation
is resolved.
The use of two different complement inhibitors in this
study allowed us to investigate the selective contribution
of the alternative complement pathway in secondary injury after stroke. Of the two complement inhibitors investigated, only CR2-fH improved neurological deficit
and locomotor function at 7 days after stroke. Improved
motor outcome at 7 days in CR2-fH-treated mice compared to CR2-Crry-treated mice and C3-deficient mice
is associated with significantly lower cortical cell death
in the CR2-fH-treated group. In addition, only CR2-fHtreated mice had significantly reduced hippocampal cell
death, and only CR2-fH-treated mice did not display a
reduction in neurogenesis markers in the SVZ. In
addition to maintaining post-stroke neurogenesis, CR2fH treatment also promoted significantly more neuroblast migration from the SVG compared to wt mice,
findings that correlated with improved performance on
spatial learning and passive avoidance tasks in the subacute phase after stroke. Since complement activation
products are implicated in acute injury as well as recovery and neurogenesis after CNS injury, a mechanism
accounting for the different subacute outcomes in CR2fH- vs. CR2-Crry-treated mice may be related to a difference in the extent of complement activation. Current
evidence indicates that following cerebral ischemia and
reperfusion, complement is activated by the lectin pathway [5–9] and amplified by the alternative pathway [4].
As outlined above, C3a and C5a have neuroprotective/
regenerative roles, and whereas CR2-fH treatment significantly inhibited C5a generation in the ipsilateral
brain for up to 3 days after stroke, C5a levels were still

significantly higher than in brains from CR2-Crrytreated mice. Thus, CR2-fH maintains a baseline level
of C5a generation through the subacute phase that correlates with improved overall post-stroke recovery, and
based on previous data, this likely occurs via the lectin
pathway. Differences in the extent of complement activation could also account for our observations that
CR2-Crry is more effective than CR2-fH at reducing
acute injury (lesion size), even though longer-term outcomes are worse. The concept of CR2-fH providing optimal longer-term protection by self-limited complement
activation is further supported by findings that high-dose,
but not low-dose, C3aR antagonism impaired post-stroke
SVZ neurogenesis in the subacute phase [14, 24]. CR2-fH,
but not CR2-Crry, also increased VEGF expression within
the ipsilateral hemisphere, and this may point to another protective mechanism of CR2-fH. Although the
role of complement in post-stroke angiogenesis has not
been investigated, C3a and C5a have been shown to
promote VEGF expression and pathogenic neovascularization within the retina in a model of age-related
macular degeneration [39]. We did not observe differences in angiogenesis with complement inhibition, but
it is possible that this may occur at later time points.
Regarding post-stroke neurogenesis, findings are mixed
on whether newly forming neurons make a functional impact on plasticity and recovery. Here, we investigated
neurogenesis and neuroblast migration 7 days following
ischemic stroke, and show that increased neuroblast
migration to the basal ganglia and hippocampal area in
CR2-fH-treated mice is indeed associated with improved performance on cognitive and memory tasks.
The effect of CR2-fH on neurogenesis and neuroblast
migration was also associated with increased levels of
NCAM and VEGF transcript and VEGF protein. Both
molecules have been studied in the context of neurodevelopment, with VEGF expression shown to induce
neuroblast proliferation and migration, while NCAM is
a neuronal adhesion molecule essential for the formation of chains of migrating neuroblasts during

Alawieh et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation (2015) 12:247

development [26] It is noteworthy that CR2 expression
in neural progenitor cells has been shown to regulate
hippocampal neurogenesis, and treatment with the CR2
ligand, C3d, was shown to reduce the number of proliferating neuroblasts in vivo [40]. It is therefore possible
that the CR2 targeting moiety of CR2-fH could be contributing to its function by competing with the interaction of C3d with CR2 expressed on neural progenitor
cells, although it is unlikely this represents a principle
mechanism of action since there is inhibition of neurogenesis in CR2-Crry-treated mice compared to wt.
The C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins are implicated in
promoting immune cell migration and infiltration, and
may also be involved in neuroblast migration. Interestingly, however, while we show that the significant reduction of C5a levels in the brains of CR2-fH-treated mice
is associated with decreased immune cell infiltration
(especially neutrophils), it is associated with enhanced
neuroblast migration. CR2-fH inhibited but did not
completely block C5a generation, and there may be different thresholds for anaphylatoxin stimulation or different mechanisms of action of the anaphylatoxins in
immune cell vs. neuroblast migration, and these data
again highlight the dual role of complement in injury
and repair.
Additional differences between C3-deficient and
complement-inhibited mice were the extent of microglial
activation and post-stroke mortality. C3-deficient mice
had significantly higher activation of microglial/macrophage cells compared to complement-inhibited mice.
The reason for the higher levels of microglial/macrophage activation in C3-deficient mice is not clear, but
may be related to the increased levels of striatal apoptosis found in complement-deficient vs. inhibited mice.
In this regard, C3 opsonization of apoptotic cells is
known to play a role in apoptotic cell clearance, and the
complete absence of this process in C3-deficient mice
may more severely restrict cell clearance and impair the
resolution of inflammation. In addition, C3-deficient
mice had a significantly higher mortality rate compared
to complement-inhibited mice. Treatment of C3deficient mice with an antibiotic eliminated this difference, indicating that increased mortality was due to infection. Complement plays an important role in host
defense mechanisms, and our finding here is also in accord with a previous study in which it was shown that
C3 deficiency, but not CR2-Crry treatment, increased
susceptibility to infection in a model of septic peritonitis
[16]. CR2-mediated targeting obviates the need for systemic complement inhibition [15, 16], and the current
data indicate that CR2-fH does not increase susceptibility to infection following experimental ischemic stroke.
Secondary infectious complications are a serious concern for stroke patients, and infection (septicemia and

Page 14 of 15

pneumonia) is a major cause of death following stroke in
the model we use here [29]. Other known causes of
mortality after stroke include hemorrhagic transformation, brain edema and, with regard to experimental
stroke, loss of mobility leading to malnutrition and dehydration of the animal.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we show that an acutely administered
dose of CR2-fH reduced injury and improved neurological and behavioral outcomes in the subacute phase
after stroke. These improved outcomes were linked to
reduced extent of cell death and increased neurogenesis
and VEGF expression. The improved longer-term outcomes in CR2-fH-treated mice compared to CR2-Crrytreated and C3-deficient mice, and the inhibition of
neurogenesis in CR2-Crry-treated and C3-deficient mice,
indicate that CR2-fH provides targeted and self-limiting
complement inhibition that dissects the dual role of
complement in injury and recovery after stroke. This
conclusion is supported by data showing that CR2-Crry
more completely blocks complement activation than
CR2-fH, as determined by comparing post-stroke brain
levels of the complement activation product, C5a. This
approach of alternative pathway inhibition offers potential advantages over systemic and/or regulated doses of
complement inhibitors that may be contraindicative to
long-term outcome. The current findings also warrant
further investigation into therapeutically relevant issues
such post-stroke therapeutic window, outcomes in older
mice with increased stroke risk factors or with preexisting cerebrovascular disease, and outcomes in preand post-menopausal female mice.
