Abstract  Ginsenosides, the major bioactive compounds
in ginseng root, have been found to have antioxidant,
immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory activities. In
the present study, we sought to investigate whether and
how ginsenoside Rb1 (GS-Rb1), the most abundant ginsenoside, can protect blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity following cerebral ischemia in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) animal model. ICR mice underwent MCAO
and received GS-Rb1 by intraperitoneal injection at 3 h
after reperfusion. We evaluated infarction, neurological
scores, brain edema, Evans blue (EB) extravasation, and
tight junction protein expression at 48 h after MCAO. We
further examined whether GS-Rb1 protected BBB integrity by suppressing post-ischemic inflammation-induced
activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX).
First, GS-Rb1 decreased infarction and improved neurological deficits in MCAO animals. In addition, GS-Rb1
reduced EB extravasation and brain edema and preserved
expression of tight junction proteins in the ischemic brain.
Moreover, GS-Rb1 inhibited expression of pro-inflammatory factors including nitric oxide synthase and IL-1β, but
increased expression of anti-inflammatory markers arginase
1 and IL-10 in the ischemic brain. Consistently, GS-Rb1
attenuated ischemia-induced expression and activity of

MMP9. Finally, GS-Rb1 reduced NOX-4 mRNA expression and NOX activity in ischemic brain. These results suggest that GS-Rb1 protects loss of BBB integrity in ischemic
stroke by suppressing neuroinflammation induction of
MMP-9 and NOX4-derived free radicals, and indicate its
potential for treating brain injuries, such as ischemia and
stroke.

Introduction
Physiologically, blood–brain barrier (BBB) exemplifies a
diffusion barrier, which consists of an interdependent network to segregate the central nervous system (CNS) from
the systemic circulation, and rigorously regulates paracellular permeability (Sandoval and Witt 2008). BBB has
long been described as the gatekeeper of the CNS, acting
to maintain the delicate homeostasis of the brain. In this
respect, the endothelial tight junctions (TJs) of the capillary
function as the primary mediators, limiting paracellular
movement of water, solutes, and ions. These TJs are tightly
regulated by highly specialized molecules, which can be
modulated by various intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways. Despite the fact that physiological characteristics of the TJs have been intensely investigated in the past
decades, less is known with regard to their regulation under
pathological conditions.
The two major mechanisms causing brain damages in
stroke are ischemia and hemorrhage. In ischemic stroke,
which represents about 80 % of total (Meyers et al.
2011), the integrity of BBB TJs can be severely impaired
following reduced or blocked circulating blood. As a

13

consequence, the disruption of BBB allows the harmful
substances, such as inflammatory molecules entering into
the brain, resulting in brain damage. Provided the complexity of events surrounding the different phases of TJ permeability, loss of BBB integrity is believed to be a consequence
of activation of multiple independent molecular signaling
pathways, which include ionic dysregulation, inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stresses, enzymatic activity,
and angiogenesis (Sandoval and Witt 2008).
Therapeutic strategies aimed at prevention of disruption of BBB and brain damage have been a major focus of
academic and industrial research for the past few decades
(Moroni and Chiarugi 2009). Understanding of the interrelation of the mechanisms addressed above is extremely
helpful for the development of new therapies. Ginsenosides, a special group of triterpenoid saponins, have been a
target of research in treatment of a variety of diseases associated with dysregulation of inflammatory signaling pathways. Ginsenosides are often classified into two groups: the
Rb1 group characterized by the protopanaxadiol presence
including Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd and the Rg1 group with
protopanaxatriol such as Rg1, Re, Rf, and Rg2 (Christensen
2009). As the most abundant bioactive form extracted from
ginseng, ginsenoside Rb1 (GS-Rb1) can effectively inhibit
inflammation in in vivo and in vitro models, including
brain tissues in cerebral ischemia animal model (Zhu et al.
2012). The aim of the current study is to further investigate
whether GS-Rb1 could suppress activation of the molecular
signaling cascades preceding disruption of BBB, and therefore preventing brain damage resulting from loss of BBB
integrity in the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
animal model.

of anesthetized mice with a 6–0 thread, which subsequently
reached the original site of MCA. The abrupt drop in cortical perfusion (<25 % of the baseline) was monitored by the
laser Doppler flowmetry (PRIMED Inc., Stockholm, Sweden). After 60 min of MCAO, the filament was removed to
permit for reperfusion (>75 % of the baseline).
Drug administration and grouping of subjects
After 3-h reperfusion, mice were randomly subjected to
receiving vehicle (normal saline or GS-Rb1 with concentrations at 5, 20 or 40 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection.
Mice were then killed at 24 or 48 h after MCAO for further
analysis.
Behavior evaluation
Neurological behavior was assessed according to a fivepoint scale system at 48 h after MCAO, as previously
described (Uchida et al. 2009): 0, no obvious neurological
deficits; 1, unable to extend the contralateral forelimb fully;
2, failing to walk straight or circling to the ipsilateral side;
3, learning to the affected side; 4, no spontaneous locomotor activity; and 5, being dead.
Analysis of infarct volume
The brains were harvested at 48 h after MCAO, and subsequently, processed to four 2-mm-thick slices. Slices were
incubated in 1 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC,
Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 37 °C for 10 min and then fixed in
10 % buffered formaldehyde solution for 24 h. Slices were
imaged with the infarct volumes analyzed by the software
(SigmaScan Pro, USA).

Materials and methods
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Male ICR mice, weighing 25–30 g, were provided by
The People’s Hospital of Pu Dong New Area. This study
was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol
was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal
Experiments of The People’s Hospital of Pu Dong New
Area. The IACUC committee members at The People’s
Hospital of Pu Dong New Area approved this study. All
surgeries were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. We
conducted MCAO with use of an intraluminal monofilament technique as previously described (Zhu et al. 2010;
Wang et al. 2014). First of all, we inserted a heat-blunted
and silicon-coated tip into the right internal carotid artery

Assessment of Evans blue extravasation
following MCAO
The assay of Evans blue (EB) leakage was used to evaluate BBB disruption following the experimental stroke, as
described previously (Huang et al. 2013). Briefly, 2 % EB
(4 ml/kg) was injected via the tail vein at 46 h after reperfusion. At 2 h after EB injection, mice were perfused under
anesthesia. Tissue samples were collected from the cortex and striatum, which were then homogenized by 50 %
trichloracetic acid and centrifuged. The absorbance of
supernatants was measured at 620 nm with infinite M200
PRO (TECAN, Austria).
Real‑time quantitative PCR
The tissue sample was collected from the ipsilateral
cortex. The total RNAs were extracted with use of the

Exp Brain Res (2015) 233:2823–2831	

TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). Reverse transcription
was performed using a reverse transcription kit (Applied
Biosystems, USA). PCR reactions were performed on
the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) as recently described (Wang et al. 2014). The
sequence of primers is as follows: IL-1β (forward:

ELISA
ELISA was used to measure IL-10 activity according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Wuhan Boster Biological
Technology LT, China).
NADPH oxidase activity assay
The activity of NOX activity was tested as previously
described (Liu et al. 2008). Tissue samples were homogenized in PBS. After centrifugation at 12,000g for 10 min,
20 μl of supernatant was transferred to a 96-well luminescence plate. After adding 80 μl phosphate-buffered saline
and 6.25 μl l M lucigenin, the reaction was started by adding 100 μM NADPH (Beyotime, China). Photoemission
was measured by at absorbance at 340 nm every 30 s for
5 min with Infinite M200 PRO (TECAN).
Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated at least three times. Data
were expressed as mean ± SEM with two-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s test. p < 0.05 is considered significant.

Western blot assay
The tissue sample was collected from the ipsilateral cortex. Proteins samples (30 μg) were separated on SDS-12 %
PAGE and then transferred onto PVDF membranes. The
blots were incubated with appropriate primary antibody,
anti-occludin (1:200; Invitrogen) or ZO-1 (1:500; Invitrogen) for overnight at 4 °C. Then membranes were washed
and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, USA). Protein
bands were visualized with an enhanced luminescence reagent (Millipore, USA) and photographed with ChemiDoc
XRS+ (Bio-Rad, USA).
Edema assessment
The brains were harvested at 48 h after MCAO and dissected into the left and right hemispheres. The dissected
hemispheres were weighed and placed into an oven at
80 °C for 48 h, followed by measurement of dried tissue
weight. We assessed edema based on formula: (wet weightdry weight)/wet weight.
MPO activity assay
Tissue samples were collected from the ipsilateral and
contralateral cortex at 48 h after MCAO. The myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured with use of the kit
(Jiancheng Company, China).

Results
GS‑Rb1 reduces infarction and improves neurological
deficits
We first assessed the effects of GS-Rb1 at different concentrations (5, 20, and 40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) on
infarction and neurological deficits. Figure 1a illustrates the
chemical structure of GS-Rb1. Treatment of GS-Rb1 (20
and 40 mg/kg) led to a significant decrease in cortical and
hemispheric infarction at 48 h following MCAO compared
with the vehicle group (Fig. 1b, c). Consistent with these
data, a significant decrease in neurological score has also
been observed in 20 and 40 mg/kg GS-Rb1 groups compared with the vehicle one (Fig. 1d), indicating the potential of GS-Rb1 in rescuing the neurological deficits after
MCAO.
GS‑Rb1 inhibits disruption of BBB following MCAO
We determined whether ischemia can induce BBB
disruption with use of EB leakage assay. At 48 h after
MCAO, EB leakage into the ipsilateral hemispheres was
significantly inhibited in GS-Rb1-treated mice at the
doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg than in vehicle-treated group
(Fig.  2a, b). To examine effects of GS-Rb1 effects on
post-ischemic edema formation, we evaluated brain water

EB extravasation results, 20 and 40 mg/kg GS-Rb1treated groups displayed a reduction in water content of

the ischemic hemispheres compared with vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 2c), suggesting that GS-Rb1 inhibits edema
following MCAO.

GS‑Rb1 prevents ischemia‑induced loss of tight
junction proteins

activity of MMP-9 typically promotes BBB injury. Consistent with the findings that GS-Rb1 suppressed pro-inflammatory gene expression but boosted anti-inflammatory
activity, GS-Rb1 significantly reduced MMP-9 mRNA levels at 24 h after MCAO (Fig. 4f).

In order to further evaluate BBB disruption following
MCAO, we assessed MCAO-induced loss of tight junction
proteins in the ischemic cortex. As shown in Fig. 3, despite
the fact that non-treated mice displayed significantly
decreased levels of two tight junction proteins, occludin
and ZO-1, in the ipsilateral cortex at 48 h after MCAO, the
loss of occludin and ZO-1 proteins in the ipsilateral cortex
was attenuated in 20 and 40 mg/kg GS-Rb1-treated groups.
GS‑Rb1 suppresses inflammation in the ischemic brain
BBB disruption may result from local inflammatory
responses in the ischemic brain (Huang et al. 2013). We
profiled gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines in the ischemic cortex at 24 h after reperfusion.
Compared to sham operation, MCAO resulted in a significant increase in mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory
genes such as iNOS and IL-1β. In contrast, 20 and 40 mg/
kg GS-Rb1 remarkably diminished MCAO-induced iNOS
and IL-1β expression (Fig. 4a, b).
In addition, 20 and 40 mg/kg GS-Rb1 considerably
increased mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory
marker arginase 1 (Fig. 4c) (Hu et al. 2012). ELISA results
further confirmed that the protein levels of IL-10, an important anti-inflammatory cytokine, were also increased in protective doses of GS-Rb1-treated groups (Fig. 4d). Increased
MPO activity in the brain suggests that cerebral inflammatory responses are associated with peripherally infiltrated leukocytes or locally activated microglia (Chen et al.
2008). Here we show that MCAO induced MPO activity in
the ipsilateral cortex, and 20 and 40 mg/kg GS-Rb1 treatment blocked ischemia-induced MPO activity in the ipsilateral cortex (Fig. 4e). Post-ischemic inflammation-induced

GS‑Rb1 represses NADPH oxidase expression
and activity following MCAO
Inducible production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
constitutes one of major mechanism underlying BBB disruption following stroke. NOXs are important sources of
ROS following cerebral ischemia and thereby play a critical
role in post-stroke BBB disruption. Three types of NOXs
have been identified in CNS: NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4
(Infanger et al. 2006). Here we found that 20 and 40 mg/kg
GS-Rb1 inhibited expression of NOX1 mRNA (Fig. 5a).
However, only ischemia-induced NOX4 mRNA expression, but not NOX2 mRNA, was attenuated by GS-Rb1 in
the ipsilateral cortex (Fig. 5b, c). We further tested NOX
activity in the ischemic cortex at 24 h after MCAO. As
expected, post-ischemic induction of NOS activity in the
ipsilateral cortex was significantly inhibited by 20 and
40 mg/kg GS-Rb1 treatment.

Discussion
We demonstrated in the present study that GS-Rb1 confers a robust vaso- and neuro-protection against ischemiainduced BBB disruption. Our results further suggest the
potential of GS-Rb1 in prospective therapy for ischemic
stroke.
It has been well documented that disruption of BBB is
preceded by activation of multiple independent molecular
pathways consisting of ionic dysregulation, inflammation,

oxidative and nitrosative stresses, enzymatic activity, and
angiogenesis. The ginsenosides’ potent anti-oxidative and
anti-inflammation activities play important roles on the
neuroprotective effects in insulted ischemic brain (Siddique
et al. 2000; Zhu et al. 2012). Especially, GS-Rb1 functioned as antioxidants (Liu et al. 2003) and exerted efficaciousness in protecting neurons from oxidative damage
(Kim et al. 1998). The cerebral vasculature is particularly
susceptible to oxidative stress insult (Lehner et al. 2011),
which in turn disrupts the maintenance of the BBB. From
this view, GS-Rb1 is expected to improve the integrity of
BBB against the MCAO-induced impairments, which is
further proved by this study and another study (Zhou et al.
2014). Besides, we tested another model of thrombolysis to observe the effects of GS-Rb1 on BBB integrity, as
thrombolysis is believed to induce BBB dysfunction. The
results also suggest the capability of GS-Rb1 protecting
BBB integrity against brain injuries, as evidenced by that
recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment
after thrombolysis induced significant cerebral hemorrhage
and Evans blue dye extravasation, while combination of
rt-PA + 40 mg/kg GS-Rb1 treatment partially rescued the
thrombolysis-induced impairments (Supplementary Figure
S1).
Phosphorylation is a major regulatory mechanism of
both transmembrane and accessory tight junction proteins.
Constitutive phosphorylation of the myosin light chain
(MLC) by MLC kinase (MLCK) in epithelial cells has been
shown to increase tight junction permeability (Shen et al.
2006). Protein kinase C (PKC) may be key regulator of
BBB permeability under ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-associated stress conditions (Fleegal et al. 2005). Calcium overload correlates with neural excitotoxicity, and elevations of
intracellular calcium lead to I/R-related BBB alterations.
Inflammation associated with I/R involves the induction of
cytokines and adhesion molecules, coupled with the activation and migration of neutrophils and microglia. TNF, IL-1,
and IL-6 can increase paracellular permeability in microvascular endothelial cells (Candelario-Jalil et al. 2007).
Cytokines induced production and release of chemokines
such as MCP-1, which is a major determinant involved in
leukocyte infiltration into brain parenchyma in ischemic
stroke (Huang et al. 2006). IL-1 induced neutrophil adhesion, and increased BBB paracellular permeability has
been shown to occur with loss of occluding and ZO-1 at
the junctions (Bolton et al. 1998). Oxidative stress significantly contributes to BBB disruption and vasogenic edema,
especially in reperfusion (Heo et al. 2005). The reactive
oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide and hydroxyl
radicals, can swiftly exceed capacity of the endogenous
scavenging mechanisms, thus leading to damage of cellular
macromolecules. ROS can also induce monocyte migration
across the endothelial monolayer (Schreibelt et al. 2007).

2829

NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and nitric oxide (NO) are important contributors to production of ROS (Bedard and Krause
2007). During ischemic stroke, many proteases including
heparanases and cathepsins are activated as well. Matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc endopeptidases that have been shown as the major mediators of I/R
outcomes associated with BBB tight junction disruption.
MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been the focus of many studies
of cerebral ischemia due to their substrate specificity for
fibronectin, laminin, and collagen. Increased MMP-2 and
MMP-9 have been identified with initiation of ischemia and
vasogenic edema (Montaner et al. 2001a, b; Chang et al.
2003; Rosenberg and Yang 2007). Apart from the mechanisms addressed above, lots of studies have shown that
angiogenic growth factors are involved in structural formation and stabilization of blood vessels, and mitigation
of I/R-associated TJ permeability and edema (Weis and
Cheresh 2005; Peters et al. 2007). Understanding the interrelation of these mechanisms is critical for development of
new therapeutic approaches.
Ginseng root has been extensively used in traditional
Chinese medicine, diet, or dietary supplement. Ginsenosides, a class of steroid glycosides and triterpene saponins, are the major bioactive compounds in the ginseng
root. Lots of studies have shown that ginsenosides possess
antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and
lipid-lowering effects in in vitro and in vivo animal models
(Kimura et al. 2012; Hou et al. 2014; Li et al. 2014; Wu
et al. 2014; Cho et al. 2015). Rb1 is considered as the most
abundant ginsenoside among more than 30 ginsenosides.
The present study shows that GS-Rb1 is capable of effectively inhibiting infarct, protecting BBB integrity, preventing loss of tight junction proteins, suppressing local inflammation, and reducing NADPH activity, presumably in turn,
production of ROS, suggesting that GS-Rb1 can be used
clinically in treatment of ischemic stroke.
Of note, nearly all of the outcome parameters we
observed in this study, including brain infarction, BBB
integrity, brain edema and inflammatory markers, and ROS
production, were affected by GS-Rb1 treatment, which
appears to be unspecific model of actions. Considering
the complexity of the in vivo study, it is quite difficult to
observe one parameter without affecting other parameters
in the whole tissue or organ, especially when these parameters are somehow connected; it may not be a surprise to see
that these parameters were affected by GS-Rb1. For example, since the impairment of BBB integrity after MCAO
was highly possibly connected to the loss of tight junction
proteins, GS-Rb1 is expected to enhance the tight junction
protein expression, given that it can rescue the BBB integrity insulted by MCAO. However, it is still possible that
the observed effects in this study may not be very specific,
which might require delicate in vivo or in vitro studies.

13

Pharmacologically, it is previously assumed that the
ginsenosides must be metabolized by human intestinal
microbes after oral use (Kim et al. 2013). Thus, GS-Rb1
needs to be metabolized to 20-O-d-glucopyranosyl-20(S)protopanaxadiol (compound K) by human intestinal bacterial flora and absorbed into the blood. The resultant product
of compound K is capable of efficiently inhibiting lipid peroxidation, TNF-α, NO, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and nuclear factor-κB
(NF-κB) activation (Li et al. 2014). The present study, however, shows that intraperitoneal injection of GS-Rb1 also
led to potent anti-inflammatory actions in a dose-dependent
manner. These results suggest that GR-Rb1 metabolized
to compound K is not required for its action, and GS-Rb1
per se can directly and effectively protect integrity of BBB
tight junctions and in turn prevent subsequent damage of
the brain. Our study provides further insights into pharmacokinetics of GS-Rb1. As a result, other routes of GS-Rb1
administration apart from oral use in treatment of ischemic
stroke are expected to result in.

Conclusions
In summary, GS-Rb1 has been shown to vigorously prevent
loss of BBB integrity following cerebral ischemia by negatively regulating local inflammation and NOX4-derived
ROS production. Our study will facilitate discoveries of
novel therapeutic approaches based on GS-Rb1 in treatment of ischemic stroke.
