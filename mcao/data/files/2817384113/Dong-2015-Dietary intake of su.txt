Background and Purpose—In our current food supply, sugar substitutes are widely used in beverages and other food
products. However, there is limited information about the link between dietary consumption of sugar substitutes and
stroke to date. This study sought to determine the effect of various sugar substitutes on the cerebral ischemic injury and
endothelial progenitor cells, which have been implicated to play an important role in vascular repair and revascularization
in ischemic brain tissues, in mice.
Methods—After treatment with sucrose and various sugar substitutes (the doses are in the range of corresponding acceptable
daily intake levels) and vehicle for 6 weeks, mice were subjected to permanent left middle cerebral artery occlusion, and
the infarct volumes, angiogenesis, and neurobehavioral outcomes were determined. In addition, the number and function
of endothelial progenitor cells were also examined.
Results—After long-term treatment with fructose, erythritol (sugar alcohols), acesulfame K (artificial sweeteners), or
rebaudioside A (rare sugars), the cerebral ischemic injury (both infarct volumes and neurobehavioral outcomes) was
significantly aggravated, angiogenesis in ischemic brain was reduced, and endothelial progenitor cell function was
impaired in mice compared with control. However, the similar impairments were not found in sucrose (with the same
dose as fructose’s)-treated mice.
Conclusions—Long-term consumption of sugar substitutes aggravated cerebral ischemic injury in mice, which might be
partly attributed to the impairment of endothelial progenitor cells and the reduction of angiogenesis in ischemic brain. This
result implies that dietary intake of sugar substitutes warrants further attention in daily life.   (Stroke. 2015;46:1714-1718.

A

s the negative impact of sugar consumption on weight
and other health outcomes has been increasingly recognized, many persons have turned to fructose and sugar substitutes (like artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols, and rare
sugars) as a way to reduce the risk of these consequences.1–3
But recently, accumulating evidences suggest that dietary
consumption of these compounds may also increase the risk
of metabolic disorder, which is one of major risk factors for
cerebrocardiovascular diseases, such as stroke.1–3 Stroke is
a devastating disease and the major cause of mortality and
morbidity worldwide.4 However, there is limited information
about the link between dietary consumption of sugar substitutes and stroke to date.
The integrity and function of the endothelium plays an
important role in the prevention of cerebrocardiovascular

diseases, such as stroke.5 Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)
are immature cells that can differentiate into mature endothelial cells and could be recruited from bone marrow to the
injury site to promote endothelial regeneration and neovascularization.6 In addition, EPCs have been used to successfully
improve function recovery in ischemic organs, including brain
after ischemic injury.5,7–9 Recent reports showed that EPCs
may serve as a new marker for stroke outcomes.5,7–9 Therefore,
EPC dysfunction and the consequent abnormality of endothelial regeneration may influence the susceptibility to cerebral
ischemic injury.
On the basis of these findings, this study sought to determine
the effect of various sugar substitutes consumption on the cerebral ischemic injury and EPCs in mice. Among sugar substitutes
widely used in beverages and other food products,1–3 fructose,

erythritol (sugar alcohols), acesulfame K (artificial sweeteners),
and rebaudioside A (rare sugars) were used in this study.

Methods
Male C57BL/6 mice (10–12 week, 20–25g) used in these experiments were obtained from Sino-British SIPPR/BK Laboratory Animal
Ltd (Shanghai, China). Mice were given fructose (Fru, 1.5 g/kg body
weight), erythritol (Ery, 15 mg/kg body weight), acesulfame K (Ace,
4 mg/kg body weight), rebaudioside A (Reb, 1 mg/kg body weight),
sucrose (Suc, 1.5 g/kg body weight), and water (Control) via drinking
water for 6 weeks. The doses of these sugar substitutes (Sigma) are in
the range of acceptable daily intake or estimated daily intake levels for

food additives approved by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or
European Union.2,3 Sucrose (Sigma), with the same dose as fructose’s,
was denoted as positive control. The body weight was monitored every
week, and fasting blood glucose levels were measured before and after
6 weeks of treatment. After long-term treatment, mice were subjected to
permanent focal cerebral ischemia, and the infarct volumes, angiogenesis, and neurobehavioral outcomes were determined according to published protocols and our previous work.10,11 According to our described
technique,7,12 mouse circulating EPCs and bone marrow–derived EPCs
were isolated and cultured, and the functions (migration, tube formation
and adhesion assay) of bone marrow–derived EPCs were examined. All
animals received humane care, and the experimental procedures were in
compliance with the institutional animal care guidelines.

Detailed methods are described in the online-only Data Supplement.

Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean±SEM. Statistical significance of difference among groups was performed using 1-way ANOVA followed by
Tukey post hoc analysis. A value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Effects of Sugar Substitutes on Fasting Blood
Glucose and Body Weight in Mice
There was no significant difference in baseline fasting blood
glucose levels among all the groups of mice (data not shown).
After 6 weeks of treatment, compared with control mice, fasting
blood glucose levels were slightly but significantly increased in

acesulfame K–treated mice but not in mice treated with fructose,
erythritol, rebaudioside A, or sucrose (Figure IA in the onlineonly Data Supplement). There was no significant difference in
body weights between sugar substitutes–treated mice and control animals (Figure IB in the online-only Data Supplement).

Sugar Substitutes Aggravate Cerebral Ischemic
Injury and Reduced Angiogenesis in Ischemic Brain
in Mice
The infarct volumes were significantly increased and the
corresponding neurobehavioral outcomes were markedly
impaired in sugar substitutes–treated, but not sucrose (with
the same dose as fructose’s)-treated, mice compared with
control (Figure 1A–1C). Furthermore, angiogenesis in ischemic brain was assessed at 3 days after cerebral ischemia. It

was found that capillary density was significantly lower in
the sugar substitutes–treated, but not sucrose-treated, mice
compared with control (Figure 1D). These results suggest that
long-term consumption of these sugar substitutes was able to
aggravate cerebral ischemic injury and reduce angiogenesis in
ischemic brain in mice.

Sugar Substitutes Impair EPCs in Mice
No significant difference in the number of circulating EPCs
(Sca-1/Flk-1 double-positive cells) was found among all the
groups of mice (Figure 2A). However, bone marrow–derived
EPC functions (including migration, tube formation, and
adhesion function) were significantly impaired in sugar substitutes–treated, but not sucrose-treated, mice compared with
control (Figure 2B–2D).

Discussion
This study showed the first direct evidence that long-term
intake of various sugar substitutes in the amounts currently
consumed impaired EPC functions and aggravated cerebral
ischemic injury in mice. However, the similar impairments
were not found in sucrose (with the same dose as fructose’s)treated mice.
Fructose in the amounts currently consumed has been proposed to be hazardous to the health of some people, but the
other 3 sugar substitutes used in the present work are generally regarded as safe for consumption.1–3 It is found that neither plasma glucose nor insulin levels are affected by sugar
alcohols (including erythritol) consumed.1–3 Five artificial
sweeteners (including acesulfame K) have been approved for
human use by FDA and have gained popularity as a solution
in maintaining the palatability of foods while substantially
reducing or eliminating caloric content for many years.1–3
Rebaudioside A, a representative of rare sugars, has been
regarded as safe for consumption in Asia and North America
for many years and was recently permitted for use in the
European Union and prized for its sweet taste and bulking
properties but apparent low energy status.1–3 However surprisingly, in this study, we found that, besides fructose intake,
chronic consumption of the other 3 sugar substitutes could

also led to a significant increase in cerebral ischemic injury
and reduction in EPC functions.
As aforementioned, EPCs participate in both vasculogenesis and vascular homestasis and have been used to successfully restore endothelial function and enhance angiogenesis
in ischemic brain tissue.5,7–9 Therefore, EPC dysfunction and
subsequent reduction of local angiogenesis in ischemic brain,
as observed in this study, may partly contribute to the aggravated cerebral ischemic injury produced by chronic sugar
substitutes intake (Figure 3). However, the mechanisms
underlying EPC dysfunction remain to be investigated in further studies
In addition, because EPCs has been implicated in playing an important role in vascular repair and revascularization in various ischemic organs besides brain tissue, and
EPC is inversely correlated with several cardiovascular risk
factors,5,7–9 EPC dysfunction produced by sugar substitutes
might also aggravate other ischemic diseases except stroke,
such as acute myocardial infarction, peripheral vascular ischemic diseases, and so on, which remains to be test by further
studies.
In summary, long-term consumption of fructose, acesulfame K, rebaudioside, and erythritol might aggravate the
cerebral ischemic injury, which might partly result from the
impairment of EPCs and the reduction of angiogenesis in
ischemic brain. This result implies that dietary intake of sugar
substitutes warrants further attention in daily life. Further
studies are required to better understand the mechanisms of
this response.

Expanded Methods
Animal Stroke Model
After 6 weeks of treatment, mice were subjected to permanent focal cerebral ischemia according
to published protocols and our previous work. 1,2 Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal
injection of 0.1ml 3.5% chloral hydrate per 10g body weight. A skin incision was made between the
ear and the orbit on the left side. After splitting of the temporalis muscle, a burr hole was drilled at the
junction of the zygomatic arch and the squamous bone, through which the stem of the left middle
cerebral artery (MCA) was exposed and occluded by electrocoagulation. Body temperature was
maintained at 37±0.5°C by using a thermal blanket throughout the surgical procedure. Behavioral tests
including Body Asymmetry Test and Beam Test were performed 3 days after MCA occlusion, and then
animals were euthanized and the brains were stained with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
(Sigma, USA) to determine the infarct volume as previously reported. 1,2 The regional cerebral blood
flow (rCBF) was monitored by Laser-Doppler flowmetry (moorVMS-LDF1, Moor Instruments Ltd,
England) before and after left middle cerebral artery occlusion. Mice with regional cerebral blood flow
that was more than 15% of the baseline were excluded from the experiment. 2 All the experiments
were performed in a random and blind fashion.
Behavioral tests
1) Beam Test— Beam walking across a bridge was used to assess motor coordination and balance
after stroke injury. Mice were trained for 5 days before MCA occlusion to traverse a narrow round
beam (5 mm diameter and 900 mm in length) to reach an enclosed escape platform. They were placed
on one end of the beam and the latency to traverse the central 80% of the beam toward the enclosed
escape platform at the other end was recorded. Data are expressed as mean latency to cross the beam of
3 trials. 1-3
2) Body Asymmetry Test— To measure motor asymmetry, mice were examined by elevated body
swing test as described. 1-3 Mice were examined for head swings while being suspended by their tails.
The direction of the swing, either right or left, was recorded when the mouse turned its head sideways
by approximately at a 10° angle to the body's midline. After each swing, the mouse was allowed to
move freely in a Plexiglas box for at least 30 seconds before taking the next test; the trials were
repeated 20 times for each animal. The frequency of head swings toward the contralateral side was
counted and normalized as follows: (number of lateral swings in 20 tests-10) /10×100%
Histological and Immunohistochemistry Assessment
After 3 days of permanent focal cerebral ischemia, the mouse was euthanized and the ischemic
brains were fixed by transcardial perfusion with saline, followed by perfusion and immersion in 4%
paraformaldehyde, before being embedded in paraffin.4 A series of 6-µm-thick sections was cut from
the block. Every 10th coronal section for a total three sections was used for immunohistochemical
staining. Antibody against CD31 single immunostaining was performed to detect the angiogenesis in
the ischemic brain.5
Quantification of circulating EPCs
The quantification of circulating EPCs in the peripheral blood was determined by flow cytometry
according to our described technique. 6,7. Briefly, peripheral blood was obtained by cardiac puncture
after mice were anesthetized. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB-MNCs) were isolated by

Histopaque-1083 (Sigma) density gradient centrifugation at 400 g for 30 min. The mononuclear
fraction was collected, washed in PBS (pH 7.4), red blood cells were lysed with ammonium chloride
solution (Stemcell Technologies), then washed twice with PBS and once with 5% albumin bovine
serum (BSA)/PBS (PBS-A). Freshly isolated PB-MNCs were re-suspended in 100 µ l5% PBS-A and
incubated with antibodies to Sca-1-PE (BD Pharmingen) and Flk-1-FITC (BD Pharmingen) for 1 hour
on ice. After washing and centrifugation, the cell pellets were suspended in 300 µl 2%
paraformaldehyde. Quantification of Sca-1/Flk-1 double-positive cells was performed with a BD
Flow cytometer (FACScan, Becton Dickenson). A non-stained sample was used to set up a threshold,
and the isotype specific conjugated anti-IgG was used as a negative control. 6,7
Bone marrow-derived EPCs (BM-EPCs) isolation and culture
Bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) were isolated from mouse tibia and femur
as we described, 6,7 and seeded in 6-well cell culture plates coated with rat vitronectin (1 µg/mL, Sigma)
at a density of 5×106 cells /well, and cultured in EGM-2. After 4 days of culture, nonadherent cells
were removed, and the adherent cells were further cultivated for 3 days. The the cells were then used
for in vitro studies. 6,7
In vitro cell function assays
Migration assay
A number of 5×104 cells were applied into upper Boyden’s chamber with M199. The lower
chambers were loaded with M199 supplemented 50ng/ml VEGF. EPCs were allowed to migrate for 24
hours, fixed and stained Hochest 33258 (Sigma, America). The number of cells on the lower side of the
membrane was counted at magnification ×100, and the mean value of 5 different areas was determined
for each sample. 8
Tube formation assay
Matrigel-Matrix (BD Biosciences) was placed in the well of a 96-well cell culture plate and a
number of 5×104 EPCs were plated in each well with EGM-2. After 18 hours of incubation, images of
tube morphology was taken and tube number was counted at random under 5 high-power fields
(magnifications ×100) per sample. 6,7
Adhesion assay
In adhesion assays, 1×104 cells were plated in 96-well plates coated with 1 µg/mL mouse
vitronectin. After two hours of incubation, non-adherent cells were washed away and adherent cells
were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst33528 (5×10-6 mol/L, 10 min,
Molecular Probes). A number of adherent cells were counted at random under 5 high-power fields
(magnifications ×100) per sample, and the mean value of the four wells was determined for each
sample. 7
Blood glucose level measurement
Mice were fasted overnight and blood glucose levels were measured from tail blood with the
Onetouch Ultra blood glucose monitoring system (LifeScan). 9
