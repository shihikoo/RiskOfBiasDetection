Abstract
Thrombin, a key player in thrombogenesis, affects cells in the
brain through activation of its receptors. Low levels of thrombin
activity are protective while high levels are toxic. We sought to
quantify thrombin activity levels and their spatial distribution in
brains of mice following reperfusion after ischemic stroke
focusing on infarct, peri-infarct and contralateral areas. In order
to ﬁnd out the contribution of brain-derived thrombin, mRNA
levels of both prothrombin and factor X were determined.
Furthermore, we assessed the effect of thrombin levels that
were measured in the ischemic brain on synaptic transmission.
We found that in the brains of mice following transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion, thrombin activity is elevated through-

out the ischemic hemisphere, including in peri-infarct areas
(90  33 and 60  18 mU/mL, in the infarct and peri-infarct
areas, respectively, compared to 11  3 and 12  5 mU/mL, in
the corresponding contralateral areas; mean  SE; p < 0.05).
Brain mRNA levels of prothrombin and, in particular, factor X are
up-regulated in the ischemic core. Hippocampal slices treated
with thrombin concentrations as found in the ischemic hemisphere show altered synaptic responses. We conclude that high
thrombin activity following reperfusion after ischemic stroke may
cause synaptic dysfunction.

An acute ischemic stroke occurs when an artery supplying the
brain becomes occluded, leading to the death of brain tissue and
focal neurological deﬁcits (Prabhakaran et al. 2015). Achieving
a timely vascular reperfusion is a fundamental factor in order to
reduce tissue injury and improve function (Prabhakaran et al.
2015). However, among patients that have undergone successful reperfusion, the neurological outcome is occasionally
variable and unpredictable (Ntaios et al. 2015; Seners et al.
2015). Whether changes occurring in the brain parenchyma
upon a period of ischemia may affect the neurological outcome
after reperfusion is currently a matter of debate (Benakis et al.
2015; Schoknecht et al. 2015). Indeed, a better understanding

Increased thrombin activity following reperfusion after ischemic stroke

of these events may possibly help in designing novel therapeutical strategies for improving the consequences of stroke.
Thrombin is a coagulation factor and a target for prevention
of cardioembolic stroke (Maggio et al. 2013a; Verheugt and
Granger 2015). In addition to its role in thrombogenesis,
thrombin has important pleiotropic effects through the
activation of its own receptor, the protease-activated receptor
1 (PAR1) (Bar-Shavit et al. 1986; Coughlin 2000). The
effects of thrombin on PAR1 are concentration dependent,
while high concentrations of thrombin have deleterious effects
and low concentrations may have neuroprotective effects
(Noorbakhsh et al. 2003; Xi et al. 2003). In the setting of an
acute ischemic stroke, thrombin has been detected in the
infarct area, possibly as a consequence of blood–brain barrier
(BBB) opening (Chen et al. 2012; Bushi et al. 2013) or as a
result of its local synthesis in the brain (Thevenet et al. 2009;
Stein et al. 2015) or both. In this context, thrombin has been
shown to cause synaptic dysfunction (Maggio et al. 2008,
2013b; Maggio et al. 2013c; Becker et al. 2014; Stein et al.
2015) and later on neuronal damage (Junge et al. 2003; Suo
et al. 2004; Hamill et al. 2009), through the activation of
PAR1 (Hamill et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2012). Indeed, the
toxic effects of thrombin in the central nervous system have
been shown in various ischemic models where neuroprotection could be achieved by PAR1 deletion (Junge et al. 2003).
Previously, using a novel and speciﬁc method for direct
quantitative detection of thrombin activity in brain slices, we
have found increased thrombin activity levels in the ischemic
hemisphere of mice brains following permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) (Bushi et al. 2013). In the
current study, we sought to quantify thrombin activity levels
and their spatial distribution in brains of mice following
transient MCAo (tMCAo) focusing on infarct, peri-infarct and
contralateral areas. The transient model is interesting, since in
contrast to permanent occlusion, it is expected that most of the
blood vessels will undergo reperfusion and that there will be
very little thrombin activity left over from the initial tissue
damage. This type of measurement of thrombin activity after
transient occlusion and reperfusion has never been described
before, and thrombin activity levels in the brain are not clear.
In order to ﬁnd out the contribution of brain-derived thrombin
that is possibly generated following tMCAo, mRNA levels of
both prothrombin and factor X were determined. Furthermore,
we assessed the effect of thrombin levels that were measured
in the ischemic brain on synaptic transmission.

Animal Care and Use Committee of The Chaim Sheba Medical
Center (Tel HaShomer, Israel), which adhere to the Israeli law on
the use of laboratory animals and NIH rules. Studies were carried
out on 8 weeks old male C57BL6 mice (Harlan Laboratories,
Israel). Anesthesia was performed with 2.5% isoﬂurane mixed in
oxygen and delivered through a facemask. Transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion was performed based on our previously
reported technique (Bushi et al. 2013). Brieﬂy, a silicone-coated
ﬁlament (Doccol Corp, Redlands, CA, USA) was inserted through
a small hole in the right external carotid artery. The ﬁlament was
carefully advanced up to 11 mm from the carotid artery
bifurcation or until resistance was felt. The ﬁlament was then
left in place for about 90 min and then removed to achieve
reperfusion. Throughout the procedure, the mouse’s body temperature was kept constant at ~ 37°C. Following surgery until
recovery from anesthesia, animals were kept in a closed chamber
heated with a lamp. Mice were killed 24 h after the procedure
using pental by I.P administration. Prior to sacriﬁce, motor
deﬁcits were measured for each animal and scored using a 5point neurologic severity scores described as follows (Longa
et al. 1989): 0, no neurologic deﬁcit; 1, mild (failure to extend
left forepaw fully); 2, moderate (circling to the left); 3, severe
(falling to the left); 4, very severe (depressed level of consciousness and failure to walk spontaneously).
In total, 16 mice underwent surgery. Mice that underwent tMCAo
were divided into two groups: in group A (n = 8) brains were used
for infarct area assessment and for mapping thrombin activity in the
ischemic versus contralateral hemisphere; in group B (n = 8) brains
were used to detect in high resolution the spatial distribution of
thrombin activity in the hippocampus slice (slice #7). In addition,
mRNA levels of factor X and prothrombin were determined in the
ischemic core (slice # 5–6). Six healthy mice were used as control.

All described methods were carried out in accordance with the
approved guidelines.

Thrombin activity assay and calculation of infarct area
Thrombin enzymatic activity was measured using a ﬂuorometric
assay based on the cleavage rate of the synthetic substrate Boc-Asp
(OBzl)-Pro-Arg-AMC (I-1560; Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland)
and deﬁned by the linear slope of the ﬂuorescence intensity versus
time, as described previously (Bushi et al. 2013). In group A,
following sacriﬁce, the brain of each animal was immediately
removed and placed in steel brain matrix (1 mm Coronal, Stoelting,
Wood Dale, IL, USA). First, the brain was cut sagittally in its
midline so the left contralateral and the right ischemic hemispheres
were separated. The brain was then cut starting at its anterior side
(starting at slice # 3, 2 mm anterior to the bregma), into coronal 1mm thick slices. In total, for each brain there were 18 coronal slices
(9 from each hemisphere). The slices were placed into 96-well black
microplate (Nunc; Roskilde; Denmark) contained the substrate
buffer. Measurements were carried out using a microplate reader
(Inﬁnite 2000; Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) with excitation and
emission ﬁlters of 360  35 and 460  35 nm, respectively. Upon
calculation of thrombin activity, infarct volume was assessed using
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and analyzed by the
Image J software, as reported previously (Bushi et al. 2013).

1 mm diameter tissue punches that were taken from four different
locations in the slice (named A–D; Fig. 2 right upper corner). Each
tissue sample was placed in a separate well in the 96 black
microplate and thrombin activity was measured using the thrombin
activity assay. Following tissue samples, the punctured slices were
stained using TTC in order to examine the relationship between the
infarct area and thrombin activity distribution.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction
RNA was extracted using Biorad Aurum 732-6820 (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) from frozen tissues. One
microgram of total RNA was used for reverse transcription using
high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems,
Rhenium, Israel). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
was performed on the 7900HT fast real-time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems), and prothrombin (PT) and factor X mRNA levels were
examined using Fast Start Universal SYBR Green Master (ROX)
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany), with the following primer
sequences: PT: 50 CCGAAAGGGCAACCTAGAGC, 50 GGCCCAGAACACGTCTGTG, factor X: 50 GTGGCCGGGAATGCAA,
50 AACCCTTCATTGTCTTCGTTAATGA. Hypoxanthine guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; 50 TGAAAGACTTGCTCGAGATGTCA, 50 CACACAGAGGGCCACAATGT) served as a
reference gene in this analysis (Sigma-Alrich, Rehovot, Israel). A
standard ampliﬁcation program was used (1 cycle of 50°C for
2 min, 1 cycle of 95°C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and
62°C for 60 s). The results are normalized to hypoxanthine guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase gene expression within the same cDNA
sample and calculated using the DCt method with values being
expressed as 2DCt 9 104  SEM.
Electrophysiology
Extracellular recordings in hippocampal slices were performed as
previously described (Maggio and Segal 2012; Katzav et al. 2014;
Maggio et al. 2015). Brieﬂy, mice were rapidly decapitated, and
400 lm horizontal hippocampal slices were used. Slices were
incubated for 1.5 h in a humidiﬁed, carbogenated (5% CO2 and 95%
O2) gas atmosphere at 33  1°C and perfused with artiﬁcial CSF
[containing (in mM) 124 NaCl, 2 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1.24 KH2PO4,
2.5 CaCl2, 2 MgSO4 and 10 glucose, pH 7.4] in a standard interface
chamber. Recordings were made with a glass pipette containing
0.75 M NaCl (4MΩ) placed in CA3 stratum pyramidale. Stimulation was evoked using a Master 8 pulse stimulator (A.M.P.I.,
Jerusalem, Israel) and delivered through a bipolar nichrome
electrode placed on the side of the recording electrode. Data
analysis was performed ofﬂine using Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic
Design, Cambridge, UK) and Origin 8.0 (Microcal Software,
Northampton, MA, USA) software.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS v. 22 for Windows
(IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Student’s t-test, one- or two-way ANOVA
followed by post hoc test was applied on normally distributed data
set. For data which are not normally distributed Wilcoxon signedrank test was used. Pearson’s R correlations were calculated between
the infarct volumes and thrombin activity. All numerical data are
expressed as mean  SEM, unless otherwise indicated. p values of
< 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Thrombin activity in the ischemic hemisphere following
tMCAo
In order to assess the effect of a transient ischemic insult on
thrombin in the brain, we measured thrombin activity levels
24 h following a tMCAo in mice. This procedure resulted in
a moderate neurological deﬁcits (median = 2) and infarct
area of 85  13 mm3. Thrombin activity measured in the
ischemic right hemisphere was signiﬁcantly higher compared
to the contralateral side (27  16, 31  13, 50  23 and
25  15 mU/mL in slices 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the right ischemic
hemisphere vs. 5  3, 5  2, 14  5 and 5  3 mU/mL in
corresponding slices of the left contralateral hemisphere;
Fig. 1a). Following log transformation, we veriﬁed normal
distribution of the data and equality of the variances.

Increased thrombin activity following reperfusion after ischemic stroke

Two-way ANOVA repeated measure model was used to
examine the association between slice number, brain side
(right, left), the interaction between the two and thrombin
activity. The model showed a signiﬁcant effect for slice
number (p = 0.0001) and brain side (p = 0.019), as well as a
signiﬁcant interaction between the two and thrombin activity
(p < 0.0001). In general, the source of the signiﬁcant
difference between slice numbers was from the comparison
of slices 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 to slice 6. Akin to this effect, the total
thrombin activity in the ischemic hemisphere was highly
correlated with the infarct volume (r = 0.71; p = 0.024;
Fig. 1b).
In order to get a better estimate of thrombin activity
distribution in the hemisphere and particularly in the infarct
and peri-infarct area, we sampled brain tissue from several
locations in the slice including the hippocampus (slice # 7)
and determined thrombin activity accordingly. Results were
compared to the contralateral slice. High thrombin values
were found in locations C and D of the ischemic hemisphere
and they were signiﬁcantly higher compared to the corresponding areas in the contralateral slices (90  33, 57  12
vs. 11  3, 16  5 mU/mL; p = 0.006 and 0.021, respectively, by Wilcoxon signed-rank test; Fig. 2). As expected,
these high thrombin values were found in infarct areas based
on TTC staining. In addition, thrombin levels were also high
in peri-infarct areas (locations A and B) per TTC staining.
These values were also signiﬁcantly higher compared to the
corresponding areas in the contralateral slices (36  15,
60  18 vs. 16  3, 12  5 mU/mL; p = 0.046 and 0.015,
for locations A and B, respectively, by Wilcoxon signed-rank
test; Fig. 2). All together, these data show that thrombin
activity is enhanced upon a transient ischemic insult.
Prothrombin and factor X mRNA are enhanced in the
ischemic hemisphere of tMCAo-treated animals
Upon brain ischemia, a BBB breakdown occurs (Chen et al.
2012; Giraud et al. 2015) and serum blood proteins such as
thrombin enter into the brain. Thrombin, however, is also
expressed in the brain with its concentrations being tightly
regulated in response to physiological and pathophysiological
events (Bushi et al. 2013; Stein et al. 2015). Indeed, it was
recently shown that in vitro ischemia, such as oxygen glucose
deprivation (OGD), leads to an increase in thrombin activity as
well as in prothrombin (the thrombin precursor) mRNA levels
(Thevenet et al. 2009; Stein et al. 2015). Thus, we sought to
evaluate here whether a tMCAo may similarly inﬂuence
prothrombin mRNA levels in the brain. In addition, as
prothrombin is converted to thrombin upon an enzymatic
cleavage by factor X (Ben Shimon et al. 2015; Stein et al.
2015), we also measured factor X mRNA levels. Interestingly,
factor X mRNA levels were signiﬁcantly higher in the
ischemic hemisphere compared to the contralateral side as
well as to those found in the brains of control animals (ischemic
hemisphere: 90  37; contralateral hemisphere: 6.1  2.5;

measured 24 h following 90 min transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion at different locations in the ischemic and contralateral
hemispheres respectively. The cylinder heights are proportional to
thrombin values (Inset at the left lower corner; mean  SEM (mU/mL

control: 0.5  0.2; p < 0.05) (Fig. 3a). Prothrombin mRNA
was also affected, yet to a lesser degree (0.66  0.13 at the
ischemic hemisphere vs. 0.39  0.06 in the control group;
p = 0.05) (Fig. 3b).
High levels of thrombin activity alter paired pulse responses
and increase spontaneous activity in hippocampal slices
The change in response to the second of a pair of stimuli is
considered to constitute a form of short-term plasticity. It
reﬂects a transient increase in transmitter release because of
residual calcium in the presynaptic terminal (Maggio and
Segal 2007). In addition, depression of the second response
in the pair also reﬂects the activation of local inhibitory
interneurons. To test the effects of different thrombin
concentrations on short-term plasticity, a paired pulse
stimulation (PPS) protocol was used. The protocol consisted
of two equal consecutive stimuli, delivered at varying
interstimulus intervals (ISIs) to CA3 stratum pyramidale,
with the ﬁrst stimulus evoking a 75% of the maximal
population spike. Results were quantiﬁed by calculating the
ratio between the amplitudes of the second and the ﬁrst
population spikes. Interestingly, upon PPS, thrombin

Spontaneous activity recorded in stratum pyramidale CA3
was also inﬂuenced by the different concentrations of
thrombin. Speciﬁcally, an increase in spontaneous activity
was detected at thrombin concentration of 60 mU/mL
(Fig. 5), with the highest effect found at concentrations of
80–100 mU/mL. Indeed, at these thrombin levels, the
frequency of spontaneous activity raised up to
23.16  1.82 and 21.25  1.28 respectively. Strikingly,
both 1 lM SCH79797 and 5 lM diazepam blocked the
effects of thrombin on spontaneous activity. Spike amplitude
was not affected. An overall one-way ANOVA testing the
effects of different thrombin concentrations on the frequency
of spontaneous activity showed a signiﬁcant effect (n = 12
slices for each condition; p < 0.001). Post hoc Tukey’s test
revealed a maximal signiﬁcance for thrombin concentrations
of 60 mU/mL (p < 0.01), 100 mU/mL and 150 mU/mL
(p < 0.001). All together these results show that high
thrombin concentration alter synaptic transmission in the
brain and predispose to enhancement of neuronal activity.

Discussion

Fig. 3 Up-regulation of coagulation factors gene expression in the
ischemic hemisphere of mice brain following transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (tMCAo). Brains were removed 24 h following 90 min
tMCAo and slices # 5–6 from ischemic versus contralateral hemispheres were used for the mRNA analysis method. Slices from healthy
brains were used as second control. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of

concentrations ranging from 30 to 100 mU/mL evoked an
enhanced facilitation of the response beginning at ISIs of
30 ms until 200 ms (Fig. 4). The highest effects were
recorded starting from 60 mU/mL thrombin. Strikingly, the
application of the PAR1 antagonist SCH79797 (1 lM)
completely blocked the effects of thrombin on PPS facilitation (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained when thrombin
was applied in the presence of 5 lM diazepam, thus showing
that high inhibition in the presence of thrombin may prevent
its effects. An overall two-way ANOVA testing the effects of
both time of ISI (factor A) and different thrombin concentrations (factor B) showed a signiﬁcant effect of either factor
A (p < 0.0001) or factor B (p < 0.0001) as well as the
interaction between them (n = 12 slices for each conditions;
p < 0.05). Post hoc Tukey’s test revealed a maximal
signiﬁcance between the two groups at 60, 100 and
150 ms (p < 0.001).

In the present study, we show that upon a tMCAo, thrombin
activity rises signiﬁcantly in the ischemic hemisphere
reaching peak levels at the ischemic core. Furthermore,
spatial distribution analysis indicated that high levels of
thrombin activity were also detected at peri-infarct areas.
Interestingly, similar range of thrombin concentrations that
were found in the ischemic hemisphere and applied on
hippocampal slices affect synaptic transmission and thus
neuronal function. Conversely, lower thrombin concentration
as found in the contralateral hemisphere did not affect the
synaptic transmission. Spontaneous activity recorded in
stratum pyramidale CA3 was also inﬂuenced by different
concentrations of thrombin in the same manner.
Thrombin has been previously shown to affect the nervous
system in several ways. While low thrombin concentration
seems to be beneﬁcial for brain functioning by enhancing
synaptic plasticity (Maggio et al. 2013c; Becker et al. 2014);
higher thrombin levels promote excitability (Maggio et al.
2013b) and cell death at later stages by directly triggering
apoptosis (Xi et al. 2006; Hua et al. 2007; Wang et al.
2012). The fact that high thrombin activity levels were found
also in peri-infarct areas suggests that thrombin may affect
the function and fate of peri-infarct areas following an
ischemic event. In this context, it is tempting to speculate
whether regulating thrombin activity upon transient occlusion of a major brain artery may affect the viability of the
tissue. Indeed, Jung et al. (Junge et al. 2003) and Hamill
et al. (Hamill et al. 2009) have shown that PAR1 knockout
animals exhibit minor cell death reduced infarct volume and
better recovery of function following ischemic stroke. In our
previous study, we have shown that pharmacological inhibition of either thrombin or PAR1 restores physiological

Fig. 4 High thrombin concentrations affect
paired pulse facilitation (a to f). Increasing
thrombin concentrations enhance paired
pulse responses recorded in CA3 stratum
pyramidale (d to f). These effects were
blocked by a PAR1 antagonist (SCH79797,
1 lM). Interestingly, enhancing inhibition
through application of 5 lM diazepam also
prevented the effects of thrombin. Traces of

synaptic plasticity that was blocked in OGD neuronal
networks. Moreover, we have found that hippocampal slices
prepared from PAR1-KO mice that were exposed to OGD
have normal synaptic transmission (Stein et al. 2015).
Thus, could thrombin be an important factor to control in
order to improve functional outcomes following ischemic
events? This may be of particular relevance as thrombin
inhibition is a major target for drug therapy in order to
prevent cardioembolic stroke in a selected population of
patients. Indeed, a better understanding of the consequences
of high thrombin activity upon stroke may help in designing
novel therapeutical strategies for improving neurological
outcomes.
The speciﬁc source of the measured thrombin in the
current study is yet unclear. Since brain ischemic events, as
well as additional pathological conditions (i.e. head trauma)
affect the integrity of the BBB causing extravasation of
serum proteins (thrombin being among them), the
contribution of brain-derived thrombin in such a context is

not clear. Novel ﬁndings have shown that thrombin is
synthesized in the brain with its levels being directly
regulated in physiological and pathophysiological conditions
(Ben Shimon et al. 2015). Speciﬁcally, upon OGD in vitro,
we have found that brain-derived thrombin rises and alters
synaptic plasticity (Stein et al. 2015). Even though better
experimental settings are needed in order to evaluate the
contribution of brain-derived versus blood-borne thrombin in
the brain following stroke, we here report that the brain
mRNA levels of prothrombin are up-regulated following a
tMCAo. Strikingly, factor X mRNA levels respond similarly,
thus suggesting that thrombin generation in the brain after
stroke may contribute to the ischemic process (Wang et al.
2003; Thevenet et al. 2009). In addition, high levels of
thrombin activity that was measured in the peri-infarct areas,
far from the ischemic core, may also indicate on the
contribution of brain-derived thrombin. In this respect, it
could be interesting to evaluate the time scale of the brainderived thrombin generation upon stroke and speciﬁcally

Fig. 6 Schematic description of the main results presented in this
study. Following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo),
high levels of thrombin activity were measured in the ischemic
hemisphere (Fig. 1a, Fig. 2). The sources of the high thrombin levels
are probably as a consequence of blood–brain barrier opening causing

extravasation of blood-borne thrombin (Chen et al. 2012) or as a result

understand whether newly synthesized thrombin occurs as a
short-term response to the ischemic stimulus or, alternatively,
at later stages. We are currently extending our studies in
order to better clarify this issue.
High thrombin levels (1 U/mL) have been shown to alter
synaptic transmission and excitability resulting in seizures
both in vivo (Lee et al. 1997) and in vitro (Maggio et al.

2013a,b), through an impairment of GABAergic inhibition
(Maggio et al. 2013b). In the current study, we investigated
the effects of lower thrombin concentrations (100 mU/mL
and less) similar to those detected in the brain following
tMCAo. Brieﬂy, we found that these concentrations are
able to affect synaptic functioning by increasing paired
pulse facilitation as well as network excitability. A PAR1

antagonist as well as diazepam were able to block the effects
of thrombin. While our data may suggest a possible role of
inhibition, we need to concede that these experiments (and
our conclusion as such) are far from indicating that thrombin
may directly affect inhibition at this concentration levels.
Additional pharmacological experiments together with intracellular recordings are needed in order to draw better
conclusions. Nevertheless, these current data may further
complete our previous results. Indeed, it might be that while
low concentrations of thrombin may more likely affect
inhibition, higher levels of thrombin may target excitatory
transmission as well. In two previous studies (Maggio et al.
2013c; Maggio et al. 2014), in accordance with the literature
on the systemic effects of PAR1 activation (Riewald and Ruf
2005; McCoy et al. 2012), we hypothesized that receptors
linked to different families of G proteins may be speciﬁcally
sensitive to determined thrombin concentrations and thus
mediate their distinct effects. These receptors may be located
on precise anatomical site within the hippocampus (Maggio
et al. 2013b) and consequently affect inhibition/excitation.
We are currently addressing this speciﬁc hypothesis.
Taken together, the evidence that thrombin may affect
neuronal function raises important questions on its possible
role in promoting seizures and epilepsy following an
ischemic event. While we are currently working in order to
further explore this possibility, it is interesting to speculate
what the role of drugs such as thrombin/PAR1 inhibitors may
be for either preventing or blocking seizures activity
following stroke.
In this study, we describe high levels of thrombin activity
24 h after a transient stroke in a mouse model in both infarct
and peri-infarct areas. In addition, brain mRNA levels of
prothrombin and factor X are up-regulated, and all of these
suggested that the sources of the measured thrombin are
probably both brain-derived and blood-borne thrombin. The
highest thrombin activity levels cause synaptic dysfunction,
and as described in our previous reports (Maggio et al. 2008;
Stein et al. 2015) and in the current study supports the
hypothesis that this synaptic dysfunction occurs through
PAR1 activation (Fig. 6).
The novelty of the present study is to show for the ﬁrst
time, quantitative measurement of thrombin activity after
transient artery occlusion. The results imply that the elevated
levels of thrombin in both infarct and peri-infarct areas may
play a role in the brain dysfunction seen 24 h following
tMCAo. The relevance of the levels of thrombin measured
both in damaged and undamaged tissue was assessed by
exposing normal mouse brain slices to these levels of
thrombin.
In conclusion, thrombin activity levels rise in the brain
following reperfusion after ischemic stroke and possibly alter
synaptic transmission in the ischemic hemisphere. Based on
these results and on the fact that PAR1 is expressed in the
human brain (Junge et al. 2004), it is likely that pharmaco-

logical intervention of thrombin-PAR1 pathway may provide
a potential therapeutic target for stroke patients by restoring
synaptic functions and potentially lead to a better neurological outcome.
