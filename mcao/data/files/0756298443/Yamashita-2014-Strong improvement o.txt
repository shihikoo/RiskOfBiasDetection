Background: Telmisartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker also called metabosartan,
is a promising solution for preventing cognitive decline or the incidence of dementia. Methods: We examined the effects of telmisartan on cholesterol transport-related
proteins (apolipoprotein E [ApoE]/low-density lipoprotein receptor [LDL-R]) and
microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in the brain of spontaneously hypertensive stroke resistant (SHR-SR). SHR-SR received transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 90 minutes at 12 weeks of age and then was divided into 3
experiment groups including a vehicle, low-dose telmisartan (.3 mg/kg/day), and
high-dose telmisartan (3 mg/kg/day). Results: The low dose served to improve
the metabolic syndrome of SHR-SR without lowering the blood pressure (BP)
whereas the high dose was used to improve metabolic syndrome while lowering
BP. Immunohistologic analysis showed that ApoE expression of cortical neurons
was strong in the vehicle group at 6, 12, and 18 months of age, and that this ApoE
expression pattern was very similar between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides
of cerebral ischemia. On the other hand, LDL-R expression of cortical neurons
was transiently increased at 6 months of age only on the ipsilateral side. Telmisartan
dramatically suppressed the expression of ApoE/LDL-R at both doses. There was
no remarkable difference in neuronal MAP2 staining between the 3 groups. Conclusions: These findings suggest that both low and high doses of telmisartan prevented
the activation of ApoE/LDL-R in SHR-SR after tMCAO, and that the antimetabolic
effect was regarded as the most important mechanism with few additional benefits
by lowering BP in this transient stroke model. Key Words: Alzheimer diseaseâ€”

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of
dementia worldwide and is characterized by cognitive
dysfunction with a distinctive brain pathology including

regional neuron loss, amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles.1 Cognitive dysfunction of AD is widely explained by a progressive synaptic loss initiated by

TELMISARTAN IMPROVE METABOLIC SIGNALS IN SHR-SR

amyloid-b (Ab) peptide and phosphorylated tau, a principal component of neurofibrillary tangles.
Recent studies suggested that hypertension is an
important risk factor of dementia, including AD2,3 and
vascular dementia,4,5 in which hypertension-related inflammatory responses are thought to induce amyloid pathology.6,7 In addition, metabolic syndrome, including
hyperlipidemia, is also related to AD pathology.8 Both
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) participate in cholesterol transport in
the brain, and ApoE plays a major role in modulating
Ab production and clearance in co-operation with
LDL-R.9-11
Meanwhile, angiotensin receptor blockers, which are a
widely used class of antihypertensive drug, have been regarded as a promising drug candidate for preventing
cognitive decline or the incidence of dementia.12,13
Telmisartan is a highly selective angiotensin type 1
antagonist of angiotensin 2 receptor with high-lipid solubility14,15 with a unique peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-gamma (PPAR-g)-inducing property. Thus, telmisartan is also called metabosartan as it exerts not only
an antihypertensive effect but also an antimetabolic syndrome effect. However, the long-term effects of telmisartan in relation to the chronic progressive dementia
model of rats after cerebral ischemia have not been fully
studied. We therefore examined the effects of telmisartan
especially against ApoE/LDL-R signals related to AD pathology in a hypertension model rat (SHR-SR) at 2 doses,
namely a low dose aimed exclusively at improving the
metabolic syndrome of rats, and a high dose for
improving both metabolic syndrome and hypertension
after a short period of transient cerebral ischemia.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Seven-weeks-old male spontaneously hypertensive
stroke resistant (SHR-SR) were provided by the Disease
Model Cooperative Research Association (Kyoto, Japan)
and placed on a basal diet. Animals were maintained
for at least 7 days before the experiment in a
temperature-regulated room (23 C -25 C) on a 12-hour
light/dark cycle. The rats were kept under fasting but allowed free access to water overnight before surgery.

Ischemia/Reperfusion Model
Transient focal ischemia was induced in rats by right
middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO) at
12 weeks of age (individual body weight, 260-280 g).
Briefly, the rats were anesthetized by inhalation of a
69%/30% (v/v) mixture of nitrous oxide/oxygen with
1% halothane using a face mask. A midline neck incision
was made, and the right common carotid artery was
exposed. The right MCA was occluded by insertion of a

2241

4-0 surgical nylon thread with a silicone coating through
the common carotid artery. Using this technique, the tip of
the thread occludes the origin of the right MCA. During
these procedures, body temperature was monitored
with a rectal probe, and was maintained at 37 6 .3 C using a heating pad. The surgical incision was then closed
and the animals were allowed to recover at room temperature. After 90 minutes of transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (tMCAO), the suture was removed to restore
blood flow (reperfusion). Sham control animals received
cervical surgery but without insertion of the nylon thread.
The animals were kept at ambient temperature until sampling, with free access to water and food.

Drug Preparation
The day after MCAO at 12 weeks, the previously
mentioned SHR-SR (n 5 51) were divided into the
following 3 groups, that is, the SHR-SR vehicle group
(SHR/Ve, n 5 19), the SHR-SR low-dose telmisartan
group in which the blood pressure did not fall (SHR/
Low, n 5 16), and the SHR-SR high-dose telmisartan
group in which the blood pressure fell significantly by
30 mm Hg or more (SHR/High, n 5 16), receiving daily
oral doses of .5% methylcellulose (MC, .1 mL) only
(SHR-SR vehicle group), .5% MC plus a low dose of telmisartan (.3 mg/kg/day), or .5% MC plus a high dose of telmisartan (3 mg/kg/day) for the subsequent 3, 9, and
15 months until killed by oral gavage, respectively. Telmisartan was provided by Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim
am Rhein, Germany) and was given to the 2 rat groups as
a suspension with 5% MC in .1 mL of water every day.
At 6, 12, or 18 months of age, the rats were transcardially perfused with 5 U/mL of chilled heparinized saline
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer
(pH 7.6) under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital
(20 mg/250 g rat). After decapitation, ratsâ€™ brains were
removed. All experimental procedures were approved
by the Animal Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama University. The present
study focused on the expression of ApoE, LDL-R, and
MAP2 as a single project to assess the effect of telmisartan
on SHR-SR after MCAO.

Immunohistochemistry
After their removal, the brains were immersed and
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with .1 M phosphate
buffer (pH 7.6) for 8 hours, embedded in paraffin, and 5
mm-thick sections were prepared for subsequent immunostaining. For LDL-R, ApoE, and MAP2 immunostainings, the brain sections were pretreated by heating them
3 times in a 500 W microwave for 5 minutes in 10 mM
(pH 6.0) citric acid buffer. These pretreated sections
were then immersed in .5% periodic acid to block intrinsic
peroxidase and treated with 5% normal horse serum in
50 mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing

2242

.05% Tween 20 to block any nonspecific antibody
response and were finally incubated overnight with
each primary antibody. The following primary antibodies
were used in this study: rabbit antilow-density lipoprotein receptor antibody (1:100; Epitomics, Burlingame,
CA), goat antiapolipoprotein E antibody (1:100; Millipore,
Billerica, MA), and mouse antimicrotubule-associated
protein 2 antibody (1:200; Millipore). Biotinylated antibodies for LDL-R, ApoE, and MAP2 staining were used
as the secondary antibodies, and specific labeling was
visualized by a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA). To guarantee the specific staining of primary
antibodies, a set of brain sections was also stained
without primary antibodies.

at 18 months (Fig 2, B).

Detection and Analyses
The previously mentioned stained sections were digitized with a digital microscope camera (Olympus BX-51;
Olympus Optical Co, Tokyo, Japan). Then the number
of LDL-R- and ApoE-positive neurons per 1 mm2 of cerebral cortex in hemispheric coronal sections was counted
on the right peri-ischemic lesion (ipsilateral) side and on
the left contralateral side. MAP2-positive neurons were
identified by their morphology, and their staining intensity was measured using Scion Image software.
Data are expressed as the mean 6 standard deviation.
Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures (multiple
comparisons). Planned comparisons were used for
Tukeyâ€“Kramer post hoc analysis. P , .05 was considered
to be significant. All statistical analyzes were performed
with Statcel statistical package (Statcel 2; OMS Inc, Tokorozawa, Japan).

Results
Immunohistochemical Analyses
ApoE Staining in the Cerebral Cortex
ApoE was strongly labeled in the cytoplasm of ipsilateral cerebrocortical neurons in the SHR/Ve group at 6, 12,
and 18 months of age (Fig 1, A, left panels). In the other 2
telmisartan groups (SHR/Low and SHR/High), the number of ApoE-positive neurons decreased significantly at 6,
12, and 18 months of age (Fig 1, A, center and right
panels). ApoE staining of the contralateral side was
similar but with reduced intensity (Fig 2, A).
Quantitative analysis showed that the mean number of
ApoE-positive neurons in 1 mm2 of the ipsilateral cerebral
cortex in the SHR/Ve group was 123.4 6 28.4 at 6 months,
125.7 6 41.0 at 12 months, and 129.5 6 39.4 at 18 months,
that in the SHR/Low group was 42.6 6 19.6 (##P , .01 vs.
SHR/Ve group) at 6 months, 47.2 6 12.9 (##P , .01 vs.
SHR/Ve group) at 12 months, and 51.2 6 23.0 (##P , .01
vs. SHR/Ve group) at 18 months, and that in the SHR/
High group was 31.9 6 4.2 (##P , .01 vs. SHR/Ve group)

LDL-R Staining in the Cerebral Cortex
LDL-R was positively labeled in the cytoplasm and
dendrites of cerebrocortical neurons on the ipsilateral
side at 6 months in the SHR/Ve group (Fig 3, A, a, arrowheads), which became weaker at 12 and 18 months (Fig 3,
A, d, and g). In the other 2 telmisartan groups (SHR/Low
and SHR/High), LDL-R was only weakly labeled at
6 months in the cytoplasm and dendrites of cerebrocortical neurons (Fig 3, A, b, and c, arrowheads), whereas the
number of positive cells in the cerebral cortex did not
change with age (Fig 3, A, e, f, h, and i, arrowheads).
On the other hand, LDL-R staining in the cerebrocortical neurons of the contralateral side was very weak at
6 months in the SHR/Ve group (Fig 4, A, a), but tended
to be stronger at 12 and 18 months (Fig 4, A, d, and g, arrowheads). In the other 2 telmisartan groups (SHR/Low
and SHR/High), LDL-R increased slightly, but not significantly (Fig 4, A, b, and c), and the number of positive cells
in the cerebral cortex increased with age (Fig 4, A, e, f, h,
and i, arrowheads).
Quantitative analysis showed that the mean number of
LDL-R-positive neurons in 1 mm2 of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex in the SHR/Ve group was 203.5 6 147.5 at
6 months, 11.7 6 10.7 at 12 months, and 24.1 6 22.2 at
18 months, that in the SHR/Low group was 40.4 6 24.6
(##P , .01 vs. SHR/Ve group) at 6 months, 24.8 6 20.2
at 12 months, and 33.4 6 17.5 at 18 months, and that in
the SHR/High group was 5.0 6 6.3 (##P , .01 vs. SHR/
Ve group) at 6 months, 10.6 6 6.4 at 12 months, and
80.9 6 58.9 at 18 months (Fig 3, B).
Separately, the mean number of LDL-R-positive neurons in 1 mm2 of the contralateral cerebral cortex in the
SHR/Ve group was 12.1 6 18.5 at 6 months, 44.8 6 74.8
at 12 months, and 48.2 6 15.9 at 18 months, that in the
SHR/Low group was 22.9 6 19.9 at 6 months,
61.2 6 1.3 at 12 months, and 39.0 6 10.9 at 18 months,
and that in the SHR/High group was 29.1 6 50.4 at
6 months, 76.3 6 90.3 at 12 months, and 70.0 6 38.6 at
18 months (Fig 4, B).

Discussion
Spontaneously hypertensive rats show chronic
hypertension,16 metabolic syndrome with insulin resistance,17 and immune alterations,18 eventually leading to
progressive neurobehavioral impairment.19 Recently we
reported that inflammatory cytokines such as MCP-1
and TNF-a are increased in SHR-SR, which displayed mi-

croglial proliferation with phagocytic morphology more
than Wistar rats.20 Telmisartan, an angiotensin receptor
blocker with potent AT1 receptor binding affinity, has
been shown to act both as an AT1 receptor blocker and
a partial PPAR-g activator. Telmisartan offered protection
to organs such as the kidney by reducing inflammation
and oxidative stress.21

and 18 months of age after tMCAO. Arrowheads represent LDL-R-positive neurons. There was no significant difference between the 3 experimental groups. Scale

In the present study, we found that ApoE expression of
cortical neurons was strong in the SHR/Ve group (mean
blood pressure [MBP] was 175.6 6 22.6 mm Hg at
12 months). However, telmisartan dramatically suppressed ApoE expression both with and without lowering
BP in the 2 groups: SHR/Low group (MBP,
168.9 6 24.0 mm Hg at 12 months) and SHR/High group
(MBP, 149.0 6 15.0 mm Hg at 12 months; Fig 1). This

pattern of ApoE expression is very similar between the
ipsilateral and contralateral sides (Figs 1-2), indicating
that the reduction in ApoE expression was mainly
affected by telmisartan (low or high doses) but not by
cerebral ischemia. On the other hand, LDL-R expression
of cortical neurons increased transiently at 6 months of
age only on the ipsilateral side of cerebral ischemia, and
was suppressed by both low and high doses of telmisartan

(Figs 3-4), suggesting that this increase in LDL-R was
affected mainly by transient cerebral ischemia, which
was then reduced by both doses of telmisartan. In the
expression of both ApoE and LDL-R, there was no significant difference between the low-dose telmisartan treatment
without
lowering
the
BP
(168.9
6
24.0 mm Hg), and the high-dose telmisartan treatments
with a lowered BP (149.0 6 15.0 mm Hg). Tsukuda et al22
reported that a low dose of telmisartan (.35 mg/kg per
day) ameliorated cognitive impairment induced by Ab in-

jection, and this effect was canceled by a PPAR-g inhibitor.
Thus, the effect of telmisartan against ApoE/LDL-R signals may mainly account for the activation of its PPAR-g,
but there was no further effect on lowering BP. In the present study, we focused on the cortical neuronal cells of
peri-infarct lesions, because these cells were strongly
affected by transient cerebral ischemia. However, there
was no remarkable difference in neuronal MAP2 staining
(Figs 5-6), except for a slight increase on the ipsilateral
side with both doses of telmisartan (Fig 5).

Overexpression of ApoE promotes the accumulation of
both Ab plaques23 and phosphorylated tau.24 ApoE is imported into neurons via its LDL-R port and is involved in
Ab production.25 We have previously reported that LDLR is expressed in conjunction with ApoE in the cortical
neurons of the peri-infarcted area after transient cerebral
ischemia.26 We recently reported that the production and
deposit of Ab increased in SHR-SR after MCAO. In this
article, we also showed telmisartan significantly decreased
the numbers of Ab-, ptau-, TNF-a-, and MCP-1-positive

neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of SHR-SR after
tMCAO20 Therefore, upregulation of ApoE/LDL-R signals may promote Ab production and deposit, probably
resulting in cognitive dysfunction related to AD, whereas
treatment with telmisartan strongly suppress ApoE/LDLR signals (Figs 1-3), eventually preventing the production
and deposit of Ab.20
In summary, the present findings suggest that both low
and high doses of telmisartan similarly prevent the activation of ApoE/LDL-R in SHR-SR after transient cerebral

TELMISARTAN IMPROVE METABOLIC SIGNALS IN SHR-SR

ischemia, suggesting that PPAR-g activation is the most
important mechanism than additional lowering of BP in
this transient stroke model. Because telmisartan has a
long-term neuroprotective effect against metabolic syndrome, it could provide a preventative approach in poststroke patients with hypertension at risk of AD.
