BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
From the clinical and experimental data available, statins appear to be interesting drug candidates for preventive neuroprotection
in ischaemic stroke. However, their acute protective effect is, as yet, unconﬁrmed.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Male C57Bl6/JRj mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and treated acutely with atorvastatin (10–20 mg·kg 1
day 1; 24 or 72 h). Functional recovery (neuroscore, forelimb gripping strength and adhesive removal test) was assessed during
follow-up and lesion volume measured at the end. Vasoreactivity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), type IV collagen and FITCdextran distribution were evaluated to assess macrovascular and microvascular protection. Activated microglia, leucocyte adhesion and inﬁltration were chosen as markers of inﬂammation.

KEY RESULTS
Acute treatment with atorvastatin provided parenchymal and cerebral protection only at the higher dose of 20 mg·kg 1·day 1. In
this treatment group, functional recovery was ameliorated, and lesion volumes were reduced as early as 24 h after experimental
stroke. This was associated with vascular protection as endothelial function of the MCA and the density and patency of the
microvascular network were preserved. Acute atorvastatin administration also induced an anti-inﬂammatory effect in association
with parenchymal and vascular mechanisms; it reduced microglial activation, and decreased leucocyte adhesion and inﬁltration.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
Acute atorvastatin provides global cerebral protection, but only at the higher dose of 20 mg·kg 1·day 1; this was associated with
a reduction in inﬂammation in both vascular and parenchymal compartments. Our results suggest that atorvastatin could also be
beneﬁcial when administered early after stroke.

Introduction
Among the numerous pharmacological strategies that have
been evaluated in ischaemic stroke, statins, or HMGCoAreductase inhibitors, appear as interesting candidates for
preventive neuroprotection. Clinical data support a dual beneﬁcial effect in stroke patients, reducing both frequency and
severity. The Stroke Prevention with Aggressive Reductions
in Cholesterol Levels study ﬁrst reported a reduction in stroke
incidence in secondary prevention (Amarenco et al., 2006).
Other studies have since also reported a positive effect on
stroke incidence in primary prevention, and a reduction in
stroke-related disability and mortality (Ni Chroinin et al.,
2013). Experimental studies have provided insights into the
underlying mechanisms involved and shown that statins
are beneﬁcial due to a pleiotropic mechanism of action. This
allows them to act on multiple targets at the same time,
resulting in a wide effect on the neurogliovascular unit
(Yanuck et al., 2012). Their preventive effect results from the
modulation of various pathophysiological pathways, such
as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and inﬂammation, and is
associated with a reduction in both neurological and
sensory-motor deﬁcits (García-Bonilla et al., 2012).
Moreover, statin withdrawal at the acute phase has been
linked to a negative effect on stroke recurrence, to poorer outcomes and to an increased risk of death (Rodríguez-Yáñez
et al., 2008; Flint et al., 2012a). Preclinical studies support
the hypothesis of a detrimental impact of statin withdrawal
via a rebound effect, the discontinuation of the treatment
leading to a worsened outcome (Jasińska-Stroschein et al.,
2011). In contrast the in-hospital continuation or the early
initiation of a statin treatment is associated with a better
chance of survival and a better outcome (Flint et al., 2012a,b),
suggesting an acute effect in addition to its well-known preventive, protective effect. Whether the same mechanisms are
involved in both the preventive and acute effects is still unclear.
There are scant data regarding the effect of statins administered during the acute phase of ischaemic stroke. Also, the preclinical evidence for a protective effect when the statin
treatment is initiated after experimental stroke is limited, the
beneﬁts being less obvious than in a preventive setting
(García-Bonilla et al., 2012). The underlying pathways and
targets providing cerebral protection are still poorly understood.
Clinical trials are currently ongoing and will provide insights
into its effects on stroke patients, namely the NeuSTART2
(NCT01976936) and the STARS07 (NCT01073007) trials.

Therefore, the present study was designed to assess the protective
effects of atorvastatin at the acute phase of cerebral ischaemia,
from a functional, parenchymal and vascular point of view,
focusing on the involvement of underlying inﬂammation-driven
mechanisms.

Methods
Animals
All experiments were performed in strict accordance with the
Ethical Committee in Animal Experimentation of Nord-Pasde-Calais (C2EA-75) and the European Union directive
2010/63/UE (agreement number 00455.02). The experiments
are reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines for
reporting experiments involving animals (Kilkenny et al.,
2010; McGrath et al., 2010). Male C57BL/6JRj mice (CERJ,
Saint-Genest-en-l’Isle, France), weighing from 27 to 32 g,
housed in a temperature-controlled environment with 12 h
light/dark cycles and fed ad libitum with a normal diet, were
used for all experiments. Animals were randomized after surgery. Experimental data were processed by an investigator
blinded for group allocation. The study included 27 sham animals – sham groups – and 108 animals subjected to middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) – ischaemia-reperfusion
(IR) groups – that underwent the whole protocol (24 or 72
h). This excluded non-ischaemic animals or animals with
incomplete infarcts (10 animals: at 24 h, one animal from
the IR + Veh group and one from the IR + atorvastatin (AT)10
group; at 72 h, two animals from the IR + Veh group, three from
the IR + AT10 group and three from the IR + AT20 group) and
animals that died before the end of follow-up (23 animals).

Experimental design
Mice were trained for 4 days before surgery for the adhesive
removal test. They were then subjected to MCAO for 1 h.
Atorvastatin base (gift from Genﬁt, France) was diluted in a
vehicle solution (0.05% carboxymethyl cellulose, 0.02%
Tween-20, sterile water) and administered orally twice a day
for 24 or 72 h following experimental stroke, the ﬁrst dose
being given 1 h after the induction of ischaemia. Functional
recovery was assessed 24 and 72 h after surgery (14 to 15
animals per group) (Figure 1).

Middle cerebral artery occlusion model
Transient focal cerebral ischaemia was induced by
intraluminal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery
(MCA) as previously described (Ouk et al., 2014a). Animals
were anaesthetized with i.p. chloral hydrate (300 mg·kg 1,
Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). Occlusion
lasted for 60 min, followed by a reperfusion period of 24 or
72 h. Sham-operated animals were subjected to the whole
surgical procedure except for the introduction of the occlusive suture. A rectal probe was inserted, and body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5°C with a heating blanket.
The right carotid arteries were exposed through a midline
cervical incision, and the common carotid and external carotid arteries were ligated with a silk suture. An aneurysm
clip was placed across the internal carotid artery, and an
arteriotomy was made in the common carotid artery stump,
allowing the introduction of a monoﬁlament nylon suture
with its tip rounded by heating with a ﬂame. The suture
was gently advanced into the internal carotid artery and
passed into the intracranial circulatory system into the
narrow lumen at the start of the MCA. The occlusion was
conﬁrmed by laser-doppler ﬂowmetry (Periﬂux 5000,
Perimed, France). After 60 min, the suture was carefully
removed until its tip was blocked by a ligature placed on
the common carotid artery to allow reperfusion. Sham
animals underwent the same procedure, except for the
introduction of the occlusive nylon suture.

Functional assessment
Each test was performed 24 and 72 h after surgery. Mice were
placed in the room for 30 min before the beginning of the
testing for habituation.

Neurological assessment (adapted from
Bederson et al., 1986)
The neurological deﬁcit was scored according to the following scale: 0 = no visible deﬁcit; 1 = ﬂexion of torso and of left
forelimb and/or default of extension of left forelimb when
5190

held by the tail; 2 = circles towards right when held by the
tail, paws on the ground; 3 = falls on left side when walking
and/or leans on left side when resting; and 4 = no spontaneous motor activity.

Gripping test
The forelimb gripping strength was measured with an automated grip strength meter (Bioseb, Vitrolles, France). While the
mouse was held by the tail, its forepaws were put in contact with
a grid connected to the device. It spontaneously tugged the grid,
and the corresponding gripping strength was measured. Each
animal was maintained in position for 5 s and tested three times
with a 5 min interval between each measurement.

Adhesive removal test (adapted from Bouet
et al., 2009)
The three parameters assessed in this test were the time to detect tape, giving information on the sensory deﬁcit, and the
times to remove the tape from the right (non-altered side)
and the left (injured side) forepaws. Mice were placed in a
persplex tub for a 60 s habituation period. A piece of adhesive
tape (0.4 × 0.4 cm2, 3 M, Cergy-Pontoise, France) was gently
applied to cover the palm of each forepaw. The order of placement (left or right paw ﬁrst) was alternated in every trial. The
animal was then placed back in the tub, and the times to detect and remove the tapes were measured with a maximum
limit of 120 s. Mice were trained every day for 4 days before
surgery (ﬁve trials/session/mouse), to limit the effects of
inter-individual variations. At the end of the training period,
the animals that could not take off both tapes within 10 s
were excluded from the study (two mice overall). The other
animals removed the tape from both forepaws in comparable
times before MCAO (left side: 5.00 ± 2.71 s; right side: 5.23 ±
2.64 s; P = 0.656).

Tissue preparation
Animals were killed 24 or 72 h after MCAO with an overdose
of pentobarbital (200 mg·kg 1, i.p.). For the ex vivo vascular
reactivity study, brains were quickly harvested, and the right
MCAwas excised. Brains were then frozen in isopentane and
cut later for infarct conﬁrmation. No quantiﬁcation was

Post-stroke effects of atorvastatin linked to parenchymal and vascular protection

made on these unprocessed tissues. For the molecular biology
study, brains were quickly removed, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80°C. For histological studies, animals
received an intracardiac infusion with a heparin-treated
saline solution and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were
removed, post-ﬁxed for 4 h at 4°C in PFA, cryoprotected
overnight in sucrose 30%, and ﬁnally frozen by immersion
in isopentane and stored at 30°C.

Vascular reactivity
Ex vivo vasoreactivity was assessed in a Halpern arteriograph
(Living System Instrumentation, Burlington, USA) on a proximal segment of the right MCA, perfused with an oxygenated
Krebs solution (pH = 7.4) kept at 37°C. The artery segment
was left to stabilize for 1 h at an intraluminal pressure of 20
mmHg. After preconstriction with phenylephrine (Phe)
10 4 M, the dose–response curve to CCh was determined
by stepwise cumulative addition from 10 9 to 10 4 M
(Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Genest-en-l’Isle, France). The viability
of the artery was veriﬁed at the end of the experiment with
SNP 10 4 M (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Genest-en-l’Isle, France).
Results are expressed as % increase compared with the
preconstricted artery diameter, using the following equation:
% relaxation = (Diameter CCh Diameter Phe)/(Diameter basal
Diameter Phe) × 100. EC50s for CCh were calculated using
GRAPHPAD PRISM 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).

Infarct volume quantification
Twenty micrometre thick cryostat-cut slices were stained with
cresyl violet (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Genest-en-l’Isle, France).
Unstained areas were deﬁned as infarct zones. Total, cortical
and striatal lesion volumes were quantiﬁed by calculating
the numerical integration of the infarcted areas on 12 successive levels using IMAGEJ software (Image J v.1.47a, NIH,
Bethesda, USA). Infarct volumes were corrected to compensate for the oedema, according to the following formula:
corrected infarct volume = measured infarct volume ×
(volume of left hemisphere/volume of right hemisphere).

to the treatment status of the evaluated samples (ﬁve animals
per group).

Immunof luorescence
After simultaneously blocking non-speciﬁc interaction sites
and of permeabilization with horse serum 10% and 0.3% Triton X-100 in KPBS, 14 μm thick cryostat-cut slices were incubated overnight with the primary antibody at 4°C: anti-type
IV collagen, 1:200 (Abcam), then with the secondary antibody: Alexa Fluor anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody, 1:500
(Invitrogen, Cergy, France) for an hour at room temperature.
Slides were mounted with Vectashield DAPI (Vector). Type IV
collagen is a major constituent of the basal lamina of blood
vessels and is used here as a marker for the density of cerebral
blood vessels. The ﬂuorescence intensities were read on a confocal microscope (LSM710, Zeiss, Le Pecq, France), and the
images were acquired with ZEN 2012 software (Zeiss) retaining
the same parameters for each acquisition. The scanned area
was 3.60 mm2, and the ﬁnal image was obtained combining
a z-stack to a tile scan. Images were processed to obtain the
maximum intensity projection image. The mean area occupied by the staining was measured using IMAGEJ on the maximum intensity projection images, keeping the same
threshold for each measurement. The evaluator was blinded
to the treatment status of the evaluated samples (ﬁve animals
per group).

Microvascular patency
Mice were injected i.v. with 100 μL of a solution of
FITC-dextran (2000 kDa, 10 mg mL 1) (Sigma-Aldrich,
Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). After 2 min, mice were decapitated. Brains were post-ﬁxed in 4% PFA for 24 h at 4°C,
embedded in OCT and frozen in liquid nitrogen; 40 μm slices
were cryostat-cut and mounted with Vectashield DAPI
(Vector). Due to its signiﬁcant MW, FITC-dextran can only
be distributed through patent microvessels, thus allowing
them to be visualized under the appropriate wavelength. Images
were acquired on a ﬂuorescence microscope (DMIRE2, Leica,
Nanterre, France) using the software METAMORPH (v. 1.5.0, Leica).

Immunohistochemistry – colorimetric method
After inhibition of endogenous peroxidases (30 min in methanol, H2O2 and PBS), non-speciﬁc interaction sites were
blocked with normal serum 10% for 1 h. Then, 14 μm thick
cryostat-cut slices were left in contact with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C: anti-myeloperoxidase, 1:500 (DAKO,
Courtaboeuf, France); anti-ICAM-1, 1:200 (Proteintech,
Manchester, UK); anti-ED1, 1:200 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK),
and then incubated for 3 h with the secondary antibody at room
temperature: anti-rabbit or anti-goat polyclonal antibody, 1:500.
Slices were then exposed to an avidin/biotin enzyme complex
(ABC kit, Vector, Burlingame, USA). The staining was revealed
by DAB/H2O2 exposure according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fast DAB Tablets Set, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin
Fallavier, France). The number of marked vessels (ICAM-1) and
cells (MPO, ED1) were counted on three successive slices in four
predetermined areas of 1 mm2 located in the ischaemic zone, including cortex and striatum, for ICAM-1 and MPO, and in the
boundaries of the ischaemic zone for ED1. The software IMAGEJ
(NIH) was used for all quantiﬁcations. The evaluator was blinded

Gene expression analysis
Brain microvessels isolation
Brain hemispheres were gently grinded with a Dounce homogenizer in ice-cold PBS and treated according to the
method previously described by Guo and colleagues (Guo
et al., 2010). The cerebral vessels collected were stored at
80°C.

Reverse transcription-PCR
Brain vessel fractions were homogenized in Extract-All
buffer (Eurobio, Courtaboeuf, France) with a mechanical
grinder, and total RNA was extracted from the samples according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR
was performed using a Light Cycler system (Roche Applied
Science, Meylan, France) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using Light Cycler-FastStart DNA Master SYBR
Green mix (Roche Applied Science). The protocol consisted

of a hot start step (8 min at 95°C) followed by 45 cycles including a 10 s annealing step at 60°C and a 10 s elongation
step at 72°C. To conﬁrm ampliﬁcation speciﬁcity, the PCR
products were subjected to a melting curve analysis. Quantiﬁcation data represent the mean of three experiments
from six animals in each group. TATA-Box Binding Protein
(TBP) was selected among other housekeeping genes for
normalization in real-time PCR analysis. The sequences of
the primers are as follows: TBP up 5′-GGCGGTTTGGCTAGGTTT-3′, low 5′-GGGTTATCTTCACACACCATGA-3′;
ICAM-1 up 5′-GGCCACCATCCTGTTCTG-3′, low 5′-TGGTAGACAGCATTTACCCTCA-3′.

Statistical analysis
All tests were performed using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago,
USA). The threshold for statistical signiﬁcance was set to
P < 0.05. Means were compared with one-way ANOVA, or
medians by a Kruskal–Wallis test if data were not normally
distributed. Data obtained from the functional tests were
compared by repeated measures ANOVA. If signiﬁcance
was reached, differences between groups were evaluated
with a post hoc analysis, using Bonferroni corrected post
hoc tests following ANOVA, or the Mann–Whitney U-test
following a non-parametric analysis.

Results
Effect of acute atorvastatin treatment on
functional recovery following experimental
stroke
The global neurological deﬁcit decreased over time, and atorvastatin (AT) had a signiﬁcant effect at the dose of 20 mg·kg 1
(F(1,41) = 6.18; P = 0.004). Scores were signiﬁcantly lower in
the IR + AT20 group than in the IR + Veh and IR + AT10 groups
(Figure 2A). The forelimb gripping strength increased over
time and was also signiﬁcantly higher in the IR + AT20 group
(F(1,41) = 9.16; P < 0.001) at the two time points 24 and 72 h
(Figure 2B). In the adhesive removal test, 24 h after cerebral ischaemia, there was no difference between groups. After 72 h,
the IR + AT20 group performed better, and detection times
were signiﬁcantly shorter (Figure 2C – F(1,41) = 4.21; P =
0.022). AT20-treated mice were also able to remove the piece
of tape stuck on the left forepaw faster (Figure 2D – F(1,41) =
3.90; P = 0.028). In sham-operated mice, the atorvastatin
treatment had no effect on the performances (data not
shown).
Total, cortical and striatal infarct volumes were signiﬁcantly reduced in the IR + AT20 group after 24 h when compared with the IR + AT10 and IR + Veh groups (F(2,23) = 6.91;
P = 0.004). The oedema was reduced in a dose-dependent
manner in treated animals (Figure 2E). After 72 h of treatment, a signiﬁcant reduction in the total and cortical
infarcts was still observed in the IR + AT20 group (F(2,26) = 5.53;
P = 0.010). Striatal lesion volumes did not differ signiﬁcantly,
and only the oedema was signiﬁcantly reduced in the IR +
AT20 group (Figure 2F).

Effects of acute atorvastatin on the vascular
compartment: study of post-ischaemic
endothelial dysfunction
Given the lack of effect of the 10 mg·kg 1 dose, we decided to
carry on the study using only the 20 mg·kg 1 dose that provides effective cerebral protection. There was no difference
in Phe-induced contractile responses in the four groups, the
myogenic tone was not impaired and responses to SNP were
comparable (Table 1). Following IR, the endothelial relaxing
response induced by CCh was strongly impaired in the
vehicle-treated animals (IR + Veh groups; Figure 3A and B).
Treatment with atorvastatin briskly reduced the postischaemic endothelial dysfunction, signiﬁcantly restoring
the relaxing capacity in the IR + AT20 group within 24 h
(Figure 3A). The effect persisted at 72 h (Figure 3B). The maximal response to CCh for these animals was signiﬁcantly
higher than in vehicle-treated animals, and similar to sham
groups when compared with the IR + Veh groups (Table 1;
P < 10 4 at the two time points). Atorvastatin also restored
the sensitivity to cholinergic stimulation after 72 h of treatment (Table 2). The EC50 values for CCh were signiﬁcantly
smaller in the IR + AT20 groups and comparable with sham
groups (P < 10 4), whereas the EC50 in the IR + Veh group
was more than 50-fold higher. In contrast to the IR groups,
we did not observe any effect of the atorvastatin treatment
on sham-operated animals; it did not modify the endothelial
response and sensitivity to CCh in these groups.

Effects of acute atorvastatin on the vascular
compartment: study of the microvascular
network
The semi-quantitative analysis of the immunoﬂuorescent
staining for type IV collagen revealed that there was no difference in the mean stained areas at 24 h. After 72 h of reperfusion, IR + AT20 mice exhibited a higher proportion of
stained blood vessels (Figure 3C).
The microvascular distribution of FITC-dextran was
reduced in ischaemic conditions, revealing a loss of microvascular patency. In treated animals, FITC-dextran was distributed more extensively through the microvascular network
(Figure 3D). Occasional capillary leakage was also observed
and was not modiﬁed by the treatment.

Evaluation of the acute anti-inflammatory
effect of atorvastatin on the parenchymal and
vascular compartments
Following 72 h of IR, ED1-positive cells could be detected in
the surroundings of the ischaemic area. The number of activated microglial cells was signiﬁcantly lower in the IR +
AT20 group (U = 0.00; P = 0.0079), giving evidence of a reduction of microglial activation in these animals (Figure 4A).
The parenchymal inﬁltration of polymorphonuclear
neutrophils was drastically diminished after 24 h (Figure 4B;
U = 3.00; P = 0.0303). At the vascular level, the expression of
ICAM-1 was signiﬁcantly reduced in the IR + AT20 group
(Figure 4C; U = 0.00; P = 0.0159). After 72 h of treatment,
there was no difference anymore between treated and untreated animals for both parameters.

n = 14; IR + AT20: n = 15. (E) In parallel, infarct and oedema volumes were smaller in the IR + AT20 group at 24 h. IR + Veh: n = 8; IR +

Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05 versus IR + Veh group; #P < 0.05 versus IR + AT10 group.

Discussion
We showed here that the acute administration of atorvastatin induces parenchymal and vascular protection following experimental stroke. These combined effects result in
an improvement in functional recovery. The modulation of
inﬂammation-dependent pathways holds a major place
here, contributing to the global cerebral protection we
observed.
The signiﬁcant and early improvement of functional recovery, associated with a reduction in infarct volumes, asserts
the global protective effect of acute atorvastatin, linking the
cellular protection to a positive motor and sensory impact.
Interestingly, this positive impact consisted of short-term effects, including a reduction of the global neurological deﬁcit

being seen as early as 24 h post-stroke, and mid-term effects
arising at 72 h, like the reduction in sensory-motor deﬁcits
evaluated by the adhesive removal test. There are limited data
showing the effect of an early statin treatment on the
sensory-motor deﬁcits following experimental stroke. Beginning the treatment simultaneously or in the hours following
reperfusion induced a reduction in the neurological deﬁcit 24
h later (Céspedes-Rubio et al., 2010; Cui et al., 2010). The effect of a statin treatment started later, that is 24 to 72 h after
experimental stroke, is better documented and has been
shown to improve sensory-motor recovery for up to 28 days
without reducing the lesion itself (Shehadah et al., 2010; Kilic
et al., 2014). When treatment was initiated even later, 7 days
after MCAO, it also helped to reduce cognitive impairment 3
months later (Shimamura et al., 2007). The long-term effects

of early treatment protocols such as ours, providing acute cellular protection and improving recovery, requires a proper
evaluation for conﬁrmation.
We chose to use rather high doses of atorvastatin based on
the data available at the time we designed our experiment.
Our study conﬁrms that high doses, 10 mg·kg 1·day 1 or
more, are necessary to achieve acute neuroprotection
(Céspedes-Rubio et al., 2010; Cui et al., 2010). In addition,
high doses appear to be the most effective when the treatment is initiated in the hours following stroke. In contrast,
when the treatment is started later, lower doses also seem to
be beneﬁcial. Chen and collaborators (2003) showed that
low atorvastatin doses, 1 and 3 mg·kg 1·day 1, but not a
higher dose of 8 mg·kg 1·day 1, had a beneﬁcial effect when
treatment was started 24 h after experimental stroke. In their
study, the 8 mg·kg 1·day 1 dose was even almost deleterious,
obliterating the positive effects on motor recovery, angiogenesis and neurogenesis exerted by the lower doses. These discrepancies with our results suggest that the pleiotropic
effects of atorvastatin not only depend on the dose but also
on the scheduled administration time of the treatment. Moreover, the administration route may be of importance as the early
administration of low doses has been demonstrated to be of
beneﬁt when administered i.v. but not i.p. (Prinz et al., 2008).
Of note, the statin treatment also appeared to interact in
a dose-dependent manner with recombinant tissular plasminogen activator (rt-PA), the only authorized treatment
for the acute phase of ischaemic stroke. Scheitz and collaborators (2014) recently showed that a previous statin treatment was associated with a greater risk for symptomatic
intracerebral haemorrhage in rt-PA-treated patients and that
the highest doses were not associated with a favourable outcome after 3 months. However, the introduction of a statin
treatment at the acute phase of stroke associated with
thrombolysis in naive animals seems beneﬁcial and responsible for a reduction in the rate and severity of secondary
haemorrhagic events, exerting a synergistic protective effect
(Liu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2009). Observational studies,
although limited methodologically speaking, seem to be in
5194

accordance with these ﬁndings (Ni Chroinin et al., 2013).
The prospective study STARS07 (NCT01073007) has been
speciﬁcally designed to address this issue and will give precious insight into this issue.
Our study highlights the role of vascular protection in the
cerebral protection provided by atorvastatin. Vascular protection is dual and is aimed at preserving (i) the endothelial
function, especially of large arteries in charge of the regulation of cerebral perfusion pressure, and (ii) the structure and
patency of microvessels enabling energetic and metabolic exchanges between blood, neurons and glia. Atorvastatin targets large resistance arteries, here the MCA, and participates
in the restoration of the endothelial function following IR.
The beneﬁt of the acute atorvastatin treatment is not related
to an effect on the basal tone but rather to a correction of
the post-ischaemic endothelial dysfunction. The endothelial
effect of statins is well described, but not in the context of an
acute neurovascular event. A long-term treatment ameliorates the endothelial-dependent relaxing response to ACh in
large resisting arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats
(Suh et al., 2010). Here, we showed for the ﬁrst time that atorvastatin protects the MCA against post-ischaemic endothelial
dysfunction when administered acutely after stroke. In
animal models, it has been shown that a preventive statin
treatment could increase the cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF)
(Endres et al., 1998; Berger et al., 2008) and preserve the aortic
endothelial function 24 h after transient MCAO (Kim et al.,
2008). In humans, statins seem to ameliorate vasomotor reactivity without markedly modifying the CBF (Giannopoulos
et al., 2012). This effect, on the CBF in animals as on
vasomotor reactivity in humans, is related to an improvement in endothelial function.
We also observed a structural and functional protective
effect at the microvascular level. We chose two different
markers: type IV collagen to visualize the architecture of
the microvascular network and FITC-dextran to visualize
patent microvessels within that network. Structurally speaking, the network appeared equally altered 24 h after experimental stroke in every group, but it appeared denser after

72 h in treated animals, implying an effect of atorvastatin
on the structure of the microvascular wall. Kawai and
collaborators (2011) previously showed that a 4 week
preventive treatment with atorvastatin protected brain
microvessels, the density of the network being preserved
24 h after MCAO. We also found that microvascular
patency was ameliorated. High MW FITC-dextran can only
be distributed along with the blood ﬂow in patent, open
microvessels. This technique allowed us to show that besides providing structural protection, the acute treatment
with atorvastatin also had a functional protective effect on
the microvascular network.
In both the macrovascular and microvascular dysfunction occurring after stroke, the establishment of interactions between endothelial cells and neutrophils is
involved. In microvessels, the adhesion of neutrophils,
and more broadly of leucocytes, contributes to the constitution of microclots impairing the perfusion of regions downstream of these (Greenwood et al., 2011). In arteries, we
have previously shown that the adhesion, rolling and inﬁltration of neutrophils play a major role in the establishment of post-ischaemic endothelial dysfunction (Pétrault
et al., 2005). Yet, ICAM-1 and neutrophils can also be
looked at from another point of view, not only as markers
of vascular injury but more broadly as markers of ongoing
inﬂammatory processes. Inﬂammatory pathways are activated from the ﬁrst hours following stroke and will take
place in both parenchymatous and vascular compartments
(del Zoppo, 2009). The resulting manifestation is polymorphous and evolves over time. Microglial activation is a classic marker for parenchymatous inﬂammation. Our results
are in accordance with the study led by Saito and collaborators (2014), who also found a reduction in microglial
activation in rats treated orally with atorvastatin 24 h and

7 days after transient MCAO. Indeed, microglia undergo a
series of morphological and functional modiﬁcations following ischaemia, characterized by speciﬁc patterns of protein expression (Yenari et al., 2010): cytokines, enzymes and
chemo-attractant factors, thus participating in tissue injury
and promoting leucocyte inﬁltration and astrocytosis.
Leucocytes, here more speciﬁcally polymorphonuclear neutrophils, are ﬁrst attracted towards the lesion and inﬁltrate
throughout the parenchyma to ultimately contribute to
the spread of tissue damage. Indeed, the pharmacological
depletion of neutrophils is associated with post-stroke protection (Gautier et al., 2009). These neutrophils can inﬁltrate because of a speciﬁc step in the inﬂammatory
reaction taking place in the vascular compartment, which
triggers the expression of adhesion molecules in endothelial
cells with which leucocytes will interact. We previously
showed that a preventive treatment with atorvastatin reduced the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM following
stroke (Ouk et al., 2014a). Hence, it appears that atorvastatin, even administered acutely, exerts a broad acute
anti-inﬂammatory effect affecting both vascular and parenchymatous compartments. We have reasons to believe that
the nuclear receptor PPARα is an important pharmacological
target underlying this anti-inﬂammatory effect, as it is activated by statins (Paumelle and Staels, 2008; Ouk et al.,
2014a) and its activation induces anti-inﬂammatory effects
(Ouk et al., 2014b).
This study shows that an early atorvastatin treatment provides cerebral protection at the acute phase of stroke leading
to tissue protection and improved functional recovery. It emphasizes the importance of neurovascular protection and
supports the rationale for the ongoing clinical studies, in
which the use of statins at the acute phase of ischaemic stroke
are being evaluated.
