Compounds that have the ability to both strengthen synaptic function and facilitate neuroprotection are valuable cognitive enhancers that
may improve health and quality of life, as well as retard age-related cognitive deterioration. Medicinal plants are an abundant source of
potential cognitive enhancers. Here we report that anemoside A3 (AA3) isolated from Pulsatilla chinensis modulates synaptic connectivity
in circuits central to memory enhancement. AA3 specifically modulates the function of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs)
by increasing serine phosphorylation within the GluA1 subunit, which is a modification required for the trafficking of GluA1-containing
AMPARs to synapses. Furthermore, AA3 administration activates several synaptic signaling molecules and increases protein expressions of
the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor and monoamine neurotransmitters in the mouse hippocampus. In addition to acting
through AMPARs, AA3 also acts as a non-competitive NMDA receptor (NMDAR) modulator with a neuroprotective capacity against
ischemic brain injury and overexcitation in rats. These findings collectively suggest that AA3 possesses a unique ability to modulate the
functions of both AMPARs and NMDARs. Concordantly, behavioral studies indicate that AA3 not only facilitates hippocampal long-term
potentiation but also enhances spatial reference memory formation in mice. These multifaceted roles suggest that AA3 is an attractive
candidate for further development as a cognitive enhancer capable of alleviating memory dysfunctions associated with aging and
neurodegenerative diseases.

INTRODUCTION
Dementia is a progressive decline of cognitive functions
such as learning and memory. It is a crucial problem in the
elderly population and a hallmark of age-related afflictions
such as Alzheimer’s disease. Age-related memory loss is
thought to be associated with a progressive weakening of
synaptic function and loss of excitatory synapses (Palop and
Mucke, 2010; Sheng et al, 2012). The enhancement or
maintenance of normal synaptic structures and function in
healthy individuals improves cognitive performance in daily
life and may also delay the initiation or slow the progression
of disease-related cognitive impairment.

Several strategies for cognitive enhancement have been
proposed, such as the modulation of synaptic protein synthesis, facilitation of synaptic function by modifying synaptic
transmission and connectivity, augmentation of adult neurogenesis, and prevention of neuronal death to protect deteriorating neural networks. Glutamate transmission, which is
propagated by the two major ionotropic glutamate receptor
subtypes, the AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs)
and NMDA receptors (NMDARs), is critical for regulating
synaptic strength in the hippocampus. These receptors are
highly expressed at excitatory synapses in the hippocampus;
they mediate basal excitatory synaptic transmission and regulate
synaptic plasticity, which are the fundamental molecular
basis of learning and memory (Anggono and Huganir, 2012;
Paoletti et al, 2013; Riedel et al, 2003). Although AMPARs
are responsible for mediating basal synaptic transmission,
NMDAR activation has essential roles in modulating
activity-dependent synaptic plasticity via calcium-mediated
signaling pathways and protein synthesis (Rebola et al, 2010).
Augmentation of ionotropic glutamate receptor function
enhances neurotransmission, which is believed to affect
memory and cognitive performance. This can be achieved by
regulating the receptors’ subcellular trafficking, duration of

channel opening, or associated scaffold proteins and downstream signalers (Yokoi et al, 2012; Kumar and Mayer, 2013).
Although ionotropic glutamate receptor activation is
essential for synaptic strength and cognition, their hyperactivation triggers excessive influx of calcium ions, resulting
in synaptic dysfunction and neuronal damage (Chang et al,
2012; Kawahara et al, 2004; Paoletti et al, 2013). NMDAR
overactivation is believed to be a major contributing factor in
the development of neurological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as depression, ischemia, Huntington’s
disease and Alzheimer’s disease (Chang et al, 2012; Paoletti
et al, 2013; Waxman and Lynch, 2005; Yamada, 2000). Thus,
therapeutic approaches that modulate the activity and
function of ionotropic glutamate receptors, so as to enhance
normal synaptic functions while preventing pathological
synaptic dysregulation, would aid in the treatment of
multiple central nervous system disorders.
Medicinal plants are a source of many compounds that
may exhibit capabilities to enhance cognition or prevent
cognitive impairment. P. chinensis (Bunge) Regel (bai tou
weng) is a common ingredient in several traditional Chinese
medicines. The decoction of its rhizome is widely used to
treat amoebic dysentery, vaginal trichomoniasis, and bacterial infection (Cheng et al, 2008; Ye et al, 1996; Zheng et al,
2010). This plant also exhibits sedative and analgesic effects,
suggesting effects on the nervous system. A marker
compound of P. chinensis, anemoside A3 (AA3), is a
triterpenoid saponin implicated in relaxing renal arteries
(Zhang et al, 2010) and protecting PC12 cells from apoptosis
(Gao et al, 2003). In this study, we have investigated the
beneficial effects of AA3 on synaptic and cognitive functions
in normal adult mice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and Antibodies
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, USA),
unless stated otherwise. Antibodies specific for pAKT, AKT,
pCaMKIIα, CaMKIIα, pERK1/2, and ERK1/2 were from
Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, USA); brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) antibody was from Santa Cruz
(Dallas, USA); PSD-95 antibody was from Thermo Scientific
Pierce; GluA1, pCREB, GluA2, and pSer831 GluA1
antibodies were from Millipore (Darmstadt, Germany);

pSer845 GluA1 antibody was from PhosphoSolutions
(Aurora, USA); and actin antibody was from Sigma. The
purity of AA3 was 495% according to nuclear magnetic
resonance analysis.

Animal Behavioral Tests
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care
Committee of the Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology. C57BL/6 (C57) mice (3–5 months old) were
administered AA3 daily by oral gavage throughout the
training in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Six-week-old
ICR mice were administered AA3 daily for 2 days before
starting the forced swim test (FST). ICR mice (3–5 months
old) were administered AA3 for 10 days before performing
in the open field (OF) exploratory test and passive avoidance
task (PAT). Eight-week-old Sprague–Dawley rats (300 g) were
used for middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); AA3 was
administered 6 h after ischemia. Detailed procedures for
animal behavioral tests are described in the Supplementary
Information. Experimenters were blind to the experimental
conditions in the animal behavioral tests.

Statistical Analysis
All data are expressed as arithmetic mean ± SEM. Long-term
potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal slices, miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) and dendritic spine
density in cultured neurons, and BDNF level and protein
expression of hippocampus were analyzed by unpaired
Student’s t-test. Neurotransmitter level in brain tissues,
NMDA-evoked current and neuronal cell death in cultured
neurons, cAMP level in hippocampal slices, neurological
deficit evaluation of MCAO, and probe trial of MWM, PAT,
FST, and motor activities in OF tests were analyzed by oneway ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls post-hoc test.
Paired pulse facilitation (PPF) in hippocampal slices, total
distance moved in the OF, and the acquisition training
of MWM were analyzed by two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA followed by post-hoc test. Po0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All statistical analysis was performed
using Graphpad prism v5.0.
Other experimental details are described in the Supplementary Information.

RESULTS
AA3 Increases Functional Excitatory Synapses
The suggested effects of P. chinensis on the nervous system
(Gao et al, 2003) prompted us to investigate whether and
how its major constituent, the AA3 compound, alters
neuronal functions. As part of our effort to identify cognitive
enhancers, we first determined the pharmacokinetics of AA3
in adult C57 mouse brain after a single-dose oral administration at 100 mg/kg. Quantitative analysis of AA3 indicated
that the compound was readily detected in both the plasma
and the brain at 10 and 20 min, respectively, after administration. The concentration of AA3 in the plasma peaked
at ~ 1 h (Cmax = 1673.1 ± 209.0 ng/ml) and declined to
o300 ng/ml at 4 h after administration. In the brain, the
level of AA3 peaked at ~ 1.17 h (Cmax = 129.5 ± 47.8 ng/g)
and decreased to o30 ng/g at 3 h after administration
(Supplementary Figure 1). After demonstrating that AA3
can enter the brain, we then examined whether the compound can potentiate synaptic functions in the adult mouse
hippocampus, a brain region critical for spatial reference
memory. Oral administration of AA3 (100 mg/kg) for
2 weeks did not affect the basal AMPA-mediated neurotransmission, as revealed by the fiber volley amplitude vs
fEPSP slope relation (Figure 1a), nor the short-term plasticity
as revealed by the relatively unchanged PPF at Schaffer
collateral fiber inputs onto CA1 pyramidal cells (Figure 1b;
interaction: F(6, 42) = 0.29, p = 0.938; drug effect: F(1, 7) = 0.87,
p = 0.383). These findings suggest that AA3 administration
does not alter the basal synaptic strength and presynaptic
function in mouse hippocampus. However, we showed that
AA3 administration can potentiate the LTP formation in the
hippocampal Schaffer collateral–CA1 pathway induced by
θ-burst stimulation (TBS), a cellular form of synaptic
plasticity closely associated with learning and memory.
TBS of the Schaffer collateral inputs to CA1 pyramidal
neurons induced stable LTP in mouse hippocampal slices as
shown by the persistent increase in fEPSP slope for at least
60 min (Figure 1c). Interestingly, the mice that received oral
administration of AA3 and trained in the MWM for 2 weeks
demonstrated an enhanced LTP (by 18.2 ± 0.5%, po0.001;
Figure 1c) when compared with the mice with MWM
training alone. These findings collectively suggest that AA3
enhances synaptic plasticity and may benefit memory
formation in the adult mouse.
Next, we examined whether AA3 potentiates synaptic
functions by regulating the structural or functional connectivity of hippocampal neurons. AA3 treatment significantly increased the frequency of AMPAR-mediated mEPSC
(~47% increase, po0.05; Figure 1d–f) in dissociated cultured
hippocampal neurons, indicating enhanced basal excitatory
synaptic transmission. Moreover, a slight but significant
increase in mEPSC amplitude was observed in AA3-treated
neurons (by ~ 14%, po0.05; Figure 1f). These results suggest
that AA3 can increase the number of functional excitatory
synapses and AMPAR abundance within individual synapses
in cultured hippocampal neurons. Concordant with these
functional enhancements, AA3-treated hippocampal neurons
also exhibited more mushroom-shaped dendritic spines
(Figure 1g and h), suggesting that AA3 can promote the
structural changes of synapses.
Neuropsychopharmacology

AA3 Increases the Phosphorylation of AMPAR Subunit
GluA1 in the Mouse Hippocampus
AA3’s facilitation of synaptic function was further characterized
by examining the expressions of synaptic proteins and downstream signaling molecules in adult mice that had received oral
administration of AA3. The abundance of AMPARs at synapses
in hippocampal neurons is correlated with synaptic strength
and thus hippocampal-dependent learning (Anggono and
Huganir, 2012; Riedel et al, 2003). Synaptic expression of
AMPARs can be controlled by their phosphorylationdependent insertion/removal from synapses (Lee et al, 2000;
Shepherd and Huganir, 2007). For example, the phosphorylation of AMPAR subunit GluA1 at Ser845 by PKA
(Esteban et al, 2003) and at Ser831 by CaMKII (Mammen
et al, 1997) are important for GluA1-containing AMPAR
insertion into the extrasynaptic surface and translocation to
synapses, respectively (Derkach et al, 2007; Lee et al, 2003).
Therefore, we examined whether AA3 regulates the synaptic
localization of AMPARs through GluA1 phosphorylation.
Indeed, AA3 administration increased GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser831 and Ser845 in the mouse hippocampus (~100
and 80% increases, respectively, at 100 mg/kg; Figures 1i
and j, and Supplementary Figure 2), whereas the total protein
levels of the receptors remained relatively unchanged
(Figure 1k and l, and Supplementary Figure 2). These
findings suggest that AA3 potentiates neurotransmission and
synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus via an AMPARdependent mechanism. The increase of GluA1 phosphorylation and its function in mice by AA3 may be specific to the
hippocampus. AA3 treatment resulted in an increase in both
the phosphorylated GluA1 protein and total GluA protein in
the prefrontal cortex (Supplementary Figure 3). Normalizing
the level of phosphorylated GluA1 protein with total protein
showed no enhancement of GluA1 phosphorylation between
different drug treatment conditions (Supplementary Figure 3).
These findings collectively suggest that AA3 enhances synaptic
transmission and plasticity in the hippocampus, possibly
through the modulation of AMPAR functions.

AA3 Increases Monoamine Neurotransmitter Levels
Monoamine neurotransmitters such as 5-HT and NE have
significant roles in modulating various physiological functions including mood and cognitive functions (Cahill et al,
1994; Geyer and Vollenweider, 2008; Normann and Clark,
2005). In particular, NE was recently shown to facilitate the
induction of CA3–CA1 LTP and hippocampus-dependent
contextual memory by increasing GluA1 phosphorylation
(Hu et al, 2007). Therefore, we sought to determine whether
AA3 regulates the expression of neuromodulators that
influence synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. AA3
administration increased 5-HT and NE levels in both the
mouse hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Table 1). Nonetheless, AA3 administration (30 and 100 mg/kg) did not
change monoamine oxidase activity in the mouse hippocampus (MAO-A: F(2, 9) = 0.100, p = 0.905; and MAO-B:
F(2, 9) = 0.743, p = 0.503; n = 4 brains), suggesting that the
effect of AA3 on monoamine neurotransmitter levels is not
due to the blockade of their degradation. Therefore, AA3
may also influence synaptic connectivity and strength by
increasing the presence of monoamine neurotransmitters.

AA3 Enhances Activation of Synaptic Signaling Pathway
Long-term memory formation requires the induction of gene
expression, which is coordinately regulated by various synaptic
signaling molecules such as cAMP, CaMKII, AKT, and
ERK1/2; these facilitate CREB-dependent gene transcription
and the subsequent modulation of synaptic plasticity (Waltereit
and Weller, 2003). To determine whether AA3 facilitates LTP
by modifying the phosphorylation and activation states of such
molecules, the effects of its administration on the activation of
various associated proteins were investigated. Indeed, direct
in vitro treatment of AA3 increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation
(Figure 2a and b, and Supplementary Figure 4a) and cAMP
production (Figure 2c; F(2, 6) = 5.63; p = 0.042) in acute rat
hippocampal slices. Furthermore, in vivo oral administration
enhanced the phosphorylation of CREB (Figure 2d, and
Supplementary Figure 4b) and various kinases including
ERK1/2, CaMKIIα, and AKT (Figure 2e–h, and Supplementary Figure 4c) in the adult mouse hippocampus. Again, the
regulation of these signal activations by AA3 was not observed
in the prefrontal cortex of AA3-treated animals, suggesting that
AA3 may have specific roles in the mouse hippocampus (data
not shown). BDNF, a neurotrophin family member, is a CREB
target gene. BDNF is crucial for hippocampal synaptic plasticity regulation and long-term memory formation (Minichiello,
2009). BDNF protein levels increased significantly in the
adult mouse hippocampus following AA3 administration
(100 mg/kg) for 2 days (by 9.5 ± 0.03%, n = 8, po0.01), as
determined by ELISA. Furthermore, western blot analysis
confirmed an increase in mature BDNF levels in the adult
mouse hippocampus following AA3 administration (Figure 2i
and Supplementary Figure 4d). These findings highlight the
variety of molecules and signaling pathways integral to
memory and cognition that are modulated by AA3.

AA3 Is an NMDAR Modulator
Although the various mechanisms by which AA3 influences
AMPAR signaling are crucial to the cognition-enhancing

properties of the compound, interaction with the NMDAR
might indicate a neuroprotective property as well. The
indication of P. chinensis on analgesic activity prompted us
to speculate that AA3 also modulates NMDARs. Thus, we
measured the whole-cell recordings from cultured hippocampal neurons, which showed that AA3 inhibited the
NMDA-evoked current at a holding potential of − 50 mV.
This inhibition increased with increasing NMDA concentration (Figure 3a and b; F(2, 30) = 9.635; p = 0.0006), required
the presence of NMDA (Figure 3c), and was mediated
through the inhibition of NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx
(Figure 3d). Moreover, AA3 similarly inhibited the NMDAevoked current at both negative and positive membrane
potentials (IC50: 18.48 and 20.19 μM at − 50 and +50 mV,
respectively; Figures 3e and f), suggesting that NMDAR
inhibition by AA3 is independent of membrane potential
(ie, voltage).
Given our observation on the effect of AA3 as an NMDAR
modulator, we examined whether AA3 exerts neuroprotective
effects against glutamate excitotoxicity and ischemic insult.
AA3 treatment significantly reduced NMDA stimulationinduced death of cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure 3g;
F(3, 12) = 8.081; p = 0.003), suggesting that AA3 protects
neurons from excitotoxicity by blocking excessive NMDAR
stimulation. Furthermore, AA3 administration significantly
reduced the extent of ischemic injury as evidenced by the
decreased infarct volume (F(3, 38) = 4.922, p = 0.006) and
neurological deficit scores (F(3, 38) = 3.579, p = 0.023) in the
MCAO ischemic model (Figure 3h–k). These results collectively demonstrate that AA3 is a non-competitive NMDAR
modulator that protects neurons from excitotoxicity.

AA3 Improves Cognitive Functions
The mechanistic effects of AA3 on both AMPARs and
NMDARs suggest AA3 is a potential cognitive enhancer.
Thus, it has the potential to improve learning and memory,
while also protecting neurons. We therefore investigated
whether AA3 improves cognitive function in naive adult

mice. To this end, we assessed the cognitive performance of
mice aged 3–5 months, an age at which they have completed
development but not yet begun senescence. We compared
learning and memory between AA3- and vehicle-administered mice in the OF (Figure 4a), MWM (Figure 4b), and
PAT (Figure 4a) tests, as well as examined changes in
depression-like behavior using the FST. In the first day of OF

training, AA3 administration did not significantly alter
locomotor activity (Supplementary Figure 5a; F(2, 57) =
0.041, p = 0.96) or change the preference for the peripheral
zone of the arena (Supplementary Figure 5b and c),
suggesting that AA3 does not affect locomotor activity. The
vehicle- and AA3-treated mice exhibited normal habituation
to the novel environment, as indicated by the decrease in

demonstrated that AA3 improved memory formation: AA3
did not affect the acquisition of learning of a hidden platform
location over the course of the 10-day training (Figure 4d;
interaction: F(18, 396) = 0.599, p = 0.901; drug effect: F(2, 44) =
0.008, p = 0.992). However, AA3-treated mice acquired
spatial memory more rapidly (Figures 4e and f) and were
able to identify the correct quadrant from which the hidden
platform was removed in the day-7 probe trial (Figure 4e;
Control: F(3, 84) = 13.99, p = 0.249; 30 mg/kg: F(3, 40) = 3.526,
p = 0.023; 100 mg/kg: F(3, 52) = 13.99, p = 0.0002). In contrast,
the control mice were unable to locate the correct quadrant
until day 10, the time when all the groups were able to learn
the location of the platform (Figure 4f; Control: F(3, 84) =
8.106, po0.0001; 30 mg/kg: F(3, 40) = 5.765, p = 0.002;
100 mg/kg: F(3, 52) = 12.05, po0.0001). The AA3-treated mice
did not enhance memory formation in the PAT (Figure 4g;
F(2, 27) = 1.057; p = 0.3613). These behavioral results collectively suggest that AA3 may have beneficial effect on spatial
reference memory. In addition to the evidence supporting
AA3’s memory-enhancement function, AA3-treated mice
also exhibited significantly reduced immobility in the FST
(Figure 4h; F(2, 27) = 5.652; p = 0.009), suggesting that AA3
may have an antidepressant-like effect.

DISCUSSION
Memory formation involves the rearrangement of synaptic
connections within the neural circuitry. Many factors including neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal
survival modulate neural circuitry functioning. The precise
control of the activity and functions of ionotropic glutamate
receptors is critical for proper synaptic transmission and
synaptic plasticity (Riedel et al, 2003). Here we report that
AA3, a triterpenoid saponin isolated from P. chinensis, has
multiple effects that modulate the functions of glutamatergic
systems. On the one hand, AA3 can potentiate AMPAR
functions by modulating receptor trafficking during learning
and memory processes; on the other hand, it prevents
NMDAR overactivation by directly blocking the channel
during neuronal excitotoxicity. AA3 regulates multiple
neural plasticity-related signaling pathways and likely exerts
its memory-enhancement effect by increasing LTP in the
hippocampus.
AMPAR function is regulated by the abundance, combination, and properties of AMPAR subunits at synaptic sites.
Identifying positive allosteric modulators of AMPARs is a
potential strategy for developing therapeutics against agingor disease-related cognitive impairments (Yamada, 2000).
For example, ampakines are a family of drugs that bind
directly to AMPARs and enhance their functions by slowing
the receptor deactivation and desensitization, resulting in a
prolonged synaptic response (Lynch, 2006). The present
study shows that AA3 facilitates AMPAR function by
modulating the phosphorylation status of AMPAR subunits.
GluA1 serine phosphorylation regulates AMPAR trafficking,
which is important for modulating synaptic strength and
thus memory formation. GluA1 serine phosphorylation can
be enhanced by multiple kinases including CaMKIIα, PKA,
and ERK1/2 on NMDAR activation; these synaptic signaling
pathways can in turn be modulated by monoamine neurotransmitters such as NE and 5-HT (Esteban et al, 2003;

Hu et al, 2007; Jitsuki et al, 2011; Mammen et al, 1997).
Given that NE and 5-HT levels in the hippocampus were
elevated after AA3 administration, it is tempting to speculate
that increased monoamine neurotransmitter presence is one
of the mechanisms underlying the AA3-stimulated increased
phosphorylation and synaptic expression of AMPARs.
Long-term memory formation requires gene transcription.
CREB is the key transcription factor essential for long-term
changes in synaptic strength and plasticity (Greer and
Greenberg, 2008). Its activation is important for strengthening synaptic connections by enhancing the transcription of
synaptic proteins in response to environmental changes.
CREB activation is induced after increased Ca2+ influx on
NMDAR activation and is modulated by various signaling
cascades. These cascades include elevated intracellular cAMP
triggered by the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases, and/or monoamine
neurotransmitter receptors (Greer and Greenberg, 2008).
Thus, increasing CREB activation is another potential therapeutic strategy for developing cognitive enhancers (Tully
et al, 2003). Whether AA3 triggers the activation of cAMPdependent or other synaptic signaling pathways via GPCR
stimulation awaits further investigation. Nonetheless, the
AA3-induced cellular and molecular modifications in the
brain are associated with improved memory performance.
In addition to being crucial for overall neural health,
neuronal survival can be specifically beneficial for modulating neuronal connectivity and synaptic transmission
strength. Therefore, homeostatic maintenance of NMDAR
activity is critical for the maintenance of neuronal health and
cognitive functions. Under physiological conditions, NMDAR
is important in mediating synaptic plasticity via calciummediated signaling pathways (Rebola et al, 2010). However,
NMDAR hyperactivation under pathological conditions
leads to excessive Ca2+ influx into neurons, resulting in
excitotoxicity (Talantova et al, 2013; Waxman and Lynch,
2005). Thus, it would be desirable to develop an ‘optimal’
NMDAR modulator that blocks ‘excessive’ receptor activity,
especially during prolonged depolarization, but exerts little
effect under normal physiological conditions. Most identified
NMDAR antagonists such as MK801 do not fall into this
category, because they perturb normal neurotransmission
and cause cognitive impairment in normal subjects
(Lukoyanov and Paula-Barbosa, 2000; Manahan-Vaughan
et al, 2008). Another NMDAR antagonist, memantine, which
is used as a therapeutic drug for Alzheimer’s disease, enhances
cognitive function. As a low-affinity NMDAR antagonist,
memantine selectively blocks the hyperactivated NMDAR
under pathological conditions (Muller et al, 1995; Parsons
et al, 2007), a feature that may underlie its beneficial effect on
cognitive function. Here we show that AA3 is also a lowaffinity non-competitive NMDAR modulator that inhibits
NMDAR activity with slow on-rate inhibition and voltageindependent properties (Figure 3). These properties allow the
compound to protect neurons against neurological insults
under prolonged depolarization with minimal impact on
normal neuronal activity, suggesting that AA3 is a potential
therapeutic candidate for protecting against neurodegeneration and alleviating cognitive dysfunctions. Finally, the
NMDAR antagonist ketamine recently demonstrated antidepressant-like effects. Its administration increased synapse
formation and exhibited an antidepressant-like effect

(Li et al, 2010). Consistent with the antagonistic effect of
AA3 on NMDAR function, AA3-treated mice exhibited
improved performance in the FST, raising another possibility
that AA3 can be developed as a potential therapeutic target
for depression.
In conclusion, AA3 is a natural triterpenoid saponin that
enhances synaptic plasticity in the adult mouse hippocampus
and facilitates spatial memory in adult mice. Thus, this small
molecule may have beneficial effects on cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s
disease. AA3 is a compelling subject for further study as well
as further development for various clinical applications.
