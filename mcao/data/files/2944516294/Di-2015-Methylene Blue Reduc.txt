The treatment of stroke is limited by a short therapeutic window and a lack of effective clinical drugs. Methylene blue (MB) has
been used in laboratories and clinics since the 1890s. Few studies have reported the neuroprotective role of MB in cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury. However, whether and how MB protects against acute cerebral ischemia (ACI) injury was unclear. In this study,
we investigated the effect of MB on this injury and revealed that MB protected against ACI injury by augmenting mitophagy. Using
a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, we demonstrated that MB improved neurological function and reduced
the infarct volume and necrosis after ACI injury. These improvements depended on the effect of MB on mitochondrial structure and
function. ACI caused the disorder and disintegration of mitochondrial structure, while MB ameliorated the destruction of mitochondria. In addition, mitophagy was inhibited at 24 h after stroke and MB augmented mitophagy. In an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model in vitro, we further revealed that the elevation of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by MB under OGD
conditions mediated the augmented mitophagy. In contrast, exacerbating the decline of MMP during OGD abolished the MB-induced activation of mitophagy. Taken together, MB promotes mitophagy by maintaining the MMP at a relatively high level, which
contributes to a decrease in necrosis and an improvement in neurological function, thereby protecting against ACI injury.

INTRODUCTION
Stroke is a primary cause of disability
and death worldwide. The treatment of
stroke is constrained by a therapeutic
window consisting of a few hours, and
effective drugs for the treatment of
stroke are extremely scarce. Methylene
blue (MB) has been demonstrated to perform diverse biological functions and has
been used for various medical applications (1). MB readily crosses the
blood–brain barrier and accumulates in

the mitochondrial matrix (2,3); therefore,
its biological functions primarily involve
improving mitochondrial functions, such
as enhancing cytochrome c oxidase activity (4), oxygen consumption (5, 6) and
ATP production (7) and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (8).
Clinically, MB has been approved by the
FDA for methemoglobinemia and as an
antidote to cyanide poisoning (9,10). A
few studies have shown that MB reduces
cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury

(11–13). In fact, fewer than 5% of patients
with ischemic stroke can obtain thrombolytic treatment in the therapeutic window (14). That is, more than 95% of patients suffer permanent cerebral ischemia
due to not receiving reperfusion in time.
Acute cerebral ischemia (ACI) is one of
the most common cerebral vascular diseases and here refers to the process
whereby artery blockage causes brain tissue ischemia without reperfusion, resulting in brain dysfunction. The importance
and necessity of ACI treatment lies in
early intervention, without considering
reperfusion or not, to reduce the mortality and disability. Therefore, the research
and development of neuroprotective
drugs for the treatment of acute ischemic
stroke is clinically significant. Here, we
demonstrate for the first time that MB attenuates ACI injury and that its protective effect is related to the induction of
mitophagy.
Mitochondria are the principal target of
ischemic injury (15). Ischemia generally

RESEARCH ARTICLE

leads to mitochondrial dysfunction (16,17).
Dysfunctional mitochondria can be selectively eliminated via mitophagy (18–20).
In this process, damaged mitochondria are
enveloped by double-membrane structures known as autophagosomes, which
are then delivered to lysosomes for degradation (21–23). Thus, mitophagy plays a
crucial role in controlling the quality of
mitochondria by preventing the generation of ROS by dysfunctional mitochondria (24,25). Deficiency in mitophagy is associated with neurodegenerative diseases
such as Parkinson’s disease (26,27), Alzheimer’s disease (28,29) and Huntington’s
disease (30). Stroke is another type of neurodegenerative disease. However, whether
mitophagy is involved in the pathogenesis
of stroke and whether MB interrupts this
process remain unclear.
Using a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke, we have
demonstrated that mitophagy is induced
in the early stage of stroke but is inhibited
shortly thereafter (data not shown). In this
study, we showed that 24 h of ischemia
suppressed mitophagic activity but that
MB treatment rescued it. We confirmed
this effect of MB using an oxygen-glucose
deprivation (OGD) model in vitro and
identified that the protection conferred by
MB during OGD was abolished due to the
inhibition of mitophagy. As mitophagy is
directly induced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
(27,31–33), we further explored whether
the effect of MB on mitophagy was mediated by the regulation of MMP. We found
that the MMP dramatically declined after
cells were exposed to OGD, whereas MB
attenuated this decline. Moreover, we verified that the relatively high MMP maintained by MB during OGD contributed to
the activation of mitophagy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion and
Methylene Blue Treatment
Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were
purchased from Vital River Laboratories
(Beijing, China). Focal ischemia was induced via right MCAO as described pre-

viously (34). Briefly, focal cerebral ischemia was induced by inserting a 4-0 nylon
monofilament through the right internal
carotid artery. Different doses (1, 5 or
10 mg/kg) of MB or vehicle (normal
saline) were intraperitoneally (IP) injected immediately after occlusion. The
animal protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Academy of Military Medical Science, and all measures were taken
to reduce animal numbers and suffering.
Neurological Deficit Score
Assessment
Total neurological deficit score. This
test, which consisted of two sections, was
conducted at 24 h after MCAO with or
without MB treatment: (1) the postural reflex test was performed to evaluate upper
body posture while the rat was suspended by the tail, and (2) the forelimb
placing test was performed to examine
sensor motor integration in forelimb placing responses to visual, tactile and proprioceptive stimuli. The total neurological
deficit score was graded on a scale from 0
(normal score) to 12 (maximal score) (35).
Grid-walking test. Each animal was
placed individually on a grid with an
area of 110 × 10 × 100 cm (length ×
width × height) containing 9-cm2 wire
mesh and were allowed to freely walk
for 5 min. During this 5-min period, the
total number of foot faults by the ipsilateral forelimb was counted. If the rat was
resting with the grid at the level of the
wrist, this positioning was also considered as a fault. If the rat was not able to
step for 5 min, the maximal score of 15
was assigned (36).
Infarct Volume Analysis
The rats were anesthetized and euthanized 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24 h after MCAO. The
brains were rapidly removed and were
placed in a rat mold to generate 2-mm
coronal sections. The sections were stained
with 1% (w/v) 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) solution at room temperature for 30 min and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The infarct size was measured and analyzed using ImageJ

software. To compensate for the effect of
brain edema, the corrected infarct volume was calculated as described previously: corrected infarct area = left hemisphere area – (right hemisphere area –
infarct area) (37).
Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining
The brain tissues from the rats were
embedded in paraffin and 6-μm-thick serial coronal sections were generated and
mounted on slides. The sections were
stained using hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) according to a previously described standard protocol (38).
Transmission Electron Microscopic
Examination
The tissue samples were handled as reported previously (39). Briefly, brain section was quickly cut into 1 mm cubes, immersion-fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde
in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)
overnight at 4°C and fixed in 1% buffered
osmium tetroxide. Specimens were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series
and embedded in epoxy resin. For mitochondrial structure analysis, we used a
grading system to perform a quantitative
evaluation. The mitochondria scoring parameters were as follows (40):
0: Normal mitochondrion.
1: Normal mitochondrion but lacking
granular deposits.
2: Loss of matrix granules and clarification of the matrix without disruption
of cristae.
3: Loss of matrix granules, uniform clarification of the matrix and disruption of
cristae.
4: Loss of matrix granules, uniform disruption of cristae, and loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity.
The samples were visualized and photographed using a transmission electron
microscope (TEM) at 80 kV.
FJB and TUNEL Labeling
Cell necrosis was determined via
Fluoro-Jade B (FJB; Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) labeling and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated bi-

otinylated UTP nick-end labeling
(TUNEL). At 24 h after MCAO, the rats
were anesthetized and transcardially
perfused with saline followed by cold
4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution.
The brains were rapidly removed and
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose. FJB and
TUNEL labeling were performed using
in situ death detection kits as described
previously (41). Fluorescence signals
were visualized via fluorescence microscopy.
Cell Culture and Oxygen-Glucose
Deprivation
A hypoxia-sensitive neuron-like PC12
cell line was used to simulate cerebral ischemia in an OGD model. The cells were
cultured at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and
100 mg/mL streptomycin in 5% CO2. For
OGD, the cultures were placed in a hypoxic incubator containing 0.3% O2 and a
gas mixture of 95% N2/5% CO2, and the
medium was replaced with glucose-free
RPMI 1640 medium for 2 h. For treatment, MB (0.5 μmol/L) dissolved in PBS
(phosphate buffered saline) or an inhibitor (3-MA, 2 mmol/L; carbonyl
cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone
(CCCP), 1 μmol/L) was added to the culture medium immediately when the cells
were exposed to OGD.
Western Blot
Brain sections that included the ischemic area and corresponding regions from
the contralateral hemisphere or cells
were collected, and protein extracts were
prepared as described previously (34).
The primary antibodies used for Western
blot–targeted receptor-interacting protein
1 or 3 (RIP1/RIP3), microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondrion (Tom20), Beclin1, P62 or β-actin.
The signals were detected with the use of
an ECL Western blot substrate (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA,
USA). Quantitative analyses were performed using the ImageJ software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD, USA).

ROS Detection
The intracellular ROS levels were measured using the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe CM-H2DCFDA after OGD.
The cells were incubated in 10 μmol/L
CM-H2DCFDA in the dark at 37°C for 30
min and then washed with PBS. The suspended cells were analyzed via flow cytometry.
Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
Assessment
The MMP was determined by using
the fluorescent probe JC-1 two hours
after OGD in PC12 cells according to the
manufacturer’s directions. The ratio of
red:green fluorescence of JC-1 is dependent on the MMP. After treatment, the
cells were incubated in 2.5 μmol/L JC-1
for 20 min at 37°C and then rinsed twice
with PBS. Afterward, the cells were collected and analyzed via flow cytometry
(42).
Statistical Analyses
The data are presented as the means ±
SE. Differences between the control and
experimental groups were examined via
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Values of P <0.05 were considered to be
significant. At least three independent
experiments were performed for each
experiment.

RESULTS
MB Attenuates the Infarct Volume and
Improves Neurological Functions
To assess the effects of MB on ACI injury, SD rats were subjected to MCAO
for 24 h. We found that ischemia caused
massive cerebral infarction in the vehicle control (VC) group; all three doses of
MB reduced the infarct volume and,
among these doses, the medium dose of
MB displayed the most significant effect, an approximate 50% reduction in
the infarct volume (Figures 1A–B). Decreased brain damage in the MB-treated
rats was accompanied by reduced neu-

rological deficit scores. The animals
treated with the medium dose of MB
showed attenuated injury in the impaired limb on the forelimb placing test
(Figure 1C). On the grid-walking test, a
clear increase in forepaw foot faults was
observed at 24 h after stroke. The animals treated with the medium or high
dose of MB showed a significant reduction in forepaw foot faults after stroke
(Figure 1D). These data showed that MB
treatment reduced the infarct volume
and improved neurological functions
after ACI injury.
MB Alleviates the Destruction of Brain
Tissue Morphology
The morphological changes in brain
tissue were detected via H&E staining at
24 h after stroke. As shown in Figure 2A,
cell swelling and nuclear pyknosis were
detected in the VC group; in contrast, all
three doses of MB improved the histological appearance. The statistical data
showed that the percentage of swelling
cells was significantly reduced by MB
compared with the VC (Figure 2B). The
results provide further evidence that MB
greatly prevented cell swelling and brain
tissue destruction. Necrosis and apoptosis are the principal mechanisms of ischemic injury (43). Whether these morphological alterations are determined by
the degree of necrosis or apoptosis and
what role MB plays in the process both
need to be clarified.
MB Decreases Necrosis Rather than
Apoptosis
Using FJB and TUNEL double-fluorescence staining, we analyzed necrosis and
apoptosis at 24 h after stroke. TUNEL labeling represents apoptotic cells, and FJB
labeling represents degenerating cells, including apoptotic and necrotic cells (41).
We observed that MB did not decrease
apoptosis, but actually increased it (see
Supplemental Figure 1); however, the
percentage of necrotic cells, as determined by FJB labeling, excluding the
TUNEL-positive cells, was significantly
less in the MB treatment group than in
the VC group (Figures 3A–C). At the

RESEARCH ARTICLE

same time, we noticed that in this ischemia condition necrosis is the dominant
cause of ischemic injury.
RIP1 and RIP3 are the key signaling
molecules in programmed necrosis
(44,45). To verify the effects of MB on
necrosis, we measured the protein levels
of RIP1 and RIP3 via Western blot.
Compared to the contralateral (uninjured) side, ischemia (in the affected
side) caused an elevation in the expression of both RIP1 and RIP3; however,
MB suppressed this elevation of RIP1
and RIP3 expression (Figures 3D–F),
suggesting a protective effect of MB
against necrosis.

number of cells) × 100. MB obviously decreased the swelling cells caused by acute ischemia. n = 10; **P < 0.01 compared with the VC. Scale bar, 50 μm.

MB Improves the Structure of
Mitochondria
The mitochondrion is a crucial target of
MB. Whether the MB-mediated protection against ACI injury involves the regulation of mitochondria is unclear. Based
on TEM, we found that the mitochondrial
structures in the cortical neurons were severely damaged 24 h after stroke; the
cristae were disrupted and disordered,
the matrix granules were lost, and the mitochondria were vacuolated. All three
doses of MB ameliorated the destruction
of mitochondria (Figure 4A). The mitochondrial structure scoring data showed
that the medium dose of MB exerted the
most apparent effect (Figure 4B). The
structure of mitochondria depends on the
regulation of mitochondrial function. Mitophagy has an important function in
clearance of the damaged mitochondria.
Whether mitophagy is suppressed after
stroke and whether MB is conductive to
the induction of mitophagy need to be
elucidated.
MB Increases the Induction of
Mitophagy
The expression of Beclin-1, LC3, p62
and Tom20, which are molecular markers of mitophagy, was detected via
Western blot. In the ipsilateral side of
the VC group, the expression of Beclin-1
(representing the initiation of autophagy) and the flux of LC3 from I to II
(suggesting the activation of autophagy)

were reduced. p62 (an adaptor protein
responsible for facilitating the binding
of autophagic substrates to the autophagosome) and Tom20 (a mitochondrial outer membrane protein indicating
the amount of mitochondria) were accumulated in the injured side compared
with the contralateral side. Collectively,
these results demonstrated that mitophagy was suppressed 24 h after

stroke. However, MB augmented mitophagy in both hemispheres, especially
in the ipsilateral hemisphere, compared
with the VC based on the increases in
Beclin-1 expression and LC3 flux and
the decreases in the p62 and Tom20 levels (Figures 5A, B). Based on TEM, the
typical morphological characteristic of
mitophagy, the encapsulation of a mitochondrion by the double membrane of

424 | DI ET AL. | MOL MED 21:420-429, 2015

the autophagosome, was observed in
the cortical neurons in the MB group,
whereas a lack of mitophagy was observed in the VC group (Figure 5C). The
mitochondrial ultrastructure further validated the mitophagy in the MB group.
These results suggested that the augment of mitophagy by MB may contribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial quality following stroke.

RESEARCH ARTICLE

MMP (Supplementary Figure 2). After
OGD treatment, mitophagy was inhibited, and MB augmented mitophagy as
shown in Figure 5A; however, when the
MMP was further reduced due to the
addition of CCCP, the augmentation of
mitophagy by MB was suppressed (Figure 7C). These results revealed that sustaining the MMP at a higher level using
MB under OGD conditions contributed
to the induction of mitophagy.

Mitophagy Mediates the Protection of
MB against Acute Ischemic Injury
To confirm whether mitophagy mediates the protective effect of MB against
ACI injury, we first measured the effect
of MB on mitophagy in an OGD model
to simulate ACI injury in vitro. Figure 6A
clearly displayed that after 2 h of OGD,
MB promoted mitophagy as demonstrated by increased Beclin-1 expression
and LC3 flux and decreased P62 and
Tom20 levels. The statistical data show
that 2 h of OGD induced mitophagy and
MB dramatically enhanced the mitophagy under OGD (Figure 6B). Subsequently, we tested whether the protective
effect of MB against ACI injury was altered after mitophagy was inhibited.
Given that ROS are recognized as central
mediators of neuroinflammation and cytotoxicity caused by ischemia and that
mitophagy blocks the generation of ROS
(24,46), we examined the ROS levels after
mitophagy was inhibited. We found that
OGD caused an elevation of ROS and that
MB suppressed this elevation of ROS. As
expected, when mitophagy was inhibited
using 3-MA, an inhibitor of autophagy,
the suppression of ROS accumulation by
MB was abolished (Figures 6C, D). These

results demonstrated that MB augmented the activity of mitophagy under
OGD conditions, thereby mediating the
reduction in the ROS levels.
The MB-Induced Elevation of MMP
Contributes to the Activation of
Mitophagy
How did MB augment mitophagy in
the case of ACI injury? Because mitophagy is directly induced by the loss of
MMP (33,47), and because the reduction
in MMP can be attenuated by MB (47),
we analyzed the MMP via flow cytometry and measured mitophagy via Western blot in the OGD model. The MMP
sharply fell after the cells were exposed
to OGD for 2 h and MB significantly attenuated this decline, even though MB in
the absence of OGD induced a decrease
in the MMP (Figures 7A–B). To explore
whether the elevation of MMP by MB
under OGD conditions mediates the induction of mitophagy, we detected the
change of mitophagy after the reduction
in the MMP during OGD was further exacerbated via the addition of CCCP, a
mitochondria-depolarizing agent. CCCP
induced a sharp drop in the MMP, and
MB greatly attenuated the decline in the

DISCUSSION
Stroke is the fourth leading disease
that threatens human life and health (48).
Acute cerebral ischemia is the primary
cause of stroke. At present, there is a lack
of effective drugs for the treatment of
ACI injury. Another issue is that fewer
than 5% of stroke patients can obtain
thrombolytic therapy within the therapeutic window. Therefore, seeking effective neuroprotective drugs is an immediate focus. MB is a lipophilic compound
that has been used for the treatment of
multiple disorders, including methemoglobinemia, malaria and cyanide poisoning (9,10,49). Recently, MB has been
shown to play neuroprotective roles in a
variety of mitochondria-associated cytotoxicity paradigms, such as stroke,
Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease,
Huntington’s disease and optic neuropathy (30,47). In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that MB attenuates ACI injury by increasing the
induction of mitophagy.
We have identified that MB reduces
the infarct volume and the neurological
dysfunction caused by ACI injury. To investigate the impact of MB on brain tissue structure after stroke, we observed
the changes in cell morphology. Cell
swelling and nuclear pyknosis were reduced due to MB treatment. Based on
further analysis of apoptosis and necrosis, we determined the role of MB in
ameliorating necrosis. We were also surprised to find that MB did not decrease
but rather increased apoptosis. The reason for this increase in apoptosis appears
to be related to its reduction of necrosis,
representing a compromise mechanism

that avoids additional necrosis in stroke.
The expression of key signaling molecules in programmed necrosis, RIP1 and
RIP3 was decreased significantly by MB,
suggesting the suppression of necrotic
activity. Collectively, these results supported that hindering the necrotic process contributes to the protective effect of
MB against ACI injury.
To identify the potential mechanism by
which MB inhibited necrosis, we focused
on the effect of MB on mitochondrial
structure and function after stroke, considering that the mitochondrion is an important target of MB (50). The observa-

tion and scoring of the mitochondrial ultrastructure indicated that the mitochondrial structure was seriously disrupted
after stroke, but that MB dramatically
ameliorated the disintegration of the mitochondrial structure. This result inspired us to explore whether mitochondrial function was also improved by MB
in stroke. Mitophagy functions as selective clearance of damaged mitochondria
to reduce necrosis or apoptosis and to
sustain cellular activity (31,51). Therefore, mitophagy is considered as a protective response to a variety of stresses.
At 24 h after ACI, mitophagy was sup-

426 | DI ET AL. | MOL MED 21:420-429, 2015

pressed to a large extent. However, to
our excitement, mitophagy was clearly
augmented by MB treatment compared
with the VC treatment. Thus, the augmentation of mitophagy may at least
partially explain the maintenance of the
mitochondrial structure by MB in stroke.
To further verify whether mitophagy mediated the protective effect of MB against
ACI injury, we examined the ROS levels
in an OGD model in vitro. We found that
OGD caused a dramatic elevation of
ROS, MB greatly suppressed this elevation, and the suppression of MB was
abolished after mitophagy was inhibited,
demonstrating that mitophagy mediates
the protective effect of MB against ACI
injury.
MMP is an electrostatic potential generated by the proton gradient across the
mitochondrial inner membrane that is
driven by the enzymes of electron transport chain (ETC). The MMP is an indicator of the mitochondrial functional status, and deregulation of MMP leads to a
large spectrum of major human diseases,
including diabetes, neurodegeneration,
cancer and others (52). It has been reported that MB maintains the MMP
when mitochondria are dysfunctional (2),
and the MMP is a regulator of mitophagy (27). Accordingly, we investigated the effect of MB on the MMP and
the relationship between the MMP and
the induction of mitophagy. We discovered that the dramatic decline in the
MMP under OGD conditions was greatly
hindered by MB, and unexpectedly, MB
in the absence of OGD induced a decrease in the MMP. Based on MB’s redox
properties that low MB concentrations
favor dimerization and reduction,
whereas high concentrations promote oxidation (7), we propose the following hypothesis for this phenomenon: in functional mitochondria, MB in its reduced
form donates H+ (47), which tends to
cause an elevation of MMP; MB in its oxidized form accepts H+ (53), which tends
to cause a decline of MMP. However, in
dysfunctional mitochondria, these effects
may be just opposite. When the activities
of ETC enzymes are decreased, MMP

RESEARCH ARTICLE

drops rapidly and excessive H+ in the
mitochondrial matrix provided by MB in
its reduced form cannot be pumped out
into the mitochondrial intermembrane
space, which aggravates the drop of
MMP; in contrast, MB in its oxidized
form can accept the H+ that cannot be
pumped out due to the decreased activities of ETC enzymes, which hinders the
further drop of MMP. It thus seems that
0.5 μmol/L MB we used in this study
displayed its oxidation properties. That
is, it decreased the MMP in the normal
conditions and attenuated the drop of
MMP in the OGD conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the augment
of mitophagy by MB was completely
abolished due to the addition of CCCP.
These results suggested that the maintenance of MMP by MB in stroke promoted the induction of mitophagy.

CONCLUSION
In summary, our study demonstrated
that the suppression of mitophagy is involved in the pathogenesis of stroke.
More importantly, we confirmed that the
augmentation of mitophagy by MB mediates the protection against ACI injury.
Thus, we propose that MB is a promising
neuroprotective agent against acute ischemic stroke.

Figure 7. The MB-mediated elevation of the MMP under OGD conditions contributes to the activation of mitophagy. (A) MB (0.5 μmol/L)
alleviates the decline in the MMP during OGD based on flow cytometric analysis. (B) Quantification of the MMP. n = 4; **P < 0.01 compared with the NC, ##P < 0.01 compared with OGD. (C) Western blot analysis of mitophagy. β-actin was used as the internal control. Exacerbating the decline in the MMP with CCCP (1 μmol/L) abolishes the induction of mitophagy by MB.
