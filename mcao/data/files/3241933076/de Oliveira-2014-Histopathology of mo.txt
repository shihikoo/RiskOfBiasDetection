Experimental ischemia results in cortical brain lesion followed by ischemic stroke. In this study, focal
cerebral ischemia was induced in mice by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. We studied cortical
layers I, II/III, V and VI in the caudal forelimb area (CFA) and medial agranular cortex (AGm) from control
and C57BL/6 mice induced with ischemic stroke. Based on our analysis of CFA and AGm motor cortex,
signiﬁcant differences were observed in the numbers of neurons, astrocytes and microglia in the
superﬁcial II/III and deep V cortical layers. Cellular changes were more prominent in layer V of the CFA
with nuclear pyknosis, chromatin fragmentation, necrosis and degeneration, as well as, morphological
evidence of apoptosis, mainly in neurons. As result, the CFA was more severely impaired than the AGm in
this focal cerebral ischemic model, as evidenced by the proliferation of astrocytes, potentially resulting
in neuroinﬂammation by microglia-like cells.

1. Introduction
Cerebral stroke is one of the main causes of death and acquired
disabilities worldwide and represents 87% of cerebrovascular
diseases (Arsene et al., 2011). Ischemic stroke accounts for
approximately 80% of all strokes and results from a thrombotic
or embolic occlusion of a major cerebral artery, most often the
middle cerebral artery (MCA) or its branches. Ischemic stroke has
high disability potential and can affect the motor cortex, generally
leading to impaired motor control and sensitivity in the limbs, face
and cognition. The therapeutic option for acute stroke is
thrombolysis, which is limited by a narrow time window and
numerous contraindications (Biernaskie and Corbett, 2001; Ding
and Fisher, 2002; Wang et al., 2001; Winstein et al., 1999). Glial
cells are essential in regulating brain function in healthy or
pathological conditions. Brain insult affects astrocytes and

potentially interferes with their many key functions, including
maintenance of the blood–brain barrier and vasomodulation (Chen
and Swanson, 2003). Moreover, astroglial reaction is essential in
limiting the areas of brain damage, as well as supporting the
remodeling of neural circuitry (Chvátal et al., 2008; Mărgăritescu
et al., 2009; Pekny and Nilsson, 2005).
Experimental focal cerebral ischemia models have been
developed to simulate human stroke and serve as a valuable tool
in research. In an experimental stroke model, researchers may
address speciﬁc questions about pathologic events occurring after
ischemic stroke. During ischemic stroke, the caudal forelimb area
(CFA – considered analogous to primate primary motor cortex) as
well as medial agranular cortex (AGm – considered analogous to a
primate premotor cortex) are the cortical structures most affected
in mice and other mammals, suggesting the importance of
establishing reliable models to understand the pathophysiology
and histopathology of brain ischemia (Tennant et al., 2011; Zeiler
et al., 2013). Motor movements can be evoked over a large area of
frontal cortex, speciﬁcally in the lateral agranular cortex (AGl) and
AGm. The forelimb area of the rat motor cortex is organized as a
large CFA and a smaller rostral forelimb area (RFA), each with
corticospinal projection neurons (Neafsey and Sievert, 1982).

Studying a mouse model, Zeiler et al. (2013) concluded that the
AGm could reorganize after a focal motor stroke and thus serve as a
new control area for prehension of the AGm.
The aim of our study was to characterize the morphological
changes in CFA and AGm motor cortex parenchyma after focal
ischemic stroke in C57BL/6 adult mice. We investigated the cellular
arrangement of neurons and glial cells, as well as the extent of
apoptosis in mice submitted to experimental ischemic stroke.
Forty-eight hours after brain injury in mice, we observed that the
number of pyknotic nuclei was increased and that neuronal
shrinkage was greater in the cortical deep (V) layer in comparison
to the cortical superﬁcial (II/III) layers, suggesting that the extent of
injury was more prominent in deeper cortical layers.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental design for ischemia
MCA occlusion was performed according to a modiﬁed protocol (Kuraoka et al.,
2009). Brieﬂy, 8- to 10-week-old C57/BL6 mice were anesthetized using an
intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). After
anesthesia, with the help of a magnifying glass (SZ2-LGB, Olympus), an incision was
made in the skin, which was detached to expose the temporal is muscle for
resection at the insertion of the temporal and zygomatic bone, allowing access to
the temporal fossa. The temporal bone was thinned with the help of a micromotor
(LB100, Beltec) in order to locate the distal portion of the left MCA, and occlusion by
electrocauterization was made with an electronic scalpel (BE 3000, KVN). Fortyeight hours post-surgery, all animals were anesthetized again for intracardiac
perfusion with physiological saline solution, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
solution in 0.1 ml of phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. The brains were then removed and
ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma1) for 48 h for histological testing. All
experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the
Colégio Brasileiro de Experimentação Animal (COBEA) and were approved by the
Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina Animal Care Committee. The work has
been carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical
Association.
Animals were divided into the following experimental groups: Group 1 (control
n = 6), including mice without cerebral artery occlusion, and Group 2 (ischemic,
n = 6), including mice induced with focal cerebral ischemia in the left cerebral
hemisphere.
2.2. Histology
After embedding in parafﬁn blocks, the brains were sectioned into coronal
sections 5 mm in thickness, using a Leica RM 2025 microtome. These sections were
oriented from the frontal lobe to the parietal lobe. They were then washed,
immersed in a thermostatic bath at 45 8C, and mounted on gelatinized slides.
The samples of cerebral cortex were deparafﬁnized, hydrated, submitted to Nissl
staining, rinsed, dehydrated and ﬁnally mounted on Entelan (Merck1) for
identiﬁcation of normal and ischemic cells. The histological preparations were
photographed under a light microscope (Olympus, BX 41) with a digital image
capture system (OLYMPUS Q-Color3TM IMAGING SYSTEM). At least 15 sections from
each animal were examined.
2.3. Motor cortex area and cell quantiﬁcation
Coronal histological sections of the left brain hemisphere were analyzed under
light microscopy and compared with the equivalent coronal sections established in

the Mouse Brain Atlas (Paxinos and Franklin, 2008). Digital images of Nissl stained
coronal sections were captured at a magniﬁcation of 4 using a light microscope
Olympus BX41 to identify the CFA and AGm areas of motor cortex. We used the
corpus callosum and lateral ventricle as reference to locate the motor area. The area
was situated at the anterior – posterior position of the coronal plane determined
within 0.62 to 1.10 mm in relation to the bregma suture. We situated the cortical
layers to each slice of the left-brain hemisphere in a gradual to the following
magniﬁcation 10, 40, and 100. Analyses were performed by morphological
identiﬁcation of nuclei obtained by Nissl staining (Fig. 1A and B) in the superﬁcial
and deep cortical layers from both AGm and CFA areas (Müller et al., 2004; Tennant
et al., 2011; Zeiler et al., 2013). We concentrated the morphological analysis in the
layers II/III and V since they had more structural alterations. We evaluated the
cytoarchitecture motor cortex in four different microscopic ﬁelds obtaining each
image at 40 and 100: superﬁcial (II/III) and deep (V) cortical layers of the AGm
(from 0 to 1 mm from bregma) and the CFA (from 1 to 2 mm from bregma) for
control and ischemic group. Normal neurons, ischemic neurons, astrocytes and
microglia-like cells were quantiﬁed, considering an experimental area of
140  105 mm2 and magniﬁcation of 100. The cells bordering the upper edge
and right edge of the experimental area were not counted (Gundersen, 1977). Five
slides were analyzed and photographed for each animal group (control n = 6 and
ischemic n = 6).
2.4. Immunohistochemistry
Sections from the cerebral cortex were then deparafﬁnized at 45 8C, treated with
xylene and alcohol, and then rinsed with phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Antigenic
recovery was made with 0.01 M citrate buffer for 40 min (pH 6.0). Nonspeciﬁc
antigenic sites were blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The sections were
incubated overnight at 4 8C with caspase-3 rabbit polyclonal primary antibody
(1:50, Abcam 13847). Sections were washed with PBS Tween 20, followed by
incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody streptavidin peroxidase, conjugated (Sigma) for 40 min. Sections were washed and incubated with 3,30 diaminobenzidine (DAB) as chromogen (Sigma), and ﬁnally the sections were
counterstained with a hematoxylin solution.
For immunoﬂuorescence analysis, the cerebral cortex sections were prepared as
described above. We utilized identical methodology to locate the cortical motor
areas as mentioned above. Nonspeciﬁc antigenic sites were blocked with 10% FBS.
Samples were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein
(GFAP) primary antibody (1:50, overnight incubation, Cell Signaling, 3670) and
Neuronal nuclei (NeuN) primary antibody (1:100, Millipore, overnight incubation,
MAB 377). Sections were washed with PBS Tween 20 and incubated with AlexaFluor
488 immunoglobulin (IgG, GFAP) or Alexa Fluor 594 immunoglobulin (IgG, NeuN)
secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for 2 h in the dark. Nuclear staining with 40 ,6diamino-2-phenylindoledihydrochloride (DAPI) (Sigma) was performed. We made
a previous standardization of the primary and secondary antibodies during the
experiments we did not alter the batch of antibodies avoid changes in ﬂuorescence.
Fluorescent examinations were performed with a microscope (Olympus, BX 41),
using appropriate ﬁlter sets. Images were captured with an OLYMPUS Q-Color3TM
IMAGING SYSTEM. During ﬂuorescence evaluation, all slides were pre-exposed for
0.5 min to light before shutter of camera starts in a dark room. The camera operates
always at the same parameters during shutting and always at the same temperature
(20 8C) that minimizes thermal noise during long exposure times yielding high
quality, low light images.
2.5. Statistical analysis
Data were reported as mean  SD. The nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test was
applied to assess the occurrence of signiﬁcant differences between control and
ischemic groups. The median and quartiles were the representative measures of these
samples. P values <0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results
Based on histomorphological analysis of Nissl-stained samples
from the AGm and CFA, we were able to identify neurons,
astrocytes and microglia-like cells. We characterized pyramidal
neurons by the triangular cell body (Fig. 2A and B) and
nonpyramidal neurons by the round nuclei with one, two or three
nucleoli (Fig. 2C and D) (Garcia et al., 1993; Garman, 2011; Müller
et al., 2004). Astrocytes were recognized by the spherical nucleus
and the heterogeneous arrangement of chromatin (Fig. 2D), while

3

microglia-like cells (Fig. 2D) were recognized by the elongated and
tapered nucleus, quite distinct from the neurons and astrocytes
(Arango-Davila et al., 2004; Garman, 2011; Gürer et al., 2009;
Mărgăritescu et al., 2009; Marks et al., 2001). The superﬁcial II/III
cortical layers of the AGm suggested the predominance of
pyramidal neurons with normal morphology (Fig. 2A) and rare
astrocytes. The deep cortical layer (V)of the AGm indicated
pyramidal and round neurons (Fig. 2B), but few astrocytes. The
primary motor area (CFA) in both superﬁcial II/III layers and deep V
layer of the control group suggested the predominance of

nonpyramidal (round) neurons with normal morphology (Fig. 2C
and D) and astrocytes. No pathologic alterations were observed in
the superﬁcial II/II or deep V layers of either AGmor CFA (Fig. 2A–D)
of the control group.
We veriﬁed the extent of ischemic lesion in the frontal-parietal
cortex, identifying the neurons with normal and altered morphology. We evaluated the number of cells with nuclear shrinkage,
pyknosis, and chromatin alteration, which were characterized as
ischemic neurons (Arsava et al., 2009; Back et al., 2004; Garcia
et al., 1997; Garman, 2011; Gürer et al., 2009; Kuraoka et al., 2009;
Müller et al., 2004; Tamura et al., 1980; Zeng and Xu, 2000).
In the ischemic group, the brain tissue revealed neurons with
altered nuclear morphology, as well as moderate to pronounced
nuclear shrinkage (Fig. 2E and G), and some cells showed strong
cytoplasmic basophilia (Fig. 2H). Many neurons revealed nuclear
pyknosis, chromatin fragmentation and degeneration (Fig. 2G and
H), mainly in the CFA deep V layer of the cortex, indicating necrosis.
Such necrotic cells are characterized as ischemic neurons. In
superﬁcial layers II/III of AGm and CFA, fewer neurons showed
pathologic morphology among normal neurons (Fig. 2E and G). In
the central infarct area of deep V layers of both AGm and CFA, a
signiﬁcant number of neurons showed nuclear shrinkage, pyknosis, chromatin alteration and evident cell swelling (Fig. 2F and H).
To assess the number of neurons in different cortical layers
(Fig. 3A), the quantitative analysis revealed more normal neurons
with regular nuclear morphology and homogeneous staining in the
AGm II/III layers (U = 10.674), AGm V layer (U = 9.000), CFA II/III
layers (U = 19.500) and CFA V layer (U = 0.500) in the control group
when compared to the ischemic group. In the ischemic group,
fewer cells exhibited regular morphology in the CFA motor area
when compared to the AGm area. The number of ischemic neurons

was predominant in both AGm and CFA II/III and V layers. Notably,
the number of ischemic neurons was greater in the V layers of both
AGm and CFA deep motor areas (Fig. 3B).
The quantitative analysis suggested that the number of
astrocytes was signiﬁcantly higher in the ischemic group than
in the control group: AGm II/III layers (U = 52.500), AGm V layer
(U = 108.000), CFA II/III layers (U = 37.500) and CFA V layer
(U = 9.500) (Fig. 3C). Remarkably, the number of astrocytes was
higher in the CFA and AGm V layers than either the CFA or AGm II/
III layers of the motor areas in the ischemic group. We also
observed differences in the distribution of microglia-like cells in
the ischemic brain (Fig. 3D). In contrast to the control group, a
higher amount of microglia-like cells was found in the AGm II/III
layers (U = 206.500), AGm V layer (U = 73.500), CFA II/III layers
(U = 36.000) and CFA V layer (U = 45.000) in the ischemic group.
The AGm CFA V layer of the ischemic group revealed a greater
number of microglia-like cells than observed in the AGm or CFA II/
III layers of the motor areas. The control group showed an
equivalent number of microglia-like cells in all motor areas, both
AGm and CFA.
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis revealed changes in NeuN
reactivity in the control group when compared to the ischemic
group in the CFA/AGm motor areas. In the superﬁcial II/III AGm
cortical layer, NeuN were predominant in the control group (96% of
cells), while in the ischemic group, the NeuN positive cells
decreased to 60%. In the deep V layer of AGm, the number of NeuNpositive cells was 60% in control group, while in ischemic group,
this number dropped to30% (Fig. 4A). In CFA layers II/III, we
detected NeuN-positive cells in the control group at 62%, and an
equivalent number of cells was observed in the ischemic group
(60%). In layer V of CFA, the number of NeuN-positive cells in the

control group was 66%, while a drop to 40% was observed in the
ischemic group (Fig. 4B). In the superﬁcial II/III layers, we noted
differences in the number of DAPI-positive cells distributed in AGm
and CFA (95 and 143 cells/ﬁeld, respectively). In the deep V layer of
both AGm and CFA, we observed an equivalent number of DAPIpositive cells (140 and 148 cells/ﬁeld, respectively).
No GFAP immunoreactivity for astrocytes was observed in the
control group (Fig. 5A and B). However, the ischemic group showed
different degrees of reaction with anti-GFAP antibody. A slight
increase inGFAP-positive cells was noted in the AGm II/III (11%)
and V (6%) layers in the ischemic group (Fig. 5A). In the ischemic
group, the number of GFAP-positive cells was negligible (12%) in
layer II/III of the CFA motor cortex, but in the deeper V layer, this
number increased to 53%, followed by numerous astrocytes with
large nuclei and multiple branches (Fig. 5B).
Caspase-3 expression was evaluated in sections from control
and ischemic brain (Fig. 6). The immunoreactivity was positive for
ischemic neurons of the AGm V layer, as well as CFA II/III and V
layers of motor cortex. The negative control group showed no
immunoreactivity in either the AGm or CFA I/III and V layers
(Fig. 6E–H). Sections from all ischemic groups demonstrated
immunoreactivity. In the AGm I/III layers, we noted only a few
neurons stained with anti-caspase-3 (Fig. 6M) when compared to

the AGm V layer with a greater degree of staining (Fig. 6N).
Neurons stained with caspase-3 were seen in the CFA II/III layers,
but they were more numerous in the CFA V layer (Fig. 6O and P).
The detection of activated caspase-3 in the AGm I/III layers was
rare, but more caspase-3-positive neurons were found in the AGm
deep V layer of the motor area, as well as the II/III and V layers of
the CFA cortical motor area.
4. Discussion
Clinical variability of stroke often complicates research because
a large patient cohort is required to avoid confounding effects.
Experimental focal cerebral ischemia models have been developed
to mimic human stroke and provide a valuable tool in stroke
research. In an experimental rodent stroke model, variables are
easier to control, and researchers can address speciﬁc questions
about pathogenic events occurring post-ischemic stroke and how
to develop novel therapeutic strategies.
Intraarterial occlusion of the MCA is the most common focal
stroke model in mouse. Thromboembolic stroke models mimic
human stroke more closely than other models of cerebral ischemia
since most human strokes are caused by thromboembolism
(Durukan and Tatlisumak, 2007). Photothrombotic stroke models

8

J.L. Oliveira et al. / Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy 57–58 (2014) 1–9

use local intravascular photooxidation to generate highly circumscribed ischemic cortical lesions (Carmichael, 2005). Photothrombosis induces a cortical infarct by the systemic injection of a
photoactive dye (most often Rose Bengal) in combination with
irradiation by a light beam at a speciﬁc wavelength (Watson et al.,
1985). The region of irradiation can be determined in order to
induce ischemic lesion in any desired cortical area. The advantages
of this model are the small size of infarcts, ability to place the
infarct within distinct functional subdivisions of cortex, and
minimal surgical manipulation of the animal. The disadvantages of
this model stem from the microvascular insult. There is relatively
little ischemic penumbra, or region of local collateral ﬂow and
reperfusion, as seen in vessel occlusion models.The different
models of stroke, which range from proximal to distal MCA
occlusion to embolic and photothrombotic stroke, vary widely in
their ability to model human disease and their application to the
study of cell death, inﬂammation and neural repair (Bacigaluppi
et al., 2010). Overall, rodent stroke models provide the experimental backbone for translational research.
Using Nissl histomorphological staining, we qualitatively
analyzed the cytoarchitecture of the superﬁcial layers (II/III) and
deep layer (V) of the AGm and CFA motor cortex from C57BL/6 mice
induced with experimental focal ischemic stroke. In the control
group, our results showed that the AGm superﬁcial II/III layers
were characterized by the predominance of pyramidal neurons,
while in the AGm deep V layer, neurons showed a pyramidal and
rounded aspect. In CFA II/III layers, rare astrocytes were present,
when compared to the deep V layer, while microglia-like cells were
scarce. In the CFA, the superﬁcial primary motor and deep areas
showed a predominance of rounded neurons.
Histopathological analysis of the cortex from the ischemic
group exhibited morphological differences when compared to the
control group. Forty-eight hours post-focal ischemia, we found
neuronal nuclei with ischemic alterations, as characterized by
shrinkage and pyknosis (Arsava et al., 2009; Garcia et al., 1993) in
the superﬁcial and deep cortical layers of both AGm and CFA
cortical motor areas. Moreover, in the CFA deep cortical V layer, we
observed structural alteration of chromatin, karyolysis, basophilic
cytoplasm, and cell degeneration by neural necrosis (Arsava et al.,
2009). Compared to the II/III layers, more cells showed morphological changes by ischemic insult and necrosis in this layer (Arsava
et al., 2009; Auer, 2001; Dias et al., 2000; Garman, 2011; Müller
et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2009; Zeng and Xu, 2000).
The quantitative analysis of viable neurons indicated signiﬁcant
differences in the distribution of these cells in different layers of
cortex in the ischemic animals. These cells were predominant in
both AGm and CFA I/III and V cortical layers in the control group. In
the ischemic group, they were distributed in the same areas, but in
lower numbers, particularly in the deep layers of cortex. This was
followed by the increased number of astrocytes inlayers II/III and V
of the AGm and layers II/III of the CFA, although the number of
astrocytes was particularly higher in layer V of the CFA motor area.
This ﬁnding suggests that astrogliosis, as the response to the
ischemic insult, occurs at the deeper layers of cortex and may
contribute to the progress of ischemia, thus affecting brain
recovery and neuron plasticity by the secretion of neurotrophic
factors (Chvátal et al., 2008; Lalancette-Hébert et al., 2009).
The number of microglia-like cells increased in the ischemic
group, especially in layer V of the AGm and CFA motor areas,
suggesting moderate response to the post-ischemic inﬂammation
process. Such moderation may be achieved by local production of
proinﬂammatory mediators, such as IL-1b and TNFa, which
compromise the tissue, but also protect the ischemic region (Banati
et al., 1993). Microglia-like cells constitute 5–20% of the population
of glial cells in the brain, and although they are functionally
heterogeneous, they have an elongated or cigar-shaped nucleus,

and only a small number of these cells are typically recognized
(Garman, 2011). The post-ischemia microglial proliferation peaks
within 48–72 h after focal brain ischemia, and such proliferation is
morphologically similar to monocytes/macrophages in the bloodstream (Mabuchi et al., 2000; Schilling et al., 2003).
Our results indicate that experimental ischemic injury
resulted in histopathological modiﬁcations in neurons, as
indicated in both II/III and V layers. Layer V of the primary
motor area (CFA) was impaired by morphological alterations,
necrosis, apoptosis and proliferation of astrocytes, indicating
reactive gliosis (Pintea et al., 2011; Sidoryk-Wegrzynowicz et al.,
2011). Immunohistochemistry can be applied to NeuN in
neuropathological studies to highlight their physiological status.
In this work, an intense expression in NeuN ﬂuorescence was
shown by normal neurons in the control group, while decreased
NeuN ﬂuorescence in layer Vin both AGm and CFM was seen in
the ischemic group, which can be attributed to the functional
alteration of neurons post-ischemic insult. It has been suggested
that lower NeuN staining can be correlated with a decrease of
NeuN protein synthesis, or change of its antigenicity, in ischemic
areas (Ünal-Çevik et al., 2004).
GFAP staining was not positive in either the AGm or CFA motor
cortex in the control group. However, the expression of astrocyte
markers depends on species, age, anatomical location, neuropathological diseases and several other variables (Chen and Swanson,
2003; White et al., 2010). In the ischemic group, GFAP immunoreactivity was stronger in the deeper layer of CFA when compared to
the deeper layer of the AGm motor area, which is consistent with
reactive astrogliosis (Arango-Davila et al., 2004). Cerebral ischemia
induces the activation of astrocytes, resulting in GFAP expression
(Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010).
The clinical impact of ischemic stroke depends on the severity
and duration in the reduction of blood ﬂux (Mies et al., 1991).
Forty-eight hours post-cerebral ischemia, our results showed that
neurons were the cells most susceptible to ischemic injury and
necrosis and that a smaller amount of apoptotic neurons,
especially in layer V of the CFA and AGm. Astrocytes did not
show any morphological similarity to cellular necrosis or apoptosis, but rather cellular swelling as a result of brain injury.
In conclusion, our results suggest that necrosis in neurons was
caused by ischemic insult and that the CFA of the motor cortex
demonstrated relevant histopathological impairment and reactive
gliosis that could intensify stroke injury.
