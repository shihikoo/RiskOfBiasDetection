a b s t r a c t
In the current management of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), clinical criteria are used to estimate the risk of
hemorrhagic transformation (HT), which is a devastating early complication. Dynamic contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and computed tomography (DCE-CT) may serve as physiologically-based decision making tools to more reliably assess the risk of HT. Before these tools can be properly
validated, the comparability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability measurements they generate
should be assessed. Sixteen rats were subjected to a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion before
successively undergoing DCE-CT and DCE-MRI at 24-hours. BBB permeability (K trans) values were
generated from both modalities. A correlation of R = 0.677 was found (p b 0.01) and the resulting
relationship was [DCE-CT = (0.610 * DCE-MRI) + 4.140]. A variance components analysis found the
intra-rat coefﬁcient of variation to be 0.384 and 0.258 for Ktrans values from DCE-MRI and DCE-CT
respectively. Permeability measures from DCE-CT were 22% higher than those from DCE-MRI. The results of
this study demonstrate for the ﬁrst time comparability between DCE-CT and DCE-MRI in the assessment of AIS.
These results may provide a foundation for future clinical trials making combined use of these modalities.

1. Introduction
Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) causes a loss of blood–brain barrier (BBB)
integrity, which can exacerbate neuronal ischemia and lead to
hemorrhagic transformation (HT) [1–3]. The only approved treatment
for AIS is thrombolysis, which can itself further degenerate the BBB and
has been shown to increase the risk of HT [4]. The use of thrombolysis for
AIS therefore involves balancing the beneﬁt of reperfusion against the
risks of HT [5]. In order to restrict thrombolysis to AIS patients with a
lower risk of HT, clinical criteria are employed, including a strict
therapeutic window of 4.5 hours. However, advanced imaging techniques, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
(DCE-MRI) and computed tomography (DCE-CT), may serve as
physiologically-based decision making tools to improve the assessment
of HT risk in patients with AIS [6].
Both DCE-MRI and DCE-CT have undergone validation testing against
gold-standard histological techniques and are able to quantify BBB
permeability in-vivo [7–12]. After AIS, early increased BBB permeability

within infarcted brain tissue has been shown to correlate with the
eventual risk of developing HT [13]. A number of human studies have
measured BBB permeability in AIS patients with DCE-MRI [6,13–15] and
DCE-CT [16] and have predicted the eventual risk of HT with good
sensitivity and speciﬁcity. There is potential that BBB permeability
assessment may be able to improve clinical decision-making around AIS.
However, despite its beneﬁts, the clinical adoption of BBB permeability
assessment faces challenges. One challenge is the differing use of
imaging modalities between stroke treatment sites. Depending on
site-speciﬁc protocols, stroke centres may use MRI, CT, or a combination
of the two modalities during the work-up of AIS patients [17]. Thus, it is
relevant to question whether BBB permeability measurements gathered
from DCE-MRI and DCE-CT would be comparable.
To date no studies have directly measured the comparability of BBB
permeability measurements gathered from DCE-MRI and DCE-CT after
AIS within the same experiment. Such assessments are difﬁcult and
require the use of an animal model, as human experimentation would be
associated with ethical concerns due to the time-sensitive nature of AIS
management. In a rodent tumor model permeability measures from
DCE-MRI and DCE-CT were found to have non-equivalent permeability
estimates, but similar reproducibility [18]. The failure of this study to
demonstrate equivalence between DCE-MRI and DCE-CT may be

1008

explained by its usage of different pharmacokinetic models for CT and
MRI (Tofts and deconvolution physiological models). BBB permeability
values from DCE-MRI and DCE-CT for AIS patients have been published
separately but comparisons are difﬁcult as these studies have used
differing models and imaging parameters and no effort has been made to
directly compare the modalities within a single experiment [16,19,20].
As a result there is currently no consensus regarding the agreement
between DCE-MRI and DCE-CT.
In the present study we directly compared the measurement of
BBB permeability obtained successively with DCE-MRI and DCE-CT
in a rodent model of ischemic stroke with reperfusion. We
hypothesized that BBB permeability measures from the two methods
would be correlated if the same pharmacokinetic model were used.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental design
The experimental time-line is as shown in Fig. 1. Sixteen male
Sprague–Dawley rats (Charles River; MA, USA) weighing between
250 and 300 g were used for this study. Rats underwent a transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo) surgery to model AIS and
reperfusion injury [21]. Twenty-four hours later rats underwent
DCE-CT immediately followed by an MR scanning protocol that
included DCE-MRI. Following the completion of scanning all rats
were humanely sacriﬁced with an IP injection of 100 mg/kg of
phenobarbital sodium (Animal Health Inc., Quebec). The local
institutional animal care committee approved all procedures and
protocols for this study in accordance with the Canadian Council on
Animal Care requirements.
2.2. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
Rats were anesthetized (isoﬂurane 3% induction, 1–2% maintenance) and focal ischemia was induced with the tMCAo model. A
commercially available silicone-coated ﬁlament measuring
0.35 mm × 5–6 mm (Doccol, Sharon, MA) was used to increase
the reproducibility of the experimental stroke [22]. The silicone
coated suture has been shown to result in more complete occlusion
of the MCA. The middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded by the
suture for 1-hour before the suture was carefully withdrawn to
reperfuse the cerebral circulation without causing endothelial
damage. Breathing rate and temperature were monitored and
temperature was maintained at 36.1°C. Rats were given 2 mL of
saline subcutaneously immediately after and 5-hours after occlusion.
Post-operative analgesia was provided with 0.03 mg/kg Buprenorphine (RB Pharmaceuticals ltd., Berkshire).

to vibrissae touch was generated. Rats showing no neurologic deﬁcit
at 1-hour (neurologic score N 15) were excluded from the rest of
the experiment.
2.4. Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT imaging
Rats were anesthetized (insoﬂurane 3% induction, 1–2% maintenance) for both CT and MRI scans. CT data were acquired on a
pre-clinical CT scanner (Locus Ultra microCT; GE Healthcare; WI,
USA). Dynamic CT images were obtained in 42 mm coronal sections
parallel to the skull base with 0.46 mm slice thickness, 80 kV and
95 mA. In-plane image resolution was 0.15 × 0.15 mm 2 with a ﬁeld
of view of 10 cm. A 1.0 mL dose of iodinated contrast media
(Visipaque, 300 mg/ml; GE Healthcare; WI, USA) was administered
by intravenous bolus injection via the tail vein during the ﬁrst
12 seconds of the scan. Images were acquired at 1 second intervals
for the ﬁrst 30 volumes, with the remaining 15 volumes spaced
10 seconds apart. The total scan time was 3 minutes. A water
phantom was placed under the animal to aid in hysteresis correction
during post-processing. After scan completion, all data were
transferred to an independent workstation for further analysis.
2.5. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging
MRI was performed immediately after CT scanning using a 7.0 T,
30 cm NMR imaging spectrometer (Bruker Biospec 70/30; Bruker Bio
Spin MRI GmbH; Ettlingen, Germany). In addition to DCE imaging,
structural data were acquired to evaluate surgical outcome as well as the
size and location of the infarct. To maintain consistency, all structural
images were acquired with an FOV of 30 mm × 30 mm and an
acquisition matrix of 200 × 200. A time-of-ﬂight sequence (2DTOF,
TR/TE = 21.5/4.5 ms, slice = 0.4 mm) was run to conﬁrm reperfusion
in the MCA. For all other structural scans, 8 coronal slices were acquired
with a thickness of 1.0 mm. These scans included diffusion-weighted
images (DWI, with b =0,1000 s/mm 2, TR/TE = 1000/33 ms),
T1-weighted spin echo images (T1FLASH, TR/TE = 500/3 ms), and
T2-weighted turbo-spin echo images (T2RARE, TR/TE = 4800/72 ms).
Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging was acquired with an
FOV =32 × 32 × 8 mm, image acquisition matrix = 128 × 128 × 8,
ﬂip angle = 30°, and a temporal resolution = 7.25 seconds, TR =
4.83 ms, TE = 1.87 ms (where it is assumed TE bb T2*) [24,25]. A tail
vein bolus of gadolinium-DTPA (Gadovist, 2 mmol/ml; Bayer Schering;
Berlin, Germany) was injected after the acquisition of the second
dynamic of the DCE scan at a dose of 60 μL over 12 seconds. The total
acquisition time was 5:08 minutes for a collection of 42 volumes.
2.6. Image analysis

2.3. Neurologic testing
To conﬁrm success of the tMCAo, neurologic testing was
performed at 1-hour and 24-hours post-occlusion. Neurologic
testing consisted of the modiﬁed Garcia neurologic score [23].

forepaw outstretching, climbing, body proprioception, and response

procedures and imaging.

DWI data were converted to apparent diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC)
maps using an in-house software package (MR analyst v2.1) developed
in MATLAB (MathWorks; Natick, MA, USA). ADC maps were calculated
by ﬁtting the normalized logarithmic signal-intensity decay as a function of the b-values. In the ADC maps, areas of ischemia were identiﬁed
as regions of reduced diffusion when compared to the normal cortex.
Two regions of interest (ROI) were deﬁned: one placed within the core
of the diffusion abnormality (infarct) and the second in the
homologous region of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere (Fig. 2).
Infarct volumes were calculated from the ADC maps by summing the
area of the infarct ROIs across slices.
Using the MNI-register v1.4.0 tool (MINC, Montreal, QB, Canada),
images between the two modalities were manually aligned to
generate a corresponding transformation matrix for each rat. The
matrix was applied to the CT image using mincresample v1.2.1
(MINC, Montreal, QB, Canada), thus registering the CT data to the

Z. Merali et al. / Magnetic Resonance Imaging 33 (2015) 1007–1012

MRI orientation, spatial resolution and slice thickness. The accuracy
of co-registration was veriﬁed by visual inspection.
DCE data for both MRI and CT were processed using the same tool
(MR analyst) to calculate coefﬁcients of BBB permeability estimates
(K trans) from image signal intensities [26]. Prior to DCE-CT analysis,
however, hysteresis correction was performed by normalizing the
signal of each volume relative to the mean signal ﬂuctuations
observed in the water phantom. For both DCE-CT and DCE-MR
images, the signal from the sagittal sinus was sampled to generate a
vascular input function of the contrast bolus. Next, the infarct and
control ROIs, as deﬁned on each slice of the ADC maps, were overlaid
onto the DCE images. The DCE signal within each ROI was spatially
averaged to represent the time-varying tissue concentration of the
contrast agent. A unidirectional, two-compartment kinetic model
was implemented to associate the computed vessel signal intensity
and tissue signal intensity in the form of a Patlak plot. The Patlak
model does not require a pre-contrast T1 map. In DCE imaging of the
brain, the “permeability-limited” assumption can be applied and
K trans is not inﬂuenced by blood ﬂow, even when measuring regions
of cerebral infarction. For each slice, a K trans value of the infarct and
contralateral ROI was calculated from linear regression of their
respective Patlak plot as previously described [26].

2.7. Statistical analysis
The correlation between the two modalities was analyzed with a
linear random effects model with a random intercept per rat as
previously described [27]. We did not utilize a random slope per rat.
The R 2 value was calculated when both ignoring and accounting for
clustering. In this way we compared K trans values from DCE-MRI and
DCE-CT slice-by-slice while accounting for clustering within rats. The
level of agreement between rats was visualized on a Bland–Altman
plot. A variance component analysis was performed with the
restricted maximum likelihood approach to estimate the intra- and
inter-rat variance. All statistical analyses were completed in the SPSS
software (IBM—2013, v.21).

3. Results
Three rats were excluded from the experiment because of
insufﬁcient stroke size or intra-cerebral hemorrhage after surgery
leaving a ﬁnal group size of 13 rats with 49 infarcted slices for
comparison. Within this group the weight and physiologic parameters did not vary signiﬁcantly. All rats exhibited contralateral
neurologic deﬁcits 24-hours after occlusion (neurologic score b15).
All rats showed reperfusion of the ipsilateral MCA by 24-hours after
occlusion. The average infarct size 24-hours after occlusion as
measured on T2-weighted anatomic images was 0.231 ± 0.092 cm 3.
Representative permeability maps from DCE-MRI and DCE-CT are
seen in (Fig. 2.) In both modalities the Ktrans was inhomogeneous
throughout the infarct although this was more apparent in DCE-MRI. In
permeability maps from both modalities Ktrans was consistently higher
in infarcted regions than in the contralateral homologous region. In
general, DCE-MRI yielded lower K trans values within the infarct than
did DCE-CT with a mean of 6.777 mL/kg-min and 8.275 mL/kg-min for
DCE-MRI and DCE-CT respectively. The two modalities, however,
generated similar Ktrans values within the non-infarcted tissue with a
mean of 5.812 mL/kg-min and 5.429 mL/kg-min for DCE-MRI and
DCE-CT respectively. The K trans within the non-infarcted tissue
correlated signiﬁcantly between DCE-MRI and DCE-CT by a linear
mixed model, R = 0.781 (p b 0.001). The intra-rat coefﬁcient of
variation (CV) within the infarct was 0.258 and 0.384 for DCE-CT and
DCE-MRI respectively. The inter-rat CV within the infarct was 0.453
and 0.512 for DCE-CT and DCE-MRI respectively (Table 1).
The linear mixed model showed a correlation of R = 0.677
(p b 0.01) between the DCE-MRI and DCE-CT when accounting for
clustering within rats (Fig. 3). The resulting relationship was
[DCE-CT = (0.610 * DCE-MRI) + 4.140]. There was no evidence
of heteroscedasticity.
In the Bland–Altman plot the discrepancies between the two
modalities remained consistent with increasing K trans and no
proportional bias error was evident (Fig. 4). The average difference
between DCE-MRI and DCE-CT was −1.498 mL/kg-min and the
standard deviation of the differences was 2.947 mL/kg-min. The

maximum difference between the modalities was −6.695 and 98% of
the differences fell within 2 SD of the average.
4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to present a direct
comparison of BBB permeability measurements from DCE-MRI and
DCE-CT in a rodent stroke model using the same pharmacokinetic
model. DCE-MRI and DCE-CT scanning was conducted sequentially,
allowing direct comparison of BBB permeability within the same
lesion. Imaging protocols and contrast agents were chosen to
replicate those used in clinical practice as much as possible.
The intra-rat coefﬁcient of variation of K trans from DCE-CT was
0.258. A previous rodent study reported a similar value of 0.23 [18].
Studies in larger animals have also reported similar or higher values.
In implanted rabbit tumors the CV was 0.24 [28] and in dogs a value
of 0.87 [29] was reported. In our experiment DCE-MRI had an
intra-rat CV of 0.384. This value is similar to a previous study that
reported a value of 0.21 when assessing rat stroke lesions [20]. In
addition, DCE-MRI studies on rat tumor models have reported
similar values to ours [30].
The intra-rat CV was lower in DCE-CT than in DCE-MRI (0.258 vs.
0.384). Our data acquisition with DCE-CT had a higher temporal
resolution during the perfusion phase than the DCE-MRI, which may
have resulted in a more robust measurement and lower CV. In
addition, DCE-CT beneﬁts from the direct relation between Hounsﬁeld unit and iodine concentration, while DCE-MRI relies on native
tissue T1, water exchange, and contrast agent relaxivity. Regardless,
the observed difference in variation between the two modalities was
marginal and would likely not impact comparisons between BBB
permeability measures gathered from DCE-MRI and DCE-CT.
We observed that DCE-MRI tended to give lower values for BBB
permeability within infarcted tissue than DCE-CT. A previous study
that compared permeability measures between DCE-MRI and
DCE-CT in a rodent tumor model also found a systematic difference
between permeability measures from the two modalities [18]. This
ﬁnding may partially be a consequence of the shorter scan duration
of DCE-CT imposed by the clinical scanner. Studies have noted that
an abbreviated DCE protocol for both CT and MRI can overestimate
permeability measures as the transfer of contrast between blood and
tissue compartments may still be approaching equilibrium
[15,31,32]. In addition, due to the inﬂuence of MRI contrast agent
on CT density measures we were forced to always perform CT
imaging before MRI. As a result, it is possible that BBB permeability
may have been consistently affected by the prolonged anesthesia
during the second (MRI) more than in the ﬁrst (CT) portion of our
study. In a rodent model of ischemic stroke isoﬂurane has been
shown to lower blood pressure and attenuate BBB permeability in a
time-dependent fashion [33]. Lastly, Visipaque has a larger molecular weight (1550 Da vs. 605 Da) and differing polarity when
compared to Gadovist, which may affect it’s propensity to cross
the BBB.
Nonetheless, the linear mixed model revealed a correlation of
R = 0.677 between the two modalities and there was no evidence of

heteroscedasticity. The line of best ﬁt had a slope lower than the
theoretical line of agreement, which means that a simple conversion
factor may be necessary to bring the permeability measures from the
two modalities into agreement with each other. Before such a
conversion factor is proposed a better understanding of the inﬂuence
of various parameters, such as contrast agent effects and prolonged
isoﬂurane anesthesia should be achieved.
The Bland–Altman plot of permeability showed no discernible
bias across the range of permeability measures. The average
difference was below zero, reﬂecting once again the tendency for
DCE-MRI to generate lower permeability values than DCE-CT. Only
29% of observations had a difference greater than one standard
deviation from the mean. Further investigation revealed that these
observations tended to be of smaller infarcts, making it likely that

the larger discrepancy in these observations was related to the
partial volume effect near the periphery of the infarct [34]. This
illustrates the importance of strategies for ROI selection that avoid
infarct edge ‘noise’. Methods to suppress partial volume effects have
been developed and allow for accurate quantiﬁcation of subtle BBB
permeability disruptions [35]. Notwithstanding this, in our experiment, greater than 95% of the differences fell between two standard
deviations of the mean, which fulﬁlled a generally accepted standard
of repeatability between tests [36].
The correlation we identiﬁed between DCE-MRI and DCE-CT
diverges from a previous analysis, which found no correlation in a
rodent tumor model [18]. However, unlike this previous analysis, we
used the same pharmacokinetic model and similar imaging
parameters between DCE-MRI and DCE-CT. Our results demonstrate
the importance of consistent modeling between modalities if
comparable BBB permeability values are to be achieved. Due to
scanner-speciﬁc constraints, temporal resolution differed between
our DCE-MRI and DCE-CT scans. In DCE-MRI 7.25-second intervals
were used throughout, but in DCE-CT 1 second intervals during the
perfusion phase were followed by 10-second intervals during the
permeability phase. It is possible that had the temporal resolutions between the two modalities been identical, a higher degree
of correlation would have been found. The total length of image
acquisition also differed between the two modalities (5 minutes
for DCE-MRI and 3 minutes of DCE-CT). We have previously
shown that the uncertainty in K trans decreases as the length of
image acquisition increases [15]. However, only a slight improvement was found when 5 minutes of data was used as opposed to
3 minutes.
In our protocol ROIs were deﬁned slice-by-slice on ADC maps
derived from MRI and then subsequently applied to our dynamic CT
images using a transformation matrix. This presents a limitation of
our analysis, as it does not mimic a clinical scenario in which ROIs
would be deﬁned and dynamic scanning would be performed solely
using CT. However, ischemic brain tissue can be reliably distinguished from ischemic penumbra and unaffected tissue in AIS
patients by using CT perfusion imaging [37,38]. As a result, in the
clinical setting DCE-CT could be combined with CT perfusion imaging
to deﬁne the ROI. Another limitation of our study is that we manually
deﬁned the infarcted area during image analysis. Although a
quantitative method would likely be used in the clinic, manual
tracing is commonly used in pre-clinical studies and evidence
suggests that accurate and precise deﬁnition of infarcted tissue is
achieved regardless [39–41].
In the clinical setting AIS patients are most often ﬁrst imaged with
CT, but may subsequently undergo MRI during follow-up [17,42].
However, MRI is superior to CT to investigate more subtle strokes
with minimal neurologic deﬁcit [43]. The use of DCE imaging in the
clinical management of AIS patients would require BBB permeability
measures from MRI and CT to be interpreted in relation with
each other. The results of the present study indicate that
DCE-MRI and DCE-CT generate comparable measures of BBB
permeability with similar variability and could perhaps be used
interchangeably. Furthermore, although numerous trials have
demonstrated the utility of BBB permeability assessment in AIS,
these studies have been limited in their impact because of small
samples sizes [14]. All such trials have used either DCE-MRI or
DCE-CT alone. The results of the present study indicate that it
may be possible to design a trial making use of both DCE-MRI
and DCE-CT.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a correlation between BBB
permeability measures from DCE-MRI and DCE-CT after ischemia/

1011

reperfusion injury. This ﬁnding allows Ktrans values from the two
modalities to be interpreted in relation with each other and perhaps
used interchangeably. As a result, future human studies may consider
incorporating both DCE-MRI and DCE-CT into their design to assess the
robustness of these methods in larger patient populations.
