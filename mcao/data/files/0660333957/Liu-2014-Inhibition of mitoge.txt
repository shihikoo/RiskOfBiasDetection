Background and purpose: Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), particularly c-jun-N-terminal
kinases (JNK) and p38 exacerbates stroke injury by provoking pro-apoptotic and pro-inﬂammatory cellular
signaling. MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) restrains the over-activation of MAPKs via rapid de-phosphorylation
of the MAPKs. We therefore examined the role of MKP-1 in stroke and studied its inhibitory effects on MAPKs
after experimental stroke.
Methods: Male mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). MKP-1 knockout (KO)
mice and a MKP-1 pharmacological inhibitor were utilized. We utilized ﬂow cytometry, immunohistochemistry
(IHC), and Western blots analysis to explore MKP-1 signaling and its effects on apoptosis/inﬂammation in the
brain and speciﬁcally in microglia after stroke.
Results: MKP-1 was highly expressed in the nuclei of both neurons and microglia after stroke. MKP-1 genetic
deletion exacerbated stroke outcome by increasing infarct, neurological deﬁcits and hemorrhagic transformation.
Additionally, delayed treatment of the MKP-1 pharmacological inhibitor worsened stroke outcome in wild type
(WT) mice but had no effect in MKP-1 KO mice. Furthermore, MKP-1 deletion led to increased c-jun-N-terminal
kinase (JNK) activation and microglial p38 activation after stroke. Finally, MKP-1 deletion or inhibition increased
inﬂammatory and apoptotic response as evidenced by the increased levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis
factor α (TNFα), ratio of p-c-jun/c-jun and cleaved caspase-3 following ischemia.
Conclusions: We have demonstrated that MKP-1 signaling is an endogenous protective mechanism in stroke. Our
data imply that MKP-1 possesses anti-apoptotic and anti-inﬂammatory properties by simultaneously controlling
the activities of JNK and microglial p38.

Introduction
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a group of serine/
threonine protein kinases consisting of several members including
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-jun-N-terminal
kinases (JNK) and p38 (Nithianandarajah-Jones et al., 2012). MAPKs
have crucial roles in signal transduction from the cell surface to the
nucleus and regulate cell death and survival in both physiological and
pathological conditions (Nozaki et al., 2001). The importance of
MAKPs in stroke, especially JNK and p38, has been well documented
in the literature. More speciﬁcally, JNK activation has been shown to increase stroke injury via enhancement of neuronal apoptosis and both
genetic and pharmacological inhibition of JNK improved outcomes
after stroke (Cui et al., 2007; Kuan et al., 2003). P38 signaling activation
exacerbates stroke-induced inﬂammatory responses and also leads to
worse stroke outcomes (Barone et al., 2001).

MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) inactivate MAPKs rapidly and directly.
At least 10 MKPs have been identiﬁed, with MKP-1 being the archetypal
member of the MKP family (Liu et al., 2007). MKP-1 is widely expressed
in the CNS and is induced immediately in response to stressors (Horita
et al., 2010). It is regulated at both transcriptional and post-translational
levels to restrain MAPK activity (Lawan et al., 2013). MKP-1 limits the activation of MAPKs through de-phosphorylation on regulatory threonine
and tyrosine residues (Lawan et al., 2013). MKP-1 may have preferential
activity for JNK and p38 among the three MAPKs (JNK, p38 and ERK1/2)
(Farooq and Zhou, 2004).
Interestingly, MKP-1 has been implicated in the pathology of neurological disorders. A recent study demonstrated that MKP-1 is neuroprotective in Huntington's disease models, an effect attributed to its
inhibition of JNK and p38 (Taylor et al., 2013). Additionally, MKP-1 directly inhibits microglia activation (Eljaschewitsch et al., 2006), a major
contributor to the inﬂammatory response after ischemic injury. MKP-1
has been implicated in neuroprotection in several other models as well
(Eljaschewitsch et al., 2006; Koga et al., 2012). Therefore, we hypothesized that MKP-1 would play a neuroprotective role after stroke by
reducing ischemia-induced over-activation of MAPKs. In the present
study we utilized mice deﬁcient in MKP-1 and a MKP-1 inhibitor and

Stroke induced MKP-1 expression

The current study was performed in accordance with the NIH guide
for the care and use of laboratory animals. All protocols were approved
by the Center for Laboratory Animal Care of University of Connecticut
Health Center. MKP-1 KO mice were backcrossed into a C57BL/6 J
background for more than 9 generations (a kind gift from Dr. Carole
Pilbeam at UConn Health Center). WT littermates were used as controls
for MKP-1 KO mice in stroke outcome studies. C57BL/6 J WT mice used
in MKP-1 inhibitor experiments were purchased from Charles River.
There were no signiﬁcant differences in size, gross physical or behavioral
abnormalities between KO and WT control mice. Age- and weightmatched mice (20 to 25 g, 9 to 12 weeks of age) were used in all
experiments.

Six hours after the onset of ischemia, a signiﬁcant increase of MKP
protein expression in stroke mice was observed when compared to
shams by both Western blot (Fig. 1A, n = 3 p/g, p b 0.05 sham versus
stroke) and immunohistochemistry analysis (Fig. 1B, n = 3 p/g,
p b 0.05 sham versus stroke). Additionally, we found that MKP-1 colocalized with the microglial marker IBA1 and neuronal marker NeuN
(Fig. 1C and D). MKP-1 was found to be primarily localized in the nuclei
as its staining co-localized with DAPI (Fig. 1C and D).

Middle cerebral artery occlusion
Focal transient cerebral ischemia (60 minute middle cerebral artery
(MCA) occlusion) was induced in MKP-1 KO and WT mice followed by
reperfusion according to our previous publications (McCullough et al.,
2013). After 60 min occlusion, the mice were re-anesthetized and reperfused by suture withdrawal. During the ischemic period, body temperature was controlled at a physiological level using a heating pad with
the feedback thermo-control system (FST). Cerebral blood ﬂow and
physiological parameters were evaluated as described previously
(McCullough et al., 2013). Mice in the sham group underwent the
same procedure except occluding the MCA. Animals were randomized
into stroke and surgical sham cohorts. Investigators who performed
the procedures were blinded to drug treatment and genotypes.
Drug treatment
Three doses of E)-2-benzylidene-3-(cyclohexylamino)-2,3-dihydro1H-inden-1-one (BCI) (Molina et al., 2009), a MKP-1 inhibitor, were
intraperitoneally injected at 2, 24 and 48 h after stroke onset. The ﬁrst
dose of the inhibitor was given 2 h after the onset of stroke to see if
MKP-1 could be a viable target for stroke treatment. Each dose was
2.5 mg/kg and dissolved in saline containing 5% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and 1.25% Tween 20. Control mice received the equal amount
of vehicle. For dose amount, our calculations were based on mice body
size and EC50 data of BCI reported for MKP-1 in in vitro assay (Molina
et al., 2009).
Behavior measurement
Neurological deﬁcits were scored at 72 h after stroke on a four-point
scale as described previously (McCullough et al., 2013). 0, no deﬁcit; 1,
forelimb weakness and torso turning to the ipsilateral side when held
by tail; 2, circling to affected side; 3, unable to bear weight on affected
side; and 4, no spontaneous locomotor activity or barrel rolling.

Genetic deletion of MKP-1 aggravated stroke injury
MKP-1 KO mice had signiﬁcantly larger infarcts in the cortex, striatum
and total hemisphere (total: WT 40.6 ± 2.1% versus KO 55.1 ± 1.5%, n =
7 p/g, p b 0.05) 72 h after stroke onset (Fig. 2A). These larger infarcts were
also reﬂected in the neurological deﬁcit scores (ST1). Furthermore, genetic deletion of MKP-1 increased hemorrhagic transformation as measured
by hemoglobin assay 72 h after stroke (WT 114.9 ± 21.2 μg/hemisphere
versus KO 260.9 ± 44.2 μg/hemisphere, n = 7 p/g, p b 0.05) (Fig. 2C).
There was no difference in mortality rates between MKP-1 KO and WT
mice after stroke (1 out 8 in each group).
No differences were seen in mean arterial pressure, blood glucose,
pO2, pCO2, or pH between the KO and WT controls. In addition, local
cerebral blood ﬂow as measured by laser Doppler ﬂow was equivalently
reduced during ischemia and restored equally in early reperfusion in
both genotypes (ST1). Furthermore, no signiﬁcant differences in
cerebral angioarchitecture were seen between the KO and WT controls
(SF2).
Post-stroke pharmacological inhibition of MKP-1 exacerbated
stroke outcome
We then employed an MKP-1 pharmacological inhibitor, BCI to conﬁrm the deleterious effects of MKP-1 genetic deletion after stroke. In
line with the results using the genetic approach, BCI signiﬁcantly worsened infarct volume assessed 72 h following the onset of ischemia in WT
mice (n = 6 vehicle/n = 8 BCI) in cortex, striatum and total hemisphere
(total: vehicle 43.5 ± 2.6% versus BCI 56.8 ± 3.5%, p b 0.05) (Fig. 2B).
Additionally, neurological deﬁcits were aggravated in the BCI treated
mice (ST2). Furthermore, BCI treatment signiﬁcantly increased hemorrhagic transformation as measured by hemoglobin assay 72 h after
stroke (vehicle 105.6 ± 20.5 μg/hemisphere versus BCI 193.1 ±
16.9 μg/hemisphere, n = 6 vehicle/n = 8 BCI, p b 0.05) (Fig. 2D).
To verify the speciﬁcity and mechanism of the inhibitor in our
model, we injected BCI to MKP-1 KO mice and studied outcome. In the
absence of MKP-1, BCI had no effects in infarct volume or neurological
deﬁcits scores (n = 8 vehicle/n = 7 BCI) (Fig. 2E and ST2).
MKP-1 genetic deletion increased the levels of p-JNK after stroke

Infarct measurement
Brieﬂy, after the animals were sacriﬁced at 72 h after stroke, the
brains were immediately removed and cut into 5 individual 2-mm
slices. Brain slices were stained with 1.5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
(TTC) at 37 °C for 8 min. Images were digitalized, and the infarct
volumes (corrected for edema) were analyzed using computer software
(Sigmascan Pro5) as previously described (McCullough et al., 2013).
For hemoglobin assay, immune-blotting, immunohistochemistry,
ﬂow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis,

Here we focused on p-p38, p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK expression in MKP1 KO mice as studies showed that these three MAPKs are possible
substrates of MKP-1 (Farooq and Zhou, 2004). Our Western results
showed that the p-JNK level in the ischemic hemisphere was signiﬁcantly up-regulated in MKP-1 KO mice compared to WT controls 6 h
after the onset of stroke (Fig. 3A and C, p b 0.05 WT stroke versus KO
stroke n = 3 p/g). However, p-p38 and p-ERK1/2 levels in the ischemic
hemispheres did not differ between the MKP-1 KO and WT controls 6 h
after stroke (Fig. 3B, D, SF2, for p-p38, n = 2 in WT sham, KO sham and

Loss of MKP-1 led to p38 activation in microglia after stroke
As MKP-1 has been suggested to control inﬂammation by inhibiting
p38 and ERK in microglia (Eljaschewitsch et al., 2006; Yingqian et al.,
2011), we speciﬁcally investigated the change of p-p38 and p-ERK
levels in microglia in the absence of MKP-1. Interestingly, using ﬂow
cytometry, we found that the percentage of microglia positive for
p-p38 was indeed increased 6 h after stroke in MKP-1 KO mice
(Fig. 4A and B) (WT stroke 8.6 ± 2.0% versus KO stroke 16.1 ±2.1%,
p b 0.05, n = 4 in WT sham, WT stroke and KO sham; n = 3 in KO
stroke). Furthermore, p-MK2, a downstream molecule of p-p38, was
also activated in microglia in KO stroke mice (WT stroke 4.4 ± 0.7% versus
KO stroke 7.5 ± 0.4%, p b 0.05, n = 4 in WT sham; n = 3 in WT stroke, KO
sham and KO stroke) (Fig. 4A and C). However, we did not see any change
in the percentage of microglia positive for p-ERK1/2 (n = 3 p/g) (Fig. 4A
and D).

MKP-1 deletion activated apoptotic cell death pathway after stroke
As anti-apoptosis is an important property of MKP-1, we then studied
the activation of apoptotic signaling pathways in the MKP-1 KO mice
after stroke. C-jun is a direct downstream target of JNK and a critical
mediator of apoptotic cell death. Consistent with changes of activated
JNK, the ratio of p-c-jun/c-jun was signiﬁcantly higher in MKP-1 KO
mice when compared to WT controls at 6 h after the onset of stroke
(n = 3 p/g, p b 0.05) (Fig. 5A and B) although p-c-jun and c-jun levels
were not signiﬁcantly changed in MKP-1 KO mice (quantiﬁed data
not shown). Additionally, we observed that MKP-1 deletion upregulated levels of cleaved-caspase 3 compared to WT controls at 6
h after the onset of stroke (n = 2 in sham and n = 3 in stroke, p
b 0.05) (Fig. 5C and D) although cleaved-caspase 8 levels did not
differ between the MKP-1 KO stroke mice and WT controls (n = 3 p/g)
(Fig. 5E and F).

MKP-1 inhibition led to aggravated inﬂammatory response after stroke
As previous compelling evidence and our present data demonstrating
increased microglial p38 in KO mice have suggested that MKP-1 is a key
inhibitor of inﬂammatory response, we investigated the serum cytokine
levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNFα levels in the MKP-1 inhibitor treated mice
after stroke. MKP-1 inhibitor treatment enhanced the inﬂammatory
response as indicated by the higher levels of IL-6 (vehicle stroke 42.1
± 9.3 pg/ml versus BCI stroke 102.0 ± 13.9 pg/ml, p b 0.05, n = 3 in
vehicle sham, BCI sham and vehicle stroke; n = 4 in BCI stroke)
(Fig. 6A) and TNF-α (vehicle stroke 68.9 ± 18.2 pg/ml versus BCI stroke
170.6 ± 32.2 pg/ml, p b 0.05, n = 3 in vehicle sham and BCI stroke; n = 4
in vehicle stroke; n = 2 in BCI sham) (Fig. 6B) assessed at 72 h after
stroke. However, no difference was seen in IL-10 levels between vehicle
treated and drug treated groups (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
The present study identiﬁed a novel molecular signaling pathway in
stroke disease by making the following signiﬁcant new ﬁndings. First,
we demonstrated the MKP-1 is induced after stroke; we showed that
MKP-1 is highly expressed in neurons and microglia following stroke
with its expression primarily restricted in nuclei. Second, we found
that pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of MKP-1 was
detrimental in cerebral ischemia by increasing infarcts, neurological
deﬁcits and HT. Third, we showed that MKP-1 deletion signiﬁcantly
up-regulated p-JNK signaling after cerebral ischemia, as indicated
by changes in p-JNK and p-c-Jun/c-Jun levels in the ipsilateral hemispheres. Fourth, MKP-1 deletion led to activation of p38 and its downstream molecule MK2 signaling in microglia. Finally, we revealed that
MKP-1 pathway inhibition resulted in activation of both pro-apoptotic
and pro-inﬂammatory molecules including cleaved-caspase-3, IL-6
and TNFα.
The exacerbated stroke injury in MKP-1 KO mice and BCI-treated WT
mice implied that MKP-1 normally mediates neuroprotective signaling.
MKP-1, a phosphatase of MAPKs, is rapidly induced in nuclei by many of
the same stress conditions that activate MAPKs (Liu et al., 2007). In a

neuroblastoma cell line subjected to hypoxia/reoxygenation, knockdown of MKP-1 using SiRNA enhanced pJNK levels and neuronal
death that was rescued by JNK inhibitor. In other studies MKP-1 overexpression reduced levels of pJNK, the expression of proapoptotic
genes, and decreased cell death (Koga et al., 2012). These data suggested that MKP-1 signaling enhances survival under hypoxic stress,
consistent with our results. In a most recent study, it was proposed
that MKP-1 may enhance hippocampal neuronal apoptosis in a global
ischemia model as it inhibited C/EBPβ, which has been shown to have
anti-apoptotic properties (Rininger et al., 2012). However, in a focal
cerebral ischemia model, C/EBPβ loss-of-function was in fact neuroprotective (Kapadia et al., 2006). It is very likely that MKP-1's functions are
dependent on the particular cellular and pathological contexts. Our
pharmacological approach clearly conﬁrmed our results obtained
using the genetic deletion model, suggesting that MKP-1 signaling is
pro-survival in stroke.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study in which a pharmacological MKP-1 inhibitor was employed in a stroke model. BCI functions by locking its substrate phosphatases in low activity conformation
(Molina et al., 2009). Of note, it has been shown that, besides inhibiting
MKP-1, BCI also has shown effects on MKP-3 in a transgenic zebraﬁsh
chemical screen model (Molina et al., 2009). However, in our study,

BCI completely lost its detrimental effect at the absence of MKP-1,
suggesting that MKP-1 was the speciﬁc target of this compound in our
stroke model. It is plausible that MKP-3 plays a less important role in
neuroprotection in stroke. MKP-3 resides in the cytosol and is an ERKspeciﬁc MKP. It is often induced by neuronal differentiation but not by
mitogens or stress (Muda et al., 1996). Indeed, in a Huntington disease
model, MKP-3 manipulation was not effective in cellular survival/
death and had no effects on JNK and p38 activities (Taylor et al.,
2013). Our data and others indicate that MKP-1 may possess a unique
proﬁle of enzymatic and neuroprotective activities in stroke compared
with MKP-3 (Taylor et al., 2013).
MKP-1 serves as a convergence point in the MAPK pathway (Boutros
et al., 2008). In our work, we found that MKP-1 deletion increased the
levels of both p-JNK and p-p38 in microglia while no effect was
observed on p-ERK. Other studies also found that MKP-1 was speciﬁc
for JNK and p38. In mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts, MKP-1 deletion had
no effects on ERK activation during serum stimulation (Dorfman et al.,
1996). Additionally, MKP-1 deﬁciency enhanced LPS stimulated JNK
and p38 activities but had little effect on ERK activity in primary macrophage cell culture (Zhao et al., 2006). In a Huntington disease model in
rats, MKP-1 afforded its neuroprotection through functioning as a
phosphatase for pJNK and p-p38, not p-ERK (Taylor et al., 2013).

D, n = 2 in sham; n = 3 in stroke.

Therefore, ours and others' work (Zhao et al., 2006) imply that under
most physiological as well as pathological conditions, JNK and p38, but
not ERK, are the preferred targets of MKP-1.
In this study, we evaluated the effect of MKP-1 in apoptosis after
stroke as the majority of published work suggests an anti-apoptotic
role of this molecule in stressed neurons. In cultured sympathetic neurons, MKP-1 overexpression led to JNK inhibition and reduced apoptosis
induced by NGF (nerve growth factor) withdrawal while MKP-1 knockdown accelerated NGF withdrawal-induced death (Kristiansen et al.,
2010). As described previously, MKP-1 suppressed neuronal apoptosis
through JNK signaling inhibition in neuroblastoma cell line culture in a
hypoxia-reoxygenation model (Koga et al., 2012). In line with others'
work, our work demonstrated an induction of MKP-1 in the nuclei of
neurons 6 h after stroke and our data additionally showed that the
ratio of p-c-jun/c-jun was increased in MKP-1 KO stroke mice, so did
cleaved caspase-3, the executioner caspase in the apoptotic cell death
pathway. Activated caspase-8 was not changed with MKP-1 deletion,
suggesting that the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, which is activated by
caspase-8 (Tait and Green, 2010), may play a less important role than
the intrinsic pathway in MKP-1/JNK apoptotic signaling. The underlying
mechanisms warrant further investigation; however, our data clearly
showed that MKP-1 serves as an endogenous suppressor of apoptotic
cell death after stroke.
Our work also revealed a critical role of MKP-1 in restraining inﬂammatory response after stroke. Compelling evidence has shown that
MKP-1 is a key negative modulator of innate immune responses, as
well as a regulator of adaptive immune responses (Korhonen et al.,

2013). For instance, MKP-1 KO macrophages produced excessive
amounts of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-6, and IL-10 (Zhao et al.,
2006). In patients with multiple-sclerosis, MKP-1 co-localized with
invading microglia and MKP-1 inhibited microglia activation in NMDA
induced toxicity models in co-culture of brain slice and microglia
(Eljaschewitsch et al., 2006). Interestingly, we found that MKP-1 was
highly expressed in the nuclei of microglial cells after stroke and MKP1 inhibition signiﬁcantly induced increased levels of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines IL-6 and TNFα mice 6 h after stroke. Additionally, our ﬂow
cytometry data demonstrated that MKP-1 deletion speciﬁcally enhanced p-p38 levels and its downs stream molecule p-MK2 in microglia,
while no effect was detected when p-38 was simply examined in the
whole stroke hemispheres. Our results suggest that MKP-1 speciﬁcally
targets p38 in microglia and its anti-inﬂammatory effects are mediated
by p38. Microglial cells are the main resident immune cells in the central
nervous system and are activated rapidly (within minutes) by cerebral
ischemia (Patel et al., 2013). Microglia activation plays critical roles in
brain ischemia, inﬂammation and neurodegeneration (Patel et al.,
2013). p38 activation in microglia through various pathways has been
demonstrated to be essential for IL-1, IL-6, TNFα, cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression
(Koistinaho and Koistinaho, 2002). Indeed, pharmacological inhibition
of p-p38 restrained microglia activation and reduced stroke injury
(Piao et al., 2003). The mechanisms are not completely clear but it is
thought that p38 enhances the stabilization and promotes translation
of mRNAs which encode the pro-inﬂammatory molecules. Taken together, our work showed that MKP-1 may limit microglia activation

inhibitor sham. #p b 0.05: vehicle stroke versus MKP-1 inhibitor stroke (one-way ANOVA with post-hoc test); data were presented as mean ± SEM.

induced inﬂammatory response by inhibiting microglial p38 in stroke. Of
note, TNFα is known to enhance activation and trafﬁcking of neutrophils
(Pouliot and Serhan, 1999), which is well documented to aggravate BBB
disruption in the ischemic brain by releasing matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) (McCullough et al., 2013). Therefore, the exacerbated inﬂammatory response seen with MKP-1 inhibition may also shed light onto the
increased hemorrhagic transformation observed in both the KO mice
and inhibitor treated mice following stroke.
In summary, we demonstrated the detrimental effects of MKP-1
inhibition in cerebral ischemia. Our data suggested that MKP-1 simultaneously targets p-JNK and microglial p-p38 signaling after stroke, subsequently inactivating pro-apoptotic and pro-inﬂammatory pathways.
Compelling evidence has now suggested that both inﬂammation and apoptotic responses are major contributors of neuronal death after stroke,
particularly in the delayed phase. Our work implies that targeting
MKP-1 could have a potential value for stroke treatment.
