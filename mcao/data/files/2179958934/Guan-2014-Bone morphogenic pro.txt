Bone Morphogenic Protein-7 Contributes to Cerebral Ischemic
Preconditioning Induced-Ischemic Tolerance by Activating p38
Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Signaling Pathway
Junhong Guan,1,3 Han Li,2 Tao Lv,1 Duo Chen,1 Ye Yuan,1 and Shengtao Qu1

Abstract—Cerebral ischemic preconditioning (IPC), which refers to a transient and noninjurious ischemia is able to induce tolerance against the subsequent lethal ischemia, including ischemic stroke. We
have previously reported that bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP-7) contributes to the neuroprotective
effects of IPC-induced ischemic tolerance, and thus ameliorates the following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
injury in rats. Consequently, in the present study, we continued to explore the underlying regulatory
mechanisms involved in BMP-7-mediated cerebral IPC in the rat model of ischemic tolerance. Male
Wistar rats were preconditioned by 15-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). After 2-day reperfusion, these animals were subjected to prolonged MCAO for 2 h. Our results showed that the phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) paralleling to BMP-7 was up-regulated by
IPC in rat brain. Inactivation of p38 MAPK by pretreatment of SB203580, a p38 MAPK-specific suppressor, weakened the protective effect of IPC on CA1 neurons. Moreover, the enhanced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK induced by IPC was attenuated when the endogenous BMP-7 was inhibited by BMP7 antagonist noggin. Besides, blockade of p38 MAPK signal transduction pathway via SB203580 abrogated the protective effects of exogenous BMP-7 against cerebral infraction. These present findings
suggest that BMP-7 contributes to cerebral IPC-induced ischemic tolerance via activating p38 MAPK
signaling pathway.

risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia [5, 6], the therapeutic effects of pharmacological
treatments are relatively limited [7]. Emerging evidence
has proven that the brain has a remarkable capacity for
self-preservation [8]. A brief period of cerebral ischemia,
also known as ischemic preconditioning (IPC), confers
transient tolerance to a subsequent ischemic challenge in
the brain [9]. The endogenous mechanisms related to cerebral IPC are thus being widely studied.
Bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP-7) is a member of
the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) superfamily
[10], and has been reported to mimic the effects of IPC to
protect against intestinal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced intestinal and hepatic injuries in rats [11]. In accordance with these findings, our prior results have demonstrated that BMP-7 mediates IPC-induced ischemic tolerance in rats suffered from cerebral ischemia [12]. However,
the underlying mechanisms are required to be fully
elucidated.

INTRODUCTION
Cerebral stroke continues to be a major cause of death
and the leading cause of long-term disability worldwide [1,
2] and approximately 85 % of all the cerebral strokes are
ischemic in nature [3]. Ischemic strokes, resulting from
thrombus or embolism-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), usually lead to severe brain lesions including neuronal degradation and cerebral infarction [4].
Although progress has been made in stroke prevention,
which focuses on optimizing the treatment of modifiable

The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
plays a pivotal role in regulating many cellular processes
including inflammation, cell differentiation, cell growth,
and death [13, 14]. Activation of p38 MAPK via extracellular stimuli such as bacterial pathogens and cytokines,
mediates signal transduction into the nucleus to turn on
the responsive genes [15]. Notably, plenty of researches
have delineated BMP-7 as an upstream regulatory factor in
p38 MAPK signaling transduction pathway. Exogenous
BMP-7 is proven to induce the activation of p38 MAPK
in murine renal epithelial cells [16] and human proximal
tubule epithelial cells [17]. However, discrepant effects of
BMP-7 on p38 MAPK signaling have been observed in
several other cell lines. For instance, BMP-7 is observed to
directly suppress the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in
human breast cancer cells [18] and articular chondrocytes
[19]. These results indicate a multiple role of BMP-7 in
regulating p38 MAPK signal at cellular level. Interestingly,
a study from Nishimura et al. has illustrated that a 2-min
global ischemia enhances the phosphorylation of p38
MAPK in the hippocampus of gerbils after I/R [20], implying the activation of p38 MAPK may be implicated in
IPC-induced ischemic tolerance of the brain. Nevertheless,
whether p38 MAPK is involved in IPC-induced ischemic
tolerance related to BMP-7 is still unclear and requires to
be further studied.
Therefore, in this study, a rat model of ischemic
tolerance induced by short-term MCAO preconditioning
was used to examine whether BMP-7 exerted its protective
effects via p38 MAPK signaling pathway in cerebral ischemic injury.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal Model and Experimental Grouping
Male Wistar rats, weighing from 280 to 320 g, were
obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of China
Medical University and were housed at a constant room
temperature (20–22ºC) and humidity (50–60 %) with a 12h light and 12-h dark cycle. The animal experimental
protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of
China Medical University which conforms to the provisions of the declaration of Helsinki in 1995 (as revised in
Edinburgh 2000).
According to previous reported surgical procedures
[21] with minor modifications, a rat model of ischemic
tolerance was reproduced. Briefly, the right internal carotid
artery (ICA) was carefully isolated and exposed, a 4–0

Guan, Li, Lv, Chen, Yuan, and Qu
monofilament nylon suture with a rounded tip was introduced into the ICA lumen through the external carotid
artery stump until faint resistance was felt. Cerebral IPC
was induced by 15-min occlusion, and then the suture was
gently withdrawn to permit blood perfusion. Sham-operated rats underwent the same procedure except the suture
was not inserted. Forty-eight hours later, the suture was
reinserted to induce ischemia by blocking the blood flow
for 2 h, and then the suture was again slowly withdrawn to
permit reperfusion. Rectal temperature was monitored and
maintained between 36.5 and 37.5 °C using a temperatureregulated heating lamp throughout the experiment.
Thereafter, rats were sacrificed at different time points for
the following studies.
Part I. The Time-Course Expression of BMP-7, Total
and Phosphorylated p38 MAPK after IPC
Rats were divided into two groups: (1) Sham, the rats
received sham surgery and (2) IPC, the rats were subjected
to MCAO preconditioning for 15 min. Rats from group 2
were decapitated at 0, 1, 6, 12, 24, or 48 h after the sublethal ischemic treatment (n=5 per time point) and their
brain tissues were used to detect the protein expression of
BMP-7 and total and phosphorylated p38 MAPK. The
expression levels of these three proteins obtained from rats
sacrificed immediately after the sham operation served as
controls (n=5).
Part II. The Effect of p38 MAPK Inhibitor SB203580
on IPC-Induced Neuroprotection in Rat Brain after I/R
Injury
To determine whether the activation of p38 MAPK
could affect IPC-induced neuroprotection, 25 μL 2 %
DMSO with or without 100-μM SB203580 (SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), a pharmacologic p38
MAPK inhibitor [22], was injected into rat brain at
30 min before sham or IPC operation: (3) IS, the rats only
received 2-h MCAO; (4) IPC + IS, the rats received 15-min
MCAO, recovered for 48 h, and then underwent prolonged
MCAO for 2 h; (5) IPC + IS + SB203580, the rats received
intracranial injection of SB203580 before any ischemic
treatment; (6) IPC + IS + DMSO, the rats were injected
with DMSO before any ischemic treatment; and (7) Sham
+ SB203580, normal rats received SB203580 injection
before sham operation. Rats from the above five groups
along with the ones from groups 1 and 2 were sacrificed
after 7-day reperfusion and their brain tissues were used for
neuropathological evaluation (n=6 per group).

Part III. The Phosphorylation Levels of p38 MAPK in Rat
Brain at Different Ischemic Conditions
To explore whether the phosphorylation of p38
MAPK is regulated by BMP-7 during IPC-induced ischemic tolerance, we measured the phosphorylation of p38
MAPK in the presence or absence of noggin (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), a BMP-7 antagonist [23].
Twenty-five microliter normal saline with or without 2-μg
noggin was intracranially injected into rats 30 min before
IPC operation: (8) IPC + IS + Noggin; (9) IPC + IS +
Saline. The brain samples from the above two groups were
subjected to Western blot analysis for total and phosphorylated p38 MAPK (n=5 per group). Meanwhile, brain
tissues from groups 1 to 4 were also used to detect the
phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK.
Part IV. The Effect of p38 MAPK Inhibitor SB203580
on BMP-7-Induced Protective Effect against I/R Injury
Recombinant BMP-7 (R&D systems; 30 μM in 25μL normal saline) was given intracerebroventricularly in
rats at 24 h before the 2-h MCAO. Next, these rats were
administrated with intracranial injection of SB203580
(100 μM in 25 μL 2 % DMSO) at 30 min before the 2-h
MCAO and allowed to recover for 24 h. Assessment of
cerebral infract volume was performed in rats from the
following groups (n=6 per group): (10) BMP-7 + IS; (11)
BMP-7 + IS + SB203580; (12) BMP-7 + IS + DMSO. Rats
from groups 3 to 4 were also subjected to detect the
cerebral infracted volume.

Neuropathological Evaluation
Animals were decapitated at 7 days after the last
ischemic insult, and 3-mm thick brain samples, including
the bilateral dorsal hippocampus, were excised coronally
and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 6 h. Two days later,
the brain tissues were embedded in paraffin and cut into 6μm thick sections. Next, these sections were dehydrated
with alcohol, cleared with xylene, stained with thionine
(Solarbio, Beijing, China), and then subjected to histological grade (HG) and neuronal density (ND) assessments
[24, 25]. HG was detected under a light microscope: 0, no
neuron death; I, scattered single neuron death; II, mass
neuron death; and III, almost complete neuron death.
Meanwhile, the average number of surviving and normal
pyramidal neurons in six regions within 1-mm linear length
of the hippocampal CA1 subfield was calculated as the ND
value for each hippocampus.
Assessment of Cerebral Infarct Volume
According to a previous reported protocol [26], brain
tissue slices of rats from different experimental groups
were subjected to infarction assessment. In brief, at 24 h
after I/R, rats were decapitated and the brains were dissected, immersed in ice-cold saline for 5 min, and sliced into
2.0-mm thick sections for triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC; Sigma-Aldrich) assessment. The percentage of the
infarct volume was determined by indirect measurement
based on the noninfracted cortex volume.
Statistical Analysis

Western Blot analysis
Protein samples from the ipsilateral ischemic cortex
were extracted and subjected to Western blot analysis.
Equivalent amounts of proteins were fractionated on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
After blocking with 5 % (w/v) skim milk, the membranes
were immunoblotted overnight at 4ºC with polyclonal
antibodies against BMP-7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA), p38 MAPK (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Thereafter, the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies at room
temperature for 45 min, and the protein blots on the membranes were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Millipore) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. β-actin served as control.

All results were presented as the mean±standard deviation (SD). The data were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc test for multiple
comparisons using SPSS 17.0 program. A P value less than
0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

RESULTS
The Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK is Enhanced
by Cerebral IPC in Rats
Rats that underwent 15-min MCAO preconditioning
were sacrificed at 0, 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after reperfusion,
and the brain tissues were subjected to determine the
protein expression levels of BMP-7, p38 MAPK, and
phosphorylated p38 MAPK. As compared with sham
group, BMP-7 protein increased gradually after IPC treatment, with the highest value observed after 24-h

reperfusion (Fig. 1a). The expression pattern of the activated p38 MAPK was similar to that of BMP-7 during the
whole process (Fig. 1b), whereas the total p38 MAPK
expression levels were unchanged (Fig. 1b). The similar
expression patterns of BMP-7 and phospho-p38 MAPK in
rat brain indicated a potential interplay between them in
IPC-induced tolerance.

SB203580 Attenuates IPC-Induced Improvement
of Neuronal Morphology after Cerebral I/R Injury
in Rats
To explore the role of p38 MAPK in IPC-induced
ischemic tolerance in rat brain, the p38 MAPK-specific
suppressor SB203580 [22] was used to inhibit the activation of p38 MAPK. Rats from different experimental
groups were humanely killed at 7 days after the last treatment, and the morphologic changes of CA1 neurons were
examined by thionine staining. We observed normal pyramidal neurons with clear cell outline and compact and
abundant cytoplasm in the hippocampal CA1 subfield of
sham-operated rat brains (Fig. 2a, b). No evident neuronal
damage was found in the brain tissues from IPC group
(Fig. 2c). Moreover, the severe neuronal degeneration induced by lethal cerebral ischemia (Fig. 2d) could be mitigated significantly if IPC was induced in the brain in
advance (Fig. 2e). However, this neuroprotective effect of

Guan, Li, Lv, Chen, Yuan, and Qu
IPC in ischemic injury was abolished by SB203580
(Fig. 2f) as compared with DMSO-treated group
(Fig. 2g). Additionally, the neurons of sham rats received
DMSO injection remained untouched (Fig. 2h). The above
observations were further confirmed by HG and ND analyses (Table 1). Collectively, the present morphological
results demonstrated that inactivation of p38 MAPK could
abolish the neuroprotection of IPC-induced ischemic tolerance against the subsequent detrimental ischemia.

Noggin Reduces IPC-Induced Phosphorylation
Increase of p38 MAPK in Rat Brain
Since p38 MAPK is believed to be an effector of BMP7 in various physiological processes in vertebrates [27], we
determined whether the activation of p38 MAPK could be
regulated by BMP-7 during IPC-induced ischemic tolerance.
As compared with the sham group, the expression level of
phosphorylated p38 MAPK significantly increased in IPC
rats but markedly decreased in IS rats (Fig. 3). Furthermore,
down-regulation of phospho-p38 MAPK caused by lethal
ischemia could be partially reversed by cerebral IPC treatment
(Fig. 3). However, this IPC-enhanced phosphorylation of p38
MAPK was abolished when BMP-7 was inhibited by noggin
(Fig. 3). Such results indicated that the phosphorylation of
p38 MAPK was regulated by BMP-7 during IPC-induced
ischemic tolerance process in rat brain.

and phosphorylated p38 MAPK (b) determined by Western blot analysis at 0, 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h (n=5 per time point) after 15-min middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO)-induced ischemic preconditioning (IPC). β-actin served as endogenous control. Data were presented as mean±standard deviation (SD).

Exogenous BMP-7 Fails to Reduce the Lethal
Ischemia-Induced Cerebral Infraction when p38
MAPK Signaling Pathway is Blocked
To further elucidate whether BMP-7 provides protection against I/R injury via p38 MAPK transduction pathway, exogenous recombinant BMP-7 was given into rat
brain at 24 h before the harmful ischemic treatment.
Similar to the effect of IPC, exogenous BMP-7 markedly
decreased the brain infraction caused by lethal ischemia
after 24 h reperfusion (Fig. 4). In addition, pre-injection
SB203580 at 30 min before the last ischemic insult diminished exogenous BMP-7-induced reduction of cerebral

infraction (Fig. 4). These data demonstrated that the exogenous BMP-7 induced ischemic tolerance in rat brain by
activating p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

DISCUSSION
Ischemic stroke, resulting either from global or focal
decreases in perfusion, seriously threaten human health [9],
and the endogenous self-protective mechanisms against
this disease are currently being widely studied. We have
prior demonstrated that BMP-7 contributes to the

neuroprotective effects of IPC-induced tolerance in
rat brain [12]. Nevertheless, how BMP-7 regulates
ischemic tolerance in the brain needs further
investigations.
Part of the cellular response to I/R injury involves
activation of several members of the MAPKs, including
the p38 MAPK [28]. An earlier study from Dreixler et al.
has shown that the phosphorylated p38 MAPK protein is
increased with retinal IPC in rats [29]. As a support to this
previous research, we found that IPC occurred in the brain
could activate p38 MAPK in rats. Similar stimulatory
effect of IPC on p38 MAPK has also been reported in
gerbils [20]. Besides, the expression pattern of phosphop38 MAPK was similar to that of BMP-7, indicating the
involvement of p38 MAPK in BMP-7-mediated IPC in rat
brain.
Whether the ischemia-induced activation of p38
MAPK is beneficial or deleterious in the brain still remains
controversial. Some studies indicate that the activation of
p38 MAPK during IPC exerts beneficial effect in rabbit
heart [30] and gerbil hippocampus [20], respectively. On
the contrary, it has been proven by several other researches
that inhibition of p38 MAPK protects the heart [31] and
liver [32] of rodents against ischemic damage. To determine the effect of p38 MAPK activation on cerebral IPCinduced protection, SB203580 was used to suppress p38
MAPK phosphorylation in rat brain. The morphological
results of CA1 neurons showed that inhibition of p38
MAPK activation attenuated the protective activity of
IPC to the following ischemic insult. Additionally, suppression of p38 MAPK activation via small interfering

RNA (siRNA) or the antagonist SB203580 is found to
reduce the protective effects of IPC against retinal function
after ischemia [29]. Such earlier research along with ours
indicated that p38 MAPK activation contributed to the
protective effect of cerebral IPC.
Plenty of studies have delineated BMP-7 as a mediator of p38 MAPK signaling pathway [17, 18]. In our study,
we noted an interesting phenomenon that the expression
pattern of phosphorylated p38 MAPK paralleled to that of
BMP-7 after IPC in brain. Nonetheless, whether the activation of p38 MAPK is regulated by BMP-7 during cerebral IPC-induced tolerance is unclear. To address this question, the experimental rats were given intracranial administration of BMP-7 suppressor noggin before they were
subjected to preconditioning or injurious ischemic

Fig. 3. Noggin attenuates IPC-induced increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation after I/R injury in rat brain. The protein expression levels of total and
phosphorylated p38 MAPK were determined by Western blot analysis at
24 h after the last ischemic treatment. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK
was increased in ischemic preconditioning (IPC) group, but decreased in
ischemia (IS) group. Inhibition of BMP-7 by noggin diminished IPC-induced up-regulation of phospho-p38 MAPK. The total p38 MAPK remained unchanged in all the experimental groups. β-actin served as endogenous control. Data were presented as mean±standard deviation (SD) (n=
5 per group). *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.

exogenous BMP-7 was intracranially injected into rats 24 h
before noxious ischemic treatment to mimic IPC effects.
Data showed that pretreatment of recombinant BMP-7
significantly mitigated injurious ischemia-caused cerebral
infraction. However, this protective effect of exogenous
BMP-7 was abrogated when p38 MAPK signaling pathway was blocked by SB203580. Collectively, these present
results provided valid evidence to demonstrate that BMP-7
contributed to IPC-induced ischemic tolerance by activating p38 MAPK signaling pathway in the brain after I/R
injury.
In summary, this study provides potent evidences to
demonstrate that BMP-7 contributes to IPC-induced ischemic tolerance by activating p38 MAPK signaling pathway
in rat brain.

rats undergoing ischemia, whereas this reduction could be
