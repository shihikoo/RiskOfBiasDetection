Summary: This study aimed to investigate inflammatory edema after cerebral ischemia through 7.0T
MRI and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). All SD rats were randomly divided into
sham operated group and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-1 day, -3 day and -7 day groups.
MRI scan of the brain was performed on a 7.0 Tesla MRI scanner. The volume of positive signals in
the ischemic side was detected by using a T2 weighted spinecho multislice sequence; the changes in
the height of water-peak were measured with point resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequences; cortical edema was detected by using wet-dry weight method; the degrees of nerve injury were evaluated
by Bederson neurological score system; double-labeling immunofluorescence technique was used to
explore the molecular mechanisms of post-ischemia cerebral edema. The results showed that high
T2WI signals were observed in MCAO-1 day, -3 day and -7 day groups, and the water-peak height
and water-peak area of MCAO groups were higher than those of sham operated group (P<0.05).
Neurological score results were consistent with the degree of brain edema, and a large number of microglia accumulated in the ischemic cortex. Our results suggested that non-invasive MRI technology
with the advantage of high spatial resolution and tissue resolution can comprehensively and dynamically observe inflammatory edema after cerebral ischemia from a three-dimensional space, and contribute to evaluation and treatments in clinic.

Currently, CT, PET, SPECT, and MRI neuron-imaging technologies are extensively applied in basic neuroscience researches and clinical diagnosis.
Non-invasive MRI can be used for the evaluation of
morphology, metabolism and physiological functions of
brain tissues[1, 2]. In recent years, introduction of 3.0Tesla,
7.0Tesla and 13.0Tesla MRI scanning systems not only
enhances the spatial and density resolution but also substantially improves the sensitivity of MRS signals[3].
Cerebral inflammatory edema after ischemia is a
complicated pathophysiological process, involving glial
activation and damage of blood brain barrier (BBB).
Edema per se is the result of unbalanced distribution of
water, manifested as T2WI signal abnormalities on MRI.
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is capable of
dynamically obtaining detailed pathological information
of neuronal injuries and micro-glial reaction in vivo[4].
This study, on the basis of T2WI and point resolved
spectroscopy (PRESS) sequences on 7.0Tesla MRI, examined the changes in cerebral edema volume in
ischemic penumbra, explored the application of

non-invasive MRI in the detection of cortical edema on
the ischemic side and preliminarily discussed molecular
mechanisms of post-ischemia cerebral edema.
1 SUBJECTS AND METHODS
1.1 Animals and Grouping
Forty-five SPF adult male Sprague-Dawley rats,
weighing 250–280 g, were randomly divided into sham
operated group (n=15), MCAO-1 day (n=10), -3 day (n=
10) and -7 day (n= 10) groups. The experimental protocol was approved by Animal Care and Use Committee of
Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong
Universitiy of Science and Technology, China
1.2 Establishment of MCAO Model
By using Connolly’s method[5], animals were anesthetized by mask inhalation anesthesia when fixed on
supine position. After a neck incision was made, the right
carotid sheath was exposed, the external carotid artery
was ligated, and the proximal carotid artery was cut open.
Afterwards, the silicone-coated nylon thread was inserted
into the internal carotid artery 18 mm along the carotid
artery to block the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery.
Then, the nylon thread was fixed and taken out 1 h after
MCAO. The animals in the sham-operated group were
subjected to the same procedure save that no thread was
inserted. The rectal temperature was maintained at
(37±0.5)°C during the surgical procedure. Animals were

121

killed 1, 3 and 7 days after MCAO respectively and then
the samples were harvested.
1.3 MRI Scanning
MRI Scanning was performed on a 7.0Tesla MRI
scanner (Bruker PharmaScan, Bruker BioSpin, Germany).
Animals were anesthetized and anchored in prone position on a scanning bed, with head fixed. T2WI sequence
was scanned (TR=4200 ms, TE=36 ms, sampling matrix
256×256, slice thickness 0.8 mm, Layer spacing 1 mm,
13 layers in all, visual field 3.5 cm×3.5 cm). On coronal
planes, the cortical edema of the right side was selected,
and the cubic regions of interest (3 mm×3 mm) were
chosen. Following shimming and suppression of water,
PRESS sequence was used to acquire 1H spectrum
(spectral width: 1500 Hz, sample points 2048, TR=2500
ms, TE=20 ms, cumulative number: 500 times). Then, on
the basis of obtained 1H spectra and after baseline correction of Fourier transform spectra, the chemical shift of
water peak was found to be 4.7 ppm on MRS. The height
of each water-peak was measured and peak areas were
calculated. The height of mI (crest located at 3.56 ppm)
was also determined.
1. 4 Neurological Scores
By using Bederson’s scoring system[6], neurological
deficits were measured on a 5-point scale, with 0 point
listed as no deficit; 1 point as inability to fully extend the
contralateral fore-paw; 2 points as turning to right side
when crawling; 3 points as leaning to the paralyzed side
when walking; 4 points as inability to conduct spontaneous activity.
1.5 Cerebral Water Content
Cerebral water content was determined by wet-dry
weight method immediately after animal were sacrificed.
Wet weight was measured, and then the brains were
dried at 60°C in an oven for 48 h to a constant weight.
The dry weight was measured, and cerebral water content was calculated by using the following formula:

Cerebral water content (%)=(Wet weight–Dry
weight)/ Wet weight×100%.
1.6 Immunofluorescence Staining
Frozen sections (thickness of 30 μm) of ischemic
cortex were placed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate
buffer at 4°C for 15 min, washed with PBS (5 min×3
times), put in 1% Triton for permealization for 15 min at
room temperature, washed with PBS and finally sealed at
room temperature for 2 h. The samples were incubated
with microglia-specific mouse anti-OX-42 antibody
(1:100, Chemicon, USA) at 4°C overnight, then with
FITC-labeled anti-mouse IgG at room temperature for 1
h, washed with PBS, incubated with DAPI for 10 min.
Finally, the samples were sealed with glycerin and observed under a laser confocal microscope and fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51) (at FITC excitation
wavelength of 490 nm, emission wavelength of 520 nm).
1.7 Statistical Analysis
The SPSS13.0 software package was used for statistical analysis. The data were expressed as ±s, and single factor analysis of variance was employed for data
analysis. A P<0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.
2 RESULTS
2.1 Changes in MRI T2WI Image
T2WI sequences clearly showed cerebral anatomical structures. The T2WI image did not reveal conspicuous abnormalities in the sham-operated group. In MCAO
group, high T2WI signals were observed in the ipsilateral
cortex 1 day after ischemia. The T2WI signal intensity
and volume gradually increased and reached a peak 3
days after MCAO. The volume of high T2WI signal was
252.2±6.73 mm3, 323.5±12.14 mm3 and 185.33±8.94
mm3 1, 3 and 7 day(s) after brain ischemia (fig. 1).

2.2 MRS
The water-peak height of the sham-operated group
was taken as 100, and the height of MCAO-1 day, -3 day,
-7 day groups was 354.6±23.8, 412.6±28.92 and

392.1±25.44, respectively. When water-peak area of the
sham-operated group was taken as 100, the area of
MCAO-1 day, -3 day, -7 day groups was 322.8±34.56,
389.33±40.9 and 357.88±25.46, respectively, with the

122
differences between them being statistically significant
(P<0.05). mI/Cr ratio (Cr is always used to standardize
the result) was 0.54±0.08 and 0.82±0.11 in the

2.3 Neurological Scores
After awakening from anesthesia, the neurological
scores of the animals were obtained. In the
sham-operated group, animals showed no obvious neurological deficit symptoms, and neurological score was 0
point. In MCAO-1 day, -3 day and -7 day groups, the
scores were 2.6±0.32, 3.4±0.44 and 1.7±0.23, respectively. There existed a significant difference in neurological score between the sham-operated group and
MCAO groups (P<0.05) (fig. 3).
2.4 Cerebral Water Content
Water content of brain tissue was (78.5±0.5)% in
the sham operated group, while the water content in
MCAO-1 day, -3 day and -7 day groups were
(84.9±0.32)%, (88.7±0.44)% and (82.7±0.23)%, respectively and the difference between the sham operated group
and MCAO groups was statistically significant (P<0.05)
(fig. 4).
2.5 Immunohistochemical Findings in Microglial
Cells in Ischemic Cortex
Only a few sparsely distributed OX-42-positive microglia were found in ischemic cortex of the sham operated group. On the other hand, OX-42-positive cells were
increased significantly in the MCAO groups and density
of OX-42-positive cells in MCAO-1 day group was
(152.7±4.8)% of that in the sham operated group. The
number of OX-42-positive cells was greatest in MCAO-3
day group and the density of OX-42 positive cells was
(185.4±6.2)% of that in the sham operated group. A large
number of OX-42-positive cells could still be found in
ischemic penumbra in MCAO-7 day group and the den-

sity of OX-42 cells was (132±4.77)% of that in the
sham-operated group (fig. 5).

3 DISCUSSION
This study used 7.0T MRI and MRS to detect inflammatory edema and found that the signals were
higher on T2WI image after MCAO. MRS showed that
water peaks and cerebral water content were higher in
MCAO-1 day, -3 day, -7 day groups than in the
sham-operated group (P<0.05), suggesting that cerebral
edema developed in the MCAO groups. The wet/dry
weight method yielded similar results. The results of
neurological scoring were consistent with the severity of
brain edema, and immunohistochemical examination
exhibited a large number of microglia in the ischemic
cortex.
MRI can directly display morphological changes in
cerebral architecture and is characterized by high resolution, excellent precision, non-invasiveness. Moreover,
MRS is capable of showing tissue metabolism and biochemical changes in vivo. 7.0Tesla MRI is superior to the
other equipment because of its improved signal/noise
ratio (SNR), increased chemical shift dispersion, reduced
slice thickness, shortened scanning time and smaller
voxel volume[7].
A major morphological change after MCAO is
cerebral edema. MRI can identify tiny moisture change
(3%–5%) in brain tissue. A previous study demonstrated
that T2 value began to prolong significantly 1 h after
ischemia[2]. Our study also showed that T2WI signal experienced obvious change in ischemic cortex 1–7 days
after brain ischemia and the signal arrived at a peak on
day 3, suggesting that MRI can help achieve early diagnosis of cerebral ischemic edema, and can observe the
variation dynamically. MRI is undoubtedly better than
wet/dry weight method and can dynmically monitor
cerebral ischemic edema.
Bederson’s scores, as behavioral measures for
MCAO, are associated with the severity of cerebral infarction and brain volume. In this study, the neurological
scores were significantly higher in MCAO groups than in
the sham operated group, suggesting that limb functions

in MCAO-treated animals were obviously impaired.
mI is often used as a sign of microglia cells, and the
increased mI value may be associated with abnormal
gliosis[8], and the crest of mI is located at 3.56 ppm. Our
MRS results showed mI/Cr ratio was increased in
MCAO group with obviosly OX-42 positive cells expressed in ischemic cortex. Our previous studies suggested that the inflammatory cells were microglia which
gathered in the ischemic cortex mainly after MCAO[9].
OX-42 is a specific markers of microglia. The activated microglia can synthesize and release interleukin
(IL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), chemotactic factors (CF) and other biological substances, and these cytokines also play important roles in chemotaxis of neutrophils, macrophages, T
cells and other inflammatory cells, thereby aggravating
inflammatory edema of the ischemic cortex[9].
The molecular mechanism of inflammatory edema
after cerebral ischemia remains unclear. Radiological
study in combination with immunofluorescence staining
can help us better understand the molecular-morphological mechanisms of inflammatory edema.
Many studies suggested that microglia might be implicated in the pathophysiological processes of inflammatory edema after MCAO. Matrix metalloproteinases-9
(MMP-9), derived from microglia, might be the molecules responsible for the damage to BBB[10]. The findings of this study demonstrated that non-invasive MRI
technology, with high spatial and tissue resolution, can
three-dimensionally evaluate the severity of brain edema
and is clinically helpful in the evaluation and treatment
of post-ischemia inflammatory edema.
