Abstract
Based on the outcome of a number of experimental studies,
progesterone (PROG) holds promise as a new therapy for
stroke. To understand more about the mechanisms involved,
we administered PROG (or the major metabolite, allopregnanolone, ALLO), intra-peritoneally, for a period of 24 h after
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion to male mice
variably expressing intracellular progesterone receptors (iPR)
A/B. Effects on infarct volume and neurogenesis were then
assessed up to 1 month later. Predictably, infarct volume in
wild-type mice receiving either drug was signiﬁcantly smaller.
However, mice heterozygous for iPRs A/B showed protection
by ALLO but not by PROG. There was robust ampliﬁcation of

Introduction
The annual costs of stroke will increase substantially over the
next 20 years, placing increased emphasis on prevention,
acute care and rehabilitation (Ovbiagele et al. 2013). Tissue
plasminogen activator can dissolve an obstructive clot and
restore blood ﬂow, but only a minority of stroke patients are
eligible for treatment and there is risk of hemorrhage.
Nothing has, as yet, followed tissue plasminogen activator
into the stroke clinic (Sena et al. 2007; Crossley et al. 2008).
Compared with men of the same age, pre-menopausal
women have a lower risk of stroke; however, the incidence of
stroke then increases rapidly, coincident with diminished
circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone (PROG)
(Appleros et al. 2009; Haast et al. 2012; Gibson 2013).
Experimental studies of our own and others suggest that
administration of PROG after focal cerebral ischemia in a
variety of species confers both anatomic and functional
beneﬁts (Gibson et al. 2008; Wong et al. 2013). While the

Bix 2013); interference with neurogenesis is reported to
negatively inﬂuence stroke outcome (Wang et al. 2012). In
our initial report of the beneﬁts of PROG after ischemic
stroke in mice, we showed that a course of administration
over the ﬁrst 24 h resulted in functional beneﬁts evident
many weeks later (Gibson and Murphy 2004). As PROG
(Zhang et al. 2010a,b) and one product of its metabolism,
allopregnanolone (ALLO) (Wang et al. 2008), are reported
to promote survival of newly born neurons, we administered
these drugs to wild-type and iPR-deﬁcient male mice after
transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion and
assessed effects on neurogenesis up to 1 month later.

Materials and methods
Primary antibodies: bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Novus, Littleton,
CO NB500-169, 1 : 500); DCX doublecortin (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA sc-8066, 1 : 250); NeuN neuronal
speciﬁc nuclear protein (Upstate, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA
ABN90, 1 : 250). Secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA): Cy3 anti-rat (1 : 250); DyLight
649 anti-goat (1 : 250); Alexa Fluor 647 anti-guinea pig (1 : 250).
DAPI (40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (1 : 50 000) was from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA and ALLO (AS04 041S) from Agrisera,
Vannas, Sweden. All routine chemicals, including PROG (P-0130),
ﬁnasteride (FIN, F1293), (2-Hydroxypropyl)-b-cyclodextrin
(H5784), and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, were from Sigma,
St Louis, MO, USA. The C57bl/6 mice were purchased from The
Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME.
Animals
The breeding colony was derived from male /PRlacz mice
provided by Baylor College of Medicine (Ismail et al. 2002).
Males were paired with C57bl/6 females and the offspring
genotyped by PCR. Heterozygote (PR+/) breeding pairs were
established so as to generate PR+/+, PR+/, and PR/ littermates.
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
Only male offspring were subject to MCAocclusion surgery (25–
32 g body weight, ~ 12 weeks of age) and genotype was identiﬁed
post-mortem to ensure randomization and blinding. Surgery was
performed as described in Jayadev et al. (2011) with approval from
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University
of Washington. Regional cerebral blood ﬂow was routinely
determined in all mice by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry through the
intact skull. Vehicle ((2-Hydroxypropyl)-b-cyclodextrin, ﬁnal 2% in
phosphate-buffered saline), PROG (8 mg/kg), or ALLO (10 mg/kg)
was administered i.p. immediately upon reperfusion, and again 6
and 24 h later. This regimen recapitulated our primary study
(Gibson and Murphy 2004). Groups of mice were killed 48 h after
MCAo, the brains cut into 2 mm sections, and slices incubated in
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (1 mg/mL saline) at 20° C for
30 min. Digital photographs were taken and infarct area was
calculated by at least two observers blinded to treatment, correcting
for edema.
The remaining mice were injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg, i.p.
twice each day, 8 h apart) on days 6 and 7 post-surgery, to coincide

33

with the peak neurogenic response following MCAo (Zhu et al.
2003; Luo et al. 2005). Some mice were killed by intra-cardiac
perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde on day 11 to monitor BrdU
incorporation, but the majority were maintained until day 28.
Excised brains were post-ﬁxed for 24 h and then placed in 30%
sucrose, which was changed three times. Trimmed brains were
mounted in optimal cutting temperature compound on dry ice and
stored at 20°C until sectioning by cryostat.
Immunohistochemistry
Coronal sections of brain (25 lm) were blocked and permeabilized
in 10% donkey serum/0.5% Triton-X for 60 min before addition of
primary antibody (overnight at 4°C). After a thorough wash in
phosphate-buffered saline, sections were exposed to secondary
antibodies overnight at 4°C. After further washing, slides were
incubated in DAPI for 10 min and cover-slipped in gelvatol. The
protocol for BrdU was that of Pan et al. (2012), which involved two
HCl steps and neutralization in sodium borate.
Imaging
Images were collected via a confocal microscope (FV-1000 Olympus, Center Valley, PA). The DAPI signal was excited with a
405 nm laser, Cy3 with a 561 nm solid state diode laser, and Alexa
647 with a Helium–Neon laser. Positive cells were recorded in a
randomly chosen ﬁeld (512 lm square), within the lateral cortex,
striatum, subventricular zone (SVZ), dentate gyrus (DG), and CA1,
in both ipsi- and contra-lateral brain, in one tissue section from each
of the eight slides selected at intervals through the brain (a 1 : 20
series). A total of 28 optical sections of 0.5 lm thickness were
collected in the z-axis from a single ﬁeld using a 209 objective lens
under ﬁxed gain, laser power, pinhole, and PMT settings. Images
were captured and presented to two or three observers, who counted
cells in a blinded fashion.
Statistical analysis
Data are summarized as mean  SE. Mean values were compared
by ANOVA or Student’s t-test, as appropriate. p-Values < 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
To determine whether metabolism was important for the
neuroprotective effects of PROG, one group was injected
with FIN (10 mg/kg, i.p.), an inhibitor of 5a-reductase.
Groups of wild-type C57bl/6 males were subject to 1 h of
MCAo followed by administration of PROG, FIN prior to
PROG, ALLO or vehicle. Compared with vehicle, the
average infarct volume of mice receiving PROG and ALLO
was signiﬁcantly smaller (37% and 65%, respectively). In the
group of six mice receiving FIN prior to PROG, the average
infarct volume was not signiﬁcantly different from either
vehicle or PROG-only mice; notably, there was increased
variability in the PROG/FIN group (Fig. 1).
To produce a more deﬁnitive answer regarding metabolism
in the neuroprotective effects of PROG, we assessed infarct
volume in mice genetically variable in iPR expression. We

focused on heterozygous males because these mice have
been shown to have reduced responsiveness to PROG (Liu
et al. 2012), and they were the largest constituency as
dictated by our breeding strategy. For these experiments, the
duration of MCA occlusion was reduced from 60 to 45 min,
in case loss of iPR removed endogenous neuroprotection and
risked animal survival. For comparison, we measured
average infarct volumes in +/+ and iPR/ mice 48-h after
MCAo and noted these were not signiﬁcantly different
(Fig. 2a), conﬁrming the ﬁndings of Liu et al. (2012). In
iPR+/ mice, the administration of PROG after MCA
occlusion no longer resulted in neuroprotection while the
beneﬁts of exogenous ALLO were unaffected (Fig. 2b).
Post-surgical survival of mice was unaffected by treatment.
Newly born cells (BrdU+), and immature (DCX+), and
mature (NeuN+) neurons were identiﬁed at various times
post-stroke, by indirect immunoﬂuorescence using speciﬁc
probes, in various brain regions of mice +/+ and / for iPR
(Fig. 3a and b). In mice that had been pulse-labeled with
BrdU on days 6/7 after MCAo we noted, on day 11 (six
mice), very large increases in the number of BrdU+ cells in
the lateral cortex and striatum on the injured, as compared to

(a)

the contralateral side (> 100 : 1). There were large numbers
of DCX+ (> 100), BrdU+ (50–100) and double-labeled cells
(> 100) in the SVZ (many fewer in the DG) on day 11, but
few DCX+ cells (< 50) had migrated from the SVZ into the
lateral cortex or striatum.
A considerable proportion of the BrdU+ cells seen on day
11 persisted until day 28 (six mice), particularly in the
striatum (~ 80%) but less so in the lateral cortex (< 50%),
and BrdU+ cells remained scattered throughout the SVZ and
DG. None of the BrdU+ cells in the injured striatum and
lateral cortex was positive for DCX+ and the co-expression
of BrdU and NeuN+ was extremely rare. Acute treatment
with PROG or ALLO has been reported to suppress poststroke inﬂammation and to promote neurogenesis in vitro.
However, we found that neither drug enhanced neurogenesis
at 28 days post-stroke; the only signiﬁcant effect we noted
was a 50% reduction in the number of BrdU+ cells remaining
in the striatum of mice (iPR +/+ and /) that had PROG
administered (VEHICLE: 190  29 vs. PROG: 100  13,
n = 6 and 7; p < 0.02). This was not seen in mice receiving
ALLO (201  29, n = 7).

Discussion
Both PROG and ALLO are neuroprotective when administered acutely in animal models of acute brain injury, resulting
in the presumption that the effects of PROG are secondary to
its metabolism by Type II steroid 5a-reductase in the brain
(Mahendroo et al. 1996). Despite our equivocal ﬁndings in
wild-type mice with a 5a-reductase inhibitor (FIN), the
deﬁnitive outcomes we see in iPR+/ mice conﬁrm the recent
proposal (Liu et al. 2012) that PROG and ALLO achieve
neuroprotection through different signaling pathways. The
potential mechanisms involved have been exhaustively
reviewed (Hosie et al. 2006; Schumacher et al. 2007,
2008). One interpretation regarding the effects of PROG is
that established neurons are more likely to survive cerebral
ischemia because the inﬂammatory response (elevated interleukin-1b, tumor necrosis factor a, inducible nitric oxide

synthase) is heavily suppressed by the drug (Grossman et al.
2004; Gibson et al. 2005). As GABAA receptors are
important in stroke recovery (Clarkson et al. 2010), and
ALLO is well known to modulate these receptors (Hosie
et al. 2006; Knight et al. 2012), this could represent an
additional mechanism.
Ampliﬁcation of neurogenesis after stroke is well-documented, both in rodent and in human brain (Lledo et al.
2006; Macas et al. 2006; Murphy and Corbett 2009).
Though the functional signiﬁcance and roles of these newly
born cells are very far from clear, the time scale of this
phenomenon correlates with the recovery of function from
stroke. Furthermore, conditional depletion of DCX-immunopositive cells, indicative of immature neurons, has been
reported to inhibit long-term recovery in mice (Wang et al.
2012). These new cells arise in the two persisting germinal
regions of the brain, DG and SVZ, and the latter migrate to
subcortical and (to a lesser extent) cortical structures.
In mice injected with BrdU 1 week after MCAo we
observed, a few days later, very large increases in the number
of BrdU+ cells in the lateral cortex and striatum on the
injured, as compared to the contralateral side. While there
were large numbers of DCX+ and DCX+/BrdU+ cells in the
SVZ (fewer in the DG) at 11 days after stroke, few had
migrated out into the surrounding tissue. A signiﬁcant
proportion of this population of newborn cells persisted,
particularly in the striatum. Even after 4 weeks, we found
numerous BrdU+ cells still in the striatum (fewer in the
lateral cortex) ipsilateral to injury, but BrdU+ cells
co-expressing either DCX or NeuN were extremely rare!
The absence of newborn neurons in this study is notable, but
it is worth remembering that we could trace only the fate of
those cells born on days 6 and 7 post-injury.
The efﬁciency of the neurogenic response following
stroke is very limited, presumably because the attendant

(b)

inﬂammation is highly detrimental (Doeppner et al. 2009;
Tobin et al. 2014). Even though acute treatment with either
PROG or ALLO is known to suppress post-stroke inﬂammation, we found that neither drug enhanced proliferation
or migration. Indeed, at 4 weeks after stroke the only
discernible difference in brain histology was a 50%
reduction in the number of BrdU-positive cells remaining
in the striatum of mice (both +/+ and /) that had received
PROG (but not ALLO). Zhang et al. (2010a) found that
PROG promoted survival of newborn DG neurons and,
when administered post-stroke, suppressed proliferation but
enhanced migration and improved survival of new neurons
(Zhang et al. 2010b). Both PROG and ALLO are reported
to promote neural progenitor proliferation in vitro (Wang
et al. 2005) and ALLO can reverse deﬁcits in neurogenesis
in DG of a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (Wang
et al., 2010).
Post-stroke, even though cell proliferation is ampliﬁed in
the ipsilateral SVZ and there is migration into the striatum
and lateral cortex, it seems that these newborn cells are not
destined to become (or to survive as) neurons. While it is
possible that a subpopulation of BrdU+ cells derives from
bone marrow rather than SVZ, and inﬁltrates on the
ipsilateral side through a leaky blood–brain barrier, the
massive extent of proliferation we observe in the SVZ on day
11 could easily account for the number of persisting BrdU+
cells on day 28. Do these surviving newborn cells have
biological signiﬁcance? Presumably, they could represent a
source of neurotrophic factors and so participate in dynamic
tissue remodeling. However, as neither PROG nor ALLO
ampliﬁed proliferation or the migration of newly born cells
we conclude that neurogenesis does not contribute to the
long-term beneﬁts of drug administration.
