Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a promising candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
However, accumulating evidence demonstrated that VEGF could exacerbate blood–brain barrier (BBB)
disruption after ischemic stroke. This study was designed to investigate the underlying mechanisms. In
the present study, a transient (90 min) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was performed to
induce ischemic stroke in mice. VEGF was administered intracerebroventricularly 3 h after reperfusion.
A gene expression microarray was utilized to investigate the differentially expressed genes among the
sham, MCAO, and VEGF groups. A total of 3381 mRNAs were signiﬁcantly altered by cerebral ischemia
when compared with the sham group, and 15 of them were changed in the VEGF group when compared
with the MCAO group. Among the 15 genes, orosomucoid (Orm) 1 was most sharply changed, and this
gene has previously been reported to maintain the permeability of microvessels and integrity of the
BBB. Results of the microarray showed that the expression of Orm1 increased after cerebral ischemia,
whereas it decreased in response to VEGF, which was conﬁrmed by real-time quantitative PCR, western
blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunoﬂuorescence. The bioinformatics analysis indicated two
NF-␬B binding sites on the Orm1 promoter, and a super-shift assay veriﬁed that NF-␬B could bind the
Orm1 promoter. Results of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that VEGF inhibited
the DNA-binding activity of NF-␬B/p65. Furthermore, the elevated expression and activation of key members in the canonical NF-␬B pathway induced by cerebral ischemia were also inhibited by VEGF treatment.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that decreasing the Orm1 expression via inhibition of the NF-␬B
pathway could be a possible mechanism involved in the aggravation of BBB disruption after stroke by
VEGF.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), initially discovered
as an angiogenic and vascular permeability factor (Senger et al.,
1983), has been recognized to participate in neuroprotection, neurogenesis, anti-inﬂammatory processes, neurite outgrowth, and
ischemic brain remodeling (Greenberg and Jin, 2013). Therefore,
VEGF is a potential pharmaceutical target for treating ischemic
stroke. In fact, VEGF gene therapy for peripheral artery disease
and coronary artery disease has shown the ability to generate new
collateral vessels and achieved signiﬁcantly improved perfusion
and functional improvement in several clinical trials (Giacca and
Zacchigna, 2012). However, accumulating evidence from both basic
and preclinical trials demonstrated that the risk-to-beneﬁt ratio
of the application of VEGF for ischemic stroke was high (Li et al.,

L. Wu et al. / Brain Research Bulletin 109 (2014) 88–98

2008; Manoonkitiwongsa, 2011). This ﬁnding may likely be due to
the severe side effects of VEGF treatment, such as blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, brain edema and hemorrhagic transformation
(Chi et al., 2007; Kanazawa et al., 2011; Kimura et al., 2005; Koyama
et al., 2010; Li et al., 2008; Valable et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2000).
BBB, a vital element of the neurovascular unit, plays an important
role in the maintenance of central nervous system homeostasis
(Hawkins and Davis, 2005). When BBB is disrupted by ischemic
stroke, many serum ions, proteins, and even cells that are deleterious to the nervous system enter the brain and further worsen
ischemic injury. Preventing BBB disruption and brain edema associated with VEGF administration might contribute to improve the
effect of treatment and lower the risk-to-beneﬁt ratio. To abolish
its detrimental effects on the BBB and brain edema after ischemic
stroke, the underlying mechanisms must be completely clariﬁed.
Due to the progress of microarray technology, the full view of
gene expression changes in distinguished circumstances can be
described. The present study was designed to investigate the genes
inﬂuenced by VEGF in ischemic brain and determine the possible
genes related to BBB disruption after VEGF administration.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animal preparation
Adult male C57BL/6 mice weighing 23–25 g (7–8 W) were provided by the Model Animal Research Institute of Nanjing University
(Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). The mice were housed in the same environment with 12 h light/dark cycles and a relative humidity of
65%. The room temperature was maintained at approximately 25 ◦ C
by air conditioning throughout all experiments. All animals were
fasted overnight but were allowed free access to water before the
surgery.
All experiments were carried out strictly according to the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of the National Institute of Health (NIH Publications No.
80–23, revised 1996). All protocols were approved by the animal
subjects review board of Jinling Hospital. All surgeries were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia, and all efforts were
made to minimize the number of mice used and their suffering.
2.2. Experimental groups
A total of 198 mice were used in this study. Fifty-four mice were
randomized into the sham group, which underwent sham middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery, while the other 144
received 90 min of MCAO; 24 of them failed, and the remaining 120
mice were randomized into two groups: the MCAO group (n = 60)
which received 1 ␮l phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.01 M, pH
7.4) intracerebroventricularly in the right lateral ventricle 3 h after
reperfusion, and the VEGF group (n = 60), in which 1 ␮l rhVEGFA165 (10 ␮g/ml, dissolved in 0.01 M PBS) was injected into the right
lateral ventricle 3 h after reperfusion.
2.3. Transient focal ischemia and drug delivery
As demonstrated previously (Wu et al., 2014), the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was blocked by a silicone-coated 6–0 nylon
monoﬁlament. A laser Doppler ﬂowmeter (LDF; Perimed PF5000,
Stockholm, Sweden) was used to conﬁrm that the blood ﬂow of
the MCA territory decreased by at least 75% of the baseline. After
90 min, the ﬁlament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. The rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ◦ C using a rectal probe and a
heating pad during the surgery, and it was maintained at >35 ◦ C for
24 h after ischemia onset via an incubator (The Guohua Instruments

89

Corp, Changzhou, China). The physiological parameters were monitored before and during ischemia. Failed models were excluded
from the analysis.
Three hours after 90 min MCAO, the mice were re-anesthetized
with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg i.p., Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) and placed in a stereotaxic frame (Model 900, David
Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA). The stereotaxic injections
were conducted via Hamilton syringe using the following coordinates: 0.8 mm rostral to bregma, 1.6 mm lateral to midline, and
3.5 mm ventral to the skull surface. Animals in the MCAO group
received 1 ␮l phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.01 M, pH 7.4); mice
in the VEGF group were given 1 ␮l recombinant human VEGF-A165
(10 ␮g/ml, dissolved in 0.01 M PBS). At the end of the injection, the
needle was left in place for 5 min before being slowly withdrawn.

2.4. Behavioral tests
In all mice, a battery of behavioral tests (the accelerated rotarod
test, modiﬁed Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS), and the adhesive removal test) (Wu et al., 2014) was performed 24 h and 7 days
after MCAO by two coworkers who were blinded to the experimental design.
The accelerated rotarod test was used to assess motor coordination and balance changes after brain ischemia. The results were
presented as the percentage of mean duration on the rotarod compared with the internal baseline. mNSS is a functional test used to
assess motor, sensory, reﬂex and balance deﬁcits (Chen et al., 2001).
The score was graded on a scale of 0–18 (normal score, 0; maximal
deﬁcit score, 18). Mild injury is indicated by a score of 1–6, moderate injury 7–12, and severe injury 13–18.The adhesive removal test
was performed to evaluate somatosensory deﬁcits after MCAO. The
times to perceive and remove the adhesive tapes on each forepaw
were recorded.

2.5. Evaluation of brain water content
The brain water content was measured as previously described
(Kim et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, at 6 h and 24 h post-reperfusion, the
brains (n = 6 in each group) were removed, and the hemispheres
were immediately separated. Tissue samples were weighed on an
electronic analytical balance (APX-60, Denver Instrument, Denver,
CO, USA) to obtain the wet weight (WW) and then dried at 110 ◦ C
for 24 h to determine the dry weight (DW). Difference between the
wet and dry weights was taken as the brain water content.

2.6. Determination of BBB leakage
Six hours and 24 h after reperfusion, 4 ml/kg of 2% Evans blue
(Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in normal saline was
injected into the caudal veins of mice. Sixty minutes later, the mice
(n = 6) were deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection
of 70 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium and transcardially perfused with
0.01 M PBS until colorless perfusion ﬂuid was observed from the
right atrium. After decapitation, the brains were removed from the
skull, and the hemispheres were separated. Tissue samples were
washed twice in PBS, blotted dry, weighed, homogenized in 1500 ␮l
formamide (Sigma–Aldrich), and incubated for 24 h at 55 ◦ C. The
homogenates were then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 45 min. The
supernatants were used to measure the absorbance of Evans blue at
620 nm with a spectrophotometer (EPOCH, Biotek Instrument Inc.,
Winooski, VT, USA). The Evans blue contents were quantiﬁed based
on a linear standard curve derived from known amounts of the dye
and expressed as micrograms per gram of brain tissues.

2.7. Evaluation of infarct volume
Mice in the MCAO group and VEGF group (n = 6) were sacriﬁced
24 h and 7 days after reperfusion. The brains were quickly removed
and coronally sectioned into 1-mm-thick slices; these slices were
then incubated in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC,
Sigma–Aldrich) at 37 ◦ C for approximately 20 min and ﬁxed by
immersion in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution. The infarct volume
was calculated via Swanson’s method and expressed as the percentage of the contralateral hemisphere volume. Two researchers
blinded to this study design measured the infarct area of each slice
using Image J (NIH, USA).

PrimeScriptTM RT reagent Kit (perfect real time) (TaKaRa Bio Inc.,
Otsu, Shiga, Japan). The qRT-PCR analysis was performed using the
Mx3000P qPCR System (Agilent Technologies) with SYBR® Premix
Ex TaqTM II (perfect real time) (TaKaRa). The primers used for qRTPCR are shown in Table 1. The qRT-PCR reactions were performed
in three duplicates for each sample. The relative quantiﬁcation of
mRNA expression was determined using the 2−Ct method. Differences among groups were compared using analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by post hoc t-test with the SPSS software (version 17.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). A P-value < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

2.8. Microarray and data processing
An Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA) was used to assess the RNA integrity of each sample (24 h
post-reperfusion). SurePrint G3 Mouse Gene Expression 8 × 60 K
Microarray was used and run by the service provider. The array contains the whole mouse transcript (39,430 protein-coding genes).
These genes were collected from the most authoritative databases,
such as RefSeq, Ensembl, Unigene, GenBank, and RIKEN. Positive
probes for housekeeping genes and negative control probes (i.e.
scramble sequences) were also printed onto the array for hybridization quality control.
The Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 10.7.1.1, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to analyze the
acquired array images. Quantile normalization and subsequent
data processing were performed using the GeneSpring GX software package (version 12.0, Agilent Technologies). Differentially
expressed mRNAs with statistical signiﬁcance among groups were
determined based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post
hoc t-test P < 0.05 and fold change >2.
2.9. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)
The total RNA was extracted by homogenizing samples (periinfarct area, n = 6) in TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen, Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
RNA quantity was measured with Micro-Volume Spectrophotometer System (EPOCH, Biotek Instrument Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Five
micrograms of total RNA were used to synthesize cDNA via the

2.10. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and super-shift
assay
A double-stranded DNA probe containing part of the orosomucoid (Orm) 1 gene promoter (5 -CAC GGC AGG GGG CTC TCA GGA
C-3 ) or NF-␬B consensus oligonucleotide (5 -AGT TGA GGG GAC
TTT CCC AGG C-3 ) was labeled with biotinylated 3 -ends. The Orm1
probe containing oligonucleotides from the Orm1 gene promoter
was used to perform a super-shift assay to examine whether NF␬B could bind the Orm1 promoter. The NF-␬B probe containing
NF-␬B consensus oligonucleotides was used in EMSA to detect the
DNA-binding activity of NF-␬B. Nuclear extracts were isolated from
the peri-infarct tissue (n = 6) using NE-PER® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Recombinant
mouse NF-␬B/p65 was purchased from Sigma–Aldrich. The binding reactions were carried out for 20 min at room temperature
in the presence of 50 ng/␮l poly (dI–dC) in 1×binding buffer
(LightShift® Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit, Pierce) using 20 fmol
of biotin-labeled target DNA and 5 ␮g of nuclear extract. Unlabeled target DNA (4 pmol) or 5 ␮g of anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) was added per 20 ␮l of binding reaction where indicated. Electrophoresis was performed in a
6.5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE buffer at 150 V for
40 min. The gel was then incubated in 0.5 × TBE buffer for 10 min
at room temperature and ﬁnally transferred to a positively charged
nylon membrane (Pierce). The nylon membrane was cross-linked
at 302 nm for 15 min. The signals were visualized using the Light
Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce).

2.11. Antibodies and western blotting analysis
The antibodies for western blotting included the following:
rabbit anti-IKK␣ polyclonal antibody, rabbit anti-IKK␤ polyclonal antibody, rabbit anti-phospho-IKK␣/␤ monoclonal antibody,
mouse anti-I␬B␣ monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-phospho-I␬B␣
monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-NF-␬B p65 monoclonal antibody, rabbit anti-phospho-NF-␬B p65 monoclonal antibody, rabbit
anti-␤-actin monoclonal antibody, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated anti-mouse IgG, and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA,
USA). Sheep anti-orosomucoid1 polyclonal antibody was purchased from R&D System (R&D System, USA). HRP-conjugated
rabbit anti-sheep IgG was purchased from Abcam company
(Cambridge, UK).
Protein lysate was extracted from the peri-infarct area (n = 6).
Equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto the SDS-PAGE gels.
After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes, which were subsequently
blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin and 3% nonfat milk
dissolved in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) solution
and incubated in the antibodies of the following proteins: IKK␣
(1:1000), IKK␤ (1:1000), phospho-IKK␣/␤ (1:1000), I␬B␣ (1:1000),
phospho-I␬B␣ (1:1000), p65 (1:1000), phospho-p65 (1:1000),
Orm1 (1:200), or ␤-actin (1:3000). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Merck
Millipore, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) were used for detection. Each sample was detected in three duplicates. The relative
protein expression levels were quantiﬁed using the Quantity One
software 4.6.2 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) based on the ﬂuorescence intensity andnormalized to ␤-actin, which was used as a
loading control.

Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc., 1:200 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h.
The sections were then coverslipped with a ﬂuorescent mounting
medium (CC/Mount, Sigma–Aldrich) and viewed under a Confocal
microscope (Fluoview, FV1Oi, Olympus Corporation).
2.13. Cell counting
Two coworkers blinded to the experimental design counted
the cells. The immunohistochemistry- and immunoﬂuoresencepositive cells in the peri-infarct area were counted. Five slides
obtained at −1 mm, 0, 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm from the bregma were
used for cell counting in each mouse (n = 6). Six random areas of
each slide were involved, and the average numbers of positive
cells/mm2 were calculated using the Image-Pro Plus software 6.0
(Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA).
2.14. Statistical analysis
Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software (version
17.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The differences among groups were
analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by StudentNeuman–Keul post hoc tests, and differences between two groups
were analyzed using t-test. Statistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as
P < 0.05. Histograms were constructed with the Graphpad Prism 5
Project (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

3.1. VEGF aggravated BBB leakage and brain edema after cerebral
ischemia

2.12. Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
Immunohistochemistry was carried out on 10-␮m thick sections of brain tissues (n = 6). After ﬁxation in acetone, the sections
were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous
peroxidase. Non-speciﬁc binding was blocked with normal rabbit serum (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature, and the sections
were then incubated with sheep anti-orosomucoid1 polyclonal
antibody (R&D System, Minneapolis, MN, USA, 1:100 dilution)
overnight at 4 ◦ C. After rinsing in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4) three times,
the sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated rabbit antisheep IgG at room temperature for 30 min. Thereafter, they were
stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride for 5 min,
and the nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin for 1 min
and then mounted with neutral balsam (Specimen Model Factory,
Shanghai, China). Negative controls were prepared by omitting
the primary antibodies. The images were screened using inverted
microscopes (Olympus IX71, Olympus BX51, Olympus Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan).
For the immunoﬂuorescence staining, the sections (n = 6) were
removed from −80 ◦ C storage, equilibrated to room temperature,
and ﬁxed in 95% alcohol. They were then blocked with normal rabbit serum (Pierce) or normal donkey serum (APPLYGEN) for 1 h at
room temperature and incubated with sheep anti-orosomucoid1
polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution) and rabbit anti-␤3-tubulin
monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA,
USA, 1:200 dilution) or mouse anti-GFAP monoclonal antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., 1:300 dilution) overnight at 4 ◦ C.
Negative controls were prepared by omitting the primary antibodies. After three times washing, the sections were incubated in
Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG (H + L) (Jackson
Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA, 1:200
dilution) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG

The Evans blue extravasation in ischemic hemisphere was measured to evaluate the BBB leakage. Representative photos that
demonstrate the Evans blue extravasation at 24 h after reperfusion
in three groups are shown in Fig. 1. At 6 h after reperfusion, the
Evans blue content signiﬁcantly increased in the MCAO group
(1.38 ± 0.14 ␮g/g, P < 0.05, n = 6) compared with the sham group
(0.71 ± 0.07 ␮g/g tissue). This trend was enhanced by VEGF treatment (1.83 ± 0.12 ␮g/g versus 1.38 ± 0.14 ␮g/g, P < 0.05, n = 6). At
24 h post reperfusion, the Evans blue content was also signiﬁcantly higher in the VEGF group than MCAO group (sham group:
0.67 ± 0.07 ␮g/g; MCAO group: 1.96 ± 0.29 ␮g/g; VEGF group:
2.78 ± 0.18 ␮g/g tissue, P < 0.05, n = 6).
As shown in Fig. 1c, in consistent with the results obtained for
Evans blue extravasation, VEGF further increased brain edema in
the ischemic hemisphere compared with the MCAO group at 6 h
after reperfusion (sham group: 108.22 ± 2.98 mg; MCAO group:
117.94 ± 2.43 mg; VEGF group: 126.63 ± 3.69 mg; P < 0.05, n = 6)
and 24 h post reperfusion (sham group: 111.33 ± 4.40 mg; MCAO
group: 120.97 ± 3.51 mg; VEGF group: 134.00 ± 5.47 mg; P < 0.05,
n = 6).
3.2. Delayed improvements of stroke outcomes by VEGF in mouse
MCAO model
We measured the infarct volume using TTC staining, and the
neurologic outcomes were tested using three behavioral tests at
24 h and 7 days after reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after ischemia,
the infarct volume did not signiﬁcantly decrease after VEGF administration (54.50 ± 7.30% in VEGF group versus 52.59 ± 8.08% in
MCAO group, P > 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 2a). The accelerated rotarod
test (12.50 ± 3.39% versus 9.80 ± 2.20%, P > 0.05, n = 12) and mNSS
(10.53 ± 2.88 versus 10.64 ± 2.37, P > 0.05, n = 12) did not markedly

Fig. 1. VEGF aggravated blood–brain barrier leakage and brain edema after cerebral ischemia. (a, b) The images and histogram showed that Evans blue extravasation in the
ischemic hemisphere increased after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and VEGF administration further aggravated the increase of Evans blue leakage after cerebral
ischemia at 6 h and 24 h after reperfusion. (c) Water contents in the ischemic hemisphere were further increased by VEGF treatment at 6 h and 24 h after reperfusion. *P < 0.05

differ between the two groups. However, in VEGF group, the reﬂex
test (one test included in mNSS) was signiﬁcantly improved compared to the MCAO group (1.93 ± 0.70 versus 1.21 ± 0.43, P < 0.05,
n = 12). In the adhesive test, time to remove the left adhesive
tapes was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05, n = 12) extended in the VEGF group
(54.60 ± 18.16 s) compared to the MCAO group (46.36 ± 8.40 s).
Seven days after stroke, the infarct volume signiﬁcantly
decreased in VEGF group compared with MCAO group
(22.95 ± 4.70% versus 33.76 ± 4.84%, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 2a).
The accelerated rotarod test (56.67 ± 2.34% in VEGF group versus
42.83 ± 4.79% in MCAO group, P < 0.05, n = 6) and mNSS (2.83 ± 1.47
in VEGF group versus 5.50 ± 1.87 in MCAO group, P < 0.05, n = 6)
markedly differed between the two groups. In the adhesive test,
time to perceive the left adhesive tapes was signiﬁcantly decreased
in the VEGF group compared to the MCAO group (5.12 ± 2.37 s in
VEGF group versus 9.33 ± 2.50 in MCAO group, P < 0.05, n = 6). The
results of the behavioral tests are shown in Fig. 2b.
3.3. Differentially expressed genes detected via microarray
Transient focal cerebral ischemia signiﬁcantly changed 3381
mRNAs (2340 up-regulated by 2-fold and 1041 down-regulated
by 0.5-fold) compared with the sham group. Intracerebroventricular VEGF further impacted the mRNA expression proﬁle in the
ischemic brain. Compared to the MCAO group, 38 mRNAs significantly changed (19 up-regulated by 2-fold and 19 down-regulated
by 0.5-fold). Fifteen of these 38 mRNAs were also differentially
expressed in the MCAO group when compared with the sham
group. Fig. 3 shows the cluster analysis of these 15 mRNAs and
results of the qRT-PCR veriﬁcation. The expression of only one
gene, Nanagouti, tested by qRT-PCR was inconsistent with results
of the microarray. The gene ontology (GO) function annotations
of the 15 genes include the cell differentiation, regulation of
the immune system process, acute phase response, complement
activation, phagocytosis, protein homo-oligomerization, protein
de-ubiquitination, glucuronosyltransferase activity, generation of
precursor metabolites and energy, hormone-mediated signaling
pathway, genetic imprinting, melanocortin receptor binding, MAP
kinase kinase kinase activity, etc. As the most sharply changed
genes among these 15 genes, three members of Orm were previously reported to be associated with the permeability of the BBB
and stroke outcomes.
3.4. VEGF decreased Orm1 expression
On the mRNA level, Orm1 increased after MCAO (167.51 ± 10.62
versus 5.33 ± 0.94, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 3b) and declined after VEGF
administration (5.92 ± 1.09 versus 167.51 ± 10.62, P < 0.05, n = 6,

Fig. 3b). On the protein level, at 6 h post reperfusion, Orm1
was signiﬁcantly increased in the MCAO group compared to the
sham group (3.25 ± 0.26 versus 1.00 ± 0.18, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 4b),
and VEGF signiﬁcantly decreased Orm1 expression compared
with the MCAO group (1.55 ± 0.37 versus 3.25 ± 0.26, P < 0.05,
n = 6, Fig. 4b). At 24 h after reperfusion, Orm1 was increased
6.45-fold in the MCAO group compared to the sham group
(7.45 ± 0.77 versus 1.00 ± 0.32, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 4b), and decreased
in VEGF group compared with the MCAO group (2.23 ± 0.30 versus
7.45 ± 0.77, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the number of
Orm1-positive cells detected by immunohistochemistry increased
in the MCAO group compared to the sham group (515.17 ± 24.92
versus 60.75 ± 8.35, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 4a) and decreased in
the VEGF group compared to the MCAO group (178.83 ± 15.15
versus 515.17 ± 24.92, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 4a). The numbers of
Orm1/GFAP-positive astrocytes detected by immunoﬂuorescence
were consistently increased after MCAO (129.17 ± 11.18 in MCAO
group versus 25.33 ± 7.10 in sham group, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 4c)
and reduced after VEGF administration (65.17 ± 9.32 in VEGF group
versus 129.17 ± 11.18 in MCAO group, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 4c). The
number of Orm1/␤3-tubulin-positive neurons was signiﬁcantly
higher in the MCAO group than in the sham group (366.83 ± 18.23
versus 29.50 ± 4.03, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 4d) and signiﬁcantly lower
in the VEGF group than in the MCAO group (101.67 ± 13.16 versus
366.83 ± 18.23, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 4d).

3.5. NF-B could bind Orm1 promoter
The bioinformatics analysis identiﬁed two NF-␬B binding sites
on the Orm1 promoter. A super-shift assay was performed to investigate whether NF-␬B could bind the Orm1 promoter. As shown in
Fig. 5a, the incubation of NF-␬B/p65 protein with the labeled Orm1
probe produced a speciﬁc DNA–protein complex band that could be
completely eliminated by the unlabeled Orm1 probe. Additionally,
the complex was super-shifted in the presence of the NF-␬B/p65
antibody, and the intensity of the original band was reduced. Taken
together, results of the super-shift assay conﬁrmed that NF-␬B
could bind the promoter of Orm1.

3.6. VEGF inhibited DNA-binding activity of NF-B
The DNA-binding activity of NF-␬B/p65 was measured by EMSA.
Cerebral ischemia increased the DNA-binding activity of NF-␬B
compared with the sham group (1.00 ± 0.29 versus 3.15 ± 0.26,
P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 5b). However, the increased DNA-binding activity induced by ischemia was inhibited by VEGF administration
(3.15 ± 0.26 versus 0.95 ± 0.21, P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 5b).

3.7. VEGF inhibiting NF-B pathway

4. Discussion and conclusions

To investigate whether VEGF administration led to the inhibition of NF-␬B pathway, the expression of key members in the
canonical NF-␬B pathway were measured by both qRT-PCR and
western blotting. On the mRNA level, IKK␣, IKK␤, I␬B␣ and p65 all
increased (P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 6a) after MCAO, while this improvement was reversed (P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 6a) by VEGF administration.
On the protein level, the total and phosphorylated IKK␣, IKK␤, I␬B␣
and p65 were also elevated (P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 6b) after cerebral
ischemia, while their expressions were signiﬁcantly inhibited by
VEGF (P < 0.05, n = 6, Fig. 6b).

In the present study, we demonstrated that early delivery of
VEGF into the ischemic brain exacerbated BBB disruption and
brain edema. One of the possible mechanisms might be that VEGF
decreased Orm1 expression by inhibiting the activation of NF-␬B
pathway.
Immediately increased endogenous VEGF after cerebral
ischemia could promote angiogenesis, which correlates with
longer survival and better outcomes (Greenberg and Jin, 2013).
However, while exerting neuroprotective effect and improving
angiogenesis, neurogenesis and neurite outgrowth, exogenous

super-shift assay were performed using recombinant mouse NF-␬B/p65, a biotin-labeled DNA probe (containing part nucleotides of Orm1 promoter), unlabeled DNA probes

administration. *P < 0.05 versus the sham group, # P < 0.05 versus the MCAO group.

VEGF simultaneously exacerbated BBB disruption and brain edema
after ischemic stroke (Valable et al., 2005). Zhang et al. (2000) ﬁrst
reported the dual roles of VEGF in the enhancement of cerebral
microvascular perfusion and increase in the BBB leakage in the
ischemic brain. This paradoxical role of VEGF in ischemic stroke
was veriﬁed by several other studies (Chi et al., 2007; Kimura et al.,
2005; Koyama et al., 2010; Li et al., 2008; Valable et al., 2005;
Zhang et al., 2000). Consistent with these ﬁndings, our study also
found that VEGF increased BBB disruption and brain edema, as
evidenced by Evans blue extravasation and the brain water content
measurements, respectively.
Moreover, signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume and improved
neurological functions were not observed in VEGF-treated mice
at 24 h after stroke. This effect may be due to the detrimental
effects on the BBB overwhelming the beneﬁts of neuroprotection
and angiogenesis (Valable et al., 2005). Alternatively, VEGF might

not only increased BBB permeability but also aggravated secondary
ischemic insult at the acute stage of stroke (Li et al., 2008). However,
compared to the MCAO group, VEGF improved the neurological
deﬁcits and decreased infarct volume at 7 days after stroke. This
long term beneﬁcial effects on ischemic stroke could be due to
the angiogenesis, neurogenesis, axonal guidance and outgrowth
induced by VEGF.
We subsequently performed a gene expression microarray
to investigate the genes that are inﬂuenced by VEGF administration in the ischemic brain and attempted to identify genes
involved in BBB permeability from these differentially expressed
genes. The results of microarray revealed that, compared to the
MCAO group, 38 mRNAs signiﬁcantly changed, out of which 15
mRNAs were also differentially expressed in the MCAO group
when compared with the sham group. The 15 genes were listed
as follows: C3, Orm3, Gm7480, Otud7b, Orm1, Orm2, Scube3, Nhs,

Gm9853, Map3k10, Ccdc36, B3gat2, Plxnc1, nonagouti and Prr7.
Gene ontology (GO) function annotations of them include the cell
differentiation, regulation of the immune system process, acute
phase response, complement activation, phagocytosis, protein
homo-oligomerization, protein de-ubiquitination, glucuronosyltransferase activity, generation of precursor metabolites and
energy, hormone-mediated signaling pathway, genetic imprinting,
melanocortin receptor binding, MAP kinase kinase kinase activity,
etc. One of the mRNAs up-regulated by VEGF, Plxnc1, was involved
in cell proliferation, axonal guidance, neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity, which were all demonstrated as the effects of VEGF
on neurons after hypoxic or ischemic insult in previous studies
(Dragoni et al., 2011; Herz et al., 2012; Reitmeir et al., 2012; Sondell
et al., 2000). Accordingly, the Plxnc1 could be involved in some
possible pathway that might lead to enhance the beneﬁt of VEGF
treatment – better outcomes in the delayed time after stroke in this
study. However, there has been no previous research investigating
the interactions of VEGF and Plxnc1. It is necessary to perform further researches to elucidate the possible pathways or mechanisms
between VEGF and Plxnc1.
Out of the 15 differentially expressed genes, the three members
of Orm (Orm1, Orm2, Orm3) were the only genes conﬁrmed to be
related to the integrity and functions of BBB in previous studies.
Orm (orosomucoid, also known as alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, AGP)
is one of the major acute phase and inﬂammation-sensitive proteins (Fournier et al., 2000; Huang and Ung, 2013). Orm has been
identiﬁed as essential for the maintenance of stable solute permeability of microvessels by modulating the charge of microvessel
walls (Schnitzer and Pinney, 1992). While the Orm modulated
the permeability of BBB to charged molecules by adding negative
charges to the matrix components of BBB (Yuan et al., 2010), it also
increased the expression of tight junction proteins, such as occludin
and zonula occludens to enhance BBB integrity (Zhang and Mark,
2012). One study demonstrated that exogenously administered
Orm could mitigate brain edema and improve stroke outcomes
(Muchitsch and Schwarz, 2003). Therefore, the effects of VEGF on
BBB leakage and brain edema might be partly due to the reduction
of the Orm.
We subsequently explored how VEGF could regulate the expression of Orm. The bioinformatics analysis identiﬁed binding sites of
several transcription factors, such as acute protein-1, acute protein2, NF-␬B, on the promoter of Orm1 (the main expressed isoform
of Orm). Two previous studies indicated that NF-␬B regulated
the expression of the Orm gene in an AGP/EBP-binding-motifdependent manner (Lee et al., 1996; Shen et al., 1997). Additionally,
in the Lewis rat adjuvant model, WAY-169916, which selectively
inhibits NF-␬B transcriptional activity, markedly suppressed the
adjuvant induction of Orm (Keith et al., 2005). Therefore, we
veriﬁed whether NF-␬B was one of the transcription factors responsible for the Orm1 expression induced by cerebral ischemia and
decreased by VEGF. Results of the antibody super-shift assay conﬁrmed that NF-␬B could bind the Orm1 promoter.
Since VEGF inhibited the Orm1 expression and NF-␬B regulated the expression of Orm1, we further detected whether VEGF
inﬂuenced Orm1 expression via the NF-␬B pathway. The results of
EMSA demonstrated that VEGF inhibited the DNA-binding activity
of NF-␬B. Moreover, the results of qRT-PCR and western blotting
conﬁrmed that the canonical NF-␬B pathway was activated after
MCAO and inhibited by VEGF. This result was consistent with previous studies, which demonstrated that VEGF bound to the VEGF
receptor 1 (Flt-1) and blocked the TNF␣-induced and FLT3 ligandinduced activation of NF-␬B (Gabrilovich et al., 1998; Ohm et al.,
1999; Oyama et al., 1998). Anti-ﬂt-1 antibodies induced the NF-␬B
activation and reduced serum-deprived apoptosis in intimal vascular smooth muscle cells culture (Orlandi et al., 2010). Moreover,
VEGF has been shown to inhibit TNF␣-induced NF-␬B activation

97

via the VEGF receptor kinase-independent inhibition of IKK (Dikov
et al., 2001). In vivo, the overexpression of VEGF also reduced NF-␬B
activation (Kupatt et al., 2003). However, several previous studies illustrated that VEGF stimulated the DNA-binding activity of
NF-␬B (Kim et al., 2001; Marumo et al., 1999). In summary, the
present study demonstrated that VEGF aggravated BBB disruption
and brain edema after cerebral ischemia, and the decreased expression of Orm1 due to the inhibition of the NF-␬B pathway might be
one of the possible underlying mechanisms. These ﬁndings might
be helpful for improving our understanding of the mechanisms of
VEGF aggravating BBB disruption and brain edema. Furthermore,
these ﬁndings might help facilitate the application of VEGF for clinical stroke treatment by overcoming associated obstacles. However,
the ﬁndings in this study need to be validated further. In addition,
we did not investigate the pathways from VEGF to NF-␬B, which
should be explored in the next study.
