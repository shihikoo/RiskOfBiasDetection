Abstract
An angiogenesis factor, angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), is associated with the blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption after focal cerebral
ischemia. However, whether hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema after tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
treatment are related to the decrease in Ang1 expression in the BBB remains unknown. We hypothesized that administering
Ang1 might attenuate hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema after tPA treatment by stabilizing blood vessels and
inhibiting hyperpermeability. Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to thromboembolic focal cerebral ischemia were assigned to a
permanent ischemia group (permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion; PMCAO) and groups treated with tPA at 1 h or 4 h
after ischemia. Endogenous Ang1 expression was observed in pericytes, astrocytes, and neuronal cells. Western blot
analyses revealed that Ang1 expression levels on the ischemic side of the cerebral cortex were decreased in the tPA-1h, tPA4h, and PMCAO groups as compared to those in the control group (P = 0.014, 0.003, and 0.014, respectively). Ang1-positive
vessel densities in the tPA-4h and PMCAO groups were less than that in the control group (p = 0.002 and ,0.001,
respectively) as well as that in the tPA-1h group (p = 0.047 and 0.005, respectively). These results suggest that Ang1-positive
vessel density was maintained when tPA was administered within the therapeutic time window (1 h), while it was decreased
when tPA treatment was given after the therapeutic time window (4 h). Administering Ang1 fused with cartilage oligomeric
protein (COMP) to supplement this decrease has the potential to suppress hemorrhagic transformation as measured by
hemoglobin content in a whole cerebral homogenate (p = 0.007) and cerebral edema due to BBB damage (p = 0.038), as
compared to administering COMP protein alone. In conclusion, Ang1 might be a promising target molecule for developing
vasoprotective therapies for controlling hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema after tPA treatment.

cell–specific growth factor, vascular endothelial cell growth factor
(VEGF), in BBB, MMP-9 activation, degradation of BBB
components, and hemorrhagic transformation using a rat model
of thromboembolic focal cerebral ischemia [3],[4]. Compared
with tPA and control antibody, combination treatment with tPA
and the anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody significantly attenuated
VEGF expression in BBB, MMP-9 activation, degradation of BBB
components, and hemorrhagic transformation, and it also
improved motor outcome and mortality [3]. Therefore, inhibition
of VEGF signaling pathway may be a promising therapeutic
strategy for attenuating hemorrhagic transformation after tPA
treatment.
Another endothelial cell–specific growth factor, angiopoietin-1
(Ang1) [5], is known to bind to the receptor Tie-2, which is
expressed in various types of cells, such as endothelial cells,
pericytes, and neuronal cells [6],[7]. Ang1 is known to participate

Introduction
Thrombolytic treatment with tissue plasminogen activators
(tPA) has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a standard treatment for cerebral infarction, and its
therapeutic time window has recently been expanded to 4.5 h
after onset [1]. While tPA treatment can be expected to greatly
improve functional prognosis, administering it after its therapeutic
time window can cause hemorrhagic transformation, exacerbate
neurological symptoms, and even put the patient’s life in danger
[2]. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a vasoprotective
treatment to prevent the hemorrhagic transformation of tPA
treatment.
The hemorrhagic transformation that occurs after tPA treatment is thought to be caused by damage of the blood brain barrier
(BBB). We previously demonstrated that tPA treatment after the
therapeutic time window promoted expression of an endothelial

in the survival of endothelial cells, vascular remodeling, and
vascular maturation and stability [8],[9].
In addition, Ang1 has been reported to reduce postischemic
vascular hyperpermeability that is triggered by VEGF [10].
However, it remains unknown whether hemorrhagic transformation after tPA treatment is related to the decrease in endogenous
Ang1 after tPA treatment. Here, we hypothesized that administering Ang1 could attenuate hemorrhagic transformation and
cerebral edema after tPA treatment by stabilizing blood vessels
and inhibiting hyperpermeability. In this study, we performed tPA
treatment on a rat thromboembolic model in order to confirm
changes in Ang1 expression and to examine whether administering Ang1 would influence hemorrhagic transformation or cerebral
edema.

Thrombolytic treatment with tPA
tPA was administered intravenously in the form of alteplase (a
gift from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Co., Osaka, Japan) at a dose
of 10 mg/kg per animal. A PE50 catheter was inserted into the
rats right inguinal veins; 10% of the dose was first administered as
a bolus, and the remaining 90% was given continuously over
30 min. tPA treatment was performed 1 h after focal cerebral
ischemia in the tPA-1h group and 4 h after in the tPA-4h group.
The permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (PMCAO) group
did not receive tPA treatment, and the control group was not
operated on at all. The mortality rates of the permanent ischemia
group, tPA 1-hour group, and tPA 4-hour group were 17.4%,
6.7%, and 59.0% [3].

Neurological evaluations
Materials and Methods

Neurological evaluations were conducted 24 h after the cerebral
ischemia with a 6-point neurological scale [12]. Specifically, grade
5 indicated no neurological findings, grade 4 indicated an inability
to move forward with the foot of the affected side, grade 3
indicated weak resistance to a force that was applied from the side
on a level surface, grade 2 indicated turning to the affected side
when pulled from behind on a level surface, grade 1 indicated
spontaneously turning to the affected side, and grade 0 indicated
an inability to move spontaneously or death.

All operations concerning animal were performed according to
ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments)
guidelines [11].

Animal model
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The
protocol was approved by the Niigata University Administrative
Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (Permit Number: 36–4). All
surgery was performed under inhalation anesthesia, and all efforts
were made to minimize suffering.
The cerebral ischemia was created with the model of Okubo et
al., in which the animals had their middle cerebral artery (MCA)
blocked by autologous thrombi [3]. Specifically, male SpragueDawley rats (250–300 g body weight) (Tsukuba Breeding Center,
Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc., Ibaraki, Japan) were
anesthetized through the inhalation of a mixture of 1.8%
halothane, 30% oxygen, and 70% nitrous oxide. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.060.5uC during surgery. With
visualization aided with a surgical microscope, a midline incision
was made in the anterior neck area to expose the left common
carotid artery, the external carotid artery, and the internal carotid
artery. Next, the external carotid artery was ligated, and a stump
was severed. Then, an incision was made into the external carotid
artery, and a catheter was inserted into the left internal carotid
artery. A day ahead, 200 mL of the rat’s own blood was mixed with
50 mL of thrombin and injected into a 380-mm-diameter
polyethylene tube (PE20; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). After
storing it for 24–48 h at 4uC, thrombi that were 1 mm long were
cut off and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and then injected into
the middle cerebral artery using a 580-mm-diameter polyethylene
catheter (PE50; BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for about 30 s in
order to create a blockage (15 thrombi per animal).

Measuring the volume of the cerebral infarct and edema
Twenty-four h after the cerebral ischemia, the subjects were
given highly concentrated halothane and deeply anesthetized.
After transcardiac perfusion with cold saline, the brains were
extracted. The brains were cut into 3-mm slices and stained with a
2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution (#264310; BD,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). After staining, the slices were
photographed with a scanner (CanoScan LiDE 50; Canon Inc.,
Tokyo, Japan), and cerebral infarct volume and cerebral edema
volume were measured with NIH Image J software 1.46r (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) according to the
method of Swanson et al [13]. These values were expressed as the
proportion of the cerebral hemisphere occupied.

Measuring the amount of cerebral hemorrhage
The amount of cerebral hemorrhage was measured as the
amount of hemoglobin in all of the cerebral tissue with Drabkin’s
reagent (D5941; Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as reported
previously [14]. Specifically, the entire cerebrum was homogenized with 3 mL of PBS and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for
30 min. Then, 0.4 mL of the supernatant was mixed with 1.6 mL
of Drabkin’s reagent and incubated at 56uC for 10 min. Finally,
the absorbency was measured with an absorption spectrometer at
546 nm.

Western blot
Twenty-four h after the cerebral ischemia, the subjects were
euthanized with highly concentrated halothane, and transcardiac
perfusion with cold saline was performed (3 animals from each
group). The area of infarct was defined as the region showing
neuronal cell loss with degenerated neuropil structure (spongiform
appearance), and the non-infarct area surrounding the infarct area
was defined as the peri-infarct area. The corresponding areas of
the cerebral cortex were taken as samples. According to a
previously reported method, the extracted brain tissue was
homogenized by adding 7 times its weight of a cytolytic buffer
solution containing 1% Triton X-100 (#9803; Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA) and inhibitors for proteases

Cerebral blood flow measurement
Prior to vascular occlusion, the rats’ skulls were exposed and 2mm-diameter burr holes were created 2 mm posterior and 4 mm
to the left of the bregma. Cerebral blood flow was measured before
the surgery and 30 min after inducing the cerebral ischemia with a
laser Doppler flowmeter (ALF21; Advance Co., Tokyo, Japan).
The rats whose cerebral blood flow was less than 50% that before
ischemia were excluded [3].

centrifuging it at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. After measuring the
protein concentration of the supernatant with the bicinchoninic
acid method, 50 mg of protein was electrophoresed with Trisglycine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
[16]. Next, this was transcribed onto a polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane, and blocking was performed with 5% skim milk and
0.1% bovine serum albumin. The primary antibodies were the
rabbit polyclonal anti-Ang1 antibody (AB10516: EMD Millipore
Corporation, 1:1,000) and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Tie2
receptor antibody (AF2720: R&D Systems, Inc., 1:1,000), which
were reacted overnight at 4uC. After washing with PBS,
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody
was reacted at room temperature for 1 h. Chemiluminescence was
performed with chemiluminescent HRP substrate (EMD Millipore
Corporation), and the desired protein band was then photographed with ImageQuant LAS4000 (GE Healthcare Japan,
Tokyo, Japan). Actin was used as the internal control, and each
protein band was quantified with a densitometer.

Administration of COMP-Ang1 protein
Immediately before tPA administration in the tPA-4h group,
30 mg of the cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP)-Ang1 protein
(ALX-201-314; Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., Farmingdale, NY, USA)
that was dissolved in 200 mL of PBS was administered as a bolus
through a catheter in the inguinal vein. Because recombinant
Ang1 protein is poorly soluble, we used COMP-Ang1 protein,
which has a higher solubility and is more active [17]. It is
generated by replacing the N-terminal portion of the Ang1 protein
with the coiled-coil domain of COMP [17]. As a control, 30 mg of
COMP protein was similarly administered. The sample size was
calculated before performing the experiments. We calculated the
sample size needed to detect a difference in the amount of cerebral
hemorrhage or cerebral edema volume between the COMP-Ang1
group and the COMP group with 80% power (a, 0.05; one-sided
analysis; COMP-Ang1 group/COMP group = 1.2). This calculation was based on the values obtained in our previous
experiments [3]. A FLAG-tag was attached to the C terminus of
the COMP-Ang1 protein, so that COMP-Ang1 protein localization could be investigated with immunohistochemical staining with
an anti-FLAG antibody. The amount of cerebral hemorrhage, the
volumes of the cerebral infarct and edema, and neurological
evaluations were examined. These measurements were performed
in a randomized and blind fashion.

Immunohistochemical staining
Twenty-four h after cerebral ischemia, the rats were euthanized
with highly concentrated halothane, and transcardiac perfusion
with cold saline, which was followed by perfusion with 4%
paraformaldehyde, was performed. The extracted brains were
fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde that was dissolved in
20% sucrose. After methanol treatment, the samples were
embedded in paraffin and then cut into 4-mm slices. After
deparaffinization, the samples were reacted overnight at 4uC with
a goat polyclonal anti-Ang1 antibody (sc-6319: Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., 1:200) and then stained using the Vectastain
ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA, USA).

Measuring Ang1-positive vessel density
The infarct area and peri-infarct area [4], which had been
immunohistochemically stained with an anti-Ang1 antibody, and
the cerebral cortex from a non-ischemic control brain were
observed with an optical microscope at a magnification of 2006.
Ang1-positive vessel density was calculated in all fields of view.
The mean Ang1-positive vessel density was calculated from the
values of 3 random fields of view from each sample. Each Group
N = 9.

Statistical processing
All the data are presented as mean 6 SEM. Differences in the
parameters were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test or Mann-Whitney U
test. Differences in the frequencies were assessed with Fisher’s
exact test. All the tests were considered statistically significant at P
values ,0.05.

Localization of endogenous Ang1 in non-ischemic rat
brains

The examination of Ang1 localization was performed according
to a previously reported method of immunofluorescence staining
that uses the free-floating method [16]. Twenty-four h after
cerebral ischemia, the rats were euthanized, and transcardiac
perfusion with cold saline, which was followed by perfusion with
4% paraformaldehyde, was performed. The brains were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde. Next, the samples were cut into 50-mm
slices with a vibratome (VT1000S; Leica Biosystems, Nussloch,
Germany). Three-dimensional (3D) images were reconstructed
with IMARIS imaging software (IMARIS 6.4.2; Bitplane AG,
Zurich, Switzerland) from images that were taken at 0.23-mm
intervals along the Z axis.
The primary antibodies that were used were a rabbit polyclonal
anti-Ang1 antibody (ab93599: Abcam plc, 1:100), mouse monoclonal anti-RECA1 antibody (MCA-970R: AbD Serotec, 1:250),
mouse monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
antibody (3670: Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., 1:250), goat

Immunohistochemical staining with the anti-Ang1 antibody was
performed in order to clarify the localization of endogenous Ang1
in non-ischemic rat brains. Colocalization of endogenous Ang1
and the endothelial cell marker RECA1 was not observed, even
though the endogenous Ang1 expression was observed on the
outside of RECA1 (Figures 1Aa–d). However, the colocalization of
endogenous Ang1 with the pericyte marker PDGFRb (Figure 1Ae–
h) and the astrocyte marker GFAP (Figure 1Ai–l) was observed.
Moreover, the punctate colocalization of Ang1 with the neuronal
cell marker MAP2 was observed on the cytoplasm of neuronal cells
(Figures 1Am–p). In 3D images of RECA1 and endogenous Ang1,
endogenous Ang1 expression was not observed in endothelial cells,
but the expression of Ang1 is consistent with the localization
pattern of pericytes (Figure 1Ba). In 3D images of MAP2 and
endogenous Ang1, punctate endogenous Ang1 expression was
observed in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells (Figure 1Bb). We did

confirm the effects of COMP-Ang1 protein on the Ang1-Tie2
receptor signaling pathway, COMP-Ang1 protein was administered intravenously at doses of 5 mg, 10 mg, and 30 mg. Twentyfour h later, Western blotting was performed on these cerebral
cortical samples to quantify the levels of expression of phosphoTie2 receptors, which reflect Ang1 receptor activation. Because
the only 30-mg dose resulted in increased phospho-Tie2 receptor
expression compared to brains that did not receive COMP-Ang1
(data not shown), this dose was used for the following experiments.
In addition, immunofluorescent staining was performed in order
to confirm whether the COMP-Ang1 protein was reaching the
microvessels and neuronal cells of the infarct area and the periinfarct area at the 30-mg dose. In the tPA-4h group, anti-FLAG
antibody-stained COMP-Ang1 protein mainly colocalized with
the pericyte marker PDGFRb in the peri-infarct area (Figure 4Be–

marker RECA1 (Figure 4Ba–d) and the astrocyte marker GFAP
(Figure 4Bi–l). Incorporation of COMP-Ang1 protein into
neuronal cells was observed in peri-infarct area (Figure 4Bm-p),
but not in infarct area (data not shown). We did not note any
signal when using only the secondary antibody (Figure S2).

not note any signal when using only the secondary antibody
(Figure S1).

Effects of focal cerebral ischemia on endogenous Ang1
expression
Changes in endogenous Ang1 expression 24 h after focal
cerebral ischemia were investigated with Western blotting.
Endogenous Ang1 expression levels on the ischemic side of the
cerebral cortex were decreased in the tPA-1h, tPA-4h, and
PMCAO groups as compared to that in the control group
(P = 0.014, 0.003, and 0.014, respectively; Figures 2A, B). The
Ang1 expression level in the tPA-4h group was the lowest among
the ischemic groups, although there were no significant differences
among these groups (Figure 2B). Protein fragments that would
suggest limited degradation were not found.

Effects of focal cerebral ischemia on endogenous Ang1positive vessels
Because endogenous Ang1 expression was observed in neuronal
cells in addition to cerebral blood vessels (Figure 1Am–p),
immunohistochemical staining was used to quantify endogenous
Ang1-positive vessel density 24 h after focal cerebral ischemia with
the goal of evaluating endogenous Ang1 expression in cerebral
blood vessels (Figure 3A). Endogenous Ang1-positive vessel density
in the tPA-1h group was not reduced as compared to that in the
control group (p = 0.105), while those of the tPA-4h and PMCAO
groups were reduced in comparison to that of the control group
(p = 0.002 and ,0.001, respectively) (Figure 3B). In addition,
endogenous Ang1-positive vessel densities in the tPA-4h and
PMCAO groups were lower than that in the tPA-1h group
(p = 0.047 and 0.005, respectively) (Figure 3B).

Effects of COMP-Ang1 protein administration on
hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema after
tPA treatment
In order to confirm the effects of administering COMP-Ang1
protein on the hemorrhagic transformation and the cerebral
edema that occur after tPA treatment, a comparison was made
between the tPA-4h group, which received 30 mg of COMP-Ang1
protein, and a control group given 30 mg of COMP protein and
tPA at 4 h after ischemia. In a whole cerebral homogenate,
hemoglobin was shown to be significantly lower in the group that
received the COMP-Ang1 protein (0.093 mg/dL vs. 0.144 mg/
dL; p = 0.007) (Figure 5A). Cerebral edema was significantly
suppressed in the COMP-Ang1 group compared to the COMP
group (17.8% vs. 35.9%; p = 0.038) (Figure 5B). No significant
difference was observed between the groups for cerebral infarct
volume (40.7% vs. 41.0%; p = 0.983) (Figure 5C). On the 6-point
neurological score, grade 4 was only observed in the COMP-Ang1
group, and this group tended to have fewer grade-0 scores, but,
overall, no significant differences were observed (p = 0.295)
(Figure 5D).

Incorporation of COMP-Ang1 protein into pericytes
Next, in order to investigate whether administering Ang1
protein would be effective against BBB damage after tPA
treatment, Ang1 protein was intravenously administered immediately before tPA administration in the tPA-4h group. In order to

Discussion
This study first examined the expression of endogenous Ang1 in
non-ischemic rat brain tissue, confirming its expression in
pericytes, astrocytes, and neuronal cells. Previous studies have
confirmed that endogenous Ang1 is produced in pericytes [18] and
is expressed in astrocytes [19] and tumor cells [20]. These were
consistent with the results of this study. Furthermore, while very
small levels of expression have been reported in neuronal cells at
the mRNA level [21], this study is the first to confirm the
expression in neuronal cells at the protein level with cytoplasmic
punctate localization.
Next, we demonstrated that endogenous Ang1 expression
decreased after focal cerebral ischemia. A few studies have
reported changes in Ang1 expression at the mRNA and protein
levels after cerebral ischemia [19],[22],[23], but views on the
matter are not settled. Furthermore, we could not find any studies
that investigated changes in endogenous Ang1 expression after
tPA treatment. By Western blotting, the ischemic group, especially
the tPA-4h group, exhibited decreases in endogenous Ang1
expression 24 h after cerebral ischemia as compared to the

many such transformation, compared to those in the control and
tPA-1h groups. This finding suggests that decreased endogenous
Ang1 expression plays a role in hemorrhagic events that occur
when tPA is administered after the therapeutic time window.
Because Ang1 plays a role in vascular stability [9], the decreased
Ang1 level may have resulted in BBB damage. However,
endogenous Ang1 expression did decrease in the PMCAO group,

observed in the tPA-4h group were due to BBB damage, we
focused on the changes in endogenous Ang1 levels in the BBB by
using immunohistochemical staining to examine the endogenous
Ang1 expression in the BBB. Ang1-positive vessel density in the

not decreased compared to that in the control group, but a

Furthermore, this study demonstrated that the administered
COMP-Ang1 protein colocalized with pericytes and not endothelial cells. Future studies need to confirm whether COMP-Ang1
could suppress hemorrhagic transformation and cerebral edema
after tPA treatment by suppressing the permeability that is
mediated by PDGF-B signaling in pericytes.
In contrast, this study demonstrated that COMP-Ang1 protein
could not decrease infarct size, although a previous study reported
its neuroprotective effect [10],[29]. Several reasons can be given
for this lack of neuroprotective effects of COMP-Ang1 protein,
which may include the timing and method of administration.
Further studies need to be conducted whether the timing and
method of administration of COMP-Ang1 protein may influence
the neuroprotective effects.

suggests that hemorrhagic transformation is not only regulated by
Ang1, but may also be dependent on a variety of factors, including
tPA usage, VEGF [3], PDGF [24], and angiopoietin-2 as reported
by other investigators [23].
In order to confirm that reduced endogenous Ang1 expression
was involved in the hemorrhagic transformation after tPA
treatment, COMP-Ang1 protein was administered concurrently
with tPA treatment. We demonstrated that COMP-Ang1 protein
could suppress the hemorrhagic transformation as well as cerebral
edema after tPA treatment. Several studies have reported that the
ability of Ang1 to suppress vascular hyperpermeability occurs by
increasing glycocalyx in endothelial cells [25], acting on tight
junction proteins [26], shrinking intercellular spaces [27], and by
working through signaling by PDGF-B in pericytes [28].

Effect of Ang1 on Hemorrhage and Edema after tPA

Figure 5. Effects of COMP-Ang1 protein administration on the tPA-4h group. These panels show the amount of cerebral hemorrhage (A),
cerebral edema volume (B), cerebral infarct volume (C), and the prognosis with a 6-point neurological scale score (D) 24 h after ischemia. A-C were
performed on the COMP-Ang1 group (N = 5) and the COMP group (N = 5). D was performed on the COMP-Ang1 group (N = 11) and the COMP group
(N = 9). Cerebral edema and infarct volumes are expressed as proportions on the ischemic side of the cerebral hemisphere. The amount of cerebral
hemorrhage is expressed as hemoglobin concentration in a whole cerebral homogenate. COMP; cartilage oligomeric protein, COMP-Ang1; cartilage

The present study has a limitation that we could not quantify
brain edema by wet-dry measurement or Evans blue leakage using
in vivo studies. Further studies are required to determine the effects
of COMP-Ang1 on cerebral edema after tPA treatment.
In conclusion, this study clarified the localization of endogenous
Ang1 in pericytes, astrocytes, and neuronal cells in non-ischemic
rat brain tissue. In addition, Ang1-positive vessel density decreased
when tPA treatment for focal cerebral ischemia was performed
after the therapeutic time window. Because administering COMPAng1 protein may result in the suppression of hemorrhagic
transformation and cerebral edema, Ang1 can be considered to be
a promising target molecule for vasoprotective treatment to
prevent the BBB damage that accompanies tPA treatment.
