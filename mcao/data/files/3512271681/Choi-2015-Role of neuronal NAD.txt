The molecular mechanism underlying the selective vulnerability of neurons to oxidative
damage caused by ischemia—reperfusion (I/R) injury remains unknown. We sought to determine the role of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) in cerebral I/R-induced brain injury and survival
of newborn cells in the ischemic injured region. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 90 min
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. After reperfusion, infarction size, level of superoxide and 8-hydroxy-20 -deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-2dG), and Nox1
immunoreactivity were determined. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Nox1 was used to investigate the role of Nox1 in I/R-induced oxidative damage, neuronal death, motor function recovery, and ischemic neurogenesis. After I/R, Nox1 expression and 8-oxo-2dG
immunoreactivity was increased in cortical neurons of the peri-infarct regions. Both infarction size and neuronal death in I/R injury were significantly reduced by adeno-associated
virus (AAV)-mediated transduction of Nox1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA). AAV-mediated
Nox1 knockdown enhanced functional recovery after MCAO. The level of survival and differentiation of newborn cells in the peri-infarct regions were increased by Nox1 inhibition.
Our data suggest that Nox-1 may be responsible for oxidative damage to DNA, subsequent
cortical neuronal degeneration, functional recovery, and regulation of ischemic neurogenesis in the peri-infarct regions after stroke.

Introduction
Cerebral ischemia occurs because of a local reduction or an arrest of blood supply, and can lead
to neuronal cell death in the ischemic region. Focal cerebral ischemia is the most common subtype of clinical stroke. Since the establishment of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)reperfusion, in rats as an animal model of focal ischemia [1], this model has been widely used to
study injury and recovery after stroke [2]. The pathophysiological mechanisms of the ischemia
—reperfusion (I/R) injury are complex. Cell death progresses within minutes in the ischemic

core, whereas in the peripheral zones of the infarct, which are perfused by collateral blood vessels, active cell death mechanisms are recruited and proceed more slowly, rendering the peri-infarct tissue more likely to be rescued by pharmacological treatment or modulation of
circumstances [3]. Molecular mechanisms leading to cell death during ischemic brain injury include excitotoxicity and ionic imbalance, free radical stress, and apoptotic-like cell demise [3, 4].
NADPH oxidases (Nox) play an important role in I/R tissue injury of various organs, including the brain. Indeed, under certain conditions, Nox proteins can generate large amounts
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and several enzymes of this protein family and their cytosolic
activator proteins are expressed in the central nervous system [5]. Nox has been shown to play
a significant role in I/R-induced brain injury through superoxide production. The family of
Nox proteins is currently known to consist of seven members. Nox1, Nox2 (previously termed
gp91phox), and Nox4 are expressed under physiological conditions in the central nervous system, including in intracranial vessels and neuronal tissues [5–7]. The role of Nox2 in I/Rinduced brain injury has been extensively studied [6–8]. A role for Nox4 in infarcted brain tissue after I/R injury has been demonstrated [9, 10]. The higher expression of Nox1 and Nox4
compared with Nox2 in endothelial cells of cerebral arteries [5] suggests a prominent function
for these enzymes in the cerebral vasculature. Few studies have addressed the role of Nox1 in
experimental stroke. A moderate reduction in lesion volume and cerebral edema, and an ameliorated blood—brain barrier (BBB) leakage with relatively mild ischemic damage (60 min ischemia followed by 23 h of reperfusion) was observed after knockout of Nox1 [9]. However, a
lack of Nox1 was found not to confer protection in transient [9, 11, 12] or permanent [9] cerebral ischemia. Therefore, the precise role of Nox1 in I/R injury is controversial and
remains unknown.
Stroke enhances subventricular zone (SVZ) cell proliferation, and that these cells can differentiate into mature striatal neurons and replace damaged neurons [7, 12]. However, the vast
majority of neuroblasts die primarily by apoptotic mechanisms, and only a small population of
newly generated neurons survive beyond 6 weeks (w) after stroke [13–16]. The reasons why
these death-promoting events are activated are not known. However, because the environment
of newly arrived cells must be receptive if they are to survive, providing trophic support and
eventually leading to their integration within the tissue [16], many experimental trials have
been undertaken to enhance endogenous neurogenesis after stroke [5, 6, 9, 12]. Therefore, in
order to find a microenvironment promoting the survival of newborn cells in ischemic neurogenesis, we determined the role of Nox1 in I/R-induced oxidative damage and the effect of
Nox1 on the survival of newborn cells in ischemic neurogenesis after stroke.

Materials and Methods
Animals
A total of 128 Male Wistar rats (8 weeks, weighing 291 + 2.57 g; Samtako BioKorea. Co. Ltd.,
Korea; 44 sham control rats and 84 MCAO operated rats) were enrolled in this study. Animals
were singly housed in smooth bottomed plastic cages (28 W X 42 D X 20 H (cm)) with beta
chip bedding (Agrolab group, Bavaria, Germany) in a specific pathogen free room maintained
on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. The room temperature
was maintained at 22°C. The room was illuminated by incandescent lamps (luminous flux,
11.77lm). In order to accustom the animals to the laboratory environment, an acclimation period of 2 weeks was allowed before the initiation of the experiment.
Animal treatments including anesthesia and euthanasia were carried out in accordance with
the Principle of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH publication No. 85–23, revised 1985). All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Experiment Review Board of Laboratory

operation or MCAO. Sham operated rat (SC) and MCAO rats were used for superoxide detection, protein expression studies, and immunohistochemical
analysis at 6 hours (6 h), 1 day (1 d), 1 week (1 w), and 2 weeks (2 w) after MCAO. In Nox1 knockdown study, AAV particles containing either Nox1 shRNA/
AAV or scramble shRNA/AAV (Scr-shRNA/AAV) were stereotaxically injected into the cortex and striatum at 4 weeks before the MCAO or sham-operation.
SC and MCAO rats received an injection of the cell proliferation marker BrdU (50 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily) from days 5 to 14 after sham or MCAO operation. All
animals were used for behavioral analysis, histological study and protein expression study. (b) Schematic diagrams of the infarct core and the peri-infarct

Animal Research Center of Konkuk University (KU10065). They are in accordance with the
Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) criteria [17] for preclinical stroke investigations. Detailed timeline for experiment were described (Fig. 1a).

Rat model of focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% for surgical induction, 1.75% for maintenance) in
NO2: O2 (70%:30%) during surgical procedures. Body temperature was monitored continuously with a rectal probe and maintained at 37.5°C ± 0.5°C using a heating pad. MCAO model
was established by proximal occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery with the use of a
4–0 silicone-coated nylon monofilament (5 mm length of the coated end with a diameter of
0.35 mm) [18]. After 90-min occlusion, reperfusion was accomplished by careful withdrawal of
the monofilament and the rats were returned to their cages.
In Nox1 expression study, among the 48 rats, 40 of them underwent middle cerebral artery
occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO-r) surgery and the 32 survivors were equally distributed into the
MCAO-6 h (hours), the MCAO-1 d (day), the MCAO-1 w (week), and the MCAO-2 w (weeks)
groups, as indicated below. Thus, the survival rate after MCAO-r, comprising the rats of MCAO6 h, the MCAO-1 d, the MCAO-1 w, and the MCAO-2 w groups, was 80.0%. Consequently, the
remaining 32 animals were randomly assigned to the following 5 groups: 1) MCAO-6 h (n = 8),
2) MCAO-1 d group (n = 8) 3) MCAO-1 w group (n = 8), 4) MCAO-2 w group, 5) Sham control
group (SC, n = 8). SCs were treated similarly to the operated rats except the MCAO. After the operation, rats were kept in an animal resource facility with food and water ad libitum. Four rats
for histological analysis and 4 rats for Western blot analysis were used.
In Nox1 knockdown study, 80 rats were subjected to stereotaxic injection of AAV particles
containing either Nox1 shRNA/AAV (Nox1 shRNA, n = 40) or scrable shRNA /AAV (scrshRNA n = 40) into the cortex and striatum. After 4 weeks, 22 rats of the 40 Nox1 shRNA-injected rats and 22 rats of the 40 scr-shRNA-injected rats underwent MCAO-reperfusion
(MCAO-r) surgery and the 36 survivors (survival rate = 82.3%) and 36 sham control rats were
equally distributed into the animals were randomized in four different groups using 2-by-2

table of MCAO or shRNA/AAV, including 1) sham operated scr-shRNA (n = 18), 2) sham operated Nox1 shRNA (n = 18), 3) MCAO operated scr-shRNA (n = 18), and 4) MCAO operated
Nox1 shRNA (n = 18). Animals were sacrificed at 2 weeks (n = 10/group) and 4 weeks after
MCAO-reperfusion (n = 8/group). Animals were number-coded and investigators were always
blinded to the treatment groups until the end of the data analysis. Occlusion and reperfusion
were verified in each animal by laser Doppler flowmetry (Moor Instruments, UK).

In situ visualization of superoxide
The spatial production of O2 − during cerebral ischemia was investigated by the in situ detection of oxidized hydroethidine (HEt) method as previously described [19] with minor modifications. HEt (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) is taken up by living cells and oxidized to a red
fluorescent dye, ethidium, specifically by O2 −, but not by other reactive oxygen species in the
cells [20]. Briefly, on 6 h, 1 d, 1 w, or 2 w post-MCAO operation, rats were injected i.p. with
2 ml of PBS containing 1 ug/ul HEt and 1% dimethysulfoxide. Animals (n = 4/group) were sacrificed 60 min later, and the brain was removed and frozen in dry ice. The cortex and striatum
sections (30 μm thick) mounted onto gelatin-coated glass slides were examined for HEt oxidation product, ethidium accumulation, by fluorescence microscopy.

Nissl staining
Rats (n = 8/group) were deeply anesthetized ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) mixture (i.p.) and transcardially perfused with saline containing 0.5% sodium nitrite and 10 U/ml
heparin sulfate, followed by cold 4% formaldehyde generated from paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
PBS (pH 7.2). Brains were post-fixed in the same solution for overnight and infiltrated with
30% sucrose overnight. Free-floating sections (40 μm) were obtained from from bregma—5.2
to 2.2 mm using a Cryostat. Sections were mounted in glass slide and then stained Nissl. Nissl
staining was incubated in 0.1% Cresyl violet solution for 10 minutes at room temperature and
rinsed quickly in distilled water, and dehydrated in serial diluted ethanol and cleaned in xylene.
Images of the mounted sections were captured with a CCD camera (Cohu Inc., San Diego, CA,
USA) mounted above a light box (Biotec-Fischer Colour Control 5000, Reiskirchin, Germany).
Using this method, only viable non-infarcted tissue is stained, making the infarct area clearly
visible. The infarct areas and the peri-infarct areas were indicated as a schematic diagram
(Fig. 1b).

Measurement of infarct volume
Using Nissl stained section, infarct volume (total, cortical and subcortical) was quantified
using image analysis software (ImageJ v1.3, NIH), correcting for brain edema, according to the
following formula: CIV = [LHA−(RHA−RIA)]×THICKNESS OF SLICE, where CIV is corrected infarct volume, LHA is left hemisphere area, RHA is right hemisphere area and RIA is
right hemisphere infarct area [12]. Corrected infarct volumes and the distance between individual brain sections were then used to estimate the total infarct volume.

Sampling procedure
Rats (n = 4/group) were deeply anesthetized ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) mixture (i.p.), and the brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold saline. They were then
placed on a chilled glass plate with the ventral surface uppermost, and the MCAs were identified. Three blocks of tissue, *1 mm thick per block, were removed by transecting the brain
coronally with a razor blade bracketing the origin of the MCA at ~ 10 mm from the interaural

line. Areas were sampled in each animal according to the individual distribution of the infarction, which can be easily detected with the naked eye because it is significantly whiter than the
rest of the tissue. The tissue blocks were placed flat on the dish, and samples were taken with
sterile forceps from the infarct area, the peri-infarct area (outer borders of the infarction), and
the contralateral hemisphere homologous to the infarct area and the peri-infarct area.

Western blot analysis
Tissues (n = 4/group) were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice in RIPA buffer (50mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) containing
a protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Thirty
μg of soluble protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto a PVDF membrane. Specific protein bands were detected by using specific anti-Nox1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-Nox2 (BD bioscience, San Jose, CA.) antibodies and
Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

Cell culture
Murine aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) taken from Wild-type and Nox1 knockout mice
(C57BL/6x129SvEv) were generously donated by Dr. Yun Soo Bae (Ewha Womans University)
[19]. SMC were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 IU/l penicillin, and 10 g/ml streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2 supply in humidified atmosphere. For experiments, the cells were
plated on polystyrene tissue culture dishes at a density of 1×106 cells/well in 6-well culture plates,
or 2×106 cells/100 mm plate. Experiments were performed using SMC between passages 6 and 8.

Rac1 activation assay
1 mg of protein extracted from peri-infarct tissue (n = 4/groups) was incubated with 10 mg of
agarose beads containing p21-binding domain (PBD) of the p21-activated protein kinase 1
(PAK1), an effector of activated Rac, for 1 hr at 4°C. The beads were collected by centrifugation
and washed two times in the lysis buffer. The beads were resuspended in sample buffer and
boiled for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 10–20% Tricine gel, transferred
electrophoretically and visualized using anti-rat Rac1 antibody (Cell BioLabs, Inc. CA, USA) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. For the positive control, the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTPgS was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Cell BioLabs, INC. CA, USA).

BrdU labeling
Neurogenesis was assessed by analyzing incorporation of BrdU (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA), a thymidine analog and a marker of proliferating cells. BrdU solutions were prepared at
5 mg/mL in sterile saline with 0.007 N NaOH to obtain a 50 mg/kg dose (10 mL/kg). Shamoperated rats and rats with MCAO received an injection of the cell proliferation marker BrdU
(50 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily) from days 5 to 14.

Immunohistochemistry
For 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-deoxyguanine (8-oxo-dG) staining, brain sections were incubated in
70% ethanol precooled to -20°C for 10 min on ice followed by 4 N HCl to denature DNA. After
rinsing with PBS, the sections were soaked in 37°C PBS supplemented with 100 μg/ml DNasefree RNase A for 1 h. Sections were washed in 0.1 M PBS, incubated in 0.1 M PBS containing
5% normal goat serum and 0.3% TritonX-100 for 1 h, and subsequently incubated overnight
with mouse monoclonal 8-oxo-dG (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA, 1:1,000) antibody 4°C.

The sections were then incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Lab, Burlingame,
CA, USA, 1:500) for 1 h, followed by avidin/biotin/peroxidase (Vector Lab, Burlingame, CA,
USA) staining for 1 h in a humidified chamber. 0.1 M PBS containing 1.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used to wash sections on slides between all
steps. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by incubation for 2 min in 0.05% 3,3’diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.003% H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) and then mounted sequentially in glass slides using permanent mounting
medium (Vector Lab, Burlingame,CA, USA). Mounted slices were evaluated on
light microscope.

Double fluorescent immunostaining of tissues
Free-floating sections (40 μm) were washed in 0.1 M PBS, incubated in 0.1 M PBS containing
5% normal donkey serum and 0.3% TritonX-100 for 1 h, and subsequently incubated overnight
with primary antibodies (Nox1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA, 1:500;

1:500; NeuN, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, 1:1000; active caspase-3, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Danvers, MA, USA, 1:500) in 2% normal donkey serum (Vector Lab, Burlingame,CA,
USA) in PBS at 4°C and incubated in a 1:200 dilution of Alexa Fluor conjugated donkey antirabbit (546) or donkey anti-mouse (647) antibodies (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) for
1h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and then mounted sequentially in glass slides using
Vectashield (Vector Lab, Burlingame, CA, USA). Mounted slices were evaluated for fluorescence under settings for 546 and 647 emissions on a confocal microscope (Olympus, USA).

Establishment of U6-NOX1 shRNA-CMV-EGFP/AAV and AAV viral
package
U6 promoter-driven shRNA expression system was established in AAV2 vector. EGFP expression is separately controlled by a CMV promoter as a marker for the transduction efficiency.
Nox1 shRNA was designed based on the siRNA sequence (5’-CCTTTGCTTCC
TTCTTGAAATCTAT-3’) which efficiently knocked down Nox1 expression in N27 cells [21].
Rat Nox1 shRNA sequence (5’-AGCTTCCTTTGCTTCCTTCTTGAAATCTATTTCAAGAGAAT AGATTTCAAGAAGGAAGC AAAGGTTTTTTG-3’) was inserted between HindIII
and EcoRI sites in the U6-CMV-EGFP/AAV vector. Either empty vector or NOX1 shRNA/
AAV were co-transfected with pHelper and pAAV-RC to HEK293 cells using a standard calcium phosphate method. After 72 h, the cells were harvested and crude rAAV vector solutions
were obtained by repeated freeze/thaw cycles. The cleared crude lysate was then applied on a
heparin-agarose column (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). After all the lysate went through the
column, the matrix was washed twice with 25 ml of PBS (pH 7.4, 0.1M NaCl). The virus was
then eluted with 15 ml of PBS (pH 7.4, 0.4M NaCl). The elutes was concentrated to about 1ml
with a Millipore Centriplus YM-30 Centrifugal Filter by centrifugation 4000 rpm, 15–40 min.
To adjust the NaCl concentration to physiological levels, the filter device was refilled with PBS,
pH 7.4, and the virus was concentrated to 250–300 ul again. After removal of the viruscontaining solution, the membrane of the filter device was washed three times with 100 ul of
PBS, pH 7.4, which was added to the main part of the recombinant AAV2. The fractions containing high-titer rAAV vectors were collected and used for injection into animals. The number
of rAAV genome copies was semiquantified by PCR within the CMV promoter region using
primers 5’-GACGTCAATAATGACGTATG-3’ and 5’-GGTAATAGCGATGACTAATACG-3’.

Role of Nox1 in the Stroke

Adeno associated virus 2-mediated Nox1 knockdown
AAV particles containing either Nox1 shRNA/AAV or empty vector/AAV [21] were stereotaxically injected into the cortex and striatum for 4 weeks prior to MCAO operation. All rats were
respectively allocated into 2 groups (n = 40/group), Nox1 shRNA/AAV and scramble shRNA/
AAV as control groups. Rats were deeply anesthetized ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine
(5 mg/kg) mixture (i.p.) and placed in a rat stereotaxic apparatus, two sites in the right cortex
[coordinate: anteroposterior (AP), –0.4 mm; mediolateral (ML), + 2.0 mm; dorsoventral
(DV), –1.5 mm] and striatum [coordinate: AP, –0.4 mm; ML, + 2.0 mm; DV, –5.0 mm] that
are predicted to become the peri-infarct regions at 2 weeks after MCAO surgery were selected
to inject Nox1 shRNA/AAV and scramble shRNA/AAV, respectively, according to the grouping. A total of 1x1011 genome copy/ml recombinant AAV particles encoding shNox1, or empty
vector diluted in 2 μl ice-cold sterilized phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were used in every animal. The injection rate was 0.5 μl/min, and the syringe was kept in place for an additional
5 min before being retracted slowly. Rats were subjected to sham or MCAO surgery after
4 weeks. Animals were sacrificed at 2 weeks (n = 10/group) and 4 weeks after MCAOreperfusion (n = 8/group). Tissue sections and protein extractions taken from brain tissues of
SC and MCAO animals were used in histological analysis (n = 6~8/group) and Western blot
analysis (n = 4/group), respectively.

Quantitative analysis
Sections including the cortex and striatum from 4~6 rats per group were subjected to analysis.
Five regions of interests (ROIs) of 0.1mm2 per one section in the peri-infarct areas (bregma
-0.4 to 2 mm; 6 sections per rat, every fifth sections) were selected. The number of DHE-,
NeuN-, 8-oxo-dG-, Nox1-, BrdU-, Ki67-, or DCX-positive cells were counted in each ROI and
averaged. Data represented as percentage of total cell. All quantitative analyses were carried out
in a blind manner.

The parallel bar walking test
Parallel bar testing (n = 8/group) was particularly sensitive to the hindlimb coordination impairment [22]. The parallel bar apparatus consisted of two parallel wooden rods (1.0 cm diameter each, 100 cm long), with an inter-rod distance of 2.5 cm, connected to platforms at each
end (15 x 50 cm2). The number of times that the subject placed two hind paws on one rod,
dropped a hind paw below the rod, or fell or swung under the rods was recorded. Number of
errors made per meter in 1 min were calculated and scored. The graded scoring system ranges
from 0 to 5 depending on the motor function behavior.
0–5 point grading scale
0, No error;
1, Less than 1 error made within 1 min per meter length;
2, Equal or more than one error made within 1 min per meter length;
3, More than two error made within 1 min per meter length;
4, More than 3.5 error made within 1 min per meter length;
5, More than six errors or cannot traverse.

Data analysis and statistics
Data are expressed as percentages of values obtained in control conditions, and are presented
as mean ± S.E.M. Statistical analysis between two groups was assessed using a two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t test. Differences among three, four, or five groups were analyzed using a one-

way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls Multiple Comparison Test. The parallel bar walking
test were analyzed using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed
by a post hoc least significant differences multiple comparisons test. Values of P < 0.05 were
considered significant. All data analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 software.

Results
Increase in superoxide generation and DNA oxidation in the brain after
ischemia—reperfusion injury
Cresyl violet staining in the lateral part of the striatum disappeared at 6 hours (h) of reperfusion after 90 min of MCAO. Areas of infarction were noted in the striatum and in MCA-related
areas of the parietal cortex. The extent of infarction widened further at 1 day (d), 1 week (w),
and 2 w after reperfusion to include the entire MCA territory in the parietal cortex. Representations of the extent of the infarct area and peri-infarct regions are shown in Fig. 1b and Fig. 2a.
Generation of superoxide was observed in the peri-infarct regions (Fig. 2a) of rats with
MCAO—reperfusion injury. Superoxide levels increased significantly in NeuN-positive neurons of the peri-infarct regions at 6 h, 1 d, 1 w, and 2 w after MCAO—reperfusion (Fig. 2b and
c). Some NeuN-positive cells displayed irregular morphology in the peri-infarct region at 1 d,
1 w, and 2 w after MCAO—reperfusion.
DNA oxidation also increased in the peri-infarct regions at 2 w after MCAO—reperfusion
(Fig. 2d and e).

Increased Nox1 expression after MCAO—reperfusion in neurons of the
peri-infarct regions
To determine the expression of the superoxide generator Nox1, we first immunoblotted protein extracts from tissue. Nox1 expression and Rac1 activation in protein extracts taken from
the peri-infarct regions (Fig. 1b) significantly increased at 6 h, 1 d, 1 w, and 2 w after MCAO—
reperfusion. Nox2 expression increased at 1 d, 1 w, and 2 w after MCAO—reperfusion (Fig. 3a,
b, and c). The intensity of Nox1 expression was higher than that of Nox2 expression. To confirm the results of the Nox1 immunoblotting analysis, total lysates of the smooth muscle cells
(SMC) of Nox1 knockout mice were used as a negative control (Fig. 3a and c). In Western blot
analysis, Nox1 was not detected in the SMC of Nox1- deficient mice. However, Nox2 was expressed constitutively in the SMC of Nox1- deficient mice. To localize Nox1 expression in the
brain, tissue sections were immunostained for Nox1 and NeuN, GFAP, or CD11b. Nox1 expression was significantly increased in the neurons of the peri-infarct regions (Fig. 3d) at 1 w
after MCAO—reperfusion. Neurons immunostained for Nox1 (red) had coexpression of
NeuN (green) in the peri-infarct regions (Fig. 3d) indicating neuron-specific expression of
Nox1 (Fig. 3e and f).
Neither astrocytes nor microglia expressed Nox1 in the peri-infarct regions, as verified by
coimmunostaining of Nox1 with GFAP (astrocytes) or CD11b (microglia) (Fig. 3g and h).

To investigate the role of Nox1 in MCAO, an AAV2 containing an shRNA targeting Nox1 was
delivered stereotaxically into the cortex and striatum (Fig. 4c and d). The vectors expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) separately, as a marker of transduction efficiency
(Fig. 4a and b). AAV2 containing the shRNA construct was transferred to neurons in the
brain, and efficiently knocked down Nox1 expression. MCAO was performed at 4 w after

4 w before MCAO-reperfusion significantly diminished the resulting infarction volume. Infarction volume was measured by Nissl staining of brain tissues on day 28 after MCAO (Fig. 5a).
The infarction volume from MCAO-reperfusion in the rats with and without Nox1 knockdown
was compared. Transient MCAO (90 min) and reperfusion (4 w) resulted in an infarct in the
ipsilateral half of the brain encompassing the cerebral cortex and striatum from—5.2 to +2.8
from bregma. The total infarct volume from MCAO-reperfusion was significantly different between the rats treated with scrambled shRNA viral particles (scbRNA) (100%) and those treated with Nox1 shRNA particles (Fig. 5b).

AAV-mediated Nox1 knockdown enhanced functional recovery after
MCAO
Functional recovery was determined using parallel bar tests in rats at—1, 2, 7, 14, and 28 d
after MCAO. Parallel bar scores were significantly different between the control group and the
Nox1 knockdown group on day 28 after MCAO (P<0.05, Fig. 5c).

AAV-mediated Nox1 knockdown reduced neuronal death and astrocyte
activation after MCAO
The number of NeuN-positive neurons in Nox1 shRNA-expressing rats was significantly less
than in rats without transduction (Fig. 5d). In similar experiments, Nox1 knockdown significantly reduced TUNEL-positive neuronal death elicited by MCAO—reperfusion, indicating
that inhibition of Nox1 expression attenuated MCAO—reperfusion-elicited neuronal apoptosis (Fig. 5e). GFAP-positive astrocyte activation was significantly decreased in Nox1 shRNAexpressing rats (Fig. 5f).

Nox1 knockdown improved the survival and differentiation of progenitor
cells in the SVZ after cerebral ischemia
Sham-operated rats and rats with MCAO received an injection of the cell proliferation marker
BrdU (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, twice daily) from days 5 to 14. Rats were killed on days 14
or 28. Most BrdU-positive (BrdU+) cells were localized to the SVZ (Fig. 6a). The number of
BrdU+ cells was seen to be increased on postischemic day 14 in the rat SVZ and the peri-infarct
resions (Fig. 6b). The increase was statistically significant (Fig. 6a and c). BrdU incorporation
could also reflect a DNA repair process, as distinct from cell proliferation. We therefore determined immunoreactivity for Ki67, a nuclear protein closely associated with cell mitosis [8].
Immunohistochemistry for Ki67 showed a similar distribution and increase to BrdU immunoreactivity (Fig. 6a and c). The BrdU+/Ki67+ cells were on average 90 ± 12.5% of all BrdU+ cells
(Fig. 6c). We also found that the expression of Ki67 and uptake of BrdU was similarly regulated
and colocalized the ipsilateral SVZ and the peri-infarct regions of MCAO rats treated with scb
shRNA/AAV or Nox1 shRNA/AAV particles before MCAO (Fig. 6a and c). To determine the
effect of Nox on ischemia-induced cell proliferation, BrdU and doublecortin (DCX) double-labeling methods were used to detect cells proliferating in the ipsilateral SVZ of rats at 14 days
after MCAO-induced ischemia. The BrdU- and DCX-positive cells were increased in the

ipsilateral SVZ following cerebral ischemia compared with the contralateral SVZ following
MCAO. No significant difference in the number of BrdU+ cells in the ipsilateral SVZ was observed between the rats treated with scbRNA and rats treated with Nox1 shRNA before MCAO
(Fig. 7). However, the number of BrdU+ and DCX+ double-labeled cells in the ipsilateral periinfarct region of rats treated with Nox1 shRNA was significantly increased compared with rats
treated with scbRNA before MCAO (Fig. 8). These findings suggest that Nox1 knockdown increased the localization of ischemia-induced progenitor neurons in the MCAO
ischemic region.
Next, to examine the effect of Nox1 on the differentiation of progenitor cells and the survival of newborn cells in ischemia, BrdU- and NeuN-labeling methods, and BrdU- and active caspase-3-labeling methods were used to detect differentiated cells and apoptotic newborn cells,
respectively, in the ipsilateral peri-infarct regions in ischemic rats at 4 w after MCAO. The
number of BrdU and NeuN double-labeled cells in the ipsilateral peri-infarct region of rats
treated with Nox1 shRNA was significantly increased compared with rats treated with scbRNA
before MCAO (Fig. 8).
The number of BrdU and active caspase-3 double-labeled cells in the peri-infarct region of
rats treated with Nox1 shRNA was significantly decreased in comparison with rats treated with
scbRNA before MCAO (Fig. 9a and b).
These results indicate that Nox1 knockdown increases newborn cell survival and promotes
progenitor cell differentiation into mature neurons in the MCAO ischemic region.

Discussion
In the present study, we showed that Nox1 mediates oxidative stress, neuronal death, and activation of astrocytes in rats with MCAO. We demonstrated, for the first time to our knowledge,
that the expression of the Nox1 isoform is elevated in the peri-infarct region after stroke.
The peri-infarct region is only viable for a limited time, but as long as energy metabolism
and membrane function are preserved, the injury is fundamentally reversible. Changes in the
viability of the peri-infarct region are therefore of critical importance to assess the progression
of tissue damage and to determine the window of opportunity for therapeutic interventions
[23].
Accumulation of the Nox1 complex in the peri-infarct region, production of ROS, and nuclear DNA damage were all found in neurons of the I/R-injured brain. These findings indicate
that Nox1-mediated oxidative damage may serve as a critical upstream process in neurodegeneration of the peri-infarct region.
There is increasing evidence that generation of ROS in the CNS involves the Nox family of
NADPH oxidases [24]. Nox enzymes are not restricted to microglia (i.e. brain phagocytes), but
are also expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and the neurovascular system. Nox enzymes are involved in CNS development, neural stem cell biology, and the function of mature neurons.
While Nox2 appears to be a major source of pathological oxidative stress in the CNS, other
Nox isoforms might also be of importance, e.g. Nox4 in stroke [24].
A first proof of concept for Nox2 as a principal source of ROS in stroke was provided in
1997 when Walder et al. showed strong protection for the damage of transient MCAO in
Nox2-deficient mice [25], raising strong interest in targeting Nox2 as a potential therapy for
stroke. Since then, this paradigm has been tested in numerous models using small molecules
and Nox1-, Nox2-, and Nox4-deficient mice, resulting in different outcomes and leading to disputes whether Nox2 [26] or Nox4 [7] isoform is the key pharmacological target for stroke [24].
Although few studies have reported a role for Nox1 in experimental stroke, we recently reported a moderate reduction in lesion volume and cerebral edema, and ameliorated BBB

leakage with relatively mild ischemic damage after the knockout of Nox1 [9]. Studies examining the role of Nox2 have demonstrated activation via N-methly-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [24, 27, 28]. However, the role of neuronal Nox1 activation in stroke is not well
understood. Mitochondria are involved in Nox1 expression in nonneuronal cells [29–31]. In
serum-deprived 293 cells, mitochondrial ROS at the early phase contributes to Nox1 induction
that is responsible for the later phase of ROS accumulation, culminating in cell death [32].
Studies of osteosarcoma cells with mitochondrial gene knockout (q0) revealed that the inactivation of mitochondrial genes leads to downregulation of Nox1 and that the transfer of wildtype mitochondrial genes can restore Nox1 expression [31]. We found that newly discovered
molecular mechanisms underlie oxidative stress-mediated dopaminergic neuronal death, in
which matrix metalloproteinase 3 activation is a key upstream event that leads to mitochondrial ROS, Nox1 induction and eventual dopaminergic neuronal cell death (data not shown). To
understand these mechanisms better, we need to determine the mechanism of Nox1 activation
and regulation in neuronal damage after stroke.

Our results showed that increased infarction size, neuronal cell death using NeuN+ cell
counts and TUNEL staining, and activation of astrocytes were significantly reduced by Nox1
knockdown in the peri-infarct region. Moreover, AAV-mediated Nox1 knockdown enhanced
functional recovery after MCAO.
Nox1-mediated superoxide generation requires other components, including Rac1 activation, and Noxo1 and Noxa1, which are homologues of p47phox and p67phox, respectively
[33]. Rac1, a small Rho GTPase, is a protein that is important for the activation of Nox1derived superoxide generation [33, 34]. To activate the NADPH oxidase system, activated Rac1
forms a Nox1 enzyme complex in conjunction with Noxo1 and Noxa1 [35]. In the present
study, we found that neurons in the peri-infarct region were equipped with Noxo1 and Noxa1;
moreover, MCAO-mediated Rac1 activation was observed.
Acute brain injury, such as cerebral ischemia, increases the ratio of neurogenesis in both the
SVZ and SGZ of adult rodents [36, 37], which suggests that the activation of neural stem cells
that migrate into lesion regions may be involved in self-repair to compensate for the local cell
loss [37–39]. Unfortunately, most of new neurons in the adult brain are not preserved. Following ischemic stroke, 80% of new neurons die within 2 to 6 w after stroke [40, 41], which indicates that new neurons that originate from precursor cells are susceptible to brain injury [42].
Accordingly, strategies to enhance the differentiation of progenitor cells into neuroblasts and
improve the survival of new neurons after brain injury are beneficial [43]. The survival of new
neurons is dependent on the surrounding milieu, which is prominently altered after cerebral ischemia, usually through the accumulation of inflammatory factors, mitotic factors, and toxins
[44, 45]. Although the mechanism remains unclear, the accumulation of inflammatory factors
and toxins has recently been proposed to be part of the neurogenic environment that affects
progenitor cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival [37]. Therefore, we investigated the
effect of Nox1 knockdown on progenitor cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival in the
peri-infarct region. We found that Nox1 knockdown improved the survival and differentiation
of progenitor cells in the SVZ after cerebral ischemia.

Role of Nox1 in the Stroke

Our data suggest that Nox1 may be involved in oxidative stress and neuronal death in the
peri-infarct region after stroke. Moreover, inhibition of Nox1 in the peri-infarct region can improve neurological dysfunction and enhance the survival of new neurons in the peri-infarct region by inhibiting apoptosis and downregulation of superoxide generation after transient
cerebral ischemia in rats. Therefore, Nox1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for brain
repair after stroke.
