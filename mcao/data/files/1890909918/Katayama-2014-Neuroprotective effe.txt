Introduction

Cerebral ischemia often kills or disables its victims. Neuroprotective therapy for acute cerebral ischemia is crucial for
salvaging the ischemic penumbra and has become essential
with the increasing use of thrombolysis (Pancioli et al., 2008)
and mechanical clot removal (Smith et al., 2005). Most of the
neuroprotective compounds so far developed for ischemic
damage are clinically ineffective for acute stroke patients.
The free radical scavenger NXY-059 was also ineffective for
acute stroke patients in SAINT (Shuaib et al., 2007). Only one
free radical scavenger, edaravone, has been used clinically for
neuroprotection in Japan (The Edaravone Acute Brain
Infarction Study Group, 2003). The advent of new neuroprotective agents is urgently awaited.
Erythromycin (EM), meanwhile, has long been used as a
macrolide antibiotic with few side effects. Pretreatment with
clinical doses of erythromycin confers tolerance against
hypoxia in vitro and cerebral ischemia in vivo (Huber et al.,
1999; Brambrink et al., 2006; Koerner et al., 2007).
This macrolide also inﬂuences inﬂammatory mechanisms
in different organ systems (Labro and Abdelghaffar, 2001;
Morikawa et al., 2002).
We believe that EM holds great promise as a neuroprotective agent for acute ischemic damages.
To elucidate the neuroprotective effect of EM on neuronal damage, we administered the agent for transient focal
ischemia using rats and cultured neuronal cells subjected
to OGD.

Effect of EM in transient focal ischemia

2.1.1.

Physiological variables

There were no signiﬁcant differences in pH, pCO2, pO2, rectal
temperature (RT), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), or
blood glucose (BG) between the vehicle- and EM-treated
groups after 24- or 72-h reperfusion, before or during MCAO
(45 min after MCAO), or just before reperfusion (90 min after
MCAO) (Table 1).

2.1.2.

MRI-CBF

MCA occlusion reduced CBF in the territory supplied by the
ipsilateral MCA at 90 min after MCA occlusion in both groups.
The areas of decreased CBF were calculated based on the
ipsilateral CBF, which was less than 60% of the mean value
of the contralateral hemisphere. The mean area of the
ipsilateral CBF reduction did not signiﬁcantly differ between
the vehicle and EM groups after 24 h (56.179.0 mm2 (n¼ 6) vs
53.8715.4 mm2 (n ¼6)) (Fig. 1) or 72 h of reperfusion (41.57
4.8 mm2 (n ¼5) vs 45.4712.5 mm2 (n¼ 5)). Hence, EM administration did not affect the CBF at 90 min.

2.1.3.

Infarct volume and edema index

After 24 h of reperfusion, the infarct volume was signiﬁcantly
smaller in the EM-treated group (n¼ 6) than in the vehicletreated group (n ¼6) (83728.0 mm3 vs 171.6744.8 mm3; 48.4%
reduction vs vehicle mean; po0.01) (Fig. 2A). After 72 h, the

vehicle groups exhibited 4-HNE-positive cells in the cortex of
the boundary area of the ipsilateral hemisphere, and staining
was mainly present in the neuronal cell bodies. The number
of 4-HNE-positive cells after 24 h was signiﬁcantly smaller in
the EM group than in the vehicle group (198.3731.8 vs
52.9718.7/1.33 mm2, po0.01) (Fig. 4A).

2.1.5.2. Oxidative DNA damage. DNA oxidative damage
was assessed by immunohistochemical staining using an
8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) antibody. No 8-OHdGpositive cells were found in the contralateral hemisphere
(data not shown). After 24 h of reperfusion, a signiﬁcant
number of 8-OHdG-positive cells were observed in the cortex
of the boundary area of the ipsilateral hemisphere and 8OHdG immunoreactivity was prominent in neuronal nuclei.
The EM group had signiﬁcantly fewer 8-OHdG-positive cells in
the boundary area after 24 h, and neuronal nuclei showed a
weakly positive immunoreactivity for 8-OHdG (231.1734.8 vs
104.1719.0/1.33 mm2, po0.01; Fig. 4B).

2.1.5.3. Microglial activation. Microglial activation was estimated by immunohistochemical staining using an ionized
calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) antibody. No
microglial cells were detected in the contralateral hemisphere (data not shown). After 24 h of reperfusion, Iba-1positive microglia were increased in the vehicle group and
signiﬁcantly reduced in the EM group (313.1718.4 vs
140.4740.0/1.33 mm2, po0.01; Fig. 4C).
2.1.5.4. TNF-α expression. Immunohistochemical staining for
the proinﬂammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-α) was performed using an anti TNF-α antibody. No
TNF-α immunoreactivity was observed in the contralateral
hemisphere (data not shown). After 24 h of reperfusion, a
signiﬁcant number of TNF-α-expressing cells were observed
around the boundary of the ipsilateral hemisphere in the
vehicle group. The number of TNF-α-positive cells in the EM
group after 24 h was signiﬁcantly lower (249.7754.2 vs
50.1721.0/1.33 mm2, po0.01; Fig. 4D).

Fig. 3 shows the neurological scores at 24 and 72 h after
MCAO. At 24 h, the average hemiplegia and abnormal posture
scores were 2.1770.41 and 1.8370.41 in the vehicle group
(n ¼6) and 1.1770.14 and 1.0070.63 in the EM-treated group
(n ¼6). EM signiﬁcantly improved hemiplegia (po0.01) and
abnormal posture scores (po0.05).
At 72 h, the average hemiplegia and abnormal posture scores
were 2.8070.45 and 2.4070.55 in the vehicle group (n¼5) and
1.8070.45 and 1.2070.45 in the EM-treated group (n¼5). EM
signiﬁcantly improved both parameters (po0.01).

Cell viability after OGD

After terminating OGD by adding oxygen and glucose
(re-oxygenation), the medium was sampled for lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) release as a measure of cell injury.
Three hours of OGD resulted in 83.2% cell death in the rat
cortical neurons (Fig. 5A). While 10 μM of EM offered no
protection, 100 μM of EM signiﬁcantly reduced cell death by
35.9% after OGD (Fig. 5A).

2.2.2.

Viability testing

Most cortical neurons in the control group were viable. At
24 h after re-oxygenation, the neuronal viability greatly
decreased. The neurons treated with the larger EM dose
(100 μM), however, were still viable when stained with calcein
AM. The EM-treated neurons also had less ethidium
homodimer-1 (EthD-1)-stained cells, suggesting that EM protects against OGD injury (Fig. 5B).

Discussion

EM administered just after cerebral ischemia reduced the
infarct and edema index and improved functional recovery
without affecting CBF measured at 90 min after ischemia.
The agent also suppressed post-ischemic lipid peroxidation
products and oxidative DNA damage, reduced the inﬂammatory process, and subsequently protected the brain against
ischemia-reperfusion injury. EM also signiﬁcantly improved
the viability of cultured neuronal cells in vitro after OGD. EM
clearly exhibited neuroprotective effects against ischemiareperfusion injury and OGD.

EM may suppress the immunological response that mediates damage after cerebral ischemia (Iadecola and
Alexander, 2001; Boutin et al., 2001; Danton and Dietrich,
2003) by altering several inﬂammatory mechanisms (Labro
and Abdelghaffar, 2001; Morikawa et al., 2002; Azuma et al.,
1998; Li et al., 2002).
Our study animals received a 50 mg/kg dose subcutaneously just after commencing 90-min MCAO followed by
reperfusion. Fifty mg/kg was the most effective out of three
doses tested beforehand: 5, 10, or 50 mg/kg. Likewise, the
timing of the administration of 50 mg/kg EM, namely, immediately after ischemia induction, was determined to be
optimal versus administration at 60 min and 90 min.

re-oxygenation. The stronger dose of 100 μm EM reduced LDH release by about half compared with the OGD group without EM
treatment, whereas the weaker dose of 10 μm EM showed no effect in reducing the release (A). *po0.05 compared with each

Ischemic brain injury often causes irreversible brain
damage. The cascade of events leading to neuronal injury
and death after ischemia includes the release of free radicals,
inﬂammation, apoptosis and excitotoxicity. Especially, free
radicals generated during ischemia play an important role in
neuronal damage (Kinouchi et al., 1991; Kitagawa et al., 1990).
In this study we investigated the accumulation of lipid
membrane peroxidation products using an antibody against
HNE-modiﬁed proteins. The major aldehyde, 4-HNE, is produced by the peroxidation of cellular membrane lipids and
mediates oxidative stress-induced cell death in many cell
types (Esterbauer et al., 1991; Toyokuni et al., 1994). The 4-HNE
aldehyde is a very reliable index of free-radical-induced lipid
peroxidation after ischemic injury (Yoshino et al., 1997). EM
signiﬁcantly suppressed the level of HNE-modiﬁed protein in
the ischemic penumbra after 24 h of reperfusion. EM also
signiﬁcantly attenuated the increase in 8-OHdG immunoreactivity in the ischemic penumbra after 24 h of reperfusion.
Various free-radical-producing agents promote 8-OHdG accumulation by hydroxylating deoxyguanosine residues in DNA.
Marked increases in 8-OHdG trigger apoptotic cell death after
cerebral ischemia (Nagayama et al., 2000). Our vehicle group
thus exhibited signiﬁcant increases in lipid peroxidation and
DNA hydroxylation products after 24 h, while our EM group
did not. The EM antioxidant effect is clearly mediated
through the suppression of lipid peroxidation and oxidative
DNA damage.
Focal ischemia elicits a profound inﬂammatory response
that may contribute to cell death. Increasing evidence suggests that post-ischemic inﬂammation involving microglia
contributes to ischemic damage (Nito et al., 2011; Iadecola and
Alexander, 2001; Boutin et al., 2001; Chao et al., 1992; Suda
et al., 2011). Herein we further show EM inhibits perifocal

microglial activation, possibly leading to decreased damage.
Activated microglial cells produce ROS and NO, which can
damage neuronal cells (Chao et al., 1992). Although the
protective mechanisms of EM are complex, reduction of free
radical generation from microglial products might be considered to be one of such mechanisms.
When a tissue suffers ischemia and reperfusion, proinﬂammatory cytokines produced by inﬂammatory cells can
trigger adhesion of circulating neutrophils to endothelial cells
and generation of ROS that enhances neutrophil inﬁltration
and results in further ischemic injury (Suda et al., 2011). We,
therefore, have chosen to measure the pro-inﬂammatory
cytokine TNF-α because this cytokine mediates infarct enlargement (Nito et al., 2011; Barone et al., 1997; Zawadzka and
Kaminska, 2004).
Our data indicated that EM reduced TNF-α in the perifocal
ischemic area after 24 h of ischemia. The neuroprotective
effect of EM may partly derive from an anti-inﬂammatory
effect mediated by the suppression of microglial activity and
inhibition of TNF-α.
In vitro study EM improved the viability of the cultured
neuronal cells after OGD. EM inhibits mitochondrial protein
synthesis (Ibrahim and Beattie, 1973; Doersen and Stanbridge,
1982; Karbowski et al., 1997) and may reduce cell respiration
by reducing the production of enzymes necessary for optimal
function of the respiratory chain (Karbowski et al., 1997;
Pious and Hawley, 1972). EM can also bolster tolerance
against cerebral ischemia and reprogram the transcriptional
response to ischemia (Brambrink et al., 2006; Koerner et al.,
2007). These properties may relate to the neuroprotective
effect of EM against OGD, and the anti-oxidant and antiinﬂammatory actions shown in our transient ischemia model
may improve cell viability.

brain research 1588 (2014) 159–167

Nevertheless, the molecules and pathways that are activated by EM treatment and that mediate changes in oxidative
stress and post-ischemic inﬂammation need further
clariﬁcation.
In summary, our data suggest that EM can protect against
cerebral ischemia and OGD insults by alleviating inﬂammation
and reducing oxidant stress. EM may hold promise as a
neuroprotective agent for acute ischemic stroke.

Experimental procedure

All experimental protocols were approved by our Institutional
Committee on Animal Research (Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School) and conducted in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care
and use of laboratory animals.

4.1.

Effect of EM in transient focal ischemia

4.1.1.

Focal cerebral ischemia

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (8-week-old, 250–300 g) purchased
from Sankyo Labo Service (Tokyo, Japan) were used. After the
animals were fasted overnight with free access to tap water,
anesthesia was induced with 5% halothane and maintained
with 1% halothane in a mixture of 70% N2O, 30% O2 under
spontaneous breathing. A polyethylene PE-50 catheter was
inserted into the tail artery to monitor mean arterial blood
pressure and sample blood. Blood gases and blood glucose
were measured just before and during ischemia. The animals
were subjected to 90 min of focal cerebral ischemia followed
by 24 or 72 h of reperfusion using an established intraluminal
suture technique (Arii et al., 2001; Nito et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, the
left common, internal, and external carotid arteries were
exposed through a midline cervical incision, and the common
and external carotid arteries were doubly ligated using 4-0
silk sutures. The left MCA was occluded by inserting a
silicone rubber-coated 4-0 nylon thread through the left
internal carotid artery for 90 min, and reperfusion was
achieved by withdrawing the thread.

4.1.2.

Experimental groups

The animals were randomly divided into EM-treated (n¼ 5–6)
and vehicle-treated groups (n¼5–6). The two groups respectively received 50 mg/kg of EM and saline subcutaneously just
after the cerebral ischemia was induced. Erythromycin lactobionate (EM, U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention, USA) was dissolved to a 30 mg/ml concentration with physiological saline.
The body temperature was maintained at 37 1C with a
heating pad during the surgery for MCAO. Blood samples
were collected from the tail artery before and during MCAO
and just before reperfusion, for measurement of pH, pO2, and
pCO2. The infarct volume and edema index were measured
and neurological symptoms were assessed in the same
animals. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted
using different animals.

4.1.3.

Evaluation of cerebral blood ﬂow

To conﬁrm the MCA occlusion and reduction of cerebral blood
ﬂow (CBF), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiments

165

were performed using a 7 T/18-cm horizontal magnet (Magnex Scientiﬁc, Abingdon, UK) with a Varian Unity-INOVA-300
(Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) system equipped with an actively
shielded gradient and 6-cm internal diameter quadrature
birdcage coil. Cerebral perfusion images at the level of the
bregma were obtained at 90 min post-occlusion using a
continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) method (Williams
et al., 1992) modiﬁed with a centrally encoded variable-tipangle gradient echo (VTE-GE) technique (Ewing et al., 2003).
Inﬂowing protons of the arterial blood were labeled by
adiabatic inversion with an axial gradient of 74.5 kHz/mm
and a continuous RF transmission of 0.6 kHz at a frequency
offset of 79 kHz (inversion plane 20 mm below the imaging
plane). GE parameters were as follows: repetition time (TR),
ﬁve milliseconds; echo time, three milliseconds; ﬁeld of view,
50  50 mm; slice thickness, 2 mm; matrix size, 128  64.
Forty-eight pairs of images were produced with and without
the inversion of inﬂowing protons and summed to improve
the signal-to-noise ratio.
The NMR images were manipulated using MR vision
software (MR Vision Co., Menlo Park, CA) on a Blade1000
workstation (Sun Microsystems, Milpitas, CA).

4.1.4.

Measurement of infarct volume and edema index

The animals were anesthetized and decapitated at 24 and
72 h after reperfusion. Coronal Section (2-mm-thick) were
stained by immersion in 2% TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride) at 37 1C and ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin overnight. The area of the ischemic lesion measured in each
section was multiplied by the interval thickness using an
image analysis system (National Institute of Health image
software) (Arii et al., 2001; Nito et al., 2001).
The edema index (%) at 24 and 72 h was calculated as
follows: (ipsilateral hemispheric volume contralateral hemispheric volume)  100/contralateral hemispheric volume
(Amemiya et al., 2005).

4.1.5.

Examination of neurological symptoms

Neurological symptoms in several experimental animals
were blindly examined at 24 or 72 h after reperfusion using
a scoring system based on the detection of hemiplegia and
abnormal posture (Yonemori et al., 1998). The ﬂexor response
of the right hindlimb was scored as follows while extending
the limb with round-tipped forceps: 0, normal; 1, slight
deﬁcit; 2, moderate deﬁcit; 3, severe deﬁcit. To assess posture,
and forelimb ﬂexion and body twisting were scored while
suspending the animal by the tail: 0, normal; 1, slight
twisting; 2, marked twisting; or 3, marked twisting and
forelimb ﬂexion.

4.1.6.

Immunohistochemistry

The animals were anesthetized and perfused intracardially
with heparinized saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde.
The brains were removed, postﬁxed in the same solution
overnight at 4 1C, cryoprotected, and rapidly frozen. Frozen
coronal sections were sliced (20 mm), collected on glass slides,
and incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for
30 min to quench endogeneous peroxide activity. After washing in Tris-buffered saline, nonspeciﬁc binding was blocked
with 5% normal bovine serum in Tris-buffered saline. The

166

brain research 1588 (2014) 159–167

sections were incubated overnight at 4 1C with the following
antibodies: a mouse monoclonal antibody against 4-HNE
(4-HNE; 50:1; Japan Institute For the Control of Aging [JIFCA],
Shizuoka, Japan) to assess lipid peroxidation; a mouse monoclonal antibody against 8-OHdG (8-OHdG; 50:1; JIFCA) to
detect oxidative DNA damage; a rabbit polyclonal antibody
against Iba-1 (Iba-1; 500:1; Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
Osaka, Japan) as a marker of active microglia; and a goat
polyclonal antibody against TNF-α (TNF-α; 10:1; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). The sections were then incubated with secondary antibodies, followed by avidin-biotin-peroxide complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min. The
number of stained cells per 1.33 mm2 in the cortex of the
boundary area was counted in four randomly selected microscopic ﬁelds (ECLIPSE E600W; NIKON, Tokyo, Japan) in each
antibody-stained section to calculate the mean value.

4.1.7.

Statistical analysis

The data are expressed as mean7standard deviation. An
unpaired t-test was used to compare differences in physiological variables, relative CBFs, infarct volumes, edema indexes,
and immunochemical assessments. The neurological scores
were analyzed with a nonparametric test (Mann–Whitney Utest). A p-valueo0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Effect of EM on cell viability after OGD

4.2.1.

Primary cortical neuron cultures

Primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared from the
cerebral cortices of 17-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos
by a method described previously with modiﬁcation (Nagai
et al., 2007). After removing olfactory bulbs, meninges, hippocampal formations, and basal ganglia, the cortices were
chopped and incubated in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA for 30 min at
37 1C. After stopping the digestion by adding 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), the suspension was centrifuged at 80 g for 5 min,
the supernatant was removed, the pellet was resuspended in
medium containing 10% FBS, and the cells were dissociated
10–15 times with a P-1000 pipette. After resuspending the
pellet in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with
B-27 (Invitrogen), the cells were plated at a density of 2  105
cells/well on 24-well plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
coated with poly-D-lysine/mouse laminin. The medium was
then changed to Neurobasal medium with B-27 containing
2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin once every three days. At nine days in vitro, the
growth medium was changed to Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 minus antioxidant (Invitrogen). The cultured cells were maintained in a 37 1C humidiﬁed incubator
with 5% CO2 in room air and used for our experiments at
10–12 days.

4.2.2.

OGD and re-oxygenation

After removing and stocking the culture medium, the cells
were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
placed in deoxygenated glucose and serum-free medium
(Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle medium [DMEM] without glucose,
gassed with 95% N2/5% CO2 for 15 min). Oxygenated DMEM
with glucose was used for uninjured controls in a normoxic
incubator. The cells were pretreated with the indicated

concentrations of EM (EM, 0 μM, 10 μM, or 100 μM) (U.S.
Pharmacopeial Convention, USA) or PBS 30 min before OGD
injury. The cultures were incubated at 37 1C in an anaerobic
chamber (MIC-101, Billups-Rothenberg, Inc., Del Mar, CA) in
an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% N2 (O2o0.1%) for 3 h. The
OGD was ended by switching back to the stoched culture
medium and returning the cells to the normoxic chamber.
While the cells in control groups were pretreated with EM in
the same manner (EM, 0 μM, 10 μM or 100 μM) or PBS and were
maintained in a 37 1C humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2 in
room air atmosphere for 24 h.

4.2.3.

LDH assay

Cell death was determined at 24 h after re-oxygenation in the
normoxic incubator by measuring LDH release using a LDH
assay kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The medium
was sampled for four independent wells at 24 h after
re-oxygenation. Neurons were then frozen/thawed to provide
the maximum LDH release values (full-kill numbers).
The percentage of cell death (% of LDH release) was calculated by dividing the experimental time point by the full-kill
values  100.

4.2.4.

Live and dead cell assay

Viability was tested at 24 h after re-oxygenation in the EMtreated cortical neurons. The cell cultures in each sample
were treated for 30–45 min in the dark with 2 mM calcein AM
and 4 mM EthD-1 using a Live/Dead kit (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR). Calcein-AM- and EthD-1-labeled cells were
observed under a ﬂuorescence microscope. Green staining
indicated metabolically active cells, while EthD-1 revealed
both damaged membranes and dead cells. The ﬂuorescence
image was obtained at  200 magniﬁcation.
