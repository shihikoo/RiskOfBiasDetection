Introduction

Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a progressive occlusive cerebrovascular disease that is characterized by bilateral stenoocclusive changes at the terminal portion of the internal
carotid artery (ICA) and an abnormal vascular network at
base of the brain (Suzuki and Takaku, 1969). This abnormal
vascular network is expressed as ‘moyamoya’, a Japanese
expression for something hazy such as a drifting puff of
cigarette smoke. This abnormal angiogenesis may be speciﬁc
to MMD because non-MMD patients exhibiting stenoocclusive changes in the intracranial major arteries rarely
have collateral vessels similar to moyamoya vessels
(Yoshihara et al., 2008; Achrol et al., 2009). Indirect revascularization such as encephalo-duro- arterio-synangiosis is
commonly used in symptomatic MMD patients to achieve
successful angiogenesis and collateral growth in both adults
and children (Endo et al., 1989; Matsushima et al., 1989, 1992).
Few studies have demonstrated the efﬁcacy of indirect
revascularization to enhance collateral angiogenesis in cases
of symptomatic, non-MMD intracranial atherosclerotic arterial stenosis. Komotar and colleagues reported that this
procedure did not promote adequate pial collateral artery
development in patients with atherosclerotic occlusive cerebrovascular diseases (2009).
Although the etiology of MMD remains unknown, recent
ﬁndings suggest the importance of genetic factors (Ikeda
et al., 1999; Inoue et al., 2000; Yamauchi et al., 2000; Sakurai
et al., 2004). A more recent genome-wide association study
identiﬁed the RNF213 gene (RNF213) in the 17q25-ter region as
a susceptibility gene for MMD (Kamada et al., 2011; Liu et al.,
2011; Wu et al., 2012). We previously reported that a singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of c.14576 G4A in RNF213
was detected in 95% of familial MMDs and 79% of sporadic
cases in Japan (Kamada et al., 2011). However, the mechanism by which the SNP in RNF213 reads to MMD remains

311

unknown. We hypothesized that SNP in RNF213 may be
related to abnormal angiogenesis under ischemic conditions.
More recently, SNP of c.14576 G4A in RNF213 was also found
in the non-MMD intracranial major artery stenosis/occlusion
(Miyawaki et al., 2013). Therefore, we investigated angiogenic
responses following transient focal cerebral ischemia in the
chronic stage in homozygous knockouts of RNF213 (RNF213
-/-) and wild-type littermates (Wt). To further evaluate systemic angiogenesis after chronic ischemia, we examined
angiogenesis after permanent hind-limb ischemia at the
chronic stage in RNF213 -/- and Wt.

Results

2.1.
No signiﬁcant difference in infarct volume after
tMCAO
Due to the absence of a favorable animal model for chronic
cerebral ischemia that reproducibly leads to angiogenesis at
the base of the brain, we employed transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (tMCAO), which is generally accepted as an
acute stroke model.
The infarct volume was quantiﬁed in triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) -stained slices, and was 92.9 mm3 in RNF213 -/and 97.7 mm3 in Wt. No signiﬁcant difference was observed
in the infarct volume 48 h after 90 min MCAO between Wt
and RNF213 -/- (p¼ 0.62) (Fig. 1A).

2.2.
No signiﬁcant difference in edema formation after
tMCAO
Cerebral edema was quantiﬁed by water content in the brain,
and was 81.6% in RNF213 -/- and 82.5% in Wt. No signiﬁcant
difference was observed in brain water content 24 h after
90 min MCAO between Wt and RNF213 -/- (p¼ 0.93) (Fig. 1B).

signiﬁcant difference was observed in cerebral parenchymal vascular density between Wt and RNF213-/-.

2.3.

No signiﬁcant difference in angiogenesis after tMCAO

To evaluate angiogenesis in the chronic state after tMCAO,
vascular density in the cerebral parenchyma was evaluated
by immunohistochemistry with an anti-CD31 antibody 28
days after 90 min MCAO (Zhang et al., 2000). Three out of six
mice in both Wt and RNF213 -/- survived 28 days after
tMCAO. The mortality rate in each group was 50%, respectively. Parenchymal vascular density as indicated by CD31positive cells was 81.56 in RNF213 -/- and 82.5 in Wt. No
signiﬁcant difference was observed in cerebral parenchymal
vascular density between Wt and RNF213 -/- (p ¼0.39)
(Fig. 2A–B).

reproducible manner is a hind-limb ischemia model
(Limbourg et al., 2009). Therefore, we adopted this model to
investigate angiogenesis after a chronic ischemic insult. We
measured serial blood ﬂow in the hind-limbs of the same
animals using the LSF system over a period of 28 days. The
average perfusion in each foot was calculated. To correct
variables, including ambient light and temperature, calculated perfusion was expressed as a ratio of the ischemic to
non-ischemic limb. Blood ﬂow in the ischemic limb gradually
recovered with time in both Wt and RNF213 -/- (Fig. 4A–B).
However, the recovery of blood ﬂow was signiﬁcantly better
in RNF213 -/- than in Wt. from 3 to 28 days after ligation
(Fig. 4A–B).

2.4.
No signiﬁcant difference in the expression of proMMP-9 and MMP-9 after tMCAO

2.6.
Ambulatory impairments were milder in RNF213 -/after femoral artery ligation

Gelatin zymography was performed on samples from
ischemic hemispheres to evaluate the level of pro-matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-9 24 h after 90 min
MCAO. pro-MMP-9 expression in the ischemic hemisphere
was elevated after tMCAO in both groups (Fig. 3A). The active
form of MMP-9 was detected in the ischemic hemisphere, but
not in the non-ischemic hemisphere (Fig. 3A). No signiﬁcant
difference was observed in the level of pro-MMP-9 (p¼ 0.84) or
MMP-9 (p ¼0.74) between Wt and RNF213 -/- (Fig. 3A–B).

We also assessed motor function in the ischemic hind-limb
by scoring ambulatory impairments. Motor functions
declined after femoral artery ligation, and improved with
time in Wt and RNF213 -/- (Fig. 5B). The ambulatory impairment score was signiﬁcantly better in RNF213 -/- (score 0.43)
than in Wt. (score 1.86) three days after ligation (po0.001). It
was also signiﬁcantly better in RNF213 -/- (score 0.14) than in
Wt. (score 1.00) seven days after ligation (po0.01) (Fig. 5B).

2.5.
Blood ﬂow recovered better in RNF213 -/- after
femoral artery ligation
No signiﬁcant differences were observed in the responses to
transient cerebral ischemia between Wt and RNF213 -/-, as
described above. There was no chronic cerebral ischemia
model that was suitable for investigating angiogenic
responses in mice. One of the ideal animal models to mimic
human ischemic disease and evaluate angiogenesis in a

Angiogenesis was enhanced in RNF213 -/- after
femoral artery ligation
Angiogenesis after hind-limb ischemia was evaluated by
immunohistochemistry in the GC muscle with the antiCD31 antibody 28 days after the induction of ischemia
(Limbourg et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2012; Tashiro et al., 2012).
The density of CD31-positive cells was signiﬁcantly higher in
RNF213 -/- (170.8 cells) than in Wt. (117.0 cells) (po0.05),
which indicated that angiogenesis in the GC muscle was

enhanced more in RNF213 -/- than in Wt. after chronic hindlimb ischemia (Fig. 6A–B). We also performed immunohistochemistry with an anti-CD34 antibody and anti-CD133 antibody to evaluate the angiogenesis as well as stem cell
expression (Fig. 6C), and the results were completely in
accordance with that of CD31.

2.8.
No signiﬁcant difference in pro-MMP-9 expression
after femoral artery ligation
The expression of pro-MMP-9 three days after femoral artery
ligation was assessed by zymography. It increased after hindlimb ischemia in both groups, while the active form of MMP-9
was not detected even after ischemia induction (Fig. 7A). No
signiﬁcant difference was observed in the level of pro-MMP-9
between Wt and RNF213 -/- (p ¼0.275) (Fig. 7A–B).

Discussion

In the present study, we showed that angiogenesis under
chronic ischemic conditions was signiﬁcantly better in mice
lacking the RNF213 gene than in Wt in the hind-limb ischemia model. Previous studies attempted to examine the role of
RNF213 in angiogenesis by using an in vitro model of MMD
(Hitomi et al., 2013); however, our study is the ﬁrst to examine
the contribution of the RNF213 abnormality to angiogenic

responses in vivo. Based on our results, it is conceivable that
the SNP of c.14576 G4A in RNF213 in patients may lead to the
loss of RNF213 function, and could thereby enhance the
development of abnormal vascular networks after chronic
ischemia.
In our previous study, we showed that RNF213 -/- grew
normally until 64 weeks after birth, and did not develop the
pathological characteristics of MMD including stenoocclusive changes in the ICA and an abnormal vascular
network at the base of the brain under normal physiological
conditions (Sonobe et al., 2014). We also demonstrated that
both the intima and medial layers of the CCA were signiﬁcantly thinner in RNF213 -/- than in Wt 14 days after CCA
ligation, which suggested that the RNF213 abnormality may
affect vascular wall remodeling in the carotid arteries under
ischemic conditions, thereby leading to the characteristic
features of MMD (Sonobe et al., 2014). Medial layer thinness,
as found in this study, is known to be one of the intrinsic
histopathological characteristics of MMD (Oka et al., 1981;
Takagi et al., 2007b; Research Committee on the Pathology
and Treatment of Spontaneous Occlusion of the Circle of
Willis, 2012), and the thinness of the entire vascular wall
structure may even be considered to reﬂect the early morphological changes of MMD, based on the most recent
constrictive remodeling theory of MMD as described by
Kaku et al., 2012. However, the mechanism by which the
RNF213 abnormality affects the development of abnormal

vascular networks, the so-called ‘moyamoya vessels’, in MMD
has not yet been determined.
The development of moyamoya vessels is generally considered to be an abnormal angiogenic response to chronic
ischemia due to bilateral ICA steno-occlusive changes in
MMD (Research Committee on the Pathology and Treatment
of Spontaneous Occlusion of the Circle of Willis, 2012). Thus,
we compared angiogenic responses to ischemic insults
between RNF213 -/- and Wt in the present study. We have

previously attempted to establish chronic brain hypoperfusion model by bilateral ICA occlusion, but it was the case of
CD1 strain mice instead of C57BL/6 (Murakami et al., 1998).
Regarding C57 BL/6 background mice used in this study, we
failed to establish favorable chronic brain hypoperfusion
model. In fact, it was reported that C57 BL/6 strain is most
susceptible to cerebral ischemia following bilateral carotid
artery occlusion, and showed extremely high mortality rate
(Yang et al., 1997). Due to the absence of a favorable mice

of which were completely in accordance with the result of CD31.

model of chronic cerebral ischemia that reproducibly leads to
angiogenesis at the base of the brain, we employed two types
of ischemia models in mice; tMCAO and the hind-limb
ischemia model by femoral artery ligation. Although tMCAO
is an acute ischemia model, we evaluated angiogenic
responses at the base of the brain, which is the vascular
territory of ischemia in this model, in the chronic state.
Although permanent MCAO could be the alternative model
in light of its chronic ischemic pathology in the ische-

mic penumbra of long-term survivors, mortality rate of
permanent MCAO in C57BL/6 mice is extremely high and
we ﬁnally employed tMCAO model. The failure to detect any
signiﬁcant difference in angiogenesis between RNF213 -/- and
Wt could be attributed to the discrepancy between the tMCAO
model and MMD in clinical settings, which is a chronic and
progressive disease. We then used the hind-limb ischemia
model by femoral artery ligation as an established model of
chronic ischemia, which is known to be an animal model

ideal for mimicking human occlusive artery disease and
investigating angiogenesis (Limbourg et al., 2009). In this
model, angiogenesis and blood ﬂow recovery after femoral
artery ligation were both signiﬁcantly better in RNF213-/than in Wt. Furthermore, ambulatory impairments in the
ischemic hind-limb were signiﬁcantly milder in RNF213 -/than in Wt three and seven days after ligation.
Regarding in vitro culture studies, Kim and colleagues
reported that tube formation by circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from MMD patients was less in an in vitro
assay of angiogenic activity (Kim et al., 2010). Hitomi and
colleagues demonstrated that tube formation in induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from the vascular
endothelial cells of MMD patients was less in vitro (2013).
They also showed that the overexpression of RNF213 R4810K
alleles inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Hitomi et al., 2013). These ﬁndings were inconsistent with the results of the present study
because we found that the target disruption of RNF213 in
mice resulted in enhanced angiogenesis in vivo under
ischemic conditions. The following reasons may explain the
conﬂicting results observed between ours and previous
in vitro studies. Firstly, we used an in vivo model under the
pathological condition of ischemia; thus, various biological
backgrounds including immune responses mediated by blood

cells should have participated in our system. RNF213 is
known to be markedly expressed in blood cells and the
spleen, which again suggested the contribution of the
immune system in the present study (Kamada et al., 2011).
Furthermore, the discrepancy between the angiogenic assay
in vitro and that in vivo was suggested by Hitomi and
colleagues (2013). Interactions between endothelial cells
(ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (Milliat
et al., 2006), blood cells, and others are necessary for angiogenesis in the living body. Thus, our in vivo model is more
likely to reﬂect pathophysiological angiogenesis in patients
with MMD.
To further clarify the mechanism underlying enhanced
angiogenesis after chronic ischemia in RNF213 -/-, we compared the expression of the extracellular matrix protein,
MMP-9 between RNF213 -/- and Wt because the expression
of MMP-9 was previously shown to be increased in patients
with MMD (Fujimura et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2010), and MMP-9
is also known to participate in angiogenesis under various
pathophysiological conditions (Kaczmarek, 2013; Lei et al.,
2013). Furthermore, MMP-9 is attracting attention because it
could be a therapeutic target during the postoperative period;
elevated MMP-9 levels in the acute phase after revascularization surgery have been suggested to affect blood brain barrier
impermeability, subsequently leading to cerebral hyperperfusion as a surgical complication (Fujimura et al., 2014). In the
present study, no signiﬁcant difference was observed in the
expression of MMP-9 under ischemic conditions between
RNF213 -/- and Wt; therefore, it is conceivable that enhanced
angiogenesis in RNF213-/- could be mediated by an MMP-9independent pathway. A further evaluation of other angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factors
and its receptors is necessary to answer this critical question.
Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that the
increased expression of MMP-9 in blood cells may affect
angiogenic responses in RNF213 -/-, and a further evaluation
including the immune system in RNF213-/- may identify the
underlying mechanisms for enhanced angiogenesis in mice
lacking RNF213, a susceptibility gene for MMD.

Conclusion

Angiogenesis was enhanced in mice lacking RNF213 after
chronic hind-limb ischemia, which suggested the potential
role of the RNF213 gene abnormality in the development of
abnormal vascular networks in chronic ischemia.

Experimental procedures

5.1.

Generation of RNF213 knockout mice

We generated RNF213 knockout mice by deleting exon 32 of
RNF213 with the Cre/loxP system as previously described
(Kamada et al., 2011). Heterozygous male and female mice
were bred to produce homozygous offspring (RNF213 -/-).
Genotyping was performed by PCR using speciﬁc primers to
exon 32 (Kamada et al., 2011).

brain research 1594 (2015) 310–320

5.2.

Experimental animals

Male RNF213 -/- and wild-type littermates (Wt) were used in
accordance with the National Institute of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 8023, revised 1996). All procedures were approved by the animal
care facility of Tohoku University Graduate School of
Medicine.

5.3.

Focal cerebral ischemia

Eight- to ten-week-old male RNF213 -/- and Wt. were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)
by the intraluminal suture technique. Mice were anesthetized
with 1.3 to 1.5% isoﬂuorane in 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous
oxide and breathed spontaneously. Rectal temperature during all surgical procedures was maintained at 3770.5 1C using
a feedback-regulated heating pad (BWT- 100, Bio Research
Center, Nagoya, Japan). The mouse was placed a supine
position, the neck was incised at the midline between the
manubrium and the jaw, and the left common carotid artery
(CCA) was carefully separated from the vagus nerve. The
superior thyroid artery was cauterized and cut. The external
carotid artery (ECA) was ligated with a 7-0 nylon suture near
its bifurcation into the lingual and maxillary arteries and
cauterized distally to the suture. The occipital artery was
cauterized and cut. The pterygopalatine artery was then
exposed and isolated. A collar suture at the origin of the
ECA was prepared using a 6-0 silk suture, the ICA was closed
using a vascular clip (MH-1–20, BEAR Medic, Tokyo, Japan),
and the CCA was temporarily ligated with a 7-0 nylon suture.
A silicon-coated 6-0 nylon monoﬁlament (602323PK5Re, Doccol, Redlands, CA, USA) was introduced into the arteriotomy
hole in the ECA and was advanced into the CCA bifurcation.
After removing the vascular clip and cutting the ECA, the
suture was advanced distally into the ICA. Once the tip of the
inserted suture reached the ICA, the collar suture of the ECA
was tightened to avoid bleeding from the arteriotomy hole,
and the suture of the CCA was unfastened to restore blood
ﬂow from the CCA. The intraluminal suture was inserted into
the ICA 9.070.5 mm from the CCA bifurcation until mild
resistance was felt. The collar suture of the ECA stump was
tightened securely around the inserted ﬁlament. The wound
was closed with 6-0 nylon sutures, and the intraluminal
suture was hidden in the wound. The mouse was then placed
in a prone position and ﬁxed in a head holder (SG-4 N,
Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Its scalp was shaved and cut with
surgical scissors to expose the thin skull over the bilateral
cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. The surface of the skull
was covered with a slipcover over a thin layer of saline to
prevent drying. We recorded cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) values
through the intact skull for 20 s using laser speckle ﬂowmetry
(LSF) (OMEGAZONE, Omegawave, Tokyo, Japan) and conﬁrmed decreases in the CBF value in the MCA territory. The
mouse was then allowed to regain consciousness. The mouse
was re-anesthetized and ﬁxed in the head holder in a prone
position, and the CBF value was recorded. Mice in which CBF
values were spontaneously restored were excluded from
further experiments. The mouse was then placed again in a
supine position and the cervical wound was reopened. The

317

intraluminal suture was withdrawn gently and slowly to
achieve reperfusion 90 min after the induction of ischemia
and the ECA was ligated with the collar suture. The mouse
was awakened to allow for a survival period.

5.4.

Infarction volume after tMCAO

The infarction volume after tMCAO was measured in 14 mice
(Wt, n ¼7; RNF213 -/-, n¼ 7). Mice were given an overdose of
isoﬂurane 48 h after 90 min MCAO, and then subjected to the
transcardiac perfusion of cold saline. Brains were removed
immediately and cut into 5 serial 2-mm-thick coronal sections. These sections were incubated in 1% solution of 2, 3, 5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (17779-10XX10MLML-FF,
Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Mo, USA) for 10 min at 37 1C. Images
were captured using a digital camera (GR DIGITAL III, 173240,
Ricoh, Tokyo, Japan). Unstained areas were measured on
TTC-stained sections as the infarct volume by Image J,
version 1.46r (National Institutes of Health).

5.5.

Brain water content after tMCAO

Brain water content was examined to assess the extent of
cerebral edema after tMCAO. Ten mice were evaluated (Wt,
n¼ 5; RNF213-/-, n¼ 5). Water content in each hemisphere was
measured by the dry-wet method as previously described
(Naruse et al., 1991). Mice were given an overdose of isoﬂurane 24 h after 90 min MCAO, and the brains were removed
immediately. The hemispheres were weighed to obtain the
wet and dry weights before and after drying at 100 1C for 48 h.
Brain water content was calculated as 100%  (wet weight dry weight) / wet weight.

5.6.
Evaluation of angiogenesis by immunohistochemical
analysis of CD31
Mice surviving until 28 days after 90 min MCAO were given an
overdose of isoﬂurane and subjected to the transcardiac
perfusion of cold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
(PFA). After ﬁxation, the brain was removed and embedded in
O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek Japan, Tokyo,
Japan), and then frozen. Sections were cut in the coronal
plane at a thickness of 7 mm using a cryostat (Tissue-Tek
Cryo3, Sakura Finetek Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The capillaries
were visualized by immunoﬂuorescent staining with an antiCD31 antibody (Puriﬁed anti-mouse CD31 antibody, catalog
no. 102501, BioLegend, CA USA), which stained endothelial
cells. The sections were blocked with 10% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (catalog no. X100500 ML, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with the anti-CD31 antibody
(1:100) overnight at 4 1C. The sections were then washed with
PBS and incubated with secondary biotinylated anti-rat IgG
(Biotinylated Anti-Rat IgG Antibody, catalog no. BA-4000,
Vector Labs, CA, USA) for 30 min, followed by washing in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubation with the
VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Kit (Standard) (catalog no. PK-6100,
Vector Labs, CA, USA). The signal was developed with
Diaminobenzidine (DAB) (catalog no. 347-00904, DOJINDO,
Kumamoto, Japan) and counterstained with hematoxylin.

Gelatin zymography after MCAO

Gelatin zymography was performed on samples from
ischemic hemispheres to evaluate the level of pro-matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-9 24 h after 90 min
MCAO. Mice (Wt, n ¼4; RNF213 -/-, n¼ 3) were given an overdose of isoﬂurane and subjected to the transcardiac perfusion
of cold saline 24 h after reperfusion. Both hemispheres were
rapidly removed and homogenized on ice in 1 ml of lysis
buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM
CaCl2, 0.05% BRIJ-35, 0.02% NaN3, and 1% Triton-X-100.
Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at
4 1C. To analyze the MMP-9 level, protein was extracted from
the tissue as previously described (Fujimura et al., 1999). The
supernatants were recovered and incubated with gelatinsepharose 4B (17-0956-01, GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden)
for 60 min with constant shaking at 4 1C. After incubation, the
samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 2 min. The pellets were
washed with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6,
150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 0.05% BRIJ-35 and 0.02% NaN3.
After a second centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended
in elution buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM
CaCl2, 0.05% BRIJ-35, 0.02% NaN3, 10% dimethylsulfoxide) for
30 min. The samples were subjected to gelatin zymography
with a Gelatin Zymo-Electrophoresis Kit (AK47, Primary Cell,
Hokkaido, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s directions.
Images were captured and analyzed by the ChemiDoc MP
ImageLab PC system (BioRad, CA, USA). The relative intensities of individual intensities were normalized by the value
in a control sample. A non-ischemic hemisphere was adopted
as the control.

5.8.

Hind-limb ischemia model

Ten- to twelve-week-old male Wt and RNF213 -/- were used.
Fourteen mice were subjected to this model (Wt, n¼ 7; RNF213
-/-, n¼ 7). The hind-limb ischemia model was created as
previously described (Coufﬁnhal et al., 1998; Limbourg et al.,
2009; Lu et al., 2012). Mice were anesthetized with 1.3 to 1.5%
isoﬂuorane in 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide and
breathed spontaneously. Rectal temperature during all surgical procedures was maintained at 3770.5 1C using a
feedback-regulated heating pad (BWT-100, Bio Research Center, Nagoya, Japan). After a 5-mm skin incision in the inguinal
region on the left side, the femoral artery was blunt dissected
and separated from the femoral vein and nerve. The femoral
artery was tightly ligated distal to the origin of the deep
branch with a 7-0 nylon suture and ischemia was induced in
the hind-limb. The skin incision was closed by a 6-0 nylon
suture. The mouse was then allowed to regain consciousness.

5.9.

Blood ﬂow analysis in the hind-limbs

Blood ﬂow values in the both legs were recorded for 20 s using
laser speckle ﬂowmetry (LSF) (OMEGAZONE, Omegawave,
Tokyo, Japan) before, immediately after ligation of the

femoral artery, and at the different time points of postoperative days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Since penetration of the
laser beam was low, the majority of signals reﬂected skin
perfusion depending on blood ﬂow in the femoral artery.
During measurements, mice were placed on a heat pad, kept
at 37 1C, anesthetized with 1.3 to 1.5% isoﬂuorane in 30%
oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide, and breathed spontaneously.

5.10.

Ambulatory impairment scoring

The severity of ambulatory impairments was assessed before
ligation of the femoral artery and at the different time points
of postoperative days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. The severity of
ambulatory impairments was evaluated using the following
scoring as described previously (Fig. 5A): 0, normal response
(plantar/toe ﬂexion in response to tail traction); 1, plantar, but
not toe ﬂexion; 2, no plantar or toe ﬂexion; 3, dragging of the
foot; 4, spontaneous movement of the non-ischemic hindlimb (Bosch-Marce et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2012).

5.11.
Immunohistochemistry analysis of the
gastrocnemius muscle
Twenty-eight days after ligation of the femoral artery, all
mice which were subjected to hind-limb ischemia model
were euthanized, and left gastrocnemicus (GC) muscle of
each animal was removed. Frozen sections were made in
the similar procedures as the brain. The sections were
stained immunoﬂuorescently anti-CD31 (Puriﬁed antimouse CD31 Antibody, catalog no. 102501, BioLegend, CA
USA), anti-CD34 (anti-CD34 antibody, catalog no. ab8158,
abcam, Massachusetts, UK) and anti-CD133 (Anti-Mouse
CD133 Puriﬁed, eBioscience, catalog no. 14-1331-80, CA,
USA) antibodies in the similar procedures as the brain with
a little modiﬁcation. Brieﬂy, the sections had to be heated in
the antigen retrieval buffer (Histo VT One, catalog no. 06380,
Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) before blocking with 10% BSA.
Other procedures were same as described above.

5.12.

Gelatin zymography of the gastrocnemius muscle

Gelatin zymography was performed on samples from the
ischemic GC muscle to evaluate the level of MMP-9 three days
after ligation of the femoral artery. Eight mice (Wt, n¼ 4;
RNF213 -/-, n¼ 4) were euthanized three days after ligation of
the femoral artery and both GC muscles were rapidly
removed. The extraction of matrix metalloproteinases and
gelatin zymography were performed using the same procedures as described above. The relative intensity of an individual sample was normalized by the value obtained in a
control sample. The non-ischemic limb was adopted as the
control.

5.13.

Statistical analysis

All values were given as the mean7SD. Signiﬁcance was
assessed with a repeated measures two-way ANOVA and
subsequent Bonferroni post hoc test for the blood ﬂow
analysis. A repeated measures two-way ANOVA and subsequent Mann-Whitney post hoc test were used to analyze

brain research 1594 (2015) 310–320

ambulatory impairments. The Student’s t-test was used to
analyze the infarct volume, brain water content, immunohistochemistry of CD31, and gelatin zymography. Values of
po0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. Graph Pad Prism 5.03
(Graph Pad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used for all
statistical analysis.
