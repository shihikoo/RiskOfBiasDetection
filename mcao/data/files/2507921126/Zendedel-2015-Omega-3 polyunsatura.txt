Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA n3) provide neuroprotection due to their anti-inﬂammatory and
anti-apoptotic properties as well as their regulatory function on growth factors and neuronal plasticity. These
qualities enable PUFA n3 to ameliorate stroke outcome and limit neuronal damage. Young adult male rats received transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). PUFA n3 were intravenously administered into the
jugular vein immediately after stroke and 12 h later. We analyzed stroke volume and behavioral performance
as well as the regulation of functionally-relevant genes in the penumbra. The extent of ischemic damage was reduced and behavioral performance improved subject to applied PUFA n3. Expression of Tau and growthassociated protein-43 genes were likewise restored. Ischemia-induced increase of cytokine mRNA levels was
abated by PUFA n3. Using an in vitro approach, we demonstrate that cultured astroglial and microglia directly
respond to PUFA n3 administration by preventing ischemia-induced increase of cyclooxygenase 2, hypoxiainducible factor 1alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and interleukin 1beta. Cultured cortical neurons also
appeared as direct targets, since PUFA n3 shifted the Bcl-2-like protein 4 (Bax)/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl 2) ratio
towards an anti-apoptotic constellation. Thus, PUFA n3 reveal a high neuroprotective and anti-inﬂammatory
potential in an acute ischemic stroke model by targeting astroglial and microglial function as well as improving
neuronal survival strategies. Our ﬁndings signify the potential clinical feasibility of PUFA n3 therapeutic treatment in stroke and other acute neurological diseases.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the result of a permanent or transient focal occlusion of
major brain arteries or their branches and represents a main cause of
death and disability in the industrialized civilization. Brain damage
and neuronal cell death following acute ischemia result from a series
of complex pathophysiological processes that evolves in time and
space beginning a few minutes after stroke onset and lasting for hours
and days including secondary damage due to edema spreading even if
reperfusion has already been revived. Cell dysfunction and tissue
destruction are accompanied by local blood–brain barrier (BBB)
breakdown followed by the invasion of peripheral immune cells,
i.e. T-lymphocytes, macrophages and polymorph nuclear granulocytes.
Beforehand, a massive early disturbance of ion homeostasis, calcium
dysregulation, excitotoxicity, mitochondrial impairment together with
reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation can be observed (Iadecola

and Anrather, 2011; Dirnagl, 2012). The described pathomechanisms
coincide with the activation, attraction and proliferation of astroglial
and microglial cells. Astrogliosis and microgliosis are prevailing incidents in the penumbra during the initial stage of ischemia. Both glial
cell types control and tune early and late neuroinﬂammatory responses
resulting from oxygen and nutrient deprivation soon after the beginning of the ischemic phase (Dang et al., 2011). Although microglia is believed to play the most prominent role in the shaping of inﬂammatory
responses after stroke, latterly astrocytes in the center of ischemic tissue disintegration are considered to actively sense hypoxia and trigger
a battery of anti-inﬂammatory reactions (Ronaldson and Davis, 2012;
Habib and Beyer, 2014; Habib et al., 2014). Importantly, both types
of glial cells, the adjacent extracellular matrix, the endothelium
and neurons form a “neurovascular unit” that represents a dynamic
entity which shapes neuroinﬂammation in the setting of stroke
(Dirnagl, 2012).
Recent studies have shown that omega-3 essential polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFA n3) and in particular docosahexaenoic acid (DHA,
22:6, n-3) and to a lesser extent eicosapentanaenoic acid (EPA,
20:5, n-3) exert profound anti-inﬂammatory effects on the brain and

protect brain tissue in experimental models of acute stroke in neonatal
and adult animals and neuroinﬂammatory challenges besides being
beneﬁcial for brain development and cognitive function (Bazan, 2007;
Belayev et al., 2009; Hoffman et al., 2009; Cole et al., 2010; Orr et al.,
2013). Following short-term transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO), rodents with DHA substitution and higher brain DHA levels
revealed reduced infarct areas and cellular inﬂammatory responses as
well as attenuated leukocyte inﬁltration and concomitantly fewer
microglial cells (Belayev et al., 2009; Lalancette-Hebert et al., 2011;
Orr et al., 2013). Several hours after stroke, the resident microglial
cells become activated, accumulate in the vicinity of the lesion site
and in the penumbra region and start proliferating (Kriz and
Lalancette-Hebert, 2009; Dang et al., 2011; Lalancette-Hebert et al.,
2011). This deﬁnes the post-ischemic treatment window with DHA as
3–5 h. There is also good evidence that consumption of ﬁsh and ﬁsh
products (ﬁsh oil contains large amounts of DHA) is positively associated with a reduced risk of ischemic events in the CNS and cardiovascular
disease (Pascoe et al., 2014). There are several proposed cellular
mechanisms which could explain the safeguarding role of PUFA n3
under neuropathological conditions in the brain (Orr et al., 2013).
DHA affects growth factor regulation which may be responsible for increased neurite growth and synapse formation (Kim et al., 2011).
Coevally, DHA is anti-inﬂammatory in non-neuronal and neural tissues
targeting for instance cyclooxygenases (COX) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) as well as leukocyte inﬁltration and nuclear factor
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation
(Marcheselli et al., 2003; Orr et al., 2013). Such effects occur brainintrinsically but it has also been shown that DHA dampens systemic
inﬂammatory responses (Sijben and Calder, 2007).
In the present study, we aimed at demonstrating the neuroprotective potency of PUFA n3 in an experimental stroke rat model (transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion, tMCAO), its efﬁcacy in restoring motoric and sensory behavioral defects as well as morphological injury,
and analyzing its inﬂuence on the expression of stroke-associated inﬂammatory gene markers. By adopting an in vitro hypoxia approach,
we intended to curtail cell type-speciﬁc effects which might explain
neuroprotective mechanisms at the subcellular level.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Animals
In vivo experiments were performed with 12 week old male Wistar
rats (300–350 g, Charles-River, Germany) which were maintained in a
pathogen-free and climate-controlled environment with access to
water and food ad libitum and handled according to the rules of “Care
of Animal Subjects” (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). The animals
underwent routine cage maintenance once a week and microbiological
monitoring.

were ﬁxed after adequate signal intensity (100 perfusion units)
was detected. After adjusting the rat in a supine position and
following a small midline neck skin incision, the external jugular
vein was exposed and catheterized for subsequent blood
sampling/administration of 500 μL of the respective emulsion or
placebo solution. The catheter was passed subcutaneously and exteriorized through a small incision at the neck of the animal and
afﬁxed to a plastic pedestal (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) mounted
inside a harness system.
Subsequently, the common carotid arteries (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and the external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed, and the vagal nerve carefully preserved. Then, the ECA was
transiently clipped and the CCA was ligated at a proximal site. Directly before insertion of the catheter into the ICA, baseline values
of CBF given as BPU were measured. A commercial silicon coated
monoﬁlament (Doccol Corporation, USA) was subsequently introduced from the lumen of the distal CCA at the bifurcation until an
immediate drop in CBF baseline occurred. After 1 h of transient occlusion, CBF was restored (reperfusion phase) by removing the
monoﬁlament. The sham-operated animals underwent the same
anesthesia and surgical procedures with the exception of MCA
occlusion.
2.3. PUFA n3 substitution
Rats subjected to tMCAO were randomly assigned to receive 500 μL
of PUFA n3, Lipofundin MCT (Lipo MCT) or NaCl (duration of each application 3 min). Lipo MCT served as placebo control, since this emulsion
contains a comparable amount of triglycerides compared to PUFA n3
without substituted omega 3 fatty acids. All oil/NaCl emulsions were
intravenously applied in the deeply anesthetized animals through a
permanent ipsi-lateral jugular vein catheter immediately after 1 h occlusion and 12 h later. To avoid coagulation of the catheter tip within
the jugular vein, the tube was ﬂooded with highly diluted heparin
(1:1000 in physiological NaCl). Blood sampling was always performed
immediately before the application of oil emulsions and before sacriﬁcing the animals. The extracted volume for blood analysis (fatty acids)
was replaced by the same volume of physiological NaCl at body temperature immediately after blood sampling. All used solutions were
warmed up to body temperature (38 °C) before application. All emulsions were 20% oil-in-water emulsions. The emulsions therefore contain
200 g glycerides (oil) per L.
The following oil emulsions were used [conc. per L]:

2.2. Surgery and tMCAO
Artery occlusion was induced by unilateral intraluminal occlusion of
the middle cerebral artery for 1 h as previously described (Dang et al.,
2011; Ulbrich et al., 2012). Rats were anesthetized by inhalation of 5%
isoﬂurane (Abbott, Ludwigshafen, Germany) for 2 min and maintained
at 1.5–2% using a face mask. Rectal temperature was maintained at
37.0 ± 0.5 °C during surgery with a temperature-controlled heating
pad (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Regional cerebral blood
ﬂow (CBF) was measured using Laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry (Moor
Instruments VMS-LDF2, Axminster, UK) on the ipsi- and contralateral
side before, during, and after transient occlusion. The animals that
did not show a CBF reduction of at least 50% of baseline levels or died directly after ischemia induction were excluded from further processing.
For placing the laser probes, parietal bones were thinned 5.5 mm lateral
and 1 mm posterior to the Bregma, and the Laser Doppler ﬂow probes

LCT, long chain triglycerides; MCT, medium chain triglycerides,
eicosapentanaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
By applying two times 500 μL per rat (300 g) post-stroke, each animal
received a dosage of approx. 140 mg/day/kg (DHA) and 220 mg/day/kg
(EPA).
2.4. Analysis of fatty acids in blood plasma
Blood samples (500 μL) were taken initially after 24 h from the
tMCAO-, PUFA n3- and Lipo MCT-substituted groups before the animals
were sacriﬁced through the permanent jugular vein catheter which was
ﬂushed before with a small volume (100 μL) physiological NaCl. Fatty
acid analysis was commercially performed by Lipidomix GmbH (Berlin,
Germany, www.lipidomix.de). The analysis of all fatty acids in the

202

plasma fraction was achieved by HPLC and mass spectrometry (MS). To
obtain the plasma fraction, blood samples were kept for 30 min at room
temperature (RT) and then centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm. The
upper phase corresponds to the plasma, and the solid phase mainly to
erythrocytes. Both fractions were immediately frozen at −80 °C.
For measurements, methanol (500 μL) was added to serum samples
(30 mg). Afterwards, the solution was treated with 300 μL 10 M NaOH
for alkaline hydrolysis at 80 °C for 1 h and cooled down to RT for
10 min subsequently. The following neutralization was achieved by
adding 300 μL 58% acetic acid. The sample solution was diluted with
methanol (50 μL homogenate:450 μL methanol) and prepared for measurement by adding 10 μL internal-standard-solution (ISTD) (50 μg/mL
C15:0; 50 μg/mL C21:0, 1 μg/mL C22:6-d5, 1 μg/mL C20:5-d5, 5 μg/mL
C20:4-d8, 5 μg/mL C18:2-d4).
The fatty acid proﬁle was determined with LC–MS/MS analysis using
Agilent 6460 Triplequad mass spectrometer with Jetstream ion source
operating in negative mode (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA)
coupled with Agilent 1200 HPLC (degasser, binary pump, well plate
sampler, thermostated column compartment). As stationary phase
Phenomenex Kinetex Column (150 mm × 2m, 2.6 μm; Phenomenex,
Aschaffenburg, Germany) was used. The chromatography was performed with acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% formic acid (B) as mobile phase
under gradient conditions. It started at 30% B and decreased to 2%
within 10 min. The ﬂow rate was 0.4 mL/min during the 16.5 min run
time. The injection volume was 5 μL. The drying gas was adjusted
at 210 °C/7 L/min, nebulizer at 45 psi, sheath gas at 350 °C/11 L/min.
The capillary voltage was optimized at 4000 V (negative) and the
nozzle voltage at 1500 V (negative). The sample concentrations were
determined using linear calibration curves based on the relative peak
area dependent on the target-compound/ISTD-concentration ratios. A
complete list of measured target-compounds, the corresponding conditions for SIM and the calibration range are shown in Table 1.
2.5. Neurobehavioral tests
Neurobehavioral tests were performed 24 h after tMCAO as
described (Dang et al., 2011; Ulbrich et al., 2012). In brief, six selective
behavioral tests for motor and sensory dysfunction were carried

out (spontaneous activity, forepaw, stretching, climbing, stick body
perception, walking, vibrissae testing) giving a total of 18 points to be
reached per individual. Typically, control and sham animals always
scored 18 points. Tests were performed in a blinded way.
2.6. Tissue staining and calculation of infarct volume
At 24 h after tMCAO and after collecting the blood samples, the
animals were deeply anesthetized again (5% isoﬂurane) and received
an intra-peritoneal injection of an overdose of pentobarbital (328
mg/kg). Afterwards, the animals were transcardially perfused with
physiological NaCl. The brain was rapidly removed, placed in an icechilled rat brain matrix (Alto Brain Matrix stainless steel 1 mm rat coronal 300–600 g; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) for 1 min.
Then, brains were cut into six consecutive coronal sections with 2 mm
thickness. Sections were rapidly placed in a 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC, Fluka, Germany) solution for 15 min at 37 °C. Coronal slices
were arranged in a frontal to occipital order and photographed using a
digital camera (Canon Ixus 220HS). The unstained areas were deﬁned
as infarct area and further evaluated in a blinded manner using the
open access morphometric software ImageJ 1.41 (NIH, Bethesda, MD,
USA). Infarct volumes of the cerebral cortex were calculated for all used
TTC-stained slices by adding the mean-area of each section and multiplied
by 2 mm and section number.
2.7. Primary astroglia cultures
Culturing procedures were already described in detail (Habib et al.,
2014). BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River (Germany). All
procedures were performed in strict accordance with the published welfare rules for the care and use of laboratory animals at the University Hospital Aachen and the government of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia,
Germany. Cerebral cortices were prepared from neonatal 1–2 day old
mouse pups, minced, and dispersed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% (v/v) trypsin and 0.02% (v/v) EDTA. For further
mechanical disruption, tissue was ﬁltered through a 50 μm nylon mesh
in DMEM. Dissociated cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1.400 rpm
for 5 min, re-suspended in 10% FBS-DMEM supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, PAA, Austria) and penicillin/
streptomycin (0.05%, Invitrogen, Germany).
Cells were grown in 75 cm3 cell culture ﬂasks coated with poly-Lornithine (PLO, Sigma, Germany) to conﬂuence at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. Cultures were trypsinized with 2.5% (v/v)
trypsin diluted in PBS/EDTA buffer and split 1:3 into new 75 cm3 cell culture ﬂasks. The medium was changed every second day. After reaching
conﬂuence of 80–90%, cells were placed on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm
for 2 h to detach microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells.
Afterwards, astrocytes were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of
0.8–1.3 × 105 cells/cm2 until cells reached conﬂuence. 24 h before
starting hypoxia, the culture medium was changed to the treatment medium Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI, glutathione 0.001 mg/mL,
L-glutamine 0.3 mg/mL, sodium bicarbonate 2.0 mg/mL, vitamins, amino
acids, HEPES) 1640 without phenol red (Invitrogen, Germany) adjusted
to 2 mg/mL glucose and supplemented with 5% (v/v) PS. RPMI medium
were used without phenol-red and FBS were exchanged in steroid
hormone-free Charcoal-Stripped fetal bovine serum (CSFBS) during
pre-treatment. The purity of astrocytic cultures (N95% pure) was periodically veriﬁed using staining with an antibody for the astrocytic marker
glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP, Dako, Denmark) (Pawlak et al.,
2005).
2.8. BV-2 cells
The BV-2 cell line, originally generated by Blasi and colleagues (Blasi
et al., 1990) by retroviral raf/myc-immortalization of neonatal murine
microglia cells, was purchased from Banca biologica e cell factory

A. Zendedel et al. / Journal of Neuroimmunology 278 (2015) 200–211

(Centro di Risorse Biologiche, IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria,
Genova, Italy). Cells were maintained in a humidiﬁed atmosphere at
37 °C and 95% air/5% CO2. Culture medium consisted of 4.5 mg/L high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) steroid-free heat-inactivated
FBS and 0.5% (v/v) PS. The medium was changed twice a week until
cells reached a conﬂuence of approx. 80%. Cells were dissociated using
2.5% (v/v) trypsin-EDTA and centrifuged at 300 ×g. Cell pellets were resuspended in culture medium and seeded at a density of 105 cells/cm2
in 12-well plates. For seeding, RPMI medium 1640 without phenol red adjusted to 2 mg/mL glucose and supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) PS was
used. FBS concentrations were minimized to 1% (v/v). To obtain steroidfree serum, FBS was subjected to charcoal-stripping before use.
2.9. Neuronal cell cultures
Cultures were prepared from the cerebral hemispheres of BALB/c
mouse brains at gestation day 16 and cultured as described previously
with slight modiﬁcations (Misiak et al., 2010). Mouse embryos were
taken from pregnant mice after cervical dislocation. Embryonic mouse
brains (embryonic day 18–19) were excised aseptically from the skull.
The cerebral cortices were dissected from the meninges, hippocampi,
and basal ganglia under sterile conditions, minced, and incubated in
0.1% (v/v) trypsin at 37 °C for 15 min. The suspension was supplemented with 20% (v/v) heat inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS; PAA, Coelbe,
Germany) and DNase I (170 units/mL; Sigma, Germany), triturated,
and centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min. The cells were re-suspended in
neurobasal medium (NBM) supplemented with 0.4% (v/v) B-27 supplement, 2 mM L-glutamine (Glutamax1) and 10% (v/v) FCS and plated
onto PLO-coated culture dishes at a density of 1.5–2.0 × 105 cells/cm2.
Neuronal cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere
of 95% air/5% CO2. After 24 h, the cell medium was deprived of FCS. This
procedure typically yields N 90% neurons.
2.10. Hypoxia in vitro and PUFA n3 treatment
As previously described (Habib et al., 2013; Habib and Beyer, 2014;
Habib et al., 2014), a cube-shaped hypoxia chamber was ﬂooded with
inert nitrogen gas to replace oxygen 30 min prior to experimentation.
Oxygen levels were continuously monitored using an oxygen detector
(Gox 100T, Greisinger Electronic GmbH, Germany). Temperature was
maintained at 37 °C. Prior to hypoxia, the culture medium was switched
to RPMI medium (RPMI 1640, 1% (v/v) CSFBS, 0.1% (v/v) PS). Cells were
exposed to hypoxia for 1 h (neuronal cells) or 3 h (astroglia, BV-2 cells)
with or without emulsion supplementation (see also treatment protocols summarized in Fig. 7). PUFA n3 and Lipo MCT were diluted
1:1000 in the same culture medium resulting in a treatment dosage of
43 mg/mL (DHA) and 65 mg/mL (EPA).
2.11. Cell viability assay
After hypoxia, cell viability was determined by the release of lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH, CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay,
Promega, Germany) into the cell supernatant measured at 490–520 nm.
Absorption was measured using a microplate reader (Tecan GmbH,
Switzerland). Positive controls were prepared by using the in the kit
enclosed lysis buffer yielding a maximum of cell break-up. Cells without
treatment but a medium change served as negative controls. For further
details see refs. (Habib et al., 2013, 2014).
2.12. RNA extraction and reverse transcription
After TTC staining in vivo, cortical ipsilateral penumbra and contralateral cortical samples were transferred into homogenization tubes containing 1.4 mm beats and peqGold RNA TriFast (PeqLap, Germany).
Samples were homogenized at 5000 ×g for 15 s. RNA was isolated by
phenol-chloroform extraction using peqGold RNA TriFast. Similarly,

203

cultured cells were scratched-off and processed as above. Total RNA
amount and purity was determined using 260/280 ratios of optical density from each sample (Nanodrop 1000, PeqLap, Germany). Samples
were approved pure if the 260/280 ratio was around 2.0 ± 0.1. Reverse
transcription from mRNA to complementary DNA was conducted using
the M-MLV reverse transcription (RT)-kit and random hexanucleotide
primers (Invitrogen, Germany) using 1 μg/mL of mRNA. The same procedure was applied to harvested cultured cells.
2.13. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Measurement of expression levels of target genes was performed
with a mixture consisting of 2 μL reversed-transcribed cDNA, 2 μL
RNAse-free water (Invitrogen, Germany), 5 μL 2× SensiMix SYBR &
Fluorescein (Bioline, Germany), and 0.5 μL primers (10 pmol/μL).
Quantitative PCR analysis was performed using the MyIQ RT-qrtPCR detection system (Biorad, Germany) in special 96-well plates (BIOplastics,
Netherlands) under following conﬁgurations: 10 min enzyme activation at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 30 s at primer-speciﬁc annealing temperatures, 30 s ampliﬁcation at 72 °C, and 5 s ﬂuorescence measurement at
72 °C. To calculate expression levels of target genes, an external standard was generated by 7-times repeated 2-fold dilutions of total sample
pooling. Note that each sample was coevally diluted 10-fold to adjust
concentration within the range of the external standard. The target
and housekeeping gene cyclophilin (CYCA) for in vivo rat samples or
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) for in vitro
samples were measured at cycle threshold (Ct-values) by the RTqrtPCR. Relative quantiﬁcation was calculated by the ΔCt-method. In
each run, external standard curves were generated by several-fold
dilutions of target genes as mentioned above. Data were expressed
as relative amount of the target to the amount of CycloA or HPRT,
respectively. Up- and down-regulation of genes of interest after
tMCAO were graphically illustrated by fold-change subjected to ipsilateral site of the respective sham group. In vitro regulation after hypoxia
was graphically illustrated by fold-change subjected to normoxia.
Note that sham and normoxia values were always set up to 100%.
Software-supported evaluation of melting curve (iQ5 System Software,
Biorad, Germany) and electrophoretic analysis were routinely performed to qualify the speciﬁcity of the RT-qrtPCR products. Annealing

3. Results
Coronal sections of the rat brains were stained with TTC to quantify
the extent of hypoxia-induced injury and the inﬂuence of PUFA n3
application on stroke parameters. Representative images of these

experiments are shown in Fig. 1A–C. After tMCAO, tissue damage was
always observed on the ipsi-lateral hemisphere as illustrated by the
white area with an accurate delineation of the penumbra (Fig. 1A).
Brains of tMCAO animals typically exhibited consistent necrotic lesions
conforming to cortical and subcortical regions. The calculated total Cx
infarct volume per animal was approx. 180 mm3 (set to 100% in
diagrams). Fig. 1B shows the location of the ipsi- and contra-lateral
micro-dissected areas used for molecular analysis of gene expression.
The PUFA n3 group showed a substantially reduced infarct area and volume compared to the tMCAO group (Figs. 1C and 2). In the majority of
rats, neuroprotection was restricted to the cortical but not subcortical
brain regions. No signiﬁcant beneﬁt concerning the infarct area was detected in the Lipo MCT group. Consistently, we found improved behavioral scoring in the PUFA n3 but not in the Lipo MCT group compared to
the tMCAO animals (Fig. 2B). Sham animals always achieved full scores
(18 points in 6 tests), whereas tMCAO rats normally reached approx.
30% of the possible scores.
In order to determine the systemic levels of DHA, EPA, and ALA, we
examined blood plasma in 24 h post-ischemic animals which received
two injections of PUFA n3 or Lipo MCT emulsions after 1 h and 12 h
and compared them to basal levels obtained from sham animals. Fig. 3
summarizes these data and shows that ALA but not DHA and EPA
were decreased after tMCAO and that EPA and DHA were increased
after PUFA n3 application by N 100%. Due to the limited number of
analytic probes, no secure quantitative statistical analysis could be
performed rather than qualitative changes are presented.
In the next step, we determined the expression levels of a number of
marker genes which provide information related to the mechanistic action of PUFA n3 in micro-dissected tissue probes of the penumbra from
the ipsi-lateral hemisphere and the corresponding area from the contralateral site. First, GAP-43 and Tau as indices for dendritic- and axonal
preservation, respectively, were quantiﬁed (Fig. 4). Both markers were

far, no adequate data of ischemia-induced expression levels and regulation of this gene within the penumbra were available. As shown in Fig. 5,
NLRP3 is almost absent in sham animals and the contra-lateral hemisphere of tMCAO rats. In contrast, we observed a signiﬁcant ipsi-lateral
rise of this gene product and also found that PUFA n3 partially prevented
this activation. Third, we have quantiﬁed two marker genes corresponding to the mainly inﬂammatory M1 (arginase 1, Arg1) and protective M2
(triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2, Trem2) phenotype of
microglia (Taylor and Sansing, 2013; Habib and Beyer, 2014). The proinﬂammatory Arg1 is strongly induced in the ipsi-lateral penumbra
after tMCAO, whereas PUFA n3 in part inhibited this increment
(Fig. 6). On the other hand, we detected a duplication of Trem2 after
PUFA n3 administration in the ipsi-lateral hemisphere after tMCAO
(although not reaching a signiﬁcance level). By forming the ratio of
both markers, we assume that PUFA n3 shifts the phenotype towards a
more protective form of microglia (ipsi-lateral tMCAO:Arg1/Trem2

downregulated in the ipsi-lateral but not contra-lateral cortex of tMCAO
rats. PUFA n3 signiﬁcantly increased and even doubled GAP-43 mRNA
levels compared to sham and tMCAO contra-lateral probes. Tau mRNA
levels were restored to control (sham) levels in the PUFA n3 group.
The application of Lipo MCT did not modify ipsi-lateral tMCAO values
(data not shown). Second, we have measured a batch of inﬂammatory
genes known to be involved in ischemic pathophysiology in the brain.
As expected, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1a), interleukin 1ß
(IL1ß) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) were massively upregulated in the ipsi- but not contra-lateral cerebral cortex of tMCAO animals
(Fig. 5A-C). In all three cases, PUFA n3 signiﬁcantly abated this increase
resulting in moderately elevated levels of inﬂammatory gene mRNAs. In
addition, we have analyzed the expression levels of the inﬂammasome
termed nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing
protein 3 (NLRP3) which is involved in the process of inﬂammation
and IL1ß and IL18 processing in the penumbra (Walsh et al., 2014). So

the water channel protein aquaporin 4 (AQP4) remained unchanged
(Fig. 9C). Again, PUFA n3 but not Lipo MCT abolished the increase of
COX2 and HIF1a.
Finally, we have evaluated the inﬂuence of hypoxia on and the regulation by oil emulsions of Bcl-2-like protein 4 (Bax) which represents
an apoptosis regulator and antagonist of the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) in primary neuronal cultures from the cerebral cortex
(Fig. 10). Bax expression levels signiﬁcantly increased after hypoxia.
Bcl-2 expression levels remained unaffected. PUFA n3 was able to
keep Bax levels at basal values and did not modify Bcl-2 expression.
By expressing data as the ratio of Bax vs. Bcl-2 which serves as an
index for susceptibility for cell death (N1) and for cell protection (b1)
(25), our data show a ratio of approx. 0.7 after PUFA n3 supplementation (Fig. 10C). This supports the view that PUFA n3 reduces the vulnerability of neurons to hypoxic stress.

not modify expression levels of all genes compared to the tMCAO
group (data not shown).
To determine whether an in vitro approach using a hypoxia chamber
allows pinpointing cell-speciﬁc effects of PUFA n3 on hypoxia-regulated
genes, we established primary cell cultures (astroglia and neurons) and a
murine microglia-like cell line (BV-2). As presented in Fig. 7, we have at
ﬁrst tested how hypoxia affects LDH release as a viability marker and
whether PUFA n3 and Lipo MCT affects LDH release (Fig. 7). None of
the treatments altered hypoxia-related changes in LDH release. Generally, primary cells appeared to be more vulnerable to hypoxia than BV-2
cells, thereby corresponding to our previous data (Habib et al., 2013,
2014). In BV-2 cultures, hypoxia signiﬁcantly induced the expression of
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), TNFa and the chemokine (C-C
motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) compared to cells kept under normoxia (Fig. 8).
Only PUFA n3 was able to suppress the induction of all three genes,
thereby preserving basal expression levels. Lipo MCT revealed mild compensatory effects by slightly but not signiﬁcantly reducing TNFa and
CCL5 levels (Fig. 8B and C). Cortical astroglial cells responded to hypoxia
by increasing COX2 and HIF1a expression (Fig. 9A and B), whereas

Lalancette-Hebert et al., 2011; Orr et al., 2013). Using a transient ischemic rat model, we describe that both the cortical infarct volume and behavioral deﬁcits are signiﬁcantly reduced and ameliorated, respectively,
under PUFA n3 treatment. The mitigation of cell damage appears to be
the result of PUFA n3-mediated attenuation of neuroinﬂammation in
the penumbra which involves the dampening of the expression of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and the prevention of activation of local
microglia from a resting into a pro-apoptotic phenotype. The in vitro
study implies that astrocytes and microglia are direct targets for PUFA
n3 by abolishing their cell type-related inﬂammatory responses. We
would point out that also cortical neurons immediately respond to
PUFA n3 exposure by regulating apoptosis-related Bax levels. A clear
shift from a pro- towards an anti-apoptotic neuronal phenotype was

observed. Thus, PUFA n3 represent a multifarious effector in the
brain regulating different set screws which in their entirety provide a
neuroprotective environment for neurons under pathophysiological
conditions.
The efﬁcacy of PUFA n3 to mediate tissue protection has been described in a wide spectrum of brain disease models. Outside the brain,
PUFA n3 mediate cardiovascular protection (Richard et al., 2014),
prevent bone loss in osteoporosis (Casado-Diaz et al., 2013), improve
health outcome in rheumatoid arthritis (Calder and Yaqoob, 2009),
and, in general terms, are positive effectors in different kinds of inﬂammatory processes (Bannenberg, 2009). In the brain under neuropathological conditions, PUFA n3 suppress neuroinﬂammatory challenges
such as inﬂammation initiated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (Orr et al.,

and symptomatology of such psychiatric disorders and ascribe to them a
positive therapeutic gain possibly through psychoneuroimmunological
mechanisms (Sublette et al., 2011; Bellino et al., 2014). In experimental
ischemic stroke, PUFA n3 preserve damaged neuronal tissue and ameliorate functional outcome (Belayev et al., 2009; Lalancette-Hebert
et al., 2011; Eady et al., 2012) and in agreement, pre-stroke dietary supplementation with these ﬁsh oil compounds positively affects severity
of ischemia in humans (Mishina et al., 2013) and neuronal loss of tissue
and function in ischemic animal models (Choi-Kwon et al., 2004; Bas
et al., 2007).
It is important for the mechanistic understanding of PUFA n3mediated neuroprotection ﬁrst, to detail direct effects within the impaired brain area and correlate such effects with the functional outcome
and second, to depict cellular targets and cell type-speciﬁc responses.
Administration (i.v.) of PUFA n3 doubled systemic DHA and EPA plasma
levels. The chosen in vivo dosage of PUFA n3 with approx. 150 mg/d/kg
DHA and 220 mg/d/kg EPA resemble very well the magnitudes of dosing
reported in other studies (Bas et al., 2007; Mills et al., 2011; Eady et al.,
2012; Orr et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014; Paterniti et al., 2014). Plasma analysis revealed that the chosen application form and doses raised the respective plasma levels of DHA and EPA by N 100% at the end of the 24
h post-ischemic period. Most likely, plasma values are even higher immediately after application and during the following hours. A veriﬁcation of this assumption however could not be undertaken due to the
fact that repeated blood withdrawals in this critical time after ischemia
could negatively inﬂuence the study outcome. It needs to be mentioned
at this point that long-term substitution with PUFA n3 affects the phospholipid composition of the plasma membrane. This effect seems to be
dose-dependent and follows a time-course of days to a few weeks
(reviewed by Calder (2013)). The incorporation of these PUFA n3 is
mainly at the expense of n6 fatty acids, i.e. arachidonic acid (Miles
et al., 2004). The prompt and short application duration of PUFA n3 in
our setting and the typical time frame for neuroprotection in ischemia
of less than 12 h bypass the problem of extensive changes in the lipid
composition of membranes and rather favor the idea that distinct

PUFA n3-related cell signaling (see below) is responsible for neuroprotective effects.
The transport of DHA across the BBB appears to be mediated by an
orphan receptor, major facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2a (Mfsd2a) (Nguyen et al., 2014). At the cellular level, ﬁsh oils
modulate toll-like receptor (TLR4) signaling and nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain protein (NOD) signaling (Liu et al., 2013),
inhibit c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JUN) (Ma et al., 2009), and reduce or
block NF-κB signaling (Orr et al., 2013). This includes direct interactions
with the cell membrane located G-protein coupled receptor 120
(GPR120) and/or the phospholipid raft assembly of EPA and DHA in
the plasma membrane and the resulting regulation of the peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor (PPARγ) (reviewed by Calder (2013)).
In addition, PUFA n3 interfere with the phosphorylation of the serine–
threonine protein kinase Akt1 and Forkhead box O (FOXO) as demonstrated in muscle (Liu et al., 2013). Together, this highlights the
multiplicity of cellular PUFA n3 signaling.
Two marker genes for axonal integrity and dendritic plasticity, Tau
and GAP-43, which are both down-regulated after tMCAO, are restored
or even up-regulated over control levels after PUFA n3 treatment. Such
PUFA n3 effects were not seen in neuronal cultures. Therefore, we assume that these in vivo effects are indirectly transmitted through
balancing neuroinﬂammatory responses and glial activation rather
than the consequence of direct neuronal stimulation. However, the
applied highly pure culture model of cortical neurons allows speculating
that neurons directly proﬁt from high PUFA n3 levels. We found that
PUFA n3 shifted the balance of Bax and Bcl-2 from 1.5 under ischemic
conditions to 0.7 after treatment which represents a protective physiological – rather than apoptotic – situation (Li et al., 2013). In the
developing and adult CNS, PUFA n3 have also been attributed a direct
anti-apoptotic function under stress conditions (Liu et al., 2014;
Paterniti et al., 2014), and in support of this, protect neural progenitor
cells against oxidative injury (Sinha et al., 2009). These ﬁndings illustrate the importance of PUFA n3 which are essential components of
the cell membranes for neuronal development and function.

Nevertheless, we hypothesize that the anti-inﬂammatory potential
of PUFA n3 described below is mainly responsible for neuroprotection
in ischemia. This is demonstrated by a highly signiﬁcant reduction of
the expression of pro-inﬂammatory markers such TNFa, IL1ß, and
COX2 in vitro and in vivo. Data with respect to Tau and GAP-43 gene
regulation are sparse or inconsistent. While PUFA n3 downregulated
GAP-43 and TNFa in piglets after LPS exposure (Liu et al., 2013), reduced
GAP-43 labeling in a SCI model, different interleukins and TNFa in LPSstimulated macrophages (Figueroa et al., 2013; Solanki et al., 2013),
and inhibited ischemia-mediated leukocyte inﬁltration and proinﬂammatory gene expression (Marcheselli et al., 2003), Tau levels appeared to be only lightly lowered in an Alzheimer disease animal model
(Phivilay et al., 2009) or decreased in cultured hippocampal neurons
(Ma et al., 2009). On the other hand, DHA promoted hippocampal
neurite sprouting and synaptogenesis which require GAP-43 and Tau
(Kim et al., 2011). Concerning microglial activation, it has been reported
in agreement with our observations (M1 to M2 phenotype shift of
microglia) that PUFA n3 attenuate microglial activation in early retinal
degeneration by converting activated microglia into a quiescent phenotype (Ebert et al., 2009). After ischemic stroke, microglia become activated and obtain an ameboid morphology which is associated with
the release of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines corresponding to the M1
phenotype (Kigerl et al., 2009; Taylor and Sansing, 2013). In contrast,
M2 microglia are able to limit inﬂammation and phagocytosis as well
as extracellular matrix remodeling as has been demonstrated for invaded macrophages in an injured spinal cord (Kigerl et al., 2009; Taylor and
Sansing, 2013). These dual and opposing roles of microglia (similar to
those of macrophages) suggest that stroke therapies should strive for
balancing the detrimental and beneﬁcial actions. This makes this
immune cell type the ideal candidate for pharmacological stroke
therapy (Dang et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2012; Habib et al., 2013;
Chen et al., 2014; Habib and Beyer, 2014). Furthermore, microglia
are the major source for expressing the multi-protein complexes
called inﬂammasomes which contribute to cell death in brain injury
(Rathinam et al., 2012; Walsh et al., 2014). This particularly applies to
the two inﬂammasomes NLRP1 and NLRP3 under glucose- and
oxygen-deprived conditions in vitro and after tMCAO challenge in
mice (Fann et al., 2013). Only limited information about PUFA n3 and
the regulation of inﬂammasomes is available (Teng et al., 2014). Here,
we present for the ﬁrst time evidence that PUFA n3 inhibit the expression of the inﬂammasome NLRP3 locally within the penumbra which
is consistent with the above mentioned mitigation of IL1ß upregulation
in the present and previous studies (Dang et al., 2011). Altogether, our
in vivo and in vitro ﬁndings suggest that locally activated microglia
within the penumbra are primary targets for PUFA n3 and that early
inﬂammatory processes soon after the beginning of ischemia are controlled by PUFA n3. Our in vitro approach using the BV2 cell line instead
of primary microglia to locate direct effects of PUFA n3 in microglia is
justiﬁed by the fact that this cell line shares many functional and phenotypic similarities to microglia (reviewed by Habib and Beyer, 2014). BV2
cells and microglia concordantly respond to hypoxia by activity shift
and expression of inﬂammatory markers.
Besides microglia, we also identiﬁed astroglia as primary targets for
PUFA n3 in vitro. Astrocytes, and in particular activated astrocytes observed under ischemic conditions, are also an integral part of the
brain-intrinsic immune response in general and under stroke-like conditions (Downes and Crack, 2010; Barreto et al., 2011; Habib et al.,
2014). For instance, astrocytes produce prostaglandins through COX2
and sense hypoxia by expression hypoxia-related genes such as HIF1a
(Habib et al., 2014). BBB breakdown is a critical regulator of brain homeostasis and a dysfunction resembles an important aspect of early
and late post-ischemic pathophysiological episodes. BBB contributes to
edema formation and swelling, and is therefore an interesting target
for pharmacotherapy of stroke (Ronaldson and Davis, 2012; Shah and
Abbruscato, 2014). Astroglial prostaglandins and HIF1a are involved in
de-stabilizing BBB integrity (Kaur et al., 2006; Lin, 2013). Our data

show that ischemia-induced expression of COX-2 and HIF1a are both
attenuated after PUFA n3 application. These data are in line with another
report which has presented information that DHA decreased BBB disruption and metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9) in TBI (Russell et al., 2014).
Mmp9 is associated with BBB disruption and subsequent T cell migration into the CNS. A further lead comes from an in vitro study which
has shown that PUFA n3 are able to decrease Mmp9 activity and T cell
migration (Shinto et al., 2011). Importantly, DHA de novo synthesis in
the human brain is low. Thus, DHA must be transported across the
BBB. Recently, a member of the major facilitator superfamily (Mfsd2a)
has been recognized as a transporter for DHA across the BBB (Nguyen
et al., 2014). Thus, DHA carriage into the CNS requires an intact BBB
and concurrently, DHA contributes to a stabilized BBB under pathological circumstances.
Using a transient focal ischemic animal model, we could demonstrate that PUFA n3 provides solid neuroprotection in the cerebral cortex which is paralleled by a reduction of behavioral deﬁcits. Two
important notes arise from the in vivo approach. First, local neuroinﬂammation within the cortical penumbra is slowed down and second,
the switch of local microglia in the penumbra from a devastating M1to a more protective M2 phenotype is promoted by PUFA n3. Finally,
in vitro data pinpoint microglia, astroglia and neurons comparably as direct targets for PUFA n3 with different cell type-speciﬁc physiological
responses, all relevant for neuron protection after an apoplexy. Clinical
trials have now to reappraise the hypothesis of neuroprotective PUFA
n3 in humans. Due to the shortage of adequate treatment protocols
and compounds for protecting human tissue damage after ischemic
stroke, PUFA n3 could be recommended based on cost-effectiveness,
safe application form, biological compatibility and low adverse effects.
