Telmisartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker with high lipid solubility, also called
metabo-sartan, not only reduces blood pressure (BP), but also ameliorates inflammation in the cerebral cortex and in adipose tissue. We examined the effects of telmisartan on inflammatory responses of monocyte chemotactic protein-1, tumor
necrosis factor-a, and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 in the brain of
spontaneously hypertensive rat stroke-resistant (SHR-SR) after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). At 12 weeks of age, SHR-SR received tMCAO for
90 minutes and were divided into 3 groups, that is, the vehicle group, a low-dose
telmisartan group (.3 mg/kg/day), and a high-dose telmisartan group (3 mg/kg/
day). Immunohistological analysis was performed when rats became 6, 12 and
18 months old. Monocyte chemotactic protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-a, and
ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 cells (/mm2) immunoreactivities
increased with age in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the vehicle group,
suggesting strong and persistent inflammatory changes in SHR-SR after tMCAO
up to 18 months of age. On the other hand, a low dose of telmisartan significantly
reduced such inflammatory changes without lowering BP, whereas a high dose of
telmisartan showed a few additional improvements, including the lowering of
BP throughout 6-18 months of age. The present study suggests that persistent
hypertension after tMCAO caused a long-lasting inflammatory response in the
SHR-SR brain, and that even a low dose of telmisartan reduced continuous inflammation without lowering BP via its pleiotropic effects in the SHR-SR brain. A
high dose of telmisartan had a few additional benefits, including lowering
BP. Key Words: Spontaneously hypertensive ratâ€”inflammatory responseâ€”
MCP-1â€”TNF-aâ€”Iba-1â€”telmisartan.

Spontaneously hypertensive rat stroke-prone (SHR-SP)
and stroke-resistant (SHR-SR) are genetic models that
develop persistent hypertension spontaneously. We previously reported that SHR-SP developed arteriosclerosis
of the common carotid artery by expressing inflammatory
cytokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and
macrophage infiltration.1 SHR-SP showed increased
MCP-1 expression and macrophage infiltration. We also
reported that statin reduced not only arterial lipid deposition but also inflammation,1 suggesting that inflammation is essential for the formation of arteriosclerosis.2

at an acute stage, as was previously shown by our group,
with strong expression of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)
and MCP-1 in the metabolic Zucker rat model following
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO).4
However, the long-term inflammatory response of the
brain has not been well studied after a short period of
cerebral ischemia.
Telmisartan is a highly lipid-soluble angiotensin type 1
receptor blocker, and is also called metabo-sartan.5,6
Telmisartan decreases not only blood pressure (BP) but
also ameliorates inflammation in the cerebral cortex and
adipose tissue with short treatment period.7,8 In this
study, we examined the long-term effects of telmisartan
on inflammation in the SHR-SR brain after tMCAO
because no such studies exist. To reveal a pleiotropic
effect without lowering BP and also a combined effect
with lowering BP, we examined 2 doses of telmisartan,
namely low (.3 mg/kg/day) and high (3 mg/kg/day).

Materials and Methods
Animals
Seven-week-old male SHR-SR were provided from the
Disease Model Cooperative Research Association (Kyoto,
Japan) and placed on a basal diet. Animals were maintained for at least 7 days before the experiment in a
temperature-regulated room (23-25 C) on a 12-hour
light/dark cycle. The rats were fasted but allowed free access to water overnight before surgery.

Ischemia/Reperfusion Model
Transient focal ischemia was induced in rats by right
middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO) at
12 weeks of age (body weight 260-280 g). Briefly, the
rats were anesthetized by inhalation of a 69%/30% (v/
v) mixture of nitrous oxide/oxygen with 1% halothane
using a face mask. A midline neck incision was made,
and the right common carotid artery was exposed. The
right MCA was occluded by inserting a silicone-coated
4-0 surgical nylon thread through the common carotid artery. Using this technique, the tip of the thread occludes
the origin of the right MCA. During these procedures,
body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe
and was maintained at 37 6 .3 C using a heating pad.
The surgical incision was then closed and the animals
were allowed to recover at room temperature. After 90 minutes of tMCAO, the suture was removed to restore blood
flow (reperfusion). Sham control animals were treated
with cervical surgery but without inserting the nylon
thread. The animals were kept at ambient temperature
until sampling, with free access to water and food.

Drug Preparation
On the day of tMCAO at 12 weeks, these SHR-SR rats
(n 5 51) were divided into the following 3 groups: the

SHR-SR vehicle group (SHR/Ve, n 5 19), the SHR-SR
low-dose telmisartan group in which BP did not fall
(SHR/low, n 5 16), and the SHR-SR high-dose telmisartan group in which BP fell significantly by 30 mmHg or
more (SHR/high, n 5 16), receiving daily oral doses of
.5% methylcellulose (MC, .1 mL) only (SHR-SR vehicle
group), .5% MC plus a low dose of telmisartan (.3 mg/
kg/day) or .5% MC plus a high dose of telmisartan
(3 mg/kg/day) for the subsequent 3, 9, and 15 months
until sacrifice by oral gavage, respectively. The dose of telmisartan was determined as previously described (Kumai
et al, 2008; Wienen and Schierok 2001). Telmisartan was
provided by Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim am Rhein,
Germany), and was given to the 2 rat groups as a suspension with 5% MC in .1 mL water every day.
At 6, 12, or 18 months of age, the rats were transcardially
perfused with 5 U/mL chilled heparinized saline followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.6)
under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital (20 mg/250 g
rat). After decapitation, their brains were removed. All
experimental procedures were approved by the Animal
Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine and
Dentistry, Okayama University. The present study focused
on the inflammatory response in a whole project of the
effect of telmisartan on SHR-SR after tMCAO.

Immunohistochemistry
After the brains were removal, they were immersed
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with .1 M PB (pH
7.6) for 8 hours, embedded in paraffin, and 5 mm-thick
sections were prepared for subsequent immunostaining.
For MCP-1, TNF-a, and ionized calcium-binding adapter
molecule 1 (Iba-1), the brain sections were pretreated by
heating them 3 times in a 500-W microwave for 5 minutes
in 10 mM (pH 6.0) citric acid buffer. These pretreated sections were then immersed in .5% periodic acid to block
intrinsic peroxidase and treated with 5% normal horse
serum in 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing .05% Tween 20 to block any nonspecific antibody
response, and were finally incubated overnight with each
primary antibody. The following primary antibodies were
used in this study: monoclonal anti-MCP-1 antibody
(1:100, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-TNF-a antibody
(1:500, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and anti-Iba-1
antibody (Iba-1, 1: 200, Abcam). A biotinylated antimouse antibody for MCP-1, TNF-a, and Iba-1 staining
was used as the secondary antibody, and specific labeling
was visualized by a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA). To guarantee the specific staining of primary antibodies, a set of brain sections was also stained
without primary antibodies.

Detection and Analyses
The previously mentioned stained sections were digitized with a digital microscope camera (Olympus BX-51;

on the right periischemic lesion (ipsilateral) side and on
the contralateral left side. Furthermore, MCP-1- and
TNF-a-positive neurons were quantified by counting
stained cells in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the bilateral
hippocampus and expressed as the percentage of MCP1- and TNF-a-positive neurons over the total number of
neurons in those regions. Iba-1-positive cells per each
1 mm2 of the bilateral hippocampus were also counted.
Data are expressed as the mean 6 standard deviation.
Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of
variance with repeated measures (multiple comparisons).
Planned comparisons were used for Tukey-Kramer posthoc analysis. P , .05 was considered significant. All
statistical analyses were performed with Statcel statistical
package (Statcel 2; OMS Inc., Tokorozawa, Japan).

Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the long-term
changes of inflammatory cytokine MCP-1, accumulation
of TNF-a in neurons, and Iba-1-positive microglial activation in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of SHR-SR
after tMCAO (Figs 1-6). The results demonstrate that
strong and persistent inflammatory changes were

observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of
hypertensive rats (SHR/Ve) after tMCAO up to
18 months of age that a low dose of telmisartan (SHR/
low) reduced such changes without lowering BP, and
that a high dose of telmisartan (SHR/high) further
improved such changes while lowering BP (SHR/high).
We previously showed that SHR-SP developed cervical
arteriosclerosis while expressing inflammatory cytokine
MCP-1 and macrophage infiltration.1 Cervical arteriosclerosis was improved with a lipophilic statin such as simvastatin and in statin-treated rats, arterial lipid deposition,
and inflammation were greatly reduced,1 suggesting
that inflammation is essential for the formation of arteriosclerosis.2 SHR also showed a higher level of MCP-1 protein,9 and MCP-1 and TNF-a gene expression in the brain
than Wistar rats.10 Such inflammatory cytokines stimulated microglia,11,12 and activated microglia themselves
also produced TNF.11 The present study demonstrated

the persistent accumulation of inflammatory cytokines
(MCP-1 and TNF-a) and activation of microglia in the
cerebral cortex and the hippocampus after tMCAO in
SHR-SR (Fig 1-6A, D and G).
Ischemic stroke begins with severe focal hypoperfusion, which leads to excitatory and oxidative stresses,
which in turn cause microvascular injury, bloodâ€“brain
barrier dysfunction, and initiate postischemic inflammation.3 We previously showed that tMCAO induced strong
inflammation with TNF-a and MCP-1 in the nerve cells of
the ischemic core and a penumbra in the metabolic
Zucker rat model.4 In addition to simple inflammatory
responses by hypertension, cerebral ischemia thus causes
further inflammatory changes in the brain with stronger
cytokine expression and microglial activation.13 MCP-1
and TNF-a were activated after a stroke in humans.14
MCP-1 and TNF-a were also elevated in the brains of
SHR after global cerebral ischemia15,16 and TNF-a

antibody promoted cell survival in the rat tMCAO
model.17 In the present study, high MCP-1 expression
lasted in the cerebrocortical neurons (Fig 1A, D and G),
and TNF-a expression in the neuron and microglial activation remained high up until 18 months (Figs 2, 3A, D
and G). In the hippocampus, which was primarily out
of the affected MCA territory, MCP-1 and TNF-a expression, and microglial activation showed similar patterns to
the affected cerebral cortex (Fig 4-6A, D and G).
Telmisartan is a highly lipid-soluble angiotensin type 1
receptor blocker and is widely used for reducing BP
with a unique partial agonistic effect on peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Telmisartan
down-regulates angiotensin II type 1 receptor through
not only blocking AT1 but also by activating peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma.18 Therefore, telmisartan ameliorates multiple pathogenetic determinants
of atherosclerosis such as inflammation in the cerebral
cortex and in adipose tissue,7,8 and oxidative stresses in
the cerebral cortex and in adipose tissue.8,19-21 The
present study demonstrated that telmisartan significantly
reduced the inflammatory response in the brain of SHRSR after tMCAO (Figs 1-6, SHR/low and SHR/high). In
particular, a significant reduction of inflammation with a
low dose of telmisartan (SHR/low) suggests a pleiotropic
effect of telmisartan besides lowering BP.
In the present study, SHR-SR showed long-term inflammatory responses after a short period of tMCAO, which
may be due to both postischemic inflammation and
persistent hypertension (SHR/Ve). However, a low dose
of telmisartan still reduced inflammatory cytokine responses of MCP-1, TNF-a, and microglial activation
(Figs 1-6, SHR/low) with a few additional benefits,
namely the lowering of BP (Figs 1-6, SHR/high),
