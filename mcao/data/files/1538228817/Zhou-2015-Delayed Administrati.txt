Background and Purpose—Previous studies reported that Tat-NR2B9c, a peptide disrupting the N-methyl-d-aspartate
receptor–postsynaptic density protein-95 interaction, reduced ischemic damage in the acute phase after stroke. However, its
effect in the subacute phase is unknown. The aim of this study is to determine whether disrupting the N-methyl-d-aspartate
receptor–postsynaptic density protein-95 interaction in the subacute phase promotes recovery after stroke.
Methods—Studies were performed on Sprague-Dawley rats or nNOS−/− mice, and experimental ischemic stroke was induced
by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Animals were treated with drugs starting at day 4 after ischemia. Sensorimotor
functions and spatial learning and memory ability were assessed after drug treatment. Then, rats were euthanized for
morphological observation and biochemical tests.
Results—Disrupting the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor–postsynaptic density protein-95 interaction with Tat-HA-NR2B9c
significantly ameliorated the ischemia-induced impairments of spatial memory and sensorimotor functions in rats during
subacute stage but did not improve stroke outcome in nNOS−/− mice. Consistent with the functional recovery, Tat-HANR2B9c substantially increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and dendritic spine density of mature neurons in the
motor cortex of rats, meanwhile, reversed the ischemia-induced formation of S-nitrosylation-cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and
increased cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activity in ipsilateral hippocampus. However, directly blocking N-methyl-d-aspartate
receptors with MK-801 or Ro 25-6981 did not show the beneficial effects above.
Conclusions—Dissociating N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor–postsynaptic density protein-95 coupling by Tat-HA-NR2B9c
in the subacute phase after stroke promotes functional recovery, probably because of that it increases neurogenesis
and dendritic spine density of mature neurons via regulating cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in the ischemic brain.

NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx contributes to excitation–neurogenesis coupling.6 NMDAR activation is critical for neuroblast survival before entering a synaptic network.7 Deletion
of NMDARs leads to defects in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.8 Moreover, NMDARs contribute to synaptogenesis and
synapse stabilization9 and dendritic complexity of adult-born
neurons.10 Thus, directly inhibiting NMDARs may impair
endogenous mechanisms for brain repair.
Postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) is a scaffolding protein that binds both NMDARs and neuronal nitric
oxide synthase (nNOS) at excitatory synapses. This binding couples NMDAR activity to the production of NO, a
signaling molecule that mediates NMDAR-dependent
excitotoxicity.4,11 Interference peptide Tat-NR2B9c, which
comprises of the last 9 amino acids of the carboxyl tail of
GluN2B, one of the modulatory subunits of NMDARs, and
the 11-mer Tat protein transduction domain that renders

troke is a leading cause of death and adult-acquired disability. Many of the sensory, motor, and cognitive impairments caused by stroke eventually improve, suggesting an
ability of brain to rewire itself to restore lost functionalities.1
The modification of neuronal connections may result from
axonal sprouting, neurogenesis, or remodeling of dendritic
arbors.1–3 These raise the possibility that promoting regenerative repair, including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neural
regeneration, may improve stroke outcome even in a delayed
phase when options for early interventions have been missed.
Glutamate is the major excitatory transmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Immediately after ischemia,
glutamate accumulates at synapses and leads to excitotoxicity.4,5 N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) constitute
the major subtype of glutamate receptors.5 Thus, blockade of
NMDARs should be logically neuroprotective. Unfortunately,
NMDARs play an important role in neural circuit rebuilding.

the peptide plasma membrane permeable, disrupts the
NMDAR–PSD-95 interaction and thereby protects neurons
against NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity without affecting
NMDAR current, calcium loading,11,12 NMDAR-dependent
synaptic plasticity, or neuronal survival signaling.13 In
2008, it was reported that intravenously using Tat-NR2B9c
1 to 3 hours after stroke in rats reduced infarct volume and
improved neurological outcome.14 Moreover, in 2012, treatment with Tat-NR2B9c 1 hour after stroke in nonhuman
primates reduced infarct volume.15 Most importantly, it
was reported in 2012 that Tat-NR2B9c reduced the number
of iatrogenic ischemic infarcts in patients receiving endovascular repair for intracranial aneurysm.16 These findings
suggest that Tat-NR2B9c could be valuable for first aid of
stroke. However, it remains unknown whether Tat-NR2B9c
improves stroke outcome even administrated in a delayed
time frame when options for early interventions have been
missed. Recently, we prepared a recombinant chimeric
peptide Tat-HA-NR2B9c containing Tat-NR2B9c and a
influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope-tag and found that
treatment with Tat-HA-NR2B9c 1 hour after reperfusion
reduced infarct volume in rats subjected to middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO).17 Here, we show that a delayed
treatment with Tat-HA-NR2B9c after stroke substantially
ameliorated the ischemia-induced loss of dendrite spine in
the motor cortex, increased neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, and significantly improved sensorimotor
functions and cognitive abilities.

Materials and Methods
Drugs
Tat-HA-NR2B9c was prepared in our laboratory.17 MK-801 and RO
25-6981 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Animals
The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Nanjing Medical University. In this study,
adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g; B&K Universal Group
Limited, Shanghai) and nNOS-deficient (nNOS−/−) mice (B6; 129S4Nos1tm1Plh; stock number: 002633; Jackson Laboratories; maintained
at Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University, Nanjing,
China) were used. An experimenter labeled all animals before allocation. Experiments were performed by investigators who were blinded
to group allocation.

Surgical Preparation
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal MCAO as described previously.4,18 Before experiments, we did correlation analysis
between cerebral blood flow decline and neuroscore after MCAO to
control transient MCAO efficacy. There was a positive correlation between neuroscore and the percentage of cerebral blood flow decline
after stroke (n=14; R=−0.931; P<0.001; Figure I in the online-only
Data Supplement). Only animals with a certain degree of neurological deficits were used (more details are available in Methods in the
online-only Data Supplement).

Behavioral Assessment
Modified Neurological Severity Score test,19 Morris water maze task,
Barnes circular maze, grid-walking task, and cylinder task18 were performed as previously reported (more details are available in Methods
in the online-only Data Supplement).

Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence was performed as we previously reported18
(more details are available in Methods in the online-only Data
Supplement).

Biotin-Switch Assay
S-Nitrosylation (SNO) level of tissue protein was detected by biotinswitch assay as previously described18 (more details are available in
Methods in the online-only Data Supplement).

Western Blot Analysis
Western bolt analysis was performed as before.4 Primary antibodies were rabbit anti–cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5; 1:200; Santa
Cruz), rabbit anti-p35 (1:200; Santa cruz), mouse anti–histone H1
(1:200; Abcam), and mouse anti–phosphohistone H1 (1:1000;
Millipore). Internal control was mouse anti–β-actin (1:1000; SigmaAldrich). Appropriate horseradish peroxidase–linked secondary antibodies were used for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence
(Pierce).

Golgi-Cox Staining
Golgi-Cox staining was performed to show subtle morphological alterations in neuronal dendrites and dendritic spines.18 For morphological analysis, 8 neurons randomly for each sample were measured
and the average was regarded as the final value of one sample (more
details are available in Methods in the online-only Data Supplement).

Data Analysis
Comparisons among multiple groups were made with 1-way ANOVA
(1 factor) followed by Scheffe post hoc test. Data collected at repeating time points were analyzed by 2-way repeated measures
ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. Data were presented
as mean±SD; P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Disrupting the NMDAR–PSD-95 Interaction but
Not Directly Blocking NMDARs Improves Stroke
Outcome in the Delayed Phase
To examine whether a delayed treatment with Tat-HANR2B9c benefits stroke outcome, we subjected rats to MCAO
and treated them with Tat-HA-NR2B9c (1.12 mg/kg IV) for 7
days or selective noncompetitive NMDAR antagonist MK-801
(1 mg/kg IP) for 4 days starting at day 4 after MCAO. We used
MK-801 only for 4 days because treatment with MK-801 (1
mg/kg) for >4 days after stroke caused abnormal behaviors,
such as convulsion, salivation, and hypoactivity (data not
shown). Tat-HA-NR2B9c-, MK-801- or vehicle-treated rats
displayed similar infarct volume (31±7.1%; 33.6±7.6% versus 31.8±8.8%), suggesting no decreased damage when given
in the delayed manner. Sensorimotor functions were assessed
at days 11, 18, 32, and 46 after MCAO by forelimb foot faults
in grid-walking task and forelimb asymmetry in cylinder task.
Spatial cognitive performance in Morris water maze was measured during days 33 to 39 after MCAO (Figure 1A). Ischemia
significantly increased escape latency (F3,34=17.40; P<0.001),
decreased time spent in target quadrant (F3,34=10.21; P<0.001)
and target crossings (F3,34=16.40; P<0.001) in Morris water
maze (Figure 1B), and increased foot faults in the gridwalking task (F3,34=29.92; P<0.001; Figure 1C) and forelimb
asymmetry scores in the cylinder task (F3,34=144.19; P<0.001;
Figure 1D), compared with sham, suggesting impaired spatial

memory and sensorimotor functions. The delayed treatment
with Tat-HA-NR2B9c significantly ameliorated the ischemia-induced impairments of spatial memory (P=0.002, in
latency; P=0.004, in total time in target quadrant; P=0.023,
in target crossings) and sensorimotor functions (P=0.001, in
grid-walking task; P<0.001, in cylinder task), compared with
vehicle, whereas MK-801 did not (Figure 1B–1D), although
both of them significantly reduced infarct size and neurological deficit when immediately given after reperfusion (Figure
IIA–IIC in the online-only Data Supplement).
To further ascertain the improvement of spatial memory by
Tat-HA-NR2B9c, we used Barnes circular maze, a less physically taxing task than Morris water maze, to measure spatial
cognitive performance during days 33 to 39 and day 46 after
MCAO (Figure IIIA in the online-only Data Supplement).
Ischemia significantly increased escape latency and errors in
locating the hidden escape box (Figure IIIB and IIIC in the
online-only Data Supplement). All rats were able to remember the right target at day 39. However, when we assessed the
maintenance of the spatial memory 1 week later, we found
that Tat-HA-NR2B9c–treated rats still remembered the right
target, whereas MK-801-treated rats did not (Figure IIID in
the online-only Data Supplement).
MK-801 is an efficient blocker of both synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs.20 Stimulating synaptic NMDARs leads
to cAMP response element-binding protein activation and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor production.21 The inefficacy
of MK-801 in the delayed phase is likely due to the blockade of synaptic NMDARs. GluN2B-containing NMDARs are
enriched at extrasynaptic sites.13 Next, we investigated whether
a delayed treatment with GluN2B antagonist improves stroke

outcome. We subjected rats to MCAO and treated them with a
selective GluN2B antagonist Ro 25-6981 (3 mg/kg IV, a dose
being highly neuroprotective when used immediately after
reperfusion in MCAO rats [Figure IVA–IVC in the online-only
Data Supplement]) for 7 days starting at day 4 after MCAO.
Sensorimotor functions and spatial cognitive performance
were assessed at time points shown in Figure 1A. Similar to
MK-801, the delayed treatment with Ro 25-6981 did not ameliorate the ischemia-induced impairments of spatial memory
(F2,29=10.34 and P=1.000 in latency; F2,29=3.12 and P=0.927
in total time in target quadrant; F2,29=5.77 and P=0.935 in
target crossings) and sensorimotor functions (F2,29=130.79
and P=0.594 in grid-walking task; F2,29=41.08 and P=1.000
in cylinder task), compared with vehicle (Figure 2A–2C).
Taken together, our data strongly suggest that disrupting
the NMDAR–PSD-95 interaction but not directly blocking
NMDARs improves stroke outcome in the delayed phase.

Effect of Tat-HA-NR2B9c in the Delayed Phase is
nNOS Dependent
NMDAR–PSD-95–nNOS is the pivotal signal pathway
contributing to neurotoxicity after excessive stimulation of
NMDARs.12 Tat-NR2B9c disrupts the NMDAR–PSD-95
interaction11 and partly the PSD-95–nNOS interaction.4,22 So,
we next investigated whether the effect of Tat-HA-NR2B9c
in the delayed phase is nNOS dependent. We subjected
nNOS−/− mice to MCAO for 70 minutes and treated them with
Tat-HA-NR2B9c (1.5 mg/kg IV) for 7 days starting at day
4 after MCAO. Sensorimotor functions and spatial cognitive
performance were assessed at time points shown in Figure 1A.
Similar to functional impairments in rats, MCAO resulted in

NMDARs mediate neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity,
thereby contribute to memory formation.23–26 Accordingly,
we investigated whether delayed treatment with Tat-HANR2B9c increases neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. Rats
were treated with BrdU (100 mg/kg×2 IV; 24-h intervals) to
label proliferating cells during days 4 to 5 after MCAO and
euthanized for BrdU/NeuN staining or Golgi-Cox staining at
days 46 (Figure 4A). Tat-HA-NR2B9c given from days 4 to
10 after stroke substantially increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (F3,24=12.19; P=0.027) and reversed the ischemiainduced dendrite spine loss in the motor cortex (F3,16=15.11;
P=0.007), but MK-801 did not (P=0.997 in neurogenesis;
P=0.999 in spine density), compared with vehicle (Figure 4B
and 4C).
Moreover, neuroblasts migrating from the subventricular zone into the ischemic striatum after stroke contribute to
functional recovery.18 We thus examined the effect of TatHA-NR2B9c and MK-801 on the number of DCX+ (a marker
for immature neurons) cells in the striatum in MCAO rats.
Treatment with Tat-HA-NR2B9c but not MK-801 significantly increased the total number and the migration distance

Tat-HA-NR2B9c Reverses the Ischemia-Induced
Alteration of Cdk5

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

What is the underlying mechanism by which Tat-HANR2B9c improves regenerative repair? It is well accepted
that Cdk5 is involved in the regulation of dendritic spine
growth, neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity,27–29 and
exerts a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, including stroke.30 We thus investigated whether Tat-HA-NR2B9c
affects Cdk5 after ischemia. We subjected rats to MCAO
and measured levels of Cdk5 and histone H1 phosphorylation, which reflects the enzymatic activity of Cdk5, at
days 1, 4, 7, and 10 after MCAO in ipsilateral hippocampus. Ischemia caused a significant increase in Cdk5 activity (F4,15=8.47; P=0.626, 0.019, 0.003, and 0.048 for days
1, 4, 7, and 10 respectively; Figure 5A), although Cdk5 protein level did not change significantly (F4,15=1.89; P=0.916,
0.998, 0.987, and 0.642 for days 1, 4, 7, and 10 respectively;
Figure 5B). Moreover, ischemia did not change the level of
p35 (F4,15=2.55; P=0.672, 0.350, 0.806, and 0.989 for days
1, 4, 7, and 10 respectively; Figure 5C), a protein regulating
Cdk5 activity, compared with sham. To know how ischemia
activates Cdk5, we measured SNO of Cdk5, another way to
activate Cdk5.27 Indeed, ischemia led to remarkable increase
in SNO of Cdk5 in ipsilateral hippocampus (Figure 5D).
Therefore, ischemia stimulates Cdk5 activity via SNO
after stroke. Finally, we investigated the effect of Tat-HANR2B9c on Cdk5 activation. As expected, treatment with
Tat-HA-NR2B9c for 7 days starting at day 4 after MCAO
reversed the ischemia-induced formation of SNO-Cdk5
and increase in Cdk5 activity in ipsilateral hippocampus,
but MK-801 did not (F3,12=8.78, P=0.026, Tat-HA-NR2B9c
versus vehicle; P=0.986, MK-801 versus vehicle; Figure 6A
and 6D). Moreover, neither Tat-HA-NR2B9c nor MK-801
changed Cdk5 and p35 protein levels (Figure 6B and 6C).

Figure 5. Ischemia increases the level of S-nitrosylation
­(SNO)-cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) and Cdk5 activity.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) increased the activity
of Cdk5 (A) and formation of SNO-Cdk5 (D) in ipsilateral hippocampus on days 4, 7, and 10 after reperfusion. MCAO did not
influence the Cdk5 (B) and p35 (C) protein level in ipsilateral hippocampus on days 1, 4, 7, and 10 after reperfusion. As a positive
control, the hippocampus was treated with 200 μmol/L GSNO
and incubated for 30 minutes at 30ºC (n=4 for all groups). Data
are mean±SD (*P<0.05 and **P<0.01 vs sham).

Figure 6. Tat-HA-NR2B9c reverses the ischemia-induced alteration of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in ipsilateral hippocampus. Tat-HA-NR2B9c decreased Cdk5 activity (A) and formation
of SNO-Cdk5 (D) in ipsilateral hippocampus at day 10 after reperfusion. Tat-HA-NR2B9c did not affect Cdk5 (B) and p35
(C) protein level at day 10 after reperfusion. Control was not
treated with ascorbate. As a positive control, the hippocampus
was treated with 200 μmol/L GSNO and incubated for 30 minutes at 30ºC (n=4 for all groups). Data are mean±SD (*P<0.05 vs
sham; #P<0.05 vs vehicle; &P<0.05 vs MK-801).

Discussion
Although regenerative processes after stroke are activated
over months leading to a certain degree of functional recovery,
they are not enough to fundamentally change the life quality
of patients. New therapeutics may emerge from understanding
how to overcome inhibitory mechanisms that block regeneration. It is reported that dampening tonic inhibition by an α5GABAAR antagonist from day 3 after stroke showed reduced
cell death.31 However, studies concerned with delayed treatment are deficient.
Recently, we prepared a recombinant Tat-HA-NR2B9c peptide by genetic engineering techniques. The chimeric peptide
blocked the ischemia-induced NMDAR–PSD-95 association
and had potent neuroprotection in acute treatment of stroke.17
Here, we found that uncoupling NMDARs and PSD-95 by
Tat-HA-NR2B9c without directly blocking NMDARs in
the subacute phase could improve ischemia-induced impairments of spatial memory and sensorimotor functions, and
neurofunctional deficient (Figure VI in the online-only Data
Supplement). NMDAR activation mediates calcium influx,
cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation,
and brain-derived neurotrophic factor production, which are
necessary to neurogenesis, dendritic plasticity, and synaptogenesis.7,21,32 Therefore, directly inhibiting NMDARs might
be deleterious to animals and human.6–10 NMDAR activity is
unaffected by genetically deleting PSD-95 in vivo33 or by suppressing its expression in vitro.12 NMDAR-mediated EPSCs
are also unaffected when the nNOS–PSD-95 interaction is disrupted.4 These findings may explain why treatments with TatHA-NR2B9c and NMDAR antagonists in the subacute phase
had substantially different outcome for stroke.

NO donor and neuron-derived nNOS inhibit neural stem cell
proliferation and neuronal differentiation.34 Dissociating the
NMDAR–PSD-95 interaction by Tat-HA-NR2B9c decreases
the production of NO.11 Thus, enhancement of neurogenesis
in the ischemic hippocampus by delayed treatment with TatHA-NR2B9c may be because of inhibition of NO production.
Dysregulation of Cdk5 activity plays an important role
in the pathogenesis of stroke.30 SNO of Cdk5 directly regulates its activity and contributes to NMDAR-induced spine
loss and neuronal apoptosis.27 Our study showed that ischemia induced the formation of SNO-Cdk5 and increased
Cdk5 activity. Dissociating NMDAR–PSD-95 by Tat-HANR2B9c reversed the changes, thus increased dendritic
spine density in ischemic brain. However, NMDAR antagonist MK-801 had no effect on Cdk5 activity. It is reported
that stimulation of synaptic NMDARs leads to a decrease
in Cdk5 activity.35 NO production, and in turn, Cdk5 SNO
activate Cdk5. MK-801 blocks both synaptic NMDARs and
NMDAR–PSD-95–nNOS–NO pathway. These complex
effects of MK-801 may counteract each other and cause a
null-effect on Cdk5.
In this study, animals had similar latency to reach platform
in the visible platform trial, suggesting normal cued behavior
and, moreover, had similar swimming speed to locate the hidden platform, indicating no disturbances in gross motor skills
(Figure VII in the online-only Data Supplement).

Supplementary Methods
Surgical preparation
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal MCAO as described previously.1,2
Under chloralhydrate anesthesia (350 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), a 4/0 (for rats) surgical nylon
monoﬁlament with rounded tip was introduced into the internal carotid artery (ICA) through
the external carotid artery advanced 20-21 mm past the carotid bifurcation until a slight
resistance was felt, effectively occluding the middle cerebral artery, then the filament was
withdrawn after 120 min and the external carotid artery was ligated. Body temperature was
maintained at 37 ±0.5 ºC with a thermostatically controlled infrared lamp. Animals were then
returned to their cages and closely monitored until they recovered from anesthesia. Only
animals with a certain degree of neurological deficits were used. In sham-operated rats, the
ICA was surgically prepared for insertion of the ﬁlament, but the ﬁlament was not inserted.
Infarct volume measurement and neuroscore assessment
The neuroscore assessment and infarct volume measurement were performed 24 and 24.5 h
after MCAO respectively as described previously.1 In brief, brains were removed rapidly and
frozen at -20 ºC for 5 min. Coronal slices were made at 1-2 mm from the frontal tips, and
sections were immersed in 2% 2,3,5-tripenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma-Aldrich) at 37
ºC for 20 min. The presence or absence of infarction was determined by examining
TTC-stained sections for the areas on the side of infarction that did not stain with TTC.
Infarct volume was expressed as a percentage area of the coronal section in the infarct
hemisphere. Neuroscore assessment was performed by an experimenter blinded to the
experimental groups (Rating scale: 0 = no deficit, 1 = failure to extent left forepaw, 2 =
decreased grip strength of left forepaw, 3 = circling to left by pulling the tail, and 4 =
spontaneous circling).
Modified Neurological Severity Score (NSS) test
Measurement of neurological functional outcome was determined by the NSS test3. The score
was graded from 0 to 18 (normal score, 0; maximal deficit score, 18). Severe injury is
indicated by a score of 13 to 18, moderate injury 7 to 12, and mild injury 1 to 6. In the
severity scores of impairment, one point is scored for the inability to perform the task or
lacking proper response for a given reflex.
Correlation analysis between CBF decline and neuroscore
To determine whether MCAO is successful, regional CBF was monitored. We measured
baseline CBF (before ischemia) and CBF after insertion of the occluding filament (during
ischemia) and calculated the percentage of CBF decline (during ischemia/before ischemia).
Neuroscore assessment was performed after MCAO. Strength of association between the
CBF decline and neuroscore was estimated with Pearson correlation coefficient (R). The
overall correlation was R = -0.931 (P < 0.001). Our data showed that neuroscore correlated
well with the decline of CBF after MCAO. Thus, those animals whose neuroscore was lower
than 1 were excluded at d 1 after MCAO. Animals were randomly allocated to groups at d 4
2

(before drug administration) by computer-generated randomization schedules.
Morris water maze task
The protocol of Morris water maze task for rats was similar to that for mice, which has been
detailedly described in our previous study.1 During the visible platform trials, rats were
placed in the opaque water of the circular swimming pool (180 cm in diameter, Jiliang
Neuroscience Inc.), the platform was elevated 0.5 cm above the water level and marked by a
yellow label. The location of the visible platform varied for each trial. Four trials were
administered. The latency to reach the visible platform and swimming speed were measured.
Then, rats were trained to locate the hidden platform 1.2 cm under the surface of the water.
The room contained numerous cues on the walls, which remained constant throughout the
experiment, in order to aid animals in this spatial memory task. In the training to find the
hidden platform, rats were allowed to swim for maximum of 60 s in the pool for each trail.
One block of four trials per day was given for 5 consecutive days. Each trial was videotaped
via a ceiling-mounted video camera and the animal’s movement was tracked using
Ethovision software (Noldus Information Technology), which allows the calculation of
various measures such as latency (time to reach the platform). Next day, rats were given one
60-s retention probe test in which the platform was removed from the pool. During retention,
the number of crossings of the platform location and the time spent in the target quadrant
were measured.
Barnes circular maze
Spatial task performance was tested in the Barnes circular maze.4 This test was performed
from d 33 to d 39 and d 46 after MCAO. The test was conducted on a blue circular surface,
1.22 m in diameter, with 18 holes equally spaced around the perimeter. The circular open
field was elevated 75 cm from the floor. A blue Plexiglas escape box, which had paper cage
bedding on its bottom, was located under one of the holes. The hole above the escape box
represented the target, analogous to the hidden platform in the Morris task. The location of
the target was consistent for a given rat, but was randomized across rat. The maze was rotated
daily, with the spatial location of the target unchanged with respect to the distal visual room
cues, to prevent a bias based on olfactory or proximal cues within the maze. Two trials per
day were conducted for 6 successive days. At d 39, a probe trial was conducted without the
escape box, to confirm that this spatial task was acquired based on navigation using distal
environment room cues. One trial was conducted immediately after the probe test and 7 days
later another probe trial was conducted. The number of errors to reach the target hole and the
time spent around each hole were recorded by video tracking software.
Grid-walking task
The protocol of grid-walking task for rats was similar to that for mice, which has been
detailedly described in previous reports.2 Rat ran one trial per day at approximately the same
time each day. The grid area was 60 cm×60 cm×50 cm (length×width×height) with 30×30
mm diameter openings. Behavior was recorded using a camera that was placed underneath
the grid, in order to assess the animals’ stepping errors (i.e.‘footfaults’). Animals were given
5 min to walk atop the elevated wire surface. Footfaults for each limb were counted and
3

compared to the overall step number made by that limb. Thus, % footfaults was calculated by:
(#footfaults/#overall steps)×100%. A step was considered a footfault if it was not providing
support and the foot went through the grid hole.
Cylinder task
The cylinder task encourages use of the forelimbs for vertical wall exploration in a cylinder. 2
When placed in the cylinder, the animal rears to a standing position on the cylinder wall,
supporting its weight with either one or both of its forelimbs. A Plexiglas cylinder 30 cm in
height with a diameter of 20 cm was used. Animals were placed inside the cylinder and
videotaped for 5 min. The top of the cylinder was covered to prevent animals from jumping
out. A mirror was placed behind the cylinder at an angle to enable the rater to record forelimb
movements when the animal was turned away from the camera. Videotape of animals in the
cylinder was evaluated quantitatively in order to determine forelimb preference during
vertical exploratory movements. Behavior was scored by observers who were blind to the
treatment group of the animals in the study. While the videotape was played in slow motion
(1/5th real time speed), the total time (sec) each animal spent on the right forelimb, the left
forelimb, and simultaneous use of both forelimbs was assessed. Only wall placements that
could be clearly seen (both forelimbs in view) were timed. From these three measures, the
amount of time spent on either limb independently as well as the time the animal spent
rearing with both limbs on the wall, was derived. The percentage of time spent on each limb
was calculated, and these data were used to derive an asymmetry index (% ipsilateral use-%
contralateral use).
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence was performed as we previously reported.2 Animals were perfused
transcardially with 0.05 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 0.8% NaCl, followed by
4% paraformaldehyde in 0.05 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4, containing 0.8% NaCl). Brains
were removed and postﬁxed overnight in the same solution. Serial hippocampal sections (40
μm) were made on an oscillating tissue slicer in a bath of physiological saline. BrdU staining
has been described previously (Luo et al., 2005). The sections were heated (85 ºC for 5 min)
in antigen-unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories); incubated in 2 M HCl (37 ºC for 30
min); rinsed in 0.1 M boric acid, pH 8.5, for 10 min; and blocked in PBS containing 3%
normal goat serum, 0.3% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at
room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with primary antibodies at 4 ºC overnight.
The primary antibodies used were as follows: rat anti-BrdU (1:200; Accurate Chemical &
Scientific Corporation), mouse anti-NeuN (1:500; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents),
and rabbit anti-DCX (1:1000; Abcam). Subsequently, the sections were incubated with
secondary antibodies goat anti-rat Cy3 (1:200; Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents),
goat anti-mouse dylight 488 (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and goat anti-rabbit Cy3
(1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h at room temperature. An experimenter coded all
slides from the experiments before quantitative analysis. All BrdU+/NeuN+ cells and DCX+
cells were counted in each section by another experimenter blinded to the study code. The
analysis was conducted on every tenth section in a series of 40-μm coronal sections. To
determine the total number of BrdU+/NeuN+ cells or DCX+ cells, the counts from sampled
4

sections were averaged, and the mean values were multiplied by the total number of sections.
We used a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM700, Zeiss) to capture images and
confirm colocalization of BrdU+/NeuN+ cells.
Biotin-Switch Assay
This assay was performed in the dark as previously described.2 Briefly, cells were lysed in
HEN buffer (250 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA and 100 mM neocuproine) and adjusted
concentration as needed (not exceed 0.8 μg per μl). Samples were homogenized and free
cysteines were blocked for 1 h at 50 ºC in three volumes of blocking buffer (HEN buffer plus
2.5% SDS, HENS) containing methyl methanethiosulfonate (0.1%, Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins
were precipitated with three volumes of cold acetone at -20 ºC and washed with cold acetone
(3×5 ml) and resuspended in 240 μl HENS solution. After adding fresh ascorbic acid (20 mM,
Sigma-Aldrich) and biotin-HPDP (1 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), proteins were incubated at room
temperature for 1 h. Proteins were precipitated with three volumes of cold acetone at -20 ºC
and washed with cold acetone (4×1 ml). Alternatively, biotinylated proteins were resuspended
in 250 μl HENS buffer plus 750 μl neutralization buffer (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100) and precipitated with 30 μl prewashed avidin-affinity resin
beads (Sigma-Aldrich) at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were washed three times at
room temperature using neutralization buffer containing 600 nM NaCl. Biotinylated proteins
were eluted using 30 μl elution buffer (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100
mM β-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 100 °C for 5 min in reducing SDS-PAGE loading
buffer.
Golgi-Cox Staining
Golgi-Cox staining was performed with FD Rapid Golgi Stain TM Kit (FD
NeuroTechnologies) according to user manual.2 The fresh brains without perfusion and
fixation were used for Golgi-Cox staining to show subtle morphological alterations in
neuronal dendrites and dendritic spines. Large brain specimens should be sliced with a sharp
blade into blocks of approximately 10 mm thickness. Immerse brains in the impregnation
solution at room temperature for 2 weeks. Transfer tissue into Solution C and store at 4 ºC in
the dark for at least 48 hours. Then brains were cut into 100 μm coronal sections using a
vibratome (World Precision Instruments) and stained. For morphological analysis, eight
neurons randomly for each sample were measured and the average was regarded as the final
value of one sample.
