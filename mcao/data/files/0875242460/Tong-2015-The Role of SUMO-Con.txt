Abstract Preconditioning with volatile anesthetics can create
an ischemia tolerance against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
injury. We investigated whether ubiquitin conjugase 9 (Ubc9),
the E2 conjugase for SUMOylation, is associated with neuroprotection induced by isoflurane preconditioning (IsoPC). In
vitro, Ubc9 protein expression was evaluated at 4 and 24 h
after reoxygenation. The role of Ubc9 in the neuroprotective
effect was assessed in the presence or absence of Ubc9 small
interfering RNA (siRNA). In vivo, rats were preconditionally
exposed for 1 h to 2 % isoflurane for five consecutive days
followed by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurobehavioral scores and infarction volume were determined at different
times after reperfusion. The role of Ubc9 in ischemic tolerance
was evaluated by intracerebroventricular microinjection with
the Ubc9 siRNA. We showed that isoflurane preconditioning
improved the cell viability of the SH-SY5Y cells that were
challenged by oxygen-glucose deprivation. It also reduced
brain infarct volumes and improved neurologic outcomes in
the focal cerebral ischemic rat. The expression of Ubc9 was
upregulated by isoflurane preconditioning. Knockdown of
Ubc9 significantly attenuated the isoflurane preconditioninginduced neuroprotective effects. Isoflurane preconditioninginduced neuroprotection against ischemic injuries is mediated

Introduction
Perioperative stroke is one of the most significant complications of cardio-cerebral surgery, since it causes high mortality
and severe disability [1]. Ischemic preconditioning is a technique that activates cellular pathways and can help induce
tolerance to severe ischemia insults in the heart and brain [2].
Recently, our group and others have shown that exposing rats
to inhaled anesthetics, such as isoflurane or sevoflurane, prior
to ischemic insults can induce a tolerance to subsequent
ischemia in the brain [3], spinal cord [4], and heart [5]. As
volatile anesthetic agents have been proven safe in clinical
treatments, they may be applied as a more medically feasible
approach for preventing ischemic insults in the future. However, the exact molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying
the protective effects of preconditioning remain unclear.
In 2004, a novel protein degradation pathway,
ubiquitination, was found to have a crucial role in protein
modulation [6]. The ubiquitin pathway is the major nonlysosomal system for intracellular protein degradation. The
small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) modification pathway is similar to ubiquitin, and SUMOylation is modulated by
an enzymatic cascade analogous to that involved in
ubiquitination [7]. SUMO proteins act by covalent attachment
to lysine residues on larger proteins [8]. While several SUMO
enzymatic cascades that are specific to the respective target
proteins have been identified, ubiquitin conjugase 9 (Ubc9) is

1222

only SUMO-E2-conjugating enzyme. Therefore, Ubc9 is an
ideal target for activation or blockage of the SUMO modification pathway. Isopeptidases catalyze de-SUMOylation and
thus balance Ubc9 conjugation activities to modulate steady
state levels of SUMO conjugates [9, 10].
Recent evidence has shown that the target protein
SUMOylation has an important neuroprotective role in the
cellular response to cerebral ischemia injury. It was first identified that SUMO1- and SUMO2/SUMO3-targeted modification of cellular proteins occurs in the ground squirrel during
hibernating torpor, which suggests that SUMOylation may
also be involved in hibernation-mediated neuroprotective effects [11]. Other researchers have shown that global
SUMOylation, a posttranslational protein modification, occurs during ischemic tolerance in cultured cortical neurons
and animal brains [2, 12, 13]. Lee et al. showed that Ubc9
transgenic mice have elevated levels of SUMO conjugation in
the brain and increased resistance to brain ischemia compared
to wild-type mice [14]. It is therefore of key clinical interest to
identify the consequences of protein SUMOylation after preconditioning and ischemia to better understand the significance of this process in the fate of postischemic cells and
animals. Our previous study found that preconditioning with
isoflurane significantly alleviates cerebral ischemic injury by
inhibiting ubiquitin-conjugated protein accumulation following mouse models of global cerebral ischemia. However,
whether SUMOylation is associated with the neuroprotective
mechanisms induced by isoflurane preconditioning remains
unclear. Since evidence has suggested that the level of
Ubc9 protein was positively correlated with the degree
of SUMOylation, we hypothesized that Ubc9 (the sole
conjugase for SUMOs) target proteins have a role in the
mediation of the neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia afforded by isoflurane preconditioning. We tested this
hypothesis using both in vitro and in vivo experimental
settings.

Experimental Procedures
In Vitro
Experiment 1: Identification of the Alteration of Ubc9 Expression
in Differentiated SH-SY5Y Cells After Oxygen-Glucose
Deprivation (OGD) and Isoflurane Preconditioning Human
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were stimulated using all-trans
retinoic acid (RA) in culture for several days to allow them to
differentiate into neuron-like cells. They were then divided
into four treatment groups: sham, Iso (isoflurane alone), OGD,
and IsoPC (isoflurane preconditioning+OGD) groups. At
24 h after OGD, cell viability was evaluated. The cells were
harvested at 4 and 24 h after reoxygenation to measure the
expression of Ubc9 protein using Western blotting and
immunofluorescence.
Experiment 2: Verification of the Role of Ubc9 in
Mediating the Neuroprotective Effect Induced by
Isoflurane Preconditioning Against OGD in Differentiated
SH-SY5Y Cells Small interference RNA (siRNA) and lentivirus vectors were used. Cells were assigned to eight groups:
sham, Iso, OGD, IsoPC (isoflurane preconditioning+OGD),
siRNA+OGD, siRNA+IsoPC (siRNA+isoflurane preconditioning+OGD), lenti+OGD (lentivirus vector+OGD), and
lenti+IsoPC (lentivirus vector+isoflurane preconditioning+
OGD). The MTT assay was used 24 h after reoxygenation to
measure the viabilities of the neuron-like cells.
In Vivo
Experiment 1: Examination of Ubc9 Expression Following
Focal Cerebral Ischemia and Isoflurane Preconditioning in
the Rat Rats were randomly allocated to three groups (n=8
each): sham, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and
IsoPC (isoflurane preconditioning+MCAO). At 24 h, 48 h,
72 h, 7 days, and 14 days after reperfusion, functional neurologic outcomes were evaluated. Cerebral infarct volume was
observed at 72 h, 7 days, and 14 days. The other six rats from
each group were killed 4 h after reperfusion to evaluate Ubc9
protein expression.

Animals and Cells
All procedures were carried out according to the protocols
approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the Fourth Military Medical University (Xi’an, China)
and in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. SH-SY5Y cells
used in the in vitro experiments were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA,
USA). Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (280–320 g) were
purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of the Fourth
Military Medicine University.

Experiment 2: Verification of the Role of Ubc9 in Mediating
the Neuroprotective Effect Induced by Isoflurane Against
Focal Cerebral Ischemia in Rats We constructed a siRNA
against Ubc9. The reliability of the siRNA was tested in
normal rats before use. To investigate the impact of siRNA
on the neuroprotective effect of isoflurane pretreatment, the
rats were randomly divided into five groups: sham, MCAO,
IsoPC (isoflurane preconditioning+MCAO), siRNA+IsoPC
(Ubc9 siRNA +isoflurane preconditioning+MCAO), and
siRNA-c+IsoPC (control siRNA+isoflurane preconditioning+MCAO) groups. The effect of siRNA on functional

ischemia. Cerebral infarct volume was compared at 72 h after
ischemia-reperfusion among the different groups.

were stained with propidium iodide (PI). A FITC Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Pharmingen, USA) was used to
detect apoptosis.

Cell Culture and Characterization

Interference of Ubc9 on Cells

The human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, is often induced by stimulation with RA to differentiate into neuron-like
cells and has been used to imitate the responses of neurons
[15]. In the present study, exponentially growing SH-SY5Y
cells were kept in airtight, temperature-controlled cell culture
chambers built specifically for these experiments. Cells were
maintained in a mixture containing 1:1 Ham’s F12 and
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM
glutamine, 0.28 μg/μL of gentamicin, and 250 μg of
amphotericin B in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO2 in
air at 37 °C until 90 % confluence was reached. Then, 10 μM
of RA (1 % of the total volume, R2625; Sigma, St Louis MO,
USA) was added into the medium to stimulate the cells to
differentiate. Culture medium was replaced once every 2 days.

RNA interference experiments to suppress Ubc9 expression in
cells were performed using the FlexiTube siRNA Premix
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and processed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The following target sequence
was used: 5′-ACCACCATTATTTCACCCGAA-3′. Neuroblastoma cell lines were cultured in a 6-well plate at a density
of 3×105 cells/well for 24 h and transfected with 5.5 μg
siRNA using LipofectamineTM. After 48 h, siRNA validation
was determined using an assay for Ubc9 expression.
Viral particles were made in HEK-293 T cells (ATCC, cat.
no. CRL-11268) by cotransfection of the lentiviral vector
Ubc9 and the Packaging Plasmid Mix with LipofectamineTM
2000. The culture medium containing the packaged viruses
was harvested 48 h after transfection and spun at 3,000 rpm
for 20 min at 4 °C. The transduced cells were harvested after
72 h to check for RNA interference efficiency.

In Vitro Isoflurane Preconditioning and OGD
Transfection of siRNA into the Rat Brain
In the in vitro study, preconditioning was achieved by incubating the cells in 2 % isoflurane with 98 % O2 for 2 h [16].
Cells were then returned to the incubator filled with air and
5 % CO2 and continuously cultured for 24 h. To induce
ischemic injury, the neuron-like cells were subjected to
OGD treatment. Cultures were changed with prewarmed
OGD medium and then put into an airtight chamber at 37 °C
for 3 h. The OGD medium contained 116 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM
KCl, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 1.0 mM NaH2PO4, 1.8 mM CaCl2, and
26 mM NaHCO3 and was bubbled with 5 % CO2 and
95 % N2. OGD was terminated by removing cultures from
the chamber and changing the media back to the normal
culture medium. Cells were then cultured for an additional 2 h.
Assay of Cell Viability
Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay, a mitochondrial enzyme-dependent reaction. Briefly, MTT was added
to the cells cultured in 96-well plates after completion of the
experimental treatments. In metabolically active cells, the yellow tetrazolium MTT salt is cleaved into purple formazan
crystals. Thus, formed formazan can be solubilized and the
absorbance measured using a multiplate reader at 490 nm.

First, we tested the efficiency of the siRNA against Ubc9 in
normal rats. The following target sequence was used: 5′TTAGAGTAAATAAACTGTTTA-3′. We performed siRNA
transfections in the rats according to the method described by
Luo et al. [17].
After the efficiency of siRNA was verified, we assessed the
impact of administration of siRNA Ubc9 on the protective effect
of isoflurane preconditioning in the cerebral ischemic rat. Animals were randomly divided into five groups: sham (without
intervention), siRNA (Ubc9 siRNA), siRNA-c (control siRNA),
siRNA+IsoPC (Ubc9 siRNA followed by isoflurane preconditioning+MCAO), and siRNA-c+IsoPC (control siRNA followed by isoflurane preconditioning+MCAO).
Under pentobarbital anesthesia (40 mg/kg, i.p.), a stainless
steel cannula was stereotaxically implanted into the unilateral
cerebral ventricle. The stereotaxic coordinates of the lateral
cerebral ventricle were 1.0 mm posterior to the bregma and
1.2–1.5 mm lateral to the midsagittal line [18]. In total, 5 μL of
the diluted mixture was stereotaxically delivered into the
ipsilateral lateral ventricle. After recovering from anesthesia,
the rats were returned to their cages and allowed access to
food and water ad libitum. The animals were subjected to
subsequent treatments 24 h later.

Analysis of Cell Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry
Surgery for Transient Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
A Calibur Flow Cytometer system (BD Inc., USA) was used
to analyze the cell cycle distribution and apoptosis. The SHSY5Y cells used for the detection of cell cycle distribution

The transient MCAO model was performed as previously
described [19]. After an overnight rest, animals were

1224

anesthetized using 2 % isoflurane [20]. After the neck skin
was cut open and the carotid arteries were removed, transient
focal cerebral ischemia was induced by intraluminal suture
occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery with a 3-0 monofilament nylon suture (Ethicon, Inc., Osaka, Japan). After
120 min of MCAO, the suture was carefully removed from
the internal carotid artery. Sham-operated rats underwent the
same surgical procedure except that the suture was not
inserted into the internal carotid artery. The cerebral blood
flow (CBF) in parietal cortex was continuously monitored
with laser Doppler flowmetry (PeriFlux 5000, Sweden). The
rat was considered as a successful model when its CBF
reduced to 30 % of the basal value.
Isoflurane Preconditioning In Vivo
For the in vivo study, preconditioning of the rats was achieved
by inhalation of 2 % isoflurane+98 % O2 1 h/day for 5 days
[21]. Animals in the control group were treated for the same
duration but were allowed to inhale 98 % O2 only.
Measurement of Physiologic Parameters
As isoflurane inhalation may induce hypoxia, it was necessary
to rule out hypoxia-induced preconditioning. Therefore, in a
separate experiment, ten additional rats were used to measure
blood gases during isoflurane preconditioning (n=5) or oxygen inhalation (n=5). A PE-10 cannula (Becton Dickinson
and Company, Rutherford, NJ, USA) was inserted into the left
femoral artery using a carrier amplifier connected to an invasive pressure monitor (Spacelabs Medical, Inc., Redmond,
WA, USA). Arterial blood gas samples were collected at the
beginning, during, and just before termination of preconditioning. Samples were then measured using an OMNI Modular System (AVL List GmbH Medizintechnik, Kleiststrasse,
Graz, Austria).
Since the surgical procedure of the MCAO model was very
short (average time for intraluminal suture insertion was 5 min
and the removal time was 1–2 min), the physiological parameters were not measured during the surgical procedure according to previous reports [22]. However, a separate experiment
was undertaken to measure the physiological parameter
changes during isoflurane preconditioning. The results
showed that no significant differences in physiological parameters were found between the sham and MCAO groups (data
not shown).
Evaluation of Neurologic Scores and Measurement of Infarct
Volume
Neurologic scores were evaluated by using a scoring system
reported by Garcia et al. [23]. This system consisted of the
following six tests: (1) spontaneous activity, (2) symmetry in

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 51:1221–1231

the movement of four limbs, (3) forepaw outstretching, (4)
climbing, (5) body proprioception, and (6) response to vibrissae touch. The final score given to each rat at the completion
of the evaluation was the summation of all six individual test
scores. The minimum neurologic score was 3 and the maximum score was 18.
To compare the infarct sizes among differently treated
groups, the infarct volume was measured using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA) as described in our previous report [21].
Infarct and total hemispheric sections were traced from slices
taken at 2-mm intervals and measured using an image analysis
system (Adobe Photoshop 8.0, Adobe Systems Incorporated,
San Jose, CA, USA). The infarct volume was calculated using
Swanson’s method to correct for edema: 100×(contralateral
hemisphere volume−non-lesioned ipsilateral hemisphere volume)/contralateral hemisphere volume [24] and presented as
mean±SEM.
Western Blot
In the first part of the experiment, to assess the expression of
Ubc9 proteins, cells seeded in 75 cm3 bottles at a density of
5×106 were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and resuspended in a Tris buffer (pH 7.0) containing protease
inhibitors (Roche, F. Hoffmann-La, Basel, Switzerland). After
sonication, 20 μg of the total protein extracts were separated
by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane.
Thereafter, non-specific binding was blocked with 5 % bovine
serum albumin in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit antiUbc9 (1:2000, ab6046; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and rabbit
anti-β-actin (1:4000, ab6046; Abcam), respectively. After
rinsing, the membranes were incubated with an anti-rabbit
secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Bands were
visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescence Substrate from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA).
In the second part of the experiment, to examine the expression of Ubc9, the animals were decapitated and the cerebral cortex was rapidly harvested. Subsequent protocols were
the same as above.
Immunocytofluorescence Staining
In the in vitro experiment, at the end of treatment, cells were
grown on 22-mm sterilized glass coverslips fixed with 4 %
paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then thoroughly rinsed with
PBS. Non-specific binding sites were blocked with 5 % (v/v)
normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The
coverslips were then incubated with appropriate dilutions of
primary antibodies in PBS for 24 h at 4 °C. The primary
antibodies used were rabbit anti-Ubc9 (1:200). The sources

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 51:1221–1231

of primary antibodies were the same as those used in the
Western blotting procedures. Then, the coverslips were
washed with PBS and incubated with suitable secondary
antibodies conjugated with fluorescence for 2 h at room
temperature. The cellular nuclei were counterstained with
DAPI. The coverslips were then washed extensively and
mounted on glass slides with anti-fading medium for image
observation and analysis. Images were captured with a Nikon
E600 fluorescent microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical Analysis
SPSS 13.0 for Windows was used to carry out statistical
analyses. All values, except for neurological scores, are presented as mean±SEM and were analyzed by one-way analysis
of variance. The neurological scores were expressed as the
median (range) and were analyzed with the Kruskal–Wallis
test followed by the Mann–Whitney U test with Bonferroni
correction. Values of p<0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Results
Isoflurane Preconditioning Induces Neuroprotection
Against OGD In Vitro
We first investigated the neuroprotective effects of isoflurane
preconditioning in vitro by MTT assay and flow cytometry
analysis. The results of cell viability and apoptosis revealed
that isoflurane preconditioning alleviated differentiated SHSY5Y cell death induced by 3 h of OGD injury (p<0.05;
Fig. 1a). Quantitative analysis of the neuron-like cells revealed
that 2 h of isoflurane preconditioning given prior to OGD
exposure significantly decreased cell apoptosis, compared
with that in OGD injured alone (p<0.05; Fig. 1b, c).
Isoflurane Preconditioning Altered the Expression of Ubc9
In Vitro
We investigated the effects of isoflurane preconditioning on
the expression of Ubc9 (SUMO E2 conjugation enzyme)
using Western blotting. The results showed that the incubation
with OGD decreased the levels of Ubc9 protein in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. The expression of Ubc9 levels was
significantly reduced at 3 h after OGD (p<0.05), but there
was no statistical difference between the sham group and the
24-h OGD group. The reduction of Ubc9 protein expression
induced by OGD was attenuated by isoflurane preconditioning (Fig. 2a). We also investigated the expression of Ubc9
protein 3 h after OGD using immunofluorescence, and these
images showed the same results (Fig. 2b). Moreover,

1225

isoflurane preconditioning triggered nuclear translocation of
the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 (Fig. 2c).

Manipulation of Ubc9 Levels Affects Isoflurane-Induced
Neuroprotection
First, to validate the efficiency of RNA interference, the
expression of Ubc9 expression was evaluated by Western
blotting (Fig. 3a; p<0.01). Next, the neuroblastoma cells were
transfected with siRNA for 24 h prior to the exposure of
isoflurane or treatment of OGD injury. The cell viability was
assessed 24 h after OGD using the MTT assay. For neuroblastoma cells only subjected to 3-h OGD, cell viability of Ubc9
siRNA-transfected cells was lower than that of nontransfected cells (p<0.05); however, there was no statistical
difference between Ubc9-overexpressed cells and nontransfected cells. When subjected to isoflurane preconditioning plus OGD injury, Ubc9 lentivirus-transfected cells showed
a 6.47 % increase in cell viability compared to non-transfected
cells (p< 0.05). However, Ubc9 siRNA-transfected cells
showed a 9.86 % decrease in cell viability (p<0.05). The
results showed that a knockdown of Ubc9 can attenuate the
neuroprotective effect of isoflurane preconditioning and upregulation of Ubc9 was effective in improving survival of
cells.

Isoflurane Preconditioning Improved Neurologic Scores
and Reduced Infarct Volume in Rats with MCAO
Changes in physiologic parameters during isoflurane preconditioning and controlled oxygen inhalation are shown in
Table 1. There were no statistical differences between the
isoflurane inhalation and oxygen inhalation groups among
the corresponding time points. Rats preconditioned with 2 %
isoflurane 1 h/day for 5 days had significantly smaller brain
infarct volumes than those without isoflurane precondionintg
at 72 h and 7 days after the MCAO (p<0.05). There were no
significant differences between the MCAO 14-day and IsoPC
14-day groups (Fig. 4a). Consistent with the neuropathological data, isoflurane preconditioning also improved the neurological manifestation at 24, 48, 72 h, 7, and 14 days after
MCAO (p<0.05; Fig. 4c).

Isoflurane Preconditioning Reversed the Decline of Ubc9
Expression Induced by MCAO
The expression level of Ubc9 in the brain significantly decreased 4 h after MCAO surgery, compared with the sham
group. Isoflurane preconditioning significantly reversed this
decrease (p<0.05; Fig. 5).

Downregulation of Ubc9 Attenuated Isoflurane-Induced
Neuroprotection Against Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury

At 24 h after intracerebroventricular microinjection of
Ubc9 siRNA, the animals were subjected to subsequent treatments 24 h after reperfusion. Ubc9 siRNA (siRNA+IsoPC
group) showed increased cerebral infarct volumes compared
with those microinjected with nonsense siRNA (siRNA-c+
IsoPC group) (Fig. 6c; p<0.05). Ubc9 siRNA attenuated the
improvement of the neurobehavioral manifestation induced
by isoflurane preconditioning at the time points examined, as
shown by the neurologic scores (Fig. 6d). Also, there were no
detectable differences between the siRNA + IsoPC and

To verify the efficiency of siRNA in vivo, Ubc9 siRNA or
nonsense siRNA was stereotaxically injected into the lateral
ventricle. At 48 h after injection, the rat brain was harvested to
measure the efficiency of siRNA using Western blotting. We
found that Ubc9 siRNA significantly reduced the expression
of Ubc9 protein (p<0.01), but nonsense siRNA had no such
effect (Fig. 6a).

MCAO groups in infarct volumes (p>0.05), indicating that
Ubc9 has an active role in the anti-ischemia-reperfusion injury
effect of isoflurane preconditioning.

Despite the benefit of ischemic preconditioning on attenuating the ischemic injury, its application is still invasive and
impractical in brain ischemia for clinical practice. Therefore,
many non-ischemic preconditioning maneuvers have recently
been investigated in vitro and in vivo. Our previous studies
have shown that preconditioning with hyperbaric oxygen and
volatile anesthetic agents, such as sevoflurane and isoflurane,
can induce ischemic tolerance in cerebral [25, 26] and spinal
cord ischemia [4]. Since the volatile anesthetics have been
widely used in surgery procedures, volatile anesthetic preconditioning has the potential to be a practicable method for
preventing perioperative ischemic reperfusion injury. The
mechanism of isoflurane preconditioning involves antioxidative pathways and K-ATP and TREK-1 channel activation [27, 28]. However, the underlying mechanism, especially
the protein modulation after isoflurane preconditioning, remains unclear.
Evidence suggests that the ubiquitin proteasome system
and SUMOylation are important for neuroprotective stress
responses under conditions of transient cerebral ischemia.

Discussion
The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the
SUMO E2 conjugation enzyme, Ubc9, is involved in the
neuroprotective effect of isoflurane preconditioning against
cerebral ischemic injury. We discovered that ischemic injury
significantly decreased the level of Ubc9 protein and
isoflurane preconditioning can reverse this decrease. The ischemic tolerance induced by isoflurane preconditioning is
diminished by the downregulation of Ubc9 via RNA interference. This indicates that changes in the pattern of protein
modification by SUMO E2 conjugation enzyme Ubc9 are
involved in the induction of the neuroprotective effect by
isoflurane preconditioning.

Our previous study found that inhibition of ubiquitinconjugated protein aggregation is involved in the formation
of cerebral ischemic tolerance by isoflurane preconditioning

[21]. However, whether SUMOylation is involved and the
precise targets of SUMO conjugation in ischemic tolerance
induced by isoflurane preconditioning have not been previously identified.
The SUMO conjugation pathway relies on enzymes, such
as E1 and E2. Since Ubc9 is believed to be the only SUMOconjugating enzyme, it is an important target to activate or
block SUMO conjugation. Overexpressing or downregulation
of Ubc9 has been used to explore the possible role of
SUMOylation under certain experimental conditions
[29–31]. In the present study, we showed that downregulation
of Ubc9 via RNA interference can reverse the neuroprotective
effect of isoflurane preconditioning. Our results also indicated
that isoflurane preconditioning significantly elevated Ubc9
expression in the early stage of reperfusion or reoxygenation
in vivo and in vitro. These findings indicate that SUMO
conjugation is involved in the neuroprotection of isoflurane
preconditioning.
Recent findings have shown that a number of cell-signaling
pathways may be the target of SUMO-dependent signaling
processes and recovery following ischemic stroke, as well as
showing a tightly controlled cross talk between the ubiquitin
and SUMO conjugation systems [32]. Deep hypothermia
which exhibits neuroprotection against ischemic injury induced the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 nuclear

translocation, indicating that the increase of SUMOconjugated proteins level in the nucleus [33]. These results
suggest that activation of SUMO conjugation through the
increase and translocation of Ubc9 might help cells withstand
the stress conditions caused by a transient period of hypoxia.
However, available evidence did not clearly show whether
Ubc9 was a cause or consequence of the neuroprotection.
Although Ubc9 is known to be the only E2 conjugase, there
have been many reports identifying Ubc9 as a multifunctional
protein that is independent of its role as a SUMOylationconjugating enzyme. It can act as a regulator of nuclear
transport, a transcriptional cofactor, or a helper for virus
production [34]. SUMOylation broadly affects the biological
network, and the process of SUMO conjugation is reversible
and highly dynamic. Therefore, it is unclear how these complex processes are altered in the context of ischemia, preconditioning, and tolerance. Although mechanisms for OGDregulated SUMOylation are still unknown, we can speculate
that it will require posttranslational modification or differential
expression of components of the SUMO conjugation machinery. Small ubiquitin-like modifier modification has been described to actively participate in NFκB regulation, and Liu

et al. [35] documented that adenosine signaling resulted in
significant accumulation of SUMOylation with subsequent
attenuation of NFκB activation using models of hypoxia
followed by reoxygenation. Other researchers have found that
the internalization of GluK2 following SUMO modification
activated the MLK3–JNK3 pathway, which may be responsible for ischemic neuronal cell death [36]. Moreover, protein
SUMOylation has an important and previously unsuspected
role in synaptic trafficking of AMPARs that underlies homeostatic scaling to alter synaptic transmission to compensate for
changes in network activity [37]. Cimarosti et al. [38] investigated posttranslational modification by SUMO and discovered that downregulation of AMPARs and KARs may have
important roles in the pathophysiological responses to ischemia in different animal stroke models. What remains unclear
is whether SUMOylation of proteins following ischemia is
part of a protective process or the cause of cell death.
In conclusion, the data from our present study show that
preconditioning with isoflurane protects neurons from ischemic injury and this effect is partly mediated by Ubc9, suggesting that protein SUMOylation is involved in the cellular
response to ischemia tolerance. However, in the absence of

1230

Ubc9 specifically activating or inhibiting SUMO conjugation,
resolution of questions concerning the signaling properties of
posttranslational modification will require further studies in
transgenic animals.
