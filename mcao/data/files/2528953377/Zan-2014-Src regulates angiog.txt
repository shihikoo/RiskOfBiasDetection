The Src family comprises a subclass of membraneassociated non-receptor tyrosine kinases that are
involved in a variety of cellular signal transduction
pathways (Thomas and Brugge, 1997), including gene
transcription, adhesion regulation, cell proliferation, and
angiogenesis (Brown and Cooper, 1996; Schlessinger,
2000; Theus et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2007). One study
has reported that Src kinase activity correlates with
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated
vascular permeability and brain damage after
permanent focal cerebral ischemia in mice (Paul et al.,
2001). Using the same model in rats, we further
identiﬁed that the expression of Src correlates with
VEGF and angiopoietin expression, and with cerebral
edema formation (Zan et al., 2011). However, the exact
contribution of Src Y418 phosphorylation to vascular
permeability after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
remains to be established.
VEGF is an endothelial mitogen as well as a potent
mediator of vascular permeability (Schoch et al., 2002).
Therefore, it may contribute to brain edema associated
with ischemia and reperfusion. The angiopoietins
represent another family of proteins that play an
essential role in angiogenesis. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1)
and
angiopoietin-2
(Ang-2)
have
been
well
characterized. Ang-1 is required for blood vessel
stabilization and maturation and acts as an antipermeability factor to prevent vascular leakage (Davis
et al., 1996; Suri et al., 1996; Risau et al., 1998). In
contrast, endogenous Ang-2 serves as a natural
inhibitor of Ang-1 activity, disrupting vessel integrity and
promoting disassembly of the cellular components (Pfaﬀ
et al., 2006). Although these angiogenic factors play
critical roles in maintaining vascular integrity, their
upstream regulators need to be identiﬁed.
To better understand the pathologic role of Src and its
possible mechanism of action in cerebral ischemia and

Abstract—Developing new strategies to treat cerebral ischemic–reperfusion injury will require a better understanding of
the mechanisms that underlie vascular permeability. In this
study we examined the temporal expression of Src and
angiogenic factors in rat brain after focal cerebral ischemia
and reperfusion and analyzed the relationships among
those factors. We also investigated the eﬀect of Src inhibitor
PP1
(4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4d]pyrimidine) in ischemic reperfusion. Rats were subjected
to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 min followed by
reperfusion with or without PP1 treatment. Src mRNA
increased at 3 h after reperfusion and then gradually
declined. Phosphorylation of Src at Y418 displayed a biphasic increase. Phosphorylation increased as early as 3 h and
peaked at 6 h; after decreasing, it peaked again at 3–7 days.
Increases in Src mRNA and phosphorylation correlated positively with levels of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), and negatively with levels of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1).
Changes in the expression of these factors correlated with
the progress of vascular permeability, especially early after
reperfusion. Hence, dynamic temporal changes in Src
Y418 phosphorylation may modulate vascular permeability
after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. PP1 eﬀectively

reperfusion, we characterized the temporal proﬁle of Src
mRNA expression and Y418 phosphorylation and the
expression of angiogenic factors at mRNA and protein
levels after focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in
rats, and analyzed the possible correlations among
them. Additionally, using the same model, we
investigated the eﬀect of Src inhibitor PP1 (4-amino-5(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) on
Src mRNA expression and Y418 phosphorylation,
vascular permeability, brain edema formation, lesion
volume, and neurologic function.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and ischemia–reperfusion model
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g
were purchased from the Center of Experimental
Animals. The rats were housed under standard
conditions with free access to rat chow and tap water
before and after surgery. All experimental procedures
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. All eﬀorts were made to minimize animal
suﬀering, to reduce the number of animals used, and to
use alternatives to in vivo techniques.
The rats were randomized into two groups: the shamoperated control group and the ischemia–reperfusion
model group. Animals were anesthetized with 10%
chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.) and then underwent
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with
the ﬁlament model as previously described (Longa
et al., 1989). Body temperature of the rats was
continuously monitored and maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5 °C
with a heating pad during and after the surgery.
Reperfusion was induced after 90 min of ischemia by
removing the ﬁlament. Rats in the ischemia–reperfusion
group were subdivided into seven subgroups based on
the duration of reperfusion: 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 1 day, 3 days,
7 days, or 14 days. At each of these time points after
reperfusion, one subgroup of rats was anesthetized;
brains were quickly removed after decapitation. Shamoperated rats underwent anesthesia and surgery without
the ﬁlament insertion.
Treatment with PP1
To address the role of Src in ischemia–reperfusioninduced brain damage and the potential underlying
mechanisms, we investigated the eﬀects of the Src
inhibitor
PP1.
PP1
is
a
cell-permeable
pyrazolopyrimidine compound that inhibits Src family
tyrosine kinases Lck, Fyn, Hck, and Src (IC50 = 5, 6,
20, and 170 nM, respectively). Its molecular weight
(MW) is 281.36, and its chemical formula is C16H19N5.
PP3 (4-amino-7-phenylpyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), an
inactive analog of PP1 (MW = 211.2; C11H9N5), inhibits
the activity of EGFR kinase (IC50 = 2.7 lM) and was
used as a negative control for PP1. PP1 and PP3 were
freshly dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
further diluted in phosphate-buﬀered saline (ﬁnal
dilution, 0.1% DMSO) just before surgery. Rats were
randomly assigned to receive PP1 (1.5 mg/kg), PP3

119

(1.5 mg/kg), or an equal volume of vehicle (0.1%
DMSO) by intraperitoneal injection 30 min before
surgery (Kusaka et al., 2004). The rats were euthanized
by decapitation 1 day after reperfusion.
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from the ipsilateral cerebral
cortex (n = 6/group) by TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). The Transcriptor First Stand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Roche, USA) was used for the reverse
transcription reactions. Using 1 lg of total RNA for each
sample, we synthesized the cDNA according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Then 2 lL of the reverse
transcription reaction was used for PCR ampliﬁcation in
a volume of 20 lL. The reactions contained genespeciﬁc primers for Src forward: 50 -AGA GTG CCC TAT

TAC CC-30 . All reactions were carried out in a thermal
cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) under the following
conditions: 5 min at 94 °C, 40 cycles of ampliﬁcation
(94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s), and
72 °C for 10 min. All products were separated on 2%
agarose gels containing 0.5 lg/mL ethidium bromide.
Band intensities were evaluated by the Chemidoc XRS
imaging densitometer system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)
and quantiﬁed with Quantity One software.
Western blot analysis
Protein was extracted from ipsilateral cerebral cortex
(n = 6/group) with lysis buﬀer. Equal amounts of total
protein extract were loaded onto sodium dodecyl sulfate
(10%) polyacrylamide gels and separated by
electrophoresis. Protein was then transferred to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes by electroblotting.
After being blocked for 2 h with 5% nonfat dried milk in
Tris-buﬀered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the
membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit
polyclonal anti-Src (phospho-Y418, 1:600; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-Ang-2
(1:800; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1 (1:600;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
mouse monoclonal anti-VEGF (1:1000; Abcam), or goat
polyclonal anti-Ang-1 (1:800; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Membranes were then washed and incubated with
secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
expression was determined as an internal control.

analysis
software.
Three
independent
experiments were duplicated.
Immunohistochemistry
Rats were perfused transcardially with saline followed by
4% paraformaldehyde, and their brains were removed
and post-ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight before
being embedded in paraﬃn. A series of 4-lm-thick
sections was cut from the block and used for
immunohistochemical staining. Selected sections at 2.0,
0, and 2.0 mm from the bregma were incubated
overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal anti-Src
(phospho-Y418, 1:100; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal antiAng-2 (1:200; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-ZO-1
(1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal
anti-VEGF (1:200; Abcam), or goat polyclonal anti-Ang1 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then in the
appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h. Staining was
visualized with diaminobenzidine (Maixin Bio, China).
Sections used as negative controls were processed in
parallel but were not exposed to primary antibody.
Immunoreactive cells or microvessels were counted
around the infarct region under a 40 objective for
pSrc, Ang-1, Ang-2, VEGF, and ZO-1 from 18 locations
per rat (6 ﬁelds per slice  3 slices per rat).
Quantiﬁcations were averaged and expressed as
positive cells or microvessels/40 ﬁeld (n = 7 rats/
group). To target similar regions of interest, slices with
similar lesion area were selected and analyzed by an
investigator blinded to the experimental cohort.
Measurement of vascular permeability
Vascular permeability was quantitatively assessed by
spectrophotometric measurement of Evans Blue (EB)
extravasation. The vascular permeability was assessed
from 3 h to 14 days after reperfusion. EB (2%; 4 mL/kg)
was injected over 2 min into the right femoral vein and
allowed to circulate for 60 min. The animals were then
killed after the induction of deep anesthesia. The
amount of extravasated EB in homogenate from the
ipsilateral cortex was determined spectrophotometrically.
Measurements were conducted at an excitation
wavelength of 620 nm, an emission wavelength of
680 nm, and a bandwidth of 10 nm.
Measurement of brain water content
To evaluate the eﬀect of PP1 on brain edema after
ischemia and reperfusion, we calculated the water
content as the weight diﬀerence between wet and dry
samples. Animals (n = 7 rats/group) were deeply
anesthetized and decapitated 1 day after reperfusion.
The brains were removed and immediately weighed to
obtain the wet weight. Then they were dried at 100 °C
for 48 h and reweighed to obtain the dry weight. The
percentage of water in the forebrain was calculated as

follows: (wet weight  dry weight)/wet weight  100%
(Wang and Dore, 2007).
Measurement of infarct volume
To evaluate the eﬀect of PP1 on infarct volume after
ischemia
and
reperfusion,
we
administered
intraperitoneal injections of PP1 30 min before the
induction of cerebral ischemia. Rats were decapitated
according to the scheduled time. Brains were removed
and placed at 20 °C for quick freezing. Brains were
then sectioned from front to back into ﬁve 2-mm slices.
The slices were stained in 2% TTC solution at 37 °C
and ﬁxed in formaldehyde. Viable brain tissue was
stained red, whereas the ischemic area remained
unstained (white). Each slice was photographed under a
microscope, and infarct volume was calculated with an
HPIAS2100 image analysis system.
Measurement of neurologic function
To evaluate the eﬀect of PP1 on neurologic function, we
assessed the neurologic scores of the rats according to
Longa’s neurological score criteria (Longa et al., 1989).
In this scoring system, 0 = no deﬁcit, 1 = failure to
extend left forepaw fully, 2 = circling to the left,
3 = falling to the left, 4 = no spontaneous walking and
a depressed level of consciousness. Rats were
eliminated from the study if they were bleeding, had
diﬃculty breathing, had brain subarachnoid hemorrhage,
or died prematurely.
Statistical analysis
Parametric data are presented as the mean ± standard
deviation. Parametric data, including the expression of
Src, VEGF, Ang-1, Ang-2, and ZO-1 at diﬀerent time
points after ischemia and reperfusion, EB extravasation,
brain water content, and infarct volume, were analyzed
by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the
Bonferroni post hoc test. Neurologic deﬁcit scores are
presented as medians with interquartile ranges (25th
and 75th percentiles) and were analyzed by using the
non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis analysis of ranks. The
Pearson correlation was used to determine the strength
of association among the target proteins examined.
SPSS 13.0 software was used for statistical analysis.
Statistical signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05.

RESULTS
Temporal changes of Src mRNA and Y418
phosphorylation in rat brain after ischemia and
reperfusion
Compared with control levels, the expression of Src
mRNA was markedly increased at 3 h after reperfusion
(p < 0.05), persisted at a high level until 12 h, and then
gradually declined to the basal level at 1 day (Fig. 1A).
However, the increase in Src Y418 phosphorylation was
biphasic. It increased signiﬁcantly as early as 3 h,
reached a maximum at 6 h and remained high for up to
12 h after reperfusion. After decreasing, it had a second

peak at 3–7 days and then returned to the basal level at
14 days (p < 0.05; Fig. 1B). Immunohistochemistry
showed that phosphorylated Src was nearly absent in
sham-operated rat brain. However it was expressed in
glial-like and endothelial-like cells at 6 h and 7 days after
reperfusion, particularly in the peri-infarct region
(Fig. 1C). Quantiﬁcation analysis showed a similar trend
of the protein expression of pSrc after reperfusion
(Fig. 1D).

Expression of VEGF and angiopoietins after ischemia
and reperfusion
VEGF mRNA expression also exhibited upregulation after
ischemia and reperfusion. It was markedly increased at
3 h, had a peak at 6 h, and then decreased gradually
after 12 h; it had a second peak at 7 days and then
returned to the basal level at 14 days (p < 0.05;
Fig. 2A). Protein expression followed a similar trend.
Western blot analysis indicated that VEGF protein
underwent a marked increase at 6 h after reperfusion
and then began to decrease gradually (p < 0.05;
Fig. 2B). Immunoreactivity of VEGF was mainly
observed in neuron-like and glial-like cells in the periinfarct region (Fig. 2C) and followed a trend similar to
that shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D).
Ang-2 mRNA increased signiﬁcantly as early as 3 h
after reperfusion, peaked at 12 h, and persisted at high
levels until 1 day (p < 0.05). The level then decreased

rapidly and remained at baseline from 3 days until the
end of the experimental period at 14 days (Fig. 2A).
Ang-2 protein also increased at 3 h and peaked at 12 h
after reperfusion. It then decreased signiﬁcantly to the
basal level at 1 day (p < 0.05, Fig. 2B). Ang-2 was
primarily expressed in neuron-like and glial-like cells in
the peri-infarct region (Fig. 2C), and changes in the
number of Ang-2-positive cells conﬁrmed the results of
Western blotting (Fig. 2D). Ang-1 mRNA was
signiﬁcantly decreased from baseline at 6 h after
reperfusion (p < 0.05) and remained depressed for up
to 1 day (p < 0.05). It returned to control levels by
3 days after reperfusion (Fig. 2A). Ang-1 protein also
decreased after ischemia and reperfusion, reaching a
minimum at 1 day (p < 0.05; Fig. 2B). It then gradually
increased back to the baseline expression level. Ang-1
immunoreactivity was found mainly in neuron-like and
glial-like cells in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Fig. 2C).
Quantiﬁcation analysis showed that changes in the
number of Ang-1-positive cells were consistent with the
results of Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D).

Vascular permeability after ischemia and reperfusion
Extravasation of EB was signiﬁcantly greater in rats that
underwent ischemic–reperfusion brain injury than in
sham-operated rats. Extravasated EB was detected
beginning at 3 h, peaked at 1 day, and remained
signiﬁcantly higher than baseline until 7 days after

reperfusion (p < 0.05; Fig. 2E). Extravasation gradually
decreased and returned to the control level at 14 days.
Expression of ZO-1 after ischemia and reperfusion
To examine the structural basis for the formation of
edema, we examined the expression of the tight junction
protein ZO-1. As shown in Fig. 3A, ZO-1 mRNA

decreased beginning at 6 h and reached a minimum at
1 day (p < 0.05). ZO-1 protein also gradually decreased
to a minimum 1 day after reperfusion (p < 0.05). It
persisted at a low level until 3 days and then increased
rapidly back to control levels (Fig. 3B). The results
demonstrate that the decrease in ZO-1 expression was
in accordance with the extent of vascular permeability.
Immunostaining showed that ZO-1 was expressed in

123

L. Zan et al. / Neuroscience 262 (2014) 118–128

vascular-like structures. (Fig. 3C), indicating that ZO-1 is
important in maintaining the vascular integrity.
Quantiﬁcation analysis conﬁrmed that changes in the
number of ZO-1-positive microvessels were in
accordance with the results of Western blotting (Fig. 3D).
Src correlates with angiogenic factors and ZO-1
Our results indicate that after reperfusion, Src may
modulate VEGF and angiopoietins, the levels of which
correlated with vascular permeability. VEGF and Ang-2
were upregulated, especially early after reperfusion,
whereas Ang-1 was downregulated. Src levels
correlated positively with levels of VEGF and Ang-2, but
negatively with those of Ang-1 and ZO-1; the decrease
in Ang-1 paralleled that of ZO-1 (Tables 1 and 2). The
results indicate that Src may play an important role in
vascular permeability by modulating angiogenic factors
and ZO-1.
PP1 reduces the expression of angiogenic factors
and ZO-1
To address the eﬀect of Src on angiogenic factors, we
treated rats with PP1 before surgery; DMSO and PP3
were used as controls. The mRNA and protein
expression levels of Src, VEGF, and Ang-2 were
signiﬁcantly increased, whereas Ang-1 was decreased
in DMSO- and PP3-treated groups compared with levels

reversed the expression levels of these proteins. The
results showed that Src mRNA and Src Y418
phosphorylation were signiﬁcantly decreased in the
PP1-treated group, compared with levels in the DMSOand PP3-treated groups (p < 0.05, Fig. 4A, B) at 1 day

protein levels also were decreased in the PP1-treated
group compared with levels in the DMSO- and PP3treated groups, whereas Ang-1 mRNA and protein were
increased in the PP1-treated group (p < 0.05, Fig. 4A,
B). ZO-1 mRNA and protein were also increased in the
PP1-treated group compared with levels in the DMSOand PP3-treated groups, although ZO-1 protein
remained lower than that in the sham-operated group

(p < 0.05, Fig. 4A, B). Consistent with the Western
blotting
results,
immunostaining
revealed
that
phosphorylated Src, VEGF, and Ang-2 were signiﬁcantly
decreased, while Ang-1 and ZO-1 were signiﬁcantly
increased in the PP1-treated group compared with the
respective levels in the DMSO- and PP3-treated groups
at 1 day after reperfusion (Fig. 4C, D).
PP1 reduces vascular permeability, cerebral edema,
and infarct volume
To further investigate the eﬀects of Src on cerebral
ischemic–reperfusion injury, we examined the eﬀects of
PP1 on vascular permeability, edema, and infarct

volume. Treatment with PP1 markedly decreased the
amount of EB extravasation in the ipsilateral cerebral
cortex (p < 0.05, Fig. 5A) and decreased brain water
content on day 1 after reperfusion (p < 0.05, Fig. 5B)
compared with levels in the DMSO- and PP3-treated
groups. Treatment with PP1 also decreased infarct
volume by more than 30% on day 1 after reperfusion
(p < 0.05, Fig. 5C, D).
Neurologic deﬁcit scores
As shown in Fig. 5E, PP1-treated rats exhibited
signiﬁcantly decreased neurologic deﬁcit scores
compared with scores of DMSO- and PP3-treated
groups (p < 0.05) at 1 day after reperfusion. No
diﬀerence in neurologic score was observed between
DMSO- and PP3-treated rats. The results indicate that
Src inhibition with PP1 improves functional outcome
after focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.

DISCUSSION
Ischemic–reperfusion injury causes blood–brain barrier
(BBB) disruption, which accelerates the development of
abnormal vascular permeability and exacerbates brain
edema (Cole et al., 1991; Yang and Betz, 1994).
Although the precise cellular mechanisms that underlie
changes in vascular permeability after cerebral ischemia
and reperfusion are unclear, several lines of evidence
from our laboratory and those of others indicate the

involvement of Src and angiogenic factors (Paul et al.,
2001; Zan et al., 2011). An alteration in vascular
permeability after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
may be important to the development of ischemic brain
damage, especially in brain edema formation (Albayrak
et al., 1997) Thus, elucidating the underlying
mechanisms and molecules that regulate vascular
permeability could lead to new therapies for the
treatment of stroke and other brain injuries that are
accompanied by brain edema. Here, we showed that
Src mRNA and Y418 phosphorylation increase
signiﬁcantly after ischemia and reperfusion, and that Src
signaling may regulate vascular permeability, possibly
by modulating angiogenic factors and tight junction
proteins. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence that
PP1, an Src antagonist, ameliorates vascular
permeability in rat brain after ischemia and reperfusion,
an eﬀect that may be mediated in part by direct
protection against BBB disruption.
Src kinase has been implicated in brain injury resulting
from permanent cerebral ischemia (Paul et al., 2001; Zan
et al., 2011) and intracerebral hemorrhage (Ardizzone
et al., 2007). Our results show for the ﬁrst time that,
compared with control levels, Src mRNA and Src Y418
phosphorylation are increased at 3 h after ischemic
reperfusion and persist at a high level until 12 h.
Moreover, Y418 phosphorylation demonstrates a
biphasic response, peaking at 6 h and 7 days. The
results indicate that the increase in Src Y418
phosphorylation is not solely due to the increase in Src

mRNA. Vascular permeability increased after ischemic
reperfusion, reaching a peak on day 1, before gradually
returning to control levels. The results suggest that
dynamic changes in Src kinase activity may contribute
to cerebral ischemic–reperfusion injury.
Based on previous reports that Src inhibition reduces
VEGF-induced vascular permeability and infarct volume
(Paul et al., 2001) and protects the brain against focal
ischemic injury (Lennmyr et al., 2004), we inferred that
Src might modulate not only VEGF but also other
angiogenic factors after ischemic–reperfusion injury.
Here we showed that VEGF and Ang-2 increased in
parallel with the increase in vascular permeability in the
early period after ischemic reperfusion. By increasing
endothelial permeability, VEGF enhances BBB
disruption and produces vasogenic edema, which is
particularly deleterious in ischemic–reperfusion injury.
Ang-2 has been shown to destabilize the vessel,
promote disassembly of cellular components (Folkman
and D’Amore, 1996; Asahara et al., 1998; Lauren et al.,
1998), and facilitate endothelial cell migration and
vascular sprouting. Ang-2 may act synergistically with
VEGF to promote vascular permeability after ischemic
reperfusion. Ang-1 is a strong anti-permeability factor
that can reduce vascular leakage. In this study, we
observed that Ang-1 mRNA and protein were decreased

signiﬁcantly at 12 h and 1 day, when vascular
permeability was at its greatest. This decrease in Ang-1
expression may explain the progression of vascular
permeability after focal cerebral ischemia and
reperfusion.
Reperfusion of the ischemic brain accelerates the
development of abnormal vascular permeability, leading
to brain edema formation and acceleration of brain
injury (Cole et al., 1991; Yang and Betz, 1994). The
increased vascular permeability is likely due, at least in
part, to a decrease in tight junction proteins such as
ZO-1, because the absence of ZO-1 increases vascular
permeability (Dvorak et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2001;
Fischer et al., 2002). In this study, we found that, like
Ang-1 expression, ZO-1 mRNA and protein were both
decreased after ischemic reperfusion. The decrease in
ZO-1 coincided with increases in EB extravasation,
suggesting that ZO-1 might play a critical role in
preserving BBB integrity.
Our analysis showed that Src correlated positively
with VEGF and Ang-2 but negatively with Ang-1 and
ZO-1. Ang-1 and ZO-1 did increase at later time points
after reperfusion, but they may be regulated by other
factors. We infer that Src may regulate vascular
permeability, possibly by modulating angiogenic factors
and tight junction proteins after ischemic reperfusion.

To address the role of Src in rat brain after ischemic
reperfusion, we evaluated the eﬀects of pharmacologic
inhibition of Src activity with PP1 (Hanke et al., 1996;
Liu et al., 1999). PP1 signiﬁcantly reduced vascular
permeability. This decrease was accompanied by an
increase in ZO-1. Src inhibition with PP1 also decreased
post-ischemic VEGF and Ang-2 expression and
increased Ang-1 expression compared with that in
control groups. Additionally, PP1 signiﬁcantly reduced
infarct volume, cerebral edema, and neurologic deﬁcits.
These results indicate that Src signaling may regulate
the expression of angiogenic factors and tight junction
proteins
after
ischemic
reperfusion,
thereby
exacerbating cerebral injury and neurologic dysfunction.
Therefore, inhibition of Src signaling could provide
neurovascular protection against cerebral ischemic–
reperfusion injury. However, it is possible that the
eﬃcacy of Src inhibition could have resulted from
diﬀerences in baseline ischemic severity induced by
PP1 pretreatment; therefore, the eﬀects of posttreatment with PP1 still must be examined. If postischemic Src inhibition is not eﬃcacious in the MCAO
model, its utility might be limited to planned ischemic
events, such as bypass surgery. PP1 would need to be
tested in a global ischemia model to determine its
eﬃcacy in such cases.
Taken together, our novel ﬁndings indicate that Src
signaling may promote vascular permeability after focal
cerebral ischemia and reperfusion, possibly by
modulating angiogenic factors, including VEGF, Ang-1,
and Ang-2, and the tight junction protein ZO-1. Inhibition
of Src signaling with PP1 reduced vascular permeability
and infarct size and improved neurologic outcome in
rats. Thus, Src signaling may provide a new therapeutic
target for reducing tissue damage caused by increased
vascular permeability.
