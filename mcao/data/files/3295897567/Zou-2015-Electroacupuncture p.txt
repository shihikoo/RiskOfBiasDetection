Abstract. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and
subsequent brain edema are major contributors to the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, however, current clinical therapeutic
methods remains unsatisfactory. Electroacupuncture (EA)
pretreatment has a protective effect against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). However, the underlying mechanisms
remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the effect of
EA pretreatment on BBB disruption was investigated in a focal
I/R rat model. Male Sprague‑Dawley rats (280-320 g) were
pretreated with EA at the acupoint ‘Baihui’ (GV20) 30 min/day,
for five days consecutively prior to focal cerebral I/R, which
was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
for 2 h. The results demonstrated that the infarction volume,
brain water content and neurological deficits increased in the
MCAO model rats at 3 h and 24 h post-reperfusion, and were
attenuated significantly by EA pretreatment. Furthermore,
electron microscopy examination confirmed a reduction in
brain edema reduction in the EA pretreated rats. Western blot
analysis revealed that the tight junction proteins between endothelial cells, including claudin‑5, occludin, were significantly
degraded, while the protein expression of phosphorylated (p‑)
caveolin‑1 and p‑Akt increased following reperfusion, all of
which were alleviated by EA pretreatment. However, no significant differences were observed in the expression of caveolin‑1
or Akt. Overall, the results demonstrated that EA pretreatment
significantly reduced BBB permeability and brain edema,
which were correlated with alleviation of the degradation
of tight junction proteins and inhibition of the expression of
p‑caveolin‑1 in the endothelial cells.

Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of mortality in industrialized
countries (1). Acute ischemic stroke, resulting from sudden
blood vessel occlusion by a thrombus or embolism, is the
most common form of stroke (1). Different mechanisms are
involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, and ischemic
injury and post‑ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), induced by thrombolytic therapy, always leads to disruption in the blood-brain
barrier (BBB), resulting in the development of brain edema
and subsequent damage (2). Thus, methods to protect the BBB
may assist in developing therapeutic strategies for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
The BBB is formed by endothelial cells, tight junctions
(TJs), pericytes, astrocytes and other extracellular matrix
components (3). BBB is essential for maintaining appropriate
neural function, and for protecting the central nervous system
from injury and disease, which tightly regulates the movement
of molecules, ions and cells between the blood and the central
nervous system (4,5).
TJs are important BBB structural components, which seal
the gaps between adjacent endothelial cells and thus maintain
paracellular permeability (6). Claudin and occludin are key
transmembrane proteins forming this seal (7). Alterations in
the distribution or loss of TJ proteins is frequently observed
in ischemic cerebral microvessels, resulting in compromised
BBB integrity (8,9).
Caveolae are small vesicular invaginations of the plasmamembrane, which have been implicated in endocytosis,
vesicular trafficking and signal transduction (10). The principal
structural proteins of caveolae are the caveolins, which consist
of three distinct proteins, caveolin‑1, ‑2 and ‑3. Caveolin‑1 is
particularly abundant in endothelial cells and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cerebral I/R injury (11). However,
the phosphorylation of caveolin‑1 at tyrosine14 is required
for the regulation of caveolae formation and function (12‑14).
Furthermore, it has been suggested that phosphorylation of
caveolin‑1 may be one of the factors associated with early
BBB breakdown and brain edema in brain injury (15).
In Asia, and particularly China, electroacupuncture (EA),
a novel therapy based on traditional acupuncture combined
with modern electrotherapy, is a general method used for the
treatment of cerebrovascular diseases (16). Several experimental and clinical studies have discussed the effect of EA

2028

on regulating different brain and heart diseases (17). There
is evidence that EA significantly promotes the recovery of
neurological function and, thus, improves patient quality of
life (18,19). However, the exact mechanisms underlying the
effects of EA pretreatment on BBB require elucidation.
Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate
the role of EA pretreatment in BBB disruption following I/R,
with a focus on caveolae and TJs. This was investigated using a
rat stroke model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),
and the effect of EA pretreatment on BBB permeability and
on the expression levels of caveolin‑1, phosphorylated (p‑)
caveolin‑1, claudin‑5 and occludin were determined.
Materials and methods
Animals. The experimental procedure used in the present
study was approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal
Experimentation of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine
(Nanjing, China) and all procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for
Animal Research (20). Male Sprague‑Dawley rats weighing
between 280 and 300 g were provided by the Experimental
Animal Center of Nanjing Medical University. The rats were
housed in cages under controlled conditions, with a 12 h light/
dark cycle, temperature at 22±2˚C and humidity at 60-70% for
at least one week prior to surgery, and received food and water
ad libitum. The rats were fasted 12 h prior to surgery, but were
allowed free access to water. A total of 140 rats were randomly
divided into five groups: Sham group (S); 3 h post-I/R group
(I/R3 h), 24 h post-I/R group (I/R24 h); EA pretreated
3 h post-I/R group (EA+I/R3 h); and EA pretreated 24 h postI/R group (EA+I/R24 h). Each group contained 28 rats All
the rats were assessed between the point of ischemia and 24 h
post-reperfusion.
MCAO model. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced
by MCAO. Anesthetization was induced using pentobarbital
sodium (40 mg/kg body weight; Sigma‑Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) intraperitoneally. The right common carotid artery
and the right external carotid artery were exposed through a
ventral midline neck incision, and were ligated proximally
and temporarily. A 2.0 monofilament nylon suture (Doccol
Corporation, Redlands, CA, USA), with its tip rounded
through heating in a flame, was inserted into the common
carotid artery through an arteriectomy, just beneath the carotid
bifurcation, and was advanced into the internal carotid artery
~18-20 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation, until mild resistance indicated occlusion of the origin of the anterior cerebral
artery and the MCA Following 2 h of ischemia, reperfusion
was accomplished by withdrawing the suture. The incision
was closed and the animals were allowed to recover from the
surgery. In the sham group, the same surgery was performed,
but without occlusion of the MCA. The rectal temperature
was maintained at 38±0.5˚C throughout the procedure using a
thermostat‑controlled heating pad (Doccol Corporation).
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) of the MCA was measured
using laser Doppler flowmetry. A flexible fiber‑optic probe was
affixed to the skull over the cortex supplied by the proximal
part of the MCA (2 mm caudal to the bregma and 6 mm lateral
to the middle). Rats exhibiting <80% reduction in CBF in the

core of the MCA area were excluded from further investigation. Besides the sham group (S), the other four groups all had
rats excluded (I/R3 h, n=3; I/R24 h, n=2; EA+I/R3 h, n=2;
EA+I/R24 h, n=2).
EA pretreatment. According to the Experimental Animals
Meridians Mapping, Baihui (GV20), which is located at the
vertex of the parietal bone, that is, the midpoint of the connecting
line between the auricular apices, was selected (18,19). The rats
in EA pretreatment groups were anesthetized and stimulated
using a 1 mA current, with a density‑sparse wave of 2/15 Hz,
for 30 min/day for five consecutive days. This was performed
using a Hwato Electronic Acupuncture Treatment instrument
(SDZ‑V; Suzhou Medical Applicances Co., Ltd., Suzhou,
China).
Neurobehavioral evaluation. A modified neurologic deficit
score, described by Longa et al (21) was used for neurological
assessment and was scored as follows: 0, no deficit; 1, failure
to extend left forepaw fully; 2, circling to the left; 3, falling to
the left; 4, no spontaneous walking with a depressed level of
consciousness. Rats scoring between 2 and 3 were included in
the subsequent experiments.
Brain water content. Following neurobehavioral evaluation, the rats (n=5) were sacrificed and decapitated after an
intraperitoneal injection of 40 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium,
followed by removal of the brains. The brains were rapidly
separated into left and right cerebral hemispheres, and the
right cerebral hemispheres were weighed (wet weight) using
an electronic balance (Ohaus Corporation, Parisippany, NY,
USA). Subsequently, the brains were dried for 24 h at 100˚C
in order to obtain the dry weight. The brain water content was
calculated as follows: Brain water content = [(wet weight ‑ dry
weight) / wet weight] x 100. This was used as an index for
brain edema (22).
Infarct volume assessment. Following decapitation, the brains
(n=8) were removed and frozen at ‑20˚C for 15 min. The brains
were were then sliced using a plastic matrix (2 mm thickness;
Sigma‑Aldrich) and stained using 2% 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma‑Aldrich) in 0.1 mol/l phosphate
buffer (Sigma‑Aldrich) for 30  min at 37˚C to evaluate the
infarct volume (23). The infarcted tissue remained unstained
(white), whereas normal tissues was stained red. The infarct
volume was calculated as follows: Infarct volume = contralateral hemisphere volume ‑ non‑infarcted volume of the
ipsilateral hemisphere) / contralateral hemisphere volume (24).
Ultrastructure examination. The rats (n=5) were anesthetized with 40 mg/kg intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium,
then were perfused with pre‑cooled phosphate‑buffered
saline (PBS; pH 7.4), followed by PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma‑Aldrich) and 0.25% glutaraldehyde
(Sigma‑Aldrich). The brain was sectioned into three slices,
starting 3 mm from the anterior tip of the frontal lobe in the
coronal plane. The slices were 3, 4, and 3 mm thick from front
to back, respectively. The middle slice was cut longitudinally
in the ischemic hemisphere 2 mm from the midline then a
transverse diagonal cut was made at the 2 o'clock position to

MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS 12: 2027-2034, 2015

separate the core from the penumbra. A 1 mm thick coronal
slice from the cortex penumbra area was removed. The slice
was placed in fresh prepared 2.5% glutaraldehyde overnight
at 4˚C. Following rinsing with 0.1 mol/l PBS three times,
the slice was post‑fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 1 h, dehydrated
in graded ethanol (Sigma‑Aldrich), and embedded in epoxy
resin (Sigma‑Aldrich). Polymerization was performed at 80˚C
for 24 h. Blocks were cut from the slice using a Reichert/Leica
Ultracut S Ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems GmbH,
Wetzlar, Germany) into ultrathin sections (60‑70 nm), which
were then post‑stained with uranyl acetate (Sigma‑Aldrich)
and lead citrate (Sigma‑Aldrich), and examined using a Hitachi
7100 electron microscope (Nikon, Corporation, Toyko, Japan).
Western blot analysis. To analyze the expression of proteins,
the rats (n=5) were decapitated and brains were removed.
The ischemic cortices, and corresponding cortices of the
sham rats, were rapidly dissected and frozen on dry ice
(Sigma‑Aldrich). Total protein samples were extracted using
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA; Sigma‑Aldrich)
buffer for determination of the expression of claudin‑5,
occludin, caveolin‑1 and Akt. To determine the expression
of p‑caveolin‑1 and p‑Akt, protease inhibitor cocktail tablets
(Sigma‑Aldrich) were added, at a ratio of 1 tablet/10 ml RIPA
buffer. The protein concentrations were determined using
a spectrophotometer (UV‑2540; Shimadzu Corporation,
Kyoto, Japan). Equivalent quantities of proteins (70 µg)
from each sample were separated using 10% SDS‑PAGE
(Sigma‑Aldrich) and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma‑Aldrich). The membranes were
then incubated overnight at 4˚C with the following rabbit
primary antibodies: Claudin‑5 (1:1,000; cat.no. ab53765;
Abcam), occludin (1:1,000; cat.no. ab31721, Abcam), caveolin‑1 (1:1,000; cat. no. 3238; Cell signaling Technology, Inc.,
Danvers, MA, USA), Akt (1:1,000; cat. no. 9272; Cell signaling
Technology, Inc.), p‑caveolin‑1 (1:1,000; cat. no. 3251; Cell
signaling Technology, Inc.) and p‑Akt (1:1,000; cat. no. 9275;
Cell signaling Technology, Inc.), followed by incubation with
the respective horseradish peroxidase‑conjugated anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies (1:5,000; Jackson Immunoresearch
Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) for 60 min at
room temperature. Immunoreactivity was detected using
an enhanced chemiluminescent autoradiography system
(sc‑2048 Western Blotting Luminol Reagent; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.). Each blot was reprobed with β ‑actin
(1:5,000; cat. no. sc‑130657; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.), following stripping by heat and detergent to remove
the antibodies from the membrane, to provide a control for
the load variations between the samples. Autoradiographic
films (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were used for the final
determination of protein expression using SigmaScan 5.0
(Sigma-Aldrich) and normalized to the relative optical
density obtained for β‑actin.
Statistical analysis. SPSS 19.0 for Windows (IBM SPSS,
Armonk, NY, USA) was used to performed statistical analysis.
All values are expressed as the mean ±standard deviation. Data
were analyzed using one‑way analysis of variance, and intergroup differences were detected using Student‑Newman‑Keuls

post‑hoc analysis. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
EA pretreatment reduces infarction volume and neurological
deficits. A modified neurologic deficit score, described by
Longa et al (21), was used for neurological assessment of the
different groups. The rats in the I/R3 h group exhibited severe
neurological deficits compared with the sham group. Following
24 h reperfusion without any pretreatment, the neurological
deficits remained unchanged, while EA pretreatment significantly improved the neurological deficits induced by I/R.
TTC staining was used to reveal cerebral infarcts, with
normal brain tissues stained red, and infarct lesions remaining
unstained (white). Compared with the sham group, the brain
infarct volume increased significantly in the I/R3 h and I/
R24 h groups. In the EA+I/R groups, these I/R‑induced cerebral infarcts were reduced significantly and dose-dependently
(Fig. 1).
EA pretreatment improves brain water content. The brain
water content was significantly increased in the I/R groups,
compared with the sham group. In addition, EA pretreatment
significantly reduced the brain water content, compared with
the I/R3 h and I/R24 h groups. (P<0.05; Fig. 2).
Taken together, these findings demonstrated that EA
pretreatment attenuated the I/R‑induced increase in BBB
permeability.
EA pretreatment ameliorates cerebral microvasculature. In
order to determine the mechanisms underlying the role of EA
pretreatment in maintaining BBB permeability, transmission
electron microscopy was used to identify the morphological
changes of cerebral microvasculature in the cortex in all the
groups. In the sham group, the cerebral microvasculature
was relatively normal, with normal caveolae, and the TJs
localized between endothelial cells as continuous lines. By
contrast, in the I/R groups, the caveolae in the endothelial cells
were increased, and the continuous lines of the TJs became
ill‑defined, appearing as dotted lines, indicating degradation
of the TJ proteins. However, these observations were improved
by EA pretreatment. These results were also confirmed using
western blotting (Fig. 3).
EA pretreatment alleviates the degradation of TJ proteins.
Western blotting was used to evaluate the expression levels
of claudin‑5 and occludin. Compared with the sham group,
I/R induced a significant decrease in claudin‑5 and occludin.
Following EA pretreatment, the expression of these two TJ
proteins increased significantly. No significant differences
were observed between the EA+I/R3 h group and the EA+I/
R24 h group (Fig. 4).
EA pretreatment alleviates the increase of p‑caveolin‑1.
Western blotting was used to evaluate the expression of
caveolin‑1 and p‑caveolin‑1. In terms of caveolin‑1, no
significant differences were identified among the treatment
groups. However, the expression of p‑caveolin‑1 was significantly increased following I/R compared with that of the sham

Similar to caveolin‑1, no significant differences were observed
among the groups for Akt. However, the expression of p‑Akt
was significantly increased following I/R compared with
that of the sham group, while EA pretreatment significantly

group, while EA pretreatment significantly relieved this effect
(Fig. 5).
EA pretreatment alleviates the increase of p‑Akt. Western
blotting was used to evaluate the expression of Akt and p‑Akt.

In the present study, the effects and possible mechanisms of
EA pretreatment on BBB permeability following focal cerebral
I/R were investigated. Initially, EA pretreatment was observed
to effectively reduce cerebral infarct volume and improved the
neurobehavioral scores, alleviating the ischemic damage. EA
pretreatment also ameliorated brain water content and cerebral
microvasculature, and reduced the degradation of TJ proteins,
including claudin‑5 and occludin. Furthermore, EA pretreatment reduced the increased expression of p‑caveolin‑1 and
p‑Akt in the endothelial cells.
In countries, including China, EA at Baihui (GV 20)
(25‑27), an acupoint of the DU series, has been commonly
used for treating cerebrovascular diseases. A number of
studies have demonstrated the protective effects of EA
pretreatment in cerebral ischemia (18). The present study and
previous studies have reported that EA pretreatment reduced
the cerebral infarct volume and improved neurobehavioral
scores following transient MCAO. However, the effects of EA
pretreatment on BBB disruption associated with cerebral I/R
remain to be fully elucidated.
Ischemic stroke and subsequent reperfusion cause severe
clinical complications, including brain edema (28). In the
present study, following 3 h of reperfusion and 2 h subsequent
ischemia, marked brain edema was observed on examination
of brain water content, which was maintained until 24 h of
reperfusion. In addition, EA pretreatment significantly alleviated brain edema, indicating EA pretreatment as a therapeutic
strategy for ischemia.
It is well-known that the BBB is a highly specialized structure between the blood circulation and the CNS, maintaining
the appropriate environment for appropriate neural function
and protecting the CNS from injury and disease (29). Following
a period of ischemia, the BBB is broken down, resulting in

vasogenic brain edema. It is suggested that two pathways are
involved in endothelial cells, which affect BBB permeability:
Tight junctions, which mediate paraendothelial transport,
and caveolae, which mediate transcellular traffic (30,31).
The present study demonstrated, using western blotting and
electron microscopy, that these two pathways may be involved
in I/R induced BBB interruption, and was alleviated by EA
pretreatment.
During BBB breakdown associated with cerebral I/R,
TJ protein degradation is a critical step. Occludin, the first

integral transmembrane protein, may act as a primary
shock‑absorber, mediating TJ responses to acute vascular
dynamics changes (32). Claudin‑5, a TJ protein with four
transmembrane domains, is particularly important in regulating paracellular permeability for small solutes across the
BBB (33). In the present study, western blotting demonstrated
that the protein expression levels of occludin and claudin‑5
decreased following cerebral I/R, and were partly relieved by
EA pretreatment. In addition, electron microscopy revealed
that the appearance of TJs were ill-defined following cerebral

I/R, and this was relieved by EA pretreatment. Therefore, the
protective action of EA pretreatment on BBB permeability is
possibly associated with paraendothelial transport.
Caveolin‑1 is known to be important in vesicular trafficking by transcytosis, endocytosis and potocytosis (10).
Previous studies have demonstrated that early BBB breakdown
may be associated with increased or decreased expression
of caveolin‑1, using several experimental models (34‑37). In
the present study, the association between EA pretreatment
and caveolin‑1 was examined. Therefore, the effects of EA
pretreatment on the expression of caveolin‑1 following cerebral I/R were investigated. However, no significant differences
in caveolin-1 were observed among the groups.
The phosphorylation of caveolin‑1 at tyrosine14 is required
to regulate caveolae formation and function (12,15), and the
present study demonstrated that the expression of p‑caveolin‑1
was significantly increased following I/R compared with
that in the sham group, while EA pretreatment significantly
relieved this effect. These results suggested that p‑caveolin‑1
signaling increased the density of caveolae and caused transcytosis of proteins, leading to BBB breakdown and brain
edema following cerebral I/R. These effects were reversed by
EA pretreatment.
In the endothelium, caveolin‑1 regulates nitric oxide
signaling by binding to and inhibiting endothelial nitric oxide
synthase (eNOS). Activation of the Akt kinase leads to eNOS
activation and its dissociation from caveolin‑1 (10). Therefore,
the expression of Akt and p‑Akt were also investigated in
the present study. Similar to caveolin‑1, no significant differences were observed among the groups for Akt. However, the
expression of p‑Akt was significantly increased following I/R
compared with that of the sham rats, while EA pretreatment
significantly relieved this effect. It was hypothesized that the
increased expression of p‑Akt may be due to the phosphorylation of caveolin‑1, leading to the downstream activation of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt. There may be a correlation between p‑caveolin‑1 and p‑Akt.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that EA
pretreatment was capable of protecting against I/R‑induced
BBB disruption in rats, partly by interference in the degradation of TJ protein and caveolin‑1‑mediated signal transmission
in vascular endothelial cells. These findings suggested that
EA pretreatment may provide novel strategies for the clinical
treatment of I/R injury, as an alternative approach to alleviate
severe brain edema. This requires further investigation.
