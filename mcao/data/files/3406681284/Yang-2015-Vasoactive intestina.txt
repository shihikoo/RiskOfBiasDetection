in the SVZ were also enhanced in VIP-treated rats at 7 days after stroke. VIP treatment
obviously increased the number of BrdU positive endothelial cells in the SVZ and density of
cerebral microvessels in the ischemic boundary at 28 days after ischemia. Our study
suggests that in the ischemic rat brain VIP reduces brain damage and promotes
neurogenesis by increasing VEGF. VIP-enhanced neurogenesis is associated with angiogenesis. These changes may contribute to improvement in functional outcome.

Introduction

Cerebral ischemia results in a rapid onset of neurological
injury due to occlusion of blood supply to the brain. The
repair of infarct damage and the improvement of functional
recovery are considered important strategic approaches for
the treatment of stroke. Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs)
exist in two germinal centers in the adult brain: the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular
zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (Gage, 2000).
Cerebral ischemia induces NSPC proliferation in the SVZ and
SGZ (Ohab et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2005). Newly generated
NSPCs can migrate into ischemic regions, where they may
differentiate into mature neuron and participate in recovery
from neurological deﬁcit (Yamashita et al., 2006; Zhang et al.,
2005). Substantial studies have documented that several
growth and trophic factors can modulate ischemia-induced
neurogenesis (Dibajnia and Morshead, 2013). Vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of these factors that
induces angiogenesis and is implicated in the process of
neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia (Li et al., 2011; Sun
et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2007). Studies of recent years have
revealed that many endogenous neuropeptides play a regulatory role in neurogenesis (Zaben and Gray, 2013).
Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a member of the
pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP),
secretin, and glucagon peptide family. In the nervous system,
VIP is expressed by neurons where this neuropeptide,
through speciﬁc membrane receptors: VPAC receptors (VPAC1
and VPAC2) showing similar afﬁnities for VIP and PACAP, and
PAC1 receptor having higher afﬁnity for PACAP than VIP,
exert pleiotropic effects including those on immunomodulation, muscle relaxation, cell proliferation and differentiation
(Brenneman, 2007; Moody et al., 2003). Several studies have
documented a robust neuroprotection of VIP in a variety of
brain injury models (Brenneman, 2007; Moody et al., 2003;
Yang et al., 2011) and a proangiogenic role in ischemic insult
in vitro and in vivo (Yang et al., 2009, 2013). In addition, VIP is
also a known modulator of developmental neurogenesis
affecting the development of the neural tube (DiCiccoBloom, 1996). In vitro, the neuropeptide has been found to
regulate proliferation and differentiation of embryonic and
neural stem cells (Mercer et al., 2004; Chafai et al., 2011;
Jaworski and Proctor, 2000), to inhibit death of hippocampal
stem cells (Antonawich and Said, 2002) and to favor survival
of sympathetic neuroblasts (Pincus et al., 1994). These data
suggest that VIP might be implicated in neurogenesis. However, there is no report regarding the possible effect of VIP on
neurogenesis following cerebral ischemia.
Neural stem/progenitor cells within the adult brain germinal centers reside in a neurovascular niche (Li et al., 2011;
Ohab et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007), a microenvironment in
which neurogenesis occurs concomitant with angiogenic
response to stroke, and is correlated with improvements in
behavioral deﬁcits and cognitive function (Thored et al. 2006).
In the recent study, we documented that exogenously added
VIP promotes angiogenesis by increasing VEGF expression
and secretion (Yang et al., 2009, 2013), and decreases cerebral

infarct size by inhibiting apoptosis and S100B expression
(Yang et al., 2011) in ischemic region after MCAO in rat. The
present study was to investigate the effects of VIP treatment
on neurogenesis and neurological function during cerebral
ischemia. Furthermore, the potential role of VIP on interaction between post-ischemic neurogenesis and angiogenesis
was also examined.

Results

2.1.

VIP improves neurological outcome

Neurologic deﬁcits were measured at predetermined time
points after MCAO with the neurological severity score
(Fig. 1). Similar neurological impairments were detected at
2 h after onset of ischemia in all animals. A more pronounced
decrease in the neurological severity score was observed at
7 days after MCAO in VIP-treated animals, compared with
those of the control group. The difference continued to
increase with time until the end of the study (28 days after
MCAO), indicating that VIP was effective to improve neurological function after cerebral ischemia.

2.2.

VIP reduces the infarct volumes

Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the infarct was
located mainly in the lateral striatum and the surrounding
cortical areas (Fig. 2A). Treatment with VIP signiﬁcantly
(Po0.05) reduced the infarct volumes at 7, 14 and 28 days
after MCAO, compared to control rats (Fig. 2B), implying a
neuroprotective effect for exogenous VIP.

ischemia, and sacriﬁced at intervals thereafter (Fig. 3). The
ischemia-induced BrdU-immunoreactive cells were mainly
located in the dorsolateral ventricle walls of SVZ (Fig. 4A and
B). Administration of VIP signiﬁcantly (Po0.05) increased the
numbers of BrdU-immunoreactive cells in the ipsilateral SVZ
at 7 days (by 1.4-fold), 14 days (by 1.4-fold) and 28 days (by
1.5-fold) of MCAO compared with the number in control rats
(Fig. 4C). VIP treatment thus increased SVZ cell proliferation
in rats after MCAO. In addition, DCX-immunoreactive area in
the ipsilateral SVZ was signiﬁcantly (Po0.05) increased by
34% at 7 days, 37% at 14 days, 40% at 28 days after MCAO in
VIP-treated rats (Fig. 4E and H) compared with that of the
control rats (Fig. 4D and H). DCX-immunoreactive cells were
observed in the vicinity of blood vessels in the ischemic
boundary regions of striatum at 28 days of MCAO (Fig. 4F and
G), increased labeling in the VIP-treated rats (Fig. 4G) was
more obvious than in the control rats (Fig. 4F), indicating that
VIP treatment promoted neuroblast proliferation in the SVZ
and neuroblast migration in the direction of the ischemic
region.

2.4.
VIP increases the expression of VEGF in the ischemic
hemispheres
In light of the major role of VEGF on neurogenesis and
angiogenesis, Western blotting analysis and immunohistochemistry were applied to examine the expression of VEGF in
the ischemic brain at 7 days after MCAO. Western blotting
analysis showed that VEGF protein was expressed in the
ipsilateral hemisphere (Fig. 5A). VEGF expression was
increased by approximate 1.7-fold in response to treatment
with VIP as compared to that in the control rats (Fig. 5B).
Consistent with the Western blotting analysis, immunostaining for VEGF revealed a number of VEGF-positive cells in the
ipsilateral SVZ (Fig. 5C–F), and some VEGF-positive cells were
localized in vessels (Fig. 5E and F, arrows). Rats treated with
VIP displayed a signiﬁcant (Po0.05) increase in the number of
VEGF-positive cells (46%) compared to that in the control rats
(Fig. 5G).

and angiogenesis in the rat brains. (A) Experimental
protocol. Rats underwent 2 h MCAO and were administered
with intraventricular VIP after onset of reperfusion. BrdU
injection (by the intraperitoneal route) was on 1–6 days, and
rats were killed at 7, 14, and 28 days and brains sectioned
for histopathologic examinations. (B) Diagram of the brain

angiogenesis, the dorsolateral region of SVZ (a box) and ﬁve
ﬁelds of view of the peri-infarct area in the striatum (round

shown in gray.

To determine whether angiogenesis occurs in the SVZ after
MCAO, we ﬁrst looked for evidence of endothelial cell division
by giving repeated injections of BrdU before sacriﬁce. At 28
days after MCAO, BrdU-positive nuclei on endothelial cells
localized in enlarged cerebral vessels were clearly observed in
the SVZ of the ischemic hemisphere (Fig. 6A and B). VIPtreated rats exhibited a signiﬁcantly (Po0.05) increased fraction of BrdU positive endothelial cells that were about
1.7 times higher (Fig. 6B and C), compared with that of the
control rats (Fig. 6A and C), indicating that VIP treatment
enhances angiogenesis in the SVZ, which may be associated
with neurogenesis.
To further examine the proangiogenic role of VIP, 28 days
after MCAO, vascular density was quantitatively evaluated
around the ischemic lesion in striatum by immunohistochemical localization of CD34 in the ipsilateral hemisphere

192

(Fig. 6D and E). Treatment with VIP signiﬁcantly (Po0.05)
increased the vessel density by 37% (Fig. 6E and F) as
compared with their respective control rats (Fig. 6D and F).

Discussion

In the present study, our data show that treatment with VIP
to rats beginning 2 h after MCAO reduces infarct size and
improves functional recovery. In addition, VIP increases cell
proliferation in the SVZ and migration of cells toward the
lesioned area via increasing VEGF. As expected, VIP also
boosts angiogenesis as shown by the increase in the number
of proliferated endothelial cell in the SVZ and vessels density
in proximity to the ischemic lesion, which is associated with
VIP-enhanced neurogenesis.
Previously, numerous evidences have accumulated on
neurotrophy and neuroprotection of VIP. In vitro, VIP is
shown to promote cell survival and differentiation (Moody
et al., 2003), to neuroprotection against viral and excitotoxic
inﬂuences (Brenneman, 2007). We recently discovered that
treatment with VIP reduces rat brain infarction at 12 and 24 h
after transient focal brain ischemia. In the present study, the
signiﬁcantly decreased lesion volume observed at 7–28 days
after MCAO further attests to the early neuroprotective
effects of VIP. Treatment of stroke with several therapeutic
agents has been shown to improve neurological function
with reducing infarction volume (Gibson et al., 2005; Sun
et al., 2003), suggesting that neuroprotection determines
outcome. Our ﬁndings show that rats received VIP treatment
display more remarkable amelioration in neurological function from 7 to 28 days after MCAO. The continuous improvement is accompanied by the reduction of the infarct volume.
Based on the present results, it seems likely that the effect of
VIP on improving functional outcome is due to its neuroprotection after stroke.
Although neuropeptides have been shown to stimulate
neurogenesis in the adult brain (Mercer et al., 2004; Zaben
and Gray, 2013), the role of VIP in this process following
cerebral ischemia is poorly known. VIP may play an important role in the central nervous system development. Studies
have documented a proliferative and differentiative activity
of VIP on neural precursor cells during mice embryonic
development (Chafai et al., 2011; DiCicco-Bloom, 1996), and
a neuroprotective effect on sympathetic neuroblasts and
hippocampal stem cells (Antonawich and Said, 2002; Pincus
et al., 1994). VIP and PACAP are structurally related neuroFig. 4 – Effects of VIP on neurogenesis after MCAO. (A and B)

peptides. The data from in vitro proliferation have indicated
that PACAP can stimulate adult neural stem cell proliferation.
Interestingly, a proliferative effect of VIP at nanomolar concentrations is not observed. Only micromolar concentrations
of VIP could stimulate proliferation of mouse embryonic and

193

neural stem cells (Jaworski and Proctor, 2000; Mercer et al.,
2004). Neurogenesis occurs in the SVZ and SGZ after stroke
(Ohab et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2005). The majority of cells in
the adult SVZ are migrating neuroblasts that continue to
proliferating (García-Verdugo et al., 1998). The treatment of
VIP after MCAO signiﬁcantly increases the numbers of BrdUlabeled cells and DCX-immunoreactive area in the ipsilateral
SVZ, suggesting that VIP treatment enhances post-stroke
neurogenesis in the SVZ. Moreover, we notice an accumulation of DCX immunoreaction in the peri-infarction region of
striatum in treated animals, indicating that VIP also promotes migration of neuroblasts toward the ischemic region.
These results imply that VIP-enhanced neurogenesis may
contribute to repair ischemic injury (Xiong et al., 2010;
Yamashita et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2005).
VIP-promoted neurogenesis has been observed in the
present study, but the mechanisms by which VIP exerts its
effects remain unknown. In the nervous system, the pleiotropic effects of VIP exerted through its receptors are associated with a cAMP/PKA dependent pathway, calcium
mobilization, protein kinase C, phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3-K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase MEK1/2
(Brenneman, 2007; Collado et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2013).
During embryonic development, PAC1 and VPAC1 receptors
mRNAs are expressed in all germinative areas of the brain,
suggesting that PAC1 and VPAC1 receptors mediate the
neurotrophic actions of the peptide (Basille et al., 2000). In
the adult rat brain, VPAC1 receptor mRNA has been found to
predominate in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus
(Moody et al., 2003). It has been reported that PAC1 receptor
mRNA is expressed in the subventricular zone and the
hippocampus dentate gyrus of the adult rat and mouse. High
concentrations of VIP could activate PAC1 receptor and
stimulate proliferation of cultured mouse neural stem cells
(Jaworski and Proctor, 2000; Mercer et al., 2004). These data
suggest that VPAC1 and/or PAC1 receptors may be involved in
the proliferating effects of VIP on NSPCs. However, the
hypothesis that the proneurogenic action of VIP after MCAO
was correlated to action of VIP receptors leading to change in
those pathways described above remains to be deﬁned. The
present results suggest that this action of VIP appears to
involve VEGF. Neural stem cells from the SVZ and the SGZ in
adult rats express VEGF and its receptors. Over-expression of
VEGF has been shown to enhance neurogenesis in the SVZ of
the adult rat after a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion

(Wang et al., 2007). The absence of VEGF or selective inhibition of VEGF receptor attenuates post-ischemic NSPC proliferation and migration (Li et al., 2011). Our data indicate that
treatment with VIP increases the expression of VEGF in the
SVZ and elevates the brain levels of VEGF protein, which then
results in an enhanced neurogenesis. In other word, the
increased VEGF likely mediates the proneurogenic action of
VIP in the ischemic brain.
As a proangiogenic factor, VIP promotion of angiogenesis
has been reported in the xenograft (Collado et al., 2007) and
rat sponge (Hu et al., 1996) models. Recently, our studies have
documented that VIP treatment, by enhanced VEGF, promotes angiogenesis in the penumbra areas in the adult focal
cerebral ischemia rats (Yang et al., 2009) and proliferation of
endothelial cells in cultured cerebral microvessel endothelial
cells (Yang et al., 2013). Angiogenesis has been observed in
the SVZ after distal brain injury (Gotts and Chesselet, 2005),
but the effect of VIP has not been examined in the brain's
neuroproliferative zones. In the present study, we ﬁnd that
treatment with VIP signiﬁcantly increases BrdU-positive
endothelial cells localized in enlarged cerebral vessels in
the SVZ, indicating a role of VIP on the promotion of
ischemia-induced angiogenesis in the SVZ. Furthermore,
VIP treatment also signiﬁcantly enhances vascular density
of the ischemic boundary regions and VEGF expression of rat
brain, which are consistent with results of our previous
studies (Yang et al., 2009, 2013). Newly formed vessels can
improve tissue perfusion around the ischemic boundary
zone, thereby promoting the recovery of neurologic function
following ischemia (Xiong et al., 2010). Therefore, VIPenhanced angiogenesis mediated by VEGF in the ischemic
rat brain may contribute to functional recovery.
Post-ischemic angiogenesis has been documented to be
closely tied to neurogenesis (Ohab et al., 2006; Yamashita
et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2005). Blood vessels stimulate NSPCs
by the endothelial secretion of various growth and neurotrophic factors, and can also provide a scaffold on which
NSPCs and neuroblasts can migrate (Ohab et al., 2006; Kojima
et al., 2010). We show that treatment with VIP enhances
angiogenesis within the SVZ where neurogenesis occurs and
VEGF expresses in endothelial cells, and within the periinfarction region of striatum where the migrating neuroblasts
appear in the vicinity of blood vessels. Cerebral endothelial
cells express VIP receptors, the administration of VIP acts
directly on cerebral endothelial cells that secrete VEGF (Yang
et al., 2013), which promotes NSPC proliferation and differentiation and migration of neuroblasts along blood vessels
into the ischemic boundary regions (Kojima et al., 2010; Li
et al., 2011; Ohab et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2003; Wang et al.,
2007). These results indicate that ischemia-induced neurogenesis may be associated with angiogenesis after treatment
with VIP.
In conclusion, the results of our study show that the
administration of VIP after MCAO exerts a neuroprotective
effect that reduces infarct volume and leads to neurogenesis
and angiogenesis that are mediated through increasing VEGF.
These effects result in better functional outcome. Our ﬁndings may have important implications for the therapeutic
application of VIP to promote reparation after cerebral
ischemia.

Experimental procedures

4.1.

Animals

Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 240–280 g (Animal
Breeding Center, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China) were
used in this study. Animals were allowed to acclimate for at
least 7 days prior to the experiment and were allowed free
access to water and food before surgery. The experimental
protocol was conducted in accordance with the regulations of
Xi'an Jiaotong University for the use of experimental animals
in research, and in conformity with the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. Every effort was made to minimize animal suffering
and to reduce the number of animals used.

4.2.

Transient focal cerebral ischemia

Transient focal cerebral ischemia was achieved by right-sided
MCAO (Yang et al., 2009, 2011). Brieﬂy, the rats were maintained under anesthesia with chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg).
The right carotid artery was carefully exposed through a
midline cervical incision in the neck. The origin of the middle
cerebral artery was then occluded by introducing a 3–0
monoﬁlament nylon suture with a rounded tip from the
basal part of the external carotid artery into the internal
carotid artery. The suture was gently advanced 17–18 mm
past the common carotid artery bifurcation. After a 2 h
occlusion, the suture was gently withdrawn to restore blood
ﬂow as the reperfusion and the wound was sutured (under
the same anesthetic conditions as surgery). Body temperatures (rectal) were maintained at 3770.5 1C using a heating
lamp and a heating pad during surgery.

4.3.

Drug treatment

After onset of reperfusion, intracerebroventricular injection
of VIP was preformed as described by Yang (Yang et al., 2009,
2011). The rats were immobilized in a stereotaxic instrument,
a microsyringe was placed in the right lateral ventricle
(0.8 mm posterior, 1.4 mm lateral to the bregma and 3.5 mm
deep as measured from the dural surface). 2 μg VIP (sigma)
dissolved in 10 μL physiological saline was slowly injected
into the right lateral ventricle. Ischemic rats treated with the
same volume of vehicle (0.9% saline) were used as a control
group. Animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia and
housed individually with free access to food and water.

4.4.

5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injection schedule

BrdU (Sigma) was used for mitotic labeling to evaluate the
progenitor cell proliferation. BrdU (50 mg/kg in saline) was
injected intraperitoneally daily for 6 consecutive days into
VIP treated rats (n ¼12) and control rats (n¼ 12) starting at 24 h
after MCAO. Four each were killed at 7, 14 and 28 days after
MCAO.

4.5.

Neurological functional assessment

To evaluate post-ischemic motor and behavioral deﬁcits, a
modiﬁed behavioral rating scale (neurological severity score)
was assessed as reported earlier (Bederson et al., 1986), at 2 h,
7, 14 and 28 days after MCAO by an investigator who was
blinded to the experimental groups. Neurological function
was graded on a scale of 0–5. Rats were held gently by the tail,
suspended 30 cm above the ﬂoor. The normal response with
extension of both forelimbs toward the ﬂoor was scored 0.
Rats with consistent left forelimb ﬂexion and/or thorax
twisting were placed on a sheet of soft plastic-backed paper
that could be gripped by its claws. Lateral pressure would be
applied from behind the shoulders to slid the forelimbs
gently to the left and then to the right. Resistance to sliding
in both directions was scored 1 and a decreased resistance to
the lateral push from the right side was scored 2. Rats
walking and/or circling toward the contralateral (left) side
were scored 3. Rats with constant circling or other gait
disturbance (left-sided tumbling) were scored 4 and without
any spontaneous moving were scored 5. Only animals that
showed gait disturbances with circling or walking to the left
(given scored 3–4) at 2 h after MCAO were included in the
subsequent analysis.

4.6.

Specimen preparation

For histologic analyses, at 7, 14 or 28 days after MCAO,
animals (n¼ 4 for each BrdU-injected group) were re-anesthetized and perfused through the heart with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS. After post-ﬁxation overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde, the brain blocks (bregma þ1 to  3 mm)
were embedded in parafﬁn and coronal sectioned serially
(6 μm thick). The sections were processed for BrdU, CD34,
VEGF and DCX immunostaining as well as quantiﬁcation of
infarct volume. To examine the effect of VIP on brain levels of
VEGF, rats (four per group), which did not receive BrdU
injection, were euthanized by decapitation at 7 days after
MCAO for Western blotting analysis. Their brains were
quickly removed and the right hemisphere was dissected
and frozen immediately on dry ice to be stored at  80 1C until
use.

4.7.

Quantiﬁcation of infarct volume

Infarct volume was evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin
stained sections. The infarcted and contralateral hemispheric
areas were measured on 5 coronal sections (600 μm apart) per
rat using an image analysis system (Motic Images Advance
3.2). The infarct volume was calculated by multiplying the
infarct area of each section by the distance between successive sections and was presented as a percentage of the
volume of the contralateral hemisphere.

4.8.

Immunohistochemistry

The dewaxed parafﬁn sections were incubated in 3% H2O2 for
10 min, washed in double distilled water. For doublecortin
(DCX), CD34, VEGF antigen retrieval, sections were placed in

microwave for 10 min. For BrdU immunostaining, sections
were pretreated to denature DNA by incubating them in 4 N
HCl for 30 min at room temperature followed by digestion in
0.1% trypsase at 37 1C for 10 min. The sections were blocked
with 5% normal goat serum for 30 min, and incubated with
mouse monoclonal anti-VEGF (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), goat polyclonal anti-doublecortin (1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), mouse monoclonal anti-BrdU (1:200; LabVision Corporation NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA, USA) and rabbit polyclonal anti-CD34 (1:100; Bioster Biotech, WuHan, China)
overnight at 4 1C. After being washed in PBS, the sections
were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG or anti-goat
IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Bioster Biotech, WuHan, China)
for 20 min at 37 1C. Consequently, the sections were incubated in a solution of ABC (Bioster Biotech, WuHan, China) for
20 min at 37 1C followed by visualization using 3,3″-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) substrate kit (Bioster
Biotech, WuHan, China). Negative control experiments consisted of staining brain coronal tissue sections as outlined
above, but omitted or pre-absorbed the primary antibody and
omitted the secondary antibody.

Data quantiﬁcation and analysis

Fields of view was deﬁned in the dorsolateral ventricle wall of
SVZ for quantiﬁcation of BrdU, DCX and VEGF immunoreactivity, and in the peri-infarct striatum for counting CD34
immunoreactive vessels, as shown in Fig. 3.
To evaluate BrdU and VEGF immunohistochemistry, three
BrdU or VEGF-immunostained coronal sections at 100 μm
interval from each rat were digitized under a  40 objective
using an image analysis system (Motic Images Advance 3.2).
The total number of BrdU or VEGF immunoreactive cells in
each ﬁeld of view was counted. Results were expressed as the
average number of BrdU or VEGF cells per section.
For semiquantiﬁcation of DCX immunoreactivity, three
DCX immunostained coronal sections (100 μm apart) of each
rat were analyzed. DCX immunoreactivity in the SVZ of
ischemic hemisphere in each section was captured with a
threshold optical density that discriminated staining from
background, and analyzed using an image analysis system
(Motic Images Advance 3.2). The data are presented as a
percent (positive pixels/total pixels) calculated for ﬁelds of
view.
To quantify BrdU immunoreactive endothelial cells, the
numbers of endothelial cells and the numbers of BrdU
immunoreactive endothelial cells in 10 enlarged and thinwalled vessels in the SVZ of ischemic hemisphere were
counted from each rat. Data are presented as the percentage
of BrdU immunoreactive endothelial cells out of the total
endothelial cells in 10 enlarged vessels from each rat.
For measurement of cerebral vascular density, three CD34immunostained coronal sections (100 μm apart) from each rat
were analyzed under a  20 objective using an image analysis
system (Motic Images Advance 3.2). The numbers of CD34
immunoreactive vessels in ﬁve ﬁelds of view of the ischemic
boundary area of striatum in each section was counted. The
total number of vessels was divided by the total area of the
ﬁeld of view in the striatum to determine vascular density.

Western blotting analysis

Protein levels of VEGF in brain were estimated by Western
blotting analysis, and β-actin was used as a loading control.
The tissue samples were homogenized with a glass tissue
grinder in ice cold buffer (50 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 8.0,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and 100 mg/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride). Homogenates were centrifuged for
5 min at 12,000g (4 1C) and the supernatants were collected.
Protein concentrations for all samples were assayed using the
Bradford assay against bovine serum albumin standards.
Samples containing equal amounts of protein (100 μg) were
electrophoresed on 10% sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel and then elecrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes (Sigma). The
membranes were blocked in 20 mM Tris-buffered saline0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.5) containing 5% dried skim milk at
room temperature for 2 h. Thereafter, the proteins were
identiﬁed by incubation of the membranes with mouse
monoclonal antibody against VEGF (1:200, Santa Cruz, Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and rabbit polyclonal
antibody against β-actin (1:200) (Boster Biotech, WuHan,
China) overnight at 4 1C. The membranes were then incubated with the corresponding HRP-labeled secondary antibodies (1:500, Boster Biotech, WuHan, China) at room
temperature for 2 h. The blots were developed with a diaminobenzidine (DAB) detection kit (Boster Biotech, WuHan,
China), and OD of each blot was determined by using
Imaging-Pro Plus 5.0 software. The VEGF expression level
was expressed as the percentage of OD of β-actin. To
determine the speciﬁc binding of the antibody to the protein,
another membrane was stained in a similar manner but
without the primary antibody.

Statistical analysis

Analyses of statistical signiﬁcance were performed with
Student's t-test. The data are presented as mean7S.D. Values
of Po0.05 are considered signiﬁcant.
