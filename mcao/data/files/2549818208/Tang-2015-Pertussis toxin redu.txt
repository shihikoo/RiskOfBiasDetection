Abstract
Increased calcium inﬂux secondary to glutamate induced
excitotoxicity initiates and potentiates devastating pathological
changes following ischemic stroke. Pertussis toxin (PTx), a Gprotein blocker, is known to suppress intracellular calcium
accumulation. We hypothesize that PTx can protect against
stroke by blocking calcium inﬂux. In a permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion model, PTx (1000 ng) was given
intraperitoneally 30 min after inducing stroke. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of perfusion and T2-weighted brain scans
were obtained to evaluate cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) and
infarct volume. Primary neuronal culture was used to test
glutamate induced excitotoxicity and calcium inﬂux. We
established a non-linear exponential curve model to minimize

Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death in the United
States and other developed countries (Feigin et al. 2014).
Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of
stroke have generated a plethora of new investigative studies in
the treatment of stroke. However, despite evidence of efﬁcacy
in animal models of stroke, there has been little success in
clinical translation other than tissue plasminogen activator,
even that has a strict time window for administration.
While ischemic stroke results in an immediate core region
with complete tissue necrosis, adjacent penumbra regions are
potentially salvageable. Numerous research efforts have
targeted at cellular protection of the penumbra (Barone
2009). The detrimental pathological events in the penumbra

variations in animal cerebrovasculature. A reduction of 40–
60% in relative CBF was a critical window where infarct
volume started to increase as rCBF reduced. PTx showed
maximal effects in reducing infarct volume at this window. In
vitro studies further demonstrated PTx increased neuronal cell
survival by decreasing glutamate-induced calcium inﬂux into
neurons and preventing neurons from apoptosis. PTx salvages the ischemic penumbra by blocking calcium inﬂux. This
provides us a new mechanism upon which experimental
therapies can be explored to treat ischemic stroke.

Pertussis toxin protects against stroke

could be attributed to excessive glutamate induced excitotoxicity (Lai et al. 2014). As a consequence of overstimulated glutamate receptors, there is increased calcium inﬂux,
which in turn releases internal calcium and rapidly elevates
intracellular calcium to a level far beyond what mitochondria
can handle (Giorgi et al. 2012). This calcium overload
triggers mitochondrial stress, energy production failure, and
eventually apoptosis.
Pertussis toxin (PTx), an exotoxin produced by bordetella
pertussis, blocks a subtype of G-protein (Go/i). Several lines
of evidence indicate PTx blocks intracellular calcium elevation. For example, PTx abolishes a sustained calcium plateau
phase in human umbilical vein endothelia (Wellner et al.
1999); PTx blocks CCR5-ligand induced calcium peak in
lymphocytes (Alkhatib et al. 1997). Furthermore, the
reduced intracellular calcium level as a result of PTx
intervention is associated with improved cell survival in a
glioma cell line (Shinno et al. 1994). In addition, GluR5mediated calcium entry into neural axons is considered to be
a major contributing factor for axonal degeneration whereas
PTx blocks the calcium elevation (Ouardouz et al. 2009).
Contrary with these observations, PTx fails to block
endothelin-induced calcium elevation in cardiac myocytes
(Woo and Lee 1999) or calcium inﬂux through voltage-gated
calcium channels in smooth muscle cells (England and
McFadzean 1995). PTx has no effects on neuronal dendritic
calcium signal mediated by R type calcium channel (Melliti
et al. 2000). Apparently, the effects of PTx on intracellular
calcium may vary depending on tissue types or experimental
conditions. Here, we hypothesize that PTx reduces the
glutamate-induced intracellular calcium elevation to protect
against ischemic stroke.

Materials and methods
Animals
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Taconic (Oxnard, CA, USA).
All animals were housed in pathogen free conditions at the animal
facilities of the Barrow Neurological Institute. All experimental
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Barrow Neurological Institute and performed
according to the Revised Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.
Thirty (30) C57BL/6 male mice (age 10–14 weeks) were randomly
divided into either a PTx-treatment group or a control group, i.e. 15
mice in each group (Figure S1 and Table S1). The average weight was
25.3  1.4 g in the PTx-treatment group and 24.4  1.8 g in the
control group. Randomization was based on alternating selection of
mice whoever came the next upon arrival. People who performed the
surgery, immunohistochemistry and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) were blinded to the randomization.
Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
Mice were under Ketamine/Xylazine anesthesia (80 mg/kg Ketamine and 10 mg/kg Xylazine, injected intraperitoneal, i.p.). Stan-

999

dard aseptic surgical procedures were used throughout the
procedure. The animals were kept warm with a carefully monitored
heating lamp to maintain body temperature at 37°C during surgery
and recovery after surgery. Following the induction of anesthesia,
the surgical site was cleaned, and the hair was shaved with an
electric razor. The exposed skin was then disinfected. Ophthalmic
ointment was applied to the eyes to prevent drying during the
procedure. A 6-0 surgical nylon monoﬁlament with a rounded tip
was introduced into the right internal carotid artery through the
external carotid stump. It was then advanced 10–11 mm past
the carotid bifurcation until a slight resistance was felt. At this point,
the intraluminal ﬁlament blocked the origin of the middle cerebral
artery (Yin et al. 2015). After the permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO) procedure, mice were monitored carefully to
assure temperature regulation while recovering from anesthesia.
Mice was housed one per cage for recovery. Food, water, and
hydrating gel were made available on the ﬂoor of the cage. Mice
were monitored daily for any signs of infection, and antibiotics
would be administered as needed. In our experience, surgical site
infections were uncommon. Analgesics would be administered for
any signs of distress, as per animal care facility guidelines.
Pertussis toxin treatment
In our previous studies (Tang et al. 2013; Yin et al. 2014b), we
tested different doses of PTx, including 100, 200, 400 and 1000 ng;
and different route of administration including intracerebroventricular, intravenous, and i.p. injections. The results showed 1000 ng
had the most efﬁcacy without toxicity and i.p. was the most
convenient route without irritation. Thirty minutes after inducing
pMCAO, we injected either PTx (List Biological laboratories Inc.)
i.p. (1000 ng in 1.0 mL phosphate-buffered saline) in the treatment
group or the same volume phosphate-buffered saline (1.0 mL) in the
control group.
Perfusion and T2-weighted brain images by a 7 Tesla-magnetic
resonance imaging
MRI was performed on a 7T small animal MRI, 30-cm horizontalbore magnet, and a BioSpec Avance III spectrometer (Bruker
Daltonics Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) with a 116-mm high power
gradient set (600 mT/m) and a 72-mm whole-body mouse transmit/
surface coil conﬁguration (Yin et al. 2014a). Isoﬂurane anesthesia
was induced and maintained for each animal at 3% and 1.5%
respectively. It was delivered with medical air at 1.5 L/min. During
MRI scan, the animal’s respiration was continually monitored by a
small animal monitoring and gating system (SA Instruments, Stoney
Brook, NY, USA) via a pillow sensor positioned under the
abdomen. Mice were placed on a heated circulating water blanket
(Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) to maintain body temperature at 36–
37°C. T2-weighted images were acquired 24 h after pMCAO to
assess the infarct volume, using a Rapid Acquisition with Refocused
Echoes sequence with parameters: TR = 3000 ms, effective
TE = 60 ms, Rapid Acquisition with Refocused Echoes factor = 8.
20 slices were acquired with thickness = 0.5 mm, ﬁeld of view

order to assess the cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) in the MCA territory,
images were acquired 24 h after pMCAO, using a Continuous
Arterial Spin Labeling sequence with parameters: TR = 3000 ms,
TE = 6.95 ms, segments = 4, slice thickness = 1.5 mm, ﬁeld of

MRI data were analyzed using the MEDx3.4.3 software package (Medical Numerics, Germantown, MD, USA) on a LINUX
workstation.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were euthanized with isoﬂurane anesthesia at 24 h after
inducing pMCAO. They were then perfused intracardiacally with
saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde for a total of 30 min. The
ﬁxed brain was embedded in parafﬁn and cut into serial 6 lm thick
coronal slides. Immunohistochemistry was performed with antibodies against caspase-3 (#9662S; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA, USA). Immunolabeling was detected by applying the peroxidase-antiperoxidase procedure with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine as a cosubstrate. Respective negative controls that omit primary antibodies
and positive controls were applied for each case. Digital images
were collected by using a microscope (Bx53; Olympus America
Inc., Center Valley, PA, USA) under the bright ﬁeld setting. The
number and the density of positively stained cells were counted at
409 magniﬁcation in matched sections. Results were presented as
positive cells per mm2, with areas measured from 409 images using
Image J.1.34vi software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda,
MD, USA).
Primary neuronal culture
To prepare primary neuronal culture, cells were collected from
cerebral cortices of 0 or 1-day-old C57/BL6 mouse pups (Taconic,
Hudson, NY, USA). Pups were dipped in 95% ethanol inside a cell
culture hood at 23–25°C. The meninges were removed under a
dissecting microscope on top of ice. The cortices were cut and minced
mechanically in the Neurobasal Medium (#21103-049; Life technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Tissues were incubated in Papain
digestion solution (#LS003124; Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ, USA) at 37°C for 20 min with continuous
shaking (150 rpm, ThermoScientic MaxQ5000 shaker, Waltham,
MA, USA). Digestion was stopped by adding 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (#f2442; Sigma-Aldrich Co, St Louis, MO, USA). The
solution was ﬁltered through a 70 lm cell strainer. It was centrifuged
for 3 min (250 g) to remove the supernatant at 23–25°C. Resuspended cells were placed into Poly-D-lysine covered dishes in the
Neurobasal Medium supplemented with 0.5% L-glutamine and 2%
B27 serum-free supplement (#17504-001; Life technologies). They
were cultured in the 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. Medium was
replaced every 3–4 days.
Lactate dehydrogenase and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide tetrazolium reduction assays
Glutamate excitotoxicity was measured using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-based CytoTox96-non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay
kit (TOX7; Sigma-Aldrich Co) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. The absorbance was measure at 490 nm. Each
assay was tested in triplicate. Percentage of speciﬁc lysis was
determined as: (Experimental release  target spontaneous release)/
(Target maximum release  target spontaneous release) 9 100.
The maximum release was determined by detecting the absorbance
of the target cells lysed with LDH assay lysis solution. Viability of
glutamate-treated neurons was tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Data were

expressed as percentage of viable cells compared with the control
culture.
Calcium imaging
On day 10, primary neurons on coverslips were washed in warmed
Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). They were then incubated in
a 35 mm dish containing 2 mL Fluo-3/AM work solution (3 lM
Fluo-3/AM in HBSS) for 20 min at 37°C. Coverslips were washed
again in HBSS and placed on the stage of laser scanning confocal
microscope (LSM710; Carl Zeiss Inc. Oberkochen, Germany). For
live cell calcium imaging, cells were excited with 488 nm light from
an argon laser. The emission was detected at 530 nm. The cells were
scanned once per second for 240 s. After 60 s of baseline recording
in HBSS, cells were exposed to glutamate (50 lM
glumatatme + 10 lM glycine) in HBSS for 180 s (Pickering et al.
2008). The intensity of the ﬂuorescence in each cell was recorded,
which represented the concentration of intracellular calcium. The
intensity of baseline was normalized to 1, and data were presented as
folds increased than the baseline.
Power analysis and statistics
Power analysis was performed by using online tool developed
by Statistical Solutions LLC (http://www.statisticalsolutions.net/
pss_calc.php). According to human PET studies, a normal CBF
was averaged 22 mL and the critical neuronal damage CBF was
12–14 mL with a variance of approximate 12 mL (Powers
et al. 1985). We stratiﬁed each group into three subgroups
according to relative CBF (rCBF) < 0.4, 0.4–0.6, and > 0.6.
Based on our previous studies, we needed a minimum of four
mice in each of the six subgroups to have a power of 0.8 for
statistics. We also knew that the mortality rate was about 20%
in this model. Therefore, we decided to have a total of 30 mice
for the study.
Results are presented as the means  standard deviation.
Regression analysis was performed by GraphPad-prism 5 software
(GraphPad Software Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA). For exponential
regression, the formula is presented as: Y = (Y0  Plateau) 9 exp
(K 9 X) + Plateau. Unpaired Student’s t-test was used for
comparison between two groups, while one way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) for multiple groups to determine the signiﬁcance
of the difference.

Results
Correlation of CBF and infarct volume
Perfusion MRI allows early assessment of CBF during
ischemia. We used perfusion MRI to limit variations in
infarct size that were caused by variations in cerebrovasculature. The region of interest for perfusion was at the center
of MCA territory (Fig. 1a and b). It was represented by three
0.5 mm-thick slices. The infarct volume was measured in
these three slices and in all slices, while perfusion was
measured in the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres in
three slices. The rCBF was deﬁned as ipsilateral/contralateral
in corresponding regions.
Infarction is caused by a reduction in CBF (Fig. 1b). The
infarct size was correlated with the degree of reduced CBF.

When the rCBF was decreased under 0.4, the infarct volume
was the largest: 29.0  5.85 mm3 in the three center slices and
105.7  21.12 mm3 in all slices. When the rCBF was between
0.4 and 0.6, the infarct volume was 5.1  1.08 mm3 in the
three center slices and 12.3  3.8 mm3 in all slices. When the
rCBF was more than 0.6, no infarction was observed.
Linear regression was performed to assess infarct volume
in the three center slices and in all slices (Fig. 1d1). The
correlation coefﬁcient R2 was high (0.9802, p < 0.0001),
suggesting the three center slices could be used to represent
the whole brain involved in MCA stroke. Regression analysis
was performed to assess the correlation between CBF and
infarct volume. Absolute CBF in the MCA territory was
correlated with infarct volume in the three center slices
(R2 = 0.9038) (Fig. 1c1). rCBF showed a slightly better

correlation coefﬁcient (R2 = 0.9626) (Fig. 1c2). Consistently, rCBF was correlated well with infarct volume in all
slices (R2 = 0.9559) (Fig. 1d2).
PTx treatment attenuated infarct volume after pMCAO
The mortality rate was 16.7% in the PTx-treatment group and
13.3% in the control group. During the study, two animals
died from anesthesia overdose and one from massive stroke
in the PTx-treatment group; while one died from anesthesia
overdose and one from massive stroke in the control group.
We excluded them from the study. The 25 survived mice (12
in PTx group and 13 in the control group) were scanned with
MRI to measure the CBF and infarction volume. Regression
analysis showed that PTx treatment shifted the exponential
model predicting infarct volume based on rCBF (Fig. 2a).

When the rCBF was decreased under 0.4, the infarct volume
was the largest: 105.7  21.12 mm3 in the control group
(n = 5) and 101.0  16.01 mm3 in PTx group (n = 3,
p = 0.751). When the rCBF was between 0.4 and 0.6, the
infarct volume was reduced by PTx treatment
(12.3  3.8 mm3 in the control group, n = 4 and
2.12  1.58 mm3 in PTx group, n = 5, p < 0.01). When
the rCBF was more than 0.6 (n = 4 each), no lesion was
observed in either group (Fig. 2b). Absolute CBF was
measured in both ipsilateral (ischemic) and contralateral
(non-ischemic) hemispheres in two groups. According to the
rCBF, they were divided into three groups: high CBF, middle
CBF, and low CBF (Fig. 2c). In the low CBF group, the
absolute CBF (aCBF) in the ipsilateral hemisphere was
42.9  7.8 mL/100 g/min in the control group and
37.4  4.4 mL/100 g/min in the PTx treatment group; in
the contralateral hemisphere, it was 141.4  12.7 versus
134.7  25.8 mL/100 g/min. In the middle CBF group, it
was 77.2  10.6 versus 77.0  14.5 mL/100 g/min in the
ipsilateral
hemisphere
and
151.3  19.3
versus
153.6  28.1 mL/100 g/min in the contralateral hemisphere. In the high CBF group, it was 115.9  8.4 versus
117.4  3.8 mL/100 g/min in the ipsilateral hemisphere and
174.4  6.2 versus 173.3  6.4 mL/100 g/min in the contralateral hemisphere. Thus, PTx treatment did not change
the aCBF in either ischemic or non-ischemic sides, suggesting the outcome of PTx treatment as we described next was
(a)

not a direct effect from enhanced blood ﬂow, but a
consequence of neuroprotection in the presence of reduced
blood ﬂow.
PTx treatment increased neurons survival after glutamateinduced cell death in vitro
Primary culture neurons were used to test whether PTx
treatment could protect neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity as it often occurs during ischemic stroke. MTT assay
showed that glutamate treatment reduced the survival of
neurons, while PTx treatment saved them. The survived
neurons were reduced to 0.618  0.06 after glutamate
treatment (the baseline control was normalized to 1,
p < 0.01). When PTx was added before the glutamate
treatment, the survived neurons increased to 1.1  0.12
(p < 0.01, Fig. 3a and b). LDH is a soluble cytosolic enzyme
that is released into the culture medium following loss of
membrane integrity. Its release correlates with cell lysis.
Glutamate increased LDH release to 1.31  0.11 (the baseline control was normalized to 1, p < 0.01). PTx treatment
reversed this increase (0.76  0.08, p < 0.01, Fig. 3c).
PTx treatment decreased glutamate-induced calcium influx
into neurons
Calcium imaging was performed to measure the intracellular
calcium. The intensity of ﬂuorescence which represented the
concentration of intracellular calcium increased sharply and

When rCBF was between 0.4 and 0.6 (the middle CBF group), PTx

treatment attenuated infarct volume (n = 5, *p < 0.01); PTx treatment
did not attenuate the infarct volume when rCBF was lower than 0.4 (the
low CBF group); or higher than 0.6 (the high CBF group, virtually no
infarction were observed). (c) absolute CBF (aCBF) was measured in
both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, no signiﬁcant difference
was seen in control and PTx treated mice when they were divided into
3 groups according to the rCBF level.

Discussion
C57BL/6J mice are favored in research because they can be
genetically manipulated and are commonly used in creating
transgenic models. However, this model manifest variations
in anatomy and collateral circulation which result in a wide
range of stroke volume despite attempts to control the site
and size of stroke using a number of techniques (Taguchi
et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010; Zhang et al. 2010; Doyle
et al. 2012). Lack of blood ﬂow during focal ischemia is the
key factor in determining the infarct volume. However, there
is no reported quantitative model describing the accurate
relationship between these two parameters.

In this study, we obtained perfusion MRI early in the
course of stroke to determine the correlation of stroke
volume with perfusion results. We hypothesized that a
comprehensive measurement of CBF in the MCA territory
would predict the infarct volume. We found that the best
ﬁtting model was a non-linear exponential curve. As long as
rCBF was reduced no < 60% of normal ﬂow, the brain tissue

could tolerate CBF reduction without infarction. 40–60%
was a critical rCBF window where infarct volume started to
increase as rCBF reduced. When rCBF was < 40%, infarct
volume increased at an accelerated rate. Thus, we could use
rCBF at the onset of ischemia to predict the ﬁnal infarct
outcome based on this quantitative model. In human PET
studies, aCBF above 22 mL/100 g/min was regarded as an

if the blood ﬂow is maintained above this threshold.
However, tissues with CBF < 12–14 mL/100 g/min were
found to be infarcted on late CTs (Lenzi et al. 1982; Powers
et al. 1985; Heiss 2011). Therefore, the lower threshold (12–
14 mL/100 g/min) is approximately 55–60% of the upper
threshold (22 mL). Our mice model had a critical rCBF at
60% similar to the stroke condition in human.
Next, we applied this quantitative model to test the
neuroprotective effects of PTx in ischemic penumbra. PTx
had strong protective effects in the 40–60% rCBF window.
In fact, PTx treatment shifted the critical rCBF that could
lead to inevitable infarction from 60% to 40%. This was not
due to a change in CBF because PTx did not affect absolute
CBF. Instead, PTx enhanced the neuronal survivability in the
event of reduced CBF.
To further understand how PTx enhanced the neuronal
survivability, we examined three pivotal molecular events in
the stroke penumbra: glutamate toxicity, calcium overload,
and caspase activity. In the event of stroke, necrotic tissues in
the core released excessive amount of glutamate in the
milieu. Glutamate activates NMDA receptor on neighboring
penumbral neurons and induces pathological depolarization,
which further induces glutamate release, calcium inﬂux, and
mitochondrial stress. This vicious cycle is regarded as a
pathophysiological loop exacerbating the infarction (Hossmann 1996, 2006). Using cultured neurons, we constructed a
glutamate toxicity model. PTx treatment rescued cells from
glutamate toxicity. PTx itself did not compromise the
neuronal survival, which is consistent with our previous
report on the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelopathy model of multiple sclerosis (Yin et al. 2010; Tang
et al. 2013).
Downstream of the cascade, glutamate induces excessive
calcium inﬂux resulting in calcium overload. Using calcium
imaging approach, we found that PTx signiﬁcantly attenuated glutamate-induced calcium inﬂux in neurons. The
potential mechanisms are the reduced depolarization or
enhanced calcium extrusion or sequestration. While the
detailed events are not clear, PTx may block the intrinsic Gprotein that positively modulates NMDA receptor function
under physiological condition (Haak 1999), thus reducing
NMDA channel opening. Furthermore, the calcium response
curve showed a slight undulating pattern at least in the
initial two cycles. This oscillation-like pattern may suggest
an enhanced calcium pump function (Guisoni et al. 2015).
In addition to calcium ﬂow through NMDA receptor ion
channels, calcium current through voltage gated calcium
channels may be subject to modulation by PTx (Kashihara
et al. 2012). In cardiac ventricular myocytes, for example,
PTx by itself does not change L-type calcium current under
physiological conditions, but PTx prevents isoprenololinduced calcium augmentation, thus contributing to a
negative inotropic effect (Kashihara et al. 2012). However,

it remains unknown whether neuronal calcium channels are
subject to PTx modulation in a similar way. Regardless the
detailed mechanisms, the dramatic reduction of calcium
inﬂux, measured as area under the curve, is a clear
indication of protective capacity. Furthermore, the calcium
overload in penumbral tissue exerts mitochondrial stress and
consequently activates the intrinsic apoptotic cascade executed by caspase-3. We measured the activated caspase-3
density and the caspase-3 positive neurons in penumbra.
Both were signiﬁcant reduced when the animal was treated
with PTx.

Conclusions
Relative CBF at 40–60% constitute a quantitative therapeutic
window. We tested a new experimental therapy of using
PTx. PTx salvages the penumbra and reduces apoptosis by
protecting the neuron from glutamate toxicity, downsizing
calcium overload and inhibiting caspase-3 activity.
