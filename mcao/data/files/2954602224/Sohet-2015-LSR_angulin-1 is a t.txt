T

he blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a term used to describe the unique properties of central nervous system
(CNS) blood vessels. One important BBB property
is the formation of a paracellular barrier made by tight
junctions (TJs) between CNS endothelial cells (ECs). Here,
we show that Lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor
(LSR), a component of paracellular junctions at points in
which three cell membranes meet, is greatly enriched in
CNS ECs compared with ECs in other nonneural tissues.
We demonstrate that LSR is specifically expressed at

tricellular junctions and that its expression correlates with
the onset of BBB formation during embryogenesis. We
further demonstrate that the BBB does not seal during embryogenesis in Lsr knockout mice with a leakage to small
molecules. Finally, in mouse models in which BBB was disrupted, including an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis and a middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke, LSR
was down-regulated, linking loss of LSR and pathological
BBB leakage.

Introduction
Blood vessels play a critical role in the delivery of oxygen and
nutrients throughout the body. The capillary bed of each tissue
is comprised of endothelial cell (ECs), which form the walls
of the blood vessels, and pericytes, which sit on the abluminal
surface of the endothelial tube. In the central nervous system
(CNS), ECs contain a series of specialized properties, termed
the blood–brain barrier (BBB), that allows them to protect neural cells from blood-borne toxic molecules, pathogens, and fluctuations of ion concentrations. CNS ECs are held together by
tight junctions (TJs), which generate a tight paracellular barrier,
undergo extremely low rates of transcytosis, and contain highly
specific transport mechanisms. Together, these properties allow
CNS ECs to tightly regulate the movement of solutes between
the blood and the brain (Daneman, 2012; Siegenthaler et al.,
2013; Sohet and Daneman, 2013). Loss of these barrier properties in different diseases including multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke,
Alzheimer’s disease, and epilepsy can lead to neuronal dysfunction and degeneration (Daneman, 2012). Thus, understanding

the molecular mechanisms that regulate barrier properties might
help in the discovery of new therapeutic targets that could help
restore the BBB in patients with different neurological diseases.
The formation of the paracellular TJs is critical for this
barrier, as it generates polarized cells with distinct luminal and
abluminal composition, allowing transport properties to determine the movement of molecules across the cell barrier. TJs,
first characterized by studies in epithelial cells, are formed by
intercellular adhesions between the transmembrane proteins
claudins, occludin, and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs),
which are linked to the cytoskeleton and adherens junctions
by adaptor molecules such as zonula occludens (ZO) proteins.
Claudins, a family of tetraspanin genes with >20 members in
mammals (Günzel and Yu, 2013), form homotypic and heterotypic interactions that are critical for the paracellular barrier
in different epithelial cells. Claudins are expressed in a tissuespecific manner, and the specific claudin family member determines the specific permeability of the TJ in each tissue. Claudin
5 is the major TJ protein expressed in ECs, and Cldn5 knockout mice die at birth with a BBB leaky to small molecules

Results and discussion
LSR is expressed at tricellular TJs
in CNS ECs

We first examined LSR expression in different organs by immuno­
staining tissue sections of brain, liver, lung, and intestine for
LSR and double-labeling for ECs with an antibody directed
against CD31 (Fig. 1 A). In each of these organs there is robust
LSR expression. However, LSR expression only colocalizes
with CD31+ ECs in the brain and not in the peripheral organs.
In the peripheral tissues, LSR staining is restricted to epithelial
cells (lung, intestine) or hepatocytes (liver). These results confirm that Lsr is highly enriched in brain ECs compared with
liver, lung, and intestinal ECs.
To precisely define LSR sublocalization, we performed
triple-labeling of mouse brain tissue sections with BSL I (to
label endothelial membranes), occludin (a marker of the bicellular TJ), and LSR. High-magnification images demonstrate
that occludin stains bicellular TJ, whereas LSR has a punctate
expression localized to points where multiple occludin bicellular TJs meet, i.e., the tricellular junction (Fig. 1 B). Although
LSR is largely enriched at the tricellular junction, lower expression levels can also be observed at the bicellular junctions. We
observed the same expression pattern throughout the mouse
brain and SC in all capillaries, arteries, and veins (Fig. S1 A),
with the notable exceptions of the vessels in the choroid plexus
and circumventricular organs. In the choroid plexus, LSR is
localized at tricellular TJ of the tight epithelial cells but is absent from the leaky vessels (Fig. S1 B). LSR expression is also
absent from the ECs of the circumventricular organs, which
contain leaky vessels that are not part of the BBB (Fig. S1 A).
Therefore, LSR protein in CNS ECs is largely expressed at the
tricellular junctions of BBB-possessing vessels, which confirms
a similar recent observation (Iwamoto et al., 2014).
We sought to determine the time course of LSR expression during development. Angiogenesis in the mouse CNS initiates at E9, and proceeds in a caudal-to-rostral direction. We
examined LSR expression in the CNS of embryos from E10
onwards (Fig. 2). At E11.5, LSR is expressed throughout the cellular membrane of CNS ECs only at the caudal part of the SC.
By E12.5, LSR expression is still diffuse throughout the EC
membrane, but is expressed in vessels throughout the caudal–
rostral axis of the SC and is absent from forebrain ECs. At
E13.5, LSR is expressed in all blood vessels throughout the
CNS including the brain, but this expression still appears to be
diffuse throughout the EC membrane. Thus, LSR expression
follows angiogenesis in a caudal-to-rostral direction from E11.5
to E13.5. At postnatal day 3 (P3), LSR is localized mainly at
the bicellular/tricellular TJs, whereas at P12 the protein is further accumulated at the tricellular TJ and by P21 the protein is
largely enriched at the tricellular junction as it is in the adult
(Fig. S1 C and Fig. 1 B). Our results indicate that CNS EC
expression of LSR follows slightly behind CNS angiogenesis,
and as development proceeds more LSR is concentrated at the
tricellular TJ of CNS blood vessels.
Lsr is made of 10 exons with three different splice variants: , , and  (Yen et al., 2008; Stenger et al., 2012a). The

(<800 D; Nitta et al., 2003). Claudin 5 is expressed by ECs in
many tissues and thus its expression alone does not confer the
high resistance barrier that is specific to CNS ECs (Morita et al.,
1999). Claudin 3 and claudin 12 have also been described in
CNS ECs (Nitta et al., 2003; Liebner et al., 2008); however,
their exact roles remain to be investigated. Occludin, also a tetraspanin, is expressed in all epithelial cells and its expression
in ECs is enriched in the barrier containing ECs of the CNS
(Hirase et al., 1997; Daneman et al., 2010a). Occludin-deficient
mice, however, do not exhibit BBB leakage, only calcification
of the brain (Saitou et al., 2000). Thus, although several components of the BBB TJs have been identified, it remains unclear
why CNS ECs, but not ECs in other tissues, form these highresistance TJs.
Ikenouchi et al. (2005) described tricellulin, a new subtype
of TJ protein expressed in epithelial cells at points where three
cells meet. More recently, in epithelial cells, Lipolysis-stimulated
lipoprotein receptor (LSR) was described as a tricellular TJ protein required to recruit tricellulin to the epithelial tricellular TJs
(Masuda et al., 2011). LSR contains an extracellular N-terminal
Ig domain followed by a single transmembrane region and a
cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (Stenger et al., 2012a). The original
role of the protein was described in lipid metabolism studies, as
LSR was first discovered to be expressed in hepatocytes, where
it plays a role in the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins
and low-density lipoproteins, and also acts as a apolipoprotein
B/E–containing lipoprotein receptor (Stenger et al., 2012a). Lsr
knockout mice die before embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5), but the
cause of death remains unclear (Mesli et al., 2004). Two additional members of the tricellular TJ family were described in mice
epithelial cells, both LSR-related proteins: immunoglobulin-like
domain containing receptor ILDR1 and ILDR2 (Higashi et al.,
2013). LSR, ILDR1, and ILDR2 share a complementary expression in many epithelium and all recruit tricellulin. Therefore,
these three proteins have been named the angulin family, with
angulin-1 (LSR), angulin-2 (ILDR1), and angulin-3 (ILDR2).
Previously, using EC purification and microarray analysis, we were able to compare the gene expression of CNS ECs
with ECs from the liver and lung, identifying a dataset of BBBenriched genes (Daneman et al., 2010a). Interestingly, tricellulin and LSR were both enriched in CNS ECs compared with
peripheral ECs, which suggests that tricellular junctions may be
critical for the formation of the BBB. Here, we find that LSR
is expressed at the tricellular TJ in mice brain and spinal cord
(SC) ECs, but not in ECs in peripheral tissues. We describe
LSR expression during development and show that it follows
CNS angiogenesis and correlates with BBB formation during
embryogenesis. Using dye injections into developing embryos,
we show that in wild-type mice the BBB seals during embryonic development at E14.5, whereas in Lsr knockout embryos
the BBB fails to seal and is leaky to small molecule tracers.
We further demonstrate that in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO), murine models of neurological disorders in which
BBB is disrupted, LSR is down-regulated in CNS ECs. Collectively, these data identify a critical role of LSR for proper BBB
formation and function.

from purified brain ECs and liver ECs. Analysis indicates no detectable LSR expression in liver ECs but high expression of the  variant followed by  and
 variants in brain ECs. (C, middle and right) Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of LSR variants from whole brain, lung, and liver. The expression in liver is
much higher than brain or lung, and thus was given its own y axis (right). Splice variant composition is similar between brain and liver (’ variant followed
by  and  variants) but different in the lung ( variant followed by ’ and  variants). Data represent means ± SD (error bars) from three indipendent
experiments. (D) Western blot profile of LSR from purified brain capillaries shows a stronger band for the  splice variant followed by  and .

 splice variant translates a full-length protein that has an external C terminus, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic
N-terminal tail. The  and  splice variants lack a putative
dileucine signal, and the  lacks almost the entirety of the transmembrane domain. The association of // is important in
the binding of lipoproteins in the liver (Yen et al., 1999, 2008).
We assessed LSR splice variant composition in purified CNS
ECs by qRT-PCR and identified that the main LSR splice variant is  followed by  and lastly  (Fig. 1 C). No LSR mRNA
was detectable in purified liver ECs, which is consistent with
the immunohistochemistry results (Fig. 1 A). We confirmed
this data by Western blot analysis on purified mouse brain
capillaries (Fig. 1 D) where the main band corresponds to 
(64 kD), the  band has a lower density (66 kD), and the  has
the weakest signal (58 kD). To compare LSR splice variant
expression between different organs, we performed qRT-PCR
from whole brain, lung, and liver (Fig. 1 C). In the liver, LSR is
expressed primarily in hepatocytes, with  being the main LSR
variant, followed by  and , similar to the brain but with much
higher expression levels. In the lung, LSR is expressed in epithelial cells, with  being the main LSR splice variant followed
by  and then . This structural difference might define a distinct function of LSR in different cell types.

The importance of Lsr gene inactivation for
BBB formation

To understand the physiological role of LSR at the BBB, we
compared the structure and function of CNS ECs in Lsr/,
Lsr+/, and Lsr+/+ mice. Lsr/ mice have been previously generated and display embryonic lethality before E15.5 (Mesli
et al., 2004). Lsr/ embryos have a smaller liver and present
dorsal skin detachment, but the exact cause of death remains
unclear. Lsr+/ mice are born in a Mendelian ratio but have high
plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels during the postprandial phase (Yen et al., 2008).
The key question is to determine whether the barrier function of the CNS blood vessels is compromised in the Lsr/ or
Lsr+/ embryos. To determine if small molecules can cross the
BBB in Lsr/ or Lsr+/ embryos, we developed a method to assess BBB permeability to dyes in dissected embryos. It has been
demonstrated that the BBB is functional during embryogenesis
(Daneman et al., 2010b; Ben-Zvi et al., 2014); here we performed
a time course examining precisely at which time point the BBB
seals during embryonic development. To achieve this, we performed tracer injections on dissected embryos to determine the
time course of BBB leakage during early embryogenesis. We
performed Caesarean sections of pregnant females, extracted

is expressed in all blood vessels throughout the
CNS. Bars: (left) 1.25 mm; (right) 20 µm.

single embryos that remained attached to the placenta, and injected dyes into their heart using a glass capillary needle connected to an automated syringe pump. We only analyzed data
from living embryos by ensuring that the heartbeat was maintained throughout the experiment. Any embryo whose heart
stopped beating during the experiment was not analyzed. We
used Sulfo-NHS-biotin (446 D) as a molecular tracer and analyzed leakage by staining tissue sections with a fluorophoreconjugated streptavidin.
We first performed a time course of biotin leakage in
wild-type embryos to examine BBB permeability of embryos
from E12.5 to E16.5 (Fig. 3 A). This analysis reveals that the
dye leaks through the BBB until E13.5 but is greatly restricted

from E14.5 to E16.5. Thus, the BBB is permeable for the first
few days after the initiation of CNS angiogenesis, then it seals
to this small molecule starting at E14.5. Interestingly, this is
similar to the time course of LSR expression in the vessels. To
confirm that our method doesn’t disrupt the vasculature, we injected 10 kD rhodamine-dextran in E12.5 LSR embryos. Fig. S2
reveals minimal leakage in any of the genotypes. Thus, at E12.5,
CNS ECs are permeable to small molecules but have low permeability to large molecules. These results confirm that our
method can be used to assess BBB permeability in embryos
without disruption of vascular integrity.
Next, we examined whether LSR expression is necessary for BBB sealing during embryogenesis. We examined the

TJ proteins might not only be involved in sealing an epithelium or endothelium; they might have other functions. By
using different fixation methods (PFA fixed tissue), LSR expression has been visualized in specific neuronal subpopulations (Stenger et al., 2012b). By performing filipin staining,
the authors demonstrated an increase in membrane-associated free
cholesterol in specific brain regions of 18-mo-old Lsr+/ mice
compared with wild-type controls. This result suggests that
LSR might be important for cholesterol distribution within the
brain, where it localizes in membranes of glial cells and neurons,
and in myelin sheets (Dietschy and Turley, 2001). We performed
a filipin stain on E14.5 LSR embryos and examined the cholesterol distribution in the CNS. The staining was homogeneous
between Lsr/, Lsr+/, and Lsr+/+ embryos (unpublished data),
and quantification showed no difference in membrane-associated
free cholesterol between the groups (Fig. S3). At this age, the
whole brain cholesterol concentration is very low (<2 mg/g
compared with 20 mg/g in adults), which might explain why no
difference was observed (Dietschy and Turley, 2004).
LSR expression in neurological disorders

BBB disruption is a common component of many different neurological diseases including MS, stroke, trauma, and neurodegenerative disorders (Daneman, 2012). Therefore, identifying
the mechanisms that lead to this disruption may lead to therapeutics that limit the progression of these diseases. Here, we
examined LSR expression during EAE, a mouse model of MS,
and following a transient MCAO/reperfusion (MCAO) mouse
model of stroke.
4 d after the onset of symptoms of EAE, we compared
inflammatory lesions to unaffected white matter in the mouse
SC (Fig. 4 A). Co-labeling of immune cells (CD45) and endogenous IgG identified the locations where blood vessels had become inflamed and leaky. In these inflammatory lesions, LSR
was significantly down-regulated (38 ± 3%) compared with
blood vessels in unaffected regions within the same tissue section (Fig. 4 B). This suggests that BBB breakdown during EAE
is associated with loss of tricellular TJ proteins.
For MCAO, mice were subjected to 2 h of occlusion of
the middle cerebral artery followed by a 24-h reperfusion period. We localized the leaky blood vessels in the injured hemisphere by perfusing mice with biotin and then staining the
brain sections with a fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin dye (to
image the leakage; Fig. 4 C) and CD31 (to stain ECs; Fig. 4 C).
After selecting areas of vascular leakage in the ipsilateral hemisphere and their nonleaky vessel counterparts in the contralateral hemisphere, we performed a stain for LSR and focused
our observations in the selected area (Fig. 4 D). We observed
a significant down-regulation of LSR in the ipsilateral hemisphere (Fig. 4 E). These results suggest that loss of the tricellular TJ protein LSR is associated with BBB breakdown after
acute MCAO.
In conclusion, we have shown that LSR is specifically
expressed at the tricellular TJs of CNS blood vessels with an
expression that follows BBB maturation. As previously reported, Lsr knockout mice are embryonic lethal (Mesli et al.,
2004), and we have identified that the CNS blood vessels of

morphology of CNS blood vessels at a time point where LSR
is expressed throughout the embryo, E13.5. CD31 staining of
whole mount embryos didn’t reveal any major differences in
the length, branching, or overall structure of CNS blood vessels or hemorrhage (unpublished data). We then examined the
time course of BBB permeability in Lsr+/+, Lsr+/, and Lsr/
mice (Fig. 3 B). In Lsr+/+ and Lsr+/ mice, the BBB is highly
permeable to Sulfo-NHS-biotin at E12.5 and E13.5, but forms
a much more restrictive barrier by E14.5. In contrast, in Lsr/
mice the BBB is highly permeable to the tracer at E14.5
(Fig. 3, B and C), demonstrating that LSR is required for the
sealing of the BBB. Interestingly, the BBB of Lsr/ mice had
minimal permeability to large endogenous proteins, including
albumin (69 kD; Fig. 3 F), antibodies (160 kD), and fibrinogen
(52 kD; unpublished data). Thus, there is a size-selective permeability defect of the BBB in LSR-deficient mice, similar to the
one described for Cldn5 knockout mice. This suggests a common phenotype when disrupting bicellular and tricellular TJs,
where leakage of small molecules probably occurs through the
paracellular barrier, and therefore it seems that leakage of larger
molecules may require transcellular vesicle–mediated pathways
rather than paracellular pathways. It is important to note that in
this mouse model, Lsr is deleted throughout the organism, and
thus it remains possible that the leakage of the BBB is secondary
to the role of LSR in other cell types, including the liver, as liver
failure has been shown to lead to BBB disruption (Thumburu
et al., 2012). Electron microscopy studies will be required to
determine through which part of the ECs the small molecules
leak in LSR-deficient mice. We have also examined BBB permeability in Lsr+/ adult mice brains and did not find any leakage of a biotin tracer (unpublished data), which indicates that
one copy of Lsr is sufficient to seal the BBB throughout life.
We then studied the effect of Lsr deletion on the expression of bicellular TJ proteins. At the BBB, claudin 5, occludin,
and ZO1 are the main bicellular TJ proteins (Sohet and Daneman,
2013). We performed immunostaining of these TJ proteins on
tissue sections of E13.5 (unpublished data) and E14.5 Lsr/,
Lsr+/, and Lsr+/+ mouse embryos and focused our observations
on the blood vessels of the SC. We observed no difference in
expression or localization of claudin 5 protein between Lsr/,
Lsr+/, and Lsr+/+ embryos at both ages (Fig. 3 D). Similarly, we
found no difference in the expression or localization of occludin
and ZO1 (Fig. 3 E). We have also examined each bicellular TJ
protein in Lsr+/ and Lsr+/+ adult mouse brain tissue sections
and did not find any differences (unpublished data).
For a more precise analysis of the junctional complex architecture, we performed electron microscopy on Lsr/ and
Lsr+/+ E14.5 embryos. When focusing on EC adhesions, we observed TJs with kissing points in both Lsr/ and Lsr+/+ embryos
with no discernable structural difference (Fig. 3 G). Therefore,
removing LSR from the junctional complex doesn’t disrupt the
ultrastructure of the TJs. This is similar with the electron microscopy data from the study by Nitta et al. (2003), where they
described no ultrastructural differences between the CNS EC
TJs in Cldn5 knockout mice and their wild-type littermates.
Thus, changes in BBB permeability can occur without changes
to the ultrastructure of the junction.

have observed that wild-type embryos have leakage to small
molecules for the first few days after cerebral angiogenesis,
and that this barrier seals by E14.5; however, this barrier does
not seal in Lsr-deficient embryos. This reveals an important
role of LSR in proper BBB function and formation. In experimental models with a disrupted BBB, such as EAE and
MCAO, LSR is down-regulated in leaky blood vessels. These
results demonstrate that LSR is a BBB-enriched TJ protein
that is necessary for proper BBB formation, and it is downregulated during pathological BBB leakage associated with

neurological disorders. Collectively, these data suggest that
the expression of tricellular TJ proteins by CNS ECs may be a
key determinant in the formation of a high-resistance paracellular barrier.

Secondary Alexa Fluor–conjugated antibodies and fluorophore-conjugated
streptavidin were all purchased from Life Technologies.
Mice
Lsr+/ mice were generated in the laboratory of F.T. Yen (Unité de Recherche
Animal & Fonctionnalités des Produits Animaux laboratory, BFLA team,
Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy, France; Yen et al., 2008). In brief, a replacing vector that suppresses exons 2–5 of the Lsr gene was electroporated into 123/
Ola ES cells. Targeted ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and
implanted into C57BL/6 females. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The
Jackson Laboratory. All experimental procedures were performed according
to the University of California, San Francisco, and University of California,
San Diego, guidelines.

Immunohistochemistry
For staining of TJs proteins, embryos were frozen directly in OCT. For postnatal ages, mice were anesthetized with a ketamine (100 mg/kg) xylazine
(20 mg/kg) acepromazine cocktail. They were then perfused with PBS,
and their brains were dissected and frozen in OCT. 10-µm tissue sections
of embryos or postnatal brains were then cut with a cryostat (Leica). Sections were fixed in 95% ice-cold ethanol for 30 min followed by incubation
in acetone at room temperature for 1 min. Blocking was performed in 50%
goat serum for 45 min followed by staining with primary and secondary
antibodies. When indicated, fluorescein-conjugated lectin (BSL I-FL1101;
Vector Laboratories) was added to the secondary antibody mixture, in
which case tissue sections were postfixed for 10 min in 4% PFA after incubation with secondary antibodies.
For staining of endogenous proteins, adult mice were perfused with
PBS followed by 4% PFA. Their brains were dissected, cryopreserved in
30% sucrose, and frozen in a 2:1 solution of 30% sucrose/OCT. Embryos
were first injected with dyes (as described above) to study BBB permeability
and then submerged into 10% PFA for 2 h, cryopreserved in 30% sucrose,
and frozen in a 2:1 solution of 30% sucrose/OCT. 10-µm sections of embryos and postnatal brains were generated with a cryostat (Leica). Staining of PFA fixed tissue was performed as follows: rehydration for 5 min
in PBS, blocking/permeabilization in a 50% goat serum with 0.2% of
Triton-X100 for 45 min, followed by incubation with selected primary anti­
bodies diluted in PBS containing 5% goat serum overnight at 4°C. The
tissue sections were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in specific
secondary antibodies or fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin (for biotin labelling) solutions before being mounted in Vectashield with DAPI (H-1200;
Vector Laboratories).
Filipin staining was performed on 4% PFA fixed embryo sections. In
brief, sections were incubated in 125 µg/ml filipin diluted in 10% bovine
serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature in the dark before being
mounted in Vectashield without DAPI (H-1400; Vector Laboratories).
All experiments were visualized with a digital camera (Axiocam HRm;
Carl Zeiss) connected to a fluorescent microscope (Axio Imager D2; Carl
Zeiss). Objective lenses were: 5×, Fluor, 0.25 NA; 10×, Fluor, 0.50 NA;
20×, Plan-Apochromat, 0.8 NA; and 63×, oil, Plan-Apochromat, 1.4 NA
(all from Carl Zeiss). The acquisition software used was AxioVision (Carl
Zeiss), and the processing software used was Photoshop CS6 (Adobe).
Electron microscopy
For electron microscopy studies, we performed a Cesarean section of pregnant females, dissected embryos from yolk sacs, left them linked to their placenta, and placed them in room-temperature DPBS. Embryos were then
perfused with a 4% formaldehyde/4% glutaraldehyde mixture. Spines were

EAE
C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously injected with 200 µl of an emulsion of
Complete Freund’s adjuvant, MOG35-55 peptide, and inactivated mycobacterium tuberculosis (EK-2110; Hooke Laboratories). 2 h and 24 h afterwards, 200 ng of Pertussis toxin was injected i.p. (EK-2110; Hooke
Laboratories). At 4 d after onset of symptoms, mice were perfused with
DPBS, and their SCs were dissected and frozen in OCT. 10-µm sections
were generated. Staining for LSR, CD45, CD31, and endogenous mouse
IgG was performed as described in “Immunohistochemistry.”
MCAO
A transient MCAO was performed in young adult C57BL/6 mice as described previously (Kokubo et al., 2002). In brief, a monofilament suture
was inserted into the right external carotid artery. After 2 h of occlusion,
the suture was removed. After 24 h of reperfusion, mice were perfused
with DPBS followed by a solution of Sulfo-NHS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml), and
their brains were dissected and bisected coronally. Half of each brain was
fresh-frozen in OCT for LSR staining and the other half was postfixed for 2 h
in 4% PFA for biotin labeling, cryopreserved in 30% sucrose, and frozen in
a 2:1 solution of 30% sucrose/OCT. 10-µm sections were generated.
Quantifications
All quantifications were performed using Image J. To quantify leakage of
endogenous molecules, the intensity of 10 different regions outside of the
blood vessels was measured. The signal average was normalized to the
average signal for wild-type embryos. To quantify TJ protein expression,
the intensity of 10 different regions of blood vessels was measured for each
TJ protein. The signal average was normalized to the average signal for
wild-type embryos. To quantify leakage of biotin, the average signal intensity measured from 10 different regions outside of the blood vessels was
normalized to the average signal intensity measured from 10 different regions inside the blood vessels.

BBB permeability assays
For developmental BBB assessment, we performed a Cesarean section of
pregnant females, dissected embryos from yolk sacs, and without removing the placenta placed them in room-temperature Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS).
6 µl of 1.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-biotin (21217; Thermo Fisher Scientific) or
1.5 mg/ml tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated 10 kD dextran (D-1817; Life
Technologies) was injected in a timespan lasting 30 s into the hearts of
embryos with an automated syringe pump connected to a glass capillary
needle. After a 7-min incubation time, embryos were fixed in 10% PFA for
2 h, then submerged in 30% sucrose overnight before being embedded
in a 2:1 30% sucrose/OCT mixture. The heartbeat of all embryos was
monitored throughout the procedure up until fixation. If the heart stopped
beating before fixation, the embryos were euthanized and not used in the
analysis. 10-µm sections of embryos were generated and directly imaged
to visualize the injected dextran or stained with a fluorophore-conjugated
streptavidin (see “Immunohistochemistry”) to visualize the biotin. Images
were analyzed for biotin leakage (see “Quantifications”).

dissected, fixed in 4% tannic acid, stained in 2% OsO4 for 1 h followed by
2% uranyl acetate for 1 h, and finally dehydrated in ethanol and embedded
in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were cut and images were then acquired at
120 kV with a 1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL).
