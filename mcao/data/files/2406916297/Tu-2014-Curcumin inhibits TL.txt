Abstract—Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2/4) and the downstream nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)
signaling pathway, which mediate the inflammatory reaction in cerebral ischemia, were demonstrated to
be involved in the extension of cerebral infarction and the aggravation of ischemic brain damage. Reports showed that curcumin provides neuroprotection against ischemic brain damage. In this study, we
investigated whether curcumin inhibits the activation of TLR2/4-NF-κB signaling pathway in rats of
permanent focal cerebral ischemia. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). Curcumin was administered by intraperitoneal injection twice at 2 and
12 h after the onset of ischemia. Neurological deficit scores, cerebral infarct size, morphological characteristic, and cerebral water content were measured after 24 h of pMCAO. The enzymatic activity of
myeloperoxidase (MPO) was assessed after 24 h of pMCAO. Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in ischemic brain was determined by western blot. Expression of NF-κB p65 in ischemic brain was detected by
immunohistochemistry and western blot. The release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in blood was examined by ELISA. Curcumin significantly reduced neurological deficit
scores, cerebral infarct size, neuronal damage, cerebral water content, and MPO activity. It also inhibited
the expression of TLR2/4 and decreased the expression and activity of NF-κB p65 in rat brain. In addition, curcumin attenuated the release of TNF-α and IL-1β in blood. Our results suggest that curcumin
reduces inflammatory reaction and brain damage in a rat model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia.
The neuroprotective effect and anti-inflammatory property of curcumin in cerebral ischemia might be
associated with the inhibition of TLR2/4-NF-κB signaling pathway.

expression of inflammatory mediators have been demonstrated to exert a neuroprotection against ischemic brain
damage [3].
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a vital role in the
induction of inflammatory reaction and production of inflammatory mediators [4]. Recent reports showed that the
expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was upregulated after an
ischemic stroke, and the cerebral infarction and neurological deficit produced by cerebral ischemia were significantly less in mice deficient in TLR2 or TLR4 compared with
wild-type mice [5–7]. Activation of TLR2/4 generally
leads to nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor-kappaB
(NF-κB), a key regulator involved in the inducible expression of inflammatory mediators leading to inflammatory
reaction [8, 9]. The downstream inflammatory mediators of

Effect of Curcumin on TLR2/4-NF-κB Pathway and Brain Damage
TLR2/4-NF-κB include tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)
and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) that are the major mechanisms
by which post-inflammation contributes to ischemic brain
damage [10, 11].
Curcumin, a known antioxidant, has been demonstrated to attenuate lipid peroxidation and scavenge free
radicals effectively [12]. Several reports showed that
curcumin reduces ischemia-induced brain damage, which
might be attributed to its antioxidative property [13, 14].
However, whether curcumin inhibits the activation and
expression of TLR2/4-NF-κB signaling pathway in permanent focal cerebral ischemia remains unknown until now.
In the present study, we first explored whether curcumin
provides a neuroprotection against ischemic brain damage
after permanent focal cerebral ischemia and then further
investigated whether curcumin inhibits the activation and
expression of TLR2/4-NF-κB signaling pathway in cerebral ischemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and Animal Model
All animal experiments were conducted according to
the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats
weighing 250–300 g were obtained from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Animals were housed in a colony room under controlled
temperature (22 °C) and a 12:12 light-dark cycle, with food
and water available. Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg) and
subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) as described previously [15]. In brief, the right
common carotid artery (CCA), external carotid artery
(ECA), and internal carotid artery (ICA) were carefully
exposed. A nylon monofilament suture with a distal cylinder (0.32 mm in diameter) was inserted from the ECA into
the ICA and gently advanced to occlude the origin of the
right middle cerebral artery (MCA). The sham control rats
underwent the same surgery, except that the filament was
inserted only 10 mm and withdrawn a minute later. Rectal
temperature was maintained at 37.0 °C with a heating pad
and warm light during the surgical procedure.
Drug Administration and Experimental Groups
Curcumin (Sigma) was dissolved in normal saline and
intraperitoneally injected twice at 2 and 12 h after the onset
of ischemia. Rats were divided into four groups as follows:

1545

(i) sham operation group (n=18), which underwent sham
operation; (ii) MCAO + vehicle group (n=24), which was
subjected to MCAO and treated with vehicle; (iii) MCAO
+ curcumin 10 mg/kg group (n=18), which was subjected
to MCAO and treated with 10 mg/kg curcumin; and (iv)
MCAO + curcumin 50 mg/kg group (n=24), which was
subjected to MCAO and treated with 50 mg/kg curcumin.
Rats were treated with normal saline as the vehicle control
at the same volume and time point as curcumin.
Assessment of Neurological Deficit Scores
Neurological deficit was assessed at 24 h after
pMCAO according to a previous method described by
Bederson et al. [16], as follows: 0, no observable deficit;
1, contralateral forelimb flexion; 2, decreased resistance to
lateral push without circling; and 3, circling to the contralateral side.
Assessment of Cerebral Infarct Size
Rats were sacrificed under deep anesthesia, and the
brains were rapidly removed and coronally sliced into 2.0mm-thick sections. Brain slices were incubated in 2 %
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride for 20 min. The infarcted brain tissue appeared white, whereas the noninfarcted
region appeared red. The sections were digitized, and the
infarct areas were measured using Photoshop software by
tracing around the white area in each brain section.
Cerebral infarct size was calculated according to the following formula: V = t × (A1 +A2 +… An), where V is the
cerebral infarct size, t is the thickness of the slice, and A is
the infarct area. The degree of cerebral infarction was
expressed as a percent volume of the contralateral hemisphere. Correction for edema of infarct area was performed
as described by Lin et al. [17].
Histological Examination
After 24 h of MCAO, rats were perfused with 4 %
paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Then
brains were removed, fixed, and embedded in paraffin.
Coronal sections (4 μm thick) were obtained from embedded paraffin and deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated
with graded alcohol for Nissl staining and immunohistochemical analysis. To confirm the effect of curcumin on
neuronal damage produced by permanent focal cerebral
ischemia, Nissl staining (0.1 % toluidine blue) was performed to observe the morphological characteristic of neurons in ischemic brains.

Biochemical Analysis
The neutrophil infiltration was examined by measuring the enzymatic activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO). The
activity of MPO in rat brain was measured according to the
manufacturer’s instructions from the assay kit (Nanjing
Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China). The results
were expressed as unit per gram of tissue.
Assessment of Brain Edema
Rats were killed 24 h after cerebral ischemia, and the
brains were removed. The ischemic hemispheres were
gently blotted with filter paper and weighed on an electronic balance, as the wet weights (WW), and then dried to
constant weight to obtain the dry weights (DW). Cerebral
water content was calculated according to the following
formulation: H2O (%) = (WW − DW) / WW×100 %.
Immunohistochemical Analysis
For immunohistochemical analysis, the paraffinembedded sections were deparaffinized with xylene
and rehydrated with graded alcohol. Brain sections were
incubated in 3 % H2O2 for 15 min to block endogenous
peroxidase activity. Then, the sections were incubated
overnight at 4 °C with a mouse monoclonal antibody
against NF-κB p65 (1:50, Santa Cruz, USA). Biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Zhongshan Biotechnology
Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) was used as a secondary antibody. Diaminobenzidine was used as a color substrate.
PBS was applied instead of the primary antibody as a
negative control. The sections were visualized with a
microscope (Olympus, Japan).
Western Blot
Samples from ischemic brain were used for the experiments, and total protein was extracted using protein
extraction kit (Beyotime Biotech. Co., China) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein samples (50 μg)
were separated on 10 % SDS polyacrylamide gels, then
transferred to nitrocellulose (NC) membranes, and blocked
in 5 % nonfat dry milk buffer. The membranes were
incubated overnight at 4 °C with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against TLR2 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz, USA), or a rabbit
polyclonal antibody against TLR4 (1:1,000, Santa Cruz,
USA), or a mouse monoclonal antibody against NF-κB
p65 (1:200, Santa Cruz, USA), followed by incubation
with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000, Zhongshan Biotechnology Co. Ltd, Beijing, China). Protein expression was detected with an ECL

Tu, Yang, Chen, Chen, Ouyang, Xu, and Shi
detection system and exposed on an X-ray film. GAPDH
was used as a loading control. The optical densities of
protein bands on the X-ray film were quantitatively analyzed with Quantity one software.
ELISA Assay
After 24 h of MCAO, blood samples (1 ml) were
drawn from the femoral veins of rats. After centrifugation
at 3,000 rpm for 15 min, the supernatant was collected and
stored at −80 °C in a refrigerator. Serum contents of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) were measured
using rat TNF-α or IL-1β immunoassay enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Xiamen Tagene Biotechnology Co., Ltd. China).
Statistical Analysis
Experimental data were presented as mean ± SD.
Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed
by LSD test for individual comparisons between group
means. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS
Effect of Curcumin on Neurological Deficit, Cerebral
Infarction, and Neuronal Damage
Cerebral ischemia caused an obvious increase of
neurological deficit scores, cerebral infarct size, and
neuronal damage. Curcumin (both 10 and 50 mg/kg)
administration significantly reduced the neurological
deficit scores 24 h after MCAO (p<0.05 and p<0.01,
Fig. 1a), and it also significantly reduced cerebral infarct size 24 h after MCAO (p<0.01, Fig. 1b). Nissl
staining was performed to detect the effect of curcumin
on neuronal damage in rat brain. MCAO caused an
intense increase of neuronal damage (Fig. 1d) compared
with sham control (Fig. 1c), which was attenuated by 10
and 50 mg/kg curcumin (Fig. 1e, f). Sham-operated rats
did not have any neurological deficit, cerebral infarction, and neuronal damage.
Effect of Curcumin on Ischemic Brain Edema
The surface areas of the ischemic hemisphere in rat
brains (IS, Fig. 2a) were increased after 24 h of MCAO,
indicating ischemia-induced brain edema (Fig. 2a). Ischemic brain edema was determined by assessing the cerebral
water content of ischemic brain tissue. MCAO caused an

increase of cerebral water content in the ischemic hemisphere, which was significantly attenuated by curcumin
administration at 50 mg/kg (p<0.05, Fig. 2b).

Effect of Curcumin on Neutrophil Infiltration
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured for
quantitative indication of neutrophil infiltration in ischemic
brain tissue. Experimental results showed that the enzymatic activities of MPO were increased 24 h after MCAO
compared with sham operation, which was significantly
inhibited by curcumin administration at 10 and 50 mg/kg
(p<0.01, Fig. 3).

Effect of Curcumin on the NF-κB p65 Expression
and Activation
Immunohistochemical results showed that NF-κB
p65 immunoreactivity was little in sham-operated rat
(Fig. 5a), but obviously increased in ischemic brain tissue
24 h after MCAO (Fig. 5b). Curcumin (10 and 50 mg/kg)
administration obviously reduced the NF-κB p65immunopositive cells (Fig. 5c, d). Western blot analysis
showed an increased expression of NF-κB p65 in ischemic
brain tissue of MCAO rats compared with sham control,
which was significantly decreased by curcumin administration at 10 and 50 mg/kg (p<0.01, Fig. 5e, f).
Effect of Curcumin on the Release of TNF-α and IL-1β

Effect of Curcumin on the Expression of TLR2/4
Protein
Expression of TLR2 protein and TLR4 protein in
ischemic brain tissue was significantly increased 24 h after
MCAO compared with the sham operation group.
Curcumin (10 and 50 mg/kg) significantly downregulated
the expression of TLR2 protein (p<0.05 and p<0.01,
Fig. 4). Curcumin (50 but not 10 mg/kg) significantly
downregulated the expression of TLR4 protein (p<0.01,
Fig. 4).

Inflammatory cytokines in blood including TNF-α
and IL-1β were increased 24 h after MCAO compared
with sham control, both of which were significantly attenuated by curcumin administration at 10 and 50 mg/kg (p<
0.05 or p<0.01, Fig. 6).

disability. As we have known, the most important
pathological mechanisms in the process of ischemiainduced brain damage include inflammatory reaction,
BBB disruption, oxidative stress, and neuronal apoptosis, all of which have been widely considered to be
the four major therapeutic targets for acute ischemic
stroke until now.
Curcumin, a well-known antioxidant, has been demonstrated to attenuate lipid peroxidation and scavenge free
radicals [12]. Several reports showed that curcumin reduces ischemia-induced brain damage, which might be
attributed to its antioxidative property [13, 14]. Yang et

al. [18] demonstrated that curcumin upregulates the expression of antioxidative elements such as NF-E2-related
factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and protects
brains against focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Zhao et al.
[19] showed that curcumin improves neurological outcomes and reduces brain injury in rats of focal cerebral
ischemia by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis. Wang et al. [20]
demonstrated that curcumin ameliorates BBB permeability
by upregulating HO-1 expression in brain microvascular
endothelial cells following ischemic stroke. However,
whether curcumin inhibits ischemia-induced inflammatory
reaction remains unknown until now.

brain 24 h after pMCAO were determined by western blot (a), and the data were summarized in b. n=6, *p<0.05 and **p<0.01 vs. MCAO group.

The present study first showed that curcumin reduces
neurological deficit scores, cerebral infarct size, and neuronal damage in rats of permanent focal cerebral ischemia,
indicating curcumin’s neuroprotection against ischemic
brain damage. We also found that curcumin reduces cerebral water content in rats of permanent focal cerebral
ischemia, which demonstrated that curcumin attenuates
ischemic brain edema. Then, we found that curcumin
attenuates the enzymatic activities of MPO, demonstrating
the inhibitory effect of curcumin on ischemia-induced inflammatory reaction.
To further explore the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin’s anti-inflammatory property, for the first
time, we found that curcumin inhibits the expression of
TLR2/4 and decreases the expression and activity of NFκB p65 in rat brain. In addition, curcumin attenuates the
release of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) in
blood. The neuroprotective effect and anti-inflammatory
property of curcumin following an ischemic stroke might
be associated with the inhibition of TLR2/4-NF-κB signaling pathway.
TLR2/4-NF-κB signaling pathway, which initiates
the expression of proinflammatory mediators and induction of inflammatory reaction [21], leads to expansion of
cerebral infarction and aggravation of brain damage [22].
A previous study from our laboratory showed that the
mRNA and protein expression of TLR2 and TLR4 were

upregulated in rat brain after permanent focal cerebral
ischemia [8]. In addition, the upregulated expression of
TLR2/4 was temporally in parallel with the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 [8], indicating that TLR2/4-NF-κB
signaling pathway aggravates brain damage by mediating
the inflammatory reaction. TLR2/4-NF-κB signaling pathway might be a therapeutic target of inflammatory cascade
reaction in ischemic stroke. The present study showed that
curcumin downregulates the expression of TLR2/4 and
inhibits the expression and activity of NF-κB p65 after
permanent focal cerebral ischemia, which suggested that
curcumin attenuates inflammatory reaction possibly via
inhibiting TLR2/4-NF-κB signaling pathway.
Moreover, mice that lacked TLR2/4 had minor expression of ischemia-induced inflammatory cytokines implicated in brain damage following an experimental stroke
[5, 6], which demonstrated that TLR2/4 might be an upstream target of inflammatory cytokines. In the previous
study, we have shown that the release of TNF-α and IL-1β
in blood is elevated in rats of permanent focal cerebral
ischemia [8], which was significantly inhibited by baicalin
administration [23]. In the present study, we demonstrated
that curcumin also could decrease the release of TNF-α
and IL-1β after permanent focal cerebral ischemia. The
anti-inflammatory effect of curcumin may be associated
with the decrease of inflammatory mediators TNF-α and
IL-1β. In conclusion, curcumin inhibits TLR2/4-NF-κB
