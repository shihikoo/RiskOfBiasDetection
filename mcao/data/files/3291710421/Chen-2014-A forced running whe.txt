Abstract
We developed a forced non-electric-shock running wheel (FNESRW) system that provides rats with high-intensity exercise
training using automatic exercise training patterns that are controlled by a microcontroller. The proposed system successfully
makes a breakthrough in the traditional motorized running wheel to allow rats to perform high-intensity training and to enable
comparisons with the treadmill at the same exercise intensity without any electric shock. A polyvinyl chloride runway with a
rough rubber surface was coated on the periphery of the wheel so as to permit automatic acceleration training, and which
allowed the rats to run consistently at high speeds (30 m/min for 1 h). An animal ischemic stroke model was used to validate
the proposed system. FNESRW, treadmill, control, and sham groups were studied. The FNESRW and treadmill groups
underwent 3 weeks of endurance running training. After 3 weeks, the experiments of middle cerebral artery occlusion, the
modified neurological severity score (mNSS), an inclined plane test, and triphenyltetrazolium chloride were performed to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed platform. The proposed platform showed that enhancement of motor function,
mNSS, and infarct volumes was significantly stronger in the FNESRW group than the control group (P,0.05) and similar to the
treadmill group. The experimental data demonstrated that the proposed platform can be applied to test the benefit of exercisepreconditioning-induced neuroprotection using the animal stroke model. Additional advantages of the FNESRW system include
stand-alone capability, independence of subjective human adjustment, and ease of use.

Introduction
Regular exercise is considered to be beneficial for the
overall health of an organism in its normal and diseased
states (1-3). An increasing number of studies have shown
the beneficial effects of exercise on stroke-induced brain
injuries in animal models (4,5). The neuroprotective mechanisms of exercise in humans are the same as those in
animals; therefore, animal injury models are used to verify
the efficacy of exercise in humans (6-9). Rats are often used
in these experiments. Six weeks of free-running wheel
exercise enhances the survival of neural progenitor cells
after a hemorrhagic stroke (6), and pretraining exercises on a
free-running wheel for 7 weeks can stimulate neurogenesis
in damaged neuronal cells (7). Additionally, 2 or 4 weeks of

pretraining exercise on a treadmill reduces brain damage
after ischemic stroke (8). Research has shown an exercise
preconditioning benefit on neurological deficits and the infarct
volume in rats that exercised on a treadmill at 15 m/min for
30 min/day for 3 weeks and were then subjected to transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) (9). However, more
animal experiments used 20-30 m/min as exercise preconditioning for the prevention of stroke than low-intensity
training (15 m/min) (4,10-13). These findings suggest that
exercise preconditioning can produce neuroprotection from
ischemic stroke and that this protection is manifested during
reperfusion. In this study, an animal ischemic stroke model
was triggered to validate the proposed system.

A forced running wheel provides high-intensity exercise

Animal locomotion platforms can be classified into
voluntary running wheel and forced treadmill groups (14).
The treadmill uses electric shock to force rats to run,
whereas the running wheel allows voluntary running.
Voluntary running is used to simulate daily human activities
(1). In contrast, rats on a treadmill are forced to move for
0.5-1 h for 5-7 days per week, which simulates an athlete
performing long-term exercise in a gym (15). Clinical
anatomical experiments have found that these two types of
exercise can enhance and maintain the energizing brain
glucose transporter (GLUT-1 and GLUT-3) (16). Forced
and voluntary exercise differentially affect neurophysiological performance (17,18). Forced exercise effectively
induces neuroprotection in stroke, but this is not the
case with voluntary exercise (17). However, the voluntary
activity leads to more prominent plastic changes in the
hippocampal formation of rats than the forced exercise
(18). The ability to control and maintain a high training
intensity (.20 m/min) is a major advantage of a treadmill.
The disadvantages of a voluntary running wheel include a
substantially lower intensity of exercise and more variation
in the amount of exercise that each animal receives.
However, two methods interfere with the experimental
results from forced treadmills: 1) aversive electric shocks
to force exercise training, and 2) manually adjusting the
speed of the exercise training at the beginning of the
exercise and during the training stage. In the anatomical
experimental data, when training with electric shocks, it is
difficult to distinguish whether psychological stress or
exercise training induces a physiological phenomenon. In
addition, psychological stress may have negative effects,
including adrenal hypertrophy, splenic atrophy, and
increased circulating corticosterone (9,17,19). These extra
physiological responses interfere with the experimental
results. Therefore, this study proposes a forced nonelectric-shock running wheel (FNESRW) exercise platform
to train animals maintaining high-intensive training and to
minimize the influence of psychological stress. Moreover,
an automated exercise-training model is included to
accurately control the amount of exercise activity and to
reduce the disadvantages of manual training on treadmills.
Motorized running wheels (MRWs) are commercially
available for researchers (20-22). However, Leasure and
Jones (20) found that rats were reluctant to run at speeds
higher than 20 m/min on the currently available MRWs.
These MRWs are currently used in research for low-speed
running (20-23), and the lack of smooth automation training
patterns allows rats to fall and become injured during highintensity training. High-intensity exercise training (.20 m/
min) triggers effective neurophysiological protection and
recovery in a more effective and faster manner than
low-intensity training for some clinical end-points (24-27).
Therefore, this study sought to overcome the difficulties of
high-intensity exercise training on a traditional MRW and
excluded the interference effects of the treadmill with electric
shock that is applied to an animal model. We developed an

automatic and progressive exercise training pattern
that spans from preparatory training to official exercise
running, prevents injuries, and removes the disadvantages
of a human operator. Moreover, a polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
runway with a rough rubber surface was coated onto the
periphery of the wheel to allow the rats to run smoothly and
consistently at high speeds (30 m/min for 1 h). The firmware
of the system can be easily modified to suit movement
patterns for other applications. We describe a fully functional
prototype of the system and its implementation. The results
of this study show that the infarction volume can be reduced
through preconditioning exercise with the proposed
platform.

Material and Methods
The proposed FNESRW with an automatic training
function can train animals to perform high-intensity running
while avoiding the use of electric shocks, which allows
the impact of exercise on the infarct volume in cerebral
ischemic stroke to be verified without interference. The
animals used in the experiment were randomly assigned
to four groups (FNESRW, treadmill, sham, and control).
Only the FNESRW and treadmill groups followed a 3-week
exercise training program (Figure 1). Exercise speed
training data from the 3-day preparatory training were
acquired using the manual mode of the proposed running
wheel exercise platform, which was used to construct a
complete set of automatic exercise training models for
the subsequent 3 weeks of exercise. After the 3 weeks
of exercise, a stroke was induced in the FNESRW,
treadmill, and control animals with 60 min of MCAo, which
was followed by 7-day reperfusion using an intraluminal
filament. The same surgery was performed for the sham
group but without triggering blocked arteries. To evaluate
the damage and recovery from the stroke, an inclined plane
device test (28) and the modified neurological severity
score (mNSS) (29) were used to evaluate neurological
damage for the next 7 days. Finally, the animals were killed

by exposure to triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) to
assess infarct volume.
FNESRW
The proposed microcontroller-based FNESRW system
facilitates exercise preconditioning for small laboratory
animals such as rats. The FNESRW system consists of
four parts: 1) a roller platform coated with a PVC runway –
the sides of the center axis of the wheel are welded to the
triangular metal framework to support the commercially
available roller that is constructed of metal bars, and the
bearing is embedded in the center of the wheel to enable
free rotation and create a voluntary running wheel configuration; 2) a high-torque, brushless direct current (DC)
motor, which drives the roller – a hexagonal screw latches to
a gear into the central axis of the motor and wheel, and the
gears on the motor and the wheel are the same size, and
these two gears are mutually engaged and can be removed
(Figure 2) to create a forced running wheel configuration; 3)
a flexible microcontroller is used to precisely control the
motor speed by using pulse-width modulation (PWM) for the
automatic progressive training function; and 4) a conventional computer with a parallel port is used to connect the
system to a computer, which writes and loads the firmware
that is used in the microcontroller and controls the speed of
the FNESRW system.
A photograph of the lab-built apparatus is shown in
Figure 3. The running platform has a wheel that is 35 cm
in diameter and 15 cm wide, and the height from the
triangle bracket to the bottom of the wheel is 20 cm. The
outer ring of the wheel is coated with a PVC runway with a

rough surface, which is tightly fixed to the outside of the
wheel frame with strong Velcro tape, making it removable.
Most rats fail to run up and do not fully step on the bars at
20 m/min on the running wheel without the PVC runway
(the structure of the commercially available running
wheel). This design is effective for overcoming the highintensity training restrictions of commercially available
MRWs, thus allowing rats to run relatively stably and
preventing injuries at high speeds (20 m/min or more).
Eleven sensing plates were placed on the wheel rim to
detect rotation speed (Figure 3).
The speed of the FNESRW is controlled by a DC motor
and its driver. The system can be switched between manual
and automatic modes using a jumper switch. The manual
mode employs a variable resistor to produce various
voltages and the control speed, whereas the automatic
mode is controlled by the microcontroller firmware with
PWM. Six automatic training speed patterns exist: three for
preparatory training and three for formal training.
A block diagram of the control unit hardware is shown in
Figure 4. The control unit consists of a microcontroller, a
liquid-crystal display (LCD), a touch-button keypad, an insystem programing interface, a velocity monitor, a velocity
control, a jumper switch, and a power supply (a brief
description of each component is provided below).
Microcontroller. The system is based on an AT89S52
microcontroller (ATMEL Corp., USA) that provides a highly
flexible and cost-effective solution for embedded control
applications. The AT89S52 includes four programmable
ports, two external interrupt sources, three timers or counters, one programmable serial USART, 8 kB of program

motor driver (BLED12A, Oriental Motor, Japan), and a DC
motor (BLEM512-GFS, Oriental Motor). The motor torque
was 8.6 N?m, and it effectively drove the running wheel
platform (approximately 1 kg) in addition to the weight of
an experimental rat (250 to 350 g) with a sufficient margin
for an instant reaction to the force that was created by a
running rat. The pulse signal of the microcontroller
generated a specific voltage through the bridge IC, which
was used to control the motor driver. The bridge IC was a
full-bridge driver that converted the logic input signal into an
analog signal.
Power supply. A conventional linear power supply
provided regulated DC voltage (+
+5 V) for all components
of the system, except for the DC motor driver and DC motor,
which were directly powered from the main city power.

memory, and 256 B of RAM for data.
Display. A conventional LCD with 2610 characters
shows the rotation speed of the proposed running wheel
to the local user. The driver and built-in backlight are
included with this off-the-shelf LCD module.
Keypad. A 464 button switch is used for the user
interface. The six buttons were assigned three commands
each for preparatory and formal trainings. Therefore, the
user can input commands that trigger the automatic
training pattern. These instructions can also be input
using the keyboard of an attached PC.
Velocity monitor. The rotation of the proposed running
wheel was detected using 11 sensing plates and a
transmissive optical sensor (TCRT2103, Vishay
Semiconductors, USA). A velocity-monitoring circuit was
designed to process the received signals, which were sent
to the microcontroller for speed calculation before display.
Velocity control. The speed control was set to manual
or automatic mode using a jumper switch. The automatic
mode provided a consistent and precise procedure for
training rats and eliminated the human factor. The manual
mode allowed the training to be dynamically controlled by
a variable resistor (potentiometer). The automatic mode
contained six training models that were triggered by the
six buttons. The velocity control function of automatic
training was achieved using a microcontroller (AT89S52), a
bridge integrated circuit (IC; TA7257P, Toshiba, Japan), a

Automatic training model construction
The progressive training model was constructed to
allow the rats to run steadily and continuously at 30 m/min
for 1 h. Because of the curved structure of the running
wheel, it was more difficult for the rats to be trained to run
quickly and smoothly at high speeds (20 m/min or more)
compared with training on a traditional treadmill. When
accelerating, rats could easily fall and become injured.
Some rats could jump from high to low positions, and such
running behavior was relatively more labor saving than the
linear motion of the treadmill. Therefore, an automatic
progressive exercise-training model was designed to
enable the animals to smoothly accelerate from 0 to
30 m/min and prevent the skipping of parts of the exercise
on rollers. The acceleration curve was systematically
established and repeated daily to remove human error. In
this study, a manual, progressive training method was used
to train the rats to reach and maintain 20 m/min within 3
days. Animal movement experiments usually use a
preparatory training period of 3 days to allow the rats to
adapt and learn the 20 m/min running training (4,10,30).
The rats are injured easily when running at speeds of
20 m/min without the adaptive learning stage. Nine rats
were used in the experiments to construct training patterns
for 3 days (30 min/day) using the manual mode. The training data of the velocity for various times are shown in Table 1.

Figure 5. Construction of the three exponential exercise
acceleration training model.

Automatic animal training patterns were constructed for
rats without prior running wheel experience, and they
learned to run at 20 m/min (a medium-intensity exercise)
within 3 days. Progressive acceleration was used to train
the rats. The speed was temporarily reduced when a rat
fell, and was raised when a rat ran steadily. The training
speed was steadily increased, until the maximum speed
that the rat could maintain while running smoothly was
determined. On Day 1, the average maximum speed was
approximately 13 m/min. The acceleration slope was
gradually raised on Day 2, and it was increasingly
accelerated on Day 3 to achieve the desired maximum
average speed of approximately 20 m/min. The rats
reached higher speeds more quickly as they familiarized
themselves with the running wheel. The daily maximum
steady velocity showed an upward trend.
The accelerative curve showed a similar exponential
distribution for the actual experimental training velocity
data. Therefore, in this study, an exponential exercise
acceleration training curve for 3 days was constructed
(Figure 5), where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is the
corresponding controlled velocity. The velocity at time t is


velocity ðtÞ~A| 1{e{t=t zB
(1)
where A and B are constants and t is the time constant.
After fitting the experimental data for the first day into the
training model, A was set to 5 and B was set to 8. The
acceleration slope of the velocity was obtained by
changing the time constant t. Parameter construction of
the training model for the other days followed the same
method. The maximum training speed of the second week
in the study was increased to 30 m/min based on the
exponential accelerative training model. The microcontroller firmware was programmed to change the output of
PWM and to control the speed of the DC motor through
the bridge IC.
Software
Speed control and speed detection software were
developed for the FNESRW system. First, the speed control
software facilitated accurate and smooth acceleration

control during the initial 3 days of preparatory training and
3 weeks of formal training. The goal of the 3-day preparatory
training was to familiarize the rats with the roller and
condition them to run smoothly at 20 m/min. The manual
training data were analyzed to extract the speed-controllable
parameters for an automated exponential training speed
curve by PWM control. Second, speed detection software
facilitated the recording of distance information using the
microcontroller external interrupt (external INT0) service
routine. The external INT0 was triggered using the
transmissive optical sensor to import data from the 11
sensing plates. Instantaneous speed was derived by
dividing by the time and was displayed on the LCD.
The microcontroller firmware was written in the C
programming language and included the main program,
two timer-interrupt service routines, and one externalinterrupt service routine. The main program consisted of a
loop that calculated and displayed the training speed
(Figure S1). The global variable ‘‘Num_Sensing’’ was the
sensed number of the transmissive optical sensors;
Num_Sensing was incremented as one unit per 10-cm
rotation, and the global variable ‘‘Time_0’’ was a second
counter. Therefore, rotational speed was obtained as
speed=Num_Sensing610/Time_0. The speed was displayed on the LCD, and the main program awaited
commands from the local keypad. Commands A through
C were the preparatory training speed curves for the first,
second, and third days, respectively. After IN0, Timer 0,
and Timer 1 were enabled, a speed table of the training
curve for the first to third days was created based on
Equation 1. A PWM value was generated every 10 s
according to the table that was created during the training
period. Commands D through F corresponded to the first,
second, and third weeks of the formal training curve, with
maximum speeds and durations of 20 m/min for 30 min,
30 m/min for 30 min, and 30 m/min for 60 min, respectively. Two timer-interrupt service routines were used:
Timer 0 and Timer 1 (Figure S2A and B, respectively).
Timer 0 was used to calculate the time (in seconds) of
a wheel rotation. Timer 1 was used to generate the
corresponding PWM value for the time unit, which was
used to update the PWM value every 10 s until the end of
the exercise (Exer_Time).
One external-interrupt service routine, INT0, was in
edge-trigger mode for the transmissive sensing signal
during wheel rotation (Figure S2C). The interrupt signal
was triggered by the sensing action of the transmissive
optical sensor, the interval between the figure sensing
plates was 10 cm, and running distance information was
recorded there.
Calibration
A working prototype was implemented for the purpose
of this study. First, the rotation speed was calibrated, and
an accurate reference speed was measured using a
speedometer (OXP-2A, Oriental Motor) and compared to

a week for 3 weeks (running for 30 min at 20 m/min, 30 min
at 30 m/min, and 60 min at 30 m/min at 1, 2, and 3 weeks
of training, respectively). The work rate of the rats on
this training protocol was approximately 70-75% of their
maximal oxygen consumption (31), and the ambient
temperature was controlled at 25±16C. Body weight and
rectal temperature of the rats were recorded before and
after running. The animals in the control and sham groups
did not receive exercise training, but were allowed to run
freely in their cages for 3 weeks.

the speed monitor module for verification (the speedometer
is shown in Figure 6). The manual and automatic modes of
the proposed system were used to verify the speed of
rotation and to compare the deviation between the
speedometer and the speed monitor module. Manual
mode was verified by randomly setting the speed and
comparing the speedometer value to that of the speed
monitor module. To verify automatic mode, one of the six
keys on the keypad was pressed, and the speed value of
the speedometer was compared to that of the speed
monitor module. The speedometer data were accessed
using the microcontroller through the speed-out connection
port of the motor driver (BLED12A, Oriental Motor), which
generated 600 pulse signals per cycle. The resulting errors
were in the range of ±0.1 m/min.
Experimental animals
Adult male Wistar rats (average weight 228±22 g)
were obtained from BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd (Taiwan).
The animals were housed in groups of four at an ambient
temperature of 21±16C, with a 12:12-h light-dark cycle.
Pellet rat chow and tap water were available ad libitum. All
protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of
the Chi-Mei Medical Center (Tainan, Taiwan) in accordance
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
of the National Institutes of Health (USA) and the Guidelines
of the Animal Welfare Act.
Exercise training protocol
Animals were randomly assigned to the FNESRW
(n=9), treadmill (n=9), control (n=9), or sham (n=9)
groups. The animals in the preconditioning exercise group
were placed on the FNESRW and treadmill (Exer-6M
Treadmill, Columbus Instruments, USA) for a 3-day
preparatory training to reach the required, basic efficient
exercise intensity of 20 m/min for 30 min. The animals were
then subjected to official endurance running training 5 days

www.bjournal.com.br

MCAo
An MCAo was induced in exercised and nonexercised
animals after 3 weeks according to the stroke model.
Animals were anesthetized and maintained with 1%-3%
halothane in 70% N2O and 30% O2 with a face mask. The
rectal temperature (colon temperature) was monitored
throughout the surgical procedure and maintained at
36.5±0.56C using a circulating heating pad. MCAo was
induced with an intraluminal filament model (32) and
maintained for 60 min. In brief, the left common carotid,
internal carotid artery (ICA), and external carotid artery
(ECA) were exposed by surgical operation. A filament (a
4-0 nylon suture with a blunted tip, 0.37 mm in diameter;
Doccol Corporation, USA) that was coated with poly-Llysine was inserted into the right ECA. Next, the direction of
the suture was altered toward the ICA and gently advanced
to occlude the MCAo. Reperfusion was established by
withdrawal of the filament under anesthesia at the end of
Day 7. The reliability and effectiveness of this model to
induce stroke was guaranteed using poly-L-lysine-coated
intraluminal sutures, which yielded consistently large
infarcts and greatly reduced variation in the results
between different animals (33). Rats in the sham group
underwent the same ECA and ICA procedures without the
MCAo.
mNSS
The mNSS was used to measure various aspects of
neurological function. The mNSS test is a composite of
motor (muscle status and abnormal movement), sensory
(visual, tactile, and proprioceptive), reflex (pinna, corneal,
and startle), and balance tests (29). Neurological function
is graded on a scale of 0 to 18 (normal and healthy score:
0; maximum deficit score: 18), where one point counts for
the inability to perform the test or for the lack of a tested
reflex; thus, a higher score represents more severe injury.
All rats were able to perform the tests every day for 7 days
after surgery.
Inclined plane test
The grab performance of all rats was evaluated using
an inclined plane device that was developed in our
laboratory (28), on each of the 7 days after surgery. The
inclined plane test is a quantitative, objective, and sensitive
method for evaluating motor deficits after cerebral ischemia

in rats. It assesses the ability of the rat to prevent itself from
falling over and determines the endurance strength in the
upper and lower limbs. The sliding apparatus had a
60660 cm acrylic surface that could be inclined from 06
(horizontal) to 706. The floor of the enclosure was covered
with hook-side Velcro fabric, which provided a secure
surface for the rat to grab and hold. Each rat was initially
placed on a 256 inclined plane in the area of the hook-side
Velcro fabric. The lower limbs were allowed to clutch the
Velcro, and the upper limbs remained on the acrylic
surface. The angle of the inclined plane was then raised
until the lower limbs detached from the Velcro and the rat
slid down. Once this occurred, the increase of the plane
angle was stopped, and the angle was recorded. The
inclined plane test was conducted for each rat once a day
for 7 days.
TTC staining and quantitative analysis of infarct
volume
After 7 days of behavioral evaluation, the infarct volume
was analyzed. The rats were deeply anesthetized with
urethane (500 mg/mL, ip), and the brains were carefully
removed and dissected into coronal, 1-mm sections using
a vibratome. The fresh brain slices were immersed in a
2% solution of 2-, 3-, and 5-TTC in normal saline at 376C
for 30 min. The total infarct area was multiplied by the
thickness of the brain sections to obtain the infarct volume.
The areas of noninfarcted tissue ipsilateral and contralateral to the occluded side were measured using a scanner
and an image analysis system (34). The noninfarcted area
in the ipsilateral hemisphere was subtracted from that in
the contralateral hemisphere, and the infarct volume was
calculated using the following formula: corrected percentage of infarct volume=(contralateral hemispheric volume
minus ipsilateral noninfarcted volume)/contralateral hemispheric volume (35).
Statistical analysis
Data are reported as means±SE. Based on the
underlying assumption that the test data of each group
satisfy Gaussian distribution, a parametric analysis was
applied to compare the differences among the groups.
Comparisons between the various groups were evaluated using a one-way analysis of variance, followed by
the Fisher least-significant difference post hoc test.
Pairwise comparison was performed using the Student
t-test in the case of heterogeneity of variance of data.
Data were analyzed using the Sigma Plot Software
(USA), and, in all cases, statistical significance was set at
P,0.05.

Scores of the sham group that were obtained before and

results indicated that forced exercise preconditioning on

the FNESRW was effective for stroke prevention. Although
average scores for the treadmill were lower than those for
the FNESRW, no significant difference was observed.
Scores for the sham group were significantly lower than
those for the FNESRW and treadmill groups (Figure 7B;
P,0.05), which indicated the similar efficacy of nerve
damage recovery over 7 days between the treadmill and
FNESRW groups.
Motor function
Figure 8 shows the results of the motor performance
of a lower limb grip that was measured using the inclined
plane test for 7 days after surgery. Figure 8A shows the
average inclined plane angle of the lower limb grip on
each day for the four groups (sham, control, treadmill, and
FNESRW), and Figure 8B shows the average angle that
was obtained from the lower limb grip test for each group
over 7 days (means±SD). The inclined plane angle of the
control group was the lowest and significantly lower than
that of the sham group on each of the 7 days (Figure 8A
and B; P,0.05). Although no significant difference
between the inclined plane angles of the FNESRW and
treadmill groups was observed (Figure 8B), the FNESRW
group had significantly higher 7-day inclined plane angles
than those of the control group (Figure 8B; P,0.05). More
specifically, the increased trend of inclined angles on each
day for the FNESRW group was more obvious than that
for the control group (Figure 8A), indicating that the
recovery of motor function in the FNESRW group was
faster than that in the control group.
Infarct volume (TTC)
The extent of the infarct lesions was examined using
TTC staining (36). This method stains the normal parts of
the brain red. The cerebral infarct regions in the brains of
the MCAo model rats remained white after staining, and
this reduced amount of staining clearly delineated the
areas of infarction (Figure 9A). The experimental results
show that the infarct size of the control group
(291±20 mm3, P,0.05) was significantly higher than that
of the sham group after 7 days of reperfusion (Figure 9B).
Infarct sizes of the treadmill (42±88 mm3, P,0.05) and
FNESRW (104±22 mm3, P,0.05) groups were significantly lower than that of the control group (Figure 9B),
indicating that endurance exercise training (either on a
treadmill or FNESRW) can effectively reduce the infarct
volume. There was no statistical difference between the
treadmill and FNESRW groups in infarct area, indicating
the similar benefit of exercise preconditioning in the animal
ischemic stroke model.

Discussion
In this study, we developed an FNESRW platform with
automatic exercise training patterns to force rats to run in
high-intensive training, and the ischemic stroke model for

rats was used to verify the benefit of exercise training on
the proposed system. During training, it was difficult for
rats to exercise at 20 m/min, which is the required basic
speed for effective exercise intensity (30), on the
proposed platform without a rubber belt (the structure of
the commercially available running wheel). Rats were
forced to run at 20 m/min or more on the structure of the
MRW runway in our experiments, and the rats would
clutch a cross bar and fall down, which induced injury,

which is also a problem for commercially available MRWs
(20). Two possible reasons exist for this occurrence. First,
compared with the flat plane trajectory of a treadmill, the
curved trajectory of a running wheel makes running more
difficult and complex. Second, unlike the treadmill track
belt, which rats can step onto easily and smoothly, gaps
are present between the bars of the running wheel, which
force the rats to run along the beams. To facilitate steady
running at higher wheel speeds, a layer of PVC runway was
coated onto the outside of the running wheel to prevent injury
and improve running stability. This structure allowed the
rats to perform steady, high-intensity training at 30 m/min
for 1 h. Moreover, we automated the progressive exercisetraining model by gradually accelerating the training
patterns to precisely and smoothly accelerate from 0 to
30 m/min, thus preventing the rats from falling and
becoming injured.
The experimental results of the motor function (inclined
plane test), mNSS values, and infarct volume for the
FNESRW group were significantly stronger (Figures 7-9;
P,0.05) compared with those of the control group and

were similar to the treadmill group, which indicated that
the FNESRW provided effective exercise training. Many
animal neurophysiological studies have confirmed that the
benefit of a forced treadmill is significantly higher than that
of a voluntary running wheel, regardless of the intrinsic
neuroprotection (16,17,37) or strengthening of the muscles
(38). The experimental data obtained in the present study
indicated that the FNESRW platform could achieve
benefits similar to those obtained with a treadmill, but
without using electric shock. Therefore, the proposed
FNESRW platform can be used as an alternative system
in clinical animal studies. The overall effect of the proposed
platform was close to the treadmill group. Furthermore,
recovery of hindlimbs after training on the proposed
FNESRW was more rapid than for the control group.
Most of the time, the running posture of the rats on the
proposed platform involved the hindlimbs being higher than
the forelimbs. Therefore, we believe that this running
posture causes the hindlimbs of the rats to undergo heavier
load training.
The advantage of the proposed system is the lack of
interference from electric shocks and the stable training
pace at high-intensity speeds. The protection against
ischemic stroke that is provided by a treadmill is partly
from the use of electrical stimuli (17). However, animals
may exhibit a stress response to such stimuli, and this
should be acknowledged in forced treadmill studies.
Some studies have shown evidence of systemic stress,
which may lead to adrenal hypertrophy, splenic atrophy,
and increased circulating corticosterone, especially in
male animals (18,39). Therefore, any results that are
obtained in studies using treadmills may not be completely caused by the exercise; instead, they may be partially
caused by psychological stress. To exclude the interference of the electrical stimulus, this study proposed and
implemented a wheel that does not use electric shock but
provides the same benefits as a traditional treadmill in
clinical trials.
The benefit of the variable speed movement patterntriggered neuroprotective factor against stroke is another
relevant topic. Most animal experiments in the literature
maintained 20 m/min to 30 m/min on a treadmill for
30-60 min. The results showed that achieving 75% of
maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) enhanced neuroprotective factors, but it was unclear whether less than 60%
of VO2max exercise also increased neuroprotective
factors (40). Another advantage of the proposed system
is that the number of revolutions and the revolution time of
the wheel can be programmed. Therefore, the FNESRW
exercise platform can be used to evaluate the neuroprotective benefit of running at various intensities and
durations.
This study implemented an FNESRW system, which
effectively trains rats in an automated mode for exercise
preconditioning, thereby significantly reducing infarct
volume after ischemic stroke. Unlike a traditional treadmill,

www.bjournal.com.br

A forced running wheel provides high-intensity exercise

the proposed platform forces a rat to continue highintensity running without using electric shock, resulting in
experiments with less interference. Automated progressive
training patterns were constructed to facilitate smooth
running at high intensity. Moreover, in cooperation with
automatic acceleration training patterns, the PVC runway wheel allows rats to run more steadily during highintensity training. The experimental data showed that the
proposed FNESRW system for exercise preconditioning
successfully provided a neuroprotective benefit of exercise for rats.
