Hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning (HBO-PC) has been demonstrated to attenuate hemorrhagic transformation
(HT) after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in hyperglycemic rats. However, the mechanisms remain to
be illustrated. Recently, HBO-PC has been shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma
(PPARγ) by increasing 15d-PGJ2 in primary cultured neurons. We hypothesize that HBO-PC reduces HT by
suppressing inﬂammation through increasing 15d-PGJ2 and activating PPARγ in hyperglycemic MCAO rats.
HBO (2.5 ATA) was administered for 1 h daily for 5 consecutive days. The PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 was
administered intraperitoneally to designated animals. Infarction volume, hemorrhage volume, neurological
scores and mortality were analyzed. The levels of 15d-PGJ2, PPARγ, TNF-α and IL-1β, tight junction proteins as
well as the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were evaluated 24 h after MCAO. HBO-PC reduced HT, improved
neurological function, down-regulated inﬂammatory molecules and inhibited the activation of MMP-9 by
increasing 15d-PGJ2 and PPARγ at 24 h after MCAO. The results suggested that HBO-PC might be an alternative
measure to decrease HT in ischemic stroke.

Introduction
Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is one of the major side effects of
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment and occurs in 5% to 10% of
stroke patients (Donnan et al., 2011). Emerging data show that preischemic hyperglycemia dramatically aggravated brain infarct and HT
in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model (Cipolla and
Godfrey, 2010; Paciaroni et al., 2009; Xing et al., 2011). The development of HT in hyperglycemic rats may be associated with increased
oxidative stress and inﬂammatory activity (Fabian and Kent, 2012),
which causes blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption (Chiu et al., 2013;
Paciaroni et al., 2009; Fagan et al., 2013). Preventing inﬂammation and
stabilizing BBB against breakdown may reduce tPA side effects and
improve patient outcomes (Hafez et al., 2014).
Preconditioning has been reported to be a promising therapeutic
strategy against the ischemia/reperfusion injury in experiment animals
(Dezfulian et al., 2013; Koch, 2013). Previously we have demonstrated
that hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning (HBO-PC) strongly suppressed

HT and improved neurological deﬁcits in hyperglycemic MCAO rats
(Soejima et al., 2012, 2013); however, the mechanisms remain to be
illustrated. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) is a
member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, and plays a
central role in the regulation of apoptosis (Chang and Szabo, 2000),
oxidative stress and inﬂammation (Lehrke and Lazar, 2005) as well as affords signiﬁcant neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion
injury (Wu et al., 2009). 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2)
is an endogenous ligand with a high afﬁnity for PPARγ. Activation of
PPARγ has been reported to preserve the integrity of the BBB in type 2
diabetic mice (Min et al., 2012). Recently, Zeng and his colleagues
found that HBO-PC signiﬁcantly increased the levels of 15d-PGJ2,
PPARγ mRNA and protein in primary cultured cortical neurons with
OGD exposure (Zeng et al., 2012). Therefore, in the present study, we
will investigate whether HBO-PC attenuates hyperglycemia-induced
HT in MCAO rats and protects BBB through increasing 15d-PGJ2 and
activating PPARγ signal pathway.

This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals of the National Institutes of Health. All protocols were

on the level of 15d-PGJ2 in naïve rats.

Animal groups and interventions
Hyperglycemia induction and MCAO
Two hundred and eighty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were
purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). HBO at 2.5 ATA
was administered for 1 hour daily for 5 consecutive days. 50% dextrose
(DX, 6 ml/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before MCAO
to induce acute hyperglycemia. PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 was
administered intraperitoneally to designated animals for intervention.
Animals were divided into six groups: DX + Sham (n = 20),
DX + MCAO (n = 54), DX + HBO + MCAO (n = 50),
DX + NBO + MCAO (n = 50), DX + HBO + MCAO + GW9662 (n =
50), and DX + HBO + MCAO + DMSO (n = 48). Infarction volume,
hemorrhage volume, neurological scores and mortality were measured
for outcome study. The protein level of PPARγ, TNF-α and IL-1β, as well
as the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were evaluated at 24 h after
MCAO. Two additional groups of animals (Naïve and Naïve + HBO-PC,

All rats received 50% dextrose (6 ml/kg) intraperitoneally 30 min before MCAO to induce acute hyperglycemia. Anesthesia was induced
with ketamine and xylazine (80 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg respectively,
intraperitoneally), followed by atropine at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg
subcutaneously. During the surgery and postoperative period, rectal
temperature was maintained at 37.0 °C by using a feedback-controlled
heating pad. MCAO was performed as previously reported (Hu et al.,
2011). Brieﬂy, the right external carotid artery was isolated and
coagulated. A 4-0 nylon suture with a round tip was inserted into the
internal carotid artery through the external carotid artery stump and
advanced to occlude the origin of middle cerebral artery. The suture
was removed at 2 h after occlusion. Sham operated rats underwent
the same surgical procedures without insertion of the suture.

HBO-PC regimen
Due to its potential toxic effects, HBO is currently restricted to short
sessions (less than 2 h), at pressures below the threshold of central
nervous system toxicity (0.3 MPa) (Tibbles and Edelsberg, 1996). In
our previous studies and preliminary experiments, we tested HBO-PC
at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 ATA and found that 2.5–3 ATA produced more pronounced protective results compared to 1–2 ATA. Therefore in this
study, we used HBO at 2.5 ATA for 1 h.
Rats were pressurized in a research hyperbaric chamber (1300B;
Sechrist) at 2.5 atm absolutes with 100% oxygen (ﬂow of 22 l/min).
Compression and decompression were maintained at a rate of 5
psi/min. HBO was administered for 1 h daily for 5 consecutive days
and the last session was performed 24 h before MCAO. In the
intervention groups, PPAR inhibitor GW9662 (4 mg/kg) or 10%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Vehicle) was injected intraperitoneally
1 h before MCAO.

2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
TTC staining was performed to determine the infarct volume at
24 h after MCAO as previously reported (Hu et al., 2011). The

possible interference of brain edema with infarct volume was
corrected by standard methods (whole contralateral hemisphere
volume − nonischemic ipsilateral hemisphere volume) and the
infracted volume was expressed as a percentage of the whole contralateral hemisphere.

Spectrophotometric assay of hemoglobin
Hemorrhagic volume was quantiﬁed with spectrophotometric assay
of brain hemoglobin content at 24 h after MCAO. Cerebral hemorrhage
was quantiﬁed using a previously described spectrophotometric assay
(Hu et al., 2011). A standard curve was obtained using a “virtual” model
of hemorrhage. Incremental volumes of homologous blood (0, 2, 4, 8,
16, 32 μl) were added to the perfused brain tissue. The hemispheric
brain was then homogenized in distilled water followed by 30-minute
centrifugation (13,000 ×g). Drabkin reagent (1.6 ml; Sigma) was added
to 0.4 ml supernatant aliquots and optical density was measured at
540 nm via spectrophotometer (Spectronix 3000; Milton-Roy).
Hemoglobin measurements were performed and compared with the
standard curve to obtain data in terms of hemorrhage volume. The total
hemispheric hemoglobin content was expressed as μl of blood per
hemisphere.

Neurological scores
A neurological examination was performed by a blinded investigator
as previously described with modiﬁcations (Garcia et al., 1995) at 24 h
after MCAO. The scores given to each rat at completion of the evaluation
was the summation of 7 individual test scores (spontaneous activity,
symmetry in the movement of four limbs, forepaw outstretching,
climbing, body proprioception, response to vibrissae touch, and beam
walking). The neurological scoring ranged from 3 (most severe deﬁcit)
to 21 (maximum).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for 15d-PGJ2
15d-PGJ2 brain levels were determined using an ELISA kit
(MyBioSource, Inc, Canada). Rats were fatally anesthetized with
isoﬂurane (≥%5) followed by cardiovascular perfusion with ice-cold
0.01 M phosphate buffered saline. Brains were ﬂash frozen in liquid
nitrogen immediately following removal and kept in − 80 °C. Right

hemisphere of the brain tissues were homogenized by sonication in an
ice-cold 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline and centrifuged for 15 min
at 1500 ×g. The supernatants were collected and aliquots were
stored at − 80 °C until tested. Enzyme immunoassay isolation and
prostaglandin quantiﬁcation were carried out following manufacturer's
instructions. Protein concentration of each sample was determined
using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit.
Western blot analysis
Animals were anesthetized and underwent transcardiac perfusion
using 0.01 M PBS until colorless perfusion ﬂuid was obtained from the
right atrium. Tissue samples of the ipsilateral hemisphere were
obtained and immersed in 0.5 ml of the Western blot sample buffer
and then sonicated for Western blot analysis. Protein concentration of
each sample was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The
Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (Hu
et al., 2011). Primary antibodies used were: PPARγ (sc-271392, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), TNF-α (sc-243, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), IL-1β

Results

MMPs' zymography
Similarly prepared protein samples as for Western blot were
subjected to gelatin zymography. Approximately 50 μg of each sample
was loaded per lane into the well of precast gels (10% polyacrylamide
minigels containing 0.1% gelatin; Invetrogen) with SDS running buffer
(1:1; Novex). Electrophoresis was performed with a Tris–glycine
running buffer at 125 V constant voltage for 1.5–2 h. The gel was removed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 100 ml of 2.7%
Triton X-100 (renature buffer, Invetrogen) on a rotary shaker, then
washed with distilled water 10 times. Each gel was incubated with
100 ml of development buffer (50 mM Tris base, 40 mM HCl, 200 mM
NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, and 0.2% Brij 35; Invetrogen) at 37 °C for 14 h on a
rotary shaker. Staining was performed with 100 ml of 0.5% Coomassie
blue G-250 in 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid for at least 1 h, and
gels were then destained with three changes of solutions. Gelatinolytic
activity was demonstrated as clear zones or bands at the appropriate
molecular weights. Human MMP-9 and human MMP-2 (from Chemicon
Temecula, CA) were used as standards. The activity of MMP-2 and
MMP-9 was quantiﬁed in ImageJ software.
Statistical analyses
Data were expressed as the mean ± SEM. Statistical differences
among groups were analyzed by using ANOVA followed by the Tukey

HBO-PC attenuated HT after MCAO in hyperglycemic rats dependent on
activation of PPARγ
Hyperglycemia induced extensive HT in ischemic territories at 24 h
after MCAO (Figs. 1A and B). HBO-PC reduced infarct volume (Figs. 1A
and B, p b 0.05 vs. DX + MCAO) and hemorrhage volume (Fig. 1C,
p b 0.05 vs. DX + MCAO) signiﬁcantly. After MCAO, animals showed
obvious neurological deﬁcits (Fig. 2A, p b 0.05 vs. DX + Sham) and
exhibited serious brain edema (Fig. 2B, p b 0.05 vs. DX + Sham);
HBO-PC signiﬁcantly improved neurological functions (Fig. 2A,
p b 0.05 vs. DX + MCAO) and attenuated brain edema (Fig. 2B,
p b 0.05 vs. DX + MCAO) at 24 h after MCAO. Blocking PPARγ by its
inhibitor GW9662 after each HBO-PC abolished the beneﬁcial effects
of HBO-PC (Figs. 1 and 2, p b 0.05 vs. DX + MCAO + HBO). NBO showed
the tendency to ameliorate the outcomes, but no signiﬁcant difference
(Figs. 1 and 2, p N 0.05 vs. DX + MCAO).
The mortality at 24 h after surgery in each group is: Sham + DX, 0
(0/20); DX + MCAO, 0.3333 (18/54); DX + MCAO + NBO, 0.2800
(14/50); DX + MCAO + HBO, 0.2400 (12/50); DX + MCAO + HBO +
Vehicle, 0.2500 (12/48); and DX + MCAO + HBO + GW9662, 0.3077
(16/52). HBO-PC showed the tendency to decrease mortality, but
there was no signiﬁcant difference compared with DX + MCAO group
(Fig. 2C, p N 0.05 vs. DX + MCAO).
The blood glucose levels at 2 h after injection of dextrose in all
groups were signiﬁcantly higher than the baseline and high glucose

HBO-PC increased the level of 15d-PGJ2 and PPARγ at 24 h after MCAO

Discussion

We measured the levels of PPARγ ligand 15d-PGJ2 in brain tissue by
ELISA and evaluated the expression of PPARγ by Western blots. HBO-PC
signiﬁcantly increased the level of 15d-PGJ2 in naïve rats 24 h after the
last HBO exposure (Fig. 3A, p b 0.05 vs. Naïve). The level of 15d-PGJ2 in
Sham and MCAO animals were relatively low, and HBO-PC signiﬁcantly
increased the level of 15d-PGJ2 at 24 h after MCAO (Fig. 3B, p b 0.05 vs.
DX + MCAO). PPARγ was seldom expressed in Sham animals, and
mildly increased 24 h after MCAO (Fig. 3C, p N 0.05 vs. DX + Sham).
HBO-PC greatly up-regulated the expression of PPARγ (Fig. 3C,
p b 0.05 vs. DX + MCAO).

In the present study, we observed that HBO-PC ameliorated the
hyperglycemia-enhanced HT and improved neurologic deﬁcits in
rats subjected to MCAO. Administration of PPARγ inhibitor GW9662
abolished the beneﬁcial effects of HBO-PC. HBO-PC prevented HT by
down-regulation of inﬂammatory molecules TNF-α and IL-1β and
suppressing the activity of MMP-9, which are mediated by upregulating 15d-PGJ2 and activating PPARγ. Our results strongly
suggested that HBO-PC might turn out to be an attractive strategy for
HT in ischemic stroke patients.
15d-PGJ2 is one of the prostaglandins of the J series (PGJs), which are
cyclopentenones synthesized from arachidonic acid via enzymatic
conversion by cyclooxygenases (COXs, COX-1 and COX-2, respectively)
and PGD synthase followed by non-enzymatic dehydration from PGD2
to a series of PGJs (Nosjean and Boutin, 2002). Acting as a physiologic
agonist for PPARγ, 15d-PGJ2 has been considered as a potential
endogenous protectant counteracting deleterious actions of the proinﬂammatory response in various stressful conditions. An analysis of
552 patients with an acute stroke admitted within 24 h after symptom
onset showed that increased plasma 15d-PGJ2 concentration is
associated with good early and late neurologic outcome and smaller
infarct volume, suggesting beneﬁcial role of 15d-PGJ2 for stroke patients
(Blanco et al., 2005). In experiment stroke models, 15d-PGJ2 has been
proven to be neuroprotective through anti-oxidation (Lin et al., 2006)
and anti-inﬂammation (Zhao et al., 2006). HBO-PC protected primary
cultured cortical neurons against oxygen-glucose deprivation by
releasing 15d-PGJ2 through activation of COX-2 (Zeng et al., 2012). In
agreement with these studies, we observed an improvement of

HBO-PC suppressed inﬂammation and attenuated BBB disruption by
decreasing MMP-9 at 24 h after MCAO
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the expression of inﬂammatory
molecules TNF-α and IL-1β increased, and HBO-PC effectively
suppressed the increase of TNF-α and IL-1β (Fig. 4, p b 0.05 vs. DX +
Sham). Administration of GW9662 before each HBO-PC removed the
effects of HBO-PC (Fig. 4, p b 0.05 vs. DX + MCAO + HBO-PC). The
protein level of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin dramatically
decreased after MCAO, and increased by HBO-PC (Fig. 4, p b 0.05 vs.
DX + MCAO).
In hyperglycemic rats, the activity of MMP-9 was greatly increased at
24 h after MCAO (p b 0.05 vs. DX + Sham, Figs. 5A, B); HBO-PC
remarkably decreased the activity of MMP-9 (p b 0.05 vs. DX + MCAO,
Figs. 5A, B); PPARγ inhibitor GW9662 reversed the results of HBO-PC
and increased the activity of MMP-9 (p b 0.05 vs. DX + MCAO + HBO-

neurological function and attenuation of HT in hyperglycemic MCAO
rats after HBO-PC, which is associated with suppressing inﬂammation
and preserving tight junction proteins by increasing 15d-PGJ2. The
rate-limiting step in the prostaglandin biosynthesis is the COXcatalyzed conversion of arachidonic acid mobilized from the membrane
phospholipid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) (Surh et al., 2011). In the
mouse model of surgical brain injury or rat model of transient global cerebral ischemia, HBO-PC alone signiﬁcantly increased COX-2 levels
(Cheng et al., 2011; Jadhav et al., 2009). Oxygen has been shown to promote prostacyclin synthesis in intact intrapulmonary arteries, which
may be mediated by increasing the activity of COX-2 (Shaul et al.,
1992, 1993).
After being activated by 15d-PGJ2, PPARγ forms a heterodimer with
another nuclear receptor PPAR-retinoid X receptor (RXR)-α and binds
to PPAR response elements in the promoter of their target genes. Recent
data have shown that PPARγ acts as a regulator of CNS inﬂammation
and is a powerful pharmacological target for CNS disease (Gillespie
et al., 2011). After stroke, the activation of PPARγ can antagonize
the harmful effects of oxidative stress and inﬂammation, indicating a
promising and neuroprotective role for PPARγ agonists in stroke
(Culman et al., 2007). Activation of PPARγ attenuated the expression
of ICAM-1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and various
inﬂammatory cytokines in ischemic brain tissue (Luo et al., 2006;
Pereira et al., 2005; Sundararajan et al., 2005). In agreement with
these studies, HBO-PC activated PPARγ signaling pathway and
signiﬁcantly decreased inﬂammation and suppressed the activity of
MMP-9 in the present study. HBO-PC attenuated the BBB disruption
and therefore reduced HT in the hyperglycemic MCAO rats.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that hyperglycemia enhanced HT
after MCAO; HBO-PC attenuated HT and improved neurological function

in MCAO rats. HBO-PC preserved the integrity of BBB by suppressing
inﬂammation through activating PPARγ pathway and decreased
inﬂammation. Our results suggested that HBO-PC might be a promising
approach to reduce HT in ischemic stroke.
