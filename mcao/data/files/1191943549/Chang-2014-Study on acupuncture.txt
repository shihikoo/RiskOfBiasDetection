ABSTRACT Objective: To investigate the inﬂuence of acupuncture parameters on the acupuncture effect through
the cluster analysis in Wistar rat model with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Methods: Duplicated MCAO
models by Zea-longa's thread ligation and chose rats with 1–3 scores assessed by Zausinger's six-score method
to be grouped. The rats were divided into 6 basic control groups [(including a normal group, a sham group, a model
control group, a model group without intervention, a Nimodipine group, a lateral-to-Renzhong (DU6) group] and 6
acupuncture groups [a Neiguan (PC6) group, a Weizhong (BL40) group, a Sanyinjiao (SP6) group, a Chize (LU5)
group, a Renzhong (DU6) group and a Feixue (non-acupoint) group]. In the acupuncture groups, for every acupoint
or needling site, 9 different parameters [2 factors (frequency and time) and 3 levels (180, 120, and 60 cpm of the
frequency and 5, 60, and 180 s of the time)] were set respectively by the orthogonal intersection method, in total
54 groups. The rats were treated by acupuncture with a lifting-thrusting manipulation once every 12 h, in total
6 times. Neurobehavioral scores, cerebral blood flow, infarction rate, microcirculation, light microscopy, etc.
were measured. The factor analysis was ﬁrst applied to get the comprehensive effect scores of the samples in the
acupuncture groups and then by which the cluster analysis was made with the statistical software of SPSS17.0.
Results: For the Neiguan (PC6) group, the exceptional results of acupuncture comprehensive effect were parameters
7, 8, 9, 10; the valid results were parameters 2, 3, 4, and the invalid were parameters 5, 6. For the Weizhong (BL40)
group, the exceptional results were parameters 2, 4; the valid results were parameters 3, 5, 6, 7, and the invalid were
parameters 8, 9, 10. For the Chize (LU5) group, the exceptional results were parameters 7, 8; the valid results were
parameters 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10; and the invalid was parameter 2. For the Sanyinjiao (SP6) group, the exceptional results
were parameters 4, 6; the valid results were parameters 2, 3, 5; and the invalid were parameters 7, 8, 9,10. For the
Renzhong (DU6) group, the exceptional results were parameters 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10; the valid results were parameters
2, 5; and the invalid was parameter 8. For the Non-acupoint group, the exceptional result was parameter 10; the
valid results were parameters 2, 3, 4, 7, 9; and the invalid were parameters 5, 6, 8. Conclusions: For each meridian
acupoint, different acupuncture parameters could consequently get a different acupuncture effect; each meridian
acupoint had the most suitable or optimal acupuncture parameters; acupuncture parameters might be the main
factors impacting on acupuncture effect.

Acupuncture parameters, mainly including
acupuncture frequency and time, are the main content
of acupuncture research and also a breakthrough point
of acupuncture quantitative research. They are the main
factors influencing the acupuncture effect. Different
acupuncture parameters lead to different effects;
and each meridian acupoint has its most appropriate
acupuncture parameters. By far, there are fewer studies
on the relationship between acupuncture quantity and
acupuncture parameters. In order to study acupuncture
parameters impacting on the acupuncture effect, on

Animal and Groups
A total of 648 adult male SPF Wister rats, with
the weight of around 250–300 g, were provided by the
Laboratory Animal Center of the Chinese Academy
of Medical Sciences. The rats were divided into 6
basic control groups [(including a normal group, a
sham group, a model control group, a model group
without intervention, a Nimodipine group, a lateral-toRenzhong (DU6) group] and 6 acupuncture groups
[a Neiguan (PC6) group, a Weizhong (BL40) group,
a Sanyinjiao (SP6) group, a Chize (LU5) group, a
Renzhong (DU6) group and a Feixue (non-acupoint)
group]. Moreover, 9 different parameter combinations
by orthogonal intersection method were respectively
set in every acupoint or needling group. There were
12 rats in each group, totally 54 groups.

Intervention of Parameters
Except the normal group, sham group, model
control group and Nimodipine group, the rest groups
were intervened by acupuncture according to the
orthogonal intersection method of acupuncture
parameters [2 factors (frequency and time) and 3
levels (180, 120, and 60 cpm of the frequency and 5,
60, and 180 s of the time), Table 1].

Intervention Time
After the model duplication was successful, the
model rats were completely awake for 1 h and then
acupunctured for the ﬁrst time, then once every 12 h,
in total 6 times.

DISCUSSION
The acupuncture cure is just the reinforcing and
reducing process of applying various methods on
the basis of clear discriminating between deficiency
and excess, determining the acupuncture points. All
kinds of acupuncture methods in nature all belong
to mechanical stimulation, so whether its reinforcing
method or reducing method involves a stimulus
quantity, namely the acupuncture treating quantity.
(6)
In the 1970s, Academician Shi Xue-min put
forward the concept of acupuncture quantity for
the first time, the so-called "acupuncture quantity
is that in clinical cure, according to the patient's
condition, the doctor determines the corresponding
tactics and enough stimulus quantity to achieve
the best curative effect. (7) Wang, et al (8) further
indicated that "acupuncture quantity" was just
comprehensive value of all the external physical
factors exerted by acupuncture, and nothing
with internal biological factors of body acupoint
when needling. But we thought that acupuncture
quantity, namely, acupuncture stimulating quantity,
was a relative amounts itself, which could affect
the acupuncture quantity. Stimulation parameters
contains the specific acupuncture methods, the
depth of the needle, the frequency and time of
operation, the retaining needle time, the number of
acupuncture, time interval, etc. Among them, the
acupuncture frequency and the acupuncture time,
are the main factors of acupuncture parameters. And
the acupuncture quantity is the indirect factor of the
acupuncture effect, because the acupuncture effect
could be affected by the direct factors, including
functional state of the body, physical factors, disease
factors and time factors and psychological factors,
etc., thus to determine the amount of acupuncture.
Although in the clinical practice, the basis
should be on the functional status, such as the

• 134 •

patient's physical condition, disease condition, but
acupuncture quantity should be also measured with
basic elements such as the frequency, the amplitude,
the acupuncture intensity and the time and so on, thus
can make the study of the acupuncture quantiﬁcation
objectiﬁed. Every stimulating parameter is not a ﬁxed
value, they can inﬂuence each other, if one (or more)
stimulating parameters change (or changes), the rest
of (or a) parameters will occur corresponding changes
(or change). Therefore, when the relation between
acupuncture methods and acupuncture effect is
researched, not only the single action of different
methods and different parameters should be studied,
but also the effect of combination forms of different
stimulation parameters in the same way should be
studied.(9) In this paper, 9 different combinations of
acupuncture parameters were set respectively by the
orthogonal intersection method with the two factors
(namely acupuncture frequency and acupuncture
time) and the 3 levels and the time of 5, 60, and 180 s
to study the inﬂuence of the acupuncture parameters
on the acupuncture effect. The rats were treated by
acupuncture with a lifting-thrusting manipulation once
every 12 h, in total 6 times. Neurobehavioral scores,
cerebral blood flow, infarction rate, microcirculation,
light microscope, etc. were measured. The
factor analysis was first applied to establish the
mathematical model for comprehensive evaluating
the effect of acupuncture in Wistar rats with MCAO,
then the comprehensive effect scores of the samples
were caculated in the acupuncture groups and then
by which the cluster analysis was made with the
statistical software of SPSS17.0.
Cluster analysis is an approach for studying
objects classification, and will sort samples or
variables according to their affinity or dissimilarity
degree in nature. In essence the data is divided into
several categories according to the distance, by
which the data "difference" within the category is as
small as possible, and the data "difference" between
categories is as large as possible.(10) This paper is
to make a cluster analysis on comprehensive scores
of the acupuncture effect within different parameters
of each sample in acupuncture groups by factor
analysis, so we can only choose the hierarchical
cluster method.(11) The factor analysis is applied to
get exact comprehensive scores of samples, but
the difference from various acupuncture parameter
combinations of each acupoint can not be clear

Chin J Integr Med 2014 Feb;20(2):130-135

at a glance. So, in order to research the impact
of acupuncture parameters on the acupuncture
effect, in the experiment with rat model of cerebral
infarction as the carrier, the cluster analysis was
used to conduct comprehensive scores of each
sample obtained from factor analysis in the different
parameters of each acupuncture group, thus making
the results simpliﬁed.
The study shows that for each meridian acupoint,
different acupuncture parameters can consequently
get a different acupuncture effect; but each acupoint
has the most appreciate acupuncture parameters;
acupuncture parameters are the main factors that can
have an impact on acupuncture effect. So in clinical
practice, to master and apply the best acupuncture
parameters of each meridian acupoint will get better
effects. But the mathematical relationship between the
acupuncture quantity and acupuncture parameters
(frequency and time) need further study.
The concept of acupuncture manipulation
quantitative arts includes two aspects of meaning: one
is the acupuncture method; the other is the stimulus
amount. The ultimate aim of treatment by acupuncture
is to achieve the best curative effect, and research
core of acupuncture manipulation quantitative arts is to
further obtain the relationship between time-effect and
quantity-effect through optimal treating methods and
parameters for a disease by acupuncture. Different
stimulation parameters can produced different
acupuncture treatment effects, the result is not only
beneﬁcial to analyzing acupuncture effect factors, but
also to seek the optimal acupuncture parameters, and
effectively guide the clinical treatment.(12)
Stimulating quantity of acupuncture manipulation
is an important factor to produce curative effect,
stimulating quantity of different acupuncture techniques
will produce different acupuncture effect. But it is
not the only factor in acupuncture effect, also with
the patient's physique, disease stage, acupoints
specificity, acupuncture time, etc.(13) Research shows
that acupuncture quantitative research is feasible, and
has its reliable scientific basis—image-number theory
of the book of changes.(14) Human body is an open
and complex giant system, in research acupuncture
concentration-response relationship in the future, the
system theory of Chinese medicine should also be
considered.
