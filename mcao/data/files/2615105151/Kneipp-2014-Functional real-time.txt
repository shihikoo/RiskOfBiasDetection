Abstract
Background and Purpose: Longitudinal functional imaging studies of stroke are key in identifying the disease progression
and possible therapeutic interventions. Here we investigate the applicability of real-time functional optoacoustic imaging
for monitoring of stroke progression in the whole brain of living animals.
Materials and Methods: The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to model stroke in mice, which were
imaged preoperatively and the occlusion was kept in place for 60 minutes, after which optoacoustic scans were taken at
several time points.
Results: Post ischemia an asymmetry of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the brain was observed as a region of hypoxia in the
hemisphere affected by the ischemic event. Furthermore, we were able to visualize the penumbra in-vivo as a localized
hemodynamically-compromised area adjacent to the region of stroke-induced perfusion deficit.
Conclusion: The intrinsic sensitivity of the new imaging approach to functional blood parameters, in combination with real
time operation and high spatial resolution in deep living tissues, may see it become a valuable and unique tool in the
development and monitoring of treatments aimed at suspending the spread of an infarct area.

[5]. Being based on light absorption, optoacoustics can directly
sense blood-related contrast, in particular concentration of
deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) and oxygenated hemoglobin
(HbO2), without introduction of contrast agents [6]. In addition,
the ability to visualize real time kinetics of uptake and clearance
of contrast agents, in particular in whole mouse brains, has
been recently demonstrated with this method [7].
In this study, real-time MSOT imaging [8] was applied for
longitudinal functional stroke imaging studies, aimed at identifying functional blood flow in the whole brain of a middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model in vivo. Scans
were made preoperatively for later comparison to post-operative
scans and as a control. Infarct volume analysis was performed
after the last in-vivo scan by means of histology after sacrificing
the animal.

Introduction
Clinical and small animal imaging studies on stroke aim to
further understanding into the development of the ischemic
lesion [1], which in turn may lead to more effective treatments.
Noninvasive functional imaging is central to these studies.
However, imaging modalities commonly used for stroke
visualization have generally high acquisition and running costs,
with some also lacking the sufficient specificity, imaging speed,
spatial resolution or penetration depth necessary for efficient
investigations of disease progression in small animal models [1–
3]. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a new
imaging modality that utilizes generation of ultrasonic waves by
wavelength-dependent absorption of ultrashort pulses of light in
the imaged tissues [4]. Therefore, MSOT maintains the good
functional contrast of the optical spectrum while also retaining
significant advantages that are commonly associated with
ultrasonic imaging, such as real-time operation and excellent
spatial resolution unaffected by light scattering in deep tissues

Functional Optoacoustic Imaging of MCAO in Mice

Following the initial validation scan, the MCAO procedure [9]
was performed outside the scanner. A small incision was made at
the neck of the animal and the left external and internal carotid
arteries (ECA, ICA) were freed from the surrounding tissue. A
coated filament was introduced into the common carotid artery
(CCA), advanced inside the ICA and secured to occlude the origin
of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), as illustrated in Figure 1A.
During occlusion, a second in-vivo scan was performed. After
60 min of ischemia, the filament was retracted, the wound closed,
and the animal allowed to survive for 24 hours. After 24 h, a final
MSOT scan was performed under anesthesia.

Methods
In-vivo MSOT Imaging
The non-invasive optoacoustic scans were performed in vivo by
acquiring whole-brain tomographical datasets formed from
coronal slices imaged at 15 different excitation wavelengths
between 710 and 850 nm. The system used was a cross-sectional
small animal MSOT scanner, which uses a 64-element ultrasonic
array for real-time 2D scanning [9]. MSOT offers high-resolution
real-time imaging in deep tissues, combining advantages of high
optical contrast and low scattering of ultrasound waves in
biological tissues. The acquired broadband acoustic signals are
generated through the optoacoustic phenomenon, whereby
thermoelastic expansion in the target is created by irradiating it
with nanosecond duration pulses of light from a tunable optical
parametric oscillator laser [6]. In addition to the focused
ultrasound transducer array, the MSOT scanner comprises an
animal holder with a gas mask for anesthesia supply, and a
motorized positioning stage to translate the animal relative to the
illumination plane (Fig. 1B). Fiber bundles are distributed to form
an illumination pattern that provides equal light fluence around
the circumference of the imaged region. Ultrasonic coupling
between the target and the transducer array is achieved by filling
the acquisition chamber with water; the water is heated to 34uC to
give a stable body temperature for the mice and a constant speed
of sound in the coupling medium. The animal is further protected
by a membrane, inhibiting direct contact between the coupling
medium and the animal.

Data Analysis
The tomographic optoacoustic data recorded at each wavelength were reconstructed by interpolated model-matrix inversion
[10]. The model-based framework allows for an accurate modeling
of light and sound propagation in tissues as well as ultrasounic
detector characteristics, thus most quantitative functional blood
parameters can be extracted. Reconstruction artifacts due to the
limited view of 172u of the transducer array are consequently
minimized by including the array geometry in the reconstruction
model. The optoacoustically-generated pressure distribution is
given as
p0 (r)!w(r)ma (r)

where p0 denotes the initially generated pressure at location r,
dependent upon the local light fluence w in J/m2 and the local
absorption coefficient ma in cm21. The reconstructed images are
subsequently spectrally unmixed, using a linear regression method
[4] in order to map distributions of Hb and HbO2 in the brain.
For every data point in the reconstructed images, the algorithm
uses least-squares to match the recorded optoacoustic spectrum to
the known absorption spectra of Hb and HbO2. This results in
distribution maps of the two states of hemoglobin, which are
regarded as the dominant absorbers in biological tissue. Spectral
unmixing is essentially performed on a per-pixel basis by solving
the set of linear equations:

Mouse Handling
All animals were treated in accordance with FELASA guidelines
and the study was approved by local government (Regierung von
Oberbayern, AZ 55.2-1-54-2531.2-6-10). This study saw seven
mice (strain: Crl:SKH1-Hrhr, hairless, unpigmented, immunocompetent) operated upon and scanned; the mice were anesthetised with 1.5% isoflurane (Penlon vaporizer, UK) vaporized in
pure oxygen; scans were made preoperatively for later comparison
to post-operative scans and as a control.

where li is the illumination wavelength ej is the wavelengthdependent molar extinction coefficient of a particular chromophore j having a local concentration cj [11].
Additional analysis using single wavelength images was
performed. The isosbestic point of hemoglobin is close to
790 nm, thus signals recorded at this wavelength are closely
related to the total cerebral blood volume (CBV). In order to
analyze overall trends in the study, two areas were compared pre-,
during, and post-ischemia at this wavelength. The comparison
made was ratios of the mean value of a region of interest (ROI) in
the ischemic cortex to the mean of its contralateral counterpart
(marked by red squares in Figs. 2A and 2C); ratios were also taken
for ROIs located in the striatum (marked by green squares in
Figs. 2A and 2C). Percentage changes of the ratios relative to each
pre-ischemia value were calculated. For statistical comparisons of
absolute ratio data, the Friedman Repeated Measures Analysis of
Variance on Ranks was performed. If a significant difference was
detected, Tukey Test (all pairwise multiple comparison procedures) was used as post hoc analysis; p,0.05 was considered
significant.

perfusion [12], resulting in the Hb-signal asymmetry after 24
hours.
Similar asymmetry is visible during the ischemia, as can be seen
in Fig. 3. It is hypothesized that this hemodynamically compromised area represents part of the ischemic penumbra, which
consists of hypoperfused but still viable tissue [13]. Even 24 h after
the onset of stroke this region is not completely destroyed but may,
depending on the course of the stroke, recover or become necrotic
[14]. As can be further observed in Fig. 3, the Hb signal varies in
strength and spatial distribution from mouse to mouse. While
Mouse A exhibited the largest volume of increased Hb, mice B and
C showed smaller areas, as can also be verified via the
corresponding histological slices (infarct volumes at 24 h as
analyzed from the histological sections: mouse A: 58.5 mm3,
mouse B: 49 mm3, mouse C: 48.5 mm3). The size of the area of
Hb-asymmetry and the associated signal strength therefore appear
to be closely related to the histological infarct volume. Some mice
appear to show little or no Hb signal in the cortex even after
reperfusion (mouse A and B in Fig. 3). The infarct core has no (or
dramatically reduced) cellular activity and thus limited oxygen
consumption without the need to deoxygenate the present
hemoglobin, resulting in pseudo-normal or reduced Hb signal
[14].
During artery occlusion, the total CBV in the ischemic core
located in the cortex is reduced (Fig. 4A). This reduction in CBV

Histological Validation
The animals were then sacrificed and their brains excised and
frozen at 280uC. To validate the stroke area post mortem coronal
brain slices were taken using a cryostat with two 10 mm sections
being mounted on a glass slide every 500 mm. H&E staining was
performed and the infarct volumes were analyzed.

Results
A typical cross-sectional single wavelength optoacoustic image
mainly reveals the major vessels and other anatomical features in
the head. These correlate to some of the features that can be
identified in the histological slices taken post mortem (Fig. 2A).
However, the functional characteristics can be better visualized in
the images spectrally unmixed for the presence of Hb and HbO2
(Fig. 2B). When comparing the hemoglobin Hb signal of the
preoperative scans to that of the scans taken 24 hours later, a clear
asymmetry throughout a large portion of the brain becomes
visible, as can be seen in Figure 2C. The signal likely corresponds
to part of the tissue still suffering from hypoperfusion after the
stroke. The Hb signal did not correspond directly to the necrotic
ischemic lesion found in the stained coronal slices, but rather to
the immediate surroundings of the lesion. While the hemisphere is
reperfused after the 60-minute occlusion time, the area adjacent to
the ischemic lesion appears to experience further deficient

asymmetry in the vicinity of the infarcted regions, as also apparent in the corresponding histological sections.

The ratios between hemispheres demonstrate different longitudinal behavior in different areas of the brain. While cortex ratios
dropped during ischemia for all mice, returning to nearly normal
values after reperfusion, similar ratios in the striatum areas
increased for all mice during artery occlusion and remained
elevated at 24 h following reperfusion. It was previously confirmed
that, due to the less pronounced reduction of blood flow in the
penumbral region, autoregulatory dilation of the local cerebral
circulation leads to an increase of CBV [15]. In the case that blood
flow is sufficient, the cells located in the hypoxic penumbra will
maintain metabolism and survive the occlusion; where blood flow
is insufficient to support cell activity over time, the area will
become part of the infarct.
Indeed, the investigation into potential treatments for stroke
necessitates non-invasive longitudinal studies. Here, through noninvasive functional MSOT imaging, it was possible to visualize the
penumbra as a localized hypoxic area in the brain. Potential future
studies could investigate the how different treatments affect the
development of this hypoxic area, and thus limit the spread of the
necrotic core. From a technical perspective, it would be ideal to
simultaneously capture true three-dimensional MSOT data from
the entire brain, which is a subject of our ongoing investigations.
This would further allow achieving isotropic resolution in the
imaged region, reduce out-of-plane image artifacts and lead to
overall improvement of the data quantification abilities.

results in a reduced ROI-ratio in all mice. At 24 h following
reperfusion, the ratios have returned to nearly normal values. The
averaged data of all 7 mice show that a significant difference exists
between ratios during and 24 h post- ischemia (illustrated by the
asterisks in Fig. 4C). No difference exists between pre- and 24 h
post-ischemia. For the ROIs located in the striatum, a different
trend is apparent (Figure 4B). While the ratios increase during
artery occlusion for all mice, they further remain elevated also at
24 h following reperfusion. Overall, the averaged data for all 7
mice show a significant difference between the ischemic and postischemic periods as compared to pre-ischemia conditions (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
The current study investigated applicability of real-time
multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) for the monitoring of stroke progression following MCAO in the whole brain of
living mice. The in vivo optoacoustic scans of the whole animal
head revealed the major vessels and their functional oxygenation
parameters. Post ischemia an asymmetry of deoxygenated
hemoglobin in the brain was observed as a region of hypoxia in
the hemisphere affected by the ischemic event. This region was
mainly located in the border zone adjacent to necrotic tissue and
was present at 24 h post occlusion. Since similar asymmetry is
found during the ischemia this hemodynamically compromised
area is hypothesized to be part of the hypoperfused, but still viable,
ischemic penumbra. Histological findings further confirmed that
the size of the area of Hb-asymmetry and the associated signal
strength, as revealed in the in-vivo optoacsoustic scans, are closely
related to the infarct volume.

Conclusions
In summary it has been shown that, although the ischemic
lesion was not directly detectable using MSOT, an adjacent

localized region with characteristic hemodynamic disturbance was
detected throughout the brain that most certainly reflects the
ischemic penumbra. The unique capacity to monitor the
penumbra development non-invasively and longitudinally without
the introduction of contrast agents demonstrates further potential
for investigating the ability of acute stroke therapies aimed at
limiting the lesion size. Finally, the intrinsic sensitivity of MSOT to
functional blood parameters, in combination with real time

operation and high spatial resolution in deep tissues, may see it
become a valuable and unique tool in functional stroke studies.
