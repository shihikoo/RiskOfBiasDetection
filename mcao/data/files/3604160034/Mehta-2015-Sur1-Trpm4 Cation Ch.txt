The nonselective monovalent cation channel transient receptor
potential melastatin 4 (Trpm4) is transcriptionally upregulated in
neural and vascular cells in animal models of brain infarction. It
associates with sulfonylurea receptor 1 (Sur1) to form Sur1-Trpm4
channels, which have critical roles in cytotoxic edema, cell death,
blood-brain barrier breakdown, and vasogenic edema. We examined
Trpm4 expression in postmortem brain specimens from 15 patients
who died within the Ô¨Årst 31 days of the onset of focal cerebral ischemia. We found increased Trpm4 protein expression in all cases
using immunohistochemistry; transcriptional upregulation was conÔ¨Årmed using in situ hybridization of Trpm4 messenger RNA. Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 colocalized and coassociated
with Sur1 within ischemic endothelial cells and neurons. Coexpression
of Sur1 and Trpm4 in necrotic endothelial cells was also associated
with vasogenic edema indicated by upregulated perivascular tumor
necrosis factor, extravasation of serum immunoglobulin G, and associated inÔ¨Çammation. Upregulated Trpm4 protein was present up to
1 month after the onset of cerebral ischemia. In a rat model of middle
cerebral artery occlusion stroke, pharmacologic channel blockade by
glibenclamide, a selective inhibitor of sulfonylurea receptor, mitigated
perivascular tumor necrosis factor labeling. Thus, upregulated Sur1Trpm4 channels and associated blood-brain barrier disruption and cerebral edema suggest that pharmacologic targeting of this channel may
represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the clinical management
of patients with cerebral ischemia.

INTRODUCTION
Cerebral infarcts account for 5.5 million deaths worldwide each year and are a leading cause of long-term disability
(1Y3). Despite tremendous progress in our understanding of
the pathophysiology of strokes, ongoing efforts to identify
novel molecular targets have yet to yield new therapies. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator remains the only
medication speciÔ¨Åcally approved by national regulatory agencies for use in patients with ischemic stroke; however, for a
variety of reasons, it is used in less than 20% of stroke victims
(4Y7). Moreover, its use is associated with an increased risk of
intracranial hemorrhage (8). Despite the devastating effects
of malignant cerebral edema on large territorial infarcts, the
only pharmacotherapeutic option for this complication is osmotherapy, the effects of which remain unproven. There remains a
critical need to improve our understanding of the molecular
pathogenesis of this devastating neurologic condition to identify more effective therapeutic strategies.
Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (Trpm4) is a
member of a large protein superfamily consisting of 28
mammalian cation channels (9,10). Most members of the Trp
family are permeable to divalent cations. The exceptionsV
Trpm4 and Trpm5Vare Ca2+-impermeable channels that
transport monovalent cations exclusively and nonselectively
(9,10). Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 channels are
activated by an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ or by a decrease in
cytosolic ATP (11). Accumulating data show that there is
upregulation of Trpm4 in microvascular endothelial cells,
neurons, and glia in experimental rat models of stroke, spinal
cord injury, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (12Y15). Emerging
evidence suggests that Trpm4 interacts with sulfonylurea receptor 1 (Sur1) to form a novel ion channel, the Sur1-Trpm4
channel (15), which functions critically in the pathophysiology of various acute CNS injuries. Sulfonylurea receptor
1YTrpm4 channels contribute to cytotoxic edema, serve as
end-executioners in accidental necrotic death induced by ATP
depletion or reactive oxygen species (16), and participate in
blood-brain barrier breakdown and formation of ionic and
vasogenic edema (14,17).
Expression of Trpm4 has been investigated in tissue
specimens obtained from patients with multiple sclerosis (18)
and subarachnoid hemorrhage (14), but it has not yet been
studied in human cerebral infarcts. Here, we sought to determine whether upregulation of Trpm4 protein and messenger

RNA (mRNA) is present in infarcted human cerebral cortex
and whether Trpm4 protein coassociates with Sur1 to form
Sur1-Trpm4 channels in focal cerebral ischemia in humans,
and we tested the effects of a selective inhibitor of sulfonylurea receptor on an animal model of acute cerebral ischemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human Tissues

Rat Model of Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Animal experiments were performed following a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of Maryland. All experiments
were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and
regulations in the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made to
minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.
Male Wistar rats (275Y325 g; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN)
were anesthesized (ketamine 60 mg/kg and xylazine 7.5 mg/kg
intraperitoneally). Peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2)
via pulse oximetry and temperature were carefully regulated,
and all surgical procedures were performed aseptically. Middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) was achieved using an intraluminal thread. A midline incision was made to expose the
right common carotid artery, external carotid artery, and internal carotid artery. A 4-0 monoÔ¨Ålament nylon suture with a
rounded tip approximately 0.26 mm in diameter was inserted
via the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery
and was advanced by approximately 18 mm to occlude the
middle cerebral artery, as monitored by Doppler Ô¨Çowmetry.
After 120 minutes, the occluder was removed to allow reperfusion. The external carotid artery stump was ligated, and the
neck incision was closed. Using an automatic homeothermic
blanket control unit, we maintained animal body temperature
at 37-C throughout the procedure and during postsurgical

Glibenclamide Treatment
Drug formulation of glibenclamide (number G2539;
Sigma, St Louis, MO) in dimethyl sulfoxide and preparation
of miniosmotic pumps were performed as previously described
(19). Treatment consisted of intraperitoneal administration of a
single loading dose of glibenclamide (10 Kg/kg) or an equivalent volume of vehicle within 10 minutes of ischemia and
continuous infusion (1.0 KL/hour) via miniosmotic pumps
(Alzet 2001; Alzet Corp, Cupertino, CA) beginning at the end
of surgery, resulting in delivery of 200 ng/hour or an equivalent volume of vehicle subcutaneously for 1 week. The dose
of glibenclamide used does not result in hypoglycemia (17).

Antibodies
The custom anti-Trpm4 and anti-Sur1 antibodies used
have been previously described (15). The antigenic peptide
for Trpm4 was the N-terminal intracellular domain of mouse
Trpm4, corresponding to amino acids 1 to 612 (NP 780339).
Anti-Trpm4 antibodies were raised in chicken and used at
1:200 dilution. The antigenic peptide for Sur1 was the intracellular nucleotide-binding domain 1 of Sur1 (rat Sur1 complementary DNA amino acids 598Y965 of NP 037171). Anti-Sur1
antibodies were raised in rabbit and used at 1:200 dilution.
Other primary antibodies included the following: rabbit antiY
cytokeratin 20 (prediluted; Ventana, Tucson, AZ) for colonic
epithelial cells; mouse antiYglial Ô¨Åbrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
(1:500, CY3-conjugated, C-9205; Sigma) for astrocytes; mouse
anti-NeuN (1:100, MAB377; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for
neurons; goat anti-CD31 (PECAM-1) (1:200, sc-1506; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for endothelial cells; goat
antiYimmunoglobulin G (IgG) (1:500, Ô¨Çuorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]Yconjugated, NB7477; Novus Biologicals, Littleton,
CO) for IgG; goat anti-TNF (1:100, sc-1350; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) for TNF; rabbit anti-myeloperoxidase (1:200,
A0398; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) for neutrophils; and mouse
antiYrat endothelial cell antigen 1 (1:100, MA1-81510; Thermo
Fisher, Rockford, IL) for rat endothelium.

Immunohistochemistry and FoÃàrster Resonance
Energy Transfer
DeparafÔ¨Ånized sections were rinsed in ethanol and
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mmol/L,
pH 7.4). For antigen retrieval, slides were placed in citrate buffer
(10 mmol/L, pH 8.0), heated in a microwave oven at 900 W
for 10 minutes, and washed in PBS. Slides were incubated
with a mixture of 5% goat serum (Sigma) and 0.2% Triton X100 for 1 hour at room temperature before overnight incubation at 4-C with anti-Trpm4 and/or anti-Sur1 antibodies
and, in some cases, with a cell-speciÔ¨Åc or anti-IgG primary
antibody. Slides were rinsed again in PBS. Single-label immunohistochemistry for Trpm4 was developed using biotinconjugated secondary antibody. Sections were incubated in
PBS with 0.3% H2O2 for 30 minutes to block endogenous
peroxidase activity. After overnight incubation with primary

The tissue collection protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Maryland
(Baltimore, MD). Patients who died within 31 days of cerebral
ischemia documented between January 2010 and December
2012 and who underwent autopsy were identiÔ¨Åed retrospectively by reviewing the records of the Department of Pathology
at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Within these
constraints, 15 focal cerebral infarcts originating from 13 patients were identiÔ¨Åed. For comparison, contralateral cortex
samples were evaluated as control tissue. Brain specimens from
6 patients with documented absence of ischemic lesions also
were examined as controls. For additional validation of antibodies, sections of normal colon surgically removed from
2 patients during bypass surgery were also evaluated. Standard
tissue Ô¨Åxation protocols (7Y10 days in formalin) were applied.
Histologic validation of the presence or absence of an
ischemic lesion in brain specimens was performed by a neuropathologist in all cases. Representative parafÔ¨Ån-embedded
tissue blocks were selected from each case for detailed evaluation. For normal brains, blocks encompassing representative frontal or parietal cortices were studied. Blocks were
sectioned at 6 Km and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or
prepared for immunohistochemistry.

recovery. After the procedure, 12 rats were randomly assigned
to vehicle treatment (n = 6) or glibenclamide treatment (n = 6).
At 48 hours, the animals were killed and their brains were
analyzed for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) expression.

Analysis of Trpm4, Sur1, IgG, and TNF
Protein Expression
Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 immunoreactivity was analyzed for each cell typeYspeciÔ¨Åc marker for each
case (Table). All sections were immunolabeled as a single
batch, and all images were collected using uniform parameters of magniÔ¨Åcation and exposure, as previously described
(20,21). Two areas encompassing ischemic lesions or controls
were randomly selected for construction of a montage, with
each montage composed of 16 images (each 300  400 Km)
acquired at 20 magniÔ¨Åcation. Images were independently
evaluated by 2 observers who were blinded to demographic
and clinical data. SpeciÔ¨Åc Trpm4 immunoreactivity associated
with each cell typeYspeciÔ¨Åc marker for each case was evaluated. Areas of maximal labeling were scored for each case
using a semiquantitative scale ranging from 0 to 4 as follows:
0, none; 1 (+), weak punctuate labeling present in rare cells
(G10%); 2 (++), weak punctate staining in scattered cells or
aggregates (G50%); 3 (+++) strong punctate staining present
in many cells (950%); 4 (++++) strong diffuse staining of
most cells (990%). The overall concordance between the 2
observers was more than 90%. In cases of disagreement, independent re-evaluation was performed by both observers to
arrive at the Ô¨Ånal score. Sulfonylurea receptor 1 immunoreactivity for each cell typeYspeciÔ¨Åc marker for each case had
been previously reported (22).

Unbiased measurements of speciÔ¨Åc IgG or TNF labeling within regions of interest were obtained, using NISElements AR software (Nikon Instruments), from sections of
acute lesions (Cases 1Y4) and controls immunolabeled in a
single batch, as previously described (23). All region-ofinterest images for a given signal were captured using uniform
parameters of magniÔ¨Åcation, area, exposure, and gain. To
quantify IgG or TNF, we deÔ¨Åned a circular region of interest
as a perimeter encompassing vessels (with a diameter twice
that of the vessels) within the infarct or control brain. For each
region of interest, a histogram of pixel intensity was constructed to determine the intensity of background labeling.
Pixels within the region of interest were deÔ¨Åned as having
speciÔ¨Åc labeling if their intensity was more than 3 times that
of background. The area occupied by pixels with speciÔ¨Åc labeling was used to calculate the percentage of the region of
interest with speciÔ¨Åc labeling.

In Situ Hybridization of Trpm4 mRNA
Digoxigenin (DIG)Ylabeled probes (antisense, 5¬∂CCGAGAGTGGAATTCCCGGATGAGGCGGTAACGCT
GC-3¬∂; sense, 5¬∂-GCAGCGTTACCGCCTCATCCGGGAAT
TCCACTCTCGG-3¬∂), designed to hybridize nucleotides 3288
to 3324 located within the coding sequence of the human
Trpm4 gene (NM 017636), were supplied by Integrated DNA
Technologies Inc (Coralville, IA). In situ hybridization was
performed on 10-Km-thick sections of acute lesions (Cases
1Y4) and controls using an IsHyb In Situ Hybridization Kit
(Biochain Institute Inc, Newark, CA), according to the manufacturer‚Äôs protocol. DeparafÔ¨Ånization and rehydration were
performed as described previously. Sections were incubated
in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)Ytreated PBS and Ô¨Åxed in
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes. After being
rinsed twice with DEPC-PBS, slides were treated with proteinase K 10 Kg/mL at 37-C for 10 minutes. Slides were
washed in DEPC-PBS, rinsed with DEPC-H2O, and prehybridized with ready-to-use prehybridization solution (BioChain
Institute Inc) for 3 hours at 50-C. The DIG-labeled probe was
diluted in hybridization buffer (BioChain Institute Inc) and applied at 4 ng/KL. Sections were incubated at 45-C for 16 hours.
Posthybridization washing and immunologic detection, using
anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase with nitro blue tetrazolium/5bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate as substrate, were performed
as recommended by the manufacturer. Alkaline phosphataseY
conjugated anti-DIG antibodies (1:100, PBS-diluted; BioChain
Institute Inc) were incubated on slides for 2 hours. Finally,
slides were rinsed in distilled H2O and immunolabeled for
Trpm4 protein using a Ô¨Çuorescent secondary antibody, as described previously. The dark-purple reaction product represents
Trpm4 mRNA; green Ô¨Çuorescence indicates immunohistochemical staining for Trpm4 protein. In situ hybridization of
Sur1 has been previously reported (22).

Statistical Analysis
Two-tailed Fisher exact test was used to determine the
contingency of absent or weak (0/+/++) versus prominent or
diffuse (+++/++++) Trpm4 staining in different cell types
present within infarcted and noninfarcted cortices. Scores for
Trpm4 expression in different cell types were additionally

antibody, sections were incubated with biotinylated secondary
antibody (1:500, BA-1000, goat anti-chicken; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 2 hours. After washing in PBS,
sections were incubated in avidin biotin solution (Vector
Laboratories), and color was developed in diaminobenzidine
chromogen solution (0.02% diaminobenzidine in sodium acetate 0.175 mol/L) activated with 0.01% hydrogen peroxide.
Cresyl violet was used as counterstain to visualize cell nuclei.
Sections were rinsed, mounted, dehydrated, and coverslipped
with DPX mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Services,
Fort Washington, PA). Omission of primary antibodies was
used as negative control.
To show localization of Trpm4 and/or Sur1 within
identiÔ¨Åed cell types and/or coexpression with IgG, we performed immunoÔ¨Çuorescence microscopy of anti-Trpm4 or
anti-Sur1 antibodies in addition to cell-speciÔ¨Åc and anti-IgG
primary antibodies using the standard protocol, as described
previously. Slides were incubated for 1 hour with Ô¨Çuorescencelabeled species-appropriate secondary antibodies (1:500, Alexa
Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 555; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR) at room temperature. Omission of primary antibody
was used as negative control. Sections were coverslipped with
polar mounting medium containing anti-fade reagent and 4¬∂,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen). Immunolabeled
sections were visualized using epiÔ¨Çuorescence microscopy
(Nikon Eclipse 90i; Nikon Instruments Inc, Melville, NY).
Antibody-based FoÃàrster resonance energy transfer (FRET)
was performed on acute lesions (Cases 1Y4) using anti-Sur1 and
anti-Trpm4 antibodies, as described (14,15), except that FRET
imaging and measurements of FRET efÔ¨Åciency were performed
using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope.

Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 protein expression in infarcted and noninfarcted cortices was analyzed
using immunohistochemistry. Representative sections of acute
infarcts are shown in Figure 2. Immunoperoxidase preparations revealed prominent Trpm4 immunoreactivity in virtually
all neural and vascular cells (Table; Fig. 2A), whereas noninfarcted contralateral and control cortices demonstrated only
weak immunoreactivity in rare cells and/or background neuropil
(Table; Fig. 2B).
ImmunoÔ¨Çuorescent preparations further demonstrated
marked upregulation of Trpm4 in neural and vascular cells in
ischemic infarcts (Figs. 2C, E, G, I, K). Endothelial cells of
capillaries, arterioles, and venules exhibited diffuse membranous and cytoplasmic expression and colabeled for the endothelial cell marker PECAM-1 (CD31) (Figs. 2C, E, G).

Sur1-Trpm4 Channel in Human Cerebral Infarcts

Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 immunolabeling also
was prominent in neurons immunoreactive to NeuN (Fig. 2I)
and in astrocytes immunoreactive to GFAP (Fig. 2K). Neurons, endothelial cells, and astrocytes in noninfarcted contralateral and control cortices exhibited weak or no Trpm4
labeling (Table; Figs. 2D, F, H, J, L).
In situ hybridization studies showed de novo transcriptional upregulation of Trpm4 mRNA in acute lesions. We
observed strong labeling of cortical endothelial cells of capillaries, arterioles, and venules, and upregulation in neurons
(Fig. 3, middle column) within ischemic cortices. In situ hybridization signals for Trpm4 mRNA were present in cells
that were strongly immunopositive for Trpm4 protein (Fig. 3,
left column), whereas contralateral and control cortices showed
only faint in situ labeling in rare cells (Fig. 3, right column).

found in all cell types, relative to controls (p G 0.05 for astrocytes; p G 0.01 for endothelial cells, neurons, and neutrophils) (Table). Neurons stained prominently in acute lesions,
with mild regression of staining noted with postinfarct interval
(p G 0.01) (Table). Endothelial cells and neutrophils exhibited
sustained Trpm4 upregulation across time (Table). Astrocytes
exhibited a unique pattern of Trpm4 immunoreactivity: In
noninfarcted cortex, Trpm4 appeared as punctate perinuclear
staining, whereas a progressive increase in the extent of cytoplasmic and membranous immunopositivity was observed
with postinfarct interval (p G 0.01) (Table; Fig. 4).

Pathologic Correlates of Sur1-Trpm4 Channel
Upregulation in Cerebral Infarcts
Sulfonylurea receptor 1Ypositive/Trpm4-positive endothelial cells and Sur1-positive/Trpm4-positive neurons present in infarcted cerebral cortex and peri-infarct zones showed
prominent membrane irregularities and frank blebbing, consistent with cytotoxic edema (Fig. 7A). Coexpression of Sur1
and Trpm4 in abnormal-appearing endothelial cells also was
associated with vasogenic edema, as evidenced by upregulated perivascular labeling for IgG (Figs. 7BYG), TNF (Fig. 7I),
and myeloperoxidase (Fig. 7J). Membrane blebbing was not
identiÔ¨Åed in Trpm4-negative neural or vascular cells. In addition, membrane blebbing was not seen in Trpm4-negative or
Trpm4-positive astrocytes present in infarcted or noninfarcted
cortices (Fig. 4).

Inhibition of Sur1 in a Rat Model of MCAo Stroke
To assess the consequences of Sur1-Trpm4 channel
expression, we evaluated the effects of pharmacologic inhibition of Sur1 with glibenclamide in a rat model of MCAo
stroke. Extravasation of serum proteins is known to promote
neuroinÔ¨Çammation. Inhibition of Sur1 was found to mitigate

expression of TNF, an acute-phase reactant cytokine (Fig. 8),
suggesting a critical proinÔ¨Çammatory role for Sur1-Trpm4
channel expression in focal cerebral ischemia.

DISCUSSION
This is the Ô¨Årst report to systematically analyze Trpm4
expression in adult human brains after the onset of focal cerebral ischemia. Our Ô¨Åndings indicate that Trpm4 mRNA
and Trpm4 protein are upregulated in infarcted human cortex.
The current study is in accordance with a report of Trpm4
upregulation in a preclinical model of stroke (13). In contrast
to the Ô¨Åndings in the animal model, however, our study
showed that Trpm4 upregulation was sustained in infarcted
human tissues during acute and subacute postischemic intervals. Analysis of Trpm4 expression in human neurologic
disease was previously limited to specimens originating from
patients with multiple sclerosis (18) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (14). SigniÔ¨Åcant upregulation of Trpm4 was identiÔ¨Åed
under both neuropathologic conditions. In animal models,
Trpm4 expression has been associated with inÔ¨Çammationinduced axonal and neuronal injuries in demyelinating lesions
(18). Furthermore, endothelial cell upregulation of Trpm4 has
been associated with inÔ¨Çammation and blood-brain barrier
permeability in a model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (14),
and with capillary fragmentation and secondary hemorrhage
in a model of spinal cord injury (12). Together, these studies
suggest a critical function for Trpm4 in acute CNS injuries of
varying etiology.
In a prior analysis, we showed prominent upregulation
of Sur1 (a member of the ATP-binding cassette protein
superfamily) in neural and vascular cells of these same postmortem infarct specimens (22). The current study complements our prior Ô¨Åndings and is the Ô¨Årst to report that Trpm4,
a voltage-dependent cation channel, colocalizes with Sur1 in
neurons, endothelial cells, astrocytes, and neutrophils present
in human cerebral infarcts. Furthermore, this is the Ô¨Årst study
to document, via antibody-based FRET, the coassociation
of upregulated Trpm4 and Sur1 in human cerebral infarcts.
Together, the Ô¨Åndings indicate that Sur1-Trpm4 channels
(formerly known as Sur1-regulated NCCa-ATP channels) are
present in infarcted human cerebral cortex, but not in noninfarcted control specimens.
The Sur1-Trpm4 cation channel is not constitutively
present in CNS tissues but is transcriptionally upregulated de
novo under neuropathologic conditions. Recent data showed
stable heteromultimeric assembly of Sur1 and Trpm4 and
demonstrated that Sur1 regulates the calcium sensitivity of
Trpm4, the pore-forming subunit of the Sur1-Trpm4 channel

Sulfonylurea receptor 1 was previously reported to be
upregulated in endothelial cells, neurons, and astrocytes in
infarcted cerebral cortices (22). Here, we found that upregulated Trpm4 colocalized with Sur1 in endothelial cells, neurons, and astrocytes in infarcted cerebral cortices (Fig. 5). We
used FRET to determine whether colocalized proteins also
coassociated. FoÃàrster resonance energy transfer analysis demonstrated that Sur1 and Trpm4 coassociated in endothelial cells
(Figs. 6AYD) and neurons. FoÃàrster resonance energy transfer
efÔ¨Åciency, which reÔ¨Çects the proximity of 2 Ô¨Çuorophores, was
13% in infarcted cortices and 0% in controls (Fig. 6E).

Sur1-Trpm4 Channel in Human Cerebral Infarcts

(15). The channel is activated by a rise in intracellular Ca2+ or
by depletion of intracellular ATP. Channel activation induces
monovalent cation inÔ¨Çux that results in cell membrane depolarization.
Ca2+ is an important second messenger, and signiÔ¨Åcant
amounts of energy are expended to maintain intracellular
concentrations of free Ca2+ at physiologic levels (√à10,000-fold
lower than extracellular levels). Because a large electrochemical driving force promotes Ca2+ inÔ¨Çux into cells, homeostasis
requires Ca2+ extrusion, which is achieved through the plasma
membrane Ca2+-ATPase pump, the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger, and
other energy-dependent mechanisms. Oxygen, glucose, and
energy restriction during cerebral ischemia rapidly results in
increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ (25). If unchecked, excess Ca2+
can lead to enhanced phospholipase and protease activities,
inducing irreversible catabolic processes and producing free
radicals that activate multiple cell death pathways. Thus, there
is an important adaptive advantage in upregulating the expression of Sur1-Trpm4 (i.e. the membrane depolarization
induced by Ca2+-mediated activation of Sur1-Trpm4 channels
provides negative feedback that reduces the electrical driving
force for inward Ca2+ Ô¨Çux and thereby acts to protect the cell

from excessive Ca2+). However, sustained channel activity, as
can be brought about by severe ATP depletion, results in
continuous monovalent cation inÔ¨Çux, converting an adaptive
advantage into a maladaptive phenomenon that leads to cytotoxic edema and necrotic (oncotic) cell death (16).
The potential beneÔ¨Åts of Sur1-Trpm4 channel blockade
in stroke have been demonstrated in various studies. In a rat
model of MCAo stroke, Trpm4 gene suppression was associated with preserved vascular integrity, enhanced angiogenesis, reduced infarct volume, and improved functional
recovery (13). A study using primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed that suppression of
Trpm4 by pharmacologic inhibition or by small interfering
RNA protected cells against lipopolysaccharide-induced cell
death (26). Sulfonylurea therapy via low-dose glibenclamide
(a.k.a. glyburide), which binds to Sur1 and potently inhibits
the Sur1-Trpm4 channel, has been shown to confer protective
effects, including reduced edema, cortical stroke volume, and
overall mortality in various rodent stroke models (27Y29).
Moreover, sulfonylurea therapy in stroke patients with diabetes has been associated with improved neurologic function
and reduced rates of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation

FIGURE 7. Oncosis and membrane blebbing in Sur1-positive/Trpm4-positive cells in acute cerebral infarcts. Note the cytoplasmic
vacuolization, membrane thickening, and irregularities present in endothelial cells of a small venule and a labeled neuron (A).
Intravascular IgG is present within Sur1-negative microvessels (B) but is extravasated around Sur1-positive endothelium in infarcts
(C). Similarly, intravascular IgG is present within Trpm4-negative microvessels (E) but is extravasated around Trpm4-positive
endothelium in infarcts (F). Quantitative evaluation of IgG labeling in infarcted and noninfarcted regions of interest (ROI) revealed
signiÔ¨Åcant increases in perivascular IgG around Sur1-expressing and Trpm4-expressing versus nonexpressing vessels (D, G).
Channel expression in microvessels is also associated with early hemorrhagic transformation (H), perivascular TNF labeling (I), and
inÔ¨Çammation (J). ** p G 0.01. Original magniÔ¨Åcation: (A) 100; (B, C, E, F, HYJ) 40. Scale bar = 10 Km. Green/FITC, Trpm4, or

and death relative to patients with diabetes who were managed without sulfonylurea agents (30,31). In a pilot study,
stroke patients treated with RP-1127 (glyburide formulated
for intravenous infusion) showed improved clinical outcomes
compared with historical controls (30). The current study
further supports the hypothesis that Sur1 coassociates with
Trpm4 to form functional Sur1-Trpm4 channels in human
cerebral ischemia and suggests that channel expression is associated with postischemic blood-brain barrier disruption and
neuroinÔ¨Çammation. Because a constitutive function of this
channel has not been identiÔ¨Åed in normal brain and because
both Abcc8 and Trpm4 knockout mice exhibit near-normal
phenotypes, pharmacologic inhibition of the Sur1-Trpm4
channel may represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy for patients sustaining focal cerebral infarction.
Because of an aging population, the absolute number of
stroke events is projected to increase in the next 2 decades
(32); thus, management of stroke patients remains a major
clinical challenge. Affected patients are at high risk for progressive neurologic deterioration and death caused by malignant cerebral edema. Although researchers have made
important progress in understanding the pathophysiology of
stroke in recent years, speciÔ¨Åc molecular mechanisms involved in postischemic cell death remain relatively ill deÔ¨Åned.
Elucidation of these mechanisms is necessary to optimize
outcomes for patients sustaining focal cerebral infarction. The
identiÔ¨Åcation of new pharmacotherapies with extended therapeutic time windows remains a critical goal in medicine. The
current study is limited to examination of cerebral infarcts
originating from stroke patients with poor outcome (i.e.
death). Nonetheless, in light of recent data (14Y16,22,33Y35),
these data suggest an important role for the Sur1-Trpm4
channel in the pathophysiology of postischemic cell death and
implicates pharmacologic blockade of the Sur1-Trpm4 channel as a possible novel therapeutic strategy for mitigating
neuronal loss and malignant cerebral edema in patients sustaining large territorial cerebral infarction.
