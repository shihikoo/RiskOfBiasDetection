BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
As a newer component of the renin–angiotensin system, angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang-(1–7) ] has been shown to facilitate
angiogenesis and protect against ischaemic damage in peripheral tissues. However, the role of Ang-(1–7) in brain
angiogenesis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Ang-(1–7) could promote angiogenesis in
brain, thus inducing tolerance against focal cerebral ischaemia.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were i.c.v. infused with Ang-(1–7), A-779 (a Mas receptor antagonist), L-NIO, a specific endothelial
NOS (eNOS) inhibitor, endostatin (an anti-angiogenic compound) or vehicle, alone or simultaneously, for 1–4 weeks. Capillary
density, endothelial cell proliferation and key components of eNOS pathway in the brain were evaluated. Afterwards, rats
were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), infarct
volume and neurological deficits were measured 24 h later.

KEY RESULTS
Infusion of Ang-(1–7) for 4 weeks significantly increased brain capillary density via promoting endothelial cell proliferation,
which was accompanied by eNOS activation and up-regulation of NO and VEGF in brain. These effects were abolished by
A-779 or L-NIO. More importantly, Ang-(1–7) improved rCBF and decreased infarct volume and neurological deficits after
pMCAO, which could be reversed by A-779, L-NIO or endostatin.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
This is the first evidence that Ang-(1–7) promotes brain angiogenesis via a Mas/eNOS-dependent pathway, which enhances
tolerance against subsequent cerebral ischaemia. These findings highlight brain Ang-(1–7)/Mas signalling as a potential target
in stroke prevention.

Ang-1–7 induces ischaemic tolerance by angiogenesis

Introduction
Ischaemic stroke is a major cause of human death and disability worldwide (Addo et al., 2012). To date, limited clinical
intervention is available to reduce brain damage after stroke
onset. In recent years, increasing attention has been focused
on development of preventive strategies, which is targeted to
ameliorate the impact of future stroke events by enhancement of ischaemic tolerance. Accumulating evidence suggests
that patients with stroke with a greater cerebral capillary
density have a better ischaemic tolerance than subjects with
lower capillary density (Krupinski et al., 1994). Meanwhile,
animal studies indicate that improvement of cerebral capillary density via therapeutic angiogenesis leads to a better
outcome after ischaemic insults (Li et al., 2008). The underlying mechanisms are that the increased brain capillary
density prevents reduction of regional cerebral blood flow
(rCBF) and maintains oxygen supply during cerebral ischaemia, thus ameliorating ischaemic brain damage (Wang et al.,
2005; Zechariah et al., 2013).
As a more recently identified bioactive peptide of the
renin–angiotensin system, angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang-(1–7) ] is
generated mainly from angiotensin II by ACE-2 and binds to
the GPCR Mas to exert its physiological functions (Santos
et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2011; Renno et al., 2012; receptor
nomenclature follows Alexander et al., 2013). Emerging evidence suggests a potential role of Ang-(1–7) in the process of
angiogenesis. In vitro, Chen et al. found that overexpression
of ACE2 led to an elevation of Ang-(1–7) levels, which subsequently improved the migration and tube formation of
endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) (Chen et al., 2013). In the
heart, endogenous Ang-(1–7) participated in angiogenesis,
facilitating cardiac repair and improving ventricular function
(Zhao et al., 2013). In addition to the heart, Ang-(1–7) and
Mas receptors are also present as endogenous constituents of
brain. However, the role of Ang-(1–7) in brain angiogenesis
remains elusive, thus far. Hence, the main purpose of the
present study was to investigate the effects of chronic
Ang-(1–7) infusion on angiogenesis in rat brain. For the first
time, we report that Ang-(1–7) promotes endothelial cell
proliferation and increases brain capillary density via a Mas/
endothelial NOS (eNOS)-dependent pathway. More importantly, we found that Ang-(1–7)-induced brain angiogenesis
attenuated the reduction of rCBF during subsequent ischaemia and resulted in improvement of stroke outcome.

individually ventilated cages at 20–24°C and relative humidity (30–70%) with a 12 h light/dark cycle, and given free
access to food and water.

Experimental groups
The rats were randomly allocated to eight experimental
groups using a random number table generated by the SPSS
software 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) as described (Jiang
et al., 2014a,b). For drug administration, rats were anaesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (3.5 mL·kg−1, i.p.), and placed
in a stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instrument Inc., Tujunga,
CA, USA). Implantation of osmotic pumps was performed
by surgeons who were unaware of the experimental
groups, as previously described (Jiang et al., 2012). Ang(1–7) (1.11 nmol·L−1; 0.25 μL·h−1), A-779 (1.14 nmol·L−1;
0.25 μL·h−1), L-NIO (10 μmol·L−1; 0.25 μL·h−1), endostatin
(0.6 mg·L−1; 0.25 μL·h−1) or aCSF was continuously infused
into the right lateral cerebral ventricle by osmotic pumps
until the animals were killed or subjected to permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO; for detailed
administration protocol, see Supporting Information Fig. S1).
During drug infusion, no signs of neurotoxicity or intracranial hypertension were observed in animals. The dose for
Ang-(1–7) (1.11 nmol·L−1) was chosen based on our previous
studies showing that Ang-(1–7) at this dose could effectively
activate the Mas/eNOS signalling pathway in brain (Zhang
et al., 2008). Meanwhile, the dose for A-779 (1.14 nmol·L−1)
was selected according our previous findings that A-779 at
this dose could effectively block most of the effects mediated
by Ang-(1–7) (1.11 nM) (Jiang et al., 2012; 2013b,c). The dose
for L-NIO and endostatin was determined according to
studies by Siamwala et al. (2013) and O’Reilly et al. (1997)
respectively.

BP measurement
BP of conscious rats was measured by a tail-cuff measurement
system (BP-2000; Visitech Systems Inc. Apex, NC, USA) once
a week by observers who were unaware of the experimental
groups, as previously described (Jiang et al., 2013b,c). Briefly,
unanaesthetized rats were placed in a holding device
mounted on a thermostatically controlled warming plate to
make the pulsations of the tail artery detectable. Tail cuffs
were fixed on animals, and animals were allowed to acclimate
to cuffs for 10 min prior to each pressure recording session.
Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured, and
mean BP (MAP) was automatically calculated using the following formula: MAP = (SBP + 2 × DBP) / 3.

Animals

Measurement of cerebral capillary density and
endothelial cell proliferation

All animal care and experimental procedures were approved
by the Animal Care and Management Committee of Qingdao
Municipal Hospital (Permit No. QMHEC-130427). All studies
involving animals are reported in accordance with the
ARRIVE guidelines for reporting experiments involving
animals (Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath et al., 2010;
Hooijmans et al., 2011). A total of 246 animals were used in
the experiments described here. Male Sprague-Dawley rats
(250–280 g, purchased from the Experimental Animals
Center of Nanjing Medical University) were maintained in

Cerebral capillary density was assessed by CD31 (an endothelial cell marker) immunofluorescence staining. Endothelial
cell proliferation was evaluated by double immunofluorescence staining with CD31 and 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine
(EdU), a marker for cell proliferation (Zeng et al., 2010). At 1,
2 or 4 weeks after infusion, some rats were received a single
injection of EdU (100 mg·kg−1), then were anaesthetized and
transcardially perfused with PBS (n = 6 per group). Afterwards,
the brains were removed and were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight. After dehydrated in alcohol, the

brains were embedded in paraffin and cut into 5 μm sections.
Sections were then incubated with a Cell-Light™ (Riobio Inc.,
Guangzhou, China) reaction cocktail for 30 min for EdU
staining. For labelling of CD31, the sections were then incubated with mouse anti-CD31 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) at
1:400 dilution in the blocking serum overnight at 4°C. After
washing, sections were incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h and sealed with a coverslip. The
slides were analysed with a fluorescence microscopy. Quantification of cerebral capillary density and endothelial cell proliferation was performed by observers who were unaware of
the experimental groups using a protocol described by
Zechariah et al. (2013). Briefly, three regions of interest (ROI)
at the size of 500 × 500 μm in the cerebral cortex were chosen
from three separate brain coronal sections (−0.8, −1.8 and
−2.8 mm from bregma). These areas were selected as ROIs
because they are directly perfused by the MCA, and pMCAO
will lead to the irreversible ischaemic damage in these areas
(Longa et al., 1989). More importantly, these areas play an
irreplaceable role in sensory and motor functions, and ischaemic damage within these areas is closely associated with
sensory and motor deficiency, the most apparent symptom of
ischaemic stroke (Harrison et al., 2013). The numbers of
CD31 + capillary as well as Edu + CD31 + capillary were
manually counted, and cerebral capillary density for each rat
was calculated as the mean of the capillary counts obtained
from the nine ROIs mentioned earlier. Meanwhile, endothelial cell proliferation was expressed as the percentage of Edu +
CD31 + capillary numbers in the nine ROIs mentioned earlier.
It should be noted that the data of vehicle group in Supporting Information Fig. S3 were produced in response to a
reviewer’s comment, and were therefore not contemporaneous with the data of the other two groups.

Assessment of Ang-(1–7), NO and
VEGF levels
For measurement of Ang-(1–7) levels, the rat brain was cut
into halves, and the cortex and hippocampus were homogenized separately. The concentration of Ang-(1–7) was
detected by a specific ELISA kits (S-1330; Bachem Inc., Torrance, CA, USA).
For assessment of NO and VEGF levels, the brain of each
rat was cut into halves and was homogenized. The NO level
was assessed by a colorimetric detection kit (Jiancheng Inc.,
Nanjing City, China) as described (Zhang et al., 2008). The
concentration of VEGF was measured by specific ELISA kits
(ab100786, Abcam Inc., Cambridge, UK) according to the
technical manuals provided by the manufacturers.

Western blot analysis
The brain of each rat was cut into halves and was homogenized. The total proteins were extracted by RIPA lysis buffer.
Samples were separated on SDS polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in 5% BSA
solution. Membranes were incubated overnight with primary
antibodies (Supporting Information Table S1). After washing,
membranes were then incubated with HRP-coupled secondary
antibody for another 2 h. Protein bands were detected with
chemiluminescent HRP substrate for 5 min. The band intensity was analysed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and normalized to β-actin.

pMCAO and rCBF measurement
At 4 weeks after infusion, some rats were anaesthetized with
10% chloral hydrate (3.5 mL·kg−1, i.p.) again. The depth of
anaesthesia was monitored by assessing the withdrawal reflex
to footpad pinching. pMCAO was performed by surgeons
who were unaware of the experimental groups, as previously
described (Jiang et al., 2012). Rats in the sham-operated group
were subjected to the filament insertion into the internal
carotid artery but with no reduction in rCBF. rCBF was determined in the core region (2 mm caudal to bregma and 6 mm
lateral to midline) and peripheral region (2 mm caudal to
bregma and 3 mm lateral to midline) of the MCA territory
before and after pMCAO by a laser-Doppler probe attached to
the thinned skull (Jiang et al., 2012). pMCAO induction was
considered successful if an >80% reduction in rCBF was
observed in the core region of MCA territory after occlusion.
During the pMCAO procedure, body temperature was maintained in the range of 37.0 ± 0.5°C with a heating pad until
rats were killed.

Infarct volume assessment and
neurobehavioural testing
At 24 h after pMCAO, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining was performed to assess the infarct volume by
investigators who were unaware of the experimental groups,
as previously described (Gao et al., 2012). The infarct volume
was evaluated by Image Pro-Plus 5.1 analysis system (Media
Cybernetics Inc., Rockville, MD, USA) using Swanson’s
method which corrects for oedema (Swanson et al., 1990).
Neurobehavioural tests were performed at 24 h after
pMCAO using a 5-point scale by an investigator who was
unaware of experimental groups, as previously described
(Jiang et al., 2012).

Data analysis
With the exception of neurological deficit, all data are
expressed as mean ± SD. Data were analysed with the SPSS
software 16.0 (SPSS Inc.). Statistically significant differences
were evaluated by an independent sample t-test or one-way
ANOVA followed by least significant difference post hoc test. For
neurological deficits, Mann–Whitney U-test was used for
comparisons between two groups. Power calculation was performed by STPLAN version 4.3 software (The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA). P <
0.05 was considered significant.

Materials
Ang-(1–7), A-779 (an antagonist of Mas receptors), N5-(1iminoethyl)-L-ornithine (L-NIO, a specific eNOS inhibitor)
and endostatin (an anti-angiogenic compound) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc. (St. Louis, MO, USA) and
were dissolved in an artificial CSF (aCSF).

Ang-(1–7) increased cerebral capillary density and promoted endothelial cell proliferation in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Rats were infused with
Ang-(1–7) for 1, 2 or 4 weeks, and the brain was removed and fixed. As indicated by the atlas on the top of this figure, three regions of interest
(ROIs; size 500 × 500 μm) in the cerebral cortex (indicated by red box) were chosen from three separate brain coronal sections (−0.8, −1.8 and

of EdU +/CD31 + cells in the ipsilateral hemisphere was also
markedly increased after 4 weeks infusion of Ang-(1–7) (21.3
± 4.3% vs. 6.9 ± 2.2%, Figure 1C). However, the capillary
density and percentage of EdU +/CD31 + cells in the contralateral hemisphere were not influenced by 4 weeks Ang-(1–7)
infusion (Figure 1B and D).

the ipsilateral hemisphere was increased by 1.9-fold after 4
weeks Ang-(1–7) infusion. Meanwhile, Ang-(1–7) also
induced an obvious increase in NO (1.5 ± 0.3 vs. 0.8 ±

0.2 μmol·g−1 protein) and VEGF (49.4 ± 8.3 vs. 19.5 ±
2.4 pg·mg−1 protein) levels in the ipsilateral hemisphere
(Figure 2C). However, the expression of nNOS and iNOS in
the ipsilateral hemisphere stayed unchanged after 4 weeks
infusion of Ang-(1–7) (Figure 2A). It should be noted that
Ang-(1–7) did not cause significant influence on aforementioned parameters in the contralateral hemisphere (Figure 2B
and D).
To determine whether Mas receptor was involved in
Ang-(1–7)-induced angiogenesis, rats were co-treated with
Ang-(1–7) and Mas antagonist A-779 for 4 weeks. A-779
co-treatment significantly reduced the Ang-(1–7)-induced
increase in ratio of p-eNOS (Ser1177)/eNOS as well as NO and
VEGF levels (Figure 3A and B). Besides, the Ang-(1–7)-induced

elevation in capillary density and EdU +/CD31 + cell percentage in brain was also abolished by A-779 (Figure 3C and D). It
should be noted that A-779 itself or in combination with
Ang-(1–7) did not significantly affect the parameters in both
hemispheres (Figure 3) mentioned earlier.
To further demonstrate the association of eNOS-mediated
signalling with Ang-(1–7)-induced angiogenesis, rats were
co-treated with Ang-(1–7) and L-NIO for 4 weeks. Cotreatment with L-NIO markedly inhibited the increase in
p-eNOS (Ser1177)/eNOS ratio (Figure 3A). Meanwhile, the Ang(1–7)-induced changes in NO and VEGF levels were also abolished by L-NIO (Figure 3B). More importantly, the Ang-(1–7)induced angiogenesis was attenuated by L-NIO, as the
capillary density and the percentage of EdU +/CD31 + cells in
the brain were blunted by L-NIO co-treatment (Figure 3C and
D). It is worthy to note that L-NIO alone or in combination
with Ang-(1–7) did not influence the parameters in both
hemispheres (Figure 3) mentioned earlier.

Ang-(1–7)-induced angiogenesis attenuated
the reduction of rCBF and improved stroke
outcome after pMCAO
After 4 weeks infusion of Ang-(1–7), rats were subjected to
pMCAO. This time-point was selected based on the observation mentioned earlier that 4 weeks infusion of Ang-(1–7)
significant promoted brain angiogenesis (Figure 1A).
A total of 10 rats died before completion of the experiment and were excluded from the study: one rat (8.3%) in
group 1, one rat (8.3%) in group 2, two rats in group 3
(16.7%), one rat in group 4 (8.3%), one rat in group 5 (8.3%),
two rats in group 6 (16.7%), one rat in group 7 (8.3%) and
one rat in group 8 (8.3%). Post-mortem examinations did not
reveal the occurrence of intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage in any of these animals, and no significant differences were found among mortality of each group.
During pMCAO, rCBF was measured in the core region
and peripheral region of the MCA territory. As demonstrated
by Figure 4A, rCBF immediately decreased to approximately
15% of the baseline in the core region and to approximately
47% in the peripheral region in vehicle-treated rats at the
onset of pMCAO, and continued for at least 24 h after
pMCAO. Ang-(1–7) infusion attenuated the reduction in rCBF
in the peripheral region after pMCAO (at 1 h after pMCAO:
58.8 ± 4% vs. 48.8 ± 5.2% of baseline, P < 0.05; at 24 h after
pMCAO: 58.5 ± 6.8% vs. 48.1 ± 6.3% of baseline, P < 0.05).
However, the reduction of rCBF in the core region of the MCA
territory after pMCAO was not significantly attenuated by
Ang-(1–7) (Figure 4B). At 24 h after pMCAO, TTC staining
and neurobehavioural testing were used to assess stroke
outcome. As shown in Figure 5A and B, chronic infusion of
Ang-(1–7) led to a significant reduction in infarct volume
(18.8 ± 2.9% vs. 26.4 ± 2.4% of the whole brain). Meanwhile,
an obvious amelioration in neurological deficits was observed
in Ang-(1–7)-infused rats (Figure 5C).
To examine the possibility that the improvement of rCBF
and stroke outcome were associated with Ang-(1–7)-induced
angiogenesis, rats were co-treated with an anti-angiogenic
compound endostatin, L-NIO or A-779 for 4 weeks before
pMCAO. The inhibition of endostatin on Ang-(1–7)-induced
increase in capillary density had been confirmed (Supporting
Information Fig. S3). As indicated by Figure 4, the Ang-(1–7)4228

Rats were co-treated with Ang-(1–7) and Mas receptor antagonist

was measured in the peripheral region (A) and core region (B) of the
MCA territory before and after pMCAO. Data are expressed as a
percentage of basal CBF in vehicle-treated rats. Data shown are

induced improvement in rCBF was fully reversed by endostatin, L-NIO or A-779. Meanwhile, the Ang-(1–7)-induced
reduction of infarct volume and neurologic deficits was partly
abolished by endostatin while L-NIO and A-779 completed
reversed the alterations in infarct volume and neurologic
deficits caused by Ang-(1–7) (Figure 5). It is worthy to note
that endostatin, L-NIO and A-779 alone did not alter infarct
volume or neurologic deficits (Figure 5).

Discussion
The major finding of this study is that infusion of Ang-(1–7)
for 4 weeks promoted brain angiogenesis via a Mas/eNOSdependent pathway, which attenuated the reduction of rCBF
and improved stroke outcome after pMCAO.

For the first time, we demonstrated that Ang-(1–7) promoted angiogenesis in brain, as an enhancement of endothelial cell proliferation and increased brain capillary density
were observed after 4 weeks infusion of Ang-(1–7). These
results were supported by earlier results from an in vitro study
in which overexpression of ACE2 improved EPC migration
and tube formation through elevating Ang-(1–7) levels (Chen
et al., 2013). Besides, more direct evidence has come from a
recent study by Zhao et al. that demonstrated that endogenous Ang-(1–7) facilitated angiogenesis via increased
endothelial cell proliferation in heart (Zhao et al., 2013).
However, in contrast to our findings, several lines of evidence
have suggested an anti-proliferative property of Ang-(1–7), as
it directly inhibited the growth of cancer cells such as
SK-LU-1, A549 and SKMES-1 cells in vitro (Passos-Silva et al.,
2013). This discrepancy might be ascribed to the differences
between cancer cells and endothelial cells in response to
Ang-(1–7).
We then investigated the underlying mechanisms by
which Ang-(1–7) promoted angiogenesis and found that Ang(1–7) infusion significantly enhanced eNOS activity and NO
generation in brain. Meanwhile, the level of VEGF, a main
downstream effector of eNOS, was also increased in brain
after Ang-(1–7) infusion. All these effects were abolished by
A-779, implying that eNOS was a downstream effector of
Ang-(1–7)/Mas signalling. These observations were compatible with a previous study in which Ang-(1–7) activated eNOS
by binding with Mas receptors in human aortic endothelial
cells (Sampaio et al., 2007). More recent studies have demon-

strated that brain eNOS activity was enhanced by overexpression of ACE2 or infusion of Ang-(1–7), which can be
suppressed by A-779, further indicating that Ang-(1–7) could
directly activate eNOS through Mas receptors in brain (Zhang
et al., 2008; Feng et al., 2010). To further elucidate the association between eNOS activation and Ang-(1–7)-induced
brain angiogenesis, a potent eNOS inhibitor L-NIO was used
in our experiments. As expected, the effects of Ang-(1–7) on
NO and VEGF were abolished by L-NIO. More importantly,
co-treatment with L-NIO completely reversed the proangiogenic effects of Ang-(1–7). These findings indicated that
Ang-(1–7) promoted angiogenesis in an eNOS-dependent
manner. As an important effector downstream of Ang-(1–7)/
Mas signalling, eNOS plays an irreplaceable role in angiogenesis. Pharmacological inhibition of eNOS was able to block
the formation of new vessels while eNOS-deficient mice
exhibited significant impairment in their angiogenic
response under pathological conditions (Zhang et al., 2003;
Gertz et al., 2006). In contrast, activation of eNOS could
enhance NO generation, which subsequently promoted
VEGF synthesis and facilitated the process of angiogenesis
(Namba et al., 2003; Thibeault et al., 2010).
Ang-(1–7) attenuated the reduction of rCBF in the peripheral region of MCA territory after pMCAO, an effect which
was abolished by A-779 or L-NIO. Meanwhile, we also found
that endostatin, an anti-angiogenic compound, could fully
reverse the Ang-(1–7)-induced improvement in rCBF, establishing a causal relation between Ang-(1–7)-induced angiogenesis and rCBF improvement. As a vasoactive peptide, it is

possible that Ang-(1–7) improved rCBF via other mechanisms, such as vasodilation of cerebral blood vessels.
However, in previous studies, we and others found that Ang(1–7) at the current dose (1.11 nM) did not induce vasodilatation in brain (Mecca et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2012). Hence,
it is unlikely that Ang-(1–7) improved rCBF through its vasodilatory effects in this model.
Accumulating evidence suggested that maintaining rCBF
after pMCAO is associated with a better stroke outcome, as
enhanced rCBF led to the improvement in blood and oxygen
supply, which stabilized cerebral energy state and reduced
neuronal damage in the peri-infarct regions (Li et al., 2008;
Zechariah et al., 2013). In this study, reduced infarct volume
and neurological deficits were observed in rats after Ang-(1–7)
infusion. Interestingly, the improved stroke outcome was
partly attenuated by endostatin and completely reversed by
A-779 and L-NIO. These findings indicated that promotion of
angiogenesis only represented part of the neuroprotective
mechanisms of Ang-(1–7). In other words, apart from its
pro-angiogenic actions, Ang-(1–7) may exert its neuroprotection through other Mas/eNOS-dependent mechanisms, such
as modulation of inflammatory response and oxidative stress
in brain (El-Hashim et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2012; 2013a;
Regenhardt et al., 2013a,b; Simoes e Silva et al., 2013;
Sumners et al., 2013).
Lastly, an interesting observation should be noted. In this
study, infusion of Ang-(1–7) into the right lateral cerebral
ventricle significantly increased the levels of this peptide in
the ipsilateral hemisphere, whereas the Ang-(1–7) levels in
the contralateral hemisphere were unchanged. Correspondingly, the Ang-(1–7)-induced angiogenesis was also limited
to the ipsilateral hemisphere. This phenomenon can be
explained as follows: first, as the right and left lateral cerebral
ventricles of Sprague-Dawley rats are not directly connected,
the solution infused into one lateral cerebral ventricle cannot
directly circulate into the other one. Second, although a solution infused into lateral cerebral ventricle will enter the CSF
circulation and become widely distributed within the subarachnoid space of the whole brain, it is unlikely that the
solution can penetrate the leptomeninges and diffuse into
the parenchyma of the contralateral hemisphere (Stroobants
et al., 2011; Zechariah et al., 2013). Therefore, it seems that
the only way that a solute delivered to one hemisphere can
pass to the other is by directly permeating through brain
parenchyma. This means that the concentration of this solute
will decrease with increasing distance from the infusion site.
This decrease will be particularly obvious during the infusion
of Ang-(1–7), as this solute is highly susceptible to cleavage by
proteases and peptidases and thus has a relatively short halflife in the brain (Silva-Barcellos et al., 2001). Considering
both these factors, diffusion distance and enzymic degradation, it is not surprising that the levels of Ang-(1–7) were not
significantly increased in the contralateral hemisphere after
infusion.
In conclusion, the present study provided the first evidence that infusion of Ang-(1–7) for 4 weeks promoted brain
angiogenesis in a Mas/eNOS-dependent manner. More
importantly, the Ang-(1–7)-induced angiogenesis attenuated
the reduction of rCBF and improved stroke outcome during a
subsequent ischaemic insult (Figure 6). These results demonstrate the role of Ang-(1–7) in brain angiogenesis and the

underlying mechanisms. Moreover, our findings highlight
brain Ang-(1–7)/Mas signalling as a potential target for prevention of ischaemic stroke. Further studies are warranted to
investigate whether Ang-(1–7) induces angiogenesis and thus
exerts beneficial effects on brain plasticity and long-term
sensorimotor recovery after an ischaemic stroke.
