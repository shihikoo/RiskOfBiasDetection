Post-ischemic hyperglycemia exacerbates the development of cerebral ischemia. To elucidate this
exacerbation mechanism, we focused on sodium–glucose transporter (SGLT) as a mediator that lead
hyperglycemia to cerebral ischemia. SGLT transport glucose into the cell, together with sodium ion, using
the sodium concentration gradient. We have previously reported that suppression of cerebral SGLT ameliorates cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. However, detail relationship cerebral between SGLT and
post-ischemic hyperglycemia remain incompletely deﬁned. Therefore, we examined the involvement
of cerebral SGLT on cerebral ischemic neuronal damage with or without hyperglycemic condition. Cell
survival rate of primary cultured neurons was assessed by biochemical assay. A mouse model of focal
ischemia was generated using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neuronal damage was assessed
with histological and behavioral analyses. Concomitant hydrogen peroxide/glucose treatment exacerbated hydrogen peroxide alone-induced cell death. Although a SGLT family-speciﬁc inhibitor, phlorizin
had no effect on developed hydrogen peroxide alone-induced cell death, it suppressed cell death induced
by concomitant hydrogen peroxide/glucose treatment. ␣-MG induced a concentration-dependent and
signiﬁcant decrease in neuronal survival. PHZ administered on immediately after reperfusion had no
effect, but PHZ given at 6 h after reperfusion had an effect. Our in vitro study indicates that SGLT is not
involved in neuronal cell death in non-hyperglycemic condition. We have already reported that postischemic hyperglycemia begins to develop at 6 h after MCAO. Therefore, current our in vivo study show
post-ischemic hyperglycemic condition may be necessary for the SGLT-mediated exacerbation of cerebral
ischemic neuronal damage.

Cerebral ischemia is the second common cause of death and
the primary cause of disability throughout the world [1]. Diabetes,
hypertension, and cardiac disease are well-known risk factors for
cerebral ischemia [2,3]. Diabetes in particular is an established risk
factor for cerebral ischemia that increases the incidence rate and
exacerbates brain injury [1,2,4]. On the other hand, some patients
experience hyperglycemia induced by cerebral ischemia even in
the absence of a preexisting diagnosis of diabetes, a condition called

post-ischemic hyperglycemia [5]. Post-ischemic hyperglycemia is
associated with increased mortality and poor recovery in diabetic
and non-diabetic patients after cerebral ischemia [6,7]. Normalization of blood glucose after cerebral ischemia improves the
prognosis for patients [8]. We previously reported that fasting
blood glucose (FBG) levels begin to elevate at 6 h and maximize on day 1 after focal cerebral ischemia in mice [9]. We also
found that regulation of post-ischemic hyperglycemia used antidiabetic drugs, such as insulin and metformin, ameliorates cerebral
ischemic neuronal damage [9,10]. However, the mechanism underlying the post-ischemic hyperglycemia-induced exacerbation of
cerebral ischemic neuronal damage remains unknown. Therefore,
we focused on the sodium–glucose transporter (SGLT) as a potential
mediator causing hyperglycemia to exacerbate cerebral ischemic
neuronal damage.
The SGLT transports glucose into cells through a secondary
active transport mechanism that uses the sodium concentration
gradient [11,12]. The SGLT family directly causes membrane depolarization and increases electrical activity without the need for
glucose metabolism [13]. Interestingly, we have previously found
that suppression of the cerebral SGLT soon after ischemic stress
used a SGLT family-speciﬁc inhibitor, phlorizin (PHZ), ameliorates cerebral ischemic neuronal damage in animal models of
focal or global cerebral ischemia [14,15]. These data suggested
that the cerebral SGLT may exacerbate cerebral ischemia and that
inhibition of the cerebral SGLT may be a promising novel therapeutic strategy. However, detail relationship cerebral SGLT and
post-ischemic hyperglycemia remain incompletely deﬁned. In particular, although PHZ twice treatment at immediately and 6 h after
ischemic stress improved cerebral ischemic neuronal damage as
our previous report, post-ischemic hyperglycemia does not occur
within 6 h after cerebral ischemia [9,14]. Therefore, we conﬁrmed
that the involvement of cerebral SGLT on cerebral ischemic neuronal damage with or without hyperglycemic condition.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Animals
Experiments were performed on the 18th days of fetal life ddY
mice for culture experiments and 5 weeks old male ddY mice
(25–30 g) for in vivo experiments, which were purchased from
SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). Animals were housed at a temperature of
23–24 ◦ C under a 12 h light–dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. The present study was conducted in accordance
with the Guiding Principles for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, adopted by the Japanese Pharmacological Society. Additionally, all experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee
for Animals, Kobe Gakuin University (approval number: A14-21).

with poly-d-ornithine (100 ␮g/mL; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA). Cytosine ␤-d-arabinofuranoside (0.1 ␮M; Sigma–Aldrich)
was added to cultures on the second day after seeding (second day
in vitro [DIV 2]) to inhibit the proliferation of non-neuronal cells.
In this culture preparation, >90% of cells are neurons [16]. Cortical
neurons were cultured for 5 days (DIV 5) before reagents treatment.
2.3. Determination of survival rate
Cortical neurons were exposed to oxidative stress by addition
of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2; 50, 100, or 200 ␮M; Santoku Chemical Industries Co, Tokyo, Japan). To assess neuronal death, cortical
neurons were exposed to additional glucose (8.75, 17.5, or 70 mM;
Nacalai Tesque) or mannitol (77 mM; Nacalai Tesque), alphad-methylglucoside (␣-MG; 0.1, 1, 10, 100 ␮M; Tokyo Chemical
Industry, Tokyo, Japan) into the culture media with or without PHZ
(0.5, 5, 50, or 500 ␮M; Tokyo Chemical Industry). Cell survival rates
were estimated using the WST-8 [2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] (Nacalai
Tesque) reduction assay (Dojindo, Tokyo, Japan) on 24 h after
reagents treatment.
2.4. Animal model of focal cerebral ischemia
The experimental mouse model of transient focal ischemia
was generated by performing a middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) as previously described [9]. Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized
with isoﬂurane. The left middle cerebral artery was occluded for 2 h
by the insertion of an 8–0 nylon monoﬁlament with a thin silicon
coat (Provil Novo Medium; Heraeus Kulzer, Hanau, Germany), followed by reperfusion. Sham-operated mice underwent the same
surgical procedure but without the suture insertion. We eliminated mice from the study that had been inadvertently pricked
on their brains with the silicon-coated 8–0 nylon monoﬁlament
or that showed unsuccessful infarction on day 3 after the MCAO.
The ﬁnal number of mice used in each experiment is described in
the appropriate ﬁgure legend.
2.5. Administration of PHZ
Mice were administered an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of PHZ (40 ␮g/mouse) (Tokyo Chemical Industry) or vehicle at
immediately, 6 and 12 h after reperfusion. Tubing covered all but
the terminal 2.5–3.0 mm of the needle to create a track through the
brain and into, but not through, the ﬂoor of the lateral ventricle
[17]. The needle was inserted unilaterally into the lateral ventricle
of the brain (1.0 mm lateral and 1.0 mm posterior to bregma) as
previously described [18]. The needle position in the lateral cerebroventricular region was veriﬁed with an i.c.v. injection of dye and
subsequent postmortem brain section conﬁrmation of dye placement.

2.2. Primary cortical neuronal cultures
2.6. Measurement of FBG levels
Cortical neurons were prepared from fetuses obtained from 17th
days pregnant ddY mice, as modiﬁed from previously described
[16]. Brieﬂy, dissociated cortical neurons were plated in 96well plates, for survival experiments, or in 6-well plates, for
western blot analysis, at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/cm2 . Cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s Medium/Ham’s F-12
(with l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan).
The medium was supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated bovine
serum (Biowest, Nuaillé, France), 5% heat-inactivated horse serum
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin (Invitrogen),
and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen), and maintained in a
humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 ◦ C. Plates were coated

Mice were fasted for 15 h to measure FBG levels, and blood samples (up to 1.5 ␮L) were obtained from their tail veins. Plasma FBG
was measured using a Glucose Pilot (Aventir Biotech, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). The change in FBG levels was calculated as previously
described [9] using the following formula: FBG level change = FBG
after MCAO − FBG before MCAO (pre-MCAO FBG). Pre-MCAO FBG
was measured 48–96 h before the MCAO.
2.7. Measurement of infarct volume
Mice were killed and their brains were immediately dissected
on day 3 after the MCAO. The brains were cut into 2-mm-thick

136

coronal slices. The brain slices were incubated in saline containing 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma–Aldrich)
for 10 min at 37 ◦ C. The stained slices were then ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde (Sigma–Aldrich), and the infarct volumes were
measured using image analysis software (ImageJ) (NIH, Bethesda,
MD, USA) and Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0 (Adobe Systems
Incorporated, Tokyo, Japan). The infarct volume was calculated
based on infarct area and intensity (intensity = intensity of left
hemisphere − intensity of right hemisphere).
2.8. Neurological examination
Neurological examination was performed on day 3 after MCAO
using the neurological deﬁcit score (NDS), which comprised consciousness (0, normal; 1, restless; 2, lethargic; 3, stuporous; 4,
seizures; 5, death), walking (0, normal; 1, paw; 2, unbalanced
walking; 3, circling; 4, unable to stand; 5, no movement), limb
tone (0, normal; 1, spastic; 2, ﬂaccid), and pain reﬂex [9]. Pain
reﬂex was assessed using the tail-ﬂick test (pain reﬂex = latency
after MCAO − latency before MCAO). The difference in latency was
reﬂected in the NDS. A cutoff time of 10 s was used to prevent any
injury to the tail.
2.9. Statistical analysis
WST-8 reduction was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test. FBG levels and infarct
volume were analyzed using ANOVA followed by Scheffe’s post hoc
tests. These data are presented as mean ± SEM. The NDS was analyzed using the Steel–Dwass test with the post hoc nonparametric
multiple comparison test, and the data are presented as medians
(25–75th percentile). Normality and equal variance tests were performed for all data before the post hoc tests. Values of P < 0.05 were
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Effect of PHZ on H2 O2 -induced cell neuronal death
Neuronal survival was dependent on the concentration of
hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ); 50, 100 and 200 ␮M H2 O2 decreased
neuronal survival compared to controls without H2 O2 treatment
(Fig. 1A). In addition, 100 ␮M H2 O2 decreased survival in a time
dependent manner, with signiﬁcant reductions recorded between
at 3 and 24 h after treatment (Fig. 1B). No concentration of PHZ was
able to rescue the decline of neuronal survival induced by 100 ␮M
H2 O2 (Fig. 1C).
3.2. PHZ reduced glucose-induced and H2 O2 /glucose-induced
neuronal cell death
Glucose induced a concentration-dependent decrease in neuronal survival; +17.5 and +70 mM glucose signiﬁcantly reduced
neuronal survival compared to controls without glucose (Fig. 2A).
Mannitol treatment had no effect on survival rate (Fig. 2A). PHZ
treatment suppressed the decline in survival induced by +17.5 mM
glucose in a concentration-dependent manner, with 5 ␮M PHZ
signiﬁcantly improving neuronal survival (Fig. 2B). Addition of
+8.75 mM glucose with 100 ␮M H2 O2 exacerbated the reduction
in neuronal survival rate induced by 100 ␮M H2 O2 alone (Fig. 2C).
The increase in cell death after concomitant treatment with H2 O2
and glucose was signiﬁcantly suppressed by 5 ␮M PHZ (Fig. 2C). ␣MG induced a concentration-dependent and signiﬁcant decrease in
neuronal survival (Fig. 2D).

3.3. Time dependently effect of PHZ on cerebral ischemic
neuronal damage
FBG levels were signiﬁcantly increased on day 1 after the
MCAO compared with the sham group and were unaffected by
PHZ administration (Fig. 3A). The infarct volume and neurological
abnormalities assessed on day 3 after the MCAO were unaffected
in the group of mice receiving PHZ on immediately and 12 h after
reperfusion compared with those in the vehicle-treated group
(Fig. 3B–D). However, PHZ administered to mice at 6 h after reperfusion suppressed neurological abnormalities and reduced the
infarct volume compared with those in the vehicle-treated group
(Fig. 3B–D).

4. Discussion
The normalization of blood glucose after cerebral ischemia is of
great prognostic signiﬁcance in patients. We previously reported
that suppression of post-ischemic hyperglycemia ameliorates cerebral ischemic neuronal damage [9,18]. Therefore, we focused on
SGLT as a possible mediator between cerebral ischemic neuronal
damage and hyperglycemia.
We previously demonstrated that cerebral SGLT exacerbates the
development of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. An overload of
Ca2+ induces excitotoxicity and development of cerebral ischemic
neuronal damage [19]. This excessive inﬂux of Ca2+ into the cell
is mediated by glutamate receptors, such as N-methyl-d-aspartate
and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid,
and by voltage-dependent calcium channels [20]. SGLT may induce
excessive depolarization of neuronal membranes in response to
post-ischemic hyperglycemia, resulting in marked inﬂuxes of glucose and Na+ . This depolarization may lead to glutamate release
and voltage-dependent calcium channels opening. Hyperglycemia
increases reactive oxygen species production and induces cell toxicity and apoptosis [21]. Hyperglycemia also induces apoptosis
via modulation of protein kinase C␤I and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate [22]. Sorbitol, as one of glucose metabolite, results mitochondrial death cascade through increment of
MAPK signaling levels [23]. During ischemia, anaerobic metabolism
of glucose and the formation of lactate lead to exacerbation of
cerebral ischemia [24]. That is, post-ischemic hyperglycemia may
induce excess transportation of glucose by SGLT together with
Na+ and may induce apoptosis. However, involvement of cerebral
SGLT without post-ischemic hyperglycemia condition in cerebral
ischemic neuronal damage is not clear. Therefore, we examined
effect of cerebral SGLT on the neuronal damage with or without of
hyperglycemic condition. In addition, we conﬁrmed the involvement of excessive inﬂux of Na+ through SGLT in the neuronal
damage using ␣-MG which is non-metabolic glucose analog and
substrate of SGLT [25].
In the present study, primary cortical neurons were exposed
100 ␮M H2 O2 for 24 h, which induced reasonable neuronal cell
death. PHZ had no effect on the H2 O2 alone-induced decrease in
neuronal survival, unexpectedly suggesting that neuronal SGLT
might not be directly involved with oxidative stress-mediated neuronal cell death. Here, as previous reports, high concentrations
of glucose have been reported to induce neuronal cell death, as
shown by a reduction in WST-8 activity [26], as well as early
decreases in cell viability and an increase in apoptosis [27]. We
demonstrated that our high glucose conditions also decreased
cell survival rate. Remarkably, high glucose condition may induce
neuronal cell death mediated by neuronal SGLT. Next, we used
additional glucose treatment to conﬁrm the effect of glucose on
H2 O2 -induced neuronal cell death, which mimics the phenomenon
of post-ischemic hyperglycemia. We used 8.75 mM glucose treat-

MG. The results suggested that involvement of Na+ inﬂux mediated
by SGLT in the neuronal cell death.
We previously found that inhibition of the cerebral SGLT family
using PHZ administered i.c.v. twice (at immediately and 6 h after
reperfusion) ameliorates neuronal damage [14]. We hypothesized
that post-ischemic hyperglycemia which begins to develop at 6 h
after MCAO exacerbate cerebral ischemic neuronal damage mediated by cerebral SGLT. Hence, we conﬁrmed effect of PHZ treatment
which is divisible three time points. First time point is at immediately after reperfusion treatment which means non-hyperglycemic
condition [9]. Second time point is at 6 h after reperfusion treatment
as beginning to increase of FBG after MCAO [9]. Third time point
is at 12 h after reperfusion treatment which signiﬁcantly increase
FBG after MCAO [9]. Accordingly, PHZ administered at immediately
after reperfusion had no effect, but PHZ given at 6 h after reperfusion had an effect. Just like our current in vitro study, cerebral SGLT
may respond to this elevation in blood glucose levels and exacerbate cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. Furthermore, PHZ at 12 h
after reperfusion treatment did not improve the neuronal damage.
It may be important period for improvement by inhibition of cerebral SGLT that begins to increase FBG. PHZ at 12 h after reperfusion
treatment is too late for beneﬁcial outcome. These results suggested

that apoptosis signal enhanced by cerebral SGLT is triggered from
6 h to 12 h after reperfusion.
SGLT-1, 3, 4 and 6 have been identiﬁed in the brain [12,14,28,29].
In current study, involvement of each SGLT isoform in the exacerbation of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage remain incompletely
understood. We have previously reported that the activation of
cerebral SGLT-3 by post-ischemic hyperglycemia may suppress the
development of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage [29]. Therefore, other cerebral SGLT isoforms, such as SGLT-1, -4, -6 may
be involved in the exacerbation of cerebral ischemia. In particular, cerebral SGLT-1 was dramatically increased after MCAO in our
report [14]. In the future, it may be necessary to conﬁrm involvement of each cerebral SGLT isoform such as SGLT-1 in cerebral
ischemia.
5. Conclusion
We demonstrate that cerebral SGLT may exacerbate the development of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. Hyperglycemic
condition may be necessary for the SGLT-mediated exacerbation.
Our results suggest that neuronal SGLT may be one of the novel
targets for clinical treatment of cerebral stroke.
