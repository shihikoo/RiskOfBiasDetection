Abstract
Thymosin beta 4 (Tb4), a secreted 43 amino acid peptide,
promotes oligodendrogenesis, and improves neurological
outcome in rat models of neurologic injury. We demonstrated that exogenous Tb4 treatment up-regulated the
expression of the miR-200a in vitro in rat brain progenitor
cells and in vivo in the peri-infarct area of rats subjected to
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The up-regulation
of miR-200a down-regulated the expression of the following
targets in vitro and in vivo models: (i) growth factor receptorbound protein 2 (Grb2), an adaptor protein involved in
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Grb2/Ras/MEK/
ERK1/c-Jun signaling pathway, which negatively regulates
the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP), a marker of
mature oligodendrocyte; (ii) ERRFI-1/Mig-6, an endogenous
potent kinase inhibitor of EGFR, which resulted in activation/
phosphorylation of EGFR; (iii) friend of GATA 2, and

phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome
10 (PTEN), which are potent inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway, and resulted
in marked activation of AKT; and (iv) transcription factor,
p53, which induces pro-apoptotic genes, and possibly
reduced apoptosis of the progenitor cells subjected to
oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). Anti-miR-200a transfection reversed all the effects of Tb4 treatment in vitro. Thus,
Tb4 up-regulated MBP synthesis, and inhibited OGDinduced apoptosis in a novel miR-200a dependent EGFR
signaling pathway. Our ﬁndings of miR-200a-mediated protection of progenitor cells may provide a new therapeutic
importance for the treatment of neurologic injury.

Thymosin b4 (Tb4) is a secreted 43-amino acid G-actin
sequestering peptide (Goldstein et al. 1966) which regulates
the cellular actin-cytoskeleton and cell migration (Sanders
et al. 1992; Huff et al. 2001). Tb4 has multiple biologic
functions including inhibiting inﬂammation and promoting
regeneration in both dermal and cardiac injury models
(Goldstein et al. 2005). In addition, Tb4 induces differentiation of oligoprogenitor cells (OPC) into mature myelin
secreting oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo in experimental animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS), embolic
stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) (Zhang et al. 2009;
Morris et al. 2010a; Xiong et al. 2010; Santra et al. 2012,
2014). In all three animal models, Tb4 treatment improves
functional outcome. This improvement may in-part be
attributed to migration of OPCs toward the site of injury

and the differentiation of OPCs which remyelinates injured
axons (Jiang et al. 2006; Menn et al. 2006; Aguirre et al.
2007; Morris et al. 2010a; Zhang et al. 2010a,b, 2013a,b).

Thymosin beta 4 up-regulates miR-200a

multiple molecular mechanisms during the recovery phase of
neurologic injury. These molecular mechanisms are involved
in remodeling of the injured brain via angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and axonal and dendritic plasticity, and thereby
enhance neurologic recovery (Zhang and Chopp 2009;
Morris et al. 2010b). To aid in the translation of
neurorestorative therapies to the clinical for stroke, it is
important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that
regulate neurologic recovery.
The adult subventricular zone (SVZ) normally produces
neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) and OPCs. Stroke increases
production of newborn NPCs and OPCs of which very few
survive (Arvidsson et al. 2002; Zhang et al. 2013b).
Increasing the survival of newborn NPCs and OPCs, and
their differentiation into neurons and oligodendrocytes,
respectively, may be a therapeutic approach for the treatment
of diseases associated with ischemic brain injuries. Increasing evidence suggests that the microRNAs (e.g., miR-200,
124a, 133b, 17–92 cluster, 29a, and 146a) regulate proliferation and differentiation of adult NPCs and OPCs (Lee
et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2011, 2013a,b; Rink and K. 2011;
Ouyang et al. 2013, 2014; Xin et al. 2013; Zhang et al.
2013c; Santra et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014). Based on
Agilent Mouse microRNA Microarray analysis of ischemic
mouse brain tissue samples, the miR-200 family (miR-200a,
miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429) members
(miR-200) show the best neuroprotective effect against
oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) among the microRNAs
(Lee et al. 2010). In addition, NPCs undergo apoptosis in the
absence of miR-200 in mouse and zebra ﬁsh brain (Choi
et al. 2008).
Our previous data demonstrated that Tb4 treatment
induces myelin basic protein (MBP) synthesis, and differentiation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes, by up-regulating
p38 MAPK in the cells isolated from the SVZ, and in a
miR-146a dependent pathway in an OPC cell line-N20.1a
and primary OPCs (Santra et al. 2012, 2014). Enhanced
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling induces
remyelination of axons of injured neurons, and increases
migration of newly generated NPCs from the SVZ to the
olfactory bulb (OB) via the rostral migratory stream
(Aguirre et al. 2005, 2007; Adam et al. 2009). The miR200 family members are highly expressed in the OB and are
required for terminal differentiation of NPCs (Choi et al.
2008). The miR-200 not only induces terminal differentiation of NPCs in the OB, but also induces neuronal
differentiation in neuronal stem cells and in a PC-12 cell
line (Pandey et al. 2015). Based on TargetScan analysis
(http://www.mirbase.org), we identiﬁed multiple target
sequences for the miR-200 in adaptor and mediators of
the EGFR signaling, e.g., Mig-6/ERRFI-1, growth factor
receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), friend of GATA 2
(FOG2), phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in chromosome 10 (PTEN). We therefore sought to investigate the

119

effect of Tb4 treatment on miR-200 in the regulation of
EGFR expression, and EGFR signaling.
In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of
Tb4-mediated differentiation of OPCs into myelinating
mature oligodendrocytes and their protection from OGDmediated apoptosis. We found that Tb4-enhanced EGFR
signaling in a miR-200a dependent pathway in progenitor
cells. Tb4 treatment (in vitro and in vivo) up-regulated
miR-200a, and down-regulated the known targets of miR200a, e.g., ERRFI-1/Mig-6, Grb2, FOG2, PTEN, and p53,
which were involved in MBP synthesis, AKT activation, cell
survival, and protection of progenitor cells from OGDinduced cell death. Up-regulation of miR-200a after Tb4
treatment induced oligodendrogenesis in a cell culture model
under condition of OGD. Our ﬁndings of an important role of
miR-200a in mediating progenitor cell and oligodendrocyte
protection may provide a new therapeutic target for the
treatment of neurologic injury.

Materials and methods
All animal experiments were performed according to protocols
approved by the Henry Ford Hospital Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion
Male Wistar rats (300–400 g) purchased from Charles River
Breeding Company (Wilmington, MA, USA), were anesthetized
with 1.0–2.0% isoﬂurane in 70% N2O and 30% O2 using a face
mask. Right MCAO was performed according to a modiﬁed
protocol of intraluminal vascular occlusion established in our
laboratory (Santra et al. 2006a,b).
Isolation of neuroprogenitor cells from SVZ
The SVZ of the adult male Wistar rat (Charles river Breeding
company), was examined under a microscope (Olympus BX40;
Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) and was surgically dissected
according to methods previously described (Santra et al. 2006a,b).
SVZ cells were dissociated and cultured in neurosphere growth
medium containing EGF and basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (20 ng/
mL), as previously described (Santra et al. 2006a,b). The generated neurospheres were passed by mechanical dissociation and
reseeded as single cells at a density of 104 cells/cm2 in EGFcontaining media. Passage 2 and 3 neurospheres were used in this
study.
Preparation of primary rat embryonic oligodendrocyte progenitor
cells
Primary rat embryonic oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were
isolated and prepared according to the method of Chen et al.
(2007). Brieﬂy, on embryonic day 17, the rat embryos were
removed from a pregnant Wistar rat in a laminar ﬂow hood. The
cortices were dissected and dissociated with 0.01% trypsin and
DNase at 37°C for 15 min followed by platting with Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle’s medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum in
poly-D-lysine coated T75 cell culture ﬂasks (~ 107/ﬂask) for 10 days.

M. Santra et al.

These conﬂuent cells were shaken at 200 rpm at 37°C for 1 h to
remove microglial cells in the medium and further shaken at
200 rpm at 37°C for 12 h to collect OPCs in the medium. The
collected OPCs from medium were cultured in poly-D, L-ornithinecoated Petri dishes at a cell density of 104 per/cm2 with OPC
medium containing platelet derived growth factor and basic
ﬁbroblast growth factor (10 ng/mL).
Tb4 treatment
The cells (102 cells/cm2) were treated with 0, 25, or 50 ng/mL of
Tb4 (RegeneRx Biopharmaceuticals Inc, Rockville, MD, USA) for
7 days. For the treatment with kinase inhibitors, the cells were pretreated EGFR speciﬁc inhibitor-AG-1478 at the dose of 1–3 nM
(Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) for 20–30 min before the
addition of Tb4 into the medium, as previously described
(Moscatello et al. 1998). For in vivo treatment in rats, Tb4
(12 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 24 h after MCAO. The
injection was continued every 3 days for four additional doses
(12 mg/kg), as previously reported (Morris et al. 2014).
Transfection
The cells (106) were mixed with 1 lg plasmid DNA or 100 pmol of
siRNA/oligo nucleotides and pulsed according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The transfected cells were immediately plated
into Petri dishes with Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
containing 1% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37°C for
2 days. A random mixture of oligonucleotides (Ambion, Grand
Island, NY, USA) was used as a scrambled oligo control (Izadi
et al. 2007) for both transfections with Tb4siRNA (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and anti-miRTM miRNA inhibitors for miR-200a, -200b, -200c, -429, and -141 (Applied Biosystem, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were transfected with the
anti-miRTM miRNA inhibitors for miR-200a, -200b, -200c, -429,
and -141 according to manufacturer’s protocol (Applied Biosystem)
in order to knock-down the expression of miR-200a, -200b, -200c, 429, and -141. The control lentiviral vector without insert was used
as a mock transfected control for miR-200 expression vector
transfection. In order to over-express miR-200, the cells were
transfected with lentiviral vector of miR-200 cluster genes, e.g.,
Lenti-miR-200b-200a-429 and Lenti-miR-200c-141 (addgene;
Cambridge, MA, USA), as previously reported (Gregory et al.
2008; Santra et al. 2008).
Quantification of mature miRNAs by real-time qrtPCR
The cDNA for each miRNA and TaqMan assay were performed in
triplicate according to the manufacturer’s protocol speciﬁed in
Applied Biosystems ViiATM 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystem), as previously described (Santra et al. 2014). Brieﬂy,
total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA).
The microRNA cDNA was performed by individual reverse
transcription in the following thermal cycle 16°C for 30 min,
42°C for 30 min, 85°C for 5 min, and then held at 4°C for TaqMan
assays. TaqMan assay was performed in 20 lL TaqMan real-time
PCR reactions. All values were normalized to U6 snRNA TaqMan
miRNA control assay (Applied Biosystem), as the endogenous
control. Values obtained from three independent experiments were
analyzed relative to gene expression data using the 2ΔΔCT method
(Livak and Schmittgen 2001).

Quantitative analysis of western blot
Total protein extracts from the cells were prepared, as previously
described (Santra et al. 2011). The protein extracts were separated
by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for
western blot analysis. For western blot analysis, rabbit antiserum for
MBP (1 : 200; Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA), monoclonal antibodies (1 : 500) for EGFR and phosphorylated EGFR; monoclonal
antibodies (1 : 1000) for phosphorylated ERK1, c-JUN, and FOG2
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit polyclonal antibodies (1 : 500)
for Grb2, Mig-6, Pten, p53 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danver,
MA, USA), and mouse monoclonal a-tubulin antibodies (1 : 5000;
Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) were used. Donkey anti-goat, antirabbit, and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1 : 5000; Jackson
ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, PA, USA) were used as
secondary antibodies. Each experiment was repeated at least ﬁve
times. The protein bands were quantiﬁed based on histogram
analysis relative to gel loading marker a-tubulin at least ﬁve
independent experiments.
Statistical analysis
Data were summarized using mean and standard deviation. To
compare the differences between cell cultures with Tb4 treatment
and without, a one-sample t-test or a two-sample t-test was used. For
the comparisons of qrtPCR of mRNA/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and qrtPCR of miRNA/U6, controls were
normalized to 1, so that one-sample t-test was used for analysis. To
compare the percentage of positive stained cells out of the total
number of cells between Tb4 treatment and control, a two-sample ttest was used. p-value < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Results
To examine cell survival of newborn SVZ progenitor cells
after stroke, we isolated and cultured progenitor cells as
neurospheres from the SVZ of adult rats, subjected to
MCAO for 7 days. Since MCAO stimulates newly generated progenitor cells which are vulnerable to ischemic
insults (Zhang et al. 2001, 2004a,b, 2010b, 2011, 2012,
2013b; Arvidsson et al. 2002), we utilized these progenitor
cells (cultured as neurospheres) from the SVZ of adult
rats, subjected to MCAO for 7 days in all the following
experiments. Additionally, normal rat embryonic primary
OPCs (Santra et al. 2012, 2014) were also employed to
determine OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes and
their survival from OGD in subsequent experiments. We
sought to investigate whether Tb4 treatment protects
newly generated SVZ progenitor cells from OGD insult
and the molecular mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection.

EGFR signaling is required for MBP synthesis and OPC
differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes
To determine the involvement of EGFR signaling in OPC
differentiation into mature oligodendrocyte, EGFR signaling
was blocked by tyrphostin AG-1478, a speciﬁc pharmaceutical inhibitor of EGFR kinase (Moscatello et al. 1998). To
examine Tb4-mediated OPC differentiation, a potent marker
of mature oligodendrocyte, MBP was measured (Santra et al.

embryonic OPCs were isolated from the embryos of pregnant
Wistar rats (n = 5). These neurospheres and OPCs were
treated with 0, 25, 50 and 100 ng/mL Tb4 for 7 days in ﬁve
independent experiments. The qrtPCR and western blot data
revealed that Tb4 treatment signiﬁcantly up-regulated EGFR
expression and its phosphorylation at mRNA and protein
levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a and Figure S1a
and b). These data demonstrated that Tb4 treatment induced
EGFR signaling. Since EGFR signaling enhances OPC
differentiation into mature oligodendrocyte (Doetsch et al.
2002; Aguirre and G. 2007; Aguirre et al. 2007, 2010;
Scaﬁdi et al. 2014), we investigated whether EGFR

after the treatment with 50 ng/mL Tb4 with/without AG1478 for 7 days. The qrtPCR and western blot data revealed
that Tb4 treatment markedly up-regulated mRNA and
protein levels of MBP. In contrast, AG-1478 treatment
reversed this Tb4 effect on up-regulation of MBP (Fig. 1b).
Since AG-1478 is a speciﬁc inhibitor of EGFR kinase
(Moscatello et al. 1998), AG-1478-induced inhibition of
MBP synthesis indicated that EGFR signaling was required
for Tb4-mediated MBP synthesis. In addition to the pharmaceutical inhibitor, AG-1478, the endogenous cytoplasmic
protein, Mig-6/ERRFI-1/Gene-33, speciﬁcally inhibits EGFR
kinase (Xu et al. 2005, 2006; Zhang et al. 2007; Descot
et al. 2009). To examine molecular mechanism of Tb4mediated EGFR signaling, we therefore investigated the
expression of Mig-6 after Tb4 treatment.
Tb4 treatment down-regulates Mig-6 expression in rat SVZ
progenitor cells and OPCs
To determine the effect of Tb4 treatment on the expression
of Mig-6, rat SVZ-neurospheres and OPCs were treated
with Tb4 at the dose of 0, 25, 50, and 100 ng/mL for
7 days. The qrtPCR and western blot revealed that Tb4
treatment down-regulated Mig-6 expression in a dosedependent manner at mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1c).
To determine whether Mig-6 expression regulates EGFR
phosphorylation and MBP expression, we transfected rat
SVZ-neurospheres and OPCs with Mig-6siRNA. The
transfection efﬁcacy was determined by qrtPCR (Figure S1c). The western blot data revealed that Mig-6siRNA
transfection up-regulated both EGFR phosphorylation and
MBP synthesis (Fig. 1c at bottom). These data indicated
that Mig-6 expression was involved in MBP synthesis. The
30 untranslated region (30 -UTR) of Mig-6 is a direct target of
miR-200 in urothelial cancer cells (Adam et al. 2009). We
therefore sought to investigate whether the 30 -UTR of Mig6 is a direct target of miR-200 in rat SVZ-neurospheres and
primary OPCs. The 30 -UTR of Mig-6 pmiR-GLO construct
and the mutated/mismatched miR-200 target site in 30 -UTR
of Mig-6 pmiR-GLO construct (mutant) were generated and
analyzed based on luciferase assay in rat SVZ-neurospheres
and primary OPCs according to manufacturer’s protocol
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), as described in
Appendix S1. The transfection efﬁciencies for over-expression (> 10 fold) and knock-down (> 5 fold) of miR-200
family members were determined by qrtPCR (Figure S2),
and utilized for all the following experiments. The 30 -UTR
of Mig-6 pmiR-GLO construct transfection markedly
reduced luciferase activity which was signiﬁcantly reversed
after anti-miR-200a transfection or anti-miR-200b or antimiR-200c. In contrast, mutated 30 -UTR of Mig-6 pmiRGLO construct transfection had no effect on luciferase
activity (Figure S3). The co-transfection of Lenti-miR-200b200a-429 or Lenti-miR-200c-141 with 30 -UTR of Mig-6
pmiR-GLO construct markedly augmented luciferase

activities. In contrast, co-transfection of Lenti-miR-200b200a-429 or Lenti-miR-200c-141 with mutated 30 -UTR of
Mig-6 pmiR-GLO construct had no effect on luciferase
activities (Figure S3). These data indicate that 30 -UTR of
Mig-6 is a direct target of miR-200a, -200b and -200c in rat
SVZ-neurospheres and primary OPCs. We therefore investigated whether Tb4 treatment affects the expression of the
miR-200 family.
Tb4 treatment induces expression of miR-200a in vitro in
rat SVZ progenitor cells and embryonic primary OPCs, and
in vivo in rats subjected to MCAO
To examine the effect of Tb4 treatment on expression of
miR-200 family members, rat SVZ-neurospheres and
primary OPCs were treated with Tb4 at the dose of 0, 25,
50 and 100 ng/mL for 7 days. The qrtPCR data revealed
that Tb4 treatment markedly up-regulated miR-200a, miR200b and miR-429 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 1d), but rarely affected miR-200c and miR-141 (data
not shown). These data indicate that Tb4 treatment upregulated miR-200b-a-429 cluster gene, but not miR-200c141 cluster gene. These data were also consistent with
in vivo up-regulation of miR-200a level in rats subjected to
MCAO after Tb4 (12 mg/kg) treatment (Fig. 1e), as
described in Supplementary Methods. In contrast, Tb4
(12 mg/kg) treatment had no effect on the expression level
of miR-200b, -200c, -429 and -141 (data not shown). Tb4
(12 mg/kg) treatment, not only up-regulated miR-200a
expression, but also down-regulated in vivo mRNA expression of miR-200 target Mig-6 (Fig. 1e bottom). However,
MCAO had no effect on Mig-6 expression (Fig. 1e bottom).
These data indicate that in vivo up-regulation of miR-200a
level may activate EGFR signaling in vivo. However, the
molecular mechanism how Tb4 induces miR-200 expression is unknown. From genomic DNA of human chromosome-1 or mouse chromosome-4, a single tricistronic
primary microRNA cluster gene encoding miR-200b, miR200a and miR-429 (Figure S4a) and, from genomic DNA of
human chromosome-12 or mouse chromosome-6, another
single bicistronic primary microRNA cluster gene encoding
miR-200c and miR-141(Figure S4b), are transcribed by
RNA polymerase II (Tr€
umbach and P. 2015). The miR200b-a-429 cluster gene resides within an intergenic region
that has an enhancer located approximately 5.1 kb upstream
of the miR-200b-a-429 transcriptional start site (Attema
et al. 2013). This enhancer recruits sequence-speciﬁc transcription factors, and inﬂuences transcription of miR-200ba-429 cluster gene, may be regulated by Tb4 (Figure S4a).
In contrast, this enhancer may be missing in the promoter of
primary miR-200b-a-429 cluster gene (Figure S4b). However, further investigations are necessary to determine
whether Tb4 regulates directly transcription of mir-200ba-429 cluster gene or indirectly regulates miRNA maturation on a post-transcriptional level.

Thymosin beta 4 up-regulates miR-200a

Transfection with miR-200b-a-429 cluster gene enhances
EGFR signaling and MBP synthesis
As Tb4 up-regulated miR-200a, b and 429, we hypothesized
that miR-200 targets and reduces expression of Mig-6, a
potent inhibitor of EGFR phosphorylation, and enhances
EGFR signaling. To test this hypothesis, we transiently
transfected rat SVZ-neurospheres, and primary OPCs, with
one genomic cluster of miR-200 (e.g., miR-200b-200a-429)
expression vector (pLenti4.1EX), in order to over-express, or
with anti-miR-200a to knock-down miR-200a, respectively.
The qrtPCR and western blot data demonstrated that the
miR-200b-a-429 cluster transfection markedly up-regulated
MBP at the mRNA and protein levels, along with decreasing
Mig-6 protein level and increasing EGFR phosphorylation in
rat SVZ-neurospheres, and primary OPCs (Fig. 2a). To
determine speciﬁcity of MBP antibody, whole blots were
examined (Figure S5). These data conﬁrmed that MBP

antibody strongly recognized MBP bands based on
molecular size (~ 15 kDa) in rat SVZ-neurospheres, and
primary OPCs (Figure S5). These data indicated that miR200b-a-429 cluster transfection targeted Mig-6, increased
EGFR phosphorylation and induced MBP synthesis and
oligodendrocyte differentiation.
To determine whether expression of miR-200a was
required for Tb4-mediated MBP synthesis, we transfected
Tb4 (50 ng/mL) treated cells (SVZ-neurospheres and OPCs)
with anti-miR-200a. Western blot analysis showed that antimiR-200a transfection reversed the Tb4 effect on EGFR
phosphorylation and MBP synthesis (Fig. 2b). These data
indicated that Tb4 induced MBP synthesis in a miR-200a
dependent EGFR signaling pathway. However, enhanced
EGFR signaling usually activates or phosphorylates ERK1
leading to activation/phoshorylation of a transcription factor,
c-Jun, a potent inhibitor of MBP promoter (Daub et al. 1996;

Santra et al. 2012, 2014). We therefore investigated whether
miR-200b-a-429 cluster transfection induces phosphorylation
of ERK1 in rat SVZ-neurospheres, and primary OPCs.
Western blot data revealed that miR-200b-a-429 cluster
transfection surprisingly down-regulated phosphorylation of
ERK1 and c-Jun (Fig. 2c). Tb4 (50 ng/mL) treatment also
consistently suppressed phosphorylation of ERK1 and c-Jun
(Fig. 2c), as previously reported (Santra et al. 2012, 2014).
These data suggested that miR-200a may target any of the
adaptors or mediators of EGFR signaling. We therefore
investigated TargetScan database (http://www.mirbase.org)
of miR-200a for the adaptor and mediators, which drive
EGFR/Grb2/ERK signaling pathway.
Transfection with miR-200b-a-429 cluster inhibits
phosphorylation of ERK1 after targeting Grb2, a key adaptor
for EGFR/Grb2/Ras/ERK1 signaling pathway
Based on TargetScan database (http://www.mirbase.org), we
found that 30 -UTR of Grb2 was direct target of miR-200a.
The direct target of miR-200a for Grb2 has been previously
conﬁrmed in HEK293T cells (Liu et al. 2013c). The rat
SVZ-neurospheres and primary OPCs were therefore transfected with the miR-200b-200a-429 cluster, and treated with
Tb4 treatment (50 ng/mL). The qrtPCR and western blot
analysis revealed that transfection and treatment alone, and
combined transfection with treatment markedly down-

(a)

regulated Grb2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels,
and inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1 and c-Jun, but upregulated MBP (Fig. 2d and e). In contrast, Tb4siRNA or
anti-miR-200a transfection reversed the effect of miR-200b200a-429 cluster transfection, and Tb4 treatment (50 ng/mL)
on Grb2 expression, phosphorylation of ERK1 and c-Jun,
and MBP expression (Fig. 2d and e). These data are also
consistent with the previous data of miR-200a transfection
which targets Grb2 in mouse embryonic stem cells (Liu et al.
2013c). These data are also consistent with our previous
results on induction of OPC differentiation into oligodendrocyte after reduction in phosphorylation of ERK1 and cJun (Santra et al. 2012, 2014). Inhibition of ERK1 signaling
enhances the EGFR/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/
AKT signaling pathway (Gan et al. 2010). We therefore
investigated the effect of Tb4 on AKT activation in the
EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
Tb4 treatment activates AKT in miR-200a dependent
pathway
To determine the effect of Tb4 treatment on AKT activation,
the rat SVZ-neurospheres and primary OPCs were treated
with Tb4 at the dose of 0, 25, 50 and 100 ng/mL for 7 days.
Western blot data demonstrated that Tb4 treatment induced
activation/phosphorylation of AKT in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 3a and b). In contrast, anti-miR-200a

transfection reversed the Tb4 effect on AKT activation
(Fig. 3c and d). These data indicated that Tb4 treatment
induced AKT activation in miR-200a dependent pathway,
and suggested that miR-200a may target endogenous PI3K/
AKT inhibitors. Two miR-200a targets, FOG2 and PTEN,
negatively regulate PI3K/AKT pathway (Hyun et al. 2009;
Li et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2014; Becker et al. 2015). We
therefore examined the effect of miR-200a on the expression
of FOG2 and PTEN, and AKT activation in the rat SVZneurospheres and primary OPCs.

To determine the effect of Tb4 treatment on the expression of
FOG2 and PTEN, rat SVZ-neurospheres and primary OPCs
were treated with Tb4 at the dose of 0, 25, 50 and 100 ng/mL
for 7 days. QrtPCR and western blot data demonstrated that
expression of FOG2 and PTEN was down-regulated in a
dose-dependent manner in mRNA and protein levels
(Fig. 4a, b and c). To examine the effect of miR-200a on
the expression of FOG2 and PTEN, and AKT phosphorylation/activation, the rat SVZ-neurospheres and primary OPCs
were transfected with miR-200b-a-429 cluster. Western blot
data demonstrated that miR-200b-a-429 cluster transfection,
Tb4 treatment (50 ng/mL), and miR-200b-a-429 cluster
transfection combined with Tb4 treatment (50 ng/mL)
down-regulated the expression of FOG2 and PTEN, but

enhanced AKT phosphorylation/activation in the rat SVZneurospheres and primary OPCs (Fig. 4d). In contrast, antimiR-200a transfection reversed the effect of Tb4 treatment
on expression of FOG2 and PTEN, and phosphorylation/
activation of AKT in the rat SVZ-neurospheres and primary
OPCs (Fig. 4d). These data demonstrated that Tb4 treatment
increased AKT activation in the rat SVZ neurospheres and
primary OPCs after miR-200a-mediated inhibition of expression of FOG2 and PTEN. Enhanced AKT activation is
involved in cell survival and also enhances mouse double
minute 2 homolog (MDM2) -mediated ubiquitination and
degradation of p53, an inducer of pro-apoptotic genes (Zhou
et al. 2001). The miR-200a directly targets p53 which is upregulated after ischemic stroke in experimental animal
models and triggers cell death, as previously reported (Chopp
et al. 1992; Hong et al. 2010; Becker et al. 2012). Moreover, ischemic lesion is signiﬁcantly reduced in p53 knockout
mice, subjected to MCAO (Crumrine et al. 1994). We
therefore sought to investigate, whether Tb4 treatment or
miR-200b-a-429 cluster transfection affects p53 expression
in the rat SVZ-neurospheres and primary OPCs, and protect
these cells from ischemic insult such as OGD.

Effect of in vivo Tb4 treatment on miR-200 targets, e.g.,
GRB2, FOG2 and Pten, in rats subjected to MCAO
To examine miR-200 targets in vivo, parafﬁn embedded
brain slides from normal rats, rats subjected to MCAO and
rats subjected to MCAO followed by treatment with Tb4
(12 mg/kg), were immunostained with diaminobenzidine
(DAB) for GRB2, FOG2, and Pten antibodies analyzed in
peri-infarct area of rat brain subjected to MCAO. In normal
rat brain, tissue from the area corresponding to the periinfarct area of rat brain subjected to MCAO was selected for
analysis. These data showed signiﬁcant down-regulation of
miR-200a targets, e.g., GRB2, FOG2 and Pten (Fig. 6).
These in vivo data were consistent with in vitro downregulation of GRB2, FOG2, and Pten. Thus, Tb4 treatment

in vivo and in vitro may induce AKT activation and protect
brain cells from MCAO-mediated apoptosis. Our data and
observations of miR-200-mediated neuroprotection (Lee
et al. 2010), Tb4-mediated improvement of functional
neurologic outcome in a rat model of embolic stroke (Morris
et al. 2010a), and neuroprotection in a rat model of TBI
(Xiong et al. 2012b) indicate therapeutic importance of Tb4
and miR-200 for the treatment of stroke and TBI.

transfection of miR-200c-141 cluster showed the same
effects as miR-200b-a-429 cluster on inhibition of OGDinduced apoptosis (Figure S6 and S7); down-regulation of
GRB2, Mig-6, FOG2, Pten, and P53; and up-regulation of
MBP and phospho-AKT (Figure S8a and b). These data
suggest the therapeutic beneﬁt of the entire miR-200 family
for treatment of neurologic diseases, e.g., stroke and TBI. We
therefore investigated whether Tb4 treatment down-regulates
miR-200 targets in vivo in rats subjected to MCAO.

study, we demonstrated that Tb4 induced MBP expression in
a novel miR-200a regulated molecular mechanism of inhibition of EGFR/Grb2/ERK1/c-Jun signaling. When the
EGFR/Grb2/ERK1 signaling is blocked, EGFR/PI3K/AKT
signaling is usually activated (Gan et al. 2010). Our data
demonstrated that Tb4 treatment markedly up-regulated
AKT activation/phosphorylation leading to cell survival in
a novel miR-200a dependent pathway. Tb4 treatment
(in vitro and in vivo) or miR-200b-a-429 cluster transfection
(in vitro) down-regulated the known targets of miR-200a,
e.g., the potent EGFR kinase inhibitor- ERRFI-1/Mig-6 and
inhibitors of PI3K/AKT signaling- FOG2 and PTEN, leading
to markedly activation of AKT. ERRFI-1/Mig-6 is a
cytosolic endogenous protein which binds and inhibits
phosphorylation/activation of EGFR (Xu et al. 2005, 2006;
Zhang et al. 2007; Descot et al. 2009). After miR-200mediated down-regulation of Mig-6, EGFR was constitutively activated leading to PI3K/AKT activation. AKT was
further activated, when PI3K inhibitors, FOG2 and PTEN
were down-regulated after Tb4 treatment or miR-200b-a-429
cluster transfection. As anti-miR-200a transfection reversed
the Tb4 effect on AKT activation, Tb4 treatment markedly
activated AKT via a novel miR-200 dependent EGFR/PI3K/
AKT pathway. Tb4 treatment or miR-200b-a-429 cluster
transfection down-regulated in vitro another known target of
miR-200a, p53, an inducer of pro-apoptotic genes, and
inhibited ischemic-induced cell death in a cell culture model
of OGD. Since anti-miR-200a transfection reversed the Tb4
effect on p53 expression and OGD-mediated apoptosis, Tb4
treatment markedly activated AKT as well as reduced p53
expression leading to inhibition of apoptosis via miR-200a
dependent EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These data
were also consistent with neuroprotective effect of miR-200
transfection in NPC line, Neuro-2a, subjected to OGD for
16 h (Lee et al. 2010).
EGFR controls cell growth, differentiation, migration, and
oligodendrogenesis in mammalian brain (Aguirre and G.
2007; Aguirre et al. 2007). When EGFR’s intrinsic kinase is
activated, it drives several downstream intracellular signaling
pathways, e.g., Grb2/Ras/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT (Hayakawa-Yano et al. 2007; Gan et al. 2010). Our data demonstrated that Tb4-mediated up-regulation of miR-200 family
members down-regulated Grb2, blocked EGFR/Grb2/Ras/
MEK/ERK/cJun signaling, but activated EGFR/PI3K/AKT
signaling. The reduced EGFR signaling attenuates MBP
expression and oligodendrogenesis in the wa2 mouse
(Aguirre and G. 2007; Aguirre et al. 2007). EGFR/PI3K/
AKT signaling may be required for MBP expression. EGFR/
Grb2/Ras/MEK/ERK signaling induces proliferation. In
contrast, EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway mediates cell
survival/differentiation (Furnari et al. 2007). EGFR/PI3K/
AKT signaling is required, but EGFR/Grb2/Ras/MEK/ERK
is not required for oligodendrogenesis in the number of
Olig2+ progenitor cells in the developing spinal cord

(Hayakawa-Yano et al. 2007). When cell differentiation
switches on, the proliferation of cells therefore turns off. In
this study, our data also demonstrated that Tb4-induced miR200 activated EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling which was
required for MBP synthesis.
AKT is a serine/threonine kinase which phosphorylates
more than 30 downstream targets/substrates and regulates
cell survival, growth, differentiation, migration, and metabolism in a cell-speciﬁc manner (Somanath et al. 2006). In
OPCs, activation of AKT induces cell survival, MBP
synthesis and differentiation into myelinating mature oligodendrocytes in vivo in transgenic (Plp-Akt-DD) mice (Flores
et al. 2000, 2008; Frederick et al. 2007; Pang et al. 2007;
Yang et al. 2007; Narayanan et al. 2009). In this study, we
demonstrated that Tb4-induced miR-200 down-regulated
FOG2 and PTEN, which were the endogenous potent
inhibitors of PI3K. As a result, AKT was activated. FOG2
inhibits active PI3K complex formation between p85 and
p110 by forming inactivation PI3K complex between p85
and FOG2 (Hyun et al. 2009). Thus, Tb4- and miR-200induced down-regulation of FOG2, enhanced active PI3K
complex (p110 and p85a) formation, PI3K activation and
AKT activation (Hyun et al. 2009). PI3K phosphorylates
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate which phosphorylates/activates AKT
(Sansal and S. 2004; Mellinghoff et al. 2005), whereas
PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate to phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate by its lipid phosphatase activity and inhibits PI3K/
AKT activation (Sansal and S. 2004; Mellinghoff et al.
2005). Tb4- and miR-200-induced down-regulation of
PTEN, therefore, induced AKT activation. The rationale
for choosing FOG2 and PTEN is to determine cell survival
signaling pathway via PI3K/AKT activation. FOG2 and
PTEN both negatively regulate PI3K/AKT activation. Downregulation of both of these potent endogenous inhibitors of
PI3K/AKT results in strong AKT activation leading to cell
survival and protection of cells from OGD-mediated apoptosis.
The activation of AKT has been shown to phosphorylate
MDM2, and increase the nuclear localization of MDM2.
Phosphorylated MDM2 interacts with p300 and p53, which
undergoes ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (Zhou et al.
2001). The p53 is a transcription factor which induces the
pro-apoptotic genes, e.g., Noxa and PUMA, in many cells,
especially neurons (Cregan et al. 2004). PUMA is localized
in mitochondria where it interacts with Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and
Bax. As a result, cytochrome c is released, thereby caspases9 and -3 are activated, and the cells including neurons and
OPCs, undergo apoptosis (Cregan et al. 2004; Pang et al.
2007). Our present data demonstrated that Tb4 treatment
down-regulated p53 via miR-200a-mediated direct effect and
via AKT activation, and inhibited OGD-mediated apoptosis.

Fig. 7 A summarizing schematic diagram of mechanistic cascades for
thymosin beta 4 (Tb4)-induced oligoprogenitor cells (OPC) differentiation and inhibition of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-mediated
apoptosis in novel miR-200-regulated EGFR signaling pathways.
Exogenous Tb4 administration up-regulated miR-200a which targeted
growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), blocked proliferating
signal (EGFR/Grb2/ERK1), and thereby induced OPC differentiation by
increasing myelin basic protein (MBP) (a marker of OPC differentiation)
synthesis. Tb4-induced up-regulation of miR-200a targeted endogenous inhibitors of EGFR signaling, e.g., Mig-6 for EGFR and, friend of
GATA 2 (FOG2) and phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted in
chromosome 10 (Pten) for PI3K. As a result, AKT was markedly
activated. AKT activation usually induces 1) cell survival, 2) OPC
differentiation via AKT/mTOR/MBP, and 3) inhibition of apoptosis via
MDM2-mediated p53 degradation. Tb4-induced miR-200a directly
targeted P53, reduced p53 synthesis and inhibited P53-mediated
apoptosis. Protection of progenitor cells from OGD-mediated apoptosis
may contribute the therapeutic beneﬁts of Tb4 and miR-200 for stroke
and other neuronal diseases associated with demyelination disorders.

neuronal death in an animal model of embolic stroke, as
previously reported (Chopp et al. 1992). Other neuronal
death paradigms, e.g., hypoxia and excitotoxicity, have been
shown to up-regulate the expression of p53 (Banasiak and H.
1998; Halterman and F. 1999). Post-mitotic neurons undergo
apoptosis after over-expression of p53 (Slack et al. 1996;
Cregan et al. 1999). In contrast, excitotoxicity and stroke
result in reduced brain damage in p53 null mice in compared
to wild-type mice (Crumrine et al. 1994; Morrison et al.
1996). Thus, Tb4- or miR-200b-a-429 cluster–mediated
AKT activation and p53 down-regulation may be involved
in inhibition of OGD-induced apoptosis and may provide a
new therapeutic approach and implication for the treatment
of neurologic injury. In addition, the reduction in OGDinduced apoptosis by Tb4- or miR-200b-a-429 cluster
suggest that Tb4 treatment or miR-200b-a-429 cluster
transfection may also enhance the survival of stroke-induced
newborn cells (OPCs and NPCs) in the SVZ, and thereby
promote neurologic recovery (Jin et al. 2001, 2006; Zhang
et al. 2001, 2004a,b, 2013b; Arvidsson et al. 2002; Parent
et al. 2002; Macas et al. 2006; Minger et al. 2007; Zhang

129

and Chopp 2009; Curtis et al. 2011). These newborn NPCs
migrate from the SVZ to the infarct area of ischemic stroke.
These migrated NPCs differentiate into parenchymal cells
including neurons. However, in the striatum, only 20% of the
newly generated cells survive, resulting in an estimated
replacement of only 0.2% of the cells that are lost as a result
of ischemia in a rat model of embolic stroke (Arvidsson et al.
2002). Our data are consistent with observations that Tb4
and miR-200 (Lee et al. 2010) provide signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁts for the treatment of stroke and TBI (Morris et al.
2010a; Xiong et al. 2012a).
In summary, Tb4 treatment up-regulated miR-200 expression which targeted Grb2 and blocked EGFR/Grb2/Ras/
MEK/ERK/c-Jun signaling pathway to proliferation
(Fig. 7). Blockage of proliferation signaling induced MBP
synthesis and OPC differentiation, as c-Jun activation
negatively regulate MBP synthesis. Tb4-induced miR-200
down-regulated EGFR inhibitor- ERRFI-1/Mig6, and PI3K
inhibitors (FOG2 and PTEN), as a result, AKT was
activated (Fig. 7). The enhanced AKT activation also
induces MBP via EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and OPC differentiation, as previously reported (Flores et al. 2008; Narayanan et al. 2009). The enhanced AKT activation
phosphorylates MDM2 which induces p53-ubiquitination
and degradation (Fig. 7). The Tb4-induced miR-200a also
directly down-regulated p53 expression (Fig. 7). Since p53
induces apoptosis in ischemic cells, rat SVZ progenitor cells
and embryonic primary OPCs may be protected from OGDmediated apoptosis (Fig. 7). These data suggest that Tb4
via miR-200 may contribute the therapeutic beneﬁts for
stroke and other neuronal diseases associated with demyelination disorders (Baumann and P.-D. 2001; Scaﬁdi et al.
2014).
