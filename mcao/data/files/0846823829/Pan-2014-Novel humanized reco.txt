Abstract Transmigration of peripheral leukocytes to the
brain is a major contributor to cerebral ischemic cell death
mechanisms. Humanized partial major histocompatibility
complex class II constructs (pMHC), covalently linked to
myelin peptides, are effective for treating experimental stroke
in males, but new evidence suggests that some inflammatory
cell death mechanisms after brain injury are sex-specific. We
here demonstrate that treatment with pMHC constructs also
improves outcomes in female mice with middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO). HLA-DR2 transgenic female mice with
MCAO were treated with RTL1000 (HLA-DR2 moiety linked
to human MOG-35-55 peptide), HLA-DRa1-MOG-35-55, or
vehicle (VEH) at 3, 24, 48, and 72 h after reperfusion and
were recovered for 96 h or 2 weeks post-injury for measurement of histology (TTC staining) or behavioral testing.
RTL1000- and DRa1-MOG-treated mice had profoundly

reduced infarct volumes as compared to the VEH group,
although higher doses of DRa1-MOG were needed for females vs. males evaluated previously. RTL1000-treated females also exhibited strongly improved functional recovery
in a standard cylinder test. In novel studies of post-ischemic
ultrasonic vocalization (USV), as measured by animal calls to
their cage mates, we modeled in mice the post-stroke speech
deficits common in human stroke survivors. The number of
calls was reduced in injured animals relative to pre-MCAO
baseline regardless of RTL1000 treatment status. However,
call duration was significantly improved by RTL1000 treatment, suggesting benefit to the animal’s recovery of vocalization capability. We conclude that both the parent RTL1000
molecule and the novel non-polymorphic DRα1-MOG-35-55
construct were highly effective immunotherapies for treatment
of transient cerebral ischemia in females.

Introduction
Inflammation is not only an important mechanism that contributes to brain damage after cerebral ischemia but also an
important element in protection and repair. It is now well
established that significant brain injury, including ischemic
stroke in humans and animals [1–3], triggers rapid activation
of the peripheral immune system, resulting in migration of
immunocytes such as T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and
neutrophils into the damaged area [4–6]. Furthermore, postischemic CNS activation of the peripheral immune system is
followed by immunosuppression that is marked by drastic
atrophy of lymphoid tissue such as spleen and thymus in
animals [3, 7] and is under investigation in humans [8]. Thus,
immunotherapy that targets the inflammatory milieu of the
brain and which averts derangement of immune function
would be highly promising with potential applications to the
clinic.
Partial major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHC)
constructs, including recombinant T cell receptor ligands
(RTL) molecules, have been designed with α1 and β1 domains of the MHC class II molecules expressed as a single
polypeptide with (or without) antigenic peptide extensions [9,
10]. These constructs have been well studied in experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), in phase 1 clinical
trials for multiple sclerosis (MS) [11, 12], and currently are
in phase 2 efficacy trials for MS. We reported previously that
RTL551 (pI-Ab/mMOG-35-55) administered 4 h after middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) improved experimental
injury outcomes [13, 14]. More importantly for human stroke,
RTL1000 (an HLA-DR2 moiety linked to human MOG-3555 peptide) reduced infarct size and improved behavioral
outcomes in humanized DR2 mice [15]. We have recently
shown that RTL1000 binds to and downregulates CD74, the
natural receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor,
MIF, on CD11b + cells, thus strongly inhibiting MIFdependent inflammation [16, 17].
One impediment to the use of these recombinant proteins in
humans is the requirement to match the recipient patient’s
MHC class II with the polymorphic β1 domain of the RTL
construct in order to reduce possible alloreactivity. To circumvent this restriction, a novel RTL was developed that contains
the non-polymorphic HLA-DRα1 but not the HLA-DR2β1
domain, thus preventing any possible alloreactivity to β1,
linked to the MOG-35-55 peptide [18]. This construct reduced
infarction after transient MCAO in male mice [19].
All of these studies have been carried out exclusively in
male animals. It is now well known that some molecular

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:577–585

mechanisms of cell death after brain injury are sex-specific
and that not all therapies work equally in male vs. female
animals [for reviews see 20–22]. Recently, we observed that
there are significant differences in the female vs. male immune
response to ischemic brain injury. Specifically, male rodents
inhibit larger infarction after MCAO [23, 24] and, perhaps
consequently, are more vulnerable than females to postischemic spleen destruction and early, large transmigration
of monocytes (macrophages and dendritic cells) from spleen
to brain. Some of these processes differ in the female (6).
Accordingly, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate
therapeutically relevant pMHC in female mice and determine
efficacy in reducing histological damage and behavioral deficits. Such studies are required if these agents are to be
employed in the clinic in patients of both sexes.

Methods
Female DR2 mice were randomized to receive 100 μg
RTL1000 or TRIS-buffer vehicle (VEH 0.1 ml) by subcutaneous injection at 3, 24, 48, and 72 h of reperfusion postMCAO. Animals for the HLA-DRα1-MOG-35-55 study
were randomized to receive 100 μg, 500 μg, 1 mg, or vehicle
at 3, 24, 48, and 72 h of reperfusion. Drug doses and treatment
intervals were based on previous studies in males.
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced via 60 min
of reversible right MCAO using the intraluminal filament
technique (6–0 suture) under isoflurane anesthesia as previously described [15]. Temporalis muscle temperature was
maintained at 35.5–37.5 °C throughout MCAO with a heating
lamp, and occlusion/reperfusion was confirmed by laserdoppler flowmetry (LDF). Sham-operated mice were handled
in the same way as MCAO-treated animals with the exception
of cauterizing the common, external, and internal arteries.
During the recovery period, all mice were evaluated for general health status on days 1 to 3 after surgery, as previously
described [15].

Histology
Animals were survived for 96 h post-MCAO and then
euthanized under deep isoflurane anesthesia for 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) histology, as previously
described [15]. Both sides of each slice were photographed
with a digital camera. Infarction volume was determined
by digital photography and image analysis (Image J, NIH,
USA) and integrated across four slices. The mice were
excluded if intracranial or subarachnoid hemorrhage was
found. Infarct volume was expressed as a percentage of the
contralateral structure.

Behavioral Studies

Recording Mouse Ultrasonic Vocalization (USV)

Mice undergoing behavioral testing were single housed in a
12/12-h light–dark cycle, and all assessments were carried out
by an observer blinded to treatment during the second half of
the light cycle (1200 to 1800 h). The corner turn test was used
to determine unilateral sensorimotor dysfunction, as previously described with some modifications [25]. Briefly, the animal
is encouraged into a narrow-angled corner, forcing the animal
to turn to its uninjured side. Each animal was tested by ten
trials timed for pre-MCAO, day 8 post-MCAO, and day 15
post-MCAO. To supplement the corner turn test but allow for
greater sensitivity for early post-MCAO sensory motor deficits, we developed a novel tube test that determines an animal’s preference for sidedness when facing a dead end. The
animal was placed in a horizontal tube with one end closed off
by a Plexiglas square. The tube itself is 20 cm long with a
diameter of 5 cm; narrow enough to encourage the animal to
reach the tube end but large enough for turning. An uninjured
animal will turn to left or right with equal likelihood, while an
animal post-MCAO will turn to the contralateral side as it
experiences decreased sensory and motor control in the injured side. Animals were tested pre-MCAO and at days 1, 2, 3,
and 8 post-MCAO. The pre-test consisted of ten trials; after
each complete turn, the animal was removed from the tube for
30 s of rest before the next trial. Testing at days 1, 2, and 3
post-MCAO consisted of only five trials due to decreased
mobility, while testing at day 8 returned to a full ten trials.
The cylinder test was used as previously described [26] to
analyze forelimb use bias pre-MCAO and at days 3, 7, and 14
post-MCAO. Briefly, the animal was placed in a transparent
cylinder that allows rearing behavior. Using video-recording,
paw touches to the cylinder are counted as the animal rears
and supports its weight. A count of “both” was added when
the animal used both paws simultaneously or needed to add
the second paw to help support itself. Each test was concluded
when 20 touches were counted or at 10 min. Final scores were
calculated as right turns as a percentage of the animal’s preMCAO score.
To test sensory-cognitive function, the social novel odor
recognition task was used as previously described [27]. Briefly, wooden balls were placed in the animal’s cage to absorb the
“home” odor. In contrast, novel odor balls were curated from
an alternative cage housing mice not known to the animal. On
day 1 of testing, each animal was individually placed in the
home cage with four home odor balls for three 1-min trials.
One novel odor ball was then introduced to the animal on days
5 and 6 post-MCAO. Trials were again conducted with
the novel odor, allowing the animal to habituate to this
odor. Twenty-four hours later, the animal was again exposed to a home odor ball and the previously novel odor
ball. Time spent exploring each of the balls was recorded
and analyzed.

Animals were tested in a dark recording chamber which
consists of a 29×18×25 cm3 acrylic cage divided into upper
and lower subchambers with a microphone poised in the lower
subchamber. USVs were monitored and recorded using software (Avisoft-SAS Lab Pro, Berlin Germany). Mice were
housed in groups of four, as in other behavior tests. For
testing, a mouse is separated 1 day prior to recording and then
placed in the lower subchamber while stimulated by its smell
and calls of its previous cage mates in the upper subchamber
over 50 mins of recording time. Mice were tested 1 day preMCAO as a baseline, followed by repeat testing at 3 days
post-MCAO. Only mice with robust vocalization (greater than
50 “calls” in the 50-min recording session) were included in
the testing. The total number of calls, call duration, and
frequency bandwidth (frequency range 30–120 kHz) were
analyzed for each session, then compared between shamtreated, vehicle-treated, or RTL1000-treated MCAO mice.
Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean±SEM. Histological and
physiological data were analyzed with two-tailed Student’s T test for the two treatment groups (e.g., infarction)
and analysis of variance (ANOVA) corrected for multiple
comparisons by post hoc Tukey’s test for all groups (e.g.,
LDF, temporalis muscle temperature). Behavior testing
was analyzed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA
with a post hoc Student Newman Keuls test to correct
for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyses were
carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 21.0;
IBM, New York, NY, USA). The criterion for statistical
significance was p≤0.05.

Results
1. RTL1000 strongly reduces infarction (Fig. 1): RTL1000
reduced infarct volumes (expressed as percent of contralateral structure): in total hemisphere 14.3±4.1 % in RTL
(n=15) vs. 26.8±2.9 % in VEH (n=15) (P=0.009). Reduced infarction was apparent in cortex (19.9±6.3 % in
RTL vs. 44.2±5.0 % in VEH (P=0.005)) and striatum
(24.2±6.8 % in RTL vs. 52.4±4.7 % in VEH group (P=
0.002)). Mice with no measurable infarction evident at
96 h numbered 6/15 in the RTL group, but only 1/15 in
the vehicle-treated group. There were no differences in
intraischemic LDF (15±1.0 % in RTL vs. in 13±1.3 %
VEH (P>0.05)) or temporalis muscle temperature (37.0±
0.2 in RTL vs. 36.7±0.2 in VEH (P>0.05)). No difference was found in weight and health scores between
groups. Mortality was 1 in RTL and 1 in VEH. Two mice

process, and six were excluded due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (four in RTL group and two in VEH group).
2. HLA-DRα1-MOG-35-55 reduces infarction in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2): 1 mg treatment with HLADRα1-MOG-35-55 reduced infarct volume relative to
vehicle treatment, in total hemisphere (22.8±4.4 % in
HLA-DRα1-MOG-35-55 (n=10) vs. 33.1 ±1.3 % in
VEH (n=14) (P=0.02)); in cortex (34.9±7.3 % vs. 56.5
±2.9 % (P=0.007)); and in striatum (48.2±8.0 % vs. 69.7
±3.7 % (p=0.02)). In contrast, 100 μg (n=12) and 500 μg
(n=11) doses improved infarction relative to the VEH
group. No difference was observed in intraischemic
LDF among the various groups (12±0.7 % in 100 μg
vs. 11±0.6 % in 500 μg vs. 9±0.4 % in 1 mg vs. 11±

vs. 36.2±0.1C° in 1 mg vs. 36.2±0.1C° in VEH (P=
0.05)). No differences in body weight, health scores, or
mortality rates were observed among the groups. The only
deaths occurred in the vehicle-treated and 500 μg treated
group (two in each group).

3. Neurobehavioral testing was conducted on the following
16 day survival cohorts: MCAO RTL1000=16, MCAO
vehicle=17, sham RTL1000=10, and sham vehicle=10.
In both the corner turn and tube turn tests, injured animals
show a preference for turning towards the injured side as
the animal uses its uninjured limbs to turn its body
(Table 1). MCAO animals in both treatment groups
showed this preference at 8 days post-stroke (MCAO
vehicle 75.9±6, sham vehicle 43±6.3, MCAO RTL1000
77.5±6, sham RTL1000 56±4; P=0.05), but the effect
was ameliorated at day 15 post-stroke. In the tube turn test
(Fig. 3), both the MCAO treatment groups showed a
preference to turn to the injured side as compared to their
treatment-matched shams.
4. The cylinder test was conducted prior to surgery and then
on days 3, 7, and 14 post-operatively. There were no
differences in the pre-test scores (not shown) or between
sham groups at any time point (Fig. 4). The vehicletreated MCAO group showed preference for the right
(uninjured) forelimb at every post-operative time point,
as expected (P values = 0.05). The RTL1000-treated
MCAO group showed no difference in forelimb preference as compared to sham at any time point but was
significantly different from the vehicle-treated MCAO
group at days 3, 7, and 14 (P=0.05). The improvement
in RTL-treated MCAO group as compared to the VEH
group grew larger over the course of testing.
5. Considering the specificity of RTL1000’s effects and the
unilateral nature of the injury, a drug effect was not
expected in the novel odor recognition test (Table 2).
While all four groups were more interested in the novel
odor than the familiar odor during the first trial, both the
MCAO groups had less exploration of the novel odor than
their matched sham groups (MCAO vehicle 4.8±1.4,
sham vehicle 9.7±1.5, MCAO RTL1000 3.5±0.9, sham
RTL1000 7.3±2.5 (P=0.05)). By the third trial, all groups
of animals had habituated to the novel odor, showing no
time difference spent on the novel vs. familiar odors.
Twenty-four hours after the first exposure to the novel
object, there were no differences in time spent exploring
novel or home odors between any groups (Fig. 5).
6. USV was recorded in each animal at baseline and at day 3
post-MCAO or sham-MCAO and then analyzed for the
number of “calls,” individual call duration, and bandwidth
of calls observed over the recording session. Baseline call
number varied from 50 to 1,640 (MCAO RTL1000 314±
110, MCAO vehicle 341±189, sham 101±18). By day 3,
call number was greatly reduced in post-MCAO animals,
regardless of RTL treatment status (Fig. 6). Similarly, day
3 call duration was reduced in injured animals, although
this effect was improved by RTL1000 treatment (P=
0.05). At day 3, the bandwidth of recorded calls ranged
widely, and there was no difference between groups.

Percentage of Right Turns

The results presented above demonstrate several important
findings. First, both the RTL1000 and DRα1-MOG-35-55
constructs reduced infarct volume in female mice with a
therapeutic window of 3 h post-MCAO. This is consistent
with our previous reports of efficacy in male mice [15, 19].
Second, we show for the first time in either sex that RTL1000
strongly improves behavioral outcome, as assessed by the
cylinder test. The improvement in behavior is specific to
motor function, as would be expected by the unilateral
striatal/cortical injury that typically is produced by unilateral
MCAO.
Third, we studied post-ischemic USV, as measured by
animal calls to their cage mates, as a novel method to model
in animals the post-stroke speech deficits so common in
humans. The number of calls was reduced in injured animals
relative to pre-MCAO baseline, regardless of RTL treatment

MCAO (pre), 24 h after MCAO (post-stroke day 1), 48 h after MCAO
(post-stroke day 2), 72 h after MCAO (post-stroke day 3), and 8 days after
MCAO (post-stroke day 8). MCAO-treated mice (n=33) show a significantly increased preference for right turns at day 2 (*P=0.001) compared

status. However, call duration was improved by RTL treatment, suggesting a beneficial effect of RTL on the animal’s
recovery of robust vocalization capability. We conclude that
both the parent RTL1000 molecule and the novel DRα1MOG-35-55 constructs were highly effective immunotherapies for treatment of transient cerebral ischemia in females.
These results are of particular importance given recently
identified differences in female vs. male immune responses to
ischemic brain injury that include less-prominent inflammatory responses and smaller infarct volumes in females. However, the data clearly demonstrate that such immunological
differences in infarct development did not alter the efficacy of
RTL1000 that involves inhibition of transmigration of monocytes and macrophages from spleen to brain during MCAO.
Thus, this study strongly supports the clinical application of
RTL1000 and possibly DRa1-MOG-35-55 to stroke patients
of both sexes.
Although treatment of MCAO using four daily injections
of 100 μg RTL1000 produced highly significant reductions in
infarct volumes in both females (current study) and males
[15], successful treatment of MCAO with the DRα1 construct

than in males (100 μg). The reasons for this difference remain
unclear but could be related to gender differences in inflammation that are mediated through MIF/CD74 interactions or
MIF-independent mechanisms. We have recently shown that
both RTL1000 and DRα1-MOG-35-55 bind to and downregulate CD74, the natural receptor for macrophage migration
inhibitory factor, MIF, on CD11b+monocytes, macrophages,
and activated microglial cells. This binding removes available
CD74 from the cell surface, directly inhibits MIF binding to
CD74, and blocks downstream MIF effects in the CNS during
EAE [17, 18]. However, it is not yet clear to what extent, if

any, the treatment effect of RTL1000 and DRα1-MOG-35-55
on MCAO in females and males is mediated through MIF
blockade.
Indeed, the total picture of MIF involvement in MCAO,
although still incomplete, appears to include both deleterious
effects during the first week after MCAO not directly linked to
inflammatory mechanisms (reduced infarct size in male MIFKO mice 7 days but not 3 days after MCAO, direct
intraneuronal MIF activity after oxygen glucose deprivation
leading to neuronal cell death, [28, 29] and protective effects
(worse stroke outcome in female MIF-KO mice, [30])). These
findings suggest that MIF may only be involved in the acute
early phase of stroke in males, with effects mainly on neurons,
whereas MIF would not appear to play any pathogenic role in
females with MCAO (Fig. 7). In this light, it is apparent that
the strong treatment effect of RTL1000 and DRα1-MOG-3555 in MCAO is largely MIF independent, especially in female
mice.
In males, there may be some possible MIF-dependent
effects that might include protection from neuronal damage
as we have observed in the EAE, optic neuritis, and macular
degeneration models [31–33]. Although it is unclear what are
the MIF-independent pathways in MCAO affected by
RTL1000 and DRα1 constructs, conceivably they could involve inhibition of MOG-specific inflammatory T cells
through the tethered MOG-35-55 peptide or increased random

habituated to the odor. Twenty-four hours later, all groups showed this
habituated response to the same novel odor. HO=home odor, the animal’s

migration of macrophages induced by reduction of CD74
expression similar to that observed in macrophages from
CD74 KO mice [34].
We utilized sensory, motor, and memory testing, as well as
a novel assessment of vocalization in the female mice. The
cylinder test has been well used as a means of evaluating
motor function in injured rodents, and the data clearly show
a large beneficial effect of RTL1000 on functional recovery.
RTL1000-treated mice fully recovered relative to their sham
counterparts, unlike vehicle-treated animals. As expected,
tests which centered on early recovery (tube and corner

turning) demonstrated a pervasive effect of MCAO in all
animals, emphasizing that the mechanism(s) behind
RTL1000’s efficacy are not due to overall animal health or
morbidity.
Similarly, the RTL1000-treated mice did not perform better
in a test of sensory memory, as measured by the novel odor
recognition test, emphasizing that RTL1000 only improved
functional outcomes in areas specific to MCAO-inflicted
damage.
Our studies are the first to characterize the effect of cerebral
ischemia on the USV that ordinarily occurs in a sex-specific

RTL1000, which is comprised of the HLA-DR2 β1α1 domains linked
to human MOG-35-55 peptide and DRα1-MOG-35-55 that lacks the
polymorphic β1 domain, can reduce infarct size in female and male mice
after MCAO. In males, where peripheral immune cells cause greater
MCAO damage than in females and possibly some MIF dependent
inflammation, RTL1000 and DRα1-MOG-35-55 have the same

treatment potency. In females, which appear to have little if any MIFdependent MCAO damage, treatment with RTL1000 is tenfold more
potent than DRα1-MOG-35-55. This differential treatment effect between males and females could be based on gender-associated effects of
MIF on infarct size, recruitment of peripheral immune cells into the
ischemic brain, and axonal death

and stimulus-specific manner in healthy rats and mice [35,
36]. In the female mouse, baseline vocalization to cage mates
is readily measurable, although there is large variance in this
behavior among animals. Accordingly, we normalized each
animal’s data obtained at post-MCAO day 3 to baseline.
MCAO clearly suppressed both the number and duration of
calls in all animals, and RTL1000 mitigated this abnormality
in part. In contrast, vocalization was not reduced in shamoperated animals, and in some shams, calling to cage mates
relative to baseline. These abnormalities may be specific to
experimental stroke, as we have previously observed in male
rats treated with unilateral haloperidol-induced dopamine depletion or unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine injection that dopaminergic dysfunction narrowed call bandwidth without reducing the number of calls [37]. Male rats treated with caffeine or
amphetamine demonstrate altered 50-kHz vocalization or
“trill calls” [38, 39]. Normal USV in mice has been connected
to the expression of the FOXP2 gene, encoding a transcription
factor containing a polyglutamine tract and fork head DNAbinding domain [36, 40]. Further study is required to evaluate
the mechanism of abnormal post-ischemic USV or if altered
FoxP2 expression plays a role in these abnormalities.
In summary, both the parent RTL1000 molecule and the
novel DRα1-MOG-35-55 constructs were highly effective
immunotherapies for treatment of MCAO in females, in spite
of the requirement for a tenfold higher dose of the DRα1MOG-35-55 construct to achieve comparable effects. Moreover, the non-polymorphic DRα1-MOG-35-55 construct
lacking the polymorphic DR2 β1 domain would be better
suited for treatment of stroke patients without the need for
HLA screening prior to use, an impediment that would limit
use of RTL1000 to pre-screened DR2+ patients.
