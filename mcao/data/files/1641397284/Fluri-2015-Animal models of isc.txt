Stroke is the fifth cause of death in the USA1 and the leading medical cause of acquired
adult disability worldwide.2 Approximately 80% of strokes are ischemic in nature and
result from thromboembolic occlusion of a major cerebral artery or its branches. Vascular occlusion results in deprivation of oxygen and energy, followed by the formation
of reactive oxygen species, release of glutamate, accumulation of intracellular calcium,
and induction of inflammatory processes.3 This sequence of events, termed the ischemic
cascade, leads to irreversible tissue injury (infarction). The ischemic penumbra – that
is, the area of ischemic brain tissue surrounding the infarcted core – is potentially
salvageable if an appropriate treatment is administered within a specified therapeutic
window.4 Two major approaches have been developed to treat ischemic stroke: neuroprotection and reperfusion. The latter therapeutic strategy uses thrombolytic drugs or
mechanical devices to recanalize occluded vessels. The only approved medical treatment for acute ischemic stroke is intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue
plasminogen activator (rtPA).5 However, the therapeutic window of rtPA treatment is
up to 4.5 hours after stroke, and consequently, rtPA is applicable as treatment in only

Abstract: This review outlines the most frequently used rodent stroke models and discusses
their strengths and shortcomings. Mimicking all aspects of human stroke in one animal model
is not feasible because ischemic stroke in humans is a heterogeneous disorder with a complex
pathophysiology. The transient or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model is
one of the models that most closely simulate human ischemic stroke. Furthermore, this model is
characterized by reliable and well-reproducible infarcts. Therefore, the MCAo model has been
involved in the majority of studies that address pathophysiological processes or neuroprotective
agents. Another model uses thromboembolic clots and thus is more convenient for investigating
thrombolytic agents and pathophysiological processes after thrombolysis. However, for many
reasons, preclinical stroke research has a low translational success rate. One factor might be
the choice of stroke model. Whereas the therapeutic responsiveness of permanent focal stroke
in humans declines significantly within 3 hours after stroke onset, the therapeutic window in
animal models with prompt reperfusion is up to 12 hours, resulting in a much longer action time
of the investigated agent. Another major problem of animal stroke models is that studies are
mostly conducted in young animals without any comorbidity. These models differ from human
stroke, which particularly affects elderly people who have various cerebrovascular risk factors.
Choosing the most appropriate stroke model and optimizing the study design of preclinical trials
might increase the translational potential of animal stroke models.

up to 5% of all patients.6 Thus, there is an urgent need for
other, more widely applicable, treatment options.
Over the last four decades, a variety of animal stroke
models have been developed, with the aim of identifying the
mechanisms that underlie cerebral ischemia and developing
new agents for stroke therapy. Animal stroke models are an
indispensable tool for several reasons: (1) Human ischemic
stroke is extremely diverse in its manifestations, causes, and
anatomic localization, whereas an experimental ischemic
stroke is highly reproducible, well controllable, and standardized, allowing more precise analysis of stroke pathophysiology and drug effects. (2) Molecular, genetic, biochemical,
and physiological investigations often require invasive direct
access to brain tissue. (3) Pathophysiological events occurring
during the first minute of an ischemic stroke are most often
not detectable by imaging techniques used in human stroke
and thus can be studied only in an animal model. (4) Perfusion and vasculature (eg, collaterals) are essential in the
pathophysiology of stroke and cannot be modeled in in vitro
models. However, with the exception of rtPA, which was first
investigated in a rabbit stroke model,7 no preclinical-tested neuroprotective agent, either as a single therapy8 or as combination
therapy,9 has been translated into effective stroke therapies.
The poor translational power of preclinical stroke models
has led to the establishment of the Stroke Therapy Academic
Industry Roundtable (STAIR), which issues recommendations to improve the quality of preclinical stroke research.10
However, even strict adherence to these recommendations
has not resulted in major progress in clinical translation. The

success of preclinical stroke research in developing new therapeutics might rely – at least in part – on the selection of the
appropriate animal stroke model to use. This review deals with
the most common rodent stroke models and also discusses the
advantages and limitations of each model, as well as factors
influencing the outcome of the model (Table 1).

Selection of animals for ischemic
stroke
The majority of stroke experiments are carried out in small
animals (eg, mice, rats, rabbits). The use of small animals
presents clear advantages – lower cost and greater acceptability from an ethical perspective – compared to larger
animals. The rat is one of the most commonly used animals
in stroke studies for many reasons: the cerebral vasculature
and physiology of the rat is similar to that of humans;11 its
moderate body size allows easy monitoring of physiologic
parameters; its small brain size is well suited to fixation
procedures (eg, in vivo freeze trapping for biochemical
analysis);12 there is a relative homogeneity within strains;13
and most of all, it is easy to conduct reproducible studies.
As the mouse is the most appropriate animal in which genetic
modifications can be created, it is widely used in transgenic
technology studies that assess the molecular pathophysiology
of stroke.14,15 According to the STAIR recommendations,
a positive result achieved from a drug study in a species
should always be verified in another species and should be
replicable in a further stroke model (ie, permanent and then
transient occlusion model).10

Intraluminal suture MCAo model
The middle cerebral artery (MCA) and its branches are
the cerebral vessels that are most often affected in human
ischemic stroke, accounting for approximately 70% of
infarcts.16 Thus, techniques that occlude this artery are closest
to human ischemic stroke.17–19 Among the occlusive MCA
stroke models, intra-arterial suture occlusion of the MCA
(MCAo) is the most common method in rodents, which has
been used in .40% of approximately 2,600 experiments on
neuroprotection after ischemic stroke.20
Technically, the MCAo model is less invasive and does
not require craniectomy and thus avoids damage to cranial
structures. This technique involves temporarily occluding
the common carotid artery (CCA), introducing a suture
directly into the internal carotid artery (ICA), and advancing
the suture until it interrupts the blood supply to the MCA
(Figure 1). In a modified manner, the suture is inserted into
the transected external carotid artery (ECA), using the ECA
trunk as a path to advance a suture through the ICA. Laser
Doppler flowmetry can be a useful tool for ensuring complete
MCAo.21 This method enables permanent MCAo or transient
ischemia with reperfusion. The ECA approach is a better
choice for transient MCAo because it maintains the anatomic
integrity that is required for reperfusion.22
The most common durations of MCAo using a suture
are 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 120 minutes, or permanent
MCAo in rats; the success rate of inducing an infarction is
88%–100%22 and that of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
is 12%.21 In mouse models, the success rates of SAH and

after transient MCAo of 60 minutes are similar to those of
rats.22,23 Depending on the duration of MCAo, this method
leads to territorial infarction in rats, involving the striatum
and the overlying frontoparietal and temporal cortices, as
well as some portion of the occipital cortex, but also induces
infarction in the thalamus and hypothalamus.24 Infarction
after MCAo follows an almost stereotypical progression
from early ischemia in the striatum to delayed infarction in
the cortex overlying the striatum. The MCA branches supplying the striatum are end arteries, which – in contrast
to the cortical branches – do not form collaterals with the
adjacent vascular territories.25 Interestingly, cerebral blood
flow (CBF) in cortical branches returns to baseline values
within 120 minutes of reperfusion, whereas CBF values in
the striatum remain depressed.26 These observations might
support findings that striatal infarction in rats is resistant to
most neuroprotective agents.27 The underlying mechanism
of reduced CBF in the striatum compared to the cortex is not
yet understood in detail; an obstructive effect of adhesive
leukocytes in the cerebral microvasculature has been suggested to contribute to this finding.28
In mice, infarction involves a substantial proportion of the
hemisphere (including most of the cortex, striatum, thalamus,
hippocampus, and subventricular zone) and is similar to that
of rats undergoing MCAo.29,30 The extent and distribution
of ischemic injury is highly sensitive to increasing occlusion duration in mice; the difference between 15  minutes
and 30 minutes of MCAo results in a fivefold increase in
infarct volume (9±2 mm3 vs 56±6 mm3) and also includes

regions outside the MCAo territory.30 No ischemic lesions
are observed in mice subjected to MCAo below or equal
to 10 minutes, whereas an MCAo of 15 minutes leads to a
detectable infarction.31
Reproducibility of infarction is affected by different factors, such as suture diameter (3-0 or 4-0 sutures for rats; 6-0
sutures for mice). It has been shown that the size of the suture
correlates well with the volume of infarct.32 Insertion length
of the suture also influences infarct size and may vary from
18 mm to 22 mm in rats, depending on the age of the animal,
rat strain, and suture tip.33 When the suture is positioned
15–16 mm from the CCA bifurcation, only the hypothalamic
and anterior choroidal arteries are occluded, leading to small
subcortical infarcts that might be a potential model of lacunar
stroke.34 Sutures coated with silicone35 or poly-l-lysine36
adhere better to the adjacent vascular endothelium than
uncoated sutures and thus cause larger infarcts and reduce
inter-animal variability compared to uncoated sutures. 36
Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between siliconecoating length and infarct size – that is, a silicone-coating
length of 2.0–3.3 mm is required to completely occlude the
MCA in rats; a coating length .3.3 mm results in additional
occlusion of the anterior choroidal artery, posterior cerebral
artery, and hypothalamic artery.37
A large body of literature suggests that infarct size is
affected by different rat and mouse strains,13,38–43 whereas
the extension of the penumbra (as measured by magnetic
resonance perfusion/diffusion-weighted imaging mismatch)
is independent of rodent strains.44 MCAo in spontaneously
hypertensive rats (SHRs) and stroke-prone SHRs results
in relatively large infarcts,38,45 with low variation in size.
In contrast, Sprague–Dawley rats exhibit small infarct
volumes40 with considerable variability,38 which is even
dependent on the choice of vendor.46 It is of note that the
strain most commonly used in preclinical stroke studies is
Sprague–Dawley;47 approximately 60% of all neuroprotection data come from this strain.20 A recently published
meta-analysis found that the Wistar strain yielded the lowest
variability of infarct size.13 Mouse strains also exhibit profound differences in infarct volume after MCAo. C57Bl/6
mice are reported to develop larger infarct volumes than
Sv129 mice when subjected to permanent MCAo.29,48 Strain
differences in arterial collaterals and excitotoxic cell death
might partially contribute to these interstrain differences.49
In the brain, pial collateral number and diameter vary by
35-fold and fourfold, respectively, among 21 inbred mouse
strains; additionally, collaterals are highly heritable.50 This
genetic-dependent variation in collaterals has been identified

as a major factor underlying differences in ischemic tissue
injury.51 However, certain mouse strains share similar collateral vessel anatomy but exhibit significantly different infarct
volumes after permanent (distal) MCAo. This finding might
be associated with two novel gene loci, Civq4 and Civq7,
which have been suggested to be involved in collateral-independent infarct evolution.52 Furthermore, the age and weight
of animals also play a crucial role as arterial dimensions/
diameters vary with age. The optimal suture diameter for rats
weighing 275–320 g is approximately 0.38 mm for silicone
rubber-coated monofilaments.53 In mice, a 15 g increase in
body weight can result in a doubling of the required thread
diameter, from 100 m to 200 m.54
The MCAo model has several advantages: First, this
model mimics human ischemic stroke, which often originates from an MCAo, and exhibits a penumbra that is similar to that of human stroke. Furthermore, the MCAo model
is characterized by large infarct volumes and high reproducibility. The reperfusion and thus the duration of ischemia
is precisely controllable. Additionally, the procedure is
relatively easy to perform and not time-consuming. The
MCAo model is considered to be suitable for reproducing
ischemic stroke and subsequent neuronal cell death, cerebral
inflammation, and blood–brain barrier (BBB) damage, as
well as producing good results in behavior tests.20 However,
this technique may lead to inadequate MCAo, depending
on the type of suture, or may be followed by vessel rupture
and subsequent SAH. These shortcomings can be solved
by using a silicone-coated suture and laser Doppler-guided
placement of the suture; the latter might reduce the incidence of subarachnoid bleeding.21 In MCAo of 60-minute
duration, hypothalamic damage is always seen,55 whereas
it rarely occurs in human stroke. Hypothalamic ischemia
results in a hyperthermic response in rats that persists for
at least 1  day after MCAo55 and thus may affect further
analysis. Hypothalamic damage is also observed in mice
after MCAo, but the surface/volume ratio of the mouse leads
to temperature loss in the postoperative period.56 There are
also concerns with regard to the different pathophysiologies of the permanent and transient MCAo model.57 In the
transient MCAo model, primary core damage may recover,
and a secondary delayed injury evolves after a free interval
of up to 12 hours. This is a long therapeutic window that is
not seen in human stroke. In contrast, the permanent MCAo
is characterized by primary core damage that expands in
peripheral brain regions and achieves its maximum at
approximately 3  hours after MCAo.57 Thus, due to the
two different pathophysiologies, unequal results may be

expected from the permanent and transient MCAo model,
which has been suggested to contribute to the failure of
neuroprotective agents in clinical trials.

Craniectomy model
This method includes direct surgical MCAo requiring a
craniectomy and section of the dura mater to expose the
MCA. There are two main distal occlusion models of the
MCA. The first technique involves separating the parotid
gland and temporalis muscle, transecting the zygomatic arch,
and removing the skull overlying the MCA.19 The MCA is
occluded by electrocoagulation and additional transection,
resulting in permanent occlusion,19 or alternatively by a
microaneurysm clip, hooks (used to lift the MCA from the
brain surface until blood flow is interrupted), ligatures, or
photochemical MCAo in mice.58–61 The second technique –
the so-called three-vessel occlusion (3VO) model – involves
the additional occlusion of both CCAs, which reduces the
collateral blood flow and thus consolidates the ischemic
damage.62 The infarct size varies depending on whether the
MCA and CCAs are permanently or transiently occluded.63
Cerebral ischemia induced by this method compromises
most of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and rostral occipital
cortices, the underlying white matter, and a marginal part of
the striatum.59 This technique avoids the thalamic, hypothalamic, hippocampal, and midbrain damage seen in the suture
MCAo model. Compared to the suture MCAo model, this
procedure induces smaller infarcts.
The main advantages of this model are good reproducibility in infarct size and neurologic deficits, low mortality,
and visual confirmation of successful MCAo. Additionally,
this technique allows subsequent reperfusion of ischemic
tissue. The main disadvantage is the craniectomy technique,
which may lead to injury of the underlying cortex or rupture
of a vessel by drilling or electrocoagulation. Furthermore, this
procedure affects intracranial pressure and BBB function, and
requires significant surgical skills to be performed. In order to
overcome this limitation, Sugimori et al suggested inducing
distal MCAo using a photochemical approach through the
intact skull of the mouse.61

Photothrombosis model
The photothrombotic stroke model is based on intravascular photo-oxidation, which leads to well-defined ischemic
lesions in the cortex64 and modifications in the striatum.65
A photoactive dye (eg, Rose bengal, erythrosin B) is injected
intraperitoneally (mice)66 or intravenously (rats),64 and the
intact skull is irradiated within minutes by a light beam at

Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2015:9

Animal models of ischemic stroke

a specific wavelength.64 This procedure generates oxygen
radicals that lead to endothelial damage, platelet activation,
and aggregation in both pial and intraparenchymal vessels
within the irradiated area. This model is further characterized by rapid progression of ischemic cell death.67 The area
of irradiation can be determined using stereotactical coordinates, which enable the cerebral ischemia to be induced in a
desired region. Further advantages of the photothrombotic
model are the minimal surgical intervention required, the
high reproducibility of the lesion, and the low mortality.
Disadvantages of this model are due to its end-arterial
occlusive nature. The rapidly evolving ischemic damage and
the endothelial injury at the same time are associated with
early cytotoxic (intracellular) and simultaneous vasogenic
(extracellular) edema formation;68 in addition, only a little or
no ischemic penumbra and local collateral flow/reperfusion
occur in this model. These pathomechanisms are different
from those seen in human stroke, in which the cytotoxic
edema is a hallmark of acute cerebral ischemia.69 However,
modifications of photothrombosis-induced stroke have been
developed, using a circular laser beam and modified irradiation parameters.70 The ring interior zone is characterized by a
hypoperfusion and thus might mimic ischemic penumbra or
“tissue at risk”,71 although there are some concerns regarding this concept.27 Recently, photothrombotic stroke models
were modified to induce an infarct in the striatum65 or in the
internal capsule of rats72 using a stereotactically implanted
optic fiber. The aforementioned photothrombotic model is an
example of white matter infarction and resulted in damage to
the internal capsule that produced prolonged motor deficits.72
Recently, induction and imaging of photothrombotic stroke
in conscious and freely moving rats has been demonstrated;73
this technique allowed real-time CBF monitoring without the
influence of anesthetics. Photothrombotic ischemia has also
been established in freely moving mice in order to investigate
the link between the development of motor cortex ischemia
and motor deficits.74
Although the photothrombotic ischemic stroke model has
some limitations, this procedure allows ongoing processes in
the perilesional area and the contralateral cortex to be elucidated and helps to gain a better understanding of neuronal
repair after stroke. Harrison et al have used the photothrombotic stroke model to study the functional organization of
the sensorimotor cortex at multiple time points before and
after stroke.75 They were able to demonstrate the feasibility
of longitudinal sensorimotor mapping and characterized
the spontaneous cortical reorganization that occurs in the
absence of any intervention in mice. Such a detailed analysis

of pathogenetic processes would be more difficult with stroke
models of large infarction with variable extension.

Endothelin-1 model
Another model of focal stroke is based on the application
of endothelin-1 (ET-1). ET-1 is a potent and long-acting
vasoconstrictive peptide.76 It can be applied directly onto the
exposed MCA,77 as an intracerebral (stereotactic) injection,78
or onto the cortical surface,79 which leads to a dose-dependent
ischemic lesion with marginal ischemic edema.78,79 The first
two modes of delivery produce an ischemic lesion comparable to that induced by permanent MCAo,80 whereas a cortical injection provides a semicircular infarct that involves all
cortical layers.79 The vasoconstrictive property of ET-1 was
also used to establish a model of white matter ischemia in the
internal capsule81 and anterior cerebral artery occlusion.82 The
latter resulted in ischemic infarction of the medial prefrontal
cortex and the anteromedial basal forebrain, and thus led to
executive impairments.82 After ET-1 administration, a rapid
CBF reduction (70%–90%) is seen, followed by a reperfusion that occurs over several hours.83 It should be noted that
ET-1 is approximately four times more potent in conscious
rats than in anesthetized rats.84 Advantages of the ET-1
model are the less invasive technique, the low mortality, as
well as the possibility of inducing direct focal ischemia in
deep and superficial brain regions. However, this model is
limited by the fact that ET-1 receptors and ET-1-converting
enzyme are also expressed by neurons and astrocytes.85 ET-1
has been shown to induce astrocytosis and facilitates axonal
sprouting,86 which may interfere with the interpretation of
neural repair experiments.27

Embolic stroke model
Embolic stroke models can be divided into two categories:
microsphere-/macrosphere-induced stroke models and thromboembolic clot models. The microsphere model involves
spheres with a diameter of 20–50 µm of different materials
such as dextran, supraparamagnetic iron oxide, TiO2, and
ceramic.87 The procedure involves inserting microspheres
into the MCA or ICA via the ECA using a microcatheter,
which are flushed passively into the cerebral circulation
by the blood flow. The microsphere-induced stroke model
results in multifocal and heterogeneous infarcts.88 The lesion
size increases slowly up to 24 hours after injection.89 The size
and dose of the injected microspheres can be used to regulate
the extent and severity of the resulting lesions.90 The brain
has good tolerance levels for microembolization in animals:
showers of microemboli can be created in the rat cerebral

vasculature, with development of only a few small areas of
injury.91 The macrosphere model uses spheres with a diameter
of 100–400 µm, which are instilled into the ICA. The intraarterial embolization of macrospheres provides reproducible
occlusion of the MCA main stem, resulting in focal ischemic
lesions that are comparable to the suture MCAo model.88
In contrast to the MCAo model, this technique preserves the
blood supply to the hypothalamus and thus avoids hypothalamic infarctions and subsequent hyperthermia.
The thromboembolic clot model is based on the application
of spontaneously formed clots or thrombin-induced clots from
autologous blood.92,93 Another method of inducing clots is to
inject thrombin directly into the intracranial segment of the
ICA94 or into the MCA.95,96 This model mimics more closely
the mechanism of vascular occlusion that is seen in a large
proportion of human strokes and therefore allows the study
of thrombolytic agents alone97 or combined with neuroprotective drugs,98 as well as thrombolytic processes such as the
development of lesion size.99 The volume and localization of
infarcts in the thromboembolic clot model depend on the size
and elasticity of the clot.100 However, infarct volume in this
model is smaller and more variable compared to an ischemic
lesion due to suture MCAo.101 Within 1 hour after clot injection, reopened microvessels in the cortex may be found. By
3 hours, cortical vessels are observed; striatal vessels clear by
24  hours,102 probably due to endogenous thrombolysis,93 or
thrombus extravasation.103 Thus, the composition and stability of the thromboembolic clots are important in avoiding
spontaneous clot dissolution.93,100 Disintegration of clots and
recanalization of occluded vessels depend on the concentration
of thrombin and erythrocytes in the clots.97 Interestingly, the
fibrinolytic systems in rats are tenfold less sensitive to rtPA than
the human system,104 and thus seem to require a tenfold higher
dose (10 mg/kg) of rtPA to achieve successful thrombolysis.
However, recently published data provide evidence that a dose
of 0.9 mg/kg rtPA is also appropriate for preclinical stroke
studies in rodents.105 Furthermore, a dose of 10 mg/kg shows a
loss of effectiveness beyond 4 hours after stroke, and increases
infarct volume as well as hemorrhagic transformation.106
Intravascular installation of clots often leads to multifocal infarcts, with significant variability in lesion volume and
localization; furthermore, a high degree of autolysis results
in early and uncontrollable reperfusion.93,102 Therefore, this
model is not suitable for validating neuroprotective effects.
Additionally, the rate of cerebral hemorrhage and mortality
is high.96 Previous analyses of clots induced by the thrombin
injection model in mice have revealed that they are mainly
composed of polymerized fibrin containing a low number

of cells and platelets,95 and thus differ from human clots
after thromboembolic stroke: approximately 75% of these
clots demonstrate platelet/fibrin accumulation, neutrophil/
monocyte deposition, and a significant accumulation of erythrocytes.107 It remains to be seen whether further improvements of the clot model might provide the opportunity to
study more precisely the effect of reperfusion strategies in
animal models.

Conclusion
In the last three decades, significant progress has been made
in understanding the pathophysiology that underlies ischemic
stroke. Several studies have shown that the ischemic cascade has many intervening and interlinking steps that have
provided a number of potential drug targets, as discussed in
Moskowitz et al.108 A large number of agents have revealed
neuroprotective efficacy in preclinical studies but have failed
to translate to efficacious therapies, irrespective of whether
neuroprotective drugs were administered as a single agent8 or
in combination.9 This is probably due to shortcomings in the
design and conduct of both clinical and preclinical studies.109
This raises the question as to what extent the choice of animal
stroke model might contribute to this failure. In the permanent
MCAo model, the infarcted core expands into more peripheral regions supplied by the MCA and reaches its maximal
size within 3  hours. This time is the therapeutic window,
during which infarct expansion can be alleviated.57 In the
transient MCAo model, recirculation results in an immediate
reoxygenation of the ischemic tissue and prompts recovery
of energy metabolism in the infarcted core. However, after
an interval of 6–12  hours, secondary delayed cell death
develops in the region of primary energy failure,57 which can
be alleviated by numerous interventions during the interval
between primary and secondary tissue damage. In contrast,
the therapeutic responsiveness of permanent focal stroke in
humans declines significantly within 3  hours after stroke
onset. Thus, a stroke model with prompt reperfusion (ie, a
long therapeutic window) might be critical when attempting
to translate these results achieved through this method to
clinical studies. Although thrombolytic trials have always
emphasized the importance of timing, there has rarely been
the same emphasis in clinical trials of neuroprotection. This
discrepancy is well illustrated by analysis of the animal and
human study data for tirilazad, in which the median time to
successful treatment in animal experiments was 10 minutes,
whereas in unsuccessful human trials, it was approximately
5 hours.110 Another major problem of animal stroke models is
that studies are mostly conducted in young animals without

any comorbidity. These models differ from human stroke,
which particularly affects elderly people who have a multiplicity of cerebrovascular risk factors. However, optimizing the study design of preclinical trials might increase the
translational potential of animal stroke models.
