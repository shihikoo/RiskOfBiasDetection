Telmisartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker with high lipid solubility, also called
metabosartan, which exerts a special protective effect on both acute brain damage
and chronic neurodegeneration. We examined the effects of telmisartan on oxidative
stress by advanced glycation end product (AGE) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) assays and the accumulation of phosphorylated a-synuclein (pSyn) in the brain of
stroke-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SR). At the age of 12 weeks,
SHR-SR received transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 90 minutes
and were divided into the following 3 groups: the vehicle group, the low-dose telmisartan group (.3 mg/kg/day), and the high-dose telmisartan group (3 mg/kg/day,
postoperatively). Immunohistologic analysis was performed when rats were 6, 12,
and 18 months old. AGE, 4-HNE, and pSynâ€“positive cells (per square millimeter)
increased with age in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the vehicle group,
in the low-dose telmisartan group, these parameters decreased without lowering
blood pressure (BP), and in the high-dose telmisartan group, these parameters
increased with lowering BP. The present study suggests that a persistent hypertension after tMCAO caused a progressive oxidative stress with the abnormal accumulation of pSyn, and that telmisartan reduced oxidative stress and the accumulation
of pSyn without lowering BP (low dose) or improved these conditions with a reduction in BP (high dose) via its pleiotropic effects through a potential peroxisome proliferatorâ€“activated receptor gamma stimulation in the brain of SHR-SR. Key Words:

TELMISARTAN REDUCES OXIDATIVE STRESS INDUCING PARKINSONâ€™S PATHOLOGY

Introduction
Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and strokeprone SHR are genetic models that develop hypertension
spontaneously and increase reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in vessels.1,2 Treatment with antioxidant vitamins
and superoxide dismutase mimetics3,4 decreased
vascular superoxide production and attenuated the
development of hypertension in these models. Vascular
oxidative stress is also demonstrated in rats with
experimentally induced hypertension.5,6 In addition,
clinical studies demonstrated an increased production
of ROS in patients with essential hypertension.7 The
ROS are generated under conditions of brain ischemiaâ€“reperfusion, which react with proteins and lipids in brain
cells through oxidation, causing the cells to undergo necrosis or apoptosis.8-11 ROS are also involved in the
formation of hyperphosphorylated a-synuclein.12,13
Among various antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) effectively prevent a first or recurrent stroke beyond their effect of lowering blood pressure
(BP).14 Sustained blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptors with an ARB could reverse pathologic cerebrovascular
change and oxidative stress, thereby increasing cerebrovascular compliance and decreasing ischemic brain damage.9,15,16 ARBs also exert neuroprotective effects on
ischemic neuronal tissue and improve the neurologic
outcome of focal brain ischemia.17,18 Telmisartan is an
ARB with high lipid solubility,19,20 also called
metabosartan, which exerts a special protective effect on
both acute brain damage and chronic progressive
dementia. There has been, however, no study on the
long-term effects of telmisartan on both oxidative stress
and a-synuclein aggregation. We therefore examined the
effects of telmisartan in SHR with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) by both doses, namely, a
low dose without lowering BP, and a high dose with
lowering BP.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Seven-weeks-old male stroke-resistant spontaneously
hypertensive rats (SHR-SR) were provided by the Disease
Model Cooperative Research Association (Kyoto, Japan)
and placed on a basal diet. Animals were maintained for
at least 7 days before the experiment in a temperatureregulated room (23 C-25 C) under a 12 h light/dark cycle.
The rats were fasted but allowed free access to water overnight before surgery.

Ischemia/Reperfusion Model
Transient focal ischemia was induced in rats by right
middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (MCAO) at the
age of 12 weeks and a body weight of 260-280 g. Briefly,

1555

the rats were anesthetized by inhalation of a 69%/30%
(vol/vol) mixture of nitrous oxide/oxygen with 1% halothane using a face mask. A midline neck incision was
made, and the right common carotid artery was exposed.
The right MCA was occluded by insertion of 4-0 surgical
nylon threads with a silicone coating through the common carotid artery. Using this technique, the tip of the
thread occludes the origin of the right MCA. During these
procedures, body temperature was monitored with a
rectal probe and was maintained at 37 6 .3 C using a
heating pad. The surgical incision was then closed, and
the animals were allowed to recover at room temperature.
After 90 minutes of transient MCAO (tMCAO), the suture
was removed to restore blood flow (reperfusion). Cervical
surgery was performed on sham control animals but
without inserting the nylon thread. The animals were
kept at ambient temperature until sampling, with free access to water and food.

Drug Preparation
The day after MCAO at 12 weeks, the SHR-SR (n 5 51)
were divided into the following 3 groups, that is, the SHRSR vehicle group (SHR/Ve, n 5 19), the SHR-SR low-dose
telmisartan group (SHR/Low, n 5 16) in which the BP did
not fall, and the SHR-SR high-dose telmisartan group
(SHR/High, n 5 16) in which the BP fell significantly
by 30 mm Hg or more. All three groups received daily
oral doses of .5% methylcellulose (MC, 0.1 mL) only
(SHR-SR/Ve group), .5% MC plus low-dose telmisartan
(0.3 mg/kg/day), or .5% MC plus high-dose telmisartan
(3 mg/kg/day) for the subsequent 3, 9, and 15 months
until sacrifice by oral gavage, respectively. The dose of telmisartan was determined as previously described. 21,22
Telmisartan was provided by Boehringer Ingelheim
(Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany), and was given daily to
the 2 rat groups as a suspension with 5% MC in 0.1 mL
of water.
When rats were 6, 12, or 18 months old, they were transcardially perfused with 5 U/mL of chilled heparinized saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate
buffer (pH 7.6) under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital
(20 mg/250 g rat). After decapitation, their brains were
removed. All experimental procedures were approved
by the Animal Committee of the Graduate School of Medicine and Dentistry, Okayama University.

Immunohistochemistry
After the brains were removed, they were immersed
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with .1 M phosphate
buffer (pH 7.6) for 8 hours, embedded in paraffin, and
5 mm-thick sections were prepared for subsequent immunostaining. For advanced glycation end product (AGE),
4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and phosphorylated a-synuclein (pSyn) immunostainings, the brain sections were
pretreated by heating them 3 times in a 500-W microwave

1556

for 5 minutes in 10 mM (pH 6.0) citric acid buffer. These
pretreated brain sections were then immersed in .5% periodic acid to block intrinsic peroxidase, treated with 5%
normal horse serum in 50-mM phosphate-buffered saline
(pH 7.4) containing .05% Tween-20 to block any nonspecific antibody response, and were finally incubated overnight with each primary antibody. The following primary
antibodies were used in this study: monoclonal anti-AGE
antibody (1:100; Trangenic Inc, Kobe, Japan), anti-4-HNE
antibody (1:50; Japan SLC Inc, Shizuoka, Japan), and antipSyn at Ser129 antibody (pSyn, 1:500; Wako, Osaka,
Japan). A biotinylated anti-mouse antibody for AGE, 4HNE, and pSyn staining was used as the secondary antibody, and specific labeling was visualized by a Vectastain
Elite ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA). To guarantee specific staining with primary antibodies, a set of brain sections was also stained without primary antibodies.

Detection and Analyses
Stained sections were digitized with a digital microscope camera (Olympus BX-51; Olympus Optical Co,
Japan). Then, the number of AGE, 4-HNE, pSynâ€“positive
cells per 1 mm2 of the cerebral cortex in hemispheric coronal sections were counted on the right peri-ischemic
lesion (ipsilateral) side and on the contralateral left side.
Furthermore, AGE, 4-HNE, and pSynâ€“positive neurons
were quantified by counting stained cells in the CA
(cornu ammonis)1 and CA3 regions of the bilateral hippocampus and expressed as a percentage of AGE, 4-HNE,
and pSynâ€“positive neurons of the total number of neurons in those regions.
Data are expressed as the mean 6 standard deviation.
Statistical analyses were performed using an analysis of
variance with repeated measures (multiple comparisons).
Planned comparisons were used for Tukeyâ€“Kramer post
hoc analysis. A value of P less than .05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with Statcel statistical package (Statcel 2; OMS
Inc, Tokorozawa, Japan).

Results
Immunohistochemical Analyses in Peri-ischemic Lesion
AGE Staining in Peri-ischemic Lesion
AGE was already slightly labeled in the cytoplasm of
cerebrocortical cells on the ipsilateral side at 6 months
in the SHR/Ve group (Fig 1, A, a), but became much
stronger at 12 and 18 months (Fig 1, A, d, g). In the 2 other
telmisartan groups (SHR/Low and SHR/High groups),
AGE was only weakly labeled at 6 months in the cytoplasm of cerebrocortical cells (Fig 1, A, b, c), and the number of positive cells in the cerebral cortex did not increase
with age (Fig 1, A, e, f, h, i). AGE staining on the contralateral side was similar with reduced intensity.

SHR/Ve group) at 12 months, and 168.3 6 45.3
(##P , .01 versus SHR/Ve group) at 18 months (Fig 2, B).
pSyn Staining in Peri-ischemic Lesion
pSyn was weakly labeled in the nucleus and cytoplasm
of cerebrocortical cells on the ipsilateral side at 6 months
in the SHR/Ve group (Fig 3, A, a), but became much
stronger at 12 and 18 months (Fig 3, A, d, g). In the 2 other
telmisartan groups (SHR/Low and SHR/High groups),
pSyn was scarcely labeled at 6 months in the cytoplasm
of cerebrocortical cells (Fig 3, A, b, c), and the number
of positive cells in the cerebral cortex did not increase

Discussion
The present study investigated the long-term change of
oxidative stress on protein, lipid, and pSyn accumulation
in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of SHR-SR after
tMCAO (Figs 1 through 6). The results demonstrated a
progressive increase of AGE, 4-HNE, and pSynâ€“positive
cells with aging in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus
of hypertensive rats (SHR/Ve), that a low dose of telmisartan (SHR/Low) reduced such changes without
lowering BP, and that a high dose of telmisartan (SHR/
High) further improved such changes with lowering BP
(SHR/High).

The SHR develops progressive neurobehavioral
impairment23 with several Alzheimerâ€™s disease risk factors such as chronic hypertension,24 metabolic syndrome
with insulin resistance,25 and immune alterations.26 Previous studies demonstrated that oxidative stress was
increased in SHR1 and stroke-prone SHR.27 However,
oxidative stress and the expression of pSyn in SHR-SR
have never been studied yet.
ROS and their detrimental effects on the brain after
transient ischemia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic injury.8,9,11 ROS, which are generated
under conditions of brain ischemiaâ€“reperfusion, react
with proteins and lipids in brain cells through

oxidation, causing the cells to undergo necrosis or
apoptosis.9,10 We previously showed that oxidative
stress sensor proteins Keap1/Nrf2 were transiently
induced until 8 hours after tMCAO, and then returned
to the normal level in normotensive Wistar rats.28 On
the other hand, the present study demonstrated that
downstream oxidative stress (AGE and 4-HNE) in the cerebral cortex progressively increased after tMCAO in
SHR-SR (Figs 1 and 2). The present study suggests that
a persistent hypertension (SHR-SR) caused a strong
progressive oxidative stress, and the number of AGE
and 4-HNEâ€“positive cells increased beyond the affected
MCA territory (hippocampus) (Figs 4 and 5).

a-Synuclein is a synaptic protein involved in synaptic
plasticity and neurodegeneration, both of which are highly influenced by aging. It is predominantly expressed in
the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, substantia nigra, thalamus, and cerebellum. The pivotal function of a-synuclein under normal condition remains unclear. However,
a mutation or triplication of the gene causes Parkinsonâ€™s
disease, and a â€˜â€˜Lewy bodyâ€™â€™ inclusion appears in neurons
of Parkinsonâ€™s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. aSynuclein is normally unfolded and predominantly nonphosphorylated in vivo.29 In aging human brains30 and in
synucleinopathies, however, a significant fraction of
aggregated a-synuclein is abnormally phosphorylated at

Ser129. Although the molecular mechanisms of phosphorylation of a-synuclein and its aggregation progress
are unclear, most of Lewy bodies and protein inclusions
contain nitrated and oxidized a-synuclein indicating
that oxidative stress partly participates in the aggregation
of a-synuclein and formation of the inclusion body.13 The
present study suggests that long-lasting oxidative stress
after tMCAO caused by persistent hypertension induced
abnormal accumulation of pSyn not only in the cerebral
cortex but also in the hippocampus (Figs 3 and 6).
Telmisartan, a highly lipid-soluble angiotensin type 1
receptor blocker, is used in hypertension to reduce BP
as a partial agonistic effect on peroxisome proliferatorâ€“
activated receptor gamma. Previous studies reported
that telmisartan reduced oxidative stress in retinal

neurons31 and endothelial cells,32,33 and showed the
neuroprotective effects by reducing angiotensin type 1
receptor signaling with upregulating type 2 signaling34
and increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor.31 In
the present study, a low-dose of telmisartan reduced
oxidative stress and pSyn accumulation without lowering
BP (Figs 1-6), suggesting a direct protective effect of
telmisartan without lowering BP (SHR/Low).

Conclusions
The present findings suggest that a persistent hypertension condition after tMCAO in SHR-SR caused a
