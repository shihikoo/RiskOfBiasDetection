Background and Purpose—Histone deacetylases (HDACs) 4 and 5 are abundantly expressed in the brain and have been
implicated in the regulation of neurodegeneration. Under physiological conditions, HDACs 4 and 5 are expressed in the
cytoplasm of brain cells where they cannot directly access chromatin. In response to external stimuli, they can shuttle to
the nucleus and regulate gene expression. However, the effect of stroke on nuclear shuttling of HDACs 4 and 5 remains
unknown.
Methods—Using a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion, we examined the subcellular localization of HDACs 4 and
5 in the peri-infarct cortex during brain repair after stroke.
Results—Stroke significantly increased nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactivity in neurons, but not in astrocytes or in
oligodendrocytes, of the peri-infarct cortex at 2, 7, and 14 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurons with
nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactivity distributed across all layers of the peri-infarct cortex and were Ctip2+ excitatory
and parvalbumin+ inhibitory neurons. These neurons were not TUNEL or BrdU positive. Furthermore, nuclear HDAC4
immunoreactivity was positively and significantly correlated with increased dendritic, axonal, and myelin densities as
determined by microtubule-associated protein 2, phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain, and myelin basic protein,
respectively. Unlike HDAC4, stroke did not alter nuclear localization of HDAC5.
Conclusions—Our data show that stroke induces nuclear shuttling of HDAC4 in neurons in the peri-infarct cortex, and that
increased nuclear HDAC4 is strongly associated with neuronal remodeling but not with neuronal cell death, suggesting
a role for nuclear HDAC4 in promoting neuronal recovery after ischemic injury.   (Stroke. 2015;46:1909-1915. DOI:

troke is a leading cause of morbidity and long-term disability in the United States and worldwide.1 Therefore, a
tremendous need exists for the development of new therapies
for stroke. Patients with stroke exhibit spontaneous recovery
at the behavioral level within the first 3 months after ischemic
injury.2 Studies from experimental stroke demonstrate that
during stroke recovery, endogenous processes of neuronal
remodeling such as axonal sprouting and formation of new
cortical connections are induced in the area adjacent to the
infarct border.3–5 Clearly, endogenous mechanisms are not sufficient to restore full neurological function; however, preclinical data in rodents suggest that amplification of endogenous
brain repair processes can lead to improved functional outcome after stroke.6 Investigating the molecular mechanisms
underlying neuronal remodeling after ischemic injury can
help in identifying new targets for neurorestorative therapy
for stroke.
Epigenetic post-translational modifications of histone
proteins, such as lysine acetylation and deacetylation, play

a major role in the regulation of gene transcription in neurons.7,8 Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a large family of
enzymes that regulate histone acetylation levels by catalyzing
the removal of acetyl moieties from lysine residues in histone
tails. Histone deacetylation consequently leads to compaction
of chromatin and gene repression.9,10
HDACs are classified into 4 major classes (I–IV) based on
homology to yeast enzymes.11 Class II HDACs are mammalian histone deacetylase 1–like proteins that include HDACs
4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10. On the basis of their structure, we subdivided class II HDACs into 2 subclasses: class IIa (4, 5, 7, and
9) and IIb (6 and 10).12,13
Two isoforms of class IIa HDACs (4 and 5) are abundantly expressed in the brain14,15 and have been implicated in
the regulation of neurodegeneration,16–19 synaptic plasticity,
and memory formation.20,21 Constitutive HDAC4 knockout
mice are not viable and die within 2 weeks of birth because of
severe skeletal malformations,22 whereas conditional loss of
HDAC4 in the forebrain leads to impaired motor coordination,

learning, and memory.20 Interestingly, conditional HDAC5
knockout mice do not display similar dysfunctions in learning and memory,20 indicating that despite their similarity in
structure, HDACs 4 and 5 play nonredundant roles in neurons.
HDACs 4 and 5 are predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm,15 where they cannot directly access chromatin; however, in response to external stimuli, they can also shuttle to
the nucleus.23–25 For example, previously published studies
showed that under physiological conditions HDAC4 is localized to the cytoplasm of cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs),
but shuttles to the nucleus when CGNs are treated with nondepolarizing media.16,17
To our knowledge, no information is available about
whether stroke affects the subcellular localization of class
IIa HDACs. We hypothesized that ischemic conditions may
stimulate nuclear shuttling of HDACs 4 and 5. Therefore, in
the present study, using a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia, we investigated whether stroke induces nuclear shuttling of HDACs 4 and 5 in neurons in the peri-infarct brain.
Furthermore, we also examined whether nuclear shuttling of
HDACs is associated with apoptosis or promoted remodeling
of neurons after ischemia.

Methods
All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Henry Ford Hospital.

Animal Model
Adult male Wistar rats (270–300 g; n=6 per group) were subjected to
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by advancing
a 4-0 surgical nylon suture with an expanded tip.26 Sham-operated
rats were used for control. Rats were injected once daily with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Methods in the online-only Data Supplement)
and euthanized at 2, 7, and 14 days after surgery.

Tissue Preparation, Immunohistochemistry, and
TUNEL Assay
The brains were fixed by transcardial perfusion with saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde before being embedded in paraffin

(Methods for immunhistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling [TUNEL] assay are available in
the online-only Data Supplement).

Image Acquisition and Analysis
Laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 NLO, Carl
Zeiss, Germany) was used for 3-dimensional imaging. For quantification, coronal sections were digitized under a ×20 or ×40 objective
of an epifluorescence microscope (Axiophot, Carl Zeiss, Inc) via a
Micro Computer Imaging Device system (Imaging Research Inc). Six
to 8 fields of view were acquired from the peri-infarct cortex (≤500
μm from the lesion border; Figure 1D). For comparison, additional
fields of view from homologous areas were acquired from shamoperated rats and contralateral cortex. Immunoreactive cells were
counted using National Institutes of Health ImageJ software, and immunoreactive areas were calculated using Micro Computer Imaging
Device imaging analysis system.

Statistical Analysis
One-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni test was used for data
analysis. Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated among histological measurements
and their correlation with nuclear HDAC4. All values are presented
as mean±SE for illustration.

Results
Stroke Induces Nuclear Shuttling of HDAC4 in
Neurons
To examine whether stroke induces nuclear shuttling of HDAC4
in neurons during brain repair, rats were euthanized at 2, 7, and
14 days after MCAO and double immunohistochemistry was
performed with antibodies specifically against HDAC4 along
with microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (p-NFH). In the cortex of sham-operated rats, immunoreactivity of HDAC4 was
mainly localized to MAP-2+ neuronal cytoplasm and dendrites
(Figure 1A), but not to p-NFH+ axons (Figure I in the onlineonly Data Supplement). However, after MCAO, we found a
robust increase in HDAC4 immunoreactivity in nuclei of neurons in the peri-infarct cortex (Figure 1A and 1D). Quantitative

HDAC4 immunoreactivity in sham-operated rats
was mainly localized to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2)+ cytoplasm (arrows) and dendrites
(arrowheads) of cortical neurons. However, after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), HDAC4
immunoreactivity was mainly detected in nuclei of
MAP-2+ neurons in the peri-infarct cortex. Images

2, 7, and 14 days after MCAO compared with sham.

analysis of HDAC4/MAP-2 immunoreactive cells at multiple
time points after MCAO revealed a temporal dynamic increase
in the percentage of nuclear HDAC4+ neurons after stroke when
compared with sham (P<0.05; Figure 1B). Concomitantly,
stroke-induced nuclear expression of HDAC4 was accompanied
by a significant (P<0.05) decrease in HDAC4 immunoreactivity
in neuronal dendrites over the same period (Figure 1C). We did
not detect a significant increase in nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactivity in MAP-2+ neurons in contralateral homologous areas
of the cortex (31±5% at 2 days, 32±5% at 7 days, and 27±2% at
14 days after MCAO versus 27±3% in sham; P>0.05). Together,
these data show that stroke induces nuclear shuttling of HDAC4
in neurons in the peri-infarct cortex.

Stroke Induces HDAC4 Shuttling Across Cortical
Layers in Interneurons and Pyramidal Neurons
Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

The cerebral cortex is composed of 6 layers that are mainly
composed of pyramidal neurons (excitatory) and interneurons (inhibitory).27 We used HDAC4/MAP-2 double immunohistochemistry to examine whether nuclear shuttling of
HDAC4 after stroke exhibits a specific laminar distribution
(Figure 2A; Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement).
We found that in the normal brain, HDAC4 immunoreactivity
was predominantly in the cytoplasm of neurons in both superficial (L1–4) and deep (L5–6) cortical layers. The number of
nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactive neurons in the normal cortex was low and evenly distributed throughout the superficial

and deep cortical layers. Starting 2 days after stroke, we
found a significant increase in nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactive neurons in deep cortical layers (L5–6) compared with
sham control (Figure 2A; Figure II in the online-only Data
Supplement). The percentage of nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactive neurons in deep cortical layers continued to increase
until 2 weeks after MCAO (Figure 2A; Figure II in the onlineonly Data Supplement). On the contrary, nuclear HDAC4
immunoreactivity in superficial cortical layers was delayed
and significantly increased only at 7 and 14 days after MCAO
(Figure 2A; Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement).
Together, these data show that stroke-induced nuclear HDAC4
shuttling first starts in the deep cortical layers and then it
expands to superficial layers.
To examine whether nuclear HDAC4 shuttling is induced
in a specific neuronal population after stroke, we performed
double immunohistochemistry for HDAC4 with Ctip2 (pyramidal neuron marker) and parvalbumin (interneuron marker).
We found that stroke significantly increased nuclear HDAC4
immunoreactivity in both Ctip2+ pyramidal cells (Figure 2B)
and parvalbumin+ interneurons (Figure 2C). These data suggest that stroke induces nuclear HDAC4 shuttling in both
excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the peri-infarct cortex.
Taken together, nuclear shuttling of HDAC4 after stroke
is induced in different neuronal populations across all cortical
layers, suggesting that nuclear shuttling of HDAC4 plays a
major role in regulating neuronal response to ischemia.

2 (MAP-2)+ neurons (A, sham, arrowheads for cytoplasmic HDAC4, arrows for nuclear HDAC4). At 2 days after stroke, nuclear HDAC4
was increased in neurons of deep (A; L5–6), but not of superficial (A; L2–3) cortical layers. Only at 7 and 14 days after MCAO, nuclear
HDAC4 was also detected in superficial layers (A; L2–3). Confocal composite images and quantitative data in B and C show that stroke
increased nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactivity in Ctip2+ pyramidal neurons (B, arrows) and parvalbumin+ interneurons (C, arrows). Orthogonal views of HDAC4 within nuclei of Ctip2+ and parvalbumin+ neurons are also shown (orthogonal in B and C, arrow). DAPI indicates

HDAC4, but Not HDAC5, Shuttles to Neuronal
Nuclei After Stroke
It has been reported that both HDACs 4 and 5 possess the ability to translocate between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.23,28
Therefore, we investigated whether stroke also induces
nuclear shuttling of HDAC5 in neurons. In sham-operated rats,
HDAC5/MAP-2 and HDAC5/p-NFH double immunohistochemistry showed that the subcellular localization of HDAC5

in cortical neurons was similar to HDAC4; HDAC5 immunoreactivity was also mainly localized to MAP-2+ cytoplasm
and dendrites of neurons (Figure 3A) and not to p-NFH+ axons
(Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). However,
in contrast to HDAC4, stroke did not significantly increase
nuclear HDAC5 in neurons in the peri-infarct cortex across
cortical layers at 2, 7, or 14 days after MCAO (Figure 3A).
These data suggest that stroke only induces nuclear shuttling
of HDAC4 in neurons in the peri-infarct cortex.

Stroke-Induced Nuclear Shuttling of HDAC4 Is
Specific to Neurons

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

Previously, we found that stroke induces diverse changes in
the expression profiles of individual class I and II HDACs in
oligodendrocytes.29 Using double immunohistochemistry for
HDAC4 with adenomatous polyposis coli (oligodendrocytes
marker) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (astrocytes marker),
we also examined whether stroke induces nuclear shuttling
of HDAC4 in glial cells. We did not detect nuclear HDAC4
immunoreactivity in adenomatous polyposis coli–positive oligodendrocytes or glial fibrillary acidic protein–positive astrocytes in the peri-infarct cortex (Figure 3B and 3C, 7 days after
MCAO). These data indicate that stroke-induced nuclear shuttling of HDAC4 is specific to neurons and does not occur in
glial cells of the ischemic brain.

Stroke-Induced HDAC4 Nuclear Shuttling in
Neurons Is Not Associated With Apoptosis

Figure 3. Distribution of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 5 in cortical
neurons and of HDAC4 in glial cells. In sham-operated and ischemic rats (2, 7, and 14 days after middle cerebral artery occlusion
[MCAO]), HDAC5 immunoreactivity was predominantly detected
in the cytoplasm and dendrites of microtubule-associated protein
2 (MAP-2)+ neurons (A). A bar graph shows quantitative data of
the percentage of neurons with nuclear HDAC5 immunoreactivity
(A). In glial cells of the peri-infarct cortex, HDAC4 immunoreactivity was detected only in the cytoplasm of some adenomatous
polyposis coli–positive (APC+) oligodendrocytes (B, arrows) and
not detected at all in glial fibrillary acidic protein–positive (GFAP+)
astrocytes (C, arrows). Representative images were acquired
from L5, 7 days after sham surgery or MCAO (A), L3, 7 days after
MCAO (B and C). DAPI indicates 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.
Scale bar, 20 μm.

Previous studies presented contradictory evidence on whether
nuclear HDAC4 shuttling has a positive or deleterious effect
on neuronal survival.16,17 Thus, we examined whether nuclear
HDAC4 immunoreactive neurons in the ischemic brain are
primed to die. Using immunohistochemistry for HDAC4 with
TUNEL assay for identification of DNA fragmentation, we
found that nuclear HDAC4+ cells in the peri-infarct cortex did
not exhibit TUNEL staining (Figure 4A, 7 days after MCAO),
indicating that nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactive neurons are
not apoptotic cells. In addition, we examined whether nuclear
HDAC4+ cells re-enter the cell cycle using double immunofluorescent staining with antibodies against HDAC4 and
BrdU. We found that nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactive cells
were not BrdU+ (Figure 4B, 7 days after MCAO), suggesting that nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactive neurons do not reenter an abortive cell cycle that could have led to apoptosis.30
Together, these data show that nuclear HDAC4 shuttling under
ischemic conditions in vivo is not associated with neuronal
apoptosis or abortive cell cycle re-entry.

Nuclear Shuttling of HDAC4 Is Correlated With
Increased Dendritic, Axonal, and Myelin Densities
After Stroke
Neuronal remodeling such as rewiring neuronal circuitry
and remyelination occurs in peri-infarct region during
stroke recovery.3,31 Thus, we examined whether increased
nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactivity after stroke is associated
with increased neuronal remodeling, by performing double
immunofluorescent staining for HDAC4/MAP-2, HDAC4/pNFH, and HDAC4/MBP at 2, 7, and 14 days after MCAO.

with microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), phosphorylated

(MBP). Cells with nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactivity were not terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling–positive (TUNEL+; A, arrows) or bromodeoxyuridine–positive (BrdU+;
(B, arrows). Furthermore, nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactivity after
stroke was significantly correlated to an increase in density of
MAP-2 (C), p-NFH (D), and MBP (D) immunoreactivity. Representative images were acquired from L5, 7 days after middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO; A and B) and L5, 14 days after MCAO
(C). Data used for correlation analyses in C and D were acquired
from 2, 7, and 14 days after MCAO. DAPI indicates 4',6-diamidino2-phenylindole. Scale bar, 20 μm.

Correlation analysis of the data showed that nuclear HDAC4
immunoreactivity was significantly and positively correlated
with MAP-2 immunoreactivity (an index of dendrites, r=0.71,
P<0.05; Figure 4C) in the peri-infarct cortex. In addition,
positive and significant (P<0.05) correlations were detected
between nuclear HDAC4 and p-NFH+ density (an index of
axons, r=0.69; Figure 4D), as well as MBP+ density (an index
of myelin, r=0.68; Figure 4D). Altogether, our data showed
that stroke-induced nuclear shuttling of HDAC4 in neurons in
the peri-infarct cortex was strongly associated with improved
indices of neuronal remodeling including axonal, dendritic,
and myelin densities, suggesting a positive role for nuclear
HDAC4 shuttling in promoting neuronal recovery after stroke.

Discussion
In the present study, we show for the first time that stroke
induces nuclear shuttling of HDAC4 in neurons in the

peri-infarct cortex and that nuclear HDAC4 is strongly associated with improved neuronal remodeling and not with neuronal cell death, suggesting a role for nuclear HDAC4 in
promoting brain repair after ischemic injury.
Class IIa HDACs are mainly expressed in the cytoplasm
in physiological conditions but are also able to shuttle into the
nucleus. In the nucleus, HDACs can access histone proteins
and act as epigenetic regulators.15,23–25 Interestingly, in addition to their known cytoplasmic and nuclear localizations, we
also found that HDACs 4 and 5 are expressed in dendrites of
neurons in the normal and ischemic cortex. This finding suggests a function for HDACs in dendritic outgrowth in addition
to gene regulation.
Synaptic activity in hippocampal and cerebellar granular
neurons is known to regulate the intracellular shuttling of class
IIa HDACs.23,32 Whether ischemic stimuli can similarly affect
the subcellular localization of HDACs has not been previously
explored. The present study shows that stroke induces nuclear
shuttling of HDAC4 in neurons in the peri-infarct sensorimotor cortex. The translocation of HDAC4 from the cytoplasm
to nuclei induced by stroke is specific because nuclear translocation of HDAC5 was not detected although both HDACs
are closely similar in structure (70% homology).11 Moreover,
along with increased nuclear HDAC4 shuttling after stroke, we
detected a significant decrease in dendritic HDAC4 immunoreactivity. Thus, our data strongly suggest that cerebral ischemia affects the subcellular localization of HDAC4 leading
to increased trafficking of HDAC4 from dendrites and cytoplasm into the nucleus. Although nuclear HDAC4 continued
to gradually increase ≤14 days after MCAO, dendritic HDAC4
decreased from 19% in sham to 6% to 8% at 2 days after MCAO
and remained stable afterward. This finding suggests that trafficking of HDAC4 from dendrites to the nucleus is most robust
in early stages after stroke. Possibly, a minimal level of dendritic HDAC4 is required to maintain dendritic integrity and
function. Later on, at 7 and 14 days after MCAO, the increase
in nuclear HDAC4 most likely results from increased shuttling
of HDAC4 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.
We previously reported that stroke induces diverse changes
in the expression profiles of class I and II HDACs in oligodendrocytes.29 However, the present study demonstrated that
stroke-induced nuclear shuttling of HDAC4 is neuronal specific
and is not induced in oligodendrocytes or astrocytes. In addition, examination of the laminar distribution of nuclear HDAC4
shuttling after stroke revealed that nuclear HDAC4 shuttling
starts in deep cortical layers and then expands to superficial layers. We also found that nuclear HDAC4 shuttling is not specific
to 1 neuronal population and is induced in both excitatory and
inhibitory neurons, indicating that nuclear HDAC4 may play a
major role in regulating neuronal response to ischemic injury.
The role of nuclear HDAC4 in neuronal cell death and
survival remains debated in the literature.33 The controversy
largely stems from contradictory reports on the effect of
HDAC4 shuttling in CGNs. Bolger and Yao16 reported that in
response to low potassium or excitatory glutamate conditions
that induce CGNs death, HDAC4 shuttled from the cytoplasm
to the nucleus. Nuclear HDAC4 then repressed the activity of
myocyte enhancer factor 2, a known prosurvival transcription factor and promoted neuronal apoptosis. On the contrary,

1914  Stroke  July 2015

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

Majdzadeh et al17 reported that forced expression of HDAC4
in CGNs protected them against low potassium induced apoptosis. The protective effect of HDAC4 was shown to occur
in the nucleus and mediated by preventing abortive cell cycle
re-entry through inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 1.
These reports may have yielded contradictory results because
of heavily relying on in vitro experiments.33 Therefore, in the
current study, we used an in vivo model for ischemia to examine whether endogenous stroke-induced nuclear HDAC4 shuttling is associated with cell death.
Using double immunohistochemistry, we found lack of
colocalization of nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactive neurons
with TUNEL assay and BrdU labeling, suggesting that strokeinduced nuclear shuttling of HDAC4 does not trigger apoptotic cell death or abortive cell cycle re-entry. Furthermore,
nuclear HDAC4 shuttling persists for at least 2 weeks after
stroke and is positively correlated with endogenous processes
of neuronal repair after ischemia. Surviving cortical neurons
in the peri-infarct cortex experience axonal sprouting, dendritic outgrowth, and remyelination,3,4,34 which may contribute to spontaneous functional recovery after stroke. Indeed,
our data show that nuclear HDAC4 is strongly and positively
correlated with improved indices of neuronal remodeling
including dendritic, axonal, and myelin as determined by
MAP-2, p-NFH, and MBP densities, respectively. These findings highlight that further studies are warranted to show a
causative relationship between nuclear HDAC4 shuttling and
improved neurological outcome after stroke.
In summary, our data show that stroke induces nuclear
shuttling of HDAC4 in neurons in the peri-infarct cortex, and
that nuclear HDAC4 is strongly associated with improved
neuronal remodeling and not with neuronal cell death, suggesting a possible positive role for nuclear shuttling of
HDAC4 in promoting neuronal recovery after ischemic injury.
Additional studies to investigate the effects of specific blocking of neuronal HDAC4 in the ischemic brain would advance
our understanding of the mechanisms by which HDAC4 possibly promotes neuronal remodeling after stroke.

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Supplemental Methods
Bromodeoxyuridine labeling
Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analog that is incorporated into cells during DNA
synthesis, was used for S-phase labeling. Using a cumulative labeling protocol1, rats (n=
6/group) were intraperitoneally injected once daily with BrdU (50 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) for 2 or 7 consecutive days, starting 24 hours after surgery. Rats receiving a daily
BrdU injection in the 2-day and 7-day groups were sacrificed at 2 hours after the last BrdU
injection. Rats in the 14-day group were injected daily with BrdU for 7 days starting 24 hours
after surgery, and sacrificed 7 days after the last BrdU injection.
Immunohistochemistry
A series of coronal sections (6 µm thick) were obtained at the center of the lesion, corresponding
to coronal coordinates for Bregma -1 to +1 mm2. Three coronal sections were used for each
immunohistochemistry experiment. Class IIa HDACs were examined using rabbit anti-HDAC4
(1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-HDAC5 (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-microtubule-associated
protein 2 (neuronal somatodendritic marker, MAP-2; 1:400, Millipore), mouse antiphosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (axonal marker, p-NFH; 1:500, Covance), rabbit antimyelin basic protein (MBP; 1:400, Dako), rat anti-COUP-TF-interacting protein 2 (Ctip2; 1:250,
Abcam), goat anti-parvalbumin (PV; 1:5000, Swant), mouse anti-adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC; 1:20, GenWay), chicken anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:500, Aves Labs) and
mouse anti-BrdU (1:100, Dako).
Brain sections were incubated with the primary antibodies listed above and with Cy3 or FITC
(Jackson ImmunoResearch) conjugated secondary antibodies. Control experiments consisted of
staining brain coronal tissue sections as outlined above, but omitting the primary antibodies.
Counterstaining with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) allowed visualization of cells nuclei and
determination of cortical layers.
TUNEL assay
TUNEL assay for the identification of apoptotic cells was performed using the ApopTag®
Fluorescein in Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore) following the manufacturer’s manual.

and 6.

Supplemental Figure II: In superficial (L1,4) and deep (L6) cortical layers of shamoperated animals, HDAC4 immunoreactivity was predominantly detected in the
cytoplasm of MAP-2+ neurons (arrowheads). Two days after stroke, nuclear HDAC4
(arrows) was increased in neurons of deep (L6), but not superficial (L1,4) cortical layers.
Only 7 and 14 days after MCAO, increased nuclear HDAC4 immunoreactivity was also
detected in superficial layers (L1,4). Bar = 20µm.
