Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is emerging as a therapy for brain ischemia, although its beneﬁts are still
debated. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of HBO on brain damage in a rat model of
transient focal cerebral ischemia and its underlying mechanism of action. Male Wistar rats, which had
suffered 1.5 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and had a Longa's neuron score of 3,
were given pure oxygen at 3.0 atm absolute, for 60 min after the third hour of reperfusion. After 24 h of
reperfusion, rat brains were removed and studied. 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and
hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that the infarct ratio in the HBO group increased remarkably
when compared with the MCAO group. Up-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/
2) activation was detected in the HBO group because of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.
Autophagy appeared to be obstructed in the HBO group. Administration of the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126
decreased the infarct ratio and improved protein clearance by autophagy in the HBO group. Collectively,
these results suggest that HBO enlarges the area of brain damage via reactive oxygen species-induced
activation of ERK1/2, which interrupts autophagy ﬂux.

1. Introduction
Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is emerging as a treatment for ischemia;
using pure oxygen, the oxygen level in blood is increased and energy
metabolism is improved. Recently many studies have found that the
effectiveness of HBO for the treatment of brain ischemia is a pressure
of 2.5 or 3.0 atm absolute (Shin et al., 2008) maintained for 1 h, within
6 h of reperfusion (Badr et al., 2001; Lou et al., 2004; Michalski et al.,
2011; Wang et al., 2008). It has been found that HBO can lessen
ischemic damage in many conditions, and some of the mechanisms
are involved in decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced brain
edema (Matchett et al., 2009; Poli and Veltkamp, 2009; Singhal, 2007;
Sun et al., 2011; Yin et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2005). Some evidence
indicates that HBO may improve therapies for brain ischemia and
reperfusion. On the other hand, Some HBO therapy experiments have

shown that the level of oxidative stress is increased in healthy rats at
1–3 atm absolute (Oter et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2008), and in diabetic
rats at 2.4 ATA (Matsunami et al., 2011), and that HBO therapy can
even induce DNA damage in human patients at 2.5 ATA (Dennog et al.,
1999; Eken et al., 2005; Speit et al., 2002). Rink et al. (2010) reported
gene expression changes occurring in the acute ischemic rat brain
with 1.5 h of 2.0 ATA HBO treatment. However, the mechanism of
HBO therapy remains unknown.
Autophagy (macroautophagy), consisting of machinery conserved
from yeast to mammals (Klionsky and Emr, 2000; Maiuri et al., 2007;
Yang and Klionsky, 2010), is a process by which cell components
including misfolded or dysfunctional proteins are degraded and
recycled. Autophagy was once thought to be a mechanism of cell
death, but there are indeed overwhelming arguments to suggest that
autophagy has a role in protecting mammalian cells both in Vitro and
in Vivo from nutrient stress and aggregates of misfolded proteins
(Kroemer and Levine, 2008; Shen et al., 2012). Normally autophagy
can be detected at low levels, but the amount of autophagy increases
with an increase in the amounts of erroneous proteins induced by
various stimuli. Because many factors participate in autophagy

regulation, Mizushima et al. (2010) evaluated autophagy using
autophagy ﬂux. Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)
binds phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to form LC3-II during the
elongation phase of autophagy; this is an essential process and a
marker of autophagy. A selective substrate for autophagy is p62, and
its content could mirror the degradative capability of autophagy
(Ichimura and Komatsu, 2010). Importantly, activation of autophagy
can protect the rat brain from transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (tMCAO) damage, even following HBO preconditioning
(Yan et al., 2011). However, the effects of autophagy after reperfusion
with HBO treatment remain unclear. Furthermore, Corcelle et al.
(2006) found that sustained ERK1/2 activation results in autophagy
disruption during the maturation step in Vitro. It suggests that ERK1/2
activation is closely related to autophagy ﬂux. In this study we
investigated the effects of HBO on tMCAO and the relationship
between ERK1/2 and autophagy during HBO therapy after tMCAO.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. tMCAO model
Forty male Wistar rats (250–300 g) were provided by the
Center for Experimental Animals of Jilin University (Certiﬁcate
no. SCXK-(JI) 2007-0003, Grade II) and separated randomly into

sham group, MCAO group, HBO groups, MCAOþU0126 group, and
MCAOþ HBOþ U0126 group. MCAO model was established using a
modiﬁed protocol (Badr et al., 2001). Before and after surgery, rats
were allowed free access to food and water. Anesthesia was
induced with 10% chloral hydrate (0.3 mL/100 g). Rats were placed
in the supine position and a midline skin incision was made to
expose the left common carotid artery (CCA), the left external
carotid artery (ECA) and the left internal carotid artery (ICA).
Branch arteries of the ECA were electrocoagulated. A poly-L-lysinetreated nylon line (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China)
was inserted into the ECA and then directed distally up the left ICA
to a distance of 18 70.5 mm from the carotid bifurcation to
occlude the origin of the left middle cerebral artery. A rectal probe
was used to monitor the rat's body temperature. The body
temperature was maintained at 37 70.5 1C before, during and
after ischemia by means of a heating lamp. The Longa score (Longa
et al., 1989) was used to evaluate revived rats, where a score of
0 indicated no neurologic deﬁcit, a score of 1 indicated failure to
extend the left forepaw fully, a score of 2 indicated circling to the
left, a score of 3 indicated falling to the left, a score of 4 indicated
the animal did not walk spontaneously and had a depressed level
of consciousness. After 1.5 h of occlusion, rats were anesthetized
again and the nylon line was removed. In the sham group, the
thread was removed as soon as the origin of the middle cerebral
artery was reached.

A total of 40 rats were assessed by neurological score. When
the neurological score accessed was at least 3, the rats were
chosen for experiment. No rats died during the experiment.

2.2. HBO treatment
After 3 h of reperfusion, rats were subjected to 3.0 ATA with
pure oxygen for 1 h, except for 10 min during which the pressure
was increased, and 20 min during which the pressure was
decreased. All rats were killed after 24 h of reperfusion. The
detailed process is shown in Fig. 5.

2.3. U0126 injection
The ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (Sigma-Aldrich Co., USA) or vehicle
(dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) was intravenously injected at 400 μg/kg,
5 min before occlusion, using a protocol modiﬁed from that of
Farrokhnia et al. (2008). We have modiﬁed administration ways.
The femoral vein was selected in the previous report (Farrokhnia
et al., 2008). However in our study U0126 was administered via the
tail vein.

2.4. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining
Rat brains were placed into a rat brain slices mold (Alto Co.,
USA). A total of ﬁve sections were coronally sliced with 3 mm
forehead and then 2 mm per section, immersed in 1% (w/v) TTC
solution at 37 1C for 30 min in the absence of light. Images were
analyzed using a BI-2000 image analysis system (Chengdu TME
Technology Co., Ltd., China). The infarct ratio was calculated by
dividing the infarction area by the total area of the ipsilateral
hemisphere. To offset the inﬂuence of tissue edema, infarct
volume was calculated using the following equation: Corrected
infarct volume¼uncorrected infarct volume  [left hemisphere
(ipsilateral hemisphere) volume right hemisphere (contralateral
hemisphere) volume]. The % contralateral hemisphere was calculated using the following equation that corrects for edema: %
contralateral hemisphere¼corrected infarct volume/right hemisphere (contralateral hemisphere) volume  100 (Tatlisumak et al.,
2000).

2.5. Hematoxylin and eosin staining
Parafﬁn sections were dewaxed in xylene, then passed through
a decreasing alcohol gradient, stained with hematoxylin and eosin,

and passed through an increasing alcohol gradient. After further
immersion in xylene, sections were mounted with resin and
observed under a microscope (Nikon IX71, Japan).
2.6. Western blotting
The penumbra is brain tissue in which the cerebral blood ﬂow
has decreased to the point of causing electrophysiological silence
and transient but recurrent losses of membrane ion gradients and
energy metabolites (Ginsberg and Pulsinelli, 1994). Based on the
cerebral blood ﬂow data and the recovery studies with a histopathological endpoint deﬁne large parts of the neocortex as
penumbral areas (Memezawa et al., 1992).
The penumbra of cortex was dissected according to protocols
from Ashwal et al. (1998). Brieﬂy, rat brains were placed into a rat
brain slices mold (Alto Co., USA) and coronally sliced into ﬁve
sections, the second and third section was used to differentiate
core and penumbra. A longitudinal cut (from top to bottom)
approximately 2 mm from the midline through each hemisphere
was made, then a transverse diagonal cut at approximately the “2
o’clock” position was made to separate the core (from 2 o’clock to
6 o’clock, including striatum and overlying cortex) from the
penumbra (from 12 o’clock to 2 o’clock, including adjacent cortex).
Penumbra protein extracts were separated by 15% (w/v) and 12%
(w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto PVDF membranes. After blocking
with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk for 4 h, membranes were
incubated separately with primary antibody at the appropriate
dilution overnight at 4 1C. Membranes were incubated with
horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse and

anti-rabbit) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1.5 h at room temperature.
The horseradish peroxidase was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc.). All antibodies
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz,
CA), except those for LC3 and p62, which were from Abcam Plc
(Matsunami et al., 2011).
2.7. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from brain penumbra tissue using
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNAs were generated
by reverse transcription of RNA samples using the SuperScript
preampliﬁcation system (Promega, Madison, MI). The PCR
products were electrophoresed on 1% (w/v) agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and visualized using a Tanon-1600
gel image processing system (Tanon, Shanghai, China). Images
were analyzed using a GIS 1D gel image analysis system (Tanon).
All gene transcription was normalized to that for glyceraldehyde3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Primers were generated
by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. Sequences were as follows:
GAPDH (sense: 50 -GGGTGATGCTGGTGCTGAGTATGT-30 , antisense: 50 AAGAATGGGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGT-30 ); HO1 (sense: 50 -ACCCCCGAGGTCAAGCACAG-30 , antisense: 50 -TTTTCCTCGGGGCGTCTCTG-30 );

2.8. Statistical analysis

3.2. Effect of HBO treatment on autophagy ﬂux

All data are presented as the mean 7S.D. One-way ANOVA
(analysis of variance) was used to analyze data in different groups,
followed by Dunnett's post-hoc testing. For all analyses, a Po 0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Three markers of the essential phase of autophagy were detected
by western blotting. The protein levels of the initiator beclin1 were
decreased in both MCAO and HBO groups compared with levels on
the contralateral side (right brain hemisphere in the same rat). A key
protein in the elongation phase, LC3-II, was up-regulated only in the
HBO group, as was the selective autophagy substrate p62. Next, mRNA
content for these markers was examined by RT-PCR. The level of
mRNA for beclin1 did not differ among groups, but mRNA levels for
p62 was up-regulated in the HBO group (Fig. 2).

3. Results
3.1. Increased neuronal death in HBO treatment after ischemia
reperfusion
The infarct ratio measured using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) staining was greater in the HBO group compared
with the MCAO group (Fig. 1A). In H&E staining, we also observed
a greater amount of rarefaction of the damaged brain and cell
condensation in the HBO group compared with the MCAO group
(Fig. 1B). These data suggest that HBO treatment could enlarge the
area of brain damage after ischemia reperfusion.

3.3. Changes in the cortical ERK1/2 signaling pathway and oxidative
stress
The phosphorylated ERK1/2 level on the ischemic side in rats in
the HBO group was higher than that in any other group (Fig. 3A). The
levels of the three anti-oxidant molecules, heme oxygenase 1(HO1),
NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1(NQO1) and glutamylcysteine
ligase, modiﬁer subunit (GCLM), were examined at the mRNA level.

autophagy ﬂux, so cells lose the capability for maintenance of homeostasis, and, ﬁnally, neurons die.

All were increased in the HBO group, but only HO1 and GCLM were
increased in the MCAO group (Fig. 3B).
3.4. Effect of ERK1/2 inhibition on autophagy ﬂux after ischemia
reperfusion
After intravenous injection of the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126, the
infarct ratio was decreased both in the MCAO and HBO groups
(Fig. 4A). The levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2, LC3-II and p62 in
HBO group were also restored to normal levels (Fig. 4B and C).

4. Discussion
Our ﬁndings showed that HBO treatment enhanced brain
damage during ischemia/reperfusion and revealed potential
mechanisms for this effect. As described above, autophagy is a
major clearance pathway for dysfunctional proteins after MCAO.
Here, we evaluated autophagy ﬂux by studying the levels of
molecules essential for autophagy. In the initiation phase, expression of the becn1 gene (coding the autophagy initiation factor
beclin1) did not differ among groups (Fig. 2B); however, the levels
of beclin1 protein were decreased on the ischemic side in both
MCAO and HBO groups (Fig. 2A), indicating that the protein was
utilized and that initiation of autophagy ﬂux was not affected by
HBO treatment. During the elongation phase, LC3 is transformed
to LC3-II, an autophagy marker. LC3-II is degraded at the inner
autophagy membrane, but the outer portion is recycled in the
mature phase when autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes for
degradation of substrates. The accumulation of LC3-II may represent either autophagy induction, or suppression of steps in the
autophagy pathway downstream of LC3-II (Mizushima et al.,
2010). In this study, we found that the level of LC3-II on the
ischemic side in rats in the HBO group was signiﬁcantly higher
than that in rats in the MCAO group (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the
elongation phase of autophagy is not affected in either group, so
the change in levels may be related to increased autophagy or a
blockage of downstream pathways. In addition, the main autophagy substrate p62 was up-regulated at both the mRNA and
protein level (Fig. 2A and B). Our ﬁndings suggest that a component needed for degradation by autophagy is added, but that
autophagy cannot degrade the substrate because downstream
pathways are blocked. Aggregation of unfolded proteins is one
major reason for neuronal death, and we can infer from our results
that the level of dysfunctional protein is higher in neurons after

Fig. 5. Experimental protocol. (A) Rats were separated into three groups: a sham
group, in which the thread was removed as soon as the origin of the middle
cerebral artery was reached, an MCAO group, and an HBO group, in which an HBO
chamber was used after 3 h of reperfusion. (B) HBO treatment. After cleaning the
HBO chamber using pure oxygen gas, the pressure was raised to 3.0 ATA over a
period of 10 min and sustained for 1 h, then reduced to normal pressure over a
period of 20 min.

HBO treatment. Because p62 is a substrate for autophagy, if
the autophagy pathway downstream of p62 was not inhibited,
the total content in the HBO group may not differ from that in the
MCAO group. But its expression level was up-regulated in the HBO
group in our study. That is to say, downstream autophagy ﬂux was
obstructed after HBO treatment.
Therefore, we also investigated the possibility of an effect
of HBO on factors downstream of autophagy. We assumed that
ERK1/2, which is activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS)
(Keshari et al., 2013) generated from HBO (Matsunami et al.,
2011; Oter et al., 2005) could block the pathways downstream of
autophagy. If so, reactive oxygen species and proteins targeted for
degradation could not be removed, and cell death might be initiated.
To test our hypothesis, we ﬁrst assessed the levels of antioxidant molecules and found that all three indicators were
expressed in the HBO group, while only two were expressed in
the MCAO group (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that oxidative
stress levels were higher in the HBO group. These data are
consistent with the results reported in Rink et al. (2010). ERK1/2
levels, and importantly, the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2, were
higher in the HBO group than in the other groups (Fig. 3A).
Because all data were from 24 h after reperfusion, we concluded
that the ERK1/2 activation was sustained. After U0126 injection,
the infarct ratio was reduced to control levels (Fig. 4A), suggesting
that sustained activation of ERK1/2 is the main reason for neuron
death. The levels of autophagy-related molecules were also
restored to normal levels with ERK1/2 activation decreasing
(Fig. 4B and C), suggesting that sustained activation of ERK1/2
blocks autophagy ﬂux.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings provide strong evidence for a
toxicity effect of HBO on brain cortex in the penumbra of transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in the rat model. This
mechanism appears to be correlated in part to interrupting
autophagy ﬂux though activation of ERK1/2, which may be a
result of reactive oxygen species generation.
