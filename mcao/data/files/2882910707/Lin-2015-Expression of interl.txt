Abstract To investigate the temporal expressions of IL-9
and its related cytokines after middle cerebral artery
occlusion in rats. IL-9 and its related cytokines in ischemia
brain and blood were tested after rats were subjected to
transient focal ischemia. Comparing with sham-operated
group, the levels of IL-4, TGF-b, PU.1, IRF4, OX40, NIK,
RelB-p52 and IL-9 in experimental groups were significantly higher after middle cerebral artery occlusion. The
results showed that expressions of IL-9 and its upstream
stimulating factors increased in experimental stroke, and
whether they play a role or just a secondary change is
awaiting further research.

Introduction
Stroke is a main cause of morbidity and mortality both in
developing and developed countries [1]. It is already the
leading cause of death and adult disability in China [2].
Inflammation has been generally implicated as an
important mechanism underlying neuronal injury in
ischemia stroke [3, 4]. Th9 cells are a new subset of helper
T cells which play an important role in inflammatory diseases such as asthma and experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) [5–12]. Recent studies indicated
that the best cytokine mixture for Th9 cells induction was a
combination of TGF-b and IL-4 [13]. IL-4 activates
STAT6 and IRF4 while TGF-b activates PU.1 but
depresses GATA3 and T-bet, and the integration of these
events promotes the secretion of IL-9 from Th9 cells [14–
19]. However, no study has been conducted about the
effects of Th9 cells in ischemic stroke. IL-9 is the signature
cytokine secreted by Th9 cells. Thus, we investigated the
kinetic changes of IL-9 and its upstream stimulating factors
in rats with experimental stroke to find out whether they are
involved in stroke.

Materials and methods
Animals
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g
were obtained from Experimental Animal Center of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (Certificate
Number: SCXY-YUE-2013-0020). All rats were housed in
SPF grade animal room with temperature of 25 ± 2 °C and
relative humidity of 60 % and were fed on SPF grade rat
food and sterile distilled water. All animal procedures

involving animals and their care were conducted in
accordance with the guidelines of Animal Use and Care of
the National Institutes of Health and Use of Laboratory
Animals and were approved by the Bioethics Committee of
Sun Yat-sen University.
Rat model of experimental stroke
Animal groups
Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into experimental
(n = 40) and sham-operated (n = 8) groups. The experimental groups were divided into five subgroups according
to different time points after surgical manipulation: 6 h
(n = 8), 12 h (n = 8), 24 h (n = 8), 96 h (n = 8), and
168 h (n = 8).
Animal surgery
Cerebral infarction was induced by intraluminal middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as previously described
by Longa with some modified [20]. Rats were fasted 12 h
before experimental surgery with free access to water.
Then all rats were anesthetized with 3 % pentobarbital
sodium and were allowed to breathe spontaneously. Body
temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C throughout the
surgery. The right carotid arteries were exposed through a
midline cervical incision and the common carotid and
external carotid arteries were ligated with a silk suture. An
aneurysm clip was placed across the internal carotid artery
and an arteriotomy was made in the common carotid artery
stump, allowing the introduction of a monofilament nylon
suture (SUNBIO, China). The suture was gently advanced
into the internal carotid artery until mild resistance was
felt. Reperfusion was established by gently withdrawing
the filament after 90 min of occlusion. Free access to food
and water was allowed after recovery from anesthesia. In
the sham-operated group, all steps were included except for
the occlusion of the middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO).
Infarct size determination
Rats were subjected to 1.5 h MCAO and killed 24 h after
reperfusion. The animals were decapitated and brains were
removed and kept at -20 °C for 10 min. Frozen brains
were cut into consecutive 2 mm coronal sections starting at
the frontal pole (respect to bregma). The sliced sections
were subsequently stained with TTC (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) at 37 °C for 30 min protected from light.
Finally, the stained sections were transferred into 10 %
neutral formalin buffer at 4 °C for fixing. MCAO produced
ipsilateral focal infarcts, seen as white areas by 2,3,5-

123

triphenyltetrazoliumchloride staining. The infarct areas
were photographed using a digital camera with a high
resolution. Image analysis software (NIH Image, National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Version 1.63) was applied to
the measurement of the infracted area. To eliminate the
effect of brain edema, the infarct volume was calculated
with the following formula: infarct volume = (red area of
contralateral side - red area of ipsilateral side)/total
area 9 100 % [21].

Detection of the related cytokines of Th9 cells
after MCAO
Sample preparation
Rats were deeply anesthetized at different time points after
MCAO. Blood samples were drawn from the heart of rats.
After standing for 30 min, the blood samples were centrifugated for 15 min at 3,000 r/min. The supernatant was
collected and stored at -80 °C. The peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole
blood (3 ml) by lymphocyte separation medium (Tian Jin
Hao Yang Biological Science, China). The layer with
PBMCs was removed and washed twice with saline 0.9 %
and the recovered cells were used directly for total RNA
extraction. The ischemic brain tissue was stored at -80 °C.
Cytokine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
Serum and ischemic brain tissue collected and frozen at
-80 °C were tested with commercial kits to evaluate the
concentrations of IL-4 (RayBio), TGF-b (eBioscience),
IRF4 (USCNK), PU.1 (USCNK) and IL-9 (USCNK).
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA from the PBMCs and ischemic brain tissue was
obtained by TRIzol extraction. Reverse transcription was
performed with 5 lg of total RNA. PCR amplification of
IL-4, TGF-b, IRF4, PU.1, IL-9, as well as glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as an endogenous
control, were done by Taq polymerase and the following

intensities were quantified by densitometry to observe the
target proteins.

Immunohistochemistry
Statistical analysis
Rats were deeply anesthetized at different time points
(n = 8, each group) and then were perfused transcardially
with normal saline followed by ice-cold 4 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Brain tissues were
removed and fixed overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde at
4 °C and then immersed in 30 % sucrose. They were cut to
2-mm thick coronal sections and embedded in paraffin and
further sliced at a thickness of 5 lm. Standard immunohistochemical procedures were performed according to a
previous study [22]. Embedded sections were cut to 5 lm
thick and used for immunohistochemistry with an anti-rat
monoclonal antibody against PU.1 (1:50, NBP100995,
Novus Biologicals, USA) or an anti-rat monoclonal antibody against IL-9 (1:100, BS-2428R, BIOSS, Beijing,
China). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (SA1022,
Boster, Wuhan, China) was used as the secondary antibody
(incubating for 30 min at 37 °C). Antibodies were detected
using the DAB kit (Boster, Wuhan, China) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the slides were
observed using a light microscope (MC-1180, Yuexian
Instrument Co., Ltd, Guangzhou, China). All image analyses for PU.1 and IL-9 were performed by measuring
integral optical density in Image-ProPlus (version 6.0).
Western blotting
The ischemic brain tissue of each group was taken as
samples to analyze the OX40, NIK and RelB-P52. Brain
samples were homogenized in buffer solution before centrifugation at 14,0009g. The supernatants were used to
estimate the amount of protein using an assay kit from
BCA (Pierce, USA). The supernatant (i.e., protein) was
mixed with 49 sodium dodecyl sulfate-loading dye and
boiled for 15 min at 95 °C for denaturation. Separating
(8 %) and stacking gels were prepared. Protein in buffer
(90 lg/ml) was subsequently loaded into each well for
electrophoresis. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 4 °C. The
membranes were then blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk in
phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature and
incubated with specific primary anti-bodies for OX40
(1:1,000, PAB8881, abnova, USA), NIK (1:250, ab37712,
abcam, UK), RelB-P52 (1:750, ab31409, abcam, UK).
After the membranes were washed in buffer containing
0.1 % Tween 20 in 19 phosphate-buffered saline, the blots
were incubated with specific secondary antibody (1:5,000,
AP307P, Millipore, DE, USA) and evaluated using an
enhanced chemiluminescence detection using ECL

Data are presented as mean ± SEM, and were analyzed
using one-way ANOVA. A P value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
MCAO
Middle cerebral artery occlusion induced large cerebral
infarctions (Fig. 1a). Infarct volume of brains in rats for
MCAO group was calculated (Fig. 1b).
Kinetic changes of IL-4, TGF-b, IRF4, PU.1 and IL-9
in peripheral blood after MCAO
The mRNA expression of IL-4 in PBMC was significantly
higher at 12 h after MCAO than that of the sham-operated
group (P = 0.001, Fig. 2a). Increased concentrations of
serum IL-4 were found at 12 and 24 h after MCAO compared with that of the sham-operated group (P = 0.016,
P = 0.005, respectively, Fig. 3a). Comparing with the
sham-operated group, the mRNA levels of TGF-b in PBMC
were significantly higher at 12, 24, 96, and 168 h after
MCAO (P = 0.008, P \ 0.001, P \ 0.001, P \ 0.001,
respectively, Fig. 2b). The concentrations of serum TGF-b
at 12, 24, and 96 after MCAO were significantly higher than
that of sham-operated group, respectively (P = 0.004,

were significantly higher than that of sham-operated group,
respectively (P = 0.014, P \ 0.001, respectively, Fig. 2c).
And significant differences of the mRNA levels of IRF4 in

MCAO, comparing with that in sham-operated group,
respectively (P \ 0.001, P \ 0.001, P = 0.033, respectively, Fig. 2d). Higher mRNA expressions of IL-9 were
observed at 12 and 24 h after MCAO than sham-operated
group, respectively (P \ 0.001, P \ 0.001, respectively,

168 h after MCAO were significantly higher than that of
sham-operated group, respectively (P \ 0.001, P = 0.002,
P = 0.008, respectively, Fig. 3c).
Expression of IL-4, TGF-b, IRF4, PU.1 and IL-9
in ischemic brain tissue
To prove more directly the pathogenetic involvement of the
related cytokines of Th9 cells in ischemia conditions, the
concentrations and gene expressions of IL-4, TGF-b, IRF4,
PU.1, and IL-9 in ischemic brain tissue were tested at 6, 12,
24, 96, and 168 h after MCAO. The expressions of mRNA
of IL-4, TGF-b, PU.1, and IL-9 began increasing from 12 h
after MCAO (P = 0.022, P \ 0.001, P = 0.001,
P \ 0.001, respectively, Fig. 4a–c, e). And the mRNA
levels of IL-4 and PU.1 peaked at 24 h while that of IL-9
peaked at 96 h. The mRNA levels of IRF4 began to
increase at 24 h (P \ 0.001) and then gradually decreased
(Fig. 4d). The concentrations of IL-4 in experimental
groups were found significantly higher in comparison to
sham-operated group at 12 h (P = 0.004) and 24 h
(P \ 0.001) (Fig. 5a). The levels of TGF-b in experimental

groups were found significantly higher in comparison to
sham-operated group at 12 h (P = 0.021), 24 h
(P = 0.009), and 96 h (P \ 0.001) (Fig. 5b). The level of
PU.1 at 24 h after MCAO was significantly higher than that
in sham-operated group (P = 0.008, Fig. 5c). The concentrations of IRF4 in experimental groups were found
significantly higher in comparison to sham-operated group
at 96 h (P \ 0.001) and 168 h (P \ 0.001) (Fig. 5d), while
higher levels of IL-9 were found at 96 h (P = 0.005) and
168 h (P = 0.013) (Fig. 5e).
Immunohistochemical staining of PU.1 and IL-9
in brain tissues
Immunohistochemical staining showed an elevated
expression of PU.1 and IL-9 in brain of rats with experimental stroke compared to the sham-operated group. Semiquantitative analysis indicated that there was a higher level
of expression of PU.1 at 24 h after MCAO than that in
sham-operated group (P = 0.004, Fig. 6h–n). We also
found higher level of IL-9 at 96 h (P = 0.003) and 168 h
(P = 0.013) than that in sham-operated group (Fig. 6a–g).

Expression of OX40, NIK and RelB-p52 in ischemic
brain tissue

Discussion

The expression of OX40 was higher at 12 h after MCAO
than that in sham-operated group (P = 0.002, Fig. 7a, b).
We found higher level of NIK at 24 h (P = 0.017) and
higher level of RelB–p52 at 96 h (P = 0.021) in experimental groups than those in sham-operated group (Fig. 7a,

A growing number of recent investigations have established a critical role for cytokines in the propagation of
brain tissue damage after ischemia. It was demonstrated
that the inflammatory responses contributed to the neuronal
death following stroke [3, 4].
Th9 cells are a new subset of CD4? T cells which play
an important role in inflammatory diseases. Pro-

inflammatory role of Th9 cells was found in an EAE model
[5]. Meanwhile, studies also showed that IL-9 was highly
expressed in the lungs of asthmatic patients [9, 10].
Although a study conducted by Heidi Ormstad et al. [23]
indicated that concentrations of IL-9 increased in the serum
of patients with acute ischemic stroke, no study has focused
on the expressions of IL-9 and its upstream stimulating
factors in animals with experimental stroke.
Our study indicated that the expression of IL-9 in
peripheral blood began elevating from 12 h after MCAO.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated expression of IL-9
increased in the ischemic brain tissue after MCAO, which
suggested that IL-9 might be involved in the pathogenesis
of ischemic stroke.
Th9 cells develop from Th2 cells and recent studies
indicated that the best cytokine mixture for Th9 induction
is a combination of TGF-b and IL-4. IL-4 activates STAT6
and IRF4, while TGF-b activates PU.1 and depresses both
GATA3 and T-bet. The integration of these events promotes the secretion of IL-9 [14–19]. Our results showed
elevated levels of IL-4, TGF-b, IRF-4, PU.1, and IL-9 in
peripheral blood after MCAO, which suggested a peripheral environment in favor of the induction of Th9 cells and
secretion of IL-9 after cerebral ischemia. With

immunohistochemical staining, we detected IL-9 ? and
PU.1 ? cells in the infarct brain tissue. We proposed that
the Th9 cells infiltrated into the ischemic brain from
peripheral blood and secreted IL-9, so the levels of IL-9
and PU.1 in the ischemic brain increased. Th2 cells could
also infiltrated into the ischemic brain where the levels of
TGF-b and IL-4 increased, so it is possible that part of the
Th9 cells derived from Th2 cells in the ischemic brain.
Xiang Xiao et al. [13] identified a new molecular
pathway triggered by OX40-mediated co stimulation by
which Th9 cells develop. OX40 ligation activates activities
of the non-canonical NF-jB pathway (RelB–p52), which
potently mediates Th9 cells induction by TGF-b and IL-4.
Our study found that the expressions of OX40, NIK and
RelB–p52 in ischemic brain tissue increased after MCAO,
which made it more convincing that Th9 cells were activated after ischemic stroke.
IL-9 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine which can induce
the expression of CCL20 produced by astrocyte and promote the migration of Th17 cells to central nervous system
(CNS) [24]. When treated with anti-IL-9 neutralizing Abs,
expressions of CCL20 and Th17 cells infiltrating into
central nervous system decreased [24]. The immunological
mechanisms of IL-9 and Th9 cells in ischemic stroke are
not clear, but considering the pro-inflammatory effect, IL-9

123

920

might damage brain tissue directly like other pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-1b [25–27].
Besides, it might be associated with the activation of various inflammatory cells thus augment the injury.

Conclusions
12.

In conclusion, the expressions of IL-9 and its upstream
stimulating factors increased in experimental stroke, whether they play a role or just a secondary change is awaiting
further research.
