Animals isolated after stroke had a progressive deﬁcit in sociability that worsened over time.
The protective effects of pair housing may be mediated by M2 activation of microglia/macrophages.

Social isolation (SI) has been linked epidemiologically to high rates of morbidity and mortality following
stroke. In contrast, strong social support enhances recovery and lowers stroke recurrence. However, the
mechanism by which social support inﬂuences stroke recovery has not been adequately explored. The
goal of this study was to examine the effect of post-stroke pair housing and SI on behavioral phenotypes and chronic functional recovery in mice. Young male mice were paired for 14 days before a 60 min
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham surgery and assigned to various housing environments immediately after stroke. Post-stroke mice paired with either a sham or stroke partner showed
signiﬁcantly higher (P < 0.05) sociability after MCAO than isolated littermates. Sociability deﬁcits worsened over time in isolated animals. Pair-housed mice showed restored sucrose consumption (P < 0.05) and
reduced immobility in the tail suspension test compared to isolated cohorts. Pair-housed stroked mice
demonstrated signiﬁcantly reduced cerebral atrophy after 6 weeks (17.5 ± 1.5% in PH versus 40.8 ± 1.3%
in SI; P < 0.001). Surprisingly, total brain arginase-1, a marker of a M2 “alternatively activated” myeloid
cells was higher in isolated mice. However, a more detailed assessment of cellular expression showed a
signiﬁcant increase in the number of microglia that co-labeled with arginase-1 in the peri-infarct region
in PH stroke mice compared to SI mice. Pair housing enhances sociability and reduces avolitional and
anhedonic behavior. Pair housing reduced serum IL-6 and enhanced peri-infarct microglia arginase-1
expression. Social interaction reduces post-stroke depression and improves functional recovery.

1. Introduction
Social support is one of the most recognized psychological factors inﬂuencing recovery from disease [1,2] and has the potential
to alleviate maladaptive psychological responses to stress [3]. In
contrast, social isolation (SI) exacerbates disease and slows recovery. Absence of social interaction has been linked epidemiologically
with high mortality rates following various pathological stressors

including stroke [4]. Social isolation and feelings of loneliness not
only increase the risk of death but also delay recovery [5]. Social
interaction has well -documented health beneﬁts in humans and
can be easily assessed in the clinic by tools such as the UCLA loneliness scale [6]. However, discovering the biological mechanisms
underlying the beneﬁts of social interaction requires the development of pre-clinical animal studies. Although reproducing social
behavior in mice has limitations, there are many advantages [7].
As not all strokes can be prevented, evaluating the inﬂuence of social and emotional factors on stroke recovery is an
important area of research. Depression and anxiety are common
clinical ﬁndings after stroke, with up to 40% of stroke survivors
affected [8]. These behavioral deﬁcits have been associated with
higher levels of disability and lower levels of social support [9,10].

Post-stroke depression (PSD) leads to increased cognitive deﬁcits,
sexual dysfunction, anhedonia, feelings of despair and social withdrawal [11–15]. These disturbances not only affect the overall
well-being of patients but also confound the recovery process by
leading to further isolation. SI is predicted by depressive symptomatology using the geriatric depression scale (GDS) in clinical
populations [16,17]. However, no such scale or validated behavioral paradigms to measure complex behavior changes after stroke
exists for rodent stroke models. Historically, the lack of appropriate behavioral quantiﬁcation and analysis has been a major limiting
factor in drug development for stroke [18].
Housing conditions prior to an induced stroke are a strong determinant of long-term survival in mice. Mice pair housed prior to
injury had a 100% survival rate after 7 days in contrast to a 40%
survival rate among isolated animals [19]. The detrimental effects
of social isolation on infarct volume and behavioral recovery were
evident in both sexes [20]. However, many studies have examined isolation prior to stroke, and focused on motor recovery and
survival at acute endpoints. Therefore in this study we analyzed
and validated behavioral changes after stroke in long term survival
cohorts with a focus on depressive behavior.
Emerging evidence indicates a relationship between SI and
systemic inﬂammation [19]. Clinical studies have shown that
plasma levels of inﬂammatory cytokines were increased after
stroke [21]. Immune cells, most notably resident microglia or
peripheral macrophages that migrate to the area of ischemic injury
also participate in pathological changes during stroke by releasing various pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines [22–24].
Microglia/macrophages are highly plastic cells that can assume
diverse phenotypes in response to speciﬁc micro-environmental
signals [23–25]. These macrophages and/or resident microglia may
either contribute to damage or enhance repair in the brain [25].
These divergent effects in the brain are mediated by distinct
macrophage subsets, i.e., “classically activated” proinﬂammatory
(M1) or “alternatively activated” anti-inﬂammatory (M2) cells.
Their phenotype is dependent on the cytokine environment present
during macrophage activation [23]. Myeloid cells are divided into
these two distinct phenotypes based in part upon l-arginine
metabolism. M1 (or classically activated) cells express high levels
of iNOS and low levels of arginase-1 and participate in the clearance
of intracellular pathogens. Conversely, M2 (alternatively activated)
myeloid cells express the reverse pattern, and are involved in repair
[26]. In this study, chronic behavioral changes induced by pair housing, and the potential contribution of microglia/macrophages to
post-stroke depressive phenotypes were examined.

factorial design. Surgical condition (sham (SH) or stroke (ST)), was
the ﬁrst between-subjects factor and housing condition housed
with sham (SH), housed with stroke (ST) or housed in isolation
(ISO), was the second between-subjects factor [27]. Thus, the six
groups were: SHcSH (n = 6), SHcST (n = 8), SH ISO (n = 7), STcSH
(n = 8), STcST (n = 8), and ST ISO (n = 9). Mice remained in these housing conditions throughout the experiment (Fig. 1). If any mice died
during the experiments, all of the subjects housed in the same cage
were excluded from the study. The experiments were conducted in
two separate cohorts. In the ﬁrst cohort behavioral deﬁcits (Sociability, SCT and TST tasks) were assessed at one time point, 6 weeks
after stroke. In the second cohort the mice were tested (Sociability,
SCT) weekly through 6 weeks with testing initiated at day 7 after
MCAO [number of animals/group; ST-PH (n = 10), SH-ISO (n = 6), SHPH (n = 8), and ST ISO (n = 7); detail for groups is described in Section
3.1].
2.2. Stroke model
In all stroke groups, transient focal cerebral ischemia was
induced in mice (20–25 g) by 60 min of transient right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) under isoﬂurane anesthesia followed
by reperfusion as described previously [28,29]. Brieﬂy, a midline
ventral neck incision was made, and unilateral right MCAO was
performed by advancing a 6-0 silicone-coated nylon monoﬁlament (Doccol Corporation, CA) into the internal carotid artery 6 mm
from the internal carotid artery bifurcation via an external carotid
artery stump. Rectal temperatures were monitored with a temperature control system (Fine Science Tools, Canada) and temperature
was maintained with an automatic heating pad at ∼37 ◦ C during surgery. Cerebral blood ﬂow measurements by Laser Doppler
Flowmetry (DRT 4/Moor Instruments Ltd, Devon, UK) conﬁrmed
ischemic occlusion (reduction to 15% of baseline) during MCAO and
restoration of blood ﬂow during reperfusion. In sham mice, an identical surgery was performed except the suture was not advanced
into the internal carotid artery.

2. Materials and methods
2.3. Assessment of social interaction/sociability
2.1. Experimental animals
All animal protocols were approved by the University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of
Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT and were performed in
accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Six-weekold C57Bl/6 male mice were purchased from Harlan laboratories,
USA. All mice were maintained in an ambient temperature and
humidity controlled vivarium with ad libitum access to food and
water. After arrival, the mice were acclimatized in the animal care
facility for two weeks in their original groups. Thereafter, all mice
were randomly housed in groups of 2 mice per cage for an additional
two weeks. During pair housing all the mice were examined daily
for compatibility (observed for ﬁghting, or the failure to gain weight
in either partner). After two weeks of pair housing all mice were
subjected to stroke or sham surgery. Immediately after surgery,
mice were randomly assigned to one of six groups using a two way

The three-chamber paradigm, established by Crawley and colleagues [30] has been used to examine mouse sociability in models
of autism and other psychiatric disorders. We used this paradigm
to study PSD in PH versus ISO mice with minor modiﬁcations. In
the ﬁrst cohort sociability was assessed at 6 weeks after MCAO. In
the second cohort, social behavior was tested at several time points
after stroke, each at 7 day intervals through 6 weeks with testing
initiated at day 7 after stroke.
The social testing apparatus was comprised of a rectangular, three-chambered Plexiglas box (22 in. L × 16 in. W × 9 in. H).
Dividing walls had a single rectangular opening 2W × 2L inches
in diameter allowing access into each chamber (Supp Fig. 1). Initially, the test mouse was habituated to the test chamber for 5 min.
In this habituation phase the mouse had full access to both sides
of the chamber each containing an empty round wire cage. After
this habituation period, the test mouse was returned to its home

R. Verma et al. / Behavioural Brain Research 269 (2014) 155–163

cage and the test chamber was cleaned with 70% alcohol. A stranger
mouse of the same sex that had no prior contact with the test mouse
was then placed under a round wire cage within the right chamber of the testing apparatus. The wire cage effectively allows for
nose contact between mice but prevents ﬁghting or further direct
interaction. At this point the test mouse was re-introduced into the
middle chamber and allowed to explore the entire testing apparatus for a 10 min session.
Supplementary ﬁgure related to this article can be found, in the
online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2014.04.044.
Parameters recorded include the % time spent in right chamber
(the chamber with the stranger mouse), and the total interaction
time (Time spent during direct contact between the test mouse and
the containment cup with the stranger mouse, or stretching of the
body of the test mouse in an area 3 cm around the cup) with the
stranger mouse. [31] Top scan software was used to record these
variables and to track the test mouse’s movement (Top scan, Clever
Sys Inc. Reston, Virginia).
2.4. Tail suspension test
The tail suspension test (TST) was performed as described
previously [32] with minor modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, the mice were
individually suspended from the tail suspension apparatus, 60 cm
above the surface of the table. The experiment was recorded for
6 min using a digital video camera (JVC Everio, Victor Company,
Japan). A trained observer that was blinded to the housing and surgical group then recorded the duration of immobility. The mouse
was considered immobile in the absence of initiated movement. In
general, an immobile mouse will appear to hang passively unless
it has retained momentum from a movement immediately prior to
the current bout of immobility. The testing apparatus was cleaned
between trials to remove olfactory cues.
2.5. Sucrose consumption test
The sucrose consumption test (SCT) was performed in two
separate cohorts to measure anhedonia. The SCT has been previously used to address post-stroke anhedonia [15]. In this test,
mice are presented with the option of consuming either water or
a 3% sucrose solution. A preference for sucrose is seen in naive
animals [33], whereas mice that have no preference for sucrose
solution are considered anhedonic. This is a well validated test for a
depressive phenotype, and the lack of preference for sucrose can be
restored with anti-depressant treatment [34]. Two identical 10 mL
vials were placed on a custom made wire cage top. PH mice were
temporarily separated overnight for this test to ensure an accurate
measure of consumption for each individual mouse. On the ﬁrst day
of habituation, each individual mouse was provided two 10 mL vials
of water for 12 h. The following morning, all mice were returned to
their original housing condition and provided their normal drinking
water and cage tops. That evening mice were again separated and
provided with two 10 mL vials of 3% sucrose overnight (12 h). After
completion of habituation, all PH mice were again returned to their
partners and provided their normal drinking water and cage tops.
On the day of testing, mice were water deprived in their original
housing condition for 6 h, then separated (if PH) and kept in a new
cage with the customized cage top and one 10 mL vial of water and
one 10 mL vial of 3% sucrose solution overnight (12 h). The volume
of consumption of both solutions was recorded the following day
by an observer blinded to housing condition in both cohorts as per
experimental design.
2.6. Tissue and ventricular atrophy analysis
All animals were sacriﬁced with an overdose of Avertin
(250 mg/kg i.p.) after completion of experiments. Subsequent to

157

cardiac puncture and blood collection, the mice underwent transcardial perfusion, using cold heparinized PBS followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brain was post-ﬁxed overnight in
4% PFA and placed in cryoprotectant (30% sucrose solution) for
72 h before processing. The brains were then cut into 30-␮m freeﬂoating sections on a freezing microtome and every eighth slice was
stained by cresyl violet to visualize tissue loss [20]. The slices were
photographed and ventricular and tissue atrophy were analyzed
using computer software (Sigma scan Pro5) as previously described
[35,36]. Tissue atrophy percentage was calculated by using the
following formula: % tissue atrophy = (total ipsilateral tissue/total
contralateral tissue) × 100 and was performed by an investigator
blinded to treatment.
2.7. Spleen and body weight
Body weight was recorded immediately prior to sacriﬁce. The
spleen was removed after perfusion. The splenic weight at sacriﬁce
was also recorded and normalized to body weight by the following
formula: (splenic weight/body weight) × 100.
2.8. Measurement of serum IL-6
Serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were assessed at sacriﬁce
(after 6 weeks) in the ﬁrst experimental cohort of mice as per
manufacturer’s instructions (Mouse IL-6 ELISA Ready-SET-Go!® ,
eBiosciences Inc, San Diego, CA 92121).
2.9. Whole cell lysis and western blot
Samples were obtained 6 weeks after stroke from the second experimental cohort of mice by rapidly removing the brains,
followed by immediate dissection into the right (R; ischemic)
and left (L; non-ischemic) hemispheres and ﬂash freezing in
2-methylbutane on dry ice and stored at −80 ◦ C if not used immediately. Samples were homogenized with dounce homogenizers
in cold triton lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM
DTT, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and 1:50 protease inhibitor) and
brieﬂy sonicated on ice. Extracts were immediately centrifuged
at 14,000 × g and frozen at −80 ◦ C. Protein concentration was
determined by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc
Inc., Rockford, IL) and subjected to Western Blotting as previously
described [37]. A total of 30 ␮g of protein was loaded in each well
and resolved on 4–15% SDS electrophoresis gels and transferred
to a PVDF (polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane). Total myelin,
arginase-1 and actin were detected by using their speciﬁc antibodies; Myelin Basic Protein (1:1000 Abcam), arginase-1 (1:1000 BD
bioscience) and actin (1:5000, Sigma) respectively. All blots were
blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature
and incubated overnight in primary antibodies at 4 ◦ C in nonfat dry milk. Secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG 1:10,000,
goat anti-mouse IgG 1:10,000) were used to detect these proteins.
Thermo Scientiﬁc Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate was used for signal detection. The densitometry of Western
blotting images (n = 5 per group) was performed with computer
software (Image J).
2.10. Immunohistochemical analysis
A standard procedure was utilized for IHC staining on 30␮m sections (experimental cohort1) mounted on Fischer Scientiﬁc
Superfrost Plus charged slides. Brieﬂy, mounted tissue sections
were thoroughly rinsed in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
After rinsing antigen retrieval was performed by heating the tissue
in a 10 mM sodium citrate buffer at pH 6.2. Tissue sections were

158

R. Verma et al. / Behavioural Brain Research 269 (2014) 155–163

incubated for 1 h in blocking solution (0.3% Triton-X, 5% normal
goat serum in 1× PBS) and then incubated overnight in primary
antibody at 4 ◦ C (arginase-1 1:100; IBA-1 1:100; GFAP-Cy3 1:500).
Following primary antibody incubation, tissue sections were thoroughly rinsed in PBST (0.05% tween 20 in PBS) and were incubated
with the appropriate Alexa-Fluor conjugated secondary antibody
(1:1000, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature except for GFAP treated tissue. After rinsing in PBST, sections
were coverslipped with mounting media (UltraCruzTM Mounting
Medium, Santa Cruz Biotech, USA). Three coronal brain sections
per mouse (n = 4 per group), taken 0.02, 0.45, and 0.98 mm from
bregma, were stained and visualized for quantiﬁcation at 10× magniﬁcation at the core/penumbra junction. To quantify GFAP and
IBA-1, MosaiX software was utilized to obtain a full brain section
image for cell counting. A blinded observer quantiﬁed the arginase1, DAPI, and IBA-1 co-expressing cells using Image J software. The
average numbers of cells visualized from 3 adjacent regions at the
core/penumbra junction were recorded for each mouse.
2.11. Statistics
All data were analyzed and expressed as means ± S.E.M. Measurement of tissue atrophy and other tests with two groups were
analyzed with T test. For the two-factor interaction a two-way
ANOVA was used with (cohort 2) or without (cohort 1) repeated
measures followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test. A probability value
of P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. Investigators performing and analyzing behavioral tests and histological
analyses were blinded to housing conditions.
3. Results
3.1. PH mice show increased sociability
No side preference (right versus left chamber) was found at
baseline or during the habituation period. No signiﬁcant differences in sociability in stroke mice PH with a healthy partner (STcSH)
versus stroke mice PH with a stroke partner (STcST) was seen (Supplementary Fig. 2). Similarly there was no signiﬁcant difference
between sham mice pair housed with a stroke (SHcST) or with
a healthy partner (SHcSH) (Supplementary Fig. 3) Therefore, we
pooled STcSH and STcST groups and referred to the collapsed group
as the ST-PH group in all subsequent analysis. Similarly, SHcST
and SHcSH were also pooled and referred to as the SH-PH group.
A signiﬁcant interaction was found between stroke and housing
condition (F(1,39) = 6.026; P = 0.0187) mice at 6 weeks after stroke
(cohort 1) (Fig. 2a). Moreover, there was a signiﬁcant difference
between ST-ISO and ST-PH mice (P = 0.0185). When the changes in
sociability were followed over time in cohort 2, we found that the
sociability index was unaffected by housing condition early after
stroke (days 7, 14 and 21) but diverged at day 28 (P < 0.05), suggesting transient sociability deﬁcits during the chronic phase in ST-ISO
mice. A two-factor interaction ‘group versus days’ in a repeated
measure two-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests
showed an overall signiﬁcant difference between the PH and SI
groups (F(3,24) = 5.413; P < 0.01) (Fig. 2b). Additionally, a signiﬁcant interaction was found between stroke and housing conditions
in the amount of snifﬁng time between the test and stranger mice
(F(1,21) = 5.884; P < 0.05). There was no main effect of either stroke
or housing condition alone, but ST-ISO mice showed a reduced
interaction (snifﬁng) with stranger mice (Fig. 3) compared to STPH mice. This data suggest that that housing conditions affect social
interaction.

Fig. 2. A signiﬁcant interaction was found between stroke and housing condition
(F(1,39) = 6.026; P = 0.0187) in mice after 6 weeks of stroke (cohort 1). Moreover,
there was a signiﬁcant difference between ISO and PH mice (P = 0.0185) (a). (b) A
two-factor interaction ‘group versus days’ in the repeated measure two-way ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests showed an overall signiﬁcant difference
between the PH and SI groups (F(3,24) = 5.413; P < 0.01).

3.2. Pair housing reverses anhedonic behavior
All stroke animals, regardless of housing condition, showed
reduced consumption of sucrose during the acute phase of injury. In
cohort 1, ST-ISO mice demonstrated an overall reduction in sucrose
consumption as compared to other groups (Supp Fig. 4). There was
no signiﬁcant interaction between stroke and housing condition.
However, there was a signiﬁcant effect of housing (P < 0.05) in consumption of sucrose, which was independent of stroke (Fig. 4a).
No change is water consumption was observed in cohort 1 (Supp
Fig. 5) In cohort 2, both ST-ISO and SH-ISO mice showed a decrease
in sucrose consumption, indicating a depressive-type phenotype
in isolated animals, regardless of injury. ST-PH mice, by contrast,
showed a tendency to recover faster and began drinking earlier
after injury compared to all ISO mice. Similar to cohort 1, all PH mice
in cohort 2 consumed signiﬁcantly more sucrose compared to all
SI mice. A two-factor interaction ‘group versus days” test showed a
signiﬁcant interaction between groups and days (F(18,102) = 1.740;

Fig. 3. A signiﬁcant interaction was found between stroke and housing conditions
during snifﬁng time between test and stranger mice (F(1,21) = 5.884; P < 0.05). However there was no main effect of either stroke or housing condition alone in a two
way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests.

Fig. 4. Effect of sucrose consumption in mice (a) A two way ANOVA with bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons found no signiﬁcant interaction between
housing condition and stroke in sucrose consumption in cohort1 at 6 weeks after
stroke. However, there was a signiﬁcant difference (P < 0.05) between ISO and PH
group independent of stroke in the consumption of sucrose. (b) In repeated testing of sucrose consumption test a two-factor interaction ‘group versus days’ in the
repeated measure two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests showed
a signiﬁcant interaction between groups and days (F(18,102) = 1.740; P < 0.05). The
consumption of sucrose increased progressively in both SI and PH groups.

P < 0.05). The consumption of sucrose increased signiﬁcantly in all
of the groups in a day dependent manner (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4b).

online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2014.04.044.
3.3. Isolation increased immobility in the TST
A highly signiﬁcant interaction (F(1,21) = 13.81; P = 0.0013) was
found between housing conditions and stroke (Fig. 5). ISO mice
demonstrated signiﬁcantly increased immobility duration in the
TST compared to ST-PH mice after 6 weeks suggesting that

159

Fig. 6. (a) Stroke mice paired with healthy partner had signiﬁcantly less cerebral
atrophy (***P < 0.001). (b) Representative coronal section of post stroke ISO and PH
brains stained with Cresyl violet. (For interpretation of the references to color in
ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.)

avolitional effects of the stroke were modiﬁed by housing conditions. Moreover, a signiﬁcant main effect of stroke (P = 0.0233) was
also found. Multiple comparison analysis also revealed that STISO were signiﬁcantly more immobile as compared to the ST-PH
group. Surprisingly, SH-PH showed a highly signiﬁcant (P < 0.01)
increase in immobility duration compared to SH-ISO suggesting an
independent effect of isolation.
3.4. Ventricular atrophy
A signiﬁcant loss in brain tissue resulting in ventricular enlargement was found in ST-ISO mice. ST-PH group had signiﬁcantly
less tissue loss compared to ST ISO mice (7.5 ± 1.51% in PH versus
40.8 ± 1.3% in SI; P < 0.001) (Fig. 6a). Fig. 6b shows a representative
coronal section of stroke mice from both PH and SI group at 6 weeks
after stroke.
3.5. Changes in spleen and body weight
No differences in spleen weight, spleen/body weight ratios, or
body weight between ST-ISO and ST-PH mice after 6 weeks of stroke
(Fig. 7), suggesting that splenic weight is unaffected by housing
condition in the chronic phase.
3.6. IL-6 levels

Fig. 5. Immobility duration was signiﬁcantly decreased in post stroke PH mice compared to ISO mice (*P < 0.05). Interestingly, sham mice pair housed with stroke
partner also showed a signiﬁcant increase in immobility duration (**P < 0.01, twoway ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison test). A signiﬁcant interaction
(F(1,21) = 13.81; P < 0.01) was also found between housing condition and stroke in
two way ANOVA.

Higher levels of the serum inﬂammatory biomarker interleukin6 (IL-6) correlate with poor clinical outcomes in the acute period
after ischemic stroke [38], however, little is known about chronic
post-stroke changes in IL-6 levels in experimental models. Serum
levels of IL-6 in ST-PH mice were lower than those observed in
ST-ISO animals 6 weeks after stroke, but this was not statistically signiﬁcant. A two-way ANOVA test followed by multiple
comparisons after Bonferroni correction did not show any significant interaction (F(1,36) = 0.02826; P = 0.8674) between housing
and stroke. However, there was a signiﬁcant effect of housing

(F(1,36) = 10.31; P = 0.0028) between ISO and PH group on serum
IL-6 independent of stroke (Fig. 8). This suggests that SI leads to a
chronic pro-inﬂammatory state even in the absence of injury.
3.7. Pair housing reduces glial activation and modulates
arginase-1 expression
In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying the apparent
beneﬁcial effects of pair housing, we examined the expression of
GFAP and IBA-1, markers of reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis
respectively, 6 weeks after stroke. We found that the glial scar
(dense GFAP expression) was conﬁned to the striatal region in
the ST-PH group, whereas the glial scar extended into both striatal and cortical regions in ST-ISO mice (Fig. 9). Similarly, the
region of intense IBA-1+ expression by microglial/macrophages was
also conﬁned to the striatal region in stroke PH group (Fig. 10).
Interestingly, the overall expression of arginase-1 in whole brain
lysate was signiﬁcantly higher (F(1,14) = 18.05; P = 0.0008) in the
ST-ISO group compared to other groups (Fig. 11a). However, when
speciﬁc cell types were examined, an increase in the number of

stroke recovery [39]. The negative effects of SI on stroke have
been well documented in clinical populations [40,41]. SI prior to
stroke enhances tissue injury, delays recovery and increases mortality [42,43]. Experimental studies have shown similar ﬁndings.
The detrimental effects of SI are mediated in part by enhanced NFKB activation, IL-6 production, and decreased oxytocin [20,44,45].
The majority of pre-clinical studies examined pre-stroke isolation
which may be less translationally relevant as patients are often not
identiﬁed as isolated until after they come to medical attention for
their stroke. A recent study from our lab has shown that post-stroke
pair housing increases BDNF levels and improves behavioral recovery [27]. However, detailed evaluation of sociability and depressive

Stroke survivors, often because of their limited functional mobility, are at risk for social isolation. Social isolation and reduced social
support are linked to an increased risk of depression and poorer

two way ANOVA test followed by multiple comparisons after bonferroni correction
showed no signiﬁcant difference between ST-PH and ST-ISO group i.e., there was
no stroke effect nor any interaction between housing and stroke (F(1,36) = 0.02826;
P = 0.8674). However there was a signiﬁcant difference (P < 0.05) between ISO and
PH group regardless of stroke i.e., isolation increased IL-6 levels.

section was taken after 6 weeks of stroke. Double immunostaioning of Iba-1 (red)

the site of infarction in both stroke groups (n = 4 per group). Unlike GFAP, Iba-1
expression was not widespread in ipsilateral hemisphere in the ST-ISO group, and
was conﬁned to damaged areas as shown by dotted lines. (For interpretation of the

behavior was not evaluated. Our work here suggests that a progressive deﬁcit in sociability occurs in isolated animals, with increasing
social withdrawal over time, further worsening the opportunity for
functional recovery.
Mice exhibit a rich repertoire of social behaviors. These
behaviors are important for forming bonds, foraging, defending
territories, avoiding predators, and reproducing successfully [46].
Mice have a natural tendency to approach and investigate unfamiliar conspeciﬁcs [30]. Stroke impacts this normal afﬁliative
behavior and may alter the natural tendency to approach unfamiliar conspeciﬁcs [7,47]. We addressed the need for a “sociability”
behavioral test after stroke, as data is currently lacking for mice,
by modifying a pre-existing three-chamber sociability task [30] to
measure post-stroke sociability/afﬁliative behavior over time.
In this study, we found that ST-PH mice maintain social interaction and sociability throughout the experiment unlike ST ISO
mice. Most interestingly, ST ISO mice demonstrated a progressive decline in sociability that started at day 7 and progressed
over the 4 weeks post-stroke, leading to the lowest interaction a
month after injury. In most behavioral paradigms, especially when
assessing motor deﬁcits, stroke recovery begins within days after
stroke [48], even after large insults. We have previously found
persistent deﬁcits in tasks of sensory-motor integration (i.e., on
the “corner” test) for 6 weeks after injury in prior studies [49]
but this is the ﬁrst description of a behavior that progressively
worsens over time despite recovery in other tasks. Post-stroke
isolation was therefore associated with alterations in at least 3
major behaviors associated with a depression phenotype: sociability, avolition and anhedonia. Improvements in sociability were
seen with pair-housing. This suggests that there is a great deal
of opportunity in the sub-acute post-stroke period to enhance
neuroplasticity and repair by environmental manipulations. Environmental enrichment refers to housing conditions that facilitate
enhanced sensory, social, cognitive stimulation, and motor activity [50], simple changes in the post-stroke environment led to
enhanced sociability and interaction which improved outcomes.

Moreover, these non-invasive strategies can be employed to
enhance recovery in stroke patients. This is the ﬁrst application of
the three-chamber sociability task to study post-stroke afﬁliative
behavior in transient focal cerebral ischemia. Our ﬁndings demonstrate this paradigm’s applicability for quantifying sociability after
stroke.
In addition to the effect of isolation or pair housing, the location
of a lesion has also been shown to contribute to social behaviors,
with injury to the frontal lobes and right hemisphere in particular being associated with behavioral deﬁcits [51]. The observed
impairment in sociability may be secondary to the severe tissue loss
of prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal junction, cingulate cortex,
insula, and amygdala, as well as their connecting pathways [52,53]
observed in our post-stroke SI cohorts. Moreover, the delay in cortical reorganization as suggested in previous studies may contribute
to impairment and adoption of compensatory behavior, which in
turn can lead to a delay in the recovery of brain function [54,55].
A recent study suggests that social interaction in mice requires the
coordinated activity of oxytocin and 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens core (NAC) and demonstrated that oxytocin acts as a social
reinforcement signal and induces synaptic plasticity which further
requires activation of nucleus accumbens 5-HT1B receptors [56].
Alterations in sociability also led to reduced myelin thickness in the
medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in a model of juvenile isolation.
The reduced thickness of myelin reduces the conduction velocity of myelinated mPFC axons, leading to abnormal information
processing, which in turn may contribute to aberrant social behaviors and working memory [57]. Loss of myelin also contributes to
delayed behavioral recovery in mice after chronic social isolation
in a test of score approach-avoidance behaviors toward an unfamiliar social target [58]. However such robust changes in overall
expression of myelin basic protein (Supp Fig. 6) were not seen in
this study except in the ST ISO group. This could have been due to
the higher degree of tissue loss in isolated mice.

Depression is one of the most prominent psychological changes
associated with stroke [59]. The mechanisms underlying post
stroke depression are not well understood and research on this
topic has been hindered by a lack of reliable chronic animal models of depression after stroke. The data from the current study and
also from previous work [15] suggest that it is possible to induce
and study anhedonia as an index of post-stroke depressive-like
behavior in mice. We observed that sucrose consumption significantly decreased for all groups following surgery (Supp. Fig. 4).
Furthermore, ISO mice showed a signiﬁcantly lower consumption of sucrose than PH mice. This anhedonic characteristic of the
depressive phenotype has also been reported in other models of
social isolation [60]. Interestingly, the healthy non-stroke partners
of stroke mice also showed a depressive phenotype as assessed by
immobility in the TST. This may be similar to what is seen in clinical
populations, where caregivers that spend the majority of their time
with dependent patients at home also are at high risk for depression
[61].
Similar to what was seen in the SCT and TST, PH improves afﬁliative behavior in the three-chamber sociability test. Taken together
this data suggests that the reduced sociability phenotype is an
additive effect of isolation and stroke. Although, it can be argued
that the increased behavioral deﬁcits seen in post stroke SI mice
are simply an epiphenomenon of changes in infarct size, however
this is unlikely based on the progressive nature of the sociability
deﬁcit in this group [62]. Therefore, our data showed that stroke
and social isolation independently and synergistically contributed
to a depression phenotype.
Stroke is also associated with dysregulation of the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and neuroinﬂammation. Both of these physiological alterations have been associated
with depressive symptoms in non-stroke populations [63–65]. The
association between depression, depressive symptoms and elevated levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, including interleukin
(IL)-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP), has been well described in
both clinical and preclinical models of psychosocial stress [19,66].
We found no signiﬁcant changes in circulating IL-6 levels 6 weeks
after stroke in PH versus SI mice. However, SI mice from both sham
and stroke groups had a signiﬁcant increase in serum IL-6 levels
compared to PH mice. This suggests that chronic isolation leads
to a baseline “pro-inﬂammatory state” which may contribute to
enhanced damage when an injury does occur. This is consistent
with previous reports where isolation itself leads to increases in
serum IL-6 levels in men [66] and may be part of the mechanism
by which pre-stroke social isolation enhances disease. In contrast
to our results, several previous studies [20] have found increased
levels of serum IL-6 in isolated mice. However the levels were
obtained at short time points after injury (12–72 h after stroke). It
is likely that these elevations in IL-6 are transient and seen only
in the acute phase. It appears that IL-6 levels return to baseline as
stroke-induced inﬂammation wanes, similar to what we observed
with stroke-induced changes in splenic volume [67].
Microglia/macrophages represent the ﬁrst line of defense
against CNS and ischemic brain injury [68,69]. The resident
microglia and peripheral macrophages are rapidly mobilized to
the site of injury where they initiate dual but opposing responses.
Others have found that there is an intial anti-inﬂammatory M2
response during early reperfusion, but the pro-inﬂammatory M1
phenotype rapidly emerges and dominates the myeloid response,
but these responses were only evaluated for 2 weeks after injury
[69]. In this study we examined arginase-1, a marker for M2 activation 6 weeks after stroke. Unexpectedly, total brain arginase-1
expression was higher in isolated stroke mice. This ﬁnding however
is consistent with a recent study reporting increased expression of arginase-1 after stroke, postulated to be be involved in
secondary expansion of ischemic damage by increasing reactive

oxygen species [70,71]. The higher level of arginase-1 in SI mice was
surprising as arginase-1 is a well characterized marker of the M2
myeloid phenotype, considered to be reparative subset of myeloid
cells [72]. To further explore this ﬁnding, we examined the expression of arginase-1 speciﬁcally in Iba-1+ cells. Higher numbers of
arginase-1 and Iba-1+ co-expressing cells were seen in post-stroke
PH mice compared to SI mice and the intensity of arginase-1 expression was higher in these cells. This suggests that the M2 phenotype
of microglia/macrophages dominates during the recovery phase
in ST-PH as compared to ST-ISO mice. The paradoxical ﬁndings in
the expression of arginase-1 in our western blot, which examined
whole cell lysates (which includes all cell types) versus our ﬁndings
from subsequent IHC experiments suggest that arginase-1 might
have cell speciﬁc effects [71,73,74].
Overall, our ﬁndings suggest that (1) PH hastens recovery and
reduces histological damage after stroke, (2) SI and stroke can
either independently or additively alter at least 3 major aspects
of the depressive phenotype: sociability, avolition and anhedonia,
(3) progressive withdrawal in isolated animals may further hinder recovery, (4) the three chamber socialization task can be an
appropriate model to study long term behavior changes, and (5)
the protective effects of PH may be mediated by M2 activation
in microglia/macrophages. These studies may help translate targeted social interventions to reduces PSD and enhance recovery
after stroke.
