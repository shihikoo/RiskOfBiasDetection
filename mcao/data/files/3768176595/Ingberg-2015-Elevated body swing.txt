Abstract 
Background:  The elevated body swing test (EBST) is a behavioral test used to evaluate experimental stroke in
rodents. The basic idea is that when the animal is suspended vertically by the tail, it will swing its head laterally to the
left or right depending on lesion side. In a previous study from our lab using the EBST after middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo), rats swung contralateral to the infarct day 1 post-MCAo, but ipsilateral day 3 post-MCAo. This shift
was unexpected and prompted us to perform the present study. First, the literature was systematically reviewed to
elucidate whether a similar shift had been noticed before, and if consensus existed regarding swing direction. Secondly, an experiment was conducted to systematically investigate the suggested behavior. Eighty-three adult male
and female Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to MCAo or sham surgery and the EBST was performed up to 7 days
after the lesion.
Results:  Both experimentally and through systematic literature review, the present study shows that the direction
of biased swing activity in the EBST for rodents after cerebral ischemia can differ and even shift over time in some
situations. The EBST curve for females was significantly different from that of males after the same occlusion time
(p = 0.023).
Conclusions:  This study highlights the importance of adequate reporting of behavioral tests for lateralization and it
is concluded that the EBST cannot be recommended as a test for motor asymmetry after MCAo in rats.

Background
Stroke is one of the most devastating diseases in terms of
mortality and disability [1]. In addition to the effects on
patients and relatives, it imposes a substantial economic
burden on the society [1]. Despite major research efforts
providing improved understanding of stroke mechanisms
the available treatment options are still few [2]. Preclinical stroke studies are mainly performed in rodents subjected to ischemic stroke, most commonly by middle

cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). The outcome measure, for example to evaluate the effect of a drug, has traditionally been infarct size but it is nowadays common to
also include behavioral testing as an endpoint. Numerous such tests have been developed with the intention
of examining how the stroke-induced animal is affected
regarding sensory, motor or cognitive function or the
emotional status [3].
Among the tests used for evaluation of motor functions is the elevated body swing test (EBST). Although a
similar procedure was described as early as 1979 [4], the
test in its current form was developed 1995 by Borlongan
and Sanberg as a test for asymmetrical motor behavior
in an animal model of Parkinson’s disease [5]. Soon after
this, the EBST was employed by the same research group

also in animal studies of Huntington’s disease [6] and
ischemic stroke [7]. The basic idea is that when the animal is lifted by the tail and held vertically, it will swing its
head to the left or to the right. Whereas healthy animals
on a group level are likely to swing approximately 50% to
either side, animals with a unilateral cerebral lesion, e.g.
ischemic stroke, should present with a dominant/biased
swing direction. The extent of such biased swing activity,
for example overweight of swings to the rats’ right side,
is suggested to be a measure of lateralization of motor
behavior. The first stroke study using EBST described
swings favoring the side ipsilateral to the lesion, and the
test has subsequently been used to evaluate lesions in a
number of preclinical ischemic stroke studies with rats
[7–32], mice [33–35] and gerbils [36–38], as well as to
confirm successful surgery for inclusion [39] (results
from all these studies are presented herein). The two
widely used neurological scoring exams for MCAo studies designed by Bederson [40] and Garcia [41], are also
somewhat related to the EBST; both of these include
a step where the rat is held by the tail and symmetry of
motor behavior is assessed.
In a previous study from our lab [42], one of the outcomes was the EBST (performed 1 and 3  days after
MCAo), and an interesting phenomenon was observed.
During testing day 1 post-MCAo, the rats in two out of
three stroke groups swung predominantly to the side
contralateral to the ischemic hemisphere (from here on,
contralateral or ipsilateral refer to direction of swings in
relation to the ischemic hemisphere), but had day 3 postMCAo developed an ipsilateral side bias (Fig.  1). This
shift was highly unexpected, and encouraged us to further investigate the phenomenon. Hence, we performed

the current study consisting of two steps: first, the literature was systematically searched for studies using the
EBST after ischemic stroke in rodents to elucidate if the
shift that we observed had been noticed before, and if
consensus existed regarding swing direction. Secondly,
an experiment was conducted to systematically investigate the suggested shifting behavior in the EBST and
further how robust the phenomenon was to alterations
in methodology, both regarding sex of the animals and
infarct size (occlusion time).

Methods
Systematic review

In addition to our abovementioned study (Fig.  1; [42]),
the Medline database was searched through PubMed for
papers with the EBST using the search string (stroke or
“cerebral ischemia”) and (“elevated body swing” or EBST
or “tail suspension”). Papers published up until June 2014
were reviewed (n  =  36). An article was included if the
following criteria were met:
1.	 Article written in English.
2.	Rodents were subjected to unilateral cerebral
ischemia.
3.	 At some point after the induced ischemia, the animals were suspended by their tails and the directions
of the head and body movements were recorded.
Subsequently, in the included papers retrieved by the
Medline search (n  =  22), the descriptions of the EBST
in the methods sections were searched for references.
If criteria were met in these referred articles, they were
also included (n  =  10). From all the included papers
(n  =  33; Fig.  2), information regarding whether the
stroked animals in the studies swung mainly towards
the side contralateral or ipsilateral to the ischemic hemisphere, or if there was no biased swing activity, was
extracted. If no statistical comparison had been performed, an explicit statement that the swing activity was
biased towards the contralateral or the ipsilateral side
was accepted. In cases where no information was provided regarding direction of the biased swing activity,
the swing direction was labeled as “unclear”. One group
showing biased swing activity was considered enough to
label the paper as either contralateral, ipsilateral, unclear
or with a shift over time, even though other groups in
the same study might have presented without a side
preference. Each paper was also scanned for indications
of a shift of main swing directions, similar to what was
previously observed in our lab (see “Background” and
[42]). If a shift was found, the paper was categorized into
“shift over time”.

University.
Grouping

The rats were randomly allocated into six groups: Four
MCAo groups (Male 30  min, n  =  13; Male 60  min,
n = 20; Male 90 min, n = 18; Female 60 min, n = 13) and
two sham groups (Male sham ICA, n  =  9; Male sham
CCA + ECA, n = 10). See Fig. 3 for an overview of the
experiment. Animals of both sexes, as well as different
occlusion times were included to enable a broader investigation of EBST behavior.

From the original Medline search and through reviewing the articles
retrieved, together with the previous article from our lab [42], there
were 33 articles. These were further analyzed with regard to main
swing direction in the EBST after unilateral cerebral ischemia.

For ovariectomy, MCAo and sham surgery, the animals
were anesthetized with isoflurane (Forene®, Abbott Scandinavia AB, Solna, Sweden), 4.5% for induction and 1.5%
for maintenance, delivered in a 30/70 mixture of O2/N2O.
Body temperature was maintained at 37°C using a homeothermic blanket connected to a rectal probe (50-7061,
Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Ophtalmic
ointment (Lubrithal, VetXX, Uldum, Denmark) was provided for eye protection. For pain relief, 5  mg/kg bodyweight of carpofen (462986, Rimadyl Vet, Pfizer ApS,
Ballerup, Denmark) was administered during ovariectomy (only the females were thus subjected to this treatment, but a washout period of 14  days followed before
MCAo). Before MCAo and sham surgery, 1.25  mg/
kg bodyweight of bupivacaine (Marcain, AstraZeneca,
Södertälje, Sweden) was administered. Fluid replenishment with 5 mL saline was given in connection with the
MCAo and sham surgery. The skin was cleaned with
Iodine solution (Jodopax vet®; Pharmaxim AB, Helsingborg, Sweden) before incisions.
14 days prior to MCAo, the female rats (group Female
60 min) were ovariectomized via the dorsal route [43].
The groups Male 30  min, Male 60  min, Male 90  min
and Female 60  min were subjected to transient cerebral

ischemia in the left hemisphere induced by the filament
method, based on the procedure originally described
by Koizumi [44] and Longa [45]. With the rat in supine
position, a 2 cm cervical midline incision was made and
the common (CCA), internal (ICA) and external (ECA)
carotid arteries were freed from surrounding tissue. CCA
and ECA were ligated with a suture (6-0 silk suture, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA), while ICA
was temporarily clipped with a vascular microclip (8 mm
artery clip, Rebstock Instruments Gmbh, Dürbheim,
Germany). Thereafter, an incision was made in the CCA
and a 30  mm silicone coated 4-0 nylon suture (403756,
Doccol, Redlands, CA, USA) was inserted and advanced
up ICA approximately 18–20 mm until a mild resistance
was felt, indicating correct placement. The filament was
secured by a knot and the animal was allowed to wake up
from anesthesia. After 30 (Male 30 min), 60 (Male 60 min
and Female 60  min) or 90 (Male 90  min) minutes of
occlusion, during which time the rat was kept in a heated
cage (25°C), it was re-anesthetized to enable filament
withdrawal, permanent occlusion of ICA and proper closure of the incision. The rats were allowed to recover in
heated cages (25°C) for 1 h, and during the first 24 h postoperatively, they were provided water-soaked food pellets
in a petri dish on the cage floor to encourage eating. The
rats in the sham groups (Male sham ICA and Male sham
CCA + ECA) were subjected to the same procedure, with
some exceptions. For group Male sham CCA  +  ECA
both CCA and ECA vessels were ligated but no incision
was made in CCA and hence no filament was inserted.
For group Male sham ICA, only ICA was ligated, no incision was made and no filament was inserted.
Elevated body swing test

Although EBST is the most common term used to
describe the test discussed herein, it has also been called
“the tail suspension test” [46]. However, this denomination usually refers to a similar test used for screening
antidepressants in mice, in which the degree of immobility is observed rather than the direction of the swings. Yet
other names, “C-shaped lateral bending of body” [32] and
“hang-tail test” [47], have been used for similar tests.
Before MCAo and on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 (Fig.  3) the
EBST was performed for all animals based on the original description by Borlongan et al. [5] with some minor
modifications. The rat was put in a transparent cage
(36  ×  19.5  ×  18.5  cm) and allowed to attain a neutral
position, with all four paws on the ground. By the base
of the tail, it was then elevated to approximately 10  cm
from the bottom of the cage and the direction of the first
body swing, i.e. a >10° bending of the upper body out of
the vertical axis to either side, was recorded. Before the
next swing, the animal was placed back in the cage to

Page 4 of 11

reposition. Once it was visibly balanced and not displaying a preference for one side, it was re-suspended. The
procedure was repeated 20 times. If the animal did not
commence swing behavior, the base of the tail was gently
pressed in order to induce this. The examiner alternated
the hand used to pick up the rat and the position relative
to the testing cage to avoid influencing the direction of
swings, and the test was carried without any disturbing
objects in the immediate surroundings. The proportion
of right-side swings were calculated. For baseline values
and testing on day 1 the EBST was performed only once
per animal, while days 2, 3 and 7 had two testing sessions
where the animals were allowed to rest for approximately
30 min in between.
To be able to statistically test the shifting behavior, the
following definition was used:
1.	Pre-MCAo (baseline), the proportion of right-side
swings must not be significantly different from 0.5.
2.	 On day 1, the proportion of right-side swings should
be significantly higher than baseline.
3.	 On day 2, 3 and 7 the side preference should shift and
hence the proportion of right-side swings should be
significantly lower than baseline and remain there.
Infarct measurement

Under anesthesia (see “Surgical procedures” above) the
rat was decapitated using a rodent guillotine. The brain
was dissected out, cooled in ice water for 5 min and subsequently sliced in 2  mm slices using a rat brain matrix
(RBM-4000, ASI Instrument Inc., USA). The slices were
then soaked for 15  min in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium hydrochloride solution (TTC; Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB, CAS# 298-96-4, Stockholm, Sweden) at 37°C
and scanned (ScanJet 2c, Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto,
CA, USA). Infarcts were measured in a similar way as
described by Goldlust et al. (8784144), with an automatic
40% green spectrum threshold (SigmaScan Pro 5, Systat
Software Inc, San Jose, CA, USA). Total infarct volume
was calculated indirectly according to Swanson et al. [48]:
Corrected infarct volume  =  [contralateral hemisphere  −  [ipsilateral hemisphere  −  crude infarct]]/contralateral hemisphere.
The indirect method (calculation based on remaining
viable tissue in the lesioned hemisphere) was chosen to
minimize error introduced by loss of brain tissue due to
the infarction 7  days after MCAo. Direct measurement
of infarct size (pixels) was used to calculate proportion of
infarct in cortex and striatum, respectively.
Statistics

Based on the definition of the shift (see above), occurrence of shifting behavior in all groups subjected to

Ingberg et al. BMC Neurosci (2015) 16:50

MCAo was statistically tested by repeated measures
ANOVA with post hoc testing against baseline, Bonferroni corrected. The same method was used for analysis
after regrouping of males according to infarct size. For
group Male small infarcts Greenhouse–Geisser correction was used due to violation of sphericity (tested with
Mauchly’s sphericity test). One-sample t tests were used
to test if the proportion of right-side swings in the groups
at baseline (before MCAo) differed from 0.5.
Comparisons of EBST results (proportion of right-side
swings) between the groups Male 60  min and Female
60 min, and between the male groups (Male 30 min, Male
60 min and Male 90 min) were made by two-way mixed
ANOVA with day as within-subjects variable and group
as between-subjects variable. Because of unequal variances (Levene’s test) in both analyses, data were square
root transformed. After square root transformation, Levene’s test was performed again and did not show unequal
variances.
One-way independent ANOVA was used to compare
infarct volumes in the MCAo groups (Female 60  min,
Male 30 min, Male 60 min and Male 90 min). Data was
square root transformed because of unequal variances
(Levene’s test). After transformation, Levene’s test was
performed again and showed no unequal variances.
For comparison of the proportion of infarcts in cortex
between the MCAo groups (Female 60 min, Male 30 min,
Male 60  min and Male 90  min), the non-parametric
equivalent to one-way independent ANOVA Kruskal–
Wallis test was used since variances were unequal
(Levene’s test) both before and after square root transformation. Homogeneity of variance for the Kruskal–Wallis
test was confirmed by one-way independent ANOVA for
the absolute difference between ranks and mean ranks of
the groups.
To compare the shifting animals with the non-shifting
regarding infarct volume and location of infarct (proportion of infarct in cortex), two two-way ANCOVA models
were performed. To control for sex and occlusion time,
these variables were included as a fixed categorical factor
and a continuous covariate, respectively.
Data are presented as mean  ±  SEM throughout the
article.
Protocol violations

The overall mortality of the study was 29% (24/83,
Table  1). All animals that died spontaneously prior to
sacrifice on day 7 were excluded from the analyses.
Animals that did not have any visible infarcts with
direct measurement (for calculation of proportion of
infarct in cortex and striatum, respectively) but still had
a positive value for total infarct volume which was calculated with another approach (indirectly according to

analyses of cortex/striatum ratio and differences in proportion of infarcts in cortex. With indirect infarct measurement it is possible to obtain negative values and, as
mentioned above, this method was used for calculation
of total infarct volume. In 13 animals with very small
infarcts, negative values were set to 0 in the analysis.
Actual group sizes after exclusion of animals that
died was n  =  10 for all the MCAo groups, and n  =  9
and n  =  10 for the Male sham ICA and Male sham
CCA + ECA groups, respectively. For analyses of cortex/
striatum ratio and differences in proportion of infarcts in
cortex, however, group sizes were Female 60 min (n = 9),
Male 30  min (n  =  10), Male 60  min (n  =  10), Male
90 min (n = 9), Male sham ICA (n = 8) and Male sham
CCA + ECA (n = 5) since some animals were excluded
as described in the preceding paragraph.

Results
Systematic review

Although swing activity to the side contralateral to the
ischemic hemisphere dominated, a few articles reported
ipsilateral swings (14/33 and 3/33 respectively, Table  2).
Almost half of the studies (14/33, Table  2) were labeled
unclear, i.e. a biased swing activity was described but
not whether it was ipsilateral or contralateral. The use
of females exclusively was reported in only two of the
included papers, hence no comparisons regarding sex
differences could be performed. One study, except from
our previous, reported a shift in direction over time
(Table 2). All studies had at least one group with biased
swing activity.
Elevated body swing test

Of all the groups, only Sham ICA had baseline values for
proportion of right-side swings that differed significantly
from 0.5 [t(8) = −2,69; p = 0.028].
When occurrence of shifting behavior was tested
according to the definition (see “Methods”), a main
effect of time on proportion of right-side swings was

ICA [F(4, 32)  =  0.22; p  >  0.05] and sham CCA  +  ECA
[F(4, 32) = 0.93; p > 0.05]. Post-hoc testing against baseline revealed for group Female 60 significantly lower values on days 2 (p = 0.008), 3 (p = 0.04) and 7 (p = 0.04)
(Fig.  4a). Group Male 30  min had increased proportion of right-side swings compared to baseline on day 1
(p = 0.004), and group Male 90 min on day 1 (p = 0.02)
and day 7 (p = 0.008) (Fig. 4c).
Because of high variability in infarct sizes, an additional analysis of the male rats were done after regrouping according to infarct size (Male small infarcts, Male
medium infarcts and Male large infarcts; n = 10; Fig. 5).
These groups were, similar to what was described for
the original groups above, tested regarding proportion of right-side swings according the definition of
shifting behavior. A main effect of time was found for
groups Male small infarcts [F(2, 16)  =  3,70; p  =  0.048]
and Male large infarcts [F(4, 36)  =  4,92; p  =  0.003] but
not for group Male medium infarcts [F(4, 36)  =  0.73;
p  >  0.05]. Post-hoc testing against baseline showed significantly higher proportion of right-side swings on day 1
for groups Male small infarcts (p = 0.008) and Male large
infarcts (p = 0.004).
The female 60 min group differed significantly from the
Male 60  min group regarding proportion of right-side
swings over time [F(1, 18) = 6.17; p = 0.023] while no significances were found when the three male groups were
compared in the same way [F(2, 27) = 1.62; p > 0.05].
Even though no significant shifting behavior was seen
on a group level, a separate graph was constructed to
illustrate that the phenomenon existed among several
individuals. From MCAo groups (Male 30  min, Male
60  min, Male 90  min and Female 60  min), individual
rats with proportion of right-side swings >0.8 on day 1
and <0.4 on days 2 or 3 were plotted (Fig.  6). With this

approach, 12/40 rats (30%) of the rats met the criteria (3
from Male 30 min, 5 from male 60 min, one from Male
90  min and 3 from Female 60  min). As comparison,
when the criteria were inverted (proportion of right-side
swings <0.2 on day 1 and >0.6 on days 2 or 3), only one
rat was included.
Infarct volume

No significant differences in infarct volume [F(3,
36)  =  1.46; p  >  0.05] or location of infarct (proportion
of infarct in cortex; Kruskal–Wallis test; p > 0.541) were
seen between the groups that underwent MCAo.
In the analysis of the shifting animals in Fig.  6 versus
the non-shifting animals, no significant effect of shift
was seen on infarct volume [F(1, 35) = 0.01; p > 0.05] or
location of infarct [proportion of infarct in cortex; F(1,
31) = 0.92; p > 0.05].

Discussion
The systematic review revealed that different articles
reported diametrically different swing directions in the
EBST after unilateral cerebral ischemia, emphasizing
the confusion that exists regarding this test. When the
shifting behavior, suggested in the preceding study from
our lab [42], was statistically tested according the definition presented in “Methods”, no significant change in
direction was seen in any of the groups. However, the
side preference profile of the group designed based on
the previous study [42] (Female 60  min) still is interesting; a persistent ipsilateral side preference developed
but not until day 2. Since rats subjected to MCAo usually are most affected early after stroke, the biggest
impact on behavior would have been expected on day

must obviously be interpreted with great caution), shows
that although not strong enough to have any major influence on the group curves, a clear shift in swing direction
existed among almost a third of the rats. However, this

shift was not persistent; on day 7 the proportion of rightside swings varies greatly among the rats. One article in
the systematic review also reported a change in direction. After right-sided cerebral ischemia in gerbils, the
animals displayed right-biased swings (ipsilateral) on the
day of ischemia that switched to left-biased swings (contralateral) at 2  days post-ischemia [36]. Thus, the shift
had a similar temporal pattern to the one we described

but strangely enough it went in the opposite direction,
from ipsilateral to contralateral rather than the other
way around. Another study from the systematic review
did mention the fact that direction of swings when performing the EBST can differ, and location of ischemia
was here proposed as the explanatory factor; striatal
damage would result in ipsilateral swings whereas cortical or combined damage would make the animals swing

contralaterally [14]. Based on this, the group Female
60  min (that displayed partial ipsilateral swing tendency) in the current study would have been expected
to have a smaller proportion of infarct in cortex. However, we did not find any significant differences between
the groups regarding infarct location (proportion of
infarct in cortex) or infarct volume. Nor were there any
significant differences in the explorative comparison of
animals with a shift (Fig.  6) versus non-shifting animals
for these two outcomes, further challenging location of
infarct as the crucial factor determining swing direction.
Because of large variability in infarct sizes in the present
study, the male MCAo rats were regrouped according to

lesion volume in an additional analysis (Fig.  5). It could
be argued that such an approach is more relevant than
occlusion time since this reflects the actual sizes of the
lesions produced rather than the intentions. No shifting
behavior according to the definition was found in these
groups either, and no obvious pattern regarding infarct
size and swing direction was found. Both the group with
the smallest infarcts (Male small infarcts) and the group
with the largest infarcts (Male large infarcts) had significantly higher proportion of right-side swings compared
to baseline on day 1, while the rats with middle-sized
infarcts (Male medium infarcts) had no significant differences compared to baseline on any of the post-MCAo
days. TTC staining 1 week after the MCAo was used in
the current study. Although this has been done before
[49, 50], concerns have been raised regarding the use this
method at such a late point in time [51].
ECA supplies tissues around the face of the rat and
ligation can cause ischemia in this region [52]. Since two
different sham groups were used in the current study, one
in which we ligated CCA and ECA during the ischemia
induction procedure and one with only ICA ligated, we
were able to investigate whether the facial ischemia, by
affecting EBST behavior, could have anything to do with
the observed shift. For example it could have been that
rats with facial ischemia were more prone to swing in the
opposite direction (contralateral) early after stroke and
that this effect decreased over time resulting in a change
in preferred swing direction (neutral or ipsilateral). However, although the curves of the two sham groups in
Fig.  4e are somewhat different, the proportion of rightside swings did not change distinctly before versus after
surgery in either group and therefore the swing phenomenon seen in the MCAo rats is unlikely to be explained by
a mechanism related to ECA ligation and facial ischemia.
In the clinic, a process somewhat similar to a shift can
sometimes occur after a stroke. Initially, patients typically suffer from flaccid paralysis which in some patients
can develop into spasticity after a few weeks [53]. However, this mechanism is an unlikely explanation for several reasons. First, our shift occurs over days rather than
weeks. Secondly, spasticity primarily affects limbs [53],
while the current phenomenon seems related to axial
muscles. And finally, a transition from flaccid paralysis to
spasticity should in theory produce a change from ipsilateral to contralateral swings, i.e. the opposite to what we
observed, since ischemia affects the part of the body contralateral to the infarcted hemisphere.
To summarize the discussion regarding possible mechanisms behind a shift, three suggestions were presented:
location of infarct, ischemia in the ECA territory and
spasticity. No support was found in this study for the former two, and the latter seems theoretically unlikely.

Ingberg et al. BMC Neurosci (2015) 16:50

The most striking result of the experimental part is that
the EBST curve for the female rats is noticeably different
from the male groups, even when sex is the only differentiating factor (groups Female 60 min versus Male 60 min;
Fig. 4). Also, when compared against group baseline values for proportion of right-side swings, the female group
(Female 60 min) presented with significantly lower values
on all timepoints except the first, while the two of the
male groups, Male 30 min and Male 90 min, on the contrary had values significantly higher than baseline on one
and two timepoints, respectively. The fact that we earlier
obtained similar results with females [42], corroborates
the notion of an effect of sex on EBST performance. The
fact that the females are ovariectomized makes estrogens less likely as an explanation for this. Differences in
other hormones such as testosterone, or in brain wiring
between female and male rats could perhaps contribute,
but these suggestions are merely speculations. Unfortunately, only two studies [24, 42] from the systematic
review reported the use of females exclusively and therefore it is hard to draw any conclusions from this. However, it is worth mentioning that one of these two studies,
the one not performed our lab, had contralateral swings
[24], contradicting the abovementioned idea of a sex
effect.
Strengths and weaknesses

A drawback of this study is the mortality, which was
higher than what we have seen previously in our lab.
Perhaps this was a consequence of intense EBST testing;
even though the procedure is not long in duration it is
probably stressful for the animal to repeatedly be suspended upside-down. To try to reduce the stress imposed
on the rats early after stroke, only one testing session was
performed on day 1, whereas the rats were tested twice
on days 2, 3 and 7. Cerebral blood flow measurement to
ensure successful filament insertion and occlusion was
not used which might have decreased the success rate of
the ischemia inductions.
A strength is that we included several groups that differed in terms of sex and occlusion time. This made it
possible to show how the EBST performance can change
with altered conditions. The inclusion of a thorough systematic review of the existing literature on the subject
also adds weight to the study.

Conclusions
The present study shows, both experimentally and
through systematic literature review, that the direction of
biased swing activity in the EBST for rodents after cerebral
ischemia can differ and even shift over time in some situations. Although it does not provide an explanation to why
this is the case, it highlights the importance of clear and

Page 9 of 11

adequate reporting of behavioral tests for lateralization.
Since we could not find a swing profile consistent among
all groups, not even if only the first day post-MCAo (day
1) was considered, we cannot recommend the use of this
test for motor asymmetry after MCAo in rats.
