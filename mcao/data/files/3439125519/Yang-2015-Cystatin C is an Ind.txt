Abstract Cystatin C (CysC) has been used as a renal
function indicator and a strong predictor of cardiovascular
events. In this study, we determined the prognostic value of
serum CysC in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS)
and examined its protective role on ischemic brain injury.
First-ever stroke patients (601 cases) and control subjects
(325 cases) were recruited. Serum CysC level in patients
with AIS were significantly higher than that in controls.
Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that
elevated CysC is an independent risk factor of AIS; the
odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) was 9.80
(3.12–30.83). The integrated population was divided into
quintiles according to serum CysC. Compared with the first
quintile, the odds ratios of risk for AIS in fourth quintile
and fifth quintile were 1.92 (1.08–3.40) and 2.88
(1.49–5.54), respectively. Serum CysC was not associated
with neurological deficits and the location of ischemic area;
however, serum CysC in patients decreased after one-week
therapy. This was consistent with CysC expression after

ischemia/reperfusion injury in a mouse focal ischemia/
reperfusion injury model. Exogenous CysC exerted neuroprotective effects by reducing infarct volume in this
animal stroke model. Therefore, serum CysC is highly
associated with AIS and is an independent prediction
marker for AIS. Since our findings demonstrated the protection of exogenous CysC on ischemic brain injury, CysC
is a novel and promising therapeutic target for AIS.

Introduction
Cystatin C (CysC) is a 120 amino-acid protein produced by
all nucleated cells in the human body. Since CysC is freely
filtered by glomerulus and metabolized by proximal tubule,
CysC has been used as a more sensitive renal function
indicator than conventional renal markers such as creatinine (Dharnidharka et al. 2002). In addition, CysC, as one
of the most important inhibitors of cysteine proteases like
Cathepsin B, plays an important role in the regulation of
cell death and survival and is highly associated with many
diseases (Gauthier et al. 2011). Recent increasing evidences indicate that high serum CysC concentration is
closely associated with cardiovascular events including
heart failure and coronary artery disease and is regarded as
a strong predictor of cardiovascular events (Angelidis et al.
2013). Due to highly abundant expression of CysC in different brain tissues and cell types (Hakansson et al. 1996),
the role of CysC in the central nervous system receives
more attentions. CysC levels in the cerebral spinal fluid
significantly decrease in patients with Alzheimer’s disease
(Hansson et al. 2009); increasing evidence indicates that

123

2

CysC reduces Amyloid b (Ab) plaque formation by binding Ab and decreasing Ab oligomerization and fibril formation(Kaur and Levy 2012). Enhanced CysC expression
is also shown in a 6-hydroxydopamine-induced Parkinson’s disease model, while CysC rescued nigral dopaminergic neurons (Xu et al. 2005). Recent studies also show
the association of CysC with stroke (Palm et al. 1995;
Ishimaru et al. 1996; Pirttila and Pitkanen 2006; Ni et al.
2007; Xiao et al. 2012). The CysC level in hippocampus
increases after ischemic injury in different animal models
(Palm et al. 1995; Ishimaru et al. 1996; Pirttila and Pitkanen 2006). High serum CysC is found in stroke patients and
is associated with larger infarct size and hemorrhage volume (Ni et al. 2007; Xiao et al. 2012). However, the correlation analysis between serum CysC and the risk of acute
ischemic stroke (AIS) has not been well understood. In this
study, we confirmed that CysC is an independent risk
marker of AIS in a large sample population, and we examine its protective role in ischemic brain injury.

Materials and Methods
Ethical Statements
All human and animal studies have been approved by the
Research Ethics Committee of Soochow University/the
University Committee on Animal Care of Soochow
University and have therefore been performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964
Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. All
persons gave their informed consent prior to their inclusion
in the study.
Subjects
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Soochow University. 601 patients with first-ever AIS and
325 control subjects were recruited in this study and provided informed consent to participate. We collected the
clinical data of all inpatients with AIS in the Department of
Neurology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow
University from November 2012 through December 2014.
These selected patients were admitted within 3 days after
onset of stroke symptoms and were confirmed with diffusion-weighted image sequence of magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). Control subjects were collected from inpatients without cerebral infarction during the same period.
The exclusion criteria were any other types of stroke,
severe organic diseases in the brain, serious systemic diseases such as cardiovascular, urinary, and endocrine diseases (except diabetes mellitus), cancer, trauma, infectious
and hematological disorders.

Laboratory and Clinical Information
The first blood collection was on the morning (between
6:00 and 7:00) of the second day after admission with an
overnight fast. The second blood sample collection in some
patients was on the morning of the eighth admission day.
Serum CysC was measured with particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay method. CRP was measured with
immune transmission turbidity method, other biochemical
parameters such as creatinine, urea, and triglyceride were
measured with enzymatic method. All the serum biochemical parameters were assayed using an automatic
biochemical analyzer (Cobas 8000, Roche Diagnostics
GmbH, Mannheim, Germany).
We collected baseline demographic and clinical information for all participants including age, sex, and the presence of cerebral vascular risk factors such as hypertension
and diabetes. Hypertension was determined by the previous
use of antihypertensive medication, a systolic blood pressure
C140 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure C90 mmHg.
Blood pressure was measured on the admission day using a
mercury sphygmomanometer with a supine position of inpatients. Diabetes was determined by the previous use of
antidiabetic medication, fasting blood glucose C7.0 mM or
postprandial blood glucose after 2 h C11.1 mM.
The Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) Model
Male ICR mice (23–28 g) were purchased from SLAC
Company (Shanghai, China). All animal procedures were
approved by the University Committee on Animal Care of
Soochow University. MCAO was carried out using an intraluminal monofilament according to the method described previously (Xu et al. 2006). A 6–0 nylon
monofilament (Ethilon, Ethicon Inc., USA) coated with
silicon resin was inserted in the right internal carotid artery
about 9–11 mm. Reperfusion was achieved by withdrawing
the suture after 45 min or 75 min of MCAO. Sham mice
underwent the same experimental procedures but the nylon
filament was advanced only about 5 mm.
Intracerebroventricular Administration of CysC
CysC (Abcam Company, Cambridge, UK) or saline was
injected into the left lateral ventricle at 30 min before
MCAO via a small burr hole in the parietal region of mice
(0.5 mm posterior, 1.0 mm lateral, and 2.5 mm in depth to
the Bregma on the left side).
The Measurement of Infarct Volume
After 75 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion, the brains
were removed quickly and then were cut into 1-mm slices.

Neurotox Res (2015) 28:1–7

Slices were incubated with 0.2 % TTC (Sigma–Aldrich
Company, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) at 37 °C for 30 min.
The slices were photographed, and the infarct area in each
brain slice was analyzed. The percentage of hemispheric
infarction volume was calculated as described in our previous study (Chen et al. 2015).
Western Blotting Analysis
When the mice were sacrificed at different reperfusion time
points after 45 min of ischemia, ischemic brain tissues
were collected and were solubilized in lysis buffer. After
protein concentration determination, equal denatured proteins were electrophoresed in Tris–glycine sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12 %) and
electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were
incubated with primary antibodies against CysC (Abcam
Company, Cambridge, UK) at 4 °C overnight. After
washing, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1.5 h. Blots
were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence
system and were captured on Kodak autoradiographic
films. Films were scanned, and densitometric analysis of
the bands was performed with AlphaEase Image Analysis
software (Version 3.1.2).
Immunohistochemistry
After 45 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion, the mice
were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with saline
followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer (pH 7.4). Coronal sections including hippocampus
were cut using a freezing microtome. Sections were
mounted on slides for staining. Sections were pre-blocked
in 4 % normal goat serum/0.1 % Triton-X100 in PBS for
1 h and incubated with anti-CysC antibody (Abcam
Company, Cambridge, UK) at 4 °C overnight. Sections
were then rinsed and incubated with the avidin–biotin
complex (Vector ABC Elite, Burlingame) for 1 h. Immunoreactivity was visualized by incubation in 0.05 %
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma Company, St.
Louis, Missouri, USA) and 0.01 % hydrogen peroxide until
a brown product was observed. Micrographs were taken
under a light microscope with a camera.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted with the statistical
package for the social sciences version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous data were tested for normal
distribution using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Several
continuous variables that followed normal distribution,

3

such as creatinine (Cr), uric acid, total cholesterol (TC),
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and CysC, were expressed
as mean ± standard deviation; other variables that did not
follow normal distributions were presented as the median
and the interquartile range. Categorical variables are expressed as constituent ratios. Differences in categorical
variable distribution between groups were assessed by the
v2 test. Differences for continuous variables between
groups were assessed by Student’s t test or Mann–Whitney
U test. Spearman’s rank correlation method was used to
determine the correlation between serum CysC level and
NIHSS. Multiple logistic regression analyses were done to
investigate the associations between risk factors as independent variables and AIS as a dependent variable. p value
\0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Serum CysC Increases in Patients with First-ever AIS
There was no significant difference in age, sex, creatinine,
uric acid, total cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) between patients and control subjects. Compared with controls, patients with AIS had a higher
prevalence of hypertension or diabetes, higher blood
pressure, higher fasting blood glucose, urea, triglyceride,
high-density lipoprotein (HDL), LDL, and C-reactive
protein (CRP), as consistent with previous studies(Lisak
et al. 2013; Hsieh and Chiou 2014). Serum CysC in patients with AIS was significantly higher than that in controls (p \ 0.001; Table 1).
CysC Level is Highly Associated with AIS
Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association of AIS with multiple risk factors. AIS
was significantly associated with age (OR = 0.98, 95 %CI
0.96–0.99, p \ 0.01), hypertension (OR = 5.34, 95 %CI
3.84–7.44, p \ 0.001), diabetes (OR = 3.69, 95 %CI
2.30–5.94, p \ 0.001), urea (OR = 0.75, 95 %CI 0.65–0.87,
p \ 0.001), HDL (OR = 0.36, 95 %CI 0.21–0.61,
p \ 0.001), LDL (OR = 1.41, 95 %CI 1.16–1.71,
p \ 0.001), CRP (OR = 1.06, 95 %CI 1.01–1.11, p = 0.02),
and CysC (OR = 9.80, 95 %CI 3.12–30.83, p \ 0.001;
Table 2). The regression coefficient of CysC was positive and
its exponential was the highest of all the independent variables
(9.80), indicating that the risk of AIS in patients is more than
that in controls when CysC level increases one standard deviation. As a result, elevated levels of CysC were significantly
associated with first-ever ischemic stroke.
Patients and controls were pooled together to represent
an integrated population study and were divided into

(1.08–3.40), fifth quintile, 2.88 (1.49–5.54). The first,
second, and third quintiles of CysC had a similar risk of
AIS, the fourth and fifth quintiles were significantly associated with the increased risk of AIS (Table 3). We found
that quintiles 4 had approximately a doubled risk of stroke
(OR = 1.92) and quintiles 5 had nearly a tripled risk in
adjusted analysis (OR = 2.88). This result showed that an
abnormal increase in serum CysC predicted the high risk of
AIS.

no correlation with NIHSS (r = -0.008, p = 0.85), indicating that serum CysC was not significantly consistent
with the symptoms of AIS.
Moreover, among patients with AIS, 289 patients suffered anterior circulation stroke; 143 patients suffered

group

We found that CysC expression significantly increased at
6 h after I/R injury, reached a peak at 24 h, and decreased
at 48 h after I/R injury (Fig. 2a). Quantitative analysis
confirmed this change (p \ 0.05, Fig. 2b). This increase
was confirmed by immunohistochemistry staining
(Fig. 2c). At 24 h after reperfusion, more CysC expression
was observed in the ischemic cortex (Fig. 2c). We further
administered (i.c.v.) CysC (50 ng for each mice) at 30 min
before ischemia. CysC significantly reduced infarct volume
at 24 h after I/R injury (Fig. 2d). Similarly, increased doses
of CysC (100 or 200 ng) also provided protection on infarct
size (p \ 0.05, Fig. 2e).

Discussion
posterior circulation stroke; the remainder suffered multiple infarction including anterior circulation and posterior
circulation stroke. Serum CysC levels in three groups were
compared; the difference was not significant (p [ 0.05).
These results showed that serum CysC was not related to
the location of ischemic area.
CysC Level Decreases after Stroke Therapy
Patients (n = 103) with AIS were given similar treatment
for one week according to the Guideline of AIS of China.
Compared with serum CysC level before treatment, serum
CysC significantly decreased after one week of unthrombolytic treatment (1.05 ± 0.19 vs. 0.99 ± 0.18 mg/L,
p \ 0.001; Fig. 1).
CysC Provides Neuroprotective Effects on Cerebral
Ischemia/Reperfusion (I/R) Injury in a Mouse MCAO
Model
To explore the role of CysC on ischemic brain injury, we
first examined the expression of CysC at different time
points after cerebral I/R injury in a mouse MCAO model.

In this study, the serum CysC level was significantly higher
in patients with AIS than in controls. After the adjustment for
age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, creatinine, urea, uric acid,
triglyceride, HDL, LDL, and CRP, AIS was found to be
highly associated with serum CysC, indicating that elevated
CysC is an independent risk predictor. Our data also, for the
first time, demonstrated the protective effect of CysC on
infarct volume in an animal ischemic brain injury model.
In agreement with previous studies (Ni et al. 2007; Xiao
et al. 2012), we found that serum CysC was not associated
with the severity of the clinical symptoms and the location
of ischemic areas. In addition, we observed a decreased
tendency of serum CysC after AIS: serum CysC increased
within 3 days after AIS and significantly decreased after
1 week, which is consistent with the expression of CysC in
ischemic brain tissues in a mouse MCAO model. A previous study showed that the reduction of CysC by knockout
aggravates brain damage following focal ischemia (Olsson
et al. 2004). Our data support this and confirm that exogenous CysC provided neuroprotective effects on I/R injury (Fig. 2). This suggests that elevated serum CysC in
patients may play a protective role in ischemic injury.

Fig. 2 CysC reduced infarct volume in a mouse MCAO model. At
different time points after I/R injury in a mouse MCAO model, the
ischemic brain tissues were collected for Western blot. The
representative graph showed the expression of CysC after I/R injury
(a). The quantitative analysis was performed. N = 3. b CysC
expression was observed in the ischemic cortex and the non-ischemic

(contralateral) cortex (c). Mice were administered (i.c.v.) CysC
(50 ng) at 30 min before ischemia. TTC staining was carried out at
24 h after I/R injury. The representative TTC staining of brain slices
was shown (d). Different doses of CysC were administered and
infarct volume was analyzed. N = 6–8. e *p \ 0.05, versus I/R group

Under ischemic stimuli, neuronal cells, including neurons
and astrocytes, may release high levels of CysC as a defensive mechanism to inhibit cysteine protease activity.
This contrasts with the reported elevation in Cathepsin B
after ischemic injury, being associated with increased cell
death (Seyfried et al. 1997). At the same time, serum CysC
decreased with the treatment and functional recovery.
However, it is not clear that the decrease in serum CysC
after treatment was due to the treatment or the natural

metabolism of CysC as shown in our animal study. Xiao
et al. (2012) had found that the larger cerebral infarction
size in patients with AIS is associated with higher serum
CysC. Therefore, CysC may be a predictor for the severity
of ischemia and cell damage.
One limitation to our study was that no long-term follow-up was able to be carried out. The follow-up of serum
CysC and neurological evaluation as well as stroke events
in 1 and 3 months needs further investigation.

123

Neurotox Res (2015) 28:1–7

In summary, serum CysC is positively associated with
AIS and can be used as an independent risk factor for AIS.
Because exogenous CysC exerted neuroprotective effects
on ischemic brain injury in mice, CysC is a novel and
promising therapeutic target for the treatment of AIS.
