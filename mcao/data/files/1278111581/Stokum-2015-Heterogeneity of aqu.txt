expression after focal cerebral ischemia underlies
differences in white versus grey matter swelling

Abstract
Introduction: Ischemic stroke, a major cause of mortality, is frequently accompanied by life-threatening cerebral
edema. Aquaporin-4 (Aqp4), an astrocytic transmembrane water channel, is an important molecular contributor to
cerebral edema formation. Past studies of Aqp4 expression and localization after ischemia examined grey matter
exclusively. However, as white matter astrocytes differ developmentally, physiologically, and molecularly from grey
matter astrocytes, we hypothesized that functionally important regional heterogeneity exists in Aqp4 expression
and subcellular localization following cerebral ischemia.
Results: Subcellular localization of Aqp4 was compared between cortical and white matter astrocytes in postmortem
specimens of patients with focal ischemic stroke versus controls. Subcellular localization and expression of Aqp4 was
examined in rats subjected to experimental stroke. Volumetric analysis was performed on the cortex and white matter
of rats subjected to experimental stroke. Following cerebral ischemia, cortical astrocytes exhibited reduced perivascular
Aqp4 and unchanged Aqp4 protein abundance. In contrast, white matter astrocytes exhibited increased perivascular
and plasmalemmal Aqp4 and a 2.2- to 6.2-fold increase in Aqp4 isoform abundance. Ischemic white matter swelled by
approximately 40 %, while cortex swelled by approximately 9 %.
Conclusions: The findings reported here raise the possibility that cerebral white matter may play a heretofore
underappreciated role in the formation of cerebral edema following ischemia.

Introduction
Worldwide, stroke is the second most common cause of
death, accounting for approximately 11.5 % of deaths
[1]. Ischemic stroke alone accounts for 2.8 million
deaths annually [1]. Malignant infarction, characterized
by life-threatening cerebral edema, occurs in 1–10 % of
patients with supratentorial infarctions, usually within
2–5 days of the ictus, and is associated with a mortality
rate of almost 80 % [2–4]. Cerebral edema is also associated with poor patient outcomes, even in the context of
non-malignant infarction volumes [5].
In recent decades, knowledge of the mechanisms of
cerebral edema formation has greatly improved [6, 7].
Much of this work has focused on cortical or striatal

grey matter, partially because rodents, which are commonly used in preclinical studies to model stroke, have
relatively little cerebral white matter [8]. However, grey
matter and white matter differ in architecture [9–11],
cellular composition, and function. There is a growing
recognition that the classical morphological division of
cerebral astrocytes – key cellular mediators of cerebral
edema formation – into white matter (fibrous) and grey
matter (protoplasmic) subtypes [12] is developmentally
[13–15], molecularly [16–19], and physiologically [20–22]
justifiable. Given that the human prefrontal cerebrum
is ~2/5ths white matter [23], white matter integrity
after stroke is a stronger functional predictor than preserved neurological function [24]. Insofar as certain
studies indicate that white matter is highly susceptible
to swelling after acute CNS injury [25, 26], it is important to determine whether astrocyte regional heterogeneity

manifests as significant differences in certain molecular
events that drive cerebral edema formation.
Aquaporin-4 (Aqp4) is a passive transmembrane water
channel that in the central nervous system (CNS) is exclusively expressed by astrocytes, and is an important
molecular contributor to cerebral edema formation after
cerebral ischemia [27–31]. Aqp4 protein abundance is
directly correlated with the magnitude of edema [28, 30].
Consensus exists that, in cortical astrocytes, Aqp4 mRNA
increases 3 days post-ictus [32, 33]. Protein abundance examined at similar times has been reported to be decreased
(~50 %) [34], unchanged [35], or slightly (~10 %) increased [33], with this heterogeneity possibly due to differences in tissue harvesting or to the specific parameters of
the stroke model studied.
The subcellular localization of Aqp4 is central to its
physiological [36] and pathological [37] roles. In healthy
grey and white matter astrocytes, Aqp4 is localized
mostly to the perivascular endfeet [38], the terminal
pads of large astrocyte processes that completely ensheath all cerebral vessels [10, 39], where it mostly exists
as large multimers called orthogonal arrays of intramembraneous particles (OAPs). OAPs cover approximately
50 % of the endfoot plasmalemma [38, 40], where they
greatly increase its water permeability [40]. OAP formation is necessary for endfoot localization [41], and is
mostly determined by the relative membrane abundance
of the two major Aqp4 isoforms, the “small” M23 isoform and the “large” M1 isoform [41–43]. Because the
M1 isoform limits OAP size, larger M23:M1 ratios result
in larger OAP formation and more Aqp4 localization to
the astrocyte endfoot (a.k.a., Aqp4 polarization) [41–43].
The degree of Aqp4 polarization is correlated with the
magnitude of edema formation following cerebral ischemia [35, 37, 44, 45]. Following cerebral ischemia,
astrocytes alter the M23/M1 expression ratio [46], a
transcriptional change that might mechanistically underlie observations that, in grey matter, CNS injury triggers a
redistribution of Aqp4 away from the endfoot [35, 47, 48].
This phenomenon has been speculated to protect against
local formation of edema fluid [35].
All prior studies of Aqp4 in the context of cerebral ischemia and trauma have focused on grey matter astrocytes. To determine whether white matter and grey
matter astrocytes exhibit different patterns of Aqp4 subcellular localization or abundance following cerebral ischemia, here we examined Aqp4 subcellular localization
in cortical grey matter versus white matter astrocytes in
postmortem brain tissues from humans who had suffered from an ischemic stroke. We also examined Aqp4
subcellular localization and abundance of the M1 and
M23 isoforms in cortical grey matter and subcortical
white matter (lateral corpus callosum and external capsule) astrocytes at different times after reperfusion in a

rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
To determine whether grey matter and white matter exhibit different propensities for tissue swelling, we compared the relative volume increase exhibited by cortex
versus subcortical white matter in the rat MCAO model
of stroke.

Materials and methods
Human brain tissue

All procedures pertaining to human subjects were approved by the University of Maryland School of Medicine
Institutional Review Board. Three patients, 2 men and 1
woman aged 61, 64, and 37 years, who died within 5 days
of documented focal cerebral ischemia and who underwent autopsy between January 2010 and December 2012
were retrospectively identified by review of the records of
the Department of Pathology. Histological validation of
the presence of an ischemic lesion in these cases was
made by a board certified neuropathologist (R.I.M.); these
tissues were a subset of those used in a previous study
[49]. Lesions were located in the right posterior communicating artery territory, the left middle cerebral artery territory, or the right frontal lobe. A 54 year old male and
57 year old female both of whom had died rapidly from
acute aortic dissection were used for controls. Postmortem intervals were 15–52 hours. Human brain tissues were
submitted to standard postmortem fixation consisting of
7–10 days in formalin and cryoprotection (30 % sucrose)
prior to cryosectioning (10 μm) for immunohistochemistry.
Rat model of stroke

All procedures pertaining to experimental animals were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of Maryland School of
Medicine. Male Wistar rats (250 to 300 g; Harlan,
Indianapolis, IN) were anesthetized (50 mg/kg ketamine
and 7.5 mg/kg xylazine intraperitoneally). Body temperature
was maintained with a heating pad regulated by rectal
temperature (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) and rats
were allowed to spontaneously ventilate room air. The
skull was thinned 2 mm rostral and 2 mm lateral to the
bregma, and a laser Doppler probe was affixed to the skull
using α-cyanoacrylate adhesive. The right common, external and internal carotid arteries (CCA, ECA, ICA) were
exposed by a ventral midline incision. The CCA, distal
ECA and pterygopalatine artery were tied off prior to bisection of the ECA. A commercially available intra-arterial
occluder (0.39 mm; 4039PK5Re; Doccol Corp, Redlands
CA) was used. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
was obtained by inserting the occluder retrograde into the
external carotid artery (ECA) and advancing it into the
ICA under guidance of the Doppler flowmeter. Only animals with a drop in relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF)
>75 % were included for further study. After 120 minutes

Stokum et al. Acta Neuropathologica Communications (2015) 3:61

of MCAO, the occluder was withdrawn, the ECA was ligated and flow was restored in the CCA/ICA.
Animals were sacrificed after 2, 10, 24, or 48 hours of
reperfusion by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital.
Uninjured animals served as controls. Following euthanasia, animals were intracardially perfused with saline and
4 % paraformaldehyde. The brain was removed and
immersion fixed for 24 hours followed by cryoprotection
(30 % sucrose).
To ensure that ketamine anesthesia does not affect
Aqp4 expression, total Aqp4 protein abundance was
quantified in the cortex and subcortical white matter of
animals submitted to intraperitoneal injection of either
50 mg/kg of ketamine (n = 3), or an equivalent volume
of saline (n = 3). Immunoblot revealed no differences in
Aqp4 expression in the cortex (p = 0.45) or subcortical
white matter (p = 0.70) between rats administered saline
and rats administered ketamine.
Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL

For human tissues, antigen retrieval was performed prior
to immunolabeling. Slides were immersed in IHC-Tek
Epitope Retrieval Solution (IHC WORLD, LLC; IW1100), microwaved for 2 minutes and cooled at room
temperature for 3 minutes; this protocol was repeated
three times. Sections were allowed to rest at room
temperature for 20 minutes, rinsed briefly in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), and blocked for 1 hour in 2 %
donkey serum with 0.2 % TritonX-100. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary polyclonal
rabbit antibody against Aqp4 (AB3594; Millipore, Billerica, MA) and double labeled with either anti-S100
(ab7852; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) or anti-CD31
(M0823; Dako, Carpinteria, CA) antibody. The following
day, Alexa Fluor 550- or fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated secondary antibodies (A31570 and A21206;
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) were applied prior to coverslipping with ProLong Gold antifade
reagent (P36930; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Omission of primary antibody was used as a negative control.
For rat tissues, coronal cryosections (12 μm) were obtained starting from approximately 4.5 mm posterior to
bregma. Tissues were blocked for 1 hour in 2 % donkey
serum and 0.2 % TritonX-100. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit primary antibody
against Aqp4 (AB3594; Millipore) and double-labeled
with mouse primary antibody against GFAP (C9205;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or rat endothelial cell
antigen-1 (RECA-1) (MA1-81510; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The following day, Alexa Fluor 550- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies
were applied prior to coverslipping with ProLong Gold
antifade reagent (P36930; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.)
Omission of primary antibody was used as a negative

control. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed on cryosections as per kit instructions (11684795910; Roche,
Branchburg, NJ). See Table 1 for immunohistochemistry
markers.
The specificity of the anti-Aqp4 antibody was validated
by confirmation of expected localization of Aqp4 immunoreactivity in control human and rat cortical tissues
and by confirmation of expected molecular weight bands
in immunoblot of control rat brain tissue (Additional file
1: Figure. S1).
Regions of interest - immunohistochemistry

For immunohistochemical analysis of rat brain sections,
three mutually exclusive regions of interest (ROI) were
defined. The first ROI was defined within the cortical
penumbra, a zone of ischemic, but still viable tissue that
in the MCAO model reliably includes the superior
ACA-MCA watershed region [50–52]. The center of the
cortical penumbra ROI was defined as a rectangle of
1 mm width extending from pia to subcortical white
matter, set orthogonally to the pial surface and offset laterally from the midline by 3 mm. The value of the lateral
offset was obtained from averaging the distance between
midline and onset of necrosis in the cortex identified
with TUNEL staining among 3 rats sacrificed after
24 hours reperfusion. The second ROI, a square of
500 μm, was placed lateral to the first ROI in the necrotic ischemic core. The third ROI was hand drawn over
the subcortical white matter ipsilateral to MCAO to include the lateral corpus callosum and external capsule.
Image analysis - immunohistochemistry

For quantification of perivascular Aqp4 in rat tissues,
sections were double-labeled for Aqp4 and RECA-1 and
three epifluorescence images were obtained at random
locations within each ROI using a 20x air objective.
From each image, a random microvessel oriented parallel to the slice plane was selected. With assistance from
the RECA-1 channel, the microvessel was segmented by
hand prior to summation of the Aqp4 signal and
normalization to the microvessel area. Signals from the
three microvessels were then averaged and normalized
to the average value of the control microvessels.
Immunoblot analysis

For quantification of Aqp4 protein abundance in rat tissues, brains from rats submitted to 120 minutes MCAO
were harvested after 48 hours reperfusion. Brains were
isolated and 3 mm coronal slabs were cut; a slab that
bridged from approximately 1 mm anterior to bregma
to −2 mm posterior to bregma was isolated. Coronal
slabs from control and from rats submitted to MCAO
were stained with 2 % triphenyl tetrazolium chloride

(TTC) dissolved in 0.9 % saline for 20 minutes at room
temperature to determine the location of the ischemic
core and penumbra; this technique does not affect the
quality of isolated RNA or protein [53]. The necrotic
tissue (white) was removed and discarded (the core was
not analyzed due to protein degradation) whereas the
surrounding cortical penumbra (red) and the ipsilateral
subcortical white matter (lateral corpus callosum and
external capsule) were dissected, homogenized in lysis
buffer (1 % Triton X-100 in 1 x dPBS), and analyzed by
immunoblot. Proteins were detected using anti-Aqp4
(AB3594; Millipore) and anti-Hsc-70 (sc-7298; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX).
Silver infarct staining

For silver staining, 12 μm cryosections were briefly
washed with PBS, submerged for 2 minutes in a silver impregnation solution with vigorous shaking, washed 6x in
deionized water, submerged for 3 minutes in a developer
solution, washed 3x in deionized water, and coverslipped
with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (P36930; Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.). The impregnation and the developer solutions were prepared according the protocol described in Vogel et al. [54]. Stained sections were digitized,
converted to greyscale and inverted. ROIs used for analysis corresponded to those used for analysis of immunohistochemistry data. The pixel intensity within each ROI
was summed and normalized to ROI area.
Measurement of tissue swelling

For swelling analysis, tissues were obtained from rats
submitted to a 4.5 hour MCAO with 24 hours of reperfusion; a longer MCAO was used for this experiment to
maximize edema formation. Coronal cryosections of
40 μm thickness separated by 460 μm were sectioned sequentially from a 2 mm coronal block centered at approximately 1 mm posterior to bregma.
First, to distinguish subcortical white matter from cortical grey matter, sections were stained with the myelin
stain Black Gold II as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Histo-Chem Inc., USA), and counterstained with
Cresyl Violet, a nuclear stain. Stained sections were digitized to the RGB (red-green-blue) color space and converted to the HSI (hue-saturation-intensity) color space,
whereupon the hue channel was isolated and used for all
downstream image analysis.

For each section, the ipsilateral and contralateral cortical grey matter and subcortical white matter (lateral
corpus callosum and external capsule) was segmented
for volumetric analysis. To minimize bias in defining the
boundary between cortical grey matter and subcortical
white matter, the segmentation of subcortical white matter was automated using an active contour segmentation
algorithm, as implemented in the Snake: Active Contour
MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) toolkit [55]. On
each section, an initial contour that outlined the subcortical white matter was initialized by hand. This initial
contour was then fitted to the image by optimizing the
external and internal energies of the contour through
100 iterations of the active contour algorithm. A medial
boundary was then defined on the output subcortical
white matter segmentation and corresponded to a line
oriented normal to the superior zenith of the rostralcaudal fibers of the corpus callosum. Next, the cortex
segmentation was defined by hand; the lateral margin of
the subcortical white matter segmentation was used as
the medial boundary of the cortical grey matter segmentation. The volume of each segmented region was then
estimated by the rectangular estimation of morphometric volume,

V ¼d

n
X

Ai

where d is the distance between sections, Ai is the area
of the ith of n segmented regions, and V is the volume
of the segmented region.
Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using the R software package
(available at www.r-project.org) and plotted using OriginPro version 7 (Origin Lab Corp., Northampton, MA). A
value of 0.05 was used to evaluate significance for all tests.
For the analysis of immunohistochemistry data, prior to
group comparisons with ANOVA and post-hoc tests with
Tukey’s test, Levene’s test was applied to ensure homoscedasticity. For immunoblot analysis, Student’s t-test was
used for comparison between control and MCAO groups.
For measurement of tissue swelling, Student’s t-test was
used for comparison.

Results
Aqp4 subcellular localization in ischemic stroke

Human brain tissues from control and ischemic stroke
cases were immunolabeled for Aqp4 to determine whether
white matter and grey matter astrocytes exhibit different
patterns of Aqp4 subcellular localization following ischemic
stroke. In control cortical tissue, cerebral microvessels were
strongly immunoreactive for Aqp4, whereas the parenchyma exhibited only weak, diffuse “background” immunoreactivity (Fig. 1a). In contrast, in ischemic grey matter,
perivascular Aqp4 immunoreactivity was decreased, indicating loss of Aqp4 polarization (Fig. 1b). Double labeling
for CD31, an endothelial marker, confirmed this observation: Microvessels in control cortex exhibited strong and
continuous perivascular Aqp4 (Fig. 1c), whereas microvessels in ischemic cortex were outlined by weaker and discontinuous Aqp4 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1d). To determine if

Page 5 of 16

Aqp4 was redistributed from the endfoot domain to the
plasmalemma of the soma and main processes, tissues
were double labeled for S100, an astrocyte marker.
Neither astrocytes in the control cortex (Fig. 1e) nor the
ischemic cortex (Fig. 1f) exhibited appreciable Aqp4 immunoreactivity at the somata or main processes.
In control human white matter, the parenchyma was very
weakly immunoreactive for Aqp4 (Fig. 2a). In this tissue, infrequent weakly immunoreactive astrocytes were observed;
in these cells, Aqp4 was not polarized to the endfoot, but
rather was distributed uniformly over the entire plasmalemma (Fig. 2a). Aqp4 immunoreactivity was strikingly increased in ischemic white matter (Fig. 2b). In contrast with
microvessels in ischemic grey matter, compared to control
(Fig. 2c), microvessels in ischemic white matter exhibited
greatly increased perivascular Aqp4 (Fig. 2d). Unlike astrocytes in ischemic grey matter, compared to control

(Fig. 2e), astrocytes in ischemic white matter exhibited
greatly increased Aqp4 immunoreactivity across the entire plasmalemma (Fig. 2f ). Interestingly, in ischemic
white matter, rare S100 positive astrocytes remained
completely Aqp4 negative (Fig. 2g).
Rat MCAO model of ischemic stroke

To better understand the regional heterogeneity of
changes in Aqp4 subcellular localization and expression

after cerebral ischemia, ischemic stroke was modeled by
2 hour transient rat MCAO with variable reperfusion
times. TTC staining indicated that this model results in
a cortical and striatal infarct (Fig. 3a). In the transient
rat MCAO model, penumbral tissue, i.e. ischemic but
still viable tissue, is reliably located at the cortical ACAMCA watershed [50–52]. The location of the cortical
ACA-MCA watershed was estimated by measuring
where the spread of necrosis, identified with TUNEL

labeling, along the cortex halted at 24 hours reperfusion
(Fig. 3b). For analysis of coronal sections from the rat
MCAO model, three ROIs were defined: (1) cortical
penumbra at the cortical ACA-MCA watershed, (2) necrotic cortical infarct core, located lateral to the cortical
penumbra ROI and (3) the ipsilateral subcortical white
matter including the lateral corpus callosum and external capsule (Fig. 3c).
Given that the subcortical white matter was TUNEL
negative (Fig. 3b), we sought to confirm that the ipsilateral subcortical white matter was indeed submitted to ischemic injury in the rat MCAO model. As TTC is a
poor indicator of white matter ischemia, we instead used
silver staining, a protocol that is sensitive to postischemic changes in both grey matter and white matter
[54]. In tissue obtained from rats after 24 hours of reperfusion, silver staining was attenuated in a spatial pattern
(Fig. 3d) that closely corresponded to the ischemic region identified with TTC (Fig. 3a). Quantification revealed that, compared with contralateral cortex and
subcortical white matter, silver staining of the ipsilateral
cortex was decreased by 30.8 % ± 4.37 % (p = 0.003) and

silver staining of the ipsilateral subcortical white matter was decreased by a nearly equivalent 35.8 % ±
6.08 % (p = 0.002) (Fig. 3e). Absence of TUNEL labeling, coupled with attenuated silver staining indicated
that the ipsilateral subcortical white matter was submitted to ischemic injury, but ultimately remained viable and non-necrotic.
Aqp4 immunoreactivity after MCAO

In the control cortex, the vasculature was outlined by
strong and continuous Aqp4 immunoreactivity and the
parenchyma was weakly immunoreactive (Fig. 4a). Perivascular Aqp4 immunoreactivity was weaker in the cortical penumbra after 24 hours of reperfusion (Fig. 4b)
and largely absent in the cortical infarct core after
24 hours of reperfusion (Fig. 4c).
In the control subcortical white matter, microvessels
exhibited moderate Aqp4 immunoreactivity and the parenchymal labeling was weak in intensity and reticulate
in appearance (Fig. 4d). Aqp4 immunoreactivity greatly
increased in subcortical white matter after 48 hours of
reperfusion and appeared to outline cellular processes

and cerebral microvessels (Fig. 4e), a pattern that differed markedly from that observed in the ischemic
cortex.
Perivascular Aqp4 after MCAO

We sought to determine if regionally heterogeneous
changes occur in Aqp4 localization to the perivascular
endfoot. Tissues from rats subjected to 120 minute
MCAO with 2, 10, 24, or 48 hours of reperfusion were
double-labeled for RECA-1, a marker for rat endothelial
cells, and analyzed for perivascular Aqp4 intensity.
In control cortical tissue, microvessels were outlined
by strong Aqp4 immunoreactivity (Fig. 5a, d). In the cortical infarct core, perivascular Aqp4 was nearly absent
after 10 hours of reperfusion (Fig. 5b) and remained
weakly immunoreactive after 48 hours of reperfusion
(Fig. 5c). Similar, but temporally delayed changes in perivascular Aqp4 were observed in the cortical penumbra:
Here, perivascular Aqp4 became attenuated after 10 hours
of reperfusion (Fig. 5e) and was largely absent by 48 hours
of reperfusion (Fig. 5f).
In control subcortical white matter, perivascular Aqp4
immunoreactivity was visibly weaker than that in the
control cortex (Fig. 5g). After 10 hours reperfusion,
microvessels in the subcortical white matter remained
outlined by weak Aqp4 immunoreactivity (Fig. 5h).
However, after 48 hours reperfusion, perivascular Aqp4

immunoreactivity in the subcortical white matter strongly
increased to levels similar to or greater than those observed in the control cortex (Fig. 5i).
The temporal pattern of perivascular Aqp4 immunoreactivity was quantified in the three ROIs. After homoscedasticity was confirmed with the Levene test in the
cortical penumbra (W = 0.7095 p = 0.598), cortical infarct core (W = 0.2207, p = 0.9227), and subcortical white
matter (W = 0.3058 p = 0.8676), ANOVA revealed that
significant differences existed among experimental
groups in the penumbra (F = 17.94, p = 1.38x10−5), cortical infarct core (F = 13.43, p = 7.57x10−5) and subcortical white matter (F = 21.52, p = 6.69x10−5). Post-hoc
tests revealed that perivascular Aqp4 intensity in penumbra was lower than control levels at 10, 24 and
48 hours reperfusion, that perivascular Aqp4 intensity in
cortical infarct core was lower than control levels at 2,
10, 24, and 48 hours reperfusion, and that perivascular
Aqp4 immunoreactivity in ischemic subcortical white
matter was higher than control levels at 24 and 48 hours
reperfusion (Fig. 5j).

changes occur as to where Aqp4 is redistributed on the

of reperfusion were double-labeled for GFAP, the
astrocyte-specific intermediate filament. Notably, GFAP
labeling was quickly lost in the cortical infarct core, a
change that likely reflected astrocyte cell death and tissue
necrosis. Therefore, the present analysis was restricted to
the cortical penumbra and subcortical white matter, where
GFAP labeling was not lost following MCAO.
In the control cortex, the plasmalemmae of astrocytic
somata and non-endfoot processes were only weakly
Aqp4 immunoreactive (Fig. 6a). At no time examined after
reperfusion did these cellular structures display increased
Aqp4 immunoreactivity, although penumbral astrocytes
after 48 hours of reperfusion were hypertrophied and exhibited increased GFAP immunoreactivity, both indications of a reactive phenotype (Fig. 6b, c).
In control subcortical white matter, the astrocyte
somata and processes exhibited moderate Aqp4 immunoreactivity (Fig. 6d), a pattern that was largely unchanged after 10 hours of reperfusion (Fig. 6e). However,
after 48 hours of reperfusion, subcortical white matter
astrocytes exhibited greatly increased Aqp4 immunoreactivity at the somata and main processes (Fig. 6f ), a pattern that was appreciably different than the pattern
exhibited by astrocytes in the cortex. Like astrocytes in
the cortical penumbra after 48 hours of reperfusion,
subcortical white matter astrocytes after 48 hours of reperfusion were hypertrophied and exhibited increased
GFAP immunoreactivity (Fig. 6f ).
Aqp4 abundance after MCAO

We sought to determine if regionally heterogeneous
changes occur in Aqp4 abundance. The cortical penumbra and the ipsilateral subcortical white matter were analyzed with immunoblot. Immunoblot resulted in two bands
at ~30 kDa, a band at ~33 kDa, and two bands at ~4050 kDa, which correspond to the expected molecular
weights for monomeric M1, M23, monomeric Mz, and dimeric M1 and M23, respectively [56].
After 48 hours of reperfusion, the cortical penumbra
did not exhibit altered abundance of monomeric M1,
M23, or Mz, or dimeric M1 or M23 (Fig. 6g). In contrast, after MCAO, subcortical white matter exhibited
increased abundance of all isoforms of Aqp4 (Fig. 6g).
Quantification of the abundance of Aqp4 monomers
in cortical penumbra confirmed unchanged abundance
of monomeric M1 or M23 after MCAO (Fig. 6h). In
contrast, quantification of the abundance of Aqp4
monomers in subcortical white matter revealed a 2.2 ±
0.36–fold increase (p = 0.024) in monomeric M1 and a
2.4 ± 0.38–fold increase (p = 0.028) in monomeric M23
after MCAO compared to control (Fig. 6h). Quantification of the monomeric Mz isoform revealed that in cortical grey matter, monomeric Mz abundance was
unchanged after MCAO, while subcortical white matter

Page 11 of 16

exhibited a 2.2 ± 0.26–fold increase (p = 0.03) in monomeric Mz after MCAO compared to control.
Quantification of the abundance of Aqp4 dimers in
cortical penumbra confirmed unchanged abundance of
dimeric M1 or M23 after MCAO, although the M1
dimer trended towards greater abundance after MCAO
(Fig. 6i). In contrast, quantification of the abundance of
Aqp4 dimers in subcortical white matter revealed a 2.5 ±
0.39–fold increase (p = 0.021) in dimeric M1 and a 6.2 ±
1.72–fold increase (p = 0.038) in dimeric M23 after
MCAO compared to control (Fig. 6i).

Regional swelling after MCAO

Since Aqp4 has been associated with astrocyte and tissue
swelling, we sought to determine if cortical grey matter
and subcortical white matter swell with different relative
magnitudes following MCAO. Coronal slices were stained
with Black Gold II, a myelin stain, and counter stained
with cresyl violet, a nuclear stain, prior to digitization, segmentation, and volumetric quantification of ipsilateral versus contralateral cortex and subcortical white matter.
Stained coronal sections exhibited intense Black Gold II
staining in the subcortical white matter (corpus callosum
and external capsule) and strong cresyl violet staining in
the cerebral cortex, with these regions separated by an indistinct boundary (Fig. 7a). The right (ipsilateral) side exhibited swelling in both cortex and subcortical white
matter with apparent necrosis in the superior-lateral cortex (Fig. 7a). Input images were transformed from RGB to
HSI color space, whereupon the hue channel was isolated
(Fig. 7b). Segmentation of each hue image yielded 4 ROIs,
corresponding to ipsilateral and contralateral cortex and
subcortical white matter (Fig. 7c). The area occupied by
each segmented ROI was calculated and, using the rectangular estimation of morphometric volume, was used to
calculate the volume of each ROI.
The ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheric volume,
excluding the striatum and diencephalon, were estimated as the combined ipsilateral ROIs (cortex plus
subcortical white matter) and the combined contralateral ROIs. Overall, the ipsilateral hemisphere was
12.5 % ± 3 % larger in volume than the contralateral
hemisphere (p = 0.006) (Fig. 7d).
Next, we sought to determine the relative volume increase exhibited by the cortex and the subcortical white
matter. The ipsilateral cortex was 13.23 ± 3.95 mm3 larger in volume than the contralateral cortex (p = 0.02), an
8.95 % ± 2.64 % increase (Fig. 7e). A similar calculation
revealed that the ipsilateral subcortical white matter
was 7.42 ± 1.73 mm3 larger in volume (p = 0.017) than
the contralateral subcortical white matter, a 42.5 % ±
8.84 % increase (Fig. 7e). Importantly, the relative increase in volume exhibited by subcortical white matter

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that subcortical
white matter and cortical grey matter astrocytes react to
ischemia with strikingly different changes in Aqp4 subcellular localization and expression, and that subcortical
white matter is much more susceptible to post-ischemic
tissue swelling than cortical grey matter. The findings reported here have important implications for the field of
astrocyte regional heterogeneity [22], and for the current
understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms
that drive cerebral edema formation and clearance.
The present study is the first to examine post-ischemic
changes in Aqp4 expression or localization in cerebral
white matter, and is the first to contrast these changes
with those that occur in grey matter astrocytes; all other
studies of Aqp4 in the context of cerebral ischemia have
focused on grey matter [32–34, 46, 47, 57–59]. The
present study also is novel in that it is the first to report

molecular differences between reactive white matter and
grey matter astrocytes in the ischemic brain; prior studies of regional heterogeneity in reactive cerebral astrocytes have either focused on grey matter [60, 61], or
compared cell survival after ischemia [62, 63].
In rat and human cortical astrocytes, perivascular
Aqp4 was quickly attenuated following cerebral ischemia, which, in the rat cortical penumbra, was accompanied by unchanged Aqp4 abundance of either the M1 or
M23 isoform in either the monomeric or dimeric state.
This post-ischemic pattern of subcellular localization
and protein abundance is similar to that reported elsewhere [34, 35, 48, 58], and has been interpreted as a redistribution of Aqp4 away from the astrocyte endfoot.
The mechanism underlying this redistribution is unclear:
While the M1 homodimer, the isoform that tends to reduce OAP size and Aqp4 polarization [41, 46], trended
upwards in cortical astrocytes, the M23:M1 ratio was
largely unchanged after ischemia. This result indicates
that a decreased M23/M1 ratio is not a necessary
prerequisite for Aqp4 plasmalemmal redistribution to

Stokum et al. Acta Neuropathologica Communications (2015) 3:61

occur. Alternatively, loss of Aqp4 polarization might
have been driven by degradation of vascular basement
membrane proteins, some of which function to anchor
Aqp4 at the endfoot [64–67].
Surprisingly, in cortical astrocytes, we did not observe
increased Aqp4 immunoreactivity at the astrocytic
somata or main processes; this phenomenon was previously reported to co-occur with reduced perivascular
localization [47]. This discrepancy with the prior literature may be due to differences in the species analyzed
(human and rat versus mouse), details of the stroke
model (120 min rat MCAO versus 30 min mouse
MCAO), or regional heterogeneity between cortical and
striatal astrocytes [68], as the latter were examined in
the aforementioned study. While the final location of
Aqp4 in astrocytes in the ischemic cortex is unclear, the
diffuse pattern of immunoreactivity in the parenchyma
of the cortical penumbra may suggest that Aqp4 is localized to the finely ramified cortical astrocyte processes,
perhaps to participate in glutamate/water buffering [69].
We found that, in contrast with astrocytes in the ischemic cortex, astrocytes in ischemic subcortical white
matter exhibited increased perivascular endfoot Aqp4
following ischemia. Increased endfoot Aqp4 may have
been driven by the increased dimeric M23, and hence
the increased M23/M1 ratio observed in immunoblot
analysis. Notably, interpretation of the M23/M1 ratio
and the dimer state of Aqp4 [56] is difficult, as scant literature exists regarding these topics. Regarding the
former, one study reported that the M1 isoform, but not
M23 isoform, was increased in striatal astrocytes [46].
Furthermore, and again in contrast with astrocytes in
the ischemic cortex, astrocytes in ischemic subcortical
white matter exhibited a 2.2–6.2 fold increase in Aqp4
protein abundance, and greatly upregulated Aqp4 at the
plasmalemma of the soma and main processes. The
overall magnitude of Aqp4 upregulation in subcortical
white matter was visually striking, and is best appreciated in Fig. 2a, b and Fig. 4d, e.
Interestingly, we found that cortical grey matter and
subcortical white matter exhibit greatly different propensities for tissue swelling after cerebral ischemia. After ischemia, the ipsilateral cortical grey matter was swollen
by 8.95 % ± 2.64 % compared to the contralateral cortex,
while the ipsilateral subcortical white matter was swollen
by a remarkable 42.5 % ± 8.84 %.These findings are in
alignment with data from prior studies showing that
white matter is highly susceptible to swelling after acute
CNS injury [25, 26]. There are at least two possible
mechanistic explanations for the striking swelling exhibited by subcortical white matter: firstly, for reasons yet
to be clarified, subcortical white matter may be more
susceptible to the formation of edema fluid than cortical
grey matter; secondly, subcortical white matter might be

Page 13 of 16

simply serving as a sink for edema fluid generated elsewhere [70]. Notably, given that the relative volume of
white matter to total brain volume is lower in rodents
compared with humans [71], these data cannot be directly extrapolated to human stroke.
While the data contained in the present study do not
establish a causal link between the described molecular
and morphological changes, it is likely that these phenomena are connected. The changes in Aqp4 subcellular
localization observed in cortical grey matter astrocytes
have been linked with reduced edema formation: Loss of
Aqp4 polarization has been speculated to protect against
edema formation [35], as mice that lack Aqp4 scaffolding proteins exhibit minimal perivascular Aqp4 and are
protected against brain swelling [35, 37, 44, 45]. Thus,
we postulate that the reduction of Aqp4 polarization observed to occur in cortical astrocytes partially protected
the ischemic cortex from local formation of cerebral
edema. In contrast, the changes in Aqp4 expression and
subcellular localization observed in subcortical white
matter astrocytes, namely, Aqp4 upregulation and
greater Aqp4 polarization, are associated with worsened
cytotoxic edema, greater local formation of ionic edema
and more severe brain swelling [28, 30]. Thus, we postulate that upregulation of Aqp4 expression in subcortical
white matter astrocytes, coupled with increased Aqp4
expression at the perivascular endfeet of subcortical
white matter astrocytes, facilitated local formation of
cerebral edema and hence worsened tissue swelling in
the subcortical white matter. With regards to future
work, while causality might be established indirectly
through a detailed temporal analysis of Aqp4 expression
and swelling, perhaps in the 4.5 hour ischemia rat
MCAO model, direct evidence for causality requires the
development of techniques that might allow for the selective manipulation of Aqp4 expression in white matter
astrocytes.
Overall, this study raises the intriguing possibility that
white matter may play a heretofore underappreciated active role in the formation of cerebral edema following ischemia. Previously, it was assumed that cerebral edema
formation occurs mostly in grey matter due to its relatively high vascular density [11]; in contrast, white matter was thought to serve as a mere sink [72] and/or
conduit [70, 73] for the accumulation or spread of cerebral edema. However, our findings suggest that, following ischemia, white matter astrocytes exhibit unique
molecular changes that may directly facilitate local formation of cerebral edema.
The present study has potential limitations. Firstly, our
experimental group underwent surgery under ketamine
anesthesia, whereas our controls did not have anesthesia.
Certain anesthetic agents can influence Aqp4
localization [74] and vascular tone [75]. However, in the

Stokum et al. Acta Neuropathologica Communications (2015) 3:61

present study, ketamine has been shown not to influence
Aqp4 expression in rats. Furthermore, in a previous
study, ketamine was shown not to influence Aqp4 expression or edema formation in rats submitted to
MCAO [76]. Secondly, given that a direct marker of
astrocyte viability was not included, it is possible that
astrocyte cell death underlies some of the reported
changes in Aqp4 immunoreactivity in the ischemic penumbra. However, this is unlikely since penumbral astrocytes exhibited preserved GFAP immunoreactivity,
which correlates strongly with viability [77].
The ischemic threshold for white matter (~20 ml∙100 g1
∙min−1) is lower than that for grey matter (~35 ml∙100 g
−1
∙min−1) [78], a difference that might have resulted in the
TUNEL-positive ipsilateral cortex and striatum, but
TUNEL-negative ipsilateral subcortical white matter observed in the rat MCAO model (Fig. 3b). Thus, we sought
to confirm that the rat white matter examined in the
present study was ischemic and damaged. As the commonly used TTC staining technique is not appropriate for
identification of ischemic white matter, we utilized an alternative method, silver infarct staining, where the staining intensity is proportional to tissue perfusion [54]. We
found that, in rats submitted to MCAO, silver staining
was reduced by approximately 30 % in both ipsilateral
white matter and grey matter. These findings, which are
consistent with past work demonstrating that white matter is highly sensitive to ischemia [79], indicate that the
subcortical white matter was indeed submitted to ischemic injury, although it remained viable, analogous to the
cortical penumbra.
Following acute CNS injury, astrocytes transition into
a so-called “reactive” phenotype characterized by altered
gene expression, morphology, and cytokine secretion [80].
While cerebral white and grey matter astrocytes are known
to exhibit developmental [13, 14], molecular [16, 17], and
physiological [21, 22] differences, prior to the present study,
it was unknown if their reactive phenotypes exhibit molecular differences. If the results of the present study, which
examined a single protein, extend to other astrocytic proteins, white matter and grey matter astrocyte subtypes may
engage fundamentally different programs of reactivity following injury. Given the proportionally large volume of
white matter in the human brain [23], this concept could
have important implications for a number of astrocytemediated phenomena in the injured brain.

Conclusions
In summary, we report that unlike cortical grey matter astrocytes, which exhibit decreased perivascular Aqp4 and
unchanged Aqp4 abundance following ischemia, subcortical white matter astrocytes exhibit greatly increased
perivascular Aqp4, plasmalemmal Aqp4, and Aqp4 abundance; this molecular heterogeneity may underlie the

Page 14 of 16

relatively greater propensity for tissue swelling exhibited
by subcortical white matter. Our findings may have important implications for the formation of cerebral edema
and brain swelling following cerebral ischemic injury.
