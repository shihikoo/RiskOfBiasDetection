Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are known to prevent ischemic brain damage after stroke. Natriuretic peptides, which are increased by a neprilysin inhibitor, are also reported to protect against brain
damage. Therefore, we investigated the possible protective effect of valsartan (VAL) compared with
LCZ696 (VALþ neprilysin inhibitor; 1:1) after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Eight-week-old
male C57BL/6J mice were treated with VAL (3 mg/kg per day) or LCZ696 (6 mg/kg per day) for 2 weeks
before MCA occlusion. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured by telemetry. Cerebral blood ﬂow
(CBF) was determined by laser-Doppler ﬂowmetry. Ischemic area was evaluated by triphenytetrasodium
chloride staining, and oxidative stress was determined by dihydroethidium staining. Blood pressure and
heart rate were not signiﬁcantly different before and after treatment. Pre-treatment with LCZ696 or VAL
reduced the ischemic area, and this effect of LCZ696 was more marked than that of VAL pre-treatment.
The decrease in CBF in the peripheral region of the ischemic area was signiﬁcantly attenuated by pretreatment with LCZ696 or VAL, without any signiﬁcant effect on CBF in the core region. VAL or LCZ696
pre-treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the increase of superoxide anion production in the cortex on the
ischemic side. However, no signiﬁcant difference in CBF and superoxide anion production was observed
between VAL and LCZ696 pre-treatment. The preventive effect of LCZ696 on ischemic brain damage after
stroke was more marked than that of VAL. LCZ696 could be used as a new approach to prevent brain
damage after stroke. (246 words)

1. Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death in the
industrialized world, and post-stroke disabilities markedly impair
quality of life. The renin angiotensin system is well known to play
a role in the pathogenesis of ischemic brain damage, and has been
evaluated in various studies such as in mouse models of brain
infarction induced by middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (Iwai
et al., 2004; Saavedra et al., 2006; Walther et al., 2002). Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers (ARBs) were shown to attenuate ischemic brain damage in these studies. Regarding the
clinical relevance of the protective effects of ARBs against brain
damage after stroke, Fuentes et al. reported that patients taking
antihypertensive drugs at stroke onset had a lower rate of a poor

outcome than those not on antihypertensive treatment, and those
taking an ARB had better outcomes than those without an ARB,
while analysis of other antihypertensive drugs showed no difference (Fuentes et al., 2010).
Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) has been investigated as a potential novel therapeutic target, because of its
ability to increase the plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides (NPs), since NPs have potent natriuretic and vasodilator
properties, inhibit the activity of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, lower sympathetic drive, and exert antiproliferative
and antihypertrophic effects (Mangiaﬁco et al., 2013). LCZ696 is a
novel single molecule in which the molecular moieties of valsartan
and the molecular moieties of an NEP inhibitor prodrug, AHU377,
are present in a 1:1 M ratio (Gu et al., 2010). LCZ696 provides a
complementary and fully additive reduction of BP compared with
valsartan (Ruilope et al., 2010). In heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction, LCZ696 reduced NT-proBNP to a greater
degree than did valsartan alone, and LCZ696 showed beneﬁcial

effects on symptoms independent of its BP-lowering effect (Solomon
et al., 2012), suggesting that LCZ696 leads to cardiovascular beneﬁts
over and above the effect on BP lowering (Bloch and Basile, 2010).
In the acute phase of ischemic stroke, NP level is frequently
elevated and has been shown to be an independent predictor of
mortality (Estrada et al., 1994; Iltumur et al., 2006; Nakagawa
et al., 2005). These results suggest that NPs could play a role in the
prevention of ischemic brain damage at least in part due to hemodynamic regulation during the acute phase of stroke. Accordingly, we tried to explore the beneﬁcial effects of LCZ696 on focal
brain ischemia induced by MCA occlusion in mice and its possible
mechanisms in comparison with valsartan.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and treatment
All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Animal
Studies Committee of Ehime University. An ARB, valsartan (VAL),
was purchased from LKT Laboratories, Inc. (St. Paul, MN). LCZ696
was provided by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland). Mice
were treated with VAL (3 mg/kg per day) or LCZ696 (6 mg/kg per
day) orally as powder in gelatin mini-capsules (Torpac, Inc., Fairﬁeld, NJ) daily for 2 weeks before MCA occlusion. Body weight was
measured after VAL or LCZ696 pre-treatment for 2 weeks. Systolic
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were
measured by telemetry at 10 weeks of age as described previously
(Iwanami et al., 2014).

Atto, Tokyo, Japan).
2.6. Brain water content
Brain water content was measured by the wet/dry weight
method as described previously (Iwanami et al., 2008). Brains
were weighed and then oven-dried at 100 °C for 24 h and reweighed. Brain water content (%) was calculated as (wet weight–
dry weight)/wet weight  100.
2.7. Analysis of serum samples
Serum samples were prepared from mice after VAL or LCZ696
pre-treatment for 2 weeks. Serum Na þ concentration was determined by DRI-CHEM 7000V (Fujiﬁlm Co., Tokyo, Japan). Serum
atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels were measured by ELISA,
according to the protocol of manufactures (RayBiotech, Inc., Norcross, GA). Angiotensin II (Ang II) levels were determined by ELISA,
according to the instruction of manufacturer (Enzo Life Sciences
Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Renin activity was determined by ﬂuorimetric assay kit (ANASPEC Inc, Fremont, CA). Results were quantiﬁed by relative ﬂuorescence unit.
2.8. Statistical analysis
All values are expressed as mean 7 S.E.M. in the text and ﬁgures. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance. If a statistically
signiﬁcant effect was found, Tukey–kramer post hoc analysis was
performed for multiple comparisons. A difference with P o0.05
was considered signiﬁcant.

2.2. MCA occlusion model
Adult male 8 week-old C57BL/6J (CLEA, Tokyo, Japan) were
used in this study. Permanent focal cerebral ischemia was induced
by occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery using a modiﬁed
intraluminal ﬁlament technique as described previously (Hata
et al., 1998; Maeda et al., 1999). Brain samples were obtained 24 h
after MCA occlusion.
2.3. Cerebral blood ﬂow
After 2 weeks of drug treatment, cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) was
determined by laser speckle ﬂowmetry (Omegazone, laser speckle
blood ﬂow imager, Omegawave, Tokyo, Japan), which obtains
high-resolution 2D images in a matter of seconds as previously
described (Tsukuda et al., 2008).

3. Results
3.1. Focal ischemic injury of brain after MCA occlusion
Focal brain ischemia was induced by MCA occlusion using the
intraluminal ﬁlament technique. VAL (3 mg/kg/day) or LCZ696
(6 mg/kg/day) was administered for 2 weeks before MCA occlusion. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart
rate were not signiﬁcantly different in each group (Fig. 1). Pretreatment with VAL or LCZ attenuated the ischemic area, and
quantitative analysis of the average ischemic ratio showed a signiﬁcant reduction of approximately 41% and 55% in the VAL and
LCZ696 groups compared with control group (Fig. 2). LCZ696 pretreatment was more effective than VAL pre-treatment to reduce
the ischemic area (P o0.05).

2.4. Triphenyltetrasodium chloride staining
3.2. Cerebral blood ﬂow after MCA occlusion
To evaluate the ischemic area in the brain, the extracted brain
was sliced into seven coronal sections with 1 mm thickness and
stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrasodium chloride (TTC). Ischemic area was determined as the percentage of TTC-unstained
area in the total area as previously described (Bederson et al.,
1986; Hata et al., 1998).
2.5. Dihydroethidium staining
Detection of superoxide anion was carried out as described
previously (Jinno et al., 2004; Szocs et al., 2002). Superoxide anion
production in regions of interest has been described previously
(Mogi et al., 2006). Red ﬂuorescence of ethidium in the specimen
was detected using an Axioskop microscope (Axioskop 2 Plus with
AxioCam, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a
computer-based imaging system. The ﬂuorescence intensity was
analyzed and quantiﬁed using imaging software (Densitograph,

Cerebral surface blood ﬂow was measured in the core region
and peripheral region of the ischemic area. CBF decreased just
after MCA occlusion to approximately 30% of the basal level in the
core region and to approximately 50% in the peripheral region of
control mice (Fig. 3). This reduction of CBF continued for at least
24 h after MCA occlusion. VAL or LCZ96 pre-treatment did not
inﬂuence CBF in the core region. However, CBF in the peripheral
region was signiﬁcantly increased by VAL or LCZ696 pre-treatment, without a signiﬁcant difference between their effects.
3.3. Oxidative stress in brain after MCA occlusion
To assess the involvement of oxidative stress in focal brain
ischemia, superoxide anion production in the brain cortex 24 h
after MCA occlusion was evaluated by DHE staining (Fig. 4). We
observed that superoxide anion production was enhanced on the

We next evaluated brain edema 24 h after MCA occlusion with
the wet/dry method (Fig. 5). In sham operated mice, brain water
content was approximately 78%. Brain water content after MCA
occlusion in control group was signiﬁcantly increased compared
with sham group. Moreover, LCZ696 pre-treated mice showed
signiﬁcantly attenuated water content compared with control

4. Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that both valsartan and
LCZ696 pre-treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the ischemic area
after stroke, at least in part by increasing CBF in the penumbra and
inhibiting oxidative stress. Moreover, we observed that LCZ696
pre-treatment was more effective than VAL pre-treatment in reducing the ischemic area, independent of BP.
In spite of their apparent similar effects to increase CBF and
decrease superoxide anion production after stroke, LCZ696 was

more effective in decreasing the ischemic area after MCA occlusion. Mice were treated with valsartan (3 mg/kg per day) or
LCZ696 (6 mg/kg per day), suggesting that the plasma concentration of valsartan would be similar with both, since LCZ696 contains the molecular moieties of valsartan and the NEP inhibitor
prodrug, AHU377, at a 1:1 M ratio.
Neprilysin inhibition increases the plasma concentrations of
natriuretic peptides (NPs) by blocking their degradation. NP receptor activation increases intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP), which
in turn mediates biologic effects such as vasodilatation, natriuresis

of cardiovascular diseases may potentially be augmented by enhancement of NP activity (Burnett, 1999; Laurent et al., 2012).
However, AT1 receptor blockade and NEP inhibition increase angiotensin II and decrease angiotensin-(1–7) levels, which could
counteract some beneﬁcial effects of LCZ696 associated with NPs
(Campbell, 2003). Angiotensin-(1–7) is known to increase CBF and
attenuate oxidative stress and inﬂammation in the brain (Sumners
et al., 2013). Therefore, we speculate that administration of LCZ696
did not cause additional effects on CBF and oxidative stress compared to valsartan in this experiment, and that direct neuroprotective effects of NPs could contribute to the difference in the
decrease of ischemic area between valsartan and LCZ696.
There are several limitations in this set of experiment. We used
10 week-old young and normotensive mice for MCA occlusion
model. Cerebral ischemia usually occurs in the elderly people and
hypertensive patients is one of the most popular causes in stroke.
Therefore, aged and/or hypertensive mice seems to be appropriate
for the model of stroke. In clinical relevance, further investigation
are necessary to examine the effects of LCZ 696 on stroke using
such mice to reﬂect the typical stroke population.
The present study demonstrated that the effect of LCZ696 to
protect against ischemic brain damage was more prominent than
that of valsartan alone, at least partly because of the effect of NPs.
Our results provide evidence of prevention of ischemic brain damage after stroke by LCZ696, and that LCZ696 pre-treatment could
be a novel approach to prevent cerebral ischemic injury.

and diuresis, and inhibition of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone
system (RAAS) (Potter et al., 2006; Rubattu et al., 2008). NPs act
directly on the central nervous system to inhibit water and sodium
accumulation in ischemic brain edema (Nakao et al., 1990). Our
results also showed a beneﬁcial effect of LCZ696 pre-treatment on
brain edema more than VAL. Moreover, cGMP has been shown to
be a neuroprotective mediator. The ability of cGMP to lower intracellular Ca2 þ may be of particular importance during ischemia,
since ischemic activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate and metabotropic glutamate receptors allows Ca2 þ inﬂux and overload, which
is thought to be the major factor initiating ischemic cell death
(Dirnagl et al., 1999). Thus, NPs are able to increase the tissue
potential for cGMP signaling, which may contribute to neuroprotection against subsequent ischemic challenge after stroke. In
contrast, a neprilysin inhibitor, candoxatril is reported to increase
not only plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) concentrations but
also plasma angiotensin II, aldosterone and catecholamine concentrations (Richards et al., 1993). In this study, we have not
analyzed the effect of a neprilysin inhibitor alone because we
would like to assess the additional effect of a neprilysin inhibitor
on stroke compared with VAL pre-treatment. On the other hand, in
human pharmacokinetic studies, there was no signiﬁcant difference in disappearance curve after peak plasma concentration between VAL (320 mg) and LCZ696 (400 mg) (Gu et al., 2010);
therefore, we hope that a neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril, may not
affect valsartan metabolism in this mouse model.
