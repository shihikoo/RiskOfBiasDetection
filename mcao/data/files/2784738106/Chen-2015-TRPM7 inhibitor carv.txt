Abstract
Background: Our previous study found that suppression of TRPM7 reduced neuronal death in adult rat ischemic
brain injury. It was reported that carvacrol blocked TRPM7 and attenuated brain injury in an adult rat MCAO model.
The effects of carvacrol on neonatal stroke remain unknown. This study investigated the effects of carvacrol on
neuronal injury and behavioral impairment after hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal mice and the potential signaling
pathway underlying these effects.
Results: Carvacrol inhibited TRPM7 current in HEK293 cells over-expressing TRPM7 and TRPM7-like current in
hippocampal neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Carvacrol (>200 μM) reduced OGD-induced neuronal injury
in cortical neurons. 24 hours after HI, TRPM7 protein level in the ipsilateral hemisphere was significantly higher
than in the contralateral hemisphere. Carvacrol (30 and 50 mg/kg) pre-treatment reduced brain infarct volume 24 hours
after HI in a dose-dependent manner. Carvacrol pre-treatment also improved neurobehavioral outcomes. Furthermore,
animals pre-treated with carvacrol had fewer TUNEL-positive cells in the brain compared to vehicle-treated animals
3 days after HI. Carvacrol pre-treatment also increased Bcl-2/Bax and p-Akt/t-Akt protein ratios and decreased cleaved
caspase-3 protein expression 24 hours after HI.
Conclusions: Carvacrol pre-treatment protects against neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury by reducing brain infarct
volume, promoting pro-survival signaling and inhibiting pro-apoptotic signaling, as well as improving behavioral
outcomes. The neuroprotective effect may be mediated by the inhibition of TRPM7 channel function. Carvacrol is a
potential drug development target for the treatment of neonatal stroke.

Background
Hypoxic-ischemic injury or stroke in mammalian brains
elicits delayed neuronal death (DND) [1]. Previous studies
have considered glutamate excitotoxicity as a key mechanism in stroke [2]. However, the inhibition of glutamate signaling has not been sufficiently neuroprotective in clinical
trials [3]. Recently, non-glutamate mechanisms have
attracted more attention in stroke research. Nonglutamate mechanisms also lead to intracellular ionic

imbalance and neuronal cell death in ischemia and stroke
[4]. TRPM7 is an important non-glutamate mechanism
and thus a potential target for drug development against
ischemic brain injury [4].
Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) belongs to the melastatin-related subfamily of TRP channels and is ubiquitously expressed in almost all tissues,
including brain [5]. TRPM7 is a Ca2+-permeable, nonselective cation channel that has recently gained attention
as a potential cation influx pathway involved in ischemic
neuronal injury. An earlier study has demonstrated that
TRPM7 is a key mediator of anoxic neuronal death [6,7].
Subsequent reports have revealed that TRPM7 mRNA
and protein expression increase in the brain after cerebral
ischemic injury and in hippocampal neurons subjected to

oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) [7-10]. Moreover, it is
found that Lactuside B and Ginsenoside-Rd protect
against cerebral ischemic damage, at least in part by decreasing TRPM7 expression. In vivo study has shown that
TRPM7 suppression by virally mediated gene silencing
prevents delayed neuronal cell death and promotes neurobehavioral functional recovery in a rat global cerebral
ischemia model [11]. Hence, TRPM7 seems to be a promising potential therapeutic target for drug development for
stroke.
Carvacrol, a pungent natural compound often used as
a food additive, has been reported to block TRPM7
current in HEK cells over-expressing TRPM7 and in hippocampal neurons [12], as well as provide neuroprotection in adult mice subjected to focal ischemia [13].
Carvacrol is therefore a potential pharmacological tool
for studying the functions of TRPM7 channels in vitro
and in vivo.
Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury (also
known as neonatal stroke) and its related brain disorders
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and cerebral
palsy, are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children, with a reported incidence of 2–9 per
1000 births [14]. Approximately 20–50% of infants that
have suffered HI will die and up to 25% will suffer permanent brain damage [14]. It causes severe neurological
disorders and lifelong disability in survivors, including
cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and epilepsy [15].
Currently, there are no effective pharmacological interventions available for protecting neonatal brains after HI
injury. The effect of carvacrol in neonatal stroke has not
yet been studied. Here we report the neuroprotective effects of carvacrol in mouse neonatal hypoxic-ischemic
brain injury.

Results
Carvacrol inhibits TRPM7 currents in HEK293 cells and
hippocampal neurons

First, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp experiments
to examine the effect of carvacrol on TRPM7 current in
HEK293 cells over-expressing TRPM7 and on TRPM7-like
native currents in mouse hippocampal neurons. Carvacrol
inhibited TRPM7 current in HEK293 cells over-expressing
TRPM7 (Figure 1A, n = 6 cells) and TRPM7-like currents
in mouse primary hippocampal neurons (Figure 1B, n = 6
cells) in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, carvacrol is a
valid pharmacological tool for further in vitro and in vivo
studies.
Carvacrol protects neurons from OGD-induced cell injury
in vitro

We next tested whether carvacrol can protect neurons
from anoxic insult (oxygen and glucose deprivation: OGD)
in vitro. Propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence intensity in

Page 2 of 13

cortical neurons was significantly greater following OGD.
We showed that carvacrol pre-incubation for 30 minutes
significantly reduced PI fluorescence intensity in a dosedependent manner (200-800 μM concentration) compared
to that of vehicle-treat group. The PI fluorescence intensity
was reduced by 28.74% at 200 μM, 54.43% at 500 μM and
48.59% at 800 μM carvacrol (Figure 1C, p < 0.05 for all
three doses, n = 5). This result was further confirmed by
double-staining with PI and neuronal nuclei (NeuN) antibody to evaluate the percentage of PI positive cells. As
shown in Figure 1D and E, the percentage of PI positive
cells was 12.7 ± 1.5% in the control group, and this increased significantly to 40.1 ± 3.1% in the OGD group
(*, p < 0.05, n = 4), but was significantly less with 24.7 ±
2.8% in the carvacrol pre-treatment group (300 μM, #,
p < 0.05, n = 4). This in vitro data indicates that carvacrol is able to protect cultured neurons from anoxic
insult.
Carvacrol pre-treatment attenuates infarct volume of
hypoxic-ischemic injury in vivo in a dose-dependent
manner

Next, we asked whether carvacrol can reduce brain damage in vivo using a mouse neonatal hypoxic-ischemic
brain injury model. We observed that carvacrol pretreatment (30 and 50 mg/kg i.p., 30 min before HI) significantly reduced infarct volume 24 hours after HI.
TTC staining of coronal sections of mouse brains was
used for evaluating the infarct volume. Representative
images of TTC staining were shown in Figure 2A, where
white areas indicated brain damage. There was no detectable infarction in the sham group (data not shown). Infarct
volume in the vehicle-treated HI group (Vehicle) was
57.83 ± 5.18% (n = 24 pups). Carvacrol pre-treatment (30
and 50 mg/kg) significantly reduced the infarct volume to
31.11 ± 7.63% (n = 11 pups) and 6.18 ± 3.73% (n = 17
pups), respectively, compared to the vehicle-treated group
(*, p < 0.05). The reduction of infarct volume was dosedependent (#, p < 0.05) (Figure 2A). Furthermore, 7 days
after HI, whole brains were fixed, imaged, and then sectioned for Nissl staining. Carvacrol pre-treatment (50 mg/
kg) also resulted in significantly less brain damage (both in
whole brains and coronal sections, n = 15 pups) 7 days
after HI (Figure 2B) compared to vehicle treatment (with
larger brain tissue loss, n = 12 pups). Brain imaging at
7 days further supported TTC staining at one day with respect to the neuroprotective effects of carvacrol in HI.
Carvacrol pre-treatment improves neurobehavioral
performance after HI

We further evaluated neurobehavioral outcomes in sham
(n = 7 pups), carvacrol-treated (n = 15 pups) and vehicletreated animals (n = 12 pups). Neurobehavioral tests
evaluating the geotaxis reflex, cliff avoidance and grip

Figure 1 Carvacrol (CAR) inhibits TRPM7 and TRPM7-like currents and protects cortical neurons from OGD-induced injury. A, HEK293
cells over-expressing TRPM7 were induced by tetracycline (1 μM) for 24 hours. TRPM7 current was recorded as described in methods section.
Representative I-V curves are shown. Perfusion with carvacrol (500 μM and 1 mM) caused a dramatic decrease in the TRPM7 current in dosedependent manner (n = 6 cells). B, TRPM7-like current in primary hippocampal neurons (HPC) was recorded as described in methods section.
Perfusion with carvacrol (500 μM and 1 mM) dose-dependently blocked TRPM7-like current in HPC. Representative I-V curves are shown (n = 6
cells). C, cortical neurons were incubated with carvacrol or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 30 min and then treated with OGD for 1 hour and transferred
to regular medium for 24 hours. Cells were then stained with PI and the fluorescent intensity was measured using Synergy HT Multi-Mode Micro plate
Reader. Results demonstrated that carvacrol (200-800 μM) significantly protected neurons from OGD-induced injury (*, p < 0.05 compared with vehicle
treated group, n = 5, One-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test). D and E, cortical neurons were treated with carvacrol (300 μM) for 30 min, and
then OGD and PI staining were conducted as described above. Representative images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 710 Confocal Microscope. Scale

Figure 2 Carvacrol (CAR) pre-treatment reduced infarct volume of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in a dose-dependent manner.
A, TTC staining was performed as described in methods section. The representative images of TTC-stained coronal brain slices are shown (Left
panel). Infarct volume is smaller in carvacrol pre-treatment group than vehicle group (*, p < 0.05 compared with vehicle group. #, p < 0.05
compared with carvacrol 30 mg/kg group, One-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test). B, representative images of whole brain and Nissl

were performed 1, 3, and 7 days after HI in the three
groups. Compared with pups in the sham group, neurobehavioral functions of pups in the vehicle-treated HI
group were significantly impaired 1, 3 and 7 days after
HI (Figure 3, *, p < 0.05). Geotaxis test performance was
significantly better in the carvacrol-treated group 7 days
after HI (Figure 3A) compared to the vehicle-treated
group (3.11 ± 0.53 s in carvacrol-treated HI group versus
4.89 ± 0.67 s in the vehicle-treated HI group; p < 0.05).
Cliff avoidance test performance was also significantly
better in the carvacrol-treated group 3 and 7 days after
HI (Figure 3B) compared to the vehicle-treated group
(1.48 ± 0.14 s in the carvacrol-treated group versus
1.90 ± 0.13 s in the vehicle-treated group 3 days after
HI; 1.42 ± 0.13 s in the carvacrol-treated group versus
2.01 ± 0.23 s in the vehicle-treated group 7 days after
HI; p < 0.05). Grip test performance was also significantly better 1, 3 and 7 days after HI in the carvacroltreated group compared to the vehicle-treated group
(Figure 3C) (p < 0.05). Therefore, carvacrol not only reduced brain damage but also improved behavioral outcomes after HI challenge.

TRPM7 protein expression increases in the HI mouse
brain

We also determined whether TRPM7 expression in the
brain changes after HI. Western blotting experiments
were carried out to compare TRPM7 protein expression
between the ipsilateral and contralateral brain hemispheres 24 hours after HI. We showed that TRPM7 protein expression level was approximately 5-fold higher in
the ipsilateral hemisphere than in the contralateral
hemisphere (ipsilateral: 0.42 ± 0.065 arbitrary units
(AUs) versus contralateral: 0.077 ± 0.047 AUs; p < 0.05,
n = 4) (Figure 4A). This indicates that the TRPM7 channel may be involved in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain
injury.
Carvacrol pre-treatment protects brain tissue in HI model
from apoptosis

Apoptosis is involved in neonatal HI-induced neuronal
death, which may take time to develop [16,17]. It is more
common in the immature brain than in the adult brain
[18]. Preventing or reducing apoptosis is a therapeutic
strategy for neonatal stroke. We examined whether the

Figure 3 Carvacrol pretreatment improves neurobehavioral performance after cerebral HI. Neurobehavioral evaluation was performed as
described in Material and Methods. Geotaxis reflex (A), cliff avoidance test (B) and grip test (C) of sham (n = 7), vehicle group (HI + vehicle, n = 12)
and carvacrol (50 mg/kg) pretreatment group (HI + CAR, n = 15) were measured 1 day, 3 days and 7 days after HI (*, p < 0.05 versus sham group;
#, p < 0.05 versus vehicle group, One-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test).

protective effect of carvacrol is associated with the reduction of apoptosis using a TUNEL assay and western blot
(cleaved caspase-3, see below). The number of TUNELpositive cells in the vehicle-treated HI group increased significantly with respect to the sham group (146.33 ± 16.06
cells in the vehicle-treated group versus 1.67 ± 0.33 cells
in the sham group; p < 0.05, n = 3) (Figure 4B and C).
Carvacrol (50 mg/kg) pre-treatment significantly decreased TUNEL-positive cell counts compared to the
vehicle-treated HI group (reduced to 15.00 ± 1.46 cells,
p < 0.05, n = 3). Immunofluorescence showed that overexpression of TRPM7 (blue) was accompanied by increasing expression of cleaved caspase-3 (red) in penumbra of
the ipsilateral hemisphere, when compared to a similar region on the contralateral hemisphere of the HI mouse
(Figure 5). Anti-NeuN antibody was used to label surviving neurons and it showed that there were more degenerating cells and fewer surviving cells in the penumbra of
ipsilateral hemisphere compared with a similar region on
contralateral side, which shows normal neuron morphology and mostly surviving cells. These results indicate
that apoptotic cells in the penumbra of the ipsilateral
hemisphere express higher levels of TRPM7 protein, and
inhibition of TRPM7 by carvacrol protects cells from

apoptosis in neonatal brains of HI mice. Next we investigated if this reduction of TUNEL-positive cells is mediated
by any known apoptotic signals.
Carvacrol pre-treatment increases Bcl-2/Bax protein ratio
and reduces caspase-3 cleavage

TUNEL results indicate that carvacrol may reduce apoptosis in neonatal HI brain injury. We further determined
which apoptosis-related proteins may be involved in this
effect. Caspase-3 cleavage has been reported as a major
cause of brain injury after neonatal stroke [19]. Bcl-2/
Bax protein ratio is important in the mitochondrial
apoptosis pathway [20]. Bcl-2 and Bax protein levels play
a key role in brain injury in the neonatal HI model
[21,22]. In accordance with other studies [13,19], we
found that cleaved caspase-3 protein expression was significantly greater 24 hours after HI (normalized to
β-actin, 1.03 ± 0.08 AUs in the vehicle-treated HI group
versus 0.088 ± 0.003 AUs in the sham group; p < 0.05,
n = 3) (Figure 6A and C). Carvacrol pre-treatment significantly reduced cleaved caspase-3 levels to 0.75 ±
0.04 AUs (p < 0.05 when compared to the vehicle-treated
group, n = 3). We also found that the protein ratio of Bcl2/Bax was significantly lower in the vehicle-treated group

TRPM7 protein expression in the injured hemisphere (ipsilateral) and uninjured contralateral hemisphere 24 hours after HI. TRPM7 protein expression
level is higher in injured hemisphere than the contralateral hemisphere (*, p < 0.05, n = 4). B, TUNEL staining was carried out 3 days after HI and images
were viewed using fluorescence microscopy. Left panel shows the representative images of TUNEL staining. Red fluorescence in TUNEL-positive cells
indicates apoptosis. Blue fluorescence is DAPI staining for nucleus. Scale bar represents 10 μm. Right panel shows the mouse brain coronal sections.
C, Quantitative analysis of TUNEL-positive cells showed that pre-treatment with carvacrol (50 mg/kg) reduced the number of TUNEL positive cells
(*, p < 0.05 compared with sham group. #, p < 0.05 compared with vehicle group, n = 3, One-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test).

compared to the sham group (0.038 ± 0.002 AUs in
vehicle-treated group versus 0.067 ± 0.006 AUs in sham
group; p < 0.05, n = 3) (Figure 6A and B); while carvacrol
pre-treatment (50 mg/kg) restored Bcl-2/Bax ratio to
0.055 ± 0.004 AUs (p < 0.05 to vehicle-treated group, n = 3).
Therefore, carvacrol is able to inhibit pro-apoptotic signaling pathways in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.
Next, the effects of carvacrol on Bcl-2/Bax ratio were measured in an OGD-induced cortical neuron injury model.
As shown in Figure 6E and F, cortical neurons exposed to
OGD had a lower Bcl-2/Bax ratio, while the Bcl-2/Bax ratio increased in the carvacrol (300 μM) pre-treatment
group (*, #, p < 0.05, n = 4).
Carvacrol pre-treatment increases phosphorylated Akt
(p-Akt) level after HI brain injury

Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is a protective signaling pathway involved in neuroprotection in stroke
[23]. Carvacrol has been reported to increase Akt phosphorylation in a focal ischemia model [13]. In this study,
we found that p-Akt/t-Akt was significantly lower in the

vehicle-treated HI group (0.26 ± 0.02 AUs in the vehicletreated group versus 0.53 ± 0.02 AUs in sham group; p <
0.05, n = 3); while carvacrol pre-treatment restored the
p-Akt/t-Akt ratio to 0.50 ± 0.1 AU (p < 0.05 with respect
to the vehicle-treated group, n = 3) (Figure 6A and D).
Therefore, carvacrol is able to promote pro-survival signaling in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.

Discussion
In this study, we show that: 1) carvacrol inhibits TRPM7
and TRPM7-like currents in TRPM7 over-expressing
HEK293 cells and mouse hippocampal neurons, respectively; 2) TRPM7 protein expression in the brain increases 24 hours after HI; 3) pre-treatment with the
TRPM7 channel blocker carvacrol is neuroprotective
and improves behavioral outcomes in a mouse model of
neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury; 4) carvacrol inhibits pro-apoptotic signals in HI by increasing Bcl-2/
Bax protein ratio and reducing caspase-3 activation; and
5) carvacrol promotes pro-survival signals in HI by restoring the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. These findings

suggest that carvacrol has therapeutic potential in preventing and treating neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain
injury.
First, we employed whole-cell patch clamp to confirm
that carvacrol inhibited TRPM7 current in HEK293 cells
over-expressing TRPM7 and in cultured hippocampal
neurons (Figure 1). Our results show that carvacrol inhibits TRPM7 currents in HEK293 cells and TRPM7like currents in cultured neurons in a dose-dependent
manner. This is consistent with other studies [12]. Next,
we detected neuroprotective effects of carvacrol in vitro
using an OGD model in cultured neurons. We showed
that carvacrol inhibits OGD-induced neuronal cell death
in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. As OGD is a wellaccepted in vitro hypoxia-ischemia cell model for drug
testing [24], our findings indicated that carvacrol may
also protect neurons from hypoxia-ischemia brain injury

in vivo. Hence, we further evaluated the effects of carvacrol in vivo using a neonatal stroke model of HI.
The neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury model
used in this study was adapted from the method described by Rice et al. [25], with minor modifications. It is
a widely used neonatal stroke model, and has been
employed to explore drug intervention targets for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury [26,27]. We have
established this HI model to study the neuroprotective
effects of a volume-regulated anion channel blocker [28]
and hypoxic preconditioning [29]. In addition to the
OGD in vitro model, we also evaluated the effects of carvacrol in an in vivo neonatal stroke model.
Upregulation of TRPM7 protein levels has been reported to occur 20 and 24 hours after MCAO and
ischemia-reperfusion in adult rats [7,9]. However, brain

(26 kDa), Bax (20 kDa), cleaved caspase-3 (19/17 kDa), p-Akt (Ser 473, 60 kDa) and t-Akt (60 kDa) protein expression. β-actin (42 kDa) was used as
a loading control. Carvacrol (50 mg/kg) pretreatment increased the protein ratio of Bcl-2/Bax (B), decreased cleaved caspase-3 protein expression
(C) and increased p-Akt/t-Akt protein ratio (D) 24 hours after HI (*, p < 0.05 versus sham group; #, p < 0.05 versus vehicle group, n = 3, One-way
ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test). When primary mouse cortical neurons were exposed to OGD for 60 minutes and additional 18 hours in
normal culture medium, Bcl-2/Bax ratio in the OGD group was lower than that of the control group, and significantly increased in the Carvacrol
(300 μM) pre-treatment group (E and F, *, p < 0.05 versus the sham group; #, p < 0.05 versus the vehicle group, n = 3, One-way ANOVA followed
by Newman-Keuls test).

ischemic brain injury was previously unknown. Here we
compared TRPM7 protein expression between ipsilateral
and contralateral brain hemispheres from neonatal
mouse pups subjected to HI 24 hours prior. Upregulation of TRPM7 protein expression occurred in
apoptotic cells in ipsilateral brain tissue. This suggests
that TRPM7 is relevant to HI-induced brain injury and
can potentially serve as a therapeutic target for hypoxicischemic brain injury, the function of which can be modulated by carvacrol.
In this study, carvacrol was intraperitoneally injected
30 minutes before pups were subjected to hypoxicischemic injury. Carvacrol is a lipophilic compound with a
small molecular weight (mol wt, 150.22) [30]. Carvacrol
likely crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in neonatal
mice because administering carvacrol intraperitoneally at
2 h after reperfusion showed the neuroprotective effects
on brain injury in an adult mouse MCAO model [13]. The
BBB of newborns is considered to be more permeable
than that of adults for certain compounds [31]. Furthermore, increased BBB permeability often results from hypoxia–ischemia [32]. These factors, combined with the
physicochemical characteristics of carvacrol, suggest that
carvacrol crosses the BBB of HI mice. We showed that
carvacrol pre-treatment reduced brain damage 1 day after
HI as assessed by TTC stain and also 7 days after HI using
whole brain imaging and Nissl stain. The neuroprotective
effects of carvacrol are dose-dependent. Neonatal
hypoxic-ischemic brain injury leads to motor and cognitive deficits, and seizures [33]. Therefore, we also evaluated the neurobehavioral function of carvacrol-treated
mice compared to vehicle-treated HI and sham mice. Carvacrol improved behavioral outcomes in a battery of tests
including geotaxis reflex, cliff avoidance and grip tests.
Therefore, our results indicate that carvacrol not only reduced infarct volume, but also improved the return of
neurobehavioral function. It was reported that carvacrol
improved diabetes-related cognitive deficits in a Morris
water maze test in rats [34]. The effects of carvacrol on
HI-induced cognitive dysfunction remain unknown. Further experiments are required to evaluate its effects over
the long term.
Apoptosis is considered to be a key pathological trigger of delayed neuronal death following transient global
ischemia [16,17]. Apoptosis is more common in the immature brain than adult brain [18]. Our study detected
the apoptosis in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury
first using TUNEL assay followed by western blot for
apoptosis-related proteins. The number of TUNELpositive cells in the carvacrol-treated group was significantly lower than the number found in the vehicletreated group. This is consistent with other reports
showing anti-apoptotic effects of carvacrol in myocardial
cells [35]. The mitochondria-dependent pathway for

Page 9 of 13

apoptosis is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins,
each of which either promotes or prevents apoptosis.
Bcl-2 is involved in HI brain apoptosis [36]. The total
expression of Bcl-2 decreases 24 hours after neonatal HI
in vivo [36], while Bax expression increases. Enhancing
Bcl-2 or reducing Bax expression provides protection
from injury in neonatal HI brains [36-38]. The ratio of
Bcl-2/Bax protein affects mitochondrial membrane permeability and regulates mitochondrially-mediated apoptosis pathways. In our study, western blotting revealed
that the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax decreased in neonatal HI
pups. With carvacrol pre-treatment, the protein ratio of
Bcl-2/Bax was greater. In addition, carvacrol also inhibited an OGD-induced decrease in Bcl-2/Bax, suggesting
that Bcl-2/Bax ratio in the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway is involved in the anti-apoptotic effects
of carvacrol. It is reported that Bcl-2 reduction in neonatal HI can be prevented by the calpain inhibitor
CX295 [36]. M-calpain is an enzyme substrate of
TRPM7 [39]. It suggests that carvacrol blocks TRPM7
function partly by reducing its enzyme substrate, mcalpain, to restore Bcl-2 expression leading to prevention
of apoptosis in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.
Further research is required to reveal this mechanism.
Caspase-3, which is the protein downstream of mitochondrial and death receptors in the apoptotic signaling
pathway, has been identified as a key mediator of apoptosis in animal models of ischemic stroke [40]. Inhibition
of caspase-3 activation is an established therapeutic
strategy for neonatal HI brain injury [41,42]. In an adult
MCAO mouse model, it was reported that carvacrol treatment decreased cleaved caspase-3 protein level after cerebral ischemia injury [13]. We also found that cleaved
caspase-3 increased in HI pups 24 hours after hypoxiaischemia. Carvacrol pre-treatment significantly attenuated
the level of cleaved caspase-3. Hence, carvacrol effectively
prevents apoptosis in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, likely through the mitochondrial Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-3
signaling pathway.
Activation of PI3K/Akt, a critical pro-survival signaling
pathway, plays a protective role in cerebral ischemia injury [23]. It has been reported that the phosphorylation
level of Akt (p-Akt) is reduced 8 and 24 hours after HI
in rats [43]. In our study, p-Akt protein expression was
reduced 24 hours after HI, which is consistent with previous results [43]. Carvacrol pre-treatment significantly
restored p-Akt protein expression. Thus, the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway also contributes to the protective effects of carvacrol in neonatal stroke.
This study’s use of a pre-treatment paradigm provides
“Proof of Principle” for: 1) the involvement of a nonglutamatergic mechanism (TRPM7) in HI brain injury,
and 2) the idea that TRPM7 blockers (i.e. carvacrol) are
a promising target for drug development against HI-

Chen et al. Molecular Brain (2015) 8:11

induced brain injury. Clinically, acute ischemic stroke
patients are given therapies after symptom onset. It has
been reported that post-stroke treatment with carvacrol
also inhibited brain injury in an adult mouse model of
middle cerebral artery occlusion model, with a therapeutic window of up to 6 hours [13], suggesting that carvacrol has potential as a stroke treatment. Future study
will test different time courses- including posttreatment- for carvacrol in the neonatal mouse HI
model and evaluate its therapeutic widow for neonatal
stroke. In conclusion, carvacrol pre-treatment protects
brains from hypoxic-ischemic injury, improves neurobehavioral outcomes, promotes pro-survival and inhibits
pro-apoptosis signaling pathways in a mouse model of
neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Neuroprotection
is likely mediated by the inhibition of TRPM7 current
and the resultant up-regulation of Bcl-2/Bax and p-Akt
to decrease caspase-3 activation. Since carvacrol is considered a safe substance and is widely used as a food
additive [44,45], it can potentially be used as a bioactive
molecule for the prevention and treatment of neonatal
hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and its related brain
disorders.

Materials and methods
Animals

All protocols were carried out in accordance with Canadian
Council on Animal Care guidelines and approved by the
local Animal Care Committee (Office of Research Ethics,
University of Toronto). Timed-pregnant CD1 mice were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sherbrooke,
Quebec, Canada) and gave birth in the animal facility at the
University of Toronto. Mice were housed with an ambient
temperature of 20 ± 1°C and a 12-hour light/dark cycle with
free access to a standard laboratory chow diet and water.
All experiments were performed in a blinded manner; experimenters were not aware of treatment information for
all assessments.
Materials and drugs

Carvacrol (cat#W224502), Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO),
Tetrodotoxin (TTX), DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV), CNQX, nimodipine, poly-D-lysine
(Sigma) and tetracycline were purchased from SigmaAldrich, USA. MEM medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and other cell culture materials were purchased from
Gibco Life Technologies Corporation (USA). All other
reagents used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA
unless stated otherwise.
Cell cultures

HEK293 cells with stable expression of tetracyclineinducible flag-murine TRPM7/pCDNA4 were cultured
with Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented

Page 10 of 13

with 10% FBS, glutamax-1 (2 mM, Invitrogen, USA),
blasticidin (5 μg/mL) and zeocin (0.4 mg/mL, Invitrogen,
USA).
Primary neuronal culture was performed using E16 CD1
mice as described previously [11]. In brief, hippocampi or
cortices were dissected and digested with 0.025% Trypsin/
EDTA at 37°C for 15 min. Cell density was calculated using
an Improved Neubauer hemocytometer, and then plated
on poly-D-lysine-coated glass 12 mm round coverslips
(German Glass, Bellco cat #1943-10012) for electrophysiology experiments, or a poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well plate
for OGD experiments. The cells were kept in 5% CO2 and
95% humidified air at 37°C in serum-free culture medium
(Neurobasal medium supplemented with 1.8% B-27, 2%
HEPES, 0.25% Glutamax, and 1% antibiotic-antimyocotic).
Electrophysiology recordings

TRPM7 and TRPM7-like currents were recorded by
whole-cell patch-clamp using 400 ms voltage ramps
from −100 to +100 mV, with an interval of 5 s at 2 kHz
and digitized at 5 kHz using MultiClamp 700B, Digidata
1322A and Clampex 9.2 software. The pipette solution
for hippocampal neurons contained (in mM): 140 CsF,
35 CsOH, 10 HEPES, 2 tetraethylammonium chloride,
11 EGTA, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2 and 2 K2ATP (pH 7.3, 290–
300 mOsm/L) [46]. The pipette solution for recordings
in HEK293 cells contained (in mM): 145 cesium methanesulfonate, 10 EGTA, 8 NaCl and 10 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. The extracellular solution for
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings contained 140 mm
NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and
10 mm glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 (NaOH) [46]. Patch
pipette resistance was between 3–5 megaohms. When
recording the TRPM7-like currents in hippocampal neurons, 500nM TTX, 25 μM APV, 40 μM CNQX, and
5 μM nimodipine was added to the bath solution.
OGD experiment

Oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) has been well
established in our lab [28]. In brief, cortical neurons cultured in 96-well clear plates were incubated with carvacrol in oxygen-deprived solution for 30 minutes,
followed by incubation in an anaerobic chamber flushed
with 5% CO2 and 95% N2 (v/v) at 37°C for 60 minutes.
Cells were then incubated in normoxic conditions for an
additional 24 hours.
PI staining

OGD-induced cell injury was determined by propidium
iodide (PI) staining using a microplate reader (Syngery
H1, Biotek, USA) to detect fluorescence intensity. In
brief, cells were incubated with PI (5 μg/ml, Molecular
Probes, USA) for 20 minutes. Fluorescence intensity was
read using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and an

Chen et al. Molecular Brain (2015) 8:11

emission wavelength of 630 nm. PI enters the cell and
stains DNA in the nucleus when cell membrane integrity
is compromised during OGD. Greater fluorescence intensity indicates more cell damage in OGD. Moreover,
images of PI staining were taken to show damaged cells.
In brief, cells were stained with PI for 20 min, and then
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at
RT. After washing with PBS 3 times, cells were incubated overnight with anti-NeuN antibody (1:200,
Millipore, MAB377) and subsequently incubated with
anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa
Fluor® 488 (1:500, CST 4408) for 2 h at RT. Images
were taken using Zeiss LSM 710 Confocal Microscope.
The number of cells was counted using Image J. The
percentage of PI positive cells (%) = (PI positive cell
number/total cell number)*100%.

total infarct area of each section was determined by the
change in coloration. Infarct size was determined using
an image-analysis system (NIH Image J). The following
values were measured for each level brain slice: infarction area (A), the area of the ipsilateral hemisphere (B),
and the area of the contralateral hemisphere (C). Corrected infarct volume (CIV), (%) = [(B1 + B2 + B3 + B4)(A1 + A2 + A3 + A4)] /(C1 + C2 + C3 + C4)*100 [29,47].
Whole brains were dissected 7 days after HI and fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Brain tissues also
were sectioned coronally for Nissl staining (0.1% cresyl
violet). Briefly, brain slices of 30 μm were stained with
0.1% cresyl violet for 2 minutes and rinsed quickly in
distilled water. Representative images were captured
using a camera (Olympus, Japan) in the same field.
Neurobehavioral evaluation

Hypoxia–Ischemia and carvacrol administration

Mouse HI was carried out according to a method described previously [28,29]. Briefly, postnatal Day 7 (P7)
mice of both genders were anesthetized with isoflurane
(3.0% for induction and 1.5% for maintenance). The
right common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed and ligated. Mice were then returned to their dam and
allowed to recover for 1.5 hours and placed in an airtight, transparent chamber (A-Chamber A-15274 with
ProOx 110 Oxygen Controller/E-720 Sensor, Biospherix,
NY, USA) perfused with humidified gas mixture containing 7.5% oxygen balanced with 92.5% nitrogen at 37°C
for 100 minutes. Chamber temperature was monitored
using a homoeothermic blanket control unit (K-017484
Harvard Apparatus, Massachusetts, USA). Sham control
animals underwent anesthesia and the common carotid
artery was exposed without ligation and hypoxia.
Pups were randomly assigned to one of the following
groups: sham control group (Sham), HI + vehicle (Vehicle, 0.5% DMSO in normal saline) or HI + carvacrol
(CAR, 30 and 50 mg/Kg). Carvacrol was dissolved in
DMSO and then diluted with normal saline (NS). Vehicle solution was prepared with equivalent DMSO in
NS without carvacrol. Equivalent vehicle and carvacrol
solution were administered intraperitoneally 30 min before induction of HI.
Infarct volume evaluation, whole brain imaging and
histology

2, 3, 5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was
carried out as described previously [28,29]. Briefly,
24 hours after HI, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and sacrificed. Brains were removed and cut into
four coronal sections (approximately 2 mm apart). Brain
slices were immersed in TTC solution (1% in PBS, protected from light), incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes, and
scanned with a high-resolution scanner (Canon). The

All neurobehavioral evaluations were performed in a
blinded manner. 1, 3 and 7 days after HI, animals were
evaluated with 3 neurobehavioral tests [29].
Negative geotaxis is an automatic, stimulus-bound
orientation movement, which is considered to be diagnostic of vestibular and/or proprioceptive function. Pups
were placed head down in the middle of a plane inclined
at an angle of 45° [48]. The time taken to rotate 180°
was recorded. The latency to make a 180° turn was recorded up to a maximum time of 60 s.
Cliff avoidance reaction is used to assess the integration of exteroceptive input and locomotor output. Pups
were placed on the edge of a platform, and it was determined how much time was required for the pup to remove both paws from the edge, either by backing off or
turning away from the cliff. If the pup did not respond
within 60 s, it was recorded as 60 s [49].
A grip test was used to assess force and fatigability.
Pups were suspended by their forepaws on a wire
stretched horizontally 30 cm over a cotton pad in a cage.
The time it took for the animal to fall was recorded [50].
Immunofluorescence staining

Brain tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight and then sectioned (35 μm) using a Vibratome
Series 1000. TUNEL labeling was carried out using
TUNEL Apoptosis Detection Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Millipore, USA, S7165) [29]. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Images were taken
using a Zeiss Axioscope microscope. For NeuN, cleaved
caspase-3 and TRPM7 triple staining, brain slices were
incubated with anti-NeuN (1:200, Millipore, MAB377),
anti-cleaved caspase-3 (1:400, Cell Signaling Technology,
#9661) and anti-TRPM7 (1:50, Abcam, ab729) at 4°C
overnight. Then brain slices were incubated corresponding secondary antibody from Abcam (1:500): Donkey
Anti-Mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 488), Goat Anti-

Chen et al. Molecular Brain (2015) 8:11

Rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 568) and Donkey AntiGoat IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 405). Images were taken
using Zeiss LSM 710 Confocal Microscope.
Western blotting

Western blotting experiments were carried out as described previously [51,52]. Pups were sacrificed and brain
samples were collected on dry ice 24 hours after HI. Proteins of the ipsilateral hemisphere were extracted by
homogenization in RIPA buffer with proteinase inhibitor
cocktail (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) method (Pierce). Samples were separated on a 10%
SDS-PAGE gel and proteins were then transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane (200 mA per gel, 60 min). Blots
were probed with anti-TRPM7 antibody (1:1000, Abcam,
ab85016), anti-Bax Antibody (1:1000), anti-Bcl-2 (D17C4)
Rabbit mAb (1:1000), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473, 1:1000),
anti-Akt (C67E7, 1:1000) and anti-cleaved caspase-3
(1:500) antibodies (above antibodies were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass). Horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG
antibodies (1:7500, Sigma) were used as secondary antibodies and were detected with the ECL system (PerkinElmer, Inc, USA). β-actin (1:3000, Sigma) was used as a
control for protein loading. Images were analyzed using an
image-analysis system (NIH Image J 1.47v). Protein expression was normalized to that of β-actin and expressed
as percentage of control.
