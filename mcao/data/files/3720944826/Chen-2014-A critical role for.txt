The failure of past efforts to develop effective stroke treatments is at least partially because these treatments often interfered with
essential physiological functions, even though they are targeted toward pathophysiological events, such as inflammation, excitotoxicity,
and oxidative stress. Thus, the direct targeting of endogenous neuroprotective or destructive elements holds promise as a potential new
approach to treating this devastating condition. Interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), a transcription factor that regulates innate immune
responses, has been implicated in neurological pathology. Here, we provide new evidence that IRF9 directly mediates neuronal death in
male mice. In response to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), IRF9 accumulated in neurons. IRF9 deficiency markedly mitigated both poststroke
neuronal death and neurological deficits, whereas the neuron-specific overexpression of IRF9 sensitized neurons to death. The histone
deacetylase Sirt1 was identified as a novel negative transcriptional target of IRF9 both in vivo and in vitro. IRF9 inhibits Sirt1 deacetylase
activity, culminating in the acetylation and activation of p53-mediated cell death signaling. Importantly, both the genetic and pharmacological manipulation of Sirt1 effectively counteracted the pathophysiological effects of IRF9 on stroke outcome. These findings indicate
that, rather than activating a delayed innate immune response, IRF9 directly activates neuronal death signaling pathways through the
downregulation of Sirt1 deacetylase in response to acute I/R stress.

other than tissue plasminogen activator thrombolysis, which is
rather limited. The intricate biological pathways that control
neuronal death have been extensively investigated in the past two
decades (Lo et al., 2003; Lo, 2008; Tymianski, 2011). Various cell
death mechanisms, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis-like cell death, are triggered by cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, leading to catastrophic
histological loss and functional damage (Lo et al., 2003; Moskowitz et al., 2010). Immediately after ischemia, glutamate accumulates at synapses, followed by a dramatically enhanced influx of
calcium into neurons and the onset of catabolic processes (Ankarcrona et al., 1995; Lo et al., 2003). The high calcium level in
ischemic cells triggers potent oxygen radical production, which
directly damages lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates (Lo et al., 2003). The inflammatory response and apoptosis, which are critical to cell fate in the penumbra, typify the
secondary or delayed response to focal ischemia (Broughton et
al., 2009; Moskowitz et al., 2010; Chamorro et al., 2012; Lu et al.,
2013). Despite tremendous efforts and ⬎1000 clinical trials, the
drugs screened based on these approaches have not yielded prac-

tical results (Labiche and Grotta, 2004; Savitz and Schäbitz,
2008). This failure may be largely due to adverse side effects resulting from their interference with essential physiological
events. Thus, to circumvent this roadblock, information on the
signaling pathways that are directly involved in neuronal death is
urgently needed. Intriguingly, Vaseva et al. (2012) recently reported that the interaction between cyclophilin D and p53 evokes
stroke-induced tissue necrosis in the brain. Nevertheless, the
need to identify novel determinants of neuronal death remains,
and insight into their interplay remains to be explored.
Interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRFs) constitute a group
of proteins with nine members (IRF1–9) that were first recognized as transcriptional regulators of type I IFNs and IFNinducible genes (Paun and Pitha, 2007; Tamura et al., 2008; Yanai
et al., 2012). IRF9 is constitutively expressed and can be induced
by IFN-␥ (Ousman et al., 2005; Tamura et al., 2008). In addition,
IFN-␣/␤ stimulation may facilitate the formation of IFNstimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which comprises IRF9 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and 2
(STAT2). ISGF3 binds to the IFN-stimulated response elements
(ISREs) of Type I IFN-inducible genes (Darnell et al., 1994; Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2002). In addition to its role in the induction
of host defense mechanisms, IRF9 may also link pathological
stress with cell fate. For example, IRF9-RNAi, but not Stat1RNAi, inhibits IFN-␣-induced apoptosis (Tsuno et al., 2009).
Furthermore, p53 transcription cannot be induced by IFN-␣/␤ in
the absence of IRF9 (Takaoka et al., 2003). Interestingly, IRF9
may have additional functions beyond IFN signaling. We previously
demonstrated that IRF9 may regulate metabolic dysfunction
through the coactivation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor ␣ (PPAR␣) pathway (Wang et al., 2013c) and cardiac hypertrophy (Jiang et al., 2014). More importantly, several recent
studies have shown that IRF9 is involved in pathophysiological
events in the CNS, such as viral infection and IFN induction
(Ousman et al., 2005; Hofer et al., 2010). However, the role of
IRF9 in ischemic stroke is presently unknown.
The current study revealed a pathological role for IRF9 in
stroke. More importantly, IRF9 was found to be a negative transcriptional regulator of Sirt1, a previously recognized cerebroprotective factor that plays an active role during ischemia. In
response to I/R, IRF9 decreased Sirt1 activity and increased the
acetylation of p53, resulting in increased ischemic damage. Correspondingly, both the genetic and pharmacological manipulation of Sirt1 effectively ameliorated the pathophysiological effects
of IRF9 on stroke outcome. Thus, the IRF9/Sirt1 pathway is implicated in I/R injury.

Materials and Methods
Animals. All experiments with mice were performed in accordance with
protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Renmin
Hospital of Wuhan University. Global IRF9 knock-out mice (IRF9 ⫺/⫺,
C57BL/6J background) were kindly provided by Dr. Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine and
Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo) (Wang et al., 2013c). Neuronspecific Cre transgenic mice (CaMKII␣-Cre; stock #005359) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Genotyping of mouse strains was
performed using the following primers: CaMKII␣-Cre forward: 3⬘-GCGGTCTGGCAGTAAAAACTATC-5⬘; CaMKII␣-Cre reverse: 3⬘-GTGAA
ACAGCATTGCTGTCACTT-5⬘. Sirt1flox/flox homozygous mice were
generated by inserting a loxP-flanked neomycin cassette upstream of
exon 4 of the targeted gene and a third loxP site downstream of exon 4, as
previously described (Chen et al., 2008). The addition of the loxP sites
does not affect Sirt1 expression in homozygous mice. When these mice
are crossed with CaMKII␣-Cre mice that express neuron-specific Cre

recombinase, exon 4 is deleted in the neurons of the resulting offspring
(Sirt1-KO). The following primers were used for the PCR genotyping of
Sirt1flox/flox and Sirt1-KO mice: primer 1, 5⬘-GGTTGACTTAGGTCTTGTCTG-3⬘; primer 2, 5⬘-CGTCCCTTGTAATGTTTCCC-3⬘; and
primer 3, 5⬘-AGGCGGATTTCTGAGTTCGA-3⬘. Primer 1 and primer 2
were used to genotype the Sirt1flox/flox mice, and primer 2 and primer 3
were used to genotype the Sirt1-KO mice. Full-length mouse IRF9 cDNA
was inserted into the CAG-CAT-LacZ construct, which contains a CMV
enhancer and a chicken ␤-actin gene (CAG) promoter, and then linked
to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT ) gene flanked by loxP
sites. IRF9-floxed mice were produced by microinjecting the construct
into fertilized embryos (C57BL/6J background). Neuron-specific IRF9
transgenic mice (IRF9-TG) were produced by crossing IRF9-floxed mice
with CaMKII␣-Cre mice. GFAP-cre (stock #012887) and Lyz-Cre (stock
#004781) mice were both purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. These
two mouse lines were crossed with IRF9-floxed mice to generate
microglia- and astrocyte-specific IRF9 transgenic mice, respectively.
Similar procedures were used to obtain neuron-specific Sirt1 transgenic
mice (Sirt1-TG, C57BL/6J background). IRF9⫺/⫺ mice were crossed with
Sirt1-KO mice to produce IRF9⫺/⫺/Sirt1-KO double-knock-out mice
(DKO, C57BL/6J background), and Sirt1-TG and IRF9-TG mice were
crossed to generate IRF9/Sirt1 double-transgenic mice (DTG, C57BL/6J
background). All of the mice were housed in an environment with controlled light (12 h light/12 h dark), temperature and humidity, with food
and water available ad libitum. All the mice used in this study were
male and aged from 11 to 12 weeks (25–30 g), and all of the animal
experiments were performed by an experimenter who was blinded to
the genotypes.
Administration of the Sirt1 inhibitor or activator in vivo. The Sirt1 inhibitor EX527 (2780, Tocris Bioscience) was dissolved in DMSO and
diluted to the final concentration with normal saline (15 ␮l; the final
DMSO concentration was ⬍2%). We intracranially injected EX527 into
wild-type (WT) and IRF9 knock-out (IRF9-KO) mice 30 min before the
onset of middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO) at a dose of 30 ␮g.
Antithetically, the nontransgenic (NTG) and neuron-IRF9-TG mice
were intracranially injected with the Sirt1 agonist SRT1720 (S1129, Selleck), which was prepared in parallel with EX527 30 min before the onset
of MCAO at a dose of 30 ␮g. An identical volume of DMSO was injected
intracranially as a control.
Brain ischemia/reperfusion induced by surgical MCAO. Cerebral ischemia was induced by transient 45-min left-middle MCAO in mice under
isoflurane anesthesia as previously described (Wang et al., 2012a, b,
2013a, b). In brief, the mice were maintained at a rectal temperature of
37 ⫾ 0.5°C using a heating plate. The left common carotid artery was
exposed, and a 6-0 silicon-coated monofilament (Doccol) was inserted
into the internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery. After advancement into the cerebral arterial circle, the filament obstructed the
origin of the middle cerebral artery. Doppler analysis (Periflux System
5010; Perimed) was used to monitor the reduction and restoration of
regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). After the withdrawal of the filament,
CBF was restored for the time periods indicated in the text. The mice
were returned to a heated cage for 2 h to recover, with free access to food
and water. For the sham-operated controls, the filament was withdrawn
immediately after the CBF diminished. We recorded the heart rate, blood
gases, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
in randomly selected conscious mice. To verify the integrity of the cerebral vasculature, India ink staining was performed, as previously described (Wang et al., 2012b), and the circle of Willis was imaged using a
Nikon D700 digital camera. At 24 and 72 h after the induction of MCAO,
neurological deficits were tested using the following 9 point scale: (1)
absence of neurological deficits (0 points); (2) left forelimb flexion upon
suspension by the tail or failure to fully extend the right forepaw (1
point); (3) left shoulder adduction upon suspension by the tail (2 points);
(4) reduced resistance to a lateral push toward the left (3 points); (5)
spontaneous movement in all directions, with circling to the left only if
pulled by the tail (4 points); (6) circling or walking spontaneously only to
the left (5 points); (7) walking only when stimulated (6 points); (8) no
response to stimulation (7 points); and (9) stroke-related death (8
points) (Xia et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2013b).

Infarct volume quantification. All infarct quantification was performed
by a second examiner who was blinded to the genotypes and/or operation. We harvested the brains at 24 h, 72 h, or 7 d after MCAO, and 2%
2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was performed
as previously described (Wang et al., 2013a, b). Briefly, after being sectioned at 1 mm, a total of seven brain sections were incubated with TTC
solution for 15 min at 37°C and then fixed in 10% formalin solution for
8 h. Viable brain tissue was stained red, whereas a pale gray color indicated infarcted tissue. The images were captured and analyzed using
Image-Pro Plus (version 6.0). The infarct volume (%) of the seven slices
was calculated after correcting for edema, as previously described (Wang
et al., 2012a, 2013a, b).
MRI. After anesthetization with chloral hydrate (15307-500G-R,
Sigma), the mice were subjected to MRI scanning using a 7.0-T magnetic
resonance scanner (BioSpec 70/20USR, Bruker BioSpin). We maintained
the temperature using a built-in heating block, and the respiration of the
animal was monitored throughout the procedure. The parameters used
for imaging were as follows: slice thickness ⫽ 0.50 mm, field of view
(FOV) ⫽ 2 cm, echo time (TE)/repetition time (TR) ⫽ 26.7/2000 ms,
resolution ⫽ 0.078 mm ⫻ 0.078 mm, echo train length ⫽ 4, number of
averages ⫽ 4, matrix size ⫽ 256 ⫻ 256. The percentage of infarct volume
was summed (a total of five slices), multiplied by the slice thickness and
corrected for edema.
Immunohistology. The following primary antibodies were used for immunohistology: mouse anti-NeuN (MAB377; 1:200; Millipore), chicken
anti-MAP2 (Ab5392; 1:100; Abcam), rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3
(#9661; 1:100; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-IRF9 (sc10793; 1:50;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Sirt1 (sc15404; 1:50; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The following secondary antibodies were used for immunohistology: goat anti-chicken IgY (H&L, DyLight 488, ab96947; Abcam), goat anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor-488 conjugate (A11001;
Invitrogen), and anti-rabbit IgG-AlexaFluor-568 conjugate (A11011; Invitrogen). All specimens were fixed in 4% PFA in phosphate buffer for
6 – 8 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4°C in phosphate
buffer containing 30% sucrose, as previously described (Wang et al.,
2012b, 2013a, b). The brains were frozen in optimum cutting temperature compound and sectioned at 5 ␮m. Neuronal cells were cultured on
coverslips and fixed with ice-cold acetone. The cryosections or coverslips
were blocked in PBS containing 10% goat serum and incubated overnight with the primary antibody at 4°C. After several PBS rinses, the
indicated secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h. The nuclei were
stained with DAPI (S36939, Invitrogen). A TUNEL assay was performed
using an ApopTag Plus In Situ Apoptosis Fluorescein Detection Kit
(S7111; Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
TUNEL-positive cells were evaluated under microscopy and quantified
under high-power magnification (200⫻). To detect I/R-induced neuronal degeneration, the brain sections were stained with Fluoro-Jade B
(AG310, Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
images were acquired with a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS
DX51) and DP2-BSW software (version 2.2) and analyzed using Image
Pro Plus (version 6.0).
Tissue preparation. The mice were transcardially perfused, and the
brains were immediately removed. An experimenter, blinded to the genotype, then excised the olfactory bulbs and 1 mm sections of the anterior and posterior brain tissue. The remaining tissues of the ipsilateral
(including the infarct and peri-infarct areas) and contralateral (normal)
hemispheres were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at ⫺80°C.
Quantitative real-time PCR. RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(11667165001, Roche) following the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA

RNA sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from brain tissues in WT
and IRF9-KO mice as described above. RNAs were sequenced using an
Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument at Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI).
Immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Asp 175; #9661), anti-caspase-3
(#9662), anti-Bax (#2772), anti-GAPDH (2118), anti-Bcl2 (2870), and
anti-Cyto.c (4280) (all from Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000); antiIRF9 (sc10793), anti-Sirt1 (sc15404), anti-Noxa (sc30209), and antiCOX2 (sc23983) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-acetyl-p53

were incubated with 2 ml of 0.125% trypsin (Invitrogen) for 20 min at
37°C and neutralized in 4 ml of DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) containing
20% FBS (Invitrogen). After centrifuging for 5 min at 1000 rpm, the
pellet was resuspended in the same DMEM/FBS solution. The neurons
were filtered and seeded on plates coated with poly-L-lysine (10 mg/ml,
Sigma) before being cultured in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and AraC (5 ␮M, Sigma). After 5 d in
culture, the neurons were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation
(OGD) (serum-free, glucose-free Locke’s buffer; 95% N2 and 5% CO2,
pH 7.2) for 60 min in an experimental hypoxia chamber and returned to
normal culture conditions for the indicated periods. Neurons cultured in
neurobasal medium in a normal oxygen-conditioned incubator (95%
air, 5% CO2) for the same periods as the experimental cells served as
controls. In some experiments, we preincubated the cells with the Sirt1
inhibitors nicotinamide (V900517-250G, Sigma) and EX527 (2780, Tocris Bioscience) together with the Sirt1 activators resveratrol (1418, Tocris
Bioscience) and SRT1720 (S1129, Selleck) for 30 min before the neuronal
cultures were subjected to OGD/reperfusion. Nicotinamide, EX527, resveratrol, and SRT1720 were used at a concentration of 5 ␮M in the in vitro
experiments. An identical volume of DMSO was used as the control.
Sirt1 deacetylase activity assays. Sirt1 deacetylase activity was determined with a SIRT1 Fluorometric Drug Discovery Kit (BIOMOL International) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Brain and cell extracts
were incubated for 80 min at 37°C with Sirt1 substrate reagent and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ⫹. The deacetylase activity was detected
as a fluorescent signal at 460 nm with an excitation wavelength at 405 nm
using a spectrophotometer.
Plasmid constructs and transfection. To generate Myc-tagged IRF9,
we first amplified the murine IRF9 gene-encoding region with primers
5⬘-CCGGAATTCATGGCATCAGGCAGGGCACG-3⬘ and 5⬘-CCGCTC
GAGCTACACCAGGGACAGAATGGCTG-3⬘ using HA-IRF9 vector as
a template. The murine IRF9 protein-coding sequence was then inserted
into the Myc-C1 vector to obtain Myc-IRF9. Transient transfection was
conducted using a FuGENE transfection reagent (E2312; Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Recombinant adenoviral vectors. We constructed adenoviruses carrying
sequences encoding rat IRF9 (AdIRF9) and Sirt1 (AdSirt1) as well as short
hairpin RNAs targeting IRF9 (shIRF9) or Sirt1 (AdshSirt1) for the in vitro
studies. AdIRF9 and AdshIRF9 were generated as described previously
(Wang et al., 2013c). Replication-defective adenoviral vectors were used
to overexpress rat Sirt1 (AdSirt1) under the control of the CMV promoter, and a similar adenoviral vector expressing GFP was used as a
control. To knock down Sirt1 expression, three SureSilencing mouse
shSirt1 constructs were obtained from SABiosciences (KM05054G), and
the construct that produced the most significant reduction in Sirt1 levels
was selected for further experiments (designated as AdshSirt1). The cultured cortical neurons were transfected with adenovirus at an MOI of 100
for 24 h.
Cell viability. To examine cell viability, a nonradioactive cell counting
kit-8 (CCK-8) assay (CK04, Dojindo) and a colorimetric LDH cytotoxicity assay (G1780, Promega) were used according to the manufacturer’s
protocols. At least three independent experiments were performed by a
second examiner who was blinded to the treatments.
Dual luciferase-reporter assay. Adenovirus encoding Sirt1-luc was generated by inserting the 1470 bp Sirt1 promoter region into the pGL3-basic
vector (Promega) using the primers 5⬘-CCGCTCGAGCCCTCCT
CCCTCGCCTCCT-3⬘ (forward) and 5⬘-CCGACGCGTCCTAATGC
TCTCCCTCCCCT-3⬘ (reverse). This vector was then recombined with
the pAdEasy backbone vector as described above. The primary cortical
neurons were cultured in 24-well plates, and cells at 50%– 80% confluence were infected with the indicated recombinant adenoviruses. A re-

Results
IRF9 accumulates in ischemic cerebral tissue
IRF9 expression can be induced in the CNS by several forms of
stress, including viral infection and axonal transection (Ousman
et al., 2005; Khorooshi and Owens, 2010); however, the response
of IRF9 to I/R is not clear. Cerebral ischemia induced by MCAO
closely mimics the pathologies observed during human stroke
(Engel et al., 2011). To study the biological impact of IRF9 on
ischemic stroke, we first examined the expression pattern of IRF9
in a mouse model of stroke. In response to MCAO/reperfusion
(MCAO for 45 min followed by reperfusion for 72 h after the
stroke onset), IRF9 expression increased in brain homogenates in
a time-dependent manner. IRF9 was induced as early as 2 h after
MCAO and further increased by ⬃2.7-fold of its normal expression level in the brain by 72 h (Fig. 1A). Neurons are at particular
risk of ischemic injury due to their high energy demand (Tymianski, 2011). IRF9 was expressed at low levels in the contralateral
(control) cortex (Fig. 1 B, C). However, when the ipsilateral cortex was subjected to MCAO/reperfusion in vivo, heavy IRF9
staining was observed. This pattern of IRF9 was coexpressed
with neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) (Fig. 1B) and
microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP2) (Fig. 1C). Importantly, IRF9 aggregated in both cortical and striatal neurons but
not in the hippocampus (Fig. 1D), where cerebral blood flow was
not compromised by MCAO (Engel et al., 2011). Therefore, IRF9

is specifically induced in neurons upon I/R insult. To rule out
potential systemic or inflammatory interference, rat primary cortical neurons were isolated and challenged with OGD for 1 h,
followed by normal culture conditions for the indicated time
periods (Fig. 1E). Neurons subjected to OGD displayed a timedependent increase in the expression of IRF9 in vitro, as shown by
immunostaining (Fig. 1F ) and Western blot analyses (Fig. 1G).
Next, we sought to determine the potential clinical significance of
these observations in human samples. Considering that it was
almost impossible to obtain samples from ischemic stroke patients, we examined the expression of IRF9 in normal and intracerebral hemorrhagic human brains. ICH leads to significant
neuronal loss after blood entry. To a certain extent, this effect
mimics the detrimental cerebral injury and neuronal death in
ischemic stroke. Interestingly, we found that ICH increases IRF9
protein expression by ⬃1.6-fold (Fig. 1H ). Together, these data
indicate that IRF9 in neurons may play a functional role in stroke
pathology in both mice and humans.
IRF9 exacerbates poststroke cerebral injury
Considering that neuronal IRF9 is robustly induced by I/R, we
investigated whether a forced overexpression of IRF9 in neurons
would contribute to I/R-induced cerebral injury. IRF9-TG were
generated by crossing Irf9flox/flox mice with mice carrying a Cre
recombinase driven by the neuron-specific promoter CaMKII␣
(Fig. 2A). IRF9-TG3 (hereafter referred to as IRF9-TG) mice displayed a 4.27-fold increase in cerebral IRF9 expression (Fig. 2B),
which is similar to the increase observed in mice during stroke.
Because of the profound effects of blood pressure and heart rate
on stroke outcome, we first examined these parameters in NTG
and IRF9-TG mice before MCAO (Table 1). No significant differences were observed between the two mouse strains, and IRF9
overexpression in neurons did not compromise vascular integrity
(Fig. 2D). In addition, both NTG and IRF9-TG mice underwent
comparable regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) perfusion during the course of I/R (Fig. 2F ). Compared with the NTG mice, the
IRF9-TG mice exhibited an increase in infarct volume of
⬃128.45% and 72.77% at 24 and 72 h after MCAO, respectively
(Fig. 2G,H ). Functionally, IRF9-TG mice exhibited exacerbated
neurological deficits at both time points (47.37% increase at 24 h
and 38.66% increase at 72 h) (Fig. 2I ). In live IRF9-TG mice, the
lesion size was also larger at 24 h than that observed in the NTG
mice, as shown by imaging (Fig. 2J ) and as evaluated by MRI (Fig.

2K ). Thus, the induction of IRF9 in neurons evidently contributes to the progression of cerebral lesions after I/R.
Next, we assessed whether IRF9 upregulation is required for
ischemic cerebral damage. IRF9 ablation had no impact on blood
pressure, heart rate, vascular integrity, or rCBF (Table 1; Fig.
2C,E). However, IRF9-KO mice that were challenged with I/R for
24 h, 72 h, or 7 d had significantly improved stroke outcomes
compared with WT mice, both histologically (Fig. 2 L, M ) and
functionally (Fig. 2N ). This cerebroprotective effect of IRF9 ablation was confirmed by MRI in live mice (Fig. 2O,P). Moreover,
we investigated whether IRF9 targeted other cell types in the CNS,
namely, astrocytes and microglia. Astrocyte- (GFAP-Cre/IRF9TG) and microglia-specific IRF9-overexpressing transgenic
(Lyz-Cre/IRF9-TG) mice were generated. After I/R, both
transgenic mouse lines showed a similar infarct volume and
neurological deficits compared with their control littermates
(Fig. 2Q,R). Collectively, these findings unambiguously demonstrate that IRF9 mediates ischemic brain damage by directly
targeting neurons.
IRF9 potentiates postischemic neuronal death
Given that neuronal IRF9 is specifically induced by I/R and that
neuron-specific IRF9 sufficiently potentiates cerebral injury, we
investigated whether IRF9 exerts a direct effect on neuronal survival. Therefore, we infected rat primary cortical neurons with
either AdshIRF9, which reduced IRF9 expression by ⬎90% (data
not shown), or its scrambled control, AdshRNA. Indeed, the
IRF9-silenced neurons were more resistant to OGD-induced cell
death, as evidenced by their significantly enhanced cell viability
and reduced LDH release (Fig. 3 A, B); conversely, IRF9 overexpression (Ad-IRF9) rendered the neurons more vulnerable to
OGD-induced cell death (Fig. 3C,D).
Necrosis and apoptosis are fundamental mechanisms of the
cell death that ensues after stroke. Because IRF9 continues to be
involved in ischemic injury even 7 d after stroke onset, we hypothesized that IRF9 may exert a more prominent effect on delayed neuronal death. To test this hypothesis, we next performed
Fluoro-Jade B TUNEL staining in IRF9-KO and IRF9-TG mice
24 h after MCAO (Fig. 3E). Fluoro-Jade B is a specific marker for
acutely degenerating neurons, regardless of the cause of death
(Schmued and Hopkins, 2000). IRF9 ablation reduced the number of Fluoro-Jade B-positive cells by ⬃78.73% and TUNELpositive cells by ⬎90%. By contrast, Fluoro-Jade B-positive cells
and TUNEL-positive cells were increased by 1.04-fold and 1.72fold, respectively, in IRF9-TG mice (Fig. 3F ). Thus, IRF9 is critical for I/R-induced neuronal degeneration and apoptosis. The
proapoptotic effect of IRF9 was further confirmed by immunostaining of cleaved caspase-3 in vivo (Fig. 3G). Western blot analysis showed that the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2
was decreased and the expression levels of the proapoptotic protein cleaved caspase3 were increased in WT and NTG mice at 6 h
after I/R compared with sham controls (Fig. 3 H, I ); however,
these changes were significantly attenuated in IRF9-KO mice
(Fig. 3H ) and enhanced in IRF9-TG mice compared with WT
and NTG mice, respectively (Fig. 3I ). These results suggest a
critical role for IRF9 in neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, the temporal expression patterns of these proteins were similar in OGDtreated primary neuronal cells infected with AdshIRF9 (Fig. 3J )
or Ad-IRF9 (Fig. 3K ). To establish a causal link between IRF9 and
caspase-3 activation, we further investigated whether IRF9 promoted cytochrome c release. In response to I/R, cytochrome c was
released from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. However, IRF9
knock-out significantly repressed this release (Fig. 3L), whereas

Chen et al. • IRF9 Aggravates Ischemic Stroke

IRF9 overexpression facilitated this biological process (Fig. 3M ).
Together, these data indicate that IRF9 accelerates neuronal apoptosis in response to stroke insult.
IRF9 downregulates Sirt1 expression
To investigate the regulatory mechanism of IRF9 in response to
I/R insults, penumbra tissues were harvested from WT and
IRF9-KO mice after 24 h of MCAO/reperfusion. Next, mRNAs
were extracted from these tissues and screened using a genomewide mRNA array. It was determined that the mRNA levels of a
dozen genes involved in ischemic injury, including Egr1, MYC,
and FOXO3, were significantly altered in IRF9-KO mice compared with WT controls (Table 2; Fig. 4A). Intriguingly, these
genes are regulated by the deacetylase Sirt1, a putative prosurvival
gene that protects against poststroke cerebral injury (Liu et al.,
2009; Hernández-Jiménez et al., 2013). Using real-time PCR, we
observed that Sirt1 mRNA levels were also upregulated by ⬎2fold in IRF9-KO mice (Fig. 4B).
To further explore these findings, we examined the effects of
manipulating the IRF9 expression level on cerebral Sirt1 protein
expression. Western blot analysis showed that an increase in IRF9
protein expression in the poststroke penumbra was accompanied
by an ⬃56.48% decrease in Sirt1 in WT mice (Fig. 4C). Nevertheless, Sirt1 expression was largely maintained in IRF9-KO mice
at a time point of 6 h after I/R (Fig. 4C). By contrast, the overexpression of IRF9 in neurons led to an ⬃47.28% reduction in
penumbral Sirt1 expression compared with NTG mice (Fig. 4D),
indicating that IRF9 exerts an inhibitory effect on Sirt1 expression. The negative correlation between IRF9 and Sirt1 expression
was further validated in primary cortical neurons in vitro (Fig.
4 E, F ). Indeed, a costaining of Sirt1 and NeuN demonstrated
that, at 24 h after MCAO, the number of Sirt1-positive neurons
increased by ⬃2-fold in IRF9-KO mice and decreased to ⬍50%
in IRF9-TG mice compared with their control littermates
(Fig. 4G).
Given that IRF9 is a well-characterized transcription factor
targeting the ISREs of downstream genes, we investigated
whether the inhibitory effect of IRF9 on Sirt1 expression was
attributable to IRF9-dependent transcriptional regulation. Thus,
we examined Sirt1 promoter activity in HEK293 and PC12 cell
lines transfected with IRF9 or an empty vector after OGD/reperfusion (Fig. 4H ). The overexpression of IRF9 reduced Sirt1
promoter luciferase activity to 13.07% and 11.99% of the controls in HEK293 and PC12 cell lines (Fig. 4H ), respectively, as
well as in primary cortical neuronal cultures infected with AdIRF9 (79.40% reduction compared with Ad-GFP; Fig. 4I ). Intriguingly, overexpressing IRF9, but not its scrambled controls,
inhibited the luciferase activity of Sirt1-Luc in N2A cells in a

dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4J ). Next, we performed a ChIP
assay of IRF9 followed by quantitative PCR of the murine Sirt1
promoter (Fig. 4K ). Using bioinformatics approaches, a series of
putative ISRE binding sites, designated P1-P5, were identified
(Fig. 4K ). To increase the specificity of the ChIP analysis, only
sequences containing at least two ISRE repeats (5⬘-GAAA-3⬘)
were considered as potential IRF9 binding sites. We observed that
IRF9 ChIPs were enriched for the P3 region but not any of the
other regions, indicating that P3 contains the primary site for
IRF9 binding (Fig. 4 K, L). To assess whether the inhibition of
Sirt1 expression is necessary for IRF9-mediated neuronal apoptosis, we infected primary cortical neurons with AdshIRF9, AdshSirt1, or both AdshIRF9 and AdshSirt1 (Fig. 4M ). Coinfection
with AdshSirt1 completely abolished the neuroprotective effect of
IRF9 ablation (Fig. 4M ). Conversely, IRF9-mediated neuronal
death was reversed by infection with adenovirus overexpressing
Sirt1 (AdSirt1) (Fig. 4N ). These data show that, during ischemic
stroke, the upregulation of IRF9 negatively regulates Sirt1 transcription, thereby inhibiting Sirt1 expression and eventually culminating in neuronal death.
IRF9 increases p53 acetylation and activation
p53, a critical transcriptional activator that controls apoptotic
programs, was the first nonhistone deacetylation target identified
for Sirt1 (Luo et al., 2001; Vaziri et al., 2001). Hasegawa and
Yoshikawa (2008) recently reported that p53-induced DNA
damage can be reduced via Sirt1-mediated p53 deacetylation in
cortical neurons. In addition, Raz et al. (2011) showed that global
cerebral ischemia enhanced p53 acetylation in the hippocampal
CA1 region. Thus, we hypothesized that the IRF9-Sirt1 axis may
regulate neuronal death through p53-dependent apoptotic programs. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we examined the
effect of IRF9 on p53 acetylation. At 6 h after I/R in WT mice, p53
became acetylated, and the expression of myriad of p53dependent proapoptotic proteins, including Bax, Noxa, and
Puma, to name just a few, increased (Fig. 5 A, B). By contrast,
IRF9-KO caused a significant decrease in the expression of acetylp53, Bax, Noxa, and Puma compared with WT mice in the setting
of ischemic stroke (Fig. 5A), an effect that was reversed by the
neuron-specific overexpression of IRF9 in vivo (Fig. 5B). Importantly, the total p53 expression level was not altered by IRF9 gene
manipulation (Fig. 5 A, B). IRF9 also positively regulated the
mRNA levels of Bax, Noxa, and Puma (Fig. 5C), suggesting that
IRF9 facilitates both the acetylation of p53 and p53 transactivation. The activation of p53 apoptotic programs was further confirmed in a complementary in vitro experiment (Fig. 5D). Next,
we assessed whether p53 is essential for IRF9-mediated neuronal
death. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of p53
( p53siRNA) reduced p53 expression to ⬍35% of controls (data
not shown), whereas Addnp53, an adenovirus harboring a
dominant-negative form of p53, reduced p53 activity to ⬃6.41%
and 16.50% in N2A cells and primary cortical neurons, respectively (Fig. 5 E, F ). p53siRNA largely reversed OGD-induced cell
death in the primary neurons isolated from NTG and IRF9-TG
mice (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, AdIRF9-mediated neuronal death
was completely abolished when the cells were coinfected with
Addn-p53 (Fig. 5H ). Thus, p53 is suggested to be a major downstream effector of the IRF9 signaling pathway. Together, these
data demonstrate that IRF9-induced neuronal death is mediated
by the acetylation and transactivation of p53.

Sirt1 is required for IRF9/p53-mediated ischemic
neuronal death
Having established that IRF9 inhibits Sirt1 transcription and that
IRF9 mediates p53 acetylation and transactivation, we examined
whether the IRF9-p53 axis relies on Sirt1 expression in vivo.
IRF9-KO mice were crossed with Sirt1-KO mice to generate DKO
(Fig. 6 A, B). Notably, Sirt1 deacetylase activity was not significantly different between the Sirt1-KO and DKO mice (Fig. 6C).
Importantly, we observed that stroke outcomes were exacerbated
in the DKO mice compared with the IRF9-KO mice but were
comparable in the Sirt1-KO and DKO mice (Fig. 6D–F ). Accordingly, IRF9-KO-mediated neuronal survival, decreased p53 acetylation, and neuronal apoptosis were all abrogated in the DKO
mice (Fig. 6G–I ).
To further examine the relationship between the IRF9-Sirt1
axis and p53-dependent apoptotic programs, we crossed
IRF9-TG mice with neuron-specific Sirt1 transgenic (Sirt1-TG)
mice to generate DTG mice (Fig. 6J ), which we validated by
Western blotting (Fig. 6K ). Decreased Sirt1 activity in the
IRF9-TG mice was fully restored in the DTG mice to a level
comparable with the Sirt1-TG mice (Fig. 6L). DTG mice showed
a substantial amelioration of deteriorated stroke outcomes (Fig.
6M–O), neuronal survival (Fig. 6 P, Q), and inhibited p53 apoptotic programs (Fig. 6R) compared with the IRF9-TG mice.
Similar to the results obtained with the KO mice, these results
were comparable between the Sirt1-TG and DTG mice (Fig. 6L–
R). Based on these data, we conclude that Sirt1 is required for
IRF9-mediated p53 acetylation and neuronal death.
IRF9-mediated cerebral injury is dependent on Sirt1
deacetylase activity
Finally, considering that Sirt1 is a well-recognized deacetylase, we
investigated whether Sirt1 deacetylase activity was responsible for
the IRF9-mediated effects of stroke. After I/R, Sirt1 activity was
negatively correlated with IRF9 expression both in vivo (Fig. 7A)
and in vitro (Fig. 7B). Indeed, the overexpression of a Sirt1
deacetylase mutant (H363Y) failed to rescue neurons from IRF9mediated death (Fig. 7C). Next, we treated neuronal cultures with
the Sirt1 inhibitors nicotinamide and EX527 or with the Sirt1

activators resveratrol and SRT1720 before subjecting them to
OGD/reperfusion (Fig. 7 D, E). Cell survival assays indicated that
Sirt1 activity was both sufficient and necessary for the IRF9mediated neuronal death. To further examine this phenomenon
in vivo, we intracranially injected either EX527 or SRT1720 into
IRF9-KO or IRF9-TG mice, respectively, before challenging the
mice with MCAO/reperfusion. EX527, a Sirt1-specific inhibitor,
diminished Sirt1 activity in the neurons derived from IRF9-KO
mice; conversely, SRT1720 specifically activated Sirt1 activity
upon IRF9 overexpression (Fig. 7F ). Importantly, the intracranial injection of EX527 or SRT1720 into IRF9-KO mice or
IRF9-TG mice, respectively, recapitulated our observations in the
IRF9/Sirt1-DKO or -DTG mice with respect to stroke outcome
(Fig. 7G,H ), neuronal death (Fig. 7 I, J ), and p53 signaling (Fig.
7 K, L). Together, these findings indicate that IRF9 is a previously
unrecognized negative regulator of the Sirt1/p53 axis. Furthermore, our results show that the IRF9-Sirt1-p53 axis is functionally necessary for ischemic cerebral injury.

Discussion
This study demonstrates that a previously unrecognized pathway
is activated upon cerebral I/R stress. I/R-induced IRF9 represses
Sirt1 expression, leading to the acetylation of p53, thereby instigating neuronal death. Moreover, these results show that neuronal IRF9 is a direct mediator of brain injury after ischemia and
reperfusion. Neurons are a major source of endogenous prodeath
and neuroprotective regulators (Lo, 2008; Andrabi et al., 2011;
Yenari and Han, 2012). Consistent with this notion, neuronal
IRF9 was observed to be specifically upregulated in response to
I/R. Indeed, the neuron-specific overexpression of IRF9 rendered
neurons more vulnerable to I/R stress, culminating in larger infarct lesions and more severe neurological dysfunction. Conversely, IRF9 deletion in neurons markedly mitigated both
poststroke neuronal death and neurological deficits. Moreover,
the deacetylase Sirt1 was found to be a novel negative transcriptional target for IRF9. IRF9 downregulated Sirt1 expression,
resulting in the enhanced acetylation and activation of p53 celldeath signaling. In agreement with this finding, IRF9/Sirt1-DKO
mice exhibited a similar phenotype to that observed in Sirt1-KO
mice, whereas the detrimental effect of IRF9 overexpression observed in the IRF9-TG mice was completely reversed in the IRF9/
Sirt1-DTG mice. Finally, the Sirt1-specific inhibitor EX527
sufficiently counteracted the beneficial effects of IRF9 deletion on
stroke; conversely, the Sirt1-specific activator SRT1720 ameliorated the enhanced I/R injury in IRF9-TG mice. Notably, we also
used human ICH samples to investigate the effect of IRF9 on
acute cerebrovascular injuries in humans due to the difficulty of
obtaining human ischemic stroke samples. Indeed, studies on
human patients should be particularly cautious. However, the
induction of IRF9 in the ICH samples, at least in part, indicated a
potential clinical significance of IRF9 upregulation during I/R, as
apoptosis was also detected in the perihematomal zone in human brains. Thus, we will focus on the translation of the IRF9Sirt1-p53 pathway into clinical therapeutic approaches in
future studies.
Sirt1 is the closest mammalian homolog of yeast Sir2, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase
(Imai et al., 2000). In addition to histones, Sirt1 deacetylates a
large number of transcription factors that are involved in diverse
biological processes (Luo et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2005). Most
studies characterize Sirt1 as a survival factor that protects against
aging-associated pathologies, including cardiovascular disease,
metabolic disorders, oncogenesis, and, importantly, neurode-

generation (Li et al., 2011; Zhou et al.,
2011; Donmez, 2012; Jeong et al., 2012;
Paraíso et al., 2013). Sirt1 was found to be
protective against a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s
disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease, through the deacetylation of either prodeath or prosurvival
substrates (Kim et al., 2007; Outeiro et al.,
2007; Donmez, 2012; Jeong et al., 2012;
Jiang et al., 2012). Several reports have
shown that Sirt1 protein expression and
deacetylase activity are altered during
stroke (Zhu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011;
Hernández-Jiménez et al., 2013). Recently, Hernández-Jiménez et al. (2013)
reported that Sirt1 potentiates poststroke
ischemic neuronal damage in whole-body
Sirt1 KO mice. However, the underlying
molecular mechanisms by which Sirt1 is
regulated remain unknown. Moreover, to
our knowledge, the direct neuroprotective role of Sirt1 during ischemic stroke is
also undefined. Here, we demonstrate
that IRF9 induction after cerebral injury
leads to the suppression of Sirt1 expression and subsequent neuronal survival.
Intriguingly, Sirt1 is predominantly expressed in neurons, indicating that, during I/R, the IRF9-Sirt1 axis may be neuron
specific. Moreover, we showed that both
Sirt1 expression and activity are essential
for IRF9-mediated neuronal death. Sirt1
expression is negatively regulated by several different transcription factors, including PPAR␥, HIC1, and ChREBP;
however, this regulation reportedly occurs most often when the cells are energy
deprived (Chen et al., 2005; Han et al.,
2010; Noriega et al., 2011). Until now, little was known regarding the transcriptional modulation of Sirt1 expression
under acute stress. Here, we show that
IRF9 negatively regulates Sirt1 expression
in response to acute I/R. In I/R-stimulated
neurons, upregulated IRF9 directly binds
to the ISRE region in the Sirt1 promoter.

completely abrogated the IRF9-mediated neuronal death induced by OGD. Thus, under cerebral I/R stress, Sirt1 is a functional target of IRF9. Given the extensive roles of Sirt1 in
neurological diseases, the prodeath function of IRF9 may extend
to other neurodegenerative diseases in which Sirt1 exerts critical
neuroprotective effects (Kim et al., 2007; Outeiro et al., 2007;
Donmez, 2012; Jeong et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2012). Collectively,
our data indicate that IRF9 is a major negative regulator of neuronal survival. Furthermore, both in vivo and in vitro experiments
clearly demonstrated that Sirt1 is a major downstream target of
IRF9 during the course of ischemic neuronal death.
The first nonhistone substrate identified for Sirt1 was p53
(Luo et al., 2001). Sirt1 deacetylates p53 under various pathological conditions (Luo et al., 2001; Vaziri et al., 2001). Under ischemic stress, p300 interacts with p53 to facilitate p53 acetylation
and coactivate p53-dependent proapoptotic genes, including
Puma and Bax, leading to neuronal death. Here, we showed that
p53 is necessary for IRF9-induced neuronal death. Notably,
Takaoka et al. (2003) recently reported that IRF9 is required for
IFN-␣/␤-induced p53 upregulation, and it directly binds to the
ISRE of the p53 gene. Based on our data, we cannot exclude the
possibility that p53 transcription is directly regulated by IRF9.
Nonetheless, we observed that the genetic manipulation of IRF9
did not have any impact on p53 protein expression in either the
MCAO or the OGD model. It is also noteworthy that p53 binds to
the promoter of IRF9 in response to viral infection, thereby enhancing IRF9 protein expression (Muñoz-Fontela et al., 2008).
Therefore, it is conceivable that, during I/R, IRF9-activated p53
further upregulates IRF9, consequently forming a positive feedback loop. Neuronal survival during ischemic stroke is vital for
the maintenance of neurological function, which is the single
most important outcome in human patients (Vosler and Chen,
2009). We demonstrated that either interference or knockdown
of p53 sufficiently counteracted the prodeath effects of IRF9 in
vitro. Furthermore, conditional Sirt1 overexpression blocked
IRF9-mediated p53 acetylation and improved behavioral outcomes in vivo, supporting the notion that the IRF9/Sirt1/p53
pathway is crucial for cerebroprotection in the course of ischemic
stroke.
In conclusion, we determined that the primary pathological
role of IRF9 in ischemic stroke is to negatively regulate the transcription of the deacetylase Sirt1, leading to p53 acetylation and
activation. To the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate here,
for the first time, that acute stress other than viral infection induces IRF9 expression in neurons, a particularly vulnerable and
indispensable cell type in the CNS. More importantly, the biological effects of IRF9 are linked with molecular pathways that directly initiate neuronal death and cerebral injury upon I/R stress.
Considering the role of Sirt1 in neurodegenerative diseases and
I/R-induced injury in other organs, interventions aimed at inhibiting IRF9 induction may be able to contribute to Sirt1-mediated
cell survival.
