Abstract: Inflammatory activation plays a vital role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke and diabetes mellitus
(DM), exerts the deleterious effects on the progression of the brain and leads to vascular damage in diabetic stroke. The
objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of 8-O-acetyl shanzhiside methylester (ND01) on tumour necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a)-stimulated SH-SY5Y cell line in vitro and the experimental ischaemic diabetic stroke model in vivo. TNFa-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells were pre-incubated with ND01, then analysed protein expression. For in vivo experiment, the
diabetic rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 30 min. followed by reperfusion for 23 hr.
Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with ND01 blocked TNF-a-induced nuclear transcription factor jB (NF-jB) activation and
decreased high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) expression. ND01 40 mg/kg demonstrated significant neuroprotective effect
even after delayed administration at 4 hr after I/R. ND01 40 mg/kg attenuated the histopathological damage, decreased brain
swelling, inhibited NF-jB activation and reduced HMGB-1 expression in ischaemic brain tissue. These data show that ND01
protects diabetic brain against I/R injury with a favourable therapeutic time-window by alleviating diabetic cerebral I/R injury
and attenuating blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, and its protective effects may involve HMGB-1 and NF-jB signalling
pathway.

Ischaemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability,
resulting in reduced blood flow in a major brain artery. A
large number of survivors experience permanent neurological
damage that impacts the quality of life. The key recommendation of Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable
(STAIR) VII is still to extend intravenous thrombolysis to a
broader patient population, clarifying the risk and benefits of
intra-arterial reperfusion therapies. However, STAIR proposes
development of neuroprotective therapies [1].
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is not only associated with microvascular and macrovascular diseases affecting several organs
including brain, but also a major contributor to the incidence of
stroke which is 2–5 times higher than for non-DM patients.
Compared with the non-diabetic stroke patient, one year after
stroke and mortality of DM patients with stroke significantly
increased, long-term neurological defects are more obvious
[2,3]. It is very serious that the number of Chinese diabetes
patient has been growing fast for nearly 20 years [4]. Therefore,
investigation of the neuroprotective effects on diabetic (streptozotocin induced) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats
is warranted more than for the non-diabetic MCAO rats.
The inflammatory response to brain injury and DM, especially nuclear transcription factor jB (NF-jB) activation, plays
a vital role in the pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke and DM

[5,6]. High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1) is a non-histone
DNA-binding protein, which releases into the extracellular
space immediately after an ischaemic insult and induced neuroinflammation and microglial activation in the post-ischaemic
brain, and plays a significant role in the progression of ischaemic brain injury [7–9]. Thus, HMGB-1 is a key regulator of
the neuro-immune system, which is involved in the progression of diabetic stroke. Therefore, inhibition of HMGB-1
release may be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating diabetic cerebral ischaemia.
8-O-acetyl shanzhiside methylester (ND01) is an iridoid glucoside, which is isolated from the leaves of Lamiophlomis rotata (Benth.) Kudo., a Chinese folk medicinal plant in Xi-zang
(Tibet). For thousands of years, Lamiophlomis rotata has been
used as one of the traditional drugs with the effects of alleviating pain, detumescence, haemostasis, reinforcing marrow and
promoting blood circulation to remove blood stasis. Previous
studies indicate that ND01 attenuates apoptosis and ameliorates mitochondrial energy metabolism in rat cortical neurones
exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation [10], increases angiogenesis and improves functional recovery after stroke [11]. No
reports have demonstrated the role of HMGB-1 and NF-jB in
the neuroprotective effect of ND01 on the diabetic rats with
cerebral ischaemic injury. In this study, we therefore investigated the hypothesis that ND01 plays a neuroprotective role
through the abrogation of HMGB-1 release and NF-jB activation triggered by tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and ameliorates the diabetic rats with MCAO-induced cerebral
ischaemia/reperfusion injury.

Materials and Methods

Materials. 8-O-acetyl shanzhiside methylester (ND01, purity >
98.5%) was provided by State Key Laboratory of Long-acting
Extended-Release and Targeting Drug Delivery System, Yantai,
China).
NF-jB activation and HMGB-1 expression in TNF-a-stimulated SHSY5Y cells. Human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells were obtained
from Shanghai Cell Bank of Chinese Academy Sciences. SH-SY5Y
cells were cultured and maintained in F12+ DMEM (1:1, v/v) media,
supplemented with 10% phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were kept at 37°C in a humidified 5%
CO2/95% O2 incubator. The dissociated cells were seeded in poly-Llysine-coated plates at a density of 5 9 105/cm2 and cultured in DMEM
(Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum,
5% (v/v) foetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml
streptomycin. The fresh medium was changed twice weekly.
For the experiment of TNF-a-stimulated SH-SY5Y cell lines in vitro, SH-SY5Y cells (5 9 106) were pre-incubated with ND01 (9 lM)
or HMGB-1 inhibitor, glycyrrhizin (100 lM) for 120 min., and then
incubated with TNF-a (20 ng/ml) for 30 min. and cultured in a CO2
incubator for 12 hr. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS on
ice and lysed in NP40 lysis buffer (Biosource, Camarillo, CA, USA)
(50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF,
1 mM Na3VO4, 1% NP-40 and 0.02% NaN3) supplemented with
1 mM PMSF and 1 9 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St Louis,
MO, USA). Equal amounts of cell protein (50 lg) were separated by
SDS–PAGE and analysed by Western blot using specific antibodies to
HMGB-1, IjB, phosphor-IjB-a, phosphor-NF-jB and proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, loading control). All antibodies were all
purchased from Abcam (Hong Kong, China). Optical densities of the
bands were scanned and quantified with a Gel Doc 2000 (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Milan, Italy). Data were normalized against those of the
corresponding PCNA bands. Results were expressed as fold increase
over control.
NF-jB-binding assay. SH-SY5Y cells (5 9 106) were pre-incubated
with ND01 10 lM for 22 hr, then incubated with TNF-a (20 ng/ml)
for 1 or 2 hr, then washed once with PBS, scraped cells into 1 ml
cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. Nuclear extracts were
prepared as described previously [12]. The DNA-binding activity of
NF-jB (p50/p65) was determined using an ELISA kit (Solar Biology
Technology Company, Shanghai, China).
Animals. Adult, male Sprague–Dawley rats (12 weeks, 280  20 g)
were obtained from Shandong Luye Pharmaceutical Company (Yantai,
China). All animals were housed individually at 22  2°C and a
relative humidity of 50  10% with a 12-hr light/dark cycle and with
free access to chow and water. All procedures (including rat cerebral
ischaemia study protocol) were carried out in accordance with the
National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23) revised 1996.
Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes model and rat cerebral
ischaemia study protocol. Two hundred rats (fasting for 20 hr) were
induced by single i.p. STZ at a dose of 50 mg/kg. STZ was diluted in
citrate buffer 0.1 M (pH 4.0). After STZ injection for 3 weeks, rats
with glycaemia value between 12.0 and 20.0 mM were used. The
diabetic rats were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, i.p.).
Rectal temperature was recorded and maintained at 37°C throughout
the surgical procedure. The operation of MCAO was carried out
according to previous procedures with minor modifications [13]. The
left common carotid artery was occluded, and the branches of the

external carotid artery were dissected and divided. The internal carotid
artery was followed rostrally, and a 4-0 filament (Beijing Shandong
Biology Company, Beijing, China; the diameter of the filament was
0.25, but the diameter of the tip was 0.34 mm to create a globular
stopper) was introduced into the internal carotid artery and advanced
until resistance was felt. The filament was removed after 30 min. The
rats were kept under conditions of controlled temperature (24–25°C)
for the first 23 hr after surgery.
A pilot study was conducted with four different doses of ND01 (10,
20, 40 or 80 mg/kg) to determine the dose-dependent effect in the
acute I/R-treated diabetic rats. It was observed that ND01 at doses of
20, 40 and 80 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05) lowered infarct volume
and neurological deficit scores of the acute I/R-induced diabetic rats
after 23 hr of the experiment. Hence, ND01 40 mg/kg was chosen for
this study.
For therapeutic time-window studies, 40 MCAO diabetic rats were
randomly divided into four groups of 10 rats each plus 10 diabetic
rats as control. Rats received dose of 40 mg/kg by intravenous bolus
injection into the tail vein 2, 4 and 6 hr after reperfusion. Vehicle-treated
rats were administered with saline. Neurological deficits were determined 23 hr after ischaemia followed by brain infarct examination.
For anti-inflammatory mechanism studies, 54 rats were randomly
divided into three subgroups of 18 rats each plus 18 rats as control
(non-diabetic). Rats received a dose of 40 mg/kg intravenous bolus
injection into the tail vein 30 min. after reperfusion. Diabetic or vehicle-treated rats were administered with saline. All the brain were evaluated by Evans blue extravasation, then analysed HMGB1, IjB,
phosphor-IjB-a, phosphor-NF-jB by Western blot and the histopathological damage were evaluated by NeuN staining, especially.
For long-term studies, 20 rats were randomly divided into two
groups of 10 rats each. Rats received a dose of 40 mg/kg by intravenous bolus injection into the tail vein 30 min. after reperfusion. The
vehicle-treated rats were administered with saline. Neurological deficits were determined on days 3, 7 and 14 after I/R. Fourteen days
after I/R, eight rats were stained in the ND01 40 mg/kg group, and
six rats were stained in the vehicle-treated group. The brain infarct
was examined according to a previous method [14].
Evaluation of neurological deficits. Neurological deficits were
evaluated using a modified six-point scoring method [15] by an
investigator who was blinded to each experimental group. The scale
used was as follows: 0, no neurological deficits (normal); 1, failure to
extend left forepaw fully (mild); 2, circling to the left (moderate); 3,
falling to the left (severe); 4, no spontaneous walking with a
depressed level of consciousness (very severe); and 5, death.
Evaluation of infarct volume. After 23 hr of reperfusion, all the rats
were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) through
intraperitoneal injection and the brain was quickly removed. The
starting site of brain was cut at forebrain 3 mm, and each brain was
sliced into five coronal sections of 2 mm thickness each, then stained
with a 2% solution of tetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma) in saline
at 37°C for 20 min. and photographed. Infarct volumes were
determined by quantitative image analysis with a Compix system
computer (C imaging 1280 system, Compix Inc., Cranberry Township,
PA, USA).
Evaluation of blood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage with Evans blue
extravasation. Determination of Evans blue extravasation was based
on a previous method [16] with minor modifications. After
reperfusion, 0.1 ml of 4% Evans blue (Urchem, Shanghai, China) in
0.9% saline was intravenously administered. Twenty-three hr after I/R,
rats were anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (340 mg/kg, i.p.) and then
perfused with 20 ml 10 U/ml heparinized saline to wash out the
blood. The brain was then isolated, weighed and homogenized in a

50% solution of trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation at 400 9 g
for 20 min., the supernatant was spectrophotometrically measured at
595 nm. Cerebral Evans blue was quantified as micrograms of dye per
gram of wet weight.
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity assay. The remaining slices of the
brain, not used for Western blot analysis, were used to determine
MPO activity as described previously [17]. For each individual rat, the
ischaemic and non-ischaemic hemispheres (from the six slices) were
pooled separately for the assay, and wet weight was then recorded.
The tissues were homogenized (1:20, wt/vol) in 5 mM phosphate
buffer (pH 6, 4°C) and centrifuged at 30,000 9 g for 30 min. (4°C).
MPO activity was determined according to the kit instructions (Xitang
Biology Technology Company, Shanghai, China). MPO activity for
each tissue sample is normalized based on grams per wet weight of
tissue.
NeuN staining. The left hemisphere of brain was cut coronally into
three blocks from the level of the optic chiasm and the
infundibular stem of the hypophysis. The middle block was further
cut into three subblocks. The middle subblock (0.1 9 0.1 cm2) was
embedded in paraffin. NeuN-immunolabeling was carried out
according to a previous method [18]. NeuN-immunopositive cells
were counted in three randomly selected fields (4009). The number
of NeuN-immunopositive cells was calculated by averaging the
three counts.
Statistical analysis. Neurological deficit scores between groups were
analysed using a non-parametric test. Quantitative data from the
experiments were expressed as mean  standard deviation (S.D.), and
the significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s test (SPSS 16.0, Beijing, PR China).
In all cases, differences were considered significant if p < 0.05.

Results
Effects of ND01 on NF-jB activation and HMGB-1
expression.
The NF-jB pathway plays a critical role in the secretion of
cytokines. The quantity of p50 and p65 was measured in the
nucleus. Stimulation with TNF-a led to a robust activation of
the NF-jB transcription factor p50/p65. However, this activation was partially blocked by ND01, as shown in fig. 1.
The IjB kinase system as another activation agent of NFjB was also examined. Stimulation with TNF-a resulted in a
marked degradation of IjB. This degradation was inhibited by
ND01 (fig. 2). In addition, the phosphorylation of p-IjB was
increased by TNF-a and also inhibited by ND01.
Phosphor-NF-jB expression was low in non-TNF-a-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. However, phosphor-NF-jB expression
was significantly increased after TNF-a 20 ng/ml-stimulated
SH-SY5Y cells for 120 min. We compared the effect of
ND01 on the TNF-a-induced activation of phosphor-NF-jB
and HMGB-1 expression level in the SH-SY5Y cells to that
of a selective HMGB-1 inhibitor, glycyrrhizin. The results of
fig. 2 showed that pre-treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with glycyrrhizin (100 lM) for 120 min., blocked the TNF-a-induced
HMGB-1 expression and reduced phosphorylation of NF-jB.
Pre-treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with ND01 10 lM blocked
TNF-a-induced NF-jB phosphorylation and reduced HMGB-1
expression, as shown in fig. 2.

SH-SY5Y cells at a concentration of 5 9 106 cells/ml were incubated
with complete medium, ND01 was added at 10 lM for 24 hr and then
stimulated with TNF-a (20 ng/ml) for 1 and 2 hr, and the DNA-binding
activity of p50/p65 was analysed by the ELISA kit. ND01 indicated
8-O-acetyl shanzhiside methylester. All data are expressed as
the mean  S.D., *p < 0.01 versus TNF-a 1 or 2 hr. Significance was
determined by one-way analysis of ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test.

Effects of ND01 on brain infarct volume and neurological
deficit scores in cerebral I/R rats.
Cerebral I/R injury leads to severe behavioural disturbance
and histological changes in the diabetic I/R rats. The results of
the therapeutic time-window study indicated that ND01 at a
dose of 40 mg/kg decreased neurological deficit scores,
reduced the brain infarct volume even with delayed administration at 2 and 4 hr after reperfusion. It was obvious that earlier administration of ND01 brought more therapeutic benefits,
as shown in fig. 3.
The results of the long-term study indicated that ND01 at a
dose of 40 mg/kg significantly decreased neurological deficit
scores and reduced cerebral infarction at 14 days after I/R, as
shown in table 1. The results of NeuN immunolabelling indicated that this is due to a significantly increased number of
surviving neurones at 23 hr and 14 days after cerebral I/R, as
shown in fig. 4. Thus, it was clear that early treatment with
ND01 provided long-term benefits for the neuronal functional
recovery after cerebral I/R.
Effects of ND01 on cerebral Evans blue extravasation in I/R
rats.
Evans blue extravasation was used to assess BBB breakdown
after cerebral ischaemia in the diabetic rats. Cerebral I/R injury
leads to higher Evans blue extravasation compared with the
diabetic rats. The results clearly showed that Evans blue
extravasation was significantly attenuated by ND01 treatment,
as shown in table 2.
Effects of ND01 on cerebral MPO activity, NF-jB activation
and HMGB-1 expression in I/R rats.
To investigate the molecular mechanism of ND01 cerebral
MPO activity, NF-jB activation and HMGB-1 expression
were examined. Cerebral MPO activity occurred highly in rats
after cerebral I/R 23 hr, but it was very weakly presented in
the diabetic animal, as shown in table 2. ND01 treatment

reduced MPO activity in cerebral tissue. Phosphorylation of
IjB-a and NF-jB both occurred highly in rats after cerebral I/
R, HMGB-1 expression also occurred highly, but they were
very weakly presented in the diabetic animals, as shown in
fig. 5. However, ND01 treatment not only reduced HMGB-1
expression but also decreased phosphorylated IjB-a and NFjB levels. These data indicated that ND01 inhibited inflammation response by reducing MPO activity, blocking NF-jB activation and HMGB-1 expression in diabetic cerebral I/R rats.
Discussion
In the present study, we observed that ND01 significantly
improved brain injury and did not reduce blood glucose in
diabetic rats subjected to cerebral I/R challenge, indicating that
ND01 has an immediate neuroprotective effect but not by
reducing blood glucose. Infarct size is the important indicator

of the pathophysiology to evaluate the efficacy of cerebral
ischaemia [19]. Our results (fig. 3) revealed that ND01 treatment produced significant reduction in the cerebral infarct volume in diabetic cerebral I/R rats even delayed administration
at 2 and 4 hr after I/R. Neuronal degeneration and necrosis
have been found to be correlated with deficits in behavioural
disturbance, and behavioural assessment may reveal effectiveness [20]. The present study showed that neurological scores
were reduced by treatment with ND01 (fig. 3). NeuN is a sensitive marker for injured neuron early after ischaemic challenge [21], and our data (fig. 4) demonstrate that ND01 at a
dose of 40 mg/kg attenuated the decrease in NeuN-immunopositive neurones in ischaemic cerebral cortex at 23 hr and
14 days after I/R. This indicates that ND01 has potential beneficial effects in the treatment of cerebral ischaemia.
The update of the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry
Roundtable Preclinical Recommendations [22] lists potential
reasons for failures in translating efficacious preclinical findings into successful clinical trial outcome. Consequently, we
investigate the therapeutic time-window and the long-term
efficacy of ND01 in the cerebral I/R diabetic rats, and our data
demonstrate that ND01 exerted potent and long-term neuroprotective effects with a favourable therapeutic time-window.
Stroke triggers an inflammatory reaction that progresses for
hours after the onset of the stroke, and this inflammation plays
a central role in the pathogenesis of neuronal injury in ischaemic stroke, especially in diabetic stroke [23]. Inflammatory
reactions contribute to the late stages of ischaemic injury and
worsened neurological outcome through the multiple mechanisms. DM is also an inflammatory disease [24]. The present
study indicates that ND01 had significant anti-inflammatory
effects (table 2 and fig. 5), and treatment with ND01 especially provides long-term benefits for neuronal functional
recovery after cerebral I/R (table 1). This suggests that the
neuroprotective effects of ND01 might be due to blocking of
the inflammatory response.

sham group, n = 5. *p < 0.01 versus vehicle-treated group. #p < 0.01
versus the diabetic group. Significance was determined by one-way
analysis of ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test.

MPO is considered an index of neutrophil infiltration and
highly expressed cerebral ischaemia at 24 hr. It shows that a
significant correlation between neutrophil infiltration and
infarct formation exists in a model of cerebral ischaemia [25].
Our results show that ND01 reduced MPO activity in diabetic
ischaemic cerebral tissue. This suggests that the neuroprotective effects of ND01 might be due to blocking of neutrophil
infiltration (table 2).
BBB permeability is significantly increased in diabetes due
to diabetes-induced damage to the BBB function and/or due to

the immature nature of the newly formed vessel [26]. BBB
breakdown also occurs in early-phase (within 24 hr) of cerebral ischaemia [27]. Our data demonstrate that ND01
improved diabetic cerebral I/R injury by attenuating BBB
breakdown.
NF-jB activation is associated with the phosphorylation of
IjB-a and NF-jB in ischaemic cerebral tissue. Reduction in
NF-jB activation can protect brain from activation of NF-jBdependent genes [28]. HMGB-1 is a novel player in the ischaemic brain [29]. Meanwhile, diabetes significantly increased
HMGB levels and induced worse functional outcome after
stroke compared with non-diabetic MCAO rats [30,31]. All
those data show HMGB-1 plays a key role in diabetic stroke.
The HMGB-1 signalling involves the activation of NF-jB
[32], an inhibitor of NF-jB kinase essential for HMGB-1 [33].
Suppression the release of HMGB-1 in astrocytes leads to the
attenuation of neuroinflammation and prevents the necrosis of
ischaemic astrocytes and NF-jB expression [34]. Inhibition of
the up-regulation of HMGB-1 and NF-jB at the early stage
brings great benefits to the diabetic cerebral ischaemia. Based
on the above findings, we explored the anti-inflammatory properties of ND01 in diabetic cerebral ischaemia and further studied the potential mechanisms. The up-regulation of HMGB-1
and NF-jB is significantly suppressed by ND01. These results
suggest that suppressing HMGB-1 and NF-jB expressions participated in the neuroprotection of ND01 against diabetic cerebral ischaemic damage. Therefore, we believe that the
protective effects of ND01 might be due to suppression of the
inflammatory cascades through HMGB-1-dependent NF-jB
signalling pathway.
In summary, the results of the current study suggest that
ND01 exhibits significant neuroprotective effects during
diabetic cerebral I/R injury, including attenuation of BBB
breakdown, decrease in the infarct volume, alleviation of cerebral damage, reduction in HMGB-1 expression, phosphorylated IjB-a and NF-jB expression in ischaemic brain tissue.
These effects of ND01 are correlated with inhibition of the
inflammatory response. These findings point to a therapeutic
potential for ND01 as a useful anti-inflammatory leads compound in early diabetic cerebral I/R injury.
