ABSTRACT
Remyelination is an important repair process after ischemic stroke-induced white matter injury. It
often fails because of the insufficient recruitment of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to the
demyelinated site or the inefficient differentiation of OPCs to oligodendrocytes. We investigated
whether CXCL12 gene therapy promoted remyelination after middle cerebral artery occlusion in
adult mice. The results showed that CXCL12 gene therapy at 1 week after ischemia could protect
myelin sheath integrity in the perifocal region, increase the number of platelet-derived growth
factor receptor-a (PDGFRa)-positive and PDGFRa/bromodeoxyuridine-double positive OPCs in
the subventricular zone, and further enhance their migration to the ischemic lesion area. Coadministration of AMD3100, the antagonist for CXCL12 receptor CXCR4, eliminated the beneficial
effect of CXCL12 on myelin sheath integrity and negatively influenced OPC proliferation and
migration. At 5 weeks after ischemia, CXCR4 was found on the PDGFRa- and/or neuron/glia type
2 (NG2)-positive OPCs but not on the myelin basic protein-positive mature myelin sheaths, and
CXCR7 was only expressed on the mature myelin sheath in the ischemic mouse brain. Our data
indicated that CXCL12 gene therapy effectively protected white matter and promoted its repair
after ischemic injury. The treatment at 1 week after ischemia is effective, suggesting that this strategy has a longer therapeutic time window than the treatments currently available. STEM CELLS

SIGNIFICANCE
This study has demonstrated for the first time that CXCL12 gene therapy significantly ameliorates
brain ischemia-induced white matter injury and promotes oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation in the subventricular zone and migration to the perifocal area in the ischemic mouse brain.
Additional data showed that CXCR4 receptor plays an important role during the proliferation and
migration of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and CXCR7 might play a role during maturation. In
contrast to many experimental studies that provide treatment before ischemic insult, CXCL12 gene
therapy was performed 1 week after brain ischemia, which significantly prolonged the therapeutic
time window of brain ischemia.

INTRODUCTION
Ischemic stroke leads to not only gray matter
injury but also white matter injury. Ischemia
induces the death of mature oligodendrocytes.
Pathological changes of oligodendrocytes and
myelinated axons appear as early as 30 minutes
after brain ischemia, indicating that white matter is highly vulnerable to ischemic attack [1].
This is possibly because blood flow in the white
matter is much lower than that in the gray matter and little collateral blood supply exists in the
deep white matter [1–3]. White matter injury
results from axonal injury induced by demyelination. Because myelin ensures fast nerve impulse

conduction and is necessary for the maintenance of the axonal cytoskeleton, the loss of
myelin or oligodendrocytes negatively influences axon integrity and signal transduction, even
in the presence of preserved neuronal integrity
[4–7].
Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) reside in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and can proliferate, migrate, and differentiate into mature
oligodendrocytes to repair the damaged myelin
sheaths during the process of remyelination [8,
9]. Efficient remyelination protects axons from
demyelination-associated axon loss [5]. The endogenous oligodendrogenesis and remyelination lasts up to several months in spinal cord

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Figure 1. Diagram of the experimental design. The mice underwent MCAO surgery at day 0 and received a stereotactic injection
of AAV-CXCL12 or AAV-GFP (as control). AMD3100 was injected
intraperitoneally from 2 weeks of ischemia. The mice were sacrificed at 3 and 5 weeks after ischemia. Abbreviations: AAV, adenoassociated virus; CXCL12, C-X-C chemokine ligand 12; d, day; GFP,

AAV-CXCL12 groups as a control for AMD3100. Bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) powder (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in normal saline
in a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The BrdU solution was injected
intraperitoneally at 50 mg/kg once a day for 7 consecutive days
at 2 and 4 weeks after MCAO. The mice were sacrificed and the
brains sectioned for immunohistochemistry at 3 and 5 weeks
after MCAO.

MCAO in Mice
A total of 47 adult male ICR mice (Sippr-BK, Shanghai, China,
http://www.slarc.org.cn/shlarc/website/root/) weighing 30 6
2 g were used in the present study. The mice were anesthetized
using ketamine/xylazine (100:10 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich). MCAO
was performed as described previously [22]. In brief, after isolation of the common carotid artery and external and internal carotid arteries, the left middle carotid artery was occluded by
inserting a blunt 6-0 nylon suture coated with silica gel. The body
temperature of the mice was maintained at 37°C throughout the
surgery using a thermal blanket. Successful occlusion was verified by the decrease of surface cerebral blood flow to less
than 15% of the baseline flow measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (Moor Instruments, Axminster, Devon, U.K., http://www.
moor.co.uk).

Experimental Protocol
Animal studies were reported in accordance with the Animal
Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments guidelines. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Jiao
Tong University (Shanghai, China) approved the procedure
for the use of laboratory animals. During the animal studies,
the guidelines for the regulation of the administration of affairs
concerning experimental animals of China enacted in 1988
were followed.
The experimental design is demonstrated in Figure 1. Adult
male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice received AAVCXCL12 or AAV-green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene transfer
at 1 week after MCAO. The viral vector constructs were identical
to those reported previously [19]. AMD3100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com), a CXCR4 antagonist,
was injected intraperitoneally 2 weeks after MCAO. AMD3100
was dissolved with normal saline to an injection concentration
of 0.3 mg/ml. The dose of AMD3100 was 1 mg/kg/day, sufficient
to block CXCR4 without causing stem cell mobilization [20, 21]. The
same amount of normal saline was also used in the AAV-GFP and

AAV-CXCL12 Viral Vector Injection
One week after MCAO, the mice were anesthetized as described in the previous section. The virus injection was performed, as described previously [19]. In brief, the mice were
immobilized on a stereotaxic apparatus (RWD Life Science,
Shenzhen, China, http://www.rwdstco.com), a linear skin incision was made over the bregma and a burr hole was drilled in
the skull at 2 mm lateral to the bregma using a handheld driller.
A 10-ml syringe (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL,
http://www.wpiinc.com) was slowly inserted into the brain
until reaching 3.5 mm under the dura and then slowly withdrawn for 1 mm. A total volume of 5 ml of saline solution containing 5 3 108 AAV-CXCL12 or AAV-GFP (as a control) viral
particles was injected stereotactically at a rate of 200 nl/min.
After finishing the injection, the needle was maintained still
for 20 minutes before withdrawal. The bone hole was sealed
with bone wax, and the wound was stitched. After awakening
from anesthesia, the mice were returned to their cages for longterm recovery.

injury-induced demyelination [10]. However, remyelination
often fails to ameliorate white matter injury because of limited recruitment of OPCs to the site of demyelination or unsuccessful OPC differentiation into oligodendrocytes [11]. These
previous findings suggested that promoting remyelination
is an important therapeutic strategy for the treatment of
ischemia-induced white matter injury.
C-X-C chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), also known as stromalderived factor-1 (SDF-1), is a chemokine known to regulate the migration, proliferation, and differentiation of neural progenitor cells
(NPCs) within the developing central nervous system (CNS). CXCL12
can bind with two receptors, CXCR4 and CXCR7. Increasing evidence
has shown that CXCL12 can recruit not only NPCs, but also other
types of endogenous stem/progenitor cells, such as endothelial
progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and hematopoietic
stem cells, mainly by interacting with CXCR4 [12–14]. Through
binding with CXCR4, CXCL12 regulates the survival and outward
chemotactic migration of OPCs during embryonic and postnatal
CNS myelination [15, 16]. In the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, CXCR4 signaling was found to promote the differentiation of OPCs and remyelination [17]. In vitro studies
showed that CXCL12 could also promote the proliferation of
OPCs [16, 18].
Our previous study has shown that CXCL12 gene therapy
promoted angiogenesis and neurogenesis after brain ischemia
[19]. However, to date, no studies have been done to elucidate
the effect of CXCL12 in the repair of ischemia-induced demyelination. In the present study, we characterized the expression
pattern of endogenous CXCL12 during the acute and subacute
phases after brain ischemia. Next, we used adeno-associated
virus (AAV) to mediate CXCL12 gene transfer to the ischemic
perifocal area at 1 week after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). We examined whether CXCL12 gene expression protected myelin sheath integrity or promoted the proliferation
and migration of OPCs, and we also examined the expression of receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 in OPCs and mature
oligodendrocytes.

Immunohistochemistry

MBP staining intensity was computed as the mean integrated optical density (IOD), as previously described [23]. In brief, microphotographs were taken using a 35 objective lens (DM2500;
Leica Microsystems). The fluorescence images were first converted to binary images with inverted color. Next, the images
were automatically analyzed by the pathology function of the Image Pro Plus, version 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD,
http://www.mediacy.com) for quantitative IOD calculation. Brain
sections incubated without the primary antibody were used to
estimate the background staining. Four serial sections, spaced
400 mm apart, were selected from each of the 3 mice in each
group. The results are presented as the IOD ratio of the ipsilateral/
contralateral hemisphere.

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Analysis
The mice were anesthetized by injection of ketamine/xylazine intraperitoneally. The brain was quickly removed to a cooled brain
mold and cut into 4 sections by 3 blades that were 2 mm apart.
The second rostral section that included the ischemic core was collected. The protein extracted from ipsilateral striatum was used for
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. The protein
levels of CXCL12 were quantified using an ELISA kit (Mouse SDF-1a
ELISA Kit; RayBiotech, Norcross, GA, http://www.raybiotech.com)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Readings from each
sample were normalized for the protein concentration.

PDGFRa and BrdU Double Staining

Statistical Analysis

Floating coronal sections were first treated with 2 mol/liter HCl
for 30 minutes at 37°C and then neutralized twice with sodium
borate for 10 minutes each. The sections were then treated with
0.3% Triton-100 in PBS for 30 minutes, blocked by 5% normal
donkey serum, incubated with anti-BrdU (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, http://www.scbt.com) and antiPDGFRa (1:200), antibody at 4°C overnight. Finally, the sections
were incubated with proper secondary antibodies for 60 minutes
at room temperature. The stained sections were mounted after
rinsing.

The parametric data from different groups were compared using
a one-way analysis of variance followed by the Student-NewmanKeuls test using GraphPad Prism, version 3.05 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, http://www.graphpad.com). All data were
presented as the mean 6 SD. A probability value of p , .05 was
considered statistically significant.

PDGFRa+ OPCs and PDGFRa+/BrdU+ Cell Counting
The sections were imaged under the same conditions, and the
cells were counted and quantified by an investigator who was unaware of the experimental design. Four serial sections, spaced
400 mm apart (bregma 1.10 mm to 20.10 mm), were selected
from each mouse. Positive cells were counted from a single optical fraction in 4–6 sections for each mouse. Each group included
three mice.
For PDGFRa+ cell counting, 6 fields were randomly selected
from perifocal region under a 320 objective lens. PDGFRa+ cells
in the SVZ were counted for each image (DM2500; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany, http://www.leica-microsystems.
com). For PDGFRa+/BrdU+ cell counting, 4 fields were randomly
selected from the perifocal region under a 340 objective lens
(TCS SP5II; Leica Microsystems). PDGFRa+/BrdU+ cells in the
SVZ were counted for each image. The numbers were averaged,
and the data were presented as numbers of positive cells per
microfield.

RESULTS
Endogenous CXCL12 Expression Profile Varies in Acute
and Postacute Phases of Ischemic Mouse Brain
To identify the types of cells that express CXCL12 during the acute
and postacute phases of the ischemic mouse brain, double immunostaining was performed. The results showed that CXCL12 was only
expressed by CD31+ microvessels in the sham mouse brain (Fig. 2A,
left column). In contrast, CXCL12 was expressed, not only by CD31+
microvessels, but also by NeuN+ neurons, GFAP+ astrocytes, and
Iba1+ microglia in the 3-day postischemic mouse brain (Fig. 2A,
middle column). CXCL12 was no longer detected in GFAP+ astrocytes in the 14-day postischemic mouse brain but was still present
in the microvessels and neurons (Fig. 2A, right column). Lower magnification images showed that Iba1+ microglia was not detectable
in the sham or 14-day postischemic mouse brain but were abundant in the 3-day postischemic mouse brain (Fig. 2Ap–Ar). CXCL12
was found to colocalize with Iba1+ microglia in the 3-day postischemic mouse brain (Fig. 2An). To quantify endogenous CXCL12 expression after stroke onset, we examined CXCL12 expression at
1 hour and 1, 3, 7, and 14 days (Fig. 2B). CXCL12 protein expression
peaked at 1 day after ischemia and started to decrease after
3 days of ischemia.

The mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and transcardially perfused first with normal saline and then with freshly
prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in normal saline. The brains
were postfixed for 4–5 hours, followed by 24 hours of immersion in 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and frozen before being sectioned using a cryostat (Leica Biosystems,
Solms, Germany, http://www.leicabiosystems.com); 20-mmthick coronal sections were cut. Immunohistochemistry was
performed according to the protocol described previously
[19]. Care was taken to sample sections at similar anatomical
levels. Floating coronal sections were treated with 0.3%
Triton-100 in PBS for 30 minutes, blocked by 5% normal donkey
serum, incubated with primary antibodies at the following dilutions: CXCR4 (1:100 dilution) and myelin basic protein (MBP;
1:300 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, http://www.abcam.
com), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuronal nuclei protein (NeuN), ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1),
platelet-derived growth factor-a (PDGFRa), and neuron/glia
type 2 (NG2; 1:100 dilution; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA,
http://www.emdmillipore.com), CD31 (1:200 dilution; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, http://www.rndsystems.com) at 4°C
overnight. Finally, the sections were incubated with proper biotinylated or fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. The
stained sections were mounted after thorough rinsing. For biotinylated immunostaining, the brain sections were developed for
the same amount of time.

CXCL12 Gene Expression Protects Myelin
Sheath Integrity
The successful expression of exogenous CXCL12 mediated by
gene therapy was confirmed in our previous study [19]. To determine whether CXCL12 gene therapy can protect white matter integrity, MBP immunostaining for myelin basic protein was
performed. After ischemia, many lesions were formed around
the perifocal area, resulting in serious damage to striatum white
matter axons and a breakdown of neurofilaments in the ipsilateral
hemisphere (Fig. 3A, 3B). The striatum white matter was maintained morphologically intact in the contralateral hemisphere
(Fig. 3C). As an indicator of white matter integrity, the ratio of
MBP intensity of the ipsilateral compared with the contralateral
hemispheres in the CXCL12 gene therapy group was significantly
higher than that of the GFP control group at 5 weeks after ischemia (Fig. 3D). Continuous coadministration of AMD3100 that
blocks CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway profoundly diminished
the beneficial effect of CXCL12 gene therapy in protecting myelin
sheath integrity (Fig. 3D).

Postacute CXCL12 Gene Expression Promotes OPC
Proliferation and Migration
We examined the brain sections of mice that were sacrificed at
3 and 5 weeks after ischemia. The results showed that the numbers
of PDGFRa+ cells and PDGFRa+/BrdU+ cells in the SVZ were augmented in the CXCL12 gene therapy group compared with AAVGFP control group (Fig. 4A, 4B, 4D). Parallel with that, the numbers
of PDGFRa+ cells and PDGFRa+/BrdU+ cells in the perifocal area
were also significantly increased in the CXCL12 gene therapy
group (Fig. 4A, 4C, 4E). Because CXCR4 is expressed on OPCs,
the role of CXCR4 in OPC proliferation and migration was determined by treating CXCL12 gene expression in ischemic mice
with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 [20, 21]. Continuous

©AlphaMed Press 2015

coadministration of AMD3100 for 1 or 3 weeks, starting from
2 weeks after ischemia, eliminated the beneficial effect of
CXCL12 on increasing the number of PDGFRa+ cells and
PDGFRa+/BrdU+ cells in the SVZ (Fig. 4A, 4B, 4D) and perifocal
area (Fig. 4A, 4C, 4E).

CXCR4 Was Found on OPCs but not on Mature Myelin
Sheaths, and CXCR7 Was Found Only on Mature
Myelin Sheaths
To probe the specific roles of receptors for CXCL12 during the
process of OPC proliferation, migration, and maturation, we
examined the expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7. Confocal
images showed that CXCR4 was expressed by PDGFRa+ and
NG2 + OPCs (Fig. 5A). PDGFRa+ /NG2 + double-positive OPCs
also expressed CXCR4 (Fig. 5B). However, CXCR4 could not
be found on the MBP + mature myelin sheath (Fig. 5C). In contrast to the expression pattern of CXCR4, the other receptor
of CXCL12, CXCR7, was barely found on the surface of the
OPCs (Fig. 6A) but was observed on mature myelin sheaths
(Fig. 6B).

DISCUSSION
The results that showed the success of AAV-CXCL12 transduction in the mouse brain were reported in our previous
study [19]. The expression of CXCL12 can be observed at
1 week and lasts at least 8 weeks after gene transfer based
on the GFP fluorescent signal. AAV-CXCL12 mainly transfected neurons and astrocytes but not endothelial cells in
the brain. ELISA quantification of CXCL12 has shown that
CXCL12 protein significantly increased after 4 weeks of gene
transfer. Intraperitoneal injection of AMD3100 does not influence the expression of CXCL12 protein [19]. Based on

these data, AAV-CXCL12 gene therapy applied in mice at
1 week after MCAO was used to examine whether it can protect against white matter injury, because the mice that underwent MCAO surgery presented obvious myelin sheath
degradation in our study. The data showed that CXCL12 gene
therapy significantly ameliorated white matter injury and promoted the proliferation and migration of OPCs. Blocking
CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling by AMD3100 essentially eliminated
the benefit of CXCL12 gene therapy. Further study showed that
CXCR4 receptor was mainly expressed on OPCs, but not on mature oligodendrocytes, and CXCR7 receptor was only found on
mature oligodendrocytes.

The expression pattern of CXCL12 during the acute and postacute phases after ischemia was very different, not only in the expression level, but also in the cellular source. Activated astrocytes
and microglials are key inflammatory components to ischemic injury during the acute phase [24–26]. CXCL12 is secreted by all major cell types in the brain, namely neurons, astrocytes, microglia,
and endothelial cells, and probably plays a role in the acute inflammation response. It has been shown that blocking CXCL12 signaling with AMD3100 in the acute phase significantly reduced
acute inflammation [22]. CXCL12 expression in the acute phase
is involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the ischemic boundary [22, 27]. However, CXCL12 can also recruit many

kinds of stem/progenitor cells, such as neural stem cells and bone
marrow stem cells, to the injured area to repair damage [28–30].
In the postacute phase, CXCL12 secreted by neurons and endothelial cells might promote brain repair by enhancing the recruitment of endogenous progenitor cells. The detailed functions of
CXCL12 in different cells remain to be fully elucidated with further
investigation.
Loss of myelin sheath integrity negatively influences
neurological function [6, 7]; thus, ischemia-induced demyelination requires attention during the search of efficient therapeutic treatment for stroke. Remyelination of demyelinated
axons requires the appropriate proliferation, migration, and
maturation of OPCs, which reside in SVZ, distant from white
matter injury areas within the ischemic mouse brain. Chemokines, which regulate these processes during development,
are therefore critical elements of the intrinsic ischemic brain

injury response. Upregulation of these genes induced by ischemia
might represent the brain’s effort in repairing itself. Our previous study has shown that CXCL12 gene therapy in the postacute phase significantly reduced brain atrophy and improved
neurobehavioral recovery in ischemic mice [19]. In the present study, we further showed that CXCL12 gene therapy protected myelin sheath integrity and promoted the proliferation
of PDGFRa+ OPCs in the SVZ and OPC migration to the perifocal
area.
Our data indicate that CXCL12 gene expression in the perifocal area at 1 week after ischemia is beneficial for the preservation
of white matter integrity within the striatum and the proliferation
and migration of OPCs into demyelinated lesions in vivo. The primary
receptor for CXCL12, CXCR4, is expressed by PDGFRa+ and/or
NG2+ OPCs in the 5-week ischemic mouse brain and both of these
OPCs have been validated for their remyelination ability [31–34].
However, CXCR4 can rarely be found on MBP+ mature myelin
sheaths, suggesting that CXCR4 expression might modulate OPC
proliferation and migration and is downregulated after fulfilling
its duty when OPCs maturate into oligodendrocytes [15, 35].
Blocking CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling pathway with AMD3100
abrogated the beneficial effect of CXCL12 gene therapy in
protecting striatum white matter integrity at 5 weeks after
ischemia and decreased the number of PDGFRa+ OPCs in
the SVZ and perifocal area in the 3-week ischemic brain. More
damage from the white matter injury was observed in AMD3100treated mice than in the AAV-GFP group at 3 weeks of ischemia.
This might have been because AMD3100 inhibited the binding of
both endogenous and exogenous CXCL12 with CXCR4. Because

the perifocal region of the injured striatum protected myelin
sheath integrity and enhanced the proliferation and migration
of OPCs, suggesting that CXCL12 and/or its receptors could be
promising therapeutic candidates to promote recovery from
ischemia-induced demyelination.

endogenous CXCL12 plays a beneficial role in this phase, blocking
its binding with CXCR4 would further exacerbate the injury.
In the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, CXCL12/
CXCR4 signaling was found to regulate OPC proliferation and maturation but did not affect OPC migration from the SVZ into the
corpus callosum [36]. In the mouse hepatitis virus-induced intracranial infection demyelinating disease model, CXCL12/CXCR4
contributes to the maturation of OPCs, and administration of
AMD3100 increases the number of OPCs [37]. Our data have demonstrated that CXCL12/CXCR4 is important for OPC proliferation
and migration. These differences observed in different studies
suggest that CXCL12/CXCR4 might function differently in different disease models.
The receptor CXCR7 was abundant on MBP+ mature myelin
sheaths but was hardly detected on PDGFRa+ OPCs in the 5-week
ischemic mouse brain, which might suggest that CXCR7 plays
a part only in the process of OPC maturation. During cuprizoneinduced demyelination, CXCR7 was expressed on OPCs, and CXCR7
antagonism augmented OPC proliferation [38]. Cuprizone-induced
demyelination is closely associated with inflammation. However,
during the postacute ischemic phase, inflammation is much less significant. This difference might account for the different observations regarding CXCR7 expression on OPCs in different models.
Further studies using CXCR7 inhibitor in murine ischemic models
would help reveal information on its role in promoting OPC
maturation.
