NEW & NOTEWORTHY

Chloride intracellular channel-4 (CLIC4) is not required for
embryonic collateral arteriole formation in the brain but is
required for perinatal collateral maturation. Vegfa overexpression in CLIC4-deficient mice partially rescues deficits in perinatal collateral mural cell investment, and fully rescues aberrant perinatal collateral pruning and enlarged infarct volume
after stroke in adults.
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE and stroke are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developed countries, and together claim
annually ⬃800,000 lives in the US (28). Native (preexisting)
collaterals in tissues limit the severity of ischemic tissue
damage (24, 34, 35). These arteriole-to-arteriole anastomoses
connect adjacent arterial trees and provide alternative routes

for perfusion if the trunk or major branch of one of the trees
becomes obstructed. In the cerebral cortex, collaterals reside
within the pia mater and interconnect the middle, anterior, and
posterior cerebral artery (MCA, ACA, PCA) trees. The number
and diameter (“extent”) of native collaterals in brain and other
tissues varies widely among different inbred strains of healthy
adult mice due to genetic polymorphisms, resulting in large
differences in tissue injury in models of stroke and ischemic
disease (33). Collateral-dependent perfusion also varies widely
among humans with similar impact, although the sources of
this variation remain unclear (24, 34, 35).
Despite their importance, relatively little is known about
how native collaterals form. By embryonic (E) day 12.5 in
mice, the nascent MCA tree has begun to form from remodeling of the cerebral plexus (5). Pial collaterals subsequently
begin to appear between the distal branches of the MCA and
ACA trees as the latter’s branches emerge from the central
sulcus at approximately E14.5 (21). At this time, the trunk and
major branches of the MCA tree are well-formed and most of
the distal-most arterioles in its crown turn and penetrate into
the parenchyma. A small fraction of these arterioles form
angiogenic-like sprouts just before turning downward. These
sprouts migrate across the underlying pial capillary plexus as
an endothelial cell (EC) cord and fuse with a distal arteriole of
the opposing arterial tree, followed by lumen formation within
the cord (21). This process of collaterogenesis ends near E18.5
(5, 21). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying it are
undoubtedly complex, details are emerging: Collaterogenesis
involves paracrine vascular endothelial growth factor-A
(VEGF-A) signaling via VEGFR2 and the VEGFR2-Notch
signaling pathway (21). Knockdown of non-endothelial Vegfa,
global Flk1, Adam10, or inhibition of gamma-secretase activity
prior to collaterogenesis reduce collateral formation without
affecting overall cerebral vascular architecture. Furthermore,
these embryos never recover collateral number, resulting in
deficiency in adulthood and worse stroke.
The number of collaterals that form during collaterogenesis
is the major determinant of the number present in the adult.
However, a second process, postnatal maturation, also contributes. Maturation extends from E18.5 through approximately
postnatal day (P) 21, depending on mouse strain, and consists
of a pruning away of a percentage of the nascent collaterals (5,
10). Those that remain undergo wall maturation, increase their
diameter and length, and begin to acquire their characteristic
tortuosity.
Chloride intracellular channel-4 (CLIC4) is a member of a
7-membrane-spanning family of proteins (CLICs), and is one
of two members expressed in ECs and other vascular wall
cells, the other being CLIC1 which when deleted has no effect
on collaterogenesis or collateral maturation (8). Usually resid-

is required for maturation of the cerebral collateral circulation. Am J
Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 309: H1141–H1150, 2015. First published
August 14, 2015; doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00451.2015.—The number
and diameter of native collaterals in tissues of healthy mice vary
widely, resulting in large differences in tissue injury in occlusive
diseases. Recent studies suggest similar variation may exist in humans. Collateral variation in mice is determined by genetic background-dependent differences in embryonic collateral formation, by
variation in maturation of the nascent collaterals, and by environmental factors such as aging that cause collateral rarefaction in the adult.
Recently, formation of the collateral circulation in the brain was found
to involve a unique VEGF-A-dependent “arteriolar” angiogenic
sprouting-like mechanism. Elsewhere, chloride intracellular protein 4
(CLIC4) was implicated but not investigated directly, prompting the
present study. Deletion of Clic4 had no effect on embryonic collaterogenesis. However, during collateral maturation from embryonic
day 18.5 to postnatal day 7, reduced mural cell investment was
observed and excessive pruning of collaterals occurred. Growth in
collateral diameter was reduced. This resulted in 50% fewer collaterals of smaller diameter in the adult and thus larger infarct volume after
middle cerebral artery occlusion. During collateral maturation, CLIC4
deficiency resulted in reduced expression of Vegfr2, Vegfr1, Vegfc,
and mural cell markers, but not notch-pathway genes. Overexpression
of VEGF-A in Clic4⫺/⫺ mice had no effect on collaterogenesis, but
rescued the above defects in collateral maturation by preventing mural
cell loss and collateral pruning, thus restoring collateral number and
diameter and reducing stroke severity in the adult. CLIC4 is not
required for collaterogenesis but is essential for perinatal maturation
of nascent collaterals through a mechanism that supports VEGF
signaling.

CLIC4 REGULATES MATURATION OF CEREBRAL COLLATERALS

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals
Clic4⫺/⫺ mice originally generated on a CD1 background were
backcrossed at least 8 generations to C57BL/6 (Charles River Laboratories no. 027). After further outcrossing to C57BL/6J (Jackson
Laboratory no. 00664), heterozygous F1 progeny were intercrossed to
produce related wild-type (WT) (Clic4⫹/⫹) and knockout (Clic4⫺/⫺)
lines. Separate Clic4⫺/⫺ were crossed to CD1 mice that overexpress
Vegfa (Vegf hi/⫹) (26) to create Clic4⫺/⫺;Vegf hi/⫹ mice on a mixed
C57BL/6J.CD1 background. Littermate Clic4⫺/⫺;Vegf⫹/⫹ and F2
C57BL/6J.CD1 served as CLIC4 knockout and WT controls, respectively. All experiments were approved by the University of North
Carolina IACUC and performed in accordance with NIH guidelines.
Pial Collateral Morphometrics
P7-adult mice. After anesthesia with ketamine (100 mg/kg) and
xylazine (10 mg/kg), the thoracic aorta was cannulated retrograde and
the cortical pial circulation exposed via craniotomy. The vasculature
was perfused with heparinized saline containing 40 ␮g/ml papaverine
and 30 ␮g/ml sodium nitroprusside to fully dilate vessels, followed by
a small bolus of Evans Blue (50 mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline)
to stain vessel lumens. Yellow Microfil (FlowTech, Carver, MA) was
then injected and allowed to cure. Brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight and imaged with a stereomicroscope.
Embryos. Fragile embryonic pial collaterals cannot be reliably
filled using opaque filling agent, and thus we used immunohistochemistry to identify them. Since this does not permit identification of
lumen diameter, the latter is not reported in embryos. Staged embryonic brains were fixed in 2– 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton-X, blocked with 5% donkey serum in PBS, and exposed to
anti-CD31 (1:300, BD no. 550274). Brains were rinsed and exposed
to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, no. 111-065-144), horserad-

ish peroxidase (Vectastain RTU no. PK-7800, Vector Laboratories),
DAB (SK-4100, Vector), and DAB Enhancing solution (H-2200)
following the manufacturer instructions. Pial collaterals interconnecting the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery
(ACA) trees were identified and counted. Measurements were obtained blindly.
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
A 4-mm incision was made just caudal to the right eye and the
temporal muscle was retracted. A 2-mm2 craniotomy was drilled
(18000-17, FST, Foster City, CA) over the MCA trunk, which was
cauterized (18010-00, FST, modified). The temporal muscle was
reseated and the incision closed. The brain was removed 24 h later and
sliced into 1-mm coronal sections that were incubated in a 2%
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in PBS at 37°C. Sections
were coded to blind the investigator to genotype and imaged with a
stereomicroscope (MZ16FA, Leica). Neocortical area and area devoid
of TTC staining (infarct area) were measured (ImageJ) for each
section, summed, and percent infarct volume of neocortex volume
calculated.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Tissues were stored in RNA later (Sigma no. R0901) and pooled to
produce one sample containing at least 6 embryos from at least 3
unrelated litters. Total RNA was isolated from the pia mater overlying
the E18.5 dorsolateral collateral zone (see Ref. 21) or whole cortex.
Reverse transcription was performed with SuperScript First-Strand
Synthesis System (Invitrogen, no. 11904-018) following manufacturer
instructions. Amplification was achieved with SYBR Green JumpStart
Taq ReadyMix (Sigma, no. S4438) using StepOnePlus (AB Biosciences) and analyzed using the delta-delta CT method and StepOnePlus software. Gene expression was normalized to endogenous ␤-actin expression. Samples were analyzed in triplicate, and data from 3– 4
RT-PCR samples were averaged.
Immunohistochemistry
Brains were fixed in 4% PFA and digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma, no. C0130), and 100 ␮g/␮l proteinase K (Qiagen, no.
19131) in PBS at 37°C for 20 min. Brains were permeabilized with
0.05% Triton (4°C overnight), blocked and exposed to anti-collagen
IV (1:200, Millipore, no. AB756P) anti-VE-cadherin (1:300, BD, no.
55048) or anti-smooth muscle actin (SMA 1:300, Millipore no.
04 –1094) at 4°C overnight. For confocal microscopy (Zeiss 510),
vessels were secondarily stained using Alexafluor-conjugated antibodies and the pia mater was gently separated from the cortex and
mounted on slides. For smooth muscle actin quantification, the superficial cortex was dissected from the brain, gently weighted flat in a
coverslip-bottom chamber and imaged (Lab-Tek no. 155380). For
light microscopy, vessels were secondarily stained using biotin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and DAB.
Aortic Ring Angiogenesis Assay
Six 0.5-mm thoracic aortic rings from each 4- to 6-wk-old mouse
were serum-starved in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, no. 31985-070)
for 24 h and plated in 75 ␮l collagen type 1 (Millipore no. 08 –115)
(modified from Ref. 2). On day 6, rings were fixed and stained with
anti-VE-cadherin (1:300, BD, no. 55048) and an AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary. Sprout counts were obtained live on blinded samples
using a dissecting microscope, and sprout length was determined
using ImageJ.
Statistics
Values (means ⫾ SE) were tested with independent t-tests or
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni analysis (SPSS; PASW Statistics
18) with significance set at P ⬍ 0.05.

ing in the cytoplasm, CLIC4 can also be found in the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus and plasma membrane, and translocates between compartments (3, 22, 31, 37,
39), including to the nucleus during metabolic stress, growth
arrest, apoptosis, and TGF␤ signaling (40). Several studies
have begun to define vascular functions of CLIC4. Knockdown
of CLIC4 in vitro impairs EC proliferation and formation of
EC cords, intracellular vacuoles, and the tubular plexus (42,
43). In vivo, CLIC4 deletion disrupts matrigel and ischemiainduced neoangiogenesis (3, 42, 43). We previously uncovered
a possible role for CLIC4 in collaterogenesis and showed that
deficiency causes reduction of collateral extent in the adult
brain and hindlimb resulting in worse ischemic injury, while
not affecting the general arterial-venous circulation (6).
The purpose of the present study was to determine the role
of CLIC4 in cerebral collaterogenesis. Deletion of CLIC4 had
no effect on embryonic collateral formation. However, deficiency impaired mural cell recruitment and caused extensive
collateral pruning between E18.5 and P7, which resulted in
reduced number and smaller diameter of collaterals in the adult
and thus more severe strokes. Overexpression of Vegfa in
Clic4⫺/⫺ mice completely prevented these defects and partially
restored P4 collateral mural cell coverage. Isolated pial membranes from P4 and P7 Clic4⫺/⫺ mice had reduced expression
of Vegfa pathway and mural cell genes. These findings provide
a link between CLIC4 and VEGF signaling in vivo and
establish that CLIC4 is required for perinatal pial mural cell
investment and collateral maturation.

RESULTS

CLIC4 Deficiency Impairs Collateral Maturation but Not
Collaterogenesis

VEGF-A Overexpression Prevents Collateral Pruning in
Clic4⫺/⫺ Mice

CLIC4 Deletion Does Not Affect Endothelial Cell Sprouting

VEGF-A induces EC sprout formation and promotes vascular maturation. In the cerebral vasculature, prolonged exposure
to VEGF-A increases microvascular pericyte coverage and
expression of the EC-pericyte junctional protein N-cadherin
(45). To test whether VEGF-A overexpression could restore
collateral maturation in Clic4⫺/⫺ mice, we crossed Clic4⫺/⫺
with Vegfa-overexpressing mice to create Clic4⫺/⫺;Vegfhi/⫹
mice on a mixed C57BL/6-CD1 background. Isolated E18.5
pial meninges in CLIC4-deficient embryos indeed expressed
less Vegfa than control mice, and levels were restored but not
inflated by Vegfa overexpression. (Fig. 2A). Whole cortex
homogenate showed no difference in Vegfa expression between the groups and may reflect tight compensatory Vegfa
regulation in developing cortical neurons (Fig. 2B).

CLIC4 is required for normal tube formation, network
branching and cell sprouting in isolated ECs in vitro and in
tumor invasion and retinal growth assays in vivo (42, 43).
Since collaterals are known to form by a sprouting-like mechanism from preexisting arterioles (21), we sought to determine
if CLIC4 has a role in sprouting angiogenesis. Since there is no
in vitro model of collateral formation, we used the aortic ring
assay because it encompasses a complete “vascular niche” of
interacting cell types and can be harvested from mice of
different backgrounds and targeted genes. Background strain is
known to affect angiogenic and collaterogenic potential (e.g.,
4, 19, 32), and thus the aortic ring assay controls for any
variation in pure C57BL/6 and mixed C57BL/6 ⫻ CD1 strains.

To determine if CLIC4 deficiency in C57BL/6 mice affects
collateral formation, we used immunohistochemistry to identify pial collaterals at E16.5 and E18.5. Embryonic arteries
cannot be reliably filled with opaque solutions because they
rupture under pressure. Thus lumen diameter, which is easily
measured in the adult, cannot be reliably measured in embryos.
Collateral number in Clic4⫺/⫺ mice was similar to WT at both
E16.5 and E18.5 (Fig. 1, A and B). We then examined collateral number and diameter in P7, P14, and adult mice after
infusion of Microfil. Wild-type collateral number peaked at
E18.5 and then declined slightly with pruning, consistent with
previous reports (Fig. 1B) (5, 7). In contrast, Clic4⫺/⫺ mice
lost ⬃50% of their collaterals between E18.5 and P7, resulting
in reduced number in the adult. Collateral diameter was smaller
in Clic4⫺/⫺ mice at all postnatal stages (Fig. 1C), consistent
with our previous report for Clic4⫺/⫺ mice on an outbred
CD1-background (6). These results show that CLIC4 deletion
has no effect on collateral formation but facilitates their pruning and, of the ones remaining, a failure to enlarge to normal
diameter.

Vegfa-overexpression in Clic4⫺/⫺ embryos did not alter
collateral number at E18.5 (Fig. 2C). Consistent with Fig. 1,
the mixed-background Clic4⫺/⫺ mice lost ⬃50% of their
collaterals between E18.5 and P7, and collateral number and
diameter remained similarly low in adults (Fig. 2, B and C). In
contrast to their Clic4⫺/⫺ littermates, Clic4⫺/⫺;Vegfhi/⫹ mice
did not lose collaterals; thus collateral number and diameter
remained similar to WT in adults.
To confirm that existing collaterals pruned in Clic4⫺/⫺ mice,
we looked for evidence of “empty” vessel sheaths in the pia
mater. Nascent vessels are known to secrete an extracellular
matrix consisting predominantly of collagen IV that persists for
weeks as an empty sheath after pruning. We immunostained
isolated P4 pia mater for the EC marker VE-cadherin and
collagen IV and all distal arteriolar-arteriolar collagen IVpositive/VE-cadherin-negative segments were counted. These
sheaths were rare in WT, but present in every Clic4⫺/⫺ pial
membrane examined (Fig. 2E). When they did occur in
Clic4⫺/⫺ mice, the sheaths were almost exclusively located at
the point of fusion with a larger opposing branch (Fig. 2E,
arrows). The tapered appearance may be from stretching due to
rapid growth of the neocortex at this time. The number of
Clic4⫺/⫺;Vegfhi/⫹ sheaths was similar to WT (Fig. 2D) and is
consistent with Fig. 2B showing no collateral pruning in this
group.

C57BL/6 WT and Clic4⫺/⫺ mice (Fig. 3A), and the mixedbackground WT and Clic4⫺/⫺ mice (Fig. 3B). However, sprout
number and length were larger in Clic4⫺/⫺;Vegfhi/⫹ rings, even
though we did not see an increase in collaterals in Clic4⫺/⫺;
Vegfhi/⫹ embryos. These results suggest that angiogenic sprouting potential may contribute to, but is not required for, collaterogenesis.
Overexpression of VEGF-A Prevents Worse Stroke After
MCA Occlusion in Clic4⫺/⫺ Mice
Differences in native collateral number and diameter closely
correlate with (6, 7, 15, 33), indeed are causal for (33),
differences in infarct volume. To determine if collateral number and diameter that were “rescued” by VEGF-A overexpression in Clic4⫺/⫺;Vegfhi/⫹ mice (Fig. 2) protects against ischemic damage, we performed MCA occlusion in mixed-background WT, Clic4⫺/⫺ and Clic4⫺/⫺;Vegfhi/⫹ adult mice.
Twenty-four hours after MCA occlusion, Clic4⫺/⫺ had ⬃3fold larger infarctions than WT mice (Fig. 4), confirming a
previous report using CD1-background mice (6). In contrast,
infarct volume in Clic4⫺/⫺;Vegfhi/⫹ mice was reduced to that

in WT. Thus failure of proper collateral maturation in Clic4⫺/⫺
mice (Figs. 1 and 2) causes larger infarctions, and both deficiencies are prevented by increasing VEGF-A expression.
Gene Expression Supports CLIC4 Requirement for
Maturation of Nascent Collaterals
To determine if impaired pial collateral maturation is reflected in changes in expression of genes involved in stabilization, muralization, and growth of nascent vessels, the pial
collateral zone [area of the pial membrane containing collaterals and distal branches of the ACA, MCA and PCA (Fig.
5A)] was harvested from P4 and P7 mice. We used C57BL/
6-WT and Clic4⫺/⫺ mice to avoid variability associated with
crossing to an outbred strain (CD1). Expression of VEGFR1,
VEGFR2 and VEGF-C were decreased in Clic4⫺/⫺ mice while
at P4, ADAM10 was significantly increased (Fig. 5B). Mural
cell markers desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA) and the
smooth muscle-EC adhesion molecule N-cadherin were all
lower at P7; angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), associated with vessel
stabilization, trended lower. Other genes also associated with
vessel maturation (Dll4, Hey1, Hes1, Notch1, Tgf␤1, Tgf␤r2,

collateral is already smaller in diameter with less SMA coverage
in P4 Clic4⫺/⫺ pups (Fig. 6, E and F). VEGF-A overexpression
increases both collateral diameter (Fig. 6E) and SMA-positive cell
coverage (Fig. 6F), presumably above some threshold that favors
pruning (Fig. 2C). A scatterplot illustrates the collateral maturation deficiencies in Clic4⫺/⫺ pups (Fig. 6G).
DISCUSSION

Preexisting collaterals are important determinants of tissue
survival after arterial occlusion. However, our understanding
of how they form, mature and persist throughout a lifetime is
limited. The present study demonstrates that CLIC4 is required

for early postnatal maturation of newly formed collaterals.
Within the first postnatal week, mice lacking CLIC4 lose 50%
of the collaterals that form during embryogenesis, and those
that remain grow to a smaller diameter. Both deficiencies
persist unchanged in the adult, resulting in a threefold larger
infarct volume after MCA occlusion. The role of CLIC4 in
collateral maturation involves an interaction with VEGF-A
signaling. During the maturation phase in Clic4⫺/⫺ mice,
expression of VEGF receptors and mural cell marker genes
is reduced. Furthermore, VEGF-A overexpression normalizes most of these expression deficits, prevents both the
defects in collateral maturation and increased stroke severity
in the adult.
We previously reported that fewer pial collateral were present on P1 in Clic4⫺/⫺ mice and suggested that CLIC4 deficiency impairs collaterogenesis (6). However, this conclusion
remained uncertain because in wild-type mice collateral maturation begins after the maximal number of collaterals have
formed by E18.5, followed by slight pruning that is evident by
even P1 (6, 10). More detailed study of CLIC4 in the present
study, including in two different strains of mice, indicates that
CLIC4 deficiency does not affect initial collaterogenesis.
Moreover and unlike in the previous study, embryonic stagematched littermates were examined. This is important because
the maturation state of mice at birth can vary. Typical gestation
is 21 days yet parturition can occur between E19.5 and 22.5,
depending on litter size, cage density, strain, and other factors.

Endogenous CLIC4 expression patterns in the developing
and adult mouse have only recently been described after the
development of a knockin Clic4 green fluorescent protein

mouse model (29). A midgestation, CLIC4 is expressed widely
throughout the embryo and is particularly strong in the brain.
At E13.5, after the pial vascular plexus has formed but before
collaterogenesis begins, CLIC4 expression is strong in the
entire forebrain. By E15.5, expression drops in areas of the

interact, evidence suggests TGF␤ signaling may be involved.
CLIC4 is both regulated by and is an enhancer for TGF␤
signaling (36, 37). After TGF␤ receptor/ALK5 activation,
CLIC4 complexes with transcription factor Schnurri-2 and
translocates to the nucleus, where the complex protects against
deactivation of TGF␤-induced phosphorylated Smad2/3,
thereby enhancing TGF␤ signaling (37). TGF␤ family members are known to regulate VEGF-A expression via Smad
proteins (especially Smad2, 3 and 4, depending on cell type)
and Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling (8, 16, 18, 27). In turn,
VEGF-A regulates CLIC4 expression in both a positive and
negative manner: VEGF-A-activated ECs downregulate Clic4
during tubular morphogenesis in vitro but strongly upregulate
Clic4 in developing embryoid body-derived and pathological
angiogenesis (3). Given the above interactions, in the present
study, deletion of CLIC4 may have reduced, but not fully
blocked, TGF␤ activity and subsequent VEGF-A signaling.
This could account for the reduced Vegfr1 and Vegfr2 expression that we observed in the collateral zone of the pia mater of
Clic4⫺/⫺ mice where pruning was accentuated, and the ability
of VEGF-A overexpression to rescue collateral loss. VEGFR1
largely, but not exclusively, functions as a VEGF-A “sink.”
That Vegfr2 expression was restored in Clic4⫺/⫺;Vegf hi/⫹
mice, but not Vegfr1 expression, suggests upregulation of
VEGFR2 with Vegfa overexpression. This feed-forward effect
of VEGF-A in vivo has been reported previously (12).
Deficiency in outward remodeling of collaterals after
MCAO is unlikely to underlie the greater infarct volume in
Clic4⫺/⫺ mice. It is well established that preexisting collateral
number and diameter in animal studies and collateral score
(“status”) strongly correlate with core infarct volume measured
24 h after proximal occlusion of the MCA (6, 7, 20, 35, 46).
Whether outward remodeling of preexisting collaterals can
occur fast enough to rescue penumbra has not been determined.
In a study of the time course for remodeling of pial collaterals
in the mouse after permanent MCA occlusion, significant
anatomic lumen enlargement of pial collaterals, a process that
requires EC and SMC proliferation and restructuring of ECM,
was first evident at 36 h (46). Much previous evidence in
animals and humans suggests that final core volume is established well before this time (11, 41), although some penumbra
might be evident at later stages in certain individuals.
We found that Clic4⫺/⫺ collaterals are invested with fewer
SMA-positive mural cells at E18.5, and that the pial membrane
containing collateral vessels has lower expression of marker
genes for mural cells. Mural cell coverage remains low through
P4, when collateral diameter is measurably smaller in CLIC4deficient mice. These data are consistent with a report demonstrating that CLIC4 deficiency halts vascular smooth muscle
cell migration by interfering with intracellular RhoA and Rac1
signaling (38). Collaterals form later than the general cerebral
vasculature and because they are not required for survival, they
may be prone to pruning if mural cell coverage is delayed. Our
results also support our previous data showing that CLIC4deficiency results in pruning of collaterals but not neighboring
distal-most arterioles (6). A striking difference between distalmost arterioles and collaterals is that the former experience
unidirectional blood flow while the latter experience little net
blood flow and thus very low shear stress (5). Shear stress
induces TGF␤ signaling in ECs by activating its receptor
ALK5 (44) and downstream Smad2 (13, 14). During develop-

brain but remains strong in the neocortex. It then declines
through E18.5. While the authors did not specifically examine
or discuss CLIC4 expression in pial or other cerebral vessels in
embryos or adults, they state that CLIC4-GFP expression was
uniformly present in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelium in virtually all adult tissues. This observation suggests
that CLIC4 is constitutively present in blood vessels but is
actively reduced in parenchymal cells. Confirmation of this
assumption is currently hindered by absence of specific antibodies (29). Such a decline in CLIC4 expression in parenchymal cells in the vicinity of newly formed collaterals may serve
as a paracrine signal that initiates mural cell recruitment and/or
differentiation. Therefore, when CLIC4 is absent, this disrupts
collateral maturation which is what we observed. This hypothesis is consistent with CLIC4’s interaction with the TGF␤
signaling pathway (see below).
In contrast to collateral maturation, we found that Clic4
deletion had no apparent effect on formation of the embryonic
pial plexus or its remodeling into artery and vein trees. Deletion also had no effect on angiogenesis in the aorta ring assay.
Consistent with these findings, a previous study (43) found that
formation of the outer retinal plexus appeared normal in
Clic4⫺/⫺ mice during (P4) and near the end (P7) of the radial
outgrowth phase, a phase dominated by angiogenic sprouting
and capillary plexus formation (9, 25), although the leading
edge of the plexus tended to reach the outer retinal margin
slightly later. However, on P21 the mature capillary bed had a
lower number of branch points and overall vessel density (43).
Maturation of the early retinal plexus into artery and vein trees
and intervening capillaries involves selective pruning and repatterning processes that occur concurrently with radial outgrowth and are complete by P15 (9, 25). Our observation that
CLIC4 is required for pruning and maturation of the nascent
collateral circulation has analogy to the deficiencies in retinal
vascular remodeling (43).
At variance with these findings are studies using cultured
ECs (3, 42, 43). CLIC4 knockdown inhibits while overexpression promotes proliferation. Level of CLIC4 expression also
affects organization into plexus-like structures and formation
of intracellular vacuoles and lumenization, but not migration of
HUVECs (42). A number of factors could contribute to the
differences seen in vivo, in explant, and in vitro, most prominently that HUVEC cultures lack the presence of other cell
types present in the vascular wall. In contrast, the ring assay
provides ECs, at least initially, in their normal proximity to
adjacent mural cells, which may better approximate the in vivo
setting for ECs and any reliance on CLIC4 for angiogenic
activities. Also, “neovessel” growth begins approximately 2–3
days after the rings have been placed in culture and continues
to 6 –7 days (1). Thus early outgrowth from aorta rings of
Clic4⫺/⫺ mice might not be expected to be altered since CLIC4
does not affect endothelial cell migration, and sprout length
and number are in part based on EC migration. Moreover, since
increasing environmental VEGF-A is well known to intensify
the angiogenic response in cell culture and aortic ring assays
(47, 48), that it did so in the Clic4⫺/⫺;Vegfhi/⫹ rings served as
a control for the assay.
Our observation that VEGF-A overexpression can rescue the
deficits incurred by Clic4 deletion suggests that CLIC4 and
VEGF-A interact to drive maturation of nascent collaterals.
Although little is known about how CLIC4 and VEGF-A

process of collateral maturation, as well as whether altered
physiological conditions or pathological processes can adversely affect it, are important directions for future work.

ment, Smad2/3 activation is not required for embryonic angiogenesis but it is indispensable for the recruitment of mural cells
to nascent vessels and subsequent vascular maturation (17).
Since CLIC4 enhances Smad2/3 signaling (37), CLIC4-deficient collaterals, vessels that are under low shear stress and
thus perhaps low TGF␤ receptor activation, may be unable to
recruit mural cells at the same rate as neighboring distal-most
arterioles and thus more prone to destabilization and pruning.
The mechanism by which CLIC4 mediates smooth muscle cell
investment in collaterals remains to be discovered.
We also observed that Adam10 expression was increased in
P4 CLIC4-KO pial membranes. ADAM10 is a membraneanchored sheddase that cleaves proteins from the cell membrane, and is well known for its role in cleaving Notch to form
the bioactive notch intracellular domain. We previously
showed that endothelial-specific knockout of ADAM10 during
collaterogenesis inhibits collateral formation (21). In perivascular cells, ADAM10 is known to cleave platelet-derived
growth factor receptor ␤ (PDGFR␤), a tyrosine kinase receptor
activated by PDGF (23) that promotes pericyte recruitment to
nascent vessels and differentiation. However, the authors were
unable to show a regulatory role for ADAM10 in PDGFR␤
signaling in vitro. It is possible that Adam10 expression is
increased in vivo during collateral pruning as a compensatory
mechanism to enhance Notch signaling, active endothelial cell
sprouting and PDGF secretion, or is enhancing PDGFR␤
shedding and therefore defective mural cell investment. Studies determining which cell types are responsible for the increased pial Adam10 expression would help interpret this
result.
There are several factors that hinder studying the interaction
between CLIC4, VEGF, and TGF␤ in collaterogenesis. The
major one is that there is no in vitro model of collaterogenesis,
in part because of the inherent complexity of the cell biology
of the process, but also because collaterogenesis, itself, was
only recently described (21). Nascent collaterals form late
during embryogenesis and experience cyclic mechanical forces
from blood pressure and fluid shear stress that, thus far, cannot
be recapitulated in vitro. Therefore, new methods will be
required to permit selective in vivo transfection of expression
vectors into ECs and other cells involved in collaterogenesis at
the proper developmental stage. Another factor is that collaterals must be identified in situ; collaterals by definition crossconnect arterial trees. Therefore, immunohistochemical examination of protein localization and expression must be performed on whole mount tissue, which can hinder antibody
penetration. Last, we used mice with a global deletion of
CLIC4 because no floxed line was available. However, a
mouse line with a floxed CLIC4 allele has been recently
described (30), which will aid future studies.
In conclusion, collateral number and diameter in the adult
depend not only on embryonic collateral formation but also
perinatal collateral maturation. CLIC4 is not required for
collaterogenesis but is necessary to prevent pruning and promote growth of collateral diameter to their normal dimensions
during maturation. CLIC4-deficient mice thus have fewer,
smaller-diameter collaterals in the adult and experience more
severe strokes. CLIC4’s role in collateral maturation involves
interactions with VEGF-A, as overexpression of VEGF-A in
Clic4⫺/⫺ mice prevents the deficiencies in both collateral
extent and stroke severity. A better understanding of the
