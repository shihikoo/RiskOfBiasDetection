Abstract
Background: In response to cerebral ischemia, activated microglia release excessive inflammatory mediators which
contribute to neuronal damage. Therefore, inhibition of microglial over-activation could be a therapeutic strategy to
alleviate various microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. This study was aimed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory
effects of Scutellarin and Edaravone given either singly, or in combination in activated microglia in rats subjected to
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 microglia. Expression of
proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and inducible
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was assessed by immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) levels were determined by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, respectively.
Results: In vivo, both Edaravone and Scutellarin markedly reduced the infarct cerebral tissue area with the latter
drug being more effective with the dosage used; furthermore, when used in combination the reduction was more
substantial. Remarkably, a greater diminution in distribution of activated microglia was observed with the
combined drug treatment which also attenuated the immunoexpression of TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS to a greater
extent as compared to the drugs given separately. In vitro, both drugs suppressed upregulated expression of
inflammatory cytokines, iNOS, NO and ROS in LPS-induced BV-2 cells. Furthermore, Edaravone and Scutellarin
in combination cumulatively diminished the expression levels of the inflammatory mediators being most
pronounced for TNF-α as evidenced by Western blot.
Conclusion: The results suggest that Edaravone and Scutellarin effectively suppressed the inflammatory responses
in activated microglia, with Scutellarin being more efficacious within the dosage range used. Moreover, when both
drugs were used in combination, the infarct tissue area was reduced more extensively; also, microglia-mediated
inflammatory mediators notably TNF-α expression was decreased cumulatively.

Background
Ischemic stroke constitutes most of all strokes and is
caused by obstruction of blood flow to the brain, which
would initiate a complex cascade of metabolic alterations,
including release of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines, activation of complement proteins etc. This
would then exacerbate neuroinflammation and ultimately
cause neuronal death. The innate immune response to
induce postischemic inflammation is undoubtedly the
hallmark feature for the progression of cerebral ischemia
injury [1]. The key cell players in this are the activated
microglia which can act as sensors to detect abnormal
alterations in response to internal and external insults.
Microglial cells are the resident immune cells that mediate neuroinflammation in the central nervous system
(CNS) [2] In neurodegenerative diseases and stroke, they
are activated and engaged in different functions such as
phagocytizing the toxic cellular debris, producing proinflammatory cytokines and enhancing neuronal survival
by release of trophic factors [3]. In chronic activation,
microglia are thought to contribute to neuronal damage
via release of excessive proinflammatory cytokines and/
or cytotoxic factors, such as nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4,5]. As a corollary, inhibition
or suppression of microglia to prevent over-reaction and
inflammatory response of microglia may prove to be an efficacious therapeutic strategy to alleviate the progression
of the neurological diseases.
In the search for potential drugs that may effectively
suppress overt microglial activation, attention has recently
been drawn to Edaravone and Scutellarin. Edaravone (3methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one), a free radical scavenger that is currently used in the treatment of acute ischemic
stroke as a neuroprotective reagent, has been shown to
significantly reduce the infarct size, improve neurological
scores, and decrease ROS generation [6]. More specifically, it can counteract toxicity from activated microglia [7].
Neuroinflammation in middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) may be attenuated by Edaravone which acts
through suppression of expression of proinflammatory
cytokines in activated microglia [8].
Scutellarin (4,5,6-trihydroxyflavone-7-glucuronide) is the
major active component (Figure 1) extracted from Erigeron
breviscapus (Vant.) Hand-Mazz [9]. It is one of the widely
used herbal medicines in China for treatment of ischemic
cerebrovascular diseases. Studies have shown that Scutellarin has neuroprotective effects because of its antioxidant
[10,11] and antiapoptotic [9] properties. Very interestingly,
Scutellarin exerts anti-inflammatory action in several
animal models [12,13]. In addition, it can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of proinflammatory mediators such as NO, TNF-α, IL-1β and ROS
in rat primary microglia or BV-2 mouse microglial cell

line [14]. It decreases the number of activated microglia
and reduces the expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65 and inflammatory
mediators [15].
The above studies have shown that both Edaravone
and Scutellarin have anti-inflammatory effects in activated microglia. It remains to be determined which of
the two common drugs is more potent in its antiinflammatory effect in activated microglia, and whether
there would be a cumulative therapeutic effect when
both drugs were used in combination. This study was
therefore aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory
effect of Edaravone and Scutellarin used either singly or
in combination in experimentally induced cerebral ischemia, and in vitro in the BV-2 microglial cells. We sought to
determine if a combination of Edaravone and Scutellarin at
appropriate dosage may represent a more efficacious therapeutic strategy for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases
in which activated microglia are implicated.

Results
Changes in infarct size in MCAO rats given Edaravone
and/or Scutellarin treatment

A large infarct area was observed in the ipsilateral cerebrum in the MCAO rats at 3 days after MCAO. Compared
with this group, the infarct area of the cerebral cortex was
markedly reduced by Edaravone (E) or Scutellarin (S) treatment or a combination of both drugs (Figure 2A). Treatment of MCAO rats with Edaravone along with high dose
Scutellarin (E + SH) markedly reduced the infarct volume.
There were no apparent differences between Edaravone
combined with low dose Scutellarin (E + SL) group and
Edaravone group (E) or Scutellarin low dose group (SL).
On the other hand, the infarct volume in E + SH group
was significantly decreased compared with Scutellarin high
dose group (SH) (Figure 2B).

each group). (B) Significant differences in infarct volume in MCAO (M) rats compared with other group was expressed as *p <0.05. The infarct volume
in MCAO rat brains treated with E + SH shows marked differences compared with that treated with E or SH, #+p <0.05. Each bar represents mean ± SD.

Microglia were activated after MCAO but were reduced in
cell numbers following treatment with drugs

The infarct size was considerably reduced in MCAO rat
brains at 3 days treated with drugs E, S and E + S in
comparison to untreated MCAO rats. The activated
microglia, in large numbers, were observed in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex of MCAO rat brain without drugs
treatment. The incidence of activated microglia was noticeably reduced in MCAO rat brains when treated with
drug E, S and E + S and this was accompanied by a decrease in the infarct zone being most pronounced in the
last mentioned group (Figure 3).

Edaravone and Scutellarin separately or in combination
reduced the expression of inflammatory mediators in
MCAO rats

To investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of Edaravone
and Scutellarin on activated microglia, we examined the
production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β)
and iNOS in MCAO rats given the treatment of both
drugs either separately or in combination by double
immunofluorescence staining in MCAO rats given either
low or high dose of Scutellarin. Here we show the images
of Scutellarin high dose (SH) only. iNOS immunofluorescence in activated microglia in the penumbral zones was

Figure 3 Reduction in infarct size and distribution of lectin+ activated microglia in the cerebral cortex of MCAO rat brains following
treatment with drugs E, SH and E + SH. Confocal images showing the distribution of lectin+ (green) microglia in the cerebral cortex of MCAO
rat brains with drugs E, SH and E + SH compared to sham-operated control (n = 5 for each group). Dotted lines delineate the size of infarct zone
in the tissue. Note that the infarct size is considerably reduced in MCAO rat brains treated with drugs E, SH and especially with E + SH (C-E) in
comparison to MCAO (B). Additionally, the number of lectin+ activated microglia is noticeably reduced in MCAO rat brains treated with drugs
E, S and E + S as seen in high magnification confocal images (H-J and M-O) in comparison to MCAO (G, L). DAPI – blue. Scale bars in A-E:

noticeably enhanced after MCAO, but it was markedly
reduced at 3 days following treatment with E, SH and E +
SH. This was conspicuous in MCAO + SH and especially
so in MCAO + E + SH rats in which iNOS expression in
activated microglia was virtually abolished (Figure 4). The
expression of TNF-α (Figure 5) and IL-1β (Figure 6) paralleled with that of iNOS after treatment with E, SH or E +
SH. Thus, in MCAO rats given SH or E + SH treatment
notably in the latter and killed at 3 days post-operation,
TNF-α and IL-1β immunoexpression in lectin labeled activated microglia was obliterated. In MCAO rats killed at
7 days, iNOS and TNF-α immunofluorescence that was
augmented following ischemia was attenuated with E,
SH or E + SH treatment (see Additional file 1: Figure S1,
Additional file 2: Figure S2). An additional feature was
the profuse ramification of microglia at this time point.
In general, immunofluorescence of iNOS and TNF-α
was less intense compared with that at 3 days.
Western blot analysis also showed that the protein expression of iNOS, TNF-α and IL-1β was obviously suppressed at 3 days after treatment with drugs (Figure 7).
It is striking that TNF-α expression in MCAO rats
given combined E + SH treatment showed the most
drastic reduction when compared with drugs used separately (p <0.05). The expression level of TNF-α in MCAO
rats treated with E + SH was reduced by about 35%, compared with 24% of treatment with SH alone, i.e. a further
decrease by 11%. Likewise, the expression level of IL- 1β
and iNOS in combined drug treatment (E + SH) was
further suppressed by 7% and 4%, respectively, when
compared with rats treated with SH alone.

Cell viability assay of BV-2 cells

We chose to perform our in vitro studies on BV-2 cell
line instead of primary cultured microglial cells to ensure
that we obtained enough cells for analyzing cell viability
following drug treatment and also obtained adequate
amounts of protein for Western blot analyses. The cytotoxicity data was obtained by the MTS assay for the effect
of Edaravone and Scutellarin on BV-2 cells. A combined
concentration of Edaravone (in the range of 50 μM to
200 μM) and Scutellarin (in the range of 0.27 mM to
1.1 mM) did not result in any significant cell death
(Additional file 3: Figure S3). In this study we have used
Edaravone at 100 μM with Scutellarin at 0.54 mM for
all subsequent analysis.
Edaravone and Scutellarin separate treatment or in
combination reduced the expression of inflammatory
cytokines and iNOS in LPS-induced BV-2 microglia

Consistent with results in vivo, changes in the inflammatory
mediators, including TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS, whose
immunoexpression was also observed in LPS-induced BV-2
cells. TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS immunofluorescence intensity was markedly augmented versus controls when the
cells were subjected to LPS, but was suppressed in LPSactivated microglia pretreated with E, S and E + S (Figures 8,
9, 10). The expression of these inflammatory mediators was
clearly diminished in activated BV-2 cells that were pretreated with S or a combination of the both drugs.
The protein expression of iNOS, TNF-α and IL-1β was
decreased in BV-2 cells pretreated with drugs. In this connection, the expression of TNF-α was further depressed

Figure 4 Treatment of MCAO rats with drugs E, SH and E + SH resulted in the reduction of iNOS expression in activated microglia.
Confocal images showing the expression of iNOS (red) in lectin+ microglia (green) in the penumbral zones of MCAO rat brain (D-F) and following
treatment with E (G-I), SH (J-L) and E + SH (M-O) (n = 5 for each group). Increase in iNOS expression (E) can be observed in the activated
microglia (D) in MCAO rat brain. A marked reduction of iNOS expression (H, K) was observed in activated microglia (G, J) 3 days following
treatment of MCAO rats with drugs E and SH. Further, iNOS expression (N) was hardly detectable in activated microglia (M) when MCAO rats
were treated with a combination of the two drugs. DAPI – blue. Scale bars in A-O: 20 μm.

when E + S were used in combination when compared
with the other groups, a phenomenon that is consistent
with the result in vivo (Figure 11). The expression level of
TNF-α in LPS-induced BV-2 cells with E + S was reduced
by about 49%, compared with 25% reduction in cells given
treatment with S alone. This amounted to a further
decrease by about 24%. The expression level of IL- 1β and
iNOS in combined drug treatment was further suppressed
by 3% and 27%, respectively, when compared with E treatment alone. The expression level of IL- 1β in combined
drug treatment was further suppressed by 5% when compared with S treatment alone, but iNOS expression in
drug combination group was not significantly lower than
that of S used alone.
Edaravone and Scutellarin separate treatment or in
combination reduced the expression of ROS and NO in
LPS-induced BV-2 cells

Intracellular ROS and NO in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia following treatment with E, S and E + S was measured.
ROS production was increased in LPS-induced BV-2
microglia, and significantly decreased in cells pretreated
with E, S and E + S (Figure 12). NO production was markedly increased in LPS-induced BV-2 cells, and was observably reduced when the cells were pretreated with E, S and
in combination. The expression of NO in S or E + S treatment group was clearly reduced especially in the latter
when compared with E treatment group (Figure 13).

Discussion
Neuroinflammation is a key contributor in the ischemic
cascade after cerebral ischemia that leads to neuron
damage and death. Activated microglia in inflammatory
response have both beneficial and detrimental functions
in the nervous system. During neuroinflammation, activated microglia remove cellular debris or invading pathogens, and release neurotrophic factors that regulate the
microenvironment [16]. On the other hand, activated
microglial cells are also elicited to produce a plethora of
proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-1β, ROS
etc., which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of different neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s
disease [17], Huntington’s disease [18], Parkinson’s disease
[19], stroke [20] and hypoxic insults [21]. Therefore, a
prevalent view is that activated microglia can aggravate the
injury and subsequent neurodegeneration and they may

serve as a prime therapeutic target in a wide variety of
CNS diseases.
Here we examined the anti-inflammatory action of
Edaravone and Scutellarin in activated microglia. Both
Edaravone and Scutellarin reduced the infarct size in brain
cortices of MCAO rats, inhibited production of proinflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-1β, NO and ROS) in
MCAO rats and LPS-induced BV-2 microglial cells, as
well as suppressed the experimentally induced increased
expression of iNOS. Activated microglia appeared to emit
many thin cytoplasmic processes when treated with
Edaravone and Scutellarin. A possible explanation for this
would be that both drugs had promoted the ramification
of microglia whose ramified phenotype might represent a
less active state. On the other hand, the possibility that
Edaravone and Scutellarin can suppress the activated
microglia by causing the cells to become more resistant
to transformation into an amoeboid form, presumably a
more active state, is considered. In any event, a significant diminution in distribution of activated microglia
was evident in rats treated with both drugs combined.
Furthermore, we have also provided the first morphological evidence that in comparison to Edaravone, Scutellarin was more efficacious in suppressing the expression
levels of inflammatory mediators in activated microglia
with the dosage used. Additionally, the two drugs in combination cumulatively depressed the expression of TNF-α
both in vivo and in vitro. The results suggest that Scutellarin is more potent in therapeutic potential for various
microglia mediated neuroinflammatory diseases.
Edaravone is a synthetic small-molecule free-radical
scavenger. It has been reported to be effective in inhibiting the inflammatory responses [22], brain edema
[23], ROS generation, and oxidative tissue damage [24].
Edaravone currently is being used clinically to treat stroke
patients. Recently, Edaravone has been shown to possess
neuroprotective and antioxidative effects on the brain
after traumatic brain injury both in rat models and in
patients [25-27]. The likely underlying mechanism for this
is via inhibiting oxidative stress, leading to a decreased
inflammatory response, and thereby reducing neuronal
death and improving neurological function. Many in vivo
experiments have similarly reported that Edaravone could
mitigate microglial activation and suppress the production
of proinflammtory meditors by activated microglia [8,28].
Here, we confirmed the efficacy of Edaravone in inhibiting

Figure 5 Treatment of MCAO rats with drugs E, SH and E + SH resulted in the reduction of TNF-α expression in activated microglia.
Confocal images showing the expression of TNF-α (red) in lectin+ microglia (green) in the penumbral zones of MCAO rat brain (D-F) and
following treatment with E (G-I), SH (J-L) and E + SH (M-O) (n = 5 for each group). A drastic increase in the expression of TNF-α (E) can be
observed in the activated microglia (D) in MCAO rat brain. A marked reduction of TNF-α expression (H, K) was observed in activated microglia
(G, J) 3 days following treatment of MCAO rats with drugs E and SH. Further, TNF-α expression (N) was negligible in activated microglia (M) when
MCAO rats were treated with a combination of the two drugs. DAPI – blue. Scale bars in A-O: 20 μm.

the expression levels of various inflammatory mediators in
activated microglia as shown by Western blot analysis and
immunofluorescence labeling.
It has been reported that Scutellarin could improve
neuronal injury and had protective effect in rat cerebral
ischemia at least related to its antioxidant property [29].
The neuroprotective effect of Scutellarin was associated
with inhibition of the apoptosis-inducing factor pathway
[9]. Recently, some studies have extended that Scutellarin
could inhibit production of proinflammatory mediators
induced by LPS in rat primary microglia or BV-2 microglial cells [14]. The present results are consistent with this.
It is unequivocal from the present results that Scutellarin
with the dosage used based on cell viability assay showed
a greater potency in comparison to Edaravone in its antiinflammation in activated microglia; hence, it is suggested
that Scutellarin is endowed with a better therapeutic potential for various microglia mediated neuroinflammatory diseases.
While both Edaravone and Scutellarin have shown
great efficacy in their anti-inflammatory effect in activated
microglia, the potency of both drugs either administered
separately or in combination has not been explored. We
show here that when compared with Edaravone, Scutellarin was more effective in decreasing the infarct volume in
MCAO rats. Very strikingly, Scutellarin alone suppressed
the expression levels of inflammatory mediators to a
greater extent when compared to Edaravone in activated
microglia. Interestingly, the two drugs in combination
cumulatively depressed the expression of inflammatory
mediators notably TNF-α in activated microglia. Moreover,
Edaravone when combined with a high dose of Scutellarin
decreased the infarct volume extensively in MCAO rats.
On the other hand, expression of other markers was depressed to a lesser extent in activated microglia between
Scutellarin used separately or when combined with
Edaravone. The possible explanation for this would be
that expression of inflammatory mediators and changes
in cerebral infarct volume are not synchronized and
there are other mechanisms involved in response to
brain injury. Notwithstanding, Scutellarin and Edaravone when used in combination can produce a cumulative protective effect in ischemia brain injury.
In the present results, the infarct volume of the cerebral cortex in MCAO rats was obviously decreased when
treated with Edaravone and Scutellarin separately or in

combination. Associated with this was the drastic diminution in numbers of activated microglia. Recent studies
suggest that Toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2,
may have a key role in the progression of brain damage
induced by cerebral ischemia [30-33]. It has been documented that a marked long-term induction of TLR2
expression in microglia activation after transient MCAO,
suggesting an important role of TLR2 activation after
stroke [31,33]. A significant decrease of the infarct
volume in TLR2 deficient mice compared to wild type
mice and altered microglia activation profiles has been
observed [33,34]. The present results showed that the infarct size was considerably reduced in MCAO rat brain
treated with drugs in comparison to untreated MCAO rats.
Meanwhile, the activated microglia were not only reduced
in numbers but many of them had also appeared ramified
phenotype in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex of MCAO rat
brain notably in rats given the combined drugs. The possibility is that both Edaravone and Scutellarin can cumulatively suppress the upregulation of TLR2.
We show here that Edaravone and Scutellarin when
applied in combination cumulatively decreased the expression of inflammatory mediators, being most pronounced
for TNF-α in activated microglia. TNF-α contains soluble
and membrane-bind TNF-α [35]. Activated microglial cells
are the major producers of soluble TNF-α within the first
6 hours after cerebral ischemia [36-38]. TNF-α converting
enzyme (TACE), also known as a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) [39], is involved in multiple cell
signaling pathways, including p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent manner [40]. In light of the
above, it needs to be further explored whether pretreatment with Edaravone and Scutellarin would directly suppress the expression and function of ADAM17, or act on
p38/p44 MAPK to synergisticly decrease TNF-α expression. Scutellarin and Edaravone might target on different
sites of TNF-α expression and this should be considered.
Studies have shown that inhibition of TNF-α using its antibody reduces infarct volume after MCAO [41,42]. This
may offer an explanation on why Edaravone and Scutellarin in combination can markedly reduce the infarct
volume after MCAO. Apart from TNF-α, it is interesting
to note that there was lesser reduction in the expression of
other inflammatory mediators following Edaravone, Scutellarin or combined treatment. One possible explanation for
this may be that the expression of these inflammatory

activated microglia (D) in MCAO rat brain. IL-1β expression (H, K), however, was depressed in activated microglia (G, J) 3 days following
treatment of MCAO rats with drugs E and SH. Also, IL-1β expression (N) was almost totally abolished in activated microglia (M) when MCAO rats
were treated with a combination of the two drugs. DAPI – blue. Scale bars in A-O: 50 μm

Figure 8 TNF-α expression was suppressed following treatment of LPS-activated microglia with drugs E, S and E + S in vitro. Confocal
images show an upregulation of TNFα (E) in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia (D) in comparison to control (A-C). Addition of drugs E and S led to
decrease in the expression of TNF-α (H, K) in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia (G, J). TNF-α was hardly detected in activated microglia when treated
with a combination of drugs E and S (N). Following treatment with drugs E and S, activated microglia emitted thin cytoplasmic processes
(M) reminiscent of the ramified microglia in vivo. DAPI – blue. Scale bars in A-O: 50 μm

mediators has reached the basal levels with either Edaravone or Scutellarin treatment. Therefore, further treatment
with two drugs in combination could not suppress the
expression further except for TNF-α, which may be more
sensitive to the drugs.
A similar phenomenon and possible underlying mechanism are also found on NO expression in BV-2 cells
treated. The NO expression was markedly reduced in BV2 cells treated with Scutellarin or Scutellarin + Edaravone
as compared with Edaravone alone within the dosage
range as determined by cell viability assay. This is consistent with iNOS expression as manifested by inmunofluorescence labeling and Western blot.
The present morphological evidence and protein analysis indicate that Scutellarin is more potent in suppressing neuroinflammation induced by activated microglia
with the dosage used, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains uncertain. Studies have shown that Scutellarin is capable of attenuating the expression of not only
those proinflammatory molecules whose expression
depends on the activation of NF-κB (a major mediator of
microglial inflammatory response), but also those via transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1α (STAT1α) transcription factor [14]. Recent
studies by us have shown that the Notch signaling pathway
is involved in microglial activation and microglia-mediated
cytokine production by promoting the expression of
NF-κB [43,44]. Notch-1 signaling was also identified to
regulate microglial activation via NF-κB pathway after hypoxic exposure [45]. Indeed, there is evidence that Notch/
NF-κB signaling pathways are involved in inhibition of
microglial activation by Scutellarin and production of
inflammatory mediators (unpublished data).

Conclusion
We show here that both Edaravone and Scutellarin could
decrease infarct volume, frequency and distribution of
activated microglia as well as suppress the production of
inflammatory mediators in activated microglia in MCAO
rats. Scutellarin appeared to be more potent in its antiinflammatory effects when compared with Edaravone with
the dosage used. Remarkably, the two drugs in combination cumulatively decreased the infarct size in the cerebrum and diminished the ischemia-induced inflammatory
mediators being most pronounced for TNF-α expression. Thus, Scutellarin or along with Edaravone may
prove to a more efficacious therapeutic strategy for

treatment of microglia mediated neurodegenerative
diseases, such as stroke.

Methods
Ethics statement

This research work has been carried out within an appropriate ethical framework. While handling and use of
rats, ethical guidelines as stated in the National Institutes
of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals were adopted. All experimental protocols and use of
animals were approved by Kunming Medical University
and all efforts were made to minimize the number of rats
used and their suffering.
Animals and experimental groups

A total of 245 adult male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats
weighing 250–280 g were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Kunming Medical University. They
were randomly divided into sham-operated + saline group
(sham), MCAO + saline group (MCAO), MCAO + Edaravone group (5 mg/kg) (E), MCAO + Scutellarin low dose
group (50 mg/kg) (SL), MCAO + Scutellarin high dose
group (100 mg/kg) (SH), MCAO + Edaravone + Scutellarin low dose group (5 mg/kg Edaravone +50 mg/kg
Scutellarin)(E + SL), MCAO + Edaravone + Scutellarin high
dose group (5 mg/kg Edaravone +100 mg/kg Scutellarin)
(E + SH) (Table 1).
Anesthesia of the rats was achieved by an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). The
surgical procedure followed that described previously by
us [46]. Briefly, a circular aperture 3 mm in diameter
was burred in the right parietal bone with a dental drill,
and the main trunk of the middle cerebral artery (MCA)
was exposed and cauterized. In the sham-operated rats,
the same surgical procedure was followed but the MCA
was not cauterized.
Injection of Edaravone and Scutellarin

The rats in the respective groups were given an intraperitoneal injection of Edaravone (5 mg/kg dissolved in
saline; Cat. No. H20070051, Jilin, China) and/or Scutellarin (50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg dissolved in saline; Cat.
No.131021, Shanghai Winherb Medical Technology,
Shanghai, China) at 2 h before and at 12, 24, 36, 48,
60 h after MCAO; rats were sacrificed at 1, 3 and 7 d
after MCAO.

Figure 10 iNOS expression was drastically suppressed following treatment of LPS-activated microglia with drugs E, S and E + S in vitro.
Confocal images show an upregulation of iNOS (E) in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia (D) in comparison to control (A-C). Addition of drug E resulted
in decrease in iNOS expression (H) in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia (G). iNOS expression was obliterated in activated microglia treated with drug
S (K) notably with a combination of drugs E and S (N). DAPI – blue. Scale bars in A-O: 50 μm.

Figure 11 Protein expression of inflammatory cytokines and iNOS was decreased in LPS-activated microglial cells following treatment
with E, S and E + S. The expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS in LPS-activated microglial cells are depressed significantly following treatment
with E, S and E + S. Significant differences in protein levels between LPS and drugs used groups are expressed as *p < 0.05. TNF-α and iNOS
protein expression level in LPS + S group and LPS + E + S group was markedly suppressed when compared with the LPS + E group. Furthermore,
the expression of TNF-α in LPS + E + S BV-2 cells was significantly lower than other groups. Significant differences in protein levels are expressed
as #p < 0.05 and △p <0.01. The values represent the mean ± SD in triplicate.

Figure 12 ROS expression was reduced in LPS-activated microglial cells following treatment with E, S and E + S. Intracellular ROS in
LPS-activated BV-2 microglial cells following treatment with E, S and E + S was measured. The upper panel shows cell counts (y-axis) and log10
expression of fluorescence intensity (x-axis). The lower panel is a bar graph showing a significant change in the fluorescence intensity of
intracellular ROS production following the above treatments when compared with the LPS. Note the ROS production, which is increased after
LPS stimulation, is significantly decreased after pretreatment with E, S and E + S. Significant differences in protein levels are expressed as *p <0.05.

TTC assessment of infarct size

Thirty five rats were used for assessing infarct size (n = 5
for each group). The rats were killed at 3 d after MCAO.
The brains were rapidly removed, frozen at −20°C for
30 min. A total of six 2 mm thick coronal sections of the
brain were then cut in a rat brain matrix starting at the
frontal pole. This series of brain sections totaling 12 mm
in thickness included the entire infarct area caused by the

MCAO. The sections were incubated for 30 min and
stained with 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at
37°C protected from light. After this, sections were fixed
in 2% buffered formaldehyde solution for 4 h. The cerebral infarct area as outlined in white in MCAO rats as
well as in rats after various drug treatments, is depicted
in Figure 2. Infarct areas in each section were measured
using Image J software. A correction for edema was

observed in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia (E) in comparison to control (A-C). Addition of drug E led to decrease in the expression of NO (G) in
LPS-activated BV-2 microglia (H). NO expression was significantly suppressed in activated microglia treated with drug S (J) and a combination of
drugs E and S (M). Scale bars in A-O: 20 μm.

made according to the following formula: infarct area ×
(area contralateral hemisphere/area ipsilateral hemisphere)
[47,48]. Cerebral infarct volume was measured as a percentage of the total contralateral hemisphere, as calculated
with the following formula: total infarct volume = sum of
infarct volume of all sections measured (corrected infarct
area × 2 mm for each section)/total contralateral hemispheric volume × 100.
Cell viability assay of BV-2 cells

Cell viability was assessed by CellTiter 96W AQueous
One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega,
Fitchburg, WI, USA; Cat. No. G3580). To determine
the cytotoxic effect of Edaravone and Scutellarin on
BV-2 cells, cells were plated into 96-well microplates
(104 cells/well) and cultured for 24 h. They were subjected to a combined treatment of Edaravone (in the
range of 50 μM to 200 μM) and Scutellarin (in the
range of 0.27 mM to 1.1 mM) in each well containing
100 μl of culture medium for 1 h in triplicates. Briefly,
20 μl of MTS(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner
salt) reagent was added to each well (final concentration,
0.5 mg ml−1) and the plate was incubated for an additional
4 h. The optical density (OD) was then read at 490 nm
using a microplate reader (GENIOS, Tecan, Switzerland).
The assays were performed in triplicate.
BV-2 cell culture and treatment

BV-2 murine cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS) at 37°C in a humidified incubator
under 5% CO2. The cells were divided into control, LPSinduced, LPS + Edaravone, LPS + Scutellarin, and LPS +
Edaravone + Scutellarin groups. The cells was pretreated

with Edaravone (100 μM), Scutellarin (0.54 mM), and
Edaravone + Scutellarin 1 h at 37°C in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2. The dosage of Edaravone and Scutellarin used was based on cell viability assay when the
drugs were used separately (data not provided). After incubation, the medium was discarded and the cells were
washed with PBS, and then incubated with LPS (1 μg/ml,
Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) for 3 h. The culture medium
was replaced with basic DMEM before treatment. For
controls, the medium was replaced with basic DMEM
incubated in a chamber 95% air 5% CO2. Finally, proteins
were extracted for Western blot analysis.
Double immunofluorescence labeling in the cerebrum
and BV-2 cells

A total of 15 rats of various experimental groups were
used for double immunofluorescence labeling: 1, 3, 7 days
(n = 5 at each time point). Following deep anesthesia with
6% sodium pentobarbital, the rats were sacrificed by
perfusion with 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer. The brain was removed and paraffin embedded.
Coronal sections of 7 μm thickness were cut on a microtome (Model: 2165; Leica, Bensheim, Germany).The
sections were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
For blocking of non-specific binding proteins, tissue
sections were incubated in 5% normal goat serum diluted
in PBS for 1 h at room temperature (22–24°C). After discarding the serum, the sections were incubated in a humidified chamber with primary polyclonal antibody iNOS
(mouse monoclonal IgG 1:100) (BD Pharmingen, San Jose,
CA USA; Cat. No. 610432), TNF-α (rabbit polyclonal IgG
1:100) (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA; Cat.
No. AB1837P), and IL-1β (rabbit polyclonal IgG 1:100)
(Chemicon International; Cat. No. AB1832P) diluted with
PBS overnight at 4°C. Following washing in PBS, sections

were incubated, respectively, with fluorescent secondary
antibodies: Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody and FITCconjugated lectin (Lycopersicon esculentum) that labels
both microglia and blood vessel endothelial cells for 1 h at
room temperature. After 3 rinses with PBS, the sections
were mounted with a fluorescent mounting medium
containing 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma,
USA; Cat. No. F6057). Colocalization was observed by
confocal microscopy (Fluoview 1000, Olympus Company
Pte. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Details of antibodies used are
given in Table 2.
BV-2 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
0.1 M PBS for 20 min. Following rinsing with PBS, the
coverslips with adherent cells were used for immunofluorescence staining. In each group, BV-2 cells were incubated with the primary antibodies as described above
overnight 4°C. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in
FITC/Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room
temperature. After washing, the coverslips were mounted
using a fluorescent mounting medium with DAPI. All
images were captured using a confocal microscope. The
isotopic control confirmed the specificity of all primary
antibodies used (data not shown).
Western blotting analysis for MCAO tissues and BV-2 cells

A total of 105 rats were used for Western blotting analysis. The sham-operated and MCAO rats given saline,
Edaravone and/or Scutellarin injections were sacrificed
at 1 day (n = 5), 3 days (n = 5) and 7 days (n = 5), respectively. The control or ischemic cortex derived from each
group was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.
Tissue samples from various groups were homogenized
with protein extraction reagent (Pierce, IL, USA) containing protease inhibitors. For BV-2 cells of each group,
the cells were lysed with lysis buffer, mechanically scraped
off with a rubber scraper and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm
for 25 min. Protein concentrations of both tissues and
BV-2 cells were determined by using a protein assay kit
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA; Cat. No. 500–0002). Samples of supernatants containing 50 μg protein of tissues or
40 μg protein of BV-2 cells were loaded and heated to 95°C
for 5 min, and were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepoly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% or 12% gels, in
a Mini-Protein II apparatus (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). Protein
bands were electroblotted onto polyvinylindene difluoride
(PVDF) membrane and blocked with non-fat dried milk

for 1 h. The membranes were incubated with iNOS
(mouse monoclonal IgG 1:1000) (BD Pharmingen, San
Jose, CA, USA; Cat. No. 610432), TNF-α (rabbit polyclonal IgG 1:1000) (Chemicon, International, Temecula,
CA, USA; Cat. No. AB1837P), IL-1β (rabbit polyclonal
IgG 1:1000) (Chemicon International; Cat. No. AB1832P),
and β-actin (mouse monoclonal IgG 1:10000) (Sigma; Cat.
No. A5441) primary antibodies diluted in Tris-Buffered
Saline-0.1% Tween (TBST) overnight at 4°C. They were
then incubated with the secondary antibodies, either with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
(dilution 1:3000) (Thermo Scientific; Cat. No. 31460) or
anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1:20000) (Thermo Scientific;
Cat. No.31430). Protein was detected by chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare UK Limited, Bucks, UK) following the manufacturer’s instructions and developed on the
film. The band intensity was quantified in Image J software (National Institutes of Health, NIH, USA). All experiments were repeated at least in triplicate.
Measurement of reactive oxygen species by flow cytometry

Intracelluar ROS production in BV-2 cells of different
groups was evaluated by detecting the fluorescence
intensity of 20, 70-dichlorofluorescene, the oxidized
product of the fluoroprobe 5-(and 6)-chloromethyl-20,
70-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA,
Molecular Probes, Invitrogen; Cat. No. C6827) following
the manufacturer’s instruction. The amount of ROS
production was considered to be directly proportional to
fluorescence intensity given as cell counts and fluorescence intensity at the y-axis in the flow cytometry.
Real time measurement of free nitric oxide

BV-2 cells were treated as described above and the cells
were seeded directly onto glass chamber. NO production
was measured by NO detection Kit for fluorescence
microscopy (Enzo Life Science, NY, USA; Cat. No. ENZ51013-200) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Statistical analyses

The data are presented as mean ± standard deviation
(±SD). Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc test.
The difference was considered statistically significant
when p <0.05. SPSS 16.0 statistical software was used to
analyze data.
