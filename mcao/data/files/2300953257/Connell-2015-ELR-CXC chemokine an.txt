a b s t r a c t
Inﬂammation-related cerebral damage mediated by inﬁltrating neutrophils following reperfusion plays
a role in reperfusion-induced brain damage subsequent to a stroke event. The ELR-CXC family of
chemokines are CXCR1 and CXCR2 agonists that are known to drive neutrophil migration and activation.
The present study demonstrated the beneﬁt of anti-inﬂammatory therapy in the treatment of ischemic
stroke with the administration of the competitive ELR-CXC chemokine antagonist, CXCL8(3–72) K11R/G31P
(G31P). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized, and the middle cerebral artery (MCA) was
occluded for 30 min followed by 5.5 h of reperfusion. Pretreatment with G31P resulted in a signiﬁcant,
dose-dependent (approximately 61–72%) decrease in infarct volumes compared to vehicle-treated animals, but neuroprotection was also observed when G31P (0.5 mg/kg) was administered 1 or 3 h following
the start of reperfusion. The neuroprotection observed following the administration of this competitive CXCR1/CXCR2 antagonist may present therapeutic opportunities for addressing reperfusion-induced
inﬂammatory damage in patients presenting with transient ischemic episodes.

1. Introduction
Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury occurs when cerebral
tissue is transiently deprived of blood ﬂow for a sufﬁcient period of
time. Reperfusion of that tissue can result in the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates, and expression of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules by activated resident brain cells [1]. These pro-inﬂammatory mediators recruit
circulating leukocytes, primarily neutrophils, into the ischemic
extravascular tissue. Activated neutrophils may contribute to I/R
injury by causing microvascular occlusion and the production of
various toxic mediators such as cytokines and reactive oxygen and
nitrogen intermediates [2]. It has been demonstrated that blockade
of neutrophil recruitment or activation is an important therapeutic
approach to cerebral I/R injury [3].

Several neutrophil agonists and receptors have been implicated
in I/R injury including, but not limited to, tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF␣) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1␤) [4], leukotriene B4
receptor (LTB4) [5], reactive oxygen intermediates [6], adhesion
molecules [6,7], chemokine ligand 5a (C5a) [8,9], and a subgroup of
the CXC family of chemokines known as the ELR-CXC chemokines
(CXCL1, CXCL8, MIP-2) [8,10,11]. Chemokines are a family of relatively small (8–10 kDa), but structurally and functionally related
proteins involved in the recruitment of inﬂammatory cells [2]. The
ELR-CXC chemokines represent a class of chemokines that possess
the receptor signaling glutamic acid-lysine-arginine (ELR) motif
adjacent to a CXC motif in the molecule’s amino subterminus [3].
Many authors have demonstrated that the ELR-CXC chemokines
are the primary effectors of neutrophil activation and have additionally shown that their neutralization results in a reduction in
cerebral I/R induced-injury [7,8,12,13]. Thus these mediators have
become an attractive therapeutic target.
The ELR-CXC chemokines bind preferentially to either the
CXCR1 and/or CXCR2 receptors [14,15]. Rat ELR-CXC chemokines
are not strictly comparable to the human chemokines, however

118

homologs of both the CXCR1 and CXCR2 have been discovered in
rats [16,17]. CXCR1 and CXCR2 belong to the class of receptors
called the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), as do the receptors for multiple other neutrophil agonists, for example, C5a, LTB4,
platelet activating factor (PAF), and the bacterial tripeptide formylMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) [18].
Both of these CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors have been shown to
play a role in neuroprotection. Neuroprotection following administration of repertaxin, a potent non-competitive allosteric blocker
of neutrophil CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors [19], has been demonstrated in both permanent and transient models of cerebral
ischemia in rats [20]. As a non-competitive antagonist, repertaxin
administration results in a permanent locking of CXCR1 and CXCR2
receptors into an inactive conformation [19]. Clinically, the use
of a non-competitive antagonist of neutrophil activation may not
be feasible, as the long term inhibition of systemic neutrophil
activation will decrease the body’s ability to counter potential
bacterial infections [1]. The recent development of a novel, competitive antagonist to the ELR-CXC chemokine from a bovine source,
namely CXCL8(3–72) K11R/G31P (G31P) [21], may provide clinical
advantages. G31P has been demonstrated to block both CXCR1and CXCR2-mediated responses as well as antagonizing neutrophil
signaling and chemotactic responses due to the activation of heterologous GPCRs (i.e., those for C5a, LTB4, and fMLP) that are
involved in the neutrophil-induced inﬂammatory response [22]. It
has recently been demonstrated that G31P decreases gut and lung
I/R-induced injury following superior mesenteric artery occlusion
in the rat [23]. To date, G31P has not been tested in a model of
cerebral I/R-induced injury. Using the human analogue of G31P,
we hypothesize that the ability of G31P to antagonize both ELR-CXC
chemokine receptors as well as at least some heterologous GPCRrelated responses could provide a strong therapeutic advantage
against neutrophil-induced inﬂammatory events. In the current
study, we employed a rat model of both permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and reperfusion (tMCAO) developed
in our lab [24]. G31P was then administered at various time points
following the period of ischemia (during the period of reperfusion)
to examine the effect of G31P in a clinically-relevant paradigm.

was re-established (reperfusion) by releasing the sutures for an
additional 5.5 h.

2. Methods

To determine if G31P was neuroprotective in the context of
ischemia-induced cell death only, G31P (0.5 mg/kg) was injected
i.m. 30 min prior to pMCAO, and the experiments were terminated
at the end of 6 h of continuous vascular occlusion (n = 5). Control
animals received the vehicle for G31P (physiological saline, 1 ml/kg;
i.m.; n = 5).

2.1. General surgical procedures
All experiments were carried out at the University of Prince
Edward Island and approved by the Animal Care Committee, which
adheres to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.
The male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–350 g; Charles Rivers; Montreal, PQ) used for these studies were provided tap water and
food ad libitum. Sodium thiobutabarbital (Inactin; Sigma–Aldrich;
St.Louis, MO; 100 mg/kg; ip) was used to anaesthetize the rats and
for supplemental anaesthesia, as needed. A tube was inserted into
the trachea to facilitate breathing. Body temperature was maintained at 37 ± 1 ◦ C using a feedback heating system and monitored
throughout the experiment (Physitemp Instruments; Clifton, NJ).
2.2. Transient and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO and pMCAO)
We have previously published the detailed methodology for
both transient and permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral
artery [24]. Blood ﬂow through the MCA was occluded for 30 min
in the transient model (tMCAO), or the occlusion was continued
for a total of 6 h in the permanent model (pMCAO). Occlusion of
blood ﬂow was conﬁrmed using laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (OxyFlo,
Oxford-Optronix, Oxford) [24]. Blood ﬂow in the tMCAO model

2.3. G31P preparation
G31P was puriﬁed from lysates of G31P expression plasmidtransfected Escherichia coli and characterized as noted previously
[22]. A stock solution (1.0 mg/ml) of G31P was prepared in physiological saline (0.9% sodium chloride) and further dilutions were
also made with saline as needed.
2.4. Drug injection protocol
To determine if G31P was neuroprotective in the tMCAO model,
the indicated dose of drug or an equal volume of vehicle was
injected (intramuscularly; i.m.) either 30 min before occluding the
MCA or 1 or 3 h after reestablishing blood ﬂow (Fig. 1 schematic).
At the end of the 30 min of occlusion, the sutures were removed
and blood ﬂow (reperfusion) was reestablished for 5.5 h, when the
animals were sacriﬁced for stroke size analysis.

2.5. Effect of G31P on tMCAO model
G31P was given i.m. at doses ranging from 0.0005 to 0.5 mg/kg to
groups of rats (n = 5–6) 30 min prior to the onset of MCAO; control
animals were similarly given equal volumes of physiological saline
(1 ml/kg; n = 6). The sutures were left in place for 30 min, followed
by 5.5 h of reperfusion. In follow-up experiments to assess G31P’s
potential for therapeutic use, the highest dose of G31P which had
produced signiﬁcant neuroprotection in the above-noted prophylactic study (0.5 mg/kg) was injected into test animals at 1 or 3 h
(n = 5/group) following the start of reperfusion.
2.6. Effect of G31P on pMCAO

2.7. Effect of cortical injections of G31P
We investigated the effect on infarct volume of direct microinjection of G31P into the cortex in our model of transient occlusion
(I/R). This central injection would allow us to bypass ﬁrst-pass
metabolism to determine if bioactivation and/or metabolism of
G31P is required to produce neuroprotection. The indicated doses of
G31P (0.005–0.5 mg/kg; n = 5–6 rats/group) or physiological saline
(n = 6) was injected into the ipsilateral hemisphere (from Bregma
−0.3 mm, lateral −5.5 mm and depth of −3.0 mm) 10 min prior to
suture placement, followed by 30 min of MCAO and 5.5 h of reperfusion.
2.8. Histological analysis
Animals were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS; 0.1 M; 200 mls) and their brains removed. A rat brain
matrix (Harvard Apparatus; Holliston, MA, USA) was used to slice
the brains into 1 mm coronal sections. For analysis of infarct volume, sections were incubated in a 2% solution of 2,3,5-triphenol

Digital scans were made of every section of each brain and sent
to a reviewer blinded to the drug-treatment group for calculation of infarct volume using a computer-assisted imaging system
(Scion Corporation; Frederick, MD). Infarct areas were quantiﬁed
and averaged, and then multiplied by section thickness (1 mm) to
give a measure of infarct volume for each section. The slices were
also used to conﬁrm the injection sites (tip of cannula) to the prefrontal cortex.

analysis. When only two groups were being compared, the Student’s t-test was used.

or vehicle were made 30 min prior to 6 continuous hours of MCA
occlusion (sutures left in place for 6 h). G31P administration did
not display a discernible neuroprotection in this context (p ≥ 0.05;

in infarct volume compared to vehicle administration (p ≤ 0.05 at
each time point; Fig. 1A and C).

3.2. The effect of delaying G31P treatment until after
re-establishment of vascular ﬂow
An arguably more clinically relevant scenario for ELR-CXC
chemokine immunotherapy would be to begin treatment at the
time of, or after reperfusion of the ischemic site was initiated.
As such, we next assessed the impact of G31P (0.5 mg/kg) treatment that was delayed until either 1 or 3 h after reperfusion of
the ischemic sites. Statistical comparisons were made between
the infarct volumes measured following G31P administration at
each time point and the infarct volume measured following vehicle (saline) administration 30 min prior to MCAO. Administration
of G31P (0.5 mg/kg) at either 1 or 3 h post-MCAO (or following the
start of reperfusion) resulted in approximately 61–72% decreases

3.3. The effect of intracortical injections of G31P on infarct
volume following I/R
Direct intracortical microinjections of G31P were made to
determine whether systemic processing of the injected G31P was
required for full realization of its efﬁcacy in our model of ischemic
stroke. We injected G31P directly into the cortex 10 min prior to
vascular occlusion and found that the treatment reduced infarct
volumes in a dose-dependent fashion, although only the 0.5 mg/kg
dose signiﬁcantly (approximately 53%) decreased infarct volume
compared to the intracortical pre-injection of the vehicle (p ≤ 0.05;
Fig. 3A and B).

4. Discussion
At present, there is only one type of pharmacological treatment
available for stroke patients, thrombolytic therapy (i.e., tissue plasminogen activator; t-PA). Unfortunately, only about 4% of patients
arriving at a hospital following an acute ischemic stroke are eligible
for this treatment [25]. The main reason for this low eligibility is
that the patient must reach a hospital within 4–5 h of the onset
of clinical signs [26]. Therefore, a substantial research effort is
being focused on ways to extend this narrow therapeutic window of opportunity for thrombolytic therapy. The data presented
in the current study suggests that ELR-CXC chemokine antagonism
is a potentially viable therapeutic approach to protect against the
increased cerebral damage associated with reperfusion injury.
Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is associated with an
inﬂammatory response that includes the recruitment of leukocytes,
mainly neutrophils, into the ischemic tissue. Activated neutrophils
release an array of factors, including cytokines, chemokines, and
reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, that can be overtly
detrimental to cellular function and structural integrity [3]. In addition, during reperfusion, the neutrophils being recruited would
arrest on the vascular endothelium, such that high-level cellular recruitment could potentially contribute to decreases in blood
ﬂow within the cerebral microvasculature [3]. Thus, the presence
of activated neutrophils following reperfusion can further exacerbate damage to the brain above and beyond that associated with
the original arterial occlusion. As neutrophils play a pivotal role
in reperfusion injury, blockade of their recruitment could be an
important therapeutic approach to cerebral I/R injury.
Chemokines are a class of cytokines with chemoattractant
properties that stimulate cells to migrate toward the source of
the chemokine [1]. Chemokines and their receptors are constitutively expressed throughout the brain, on microglia, astrocytes
and neurons [27]. In the current study, we demonstrated that
G31P, a competitive CXCR1 and CXCR2 antagonist, provided dosedependent neuroprotection in a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion.
This ﬁnding is consistent with other results showing that G31P can
produce protection against IR-induced local (gut) and distant (lung)
injury following a 1 hour occlusion of the superior mesenteric
artery [23]. In our hands, the optimal dose of G31P was 0.5 mg/kg,
which is consistent with the effective dose used by Zhao et al. [23].
Our study has demonstrated that a competitive CXCR1 and
CXCR2 receptor antagonist can provide neuroprotection in a model
of cerebral I/R. It is possible that in our model G31P, in addition to blocking CXCR1- and CXCR2-mediated responses, may have
provided neuroprotection by blocking signaling and chemotactic
responses to heterologous GPCRs (i.e., those for C5a, LTB4, and
fMLP) that are involved in neutrophilic inﬂammation [22]. This
speculation is supported by evidence in which G31P has been
shown to be protective in a wide variety of disease states that
depend upon an exaggerated inﬂammatory response. Examples
include: the reduction of pulmonary pathology related to airway
challenge with a bacterial endotoxin [22]; inhibition of the development of atherosclerosis in a mouse model of hyperlipidemia by
regulating smooth muscle proliferation and migration [28]; protection against pathology subsequent to aspiration of bacterial-laden
gastric contents (i.e., in aspiration pneumonia [21]); and enhancement of the chemotherapeutic value of cisplatin when used in
combination in mouse H22 hepatoma cell line [29]. We hypothesize that the ability of G31P to antagonize both ELR-CXC chemokine
receptors, as well as these alternate GPCR, could potentially provide a strong therapeutic advantage during neutrophil-mediated
inﬂammatory events. Other laboratories have also demonstrated
the powerful protective effects of antagonizing neutrophil receptor
activation in other I/R models. Using the non-competitive neutrophil CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptor antagonist repertaxin, Bertini

121

et al. demonstrated an inhibition of neutrophil recruitment following ischemia-reperfusion of a variety of tissues including rat brain
[20], liver [30], and intestine [12].
The role of neutrophil inﬁltration in the development of
reperfusion-induced cerebral damage has been studied in transient focal cerebral ischemia by various other strategies designed
to reduce neutrophil accumulation, although the results have been
mixed. Some researchers attempting to prevent neutrophil vascular adhesion have shown neuroprotection [31–36], while others
concluded that neutrophils did not contribute to cerebral infarction
[31,37,38]. Other laboratories have postulated that the stimulation
and increased expression by neural cells of chemokines such as
CXCL8 is needed for reperfusion-induced neutrophil accumulation
and activation [39]. Some neuroprotection studies using antiCXCL8 or cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC; the
rat equivalent of the ELR-CXC chemokine CXCL1) antibodies have
been successful in ischemia-reperfusion models in the rabbit [40]
and rat [41].
In our study G31P produced signiﬁcant neuroprotection when
administered 1 or 3 h following the start of reperfusion. We administered G31P at these time points in an attempt to mimic the clinical
situation where a patient would arrive at a hospital during a stroke
or following the natural re-introduction of cerebral blood ﬂow.
Blocking neutrophil receptors with G31P was able to provide neuroprotection even though the cascade of neuroinﬂammatory events
had already begun. This result is consistent with the study that
administered the non-competitive neutrophil receptor antagonist,
repertaxin, up to 2 h following the start of cerebral reperfusion [20].
Our results further suggest that the neuroprotection observed
with G31P treatment is a result of an action of the parent compound
acting locally within the cortex to inhibit the neutrophil CXCR1 and
CXCR2 receptors. Following G31P direct microinjection locally into
the ischemic area prior to the introduction of I/R, we were able
to demonstrate a similar dose-dependent neuroprotection as that
following systemic, intramuscular administration. This result indicates that I/R-induced ischemic damage can be obtained following
the competitive antagonism of only neutrophils that had accessed
the ischemic tissues.
As mentioned in the introduction, while others have demonstrated neurotrophil activation and migration with permanent
ischemia, in our animal model administration of G31P did not produce neuroprotection when administered prior to a 6-h permanent
occlusive stroke (no reperfusion). This inability to produce neuroprotection was also observed when repertaxin was administered
prior to a permanent occlusion in rats [20]. These results are consistent with the fact that prolonged ischemia, in the absence of
reperfusion, is characterized by glutamate-induced neural toxicity
ultimately leading to necrosis (for review, see Ref. [42]). The inﬂammatory response, which includes the migration of neutrophils from
the vasculature into cerebral tissue, cannot occur if the ﬂow of blood
is blocked or impeded.
In conclusion, the results presented above support the idea that
a full-spectrum ELR-CXC chemokine antagonist has signiﬁcant protective effects against I/R-induced cerebral injury. Thus, providing
an effective pharmacological therapy immediately following an
acute stroke in order to lessen the cerebral damage remains an
elusive goal. The data presented above provides evidence for the
efﬁcacy and the potential for use of G31P as a reversible, broadspectrum antagonist of the ELR-CXC chemokines in experimental
and clinical settings.
