Abstract Thyroid hormones (TH) and receptors (TRs) may
play an important role in the pathophysiology of acute cerebral ischemia. In the present study, we sought to determine
whether serum triodothyronine (T3)/thyroxine (T4) and brain
TRs (TRα1, TRβ1) might change after experimental stroke.
Male adult Wistar rats were subjected to permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion (group P) and compared to shamoperated controls (group S). Animals were followed clinically
for 14 days until brain collection for Western blot (WB) or
neuropathological analysis of TRs in three different brain
areas (infarcted tissue, E1; noninfarcted ipsilateral hemisphere, E2; and contralateral hemisphere, E3). Analysis of
serum TH levels showed a reduction of T4 in group P (p=
0.002) at days 2 to 14, while half of the animals also displayed
“low T3” values (p=0.012) on day 14. This T4 reduction was
inversely correlated to the clinical severity of stroke and the
concomitant body weight loss (p<0.005). WB analysis of
Athanasios Lourbopoulos and Iordanis Mourouzis equally contributed to
this work.

TRα1 and TRβ1 protein expression showed heterogenic responses at day 14: total and nuclear TRα1 were similar
between the two groups, while total TRβ1 decreased 7.5-fold
within E1 (p≤0.001) with a concomitant 1.8-fold increase of
nuclear TRβ1 in E2 area (p=0.03); TRβ1 expression did not
differ in E3. Neuropathological analysis revealed that activated macrophages/microglia exclusively expressed nuclear
TRα1 within the infarct core. Astrocytes mildly expressed
nuclear TRα1 in and around the infarct, along with a prominent TRβ nuclear signal restricted in the astrocytic scar.
Neurons around the infarct expressed mainly TRα1 and, to a
milder degree, TRβ. Surprisingly enough, we detected for the
first time a TRβ expression in the paranodal region of Ranvier
nodes, of unknown significance so far. Our data support that
cerebral ischemia induces a low TH response, associated with
significant and heterogenic changes in brain TR expression.
These findings could imply an important role of TH signaling
in cerebral ischemia.

Introduction
Recent data suggest that thyroid hormones (TH) may play an
important role in the pathophysiology of acute ischemic
stroke. Human studies indicate that altered TH pattern is
evident after cerebral ischemia and a reduction of serum
triodothyronine (T3) appears to be associated with stroke
severity and worse clinical outcome (Alevizaki et al. 2007;
Zhang and Meyer 2010). Similarly, in a broader concept,
changes in TH have been also associated with increased
short-term mortality in the intensive care unit and with adverse

J Mol Neurosci (2014) 54:78–91

long-term outcome in cardiovascular disease (Golombek
2008; Mourouzis et al. 2011).
TH are important during the development of the mammalian brain (acting on multiple processes such as the
migration and differentiation of neural cells, synaptogenesis, and myelination (Bernal 2007) as well as during the
adult life (via a crucial role of thyroid receptors (TRs) on
nervous system metabolism regulation, behavior,
hippocampal/cerebellar function, and angiogenesis
(Williams et al. 2007; Portella et al. 2010). TH mediate
their actions through the activation of nuclear TRs that are
transcription factors with ligand-regulated activity: in the
absence of TH, the unliganded receptors (apo-receptors)
recruit co-repressors and repress the transcription of target
genes; upon hormone binding, the receptors (holoreceptors) exchange co-repressors for coactivators and activate transcription (Chassande 2003). TRs, namely the
TRα and TRβ isoforms, are differentially and abundantly
expressed in the normal and developing brain following a
pattern of regional and cellular heterogeneity; the TRs are
expressed in neurons, oligodendroglia, astrocytes,
ependymal cells, and epithelial cells of the choroid plexus,
with the most common isoform being that of TRα
(Puymirat et al. 1991; Bernal 2007; Wallis et al. 2010).
The “two-edge-sword” (apo- or holo-receptor state) function of TRs is always under the fine control of the available
local thyroxine (T4)/triodothyronine (T3) levels resulting
in fine-tuning of multiple genes (Di Liegro 2008).
Based on these data, the TH/TR system could be
implicated in brain disease processes where damage of
the central nervous system causes active recruitment of
immature “repairing” cells and activation of “fetal” remodeling programs (Cramer and Chopp 2000), such as
the case of stroke. In accordance with this concept,
recent experimental studies have linked TH signaling
with neuroprotection after ischemia via increase of neurotrophic factors and support of survival pathways
(Genovese et al. 2013). Similarly, TH administration
seems to be beneficial in experimental models of preterm intraventricular hemorrhage (Vose et al. 2013),
neuronal trauma (Shulga et al. 2009), and neonatal hypoxia (Hung et al. 2013).
While several studies highlight multiple roles and functions for TRα1 and TRβ1 isoforms after ischemic injury of
the heart (Pantos et al. 2010; Mourouzis et al. 2011), the
role of TRs in the pathophysiology of adult ischemic brain
injury remains largely unknown. Thereby, in the present
study, we investigated whether changes in the TH/TR system can occur using an experimental model of ischemic
stroke in rats. Most importantly, driven by the well-known
role of TH and TRs for brain development, we focused on
the remodeling phase of stroke as a period of high plasticity
and reactivation of developmental gene programming

79

(Cramer and Chopp 2000). Deeper understanding of the
role of TH signaling in the injured central nervous system
may have potential important therapeutic implications.

Materials and Methods
Animal Handling and Experimental Groups
All experimental procedures were conducted according to
institutional guidelines, in compliance with the Greek
Regulations and the European Communities Council
Directive 86/609/EEC. The study was conducted on male
Wistar rats (n=38) of various weights (344–460 g). Rats were
fed a regular diet and given water without antibiotics. Animals
were randomly divided into two groups: group P (n=29)
included animals that were subjected to permanent middle
cerebral artery occlusion; group S (n=9) included shamoperated animals.
Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Model
(p-MCAO)
The p-MCAO model was induced using operational procedures previously described in detail (Lourbopoulos et al.
2008; Lourbopoulos et al. 2012) additionally guided by a
laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) device (ML191 Blood
FlowMeter, AD Instruments) (Harada et al. 2005). Briefly,
rats were orally intubated and anesthesia was induced by
4 % and maintained with 1.5 % halothane in a mixture of
70 % N2O and 30 % O2 using mechanical ventilation (Small
Animal Volume Controlled Ventilator—model 683—
Harvard Apparatus). A LDF disk-probe (slightly modified
MSP300XP miniature surface suturable probe, AD
Instruments) was placed over the right hemisphere using
the natural “pocket” between the lateral skull and the temporal muscle (Harada et al. 2005). The right middle cerebral
artery (MCA) was permanently occluded using a poly-Llysine-silicone-coated 5-0 suture (Lourbopoulos et al.
2008; Lourbopoulos et al. 2012), and LDF monitoring
was maintained for approximately 20 min post-MCA occlusion. After the operation, the LDF probe was carefully
and aseptically removed with restoration of the corresponding temporal muscle architecture.
Special care was paid during the p-MCAO operation for
the least possible traumatic injury to the right thyroid lobe.
Rectal temperature, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP),
arterial blood gases, plasma glucose, and hematocrit
values were also monitored during the operation.
Postoperative intraperitoneal supplemental saline was administered where necessary. Mortality due to stroke was
monitored, verified with autopsy, and measured as a clinical outcome.

Clinical and Motor Testing—Infarction Volume
All surviving animals were clinically examined and weighted
on days 1, 2, 7, and 14 postoperatively. Clinical examination
was performed using a seven-grade modified Bederson’s
Scale (mBS) (Lourbopoulos et al. 2008) and an 18-grade
modified Neurological Stroke Scale (mNSS) (Zhang et al.
2002). Motor testing was performed using the grid walking
test (GWT) (Rogers et al. 1997) and the relative videos were
studied in slow motion to calculate the percentage of fault
steps for each of the four limbs of the animals (Lourbopoulos
et al. 2008). Using the differences of the animals’ body
weights per consequent days, we determined the percent
change of body weight and the data were used as an indirect
expression of a positive metabolic rate (pMR, increase of
body weight) or negative metabolic rate (nMR, decrease of
body weight).
Mean percent hemispheric infarction volume (%HVI) was
calculated as previously described in detail (Lourbopoulos
et al. 2008).

Blood Collection and Tissue Processing
Blood was aseptically collected from the femoral vein of the
animals on days 2, 7, and 14 post-p-MCAO, under halothane
anesthesia, with the aid of a stereoscope. Approximately
1.0 ml of whole blood was collected and serum was separated
with a centrifuge at 3,000 rpm for 15 min. Serum was stored at
−20 °C until further processing.
On day 14, animals were stratified for neuropathology
(n=7) or Western blot (WB) analysis (n=8) of TRs and
sacrificed under deep anesthesia. The former were
transcardially perfused with 4 % paraformaldehyde
(PFH), brains were removed, postfixed overnight in 4 %
PFH, and processed for cryostat sections. The latter were
decapitated, brains were quickly removed, cut into three
different areas (E1: infarction area, E2: noninfarcted right
hemisphere, and E3: left hemisphere; Fig. 2d), snap-frozen
into liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further
processing. The corresponding areas were also collected
from group S.

T3 and T4 Quantification
Plasma L-thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3′ tri-iodothyronine
(T3) quantitative measurements (nmol/l) were performed
with ELISA (Alpha Diagnostic International, TX, USA;
No 1100 for total T4 and No 1700 for total T3) (Pantos
et al. 2005). Absorbance measurements were performed
at 450 nm with Tecan Genios ELISA reader (Tecan,
Austria).

Determination of TRα1 and TRβ1 Protein Expression Using
Western Blotting
Brain tissues from E1, E2, and E3 areas were homogenized in
ice-cold buffer (A) containing 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; pH 7.8), 10 mM KCl,
0.1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.1 mM
ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 0.5 mM
phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Two hundred microliters of
10 % Igepal was added and samples were left in ice for
30 min. Homogenization was repeated and a small fraction
of total lysis was kept for further analysis. The rest of the
homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000g for 5 min at 4 °C, and
the pellet containing the nuclear fraction was washed again in
buffer (A) with 1 % Igepal. The final pellet was resuspended
in buffer (B) containing 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.8), 420 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 1 mM
DTT, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 % glycerol, and samples
were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min (under agitation) followed
by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the nuclear fraction was separated and stored at
−80 °C, while the pellet containing cellular debris and cytoskeleton was discarded. TRα1 and TRβ1 protein expression
was determined in total and in nuclear fraction. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method.
Samples were prepared for sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) by boiling for
5 min in Laemmli sample buffer containing 5 % 2mercaptoethanol. Two hundred micrograms (nuclear fraction)
and 40 μg (total lysis) of total protein were loaded onto 10 %
(w/v) acrylamide gels and subjected to SDS-PAGE in a BioRad Mini Protean gel apparatus. For Western blotting, following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred electrophoretically
to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL) at 100 V and 4 °C
for 1.5 h using Towbin buffer. After Western blotting, filters
were probed with specific antibodies against TRα1 and TRβ1
(Affinity Bioreagents, MA1-216, dilution 1:1,000, o/n at 4 °C).
In order to normalize variations in protein loading, filters of
nuclear fraction were probed with histone H3 antibody (Cell
Signaling, #9715, dilution 1:1,000, o/n at 4 °C), while filters of
total fraction were probed with a-actin antibody (Sigma, dilution 1:1,000, o/n at 4 °C). Filters were incubated with appropriate anti-mouse (Amersham) or anti-rabbit (Cell Signaling)
HRP secondary antibodies, and immunoreactivity was detected
by enhanced chemiluminescence using Lumiglo reagents (New
England Biolabs) and exposed to Hyperfilm paper
(Amersham). Five samples from each group were loaded on
the same gel. TRs were expressed as the ratio of TRα1 and
TRβ1 band density to H3 or actin band density in nuclear or
total fraction, respectively. Immunoblots were quantified using
the AlphaScan Imaging Densitometer (Alpha Innotech
Corporation, 14743, Catalina Street, San Leandro, CA).

Double Immunofluorescence and Neuropathology
Localization of TRα1 and TRβ signal was studied using
double immunofluorescence (dIF) on 10 μm cryostat coronal
brain sections. Following hydration, a short cycle of mild
antigen retrieval (pH 6, 10 min in hot citrate buffer) and
incubation of the sections with 10 % fetal bovine serum
(FBS) for 30 min, primary antibodies were applied overnight.
The following combinations of primary antibodies were studied: TRα1 (1:200, rabbit polyclonal, Acris) or TRβ (1:100,
rabbit polyclonal, Acris) with (a) Mac-3 (1:500, mouse, BD
Biosciences) for macrophages, (b) Iba1 (1:400, goat polyclonal Abcam) for macrophages/microglia, (c) CNPase (1:400,
mouse monoclonal, Millipore) for myelin, (d) NeuN (1:200,
mouse monoclonal, Millipore) for neurons, (e) GFAP (1:100,
mouse monoclonal, DAKO) for astrocytes, (f) neurofilamentH SMI-31 (1:800, mouse monoclonal, Calbiochem) for axons,
and (g) Caspr (1:300, mouse monoclonal, Abcam) for
paranodal characterization. Depending on the primary antibodies used, sections were incubated with the following secondary fluorescent antibodies: goat or donkey anti-rabbit IgG
(Biotium 488) for TRα1 or TRβ and goat anti-mouse or
donkey anti-goat IgG (Biotium 555) for the rest of the
markers. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Biotium)
and mounted with the corresponding Biotium mounting medium. Sections were studied using a Nikon (Eclipse C1 Plus
TE2000-U) or a Leica (SP7) confocal inverted microscope.
Quantification of TRα1 and TRβ expression in the tissue
was performed with the aid of FIJI/ImageJ 1.46j software
(NIH software) on two to four sections, spaced at least
100 μm apart. The stained sections (as described above) were
studied under ×63 optical fields at the following three areas:
the infarct core and scar (e1 area), the close peri-infarct area (+
100 μm distance from the scar border, area e2), and the
healthy contralateral corresponding hemisphere (area e3);
area e3 was used as internal control. Five images were captured per area per animal and the total TRα1 or TRβ expression was measured as “Integrated Density” using the ImageJ
software, as previously described (Theotokis et al. 2012). Data
were expressed as arbitrary density units (IntDen),
representing area and signal intensity. In addition, the same
images were used to evaluate the percentage of cells expressing each one of the two TR isoforms in their nucleus; data per
each cell type are presented as mean percentage values per
high power field. Finally, studies of colocalization and 3D
reconstruction of the TRβ expression in the nodes of Ranvier
were performed using the Imaris Software on confocal z-stack
images.
Antibody Preabsorption Assay
Verification of the antibody specificity was performed with a
preabsorption assay using the corresponding control peptide

81

(Acris), according to the manufacturer’s instructions and protocol. Briefly, the peptide was mixed with the antibody in a
72× molecular ratio and was incubated under gentle agitation
in room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was then used in
place of the primary antibody for the rest of the IF protocol, as
described. Thus, three identical brain sections were used, each
of which was incubated with (a) the primary TRβ antibody
(regular IF), (b) the preabsorbed TRβ antibody with the
corresponding peptide, and (c) incubation only with the secondary Biotium 488 antibody. Sections were mounted with a
DAPI containing mounting medium (Biotium). Pictures were
taken under an epifluorescent microscope.
Statistical Analysis
All data are given as mean ± standard error. Statistical analysis
was performed using the SPSS 18.0 package. Student’s t test
and Mann-Whitney U test or one-way ANOVA (with LSD
post hoc test) were used, where appropriate, for comparisons
of scale data. The possible relations between different parameters were investigated using Pearson correlation coefficients.
Repeated measures general linear modeling was used for the
analysis of serial data obtained from the same animals. Twotailed values of p<0.05 were considered significant for all
tests.

Results
Physiological Variables
All measured physiological variables remained within normal
limits pre- and postoperation (p>0.05, one-way ANOVA).
During anesthesia, rectal temperature was maintained at
37.0±0.1 °C without intraoperative cooling. Intraoperative
LDF monitoring showed successful MCA occlusion in all
group P animals. Mortality due to severe stroke occurred in
14/29 of group P animals, as was verified at autopsy.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage was not observed in any of the
animals.
Initial, preoperative, body weight was similar in both
groups (S, 424.0±12.6 g versus P, 395.5±8.2 g; p>0.05).
Postoperative weight loss (nMR) occurred in both animal
groups in 24 h and day 2 (Fig. 1a), and this was partially
attributed to previously reported postoperative complications
of MCAO surgery (Dittmar et al. 2003; Dittmar et al. 2005).
However, group P exhibited a higher nMR in 24 h (P, −7.2±
0.6 % versus S, −3.3±0.3 %, p=0.0001; Fig. 1a) and continued to lose weight even after day 7 resulting in constant nMR
up to day 14 (P, −7.5±2.6 % versus S, 4.1±1.6 %, repeated
measures analysis, p=0.003; Fig. 1a). These changes of body
weight during days 7 and 14 were strongly correlated with the
stroke severity as was expressed through the mNSS score on

observed T4 reduction in the group of permanent ischemia
was significant (p=0.002) when compared to the shamoperated group. In addition, the decreased T4 levels on day
2 were inversely correlated to the mNSS score at 24 h and day
2 post-ischemia (Pearson’s r=−0.766 and −0.789; p=0.002
and 0.001, respectively), meaning that more severe (clinically)
strokes were associated with a lower T4 serum level. In the
same context, the low T4 levels on day 2 (Pearson’s r=0.767,
p=0.002) were strongly associated with the body weight
reduction (nMR) on day 7, providing evidence for a possible
relation of the low T4 levels on the body weight reduction
seen after stroke.
The serum T3 levels, overall, did not statistically differ
between the two groups during the post-ischemic period examined (repeated measures analysis, p=0.883). However, in
group P at 14 days, approximately 50 % of the values were
lower than the lower T3 limit in group S (“low T3” values).
Furthermore, the 14-day T3 levels in group P were decreased
compared to the corresponding levels at 2 days (for day 2,
1.03 ± 0.08 nM versus day 14, 0.64 ± 0.9 nM; p = 0.012;
Fig. 1d) and strongly correlated with the body weight on day
14 (Pearson’s r=0.653, p=0.011). These changes are in alignment with the corresponding T4 changes.

Neurological Deficits and Cerebral Infarction Volume
The group P animals developed ischemic stroke with
mNSS and mBS scores displayed in Fig. 1b (day 1
mNSS=7.8±0.5 and mBS=4.2±0.4). The % left forelimb fault steps (affected limb) on GWT were on day 1,
64.8±3.0 %; on day 2, 66.8±5.5 %; on day 7, 50.6±
5.2 %; and on day 14, 59.8±7.1 %. Animals of group S
did not exhibit any neurological deficit at any time
point. On day 14, the mean %HVI was 14.76±2.73 %
for group P and hemispheric edema was not detected.
Serum T3 and T4 Levels
Levels of T3 and T4 at 2, 7, and 14 days are shown in Fig. 1c,
d. T4 levels were reduced in group P on day 2 (group P, 22.6±
2.8 nM versus group S, 35.3±2.0 nM; p=0.007), day 7 (group
P 34.7±1.6 nM versus group S, 39.0±1.8 nM; p=0.097), and

p = 0.034); repeated measures analysis revealed that the

TRα1 and TRβ1 Protein Expression in Different Brain Areas
Using Western Blotting
The protein expression of TRα1 on day 14 was similar between the two groups in the three brain areas studied (Fig. 2),
although a trend for reduced nuclear TRα1 was detected in the
infarction area of group P (Fig. 2a, p=0.1).
Conversely, TRβ1 expression on day 14 was different
among the three brain areas studied (Fig. 3). Total expression
of TRβ1 was found to be 7.5-fold less in the infarct area (E1,
p≤0.001, Fig. 3a), while no difference was observed in the
peri-infarct (E2) and remote (E3) regions of group P compared
to group S (p>0.05, Fig. 3b, c). Furthermore, nuclear expression of TRβ1 was found to be 3.5-fold less in the infarct area
(E1, p=0.01) and 1.8-fold higher in the peri-infarct region

Localization of TRα1 and TRβ Protein Expression
in the Brain Using Neuropathology
Confocal microscopy revealed spatial differences in the expression pattern of TRα1 and TRβ on day 14, as expressed by
Integrated Density analysis (Fig. 4a, b). TRα1 expression was
similar among the three brain areas studied, despite a trend for
increased TRα1 expression in the infarction core compared to
the peri-infarct area (p=0.08, Fig. 4a). Conversely, TRβ expression was greatly reduced in the infarct core compared to
the peri-infarct area (Fig. 4b).

Further detailed analysis showed that TRα1 was heterogeneously expressed in different cell types. Neurons in
cortical and subcortical structures (neocortical layers II/III
and VI, piriform cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, and striatum) were TRα1+, in agreement with previous reports (Wallis et al. 2010), except the infarction core
where few—if any—neurons were present (Fig. 5a–c). In
the peri-infarct area (e2), 71.8±3.6 % of NeuN + cells
expressed a nuclear TRα1, whereas in area e3, the nuclear
TRα1 signal was detected 39.6±7.3 % of the NeuN + cells
(p = 0.0003, Fig. 4c). The majority of the astrocytes
expressed a weak nuclear TRα1 (91.1±2.2 %) in the
infarct scar (e1) and the proximal peri-infarct area (86.1±
2.9 %, p=0.361). The majority of “resting” astrocytes in e3
were TRα1 negative (4.1±1.3 %, Figs. 4d and 5d–f).
Oligodendrocytes constantly expressed TRα1 (both nuclear
and cytoplasmic expression) within the gray and white
matter, with no significant differences among the three
brain areas studied (e1–3, Fig. 4e); within the infarction
core and peri-infarct scar, scarce oligodendrocytes were
only present without any difference in TRα1 expression
(Figs. 4e and 5g–i2). Axons (SMI31 positive) were TRα1negative (Fig. 5j–l). Within the infarction core,
macrophages/amoeboid microglia or foam cells (Iba1+
cells) ubiquitously expressed TRα1 in their nucleus

(Figs. 4f and 5m). Outside of the infarction, all resting or
ramified microglia (Iba1+) in the rest of the brain (areas e2
and e3) were TRα1 negative (Figs. 4f and 5n, o).
TRβ was also expressed on neurons in areas e2 and e3,
although its signal was weaker than TRα1, whereas the infarction core (area e1) was devoid of any neurons (Figs. 4c
and 6a–c). In these areas, 56.7±6.9 % (e2) and 7.7±3.1 %
(e3) of NeuN + cells exhibited a nuclear TRβ signal
(p< 0.0001). Astrocytes were TRβ negative in the periinfarction area (e2, Fig. 6e) and the noninfarcted hemisphere
(area e3, Fig. 6f), but the majority of them expressed a strong
TRβ nuclear signal in the astrocytic scar (89.8±2.6 %,
Figs. 4d and 6d). Oligodendrocytes were ubiquitously TRβ+
in areas e2–e3 (Fig. 6h–j(2)) and area e1 (although few
CNPase+ cells could be detected in the infarction). Axons
were negative for TRβ in all areas studied (Fig. 6k–m(2)).
Interestingly and in contrast to TRα1, all Iba1+ cells were
TRβ negative within the infarction core (Figs. 4f and 6n); we
could only detect a few foci of cytoplasmic TRβ signal within
phagocytes (insert in Fig. 6n), which could be phagosomes of
unknown composition. Resting or ramified microglia in the e2
and e3 areas similarly did not express TRβ (Fig. 6o, p).
Overall, the expression and localization of TRα1 and TRβ
in relation to the different cell types studied is summarized in
Fig. 7.

extended for 1–2 μm within the juxta-paranodal area of the
myelin sheath (Fig. 8c, d). This localized expression of TRβ
in the paranodal region followed the general expression pattern of TRβ (reduced in the infarction core, no differences in
areas e2 and e3, data not shown). Preabsorption of the TRβ
antibody with its antigenic peptide abolished its signal in both
paranodal areas and brain cells, as shown in the Supplementary
figure, further supporting the specificity of our data.

Interestingly enough, a consistent TRβ expression was observed in the myelinated white matter tracts of the brain as a
repeated pattern of “paired-dotted” signal (Figs. 6i(2), j(2),
and 8), interrupted by a space of approximately 1 μm between
dots, which is in accordance with the Ranvier node width
(Zoupi et al. 2011). This signal was ubiquitously coexpressed with myelin in the corpus callosum and cortex
(CNPase+, Fig. 6i(1), j(2)) and was adjacent to axons
(SMI31+ axons, Fig. 6l(1), m(2)). Double IF for Caspr
(paranodes) indicated that TRβ was co-expressed in the
paranodal region of Ranvier nodes (Fig. 8a, b). In addition,
3D reconstruction studies revealed that TRβ expression

differentially implicated in the local tissue processes in and
around the ischemic infarct. TRα1 is preferentially expressed
by macrophages and TRβ by reactive astrocytes within the
infarction, 14 days after ischemia. At the same time, neurons
around the infarct exhibit increased nuclear localization of
TRs (mainly TRα1). Finally, we surprisingly detected for
the first time a novel localization of TRβ in the paranodal/
juxta-paranodal area of Ranvier nodes in the rat brain, with
unknown function and relevance so far.
A post-ischemic decline in serum T4 levels is already
evident acutely post-ischemia. This decline remains up to

14 days and is also associated with late “low T3” values in
half of the animals. The present findings are in accordance
with previous clinical studies that reported low TH levels in
stroke patients (Alevizaki et al. 2007; Zhang and Meyer
2010). Low levels of TH seem to be protective after stroke,
as indicated by recent clinical observations (Akhoundi et al.
2011; Wollenweber et al. 2013). However, the significance of
TH reduction after stroke is yet not fully known. It could
represent a “reflex” response of the tissue/organism to protect
itself from the low-oxygen (low-energy) state (Diano and
Horvath 2008; Simonides et al. 2008) or even a response to

the “aseptic” inflammation after ischemia as part of the
“nonthyroidal illness syndrome” (Boelen et al. 2011).
However, a sustained hypothyroid state observed after stroke
seems to delay rather than actually prevent neuronal death
(Lee et al. 2010); in accordance to this, acute T4 administration after stroke seems to be beneficial, at least during the first

24 h (Genovese et al. 2013). On the other hand, the association
of TH with the catabolic state of the animals (sarcopenia)
observed after MCAO may seem partially contradictory.
Hypothyroidism is usually associated with a gain of weight
as well as low-energy consumption (Mistry et al. 2009), yet
sarcopenia after MCAO could probably be explained at least

Fig. 7 Schematic summary of
the TRα1 and TRβ expression
and localization 14 days after a
focal ischemic stroke. Areas e1,
e2, and e3 correspond to the
infarct core and scar, proximal
peri-infarct tissue, and contralateral hemisphere, respectively.
Macrophages and foam cells are
located within e1 and express only nuclear TRα1. Astrocytes
mildly (+) express nuclear TRα1
in e1 and e2 areas and a strong
(+++) nuclear TRβ within the astrocytic scar. Neurons are mainly
TRα1+ (and weakly TRβ+) in all
three areas, but close to the infarct
(e2 peri-infarct area), more of
them exhibit a stronger TRα1 and
TRβ signal (mainly nuclear). Oligodendrocytes universally express both TRs in all three areas
studied (not illustrated here).
These distributions pose different
possible effects of the TH over the
different cellular populations of
the infarcted brain

as a combination hypothyroidism, post-stroke inflammation
(Iadecola and Anrather 2011), and a probable implication of
the orexin pathways (inducing low food intake and reduced
mobility) (Lopez et al. 2010; Xiong et al. 2013). In any case,
the TH reduction seems to have important implications in the

pathophysiology of ischemia and warrants further
investigation.
Although TRs are the mediators of TH action, their expression and localization in the infarcted brain remains largely
unknown. Despite their importance for the developing

J Mol Neurosci (2014) 54:78–91

nervous system (Di Liegro 2008), data during the remodeling
processes of stroke are lacking. During remodeling (which
lasts for several weeks post-ischemia), the peri-infarct zone
mimics early developmental stages (a “switch” to developmental conditions) with increased plasticity and permissive
microenvironment (Cramer and Chopp 2000; Carmichael
2006; Cramer 2008). It is therefore tempting to speculate that
the combination of low TH values along with the specific
nuclear expression of TRs resembles embryonic stages, a time
where TH/TR balance favors the “apo-receptor” state and
during which brain cell numbers increase (Bernal and Morte
2013). Similarly, studies in neonatal cardiomyocytes as well
as during post-ischemic cardiac remodeling (Pantos et al.
2012) dictate a possible conserved role for TH signaling in
control of the balance between proliferation and differentiation in various organs.
Our WB data show that total TRα1 protein expression is
similar to sham-operated animals in all brain areas examined,
while TRβ1 is heterogeneously modified in the infarct core
(reduced expression) and peri-infarct tissue (possible nuclear
translocation). More importantly, neuropathology indicates
that TRs’ expression derives from different localization as
well as different cellular populations. Within the infarction
core, neurons are absent and TRα1 expression originates from
reactive macrophages/microglia and astrocytes. Around the
infarction, neurons are expressing more TRα1 (and to lesser
extent TRβ) in their nucleus compared to the healthy hemisphere. This indicates that the TH signaling is more active,
suggesting a mechanism of adaptive response under stress as
observed in other injury models (Mourouzis et al. 2011;
Shulga and Rivera 2013) and TRα1 transgenic animals
(Wallis et al. 2008). The lower TR expression in neurons
distant from the infarct (contralateral hemisphere), along with
diminished nuclear localization, could probably indicate a
lower activation of TH signaling in unstressed state. This
diversity warrants further studies to identify the exact mechanisms underlying the potential implication of TH in the
remodeling/repair processes after cerebral ischemia.
The majority of resting microglia in remote from infarction
areas do not express TRα1 or TRβ, while infarction
macrophages/microglia are all TRα1+. The latter suggests
that the cellular activation state might influence the expression
pattern of TRs or vice versa. On one hand, this concept is
consistent with evidence suggesting that nuclear receptors and
co-repressors (NCoR) can determine the state of microglia and
macrophage activation (Ogawa et al. 2004; Saijo et al. 2013).
In the case of NCoR particularly, their direct implication with
TR function (Astapova and Hollenberg 2013) provides evidence for multiple genomic functions of TH on macrophages/
microglia. On the other hand, TH (in particular T4) seems to
antagonize directly members of the proinflammatory macrophage cytokines (MIF) via nongenomic mechanisms, thereby
providing a second level of TH control over macrophage

89

activity (Al-Abed et al. 2011). Furthermore, previous studies
have highlighted the role of TH on microglial behavior in the
developing brain (Lima et al. 2001) and such an effect could
also be present in the post-ischemic “developmental switch.”
Overall, the observed TRα1 upregulation in macrophages/
microglia after cerebral ischemia needs to be further
elucidated.
To our knowledge, we show for the first time that TRs
(mainly TRβ and to a lesser degree TRα1) are selectively
upregulated in the reactive astrocytes of the glial ischemic
scar. Although previous reports have identified that astrocytes
express TRα and TRβ subtypes and, therefore, are direct
target cells for TH (Manzano et al. 2007), their role in postlesional astrocytosis has not been—to our knowledge—investigated. Developmental studies indicate that TH promote astrocytic differentiation (Trentin and Moura Neto 1995; Trentin
2006), and recent pharmacological data suggest that T4 administration after blunt brain injury (Tatsumi et al. 2005) or
focal ischemia (Genovese et al. 2013) reduces astrocytic proliferation or GFAP expression. In addition, the role of astrocytes in the post-ischemic scar may also extend to a regulation
of local T4/T3 levels (via deiodinases) (Courtin et al. 2005);
conversely, T4 can control astrocytic glutamate uptake
(Mendes-de-Aguiar et al. 2008) or the release of neurotrophic
factors (Shulga et al. 2009), both of which can potentially
support post-ischemic neurons. Overall, our data suggest that
astrocytic post-ischemic functions are probably performed in
an environment of high TR expression and low serum TH
concentrations (leading to “apo-receptor” state of TRs), although direct proof of brain post-ischemic TH levels is still
lacking. In this context, the pharmacological manipulation of
TRβ (mainly) and TRα post-ischemia could have important
implications for the control of astrocytic functions.
Finally, along with the spatial expression of TRs, we detected for the first time that TRβ is abundantly expressed in
the paranodal and juxta-paranodal regions of myelinated
axons in the nonischemic tissue. TRβ localization in the
paranodal and juxta-paranodal areas of Ranvier nodes could
be paired to the reported presence of potassium channels (KvKCNQ2 and KCNQ3) that are important for the regulation of
repetitive discharges (Devaux et al. 2004; Zoupi et al. 2011).
Since TRβ1 but not TRα1 can deactivate other voltageactivated potassium channels (KCNH2 channels) (Storey
et al. 2006), our results may suggest a control of the regional
potassium channels by TRβ1, which remains to be verified. In
addition, the presence of TRβ in the complex of Ranvier
nodes could theoretically influence myelin formation, compaction, and function in this specific area. Given the fact that
TH in general are considered important to myelination during
development (Bernal 2007) or demyelinated CNS disorders
(Calza et al. 2010), the TRβ presence in the Ranvier nodes
points at possible, undiscovered so far, nongenomic TH actions that may guide or tune the myelination processes.

90

In conclusion, our study provides experimental evidence
for (1) time-specific reductions in TH levels up to day 14 poststroke; (2) cell-specific, spatial changes in TRs post-ischemia;
and (3) TRβ localization in the paranodal and juxta-paranodal
areas of Ranvier nodes in the post-ischemic CNS. Further
studies should elucidate the precise time kinetics of TRs and
thyroid metabolism after stroke and determine the relevant
effects and mechanisms on post-stroke remodeling pathology.
