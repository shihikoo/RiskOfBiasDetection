Few effective treatment options exist for stroke beyond the hyperacute period. Radical generation and myeloperoxidase (MPO)
have been implicated in stroke. We investigated whether pharmacologic reduction or gene deletion of this highly oxidative enzyme
reduces infarct propagation and improves outcome in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mouse model (MCAO). Mice
were treated with 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH), a speciﬁc irreversible MPO inhibitor. Three treatment regimens were
used: (1) daily throughout the 21-day observational period, (2) during the acute stage (ﬁrst 24 hours), or (3) during the subacute
stage (daily starting on day 2). We found elevated MPO activity in ipsilateral brain 3 to 21 days after ischemia. 4-Aminobenzoic acid
hydrazide reduced enzyme activity by 30% to 40% and ﬁnal lesion volume by 60% (P o0.01). The MPO-knockout (KO) mice
subjected to MCAO also showed a similar reduction in the ﬁnal lesion volume (P o 0.01). The ABAH treatment or MPO-KO mice also
improved neurobehavioral outcome (P o0.001) and survival (P = 0.01), but ABAH had no additional beneﬁcial effects in MPO-KO
mice, conﬁrming speciﬁcity of ABAH. Interestingly, inhibiting MPO activity during the subacute stage recapitulated most of the
therapeutic beneﬁt of continuous MPO inhibition, suggesting that MPO-targeted therapies could be useful when given after
24 hours of stroke onset.

INTRODUCTION
Stroke is the fourth most common cause of mortality and a
leading cause of long-term disability in the United States.1
Inﬂammation has been shown to correlate with adverse stroke
outcomes in animal models and human studies,2,3 and has been
implicated both in propagation of tissue damage and in
postischemic tissue repair.4
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is highly expressed and secreted by
neutrophils, monocytes, activated macrophages, and brain microglia in response to injury and inﬂammation. Elevated MPO activity
concomitant with leukocyte inﬂux into the ischemic brain has
been found in animal models of stroke.5,6 As such, MPO has been
used as an inﬂammatory marker for stroke.7,8 Interestingly,
leukocyte depletion in stroke markedly decreased MPO activity
and resulted in smaller infarct size,5 suggesting that MPO may not
just be a bystander. Myeloperoxidase interacts with hydrogen
peroxide to generate highly reactive species including hypochlorite and radicalized oxygen species, and its activity can promote
apoptosis and nitrotyrosination of proteins.9,10 Thus, increased
MPO activity may contribute to infarct progression through
protein alterations and oxygen radical generation that leads to
cell death. In humans, serum levels of MPO are elevated after
stroke11 and these levels reportedly correlate with infarct volume8,

particularly for certain MPO genotypes.12 Additionally, MPO has
also been implicated in other cardiovascular diseases in humans,
including myocardial infarction,13 congestive heart failure,14 and
peripheral vascular disease.15
Despite evidence supporting a deleterious effect of inﬂammation and associated elevation of MPO levels in stroke,2,7,8,12,16,17 it
is not yet clear whether MPO participates in infarct propagation or
serves only as a marker for inﬂammation. Indeed, one investigation reported that infarct volume is actually larger in MPOknockout (KO) mice after transient cerebral ischemia based on the
area of infarction and edema within 24 hours after infarct induction.18 Because MPO activity peaks later, around 3 to 7 days after
stroke,19 we tested whether reduced MPO activity corresponds
to a reduction in infarct size when examined over longer time
periods, and whether MPO inhibition or deﬁciency would be
beneﬁcial for ischemic stroke, particularly beyond the acute stage
after 24 hours when MPO and inﬂammation peak.19

conducted according to National Institute of Health guidelines. In all, 8- to
11-week-old male animals were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and housed in a facility approved by the Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International.
Experiments were performed in a total of 103 male mice (Figure 1). Among
these, right-sided cerebral ischemia was induced in 72 C57B/L6 wild-type
mice and 17 MPO-KO mice (13th generation backcross on the C57B/L6
background, The Jackson Laboratory) by occluding the right middle
cerebral artery temporarily for 30 minutes using a thread occlusion model,
followed by reperfusion, as previously described.19 An additional 14 C57B/
L6 wild-type mice underwent the surgical procedure without actual
occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (sham mice). None of the mice
developed gross intracranial hemorrhage either on imaging or at killing.
Please refer to Figure 1 for distribution and numbers of animal in different
treatment and control groups.

Treatment Protocol and Myeloperoxidase Inhibition
Wild-type C57B/L6 mice were randomly selected for treatment with either
400 μL of saline vehicle (controls) or 400 μL of the speciﬁc irreversible MPO
inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH)20 at a dose of 40 mg/kg,
twice daily, injected intraperitoneally. Three MPO-KO mice were also
treated with ABAH as an additional control (Figure 1). This dose of ABAH
has been shown to result in substantial inhibition of MPO activity in vivo in

a murine model of demyelinating disease.21 4-Aminobenzoic acid hydrazide appears to be able to cross the intact blood–brain barrier (BBB)
(Supplementary Figure S1), and passage into the central nervous system
would be expected to be further facilitated during the subacute stage of
infarction at which time there can be signiﬁcant BBB breakdown. Three
treatment regimens were used: (1) daily injections throughout the entire
observational period (21 days) beginning within half an hour after completion of stroke induction, (2) two injections during the ﬁrst day (day 0),
administered 30 minutes after stroke induction followed by another
injection 8 hours later (acute stage), and (3) daily injections starting on
day 2 and continuing to day 21 after infarct induction (subacute stage). To
ensure that the injection procedure and schedule is identical and
controlled for in all groups, in groups 2 and 3, saline vehicle was injected
during days when ABAH was not administered. In addition to these groups,
in a fourth group, ABAH was administered to mice from day 0 to day 3
after infarct induction at which time they were killed and the brain used for
biochemical peroxidase assays. Administration of ABAH does not signiﬁcantly alter physiologic parameters (temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate) of the mouse (Supplementary Figure S2). The mice were assessed
daily and tolerated the injections well. In neither group was there any
evidence of associated inﬂammation or infection at the injection sites. To
control for any potential unexpected effects of the injection procedure, all
animals received a similar injection regimen, either ABAH or the saline
vehicle as a control, including sham animals.

Conventional Brain Magnetic Resonance Imagings and
Determination of Lesion Volumes
A subset of animals underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) of
the brain (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging was performed up to
21 days after stroke induction, including days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21, on a 4.7-T
animal MRI scanner (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) with a dedicated mouse
head coil. Coronal diffusion-weighted images (DWI) were obtained on days
1 and 3 and coronal T1w and T2w images were obtained at all time points.
The scans in a subset of animals also included MPO-Gd molecular imaging
as described in the next section. Mice were anesthesized using isoﬂurane
gas (0.5% to 2.5%) which was adjusted throughout the imaging process to
keep a consistent respiratory rate while being monitored by the Model
1025 MRI compatible small animal monitoring and gating system (SA
Instruments, Stony Brook, NY, USA). Rectal temperature was also monitored and maintained at 37°C by adjusting an MR-compatible small animal
heating system (SA Instruments) throughout the imaging procedure. After
scanning, the mice were placed under oxygen and heated using the
Air-Therm ATX (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) until they
were conscious. Image analysis and segmentation was performed using
the OsiriX DICOM viewer (http://www.osirix-viewer.com/). Total lesion
volume was calculated by multiplying the sum total cross-sectional area of
the lesion by slice thickness over the entire brain.
The evolution of cerebral infarction was assessed ﬁrst on DWI/apparent
diffusion coefﬁcient (ADC) images on day 122,23. Diffusion-weighted image
is highly accurate in identifying the area of irreversible ischemia, shows
good correlation with damage on histopathologic specimens, and is widely
used in clinical practice to determine infarcted tissue area.24,25 To
determine the day 1 infarct volume, the area of restricted diffusion
represented by the hypointense area on the ADC map on day 1 after stroke
induction was segmented using the OsiriX DICOM viewer and used to
calculate the volume, as described above. Thereafter, at all other time
points starting on day 3 after stroke induction, the infarcted area was
determined based on abnormally hyperintense areas on T2w images
representing infarcted tissue and vasogenic edema. Final lesion volume

was determined by segmentation of the residual abnormal hyperintense
tissue on T2w images on day 21, after resolution of edema, representing
gliosis and infarcted tissue. To correct for potential variations in the initial
ictus, the normalized ﬁnal volume was also calculated by dividing the day
21 volume in each mouse by the volume on the ADC map on day 1 in that
mouse, expressed as a percentage. The images were evaluated by three
authors independently and blinded to the groups.

Molecular Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Neuroinﬂammation
with MPO-Gd
This is described in greater detail in Supplementary methods and in
published studies.19,21,26,27 Brieﬂy, in a subset of animals imaged (ﬁve
saline-treated control mice and seven ABAH-treated mice), MR molecular
imaging was performed using the activatable MR contrast agent bis-5HTDTPA-Gd (MPO-Gd) up to day 21, a sensitive and speciﬁc contrast agent for
evaluation of MPO activity in vivo. After the intravenous administration of
0.3 mmol/kg of MPO-Gd, coronal T1w images were obtained at 6, 15, 30,
45, 60, and 75 minutes sequentially. Because early enhancement (6
minutes after contrast agent injection) represents mostly leakage through
BBB breakdown, whereas delayed enhancement is derived mostly from
agent retention caused by MPO activation,19,21,27 in vivo MPO activity was
determined semiquantitatively by calculating the ‘activation ratio’,19 by
dividing the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of lesions on delayed
(60 minutes) images by the early (6 minutes) postcontrast images. The
CNR at each time point was calculated using the formula SI(lesion) − SI
(normal brain)/stdev noise, where SI(lesion) is the signal intensity of the
lesion, SI(normal brain) is the signal intensity with the region of interest
placed in the contralateral normal appearing brain parenchyma, and stdev
noise is the standard deviation of noise obtained by placing the region of
interest outside the mouse cranium in an empty area within the ﬁeld
of view.

Pooled data from seven control (saline) treated mice show the mean infarct volume on day 1 based on the volume of area of restricted
diffusion on the ADC map and the abnormal T2 hyperintense areas (days 1 to 21) representing a combination of infarcted tissue and edema.

Peroxidase Activity Assays
Peroxidase activity assays were performed on the extracellular and
intracellular brain fractions prepared from fresh perfused brain samples
as described in published studies21,28 and as described in greater detail in
Supplementary methods. A total of six mice (three controls and three
ABAH) were evaluated on day 3 after stroke induction. The activity for each
sample reaction was calculated and normalized by dividing by the day 1
infarct volume based on the areas of restricted diffusion on MRIs
performed for each mouse on day 1 after stroke.

Neurobehavioral Testing
Neurobehavioral tests were performed by an investigator who was
blinded to the experimental groups on three cohorts of wild-type mice,
consisting of sham (n = 8; receiving saline vehicle), saline vehicle-treated
stroke (n = 11), and ABAH-treated stroke (n = 10) mice on days 3, 7, and
21 after infarction (Figure 1), as described in published studies.29
Similar testing was also performed in six additional sham mice treated
with ABAH as an additional control. Furthermore, testing was performed in
four MPO-KO mice (receiving saline vehicle) and three MPO-KO mice
receiving ABAH.
Neurobehavioral tests were also performed and compared in mice
treated only during the acute stage (n = 5) or subacute stage (n = 8). The
sham mice underwent the surgical procedure without actual occlusion of
the middle cerebral artery. Neurologic severity scores were determined by
a number of tests to assess posture, position, and movement. Animals
were suspended vertically by the tail and ﬂexion of forelimb, head
movement 410° to vertical axis, and circling toward paralytic side were
assessed. Three tests were performed in an open ﬁeld to assess abnormal
gait, circling toward the paralytic side, and frequency of falling over; pinna
reﬂex (a head shake upon touching the auditory meatus) and visual

placement test (stretching of forelimbs to meet an approaching object)
were also evaluated. Each test was scored as 1 for normal and 0 for
abnormal, yielding a summed injury score from 0 to 8 with a maximal
deﬁcit score of 0.29 Mice were pretrained 1 day before surgery and mice
with seizures were excluded from the analysis.

Statistical Analysis
Results were reported as mean ± standard error of measurement. For
groups with a Gaussian distribution (n ≥ 6), means were compared using
the t-test (one-tailed for comparison of MPO activity after addition of the
inhibitor ABAH; two-tailed for all other outcome measures, including ﬁnal
infarct volume). For groups with non-Gaussian distributions (no6),
comparison was also made with the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test.
For simultaneous comparison of more than one group, a one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) test was used with post hoc analysis for pairwise
comparison of the subgroups. Two-way ANOVA test with multiple
comparisons was performed for Figure 6A. For survival analysis, data were
pooled from all mice assigned to the saline vehicle group (controls; n = 25),
mice assigned to the ABAH treatment group (n = 28), and MPO-deﬁcient
mice (n = 10). The analysis of the survival distribution was performed in
each group using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. A P value of ≤ 0.05 was
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. When not provided in the
manuscript text, the t-statistic, degrees of freedom, and F-statistic where
applicable are provided in Supplementary materials. The number of mice
used for each group was calculated to achieve a power of 90% (30%
difference in mean and standard deviation of 15%, resulting in n = 3 per
group). We used Graphpad Prism version 6.00 for statistical analysis
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA, www.graphpad.com).

RESULTS
Stroke Induction and Temporal Evolution of Infarct and Associated
Neuroinﬂammation
A subset of mice were serially imaged on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 21
after ischemia-reperfusion to evaluate infarct and the evolution of
MPO activity (Figures 2 and 3). Consistent with a previous
published study,19 MPO activity and neuroinﬂammation within
the infarct bed peaked between 3 and 7 days after middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) (Figure 3). The decline in MPO activity
was much more gradual compared with the change in infarct/
edema volume with diminished but persistent residual inﬂammation on day 21 (Figure 3A).

4-Aminobenzoic Acid Hydrazide Results in Inhibition of
Myeloperoxidase Activity In Vivo after Stroke Induction
4-Aminobenzoic acid hydrazide is a speciﬁc and irreversible
inhibitor of MPO activity.20 On day 1 after stroke induction, there
was no signiﬁcant MPO-speciﬁc enhancement and no signiﬁcant
difference between control and ABAH-treated mice (Figure 3).
Similarly, no signiﬁcant difference in infarct size was found at
1 day after stroke induction between the groups (Supplementary
Figure S2). However, on days 3, 7, 14, and 21, there was reduction
of MPO activity in the ABAH-treated mice based on the
semiquantitative CNR analyses of approximately 30% (day 3,

Figure 4. T2 lesion volumes on days 3 and 7 measured on T2w images. (A) Day 3 and (B) day 7 after infarct induction in wild-type mice treated

(n = 9). **P o0.01, ***P o0.001.

Figure 5. T2 lesion volume on day 21 is signiﬁcantly reduced after inhibition of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity for the entire 21-day period

volume (divided by the day 1 volume of restricted diffusion to correct for variations in infarct induction) shows signiﬁcantly reduced ﬁnal
volume in mice treated with 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH) (n = 11) or in MPO-KO mice (n = 9) compared with controls (n = 7).

P = 0.003, Mann–Whitney test), 19% (day 7, P = 0.07), 25% (day 14,
P = 0.05), and 46% (day 21, P o0.001), (Figure 3).
Consistent with the imaging ﬁndings and our previous
experiments demonstrating partial MPO inhibition with ABAH
in vivo,21 there was a signiﬁcant decrease in peroxidase activity in
the ABAH group (P = 0.05; Mann–Whitney test) with approximately
35% decline in peroxidase activity, similar to the 30% inhibition
found from MPO-Gd MRI.
Reduction of Myeloperoxidase Activity Results in a Decrease in
Infarct Volume
We next evaluated whether MPO inhibition affects infarct volume.
On days 3 to 7, during peak MPO activity, we found MPO
inhibition with ABAH reduced T2 hyperintense lesions. For day 3,
the reduction was 32% (45.1 ± 7.7 mm3 in the saline control group
compared with 30.5 ± 9.9 mm3 in the ABAH treatment group,
P = 0.31; Figure 4A). On day 7, the reduction was similarly at 33%
(27.0 ± 5.5 mm3 in the control group compared with 18.0 ±
7.1 mm3 in the ABAH-treated group, P = 0.39; Figure 4B). Interestingly, at these early time points, there was a much larger reduction
in the MPO-KO mice. On day 3, there was a reduction of 76%
(10.6 ± 3.2 mm3, P = 0.0005; Figure 4A). On day 7, the reduction
was 79% (5.6 ± 1.8 mm3, P = 0.0012; Figure 4B). On day 21, we
found ABAH signiﬁcantly decreased the ﬁnal lesion volume
(4.4 ± 0.7 mm3 in the ABAH-treated group compared with 10.9 ±
2.3 mm3 in controls, P = 0.0051; Figure 5A). Similarly, there was also
a signiﬁcant decrease in ﬁnal lesion volume in MPO-KO mice
compared with controls (3.96 ± 0.96 mm3, P = 0.0085; Figure 5A).
One-way ANOVA of all three groups with Tukey’s post hoc
analysis conﬁrmed the statistical signiﬁcance of these observations (P = 0.0020, F (2,24) = 8.2).
To ascertain that the observed outcomes were not secondary to
differences in experimental variations in the infarct induction
between groups, we calculated the difference in mean ﬂow
reduction during experimental stroke induction. We found no
signiﬁcant difference between the groups (Supplementary Figure
S3a). The day 1 infarct volume was likewise not signiﬁcantly
different between the three groups (Supplementary Figure S3b).
Finally, we also calculated the normalized day 21 lesion volume as
a percentage of the day 1 infarct volume on the ADC map to
account for any variations in the infarct induction. Consistent with
the above observations, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in the
normalized day 21 lesion volume in the ABAH group compared
with controls (P = 0.0013; Figure 5B). There was likewise a
signiﬁcant decrease in normalized day 21 lesion volume in MPOKO mice compared with controls (P = 0.0027). Once again, ANOVA
with Tukey’s post hoc analysis conﬁrmed these observations
(P = 0.0004, F (2,24) = 11.13).
Inhibition of Myeloperoxidase Activity Results in Improvement in
Clinical Outcome and Survival after Stroke
We next assessed the effects of reducing MPO activity on
behavioral outcome in three cohorts of mice, consisting of sham,
saline vehicle treated, and ABAH-treated mice. As expected, in
stroke mice treated with vehicle, there was signiﬁcant impairment
(P o 0.0001; Figure 6A). However, there was signiﬁcant improvement in behavior outcome in the ABAH-treated mice, which had
nearly normal functional outcome on day 21 with only a small
residual deﬁcit (P o 0.0001; two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons; Figure 6A). Similar improvement was seen in saline
vehicle (P o0.0001) or ABAH-treated (P o 0.0001) MPO-KO
mice compared with wild-type, saline vehicle-treated controls
(Figure 6A). Evaluation of interaction followed by multiple comparisons showed a strong statistically signiﬁcant effect of ABAH in
wild-type stroke mice but no signiﬁcant effect on the MPO-KO
background, further supporting the speciﬁcity of the intervention
to MPO blockage.

All groups except sham were compared using two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA). The sham group was compared using one-way
ANOVA. (B) Neurobehavioral testing results for days 3, 7, and 12.
Statistical signiﬁcance is shown for all groups compared with the

Furthermore, neurobehavioral improvement was evident at
different time points in ABAH-treated group and MPO-KO mice
compared with saline vehicle wild-type stroke mice, including
days 3, 7, and 21 after infarction (Po 0.0001; one-way ANOVA;
Figure 6B). In addition to improved outcome on neurobehavioral
testing, there was also an overall signiﬁcant improvement in
survival in the ABAH group compared with controls (P = 0.01;
Figure 6C). Of a total of 25 saline (control)-treated mice, only 18
survived, compared with 27 out of 28 ABAH-treated mice and 9
out of 10 MPO-KO mice.

Figure 7. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibition has the greatest impact when treatment was begun during the subacute stage of stroke (2 days)
and continued for 21 days. (A) Comparison of normalized T2 lesion volume shows signiﬁcantly smaller T2 lesion volume in the group treated
during the subacute compared with the acute stage. There was only a mild decrease in the average T2 lesion volume in the group treated
during the acute stage compared with controls (n: saline-treated controls = 7, acute = 5, subacute = 8). (B) Neurobehavioral evaluation on day
21 after infarction. Treatment with 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH) during the subacute stage confers the greatest beneﬁt, similar to
treatment during the entire (acute and subacute) periods as shown in Figure 5A. *P o0.05, **P o0.01, ****P o0.0001, ns = not signiﬁcant
(n: sham = 8, saline = 11, acute = 5, subacute = 8). Comparisons were made using the one-way ANOVA test.

Myeloperoxidase Inhibition During the Subacute Stage of Stroke
To assess whether the impact of MPO inhibition on infarct volume
is greatest when the inhibitor is given during the acute or
subacute stages, we administered ABAH either immediately after
MCAO on day 0 (acute stage), or starting on day 2 after stroke
induction (subacute stage). Subacute treatment resulted in signiﬁcantly smaller day 21 lesion volume (P = 0.0088; Figure 7A) compared with acute treatment. Both acute (P o 0.01) and subacute
(P o 0.0001) treatments improved the neurobehavioral outcome
on day 21 compared with saline-treated mice (Figure 7B), but
subacute treatment resulted in almost similar improvement as
that of treatment throughout the entire period (compare
Figure 6A with Figure 7B), and was signiﬁcantly better than treatment in the acute period alone (P o0.01; Figure 7B). Analysis of
variance with Tukey’s post hoc analysis conﬁrmed these observations (P o0.0001, F (3,28) = 0.318).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that progression of the ischemic lesion
beyond the initial 24-hour period is accompanied by persistently
elevated MPO activity in the untreated animals. Treatment with
the irreversible MPO inhibitor ABAH signiﬁcantly reduced the
infarct volume and improved neurobehavioral outcome, suggesting that MPO has an important role in infarct propagation and
associated tissue damage. Importantly, similar observations were
made in MPO-KO mice, and there was no additional beneﬁcial
effect of ABAH in MPO-KO mice, conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of
the ﬁnding and directly implicating MPO and its reaction products
in the underlying pathophysiology rather than as a bystander molecule or inﬂammatory marker without therapeutic
signiﬁcance.
Myeloperoxidase inhibition as a treatment strategy is unique in
that it appears to be most effective during the subacute stage of
stroke evolution. We found that ABAH can cross intact BBB and its
action is also likely enhanced by BBB breakdown in stroke.
Interestingly, neurobehavioral improvement is evident even
during the subacute stages of infarction on days 3 and 7 in
ABAH-treated or MPO-KO mice. Taking into account this observation and the fact there is signiﬁcant MPO activity on days 3 and 7,
this again implicates MPO activity as having a deleterious role in

infarct propagation, and suggests that treatment against MPO
would be beneﬁcial until MPO activity has subsided, at or beyond
the 21-day postinfarct period in our model.
In the absence of treatment, the ﬁnal infarcted area usually
includes the area of restricted diffusion and often the area
surrounding the restricted diffusion on DWI imaging.22,23,30 This
trend was reﬂected in the control saline-treated mice. However,
the average ﬁnal lesion was smaller in both ABAH-treated mice
and MPO-KO mice compared with the infarct volume on day 1
DWI imaging, suggesting that MPO inhibition or the absence not
only helps to prevent infarct propagation (secondary injury) but
may actually result in some reversibility of the initially injured area.
Myeloperoxidase promotes injury because of its pleiotropic role
in oxygen radical generation, inﬂammation, and vasomotor
function. It is a multifunctional enzyme that promotes oxidative
stress via its enzymatic products such as hypochlorous acid,
hypothiocyanous acid, and chlorotyrosine. These reactive species
can also modify lipids,31 activate metalloproteinases,32 and induce
BBB dysfunction.33 In addition to its direct enzymatic functions of
generating radicals and oxidizing agents, inhibiting its enzymatic
activity has been shown to decrease leukocyte recruitment and
ameliorate demyelination,21 indicating a role of MPO activity as a
positive feedback for promoting inﬂammation and damage. The
MPO molecule also has been shown to have a cytokine-like role in
signaling to attract neutrophils34 and delay neutrophil apoptosis35
to prolong inﬂammation. Myeloperoxidase-deﬁcient humans
exhibit preserved vasomotor function,36 further suggesting a role
for MPO in the integrity of vascular responsiveness.
Myeloperoxidase enzymatic activity depends on the presence
of hydrogen peroxide, likely generated from NADPH oxidase
activity. Therefore, MPO acts downstream of NADPH oxidase, a
major pro-oxidant enzyme in brain. Unlike NADPH oxidase, which
is membrane bound, MPO is secreted into the extracellular
environment and can exert its effects at a distance.37 While both
NADPH oxidase and MPO may be therapeutic targets in stroke,
NADPH oxidase deﬁciency results in chronic granulomatous
disease that often causes death at a young age. However, MPO
deﬁciency in humans does not signiﬁcantly impact life expectancy,38 making MPO potentially a better target for translation. We
also found that treatment with an MPO inhibitor during the
subacute stage conferred signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effects, demonstrating that MPO-mediated inﬂammation is most damaging

during the subacute stage of infarct evolution. Our conclusions
differ from those of Takizawa et al18 but are concordant with the
results from Matsuo et al.5 Our study provides longitudinal in vivo
data in living animals on imaging, neurobehavior, survival, and
different treatment regimens experiments that extend the
previous studies beyond day 1 after infarction. In our model,
MPO activity remains elevated on day 21, and both short-term and
long-term data are consistent with MPO inhibition/absence being
beneﬁcial for stroke.
Interestingly, we found a much larger reduction in infarct
volume on days 3 and 7 in the MPO-KO mice compared with
ABAH-treated mice. This may reﬂect less than ideal onset of
pharmacological inhibition. Moreover, the MPO inhibitor we used
for this study only suppressed MPO activity by 30%. This suggests
the need for developing more potent and faster acting MPO
inhibitors for future study. In this regard, the absence of a more
powerful long-term effect on injury volume in the KO mice could
be due to upregulation of other compensatory molecules in mice
that are congenitally devoid of MPO. For example, it has been
found that during sepsis there is increased inducible nitric oxide
synthase expression and nitric oxide production,39 as well as
increased T cell-mediated inﬂammation in MPO-KO mice.40 There
may also be a limit to the extent of improvement conferred by
MPO inhibition as other molecules and mechanisms have been
implicated in promoting additional damage41 including other
inﬂammatory pathways mediated by NADPH oxidase.42 Most likely,
our observations reﬂect a combination of these mechanisms.
In conclusion, our results show that MPO, a downstream effector
of the inﬂammatory cascade, is a key mediator of tissue damage
and secondary infarct propagation and consolidation in stroke.
Myeloperoxidase is therefore an attractive target mitigating tissue
damage, in particular during the subacute stage of stroke
evolution, during which few effective therapies currently exist.
