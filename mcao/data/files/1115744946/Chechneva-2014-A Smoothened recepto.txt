and promotes regeneration after ischemic brain injury

Ischemic stroke occurs as a result of blood supply interruption to the brain causing tissue degeneration, patient disabilities or
death. Currently, treatment of ischemic stroke is limited to thrombolytic therapy with a narrow time window of administration. The
sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway has a fundamental role in the central nervous system development, but its impact on
neural cell survival and tissue regeneration/repair after ischemic stroke has not been well investigated. Here we report the
neuroprotective properties of a small-molecule agonist of the Shh co-receptor Smoothened, purmorphamine (PUR), in the middle
cerebral artery occlusion model of ischemic stroke. We found that intravenous administration of PUR at 6 h after injury was
neuroprotective and restored neurological deficit after stroke. PUR promoted a transient upregulation of tissue-type plasminogen
activator in injured neurons, which was associated with a reduction of apoptotic cell death in the ischemic cortex. We also
observed a decrease in blood–brain barrier permeability after PUR treatment. At 14 d postinjury, attenuation of inflammation and
reactive astrogliosis was found in PUR-treated animals. PUR increased the number of newly generated neurons in the peri-infarct
and infarct area and promoted neovascularization in the ischemic zone. Notably, PUR treatment did not significantly alter the
ischemia-induced level of Gli1, a Shh target gene of tumorigenic potential. Thus our study reports a novel pharmacological
approach for postischemic treatment using a small-molecule Shh agonist, providing new insights into hedgehog signalingmediated mechanisms of neuroprotection and regeneration after stroke.

Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the main cause
of disabilities in industrial countries. Thrombolytic therapy with
tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only FDAapproved treatment of stroke. tPA clinical use is limited to a
narrow time window of safe administration and associated with
dangers of intracranial hemorrhage.1 Neuroprotective compounds, safe and effective when administered at later time
points after insult, remain to be identified.
The sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling has an essential role in
central nervous system (CNS) development,2,3 regulating the
generation and survival of neurons and oligodendrocytes.4–6
In the adult CNS, Shh is expressed in forebrain neurons and
astrocytes, cerebellar Purkinje and motor neurons.3 Shh
controls proliferation of neuronal progenitors and reactivity of
astrocytes.7–10 Perivascular astrocytes express Shh to maintain blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity.11
Shh is a morphogenic protein that binds to its 12-pass
transmembrane receptor Patched (Patched 1 (Ptch1) in
mammals) localized to the primary cilium in vertebrates. Ptch1
activation releases the inhibition of G protein-coupled receptor
Smoothened (SMO), allowing downstream nuclear translocation of Gli transcription factors, key regulators of the Shh
pathway.2 Non-canonical Shh signaling, lacking Gli-mediated
transcription, has also been reported.12

Shh signaling is activated in response to CNS injury, and the
time window and the cellular players involved is dependent on
the type and severity of insult. Multiple studies showed the
beneficial role of Shh signaling in various models of neurological conditions, including stroke,10,13–18 acute brain injury,19
Parkinson’s disease,20,21 Alzheimer’s disease,22 multiple
sclerosis and demyelination,11,23,24 spinal cord injury,25,26
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,27 and glucocorticoid-induced
cerebellar injury in neonates.28 However, the potential of
pharmacological activation of Shh signaling in injured CNS
and associated neuroprotective mechanisms are unknown.
Purmorphamine (PUR) is a purine-derivative smallmolecule agonist of SMO receptors.29 PUR was introduced
by Schultz and co-workers as an osteogenic compound for
differentiation of mouse mesenchymal progenitors into
osteoblasts.30 Using an in vitro amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
model, Peterson and Turnbull27 showed that PUR protected
hippocampal neurons against oxidative challenge. A barrierpromoting effect of PUR was reported in BBB–endothelial cell
culture model.11 To date, the therapeutic potential of PUR in
ischemic stroke has not been examined.
Here we investigated the neuroprotective and regenerative
properties of PUR in an experimental model of ischemic stroke.

We also characterized the ischemia-induced activity of
endogenous Shh signaling in the brain.
Results
PUR protects cortical tissue against ischemic injury. The
therapeutic time window of neuroprotective compounds is
critical in defining the success of stroke therapy. Dellovade
et al.15 described the ability of an agent of the hedgehog
pathway to reduce infarct volume and neurological deficits
when administered intravenously (i.v.) at 6 h after stroke. We
followed a similar poststroke treatment paradigm to examine
the neuroprotective activity of PUR. At 6 h after permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), animals were
injected i.v. with 1, 5 or 15 mg/kg of PUR or vehicle (VEH)
(Figure 1a). The infarct area was examined 2 days later using
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). A 40% reduction of
infarct volume was found in animals treated with PUR at
15 mg/kg compared with VEH (Figures 1b and c). A dose of

15 mg/kg of PUR was used throughout the study. Neuroprotective effect of PUR was abolished by preadministration of
SMO receptor antagonist cyclopamine (CyP; Figures 1b and c).
CyP alone did not affect the infarct volume when tested in a
pre- and post-MCAO treatment paradigm (Supplementary
Figure S1A). Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of PUR
at 6 h after stroke did not show neuroprotective activity
(Supplementary Figure S1B), presumably due to specific
pharmacokinetic properties of the compound.26
Adhesive-removal and rotarod behavioral tests revealed
improved neurological outcome after cerebral ischemia in
PUR-treated animals when compared with VEH. PUR
decreased the time required to sense (Figure 1d) and remove
(Figure 1e) adhesive 1 d after stroke and further improvement
in sensing was observed on day 2. No significant differences
were detected later (7 and 14 d post-MCAO) due to improved
performance in both groups. On the rotarod, PUR-treated
animals demonstrated enhanced motor function at 2 d
postinjury compared with VEH (Figure 1f). Differences were

still apparent at 4, 7 and 14 d post-MCAO. These findings
demonstrated that a single dose i.v. administration of PUR at
6 h after stroke was neuroprotective.
Shh signaling is upregulated in the cortex early after
stroke. To investigate the mechanism of PUR-induced
neuroprotection, we first characterized endogenous Shh
signaling after MCAO. We found that Shh mRNA was
transiently upregulated in ipsilateral and contralateral cortex
at 9 h and returned to control level by 12 h after injury

(Figure 1g). At 9 h after stroke, 90% of Shh+ cells in the
ipsilateral and contralateral cortex co-expressed neuronal
marker NeuN (Figures 2a and b,Supplementary Figure S1C).
Rare Shh+ astrocytes (Figure 2c, arrow) and endothelial cells
surrounded by perivascular astrocytes (Figure 2c, arrow
head) were detected in the ischemic cortex. Shh receptor
Ptch1 was predominantly expressed in neurons in the
ischemic cortex (Figure 2d) and occasional Ptch1+ neurons
were found on the contralateral side (Supplementary Figure
S1D). Some parenchymal (Figure 2e, arrow) and perivascular

(Figure 2f) astrocytes in the infarct area and on the
contralateral side expressed Ptch1. Ptch1+ endothelial cells
(Supplementary Figures S1E and F) and microglia
(Supplementary Figure S1G) were detected in the ipsilateral
cortex.
At 9 h after injury, Shh co-receptor SMO was predominantly
expressed not only in neurons (Figures 2g and h) but also in
perivascular and parenchymal astrocytes (Figure 2i), CC1+
oligodendrocytes (Figure 2j) and vascular endothelial cells in
the ischemic cortex (Figure 2k). SMO-negative endothelial
cells were also present in the ischemic cortex (Figure 2l). Gli1
mRNA was elevated in the ischemic area at 9, 12 and 24 h
postinjury (Figure 1h). Gli1 protein level of the nuclear fraction
was increased at 9 h after stroke (Figures 3f and g).
PUR inhibits apoptosis induced by ischemic stroke.
Cells in the ischemic core degenerate shortly after stroke,31
and at 6 h postinjury significant damage to brain tissue is
detectable.32 However, cells in the peri-infarct penumbra
undergo delayed apoptotic cell death and can be rescued by
neuroprotective treatment. We found a high number of TUNEL+
cells in the ischemic cortex of PUR- and VEH-treated animals
at 9 h after stroke (3 h after treatment) (Figures 4a and b).
The majority of apoptotic cells expressed NeuN (Figures 4a
and e, insert). At 24 h (18 h after treatment), a reduction of
apoptotic cell numbers was observed in PUR-treated animals

(Figures 4c–e). Cresyl violet staining confirmed that this
decrease was not due to cell death as no noticeable change
in cell density in the ischemic area was observed between
VEH- and PUR-treated groups at this time point
(Supplementary Figures S1H and J). A significant reduction
in the protein level of cleaved caspase-3 and pro-apoptotic
mediators Bad and Bax were detected in PUR-treated
animals at 24 h (Figures 4f and g). No differences in the
expression level of pro-survival factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL or
apoptosis-inducing factor were observed (Figures 4f and h).
Thus our data showed that late neuroprotection by PUR was
associated with inhibition of apoptosis.
PUR does not alter the stroke-induced level of Shh
signaling or inflammation. We next evaluated the involvement of Shh signaling molecules in the anti-apoptotic activity
of PUR by examining their expression in the ischemic cortex
at 3 h after treatment (9 h postinjury). No differences in the
mRNA level of Shh, Ptch1, SMO, Gli2 or Gli1 (Figures 3a–e)
were found between VEH and PUR-treated groups.
A reduction of Shh mRNA, however, was observed at 9 h
after stroke in the contralateral cortex of PUR-treated animals
(Figure 3a). No differences in the Gli1 or Gli2 protein level
between VEH- and PUR-treated animals were detected
(Figures 3f and g).

Inflammation triggers the activation of Shh signaling after
brain injury or in cancer cells.19,33 We found that mRNA levels
of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6, IL1β and TNF-α were
elevated in the ischemic cortex at 9 and 24 h after stroke
(Figures 3h–j). PUR did not affect the ischemia-induced level
of inflammatory mediators.
Neurons in the ischemic cortex express tPA shortly after
PUR treatment. To further investigate the underlying
mechanism of PUR-induced neuroprotection, we examined
the expression of several factors previously identified in
association with Shh-mediated responses.22,34 No differences
in the mRNA levels of pro-survival factor Bcl-2 (Figure 5a) and
neurotrophic factors BDNF (Figure 5b), NGF (Figure 5c) or
VEGFα (Figure 5d) were found between VEH- and PURtreated animals at 9 or 24 h after stroke. However, at 9 h after
MCAO, the mRNA level of Plat, encoding for tPA (Figure 5e),
and the tPA protein level were dramatically upregulated in the
ischemic cortex of PUR-treated animals (Figures 5f and g). At
24 h after injury, tPA mRNA and protein expression returned to
control levels. Notably, tPA proteolytic activity was reduced in
the ischemic cortex of VEH- and PUR-treated animals at 9 h

after stroke (Figures 5f and h). By 24 h, tPA activity was
significantly increased in PUR-treated animals. Early after
stroke, tPA was dominantly expressed by neurons in the
ischemic cortex (Figures 5i–k). No parenchymal but some
perivascular astrocytes expressed tPA at 9 h after insult
(Figures 5l and m).
Increased cerebrovascular permeability has been linked to
tPA activity after ischemic stroke.35 We examined whether
PUR-induced tPA expression affected BBB integrity. A
significant uptake of Evans Blue (EB) dye was detected in
the ipsilateral cortex of VEH-treated animals at 10 h after
MCAO, indicating the breakdown of BBB. Notably, BBB
permeability was reduced after PUR treatment (Figure 5n).
PUR attenuates reactive astrogliosis and inflammation
after stroke. Following an initial phase of stroke-induced
degeneration and inflammation, regenerative mechanisms
are initiated in the brain after MCAO.32,36 To promote
regeneration, a second injection of PUR was administered
at 4 d after insult (Figure 1a). Cortical tissue, including the
ischemic core and peri-infarct region, was collected at 7 and
14 d after stroke for analysis of Shh signaling, inflammation

and astrogliosis. Reactive astrocytes of the glial scar
expressed Shh (Figure 6a), Ptch1 (Figure 6b) and SMO
(Figure 6c) at 14 d after stroke. The mRNA levels of Shh
(Figure 6d) and Ptch1 (Figure 6e) were upregulated in the
ischemic cortex at 7 d with an additional increase at 14 d after
injury. Smo (Figure 6f) and Gli1 (Figure 6g) mRNA levels
were significantly elevated at 7 and 14 d. The mRNA level of
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of reactive
astrogliosis, was upregulated at 7 d after stroke (Figure 6h).
Treatment with PUR did not change the mRNA levels of Shh,
SMO or Gli1 (Figures 6d, f and g) but decreased Ptch1
mRNA at 14 d (Figure 6e). GFAP mRNA level was reduced at
7 d by PUR treatment (Figure 6h) and downregulated in both
VEH- and PUR-treated groups at 14 d. Analysis of the glial
Cell Death and Disease

scar tissue revealed a significant decrease of GFAP protein
expression in PUR- versus VEH-treated mice at 14 d
poststroke (Figures 6i–k,7h and i).
We further evaluated the effect of PUR on late stage
inflammation and found that th mRNA levels of the microglia/
macrophage marker CD11b (Figure 6l) and pro-inflammatory
cytokine IL6 (Figure 6o) were increased in the ischemic cortex
at 7 d but downregulated at 14 d after MCAO. Levels of mRNA
coding for CD45 (Figure 6m), TNFα (Figure 6n) and IL1β
(Figure 6p) were elevated at 7 and 14 d after stroke. Treatment
with PUR decreased CD45, TNFα and IL1β mRNA levels at
14 d postinjury (Figures 6m, n and p). Thus PUR treatment at
6 h and 4 d after stroke resulted in reduction of reactive
astrogliosis and late-stage inflammation.

PUR promotes regeneration after stroke. To study regenerative properties of PUR, we examined the expression of
neurite outgrowth protein GAP43,37 migrating neuroblasts
marker doublecortin (DCX)38 and synaptophysin, a marker of
synaptic plasticity,39 in the ischemic cortex at 14 d after
stroke. We found GAP43+ cells with neuroblast morphology
in the infarct area of VEH- and PUR-treated animals (Figures
7a and b, arrows). The majority of GAP43+ cells co-localized
with neuroblast marker DCX (Figure 7c). Numbers of GAP43,
GAP43/DCX and DCX+ cells were significantly higher in the
ischemic area of PUR-treated animals compared with VEH
(Figure 7d). DCX+ cell clusters and chains were located
along the corpus callosum (CC; Figure 7e) and in the striatum
(Figure 7f) of both VEH- and PUR-treated animals, suggesting their lateral migration from the subventricular zone (SVZ)
toward the ischemic area. Migrating cells were present in
close vicinity to blood vessels (Figure 7g). An elevated

expression of synaptophysin, was detected in PUR-treated
animals when compared with VEH at 14 d after stroke
(Figures 7j and k). Western blotting confirmed increase of
GAP43 and synaptophysin protein levels in the ischemic area
of PUR-treated animals at 14 d after insult (Figures 7h and i).
Shh signaling is involved in vascular reconstruction after
ischemic injury.10 We examined the effect of PUR on vascular
density and neovascularization in the peri-infarct and infarct
areas. Very rarely, vessels with newly formed (BrdU/CD31+)
endothelial cells were found in the peri-infarct area of VEHand PUR-treated animals (Figure 7l). In contrast, significant
numbers of BrdU/CD31+ cells appearing as single cells or as
part of large vessels were detected in the infarct area in both
groups (Figures 7m and n). Quantification showed an increase
of newly formed endothelial cells in the infarct area of PURtreated animals when compared with VEH (Figure 7o). No
difference in the density of CD31+ vessels was detected

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the smallmolecule SMO receptor agonist PUR is neuroprotective early
after stroke, reduces inflammation and astrogliosis and
promotes regeneration in the ischemic cortex at a later time
point after ischemic insult.

Discussion
Here we investigated the neuroprotective and regenerative
properties of the Shh signaling agonist PUR and identified
PUR as a potential candidate in ischemic stroke therapy. Our
results demonstrated a previously unappreciated role of Shh
signaling in neuroprotection via a novel tPA-dependent
mechanism, indicating that reiteration of a developmental
signaling pathway in the adult brain confers neuroprotective
and regenerative effects on injury associated with stroke.
We found that at 9 h after permanent MCAO, neurons in the
ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres upregulated the
expression of Shh, reinforcing previous reports of neuronal
Shh expression in the normal brain and early after
ischemia.9,16,40 Early after stroke, predominantly neurons
but also astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and endothelial cells in the ischemic area upregulated Shh receptors
expression. An increase of Gli1 in the ipsilateral cortex
indicated the activation of the Shh pathway early after stroke.
The elevated level of Shh on the contralateral side early after
MCAO was an interesting finding. Inflammation has been
identified to trigger Shh signaling.19 In support, an increase of
TNFα, IL1β and IL6 was detected in the ischemic cortex at 9 h
after stroke. However, the lack of inflammation and an
unchanged level of Gli1 mRNA on the contralateral side
suggest that inflammation is not the only trigger of Shh
signaling following stroke. Notably, the reduction of cerebral
blood flow occurring after MCAO in the contralateral
hemisphere41 could have a decisive role in the regulation of
Shh signaling activation.
Although the endogenous Shh pathway is activated in
response to stroke, its effect on cell survival remains unclear.
In our treatment paradigm, inhibition of Smo receptors with
CyP did not aggravate MCAO-induced cortical damage.
Similar observation was reported after epidural application of
CyP in an ischemia–reperfusion model.10 In contrast, intracerebral infusion of CyP immediately after permanent MCAO
has been shown to be deleterious.13 In our study, a single i.v.
administration of PUR at 6 h after stroke was neuroprotective
and restored neurological deficits induced by ischemic injury.
These findings point to the diverse role of endogenous Shh
signaling at various time points after stroke and highlight the
importance of defining a precise therapeutic time window for
the clinical use of Shh agonists.
Administered at 6 h after stroke, PUR targeted apoptotic
cells in the ischemic penumbra. The anti-apoptotic effect of
PUR was associated with increased expression of tPA in
penumbral neurons. tPA is a serine proteinase, which cleaves
the plasminogen to active plasmin, an enzyme responsible for
blood clot breakdown.42 In the brain, tPA is found in
association with an endothelial cell–astrocyte complex, where
it modulates cerebrovascular tone, functioning at low doses as
vasodilator and at high doses as vasoconstrictor,43 and
regulates the permeability of the BBB.44 Neuronal tPA is
involved in synaptic plasticity.45 tPA-induced Ca2+ influx
contributes to excitotoxicity, and tPA gene knockout has been
shown to be neuroprotective.46–48 Several studies demonstrated a beneficial role of tPA in neuronal and oligodendrocyte
survival.49–52 Liot et al.52 showed that tPA protects cortical
neurons against serum deprivation-induced apoptosis

through a mechanism independent of tPA proteolytic activity
or tPA receptors. Correa et al.49 demonstrated that tPA
contains a domain of significant homology with epidermal
growth factor and by binding to its receptors on oligodendrocytes inhibits apoptotic cell death after MCAO. Ischemic
preconditioning increases tPA enzymatic activity in cortical
and hippocampal neurons providing neuroprotection against a
subsequent lethal ischemic insult.50,51 Consistent with previous observations,53,54 we found that the enzymatic activity of
tPA was reduced in the ischemic cortex early after stroke.
However, at 24 h, tPA enzymatic activity was increased in the
PUR-treated group. The use of tPA in thrombolytic therapy of
ischemic stroke is limited due to adverse complications,
including hemorrhage.1,55 Notably, increase in tPA expression
(at 9 h) and activity (at 24 h) by PUR was associated with
neuroprotection and reduction of BBB permeability. Hence,
PUR may be an alternative for delayed stroke therapy,
potentially avoiding harmful side effects of tPA.
Concerning the safety of PUR as an agonist of potential
oncogenic Shh signaling,56 no evidences of neoplastic
transformation in peripheral or CNS tissues of PUR-treated
animals were observed. In our treatment paradigm, PUR did
not increase the level of Gli1 mRNA, associated with canonical
Shh signaling, giving additional credit to the potential safe use
of PUR in stroke therapy. Future studies on the possible
involvement of non-canonical Shh signaling, acting through
Gαi,57 are warranted.
Astrocytes respond to CNS injury by proliferation and
formation of the glial scar.58 The glial scar isolates damaged
area from healthy environment, fills the lesion cavity, reduces
immune cells infiltration and facilitates BBB repair.59,60 Glial
scar and an inflammatory environment, however, restrict
axonal sprouting and postinjury tissue regeneration.58,60
Reactive astrocytes express and self-respond to Shh that
stimulates their proliferation and glial scar formation.19,40 PUR
did not alter levels of Shh signaling molecules found at 7 d after
insult. However, a reduction of glial scar and decreased
immune cells’ infiltration and inflammation were observed in
the ischemic area after PUR treatment. Attenuation of
astrogliosis by PUR could result from neuroprotection. PUR
might also reduce the need for Shh signaling compensation by
reactive astrocytes and thereby limit their proliferation in the
injured CNS tissue. Additionally, PUR might directly affect the
function of immune cells, leading to subsequent downregulation of glial scar formation.
Treatment with PUR promoted tissue regeneration after
stroke. We found an increased number of neuroblasts in the
ischemic area after PUR treatment. The majority of neuroblasts expressed growth-associated protein GAP43, indicating an outgrowth of neurites and the formation of new axonal
projections.37 The origin of newly generated neurons found in
the ischemic area is an interesting question. A recent study
using a Cre-LoxP system to label SVZ-derived cells demonstrated that all new neurons found in the striatum after stroke
were generated in SVZ and migrated along the blood
vessels.38 In agreement, we observed chains of migrating
neuroblasts distributed from the SVZ toward the ischemic area
along the CC and striatum. Migrating cells were located in
close vicinity to vascular endothelium. PUR increased

neovascularization in the infarct area that supports neuroblasts migration and promotes tissue reconstruction.36
In summary, we have, for the first time, demonstrated the
potential of the small-molecule Shh signaling pathway agonist
PUR to protect cortical tissue and promote regeneration after
ischemic stroke. These findings provide important insights into
the role of Shh signaling in the adult CNS following ischemic
stroke and may open new avenues in stroke therapy.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes
of Health (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) guidelines for use of laboratory animals. All
animal protocols were approved by the University of California at Davis Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. All efforts were made to minimize the number of
animals used and to ensure minimal suffering. C57BL/6 male mice 9–12-weeks old
(The Jackson Laboratories, Sacramento, CA, USA) were used in this study.
Focal cerebral ischemia and drug treatment. Focal ischemia was
induced by permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) under
isoflurane anesthesia as described previously.61 Briefly, a skin incision was made
between the orbit and the ear. Under an operating microscope, the temporal muscle
was divided to locate the distal course of the left MCA through the translucent skull.
A small burr-hole craniotomy was performed with a microdrill (FST, Foster City, CA,
USA) and the exposed MCA was coagulated using a bipolar pencil (Kirwan Surgical
Products, Marshfield, MA, USA). Permanent occlusion was ensured by physical
division. Animals were randomly divided into groups and received a single dose of
1, 5 and 15 mg/kg of PUR or VEH (PEG-400: ethanol: water (40 : 20 : 40) i.v. or i.p.
at 6 h after MCAO. SHAM-operated animals were injected with VEH. CyP (10 mg/
kg) was administered 40 min before PUR (Figure 1a). To label proliferating cells,
50 mg/kg BrdU (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) in sterile 0.9% NaCl was
administered i.p. daily from 4 to 7 d after MCAO (Figure 1a). For tissue collection,
mice were anesthetized and perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
The ischemic area of the ipsilateral cortex and its contralateral counterpart was
isolated and stored in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis.
Behavioral assessment of neurological deficit. To assess somatosensory and motor function, an adhesive removal test was used as described
previously.62 Animals were trained for 5 consecutive days prior to MCAO
(Figure 1a). The time required to sense and remove adhesive was monitored at
each trial. Standardized rotarod test was used to assess motor function of balance
and coordination.63 Data were presented as the percentage to the time on the
rotator recorded at the last day of training. All experiments were conducted in a
blinded manner.
Analysis of infarct volume. Infarct volume was examined at 48 h after
MCAO using TTC and analyzed with correction for brain swelling as previously
described.64
Analysis of vascular permeability. BBB permeability was examined as
previously described.44 Briefly, EB was injected i.v. at 9 h after stroke and animals
were perfused with PBS 1 h later. Hemispheres were separated, weighed and
homogenized in 400 μl of N,N-dimethylformamide. Supernatants were collected
after centrifugation at 25 000 × g for 45 min. EB extravasation was detected as the
difference in absorbance at 620 nm and baseline absorbance (500–740 nm),
relative to the wet weight of each hemisphere.
RNA isolation and qPCR. To examine the mRNA expression levels of Shh
signaling molecules and target genes, we performed qPCR analysis as described
previously.65 Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using MultiscribeTM reverse
transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Subsequent qPCR
reactions were performed on a Roche Lightcycler 480 using SYBR Green Master
Mix (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) or validated TaqMan gene
expression assay (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantification of the fold-change
was performed by applying the 2 − ΔΔCt method and comparing Cp values
(calculated by a second-derivative maximum) of individual mice to sham-operated
control mice.66 Primer details are included in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell Death and Disease

Western blotting analysis. We isolated proteins from cortical tissues using
the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto PVDF
membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Gels were run under the same
conditions for all experimental groups. Blots were probed with specific antibodies
followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
and developed using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
β-Actin or Lamin B1 was detected for each membrane as the cytoplasmic or nuclear
protein loading control, respectively. The intensity of the bands was analyzed using
Image J (NIH). Data are presented as the relative ratio to the loading control. For
data display, representative bands cropped from the same blot are indicated by a
vertical separation line. Detailed information about primary antibodies is included in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Direct casein zymography for tPA activity. tPA activity was assessed by
direct zymography as described elsewhere.53,67 Briefly, proteins of cortical tissue
lysates were separated by electrophoresis on resolving gel (11% acrylamide)
containing 1 mg/ml casein and 13 μg/ml plasminogen (rPeptide, Bogart, GA, USA) as
substrates for plasmin and PA, respectively. The gel was washed and incubated for
4 h at 37 °C in 0.1 M Tris buffer to enable caseinolysis. Following Coomassie Brilliant
Blue R-250 staining, tPA activity was visualized as light bands resulting from casein
degradation on the darkly stained casein background. To avoid loading variations,
independent duplicate samples were analyzed by western blotting for β-actin.
Immunohistochemistry. Brain tissues were collected and prepared for
staining as described earlier.65 Nonspecific binding was blocked using 10% goat
serum in 0.1% Triton-X in PBS. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with
primary antibody, and specific binding was detected with secondary antibody Alexa
Fluor 488 or 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Primary antibody was omitted in
negative controls. Images were acquired on a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-E confocal
microscope using a D-Eclipse C1si camera (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY,
USA). Brightness was adjusted for some images to improve their presentational
quality without compromising data accuracy. For vascular density and neovascularization analysis, six sections per animal with an interval of 210 μm were stained for
BrdU and CD31. Animals from three independent experiments were included in the
analysis. Images were obtained in two 300 × 300 μm2 areas placed in the penumbra
or the infarct zone. Vascular density was calculated and presented as the percentage
of the area occupied by CD31+ vessels over the total area using Adobe Photoshop
CS3 (San Jose, CA, USA). BrdU/CD31+ cells were counted for neovascularization
analysis and presented as the mean number of cells per mm2. Analysis was
performed by blinded investigators. Detailed information on primary antibodies,
method of glial scar analysis and cell quantification is included in Supplementary
Materials and Methods and Supplementary Figures.
TUNEL staining. TUNEL assay was performed on 14-μm frozen tissue
sections using In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. To label neurons, sections were counterstained with NeuN.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA USA). Statistical significance of
the differences between means was evaluated using one-way ANOVA followed by
Turkey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Single comparisons were analyzed
by the Student’s t-test. All data were represented as mean ± S.E.M. Probability
values o0.05 were considered statistically significant.
