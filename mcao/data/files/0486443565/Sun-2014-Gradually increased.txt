Physical training is necessary for effective rehabilitation in the early poststroke period. Animal studies commonly use fixed training
intensity throughout rehabilitation and without adapting it to the animals’ recovered motor ability. This study investigated the
correlation between training intensity and rehabilitation efficacy by using a focal ischemic stroke rat model. Eighty male SpragueDawley rats were induced with middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion surgery. Sixty rats with successful stroke were then
randomly assigned into four groups: control (CG, 𝑛 = 15), low intensity (LG, 𝑛 = 15), gradually increased intensity (GIG, 𝑛 = 15),
and high intensity (HG, 𝑛 = 15). Behavioral tests were conducted daily to evaluate motor function recovery. Stress level and neural
recovery were evaluated via plasma corticosterone and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentration, respectively. GIG
rats significantly (𝑃 < 0.05) recovered motor function and produced higher hippocampal BDNF (112.87 ± 25.18 ng/g). GIG and LG
rats exhibited similar stress levels (540.63 ± 117.40 nM/L and 508.07 ± 161.30 nM/L, resp.), which were significantly lower (𝑃 < 0.05)
than that (716.90 ± 156.48 nM/L) of HG rats. Training with gradually increased intensity achieved better recovery with lower stress.
Our observations indicate that a training protocol that includes gradually increasing training intensity should be considered in both
animal and clinical studies for better stroke recovery.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the third cause of death after cancer and cardiac
diseases [1] and is the leading cause of adult disability in
many countries [2]. Ischemic stroke accounts for more than
80% of episodes among patients [1]. Hemiparesis is an inconvenient symptom common in stroke survivors. According
to the Hong Kong Authority Statistical Report 2009-2010,
the number of annual stroke admissions to public hospitals
increased from 24,743 cases in 2005 to 25,614 cases in 2009
[3]. A growing elderly population vulnerable to stroke [2, 4]
substantially increases medical care burden in Hong Kong
and the developed countries. Thus, effective rehabilitation
is essential to help stroke survivors regain impaired motor
function for improved quality of life.

Poststroke functional motor training, with repetitive
attempts to move paretic limbs, assists the stroke-damaged
efferent pathways more effectively in the subacute stroke
period when the brain network is sensitive to therapeutic
interventions [5]. Studies on efficacy, mechanism, and comparisons of training methods have been performed for many
years [6–8]. Training after stroke benefits motor function
recovery and promotes neurorehabilitation [8, 9]. Treadmill
training, a conventional and easy method, has been employed
in both human trials and animal models [10, 11]. Poststroke
treadmill training is continually used in rehabilitation due to
its effectiveness in both functional mobility and cardiovascular fitness in patients with chronic stroke [11]. Early treadmill
training could also reduce brain infarct volume and improve
neurologic function compared to spontaneous recovery in

2
stroke rat models [12, 13]. Moderate treadmill training could
upregulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [14].
BDNF is a protein discovered in the early 1980s which
is encoded by BDNF gene and expressed broadly in the
central and the peripheral nervous systems [15]. BDNF is one
member of the “neurotrophin” family of growth factors that
is believed to support the neuron survival and encourages
growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses
[16]. BDNF is active in the hippocampus, a region vital to
learning, memory, and higher thinking [17]. BDNF is related
to neuroplasticity contributing to motor learning, recovery,
and neural rehabilitation after stroke [5]. Stroke induces the
loss of motor function, and rehabilitation is the process of
relearning; thus, higher BDNF concentration in the brain
implies learning and neural rehabilitation [18].
Treadmill training can cause stress, leading to a series
of physical changes that inhibit neural recovery during
rehabilitation [19, 20]. Animals suffer from stress and actually develop similar pathology to humans [21]. Plasma
corticosterone (CORT) concentration is widely used as a
biomarker of stress in animal models [7, 22, 23]. CORT could
downregulate BDNF level in hippocampus [24]. Due to the
controversial function of treadmill training after stroke, it
is important to evaluate its effect on early stroke physical
rehabilitation and the relationship between training loads,
motor recovery, and stress levels. We, therefore, designed this
study to investigate these relationships via an ischemic stroke
rat model.
Intensity is thought to be a key factor in treadmill training
and is associated with stress. High-speed treadmill training
induces high CORT levels in a stroke rat model [18]. Stress
endurance is also enhanced by exercise [25]. Thus, stress
level may not only depend on training intensity but also
be influenced by subjects’ conditions. Moreover, adjusted
training intensity may be directly correlated to rehabilitation
outcomes.
Effectiveness of treadmill training intensity in motor
function recovery and neurorehabilitation has not yet been
completely elucidated. Both clinical and animal studies have
focused on fixed training intensity [26, 27]. It remains unclear
whether varied training intensity is more effective. In this
study, we employed a focal ischemic stroke rat model to
evaluate the effect of differing treadmill training intensities
on motor function recovery and neurorehabilitation. We
also analyzed CORT and BDNF levels in early stroke phase.
A gradually increased training intensity was designed to
investigate the relationship between intensity, motor recovery, and stress level. This study extends our understanding
of treadmill training intensity and influences rehabilitation
program design.

2. Methodology
Eighty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (between 2 and 3
months) weighing 280–360 g were used in this study. Rats had
free access to food and drink throughout the experimental
period. All procedures were approved by the “Animals Subject Ethics Sub-Committee” of the Hong Kong Polytechnic

BioMed Research International
University and conformed to the guidelines on the care and
ethical use of experimental animals [28].
Rats were trained for three days (Figure 1; accommodation protocol in Figure 2(a)) to become accustomed to
treadmill exercises. Rats unable to run on the treadmill were
removed from the experiment. After three days, rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion surgery
(MCAo/r) to induce ischemic stroke. After 24 hours, successfully induced stroke rats (n = 60) with motor impairment
using Longa’s test [29] and behavioral core between 1 and
3 were randomly assigned into 4 groups: control (CG, n =
15), low training intensity (LG, n = 15), gradually increasing
training intensity (GIG, n = 15), and high training intensity
(HG, n = 15). Rats in CG were fed in standard cages for
one week, while the rest underwent daily treadmill training
with different training intensities. LG rats were allowed to
run on the treadmill for 30 minutes with a 10-minute rest
between 10 minutes of running section at a velocity of
5 m/min. HG rats ran at 26 m/min with the same training
and rest regimens. Rats in GIG ran from 5 m/min on the
1st day (D1) up to 26 m/min on the last day (D7). Daily
behavioral scores were recorded via a skilled researcher
blind to group assignment. On the last intervention day,
rats were anesthetized and sacrificed via decapitation within
two hours after the last training. Trunk blood and brain
tissues from the hippocampus, striatum, and sensorimotor
cortex were collected. Trunk blood samples were immediately
centrifuged to acquire plasma. Brain tissue samples were
processed according to a standard BDNF sample preparation
protocol (Promega, USA). Plasma and brain tissue samples
were used for CORT and BDNF detection, respectively.
2.1. Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion/Reperfusion (MCAo/r)
Surgery. The MCAo/r surgery induced focal ischemic stroke
rat model by Koizumi [30] in 1986 was employed in this
study. Surgery mimicked practices by Ke et al. [7]. Briefly,
rats in all groups were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate
(0.4 mg/kg for induction and 0.02 mg subsequently). Incisions were made at the neck midline to expose the common
carotid artery (CCA), and then the external carotid artery
was ligated. Subsequently, a commercial filament with a
tip diameter of 0.39 ± 0.02 mm (Beijing Sunbio Biotech,
China) was inserted into the CCA and advanced along the
internal carotid artery until the tip of the filament reached the
middle cerebral artery. Occlusion lasted for 60 minutes after
which the filament was then withdrawn to allow reperfusion.
Six hours after MCAo/r surgery, rats were examined for
neurological deficit level using Longa’s test. For Longa’s test, a
score of 0 indicates no stroke and 4 represents severe stroke
[29]. Rats with a score between 1 and 3 were enrolled in the
experiment and kept in individual cages.
2.2. Treadmill Training Intervention. Treadmill training
intensity was suggested to affect memory function recovery
which is related to neural activity in the hippocampus [31].
Different training intensities bring different stress levels to
rats [7]. Velocity is a determining factor in intensity and
workload. Different velocities generated different training

intensities. In previous studies, training intensities mainly
were set from 2 m/min to 30 m/min and the daily training
time length was mainly set to 30 minutes [6, 8, 31]. In
this study, total training time was fixed at 30 minutes,
and 5 m/min and 26 m/min were chosen as low and high
treadmill training velocities, respectively. In LG and HG,
rats ran at a constant velocity through 7 days of training
at 5 m/min and 26 m/min, respectively. Rats are generally
weak the first several days after stroke but can spontaneously
recover [7], gaining better motor function with time.
Therefore, the study designated a rat group to gradually
increasing intensity from low speed (5 m/min) on the first
day to high speed (26 m/min) on the seventh day. Velocity
increased slowly in GIG the first four days, and for the
following three days, it increased relatively faster. The
training setup for all groups is shown in Figure 2(b).
2.3. Motor Function Test. Motor function improvement was
evaluated by the De Ryck behavioral test [32] on daily basis
throughout the 7-day intervention. Six out of eight tasks
evaluate functions including postural reflex, visual placing in
the forward and sideways directions, tactile placing of the
dorsal and lateral paw surfaces, and proprioceptive placing;
the other two tasks examine hindlimb’s tactile placing of
lateral paw surfaces and proprioceptive placing. The score for
each subtask ranges from 0 to 2 with the higher score indicating better motor function. Compared to normal rats, stroke
rats cannot place injured limbs normally. Thus, placement
function of injured forelimbs and hindlimbs was assessed
through the tasks by a skilled researcher blind to group
assignments.
2.4. Brain BDNF and Plasma Corticosterone Detection. Brain
BDNF and plasma CORT were evaluated using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [6, 7, 33, 34]. All
rats were anesthetized within two hours after the last intervention and sacrificed via decapitation. Trunk blood was
collected and centrifuged to obtain plasma. The brain was
carefully extracted from the skull, and brain tissues including
hippocampus, striatum, and affected sensorimotor cortex
were then obtained. BDNF Emax ImmunoAssay System
(Promega, USA) was used to measure BDNF concentrations.
Plasma CORT concentrations were quantified via Cayman’s
CORT EIA Kit (Cayman, USA).
2.5. Statistical Analysis. All results were expressed as means
± standard deviations. SPSS (IBM, version 20) was used
for data analysis and the level of statistical significance was
set at P = 0.05. Intention-to-treat analysis was used for any
rat that died during the intervention period. The ShapiroWilk test was used to examine the normality of all results.
Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with baseline as covariate and the Bonferroni post hoc
test were used to compare motor function scores. Oneway ANOVA test was used to compare CORT and BDNF
concentrations.

3. Results
Sixty rats underwent successful MCAo/r surgery that induced
motor impairment within 24 hours. Stroke rats were randomly assigned into 4 groups (CG, LG, HG, and GIG) with 15
rats in each group. Throughout the experiment, only one rat
in the GIG group died on the 6th day. Its behavioral scores on
the last two days were the same as that on the 5th day based
on the intention-to-treat principle. Results of behavioral
scores, CORT concentrations, and BNDF concentrations
are shown in Table 1. Through the Shapiro-Wilk test, all
results including behavioral scores, CORT concentrations,
and BDNF concentrations showed normal distributions (P >
0.05). All results were then used for further analysis.
3.1. Motor Function Recovery. Behavioral scores indicating
motor function recovery over the experimental period are
presented in Figure 3. Significant differences existed among
the four groups. GIG rats showed significantly higher behavioral scores from the 3rd to the last day compared to those
in the other groups. Rats in LG and HG also exhibited
significantly better motor function recovery from the 6th day
than the control.
3.2. Brain BDNF and Plasma Corticosterone Concentrations.
Hippocampal BDNF concentrations were significantly higher
than in both the striatum and cortex for all groups. GIG rats
showed the highest BDNF levels in the hippocampus and
striatum in Figure 4. Significantly different cortical BDNF
levels were observed between GIG and CG rats. BDNF levels
in LG and HG rats were not apparently different but were
significantly higher in the hippocampus and striatum than
CG rats (Figure 4). Figure 5 shows plasma CORT concentrations. Rats in the 3 training groups exhibited significantly
higher CORT levels over control. CORT levels in GIG rats
were significantly lower than HG but similar to LG.

4. Discussion
We show that treadmill training intensities for ischemic
stroke rats affect motor function recovery, BDNF concentration, and stress level over the 7-day intervention. We set up
three training intensity levels including low, high, and gradually increased intensity from low to high. Gradually increased
training intensity (GIG) induced significantly better motor
function recovery. Rats in this group showed similar stress
levels in comparison to LG, but BDNF concentrations in
brain tissues (hippocampus and striatum) were significantly
higher than LG. Rats in HG were stressed more than LG;
however, functional recovery rates were similar to LG and
significantly lower than GIG. Results indicated that rats with
treadmill gradually increased intensities better regain motor
function recovery.
Consistent with other studies, BDNF levels were lower
in striatum and cortex than in the hippocampus [7, 35].
The hippocampus plays an important role in learning and
memory, and rehabilitation is a process of relearning, making
hippocampal neurons active [17]. BDNF level is highly related

to neural survival, growth, and differentiation [16], probably producing a high hippocampal BDNF level. GIG rats
showed the highest BDNF concentrations in the hippocampus and striatum and had the best motor function recovery.
Importantly, we found a significantly positive relationship
(correlation coefficient: 0.537; P < 0.01) between motor function recovery rate and hippocampal BDNF concentrations
(Figure 6). BDNF has been used to treat photothrombotic
stroke rats and it improved motor function recovery when
compared to spontaneous recovery [36]. Other studies also
show that higher BDNF level in the brain indicates better
motor function recovery after stroke [7, 37]. Our results
remain consistent with those of previous studies. Significant

higher BDNF levels were found in GIG rats, leading to
significantly better motor function recovery. Similar BDNF
levels were observed in LG and HG rats that showed similar
motor function recovery.
Ploughman considered exercise brain food that ultimately enhances brain functions like memory and learning
[38]. Additionally, Ploughman et al. [39] suggest that moderate exercise has positive effects on physically disabled young
people aided by their high brain plasticity. Both prolonged
and short-term moderate exercises increase hippocampal
BDNF levels and brain mitochondrial biogenesis in rats
[14, 40, 41]. Physical training for stroke rat models was
reported to facilitate motor function recovery and upregulate

BDNF levels [42]. Four-week consecutive low-speed treadmill training started on the 4th day after stroke was found to
improve hippocampal function in a MCAo induced stroke rat
model [31]. Thus, exercise seems to upregulate brain BDNF
concentrations, a result supported by this study. Moreover,
GIG training improves BDNF production in brain tissues
after stroke, indicating better brain function recovery.
Early physical training facilitates rehabilitation after
stroke, but it is also a source of stress that mediates BDNF
regulation. CORT is a steroid hormone produced by the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and is released into the
blood. Adrenalectomized Wistar rats were used to investigate the time course and dose-dependency of CORT’s
effect on BDNF mRNA and protein, with results showing short-term corticosterone concentration changes having
transient and dose-dependent downregulation effects for
both hippocampal BDNF mRNA and protein [24]. Forced
treadmill training induces stress and has been suggested
to lower physical rehabilitation and BDNF levels in the
hippocampus compared to voluntary wheel running; yet it
still stimulates functional recovery [7]. Treadmill training
intensity could affect memory function recovery, while the
hippocampus determines memory function [31]. Training
intensity, thus, may affect hippocampal activity. Stress level
is highly related to training intensity. High training intensity
causes significantly high stress level, as a result of our study.

Figure 6: Correlation between hippocampal BDNF concentration
and motor function recovery rate. BDNF levels in the hippocampus
correlated with motor function recovery rate, meaning that BDNF
levels could indicate motor function recovery rate.

Hippocampal BDNF level could represent neural activity in
the hippocampus. Higher BDNF levels in the hippocampus
indicate better neural activity. Thus, stress level may correlate
with hippocampal BNDF level. On one hand, in this study,
consistent low and high training intensity induced low and
high stress levels associated with similar hippocampal BDNF
level; however, gradually increased intensity induced stress
levels between low and high intensities and close to low
intensity: stress may inhibit brain BDNF production. On the
other hand, rats with low training intensity were stressed significantly more than those without training but still exhibited
significantly better motor function recovery, suggesting that
stress was not the only factor mediating BDNF production
during rehabilitation. Exercise should be another important
factor determining rehabilitation outcomes. It could increase
muscle and brain mitochondrial biogenesis, strengthening
fatigue resistance and endurance performance [25]. In this
study, GIG training may better improve stress endurance and
it obtained better recovery. Training intensity, thus, should be
appropriately chosen for better recovery after stroke.
Repeated training is an important tool applied widely
in clinics and laboratories to improve recovery after stroke.
Intensity in forced training is a critical stress-inducing factor.
We thus designed a gradually increasing treadmill training
intensity regimen for stroke rats. We found that the training
intensity should be designed to match recovery rate and
minimize stress. Training with gradually increased intensity
can produce significantly better motor function rehabilitation
compared to stably low and high training intensity. We
extended the understanding of the importance of training
intensity in rehabilitation after stroke. A training protocol
that includes gradually increasing training intensity should
be considered in both animal and clinical human studies.
