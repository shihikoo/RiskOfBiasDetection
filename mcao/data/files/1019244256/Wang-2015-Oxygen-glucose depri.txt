a b s t r a c t
Cerebral ischemia occurs when blood ﬂow to part of the brain is obstructed, which can result in oxygen and
glucose deprivation (OGD) and neuronal damage. However, the mechanisms remain poorly understood.
The present study investigated the production and effects of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induced by
OGD in neuronal cells. By confocal microscopy, dsRNA containing B1 and B2 RNA, was found accumulating
in HT22 cells under OGD treatment. The sequence of B1 RNA was identiﬁed and transfected into HT22
cells. Interestingly, B1 RNA induced transcription and expression of NLRP3, interleukin (IL)-1␤, and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-␣, which was similar to the effects of OGD treatment. Moreover, HT22 cell growth
inhibition and proinﬂammatory cytokines production induced by OGD and B1 RNA treatment were downregulated by NLRP3 knock-down. These ﬁndings suggest that B1 RNA induced by OGD forms as dsRNA
and inhibits neuronal cell metabolic activity by regulating the NLRP3 and associated proinﬂammatory
cytokines production.

Cerebral ischemia (stroke) is an extreme condition of metabolic
stress originating from OGD that most commonly occurs when the
blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly blocked [3]. This cerebral ischemic injury leads to the oxidative stress, inﬂammatory
reaction, and eventually cell death. Until recently, no effective treatment could be used to promote recovery from stroke. Therefore,
the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cellular damage involved is an important focus of research to ﬁnd new strategies
to tackle this damage.
It has been widely accepted that inﬂammation and apoptosis
are primarily involved in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia

Fig. 1. dsRNA was induced by OGD in HT22 cells.
(A) HT22 cells were treated by OGD for 24 h. The dsRNA was stained by J2 antibody labeled with FITC. DAPI was used to indicate the location of nuclei. (B) IP assay was
performed using J2 antibody, which binds to dsRNA speciﬁcally. B1, B2 and B4 RNAs were ampliﬁed by RT-PCR assay using the cDNA from IP assay elution as a template. The
PCR production of B1 RNA was a smear from about 200 bp. Control is untreated HT22 cells, OGD 24 h is OGD treated HT22 cells for 24 h. (C) qRT-PCR was used to detect the
changes of B1 and B2 RNA level in HT22 cells after OGD induction. Values are mean ± SEM from at least four independent experiments. *P < 0.05 compared with 0 h. (D) BLAST
results of the sequence of B1 DNA (B1 sequence) from B1 RNA induced by OGD with B1Consensus using http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi [15] showed they were 94%
identical. (E) BLAST results of the sequence of B1 DNA with mouse B1 DNA (mouse repetitive sequence B1 DNA, GenBank: M18260.1) by http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi

[10]. Soon after cerebral ischemia, proinﬂammatory cytokines such
as TNF-␣, IL-1␤, and IL-6 are produced and secreted from brain
cells of injured tissue and mediate the inﬂammation and result in
the injury of ischemic cerebral tissues [2,4]. The NLRP3 inﬂammasome has been identiﬁed as a crucial complex in the pathology of
cerebral cell damage [16]. The NLRP3 inﬂammasome promotes the
activation of caspase-1, which cleaves pro- IL-1␤ and pro- IL-18 into
secreted forms which prime receptor activation, speciﬁcally mediating the inﬂammation damages of various cells [1,15]. However,

the activation of the NLRP3 inﬂammasome is not fully understood
in ischemic cerebral injury.
Short interspersed elements (SINEs) were thought of as “junk
DNA,” and were primarily used for analyzing phylogenetic relationships between organisms and speciation probing [12]. The
SINEs family includes Alu (about 11% in human [13]), B1, and B2
retroelements (in mouse) [8]. B1 sequence is shown to be scattered
throughout the whole genome of mouse, and only about a quarter
has the double-stranded conﬁguration in pre-mRNA [8]. B2 RNA

L. Wang et al. / Neuroscience Letters 588 (2015) 147–153

is identiﬁed to block Pol II from engaging the DNA and alter the
conformation of complexes at the promoter [17]. Moreover, SINEs
have been found to possess important biological functions [5,11].
Recently, the subtype of Alu RNA, which appears as dsRNA, has
been identiﬁed as a pathogenic factor. It also activates the NLRP3
inﬂammasome and triggers TLR-independent MyD88 signaling via
IL-18 in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) [15]. This revealed
a new mechanism in NLRP3 pathway activation and innate immune
regulation in tissue cells. Although NLPR3 has been recognized as
a vital molecule in the regulation of cerebral ischemic injury, its
origin and progression are still unclear. The potential mechanism
may provide promising targets for neuroprotective therapies.
In this study, neuronal cells were used to establish an OGD model
to investigate the production and roles of dsRNA and the relationship to the NLRP3 pathway. The B1 RNA sequences were identiﬁed
in dsRNA induced by OGD in HT22 cells. Then, we constructed a
pcDNA3.1-B1 plasmid to determine if B1 RNA could trigger the activation of the NLRP3 pathway to impact cell metabolic activity and
proinﬂammatory cytokines production during OGD treatment in
neuronal cells.

2.6. Western blot
Proteins extracted from HT22 cells were analyzed by western
blot as described in the Supplementary material.
2.7. Cell metabolic activity assay
MTS assays were performed to detect the metabolic activity of
cells using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The absorbance values were read at a wavelength of 490 nm on a
microplate reader (SUNRISE, TECAN). The assay was repeated three
times.
2.8. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Proteins were isolated from HT22 cells and IL-1␤ and TNF-␣
concentrations were examined by ELISA (R & D). For each sample,
20 ␮g of protein was used for detection according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The absorbance was read on a spectrophotometer
with a wavelength of 450 nm.

2. Methods
2.1. Cell culture and oxygen-glucose deprivation
HT22 cells were obtained from the Institute of Biochemistry
and Cell Biology, SIBS, CAS. The cells were cultured in DMEM high
glucose (Gibco), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (PAA
Laboratories) in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 ◦ C in the presence
of 5% CO2 in air. OGD was used as an in vitro model of hypoxicischemic injury. Brieﬂy, cells were placed in an anaerobic chamber
(ThermoForma, Model 1025), and the culture medium was replaced
with glucose-free DMEM bubbled with an anaerobic gas mixture
(95% N2 , 5% CO2 ) for 30 min to remove residual oxygen. Then, cells
were maintained in the anaerobic chamber at 37 ◦ C for 24 h to produce OGD. Cells were harvested and detected as following assays.
2.2. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice generation
and primary cultures of mice hippocampal neurons
The healthy, speciﬁc pathogen-free, adult male BALB/c mice
aged 8 weeks of age and weighing 22–30 g. Experiments were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Fourth Military Medical University. MCAO mice generation and primary cultures of mice hippocampal neurons were performed as
described in the Supplementary material.
2.3. Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy
dsRNA was detected by immunoﬂuorescence staining using the
procedure as described in the Supplementary material.
2.4. Isolation of dsRNA and real-time RT-PCR
HT22 cells treated by OGD were lysed. The dsRNA isolation
and real-time RT-PCR were performed according to the method as
described in the Supplementary material.
2.5. Plasmid generation and siRNA
B1 DNA sequence was cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 vector and
its sequence was conﬁrmed by PCR and sequencing analysis. HT22
cells were transfected by addition of pcDNA3.1-B1 or siNLRP3
(Santa Cruz) into the cell culture with Lipo2000 (Invitrogen). Following 24 h transfection, HT22 cells were analyzed as described.

2.9. Statistical analysis
The data are presented as mean ± SEM, and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0. Statistical evaluation of the
data was performed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons or unpaired t-test (two
groups). A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. dsRNA was induced by OGD in HT22 cells
Cerebral ischemia results in a range of pathogenic mechanisms
that are elicited by cellular energy depletion and oxidative stress.
We established an OGD model of HT22 cells to evaluate the changes
of dsRNA which might be induced by oxidative stress. Confocal microscopy revealed that dsRNA was increased and mainly
accumulated in cytoplasm of HT22 cells in 24 h treated by OGD
compared with control group (Fig. 1A).
3.2. dsRNA was composed by B1 and B2 RNA in HT22 cells after
OGD treatment
To recognize the dsRNA induced by OGD in HT22 cells, IP assay
was performed using J2 antibody. We found that B1 RNA was
increased in OGD treatment group, while B2 and B4 RNAs were
largely unaffected (Fig. 1B). qRT-PCR was performed to explore
changes of B1, B2, and B4 RNA in this experiment. The results
showed that B1 RNA was up-regulated from 8 to 24 h after OGD
treatment, while B2 RNA was not increased until 24 h (Fig. 1C). B4
RNA was not detected by qRT-PCR assay.
3.3. The sequence of B1 RNA induced by OGD in HT22 cells was
similar to mouse B1 RNA
By sequencing, we found that the dsRNA induced by OGD in
HT22 cells was similar to that of mouse B1 RNA. The main sequence
of OGD inducing B1 RNA was 215 bp, which conﬁrmed the result
shown as Fig. 1B. The sequence was subjected to BLAST and revealed
that OGD inducing B1 RNA was very similar to the mouse B1 consensus [8] and the B1 DNA sequence (mouse repetitive sequence
B1 DNA, GenBank: M18260.1) (Fig. 1D and E). This suggested that
B1 RNA might be one content of dsRNA induced by OGD in HT22

Fig. 2. The transcription and protein level of NLRP3, IL-1␤, and TNF-␣ in OGD treated HT22 cells.
The HT22 cells were treated with OGD as described in materials and methods. After OGD treatment for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h, HT22 cells were collected and prepared for qRT-PCR
and immunoassay to evaluate the contents and changes of NLRP3, IL-1␤, and TNF-␣. (A) qRT-PCR and western blotting assay of NLRP3. (B) qRT-PCR and ELISA assay of IL-1␤.

cells. Because of the low concentration of B2 RNA, we focused on
B1 RNA function for the remainder of this study.
3.4. NLRP3, IL-1ˇ, and TNF-˛ were up-regulated in OGD treated
HT22 cells
To explore the effects of OGD in HT22 cells, we detected the
changes of NLRP3, IL-1␤, and TNF-␣ by qRT-PCR and immunoassays. NLRP3 expression increased from 8 to 24 h during OGD
treatment as shown in Fig. 2A. Since IL-1␤ and TNF-␣ are activated
by the NLRP3 pathway in the innate immune system during inﬂammation, it was expected to ﬁnd that they also increased from 12 to
24 h under OGD treatment (Fig. 2B and C) in HT22 cells.
3.5. NLRP3, IL-1ˇ and TNF-˛ were primed by B1 RNA
To understand the roles of B1 RNA that was induced by OGD
in HT22 cells, the sequence of B1 RNA was acquired by immunoprecipitation assay. Accordingly, the DNA sequence was ampliﬁed
by PCR and inserted into a plasmid to generate pcDNA3.1-B1. HT22
cells were transfected by pcDNA3.1-B1 to explore the function of B1
RNA. The transfection effect and dsRNA transcription were shown
in Fig. 3A by immunoﬂuorescence assay. Interestingly, the transcription and expression of NLRP3 was induced by pcDNA3.1-B1
transfection after 24 h in HT22 cells (Fig. 3B). pcDNA3.1-B1 transfection also resulted in IL-1␤ and TNF-␣ production, which was
similar to the results obtained by OGD treated HT22 cells (Fig. 3C
and D).

3.6. B1 RNA and OGD inducing HT22 cells metabolic activity
inhibition and proinﬂammatory cytokines production were
down-regulated by NLRP3 knock-down
HT22 cells metabolic activity was measured by MTS assay. The
results exhibited that OGD and B1 RNA resulted in decreased HT22
cell metabolic activity. Furthermore, we also found that the cell
metabolic activity inhibitory effects from OGD and B1 RNA were
suppressed signiﬁcantly by NLRP3 knock-down (Fig. 3E). These
ﬁndings suggested that B1 RNA expression induced by OGD, which
mediates the NLRP3 pathway activation, is involved in HT22 cell
metabolic activity inhibition. To conﬁrm the production of NLRP3
associated proinﬂammatory cytokines in pcDNA3.1-B1 transfected
HT22 cells, we detected the expression of IL-1␤ and TNF-␣ by ELISA
following NLRP3 knock-down. The results revealed that the production of IL-1␤ and TNF-␣ was reduced by NLRP3 knock-down in
pcDNA3.1-B1 transfected HT22 cells (Fig. 3F). This decrease may
have released the inhibitory effects of pcDNA3.1-B1 on HT22 cell
metabolic activity.

3.7. B1 RNA and NLRP3 were upregulated in mice neuronal cells
The MCAO mice model was established to observe the dsRNA
and NLRP3 expression in neuronal cells in vivo. The immunoﬂuorescence results showed that dsRNA and NLRP3 were increased
in cytoplasm of the hippocampal neuronal cells of MCAO mice
(as shown in Fig. 4A). In this assay, we noticed that dsRNA and
NLRP3 were also increased in the cytoplasm of some microglia (data

HT22 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-B1 as described in materials and methods. After 24 h of pcDNA3.1-B1 transfection, HT22 cells were collected and prepared for

not shown). Then primary mice hippocampal neuronal cells were
harvested to detect the B1 and NLRP3 expression in OGD treated
primary mice hippocampal neuron. The results indicated that B1
(isolated as dsRNA) and NLRP3 were upregulated in the OGD treated
primary mice hippocampal neuronal cells (Fig. 4B). Furthermore,
the pcDNA 3.1-B1 transfection resulted in the NLRP3 upregultion
and metabolic activity inhibition of primary mice hippocampal
neuronal cells. And those effects could be partially blocked by

NLRP3 knock-down, which presented the similar consequence
within those in HT22 cells (Fig. 4C and D).
4. Discussion
In this study, we ﬁrst identiﬁed that dsRNA is up-regulated and
accumulates in the cytoplasm of OGD induced neuronal cells. Furthermore, we analyzed the composition of dsRNA and found that B1

Fig. 4. dsRNA and NLRP3 were upregulated and inhibited the metabolic activity of mice neuronal cells under MCAO and OGD treatment.
(A) The immunoﬂuorescence assay was performed to detect the production of dsRNA (labled by CY3) and NLRP3 protein (labled by FITC) in the hippocampal tissue of MCAO
mice. (B) IP assay was carried out to isolate dsRNA by J2 antibody after 24 h in OGD treated primary hippocampal neuronal cells. B1 RNA (in dsRNA) and NLRP3 (in total

co-transfected neuronal cells (24 h). *P < 0.05 compared with Con group, **P < 0.05 compared with pcDNA3.1-B1 group. Values are mean ± SEM from at least four independent

and B2 RNA expressions increased during OGD treatment in HT22
cells. Speciﬁcally, B1 RNA is increased more than that of B2 RNA in
the early stage of OGD treatment. Next, we acquired the B1 RNA
sequence from the dsRNA pool which was eluted in IP assay and
compared it with the mouse B1 RNA consensus, which was reported
previously. The results indicated that the sequences of OGD induced
B1 RNA and mouse B1 RNA are very similar. Although it has been
shown that Alu RNA plays a vital role in the degeneration of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), the assembly and functions of Alu
RNA and other dsRNAs in neuronal cells has not been reported.
Here, we demonstrate that B1 RNA forming as dsRNA accumulated
in neuronal cells during OGD induction. Further work is needed to
describe the components and function of B1 RNA induced by OGD
in neuronal cells in detail.

After cerebral ischemia, a multifaceted inﬂammatory reaction
emerges over the next few hours. Numerous inﬂammatory mediators are produced, including cytokines and chemokines, which then
release further proinﬂammatory factors contributing to the inﬂammatory reaction. Recent studies have demonstrated that NLRP3
plays an important role in cerebral ischemia [7], in which NLRP3
is activated by extracellular and intracellular stimuli. Many studies have provided evidence that NLRP3 and MyD88 are involved in
ischemic injury [14], which is consistent with our current results
showing that the transfection of B1 RNA induced the transcription
and expression of NLRP3, IL-1␤, and TNF-␣, which were similar
to the effects of OGD treatment. Furthermore, the cellular effects
induced by OGD and B1 RNA were partially reversed by NLRP3
knock-down. These ﬁndings suggest that B1 RNA induced by OGD

L. Wang et al. / Neuroscience Letters 588 (2015) 147–153

could inhibit HT22 cell growth by regulating the NLRP3 pathway.
Studies gave evidences that microglia are exquisitely sensitive to
brain injury [6]. Tumor necrosis factor and IL 1 are upregulated
early in peri-infarct microglia to participate the progression of
brain inﬂammation [9]. Here, we also found that dsRNA and NLRP3
were increased in some microglia, which may arouse the inﬂammation roles of microglia in cerebral ischemic injury. Further work
is needed to describe the mechanism in detail. These results not
only provide an explanation for a novel function of dsRNA, but also
for a novel intrinsic mechanism of the NLRP3 pathway activation
in cerebral ischemic injury.
5. Conclusion
This study provides evidence that, in neuronal cells, OGD
may induce the accumulation of dsRNA to prime the NLRP3 and
proinﬂammatory cytokines production, which were involved in
the inﬂammatory progression and injuries of cerebral ischemia.
Although the molecular mechanisms associated with dsRNA and
the NLRP3 pathway are not fully understood, this study provides
insight into the conditions and features of cell metabolic activity inhibition and a new theory describing the development and
progression of cerebral ischemia.
