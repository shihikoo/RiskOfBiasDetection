a b s t r a c t
Animal models are useful tools for better understanding the mechanisms underlying neurological deterioration after an ischemic insult as well as subsequent evolution of changes and recovery of functions.
In response to the updated requirements for preclinical investigations of stroke to include relevant functional measurement techniques and biomarker endpoints, we here review the state of knowledge on
application of some translational electrophysiological and neuroimaging methods, and in particular, electroencephalography monitoring and magnetic resonance imaging in rodent models of ischemic stroke.
This may lead to improvement of diagnostic methods and identiﬁcation of new therapeutic targets, which
would considerably advance the translational value of preclinical stroke research.

1. Introduction
Much of the medical progress of understanding the dynamics
of diseases, their underlying mechanisms and the development of
therapeutic strategies has come from animal studies. Preclinical
investigations with animal models of stroke are highly valuable
for gaining a comprehensive understanding of brain activity and
functions, for characterizing ischemic tissue fate, and for offering
new possibilities for reinstatement of lost functions (Braeuninger
and Kleinschnitz, 2009). In ischemic stroke in humans, thrombosis or embolism occludes a major cerebral artery, most often
the middle cerebral artery (MCA), causing a focal cerebral infarct.
Therefore, this brain vessel is the artery mostly targeted to induce
focal cerebral ischemia by its occlusion (MCA-occlusion (MCAO)
models) in preclinical studies, which have demonstrated that the
ischemia-induced changes closely resemble those seen in ischemic
stroke patients. The principal mechanisms of ischemia, including complex cellular and molecular cascades, are well established
and have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (e.g., Lipton, 1999;
Xing et al., 2012). Occlusion of the MCA may be performed in
animals by intraluminal insertion of a pro-thrombotic agent or a
ﬁlament, ligation, cauterization, photothrombosis or extraluminal
application of the potent vasoconstrictory peptide endothelin1 (Et-1). Detailed characteristics, advantages and disadvantages
of the different models of MCAO, and various output measures
to characterize the consequences of ischemia in these models
have been described elsewhere (Carmichael, 2005; Durukan and
Tatlisumak, 2007; Braeuninger and Kleinschnitz, 2009; Howells
et al., 2010; Macrae, 2011; Liu and McCullough, 2011; Roulston
et al., 2012).
Functional behavioral tests are an essential part of preclinical research to assess the animal’s functional status after stroke.
Behavioral tests that have been used in animal stroke research
have been extensively described in previous reviews (e.g., DeVries
et al., 2001; Schallert, 2006). These tests have for instance been
used to measure unilateral MCAO-induced sensorimotor deﬁcits
in contralateral fore- and hindlimbs, including paralysis or weakness, loss of muscle tone and coordination, and lack of response to
sensory or proprioceptive stimuli. These behavioral impairments
correspond with loss of function in cerebral areas that are supplied by the MCA, i.e., the somatosensory cortex, most of the
motor cortex, lateral and medial segments of the caudate-putamen,
and the pyramidal tract. There is conﬂicting evidence regarding
a correlation between deﬁcits in sensorimotor functions and the
volume of MCAO-induced hemispheric infarction (see references
in Hunter et al., 1998). It is believed that damage of speciﬁc functional regions better predicts functional outcome than total infarct
volume (DeVries et al., 2001). Therefore, for effective and comprehensive examining of consequences of cerebral ischemia as well as
for preclinical drug testing, behavioral endpoints should ideally be
complemented with neural correlates that can explain functional
output.
Nowadays, a bulk of techniques and approaches exists to
measure functional changes in the brain after stroke. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
techniques are among the most widely applied in clinical and
preclinical research. Despite a long history of EEG application in
clinical practice and the important role it has played in studying
cerebrovascular diseases (reviews of Faught, 1993; Jordan, 2004;
Foreman and Claassen, 2012), relatively few preclinical studies
have adopted EEG measures as quantitative surrogate markers
for brain dysfunction in stroke models (Table 1). Besides the
accumulated knowledge about the complex electrophysiological
processes triggered by ischemia at cellular level (Astrup et al., 1981;
Hossmann, 1983; Krnjević, 2008), we are not aware of any recent
review on changes in the gross intrinsic bioelectrical activity, i.e.,

23

EEG, recorded in preclinical models of stroke. On the contrary,
a large number of reviews have been published on application,
beneﬁts and pitfalls of various MRI techniques in animal models of stroke (Dijkhuizen and Nicolay, 2003; Farr and Wegener,
2010; Denic et al., 2011; Hoehn et al., 2001; Hoehn, 2011; Duong,
2012; Obenaus and Ashwal, 2012). Interestingly, electrophysiological (EEG, local ﬁeld potentials, unit neuronal activity) and functional
MRI (fMRI) measures may be combined in the same experimental
setting (Logothetis et al., 2001), which can signiﬁcantly contribute
to improved understanding of (changes in) brain function in health
and disease. This has been demonstrated in studies on epilepsy,
sleep and cognition (e.g., Duyn, 2012), and recently also after stroke
in human patients (Dubovik et al., 2012) or in experimental animal
models (van Meer et al., 2012).
The purpose of this literature review is to summarize ﬁndings
of studies using EEG and MRI measurements in animal models of
focal cerebral ischemia, and to speculate on future directions in this
ﬁeld.

2. EEG in preclinical stroke studies
2.1. EEG in rodents
The physiological basis and technical aspects of EEG have been
largely reviewed in the literature (e.g., Schaul, 1998; Amzica and
Lopes da Silva, 2010). In animal experiments, electrodes can be
placed on calvarium (epidurally or subdurally) for recording of electrocorticogram, or inserted into brain structures for recording of
local ﬁeld potentials or electrosubcorticogram. These recordings
reﬂect gross electrical activity emanating from summated extracellular excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents in dendrites
of cortical pyramidal cells (e.g., Speckmann and Elger, 1999). The
acronym EEG will be used to indicate electro(sub)corticogram, local
ﬁeld potentials and EEG for the remainder of this article, although
it is recognized that differences do exist between data obtained
from each of these measurements. The EEG in healthy animals,
including rodents, exhibits a spectrum of oscillation frequencies
and various patterns mostly dependent on the functional state
during the different phases of the ultradian cycles of sleep and
wakefulness. For example, low-frequency and high-voltage oscillations dominate the slow wave sleep pattern, while during waking
state the EEG is asynchronous and with low-voltage oscillations.
The intrinsic (background) EEG activity recorded in normal conditions when the animal is awake, quiet and immobile (i.e., in a
“resting state”), is regulated by a homeostatic system, involving
dynamic interactions among anatomically dispersed brain regions
of different brain structures, such as brainstem, thalamus, limbic
areas, and cortex, which play an important role in a wide variety
of behavioral functions. EEG activity in animal studies has conventionally been described in terms of a set of frequency bands,
usually deﬁned as delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz)
and beta (12–30 Hz). The distribution of the fast Fourier transformation spectrum among these four frequency bands normally
is 25–45%, 40%, 12–15% and 3–20%, respectively, in the total frequency band (usually from 1 to 30–32 Hz) (e.g., Lu et al., 2001;
Zhang et al., 2013).
A bulk of algorithms have been developed to process the
EEG signals, extracting a variety of EEG features in order to
obtain reliable alerting indices of possible cerebral pathology.
Some of the quantitative EEG .approaches and spectral parameters include: fast Fourier transformation of the EEG signal;
absolute power spectral density across the total frequency band;
percentage distribution of total power into delta, theta, alpha
and beta frequency bands (relative power); alpha-to-delta ratio
(Zhang et al., 2013) or ratio between alpha + beta and delta + theta

Continuous EEG recording before and during
the ﬁrst 6 h after MCAO and then at 24 h or
72 h after MCAO in freely-moving rats. More
than 60% drop in the EEG power at 30 min
post-MCAO (used as an inclusion criterion).
Appearance of NCS (rhythmic spiking of
1–3 Hz), PLED and IRDA 1 h after MCAO and
then up to 3d both in permanent and transient
models, but in tMCAO model, these EEG
abnormalities ceased after reperfusion.
Before, during MCAO, at 1 h (immediately after
halothane), and at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h.
(nonanesthetized rats). A drop in EEG power at
1 h (except delta band) used as conﬁrmation of
a successful occlusion. Frontal, parietal and
occipital electrodes bilaterally. NCS during the
ﬁrst hour of occlusion, attenuated during
reperfusion, when PDA appeared. Delta power
increase correlates with neurological deﬁcits
and infarct volume.
Beginning from 10 weeks after MCAO
-continuous (1-week) EEG recording at 3, 7,
and 12 months after MCAO (freely-moving
rats). No spontaneous EEG seizures detected
up to one year.
EEG in penumbral region before and up to
280 min after MCAO in anesthetized rats
(isoﬂurane). EEG power suppression
immediately after MCAO to 30% of baseline,
recovering to 50% at 90 min, no full recovering
up to 180 min.
2 h after MCAO and then at 2 mo, 4 mo, 6 mo
and 12 mo (freely-moving rats). Spiking in
some animals, but epilepsy developed in only 1
rat (out of 35) during 6 or 12 months of
monitoring.
Within 6 months after MCAO (freely-moving
rats)
Control rats: spontaneous focal and
generalized SWDs.
Ischemic rats: the ictal SWDs (absence seizures
accompanied with motor arrest of the animals)
are less frequent and shorter duration
compared with non-ischemic rats, and the EEG
power in 7–15 Hz frequency band decreases
compared with controls. No evidence of
stroke-induced epileptogenesis.
Before, during MCAO surgery and ﬁrst 1 h of
reperfusion (anesthetized rats) and then at 6 h,
12 h, 24 h, 48 h post-reperfusion
(freely-moving rats). Severe voltage depression
and diffused EEG slowing as earlier as 1 min
after MCAO ipsilaterally in striatum and
hippocampus.
Anesthesia and MCAO provoked a 2.5-fold
increase in delta power in all regions. Decrease
in theta power.
Before and at 1 h, 4 h, d1, d3, d7, d
14–freely-moving rats. In penumbral S1FL
region: EEG drops by ∼20% below the
pre-ischemic power at 1 h and 4 h. Then, an
increase in power of the slow delta waves
(PDA). No complete resolution of the spectral
EEG proﬁle until day 14 after Et-1.
Before and at d1, d 3, d 5, d 7, d 14, d 21, d 28

It should be mentioned that EEG measurements in rodents are
limited by several factors, such as (1) restricted number of EEG electrodes for recording because of small rodents’ head dimensions;
(2) ambiguity of correct placement of the reference electrode; (3)
poor source anatomical localization in epidural EEG recordings; (4)
intensive amount of time required for the analysis of signal characteristics, etc. Nevertheless, EEG measures are highly sensitive to
dynamics of functional changes in brain tissue, and provide indispensable, sensitive and affordable means for detecting neuronal
dysfunction, and EEG retains a useful place in the evaluation of
processes induced by cerebral ischemia.

2.2. EEG in rodent stroke models
EEG measurements in rodent stroke models have resulted in
important ﬁndings that have contributed to the elucidation of
mechanisms of functional consequences of focal cerebral ischemia,
as summarized in Table 1. The EEG ﬁndings cited in this table have
been acquired from different rodent MCAO models, from different
brain regions, and at various time points after stroke. The poststroke time points of EEG recordings in these studies vary from
hyperacute (<1 h), acute (1–24 h), subacute (1–10 days), to intermediate and chronic (>10 days) (according to stages deﬁned by
Andrews (1991)).
The conventional approach in EEG investigations in preclinical
stroke models is to delineate power in the EEG spectral bands, and
draw relevant inferences from frequency-dependent changes in the
EEG oscillations. For example, after transient MCAO, the balance of
delta, theta, alpha and beta powers has been shown to be altered
(85%, 7%, 5% and 3% of the total EEG power, respectively) during
the acute phase of ischemia, resulting in signiﬁcant decrease of

S.G. Moyanova, R.M. Dijkhuizen / Brain Research Bulletin 102 (2014) 22–36

the alpha-to-delta ratio (Williams et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2013).
The most frequently reported EEG changes during the subacute and
chronic phases of transient MCAO have been an increase in delta
and a reduction in alpha and beta EEG power across the entire ipsilateral hemisphere (Moyanova et al., 1998, 2007, 2008, 2013; Lu
et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2013). The loss of fast EEG rhythms and
appearance of focal slow wave activity are supposed to be due to
dysfunctional or pathological neural tissue and impaired network
communication in affected cortical/subcortical regions (Gloor et al.,
1977). For assessment of stroke-induced EEG changes and recovery, the whole spectrum EEG power have been compared to that
before MCAO (Schmid-Elsaesser et al., 1999; Lei et al., 2004; Paul
et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013), during MCAO (Phillips et al., 2000),
or during the EEG suppression hyperacutely after MCAO (Williams
et al., 2000; Moyanova et al., 2011).
Abnormal EEG patterns (characterized in details in the clinical stroke literature, e.g., Andraus and Alves-Leon, 2011) that have
been reported in EEG studies in rodent MCAO models include:
polymorphic slow-wave delta activity; intermittent rhythmic
delta activity consisting of readily identiﬁable brief (<10 s) rhythmic large-amplitude bursts in the 4–7 Hz range; non-convulsive
seizures, electrographically deﬁned as rhythmic discharges with
spike components of 1–4 Hz frequency; occasional rhythmic spikeand-wave or polyspike discharges, not accompanied by motor
convulsions; periodic lateralized epileptic discharge, consisting of
interictal spikes; and sharp or slow waves recurring with a variable
period of 1–8 s (Williams et al., 2000, 2003; Williams and Tortella,
2002; Hartings et al., 2003) (Table 1). Rodents have been shown
to exhibit non-convulsive seizures predominately during the ﬁrst
hour after ﬁlament MCAO (Williams et al., 2000), and their appearance might attribute to the abrupt mechanical occlusion of MCA,
because such abnormal EEG patterns have not been observed in
the Et-1 MCAO model (Moyanova et al., 2007), where the occlusion
by Et-1 is gradual.
The high variability in the size and spatial extent of cerebral
ischemic lesions in various focal cerebral ischemia models affects
functional output measures including the EEG pattern. Rodent
strain, vessel anatomy, degree and duration of arterial occlusion,
are among the variables that determine the extent of ischemic
injury and the brain’s functional status in rodent MCAO models
(Table 1). Different EEG patterns have been recorded after transient
proximal MCAO (Bolay and Dalkara, 1998; Williams et al., 2000,
2003; Williams and Tortella, 2002; Lu et al., 2001; Bao et al., 2001;
Frigeni et al., 2001; Hartings et al., 2003; Karhunen et al., 2003;
Lei et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2006; Paul et al., 2012; Zhang et al.,
2013; Bhattacharya et al., 2013); permanent proximal MCAO (Lu
et al., 2001; Guyot et al., 2001; Hartings et al., 2003; Lämmer et al.,
2011); permanent distal MCAO (Bolay and Dalkara, 1998; Kelly
et al., 2006), and transient MCAO induced by Et-1 (Moyanova et al.,
1998, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013; Karhunen et al., 2006), as summarized in Table 1. Quite different EEG results have been reported in
transient and permanent occlusion models, for example, the polymorphic delta EEG activity has been found to be less expressed after
transient MCAO model as compared to the permanent MCAO model
(Lu et al., 2001; Hartings et al., 2003).
The localization of the recording electrodes with respect to the
site of ischemic injury critically affects the EEG pattern. Attempts
to differentiate between EEG parameters recorded from areas representing the ischemic core, penumbra, and remote regions have
been made in only a few studies. For example, quasi-topographic
mapping of EEG spectral values from several cortical regions
after permanent or transient MCAO in rats has demonstrated that
abnormal EEG patterns were spatiotemporally different: while
the cortical parietal region (peri-infarct) was dominated by sharp
waves and/or spike-wave complexes, the EEG in temporal cortical
regions (ischemic core) was severely depressed at 24 h after MCAO

27

(Lu et al., 2001). Interestingly, diffuse polymorphic delta activity has
been reported to appear predominantly in the peri-infarct parietal
cortical region after transient MCAO and to a lesser degree in the
temporal cortical region representing the ischemic core (Williams
et al., 2003). In another study, suppression of the EEG power during
the hyperacute phase after Et-1 infusion near to the MCA was found
to be greater in ischemic core regions (barrel ﬁeld of the somatosensory cortex, and granular ﬁeld of the insular cortex) than in the
penumbra (forelimb region of the somatosensory cortex) and outside the lesion territory (primary visual cortex) (Moyanova et al.,
2011). In the same study, the suppression of the EEG amplitude was
shown to recover ﬁrst in the region outside of the infarct, then in
the penumbral region, and much later or not at all in the ischemic
core.
EEG recording may not be limited to cortical tissue, as studies
in animal models also allow intracerebral insertion of electrodes in
subcortical structures. In stroke models in which subcortical brain
regions are part of the ischemic territory, e.g. after intraluminal
ﬁlament occlusion of the proximal part of the MCA, subcortical EEG
recordings have demonstrated ipsilaterally a drop in EEG amplitude
as earlier as one minute after MCAO and a signiﬁcant increase in
delta and theta power (Zhang et al., 2006).
Permanent or temporary occlusion of the MCA at its distal
part through a subtemporal craniotomy induces primarily cortical
infarction (Brint et al., 1988). Despite the craniotomy, long-term
EEG recordings are feasible, as has been shown by Kelly and coworkers who recorded EEG from frontal and parietal cortical areas
in freely-moving rats for 6 months after MCAO (Kelly et al., 2006, see
Table 1 for the results). Using this model, Bolay and Dalkara (1998)
demonstrated with electrophysiological measurement of electrocorticograms and somatosensory- and motor-evoked potentials
that cortex and caudate-putamen were differently affected by the
vessel occlusion, and that motor dysfunctions after recirculation
might be due to persistent transmission failure at cortical synapses
and blockade of electrical impulses at the subcortical level during
ischemia.
The two main EEG characteristics in relation to ischemiainduced alterations are the suppression of all EEG waves during
the hyperacute phase (from several minutes to 1–2 h), and late EEG
slowing during subacute to semichronic phases of ischemia (1–10
days). The next two subsections will discuss speciﬁc early and late
EEG patterns in response to ischemia-reperfusion in more detail.
2.2.1. Early ischemia-induced EEG suppression
The electrical function of the brain depends critically on the
CBF and oxidative metabolism of glucose, delivered to the brain
tissue via the arterial blood supply. Occlusion of the MCA leads
to reduction of CBF in the brain territory supplied by the artery.
The critical need of sufﬁcient oxygen delivery leads to failure of
synaptic transmission, which has been proposed to account for
electric silence in the ischemic core and penumbra (references
in: Hofmeijer and van Putten, 2012) and thus, for the severe
reduction in the EEG amplitude observed during the hyperacute
phase of ischemia in MCA-occluded rodents (Table 1). Speciﬁc
electrical changes accompanying the progressive neuronal dysfunction have been applied to determine the thresholds of CBF after
ischemia as follows (Astrup et al., 1981; Heiss, 1983; Hossmann,
1983): 20 ml/100 g/min–decreased amplitude of somatosensory
evoked potentials; 18 ml/100 g/min–abnormal EEG, loss of fast frequencies; 15 ml/100 g/min–increases in slow frequencies, loss of
postsynaptic evoked responses; 12 ml/100 g/min–EEG ﬂat, loss of
presynaptic evoked responses. Signiﬁcant reduction in the EEG
power one hour after permanent MCAO has been found to correlate
with >30% CBF reduction as measured by combined laser Doppler
ﬂowmetry adjacent to the EEG electrode (Guyot et al., 2001). In
rodent MCAO models, the degree of the EEG amplitude reduction

28

S.G. Moyanova, R.M. Dijkhuizen / Brain Research Bulletin 102 (2014) 22–36

in the hyperacute phase of ischemia was shown to be between 20%
and 80% dependent on the model used and on the duration of the
vessel occlusion (Bolay and Dalkara, 1998; Schmid-Elsaesser et al.,
1999; Phillips et al., 2000; Williams et al., 2000; Hartings et al.,
2003; Lei et al., 2004; Moyanova et al., 2007, 2011). Therefore, some
investigators have conﬁrmed success of MCAO in rodents based on
the EEG suppression over the ipsilateral somatosensory and motor
cortical areas during the hyperacute phase of ischemia (Phillips
et al., 2000; Williams et al., 2000; Hartings et al., 2003). This criterion has been conﬁrmed by the observation that rats without
signiﬁcantly decreased EEG amplitude in the ipsilateral hemisphere
during or immediately after MCAO, revealed no ischemic tissue
damage a few days later (Frigeni et al., 2001). The potential of
(hyper) acute EEG changes to predict on stroke outcome has not
been fully explored and requires further investigations.

changes in excitability and metabolism observed in contralateral
hemisphere following unilateral stroke (Andrews, 1991).
EEG studies that describe post-stroke signal changes in the contralateral hemisphere are sparse. An increase in EEG delta activities
has been found in the contralateral sensorimotor cortical areas at
1–7 days after the MCAO in rodents (Lu et al., 2001; Williams et al.,
2003; Hartings et al., 2003; Moyanova et al., 2013). In addition, an
increase in EEG asymmetry (spectral density-derived brain asymmetry index) between ipsilateral and contralateral EEG power, has
been shown to coincide with increase in behavioral asymmetry
(Moyanova et al., 2013).
Improved knowledge of bioelectrical activity patterns in the
unaffected hemisphere would help to understand its putative role
in functional compensation and recovery after unilateral stroke.

2.2.2. EEG changes after reperfusion
In the transient ﬁlament MCAO model, the re-establishment of
blood ﬂow following the mechanical retraction of the ﬁlament is
abrupt, which may lead to hyperperfusion. Although reperfusion
restores supply of oxygen and nutrients to previously ischemic
brain tissue, reperfusion may also exacerbate ischemic injury by
generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to so-called “reperfusion injury” (Aronowski et al., 1997; Pan et al., 2007). The effects
of reperfusion on brain EEG oscillations have been incompletely
characterized. Some EEG abnormalities (e.g., nonconvulsive rhythmic spikes), which were present during 2 h MCAO, were shown to
disappear after reperfusion, while other abnormal signals, such as
polymorphic and intermittent rhythmic delta activities, remained,
which the authors associated with reperfusion injury (Hartings
et al., 2003). In another study, polymorphic delta activity in periinfarct regions of the ipsilateral parietal cortex was shown to
increase following reperfusion after MCAO (Lu et al., 2001). In the
Et-1 MCAO model, reperfusion is spontaneous and gradual, because
the vasoconstrictory effect of Et-1 gradually wears off. The duration
of the perfusion deﬁcit in this model ranges from 80 min (Robinson
et al., 1991) to 7–16 h (Biernaskie et al., 2001) depending on the
dose of Et-1 and the site of CBF measurement. Gradual reperfusion as observed in the Et-1 model is believed to closely resemble
the situation in human stroke (Biernaskie et al., 2001; Roulston
et al., 2012) than the mechanically induced reperfusion in ﬁlament
MCAO models. The only abnormal EEG pattern recorded during the
subacute reperfusion phase after Et-1 MCAO was the polymorphic
delta activity (Moyanova et al., 1998), while non-convulsive abnormal EEG patterns related to reperfusion have been observed in the
ﬁlament MCAO model (Hartings et al., 2003, Table 1).
Prolonged longitudinal EEG studies after stroke could give information on temporal evolution of ischemia-induced consequences
and progression of recovery processes. Long-term EEG monitoring
during the chronic phase of stroke (>10 days) in animal MCAO models (Table 1: Moyanova et al., 1998, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013; Phillips
et al., 2000; Karhunen et al., 2003; 2006; Kelly et al., 2006; Lämmer
et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013), has demonstrated different time
courses of EEG impairments and recovery depending on the model
and recording site. The ﬁndings of gradual restoration of EEG patterns are in line with the concept of functional brain plasticity and
neuronal network reorganization, which may be further studied
by combined and serial multifunctional assessment of behavioral,
electrophysiological and imaging outputs.

3. Magnetic resonance imaging in preclinical stroke studies

2.2.3. EEG changes in the contralateral hemisphere
Focal brain ischemia has consequences for the whole brain. Partial damage of a neuronal network may also functionally impair
remote regions, as well as induce compensatory remodeling of
connected intact areas (Rema and Ebner, 2003). For example,
“transhemispheric diaschisis” has been termed to describe cortical

3.1. MRI of acute stroke
Various imaging strategies are available in clinical and preclinical settings to assess structural and functional injury after stroke,
including positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
and MRI (e.g., Baird and Warach, 1998; Kilpatrick et al., 2001;
Dijkhuizen et al., 2012).
CT is the most widely available neuroimaging modality in clinics and is typically used to detect the presence of early subtle acute
ischemic signs, to rule out hemorrhage and/or angiographically
detect the vascular occlusion site. Despite its practicality for acute
stroke diagnosis, CT, however, may not directly detect ischemic tissue injury until at least 6 h after stroke onset (Baird and Warach,
1998). Recent advances with dynamic CT perfusion have enabled
the assessment of the hemodynamic state of the ischemic brain
tissue in stroke patients (Eastwood et al., 2003), potentially providing a correlate of the ischemic penumbra. Although CT is not
frequently utilized in experimental stroke studies, CT perfusion has
also been successfully applied in rats (Nikolova et al., 2009), and
new CT techniques have recently been introduced, such as microCT and nano-CT (Langheinrich et al., 2010; Hayasaka et al., 2012),
which may be capable to evaluate dynamic and evolving processes
after experimental stroke in more detail.
PET allows quantitative measurement of cerebral blood ﬂow
and metabolism in human patients as well as animal models, and
remains the imaging gold standard for identiﬁcation of potentially
salvageable tissue, i.e. the ischemic penumbra (Baron, 1999; Heiss,
2000; Virdee et al., 2012). Nevertheless, this technique is usually
not applied in clinical routine due to complicated procedures, invasive methodology, complex logistics, limited access and exposure
to radioactivity.
Throughout the world, MRI is increasingly used for clinical
stroke diagnosis, because of its noninvasiveness and versatility.
Furthermore, translational studies in scientiﬁc laboratories have
more frequently involved MRI than PET and CT. Despite the advantages of MRI, it should be noted that the equipment is expensive,
massive, immobile and not uniformly available in laboratories and
clinics.
MRI does not expose the organism to potentially harmful ionizing radiation and thus is easy to serially repeat. It can be used to
characterize the evolution of the stroke lesion “in vivo” by monitoring edema, perfusion, and vascular morphology (see Table 2
for applications in animal models of stroke). Infarcted tissue with
extracellular edema can be identiﬁed with T2 -weighted MRI methods, which is a robust means to detect ischemic infarctions at
subacute to chronic stages. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)
and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) allow detection of acute

Limb dysfunction after stroke was related to
loss of brain activation in the ipsilesional
sensorimotor cortex. Restoration of function
was associated with biphasic recruitment of
peri- and contralesional functional ﬁelds in the
brain: at 3d–extensive activation-induced
responses in the contralesional hemisphere, at
14d–reduced involvement of the
contralesional hemisphere, the focus of
activation returned to the ipsilesional cortex.
Even a short ischemic event of 15 min duration

ischemia-induced cerebral changes within minutes after stroke.
Dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced imaging is the most
widely used PWI approach, which is based on dynamic imaging of
the ﬁrst passage of an intravascularly injected exogenous paramagnetic MRI contrast agent (Calamante et al., 1999b). Alternatively, an
arterial spin-labeling technique, which measures perfusion based
on signal from endogenous arterial blood water (Detre et al., 1994),
can be used to quantify CBF loss after stroke. Perfusion imaging
methods are used to estimate the hemodynamic status of ischemic
tissue, whereas ﬂow in larger vessels can be assessed using MR
angiography. DWI allows detection of disturbances of cellular water
homeostasis, which is one of the ﬁrst elements of the pathophysiological cascade leading to ischemic tissue injury (Sevick et al.,
1992). DWI contrast is based on tissue water’s apparent diffusion
coefﬁcient, from which the location and volume of early ischemic
tissue changes may be determined. For a detailed description of the
principles and applications of these methods we can refer to many
previous reviews (Hoehn et al., 2001; Dijkhuizen and Nicolay, 2003;
Farr and Wegener, 2010; Denic et al., 2011; Duong, 2012; Obenaus
and Ashwal, 2012).
Translational stroke research with MRI may signiﬁcantly
contribute to improvements in stroke diagnostics and therapeutics. Numerous studies with animal models of stroke have been
performed in search of neuroprotective and neurorestorative therapies that may help stroke victims (e.g., review by Howells et al.,
2012). Unfortunately, however, translation of neuroprotective
beneﬁts from the laboratory bench to the emergency room has
not really been successful (Sutherland et al., 2012). To determine
whether treatment can be beneﬁcial, there is a need for an objective means of assigning tissue status at the time of ischemic stroke
diagnosis, in other words, a need for advanced diagnostics that
can identify the presence of salvageable tissue at risk of infarction.
This refers to the concept of the ischemic penumbra. Originally,
the ischemic penumbra was deﬁned on an electrophysiological
basis as brain tissue with impaired electrical activity but preserved
cellular metabolism and viability (Astrup et al., 1981). The differentiation of “salvageable, penumbra” versus “nonsalvageable, core”
in ischemic tissue may allow optimal selection of patients who
could beneﬁt from acute therapeutic intervention. Therefore, over
the years, a variety of MRI strategies have been proposed by which
regional CBF, and tissue status can be measured and analyzed to
identify the ischemic penumbra, and to trace its evolution towards
irreversible injury or its spontaneous or therapeutically induced
resolution. For example, the so-called “perfusion-diffusion mismatch” (area with abnormal PWI signal and normal DWI signal)
has been introduced in the clinic to deﬁne salvageable tissue
at risk of infarction (Schlaug et al., 1999). PWI–DWI mismatch
regions have also been identiﬁed in animal stroke models (Meng
et al., 2004; Henninger et al., 2006). Many studies have used
PWI and DWI in transient MCAO models to assess early and late
ischemia/reperfusion-induced changes in the brain (Table 2),
which has contributed to our current knowledge of distinct traits
of stroke pathophysiology such as cytotoxic edema development,
prolonged hyperemia, secondary tissue injury after reperfusion,
etc. (see reviews by Baird and Warach, 1998; Dijkhuizen and
Nicolay, 2003; Duong, 2012). The evolution of the PWI–DWI mismatch region has been reported to differ between experimental
models (Henninger et al., 2006) and animal strains (Bardutzky
et al., 2007), and several studies suggest that the PWI–DWI mismatch may not be adequate to predict the outcome of ischemic
brain tissue, and uncertainty remains about the signiﬁcance of
perfusion and diffusion changes and their relationship (see review
by Wardlaw, 2010). Recently introduced predictive algorithms
that combine and weigh various tissue and perfusion parameters
obtained with MRI could signiﬁcantly improve the sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of identiﬁcation of potentially salvageable tissue

31

after stroke (Ostergaard et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010). Promising
methodological developments have been successfully tested and
applied in preclinical studies in animal stroke models (Bouts et al.,
2013), and await further evaluation in human stroke patients.
3.2. Functional MRI of brain reorganization after stroke
Structural MRI methods enable construction of relatively static
tissue maps and provide anatomical and basic pathophysiological information. They are based on the fact that different types of
tissue (e.g. skull, gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal ﬂuid)
have different MRI-detectable biophysical properties, which may
change under pathological conditions. On the contrary, functional
imaging methods allow construction of dynamic maps of processes
and responses in brain tissue. These methods are based on the
fact that neural activity leads to local physiological changes in the
brain. The most widely applied functional imaging technique is
fMRI. The physical principles and application of fMRI after stroke
have been described in previous reviews (Dijkhuizen and Nicolay,
2003; Weber et al., 2006; Dijkhuizen et al., 2012). Neural activity increases oxygen consumption, which triggers an increase in
blood ﬂow to that region and a change in local tissue oxygenation.
This has been termed the BOLD effect (for blood oxygenation leveldependent contrast; Ogawa et al., 1990). Neuronal activity induces
a BOLD effect with a characteristic time course, which is known
as the hemodynamic response function. FMRI enables acquisition
of functional activation maps with a relatively good combination
of temporal (up to subsecond) and spatial resolution (up to submillimeter), and is gaining acceptance as a research method for
assessing spatiotemporal changes in brain activity in relation to
pathophysiology and behavioral recovery in neurological disorders.
The use of fMRI in animal models has been particularly advantageous in preclinical and translational studies of stroke recovery
(Dijkhuizen et al., 2001, 2003; Markus et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2005;
Weber et al., 2008).
FMRI studies may involve imaging during task- or stimulusrelated activation paradigms, or imaging without any presentation
of stimuli, i.e. resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI), which can be applied to
assess the integrity of functional areas and networks in post-stroke
human or animal brain (Grefkes and Fink, 2011; Carter et al.,
2012; Dijkhuizen et al., 2012). Stimulus-related fMRI activation
studies in animal stroke models have relied on techniques that are
weighted by cerebral blood volume responses (Dijkhuizen et al.,
2001, 2003) or BOLD responses (Kim et al., 2005; Weber et al.,
2008). The cerebral blood volume-weighted fMRI measurements
provide high contrast-to-noise ratio, but require injection of an
intravascular contrast agent. BOLD fMRI is noninvasive and has
been used in the vast majority of human fMRI studies. A recent
development in rs-fMRI, which assesses spatial correlations of
spontaneous fMRI signals within neural networks, has allowed
measurement of intrinsic functional connectivity in the brain. The
principle of rs-fMRI is based on detection of synchronizations of
BOLD low frequency ﬂuctuations of less than 0.1 Hz. Assessment of
spatiotemporal signal correlations, for example with independent
component analysis, allows identiﬁcation of functionally connected brain networks. Rapid current developments in acquisition
and analysis methods are continuing to improve the accuracy,
reproducibility and utility of rs-fMRI (van den Heuvel and Hulshoff
Pol, 2010; Smith, 2012). During the last years, a bulk of rs-fMRI
studies have appeared, which reported on functional connectivity
patterns and neural network topology in humans, non-human
primates (Beckmann et al., 2005; Moeller et al., 2009) and rodents
(Hutchison et al., 2010). These studies have for instance demonstrated the existence of a default mode network and several
bilaterally organized networks that correspond with functionally homologous hemispheric brain areas. The examination of

32

S.G. Moyanova, R.M. Dijkhuizen / Brain Research Bulletin 102 (2014) 22–36

functional connectivity in brain disorders, such as stroke, may be
particularly relevant because it could provide new and important
insights into functional brain reorganization in relation to loss and
recovery of functions (Carter et al., 2012). Studies in a rodent stroke
model have shown that functional connectivities in structurally
intact brain regions are disrupted after focal cerebral ischemia, but
can gradually recovery, reﬂective of functional network remodeling
(van Meer et al., 2010a,b, 2011, 2012). Importantly, connectivity
changes within the bilateral sensorimotor cortical network were
shown to be correlated with changes in sensorimotor function,
suggesting a tight interrelationship between functional network
connectivity and behavioral output.
Clinical practice has shown that a large proportion of stroke
patients experience at least some degree of spontaneous recovery.
Resolution of neurological deﬁcits after stroke may occur through
changes in the structure, function, or connectivity of surviving neurons. These processes are believed to develop during subacute to
chronic stages. Most stroke studies in patients and animal models,
however, have typically been performed during the ﬁrst hours or
days after stroke (Table 2). To better understand the evolution of tissue injury and the impact of neuroprotective and neurorestorative
therapeutic interventions, it is important to investigate the temporal proﬁles of structural and functional brain parameters, e.g.,
obtained from imaging studies, for longer time periods. Recent longitudinal MRI measurements, including rs-fMRI, diffusion tensor
imaging and contrast-enhanced vascular MRI, after MCAO in rats
have already provided exciting new insights into brain plasticity
processes like alterations in functional network topologies, white
matter remodeling and revascularization (Seevinck et al., 2010;
van Meer et al., 2012; Boehm-Sturm et al., 2013). Importantly,
parenchymal, vascular and functional parameters can be studied
with multiparametric MRI in a single experimental session. Longitudinal structural, functional and vascular MRI studies could help to
elucidate mechanisms that underlie the reversibility or irreversibility of functionally impaired tissue after ischemia. Furthermore, it
can aid in clarifying to what extent improved performance following therapy is due to recovery of the affected brain area and/or
to functional reorganization of peri-lesional and/or remote (contralesional) neuronal networks in the brain (Dijkhuizen et al., 2001,
2003; Sicard et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2010;
Johnston et al., 2012).
To summarize, continued methodological advances in brain
imaging with MRI are likely to extend and deepen our understanding of cerebrovascular disorders, e.g., ischemic stroke. Integration
of neuroimaging approaches into experimental setups would further illuminate pathophysiology, provide guidance for early or late
interventions, facilitate prediction of stroke outcome and treatment response, and could lead to clinically applicable protocols for
the development, screening and monitoring of therapeutic strategies. This may be effectively achieved in multiparametric studies in
animal models of stroke by fusion of modern structural, molecular
and functional imaging methods with electrophysiological techniques.

4. Combination of EEG and MRI in preclinical stroke studies
4.1. Combined EEG and MRI acutely after stroke
Valuable data in terms of quality and quantity can be obtained
by the combination of complementary techniques such as EEG and
MRI. The EEG signal is limited by low spatial resolution, whereas
MRI can provide relatively high spatial resolution (within millimeters). On the other hand, EEG monitoring provides superb temporal
resolution (within milliseconds), while MRI is limited by relative
temporal insensitivity. Thus, the combined use of structural or

functional brain imaging (e.g., MRI) with electrophysiological (e.g.,
EEG) techniques enables detection of signals with high temporal
resolution in spatially well characterized regions (Horwitz and
Poeppel, 2002).
Rationales for combining EEG and MRI in a single experimental setting to study stroke include: (1) association of different
physiological phenomena reﬂecting brain activity, i.e., hemodynamic neuronal activation responses (detected with functional
MRI) and electric potentials directly generated by neuronal activity (detected with EEG); (2) correlation of early pathophysiological
responses to reduced CBF, such as hyperacute EEG abnormalities
and DWI signal changes; (3) anatomical localization (from MRI) of
electrophysiological signals (from EEG). In humans, the combination of electrophysiological recording and imaging has successfully
demonstrated that the foci of abnormal EEG delta waves correlate
well with areas of cerebral infarct identiﬁed by CT, PET and MRI
(Nuwer et al., 1987; Murri et al., 1998; Nagata et al., 1989; Finnigan
et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2007).
EEG recording within an MRI scanner allows direct correlation
of stroke-induced EEG abnormalities with structural or functional
MRI changes. However, the recording of EEG within the high magnetic ﬁeld of a MR scanner is associated with signiﬁcant technical
problems (Krakow et al., 2000). Due to methodological progress
in this ﬁeld, technical obstacles can be overcome and simultaneous recordings of neurophysiological and hemodynamic activity
have become increasingly popular in research on epilepsy and cognitive function in humans. In stroke research, combined EEG and
MRI may elucidate the role of distinct EEG oscillation patterns in
relation to underlying structural damage. As an example, simultaneous acquisition of MRI and EEG data has helped to understand
the anatomic-functional basis of asymmetry in frontal intermittent delta activity in stroke patients (Accolla et al., 2011). Until
now, however, there are only a few papers that have reported on
simultaneous use of MRI and EEG in animal models of cerebral
ischemia. Early studies, in which EEG served to directly ascertain
successful MCAO, have demonstrated that early (6–14 min after
MCAO) EEG slowing and ﬂattening coincided with increases of the
DWI signal (Kohno et al., 1995a,b; Hoehn-Berlage et al., 1995).
We speculate that incorporation of EEG recordings into MRI-based
assessment of the diffusion–perfusion mismatch model, could contribute to improved differentiation of the penumbra from oligemia
or the ischemic core. Such evaluation of an EEG–DWI–PWI mismatch may enable identiﬁcation of preserved neuronal synaptic
function within and around the DWI-detected tissue lesion, which
could improve the accuracy of diagnosis, outcome prediction and
treatment selection.
4.2. Combined EEG and fMRI after stroke
In the last years, the combination of fMRI with EEG recordings
has been increasingly used to study the underlying mechanisms of
functional processing in a non-invasive manner combining hemodynamic with neuronal measurements (Shibasaki, 2008). Combining EEG with fMRI in the same experimental setting is an exciting
challenge in neuroscience, still however with limited application in
research on neurological disorders like stroke. Combined EEG-fMRI
approaches could potentially achieve sufﬁcient spatial and temporal resolution to verify effective functional connectivity between
different brain regions. Using this approach in healthy anesthetized
rats, a correlation between resting-state functional connectivity in
bilateral primary somatosensory cortices and power coherence in
slow delta EEG band has been demonstrated (Lu et al., 2007). Simultaneous use of rs-fMRI and EEG in animal stroke models may help
to appropriately assess and interpret disturbances in temporally
correlated signals and phase shifts within widespread neural networks. In a rat MCAO model using a protocol with parallel rs-fMRI

S.G. Moyanova, R.M. Dijkhuizen / Brain Research Bulletin 102 (2014) 22–36

and EEG measurements (performed not simultaneously, but in separate groups of animals) it has been shown that subacutely after
stroke interhemispheric synchronization is signiﬁcantly reduced
for low-frequency BOLD signals as well as low-frequency EEG delta
wave signals, indicative of loss of functional connectivity between
bilaterally homologous regions (van Meer et al., 2012).
An important consideration in the use of EEG and fMRI in animal studies is the effect of anesthesia on the functional output
signals. EEG changes such as replacement of fast alpha and beta
rhythms by slow delta and theta rhythms, occurrence of burst
suppression pattern, or isoelectricity have been reported after
anesthesia (e.g. Otto, 2008). These effects may bias the effects of
stroke induction on the EEG output, as was shown by Zhang et al.
(2006) using chloral hydrate anesthesia. Anesthesia may also affect
neurovascular coupling and as such inﬂuence (rs-)fMRI signals,
and different effects have been observed with different types of
anesthetics (Williams et al., 2010). Nevertheless, several studies
have demonstrated that (rs-)fMRI is feasible in lightly anesthetized
rodents, using medetomidine, ␣-chloralose or isoﬂurane, allowing
robust detection of activation responses and functional connectivity (Masamoto et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011). Further studies with
multimodal approaches (fusion of fMRI and EEG) may aid in further understanding the reorganization of neuronal networks during
the recovery process after stroke. A methodological protocol to
evaluate a number of problems emerging from the particulars of
using rodents in simultaneous fMRI and EEG recording, including a
mini-cap for recording with arrays of electrodes, has recently been
introduced (Sumiyoshi et al., 2011), and subsequently used in rats
under mild hypoxic conditions (Sumiyoshi et al., 2012). We belief
that with advent of new techniques, which will overcome many
technical problems of simultaneous EEG–MRI (Gutberlet, 2010),
there will be a jump in experimental research to characterize the
impact of a stroke-induced lesion on local and remote signaling
and connectivity within and between neuronal networks. This will
expand our understanding of disturbed brain function and recovery mechanisms after stroke in relation to natural history as well
as therapeutic interventions, which could be translated to clinical
stroke units and rehabilitation hospitals.

5. Conclusions
EEG is playing an increasingly important role in clinics for
analyzing brain activities and diagnosing brain diseases including stroke. Despite availability of high-technology instrumentation
(PET, MRI) to unravel the intricacies of cerebral blood ﬂow and
metabolism, EEG provides a valuable and affordable tool in the
evaluation of processes induced by cerebral ischemia, especially
in general laboratory settings. The usefulness and promise of MRI
techniques for routine clinical application are enormous, especially
regarding its potential to predict the clinical course of stroke or
medication efﬁcacy. Although much of the early success in clinical
practice has been based on preclinical investigations, the situation
is nowadays often opposite in the ﬁeld of imaging and electrophysiology: large investments have been made to improve quantitative
EEG and neuroimaging techniques for use in the clinics, but innovative and sophisticated techniques and approaches are not always
available in the preclinical laboratories. Nevertheless, implementation of new multimodal and multiparametric imaging techniques in
preclinical investigations with animal models, would signiﬁcantly
contribute to elucidation of mechanisms underlying brain impairment and recovery, and aid in optimization of diagnostic methods.
Signiﬁcant progress has already been made in multiparametric
MRI to delineate and monitor potentially salvageable ischemic tissue which is at risk of irreversible damage without therapeutic
intervention, which may be exploited in translational studies on

33

promising efﬁcacious medications. Integration of multimodal MRI
and EEG techniques in a single study setting would allow comprehensive characterization of structural and functional tissue status,
which would improve identiﬁcation of salvageable or remodeling
tissue and may provide unique and predictive biomarkers of functional brain tissue status. Furthermore, it can lead to new insights
into intrinsic mechanisms of recovery, which may be exploited for
the development and monitoring of neuroreparative interventions.
