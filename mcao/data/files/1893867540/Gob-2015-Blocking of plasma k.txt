Objective: Recent evidence suggests that ischemic stroke is a thromboinflammatory disease. Plasma kallikrein (PK)
cleaves high–molecular-weight kininogen to release bradykinin (BK) and is a key constituent of the proinflammatory
contact-kinin system. In addition, PK can activate coagulation factor XII, the origin of the intrinsic coagulation cascade. Thus, PK triggers 2 important pathological pathways of stroke formation, thrombosis and inflammation.
Methods: We investigated the consequences of PK inhibition in transient and permanent models of ischemic stroke.
Results: PK-deficient mice of either sex challenged with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion developed significantly smaller brain infarctions and less severe neurological deficits compared with controls without an increase in
infarct-associated hemorrhage. This protective effect was preserved at later stages of infarctions as well as after permanent stroke. Reduced intracerebral thrombosis and improved cerebral blood flow could be identified as underlying mechanisms. Moreover, blood–brain barrier function was maintained in mice lacking PK, and the local
inflammatory response was reduced. PK-deficient mice reconstituted with PK or BK again developed brain infarctions
similar to wild-type mice. Important from a translational perspective, inhibition of PK in wild-type mice using a PKspecific antibody was likewise effective even when performed in a therapeutic setting up to 3 hours poststroke.
Interpretation: PK drives thrombus formation and inflammation via activation of the intrinsic coagulation cascade
and the release of BK but appears to be dispensable for hemostasis. Hence, PK inhibition may offer a safe strategy
to combat thromboembolic disorders including ischemic stroke.

schemic stroke is a devastating disease that strikes >10
million people per year worldwide.1 Although the
underlying pathology is multifactorial, there is increasing
evidence that thrombotic events occurring in the cerebral
microcirculation are of particular relevance for progressive infarct growth both in rodents and in humans.2 We
and others recently showed that blocking of coagulation

factor XII (FXII), the origin of the intrinsic coagulation
cascade, is an effective strategy to improve neuronal survival in the ischemic brain by counteracting intracerebral
thrombosis.3–5 Importantly, genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of FXII did not increase the risk of
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most serious complication of current antithrombotic therapies.6

Apart from thrombosis, inflammation is another
key mediator of ischemic brain damage.7,8 Lack of oxygen and nutrients during an ischemic insult causes the
release of danger signals from dying neuronal tissues and
rapid activation of the cerebral endothelium including
the upregulation of different cellular adhesion molecules.
As a consequence, inflammatory cells such as neutrophils,
macrophages, or T cells can adhere to and transmigrate
across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to enter the brain
parenchyma. Those cells together with resident brain
cells (endothelial cell, neurons, glial cells) perpetuate the
local inflammatory response by producing a plethora of
soluble immune mediators (e.g. cytokines, degrading
enzymes) and chemoattractants. If sterile inflammation
persists, the BBB becomes disintegrated, which on a
structural level is reflected by the degradation of tight
junction proteins and finally, the formation of vascular
edema.8 Excessive edema can damage otherwise healthy
brain tissue by herniation and is a frequent cause of
delayed functional deterioration in patients who have
experienced a stroke.
We recently introduced the novel pathophysiological concept of thromboinflammation in ischemic stroke.9
This term describes a tightly regulated interplay between
thrombotic (e.g. platelets, coagulation factors) and
inflammatory (e.g. immune cells) mechanisms taking
place at the neurovascular unit. Of note, targeted inhibition of thromboinflammation appears to be a promising
approach to treat or prevent acute ischemic stroke.7
Plasma kallikrein (PK) is a multifunctional serine
protease that, together with FXII, FXI, and high–
molecular-weight kininogen (KNG), builds the plasma
contact-kinin system.10 Activation of PK by FXII cleaves
KNG to release the proinflammatory peptide hormone
bradykinin (BK). At the same time, PK can convert FXII
to its active form (FXIIa) leading to autoactivation of the
contact-kinin system and thrombus formation via the
intrinsic pathway.11 Because of this dual mode of action
(proinflammatory and prothrombotic), the contact-kinin
system represents a promising target for potential stroke
therapies. Blocking of distinct members of the contactkinin system reduced vascular leakage, inflammation, and
thrombosis in different models of acute ischemic
stroke.3,12,13 However, to what extent the different molecular constituents of the contact-kinin system contribute to
stroke development has been largely unknown, as has the
most appropriate target in terms of efficacy and safety.
To address this issue, we analyzed neurological outcome, thrombus formation, and inflammatory processes
in PK-deficient mice and wild-type (WT) mice treated
with a pharmacological PK inhibitor in models of focal
cerebral ischemia.

Materials and Methods
Animals
All animal experiments were approved by local state authorities
(Regierung von Unterfranken) and conducted in agreement
with the German Animal Welfare Act (German Ministry of
Agriculture, Health, and Economic Cooperation). PK-deficient
(Pk2/2) mice were provided by Deltagen (San Mateo, CA).
WT littermates (Pk1/1 mice) served as controls. Pharmacological inhibition of PK by a PK-specific antibody was performed
in C57BL/6 mice purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). A total of 440 mice (148 Pk1/1, 203 Pk2/2, and 89
C57BL/6 mice) were included in the study.

Generation of PK-Deficient Mice
Pk2/2 mice were generated by Deltagen using a replacement vector
to selectively replace a nucleotide sequence within exon 9 of the
murine Klkb1 gene (accession number: M58588). The targeting vector for homologous recombination was designed by flanking a LacZNeo cassette with a 2.5kb genomic fragment upstream of Klkb1
exon 9 and a 3.0kb genomic fragment downstream of Klkb1 exon 9.
Pk2/2 mice were healthy and bred normally, when housed under
pathogen-free conditions. Pk1/1 littermates served as controls for all
experiments. To assess efficient disruption of the Klkb1 gene and to
verify that neither PK nor any truncated product of PK is present
in Pk2/2 mice, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) and Western blot analysis was performed. PCR analysis
using reversely transcribed mRNA from liver tissue as a template
was conducted to amplify a PK-specific 393 base pair transcript
with oligonucleotides 50 -GAACTGAATGTGACCTTCGTGCAA30 (forward) and 50 -AAGCAATGGGCAGCTGTCAGTAC-30
(reverse). For Western blot analysis, PK was detected in liver tissue
using a PK-specific antibody (Ab1006; Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
Both PK mRNA and protein were absent in samples derived from
Pk2/2 mice.

Stroke Model
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient (60 minutes)
or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in 6to 8-week-old male and female mice as described.13,14 Mice
were anesthetized with 2.0% isoflurane, and core body temperature was maintained at 37 C throughout surgery. Following a
midline skin incision in the neck, the proximal common
carotid artery and the external carotid artery were ligated and a
standardized silicon rubber-coated nylon monofilament
(6023910PK10; Doccol, Sharon, MA) was inserted and
advanced via the right internal carotid artery to occlude the origin of the right middle cerebral artery. For transient MCAO
(tMCAO), the intraluminal suture was left in situ for 60
minutes. After that mice were reanesthetized and the occluding
monofilament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. For permanent ischemia (pMCAO), the occluding filament was left in
situ until the animals were sacrificed. Operation time per animal did not exceed 10 minutes. For reconstitution experiments,
subgroups of PK-deficient mice were injected intravenously
with affinity-purified human PK (hPKa 1303; Enzyme Research
Laboratories, South Bend, IN)15 at a dosage of 80lg/animal16

immediately before the induction of MCAO. To reconstitute
BK levels in the central nervous system, PK-deficient mice
received an intrathecal injection17 of BK (100ng/animal dissolved in 5ll of phosphate-buffered saline; Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO) immediately after the induction of tMCAO and
again at the time of reperfusion.13 For pharmacological inhibition of PK, 6- to 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice or Pk2/2
mice were randomly selected to receive either 10lg of a PKspecific antibody (a-PK, Ab1006, Abcam)15 or control immunoglobulin G (IgG; sc-2025; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas,
TX) intravenously 1 hour or 3 hours after the beginning of
ischemia. Edema corrected infarct volumes were calculated by
planimetric measurements (ImageJ software; National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MA) as described.18

using the Bradykinin EIA Kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA) as described.20

Determination of Serum Estrogen Levels
The estrus cycle of female Pk1/1 mice and female Pk2/2 mice
was synchronized according to Whitten.21 Briefly, a colony of
40-day-old female mice (Pk1/1 and Pk2/2) was grouped and
housed in the presence of an adult male mouse. To determine
the respective estrus cycle phases for each mouse, vaginal smear
cytology was performed as described.22 For the evaluation of
estrogen levels, serum samples from anestrus mice, that is, during
the long-lasting nonreproductive phase, were collected. Estradiol
E2 serum concentrations (pg/ml) were assessed by enzyme-linked
immunoassay using the Estradiol (E2) ELISA Kit (Calbiotech,
Spring Valley, CA)23,24 and calculated from standard curves.

Stroke Study Population and Quality Control
All stroke experiments were conducted according to the recommendations for research in experimental stroke studies19 and
the current ARRIVE guidelines (http://www.nc3rs.org/
ARRIVE). Animals were randomly assigned to the operators by
independent persons not involved in data acquisition and analysis. Surgeries and evaluation of all readout parameters were performed blinded to the experimental groups.
The following conditions excluded mice from endpoint analyses (exclusion criteria): (1) death within 24 hours after MCAO
(except for survival studies), (2) subarachnoidal hemorrhage or
bleeding into the brain parenchyma (as macroscopically assessed
during brain sampling or by magnetic resonance imaging), (3)
Bederson score 5 0 (24 hours after MCAO), and (4) operation
time > 10 minutes. In total, 440 mice were used in this study. Of
the 348 mice subjected to tMCAO, 39 mice (11,2%) met at least
1 exclusion criterion after randomization and therefore were withdrawn from the study. The number of excluded animals (dropout
rate) was evenly distributed between the groups (p > 0.05).

Assessment of Functional Outcome
Global neurological deficits were quantified according to the Bederson score. The grip test score was applied to monitor motor function
and coordination. Neurological outcome over time and mortality
rates were assessed on a daily basis until day 7 after stroke.17

Laser Doppler Flowmetry
Laser Doppler flowmetry (Moore Instruments, Devon, UK) was
performed at baseline (before ischemia), immediately after
inserting the occluding filament (ischemia), immediately after
removing the occluding filament (reperfusion), and again 4
hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours after tMCAO as previously
described.13 The procedure was performed in separate groups
of animals, that is, groups that were not included in the final
endpoint analysis (infarct volumes, functional outcome tests).
Animals were repeatedly anesthetized for serial cerebral blood
flow (CBF) measurements at the time points indicated above.

Coagulation Analysis
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was determined
by standard methods using the BCS XP System (Siemens
Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany).3

Counting of Platelets
Fifty microliters of blood was drawn from the retro-orbital
plexus of anesthetized mice by siliconized microcapillaries and
collected in a 1.5ml tube containing 300ll of heparin in Trisbuffered saline (20U/ml, pH 7.3). We determined platelet
counts and size using a Sysmex KX-21N automated hematology
analyzer (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany).

Bleeding Analysis
Determination of tail bleeding time was performed as previously described.25

Determination of Complement Activation
For the detection of C5a in the serum and brain, a rat antimouse C5a capture antibody (clone I52-1486; BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA) and a rat anti-mouse C5a biotin-labeled
detection antibody (clone I52-278, BD Pharmingen) were
used. Enzyme-linked immunoassay for C5a was performed
according to standard protocols.26 Levels of serum C5a were
calculated from the standard curve run for each experiment
and expressed as ng/ml.

Blood Gas Analysis
One hundred microliters of arterial blood was drawn from the
left cardiac ventricle of anesthetized mice by a heparinized
syringe. We determined PaO2, PaCO2, and pH using an ABL 77
automated blood gas analyzer (Radiometer, Brønshøj, Denmark).

Invasive Hemodynamics
Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed as described
previously.27

and mAb anti–b-actin (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich).

Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed according to
standard procedures.12 For specific staining, the following antibodies
were used: pAb anti-CD31 (ab9498, Abcam), mAb anti-GPXI
(clone 5678, Emfret Analytics), pAb anti-occludin (ab31721,
Abcam), mAb anti–Ly-6B.2 alloantigen (MCA771GA; AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK), and mAb anti-CD11b (MCA711, AbD Serotec).
For quantification of immune cells, identical brain sections from the
cortices and the basal ganglia were selected and cell counting was performed as described.28 For calculation of the thrombosis index, the
number of patent and occluded blood vessels was counted from
hematoxylin and eosin–stained brain slices as described.28 All sections
were analyzed and acquired with a Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope
equipped with the DS-U3 DS camera control unit and NISElements software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Digital images were processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA).

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed according to
standard procedures.12 Relative gene expression levels of interleukin 1b (Il-1b; assay ID: Mm 00434228_m1; Applied Biosystems,
Frankfurt, Germany), tumor necrosis factor a (Tnfa; assay ID:
Mm 00443258_m1, Applied Biosystems), and transforming
growth factor ß1 (Tgf-ß 1; assay ID: Mm 00441724_m1, Applied
Biosystems) were quantified with fluorescent TaqMan technology.
Gapdh (TaqMan Predeveloped Assay Reagents for gene expression, part number: 4352339E, Applied Biosystems) was used as
an endogenous control. PCR was performed with equal amounts
of cDNA and water control in the StepOnePlusTM Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the TaqMan Universal
23 PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Each sample was
measured in triplicate, and data points were examined for integrity by analysis of the amplification plot.

Statistics
All results were expressed as mean 6 standard error of the mean
except for ordinal functional outcome scales, which were depicted
as scatter plots including median with the 25% percentile and
the 75% percentile given in brackets in the text. Numbers of animals (n 5 10) necessary to detect a standardized effect size on
infarct volumes  0.25 (Pk1/1 vs Pk2/2 mice) were determined
via a priori sample size calculation with the following assumptions: a 5 0.05, b5 0.2 (power 80%), mean 20% standard
deviation of the mean (GraphPad Stat Mate 2.0; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). For statistical analysis, the GraphPad
Prism 5 software package was used. Data were tested for Gaussian distribution with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov normality test
and then analyzed by 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or in
the case of measuring the effects of 2 factors simultaneously by
2-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni adjustment for p values. Nonparametric functional outcome scores were compared by
Kruskal–Wallis test with post hoc Dunn corrections. If only 2
groups were compared, unpaired, 2-tailed Student t test was

Results
Ischemic Stroke Activates the Contact-Kinin
System
First we investigated the presence of active PK and its
inactive precursor prekallikrein in the ischemic brains
from WT mice with induced focal cerebral ischemia over
time or sham-operated controls by immunoblot analysis
(Fig 1A). Here, we chose tMCAO to provoke focal cerebral ischemia in mice. tMCAO has been shown to trigger
a rapid and strong activation of the contact-kinin system,
leading to sterile inflammation and progressive microvascular thrombosis within the brain.13,29 Prekallikrein and
active PK were only weakly detectable in the brains of
sham-operated mice or in the ipsilesional and contralesional cortex and basal ganglia 6 hours poststroke. After
12 hours, however, the presence of prekallikrein and PK
in both ipsilesional brain areas started to increase and
was highest after 24 hours. The rise in PK levels was paralleled by an increase in plasma BK (p < 0.05, see Fig
1B, Table 1) and is in accordance with our previous
observation of an enhanced cleavage of KNG by PK after
tMCAO in mice.13
Plasma Kallikrein Deficiency Provides Sustained
Protection from Ischemic Stroke
To evaluate the functional role of PK in acute ischemic
stroke, we generated PK-deficient mice (Pk2/2) by targeted disruption of exon 9 of the murine Klkb1 gene
(accession number: M58588; Fig 2). In a first set of
experiments, we subjected 6- to 8-week-old male mice to
tMCAO and, after 24 hours, assessed infarct volumes by
staining brain sections with triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC). Infarct volumes were significantly smaller, by
>50%, in male Pk2/2 mice than in male littermates
788

(105.3 6 5.6mm3 for Pk1/1 vs 49.9 6 6.7mm3 for
Pk2/2, p < 0.001, mortality 13% for Pk1/1 vs 7% for
Pk2/2, Fig 3A). Importantly, the smaller infarct volumes
also translated into a better functional outcome. Compared with Pk1/1 mice, Pk2/2 mice showed significantly
improved overall neurologic function (Bederson score:
median, 3.0 [3.0, 4.0] for Pk1/1 vs 2.0 [2.0, 3.0] for Pk2/2,
p < 0.01) as well as motor function and coordination (grip
test score: median, 2.0 [0.0, 3.0] for Pk1/1 vs 3.0 [3.0, 4.0]
for Pk2/2, p < 0.01, see Fig 3B).
To test whether the protective effect was specifically
related to PK deficiency, we reconstituted male Pk2/2
mice with human PK (hPK).15 Intravenous infusion of
80lg hPK/mouse16 immediately before stroke induction
restored the susceptibility of Pk2/2 mice toward ischemic
brain damage, as infarct size (p > 0.05, mortality: 10%,
see Fig 3A) and neurologic outcome measures (p > 0.05,
see Fig 3B) were indistinguishable from Pk1/1 mice.
Accordingly, Pk2/2 mice reconstituted with hPK again
had active PK in their brains after tMCAO and, similar
to Pk1/1 mice, were able to cleave native KNG (Fig 4A,
B, Table 1).
In Pk2/2 mice, KNG cannot be cleaved by the
active enzyme PK to release BK. Consequently, the Pk2/
2
mice used in this study displayed markedly lower BK
levels in the plasma compared with WT mice (see Table
1), which is in line with the results from another PKdeficient mouse line.30 To clarify whether less BK formation is a major determinant of the stroke-protective phenotype observed in PK-deficient mice, we reconstituted
Pk2/2 mice with purified BK. Because BK has a short
half-life in the blood and to obtain maximum BK concentrations directly within the central nervous system, we
decided to inject BK intrathecally immediately after the
induction of tMCAO and again at the time of reperfusion (100ng per injection).13 Reconstitution of Pk2/2

mice, PK-deficient female mice likewise developed significantly smaller infarctions (p < 0.001, mortality: 19%

respective female controls, although neurological tests
only showed a nonsignificant trend toward improved
function in female Pk2/2 mice (p > 0.05, see Fig 3B).

There is evidence that the gonadal hormone estrogen can act neuroprotectively in ischemic stroke.32,33 To
exclude that improved stroke outcome in female Pk2/2
mice compared with female Pk1/1 mice was due to differences in estrogen levels rather than absence of PK, we
determined the concentration of serum estradiol E2

Volume 77, No. 5

G€
ob et al: Plasma Kallikrein and Stroke

(Table 2). We did not find significant differences in the
basal estradiol E2 serum concentrations between female
Pk1/1 and female Pk2/2 mice (p > 0.05).
Current experimental stroke guidelines recommend
evaluation of any protective effect in models of both
transient and permanent ischemia.19 We therefore subjected Pk2/2 mice to filament-induced pMCAO, a procedure in which tissue reperfusion is absent. Although
the reduction in stroke size was less pronounced compared with tMCAO, stroke volumes in Pk2/2 mice were
significantly smaller on day 1 also after pMCAO (p <
0.001, mortality: 42% for Pk1/1 vs 28% for Pk2/2, see
Fig 3A). Moreover, Pk2/2 mice tended to develop less
severe neurological deficits after pMCAO, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05, see
Fig 3B).
To exclude the possibility that PK deficiency simply
induces faster recovery from stroke, we also determined
the functional outcome and mortality of 6- to 8-weekold male Pk2/2 mice and control littermates over a longer period after ischemic stroke. Four days after 60
minutes of tMCAO, 8 of 14 (57.1% mortality) control
mice had died, and only 3 of the 14 (78.6% mortality)
survived until day 7, consistent with previous reports
(Fig 5A).12,13,17 In contrast, 10 of 13 (23.1% mortality)
Pk2/2 mice survived until day 4, and 8 of 13 (38.5%
mortality) Pk2/2 mice were still alive after 7 days (p 5
0.037). In line with these findings, PK-deficient mice
had a significantly better Bederson score than Pk1/1
mice over the whole observation period after tMCAO
(p < 0.05 at days 1, 6, and 7, p < 0.01 at day 5, see
Fig 5B).
PK Deficiency Reduces Intracerebral Thrombosis
after Stroke without Increasing the Risk of Brain
Hemorrhage
PK can activate FXII, the origin of the intrinsic coagulation cascade, and PK deficiency has been shown to
ameliorate thrombus formation in models of vessel wall
injury.11,34 We therefore analyzed whether reduced
intracerebral clot formation is also a major underlying
cause of the stroke-protective phenotype in Pk2/2 mice
(Fig 6). Western blot analysis using an antibody against
the platelet marker GpIbb revealed significantly less
thrombus formation in the ischemic cortices (GpIbb
immunoreactivity: p < 0.01) and basal ganglia (GpIbb
immunoreactivity: p < 0.05) of PK-deficient mice than
in those of littermate controls 24 hours after tMCAO.
Accordingly, immunohistochemistry and histology of
infarcted brain tissue from control mice detected
numerous thrombi within the vessel lumina. In comparison, the microvascular patency was significantly

of an antibody against high–molecular-weight kininogen
(KNG). Immunoreactivity against native KNG was downregulated in the ischemic brains of Pk1/1 mice and Pk2/2
mice reconstituted with hPK but was preserved in Pk2/2
mice. Accordingly, cleaved KNG, which is produced when
native KNG is proteolyzed by PK to generate bradykinin,
was only weakly detectable in the ischemic tissues of PKdeficient mice. In contrast, Pk1/1 mice and Pk2/2 mice
reconstituted with hPK showed high protein levels of
cleaved KNG within their ischemic brains. (B) Immunoblots

increased in mice lacking PK (thrombosis index:
p < 0.05). The observation that less thrombi were
formed also in the basal ganglia of Pk2/2 mice, a brain
region that regularly became ischemic in both mouse
groups, that is, Pk2/2 and Pk1/1 mice (see Fig 3A),
suggests that smaller infarct volumes in the absence of
PK are due to reduced intracerebral thrombosis rather
than vice versa. The hypothesis that protection from
stroke in the absence of PK is causally linked to reduced
thrombus formation was further strengthened by the
observation that reconstitution of Pk2/2 mice with hPK
prior to tMCAO fully restored the thrombotic activity
in the ischemic brains (see Fig 6A, C).
To further address whether reduced thrombus formation in the absence of PK also leads to better brain
(re)perfusion, we determined the CBF over time in the
territory of the right middle cerebral artery by Laser
Doppler flowmetry (see Fig 6D). No differences in baseline CBF (before ischemia), CBF after insertion of the
occluding filament (percentage of baseline immediately
after ischemia: 29% for Pk1/1 vs 23% for Pk2/2 vs
28% for Pk2/2 [1hPK], p > 0.05), or CBF after
removal of the occluding filament (percentage of baseline immediately after reperfusion: 52% for Pk1/1 vs
54% for Pk2/2 vs 59% for Pk2/2 [1hPK], p > 0.05;
percentage of baseline 4 hours after reperfusion: 65%
for Pk1/1 vs 71% for Pk2/2 vs 64% for Pk2/2
[1hPK], p > 0.05) were observed between Pk1/1 mice,
Pk2/2 mice, and Pk2/2 mice that had been reconstituted with hPK, indicating comparable procedural conditions in all groups. Twelve hours (percentage of
baseline: 70% for Pk1/1 vs 84% for Pk2/2 vs 74% for
Pk2/2 [1hPK], p < 0.05) and 24 hours (percentage of
baseline: 59% for Pk1/1 vs 87% for Pk2/2 vs 63% for
Pk2/2 [1hPK], p < 0.001) after reperfusion, however,
CBF in the brains of PK-deficient mice was significantly
higher compared with Pk1/1 mice and Pk2/2 mice
reconstituted with hPK.
Induction of bleeding complications is considered
the most relevant adverse effect of current antithrombotic
treatments.2 Therefore, we analyzed the consequences of
PK deficiency on the dynamics of infarct development
and the risk of intracranial hemorrhage by serial MRI on
792

living mice (Fig 7A). In Pk2/2 mice, areas of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images typical of acute cerebral
infarction were significantly smaller than in control mice
24 hours after tMCAO (p < 0.05, see Fig 7B), conforming assessments with TTC staining (see Fig 3A). The size
of infarctions assessed in individual Pk2/2 mice by
sequential MRI remained significantly smaller than in
the controls on day 7 (p < 0.05) and infarctions did not
increase after 1 week, thus excluding delayed infarct
growth (p > 0.05). Importantly, MRI showed that ischemic lesions in Pk2/2 mice always presented as hyperintense
lesions on T2-weighted gradient-echo images, a MRI protocol for the detection of bleeding (see Fig 7A).

Hypointense areas, which typically indicate hemorrhage,
were absent in all animals, supporting the notion that PK
deficiency does not increase the risk of reperfusionassociated bleeding compared with control mice, even at
more advanced stages of infarct development. This was further underlined by the finding that tail bleeding times and

basal platelet analysis (e.g. platelet size and count) did not
differ between Pk2/2 mice and littermate controls (Table
3). Pk2/2 mice only showed a spontaneously elevated
aPTT (see Table 3), thereby confirming previous reports of
an elevated aPTT after genetic modification of the contactkinin system.3,15,34

PK Deficiency Reduces BBB Damage and
Inflammation after Stroke
The contact-kinin system is also a key mediator of tissue
inflammation and vascular permeability after ischemic
stroke.7 One central step in this process is the release of
the proinflammatory peptide hormone BK from KNG
after PK activation. Consequently, the extent of damage
to the BBB and formation of edema was assessed after
focal cerebral ischemia. On day 1 after tMCAO, the
integrity of the BBB, as reflected by the concentration of
the vascular tracer Evans blue leaking into the brain
parenchyma, was significantly preserved in Pk2/2 mice
in comparison with control mice (Evans blue concentration: 1.2 6 0.2lg for Pk1/1 vs 0.6 6 0.1lg for Pk2/2,
p < 0.05, Fig 8A). Similar to intracerebral thrombus formation (see Fig 6), reduced BBB disruption could be
found in both the cortices and the basal ganglia of Pk2/
2
mice, indicating that this was a specific phenomenon
and mechanistically relevant but not simply because of
smaller infarct volumes. In addition, Evans blue extravasation in Pk2/2 mice that had received hPK prior to the
induction of stroke was similar to that in Pk1/1 mice
(1.2 6 0.2lg for Pk1/1 vs 1.1 6 0.2lg Pk2/2 [1hPK],
p > 0.05).
In accordance with a destabilizing effect of PK at
the BBB, significant degradation of the tight junction
protein occludin was observed by Western blot in the
ischemic brains of Pk1/1 mice on day 1 after tMCAO
compared with sham-operated mice. In contrast, occludin degradation was less pronounced in the ischemic
brains of Pk2/2 mice (occludin immunoreactivity in
cortex: p < 0.001, occludin immunoreactivity in basal
ganglia: p < 0.05 for Pk1/1 vs Pk2/2, see Fig 8B) but
could be completely recovered in Pk2/2 mice that had
been reconstituted with hPK (cortex, basal ganglia: p >
0.05 for Pk1/1 vs Pk2/2 [1hPK]). Immunohistochemistry confirmed preserved occludin expression at the cer-

ebral tight junctions in Pk2/2 mice on day 1 after
tMCAO (see Fig 8C).
To assess whether maintenance of the BBB in
Pk2/2 mice after stroke also has an effect on the invasion of inflammatory cells,8 we quantified the amount
of neutrophils and macrophages/microglia in the brain
by immunocytochemistry (Fig 9A, B). On day 1 after
tMCAO, significantly more CD11b1 macrophages/
microglia cells (total number of CD11b1 cells/slice:
801 6 41 for Pk1/1 vs 265 6 20 for Pk2/2, p <
0.001, n 5 5) and neutrophils (total number of Ly6B.21 cells/slice: 56 6 10 for Pk1/1 vs 30 6 4 for
Pk2/2, p < 0.05, n 5 5) were present in the brains of
control mice than the brains of Pk2/2 mice. Quantification of absolute immune cell numbers from histological
slices from the entire brain can induce bias because of
smaller infarctions in Pk2/2 mice. Therefore, we also
calculated the density (cells/mm2)28 of macrophages/
microglia and neutrophils in the ischemic cortices and
basal ganglia of Pk2/2 mice and Pk1/1 mice on day 1
after tMCAO (see Fig 9A, B). Higher densities of
CD11b1 macrophages/microglia (cortex: p < 0.05,
basal ganglia: p > 0.05) and Ly-6B.21 neutrophils (cortex: p > 0.05, basal ganglia: p < 0.05) were found in
the cortices and basal ganglia of Pk1/1 mice in comparison with Pk2/2 mice. Again, the density of immune
cells in the cortices and basal ganglia of Pk2/2 mice
reconstituted with hPK was similar to the density in the
brains of Pk1/1 mice (p > 0.05).
Next we analyzed the gene expression profiles of
several
prototypic
proinflammatory
and
antiinflammatory cytokines in the brains of Pk1/1 mice,
Pk2/2 mice, and Pk2/2 mice reconstituted with hPK
24 hours after tMCAO (see Fig 9C). The amount of
Il-1b mRNA in the infarcted cortices and basal ganglia
was strongly elevated in all groups compared with the
sham-operated group (p < 0.05). Induction of Il-1b

mRNA, however, was significantly lower in the cortices
and basal ganglia of mice that were devoid of PK than
in control littermates (p < 0.05 for Pk1/1 vs Pk2/2).
Again, injection of hPK into Pk2/2 mice prior to
tMCAO normalized the expression of Il-1b in the
ischemic brain (p > 0.05 for Pk1/1 vs Pk2/2 [1hPK]).
In contrast, Tnf-a transcripts did not differ between the
tMCAO groups in either brain region (p > 0.05), indicating selective regulation of distinct cytokines by PK.
Finally, the mRNA expression of Tgf-b1, which can
exert anti-inflammatory functions in ischemic stroke,
was higher in the cortices and basal ganglia of Pk2/2
mice in comparison to Pk1/1 mice and Pk2/2 mice
reconstituted with hPK (cortex: p > 0.05 for Pk1/1 vs
Pk2/2 and Pk2/2 mice [1hPK], p < 0.05 for Pk2/2
vs Pk2/2 [1hPK]; basal ganglia: p < 0.01 for Pk1/1 vs
Pk2/2, p < 0.05 for Pk2/2 vs Pk2/2 [1hPK], p >
0.05 for Pk1/1 vs Pk2/2 [1hPK]).
PK is also able to initiate the alternative complement pathway,10 and alterations of the complement cascade can have a strong impact on stroke outcome in
May 2015

different animal species.35 Therefore, we also checked for
C5a levels in the serum and brains of naive and stroked
Pk1/1 and Pk2/2 littermates (see Table 3). No significant differences in C5a levels were observed between the
groups (p > 0.05), indicating that activation of the alternative complement pathway in Pk2/2 mice occurs via
different, that is, redundant mechanisms.
Pharmacological Inhibition of PK Effectively
Protects from Ischemic Brain Damage in a
Clinically Relevant Setting
Finally, we wanted to examine whether the genetic
insights into the pathophysiological role of PK in ischemic stroke can be translated into a therapeutic intervention. Therefore, we examined the efficacy of a
neutralizing PK-specific antibody (a-PK), which has been
shown to effectively block PK activity in a mouse model
of cerebral hemorrhage.15 Application of a-PK (10lg) 1
hour after the induction of tMCAO significantly reduced
infarct volumes (89.6 6 6.4mm3 for the control group
vs 51.1 6 2.8mm3 for the a-PK–treated group, p <

0.001, mortality: 17% for the control group vs 0% for
the a-PK–treated group, Fig 10A) and improved functional outcome (Bederson score: median, 3.0 [2.0, 3.0]
for the control group vs 2.0 [1.0, 3.0] for the a-PK–
treated group, p > 0.05, grip test score: median, 3.0
[2.75, 4.0] for the control group vs 4.0 [4.0, 5.0] for the
a-PK–treated group, p <0.01, see Fig 10B) compared
with control mice on day 1 after tMCAO.
We also determined the functional outcome and
mortality of a-PK–treated mice and isotype-treated controls over a longer time period after ischemic stroke.
Seven days after 60 minutes of tMCAO, 9 of 13 control
796

mice (69.2% mortality) had died. In contrast, 9 of the
13 mice treated with a-PK survived until day 7 (30.7%
mortality; p 5 0.048, see Fig 10C). In line with these
findings, a-PK–treated mice showed significantly better
Bederson scores and grip test scores than controls over
the whole observation period until day 7 after tMCAO
(see Fig 10D).
Importantly, the a-PK antibody was unable to further improve stroke outcome in Pk2/2 mice (p > 0.05,
mortality: 0%), which virtually excludes unspecific antibody effects (see Fig 10A, B). Accordingly, a-PK treatment in WT mice blocked the physiological conversion
of native KNG into cleaved KNG following stroke (see
Fig 4C).
We also assessed the efficacy of the PK-specific antibody in an extended time window, that is, 3 hours after the
induction of tMCAO (see Fig 10A, B). Application of a-PK
in this delayed setting was still able to reduce infarct volumes (90.1 6 4.6mm3 for the control group vs 68.0 6
7.1mm3 for the a-PK–treated group, p < 0.05, mortality:
9% for the control group vs 18% for the a-PK–treated
group) and to improve neurological outcome (Bederson
score: median, 3.0 [2.0, 3.25] for the control group vs 3.0
[1.0, 3.0] for the a-PK–treated group, p > 0.05, grip test
score: median, 2.5 [2.0, 3.0] for the control group vs 4.0
[2.75, 4.0] for the a-PK–treated group, p <0.05) on day 1
after tMCAO, although to a lesser extent compared with
the 1-hour time window.
In line with the results obtained in Pk2/2 mice, aPK treatment in WT mice reduced intracerebral thrombus formation (GpIbb immunoreactivity in cortex: p >
0.05, GpIbb immunoreactivity in basal ganglia: p <
0.001 for the control group vs the a-PK–treated group,
see Fig 10E) and BBB disruption (occludin immunoreactivity in cortex: p < 0.01, occludin immunoreactivity in
basal ganglia: p > 0.05 for the control group vs the aPK–treated group, see Fig 10F) on day 1 after tMCAO.

Discussion
We here demonstrate that PK acts detrimentally in stroke
by triggering microvascular thrombosis and inflammation. Genetic depletion of PK induced strong protection
from brain ischemia–reperfusion injury in male and
female mice. The effect was long-lasting and preserved
after permanent ischemia. Important from a clinical perspective, pharmacological inhibition of PK was likewise
effective even when performed in a therapeutic setting.
Although PK inhibition caused a significant reduction in
inflammation and thrombus formation after MCAO, the
intracerebral bleeding risk was not increased.
Our findings in Pk2/2 mice strongly support the
hypothesis that the contact-kinin system is critically

involved in the pathophysiology of ischemic brain damage29,36 and are in good accordance with previous investigations addressing the role of other members of the
contact-kinin system in stroke.3,13 For example, depletion
of KNG, the main substrate of PK, improved outcome
after tMCAO in mice and this could be ascribed to less
thromboinflammation.13 As a major limitation, however,
there are currently no specific inhibitors of KNG available that would allow for further clinical testing. FXII,
the primary activator of both the intrinsic coagulation
and the kallikrein–kinin system, is another attractive target for treating thromboembolism.3–5 In vivo binding of
FXII to negatively charged molecules leads to the assembly of an activation complex comprising FXII, PK, and
high–molecular-weight KNG.10 F122/2 mice, like PKdeficient mice, generate less thrombi in different models
of thrombosis, including ischemic stroke, but do not
have an increased bleeding tendency either spontaneously
or when subjected to brain ischemia.3 Successful prevention of excessive clotting without interfering with physiological hemostasis would represent a “magic bullet” in
the therapy of many thromboembolic disorders, given
that the current drugs used to prevent thromboembolism
are all associated with bleeding complications.2
The observation of an antithrombotic effect of PK
deficiency in an in vivo model of ischemic stroke, which
was fully reversible after reconstitution of Pk2/2 mice
with exogenous PK, is congruent with the findings after
artificial vessel wall injury. Pk2/2 mice were completely
protected from vessel occlusion in FeCl3-induced arterial
or venous thrombosis.34 Similar results were obtained
when PK expression was reduced in a knockdown

approach.11 Hematologic characterization of our Pk2/2
mice revealed an increased aPTT but normal tail bleeding times, which is in line with a previous report15 and
indicative for an antithrombotic but not antihemostatic
phenotype in these animals. The risk of stroke-related
hemorrhage was not increased in mice lacking PK in our
study. Of the 154 Pk2/2 mice subjected to MCAO, only
8 (5.2%) showed signs of intracerebral bleeding, which
was similar to the bleeding rate in Pk1/1 mice (6 of 108
5 5.6%, p > 0.05) and which is within the range of
expected bleeding frequency in this stroke model.37 In
line with this finding, intraparenchymal bleeding rates in
WT mice treated with the a-PK antibody did not differ
from those observed in WT mice treated with control
IgG (1 of 39 5 2.6% vs 2 of 47 5 4.3%, p > 0.05). In
comparison, full-intensity anticoagulation of stroked
rodents with heparin or warfarin induced intracranial
hemorrhages in >50% of the cases.38 These numbers
underpin that blocking of PK in ischemic stroke is presumably a safer approach than established treatment
regimens.
Reduction of FXII activation probably represents a
key mechanism through which PK deficiency prevents
thrombus formation in vivo.11 Other mechanisms might
include reduced generation of functional thrombin in the
absence of PK.39 Moreover, PK is able to directly activate
protease-activated receptor-140 and to regulate plasma
levels of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor.41 Interestingly, a recent study reported that PK mediates hematoma expansion in a mouse model of ICH,15
which at first glance contrasts our findings of a prothrombotic effect of PK in ischemic stroke. However, in

this model PK showed antithrombotic properties only
under conditions of hyperglycemia (diabetic mice) but
not normoglycemia. Hyperglycemia was essential to cause
PK-mediated inhibition of collagen-induced platelet
aggregation. Nevertheless, these findings have to be carefully taken into account if one aims to block PK in
ischemic stroke in the clinical setting, because patients
presenting with ischemic stroke are often diabetic or
show elevated glucose levels42 and bleeding into the
infarcted brain area frequently occurs.43,44
Interestingly, Pk2/2 mice were protected from
stroke also after pMCAO. This differs from our previous
findings in Kng2/213 and F122/23 mice and indicates
that PK acts detrimentally not exclusively during the
phase of reperfusion, which is characterized by activation
of the endothelium, progressive microvascular thrombosis, and excessive inflammation,9 but also during persisting ischemia. Although the mechanisms through which
PK deficiency increases the resistance against permanent
ischemia in the brain still need to be established, the
finding is of potential clinical relevance given that <50%
of all stroke patients presenting with an occlusion of a
large brain vessel show spontaneous recanalization.45,46
Intracerebral PK levels after tMCAO in WT mice
increased with time, whereas Pk2/2 mice were no longer
able to cleave native KNG. Accordingly, plasma BK levels
were strongly decreased in Pk2/2 mice. Notably, reconstitution of Pk2/2 mice with hPK fully restored the
capacity to cleave KNG and to normalize plasma BK levels. PK activation following stroke is in full accordance
with previous studies showing activation of the contactkinin system upon stroke both under experimental conditions13 and in humans.29 Interestingly, high levels of PK
were associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke
in young women taking oral contraceptives.36 However,
little is known about the functional relevance of PK deficiency for thrombus formation in humans (Fletcher
trait), because cases are generally rare. These individuals
do not suffer from bleeding diathesis and only show a
prolonged aPTT.10
The main function of PK is to release the proinflammatory peptide hormone BK from KNG, and mice
deficient in PK produce significantly less BK than controls, as demonstrated here as well as in a previous
study.34 This lack of BK most probably underlies the
strong anti-inflammatory phenotype observed in brain
ischemia and maybe also other disease models.47 The
BBB was stabilized in the absence of PK after tMCAO,
an effect that could be ascribed to the maintenance of
tight junction proteins. As a consequence, mice without
PK developed significantly less brain edema, whereas
Pk2/2 mice that had been reconstituted with hPK prior
May 2015

to tMCAO were again fully susceptible to edema formation. Of note, PK obviously regulates endothelial permeability also in other vascular beds, for instance in the
retina.48
Significantly fewer neutrophils and macrophages/
activated microglia invaded the brains of PK-deficient
mice after tMCAO. Neutrophils and macrophages/microglia have been shown to be involved in stroke development
by producing free radicals and other neurotoxic factors.8
Moreover, neutrophils can impair tissue reperfusion by
interacting with platelets and endothelial cells, a phenomenon commonly referred to as “no reflow.”49 Accordingly,
CBF in the cerebral microvasculature of Pk2/2 mice was
significantly enhanced during the reperfusion phase after
tMCAO, although less thrombus formation probably contributed to this effect as well. Interestingly, PK has been
shown to directly activate neutrophils.50 Although the
findings from our PK and BK reconstitution experiments
strongly suggest a causal link between reduced thromboinflammation and neuroprotection after stroke in the
absence of PK, we cannot definitely exclude that some of
the alterations found in Pk2/2 mice were related to smaller
infarct volumes.
We applied a highly specific antibody to block PK
activity in WT mice.15 Lack of specificity is the main
limitation of aprotinin, which has been used as a PK
inhibitor in previous experimental stroke studies, however
with conflicting results.7 C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-Inh)
is the main endogenous inhibitor of PK, and application
of exogenous C1-Inh protects rodents from brain ischemia–reperfusion injury.12 However, like aprotinin, C1Inh also interacts with other components of the contactkinin system, for example, FXII or the complement system.7 Ecallantide (DX-88) inhibits PK with a high level
of specificity and is already approved for the treatment of
hereditary angioedema.51 In a proof-of-principle study,
Storini et al52 evaluated the efficacy of ecallantide in a
mild model of ischemic stroke (30 minutes of tMCAO)
in mice. Ecallantide significantly reduced infarct size and
improved functional outcome, but efficacy was lost when
ecallantide was applied beyond a 30-minute time window
or in a model of permanent ischemia. In addition, the
consequences on thrombus formation or inflammation
were not investigated in this study.52 That the PKspecific antibody used here was effective even when
applied in a delayed setting, that is, 3 hours after the
induction of tMCAO, is promising from a clinical perspective, as is its beneficial action on thromboinflammation. Although it is possible in principle that the a-PK
antibody can readily cross the damaged BBB after
tMCAO in mice and therefore, might exert direct effects
within the central nervous system after stroke, such a

scenario appears unlikely given its well-established mode
of action and its specificity for the plasmatic protease
PK.
Even if blocking of PK is a promising strategy to
counteract different detrimental pathways in ischemic
stroke in mice, the relevance of our findings in humans
still needs to be established and several caveats remain.
First, observations from laboratory animals in many cases
cannot be easily transferred to the clinical situation, in
particular in the field of experimental stroke research.19
Second, PK might not exclusively act prothrombotically
but has also been suggested to promote endogenous fibrinolysis.10,41 Finally, the contact-kinin system is part of
the host defense network by activating the complement
system or generating antimicrobial peptides.10 Hence,
blocking of the contact-kinin system could further
enhance stroke-induced immunodepression53 albeit complement levels in Pk2/2 mice were unchanged in our
study.
In summary, inhibition of PK improves stroke outcome by a combined antithrombotic and antiinflammatory mechanism. Interfering with the contactkinin system might become an effective and safe strategy
to combat this devastating neurological condition and
possibly other thromboembolic disorders.
