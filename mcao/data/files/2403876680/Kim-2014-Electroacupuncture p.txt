Abstract
To investigate the question of whether electroacupuncture (EA) promotes functional recovery via enhancement of
proliferation and differentiation of neuronal stem cells (NSCs) in ischemic stroke, EA stimulation with 2 Hz was applied at
bilateral acupoints to Baihui (GV20) and Dazhui (GV14) in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice. EA stimulation
improved neuromotor function and cognitive ability after ischemic stroke. EA stimulation resulted in an increase in the
number of proliferated cells, especially in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Although a very
limited number of NSCs survived and differentiated into neurons or astrocytes, EA treatment resulted in a significant
increase in the number of proliferative cells and differentiated cells in the hippocampus and SVZ of the ipsilateral
hemisphere compared to MCAO mice. EA stimulation resulted in significantly increased mRNA expression of brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Protein levels of these factors were confirmed in
the ipsilateral hippocampus and SVZ by immunohistochemical and Western blotting analyses. Expression of phosphorylated
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, BDNF, and VEGF-mediated down-stream were enhanced by EA stimulation in newly formed
neuroblasts. These results indicate that EA treatment after ischemic stroke may promote post-stroke functional recovery by
enhancement of proliferation and differentiation of NSCs via the BDNF and VEGF signaling pathway.

survival cells from newborn neuronal precursors have been
identified [3,10,11].
Endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) produce new neurons and
possibly improve neurological impairments; therefore, they can
provide potential therapeutic targets for stroke therapy [3,7].
Appropriate therapeutic strategy may be developed for stroke, if
the transient increase of NSCs proliferation and their maturation
can be stimulated by any treatment [10,11]. Electroacupuncture
(EA), engrafted electric stimulation, is accepted as a common
complementary therapy for treatment of stroke and post-stroke
rehabilitation [12]. EA stimulation at a low frequency of 2 Hz
induces differential regulation of more genes related to neurogenesis [13]. EA treatment may enhance cell proliferation and
differentiation in the neurogenic area under post-ischemic
conditions, which is associated with improved brain function.
However, EA studies have either been on adult animal models
or have involved cell proliferation only in restricted areas without
any further study [13–15]. The functional recovery and molecular
mechanisms underlying the neurogenesis induced by EA stimulation in the brain remain obscure. Results showing that EA
treatment can induce proliferation and differentiation of NSCs
and then show a beneficial effect for neurorepair in stroke would
provide evidence for its utility as a neurogenesis-stimulating

Introduction
Persistent neurogenesis has been identified in two restricted
regions, namely the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral
ventricle and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal
dentate gyrus, in the adult mammalian brain, including humans,
not only in developing ones [1–3]. Many stimuli, exogenously
applied agents, and endogenous factors or states appear to regulate
adult neurogenesis [4]. Factors including exercise, environmental
enrichment, spatial learning, pregnancy, and stroke are associated
with up-regulation of adult neurogenesis in these regions, whereas
stress and aging are associated with its down-regulation [4,5].
Stroke is a leading cause of long-term motor disabilities relying
on rehabilitation therapy because there is no effective treatment
except tissue type plasminogen activator during the first hours
after a stroke [6]. However, this therapy can only be administered
to a small percentage of patients, and there is no effective
treatment for improvement of functional recovery in the postischemic phase [7,8]. Functional recovery after stroke can
potentially be induced by stimulation of endogenous neurogenesis
[9]. After stroke, the brain maintains the potential for neuronal
replacement by persistence of neurogenesis from the SVZ, the
SGZ, and the neocortical layer, however, a very limited number of

treatment was administered with 2 Hz stimulation for 20 min and
output voltage was set at 2 volts. EA was administered once per
day for a successive 10 days from five days after MCAO. Subjects
in the non-EA groups received only light isoflurane anesthesia for

therapy in stroke. Therefore, we hypothesized that EA treatment
after ischemic stroke would have functional benefits via enhancement of neurogenesis and maturation of NSCs in the brain, which
could be helpful in development of better therapeutic treatments
for stroke. We selected a mouse model of cerebral ischemiareperfusion injury and investigated the proliferation and maturation of NSCs with neurofunctional recovery by EA stimulation and
cell survival-related factors and its down-stream pathways
underlying adult neurogenesis.

Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) Labeling
BrdU (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) is a synthetic thymidine
analog that becomes incorporated into a cell’s DNA when the cell
is dividing during the S-phase of the cell cycle. For labeling of
proliferating cells, all animals were injected with BrdU (50 mg/kg
i.p.) once daily for 10 successive days during EA stimulation.

Materials and Methods
Animal
Male C57BL/6 mice, aged 10 weeks, were obtained from
Dooyeol Biotech (Seoul, Korea). The mice were housed at 22uC
under alternating 12 h cycles of dark and light, and were fed a
commercial diet and allowed tap water ad libitum throughout the
study. All experiments were approved by the Pusan National
University Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with
the National Institutes of Health Guidelines. Each group consisted
of six mice and all treatments were administered under isoflurane
(Choongwae, Seoul, Korea) anesthesia, which was provided using
a calibrated vaporizer (Midmark VIP3000, Orchad Park, OH,
USA). Figure 1 shows the schematic diagram for experimental
procedures and all experiments were performed on the indicated
day.

Behavioral Assessment
Motor coordination and equilibrium were measured using a
rotarod apparatus (Panlab S.L.U., Barcelona, Spain). After
adaptation trials, each mouse was placed on the rotating rod for
three trials per day at a speed of 20 rpm for 3 min and the time
that an animal was able to hold itself on the rod was recorded.
Acquisition training for the Morris water maze was performed on
four consecutive days from 10 days to seven days before MCAO
(five trials per day) and basal time was measured at six days before
MCAO. The tank had a diameter of 100 cm and an altitude of
50 cm. The platform was placed 0.5 cm beneath the surface of the
water. Each trial was performed for 90 s or until the mouse arrived
on the platform. Results of the experiment were recorded using
SMART 2.5.18 (Panlab S.L.U.).

Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by occluding the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) using the intraluminal filament technique.
A fiber-optic probe was affixed to the skull over the middle
cerebral artery for measurement of regional cerebral blood flow
using a PeriFlux Laser Doppler System 5000 (Perimed, Stockholm,
Sweden). Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was
induced by a silicon-coated 4-0 monofilament in the internal
carotid artery and the monofilament was advanced to occlude the
MCA. The filament was withdrawn 40 min after occlusion and
reperfusion was confirmed using laser Doppler.

Immunohistochemistry
Mice anesthetized with isoflurane received intracardial perfusion with saline and then 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains
were removed, post-fixed in the same fixative for 4 h at 4uC, and
immersed in 30% sucrose for 48 h at 4uC for cryoprotection.
Frozen 14 mm-thick sections were incubated for blocking with a
blocking buffer (1X PBS/5% normal goat serum/0.3% triton X100) for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were incubated
with the following primary antibodies to BrdU (AbD Serotec,
Oxford, UK), doublecortin (Dcx, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA), neuronal nuclei (NeuN, Millipore
Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA), glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP, Millipore Corporation), mature brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (mBDNF, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), BDNF precursor
(preBDNF, Santa cruz Biotechnology), vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF, Santa cruz Biotechnology), phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pPI3K, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and
phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase (pERK, Cell

EA Stimulation
Under light isoflurane anesthesia, two bilateral stainless-steel
0.18 mm-diameter needles were inserted to a depth of approximately 2 mm at the acupoints corresponding to Baihui (GV20, the
midpoint of the line connecting the apexes of both ears on the
parietal bone) and Dazhui (GV14, the posterior midline and in the
depression below the spinous process of the seventh cervical
vertebra) in men, and were connected to a Grass S88 electro-

4uC. After washes with PBS, the sections were incubated with the
fluorescent secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) and DAPI (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) for 2 h and 30 min at room temperature in the dark,
respectively, and then washed with PBS three times. Subsequently,
slides were mounted in the mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and captured using a fluorescence microscope (Carl
Zeiss Imager M1, Carl Zeiss, Inc., Gottingen, Germany) and a
laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss, Inc.).

Western Blot
Each brain tissue punch was washed in cold HEPES buffer and
homogenized in lysis buffer [200 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM
NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaF, 1% NP40, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride, 1 mM Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor
cocktail]. Equal amounts of proteins were then separated by 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer of the resolved proteins to a nitrocellulose
membrane (Whatman, Dassel, Germany). The membranes were
incubated with the same primary antibody used in immunohistochemistry overnight at 4uC. Subsequently, membranes were
incubated with secondary antibody. Actin was used as a loading
control for all experiments. Quantification of immunoreactivity
corresponding to the bands was performed by densitometric
analysis using an ImageQuant LAS 4000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).

Reverse Transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (RTPCR)
Total RNA was prepared from brain tissue treated with
TRIZOL reagentTM (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) according to the
manufacturer’s protocols. cDNA was synthesized using 2 mg of
total RNA and oligodT(18) primer with taq polymerase (Promega
Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) in a 25 ml total reaction volume.
Reverse transcription was performed by incubating the mixture at
37uC for 45 min, and the reaction was terminated at 95uC for
5 min. The following primers were used: 59-AGGTGAGAAGAGTGATGACCATCC-39 (forward), and 59-CAACATAAATCCACTATCTTCCCC-39

Data Analyses
All data are expressed as mean6SEM and were analyzed using
the Sigmastat statistical program Version 11.2 (Systat Software,
San Jose, CA, USA). Statistical analysis of data was performed
using Student’s t-test when comparing two groups, or one-way
ANOVA via Tukey’s post hoc comparison when comparing more
than two groups. A p,0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Effects of EA Treatment On Post-stroke Behavior
To determine whether EA stimulation can improve the recovery
of damaged neural function induced by MCAO, the rotarod and
Morris water maze tests were applied and the mouse’s neuromotor
and cognitive dysfunction was evaluated. No difference in the
rotarod test of normal mice was observed between groups,
however, EA-treated MCAO mice showed a significantly longer
mean time compared with MCAO mice at 40 and 47 days after
MCAO (Figure 2A). In the Morris water maze test, both MCAO
and MCAO+EA mice took a longer time on average to find the
platform than basal. However, compared with MCAO mice, EAtreated mice attained a significantly lower time from 44 to 46 days
after MCAO (Figure 2B). These results suggest that EA treatment

can induce beneficial effects for improvement of neuromotor and
cognitional function in a focal cerebral ischemia model.

Effects of EA Treatment On Neurogenesis in the Whole
Brain
To evaluate the effects of EA stimulation on endogenous NSCs,
cells were identified by BrdU labeling and by a specific molecular
marker such as Dcx and NeuN at 26 days after MCAO. At each
600 mm interval, 11 sections were taken for staining with cresyl
violet or other molecular markers. We divided the whole brain
into 11 coronal sections, as shown in Figure 3A, and then the total
number of NSCs was evaluated by counting BrdU positive cell and
double-positive cells for BrdU/Dcx or BrdU/NeuNs. The number
of proliferated cells indicated by BrdU labeling was increased in
both the ipsilateral and contralateral hemisphere of MCAO mice.
EA stimulation resulted in a significant increase in the number of
BrdU positive cells from the 8th to 11th coronal sections (from 2
1.9 mm to 23.8 mm to bregma) compared with MCAO mice
(Figures 3B and 3C). Because it cannot be assumed that BrdU
positive cells in the ischemic brain are newly born, we detected colocalization of BrdU with Dcx or NeuN, which is used routinely
for identification of newly born neuroblasts and neurons.
Compared with the total number of BrdU positive cells, the
number of BrdU/Dcx or NeuN double-positive cells was very low,
and no significant difference was observed throughout each of the
coronal sections. However, the total number of BrdU with Dcx or

Effects of EA Treatment On Proliferation and
Differentiation of NSCs
To compare the effects of EA stimulation on proliferation and
differentiation of NSCs, we selected two coronal sites, 3rd,4th
(0.8,0.4 mm to bregma) and 8th,9th (–1.9,–2.5 mm to bregma)
sections at 14 and 47 days after MCAO, and then counted each
positive cell in the hippocampus, SVZ and cortex (Figure 4A). At
14 days after MCAO, the number of BrdU positive cells showed a
significant increase in the ipsilateral hemisphere compared with
the contralateral, especially in the SVZ. NeuN positive cells were
very rarely detected on this day (data not shown). A very limited
number of cells showed a BrdU/Dcx double positive reaction
compared to proliferated cells, however, these cells were significantly increased by EA stimulation in the hippocampus and SVZ
of the ipsilateral hemisphere (Figures 4B–E). At 47 days after
MCAO, we identified differentiated neurons or astrocytes from
NSCs. The majority of surviving cells were differentiated into
neurons or astrocytes. EA stimulation resulted in a significant

increase in the number of both BrdU/NeuN and BrdU/GFAP
double-positive cells in the hippocampus and SVZ (Figure 5).
These results suggest that EA treatment can increase the number
of newly formed neuroblasts and enhance differentiation into
neurons or astrocytes in the ipsilateral hippocampus and SVZ of
MCAO mice.

Effects of EA Treatment On Expression of pPI3K and pERK
in Newly Born Cells
To determine whether down-stream signaling of BDNF and
VEGF are involved in EA-induced neurogenesis, we observed the
expression of phosphorylated PI3K and ERK in newly formed
cells at 14 days after MCAO. Co-localized cells for BrdU with
pPI3K were observed very rarely in both MCAO and MCAO+EA
mice; however, cells for BrdU and pERK were barely detected.
EA stimulation resulted in an increase in the number of pPI3K/
BrdU double positive cells in all regions examined (Figure 9).
These results suggest that EA stimulation may improve proliferation of NSCs against ischemic induction through activation of
BDNF and VEGF mediated down-stream PI3K.

Effects of EA Treatment On Growth and Neurotrophic
Factors
Growth and neurotrophic factors are potent regulators of adult
neurogenesis. For screening of potential factors involved in EA
stimulation, we performed RT-PCR analysis for the whole
hemisphere at 14 days after MCAO, the last session of EA.
BDNF and VEGF mRNA levels were significantly increased by
EA stimulation in the ipsilateral hemisphere and no differences
were observed in other factors (Figure 6). Immunohistochemistry
and Western blot were performed in order to confirm BDNAF and
VEGF expression by EA stimulation. Results of Western analysis
showed that EA stimulation significantly improved expression of
mBDNF and VEGF in the hippocampus and in both the
hippocampus and cortex of the ipsilateral hemispheres, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that EA stimulation
induced a significant increase in the number of mBDNF positive
cells in the ipsilateral hippocampus and SVZ. The number of
VEGF positive cells in the hippocampus and ipsilateral SVZ was
also significantly increased by EA stimulation (Figures 7 and 8).
These results suggest that BDNF and VEGF may play critical roles
in EA-induced neurogenesis of MCAO mice.

Discussion
The adult brain is capable of replacing some lost neurons after
stroke injury via three distinct steps, proliferation, migration, and
differentiation of NSCs [16]. Marked cell proliferation and
generation of neuroblasts has been reported in the SVZ following
stroke injury; these cells migrate to the damaged area in the
striatum [10,11,17]. New neurons from SVZ persist for a long
term after stroke, at least several months [17–19]. Ultimately,
neuroblasts that have migrated to injury sites show differentiation
into a region-appropriate phenotype that becomes functionally
integrated into neural networks for participation in brain repair
and functional recovery after stroke [10,17,20,21].
Although newly born cells can be supplied from several origins,
including SVZ, SGZ, and the neocortical layer in the post-stroke
brain, the number is too small for recovery of neurologic functions

Transient forebrain ischemia increases the number of NSCs and
results in a peak level of proliferation at around 1–2 weeks after
ischemic injury [3,10,11,22]. Thus, we administered EA stimulation from five days to 14 days after MCAO on time showing a
peak level of proliferated NSCs. We found that EA treatment after
ischemic stroke resulted in improved neuronal function and
induced proliferation and differentiation of NSCs.
We detected newborn cells when newborn neuroblasts expressed both specific marker, Dcx and NeuN (at 26 days after
MCAO, three weeks after EA stimulation) [27]. EA treatment
resulted in up-regulation of adult neurogenesis after stroke,
however, in accordance with previous studies, very limited survival
of newborn neuronal precursors was observed against the total
number of BrdU positive proliferated cells [10,11]. However, the
increase in total numbers of BrdU/Dcx or NeuN double-positive
cells indicates that EA stimulation may play beneficial roles in
enhancement of proliferation and maturation of NSCs.
Thus, we compared proliferation and differentiation of NSCs in
specific sites, including hippocampus, SVZ, and cortex at early
and late phase after MCAO (14 days and 47 days after MCAO).
The number of BrdU positive cells showed a significant increase in

[3,22,23]. The fraction of dead striatal neurons that are replaced
by newly born neurons at six weeks after insult is only about 0.2%
[11]. These previous studies have provided comprehensive
evidence indicating that strategies for neuronal replacement
through adult endogenous neurogenesis may be of potential
therapeutic value for stroke. However, simple proliferation of
NSCs does not guarantee successful recovery from functional
impairments. In order to become a therapeutic strategy for stroke,
neurogenesis for capacity of self-repair has to be optimized for
improvement of the poor survival of newborn neurons [11].
Positive effects of acupuncture are well known as a treatment for
achievement of functional recovery after stroke [12,24]. Thus,
acupuncture signals that ascend mainly through the spinal
ventrolateral funiculus to the brain may improve adult neurogenesis as a potent form of sensory stimulation [25]. EA treatment
enhances stroke-induced striatal neurogenesis [26] and promotes
neurological functional recovery via modulation of a key regulator
of neurogenesis, retinoic acid [15]. The combination treatments of
EA and NGF have a synergistic effect on cell proliferation and
survival of NSCs, which is attributed to enhanced functional
recovery [14].

the SVZ of MCAO mice, compared with other sites, and EA
treatment resulted in an increase in the number of these cells at
early phase after MCAO. Neuroblast marker Dcx was observed in
proliferated NSCs at early phase after MCAO, however, neuron
and astrocyte markers, NeuN and GFAP, were detected at late
phase. Fewer BrdU/NeuN and GFAP double-positive cells were
detected in the SVZ and cortex at late phase after MCAO,
compared with Brdu/Dcx positive cells at early phase, indicating
loss or migration of NSCs during maturation. However, a larger
number of differentiated cells was detected in the hippocampus,
which may have caused migration of NSCs from a ventricular area
caudal to the SVZ into the hippocampus in response to ischemia
[28], namely the subcallosal zone (SCZ) and caudal extension of
the SVZ [29]. NSCs in the neocortex of adult rats are also
provided as a source of neurogenesis under ischemic conditions
[23], however, no significant changes in the number of differentiated cells were observed by EA treatment.
Growth and neurotrophic factors have recently emerged as an
important regulator of adult neurogenesis [4,27]. Delivery of a
neurotrophic factor can be a useful strategy for optimization of
neurogenesis that improves the poor survival of newborn neurons.
Acupuncture exerts therapeutic effects on animal models of
pathologies through modulation of neurotrophin content in both
the central nervous system and peripheral tissues [30].
Our results showed that BDNF and VEGF mRNA levels were
significantly increased by EA treatment among considerable six
factors considered as important regulators of adult neurogenesis.
BDNF and angiogenesis factor VEGF are two important
neurotrophic factors that have multiple effects on neurogenesis.
BDNF and VEGF stimulate adult neurogenesis and enhance the
appearance and migration of new neurons in the SVZ and dentate
gyrus [31–34]. Post-ischemic intravenous BDNF treatment

improves long-term functional neurological outcome for induction
of neurogenesis [33,35]. VEGF induces adult neurogenesis during
exposure to an enriched environment or voluntary exercise [27]
and reduces apoptosis after its infusion, suggesting a survival
promoting effect of NSCs [36].
In examination of the brain by immunohistochemistry and
Western blot, enhanced expression of mBDNF and VEGF
occurred in parallel with the cellular proliferation and survival of
NSCs. The current results imply potential roles of the BDNF and
VEGF signaling pathway underlying the survival of NSCs. BDNF
and VEGF mediate down-stream signaling cascades for survival of
NSCs, such as PI3K/Akt or ERK pathways, via activation of the
tyrosine kinase receptor (TrkB) and VEGF receptor 2, respectively
[37–40]. After the last session of EA, an increase in the number of
pPI3K positive cells was detected in BrdU positive cells.
In the current study, EA treatment improved neuronal function
and induced proliferation and differentiation of NSCs through
BDNF and VEGF signaling. The enhanced endogenous proliferation and maturation of NSCs in EA-treated mice may explain
why functional recovery was observed after ischemic stroke.
Consequently, EA stimulation induces proliferation of NSCs and
promotes differentiation of proliferated cells into neurons or
astrocytes, and provides the theoretical basis for a beneficial
mechanism of EA treatment in post-ischemic stroke.
