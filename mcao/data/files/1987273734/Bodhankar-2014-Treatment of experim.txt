Abstract Clinical stroke induces inflammatory processes leading to cerebral and splenic injury and profound peripheral
immunosuppression. IL-10 expression is elevated during major
CNS diseases and limits inflammation in the brain. Recent
evidence demonstrated that absence of B-cells led to larger
infarct volumes and CNS damage after middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) that could be prevented by transfer of IL10+ B-cells. The purpose of this study was to determine if the
beneficial immunoregulatory effects on MCAO of the IL-10+
B-cell subpopulation also extends to B-cell-sufficient mice that
would better represent stroke subjects. CNS inflammation and
infarct volumes were evaluated in male C57BL/6J (WT) mice

that received either RPMI or IL-10+ B-cells and underwent
60 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed
by 96 h of reperfusion. Transfer of IL-10+ B-cells markedly
reduced infarct volume in WT recipient mice when given 24 h
prior to or 4 h after MCAO. B-cell protected (24 h pre-MCAO)
mice had increased regulatory subpopulations in the periphery,
reduced numbers of activated, inflammatory T-cells, decreased
infiltration of T-cells and a less inflammatory milieu in the
ischemic hemispheres of the IL-10+ B-cell-treated group. Moreover, transfer of IL-10+ B-cells 24 h before MCAO led to a
significant preservation of regulatory immune subsets in the IL10+ B-cell protected group presumably indicating their role in
immunomodulatory mechanisms, post-stroke. Our studies are
the first to demonstrate a major immunoregulatory role for IL10+ regulatory B-cells in preventing and treating MCAO in WT
mice and also implicating their potential role in attenuating
complications due to post-stroke immunosuppression.

Introduction
Stroke remains the third leading cause of death in adults
worldwide and the most frequent cause of permanent disability in the world (Donnan et al. 2008). Ischemic stroke, that
occurs as a result of an obstruction within a blood vessel
supplying blood to the brain, accounts for 87 % of all stroke
cases, in the United States alone (Go et al. 2013). While
reperfusion of the ischemic brain is clearly desirable, tissue
damage often results from both the transient ischemic insult
and the reperfusion process. Reperfusion frequently induces
an inflammatory response that either causes additional injury
to the cerebral microcirculation and adjacent brain tissue
(Arumugam et al. 2005) causing substantial secondary brain
damage or may lead to potential repair mechanisms (Iadecola
and Anrather 2011).
Key features of the neuroimmunological response to brain
ischemia are early microglial activation (Mabuchi et al. 2000)
and subsequent recruitment of circulating leukocytes to the
ischemic brain (Iadecola and Anrather 2011; Macrez et al.
2011). Inhibition of this early inflammatory response improves outcome in experimental stroke, but clinical trials
aimed at preventing leukocyte trafficking into the ischemic
brain were unsuccessful (Investigators 2001). Recent experimental data demonstrate the complexities of modulating the
immune response after stroke and suggest that immune cells
can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. With the
experimental model influencing the time course and number
of infiltrating immune cells as well as the degree of microglial
activation (Zhou et al. 2013), it becomes obvious that the
timing and duration of interventions aimed at modulating
inflammation are critical. Hence, one of the rapidly evolving
areas of focus in stroke research involves defining the molecular and cellular basis for the augmented tissue injury and
inflammation associated with transient cerebral ischemia.
Our lab has been actively investigating these post-ischemic
inflammatory mechanisms and the interaction of activated
immune cells with the ischemic brain tissue. Recently, we
demonstrated that B-cells are critical in governing infarct size
and that MCAO-induced changes were prevented in B-celldeficient (μMT-/-) mice after transfer of highly purified wildtype (WT) B-cells, but not IL-10-deficient B-cells, thus implicating IL-10-secreting B-cells as a major regulatory cell
type in stroke (Offner and Hurn 2012; Ren et al. 2011). In
fact in our preceding study (Bodhankar et al. 2013a), we
demonstrated that when B-cell-deficient mice were
replenished with IL-10-rich B-cells 24 h prior to MCAO, there
was a significant decrease in infarct volume. We also demonstrated that the proinflammatory responses in the B-celldeficient recipient mice were inhibited not only in brain but
also in the periphery. With the important question about
sufficiency of the IL-10+ B-cells in regulating infarct size in
the B-cell-deficient mice being addressed, we decided to take

Metab Brain Dis (2014) 29:59–73

our studies further, since results obtained in B-cell-deficient
mice do not directly translate to a clinical perspective.
The primary purpose of the present study was to assess the
immunoregulatory role of IL-10-rich B-cells in impacting
infarct size in B-cell-sufficient mice. Hence, these studies
were carried out in C57BL/6J (wild-type, WT) mice. The goal
of these studies was to test the efficacy of IL-10-rich B-cells in
controlling infarct size when given prophylactically (i.e. 24 h
before the induction of stroke) or therapeutically (i.e. 4 h after
MCAO-induction). Our results clearly demonstrate that the
transferred IL-10-rich B-cells influence the T-cells in the
periphery, which acquire decreased proinflammatory characteristics. The transfer of IL-10-producing B-cells also led to an
increase in the regulatory sub-populations in the periphery.
The regulation of peripheral immune responses eventually led
to decreased infiltration of immune cells into the ischemic
hemispheres of the IL-10+ B-cell-treated group. The transfer
of IL-10+ B-cells was also able to impact the inflammatory
milieu of the ischemic hemisphere. Our studies are the first to
demonstrate a major immunoregulatory role for IL-10+ Bcells in inhibiting reperfusion based cerebral injury and also
implicating their potential role in attenuating complications
due to post-stroke immunosuppression.

Materials and methods
Animals Male C57BL/6J (wild-type, WT) mice 8 to 12 weeks
of age and weighing 20 to 25 g (Jackson Laboratory, Sacramento, CA, USA) were used as recipients for all adoptive
transfers and induction of middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) and were housed at the Oregon Health and Science
University in accordance with institutional guidelines. Male
IL10-GFP reporter mice (on a C57BL/6J background) were
used at 8–10 weeks of age as donors for adoptive transfers and
were bred and housed in the Animal Resource Facility at the
Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center in accordance with
institutional guidelines. The IL10-GFP reporter mice have a
floxed neomycin-IRES eGFP cassette (Madan et al. 2009)
inserted between the endogenous stop site and the poly(A)
site of the Il10 gene to help track IL-10 producing cells
in vivo. The mice designated as Vert-X are homozygous,
develop normally and are viable and fertile without any obvious phenotype. All experimental protocols were approved by
Portland Veteran Affairs Medical Center and Oregon Health
and Science University Animal Care and Use Committees.
Cell sorting and adoptive transfer of B-cells Male IL-10 GFP
reporter mice served as donors of B-cells. Splenic CD19+ Bcells were purified using paramagnetic bead-conjugated antibodies (Abs) from the CD19 cell isolation kit and subsequently separated by AutoMACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA).
The negative fraction of the cells thus separated were CD19+

Metab Brain Dis (2014) 29:59–73

B-cells with a purity of ≥92 %. CD19+ B-cells were suspended
in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 % Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)
and cultured in the presence of 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide
(LPS, E. coli strain K12) for 48 h. After 48 h of culture, B-cells
were harvested from culture plates, washed free of LPS and
viable cells were counted using a hemocytometer with trypan
blue exclusion method. Five million purified IL-10-GFP+ Bcells from the donor mice were suspended in 100 μL RPMI
1640 medium and were transferred intravenously (i.v.) into
WT mice (experimental group) 24 h before MCAO for one set
of experiments and 4 h after MCAO for a second set of
experiments. Each WT mouse either received 5×106/100 μL
purified IL-10-GFP+ B-cells or 100 μL RPMI 1640 medium
(control group).
Middle cerebral artery occlusion model Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male WT mice for 60 min by
reversible right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
under isoflurane anesthesia followed by 96 h of reperfusion
as previously described (Chen et al. 2012). The surgeon was
blinded to treatment group. Head and body temperature were
controlled at 36.5±1.0 °C throughout MCAO surgery with
warm water pads and a heating lamp. Occlusion and reperfusion were verified in each animal by laser Doppler flowmetry
(LDF) (Model DRT4, Moor Instruments, Inc., Wilmington,
DE, USA). Occlusion was accomplished by introducing a 6-0
nylon monofilament (ETHICON, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA)
with a silicone-coated (Xantopren comfort light, Heraeus,
Germany) tip through an external carotid artery stump distal
to the internal carotid artery to the origin of the middle cerebral
artery. Adequacy of artery occlusion was confirmed by monitoring cortical blood flow at the onset of the occlusion with a
LDF probe affixed to the skull. Animals were excluded if
intra-ischemic LDF was greater than 25 % pre-ischemic baseline. After the occlusion, the incision was closed with 6-0
surgical sutures (ETHICON, Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA).
Then each animal was awakened during occlusion and was
placed in a separate cage with a warm water pad and heating
lamp. At the end of the 60 min ischemic period, mice were
briefly re-anesthetized, the laser Doppler probe was
repositioned over the same site on the skull, the occluding
filament was withdrawn for reperfusion, and the incision was
closed with 6-0 surgical sutures (ETHICON, Inc., Somerville,
NJ, USA). Each animal was then awakened and recovered in a
separate cage with a warm water pad.
Neurological deficit scores Neurological deficit scores were
determined at 1, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of reperfusion to confirm
ischemia and the presence of ischemic injury using a 0 to 4
point scale as follows: 0, no neurological dysfunction; 1,
failure to extend left forelimb fully when lifted by tail; 2,
circling to the contralateral side; 3, falling to the left; and 4,
no spontaneous movement or in a comatose state (Chen et al.

61

2012). Any animal without a deficit at 1 h of reperfusion was
excluded from the study.
Infarct volume analysis Individual performing infarct volume
analysis was blinded to treatment group. Mice were euthanized and brains collected at 96 h of reperfusion for 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride histology and then digital image
analysis of infarct volume as previously described (Chen et al.
2012). Images were analyzed using Sigma Scan Pro 5.0
Software (Systat, Inc., Point Richmond, CA). To control for
edema, regional infarct volume (cortex, striatum, and hemisphere) was determined by subtraction of the ipsilateral noninfarcted regional volume from the contralateral regional volume. This value was then divided by the contralateral regional
volume and multiplied by 100 to yield regional infarct volume
as a percent of the contralateral region.
Isolation of leukocytes from spleen and brain Spleens from
individual control and B-cell recipient WT mice were removed and a single-cell suspension was prepared by passing
the tissue through a 100 μm nylon mesh (BD Falcon, Bedford,
MA). The cells were washed using RPMI 1640. Red cells
were lysed using 1x red cell lysis buffer (eBioscience, Inc.,
San Diego, CA) and incubated for 3 min. Cells were then
washed twice with RPMI 1640, counted and resuspended in
stimulation medium (RPMI, containing 10 % FBS, 1 % sodium pyruvate, 1 % L-glutamine, 0.4 % βME). The brain was
divided into the ischemic (right) and nonischemic (left) hemisphere, dissociated mechanically through a 100 μm nylon
mesh screen, resuspended in 80 % Percoll (GE Healthcare,
Pittsburgh, PA) overlaid with 40 % Percoll and subjected to
density gradient centrifugation for 30 min at 1,600 rpm, according to a method described previously (Campanella et al.
2002). Inflammatory cells were removed from the interphase
for further analysis. Cells were then washed twice with RPMI
1640, counted and resuspended in stimulation medium. Cells
from individual brain hemispheres were evaluated by flow
cytometry.
Analysis of cell populations by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA) or eBioscience, Inc. (San Diego, CA)
as published (Offner et al. 2006a, b). Four-color (FITC, PE,
APC and PI/PerCP/PECy7) fluorescence flow cytometry
analyses were performed to determine the phenotypes of
splenocytes and brain leukocytes as previously published
(Offner et al. 2006a). Single-cell suspensions were washed
with staining medium (PBS containing 0.1 % NaN3 and 0.5 %
bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Illinois) and incubated with the
combinations of the following monoclonal antibodies: CD3
(17A2 BD Pharmingen), CD4 (GK1.5, BD Pharmingen),
CD8a (53–6.7, BD Pharmingen), CD11b (M1/70,
eBioscience), CD45 (Ly-5, BD Pharmingen), CD19 (1D3,

62

BD Pharmingen), CD1d (1B1, BD Pharmingen), CD122
(TM-β1 BD Pharmingen), ICAM-1 (3E2, BD Pharmingen),
LFA-1(M17/4, eBioscience), MHCII (2G9, BD Pharmingen),
CD69 (H1.2F3, BD Pharmingen), for 10 min at 4 °C. One mL
of staining buffer was added to wash the cells. Propidium
iodide (PI) was added to identify dead cells whenever only 3
channels on the FACSCalibur were used for detection of
fluorescent antibody staining. The FoxP3 staining kit was
used according to the manufacturer’s protocol (eBioscience)
and as previously described (Zhang et al. 2010). FACS data
acquisition was performed on FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and data were analyzed using
FCS express software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA).
Intracellular staining Intracellular staining was visualized
using a published immunofluorescence protocol (Subramanian
et al. 2011). Briefly, 2×106 cells/mL were resuspended in complete medium (RPMI 1640 containing 10 % fetal calf serum,
1 mM/L pyruvate, 200 μg/mL penicillin, 200 U/mL streptomycin, 4 mM/L L-glutamine, and 5×10−5 mol/L 2-β-ME) with
PMA (50 ng/mL), ionomycin (500 ng/mL), and Brefeldin A
(10 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h. For intracellular IL-10
detection, a modification was followed for the immunofluorescence staining protocol (Yanaba et al. 2008). Briefly, isolated
leukocytes or purified cells were resuspended (2×106 cells/mL)
in complete medium and cultured with LPS (10 μg/mL) in
addition to PMA (50 ng/mL), ionomycin (500 ng/mL), and
Brefeldin A (10 μg/mL) (all reagents are from Sigma-Aldrich)
for 4 h. Fc receptors were blocked with anti-FcR mAb (2.3G2;
BD PharMingen) before cell-surface staining, and fixed and
permeabilized with the Fixation/Permeabilization buffer
(eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Permeabilized cells were washed with 1X Permeabilization
Buffer (eBioscience) and were stained with tumor necrosis
factor-α (MP6-XT22; BD Pharmingen), IL-17A (TC1118H10, BD Pharmingen), Interferon-γ (XMG1.2; eBioscience),
and/or APC-conjugated anti-IL-10 (JES5-16E3; eBioscience)
mAb. Isotype matched mAb served as negative controls to
demonstrate specificity and to establish background TNF-α,
IL-17, IFN-γ and IL-10-staining levels.
Cytokine detection by Luminex bead array Single-cell suspensions of spleen and brain mononuclear cells obtained from
control (RPMI-treated) and IL-10+ B-cell-treated WT mice
96 h after MCAO were cultured in 24 well plate coated with
plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies for 48 h. Culture supernatants were evaluated for secreted levels of cytokines by
using a Luminex Bio-Plex cytokine assay kit according to the
instructions by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA).
RNA isolation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction Total RNA was isolated from brains of control and
IL-10+ B-cell recipient WT mice using the RNeasy mini kit

protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and converted into
cDNA using oligo-dT, random hexamers, and Superscript
RT II (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). Reverse
transcription-PCR was performed using TaqMan PCR master
mix and pre-designed Taqman primers for MCP-1 (CCL2),
MIP-1α (CCL3), RANTES (CCL5), MIF, CXCL2 (MIP-2),
CXCL13, CXCR5, IL-1β, TNF-α, TGF-β1 and IL-10
primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). mRNA
was quantified in reactions conducted on the ABI Prism 7000
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) and
data represented as relative units compared with the
GAPDH reference gene.
Statistical analysis Infarct volume data are presented as mean
± SEM. Differences in regional infarct volumes were determined with Student’s t-test. Functional outcomes for neurological deficit scores were analyzed by Mann Whitney Rank
Sum test. Statistical significance was p<0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat Statistical Software,
Version 9.01 (Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Statistical significance for the differences between percentages of
cellular subtypes by FACS analysis and cytokine production
by Luminex for splenocytes were analyzed with Student’s ttest. Statistical significance for data obtained by FACS analysis and Luminex for the brain leukocytes were analyzed by
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post
hoc Tukey’s test. The criterion for statistical significance was
p≤0.05. All values are reported as mean ± SEM. Significant
differences are denoted as *p≤0.05; **p≤0.01; ***p≤0.001.

Results
Mortality and exclusions
Overall mortality from MCAO for infarct volume and immunology studies was 7 mice out of a total of 102 mice, with
mortality ranging from 0 to 3 mice within the experimental
groups. Overall number of mice excluded due to intraischemic LDF greater than 25 % pre-ischemic baseline was
5 mice out of a total of 102 mice, with exclusions ranging
from 0 to 2 mice within the experimental groups.
Adoptive transfer of IL10+ B-cells, 24 h before or 4 h
after MCAO, reduces infarct volume in male WT mice
As shown in Fig. 1a, WT mice that received IL10+ B-cells (n=
10) 24 h before MCAO exhibited significantly reduced cortical (p=0.026), striatal (p=0.012) and total hemisphere (p=
0.016) infarct volumes after 60 min MCAO followed by 96 h
of reperfusion compared to no-cell transferred vehicle (RPMI)
controls (n=12). Representative cerebral sections from WT
mice treated with RPMI or IL10+ B-cells are shown in Fig. 1b.

Distribution of neurological deficit scores within each group
at each time point would suggest that adoptive transfer of
IL10+ B-cells 24 h before MCAO had a greater impact on
decreasing, and thus improving, the neurological deficit score
over time when compared to WT mice treated with RPMI
(Table 1). Differences in the median neurological deficit
scores between the experimental and control groups were
greater than would be expected by chance at 24 h reperfusion
(p=0.004) but not at 1 (p=0.245), 48 (p=0.218), 72 (p=0.103)
or 96 (p=0.103) hours reperfusion (Table 1).
As shown in Fig. 1c, WT mice that received IL10+ B-cells
(n=13) 4 h after MCAO exhibited significantly reduced cortical
(p=0.001), striatal (p=0.036) and total hemisphere (p=0.006)

infarct volumes after 60 min MCAO followed by 96 h of
reperfusion compared to no-cell transferred vehicle (RPMI)
controls (n=14). Representative cerebral sections from WT
mice treated with RPMI or IL10+ B-cells are shown in

group at each time point would suggest that adoptive transfer of

statistically significant differences were observed in the median
neurological deficit scores between the two experimental
groups at 1 (p=0.574), 24 (p=0.864), 48 (p=0.231), 72 (p=

B-cell-sufficient (WT) mice transferred with IL-10-GFP+
B-cells before MCAO-induction have significantly reduced
splenic atrophy

and B-cell-transferred WT mice. As expected and previously
demonstrated (Offner et al. 2006b; Bodhankar et al. 2013a),
MCAO resulted in large reductions in spleen cell numbers in
RPMI-treated WT mice. The reduction in spleen counts was
from ∼100 million spleen cells/naïve WT mouse (data not
shown) to ∼7–8 million spleens cells/WT mouse after 60 min
MCAO and 96 h of reperfusion, accounting for ∼93 % reduction
in the total splenocytes (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, the viable cell
counts were significantly higher (∼16–18 million cells/mouse) in
spleens of WT mice receiving IL-10 GFP+ B-cells as compared
to the RPMI-treated WT mice (p=0.048) 96 h following MCAO
(Fig. 2a). Given the partial restoration of splenic cell numbers in
the IL-10+ B-cell-treated group, we further evaluated the frequencies of specific surviving splenic cell types. There was a
significant increase in the percentages of both the CD4+ T-cells
(CD4+; p=0.002) and CD8+ T-cells (CD8+; p=0.047) in the
spleens of WT mice treated with IL-10-GFP+ B-cells (Fig. 2b).
However, there were no differences in the percentages (or absolute numbers; data not shown) of B-cells (CD19+) or monocytes
(CD11b+). After 96 h of reperfusion, the GFP+ B-cells comprised
only 2 % of the total splenocytes from WT recipient mice (data

As demonstrated in Fig. 1, transfer of IL-10+ B-cells, both 24 h
before and 4 h after MCAO-induction, led to reduced infarct
volumes. To further discern the regulatory role of IL-10+ Bcells on the developing infarct, we focused on their role in a
prophylactic scenario. Hence, immunological studies were carried out in WT recipients of RPMI- or IL-10+ B-cells 24 h
before MCAO-induction. This was in continuation and allowed
direct comparison with our preceding study (Bodhankar et al.
2013a) in which the IL-10+ B-cells were transferred to B-celldeficient mice 24 h before MCAO-induction.
Stroke-induced splenic atrophy is an established phenomenon
(Offner et al. 2006b). We were also able to demonstrate in our
preceding study that the transfer of the IL-10+ B-cells to μMT-/mice rescued stroke-induced splenic atrophy. Hence to ascertain
whether reduced ischemic brain injury in the WT mice also
entails less splenic atrophy in the B-cell-transferred group, cell
numbers in the spleen were evaluated in post-ischemic RPMI-

Fig. 2 B-cell-sufficient (WT) mice transferred with IL-10-GFP+ B-cells
24 h before MCAO-induction have significantly reduced splenic atrophy.
Ninety six hours after MCAO, mononuclear cells were isolated from
spleens of RPMI or IL-10-GFP+ B-cell recipient WT mice and analyzed
for: a Total cell count via hemocytometer. Values represent mean numbers
(±SEM) of indicated cell subsets from 16 to 17 mice in each group, from
at least 5 separate experiments; b Comparison of CD11b+ monocytes,

CD19+ B-cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations. Values represent
mean numbers (±SEM) of indicated cell subsets, gated on live leukocytes
(by PI exclusion), from 6 to 7 mice of each group, from at least 2 separate
experiments. Statistical analysis was performed with Student’s t-test to
compare between RPMI and IL-10-GFP+ B-cell recipient mice. Significant differences between sample means are indicated (*p≤0.05)

not shown), indicating that the increase in the cell numbers is not
contributed by the transferred cells, but rather may be due to the
influence of the transferred cells on the splenocyte distribution.

transferred WT mice, there was no difference in the percent
expression of MHCII (Fig. 3c).
To further correlate the reduction in infarct volumes and
splenic atrophy to the activation states of T-cells in spleens
that might be influencing the splenic milieu, we evaluated the
percent frequencies of CD44 and CD69 expression by CD4+
T-cells in the spleens of control vs. B-cell-replenished WT
mice. CD44 is a memory T-cell marker that is involved in Tcell activation, binding to selectins on the endothelium during
transmigration across the blood-brain barrier and release of
cytokines in brain to amplify the inflammatory response; and
CD69 is an ‘activation marker’ that is rapidly induced on
mature T-cells after stimulation through the TCR. As shown
in Fig. 3c, splenocytes from RPMI-treated WT mice, after
MCAO, had increased percentages of CD69+ CD4+ T-cells.
Transfer of IL-10 GFP+ B-cells prevented this increase,
resulting in a significant decrease in CD69 expression by
CD4+ T-cells (p=0.017) compared to RPMI-treated mice.
The percentage expression of CD44 expression between the
two groups was not different (data not shown). These results
indicate a dampening role played by the IL-10+ B-cells in
limiting both the proinflammatory responses and the activation states of specifically T-cells in the periphery after MCAO.

IL-10-GFP+ B-cells, transferred 24 h before MCAO, suppress
the pro-inflammatory state and inhibit activation of the T-cells
and monocytes in the periphery of recipient mice
It is now well established that the initial insult from stroke is
followed by an early induction of inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines that attract mononuclear cells and granulocytes,
which cause further damage to the ischemic and surrounding
areas of brain tissue (Offner et al. 2006a, 2009). To further
evaluate the possible regulatory effects of the IL-10-producing
B-cells on the resident spleen cells when transferred 24 h before
MCAO-induction, we evaluated the proinflammatory milieu in
the spleens by Luminex assay after 60 min of MCAO and 96 h
of reperfusion. Amongst the cytokines analyzed, the levels of
TNF-α (p=0.013) and IL-17 (p=0.043) were significantly reduced in the spleens of the B-cell-transferred group (Fig. 3a),
with a downward trend in MCP-1 as well. To discern the
cytokine production by specific cells (i.e. T-cells and monocytes)
in the spleens post-MCAO, Flow Cytometry was carried out on
ex vivo-activated cells (Fig. 3b). Monocytes (CD11b+ cells)
demonstrated a trend in the reduction of TNF-α, but there was
no difference in TNF-α production by the T-cells (CD3+ cells)
between the two recipient groups of WT mice. However, there
was a striking reduction in the production of IFN-γ by CD3+ Tcells (p=0.0001) and of IL-17 by CD4+ T-cells (p=0.027)
(Fig. 3b). Further, the expression of Major Histocompatibility
Complex class II and the co-stimulatory molecule CD80 on
monocytes were analyzed. On one hand, where the expression
of CD80 was significantly reduced (p=0.035) in the B-cell-

Transferred IL-10-GFP+ B-cells lead to an increase
in the regulatory cell populations and increased
anti-inflammatory status of the spleens
With the demonstration of attenuation of the proinflammatory
milieu and activation states of the T-cells and monocytes, we
next sought to determine whether the IL-10-rich B-cells, when
transferred 24 h before MCAO-induction, influence the frequencies of the various regulatory subpopulations in the periphery.

RPMI and IL-10-GFP+ B-cell recipient WT mice. Significant differences

Our earlier studies demonstrate that MCAO induced a 3 fold
increase in the percentage of Foxp3+CD4+ Tregs in the spleens
as compared to sham or naïve mice (Offner et al. 2006b). In our
preceding study (Bodhankar et al. 2013a), we also demonstrated
a significant increase in the frequencies of a recently identified
regulatory T-cell population, CD8+CD122+. Hence, we assessed
these known regulatory cells in the MCAO-protected IL-10GFP+ B-cell recipients by Flow Cytometry. We observed significant increases in the frequency of both Foxp3+CD4+ (p=
0.014) and CD8+CD122+ (p=0.003) Tregs, as well as the
CD1dhiCD19+ Bregs (p=0.044, Fig. 4) in the B-cell recipient
vs. control mice (Fig. 4). These results further confirm the
regulatory role of the donor IL-10 GFP+ B-cells.

Unlike our earlier study (Bodhankar et al. 2013a), where the
IL-10-GFP+ B-cells were transferred to B-cell-deficient
(μMT−/−) mice, our present study involved B-cell sufficient
WT recipients. Having previously demonstrated that B-cells are
the major producers of IL-10 post-MCAO (Ren et al. 2011), we
here similarly evaluated IL-10 production by the various cells in
the spleens by the Luminex assay. As demonstrated in Fig. 5a,
splenocyte supernatants from the B-cell-recipient WT mice had
significantly increased levels of IL-10 production. Further comparison of IL-10-producing capacities of recipient (GFP-) vs.
donor (GFP+) cells by Flow Cytometry revealed a significant
increase in the IL-10 production by the GFP- splenic cells in the
B-cell-transferred WT recipient mice. A low percentage of

Metab Brain Dis (2014) 29:59–73

67

recipients of regulatory B-cells (p=0.043 and p=0.017 respectively). These results confirm that the IL-10-GFP+ B-cells play a
protective role in the induction of regulatory T-cells and B-cells,
which in turn could contribute to immunomodulation in the
recipient mice after stroke.
Transfer of IL-10 GFP+ B-cells, 24 h before MCAO reduces
LFA-1 expression, possibly preventing migration of activated
T-cells outside of spleens

GFP+ transferred cells was also found in the spleens of the
recipient mice. As demonstrated in Fig. 5b, the total IL-10
GFP- percentage expressed by all cells in spleens was significantly higher (p=0.012) in the B-cell-recipient WT mice as
compared to the RPMI-treated mice, and we further demonstrated a significant increase in the IL-10-producing capacity of the
CD8+CD122+ and the CD1dhiCD19+ sub-populations in the

The intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) binds to the
lymphocyte function–associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). The interaction of ICAM-1 with LFA-1 is required for adhesion of
leukocytes to endothelium and their transmigration into tissues
of inflammation (Yang et al. 2005). Because the influx of
leukocytes into ischemic brain tissue contributes to brain damage, it seemed logical to investigate expression of these molecules in the periphery as agents that could be involved in
regulating this inflammatory response. As demonstrated in
Fig. 2b, the frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were significantly higher in the spleens of IL-10+ B-cell recipients. To
discern whether this difference is due to less apoptotic cells or
due to the retention of the cells in the periphery, the adhesion
molecules (ICAM-1 and LFA-1, respectively) on monocytes
and T-cells were determined by Flow Cytometry. While there
was no difference in the expression levels of ICAM-1 by the
monocytes between the two group of recipients (Fig. 6a), the
recipients of regulatory B-cells demonstrated a significant reduction in LFA-1 expression by both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells
(p=0.046 and p=0.043; respectively) (Fig. 6b). These data
suggest that down-regulation of adhesion molecules in the
periphery of the B cell-recipients may prevent a plausible
extravasation of activated/proinflammatory cells from the periphery to the target tissue of injury.

Fig. 5 Transferred IL-10-GFP+ B-cells lead to increased anti-inflammatory
status of the spleens. Splenocytes were isolated from RPMI or IL-10-GFP+

Transfer of IL-10-GFP+ B-cells to WT mice, 24 h
before MCAO, leads to reduced cerebral inflammatory cell
infiltration post-MCAO
Our earlier study demonstrated that with a reduction in the
infarct volumes there was also a reduction in infiltrating inflammatory cells into the ischemic brain hemispheres of the μMT-/mice transferred with IL-10-GFP+ B-cells (Bodhankar et al.
2013a). To determine whether the transfer of IL-10-GFP+ Bcells to WT mice also potentially influences cellular infiltration
leading to a similar reduction in the infiltration of the MCAOaffected hemisphere, we enumerated the total number of live
leukocytes obtained from each of the hemispheres. RPMItreated WT mice demonstrated a massive infiltration of leukocytes in the ischemic hemispheres after 96 h of reperfusion.
This cellular infiltration was significantly reduced (p=0.008) in
the MCAO-affected hemispheres of the IL-10-GFP+ B-cellsrecipient WT mice (Fig. 7a). The total cell yield from the
contralateral hemispheres of each of RPMI-transferred or Bcell-transferred WT recipients remained similar, confirming the
cellular infiltration on the ipsilateral side to be reperfusionrelated. We further evaluated the leukocyte composition in the
brains of the RPMI-treated (control) vs. IL-10-GFP+ B-celltreated (experimental) mice. Percentage of activated microglia/
infiltrating macrophages (CD11b+CD45high), total T-cells
(CD3+) and total B-cells (CD19+) were evaluated by Flow
Cytometry. After 96 h of reperfusion, the absolute numbers of
CD11b+CD45high (p=0.006), infiltrating CD3+ T-cells (p=
0.016) and CD19+ (p=0.026) subpopulations were significantly
reduced in the ipsilateral hemispheres of the MCAO-induced
B-cell-transferred group as compared to the control WT mice
(Fig. 7b). Transfer of IL-10+ B-cells also led to significant
reductions in percentages of total TNF-α producing leukocytes

Metab Brain Dis (2014) 29:59–73

(Fig. 7c, TNF-α+CD45+; p=0.025). Upon further characterizing the TNF-α-producing capacity, CD3+ T-cells from the Bcell transferred group demonstrated a significantly reduced
capacity to produce TNF-α after 96 h of reperfusion (Fig. 7c,
p=0.006). However, this was not true for the CD11b+ subpopulation (p=0.908) in the ischemic hemispheres of B-cell vs.
control recipient mice. These results confirmed that regulatory
effects of the IL-10-GFP+ B-cells in B-cell-sufficient (WT)
mice were similar to those demonstrated in μMT-/- mice. In
both cases, it appears that the major regulatory effects occur in
the periphery rather than in the brain, given that transferred IL10-GFP+ B-cells could not be found in the left (non-ischemic)
or right (ischemic) hemispheres of the brains of the experimental group (not shown).
Transfer of IL-10-GFP+ B-cells 24 h before MCAO induction
reduces the overall pro-inflammatory milieu in the ischemic
brain hemisphere
It is now known that ischemic stroke leads to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in spleen that can
result in local injury and also trigger a massive influx of
leukocytes from the periphery into the affected brain hemisphere, causing further damage. Hence, we determined the
cytokine-secreting ability of leukocytes in brain by culturing
mononuclear cells obtained from MCAO-affected ipsilateral
vs. unaffected contralateral hemispheres from experimental
and control mice. Culture supernatants were collected after
48 h and cytokine concentrations determined by the Luminex
assay. The results demonstrated a significant increase in the
levels of secreted proinflammatory factors (IL-1β, TNF-α and
MCP-1) from cells obtained from the ipsilateral vs. the contralateral hemispheres of the RPMI-treated control group.
However, there was a significant reduction in levels of the
proinflammatory factors but an increase in anti-inflammatory
IL-10 in the ipsilateral hemisphere of IL-10-GFP+ B-cell
treated mice vs. control mice (Fig. 8a).
Additionally, we determined expression of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes in the MCAO-affected
ipsilateral hemisphere by real time PCR 96 h after reperfusion.
As expected, mice transferred with IL-10-GFP+ B-cells demonstrated significantly decreased levels of proinflammatory
cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression as compared to
mice receiving RPMI (Fig. 8b), with striking differences for
the chemokines MIP-1α (p=0.032), MCP-1 (p=0.049) and
MIF (p=0.022), but not for RANTES and MIP-2. Interestingly, the expression level of CXCL13, known to play a role in
the recruitment of B-cells to the central nervous system (CNS)
compartment during neuroinflammation, was significantly
lower in the B-cell transferred group. There was no difference,
however, in expression of CXCR5, the receptor for CXCL13,
between the two groups. However, there was a significant
reduction (p=0.010) in expression of matrix metalloproteinase

migration through the basement membranes (Korpos et al.

Amongst the proinflammatory cytokines analyzed, there
was a significant reduction in the expression levels of IL-1β
(p=0.001) and TNF-α (p=0.047) in the MCAO-affected right
hemispheres of the mice that received B-cells. We also analyzed the expression levels of TGF-β1 and IL-10 that are
known as anti-inflammatory cytokines. As expected, there
was a significant increase (p=0.032) in the mRNA levels of
IL-10 in the right hemispheres of the mice that received Bcells (p<0.05). However, the relative expression levels of
mRNA for TGF-β1 were significantly reduced (p=0.008) in

the experimental group. These findings further confirm that
the transferred IL-10-GFP + B-cells create an antiinflammatory environment, thus impacting not only the immune cells in periphery, but also leading to an antiinflammatory milieu in the MCAO-affected brain hemisphere,
despite the 96 h reperfusion period.

Discussion
Ischemic stroke induces neurological deficits in almost onethird of the patients, leading to increased mortality and longterm functional disability (Castillo et al. 1997; Davalos et al.
1999). Among the many detrimental cascades (Lo et al. 2003)
that have been characterized to be elicited following ischemic

stroke, inflammatory mechanisms have come into focus in the
latest research. These inflammatory processes are known to
contribute substantially to secondary brain damage (Dirnagl
2004; Hurn et al. 2007; Wang et al. 2007), although the exact
underlying mechanisms have not been completely unraveled.
Studies in the transient MCAO model (Kleinschnitz et al. 2010)
indicate that the reconstitution of RAG1-/- mice with B cells led
to the development of significantly smaller brain infarcts as
compared to the WT controls. However, since the end-point of
these studies was as early as 22 h post-stroke, it was necessary
to investigate the role of B cells that can eventually affect the Tcell activation pathway beyond the 22 h post-MCAO window.
In our laboratory’s efforts in deciphering the different detrimental and/or beneficial arms of the immune system in post-

ischemic stroke, we were able to demonstrate the immunoregulatory role of IL-10-rich B-cells in B-cell-deficient mice
(Bodhankar et al. 2013a). Thus, our current study was initiated
as an extension of this previous study, taking into consideration
the caveat that in a clinical scenario, stroke subjects would not
likely have a complete B-cell-deficiency. The current study
addresses the hypothesis that the IL-10+ regulatory B-cells
would also play an immunoregulatory role in a B-cellsufficient environment. As shown above, we here demonstrate
the crucial role of IL-10+ B-cells in regulating infarct size in a
B-cell-sufficient environment, both at 24 h before and 4 h after
the induction of MCAO.
Inflammatory cascades in the course of the evolving ischemic brain damage are not restricted to resident cells of the

Metab Brain Dis (2014) 29:59–73

brain but also involve recruited immune cells from systemic
immune compartment (Iadecola and Anrather 2011; Liesz
et al. 2011). It is now clear that human stroke creates not just
a single organ insult, but a complex interaction between the
CNS and the peripheral immune system. Several mediators of
these inflammatory cascades have been previously described
and T lymphocytes are central to the development of sustained
inflammatory response. Cytokines involved in the proinflammatory response include IL-1β, IL-12, and IL-23, as well as
interferon-γ (IFN- γ), IL-17A, and TNF-α. In contrast, IL-4,
TGF-β, and IL-10 predominantly contribute to protective
pathways. However, the specific integration of each cell type
and cytokine in the post-ischemic inflammatory network still
needs to be elucidated. Also, there remain major unanswered
questions regarding mechanisms of antigen-independent T
cell activation within hours after stroke. In ischemia-related
inflammation, IL-17A can be crucial for chemokine induction.
Importantly, IL-17A has been characterized to be rapidly
released by γδT-cells in response to cytokine activation and/
or engagement of innate receptors, in the absence of TCR
activation. Similarly, IFN-γ pathways have also been implicated in ischemia/reperfusion injury. In lieu of the current
literature, our studies demonstrated a significant decrease in
IFN-γ and IL-17 production by splenic T-cells, in addition to
reductions in MCP-1 and TNF-α (Fig. 3a and b) in the IL-10+
B-cell-treated mice. That the regulatory impact of the IL-10+
B-cells included inflammatory T-cells was further confirmed
by a significant reduction in the activation marker, CD69, on T
helper cells (CD4+ T-cells) in the periphery (Fig. 3c).
Infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes is also a welldescribed feature of human stroke (Mena et al. 2004). Tcells are known to accumulate in the post-ischemic brain
within 24 h of focal cerebral ischemia (Brait et al. 2010), with
peak levels observed 72 h after cerebral ischemia (Gelderblom
et al. 2009). Consistent with these findings, our results also
demonstrate a significant infiltration of T-cells in the ischemic
hemispheres of the control mice, but reduced T cell and
proinflammatory cytokine levels in the IL-10+ B-celltransferred mice (Figs. 7 and 8). The potential importance of
B-cell-dependent neutralization of T cell infiltration and cytokine secretion is supported by previous studies demonstrating
an association between decreased T-cell cytokine levels (e.g.,
IL-17, IL-12, IL-23 and IFN-γ) and reduced infarct volume
and improved neurologic outcome scores over 7 days poststroke (Konoeda et al. 2010; Shichita et al. 2009). Our study
further demonstrated reduced mRNA expression of various
proinflammatory factors known to be important in promoting
cerebral damage (Tuttolomondo et al. 2008; Kowarik et al.
2012) in the ischemic hemispheres of the IL-10+ B-celltreated mice (e.g. MIP-1α, MCP-1, MIF, MMP-2, CXCL13,
IL-1β and TNF-α) vs. the RPMI-treated control mice. Of
note, B-cell-dependent reduction of MMP-2 expression could
reduce its enzymatic activity that promotes breakdown of the

71

extracellular matrix and blood brain barrier, producing hemorrhage and inflammation.
Our results validate the anti-inflammatory milieu generated
in the stroke-protected B-cell-recipients by demonstrating a
significant increase in the IL-10 levels in the ischemic hemispheres of these mice. However, TGF-β expression was significantly decreased. Although TGF-β from microglia and
macrophages may facilitate tissue repair by promoting the
resolution of inflammation and exerting direct cytoprotective
effects on surviving cells in the ischemic territory (Woodruff
et al. 2011), it is also well known for its proinflammatory
effects. One plausible explanation for our result might be that
increased IL-10 levels observed in the IL-10+ B-cellrecipients could reduce the need for the resident cells to
produce TGF-β to dampen the inflammation.
Recent studies indicate that the Foxp3+CD4+ Treg cell subpopulation plays multiple key roles as immunomodulators of
post-ischemic CNS injury, including regulating the immune
inflammatory response, limiting lesion development and promoting tissue repair (Chen et al. 2013; Liesz et al. 2009;
Stubbe et al. 2013; Offner et al. 2006b; Bodhankar et al.
2013b). Additionally, naturally occurring CD8+CD122+ regulatory T-cells (Rifa’i et al. 2004) can effectively suppress the
proliferation and IFN-γ production of both CD8+ and CD4+
T-cells by virtue of their IL-10 production (Rifa’i et al. 2008).
Moreover, regulatory B-cells (Bregs) are known to mediate
protection against other inflammatory CNS conditions (Mann
et al. 2007; Matsushita et al. 2010; Yanaba et al. 2008) and the
ability of Bregs to limit CNS injury is associated with antiinflammatory effects of IL-10 (Fillatreau et al. 2002). As
shown above, we here demonstrate the potent multi-faceted
ability of transferred IL-10+ B-cells to increase all three regulatory cell sub-populations in the periphery of the strokeprotected WT recipient mice (Fig. 4).
In summary, the current study demonstrates conclusively
the beneficial effects of IL-10+ regulatory B-cells in reducing
ischemic brain injury in B-cell-sufficient WT mice when administered 24 h prior to or 4 h after MCAO. B-cell treated
mice had significantly smaller lesion volumes after 96 h of
reperfusion. When B-cells were transferred 24 h before
MCAO-induction, reduction in infarct volume was attributed
to the significant reduction in the brain infiltrating cells as well
as the attenuated proinflammatory state in the stroke-affected
brain hemisphere. However, what makes our study of even
broader interest is the demonstration that the regulatory Bcells bring about their effect not only by directly impacting the
ischemic site but also by beneficially regulating peripheral
immune responses. This peripheral regulation involved 1)
preservation of splenocytes, 2) suppression of inflammatory
T-cells and prevention of their subsequent activation and
extravasation from the spleen, eventually leading to reduced
cellular infiltration of the ischemic cerebral hemisphere, and
3) augmentation of three different T/Breg subpopulations,

presumably indicating their role in immunomodulatory mechanisms, post-stroke. Thus, our novel findings are the first to
implicate IL-10-producing B-cells as a major regulatory mediator in WT mice with ischemic stroke.
