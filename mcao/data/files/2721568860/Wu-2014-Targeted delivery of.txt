Abstract
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a neuroprotective agent against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain injury. However,
its crossing of blood-brain barrier is limited. Focused ultrasound (FUS) sonication with microbubbles (MBs) can effectively
open blood-brain barrier to boost the vascular permeability. In this study, we investigated the effects of MBs/FUS on
extending the therapeutic time window of EPO and its neuroprotective effects in both acute and chronic phases. Male
Wistar rats were firstly subjected to two common carotid arteries and right middle cerebral artery occlusion (three vessels
occlusion, 3VO) for 50 min, and then the rats were treated with hEPO (human recombinant EPO, 5000 IU/kg) with or
without MBs/FUS at 5 h after occlusion/reperfusion. Acute phase investigation (I/R, I/R+MBs/FUS, I/R+hEPO, and I/
R+hEPO+MBs/FUS) was performed 24 h after I/R; chronic tests including cylinder test and gait analysis were performed one
month after I/R. The experimental results showed that MBs/FUS significantly increased the cerebral content of EPO by
bettering vascular permeability. In acute phase, both significant improvement of neurological score and reduction of infarct
volume were found in the I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS group, as compared with I/R and I/R+hEPO groups. In chronic phase, longterm behavioral recovery and neuronal loss in brain cortex after I/R injury was significantly improved in the I/R+hEPO+MBs/
FUS group. This study indicates that hEPO administration with MBs/FUS sonication even at 5 h after occlusion/reperfusion
can produce a significant neuroprotection.

provides a model for the study of ischemia-reperfusion injury [3].
This method can build a stable focal infarction in the brain. In
addition, reperfusion is performed easily by untying the suture
without plasminogen activator (t-PA) injection, and the effect of
neuroprotection can be directly reflected in this animal model.
It has been recently reported that focused ultrasound (FUS) with
microbubbles (MBs), which are ultrasound contrast agents in
clinical use, can disrupt the local BBB for providing trans-vascular
delivery of macromolecules [4,5]. The mechanism of MBs/FUSinduced vascular permeability change may be caused by the
opening of tight junction [6]. This disruption of BBB is transient
and reversible within several hours [5,7]. In recent study, MBs/
FUS has been used to facilitate the delivery of liposomal
doxorubicin into normal animal brains by opening the BBB[8].
The benefits of this delivery method have been demonstrated in
animal models with brain tumors [9–11] and Alzheimer’s disease
[12,13]. Although MBs/FUS may damage the brain parenchyma,

Introduction
The American Stroke Association [1] estimates that stroke
accounts for 1 out of every 18 deaths and occurs every 40 seconds
in the United States. In the 2012 update, the majority of strokes
were ischemic (87%); 10% were intracerebral hemorrhage; 3%
were due to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Ischemic stroke results
from the occlusion of a cerebral artery, leading to a blocked
cerebral blood flow to certain part of the brain. Two emergent
clinical therapies for acute ischemic stroke are: reperfusion of the
blood flow and neuroprotection of the injured brain cells. Early
reperfusion within 3 h is beneficial to improve the outcome of
acute human ischemic stroke. However, late recovery of circulation might cause reperfusion injury, resulting in blood-brain
barrier (BBB) breakdown, or brain edema [2].
Although many animal stroke models have been developed, no
single model can fully mimic clinical human stroke because of its
heterogeneity. The transient three vessels occlusion (3VO, two
common carotid arteries and middle cerebral artery) method

Delivery of hEPO by MBs/FUS for Neuroprotection

Figure 1. Experimental procedures. (A) For the hEPO+MBs/FUS group in the acute phase study, hEPO (i.v. injection) and first MBs/FUS were
applied approximately 5 h after a 50-min 3VO. A second MBs/FUS was given 15 min later. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after 3VO. (B) In the chronic
study, experimental groups were tested for motor deficits with gait analysis and cylinder test at indicated time points. Animals were sacrificed on Day

ultrasound (MBs/FUS). Temporary focal ischemia were based
on the model described by Chen et al [22]. The rats were
anesthetized by exposure to 1 to 3% isoflurane, and two common
carotid arteries (CCAs) were occluded by artery clips. A burr hole
was drilled at the anterior junction of the zygoma and the
squamosal bone, and the exposed middle cerebral artery (MCA)
was tied with a 10-0 suture. The above procedures were conducted
within 10 to 15 minutes. Rectal temperature was maintained at
3760.5uC. After an occlusion of 50 min, the suture was untied
and the reflow of the right MCA and two CCAs was confirmed
under a microscope.

a safe sonication can be achieved by regulating ultrasound
sonication and the dosage of MBs [4,14].
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a secreted glycoprotein produced
primarily by the kidney and is used clinically to treat anemia
[15,16]. EPO is induced by hypoxia within the central nervous
system. It has been reported that EPO is a promising acute
therapeutic agent for cerebral ischemia in animal studies [17]. The
protective mechanisms may include the activation of endogenous
survival pathways that inhibit apoptosis and further reduce
inflammatory responses [18,19]. Systemic administration of EPO
after induction of focal cerebral ischemia has been demonstrated
to exert a potential neuroprotective effect on the outcome of
stroke; however, there is a limited therapeutic time window. The
best application time is up to 3 h after ischemia with a leaky BBB
[20].
The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of utilizing
FUS with MBs to deliver hEPO to ischemia/reperfusion injured
rat brains beyond the conventional therapeutic time window and
to examine the efficacy of this treatment in both acute and chronic
phases.

Experimental Grouping
The experiments in this study include three parts: hEPO
quantification in brain tissues, acute response and chronic
response following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). First, to quantify
the amount of hEPO entering the sonicated brain, normal rats
were divided into two groups: received hEPO (CBC #329871,
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) (5000 IU/kg, i.v. injection)
only or hEPO plus MBs/FUS. The procedure was shown in
Fig. 1A. Second, to examine the neuroprotective effect of the
execution of hEPO and MBs/FUS on I/R, rats were randomly
divided into four groups. Group A (denoted as I/R (Control)): rats
received a 50-min 3VO. Group B (I/R+MBs/FUS): a 50-min
3VO, and then received twice MBs/FUS at 5 h after reperfusion.
Group C (I/R+hEPO): a 50-min 3VO, and then received hEPO
alone at 5 h after reperfusion. Group D (I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS):
a 50-min 3VO, and then received hEPO plus MBs/FUS at 5 h
after reperfusion. The flowchart was displayed in Fig. 1B. Third,
to evaluate the chronic response, rats were randomly divided into
four groups: Group A (denoted as sham control), Group B (I/R),
Group C (I/R+hEPO), and Group D (I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS).
The investigation of long-term response included: cylinder test and
automated gait analysis. The time courses were shown in Fig. 1C.

Materials and Methods
All the experimental protocols were approved by Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees of Medical College, National
Taiwan University.

Three Vessels Occlusion (3VO) Model
Male Wistar rats (230 to 250 g) were used in this study. The
available data suggest that the 3VO model provides more
consistent cortical injury compared to the MCAO model [21].
In this study, we employed the 3VO model to form a focal cortical
infarction, and this kind of infarction is more suitable for the
evaluation of the BBB opening with microbubbles/focused

percentage of impaired forelimb was expressed as contacts of
impaired forelimb divided by total contacts. The theoretical value
was 50% for the sham group. Animals were subjected to gait
measurement every week for one month after I/R utilizing
CatWalk-automated gait analysis system (Noldus Information
Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands)[25,26]. For gait
assessment, the animals were subjected to three consecutive runs.
After identifying each footprint, the images were converted into
digital signals and stroke-related gait data were generated
including intensity of paws (pressure) and angle of the paw axis
relative to the body axis (inward angles expressed as minus;
outward angles as plus).

Focused Ultrasound (FUS) Sonication
A 480 KHz FUS transducer with a diameter of 10 cm, 10 cm
radius of curvature was used. The acoustic beam was transmitted
to the brain directly by a removable cone replete with degassed
water. The FUS was precisely targeted using a stereotaxic
apparatus (Stoelting, Wood Dale, IL) and the center of the focal
spot was about 1 mm below the cone tip. The FUS transducer was
driven by a power amplifier (500-012, Advanced Surgical Systems,
Tucson, AZ) connected to a function generator (33220A, Agilent,
Palo Alto, CA). The rats were laid prone beneath the cone tip, and
ultrasound transmission gel (Pharmaceutical Innovations, Newark,
NJ) was used to maximize the transmission of ultrasound to the
brain. The focal zone is 3 mm and 13 mm in diameter and length,
respectively. Pulsed sonication was applied with a peak negative
pressure of 0.57 MPa, a burst length of 10 ms, a duty cycle of 1%,
and a repetition frequency of 1 Hz. The duration of each
sonication was 20 s. MBs (microbubbles) (SonoVue, Bracco,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was injected as a bolus (10 ml/kg)
about 15 s before each sonication. The FUS was delivered at two
locations with 2 mm apart in the right hemisphere cortex: 4 mm
lateral to the bregma and 1 mm or 3 mm posterior to the bregma,
respectively, and both 1 mm below the skull surface (Fig. 1C).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining was obtained both 24 h and 28
days after 3VO. The rats were perfused with saline and then fixed
with phosphate buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The
brain was removed, post-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4uC
overnight, and then stored in a 30% sucrose solution at 4uC for
two days. Brain tissue slices (30 mm thick) were pretreated with 3%
hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous peroxidase activity before
incubation of primary antibody. After blocking in 4% non-fat milk
containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h, brain tissue slices were
incubated overnight at 4uC with the following primary antibody:
NeuN (1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA), CD-11b (1:500; AbD
Serotec, Oxford, UK), and GFAP (1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA)
in PBS. After a brief wash, brain tissue slices were then incubated
with horse anti-mouse biotinylated secondary antibodies, and
processed with avidin-biotin complex system (ABC kit; Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), which was visualized by incubating with 0.5% diaminobenzidine and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in
PBS. Finally, the brain tissue slices were washed in PBS and
mounted on slides. Usually microglia activation reaches the peak
at ,72 h after ischemia, and some reports demonstrated that
microglia activation may appear as early as 24 h after ischemia
[27,28]. In this study, we like to display the delivery of hEPO into
the sonicated brain tissue and to see its resulting effect as early as
possible, and hence we performed the difference between I/R and
I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS groups at 24 hr after ischemia. For
detecting Nissl body in the cytoplasm of neurons, the brain was
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and then
was sectioned. The brain sections were sequentially conducted
with the following steps: deparaffinized in xylene for 10 min,
hydrated in 100% ethanol for 10 min, in 95% ethanol for 5 min,
in 70% ethanol for 5 min, rinsed in water for 2 min, stained in a
0.1% cresyl violet solution for 20 min, and then rinsed in water.
After dehydration with ethanol, sections were mounted with
xylene-based mounting solution.

Quantification of hEPO Entering the Brain Tissue
CSF sample was obtained at 3 h after the execution of
hEPO+MBs/FUS or hEPO alone. The rats were then perfused
with saline and decapitated, and the brain was removed and sliced
into six coronal sections. The sonicated region of each section was
dissected and the quantity of hEPO in the sonicated brain tissue
was measured by ELISA method using Quantikine human
erythropoietin kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), which did
not cross-react with rat EPO

Infarct Volume and Residual Brain Volume Evaluation
The infarct volume was analyzed 24 h after ischemia. Six
consecutive coronal sections with 2 mm thick each were sliced
from the frontal tip with the aid of a rat brain matrix and
immersed in a 2% solution of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC). The stained brain sections were then fixed by immersion in
phosphate-buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Section images were analyzed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD) to calculate the infarct volume. The residual brain
volume was analyzed one month after I/R. The brains were
removed and sliced into six consecutive coronal sections with
2 mm thick. Section images were analyzed with ImageJ to
calculate the residual brain volume.

Behavioral Evaluation
Statistical Analysis

The neurological status of the rats was evaluated 24 h after
ischemia. Neurological score was based on Menzies behavioral
function [23]. Score from 0 to 4 represents the extent of damage
from normality to severity. Score 0: rats can extend both forelimbs;
score 1: the contralateral forelimb is consistently flexed during
suspension; score 2: decreased grip of the contralateral forelimb
when pulled by the tail; score 3: rats show a mono-directional
circling at a slight jerk of the tail; and score 4: a consistent circling
occurs. One author (H.-C. Liou) blind to the treatment condition
performed the neurological evaluation. To quantify the asymmetric forelimb use for the stroke animals, the cylinder test was
performed on Day-3, Day-7, Day-14, Day-21, and Day-28 after I/
R. The animals were placed in a 20-cm-diameter cylinder with
transparent glass and at least 25 contacts of the forelimbs on the
wall of the cylinder were recorded for each rat[24]. The contact

Values are expressed as mean 6 S.E.M. The results were
analyzed with one-way ANOVA with post hoc test. Statistical
significance was defined as p,0.05.

Results
Amount of hEPO Delivered into Brain and CSF by
MBs/FUS
To study the quantity of hEPO delivered into brain, hEPO was
intravenously injected first and then MBs/FUS were applied twice
at a 15 min interval on the right cortex (Fig. 1D). The hEPO levels
in the brain sections were measured at 3 h after hEPO injection. It
was found that hEPO levels in sections 3 and 4 of the cortex were
significantly higher in the hEPO+MBs/FUS group (n = 3) than in

at 3 h after hEPO injection. The hEPO concentration of CSF in the I/
R+hEPO+MBs/FUS group showed significant enhancement compared
with the I/R+hEPO group. (C) The serum hEPO was also sampled at 3 h
after hEPO injection. No hEPO was found in the sham and I/R groups
without hEPO injection.

the hEPO group (n = 3) (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that
sonication with microbubbles increased the entry of hEPO
through the BBB. The hEPO concentration of CSF in the I/
R+hEPO+MBs/FUS group showed a significant enhancement
compared with the I/R+hEPO group (Fig. 2B). The serum hEPO
was also sampled at 3 h after hEPO injection, and the results
showed that both groups had quite high levels of hEPO. No hEPO
was found in both the sham and I/R groups indicated that hEPO
ELISA kit did not cross-react with rat EPO.

Reduction of Infarct Volume by hEPO+MBs/FUS
Rats were induced cerebral infarct by 3VO for 50 min, followed
by reperfusion. The infarction was demonstrated by TTC staining
with white color in infarct area and red color in non-infarct area
(Fig. 3A). The ratio of infarct volume was presented as percentage
of contralateral side of cortex. The infarct region was 59.566.62%
(n = 7), 66.1667.05% (n = 6), 58.6262.93% (n = 5), and
26.8764.92% (n = 5) in the I/R, I/R+MBs/FUS, I/R+hEPO,
and I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS groups, respectively. The I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS group displayed a significant reduction of infarct
volume, as compared with the I/R and I/R+hEPO groups
(p,0.05, Fig. 3B). No significant difference was observed among
the I/R, I/R+MBs/FUS, and I/R+hEPO groups. These results
indicate that the enhancement of hEPO entry into ischemic area
by MBs/FUS exerted neuroprotection against I/R-induced
neuronal injury.

Improvement of Neurological Behavior
The neurological scores were evaluated at 24 h after brain I/R.
It was found that treatment with hEPO+MBs/FUS significantly
improved neurological function (p,0.05, Fig. 3C), while treatment
with hEPO or MBs/FUS individually did not show any significant
difference as compared with the I/R group.

Neuroprotective Effect of hEPO+MBs/FUS
All the brain slice samples for immunohistochemical staining
were obtained 24 h after 3VO and the representative slices were
shown in Fig. 4. The neuronal nuclear (NeuN) staining was used to
recognize neuronal nuclei in the brain. Fig. 4E showed the marked
reduction of neuronal nuclei in the I/R group. On the contrary,
the sham and the I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS group displayed an
intact presence of neuronal nuclei (Fig. 4, B and H). It has been
reported that microglia activation occurs following neuronal
death. Neuroinflammation was thus evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for CD-11b. CD-11b positive cells with large cell
bodies were observed throughout the I/R group (Fig. 4F). In
contrast, the I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS group showed more homogenous distribution of cells with long fine processes extending from
small cell bodies (Fig. 4I). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
recognized astrocytes which were also activated in stroke. Fig. 3G
showed that the expression of GFAP was increased in the I/R
group, whereas the astroglia activation was less in the I/
R+hEPO+MBs/FUS group (Fig. 4J).

Increase of Residual Brain Volume by hEPO+MBs/FUS in
Chronic Phase
To further study the effect of hEPO+MBs/FUS against the I/
R-induced brain injury, we examined whether this treatment
exerted a long-term protection. After I/R operation, the cortex
volume of rat brain may gradually shrink as time goes by.
Representative Nissl staining showed a drastic loss of cortex tissue
in the I/R, I/R+hEPO, and I/R+MBs/FUS groups, whereas the
group treated with hEPO+MBs/FUS displayed a rather intact
cortex (Fig. 5A). The residual brain volume was presented as the
percentage of contralateral side of cortex, and the value was
99.6760.18% (n = 5), 60.6265.53% (n = 5), 59.0169.03% (n = 5),
64.4164.29% (n = 5) and 85.9765.85% (n = 5) for the sham, I/R,
I/R+hEPO, I/R+MBs/FUS, and I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS groups,
respectively. The I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS group displayed a
significant increase of residual brain volume as compared with
the I/R, I/R+hEPO, and I/R+MBs/FUS groups (p,0.05,
Fig. 5B).

Immunohistochemical staining of NeuN, CD-11b, and GFAP was
performed 24 h after I/R. (A) illustrated the position of FUS sonication.
In NeuN staining (B, E, and H), the I/R group showed a marked loss of
neurons, whereas, neurons were intact in the sham and I/R+hEPO+MBs/
FUS groups. In CD-11b staining (C, F, and I), the I/R group showed
microglia activation (condensed nuclei), whereas the sham and I/
R+hEPO+MBs/FUS groups showed ramified microglia. In GFAP staining
(D, G, and J), there was an increase of GFAP in the I/R group but not in
the sham and I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS groups. (Scale bar = 200 mm).

Improvement of Asymmetric Limb-Use and Recovery of
Gait Deficits by hEPO+MBs/FUS in Chronic Phase
One month after 3VO, the behavioral tests were performed to
examine the deficit of limb and there were no animals dead due to
the 3VO surgery. A general linear model (GLM) with repeated
measure procedure and Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used
and the results showed that usage of the contralateral forepaw
differed significantly among the treatment groups (F(3, 16)

injury beyond the conventional therapeutic time window. We
investigated the amount of hEPO delivered into the sonicated
brain tissues and the effectiveness in neuroprotection.
Focused ultrasound sonication with microbubbles could effectively boost the vascular permeability and then extend the
therapeutic time window of EPO as well as its neuroprotective
effects in both acute and chronic phases after I/R injury. In the
acute phase, the total sonication volume was smaller than the size
of infarction and hence the enhancement of hEPO delivery was
only beneficial to part of the infarcted brain. As shown in Fig. 2A,
the concentrations of hEPO in sections 3 and 4 (the sonicated
region) were significantly higher, and the TTC staining showed
that the infarct volume was reduced over 50% as compared with
the control or I/R+hEPO groups (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, in the
chronic phase, both limb-use asymmetry and dynamic gait test for
the evaluation of the chronic behavioral recovery showed that
there was a significant improvement for the hEPO+MBs/FUS
treatment. The chronic loss of brain cortex was reduced by the
hEPO+MBs/FUS treatment (Fig. 5A). These results indicated that
MBs/FUS enhanced the hEPO entry even 5 h after I/R, which
resulted in neuron protection in both acute and chronic phases.
Although stroke itself might alter hEPO delivery, the amount of
hEPO entering the infarction area did not produce significant
therapeutic effect. As hEPO combined with MBs/FUS, it can
result in a significant neuroprotection on both acute and chronic
phases.
It has been demonstrated that intracerebraventricular administration of hEPO inhibits the I/R-induced brain injury [30–32].
However, direct injection of hEPO into the brain is not a practical

= 23.602, p,0.001). Post hoc tests using the Tukey’s HSD
precedure revealed that the usage of the contralateral forepaws in
the IR+hEPO+MBs/FUS group was significantly reduced when
compared with the I/R group (Fig. 5C, p,0.05). The differences
between the I/R+hEPO+MBs/FUS group and the I/R group
during all the examining days were statistically significant
(Dunnet’s test, p,0.05 for all). Dynamic gait information was
also assessed via an automated gait analysis system. In the pawintensity measurement, the intensity of the left forepaw in the I/R
group was significantly decreased from Day-7 to Day-28 as
compared with the sham group (Fig. 6A), while in the I/
R+hEPO+MBs/FUS group, the paw intensity significantly recovered from Day-14 to Day-28 (p,0.05). The measurement of the
left-paw angle indicated that the left-paw axis was more inward in
the I/R group than in the sham group (p,0.05, Fig. 6B).
Treatment with hEPO+MBs/FUS had a significant recovery in
the long-term response.

Discussion
Drug treatment for brain diseases is usually hampered by the
BBB, which prevents the therapeutic agents from entering the
target brain tissues. Cerebral ischemia can induce BBB disruption
and permit macromolecular drug to transport into the infarcted
brain tissues. However, the therapeutic time window is short, and
beyond this window, the efficacy of treatment is limited due to
inability to achieve a sufficiently high dose of drug in the infarcted
region[29]. In this study, we employed MBs/FUS to transiently
open the BBB to extend the hEPO treatment for the I/R brain

Delivery of hEPO by MBs/FUS for Neuroprotection

Figure 6. Improvement in catwalk automated gait analysis test by hEPO plus MBs/FUS in chronic phase of 3VO. Two gait analysis
parameters, paw intensity (A) and paw angle (B), were assessed from Day-7 to Day-28 after I/R. In both paw intensity and paw angle, treatment with
hEPO+MBs/FUS significantly improved the performance of impaired limb. Data were shown as mean 6 SEM (n = 5 for each group), * p,0.05 as
compared with the sham (control group), # p,0.05 as compared with the I/R group.

approach to have an appropriate hEPO distribution in the entire
infarcted region. In the meanwhile, this kind of interstitial method
can result in severe hemorrhages and brain trauma. On the
contrary, systemic delivery of hEPO can have a much more
uniform distribution of hEPO in the infarcted volume but may be
limited by the therapeutic time window. In this study, transcranial,
noninvasive FUS technology was demonstrated to be a useful
modality to transiently open the localized BBB for the targeted
delivery of neuroprotectant to treat the ischemic stroke-induced
brain injury beyond the conventional therapeutic time window.
Brines et al. reported that animals receiving hEPO ,3 h after
occlusion (equal to 2 h after reperfusion) showed significant
reduction of necrosis volume compared with controls [33].
Animals receiving hEPO 6 h after occlusion (equal to 5 h after
reperfusion) exhibited a significant decrease in injury volume, but
the effect was substantially smaller compared with animals
receiving hEPO earlier. Gan et al. reported that EPO exerted
significantly neuroprotective effects when administered up to 4 h
after I/R in MCAO model, but the effects were significantly
diminished and lost when administered 6 h after I/R [34]. In our
study, we employed 3VO for 50 min and injected EPO at 5 h
after reperfusion and the result showed that there was no
significant neuroprotection. These might be due to different stroke
models with various occlusion and ischemic duration would
produce different levels of impact on the brain.
EPO-TAT administered at the onset of post-stroke reperfusion
[35] showed the ability across the BBB for neuroprotection.
Derivatives of EPO such as CEPO had the neuroprotection ability
only within 4 h after occlusion, which is equal to 3 h after
reperfusion, in a rat model of focal ischemia [36]. BBB is more
permeable for these EPO derivatives within 3 h after reperfusion
due to leaky vascularity. Mutant EPO exerted neuroprotective
effects up to 4 h after reperfusion but gradually lose its efficacy as
time went by [34]. However, the neuroprotective effects were
diminished and lost when the mutant EPO was administered 6 h
after reperfusion. Ischemia is an acute pathological process and
cells die rapidly within first several hours after ischemia.
Therefore, neuroprotective drugs must be delivered within their
therapeutic window. In this study, we demonstrated that MBs/

FUS had the ability to enhance EPO into the brain at 5 h after
reperfusion (,6 h after the onset of occlusion). MBs/FUS can
open the intact BBB and extend the therapeutic time window of
EPO.
The parameters used in this study are based on our previous
work [14], which is able to minimize the brain tissue damage.
Ultrasound pressure would have caused the microbubbles in the
acoustic beam oscillation and even cavitation during sonication
[37,38]. These oscillation and cavitation may open vascular walls
to enhance hEPO transport into brain tissues. However, the above
phenomena may produce some small hemorrhages for the brain
tissue in the focal zone, which might cause some damage. To
achieve effective drug delivery and minimize this side-effect, we
can control acoustic pressure, duty cycle, sonication time, MB
dose, etc.
For clinical patient treatments, FUS transducers should be
combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system and
thus the MR imaging can be used to guide the FUS transducer to
have a precision sonication and to monitor the treatment response.
Recently, it has been shown the feasibility of using MRI-guided
FUS with MBs to noninvasively open the localized BBB on nonhuman primates [39,40]. In this preliminary study, the neuroprotective agent was used only one dose and one time. It requires
further scrutiny and examination for the combination of FUS
sonication with multiple treatments of neuroprotectants.
MBs/FUS can transcranially and transiently open the localized
BBB for the transport of macromolecular drug into the desired
brain region. In this study, we utilized this modality for the
localized delivery of neuroprotective agent into the infarcted brain
of rats beyond the conventional therapeutic time window. The
results of acute and chronic investigation show that this modality
can provide an alternative treatment option to deliver neuroprotectants or drugs to the injured brain.
