Abstract In the present study, we aimed at evaluating the
potential neuroprotective effect and the underlying mechanism
of anemonin against cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R)
injury. Anemonin was administered to rats by the intraperitoneally (i.p.) route once daily for 7 days before middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO). Focal cerebral ischemia was induced
by 90 min of MCAO followed by 24 h of reperfusion. After that,
animals were sacrificed by decapitation, brain was removed, and
various biochemical estimations, neurological status, and assessment of cerebral infarct size were carried out. MCAO followed
by 24 h of reperfusion caused a significant increase in infarct
size, neurological deficit score, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and DNA fragmentation, as well as a decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and Na+, K+-ATPase in the brain.
Furthermore, elevated Bax expression, increased caspase-3
cleavage, and decreased Bcl-2 expression were observed in
nontreated rats in response to focal cerebral I/R injury.
However, pretreatment with anemonin significantly reversed
these levels of biochemical parameters, reduced cerebral infarct
size, and improved the neurologic score in cerebral ischemic
animals. Additionally, a wide distribution of anemonin in plasma

and brain tissues and the brain-to-plasma partition coefficient
(Ri) ratio of 0.7 at 90 min indicated that this compound could
penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These results showed
that pretreatment with anemonin provided a significant protection against cerebral I/R injury in rats by, at least in part, its
antioxidant action and consequent inhibition of apoptosis.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a serious human health risk, and reperfusion
plays an important role in cerebral ischemic injury. Ischemic
stroke occurs when the normal blood supply to the brain is
disrupted, usually due to artery blockage by a blood clot, thereby
resulting in the activation of a series of functional impairment that
eventually leads to neuronal death (Dirnagl et al. 1999).
Although reperfusion of ischemic brain tissue is critical for
restoring normal function, paradoxically there is a burst of free
radical generation at the onset of reperfusion after cerebral ischemia (Dirnagl et al. 1995). A growing body of research has
reported that a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is produced during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R), which
leads to the oxidation of lipids, proteins, and DNA and subsequently cellular damage and apoptosis (Wong and Crack 2008;
Janardhan and Qureshi 2004; Chan 2001). Particularly, neurons
are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and contain low levels of
endogenous antioxidants (Coyle and Puttfarcken 1993; Juurlink
and Sweeney 1997); consequently, the brain is very much susceptible to the damage due to ROS. Several reactive oxygen
species, such as superoxide, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite radical, etc., that are generated after ischemia
and reperfusion injury play an important role in neuronal injury

(Imaizumi et al. 1984; Oliver et al. 1990a). Therefore, much
attention has been paid to the rescue of cerebral injury after I/R
via inhibition of ROS bursts and the use of antioxidants, free
radical scavengers, or trapping agents to inhibit free radical
formation or lipid peroxidation would be rational in preventing
the progression of neuronal damage during I/R injury. Recently,
there is overwhelming attention to natural agents and synthetic
products that can limit free radical mediated injuries, for better
therapeutic management of I/R injury. In fact, many effective
components extracted from traditional herbs and synthetic antioxidants have been demonstrated to show neuroprotection
against I/R-induced cerebral injury in experimental studies
(Easton et al. 1998; Yousuf et al. 2009; Itoh et al. 1990).
However, effective medical and biological measures for the
treatment of the disorder in clinical practice are not well
established (Dietschy and Turley 2001). Along with further
studies on cerebral I/R injury, discovering effective agents for
the prevention and treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular disease
has become urgent.
Anemonin (the dilactone of cyclobutane-1,2-diol-1,2diacrylic acid) (Fig. 1) has been isolated from Pulsatilla
chinensis, Drymaria diandra, Knowltonia capensis, Clematis
chinensis, and Ranunculaceous plants (Huang et al. 2008).
Recently, it has been reported that anemonin possesses antiinflammatory (Duan et al. 2006), antibacterial, antiviral, antitoxic, and cytopathogenic properties (Toshkov et al. 1961),
but so far, its effect on I/R-induced injury in rat brain has not
yet been reported. We therefore set out to investigate the
neuroprotective potential of anemonin and its mechanisms in
the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced focal
cerebral I/R model in rats.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Male Wistar rats weighing 250–300 g were housed in polypropylene cages under standard environmental conditions and fed

with standard rodent diet and tap water ad libitum. Animals were
acclimatized for 1 week before the experiments under a controlled light/dark cycle. All experimental procedures performed
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of The Fourth Military Medical University.
Treatment Schedule
The animals were divided into four groups, each having 10
animals: the first group served as the sham control; the second
was the vehicle-treated MCAO group, i.e., ischemia was
induced for 2 h followed by 24 h of reperfusion; the third
was pretreated with anemonin (150 mg/kg) 7 days before the
induction of MCAO, i.e., MCAO +anemonin group. The
sham group and control group were given the same volume
of intranasal saline. The anemonin group received anemonin
treatment by intraperitoneally (i.p.) route once a day, for 7 days
prior to ischemia. On day 7, 1 h after the above treatment, the
rats were subjected to the following evaluation tests.
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Focal cerebral I/R was induced by occlusion of the MCAO on
the left side according to previously described methods (Hua
et al. 2009) with little modification. Briefly, after mice were
anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg, i.p.), the right
common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA),
and external carotid artery (ECA) were carefully exposed and
dissected away from adjacent nerves under an operating microscope. The ECA was then isolated and ligated. A 4-0-nylon
monofilament, the tip of which was rounded with the use of an
open flame, was inserted into the ICA through the ECA stump
for approximately 17–20 mm past the carotid bifurcation until
a slight resistance was felt, to occlude the middle cerebral
artery (MCA). Ninety minutes after MCAO, the suture was
slowly withdrawn. The animals were then returned to their
prewarmed cages for 24 h. During the surgical procedure, the
rectal temperature was maintained at 37±0.5 °C using a
heating plate. In sham-operated rats, the external carotid artery
was surgically prepared for insertion of the filament, but the
filament was not inserted.

Twenty-four hours after I/R, the rats were assessed for
neurological deficits, which are based on the method of
Longa et al. (Longa et al. 1989) as follows: no neurological
deficit=0; failure to extend right paw fully=1; circling to
right=2; falling to right=3; did not walk spontaneously and
had depressed levels of consciousness=4. The higher the
score was, the higher was the ischemic insult. The observer
had no knowledge of which treatment had been administered. The above procedures were performed in a blinded

J Mol Neurosci (2014) 53:271–279

manner. Results are means±SD of three separate experiments performed in triplicate.
Cerebral Infarct Volume Assessment
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the rats were deeply
anesthetized with chloral hydrate and decapitated, and the
brains were quickly removed and stored at 48 °C. Frozen
brain was sliced into about 2-mm-thick coronal sections.
The slices were stained in 1 % triphenyl tetrazolium chloride
(TTC) saline solution at 37 °C in the dark for 20 min, followed
by 10 % formalin fixation overnight according to the method
of (Kuang et al. 2006). TTC is converted to red formazone
pigment by NAD and dehydrogenase present in living cells.
Hence, viable cells were stained deep red. The infracted cells
had lost the enzyme and thus remained unstained dull yellow.
Photographs of coronal sections were analyzed by Photoshop
6.0 image analyzer. The infarct areas were expressed as a
percentage of the whole area (%).
Tissue Preparation
To determine oxidative product contents, antioxidant enzyme activities and the stored brains were homogenized
with 10 times (10 %, w/v) ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer
(0.02 M, pH 7.2) in a homogenizer and centrifuged at
123×g at 4 °C for 3 min. The supernatant containing crude
membranes was used for the estimation of Na+, K+-ATPase
and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. The remaining supernatant was again centrifuged at 12,000×g for 15 min at
4 °C. The post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) was used
for the study of various antioxidant enzyme activities and
was kept at −10 °C until assayed.
MDA Content
MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, was estimated by the
method of (Okhawa et al. 1979) and expressed as nanomoles
per gram of wet tissue.

273

Measurement of Reduced Glutathione Activity
The glutathione (GSH) content, determined by the method of
(Jollow et al. 1974), was calculated as micromoles per gram of
wet tissue.
Measurement of Glutathione Peroxidase Activity
Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, measured by using the
method of (Mohandas et al. 1984), was defined as nanomoles
of NADPH oxidized per minute per milligram of protein using
a molar extinction coefficient of 6.21×103 M−1 cm−1.
Total Protein
The total protein contents of brain homogenates were determined by using the modified method of (Lowry et al. 1951).
Measurement of Na+, K+-ATPase Activity
Na+, K+-ATPase activity in the mitochondria determined as
inorganic phosphorus (Pi) release using the method of
(Sovoboda and Mossinger 1981) was defined as micromoles
of Pi formed per hour per milligram of protein.
Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species in Brain
Mitochondria
ROS production in mouse brain mitochondria was monitored
by using the membrane-permeable fluorescent probe 2′,7′dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) (LeBel et al.
1992). Mitochondria isolated from different groups were incubated with DCFH-DA (20 μM) at 37 °C for 30 min, and the
fluorescence intensity of the oxidized fluorescent derivative
dichlorofluorescein (DCF) was monitored at excitation and
emission wavelengths of 488 and 525 nm, respectively, using
a fluorescence spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M2,
Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). All procedures
were performed in the dark. The results from the normal group
were taken as the 100 % DCF level. ROS level was expressed
as percentage in fluorescence relative to the normal group.

Measurement of Superoxide Dismutase Activity
Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured according to a previously described procedure by (Beauchamp and
Fridovich 1971) and was expressed as nanomoles of formazan
formed per minute per milligram of protein.
Measurement of Catalase Activity
Catalase (CAT) activity, determined by the method of
(Claiborne 1985), was defined as nanomoles of H2O2 consumed per minute per milligram of protein.

Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP Nick End
Labeling Assay
Apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay by means
of the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN,
USA) according to the instruction of the manufacturer. The
slides were observed by a confocal scanning laser microscope.
The apoptotic index was the number of labeled apoptotic
bodies expressed as the percentage of the total number of
nuclei. Five fields were examined for each animal.

J Mol Neurosci (2014) 53:271–279

The Western blot analysis was carried out following the standard method (Harlow and Lane 1988). The homogenate of rat
brain equivalent to 30 μg of total protein samples was resolved on 10 % SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins
were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane and
blocked with 5 % BSA. The membrane was then probed with
the primary rabbit anti-caspase-3 (1:400 dilution; cleaved
caspase-3 antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., USA),
mouse anti-Bcl-2 (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.,
USA), and rabbit anti-Bax antibodies (1:500, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc., USA). After washing, the membrane
was incubated with the secondary horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at room
temperature for 60 min. The protein band of interest was
visualized using an ECL chemiluminescene system (ECL
plus; Amersham Biosciences, NJ, USA). Immunoblotting
for β-actin (Lanji Biotechnology, Inc., Shanghai, China,
1:2,000) was performed as an internal control.
Brain Distribution of Anemonin in Rats
Male Wistar rats were given anemonin at dose of 150 mg/kg
via i.p. administration. A destructive sampling was conducted
on groups of five animals that were subjected to CO2 asphyxiation at 30, 90, and 240 min after anemonin treatment. Blood
was collected by heart puncture using heparinized syringes
and centrifuged at 5,000×g for 8 min at 4 °C to yield plasma
for analysis. Brain tissues were immediately removed, homogenized in PBS (1:1w/v), and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm
for 15 min as described above (Yu et al. 2007). The concentration of anemonin in plasma and tissues was determined by
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis.
As a measure of brain penetration potential, the brain-toplasma partition coefficient (Ri) was calculated as follows:
Ri ¼ AUC0–inf

ðbrainÞ =AUC0–inf ðplasmaÞ

where AUC0–inf (brain) and AUC0–inf (plasma) are the areas under
the brain and plasma concentrations versus time curves,
respectively.

24 h produced a significant increase in cerebral infarct volume
(P<0.01) as compared to the sham group. Pretreatment with
anemonin 7 days before MCAO markedly attenuated I/R-induced increase in cerebral infarct volume (P<0.01) as compared
to the MCAO group. This suggested that anemonin exhibited a
protective effect against I/R-induced cerebral injury.

The effects of anemonin on brain MDA content, SOD, CAT,
GSH, and GPx activities in rats subjected to cerebral I/R injury
are shown in Table 1. MDA formation is widely used as one of
the most sensitive indicators of lipid peroxidation (Gutteridge
1995). MDA concentration in rat ischemic brain was significantly elevated (P<0.01) due to focal ischemia and 24 h of
reperfusion injury as compared to the sham group. Anemonin
pretreatment markedly decreased the elevated MDA concentration in the brain compared with the ischemic control group
(P<0.01). Cerebral I/R led to a significant decrease of SOD,
CAT, GSH, and GPx activities in the MCAO-induced control
group versus the respective sham group (P<0.01). When
compared with the MACO group, pretreatment with
anemonin greatly elevated these antioxidant enzyme activities
in the animals subjected to MCAO and reperfusion (P<0.01).

resulted in a significant neurological deficit with failure to

the model group (P<0.05, Fig. 2).

in the vehicle group was much higher compared with the sham

tible to free radical reaction and lipid peroxidation because it is
embedded in the cell membrane and requires phospholipids
for maintenance of its activity (Cooper et al. 1980; Furui et al.
1990). This enzyme activity has been used as a potential
indicator of membrane structure and function (Engelke et al.
1992). In present study, the Na+, K+-ATPase activity decreased significantly in rat ischemic brain due to focal ischemia and 24 h reperfusion injury as compared with shamoperated animals (P<0.001). Pretreatment with anemonin
7 days before the induction of ischemia markedly attenuated
I/R-induced decrease in the Na+, K+-ATPase activity as compared with the MCAO group, and these attenuations were
significant (P<0.001) (Fig. 4).
Effect of Anemonin on the Level of ROS in Brain
Mitochondria
Oxidative stress plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of cerebral
injury after I/R. The elevated generation of ROS could trigger
the production of lipid peroxidation products such as MDA and
cytotoxic progression (Iadecola et al. 1996; Kuroda and Siesjö
1997). To elucidate the neuroprotective characteristics, the
fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein was used to

Effect of Anemonin on Brain Neuron Death
and Apoptosis-Related Proteins
To further specify the effect of pretreatment with anemonin on
the damage of brain neurons after I/R, apoptotic cells were
recognized by identification of DNA fragmentation using the
TUNEL method. Quantitative analysis displayed in Fig. 6 revealed that brains of sham-operated rats were almost negative
for DNA fragmentation. A large number of TUNEL-positive
cells occurred in the vehicle-treated MCAO group (P<0.001 as
compared with sham-operated controls). However, the I/Revoked increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells was
significantly reduced in the anemonin-treated groups (P<0.001
as compared with the vehicle-pretreated ischemic control).
These results suggested that anemonin effectively prevented
the expansion of apoptotic neuronal death in MCAO-induced
cereal I/R rats.
In line with the results of TUNEL assay, Western blot
analysis (Fig. 7) showed a significant increase of Bax and
cleaved caspase-3, together with a noticeable decrease of Bcl2 in rats subjected to I/R challenge when compared with the
sham group. Pretreatment with anemonin prior to performance of I/R significantly mitigated these changes, resulting
in increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased expression of
Bax and cleaved caspase-3. It was therefore proposed that
inhibition of the mitochondrial-dependent activation of
caspase-3 through decreased Bax and increased Bcl-2 expression constituted one mechanism whereby anemonin exerted
its anti-apoptotic actions in rat brain.
Brain Distribution of Anemonin in Rats
To further study the in vivo brain distribution of anemonin, the
level of anemonin was determined in plasma and the brain up
to 240 min (4 h) after treatment with a single dose of
150 mg/kg of anemonin to rats (Table 2). Anemonin treatment

plasma and the brain of the rat. Especially, the Ri reached a
maximum value of 0.7 at the period of 90 min, indicating its
permeation into the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Conclusions
The present study was designed for the first time to evaluate
the potential neuroprotective effects of anemonin on focal I/R
insult as well as behavioral disturbances induced by cerebral
I/R injury in rats. MCAO induced by thread insertion is used
as a widely accepted animal model of I/R in patients with
cerebral infarction. Using this model, pretreatment with
anemonin can induce neuroprotection by reducing cerebral
infarct size and improving neurologic function in a focal rat
MCAO model after 90 min of ischemia followed by 24 h of
reperfusion, indicating that this natural product possesses the
capacity to protect mouse brain from I/R injury.
Over the last decade, important advances have been made
to support the fact that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
generated and play a harmful role during cerebral I/R induced
neuronal injury (Gilgun-Sherki et al. 2002; Globus et al.
1995). During I/R injury, excessively generated ROS induced
by I/R cannot be efficiently removed by the endogenous
antioxidant systems, and the accumulation of ROS could
cause oxidative damage to brain lipids, proteins, and nucleic
acids, leading to brain dysfunction and cell death (Braughler
and Hall 1989; Oliver et al. 1990b). Therefore, the beneficial
effects of various radical scavengers and antioxidants in ischemic stroke have been demonstrated in a number of studies
(Saleem et al. 2006; Zhan and Yang 2006; Yousuf et al. 2005).
ROS produces malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of
lipid peroxidation (Halliwell and Gutteridge 1984), which
results in the alteration in permeability and fluidity of the
membrane (Mead 1976). The impairment in membrane permeability due to lipid peroxidation and attenuation of antioxidant enzyme activities would lead to the inhibition of Na+,

K+-ATPase (Reed 1990; He et al. 2010), thus resulting in a
decline of Na+ and K+ electrochemical gradients and cell
death as a result of osmotic damage (Blaustein 1977).
Furthermore, the brain itself also possesses a series of antioxidant defense enzymes including SOD, CAT, GSH, and GPx
to prevent injury induced by cerebral I/R. Therefore, in the
present study, MDA and ROS levels, as well as SOD, CAT,
GSH, and GPx activities, were estimated in rat brain tissues
after I/R injury. Our result showed that there were a significant
increase in the level of MDA and ROS and a decrease in
antioxidant enzyme and Na+, K+-ATPase activities in the rat
brain tissues after I/R injury. However, pretreatment with
anemonin significantly attenuated the increased brain MDA
and ROS level as well as restored the activities of SOD, CAT,
GSH, GPx, and Na+, K+-ATPase in rat brain tissues.
Damage to neurons may occur through oxidative stress
and/or mitochondrial impairment and culminate in activation
of an apoptotic cascade. Apoptosis or related phenomena are
possibly involved in secondary cell death in cerebral ischemia.
Prevention of apoptosis becomes a therapeutic strategy to
preserve brain tissues and promote functional recovery
(Vogel et al. 2007). It was therefore thought to be worthwhile
to explore the effect of anemonin on apoptosis. It is well
known that caspases are a family of intracellular proteins
involved in the initiation and execution of cell apoptosis.
Caspase-3 is a potent, terminal caspase that executes apoptosis
via the mitochondria-dependent pathway (Bozlu et al. 2007;
Zhao et al. 2008). Recent studies of cerebral ischemia in rats
reveal that dysregulation of the Bcl-2 family of proteins can
exacerbate ischemic neuronal injury. Bax and Bcl-2, proteins
of the Bcl-2 family, serve as distinct regulators of apoptosis at
its early stages. An interaction between Bax, a pro-apoptotic
protein, and Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein, may be necessary for the apoptotic process to proceed (Merry and
Korsmeyer 1997; Chan 2004). The most novel finding of
the present report is that the neuroprotective effects of
anemonin are closely associated with reductions in the apoptotic event known to develop during cerebral cortical ischemia. In support of this proposal, it was found that brain tissue
underwent apoptosis following cerebral I/R and pretreatment
with anemonin consequently reduced cell death as observed in
the TUNEL assay. Furthermore, the decrease in the expression
of Bax and caspase-3 and concurrent increase in the expression of Bcl-2 by 7 days of pretreatment with anemonin strongly favored the notion that anemonin exerts attenuating effect
on I/R-induced neuron injury, at least in part, through interfering apoptosis pathway. In addition, a high concentration of
anemonin in both plasma and brain tissues suggested the
ability of this compound to cross the BBB. Hence, anemonin
appeared to possess the antiapoptosis ability to protect mouse
brain from I/R damage.

In conclusion, the antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties
of anemonin might be contributed to its neuroprotective potential in cerebral ischemic damage. These results suggest that
anemonin may be a promising therapeutic drug for the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.
