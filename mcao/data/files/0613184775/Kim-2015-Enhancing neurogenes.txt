In this study, we hypothesized that the delivery of molecules that regulate the microenvironment after a
cerebral infarction can inﬂuence regeneration potential after a stroke. Stromal cell-derived factor-1a
(SDF-1a) is a chemoattractant molecule that plays a pivotal role in recruiting endothelial progenitor cells
(EPCs) to the infarct region after stroke. Increased SDF-1a expression leads to increased EPCs homing at
the infarct region and induces neurogenesis, angiogenesis, neuroprotection, and stem cell homing. Thus,
we evaluated the effects of targeted delivery of SDF-1a using a pH-sensitive polymer poly (urethane
amino sulfamethazine) (PUASM), a synthetic macromolecule with potential for targeted drug delivery in
acidic conditions, to enhance therapeutic neurogenesis and angiogenesis in a rat model of permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion. A dual ionic pH-sensitive copolymer PUASM-based random copolymer
was designed and synthesized for the controlled release of SDF-1a in stroke. Owing to the unique
characteristics of PUASM, it exhibited a dual ionic pH-sensitive property in an aqueous solution. At pH 8.5,
the copolymer exhibited a negative charge and was water soluble. Interestingly, when the pH decreased
to 7.4, PUASM could form a micelle and encapsulate protein effectively via the ionic interaction between a
negatively charged polymer and a positively charged protein. At pH 5.5, the ionization of tertiary amines
led to the disassembly of the micellar structure and released the protein rapidly. Then, we investigated the
effect of systemic administration of SDF-1a-loaded pH-sensitive polymeric micelles in a stroke induced
rat model. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed increased expression of SDF-1a in the
ischemic region, indicating that the pH-sensitive micelles effectively delivered SDF-1a into the ischemic
region. In order to observe the biodistribution of SDF-1a in the ischemic region, it was labeled with the
near-infrared dye, Cy5.5. Optical imaging showed that the Cy5.5 signal increased in the infarct region 24 h
after administration. Immunohistochemistry data showed that targeted delivery of SDF-1a enhanced
neurogenesis and angiogenesis, but did not inﬂuence cell survival or inﬂammation. These observations
suggest that SDF-1a-loaded pH-sensitive polymeric micelles can be used as pH-triggered targeting agents
and can effectively modify the microenvironment to increase innate neurorestorative processes.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the leading cause of physical disability and the second
leading cause of death in adults. Recanalization therapy is the only
clinically proven method for the treatment of acute stroke, but it
has a short therapeutic time window (up to 3e6 h after stroke
onset). Numerous approaches have been developed to protect the
brain from ischemic damage but have limited success in clinical
practice [1]. As a consequence, a large proportion of stroke survivors struggle with severe disabilities. Recovery after stroke is usually limited because there is no deﬁnitive therapy that can restore
lost brain function.
The degree of recovery differs greatly among patients with
ischemic stroke, which may the result of several factors. First, the
baseline severity and infarction location determine the long-term
outcome after stroke. Second, patient proﬁles such as age, sex,
and risk factor proﬁles are also associated with the outcome after
stroke. Lastly, but of great importance, the microenvironment in an
ischemic brain differs among patients and may greatly inﬂuence
the degree to which neurological deﬁcits are restored. Our previous
results have shown that levels of chemokines and trophic factors,
and their polymorphisms inﬂuence the effects of neurorestorative
therapies in stroke patients [2,3]. Moreover, most recovery occurs
in the ﬁrst few months after the stroke, with only minor additional
measureable improvements occurring thereafter. The levels of
chemokines, trophic factors, and related miRNAs increase markedly
in the infarcted brain during the acute phase of stroke, but decrease
over time. Such changes in the brain microenvironment severely
restrict the degree of recovery and neurogenesis/angiogenesis in
stroke patients.
It was hypothesized that the delivery of molecules which regulates the microenvironment in the brain infarct can increase the
degree and duration of neurogenesis and angiogenesis after stroke.
Among the milieu of chemicals expressed in the injured microenvironment, stromal cell-derived factor-1a (SDF-1a or CXCL12a) and
its unique receptor chemokine CXC motif receptor (CXCR4) is a
candidate molecule that modulates the microenvironment in the
infarcted brain [4,5]. SDF-1a is a major chemoattractant molecule
for neural stem cells (NSCs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and is recognized as a prime
candidate in neurorestorative interventions. The treatment of
stroke with SDF-1a upregulates the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and enhances neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurological outcome [6].
However, the application of trophic factors or chemokines requires
direct injection, which severely limits their therapeutic use owing
to its systemic adverse effects and poor transport of large molecule
drugs into the brain [7].
Polymeric carriers composed of biodegradable amphiphilic
polymers have emerged as promising nanovehicles for the
controlled release of various anticancer drugs, proteins, and diagnostic agents [8e12]. In particular, the delivery of genes and proteins utilizing polymeric ionic complex micelles has been proven to
be an effective strategy because of its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-immunogenicity [13,14]. However, the ﬁne
tuning of therapeutics release at cancerous tissue or ischemia could
be effective for targeting an acidic environment. For instance, we
recently demonstrated that pH-tuning a positively charged proteinencapsulated polymeric micelle has effectively delivered a target
protein (e.g., albumin) into the infarct area [15].
Also, numerous polysaccharide-based scaffolds have been
developed for the sustained delivery of SDF-1a to improve EPCs
migration. For instance, starPEG-heparin hydrogels impregnated
with SDF-1a have been prepared to act on EPCs [16]. In addition,
several other SDF-1a incorporated hydrogel formulation, including
poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid), heparin and alginate scaffolds have

proven to enhance in vivo recruitment of hematopoietic cells and
in vivo wound healing [17e21]. Several studies have attempted to
deliver SDF-1a using hydrogel systems. However, no signiﬁcant
efforts have been directed to develop pH-responsive polymeric
micelles for the site-speciﬁc delivery of SDF-1a.
Herein, we developed a dual ionic pH-responsive copolymer
poly (urethane amino sulfamethazine) (PUASM), composed of a
cationic tertiary amine group and an anionic sulfonamide group, for
the delivery of hydrophilic SDF-1a to the ischemic region (Fig. 1).
The poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) present in the copolymer is able to
protect the nanocomplexes from proteolytic digestion and to provide stealth characteristics in vivo. The pH-responsive block,
PUASM, present in the copolymers enable encapsulation of SDF-1a
through ionic and hydrophobic interaction at physiological buffer
(pH 7.4). Polyurethane in the copolymer is slowly degraded after
expressing its roles for SDF-1a delivery. The formation of an ionic
complex between SDF-1a and PUASM copolymer was evaluated by
measuring their size and surface charge using dynamic light scattering (DLS). In addition, we examined the in vivo biodistribution
and neurorestorative ability of SDF-1a using a rat model with
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials

a,u-Bis-hydroxy poly (ethylene glycol) (HO-PEG-OH,
Mn ¼ 2000 g/mol), sulfamethazine (SM, 99.0%), diethanolamine
(DEA, 98.0%), sodium hydroxide (97.0%), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI, 98.0%), dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL), anhydrous N,Ndimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%), and anhydrous chloroform
(CHCl3, 99.8%) were purchased from SigmaeAldrich Co. (St. Louis,
MO, USA). Acryloyl chloride was purchased from Tokyo Chemical
Industries (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals were of analytical
grade and used without further puriﬁcation. Deionized (DI) water
(18.2 MU cm resistivity at 25  C) was used in the experiment.
2.2. Synthesis of dual ionic pH-sensitive copolymer
Dual ionic pH-sensitive copolymer was synthesized via a polyaddition polymerization reaction. The detailed synthetic route to
prepare the pH-sensitive copolymer is shown in Fig. 2.
2.2.1. Synthesis of acrylated sulfamethazine (SMA)
SM (1 eq) and sodium hydroxide (1.1 eq) were dissolved in a
mixture of DI water and acetone (1:1) at a 10% solids concentration
in a 250 mL one-neck round-bottom ﬂask. Thereafter, the ﬂask was
placed on an ice bath to cool the solution to 0  C. Acryloyl chloride
(1.1 eq) was added drop by drop to the solution with constant
stirring and was maintained at the same temperature for 3 h. The
resulting precipitate was ﬁltered, washed with excess DI water, and
dried for 2 days at room temperature under vacuum.
2.2.2. Synthesis of dihydroxyl amino sulfamethazine (DHASM)
SMA and DEA were placed in a 250 mL two-neck round-bottom
ﬂask at a mole ratio of 1:1, and then the reactants were dissolved in
anhydrous DMF at a 10 wt% reactant concentration. The ﬂask was
then placed in an oil bath and heated to 50  C with constant stirring
for 12 h. DMF was then evaporated and the resultant residue was
dissolved in CHCl3. The product was precipitated in excess diethyl
ether, ﬁltered and dried at room temperature under vacuum.
2.2.3. Synthesis of pH-sensitive PUASM
HO-PEG-OH (1 mmol) and DHASM (5 mmol) were dried in a
250 mL two-neck round-bottom ﬂask under vacuum at 100  C for

administration procedure of SDF-1a.

2 h to completely remove the moisture. The reactant was cooled to
room temperature under dry nitrogen, and then an anhydrous DMF
solution (90 mL) was added to the ﬂask using a glass syringe. After
the reactants have been dissolved, HDI (6 mmol) and the same
volume of DBTL was dissolved in anhydrous CHCl3 and was then
added to the reactant solution; the reaction was carried out at 60  C
for 3 h. The solution was then cooled to room temperature, and
precipitated with an excess amount of diethyl ether. The precipitated product was ﬁltered and dried at room temperature under
vacuum.

2.3. Characterization
The chemical structures of the monomer and PUASM copolymer
were characterized using 1H NMR (Unity Inova 500 NB, Varian)
operating at 500 MHz, for which the samples were dissolved in
either CDCl3 or DMSO-D6 containing 0.03 v/v% tetramethylsilane
(TMS) as an internal standard. The particle size and zeta potential of
pH-sensitive polymeric micelles (pH-PM) were determined by
Electronic Light Scattering (ELS) using a Zeta-potential & Particle
size Analyzer (ELS-Z from Photal OTSUKA Electronic, Korea) with a
helium laser at 633 nm and scattering angle maintained at 90  C.
The zeta potential values are derived from electrophoretic mobility
values using Smouluchowski equation. When the difference between the measured and calculated baselines was less than 0.1%,
the correlation function was accepted. For the measurement,
polymer solutions (2 mg/mL) with different pH levels were ﬁltered
using a syringe ﬁlter (0.45 mm, Millipore); then, the particle size and
zeta potential measurements were performed.
2.4. Preparation of lysozyme and SDF-1a-loaded micelles

Fig. 2. Synthesis scheme of (A) DHASM monomer, and (B) pH-sensitive PUASM
copolymer.

To prepare the lysozyme-loaded pH-PM (Lysozyme-pH-PM),
PUASM (100 mg) and lysozyme (1 mg) was dissolved in 10 mL of
PBS buffer (pH 9.0). Then, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4
by the addition of 1 N HCl and then the solution was incubated for
1
h.
Free
lysozyme
was
removed
using
dialysis
(MWCO ¼ 100,000 Da) against distilled water. In this study,
Lysozyme-pH-PM was prepared to observe the initial complexation
characteristics with the PUASM copolymer. For practical application, SDF-1a-loaded pH-PM (SDF-1a-pH-PM) was prepared.
For in vivo imaging, Cy5.5-labeled SDF-1a (Cy5.5-SDF-1a) was
prepared by the reaction between N-hydroxy succinimido Cy5.5
(Cy5.5-NHS) and SDF-1a. In brief, SDF-1a (1 mg) and Cy5.5-NHS
(0.1 mg) were dissolved in PBS (pH 9.0) and incubated for 1 h at
room temperature. Then, the solution was puriﬁed with a dialysis
membrane (MWCO ¼ 3500 Da) against DI water to remove
unreacted dye, followed by lyophilization to obtain Cy5.5-SDF-1a.
For the preparation of Cy5.5-SDF-1a-pH-PM or SDF-1a-pH-PM

118

(without Cy5.5 labeling), an identical procedure was followed with
Lysozyme-pH-PM.
The amount of SDF-1a present in the polymeric micelles was
determined using an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
test. Henceforth, irrespective of the sample group (SDF-1a or SDF1a-pH-PM), for all the experiment we used similar amount of SDF1a (e.g. either 100 mg/mL of SDF-1a or SDF-1a-pH-PM containing
100 mg/mL of SDF-1a).
2.5. Focal cerebral ischemia
Adult male SpragueeDawley rats (270e310 g) were supplied by
the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology
(Daejeon, Korea). All experiments with live animals were performed in compliance with the relevant laws and institutional
guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Research Center (LARC; AAALAC International-approved facility) at the Samsung Medical Center. Transient and permanent focal cerebral ischemia's were
induced by MCAO, as previously described [22]. Animals were
initially anesthetized with 5% isoﬂurane, and then maintained on
1.5% isoﬂurane in 70% N2O and 30% O2. During the surgical procedure, body temperature was maintained at 37  C using a homeothermometer. The right common carotid artery (CCA), external
carotid artery, and internal carotid artery were loosely ligated with
a 4-0 silk suture. The right MCA was occluded with a silicon-coated
nylon suture (tip diameter: 330e380 mm) from the right CCA. After
90 min, reperfusion was performed by removing the suture. In the
permanent model, the reperfusion procedure was not performed.
The sham surgery was performed with an identical procedure
without occluding the MCA. To label proliferating cells, rats were
injected intraperitoneally with 50 mg/kg of 5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdU) (Roche) once a day, from Day 1 to 6 or Day 0 to 6 after
ischemia, and were sacriﬁced on Day 7.
2.6. Intracerebral infusion of SDF-1a
24 h after transient MCAO, the rats were anesthetized with a
ketamine and xylazine (4:1) mixture and were ﬁxed in a stereotaxic
frame. The skull was exposed, and a small burr hole (1 mm) was
made using a high-speed microdrill. Recombinant human SDF-1a
(100 ng/5 ml, Cell Science, #CRS000C) or 5 ml of distilled water was
infused into the right striatum (2.5 mm lateral from the bregma,
4.6 mm in depth below the skull) using a 22-gauge Hamilton syringe needle. After removing the needle, the burr hole was ﬁlled
with bone wax. The sham operation was performed with all the
procedures except infusion.
2.7. Tissue preparation and immunoﬂuorescence staining
Seven days after MCAO, the rats were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine (4:1) and were transcardially perfused with PBS
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were harvested
and immersed in 4% PFA for 24 h, and then underwent cryoprotection in 30% sucrose in PBS, until they completely sank.
Coronal sections (10 mm) were obtained under controlled conditions at 20  C using a cryostat.
Frozen sections were ﬁxed in 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature. For BrdU staining, DNA denaturation was performed by
incubating the sections in 2 N HCl at 60  C for 15 min and then the
sections were neutralized in borate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.5). To
enhance antigen retrieval, sections were heated in sodium citrate
buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) for 5 min in a microwave, and then cooled at
room temperature for 20 min. Antibody non-speciﬁc binding
blockage was performed using 10% horse serum in PBS. Sections
were incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4  C. The

following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-BrdU (1:50,
Cell Signaling, #5292), rabbit anti-doublecortin (1:200, DCX,
Abcam, #ab18723), rabbit anti-von Willebrand factor (1:200, vWF,
Millipore, #AB7356), and mouse anti-ED1 (1:500, Abcam,
#ab31630). Secondary antibody reactions were performed at room
temperature for 2 h. The following secondary antibodies were used:
Dylight 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Abcam, #ab96885), Dylight
594 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Abcam, #ab96873), Dylight 488
donkey anti rabbit IgG (1:200, Abcam, #ab96891), and Dylight 488
donkey anti mouse IgG (1:200, Abcam, #ab96875). Finally, sections
were mounted using Vectashield with 40 , 6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories). All ﬂuorescence images were acquired with an EVOS microscope (AMG).
2.8. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) assay
Apoptotic cells were visualized using a DeadEnd™ Colorimetric
TUNEL System (Promega, #G7130) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Frozen sections were permeabilized in 20 mg/mL of
proteinase K and incubated with the recombinant terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase reaction mixture for 60 min at 37  C.
Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% H2O2. The sections
were incubated in a streptavidin HRP solution, and color development was obtained using 3, 30 -diaminobenzidine solution for
10 min. Counterstain was performed with methyl green (Vector
Laboratories). All microscopic images were obtained using an
Aperio ScanScope AT (Leica, Seoul, South Korea).
2.9. Ex vivo optical imaging and analysis
21 h after intravenous injection, the rats were sacriﬁced. Brains
were isolated and coronal slices were cut at an interval of 2 mm
using a brain matrix. Near-infrared ﬂuorescence (NIRF) imaging
was performed using a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum system (Caliper Life
Science) with a self-ﬁxed Cy5.5 ﬁlter set (excitation ¼ 640 nm,
emission ¼ 700 nm), as previously described. Fluorescence emission was normalized to photons per second per centimeter squared
per steradian (p/s/cm2/sr). The ﬂuorescence intensity was calculated from the obtained ﬂuorescence signals using the Living Image® 2.5 Software provided by the manufacturer. Regions of
interest (ROI) were drawn for both hemispheres, and each ﬂux
value was individually obtained in sections.
2.10. Cresyl violet staining and infarct size measurement
Frozen sections were stained with 0.5% cresyl violet solution for
5 min, and then were dehydrated sequentially in 70%, 80%, 90%, and
100% ethanol. Microscopic images of whole sections were obtained
using an Aperio scanscope AT. Infarct size was measured using NIH
ImageJ v1.48 software. Indirect infarct size was calculated by subtracting the non-infarcted region in the ipsilateral hemisphere from
the whole contralateral hemisphere.
2.11. Quantiﬁcation of immunoﬂuorescence and TUNEL images
Staining experiments were performed with one coronal section
that corresponded to the coordinates of the stereotaxic injection
(bregma 0.0 mm) in rats that had been intracerebrally infused with
SDF-1a alone. Staining experiments and quantiﬁcation analysis
(including cresyl violet staining) were performed in three coronal
sections in rats subjected to targeted delivery of the polymer (2.0,
1.0, and 0.0 mm from the bregma), corresponding to where the
SDF-1a was abundantly delivered. The sum of the values from all
three sections was used as the ﬁnal value.

D.H. Kim et al. / Biomaterials 61 (2015) 115e125

BrdU and doublecortin (DCX) double-positive cells were counted at 200 magniﬁcation in the entire SVZ with the multipoint
tool in ImageJ. To measure the immunoreactivity of von Willebrand
factor (vWF), three (intracerebral infusion experiment) or ﬁve
(targeted delivery experiment) images were randomly acquired
under 200 magniﬁcation around the ischemic border zone (IBZ).
All images were converted to 8-bit grayscale images. The dark
signals were drawn using magic wand tools and total area of the
ROI was measured using Multi Gauge 3.0 software (Fujiﬁlm). The
sum of the signal values measured in each microscopic ﬁeld was
used as the ﬁnal value. To determine the number of apoptotic cells,
TUNEL-positive cells were counted in three (intracerebral infusion
experiment) or ﬁve (targeted delivery experiment) random ﬁelds at
200 magniﬁcation from IBZ. The sum of the values was used as
the ﬁnal value.
2.12. ELISA
The animals were sacriﬁced 24 h after MCAO. Brains were isolated and the ipsilateral hemisphere was dissected into 3-mm
coronal sections (bregma 1.00e PubMed; þ2.00 mm). Tissue
was homogenized in PBS with protease inhibitors. Total protein
concentration in all samples was assessed using a DC™ protein
assay reagent kit (BioRad Laboratories, CA, USA) and the samples
were normalized to an equivalent concentration. The amount of
SDF-1a was measured using the SDF-1 ELISA kit (R&D systems)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Optical density was
determined using a microplate reader at 450 nm. Standards and
samples were measured in duplicate.

119

(excitation ¼ 640 nm, emission ¼ 700 nm). Fluorescence emission
was normalized to photons per second per centimeter squared per
steradian (p/s/cm2/sr). The ﬂuorescence intensity was calculated
from the obtained ﬂuorescence signals using the Living Image® 2.5
Software provided by the manufacturer. The tissue distribution of
nanoparticles was quantiﬁed by measuring NIRF intensity at the
region of interest. All values are expressed as means ± SD for groups
of three animals.
2.15. Histology
Female BALB/c mice (7 weeks old, Jungang Lab Animal Inc.,
Seoul, Korea) were used for this study. The pH-PM were injected
into the tail vein at a dose of 10 mg/kg. For control experiment, the
mice were also injected with saline (N.C). The mice were sacriﬁced
at 24 h post-treatment, and the major organs were harvested. For
histological analysis, the harvested organs were ﬁxed with 4%
formaldehyde solution and then embedded in parafﬁn. The
parafﬁn-embedded sliced tissues (5 mm) were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). The histological and immunohistochemical alterations were detected by a microscope (Zeiss LSM 510,
Carl Zeiss Micro Imaging GmbH, Germany).
2.16. Statistics analysis
Graphs represent mean ± standard error of the mean. Data were
analyzed using independent t-tests and one-way ANOVAs followed
by Turkey HSD post hoc tests using SPSS 20 (IBM) statistical analysis software. Data were considered statistically signiﬁcant if
p < 0.05.

2.13. Cytotoxicity
3. Results
NIH 3T3 cell lines, obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Rockville, MD, USA), were cultured in DMEM medium
(Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 1% (w/v) penicillin-streptomycin at 37  C in a
humidiﬁed 5% CO2-95% air atmosphere. The cells were seeded at a
density of 1  104 cells/well in 96-well ﬂat-bottomed plates. After
one day of growth, the cells were washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4)
and incubated for 24 h with various concentrations of pH-PM. The
cells were then washed twice with PBS and fresh culture medium
was added. Twenty microliters of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solution (5 mg/mL in PBS)
were added to each well, and the cells were incubated for an
additional 2 h at 37  C. Subsequently, the medium was removed,
and cells were dissolved in DMSO. The absorbance at 490 nm was
measured using a microplate reader (BioTek, Seoul, Korea).
2.14. Biodistribution of Cy5.5-labeled pH-PM
Adult male SpragueeDawley rats (270e310 g) were supplied by
the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology
(Daejeon, Korea). All experiments with live animals were performed in compliance with the relevant laws and institutional
guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Research Center (LARC; AAALAC International-approved facility) at the Samsung Medical Center. The experiment is performed with normal SD rat. For this
experiment, Cy5.5-labeled pH-PM were prepared as previously
described [23]. After the acclimatization of rats, Cy5.5-labeled pHPM were injected into the tail vein at a dose of 3.34 mg/kg. For
control experiment, the rats were also injected with saline (N.C).
The major organs were dissected from mice at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h,
and 72 h after the intravenous injection of Cy5.5-labeled pH-PM.
NIRF imaging was performed using a Xenogen IVIS Spectrum system (Caliper Life Science) with a self-ﬁxed Cy5.5 ﬁlter set

3.1. Synthesis and characterization of pH-responsive polymer and
protein-loaded pH-responsive polymer
For synthesis of pH-responsive PUASM copolymer, DHASM was
ﬁrst prepared by Michael-addition reaction between DEA and SMA
(Fig. 2). The 1H NMR spectrum for DHASM showed that the peaks
from the alkene region completely disappeared and new peaks
corresponding to the DEA appeared at 3.42 ppm and
2.55e3.44 ppm, indicating the complete conversion of alkene
functionality (Fig. S1). Then, the PUASM copolymer was synthesized by the polyaddition polymerization of HDI with DHASM and
HO-PEG-OH in the presence of DBTL as a catalyst. Fig. S2 shows the
1
H NMR spectra of PUASM copolymer. The characteristic peaks of
PEG appeared at 3.60 ppm, whereas HDI showed the characteristic
peaks at 3.18 ppm and 0.81e1.63 ppm. In contrast, pH-responsive
DHASM peaks appeared in the aromatic (6.60e8.08 ppm) and
aliphatic (4.2 ppm, 3.5 ppm, 3.0 ppm, 2.8 ppm, and 2.5 ppm) regions, indicating the formation of pH-responsive polymer.
Owing to their amphiphilic nature, the PUASM copolymer could
form micelles in an aqueous condition. The pH-dependent particle
sizes of bare pH-PM and Lysozyme-pH-PM in aqueous solutions
was measured using DLS at different pH values ranging from 5 to 9
(Fig. 3A). Interestingly, we found that the pH-sensitive copolymer
can be dissolved completely in PBS below a pH of 5.5 or above a pH
of 8 owing to the ionization of tertiary amine groups and sulfonamide groups, respectively. Herein, the anionic sulfamethazine part
can help to make a complex with lysozyme due to the electrostatic
interactions. When the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4, the
sulfonamide groups of DHASM were deionized and became hydrophobic, whereas amino groups of DHASM are not ionized. As a
consequence, the pH-sensitive DHASM moiety formed the hydrophobic core of the polymeric micelle and was shielded by a shell of

D.H. Kim et al. / Biomaterials 61 (2015) 115e125

hydrophilic PEG. Consequently, the pH-PM exhibited a stable
micellar state in the physiological buffer (pH 7.4). When the pH of
the solution was lower than 5.5, the amino groups of the DHASM
were fully ionized and the polymeric micelle disappeared in
aqueous solutions.
The pH-dependent net charges of the native lysozyme and
Lysozyme-pH-PM were evaluated by zeta potential measurements.
As shown in Fig. 3B, the net charge of the lysozyme below a pH of 9
was highly positive. However, the Lysozyme-pH-PM showed a zeta
potential toward zero until a pH of 5 because of the neutral PEG
shielding the polymeric micelles. When the pH is lower than 5.5,
the zeta potential of the Lysozyme-pH-PM rapidly increases, indicating that the amino groups with lone electron pairs in the DHASM
chain can be protonated. Thus, polymeric micelles released the
lysozyme caused by electrostatic repulsion.
3.2. The pH-sensitive polymer facilitates the delivery of SDF-1a into
the ischemic brain
To evaluate whether the pH-PM effectively delivered SDF-1a
into the brain infarct, we loaded Cy5.5-SDF-1a into pH-PM and
administered it intravenously 3 h after permanent MCAO. 24 h after
occlusion, ex vivo optical imaging was performed to detect the
Cy5.5 ﬂuorescence signal (Fig. 4A and B). Systemic administration
of Cy5.5-SDF-1a increased Cy5.5 intensity in the ischemic hemisphere and the administration of a Cy5.5-SDF-1a-pH-PM signiﬁcantly increased the Cy5.5 intensity compared to that observed
upon delivery without a pH-sensitive polymer. There was no signiﬁcant difference in Cy5.5 intensity in the contralateral hemisphere. ELISA was also performed to measure the concentration of
SDF-1a in the brains of rats that received bare Cy5.5-SDF-1a, and it
conﬁrmed that the intravenous administration of Cy5.5-SDF-1apH-PM signiﬁcantly increased the SDF-1a level in the ischemic
region (Fig. 4C).
3.3. SDF-1a delivered by pH-PM enhances neurogenesis and
angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia
Before testing the therapeutic effects of SDF-1a targeted delivery by pH-PM, we ﬁrst determined whether SDF-1a has regenerative and neuroprotective effects in vivo. We locally infused SDF1a into the striatum 1 day after transient MCAO (Fig. S3). The
number of BrdU and DCX-positive cells in the subventricular zone
(SVZ) increased in the focal ischemia group compared with that in
the sham and vehicle group 7 days after ischemia. These numbers

signiﬁcantly increased in the SDF-1a group compared to those in
the control group, which was conﬁrmed by counting all BrdU/DCX
double-positive cells in the entire area of SVZ, a quantitative
analysis of neurogenesis. In addition, locally infused SDF-1a
signiﬁcantly increased the density of vWF-positive vessels in the
ischemic border zone (IBZ). The TUNEL assay also showed that
locally infused SDF-1a blocked apoptotic cell death in the IBZ.
To evaluate whether SDF-1a delivery using pH-PM enhanced
neurogenesis, immunohistochemistry was performed to assess
BrdU and DCX immunoreactivity in the SVZ 7 days after permanent

solution with a 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme solution.

MCAO, and the data were quantitatively analyzed (Fig. 5). DCXpositive migrating neuroblasts and BrdU-positive proliferating
cells in the ipsilateral SVZ increased following ischemia. This result
indicated that the SDF-1a delivery using a pH-PM increased the
number of proliferating and migrating cells compared to that
observed with vehicle treatment and intravenous treatment of
SDF-1a alone; this suggests that neurogenesis was enhanced.
We also performed immunostaining with anti-vWF and a
quantitative analysis in the ipsilateral IBZ to investigate angiogenesis levels with treatment of SDF-1a alone or with the polymer. The
number of vWF-expressing microvessels increased following
ischemia and further increased with SDF-1a delivery using the pHPM (Fig. 6).
3.4. Delivered SDF-1a does not enhance neuroprotection in cerebral
ischemia
The neuroprotective effect of SDF-1a targeted delivery was
investigated by measuring infarct size and apoptosis level. Infarct
size, as measured by cresyl violet staining in three coronal sections
per rat, was not different among groups (Fig. 7). In addition, the
TUNEL assay showed a non-signiﬁcant trend towards a decrease in
apoptotic cells in SDF-1a-treated groups compared to the trends
observed in the other groups.
3.5. Delivered SDF-1a does not inﬂuence inﬂammatory response
after cerebral ischemia
To preclude the possibility that an increase in SDF-1a in the
ischemic brain induces an inﬂammatory response including
microglia activation and leukocyte inﬁltration, we investigated
anti-ED1 immunoreactivity in the IBZ, which is detected in

121

activated microglia and inﬁltrated monocytes. There was no difference in ED-1 expression between the control and ischemiainduced groups (Fig. 8A and B). Additionally, the possible toxic effects of the polymer were measured in vivo. Survival rates after
treatment with the polymer, SDF-1a, or both were not different
from the control group (Fig. 8C).
3.6. In vitro cytotoxicity
In order to observe the biocompatibility of polymers, the cytotoxicities of various concentrations of pH-PM were evaluated using
NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. S4). Owing to their biocompatibility, bare micelles resulted in no noticeable cytotoxicity to the NIH 3T3 cells. In
particular, most cells were viable up to 1000 mg/mL of the
copolymers.
3.7. Biodistribution and safety assessment of pH-PM
For polymeric micelles to be practically useful, they should be
degraded or eliminated from the body through renal excretion as
non-toxic products after performing its role. The distribution of pHPM treated rats were evaluated by monitoring ﬂuorescence imaging of major organs. The accumulation of micelles in various organs
is presented in Figs. S5 and S6. The results indicated that pH-PM
were rapidly cleared from the body and most of the micelles
were accumulated in kidney. The high ﬂuorescence intensity in
kidney suggested that the pH-PM were excreted and removed from
the body by urine. To further evaluate the safety proﬁle of pH-PM,
organs of pH-PM treated mice were harvested and stained with
H&E (Fig. S7). Pathological examinations of pH-PM treated group
showed that all organs exhibited normal histological structures.
Thus, pH-PM have high safety proﬁle in clinical application.

4. Discussion
In normal and stroke brains, the local microenvironment controls the level of neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The stroke-

induced restoration process is usually limited owing to its transient and relatively low level presence of chemokines, miRNA, and
trophic factors. Therefore, targeted delivery of these therapeutic
substances into the injured area could optimize the brain infarction

microenvironment to enhance neuroreparative processes. Specifically, adjusting the regional levels of chemokines or trophic factors
and the expression of miRNAs that are associated with neurogenesis and angiogenesis to the levels observed in the acute phase
of stroke may prolong the recovery period after stroke.
There have been several attempts to control the microenvironment in stroke. First, systemic or stereotaxic administration of
trophic factors, erythropoietin, or genetic components could be
applied to stroke patients. However, the use of these substances has
been limited due to challenges of short half-life, protein aggregation, and toxicity [24]. In particular, systemic effects of trophic
factors lead to the possibility of integration of vector DNA into the
host chromosome [25,26]. Second, external global stimuli, such as
an enriched environment, physical activity, and magnetic stimulation, may inﬂuence the microenvironment to evoke endogenous,
neurogenesis, and angiogenesis [27]. These approaches may safely
increase the levels of trophic factors in the infarcted brain, but
require both a long time and patient cooperation. Finally, clinical
trials have shown that functional improvement occurs shortly after
cell therapy and diminishes with time, suggesting that the effects of
MSCs are mediated via trophic support rather than the replacement
of damaged cells [28,29]. MSCs secrete a variety of bioactive substances in the injured brain, including trophic factors and miRNAs,
which may be associated with enhanced neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and inﬂammation attenuation [30,31]. However, stem cell
therapies harbor the risk of cell-mediated adverse effects. To

surmount these issues, in this study, an attempt was made to
deliver trophic factor SDF-1a by utilizing pH-PM, which allow the
site-speciﬁc delivery of SDF-1a to the infarct region (Fig. 1).
The pH-sensitive polymer is composed of three domains: a
neutral hydrophilic PEG shell, hydrophobic HDI backbone, and pHsensitive DHASM segment. In particular, the charge of the pHsensitive segment can switch from negative to positive in acidic
conditions. SDF-1a is cationic protein that has an isoelectric point of
9.76. The pH-sensitive segment from the copolymer can bind to
SDF-1a in alkali conditions and this complex forms a micelle in
neutral pH due to the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interaction.
Moreover, in acidic conditions, the pH-sensitive polymer is able to
release SDF-1a as a result of charge repulsion. It is known that brain
tissue acidosis is caused by lactic acid accumulation after cerebral
ischemia [32]. In the rat model of permanent stroke, brain acidosis
is induced 3 h after ischemia onset and the pH level drops down to
approximately 6.5 at 4 h [33]. The pH-sensitive polymer could also
be used as a theranostic agent for pH-stimulated tissue, such as
cancerous tissue or ischemia. Our preliminary data showed that
intravenous application of a pH-sensitive polymer could facilitate
the delivery of a target protein (Lysozyme and SDF-1a) into the
ischemic region as effectively as stereotaxic application in a rat
model of acute stroke.
The results of our present study showed that SDF-1a-pH-PM
effectively increased the levels of SDF-1a in the ischemic brain and
evoked neurogenesis and angiogenesis. Our in vivo data are in line

124

with previous reports that have shown an increase in vascular
density in the ischemic cortex of rats that received intracerebral
administration of SDF-1a [6]. SDF-1a secreted from an infarct region enhances the recruitment of NSCs to lesion sites via longrange migration, which initiates endogenous stem cell-based tissue repair [34]. After ischemic stroke, SDF-1 expression is upregulated in activated astrocytes and endothelial cells [35]. However,
the SDF-1a expression may be limited in certain situations, such as
at a chronic stage, in less extensive lesions, or at a younger age
[36,37]. SDF-1a expression is upregulated in the infarcted hemisphere within 24 h after stroke and disappears after 1 month [38].
Our approach would provide a novel method of microenvironmental control that is a more sophisticated tool than trophic factor
or stem cell therapy and avoids systemic toxic effects or cellmediated adverse effects.
In addition to its neurogenetic and angiogenetic capacity, SDF1a exerts various beneﬁcial effects for recovery after stroke. Nonneuronal adult progenitor/stem cells circulate between organs for
repair and maintenance of tissues [37,38]. Circulating MSCs and
EPCs from bone marrow were increased after acute stroke, and may
relate to recovery after stroke [39,40]. MSCs promote endogenous
plasticity, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis [41]. SDF-1a has
emerged as a major attractant of NSCs and MSCs because both types
of cells express CXCR4 (a receptor for SDF-1a); upregulation of SDF1a/CXCR4 signaling can increase the number of MSCs in infarct
areas [36,42]. SDF-1a mediates NSCs survival by apoptosis inhibition. Therefore, our approach of SDF-1a targeted delivery can be
applied in conjunction with cell therapy; the effects of cell therapy
could be maximized with increased tissue levels of SDF-1a. The
effects of the application of bone marrow MSCs with SDF-1a-pHPM are currently under investigation.
However, the results of this study cannot be generalized to
subacute/chronic stroke or transient brain ischemia. In the present
study, the pH-PM was injected 3 h after permanent MCAO because
the efﬁcacy of pH-PM targeted delivery rapidly decreased at a later
time point and was less remarkable in a transient MCAO model. It
has been reported that the pH in the infarct region is approximately
6.5, compared to a pH range of 7.0e7.4 in normal brain regions
[33,43]. However, the decrease in pH is normalized during the
subacute phase of stroke. In addition, quantitative analysis revealed
that the accumulation of Cy5.5-SDF-1a in the ischemic area of the
brain after administration of Cy5.5-SDF-1a-pH-PM was signiﬁcantly higher in the rat model of permanent MCAO than in the
model of transient MCAO. This may be because transient brain
ischemia causes a more rapid post-ischemic normalization of brain
tissue pH. Other polymeric approaches are needed to target delivery in these situations. Several polymeric nanocomplexes have
been reported to deliver and release proteins or drugs in response
to environmental stimuli, such as enzyme exposure [44], redox
environment [45,46], and possibly hypoxia [47]. Further studies are
needed using these polymers to extend the viable range of treatment methods. Other well-known molecules (e.g., sildenaﬁl) that
reportedly enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis should be
tested to assess whether their targeted delivery can also modulate
the microenvironment after stroke.
5. Conclusion
The present study shows a novel approach to control the
microenvironment using the targeted delivery of a polymer. A dual
ionic pH-sensitive PUASM copolymer was successfully synthesized,
and hydrophilic SDF-1a-was efﬁciently loaded through ionic
interaction. The SDF-1a-pH-PM maintained a stable micellar state
in a physiological buffer (pH 7.4) with a particle size of 150 nm.
When the pH is below 5.5 or above 8.0, the polymeric micelle

completely disappeared. As a result, the SDF-1a-pH-PM can be used
as pH-triggered targeting agents to effectively modify the microenvironment by increasing innate neurorestorative processes. We
expect that this approach can be useful for extending the length of
time for recovery after stroke. In addition, it may be globally
applicable for other therapeutic targets that modify the microenvironment in ischemic tissue and for diseases that undergo tissue
acidosis, such as tumors, inﬂammation, and ischemia.
