ABSTRACT
To test, in vivo, the hypothesis that exosomes from
multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) mediate
microRNA 133b (miR-133b) transfer which promotes neurological recovery from stroke, we used knockin and
knockdown technologies to upregulate or downregulate
the miR-133b level in MSCs (miR-133b1MSCs or miR133b2MSCs) and their corresponding exosomes, respectively. Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAo) and were treated with naı̈ve MSCs,
miR-133b1MSCs, or miR-133b2MSC at 1 day after
MCAo. Compared with controls, rats receiving naı̈ve MSC
treatment significantly improved functional recovery and
exhibited increased axonal plasticity and neurite remodeling in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) at day 14 after
MCAo. The outcomes were significantly enhanced with
miR-133b1MSC treatment, and were significantly
decreased with miR-133b2MSC treatment, compared to
naı̈ve MSC treatment. The miR-133b level in exosomes

collected from the cerebral spinal fluid was significantly
increased after miR-133b1MSC treatment, and was significantly decreased after miR-133b2MSC treatment at day
14 after MCAo, compared to naı̈ve MSC treatment. Tagging exosomes with green fluorescent protein demonstrated that exosomes-enriched extracellular particles were
released from MSCs and transferred to adjacent astrocytes and neurons. The expression of selective targets for
miR-133b, connective tissue growth factor and ras homolog gene family member A, was significantly decreased in
the IBZ after miR-133b1MSC treatment, while their
expression remained at similar elevated levels after miR133b2MSC treatment, compared to naı̈ve MSC treatment.
Collectively, our data suggest that exosomes from MSCs
mediate the miR-133b transfer to astrocytes and neurons,
which regulate gene expression, subsequently benefit
neurite remodeling and functional recovery after stroke.

INTRODUCTION
In eukaryotic cells, microRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a major
regulatory gene family [1–4]. The human genome may encode
over 1,000 miRNAs [3] that target approximately 60% of
mammalian genes [5, 6] and are abundant in many human
cell types [7]. By affecting gene expression, miRNAs are
likely involved in most biological processes [8–12]. The function of individual miRNAs is just beginning to emerge in
mature neurons, while the role of miRNAs at various stages
of neuronal development and maturation has been recently
elucidated [13–15]. Numerous miRNAs are expressed in
spatially and temporally controlled manners in the nervous

system [16–21], consistent with the hypothesis that miRNAs
have important roles in the gene regulatory networks involved
in adult neural plasticity [17, 22-24].
Exosomes are membrane vesicles that contain RNA molecules including messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and miRNAs,
which can be transferred between cells and thus affect the
protein production of recipient cells [25–27]. Increasing
evidence indicates that exosomes play an important role in
cell-to-cell communication [28–32]. In the nervous system,
exosomes mediate cell-cell communication including the
transfer of synaptic proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs [29].
Those exosomes either act locally within the presynaptic
terminal or are transported back to presynaptic neuronal cell
bodies and are associated with learning and memory [29].

miR-133b Promotes Functional Recovery of Stroke via MSC Exosomes

2738

Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have
potential therapeutic benefit in many diseases including neurological diseases, injury, and stroke [33–40]. Our previous in
vitro studies demonstrate that the miR-133b is significantly
increased in exosomes from MSCs exposed to ischemic cerebral extracts, and the miR-133b is transferred via exosomes to
astrocytes and neurons, which subsequently increase neurite
outgrowth [41]. In this study, we used knockin or knockdown
technologies to upregulate or downregulate the miR-133b
level in MSCs (miR-133bþMSCs or miR-133bMSCs) and
their corresponding exosomes, respectively, as gain or loss of
miR-133b function experiments, and then administered these
MSCs to rats subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo), to test whether in vivo the exosomes mediate miR133b transfer to neural cells and subsequently promote neurite
remodeling and functional recovery after MCAo.

MATERIALS

AND

METHODS

All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Henry Ford
Hospital.

MSC Cultures and Lentiviral Production for MiR133b Knocked-In or Knocked-Down MSCs
Bone marrow from male Wistar rats was mechanically dissociated, and the cells were washed and suspended in culture medium. Three days later, cells that tightly adhered to the plastic
flasks were considered as P0 MSCs [42–44]. MSCs were cultured with a-modified MEM medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT,
http://www.thermoscientific.com/ecomm/servlet/newsdetail?
storeId=11152&contentId=52427&ca=hyclone) containing 20%
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco Laboratory, Grand Island, NY,
http://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home/brands/gibco.html?
cid=fl-gibco) and penicillin-streptomycin on 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks (Corning St. Louis, MO, http://www.corning.com/
lifesciences/us_canada/en/index.aspx) and 3–4 passages (P3–4)
were used for lentivirus infection. MSCs were passaged or collected for injection when they achieved 80%–90% confluence.
For the exosome isolation, we replaced conventional culture
medium with an exosome depleted FBS (EXO-FBS-250A-1,
System Biosciences, Inc., Mountain View, CA, http://www.
systembio.com/) medium when the cells reached 60%–80% confluence. Followed by an additional 24 hours of culturing and the
media were then collected for centrifugation.
We packaged the lentiviruses that contain the vectors of
LentimiRa-GFP-hsa-miR-133b Vector (mh10170, Applied Biological Materials Inc., Richmond, BC, V6V 2G2 CANADA,
http://www.abmgood.com/, pre-miR-133b inserted for miR133b knockin), pLenti-III-miR-GFP Control Vector (m001,
Applied Biological Materials Inc., vector for miR-133b
knockin control, http://www.abmgood.com/), miRZip-133b
anti-miR-133b miRNA construct (MZIP133b-PA-1, System
Biosciences, Inc., Mountain View, CA, http://www.systembio.
com/, miR-133b inhibitor inserted for miR-133b knockdown),
and pGreenPuro Scramble Hairpin Control Construct
(MZIP000-PA-1, System Biosciences, Inc., Mountain View,
CA, http://www.systembio.com/, vector for miR-133b knockdown control), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s
suggested protocol. We then infected the primary cultured
MSCs with these lentiviruses, to generate miR-133b knockedin or knocked-down MSCs, respectively. The infection efficiency was monitored by the green fluorescent protein (GFP),

and puromycin was used for selection of stable cell lines. The
four stable MSC cell lines generated were identified as: miR133bþMSC, miR-133bþCONMSC, miR-133bMSC, and miR133bCONMSC, respectively.

MCAo Model
Adult male Wistar rats (weighing 270–300 g, n = 51) purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA, http://
www.criver.com/) were subjected to right MCAo using a
method of intraluminal vascular occlusion as modified in our
laboratory [34]. Briefly, rats were initially anesthetized with
3.5% isoflurane and maintained with 1.0%–2.0% isoflurane in
70% N2O and 30% O2 using a face mask. Rectal temperature
was maintained at 37 C throughout the surgical procedure
using a feedback regulated water heating system. A length of
4-0 monofilament nylon suture (18.5–19.5 mm), determined
by the animal weight, with its tip rounded by heating near a
flame, was advanced from the external carotid artery into the
lumen of the internal carotid artery until it blocked the origin
of the MCA. Two hours after MCAo, animals were reanesthetized with isoflurane and reperfusion was performed by withdrawal of the suture until the tip cleared the lumen of the
external carotid artery in 2 minutes. Immunosuppressants
were not used in any animals in this study.

MSC Administration
At 24 hours postischemia, randomly selected rats (n ¼ 6/
group, n ¼ 36 in total) received naive MSC, miR-133bþMSC,
miR-133bMSC,
and
miRmiR-133bþCONMSC,
133bCONMSC or vehicle administration. Approximately 3 
106 MSCs in 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS
alone was slowly injected via the tail vein over a 5-minute
period into each rat. Behavioral tests, including the adhesiveremoval test (used to measure somatosensory deficits [33, 45,
46]) and the Foot-fault test (used to measure forelimb dysfunction [33, 46, 47]), were performed at day 1 post-MCAo
immediately prior to the treatment, and at days 3, 7, and 14
after MCAo. All rats were sacrificed at 14 days after MCAo.
To test the corresponding miR-133b level in the exosomes
released in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), CSF samples were
acquired immediately prior to sacrifice. At the end of the
experiment, rats were deeply anesthetized with a Ketamine
(160 mg/kg) and Xylazine (26 mg/kg) mixture intraperitoneally, and were transcardially perfused with heparinized saline.
Rat brains were snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
in 80 C. A standard frozen block (within the center of the
lesion of MCAo) corresponding to coronal coordinates
bregma 2.0 to 2.0 mm was obtained from which a series of
40 lm thickness were performed for molecular studies (Western blot and RT-PCR) and 8 lm thickness for histochemistry
and immunostaining.

MSC Exosome Isolation
The exosome isolation was performed at 4 C, as previously
described [48, 49]. Briefly, the supernatants collected from
cultured MSCs or the CSF (diluted with 20 mM HEPES)
were first filtered through a 0.2 lm filter to remove large debris and dead cells. Small-cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000g for 30 minutes, and then the resulting
supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000g for 3 hours.
By this step, the pellets primarily contained exosomes [49].
For purification of the exosomes, the pellets containing exosomes were resuspended in 0.25 M sucrose buffered with 20
mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and loaded onto a sucrose step gradient
(2.5, 2.25, 2.0, 1.75, 1.5, 1.25, 1.0, 0.75, and 0.5 M). The sucrose gradient was then centrifuged at 100,000g for 5 hours
and 10 fractions were collected and diluted with 20 mM

Xin, Li, Liu et al.

HEPES, pH 7.4, and recentrifuged at 100,000g for 1.5 hours.
Exosomes can be identified by the marker proteins, CD63
[50, 51] or Alix [52–54], using Western blot as well as by
electron microscopy to verify the exosome presence [55, 56].
The final exosome pellets harvested from 1  107 cells were
identified as previously described [41] and resuspended in 30–
50 ll of PBS and stored at 80 C for further use.

MiRNA Assay
For the measurement of miR-133b in exosomes from the CSF
and cultured cells, samples were lysed in Qiazol reagents and
the total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Mini kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, http://www.qiagen.com/). By RTPCR, we detected the miR-133b level. Briefly, miRNAs were
reverse transcribed with the miRNA Reverse Transcription kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, http://www.lifetechno
logies.com/us/en/home/brands/applied-biosystems.html)
and
PCR amplifcation was performed with the TaqMan miRNA
assay kit (Applied Biosystems, which is specific for mature
miRNA sequences, http://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/
home/brands/applied-biosystems.html) according to the manufacturer’s protocols, with U6 snRNA as an internal control.

Biotinylated Dextran Amine Label for Detection of
Axonal Plasticity
Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) (3,000 Da, 10% solution
in PBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, http://www.lifetechnolo
gies.com/us/en/home/brands/invitrogen.html?cid=fl-invitro
gen) was used to retrogradely label pyramidal neurons in additional rats subjected to MCAo following previously described
procedures [40]. Briefly, additional MCAo rats (n ¼ 3/group, n
¼ 12 in total) were treated with PBS, naive MSCs, miR133bþMSCs, or miR-133bMSCs (3  106, respectively) via
tail vein injection at 1 day after MCAo, and 100 nl of BDA was
injected into the contralateral pyramidal tract at the medulla level
at 7 days before sacrifice. At day 14 after MCAo, animals were
transcardially perfused with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde.
The cervical spinal cord segments of C1 and C4-6 were processed for vibratome traverse section (75 lm). Sections were
incubated with 0.5% H2O2 for 20 minutes followed with avidinbiotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
CA, http://www.vectorlabs.com/) at 4 C for 48 hours,
and BDA-labeled axons were visualized with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) for light microscopy examination. Subsequently,
BDA-positive labeling axonal densities in the ipsilateral area
were quantitatively measured as the indicator of axonal
plasticity.

Histochemistry and Immunostaining
To address the neurite remodeling in the ischemic boundary
zone (IBZ), Bielshowsky silver (a marker of neuronal fibers)
histochemistry staining and neurofilament heavy 200 kDa (NF200, a marker for apical dendrites of large cortical pyramidal
neurons [57, 58]) immunostaining and synaptophysin (a marker
for synapses, since synaptophysin is ubiquitously present at the
synapses [59]) immunostaining were used, respectively. Briefly,
for histochemistry staining, 8-lm thick frozen brain slides were
placed in 20% silver nitrate in the dark, then ammonium hydroxide was added to stain the slides until the tissues turned
brown with a gold background and they were then treated with
sodium thiosulfate. For immunostaining, adjacent frozen brain
sections were incubated with the primary antibodies against NF200 (dilution 1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, MA. ab82259, http://
www.abcam.com/) and synaptophysin (dilution 1:100, Millipore,
Billerica, Massachusetts. MAB5258, http://www.millipore.com/
antibodies/flx4/antibodieshome), followed with corresponding
horseradish peroxidase conjugated to secondary antibodies and

DAB developing, respectively. Positive staining within nine
areas (four from the cortex, four from the striatum, and one
from the corpus callosum) selected along the IBZ in these
groups was measured using a light microscope [60]. The MicroComputer Imaging Device software was used to analyze the
integrated density of positive staining signal within the IBZ.

Expression of GFP-Tagged CD63 in MSCs and
Exosome Secretion and Uptake
MSCs were cultured overnight in six-well plates to 60%–70%
confluence, then transfected with 4 lg/well of purified pCTCD63-GFP (CYTO120-PA-1, System Biosciences, Inc., Mountain View, CA, http://www.systembio.com/) using lipofectamine
2000 (11668-019, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, http://www.lifetech
nologies.com/us/en/home/brands/invitrogen.html?cid=fl-invitro
gen) reagent, as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were
selected with 10 lg/ml puromycin dihydrochloride (A11138-03,
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, http://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/
en/home/brands/invitrogen.html?cid=fl-invitrogen) for 3 weeks.
Puromycin-resistant and GFP-positive cells were further isolated,
expanded, and maintained in the selection medium as long as the
cells were in culture. The expression of GFP-CD63 in the
selected cell lines, herein referred to as CD63-GFP-MSCs, was
verified by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Another
group of rats (n ¼ 3) subjected to MCAo were administered with
these CD63-GFP-MSCs at 24 hours post stroke. At 14 days after
MCAo, rats were deeply anesthetized with a Ketamine and Xylazine and transcardially perfused with heparinized saline. Rat
brains were snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
80 C. The 8-lm thick frozen brain sections corresponding to
coronal coordinates bregma 1.0 to 1.0 mm [61] were generated
as noted above, and immunofluorescent staining was used to distinguish astrocytes and neurons with glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP, dilution 1:10,000, Dako Z0334; Dako, Carpinteria, CA,
http://www.dako.com/) and microtubule-associate protein 2
(MAP-2 for neuronal dendrites, dilution 1:200, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/united-states.html) followed
with corresponding Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies,
respectively. A laser scanning confocal microscope was used to
examine the secretion of exosomes from GFP tagged MSCs and
the up-take of exosomes by astrocytes and neurons.

Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as means 6 SE. The differences between
mean values were evaluated with the two-tailed Student’s t
test (for two groups) by the computer programs Microsoft
Excel 2000 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, http://www.micro
soft.com/). The Global test using the generalized estimating
equation was used to evaluate the MSC treatment effects
influenced by miR133b on functional recovery [62, 63].
Repeated measures analysis was used to evaluate data with
repeated measurements over time (e.g., functional tests) or
histological evaluation on multiple regions per subject. Analysis began testing for the factor interaction, followed by testing
the main factor effect if no interaction was detected at 0.05
level, and/or a subgroup analysis, if the interaction or main
effect was detected at 0.05 level [64].

expression level in cells and exosomes compared to those in miR-133bCONMSCs (B). Growth curve analysis shows that miR-133bþMSCs and miR133bMSCs and their corresponding control MSCs exhibit similar cell proliferation character (C). The data of counting GFP tag positive cells show that

(miR-133bCONMSC), respectively. GFP was used to monitor
the infection efficiency (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR data show that the
miR-133b expression level in miR-133bþMSCs and in their
exosomes was significantly increased compared to those in miR133bþCONMSCs, and miR-133b expression level was significantly decreased in miR-133bMSCs and in their exosomes
compared to those in miR-133bCONMSCs (Fig. 1B). These data
indicate that lentivirus systems containing the pre-miR133b or
anti-miR-133b inhibitor successfully increase or decrease miR133b levels in the MSCs and their exosomes, respectively.
To test whether miR-133b knockin or knockdown affects
the cell characteristics of MSCs, such as proliferation, we
seeded 1  104 miR-133bþMSCs and miR-133bMSCs as
well as their corresponding control miR-133bþCONMSCs and
miR-133bCONMSCs into 24-well plates. These cells were conventionally cultured for 7 days, and the cell numbers were
counted to perform cell growth curve analysis. We calculated
the growth rate of each cell type by counting the total numbers
of the cells in triplicate wells every day until 7 days. Data
showed that there were no significant differences in proliferation among the four types of cells (Fig. 1C). Since miR133bþMSCs and miR-133bMSCs have the GFP tag, we also

counted the GFP-positive cell numbers under a fluorescent
microscope at 14 days after MCAo in the IBZ (Fig. 1D). There
were no significant differences of the two types of cells in the
IBZ (Fig. 1E). These data indicate that the two cell lines have
similar proliferation, survival, and trafficking to the brain.

MiR-133b Mediates MSC-Induced Functional
Recovery
Rats were subjected to 2 hours MCAo, received PBS, naive
MSCs, and four types of modified MSCs (3  106 per rat)
intravenously at 24 hours after MCAo (n ¼ 6/group). The adhesive-removal test (Fig. 2A) and Foot-fault test (Fig. 2B)
were performed prior to the treatment after MCAo (baseline),
at days 3 and 7, and at day 14 before sacrifice after MCAo.
Compared with PBS treatment, naive MSCs, miR133bþCONMSCs, and miR-133bCONMSCs significantly
improved functional recovery (adhesive-removal and Footfault) at day 14 after MCAo, while miR-133bþMSCs significantly improved functional recovery at day 7 (adhesive-removal test only) and day 14 (adhesive-removal and Footfault) after MCAo, and miR-133bMSCs had no obvious beneficial effects at these two time points. Compared with their
corresponding control MSC treatments, miR-133bþMSCs significantly improved, but miR-133bMSCs treatment

133bMSC treatment significantly decreased the positive
areas of Bielshowsky silver, NF-200, and synaptophysin staining at day 14 after MCAo compared with naive MSC treatment. These data suggest that miR-133b increases neurite
remodeling in the IBZ in vivo.

The adhesive-removal test (A) and Foot-fault test (B) were performed
prior to the treatment after MCAo (baseline), at days 3 and 7, and at

miR-133bCONMSCs significantly improved functional recovery at
day 14 after MCAo, while miR-133bþMSCs significantly improved
functional recovery at both day 7 (adhesive-removal test only) and 14
after MCAo, and miR-133bMSCs had no obvious beneficial effects
at these two time points. Compared with their corresponding control
MSC treatment, miR-133bþMSCs significantly improved, while miR133bMSCs treatment significantly decreased, functional recovery at
day 14 after MCAo. MCAo: MCAo rats administered with PBS,

that increased miR-133b expression in MSCs and in their
released exosomes enhances functional recovery after stroke.

MiR-133b Increases Axonal Plasticity and Neurite
Remodeling in the IBZ
BDA (3,000 Da) was used to retrogradely label pyramidal
neurons in rats subjected to MCAo. A representative image
shows the BDA-positive labeling in a rat brain (Fig. 3A). The
BDA-labeled axons in the caudal forelimb area of ipsilateral
side (Fig. 3B) to the lesion were quantitatively measured
using Image J (NIH Image). Data are shown as percentage of
proportional areas [65]. Intracortical axonal density was significantly increased after naive MSC treatment compared with
PBS treatment at day 14 after MCAo (Fig. 3C). MiR133bþMSC treatment significantly increased but miR133bMSC treatment significantly decreased the cortical axonal density at day 14 after MCAo compared with naive MSC
treatment (Fig. 3C), suggesting a role of MSC miR-133b in
promoting axonal plasticity after stroke.
Frozen coronal sections were used for Bielshowsky silver,
NF-200, and synaptophysin staining. Arrows indicate Bielshowsky silver, NF-200, and synaptophysin staining in the
IBZ (3D, 3G, and 3J, respectively) of the ipsilateral cortex
(3E, 3H, and 3K are enlarged from 3D, 3G, and 3J, respectively). Compared with PBS treatment (MCAo), the positive
areas of Bielshowsky silver (3F), NF-200 (3I), and synaptophysin (3L) staining significantly increased at day 14 after
MCAo along the IBZ after naive MSC treatment. MiR133bþMSC treatment significantly increased, but miRwww.StemCells.com

RT-PCR was used to measure the miR-133b level in exosomes collected from the CSF at day 14 after MCAo
(Fig. 4A). Our data show that MCAo decreased the miR-133b
level in the CSF exosomes. Treatment with naive MSCs
significantly increased miR-133b level in the CSF exosomes
compared to the MCAo control. MiR-133bþMSC treatment
further significantly increased miR-133b level in the CSF
exosomes while miR-133bMSCs treatment significantly
decreased the miR-133b level in the CSF exosomes, compared with the naive MSC treatment, respectively. These data
suggest that the miR-133b increase in MSC exosomes evoked
a miR-133b increase in the CSF.
To test the hypothesis that the exosomes mediate cell-cell
communication between MSCs and neural cells, we transfected MSCs with the plasmid containing CD63-GFP fusion
protein gene and treated rats subjected to MCAo with these
CD63-GFP-MSCs. CD63 is a surface protein used as a common marker of exosomes [66]. CD63-GFP was visualized in
exosomes using a laser scanning confocal microscope. As
shown in Figure 4B, 4C, exosomes released from MSCs
(arrows) in the IBZ were detected in adjacent astrocytes and
neurons (arrow heads).

MiR-133b Regulates the Connective Tissue Growth
Factor Expression in Astrocytes and the ras Homolog Gene Family Member A Expression in the IBZ
Immunostaining showed connective tissue growth factor
(CTGF) expression in the IBZ (Fig. 5A) colocalized with
GFAP (Fig. 5B). Immunostaining analysis data showed that
CTGF expression significantly increased in the IBZ at day 14
after MCAo compared with that in the normal rats. Administration of naive MSCs significantly decreased the CTGF
expression in the IBZ at day 14 after MCAo. Compared with
the naive MSC treatment, miR-133bþMSC treatment significantly decreased CTGF expression at day 14 after MCAo,
while miR-133bMSC treatment was sustained at a significantly elevated CTGF expression level in the IBZ at day 14
after MCAo (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that miR-133b regulates CTGF expression in astrocytes. Western blot was used
to detect the ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA)
level in the ipsilateral brain tissue (Fig. 5D), with the internal
control protein glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
The data showed that RhoA expression significantly increased
at day 14 after MCAo compared with normal rats. Naive
MSC treatment significantly decreased the RhoA expression
at day 14 after MCAo. MiR-133bþMSC treatment further significantly decreased RhoA at day 14 after MCAo compared
with that after naive MSC treatment, and the RhoA expression after miR-133b-MSC treatment was sustained at a similar
elevated level at day 14 after MCAo compared with naive
MSC treatment (Fig. 5E). These data indicate that RhoA
expression is regulated by miR-133b.

DISCUSSION
MSCs enhance functional recovery in experimental stroke
models [33, 64-66]. After stroke, only a very small percentage

miR-133b Promotes Functional Recovery of Stroke via MSC Exosomes

Figure 3. MiR-133b increases axonal plasticity and neurite remodeling in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ). A representative image shows the
biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)-positive labeling in a rat vobratome coronal brain section (A). The BDA-labeled axons in the caudal forelimb
area which ipsilateral to the lesion were enlarged in (B). Analysis data (C) show that intracortical axonal density was significantly increased after
naive MSC treatment compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment at day 14 after MCAo. MiR-133bþMSC treatment significantly
increased while miR-133bMSC treatment significantly decreased the cortical axonal density at day 14 after MCAo compared with naive MSC
treatment (p < .05, C). Bielshowsky silver staining, NF-200, and synaptophysin immunostaining were performed on adjacent frozen coronal brain
sections to detect the neurite remodeling. Arrows indicate Bielshowsky silver (D), NF-200 (G), and synaptophysin (J) staining in the IBZ, respectively, of the ipsilateral cortex (E, H, and K are enlarged from D, G, and J, respectively). Compared with PBS treatment, the positive staining of
Bielshowsky silver, NF-200, and synaptophysin significantly increased at day 14 after MCAo along the IBZ after naive MSC treatment. MiR133bþMSC treatment significantly increased, while miR-133bMSC treatment significantly decreased the positive staining area of Bielshowsky
silver, NF-200, and synaptophysin at day 14 after MCAo compared with naive MSC treatment. MCAo: MCAo rats administered with PBS,

of injected MSCs enter the brain which may facilitated by the
disruption of the blood-brain barrier [33, 67, 68]. The mechanisms underlying how the relatively few injected MSCs now
resident in brain drive the robust functional recovery after
stroke are not fully understood. Our prior in vitro studies
identified a new mechanism that may underlie the therapeutic
benefits of MSC-based therapies, that is, MSCs release exosomes that mediate the miRNA transfer from MSCs to parenchymal cells and thereby modulate the neural cell gene
expression and protein production which enhance neurite outgrowth [41]. In this in vivo study, we demonstrate for the first
time that, via exosome-enriched extracellular particles, the
therapeutic benefit of MSC treatment of stroke is mediated by
miRNA transfer, represented by miR-133b, to neural cells
which evoke neurite remodeling and brain plasticity and subsequently benefit functional recovery.
Our previous RT-PCR [41] and in situ hybridization
studies (Supporting Information figure) showed that miR133b levels in the IBZ of rats subjected to MCAo significantly increased after treatment with MSCs, and double immunostaining showed the miR-133b present in neurons and
astrocytes. This data show that miR-133b levels in the CSF
were correspondingly altered with the miR-133b level
changes in MSCs administered to rats. GFP-tagged
exosome experiments also confirmed that MSC exosomeenriched particles are present in neurons/astrocytes. In conjunction with our previous in vitro data that miR-133b is
mostly encapsulated within the MSC exosomes, and MSC
exosome treatment increased the miR-133b levels in neurons/astrocytes [41], this in vivo study thus indicates that
the transfer of miR-133b from MSCs to neurons/astrocytes

is likely mediated by exosomes. The question is how do
the exosomes released by MSCs enter the CSF? We consider the possibility that the exosomes produced by the
MSCs directly diffuse to the CSF, and thus the exosomes
containing miR-133b in the CSF, thereby directly reflect
those produced by the MSCs. In addition, we cannot
exclude the possibility that MSC exosomes stimulate endogenous miR-133b expression in neurons/astrocytes, and
are subsequently generated and released from these neural
cells and thereby also contribute to exosomes in the CSF
[67–69]. Further studies are warranted to directly trace the
source of miR-133b-enhanced exosomes in the CSF after
MSC treatment.
The production and composition of MSC released exosomes are affected by stroke and these exosomes mediate
the communication of MSCs and neural cells, modify the
neural cells, and promote the neurite outgrowth, which may
enhance functional recovery after stroke. Exosomes are
released by most cell types under physiological conditions,
and cellular stress conditions also affect the composition of
exosomes [69]. Although there is literature showing shortrange diffusion of exosomes [70] and a short half-life time
in serum due to possible circulation degradation or phagocytic clearance [71, 72], exosomes spread widely in the
brain and exogenous exosomes may be used as a delivery
vehicle [73, 74]. Development of gene therapy vehicles for
diffuse delivery to the brain is one of the major challenges
for clinical gene therapy applications. MSCs exhibit a degree
of ‘‘immune privilege’’ due to their ability to suppress Tcell-mediated responses for tissue rejection [75]. MSCs
escape immune system surveillance and survive in the CNS

downregulated by miR-133 [82, 89]. This data demonstrate
that the increase of miR-133b in astrocytes downregulated
CTGF expression, which is consistent with our previous
studies that MSC treatment reduced the thickness of the
glial scar [35, 38].
Inhibitory ligands bind to growth cone receptors, activating a Rho-family GTPase intracellular signaling pathway that
disrupts the actin cytoskeleton inducing growth cone collapse
and/or repulsion [90, 91]. The Rho family of small GTPases,
like RhoA, is a key regulator of the neuronal morphological
development, and adult neuronal structural changes require
actin cytoskeleton reorganization [92]. The 30 UTR of RhoA
mRNA contains several miRNA (including miR-133b) binding sites that make the miRNA-dependent silencing machinery reasonable [93, 94]. RhoA mRNA is localized to axons
and growth cones, and translation of RhoA is required for
growth cone collapse elicited by an axonal guidance cue,
Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) [95]. Sema3A-dependent growth
cone collapse is abolished by knockdown of axonal RhoA
mRNA [81]. In addition to its impact on axon growth and
guidance, RhoA also affects dendrite development and

from the CSF at day 14 after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo). Data show that MCAo decreased the miR-133b level in the
CSF exosomes. The miR-133b level in the CSF exosomes was significantly increased compared to the MCAo control after treatment with
naive MSCs. MiR-133bþMSC treatment significantly increased, while

even after transplantation of allogeneic [75] or xenogeneic
MSCs [76]. Because they may provide a continuous source
of released exosomes, MSCs are an ideal cell source of
exosomes for active biofactor delivery [77–79]. Thus, exogenous application of MSCs transfected with miR-133b or
other beneficial miRNAs warrants investigation as a treatment for stroke in rodent models. We expect that exosome
delivery of functional miRNAs further promotes neurite
outgrowth and functional recovery after stroke compared
with naive MSC treatment.
MiRNAs play key roles in development and appropriate
axonal path finding, a process that builds the circuitry of the
nervous system [80, 81]. In the injured CNS, the glial scar
represents a major impediment to axonal regeneration [38,
82, 83]. It is composed of extracellular matrix deposition
and astrogliosis (reactive astrocytes) [84]. Reactive astrocytes dramatically express CTGF [85–87], a major inhibitor
of axonal growth at injury sites in the CNS in mammals, and
its expression is elevated in plaques from stroke patients
[88]. The CTGF expression by reactive astrocytes is associated with matrix deposition and postlesional restructuring
[86] as well as the glial scar formation in human cerebral
infarction [85]. CTGF is a target of miR-133, and it is

plasticity. In studies in mosaic Drosophila brains, RhoA mutant neurons overextended their dendrites [96]. MiR-133
downregulates RhoA protein expression [97], and then enhances regrowth of the corticospinal tract after spinal cord injury
[98]. RhoA distinct localization in synapses and dendrite
microtubules has been confirmed by immunohistochemical
analyses and electron microscopy [99]. In this study, RhoA
expression was downregulated by the overexpression of miR133b which stimulates neurite outgrowth and improves functional recovery.
In HEK293T cells, overexpression of miR-146a selectively enhanced export of miR146a and did not alter the relative expression of endogenous and extracellular particle miRNAs [97]. Even so, we cannot exclude the possibility that
regulation of other miRNAs within the MSCs and their export
via exosomes may be affected by miR-133b overexpression.
The miRNA regulation is a network system [13, 98], and the
transcription of miRNAs may be regulated [100, 101]. CTGF
and RhoA expression may also be controlled by other miRNAs in the neural cells affected by the transfer of miR-133b.
As a proof-of-concept study, we need to simplify the target.
However, the effects of MSC miR-133b overexpression upon
MSC exosome content and miRNAs changes in the recipient
cells warrant further study.
