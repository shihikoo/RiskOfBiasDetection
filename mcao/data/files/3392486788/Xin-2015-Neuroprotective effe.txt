a b s t r a c t
Acute inﬂammation plays an important role in the pathogenic progression of post-ischemic neuronal
damage. Apelin-13 has been investigated as a neuropeptide for various neurological disorders. The
present study was performed to evaluate the effects of apelin-13 on the inﬂammation of cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Transient focal I/R model in male Wistar rats were induced by 2 h
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24 h reperfusion. Rats then received treatment
with apelin-13 or vehicle after ischemia at the onset of reperfusion. The neurological deﬁcit was evaluated and the infarct volume was measured by TTC staining. The activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was
measured. The expression of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-␣ (TNF-␣),
interleukin-1␤ (IL-1␤), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were measured using real-time
PCR. And the expression of apelin receptor (APJ), ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba1), glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) were measured by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Our results demonstrated that treatment with apelin-13 in I/R rats markedly
reduced neurological deﬁcits and the infarct volume. The increase of MPO activity induced by I/R was
inhibited by apelin-13 treatment. The real-time PCR showed that apelin-13 decreased the expression of
inﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-1␤, TNF-␣ and ICAM-1 in I/R rats. The expression of APJ in I/R rats was
increased. And the expression of Iba1, GFAP and HMGB1 in I/R rats was decreased by apelin-13 treatment
indicating the inhibition of microglia, astrocytes and other inﬂammatory cells. In conclusion, apelin-13
is neuroprotective for neurons against I/R through inhibiting the neuroinﬂammation.

Introduction
Stroke is the second most common cause of death in developed countries and the most major cause of permanent disability
worldwide. Ischemic stroke, which accounts for approximately 87%
of stroke, often results from the occlusion of a cerebral artery
caused by a thrombus or embolus [10,11]. A growing body of data
implicates that inﬂammatory mechanisms play important roles

in the pathogenic progression of post-ischemic neuronal damage
[9,26,31].
Apelin is an endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor APJ [27], which is synthesized as a 77-amino acid prepropeptide.
Apelin is cleaved by proteases to yield signiﬁcantly shorter, biologically active forms including apelin-36, apelin-17 and apelin-13.
Among fragments, apelin-13 and apelin-36 are associated with
cytoprotection. Apelin-13 is shown to speciﬁcally bind to APJ receptor with a high afﬁnity and elicits greater degrees of biological
potency than apelin-36 or apelin-17. The C-terminal 13 amino acids
are completely conserved across all species [20,30].
The established biological effects of apelin have been shown
to be involved in major cardiovascular actions, neoangiogenesis,
immunologic modulation and body ﬂuid homeostasis. Recently, the
apelin/APJ system has been investigated as a neuroprotective regulator for various neurological disorders [5]. Recently, it has been
shown that apelin-36 has protective effects on cerebral ischemia
reperfusion (I/R) injury by decreasing neurological deﬁcits and

suppressing apoptosis [12]. In addition, pretreatment with apelin13 reduces brain injuries and post-ischemic cerebral edema
through blocking programmed cell death [16]. Moreover, there is a
positive correlation between tumor necrosis factor-␣ (TNF-␣) and
apelin in human and mouse adipose tissue [7]. Apelin prevents
aortic aneurysm formation by decreasing macrophage burden, as
well as inhibiting proinﬂammatory cytokine and chemokine activation [22]. This evidence suggests the involvement of this peptide
in inﬂammation. The effects of apelin-13 on the neuroinﬂammation
in ischemic brain need to be further explored.
Materials and methods

coronal slices starting at 1 mm from the frontal pole, which were
immediately incubated for 30 min in a freshly prepared PBS (pH 7.4)
solution containing 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
(Sigma, St Louis, MO) at 37 ◦ C in the dark. Stained sections were
then ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Both hemispheres of each
stained coronal section were scanned using a high-resolution scanner and analyzed by ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).
Brieﬂy, infarct areas of all sections were calculated to get total
infarct area which was multiplied by thickness of brain sections
to obtain the volume of infarction. To eliminate the effect of brain
edema, the infarct volume was calculated with the following formula: infarct volume = (red area of contralateral side − red area of
ipsilateral side)/total area × 100% [21].

Animal model
Measurement of cerebral myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity
The experimental procedures of animal were approved by the
Commission of Jining Medical University for ethics of experiments
on animals and were conducted in accordance with international
standards. All animals were housed conventionally in a constant
temperature (22–26 ◦ C) and humidity (50–60%) animal room with
a 12-h-light–dark cycle and allowed free access to food and water.
Male Wistar rats (280–320 g) were purchased from LuKang Company (Jining, Shangdong, PR China). Rats were randomly divided
into 3 groups: (1) sham-operated group: rats were obtained by
inserting the ﬁlament into the common carotid artery, but without advancing it to the middle cerebral artery; (2) I/R group: rats
were subjected to 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24-h reperfusion by the intraluminal ﬁlament technique
as described. Rats received saline (0.9% NaCl, 10 ␮l per rat) after
ischemia at the onset of reperfusion; (3) apelin-13 group: rats were
operated in the same way as rats in I/R group, Rats then received
treatment with apelin-13 (50 ng/kg, 10 ␮l per rat) after ischemia at
the onset of reperfusion. Rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg) [17,19]. During
and after the surgery, the perianal temperature was maintained
at 37 ◦ C with a heating pad until the complete recovery of the animals from the anesthesia. All efforts were made to minimize animal
suffering and reduce the numbers of animals used.
Intracerebroventricular administration of apelin-13
Apelin-13 was obtained from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and
dissolved in 0.9% saline. Apelin-13 (50 ng/kg), or the same volume
of saline was administered intracerebroventricularly to rats in a
volume of 10 ␮l per rat at the onset of reperfusion after ischemia.
The stereotaxic coordinates from the bregma were: 0.8 mm posterior to bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to the midline and 3.8 mm ventral
to the skull surface [28]. Apelin-13 or 0.9% saline was injected at
2 ␮l/min for 5 min. Needle was stayed for further 5 min after the
end of injection to minimize leakage of drug.
Neurological scoring
Neurological test was performed by investigators blinded to
group assignment at 24 h after reperfusion using the Longa Score
Scale [23]: 0 = no neurologic deﬁcit, 1 = failure to extend left
forepaw fully, 2 = circling to the left, 3 = falling to the left, and
4 = being unable to walk spontaneously and having a depressed
level of consciousness. The animals, received a score in the range
1–3, were used for further treatment.
Infarct volume measurement
Rats were subjected to 2 h MCAO and killed 24 h after reperfusion and the brains chilled at −20 ◦ C for 20 min to harden the
tissue. Using a rat brain matrix, each brain was cut into ﬁve 2 mm

MPO activity was evaluated after 24 h of reperfusion. MPO activity is used as an indicator of neutrophils inﬁltration in cerebral
ischemia process [2]. MPO activity was determined by a commercial assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China).
The quantitative procedure was carried out according to the recommendations of detection kit. Brieﬂy, the ischemic penumbra
obtained 24 h after reperfusion were homogenized in cool normal
saline (ischemic penumbra:normal saline = 1:10). The absorbance
of the reaction product was recorded at 460 nm spectrophotometrically and the enzyme activity was expressed in units, where 1
unit represents the amount of enzyme degrading 1 ␮mol/L H2 O2
per minute. Units of activity were normalized to 1 g of protein.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was extracted from ischemic penumbra after 24 h
of reperfusion using TRIzol reagent (Tiangen Biotechnology, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse
transcription was performed using the Revert AidTM First Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The expression of the mRNA was analyzed using the
SYBR Green real-time PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was carried out in 96well plates using the Roche LightCycler 480 (LC480). The primers
were synthesized by Shanghai Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China.
The sequences of rat interleukin-1␤ (IL-1␤), TNF-␣, intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and ␤-actin primers were as following: IL-1␤, forward: 5 -aggacccaagcaccttcttt-3 and reverse: 5 agacagcacgaggcattttt-3 ; TNF-␣, forward: 5 -tgcctcagcctcttctcatt-3
and reverse: 5 -cccatttgggaacttctcct-3 ; ICAM-1, forward: 5 tggggttggagactaactgg-3 and reverse: 5 -gtgccacagttctcaaagca-3 ;
␤-actin, forward: 5 -ctcagttgctgaggagtccc-3 and reverse: 5 attcgagagaagggagggct-3 . ␤-actin was ampliﬁed in parallel as the
internal control. Each tissue sample of rats was run in triplicate
and each reaction volume was 20 ␮l. PCR cycling conditions were:
95 ◦ C for 10 min, 40 cycles of ampliﬁcation at 95 ◦ C for 15 s, and 60 ◦ C
for 1 min. Subsequently, a dissociation program was applied with
one cycle at 95 ◦ C for 15 s, 60 ◦ C for 1 min and 95 ◦ C for 15 s. Gene
expression data were initially expressed as CP values, the number of
cycles required for the quantity of DNA to reach some preset value.
CP was calculated for every sample, and the expression levels
were indicated with 2−Cp .
Immunohistochemistry
Immediately after 24 h of reperfusion, the animals were deeply
anesthetized and transcardially perfused with saline, followed by
4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were removed and post-ﬁxed in
the same ﬁxative at 4 ◦ C for 24 h. The sections were immunolabeled for APJ, Iba-1 (a marker for microglia/macrophages), GFAP (a

Q. Xin et al. / Peptides 63 (2015) 55–62

marker for astrocytes) or HMGB1. Brieﬂy, the slides were incubated
with rabbit polyclonal anti-APJ (1:200, Biorbyt), rabbit polyclonal
anti-Iba1 (1:1000, WAKO), rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (1:1000,
Abcam), or rabbit polyclonal anti-HMGB1 (1:200, Cell Signaling)
overnight at 4 ◦ C, followed by incubation in the secondary goat
anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min, and an avidin–biotin horseradish peroxidase (HRP) complex (Zhongshan Golden Bridge Inc., Beijing,
China) for 15 min at 37 ◦ C. The sections were then incubated in
diaminobenzidine to visualize the HRP activity. The reactions were
terminated once an optimal contrast between speciﬁc cellular and
nonspeciﬁc background labeling was reached. The sections from
each treatment group were processed simultaneously. For negative controls, the primary antibodies were replaced by PBS. We
randomly obtained ﬁve visual ﬁeld images from every section to
evaluate total numbers of APJ, Iba1, GFAP and HMGB1-positive
cells in the ischemic penumbra using an Olympus IX 71 inverted
microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Western blot
Total proteins were extracted from ischemic penumbra after
24 h of reperfusion using a kit from the Keygen Institute of Biotechnology (Keygen, Nanjing, China). Equal amounts of protein per lane
(50 ␮g) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were
transferred onto a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membrane
(Roche). The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk/0.1%
Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline for 2 h at 37 ◦ C. Thereafter,
the membrane was incubated with different primary antibodies, including rabbit anti-APJ (1:1000, Biorbyt), rabbit anti-Iba1
(1:1000, WAKO), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:5000, Abcam) and rabbit antiHMGB1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 ◦ C. Subsequently,
the membrane was treated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled
secondary antibody (1:5000, Zhongshan Golden Bridge Inc.,
Beijing, China) for 1 h at 37 ◦ C. A rabbit anti-␤-actin antibody
(1:5000, Zhongshan Golden Bridge Inc., Beijing, China) was used
as a loading control. The blots were visualized using ECL reagent
kits (MultiSciences, Hangzhou, China) and the optical density of
the lanes was quantiﬁed using ImageJ software.

Table 1.
Apelin-13 decreased infarct volume after cerebral I/R
Rats after I/R insult exhibited marked infarct volume as is shown
in Fig. 1, TTC staining of the serial coronal brain section showed
42.833 ± 3.884% infarct area in I/R group. In contrast, administration of apelin-13 at 50 ng/kg signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume
by 35.945 ± 4.116% (P = 0.001) (Tables 2–4).
Apelin-13 reduced MPO activity after cerebral I/R
In this present work, we performed a MPO activity assay to
explore the role of apelin-13 in attenuating neutrophils inﬁltration

in the ischemic penumbra (Fig. 2). MPO activity was signiﬁcantly
higher in the I/R group than that in the sham group. The increased
MPO activity was signiﬁcantly reduced by treatment with apelin-13
after I/R injury (P < 0.001).
Apelin-13 inhibited the expression of inﬂammatory cytokines
after cerebral I/R
As shown in Fig. 3, the levels of these inﬂammatory mediators including IL-1␤, TNF-␣ and ICAM-1 were markedly elevated
in I/R group compared with sham group, while administration of
apelin-13 after the onset of reperfusion signiﬁcantly decreased
the induction of these cytokines (P < 0.001), indicating that the
neuroprotective role of apelin-13 on cerebral I/R injury might be
attributed to its suppressive effects on neuroinﬂammation.

Apelin-13 up-regulated the expression of APJ, down-regulated the
expression of Iba1, GFAP and HMGB1
In order to examine the effect of I/R on the apelin/APJ system, we
examined the expression of APJ in the ischemic penumbra. Interestingly, we found that APJ+ cells were signiﬁcantly higher in the
ischemic penumbra of I/R rats than those in sham-operated rats,
while administration of apelin-13 could further increase numbers
of APJ+ cells (Fig. 4a and e). To further investigate the antiinﬂammatory effects of apelin-13 in the post-ischemic brain, the
activation of microglia and astrocytes and the expression of HMGB1
were examined by immunohistochemistry staining. The number of
both Iba1+ cells and GFAP+ cells were signiﬁcantly higher in the I/R
group but they were signiﬁcantly decreased in the apelin-13 group
(Fig. 4b, c, f and g). The expression of HMGB1 in the cytoplasm was
counted. As shown in Fig. 4d and h, the HMGB1+ cells increased
obviously after cerebral I/R injury, which could be signiﬁcantly
inhibited by apelin-13 treatment (P < 0.001).
We further analyzed the protein levels of APJ, Iba1, GFAP and
HMGB1 in ischemic penumbra by western blot (Fig. 5). As shown

in Fig. 5, the level of APJ protein in I/R group was higher than that in
sham group in cytosolic fractions. Treatment with apelin-13 could
further increase the protein expression of APJ. In addition, the overexpression of Iba1, GFAP and HMGB1 induced by I/R injury was also
decreased by apelin-13 (P ≤ 0.001).
Discussion
Recently, the apelin/APJ system has been investigated as a neuroprotective regulator for various neurological disorders. It has
been reported that central application of apelin-13 exerts protective effects against cerebral damage and brain edema via preventing
apoptosis in a transient model of focal stroke in rats [16]. There is
clear evidence suggests that inﬂammation plays an important role
in the evolution of brain injury after cerebral ischemia reperfusion
[3,6].
In this study, we found apelin-13 elicited neuroprotective roles
by alleviating the post-ischemic inﬂammation in sub-acute phase.
We found that rats after I/R insult exhibited serious neurological
dysfunction and large brain infarct. In contrast, administration of
apelin-13 signiﬁcantly decreased the neurological dysfunction and
infarct size induced by I/R.
MPO activity has been used as a distinct indicator for the tissue
inﬁltration of neutrophilic granulocytes [4]. The early accumulating neutrophils are reported to cause brain edema and to be one
of the vital cellular targets to elicit neuroprotection during the
early post-ischemic period [1]. In the present study, the activity
of MPO was signiﬁcantly increased in response to I/R insult, which
was markedly inhibited by apelin-13 treatment. The reduction of

neutrophils inﬁltration might be one of the neuroprotective mechanisms of apelin-13.
It has been demonstrated that pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
including TNF-␣ and IL-1␤ are markedly up-regulated in the
ischemic region after cerebral ischemia. Subsequently, these mediators enhance the expression of cell adhesion molecules including
ICAM-1 and endothelium selectin (E-selectin) on endothelial cells

and leukocytes, and facilitate the adhesion and transendothelial
migration of leukocytes [14,24]. The accumulation of inﬂammatory
cytokines in stroke does not appear to be a mere consequence of the
degenerative processes, but it appears to play a role in the cascade
of events inducing neuronal death by stress-activated signal transduction pathways. Consistent with previous ﬁndings, we found
that the production of IL-1␤, TNF-␣ and ICAM-1 was signiﬁcantly

increased in response to ischemic injury, which could be effectively
suppressed by apelin-13. Therefore, we presume that the mechanism responsible for the anti-inﬂammatory effects of apelin-13
may be related to the suppression of pro-inﬂammatory mediators.
In the central nervous system (CNS), apelin and APJ are known
to be expressed in the hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum and
hypothalamus [8,25]. In order to examine the effect of I/R on
the apelin/APJ system, we examined the expression of APJ in the
ischemic penumbra. Interestingly, we found that APJ expression
was signiﬁcantly increased after cerebral I/R injury. Administration
of apelin-13 could further induce APJ expression, thus we proposed that APJ overexpression induced by I/R may be one of the
mechanisms to assess the role of apelin-13 as a post-conditioning
mimetic.
A substantial body of literature supports the notion that
microglia contribute to the evolution of brain injury following
ischemia, serving as a principle source of inﬂammatory factors in
acute phase injury [33,34]. Activated microglia are known to release
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and increase neuronal death by producing potentially neurotoxic substances like prostaglandin E2
(PGE2), nitric oxide, oxygen radicals, as well as proteolytic enzymes
[15,36].

Astrocytes are the most numerous glia in the CNS, which
play essential roles in the physiology and pathology of CNS. Like
microglia, astrocytes are capable of secreting inﬂammatory factors such as cytokines and chemokines, which exacerbate brain
injury. Reactive astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells can
express matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) after injury, which subsequently leads to the blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown [18]. In
the present study, cerebral I/R injury induced a notable increase
in the expression of Iba1 and GFAP in the ischemic penumbra,
based on immunostaining analysis and western blot. However,
the expression of Iba1 and GFAP was signiﬁcantly inhibited in the
apelin-13-treated group. These results indicate apelin-13 can suppress the activation of microglia and astrocytes.
HMGB1 is an endogenous danger signal molecule, which can
be actively released into the cytoplasm by activated microglia,
myeloid dendritic cells, and natural killer cells [13,32]. HMGB1 has
been characterized as a cytokine-like mediator that plays a critical role in the development of post-ischemic cerebral injury by the
ampliﬁcation of plural inﬂammatory response [29,35]. An important ﬁnding of the present study is that the expression of HMGB1 is
signiﬁcantly increased in the I/R group and treatment with apelin13 can decrease its expression.

In conclusion, this study provides evidence that the endogenous expression of apelin/APJ system and their interactions
suggests neuroprotective signal transduction in the CNS. Apelin13’s inhibitory inﬂuence prevents the post-ischemic inﬂammation
in sub-acute phase. These ﬁndings support the concept that cerebral apelin-13 could be explored as a possible target for novel
therapeutic approaches to ameliorate inﬂammation, the ﬁrst acute
event in brain injury induced by I/R.
