data in a model of transient MCAO in rats. ADC images were obtained before, during MCAO and
after 60 min of reperfusion. Probability histograms were generated using ADC data obtained
either during MCAO, after reperfusion, or both combined. The results were compared to real
infarct volumes, i.e.T2 maps obtained at day 7. Assessment of the performance of the
estimations showed better results combining ADC data obtained during occlusion and at
reperfusion. Therefore, ADC data alone can provide sufﬁcient information for a reasonable
prediction of infarct volume if the MRI information is obtained both during the occlusion and
soon after reperfusion. This approach can be used to check whether drug administration after
MRI acquisition can change infarct volume prediction.

Introduction

The rat intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)/
reperfusion model is broadly used in preclinical studies of
stroke (Macrae, 1992; McAuley, 1995). However, several factors
account for a rather high degree of inter-animal variability in
infarct volumes after transient intraluminal MCAO. The strain
(Aspey et al., 2000; Oliff et al., 1995; Prieto et al., 2005; Walberer
et al., 2006) and age of the animals (Sutherland et al., 1996), the
surgical method (Huang et al., 1999; Zarow et al., 1997), surgical
interventions causing infarction in territories of the internal
(Kanemitsu et al., 2002) or external (Dittmar et al., 2003) carotid
arteries, the extent of collateral circulation (Dittmar et al.,
2003) and the efﬁcacy of reperfusion contribute to infarct
volume variability. This variability between animals can certainly be a source of bias when the effects of treatments are
evaluated. Therefore, identiﬁcation of the acute lesion and
prediction of the subsequent fate of the ischemic tissue would
help to compare treatment groups more accurately.
Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is nowadays widely available in experimental research and it is an
excellent tool for imaging brain damage in ischemia. Various
imaging techniques are used to obtain predictive information
in experimental stroke (Farr and Wegener, 2010), among
which perfusion- and diffusion-weighted MRI are the most
useful techniques for detecting signs of acute brain ischemia.
Prediction using critical thresholds over apparent diffusion
coefﬁcient (ADC) or cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) maps is used in
human stroke (Arenillas, 2002; Thomalla et al., 2003). More
complex algorithms have been developed to predict tissue
fate in experimental animal studies that are based on a
generalized linear model (Wu et al., 2007), the probability of
infarct (Shen et al., 2005), improved iterative self-organizing
data-analysis algorithm (Lu et al., 2005; Shen and Duong,
2008), and artiﬁcial neural network (Huang et al., 2010) or

support vector machine (Huang et al., 2011). These methods
provide a reasonably accurate prediction of the ﬁnal infarct
volume determined by T2 MRI or histology one or more days
after MCAO. However, many of these algorithms are quite
complex to implement and they use multimodal MRI information by combining perfusion and diffusion data, among
other parameters. Nevertheless, ADC maps seem to provide
valuable information for adequate prediction of the ﬁnal
tissue outcome, particularly in models with reperfusion
(Bråtane et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2010; Leithner et al., 2011;
Rosso et al., 2011), and they can be easily obtained. Previous
predictive studies used permanent MCAO or transient MCAO,
but for the latter they used information acquired after
reperfusion while they did not use MRI during ischemia.
In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the value of
acute ADC maps to predict infarct volume after MCAO/
reperfusion in the Wistar rat. We measured ADC during
MCAO and shortly after reperfusion since recovery of ADC
has been reported after transient ischemia (Ringer et al.,
2001).

ADC and T2 Maps

For each subject, we constructed several maps with the ADC
data obtained during MCAO and after reperfusion and with the
ﬁnal infarct volume determined from the T2 map at day 7.
These maps are shown for individual rats (numbered 1 to 11) in
Fig. 1. Group A (upper row) (rats 1 to 5) is the group used to
compute the probability histograms and group B (bottom row)
(rats 6 to 11) is the test group (see Section 5). During MCAO
(Fig. 1A), all rats showed a decay of the ADCocc values in the
right hemisphere and a corresponding increase in the relative
ADC (rADC) values. In all cases the affected volume (see Table 1)

Mean and 95% conﬁdence interval for the infarct volume, as calculated with the different probability histograms and with the T2 mask at day
7. In addition, values for the relative error and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the different estimations are, compared with the ﬁnal

corresponded to less than 10% of the whole brain volume and
no statistically signiﬁcant differences were found between the
affected volumes of groups A and B.
After reperfusion (Fig. 1B) several behaviors were observed
in the rADCrep maps compared to the corresponding rADCocc maps. In 5 out of the 11 rats there was a noticeable
recovery of rADCrep values (e.g. rats 2 and 10), while in the
other cases the rADCrep values either did not change in
relation to the values during MCAO (e.g. rats 1 and 6) or they
increased (i.e. progressive ADC decrease) in the zone of the
infarct core (e.g. rats 4 and 7).
Fig. 1C shows the ﬁnal infarct for each rat as the difference
in the T2 maps (ΔT2) between the basal values before MCAO
and 7 days after MCAO. The ΔT2 maps were used to draw the
masks shown in Fig. 1D. These masks identiﬁed the voxels
corresponding to ﬁnal infarcted tissue. For the rats of group
A, this information was then used to compute the probability
histograms. Finally, the infarct mask of each rat was compared to the result of the different estimations obtained with
the probability histograms (see below).

2.2.

Probability histograms

Normalized histograms (Fig. 2) showing the distribution of
rADCocc and rADCrep values were obtained with all the rats
of group A. These combined histograms are obtained considering all the values of group A rats joined in one data set.
The distribution curve for rADCocc (Fig. 2A) reached a maximum at value 0, which indicates no differences between
ADC values during MCAO and the corresponding basal ADC.
Both sides of the curve correspond to the points deviating
from this exact correspondence to the basal prescan values.
The left side of the curve illustrates the deviation from the
theoretical prescan value due to natural variability in the

process of matching two images taken at different time
points (this variation does not exceed 20%). However, the
right side of the curve, instead of being symmetrical to the
left side, shows a lateral lobe, corresponding to increased
rADC values, between 0.2 and 0.6 (i.e. ADC values showing
decline during MCAO). The difference between the areas of
the left and right side of the distribution is proportional to the
number of ischemic voxels. After reperfusion (Fig. 2A), the
right lobe was less pronounced than during MCAO and there
was a shift of the main peak from 0, resulting in a less
asymmetric distribution than during MCAO. The distribution
of the infarcted voxels during occlusion was within the rADC
range from 0.2 to 0.6 (with a maximum around 0.4), whereas
after reperfusion the distribution of the infarcted voxels was
more uniform and had a wider range, from values of  0.1 to
over 0.6.
The probability distributions of infarct were calculated by
dividing the number of infarcted voxels by the number of all the
voxels for each rADC value of the histograms. Fig. 2B shows the
probability distributions with either the rADCocc or rADCrep
values. Then, a two-dimensional (2d) rADC distribution was
obtained, using group A rats, by combining the information of
the rADCocc and the rADCrep for all the brain voxels and for
the infarcted voxels. The ratio between these two distributions
provided a two-dimensional probability histogram, as shown in
Fig. 3A. All the probability histograms that were generated can
be used as look-up tables for a subsequent rat to obtain the
probability of infarction for each brain voxel.
To check the results of the 2d-probability histograms
obtained with the information from the rats in group A, we
generated an additional probability histogram that included
the rats in group B (n¼ 6) (Fig. 3B). The distribution in this new
histogram was very similar to the one obtained with the rats
in group A (Fig. 3A), i.e. rADC values had an equivalent

probability of infarction in both distributions, and the area
with the highest probability of infarction was equally located
on the top right for equivalent rADC values. The main
difference between the two probability maps was the size of
the different areas, indicating a slightly different range of
rADC values due to the difference among the experimental
groups used. Therefore, the probability distribution shown in
Fig. 3A seems to be a suitable distribution for all the rats of
both groups and can be used as a look-up table to estimate
the ﬁnal infarct volume of a given rat from its ADC values
obtained during and after MCAO.

2.3.

Infarct volume estimation

The probability histograms computed with group A were then
used as look-up tables to obtain probability maps of the brain

volume from where the estimated infarct volume for all the rats
(n¼ 11) was calculated. For this purpose, we used the various
histograms generated in the study: (1) the histogram with the
information from rADCocc only (prob-1d-occ, Fig. 4A); (2) the
histogram with the information of rADCrep only (prob-1d-rep,
Fig. 4B); and (3) the 2d probability histogram that uses the
combination of both rADCocc and rADCrep values (prob-2d,
Fig. 4C). These probability maps illustrate the location of the
infarct, and the higher or lower probability values could be
interpreted as an indication of the degree of ischemia at each
voxel. The main difference between the ﬁrst two histograms
(prob-1d-occ and prob-1d-rep) is that the predicted infarct
volume was smaller when only the values after reperfusion
were considered. However, in the latter case (prob-1d-rep), the
probability of infarct within the core area had higher values than
when using the values during occlusion (prob-1d-occ). In the

case of prob-2d, the volume with the highest probability of
infarct was similar to the one obtained using data during
occlusion (prob-1d-occ), but the probability values within the
infarct core were closer to the ones obtained with the values
after reperfusion (prob-1d-rep).
To estimate the infarct volume ﬁrst a probability threshold
for each rat of the A group was obtained to minimize the
difference between the estimated and real infarct volumes.
Then the mean of these probability thresholds for the group A
of rats was used to predict the infarct volume for all the rats,
selecting which voxels are infarcted or not. The predicted

infarct volume was calculated by adding all the voxels marked
as infarcted using the probability threshold. Fig. 5 shows the
infarct volume (in mm3) estimated using the probabilities
obtained with the relative ADC values during occlusion, after
reperfusion and both combined. The fact that the infarct
volume estimation for rats of group A is neither perfect is
explained considering that both the probability histogram and
the probability threshold used are obtained from an average of
several rats and not just from one, therefore the averaged
values may differ from the values of each particular case, and
the estimation would differ from the ideal case.

probabilities during occlusion (Prob 1d occlusion), at reperfusion (Prob 1d reperfusion) and both combined (Prob 2d).

To assess whether the various probability maps provided
correct estimations of the ﬁnal infarct volume, we compared for
each rat the estimated infarct volumes to the actual infarct
volume obtained from the masks of the T2 maps at day 7. Overall,
the predicted volume was slightly over-estimated when it was
obtained using either 1d probability during occlusion (prob-1d-occ)
or 2d probability (prob-2d). By contrast, the estimation of the
predicted volume was worse when obtained using only the values
after reperfusion (prob-1d-rep). This latter effect is due to the
partial ADC recovery after reperfusion, which makes distinction
between infarcted and non infarcted voxels less accurate, and the
deviation from the predicted volumes increases.
The averages and 95% conﬁdence interval (95%CI) for
infarct volume estimations in the different rat groups and
the various estimation methods, and the ﬁnal infarct volume
measured using the T2 mask at day 7, together with the
comparisons with the infarct volume predicted using the
probability histograms, are shown in Table 1. The differences
between the infarct volume estimations from ADC maps and
the real T2 measurements are given in Table 1 as the average
relative error and as the root mean square error (RMSE) for
the different rat groups and probabilities used. The Table also
shows the correlation coefﬁcients R2, and the average and
95%CI of the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the volumes
estimated for each group. The ﬁnal column indicates the
probability threshold used.
The sensitivity using prob-1d-rep with group B is too low,
and makes this predicting method not reliable. However, with
the 2d probability (prob-2d) smaller errors were obtained and
the correlation was better than with either of the 1d probabilities. Also the sensitivity was higher with the prob-2d
than the prob-1d-rep in all the cases.
To illustrate the errors in volume estimation for the
individual rats we measured the difference (computed as a
distance) between the mean rADC value in the ischemic zone
at occlusion and the corresponding value at reperfusion. For
each rat, we plotted this value against the corresponding real

infarct volume (T2 mask) (Fig. 6), and represented the relative
error in infarct volume estimation by the size of the circle
representing each value (black circles indicate rats of group A,
and white circles indicate rats of group B). We identiﬁed 4 rats
out of 11 with a high difference between the mean rADC
value at occlusion and that at reperfusion (difference 40.15),
and small infarct sizes (ﬁnal infarct volumeo100 mm3). Three
of the 4 rats with bad prediction belong to the group B, and
two of them behave as outliers since they had a very high
difference between the mean rADC value at occlusion and
that at reperfusion (40.3). Therefore, it seems that the
prediction loses accuracy when there is a high change in
the mean values of the ADC from occlusion to reperfusion. To
check whether this effect was due to speciﬁc features of
group A, we also reversed the model using probability
histogram of group B (Fig. 3B) to perform the prediction for
all rats. By doing this, the relative errors of the group A
increased, and they decreased in some rats of group B.
However, the two rats of group B with the highest mean
rADC difference between occlusion and reperfusion (Fig. 6)
still had high relative errors. Therefore, regardless of the
reference group used for the estimation, a high difference in
mean rADC between occlusion and reperfusion seems to
impair the predictive value of the model.

3.

Discussion

In this study we provide a method for infarct volume prediction using MRI data obtained within the ﬁrst hours after
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in rats. Infarct volume predictions were carried out from the ADC maps obtained at two
time points, during and after MCAO, by using the ADC data
either separately or combined. These maps are transformed
into relative values using an ADC map obtained before MCAO.
It seems possible to obtain relative values of ADC using other
techniques; one possibility might be to use the contra-lateral

hemisphere values. Measuring CBF can increase the quality
of infarct volume estimations (Huang et al., 2010), but
requires more acquisitions for the evaluation. The techniques
for CBF quantiﬁcation in rodents may not be widely available
in different laboratories, or might not be sufﬁciently accurate
due to low spatial resolution. Using the ADC data only, the
sensitivity and speciﬁcity are slightly lower than when CBF
data are included (Huang et al., 2010). However, the performance of the current estimations is comparable to those
obtained using other methods with more complex and timeconsuming algorithms (Huang et al., 2011, 2010), which could
be a limitation for their practical application in many experimental laboratories. Here, using ADC data only, we found
that the sensitivity was 70% and the speciﬁcity 93% when
information obtained during MCAO and after reperfusion was
used for the estimations. The mean relative error of the
infarct volume estimation by using the information from
rADC data during MCAO and after reperfusion (35%) is also
lower than the relative error obtained only considering the
mean infarct volume of group A as predicted volume for all
group B rats (50%).
The prediction method used here is based on probability
histograms created in a group of rats that were used as lookup tables for infarct estimation in other rats. Voxel-by-voxel
comparisons were carried out after a registration process to
ensure the correspondence between acquisitions. Non-rigid
registrations were chosen to account for the fact that the
lesion could displace the brain midline due to the presence of
edema, since this effect modiﬁes the internal geometry of the
brain. We showed that the averaged result obtained from a
set of rats could be reliably used to estimate the infarct
volume of other rats subjected to the same experimental
ischemia model. Since the procedure used here avoids the
need to perform manual segmentation to evaluate the ﬁnal
infarct volume, the variability introduced by different users is

prevented and infarct volume prediction could be systematized easily.
In general, the ﬁnal infarct volume was better estimated by
using the combined ADC data than by using only the information
from a single time point. The estimation seems to be reasonably
good in most of the rats excepting for those showing a large
difference (40.3) between the mean rADC value at occlusion and
that at reperfusion. Therefore, it seems that a big variation in the
intensity of the ADC from occlusion to reperfusion impairs the
estimation of infarct volume with this method. This variation
might not be a frequent phenomenon, but taking it into account
could contribute to assess the accuracy of the ﬁnal volume
estimation. In general, the prediction based on ‘ADC at reperfusion only’ is the one that differs more from the ﬁnal infarct
volume showing that a partial ADC recovery makes the estimated
lesion at reperfusion less accurate. This corroborates earlier
ﬁndings showing that reversal of ADC at early reperfusion does
not invariably indicate ﬁnal tissue viability (Neumann-Haefelin
et al., 2000; Ringer et al., 2001; Rojas et al., 2006).
Overall, the simpliﬁed prediction method reported here
can provide evidence to show that the expected infarct
volume is similar in different experimental groups. Then,
the infarct volumes estimated could be compared to the ﬁnal
infarct volumes to evaluate whether treatments carried out
after reperfusion may change the course of the prediction.

Summary

This study showed the usefulness of ADC data at early stages
during and after MCAO to estimate ﬁnal infarct volume in
rats. We compared the use of input ADC data at two time
points (during MCAO and after reperfusion), either individually or combined. We computed the probability histograms in
a group of rats, which were subsequently used as look-up

176

brain research 1583 (2014) 169–178

tables to carry out infarct estimation in a different group of
rats. The accuracy of the infarct estimation was quantitatively evaluated by comparing it with the ﬁnal infarct volume
obtained from the T2 maps at day 7. Performance measurements showed better results by using information of the ADC
during occlusion combined with the ADC after reperfusion,
rather than by separately using either the occlusion or
reperfusion data. In conclusion, we provide a simpliﬁed
method, based on ADC maps obtained during and after
transient ischemia, to predict ﬁnal infarct volumes in a stroke
model of 90 min intraluminal MCAO in rats.

Experimental procedure

5.1.

Animals and surgery

The study was carried out in 11 adult male Wistar rats (Charles
River, Lyon, France), weighing 250–300 g. Rats were housed in
cages with controlled temperature (2171 1C) and humidity
(55710%), under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and with food and
water available ad libitum. All experiments were performed in
accordance with the local legislation (Decret 214/1997 of July 30th
by the ‘Departament d’Agricultura, Ramaderia i Pesca de la
Generalitat de Catalunya’) under the approval of the Ethical
Committee of the University of Barcelona (CEEA), and in compliance with European legislation.
The surgery for intraluminal MCAO was carried out under
isoﬂurane anesthesia, as previously described (Pérez-Asensio
et al., 2010). The right MCA was occluded for 90 min. Then the
thread was removed and reperfusion was allowed. This
period of MCAO usually leads to striatal and cortical damage,
but in some cases only striatal infarction is observed. Cortical
brain perfusion was assessed by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry and
in all the cases occlusion induced a perfusion drop. The
perfusion values normalized to the basal registry before
surgery (100%) were 32711% and 120751% (mean7SD),
during ischemia and reperfusion, respectively.

5.2.

Magnetic resonance imaging

MRI experiments were conducted on a 7T BioSpec 70/30
horizontal animal scanner (Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany), equipped with a 12 cm inner diameter actively
shielded gradient system (400 mT/m). The receiver coil was
a phased-array surface coil for rat brain. Animals were placed
in a supine position in a Plexiglas holder with a nose cone for
administering anesthetic gases (2% isoﬂurane in a mixture of
oxygen and N2O at a 30:70 ratio) and ﬁxed by a tooth bar, ear
bars and adhesive tape. Tripilot scans were carried out for
accurate positioning of the animal's head in the isocenter of
the magnet. MRI acquisitions were taken at 4 different time
points in each rat: before MCAO surgery as the basal scan
(prescan, ps), during MCAO (i.e. 60 min after starting the
occlusion, occ 60 m), 60 min after reperfusion (rep 60 m),
and 7 days after reperfusion (rep 7d).

5.2.1.

ADC maps

ADC scans were acquired during MCAO and 60 min after
reperfusion using a pulsed gradient spin echo sequence with

the following acquisition parameters: echo time TE ¼55.07
ms, repetition time TR¼6250 ms, with a total acquisition
time of 2 min 55 s, 6 b-values from 100 to 1000 s/mm2, a ﬁeld
of view FOV¼40  40  180 mm3, with a matrix size of
128  128  18 voxels and a resolution of 0.312  0.312  1
mm3/voxel. The same parameters were used for the basal
acquisition.

T2 relaxometry maps

T2 relaxometry scans were carried out 7 days after MCAO
with a multi-slice multi-echo acquisition sequence with 16
effective echo times ramping from 11 to 176 ms, TR¼4926 ms,
FOV ¼40  40  18 mm3, matrix size 256  256  18 voxels and
resolution 0.156  0.156  1 mm3/voxel. The same parameters
were used for the basal acquisition.

Data analysis

ADC and T2 maps were calculated using Paravision 5.0 software (Bruker BioSpin, Ettlingen, Germany). Later these maps
were processed with custom-made algorithms programmed
in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc, Natick, MA, USA) and ImageJ
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). A binary
mask was manually drawn over the T2 map in order to
segment the brain from the background in the different
acquisitions. Also, a threshold of 275 ms was applied to the
T2 maps to reduce the noise. Then, all the maps acquired at
different time points for each rat were co-registered to perform a voxel-based analysis.

5.3.1.

Registration process

A registration process was carried out for voxel-by-voxel
comparisons between volumes, ensuring correspondence
between the same points in images originally showing
altered volumes due to brain edema. Non-rigid registration
was performed by using Elastix 4.3 (Klein et al., 2010), a
program based on Insight Segmentation and Registration
Toolkit (ITK). The registration process used the basal scans
before surgery as the reference images, whereas the acquisitions after MCAO were used as the moving images. A
sequential registration, combining rigid and b-spline registrations, was carried out. Bilinear interpolation was performed
to allow correspondence between the various resolutions of
ADC and T2 maps. This interpolation also smoothed the
images, which was convenient for the subsequent
processing.

5.3.2.

ADC probability histogram

Following co-registration, ADC and T2 values at the various
time points were used to compute the probability histograms.
For each rat, the brain was segmented from the background
in all the images using the mask obtained from the basal T2
map. Then a uniform smoothing ﬁlter of 3  3 pixels was
applied to the original ADC and T2 maps. The relative values
of ADC obtained 60 min after MCAO (rADCocc) and ADC at
60 min of reperfusion (rADCrep) were calculated by normalizing to the basal ADC values (obtained before MCAO). The
ﬁnal infarct volume was determined from the difference
(ΔT2) between the T2 maps obtained 7 days after reperfusion

brain research 1583 (2014) 169–178

(T2rep 7d) and the corresponding basal T2 map obtained
before MCAO (T2ps).
For the relative ADC maps, Eq. (1) was used:
rADCx ¼ 1

ADCx
ADCps

ð1Þ

This calculation gives the relative difference of the ADC
values (rADC) for a given time point in relation to the basal
acquisition. rADC increases above 0 when the ADC value
decreases. A segmentation mask was manually applied to the
ΔT2 maps to select the voxels corresponding to infarcted
tissue taking as reference intensity differences in the image
above 20 ms to delimitate the affected area. This method was
chosen for the segmentation, instead of a threshold directly
applied to the T2rep 7d image, to avoid selecting noise areas
as false infarcted voxels.
With this data, a table was computed relating the rADCocc
and rADCrep values with the infarct at 7 days (ΔT2). Data
representation was carried out with two types of histograms
pooling data from a group of rats (group A, see below). First
showing the distributions of rADCocc and rADCrep values for
the whole brain, and secondly calculating such distributions
considering only the infarcted points. The histograms bins
were selected of a 0.02 span sampling of the rADC values
from  1 to 1. Afterwards, we obtained a probability histogram by dividing the histogram corresponding to the
infarcted points by that of the whole brain. Thus, the probability histogram illustrates the proportion of infarcted voxels
for each relative ADC value.
Two-dimensional histograms were obtained by combining
the information of the rADC at occlusion and after reperfusion. A histogram was built with rADCocc values in the x axis
and rADCrep values in the y axis and taking into account all
the voxels of the whole brain volume. A second histogram
was computed in a similar way, but only considering the
points that were marked as injured by the ΔT2 mask. From
the ratio of both histograms, a new two-dimensional probability histogram was generated showing the proportion of
infarcted points for each combination of rADC values. This 2d
histogram was also processed to optimize the probability
map. A median ﬁlter was applied on the two-dimensional
probability histogram to eliminate the isolated points of the
histogram. This procedure smoothed the probability map
providing a more continuous distribution and avoiding the
points representing only one speciﬁc rat and not an average
behavior. Considering that the median ﬁlter would also
smooth the average probability values, only a 3  3 median
ﬁlter was used in order to make these differences small and
no signiﬁcant.

5.3.3.

Data analysis

An anatomical probability volume was generated from the rADC
maps of each rat, using the probability histogram as a look-up
table to obtain an estimation of the ﬁnal infarct volume. The rats
used in the study were separated into two groups: group A
comprised the rats (rat 1 to rat 5) used to compute the global
probability histograms; and group B was the test group containing rats (rat 6 to rat 11) that were used for infarct estimation by
the general probability histograms obtained with the rats of
group A. To evaluate the performance of the different probability

177

histograms, we compared the estimated infarct volume with the
corresponding real infarct volume. We also performed a speciﬁcity and sensitivity analysis, which is useful for evaluating
different classiﬁers. The statistical analysis to compare rat
groups A and B was carried out with the Mann-Whitney test.
The Kruskal–Wallis test compared the results obtained from the
different probability histograms. When signiﬁcant overall differences were found, a post-hoc analysis was performed with
Dunn's multiple comparison test. All data were analyzed with
GraphPad (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA, USA) and differences
were considered signiﬁcant if po0.05.
