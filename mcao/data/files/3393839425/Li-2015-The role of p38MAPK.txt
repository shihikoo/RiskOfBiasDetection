It has been reported that remote ischemic postconditioning was able to protect from a harmful ischemia occurring in brain. In the present study, we investigated the role of p38 MAPK signal pathway in the process of neuroprotection and anti-apoptosis following remote limb ischemic postconditioning on rat focal cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) model. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided randomly into four groups: the shamoperated group, I/R group, limb ischemic postconditioning (LPostC) group, and LPostC + SB203580 (p38
MAPK inhibitor) group. Focal ischemia was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Limb ischemic
postconditioning was implemented by brief cycles of femoral artery occlusion. At 24 h after modeling, we analyzed the neurological deﬁcit score, assessed the cerebral tissue morphology by H-E staining, and evaluated neuronal apoptosis by TUNEL staining. The protein expression levels of p-p38 or p-ATF2 (phospho-activating
transcription factor 2) in the penumbra region were detected by western blotting or immunohistochemical staining. Our ﬁndings revealed that LPostC relieved cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by decreasing neurological
score, improving neuronal morphological changes in the ischemic penumbra area, and reducing neuronal apoptosis. In addition, LPostC or LPostC + SB203580 attenuated the increase in p-p38 and p-ATF2 levels in ischemia/reperfusion brain tissue. These results indicate that the protective effects of LPostC against cerebral I/R
injury may be related to the attenuation of neuronal apoptosis and the suppression of p38 MAPK-ATF2 pathway.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and morbidity
worldwide. Brain is extremely sensitive to hypoxia or hypoperfusion,
and the ischemic cascade is rapidly initiated within seconds to minutes
after the loss of blood ﬂow to a region of the brain. Surprisingly, in spite
of mitigating initial tissue hypoxia, the subsequent restoration of blood
ﬂow and reoxygenation is frequently associated with an exacerbation of
cerebral tissue injury [1,2]. This phenomenon is known as “reperfusion
injury”. Indeed, a wide range of pathological processes contribute to
ischemia/reperfusion injury, including energy failure, production of
oxygen free radicals, elevation of intracellular Ca2 + level, release of
excitatory neurotransmitters, sterile inﬂammation and apoptosis [3,4].
In recent decades, although many neuroprotective drugs have been
shown to markedly improve neurological functional deﬁcits in animal
models of stroke, only thrombolytic agents has been successfully

translated into clinical application [5,6]. Nowadays, growing data
suggested that non-pharmaceutical therapies might provide new
approaches for stroke [7–9]. Ischemic postconditioning (IPost), in
which repeated brief episodes of sublethal ischemia/reperfusion are
applied after lethal ischemic episode and during reperfusion, has
emerged as a promising method against I/R injury. One of the most notable breakthroughs in the ﬁeld came with the discovery that ischemic
postconditioning also could be applied at a distance in the same ischemic target organ or another remote organ [10,11]. The new strategy
termed remote ischemic postconditioning has also been shown to be
effective in reducing cerebral reperfusion injuries, although their mechanisms remain elusive.
Based on recent studies on the experiments in the brain, remote ischemic postconditioning probably trigger endogenous neuroprotective
mechanisms by acting on different proteins involved in ionic transport,
G protein-coupled receptors and kinase signaling pathways, reducing
apoptosis and free radical products, eliciting ischemic tolerance, and
ultimately attenuate neuronal damage [12,13].
In this study, we hypothesized that the neuroprotective effects
induced by remote ischemic postconditioning may be associated with
the regulation of apoptosis and inhibiting the action of p38 MAKP

signaling pathway. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the
neuroprotective effects of limb postconditioning on rat focal cerebral
I/R model, and to investigate the role of p38 MAKP signaling pathway
in the protective effects.
2. Materials and methods

the obtained femoral arteries were occluded for 10 min and then
opened for 10 min for a total of 3 cycles. At the same time, the ﬁlament was withdrawn from internal carotid artery to perform reperfusion for 24 h. In the LPostC + SB203580 group, rats were treated by
intravenous injection sublingually with the p38 MAPK inhibitor
SB203580 (0.4 mg/kg) before the operation. In the sham and I/R
model groups, the femoral arteries were only exposed (Fig. 1).

2.1. Drug and animals
The p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (molecular weight = 377.43, purity N99.9%, veriﬁed by high-performance liquid chromatography) was
obtained from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). SB203580 was
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 20 mg/ml stock solution and stored at 4 °C for further use.
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (8–10 weeks old, 220–280 g, Grade II, license No. SCXK (Gui) 2009-0002) were obtained from the Experimental
Animal Center of Guilin Medical University. All experimental protocols
were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Guilin Medical
University.
2.2. Establishment of focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion model
Male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four experimental groups: sham operated group (sham group), ischemia/reperfusion group (I/R group), limb ischemic postconditioning group (LPostC
group) and LPostC + SB203580 group. Excepting the sham group, the
focal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model was induced in
rats by intraluminal nylon ﬁlament intrusion as previously described
with slight modiﬁcations [14]. In brief, under chloral hydrate anesthesia,
a 4-0 nylon monoﬁlament with a rounded tip was inserted into the right
common carotid artery, and advanced into the internal carotid artery
until it blocked the origin of the MCA. After ischemia for 2 h, reperfusion
was achieved by a careful ﬁlament withdrawal to restore blood ﬂow.
The cerebral ischemic/reperfusion injury model was developed with
2 h MCA occlusion followed by 24 h reperfusion. The sham group rats
were subjected to the same surgical procedures, except that the middle
cerebral arteries were not occluded following neck incision.
2.3. Limb ischemic postconditioning intervention
For the focal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model, rats in
the LPostC group and LPostC + SB203580 group were selected for isolation and exposure of the bilateral femoral arteries. After 2 h of occlusion,

2.4. Evaluation of neurological deﬁcit
At 24 h after modeling, the neurological functions of each animal
were evaluated according to methods described by Longa et al. [14].
Neurological deﬁcit was graded on a scale of 0 (normal) to 4 (maximal
deﬁcit) points. (1) 0 point: normal walk or no neurologic deﬁcit; (2) 1
point: failure to extend opposite forepaw fully or a mild focal neurologic
deﬁcit; (3) 2 points: circling to the contra-lateral side or a moderate
focal neurologic deﬁcit; (4) 3 points: falling to the contra-lateral side
or a severe focal neurologic deﬁcit; and (5) 4 points: no spontaneous
walking with depressed consciousness level. The neurological evaluation was performed by an investigator who was blinded to the study
protocol.
2.5. Tissue preparation and H&E staining
After 24 h reperfusion, 5 rats in each group were randomly selected
and anesthetized with chloral hydrate. Approximately 200 ml saline
was infused via an aortic root catheter until right auricle become
white, followed by 200 ml 4% ice-cold paraformaldehyde solution. The
brain tissue was harvested, ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for
24 h, and sliced into continuous 2-mm-thick coronal sections from the
front of the brain through the optic chiasm. After gradient ethanol dehydration, vitriﬁcation with xylene and embedding in parafﬁn wax, the
slices were cut into 5 μm-thick coronal sections on a vibratome. The sections were dried overnight in an incubator at 37 °C for later processing
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, and
immunohistochemistry.
H&E staining was applied to show the pathologic changes in the cerebral cortex. In brief, sections were deparafﬁnized with xylene, stained
with hematoxylin and eosin, and then observed by light microscopy.
The standard H&E staining protocols were analyzed by an independent
observer who was blinded to the identity of the study groups.

Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of the experimental protocol. The sham group rats were performed the similar procedure without right middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. Both the ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) group and limb ischemic postconditioning (LPostC) groups underwent MCA occlusion (MCAO) by occlusion of the right MCA for 2 h, followed by 24 h of reperfusion.
In the LPostC group and LPostC + SB203580 group underwent subsequent I/R of the bilateral femoral arteries, using 3 cycles of 10-min ischemia and 10-min reperfusion following MCA
reperfusion. In addition, rats in the LPostC + SB203580 group were treated by intravenous injection sublingually with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (0.4 mg/kg) before the operation.

2.6. TUNEL staining of apoptosis cells
The detection of apoptotic cells in the cerebral cortex from each
group was carried out using TUNEL method. The sections were
deparafﬁnized and rehydrated with xylene and graded alcohol series.
The sections were stained using the in situ cell apoptosis detection Kit
(Boster Biological Technology, Wuhan, China) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, the slides were treated with protease K for 20 min at room temperature, and then incubated with TUNEL
reaction buffer in a humidiﬁed chamber at 37 °C for 1 h. Next, slides
were washed in PBS and treated with converter-POD for 30 min at
room temperature. To visualize TUNEL positive cells, slides were stained
with diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate solution. When using this procedure, apoptotic nuclei were stained dark brown. The slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin for total nuclei counting. Finally, the
number of brown apoptotic cells was normalized to total cells as detected by hematoxylin. Five selected ﬁelds per rat were evaluated, and the
percentage of TUNEL positive cells was calculated.
2.7. Immunohistochemical staining of p-ATF2
Immunohistochemical detection of p-ATF2 (phospho-activating
transcription factor 2) was based on streptavidin–biotin complex formation. The sections were de-parafﬁnized using xylene, dehydrated
with graded alcohol, and treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for
10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Then the antigen was
rehabilitated by microwave treatment in citrate buffer, followed by
blocking steps carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol.
After non-speciﬁc binding sites were blocked by 10% BSA (bovine
serum albumin), the sections were incubated with phospho-ATF2
(T71) polyclonal primary antibody from rabbit (1:100 dilution,
ImmunoWay Biotechnology, Newark, DE, USA) at 4 °C overnight. Then
the secondary antibody, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody was applied for 90 min at room temperature. Next, the sections were washed
with PBS and incubated with streptavidin–biotin complex (SABC) for
30 min at 37 °C. The antibody was visualized using DAB. Finally, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and cover
slipped for analysis. Sections stained without primary antibody were
used as negative controls. The p-ATF2-positive area was identiﬁed by
a brown stain. In 5 randomly selected and non-repeated microscopic
ﬁelds (× 400) each section, the average number of p-ATF2-positive
cells per ﬁeld was calculated.
2.8. Western blot analysis

USA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t-test were
applied to determine differences. A probability (p) value b0.05 was
considered to indicate a statistically signiﬁcant difference.
3. Results
3.1. Limb ischemic postconditioning improved the neurological deﬁcits in
rats with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury
Neurological deﬁcits were evaluated on a 5 point scale after 24 h of
reperfusion following 2 h of MCA occlusion. Rats in sham-operated
group showed no neurological deﬁcit symptoms, while a signiﬁcant
increase in neurological score was found in rats with cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion injury, suggesting that the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
model was successfully constructed. The neurologic scores of the groups
treated with limb ischemic postconditioning (LPostC) or LPostC +
SB203580 were signiﬁcantly lower than that of the ischemia/reperfusion
group, indicating that limb ischemic postconditioning ameliorated the
brain function. However, there was no signiﬁcant difference between
LPostC group and LPostC + SB203580 group (Fig. 2).
3.2. Limb ischemic postconditioning alleviated ischemia/reperfusioninduced neuronal morphological changes
The pathologic changes in brain tissues were assessed by H&E
staining. As shown in Fig. 3, neuronal morphology in sham group
remained intact, and arranged in neat rows. And the cell contour was
distinguishable and nucleoli in the center of cells were observed clearly.
While the number of neurons in the ischemic penumbra area was
reduced in the I/R group. And these neurons were characterized by
decreased cell size, nuclear pyknosis, interstitial edema, cell disorder
and chromatin condensation. Compared with the I/R group, the LPostC
or LPostC+ SB203580 group showed a marked amelioration in the cellular morphology of the ischemic penumbra area, as only a few neurons
were showed to have nuclear pyknosis, hyperchromasia and extremely
loose organization. And the amelioration of cellular morphology was
more signiﬁcance in LPostC + SB203580 group than that in LPostC
group.
3.3. Limb ischemic postconditioning attenuated ischemia/reperfusioninduced apoptosis
The number of neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining,
which was identiﬁed by brown-stained nuclei. As depicted in Fig. 4,

After a reperfusion period of 24 h, the brain samples were immediately removed, and the ischemic penumbra areas of the cortex were
homogenized in chilled lysis buffer containing 1 mM PMSF. The protein
concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay kit. Equal
amounts of protein (40 μg/lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and then transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes
were blocked by 5% nonfat milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature.
Then the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for
overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. After three washes with TBST,
the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase at a dilution of 1:10,000 in
TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected with
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) western blot detection reagents
(Beyotime, China). The density of each band was quantiﬁed by using
image analysis software (Image J). The phospho-p38 protein levels
were normalized to β-actin.

All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 13.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,

penumbra area was reduced, and characterized by decreased cell size, nuclear pyknosis, interstitial edema, cell disorder and chromatin condensation. Compared with the I/R group, the

there were few apoptotic neurons in the sham group. However, numerous apoptotic neurons of the ischemic penumbra area were observed in
the I/R group. Compared with the I/R group, the LPostC or LPostC +
SB203580 group signiﬁcantly attenuated I/R-induced apoptosis. Meanwhile, the decrease of apoptotic neurons was more signiﬁcance in
LPostC + SB203580 group, which indicated that SB203580 potentiated
neuroprotection.

3.4. Limb ischemic postconditioning down-regulated the p-p38 protein
expression in the ischemic penumbra area
To investigate the neuroprotective mechanism of limb ischemic
postconditioning, we detected the level of p-p38 by western blotting.
The results showed that the p-p38 protein expression was signiﬁcantly
increased in I/R group in comparison with sham group. However, p-p38
levels distinctly reduced by limb ischemic postconditioning treatment
compared to I/R group. In addition, the effect of inhibiting p-p38 was
found to be more obvious in LPostC + SB203580 group than that in
LPostC group (Fig. 5).

3.5. Limb ischemic postconditioning decreased the p-ATF2 expression after
ischemia/reperfusion injury
To clarify whether p-ATF2 was involved in the neuroprotection
exerted by limb ischemic postconditioning, the expression of p-ATF2
in the four different groups was investigated by immunohistochemistry.
As illustrated in Fig. 6, p-ATF2 positive cells were stained with brown
and mainly mapped to the nucleus. Consistent with results from pp38 protein expression, the number of p-ATF2 positive cells was significantly increased in I/R group. After treatment of limb ischemic
postconditioning, p-ATF2 positive cells exhibited a marked reduction
than that in I/R group. Additionally, p-ATF2 positive cells in LPostC +
SB203580 group displayed a greater decrease than that in LPostC group.

activity of p-p38 was determined by western blotting. β-actin was used as loading control.
Results are expressed as the mean ± SD. Δp b 0.05, I/R vs sham group, ▲p b 0.05, vs I/R
group, *p b 0.05, and LpostC + SB203580 vs LpostC group, n = 5.

4. Discussion
In the present study, we analyzed the role of p38 MAPK signal
pathway in limb postconditioning against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The results showed that limb postconditioning exerted
a neuroprotective effects by inhibiting the I/R-induced apoptosis.
Consistent with this, the expressions of p-p38 and p-ATF2 in the ischemic penumbra area were upregulated by ischemic injury and attenuated by limb ischemia postconditioning.
Increasing evidence from existing research has indicated that ischemic tolerance produced by remote ischemic postconditioning
contributes to the protection of ischemic organs, with the underlying
mechanism involving a variety of signaling pathways or protein
kinases [15]. As one of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) family members, p38 MAPK can preferentially be activated
by environmental stresses, such as ultraviolet irradiation, X-rays,
heat shock, proinﬂammatory cytokine, and are involved in cell differentiation, apoptosis and autophagy [16]. Nowadays, potential
roles for p38 MAPKs in neuronal apoptosis have drawn a great deal
of attention. As it has been shown in some recent papers, increased
activity of p38 MAPK plays a pivotal role in the death of neurons
under stress stimuli [17,18], while inhibition of p38 MAPK reduces
cerebral ischemic injury and demonstrates neuroprotection in vivo
or in vitro [19,20]. In the present study, MCA occlusion caused a signiﬁcant increase in p38 MAPK activity and neuronal apoptosis,
whereas limb ischemia postconditioning or p38 MAPK inhibitor reduced the increase in p-p38 levels and reduced ischemia/reperfusion
injury. Since limb postconditioning suppressed the increase in p38
MAPK activity and reduced neuronal injury, and since selective
blockade of the p38 pathway reversed this neuronal injurious effect,
we conclude that limb postconditioning suppresses p38 MAPK signals in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rat.
The p38 MAPK pathways play important regulatory roles for a variety of downstream molecules and thus exert a wide variety of cellular functions. One of the downstream targets, ATF2, may give rise
to the complexity of MAPK effects on apoptosis. ATF2 is expressed
ubiquitously, with the highest level of expression in the brain [21,
22]. It is generally known that ATF2 can be activated through
serine/threonine phosphorylation by SAPK (stress-activated
MAPKs) such as p38 and Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) [23].
These phosphorylation events occur in response to various stresses,
including inﬂammatory cytokines, environmental stresses, and
DNA damage. Being activated, ATF2 transcriptionally regulates a
wide array of gene targets controlling other cellular pathways,
ranging from Atf, Jun and Fos transcription factors, to extracellular
cytokine and intracellular signaling pathways [24]. For example,
ATF2 and CREB1 can heterodimerize to directly regulate the Bcl2
promoter in chondrocytes [25]. It also has been reported that ATF2
mediates apoptosis in non-differentiated PC12 cells [26]. Our
ﬁndings showed that p-ATF2 protein expression in the ischemic
penumbra area was signiﬁcantly increased following cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion, and this increase was reduced by limb
postconditioning or p38 MAPK inhibitor, which suggests that the neuroprotective effects of limb postconditioning may correlate with the
suppression of p38 MAPK-ATF2 pathway in the ischemic penumbra
area following ischemia/reperfusion injury.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that limb postconditioning is likely to attenuate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury
in rat model through down-regulating p38 MAPK-ATF2 pathway, and
that these changes possibly contribute to the inhibition of neuronal
apoptosis.
