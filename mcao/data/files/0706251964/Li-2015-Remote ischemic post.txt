We make the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MACO) model and remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) model.
We examine changes in the level of AQP4 for each model.
RIPC suppresses the ischemia-induced reduction of AQP4 expression.
The neuroprotective mechanism of RIPC is mediated by the down-regulation of AQP4.
RIPC can serve as complementary and alternative treatments to protect brain from ischemic stroke.

Cerebral ischemia is a primary cause of human death and long-term disability. Previous studies have
suggested that remote ischemic post-conditioning (RIPC) is a potential useful tool for cerebral ischemic
treatment. However, the protective mechanism of RIPC is not very clear. This study veriﬁed the hypothesis
that, in remote post-conditioning of cerebral ischemic rats, down-regulation of aquaporin 4 (AQP4), which
is an important player for water hemostasis in astrocytes, could attenuate cerebral damage after transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In this study, RIPC model was established after MCAO. Each hind
limb of rat was clamped by small rubber tubes for 10 min, and then the tubes were opened for 10 min.
The clamping and opening were operated for a total of three cycles to block the hind limbs blood ﬂow.
The results showed that, RIPC could signiﬁcantly improve neurological function, decrease the percentage
of the infarct volume and edema, and elevate the integrity of blood–brain barrier (BBB). In addition, the
numbers of AQP4 and glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) positive cells were signiﬁcantly lower in the
RIPC group. Moreover, we found that AQP4 expression decreased in response to ischemia/reperfusion
in the RIPC group. Our ﬁndings indicated that RIPC could attenuate focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
injury, and the neuroprotective mechanism was related with the down-regulation of AQP4 in astrocytes.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is an emergency setting. It is the third leading
cause of death and the ﬁrst leading cause of long-term disability
in developed countries [1]. The pathological process of ischemic
stroke is inﬂuenced by many factors. Numerous researchers have
suggested that edema and blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption
could result in brain tissue injury after ischemic stroke [2,3].
Aquaporins (AQPs) play essential roles in the pathogenesis of
brain edema. As the members of the water channel protein family,
they are highly expressed in brain tissue, especially in astrocytic
end-feet. In the central nervous system, water channel protein
mainly expressed in astrocytic feet, BBB, subpial and subependymal regions. AQP4 is a water channel protein localized in the end
foot of astrocytes in the brain, and its expression is up-regulated
after a stab wound to the mouse brain [4]. It is an important player
for water hemostasis during the development of cytotoxic as well
as vasogenic edema. Increased expression of AQPs is important in
pathophysiology of neurological diseases such as neural inﬂammation and ischemia [5]. It has been known that, AQP4 could be linked
to permeabilization of the BBB in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
injury (CI/RI) [6]. Many literatures stated that AQP4 plays a pivotal role in ischemia-induced brain edema [7]. Moreover, AQP4
facilitates water movement into injured astrocytes across the BBB.
Previous studies showed reduced cytotoxic brain edema with
improved neurological outcome encountered in AQP4 knockout
mice after cerebral ischemia [8]. Cerebral edema resulting from
AQP4 over-expression is considered to be one of the major determinants for progressive neuronal insult during cerebral ischemia.
In a word, over expression of AQP4 is one of the chief contributors
of water imbalance in brain during ischemic pathology [9]. However, in ischemic brain, the role of AQP4 in intervention of RIPC is
unknown.
Ischemic post-conditioning, which refers to a series of brief
ischemia and reperfusion cycles, applied immediately at the site
of the ischemic organ. It can result in reduced infarction in both
cerebral and myocardial ischemia [10]. Post-conditioning can be
mimicked using anesthetics or other pharmacological agents as
stimuli to protect against ischemia/reperfusion injury or performed
in a distant organ [11]. RIPC, one of ischemic post-conditioning, is a
promising therapeutic intervention in which a sub-lethal ischemic
insult was induced in one organ (limb) to improve ischemia in an
organ distant to it (brain) [12]. Some studies showed that RIPC
could protect the ischemic brain via signaling pathways and factors
[13]. However, the change of AQP4 in RIPC is kept to be elusive. As
RIPC has protective effects on the brain, we proposed that AQP4
expression may be decreased in the distal reperfusion condition.

In this study, we tested the neuroprotective effect of limb RIPC
using the transient focal ischemic stroke model and investigated
the potential protective mechanisms related to AQP4.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and grouping
Adult female Sprague–Dawley rats (weighing 250–280 g, 7
weeks) were obtained from Chengdu DaShuo Biotechnological
Company (Chengdu, China). Rats were housed in plastic cages with
soft bedding and free access to food and water in an environmentally controlled room (at 22–26 ◦ C, 56–70% humidity, with a 12/12 h
light/dark cycle). Protocols of the animal approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Chengdu Medical College
were used. All animals were treated according to the principles
stated in relevant Chinese stipulations on animal experiments and
in conformity with the Guide for Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) criteria. The rats did not have hypertensive
and diabetic diseases.
All rats were allocated in 20 cages. Animals were randomly allocated to the following experimental groups: sham group, model
group and RIPC group. 1–2 rats from each cage were randomly
picked for sham processing, 41 rats totally. 74 and 70 rats were randomly selected from the remaining for MACO and RIPC processing,
respectively. The number of rats in each group represented the
actual usage suitable for the statistical analyses, and did not include
the rats which were eventually eliminated. Every group was further
divided into two sub-groups: 1 and 3 days. There was no signiﬁcant
difference between the sham sub-groups.
2.2. Rat model establishment
Transient MCAO was performed using the intraluminal ﬁlament
method as described previously [14] with slight modiﬁcations.
In all groups, rats were weighed and anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral hydrate mixed solution containing
0.9 mg/100 mL of sodium chloride and 10 mg/100 mL chloral
hydrate (350 mg/kg, IP) before surgery. Except the sham group, the
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model was established in rats from
the MCAO and RIPC group, via occlusion of the middle cerebral
artery. In brief, a midline incision was cut along the neck, followed
by separation of the right common carotid artery, internal carotid
artery and external carotid artery. A 0.26 mm nylon ﬁlament with
a blunt tip was inserted into the common carotid artery, and softly
advanced 18–20 mm from the branch point of the carotid artery
along the internal carotid artery until mild resistance was felt. One

S. Li et al. / Behavioural Brain Research 289 (2015) 1–8

hour later, the nylon thread was taken down and ischemia was
terminated to allow the reperfusion of blood ﬂow. If laser Doppler
monitoring (PF5001, Perimed AB, Sweden) conﬁrmed that the cerebral blood ﬂow decreased by more than 80%, MACO was successful.
In addition, after the animals awaken, rats with neurological behavior score more than 1 were also considered as successful. Rats
should be excluded if the nylon ﬁlament did not completely block
or stabbed the blood vessels. Sham-operated rats were subjected to
the same surgical procedure without any vessel ligation or occlusion. During surgery, rectal temperature was monitored in all the
animals and should be maintained at approximately 37 ± 0.5 ◦ C by
a heating pad and an overhead lamp. After surgery and blood ﬂow
restoration, the wound was sutured and the animals were allowed
to recover at ambient temperatures (21–23 ◦ C).
RIPC intervention: During reperfusion, rats were randomly
selected from cages for RIPC immediately after the MCAO. To produce limb ischemia, two ends of a cut rubber band were passed
through a small rubber tube to form a reversible snare. Ischemia
was induced by encircling this snare around each hind limb of the
rat. The bilateral femoral arteries was blocked for 10 min and then
opened for 10 min for a total of three cycles. During the blocking
process, pulse sensors placed on the bilateral dorsalis pedis arteries detected the pulses to determine whether the blood ﬂow in
the limbs was blocked. Limb ischemia was conﬁrmed by the disappearance of pulse, limbs expansion and cyanosis. In addition,
Reperfusion was conﬁrmed by the limbs return to their original
pink color. Following the RIPC, the rats’ normal activities including
walking, feeding and sleeping were closely observed. In the sham
and MCAO groups, there is no related processing.
2.3. Assessment of neurological deﬁcits
All tests were performed after 1 and 3 days of reperfusion. Neurological behavior of rats was assessed by three observers who were
blinded to the experimental conditions according to the methods of Longa et al. [15]. Finally, the scores were averaged. Score
0: normal condition with no neurological sign; Score 1: the left
anterior paw couldn’t completely stretch; Score 2: rats rotated
to the left side; Score 3: rats slumped to the left when walking;
Score 4: rats couldn’t walk independently and lose consciousness.
Animals which died from pulmonary insufﬁciency and suffocation
were excluded from the study [16]. The higher the score got, the
higher mortality had. In order to damage the brain as much as
possible, the 1–2 score animals were brought into the following
experimental procedure: sham group, MCAO group and RIPC group.
Due to the Garcia JH [17] particularly evaluated the motor function
and sensory function of rats with different score, which made the
score meaningful. The neurological scoring method of Garcia JH was
used to assess the nerve function damage degree of the rats from
six aspects (voluntary movement, body symmetry, arms stretched
function, climbing movement, body touch sensation on both sides,
bilateral beard reﬂection). The score of Garcia JH is between 3 and
18. The lighter the neurologic injury was, the larger the score would
get. Rats with score 18 was normal.
2.4. Tissue collection and making slices
Different material processing should be selected for requirements for different experimental methods. Following the deeply
anesthesia, the animal brains for histological staining were ﬁrstly
cleaned rapidly with 0.9% NaCl via heart perfusion which was
performed at days 1 and 3 and slowly pre-ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin. Then the skull was opened and the brain removed quickly.
There was no any processing after anesthesia, tissues obtained from
right middle cerebral artery territory of the hemisphere were used
for PCR analysis and placed in a freezer at −80 ◦ C. Furthermore,

3

if there was evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in extraction of
brain tissue, the animal should be excluded from the study. A 4 mm
coronal brain slices was achieved from the area 5 mm behind the
frontal pole and post-ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 h. Then
the slices were embedded in parafﬁn and further sliced into 5 ␮m
thickness sections. These slices were used for histological investigation. These methods of evaluation were performed by a blinded
pathologist.
2.5. Measurement of infarct volumes and brain edema
After assessment of neurological function, rats (sham group:
n = 5, MCAO group: n = 16, RIPC group: n = 16) were narcotized by
intraperitoneal injection with 10% chloral hydrate (100 g/0.3 mL)
and sacriﬁced by decapitation at days 1 and 3 after reperfusion. Brains were quickly removed and chilled at −20 ◦ C for
10 min. Then six consecutive 2-mm coronal sections were prepared, beginning from the anterior pole. The sections were
immediately immersed in 0.1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC; Sigma, USA) prepared in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) for 30 min at 37 ◦ C and then ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. The infarcted tissue remained unstained (white),
whereas normal tissue was stained as red. The sections were
photographed using a digital camera (Olympus, Japan). The infarct
zone was demarcated and analyzed by Image J software. In brief,
the ratio of infarct to normal volume was calculated according
to the following formula [18]: infarct volume % = [(contralateral
hemisphere volume − non-infarcted region in the ipsilateral hemisphere)/contralateral hemisphere volume] × 100%. At the same
time, for the evaluation of brain edema according to the results
of TTC, the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were used
to calculate the percentage of brain edema [19]: brain edema
% = [(volume of ipsilateral hemisphere − volume of contralateral
hemisphere volume)/contralateral hemisphere volume] × 100%.
2.6. Evaluation of blood–brain barrier permeability
The permeability of BBB was assessed by the leakage of Evans
blue (EB) following its intravenous injection. That is to say, 2%
Evans Blue tracer (4 mL/kg) (Sigma Aldrich, Germany) diluted in
0.9% NaCl was intravenously injected into tail vein at 1 h before
the animal was sacriﬁced, then the rats (sham group: n = 10, MCAO
group: n = 18, RIPC group: n = 14) were transcardially perfused with
saline to clear the remaining dye in the blood vessels. The brain
was quickly removed, weighed and cut up into ﬁne particles and
immersed in methanamide for 24 h at 60 ◦ C. The ﬁne particles were
centrifugated at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and then the absorption of
the supernatant was measured at 635 nm with a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The EB content was quantiﬁed as
micrograms of EB per gram of tissue using a standardized curve,
with methanamide as negative control.
2.7. Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence analysis
Brains (sham group: n = 10, MCAO group: n = 20, RIPC group:
n = 20) were removed and ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin at 4 ◦ C
for 24 h, and then they were dehydrated and embedded in parafﬁn blocks. The sections were dried, deparafﬁnized, hydrated and
underwent high-pressure antigen retrieval. The brain tissue sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide and 5% normal
goat serum at room temperature and 37 ◦ C for 10 min, respectively,
followed by incubation overnight at 4 ◦ C with rabbit polyclonal
anti-AQP4 antibody (diluted 1:150; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal
anti-glial ﬁbrillary acidic (GFAP) antibody (diluted 1:500; Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark). After washed in PBS, the sections were incubated with Polink-1-HRP-DAB Detection System to rabbit antibody

4

for 1 h and visualized using DAB. The control sections were incubated in PBS to replace the primary antibody. Finally, we randomly
selected ﬁve horizons around the infarct area and took the positive cell averages at 400× microscope by two pathology experts,
who were unaware of the groups. For double immunoﬂuorescence,
the brain tissue sections were prepared as described above, then
incubated overnight at 4 ◦ C in the mixture of mouse polyclonal antiNeuN antibody (diluted 1:300; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA)/rabbit
polyclonal anti-AQP4 antibody (diluted 1:80; Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-AQP4 antibody (diluted 1:80; Abcam)/mouse polyclonal
anti-GFAP antibody (1:200; Proteintech). After washed in PBS, the
sections were incubated with ﬂuorescence secondary antibody IgG
(anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated, green, 1:100, Invitrogen)
and IgG (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated, red, 1:100, Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 ◦ C. After DAPI mounting, the sections were
photographed and photographed with a ﬂuorescence microscope
(Olympus/BX53, Tokyo, Japan).

function, climbing movement, body touch sensation on both sides,
bilateral beard reﬂection. Compared with sham group, decreasing
Garcia JH score showed that the animals had decreasing neurological function (P < 0.01). However, after RIPC, the RIPC group score
was signiﬁcantly higher than that of MCAO group at each time point
(P < 0.05, Fig. 1A). So we concluded that neurological function was
improved after RIPC. In order to detect the underlying mechanism
of neurology improvement after RIPC, we measured brain edema
at reperfusion 1 and 3 days after MCAO injury using TTC staining.
White areas in brain are damaged due to ischemia (Fig. 1B). Based
on the result of TTC, we found that all RIPC animals have less percentage of cerebral infarction volume than that of MCAO group and
it showed a statistic signiﬁcance at days 1 and 3 (P < 0.05, Fig. 1C).
Furthermore, brain edema was signiﬁcantly reduced in RIPC group
at days 1 and 3 (P < 0.05, Fig. 1D) compared with the MCAO group.
That is to say, RIPC could alleviate brain edema and reduce the
infarct volume from cerebra ischemia.

2.8. RT-PCR analysis

3.2. RIPC preserved BBB integrity

Expression levels of AQP4 and GFAP mRNA were determined
by Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Rats (sham group: n = 16, MCAO group: n = 20, RIPC group: n = 20)
were used for RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from the lesion
boundary zone of brain using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Omega Bio-Tek,
Norcross, GA, USA). Extracted RNA was then reverse transcribed
to generate cDNA. The reverse transcription reaction was ampliﬁed using a Bio-Rad CFX96 Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA) with the PlexorTM One-Step qRT-PCR System (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). The cDNA was used as the template in
real-time PCR reactions to analyze the expression of AQP4 and
GFAP. The following primers were used in this study: AQP4
forward: CATTTGTTTGCAATCAATTAT; reverse: GACAGAAGACATACTCGTAAAGT; GFAP forward: AGATCGCCACCTACAGGAAT;

The PCR conditions were applied as follows: pre-denatured at 95 ◦ C
for 5 min, denatured at 95 ◦ C for 30 s, annealed at 51 ◦ C for 30 s, and
extended at 72 ◦ C for 1 min. All operations were repeated 45 times.
Upon completion of the last repetition, AQP4 and GFAP heating
were extended for 10 min at 72 ◦ C, and then stored at 4 ◦ C. AQP4
and GFAP were annealed at a temperature of 59 ◦ C. Then they were
photographed by a gel image analyzer (UVP, USA). The ﬂuorescence intensity (Ct) (A/B = Ex−Ct ) of ␤-actin served as the internal
standard for the samples. The values for Ex−Ct were calculated
according to the following formula: A/B = Ex−Ct . Ct means the ﬂuorescence intensity, A means the AQP4 mRNA expression quantity
of sample one and B means the AQP4 mRNA expression quantity of
sample two. The value of GFAP Ct was calculated as AQP4.

EB leakage was detected to evaluate the effect of RIPC on the
integrity of the BBB following cerebral ischemia reperfusion. The
results showed that, in MCAO and RIPC groups, the leakages of
EB were signiﬁcantly different from that of sham group at days
1 and 3 (Fig. 2B). Rats treated with RIPC exhibited a smaller and
less signiﬁcant amount of EB extravasations (Fig. 2A). These data
demonstrated that RIPC remarkably alleviated the impairment of
the BBB induced by brain ischemia.

In this study, we found that RIPC could decrease the expression
of GFAP. The number of GFAP positive cells in the ischemic cortex
was tested by immunohistochemistry analysis. The expression of
GFAP was marked with yellow staining in cytoplasm of astrocytes
in the brain. In the MCAO and RIPC groups, GFAP immunopositive proﬁles in cortex were stronger than that of the sham group
(P < 0.01, Fig. 3B). In addition, the number of GFAP positive cells in
RIPC group was signiﬁcantly lower than that in MCAO group at days
1 and 3 (P < 0.05, Fig. 3B), which indicated that RIPC might inhibit
the express of GFAP in the cortex. To further explore the change
of GFAP mRNA expression, the RT-PCR results showed the mRNA
expression of GFAP was signiﬁcantly increased in MCAO group
comparing to sham group, and RIPC decreased mRNA expression
relative in MCAO group at day 1 (P < 0.01, Fig. 3C). However there
was no statistical signiﬁcance at day 3 (P > 0.05). These demonstrated that the change of GFAP expression in the cerebral ischemic
was signiﬁcantly higher and RIPC was effective for inhibiting GFAP
expression.

2.9. Statistical analyses

3.4. AQP4 and GFAP co-location

Data were presented as the mean ± SD and subjected to statistics
analysis by SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Corp, USA). Multiple-group comparisons were used by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Student’s t-test was used to compare between two groups. Statistical signiﬁcance was accepted as P < 0.05.

Double immunoﬂuorescence staining was used to detect the
localization of AQP4 in brain. AQP4 and GFAP immune labeling in the ischemic brain showed a related co-localization. The
immunoreactivity of AQP4 could be seen in the vascular endothelial
cells, as well as GFAP+ astrocytes around the vessels. Co-localization
of AQP4 and GFAP exhibited in brain after ischemic injury (Fig. 4).

3.1. Detrimental outcomes after cerebral ischemia
Garcia JH score was used to assess the functional recovery after
cerebral ischemic. Rats from sham animals were under normal condition as control and had Garcia JH score of 18. Rats were assessed in
six aspects: voluntary movement, body symmetry, arms stretched

Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine the
expression of AQP4 in ischemia brain. AQP4 was found in cortex
of each group at days 1 and 3, respectively (Fig. 5A). According to
the statistical analysis, the number of AQP4 positive cells in the
brain increased signiﬁcantly in the MCAO group and RIPC group,

Fig. 1. Amelioration of brain injury by RIPC. (A) The score of three groups were evaluated by Garcia JH (**P < 0.01 for MCAO and RIPC versus sham). Compared with MCAO
group, Garcia JH score was increased signiﬁcantly at days 1 and 3 after RIPC (# P < 0.05). (B) TTC staining showed that white areas were damaged by ischemic injury. White
was representative of ischemia area. (C) The volume of tissue infarction was recorded 30 ± 0.68% in MCAO group. At day 3, in the group of RIPC, the percentage of brain tissue
infarction decreased to 22 ± 0.23% (# P < 0.05). What’s more, it is the lowest volume of infarction at day 1, in the RIPC group (15 ± 0.26%, # P < 0.05). (D) Brain edema (%) was
reduced in RIPC group compared with the MCAO group at days 1 and 3 (# P < 0.05).

compared with the sham group at days 1 and 3 (Fig. 5C). However, compared with the MCAO group, the positive cells of AQP4
decreased signiﬁcantly in the RIPC group at days 1 and 3 (P < 0.05,
Fig. 5C). In addition, it showed that AQP4 was stained in astrocytes, rather than neurons (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the RT-PCR results

showed that the expression levels of AQP4 mRNA was signiﬁcantly
increased both in MCAO group and RIPC group relative to sham
group at day 1 (P < 0.05, Fig. 5D). In RIPC group, the level of AQP4
mRNA signiﬁcantly decreased at day 1, compared with MCAO group
(P < 0.01). However, there was no statistical signiﬁcance at day
3 (P > 0.05). This conﬁrmed that the RIPC could inhibit the overexpression of AQP4 and contribute to the functional improvement
after cerebral ischemic injury.

examined with Evans Blue content in cerebral tissue. (B) The analysis of cerebral
concentration of EB (**P < 0.01, *P < 0.05, for MCAO and RIPC versus sham, ## P < 0.01,
#
P < 0.05 for RIPC versus MCAO).

The present study showed that RIPC performed by three cycles
of 10-min ischemia and 10-min reperfusion in the hind limbs, could
decrease the cerebral infarct, edema and BBB disruption, moreover, improve the neurofunctional recovery from ischemic stroke
via down-regulating the expression of AQP4 in astrocytes in rats.
It has been widely proved that RIPC could protect the brain
from ischemic stroke [12,13]. However, the mechanism of RIPC
protection remained unclear. Recently, some papers showed that
the neuroprotective mechanism of RIPC was mediated by an antiapoptotic effect and reduction of the inﬂammatory response and
alleviated cerebral ischemic injury by attenuating endoplasmic
reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis [20]. In addition, non-invasive
remote limb ischemic post-conditioning protected rats against
focal cerebral ischemia by the up-regulation of STAT3 and

reducing apoptosis [21]. What is more, there was reported that
remote limb ischemic conditioning during acute stroke conferred neuroprotection, possibly due to increased cerebral blood
ﬂow (CBF) [22]. In addition, limb RIPC reduced brain reperfusion injury by reversing eNOS uncoupling [23]. Many papers
suggested that RIPC could protect organs from ischemia to attenuate post-resuscitation myocardial and infarct size in patients
with myocardial infarction, decrease acute kidney, lung and liver
injury, gastric mucosal lesions in rats, and cerebral dysfunction and
improved the duration of survival [24–26].
To estimate the degree of brain damage accounting for the
neurological deﬁcits indirectly, the scores of Longa were used in
this study. What is more, Garcia JH scoring method could elaborately show the emerging neural functional symptom details of
rat after stroke, so it was applied for neurological deﬁcits assessment. The results showed that the scores of Garcia JH in the RIPC
group were signiﬁcantly lower than those of the MCAO group. Thus,
we suggested that RIPC could improve the neurological functional
recovery from ischemic stroke.
AQP4 might be involved in change of astrocyte and astrocyterelated behaviors during aging [27]. A secondary and often lethal
consequence of traumatic brain injury was cellular edema, so
astrocytic swelling was caused by transmembrane water ﬂuxes
augmented by vasopressin-regulated AQP4 [28]. During the last
few years, a number of studies had shown that astrocytes swelled
in the presence of cerebral ischemia. As is known to all, during
the early hours of cerebral ischemia, edema was formed by a process involving osmotically obliged water across BBB from the blood

into the brain. At the same time, perivascular astrocytes rapidly
swelled as they took up water to enter the brain, forming cytotoxic
edema. A number of studies had provided evidence that BBB disruption, AQP4 protein abundance and mRNA abundance in swelling
astrocyte were induced by MCAO [29]. A recent study also conﬁrmed that astrocytes played a pivotal role in vitro stroke model
of the blood–brain barrier [30]. Imparting brain damage by MCAO
was previously reported to increase AQP4 expression in the infarct
zone shortly after the insult [31]. On the other hand, another study
suggested that AQP4 inhibition might provide a new therapeutic option for reducing brain edema [32]. AQP4 was associated
with brain damage after MCAO. Numerous studies demonstrated
that cerebral edema may be attenuated via the regulation of AQP4
expression, thus initiating a novel therapeutic strategy against this
possibly fatal condition [33].
Using TTC staining, our ﬁndings indicated that RIPC could signiﬁcantly reduce the cerebral infarct volume and edema induced
by cerebral ischemia, and attenuate the expression of AQP4 in
the ischemic brain, which suggested that the protective mechanism of RIPC was partially dependent on the down-regulation
of AQP4 expression contributing to the improvement of functional outcomes. Our data showed increasing expression of AQP4 in
MCAO group, while RIPC signiﬁcantly down-regulated AQP4 mRNA
levels after MCAO especially at day 1, which suggested that downregulated of AQP4 could improve brain damage at early time of
cerebral ischemia.
In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that
RIPC was an effective treatment for brain tissue injury and

8

neurological deﬁcits following MCAO in rats. Therefore, this study
provided the evidence to support the view that RIPC could serve as
complementary and alternative treatments to protect brain from
ischemic stroke. In addition, down-regulation of AQP4 in the RIPC
might be a potential mechanism and might provide therapeutic
target to repair brain injury and improve functional outcomes following acute ischemic stroke. To sum up, the present study showed
that RIPC could alleviate brain edema and BBB permeability, resulting in cerebral ischemia tolerance. The RIPC preserved the cerebral
ischemia and suppressed the ischemia-induced reduction of AQP4
expression.
