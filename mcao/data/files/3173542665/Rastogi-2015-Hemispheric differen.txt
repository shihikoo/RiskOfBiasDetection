Background: We recently reported that left versus right hemisphere cerebral infarctions patients more frequently
have worse outcomes. However our clinical experience led us to suspect that the incidence of malignant middle
cerebral artery infarctions (MMCA) was higher in the right compared to the left hemispheric strokes.
Objective: To determine whether laterality in MMCA stroke is an important determinant of stroke sequelae.
Methods: A systematic search was performed for publications in PubMed using “malignant middle cerebral artery
and infarction”. A total of 73 relevant studies were abstracted.
Results: MMCA laterality data were available for 2673 patients, with 1687 (63%) right hemispheric involvement,
thus right being more commonly associated with MMCA (binomial test, p b 0.05). While mortality rates were
similar, right hemispheric MMCA (n = 271) had mortality of 31% (n = 85) whereas left hemispheric MMCA
(n = 144) had mortality of 36% (n = 53), morbidity rates were worse on the right.
Conclusion: MMCA stroke appears to be more common on the right, and this laterality is also associated with
signiﬁcantly higher morbidity. Further prospective studies are needed to more completely understand the nature
of this laterality as well as test possible new treatments to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with MMCA.

1. Introduction
Middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarction can cause brain
edema leading to mass effect and herniation [1]. These malignant middle cerebral artery infarctions (MMCA) account for an estimated 10% of
all hemispheric strokes [2]. The malignant sequelae are most commonly
seen during the ﬁrst week of stroke onset, and MMCA is associated with
a mortality rate approaching 80% [3].
Several clinical, molecular and radiological predictors for malignant
transformation of a stroke have been identiﬁed. Clinical predictors
include a higher score on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale
(NIHSS) [4], nausea and vomiting within 24 hours and the need for
mechanical ventilation [5]. Radiological ﬁndings predicting MMCA include the computed tomography (CT) ﬁnding of hypodensity involving
more than 50% of middle cerebral artery territory, a perfusion deﬁcit of
more than 66% on CT [5], larger infarct volume (N 145 ml) within 2–14
hours of symptom onset on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging and involvement of internal carotid artery along with other intracranial vasculature e.g. anterior or posterior cerebral artery [4]. Biological
markers that predict MMCA development include plasma matrix
metalloprotienase-9 ≥ 140 ng/mL and cellular ﬁbronectin N 16.6 μg/mL [6].
Current management directed towards MMCA involves administration of hyperosmolar agents and decompressive hemicraniectomy
(DHC). While medical management (MM) often is ineffective, it may
be prescribed as an interim measure while deciding about DHC. Recent
evidence suggests that DHC does reduce early mortality following a
MMCA stroke [7]. Large multicenter trials 8,9 demonstrate that DHC is
superior to MM in reducing acute mortality [4].
Although frequently overlooked, the laterality of the affected hemisphere also is an important determinant of stroke sequelae. We recently
reported an analysis of ischemic stroke laterality in which we found
that with left hemisphere cerebral infarctions patients more frequently
have worse outcomes [8] and other studies have also reported similar
ﬁndings [9,10]. In addition, the scores on the NIHSS also are weighted
towards left hemisphere lesions [11], however our pilot study led us to
suspect that the incidence of MMCA was higher in right than left hemispheric strokes. Thus, after analysis of our patient data we compared
the results with that of the literature data to learn if there are hemispheric
differences in the incidence and outcomes of MMCA. We also investigated
overall and therapy based outcomes associated with MMCA.

2.2. Literature search
A systematic search was performed for publications in PubMed from
1966–2014 using terms such as “malignant middle cerebral artery
stroke,” as well as “malignant middle cerebral artery and infarction”.
Inclusion criteria for the selection of articles included: patients with
MMCA, description of laterality of the MMCA, age N 18 years and articles
in English. Pediatric patients, articles which were not available as full

2.1. University of Florida Stroke database
The University of Florida Institutional Review Board approval (IRB
number: 201300170) was obtained for this study where we performed
a retrospective review of patient data obtained from the University of
Florida stroke database. The patient selected were all patients with
MMCA who underwent DHC from 2007–2013. The ﬁnal cohort

text and individual and multiple case reports were excluded from the
study. The following features, when available, were included, in the
ﬁnal analysis: age, sex, total number of patients, NIHSS score on admission, laterality, treatment modalities, outcome metrics and mortality.

A total of 34 patients with MMCA were evaluated and treated with
DHC during the investigated period (Table 1). The overall mean age of
these patients was 54.5 years and there were 23 men and 11 women.
Male dominance and mortality was proportional across both left and
right MMCA, however the sample size was small. There appeared to
be a hemispheric asymmetry, with 24 (71%) MMCA patients suffering
right sided infarctions (binomial test, Left vs. Right MMCA, p = 0.026).
3.2. Literature data analysis
A total of 298 articles were obtained. Finally, 73 relevant studies
were identiﬁed and the relevant data were extracted [2,3,11–81]
(Fig. 1).
3.2.1. Demographics
Data from 2718 patients were considered in our literature review.
The overall mean age for patients included in our analysis was 57.5
after excluding purely pediatric studies (age ≤ 18 years). Sex data
were reported for 2649 patients, with 1530 (57.8%) men and 1119
(42.2%) women, showing male dominance (binomial test, Male vs. Female, p b 0.05), however without controlling for other risk factors
(Table 2).

2.3. Statistical analysis

3.2.2. Hemispheric differences in the literature
MMCA laterality data were available for 2673 patients, with 1687
(63%) right and 986 (37%) left hemispheric involvement, thus the
right being more commonly associated with MMCA (binomial test,
p b 0.05) (Table 2). Further analysis showed similar sex ratios between
the hemispheres.

As MMCA has two broadly deﬁned treatment modalities, decompressive hemicraniectomy (DHC) and MM, we divided treatment into
these two categories. The hemispheric differences in relation to sex, outcomes (morbidity and mortality), were also analyzed and included the
Modiﬁed Rankin Scale (mRS) score and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS)
score at follow up. Outcomes of MMCA were broadly divided into 2
groups, favorable and unfavorable, as described by other studies [11,22,
50,51,56]. Since MMCA strokes have very high NIHSS we deﬁned
favorable outcomes (absence of symptoms to moderate disability) as
mRS score ≤ 3 or GOS score N3 whereas unfavorable outcomes (severe
disability to death) were deﬁned by mRS score ≥ 4 or GOS score ≤ 3. Outcome analyses included overall outcome, outcome differences between
hemispheres and between treatment modalities. Mortality analysis also
included overall mortality, mortality differences between hemispheres
and between treatment modalities. However, it must be noted that variations exist in time points for estimation of mortality and outcomes
across the studies. These variations usually ranged from hospital

3.2.3. Mortality analysis
Review of 60 studies which evaluated the mortality after MMCA,
yielded 2356 patients, with an overall mortality rate of 30% (n = 717).
Only 16 studies (n = 786) had detailed mortality information in relation to the modality of therapy used of which randomization was
undertaken in 6 studies (n = 307) (Table 3). Among these 786 patients,
DHC was performed in 428 patients with a mortality of 29% (n = 124)
and a MM was undertaken in 399 patients with mortality of 71%
(n = 282). Aggregating across these studies we found that DHC is a
more effective treatment approach than MM for MMCA with regards
to mortality (Fisher’s exact test, two tailed p = 0.0001; RR of 0.41
with 95%CI of 0.35–0.48, NNT = 2.4). Differential mortality data for
both hemispheres were available for only 19 studies (n = 415). Right
hemispheric MMCA (n = 271) was associated with a mortality of 31%
(n = 85) whereas left side (n = 144) had a mortality of 36% (n = 53)
(Fisher’s exact test, two tailed p = 0.2751; RR of 0.85 with 95%CI of
0.73–0.98, NNT = −18.38). (See Table 4.)

Fig. 2. Analysis of mortality and outcome in the literature: (A) Mortality assessment in relation to treatment modality and hemispheric involvement respectively; (B) Outcome assessment
in relation to treatment modality and hemispheric involvement respectively. DHC signiﬁcantly decreased the mortality (p = 0.0001) and improved the outcomes (p = 0.0046) in MMCA
patients. (DHC – Decompressive Hemicraniectomy, MM – Medical management, R – Right, L – Left.)

3.2.4. Outcomes analysis
Outcome data beyond simple mortality were available for 49 studies
(n = 1591), out of whom 72% (n = 1141) patients had unfavorable outcomes. Only 11 studies (n = 572) discussed the outcomes in relation to
the modality of treatment of which randomization was only undertaken
in 4 studies (n = 229). In this group of 572 patients, 237 underwent
DHC and 335 underwent MM. Unfavorable outcomes were observed in
71% (n = 169) of the DHC treated patients and 81% (n = 273) of the
MM patients with the latter more likely to have an unfavorable outcome
(Fisher’s exact test, two tailed p = 0.0046; RR of 0.88 with 95%CI of
0.65–1.18, NNT = 9.819). Differential outcome in relation to hemispheric involvement was available in 14 studies (n = 251). Out of these 251
patients, 177 patients had right and 74 had left hemispheric involvement. About, 72% (n = 127) patients with right side involvement had
unfavorable outcomes whereas in left side strokes 62% (n = 46) patients
had unfavorable outcomes (Fisher’s exact test, two tailed p = 0.138; RR
of 1.15 with 95%CI of 0.79–1.68, NNT of 10.43) (Fig. 2).
3.3. Comparison between University of Florida series and the literature
review
On comparing our cohort with the literature we found striking
similarities. The incidence of MMCA was higher in men as compared
to the women, and right hemispheric MMCAs were also more common.
Mortality analysis of both groups revealed the absence of hemispheric
asymmetries, however the limited sample size restricts interpretation.
4. Discussion
In this study (Fig. 3), we found that right hemisphere MMCA was
more prevalent than left hemisphere MMCA. Overall, MMCA patients
were predominantly male, although this was not controlled for other
risk factors. Nearly three quarters of the overall stroke incidence have
been reported in ages more than 65 years [84], however, the mean
age of MMCA patients treated at our institution was 55, similar to the
mean age calculated from our literature review (57.5), reﬂecting the
likely preponderance of MMCA in younger stroke populations. The
overall mortality rate arising from MMCA was approximately 30%,
much less compared to a previous study [2] owing to the fact that we
looked at a larger data set which included patients treated with DHC,
which has been found to reduce mortality. Although, DHC in comparison to MM signiﬁcantly improved the overall outcome, large proportions (71%) of the patients were still severely disabled. Thus, alternate
treatment regimens improving both quality of life and mortality in
MMCA patients are warranted. For patients with MMCA, there was no

signiﬁcant mortality difference between hemispheres. Also, there was
no signiﬁcance observed on comparing the outcomes across the two
hemispheres.
Prior studies have revealed that left hemispheric ischemic strokes
mainly involving the middle cerebral artery territory are much more
frequent and devastating [8,9]. In this current study, we found that
infarctions of the right hemisphere show higher propensity for
malignant transformation after acute ischemia than do similar
vascular events to the left hemisphere. The reason for this asymmetry is not known, however this ﬁnding suggests an underlying hemispheric asymmetry that may be neuro-anatomic, physiological or
neurochemical (Fig. 3).
Several studies have revealed that the lateralization of stroke has different effects on the cardiovascular system leading to changes in blood
pressure, heart rate and other cardiovascular parameters [85–87].
These studies suggest that right hemisphere plays a crucial role in the
cardiovascular regulation due to autonomic nervous system lateralization [83]. For example, Meyer et al. [87]. studied patients the ﬁrst
5 days after right and left hemisphere strokes to learn if there were
changes in the autonomic nervous systems, including blood pressure,
cardiac output, heart rate as well as differences in norepinephrine and
epinephrine levels. These investigators found that sympathetic functioning was most affected by right hemisphere stroke, including an increase norepinephrine levels as well as elevations of blood pressure
[87].
The insula appears to be one of the major regions of the cerebral
hemisphere that play a critical role in regulation of the autonomic
nervous system [86,88,89]. and greater alterations of sympathetic activation are seen after right than left hemispheric insular infarction [90].
Right insular infarction are also associated with an increase in the mortality at 3 months as compared to the left insular or non-insular lesions,
independent of the stroke severity, lesion volume and age [90].
The increase in norepinephrine levels and sympathetic activation
associated with right insula damage [85] can have several adverse
effects that may important in MMCA. First, norepinephrine induced
vasoconstriction may be responsible for an increase in ischemic damage
[91,92]. Second, increased levels of norepinephrine can lead to increase
the permeability of water and is thought to be related to alterations of
brain capillary permeability [93]. Third, norepinephrine has also been
shown to increase the levels of extracellular glutamate by stimulation
of β-adrenoreceptors [94] and increased levels of glutamate can also
lead to alterations in intracellular Ca2 + [95] as well as increase the
Na+ plasma membrane permeability [96] creating an intracellular
Ca2+ and Na+ osmotic gradient and thus attracting extracellular ﬂuid
into the cell resulting in the development of cytotoxic edema [97].

brain barrier, MCA – Middle cerebral artery).

Finally, increased norepinephrine can stimulate the α-1 adrenergic receptors in the supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus and thereby enhance
the release of vasopressin [98]. Vasopressin can then lead to aquaporin-4
down regulation which induces an increase in the plasma membrane permeability and thereby can lead to increased cerebral edema [99]. Vasopressin also participates in the cascade of ischemic reactions leading to
neuroinﬂammation, edema, apoptosis and necrosis [100,101] that may
be another factor in the asymmetrical development of MMCA.
Along with the insula the parietal lobe might also be damaged
with a cerebral infarction given its common blood supply from a
single artery that arises from the inferior segment of MCA [102]. Involvement of Brodmann area 7 of the superior parietal cortex causes
substantial autonomic dysfunction by activation of the sympathetic
center in the postero-lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus [103].
Controversy exists in regards to the laterality of parietal lobe
involvement leading to autonomic dysfunction, with some studies
suggest that this autonomic dysfunction is more commonly localized
to right parietal cortex [103,104]. However, another study suggests
that left parietal lobe ischemic strokes favor higher autonomic dysregulation [105]. Therefore further studies are needed to examine
the inﬂuence of the left versus right parietal lobe damage on autonomic dysregulation.

Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature which restricts individual patient data availability as well as inclusion of many
non-randomized cohorts. Variations in the time points for estimation
of outcome and mortality between studies and inclusion of studies
where there might be selection bias by clinicians depending on dominant and non-dominant hemispheric stroke involvement to choose
their intervention are also important limitations. Lastly, prospective
clinical studies investigating role of neurotransmitters and insular effect
on hemispheric differences are limited necessitating our hypothesis
generated about hemispheric differences and outcome on animal and
historical studies.

5. Conclusion
In this study we found that MMCA is more common with right than
left hemispheric strokes. This might be due to asymmetrical insula and
parietal control of the autonomic nervous system and alteration of norepinephrine levels. Further prospective studies are needed to more
completely understand the nature of this laterality and localization as
well as test possible new treatments which can reduce the mortality
and morbidity associated with MMCA.
