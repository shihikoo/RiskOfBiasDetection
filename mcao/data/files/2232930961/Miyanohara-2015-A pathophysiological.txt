Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a non-selective cation channel with high Ca2þ
permeability, which functions as a polymodal nociceptor activated by heat, protons and several vanilloids, including capsaicin and anandamide. Although TRPV1 channels are widely distributed in the
mammalian brain, their pathophysiological roles in the brain remain to be elucidated. In this study, we
investigated whether TRPV1 is involved in cerebral ischemic injury using a middle cerebral artery (MCA)
occlusion model in wild-type (WT) and TRPV1-knockout (KO) mice. For transient ischemia, the left MCA
of C57BL/6 mice was occluded for 60 min and reperfused at 1 and 2 days after ischemia. We found that
neurological and motor deﬁcits, and infarct volumes in TRPV1-KO mice were lower than those of WT
mice. Consistent with these results, intracerebroventricular injection of a TRPV1 antagonist, capsazepine
(20 nmol), 30 min before the onset of ischemia attenuated neurological and motor deﬁcits and improved
infarct size without inﬂuencing cerebral blood ﬂow in the occluded MCA territory. The protective effect
of capsazepine on ischemic brain damage was not observed in TRPV1-KO mice. WT and TRPV1-KO mice
did not show any differences with respect to the increased number of Iba1-positive microglia/macrophages, GFAP-positive astrocytes, and Gr1-positive neutrophils at 1 and 2 days after cerebral ischemia.
Taken together, we conclude that brain TRPV1 channels are activated by ischemic stroke and cause
neurological and motor deﬁcits and infarction after brain ischemia.

1. Introduction
Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide [1]
and the leading cause of adult disability [2]. The burden of stroke is
predicted to increase greatly with the anticipated increase in the
aging population, which will increase further the demand for new
therapies [2]. In fact, current therapeutic approaches, using antiplatelet and thrombolytic agents, only partially ameliorate the
clinical outcome of stroke patients since these drugs are not aimed
at counteracting the mechanisms associated with neuronal cell
death, but at preserving or restoring cerebral blood ﬂow [3].
Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), one of the best
characterized members of the TRP channel family, is a capsaicin
receptor (also known as vanilloid receptor VR1) and is activated not

only by capsaicin but also by heat (>43  C), acid (pH < 6.0), and
various lipids, i.e., unsaturated N-acyl-dopamines, lipoxygenase
products from arachidonic acid, an endocannabinoid anandamide,
2-arachidonoyl-glycerol, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
[4]. Although TRPV1 is involved in peripheral nociception, TRPV1 is
widely expressed in the rodent brain, including the hippocampus,
cortex, cerebellum, olfactory bulb, mesencephalon, and hindbrain
[5,6], suggesting that TRPV1 has a physiological role in the CNS. In
this context, stimulation of TRPV1 in the ventral midbrain selectively accelerates glutamatergic inputs to midbrain dopaminergic
neurons [7]. Moreover, recent research shows that TRPV1 is
involved in synaptic plasticity in hippocampal interneurons [8],
dentate gyrus [9], and nucleus accumbens [10]. Despite evidence
suggesting that TRPV1 has a physiological role in the CNS, little is
known about its pathophysiological role in neurological disorders,
especially in cerebral ischemic injury.
Therefore, to investigate the possible involvement of TRPV1 in
neuronal damage after cerebral ischemia in vivo, we evaluated the

from the forelimbs; and 5, fall. The ﬁnal score was the average of
ﬁve trials.
2.6. Measurement of infarct volume

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
Male TRPV1-KO and WT mice at 8 weeks of age weighing
20e30 g were used in this study. TRPV1-KO mice were originally
provided by Dr Julius and were maintained in our laboratory at a
constant ambient temperature of 22 ± 1  C under a 12-h light/dark
cycle, and were fed water and chow ad libitum. The experiments
were conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of Kyoto
University Animal Experimentation Committee and the Guidelines
of the Japanese Pharmacological Society.
2.2. Transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion
Mice were anesthetized with 1% halothane in 30% O2 and 70%
N2O using a face mask. After a midline skin incision, the left common carotid artery and external artery were isolated and ligated. An
8e0 nylon monoﬁlament coated with silicon (180e200 mm in
diameter) was introduced into the left internal carotid artery
through the common carotid artery to occlude the origin of the
MCA. After 60 min of occlusion, the monoﬁlament was withdrawn
to allow reperfusion and the mouse was placed in a thermally
controlled incubator (32.0  C) for 2 h before being returned to its
cage. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5  C with a
thermostat-controlled heating pad throughout the operation.
Regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) in the MCA territory was
monitored by Laser Doppler Flowmetry (Omegaﬂow; Omegawave
Inc., Tokyo, Japan). A ﬂexible probe was ﬁxed to the skull (2 mm
posterior and 6 mm lateral to bregma) before MCA occlusion. Only
mice showing <20% of baseline rCBF in the MCA territory after
occlusion and >60% of baseline after reperfusion were used in
subsequent experiments.

After neurological deﬁcit score evaluation, mice were sacriﬁced,
the brains were removed, and the forebrains were sliced into eight
coronal 1-mm sections using a mouse brain matrix. The slices were
placed in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 37  C for
20 min. The infarct area of each brain slice was quantiﬁed using
image analysis software (Image J). The infarct volumes were
calculated by multiplying each area by the slice thickness.
2.7. Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
Mice were intraperitoneally injected with 50 mg/kg pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with 0.1 M PBS followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS. Brains were stored in ﬁxative for
3 h and then transferred into 0.1 M PBS containing 15% sucrose for
24 h. Coronal sections with a 20 mm thickness were obtained using
a cryomicrotome (Leica, Bensheim, Germany). Brain sections were
soaked in 0.1% Triton X100 for permeabilization and then incubated
overnight at 4  C with the following primary antibodies: a rabbit
polyclonal anti-Iba1 antibody (1:500 dilution, Wako); a rabbit
polyclonal anti-GFAP antibody (1:1000 dilution, DAKO); and a rat
monoclonal anti-Gr1 (Ly6G) antibody (1:300 dilution, R&D Systems). For immunoﬂuorescence, sections were incubated with
secondary antibodies (Alexa Flour 594-labeled donkey anti-rabbit
IgG (1:300 dilution, Molecular Probes) and Alexa Flour 488labeled donkey anti-rat IgG (1:300 dilution, Molecular Probes))
for 1.5 h in the dark at room temperature. Immunoﬂuorescence was
visualized with an Olympus Fluo View microscope equipped with a
laser scanning confocal imaging system. The number of Iba1-and
GFAP-immunoreactive cells in the peri-ischemic area was counted in ﬁve 500  500 mm2 ﬁelds at approximately þ0.7 mm
from bregma. The number of Gr1-positive cells in the ischemic
core area was counted in ﬁve 500  500 mm2 ﬁelds at
approximately þ0.7 mm from bregma.

2.3. Intracerebroventricular injection
2.8. Data analysis
The TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine was injected 1 mm posterior
and 1 mm lateral to the bregma on the left side. A 23-G needle
attached to a Hamilton microsyringe was inserted so that its tip was
located 3 mm beneath the dural surface. The needle was kept in the
same position for 1 min before removal. Capsazepine was dissolved
in 20% DMSO/80% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and administered at a dose of 20 nmol/5 ml per mouse.

Data are presented as the mean ± SEM and were analyzed using
GraphPad Prism version 5.0. Neurological deﬁcit scores, results of
the rope grip test, and infarct volumes were analyzed using Student's t-test. The numbers of Iba1þ or GFAPþ cells were analyzed by
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the post hoc
Bonferroni test. In all cases, differences of p < 0.05 were considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

2.4. Neurological deﬁcit score
3. Results
Neurological deﬁciency was evaluated using a 5-point neurological deﬁcit score test. After several days of ischemia, mice were
tested for behavioral changes and scored as follows: 0, no deﬁcit; 1,
ﬂexion of contralateral forelimb and torso upon lifting the animal
by the tail; 2, circling to the ipsilateral side but normal posture at
rest; 3, circling to the ipsilateral side; 4, rolling to the ipsilateral
side; and 5, no spontaneous motor activity.
2.5. Rope grip test
Motor dysfunction was evaluated by using the 5-point rope grip
test. After several days of ischemia, mice were tested for behavioral
changes and scored as follows: 0, escape; 1, grasping the tightrope
with the four legs and the tail; 2, hanging from the forelimbs and
the hindlimbs; 3, hanging from the forelimbs; 4, trying to hang

3.1. TRPV1 gene deﬁciency improves neurological outcome and
reduces infarct volume
To investigate the involvement of TRPV1 in ischemicreperfusion injury, we examined the effects of TRPV1 deﬁciency
on ischemic brain injury using a mouse focal ischemia model. The
left MCA was occluded for 60 min followed by reperfusion. MCA
occlusion in WT and TRPV1-KO mice decreased rCBF to <20% of
baseline and reperfusion restored rCBF. No differences in rCBF were
observed between the two mouse genotypes (Fig. 1A). Neurological
deﬁciency levels were similar between WT and TRPV1-KO mice at 1
day after ischemia; however, at 2 days after reperfusion, TRPV1-KO
mice showed less neurological deﬁciency than WT mice (Fig. 1B).
Motor dysfunction was less severe in TRPV1-KO mice than in WT

effects of the TRPV1 antagonist capsazepine on ischemic brain
injury. Thirty minutes after intracerebroventricular injection of
vehicle or capsazepine (20 nmol), no differences in rCBF were
observed between either group of mice (Fig. 2A). At 2 days after
reperfusion, the degree of neurological deﬁciency and motor
dysfunction in capsazepine-treated mice was signiﬁcantly lower
than that in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2B and C). In addition, the
infarct volume was signiﬁcantly smaller in capsazepine-treated
mice than in vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2D and E).

mice at 1 and 2 days after reperfusion (Fig. 1C). Infarct volume was
evaluated by TTC staining after performing the behavioral test. The
volume in TRPV1-KO mice was signiﬁcantly lower than that in WT
mice at 2 days after ischemia. (Fig. 1D and E).
3.2. Protective effect of capsazepine on neurological deﬁcit and
infarct volume
Gene inactivation is known to result in some cases in the activation of compensatory or redundancy mechanisms that counteract the loss of gene function. Therefore, we investigated the

3.3. No capsazepine protective effect in TRPV1-KO mice after
ischemic brain injury
To conﬁrm that the protective effect of capsazepine was TRPV1speciﬁc, we examined the effect of capsazepine in TRPV1-KO mice.
rCBF was unaffected when vehicle or capsazepine was injected into
TRPV1-KO mice at 30 min before MCA occlusion (Fig. 3A). Additionally, capsazepine had no signiﬁcant effects on neurological
deﬁciency, motor dysfunction, or infarct volume in TRPV1-KO
(Fig. 3B, C, 3D, and 3E), indicating that the protective effects of

481

capsazepine require TRPV1.
3.4. The effect of TRPV1 deﬁciency on microglia/macrophages,
astrocyte, and neutrophil accumulation
Finally, we examined accumulation of microglia/macrophages
and astrocytes in the peri-ischemic area and of neutrophils in the
ischemic core area at 1 and 2 days after ischemia by immunohistochemical staining for Iba1, GFAP, and Gr1, respectively. The
numbers of Iba1-positive microglia/macrophages (Fig. 4A), GFAPpositive astrocytes (Fig. 4B), and Gr1-positive neutrophils
(Fig. 4C) were higher at 1 and 2 days after cerebral ischemia;
however, there were no differences between TRPV1-KO and WT
mice with respect to the increases in the numbers of each cell type.
4. Discussion

Fig. 3. Null effect of capsazepine on infarct volume in TRPV1-deﬁcient mice. (A) Decreases in rCBF in the MCA territory were estimated by Laser-Doppler Flowmetry.
Percent changes from baseline were recorded at baseline, at 5 min after induction of
ischemia, and at 10 min intervals from onset of ischemia to 25 min after reperfusion, in
vehicle- and capsazepine- (20 nmol) treated TRPV1-KO mice. (B) At 1 and 2 days after
reperfusion, the neurological deﬁcits of vehicle- and capsazepine-treated TRPV1-KO
mice (n ¼ 10, respectively) were assessed. (C) At 1 and 2 days after reperfusion, the
motor deﬁcits of vehicle- and capsazepine-treated TRPV1-KO mice (n ¼ 10, respectively) were assessed. (D) Representative images of TTC stained coronal sections obtained from vehicle- and capsazepine-treated TRPV1-KO mice. (E) Infarct volume at 2
days after reperfusion in vehicle- and capsazepine-treated TRPV1-KO mice (n ¼ 10,
respectively).

The present study clearly demonstrated that TRPV1 gene
knockout attenuates neurological deﬁciency and motor dysfunction
and reduces infarct volume after cerebral ischemia. Moreover,
intracerebroventricular injection of capsazepine improved neurological outcome and reduced infarct volume in WT mice, but not in
TRPV1-KO mice. These results suggest strongly that TRPV1 activation has a deleterious effect on the pathophysiology of brain
ischemia.
TRPV1 is expressed in a variety of cell types in both the peripheral and central nervous system [5,6], suggesting that it functions in several cell populations to increase the deleterious effects
of ischemic brain injury. In this study, however, a single injection of
capsazepine into the brain was as effective as global gene deletion
of the TRPV1 gene in attenuating neurological deﬁcit and motor
dysfunction, and reduced infarct volume after ischemic brain
injury, indicating that TRPV1 function at least affects recovery from
ischemic brain injury. Previous reports indicate that TRPV1 is
expressed in microglia [11,12] and astrocytes [13] in the brain. In the
present study, the number of Iba1-immunopositive microglia/
macrophages,
GFAP-immunopositive
astrocytes
Gr1immunopositive neutrophils increased at 1 and 2 days after cerebral ischemia; however, no differences were observed between WT
and TRPV1-KO mice, suggesting that TRPV1 in these cells is not
critical for cerebral ischemic injury.
To date, electrophysiological studies clearly demonstrate that
TRPV1 activation modiﬁes synaptic transmission via both presynaptic [7,8,14e16] and postsynaptic mechanisms [9,10]. Stimulation
of TRPV1 by capsaicin or an endogenous TRPV1 agonist anadamide
increased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic
currents in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars
compacta [7], striatal neurons [14] and subpopulations of periaqueductal gray neurons [15]. Moreover, Shoudai et al. [16] reported that Ca2þ entry through TRPV1 channels triggered tonically
glutamate release independently of voltage-activated calcium
channels in the central terminals of peripheral nerves. These
studies clearly indicate that TRPV1 stimulation potentiates glutamatergic release in the CNS. Considering that glutamate is not only
the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the adult brain, but also
a critical transmitter for the degeneration of signaling neurons
following stroke [17], and that the levels of the TRPV1 endogenous
agonists, palmitoylethanolamide [20] and anandamide [21], in the
brain are elevated in cerebral ischemia, it is conceivable that
atypical and excessive activation of TRPV1 during cerebral ischemia
leads to the pathophysiological deterioration caused by neurotoxicity. Additionally, our previous data show endogenous stimulation
of TRPV1-triggered neurotoxicity in cultured rat cortical neurons
[18], indicating that TRPV1-mediated somatodendritic or postsynaptic Ca2þ inﬂux could directly affect neuronal survival. If the

expression level of TRPV1 is upregulated in the CNS neurons of
stroke patients, as is previously reported in mesial temporal lobe
epilepsy patients [19], the neurotoxicity mediated by TRPV1would
be further enhanced in cerebral ischemia.
Ischemic stroke increases anaerobic glycolysis and lactate
accumulation, and decreases pH (acidosis) [22] in the brain.
It also increases the accumulation of various neurotransmitters
and inﬂammatory substances, including as major pain-causing
substances bradykinin [23] and prostaglandin [24], which can
induce the open state of the multistate TRPV1 receptor via phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) induced by Gq/11-coupled
receptor activation [4]. Additionally, a recent study revealed that
bradykinin-induced PKC phosphorylation causes TRPV1 activation
and potentiates glutamatergic synaptic transmission at the ﬁrst
sensory synapse [25]. Taken together, TRPV1 in neurons could be
activated under ischemic conditions in response to various stimuli,
and this could lead to an increase in neurotoxic glutamate release
and adverse effects on neuronal survival.
Although intracerebroventricular injection of the TRPV1 blocker
capsazepine attenuated ischemic brain injury, nonspeciﬁc effects of
capsazepine might be anticipated, such as inhibition of TRPM8 [26].
In this study, however, the protective effect of capsazepine was not
evident in TRPV1-KO mice, indicating that the attenuation of the
deleterious effects of ischemic brain injury by capsazepine was
TRPV1 speciﬁc.
By contrast, previous research shows that TRPV1 activation exerts protective effects in a rodent ischemia model, possibly by
inducing hypothermia [27,28]. Although an injection of 25 mg/kg
rinvanil, a TRPV1 agonist, induced hypothermia and exerted neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemic injury, a higher dose
(50 mg/kg) did not show any signiﬁcant effect [27], indicating that
excessive stimulation of TRPV1 can adversely affect neuronal survival. Furthermore, we evaluated infarct volume under more severe
conditions than those employed in a previous report using dihydrocapsaicin [28]. Therefore, it is possible that a difference in the
extent of severity of brain injury explains the difference between
our results and those reported previously, although further investigation will be needed to conﬁrm this. In this context, further evidence that peripheral TRPV1 activation is primarily involved in
hypothermia comes from studies showing the involvement of
constitutive activation of TRPV1 channels by protons in the
abdominal viscera in thermoregulation [29] and attenuation of
hyperthermia induced by a TRPV1 antagonist, AMG9810, by the badrenoceptor antagonist propranolol [30]. This notion is further
reinforced by results showing that the TRPV1 antagonist
AS1928370 with high brain penetrability has little effect on hyperthermia [31]. Thus, at low doses of the TRPV1 agonists that do
affect neurons in the CNS, hypothermia-dependent ischemic neuroprotection might be the predominant effect. However, judging
from the contradictory effects of TRPV1 on ischemia, therapeutic
interventions designed to induce hypothermia via TRPV1 activation
could entail a risk of CNS neurotoxicity triggered by mistakenly or
unexpectedly high dose treatments with TRPV1 agonists. Taken
together, selective inhibition of TRPV1 in the CNS with doses of
antagonists that do not affect peripheral TRPV1 activity could be
more effective in preventing TRPV1-mediated neurotoxicity when
used in combination with the well-established cooling system.
In conclusion, we suggest that TRPV1 plays a signiﬁcant role in
ischemic brain injury. TRPV1 could be the promising target for
clinical interventions designed to treat ischemic brain injury.
