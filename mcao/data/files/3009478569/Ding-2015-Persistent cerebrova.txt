Background and Purpose—Diabetes mellitus is a disease with vascular components. Consequently, the blood–brain barrier
disruption after stroke may differ between diabetic and nondiabetic animals. However, few studies have documented the
longitudinal blood–brain barrier disruption afte stroke in diabetic animals. In this study, using MRI, we noninvasively
evaluated the blood–brain barrier damage after middle cerebral artery occlusion in diabetic and nondiabetic rats.
Methods—Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was induced in adult male Wistar rats by administration of a high-fat diet in
combination with a single intraperitoneal injection (35 mg/kg) of streptozotocin. T2DM rats (n=9) and nondiabetic wildtype (WT) rats (n=9) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 2 hours using the filament model. MRI was
performed 1 day and then weekly for 5 weeks after middle cerebral artery occlusion for all rats.
Results—The ischemic lesion volumes after stroke as measured using T2 maps were not significantly different between the
T2DM and WT rats. Compared with the WT rats, the volumes of blood–brain barrier disruption evaluated using contrastenhanced T1-weighted imaging with gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid and the cerebral hemorrhagic
volumes measured with susceptibility-weighted imaging were significantly (P<0.05) larger in the T2DM rats from 1 to 5
weeks after stroke; values of diffusion fractional anisotropy were significantly lower in T2DM rats (P<0.03) than in WT
rats after stroke. These MRI measurements were consistent with histological data.
Conclusions—Using MRI, T2-weighted imaging did not detect significant differences of the ischemic lesion volumes
between T2DM and WT rats. In contrast to the WT rats, however, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging and
susceptibility-weighted imaging identified much more severe ischemic vascular damage, whereas fractional anisotropy
demonstrated lower axonal density in the T2DM rats after stroke.

iabetes mellitus is a chronic vascular disease.1 Hypergly­
cemia induces a variety of biochemical changes within
endothelial cells, including those in the cerebral vasculature.2
Diabetes mellitus instigates a cascade of events leading to
vascular endothelial cell dysfunction and increased vascular
permeability in various vascular beds in humans and animal
models.3 Many pathways are involved in the diabetes melli­
tus–related changes in the blood–brain barrier (BBB).4,5 In the
clinic, the vast majority (90%–95%) of diabetic patients have
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which affects 24 million
Americans.1
Diabetes mellitus increases risk of ischemic stroke more
than hemorrhagic stroke.6 Clinical and experimental results
have demonstrated that diabetes mellitus also increases
stroke recurrence and long-term mortality from stroke and
worsens the overall neurological outcomes after stroke.6–8

Abnormalities in glucose metabolism and vascular hemody­
namics may play important roles in the pathogenic progress of
stroke in diabetic patients.6
Experimental studies have reported inconsistent ischemic
lesion volumes in diabetic rodents compared with nondiabetic
rodents, which may depend on the type and duration of diabetes
mellitus, ischemia model, or the murine strain.8,9 Here, we used
MRI to longitudinally measure the ischemic lesion volumes using
a filament model of stroke in adult rats with or without T2DM
induced by streptozotocin combined with a high-fat diet.10,11
BBB damage and exacerbated secondary hemorrhagic
transformation (HT) are consistent consequences of ischemic
stroke in diabetic murine animals.9,12 However, prior preclini­
cal studies only focused on the measurement of BBB disrup­
tion and cerebral vascular permeability rate at an early stage
after stroke in diabetic animals using histological methods,

which do not allow dynamic evaluation and application to
patients. In the present study, using MRI, the temporal charac­
teristics of BBB disruption were monitored weekly ≤5 weeks
after stroke in the T2DM and nondiabetic wild-type (WT) rats.
These results may provide new information on dynamic and
chronic cerebrovascular damages after stroke in T2DM rats.

Animal Model and Experimental Protocol

Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

T2DM was induced10,11 in adult (175 g; 2–3 months) male Wistar
rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) by feeding them a high-fat
diet (40% of calories as fat) for 2 weeks, and then injecting a single
intraperitoneal dose, 35 mg/kg, of streptozotocin (Zanosar, Sigma
Chemical Co, St. Louis, MO), a naturally occurring chemical that is
particularly toxic to the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas
in mammals, the high-fat diet was continued for another 2 weeks.
Blood glucose level was measured using test strips for glucose
(Polymer Technology System, Indianapolis, IN) for confirmation of
hyperglycemia (449.2±42.6 and 414.2±134.6 mg/dL at 1 day before
and after middle cerebral artery occlusion [MCAo]). Right middle
cerebral artery occlusion was then induced for 2 hours using the fila­
ment model, as previously described.13 Briefly, a 4-0 monofilament
nylon suture, its tip rounded by heating, was introduced into the in­
ternal carotid artery lumen through the stump of the external carotid
artery and gently advanced into the internal carotid artery 19 to 21
mm past the common carotid artery bifurcation to block the origin of
the middle cerebral artery. Reperfusion was initiated through removal
of the thread and tying off the distal external carotid artery. Wistar
rats, fed normal chow (12% of calories as fat) without streptozotocin
injection, received suture-induced ischemia–reperfusion injury and
were used as the WT control rats (blood glucose level, 93.3±2.1 and
90.8±5.6 mg/dL at 1 day before and after MCAo). The control and
T2DM animal groups were age matched.
MRI was performed before the surgery for MCAo, as an internal
control. Then, MRI was performed at 1 day and then weekly for 5
weeks after ischemia–reperfusion for all rats. Three T2DM rats and
1 WT rat died after MCAo and were excluded from the study. After
completing MRI scans, all animals (n=9 for T2DM and n=9 for WT
rats) were euthanized 5 weeks after stroke.

MRI Measurements
MRI measurements were performed with ClinScan 7T system, which
combines Bruker-Biospin hardware (Bruker-Biospin, Ettlingen,
Germany) with Siemens software (Siemens, Erlanger, Germany). A
birdcage type coil was used as the transmitter and a quardrature halfvolume coil as the receiver. Pulse sequences included T2-weighted
imaging, susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), diffusion-weighted
imaging with multiple directions, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted
imaging (CE-T1WI) with gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-ace­
tic acid (Gd-DTPA; Magnevist, Berlex Inc, Montville, NJ), as the im­
age contrast agent.
A fast gradient echo imaging sequence was used for reproducible
positioning of the animal in the magnet at each MRI session. During
MRI measurements, anesthesia was maintained using medical air
(1.0 L/min) with isoflurane (1.0%–1.5%). Stereotactic ear bars were
used to minimize movement, and rectal temperature was maintained
at 37±1.0°C using a feedback-controlled water bath (YSI Inc, Yellow
Springs, OH).
T2-weighted imaging was acquired using a multislice (13 slices)
and multiecho (6 echoes) sequence, with time of echo as 15 ms, and
equally to 90 ms. The time of repetition was 4.5 s. Images were pro­
duced using a 32×32 mm2 field of view, 1-mm slice thickness, and

128×64 matrix. SWI used a specialized 3-dimensional gradient
echo sequence with time of echo, 10 ms; time of repetition, 40
ms; flip angle of 15°, 32×32×24 mm3 field of view, 256×192×64
matrix, and flow compensation in all 3 directions. Diffusionweighted imaging was acquired using a spin-echo sequence with
pulsed diffusion-weighted gradients and one-shot echo-planar
readout. The field of view was 32×32 mm2; 128×128 matrix, 1-mm
slice thickness with 13 slices, time of repetition, 10 s and time of
echo, 50 ms; 1 baseline of b=0 s/mm2; 128 directions of diffusion
gradients with b=1500 s/mm2 for each slice. CE-T1WI was com­
posed of 2 T1WI acquisitions, before and 6 minutes after injection
of Gd-DTPA into a tail vein at a dose of 0.4 mL/kg. T1WI was ac­
quired using a conventional multislice single spin-echo sequence
with time of echo of 8 ms and time of repetition of 500 ms. The
other MRI parameters in T1WI were the same as in T2-weighted
imaging.

Histological Staining
Rats were euthanized with ketamine (44 mg/kg intraperitoneal)
and xylazine (13 mg/kg intraperitoneal). Brains were isolated,
postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days at room tempera­
ture, and then processed for paraffin sectioning. Coronal sections
(6-μm thick) were cut from each block and stained with hema­
toxylin and eosin (H&E) for the evaluation of ischemic lesion
and blood in cerebral parenchymal tissue using light microscopy.
Perls Prussian Blue (PPB) stain was performed for measurement
of iron in cerebral parenchymal tissue, as evidence of hemorrhage.
Double Bielschowsky’s silver and Luxol fast blue staining was
performed for evaluation of axon and myelin.

Data and Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was performed in a blind fashion. MRI image analysis
was generally performed with homemade software, Eigentool.14 T2
maps were obtained pixel-by-pixel using a linear least-squares fit to
the plot of the natural logarithm. SWI was analyzed using SPIN soft­
ware.15 The multidirection diffusion-weighted imaging analysis was
performed using Camino software.16 Fractional anisotropy (FA) map
was derived from the multidirection diffusion-weighted imaging.
Ischemic lesion volumes of MRI were measured on the T2 maps.
The mean plus 2× SD of the contralateral measurements on the T2
maps was used as a threshold to identify lesion volume. To eliminate
the influence of brain atrophy after stroke, the ischemic lesion volume
were calculated and expressed as the ratio of lesion volume to contra­
lateral hemispheric volume. The same measurement was performed
on the subtraction image of pre-Gd T1WI from post-Gd T1WI.17
Because of hypointensity of hemorrhage on the SWI intensity image,
the mean minus 2× SD of the contralateral measurements was used
as threshold to identify HT after stroke.14 T1WI and SWI measure­
ments were presented as the direct volumes. FA measurement was
performed with 1 slice matched the histological section C for each
animal. The difference of ischemic lesion areas obtained from the
same slice of T2 map between 1 day and 5 weeks after stroke was re­
ferred as the recovery region of interest. The FA map was first warped
to the corresponding T2 map; and then, the region of interests within
the striatum were loaded onto the FA map for measurement.
The MicroComputer Imaging Device system (Imaging Research
Inc, Ontario, Canada) was used for histological measurements. H&Eand PPB-stained sections were evaluated at ×20 or ×40 magnifica­
tions, respectively. With Bielschowsky’s silver and Luxol fast blue
staining, 4 locations of the coronal section were used for axonal
density quantification.7 The reactive areas of the recovery region of
interest inside striatum were measured (percentage to field of view)
under a ×40 objective of optical microscope, using an average of all
locations as the histological result.
ANOVA was performed. The effect was detected at the 0.05 level.
Student t test was applied between animal groups of MRI measure­
ments obtained at the same time points. MRI measurements are sum­
marized as mean and SD.

Results
The ischemic lesion volumes quantitatively measured by T2
maps, indicated in Figure 1A, do not exhibit any significant
differences (P>0.05) during the period of 1day to 5 weeks
after stroke between the T2DM (33.8±15.3% at 5 weeks) and
WT (28.7±16.3% at 5 weeks) rats. Representative MRI T2
maps from 1 day to 5 weeks after stroke are shown in Figure 2
for T2DM and WT rats. With the edema declining with time
after stroke, the volume of the ischemic lesion consequently
experienced large changes from 1 day to 1 week after stroke
for all rats (Figure 1A). Small changes of the ischemic volume
were detected starting at 1 week after stroke for both T2DM
and WT animals (Figure 1A). Lesion volumes from T2 maps
exhibited similar temporal profiles for both T2DM and WT
rats (Figure 1A). The infarction volumes measured from the
histological H&E coronal sections using the MicroComputer
Imaging Device system were 37.9±10.4% of the contralateral
hemisphere for the T2DM rats and 27.8±5.9% for the WT rats.
However, no significant differences were detected between the
T2DM and WT rats at 5 weeks after stroke (P>0.05).
Unlike the lesion volumes, BBB disruption volumes of the
T2DM rats measured with CE-T1WI of Gd-DTPA exhibited
significant differences from the WT rats, as quantitatively
demonstrated in Figure 1B. The volumes with Gd-DTPA
enhancement acquired with CE-T1WI were significantly
(P<0.05) larger in the T2DM rats than in the WT rats from 1
to 5 weeks after stroke, which indicates that BBB disruption
was significantly worse in T2DM rats ≤5 weeks after stroke,
compared with the WT rats.
Figure 3 presents subtracted images of precontrast from
postcontrast T1WI for 2 representative animals. The areas
with hyperintensity in the images, which indicated the leakage

of Gd-DTPA through BBB, persisted from 1 to 5 weeks after
stroke in the T2DM rat. However, for the WT rat, subtracted
T1WI images presented hyperintensity areas only at 1 day
after stroke (Figure 3, arrow), which suggested that the BBB
leakage of Gd-DTPA was present only on the first day after
stroke. No evident Gd-DTPA leakage was found after that in
the WT rat.
BBB disruption after ischemia may lead to HT. The hypoin­
tensity areas excluding veins in the SWI images are associ­
ated with hemorrhage.18 Quantitative SWI measurements of
hemorrhagic volumes, as shown in Figure 1C, demonstrated
that the T2DM rats exhibited significantly (P<0.005) larger
hemorrhagic volumes (≈10×) than WT rats from 1 to 5 weeks
after stroke. The representative T2DM and WT rats exhib­
ited different evolutions of the HT after ischemia with SWI
images in Figure 4. From the SWI images, areas of hypoin­
tensity which reflect hemorrhage, indicated by arrowheads in
Figure 4, actively changed morphologically during 1 day to
5 weeks after stroke in the T2DM rat. Although hemorrhage
spots identified in the WT rat changed little, where hemor­
rhage was detected starting at 1 week and no apparent change
was subsequently found to 5 weeks after stroke. The hypoin­
tensity areas are much larger in the T2DM rat than in the WT
rat.
Erythrocytes outside of blood vessels in the cerebral paren­
chymal tissue indicate hemorrhage. Analysis of H&E histo­
logical coronal sections under the light microscope showed
that the red cells were diffusively present in the ischemic
cerebral tissue in the T2DM rat, shown in Figure 5A, whereas
the red blood cells were localized in a smaller region in the
WT rat (Figure 5B). PPB stains were consistent with H&E
stains. The Prussian blue spots outside of blood vessels in the

2 diabetes mellitus (DM; upper row) and wild-type

typical evolutions of the ischemic neuronal damage.

brain parenchymal tissue were larger in size and much darker
in color for the T2DM rat (Figure 5C) than that for the WT rat
(Figure 5D). Combining the histological results of H&E and
PPB staining for short- and long-term hemorrhage, respec­
tively, the T2DM rat evidently had more severe and extensive
hemorrhage after stroke than the WT rat, which coincided
with the MRI measurements.
The temporal profiles of FA values of the recovery striatal
tissue are demonstrated in Figure 1D. The FA values remained
significantly (P<0.02) lower within 5 weeks after stroke for
T2DM rats, compared with the WT group. The mean values
of FA were 0.31±0.08 for the WT group and 0.20±0.05 for
the T2DM group at 5 weeks after stroke. The axonal densi­
ties were histologically measured at 5 weeks after stroke on
Bielschowsky’s silver and Luxol fast blue staining sections, as
24.1±7.7% for the WT group versus 17.4±5.3% for the T2DM
group, which is significantly different (P<0.05) and consistent
with FA measurements. However, the functional outcomes
of the modified Neurological Severity Score8 were margin­
ally different (P<0.06) between the control (5.89±0.60) and
T2DM (6.89±1.27) groups at 5 weeks after MCAo.

Discussion
Clinical data indicate that nondiabetic patients with transient
hyperglycemia have smaller infarction volumes after stroke
than diabetic patients.19 Preclinical results on infarction size in
diabetic and nondiabetic animals are equivocal. Pre-existing
hyperglycemia significantly exacerbates the ischemic lesion
volumes in most brain regions at 4 hours after stroke in adult
Sprague–Dawley rats with a 2-hour/2-hour suture ischemia–
reperfusion injury compared with normoglycemic cohorts.20
However, compared with normoglycemia, the infarct volume
was decreased in hypoglycemic rats and unaltered in acute
diabetes mellitus induced by single streptozotocin injec­
tion 2 days before MCAo. With the T2DM model in GotoKakizaki rats, infarction volumes were significantly smaller
and independent of the 3-hour/21-hour ischemia–reperfusion
filament,9 or 24-hour embolic MCAo models.3 Conversely,
infarction volumes were significantly increased after stroke in
T2DM mice compared with nondiabetic mice.7,12 Thus, there is
a need to delineate the ischemic lesion volume for our animal

model, a T2DM model induced by a single intraperitoneal
injection of low-dose streptozotocin combined with a high-fat
diet, and a 2-hour suture ischemia–reperfusion model in the
young adult Wistar rat. Using dynamic T2-weighted imaging
measurements in the current study, shown in Figure 1A, the
cerebral infarction volume of T2DM rats was not significantly
different from that of nondiabetic controls from 1 day to 5
weeks after stroke. Histological measurements of infarction
at 5 weeks after stroke present consistent results with MRI.
This preclinical result, interestingly, coincides with the clini­
cal outcome.21
Unlike neuronal damage after stroke, more severe vascu­
lar damage has been consistently documented in patients with
stroke and animals with diabetes mellitus.3,4 However, in pre­
vious preclinical reports, BBB disruption and permeability
rate in diabetic animals were regionally measured shortly after
stroke from stained cerebral tissue sections, and measure­
ments were limited to a 1 time measurement using histological
methods.3,7,12 In contrast, using MRI in the present study, lon­
gitudinal measurements of BBB disruption were performed in
stroke rats with or without T2DM from 1 day to 5 weeks after
ischemia–reperfusion stroke. At 24 hours after stroke, T2DM
rats had a marginally larger BBB disruption volume (P<0.08)
than WT rats. The MRI data, as shown in Figure 1B, demon­
strated that T2DM rats exhibited significantly larger volumes
of BBB disruption, as indicated by measurement of Gd-DTPA
leakage, starting from 1 week and persisted to 5 weeks after
stroke (P<0.005), compared with WT rats. These data indi­
cate that BBB disruption after stroke is a long-term problem in
T2DM rats, which persists for ≥5 weeks after stroke. Vascular
remodeling before MCAo in the T2DM rats because of hyper­
glycemia was not separately investigated in this study.
BBB disruption may lead to HT after ischemia. When
blood cells leave a ruptured blood vessel, the erythrocytes die,
and the hemoglobin of the cell is released into the extracel­
lular space. With the hemoglobin losing oxygen, diamagnetic
oxyhemoglobin becomes paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin.
Phagocytic cells engulf the hemoglobin to degrade it, produc­
ing hemosiderin, an iron-storage form, always found within
cells (as opposed to circulating in blood). Thus, hemosiderin
is most commonly found in macrophages and is especially
Figure 4. The evolutions of hemorrhage after ischemia were demonstrated in susceptibility-weighted
imaging (SWI) images for the representative type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM; upper row) and wild-type
(WT; lower row) rats, respectively. Hemorrhagic
spots (arrow heads) were larger and changeable
during 1 day to 5 weeks after stroke in the T2DM
rat, whereas smaller and unchanged hemorrhagic
spots were identified in the WT rat.

appeared in a relative restrictive and smaller region
in the wild-type (WT) rat (black arrow head in

abundant in situations after hemorrhage, which can be identi­
fied histologically by Prussian blue stain, and importantly, by
SWI.22
Because deoxyhemoglobin and hemosiderin present after
hemorrhage, SWI is used to detect the HT after ischemia. As
shown in Figure 1C, hemorrhagic volumes identified by SWI
were significantly larger in T2DM rats than in WT rats from
1 day to 5 weeks after stroke (P<0.05). Histological H&E and
PPB staining pictures (Figure 5) support SWI results, which
show increased hemoglobin (Figure 5A) for new hemor­
rhage and hemosiderin (Figure 5C) for old hemorrhage in the
T2DM rat compared with the WT rat (Figure 5B and 5D),
respectively.
MRI FA was able to monitor well-reorganized white matter,
and FA has been used as an index of white matter recovery
after treatment of stroke in rats.23 In the present study, the tem­
poral profiles of FA measurements (Figure 1D) demonstrated
a significant decrease (P<0.02) in FA of the white matter in
the recovery region of interest extending from the corpus cal­
losum to the boundary of the stroke lesion in the T2DM rats,
in contrast to the WT controls. These data suggest that T2DM
may hamper the white matter reorganization involving the
corpus callosum after stroke. The histological measurements
with Bielschowsky’s silver and Luxol fast blue–stained sec­
tions parallel results as the MRI FA, that is, axonal density
along the ischemic boundary in striatum was significantly
lower (P<0.05) in the T2DM rats than in WT rats at 5 weeks
after stroke. Thus, in the present study, these FA and histologi­
cal results on white matter may coincide with the increased
functional deficits after stroke in diabetic patients and rats3,6
because white matter plays a pivotal role in neurological
functions.

Conclusions
In the present study, measurements based on T2 maps dem­
onstrate no significant difference of ischemic lesion vol­
umes between T2DM and WT rats in 5 weeks after stroke,
using a suture 2-hour occlusion and reperfusion stroke

model and a low-dose streptozotocin injection combined
with a high-fat food diet diabetic model of young adult
Wistar rats. However, compared with WT rats, Gd-DTPA
leakage measured by CE-T1WI indicates that T2DM rats
suffered more severe BBB disruption from 1 to 5 weeks
after stroke (P<0.005), and SWI identified significant larger
hemorrhagic volumes in T2DM rats throughout 5 weeks
after stroke (P<0.05). FA values of ischemic boundary in
the striatum were consistently lower in the T2DM rats than
in the WT controls, which suggest that T2DM hampers axo­
nal density increase. MRI results were consistent with his­
tological measurements.
