showed that some neurons underwent oxidative stress around the ischemic boundary zone at
6 h post-ischemia. Cilostazol treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the percentage of 8-OHdGpositive neurons (65.8733.5% with vehicle and 21.379.9% with cilostazol). Moreover, NADPH
oxidase (NOX) 2-positive neurons were signiﬁcantly reduced with cilostazol treatment. In
contrast, immunohistochemistry results for phosphorylated cyclic-AMP response element
binding protein (pCREB) showed that there were signiﬁcantly more pCREB-positive neurons
around the ischemic boundary zone of cilostazol-treated mice than in those of vehicle-treated
mice at 24 h post-ischemia. These results suggested that cilostazol might have multiple
mechanisms of action to ameliorate ischemic tissue damage, by attenuating oxidative stress
mediated by suppressing NOX2 expression by ischemic neurons and an anti-apoptotic effect
mediated through the pCREB pathway.

Introduction

2.

Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability;
nevertheless, despite intensive research, few treatment
options are available. Numerous neuroprotective drugs have
shown varying degrees of effectiveness in animal stroke
models, but none of these have been found to improve the
outcomes of patients with ischemic stroke (Savitz and Fisher,
2007). In Japan, only edaravone is routinely used in clinical
settings. Because ischemic stroke triggers a number of molecular mechanisms that results in neuron death, a single
neuroprotective agent that affects only one aspect of the
ischemic cascade is unlikely to have any substantial clinical
beneﬁts. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a combination therapy or a single agent that acts on multiple pathways of the ischemic cascade might more successfully
prevent against or ameliorate ischemic injury in acute stroke
(Savitz and Fisher, 2007).
Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3 inhibitor and an
anti-platelet drug, is commonly prescribed for ischemic
stroke during the chronic phase. Recently, the Cilostazol
Stroke Prevention Study (CSPS) II reported that cilostazol
was superior to aspirin for further reducing vascular events
(Shinohara et al., 2010). Additionally, Choi et al. reported that
treatment with cilostazol could reduce the infarct volumes in
a cerebral ischemia model (Choi et al., 2002); subsequently,
numerous researchers have focused on its pleiotropic neuroprotective effects (Table 1).
Although some of its therapeutic mechanisms have been
suggested, the molecular mechanisms involved with cilostazol actions have not been completely determined. Thus, in
the present study, we investigated what effects cilostazol had
in a mouse model of permanent focal ischemia.

Results

2.1.
Cilostazol reduces infarct volumes in a dosedependent manner
Using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining,
infarct volumes were evaluated at 48 h after permanent
MCAo was established. The representative photomicrographs
shown in Fig. 1A indicated that the infarct areas were located
in the ipsilateral neocortex and that treatment with cilostazol
dose-dependently salvaged the tissue damage of the ischemic boundary zones. A quantitative analysis of infarct
volumes indicated that the mean percentage of infarct
volumes was 20.173.8% in the hemispheres of vehicletreated mice. When mice were treated with 10 or 20 mg/kg
of cilostazol, mean infarct volumes decreased to 16.376.2%
(10 mg/kg) or 14.174.9% (20 mg/kg), respectively. Thus, treatment with 20 mg/kg of cilostazol signiﬁcantly reduced the
infarct volumes to 70.1% of those in control mice (Po0.05;
Fig. 1B). We did not ﬁnd any hematoma in the ischemic lesion
of both cilostazol-treated and vehicle-treated animals.

2.2.
Cilostazol reduces neuron oxidative stress around the
ischemic boundary zone
8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (OHdG) is a marker of oxidative
stress, and an immunoreaction against 8-OHdG reﬂects DNA
damage due to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Double immunostaining for 8-OHdG and NeuN, a neuron marker, showed
that some neurons underwent oxidative stress in around the
ischemic boundary zone at 6 h post-ischemia (Fig. 2 A). Treatment with 20 mg/kg of cilostazol reduced the numbers of 8OHdG-positive neurons, and this effect to relieve oxidative

stress was maintained up to 24 h post-ischemia (Fig. 2 A). At
6 h post-ischemia, the percentage of double-positive cells was
65.8733.5% of the total of NeuN-positive cells in vehicletreated mice. With 20 mg/kg of cilostazol, the percentage of 8OHdG-positive neurons was signiﬁcantly reduced to 21.379.9%
(Po0.05; Fig. 2B). The mean percentage of double-positive cells
in cilostazol-treated mice was also signiﬁcantly lower than that
in vehicle-treated mice at 24 h post-ischemia (33.2717.9% in
the cilostazol group and 63.3721.7% in the vehicle group,
Po0.05; Fig. 2B).

2.3.

Cilostazol reduces endothelial cell oxidative stress

The endothelial marker von Willebrand factor (vWF) is
strongly expressed by endothelial cells that are damaged by
ischemic injury. Double immunostaining results for 8-OHdG
and vWF showed that some endothelial cells strongly
expressed vWF around ischemic boundary zones at 6 h
post-ischemia in both vehicle and cilostazol-treated mice.
In addition, some vWF-positive endothelial cells expressed 8OHdG, which indicated a critical condition. At 24 h postischemia, there were more double-positive cells in vehicletreated mice, whereas treatment with 20 mg/kg of cilostazol
did not result in increased double-positive cells; that is,
endothelial cells under oxidative stress (Fig. 3A). In a quantitative analysis for areas occupied by double-positive cells in a
region of interest (ROI), nearly the same results were obtained
for both groups at 6 h post-ischemia (1.4071.45% in vehicletreated mice and 1.2370.70% in cilostazol-treated mice;
Fig. 3B). Although the occupied areas increased in vehicletreated mice at 24 h post-ischemia, treatment with cilostazol
signiﬁcantly restricted this (2.5371.02% in vehicle-treated
mice vs. 0.8070.48% in cilostazol-treated mice, Po0.01;
Fig. 3B).

2.4.
Cilostazol reduces neuron oxidative stress via
suppressing NOX2 expression
Double immunostaining results for NADPH oxidase (NOX) 2
and NeuN showed that some neurons expressed NOX2
around the ischemic boundary zone of vehicle-treated mice
within 6 h post-ischemia (Fig. 4A). However, there were no
NOX2-positive cells that had elongated shapes like those of
endothelial cells. Treatment with 20 mg/kg of cilostazol
reduced the numbers of NOX2-positive neurons at both 6 h
and 24 h post-ischemia (Fig. 4A). Cell count for doublepositive cells was done around ischemic boundary zones,
where neuron oxidative stress was critical. At 6 h postischemia, the mean percentage of double-positive cells was
57.0713.6% of total NeuN-positive cells in vehicle-treated
mice. When 20 mg/kg of cilostazol was administered, the
percentage of NOX2-positive neurons was signiﬁcantly
reduced to 26.5716.7% (Po0.05; Fig. 4B). The percentage of
double-positive cells in cilostazol-treated mice was also
signiﬁcantly lower than that in vehicle-treated mice at 24 h
post-ischemia (31.6719.2% with cilostazol vs. 67.5717.2%
with vehicle, Po0.05; Fig. 4B).

2.5.
Cilostazol maintains CREB phosphorylation in
ischemic neurons
Double immunostaining results for phosphorylated cyclicAMP (cAMP) response element binding protein (pCREB) and
NeuN showed that most of the neurons in ischemic boundary
zones expressed pCREB at 6 h post-ischemia in both groups
(92.076.9% in vehicle-treated mice and 90.879.0% in
cilostazol-treated mice; Fig. 5A and B). The percentage of
pCREB-positive neurons decreased with time in vehicletreated mice (74.578.0% at 24 h post-ischemia, Po0.01),

whereas this percentage remained relatively constant in
cilostazol-treated mice (93.672.9% at 24 h post-ischemia,
Po0.01 vs. vehicle-treated mice).
Moreover, microglia migrate into peri-infarct areas and are
activated post-ischemia. Immunostaining results for Iba1, a
microglial marker, showed that treatment with cilostazol did
not affect the numbers of Iba1-positive cells around ischemic
boundary zones at 24 h post-ischemia (Fig. 6).

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with cilostazol
could protect cerebral tissues from permanent focal ischemia. In cilostazol-treated mice, the numbers of 8-OHdGpositive neurons and NOX2-positive neurons decreased
around ischemic boundary zones. This suggested that cilostazol could attenuate the production of ROS by suppressing
NOX2 activity in ischemic neurons. Moreover, cilostazol
treatment reduced the oxidative stress of endothelial cells
around the ischemic boundary zone. In addition, cilostazol
treatment maintained CREB phosphorylation status in neurons around ischemic boundary zones.
Although cilostazol is an anti-platelet drug and a vasodilator via increased cAMP levels, numerous studies have
reported its pleiotropic effects, such as a neuroprotective
drug in animal stroke models, as shown in Table 1 (Choi
et al., 2002; Honda et al., 2006; Ishiguro et al., 2010; Ito et al.,
2010; Lee et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2004, 2006, 2009; Nonaka et al.,
2009a, 2009b; Omote et al., 2012, 2014; Tanaka et al., 2010;
Toda et al., 2014; Wakida et al., 2006; Ye et al., 2007; Yuzawa
et al., 2008). Various therapeutic mechanisms have been
suggested, although the molecular mechanisms of its actions
have not been completely determined. Choi et al. ﬁrst
reported that cilostazol had neuroprotective effects in that
it could scavenge hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals in in vitro
experiments (Choi et al., 2002). Omote et al. recently showed
that treatment with cilostazol attenuated the oxidative stress
of neurons in stroke-prone spontaneous hypertensive rats
(SHR-SP; (Omote et al., 2012). Toda et al. also reported that
cilostazol attenuated oxidative stress in a transient focal
ischemia model (Toda et al., 2014).
In the present study, although we also showed that cilostazol treatment could attenuate oxidative stress in a permanent
focal ischemia model, we suggest that it suppressed the

production of ROS but did not scavenge ROS. NOX2 is a major
complex for producing ROS during the ischemic period and
aggravates brain damage and neuron cell death after ischemic
injury (Kim et al., 2009; Suh et al., 2008). Kim et al. showed that
casein kinase (CK) 2 was a negative regulator of NOX2 and had a
neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia (Kim et al.,
2009). Interestingly, cilostazol could enhance CK2 phosphorylation and increase its activity (Kim et al., 2004). Thus, we propose
that cilostazol can partly attenuate ischemic damage by suppressing the production of ROS via NOX2 in neurons.
Choi et al. also reported that cilostazol had an antiapoptotic effect mediated by increased Bcl-2 expression,
reduced Bax protein expression, and reduced cytochrome c
release from mitochondria (Choi et al., 2002). Lee et al.
showed that this effect was mediated through the Akt/pCREB
pathway. They found that cilostazol signiﬁcantly increased
the phosphorylation levels of CK 2, Akt, and CREB in association with increased Bcl-2 expression in ischemic areas (Lee
et al., 2004). Mabuchi et al. reported on the phosphorylation
status of CREB by in vitro experiments using cultured neurons that were exposed to glutamate and by in vivo experiments with a transient global ischemia model. Although total
CREB levels were unchanged, pCREB levels increased just
after these insults and then gradually declined (Mabuchi
et al., 2001). In the present study, we showed that pCREB
levels in neurons gradually declined from 6 h to 24 h postischemia in vehicle-treated mice, and that treatment with
cilostazol maintained CREB in a highly phosphorylated state.
Thus, the anti-apoptotic effect on neurons might have been
mediated via the Akt/pCREB pathway around ischemic
boundary zones.
Cilostazol is known to protect not only neurons but also
cerebral endothelial cells, blood-brain barrier (BBB), and neurovascular units (NVUs) from ischemic damage (Ishiguro et al.,
2010; Nonaka et al., 2009b; Omote et al., 2012; Omote et al.,
2014). Hashimoto et al. reported that cilostazol induced nitric
oxide (NO) production by activating endothelial NO synthase
(eNOS) via a cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt dependent mechanism (Hashimoto
et al., 2006). In the present study, we also showed that
cilostazol treatment reduced endothelial cell oxidative stress.
Although the mechanisms involved are unknown, it is possible that cilostazol induces NO via activating eNOS and has a
pleiotropic anti-oxidative effect (Omote et al., 2012). The
treatment with cilostazol may have the risk of hemorrhagic

transformation in the acute phase after stroke. Fortunately, we
did not ﬁnd any hematoma in the cilostazol group, because we
might adopt permanent focal ischemia model, but not transient model. On the other hand, Ishiguro et al. reported that
cilostazol prevents the hemorrhagic transformation induced
by transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice treated with t-PA
(Ishiguro et al., 2010). They suggested that the administration
of cilostazol prevented injury to cerebral endothelial cells and
pericytes.
It is known that another anti-platelet drug, clopidogrel, also
has a pleiotropic neuroprotective effect against cerebral ischemia. Clopidogrel treatment also has an anti-inﬂammatory
effect, as it suppressed microglia that accumulated around
lesions by inhibiting P2Y12 in mice that were subjected to global
cerebral ischemia (Webster et al., 2013). However, cilostazol did
not affect the migration of microglia around the lesions in our
present study.
Finally, we must refer to the limitation in the present
study. It is well known that the infarct area often extends not
only in early phase, but also in the later phase. Thus, the
ischemic boundary zone, where is adjacent to the infarct,
would be included in infarct area by the progression of
ischemia in the later phase, unless any suitable treatments
were given. In the present study, we noticed biochemical
reaction in the ischemic boundary zone in the early phase,
when was in 6 and 24 h after the ischemia. In the cilostazoltreated animals, we thought that the immunohistochemical
ﬁndings around the ischemic boundary zone in the early
phase played a key role to protect against the extension of

59

infarct area in the later phase, 48 h after the ischemia. But the
double dosages of cilostazol were given in the experiment
with TTC staining, on the other hand, the single dosage in the
other experiment with the immunohistochemistry. So we
must care about the discrepancy of the dosage between the
experiments, because there is no evidence whether it has the
same efﬁcacy.
In conclusion, our results suggested that cilostazol might
have multiple mechanisms to ameliorate tissue damage due
to permanent focal cerebral ischemia. Thus, its attenuation of
neuron and endothelial cell oxidative stress and its antiapoptotic effect on neurons mediated through the pCREB
pathway could rescue tissue damage around ischemic
boundary zones.

Experimental procedures

4.1.

Mouse permanent MCAo model

Balb/c mice (8-weeks-old, males) were prepared to establish
permanent focal cerebral ischemia as previously described
(Shichinohe et al., 2004). Brieﬂy, while a mouse was under
anesthesia, a 1.0-cm vertical skin incision was made between
the right eye and ear on the right side. The temporal muscle
was mobilized and the temporal bone was exposed. Under a
surgical microscope, a 2.0-mm burr hole was made just over
the middle cerebral artery (MCA), which was visible through
the temporal bone. The main trunk of MCA was directly

square in left picture with TTC staining indicates the location of the right schematic diagram. ROIs were set around an
ischemic boundary zone (a blue broken circle in right schema). This schema also means that the ischemic boundary zone in
the early phase would be included in infarct area by the progression (a brown broken line and a brown arrow), unless any
suitable treatments were given. A pale blue-painted zone (mentioned as “Core”): ischemic core. A brown-painted zone

occluded with a bipolar coagulator, and complete blood ﬂow
interruption at the occlusion site was conﬁrmed by severing
of the MCA occlusion site. A mouse's core temperature was
maintained between 36.5 1C and 37.5 1C during these procedures. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal
Studies Ethical Committee of Hokkaido University Graduate
School of Medicine.

4.2.

Cilostazol treatment and infarct volume evaluations

Cilostazol was kindly provided by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Three groups of mice were used to assess
lesion sizes. Mice received intraperitoneal injections of either
cilostazol (10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg) or vehicle (n¼ 8/group).
These treatments were administered at 30 min and at 24 h
post-ischemia (Fig. 7A). At 48 h post-ischemia, a mouse was
anesthetized by inhalation of 4.0% isoﬂurane and sacriﬁced
by decapitation (Fig. 7A). Its brain was rapidly removed and
chilled in ice-cold saline for 10 min. Seven 1-mm coronal
slices were prepared with a tissue slicer at 1 mm posterior to
the anterior pole, after which these slices were immersed in a
saline solution with 2.0% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC; Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 1C for 30 min. Slices were then
ﬁxed by immersion in 4.0% phosphate-buffered formalin
solution. All sections were scanned with a digital camera
and infarct areas were quantiﬁed using Image J software,
version 1.45r (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The infarct area in each
slice was determined by subtracting the normal ipsilateral
area from that of the contralateral hemisphere to reduce
errors due to cerebral edema and was expressed as the
percentage of the infarct area to the area of the contralateral
hemisphere. The total infarct volume was determined by
summing the infarct areas for the seven sections (Shichinohe
et al., 2004).

4.3.

Histological analysis

For histological analysis, mice were treated with 20 mg/kg of
cilostazol or vehicle at 30 min post-ischemia (n ¼10/group).
Mice were sacriﬁced at 6 h or 24 h post-ischemia (Fig. 7A).
Their brains were removed and embedded in parafﬁn, and 4μm-thick coronal sections were prepared for staining. The
spatial details of desired sections were in the range from A
1.0 mm to P 1.0 mm of the bregma. The deparafﬁnized
sections were processed through antigen retrieve for 2 min
by pressure pot. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was
performed by ﬁrst reacting sections with a primary antibody
against either 8-OHdG (mouse monoclonal, 1:100, JaICA,
Fukuroi, Shizuoka, Japan), NOX2 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:100,
Bioss Inc., Boston, MA), or pCREB (rabbit polyclonal, 1:100,
Applied Biological Materials, Richmond, BC, Canada) at 4 1C
overnight. Sections were then reacted with Alexa Fluor 594conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200, Molecular Probes) at
4 1C for 4 h. Subsequently, they were incubated with antibodies against either NeuN (mouse monoclonal, 1:400, Chemicon) or vWF (rabbit polyclonal, 1:100, Chemicon) tagged
with a ﬂuorescent label (Zenon Alexa Fluor 488 Labeling Kit,
Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 1 h. About Iba1
(rabbit polyclonal, 1:2000, Wako, Osaka, Japan) staining, sections were incubated at 4 1C overnight, and then reacted with

Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200,
Molecular Probes) at 4 1C for 4 h. At last, they were counterstained with 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; SigmaAldrich). Fluorescent signals were observed through appropriate ﬁlters using a ﬂuorescence microscope (BX61; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and digitally photographed using a cooled
charged-coupled device (CCD) camera (model VB-6000; Keyence Corporation, Osaka, Japan). For quantitative analysis, we
used Image J software (Ver. 1.45r) to measure cell numbers or
the area occupied by cells in a region of interest (ROI: n¼5/
group). All ROIs were set around the ischemic boundary zone,
where we could ﬁnd the existence of neurons and adjacent to
the infarct area (Fig. 7B).

Statistical analysis

Results are presented as mean7standard deviation (SD).
Results were compared using unpaired t-tests for two groups
or one-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher's protected least signiﬁcant difference post-hoc tests for
more than two groups. A P-value of o0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.
