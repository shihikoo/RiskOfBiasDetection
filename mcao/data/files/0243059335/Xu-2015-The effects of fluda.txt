Abstract Cerebral ischemic injury involves a variety of cellular and molecular events. Signal transducers and activators
of transcription-1 (STAT-1) activation is associated with neuronal cell death and contributes to ischemic injury. The effects
of fludarabine, a specific inhibitor of STAT1 protein, on
cerebral ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury were studied in a
rat model. Rats subjected to I/R injury were either treated with
intra-cerebroventricular injection of fludarabine (5,000 μM,
10 μl) or saline 20 min before middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). MR examinations including T2-weighted imaging
(T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and perfusionweighted imaging (PWI) were performed after I/R period.
Then rat brains were sectioned for triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) stains, analyzed by Western blot and TUNEL
staining of apoptosis. It was found that fludarabine treatment
decreased the infarct volume of the cerebrum and the number
of apoptotic neural cells in the ischemic brain. Compared to
saline-treated group, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)
and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the ischemic region were
greater, and the mean transit time (MTT) was shortened in the
fludarabine-treated group. Moreover, fludarabine inhibited the
expression level of phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1) in
neural cells after I/R injury, whereas the expression of

phosphorylated STAT3 (P-STAT3) was increased. Therefore,
we concluded that fludarabine administrated in early stage of
cerebral ischemia had neuroprotective effects, and the underlying mechanism could be mediated through inhibiting
STAT1 phosphorylation and activating the cross regulation
between STAT1 and STAT3 in neural cells.

Introduction
Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) factors, a family of transcription factors composed of seven
members: STAT1, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5a, STAT5b,
and STAT6, are activated by Janus kinases (JAKs) and
mitogen-activated protein (MAP) induced by extracellular
binding of cytokines. STATs have been shown to play a role
in development, cell growth, proliferation, and apoptotic cell
death (Mui 1999). Particularly, STATs are activated in the
central nervous system (CNS) in response to multiple cytokines and growth factors that are released after ischemic
injury. Interestingly, however, different STATs play different
roles in injured tissues. STAT3 promotes neuronal survival,
while STAT1 is associated with neuronal cell death after
ischemic brain or nerve injury (Stephanou and Latchman
2003, Dziennis and Alkayed 2008). Moreover, activation of
STAT1 is also found to be required for the enhancement of
cardiomyocyte cell death during ischemic/reperfusion (I/R;
Stephanou et al. 2000a, 2001, 2002).
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major constituent
of green tea, reduces STAT1 activation and the expression of
its pro-apoptotic target genes and also protects cardiac
myocytes against I/R-induced cell death (Townsend et al.
2004). Hyperforin, the non-polyphenolic compound exerts

290

strong anti-STAT1 action and efficiently attenuates cytokineinduced cytotoxicity in a pancreatic beta-cell line (Menegazzi
et al. 2008). Theaflavin, a major constituent of black tea,
ameliorates cerebral I/R injury in rats through its antiinflammatory effects and inhibition of P-STAT1 (Cai et al.
2006). Silymarin, an antioxidant drug, has been reported to
protect rats from cerebral I/R-induced stroke injury through
impairing NF-κB and STAT-1 activation (Hou et al. 2010).
Thus, STAT1 serves as an important pharmacological inhibitor target for therapeutic interventions in brain I/R injury.
Fludarabine, an adenosine nucleoside analog, has a marked
effect on several key enzymes involved in DNA synthesis and
DNA repair. Clinically, fludarabine has been revealed to be
actively effective in the treatment of several hematological
malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia,
Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, and low-grade lymphoma
(Keating et al. 1993). Furthermore, Fludarabine is also a
potent inhibitor of STAT1 and can cause a specific depletion
of STAT1 protein but not of other STATs in the peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC; Frank et al. 1999). Researchers found that fludarabine markedly inhibited vascular
smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation under in vitro and
in vivo conditions and accelerated bone fracture healing
through the molecular switch-off of STAT-1 activation
(Torella et al. 2007, 2010). Accordingly, the regulatory role
of fludarabine through its inhibition of STAT1 in neuronal cells
after cerebral I/R-induced injury remains to be investigated.
In our study, in vivo MR imaging of cerebral ischemic rat
model induced by I/R injury was carried out to evaluate the
effects of fludarabine. In vitro triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining was conducted to evaluate the infarct area, and
Western blot assay was performed to detect the expression
levels of STAT proteins and their phosphorylation status.
Subsequently, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay in neural cells was conducted
to further investigate the apoptosis in cerebral ischemic region.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Protocol
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 220–330 g were
housed at room temperature under a controlled 12 h light/dark
cycle and allowed access to food and water ad libitum. Rats
were divided into four groups and each group had ten animals.
Group one was the sham group, whereas the second group
was subjected to I/R, in which animals were subjected to 2 h
ischemia and 24 h reperfusion. The third and fourth groups
were saline (10 μl) and fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate for
injection provided by Schering, 5,000 μM, 10 μl) treated
ones, respectively. Fludatabine was dissolved in 0.9 % normal
saline, and the intra-cerebroventricular injection of

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 55:289–296

fludarabine or saline was conducted 20 min before the
ischemia.
Animal Model
All animal procedures and protocols were performed in accordance with The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (NIH publication, 85-23, revised 1996) and were
reviewed and approved by the Animal Research Committee
at our institute. Focal cerebral ischemia was produced by
occluding the left middle cerebral artery according to the
methods by Longa et al. (1989). Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg) through intraperitoneal injection. Through a midline neck incision, the left
common and external carotid artery were isolated from muscles and coagulated. A nylon suture with a blunted tip was
inserted into the internal carotid through the external carotid
artery stump and advanced up to about 2 mm. After 2 h of
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), the suture was
removed to restore blood flow. In the sham group, the same
surgical procedure was performed except that the suture was
introduced into the external carotid artery but not advanced.
After surgery, the incision was sutured and the rats were
returned to their cage with free access to water and food.
24 h after reperfusion and MR examinations, the rats were
sacrificed by rapid decapitation under deep anesthesia and
their brains were taken out for biochemical estimations.
MR Image Acquisition
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, all rats were examined
using Signa HD 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scanner (GE, USA) with a radio frequency (RF) coil for
animal. The head of rats were put in the middle of the coil
under deep anesthesia in prone position. T2-weighted imaging
(T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and perfusionweighted imaging (PWI) coronal images were obtained after
scanning the scout view. The scanning parameters were listed
in Table 1. PWI included 40 times scans, and gadolinium
diethylene-trianmine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA, 1.5 ml/kg)
was injected after the fourth time scanning through the remaining needle of femoral vein in 2–3 s. The infarct size was
determined from the hyperintensity region in T2WI. The
cerebral ischemic area and its boundary were manually traced
and mirrored onto the contralateral side in each slice. Voxels in
the lesion area with image intensities higher than the mean+2
standard deviations of the intensity in the mirrored contralateral area were defined as the infarct zone (Chan et al. 2009).
Infarct volume was obtained according to the indirect method
and corrected for edema. The accurate infarct area was calculated as the total area of infarct area − (ischemic hemisphere
area − contralateral hemisphere area) (Swanson et al. 1990).
The edema area was calculated as ischemic hemisphere area −

contralateral hemisphere area. The infarct volume was
expressed as a percentage (%) of the whole brain volume.
Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were calculated
from the DWI data, and PWI data was computed to create NEI
and MTE maps using a workstation (adw4.2, GE, USA). The
values of ADC, NEI, and MTE were then measured in the
ischemic slice and the mirrored contralateral region. The
relative value of ADC (rADC), the relative value of NEI
(rNEI), and the relative value of MTE (rMTE) were evaluated
as a ratio of the ischemic region to the contralateral hemisphere. NEI was equivalent to cerebral blood volume (CBV),
and MTE was equivalent to mean transit time (MTT).
Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride (TTC) Staining
Brains were cut into coronal slices of 2 mm in thickness.
These slices were stained for 20 min in a 2 % triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and fixed in 10 % buffered formalin
solution. The stained slices were photographed by a digital
camera and measured for the ischemic lesion by image process software (ADOBE, PHOTOSHOP 7.0, USA). The infarct volume percentage (%) was then calculated with the
same method as MRI scan mentioned above.

and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The immunoblots were
visualized using Odyssey IR fluorescent scanning formatter
(LI-COR, USA).
Cell Apoptosis Assay
The apoptotic state of neuronal cells was detected by TUNEL
method, using the in situ cell death detection kit (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after deparaffinage,
digestion with proteinase K and quenching of endogenous
peroxidase in 3 % H2O2, formalin-fixed brain sections were
incubated with the TdT enzyme and fluorescein-labelled nucleotides at 37 °C for 60 min and further incubated with a
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody
at 37 °C for 30 min, and finally incubated with a substrate
diaminobenzidine (DAB) for 3–6 min. Sections were then
counter-stained with hematoxylin. Negative controls were
produced by omitting the TdT enzyme. The number of
TUNEL-positive cells was counted in the infarct area of
ipsilateral cortex and striatum of each rat, and five fields
(×400 magnification) were counted in each case.

Western Blot Analysis
Statistical Analysis
The infarct brain tissues according to MR imaging were
removed and used for Western analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and all samples were adjusted to an
equal protein content before analysis. Samples (100 μg of
total protein) were separated on 10 % denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (40 mA, 97 min; transfer
buffer 25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 20 % methanol) by an
electroblotter (Bio-Rad). After being blocked for 1 h at room
temperature in blocking buffer (5 % nonfat milk in 20 mM
Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 140 mM NaCl, 0.5 % Tween 20), membranes were incubated over night at 4 °C with primary antibodies against antiphospho-STAT-1 at Tyr-701 (Bioworld
Technology, USA), anti-STAT-1 (Bioworld Technology,
USA), antiphospho-STAT-3 at Tyr-705 (Cell Signaling Technology, USA), or anti-STAT-3 (Cell Signaling Technology,
USA). Membranes were then washed in wash buffer (in

All data were analyzed using the statistical software SPSS
(version 17.0). Statistical differences between different groups
were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK) test. P value less than 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Effect of Fludarabine on T2WI, DWI, and PWI
In T2-weighted images, the infarction percentage in
fludarabine-treated group showed significant decrease compared to that in I/R- and saline-treated groups (P<0.05, Fig. 1,
Table 2), whereas the values of rADC and rCBV increased
(P<0.05, Table 2). An obvious reduction of rMTT was also
observed in fludarabine-treated group in contrast to I/R- and

(P<0.05, Fig. 2, Table 3), indicating fuldarabine had remarkably therapeutic effect in reducing the ischemic region induced by I/R injury.

Characterization of the Effect of Fludarabine by TTC Staining

Effect of Fludarabine on STAT1, P-STAT1, STAT3,
and P-STAT3 Protein Expression

In I/R- and saline-treated groups, TTC staining revealed a
larger infarct area in the cortex and striatum of the left hemisphere as compared with the sham group. On the contrary,
fludarabine-treated group demonstrated a significant decrease
in the infarction percentage compared to the above two groups

Previously, STAT1 was found to be constitutively expressed
in protein extracts of brain homogenates (De-Fraja et al. 1998)
and after 2-h ischemia, phosphorylation of STAT1 could be
found by probing with site-specific phospho-STAT1 antibodies. Additionally, phosphorylation of STAT3 was also reported

Fig. 2 In the sham group (A),
there was no ischemic region
assessed by TTC staining. In I/R
group (B) and saline-treated
group (C), TTC staining revealed
a large infarct area in the cortex
and striatum of the left
hemisphere. However, in
fludarabine-treated group (D),
TTC straining showed a
significant decrease in the volume
compared to the above groups

to be upregulated after cerebral ischemia (Planas et al. 1996).
In our study, we aimed to detect whether administration of
fludarabine could alter the expression and phosphorylation
levels of STAT1 and STAT3. No distinct expression levels of
STAT1 and STAT3 were detected among the sham group and
other three experimental groups. However, the phosphorylation levels of both STAT1 and STAT3 were markedly enhanced in I/R- and saline-treated groups. After fludarabine
treatment, neural cells showed decreased P-STAT1 and increased P-STAT3 levels (Fig. 3).

Effect of Fludarabine on Apoptosis of Neural Cells
The protective effects of fludarabine on neural cell apoptosis
induced by I/R injury were then assessed by TUNEL staining.
Apoptotic neural cells with irregular shape and abnormal
nuclei can be stained brown using the TUNEL kit. As is
shown in Fig. 4, in I/R- and saline-treated groups, lots of
apoptotic cells can be found, whereas fludarabine exposure
significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells
(P<0.05, Table 3, Fig. 4) and hence greatly reduced the
cytotoxic effects after I/R injury.

Discussion
In clinical studies, a decrease in the value of ADC, apparent as
hyperintensity on DWI, indicates a restriction in the diffusional movement of water and is believed to result from energy
failure and subsequent cytotoxic edema (Moseley et al. 1990;
Hossmann and Hoehn-Berlage 1995). Other functional

Fig. 3 Western blot of STAT1, P-STAT1, STAT3, and P-STAT3 in the
ischemic cerebrum of sham group, I/R group, saline-treated group, and
fludarabine-treated group. There was no obvious significance in the
expressions of STAT1 and STAT3 in four groups. I/R group and salinetreated group showed markedly increased levels of P-STAT1 and PSTAT3, compared to sham group. Pretreatment with fludarabine demonstrated decreased P-STAT1, while the expression of P-STAT3 increased

parameters like CBVand MTT, generated from the raw data of
PWI, can also provide information on the hemodynamic status
of the tissue and can detect impaired perfusion in the ischemic
areas, therefore complementing the information derived from
DWI (Sorensen et al. 1996; Warach et al. 1996; Baird and
Warach 1998). Patterns of ADC, CBV, and MTT reduction
during the ischemic period reflect the severity of ischemia. In our study, within the ischemic region, higher
values of rADC, rCBV, and shortened rMTT are found
in fludarabine-treated group compared to I/R- and
saline-treated groups, which demonstrates fludarabine
treatment is able to contribute to neural protection and
attenuate cytotoxic edema after cerebral I/R injury.
Meanwhile, MR imaging techniques are also used
in vivo to “target” biochemical analysis to determine
the location of ROI (cerebral ischemic region), regardless of individual variations in lesion size and location.

Our in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrate fludarabinetreated rats exhibit smaller infarct volume compared to I/Rand saline-treated groups either by MRI imaging or TTC
staining. As a nucleoside, fludarabine is widely used in the
treatment of hematologic malignancies and our research team
is the first one to test the efficacy of this drug in the treatment
of cerebral ischemia. Our research shows pretreatment with
fludarabine indeed protects rat brains from I/R injury as it can
significantly decrease the infarct area. We adopt the method of
intra-cerebroventricular injection as the drug can directly
reach the ischemic regions and execute its effects very soon.
Because fludarabine has already been identified as a specific
and potent inhibitor of STAT1 in various cell types such as
PBMC, VSMC, and osteoblasts (Frank et al. 1999; Torella
et al. 2007; Tajima et al. 2010), we proceed to analyze its
effects on the expressions of STAT1 and P-STAT1 in cerebral
ischemic regions.
Western blot shows no variation in the expression level of
STAT1 in normal brain, I/R injury, and fludarabine-treated I//
R tissues. However, the phosphorylation level of STAT1 is
increased in I/R injury group as compared with that in normal
brain tissue. After pretreatment with fludarabine, the expression level of P-STAT1 in the ischemic region is obviously
reduced. As we know, STAT1 plays an important role in
promoting apoptotic cell death through the mechanism that
growth inhibiting and pro-apoptotic activities of IFNs are
largely mediated by STAT1 signaling (Battle and Frank
2002). Several reports have suggested that STAT1 regulates
apoptosis in cardiomyocytes by upregulating proapoptotic factors, such as caspase-1, FAS, and FASL
(Stephanou et al. 2000a, 2001, 2002), and decreasing
the expression levels of anti-apoptotic gene B-cell
lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma-2-associated
X protein (Bcl-x) after I/R injury (Stephanou et al.
2000b). Other reports also reveal that in MCAO mice,
STAT1 promotes apoptosis and cell death by enhancing Akt
phosphorylation, caspase-3, and FAS expression (Takagi
et al. 2002; West et al. 2004). Accordingly, we next analyze
the apoptotic status of neural cells located in the cerebral
ischemic region.

apoptotic neural cells. Apoptosis was significantly decreased in
fludarabine-treated group (D)

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 55:289–296

TUNEL analysis reveals prominent apoptosis occurs in
neural cells following I/R injury, and pretreatment with
fludarabine attenuates the apoptosis of neural cells. Thus, we
assume that the neural protective function of fludarabine on
the ischemic brain may effect through inhibiting the apoptosis
mediated by STAT1. However, a previous study indicates that
fludarabine treatment induces a high percentage of apoptosis
in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells without strong suppression of STAT-1 (Martinez-Lostao et al.
2005), which seems to be contradictory to our study. Our
explanation is that the anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic effect
of fludarabine takes place in a tissue-specific or cell typespecific manner. However, the exact molecular mechanism
underlying why fludarabine can only execute its antiapoptotic effect in ischemic neural cells and pro-apoptotic
function in other cell types remains to be further investigated.
Recent studies reveal that cross-regulation among the
STATs plays a vital role in the maintenance of cytokine
signaling specificity. For example, IL-6 stimulation can activate both STAT1 and STAT3, resulting in the formation of
three distinct dimmers (STAT1–STAT1, STAT1–STAT3, and
STAT3–STAT3; Kim and Lee 2007). Moreover, constitutively
activated STAT3 protects fibroblasts from serum withdrawal
and UV-induced apoptosis, and antagonizes the pro-apoptotic
effects of activated STAT1 in response to IFN-γ (Shen et al.
2001). IFN-γ stimulation predominantly activates STAT1 and
reduces the activation of STAT3. Taken together, these results
suggest there is a tightly regulated cross-regulation existing
between STAT1 and STAT3. Therefore, in our study, we also
aim to investigate if the activation of STAT1 is inhibited by
fludarabine and whether the activation of STAT3 is altered
following cerebral I/R injury. What we find out is that the
phosphorylation levels of both STAT1 and STAT3 are greatly
enhanced following I/R injury. However, pretreatment with
fludarabine suppresses the expression level of P-STAT1,
whereas, on the contrary, the phosphorylation level of STAT3
further increases, which suggests the cross-regulation between
P-STAT1 and P-STAT3 does also exist in fludarabinepretreated cerebral I/R injury tissue. It is well known that
STAT3 is involved with neuroprotection by inducing neuroprotective genes like bcl-2 and bcl-xL (Stephanou et al.
2000b; Komine-Kobayashi et al. 2006; Dziennis et al.
2007), whereas STAT1 promotes neurodegeneration by inducing apoptotic and other cell death promoting genes. Decreased
P-STAT1 and accordingly increased P-STAT3 induced by
fludarabine may collectively contribute to neural protection
after I/R injury.
In conclusion, the present study suggests that, fludarabine,
administrated in early stage of cerebral ischemia, has neuroprotective effects, and the underlying mechanism could be
mediated through inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation, activating the cross regulation between P-STAT1 and P-STAT3 and
hence further phosphorylating STAT3 in neuronal cells.
