responses in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the role and underlying mechanisms of IL-33 in ischemic stroke remain poorly understood. Here, adult male C57BL/6 mice
were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for stroke induction. The MCAO
procedure resulted in the enhanced Th1 and Th17 immune responses from 6 h after
transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion even up to day 3. Meanwhile, the protein and
mRNA level of IL-33 expression was signiﬁcantly decreased at 6 h and 72 h, but not at 24 h
after MCAO. Moreover, recombinant mouse IL-33 administration substantially attenuated
ischemic brain damage and neurological deﬁcit at 24 h and 72 h, but not at 6 h after MCAO.
Interestingly, the reduced CNS inﬂammation in IL-33-treated MCAO mice may be at least
partly due to an induced immuno-shift of Th cells from Th1 to Th2 response and
suppressing Th17 immune response. These ﬁndings demonstrate that IL-33 can play a
protective role after MCAO and may be a new target for therapy of ischemic stroke.

Introduction

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.
The most common type of stroke is ischemic stroke, which
causes cerebral ischemia with activation of an inﬂammatory
response leading to the exacerbation of primary brain injury.
Although the etiology and mechanisms of ischemic stroke is
complex and still not clear, it is considered that inﬂammation
plays a signiﬁcant role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke
(Huang et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2007; Shichita et al., 2012). A
clinical study has shown that the extent of inﬂammatory
response is correlate with the severity of brain injury and
long-term outcomes in stroke patients (Worthmann et al.,
2010). Further understanding post-stroke inﬂammation will
provide potential targets for stroke management and functional recovery.
T cells and their subsets play critical roles in inﬂammation-mediated brain injury (Arumugam et al., 2005; Gu
et al., 2012). Th1 cells promote inﬂammation and the following secondary brain damage and Th2 cells promote antiinﬂammatory responses reducing secondary brain injury (Gee
et al., 2007). Therefore, Th1/Th2 balance could be the clue of a
regulated inﬂammatory response. Moreover, the previous
clinical study has shown that the ratio of Th17 cells in the
peripheral blood of patients with acute cerebral infarction
was positively correlated to infarct size, suggesting that Th17
responses are associated to worsen outcome after stroke (Li
et al., 2005). Animal researches have also found that, with the
progression of cerebral ischemia, Th17 cells induced by γδT
cells and the increased IL-6 and TGF-β could secret massive
IL-17, aggravating the delayed phase inﬂammation (Martin
et al., 2009; Sutton et al., 2009; Yin and Li, 2011). Thus,
neuroprotective strategies could either serve to enhance the
Th2 response after stroke or prevent the Th1 and Th17
response.
Interleukin (IL)-33 was recently identiﬁed as a novel member
of the IL-1 cytokine family (Schmitz et al., 2005). It can function
both as a traditional cytokine and as an intracellular nuclear
factor regulating gene transcription (Miller, 2011). Furthermore,
IL-33 is also thought to be an ‘alarmin’ released from necrotic
cells to alert tissue damage or stress (Haraldsen et al., 2009;
Lamkanﬁ and Dixit, 2009). By interacting with its receptor ST2L,
which is selectively expressed on Th2 cells (Lohning et al., 1998;
Xu et al., 1998), IL-33 can promote the pathogenesis of Th2related diseases such as asthma, atopic dermatitis and anaphylaxis (Pushparaj et al., 2009; Lloyd, 2010; Cevikbas and Steinhoff,
2012). However, IL-33 has shown various protective effects in
cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and several
Th1-mediated inﬂammatory diseases such as experimental
colitis through turning the Th1/Th2 balance toward Th2 cells
(Miller et al., 2008; Duan et al., 2012). In mice with diabetes
mellitus, the reduction of IL-33 expression may exaggerate
ischemia/reperfusion-induced myocardial injury, suggesting a
protective role of IL-33 in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (Rui
et al., 2012). Moreover, recent researches have also found that
IL-33 can regulate Th17 response in several autoimmune
diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis
(Xu et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2012). Thus, IL-33 has pleiotropic
effects on regulating immune responses.

87

In humans and rodents, IL-33 is broadly expressed in
many tissues including brain and spinal cord, indicating that
IL-33 may have central nervous system (CNS)-speciﬁc functions (Schmitz et al., 2005; Yasuoka et al., 2011). Under
conditions such as experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage,
the expression and activity of IL-33 was increased, hinting
that IL-33 may contribute to hypoxic and vascular damage in
the CNS (Onda et al., 1999). Recently, it was reported that
IL-33 production was decreased in the brains of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) patients, and this ﬁnding also implies that IL-33
may have a neuroprotective effect in AD by reducing
β-amyloid peptide secretion and activating microglia to increase its phagocytosis (Chapuis et al., 2009). Thus, IL-33 may
have a role in regulating pathophysiology and inﬂammatory
responses in the CNS diseases. A recent study has shown that
IL-33 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms may be associated with ischemic stroke in north Chinese population (Guo
et al., 2013). However, as an inducer of Th2 immune responses, the precise role of IL-33 in ischemic stroke still remains unknown.
To explore the role of IL-33 in the etiology and mechanisms
of ischemic stroke, we ﬁrst observed the expression level of IL33 in the ischemic brain by using the middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) model in mice, and determined the effect of
treatment with recombinant mouse IL-33 on ishemic brain
injury and the possible immunological mechanism.

Results

2.1.
Focal cerebral ischemia stimulates Th1 and Th17
immune response in the brain
To conﬁrm the effect of transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
on T-cell immune response, single cell suspensions from the
ischemic brain at 6 h, 24 h and 72 h after MCAO were prepared,
stained for cell surface and intracellular markers, and analyzed
by FACS. We measured the percentages of IFN-γþ cells, IL-4þ
cells and IL-17þ cells which represented the amount of T helper
1 (Th1), Th2 and Th17 cells in the ischemic hemisphere,
respectively. Compared to the corresponding sham-operated
groups, the frequency of IFN-γþ and IL-17þ cells was increased
from 6 h to 72 h after MCAO (Fig. 1A, B and E), while no obvious
change in the frequency of IL-4þ cells could be observed (Fig. 1A
and C). Hence, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the Th1/Th2
ratio after MCAO (Fig. 1D).

2.2.
Focal cerebral ischemia regulates the expression level
of IL-33 in the brain
To identify the involvement of IL-33 in post-ischemic inﬂammation, we examined the expression level of IL-33 mRNA and
protein in the ischemic brain tissue after MCAO. Compared to
the corresponding sham-operated groups, both the protein and
mRNA level of IL-33 were signiﬁcantly decreased at 6 h and 72 h
after MCAO, while the change of IL-33 expression was not
obvious at 24 h after MCAO (Fig. 2A–D). This result suggested
that the general trend of IL-33 expression was decreased after
MCAO, and IL-33 signaling may play a role in regulating the
inﬂammatory response during stroke.

2.3.
Recombinant mouse IL-33 attenuates the severity of
brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia
After observing the expression of IL-33 after MCAO, we then
investigated the effect of exogenous IL-33 on ischemic brain
injury. Recombinant mouse IL-33 solution was given as a single
dose (2 μg) by intracerebroventricular injection (ICV) 30 min prior
to MCAO. Further, we compared the IL-33-treated MCAO group
with the control (PBS-treated MCAO group) for neurological
behavior scores, brain edema and infarct volume at 6 h, 24 h
and 72 h after MCAO. Signiﬁcantly improved neurological deﬁcit
scores were observed in IL-33-treated MCAO groups at 24 h
(2.070.302 versus 2.87570.125, po0.05) and 72 h (1.83370.167
versus 2.91770.193, po0.05), respectively (Fig. 3A). The water
contents in IL-33-treated MCAO mice were reduced by 4.56% at
24 h and 5.35% at 72 h, when compared to PBS-treated MCAO
mice (Fig. 3B). Infarct size in the IL-33-treated MCAO group also
decreased signiﬁcantly compared to the PBS-treated MCAO
group at 24 h (21.8974.8% versus 36.2771.6%, po0.05) and 72 h
(8.5274.17% versus 37.0873.35%, po0.05) (Fig. 3C and D). However, there were no signiﬁcant differences between the treated
group and control group in neurological behavior scores (2.677
0.494 versus 2.670.267, p40.05), water content (79.5671.56%
versus 80.1171.81%, p40.05) and infarct volume (34.0273.0%
versus 33.2573.9%, p40.05) at 6 h after MCAO (Fig. 3A–D).

2.4.
The protective effect of IL-33 on ischemic brain
damage is related to modulating T cell subsets in the brain
To further determine the possible immunological mechanisms associated with the reduced severity of ischemic brain
injury in the IL-33-treated MCAO mice, we examined the
cellular phenotypes by FACS, including Th1, Th2 and Th17
cells. As compared to that in PBS-treated MCAO mice, there
was a signiﬁcant decrease in the frequency of IFN-γþ and IL17þ cells and the increase in the percentage of IL-4þ cells

from IL-33-treated mice at 24 h and 72 h after MCAO (Fig. 4A–
C and E). Due to the change in the amount of IFN-γþ and IL-4þ
cells, the Th1/Th2 ratio in the ischemic brain of mice treated
with IL-33 was reduced to the normal level at 24 h and 72 h
after MCAO (Fig. 4D). Nevertheless, there were no signiﬁcant
differences between the treated group and control group in
the above T cell subsets at 6 h after MCAO (Fig. 4A–E).

2.5.
IL-33 alters the levels of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17 in the
serum after focal cerebral ischemia
We also examined the cytokine production in the serum of
MCAO mice treated with IL-33. Serum samples were collected
at 6 h, 24 h and 72 h after MCAO, and analyzed by ELISA for
IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17. Consistent with the cellular phenotype
proﬁles observed in the ischemic brain, the amount of serum
IFN-γ and IL-17 was signiﬁcantly decreased, while the level of
IL-4 was signiﬁcantly increased in the IL-33-treated group
compared with that in the control group at 24 h and 72 h after
MCAO (Fig. 5), suggesting that IL-33 treatment induced
immuno-shift of Th cells from Th1 to Th2 type response and
suppressed Th17 response. However, there were no signiﬁcant
differences between the treated group and control group in the
levels of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-17 at 6 h after MCAO (Fig. 5).

Discussion

The present study ﬁrstly examined the expression pattern of
IL-33 after MCAO in mice, and found that the general trend of
IL-33 expression was decreased. Furthermore, we demonstrated that IL-33 treatment intracerebroventricularly may
attenuate brain injury severity at 24 h and 72 h after MCAO.
The protective effect of IL-33 was associated with inhibition of
neuroinﬂammation via turning the Th1/Th2 balance toward
Th2 cells and suppressing Th17-type immune response.

The role of T lymphocyte-mediated inﬂammation in
ischemic brain injury has received increasing attention. Following an ischemic stroke, T lymphocytes become activated,
enter the brain parenchyma and accumulate in the ischemic
core (Brait et al., 2012). The number of inﬁltrating T lymphocytes in ischemic brain tissue was shown to increase over 24 h
after stroke onset and reach its peak in the delayed phase
(around day 3) in other studies (Schroeter et al., 1994; Jander
et al., 1995). In this study, we used a mouse MCAO model to
examine the frequency of several T cell subsets including
Th1, Th2 and Th17 in the ischemic brain, and found that
the elevation of Th1 and Th17 inﬁltration in the ischemic
core could be observed within 6 h up to day 3 following
MCAO. Thus, focal cerebral ischemia may stimulate rapid

89

and long-term Th1 and Th17 immune responses, and the
Th1/Th2 balance was also altered.
Recently, it has been reported that IL-33 can protect against atherosclerosis and diabetes which are well-known risk
factors for ischemic stroke (Miller et al., 2008; Rui et al., 2012).
Moreover, many studies have shown that IL-33 could support
Th2 cells to mediate Th1/Th2 polarization, which also could
regulate Th17 immune responses (Miller et al., 2008; Xu et al.,
2008; Duan et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2012). These intriguing
observations warrant further investigation. First, the level of
IL-33 expression in the CNS after stroke was less clear. In our
model, the protein and mRNA level of IL-33 were signiﬁcantly
decreased at 6 h and 72 h after MCAO, suggesting that IL-33
signaling was down-regulated following transient cerebral
ischemia. Prior work highlights that the imbalance between
Th1 and Th2 polarization may critically contribute to stroke
(Arumugam et al., 2005). Herein, we speculated that IL-33
signaling may be an important player in the status of Th1/
Th2 balance after ischemic stroke. To our surprise, there was
a recovery in the level of IL-33 expression at 24 h after MCAO.
Previous research has suggested that IL-33 levels are elevated
under the conditions of hypoxic and vascular damage such as
experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (Onda et al., 1999).
The recovery of IL-33 expression may be related to the
hypoxic stress after transient cerebral ischemia, then with
the massive neuronal necrosis or apoptosis, the expression of
IL-33 was still reduced. The underlying mechanisms need to
be further elucidated.
A recent study has demonstrated that the reduction of IL-33
expression in the CNS was associated with a protective outcome for human Alzheimer’s disease (Chapuis et al., 2009). To
further identify whether IL-33 is an important player for stroke outcome, we administered exogenous recombinant mouse
IL-33 intracerebroventricularly and found that IL-33 treatment
may attenuate brain injury severity at 24 h and 72 h after
MCAO. Meanwhile, IL-33 treatment also induced the enhanced
Th2 immune response and suppressed Th1 and Th17 immune
responses at 24 h and 72 h after MCAO. Hence, the protective
effect of IL-33 on MCAO may be related to the following
pathways: (a) similar to the role during atherosclerosis (Miller
et al., 2008), IL-33 induces a Th1-to-Th2 switch of immune
responses; (b) IL-33 acts as a chemo-attractant for Th2 cells
(Komai-Koma et al., 2007), and Th2 cells were attracted to the
ischemic core and played the anti-inﬂammatory role; (c) TGF-β,
in conjunction with IL-6, has been reported to be involved in
Th17 cell development (Qin et al., 2009; Malhotra et al., 2010).
The previous study has shown that TGF-β may limit IL-33
production in the inﬂammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (Rani
et al., 2011). Conversely, IL-33 may regulate gene transcription
of TGF-β or IL-6 as a nuclear factor to inﬂuence Th17 immune response. IL-33 may induce and attract Th2 cells to the
ischemic core to produce Th2 type cytokines such as IL-4,
which is a major negative regulator of proinﬂammatory cytokine production by T lymphocytes (Xiong et al., 2011). On the
other hand, IL-33 may also inhibit the proinﬂammatory effect
of Th1 and Th17 cells, and the production of proinﬂammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-17 was decreased. Thereby,
IL-33 could control neuroinﬂammation contributing to the reduction of ischemic brain damage. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear and merit further investigation.

po0.05 compared with the corresponding IL-33-treated and PBS-treated sham subgroup.

We also showed here that no protective effect of IL-33 could
be observed at 6 h after MCAO, and IL-33 did not inﬂuence the
change of T cell subsets in ischemic brain and the related
cytokines in the serum. The current point supports that at the
hyperacute phase of brain ischemia, DAMPs such as high
mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is released and triggers postischemic inﬂammation (Kim et al., 2006; Shichita et al., 2012).
Following this, immune cells begin to inﬁltrate and T lymphocytes regulate inﬂammation in the delayed phase (Yilmaz
et al., 2006). Thus, IL-33 has not yet played a role via regulating
T cell subsets at the onset of MCAO.
In summary, the present study demonstrates a novel role
for IL-33 in the modulation of Th1/Th2 balance and Th17
response after MCAO, and suggests that IL-33 administered
may contribute to the improvement of ischemic stroke outcome through promoting Th2 immune response and inhibiting Th1 and Th17 immune responses. Thus by extension, this
study provides a novel way to improve the prognosis and
treatment of ischemic stroke.

Experimental procedure

4.1.

Experimental animals

animal procedures were approved by the Huazhong University of
Science and Technology Animal Care and Use Committee.

4.2.

The animals were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate
(0.3 mL/100 g) and subjected to either middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) or sham operation. The reversible ischemia
procedure (occlusion–reperfusion) was previously described
(Zhang et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, the right carotid region was
exposed and a 0.16 mm diameter nylon ﬁlament (tip diameter
0.20; Sunbio Biotech, Beijing, China) was inserted through the
external carotid artery stump and gently advanced 10 mm to
occlude the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). After
30 min, blood ﬂow was restored by withdrawal of the ﬁlament. Sham control animals were subjected to similar operations without MCA occlusion. The body temperature was
maintained at 3770.5 1C during surgery with a heating lamp.
The mice in the MCAO group and the sham-operated group
were assigned to three subgroups according to the time of
sacriﬁce (6 h, 24 h and 72 h after surgery).

4.3.

Adult male C57BL/6 mice (n¼162; weighing 22 to 26 g; eight to ten
weeks of age), purchased from Wuhan University Center for
Animal Experiment (Wuhan, China), were housed in a room with
a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 AM) with access to food
and water ad libitum throughout the experimental period. All

Animal model of focal cerebral ischemia

Neurological assessment

Neurological deﬁcits of the experimental animals after MCAO
were graded on a scale of 0 to 5 (Tu et al., 2010). The criteria were
as follows: grade 0, no observable neurological deﬁcits; grade 1,
failed to extend left forepaw; grade 2, circled to the left; grade 3,
fell to the left; grade 4, could not walk spontaneously; and grade 5,
dead. Mice grading 1–3 indicated successful model establishment.

4.4.

Infarct volume measurement

At 6 h, 24 h or 72 h after surgery, the brains were removed
rapidly, frozen at  20 1C for 15 min and sectioned into four
slices. Then coronal slices were stained with 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Biosharp, USA) at 37 1C for
20 min followed by immersion in 10% formaldehyde. The
infarct volume was calculated as previously described using
the formulae (Lin et al., 1993):
Infarct volume (%)¼ [(volume of the normal hemisphere non-infarct volume of the infarct hemisphere)/volume
of the normal hemisphere]  100%

4.5.

Measurement of brain edema

At the desired time point on 6 h, 24 h and 72 h after surgery
with recombinant mouse IL-33 or PBS treatment, brains were
removed and immediately weighted for the wet weight (wW),
then dried at 100 1C for 24 h to obtain the dry weight (dW).
The percentage of water in the brain tissue was calculated
according to the following formulae:
Water content (%)¼(wW dW)/wW  100%

4.6.

RNA isolation and semiquantitative RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from brain tissues using TRIzol
Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 6 h, 24 h or 72 h after
surgery, and 5 μg of total RNA from each sample was reversetranscribed into the ﬁrst strand cDNA using PrimeScriptTM
RT reagent kit (Takara, Japan). Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was carried out using DreamTaq PCR Master Mix
(Fermentas, USA) and 250 nM of each speciﬁc primer for IL-33
(F: AACAGGCCTTCTTCGTCCTT; R: GAACGCACAGGCGTTTTACT, 187 bp), and GAPDH (F: TGATGACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG; R: TCCTTGGA GGCCATGTAGGCCAT, 240 bp) in a total
volume of 25 μL. Each PCR ampliﬁcation was performed using
the following parameters: 94 1C for 4 min, 35 cycles at 94 1C
for 1 min, 55 1C for 40 s, and 72 1C for 40 s, and a ﬁnal
elongation step at 72 1C for 10 min. IL-33 gene expression
was normalized with GAPDH mRNA content.

4.7.

Western blotting

The ipsilateral hemisphere was harvested at 6 h, 24 h or 72 h after
cerebral ischemia, homogenized in cold lysis buffer (10 M Tris–
HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol,
0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.5% deoxycholate, pH7.4) and 1 mM
PMSF. Protein concentrations were determined using bichinoninic acid (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Equal amounts (40 μg) of protein
were electrophoresed onto a 12% SDS/polyacrylamide gels (SDS/
PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes,
then blocked for 2 h at room temperature in TBS containing 0.1%
Tween-20 and 5% (W/V) notfat dry milk. The membranes were
incubated overnight at 4 1C with the primary antibody mouse IL33 (1:1000, MD Biosciences), washed 3 times with 0.1% Tween-20
in TBS, then incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody (1:8000, Vector, USA) for 45 min. The blots
were visualized using West Pico chemiluminescence reagent Kit
(Pierce, USA) and quantiﬁed with densitometry. β-actin (1:500,
Santa Cruz) was used as a loading control.

4.8.
IL-33

Expression and puriﬁcation of recombinant mouse

The cDNA fragment coding for mature IL-33 protein was
ampliﬁed from mouse brain cDNA using speciﬁc primer pairs:
50 -AAACGGATCCAGCATCCAAGGAACT TCACTT-30 and 50 CCGCTCGAGCATTAGATTTTCGAGAGCTTAAAC-30 . Then the
cDNA sequence was cloned into expression vector pGEX-6P1 and fused with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag before
transformed into Escherichia coli (BL21 strain). Recombinant
mouse IL-33 protein was induced by isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) and puriﬁed by glutathione afﬁnity chromatography (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China), followed by
polymyxin B column (Genscript, USA) to remove endotoxin.
The purity of IL-33 was more than 95% and the endotoxin
levels were less than 0.1 unit/μg of protein.

IL-33 treatment with intracerebroventricular injection

Recombinant mouse IL-33 was dissolved in 0.01 M PBS
(pH 7.4). The mice were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate
(0.3 mL/100 g) and mounted with their heads in a standard
stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting, USA). A stainless-steel microinjector was stereotaxicallly implanted into right lateral

brain research 1597 (2015) 86–94

ventricle of each mouse at the following stereotaxic coordinates (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001): 0.22 mm posterior to
bregma, 1 mm right from mid-sagittal line and 2.2 mm below
bregma. 5 μL PBS or recombinant mouse IL-33 solution (0.4 mg/
mL for a total dose of 2 μg) was injected (over 10 min) once
30 min before MCAO or sham operation. The mice were then
maintained under a heating lamp after surgery until recovery.

Flow cytometry assay (FACS)

The mononuclear cells from brain tissues were isolated using
Percoll gradients (GE Phamacia, USA) (Pino and Cardona,
2011). To examine the leukocyte phenotype in the brain, the
cells were stained with the following anti-mouse antibodies
(eBioscience): anti-CD3e-PE (clone 145-2C11), anti-CD3e-PECy7, anti-CD4-FITC (clone GK 1.5), anti-IL-17A-PE (clone
eBio17B7), anti-IFN-γ-PE-Cy7 (clone XMG 1.2) and anti-IL-4PE-Cy7 (clone BVD6-24G2). For intracellular staining, cells
were stimulated for 4–6 h with 1 μg/mL ionomycin (Sigma)
and 50 ng/mL phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, Sigma) in the
presence of Brefeldin A (Golgistop, eBioscience). After staining with antibodies against surface markers, cells were
permeabilized with Fix/Perm buffer (eBioscience) and ﬁnally
incubated with antibodies against intracellular cytokines.
Cells were analyzed on a FACS LSRII system (BD Biosciences).

4.11.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Blood samples were collected from IL-33 or PBS-treated MCAO
mice at 6 h, 24 h or 72 h after surgery and centrifuged at 1400g
for 10 min to separate the serum. Serum samples were frozen
at  80 1C immediately until analysis of cytokine protein concentrations with commercial kits for IL-17, IFN-γ and IL-4
(eBioscience, SanDiego, CA). The assays were performed in
duplicate according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

4.12.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 13.0 software
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Data were expressed as
mean7SEM. Comparison between two groups was statistically evaluated using the Student’s t-test. Multiple group
comparisons were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA Student–
Newman–Keuls test. Signiﬁcant differences were accepted
when probability values were o0.05.
