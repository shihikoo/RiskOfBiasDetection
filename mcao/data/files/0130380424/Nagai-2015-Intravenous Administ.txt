Abstract: It was reported that cilostazol (CLZ) suppressed disruption of the microvasculature
in ischemic areas. In this study, we have designed novel injection formulations containing
CLZ nanoparticles using 0.5% methylcellulose, 0.2% docusate sodium salt, and mill methods
(CLZnano dispersion; particle size 81 ˘ 59 nm, mean ˘ S.D.), and investigated their toxicity and
usefulness in a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury model (MCAO/reperfusion mice).
The pharmacokinetics of injections of CLZnano dispersions is similar to that of CLZ solutions
prepared with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, and no changes in the rate of hemolysis of rabbit
red blood cells, a model of cell injury, were observed with CLZnano dispersions. In addition, the
intravenous injection of 0.6 mg/kg CLZnano dispersions does not affect the blood pressure and
blood flow, and the 0.6 mg/kg CLZnano dispersions ameliorate neurological deficits and ischemic
stroke in MCAO/reperfusion mice. It is possible that the CLZnano dispersions will provide effective
therapy for ischemic stroke patients, and that injection preparations of lipophilic drugs containing
drug nanoparticles expand their therapeutic usage.

1. Introduction
Strokes lead to a high level of disability and are a leading cause of death worldwide. The number
of patients suffering ischemic strokes resulting from nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, the major cause of
ischemic stroke, is predicted to double by 2030 [1]. Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury lead
to damage of brain tissues, inflammation as a result of the disruption of the blood–brain barrier
(BBB), oxidative damage [2], and apoptosis [3]. Overall, excitotoxicity, inflammation and oxidative
stress play crucial roles in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke [4,5]. In acute ischemic stroke, the
re-establishment of cerebral blood flow was caused by the treatment of tissue plasminogen activator
(t-PA) within 4.5 h after the symptom onset, and the intravenous administration with recombinant
t-PA (rt-PA) within a few hours after the onset of ischemic attack has also been demonstrated by the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and the Stroke rt-PA Stroke Study Group [6]. Although,
the t-PA is very useful in therapy for ischemic stroke patients, it is known that the t-PA causes the
tPA-induced cell damage in human brain microvascular endothelial cells [7]. Therefore, further study
of the development of new therapies for ischemic stroke patients is important.

Cilostazol (CLZ, 6-[4-(1-cyclohexyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)butoxy]-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril) is an inhibitor
of phosphodiesterase-III, which increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) levels
by restraining platelet aggregation [8]. It is widely used for the secondary prevention of cerebral
infarction and treatment for intermittent claudication in peripheral artery disease. In addition to
its anti-platelet effect, the CLZ shows the inhibition of apoptosis and endothelial protection in
endothelial cells [9] prevented the phenotypic modulation in vascular smooth muscle cells [10],
and sustains cerebral blood flow (CBF) by endothelium-independent vasodilation [11]. Further,
it has been reported that CLZ protects the tPA-induced cell damage in human brain microvascular
endothelial cells [7], and the CLZ can attenuate ischemic brain injury by maintaining endothelial
function in the cerebral cortex [12]. Kasahara et al. [13] also reported that treatment with CLZ
suppresses the disruption of the microvasculature in ischemic areas, and Hara et al. showed that
CLZ reduces hemorrhagic transformations after cerebral ischemia by preventing BBB disruption in
mice [14]. These findings suggest that the administration of CLZ may effectively attenuate the brain
damage by the treatment immediately after the symptom onset of ischemic stroke. Therefore, the
development of drug delivery systems (DDS) for the intravenous administration of CLZ is desirable.
It is expected that drug systems using nanoparticles will improve the problem of poor water
solubility in injectable preparations of lipophilic drugs. Nano-sized particles such as liposomes [15],
polymer micelles [16], emulsions [17] and poly (lactic-coglycolic acid) (PLGA) nanospheres [18,19]
have been widely used in DDS, and the DDS enhanced drug absorption and reduced side-effects.
Furthermore, PLGA nanospheres can be applied to intravenous drug delivery systems [20]. On the
other hand, we have also developed methods to prepare drug nanoparticles by a bead mill
method [21,22]. Here, we have designed novel injection formulations containing CLZ nanoparticles,
and investigated their safety (toxicity) by measuring hemolysis, blood pressure and blood flow. In
addition, we demonstrate the protective effect of the intravenous injection of dispersions containing
CLZ nanoparticles in ischemic stroke using a cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced injury model
(MCAO/reperfusion mice).
2. Results
2.1. Evaluation of Particles Size and Stability of Dispersions Containing CLZ Nanoparticles
Figure 1 shows the particle size distribution of dispersions containing CLZ as described in
Table 1. The mean particle size using untreated CLZ (CLZmicro ) was 24.7 ˘ 14.3 µm (mean ˘ S.D.),
and reached a gel-like state when subjected to the mill method. On the other hand, CLZ particles
(Milled-CLZMC ) obtained by adding methylcellulose (MC) and using the mill method had a mean
particle size of 83 ˘ 62 nm (means ˘ S.D.). The mean particle size for CLZ subjected to the mill method
in the presence of both MC and docusate sodium salt (DS) was 81 ˘ 59 nm (CLZnano , mean ˘ S.D.);
the addition of DS alone did not affect the mean particle size.

for ischemic stroke. These results show that the CLZ solutions containing dimethyl sulfoxide and
cyclodextrin are not suitable for injection preparations. On the other hand, no RBC hemolysis was
observed for 0.5% dispersions containing CLZ nanoparticles. The CLZnano dispersion consists of safe
additives (do not use the DMSO and cyclodextrin), and the concentration of additives is lower. These
safe formulations may be related to the non-hemolysis of CLZnano dispersion. Therefore, care should
be taken concerning the methods and additives used to prepare nanoparticles in order to find suitable
formulations in terms of safety and stability.
In this study, we investigated the toxicity of dispersions containing CLZ nanoparticles by
measuring the plasma CLZ concentration, blood pressure and blood flow in rats to confirm the
safety of the injection preparations. The particle size influences its fate in the body, and it has been
reported that the particles of ě2 µm were trapped inside liver cells, and the particles of ě300–400 nm
were captured by macrophages and excreted. In addition, the particles of ě200 nm were filtered
out in the spleen, and the particles of ě100 nm were passed through the blood vessels via the
endothelial lining. Thus, the particle size affects functionality, residence in circulation, adherence,
degradation, and clearance [26–29]. The pharmacokinetic parameters for the intravenous injection
of dispersions containing CLZ nanoparticles are similar to those of the CLZ solution (Figure 3 and
Table 3). Although intravenous injections of CLZ dispersions containing microparticles for one week
(once a day) cause the decrease in body weight or death, the intravenous injections of CLZ dispersions
containing nanoparticles for one week (once a day) had no effects on body weight or survival.
It is known that solubility is enhanced by the preparation of nanoparticles because nanoparticles
have a high surface area. In addition, the CLZ interferes with platelet aggregation via an inhibitor
of phosphodiesterase-III [8]. Taken together, it is suggested that CLZ nanoparticles in CLZnano
dispersions may dissolve immediately after injection. Moreover, the intravenous injection of CLZ
dispersions containing nanoparticles appears not to cause thrombus formation. On the other hand,
although the intravenous injection of 1.0 mg/kg CLZ dispersions containing nanoparticles decreases
blood pressure and blood flow, blood pressure and blood flow in rats treated with intravenous
injections of 0.1 or 0.6 mg/kg CLZ dispersions containing nanoparticles do not change. These results
show that while the injection of 1.0 mg/kg CLZ dispersions containing nanoparticles may cause
toxicity, the injection of 0.6 mg/kg CLZ dispersions containing nanoparticles is safe.
Many studies have indicated that CLZ treatment suppresses the disruption of the microvasculature
in ischemic areas [13], and that CLZ reduces hemorrhagic transformations after cerebral ischemia
by preventing BBB disruption in mice [14]. We also investigated the therapeutic effects of CLZ in
ischemic stroke in MCAO/reperfusion mice treated with novel CLZnano dispersions. The intravenous
administration of CLZnano dispersions ameliorates the neurological deficits following ischemic stroke
in MCAO/reperfusion mice, and the effects increase with the CLZ concentration. Moreover, CLZnano
dispersions attenuate hypovolemia caused by MCAO/reperfusion in the brain. In addition, the
protective effect of CLZ dispersions containing nanoparticles was significantly higher than that of
the commercially available CLZ OD tablet in the ischemic stroke of MCAO/reperfusion mice. These
results show that the intravenous administration of CLZnano dispersions may provide therapy for
ischemic stroke.
It is important to clarify the mechanisms by which CLZ enables a decrease in the neurological
deficits caused by ischemic stroke. It is known that CLZ inhibits platelet aggregation caused by a
variety of stimuli, including adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid, epinephrine, collagen,
thrombin, and high shear stress [30–32]. Because of its unique mechanisms of action, a wide
variety of pharmacological actions has been reported, including antithrombosis in feline cerebral
ischemia [12], increased cerebral blood flow [33], and vasodilation via an increased cyclic AMP
level [12]. Moreover, it has been reported that in rat brains subjected to MCAO followed by 24 h
reperfusion, the oral administration of aspirin (300 mg/kg) has little effect on the cerebral infarct
size, but that the size is significantly reduced by CLZ (30 mg/kg) [34]. In addition, it was reported
that the neuroprotective potential of CLZ is based on its anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic

29337

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16, 29329–29344

effects (mediated by the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals), the decreased formation of tumor
necrosis factor-α, the inhibition of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activity, and the induction of
metallothionein-1 and -2 in brain [35–37]. Therefore, the protective effects of CLZnano dispersions may
also be related to these unique mechanisms. On the other hand, the infarct volume indicates that all
untreated animals lost more than half of the entire hemisphere while the treated mice had very small
infarcts (the damage in infarct core was also improved). The damage of brain in MCAO/reperfusion
mice was enhanced by the reperfusion, and the mice in this study were treated for three days
after reperfusion. Therefore, the CLZ prevents the exacerbation of damage by reperfusion, and the
permanent damage in the infarct core is lower in this model. In addition, the permanent damage
in the infarct core may be not detected by the method using 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride
(condition: 1.5%, 15 min), since the damage is lower in this model. On the other hand, the location of
measurement and distance between slices (2 mm) of brain tissue may also be related to the apparent
disappearance of damage in the infarct core.
Further studies are needed to elucidate the usefulness and toxicity of the intravenous
administration of dispersions containing CLZ nanoparticles as therapy for ischemic stroke.
In addition, it is important to clarify the relationships between the timing of administration and
curative effect on ischemic stroke. Therefore, we are now investigating the changes in ischemic
stroke when the CLZnano dispersions are administered 6–24 h after MCAO/reperfusion. Hara et al.
reported that CLZ protects against subacute tPA-induced cerebral injury in mice that have undergone
hemorrhagic transformation, and inhibits tPA-induced cell damage in human brain microvascular
endothelial cells [7]. Therefore, we will also demonstrate the usefulness of CLZnano dispersions in
tPA-administered mice.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Animals and Materials
Male Wistar rats aged 7 weeks, ICR mice aged 5 weeks, and rabbits, 2.5–3.0 kg, were used,
and housed under conditions: 12 h/day fluorescent light (07:00–19:00), 25 ˝ C room temperature.
All animal studies were performed following the Kinki University Faculty of Pharmacy Committee
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Low-substituted methylcellulose (MC,
METOLOSE SM-4, average viscosity, 4 Pa¨ s at 20 ˝ C) was purchased from Nihon Shokuhin Kako Co.,
Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Conventional CLZ (solid, CLZ microparticles, 22.8 ˘ 14.1 µm, means ˘ S.D.) was
obtained from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokushima, Japan). Docusate sodium salt (DS) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan). All other chemicals used were of the highest
purity commercially available. In this study, experiments were performed blind for treatment group.
4.2. Preparation of Dispersions Containing CLZ Nanoparticles
CLZ nanoparticles were prepared using zirconia balls, Pulverisette 7 (a planetary ball mill,
Fritsch Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and Bead Smash 12 (a bead mill, Wakenyaku Co., Ltd, Kyoto,
Japan). Zirconia balls (diameter: 10 mm) were added to a zirconia cup (diameter: 45 mm) containing
CLZ microparticles, and the mixture was crushed with the Pulverisette 7 for 24 h (400 rpm, room
temperature). The mixtures were then dispersed in sterilized isotonic saline containing MC or DS,
and crushed again with the Bead Smash 12 (5500 rpm, 30 s ˆ 15 times, 4 ˝ C) in the presence of
zirconia beads (diameter: 0.1 mm). These preparations were done under aseptic conditions, and the
formulations of the CLZ dispersions are presented in Table 1. The pH of dispersions containing CLZ
micro- or nanoparticles was 6.7. The particle sizes and images were obtained using a nanoparticle
size analyzer SALD-7100 (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan; refractive index 1.60-0.10i) and scanning
probe microscope SPM-9700 (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan), respectively. The image of dispersions
containing CLZ nanoparticles (CLZnano ) as described in Table 1 was created by combining a phase
and height image using image analysis software connected to the SPM-9700. CLZ solubility in saline

29338

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16, 29329–29344

containing 0.5% MC and 0.2% DS was not detected by the high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) method (solubility was detected using a 0.22 µm membrane filter). In this study, we used the
solution containing CLZ (CLZ solution) as a control. A 0.008% CLZ solution was prepared in 0.6%
2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as described in our previous our report [38]. In this preparation,
the solvent containing the additives was filtered through a Minisart CE (pore size 0.20 µm, Costar,
Cambridge, MA, USA).
4.3. Stability of Dispersions Containing CLZ
CLZ (3 mL) dispersions as shown in Table 1 were incubated in test tubes (5 mL) in dark condition
(20 ˝ C for 14 days), after which sample solutions (50 µL) were taken from 5 mm under the surface
(the liquid surface height is 4 cm). The CLZ concentrations in the samples were determined by the
following HPLC method. Fifty microliters of sample was added to 50 µL methanol containing 0.25 µg
indomethacin (internal standard), and the mixture was filtered through a Chromatodisk 4A (pore
size 0.45 µm, Kurabo Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The solution (10 µL) was used, and measured
by using a Shimadzu LC-20AT system (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an Inertsilr
ODS-3 (3 µm, column size: 2.1 mm ˆ 50 mm) column (GL Science Co., Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The mobile
phase consisted of acetonitrile/methanol/water (35/15/50, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min; the
column temperature was 35 ˝ C, and the wavelength for detection was 254 nm.
4.4. Hemolysis of Rabbit Red Blood Cells (RBC) by Treatment with Dispersions Containing
CLZ Nanoparticles
Blood was collected from the marginal ear vein of adult Japanese albino rabbits weighing
2.5–3.0 kg, and 1 mL blood was mixed with 100 mL heparin (10 mg/mL). The mixture was centrifuged
at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 37 ˝ C, and the pellets were washed with phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4).
The resulting pellets were used as red blood cells (RBC) in this study. Forty µL RBC was incubated
with dispersions containing CLZ nanoparticles for 30 min. After incubation, the RBC solutions were
centrifuged at 2300 rpm for 5 min at 37 ˝ C, and absorbance (Abs) at 576 nm was measured. The rate
of hemolysis was calculated according to Equation (1):
Rate of hemolysis p%q “ Abstreatment {Absnon´treatment ˆ 100

(1)

4.5. Induction of Focal Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion
Focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
completed following the methods of Hara et al. [39]. The mice were anesthetized by isoflurane (2.5%)
using BS-400T (Brain Science Idea Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and the body temperature was regulated
at 37 ˝ C. MCAO was induced by insertion of a silicone-coated 8-0 nylon monofilament (Natsume
Seisakusyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) into the left middle cerebral artery. Two hour after this procedure,
the mice were briefly reanesthetized with isoflurane, and the middle cerebral artery blood flow was
restored by withdrawing the nylon monofilament. Sham-control mice underwent the same surgical
procedure but without middle cerebral artery obstruction. At 3 h after reperfusion, a dose of 0.1, 0.6
or 1.0 mg/kg of CLZnano was injected into the tail vein using a 1 mL syringe and a 27-gauge needle.
The injection volume was set at 5 mL/kg body weight. The vehicle-treated mice were injected with
the same volume of saline containing 0.5% MC and 0.2% DS. Three days after reperfusion, the brain
was removed and three slices were cut out for analysis: from the bregma (2 mm, AreaA ), 1 mm
anterior to the bregma (2 mm, AreaB ), and 1 mm posterior to the bregma (2 mm, AreaC ), using Brain
Matrices (Brain ScienceIdea Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). The slices of brain tissue were dyed with 1.5%
2,3.5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) for 15 min, and monitored under a digital camera. The

29339

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16, 29329–29344

images obtained were analyzed with Image J, and the infarct area was calculated (mm2 ). The infarct
volume (mm3 ) was estimated according to the following equation (Equation (2))
Infarct volume pmm3 q “ AreaA ˆ 2 ` AreaB ˆ 2 ` AreaC ˆ 2

(2)

4.6. Neurological Deficits
Mice were tested for neurological deficits 72 h after middle cerebral arterial occlusion followed
by reperfusion (MCAO/reperfusion). Scoring was based on the method of Hara et al. [39]. The scale is
as follows: 0, no observable neurological deficits (normal); 1, closing of the left eye; 2, failure to extend
the right foreleg; 3, walking to the contralateral side; 4, loss of righting reflex or moving. The each
mouse belonged was masked for the investigator.
4.7. Assay of Plasma CLZ Concentrations
On the day before the administration of CLZ solution or dispersions, the rats was anesthetized
by isoflurane (2.5%), and a silicone tubing (I.D. 0.5 mm, O.D. 1.0 mm) was cannulated into the right
jugular vein. The next day, 0.3 mL of CLZ solution or dispersions (0.1 mg/kg) was injected into the
femoral vein, and venous blood (200 µL) was collected through the cannula at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30,
45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the single injection of CLZ. The blood was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for
20 min at 4 ˝ C, and the plasma obtained was stored at ´80 ˝ C until CLZ analysis by the HPLC method
described above. The CLZ concentration was analyzed according to Equation (3):
CCLZ “ A ¨ e´α¨t ` B ¨ e´β¨t

(3)

where t is time (0–120 min) after CLZ injection, and CCLZ is the concentration of CLZ at the
corresponding time. α and β show the elimination rate constants in the first and second-phases, and
A and B are the CLZ concentrations in the α- and β-phases, respectively. A nonlinear least-squares
computer program (MULTI) was employed for the calculation.
The area under the CLZ concentration-time curve (AUCCLZ ), area under the first moment curve
(AUMCCLZ ) and mean residence time (MRTCLZ ) were estimated by using Equations (4)–(6).

Briefly, AUCCLZ was determined according to the trapezoidal rule.
4.8. CLZ Concentration in Brain
Focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion was induced by MCAO on the left side as described above.
Three days after reperfusion, the brain was removed, and slices 1 mm anterior and 1 mm posterior to
the center of the bregma were cut using Brain Matrices (Brain Science Idea Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan).
The sliced brain tissue was divided at the center, and the right and left parts were homogenized
separately in methanol. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 ˝ C, and the
resultant supernatants were used for the measurement of CLZ concentration. The CLZ concentration
was analyzed by the HPLC method described above.

4.9. Measurement of Blood Pressure
Blood pressure was measured according to previously published methods [40]. Briefly, rats were
anesthetized with Urethane (1.2 g/kg, i.p.) and restrained on a board in a supine position. Blood
pressure was measured for 140 min (11:00–13:20). A polyethylene cannula tube (PE50, Clay Adams,
Division of Becton Dickinson and Company, Parsippany, NJ, USA) was cannulated into the left side
of common carotid artery, and a pressure transducer (DX312, Nihon Kohden, Shinjuku, Tokyo) was
connected in the other end of the polyethylene cannula tubeto measure the blood pressure. To prevent
blood coagulation in the cannula, 7.7 µg/mL heparin solution was injected at a speed of 0.38 mL/h.
The board was kept warm at about 37 ˝ C to maintain the rat body temperature.
4.10. Measurement of Blood Flow in Carotid Artery and Brain
Rats were anesthetized with Urethane (1.2 g/kg, i.p.), and blood flow in carotid artery and brain
was measured by non-contact type laser doppler flowmetry (OMEGA Flow FLO-N1, OMEGAWAVE
INC., Tokyo, Japan). For the measurement of blood flow in the carotid artery, a non-contact type probe
(GJ probe) connected to the laser doppler flowmetry (FLO-N1) was set on the left carotid artery, and
measurements were collected for 140 min. For the measurement of blood flow in brain tissue, a hole
1 mm in diameter was made using an engraving drill into the area 1.0 mm caudal and 3.5 mm to the
left aspect from the bregma. A connect probe non-contact type connect probe (GJ probe) was passed
through the hole (depth, 1.4 mm), and blood flow in the brain tissue was measured for 30 min. The
board was kept warm at about 37 ˝ C to maintain the rat body temperature.
4.11. Statistical Analysis
All values are presented as mean ˘ standard deviation (S.D.) or standard error of the mean
(S.E.). Unpaired Student’s t-test was used to evaluate statistical differences, and multiple groups were
evaluated by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison. p values less
than 0.05 were considered significant.
5. Conclusions
In the present study, we attempted to prepare novel drug nanoparticles for use in preparing a
CLZ formulation for intravenous administration without the use of a toxic solvent, such as dimethyl
sulfoxide, and succeeded in preparing a high quality dispersion containing CLZ nanoparticles
(particle size, 81 ˘ 59 nm, means ˘ S.D.). The dispersion containing CLZ nanoparticles ameliorates
neurological deficits due to ischemic stroke in MCAO/reperfusion mice. In addition, at concentrations
of 0.1–0.6 mg/kg, the intravenous administration of the dispersions containing CLZ nanoparticles
does not affect blood pressure or flow under normal conditions, and the plasma pharmacokinetics is
similar to that of the CLZ solution. It is possible that dispersions containing CLZ nanoparticles will
provide effective therapy for ischemic stroke patients, and that injection preparations of lipophilic
drugs using drug nanoparticles expand their usage for therapy. This study provides important
information to develop further studies aimed at developing therapies for ischemic stroke patients,
and to develop less toxic injection preparations.
