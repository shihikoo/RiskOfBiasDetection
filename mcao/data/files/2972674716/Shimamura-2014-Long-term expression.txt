Periostin is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein and has various cellular effects. Previously, we demonstrated the
neuroprotective effects of periostin during the acute stage of cerebral ischemia. However, its expression during the chronic
stage remains unknown. Herein, we examined the expression of full-length periostin (periostin 1; Pn1) and its splicing variant
lacking exon 17 (periostin 2; Pn2) during the 28 days following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Real-time
reverse transcription-PCR showed that the expression of Pn2 was dramatically upregulated between days 3 and 28, and the
highest expression was observed on day 7. The expression of Pn1 was also increased, but delayed compared with Pn2.
Immunohistochemistry showed that periostin was weakly expressed in reactive astrocytes in the peri-infarct region and in
microglia/macrophages in infarct regions, on days 3 and 7. Periostin was also expressed around CD31-positive cells in both
the peri-infarct and the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) on days 3 and 7. SOX-2 positive cells, which are neural stem cells, also
expressed periostin on day 7. The highest periostin immunoreactivity that occurred co-localized with collagen I and fibronectin
in the peri-infarct region between days 7 and 28. Thus, the expression pattern of periostin mRNA was dependent on the
splicing variant, and it continued to be expressed up to 28 days after cerebral ischemia. As periostin was expressed in various
cells, such as reactive astrocytes/microglia, fibroblasts and neuronal progenitor cells, periostin might be associated with
pathophysiology in post-ischemic inflammation and neurogenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Periostin is a 93-kDa secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) N-glycoprotein and has variable sequences in the C-terminal region. In
humans, exons 17, 18, 19 and 21 are alternatively spliced, whereas
exons 17, 20 and 21 are alternatively spliced in mice.1 Recently,
periostin was reported to be a critical marker of progression/reversal
of hypertensive nephropathy2 and another study showed that
angiotensin II increased periostin expression in a rat model of
continuous angiotensin II infusion and in cultured adult rat cardiac
fibroblasts.3 Ischemic stroke is also one of major complications in
hypertension4 and we previously showed the expression in reactive
astrocytes and periendothelium in the acute phase of ischemic stroke,
where periostin 2 (Pn2, splicing variant lacking exon 17) but not
periostin 1 (Pn1, full-length periostin) worked as neuroprotective.5
However, the expression of periostin has not been clarified in the
chronic stage of ischemic stroke.
Recent studies showed that periostin has important roles in (1) the
migration and proliferation of fibroblasts,6 which express ECM

molecules such as laminin and fibronectins,7 (2) the expression of
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in macrophages,8 and (3) T
regulatory cell differentiation induced by transforming growth factor
(TGF)-b1.9 From the viewpoint, we hypothesized that periostin would
be expressed in the chronic stage of ischemic stroke, as the fibroblasts
invading the lesion site with secreting ECMs10 and T regulatory cells11
as well as MMPs12 in the chronic phase have been reported to have
important roles in the recovery of injured brain. In addition, periostin
was reported to be dependent on the integrin-Akt pathway13 in cell
proliferation and the integrin-FAK pathway in cell migration.14
Because integrin receptors are involved in migration15,16 and
proliferation16 of neuronal progenitor cells in the SVZ, we also
hypothesized that periostin might be expressed in the SVZ.
To clarify these hypothesis, we examined the expression of periostin
mRNA and protein in mice during the 28 days after transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo). Although mice have several
alternative splice variants of the periostin gene in exons 17, 20 and
21, we focused on Pn1 (full-length periostin) and Pn2 (splicing

Pn1 and Pn2 are relatively well known from our previous study.5
METHODS
Surgical procedure
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Osaka University. Experiments were performed in 6- to 8-weekold male C57BL/6 mice (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan).

tMCAo
Mice were anesthetized with 1.4% isoflurane. Cerebral blood flow was
measured using a laser Doppler flowmeter (Unique Acquisition software;
Unique Medical, Tokyo, Japan). A 6.0 monofilament surgical suture was
advanced into the internal carotid artery to obstruct the origin of the medical
cerebral artery (MCA). The filament was left in place for 90 min and then
removed. Only animals that exhibited more than an 82% reduction in cerebral
blood flow (CBF) during MCA occlusion and in which CBF recovered by 50%
after 5 min of reperfusion were included in the study. Mouse rectal

temperature was kept at 37.0±0.5 1C during surgery and in the recovery
period, until the animals regained consciousness.

Primer pairs for real-time reverse transcription-PCR
The cerebral cortex was collected using a punch (FST No.18035-80). RNA from
the brain punch was extracted using the QIAGEN RNeasy Lipid TissueMini Kit
(Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each quantitative PCR analysis was performed using an ABI Prism 7700
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Applera Co., Norwalk, CT,
USA) with SYBR green staining of DNA double strands. The following primer
pairs were used: Pn1 (sense: 50 -ATAACCAAAGTCGTGGAACC-30 , antisense:
50 -TGTCTCCCTGAAGCAGTCTT-30 , 415 bp), Pn2 (sense: 50 -CCATGACTGTC
TATAGACCTG-30 , antisense: 50 -TGTCTCCCTGAAGCAGTCTT-30 , 360 bp),
mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (sense: 50 -GGGTGGAGCCA
AAAGGGTC-30 , anti-sense: 50 -GGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCA-30 , 534 bp).2
Each mRNA value was normalized to the expression of glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase.

Immunohistochemical staining
Mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and the brain was cut
into 12-mm thick sections. Sections were incubated in an anti-periostin
antibody (1:25; goat polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA,
#SC-49480). This antibody was previously used to examine the expression
of periostin in skin wounds.17 As a negative control, normal control IgG
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #SC-2028) was used instead of the anti-periostin
antibody. For double immunostaining, sections were fixed again and blocked.
The sections were incubated with anti-MAP2 (1:1000; mouse monoclonal;
Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)

(1:1000; mouse monoclonal; Sigma-Aldrich), Iba-1 (1:1000; rabbit polyclonal;
Wako, Tokyo, Japan), CD31 (1:100; rat monoclonal; Becton Dickinson, San
Jose, CA, USA), SOX-2 (1:500; rabbit polyclonal; Merck Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA), Fibronectin (1:200; rabbit polyclonal; Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA), collagen I (1:500; rabbit polyclonal; Novotec, Lyon, France) or antiaSMA antibody (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich).

Statistical analysis
All values are expressed as the mean±s.e.m. Multiple comparisons were
performed using an analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s Multiple
Comparison Test.

RESULTS
Expression of mRNA of Pn1 and Pn2 after tMCAo
Elevated expression of Pn2 mRNA was observed at an earlier time
point (Day 3) in the infarct regions compared with Pn1 mRNA
(Figure 1). The expression of Pn2 mRNA was already increased by day
3 and continued to increase until day 7. Pn2 expression level on days
14 and 28 was lower than that on day 7, but still at a high level. By
contrast, Pn1 mRNA was increased on day 7 in the infarct regions and
gradually decreased between days 14 and 28.
Immunohistochemical analysis of expression of Pn protein after
tMCAo
We previously showed that periostin was expressed in neurons in the
normal brain and in reactive astrocytes around endothelial cells in the
peri-infarct region, 24 h after ischemia. In this study, on day 3,

periostin protein could be detected in Iba-1-positive microglia
(Figure 2a) and around CD31-positive cells (Figure 2b) in the periinfarct and infarct regions and in GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes in
the peri-infarct regions (Figure 2c). Notably, scattered expression of
periostin was also observed in the SVZ in the ischemic hemisphere
(Figure 2d).
On day 7, periostin protein was still detected in astrocytes
(Supplementary Figures 1A–C), microglia and around CD31-positive
cells in the peri-infarct and infarct regions (Figures 3a and b).
Periostin was also expressed in SOX2-positive cells, which is a marker
for neural progenitor cells, in the SVZ (Figure 3c). Notably, much
higher expression was observed in fibronectin- (Figure 3d) and
collagen I-positive cells (Supplementary Figures 1D–F) in the
peri-infarct regions, but not in the infarct core. Periostin was also
co-localized with fibronectin (Supplementary Figures 1G–I) but not
with CD-31 or aSMA (data not shown) in pial arteries in ischemic
injured brain.
On days 14 and 28, periostin was strongly expressed in the periinfarct region, but was weakly expressed in the infarct core, where it
was co-localized with collagen I (Figures 4a and c) and fibronectin
(Figures 4b and d). The expression level in the peri-infarct and infarct
region was much higher than that in neurons in normal region
(Supplementary Figure 2). The expression of periostin protein was
observed in astrocytes on day 14, but not on day 28 (Supplementary
Figures 3A, C). Expression of periostin was also observed in microglia
in the infarct region (Supplementary Figures 3B, D), but not in the
SVZ (data not shown). The temporal and spatial profile of periostin

expression are summarized in Table 1. Thus, periostin was continued
to be expressed in various cells in the chronic stage of ischemic brain.
DISCUSSION
Our previous study demonstrated that Pn1 and Pn2 mRNA were
expressed in normal cortical tissue, and the expression level of Pn2
mRNA, but not Pn1, was increased in the infarct region 24 h after
tMCAo.5 Compared with the expression level of Pn2 mRNA/
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (8.6±3.3 in the infarct
regions and 0.29±0.05 in sham) at 24 h,5 the expression of Pn2
mRNA between days 3 and 28 was much higher. Considering that the

increased expression of Pn1 mRNA and the co-localization of periostin
with type I collagen and fibronectin were first observed starting on day 7,
Pn1 might be mainly produced in fibroblasts, and Pn2 might be
expressed in reactive astrocytes, microglia, fibroblasts and around the
endothelium, although further studies are necessary to develop antibodies
that allow the discrimination of the expression of Pn1 and Pn2.
Although the role of periostin was not fully clarified in the present
study, we speculate that periostin might have various roles in the
chronic stages of ischemic brain injury because of their expression in
various cells. One possibility is that periostin might promote the
protection and regeneration of the surviving neuronal network in the
peri-infarct regions, because Pn2 has exhibited neuroprotection and
neurite outgrowth in primary cultured adult neurons.5 Another
possibility is that secreted periostin might act on the activated
macrophages, because recent reports showed that periostin
enhanced adhesion of macrophages to hyaloid vessels18 and
increased the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and MMP-13 in bone
marrow-derived macrophages.8 Considering that MMPs in the
subacute stage of ischemia (24–72 h) have deleterious effects
following injury of the blood–brain barrier, edema and hemorrhage,19
secreted Pn2 from activated astrocytes and microglia/macrophages in
the subacute stage may be associated with the regulation of the
blood–brain barrier. In contrast, Pn1 and Pn2 expression during the
chronic stage may be related to recovery after stroke through
modulation of MMPs, because the delayed phase of MMPs (7–14
days) in the late stages of stroke has been shown to be required for
improving recovery and enhancing long-term functional outcomes.12
An important finding of the present study is the high expression of
periostin in fibroblasts during the chronic stage. There is a possibility
that some amount of periostin might be leaked from the serum with
fibronectin because of the breakdown of blood–brain barrier occurring. However, the majority of the periostin was likely produced in the
brain because the highest expression of periostin did not occur during
the time period when the blood–brain barrier damage is most severe,
which has been reported as 48 h after tMCAo.20 As fibronectin and
type I collagen are expressed in fibroblasts and periostin is strongly
expressed in cardiac fibroblasts21 and dermal fibroblasts,6 periostin
could have originated in fibroblasts in the brain during days 7–28.
Although the role of fibroblasts in the chronic stage has not been
elucidated in the ischemic brain, studies of traumatic brain injury
showed that fibroblasts began to invade the lesion site 3 days after
injury and proliferated with secretion of ECMs, such as type IV
collagen, fibronectin and laminin.10 Because the latter two ECMs have
been shown to enhance neurite outgrowth,22 periostin might work
with these ECMs to enhance neurite outgrowth. Considering that the
proliferation of fibroblasts10,23,24 and the production of ECMs
including periostin25 are enhanced by TGF-b1, TGF-b1 activated
after ischemic stroke might be one of cytokines to stimulate the
expression of periostin. The secreted periostin might act on fibroblasts
in an autocrine manner and might promote the migration and
proliferation of fibroblasts.6 Because periostin was also shown to be
involved in the augmentation of TGF-b-induced T regulatory cells
differentiation,9 periostin might be also involved with the protective
and adaptive immune response during the delayed stage.26
Interestingly, immunohistochemistry showed the expression of periostin on days 3 and 7, which coincides with the proliferation of neural
progenitors in the ischemic SVZ regions.27 Because previous studies
showed that integrin receptor b1,28 which have been suggested as the
receptors of periostin,13 were related to the migration and proliferation
of neural stem cells or neural progenitor cells,15,16 periostin might have
a role in endogenous neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia.
Hypertension Research

In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that periostin was
expressed in various cells throughout the subacute to chronic stages in
the ischemic brain. Because periostin has various roles in the
functions of neurons, fibroblasts and immune cells, periostin might
be one of the key molecules involved in regeneration and the postischemic immune system. In addition, the expression of periostin in
the SVZ suggests a role in neurogenesis. Further studies, including
examining other splice variants, are necessary to clarify the function
of periostin during the chronic stage of ischemic stroke.
