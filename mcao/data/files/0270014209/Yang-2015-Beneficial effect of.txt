Recent studies uncovered that glutamate accumulation following cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R)
was related to the dysfunction of miR-107/glutamate transporter-1(GLT-1) pathway and magnesium lithospermate B (MLB) possesses the pharmacological activity of anti-excitotoxicity. This study aims to
explore whether MLB is able to protect rat brain from excitatory neurotoxicity during I/R by modulating
miR-107/GLT-1 pathway. Rats were subjected to 2 h of cerebral ischemia following by 24 h of reperfusion
to establish an I/R injury model, which showed an increase in neurological deﬁcit score, infarct volume
and cellular apoptosis concomitant with glutamate accumulation, miR-107 elevation and GLT-1 downregulation. Administration of MLB reduced I/R-induced cerebral injury accompanied by a reverse in
glutamate accumulation, miR-107 and GLT-1 expression. Next, we examined the association of MLB with
miR-107/GLT-1 pathway in a nerve cell hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury model. H/R treatment increased the nerve cells apoptosis concomitant with glutamate accumulation and miR-107 elevation, and
suppressed GLT-1 expression, mimicking our in vivo ﬁndings. All these effects were reversed in the
presence of MLB, conﬁrming a strong correlation between MLB and miR-107/GLT-1 pathway. Based on
these observations, we conclude that MLB is able to protect the rat brain from excitatory neurotoxicity
during I/R through the regulation of miR-107/GLT-1 pathway.

1. Introduction
Accounting for about 80 percent of all strokes, ischemic stroke
is usually caused by a clot within an artery, resulting in deprivation
of enough oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood supply to a portion of
the brain (Wu and Grotta, 2013). Rapid restoration of blood supply
by means of thrombolysis or mechanical recanalization is the ﬁrst
and essential step to reduce death and disability from ischemic
stroke (Sugunan et al., 2013). Paradoxically, in many cases, reperfusion may exacerbate the brain injury initiated by ischemia, a
phenomenon referred to as the “ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) injury”
(Pan et al., 2007). Necrosis and apoptosis are the two major distinct types of brain cell death following I/R (Jung et al., 2010). The

excessive death of brain cells ultimately leads to neurological
dysfunction, such as partial or total loss of consciousness, and
sudden numbness or weakness of the arm, leg or face, on one side
of the body (Sallar et al., 2010).
Multiple pathophysiological processes, including oxidative
stress, inﬂammation and excitatory amino acids neurotoxicity, are
believed to be involved in cerebral I/R injury (Brouns and De Deyn,
2009; Eltzschig and Eckle, 2011). Among them, glutamate-induced
neuronal toxicity, the so-called excitatory neurotoxicity, is thought
as the triggering spark in the ischemic neuronal damage (Kostandy, 2012). Numerous studies have demonstrated that an accumulation of glutamate, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, plays a major role in excitatory neurotoxicity following I/R, suggesting that a reduction of glutamate
accumulation may have a potential value in prevention of cerebral
I/R injury (Camacho and Massieu, 2006; Koinig et al., 2001).
Magnesium lithospermate B (MLB) is a major component of the
aqueous extract from Danshen, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine (Wu and Wang, 2012; Zhou et al., 2005). MLB possesses

92

multiple pharmacological activities among which anti-oxidation
(Quan et al., 2013b), anti-inﬂammation (Quan et al., 2013a), and
anti-apoptosis (Quan et al., 2014) are believed to be responsible
for, at least partially, the neuroprotective effects against ischemic
stroke. To date, most of studies focused on the antioxidative activity of MLB (Kim et al., 2010). Actually, MLB was also able to
inhibit the excitotoxicity (Xiao et al., 2013). However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In a recent study, we
demonstrated that glutamate accumulation following I/R was due
to an upregulation of miR-107 in the brain, which in turn led to a
suppression of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), the most abundant subtype of GLT for glutamate clearance (Yang et al., 2014).
Based on published evidence as well as our recent ﬁndings, we
hypothesize that MLB inhibits excitotoxicity through regulation of
miR-107/GLT-1 pathway.
In the present study, using a rat model of focal cerebral I/R
injury, we investigated whether MLB was able to ameliorate glutamate-mediated excitatory injury by suppressing miR-107 expression in brain. To corroborate the ﬁndings in vivo study, we
established a nerve cell model of hypoxia–reoxygenation (H/R)
injury in vitro to mimic the condition of I/R injury in vivo. Our data
suggest that the neuroprotective effect of MLB against excitotoxicity is involved in the regulation of miR-107/GLT-1
pathway.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experiments in animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 230–280 g were provided
by the Laboratory Animal Center, Xiang-Ya School of Medicine,
Central South University, China. The rats were fasted for 24 h before the experiments, with free access to tap water. The study was
performed following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals, published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH
Publication, 8th edition, 2011), the ARRIVE guidelines (Animal
Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) and experiments were
approved by the Central South University Veterinary Medicine
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Animals were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) to establish a model of I/R injury as we described previously (Fu et al., 2014). Brieﬂy, the animals were anesthetized
with sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, i.p.). The right common
carotid artery (CCA) was exposed and clipped with artery clamp.
The external carotid artery (ECA) was isolated and ligatured. A
nylon suture with a blunted tip (0.40 mm diameter) was introduced through a tiny incision in ECA and then into internal
carotid artery (ICA). The middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded by nylon suture at the position of 18–20 mm distal from a
carotid bifurcation. The nylon suture was left there for 2 h and
then withdrawn for 24 h reperfusion. The rats were returned to
cages with free access to water and food after incision was closed.
Animals from the sham group underwent the same procedure
except that the nylon suture was inserted only 7 mm above the
carotid bifurcation.
To explore the effect of MLB on I/R injury, the rats were randomly allocated to 5 groups (n ¼16 per group): the control group,
without surgery; the sham group, underwent surgical procedures
but without ischemic insult; the I/R group, subjected to 2 h of
ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion; the MLB group, treated
with MLB (20 mg/kg, dissolved in 0.9% NaCl, i.v.; provided by
Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, China, with the purity Z99.4%) 30 min after the ischemia surgery; the vehicle group,
treated with equal volume of 0.9% NaCl (i.v.), 30 min after the
ischemia surgery. At the end of reperfusion, neurological deﬁcit

score was assessed ﬁrst, and then the plasma was collected for the
measurement of glutamate level. The brain tissues of 8 rats from
each group were saved for infarct volume measurement, whereas
the brain tissues (dissected from ischemic boundary area) of the
remaining 8 rats from each group were collected for terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay or other molecular studies (the expression of miRNA, mRNA or protein; activity of caspase-3). Four rats in total were
excluded from the study because 2 of them died before the
planned end point while 2 of them did not give rise to infarcts due
to surgical failure.
2.2. Assessment of neurological deﬁcit score and infarct volume
At the end of reperfusion, the functional consequences of focal
cerebral I/R injury were evaluated by an investigator blinded to the
experimental groups according to a ﬁve-point neurological deﬁcit
score (0 ¼ no deﬁcit, 1 ¼failed to extent the left forepaw,
2¼ decreased grip strength of left forepaw, 3 ¼circling to left by
pulling the tail, 4 ¼spontaneous circling) (Schabitz et al., 2004).
The infarct volume was evaluated by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. After neurological function assessment, the animals were killed under the condition of anesthesia. Brains were rapidly removed and were sliced into coronal
sections (2–3 mm thickness) with the aid of a brain matrix. Sections were incubated with 2% TTC for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by
immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, then scanned into a
computer and analyzed with the imaging software (Image J, NIH,
USA). The absence or presence of infarction was determined by
examining TTC stain. The infarct volume (in mm3) of each section
was equal to infarct area (in mm2) multiply by the section thickness (2–3 mm). The total infarct volume of each brain was then
calculated by summing up the infarct volumes of all sections. To
eliminate the effect of edema on the accuracy of infarct volume
assay, the ﬁnal infarct volume was corrected by following equation: corrected infarct volume ¼ total infarct volume  (left hemisphere volume/right hemisphere volume). Left hemisphere refers
to no-ischemic hemisphere of brain while right hemisphere refers
to ischemic contralateral side (see deﬁnition in Fig. 1C).
2.3. Experiments in cell cultures
NG108-15 neural cells (1  104 cells/cm2) were cultured in
DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin
(100 mg/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and L-glutamine (2 mM). The
cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed incubator with
95% air/5% CO2 for 2 days, and then washed with PBS and cultured
in serum free DMEM for 24 h before the experiments. To establish
the H/R injury model, NG108-15 cells were subjected to 5 h-hypoxia (O2/N2/CO2, 1:94:5) in the pre-conditioned hypoxic medium
followed by 20 h-reoxygenation, where the hypoxic medium was
replaced with the fresh medium upon switching to reoxygenation.
To explore the neuroprotecive effect of MLB and the potential
mechanisms, cell experiments were performed under the condition of H/R, which mimics the I/R in vivo. NG108-15 cells were
randomly divided into 5 groups (8 individual experiments per
group): the control group, without any treatment; the H/R group,
cells were subjected to 5 h of hypoxia followed by 20 h of reoxygenation; the MLB at low dose (L) or high dose (H) plus H/R
group, MLB (5 μM or 10 μM) was added to culture medium before
the cells were subjected to H/R; the vehicle plus H/R group, equal
volume of MLB vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was added to culture medium
before the cells were subjected to H/R. At the end of experiments,
culture mediums or cells were collected for measurement of glutamate level, cellular apoptosis, GLT-1 (mRNA and protein) expression or capase-3 activity.

2.4. Measurement of cellular apoptosis

2.5. Caspase-3 activity assay

Cellular apoptosis in the brain tissue was analyzed by TUNEL
assay. The procedure was carried out following the manufacturer's
instructions (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA). Lack of terminal transferase
in TUNEL reaction mixture served as a negative control. The brain
slides were observed under microscope at 200  magniﬁcation
and photographed by a high-resolution digital camera (Nikon
Eclipse 80i, Tokyo, Japan). Two distinct patterns of TUNEL staining
cells were identiﬁed. Some were slightly stained and considered to
be necrotic cells while others were densely stained and displayed
clear apoptotic characteristics. Only the latter were counted as
TUNEL positive cells. Twenty random high-power ﬁelds in the ischemic boundary area from each brain sample were selected and
blindly quantitated. The total number of positively stained cells
was counted and expressed as cell numbers per cm2 of brain
tissue.
Hoechst staining was applied to evaluate H/R-induced NG10815 cell apoptosis. The protocol for Hoechst staining was performed
according to the manufacturer's instruction (Beyotime, Shanghai,
China). Brieﬂy, the cells were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
15 min, washed with PBS, air dried, and incubated with 1 g/ml of
Hoechst 33258, a bisbenzimide cell-permeant dye showing bright
blue ﬂuorescence upon binding to DNA, for 5 min at room temperature. Stained cells were washed twice with PBS and imaged
under a ﬂuorescent microscope (excitation, 350 nm; emission,
460 nm). Twenty random high-power ﬁelds from each sample
were selected and blindly quantitated. The number of apoptosis
cells was expressed as percentage of the total cells.

The procedure for caspase-3 activity assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Beyotime, Shanghai,
China). In brief, 10 μl of brain tissue homogenates or NG108-15 cell
lysate was mixed with 90 μl of reaction solution containing caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-pNA) and incubated at 37 °C for
60 min. The absorbance at 405 nm was recorded. The enzyme
activity was presented as U/g protein and 1 U of enzyme was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme required to cleave 1.0 nmol AcDEVD-pNA per h at 37 °C.
2.6. Real-time PCR analysis for GLT-1 mRNA expression
Real-time PCR was carried out to quantify the GLT-1 mRNA
levels in brain tissue or NG108-15 cell. Total RNA was isolated by
using TRIzol reagent (TakaRa, Dalian, China) and the purity and
concentration of RNA were determined spectrophotometrically.
500 ng of RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reaction by a
transcription Kit following the manufacturer's instructions
(DRR037A; TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Quantitative PCR was performed by using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa Dalian, China) in an
ABI 7300 Real-time PCR system. Brieﬂy, a 10-ml reaction mixture
containing 2 ml of cDNA template, 5 ml of SYBR Master mix, 0.20 ml
of ROX, 2.4 ml of H2O, and 0.20 ml of each primer was ampliﬁed by
the following procedures: denaturing at 95 °C for 10 min and 40
cycles of the ampliﬁcation step (denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s,
annealing and extension at 60 °C for 31 s). All ampliﬁcation reactions were performed in triplicate and the averages of the
threshold cycles were used to interpolate curves using the 7300
System SDS Software. The PCR primers for GLT-1 were 5′-

150 bp. Here, β-actin served as a loading control, and the results
were expressed as the ratio of GLT-1 mRNA to beta-actin mRNA.
2.7. Western blot analysis for GLT-1 protein levels
Brain tissues or NG108-15 cells were homogenized in ice-cold
lysis buffer (250 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 20% vol/vol glycerol, 4% SDS
and Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail), sonicated for
1 min, and then centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000g. The protein
concentration was measured by a BCA Protein Assay kit (Beyotime,
Shanghai, China). Western blots were performed according to
standard techniques. Brieﬂy, samples containing 20–60 μg of
protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and then the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes.
Blots were incubated with rabbit anti-GLT-1 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were also incubated with a mouse anti- β-actin antibody and used as a loading control (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
The signals of bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA)

through Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS System (Bio-Rad, Philadelphia, USA). The densitometric analysis was conducted with
Image J 1.43 (National Institutes of Health).
2.8. Measurement of glutamate level
The commercial kit designed for measurement of glutamate
bases on the dehydrogenation of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate
accompanied by reduction of NAD þ to NADH. The conversion of
NAD þ to NADH is measured spectrophotometrically and is proportional to the amount of glutamate that is oxidized. The procedures were performed following the instructions provided by the
manufacturer (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).
Brieﬂy, 0.5 ml of plasma or culture medium and 1.5 l of work solution were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. The absorbance at 340 nm was monitored and glutamate levels were calculated according to a standard curve made from the standard
solutions provided by the supplier.
2.9. Statistical analysis
SPSS software (Version 19.0, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was
used for statistical analysis. Data were expressed as mean 7 S.E.M.
Differences in values among the multiple groups were determined

another index for apoptosis, which was attenuated by MLB
(Fig. 2C). The vehicle did not show any effects on apoptosis and
caspase-3 activity.

3. Results

3.3. MLB blocks of GLT-1 protein downregulation by inhibition of
miR-107

3.1. MLB attenuates I/R-induced neurological deﬁcit score and neuronal cell death
A 5-point rating scale of neurological deﬁcit score is a well
recognized method for evaluating the neurological function in
MCAO rat model. Compared to the control rats, there was no signiﬁcant change in neurological function in rats from the sham
group. Two h of cerebral ischemia plus 24 h of reperfusion caused
a signiﬁcant increase in neurological deﬁcit score, an effect was
attenuated by MLB treatment (Fig. 1B). In agreement with the
results of neurological deﬁcit score, there was no infarct in both
control and sham groups. I/R caused a dramatic increase in infarct
volume, and this effect was suppressed by pretreatment with MLB
(Fig. 1C and D). The vehicle of MLB had no such effects.

In agreement with the ﬁndings in our previous study (Yang
et al., 2014), there was no signiﬁcant change in miR-107 expression in rat brains of the sham group compared to that in the
control group, whereas I/R treatment dramatically elevated miR107 expression; this elevation was attenuated by MLB (Fig. 3A). As
a potential target gene of miR-107, GLT-1 mRNA and protein expression was signiﬁcantly down-regulated in brain tissue following I/R accompanied by elevated plasma levels of glutamate, and
these changes were reversed by MLB treatment (Fig. 3C and D)
except the effect on GLT-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3B). The vehicle
of MLB did not show similar effect.
3.4. Incubation with MLB reduces H/R-induced apoptosis in NG10815 cells

3.2. MLB ameliorates cellular apoptosis caused by I/R
As shown in Fig. 2A, there was no TUNEL-positive cells in both
control and sham groups. I/R injury dramatically increased the
number of TUNEL-positive cells per cm2, and this increase was
signiﬁcantly suppressed by MLB (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the
TUNEL data, I/R injury signiﬁcantly increased caspase-3 activity,

To further verify the results regarding MLB in the rat model of
cerebral I/R, a nerve cell (NG108-15) model of H/R was utilized to
mimic the in vivo study. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, the percentage
of apoptotic cells in the H/R group was markedly elevated compared with that in the control group, and the elevated apoptosis
was abolished by with MLB (10 μM). As expected, caspase-3

activity was signiﬁcantly increased, and this increase was suppressed in the presence of MLB (Fig. 4C). The vehicle did not show
effect on apoptosis and caspase-3 activity.
3.5. MLB abrogates the reduction of GLT-1 protein by suppressing
miR-107 upregulation following H/R
Expectedly, miR-107 expression in NG108-15 cells was upregulated following H/R, which was consistent with the results of
animals after I/R, and the upregulated miR-107 expression was
suppressed by incubation with MLB (Fig. 5A). In agreement with
the results of experiments in vivo, both mRNA and protein expression of GLT-1 was signiﬁcantly downregulated in NG108-15
cells following H/R concomitant with elevated glutamate level in
culture medium, and these results were reversed by MLB treatment (10 μM, Fig. 5C and D) except the effect on GLT-1 mRNA
expression (Fig. 5B). The MLB effects on GLT protein expression
and glutamate accumulation were not observed in vehicle-treated
cells.
4. Discussion
In the present study, by using a rat model of cerebral I/R injury
or a nerve cell model of H/R injury, we evaluated the protective

effect of MLB on ischemic brain or hypoxia NG108-15 cells and
explored whether these effects were involved with the suppression of miR-107 expression and glutamate clearance. Our results
clearly showed that I/R or H/R treatment signiﬁcantly increased
neurological dysfunction, brain tissue or cell injury (such as neuronal cell death) concomitant with elevated miR-107 expression
and glutamate levels as well as a down-regulation of GLT-1 expression; these effects were signiﬁcantly attenuated by MLB. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate
that the neuroprotective effect of MLB against excitotoxicity is
related to the regulation of miR-107/GLT-1 pathway.
It is well known that excitotoxicity following cerebral I/R is
primarily due to the accumulation of glutamate (Kostandy, 2012).
So far, there were ﬁve subtypes of glutamate transporters (EAAT1EAAT5) reported. Among them, GLT-1 (also known as EAAT2 or
SLC1A2) is responsible for the majority of glutamate clearance (up
to 90%) in central nervous system (Bjornsen et al., 2014). A number
of studies showed that down-regulation of GLT-1 but not other
subtypes results in a decrease in the capability of glutamate
clearance following cerebral ischemia (Ketheeswaranathan et al.,
2011). However, the mechanisms underlying the down-regulation
of GLT-1 expression remain largely unknown. In our recent study,
we screened a serial of brain-speciﬁc or brain-enriched miRNAs
and found that miR-107 suppressed GLT-1 expression in brains

underwent I/R. The reverse correlation between miR-107 and GLT1 expression was further conﬁrmed by the present study. These
results indicate that miR-107 may serve as a novel target for the
prevention of cerebral I/R injury.
There is growing evidence that the action of many drugs, including Chinese herbal medicine, can be mediated through regulation of miRNA expression (Wang et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2012).
As a popular Chinese herbal medicine, Danshen has been used for
a long period of time to remove blood stasis and promote blood
circulation (Zhou et al., 2005), which are beneﬁcial to ischemic
heart or brain diseases (Cheng, 2007). Earlier studies mainly paid
attention to the lipophilic ingredients of Danshen while recent
studies focused more on hydrophilic compounds (Zhou et al.,
2005). Up to date, more than 50 ingredients have been isolated
and identiﬁed from the aqueous extracts of Danshen. Among
them, MLB has attracted the most attention because it is a major
aqueous extract ingredient of Danshen and preserves the most
pharmacological activities of Danshen (Chen et al., 2011; Wu and
Wang, 2012), such as anti-oxidation (Quan et al., 2013b), anti-inﬂammation and anti-apoptosis (Quan et al., 2013a, 2014). Furthermore, recent studies have demonstrated that MLB possesses
the property of anti-excitotoxicity (Xiao et al., 2013), but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Based on our
recent ﬁndings regarding the role of miR-107/GLT-1 pathway in
excitatory neurotoxicity in ischemic brain (Yang et al., 2014), we
hypothesized that MLB exerts the inhibitory effect on excitotoxicity through regulation of miR-107/GLT-1 pathway. In this
study, we indeed found that administration of MLB was able to
suppress the I/R-induced miR-107 expression in rat brain

concomitant with an increase in GLT-1 protein level and a decrease
in plasma glutamate level. To corroborate the ﬁndings in animal
experiments, we performed the in vitro experiments with MLB in
NG108-15 cells. Consistent with the ﬁndings in vivo, MLB treatment signiﬁcantly attenuated H/R-induced miR-107 expression,
accompanied by an increase in GLT-1 protein level as well as a
decrease in glutamate level in culture medium. These results
support our hypothesis. In both animal and cell experiments, MLB
suppressed I/R- or H/R-induced miR-107 overexpression, and this
action only led to an increase in GLT-1 protein expression but not
mRNA expression, suggesting that miR-107 impedes the translation of GLT-1 protein from existing mRNA without affecting its
gene transcription.
In summary, the results presented in this study demonstrate,
for the ﬁrst time, that MLB protects the brain from excitatory
neurotoxicity caused by I/R, and this effect is related to an elevation of GLT-1 protein expression and an accelerated glutamate
clearance, resulting from the suppression of miR-107 expression.
