Neuroprotective agents can rescue ischemic penumbra in cerebral ischemia. However, the clinically effective neuroprotective agents for cerebral ischemic injury remain deﬁcient in clinic so far. This study was
undertaken to investigate the brain protective effect of 002C-3 and its potential mechanisms in rats, and
its preliminary toxicity in mice. A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model in rats was
used to evaluate its effect and mechanism, a dose limited experiment was used to evaluate its preliminary toxicity. 10–50 ␮g/kg of 002C-3 (single iv bolus after reperfusion) signiﬁcantly reduced neurological
scores, infarct volumes and brain water contents, and the effect was more potent than that of magnolol
under the same mole dose; 50 ␮g/kg of 002C-3 signiﬁcantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive
cells, reduced the activity of caspase-3, and lowered the autophagy-related proteins LC3-II and Beclin-1
level in I-R cerebral tissue. At 1000 times’ dose of high effective dose (ip) 002C-3 failed to show evident
toxicity in mice, and the mean body weight of mice treated with 002C-3 was almost the same as that of
the vehicle control, but magnolol caused evident toxicity and death. In conclusion, 002C-3 has signiﬁcant
protective effect against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury; the effect is more potent than magnolol;
this effect is maybe associated with its inhibition of both apoptosis and autophagy; its toxicity is greatly
reduced compared to magnolol. These results provided data for its further research and development.

1. Introduction
Cerebral ischemia or ischemia–reperfusion (I–R) is a complex
pathophysiological process including multiple mechanisms such as
excitatory amino acid toxicity, ion disequilibrium, oxidative stress,
inﬂammation, autophagy, apoptosis and necrosis etc. [1]. Neuroprotection as an approach for the salvage of cerebral ischemia
penumbra have attracted much attention [2]. However, many of

neuroprotectants failed to be applied into clinical treatment due
to negative clinical results or serious side effects [3,4]. Therefore,
the effective neuroprotectant for cerebral ischemic injury remain
clinically difﬁdent so far.
Magnolol and honokiol, the major bioactive constituents isolated from the bark of Magnolia ofﬁcinalis, have been demonstrated
to reduce the cerebral injury in rats [5–7]. Magnolol protects
brain again ischemic injury through anti-oxidation [8] antiinﬂammation [9,10], regulating inhibitory amino acids level or
effect [11,12]. These data demonstrate that magnolol is a compound with multiple targets for neuroprotection. However, the
low water-solubility and low safety has limited their research and
application.

002C-3 is a newly synthesized derivative of magnolol with
good water-solubility. In this study, its effect on cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion, the preliminary toxicity and potential
mechanisms were investigated to evaluate its effectiveness and
preliminary safety, and reveal its action mechanism.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
002C-3 was prepared by Beijing Honghui Meditech Co., Ltd.
China; diluted in NS before use. Magnolol obtained from Beijing Honghui Meditech Co., Ltd. China, prepared with DMSO and
then diluted with normal saline (NS) by 200 times before use, the
ﬁnal DMSO volume received by rats was 0.25 ␮l/kg in the effectiveness experiment, and prepared with the vehicle for magnolol
(PEG400:ethanol:water = 5:4:1) in acute toxicity.
Male S–D rats (240–280 g) were provided by Department of Laboratory Animal Science, Peking University Health Science Center.
Protocol for animal handling was approved by Beijing Committee
for Animal Use and Care. The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Peking University
Health Science Center (Permit number: LA2013-69).
2.2. Rat MCAO reperfusion model and agents treatment
A model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO)
was prepared as described previously [7]. Shortly, rats was anesthetized with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, ip), the common carotid
artery (CCA), the external carotid artery (ECA) and the internal
carotid artery (ICA) were exposed, and right CCA and ICA were
blocked with microvascular clips, then the right MCA was occluded
by introduction of a nylon ﬁlament through ECA. The ﬁlament
was removed 2 h after MCAO. Sham-operated control rats received
the same procedure except ﬁlament introduction. The body temperature of rats was maintained and monitored at 37 ± 0.5 ◦ C by
holding operation board. Rats were randomly assigned to six groups
(n = 10): sham group, vehicle group (NS), 002C-3-treated groups in
different doses (2, 10 or 50 ␮g/kg equal to 4.3, 21 or 107 nmol/kg),
magnolol-treated group (28.5 ␮g/kg or 107 nmol/kg). Vehicle or
agents were immediately administered after reperfusion (within
5 min, iv).
Neurological deﬁcit was evaluated at 24 h after reperfusion
according to the Longa’s method [13] by other experimenter who
is blind to animal treatment. Then the brains were collected and
weighed, and cut into 5 coronal slices of 2-mm, then colorized
with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chlorid (TTC, Amresco, USA) for
15 min at 37 ◦ C with ﬁxation in 4% paraformaldehyde. TTC-stained
sections were photographed and the images were analyzed using
image analysis software (NIH Image) to obtain infarct areas, and
then compiled to obtain the infarct volume (mm3 ).
Cerebral edema extent was evaluated by measuring brain water
content as the described [14] with some modiﬁcations. In brief,
brains are immediately weighed once they were collected, then
dried in an oven at 110 ◦ C for 16 h after photograph and weighed
again. Brain water content is calculated as follows: Brain water
content (%) = [(wet weight − dry weight)/wet weigh] × 100%.
The evaluation of neurological score, infarction volume and
water content was operated by other experimenter who was
blinded to grouping and treating.
2.3. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL)
Rats were anesthetized deeply with chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg,
ip) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde 24 h

after reperfusion. Then brains were collected and ﬁxed in 10%
buffered formalin solution for 48 h, and then embedded in parafﬁn.
TUNEL staining was performed as the protocol of in situ apoptosis detection kit (KeyGen Biotech, Nanjing, China). Brains were cut
into 10 mm thick coronal sections at the level of the bregma, and
then incubated with a TUNEL mixture, followed by streptavidin FITC. TUNEL staining was detected under a ﬂuorescence microscope
(Olympus IX71). Three sections from each animal were viewed by
two observers blinded to the origin of the slides. The TUNEL positive cells were counted in 10 non-overlapping high-power ﬁelds
(6200) covering the majority of striatum each section.

were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 ◦ C, and the supernatants were collected. The protein concentration was determined
by BCA assay (M&C Gene Technology, Beijing, China) and diluted to
10 ␮g/␮l. The activity of caspase-3 was detected using a Colorimetric Assay Kit (KeyGen Biotech, Nanjing, China). 500 ␮g of proteins
were added to 50 ␮l 2 × reaction buffer supplemented with 5 ␮l
caspase-3 substrate, and then incubated at 37 ◦ C away from light
for 4 h. Caspases-3 activities were quantiﬁed spectrophotometrically at a wave length of 405 nm and expressed as the fold of the
activity of sham group protein.
2.5. Western blotting

2.4. Determination of caspase-3 activity
The ischemic tissue samples were collected 24 h after reperfusion and homogenized in cold lysis buffer [15]. The homogenates

Proteins were extracted from ischemic tissue in cold RIPA Lysis
Buffer. Western blotting referred to standard protocols. 35 ␮g
of total protein were separated in 15% SDS–PAGE and blotted

onto PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Antibodies included rabbit anti-Beclin-1 antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit anti-LC3 antibody
(1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit
anti-p62 antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), mouse anti-␤-actin (1:1000, Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China), and appropriate secondary antibodies
(1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Protein
bands were detected with a Chemiluminescent reagent (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). Optical density of the bands was quantiﬁed
in Image Lab software, and the housekeeping protein ␤-actin was
used as a control and tested simultaneously by mouse monoclonal
anti-␤-actin antibody.
2.6. The evaluation of preliminary acute toxicity
Mice were treated with 002C-3, vehicle (NS), magnolol, the vehicle (PEG400:ethanol:H2 O = 4:1:5) for magnolol, respectively. After
received agents (50 mg/kg, ip), mice were observed for 12d. All the
animals were weighed before the treatment and the following days.
Death and toxicity symptoms were recorded.
2.7. Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as mean ± S. E., the one way ANOVA was
used to assess differences among groups. Signiﬁcant differences
between groups were assessed by Tukey test–test and *P < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. 002C-3 protected brain against I–R injury
In I–R model rats, the infarct volume was 169.0 ± 15.5 mm3 .
10 ␮g/kg and 50 ␮g/kg 002C-3 reduced the infarct volume to
69.0 ± 16.9 mm3 and 14.3 ± 3.7 mm3 , respectively; but the infarct
volume for 2 ␮g/kg of 002C-3 was not signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 1A
and B). The inhibitory percents of infarct volume for 10 ␮g/kg
and 50 ␮g/kg of 002C-3 were about 59.2% and 91.5%, respectively.
Besides, 10–50 ␮g/kg of 002C-3 reduced the neurological deﬁcit
scores in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C) and signiﬁcantly
decreased brain water content (Fig. 1D).
3.2. 002C-3 reduced TUNEL positive cells in I–R-injured
hemisphere
TUNEL positive cells in the brain tissue of sham group
were 17.0 ± 2.3 cells/2500 ␮m. It was 190.7 ± 25.8 and
48.5 ± 10.6 cells/2500 ␮m for model rats and for 50 mg/kg of
002C-3-treated rats, respectively (Fig. 2A and B). The results
showed that 002C-3 signiﬁcantly reduced neural cell apoptosis.
3.3. 002C-3 inhibited caspase-3 activity in I–R-injured
hemisphere
The caspase-3 relative activity was expressed as the folds of
sham operation group. It was 3.10 ± 0.34 and 1.70 ± 0.32 for model
rats and for 50 mg/kg of 002C-3-treated rats, respectively (Fig 2C).
The results showed that 002C-3 signiﬁcantly decreased caspase-3
relative activity.
3.4. 002C-3 inhibited autophagy in I–R-injured hemisphere
The expression levels of proteins related to autophagy were
examined in I–R injury brain tissue, concurrent increase of both
Beclin-1 and LC3B-II represents the activation of autophagy. The

relative expression of both Beclin-1 and LC3B-II were signiﬁcantly
increased in I–R semi-brain, and 002C-3 signiﬁcantly reduced the
elevated expression of the two proteins (Fig. 3A–C) by 83.5% and
90.2%, respectively. The results suggest that 002C-3 may also confer
the neuroprotective effect via inhibiting the autophagy activated by
I–R injury.
3.5. The preliminary acute toxicity
002C-3 and its precursor magnolol (1000 × 50 ␮g/kg, ip) or vehicles were administered to mice. No abnormal symptoms were
observed for animals treated with 002C-3 and vehicles (NS). However, magnolol caused hypokinesia and lethargy of mice, and 100%
death within 4d. Body weights of mice treated with 002C-3 and
its vehicles in the two weeks did not show signiﬁcant difference,
and the vehicle for magnolol did not induce any abnormal symptoms in mice and the body weight of mice did not show signiﬁcant
difference compared with normal saline (Fig. 4).

4. Discussion
Magnolol is a compound with neuroprotective activity [5], but
has some shortcoming. 002C-3 was synthesized with magnolol as a
precursor and its water-solubility has been greatly increased. This
study demonstrates that its pharmacological effect remains prominent on cerebral I–R injury in rats and its toxicity was remarkably
reduced.
Our results showed that 002C-3 markedly improved neurological deﬁcit scores, reduced both infarct volume and brain edema
when it was given by single iv bolus at reperfusion. We simultaneously observed the effects of magnolol. 002C-3 (107 nmol/L equal
to 50 ␮g/kg) reduced the infarct volume by 91.5%, which is much
stronger than that of magnolol (107 nmol/kg) which reduced the
infarct volume by 54.1%, and the effects on neurological deﬁcit
scores and brain water contents were similar to that on infarct
volume (Fig. 1), suggesting 002C-3 is a potent neuroprotectant in
I–R brain. In addition, as a magnolol derivative, 002C-3 likely has a
longer therapeutic window, since the therapeutic window of magnolol in I–R brain is up to 4 h[5].
Apoptosis has been implicated in cerebral ischemic injury [16],
and honokiol has been proved to inhibit endothelial cell apoptosis
[17] and obovatol inhibits HT22 cell apoptosis [18], respectively.
However the effect of magnolol on apoptosis have not been found
in vivo. We investigated the effect of 002C-3, a derivative of magnolol, on apoptosis induced by I–R injury in vivo. Results showed
that 002C-3 reduced caspase-3 activity in I–R-injured hemisphere
by 44.6%, and decreased TUNEL positive cells by 74.6% (Fig. 2). The
inhibition level of caspase-3 activity is lower than that of TUNEL
positive cells, which maybe is because TUNEL positive cells were
detected in the injured core region and caspase-3 was determined
in the injured hemisphere. However, this observation suggests that
002C-3 may exert its neuroprotective effect through the inhibition
of neural cells apoptosis.
Autophagy has been demonstrated to be involved in cerebral
injury induced by ischemic stroke [19]. Beclin-1 and LC3 were two
reliable markers in the study of autophagy [20,21]. LC3 is expressed
as three isoforms in mammalian cells, LC3A, LC3B and LC3C, but
only LC3B-II correlates with increased levels of autophagic vesicles [22]. Monitoring of the levels of Beclin-1 and LC3B-II revealed
an extremely decrease of both Beclin-1 and LC3B-II in the 002C3-treated tissue, compared with vehicle-treated tissue (Fig. 3),
suggesting that 002C-3 inhibits autophagy, and thus contributes
its cerebral protective effect.

Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion caused oxidation injury, excitatory amino acid toxicity and calcium overload in cells. Magnolol,
the precursor of 002C-3, prevents excitotoxicity [5] and has
anti-oxidant properties[8] and anti-apoptosis [18]. These effects
decrease cell injury and death (apoptosis and necrosis). 002C-3
was inferred to have these properties. This study found it inhibited apoptosis and autophagy in I–R injured tissue, suggesting its
anti-autophagic effect could be associated with its reduction of cell
injury and death.
In studies related apoptosis and autophagy, we used the tissue of
vehicle treated animal as a sham control. However, it could be better when the contralateral not-injured hemisphere has been taken
as a sham control.
When both 002C-3 and magnolol were administrated to mice
with a very high dose (1000 times of the effective high dose, ip), no
sign of toxicity or death was observed in mice treated with 002C-3,
its vehicle or vehicle for magnolol also failed to induce any abnormal symptom. However, magnolol caused the death of 100% mice
within 4d. These ﬁndings suggest that 002C-3 possesses a much
lower toxicity than magnolol. The reason for this is possibly due
to the induction of substituent group with cyto-protective action.
In addition, its good water solubility could allow it get slowly into
brain to reduce toxicity. These presumptions need to be conﬁrmed.
In summary, 002C-3, a newly synthesized derivative of magnolol, has prominent brain protective effect in I–R rats. It may exert
neuroprotective effect, at least partly, through inhibiting the processes of apoptosis and autophagy in I–R tissue. It has better safety
than its precursor magnolol.
