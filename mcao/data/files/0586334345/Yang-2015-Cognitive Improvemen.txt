Abstract Environment enrichment (EE) has been demonstrated to improve the cognitive impairment that is induced
by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH), but the underlying
mechanism has not yet been elucidated. This study aimed to
investigate the role of endogenous neuroprotection in EEinduced cognitive improvement in rats with CCH.
Permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusions
(2-vessel occlusions (2VOs)) were performed to induce
CCH in male adult Wistar rats. Four weeks after the surgeries,
the rats were exposed to enriched environments for
4 weeks (6 h/day). Subsequently, we assessed the effects
of EE on cognitive function, brain histone acetylation levels,
neuroprotection-related transcription factors (i.e., cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), phospho-CREB
(p-CREB), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) α, and
nuclear regulatory factor 2 (Nrf2)), and oxidative stress
and histological changes in the brain. After 2VO, the rats
exposed to the EE treatment exhibited increased acetylation
of histone 4 and increased p-CREB and Nrf2 protein levels in
the brain. HIF-1α levels were increased after 2VO and reduced after EE treatment. The oxidative damage, histopathological changes in the brain, and spatial learning and memory
impairments induced by 2VO were subsequently restored after EE treatment. These data indicate that EE promotes the
acetylation of histone 4, regulates some neuroprotectionrelated transcription factors, attenuates oxidative damage,
and protects against the histopathological damage to the brain

Introduction
Cerebral hypoperfusion has been demonstrated to be associated with the cognitive deficits of both Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) patients (de la Torre 2002;
Osawa et al. 2004). In addition to the clinical reports, an increasing number of experimental studies have also proven that
reduced cerebral blood supply can cause progressive cognitive
impairment (Farkas et al. 2007). Thus, chronic cerebral

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 56:278–289

hypoperfusion (CCH) is thought to be one of the initial conditions that are critical to the development of cognitive dysfunction (Gorelick et al. 2011; Ruitenberg et al. 2005).
Cerebral hypoperfusion can cause deranged energy metabolism, protein synthesis abnormalities, glial activation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, neuronal damage, and white matter
lesions; these factors might be the pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to cognitive impairment (Farkas et al.
2007; Liu and Zhang 2012). Despite the detrimental effects of
hypoperfusion, such as declines in cellular oxygen levels and
energy supplies, hypoperfusion also induces compensatory or
endogenous adaptive and regenerative mechanisms that defend against hypoperfusion injury and allow for the recovery
of brain function (Farkas et al. 2007; Choy et al. 2006). The
regulation of the endogenous adaptive and neuroprotective
processes includes the concerted activation of various
transcription factors that mediate the upregulation of
neurotrophic factors, antioxidant enzymes, and proteins
that are involved in cellular energy metabolism. These
transcription factors include the nuclear regulatory factor
2 (Nrf2)–antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway, the
cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway,
and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) (Stranahan and
Mattson 2012; Kitagawa 2007). Because a large number of
clinical trials that have sought to identify protective strategies
against dementia have failed, the recruitment of endogenous
neuroprotective pathways represents a potential strategy for
the development of therapeutics for the cognitive impairment
induced by CCH.
Environment enrichment (EE) is a housing manipulation that provides a complex combination of enhanced
sensory, cognitive, and motor stimulation and has been
extensively used to investigate the influence of the environment on behavior, particularly in terms of complex
cognition (Nithianantharajah and Hannan 2006). Several experimental studies have reported beneficial effects of EE on
cognitive function during normal ageing and in models of AD
and VaD (Nithianantharajah and Hannan 2006; Gobbo and
O'Mara 2004). We previously demonstrated that EE can ameliorate learning and memory impairments induced by CCH
(Sun et al. 2010). Although the mechanisms by which EE
preserves cognition remain obscure, numerous studies have
shown that functional improvement related to EE is associated
with the upregulation of neurotrophic factors, the enhancement of synaptic plasticity, the stimulation of neurogenesis
(Nithianantharajah and Hannan 2006), and reductions of apoptosis and oxidative damage (Herring et al. 2010; Stranaha
et al. 2010; Cechetti et al. 2012). Based on these beneficial
effects of EE, we hypothesize that the activation of endogenous neuroprotective pathways might be implicated in the
beneficial effects of EE on cognition.
The present study was therefore designed to validate the
effects of EE on CCH-related cognitive impairment and to

279

investigate whether EE-induced cognitive protection is associated with the activation of endogenous neuroprotection.
Because permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion
(2-vessel occlusion (2VO)) in rats is widely accepted as an
adequate experimental model of CCH that successfully imitates the pathophysiological features of human AD and VaD
(Farkas et al. 2007), 2VO was used to induce CCH in the
present study. The nuclear expression of endogenous
neuroprotection-related transcription factors and the corresponding protective effects were measured after 2VO rats
were exposed to EE.

Materials and Methods
Animals and Housing
The experiments were performed on 7-week-old male Wistar
rats (Laboratory Animal Research Center of Wuhan University,
Wuhan, China) that weighed 220–250 g at the beginning of the
study. Forty-eight rats (four per cage) were group-housed in
polypropylene cages (35 cm×29 cm×21 cm) in a controlled
environment at 22±2 °C with 55±5 % humidity and maintained on 12-h light/dark cycle with lights on at 07:00 and ad
libitum access to water and food. All animal procedures were
performed with protocols that were designed in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal
Ethics Committee of the Medical School of Wuhan University.
Model Establishment and Experimental Design
The animals were matched for body weight and randomly
assigned to three groups in accordance with the random number table: (1) sham surgery plus a standard environment (sham
+ SE), n=16; (2) 2VO surgery plus a standard environment
(2VO + SE), n=16; and (3) 2VO surgery plus an enriched
environment (2VO + EE), n=16.
2VO Animal Model The 2VO surgeries were performed as
previously described (Xu et al. 2010). Food and water were
withheld for 1 day prior to surgery. The rats were anesthetized
with 10 % chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.))
and allowed to breathe spontaneously. The bilateral common
carotid arteries of the rats were exposed via a midline ventral
incision, carefully separated from the vagal nerves, and permanently ligated with silk sutures. The rats that underwent
sham operations were treated in a similar manner with the
exception that the common carotid arteries were not ligated.
During surgery, body temperature was maintained at 37.5±
0.5 °C. After surgery, the wounds were sutured, and rats were
allowed to recover from anesthesia before being returned to
their cages.

280

Enriched Environment The EE protocols that we employed
were described by Fischer et al. (Fischer et al. 2007). Eight
rats were housed together in a large specially designed cage
(90 cm long×75 cm wide×45 cm high) that contained objects
including toys, tunnels of different colors and shapes,
running wheels, and wooden or metal stairs and platforms (Fig. 1). The objects were changed on a daily
basis. For the SE groups, four animals were housed in
each standard laboratory cage, and each cage contained
sawdust bedding but no additional objects. Food and water
were available ad libitum to both groups during the period
of enrichment.
After surgery, all rats were housed in the standard environment (SE) with free access to food and water for 4 weeks.
During the subsequent 4 weeks, the 2VO + EE animals were
exposed to an EE (6 h each day from 10:00 to 16:00), whereas
the sham + SE and 2VO + SE animals remained in the SE.
The spatial learning and memory performances of the rats
were evaluated on the days after the environmental treatment
periods via the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The rats were
subsequently sacrificed. Samples for Western blot assays and
histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses were
obtained from the brains of the rats.
MWM Test
The MWM consisted of a black circular pool of 2.0 m in
diameter that was filled to a depth of 32 cm with opaque water
at a temperature of 20±1 °C. For the cued training (four trials
per day for the first 5 days), the rats were released into the
water facing the sidewalls at four different locations, and each
rat was allowed 60 s to find the platform. If the rat did not find
the platform, it was guided to the platform and allowed to rest
there for at least 20 s. The escape latencies were recorded
during the 5-day cued training. After the last cued trial of
day 5, the platform was removed from the pool, and each rat
received one 30-s swim probe trial on day 6; the time spent in
the target quadrant in which the platform had previously been

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 56:278–289

located during training was recorded. All data were acquired
via a computerized video imaging analysis system.
Western Blotting
After behavioral testing, rats were anesthetized as described
above (i.e., 10 % chloral hydrate solution, 350 mg/kg, i.p.),
and the brains were rapidly removed and dissected to obtain
the hippocampi. The tissue was immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until Western blotting. Nuclear
proteins were extracted from the hippocampus using a kit
from the Keygen Institute of Biotechnology according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Keygen, Nanjing, China).
Protein samples (40 μg) were fractionated with 10 % or
12 % SDS-PAGE, transferred to 0.45-μm PVDF membranes
at 200 mA for 1 h, and stained with Ponceau red to confirm
equal loading. The blots were blocked with 5 % nonfat milk in
Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1 % Tween-20 (TBST) at
room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Anti-CREB
(Millipore Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA,
1:1000 dilution), anti-phospho-CREB (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA, 1:1000 dilution), anti-HIF-1α (BD Transduction
Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA, 1:1000 dilution), antiNrf2 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA, 1:1000 dilution), anti-acetyl histone H4 (Lys5/8/12/16, Millipore
Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA, 1:2000 dilution), antiacetyl Histone H3 (Lys14, Millipore Corporation, Billerica,
MA, USA, 1:2000 dilution), and anti-β-actin(Santa Cruz,
Dallas, TX, USA, 1:2000 dilution) were used. The blots were
visualized via chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico,
Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) after a 30-min incubation in the
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse:
1:3000 in TBST, KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA).
Semiquantifications of the immunoreactive bands on the Xray films were performed via optical density analyses (HPIAS
2000, Tongji Qianping Company, Wuhan, China). The densities were normalized to β-actin.
Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry

Fig. 1 Enriched environment example in our experiment

The rats were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with
4 % buffered PFA at pH 7.4. The brain was removed, stored
in fixative for at least 24 h, embedded in paraffin wax, and
coronally sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm. The sections were
subjected to histologic examination using a standard procedure previously been described (Shibata et al. 2004). Klüver–
Barrera (KB) staining was used to observe any histological
changes. The white matter (WM) lesions were graded as normal (grade 0), containing disarranged nerve fibers (grade 1),
exhibiting the formation of marked vacuoles (grade 2), and
exhibiting the disappearance of myelinated fibers (grade 3) by
an investigator who was blind to the experimental conditions.

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 56:278–289

The primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry included those directed against the following: the astrocyte
marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; GeneTex,
Irvine, CA, USA, 1:250 dilution); the microglial marker ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA, 1:100 dilution), and the lipid peroxidation marker 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE; Millipore
Chemicon International, Temecula, CA, USA, 1:500 dilution). After blocking, the sections were incubated with the
primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and the brain slices were
washed and incubated with the secondary antibodies for 1 h at
room temperature. The reaction products were developed
using a 50-μl diaminobenzidine solution. As a negative control, similar sets of sections were stained in the absence of
primary antibody. In the sections that were immunostained
for GFAP or Iba-1, the numbers of immunopositive cells were
counted in three visual fields (cells/mm2) in the cerebral cortex; corpus callosum; and the CA1, CA2, CA3, and DG subregions of the hippocampus at 100× magnification using the
Image-Pro Plus 6.0 image analysis software. Additionally, the
mean integral optical density (IOD) values of the cells that
were positively immunostained for 4-HNE were obtained.
First, we selected five slices that contained the largest differences in staining intensity and then analyzed them according
to the manual to select the most appropriate parameters to
ensure the inclusion of the maximal number of hippocampal
pyramidal cells and the minimal number of other background
cells. Next, we used these specific parameters to reanalyze all
of the stained slices. GraphPad Prism 5.0 software was used to
analyze the differences between groups.
Statistical Analyses
All results are presented as the mean±the SEM. The statistical
analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software
(GraphPad Software, Inc., USA). Differences in escape latencies were analyzed with a two-way repeated measures
ANOVA, and Bonferroni posttests were used for post hoc
multiple treatment comparisons. Kruskal–Wallis test followed
by Dunn’s test was used to compare the severity of WM lesions between the groups. All other measurements were analyzed using one-way ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni post
hoc tests. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.

Results
EE Ameliorated the Spatial Learning and Memory Deficits
Induced by CCH
The rats were subjected to five consecutive days of training in
the MWM to investigate their spatial learning abilities following 4 weeks of EE or SE treatment. The escape latency

281

decreased significantly during training (F(4,113)= 42.88,
p<0.01), and there was a significant difference among the
three groups (F(2,113) = 19.41, p < 0.01; Fig. 2a). The
Bonferroni posttest indicated that beginning on day 2, rats in
the CCH group (2VO + SE) took significantly longer to find
the platform compare to the sham + SE rats (days 2 and 5,
p<0.05; days 3–4, p<0.01). The hypoperfused rats treated
with EE (2VO + EE rats) took significantly less time to find
the platform than did their 2VO + SE counterparts on days 3–5
(days 3 and 5, p<0.05; day 4, p<0.01).
As shown in Fig. 2b, in the probe trials after the platform
was removed, memory was evaluated by measuring the time
spent in the target quadrant. We observed a significant difference in time spent in the target quadrant among the three
groups (F(2,18)=10.02, p<0.01), and Bonferroni posttest indicated that the CCH rats (2VO + SE) spent less time in the
platform region than did the sham + SE rats (p<0.01). EE
significantly increased the amount of time that the hypoperfusion rats remained in the platform region relative to the SE
group of hypoperfusion rats (2VO + SE rats; p<0.05).
EE Regulated the Nuclear Protein Levels of Transcription
Factors That Are Related to Endogenous Neuroprotection
Western blotting analyses were used to examine the nuclear
protein levels of target transcription factors (CREB/phosphoCREB (p-CREB), Nrf2, HIF-1α) in the hippocampus (Fig. 3).
As shown in Fig. 3b, the level of p-CREB in the nucleus
decreased following 2VO surgery (p<0.05), and this level
was restored following EE treatment (p<0.05). The expression of CREB exhibited a similar trend between these two
groups, but this trend was not statistically significant
(p>0.05, Fig. 3a). No difference in Nrf2 was observed after
2VO surgery (p>0.05), but EE treatment significantly increased Nrf2 nuclear translocation in the hippocampus
(p<0.05; Fig. 3c). Additionally, the CCH induced by 2VO
led to increased levels of HIF-1α in the nuclei of the hippocampus relative to the levels observed in the sham group
(p<0.01; Fig. 3d), and this level was reduced after EE treatment, although the latter difference was not significant
(p>0.05; Fig. 3d).
The Effect of EE on Histone Acetylation
Histone acetylation results in the alteration of chromatin into a
more open and relaxed conformation that facilitates the interaction of transcription factors with specific gene promoters
and, thus, the activation of the expression of downstream
genes. The levels of acetylation of histone 3 at lysine 14
(H3K14) and histone 4 at lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16 (H4K5,
H4K8, H4K12, H4K16) in the hippocampi after 2VO and
EE treatment were examined by nuclear protein Western
blotting (Fig. 4).

The results indicated that 2VO led to reduced histone 3
(H3K14) and histone 4 (H4K5, H4K8, H4K12, H4K16) acetylation, but these differences were not significantly different
(p>0.05; Fig. 4a, b). EE restored the levels of H4K5, H4K8,
H4K12, and H4K16 acetylation (p<0.01; Fig. 4b) but did not
significantly affect the acetylation of H3K14 (p > 0.05;

the CA1, CA2, and CA3 subregions of the hippocampus
(p<0.05; Fig. 5b). No significant change was observed in
the corpus callosum following 2VO and EE treatment
(p>0.05; Fig. 5b).

EE Attenuated the CCH-Induced Oxidative Damage

EE Treatment Protected Against the Damage to the WM,
Cortex, and Hippocampus

The 4-HNE-modified protein can be used as a marker of oxidative neuronal damage (Calkins et al. 2009). The results of
immunohistochemical analyses of 4-HNE in the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, and hippocampus are shown in Fig. 5.
After 2VO, there were significant increases in the 4-HNE
levels in the cortex and the four subregions of the

WM lesions and glial activation were measured with KB and
immunohistochemical staining.
KB staining revealed that 2VO led to WM lesion in the
corpus callosum (p<0.05; Fig. 6a, d). After EE treatment,
the severities of the WM lesions were reduced, although this
difference was not significant (p>0.05; Fig. 6a, d).

*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 compared to the sham + SE group; #p < 0.05
compared to the 2VO + SE group

Immunohistochemical staining revealed increased densities of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes
in the corpus callosum and hippocampus (CA1, CA3, and DG
subregions) after 2VO (p<0.05 and p<0.01; Fig. 6b, e), and
EE treatment significantly decreased the densities of astrocytes in the corpus callosum and hippocampus (CA1 and
DG subregions; p<0.05). Similarly, 2VO led to increased
numbers of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1
(Iba-1)-positive microglia in the cortex and hippocampus
(CA1, CA3, and DG subregions; p < 0.05 and p < 0.01;
Fig. 6c, f), and the densities of microglia were reduced after
EE in the cortex and CA3 subregion (p<0.05).
Thus, 2VO-induced WM lesions were restored following
EE treatment, and this restoration was paralleled by glial activation in the brain.

Discussion
In this study, we confirmed that EE was capable of reversing
the spatial learning and memory impairments induced by
CCH in rats as we have demonstrated previously (Sun et al.
2010; Zhang et al. 2013). We also revealed that this reversal
was accompanied by the activations of some transcription
factors and that the induced downstream neuroprotective reactions included the preservation of WM integrity, alleviation
of oxidative damage, and inhibition of glial activation in the
brain.
CREB is expressed in all cells in the brain and is a member
of a family of proteins that function as transcription factors.
There is strong evidence that CREB and the CREB-mediated
system are involved in learning, memory, and neuronal

survival and differentiation (Kitagawa 2007). Activation of
CREB leads to the expression of genes that promote cell survival and synaptic plasticity, such as the neurotrophic factor
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays pivotal roles in synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, and this
activation is also involved in mechanisms that are protective
against excitotoxic, oxidative, and metabolic stress (Cheng
and Mattson 1994; Spina et al. 1992). Here, we found that
neither CCH nor EE treatment altered the nuclear level
of CREB protein, but these treatments did affect CREB
activation. As shown in the results, CCH reduced the
expression of p-CREB, and this effect was rescued by
exposure to EE. Consistently, a previous study also reported that the level of the CREB-mediated gene BDNF
is restored by EE treatment after CCH (Sun et al. 2010).
Thus, we speculate that EE activates CREB and the CREBmediated system and that this activation might contribute to
the neuroprotection and cognitive improvement that are associated with EE.
Nrf2 is a key transcription factor that modulates the antioxidative ability of brain and mediates the production of a
battery of endogenous anti-oxidative enzymes (Calkins et al.
2009). The Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway is known as
the primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of
oxidative stress (Yang et al. 2014). Moreover, oxidative stress
has been regarded as a common pathophysiological change
and an essential factor in the development of CCH-related
cognitive impairment (Liu and Zhang 2012). Consistently, in
present research, increased lipid peroxidation was observed in
the cortex and hippocampus after 2VO. EE reduced the level
of 4-HNE and alleviated the oxidative damage in the brain,
which might have been related to the activated Nrf2 after EE
treatment.
The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-mediated signaling
pathway, which is activated by hypoxia and ischemia, controls

a diverse range of adaptive and protective cellular processes
including angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and cellular metabolism that is targeted at increasing oxygen delivery to tissues
(Karuppagounder and Ratan 2012). HIF-1 is a transcriptional
complex consisting of HIF-1α and HIF-1β subunits. Under
normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is hydroxylated and rapidly degraded. Under hypoxic–ischemic conditions, hydroxylases
are less active; thus, the HIF-1 complex accumulates and
translocates to the nucleus, which results in the transcription of HIF-1 target genes, which, in turn, promotes neuronal adaptation for survival under hypoxic
conditions (Benarroch 2009). We found that HIF-1α,
the functional subunit of HIF-1, was increased in the
hippocampus after 2VO. Our previous study showed
that the CCH induced by 2VO triggers a steady increase
in HIF-1α levels in the hippocampus that begins as
early as 12 h after the operation and continues until at
least 56 days postoperation (Yang et al. 2013). These
findings indicate that the compensatory or endogenous
adaptive response that defends against hypoperfusion might
be activated after 2VO. However, no increase in HIF-1α level
was observed after EE treatment. Therefore, whether EE affects the activation of HIF-1 is unclear. Four weeks of EE
treatment might have alleviated the hypoxic–ischemic conditions in the brains of the 2VO rats, which might have caused
the increases in HIF-1α degradation. This supposition
might explain why no increases in HIF-1α were detected 4 weeks after EE compared to the 2VO + SE rats in
this study. Measurements of the changes in HIF-1α
levels at different time points after EE treatment might
aid the identification of the exact role of EE in the HIF1-mediated signaling pathway.
Additionally, histone acetylation, which has been implicated in the facilitation of the interaction of transcription factors
with specific gene promoters and the activation of

and relaxed chromatin conformation, has recently been implicated in synaptic plasticity and learning behavior (Chuang

et al. 2009). Consistent with the changes observed in some
transcription factors, such as p-CREB and Nrf2, we found that

H4K8, H4K12, H4K16) in the hippocampi of the 2VO rats. A
previous study reported a similar result; EE was found to
increase the levels of hippocampal and cortical acetylation
of histones 3 and 4 as soon as 3 h after treatment in a mouse
model of neurodegenerative disease and to induce recovery
from impaired learning and recovery of lost memories
(Fischer et al. 2007). Moreover, the increments in histone
acetylation that are caused by inhibitors of histone
deacetylases might reinstate learning and memory (Fischer
et al. 2007). Because the alterations to chromatin structure that
are induced by histone acetylation might favor transcriptional
initiation of various transcription factors (Fig. 7), Vecsey et al.
suggested that the enhancement of memory-mediated histone
deacetylase inhibitors is due to the activation of key genes that

are regulated by the CREB/CBP transcriptional complex
(Vecsey et al. 2007). These results suggest that the role of
histone acetylation in the promotion of the transcriptional initiation of transcription factors might also be related to the
cognitive improvements and neuroprotection induced by EE
in the 2VO rats.
Thus, this study demonstrated that the oxidative damage
and histopathological damage to the brain that are induced by
2VO were alleviated by EE treatment in parallel with the
regulation of histone acetylation and some neuroprotectionrelated transcription factors. All of these neuroprotective effects of EE in CCH rats might contribute to the recovery of
spatial learning and memory. Thus, we speculate that the cognitive improvement induced by EE in CCH rats might result

from the upregulation of endogenous neuroprotection. The
recruitment of endogenous neuroprotective pathways might

represent a possible target for therapeutic interventions for
CCH related diseases, such as AD and VaD.

Fig. 7 Transcription factor pathways affected by histone acetylation.
Histone acetylation could transform the condensed chromatin into a
more relaxed structure that is associated with greater levels of gene
transcription. The alterations to chromatin structure that are induced by
histone acetylation might favor transcriptional initiation of various

transcription factors (TFs), including neuroprotective-related TFs
CREB, HIF-1α, and Nrf2. Furthermore, histone acetyltransferases
(HATs), enzymes that acetylate lysine residues on nucleosomal
histones, also regulate the activity of certain TFs
