INTRODUCTION

Abstract—Triheptanoin, an oily substance, consists of glycerol bound to three molecules of heptanoic acid, a C7 oddchain fatty acid. A triheptanoin-rich diet has anaplerotic
eﬀects because heptanoate metabolism yields succinate
which delivers substrates to the Krebs cycle. While previous
studies on the eﬀects of triheptanoin focused on metabolic
disorders and epilepsy, we investigated triheptanoin’s eﬀect
on ischemic stroke. Mice were fed a triheptanoin-enriched
diet for 14 days; controls received soybean oil. Only mice
fed triheptanoin had measurable quantities of oddnumbered fatty acids in the plasma and brain. Transient
ischemia was induced in the brain by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 60 min. One day later, mice
were tested for neurological function (chimney, rotarod
and corner tests) which was found to be better preserved
in the triheptanoin group. Microdialysis demonstrated that
the strong, neurotoxic increase of extracellular glutamate,
which was observed in the mouse striatum during MCAO,
was strongly reduced in triheptanoin-fed mice while glucose
levels were not aﬀected. Triheptanoin diet reduced the
infarct area in stroked mice by about 40%. In ex vivoexperiments with isolated mitochondria, ischemia was
found to cause a reduction of mitochondrial respiratory
activity. This reduction was attenuated by triheptanoin diet
in complex II and IV. In parallel measurements, ATP levels
and mitochondrial membrane potential were reduced in control animals but were preserved in triheptanoin-fed mice. We
conclude that triheptanoin-fed mice which sustained an
experimental stroke had a signiﬁcantly improved neurological outcome. This beneﬁcial eﬀect is apparently due to an
improvement of mitochondrial function and preservation
of the cellular energy state. Our ﬁndings identify triheptanoin as a promising new dietary agent for neuroprotection. Ó 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide
and the most common cause for long-term care (Lopez
et al., 2006; Strong et al., 2007). Although numerous
pharmacological options have been investigated, there
is a dire lack of neuroprotective agents (Dirnagl et al.,
1999). As an alternative option, dietary approaches have
been investigated, and the ketogenic diet – which is successfully used for the treatment of childhood epilepsy –
has shown promising eﬀects in experimental models of
ischemia (Gibson et al., 2005; Gasior et al., 2006). The
strict regimen of the ketogenic diet, however, is poorly
accepted by adults. In the experiments described in this
paper, we tested potential neuroprotective eﬀects of a different (and more palatable) dietary approach, namely the
feeding of an anaplerotic diet. In this approach, intermediates of the citric acid cycle (CAC) are produced from dietary compounds which may aﬀect mitochondrial
metabolism in the brain leading to a replenishment of
the CAC during ischemia, especially when CAC intermediates such as alpha-ketoglutarate or succinate are
removed for the synthesis of large amounts of glutamate
or GABA (Haberg et al., 2009).
Triheptanoin, chemically glycerol triheptanoate, is an
oil which has anaplerotic actions (Brunengraber and
Roe, 2006; Borges and Sonnewald, 2012). It is hydrolyzed to three molecules of heptanoic acid and provides,
after ß-oxidation, six molecules of acetyl-CoA and three
molecules of propionyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is the main supplier for carbon atoms to the Krebs cycle. Propionyl-CoA
can fuel the Krebs cycle via its metabolism
to methylmalonyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA, and succinate
(Brunengraber and Roe, 2006; Borges and Sonnewald,
2012). Succinyl-CoA can also directly be used for energy
production by succinate dehydrogenase, which is in the
complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain
(Kinman et al., 2006; Gu et al., 2010). Triheptanoin was
previously tested for therapeutic eﬀects in inherited metabolic disorders such as pyruvate carboxylase deﬁciency,
adult polyglucosan body disease or various fatty acid oxidation disorders (Mochel et al., 2005; Roe et al., 2010;
Spiekerkoetter et al., 2010), as well as in Huntington’s
disease (Mochel et al., 2010). Borges and coworkers

described beneﬁcial eﬀects of a triheptanoin-rich diet
(35% of calories) in several epileptic models (Willis
et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013). To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst investigation of the eﬀects
of triheptanoin in an experimental stroke model.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

to 10–15% of basal ﬂow during occlusion. After 60 min of
occlusion, the ﬁlament was removed to allow reperfusion
(deﬁned as >50% of basal ﬂow). The skin incision was
closed with surgical clips, treated with local anesthetics,
and mice were allowed to recover in their home cages.
As analgesic agent, mice received buprenorphine
(0.1 mg s.c.) immediately after wound closure and again
eight hours later.

Animals and dietary treatment
Female CD-1 mice (18–22 month, 30–35 g, Charles
River) were kept under standardized conditions: 12-hlight/dark circle, 22 °C temperature, 70% humidity, food
and water available ad libitum. All animal procedures
were carried out to minimize animal suﬀering in
accordance with German and European law. The study
was
registered
with
the
local
authorities
(Regierungspräsidium Darmstadt).
Triheptanoin,
originally
produced
by
Sasol
(Brunsbüttel, Germany), was obtained from B. Braun
(Melsungen, Germany). For the experiments, mice were
fed over 14 days either a control diet (containing
soybean oil) or the triheptanoin-enriched diet. Both
chows were prepared by Ssniﬀ Co. (Soest, Germany).
The test diet contained 14% triheptanoin (w/w), which
represents about 35% of total caloric intake (crude fat:
16.4%; starch 24.7%). The control chow consisted of
the same caloric amount of soybean oil (crude fat:
5.4%; starch 35.7%). The amounts of (crude) protein
(18%), ﬁber (4%), ash (5.5%) and sugar (11%) were
identical in both diets, as were the food additives which
included vitamins A, C, D3, E, K3, and copper.
Measurement of odd-numbered fatty acids
Samples were extracted using the Folch procedure (Folch
et al., 1957). The aqueous phase was dried under a
stream of nitrogen, and the residue was derivatized to
the corresponding trimethylsilyl-ether or ester groups
(Kombu et al., 2011) and measured on a GC–MS
(Agilent 5973 series). The resulting total ion chromatogram was compared to the N.I.S.T database for
qualitative analysis. Quantiﬁcation was performed with
internal and external standards.
Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Transient in vivo-ischemia in mouse brain was induced by
MCAO as previously described (Schwarzkopf et al.,
2013). Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane
(2% in synthetic air) and kept at 37 °C using a thermostatic blanket coupled to a rectal thermometer
(Harvard/Hugo Sachs, March-Hugstetten, Germany).
Through a cervical incision, the left bifurcation of the common carotid artery (CCA) was dissected and all three
branches (CCA, external carotid artery (ECA) and internal
carotid artery (ICA)) were ligated. A 20-mm monoﬁlament
(Doccol, Redlands, California; size 6–0) was inserted into
the ECA and gently advanced through the ICA into the
brain until its tip occluded the origin of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Local cerebral blood ﬂow was measured by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (Moor Instruments,
Devon, UK; AP 0.5, L +3.5 from bregma) and dropped

Behavioral testing
Neurological deﬁcits were determined by behavioral
testing in the morning before surgery and 24 h after
MCAO. The ‘‘Chimney test’’ (modiﬁed from Heinecke,
1987) was performed for each mouse three times before
and after surgery. A mouse was placed head in front at
the entry of a tube (200 mm long and 20-mm diameter).
When the mouse reached the bottom of the tube, the tube
was raised to an angle of 45 degree. All mice responded
by walking backward. The time needed to climb out of the
tube was measured for a maximum of 120 s. In the
‘‘Rotarod test’’ (Jones and Roberts, 1968), all mice were
forced to walk on an accelerating rod (starting at 4 rpm,
increase of 4 rpm every 15 s). The time the mouse was
able to walk on the rod before falling was measured (maximum value 120 s). The occurrence of two consecutive
passive rotations without walking but clinging to the rod
was considered as a fall. Each mouse was tested three
times a day. The ‘‘Corner test’’ was used as described
(Zhang et al., 2002). Mice were placed in a corner (30
degree angle) and the chosen sides to leave the corner
were counted. Each mouse was tested for one trial (maximum time 120 s) before and after surgery. The laterality
index (LI) was calculated: (left turns right turns)/total
number of turns (Bouet et al., 2007).
Microdialysis
For microdialysis experiments, a self-made dialysis probe
was implanted into the left mouse striatum as described
before (Schwarzkopf et al., 2013) one day prior to
MCAO. Mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane (2% in
synthetic air) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. The
probe (exchange length: 2.5 mm, cut-oﬀ 10 kDa) was
implanted using the following coordinates from the
bregma: AP +0.5 mm; L +2.2 mm; DV
3.8 mm
(Franklin and Paxinos, 1997) and ﬁxed at this position
with Multilink Automix (Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan,
Liechtenstein). The wound was treated with local anesthetic (bupivacaine), and mice were allowed to recover
over night in their home cages. Perfusion of the microdialysis probe was started 1 h before MCAO, was sustained
while the MCAO surgery was performed and was continued for 2 h after MCAO. The perfusion ﬂuid was artiﬁcial
cerebrospinal ﬂuid (aCSF: 147 mM NaCl; 4 mM KCl;
1.2 mM CaCl2 and 1.2 mM MgCl2), the perfusion rate
was 2 ll/min, and samples were collected in 10-min intervals. 24 h after MCAO, mice were deeply anesthetized
with isoﬂurane and euthanized by decapitation. Brains
were quickly removed, sectioned coronally into 1-mm
slices and stained with 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC). Images were acquired by a DinoLite camera

203

and infarct areas of both hemispheres were quantiﬁed for
each slice using Image J 1.30.
Glucose and glutamate concentrations in the
microdialysis samples were determined by a CMA-600
microanalyzer (CMA Microdialysis, Stockholm, Sweden);
lower limits of detection for glucose and glutamate were
20 and 1 lM, respectively.
ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potential
(MMP) in dissociated brain cells
For preparation of dissociated brain cells, the mouse
brain was quickly removed, washed in medium 1
(138 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.17 mM Na2HPO4,
0.22 mM KH2PO4, 5.5 mM glucose, 58.4 mM sucrose)
and dissected into the hemispheres (see Stoll and
Mueller, 1991). Each hemisphere was separately shredded with a scalpel in 4 ml of medium 1 and transferred
through a ﬁlter of 200-lm pore size. After addition of
16-ml medium 1 a second ﬁltration (100 lm pore size) followed. The cell-suspensions were washed by three centrifugation (913g; 5 min; 4 °C) and re-suspension steps
(medium 2: 110 mM NaCl, 5.3 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2,
1.0 mM MgCl2, 25 mM glucose, 70 mM sucrose, 20 mM
HEPES). The last re-suspension was conducted with
Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle-Medium (DMEM). ATP levels
were measured using a commercial ATP kit (LT 27102/008, Lonza GmbH, Germany). Luminescence was
measured at 450 nm (Victor X3, Perkin Elmer, USA).
For measurement of MMP the cellular suspension was
pipetted onto a 24-well plate. Addition of 5-ll
Rhodamin123 (20 lM in Hanks balanced salts solution,
HBSS) started the color reaction that was stopped by further addition of 250-ll HBSS. Luminescence was analyzed at 510 nm (Victor X3, Perkin Elmer, USA).
Mitochondrial respiratory chain activity
For the isolation of mitochondria, mice were decapitated
after 60 min of ischemia (induced by MCAO) and brains
were removed quickly. The cerebellum was discarded,
and a section along the longitudinal ﬁssure separated
the two hemispheres. Mitochondria from the right
(healthy) and the left (ischemic) hemisphere were
isolated separately. Sham-operated mice were
anesthetized but did not undergo MCAO surgery. The
hemispheres were homogenized with a Potter S
Homogenizer (Sartorius BBI System, Göttingen,
Germany) in 2-ml mitochondrial respiration medium
(‘‘MiR05’’) enriched with protease inhibitor (Lassnig
et al., 2011). Mitochondria were isolated from the homogenates by multiple centrifugation steps (Lassnig et al.,
2011). Eighty microliter of the mitochondrial suspension
and 2-ml MiR05 medium were injected into a chamber
of the OroborosÒ Oxygraph-2k (Oroboros Instruments,
Innsbruck, Austria). The two chambers of the oxygraph
allowed simultaneous measurement of oxygen ﬂux in
two hemispheres. Activity of mitochondrial respiration
was determined by injecting several substrates and inhibitors of the respiratory chain (elaborated by E. Gnaiger,
see Hand et al., 2010 and Eckert et al., 2012). First, complex I respiration was determined by adding pyruvate

(5 mM) and malate (2 mM) as substrates for complex I
and ADP (2 mM) as substrate for complex V. The
OXPHOS state represented full oxidative phosphorylation
after adding succinate (10 mM), a substrate for complex
II. Addition of cytochrome c (10 lM) served as quality
control, oxygen ﬂux increased only when mitochondria
were damaged during isolation. Experiments in which
oxygen ﬂux increased by more than 10% after addition
of cytochrome c were discarded. Leak state was reached
with addition of oligomycin (2 lg/ml), inhibiting complex V
(not relevant in this study). The electron transfer
system (ETS) was reﬂected after injection of the
uncoupler carbonylcyanid-p-triﬂuoromethoxyphenylhydra
zon (FCCP, 1.5 lM). Complex II respiration was determined indirectly by adding rotenone (0.5 lM), a speciﬁc
complex I inhibitor. Antimycin A inhibited physiological
respiration by blocking complex III, remaining residual
oxygen consumption (ROX) was subtracted from all measured data. Maximum complex IV respiration was measured by addition of tetramethyl-phenylenediamine
(TMPD) as electron donor. For re-oxygenation, chambers
were opened for approximately 10 min two times
during the procedure. At the end of the procedure, the
amount of mitochondrial protein was determined by
the Lowry procedure and used to normalize oxygen
consumption data.

RESULTS
Eﬀect of triheptanoin diet on body weight and oddnumbered fatty acids
The present study compares two groups of mice which
received the same diet for 14 days, except that in one
case (control group), 35% of the calories were supplied
as soybean oil whereas in the other group (triheptanoin
group), 35% of the calories were supplied as
triheptanoin, an oil with odd-chain fatty acids and
anaplerotic properties. Body weights of the mice did not
diﬀer between control and triheptanoin-fed mice during
the 14-day dietary period (data not shown); at the end
of the diet, average body weights were 30.8 ± 2.4 g
(soybean diet) and 29.6 ± 2.2 g (triheptanoin diet),
respectively (mean ± S.D.; N = 9 each).

acids (Fig. 2A). In triheptanoin-fed mice, plasma
concentrations of heptanoate, pentanoate (valerate) and
propionate were 15.5 ± 5.5 lM, 7.6 ± 2.3 lM and
5.8 ± 1.5 lM (mean ± S.D.; N = 6), respectively,
and odd-numbered fatty acids were also measurable in
brain homogenates (Fig. 2B). None of these fatty acids
were detected in the blood or brain of mice fed control
(soybean oil) diet.
Stroke severity and behavioral testing
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, brain slices were
obtained and stained with TTC (Fig. 3A). Striatal slices
of stroked mice on control diet (Fig. 3A, middle panel)
showed a clearly marked white necrotic area in the left
hemisphere, with the core of the stroke in the striatum.
Pre-treatment with triheptanoin (Fig. 3A, lower panel)
reduced the infarct area and led to a pink-reddish
staining, which resembled sham-operated animals

artery occlusion (MCAO). Brain slices were stained with 2,3,5triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC). Healthy tissue is colored red,

legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

(Fig. 3A, upper panel). Infarct areas in striatal slices
were 12.56 ± 1.28 mm2 in mice on control diet,
compared to 5.23 ± 0.66 mm2 in triheptanoin-fed mice
(Fig. 3B). This corresponds to a reduction of 60%
(p < 0.001). Infarct volumes were also calculated,
however, due to the short time of ischemia, infarct
volumes
in
triheptanoin-fed
mice
were
only
10.00 ± 3.58 mm3 because few slices showed clear-cut
ischemia at all. For comparison, the infarct volumes in
controls were 48.43 ± 17.23 mm3.
Results from the neurological testing procedures are
displayed in Fig. 4. All experiments were carried out
before as well as 24 h after transient MCAO. In the
Chimney test (Fig. 4A), MCAO reduced the ability of the
mice to exit a tube backward (from 10 to 18 s on
average after 1 day). Dietary treatment with triheptanoin
improved exit time to about 6 s (p < 0.01, Mann
Whitney test). In the Rotarod test (Fig. 4B), MCAO
impaired the ability of mice from the control diet group

T. M. Schwarzkopf et al. / Neuroscience 300 (2015) 201–209

to stay on the rotating rod after MCAO, from 120 to 70 s
on average. The triheptanoin-rich diet fully preserved
the ability of the mice on the Rotarod apparatus. In the
Corner test (Fig. 4C), stroked mice preferred the left
side to leave the corner, a behavior that is due to
muscle weakness and/or paralysis of the right limbs
after left-sided MCAO. Treatment with triheptanoin
strongly reduced this preference, indicating preserved
neurological function in the right limbs. Accordingly, the

laterality index was 0.98 vs. 0.29 in control and
triheptanoin mice, respectively, 24 h after MCAO. In
spite of considerable variability, this eﬀect was highly
signiﬁcant (p < 0.01).
Extracellular levels of glucose and glutamate
Fig. 5 shows extracellular concentrations of glucose and
glutamate, measured by microdialysis in mouse striatum
before, during and after 60 min of ischemia. At the onset
of MCAO, glucose levels in the control group dropped
immediately from 0.20 ± 0.09 mM (mean ± S.D.,
N = 8) to less than 10% of basal levels (detection limit:
0.02 mM). In triheptanoin-fed rats, glucose levels in the
microdialysates were higher at 0.27 ± 0.08 mM but
dropped equally strong upon onset of ischemia
(Fig. 5A). During reperfusion, glucose levels quickly
recovered and reached basal levels within 30 min.

experiments. ***p < 0.001 (two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni posttest, GraphPad Prism(R)).

Glutamate concentrations, in contrast, low under
basal conditions (6.3 ± 3.7 lM; Fig. 5B) but rose
extensively to more than 10-fold of baseline levels in
the control group (to 71.6 ± 25.5 lM). Glutamate
levels also recovered rapidly when transient MCAO
was terminated, even when blood ﬂow during
reperfusion reached only 25–30% of pre-ischemic

values (not illustrated). Importantly, in mice which
received the triheptanoin-enriched diet, glutamate
levels were similar to the control group before
ischemia (6.8 ± 3.9 lM), but the ischemia-induced rise
of glutamate was signiﬁcantly attenuated and reached
only 28.5 ± 12.6 lM (419% of baseline level;
p < 0.001 vs. controls).

cells of sham-operated mice (‘‘in vitro’’). After MCAO, the two
hemispheres were analyzed separately: the left, ischemic hemisphere (‘‘ex vivo ischemic hemisphere’’) and the right, non-ischemic
hemisphere (‘‘ex vivo healthy hemisphere’’). ATP content and MMP
of the triheptanoin-fed group diet is compared to the control group fed
a soybean oil-based diet. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of

compared to that of mice sustaining MCAO for 60 min. By analyzing
the two hemispheres separately, the left, ischemic hemisphere
(‘‘ex vivo ischemic hemisphere’’) and the contralateral, non-ischemic
hemisphere (‘‘ex vivo healthy hemisphere’’) could be compared. The
respiratory activity of the triheptanoin-fed group is compared to the
control group fed soybean oil. Data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of

T. M. Schwarzkopf et al. / Neuroscience 300 (2015) 201–209

ATP and MMP levels
ATP levels and MMPs were measured ex vivo to
determine the energy state of the brain (Fig. 6). In
control animals, 60 min of ischemia caused a reduction
of ATP content (Fig. 6A) and MMP (Fig. 6B). Dietary
treatment with triheptanoin before MCAO preserved
both, ATP levels and MMP, in brain homogenate
(p < 0.05 vs. group on control diet).
Mitochondrial respiratory chain activity
The activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain
complexes were measured using a Clark-type electrode
(see Experimental procedures). The activities of
complexes II and IV are illustrated in Fig. 7. Nonischemic mitochondria from sham-operated mice
(‘‘in vitro’’) are compared with mitochondria from mice
that sustained transient MCAO (‘‘ex vivo’’). By
separating the hemispheres before isolation of
mitochondria, ‘‘ex vivo ischemic’’ mitochondria from the
left (‘‘ischemic’’) hemisphere could be analyzed
separately from ‘‘ex vivo healthy’’ mitochondria from the
right (‘‘healthy’’) hemisphere. The data show that 60 min
of transient ischemia caused a decrease of O2consumption in mitochondria from stroked mice (control
group) in all measured respiratory states: Leak,
OXPHOS, complex I, II, IV, and ETS (only data for
complexes II and IV are shown in Fig. 7). In
mitochondria that were isolated from triheptanoin-treated
mice, O2-consumption was maintained after ischemia in
complexes II and IV. In complex II, a signiﬁcant
improvement of mitochondrial respiration by the
triheptanoin-rich diet was detected in the ischemic
hemisphere (Fig. 7, upper panel). Complex IV activities
were signiﬁcantly increased by triheptanoin in both
‘‘ex vivo’’ experiments (healthy and ischemic
hemisphere) (Fig. 7, lower panel).

DISCUSSION
Triheptanoin is a promising therapeutic compound for a
variety of diseases, including inherited conditions such
as glucose transporter I-deﬁciency (Marin-Valencia
et al., 2013) and certain subtypes of epilepsy (Willis
et al., 2010; Borges and Sonnewald, 2012). Using a similar diet as Willis et al. (2010), we here report a proof-ofprinciple study in an experimental stroke model in mice
that triheptanoin may be of value in the prevention of
ischemia-related damage in the brain. The triheptanoinenriched diet which was fed over 14 days was well tolerated by mice. Body weights and behavior of mice were
unchanged when compared to the control group fed a
soybean oil-based diet. Triheptanoin-fed mice had measurable concentrations of odd-numbered fatty acids (propionic, pentanoic and heptanoic acid) in the plasma and in
brain (Fig. 2) whereas odd-numbered fatty acids were not
detectable in the plasma and brain of soybean oil-fed
mice. Transient brain ischemia by a 60-min MCAO
caused a variety of pathological outcomes, most of which
were less severe in triheptanoin-fed mice than in the control group. Thus, infarct areas (Fig. 3) and neurological

function (Fig. 4) were signiﬁcantly reduced in those mice
which were fed a triheptanoin-rich diet, compared to controls fed a soybean oil-based diet.
The mechanism of action of triheptanoińs beneﬁcial
eﬀects is not fully known (Borges and Sonnewald, 2012;
Marin-Valencia et al., 2013), but heptanoate, the major
metabolite of triheptanoin, is metabolized to two molecules of acetyl-CoA and one molecule of propionyl-CoA.
The latter compound is carboxylated to methylmalonylCoA, rearranged to succinyl-CoA, and can be used as a
substrate in complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Fig. 1). Alternatively, succinate can enter the
Krebs cycle as an anaplerotic substrate (Borges and
Sonnewald, 2012). In brain ischemia, loss of substrates
from the Krebs cycle is likely because large amounts of
glutamate are released, and glutamate synthesis depletes
stores of alpha-ketoglutarate, an intermediate of the
Krebs cycle. The formation and release of large amounts
of glutamate is illustrated in Fig. 5 which shows that extracellular glutamate levels increase by more than 10-fold
during ischemia. Remarkably, in mice fed the
triheptanoin-rich diet, glutamate levels increase only
threefold. This eﬀect is likely due to a preservation of
the cellular energy pool of ATP, because release of glutamate in ischemic cells is mainly due to the reversal of the
sodium-dependent glutamate transporter located at the
cell membrane (Danbolt, 2001). Loss of ATP causes inhibition of Na,K-ATPase, increase of intracellular sodium,
and reversal of the glutamate transporter (Lipton, 1999;
Danbolt, 2001). It is likely from this result that triheptanoin
diet improved the cellular energy status of brain cells, evidently restoring ATP production by an anaplerotic mechanism. It should be noted that triheptanoin did not aﬀect
the drop of glucose levels during ischemia which indicates
that cerebral blood ﬂow was not aﬀected by triheptanoin
and was similarly reduced in both dietary groups during
MCAO. Interestingly, glucose levels were somewhat
higher in the triheptanoin-fed group under basal conditions (Fig. 6B) which may indicate the use of alternative
fuels by neurons.
It should be noted that the triheptanoin-rich diet most
likely also caused the formation of ketone bodies such
as ß-hydroxybutyrate or ß-hydroxypentanoate, which
enter the brain via monocarboxylate transporters and
serve as energy substrates, e.g., under conditions of
low glucose. While we did not measure ketone bodies in
our study, we think that a distinctive role for ketone
bodies in triheptanoińs beneﬁcial actions is unlikely
because ketone bodies should also have been formed
in large amounts in the fat-rich, soybean oil-based
control diet.
To monitor energy failure after ischemia, we directly
measured ATP content in dissociated brain cells and
found it to be reduced in the ischemic hemisphere
(Fig. 6A). The triheptanoin-rich diet preserved ATP
levels during 60 min of ischemia and also preserved
MMPs (Fig. 6B). These ﬁndings strongly implicated
mitochondrial energy production as the target of
triheptanoińs beneﬁcial actions. We therefore proceeded

oxygen consumption of complexes I–IV (complex
II = succinate dehydrogenase). Mitochondria were
freshly isolated from mice which sustained transient
MCAO 1 h before. Short-term ischemia caused a
signiﬁcant decrease in respiratory activity, measured as
oxygen consumption, with signiﬁcant eﬀects in most
complexes (Canevari et al., 1997; Janssens et al., 2000;
Schwarzkopf et al., 2013). Pre-treatment with triheptanoin
14 days before onset of stroke maintained oxygen consumption in complex II and IV (Fig. 7); interestingly, the
contralateral hemisphere also seemed to suﬀer from
ischemia, and the triheptanoin-enriched diet stabilized
mitochondrial respiration in both hemispheres.

CONCLUSION
The present study clearly demonstrates that a
triheptanoin-rich diet inﬂuences brain energy metabolism
in a way that makes the brain more resistant to shortterm (60 min) ischemia. The most likely interpretation of
our ﬁndings is that the availability of triheptanoin, and
the metabolites formed thereof, causes an adaptation of
the mitochondrial energy production. While the braińs
metabolic responses to anaplerotic diet are not fully
known (Borges and Sonnewald, 2012; Marin-Valencia
et al., 2013), our data indicate that metabolites formed
from triheptanoin, such as succinyl-CoA and succinate,
may increase the respiratory activities of the electron
transport chain. Upon ischemia, the availability of anaplerotic substrates, together with increased activities of
complexes II and IV, preserve mitochondrial energy production and reduce ischemia-induced energy failure leading to increased ATP levels, reduced glutamate release,
and reduced brain damage. As dietary triheptanoin is well
tolerated, it may be useful as a preventive medication for
patients at risk for stroke.
