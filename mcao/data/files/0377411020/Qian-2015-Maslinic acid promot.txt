Maslinic acid, a natural pentacyclic triterpene from Olea europaea plants, possesses neuroprotective effects both in vivo and in vitro. However, the mechanism of its action is not well understood. In this study,
we investigated the potential effects of maslinic acid on synaptogenesis and axonal regeneration, as well
as the possible signal pathway involved in a cerebral ischemia mouse model. Adult male C57BL/6J mice
were subjected to 1 h of cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Maslinic acid (0.1,
1 and 10 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically 24 h after MCAO once daily for 7 consecutive days.
Axonal loss and synaptophysin expression in the ischemic boundary area was evaluated by histological
assay. The Akt/GSK-3β signal pathway was determined by western blot analysis. Two Akt inhibitors,
LY294002 and MK2206, were used to verify the involvement of Akt/GSK-3β pathway in maslinic acidmediated neuroprotection. Maslinic acid signiﬁcantly prevented axonal damage, promoted axonal regeneration and increased synaptophysin expression 7 days after ischemia. In addition, maslinic acid
treatment was shown to enhance Akt activity and promote GSK-3β phorsphorylation in stoke mice. The
increased neurite outgrowth and synaptophysin expression by maslinic acid treatment was blocked by
the Akt inhibitors both in vivo and in vitro.. These ﬁndings suggested that maslinic acid promotes synaptogenesis and axonal regeneration by regulating Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway, which may, in turn,
provide neuroprotection.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality with limited therapeutic possibilities. Axonal
remodeling and dendritic plasticity is critical to nerve regeneration and brain repair in the injured area after stroke (Ueno et al.,
2012), but the functional recovery after cerebral ischemia is extremely limited (Walmsley and Mir, 2007). Failure in axonal regeneration and synaptic plasticity may be partly attributed to the
nonpermissive environment and reduced intrinsic growth capacity
after CNS injuries, including the suppression of axonal extension
via chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, the inhibition of axonal regeneration by myelin components, and lack of neurotrophic factors and axon guidance molecules (Dill et al., 2008). Currently,
strategies targeting multiple factors for axonal regeneration or

enhancement of synaptic plasticity are considered as effective
therapies for CNS axonal injuries, however, remain unsatisfactory
(Galtrey and Fawcett, 2007; Liu et al., 2008; Walmsley and Mir,
2007).Maslinic acid (Fig. 1A), a natural pentacyclic triterpene derived from Olea europaea, elicits multiple bioactivities. Our previous studies have demonstrated that maslinic acid afford neuroprotection against oxygen–glucose deprivation-induced neuron
damage via modulation of anti-apoptotic signaling pathways (Qian
et al., 2011). Maslinic acid also exhibited protection against neuroinﬂammation by inhibiting NF-κB signal transducer pathway in
cultured cortical astrocytes (Huang et al., 2011). Moreover, maslinic acid has been implicated in ischemic stroke in animal models.
Maslinic acid administration controls hyperglycemia and prevents
the exacerbation of brain lesion, along with reduced NF-κB transcriptional activity (Guan et al., 2011). Nevertheless, whether
maslinic acid could prevent infarction or only delay it after cerebral ischemia, and the possible signal pathways involved in maslinic acid-mediated neuroprotection remain unclear. In the

treated with vehicle (Vehicle), MCAO group treated with lithium
chloride (LiCl, as the positive control) (Chuang et al., 2011; Xie
et al., 2014), and MCAO groups treated with 0.1 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg,
and 10 mg/kg of maslinic acid. Stroke was induced by MCAO as
previously described, with some modiﬁcations (Belayev et al.,
1999). Mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg
intraperitoneally) (Gauillard et al., 2002; Ozden and Isenmann,
2004). Under an operating microscope, the right common carotid
artery (CCA), external carotid artery (ECA), and internal carotid
artery (ICA) were exposed through a ventral midline incision. A
6-0 monoﬁlament nylon suture, coated with silicon hardener
mixture, was introduced into the ECA lumen and gently advanced
10 mm from the bifurcation of the CCA to occlude the MCA. Relative cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) was measured using a laser
Doppler ﬂowmetry (Moor Instruments Ltd, UK). Blood ﬂow was
observed to drop to o30% of the baseline and remained at that
level throughout the occlusion period. Mice whose rCBF remained
Z30% of baseline were excluded from the experiment. After 1 h of
occlusion, MCA blood ﬂow was restored by withdrawal of the
suture. The rectal temperature was monitored and kept at
37.0 70.5 °C with a thermostatically controlled heating pad. The
left femoral artery was catheterized for continuous arterial blood
gas monitoring to ensure the physiological conditions were the
same in the vehicle- and drug-treated animals at baseline. Sham
mice underwent a similar procedure, with the omission of MCAO.
Lithium chloride (5 mmol/kg), maslinic acid (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg)
or vehicle was administered intragastrically starting at 24 h after
reperfusion, once daily, for 7 consecutive days. At the end of day 7
(24 h after drug administration), the mice were killed for histological analysis and western blot assay (Fig. 1B).

2. Materials and methods

2.3. Intracerebroventricular administration of LY294002

2.1. Materials

Mice were randomly divided into four groups: sham-operation
group (Sham), MCAO group treated with vehicle (Vehicle), MCAO
group treated with maslinic acid (MA), and MCAO group treated
with
maslinic
acid
and
LY294002
(MA þLY).
Intracerebroventricular administration of LY294002 into the left
lateral ventricle was performed after 24 h of ischemia, as previously described (Shimamura et al., 2013). Mice were placed in
the stereotaxic apparatus under anesthesia and a burr-hole was
drilled in the skull (anteroposterior 1.5 mm, lateral 1.0 mm from
bregma, depth 2.5 mm). LY294002 (2 μL of 25 μM in 25% DMSO in
PBS) or vehicle was intracerebroventricularly injected into the left
lateral ventricle via the hole. Maslinic acid (10 mg/kg) or vehicle
was administered intragastrically starting at 24 h after reperfusion
once daily. The histological analysis and western blot assay were
evaluated at 72 h after ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Maslinic acid (96.5% purity, No. 0060324) was supplied by
Center for Drug Discovery, China Pharmaceutical University. The
compound was suspended in 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (W/V in normal saline, for animal administration) or dissolved
in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 0.5%, ﬁnal concentration, for cell
culture treatment). The MAP-2 antibody was purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); the synaptophysin, Akt and
phospho-Akt antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); the GSK-3β and phospho-GSK-3β
(ser9) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., (Cell
Signaling, Danvers, MA), and the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody was obtained from Kangchen BioTech (Shanghai, China). MK2206 was obtained from Biovision
(Milpitas, CA). Lithium chloride (LiCl) and LY294002 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
2.2. Animal treatment and middle cerebral artery occlusion
All experiment protocols were approved by the ethics committee of China Pharmaceutical University. Animal experiments
were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Adult
male C57/BL6J mice (24–28 g) were supplied by the Experimental
Animal Center of China Pharmaceutical University. Mice were
housed in a temperature-controlled environment (18–22 °C) with
a 12 h light-dark cycle and allowed free access to food and water
before the experiment. N ¼8 group sizes were used. All efforts
were made to minimize animal suffering and reduce the number
of animals used.
Mice were randomly divided into six groups: sham-operation
group (Sham), middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group

2.4. Primary neuron cultures
Cerebral cortical neurons were prepared as previously described (Xiong et al., 2004), with some modiﬁcations. In brief,
cortices were dissected from embryonic day 18 (E18) SpragueDawley rat embryos and incubated with 0.05% EDTA-trypsin then
passed through a nylon sieve (80 μm pore size) into Minimum
Essential Medium (MEM) supplemented with glucose (0.6% wt/
vol), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and 10%
(vol/vol) horse serum. The cells were adjusted to approximately
1  109/L and planted into 6-well plates, which were pre-coated
with 10 mg/L poly-L-lysine, at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2
and 95% O2. After 4 h, the medium was removed, and neurons
were maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 0.02%
B-27 and L-glutamine (0.5 mM). Under these conditions, the cultures typically contained more than 95% neurons as assessed by
MAP2-speciﬁc immunocytochemical detection.

2.5. Oxygen–glucose deprivation and cell culture treatment
Primary neurons were exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation
as previously described (Xiong et al., 2004), with some modiﬁcations. The regular Neurobasal culture medium was replaced by
glucose-free Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS, pH 7.4) bubbled
with 95% N2 and 5% CO2. The cells were then placed in an anaerobic chamber containing a mixture of 95% N2 and 5% CO2 humidiﬁed at 37 °C for 60 min. Oxygen–glucose deprivation was terminated by replacing the anoxic medium with Neurobasal medium, and returning to normoxia for an additional 24 h. Maslinic
acid (10 μM), or maslinic acid combination with MK2206 (0.2 μM),
was added into the cultures 1 h before, during the period of oxygen–glucose deprivation and 24 h of reoxygenation. Control cultures were treated in an identical way without inducing oxygen–
glucose deprivation.
2.6. Immunohistochemistry
Mice were anesthetized and perfused with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, 7 days after MCAO. The brains
were cut into 4-μm-thick coronal slices. After dewaxing, rehydration, and microwave irradiation, tissue sections were blocked by
10% normal goat serum for 10 min. Sections were incubated with
primary antibody for 15 min at 37 °C, then incubated with HRPconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and developed with diaminobenzidne (DAB). To determine the speciﬁc binding, the primary
antibody was omitted for negative control. Cell nuclei were
counterstained with hematoxylin (blue). Regions of interest (ROI,
the ventrolateral neocortex, the penumbra zone in the MCAO
model) were selected and digitized using a Leica Microscope. The
results were collected from three sections, with each section
containing three different ﬁelds. Data were averaged to obtain a
single value for one animal and were presented as the percentage
of positive area for synaptophysin immunoreactive cells by ImageJ
software (n ¼8 per group).

using the ImageJ software. Data were collected from three independent experiments performed in three wells per condition.
The total length of 20 neurons was averaged to obtain a single
value in each well (n¼ 9 per group).
2.9. Western blot
Protein samples from cerebral cortex were homogenized using
RIPA lysis buffer. Equal amounts of protein per sample were loaded
in each lane and separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in Tris–glycine buffer (48 mM Tris, 39 mM
glycine, pH 9.2) containing 20% methanol. The membranes were
blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 1 h, washed in Tris buffered
saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST), and incubated with the
primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing in TBST for
three times, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated for 1 h
at room temperature with the horseradish peroxidase conjugated
goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG. The protein bands detected by
the antibodies were visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico
Chemiluminescent Substrate Trial Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Images were taken using the ChemiDoc XRS system with Quantity
One software (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA). The results were from
three independent experiments performed in triplicate (n ¼9 per
group).
2.10. Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were represented as mean 7SD of at least
three independent preparations. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA analysis followed by a Tukey posthoc test. A difference with Po 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. Physiological variables

2.7. Bielschowsky silver staining
Axonal loss in the ischemic region was showed using Bielschowsky silver staining (Sevier and Munger, 1965). Brain sections
were mounted and deparafﬁnized to distilled water. Then the
slides were placed in a 20% silver nitrate solution in a water bath
(65 °C) and leave in for 15 min. After rinsing, an ammoniacal silver
mixture was added over the slides to develop the stain until
golden brown. The sections were then washed with water followed by sodium thiosulfate, washed again, and then dehydrated
and mounted. Axons were quantiﬁed by counting the retraction
balls or densely stained neurons in the sections. The results were
collected from three sections, with each section containing three
different ﬁelds. Data were averaged to obtain a single value for one
animal (n¼ 8 per group). The calculation of axonal density is based
on pixel count using ImageJ software.
2.8. Immunocytochemistry
Cultured neurons were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) for three times, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min
at room temperature and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for
10 min. An incubation in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h
was performed to prevent non-speciﬁc binding. The cultures were
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by
incubation with Cy3 or FITC-conjugated IgG. Immunostained cells
were examined under a ﬂuorescence microscope (Olympus IX71,
Tokyo, Japan). The digital images were obtained using Image-Pro
Plus software. The total dendrite length was measured in each well

The major physiologic variables of mice in each group were
measured 10 min before MCAO, 60 min after MCAO, and 60 min
after reperfusion, respectively. All animals showed similar values
for rectal temperature, mean arterial blood pressure, arterial blood
gases, and blood glucose. The laser Doppler ﬂowmetry signal
showed no signiﬁcant differences among groups before surgery.
MCAO induced an approximately 75% drop in rCBF after MCAO
compared with the sham-operated group. After the 60-min of
reperfusion, the rCBF value returned to the baseline, with no signiﬁcant differences in each group (data not shown).
3.2. Maslinic acid treatment decreases axonal damage and increases
synaptophysin expression in stroke mice
Mice were killed 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion injury. The
brain coronal sections in the cortex were prepared for histological
assay. Bielschowsky Silver staining showed that the axon in the
sham group was clear and evenly thick, with intact continuity.
While in the vehicle-treated group, the number of axons around
MCA area decreased signiﬁcantly. Axonal injuries were found, with
swelling, fragmentation and breakages. LiCl, the positive control,
and maslinic acid (1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) administration exhibited remarkable restoration of axonal loss at 7 days after stroke.
Neuron degeneration did not alter signiﬁcantly in 0.1 mg/kg maslinic acid-treated mice, compared with that in the vehicle group
(Fig. 2A). The quantitative results showed that the axonal density
increased to 1.3 and 2.2 folds in the 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg maslinic acid-treated groups respectively (Po 0.05 and P o0.01

compared with the vehicle group, Fig. 2B).
Synaptophysin (SYN) is one of the proteins known to be involved in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity, so we measured
the distribution and the expression level of synaptophysin after
focal cerebral ischemia. Fig. 3 shows a set of typical micrographs of
synaptophysin immunostained section from the cortical regions.
As expected, stroke induced a sharp drop of synaptophysin levels
in the MCA coronal sections, compared with that in the sham
group (P o0.01). However, maslinic acid (10 mg/kg) treatment
signiﬁcantly reversed this depletion at 7 days post MCAO (Po 0.05
compared with the vehicle group, Fig. 3). The result was further
conformed by western blot assay. Maslinic acid (10 mg/kg) treatment signiﬁcantly elevated synaptophysin expression after ischemic insult (P o0.05, Fig. 4). These data suggested the efﬁcacy of
maslinic acid for axon growth and synaptogenesis in response to
focal stroke.
3.3. Maslinic acid treatment promotes Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway in the ischemic brain
Because the activation of Akt is implicated in the regulation of
synaptic plasticity, we further investigated the effects of maslinic
acid on Akt activation. MCAO induced slight activation of Akt, as
evaluated by phosphorylation of Ser473-Akt, increasing to about
1.6 fold compared with the sham group. Maslinic acid (10 mg/kg)
further increased the phosphorylation of Akt in the ischemic brain
(P o0.01 compared with the vehicle group, Fig. 5A and C),

indicating that maslinic acid treatment promotes Akt activity in
the ischemic brain.
To determine whether GSK-3β, the downstream signaling of
Akt, is involved in maslinic acid-mediated axonal regeneration and
synaptogenesis after stroke, the phosphorylation of Ser9-GSK-3β,
the inactive form of GSK-3β was determined. Western blot analysis
showed that, the total GSK-3β levels did not alter after MCAO or
drug treatment, while phospho-GSK-3β expression increased in
stroke mice compared with the sham group. Maslinic acid (1 mg/
kg and 10 mg/kg) treatment caused profound elevation of GSK-3β
phosphorylation, approximately 1.3 and 1.7 folds compared with
the vehicle-treated group, respectively (Fig. 5B and D). These results suggested that maslinic acid effectively prevents GSK-3β activation in ischemic stroke.
3.4. Maslinic acid increases neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis
via regulation of Akt signaling
In order to verify the involvement of Akt pathway in the protective efﬁcacy of maslinic acid, the Akt inhibitor LY294002 was
administrated to mice combined with maslinic acid. Compared
with maslinic acid-treated group, the combination treatment signiﬁcantly reduced the number of axons (Fig. 5 A and B), and downregulated SYN levels (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the activation of Akt/GSK3β pathways induced by maslinic acid was also blocked by
LY294002 treatment (Fig. 5D and E).We further applied the Aktspeciﬁc inhibitor, MK2206, in the oxygen–glucose deprivation

the vesicles. Maslinic acid effectively prevented OGD-induced
down-regulation of synaptophysin. Similarly, MK2206 blocked the
effects of maslinic acid on synaptophysin expression in hypoxic
neurons (Fig. 6A and C). Both in vivo and in vitro data suggested
that the effects of maslinic acid on neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis might be related with regulation of Akt signaling.

(OGD) model of neurons. Immunostaining was performed to observe neurite outgrowth and synaptophysin expression. We found
that maslinic acid treatment signiﬁcantly improved neurite outgrowth after OGD insult by using MAP2, the speciﬁc marker of
neurons. However, MK2206 attenuated maslinic acid-mediated
neurite outgrowth (Fig. 6A and B). In neuron cultures, synaptophysin is expressed in axon, dendrites and particularly carrying in

Emerging evidence have shown various biological activities of
maslinic acid such as anti-oxidative and anti-inﬂammatory effects,
the capability of lowering blood glucose levels, and protection
against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity (Lozano-Mena et al.,
2014). In our previous work, pretreatment with 5 mg/kg maslinic
acid signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volumes and improved neurological scores in rat MCAO models (Guan et al., 2011). Moreover, it
has been reported that after the administration of 50 mg/kg maslinic acid, serum levels reached 3 μM at 10 min and was detected
in plasma at 60 min (Brazil et al., 2004). Measurement of plasmatic
concentrations of 10 mg/kg maslinic acid gave a value of
10.8 7 2.2 nM at 24 h post-administration (Sanchez-Gonzalez
et al., 2013). Therefore, we set 10 mg/kg as the high dose, which is
converted from the intake of maslinic acid in rats. And we chose
1 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg as middle and low doses to observe dosedependent response. Here we investigated if delayed treatment of
maslinic acid improved functional recovery following acute cerebral ischemia. The results show that maslinic acid produces a
signiﬁcant improvement in functional neurologic recovery after
focal cerebral ischemia. Maslinic acid treatment signiﬁcantly increases axonal density and synaptophysin levels in the ischemic
brain. Maslinic acid treatment is capable to enhance Akt activity
and promote GSK-3β phorsphorylation in stoke mice. In addition,
we demonstrate that the beneﬁcial effects of maslinic acid treatment can be blocked by the Akt inhibitors. Both in vivo and in vitro
data support the therapeutic potential of maslinic acid for restoring neurologic function post stroke.

Synaptophysin is a major calcium-binding protein speciﬁcally
located in the presynaptic vesicle membrane. Synaptophysin is
synthesized in the soma then transported to the axon terminals.
Synaptophysin plays pivotal roles in the formation of channels on
synaptic vesicles, the fusion of synaptic vesicles and the release of
neurotransmitter from vesicle membrane (Ujike et al., 2002). The
functional recovery after ischemic stroke is closely related with
changes in synaptophysin expression. Synaptic reconstruction
after ischemia signiﬁcantly increased its expression, which promotes axonal sprouting and new synapse formation, ultimately
contributes to neurologic functional improvement (Hou et al.,
2008). Therefore, the protein is an important symbol of synaptic
reconstruction and is widely used as a biomarker for functional
recovery after focal cerebral ischemia. In this study, Bielschowsky
silver, the marker for axons, was used to observe MCAO-induced
axonal damage. Synaptophysin expression was used to evaluate
synaptogenesis (Chen et al., 2010). We found that maslinic acid
treatment signiﬁcantly prevented axonal injury and increased synaptophysin expression in the ischemic brain, suggesting the efﬁcacy of maslinic acid for axonal regeneration and synaptogenesis
following stroke onset.
To elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying maslinic
acid-mediated synaptogenesis and axonal regeneration after
stroke, the activity of Akt/GSK-3β signaling pathway was evaluated. The serine/threonine-speciﬁc protein kinase Akt, also

known as protein kinase B (PKB), is an important factor involved in
multiple cellular processes such as cell growth, proliferation and
apoptosis (Brazil et al., 2004). Akt is a well-established neuronal
survival signal in response to ischemia. Changes in the phosphorylation of Akt were reported after cerebral ischemia induced
by MCAO. These reports showed that ischemia/reperfusion signiﬁcantly increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 (Gu et al.,
2013; Wu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2007), which was consistent
with our study. In addition, the activation of Akt by phosphorylation at Ser473 facilitates the process of synaptic plasticity in the
MCAO model (Chen et al., 2010),and is prone to promote axonal
outgrowth and motoneuronal survival (Namikawa et al., 2000;
Ransome and Turnley, 2008). Maslinic acid treatment further increased phospho-Akt level compared with the vehicle group,
suggesting that maslinic acid-mediated synaptogenesis and axon
growth may be through the Akt activation.
GSK-3, a serine/threonine protein kinase described as one of
the kinases in the regulation of glucose metabolism, is now considered to be involved in various physiological processes. Among
two highly homologous GSK-3 isoforms, GSK-3α and GSK-3β, GSK3β is abundant in CNS and is neuron speciﬁc (Kelly et al., 2004).
There is growing evidence that GSK-3β dysfunction has been
linked to the pathogenesis of acute and chronic neurodegenerative
diseases. There are several mechanisms by which GSK-3β participates in CNS diseases such as hyperphosphorylation of tau protein,

regulation of Aβ production, induction of neuron apoptosis and
function in synaptic plasticity (Caricasole et al., 2004; Cross et al.,
2001; Peineau et al., 2007; Su et al., 2004). Stroke or neurodegenerative diseases stimulate the activation of GSK-3β, which is
controlled by Tyr216 (the active form) and Ser9 (the inactive form)
phosphorylation. Selectively inhibition of GSK-3β may be neuroprotective (Guo et al., 2014; Kelly et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2011).
Recent studies reported that GSK-3β at Ser9 was increased in
MCAO model 3 or 5 days post ischemia (Guo et al., 2015; Luo et al.,
2014), while other reports showed that phosphorylation of GSK-3β
at Ser9 was decreased after ischemia/reperfusion (Chern et al.,
2014; Ma et al., 2014). One possible explanation for this discrepancy is the difference in ischemic time and the subregions
where samples were collected. Moreover, GSK-3β is a downstream
signal of Akt which promotes the phosphorylation at Ser9 thus
inactivates GSK-3β (Juhaszova et al., 2009).On these grounds, we
hypothesize that the neuroprotection elicited by maslinic acid may
be associated with the regulation of Akt/GSK-3β signal pathway.
Our data demonstrated that maslinic acid effectively enhances the
activity of Akt and inactivates GSK-3β. These results suggest that
activation of Akt/ GSK-3β signaling by maslinic acid may mediate
synaptogenesis and axon growth after cerebral ischemia.
Finally, we performed the in vivo and in vitro experiment to
verify if Akt activation is involved in the mechanism of axonal
outgrowth and synaptophysin expression provided by maslinic
acid treatment, by using the LY294002, a protein kinase inhibitor
of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in mice, as well as the Akt-speciﬁc
inhibitor MK2206 in neuron cultures (Liu et al., 2011). We showed
that LY294002 administration weakened maslinic acid-induced
axon regeneration and synaptophysin expression after experimental stroke, suggesting the involvement of Akt pathway in the
protective efﬁcacy of maslinic acid. In the MCAO model, ischemic

core expands over time. Cells in the penumbra eventually die due
to the development of the injury (Ashwal et al., 1998). Our in vivo
data provide evidences that with the treatment of maslinic acid,
neurons located in the border of the penumbra-like area that
surrounds the ischemic core develop tolerance. In in vitro experiments, lack of oxygen and glucose supply mimics the ischemic
core area in vivo and results in serious degeneration of neuronal
processes and cell death (Jiang et al., 2005). The pretreatment
protocol prevents hypoxic neuron from secondary damage and
mimics the effects in the penumbra. Pretreatment with MK2206
obviously attenuated the effects of maslinic acid on neurite outgrowth and synaptophysin expression in cultured cortical neurons.
These results further supported the role of maslinic acid in promoting synaptogenesis and neurite outgrowth, and conﬁrmed the
involvement of Akt pathway in maslinic acid’s action after cerebral
ischemia.
Collectively, the present data demonstrated that maslinic acid
obviously increases Akt/ GSK-3β pathways, which is associated
with promotion of synaptogenesis and axon growth post-stroke.
More effective endogenous stimulation of Akt/GSK-3β in the brain
may be new strategies for the treatment of stroke and other
neurodegenerative diseases. The precise mechanism by which
maslinic acid improves synaptogenesis and axon growth is not
entirely clear but warrants further investigation.
