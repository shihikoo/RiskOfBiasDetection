was signiﬁcantly ameliorated (21.5 ± 1.9%) compared with
the PBS group (25.6 ± 5.1%) when assessed at 7 weeks after
MCAO. The cell-treated group did not exhibit signiﬁcant differences from the PBS group in either rotarod (238 ± 46 s in

INTRODUCTION
Perinatal/neonatal stroke occurs in 1/2800 to 1/5000 live
births and results in life-long neurological impairments:
e.g., cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and epilepsy
(Nelson and Lynch, 2004; Chabrier et al., 2011). The
current treatment for infants with stroke is predominantly
supportive, as there is no evidence-based speciﬁc
treatment available (Roach et al., 2008; Chabrier et al.,
2011). The onset of neonatal stroke is antenatal in
some cases and is unknown in others. Hence,
treatments that have a narrow therapeutic window, such
as tissue plasminogen activator, are not feasible for
perinatal/neonatal stroke. Cell-based therapy has
attracted much attention as a novel treatment for a
number of neurological diseases, including neonatal
encephalopathy (NE) (Bennet et al., 2012), which
encompasses stroke and hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy
(HIE) (Dammann et al., 2011). Apart from its possible
regenerative properties, its wide therapeutic time window,
up to days after the insult (Yasuhara et al., 2010; Donega
et al., 2013), is one of the most attractive features of this
therapy. This is astonishing considering the fact that almost
all candidate drugs examined in animal models exhibit
neuroprotection only when administered before or within a
few hours after the insult.
Human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) contains many
stem cell types, i.e., hematopoietic stem cells,
endothelial progenitor cells, and mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) (Ingram et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2004).
CD34 is widely used as a marker of hematopoietic stem

Abstract—Neonatal stroke occurs in approximately 1/4000
live births and results in life-long neurological impairments:
e.g., cerebral palsy. Currently, there is no evidence-based
speciﬁc treatment for neonates with stroke. Several studies
have reported the beneﬁts of umbilical cord blood (UCB) cell
treatment in rodent models of neonatal brain injury. However, all of the studies examined the eﬀects of administering
either the UCB mononuclear cell fraction or UCB-derived
mesenchymal stem cells in neonatal rat models. The objective of this study was to examine the eﬀects of human UCB
CD34+ cells (hematopoietic stem cell/endothelial progenitor
cells) in a mouse model of neonatal stroke, which we
recently developed. On postnatal day 12, immunocompromized (SCID) mice underwent permanent occlusion of the left
middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Forty-eight hours after
MCAO, human UCB CD34+ cells (1  105 cells) were injected
intravenously into the mice. The area in which cerebral

and endothelial progenitor cells (Raﬁi and Lyden, 2003).
hUCB contains 10-times more CD34+ mononuclear cells
(MNCs) than does adult peripheral blood (Murohara
et al., 2000). The proportion of CD34+ cells in hUCB
ranges from 0.3% (Sun et al., 2010) to 2.4% (de Paula
et al., 2012), which is comparable to bone marrow (Cox
et al., 2011). Because of this feature, hUCB has been
used for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in
patients with hematological diseases and inherited
metabolic disorders/neurodegenerative diseases, i.e.,
Hurler’s syndrome, adrenoleukodystrophy, and Krabbe
disease (Prasad et al., 2008). Apart from their
hematopoietic properties, hUCB cells (hUCBCs) have
myriad eﬀects. Human CD34+ cells secrete numerous
cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, including
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Majka et al.,
2001). CD34+ cells are less prevalent in the neonatal
peripheral blood immediately after birth than in UCB and
tend to decrease within the ﬁrst 48 h after delivery (Kim
et al., 2007). The basic concept underlying the
intravenous administration of autologous UCBCs for NE
is to replenish the reduced stem cells in systemic
circulation, which may contribute to neuroprotection and/
or enhance cerebral plasticity.
There are several dozen reports in the literature that
have examined the eﬀects of cell therapies in animal
models of NE. Several cell types have been investigated
(Chicha et al., 2014), including neural stem cells (Comi
et al., 2008; Sato et al., 2008), MSCs (van Velthoven
et al., 2010), multipotent adult progenitor cells
(Yasuhara et al., 2006), and dental pulp-derived stem
cells (Yamagata et al., 2013). Several cell sources have
been investigated as well, i.e., rodent embryo (Comi
et al., 2008; Sato et al., 2008), rodent or human bone
marrow (Yasuhara et al., 2006; van Velthoven et al.,
2010), and hUCB (Meier et al., 2006). Furthermore,
several administration routes have also been
investigated, i.e., intracerebral (Xia et al., 2010),
intraperitoneal (Meier et al., 2006), and intranasal
delivery (van Velthoven et al., 2013). Many studies have
shown the beneﬁts of cell therapy. Among these
diﬀerent cell therapies, the intravenous administration of
autologous UCB treatment may have the lowest risk for
clinical use in NE (Bennet et al., 2012). A few clinical
trials using an intravenous administration of autologous
UCB for NE are currently in progress (http://
www.clinicaltrials.gov/, NCT00593242, NCT01506258,
NCT01649648). However, little is known about the
optimal protocol and the mechanisms of action of UCBC
treatment. To date, there have been 15 reports in the
literature examining the eﬀects of UCBC treatment in
rodent models of NE. These studies used either whole
of the MNC fraction (Meier et al., 2006; de Paula et al.,
2009, 2012; Pimentel-Coelho et al., 2010; Rosenkranz
et al., 2010, 2012, 2013; Yasuhara et al., 2010; Geißler
et al., 2011; Bae et al., 2012; Dalous et al., 2012;
Wasielewski et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013) or MSCs
derived from hUCB (Xia et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012).
The eﬀects of other cell populations in UCB for NE
remain unknown. In this study, we focused on the
CD34+ cell fraction of hUCB. We have previously

149

reported the beneﬁcial eﬀects of the systemic
administration of hUCB-CD34+ cells in an adult mouse
model of stroke (Taguchi et al., 2004a). The objective of
this study was to examine the eﬀects of the intravenous
administration of hUCB-CD34+ cells on post-stroke
recovery in a mouse model of neonatal stroke.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and surgery
All experiments were performed in accordance with the
NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and were approved by the Experimental Animal Care
and Use Committee of the National Cerebral and
Cardiovascular Center.
Ninety-one postnatal day 12 (P12) male and female
mouse pups with severe combined immunodeﬁciency
(SCID) (CB-17/lcr-scid/scidJcl; CLEA Japan Inc., Tokyo,
Japan) were prepared for the experiments. P8–12 mice
are considered comparable to human full-term (P0)
neonates with regard to brain maturation (Hagberg
et al., 2002); some authors argue that P12 mice are
more representative of human full-term neonates
(Charriaut-Marlangue et al., 2013). The novel model of
neonatal stroke that we recently reported (Tsuji et al.,
2013) uses CB-17 (CB-17/lcr-+/+Jcl) mouse pups,
which are immunocompetent. As human cells were
administered to mice, in the present study, we used
immunocompromized
animals
to
minimize
immunological reactions due to xenotransplantation. The
SCID mice used in the present study were derived from
the same strain with the same genetic background as
CB-17 mice. All eﬀorts were made to minimize the
number of animals used and their suﬀering.
Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
was produced according to previously reported methods
(Tsuji et al., 2013). Under isoﬂurane anesthesia (4.0%
for induction and 1.5–2.0% for maintenance), a hole
was made in the left temporal bone. The left middle
cerebral artery (MCA) was electrocauterized and
disconnected distal to crossing the olfactory tract.
Thirteen pups underwent open-skull surgery without
MCA electrocoagulation and served as sham-surgery
controls. Five pups were excluded from the
experimental analysis owing to bleeding during surgery.
All analyses were performed by investigators who were
blinded to the experimental group.
Cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) measurements
The cortical surface CBF was measured by a laser
speckle ﬂowmetry imaging system (Omegazone,
Omegawave Inc., Tokyo, Japan) 24 h after MCAO, 24 h
after treatment (i.e., 72 h after MCAO), and 1 and
7 weeks after treatment, as described previously, with
one minor modiﬁcation (Ohshima et al., 2012). We
measured the CBF in two regions of interest (ROIs)
through the intact skull with an open-scalp: the Core
(the ischemic core region of the MCA territory) and the
MCA region (the broader region covering most of the
MCA territory, including the Core). The same grid was

150

M. Tsuji et al. / Neuroscience 263 (2014) 148–158

used to set the two matching regions on the contralateral
side. To analyze the inﬂuence of the treatment on the
CBF in the peri-infarct regions, we measured the area in
which the CBF was not attenuated, which we deﬁned as
the ‘‘well-perfused area.’’ By observing the contralateral
CBF visually, the area in which the CBF appeared equal
to the corresponding contralateral side was manually
demarcated using NIH Image software (ImageJ, 1.43r,
NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). For analytical accuracy of
ROIs between animals and serial imaging, we set the
ROI based on a line drawn from bregma to lambda,
rather than basing it on the actual MCA-perfused
territory. The percent of the well-perfused area was
calculated by the ratio of the well-perfused area out of
an area of a square grid, which primarily covered the
MCA-perfused territory (Fig. 1A). All pups exhibited CBF
reduction in the MCA territory after the MCAO.
However, three mice exhibiting a mild CBF reduction,
which was deﬁned as a CBF ratio (ipsilateral/
contralateral MCA region) > 0.80 at 24 h after MCAO,
were removed from the study.
Administration of hUCB-CD34+ cells after stroke
Seventy mice with MCAO were randomly assigned to one
of two groups that received hUCB-CD34+ cells (UCBC
group) or phosphate-buﬀered saline (PBS group).
Human UCB-CD34+ cells were purchased from Lonza

Inc. (Walkersville, MD, USA). The purity was >95%,
and the viability of the cells was >95%. Forty-eight
hours after the stroke, a skin incision was made under
isoﬂurane anesthesia, and the left femoral vein was
exposed. hUCB-CD34+ cells (1  105 cells), or the
same volume (40 ll) of PBS, were carefully infused into
the femoral vein over 3 min using a 35G needle. We
selected the dose of 1  105 hUCB-CD34+ cells in the
present study as the dose of 5  105 cells was
beneﬁcial in our previous study in an adult mouse model
(Taguchi et al., 2004a). We selected the timing of cell
administration at 48 h after the insult on the basis of our
previous studies (Taguchi et al., 2004a; Uemura et al.,
2012).
Behavioral tests
Rotarod and open-ﬁeld tests were performed as
described previously (Tsuji et al., 2013). Sensorimotor
skills were evaluated 9 days and 7 weeks after the insult
in the rotarod test. The rotarod accelerated from 4 to
40 rpm over 5 min (Muromachi Kikai Co., Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan). The time until the mouse fell oﬀ the rotating
drum was recorded for ﬁve consecutive sessions, and
the average time spent on the drum was used for
statistical comparison.
Locomotor and exploratory behaviors were evaluated
5 and 7 weeks after the insult using the open-ﬁeld test.

artery occlusion (MCAO)). The CBF was decreased in the MCA region on the ipsilateral side, which is indicated by the bluish color, after the MCAO
insult. (C) There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the PBS-treated and human umbilical cord blood CD34+ cell (UCBC)-treated groups with
regard to CBF in the ischemic core. (D) However, with regard to the area of CBF reduction, there was a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the ratio of the area
in which CBF was maintained (the area delineated by white lines in A, B) out of an area of a square (the square delineated by white dotted lines).
The square was set based on a line drawn from bregma to lambda. We deﬁned the ratio as the ‘‘% well-perfused area.’’ Diﬀerences between groups
were tested using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA. A post hoc test showed that the% well-perfused area was signiﬁcantly larger in the UCBC
group compared with the PBS group at 24 h after the treatment. ⁄P < 0.05 (PBS-treated group n = 10–12 at each time point, except at 7 weeks
after treatment (n = 5); UCBC-treated group n = 11–13 at each time point, except at 7 weeks after treatment (n = 4)). Tx; treatment.

M. Tsuji et al. / Neuroscience 263 (2014) 148–158

Animals were allowed to search freely in a box
(30  30 cm) for 30 min in a light environment and for
the subsequent 30 min in a dark environment (Taiyo
Electric Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Infrared beams were
mounted at speciﬁc intervals on the X-, Y-, and Z-banks
of the open-ﬁeld. The total number of beam crossings
by the animal was counted and scored as ‘‘locomotion’’
for the horizontal movement and as ‘‘rearing’’ for the
vertical movement.
Histological analyses
A morphological evaluation of the brain injury was
performed as described previously (Tsuji et al., 2012,
2013). Animals were perfusion-ﬁxed intracardially with
4% paraformaldehyde at 12 days or 7 weeks after the
insult. The brain was removed and sectioned coronally in
1-mm-thick slices. The areas of the ipsilateral and
contralateral hemispheres in each brain section were
measured using ImageJ. The hemispheric volume was
estimated by integrating the hemispheric areas. The %
stroke volume was calculated as follows: ((contralateral
volume viable ipsilateral volume)/contralateral volume)
 100%. This model causes a pure cortical stroke with
mild secondary injury in the thalamus and the corpus
callosum, and the hemispheric volume eﬀectively
represents the histological injury (Tsuji et al., 2013).
Immunohistochemistry
Coronally sectioned brain slices were covered in tissue
freezing medium (O.C.T. Compound, Sakura Finetek
USA Inc., Torrance, CA, USA). Coronal sections
(10 lm) were prepared using a cryostat (Leica
Biosystems Inc., Wetzler, Germany). Sections were
subjected to immunohistochemistry with anti-human
nuclei antibody (HuNu) (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA,
USA, 1:30) and mouse-speciﬁc antibody to CD31
antigen expressed by endothelial cells (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA, 1:100); the secondary antibodies
included anti-mouse Envision+ system-HRP Labeled
Polymer and biotinylated anti-rat immunoglobulin (Dako
Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), respectively. Nuclei
were stained with hematoxylin after the HuNu staining.
When analyzing the CD31-positive blood vessel, we
deﬁned the ‘‘peri-infarct area’’ as the external (nonischemic) regions within 200 lm of the border of the
post-stroke area, as described previously (Nakano-Doi
et al., 2010). The lengths and diameters of blood
vessels were measured using ImageJ.

the Bonferroni test. Diﬀerences were considered
signiﬁcant at P < 0.05. The results are expressed as
the mean ± standard deviation (SD), unless otherwise
noted.

RESULTS
Mortality and body weight
Mortality rates did not diﬀer between the PBS and UCBC
groups: 1 out of 35 mice in the PBS group and 2 out of 35
mice in the UCBC group. Body weights at the time of
surgery (P12), and at 7 days (P21) and 7 weeks after
the treatment (P63), did not diﬀer among the three
groups, including the sham-surgery control group
(Table 1).

CBF
With regard to the degree of CBF reduction, there were no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the PBS and UCBC
groups, either in the ischemic core (Fig. 1A–C) or in the
MCA region (data not shown). However, with regard to
the area of CBF reduction, a two-way repeated
measures ANOVA showed that there was a signiﬁcant
group diﬀerence in the % well-perfused area: i.e., the
areas where CBF was maintained were diﬀerent
(Fig. 1A, B, and D). A post hoc test showed that the %
well-perfused area was signiﬁcantly larger in the UCBC
group compared with the PBS group at 24 h after the
treatment, but not at the other time points measured.

Morphological brain injury
All pups subjected to MCAO exhibited cortical infarct and
consistent hemispheric volume loss when assessed
either 12 days or 7 weeks after the insult (Fig. 2A, B).
Twelve days after MCAO, the mean % stroke volume did
not diﬀer between the PBS and UCBC groups,
20.7 ± 3.3% and 21.3 ± 2.4%, respectively (Fig. 2A).
Seven weeks after MCAO, the mean% stroke volume in
the UCBC group (21.5 ± 1.9%) was signiﬁcantly
ameliorated compared with the PBS group (25.6 ± 5.1%)
(Fig. 2B–D). No sex diﬀerences in % stroke volume were
observed in either of the groups (male 26.2 ± 3.9 vs.
female 24.8 ± 6.5% in the PBS group, male 21.4 ± 1.2
vs. female 21.5 ± 2.3% in the UCBC group, at 7 weeks
after MCAO).

Statistics
The mortality rate of the animals was analyzed using the
Fisher’s exact test. Diﬀerences in body weight were
assessed using a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), followed by the Bonferroni test. The percent
volume loss was assessed using a Student t-test. CBF,
rotarod and open-ﬁeld test outcomes were assessed
using a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, followed
by the Bonferroni test. Parameters in blood vessels
were assessed using a two-way ANOVA, followed by

Localization of hUCB-CD34+ cells
Very few donor cells stained with human antinuclear
antibody were identiﬁed in the brain (a few stained cells
per the entire coronal section) 24 h after the intravenous
injection (n = 5), most of which were located around
blood vessels (Fig. 3). The stained cells were hardly
identiﬁed 10 days after the injection (n = 5) (data not
shown).
Blood vessels
We analyzed blood vessels in the region bordering the
cortical infarct at 7 weeks after MCAO (Fig. 4A). There
were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in either the number of
vessels or the total length of vessels between the PBS
and UCBC groups (Fig. 4B–E). However, the mean
diameter of vessels was signiﬁcantly larger in the
UCBC-treated mice compared with the PBS-treated
mice (Fig. 4B, C, and F). These large vessels in the
UCBC-treated mice were observed only in the region
bordering the cortical infarct and not in the other regions
of the ipsilateral side or in the contralateral side.
Rotarod performance

treadmill at 9 days and 6 weeks after the insult, was

vs. female 155 ± 61 s in the PBS group, male 185 ±

6 weeks).

Open-ﬁeld activities
We initially analyzed the overall activities during 60-min
sessions at 5 and 7 weeks after the insult using a
two-way repeated measures ANOVA (data not shown).
We then analyzed the temporal changes throughout a
60-min session in 5-min increments using a two-way
repeated measures ANOVA (Fig. 6A, B). Compared
with sham-surgery mice, mice with MCAO did not
exhibit signiﬁcant behavioral alterations in either
locomotion or rearing at either time point; one exception

was not impaired in mice with MCAO treated with human umbilical
cord blood CD34+ cells (UCBCs) compared with sham-surgery mice.
However, there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the

was mice with MCAO treated with either PBS or UCBCs
that exhibited signiﬁcantly less prominent responses to
the dark environment with respect to locomotion at both
5 and 7 weeks after the insult. Overall, UCBC treatment
did not signiﬁcantly alter the behaviors in the mice with
neonatal stroke, as assessed with the open-ﬁeld test.

DISCUSSION
Only two cell types, the whole MNC fraction and MSCs, in
hUCB have been investigated as cell therapies in animal
models of NE to date. In the present study, the
intravenous administration of hUCB-CD34+ cells, which
are mostly hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial
progenitor cells, modestly ameliorated histological brain
injury after neonatal stroke in mice. The eﬀects were, at
least in part, due to the improved CBF in the ischemic
penumbra during the subacute phase of stroke, which
may be associated with the increased mean diameter of

in 5-min increments by a repeated-measures two-way ANOVA. (A)
With respect to locomotion (horizontal movement), the mice in all
three groups became hyperactive in response to the dark environment when assessed at 7 weeks after the insult. However, the
response was signiﬁcantly weaker in the mice with MCAO treated
with either PBS or human umbilical cord blood CD34+ cells (UCBCs)
compared with the sham-surgery mice. (B) With respect to rearing
(vertical movement), there were no signiﬁcant group diﬀerences at
7 weeks after the insult. UCBC treatment did not signiﬁcantly alter
behavior in the mice with neonatal stroke. ⁄P < 0.05 compared with

blood vessels observed in the peri-infarct area during
the chronic phase.
The purpose of the present study was to examine the
potential of the CD34+ cell fraction in human UCB; SCID
mice, which are deﬁcient in functional B and T
lymphocytes because of a single gene mutation, were
transfused with hUCB-CD34+ cells. Hence, the present
study used xenotransplantation; thus, caution should be
exercised when translating the data obtained in the present
study into the clinic. We used immunocompromized mice to
minimize the undesirable immunological and inﬂammatory
reactions caused by xenotransplantation as these reactions
are not induced in autologous transfusion, which is the
expected paradigm in the clinical application. To date, no
study has examined the eﬀects of allogeneic transplantation
with UCBCs in rodent models of brain injury. One reason is
because the rodent UCB is diﬀerent from the human
UCB; unlike in humans, mouse CD34+ cells are not
hematopoietic cells (Osawa et al., 1996). In addition,
collecting rodent UCBCs is technically diﬃcult.
We chose the timing of the cell transfusion to be 48 h
after the brain injury for numerous reasons. The optimal
time window of hUCBC therapies in animal models of
NE has not been examined. UCBCs were administered
24 h after the brain injury in most NE studies (Table 2).
Recent data on UCBCs and other types of stem cells in
adult rodent models suggest that a later timing of
transfusion, i.e., 48 or 72 h after the insult, is more
beneﬁcial (Newcomb et al., 2006; Rosenblum et al.,
2012; Uemura et al., 2012).
One of the key features of this study is that it was
performed using a highly reproducible model of NE, in
which the locations of the infarct and peri-infarct areas
were easily distinguishable and consistent between
animals. During the ﬁrst hours after brain injury, a
detrimental biological cascade begins, and cells are
destined to be damaged. We assumed that the
neuroprotective eﬀects would be limited when animals
were treated 48 h after the insult, even if the cell
treatment was potent. In fact, the hUCB-CD34+ cell
treatment achieved a modest, but statistically signiﬁcant,
amelioration of the brain injury. Similarly, the cell
treatment
exhibited
a
statistically
signiﬁcant
augmentation of the CBF in the peri-infarct region, but
not in other regions. These results suggest that the cell
therapy exerts neuroprotective eﬀects only in the periinfarct area and not in the ischemic core. Moreover,
these results suggest that it is crucial to examine the
eﬀects of treatment in a region-speciﬁc manner in a
highly reproducible model.
The amelioration rate of cerebral tissue loss by the
UCBC therapy was relatively small, and none of the
UCBC-treated mice exhibited outstanding improvement;
there may be a limit of the improvement in % stroke
volume, e.g., 17.5% in this study. This implies that the
ischemic core cannot be rescued or restored by cell
treatment. The result is well conceivable as the model
used in the present study is a permanent MCAO model
in mice with a CB-17 strain background, which has little
anastomoses between MCA and other cerebral arteries
(Taguchi et al., 2010). Even after removing the pup with

the most severe brain damage in the PBS group, the
ameliorating eﬀects of the cell therapy were statistically
signiﬁcant, conﬁrming the fact that the treatment eﬀect
is modest but signiﬁcant.
CD34+ cells as a neuroprotective treatment
The intravenous administration of hUCB-CD34+, but not
CD34 cells, ameliorates damage in adult mice with
permanent MCAO (Taguchi et al., 2004a) and in a rat
model of spinal cord injury (Kao et al., 2008). Boltze
et al. (2012) compared the eﬀects of the intravenous
administration of hUCB-MNCs (which contains a variety
of cells, including CD34+ cells), CD34+ cells, and
CD34 cells in adult rats with permanent MCAO. The
MNCs provided the most prominent neuroprotective
eﬀects, with CD34+ cells appearing to be particularly
involved in the protective action of MNCs. A study in a
rat model of myocardial infarction showed that CD34+
cell treatment elicited the greatest attenuation of the
damage with the high-dose MNC group (which
contained the same absolute CD34+ cell dose as the
CD34+ cell group) exhibiting a moderate attenuation
(Kawamoto et al., 2006). The beneﬁcial eﬀects of the
intravenous administration of hUCB-CD34+ cells have
also been reported in adult rat models of transient
MCAO (Chen et al., 2001; Ou et al., 2010), heatstroke
(Chen et al., 2007) and traumatic brain injury (Chen
et al., 2013). Among the variety of cell types in hUCB,
CD34+ cells play a crucial, if not absolute, role in the
neuroprotection aﬀorded by hUCBC treatment. In our

clinical studies of adult patients with cerebral ischemic
events, the number of circulating CD34+ cells was
inversely correlated with cerebral infarction and
positively correlated with CBF (Taguchi et al., 2004b,
2009). These results suggest that circulating CD34+
cells have a role in the maintenance of the cerebral
circulation in ischemic stress.
The administration of whole nucleated cells or the
MNC fraction isolated by a density gradient separation
is a simple approach for clinical application. Of note, the
‘‘MNC fraction’’ does not necessarily indicate that the
cells in the fraction are exclusively mononucleate cells.
The hUCB-MNC fraction isolated by gradient separation
using Ficoll-paque (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Amersham
Place, England) contains 1–20% granulocytes among
the recovered cells. As much as 46% of the MNC
fraction is composed of granulocytes after separation
from child bone marrow (Cox et al., 2011). As some
studies have shown that granulocytes are detrimental
for NE (Palmer et al., 2004), the administration of only
the beneﬁcial cell fraction may be important to improve
the clinical outcome.
Augmentation of CBF and modulation of blood
vessels by UCBC treatment
The present study shows that augmentation of CBF is one
of the beneﬁcial eﬀects of hUCB-CD34+ cell treatment.
Our previous study demonstrated that the degree of
CBF reduction in the subacute phase following neonatal
HI (24 h after the insult) correlated strongly with the

156

M. Tsuji et al. / Neuroscience 263 (2014) 148–158

subsequent morphological development of brain damage
in mice (Ohshima et al., 2012). This implies that
augmentation of the CBF during this phase may lead to
improvements in brain damage during the chronic
phase. We have previously reported that the
intravenous administration of hUCB-CD34+ cells
enhanced CBF just outside of the penumbra in an adult
mouse model of permanent MCAO (Taguchi et al.,
2004a). We have reported that the intravenous
administration of murine bone marrow MNCs markedly
augmented CBF in the early phase after treatment (6 h
after administration) in an adult mouse model of
ischemic white matter damage (Fujita et al., 2010).
Augmentation of CBF induced by CD34+ cell treatment
has also been reported in adult rat models of transient
three-vessel-occlusion (Shyu et al., 2006) and
heatstroke (Chen et al., 2007).
In the present study, we found that the cell therapy can
modulate the morphologies of blood vessels after an
ischemic insult, i.e., an enlarged diameter of blood
vessels. We have previously reported that cell therapies
can modulate the morphologies of blood vessels after
ischemic insults, leading to an increased density of blood
vessels in the adult models (Taguchi et al., 2004a; Fujita
et al., 2010). Angiogenesis facilitated by CD34+ cell
treatment has also been reported in other models of
brain injury (Shyu et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007, 2013)
and myocardial infarction (Kawamoto et al., 2006). In the
present study, there was no accumulation of hUCBCD34+ cells in the border area of the infarct; the number
of donor cells in the brain was substantially lower at 24 h
after administration, and the donor cells were virtually
absent by 10 days after administration. Therefore, it is
highly unlikely that the donor cells contributed physically
to the enlargement of the blood vessels after their
incorporation. Although we previously identiﬁed that a
few donor cells reside in the vascular walls and express
endothelial markers or features of pericytes, this is not a
prevalent phenomenon in the ischemic brain (Taguchi
et al., 2004a; Fujita et al., 2010). A body of evidence
demonstrates the beneﬁcial eﬀects of cell therapies in
animal models of brain injury in the absence (Borlongan
et al., 2004; Boltze et al., 2012) or paucity (Yasuhara
et al., 2010) of hUCBCs in brain tissue.
There have been no studies that directly examined
angiogenesis after hUCBC treatment in animal models
of NE. However, one study demonstrated a possible
association
between
hUCBC
treatment
and
angiogenesis in an animal model of NE. The study
showed that an intraperitoneal application of hUCBMNCs increased the expression of the proteins Tie-2,
occludin, and VEGF in the brain, which are associated
with angiogenesis (Rosenkranz et al., 2012). Increased
levels of VEGF in the central nervous system following
the intravenous administration of hUCB-CD34+ cells
have been reported in an adult rat model of spinal cord
injury (Kao et al., 2008). Increases in endothelial nitric
oxide synthase activation by bone marrow-MNC
treatment have been observed in ischemic brains (Fujita
et al., 2010). We suggest that the direct structural
incorporation of donor cells within blood vessels may

not be the main mechanism underlying the modulation
of CBF and blood vessels but rather VEGF, nitric oxide,
or unknown factors that are induced by cell treatment
are responsible.
Other eﬀects of UCBC treatment
Apart from its eﬀects on CBF and blood vessels, the
pluripotent nature of hUCBC treatment has been
reported to be one of the mechanisms responsible for
the beneﬁcial eﬀects of this treatment for NE (Verina
et al., 2013). Although there are no reports of the use of
hUCB-CD34+ cells in NE, there are 15 reports of the
use of other types of hUCBCs (Table 2). Systemic (i.e.,
intraperitoneal or intravenous) injection of hUCB-MNCs
in a neonatal rat model of HIE reduced apoptosis
(Pimentel-Coelho et al., 2010; Rosenkranz et al., 2012);
increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) (Rosenkranz et al., 2012), nerve growth
factor, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor
(GDNF) in the brain (Yasuhara et al., 2010); reduced
the activation of astrocytes (Wasielewski et al., 2012)
and microglia (Pimentel-Coelho et al., 2010;
Rosenkranz et al., 2013); reduced the increase in serum
levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (Rosenkranz et al.,
2013); and restored neural processing in the primary
somatosensory cortex (Geißler et al., 2011). Studies in
adult rodent models of CNS disorders have shown that
hUCB-CD34+ cell treatment increased brain levels of
trophic factors, i.e., GDNF, and decreased serum levels
of systemic inﬂammatory molecules, i.e., tumor necrosis
factor-a and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (Chen
et al., 2007, 2013; Kao et al., 2008; Ou et al., 2010).
Taken together, the major mechanisms responsible
for the beneﬁcial eﬀects of hUCB treatment for
cerebral ischemia appear to be related to either
immunomodulation/anti-inﬂammation
and/or
trophic
factor/cytokine production, independently of CBF/blood
vessel modulation. Our present study suggests that the
modulation of these immuno-inﬂammatory responses is
not the single mechanism of action of hUCBC treatment,
as SCID mice (which lack both functional T and B
lymphocytes) exhibited improvement after cell therapy.

CONCLUSIONS
This study shows that the intravenous administration of
hUCB-CD34+ cells 48 h after neonatal stroke modestly
ameliorates brain injury in a mouse model.
