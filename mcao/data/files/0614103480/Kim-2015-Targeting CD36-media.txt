SUMMARY
Aims: The pathology of stroke consists of multiple pro-death processes, and CD36 has been
suggested as a multimodal target to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in ischemic
stroke. Using CD36-deficient mice and SS-31, a cell permeable tetrapeptide known to
down-regulate CD36 pathways, the current study investigated whether targeting CD36 is
effective in transient and permanent ischemic stroke. Methods: Wild-type or CD36deficient mice were subjected to either 30-min transient or permanent focal ischemic
stroke. In parallel, a cohort of mice subjected to either transient or permanent stroke
received either vehicle or 5 mg/kg of SS-31. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)
and its receptor CCR2, mRNA levels, and infarct volume and percent hemispheric swelling
were measured in the postischemic brain. Results: CD36 deficiency or SS-31 treatment significantly attenuated MCP-1 or CCR2 mRNA up-regulation and injury size in the transient
ischemic stroke. However, the approaches failed to show the protective effect in permanent
ischemic stroke. Conclusion: The study revealed that targeting CD36 has a beneficial effect
on transient but not permanent focal ischemic stroke. The study thus precludes a generalized strategy targeting CD36 in ischemic stroke and suggests careful consideration of types
of stroke and associated pathology in developing stroke therapies.

Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. More
than 80% of stroke patients suffer from ischemic stroke, with or
without spontaneous reperfusion. Tissue plasminogen activator
(tPA) is an endogenous thrombolytic agent that aids in recanalization when given within 3–6 h after stroke onset [1]. While early
reperfusion limits brain injury, it also introduces excessive oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to ischemic/reperfusion
injury [2–4]. Published reports have shown that levels of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory chemokines and cytokines are significantly increased in the ischemic brain, and they
are positively correlated with injury size [5–9]. Thus, targeting
ROS production and/or inflammation might be a useful strategy
to minimize the ischemic/reperfusion injury.
CD36 is a class B scavenger receptor that is expressed in microglia, astrocytes, microvascular endothelial cells, peripheral monocytes/macrophages, and platelets [10–14]. By binding a host of
ligands, CD36 plays a role in inflammation, innate immunity, and
vascular dysfunction [11,15–19]. Previously, we reported that
CD36 contributes to acute ischemic injury by increasing oxidative
stress and inflammation, and the genetic deficiency of CD36

resulted in neuroprotection [8,9,20]. CD36 is up-regulated in
ischemic brain and regulates the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and CCR2, an important chemokine/receptor axis for mononuclear cell infiltration in stroke
[9,20,21]. The involvement of CD36 in postinjury inflammatory
responses suggests CD36 as a potential target against focal ischemic stroke. SS-31 is the first compound shown to attenuate the
up-regulation of CD36 and reduce brain injury in transient focal
ischemic stroke [22]. In a model of renal ischemia–reperfusion
injury, SS-31 has also been shown to reduce oxidative stress and
ameliorate the up-regulation of MCP-1 and TNF-a [23].
Permanent occlusion has been shown to be refractory to the
treatments that were effective in transient ischemic stroke. For
instance, hyperbaric oxygen preconditioning, dextromethorphan
treatment, an antiintercellular adhesion molecule-1 antibody, and
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-c (PPAR-c) showed
benefits in tMCAO but not in pMCAO [24–26]. Although CD36induced inflammation is a known component of ischemia–reperfusion injury, it is not clear whether CD36 is up-regulated in
permanent ischemic stroke, and whether prevention of CD36
up-regulation, either genetically or pharmacologically, impacts on
inflammation and outcome in permanent focal ischemic stroke.

Targeting CD36 in Acute Stroke

Here, we report that inflammatory responses are largely blunted
in permanent ischemic stroke compared to transient ischemic
stroke. While targeting CD36 was effective against transient ischemic stroke, the strategy has little efficacy in permanent occlusion,
suggesting alternative strategies for focal ischemic stroke without
reperfusion.

Materials and methods
Animals
The use of animals and procedures was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Weill Medical
College of Cornell University and in accordance with the IACUC,
National Institutes of Health, and ARRIVE guidelines. Experiments were performed in 10- to 11-week-old male C57BL/6,
wild-type (WT), or CD36 knock-out (CD36 KO) mice. C57BL/6
mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME,
USA). Breeding pairs of each WT and CD36 KO strain (seven times
backcrossed with C57BL/6, 99.7% C57BL/6 background) were
derived at the time of the heterozygote cross. From these breeding
pairs, only F1 generation was used for the study without further
sister–brother mating. The procedures for genotyping have been
described previously [16,27]. The mice were housed at the institute’s animal facility, which monitors and maintains temperature,
humidity, and 12-h light/dark cycle. Maximum five mice were
housed in a cage with an individual ventilating system and
irradiated bedding (1/8″ Bed O’s Cobs; The Anderson, Maumee,
OH, USA). Sterilized food (PicoLab Rodent diet 5053; LabDiet,
St. Louise, MO, USA) and water were freely accessible in their
cage.

Transient or Permanent Middle Cerebral Artery
Occlusion
Mice were randomly selected and subjected to middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) as previously described [20,28]. A fiber
optic probe was glued to the parietal bone (2 mm posterior and
5 mm lateral to the bregma) and connected to a Laser Doppler
Flowmeter (Periflux System 5010; Perimed, J€arf€alla, Sweden) for
continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the ischemic territory. For MCAO, a 6-0 Teflon-coated black monofilament
surgical suture (Doccol Co., Redland, CA, USA) was inserted into
the exposed external carotid artery, advanced into the internal
carotid artery, and wedged into the cerebral arterial circle to
obstruct the origin of the MCA. For transient MCAO (tMCAO),
the filament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion after 30-min
MCAO. Only animals that exhibited greater than 80% reduction
in CBF during MCAO and greater than 80% reperfusion 10 min
following reperfusion were included in the study. For permanent
MCAO (pMCAO), the CBF reduction was monitored for 10 min
and the incision was closed by wound clip without the filament
withdrawing. Buprenorphine, lidocaine, and bupivacaine were
administered during postischemia as analgesics. Mice were then
placed in a recovery cage until the animal regained consciousness
and resumed activity. Using a rectal probe controlled by a Masterflex pump and thermistor temperature controller (Cole-Parmer,
Vernon Hills, IL, USA), the animals’ body temperature was main-

tained at 37  0.5°C during MCAO and recovery after surgery.
The mice were then returned to their home cages where they were
previously housed together. For hydrating animals after surgery,
hydrogel (ClearH2O, Portland, ME, USA) was provided with food.

SS-31 Treatment
SS-31 (D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH2; Dmt-20 ,60 -dimethyltyrosine) was
prepared by Dr. Peter W. Schiller (Clinical Research Institute of
Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada) using solid-phase synthesis as
described previously [29]. Stroked C57BL/6 male mice were
randomized to receive saline (veh) or SS-31. The treatment and
dosages were followed according to a previous report [22]. Briefly,
animals were treated intraperitoneally with veh or 5 mg/kg of
SS-31 immediately after the reperfusion for tMCAO or immediately before the mice were released from anesthesia for pMCAO,
and at 6, 24, and 48 h postischemia.

Tissue Collection for Infarct Volume and Gene
Assessment
To obtain tissue that contains the entire infarct territory in an
unbiased manner, an unbiased stereological sampling strategy was
used according to the method described in the previous study
[20,28]. One or three days after tMCAO or pMCAO, brains were
excised, frozen, and serial sections spanning about 6 mm rostrocaudal (roughly +2.8 mm and extending to 3.8 mm from
bregma) were collected. The entire infarct region was cryosectioned for infarct volume measurement (20 lm thickness) and
collected serially at 600-micron intervals. Infarct volume and %
hemispheric swelling were measured using Axiovision software
(Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Infarct volume was corrected for swelling
by a method described previously [30]. Tissues between sections
for infarct volume were serially cryosectioned, cut in half, and collected from each hemisphere for gene assessment.

Measurement of Gene Expression
Gene expression levels were quantified by real-time quantitative
RT-PCR (qPCR) using fluorescent TaqMan technology as
described previously [20,28]. Briefly, total RNA was extracted
from brain tissues using Tri reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH, USA).
RNAs were reverse transcribed using the QuantiTech reverse transcription kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). PCR primers and
probes specific for CD36, MCP-1, CCR2, and b-actin (an internal
control) were obtained as TaqMan predeveloped optimized assay
reagents for gene expression (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY,
USA). The PCR reaction was performed using FastStart Universal
Probe Master Mix (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Reactions were performed in
20 lL total volume and incubated at 95°C for 10 min followed by
40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C. The results
were analyzed using 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System software
(Life Technologies).

Data Analysis
Sample size for infarct measurement (minimum n = 8/group) was
calculated based on predicting detectable differences to reach

power of 0.80 at a significance level of <0.05, assuming a 30% difference in mean and a 20% SD at the 95% confidence level.
Infarct volume and percent hemispheric swelling were expressed
as mean  95% confidence interval (CI). Gene expression levels
were presented as the b-actin normalized value according to the
formula, Value = 2(Ct of b-actin  Ct of target gene). Comparison
between two groups was statistically evaluated using Student’s
t-test. Multiple comparisons were made using ANOVA followed
by a post hoc Newman–Keuls test. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results
The Absence of CD36 Reduces Inflammation and
Brain Injury in Transient Focal Ischemia
To investigate the relevance of CD36 to inflammatory response
following transient focal ischemic stroke, MCP-1 and CCR2 gene
expressions in the brain were determined in WT and CD36 knockout (CD36 KO) mice at 1 day after tMCAO. Compared to WT
mice, the absence of CD36 attenuated stroke-induced MCP-1 and
CCR2 expressions (Figure 1A and B). As we previously reported
[8], CD36 deficiency resulted in reduced brain injury size and
swelling assessed at 3 days poststroke (Figure 1C and D). The
association between attenuated MCP-1 and CCR2 expressions and
improved outcomes in CD36 KO mice confirms the involvement
of CD36 in inflammation and injury in transient focal ischemia.

CD36 Deficiency does not Reduce Inflammatory
Responses and Ischemic Brain Injury in
Permanent Focal Ischemia
To investigate the role of CD36 in acute stroke without reperfusion, MCA was permanently occluded (pMCAO) in WT and CD36
KO mice. MCP-1 gene expression was significantly elevated at
1 day poststroke, and the levels were similar between WT and
CD36 KO mice (Figure 2A). Interestingly, the increase in MCP-1

levels in pMCAO was smaller compared to tMCAO (tMCAO vs.
pMCAO [9103], 39.7  3.1 vs. 19.7  2.9, P < 0.01) in WT
mice, suggesting less inflammation in ischemic stroke without
reperfusion. Stroke also increased CCR2 gene expressions in WT
mice, and the induction was reduced in CD36 KO mice (Figure 2B). Infarct size and % swelling were significantly larger with
pMCAO compared to tMCAO (tMCAO vs. pMCAO, infarct size
[mm3], 43.3  5.01 vs. 59.4  2.4, P < 0.05; % swelling,
13.3  2.6 vs. 37.8  3.2, P < 0.001), and there was no difference between WT and CD36 KO mice (Figure 2C and D). The
results suggest that pMCAO is associated with less inflammatory
responses but results in larger injury, and CD36 does not play a
role in ischemic injury without reperfusion.

SS-31 Reduces Inflammation and Brain Injury in
Transient Focal Ischemia
SS-31 has been shown to attenuate stroke-induced glutathione
depletion and ischemic brain injury, and the attenuation was
associated with attenuation of CD36 up-regulation [22]. As SS-31
reduced infarct size in tMCAO [22], we determined the effect of
SS-31 on MCP-1 and CCR2 expressions following tMCAO. Stroke
increased CD36 mRNA levels at 24 h after tMCAO, and it was
attenuated by SS-31 treatment (Figure 3A). SS-31 also significantly reduced MCP-1 mRNA levels in the stroked hemisphere
(Figure 3B). Unlike CD36 KO mice, SS-31 did not have any effect
on CCR2 mRNA levels (Figure 3C). Infarct volume and % hemispheric swelling were significantly smaller in the mice treated
with SS-31 compared to vehicle-treated mice (Figure 3D and E),
showing the efficacy of SS-31 in suppressing MCP-1 expression
that is associated with neuroprotection in transient focal ischemia.

pMCAO [9103], 58.0  8.1 vs. 15.6  5.7, P < 0.01) and this
was also not affected by SS-31 (Figure 4B). In contrast, the
increase in CCR2 mRNA levels at 1 day postischemia was comparable to tMCAO, and SS-31 did not attenuate its expression (Fig-

spatially overlap, diverge, or cross talk, activating different sets of
pathological pathways. The current study investigated strokeinduced inflammation and acute outcome in two different ischemic stroke models (transient or permanent focal stroke), focusing
on their responses to approaches directed at CD36. The results
show that targeting CD36, either genetically or pharmacologically,
demonstrated beneficial effects by reducing inflammation and
injury in transient focal stroke, but failed to show benefit in permanent focal stroke.
CD36 expression occurs in a feed-forward manner in the presence of ligands [34–36]. With increased generation of CD36
ligands including long-chain fatty acids, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and thrombospondins in stroke [37–41], CD36
elicits intracellular signaling and produces inflammatory cytokines
and chemokines [17,42–44]. Among them, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and CCR2, a receptor for MCP-1, play
an important role in attracting peripheral immune cells into the
injury site [45–48]. Our previous study also suggested an involvement of CD36 in regulating the expression of MCP-1 and CCR2 in
focal ischemic stroke [9,20]. The current study addressed the
influence of different types of stroke on MCP-1 and CCR2 expressions by targeting CD36. We observed protection in CD36 KO
mice subjected to tMCAO (Figure 1) but not pMCAO (Figure 2).
Complementary to CD36 genetic approach, the pharmacological
approach using SS-31 similarly resulted in neuroprotection in
tMCAO (Figure 3) but not in pMCAO (Figure 4).
Underlying mechanism that account for the difference in brain
injury and swelling between the two models may derive from the
extent of acute inflammatory responses associated with cerebral
ischemia, with or without reperfusion. Acute inflammatory
responses appear to be a major pathological event in ischemic

stroke. Both tMCAO and pMCAO elicit the acute inflammatory
response; however, this study shows that MCP-1 expression was
profoundly increased in tMCAO and much less in pMCAO. The
down-regulation of CD36 by genetic or pharmacological means
reduced MCP-1 up-regulation in tMCAO (Figures 1A and 3B) but
had no effect in pMCAO (Figures 2A and 4B). These results suggest that CD36 does not play a significant role in MCP-1 induction
in permanent focal stroke. Unlike MCP-1, the modulation of
CCR2 mRNA levels was different between genetic CD36 deficiency and pharmacological approaches. In both tMCAO and
pMCAO, CCR2 expression was reduced in CD36 KO mice (Figures 1B and 2B), but the expression was not changed by SS-31
treatment (Figures 3C and 4C). This may due to several reasons.
The timing of infiltration of CCR2+ mononuclear phagocytes into
the injured site, where up-regulation of CCR2 in the postischemic
brain, lags behind the up-regulation of MCP-1 [20]. Alternative
explanations for the difference may include the regulation of
CCR2 expression by other ligands in addition to MCP-1 and a
developmental compensation and/or a long-term preventative
effect in genetic CD36 deficiency, while SS-31 treatment reflects
the prevention of CD36 up-regulation in acute stroke.
Although genes that are involved in stress responses, cell death,
and metabolism are commonly induced in tMCAO and pMCAO,
comparison of expression profiles between the models indicates
that gene induction is unique to each model. Stroke with reperfusion induces genes encoding inflammation, apoptosis, and cell
cycle, while genes associated with neurotransmitter receptors, ion
channels, growth factors, and signaling molecules are linked to
permanent occlusion [49]. Despite the blunted inflammatory
responses in pMCAO, larger injury size was observed in this study.
Both infarct size and swelling were significantly greater in

pMCAO compared to tMCAO and reperfusion reduced infarct size
by ~30%, and swelling was almost threefold lower despite a larger
increase in MCP-1 and CCR2 expressions. These suggest that factors other than inflammation contribute to ischemic injury in the
setting of stroke without reperfusion. A lack of ATP during ischemia results in apoptosis or necrosis, and rapid reperfusion minimizes cell death and infarct size. However, ischemia causes
mitochondrial swelling, slows down the recovery of ATP synthesis
upon reperfusion, and produces excess inflammatory mediators
[50–54]. Our study shows that CD36 plays a role in mediating this
inflammatory response and benefits can be accomplished by
attenuating the inflammatory process that occurs upon reperfusion.
SS-31 is a cell permeable, mitochondria-targeted tetrapeptide
that has been shown to attenuate the up-regulation of CD36 upon
reperfusion [22]. The SS peptides are highly water-soluble, and
their tissue distribution is largely determined by blood flow [55],
thus, compared to tMCAO, SS-31 would be delivered substantially
less to the ischemic site in pMCAO. Because peripheral monocytes/macrophages contribute to stoke-induced brain injury and
SS-31 modulates CD36 expression on these cells [22], it is possible
to have indirect effects exerted by these immune cells to brain
injury. However, pMCAO did not resulted in reduction of infarct
in CD36 KO mice (Figure 2C). Therefore, the genetic evidence
indicates that the reason for failure to reduce infarct in SS-31-treated pMCAO mice is likely due to differential pathophysiology
associated with pMCAO model, which is distinct from CD36-associated acute inflammatory pathology.
Early studies showed that SS-31 selectively partitions to the
inner mitochondrial membrane, and its dimethyltyrosine residue
can scavenge excess electrons and reduce mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species [56,57]. It was recently reported that SS-31 interacts with cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane and

modulates its interaction with cytochrome c [58,59]. As a result,
SS-31 inhibits cytochrome c peroxidase activity and promotes
electron transport and ATP synthesis [58]. SS-31 can also reduce
electron leak and reactive oxygen species production. By inhibiting cardiolipin peroxidation, the peptide protects mitochondrial
structure, accelerates ATP recovery upon reperfusion, and reduces
cell death and inflammation [59,60]. SS-31 was effective in ameliorating reperfusion injury following myocardial ischemia in a
preclinical study, which led to the EMBRACE-STEMI trial with
Bendavia (clinical formulation of SS-31) for patients receiving
percutaneous coronary reperfusion for ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction (NCT01572909) [61]. Additionally, its efficacy in improving renal outcome after revascularization in renal
artery stenosis in pigs [23] led to a clinical trial for patients undergoing percutaneous angioplasty of the renal artery (NCT
01755858). Thus, our findings suggest that attenuating inflammatory responses directing CD36 is a promising strategy for acute
transient ischemic stroke. Importantly, SS-31/Bendavia may serve
as a potential therapeutic for minimizing ischemia–reperfusion
injury, especially in stroke patients who receive tPA.
