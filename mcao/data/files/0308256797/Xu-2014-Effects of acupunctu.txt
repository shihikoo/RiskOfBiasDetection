Abstract
Background/Purpose: Ischemic stroke is characterized by high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), aquaporin (AQP) 4, and AQP9 are linked to permeabilization of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI). BBB disruption, tissue inflammation, and MMP/AQP upregulation jointly provoke brain
edema/swelling after CIRI, while acupuncture and electroacupuncture can alleviate CIRI symptoms. This study evaluated the
hypothesis that acupuncture and electroacupuncture can similarly exert neuroprotective actions in a rat model of middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by modulating MMP2/AQP4/APQ9 expression and inflammatory cell infiltration.
Methods: Eighty 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham group S, MCAO model group M,
acupuncture group A, electroacupuncture group EA, and edaravone group ED. The MCAO model was established by
placement of a suture to block the middle carotid artery, and reperfusion was triggered by suture removal in all groups
except group S. Acupuncture and electroacupuncture were administered at acupoints GV20 (governing vessel-20) and ST36
(stomach-36). Rats in groups A, EA, and ED received acupuncture, electroacupuncture, or edaravone, respectively,
immediately after MCAO. Neurological function (assessed using the Modified Neurological Severity Score), infarct volume,
MMP2/AQP4/AQP9 mRNA and protein expression, and inflammatory cell infiltration were all evaluated at 24 h postreperfusion.
Results: Acupuncture and electroacupuncture significantly decreased infarct size and improved neurological function.
Furthermore, target mRNA and protein levels and inflammatory cell infiltration were significantly reduced in groups A, EA,
and ED vs. group M. However, MMP2/AQP levels and inflammatory cell infiltration were generally higher in groups A and EA
than in group ED except MMP2 mRNA levels.
Conclusions: Acupuncture and electroacupuncture at GV20 and ST36 both exercised neuroprotective actions in a rat model
of MCAO, with no clear differences between groups A and EA. Therefore, acupuncture and electroacupuncture might find
utility as adjunctive and complementary treatments to supplement conventional therapy for ischemic stroke.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke accounts for more than 80% of all stroke cases
and has a high morbidity and mortality worldwide [1,2].
Reperfusion damage occurs when blood returns to the brain after
a period of ischemia, continuing even after blood flow is restored
[3]. Accordingly, reperfusion occupies an important position in the
pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia [4], and many pathological
events are associated with cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
injury (CIRI). These events encompass inflammation, increased

Acupuncture and MMP/AQP4/AQP9 Expression in MCAO Rats

So far, only one drug has been approved for the treatment of
ischemic stroke: the aforementioned tissue plasminogen activator,
a thrombolytic agent. Unfortunately, the use of thrombolytic
agents is controversial due to the increased risk of hemorrhage and
neuronal death, prompting a search for safer and more efficacious
ways to manage ischemic stroke. To this end, recent evidence
suggests that acupuncture could be useful for the management of
CIRI. Acupuncture is an alternative therapy that complements
conventional medicine. Acupuncture was derived at least 2,500
years ago as an ancient Chinese treatment for illness, pain, and
metabolic and pathological brain diseases. Many acupoints can be
chosen for therapy, including Renzhong (governing vessel-6,
GV6), Baihui (GV20), Zusanli (stomach-36, ST36), and Waiguan
(triple energizer-5, TE5). Electrical stimulation in the form of
electroacupuncture is usually applied to one or more acupoints for
the treatment of ischemic stroke in China, enhancing the
therapeutic effects of acupuncture alone. Acupuncture has recently
been used to accelerate the rehabilitation of patients with brain
ischemia, but its mechanism(s) of action and the added benefit of
electrical stimulation for stroke remain unclear.
Our previous work indicated that electroacupuncture at GV20
and ST36 can improve neurological outcomes in CIRI model rats,
and also reduce inflammation and MMP9 expression in the brain
[18,19]. The current study explored the hypothesis that acupuncture alone and electroacupuncture at GV20 and ST36 can
similarly confer neuroprotection in a rat model of middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) via attenuation of MMP2/AQP4/
AQP9 expression and inflammatory cell infiltration in the ischemic
brain. As a standard treatment for CIRI, the effects of edaravone,
a free radical scavenger [20], were compared with those of
acupuncture and electroacupuncture.

factor-a, and interleukin-6, and infiltrating macrophages and
neutrophils join leukocytes to induce/activate MMPs. Cerebral
inflammatory responses are then amplified by the actions of
cytokines and MMPs, the disruption of the BBB, and the
development of brain edema [5].
The BBB crucially contributes to brain homeostasis [6] and is
mostly formed by the endothelial cells of the microvasculature.
The BBB facilitates selective, diffusion-mediated exchange of
membrane-permeant molecules between the circulating blood and
the central nervous system, and in this manner protects the brain
from extraneous compounds and neurotoxic substances. Microvessel endothelial cells are connected to each other, to surrounding
pericytes, and to the foot processes of astrocytes by tight junctions.
These cells work together to uphold normal BBB function.
The composition and structure of the BBB includes many
factors that either maintain or disturb the fluid balance in the
brain during normal and pathological processes. For example,
astrocytes secrete the pro-ischemic mediator, transforming growth
factor-b, during pathological processes such as CIRI; transforming
growth factor-b then goes on to affect the function of various cell
types in the ischemic brain [7]. Ischemic stroke is similarly
associated with the activation of tissue plasminogen activator, a
serine protease, and the generation of thrombomodulin, an
anticoagulant [8]. Furthermore, the structure and function of the
vascular basement membrane/extracellular matrix [9,10], and the
expression levels of aquaporin (AQP) water channels in astrocytes
and endothelial cells [11], are altered during ischemic brain injury
and disease. Based on these pathophysiological changes and the
identified molecular targets, many directed anti-stroke therapies
are now under investigation to prevent destruction of the BBB. Of
the potential molecular targets, the MMPs and the AQPs form the
predominant focus of our study.
MMPs belong to a family of Zn2+-dependent enzymes that
degrade and re-establish the extracellular matrix during normal
development and growth. MMPs are also implicated in BBB
permeabilization and destruction [12]. During ischemic stroke,
oxygen deficiency secondary to the obstruction of blood flow
precipitates the inflammatory response and the upregulation of
MMPs, also termed gelatinases. MMPs/gelatinases can activate
numerous proinflammatory agents, disrupt the BBB, and provoke
encephaledema and cerebral hemorrhage [13]. Among the
MMPs, MMP2 plays an especially important role in sustaining
the water balance of the brain and is commonly present on the
foot processes of astrocytes and in the extracellular matrix of
vascular endothelial cells.
AQPs are mostly present on brain vessels and astrocytic endfeet
around lateral ventricle and ependymal cells. AQPs (AQP4 and
AQP9), like MMPs, critically participate in the destruction of the
BBB after CIRI, and AQP4 deficiency reportedly attenuates acute
ischemic injury by reducing brain edema in acute focal cerebral
ischemia [14]. Interestingly, MMPs and AQP4 expression levels
seem to be co-regulated in the modulation of water homeostasis.
For example, when MMPs were upregulated during CIRI-related
inflammatory processes, the concomitant overexpression of AQP4
in astrocyte endfeet ‘‘OAPs’’ (orthogonal arrays of particles) led to
particle disruption, BBB destruction, and ensuing brain edema
[15].
The function of QAP-9 is very similar to QAP-4. They are both
observed in astrocytes and vascular endothelial cells after stroke,
and the expression of the two proteins coincides with the
accumulation of water and other small solutes [16,17]. These
observations suggest that AQP-4 and AQP-9 cooperatively induce
brain edema by acting as conduits to accelerate water transport
between fluid compartments across the BBB and into the brain.

Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
All procedures were performed in accordance with the Ethics
Committees of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH,
Beijing, China) and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences
(Beijing, China), as well as the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,
USA). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and the
number of animals employed. In addition, the Ethics Committees
of PUMCH and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences
specifically approved this study (permit No. D-002).

Rat model of CIRI
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 80) weighing 230–250 g
were housed in an environmentally controlled room at PUMCH
(2262uC with a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle). The rats were
supplied with standard rat chow and water in ad libitum. Focal
cerebral ischemia was induced by MCAO, as described previously
[21] with slight modifications. Briefly, MCAO was performed
using an occluding suture (diameter, 0.26 mm) for 2 h, as follows.
Rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (1001g/0.3 ml)
via intraperitoneal injection. The cutaneous operational area was
cleaned regularly, and a 2–3 cm incision was made in the skin of
the neck. The right common carotid artery, the external carotid
artery, and the internal carotid artery were isolated. The external
carotid artery was ligated, blood flow was blocked, and a 4–0
monofilament with a blunted tip coated with poly-L-lysine was
inserted into the internal carotid artery through the external
carotid artery. The suture was advanced approximately 18–
20 mm beyond the carotid artery bifurcation until the origin of the
middle carotid artery was blocked. After 2 h of MCAO-evoked

the infarct volume percentage was calculated as: [(VC–VL)/VC]
6100%, where VC is the volume of the control contralateral
hemisphere, and VL is the volume of the non-infarcted tissue in the
lesioned ipsilateral hemisphere [23].

Rat groups and treatments
Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining

Rats were randomly divided into the following five groups
(n = 16 rats per group): (1) sham group S, (2) MCAO model group
M, (3) acupuncture group A, (4) electroacupuncture group EA,
and (5) edaravone group ED. Rats in model group M received
MCAO for 2 h, followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Rats in sham
group S received the same surgical procedures as those in model
group M, but the suture was not advanced beyond the internal
carotid bifurcation. No other treatments were given in sham group
S and model group M.
Animals in treatment groups A, EA, and ED received the first
treatment (acupuncture, electroacupuncture, or administration of
edaravone, a free radical scavenger, respectively) after MCAO for
2 h. They were then given the second acupuncture, electroacupuncture, or edaravone treatment after 22 h of reperfusion and
were euthanized 2 h later, for a total reperfusion time of 24 h in all
five rat groups.
The rats in group A were given acupuncture therapy for 20 min
at GV20 and left ST36 with disposable, sterile acupuncture
needles (diameter, 0.32 mm; length 25 mm; Tianjin Huahong
Medical Company, Tianjin, China). The needle was twisted 180
degrees at a rate of 10065 twists per min for 1 min, with the
twisting procedure repeated at 10-min intervals. Rats in group EA
received acupuncture therapy at GV20 and left ST36 with
disposable, sterile acupuncture needles and two electrodes
(Changzhou Wujin Great Wall Medical Instrument Co., Ltd.,
Changzou, China), with the electrode handles conjoint on GV20
and left ST36. The rats then underwent simultaneous acupuncture
and continuous-wave stimulation at a frequency of 2 Hz (intensity,
1 mA) for 20 min.
Finally, the rats in the ED group received 0.35 mg/kg of
edaravone (Nanjing Simcere Dongyuan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.,
Nanjing, China) by intraperitoneal injection.

H&E histology was conducted at 24 h after reperfusion. Rats
(n = 3 per group) were narcotized by an intraperitoneal injection of
10% chloral hydrate (100 g/0.3 ml) and then perfused transcardially with saline (250 ml), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
(250 ml). Brains were removed and fixed in 4% buffered
paraformaldehyde at 4uC for 72 h, and then dehydrated and
embedded in paraffin blocks. Coronal sections backward from the
optic chiasma were cut at a thickness of 3 mm. The sections were
deparaffinized and hydrated with decreasing concentrations of
alcohol, stained with H&E, and photographed under a Leica
DM400 microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
Expression levels of MMP2, AQP4, and AQP9 mRNA were
determined by qPCR. Total RNA was extracted from the lesion
boundary zone of the ipsilateral hemisphere (n = 3 rats per group)
using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA).
Extracted total RNA was then reverse transcribed to generate cDNA.
The reverse transcription reaction was amplified using a Bio-Rad
CFX96 Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with the
PlexorTM One-Step qRT-PCR System (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA). For MMP2, AQP4, and AQP9 amplification, the following
primers were used: MMP2 forward, 59-ACGCTGATGGCGAGTACTGCA-39, and reverse, 59-CCATGGTAAACAAGGCTTCGTG-39; AQP4 forward, 59-TCCTTTGGCCCTGCAGTTATC-39, and reverse, 59-AGGCTTCCTTTAGGCGACGTT39, and AQP9 forward, 59-GGGTCCTATGATTGGTGCTTTC39, and reverse, 59-CCCAGGATACTAACCACGAAAG-39. The
fold change in relative mRNA expression was determined using the
22DDCt method [24] and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GADPH) as an internal control. For GAPDH amplification, the
following primers were used: GADPH forward, 59-CACAGCAAGTTCAACGGCACAG-39, and reverse, 59-GACGCCAGTAGACTCCACGACA-39.

Evaluation of neurological function
At 24 h post-reperfusion, neurological function was assessed in
eight animals (n = 8 per group) by an observer who was blinded to
the experimental conditions. The evaluation of neurological
function was performed using the Modified Neurological Severity
Score (mNSS) testing approach [22]. The mNSS is composed of a
series of motor tests (i.e., muscle status and abnormal movements),
sensory tests (i.e., visual, tactile, and proprioceptive assessment),
balance tests, and reflex tests, and is graded on a composite scale of
0–18. The higher the mNSS, the more severe the injury.

Immunofluorescence analysis
Brain tissue sections were prepared as described above for H&E
staining (n = 6 rats per group). The sections were incubated with
3% hydrogen peroxide and 5% normal goat serum at room
temperature for 30 min each, followed by incubation overnight at
4uC with mouse monoclonal anti-MMP2 antibody (diluted 1:150;
Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA), mouse polyclonal antiAQP4 antibody (diluted 1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA), rabbit polyclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic
(GFAP) antibody (diluted 1:500; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and
rabbit polyclonal anti-CD34 antibody (diluted 1:200; Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). The remaining procedures conformed to
standard protocols. Images were captured under a Leica Axio
Observer A1 fluorescence microscope.

Assessment of infarct volume
After assessment of neurological function, rats (n = 3 per group)
were narcotized by an intraperitoneal injection of 10% chloral
hydrate (100 g/0.3 ml) and sacrificed by decapitation at 24 h after
reperfusion. Brains were quickly removed and chilled at 220uC
for 10 min. Five consecutive 2-mm coronal sections were then
prepared, beginning from the anterior pole. The sections were
immediately immersed in 0.1% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) prepared in
phosphate buffered saline for 30 min at 37uC and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for 1 h. The TTC-stained sections were
photographed, and the infarct area was measured by an observer
blinded to the experimental conditions using image analysis
software (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health). To account for

zone. In addition, the numbers of MPO+ cells and CD68+ cells
were quantified in each 1-mm2 area of the ischemic penumbra and
the ischemic core zone.

Statistical analysis
All quantitative data are expressed as the mean 6 the standard
deviation (SD) and were analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences) 17.0 statistical analysis software (IBM,
Chicago, IL, USA). The data were subjected to a one-way analysis
of variance between different groups, followed by the least
significant difference t-test. In all cases, P,0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All final results were analyzed by observers
blinded to the experimental conditions.

Western blot analysis
The lesion boundary zone of the ischemic hemisphere (n = 4
rats per group) was dissected and homogenized in RadioImmunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, Jiangsu, China), and total protein was separated by
centrifugation at 13,0006g for 15 min at 4uC. Supernatants were
harvested, and the protein concentration of each sample was
determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Beyotime Biotechnology). For gel electrophoresis, samples were separated in 12%
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and separated proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes
(Millipore).
After transfer, the membranes were blocked for 2 h with 5%
nonfat milk (BD-Becton, Dickinson and Company, San Antonio,
TX, USA) and incubated overnight at 4uC with the following
primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-MMP2 antibody
(diluted 1:500; Novus Biologicals), rabbit polyclonal anti-AQP4
antibody (diluted 1:2000; Abcam), and rabbit polyclonal antiAQP9 antibody (diluted 1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots
were also incubated with a primary antibody against b-actin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which was employed as an internal
control for the normalization of protein loading. After three
washes, the membranes were incubated for 2 h with speciesspecific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies
(diluted 1:5000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc., West Grove, PA,
USA). The immunoreactive protein bands were detected using an
enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Millipore) and quantified using

Results
Assessment of infarct volume in CIRI model rats
Infarct volume as a measure of stroke severity was first
determined in the five rat groups (sham group S, MCAO model
group M, acupuncture group A, electroacupuncture group EA,
and edaravone group ED). Acupuncture and electroacupuncture
both significantly decreased the volume of the MCAO-evoked
infarct region (compare groups A and E with model group M), as
assessed by TTC staining (Figure 1A and 1B). No significant
differences in infarct volume were detected between the three
treatment groups (A, EA, and ED), confirming the neuroprotective
effect of acupuncture and electroacupuncture against CIRI.

Neurological outcomes
To investigate whether acupuncture or electroacupuncture can
influence neurological function in CIRI model rats, neurological
testing was performed using the mNSS approach at 24 h after
reperfusion. Rats receiving acupuncture or electroacupuncture
showed significant improvements in neurological function compared with MCAO model group M (Figure 1C). No significant
differences in the mNSS were found between treatment groups A,
EA, and ED.

performing an immunohistochemical analysis of target protein
expression, followed by semi-quantitative measurement of the
integrated optical density of MMP2/AQP4/APQ9 labeling.
Consequently, MMP2, AQP4, and AQP9 expression levels were
higher in the ischemic penumbra than in the ischemic core for all
five groups of rats (Figure 6A, 6B, 6D, 6E, 6G, and 6H). However,
significantly lower amounts of each protein were detected in group
S vs. groups M, A, EA, and ED, and in groups A, EA, and ED vs.
group M. No statistically significant differences were discerned
between groups A and EA (Figure 6C, 6F, and 6I).

Evaluation of cerebral histology by H&E and NeuN
staining
H&E staining (Figure 2) was performed to evaluate histopathological alterations after focal ischemia, and immunohistochemical
staining for NeuN, a neuronal nuclear antigen (Figure 3), was
performed to evaluate neuronal loss, nuclear shrinkage, and
neuronal vacuolization in CIRI model rats. Normal neurons in the
contralateral hemisphere had round, lightly stained nuclei
(Figure 2A), whereas dying neurons in the ipsilateral hemisphere
had pyknotic nuclei (black arrows, Figure 2B and 2C) and already
showed signs of vacuolization (red arrows, Figure 2B and 2C) in
the core ischemic zone and the ischemic penumbra at 24 h after
reperfusion. Furthermore, NeuN staining revealed a remarkable
loss of neurons in MCAO model group M compared with sham
group S and treatment groups A, EA, and ED, whereas the
changes in the number of neurons observed between groups A,
EA, and ED were not apparent (Figure 3).

Protein expression levels of MMP2, AQP4, and AQP9 in
the lesion boundary zone of the ipsilateral hemisphere
To further investigate the influence of acupuncture and
electroacupuncture on the expression patterns of MMP2, AQP4,
and AQP9, Western blotting analysis was used to compare target
protein levels in the lesion boundary zone in the five rat groups.
The Western blotting data (Figure 7) verified the immunohistochemical findings (Figure 6), in that the protein expression levels of
MMP2, AQP4, and AQP9 were all significantly higher in group
M than in the other four groups (P,0.05). All three proteins were
expressed at similar levels in groups A and EA, while the lowest
protein expression levels were found in group ED (Figure 7).

Effects of acupuncture and electroacupuncture on the
mRNA expression levels of MMP2, AQP4, and AQP9
The mechanistic actions of acupuncture and electroacupuncture
were explored by investigating their influence on MMP2, APQ4,
and AQP9 mRNA expression. The mRNA expression levels of all
three target proteins were significantly increased in model group
M relative to sham group S, and in model group M relative to
each of the three treatment groups (Figure 4). Groups A, EA, and
ED showed no significant inter-group differences between the
mRNA expression levels of MMP2, but the mRNA expression
levels of AQP4 and AQP9 were significantly lower in edaravone
group ED than in groups A and EA.

Quantification of MPO+ and CD68+ cells in the ischemic
penumbra and the core zone
Finally, immunohistochemical staining for MPO and CD68 was
performed in the ischemic hemisphere, followed by quantification
of MPO+ and CD8+ cells in the ischemic penumbra and the core
(Figure 8C and 8F). Immunostaining for both antigens was more
intense in the ischemic core than in the penumbra for all five rat
groups (Figure 8A, 8B, 8D, and 8E). Likewise, cell counting
revealed that the majority of MPO+ and CD68+ cells, indicative of
neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, respectively, were
present within the ischemic core. Significantly higher numbers of
MPO+ and CD68+ cells were found in both regions for group M
vs. the other four groups. But no significant differences were
detected between groups A and EA (Figure 8C and 8F). However,
the ED group showed the lowest number of infiltrating MPO+ and
CD68+ cells relative to A, EA treatment groups (Figure 8C and
8F).

Colocalization of MMP2 and AQP4 with GFAP and CD34
in the ischemic penumbra
To evaluate the astrocytic and vascular localization of MMP2
and AQP4 in the ischemic penumbra of CIRI model rats,
immunofluorescence analysis was employed using specific primary
antibodies against MMP2, AQP4, GFAP (to label astrocytes), and
CD34 (to label the endothelial cell components of blood vessels).
Figure 5 shows colocalization of MMP2 and GFAP (Figure 5A–
5C), MMP2 and CD34 (Figure 5D–5F), AQP4 and GFAP
(Figure 5G–5I), and AQP4 and CD34 (Figure 5J–5L) in MCAO
model group M. These results indicate that AQP4 and MMP2
were both expressed in astrocyte endfeet and endothelial cellderived blood vessels within the infarct area.

Discussion
Acupuncture and electroacupuncture are both potential therapeutic strategies to repair brain injury and improve functional
outcomes following acute ischemic stroke. Here, we showed that
acupuncture or electroacupuncture at Baihui (GV20) and left
Zusanli (ST36) significantly reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells and the expression of the proinflammatory enzyme,

MMP2, AQP4, and AQP9 protein expression in the

Next, we explored the hypothesis that acupuncture and
electroacupuncture can regulate MMP2, AQP4, and AQP9
expression in the ischemic penumbra and the core zone by

and others) and extracellular matter (basement membrane/
extracellular matrix and tight junctions) increase the vascular
permeability of the BBB and the uptake of abnormal quantities of
water, thereby evoking secondary brain damage. Under normal
conditions, total cessation of blood flow does not provoke
dysfunction of water homeostasis, suggesting that some residual
blood flow is required to develop brain edema [25]. Obviously,
reperfusion worsens capillary vascular damage and augments
ischemic cerebral edema. [26]. The detrimental impact of these
assorted events on BBB integrity directly results in brain edema
after stroke.
MMPs and other proteases are products of a molecular
inflammatory cascade that damages the BBB following CIRI.
BBB tight junction proteins and basal lamina proteins,which form
the endothelial barrier, are vulnerable to attack by MMPs. MMP2
is especially important in astrocytes and endothelial cells, and its
activation generally leads to a biphasic (transient and 24–48 h in
duration) opening of the BBB [27]. For this reason, agents that
protect the brain from edema by interfering with BBB are under
pursuit by many researchers. Notably, our study showed that
MMP2 colocalized with both GFAP in astrocytes and CD34 in
endothelial cells within the ischemic penumbra, strengthening the
idea that synthetic MMPs inhibitors could be used in CIRI
management [28,29]. We also showed that acupuncture and
electroacupuncture significantly reversed MMP2 upregulation in

MMP2, in CIRI model rats. Acupuncture and electroacupuncture
also significantly attenuated the expression of the water channel
proteins, AQP4 and AQP9, in the ischemic brain, suggesting that
the protective mechanisms of these alternative treatments are
partially dependent on the mitigation of inflammation-related
brain edema. Consistent with the smaller observed infarct size,
acupuncture and electroacupuncture both promoted significant
improvements in the mNSS in CIRI model rats, indicative of
enhanced neurological function.
Cerebral ischemia and edema are frequently associated with
neuroinflammation, augmented production of proinflammatory
mediators, and infiltration of inflammatory cells (e.g., MPO+
neutrophils and CD68+ monocyte/macrophages). The majority of
the infiltrating MPO+ and CD68+ cells observed in this
investigation were present within the core zone of the infarct area
after CIRI, rather than in the peri-infarct penumbra. These cells
were particularly prominent in model group M relative to the
other four experimental groups and in A and EA groups relative to
both S group. However, treatment groups A and EA showed no
significant differences between the number of infiltrating MPO+
and CD68+ cells, suggesting that acupuncture and electroacupuncture are equally effective in their amelioration of certain
aspects of inflammatory brain injury.
The BBB is critically involved in the maintenance of brain
homeostasis. In the case of CIRI, injured brain cells (microvessel/
capillary endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, neurons,

Owing to the complex and multifaceted nature of cerebral
ischemic stroke, sequential staging of therapy by a combination of
different mechanistic approaches will probably prove most useful
in stroke management. Nowadays, acupuncture has gained
increasing popularity in modern health care, garnering new
support from a myriad of scientific investigators. The popular use
of acupuncture has also inspired many scientists to explore ancient
traditional medical technology alongside conventional medicine.
Although the precise manner in which acupuncture functions is
unknown and requires further study, many researchers now claim
that acupuncture and electroacupuncture are beneficial for
treating ischemic stroke [35]. Indeed, the assorted effects of
acupuncture and electroacupuncture on the generation and
blockade of free radicals, intracellular calcium, inflammationrelated cytokines, and/or vasogenic edema have all been proposed
to explain their possible mechanisms of therapeutic action
[36,37,38,39,40].
The list of acupoints affecting the various meridians of the body
is quite long, but the Baihui (GV20), Zusanli (ST36), Neiguan
(pericardium-6, PC6), Weizhong (bladder-40, BL40), Sanyinjiao
(spleen-6, SP6), Chize (lung-5, LU5), Renzhong (governing vessel6, GV6), and Waiguan (TE5) locations are the most frequently
chosen acupoints. Special acupuncture manipulations are also

CIRI model rats, although edaravone was more effective than
either acupuncture or electroacupuncture.
AQPs, like MMP2, play essential roles in the pathogenesis of
brain edema. The MCAO model, which utilizes focal brain
ischemia to impart tissue damage, was previously reported to
increase AQP4 expression in the infarct zone shortly after the
insult [30]. On the other hand, another study suggested that
AQP4 inhibition may provide a new therapeutic option for
reducing brain edema [31]. Yet another study reported two peaks
of brain swelling following CIRI, coinciding with two peaks of
AQP4 expression in both the infarct and the peri-infarct area
[32,33].
AQP9, along with AQP4, is associated with brain damage after
CIRI. AQP9 is upregulated in the ischemic core and the lesion
border [33], with lower expression reported in the core [34]. Our
data showed elevated expression of APQ9 and AQP4 in both the
ischemic penumbra and the core, but the highest expression was
found in the core zone. We additionally demonstrated that
acupuncture, electroacupuncture, and edaravone significantly
downregulated AQP4 and AQP9 mRNA and protein levels after
CIRI, again implying that AQP4 and AQP9 work together to
cause brain edema.

relative to the control. However, electroacupuncture delivered
potentially greater benefits than acupuncture alone in terms of
neuroblast plasticity [45].
According to the results of our study, CIRI rats receiving
acupuncture at GV20 and ST36 or electroacupuncture at GV20
and ST36 with continuous-wave stimulation had better neurological scores and reduced brain infarction volumes than CIRI rats
receiving no post-operative treatment. However, no significant
differences were found between acupuncture and electroacupuncture in MMP2/AQP9 expression or the numbers of MPO+ and
CD68+ cells. In fact, the only significant difference between groups
A and EA was a tempered expression of AQP4 mRNA in group
EA. Thus, acupuncture and electroacupuncture may share the
same mechanism of neuroprotective action, with the added
stimulation of electroacupuncture conferring a slight therapeutic
advantage.
Edaravone is a free radical scavenger and the first medication
with demonstrated efficacy for cerebral ischemia [46]. Edaravone
is commonly used in China and was therefore employed as a drug
control for acupuncture and electroacupuncture in the present
study. Overall, the ED group presented with the lowest number of
infiltrating MPO+ and CD68+ cells, protein expression levels of
MMP2, AQP4, and AQP9, and mRNA expression levels of AQP4
and AQP9 relative to the other four groups. The ED group
showed improvements relative to the A and EA groups; therefore,
it is possible that the acupuncture and electroacupuncture

clinically used to improve self-care ability and quality of life in
ischemic stroke patients, including scalp acupuncture and resuscitating acupuncture [41].
Traditional Chinese Medicine theory holds that GV20 belongs
to the governing vessel, which in humans is located on the top of
the head at the intersection of the middle sagittal line and the
connection of the two ear apexes. GV20 functions to collect the
yang around the body. After stimulation of GV20, the local yang is
dispersed over and energizes the entire body. ST36 is located at
3 cm below Dubi (stomach-35, ST35) and one finger’s breadth
before the anterior crest of the tibia, and is utilized as an acupoint
for treating digestive system diseases (e.g., gastroplegia, functional
dyspepsia, and intestinal obstruction). ST36 is one of several
acupoints of the stomach meridian, which is rich in both Qi and
blood, and thus stimulation at ST36 has the capacity to modulate
the function of the entire body. Once Qi and blood are enriched,
the body can again be activated. Of relevance to the current study,
simultaneous stimulation of GV20 and ST60 reportedly has a
synergistically beneficial effect on the attenuation of brain ischemia
[42].
Electroacupuncture, which can deliver continuous stimulation
to acupoints, is currently under investigation for the management
of ischemic stroke in experimental animals and in clinical practice
[43,44]. Previous work compared the therapeutic efficacy of
acupuncture at ST36 and GV20 vs. electroacupuncture at ST36
and GV20 in rats undergoing CIRI and suggested that both
treatments significantly increased hippocampal cell proliferation

techniques explored herein will require further optimization for
maximum therapeutic efficacy.
In conclusion, the results of the present investigation indicate
that acupuncture and electroacupuncture are effective treatments
for brain tissue injury and neurological deficits following CIRI in
rats. Therefore, this study adds to the growing arsenal of research
supporting the view that acupuncture and electroacupuncture,
which are derived from Traditional Chinese Medicine, can serve

as complementary and alternative treatments to supplement the
conventional management of ischemic stroke.
