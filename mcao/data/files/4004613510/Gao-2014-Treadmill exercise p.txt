Introduction

Stroke is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and the most common cause of death in China. The
annual stroke mortality rate in China is approximately 1.6
million affecting 157 people per 100,000 and it has become
the leading cause of death and adult disability (Liu et al.,
2011). Every year there are approximately 2.5 million new
cases of stroke and 7.5 million stroke survivors in China
(Johnston et al., 2009). Currently, 7 million Chinese people
have had a stroke, and approximately 65% of them are
suffering from ischemic brain injury (Wang et al., 2011).
Unfortunately, with the exception of tissue-type plasminogen
activator, no other treatment is available to limit brain
damage following a stroke.
Treadmill running has been proposed as a possible means
of treatment for stroke patients. Clinical and experimental
studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of
exercise therapy, which include a smaller brain infarct
volume or better neurological function in stroke-induced
brain injury (Dobkin, 2004; Wolf et al., 2006; Yang et al.,
2012). Further, there is much evidence to suggest that
exercise might promote angiogenesis and increase blood
vessel density, with reduced diffusion distance in the
ischemic penumbra after ischemic brain damage (Ding
et al., 2004; Gertz et al., 2006; Matsuda et al., 2011; Zheng
et al., 2011). Recent studies have suggested that angiogenesis
in the ischemic penumbra area may play a crucial role in
neural protection and tissue recovery. Thus, treadmill exercise may be a promising approach for promoting angiogenesis and formation of new vessels after stroke. However, the
speciﬁc brain structures and mechanisms of treadmillinduced angiogenesis remain unclear.
Angiogenesis is a complex process that involves multiple
interactions among inﬂammatory cells, endothelial cells,
surrounding pericytes, the extracellular matrix, proteases
and angiogenic cytokines/growth factors. Numerous angiogenic growth factors have been implicated in promoting
recovery after ischemic stroke by enhancing angiogenesis.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most commonly studied angiogenic growth factor that plays a critical
role in new vessel growth. The expression of VEGF is
upregulated both in hypoxia (ischemia) and brain tumors
(Zhang et al., 2002; Zhang and Chopp, 2002; Ma et al., 2012).
The expression of VEGF is associated with an increase in
vascular density in the ischemic penumbra (Hansen et al.,
2008; Hermann and Zechariah, 2009), suggesting that VEGF
plays an important role in angiogenesis following brain
ischemia. VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) is the major mediator
of the effects of VEGF in brain ischemia (Lampugnani et al.,
2006). The VEGF/VEGFR-2-induced angiogenesis after cerebral
ischemia may involve a number of downstream signals,
including phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and

mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (Lafuente et al.,
2012), which in turn have numerous downstream signals.
Thus, it appears that VEGF-induced angiogenesis after
ischemic stroke is a complex process that requires further
investigation.
The caveolin-1 signaling pathway is widely known for its
role in regulating cell functions for signal transduction,
endocytosis, transcytosis, molecular transport, embryonic
vessel development, normal tissue growth, wound healing,
and pathological processes (e.g., ischemia, tumor growth; Liu
et al., 2002; Mundy et al., 2002; Navarro et al., 2004). The
importance of caveolin-1 in endothelial cells during angiogenesis has been conﬁrmed. We have previously demonstrated that treatment of rats with apigenin after stroke
enhanced the expression of both VEGF and caveolin-1 at
the brain-infarct border zone, and that the expression of
caveolin-1 was in line with the improved functional recovery
(Li et al., 2010; Niu et al., 2010). Other studies have demonstrated that genetic ablation of the Cav-1 gene in mice results
in increased cerebral infarct volume, impaired angiogenesis,
decreased expression of VEGF and increased apoptotic cell
death (Jasmin et al., 2007; Chidlow and Sessa, 2010). These
studies suggest that caveolin-1 may reduce infarct volumes
and promote angiogenesis after cerebral ischemia through
the VEGF signaling pathway.
Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that caveolin-1
may also be involved in exercise-induced angiogenesis and
improvement of neurologic functional recovery after stroke.
To explore this hypothesis and elucidate the mechanisms
involved in exercise-induced angiogenesis, we examined the
expression of VEGF and microvessel density in the ischemic
penumbra, and neurological outcome in rats after middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with the caveolin-1 inhibitor, daidzein.

Results

2.1.

Neurological status

A ﬁve-point neurological scale revealed that sham rats had
no neurological symptoms. The rats exposed to ischemia
followed by 7 or 28 days of exercise demonstrated signiﬁcantly better neurological statuses (1.05670.236 and
0.55670.254, respectively) compared with the rats exposed
to ischemia without exercise (2.05670.236 [7 days] and
0.77870.428 [28 days], po0.05). The rats exposed to ischemia
followed by 7 or 28 days of daidzein injections demonstrated
signiﬁcantly worse neurological statuses (2.86970.531 and
1.57470.476, respectively) compared with the rats exposed to
ischemia (2.05670.236 and 0.77870.428, po0.05 at 7 days and
at 28 days after exercise, respectively). The neurological

brain research 1585 (2014) 83–90

scores in group IEM (inhibitor, exercise and model) decreased
signiﬁcantly at 7 and 28 days after exercise and daidzein
injections (1.94770.369 and 0.82570.374) compared with
those in the inhibitor model group (IM group: 2.86970.531
and 1.57470.476, po0.05 at 7 and 28 days after exercise and
daidzein injections, respectively).

2.2.

Cerebral infarct volume

None of the sham rats had cerebral infarcts. Rats in the
exercise, model group (EM group) at 7 and 28 days showed
signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume (12.800%73.592 and
6.535%72.698) compared with those in the model only group
(group M: 37.566%74.842 and 9.488%72.929, po0.05 at 7 days
and at 28 days after exercise, respectively; Fig. 1). After 7 and
28 days of daily daidzein injections, the rats in group IM
demonstrated signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume (47.450%
76.732 and 16.283%73.220), compared with the rats in group
M (37.566%74.842 and 9.488%72.929, po0.05 at 7 days and at
28 days after daidzein injections, respectively; Fig. 1). The
infarct volumes of rats in group IEM were reduced signiﬁcantly at 7 and 28 days (34.183%75.312 and 9.433%75.637,
respectively), compared with those of rats in group IM

(47.450%76.732 and 16.283%73.220, po0.05 at 7 and 28 days
after exercise and daidzein injections, respectively; Fig. 1).

2.3.
Caveolin-1 and VEGF protein expression in the
ischemic penumbra
We used Western blot analysis to quantify the protein
expression levels of caveolin-1 and VEGF after MCAO in this
model. Cytoplasmic proteins were used for the detection of
caveolin-1 and VEGF. Total protein was isolated using the
same brains at 7 and 28 days after MCAO in the rat ischemic
penumbra (n ¼7 in each group). Our results showed that one
band of 42 kDa, corresponding to VEGF protein, obviously
peaked at 7 days, and then declined at 28 days in EM rats
compared with M rats or sham controls (Fig. 2A). After
normalization with β-tubulin, there was approximately a
2.0-fold increase of VEGF protein at 7 days (po0.05, Fig. 2A).
Meanwhile, we found that one band of 21 kDa, corresponding
to the total caveolin-1 protein, was obviously enhanced
compared with the sham controls at 7 days, and then
declined at 28 days in EM rats compared with M rats or sham
controls (Fig. 2A). After normalization to -tubulin, there was
approximately a 3.1-fold increase of caveolin-1 protein at 7
days (po0.05, Fig. 2A).
To investigate further whether the cavelin-1 pathway was
involved in the regulation of treadmill-induced VEGF expression, a caveolin-1 speciﬁc inhibitor, daidzein, was used. Total
protein was isolated from the penumbra of daidzein-treated
rats, and the expression levels of caveolin-1 and VEGF were
detected by Western blotting. We found that total expression
of VEGF was signiﬁcantly inhibited in IM rats compared with
that in M rats (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, VEGF expression in IEM
rats was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with that in IM rats
(Fig. 2B). After normalization with β-tubulin, there was a
25.6% decrease in caveolin-1 and a 41.2% decrease in VEGF
protein in the IEM group (po0.01) compared with the EM
group at 7 and 28 days (Fig. 2B).

Blood vessel density in the ischemic penumbra

CD34/Flk-1-immunocytochemistry was used to label brain
microvessels. Quantitative analysis of cortical and striatal
angiogenesis was assessed by counting CD34/Flk-1-immunostained microvessels. The number of immune-labeled vessels
per unit area was estimated by the ratio of the number of grown
capillaries in the same area. In the exercise groups, many blood
vessels were intensively marked by CD34/Flk-1 double labeling
in the brain ischemic penumbra of animals in the EM group
compared with the sparsely labeled vessels in the same brain
regions of rats in group M (Fig. 3). In rats from the IEM group,
fewer blood vessels were marked by CD34/Flk-1 double labeling
compared with the same brain regions of rats in the EM group
(Fig. 3). Continuous treadmill exercise for 7 days signiﬁcantly
increased blood vessel density but did not further enhance the
density induced after 28 days of exercise in the penumbra of
rats from group EM compared with that of those from group M
(po0.05).

Discussion

The beneﬁcial effects of treadmill running on brain ischemia
have been shown to reduce brain infarction, induce angiogenesis and improve long-term outcome, which is a common
phenomenon in stroke patients (Dobkin, 2004; Wolf et al., 2006;
Yang et al., 2012; Gertz et al., 2006; Matsuda et al., 2011; Zheng
et al., 2011). Caveolin-1 plays an important role in the mechanisms of cellular repair in many pathologic conditions, including
stroke (Liu et al., 2002; Mundy et al., 2002; Navarro et al., 2004).
Previous studies, including our own, have demonstrated that
ischemia/reperfusion results in increased caveolin-1 protein
expression in association with increased microvessel density
and better outcome (Li et al., 2010; Niu et al., 2010; Jasmin et al.,
2007; Chidlow and Sessa, 2010). Therefore, the role of caveolin1 in treadmill-induced angiogenesis has become interesting in
understanding the mechanisms of MCAO.
In this study, we measured caveolin-1 activity using
Western blot assays, and showed, for the ﬁrst time, that the
caveolin-1 pathway is involved in regulating VEGF in the rat
cerebral ischemic penumbra induced by treadmill exercise.
First, we found that both caveolin-1 and VEGF expression
peaked at 7 days induced by treadmill exercise and the
expression of caveolin-1 and VEGF were in line with the
promoted neurological outcome of decreased infarct volumes
and increased microvessel density. Second, we found that the
improved neurological outcome, decreased infarct volumes,
increased microvessel density, and increased expression of
VEGF induced by treadmill exercise could be signiﬁcantly
inhibited by the caveolin-1 inhibitor, daidzein.

VEGF is widely accepted to be an important determinant
in angiogenesis and plays important roles in MCAO by
functioning in promoting angiogenesis and neuroprotection
(Zhang and Chopp, 2002; Hansen et al., 2008; Hermann and
Zechariah, 2009; Ma et al., 2012). We found that the induction
of VEGF could be signiﬁcantly inhibited by daidzein, suggesting a close relationship between the caveolin-1 pathway and
VEGF cascade in rats after MCAO. Our ﬁndings of caveolin-1
upregulation in the rat model were in agreement with
previous reports (Jasmin et al., 2007).
Additionally, the microvessel density was increased at 28
days, but there was no signiﬁcant difference in the IEM group
compared with rats in the IM group. However, this result was not
in line with improved neurological outcome, decreased infarct
volume and upregulation of caveolin-1 and VEGF protein. This
indicates that caveolin-1/VEGF pathways might also be involved
in other neuroprotective effects of exercise. Recent studies have
suggested that caveolin-1 and VEGF are survival-promoting
factors similar to brain-derived neurotrophic factor in neurons,
and are thought to protect neurons and promote neurogenesis
from ischemic insults (Wang et al., 2007a, 2007b). These results
indicate that the caveolin-1/VEGF pathway may also participate
in neurogenesis effects after brain ischemia induced by treadmill
exercise.
Our current study has some limitations. First, although we
have shown that treadmill running alters caveolin-1 activity,
suggesting the importance of caveolin-1 in the protective
effects of treadmill exercise against stroke, the caveolin-1  / 
rat is not available for further study to corroborate these
ﬁndings. Second, we investigated only two time points (7 and

brain research 1585 (2014) 83–90

87

treadmill-induced neovascularization after ischemic stroke is
a complex process that involves many key factors and much
remains to be understood.

Conclusion

We demonstrated that treadmill exercise in a rat MCAO
model promotes neurological recovery, decreases brain
infarction and enhances the angiogenesis at least partly
through the modulation of upregulation of the caveolin-1/
VEGF signaling pathway. It is plausible that exercise might
also exert neuroprotective effects in stroke patients and
contribute to their functional recovery by other mechanisms
including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) or basic ﬁbroblast
growth factor (bFGF); however, further exploration of these
potential mechanisms is now needed.

28 days) after stroke. Other studies have shown that treadmill
running induces overexpression of angiogenic factors such as
VEGF and angiopoietin and their receptors, which play a key
role in new vessel growth after stroke (Ding et al., 2004;
Hansen et al., 2008; Hermann and Zechariah, 2009; Zheng
et al., 2011). Thus, treadmill exercise may promote angiogenesis through the caveolin-1 pathway. To understand the
neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of treadmill exercise
fully, future studies should include a series of experiments with
multiple pharmacological and genetic approaches using in vivo
and in vitro models.
In summary, treadmill exercise strongly limits the
ischemic insult and improves functional outcome and recovery after MCAO in a model that mimics a large portion of
human stroke cases. Our data suggest novel evidence for the
potential of treadmill exercise for the treatment of stroke,
and that caveolin-1/VEGF activity is upregulated in association with angiogenesis in the ischemic penumbra. However,

Experimental procedures

5.1.

Animals

Three-month old adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (n ¼151),
weighing 250–270 g at the time of surgery, were studied. All
the rats were randomized into ﬁve groups: sham-operated (S,
n¼ 7); model group (M, n¼ 36); exercise and model (EM, n¼ 36);
inhibitor and model (IM, n¼ 36); inhibitor, exercise and model
(IEM, n ¼36). All rats were socially housed (2–3 rats per cage)
in the same animal care facility and maintained under a 12-h
reverse light/dark cycle with water and food available ad
libitum. Animals were cared for in accordance with the
guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda,
MD). All study procedures were approved by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of Wenzhou Medical University. All
efforts were made to minimize the suffering of animals and
the number of animals used.

5.2.

Surgical procedures

Animals were anesthetized with 4% chloral hydrate. Rectal
temperature was monitored throughout the operation and
maintained at 37 1C with a circulating heating pad. The model
of left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) leading to
focal cerebral ischemia was induced with an intraluminal
ﬁlament as described by Longa et al. (1989). The reliability and
effectiveness of the ischemia stroke model was assured by
using poly-L-lysine-coated intraluminal sutures, which yield
consistently large infarcts and greatly reduce inter-animal
variability (Belayev et al., 1996). A 4–0 monoﬁlament nylon
suture, coated with poly-L-lysine (ﬁlaments 0.26 mm in
diameter were used for occlusion), was gently inserted into
the lumen of the internal carotid artery until it reached the
narrow proximal anterior cerebral artery. After 2 h of MCAO,
reperfusion was effected by withdrawal of the suture until
the tip cleared the lumen of the external carotid artery. The
rats were killed 7 and 28 days after MCAO, and the impaired
cortical areas were extracted for subsequent biochemical
analysis. Sham control animals were subjected to an identical
operation without MCAO. After recovery from anesthesia,

88

brain research 1585 (2014) 83–90

the ischemic rats was then measured with an image analyzer
Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA).
The total measured infarct volume (MV) for each brain was
calculated by summation of the infarcted area of all the brain
slices. Thus, the left hemisphere volume (LV) and right
hemisphere volume (RV) were also measured and calculated.
To minimize the error introduced by brain edema on MV in
the ischemic hemisphere, an indirect method for calculating
infarct volume was used, as previously described (Park et al.,
2006). The infarct volume was calculated as [LV(RV MV)]/
LV  100%.

Fig. 4 – Experimental design. Rats in the group EM and IEM
were forced to run on a motor-driven treadmill (30 min/day,

evaluations, all rats were sacriﬁced for

The photo shows the apparatus used in this study.
all rats were kept in individual cages for the ﬁrst 24 postoperative hours. Rats were then returned to their cages with
free access to food and water for the remainder of the
1- or 4-week period. The experimental design is shown in Fig. 4.

5.3.

Injection of the caveolin-1 inhibitor

Rats in the IM and IEM groups received an intraperitoneal (IP)
injection of daidzein (0.4 mg/kg; Ajmani et al., 2011; Sharma
et al., 2012) every 24 h following reperfusion. Rats in groups S,
M, and EM were injected with an equal volume of normal
saline (NS) at the same time following reperfusion. The rats
were then either exercised on the treadmill or remained
relatively inactive. Rats were killed at 7 and 28 days after
the operation.

5.4.

Exercise training

A motor-driven treadmill (ZH-PT Treadmill, Huaibei Zhenghua Bio Equipment Co., Ltd., Anhui, China) was used for
exercise training. Before the MCAO procedure, rats in the
treadmill group were adapted to running on the treadmill for
10 min/day, over a 3-day accommodation period. Twentyfour hours after the MCAO procedure, rats were trained to run
on the treadmill (20 m/min) for 30 min/day, 5 days/week with
a 01 slope for a period of 1 or 4 weeks (Jia et al., 2009).

5.5.

TTC staining

TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl-2h-tetrazolium chloride) was used to
estimate the extent of brain infarct. After 1 or 4 weeks of
training, animals were deeply anesthetized with 4% chloral
hydrate (10 mL/kg, IP). After intracardiac perfusion with
200 mL of 0.9% NaCl, the brains were quickly removed and
coronally sectioned into 2-mm-thick slices using a brain
slicer. Each fresh brain slice was immersed in 2% TTC at
37 1C for 30 min, and then ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde in
0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 1C. The infarct volume in

Behavioral testing

All behavioral tests were performed at 7 and 28 days after
intervention. Neurological examination was performed
before killing. A modiﬁed neurologic grading system with a
ﬁve-point scale (0–5) developed by Longa et al. (1989) was
used: 0¼ no deﬁcits; 1¼ unable to extend the right forelimb;
2 ¼decreased grip of the right forelimb while tail pulled;
3¼mild circling, right circling only if pulled by tail;
4¼spontaneous right circling; and 5¼falling to the contralateral
side.

5.7.

Western blot analysis

Rats were sacriﬁced at 7 or 28 days after reperfusion (n ¼7 per
group). The brains were removed quickly and the tissue
corresponding to the peri-ischemic cortex was dissected for
Western blot analysis. The peri-ischemic cortex was deﬁned
as tissue immediately adjacent to the infarct core in the left
cortex and was dissected using a method described previously (Fig. 5; Ashwal et al., 1998). The corresponding region
from sham-operated rats was also dissected as the nonischemic control.
The isolated cortices were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA
buffer (50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0; 150 mM NaCl; 1% NP-40;
0.5% deoxycholate; and 0.1% SDS). Equal amounts (40 μg) of
total protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 8–12% Ready
Gel Tris–HCl gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein bands
were transferred from the gel to Hybond-LFP PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare Bioscience, Arlington Heights, IL, USA).
The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature with
rotation. Immunostaining of the blots was performed using a
rabbit polyclonal antibody to caveolin-1 (1:1000, #sc-894,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and rabbit
polyclonal antibody to VEGF (1:1000, #ab46145, AbCam, Cambridge, UK). The immunoreactive bands were developed with
an enhanced chemi-luminescence system (ECL kit, Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). The membranes were also

(1:2000, T 2200, Sigma, SL, USA) followed by peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG
(1:10,000, EarthOx, LLC) to conﬁrm equal loading of protein.
The bands were computer-processed into binary images
using the appropriate threshold. The speciﬁc value (density  area) was obtained from each band with subsequent
correction to the β-tubulin band. The values for caveolin-1

Angiogenesis in the ischemic penumbra was examined
using a TS100 Inverted Biological Microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Speciﬁcally, ﬁve coronal sections every
200 μm were collected from each rat and the number of CD34/
Flk-1-positive cells in the ischemic penumbra was counted in
each of the ﬁve highly magniﬁed ﬁelds; the averages in the
sample area were calculated with Image-Pro Plus analysis
software.

Statistical analysis

Data were expressed as the mean7SEM. The comparison of
infarct volumes, behavior test and expression levels of
caveolin-1 and VEGF protein were made by 2-way analysis
of variance. Statistical differences between two groups were
analyzed with post-hoc Tukey’s protected t test. Pearson’s
test was used to analyze the correlation between the expression of caveolin-1 protein in the ischemic penumbra and the
neurological outcome. The level of statistical signiﬁcance was
set at po0.05.

Fig. 5 – Percent area of brain ischemia was indirectly
estimated with the use of TTC staining. The coronal sections
at 3 and 7 mm posterior to the frontal lobe were dissected.
Tissues of the penumbra marked represented the red zone
near the infarct core area in the ipsilateral hemisphere. (For

and VEGF of the rat brain ischemic penumbra were used for
subsequent statistical analyses.

Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry was performed by the indirect
immunoperoxidase method. The brains were immersed in
4% formaldehyde at 4 1C for 24 h and then in 30% sucrose for
48 h at 4 1C. Ten-μm frozen brain sections were prepared for
immunohistochemistry. For CD34/Flk-1 double-immunostaining, sections were incubated overnight at 4 1C with
primary antibody (endothelia progenitor cell marker, rabbit
anti-CD34 antibody, 1:200, sc-7045, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA; or mouse anti-Flk-1 antibody, 1:200,
sc-6251, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Sections were post-ﬁxed with buffered 4% formaldehyde for
30 min. After three rinses (10 min each) with 50 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.6), the sections were blocked
with 3% normal goat serum for 20 min at room temperature,
and were then individually incubated at 4 1C overnight before
being washed three times for 5 min in PBS. Sections were
incubated with primary antibody at 4 1C overnight and
washed three times in PBS. Then sections were then incubated with corresponding FITC/TRITC-conjugated secondary
antibodies (1:500, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at 37 1C.
