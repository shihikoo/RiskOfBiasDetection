Abstract
Stroke is a devastating clinical condition for which an effective
neuroprotective treatment is currently unavailable. S-allyl
cysteine (SAC), the most abundant organosulfur compound
in aged garlic extract, has been reported to possess neuroprotective effects against stroke. However, the mechanisms
underlying its beneﬁcial effects remain poorly deﬁned. The
present study tests the hypothesis that SAC attenuates
ischemic neuronal injury by activating the nuclear factor
erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant
response in both in vitro and in vivo models. Our ﬁndings
demonstrate that SAC treatment resulted in an increase in
Nrf2 protein levels and subsequent activation of antioxidant
response element pathway genes in primary cultured neurons

and mice. Exposure of primary neurons to SAC provided
protection against oxygen and glucose deprivation-induced
oxidative insults. In wild-type (Nrf2+/+) mice, systemic administration of SAC attenuated middle cerebral artery occlusioninduced ischemic damage, a protective effect not observed in
Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 / ) mice. Taken together, these ﬁndings
provide the ﬁrst evidence that activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant
response by SAC is strongly associated with its neuroprotective effects against experimental stroke and suggest that
targeting the Nrf2 pathway may provide therapeutic beneﬁt for
the treatment of stroke.

Stroke is a signiﬁcant neurological illness with few effective
treatments. To date, intravenous administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was the only
established therapy for ischemic stroke. However, it beneﬁts
only a small part of patients because its time window of
efﬁcacy is rather limited. Furthermore, reperfusion may
trigger oxidative stress. Therefore, it is necessary to ﬁnd
alternative therapies for ischemia/reperfusion damage,
including strategies that alleviate reactive oxygen speciesmediated neuronal insults.
Although oxidative stress plays a critical role in the
pathogenesis of ischemic/reperfusion brain injury, several
antioxidative drugs that target scavenging free radicals have
failed in clinical trials. As one of the master regulators of
endogenous antioxidant defenses, the transcription factor
nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor (Nrf2) is considered
to be a novel and important regulatory pathway that confers
protection in response to a variety of oxidative stress-related

SAC attenuates ischemic injury by activating Nrf2

insults. Increasing evidence suggests that Nrf2 is involved in
cerebral ischemic disease and thus may be a promising target
for the treatment of stroke (Alﬁeri et al. 2011). This is further
corroborated as several studies highlight the ability of drugs
or natural plant-derived compounds to protect against stroke
via activation of the Nrf2 pathway (Shah et al. 2010; Zhang
et al. 2012; Alﬁeri et al. 2013).
The organosulfur molecule S-allyl cysteine (SAC) is the
most abundant compound of aged garlic extract (AGE) and
exhibits a wide range of antioxidant properties. Several
studies have shown that SAC ameliorates the oxidative
damage of experimental stroke (Numagami et al. 1996;
Atif et al. 2009; Ashafaq et al. 2012). However, the
antioxidant mechanism underlying the protective effect of
SAC against experimental stroke is currently unknown. As
numerous antioxidants have broad-spectrum protective
properties, including stimulation of the transcription factor
Nrf2, we hypothesize that SAC might have similar actions.
Thus, we undertook this study to investigate the potential
neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanism of SAC
against ischemic/reperfusion brain injury. Our novel evidence is presented to demonstrate that SAC conferred
neuroprotection by activating the antioxidant Nrf2 signaling
pathway.

Materials and methods
Animals and reagents
Nrf2 heterozygous mice (Nrf2+/ ) were purchased from the Jackson
laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Nrf2 knockout (Nrf2 / ) and
wild-type (Nrf2+/+) mice were obtained by breeding Nrf2+/ mice.
Primary cultures of cortical neurons were dissected from embryonic
day 17 fetal rats. All experiments were approved by the institutional
Animal care and Use committee of Shandong University. SAC was
purchased from Sigma/Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Neurobasal
A media and B27 supplement were purchased from Invitrogen/
Gibco (Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Primary culture and in vitro model of cerebral ischemia
Primary cortical neuron cultures were prepared from day 17
Sprague–Dawley rat embryos and maintained in Neurobasal A
medium supplemented with B27, as described previously (Gan
et al. 2012). Experiments were performed 7 days after seeding.
Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was used to model the ischemia-like conditions in vitro. Cortical neurons pre-treated with SAC
(10, 25, 50 lM) for 2 h were subjected to OGD for 60 min, and
then returned to normal culture media supplied with the same
concentration of SAC.
Cell death/viability assessment in primary cultured neurons
Cells seeded in 96-well plate were pre-treated with SAC at the
indicated concentrations for 2 h before being exposed to OGD for
60 min and incubated with SAC for an additional 24 h. Cell
viability was quantiﬁed using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and by random blinded cell
counting of Hoechst 33258-stained cell nuclei 24 h after OGD.

299

OGD-induced cell death was quantiﬁed by measuring lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) release from damaged cells into the culture
medium using a kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Cat. No. 04744926001, Roche Diagnostic, Indianapolis, IN, USA).
All data were expressed as percentage of LDH release compared
with the control group.
Cellular extract preparation, Nrf2 activity assay and western blot
analysis
Nuclear extracts and whole-cell extracts from primary cultured
neurons and mice brain tissues were prepared as described previously
(Jing et al. 2013). Protein concentrations were determined by the
bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce, Rockford IL, USA). TransAMâ
Nrf2 assay (Cat. No. 50296; Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was
used to measure Nrf2 DNA-binding activity according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Western blotting was performed as
described previously (Jing et al. 2013). Brieﬂy, Protein samples were
resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed using appropriate primary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were
utilized for western blot analysis: Nrf2, heme oxygenase-1(HO-1),
glutathione cysteine ligase regulatory subunit (GCLC), glutathione
cysteine ligase modulatory subunit (GCLM) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), cleaved caspase-3, phosp-c-Jun Nterminal kinase (p-JNK), total JNK, phospho-p38 (p-p38), total p38
and Histone H3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA).
The signals from horseradish peroxidase-conjugated-secondary antibodies were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce).
The densitometric analysis of the bands was performed using ImageJ
software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Gene transfection in primary cultured neurons by viral vectors
Primary cultured neurons were infected with non-speciﬁc scrambled
or Nrf2 shRNA lentiviral particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at
day 6 in vitro at a concentration of 2.0 9 105 infectious units of
virus (IFU) in complete medium containing polybrene (5 lg/mL).
Cells were then subjected to OGD or SAC treatment 4 days after
infection (day 10 in vitro) as described previously (Cheng et al.
2011).
Model of cerebral ischemia
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced in
12-week-old male Nrf2 / and Nrf2+/+ mice as described previously
(Gan et al. 2012). Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized with 10% chloral
hydrate. A silicon-coated 8.0 monoﬁlament suture was introduced
into the internal carotid artery through the external carotid artery
stump, and wedged into the circle of Willis to obstruct the origin of
the MCA (Middle cerebral artery). After 2 h of MCAO, the suture
was carefully removed to restore blood ﬂow. Rectal temperature was
maintained at 37°C during and after the surgery via a homeothermic
blanket. After 24 h of reperfusion, mice were anesthetized and
decapitated. The sham groups were applied to the same procedures
except without the MCA occlusion.
Neurological deficit score and infarct volume assessment
Stroke outcomes were assessed using a 4-tiered neurological scoring
system as described previously (Mocco et al. 2006). To calculate
the infarct volume, brains which were removed 24 h after MCAO

neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus as previously
described (Zhang et al. 2011).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (Gan
et al. 2012). In brief, the 4 lm thick parafﬁn sections, were ﬁrstly

deparafﬁnized in xylene, rehydrated with different grades of ethanol,
and pre-treated with 0.2% Triton-X 100 for 15 min at 37°C (to
permeate the nucleus). The sections were then incubated in 5%
albumin from bovine serum to block the non-speciﬁc binding of
immunoglobulins for 20 min. Then the sections were incubated in
the midst of anti-Nrf2 antibody (1 : 50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
at 4°C overnight. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at 20°C. Immunostaining was
visualized after diaminobenzidine staining (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) using bright ﬁeld microscopy (Olympus,
Japan).

Results
SAC activates Nrf2 and its downstream genes in primary
cortical neurons
To determine if SAC has the ability to activate Nrf2
signaling, we treated primary neurons with SAC and
measured nuclear Nrf2 protein levels by western blot. When
cells were exposed to SAC for 8 h, endogenous Nrf2 protein
levels increased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). Next,

the time-dependent induction of Nrf2 by SAC was evaluated
using a 50 lM dose. A signiﬁcant increase in Nrf2 protein
level was observed as early as 2 h and persisted for up to
24 h after SAC treatment (Fig. 1b).
We next determined if SAC could induce the expression of
endogenous Nrf2 target genes, such as HO-1, GCLC, and
GCLM. As shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d), exposure of cells to

SAC strongly induced HO-1, GCLC, and GCLM protein
expression in primary cortical neurons.
To detect if SAC enhanced Nrf2 transcriptional activity,
we incubated primary neurons either with different concentrations of SAC for 8 h or with 50 lM SAC for different
lengths of time and then extracted the nuclear fractions.

Nrf2 at the protein level in response to SAC, the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 was also induced by SAC treatment
(Fig. 1e and f).

Nrf2 / mice were used in the following study. Mice were
pre-treated with 300 mg/kg SAC intraperitoneally 30 min
before the onset of MCAO. First, we showed that systemic
administration of SAC is effective at upregulating protein
levels of Nrf2 and Nrf2 target genes in Nrf2+/+ mice but not
Nrf2 / mice, as measured by both immunohistochemistry
(Fig. 4a) and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4b–e). As shown in
Fig. 4(a), protein levels of Nrf2 in the MCAO group were
increased compared to the sham group for Nrf2+/+ mice,
while in the SAC-treated group it increased signiﬁcantly
compared with the MCAO group. As expected, Nrf2 levels
were not affected by SAC treatment in Nrf2 / mice.
Immunoblot analysis conﬁrmed increased protein levels of
Nrf2 and Nrf2 target genes in the cerebral cortex (Fig. 4b and
c) and hippocampus (Fig. 4d and e) of Nrf2+/+ mice after
SAC treatment.
Next, we investigated if SAC could protect mice from
ischemic reperfusion injury induced by focal cerebral
ischemia. The neurological deﬁcit scores and the degree of
brain damage (infarct volume) were assessed 24 h after
reperfusion. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), both the infarct
volumes and the neurological deﬁcit scores were signiﬁcantly less than those in the vehicle-treated mice at 24 h after
reperfusion in SAC-treated Nrf2+/+ mice, while no improvement was observed in SAC-treated Nrf2 / mice. Next,
hematoxylin and eosin staining and cresyl violet staining
were used to show morphological changes of injured neurons
(Fig. 5c and d) in ischemia-induced neuronal injury. We
found that SAC treatment signiﬁcantly improved neuronal
survival and retention of Nissl substance in Nrf2+/+ but not in
Nrf2 / mice. Taken together, these results strongly demonstrate that SAC protected against cerebral ischemia by
activating the Nrf2 pathway.
The protective effect of SAC against cerebral ischemic
injury was further conﬁrmed by TUNEL staining of brain
sections 24 h after MCAO (Fig. 6a). Only occasional
TUNEL-positive cells were seen in the sham group. Compared to the sham group, the number of TUNEL-positive
cells was signiﬁcantly reduced by SAC treatment in Nrf2+/+
mice, whereas the protective effect of SAC was not obvious
in Nrf2 / mice. These results strongly indicate that SAC
protected against experimental stroke through activation of
the Nrf2-dependent defensive mechanisms.
Considering the importance of the JNK and p38 signaling
pathways to ischemic neuronal death and our observations
that SAC provided neuroprotection in vitro, we further

SAC protects primary cortical neurons from OGD-induced
cytotoxicity
Activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway is known to confer
resistance of cells to oxidative stress (Yang et al. 2011; Zhai
et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2014a). To test the ability of SAC to
prevent oxidative stress-induced cell death, we ﬁrst performed the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and LDH release assay after challenging
neuron cultures with OGD. Compared to vehicle-treated
control cells, pre-treatment of cells with SAC signiﬁcantly
reduced OGD-associated cell death as well as LDH release in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a and b). This was further
conﬁrmed by Hoechst 33258 staining (Fig. 2c) and TUNEL
staining (Fig. 2d).
We further determined the effect of SAC treatment on the
JNK/p38 MAPK pathway, the main signaling pathway that
contributes to ischemic neuronal death (Gan et al. 2012). As
illustrated (Fig. 2e), SAC treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of both JNK and p38 and subsequently inhibited the
activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-3 after OGD exposure.
The protective effect of SAC is mediated by Nrf2 signaling in
primary cortical neurons subjected to OGD
To verify that the protective effect afforded by SAC requires
Nrf2 activation, Nrf2 gene silencing was used. The efﬁciency
of the Nrf2 shRNA in knocking down Nrf2 was conﬁrmed
by western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), the
Nrf2 shRNA treatment signiﬁcantly reduced Nrf2 level in
nuclear extracts from neuronal cells treated with SAC, and
decreased the upregulation of its downstream genes, HO-1,
GCLC, and GCLM. We next exposed scrambled or Nrf2
shRNA-treated cells to 50 lM SAC and then subjected them
to OGD. The results showed that knockdown of Nrf2
signiﬁcantly blocked the protective effects of SAC (Fig. 3c–
e), indicating a contribution of Nrf2 to SAC-dependent
protection against oxidative stress in primary neurons.

investigated the role of oxidative stress-induced apoptotic
signaling cascades in vivo after MCAO. Consistent with our
in vitro results (see Fig. 2e above), MCAO increased p-JNK
and p-p38 protein levels in ischemic cortex of the mice 24 h
after MCAO. SAC pre-treatment signiﬁcantly decreased
MCAO-induced activation of JNK and p38 signaling pathways in Nrf2+/+ mice, yet this effect was not observed in
Nrf2 / mice (Fig. 6b).

Discussion
In the present study, we identiﬁed important mechanisms
underlying the neuroprotective effects of SAC both in vitro
and in vivo. The ﬁndings support a reactive oxygen species
scavenging effect, as noted by others, that occurs by
stimulating Nrf2 transcription and its downstream antioxidant pathways. This is supported by several lines of
evidence. We showed that SAC-activated Nrf2 in vitro and
in vivo (Figs 1 and 4) and protected primary cultured cortical
neurons from OGD insults (Fig. 2). Our in vivo studies in
MCAO mice demonstrated that SAC ameliorated cerebral
ischemia-induced damage, an effect that was abolished in
Nrf2 / mice. These data imply that SAC mediates neuro-

protection by activating Nrf2 transcription. Our data further
imply that targeting the Nrf2/antioxidant response element
pathway is a promising approach for therapeutic intervention
in stroke.
Others have shown that pharmacological agents that
activate Nrf2 may be able to block changes associated with
stroke in different model systems (Shah et al. 2010; Zhang
et al. 2012, 2014a,b; Alﬁeri et al. 2013; Zhai et al. 2013),
and our data are consistent with these previous reports. The
protective effect of SAC has been observed in ischemia
models, and SAC-afforded neuroprotection is thought to be
due to its antioxidant properties (Atif et al. 2009; Ashafaq
et al. 2012). However, the neuroprotective effect of SAC
against ischemic/reperfusion could not be fully interpreted by
its antioxidant action alone. Prior to our ﬁndings, there was
no information on Nrf2 induction by SAC in the brain.
Compared with previous reports, we are thus the ﬁrst to
testify that SAC exhibit the neuroprotective effects by
activating Nrf2 and stimulating the downstream antioxidant
response element gene expression.
The neuroprotective mechanisms of SAC are not fully
understood, although antioxidant effect has been reported to be
contributing factors. For example, SAC was known to

SAC attenuates ischemic injury by activating Nrf2

scavenge superoxide anion (O2 ), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),
hydroxyl radical (OH), and peroxynitrite anion (ONOO )
(Ide and Lau 1999a,b; Kim et al. 2001, 2006; Numagami and
Ohnishi 2001; Maldonado et al. 2003; Medina-Campos et al.
2007). However, these factors may not comprise the entire
extent of protective mechanisms. Our present study revealed
that the antioxidant role of SAC is dependent on its ability to
activate Nrf2, a master transcription factor that governs phase
two enzyme expression. Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is not
active because it binds to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1
(Keap1), which facilities their proteasomal degradation,
resulting in a short half-life and a low basal level of Nrf2. A
recent study shows that SAC itself may promote dissociation
of Keap1 from Nrf2. This may occur if SAC acts with thiol
groups on the cysteine residues of Keap1 to release Nrf2 from
Keap1, preventing their entry into the ubiquitination pathway
(Tobon-Velasco et al. 2012), although direct evidence for this
is not available now.
While the current study focuses on Nrf2, it does not exclude
the possibility that SAC may exhibit its neuroprotective effects
through other mechanisms. Further investigations are still
required to elucidate the precise protective mechanisms
exerted by this antioxidant in several toxic models.
There is an increasing clinical interest in using Nrf2
activators for therapeutic purposes. One way to activate the
Nrf2 pathway is using drugs that are already used in clinic that
can activate the Nrf2 pathway. AGE is a commercially
available garlic preparation that has been widely studied for its
high antioxidant and health-protective effects (Ide and Lau
1999a,b, 2001; Borek 2001; Kim et al. 2001). As the most
abundant component in AGE, SAC has been revealed to have
antioxidant properties in several studies (Mostafa et al. 2000;
Numagami and Ohnishi 2001; Peng et al. 2002). Compared
with other Nrf2 activators such as 2-cyano-3,12 dioxooleana1,9 dien-28-oyl imidazoline (CDDO-Im) (Zhang et al. 2012)
that has previously been shown to have neuroprotective
effects, the advantage of SAC is that it can readily cross the
blood-brain barrier and is much less toxic than other antioxidants (Colın-Gonzalez et al. 2012). Therefore, the potency of
SAC and its lack of toxicity make it a promising candidate for
clinical neuroprotection. The potential beneﬁt of SAC in the
central nervous system is not limited to stroke. For examples,
SAC also protects against Parkinson’s disease (Garcia et al.
2008; Garcıa et al. 2010, 2014; Rojas et al. 2011; Tob
onVelasco et al. 2012), Alzheimer’s disease (Nishiyama et al.
2001; Peng et al. 2002; Ito et al. 2003; Kosuge et al. 2003;
Perez-Severiano et al. 2004; Ishige et al. 2007; Ray et al.
2011), and Huntington’s diseases (Herrera-Mundo et al. 2006;
Perez-De La Cruz et al. 2006). In the future studies, the
neuroprotective effects of SAC could be extended to other
forms of acute brain damage such as hemorrhagic stroke and
traumatic brain injury.
Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate a neuroprotective mechanism of SAC against experimental stroke.

Moreover, given that SAC is a potent antioxidant but less toxic
than other antioxidants, it has been suggested that this
compound might exhibit prophylactic properties at a clinical
level. It may be beneﬁcial to use SAC together with standard
therapies as a more potent neuroprotective therapy. The results
of this study also provide compelling support for ﬁnding
additional potent pharmacological agents to activate the Nrf2
pathway to add to the arsenal for treating ischemic diseases.
