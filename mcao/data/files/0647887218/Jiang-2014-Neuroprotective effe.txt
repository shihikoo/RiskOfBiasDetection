Abstract
Background: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are implicated in inflammatory and
apoptotic processes of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury. Hence, MAPK pathways represent a promising
therapeutic target. Exploring the full potential of inhibitors of MAPK pathways is a useful therapeutic strategy for
ischemic stroke. Bilobalide, a predominant sesquiterpene trilactone constituent of Ginkgo biloba leaves, has been
shown to exert powerful neuroprotective properties, which are closely related to both anti-inflammatory and
anti-apoptotic pathways. We investigated the neuroprotective roles of bilobalide in the models of middle cerebral
artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) and oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) of cerebral
I/R injury. Moreover, we attempted to confirm the hypothesis that its protection effect is via modulation of
pro-inflammatory mediators and MAPK pathways.
Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to MCAO for 2 h followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Bilobalide was
administered intraperitoneally 60 min before induction of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). After reperfusion,
neurological deficit scores, infarct volume, infarct weight, and brain edema were assessed. Ischemic penumbrae of the
cerebral cortex were harvested to determine superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide, TNF-α,
interleukin 1β (IL-1β), p-ERK1/2, p-JNK1/2, and p-p38 MAPK concentration. Similarly, the influence of bilobalide on the
expression of nitric oxide, TNF-α, IL-1β, p-ERK1/2, p-JNK1/2, and p-p38 MAPK was also observed in an OGD/R in vitro
model of I/R injury.
Results: Pretreatment with bilobalide (5, 10 mg/kg) significantly decreased neurological deficit scores, infarct volume,
infarct weight, brain edema, and concentrations of MDA, nitric oxide, TNF-α, IL-1β, and increased SOD activity.
Furthermore, bilobalide (5, 10 mg/kg) pretreatment significantly down-regulated both p-JNK1/2 and p-p38 MAPK
expression, whereas they had no effect on p-ERK1/2 expression in the ischemic penumbra. Supporting these observations
in vivo, pretreatment with bilobalide (50, 100 μM) significantly down-regulated nitric oxide, TNF-α, IL-1β, p-JNK1/2, and
p-p38 MAPK expression, but did not change p-ERK1/2 expression in rat cortical neurons after OGD/R injury.

its inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediator production and down-regulation of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation.

Background
Ischemic stroke, also known as cerebral infarction, is a
common and life-threatening cerebrovascular disease with
substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide [1,2]. Ischemic stroke due to sudden occlusion of a blood vessel by
a thrombus or embolism accounts for 87% of all stroke
cases [1]. Rapid reperfusion is critical in the treatment of
unexpected cerebral ischemic incidents. However, perhaps
surprisingly, the occurrence of post-perfusion lesions is
usually associated with exacerbation of brain injury and
a profound inflammatory response [3,4]. Although the
mechanisms of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R)
injury are complex and involve the interaction of numerous
pathophysiological processes, there is accumulating evidence that inflammation and apoptosis are involved [3-6].
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated
after focal cerebral I/R and play crucial roles in regulating
neuronal survival or damage [7-10]. The activated MAPKs
mainly function as mediators of cellular stress by phosphorylating intracellular enzymes, transcription factors, and
cytosolic proteins involved in cell survival, inflammatory
mediators production, and apoptosis [11,12]. Extracellular
signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), c-Jun NH2-terminal
kinases (JNKs), and p38 kinases are the best-known
MAPK systems. In contrast with ERK, which is part of the
survival route, the presence of JNK and p38 MAPK could
have an impact on cell injury [11]. There is a growing
body of evidence to show that p38 MAPK is activated
in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia after various types
of ischemia [13-15], and its prolonged activation is associated with neuronal apoptosis and the production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis
factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β), which are
favored by acting as perpetrators in the central nervous
system injury as well as conversely activating the p38
MAPK pathway [16,17]. Furthermore, inhibition of p38
MAPK activation has been demonstrated to provide
protection in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models of
brain injury [18-22]. Activation of JNK is induced in the
brain after focal ischemia [7-10]. Cumulative evidence
from experiments using JNK inhibitors or JNK knockout
mice reveals a pivotal role of JNK in neuronal apoptosis
and a benefit of the inhibitors in focal stroke models
[23-26]. Phosphorylation of ERK occurs at different time
intervals after I/R injury [8,9]. However, whether the
activation of ERK is associated with neuronal protection
or damage in ischemic brain remains to be determined

unequivocally [27,28]. Taken together, these results indicate that the activation of MAPK families is involved
in the process of ischemia-induced neuronal injury.
Thus, the studies of MAPK activation in ischemic brain
may provide fertile ground for the discovery of novel
therapeutic agents for stroke patients.
Bilobalide (Figure 1C) is a predominant sesquiterpene
trilactone constituent that accounts for 2.9% of the standardized Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761, which has been
widely used to treat a variety of neurological disorders
involving cerebral ischemia and neurodegeneration [29,30].
Substantial experimental evidence indicates that bilobalide
possesses many beneficial effects, such as neuroprotective,
anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anticonvulsant effects in various models [31-34]. Bilobalide has recently
attracted considerable interest, owing to its potent effects
on the central nervous system, such as acting as a noncompetitive inhibitor of γ-aminobutyric acid, glycine, and
5-HT3 receptors [35-38]. Bilobalide has been demonstrated
to reduce infarct areas and edema formation after focal
cerebral ischemia in rodents [31,39], antagonize neuronal
damage [40], and accelerate the regeneration of rat motor
neurons in cell culture [41]. Several recent reports have
shown that bilobalide can attenuate neuronal inflammation
and apoptosis in the frontal cortex and hippocampus CA1
in a rat model of Alzheimer’s disease [42], reduce ischemiainduced glutamate release in both core and penumbral
regions [43], significantly enhance hippocampal neuronal
proliferation and synaptogenesis, and protect against
amyloid-β oligomer-induced synaptic loss by modulating phosphorylation of the cyclic-AMP response element
binding protein [44]. In addition, bilobalide prevents apoptosis through activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in SHSY5Y cells [45]. Together, these studies clearly show that
the neuroprotective effects of bilobalide are closely related
to both anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic pathways,
although its specific mechanisms are not well understood.
In this study, we hypothesized that MAPK pathways
could be a therapeutic target of bilobalide in conditions of
cerebral I/R injury. We investigated, therefore, the effects
of bilobalide on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and the expression of p-ERK1/2, p-JNK1/2, and
p-p38 MAPK in the ischemic penumbra of the cerebral
cortex after middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury in rats as well as in rat cortical
neurons after oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R, Figure 1A,B).

Methods
Experimental animals and middle cerebral artery
occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) model

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 280 to 320 g,
were provided by the Laboratory Animal Center of
Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China) and
housed under diurnal lighting conditions (12-hour light/
dark cycle). All experimental protocols and animal handling procedures were performed in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health USA Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were approved by
the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Southern
Medical University.
Rats were allowed free access to food and water but
were fasted 12 h before surgery. All animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital
(45 mg/kg). The MCAO/R model was performed as
described previously, with minor modifications [46].
Briefly, the right common carotid artery, internal carotid
artery, and external carotid artery were exposed through a
ventral midline neck incision. The internal carotid artery
was then isolated and coagulated, and the proximal common carotid artery was ligated. A 4-0 monofilament nylon
suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co. Ltd., Beijing, China)
with a rounded tip was inserted into the internal carotid
artery from the common carotid artery through the external carotid artery stump and gently advanced 18 to
20 mm to occlude the middle cerebral artery. After 2 h of
MCAO, the suture was removed to restore blood flow
(reperfusion). The rats were placed into cages to recover
after incision closure, with free access to food and water.
Sham-operated rats underwent identical surgery except
that the suture was not inserted. Core body temperature
was maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5°C using a heating pad and
heating lamp during the whole procedure.
Rats were divided randomly into six groups: sham
group, MCAO/R group, and treatment groups, which
were pretreated with bilobalide (with purity ≥ 96.0%,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at doses of 2.5, 5, and
10 mg/kg and nimodipine (Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany)
at a dose of 4 mg/kg (positive control), respectively. Brain
levels of bilobalide increase for the dose range 1 to 10 mg/
kg, but they decrease for higher doses (20 and 40 mg/kg)
[47]. Referring to a previous study [48] and our pre-test,
we determined the doses (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) of bilobalide. Nimodipine is a cerebroselective calcium channel

blocker, which readily crosses the blood-brain barrier
and has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects in
cerebral I/R injury [49,50]. The neuroprotective mechanism
of nimodipine may be related to both anti-inflammatory
and anti-apoptotic pathways. Nimodipine may protect the
penumbral region from becoming necrotic. Therefore, we
used nimodipine as a positive control drug. It has been well
proved that nimodipine at 4 mg/kg is a high and effective
dose in cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury, and the
dose is very close to the effective dose of bilobalide [50,51].
Bilobalide (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, in saline containing 10%
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) and nimodipine (4 mg/kg)
were administered via a single intraperitoneal injection
60 min prior to surgery.
Evaluation of neurological deficit

Neurological deficit was evaluated 24 h after reperfusion
by an investigator who was unaware of animal grouping.
A five-point scale of neurologic deficit scores was used to
evaluate neurological behavior, referring to the methods of
Longa et al. and Bederson et al. [52,53] (Table 1).
Quantification of infarct volume, infarct weight, and brain
water content

After neurological evaluation, rats were decapitated and
the brains were rapidly removed and mildly frozen to keep
the morphology intact during slicing. Infarct volume was
measured as described previously [54]. In brief, brains
(n = 6 for each group) were cut into 2-mm-thick coronal
sections in a brain matrix and stained with 2% (w/v)
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at 37°C followed by
overnight immersion in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. The
infarct tissue area remained unstained (white), whereas
normal tissue was stained red. The infarct areas on each
slice were demarcated and analyzed by Image J software
(National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). To
compensate for the effect of brain edema, the corrected
infarct volume was calculated as follows [46]:
Percentage of corrected infarct volume ¼ f½Contralateral
hemisphere area − Ipsilateralhemisphere area − Measured

infarct area  = Contralateral hemisphere areag  100%

To evaluate the infarction areas further, the infarct
tissue areas were separated from normal tissue using a

as follows:

After brain extraction, animals observed to have experienced a subarachnoid hemorrhage were excluded from
the study.
Brain water content was determined by the wet-dry
method in another subgroup (n = 6 for each group) after
neurological assessment [39]. The ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were weighed with an electronic
scale (wet weight) and dried overnight at 105°C in a
desiccating oven. The dried brain hemispheres were
weighed again (dry weight), and the total brain water
content was calculated according to:
½ðWet weight − Dry weightÞ = Wet weight  100%
Ischemic penumbra dissection

After neurological assessment, rats were decapitated and
the brains were rapidly removed. The ischemic penumbra
of the cerebral cortex was determined according to the
methods as previously described [55]. Briefly, the brain
was sectioned into three slices, starting 3 mm from the
anterior tip of the frontal lobe in the coronal plane. The
slices were 3, 4, and 3 mm thick from front to back,
respectively. The middle slice was cut longitudinally in the
ischemic hemisphere 2 mm from the midline, and then a
transverse diagonal cut was made at the 2 o’clock position
to separate the core from the penumbra (Figure 1B).
Measurements of the levels of superoxide dismutase and
malondialdehyde

The ischemic penumbra was dissected out and homogenized with cold normal saline, centrifuged at 12,500 g for
10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected for
assays. The antioxidant status of the brain was assessed
by the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). The lipid
peroxidation was determined by the concentration of
malondialdehyde (MDA), an end product of lipid peroxidation, according to the kit instructions (Nanjing Jiancheng
Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). The activity of

SOD was evaluated by the xanthine oxidase method.
Briefly, 1 ml of Reagent 1 was added to measure and
control tubes, respectively. Then, 0.2 ml of samples
were added to measure tubes and 0.2 ml distilled water
was added to control tubes. Next, 0.1 ml of Reagent 2, 3, 4
were added to measure and control tubes, respectively.
The solution was mixed and incubated at 37°C for 40 min
in a water bath and 2 ml chromogenic agents were added
per tube. After mixing, the solution was placed at room
temperature for 10 min. The absorbance was determined
at 550 nm with a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The SOD activity was calculated
as follows:

The MDA content was assayed using a thiobarbituric
acid method. Briefly, the same volumes (0.2 ml) of anhydrous ethanol, standard solution, measure solution, and
measure solution were added to the blank, standard,
measure, and control tubes, respectively. Then 0.2 ml
Reagent 1 and 3 ml Reagent 2 were added per tube, 1 ml
Reagent 3 was added to the blank, standard, and measured
tubes, and 1 ml 50% glacial acetic acid was added to the
control tube. The solution was mixed and incubated at
95°C for 40 min in a water bath. After cooling, the solution
was centrifuged at 4,000 g for 10 min. The absorbance of
the supernatant was determined at 532 nm using a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).

Primary cortical neuron culture and oxygen-glucose
deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R)

Primary cultures of cortical neurons were obtained from
fetal rats at 17 days of gestation. The procedures have
been described previously [56]. Briefly, cerebral cortices
were isolated and digested in 0.25% trypsin. The resulting

Jiang et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2014, 11:167
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/11/1/167

cell suspension was plated onto poly-L-lysine pre-coated
wells and cultivated in DMEM with 10% FCS and 10%
fatal horse serum in a humidified atmosphere of 95%
air and 5% CO2 at 37°C. Cytosine-D-arabinofuranoside
(10 μM) was added to the cultures 36 h after plating, to
avoid proliferation of non-neuronal elements, and was
kept for 2 days before medium replacement. Only mature
(10 to 12 days in vitro) cultures were used for experiments. The purity of the neuronal cultures was confirmed
by microtubule associated proteins-2 (MAP-2) staining
[57]. Briefly, cultures (10 to 12 days) were fixed for 30 min
in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, and then washed three
times with PBS buffer. Cells were permeabilized with
0.01% Triton X-100. After washing, cultures were blocked
for 30 min with 3% horse serum, and then incubated for
2 h at room temperature with monoclonal mitogenactivated protein (MAP)-2 antibodies (1:500 dilution,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). After washing,
FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:100
dilution, Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL, USA) were
incubated for 45 min. Cells were observed in an inverted
fluorescence microscope. Digital images of marked fields
stained for MAP-2 were saved and analyzed. Over 95% of
the cells in the cultures were neurons, as determined by
immunostaining of the neuron-specific marker MAP-2.
Previous studies have indicated that bilobalide (25 to
100 μM) can dose-dependently protect neurons against
oxidative stress, and that incubation of cells with bilobalide alone at 100 μM does not affect cell viability [40].
In a pre-test, we found that pretreatment of primary
cultured neurons with bilobalide at 50 and 100 μM
significantly increased cell viability. Pretreatment with
bilobalide at 25 μM showed an increase in cell viability.
However, the change did not prove to be significant. A
higher concentration (>100 μM) may affect cell viability.
Therefore, we used bilobalide at concentrations of 50 and
100 μM in the final experiment.
Oxygen-glucose deprivation and reoxygenation was performed as reported previously with minor modifications
[58]. Cortical neurons were previously cultured in bilobalide (50, 100 μM) for 12 h by dissolving bilobalide in
serum-free DMEM (bilobalide was dissolved in DMSO
and added to the medium, and DMSO at the final concentrations used was less than 0.1%). The cultures were then
incubated with a glucose-free Earle’s balanced salt solution
(BSS) (containing a deoxygenated reagent, 0.5 mmol/l
sodium dithionite) and immediately transferred to a
humidified anaerobic chamber for 2 h (Reming Bioinstrument, Redfield, NY, USA) perfused with 95% N2 and
5% CO2 at 37°C. Reoxygenation was induced by quickly
replacing the deoxygenated and glucose-free BSS with
the pre-OGD culture medium and returning the cells
to normoxic conditions. Control sister culture plates
were exposed to oxygenated BSS containing 5.5 mM

Page 6 of 17

glucose in normoxic conditions during the same period
as the OGD cultures.
Assessment of cell viability

The cell viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. At
24 h after reoxygenation, MTT solution (5 mg/ml; 10 μl/
well) was added, and cells were incubated for an additional
4 h at 37°C. Subsequently, DMSO (200 μl/well) was added
to each well for 10 min, to dissolve the formazan crystals.
The absorbance was measured at 490 nm with an ELISA
plate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
Cell viability was expressed as the percentage of viable
cells in OGD/R with bilobalide pretreatment plates compared with control normoxic plates, as determined by
MTT reduction. Each experiment was repeated in triplicate using three independent cultures.
To increase the reliability of the MTT results obtained,
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release was determined using
an LDH assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering
Institute, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. At 24 h after reoxygenation, the culture
media were harvested and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100
for 30 min at 37°C to release the intracellular LDH. The
absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The
LDH release was expressed as a percentage of LDH values
of total neurons.
Measurements of nitric oxide, TNF-α, and IL-1β
concentrations

Nitric oxide, TNF-α, and IL-1β concentrations were measured in the ischemic penumbra of the cerebral cortex
and cortical neurons. Briefly, the penumbral sections were
collected and homogenized through sonication: the samples were quickly frozen and stored at −20°C until assayed
for TNF-α and IL-1β using a commercially available
ELISA kit (Toray Fujibionics, Tokyo, Japan). Similarly, the
secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β into the culture supernatant
was measured using the ELISA kits. The nitric oxide concentration was expressed as nitrites and nitrates (nitric
oxide metabolites), which were detected using a nitric
oxide nitrate reductase assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The nitric oxide concentration
was calculated as follows in tissue samples:

Effect of bilobalide on neurological deficit scores

Isolation of proteins and Western blot analysis

The proteins in the ischemic penumbra of cerebral cortex
and cortical neurons were isolated, as previously described
[59]. Briefly, the samples were homogenized in lysis
buffer and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The
supernatants were collected and employed for protein
determination using the Beyotime Protein Assay Kit
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Nanjing, China).
As previously described in detail, [59] protein samples
were denatured in reducing buffer and separated on
10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (20 to 50 μg/lane) and then transferred to a
polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, USA). The membrane was blocked with 5%
nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05%
Tween-20 (TBST) buffer and then incubated with primary
antibodies for p-ERK1/2 (p: phosphorylated, active form),
p-JNK1/2, p-p38 MAPK (1:500 dilution), total ERK1/2,
total JNK1/2, and total p38 MAPK (1:1000 dilution, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) overnight at
4°C. The following day, the membranes were washed three
times with TBST buffer and incubated with secondary
antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000
dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at room
temperature. To prove equal loading, the blots were analyzed for β-actin (housekeeping gene) expression using
an anti-β-actin antibody (1:500 dilution, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). After washing, the membranes were analyzed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, USA). Protein signals were quantified by scanning
densitometry using Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The levels of total
ERK1/2, total JNK1/2, and total p38 MAPK were expressed
as relative integrated intensity normalized versus β-actin.
The p-ERK1/2, p-JNK1/2, and p-p38 MAPK signals were
shown as the ratio of the integrated intensity of the phosphorylated versus the unphosphorylated form.
Statistical analysis

Values are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean.
All data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), followed by the least significant difference post
hoc test (two-tailed). All statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS software (version 13.0). P < 0.05 was considered
to be statistically significant. Neurological deficit scores
were expressed as median (range). The neurological deficit
scores among different groups were compared using the

After 2 h of ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion, rats
subjected to MCAO showed significant motor behavioral
deficits. Neurological deficit scores were significantly
increased in the MCAO/R group (P < 0.01, Figure 2B).
Administration of bilobalide (5, 10 mg/kg) and nimodipine resulted in a significant decrease in neurological
scores in comparison with the MCAO/R group (P < 0.01,
Figure 2B). There were no statistical differences in the
scores between the bilobalide (2.5 mg/kg) and MCAO/R
groups (P > 0.05, Figure 2B).
Effects of bilobalide on infarct volume, infarct weight,
and brain water content

Extensive infarction was detected by TTC staining in the
cerebral cortical and subcortical areas over a series of
sections of the ipsilateral hemisphere in rats subjected to
MCAO (Figure 2A). Rats pretreated with both bilobalide
(5, 10 mg/kg) and nimodipine had significantly smaller
corrected infarct volumes than those in the MCAO/R
group (P < 0.01, Figure 2A,C). Moreover, there was a
significant increase in infarct weight after 24 h of reperfusion, whereas bilobalide (5, 10 mg/kg) and nimodipine
pretreatment remarkably reduced infarct weight in brain
sections (P < 0.01, Figure 2C).
Brain water content was examined to assess brain edema
in both ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of all the
groups. Brain water content was remarkably increased in
the ipsilateral hemisphere in the MCAO/R group, which
was significantly reduced by bilobalide (5, 10 mg/kg)
pretreatment (P < 0.05, Figure 3). In contrast, MCAO
induced a much slighter increase in brain water content
in the contralateral hemisphere (Figure 3). In addition,
pretreatment with bilobalide and nimodipine did not
affect brain water content in the contralateral hemisphere
in comparison with the MCAO/R group (P > 0.05, Figure 3).
Bilobalide pretreatment at a lower dose (2.5 mg/kg) failed
to limit cerebral infarct volume, infarct weight, and brain
edema (P > 0.05, Figures 2A,C, 3). No infarction and edema
formation were observed in the sham operation group
(Figures 2A,C, 3).
Effects of bilobalide on the levels of SOD and MDA

The activity of SOD was significantly lower and the
concentration of MDA was higher in the ischemic penumbra of the cerebral cortex in the MCAO/R group than
in the sham operation group (P < 0.01, Figure 4). Both
bilobalide (5, 10 mg/kg) and nimodipine pretreatment
significantly increased SOD activity and decreased MDA

levels of SOD and MDA significantly (Figure 4).
Effects of bilobalide on the levels of nitric oxide, TNF-α,
and IL-1β in ischemic penumbra after MCAO/R

To explore whether bilobalide pretreatment could induce
an anti-inflammatory pattern, we investigated the expression of three pro-inflammatory mediators in the ischemic
penumbra of the cerebral cortex after 24 h of reperfusion
by ELISA and specific assay kit. The MCAO/R group had
significantly higher expression of nitric oxide, TNF-α,
and IL-1β than did the sham group (P < 0.01, Figure 5).
In comparison with the MCAO/R group, bilobalide (5,
10 mg/kg) and nimodipine pretreatment significantly
reduced concentrations of nitric oxide, TNF-α, and IL-

1β in the ischemic penumbra (P < 0.05, Figure 5). There
were no significant differences between the bilobalide
(2.5 mg/kg) and MCAO/R groups (P > 0.05, Figure 5).
Effects of bilobalide on the expression of ERK1/2, JNK1/2,

Western blot analysis at 24 h following reperfusion
showed, in the ischemic penumbra in MCAO/R rats, a
significantly increased expression of the active p-ERK1/
2, p-JNK1/2, and p-p38 MAPK in comparison with that
of sham-operated animals (P < 0.05, Figure 6). In rats
pretreated with bilobalide (5, 10 mg/kg) and nimodipine
prior to MCAO there was a remarkable decrease in the
levels of p-JNK1/2 and p-p38 MAPK, whereas p-ERK1/2
was unaffected, as compared with MCAO/R animals

Effect of bilobalide on cell viability in primary cortical
neurons after OGD/R

Neuronal viability was assessed by both the MTT assay
and measurement of extracellular LDH activity. After
primary cortical neurons were exposed to 2 h of OGD
following 24 h of reoxygenation, cell viability was significantly decreased and the level of LDH release was
remarkably increased (P < 0.01, Figure 7). By contrast,
incubation of cells with different concentrations of bilobalide (50, 100 μM) alone for 12 h did not affect cell
viability (Figure 7A). Furthermore, pretreatment of cortical
neurons with bilobalide (50, 100 μM) for 12 h, significantly
increased the cell viability and decreased the LDH concentration (P < 0.05, Figure 7).
Effects of bilobalide on the levels of nitric oxide, TNF-α,
and IL-1β in primary cortical neurons after OGD/R

To examine further whether bilobalide pretreatment could
associate with inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediator
production, we measured the concentrations of nitric
oxide, TNF-α, and IL-1β in OGD/R-induced cortical neurons. A similar pattern was observed in primary cortical

expression of nitric oxide, TNF-α, and IL-1β significantly
increased in OGD/R group (P < 0.01, Figure 8). As
expected, pretreatment with bilobalide (50, 100 μM) led to
a suppression on nitric oxide, TNF-α, and IL-1β expression
in OGD/R-induced cortical neurons (P < 0.05, Figure 8).

in OGD/R-induced cortical neurons by Western blotting.
Consistent with results in vivo, in primary cortical neurons
exposed to 2 h of OGD followed by 24 h of reoxygenation, there was a significant up-regulation of p-ERK1/2,
p-JNK1/2, and p-p38 MAPK in comparison with control
neurons (P < 0.01, Figure 9). As expected, in OGD/Rinduced cortical neurons bilobalide (50, 100 μM) pretreatment significantly down-regulated p-JNK1/2 and
p-p38 MAPK, but did not have an effect on p-ERK1/2
expression (Figure 9). No significant differences were
observed in the expression of total ERK1/2, total JNK1/

2, and total p38 MAPK among all experimental groups
in vitro (P > 0.05, Figure 9).

Discussion
Since focal ischemia in the territory of the middle cerebral artery is the dominating cause of clinical stroke, the
experimental model of MCAO is widely used in the
study of ischemic stroke [60]. Focal cerebral ischemia is
induced by temporary occlusion of the proximal portion
of the right middle cerebral artery using the intraluminal
suture method in rats. Reperfusion remains the treatment of choice for limiting brain injury following stroke,

while restoration of blood flow is frequently associated
with an exacerbation of tissue injury and a profound
inflammatory response called reperfusion injury. Focal
cerebral ischemia, particularly reperfusion injury, triggers
multiple and distinct but overlapping cell signaling
pathways in the brain, which may lead to cell survival
or damage [61,62]. However, the mechanisms involving
neuronal fate following I/R insult are complex and not
fully understood. There is increasing evidence to show
that MAPK signaling pathways become activated and play
vital roles after focal cerebral I/R injury [7-10,13,14].
Bilobalide, a predominant sesquiterpene trilactone constituent of Ginkgo biloba leaves, has already been shown
to exert potent neuroprotective and anti-apoptotic properties [31,32,45]. Since the first beneficial effect of bilobalide
was detected on cytotoxic brain edema caused by triethyltin [63], several reports have not only revealed its diverse
pharmacological properties but have also raised some
speculative proposals concerning its mechanism of action
[31-38]. Bilobalide has been demonstrated to have a protective effect on infarct volume in the rat model of focal

cerebral ischemia, but to have no effect on the rats following global ischemia [48]. Bilobalide has been proposed to
exert protective and trophic effects on neurons, and act
on astrocytes that contribute strongly to brain swelling
[31,39]. In addition, attenuation of neuronal damage and
apoptosis by bilobalide was closely related to suppression
of the up-regulation of c-myc, p53, bax, TNF-α, Aβ1–40
expression, and activation of caspase-3 [31,42]. Recent
evidence has further shown that the protective effects of
bilobalide against neuronal apoptosis were associated with
increasing PI3K activity and up-regulation of phosphorylated Akt in a dose-dependent manner, and could be
abrogated by the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 [45].
Taken together, these studies clearly show that bilobalide
protects against cerebral I/R injury and suggest that
modulation of both anti-apoptotic signaling cascades
and pro-inflammatory mediators might underlie this
protection.
In this study, we used MCAO/R and OGD/R models
of cerebral I/R injury to further investigate the neuroprotective effects of bilobalide as well as the underlying

mechanisms, by focusing on MAPK signaling pathways,
as these pathways were closely related to inflammatory
response and apoptotic signaling. In line with previous
studies, our results indicated that bilobalide had significant neuroprotective effects against cerebral I/R injury.
The evidence was that bilobalide improved neurological
function, decreased infarct volume, and ameliorated brain
edema when administered intraperitoneally at doses of 5
and 10 mg/kg 60 min prior to MCAO. Previous studies
have shown that when administered either 60 min before
MCAO or immediately after ischemia, bilobalide reduced
infarct volume significantly, whereas no effect was demonstrated when bilobalide was administered 60 min after
ischemia [48]. Our results indicated clearly that bilobalide,
when administered 60 min before MCAO, significantly
reduced infarct volume and infarct weight. A strong

beneficial effect of bilobalide on anti-edema formation
has been detected in models of brain ischemia in vivo
and in vitro [39]. Thus, bilobalide may be developed as
a potential anti-edema drug. As reported by previous
studies, brain edema reached its peak 24 h following
ischemia in experimental models [64,65]. Here we showed
that bilobalide pretreatment decreased brain water
content significantly, whereas nimodipine did not. Interestingly, our data demonstrated that the brain water
content was significantly increased in both the ipsilateral
and contralateral hemispheres in the MCAO/R group,
although infarct areas by TTC staining were just detected
in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Furthermore, bilobalide had
an anti-edemic effect in the ipsilateral hemisphere but
did not have any effect on the contralateral hemisphere.
Bilobalide’s anti-edema effect was involved in improving
the maintenance of ionic balances, and astrocytes might be
the target [66,67]. Since an outstanding anti-inflammatory
effect of bilobalide has been reported recently [33], we
assume that the anti-edema mechanisms of bilobalide
might also relate to its anti-inflammatory activity.
It has been well proven that cerebral ischemia significantly increases the content of reactive oxygen species,
such as hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, and hydrogen
peroxide, and decreases the activity of antioxidant enzymes
in the cerebral cortex [68,69]. In this study, we showed that
bilobalide pretreatment significantly increased SOD activity
and decreased MDA levels in the ischemic penumbra
of the cerebral cortex. Thus, our results have provided
evidence for bilodalide’s antioxidative activity after focal
cerebral I/R.
Focal cerebral I/R injury causes a robust increase in
typical markers of inflammation, such as nitric oxide,
TNF-α, and IL-1β, which are involved in the process of
cell damage. Recent studies reported that many types of
actions induced by TNF-α and IL-1β were mediated by
caspase pathways and inducible nitric oxide synthasederived nitric oxide [70]. It has been suggested that
nitric oxide is detrimental in ischemic brain injury whereas
evidence also supports that nitric oxide produced by
inducible nitric oxide synthase may act as a neurotrophic
agent by promoting the differentiation and survival of
neurons [71]. Taken together, nitric oxide, TNF-α, and
IL-1β have important roles in the pathogenesis of cerebral
I/R injury. Here, we showed that the expression of nitric
oxide, TNF-α, and IL-1β in MCAO/R rats were significantly higher than those in sham animals. According
to more recent findings, bilobalide has an excellent
anti-inflammatory effect [33] and could inhibit TNF-α
expression in the frontal cortex and hippocampus CA1
of Alzheimer’s disease model rats [42]. Similarly, we
showed that pretreatment with bilobalide significantly
reduced the expression of nitric oxide, TNF-α, and IL1β in the ischemic penumbra.

Neuronal damage after I/R injury occurs via oxidative
stress, inflammation response, or mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately activates an apoptotic cascade. These
events demonstrate overlapping and redundant features
and depend on the intensity and duration of ischemic
insult. The importance of MAPK signaling pathways as
both targets and mediators of cerebral I/R injury is
becoming increasingly recognized. Oxidative stress and
inflammatory mediators produced after the onset of
cerebral I/R have been shown to activate MAPK signaling
cascades that participate in neuronal survival or damage
[8,10,13]. Our results demonstrated that phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK protein were

significantly increased in the ischemic penumbra in
MCAO/R rats. Bilobalide inhibited JNK1/2 and p38
MAPK activation, but had no effect on the increased
p-ERK1/2 expression. Furthermore, we examined the
neuroprotective effects of bilobalide on OGD/R-induced
cortical neurons. The results showed that pretreatment of
cortical neurons with bilobalide significantly increased
the cell viability and decreased the LDH concentration.
Consistent with results in vivo, there was also a significant up-regulation of p-ERK1/2, p-JNK1/2, and p-p38
MAPK in primary cortical neurons exposed to 2 h of

Figure 9 Effects of bilobalide on the expression of ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK in primary cortical neurons after OGD/R. (A)
Pretreatment with bilobalide (50, 100 μM) did not have an effect on p-ERK1/2 level (B) and significantly reduced p-JNK1/2 level (C) and remarkably
down-regulated p-p38 MAPK expression in OGD/R-induced cortical neurons compared with the OGD/R group. No significant differences were
observed in the expression of total ERK1/2, total JNK1/2, and total p38 MAPK among all experimental groups in vitro. Mean values ± standard error of

significantly down-regulated in bilobalide-treated cells,
and no change in the expression of p-ERK1/2 was
observed. These results suggested that JNK1/2 and p38
MAPK pathways could be involved in the neuroprotective
effects of bilobalide. It is known that, the activated JNK
and p38 MAPK mainly function as mediators of cellular
stress in cerebral I/R injury by phosphorylating intracellular enzymes, transcription factors, and cytosolic proteins
involved in cell survival, inflammatory mediators production, and apoptosis [8]. Phosphorylated ERK, JNK, and
p38 MAPK activated their phosphorylated substrates such
as CREB, c-Myc, Elk-1, ATF-2, and c-Jun, and increased
expression of p-CREB, p-Elk-1, p-c-Myc, p-ATF-2, and pc-Jun occurred in the infarct penumbra at 4 h following
reperfusion [9]. Active JNK has been shown to stabilize
wild-type p53 by phosphorylation similar to c-Jun and
JNK-mediated phosphorylation increases p53-dependent
trans-activation and potentiates p53-mediated cell death.
In cerebral ischemia, increased neuronal expression of
p53 and activation of bax, a pro-apoptotic p53 target gene,
have been reported [72]. Moreover, the PI3K-Akt pathway
prevented neuronal apoptosis by suppressing the activation of JNK and c-Jun expression [13]. Interestingly, a

recent study showed that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by bilobalide blocked cell apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells
[45]. These studies indicated that the protective effects
of bilobalide against neuronal apoptosis could associate
with suppressing the activation of JNK1/2. Phosphorylated p38 MAPK can phosphorylate MAP kinase AP-2
and MAP kinase AP-3, which regulate Hsp-27, increase
the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
TNF-α and IL-6, induce an inflammatory cascade, and
increase cellular damage [73,74]. Suppression of p38
MAPK phosphorylation probably reduces neuronal cell
death by inhibiting the production of inflammatory
mediators [18]. In many cell death models, p38 MAPK
acts upstream of caspase execution. Therefore, regulation
of neuronal damage by JNK and p38 MAPK pathways is
related to multiple downstream transcription factors and
apoptosis-associated proteins. More interestingly, previous
studies showed that bilobalide shared common downstream targets with the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways
such as CREB, c-myc, p53, bax, caspase-3, TNF-α, and
even the PI3K-Akt pathway [31,42,45]. These findings,
together with our results, support the involvement of the
JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways in the neuroprotective

Jiang et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation 2014, 11:167
http://www.jneuroinflammation.com/content/11/1/167

effects of bilobalide. Notably, bilobalide failed to inhibit
the increased p-ERK1/2 expression; this was consistent
with previous observations that bilobalide treatment did
not change p-ERK1/2 levels in SH-SY5Y cells [45].
Our data indicated that there was also a significant
up-regulation of nitric oxide, TNF-α, IL-1β, p-ERK1/2,
p-JNK1/2, and p-p38 MAPK in primary cortical neurons
exposed to 2 h of OGD followed by 24 h of reoxygenation. This is consistent with previous reports regarding
the production of pro-inflammatory mediators [75-77]
and the activation of MAPK pathways [8,78] in cultured
cortical neurons after OGD/R. However, pretreatment
with bilobalide significantly down-regulated nitric oxide,
TNF-α, IL-1β, p-JNK1/2, and p-p38 MAPK concentration
in primary cortical neurons after OGD/R. Bilobalide may
also affect inflammatory and apoptotic processes in nonneuronal cell types (for example, microglia, astrocytes,
endothelial cells) which were spared in ischemic brain.
Further work is necessary to clarify this point. Nevertheless, the results generated by using an in vitro OGD/R
model convincingly demonstrate a prominent role for
bilobalide in cerebral I/R injury.
Previous evidence has suggested that bilobalide crosses
the blood-brain barrier easily and rapidly (and bilobalide
can remain in brain tissue in a prolonged manner after
ischemia has been induced), and reaches extracellular
concentrations in brain that allow efficient interaction
with target molecules, such as neurotransmitter receptors
[79]. Moreover, bilobalide, when given before MCAO,
remains in the brain tissue for extended periods of time
even after disruption of blood flow [79]. Therefore, the
availability of bilobalide in brain is evidently sufficient
to explain the neuroprotective effects of bilobalide. The
clinical studies, in addition, showed that bilobalide was
highly bioavailable, with bioavailability of 70%, and well
tolerated [47,80]. In particular, bilobalide can be given
in a preventive manner with little potential for adverse
side effects.

Conclusions
In summary, this study demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of bilobalide on cerebral I/R injury were
associated with attenuation of nitric oxide, TNF-α, and
IL-1β production and suppression of JNK1/2 and p38
MAPK activation. Although further studies are needed
to elucidate the roles of MAPK signaling pathways in the
cross talk between pro-inflammatory mediators and apoptosis, our findings may represent a novel mechanism of
bilobalide in focal cerebral I/R injury in rats (Figure 1B).
Since bilobalide has originally been identified as a potential
neuroprotective drug, our results may provide new insight
into therapeutic targets of bilobalide in patients with
neurodegenerative disorders, such as stroke, Alzheimer’s
disease, and dementia by unknown causes.
