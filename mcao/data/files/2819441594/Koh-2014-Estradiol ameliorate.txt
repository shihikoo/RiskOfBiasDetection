Estradiol plays a neuroprotective role against focal cerebral ischemia. Parvalbumin is an intracellular Ca2+ binding protein. It exerts a neuroprotective effect against cytotoxic Ca2+ overload. This study investigated
whether estradiol modulates parvalbumin expression in focal cerebral ischemia and glutamate-induced
neuronal cell death. Adult female rats were ovariectomied and treated with vehicle or estradiol prior to
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The cerebral cortex was collected 24 h after MCAO. A proteomics
approach showed a decrease of parvalbumin in MCAO-operated animals, while estradiol prevented the
MCAO-induced decrease in parvalbumin. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses conﬁrmed that estradiol treatment attenuated the MCAO-induced decrease in parvalbumin levels. The results
of immunohistochemical staining showed that the number of parvalbumin-positive cells decreased in
MCAO-operated animals, and estradiol prevented the MCAO-induced decrease in parvalbumin-positive
cells. In cultured hippocampal cells, glutamate exposure raised the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, while
estradiol treatment attenuated this increase. Moreover, estradiol prevented the decrease in parvalbumin
induced by glutamate toxicity. These ﬁndings suggest that estradiol exerts a neuroprotective effect by
preventing the MCAO-induced decrease of parvalbumin and by regulating intracellular Ca2+ levels.

Estradiol is a female sex hormone produced in the ovaries and
brain. In addition to its roles in reproduction and metabolic
function, estradiol also exerts a potent neuroprotective effect in
the central nervous system [3]. Estradiol inhibits neuronal cells
death that occurs in response to oxidative stress and excitotoxic
amino acids [8,10]. In ovariectomized female animal, estradiol
treatment signiﬁcantly reduces the infarct volume and improves
neuronal dysfunction after focal ischemia [22,25]. Because of neuroprotection by estradiol, premenopausal women are relatively
protected from neurodegenerative diseases when compared to
adult men [3,19]. However, postmenopausal women have more

serious morbidity and mortality in neurodegenerative diseases
than do age-matched men [19].
Ischemic brain injury leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and
energy exhaustion [4]. The disrupted membrane potential causes
an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration and neuronal cell
damage [12]. Intracellular calcium signaling is essential in wide
range of neurological conditions such as neuronal transmission,
cell growth, and synaptic plasticity [2]. Parvalbumin is a Ca2+ binding albumin protein containing EF-hand type calcium binding
sites. It is structurally related to calmodulin and troponin C.
Parvalbumin is present in the nervous system, especially the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex [5,6]. Parvalbumin sequesters
intracellular Ca2+ and acts as a Ca2+ buffer in neuron [6]. Parvalbumin protects neuronal cells from Ca2+ overload through
its calcium buffering capacity [9,26]. Moreover, estradiol maintains Ca2+ homeostasis, preserves mitochondrial structure, and

P.-O. Koh / Neuroscience Letters 574 (2014) 36–40

protects neurons against free radicals [24,27]. Estradiol reduces
glutamate-induced intracellular Ca2+ overload in primary rat
hippocampal neuron cultures [11]. Intracellular calcium regulation is important for maintaining neuronal function. Although
previous studies demonstrated the neuroprotective effect of estradiol, more study is needed to elucidate its neuroprotective
mechanism. A proteomics approach elucidated the changes of
parvalbumin expression in ischemic brain injury. This study also
investigated whether estradiol modulate the expression of parvalbumin and regulate intracellular calcium levels during focal
cerebral ischemia and glutamate toxicity-induced neuronal cells
death.
Female Sprague–Dawley rats (225–250 g, n = 64) were used and
maintained under controlled temperature and lighting (12 h/12 h
light/dark cycle). They were randomly divided into four groups:
vehicle + sham, estradiol + sham, vehicle + middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO), and estradiol + MCAO groups (n = 16 per group).
Four animals per group were used for RT-PCR and Western blot
analyses, respectively. Also, four animals per group were used
for proteomic analysis and immunohistochemical staining, respectively.
The ovaries were removed bilaterally, and a silastic capsule
containing 17␤-estradiol (180 ␮g/mL, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)
or Sesame oil (Sigma, vehicle) was subcutaneously implanted.
This dose of estradiol administration produces circulating physiological estradiol concentration [8]. Two weeks after ovariectomy
and treatment, animals were performed MCAO to induce cerebral
ischemia [16]. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital
(100 mg/kg) before MCAO. In brief, the right common carotid artery,
internal carotid artery, and external carotid artery were exposed.
A 4/0 monoﬁlament nylon with heated rounded tip was inserted
from the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery and
advanced until the rounded tip occluded the origin of the middle
cerebral artery. The sham-operated animals were subjected to the
same procedures except for the insertion of ﬁlament. Twenty-four
hours after the onset of permanent occlusion, the animals were
decapitated and the brain was isolated. The brain tissues (Bregma
level 1 to −4 mm) were cut into coronal slices using brain matrix
(ASI instruments Inc., Warren, MI, USA).
For proteomic analysis, the right cerebral cortex was homogenized in lysis buffer (8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, ampholytes, 40 mM
Tris–HCl), and the suspensions were centrifuged at 15,000 × g.
The total protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein samples were
loaded on the immobilized pH gradients (IPG, range pH 4–7,
17 cm, Bio-Rad) strips. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was carried out
with Protean IEF Cell (Bio-Rad) with the following protocol: 250 V
(15 min), 10,000 V (3 h), and 10,000–50,000 V (7 h). After the ﬁrst
dimension separation, the strips were incubated in equilibration
buffer [6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS),
50 mM Tris–HCl, bromophenol blue] and loaded onto gradient gels
(7.5–17.5%). Second-dimension electrophoresis was performed on
Protein-II XI electrophoresis equipment (Bio-Rad) at 5 mA for 2 h
and followed by 10 mA at 10 ◦ C until the bromophenol blue dye
migrated off the bottom of the gel. The gels were ﬁxed with solution (12% acetic acid, 50% methanol) for 2 h and stained with silver
solution (0.2% silver nitrate, 0.75 mL/L formaldehyde) for 20 min.
The images were collected with an Agfar ARCUS 1200TM (AgfarGevaert, Mortsel, BEL). The images were analyzed using PDQuest
software (Bio-Rad). Protein spots were excised and destained. The
gel particles were digested in trypsin-containing buffer and the
extracted peptides were analyzed by a Voyager-DETM STR biospectrometry workstation (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)
for peptide mass ﬁngerprinting. Database searches were carried
out using the MS-Fit and ProFound program. SWISS-PROT and
NCBI were used as the protein sequence databases. The intensity

37

of protein spots was measured using PDQuest software. The spot
intensity is reported as a ratio relative to the vehicle + sham
group.
Total RNA of right cerebral cortex was isolated according to the manufacturer’s instructions using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with total RNA (1 ␮g) and Superscript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
protocol. The following primers were used: parvalbumin (forward primer, 5 -AAGAGTGCGGATGATGTGAAG-3 ; reverse primer,
5 -AGCCATCAGCGTCTTTGTTT-3 ) and actin (forward primer, 5 GGGTCAGAAGGACTCCTACG-3 ; reverse primer, 5 -TTTCACTGCGGCTGATGTAG-3 ). The ampliﬁcation program consists of a denaturing step at 94 ◦ C for 30 s, an annealing step at 54 ◦ C for 30 s
and an extension step at 72 ◦ C for 1 min for 35 cycles. PCR product was separated on a 1% agarose gel and visualized under UV
light.
For Western blot analysis, proteins (30 ␮g) were separated on
10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to poly-vinylidene
ﬂuoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1%
Tween-20 (TBST) and were incubated with 5% skim milk solution for 1 h to minimize the nonspeciﬁc antibody binding.
The membrane was incubated with the following antibodies:
anti-parvalbumin (diluted 1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and
anti-actin (diluted 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA). The membranes were washed in TBST and were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase conjugated-rabbit IgG as secondary
antibody (1:5000, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Targeted antigens were
visualized using an ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The brain tissues were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and embedded with parafﬁn,
and sectioned into 4 ␮m thick slices. The sections were blocked
with 1% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h and then incubated
with anti-parvalbumin antibody (diluted 1:200, Abcam) at 4 ◦ C
for 15 h. After rinsing with PBS, the sections were incubated
with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for 1 h, followed by avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex for 1 h from a Vector
ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA). The
sections were reacted with DAB solution with 0.03% hydrogen peroxidase for 3 min. The sections were counterstained with cresyl
violet, dehydrated in graded alcohol, and cleared. The slides were
observed under a microscope. The index of parvalbumin positive
cells was calculated by the ratio of the positive cells to total neuron.
Mouse hippocampal cells (HT22) were grown in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM, without l-glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 ␮g/mL),
and penicillin (100 unit/mL) (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA)
[17]. The cells were incubated in a humidiﬁed chamber at
37 ◦ C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. HT22 cells were seeded on
60 mm culture dishes at 100,000 cells per dish. Cells were
incubated with glutamate (Sigma) at a ﬁnal concentration of
5 mM in culture medium for 24 h. 17␤-Estradiol was treated
at 15 min before glutamate addition. 17␤-Estradiol was dissolved in 95% ethanol at a concentration of 1 mM and diluted
to the ﬁnal concentration of 1 ␮M or 10 ␮M in culture medium.
This concentration of ethanol had no effect on cell viability or
glutamate toxicity. Cell viability in the presence of glutamate
and 17␤-estradiol was determined by measuring metabolism
of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide
(MTT).
The intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured with a calcium indicator, Fura-2/AM [18]. After cells were treated with

38

17␤-estradiol or glutamate, they were incubated for 24 h and
kept in DMEM containing 10 ␮M fura-2/AM at 37 ◦ C for 1 h. Fura2/AM ﬂuorescence signals were measured with a luminescence
spectrophotometer (LS50B, Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA). Fluorescence signals were analyzed by a MicroVax II computer and
software (Origin 7). The intracellular Ca2+ concentration was determined using as a ratio as previously described [18].
Data are expressed as means ± S.E.M. The intensity analysis was
carried out by SigmaGel 1.0 (Jandel Scientiﬁc, San Rafael, CA, USA)
and SigmaPlot 4.0 (SPSS Inc., Point Richmond, CA, USA). The results
in each group were compared by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Student’s t-test. The difference for comparison was considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05.
A proteomics approach demonstrated that parvalbumin expression in the cerebral cortices of vehicle + MCAO animals was lower
than that in sham-operated animals. The reduction in parvalbumin was prevented in estradiol + MCAO animals (Fig. 1A and B).
Parvalbumin was expressed at similar levels in vehicle + sham
and estradiol + sham animals. The peptide mass of parvalbumin
protein was 5/103 and the sequence coverage was 40%. Parvalbumin levels were 0.67 ± 0.02 and 0.84 ± 0.04 in the cerebral
cortices of vehicle + MCAO and estradiol + MCAO animals, respectively. By reverse transcription-PCR, parvalbumin transcripts levels
were 0.41 ± 0.03 and 0.99 ± 0.02 in vehicle- and estradiol-treated
animals during MCAO, respectively (Fig. 1C and D). Western
blot analysis also clearly showed that parvalbumin levels were

decreased in vehicle-treated animals compared to sham-operated
animals during MCAO, whereas estradiol prevented the decrease
in parvalbumin expression. In the MCAO-operated animals, parvalbumin proteins levels were 0.62 ± 0.02 and 0.82 ± 0.02 in the
cerebral cortices of vehicle- and estradiol-treated animals, respectively (Fig. 2A and B). Immunohistochemical staining showed that
the number of parvalbumin-positive cells was lower in the cerebral
cortices of vehicle + MCAO animals than in sham-operated animals. However, estradiol treatment during MCAO attenuated the
injury-induced decrease in the number of parvalbumin-positive
cells (Fig. 2C–F). The index of parvalbumin positive cells was
10.25 ± 0.25% and 23.15 ± 0.45% in the vehicle + MCAO and estradiol + MCAO animals, respectively.
Fig. 3 showed that estradiol treatment prevented cell death due
to glutamate toxicity in cultured HT22 cells (Fig. 3A). Intracellular
Ca2+ levels were signiﬁcantly increased in only glutamate-treated
group, whereas estradiol treatment prevented the glutamateinduced increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 3B). Glutamate
treatment decreased parvalbumin expression, whereas estradiol
treatment attenuated this decrease (Fig. 3C). Parvalbumin levels
were 0.18 ± 0.02 in the glutamate-treated group and 0.51 ± 0.02
and 0.62 ± 0.04 in the 1 ␮M and 10 ␮M estradiol-treated groups,
respectively.
I previously conﬁrmed that estradiol exerts neuroprotective
effect against glutamate toxicity-induced cell death and MCAOinduced injury [13,14]. Estradiol signiﬁcantly reduces infarct

volume and decreases apoptosis in ischemic brain injury [8,13].
Moreover, estradiol protects neuronal cells against focal cerebral
ischemia by modulating various survival pathways [13,14]. This
study continuously showed that estradiol regulates parvalbumin
expression and modulates intracellular Ca2+ levels in ischemic
brain injury.
Ischemic injury signiﬁcantly elevates intracellular Ca2+ concentrations and leads to neuronal cell death [15,23]. However,
parvalbumin protects neurons from cytotoxic Ca2+ overload in neuronal cell injury [9], and the over-expression of parvalbumin in
transgenic mice rescues neurons from injury-induced cell death
[7]. Moreover, parvalbumin immunoreactive neurons are relatively resistant to ischemic damage [20]. Brain ischemia decreases
parvalbumin immunoreactivity, and reduced parvalbumin expression results in structural damage to neuronal cells [1,26]. This
study showed that estradiol prevented the MCAO-induced decrease
in parvalbumin expression through a proteomics approach. Furthermore, reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis
conﬁrmed this change in parvalbumin in MCAO animals with
estradiol. MCAO injury decreased parvalbumin levels, whereas
estradiol recovered these levels. Immunohistochemical staining
also showed that the number of cells expressing parvalbumin
decreases in MCAO animals, estradiol treatment attenuates these
decreases. The decrease of the number of parvalbumin positive
cells ultimately indicates the reduction of parvalbumin expression.
These results demonstrate that estradiol modulates parvalbumin
expression in cerebral ischemic injury. The decrease of parvalbumin induces arise in intracellular calcium, consequently leading to
neuronal cell death. Thus, the maintenance of parvalbumin is critical for attenuating neuronal cell death following ischemic brain
injury.
Glutamate toxicity causes serious oxidative stress and leads
to neuronal cell death [17]. This study conﬁrmed the protective effect of estradiol against glutamate toxicity in neuronal
cells. This study found that estradiol treatment attenuated the
glutamate-induced decrease in parvalbumin expression. Increased
intracellular calcium levels lead to cell degradation and death. This
study demonstrated that glutamate treatment increased intracellular calcium levels in HT22 cells, whereas estradiol attenuated
the glutamate-induced increase in intracellular calcium. Estradiol reduces the increase in glutamate-induced intracellular Ca2+
via the estrogen receptor of neurons [11]. Estradiol affects mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and
modulates cell activity in the rat brain [21]. Although further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism between parvalbumin
and estradiol in ischemic brain injury, these results demonstrate
that estradiol maintains parvalbumin levels despite ischemic brain
injury and attenuates injury-induced increases in intracellular calcium levels, thereby prevents neuronal death due to ischemia. In
conclusion, parvalbumin regulation by estradiol attenuates neuronal cell death by buffering Ca2+ concentrations in ischemic brain
injury.
