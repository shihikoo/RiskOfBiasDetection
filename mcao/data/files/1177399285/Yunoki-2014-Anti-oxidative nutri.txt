aggravate ischemic brain damage during such an acute stage
(Abe et al., 1995; Hayashi et al., 1999). After reperfusion of
acute ischemic stroke, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are
excessively generated, which promote apoptotic cell death
through protein, lipid, and DNA peroxidation (Schaller and

Graf, 2004; Zhang et al., 2004). Inﬂammation also plays an
important role in acute ischemic stroke through activating
macrophage and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (Dirnagl
et al., 1999). Thus, anti-oxidative and anti-inﬂammatory
actions could be an indispensable strategy for ameliorating
ischemic brain damage (Sun et al., 2002; Villegas et al., 2004).
We have previously reported that a free radical scavenger,
edaravone, strongly reduced brain edema after cerebral
ischemia in rats (Abe et al., 1988), which is not only in clinical
use for stroke patients in Japan, but also currently showing
good clinical effects in Europe (Kaste et al., 2013). Meanwhile,
polyphenols are contained in many foods such as green tea
(catechins), grape seed (proanthocyanidins), and red wine
(resveratrol), which also show both anti-oxidative and antiinﬂammatory effects (Landete, 2012). Polyphenols have been
shown partly to prevent coronary heart disease, dementia,
cancer, and arteriosclerosis (Ghosh and Scheepens, 2009). In
the present study, therefore, we investigated whether an
anti-oxidative nutrient rich enteral diet (AO diet) therapy
could reduce ischemic rat brain damage through antioxidative and anti-inﬂammatory mechanisms after transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in rats.

Results

2.1.

Physiological parameters

120.5712.3; high AO diet, 135.474.2). However, DBP 24 h after
reperfusion was signiﬁcantly lower in the high AO diet group
than the vehicle group (vehicle, 111.2711.2 mmHg; normal
AO diet, 99.576.3; high AO diet, 88.479.5, po0.05 versus
vehicle) (Fig. 1).
Although rCBF rates among the three diet groups were not
signiﬁcantly different, rCBF seemed to be higher in the two
AO diet groups (vehicle, 79.5736.1%; normal AO diet,
82.6720.9; high AO diet, 91.2727.3; Fig. 2).

2.2.

As compared to the vehicle group (2.470.6), Bederson scores
showed an improvement in normal and high AO diet groups
(normal AO diet, 1.770.7; po0.05; high AO diet, 1.670.7,
po0.01; Fig. 3A).
Compared with the vehicle group (75.9712.1 mm3), the AO
diet groups showed a reduction in the infarct volume (normal
AO, 67.5714.6 mm3; p¼ n.s. versus vehicle) with signiﬁcant
reductions in the high AO diet group (54.6710. 3 mm3; po0.05
versus vehicle; Fig. 3B). The examples of CV sections are
shown in Fig. 3C.

2.3.

Body weights were not signiﬁcantly different among the three
diet groups (vehicle, 270.5712.2 g; normal AO diet, 280.57
4.6 g; high AO diet, 273.7714.7 g). The time-dependent
changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood
pressure (DBP), and regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) are
shown in Table 1. SBP (vehicle, 124.477.6 mmHg; normal AO
diet, 121.577.8; high AO diet, 123.073.2) and DBP (vehicle,
95.774.4 mmHg; normal AO diet, 91.9711.2; high AO diet,
91.876.8) before tMCAO showed no signiﬁcant difference
between the three diet groups. SBP 24 h after reperfusion
also showed no signiﬁcant difference between the three
diet groups (vehicle, 151.276.5 mmHg; normal AO diet,

Inﬂammatory markers

Typical immunohistochemical stains for monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), ionized calcium-binding adapter
molecule 1 (Iba-1), and TNFα at the peri-ischemic areas are
shown in Fig. 4. Compared with the vehicle group (MCP-1,
186.3735.4/mm2; Iba-1, 127.1720.4; TNFα, 121.7728.4), the
normal AO diet group showed a slight reduction in the
number of positive cells for MCP-1 (177.1734.2/mm2), Iba-1
(116.4714.3), and TNFα (101.8719.2). On the other hand, the
high AO diet group showed signiﬁcant reductions in the
number of positive cells for all three inﬂammatory markers
(MCP-1, 131.1739.2/mm2; Iba-1, 77.3721.4; TNFα, 79.9730.0;
po0.05 versus vehicle).
Staining for Sirt-1 also is shown in Fig. 4 (bottom).
Although there was a tendency toward an increase in Sirt-1
staining, the change was not signiﬁcant among the three
diet groups (vehicle, 157.0733.3/mm2; normal AO diet,
161.2752.4; high AO diet, 189.0737.4).

Discussion

It appeared that an AO diet improved the motor function
(Fig. 3A), reduced the infarct volume (Fig. 3B and C), and
reduced oxidative (Fig. 4) and inﬂammatory (Fig. 5) markers,
except for Sirt-1 (Fig. 5, bottom). Oxidative stress plays an
important role in ischemic stroke (Abe et al., 1995). ROS were
generated after tMCAO, which increased brain injury by direct
damage of cellar lipids, proteins, and DNA or indirect damage
by affecting cellular signaling and gene regulation (Schaller
and Graf, 2004; Zhang et al., 2004). Normal and high AO diets
contained incremental doses of anti-oxidants such as catechins, proanthocyanidins, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, copper,
selenium, and chromium, and thus ameliorated the oxidative
stress (Ghosh and Scheepens, 2009).
In the present study, 4-HNE, AGEs, and 8-OHdG were selected
as oxidative stress markers. 4-HNE is one lipid peroxidative
product that was produced by ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury
in brain (Eaton et al., 1999). AGEs are end products of protein

36

peroxidation related to ischemic stroke (Zimmerman et al., 1995).
8-OHdG is a well-known oxidative DNA marker as previously
described (Lukic-Panin et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2004). A reduction

of peroxidative damages to lipids, proteins, and DNA following
ischemic stroke (Fig. 3).
In the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, the inﬂammatory
response is another important factor in the deterioration and
primary ischemic damage during the later stage (Dirnagl et al.,
1999). Post ischemic inﬂammation disrupts neurovasculature
and allows inﬂammatory cells to enter into the brain, which
contributes to neuronal injury (del Zoppo, 2006). Polyphenols also
have been shown to have anti-inﬂammatory effects (Ghosh and
Scheepens, 2009), which were conﬁrmed in the present study
with staining for MCP-1, Iba-1, and TNF-α (Fig. 5). MCP-1 activates
microglia to be Iba-1 positive, and increases inﬁltration of
macrophages to promote inﬂammation through TNF-α production. It seemed that an AO diet inhibited such inﬂammatory
changes in the rat brain following tMCAO (Fig. 4).
Sirt-1 is known to be a longevity gene with various effects
including anti-oxidation, anti-inﬂammation, glycolytic metabolism, lipid metabolism, and protection against brain damage
from ischemia (Hernandez-Jimenez et al., 2013; Potente and
Dimmeler, 2008). Resveratrol is a polyphenol that activates Sirt1 (Villalba and Alcain, 2012). It makes sense to ﬁnd that the
present study did not show a signiﬁcant Sirt-1 activation (Fig. 5,
bottom) because the preset AO diet contained only catechins and
proanthocyanidins but not resveratrol. The present study also
showed that catechins and proanthocyanidins improved
ischemic brain damage without activating the Sirt-1 pathway
(Fig. 5).
In conclusion, our present study demonstrated that an AO
diet showed an advantage in reducing oxidative and inﬂammatory brain damage following tMCAO, while improving both
clinical symptoms and infarct volume. Increased improvement of cerebral infarction in high AO groups compared with
the normal AO groups suggests a main anti-oxidative effect
greater than vitamins or minerals. The present study suggests that an AO diet has potential to improve ischemic
stroke damage through the anti-oxidative and antiinﬂammatory effects of polyphenols.

Experimental procedures

4.1.

Diet

All rats had free access to the diet (MF, Oriental Yeast, Tokyo,
Japan). The vehicle diet contained 359 kcal, 23.1 g protein, 5.1 g
fat, vitamins (C, 4 mg; E, 9.1 mg; A, 1283 IU; B1, 2.05 mg; B2,
1.10 mg; B6, 0.87 mg; B12, 5.5 μg; D, 137 IU; K, 8 μg; niacin, 0.04 mg;
pantothenic acid, 2.45 mg; and folic acid, 170 μg), and
minerals (Na, 190 mg; K, 900 mg; Ca, 1070 mg; Mg, 240 mg;
P, 830 mg; Fe, 10.6 mg; Mn, 4.84 mg; Zn, 4.89 mg; Cu, 0.78 mg)
per 100 g. We produced the following experimental diets: vehicle
diet; a normal dose anti-oxidative nutrient rich enteral diet
Fig. 3 – Bederson scores 24 h after reperfusion of the vehicle,

Bederson scores were signiﬁcantly improved in the normal
and high AO diet groups (npo0.05, nnpo0.05 versus vehicle)
and infarct volumes were signiﬁcantly reduced in the high
AO diet group (*po0.05 versus vehicle).

(normal AO diet); and a high dose AO diet (high AO diet). The
vehicle diet consisted of a daily dose of 0.5% methylcellulose
(MC) plus glucose (100 kcal/100 mL) without any electrolytes or
polyphenols. The normal AO diet was supplemented with a daily
dose of 0.5% MC and a small amount of polyphenol (catechin

and 10 times the polyphenols (catechin 387.5 mg/100 mL,
proanthocyanidin 190 mg/100 mL) of the normal AO diet. The
normal and high AO diets shared common components such as
glucose (100 kcal), protein (5 g), fat (2.8 g), carbohydrate (14.0 g),

vitamins (C, 100 mg; E, 5.0 mg; A, 233 IU; B1, 0.18 mg; B2, 0.2 mg;
B6, 0.30 mg; B12, 0.32 μg; D, 40 IU; K, 8 μg; niacin, 1.6 mg;
pantothenic acid, 0.96 mg; and folic acid, 38 μg), and minerals
(Na, 130 mg; Cl, 80 mg; K, 136 mg; Ca, 63 mg; Mg, 31 mg; P, 88 mg;
Fe, 0.88 mg; I, 13 μg; Mn, 0.335 mg; Zn, 1.5 mg; Cu, 0.15 mg; Se,
5 μg; and Cr, 6 μg) per 100 mL. In addition to the above diet
delivered by oral gavage (1 kcal/day), rats in all three groups
consumed a pellet diet (about 20 g/day¼72 kcal/day) with sufﬁcient energy and basic nutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrate).

4.2.

Animals and focal cerebral ischemia

Nine-week-old male Wistar rats were obtained from Japan
SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan). Rats were maintained for a week in
a temperature-regulated room (21–23 1C) with a 12-h light/
dark cycle. All experimental procedures were approved by the
Animal Committee of the Okayama University Graduate
School of Medicine (OKU-2013378). At age 10 weeks, the
animals were divided into three groups: vehicle diet (1 mL/
day), normal AO diet (1 mL/day), and high AO diet (1 mL/day)
groups (n¼ 6 in each groups). A small burr hole (1.5 mm in
diameter) was drilled at 2 mm posterior and 5 mm lateral to
the bregma for the measurement of regional cerebral blood
ﬂow (rCBF). Body weight, blood pressure (BP), and pulse rate
were measured before tMCAO, and 24 h after reperfusion;
measurements for BP and pulse rate were performed using a
tail-cuff (Softron BP98A, Tokyo, Japan).
From age 10 weeks, drugs were administered by oral
gavage every day for 14 days. At age 12 W, animals were
anesthetized with a nitrous oxide/oxygen/isoﬂurane mixture
(69%/30%/1%) during surgery with an inhalation mask. The
right middle cerebral artery (MCA) was occluded by insertion
of a 4–0 surgical nylon thread with silicon coating through the
common carotid artery as described previously (Deguchi
et al., 2012). Body temperature was maintained at 3770.3 1C
using a heating pad during the surgical treatment. After
90 min of tMCAO, the ﬁlament was gently removed. rCBF
was measured using a laser-Doppler ﬂowmeter (FLO-C1;
Omegawave, Tokyo, Japan) before and during tMCAO, just
after reperfusion, and 24 h after reperfusion.
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, clinical scores were
measured using Benderson scores: 0, no observable deﬁcit; 1,
forelimb ﬂexion; 2, decreased resistance to lateral push; 3, same
behavior as grade 2 with circling (Bederson et al., 1986). Rats
were sacriﬁced under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital
(10 mg/250 g rat, i.p.). Rats were then transcardially perfused
with heparinized saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). The whole brain was
removed and immersed in the same ﬁxation for 1 day at 4 1C
and washed with PBS. The tissues were transferred into graded
sucrose solution of 10%, 20%, and 30%, sequentially, then
embedded for optimal cutting temperature (OCT) in powdered
dry ice, and stored at 80 1C until use. Twenty micrometerthick coronal brain sections were cut in a cryostat at  18 1C and
mounted on a silane-coated glass slide.

4.3.

Histology and immunohistochemistry

For evaluation of the infarct volume, brain sections were
stained with cresyl violet (CV) and were then examined by

microscopy (SZX-12; Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). The
sections were made at 2, 0,  2,  4, 6 mm from the bregma.
Infarct volumes were measured in ﬁve sections by pixel
counting using a computer program for Photoshop CS5, and
the volume was calculated.
We performed immunohistochemistry for 4-HNE, AGEs,
8-OHdG, MCP-1, Iba-1, TNF-α, and Sirt-1. After ﬁxation with
4% formaldehyde, sections were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen
peroxidase/methanol for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity and incubated with bovine serum albumin for
1 h. Sections were then incubated at 4 1C overnight with
primary antibody for 4-HNE (1:50; MHN-100P; JaICA, Shizuoka,
Japan), AGEs (1:200; Transgenic, Kobe Japan), 8-OHdG (1:50;
MOG-020; JaICA, Shizuoka, Japan), MCP-1 (1:50; ab7202;
Abcam Cambridge, UK), Iba-1 (1:100; ab5076; Abcam Cambridge, UK), TNF-α (1:40; AF-510-NA; R&D Systems; Abingdon,
UK), and Sirt-1 (1:500; sc-15404; Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA). The next day, the sections were incubated with the
following biotinylated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room
temperature: biotinylated anti-mouse monoclonal antibody
(1:500; Vector Laboratories) for 4-HNE, AGEs, and 8-OHdG;
biotinylated anti-goat monoclonal antibody (1:500; Vector
Laboratories) for TNFα and Iba-1; and biotinylated antirabbit monoclonal antibody (1:500; Vector Laboratories) for
MCP-1 and Sirt-1. The sections were then incubated with
avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector
Laboratories) for 30 min and visualized with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride.

Statistical analysis

All results are presented as mean7SD. Statistical analyses
were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and
Tukey–Kramer post-comparison. Differences with a probability value of po0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
