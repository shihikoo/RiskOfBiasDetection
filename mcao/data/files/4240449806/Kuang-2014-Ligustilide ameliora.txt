Blocking TLR4/peroxiredoxin (Prx6) signaling is proposed to be a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic
stroke because extracellular Prx6 released from ischemic cells may act as an endogenous ligand for TLR4
and initiate destructive immune responses in ischemic brain. Our previous studies showed that
ligustilide (LIG) exerted antineuroinﬂammatory and neuroprotective effects against ischemic insult,
but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated whether the TLR4/Prx6 pathway
is involved in the protective effect of LIG against postischemic neuroinﬂammation and brain injury
induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. Intraperitoneal LIG administration
(20 and 40 mg/kg/day) at reperfusion onset after MCAO resulted in a reduction of brain infarct size and
improved neurological outcome over 72 h. LIG-induced neuroprotection was accompanied by improvement of neuropathological alterations, including neuron loss, astrocyte and microglia/macrophage
activation, neutrophil and T-lymphocyte invasion, and regulation of inﬂammatory mediators expression.
Moreover, LIG signiﬁcantly inhibited the expression and extracellular release of Prx6 and activation of
TLR4 signaling, reﬂected by decreased TLR4 expression, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
phosphorylation, and transcriptional activity of NF-κB and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in the ischemic brain. Our results demonstrate that LIG may provide an early and direct
neuroprotection by inhibiting TLR4/Prx6 signaling and subsequent immunity and neuroinﬂammation
after cerebral ischemia. These ﬁndings support the translational potential of blocking TLR4/Prx6
signaling for the treatment of ischemic stroke.

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of adult morbidity and morta`lity worldwide. The restoration of blood ﬂow and reoxygenation
with thrombolytics or interventional recanalization in occluded
cerebral blood vessels is a regularly applied approach for acute
ischemic stroke treatment [1,2]. However, reperfusion therapy has
achieved limited clinical success because of the narrow therapeutic
time window and potential neurological injury caused by reperfusion, such as blood–brain barrier disruption, hemorrhagic transformation, and massive brain edema [2]. Despite the complicated
pathogenesis of ischemic stroke, extensive experimental and clinical
evidence indicates that neuroinﬂammation is an essential event for
the primary and secondary progression of brain ischemia/reperfusion injury [3,4]. Perhaps surprisingly, various neuroprotective

agents that target postischemic neuroinﬂammatory responses, such
as anti-intracellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) antibody
(enlimomab) and cyclooxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin and
paracetemol), have shown disappointing outcomes in ischemic
stroke in clinical trials [5]. Therefore, the mechanisms that underlie
postischemic inﬂammation cascades are under extensive investigation for the development of innovative neuroprotective therapies for
ischemic stroke.
Emerging evidence suggests that immunomodulation plays
a pivotal role in postischemic neuroinﬂammation, which could be
a consequence of Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation [6–9]. Toll-like
receptors are a family of highly conserved innate immunity receptors that recognize highly preserved structures in pathogens, called
pathogen-associated molecular patterns, but they also recognize
danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are released
from aseptic damaged tissues, such as the ischemic brain [10].
Accumulated evidence suggests that the blockade of TLR4 or its
endogenous DAMP signaling may be a novel therapeutic strategy

for poststroke neuroinﬂammation and brain injury [4,6,8–10]. Of
the TLRs, TLR4 is intimately associated with experimental and
clinical outcome in ischemic stroke [6,11–14]. Toll-like receptor
4 is constitutively expressed in various brain cells and blood-borne
immune cells [15,16]. Cerebral ischemia stress robustly induces
TLR4 expression and the extracellular release of endogenous ligands
for TLR4 from necrotic and dying neural cells in the ischemic brain,
thereby activating the TLR4 signaling pathway, which enhances
both innate and adaptive immunity and further promotes postischemic inﬂammation and brain infarction [7–9]. Recent studies
revealed that diverse DAMPs released extracellularly after stroke
have a differential temporal proﬁle. The extracellular release of
peroxiredoxin family proteins (Prx’s) mainly occurs 12–24 h after
stroke onset, and among them Prx5 and Prx6 are newly identiﬁed
TLR4-dependent inducers of inﬁltrating macrophage activation and
the subsequent production of inﬂammatory mediators from invading T cells in the ischemic brain [17,18]. Prx6-expressing astrocytes
are known to be the most abundant brain cell type, outnumbering
Prx5-expressing neurons by at least 10-fold. Therefore, extracellular
Prx6 is probably an important target among the Prx’s for immunomodulation and neuroinﬂammation after ischemic stroke.
Ligustilide (3-butylidene-4,5-dihydrophthalide, LIG) is a characteristic phthalide component of various medicinal Umbelliferae
plants, such as Radix Angelicae sinensis and Ligusticum chuanxiong
[19]. Our previous studies showed that LIG exerts potent neuroprotective effects against various cerebral ischemic insults, such
as permanent focal brain ischemia and chronic forebrain hypoperfusion in rats, accompanied by the inhibition of inﬂammatory
responses in the ischemic brain [20,21]. Furthermore, we observed
an inhibitory effect of LIG on the proinﬂammatory response
induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a natural ligand for TLR4) in
primary rat cerebral microglia [22]. To explore the translational
potential of blocking TLR4/Prx6 and molecular mechanism that
underlies the neuroprotective effect of LIG in cerebral ischemia,
this study explored whether immunomodulation and the TLR4/
Prx6 signaling pathway are involved in the protective effect of LIG
against postischemic neuroinﬂammation and brain injury in focal
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats.

Material and methods
Reagents
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) was purchased from
Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The primary antibodies used
in this study, including neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN), glial
ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Iba-1, Prx6, CD3, TLR4, extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), phosphorylated ERK1/2
at Thr202/Tyr204 (p-ERK1/2), phosphorylated STAT3 at Tyr705
(p-STAT3), the p65 subunit of NF-κB (NF-κB p65), β-actin, and
lamin B, are summarized in Table 1. 2-(4-Amidinophenyl)-6indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride (DAPI) was obtained from
Boster (Wuhan, China). Trizol reagent was purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The DeadEnd ﬂuorimetric TUNEL system was obtained from Precision Design for Life
(Beijing, China). The speciﬁc primer pairs for polymerase chain
reaction were obtained from the Genomics Institute (Beijing,
China) and are listed in Table 2. All of the other reagents were
obtained from local commercial sources. Ligustilide was prepared
as described previously, and the purity was examined based on the
percentage of total peak areas by high-performance liquid chromatography [23]. In this study, LIG (purity 499%) was freshly
prepared in 3% Tween 80 before use.

Animals
Speciﬁc-pathogen-free male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–300 g
body wt) were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal
Technology Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). The animals were kept under
a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle with controlled temperature and
humidity and given food and water ad libitum. All of the animal
procedures were performed according to China Animal Welfare
Legislation and the Guidelines of Laboratory Animal Care and Use of
Sichuan University.
Induction of focal cerebral ischemia and pharmacological treatments
Transient focal ischemia was induced by right middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats using the intraluminal ﬁlament
technique as described previously [21,24]. Two hours after focal
cerebral ischemia induced by MCAO, the thread was carefully
withdrawn to establish reperfusion. The sham-operated controls
underwent similar surgical procedures without occlusion of the
middle cerebral artery. At the beginning of reperfusion after 2 h
MCAO, LIG (20 and 40 mg/kg) or volume-matched vehicle was
injected intraperitoneally once daily according to our previous
study with modiﬁcation [21].
Examination of neurological deﬁcits
Neurological impairment after ischemic insult was evaluated using
a neurobehavioral test that was scored on a 5-point scale: 0, no
signiﬁcant deﬁcits; 1, failure to extend left forepaw fully; 2, circling to
the left; 3, falling to the left; 4, inability to walk spontaneously
combined with depressed levels of consciousness. Neurobehavioral
testing was performed 24, 48, and 72 h after reperfusion following
ischemia induction by one examiner who was blind to the experimental groups [24,25].
Determination of infarct volume
Twenty-four or 72 h after MCAO, eight rats from each group
after the neurobehavioral test were euthanized by rapid decapitation, and the brains were rapidly removed and frozen at  20 1C
for 15 min. Coronal brain sections of 2-mm thickness were stained
with 0.5% TTC at 37 1C for 15 min, followed by ﬁxation with 4%
formaldehyde for 24 h. Infarct volume measurements were performed by an investigator who was blind to the treatment groups
as previously described [21,24].
Immunohistochemical staining
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, six rats from each group after
the neurobehavioral test were deeply anesthetized and perfused
through the heart with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The ischemic brain tissue at
the level of bregma þ0.7 to 4.3 mm in the ipsilateral hemisphere was obtained and used for the determination of immunohistochemical staining as described previously [24]. Brieﬂy, the
parafﬁn-embedded brain sections (5 μm) were rinsed with 3%
H2O2 for 15 min to block endogenous peroxide activity and
incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min to block
nonspeciﬁc binding. The sections were then incubated with
various primary antibodies (Table 1) overnight at 4 1C. Primary
antibodies were recognized by a biotinylated secondary antibody
at 37 1C for 1 h and detected by the avidin–biotin complex
kit (Boster) at 37 1C for 1 h. Immunoreactions were visualized
using 3,30 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. Counterstaining
was performed using hematoxylin. Negative control sections
were stained only with secondary antibody to control for possible

nonspeciﬁc staining. For the semiquantitative analysis of the
immunohistochemical results, three sections from each brain, with
each section containing three microscopic ﬁelds from the ischemic
boundary zone (penumbra) in the cerebral cortex or striatum,
were digitized under a 40  objective [24]. The immunoreactivity
of the target proteins was quantiﬁed based on the integrated
optical density of immunostaining per ﬁeld using ImagePro Plus
6.0 software [23,26].
To determine the extracellular release of Prx6 in the ischemic
cortex, the parafﬁn-embedded brain sections were ﬁrst stained
with the DeadEnd ﬂuorimetric apoptosis detection system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for TUNEL staining according to the
manufacturer's instructions, followed by Prx6 immunohistochemical staining. Brieﬂy, after TUNEL staining, the sections were
treated with 0.4% Triton for 30 min at room temperature, blocked
with 5% goat serum, and incubated overnight at 4 1C with Prx6
antibody (1:100). After three washes with PBS, the sections were
incubated with rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (Zhongshan Jingqiao, Beijing, China) for 1 h at 37 1C. After
the sections were washed, nuclear staining was performed using
DAPI solution (Boster). Prx6 localization was observed using a
ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon, NI-U), and photomicrographs
were acquired using a 40  objective and processed using SPOT
advanced software 4.6 (SPOT Imaging Solutions, Sterling Heights,
MI, USA).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, four rats from each group after
the neurobehavioral test were deeply anesthetized and perfused
through the heart with cold PBS. Ischemic brain tissue at the level

of bregma 2.56 to  4.3 mm in the ipsilateral hemisphere was
obtained, and total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent and
processed for cDNA, followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as described previously [23]. The speciﬁc
primer pairs (Beijing Genomics Institute, Beijing, China) are listed
in Table 2 [27-32]. The mRNA levels of inﬂammatory mediators
were normalized to the value of β-actin, and the results are
expressed as fold change of the threshold cycle (Ct) value relative
ΔΔ
to sham-operated controls using the 2  Ct method.
Western blot
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, four rats from each group after
the neurobehavioral test were deeply anesthetized and perfused
through the heart with cold PBS. Ischemic brain tissue at the level
of bregma þ0.7 to  2.6 mm in the ipsilateral hemisphere was
obtained, and total protein and nuclear protein were isolated as
described previously [24]. To assess Prx6 content in cerebrospinal
ﬂuid (CSF) after the behavioral test, the rats were anesthetized 24
or 72 h after reperfusion, and CSF was collected from the cisterna
magna as described previously [17]. Only clear CSF was used for
analysis. Equal amounts of brain tissue protein or 20 ml CSF were
separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene ﬂuoride
membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membrane was
then incubated with a primary antibody (Table 1) overnight at
4 1C, followed by incubation with an appropriate horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zhongshan-Golden
Bridge, Beijing, China) for 1 h at room temperature and enhanced
chemiluminescence assay using an ECL kit (Millipore). The optical
density of each band was determined using Gel Pro Analyzer 6.0

168

(Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). The immunoblot results
were quantitatively analyzed densitometrically and are expressed
as relative optical density compared with the sham-operated
group.
Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as the mean 7 SEM and were analyzed
using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey test. The
statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 software. Values
of p o 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Ligustilide improved cerebral ischemia outcome
This study evaluated the effects of intraperitoneal LIG administration on ischemic stroke outcome 24 or 72 h after 2 h MCAO by
evaluating brain infarct volume and neurological deﬁcits in rats
(Fig. 1). Because the rats in the sham-operated group underwent a
similar surgical procedure without MCAO, no infarct area was
found in this group. In the vehicle-treated MCAO group, however,

the ischemic zone was identiﬁed as a distinct pale-stained area in
the right cortex and striatum in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere, with an infarct volume of 19.0 71.4% of the entire brain
volume 24 h after reperfusion and 16.9 7 5.9% of the entire brain
volume 72 h after reperfusion. Postischemic treatment with 20
or 40 mg/kg LIG signiﬁcantly decreased the infarct volume
to 11.8 72.4 and 7.97 4.1%, respectively, 24 h after MCAO, and
40 mg/kg LIG effectively decreased the infarct volume to 4.6 72.7%
72 h after MCAO compared with vehicle-treated controls (p o
0.05 and p o 0.01, respectively; Fig. 1C). These results suggest that
LIG dose-dependently protected against both acute and delayed
brain damage induced by cerebral ischemia.
Consistent with the improvement of cerebral infarcts, postischemic treatment with LIG also effectively improved behavioral deﬁcits after transient MCAO evaluated by neurological
deﬁcit scores (Fig. 2). Higher neurological deﬁcit scores were
generally associated with more severe motor impairment. As
shown in Fig. 2, the neurobehavioral tests revealed no neurobehavioral dysfunction symptoms in the sham-operated group
24 or 72 h after MCAO; therefore, these animals had a neurological score of 0. However, the neurological scores in the vehicletreated MCAO group increased to 3.1 7 0.2 and 2.6 7 0.5 24 and
72 h after ischemia, respectively, which was attributable to brain

changes, reﬂected by a reduction in neuron loss, glia activation,
and leukocyte invasion.

Ligustilide attenuated neuropathological changes induced by cerebral
ischemia

We further investigated the effects of LIG on the expression of
inﬂammatory mediators in the ischemic brain 24 h after MCAO
using qPCR (Fig. 4). Increases were found in the mRNA levels of
the proinﬂammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α),
interleukin-1β (IL-1β), ICAM-1, matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP9), interferon γ (IFN-γ), and interleukin 17 (IL-17) in the ischemic
brain (p o 0.01). A slight increase in the mRNA levels of the antiinﬂammatory cytokine IL-10 was observed in the MCAO group
compared with the sham-operated group. Consistent with the
immunohistochemistry results, in which LIG effectively ameliorated activated glia and invading leukocytes in the ischemic brain
(Fig. 3), 20 and 40 mg/kg LIG dose-dependently decreased the
mRNA levels of these proinﬂammatory mediators (p o 0.05 and
p o 0.01 vs MCAO group, respectively). Notably, LIG at doses of
20 and 40 mg/kg signiﬁcantly enhanced the mRNA level of IL-10
(p o 0.05 and p o 0.01 vs MCAO group, respectively). The present
results indicate that LIG decreased the expression of proinﬂammatory mediators from parenchymal glia and inﬁltrating leukocytes and increased the expression of anti-inﬂammatory cytokines
from regulatory T (Treg) cells, suggesting that the inhibitory effect
of LIG on postischemic neuroinﬂammation is probably associated
with its neuroimmunomodulatory properties in both innate and
adaptive immunity.

Twenty-four hours after 2 h MCAO, pathological alterations in
the brain were examined immunohistochemically. Immunostaining with NeuN was performed without nuclear counterstaining.
Fig. 3A shows that the sham-operated rats had a large number of
NeuN-immunopositive neurons, which were greatly decreased in
the ischemic cortex and striatum in the vehicle-treated MCAO
group. This decrease was attributable to neuron damage induced
by cerebral ischemia (p o 0.01). Consistent with the ischemic
stroke outcome (Figs. 1 and 2), postischemic administration
of LIG dose-dependently increased NeuN-positive neurons in the
ischemic brain compared with the MCAO group. Ligustilide at a
dose of 20 mg/kg signiﬁcantly increased the number of neurons in
the ischemic cortex (p o 0.01), and 40 mg/kg LIG markedly
increased the number of neurons in both the ischemic cortex
and the striatum (p o 0.05 and p o 0.01, respectively).
Numerous studies have demonstrated that both activated
parenchymal glia and inﬁltrating leukocytes play a crucial role in
the development of postischemic neuroinﬂammation and neuron
damage. Immunostaining for GFAP was used to assess activated
astrocytes induced by ischemia. In this study, vehicle-treated
MCAO rats had markedly enhanced GFAP immunoreactivity in
the ischemic cortex and striatum compared with the shamoperated group. Such immunoreactivity was dose-dependently
decreased by 20 and 40 mg/kg LIG treatment (p o 0.05 and
p o 0.01, respectively; Fig. 3B). Additionally, the immunoreactivity
of Iba-1, a speciﬁc marker of resident microglia and invading
macrophages, was analyzed to determine the effect of LIG on the
activation of these innate immune cells. As shown in Fig. 3C,
a signiﬁcant increase in Iba-1 immunostaining was observed in the
ischemic cortex and striatum in the vehicle-treated MCAO group
compared with the sham-operated group. This increase in Iba-1
immunostaining was signiﬁcantly decreased by 40 mg/kg LIG
(p o 0.01). Finally, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in invading
myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive neutrophils and CD3-positive T
lymphocytes in the ischemic cortex and striatum in the vehicletreated MCAO group compared with the sham-operated group,
which was effectively decreased by LIG treatment (p o 0.05 and
p o 0.01, respectively; Fig. 3D and E). Altogether, the present
results indicate that postischemia LIG treatment effectively
ameliorates transient brain ischemia-induced neuropathological

Ligustilide improved the expression of cerebral inﬂammatory
mediators after ischemia

Ligustilide reduced the extracellular release of Prx6 in the ischemic
brain
Increased extracellular Prx5 and Prx6 were reported to be the
major DAMPs that induce inﬁltrating macrophage activation and
the subsequent production of cytokines from invading T cells after
cerebral ischemia [18]. Therefore, we ﬁrst examined the effects of
LIG on the Prx5 and Prx6 expression in the ischemic brain by
Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A and Supplementary
Fig. 1, the expression levels of Prx5 and Prx6 in ischemic brain
were markedly increased in the MCAO group compared with those
in the sham-operated controls (p o 0.01), which were decreased
with LIG treatment in a dose-dependent manner (p o 0.05 or p o
0.01) 24 h after MCAO. Moreover, it was reported that the extracellular release of Prx6 from ischemic brain cells was timedependent [18]; therefore, we assayed the effect of LIG on the
release of Prx6 into CSF by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 5B
and C, Prx6 content in CSF both 24 and 72 h after MCAO
was markedly increased in the MCAO group compared with

sham-operated controls (p o 0.01), and this increase in CSF Prx6
was much higher at 24 h (11.773.1 times that of the sham group)
than at 72 h (6.0 71.5 times the sham group) after reperfusion. Postischemic treatment with 20 or 40 mg/kg LIG dosedependently decreased the CSF Prx6 level to 7.47 0.8 and
2.3 71.2 times that of the sham group 24 h after MCAO, respectively, whereas 40 mg/kg LIG decreased the CSF Prx6 level to
1.870.7 times that of the sham group 72 h after MCAO (p o 0.05
and p o 0.01 vs MCAO group). Furthermore, the expression and
cellular localization of Prx6 were determined by immunoﬂuorescent staining in the ischemic brain 24 h after MCAO. Consistent
with previous reports [18], Prx6 immunoreactivity was barely
detectable in the sham-operated cortex, whereas strong Prx6
expression was observed around TUNEL-positive cells in the
ischemic cortex in the MCAO group, accompanied by Prx6 expression in the extracellular compartment of dead or dying cells
(Fig. 5D). Ligustilide (20 and 40 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated the immunoreactivity and extracellular localization of Prx6 in
the ischemic brain. These observations indicate that LIG attenuated both the intracellular expression and the extracellular release
of Prx6 in the ischemic brain. Our ﬁndings suggest that the
immunomodulatory effect of LIG on neuroinﬂammation is probably correlated with a direct protective effect on ischemic neural
cells, reducing the extracellular endogenous ligands of TLRs and
inhibiting TLR signaling pathways in transient MCAO rat brain.
Ligustilide inhibited TLR4 signaling in the ischemic brain
To elucidate the mechanism that underlies the immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects of LIG against ischemia/reperfusion brain injury, we further explored the potential effect of LIG on
the TLR4 signaling pathway in transient MCAO rat brain using

Western blot. As shown in Fig. 6, cerebral ischemia signiﬁcantly
induced TLR4 expression and the subsequent activation of its
signaling effectors, reﬂected by increased p-ERK and p-STAT3
and the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in the ischemic brain
in the MCAO group compared with sham controls (p o 0.01).
Ligustilide treatment at doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg dose-dependently inhibited the TLR4 signaling pathway in the ischemic brain
(p o 0.05 and p o 0.01, respectively), suggesting that the
neuroprotective effect of LIG is associated with inhibition of the
TLR4 signaling pathway in the ischemic brain.

Discussion
Despite intensive studies in the past 20 years, the pathogenesis
of neuroinﬂammation after ischemic stroke has not been fully
clariﬁed, thus causing slow progress in the development of
effective anti-inﬂammatory neuroprotectants [5]. Early clinical
epidemiological studies reported that chronic infections (e.g.,
Chlamydia pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori) increased the risk
of ischemic stroke, but causality remained unclear [33]. Emerging
evidence suggests that both innate and adaptive immunity, highly
regulated by TLR/DAMP signaling, play important roles in the
progression of postischemic neuroinﬂammation and brain injury
[7–9]. Distinct DAMPs released from ischemic brain cells have
gradually been identiﬁed [10,17,18]. The binding of DAMPs to TLRs
induces innate immune responses through the activation of TLR
signaling effectors, including mitogen-activated protein kinase
and the transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3, resulting in
the production of proinﬂammatory mediators [18,34–37]. The
inﬁltration of T lymphocytes into the infarcted boundary zone
occurs within 24 h, and T lymphocytes further accumulate 3 days

after reperfusion [38]. The upregulation of TLR signaling elicits
an adaptive immune response through the induction of the
neurotoxic cytokines IFN-γ and IL-17 and cerebroprotective IL-10
from invading T cells [37,39–42]. Therefore, immunomodulation
through TLR/DAMP signaling is a potential therapeutic approach
for neuroinﬂammation and brain injury after ischemic stroke.
In this study, we found that postischemic LIG administration
dose-dependently ameliorated cerebral infarction 24 and 72 h
after reperfusion and improved neurological outcome 72 h after
reperfusion, suggesting that LIG has efﬁcacy against acute and
delayed brain injury after ischemia/reperfusion. To conﬁrm the
neuroprotective property of LIG, we examined the effects of LIG
on cerebral histopathological changes 24 h after reperfusion
following ischemia. Consistent with previous studies [43–47], we
found that ischemia/reperfusion resulted in decreased NeuNimmunopositive neurons and increased GFAP-positive astrocytes,
Iba-1-positive microglia/macrophages, MPO-positive neutrophils,
and CD3-positive T lymphocytes in the ischemic cerebral cortex
and striatum. Ligustilide treatment effectively improved the overall postischemic neuropathological alterations. We further found
that LIG inhibited the mRNA levels of the proinﬂammatory
mediators TNF-α, IL-1β, MMP-9, ICAM-1, IFN-γ, and IL-17. Previous
studies demonstrated that brain cell necrosis after ischemia
triggers an inﬂammatory response and neuronal death through
the induction of neurotoxic cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-1β).

Postischemic upregulation of MMP-9 and ICAM-1 leads to leukocyte vascular adhesion and extravasation into ischemic brain
parenchyma, which exacerbates neuroinﬂammation and brain
injury through the excessive production of neurotoxic cytokines,
such as TNF-α and IL-1β from invading neutrophils, IFN-γ from
helper T cells, and IL-17 from γδT cells [8,9]. Additionally, Treg cells
have been increasingly regarded as key cerebroprotective modulators in inﬂammatory cascades after acute ischemic stroke by
counteracting the excessive production of proinﬂammatory cytokines and modulating the invasion or activation of lymphocytes
and microglia through IL-10 secretion [39,48]. Interestingly, LIG
dose-dependently increased the expression of IL-10 in the
ischemic brain, despite a decreased number of T lymphocytes in
the ischemic brain caused by LIG treatment. These results suggest
that LIG is likely to regulate the number or function of Treg cells.
Further investigations of the effect of LIG on Treg cells would
elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the neuroprotective effect of LIG against ischemic stroke. Collectively, the
present ﬁndings suggest that the neuroprotective effect of LIG is
associated with immunomodulation of the neuroinﬂammatory
response after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.
Peroxiredoxins were originally described as antioxidative
enzymes within brain cells that exert neuroprotective effects by
scavenging reactive oxygen species [49–52]. However, once
released from postischemic dead or dying neural cells, Prx’s lose

174

antioxidant capacity, act as DAMPs of TLRs, and induce innate and
adaptive immune responses by activating TLR signaling, triggering
neuroinﬂammation and brain lesions in ischemic stroke [18,53].
Notably, Prx’s consist of six mammalian isoforms with cell-typespeciﬁc expression patterns. Prx1 and Prx6 are expressed in
astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and Prx2–5 are mainly expressed
in neurons [54–56]. The results from a recent study identiﬁed
extracellular Prx5 and Prx6 as major TLR2/TLR4-dependent DAMPs
in aseptic inﬂammation after cerebral ischemia [18]. The present
study conﬁrmed increased Prx5 and Prx6 expression in ischemic
brain via Western blotting analysis as described previously [18].
Because Prx6-expressing astrocytes are the most abundant brain
cell type, we thus suppose that Prx6 may be an important target
for immunomodulation and neuroinﬂammation after ischemic
stroke. We further observed strongly increased immunoreactivity
and extracellular localization of Prx6 in the ischemic cortex 24 h
after reperfusion and greatly enhanced Prx6 content in CSF 24 h
after reperfusion and, to a lesser extent, 72 h after reperfusion.
However, LIG treatment dose-dependently inhibited the expression and extracellular release of Prx6 in the ischemic brain.
Considering the signiﬁcant neuroprotective effects of LIG against
oxidative injury induced by hydrogen peroxide and aging [23,57],
and ischemic insult, including transient focal ischemia in this
study, permanent focal ischemia, and cerebral hypoperfusion
[20,21], we propose that an early direct protective effect of LIG
on ischemic neural cells prevented ischemia stress-induced
expression and release of Prx6, thereby inhibiting immunological
and inﬂammatory responses associated with extracellular Prx6
after cerebral ischemia.
Toll-like receptor 4, the ﬁrst TLR identiﬁed in mammals, is the most
widely investigated pattern recognition receptor in ischemic stroke.
Studies of TLR4-knockout mice showed smaller infarct sizes and
improved neurological deﬁcits after cerebral ischemia [11,12]. Clinical
studies found that TLR4 polymorphisms were associated with
ischemic stroke outcome, and TLR4 expression was independently
associated with lesion volume and correlated with the intense
inﬂammatory response after ischemic stroke [6,14,58]. Recent studies
demonstrate that TLR4 signaling stimulated by brain ischemia leads to
the activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3 and
subsequent production of proinﬂammatory cytokines from resident/
inﬁltrating immune cells, resulting in potent postischemic neuroinﬂammation and brain injury [18,37]. In this study, we observed the
activation of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion-induced TLR4 signaling,
including enhanced TLR4 expression, and the activation of MAPK/ERK,
NF-κB, and STAT3. Systemic LIG treatment inhibited TLR4 signaling in
the ischemic brain. Several in vitro studies have reported the antiinﬂammatory properties of LIG in LPS-stimulated macrophages and
primary microglia [22,59]. An in vivo study showed that intravenous
LIG injection (20–80 mg/kg) protected rabbits against LPS-induced
endotoxic shock, with decreased levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and nitric
oxide, and partially restored function of the injured heart, liver, lungs,
and kidneys [60]. The present data suggest that the immunomodulatory effect of LIG is associated with the inhibition of TLR4 signaling,
contributing to its anti-inﬂammatory and neuroprotective effects
against cerebral ischemia.
In summary, LIG conferred a direct protective effect on the
ischemic brain whereby it inhibited TLR4/Prx6 signaling and subsequent immunity and neuroinﬂammation after cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion and beneﬁted experimental ischemic stroke outcome.
Our results support the translational potential of blocking TLR4/Prx6
signaling for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Moreover, considering
the relatively delayed release of Prx6 into the extracellular space after
ischemia compared with other DAMPs (e.g., high-mobility group box
1), speciﬁc agents that target extracellular Prx6 may be a therapeutic
approach with a prolonged therapeutic time window for the treatment of poststroke neuroinﬂammation and brain injury.
