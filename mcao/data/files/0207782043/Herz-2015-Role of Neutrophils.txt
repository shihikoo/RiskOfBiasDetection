Background and Purpose—Inflammation-related comorbidities contribute to stroke-induced immune responses and brain
damage. We previously showed that hyperlipidemia exacerbates ischemic brain injury, which is associated with elevated
peripheral and cerebral granulocyte numbers. Herein, we evaluate the contribution of neutrophils to the exacerbation of
ischemic brain injury.
Methods—Wild-type mice fed with a normal chow and ApoE knockout mice fed with a high cholesterol diet were
exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion. CXCR2 was blocked using the selective antagonist SB225002 (2 mg/kg)
or neutralizing CXCR2 antiserum. Neutrophils were depleted using an anti-Ly6G antibody. At 72 hours post ischemia,
immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to determine cerebral
tissue injury and immunologic changes in the blood, bone marrow, and brain. Functional outcome was assessed by
accelerated rota rod and tight rope tests at 4, 7, and 14 days post ischemia.
Results—CXCR2 antagonization reduced neurological deficits and infarct volumes that were exacerbated in hyperlipidemic
ApoE−/− mice. This effect was mimicked by neutrophil depletion. Cerebral neutrophil infiltration and peripheral
neutrophilia, which were increased on ischemia in hyperlipidemia, were attenuated by CXCR2 antagonization. This
downscaling of neutrophil responses was associated with increased neutrophil apoptosis and reduced levels of CXCR2,
inducible nitric oxide synthase, and NADPH oxidase 2 expression on bone marrow neutrophils.
Conclusions—Our data demonstrate a role of neutrophils in the exacerbation of ischemic brain injury induced by hyperlipidemia.
Accordingly, CXCR2 blockade, which prevents neutrophil recruitment into the brain, might be an effective option for stroke
treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia.   (Stroke. 2015;46:2916-2925. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.010620.)

nflammation is involved in stroke-induced brain damage.1
Besides local inflammatory processes in the ischemic brain,
stroke also provokes peripheral immune responses, which
influence secondary lesion growth and thus modulate longterm outcome. However, difficulties remain with regard to the
translation of inflammation-targeting therapeutic approaches
from preclinical to clinical studies,2 which might be because
of a neglect of comorbidities such as hyperlipidemia that is
frequently shown in patients with stroke. In fact, using dietary
and genetically induced models of hyperlipidemia, previous
studies demonstrated increased ischemic brain injury in hyperlipidemic mice.3–5 Underlying mechanisms involve alterations
of the blood–brain barrier.3 However, in addition to vascular pathology, hyperlipidemia triggers granulocytosis4,6 and
therefore adds another complexity to stroke-induced pathophysiology in hyperlipidemic mice hampering translation of

experimental findings into clinical practice. Emerging experimental and clinical evidences suggest that inflammatory factors outside the brain markedly influence stroke susceptibility
and outcome.7 Thus, we have previously shown that the combination of genetically and dietary-induced hyperlipidemia
leads to increased cerebral ischemic tissue injury, which is
accompanied by elevated levels of cerebral and circulating
granulocytes, albeit the causal link and the functional significance of these observations still remained elusive.4
Early infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils that
is preceded by activation of endothelial cells and expression
of chemokines and adhesion molecules is a major hallmark
of postischemic inflammation.8 Several reports, including our
own, suggest a detrimental role of brain infiltrating neutrophils
in ischemic tissue damage, for example, by releasing oxygen
radicals and inflammatory mediators.9–12 Besides adhesion

molecules, brain-derived chemokines facilitate immune cell
transmigration into the inflamed brain tissue. Neutrophils
are recruited through the specific interaction of CXCL1 and
CXCL2/3, which are strongly upregulated in ischemic brains,
with the neutrophil-specific receptor CXCR2.13 In addition
to enrollment of neutrophils, CXCR2 is supposed to mediate neutrophil release from the bone marrow into the blood in
response to inflammatory challenges.14
In view of our earlier findings,4 we were interested whether
neutrophils contribute to the exacerbation of ischemic brain
injury induced by hyperlipidemia. Therefore, we investigated
how the antagonization of the neutrophil-specific chemokine
receptor CXCR2 by means of a selective pharmacological
inhibitor or a neutralizing CXCR2 antiserum influenced ischemic brain injury and functional recovery in hyperlipidemic
ApoE−/− mice; furthermore, investigating consequences of
CXCR2 antagonization on peripheral neutrophil homeostasis
and phenotype, as well as on cerebral neutrophil infiltration.

Materials and Methods
Animals and Group Allocation
Experiments were performed in accordance to the Animal Research:
Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines and the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals with local government approval. Seven- to
8- week old wild-type (C57BL/6J, Harlan) and ApoE−/− male mice,
which were generated on the same C57BL/6 background, were either fed with a normal chow or a cholesterol-rich chow (Western diet;
TD.88137 Adjusted Calories Diet, Harlan Laboratories) for 6 weeks
and submitted to 20 minutes of left-sided middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) or sham surgery. Animals were randomly attributed
to treatment paradigms, and experimenters were blinded at all stages
of interventions and data analysis. The selective CXCR2 antagonist
SB225002 (2 mg/kg, Merck, Darmstadt) or vehicle (1% dimethyl sulfoxide in PBS) was injected intraperitoneally at 0, 24, and 48 hours
post ischemia. In other experiments, CXCR2 was specifically blocked
by intraperitoneal injection of a neutralizing rabbit anti-CXCR2
serum (300 µL) at 0, 24, and 48 hours post ischemia.15 In the latter
studies, normal rabbit serum served as control. In some experiments,
neutrophils were depleted by intraperitoneal injection of 200 µg antimouse Ly6G (Clone 1A8, BioXcell) 24 hours before and 24 hours
after ischemia. In these experiments, 200 µg of an isotype control antibody (Clone 2A3, BioXcell) was delivered as control.11 A total of 352
male mice (184 C57Bl/6J, 168 ApoE−/−) were examined. These mice
were randomly assigned to the following groups: wild-type normolipidemic/sham/vehicle (n=18), wild-type normolipidemic/MCAO/
vehicle (n=47), wild-type normolipidemic/sham/CXCR2 antagonist
(n=18), wild-type normolipidemic/MCAO/CXCR2 antagonist (n=47),
ApoE−/− hyperlipidemic/sham/vehicle (n=18), ApoE−/− hyperlipidemic/MCAO/vehicle (n=39), ApoE−/− hyperlipidemic/sham/CXCR2
antagonist (n=18), ApoE−/− hyperlipidemic/MCAO/CXCR2 antagonist (n=39), wild-type normolipidemic/MCAO/normal rabbit serum
(n=9), wild-type normolipidemic/MCAO/anti-CXCR2 (n=9), ApoE−/−
hyperlipidemic/MCAO/normal rabbit serum (n=9), ApoE−/− hyperlipidemic/MCAO/anti-CXCR2 (n=9), wild-type normolipidemic/
MCAO/isotype/vehicle (n=9), wild-type normolipidemic/MCAO/
isotype/CXCR2 antagonist (n=9), wild-type normolipidemic/MCAO/
anti-Ly6G/vehicle (n=9), wild-type normolipidemic/MCAO/antiLy6G/CXCR2 antagonist (n=9), ApoE−/− hyperlipidemic/MCAO/isotype/vehicle (n=9), ApoE−/− hyperlipidemic/MCAO/isotype/CXCR2
antagonist (n=9), ApoE−/− hyperlipidemic/MCAO/anti-Ly6G/vehicle
(n=9), and ApoE−/− hyperlipidemic/MCAO/anti-Ly6G/CXCR2 antagonist (n=9). The groups were further divided into 4 subgroups (1)
to assess functional deficits at 4, 7, and 14 days post ischemia; (2)
to determine infarct volumes and for immunohistochemistry; (3) to
quantify leukocyte subsets in blood, bone marrow, and brain at 3 days

post ischemia; and (4) to analyze mRNA expression via real-time
polymerase chain reaction in bone marrow neutrophils at 3 days post
ischemia. A detailed description on subgroup allocation and exclusion
criteria is given in the online-only Data Supplement.

Induction of Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Induction of stroke was performed using the intraluminal monofilament occlusion model as described previously.4 A detailed description is given in the online-only Data Supplement.

Analysis of Poststroke Motor Coordination Deficits
Assessment of motor coordination deficits was performed on days
4, 7, and 14 using the rota rod and the tight rope test as previously
described.16 Details are given in the online-only Data Supplement.

Analysis of Postischemic Tissue Injury and
Immunohistochemistry
For infarct volume measurement and immunohistochemical analysis, mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold PBS at 72 hours
post ischemia. Brains were removed and fresh-frozen on dry ice. To
determine infarct volume, coronal cryostat brain sections (20 μm
thick) taken at 400-μm intervals between +2 mm up to −4.4 mm
from bregma were stained with cresyl violet. For assessment of cell
death, endothelial activation, neutrophil infiltration, and oxidative
DNA damage, cryostat sections taken at the level of bregma were
used for immunohistochemistry according to published protocols.4,17
A detailed description of stainings and quantifications is given in the
online-only Data Supplement.

Processing of Peripheral Blood, Bone Marrow, and
Brain Tissues for Flow Cytometry Analysis
Isolation of single-cell suspension for flow cytometry analysis was performed as previously described.4 Briefly, animals were euthanized by
intraperitoneal injections of chloralhydrate (200 mg/kg body weight).
Blood specimens were collected into EDTA-coated collection tubes
by puncture of the inferior vena cava followed by transcardial perfusion with ice-cold PBS. Brains were dissected and hemispheres divided into ipsilesional and contralesional parts. Bone marrow from
femurs and tibiae was flushed with PBS. A detailed description of
further single-cell isolation, staining procedures, antibody cocktails,
and gating strategies is given in the online-only Data Supplement
(Methods and Table I in the online-only Data Supplement).

Gene Expression Analysis of Sorted Neutrophils by
Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction
For gene expression studies, ex vivo isolated bone marrow cells were
sorted for the neutrophil-specific antigen Ly6G using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS). Total RNA was extracted from cell lysates
(Promega, Madison) transcribed to complementary DNA followed by
real-time polymerase chain reaction. Details on the experimental conditions and measurements, as well as primer sequences, are given in
the online-only Data Supplement (Methods and Table II in the onlineonly Data Supplement).

Statistics
Numbers of animals to detect infarct size (n=9) and functional deficits
(n=12) were determined via a priori sample size calculations (effect
size f [by ANOVA] of 0.6 for infarct size, and 0.5 for functional deficits
with α=0.05, β=0.2). Results are presented as mean±SD. Differences
between 2 groups were assessed by the 2-tailed Student t test.
Differences across multiple groups were analyzed using 2- or 3-way
ANOVA with phenotype (normolipidemic wild-type versus hyperlipidemic ApoE−/−), experimental intervention (sham versus MCAO), or
treatment (vehicle versus CXCR2 antagonist) as independent factors
followed by post hoc Bonferroni tests for pairwise comparisons. In all
analyses, P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
CXCR2 Inhibition Promotes Functional Recovery
and Reduces Ischemia-Induced Cerebral Tissue
Injury in Hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− Mice
We and others have recently shown that induction of hyperlipidemia by means of a cholesterol-rich chow is associated
with exacerbation of ischemic injury in ApoE−/− mice.4,5 Motor
coordination deficits assessed in the rota rod and the tight rope
test, which were aggravated by hyperlipidemia in ApoE−/−
mice, were markedly improved by CXCR2 antagonization

≤14 days post ischemia (Figure 1A and 1B). Administration
of the selective CXCR2 inhibitor SB225002 did not affect
ischemic brain injury in normolipidemic wild-type mice, but
reversed the increased brain injury in hyperlipidemic ApoE−/−
mice (Figure 1C and 1D). This effect was mimicked by a
neutralizing CXCR2 antiserum15 (Figure 2A). To exclude the
possibility that 72 hours was too late to detect differences in
brain injury of normolipidemic mice, we also analyzed infarct
volume at 24 hours post ischemia. Again, infarct volume was
not altered by CXCR2 deactivation (Figure I in the onlineonly Data Supplement).

Figure 2. Anti-CXCR2 treatment results in similar neuroprotection
as SB225002 whose neuroprotective capacity is abrogated in
neutrophil-depleted hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice. Infarct volumes
were determined in ischemic wild-type mice fed with normal
chow (normolipidemic) or ApoE−/− mice fed with high cholesterol
diet (hyperlipidemic) which received either anti-CXCR2 serum or
normal rabbit serum (NRS) at 0, 24, and 48 hours post ischemia
(A; n=8–9). For neutrophil depletion, normolipidemic wild-type
and hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice were treated with anti-Ly6G
or isotype control antibody 24 hours before and 24 hours post
ischemia (B). The CXCR-2 inhibitor SB225002 (2 mg/kg, CXCR2
antagonist) or vehicle (1% dimethyl sulfoxide in PBS) was intraperitoneally injected at 0, 24, and 48 hours post ischemia (B and
C; n=7–8). Infarct volumes were determined at 72 hours post
ischemia using cresyl violet staining (A–C). MCAO indicates
middle cerebral artery occlusion. *P<0.05, ***P<0.001.

Neuroprotective Effect of CXCR2 Antagonization Is
Abrogated in Neutrophil-Depleted Hyperlipidemic
ApoE−/− Mice
To test whether neuroprotective effects in hyperlipidemic
mice were attributed to specific effects on neutrophils, we
assessed infarct volume in ischemic mice, which had been
neutrophil-depleted using a specific anti-Ly6G (1A8) antibody11 and in which CXCR2 was inhibited with SB225002
(Figure 2B). Neutrophil depletion led to a significant reduction of infarct volume in hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice but
not in normolipidemic wild-type mice (Figure 2C). Of
note, administration of the CXCR2 antagonist did not further reduce infarct volume in neutrophil-depleted mice
(Figure 2C), indicating that neuroprotection by SB225002
can be assigned to a direct effect on CXCR2-expressing
neutrophils.

To analyze whether brain neutrophil invasion was blocked by
pharmacological CXCR2 antagonization, we quantified cerebral neutrophils infiltrated in ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres by flow cytometry. The CXCR2 antagonist SB225002
decreased neutrophil counts in ischemic hemispheres of
ApoE−/− mice on Western diet and wild-type mice on normal
diet (Figure 3A). Recruitment of other immune cell subsets
was not significantly modulated by CXCR2 inhibition (Figure
II in the online-only Data Supplement), suggesting a selective
interaction with neutrophils. To exclude potential confounders
related to differences in lesion size, we quantified the regional
densities of neutrophils within the lesion rim by Ly6G immunohistochemistry and furthermore evaluated their localization
with respect to brain capillaries in costainings with the panendothelial marker CD31. Although previous studies had shown
a predominant association of neutrophils with ischemic brain
vessels,18 we observed a significant proportion of neutrophils in
the brain parenchyma for all investigated groups (Figure 3B),
closely in line with recent reports of others and us.11,19 The local
distribution of neutrophils was not significantly modulated by
hyperlipidemia or by administration of the CXCR2 antagonist
SB225002 (Figure 3B, top middle). Distances of intraparenchymal neutrophils to the most adjacent vessel were also not
changed (Figure 3B, top right). Therefore, we quantified the
total number of neutrophils (vessel-associated and intraparenchymal) revealing significantly reduced numbers of neutrophils
in the injured brain of ischemic hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice
treated with SB225002 compared with vehicle-treated mice and
ischemic normolipidemic wild-type mice (Figure 3B, bottom).
To avoid false interpretation because of unspecific effects of
SB225002 on blood–brain barrier characteristics, which might
have contributed to inhibition of neutrophil infiltration and tissue injury, we also performed a detailed analysis of blood–brain
barrier integrity and endothelial activation. Except an increased
blood–brain barrier permeability (Figure IIIA in the online-only
Data Supplement) and increased intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular adhesion molecule-1 expression (Figure 3C
and 3D) in ischemic hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice compared
with normolipidemic wild-type mice, no significant changes
were induced by systemic SB225002 administration. The overall number of vessels was affected neither by hyperlipidemia nor
by CXCR2 antagonization (Figure IIIB in the online-only Data
Supplement). Therefore, reduced neutrophil infiltration might be
directly attributed to the CXCR2-inhibitory effect of SB225002.

Peripheral Neutrophilia in Ischemic Hyperlipidemic
ApoE−/− Mice Is Reduced by CXCR2 Antagonization
In addition to chemotactic activity, we examined whether modulation of CXCR2 changes the number of peripheral neutrophils.
Analysis of the absolute viable neutrophil counts demonstrated
that focal cerebral ischemia induced an increase in circulating
and bone marrow neutrophils in hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice,
which was inhibited by SB225002 (Figure 4). These data suggest that neutrophil homeostasis is altered in the bone marrow,

Figure 3. CXCR2 antagonization reduces neutrophil infiltration without affecting endothelial activation. Wild-type mice fed a normal chow (normolipidemic) or ApoE−/− mice fed a Western diet for 6 weeks (hyperlipidemic) were exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by
intraperitoneal administration of the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 (2 mg/kg) or vehicle (1% dimethyl sulfoxide in PBS) at 0, 24, and 48 hours post
stroke. Analysis was performed at 72 hours post ischemia. The amount of brain infiltrated neutrophils was quantified in ipsilateral and contralateral
hemispheres using flow cytometry by gating of PI−, CD45high, SSChigh, and Ly6G+ cells (A, 3 individual experiments, 3–4 brains pooled per group and
experiment). Local neutrophil accumulation and distribution were assessed via immunohistochemical stainings for Ly6G on ischemic brain tissue
sections at the level of bregma (B, n=6). The exact localization of neutrophils was determined through Ly6G/CD31 costainings that were evaluated
by confocal microscopy (B, top left). Distances between single neutrophils (Ly6G, green) to the most adjacent vessel (CD31, red) were measured to
differentiate between intravascular (0 µm, arrow), perivascular (0–10 µm, arrowhead), and intraparenchymal (>10 µm, asterisk) neutrophils. The percentage of neutrophils within the indicated regions was calculated (B, top middle), and distances for intraparenchymal cells were measured (B, top
right). Finally, the total amount of neutrophils was quantified (B, bottom). ICAM-1 (C) and VCAM-1 (D) stainings combined with stainings for the
pan-endothelial cell marker CD31 were performed on ischemic brain tissue sections. Positive ICAM-1, CD31, and VCAM-1 vessels were counted,
and the percentage of ICAM-1 (C) and VCAM-1 (D) positive vessels was calculated (n=6). Scale bars: 50 µm (A, C, and D, bottom) and
25 µm (A, top). ICAM-1 indicates intracellular adhesion molecule-1; and VCAM-1, vascular adhesion molecule-1. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.

survival by quantifying the proportion of dead neutrophils by
flow cytometry using propidium iodide. On CXCR2 antagonization, ischemic hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice revealed an
increased proportion of dead neutrophils in the bone marrow (Figure 5A), suggesting that SB225002 counteracts the
ischemia-induced increase of neutrophil survival in hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice. In normolipidemic wild-type mice,
on the other hand, neither ischemia nor CXCR2 deactivation
modulated the proportion of dead neutrophils (Figure 5A).
To exclude any confounding effects by false-positive detection rarely associated with propidium iodide staining, we
quantified the proportion of Annexin V positive bone marrow
neutrophils in ischemic hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice either
treated with vehicle or with the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002.
Confirming propidium iodide measurements, increased numbers of apoptotic cells were noted in SB225002-treated mice
(Figure 5B).
Next, we wondered whether CXCR2 expression on neutrophils was affected by hyperlipidemia or ischemia. Flow
cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed
that CXCR2 protein and mRNA expression on bone marrow
neutrophils were increased on ischemia in hyperlipidemic
ApoE−/− mice, which were reversed through CXCR2 deactivation by SB225002 (Figure 5C and 5D). In normolipidemic
wild-type mice, neither ischemia nor CXCR2 antagonization affected CXCR2 expression on bone marrow neutrophils
(Figure 5C and 5D).
Figure 4. Stroke-induced peripheral neutrophilia in hyperlipidemic mice is decreased by CXCR2 antagonization. White blood
cells isolated from blood and bone marrow cells isolated from
left and right femurs and tibiae were analyzed by flow cytometry
after erythrocyte lysis. Absolute neutrophil counts were determined by quantification of PI−, CD45+, Ly6G+, SSChigh cells in
isolated blood (A) and bone marrow (B) cells of normolipidemic
wild-type mice and hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice that were either
sham operated or exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by intraperitoneal administration of the
CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 (2 mg/kg) or vehicle (1% dimethyl
sulfoxide in PBS) at 0, 24, and 48 hours post stroke (n=9–12).

in addition to peripheral blood. Of note, neither focal cerebral
ischemia nor CXCR2 antagonization by SB225002 influenced
the number of blood and bone marrow neutrophils in normolipidemic wild-type mice (Figure 4). In addition to an ischemiaindependent overall increase in myeloid cells in the blood and
reduced lymphocyte numbers in the bone marrow of hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice, we observed an ischemia-induced reduction
in lymphocyte subsets in all experimental groups (Figure IV
in the online-only Data Supplement). However, none of these
immune cell subsets were regulated by the CXCR2 inhibitor,
suggesting a selective interaction with neutrophils (Figure IV in
the online-only Data Supplement).

CXCR2 Antagonist SB225002 Modulates Oxidative
Stress–Related Enzyme Expression in Bone Marrow
Neutrophils and Reduces Oxidative Damage in
Ischemic Brains of Hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− Mice
To further elucidate mechanisms for the differential effects
of CXCR2 inhibition in normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic
mice, we finally investigated whether oxidative stress–related
enzyme expression was modulated by hyperlipidemia, ischemia, and CXCR2 antagonization. mRNA expression analysis
of the inflammation-associated inducible nitric oxide synthase
in sorted bone marrow neutrophils demonstrated that focal
cerebral ischemia induces a strong increase in hyperlipidemic
ApoE−/− but not in normolipidemic wild-type mice, which
was reversed by CXCR2 blockade (Figure 6A). Moreover, a
significant ischemia-induced decrease of NADPH oxidase 2
expression detected in normolipidemic wild-type mice was
absent in hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice. However, CXCR2
deactivation by SB225002 reduced NADPH oxidase 2 expression in ischemic hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice to levels of ischemic normolipidemic wild-type mice (Figure 6B). We further
observed an overall reduced expression of the antioxidative
enzymes, catalase and superoxide dismutase 2, in ischemic
and nonischemic hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice, which was
not influenced by CXCR2 inhibition (Figure V in the onlineonly Data Supplement). Taken together, these data suggest
that hyperlipidemia combined with focal cerebral ischemia
promotes an inflammatory and reactive oxygen species producing phenotype in ischemic hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice,
which is partially counterbalanced by CXCR2 deactivation.
In light of the presented results, we further analyzed oxidative

Figure 5. The CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 increases peripheral neutrophil apoptosis and reduces CXCR2 expression in ischemic hyperlipidemic mice. Dead neutrophils were determined by quantification of propidium iodide (PI) positive cells of CD45+, Ly6G+, and SSChigh
cells via flow cytometry of isolated bone marrow cells in wild-type mice on normal diet or ApoE−/− mice on Western diet for 6 weeks that
were either sham operated or exposed to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; A, n=9–12). Administration of the CXCR2 antagonist
SB225002 (2 mg/kg) or vehicle (1% dimethyl sulfoxide in PBS) was performed at 0, 24, and 48 hours post stroke. To verify analysis of PI
stainings, additional stainings for Annexin V positive neutrophils in the bone marrow of ischemic hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice comparing
effects of vehicle and the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 were performed (B, n=6). Representative histograms revealing Annexin V staining intensities of CD45+, Ly6G+ and SSClow cells (left) and quantification of the proportion of apoptotic neutrophils are shown (B). CXCR2
expression was quantified on bone marrow neutrophils via flow cytometry analyzing mean fluorescence intensity (MFI; C, n=9–12) and by
gene expression analysis of CXCR2 via real-time polymerase chain reaction on magnetic activated cell sorting–sorted bone marrow neutrophils (D, n=4–6). Mean values of ∆∆ct values (relative expression) are presented in D. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.

8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) as an indicator of
oxidative stress. Quantification of 8-oxo-dG positive cells
in ischemic brain tissue revealed that the CXCR2 antagonist
SB225002 reduced increased levels of oxidative DNA damage in hyperlipidemic ApoE−/− mice, whereas normolipidemic
wild-type mice exhibited an overall low density of 8-oxo-dG
positive cells, which was not modulated by the CXCR2 antagonist (Figure 6C).

Discussion
Systemic inflammation is linked to stroke occurrence and
severity. However, translation from bench-to-bedside targeting
the immune system to prevent stroke or diminish damage has
failed to date. One critical issue regarding the lack of successful translation is that underlying inflammation associated with
comorbidity factors, such as hyperlipidemia, has been broadly
neglected in most preclinical trials. We have previously shown
that increased ischemic brain damage in hyperlipidemic mice
coincides with increased cerebral and peripheral granulocyte

numbers.4 In this study, we provide the causal link between
these observations by showing that pharmacological or antiserum-mediated antagonization of the neutrophil-specific
chemokine receptor CXCR2 or anti-Ly6G antibody-induced
neutrophil depletion restores functional outcome and reverses
brain injury induced by hyperlipidemia, thereby unraveling
the functional significance of neutrophils in the pathogenesis
of ischemic brain injury. Interestingly, only hyperlipidemic
mice were responsive to CXCR2 antagonization, cerebral
neutrophil infiltration being strongly attenuated by CXCR2
inhibition in hyperlipidemic mice. This increased chemotactic
activity of neutrophils in ischemic hyperlipidemic mice was
most likely evoked by the increased CXCR2 expression on
peripheral neutrophils, perhaps combined with the previously
reported increase of its ligands CXCL1 and CXCL2 in ischemic brains of hyperlipidemic mice.4 Chemotactic receptors,
such as CXCR2, are involved in interactions with endothelial
cells and platelets, which play an important role in atherosclerosis development20 and which regulate neutrophil crawling in
inflamed vessels.21 Thus, brain platelet–neutrophil interactions

Figure 6. Expression of oxidative stress–related enzymes in bone marrow neutrophils and cerebral oxidative DNA damage of ischemic
hyperlipidemic mice are modulated by CXCR2 antagonization. mRNA expression analysis of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; A) and
NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2; B) was analyzed in magnetic activated cell sorting–sorted Ly6G+ bone marrow neutrophils at 72 hours post
ischemia of wild-type mice fed a normal chow or ApoE−/− mice fed a Western diet for 6 weeks that were either sham operated or exposed
to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by intraperitoneal administration of the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 (2 mg/kg) or
vehicle (1% dimethyl sulfoxide in PBS) at 0, 24, and 48 hours post stroke. Mean values of ∆∆ct values are presented (relative expression,
n=4–6). C, Oxidative DNA damage was analyzed by immunohistochemical detection and quantification of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine
(8-oxo-dG) positive cells in ischemic brain tissue (n=4–6). Scale bar: 50 µm. **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.

might be associated with the initiation of neutrophil infiltration into the ischemic brain in hyperlipidemia.
In addition to enhanced chemoattraction to the brain,
elevated cerebral neutrophil counts in hyperlipidemic stroke
mice might partially result from the overall increased number
of circulating neutrophils induced by ischemia. Importantly,
CXCR2 antagonization by SB225002 reversed this peripheral
neutrophilia. Because increased circulating neutrophils were
paralleled by increased bone marrow neutrophils, elevation of
blood neutrophils caused by a CXCR2-dependent release from
the bone marrow to the circulation14 seems unlikely. Instead,
stroke-induced survival of bone marrow neutrophils in hyperlipidemia was blocked by CXCR2 antagonization. Indeed,
neutrophil viability has been shown to be regulated by chemokines in interaction with CXCR2.22 Furthermore, CXCR2
antagonization increases neutrophil apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner,23 supporting our concept of induction
of neutrophil apoptosis by the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002.
The lack of apoptosis induction in sham-operated and ischemic
normolipidemic mice might be explained by the lower CXCR2
expression. Thus, a certain chemokine receptor expression and
activation level seems to be required for neutrophil survival.

Although CXCR2 blockade resulted in reduced cerebral
neutrophil entry both in normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic
mice, only hyperlipidemic mice benefited from CXCR2 inhibition, suggesting that in addition to the total number, the
phenotype of neutrophils determines the impact on stroke outcome. We show that focal cerebral ischemia induces a strong
increase of inducible nitric oxide synthase and NADPH oxidase 2 in neutrophils of hyperlipidemic mice, which is downregulated by CXCR2 inhibition. Both enzymes are involved in
the generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, one of the
main effector functions of neutrophils in stroke pathology.24,25
Alterations of the neutrophil phenotype in ischemic hyperlipidemic mice were associated with an increased level of cerebral oxidative DNA damage, which was similarly reversed by
CXCR2 deactivation as inducible nitric oxide synthase. These
associated findings may indicate that decreased neutrophil
activation and reactive oxygen species production through
CXCR2 antagonization might present a potential mechanism
underlying the observed neuroprotective effects in hyperlipidemic ischemic mice. This is further supported by a previous
study reporting reduced myeloperoxidase activity of neutrophils after CXCR2 antagonization.23 In light of previous

studies suggesting a certain neutrophil plasticity similar to
macrophage plasticity distinguishing proinflammatory M1
and anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages,19,26 increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, a classical M1 marker,
imply that the combination of brain ischemia and hyperlipidemia might induce a general switch of neutrophils to a proinflammatory N1 phenotype, which is reversed by CXCR2
antagonization. Additional studies will be required to characterize the whole repertoire of classical M1/N1 and M2/N2
markers in this specific experimental setting.
Despite reduced cerebral neutrophil infiltration, normolipidemic mice were not protected by CXCR2 inhibition. This
observation appears to differ from recent studies, including our
own, demonstrating neuroprotection by neutrophil depletion
and blocking neutrophil invasion.9–12 The most likely explanation is the different severity of brain injury. Although the latter
studies induced 45- and 60-minute MCAO, we used a mild
ischemia model leading to much smaller infarcts and a lesser
degree of neutrophil accumulation, suggesting that a certain
threshold of cerebral neutrophil counts needs to be exceeded
to uncover the cells’ pathogenic role. However, even if more
severe injury models are used, several studies interfering with
CXCR2 signaling and thereby reducing neutrophil infiltration
failed to influence stroke outcome in normolipidemic wildtype mice.27–29 But most of these studies assessed stroke outcome at 24 hours post injury that might be too early to detect
secondary neurodegeneration after the complex inflammatory
cascade have been fully established. Although neutrophils
are considered to be the first invaders of the ischemic brain,
secondary recruitment of neutrophils through interleukin-17
producing γδ T cells peaking at 3 days post injury has been
suggested.30 Therefore, it cannot be excluded to detect protection in a more severe stroke model at 3 to 7 days post ischemia. In fact, administration of neutralizing CXCR2 serum in
a severe transient MCAO model in normolipidemic wild-type
mice results in significantly smaller infarct sizes 3 days after
stroke.30 However, Cuartero et al19 demonstrated that neutrophil infiltration is maximal after 24 hours and that modification of neutrophil phenotype by rosiglitazone is associated
with significantly reduced infarct volumes in normolipidemic
mice at 24 hours post ischemia, indicating that 72 hours might
have been too late to detect the impact of CXCR2 inhibition
in normolipidemia. In our study, infarct volume in normolipidemic mice was unaffected by CXCR2 antagonization at 24
and 72 hours post stroke, demonstrating that the observations
made did not depend on the selection of the time window.
Nevertheless, specific characteristics of ischemia models (eg,
distal versus intraluminal) should carefully be considered,
when evaluating observations in earlier studies.31
In conclusion, our study suggests that the contribution
of neutrophils to the development of ischemic brain injury
depends on the pathophysiological state. Thus, neutrophils
have a unique role in stroke pathogenesis in hyperlipidemia.
Similarly, differential roles of immune cell subsets have previously been shown for CCR2+ monocytes which are important for vascular stabilization in normolipidemic ischemic
mice32 but harmful in acute hyperlipidemia.5 By showing that
hyperlipidemic mice—unlike normolipidemic mice—respond

to the inhibition of the neutrophil-specific chemokine receptor CXCR2, we provide a potential therapeutic strategy for
attenuating the exacerbation of ischemic injury induced by
hyperlipidemia. In the evaluation of new therapies, preclinical
and clinical studies should carefully consider inflammationassociated comorbidities, namely hyperlipidemia, which, as
we show, may alter the responsiveness of the ischemic brain
tissue.

Supplemental Methods
Induction of focal cerebral ischemia
Animals were anesthetized with 1% isoflurane (30% O2, remainder N2O). Rectal temperature
was maintained between 36.5 and 37.0°C using a feedback-controlled heating system.
Cerebral blood flow was analyzed by laser Doppler flow (LDF) recordings and was monitored
during ischemia for up to 10 min after reperfusion onset. For induction of cerebral ischemia, a
midline neck incision was made; the left common carotid artery (CCA) and the external
carotid artery were isolated and ligated. A nylon monofilament coated with silicon resin was
introduced through a small incision into the CCA and advanced to the carotid bifurcation for
induction of MCAO. Twenty minutes later, reperfusion was initiated by monofilament
removal. In sham-operated animals, all procedures were performed exactly as for MCAO
except for occlusion of the MCA. As such, the left CCA and the external carotid artery were
isolated and ligated and a small incision was made in the CCA followed by immediate
ligation without introducing a filament. After the surgery, wounds were carefully sutured,
anesthesia was discontinued and animals were placed back into their cages.
Animal allocation and exclusion criteria for tMCAO experiments
A total of 352 male mice were enrolled into the study. In the first set of studies, 24 C57Bl/6J
mice fed a normal chow and 24 ApoE-/- mice fed a western diet for 6 weeks underwent
MCAO and were randomly assigned to 2 groups for each phenotype treated with the selective
CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 (n=12/group) or vehicle (n=12/group). These mice were used
for behavioral testing at 4, 7 and 14 days post-ischemia (dpi). A second cohort of mice
(wildtype normolipidemic: n=34, ApoE-/- hyperlipidemic: n=18) that underwent MCAO and
that were either treated with SB225002 (n=8-9/group) or vehicle (n=8-9/group) was used for
immunohistochemical analysis at 24 or 72 hours post-ischemia. A third set of mice (n=108)
was used to determine infarct volumes of ischemic normolipidemic wildtype and
hyperlipidemic ApoE-/- mice that were treated with normal rabbit serum (NRS) (n=9/group) or
anti-CXCR2 (n=9/group) or anti-Ly6G + vehicle (n=9/group) or isotype + vehicle
(n=9/group) or anti-Ly6G + CXCR2 antagonist (n=9/group) or isotype + CXCR2 antagonist
(n=9/group). A fourth set of mice (n=96) was generated for analysis of leukocyte subsets in
the blood, the brain and the bone marrow at 3 dpi. These mice were assigned to 8
experimental groups by balanced randomization: wildtype normolipidemic / sham / vehicle
(n=12), wildtype normolipidemic / MCAO / vehicle (n=12), wildtype normolipidemic / sham
/ CXCR2 antagonist (n=12), wildtype normolipidemic / MCAO / CXCR2 antagonist (n=12),
ApoE-/- hyperlipidemic / sham / vehicle (n=12), ApoE-/- hyperlipidemic / MCAO / vehicle
(n=12), ApoE-/- hyperlipidemic / sham / CXCR2 antagonist (n=12) and ApoE-/- hyperlipidemic
/ MCAO / CXCR2 antagonist(n=12). The same group assignment was used for the fifth set of
mice to determine mRNA expression in MACS-sorted bone marrow neutrophils at 3 dpi
(n=6/group).
Exclusion criteria were defined as follows: prolonged operation time > 15 min; no reperfusion
after filament withdrawal; insufficient drop of blood flow (<70%); death within 72 hours after
MCAO. Altogether, 28 mice (10.0%) met at least one of these criteria and had to be excluded
from the study. Drop-out rates were not affected by SB225002, anti-Ly6G and anti-CXCR2treatment albeit hyperlipidemicmice reveal slightly increased mortality rates (wildtype
normolipidemic n=10, ApoE-/- hyperlipidemic n= 14).
Assessment of functional outcome
Before actual test performance at the time points given, mice were trained 1-2 days before
induction of stroke. Both rota rod and tight rope test were performed twice per test point and
means were calculated. As for the rota rod test, mice were put on an accelerating drum with a
velocity range of 4-40 rpm. Maximal testing time was 300 s and the time until the animal fell

off was recorded and used for statistical analysis. Regarding the tight rope test, the animal was
placed in the middle of 60 cm long rope with its forepaws. The rope itself was spun between
two platforms with whole apparatus about 50 cm above the ground. Maximal testing time was
60 s and both whether or not the animal reached the platform and the time needed to achieve
the latter was used applying a validated score from 0 (min) to 20 (max).
Determination of infarct volumes
Infarct volumes were analyzed on cresyl violet stained sections at a distance of 400 µm within
the range of +2 mm up to -4.4 mm from bregma. Sections were scanned and analyzed using
ImageJ (NIH, USA). Infarct volumes were determined by application of the indirect infarct
measurement as previously described1. As such, the non-lesioned volume of the ipsilateral
hemisphere was subtracted from the total volume of the contralateral side.
Immunohistochemistry
Cellular degeneration was analyzed via staining of DNA fragmentation using terminal
transferasedUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) according to the manufactures’ protocol (In situ
Cell Death Detection Kit, Roche, Switzerland). For the remaining conventional
immunohistochemistries, the following primary antibodies were used: biotinylated goat antimouse IgG (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotech, USA), biotinylated goat anti-mouse ICAM-1 (1:50,
R&D Systems, USA), rat anti-mouse CD31 (1:500, BD Biosciences, Germany), goat antimouse VCAM-1 (1:100, R&D Systems), rat anti-mouse Ly6G (1:200, BD Biosciences). For
co-stainings of Ly6G and CD31 a biotinylated rat-anti-mouse CD31 antibody was used
(1:100, Biolegend, USA). For endothelial markers and evaluation of neutrophil infiltration
and localization, slides were fixed with methanol/acetone followed by incubation with
primary antibodies. Oxidative DNA damage was detected through staining of 8-hydroxy-2’deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG, 1:100, Trevigen, USA) according to the manufactures’
instructions. As secondary antibodies, Cy3-conjugated anti-rat (1:100, Jackson Lab., UK)
antibody, streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000, Invitrogen, Germany) and Alexa Fluor 488
conjugated anti-goat antibody (1:500, Invitrogen, Germany) were used for CD31/ICAM-1 and
CD31/VCAM-1 co-stainings, respectively. Primary antibody binding of Ly6G/CD31 costainings were detected with a goat anti rat Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Invitrogen, Germany) and
streptavidin Alexa Fluor 594 (1:1000, Invitrogen, Germany), respectively. 8-oxo-dG was
revealed by incubation with an anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 as secondary antibody. For
detection of extravasated IgG, slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) followed
by incubation with the primary antibody overnight. Antibody binding was visualized using the
Vectastain®AB kit (Vector Laboratories, USA) according to the manufactures’ protocol.
Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in 70% methanol in Trisbuffered saline (TBS) prior to the staining.
Sections were evaluated under a bright light and fluorescence microscope (Axioplan; Zeiss,
Germany) connected to a CCD camera (Microfire; AVT Horn, Germany) for quantification of
cellular degeneration, endothelial activation, IgG extravasation and neutrophil accumulation.
Cellular injury was analyzed by counting TUNEL+ cells in 6 different regions of interest
(ROI, each 62.500 µm²) and mean values were calculated for individual animals. Confocal
imaging (A1plus, Eclipse Ti, with NIS Elements AR software, Nikon, Germany) was used to
generate large scale images of complete hemispheres on TUNEL-stained sections for
representative image presentation (Fig. 1D). Using a 10x objective z-stacks of 30 µm
thickness (2 µm focal plane distance) were acquired in 7 x 6 overlapping regions (15%
overlap) covering the whole hemisphere. Maximal intensity projections were used for
graphical presentation using the NIS Elements AR software. IgG extravasation was evaluated
on photographs derived from 6 defined ROIs (each 125.000 µm²; 3 ROI striatum, 3 ROI
cortex) that were converted into gray scale. Mean optical densities were measured using
Image J software (NIH, USA). For analysis of CD31/ICAM-1 and CD31/VCAM-1 co-

stainings, positively stained CD31 vessels and ICAM-1 or VCAM-1 vessels were counted on
the same photographs of 3 defined ROIs (125.00 µm² each) followed by calculation of percent
values for ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 positive vessels of all CD31 positive vessels. Neutrophil
infiltration was quantified by counting Ly6G+ cells in 8 regions of interest (each 25.000 µm2)
within 2-3 sections per animal. For quantification of neutrophil-vessel-distances confocal
analysis was performed as previously described2. A total of 502 cells (wildtype
normolipidemic / MCAO / vehicle (n=109), wildtype normolipidemic / MCAO / CXCR2
antagonist (n=65), ApoE-/- hyperlipidemic / MCAO / vehicle (n=217), ApoE-/- hyperlipidemic
/ MCAO / CXCR2 antagonist (n=111)) were analyzed. Histological analysis was performed
while being blinded to the experimental groups.
Cell separation and flow cytometry
Animals were euthanized by i.p. injections of chloralhydrate (200 mg/kg body weight). Blood
was taken from the vena cava and collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) coated
collection tubes followed by transcardial perfusion with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline
(PBS). Flushed bone marrow from right and left femur and tibias were pooled and
mechanically dissociated through a 70 µm cell strainer. For both, bone marrow and blood,
erythrocytes were lysed by incubation with 155 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, 3 mM EDTA
for 5 min followed by two washing steps with PBS. Brains were dissected and hemispheres
divided into ipsilesional and contralesional parts. For each measurement, three to four
hemispheres were pooled and homogenized through a 70 µm cell strainer (BD Biosciences)
by continuous rinsing with 50 ml cold HEPES-buffered RPMI1640. Samples were
centrifuged at 286 g for 5 min at 18°C. The supernatants were discarded and the pellets were
resuspended in 15 ml of 37% Percoll in 0.01 M HCl/ PBS and centrifuged at 2800 g for 20
min. Myelin was removed and the remaining cell pellet was washed twice in PBS.
For multichannel flow cytometry isolated cell suspensions of the different organs were
incubated with the blocking antibody rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (FC fragment) for 15 min at
+4°C followed by incubation with the antibody cocktails listed in Supplemental Table I for
further 30 min. Two panels of antibodies were used (Supplemental Table I): panel 1 enabled
counting of myeloid-derived leukocytes and panel 2 divided lymphocyte subsets. For analysis
of myeloid cells, CD45high cells were gated by propidium iodide and lymphocyte lineage
markers (B220, CD3, NK1.1) to exclude contamination with dead cells and lymphoid subsets,
which can partially express myeloid markers. Viable and lymphoid-depleted cells were
subdivided by scatter characteristics and Ly6G expression to identify neutrophils.
Macrophages/monocytes were defined by CD11b expression in the SSC low Ly6G- cell
population and macrophage/monocyte subsets were identified according to their Ly6C
expression. Dendritic cells were identified by CD11c expression. For analysis of lymphoid
cells, CD45high cells were gated for viable lymphoid cells according to scatter characteristics
and propidium iodide. B lymphocyte, NK cells and T lymphocyte subsets were defined by
CD19, NK1.1, CD4 and CD8 antigen characteristics, respectively. For analysis of neutrophil
apoptosis, CD45+, Ly6G+ cells were gated by propidium iodide in isolated blood and bone
marrow cell suspensions. To confirm propidium iodide analysis a part of bone marrow
samples (hyperlipidemic / MCAO / vehicle and hypelipidemic / MCAO / CXCR2 antagonist,
n=6/group) was used for stainings of the apoptosis marker AnnexinV (BD Biosciences,
Germany) according to the manufactures’ protocol. Cells were analyzed using an LSR II and
FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences, Germany). Absolute cell numbers for blood and CNS
were analyzed by the use of BD TrueCount beads (BD Biosciences, Germany) according to
the protocol on the basis of CD45 positive events. Bone marrow cell counts were determined
by trypan blue exclusion and a haemocytometer.
Real time PCR

Total RNA was isolated from MACS-sorted neutrophils using an RNA purification kit
(Promega) according to the manufactures recommendations. First-strand cDNA was
synthesized using 500 ng of total RNA and TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied
Biosystems). The PCR amplification was performed in 96-well optical reaction plates for 40
cycles with each cycle at 94°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min using FAST SYBR® Green
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The PCR was conducted on the StepOne Real-Time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems). CT values were normalized for the housekeeping gene ß-actin
[ΔCT=CT (target gene) - CT (ß-actin)] and related to the mean of control samples (wildtype /
sham / vehicle) using the ΔΔCT formula [ΔΔCT= ΔCT (sample) – ΔCT (control)]. Primer
sequences are given in Supplemental Table 2.

Supplemental Figures

Supplemental Figure I: The CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 does not provide
neuroprotection in normolipidemic wildtype mice 24 hours after mild focal cerebral
ischemia. Wildtype mice fed with a normal chow were exposed to 20 minutes MCAO
followed by i.p. administration of the CXCR2 antatgonist SB225002 (2 mg/kg) or vehicle
(1% DMSO in PBS) during reperfusion. At 24 hours post-ischemia infarct volume was
determined using cresyl violet staining.

Supplemental Figure II: CXCR2 antagonization does not modulate cerebral infiltration
of macrophages/monocytes, dendritic cells and lymphocyte subsets. Wildtype mice fed a
normal chow (normolipidemic) or ApoE-/- mice fed a Western diet for 6 weeks
(hyperlipidemic) were exposed to MCAO followed by i.p. administration of the CXCR2
antagonist SB225002 (2 mg/kg) or vehicle (1% DMSO in PBS) at 0 hours, 24 hours and 48
hours post stroke. Analysis was performed at 72 hours post-ischemia. The amount of brain
infiltrated macrophages/monocytes (A), dendritic cells (B) and lymphocyte subsets (C) was
quantified in ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres using flow cytometry by gating for PI-,
CD45high, SSClow, Ly6G-, CD11b+ cells in (A); for PI-, CD45high, SSClow, Ly6G-, CD11c+ cells
in (B) and for PI-, CD45high, SSClow, NK1.1+ (NK cells), CD19+ (B cells), CD 4+ (CD4 T
cells) and CD8+ (CD8 T cells) in (C). CD11b+ cells were further divided into Ly6C negative
(resident) and Ly6C positive (inflammatory) macrophage/monocyte subsets (A). Data are
derived from 3 individual experiments with 3-4 hemispheres pooled per group and
experiment. *p < 0.05 for Ly6C neg, § p < 0.05 for Ly6C pos.

Supplemental Figure III: Blood brain barrier integrity and vessel densities are not
altered by CXCR2 antagonization. The CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 (2 mg/kg) or vehicle
(1% DMSO in PBS) were i.p. injected at 0 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours post-ischemia in
wildtype mice fed with normal chow (normolipidemic) or ApoE-/- mice fed a high cholesterol
diet (hyperlipidemic). Blood brain barrier integrity (A) and vessel density (B) were analyzed
by immunohistochemical stainings of extravasated mouse IgG and CD31 on tissue sections of
ischemic brains of the indicated groups (n=6/group). * p<0.05, ** p<0.01.

Supplemental Figure IV: The CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 does not influence bone
marrow and blood derived macrophage/monocyte, dendritic cell and lymphocyte
populations. White blood cells isolated from whole blood and bone marrow cells isolated
from left and right femurs and tibiae of wildtype mice fed a normal chow (normolipidemic) or

ApoE-/- mice fed a Western diet for 6 weeks (hyperlipidemic) that were either sham operated
or exposed to MCAO followed by i.p. administration of the CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 (2
mg/kg) or vehicle (1% DMSO in PBS) at 0 hours, 24hours and 48 hours post stroke were
analyzed by flow cytometry (n=6-12). Absolute macrophage/monocyte (A,B), dendritic (C;D)
and lymphocyte (E,F) counts were determined by quantification of PI-, CD45+, SSClow, Ly6G, CD11b+ (A,B); PI-, CD45+, SSClow, Ly6G-, CD11c+ (C,D) and PI-, CD45+, SSClow, NK1.1
(NK cells), CD19 (B cells), CD 4 (CD4 T cells) and CD8 (CD8 T cells) (E,F),
respectively.CD11b+ cells were further divided into Ly6C negative (resident) and Ly6C
positive (inflammatory) macrophage/monocyte subsets. ***p<0.001 for total
macrophages/monocytes in (A), ***p<0.002 for dendritic cells in (D), **p<0.01and
***p<0.001 for B cells in (E,F), §p<0.05 and §§p<0.01 for CD8 T cells in (E,F), ## p<0.01 for
CD4 T cells in (E).

Supplemental Figure V: Expression of anti-oxidative enzymes in bone marrow
neutrophils is not modulated by CXCR2 antagonization. mRNA expression analysis of
superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) (A) and catalase (CAT) (B) was analyzed in (MACS)-sorted
Ly6G+ bone marrow neutrophils at 72 hours post ischemia of wildtype mice fed a normal
chow (normolipidemic) or ApoE-/- mice fed a Western diet for 6 weeks (hyperlipidemic) that
were either sham operated or exposed to MCAO followed by i.p. administration of the
CXCR2 antagonist SB225002 (2 mg/kg) or vehicle (1% DMSO in PBS) at 0 hours, 24 hours
and 48 hours post stroke (n=4-6). Mean values of 2-∆∆ct values are presented (relative
expression). **p<0.01; ***p<0.001.
