Abstract
Vinexin-b is an adaptor protein that regulates cell adhesion,
cytoskeletal organization and signal transduction. Our previous work showed that Vinexin-b protects against cardiac
hypertrophy. However, its function in stroke is largely
unknown. In the present study, we observed a signiﬁcant
increase in Vinexin-b expression in both human intracerebral
haemorrhage and mouse cerebral ischaemia/reperfusion (I/
R) injury model, indicating that Vinexin-b is involved in stroke.
Next, using Vinexin-b knockout mice, we further demonstrated
that Vinexin-b deﬁciency signiﬁcantly protected against cerebral I/R injury, as demonstrated by a dramatic decrease in the
infarct volume and an improvement in neurological function.
Additionally, immunoﬂuorescence and western blotting

showed that the deletion of Vinexin-b attenuated neuronal
apoptosis. Mechanically, we found that Akt signalling was upregulated in the brains of the Vinexin-b knockout mice
compared with those of the WT control mice after ischaemic
injury. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the
deletion of Vinexin-b potently protects against ischaemic injury
by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis, and this effect may occur via
the up-regulation of Akt signalling. Our ﬁndings revealed that
Vinexin-b acts as a novel modulator of ischaemic injury,
suggesting that Vinexin-b may represent an attractive therapeutic target for the prevention of stroke.

Stroke is the leading cause of death and permanent disability
in industrialized countries (Murray and Lopez 1997; Donnan
et al. 2008). Sudden occlusion of a blood vessel by a
thrombus or an embolism mostly contributes to stroke, which
leads to an almost immediate absence of the supply of
substrates, particularly oxygen and glucose, to the cerebral
tissue (Dirnagl et al. 1999). The pathological processes of
stroke are complex, which involves in oxidative stress,
cellular bioenergetic failure, inﬂammation, neuronal apoptosis and blood–brain barrier dysfunction (Doyle et al. 2008).
Although the processes mediating ischaemic brain injury are
multifactorial, increasing experimental evidence suggests
that neuronal apoptosis plays a critical role in stroke
(Kakizawa et al. 2012; Hernandez-Jimenez et al. 2013).
Thus, targeting and preventing apoptosis appear to be a
rational therapeutic strategy for the improvement of stroke
outcome.

Vinexin is an adaptor protein that is localized to focal
adhesions and cell–cell junctions (Kioka et al. 2002).
Vinexin was originally isolated as a vinculin-binding protein
by yeast two-hybrid screening (Kioka et al. 1999). Vinexin

is transcribed as two isoforms, Vinexin-a and -b. In contrast
to Vinexin-a, Vinexin-b is expressed ubiquitously, although
at particularly high levels in the heart (Kioka et al. 2002).
Vinexin-b contains three SH3 domains in its C-terminal
sequence, through which Vinexin-b binds to vinculin and
Sos (Akamatsu et al. 1999). Vinexin-b is most known to
modulate cell adhesion, cell spreading, cytoskeletal organization and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation (Akamatsu
et al. 1999; Kioka et al. 1999, 2002). Recently, we found
that the deletion of Vinexin-b in mice promoted cardiac
hypertrophy, indicating that Vinexin-b plays an important
role in cardiovascular disease (Chen et al. 2013). However,
its functions in stroke are largely unknown. Herein, we
observed that Vinexin-b expression was elevated in our
stroke model, and we demonstrated that the deletion of
Vinexin-b in mice resulted in potent protection against
cerebral ischaemia via the attenuation of neuronal apoptosis
and that this effect of Vinexin-b was most likely mediated by
Akt signalling.

Materials and methods
Animals
All of the animal procedures were approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The animal
experiments were performed in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (NIH Publication No. 80-23, revised in 1996). The Vinexinb knockout mice (Vinexin-b/, C57BL/6 background) were generously provided by the RIKEN BioResource Center through the
National BioResource Project of the MEXT, Japan. The mice were
exposed to a 12-h light/dark cycle in a controlled temperature and
humidity environment. Food and water were provided ad libitum.

10 min and resuspended in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium/
F12 containing 20% foetal bovine serum. Then, the cells were
passed through 200-lm sterile ﬁlters and seeded on plates coated
with poly-L-lysine (10 mg/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The
neurons were cultured in Neurobasal medium (Gibco) supplemented
with B27 (Gibco) for 24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. AraC (10 lM,
Sigma) was added to inhibit cell proliferation. To mimic I/R
conditions in vitro, the neuronal cultures were exposed to transient
oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) for 60 min and subsequently returned to normal culture conditions for various periods.
During OGD, the Neurobasal medium was replaced with serumfree, glucose-free Locke’s buffer (154 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl,
2.3 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 3.6 mM NaHCO3, 5 mM HEPES
and 5 mg/mL gentamicin, pH 7.2), and the cultures were incubated
in an experimental hypoxia chamber containing a saturated atmosphere of 95% N2 and 5% CO2. The control cells were cultured in
the presence of normal levels of glucose in a humidiﬁed atmosphere
of 95% air and 5% CO2 for the same periods. To knock down
Vinexin-b expression in rat cortical neurons, we got three rat
shVinexin-constructs from SABiosciences (KR51403G, Valencia,
CA, USA) and generated three Ad-shVinexin-b adenoviruses as
previously described (Chen et al. 2013), then infected the rat
cortical neurons with these adenoviruses and choose the one that
signiﬁcantly decreased endogenous expression of Vinexin-b for
further experiments. Ad-shRNA was used as control.

Human brain tissue samples
Four human samples were obtained from patients with fatal
intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) in Xijing Hospital of the Fourth
Military Medical University as previously described (Chen et al.
2014), and the contralateral hemispheres served as controls for the
absence of haemorrhagic lesions. All the patients are male, and ages
are 58–67. Upon biopsy, the haemorrhagic area was removed, and
1 cm3 of adjacent perihaematomal brain tissue was obtained by an
experienced neuropathologist. All samples were instantaneously
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80°C within the ﬁrst 6 h
after death to avoid tissue degradation. The experimental protocol
was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xijing Hospital of the
Fourth Military Medical University, and written informed consent
was obtained from the family of the prospective brain donors.

Mouse transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model
Male mice aged 11–12 weeks (25–30 g) were subjected to cerebral
ischaemia, which was produced by occluding the left middle
cerebral artery using the intraluminal ﬁlament technique, as
described in previous studies (Wang et al. 2012; Chen et al.
2014; Xiang et al. 2014). Brieﬂy, after anaesthetization using 2.5–
3% isoﬂurane in O2, the mice were placed on a heating plate to
maintain a rectal temperature of 37  0.5°C. Transient middle
cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was achieved by introducing a 60 silicon-coated monoﬁlament (Doccol, Redland, CA, USA) into the
internal carotid artery via an incision in the left common carotid
artery. The ﬁlament was then advanced into the cerebral arterial
circle to obstruct the origin of the middle cerebral artery. The
obstruction and restoration of regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF)
were conﬁrmed via Doppler analysis (Periﬂux System 5010;
Perimed, J€arf€alla, Sweden). After 45 min of tMCAO, the ﬁlament
was withdrawn. rCBF was restored for the durations indicated in the
text. The animals were kept in the incubator for 2 h to recover, and
then were returned to the cages with free access to food and water
for indicated times and were killed for experiments. A similar
procedure was performed on the sham controls except that the
ﬁlament was withdrawn immediately after the rCBF was reduced.
The blood gases, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure
and heart rate were recorded in randomly selected conscious mice.

Rat cortical neuronal cell cultures and an in vitro model of
ischaemia
The cortices of SD rats were dissociated via incubation in 2 mL of
0.125% trypsin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) for 15 min at
37°C, followed by the addition of 4 mL of Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium (Gibco) containing 20% foetal bovine
serum (Gibco). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 184 g for

Neurological deficit scores
Neurological deﬁcits were assessed using a nine-point scale at 24
and 72 h after ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) as described previously
(Xia et al. 2006; Guo et al. 2014). The rating scale was as follows:
(1) absence of neurological deﬁcits (0 points); (2) left forelimb
ﬂexion upon suspension by the tail or failure to fully extend the right
forepaw (1 point); (3) left shoulder adduction upon suspension by

the tail (2 points); (4) reduced resistance to a lateral push towards the
left (3 points); (5) spontaneous movement in all directions with
circling to the left only if pulled by the tail (4 points); (6) circling or
walking spontaneously only to the left (5 points); (7) walking only
when stimulated (6 points); (8) no response to stimulation (7 points);
and (9) stroke-related death (8 points).
Measurement of the infarct volume
The mice were killed 24 h or 72 h after tMCAO, and their brains were
removed immediately. Then, the brains were sliced into seven
consecutive coronal 1-mm-thick sections (Wu et al. 2012; Guo et al.
2014). The sections were incubated in 2,3,5-triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
chloride staining solution for 30 min at 37°C and then ﬁxed in 10%
formalin solution overnight. The sections were imaged, and the volume
of the infarct area was quantiﬁed using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software
(Media Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). The infarct volume
percentage was calculated as follows: [(the volume of the contralateral
hemisphere  the volume of the non-lesioned ipsilateral hemisphere) 9 100]/(the volume of the contralateral hemisphere 9 2).
Immunofluorescence, TUNEL and Fluoro-Jade B staining
Immunoﬂuorescence was performed as previously described with some
modiﬁcations (Lu et al. 2013; Yan et al. 2013). The mice at 24 h after
cerebral I/R injury were anesthetized and perfused with 0.1 M sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min. The brains were rapidly
removed and ﬁxed in the same ﬁxative solution for 12 h at 252°C,
followed by immersion in 30% sucrose/PBS solution for 24 h at 4°C.
The brains were embedded in OCT solution and sliced into 5-lm-thick
cryosections. Alternatively, the neurons cultured on coverslips were
ﬁxed in ice-cold acetone. All sections on coverslips were washed in PBS
containing 10% goat serum and were incubated overnight at 4°C in the
following primary antibodies: mouse anti-NeuN (MAB377; 1 : 200;
Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), chicken anti-MAP2 (microtubuleassociated protein 2, Ab5392, 1 : 100; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit
anti-Vinexin-b (11312-1-AP, 1 : 200; Proteintech, Chicago, IL, USA),
rabbit anti-Bcl2 (#2870, 1 : 100; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA, USA) and rabbit anti-phosphorylated Akt (#4060, 1 : 50; Cell
Signaling Technology). The sections were washed in PBS and
incubated in the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h. The secondary
antibodies used were goat anti-chicken IgY (H&L, DyLightâ 488,
ab96947; Abcam), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
(A11004; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Alexa Fluor 568conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (A11011; Invitrogen). The nuclei were
labelled with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. For TUNEL (terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling) staining, the
sections were stained with TUNEL using an ApopTagâ Plus In Situ
Apoptosis Fluorescein Detection Kit (S7111; Millipore), according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. For Fluoro-Jade B staining, the sections
were stained with Fluoro-Jade B ﬂuorescent dye (AG310; Millipore)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A ﬂuorescence microscope
(Olympus DX51, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with DP2-BSW
software (version 2.2) was used to acquire the images, and the images
were analysed using Image-Pro Plus 6.0.
Tissue preparation
For quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis,
the mice at 2, 6, 12, 24 or 72 h after cerebral I/R injury were

213

anesthetized and perfused with cold PBS into the left ventricle.
Then, the brains were immediately removed. The olfactory bulbs
and 1-mm sections of the anterior and posterior brain tissue were
excised. The remaining tissues of the ipsilateral (including the
infarct and peri-infarct areas) and contralateral (or normal) hemispheres were collected. All tissues were immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at 80°C.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the frozen tissue using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and mRNA
(2 lg) was reverse-transcribed using the Transcriptor First-Strand
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Quantitative
RT-PCR analysis was performed using the LightCycler 480 SYBR
Green 1 Master Mix (Roche) and the LightCycler 480 QPCR
System (Roche). The PCR conditions were set as follows: 95°C for
10 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 10 s and 72°C for
20 s, and 72°C for 10 min. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase) was used as the internal control. The primers used
are shown in Table 1.
Western blot analysis
For western blotting, proteins were extracted from the brains
homogenized in lysis buffer. The extracted proteins (50 lg) were
separated on 8–12% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis gels and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membranes (Millipore). Next, the membranes were blocked in
TBST (Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20)
containing 5% skim milk powder for 1 h at 252°C and incubated
in the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Then, the membranes
were incubated in a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IRDye
800CW, 926-32211; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) for
1 h at 252°C. Subsequently, the membranes were treated with
enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (170-5061; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) prior to visualization using a Bio-Rad ChemiDocTM
XRS+ (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Bcl2 (#2870,
1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-Bax (#2772,
1 : 1000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-Bid (#2003,

Results
Vinexin-b expression is increased in neurons after cerebral I/
R injury
As the expression levels of a protein can initially reﬂect its
involvement in certain diseases, we ﬁrst detected the
expression of Vinexin-b in human brains from healthy
subjects and from patients who experienced an ICH, which
accounts for a high percentage of strokes (Qureshi et al.
2001). Although ICH is different from ischaemic stroke,
haemorrhagic accident may lead to a loss of blood supply by
increasing the pressure and blocking blood vessels, following

with signiﬁcant neuronal loss, which mimics the detrimental
cerebral injury and neuronal death in ischaemic stroke.
Interestingly, a signiﬁcant increase in Vinexin-b expression
was observed in the ICH tissues compared with the control

tissues (Fig. 1a). Next, we subjected wild-type mice to
tMCAO and reperfusion, and observed that Vinexin-b
expression was also up-regulated in a time-dependent
manner in the brains of mice subjected to I/R (Fig. 1b).

The expression of Vinexin-b was increased by 2.40-fold at
2 h after cerebral I/R and was further increased by 11.98-fold
at 72 h post-cerebral I/R compared with the sham injury
(Fig. 1b). Additionally, double-immunoﬂuorescence staining
for Vinexin-b and NeuN, a marker of neurons, showed that
Vinexin-b was primarily localized to neurons (Fig. 1c).
Furthermore, in accordance with our in vivo results, western
blotting and immunoﬂuorescence showed that the expression
of Vinexin-b was elevated in a time-dependent manner in rat
primary cortical neurons cultures subjected to OGD/restoration in vitro (Fig. 2a and b). Taken together, these results
demonstrated that Vinexin-b is involved in cerebral I/R
injury.

with the WT controls (3.60  0.61% vs. 7.53  0.64%,
p < 0.05). This decrease was also signiﬁcant at 72 h postinjury (5.80  1.39% vs. 9.95  0.87%, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3b
and c). Additionally, the Vinexin-b KO mice attained
decreased scores on the neurological assessment scale than
the WT controls after cerebral I/R (24 h, 2.33  0.21 vs.
3.33  0.33, p < 0.05; 72 h, 2.40  0.25 vs. 3.40  0.25,
p < 0.05) (Fig. 3d). Together, these results demonstrated
that the deletion of Vinexin-b protects against cerebral I/R
injury.

Deletion of vinexin-b protects against cerebral I/R injury in
mice
Based on our ﬁndings that Vinexin-b expression was
signiﬁcantly increased in both human ICH and mouse
cerebral I/R injury model, we next investigated the functions
of Vinexin-b in I/R injury in vivo using Vinexin-b knockout
mice. The western blot results showed that Vinexin-b
expression was undetectable in the brains of the Vinexin-b
knockout (Vinexin-b KO) mice compared with those of the
wild-type (WT) control mice (Fig. 3a). Subsequently, both
the Vinexin-b KO and WT mice were subjected to tMCAO
followed by reperfusion. We observed that Vinexin-b
deﬁciency potently protected against cerebral I/R injury. At
24 h after cerebral I/R, the brain infarct volumes were
signiﬁcantly decreased in the Vinexin-b KO mice compared

Vinexin-b deficiency inhibited neuronal apoptosis after
cerebral ischaemic injury
Considering that Vinexin-b expression was elevated primarily in neurons and that neuronal apoptosis is a critical
pathological process during ischaemic stroke (Doyle et al.
2008), we evaluated whether Vinexin-b KO protected against
cerebral I/R via the suppression of neuronal apoptosis.
Fluoro-Jade B and TUNEL were used to evaluate neuronal
death and apoptosis, respectively. Immunoﬂuorescence
staining showed a signiﬁcantly reduced percentage of
Fluoro-Jade B- and TUNEL-positive cells in the Vinexin-b
KO mice compared with the WT controls after cerebral I/R
(Fig. 4a and b). Additionally, the mRNA expression of the
pro-apoptotic genes Fas, FasL, Bax and Bad was dramatically decreased but the expression of the anti-apoptotic genes
Bcl2 and Bcl-xL was signiﬁcantly increased in the Vinexin-b
KO mice compared with the WT mice following cerebral I/R
(Fig. 5a). Accordingly, the protein expression of Bax, Bid,

Bak and cleaved caspase-3 was signiﬁcantly down-regulated,
but that of Bcl2 was upregulated in the Vinexin-b KO mice
after cerebral I/R (Fig. 5b). Immunoﬂuorescence staining
further conﬁrmed that Bcl2 was signiﬁcantly increased in
neurons in the brains of Vinexin-b KO mice (Fig. 5c). To
further conﬁrm whether Vinexin-b deﬁciency suppresses
neuronal apoptosis, we knock down Vinexin-b in the primary
rat neurons, and observed a signiﬁcant decrease in Bax, Bid,
Bak and cleaved caspase-3 expression and an increase in
Bcl2 expression in the primary rat neurons infected with AdshVinexin-b compared with the neurons infected with AdshRNA in response to OGD/perfusion injury in vitro
(Fig. 5d). Collectively, these results demonstrated that the
deletion of Vinexin-b in mice suppresses neuronal apoptosis
after I/R injury.

whether the Vinexin-b deﬁciency-associated inhibition of
stroke evoked brain injury occurred via the regulation of Akt
signalling. To conﬁrm this hypothesis, we measured the
expression of Akt in the brains of Vinexin-b KO and WT
control mice subjected to I/R or no injury. The western blot
results showed that the levels of p-Akt, p-GSK3b and pFOXO3A were comparable in the absence of injury but were
signiﬁcantly increased in the Vinexin-b KO mice after I/R
injury (Fig. 6a). Immunoﬂuorescence staining further demonstrated that the elevated expression of p-Akt was primarily
localized to neurons (Fig. 6b). In accordance with the in vivo
results, a similar tendency was also observed in the primary
rat neurons infected with Ad-shVinexin-b in response to
OGD/restoration injury in vitro (Fig. 6c). Thus, these results
demonstrated that Vinexin-b inhibits the Akt signalling
pathway in neurons after I/R injury.

Vinexin-b deficiency increases Akt activity in neurons after
I/R injury
We previously showed that Vinexin-b protected against heart
hypertrophy by attenuating Akt signalling (Chen et al.
2013), and Akt has been demonstrated to regulate stroke
outcomes after injury (Zhao et al. 2005). Next, we evaluated

increased in both human ICH and mouse tMCAO model
brain tissues in vivo and in primary mouse neurons cultures
subjected to OGD/restoration in vitro. Next, using Vinexin-b
KO mice, we demonstrated that the deletion of Vinexin-b
potently protected against I/R injury. Mechanistically, Vinexin-b deﬁciency dramatically attenuated neuronal apoptosis
and increased the expression of Akt signalling effectors in
the brains of Vinexin-b KO mice after 1/R injury.
Vinexin-b is expressed ubiquitously, although at particularly high levels in the heart (Kioka et al. 1999). Our
previous study showed that Vinexin-b expression was
decreased in chronic pressure overload-induced cardiac
hypertrophy and that the deletion of Vinexin-b promoted
cardiac hypertrophy in mice (Chen et al. 2013). In contrast,
in this study, a signiﬁcant increase in Vinexin-b expression
was observed in the brain after cerebral ischaemic injury, and
the deletion of Vinexin-b potently protected against I/R
injury. This contrasting effect of Vinexin-b is intriguing; this
result may be because of the different cell types involved or
the different stimuli to which Vinexin-b responded. The
mechanism by which Vinexin-b expression is increased after
I/R injury is currently unknown. Thus, it will be interesting
to elucidate the mechanism by which I/R injury induces
Vinexin-b expression in a future study.
Neuronal apoptosis is an important pathological process
during ischaemic stroke (Broughton et al. 2009). Previous
studies have shown that the inhibition of neuronal apoptosis
prevents ischaemic injury (Rabuffetti et al. 2000; Yepes
et al. 2000). We found that the deletion of Vinexin-b
signiﬁcantly inhibited neuronal apoptosis, which was demonstrated by decreased expression of pro-apoptotic genes and
increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes in the brain of
Vinexin-b KO mice after I/R injury. Vinexin-b is well
known to regulate cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization
and cell spreading (Kioka et al. 1999). To the best of our
knowledge, this study provides the ﬁrst evidence that
Vinexin-b plays an important role in modulating cell
apoptosis.
Akt signalling pathways support cell survival and block
neuronal death after stroke (Chan 2004; Zhao et al. 2005).
Akt is normally phosphorylated in the non-ischaemic brain,

and its expression is increased after reperfusion in focal,
global and in vitro ischaemia models (Jin et al. 2000b; Li
et al. 2003; Osuka et al. 2004). Many studies have
demonstrated that the exogenous application of growth
factors protects against stroke by activating the Akt
pathway (Jin et al. 2000a; Brywe et al. 2005; Hui et al.
2005). Additionally, Akt signalling has been shown to
inhibit apoptosis in multiple cell types under various
pathophysiological conditions (Patten et al. 2004; Xiao and
Singh 2006). Akt directly phosphorylates the Bcl-2 family
member Bad, decreasing pro-apoptotic gene expression
(Xiao and Singh 2006), and GSK3b blocks cytochrome c
release and caspase-3 activation, suppressing apoptosis
(Watcharasit et al. 2003). Our previous studies showed that
Mindin, TNF receptor-associated factor 1 and 5 play
important roles in stroke via Akt-mediated neuronal
apoptosis (Lu et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013a,b). In this
study, we found that Vinexin-b deﬁciency signiﬁcantly upregulated the Akt signalling pathway as demonstrated by
the increases in the p-Akt, p-GSK3b and p-FOXO3A
levels. These ﬁndings implied that the inhibitory effects of
Vinexin-b on cerebral ischaemic injury and neuronal
apoptosis may be because of the up-regulation of the Akt
signalling pathway. However, whether Akt directly mediates these effects of Vinexin-b requires further
investigation.
In conclusion, our present results demonstrated that
Vinexin-b expression is increased in ischaemic brain tissue,
and Vinexin-b deﬁciency protects against cerebral ischaemic injury by attenuating neuronal apoptosis in response to
I/R injury, and that the Akt signalling pathway most likely
contributes to these effects of Vinexin-b. We found that
Vinexin-b is a newly recognized regulator of I/R injury,
and we propose that Vinexin-b may represent an attractive
therapeutic target for the treatment of ischaemic stroke.
