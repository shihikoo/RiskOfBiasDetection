Background
Rapid diagnosis for time-sensitive illnesses such as stroke, cardiac arrest, and septic shock
is essential for successful treatment. Much attention has therefore focused on new strategies for rapid and objective diagnosis, such as Point-of-Care Tests (PoCT) for blood biomarkers. Here we use a biomimicry-based approach to demonstrate a new diagnostic
platform, based on enzymes tethered to nanoparticles (NPs). As proof of principle, we use
oriented immobilization of pyruvate kinase (PK) and luciferase (Luc) on silica NPs to
achieve rapid and sensitive detection of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a clinically relevant
biomarker for multiple diseases ranging from acute brain injuries to lung cancer. We hypothesize that an approach capitalizing on the speed and catalytic nature of enzymatic reactions
would enable fast and sensitive biomarker detection, suitable for PoCT devices.

Methods and findings
We performed in-vitro, animal model, and human subject studies. First, the efficiency of
coupled enzyme activities when tethered to NPs versus when in solution was tested, demonstrating a highly sensitive and rapid detection of physiological and pathological concentrations of NSE. Next, in rat stroke models the enzyme-based assay was able in minutes to
show a statistically significant increase in NSE levels in samples taken 1 hour before and 0,
1, 3 and 6 hours after occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery. Finally, using the tethered enzyme assay for detection of NSE in samples from 20 geriatric human patients, we
show that our data match well (r = 0.815) with the current gold standard for biomarker detection, ELISA—with a major difference being that we achieve detection in 10 minutes as
opposed to the several hours required for traditional ELISA.

Conclusions
Oriented enzyme immobilization conferred more efficient coupled activity, and thus higher
assay sensitivity, than non-tethered enzymes. Together, our findings provide proof of concept for using oriented immobilization of active enzymes on NPs as the basis for a highly
rapid and sensitive biomarker detection platform. This addresses a key challenge in developing a PoCT platform for time sensitive and difficult to diagnose pathologies.

Introduction
There is pressing need for quick and objective diagnostic technologies for both time sensitive
and difficult to diagnose pathologies. Much attention has therefore focused on the identification of disease-specific peripheral biomarkers, and use of new technologies to improve antibody-based detection capabilities. This interest is well justified because of the enormous
medical, social and economic impacts of these diseases, in both developed and developing
countries. This manuscript presents data about an alternative technological approach to biomarker detection—the use of enzymes tethered to NPs. For proof of principle, we’ll focus on a
single biomarker, NSE, that has been suggested to have value for diagnosing various pathologies (particularly those involving the central nervous system). No single biomarker is known to
be sensitive and specific enough to diagnose a complex neural disease state. Rather, we present
these data as proof of principle for the underlying diagnostic platform suitable for rapid detection of biomarker analytes.
Stroke is one of the best examples of a brain disease that is both hard to diagnose and time
sensitive, annually affecting over 15 million people. Of these, 5 million die and an additional
5 million are left permanently disabled [1]. Currently, its diagnosis relies on neurologists to distinguish stroke from mimics using advanced imaging tests (e.g. CT, MRI) in order to determine
whether the stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic. If appropriate, thrombolytic treatment can
then be initiated, but is most effective only within a short 3–4 hour window from onset [2].
Remarkably, due to the time constraints for initiating effective treatment, lack of prompt diagnosis for ischemic stroke results in less than 4% of patients in the US receiving thrombolytic
therapy [3]. In addition to rapid diagnosis of stroke, there is growing military and civilian need
for PoCT devices that provide objective, biomarker-based, diagnostic and prognostic information regarding traumatic brain injuries (TBI/concussion), and neurodegenerative disease [e.g.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD)]. For these brain injuries, an objective
PoCT could lead to interventions beginning early upon the onset of disease as well as provide a
platform to monitor disease progression or response to therapy. From a global perspective, the
increasing incidence of stroke in developing countries [4], the high cost and limited availability
of health resources associated with stroke diagnosis, significantly reduces favorable outcomes
[5].
Traditional technologies for blood biomarker diagnostics include ELISA, PCR, and mass
spectrometry (MS). However, these technologies are limited to laboratory use because they
require sample preparation, and use of sophisticated instruments and highly trained technicians. Moreover, they are time and labor intensive, and are expensive [6]. Much of the research
on detection of blood biomarkers has focused on antibody-based methods. Although there has
been considerable progress in the field, such as the introduction of lateral flow based assays,
constraints due to the speed of antibody-antigen interactions, low sensitivity, semi-quantitative
results and the complexity of associated detection instrumentation have thus far prevented

such antibody capture methods from becoming the basis for a field-capable PoCT device to
detect brain injuries [6].
Over the last few decades, a large number of molecules have been studied for their potential
usefulness as blood-borne biomarkers. Although no single biomarker will likely provide a
definitive diagnosis of any disease, the glycolytic enzyme, NSE, is released from damaged neurons and has been suggested to be valuable for the diagnosis of various brain injuries [7] [8]
[9]. Evidence also supports its usefulness as a prognostic indicator in predicting neurological
outcomes of post-cardiac arrest [10] and mild TBI [11]. NSE has been suggested to be useful in
distinguishing stroke from mimics, an important first step in expediting the diagnostic process
[7]. In addition, it has been suggested that changes in serum NSE levels may indicate changes
in brain morphology in AD [12]. Overall, changes in plasma NSE levels are of clinical significance to several of the major brain injuries, making it an excellent first candidate to test a new
diagnostic platform technology.
As an alternative to antibody capture, fluid phase enzymatic reactions have been used to
detect plasma NSE by means of its enzymatic activity [13] [14]; however, in the 30 years since
these assays were first described, to our knowledge, no related PoCT technologies have been
reported. Semi-solid phase bioluminescence detection of NSE through its binding to immunobeads enabled high sensitivity detection [15]. However, this method required long serum-bead
incubation times and did not tether the downstream enzymes (i.e. PK and Luc). Tethering
enzymes has several advantages for a PoCT, such as concentrating the detection reaction, spatially localizing the readout, and potentially improving shelf life. The principle obstacle lies in
maintaining enzymatic function when immobilizing enzymes. Immobilization often interferes
with substrate binding sites and/or needed conformational changes [16].
To overcome this obstacle, we adopted a strategy of biomimicry, inspired by the tethering of
glycolytic enzymes to a cytoskeletal scaffold in the sperm flagellum, where they provide localized energy production [17] [18]. We previously showed that oriented immobilization via
genetically-encoded binding domains conferred advantages in specific activity versus either
random adsorption or chemically-specific binding [19, 20]. Here, we extend our previous studies [19] [20] in a novel direction, to generate a PoCT platform based on enzymes tethered to
nanoparticles via biomimetic oriented immobilization (Tethered Enzyme Technology, TET).
Our approach couples production of ATP by PK with activity of firefly luciferase (Luc) to generate a highly rapid and sensitive bioluminescent readout for the detection of NSE. As a tethering scaffold for the PoCT device, we employed SiO2 nanoparticles for their many positive
attributes: high biocompatibility, low optical absorption, dispersibility, high surface area, and
the ability to be integrated into various devices with spatial control. We hypothesized that oriented immobilization of PK and Luc on SiO2 NPs could provide the basis for highly rapid,
quantitative and sensitive detection of NSE through an enzymatic cascade reaction in a form
suitable for use in a PoCT.

Results
We have previously shown that oriented immobilization of the glycolytic enzymes, TPI and
GAPDH, enhances both their individual activities as well as the activity of their coupled
sequential reactions in comparison to enzymes tethered via chemically-specific but non-oriented carboxyl-amine binding [20]. To test whether this would hold true for the coupled
sequential reactions of PK and the non-glycolytic enzyme Luc, we generated mammalian
PK and Luc expression plasmids, each as a fusion protein with two affinity tags, as described in
the Materials and Methods section. Each of the constructs included an amino-terminal

silica-binding peptide sequence (Si-tag) [21, 22] for immobilization of proteins onto SiO2
nanoparticles (Si-NPs) and a 6xHis-tag to be used for protein purification (Fig 1A, see also S1
Fig).
To test our hypothesis that oriented immobilization would impart an improvement on the
specific activity of the coupled reaction (Fig 1B), we measured the coupled activities of various
combinations of tethered and free PK and Luc (Fig 1C and S2 Fig). Analysis of all four possible
combinations revealed a significant increase in the readout signal when Luc was immobilized
(green triangles, 3.01±0.2 fold, p<0.001) and an even larger increase upon immobilization of
both Luc and PK (black circles, 4.25±0.12 fold, p<0.001). When Luc was in solution (not tethered), the coupled activity of the PK-Luc reaction was reduced, regardless of whether PK was
in solution or tethered, suggesting that having Luc in close proximity with the source of ATP
production (PK) was crucial for increased coupled reaction efficiency.
To investigate further the source of the improvement in Luc activity when tethered, we compared Luc in-solution versus immobilized. In agreement with previous findings [23], our measurements revealed a 10-fold average reduction in the sensitivity to ATP of immobilized Luc
(data not shown). However, Luc tethered on the Si-NPs exhibited extended photon emission
dynamics, with a slower decay rate when compared to the soluble protein (S2B Fig). The differences in the enzymatic activity of immobilized Luc might result from a change in diffusion
resistance and/or a slowing of kinetics due to conformational constraints. In terms of the
PK-Luc coupled reaction, the reduction in Luc sensitivity was most likely compensated for by
the prolonged emission kinetics. For example, placing Luc in closer proximity to PK (such as
occurs with particle packing) would enhance the efficiency of ATP channeling by reducing the
diffusion distance and effective local reaction volume, thereby increasing the effective local
concentration of ATP, and enhancing luminescence output. Additional investigations of the
impacts of enzyme tethering/proximity can be found as supplemental material (S2 and S4
Figs).
We next hypothesized that the increased efficiency of the immobilized coupled reactions
might provide a sensitive and rapid luminescence based assay for detection of the biomarker
NSE, through a 3-step coupled reaction as follows–enolase/NSE catalyzes the conversion of
2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), PK in turn converts PEP and ADP
to pyruvate and ATP, with the latter being used by Luc to generate a photon of light. We first
tested this hypothesis using the non-neuronal isoform α-enolase (ENO). The sensitivity of the
tethered enzymes (red, PK and Luc tethered separately to NPs) was significantly higher than
that of freely diffusing enzymes (blue) when detecting ENO activity (Fig 2A). In particular,
higher sensitivity of the PK-Luc coupled reaction was observed at lower ENO concentrations
(Fig 2A inset).
Next, we sought to determine whether the NP-PK and NP-Luc coupled reaction could
detect physiologically relevant concentrations of human NSE (< 8.7 ± 3.9 ng/ml [24]). Fig 2B
shows a representative dose response experiment where sub-physiological amounts of commercial human NSE were added to the reaction mixture in the presence of NP-PK and NP-Luc
(tethered separately). The luminescent signal generated by Luc was integrated over 10 minutes,
showing statistically significant differences for each concentration of NSE. These results indicate that using immobilized PK-Luc coupled reactions provides sub-physiological sensitivity
for NSE, at concentrations well below typical pathological plasma levels, with rapid detection
times.
The improved sensitivity and kinetics of NSE detection with the tethered coupled enzymatic
reactions encouraged us to test our biomarker detection assays in the complex environment of
blood plasma. For these experiments, we used a rat model for stroke, in the form of a focal
stroke that was induced by clotting the distal branches of the middle cerebral artery (MCA).

and a reading from the zero NSE well was subtracted from the collected signal. The sensitivity of the tethered

by subtracting a negative control reaction (lacking the NSE substrate, 2-PG) from the test reaction (that included 2-PG). Fig 3E summarizes the data collected from 10 rats (5 stroke and 5

detection technology. Consistent with the results from the coupled enzymatic assay at that

same time point, the ELISA revealed a 2-fold increase in NSE concentration at 6 hours post
stroke (Fig 3F). No elevation was found in non-neuronal isoforms of enolase (NNE) as measured using a NNE ELISA kit (data not shown), demonstrating that the source of enolase activity that we measured was indeed NSE. Importantly, while the measurements of NSE
concentration using the “gold standard” ELISA assays took over 3 hours, the TET based assay
provided results within 10 minutes.
Moving forward from an animal model, we next tested TET’s ability to detect NSE in the
even less defined environment of human plasma. Blood samples were collected from consenting patients seen at the Central New York Alzheimer’s Disease Assistance Center (ADAC) at
SUNY Upstate Medical University using Na-Heparin tubes. Plasma was then divided with a
portion of the sample tested immediately using TET and the rest frozen at -80°C for later confirmation via commercial ELISA. We ran this experiment using TET in the form of a first generation PoCT technology for human NSE testing. Namely, reactions were designed to work
with minimal plasma volume in white 96 well plates in which all test and control reaction components had been lyophilized. 10 μl of freshly collected plasma was added into pre-loaded wells
and the light output was measured with a conventional plate reader. TET reaction reading was
completed within 10 minutes from the addition of plasma to the pre-loaded wells, where each
test included triplicate negative control wells (reaction lacking 2PG), positive control wells
(pre-loaded with enolase) and test wells, so that a total of 90 μl of plasma was used for each subject tested (a volume able to be obtained from less than 4 drops of blood). Importantly, using a
positive control reaction including known amounts of spiked Eno, allowed us to normalize the
data between experiments and minimize any variabilities that might arise from batch to batch
differences in enzyme activity. To validate the accuracy of the TET results (representative data

shown in Fig 4A), plasma samples were sent for lab testing (ARUP labs, Salt Lake City, UT).
Using a Pearson’s correlation test, we compared TET and ELISA data finding a significant correlation of 0.81 between the two approaches (Fig 4B).

Discussion
Our results suggest that enzymes tethered via oriented immobilization can provide a PoCT
platform enabling simple, rapid and objective testing for biomarkers associated with hard to
diagnose and time sensitive diseases. We focused on NSE for this proof of concept because it
has been shown to convey clinically relevant information for several brain injuries and cancers.
Immobilized enzymes present several important advantages for medical applications
including stability and spatial organization in a device, whether with a microfluidic card or
paper chromatography. Of note, our data show that oriented enzyme immobilization also significantly improved the efficiency with which coupled enzymatic reactions occurred. This is of
special importance because use of coupled enzymatic reactions allows signal amplification at
both the stages of biomarker detection and transduction of signal into the luminescent readout.
When combined with the inherently enhanced sensitivity and speed of catalytic activity, tethered enzymes provide some of the highly desired features expected from a PoCT diagnostic
platform. Demonstrating their suitability for this purpose, we showed in vitro the advantages
of using tethered versus soluble enzymes. We showed that TET-based systems could detect
physiologically and pathologically relevant concentrations. Importantly, the immobilized
enzyme-based detection system provided an ultra-rapid analysis (i.e. within 10 minutes) even
when using plasma samples obtained from rat stroke models or human patients.
The high correlation between ELISA and TET suggests circulating NSE enzymatic activity
corresponds very well with the amount of protein. This comparison between TET and ELISA
in detection of NSE raises another important finding regarding the dynamic range for detection
provided by these two methods. Whereas the ELISA method provides a linear detection range,
the enzyme-based assay offers close to a 2-fold larger dynamic range (as defined by the difference between the smallest and largest usable signal, and calculated from the max to min values
for each assay). Along with the increased assay speed (minutes for TET vs. hours for ELISA),
minimal user effort (TET is a “mix and test” assay, while ELISA requires multiple wash steps),
this finding revealing the increased sensitivity of TET versus antibody capture techniques provides another feature contributing to the improvements of TET over ELISA.
One potential criticism of use of tethered enzymes is that the range of biomarkers able to be
detected through enzymatic reactions represents a limited subset of target analytes. However,
there are numerous biomarkers with bona fide enzymatic activity (e.g. nucleoside diphosphate
kinase A; NDKA [25], and phosphoglycerate mutase; PGM [26]), or are modulators of enzyme
activity (e.g. calcium [27], magnesium [28]), or are substrates and metabolites of enzymatic
reactions (e.g. glutamate and glucose [29]). Currently, no single biomarker, including NSE, can
accurately and definitively diagnose any disease. Therefore, we are designing and testing TETbased approaches for multiple classes of target analytes, beyond enzymes. This will allow us to
simultaneously quantify suites of biomarkers, significantly increasing the accuracy and robustness of the diagnostic test.
Together, our data support further investigations of enzymes tethered to NPs via oriented
immobilization in PoCT diagnostics. The advantages of spatial control of enzyme activities,
and rapid and sensitive detection with signal amplification at both detection and transduction
into luminescence output, combine to make TET a highly attractive alternative to antibodybased detection. These attributes are especially attractive for integrating TET into a PoCT technology for use by paramedics, athletic trainers and in the field. In terms of lack of need for

Experimental Design
The aim of this study was to explore the advantages of utilizing enzymes tethered via oriented
immobilization in the detection of NSE, a neuronal injury biomarker, towards development of
a PoCT technology for time sensitive illnesses.
The study was designed to follow 3 successive stages: (i) Test the enzyme-based assay in
vitro to examine the effects of oriented enzyme immobilization on the sensitivity and efficiency
of the solid phase vs fluid phase reaction. (ii) Test the tethered enzyme assay in plasma from a
rat stroke model. Here, to simulate stroke, 2 groups of rats underwent craniectomy under anesthesia, and branches of the MCA were cauterized in the test group. Peripheral blood samples
were drawn over a time period of 6 hours to monitor changes in NSE level. Finally, the changes
in NSE levels as measured with TET were compared to those obtained with ELISA. (iii) Use
pre-filled 96 well plates in a comparative analysis of NSE plasma levels in samples taken from
human subjects and measured by both the solid phase TET reaction and ELISA.

Reagents
Enliten ATP detection kit was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). 2-PG, PEP, ADP,
ATP, luciferin, PK antibody, NSE, and yeast α-enolase were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
pcDNA4/HisMax TOPO TA vector was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Si-NPs (500 nm)
were purchased from Spherotech Inc. (Lake Forest, IL).

Construction of His-Si4 fusion proteins
The complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) of PK was obtained by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from mouse muscle RNA. The Luc2 sequence was
amplified from the Luciferase2 plasmid, Promega (Madison, WI).
His-PK and His-Luc were generated by TA cloning of PK and Luc into pcDNA4/HisMax
TOPO TA. To generate the His-Si4 vector, two complementary oligonucleotides (Integrated
DNA Technologies, Inc. USA) encoding the Si4 sequence [22] with overhanging A were
hybridized and cloned into the TA site of the pcDNA4/HisMax TOPO TA plasmid, followed
by restriction/ligation of PCR fragments of PK and Luc to make His-Si4-plasmids. Subsequently, the Si4-PK and Si4-Luc sequences were amplified by PCR and inserted into
pcDNA3.1 to make Si4-PK and Si4-Luc. Constructs were validated by sequencing and amplified in TOP10 cells and then purified.

Protein expression and purification
HEK293-F-FreeStyle cells (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) were transfected with plasmids
encoding His, His-Si4 or Si4 fusion proteins using the Freestyle MAX reagent (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY) and incubated for 24–72 hrs in 8% CO2. Cells were harvested and lysed by
sonication (Sonifier 250, Branson, Danbury, CT). His-tag or His-Si4 fusion proteins were purified on Ni/NTA beads as previously described [30], with the exception that the Si4 tag was
used to immobilize PK on silica NPs directly from the cell lysate (S1D and S1E Fig), providing
a fast and simpler purification process.

Enzymatic activity assays
Enzyme activities for both single and coupled reactions were assessed via luminescence output,
in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM) supplemented with MgCl2 (5 mM) and KCl (20 mM).
The forward reaction for PK is: PEP + ADP ! pyruvate + ATP. The forward reaction for
Luc is: ATP + luciferin + Mg2+ ! hν. The PK and Luc coupled reaction is: PEP + ADP ! pyruvate + ATP + luciferin ! hν. All experiments were carried out in 96-well black or white plates
at room temperature. Purified or immobilized PK was mixed with Enliten luciferase/luciferin
reagent in addition to ADP and PEP as indicated for individual experiments. Purified or immobilized Luc was mixed with luciferin, Mg2+, K+ and ATP as indicated in individual experiments
and activity was monitored by means of light emission as detected by a luminometer (GloMax,
Promega, Madison, WI), where the luminescence signal was integrated for 3 seconds every
minute for up to 50 minutes, as indicated per each experiment. To assess the activity of the coupled reactions, PK and luciferase were mixed as indicated above, with luciferin, ADP and PEP,
and light emission was measured by luminescence. To maximize enzyme activity per NP, protein was added in saturating amounts to the NPs [31].Data processing and analysis were carried out using Excel (Microsoft) and Origin (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA). In experiments
with internal repetitions, data are presented as average ± standard deviation. Otherwise, representative experiments are shown that were repeated independently at least three times with
similar results.

Detection of NSE in rat stroke model
Surgery and occlusion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) with
average weight 400 g (std. dev. 83 g, range 260–530 g) were used in these experiments. Only
males were used, to eliminate potentially confounding effects from the stage of estrus cycle.
Animals were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in oxygen and were maintained on 1.3–2.0% isoflurane. Anesthesia was adjusted to maintain both constant breathing rate of ~1 Hz, measured
manually, and suppression of pedal withdrawal reflex. Rats were free breathing. In previous
work [32], we have found that with these parameters it is not necessary to artificially ventilate
animals for consistent cortical blood flow. Body temperature was maintained at 37.5°C with a
feedback controlled rectal thermometer. Glycopyrrolate (50 mg/100 g rat) was injected intramuscularly to suppress fluid buildup in the lungs. Rats were placed in a stereotaxic device and
incision locations were shaved, cleaned and injected with bupivacaine (0.125%, s.c.) for analgesia. The femoral artery was catheterized with PE 50 tubing for arterial blood draws. The skin
and muscle on the right side of the skull were retracted, and a craniectomy was drilled from the
temporal bone to just above the zygomatic arch. The dura was reflected. In experimental stroke
animals, branches of the MCA were cauterized at both the entry and exit points from the field
of view so that there was no flow visible in the exposed branches of the MCA. In sham animals
no cauterization was used. The occlusion procedure took approximately 15 minutes, with time
0 recorded at the end of the occlusion procedure. The occlusions were visually checked every

15 minutes to ensure that the clots remained. In a few animals, some vessels became patent
within the first hour and were recauterized. Experiments were conducted in matched pairs of
sham animals and stroke animals. Blood (0.5 ml) was drawn at 1 hour before occlusion (or
sham), and after 0, 1, 3 and 6 hours post occlusion. In order to avoid dilution, flushing of the
catheter was minimized. Fluids were replenished by subcutaneous injection of 0.5 ml of 5% glucose after every blood collection.
After the last blood draw, animals were overdosed with pentobarbital. Chest cavities were
opened before the heart beat ceased and in some cases blood was drawn from a ventricular cardiac puncture. Animals were intracardially perfused with ~150 ml PBS and 300 mL 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Heads were stored in paraformaldehyde. Images were taken of each
brain after extraction and before sectioning.
Fluoro-Jade C Staining. Brains were harvested and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose and
then 60% sucrose for at least 24 hour each. Brains were frozen and cut into coronal, 45-μm sections on a cryotome. For Fluoro-Jade C (FJC; Millipore) staining, sections were washed in 80%
EtOH in 1% NaOH for five minutes, 70% EtOH for 2 minutes, and 0.06% KMnO4 for 10 minutes. Sections were then incubated in the solution of 0.00015% of FJC solution (1:100 stock,
according to manufacturer’s instructions, dissolved in 0.1% of acetic acid) for 20 minutes. Sections were then washed with distilled water 3 times, for 1 minute each, at which time the slides
were dried for 5 minutes and put into xylene solution for 5 minutes. Last, slides were dried for
an hour and coverslipped with Permount (Electron Microscopy Sciences). Initially, FJC staining was performed at 1 mm-spacing throughout the brain. After the most anterior and posterior sections with FJC staining were identified, additional sections were stained to resolve the
stroke volume with 200–300 μm spacing.
Measurement of rat brain infarct volume and torn tissue area. Low magnification white
light images of the entire section were photographed under a stereoscope. FJC staining was
imaged with epifluorescence under 20x magnification using filters for FITC. The area labeled
with FJC was manually identified by a person blinded to the treatment and marked on the low
magnification, white light images of whole brain sections using ImageJ. For figures, images
were normalized by calculating the mean and standard deviation of manually selected background region and then setting the minimum intensity to 4.2 x standard deviation below the
mean, and maximum intensity to 7.2 x standard deviation above the mean. Total FJC volume
was obtained by multiplying each section’s infarct area by the distance between sections.
In some sections, a part of tissue was torn in the stroke region. To compensate for missing
tissue volume, the torn tissue area was obtained by subtracting the area of the ipsilateral from
the contralateral side as calculated from the low magnification images. The volume of torn tissue was obtained by multiplying each section’s missing tissue by the distance between sections.
The torn tissue volume was then added to the FJC volume to calculate the total stroke volume.
Measurements of NSE activity and quantification by ELISA. Plasma was separated from
whole blood samples using CAPIJECT Micro Collection Tubes (Terumo Medical Corporation,
Somerset NJ). 50 μl samples of plasma were added to individual wells in a 96-well plate, and
reaction mix was added just before luminescence measurements were initiated (GloMax, Promega). Reaction mixtures included 1:1 ratio of NP-PK and NP-Luc, with equal mass amounts
of enzyme bound to the NPs, resulting in roughly a 2:1 ratio of Luc to PK molecules. To minimize batch-to-batch differences in repeat experiments, the amounts of the NP-PK and the
NP-Luc to be added was based on their individual activities. In this way, the relative activities
of each enzyme were kept constant among experiments with different batches of protein.
Luminescence signal was integrated for 3 seconds, every minute for 50 minutes. Control wells
(-2PG) were then subtracted from the raw data and LU were integrated over the first 20

minutes of the measurements. Integrated LU values of each time point were then normalized
to t (-1 hour).
Rat NSE was quantified using an ELISA Kit, (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer’s directions. Non-Neuronal Enolase (NNE) was also detected using
ELISA Kit, (antibodies-online.com, Atlanta, GA) according to manufacturer’s directions.
Assays were read using an Infinite M200Pro microplate reader (Tecan Trading AG, Maennedorf, Switzerland) and Magellan software (Tecan Austria GmbH, Grödig/Salzburg, Austria).

Detection of NSE in blood samples from human subjects
Plasma sample collection. 5 ml of blood was collected from enrolled subjects into Naheparin 6 ml tubes. Tubes were spun at 1000 g for 5 minutes and then plasma was aspirated
and placed over ice. Samples were divided and aliquots frozen for later analysis as indicated.
Detection of NSE in plasma samples from human subjects. 10 μl of freshly collected
plasma was diluted with 10 μl of water and added to individual wells of a 96-well plate preloaded with lyophilized TET reagent mixtures for negative, test and positive control wells
(in triplicates). The readout luminescence signal was integrated for 0.4 seconds, and read
continuously for 25 minutes using a TECAN Safire plate reader. For calculation of NSE levels,
the linear regression slope for the initial activity was calculated per each well. Then, control
wells (-2PG) were subtracted from the test channel and normalized to the positive control well
(with 2-PG and enolase). Positive control reactions allowed us to normalize the results to
reduce batch to batch variability. Plasma samples were sent for further analysis to ARUP laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT). Variability for PK and Luc activity between batches was addressed
by preparing mixtures of the enzymes with equal activity rather than adding equal amounts of
each protein.

S1 Fig. Construction and expression of PK-affinity tag fusion constructs. A) Schematic
illustration of fusion PK constructs indicating location of the His and Si4 peptide sequences.
Three fusion plasmids were constructed for PK–His-PK, His-Si-PK and Si-PK. B) HEK-293
cells were transfected with each of the 3 plasmids. 3 days later, cell lysates were separated by
SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotted for PK expression, where His-PK showed highest expression level. C) His-PK and His-Si-PK were purified (using the His-tag, see methods section) and
tested for their specific activity when not tethered. Protein concentrations were determined
with the Micro-BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL), and purity of the samples was analyzed by
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. D) Immunoblot (top) and quantification (bottom) of protein
bound to 500 nm SiO2 NPs following incubation with whole cell lysates of His-PK, His-Si4-PK
or Si4-PK expressing cells. This comparison shows that the Si tag increases >2 fold the amount
of protein bound to SiO2 NPs. E) The activity of His-PK, His-Si4-PK or Si4-PK fusion proteins
was measured when immobilized on SiO2 NPs following incubation of whole cell lysates with
the 500 nm NPs. Oriented immobilization through the Si tag of His-Si-PK (blue squares) and
Si-PK (red circles) results in comparable initial reaction rates, while His-PK lacking the SiO2
affinity tag reveals a slower activity rate most likely due to its non-specific adsorption to the
NPs.

measured for each combination with and without PEP, as indicated by the colored symbols. All
combinations included equivalent amounts of PK and Luc. Here, coupled efficiency was calculated using the analysis as used in Fig 5, calculated by subtracting the negative reaction (-PEP)
from positive reactions (+PEP) slopes (indicated by solid lines). B) Summary of data presented
in A, shows that having both PK and Luc on NPs (black) facilitates reaction rates compared to
other combinations. Each condition was tested in triplicates; data shown represents 3 individual experiments; AVG±STDEV.

showing the activity of Luc measured when immobilized on silica NPs (blue dots), or in solution (square) with various ATP concentrations. For these experiments, the luminescent signal
was normalized against LU at time point 0, and plotted as a function of time, demonstrating a
significantly slower decay time for Luc when tethered.

S4 Fig. Co-immobilization of PK and Luc on single NPs reduced reaction efficiency when
ADP was limiting. A) To investigate the effect of enzyme proximity on coupled activity more
directly, His-Si-PK and His-Si-Luc were immobilized on 500 nm silica NPs separately (black)
or together (red). Luminescence signal in the presence of 0.2, 2 or 6 mM ADP was normalized
to t (0 min) and plotted against time (all other conditions/substrates were kept the same). B)
Surprisingly, we found the activity of the coupled reactions to be significantly reduced when
the enzymes were co-tethered on single particles versus tethered on separate particles. There
are multiple possible explanations for this finding, ranging from steric hindrance between the
two proteins when co-tethered, to interference by Luc with PK tetramers, to a competition
between the enzymes for interaction with ADP [33, 34]. Such competition would reduce substrate availability for PK, resulting in overall reduced luminescence. To distinguish between
these possibilities, we repeated the experiment with increased concentrations of ADP, and
found that a 10-fold excess or more of ADP reversed the reduction in activity (middle and
right panels), suggesting that competition for ADP was largely responsible.
