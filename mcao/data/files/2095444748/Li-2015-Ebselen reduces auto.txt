a b s t r a c t
Previous studies have demonstrated that both oxidative stress and autophagy play important roles in
secondary neuronal degeneration in the ipsilateral thalamus after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). This study aimed to investigate whether oxidative stress is associated with autophagy activation within the ipsilateral thalamus after distal MCAO. Sixty stroke-prone renovascular hypertensive rats
were subjected to distal MCAO or sham operation, and were killed at 14 days after MCAO. Mn-SOD, LC3-II,
Beclin-1 and p62 expression were evaluated by immunostaining and immunoblotting. Secondary damage in the thalamus was assessed with Nissl staining and immunostaining. The association of oxidative
stress with autophagy activation was investigated by the antioxidant, ebselen. We found that treatment
with ebselen at 24 h after MCAO signiﬁcantly reduced the expression of Mn-SOD in the ipsilateral thalamus at 14 days following focal cerebral infarction. In parallel, it prevented the elevation of LC3-II and
Beclin-1, and the reduction of p62. Furthermore, ebselen attenuated the neuronal loss and gliosis in the
ipsilateral thalamus. These results suggested that ebselen reduced oxidative stress, autophagy activation and secondary damage in the ipsilateral thalamus following MCAO. There are associations between
oxidative stress, autophagy activation and secondary damage in the thalamus after MCAO.

1. Introduciton
Accumulating studies have demonstrated that focal cerebral
infarction in the territory of middle cerebral artery not only causes
ischemic damages at the primary focus, but also leads to secondary
neurodegeneration in the ipsilateral nonischemic thalamus, which

may delay the functional recovery after ischemia [1,2]. Different
explanations have been proposed for secondary neuronal damage
after focal cerebral infarction, including apoptosis, inﬂammation,
neurotoxins, axonal degeneration and oxidative DNA damage [3].
Autophagy is a process in which long-lived proteins and
organelles are delivered to the lysosomes for degradation, which
plays an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis [4]. During autophagy, autophagosomes or autophagic vacuoles, which are
double- or multi-membrane structures, are formed to sequester
cytoplasmic constituents, and then fuse with lysosomes to digest
the contents for recycling [5]. Autophagy plays multiple roles in

Y. Li et al. / Neuroscience Letters 600 (2015) 206–212

adaptation to nutrient deprivation, intracellular clearance, and
possibly cell death [6]. Recently, our studies have showed that
autophagy is induced and contributes to secondary neuronal damage in the ipsilateral thalamus after cerebral cortical infarction [7,8],
but the underlying mechanisms of autophagy activation have not
been fully investigated.
Increasing evidence suggests reactive oxygen species (ROS)
are important activators of autophagy [9–11]. Administration of
antioxidants can inhibit autophagy induction and attenuate the cellular injury after myocardial ischemia/reperfusion and traumatic
brain injury [12–14]. Notably, oxidative stress is also evident in the
ipsilateral thalamus damage following cerebral cortical infarction.
Our previous study has demonstrated that the immunoreactivity of 8-ohdG, one marker of oxidative DNA damage, is increased
in ipsilateral thalamus after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) [15]. Moreover, an increased immunoreactivity of
manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), a critical enzyme for
eliminating ROSs observed in the thalamus following focal ischemia
[16]. However, no studies have investigated the role of oxidative
stress in the autophagy activation of thalamus following cerebral
infarction.
The present study was conducted to investigate whether oxidative stress is associated with autophagy activation, and whether
administration of antioxidant ebselen can inhibit autophagy induction within the ipsilateral VPN after focal cerebral infarction.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animal model and groups
The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional
Animal Ethical Committee of Sun Yat-sen University, and all procedures involving animals were conducted according to institutional
guidelines. A total of 60 male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing
70–90 g were established as stroke-prone renovascular hypertensive rats (RHRSP) as described [17]. Approximately twelve
weeks later, 52 RHRSP with systolic blood pressure maintained at
>180 mmHg and without stroke and peritonitis symptoms were
assigned randomly to receive focal cortical infarction (n = 40) or
sham procedures (n = 12). Focal cortical infarction was achieved by
electrocoagulation of the distal middle cerebral artery as described
previously [18]. In brief, the rats were anesthetised with 10%
chloral hydrate (3 mL/kg, intraperitoneally). Under operating miscroscope, the right middle cerebral artery was exposed and then
was occluded distal to the origin of the striatal branches by
micro-bipolar electrocoagulation, which resulted in permanent
focal infarction in the neocortex. Sham-operated rats underwent
the same procedure, excluding MCAO. Body temperature was
maintained at 37 ± 0.5 ◦ C on a heating pad during the intra- and
postoperative periods. After recovery from anesthesia, they were
returned to the cages and had free access to food and water. Thirtysix rats with successful MCAO were randomly divided into three
groups: MCAO (n = 12), vehicle (n = 12), and ebselen (n = 12). The
remaining four rats were excluded from the study because of death
or subarachnoid haemorrhage.
2.2. Ebselen administration
Ebselen (Sigma, USA) or vehicle was given as described [15].
Brieﬂy, ebselen or vehicle was administered by gastric gavage once
a day for two weeks, starting 24 h after cerebral infarction. Ebselen
was dissolved in a mixed solvent consisting of 0.5% carboxymethyl
cellulose and 0.02% Tween-20 at a dose of 30 mg/kg per day. Vehicle animals were given 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose and 0.02%
Tween-20 (1 ml/kg/day).

207

2.3. Tissue preparation for histochemistry
At 14 days after MCAO, eight rats from each group were sacriﬁced under deep anesthesia with 10% chloral hydrate (4 mL/kg,
intraperitoneally). Then, the rats were perfused transcardially with
0.9% saline at 4 ◦ C, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate-buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4). After postﬁxation for 8 h at
4 ◦ C, the brains were sequentially immersed in 20% and 30% sucrose
until sinking occurred. Coronal sections (10-␮m thick) were cut on
a cryostat (CM1900; Leica, Heidelberger, Germany) from bregma
+4.7 to −5.2 mm.
2.4. Nissl staining
Nissl staining was performed with 0.1% cresyl violet (Sigma) following a standard procedure to detect neural damage and calculate
infarct volume. The volumes of the infarct and the contralateral
hemisphere were calculated as previously described [19]. Relative
infarct volume was presented as a percentage of the infarct to contralateral hemisphere.
2.5. Immunoﬂuorescent labeling
Frozen sections were pre-treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 for
30 min and then blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at
room temperature (RT). Thereafter, they were incubated at 4 ◦ C
overnight with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-MAP2 (neuronal marker, 1: 400; Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), mouse
anti-glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (astrocytic marker, 1:
1000; Millipore), mouse anti-microtubule-associated protein 1A
light chain 3 (LC3) (1: 400; MBL, Naka-Ku Nagoya, Japan), mouse
anti-MnSOD protein (1:400; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA),
rabbit anti-MnSOD protein (1:400; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-Beclin-1 protein (1:400; Abcam). Negative control sections
were incubated with 0.01 M PBS rather than primary antibody.
After rinsing in 0.01 M PBS, sections were then incubated at RT
for 1 h with secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG (1:300; Invitrogen, Irvine, CA, USA) and Dylight
549-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:300; Jackson Immunoresearch
Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA). Fluorescence signals were
detected with a microscope (BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
2.6. Immunoblotting
Four rats in each group were sacriﬁced at 14 days after MCAO.
After deep anesthesia as described above, the rats were perfused
transcardially with 0.9% saline at 4 ◦ C. The ipsilateral or contralateral thalamus was rapidly separated from the brain tissue and then
homogenized in cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics).
Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay
kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal amounts of protein
from each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membranes
(Millipore). The membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat milk at RT for
1 h. Next, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies at 4 ◦ C overnight: mouse anti-LC3 (1: 400; MBL), mouse
anti-MnSOD (1:5000; R&D Systems), rabbit anti-Beclin-1 (1:1000;
Abcam), mouse anti-p62 (1:1000; Abcam), and mouse anti-␤-actin
(1: 2000; Sigma). After rinsing in TBST, the membranes were then
incubated at RT for 1 h with the secondary antibodies: horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:1000; Cell Signaling
Technology) or goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoreactivity was visualised by enhanced
chemiluminescence method.

2.7. Image analysis and quantiﬁcation
Histological images analysis was conducted by one author
blind to the animals’ group assignment. Five consecutive sections at 2.0-mm intervals from bregma +4.7 to −5.2 mm were
analyzed for quantiﬁcation of infarct volume. Every 6th section
between −2.8 and −4.4 mm relative to bregma was selected for

quantitative analysis of Nissl staining and immunostaining in
the thalamus. The intact neurons and immunopositive cells were
counted using Image-Pro Plus image analysis software (Media
Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) in three non-overlapping
ﬁelds (425 ␮m × 320 ␮m) under ×400 magniﬁcation [7,8,15]. The
cell number was expressed as cells per ﬁeld on each section.

2.8. Statistical analysis
All data were presented as mean ± SEM and group comparisons were conducted by one-way analysis of variance followed by
Fisher’s least signiﬁcant difference test, except that immunoblotting data were expressed as median (quartile range) and compared
using Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Mann–Whitney U-test. All
data were analyzed with SPSS 13.0 for windows (SPSS Inc.,Chicago,
IL, USA). Difference was considered statistically signiﬁcant when
p < 0.05.

3.2. Ebselen reduced the ischemia-induced increase of MnSOD in
the ipsilateral thalamus after MCAO
Protein gel blot analysis demonstrated that MnSOD level was
remarkably increased in the ipsilateral thalamus at 14 days after
MCAO, when compared with the sham-operated rats and the contralateral thalamus (both p < 0.05, Fig. 1A and B). Treatment with
ebselen signiﬁcantly reduced MnSOD level in the ipsilateral thalamus compared with that in the vehicle group (p < 0.05, Fig. 1A
and B). Double immunostaining was performed to investigate the
expression pattern of MnSOD. It showed that most MnSOD-positive
cells were co-labelled with MAP-2, and none were co-labelled
with GFAP (Fig. 1C). Notably, MnSOD-positive cells were also colocalized with Beclin-1 and LC3, respectively (Fig. 2D).

3.3. Ebselen inhibited autophagy in the ipsilateral thalamus after
MCAO

On Nissl-stained slices, the cortical infarction was restricted to
the right somatosensory cortex in the MCAO-operated rats and
no infarction was observed in the sham-operated rats. The relative cortical infarct volumes were 13.82 ± 1.66%, 14.31 ± 1.84% and
14.01 ± 1.69% in the MCAO, vehicle and ebselen groups, respectively, at 14 days after MCAO. No signiﬁcant difference was noted
among the three groups (p > 0.05).

At 14 days after MCAO, the ratio of LC3-II/ LC3-I and Beclin-1
expression were signiﬁcantly elevated in the ipsilateral thalamus
(all p < 0.05, Fig. 2A–C and E). In contrast, p62 protein level was
reduced in the ipsilateral thalamus after MCAO (p < 0.05, Fig. 2A
and D). Treatment with ebselen prevented the elevation of LC3-II
and Beclin-1, and the reduction of p62 in the ipsilateral thalamus
(all p < 0.05, Fig. 2A–E).

3.4. Ebselen reduced secondary damage in the ipsilateral
thalamus after MCAO
Nissl staining showed numerous degenerative neurons with
shrunken cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei in the ipsilateral thalamus
of ischemic rats but not in the sham controls (Fig. 3A). The number
of intact neurons and MAP-2-positive cells were decreased remarkably within the ipsilateral thalamus in the three ischemia groups
compared with the sham-operated group (all p < 0.05, Fig. 3A–C).
Conversely, GFAP-positive cells within the ipsilateral thalamus
were increased in the MCAO, vehicle, and ebselen groups (all
p < 0.05, Fig. 3A and D).
Administration of ebselen signiﬁcantly increased the numbers
of intact neurons and MAP-2-positive cells within the ipsilateral
thalamus (both p < 0.05, Fig. 3A–C). Moreover, it reduced GFAPpositive cells (both p < 0.05, Fig. 3A and D).

4. Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the effects of antioxidant
ebselen on autophagy activation in the ipsilateral thalamus after
MCAO. We found that focal cortical infarction in the territory of
middle cerebral artery led to MnSOD elevation, autophagy activation and secondary damage in the ipsilateral thalamus. Moreover,
treatment with ebselen signiﬁcantly reduced MnSOD expression,
autophagy activation and secondary damage.
Our and others studies have shown that oxidative DNA damage
may be involved in the secondary thalamic damage after MCAO

[15,16,20]. Consistent with the previous observations, we found
that focal cerebral infarction led to an increased expression of
MnSOD in the ipsilateral thalamus. MnSOD is the major ROS detoxifying enzyme of cells. Its major function is to convert superoxide
produced in mitochondria into hydrogen peroxide [21]. Upregulation of MnSOD level suggests a response to increased superoxide
production and oxidative stress [22]. Therefore, the elevation of
MnSOD demonstrates that superoxide production is increased in
the thalamus. It has been shown that the protective effects of ebselen on cerebral ischemia are mediated through its antioxidative
actions [23]. Ebselen can reduce oxidative damage in the ipsilateral thalamus after MCAO [15]. In this study, we further showed
that administration of ebselen attenuated the elevation of MnSOD,
indicating ebselen reduce oxidative stress in the thalamus.
Recently, autophagy has been shown to be involved in the secondary thalamic damage following focal cerebral cortical infarction
[7,8]. Consistent with these previous observations, we found that
the ratio of LC3-II/ LC3-I were elevated in the ipsilateral thalamus
at 14 days after MCAO. LC3 is generally recognized as the biochemical marker of autophagosome. Upon induction of autophagy, LC3-I
converts to LC3-II, which then translocates to the membranes of
autophagosomes [8]. The increased ratio of LC3-II/ LC3-I in the ipsilateral thalamus after MCAO indicated that autophagosomes were
increased in the thalamic cells. To investigate whether autophagy
is activated, we further examined the expression of Beclin-1 and
p62. Beclin-1, a mammalian ortholog of yeast Atg6/Vps30, participates in autophagosome formation [5]. Overexpression of Beclin-1
leads to stimulation of autophagic ﬂux in neuronal cultures [24].

Y. Li et al. / Neuroscience Letters 600 (2015) 206–212

In contrast, decreased expression of Beclin-1 exhibits reduced
autophagic activity [25]. P62 is known to be sequestered and
degraded during autophagy [26]. The level of p62 is currently used
to monitor autophagic ﬂux [27]. We found that Beclin-1 expression
was increased and p62 level was reduced, suggesting autophagy
was activated in the ipsilateral thalamus following cerebral infarction.
The mechanism of autophagy activation in the ipsilateral thalamus following cerebral infarction is still unknown. Increasing
lines of evidence suggest oxidative stress plays an important
role in regulating autophagy in vivo and vitro [9–11]. Oxidative
stress has been demonstrated to contribute to autophagy activation during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion and traumatic brain
injury [12–14]. However, the role of oxidative stress in thalamic
autophagy activation following cerebral infarction has not been
investigated. In this study, we found that the immunoreactivity
of MnSOD was colocalized with Beclin-1 and LC3-positive cells,
suggesting Beclin-1 and LC3-positive cells may have increased
superoxide production and oxidative stress. Furthermore, administration of antioxidant ebselen attenuated the elevation of MnSOD.
In parallel, it prevented the elevation of LC3-II and Beclin-1, and
the reduction of p62. These ﬁndings suggested that oxidative stress
may be associated with autophagy activation in the ipsialteral thalamus following cerebral infarction.
In our previous study, ebselen has been demonstrated to reduce
delayed neuronal damage in the ipsilateral thalamus after MCAO
[15]. In this study, we further showed that ebselen reduced astrocytic proliferation in the thalamus. The protective effect of ebselen
may be mediated through the attenuation of oxidative stress and
autophagy activation. Taken together, ebselen is a prospective
drug to prevent secondary thalamic damage following cerebral
infarction. Nevertheless, it is still uncertain whether the protective
effect of ebselen is temporal or sustained. Thalamic degeneration
may continue over a longer post-stroke period. Future studies are
needed to investigate whether ebselen is effective at later time
points more than 14 days. Moreover, it would be also important
to examine the functional outcome after treatment with ebselen.
The thalamic pathology after MCAO is complex phenomenon
including in addition to axonal degeneration, inﬂammation, oxidative stress and autophagy, also atypical Amyloid-beta (A␤) and
calcium accumulation [3,7,8,15,28]. These pathological alterations
may interact with each other. For example, there is evidence for
a complex interaction between autophagy and A␤ accumulation.
Autophagy has been suggested to be an A␤ peptide-generating
pathway [29]. Inhibition of autophagy reduces thalamic A␤
deposits [8]. In addition, A␤ may be involved in the autophagy
induction. Reduction of A␤ deposits by ␥-secretase inhibitor suppressed autophagy activation [7]. Further studies are warranted to
understand the temporal sequence of the pathology as well as the
initial mechanism.
In summary, our study demonstrated that ebselen attenuated
oxidative stress, autophagy activation and secondary damage in the
ipsilateral thalamus following MCAO. The results suggest that there
are correlative associations between oxidative stress, autophagy
activation and secondary damage in the thalamus after MCAO.
