Abstract: Objective To investigate effects of KATP opener on the expressions of caspase-12 mRNA and protein, and to
explore the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway in the mechanism of KATP opener protecting against neuronal
apoptosis after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Methods Two hundred rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham
operation group, ischemia-reperfusion group, KATP opener group, and KATP blocker group. The middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was established by intraluminal suture occlusion method; neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL
staining. The mRNA and protein expressions of caspase-12 were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. Results In ischemia-reperfusion group, KATP opener group and KATP blocker group, the
number of apoptotic cells and the mRNA and protein expressions of caspase-12 gradually increased following cerebral
reperfusion, and reached the peak at 24 h. In KATP opener group, The number of apoptotic cells was significantly less than that
in ischemia-reperfusion group and KATP blocker group at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); while the mRNA and
protein levels of caspase-12 were significantly less than those in ischemia-reperfusion group and KATP blocker group at all
times (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). There were no differences between the ischemia-reperfusion group and KATP blocker group at each
time (P > 0.05). Conclusion KATP opener may protect neurons from apoptosis following the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion by
inhibiting ER stress pathway.

1 Introduction
Researches have shown that ATP sensitive potassium
channel (KATP) openers have neuroprotective effects against
cerebral reperfusion injury[1,2]. Our previous researches demonstrated that systemic administration of pinacidil may significantly decrease neuronal apoptosis following the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion by inhibiting both death receptor
and mitochondria signal pathways[3,4]. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis has recently been identiCorresponding author: Hong ZHANG

fied as an important signal pathway different from death receptor and mitochondria signal pathways. ER is an organelle
that plays an important role in folding and processing of
membrane proteins, and maintenance of intracellular calcium
homeostasis[5]. Recent evidences indicate that ER stress also
plays an important role in the process of cell apoptosis.
Caspase-12 is an ER-specific caspase. Disturbance of calcium homeostasis and accumulation of unfolded proteins in
ER may cause ER stress, which will activate caspase-12 and
subsequent caspases[6]. Therefore ER stress pathway is characterized by caspase-12 activation. In the present study, we
examined the effects of pinacidil, a KATP opener, on neuronal
apoptosis and the mRNA and protein expressions of caspase12 in rats after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, in order to explore the signaling transduction pathway of KATP opener.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Experimental animals and groups Two hundred male
Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g (provided by the laboratory
animal center of China Medical University) were randomly
assigned into four groups: sham operation group, ischemiareperfusion group, KATP opener treatment group (KATP opener
group), and KATP opener plus blocker treatment group (KATP
blocker group). In each group, the rats were separated into 5
subgroups according to the different time points after ischemia-reperfusion: 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h (n = 10 in
each subgroup). In each subgroup, five rats were used for
immunohistochemical staining, and the other five rats were
used for RT-PCR.
2.2 Animal models and drug administration The middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was performed as
previously described by Nagasawa[7]. In brief, the right common carotid artery (CCA) was exposed through a midline
incision on the neck and dissected free of surrounding nerves.
A 5-cm length of nylon filament (Diameter 0.26 mm) was inserted into the common carotid artery through a small incision proximal to the bifurcation and advanced in the internal
carotid artery to about 18 mm distal to the carotid bifurcation
until mild resistance was indicated. Reperfusion was accomplished by withdrawing the filament at 2 h after the MCAO.
The operation procedure of sham operation group was the
same as the other three groups except only that the nylon
filament was not ligated. Body temperature of rats was controlled at 37.0 oC with a heating lamp and rectal probe. In KATP
opener group, 10 PL of pinacidil (10 nmol / 5 PL) was administered intracerebroventricularly 30 min before induction of
cerebral ischemia. In KATP blocker group, 10 PL of the KATP
b l o c k e r g l i p i z i d e ( 1 P m o l / 5 P L )was injected
intracerebroventricularly 15 min prior to administration of
pinacidil, the rats in sham operation group and ischemiareperfusion group were only injected intracerebroventricularly
with the same volumes of 0.9% NaCl. At each time point, the
rats used for TUNEL and immunohistochemical staining were
anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (600 mg/kg) and perfused transcardially with cold saline followed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, then the brains were removed and fixed in
the same fixative solution for 2 h. Slices were embedded in
paraffin and cut into 6-Pm-thick coronal sections. The rats
for RT-PCR examination were decapitated quickly, then the

right superior one-third of cortical areas from the longitudinal cerebral fissure to lateral cerebral fissure, which was defined as penumbra area[8], were dissected and stored at -70 oC
until use.
2.3 Immunohistochemical staining The sections were
dropped with 3% H2O2 for 10 min at 37 oC, washed three times
in distilled water for 3 min each, then heated and boiled by
microwave. Nonspecific activity was blocked with protease
for 20 min. A rat polyclonal anti-caspase-12 antibody (1:160,
Chemicon Ltd. USA) was incubated with the brain section at
4 oC overnight, washed in PBS for three times (2 min each)
followed by incubated with the secondary antibody (biotinlabelled goat anti-rabbit IgG) at 37 oC for 40 min, and then
washed in PBS for three times (2 min each) again. Finally, the
sections were stained with DAB and counterstained with
hematoxylin for 15 min. Caspase-12 positive cells were labeled brown in the cytoplasm.
2.4 RT-PCR The primers were synthesized as follows:
caspase-12 (GenBank NM-130422), forward 5’-TCC TGG TCT
TTATGT CCC-3’, reverse 5’-CGATAG CCC AAG GAA GTG3’, with a 180-bp product; and the internal control E-actin:
forward 5’-CAC CCT GTG CTG CTC ACC GAG GCC-3’, reverse 5’-CCA CAC AGA TGA CTT GCG CTC AGG-3’, with a
690-bp product. The PCR reaction system (25 PL) contained
ddH2O 17.1 PL, cDNA fragment 3.0 PL, 10 × Buffer 2.5 PL,
dNTPs (2.5 mmol/L) 2 PL , Taq polymerase 0.2 PL, and primers for caspase-12 or E-actin 0.1 PL. PCR reaction parameters
were as follows: pre-degeneration at 94 oC for 10 min, degeneration at 94 oC for 40 s, annealing at 51.5 oC for 1 min, and
elongation at 72 oC for 1 min, for 32 cycles; and finally a
continual elongation at 72 oC for 7 min. The kit was supplied
by Dalian Bao Biological Technology Ltd., China.
2.5 Statistical analysis Under four unoverlapped visual
fields, the integral optical density (IOD) of caspase-12 protein was calculated by using MetaMorph image analysis
system. PCR products were detected by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed by 1D Kodak image analysis system.
The relative quantity of caspase-12 mRNA was estimated by
comparison of its absorbance ratio to that of E-actin’s. Data
were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with SPSS11.5 software
package and expressed as mean±SD. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

3 Results
3.1 Expressions of caspase-12 protein Caspase-12 protein
were mainly expressed in the ischemic penumbra. There were
no caspase-12 positive cells observed in sham operation
group. The caspase-12 protein level in the other three groups
was significantly higher than that in sham operation group
(P < 0.01). The caspase-12 level began to increase at 6 h after
the ischemia-reperfusion, gradually increased further after
that until reached peak at 24 h, and then decreased gradually.
The expression of caspase-12 protein in the KATP opener
group were significantly less than that in the ischemiareperfusion group and the KATP blocker group at each time
(P < 0.01, P < 0.05). There were no significant differences
between ischemia-reperfusion group and KATP blocker group

4 Discussion
KATP channels are composed of heteromultimers: four
inward rectifier potassium channel pore subuints (Kir6.X)
and four sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) that regulate channel activity. KATP channels are distributed widely in the central nervous system. KATP channel opener is a new neuroprotective drug, but its protective mechanism is still elusive.
Our previous studies showed that KATP channel opener significantly decreased the infarct volumes, improved neurological deficits, inhibited neuronal apoptosis, decreased the
expression of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 mRNAs and
proteins by regulating both death receptor and mitochondria signal pathways[3,4].

distribute widely in eukaryotic cells. It is an important organelle involved in folding and processing of proteins, lipids
metabolism, and calcium store[9]. The activation of caspase12 is a key factor in ER stress-induced apoptosis. Caspase12 in the ER is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme
procaspase-12, which converted into the active enzyme responding to ER stress. Active caspase-12 then activates
subsequent caspases such as caspase-9 and caspase-3, and
induced neuronal apoptosis[10]. By immunohistological
analysis, Shibata M et al.[11] demonstrated that caspase-12
was activated in neurons at 5-23 h after transient MCAO,
and caspase-12 immunoreactivity was co-localized with neuronal apoptosis. Mouw G et al.[12] reported that caspase-12
was also activated after permanent focal ischemia in rats. We
observed that the expressions of caspase-12 mRNA and protein were significantly elevated after cerebral ischemia by
immunohistological and RT-PCR analysis. The number of
caspase-12 positive cells began to increased at 6 h, increased
further after that until reached peak at 24 h, and then decreased gradually. This dynamic change was consistent with
neuronal apoptosis. The results indicated that ER stress
pathway took part in regulation of the neuronal apoptosis
following the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. After cerebral
ischemia-reperfusion, ER stress can be induced under several conditions like hypoxia, acidosis, ATP depletion, perturbation of intracellular calcium homeostasis, and excess free
radical production. The moderate stress on ER will trigger
many rescuer responses; on the other hand, excessive or
long-term exposure to ER stress will induce tissue damages.
Following disruption of the calcium homeostasis in ER, mcalpain is activated. Procaspase-12 is converted into active
enzyme following cleavage of activated m-calpain, and finally leads to activation of the downstream caspases[13]. ER
is also susceptible to oxidative stresses. Cerebral ischemiareperfusion injuries can trigger the generation of intracellular
reactive oxygen species, which will lead to ER oxidative damages[14].
Whether KATP opener has an effect on ER stress pathway was not reported before. Our study indicated that KATP
opener pinacidil could significantly reduce the expressions
of caspase-12 mRNA and protein following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. The protective effect of pinacidil could
be completely abolished by KATP blocker glipizide. This result
demonstrated that KATP opener protected neuronal cells

against neuronal apoptosis following the cerebral ischemiareperfusion by intervening ER stress pathway. The open of
KATP channel resulted in massive depolarization of the neuronal membrane, close of voltage-dependent calcium channel,
decrease of Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space and inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release from ER, therefore reduced
intracellular Ca2+ overload[15]. We proposed that KATP opener
could reduce the disturbance of calcium homeostasis in ER,
by which inhibit ER stress, down-regulate the expression of
caspase-12 mRNA and protein, and inhibit the neuronal
apoptosis after cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, there were
many genes and proteins involved in regulation of apoptosisassociated signal pathway. The different signal pathways
are not separated completely but cross into a complex
network. It is still uncertain if KATP opener directly activated
ER stress pathway or indirectly activated ER stress pathway
by activating other signal pathways.
The present study indicated that ER stress pathway may
take part in regulation of the neuronal apoptosis after cerebral ischemia. KATP opener had an important protective effect
against neuronal apoptosis following cerebral ischemiareperfusion by down-regulating the expressions of caspase12 mRNA and protein, and inhibiting the ER stress pathway.
ER plays a potential role in many physiological or pathological processes. Therefore, as an axis for signal reception, integration and transduction, ER will be a potentially therapeutic
target for ischemic stroke.
