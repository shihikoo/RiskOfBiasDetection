Abstract Progesterone (P) and 17ß-estradiol (E2) mitigate
neuronal damage after experimentally induced traumatic brain
injury (TBI) and ischemic stroke. Fish oil components such as
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA n3) also provide
neuroprotection in these traumatic models. Steroids and
PUFA n3 dampen neuroinflammatory processes and regulate
glial function in the affected brain areas. Using a transient
focal ischemic rat model, we demonstrate that the coapplication of PUFA n3 and P/E2 and the choice of the
application route have a clear impact on the prevention of
ischemia-induced infarct volume and behavioral recovery. A
combinatory PUFA n3 plus P/E2 emulsion intravenously
administered was most effective in reducing the infarct size
and in restoring behavioral reconstitution compared to other
oil emulsions and subcutaneous depot medication. These data
encourage to refining clinical treatment protocols for TBI and
stroke with gonadal steroids and to establishing combinatory
drugs of steroids and fish oil-enriched emulsions thereby
creating a win-win situation with two effective components.

Introduction
The permanent or transient occlusion of brain vessels is etiological for ischemic stroke. Acute hypoxia triggers a sequence of
pathophysiological processes beginning immediately after ischemia and continuing for hours and days. Primary neuronal damage mainly occurs within the first few hours and involves the
breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and rampant local
inflammatory involving brain-intrinsic (microglia, astroglia) and
invaded (T cells, neutrophils, macrophages) peripheral immune
cells (Iadecola and Anrather 2011; Lee et al. 2014). Inflammation
is typically accompanied by a disturbance of ion homeostasis,
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and impaired mitochondrial function, followed by edema formation which substantially contributes to brain damage (Dirnagel et al. 1999).
A series of studies within the past decade have shown that
gonadal steroids, i.e., progesterone (P) and 17ß-estradiol (E2),
exert profound and long-lasting neuroprotection under hypoxic conditions (Stein 2008; Suzuki et al. 2009; Dang et al.
2011; Ulbrich et al. 2012). Both steroids regulate a multitude
of physiological and pathophysiological events in the brain
including neuroinflammation. An intriguing question is
whether the important executors of brain-intrinsic immune
actions, i.e., microglia, are direct targets for E2 and P (Habib
and Beyer 2014). We have recently demonstrated that the
murine microglia-like cell line BV-2 and primary microglia
obtained from rodents express various classical and nonclassical E2 and P receptors under normoxia and hypoxia
conditions (Habib et al. 2014). Baker and colleagues (2004)
also reported that E2 regulates BV-2 cell function via estrogen
receptor-ß (ER-ß). The PR membrane component 1 (Pgrmc1),
a non-classical P mediator, is also expressed by microglia
in vitro (Bali et al. 2013; Habib et al. 2014). No detailed
information is available at present whether microglia in the
ischemic brain expresses ERs and PRs and to which extent. A
study from Tapia-Gonzalez et al. (2008) however provides

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 56:12–16

evidence that treatment with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) regulates levels of ER-α in vivo in cerebellar microglia. We
therefore assume that the anti-inflammatory potency of these
hormones and the modulation of microglial function are important to accomplish cell protection after stroke (Habib and
Beyer 2014; Barreto et al. 2014). A critical event in the
prevention of early stroke-induced tissue destruction appears
to be the control of the M1–M2 phenotype shift of local
activated microglia in the penumbra (Taylor and Sansing
2013). Using the above described cell culture models, we
were able to demonstrate that E2 and P applications favored
the neuroprotective M2 phenotype by inducing and reducing
the expression of selective M2 and M1 markers, respectively,
and restored phagocytosis activity of microglia (Habib et al.
2014; Habib and Beyer 2014). We currently examine microglia polarization in isolated microglia cells from the penumbra
of rats, but these data are too preliminary to be included here.
Similar to E2 and P, PUFA n3 either given as a dietary
therapy (Michael-Titus and Priestley 2014) or as acute supplementation (Belayev et al. 2009; Bazan 2011) also reveals
protective effects in TBI and stroke by attenuating ischemiarelated inflammatory overreaction and immune cell modulation. An important therapy-relevant subject is the dosage
form, application route, and composition to achieve rapid
and most effective protection. In the present study, we have
compared different carrier substances (NaCl-ethanol, sesame
oil, PUFA n3) and administration routes (subcutaneous neck
depot, sc; intravenously, iv) in their efficacy to reduce the
infarct area and improve behavioral outcome after transient
middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in rats.

Material and Methods
Experiments were performed with 12-week-old male Wistar
rats (Charles-River, Germany) according to the rules of “Care
of Animal Subjects” (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany).
Artery occlusion was induced under 2 % isoflurane anesthesia
by unilateral intraluminal tMCAO for 1 h as previously described in detail (Dang et al. 2011). Regional cerebral blood
(CBF) flow was continuously measured, and only animals
with a CBF reduction of >50 % compared to baseline before
tMCAO were included in the study. Occlusion was terminated
after 1 h and the animals kept for further 23 h under medical
monitoring. Behavioral experiments were performed prior to
sacrificing. Sham-operated animals underwent the same anesthesia and surgical procedures with the exception of tMCAO.
Rats received 1 and 12 h post-infarct iv (through a permanent
ipsilateral jugular vein catheter) 500 μl of 20 % oil-in-water iv
containing 200 g glycerides (oil) per L with 43 g/L
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 65 g/L eicosapentanaenoic acid
(EPA), and the remaining volume substituted with MCT medium
chain triglycerides (MCT). All emulsions were 20 % oil-in-water

13

emulsions. By applying two times 500 μL per rat (300 g) poststroke, each animal received a dosage of approx. 140 mg/day/kg
(DHA) and 220 mg/day/kg (EPA). The following PUFA n3 and

Analysis of all fatty acids in the plasma fraction was
commercially done by HPLC and mass spectrometry at
Lipidomix GmbH (Berlin, Germany, www.lipidomix.de) (for
details see Zendedel et al. 2014, under revision). Steroid levels
were analyzed by ELISA (for details see (Dang et al. 2011).
The other group received at the same time points sc depots
(500 μl) of sesame oil with or without hormones as above.
Neurobehavioral tests were performed 24 h after tMCAO as
described (Dang et al. 2011; Ryang et al. 2011a, b). Six selective
behavioral tests for motor and sensory dysfunction were carried
out (spontaneous activity, forepaw outstretching, climbing, stick
body perception, walking, vibrissae testing) giving a total of 18
points to be reached per individual. Sham animals persistently
scored 18 points. Tests were performed in a blinded way. The
experimenter who performed tMCAO numbered the animals.
Behavioral test were done by another person who was blind to
the experimental setting and treatment of the individual animal.
Data were calculated for each individually numbered animal, and
finally, blinding was unraveled by the two experimenters. Data
are shown as arithmetic means±SEM.
After behavioral testing, rats received an intra-peritoneal
injection of an overdose of pentobarbital (328 mg/kg).
Animals were transcardially perfused with physiological
NaCl and brains rapidly removed and cut into six consecutive
coronal sections (2 mm) which were stained in a 2 % 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Fluka, Germany) solution (15 min, 37 °C). The unstained (pale) infarcted area was
quantified using the open access morphometric software
ImageJ 1.41 (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Infarct volumes
were calculated separately for the cerebral cortex (Cx) and
basal ganglia (Bg). All six cross sections (see Fig. 1) were
individually measured, data summed, and multiplied by 2 mm
(thickness of the sections) (Ryang et al. 2011a, b). This yields
a total infarct volume covering more than 95 % of the totally

14

visible rostral-caudal extension of the infarct. Edema correction of infarct volume was performed as previously described
(Dang et al. 2011; Ryang et al. 2011a, b).
Values were analyzed for normal distribution using the
D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test putting all
values in one group. When the normality test was significant,
values were log-transformed and used for statistical analysis.
Intergroup differences were tested by one-way ANOVA
followed by Dunnett post-hoc test (multiple groups). All
statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 5
(GraphPad Software Inc.). Data are given as arithmetic
means±SEM. Numbers (n) or analyzed animals per group
are given in the figures.

Results and Discussion
Representative TTC images at the Bregma ±0.25 of the six
different treatment groups are shown in Fig. 1a. Note that the

necrotic lesions are typically restricted to the ipsilateral Cx and
the subcortical Bg. Six frontal to occipital-oriented TTCstained coronal sections (each 2 mm) were analyzed per group
to determine the extension of the infarct volumes in the Cx and
Bg (Fig. 1b, here a series of a tMCAO animal with NaClethanol iv substitution is presented). The calculated infarct
sizes in the NaCl-ethanol iv group was approx. 190 and
60 mm3 for the Cx and Bg, respectively. These volumes
correspond to previous studies, where we used a similar
approach for calculation of the infarct volume with all TTCstained slices (Ryang et al. 2011a, b). The comparison of the
present data with those from an earlier study is hindered, since
in the previous analysis, data were not collected and calculated
for all TTC-stained slices as here rather than per TTC-stained
slice at the same Bregma (Dang et al. 2011). Thus, total
volumes differ between both studies in terms of absolute
values. Nevertheless, the same tendency and magnitude of
steroid-mediated neuroprotection was obtained in both
studies.

agents principally tackle early inflammatory processes under
hypoxia and dampen thereby local immune overreaction, i.e.,
microglia activation, cytokine expression, and attraction of
peripheral immune cells, which is pivotal for pathogenesis of
ischemic stroke (Bazan 2011; Habib et al. 2014; Lee et al. 2014;
Zendedel et al. 2014). At present, we have no clear evidence for
a direct cross-talk of PUFA n3 and sex steroids in mediating
neuroprotection. PUFA n3 but not steroids have an assigned
function in modulating biophysical properties and integrity of
the plasma membrane, thus stabilizing intracellular ion balance
under ischemia (Mayurasakorn et al. 2011). The stereospecific
DHA-derived fatty acid neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) regulates
similar to E2 AKT translocation and signaling and NF-κB
activation (Ivanova et al. 2002; Niemoller and Bazan 2010;
Calder 2013). NPD1 shows a potent anti-inflammatory bioactivity (Bazan 2011). Thus, we assume that PUFA n3 transmit
individual protective effects but also show a synergistic function together with E2 and P on brain inflammatory responses
such as cytokine production and inflammasome activation as
we have recently demonstrated (manuscript under review).
To obtain sufficient and sustained neuroprotection in the
brain, iIt is mandatory to rapidly infuse these protective factors
and create rapid and high plasma concentrations during the
initial pathological processes. For P and E2, it has been
demonstrated that an early administration is essential for sufficient and enduring neuroprotection in stroke (Azcoitia et al.
1999; Cai et al. 2008). Our study now provides a combinatory
iv application of E2 and P dissolved in a systemically applicable oil emulsion containing DHA and EPA which allows to
rapidly rise plasma levels of neuroprotective DHA, EPA, E2,
and P within the first 15 min after onset of ischemia. Although
we demonstrate that other dosage forms, i.e., E2/P sc and iv
without PUFA n3, and PUFA n3 iv alone achieve a

All hormone-treated iv and sc groups, and the PUFA n3 iv
group presented a significant reduction of the infarct area in
the Cx compared to the NaCl-ethanol iv group.
Administration of PUFA n3 and E2/P iv resulted in the best
tissue protection compared to other hormone groups although
values nearly failed significance levels compared to the sesame oil plus E2/P. Behavioral analysis showed always a full
scoring of 18 points in sham-operated rats. Consistently with
the infarct reduction, we found improved behavioral scoring
in all hormone-treated iv and sc groups and the PUFA n3 iv
group. Likewise, PUFA n3 E2/P iv substitution crystallized as
the most effective cohort. Both measures, infarct protection
and behavioral recovery, were most effectively achieved
which is fortified by the highest significance rank of the
PUFA n3 E2/P iv group when compared to the control groups
(sesame oil sc or NaCl-ETOH iv) (Figs. 1 and 2).
Irrespective of the therapeutic strategy and medical treatment, timing of the therapy is the most important predictor for
the outcome of any medical intervention in ischemic stroke. It is
indisputable that the first 4–5 h of acute ischemia are important
to maximize functional recovery, although even at later stages,
restoration can be observed to some extent (Klein and
Engelhard 2010; Grotta 2012; Sohrabji et al. 2013). This narrow time window, mainly established for acute thrombolysis,
dictates the way a putative neuroprotective agent should be
administered. PUFA n3 and in particular DHA and EPA protect
from brain damage in diverse models of neuronal injury and in
particular in ischemic stroke (Bazan 2011; Belayev et al. 2009;
Zendedel et al. 2014). Comparably, E2 and P prevent infarct
damage in experimental ischemic animal models (Stein 2008;
Suzuki et al. 2009; Dang et al. 2011; Ulbrich et al. 2012). PUFA
n3 and gonadal steroids appear as multifaceted factors affecting
a wide array of pathophysiological processes. All of these
