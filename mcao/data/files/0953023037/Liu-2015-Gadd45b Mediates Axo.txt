Abstract Stroke causes devastating and irreversible losses of
neurological function with subsequent slow and incomplete
recovery of lost brain functions, because of the brain’s limited
capacity for brain plasticity. Growth arrest and DNA-damageinducible protein 45 beta (Gadd45b) has recently been demonstrated as a candidate plasticity-related gene, making it an
excellent candidate molecule that has therapeutic potential.
Here, we examine whether in vivo blockage of Gadd45b
affects axonal plasticity and subsequent functional recovery
after focal brain infarction. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats
were subjected to cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO). We adopted RNA interference (RNAi)
mediated by a lentiviral vector (LV) as a means of suppressing
the expression of Gadd45b. Functional recovery was assessed
with a battery of tests that measured skilled forelimb reaching
and forelimb balance controlling. Axonal reorganization at the
level of the red nucleus was revealed by anatomical studies.
Axonal regeneration was measured by elevated expression of
growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43). The levels of brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), cyclic AMP (cAMP),
protein kinase A (PKA), and Rho-kinase (ROCK) were determined. Gadd45b-RNAi significantly inhibited axonal plasticity (axonal regeneration and axonal reorganization) after
MCAO. This inhibition was paralleled by worse functional
recovery performance on several behavioral measures.
Gadd45b-RNAi also significantly decreased the expression
levels of both BDNF and cAMP/PKA/phosphorylated cAMP
response element-binding protein (pCREB) pathway and promoted ROCK expression. We conclude that Gadd45b stimulates recovery after stroke by enhancing axonal plasticity

Introduction
Stroke produces significant neurological deficits and adult
disability because the brain has a very limited capacity for
anatomical reorganization. There is presently no approved
drug-based therapy that would help to restore such lost functions in stroke patients [1]. After ischemic stroke, partial
recovery of function frequently occurs and may depend on
the plasticity of axonal connections. A limited degree of brain
axonal regeneration is thought to occur spontaneously in the
brain after stroke [2–5]. So, an alternative approach to improve outcome might be to augment the brain plasticity to
reorganize itself after injury.
Several recent studies have identified growth arrest and
DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 beta (Gadd45b) as a

1246

candidate gene involved in brain plasticity [6, 7] and axonal
processes [8]. A recent study suggests that Gadd45b can be
transiently induced by neuronal activity and may promote
long-lasting changes in neural plasticity in adult hippocampus.
Gadd45b promotes epigenetic DNA demethylation of brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neurons [6]. BDNF is
a neurotrophin that has been implicated in neurogenesis and
neural plasticity [9–12] and has been shown to improve functional recovery from brain ischemia [13, 14]. It is present in
high amount in neurons and increases in ischemic brain. In
vivo, BDNF could rescue neuronal cells from neurodegeneration resulted by ischemic injuries [15, 16].
In this study, we therefore examined the effects of Gadd45b
downregulation by RNAi on BDNF signaling, axonal plasticity, and functional recovery after experimental ischemic
stroke in rats.

Materials and Methods
Animals
All of these studies were performed using male SpragueDawley (SD) rats, aged 7–8 weeks old, weighing 200–
300 g, which were obtained from the Experimental Animal
Center of Chongqing Medical University. Rats were grouphoused (five animals per cage) in a quiet room maintained at
21–22 °C on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle and allowed free
access to food and water during this study. The experiment
was authorized by the Laboratory Animal Management Committee of Chongqing Medical University. All animal procedures were carried out strictly according to the rules of the
International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research
Involving Animals of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences.
A total of 259 rats were included in the study. Data are
reported on 154 animals. One hundred and five animals were
excluded from the study due to no neurologic abnormalities (20)
or death (85). The rats were randomly assigned to four groups:
sham, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (ischemia),
lentiviral vector (LV)-control (ischemia plus LV-control), and
LV-shGadd45b (ischemia plus LV-shGadd45b).
LVs and shRNA Injection
LVs pLKD.UBC.GFP.U6. small hairpin RNA (shRNA) were
generated. The sequence of this prepared rat Gadd45b siRNA
was 5-CGACAACGCGGUUCAGAAGUU-3 (sense) and 5PCUUCUGAACCGCGUUGUCGUU-3 (antisense). Seven
days before MCAO, 4 μl of concentrated viral solution was
stereotaxically delivered into the ipsilateral lateral ventricle
(coordinates from bregma AP-1.1 mm, ML-0.8 mm, DV4.2 mm from the pial surface) using a micropump injector at

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1245–1256

a flow rate of 0.2 μl/min. The needle was left in place for an
additional 5 min and then gently withdrawn. The control rats
were also injected with the same dose of lentivirus without
Gadd45b-shRNA.
Transient MCAO in Rats
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by a
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as previously described [17]. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (3.5 %
induction and 1.5 % maintenance in 70:30 N2O/O2) and body
temperature maintained at 37 °C using a heating pad during
the surgery. Briefly, the right common carotid artery (CCA),
the right external carotid artery (ECA), and the internal carotid
artery (ICA) were surgically exposed via a midline incision.
The CCA was ligated distally, and the ECA was ligated
proximally to the bifurcation of the ICA and the ECA. A
nylon filament (diameter 0.24–0.28 mm) was gently advanced
from the ECA into the lumen of the ICA. After 2 h of
ischemia, reperfusion was established by withdrawal of the
filament. The criterion for a successful model was the paralysis of the left limb when the rat has gained consciousness
postsurgery. Rats that failed to neurological deficits immediately after reperfusion (neurological score <1) were excluded
from the study. Sham-operated animals underwent the same
surgical procedures without occlusion of the CCA. A laser
Doppler flow meter (Periflux system 5000; Perimed) was used
to confirm the decrease of the middle cerebral artery blood flow
immediately after the occlusion to about 20 % of the basic
cerebral blood flow.
RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR
Animals were anesthetized (isoflurane 3.5 %) at 2 days (n=6/
group) and 14 days (n=6/group) after MCAO. Total RNA
from ipsilateral ischemic penumbra was harvested for the
assay of BDNF, growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43), and
Rho-kinase (ROCK) messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. The
procedure was similar to that in our previous study [18]. The
primer sequences were designed as follows: BDNF, forward
primer (5′-TGT CCG AGG TGG TAG TAC TTC ATC-3′)
and reverse primer (5′-CAT GCA ACC GAA GTA TGA AAT
AAC C-3′); GAP-43, forward primer (5′-ACG GAG ACT
GCA GAA AGCA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-CGG GCA CTT
TCC TTA GGT TT-3′); ROCK, forward primer (5′-CTG CTG
AAG TCG TGC TTG CA-3′) and reverse primer (5′-AGC
ATG TTA TCG GGC TTC ACA-3′); and β-actin, forward
primer (5′-CGT TGA CAT CCG TAA AGA CCT C-3′) and
reverse primer (5′-TAG GAG CCA GGG CAG TAA TCT-3′).
The real-time PCR protocol was obtained with the following
procedures: 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for
10 s, and 60 °C for 30 s. Cycle threshold value (Ct value) was
acquired from the software provided by the manufacturer. For

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1245–1256

each sample, a relative quantity was calculated using the
2-ΔΔCT method [19].

Immunohistochemistry
Animals were anesthetized (isoflurane 3.5 %) at 2 days (n=6/
group) and 14 days (n=6/group) after MCAO and fixed
through the left ventricle with ice-cold 0.9 % saline followed
by 4 % paraformaldehyde. When sufficiently perfused, the
brains were removed and put into 4 % paraformaldehyde for
24 h. Ten-micrometer-thick serial sections embedded in
paraffin were prepared for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated,
and submitted to microwave antigen retrieval in citrate
buffer (pH 6.0). The endogenous peroxidase activity was
blocked with 3 % H2O2 for 15 min, and sections were
blocked with normal goat serum for 20 min. Then, the
sections were incubated with rabbit polyclonal BDNF
(1:200, Santa Cruz), rabbit polyclonal phospho-CREB
(1:800, Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit polyclonal
PKA (1:600, Abcam Technology) antibodies overnight at
4 °C, followed by incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG for
30 min. Positive activity was revealed with diaminobenzidine
(DAB). Immunopositive cells were quantified by digital
thresholding of images using NIH ImageJ. Immunopositive
cells were quantified by individual counts in a 1-mm2
field at bregma 1.7 mm in five animals selected randomly from each group. As stereological methods were
not used, these numbers are from profile counts and
represent cell densities at this level only. To insure that
between-group differences were not caused by changes in the
diameter of these profiles, we measured the cross-sectional
areas of stained profiles in 20 consecutive objects in four
sections/case.

Immunofluorescence Staining
Expression of GAP-43 in the brain tissue was assessed by
immunofluorescence staining. The brain tissue blocks were
prepared as frozen sections (10-μm thick). Briefly, frozen
sections were incubated for 15 min in 1 % Triton X-100 to
disrupt the cell membrane after being air-dried. Sections were
then placed in PBS and blocked with normal goat serum at
37 °C for 30 min. Sections were incubated in mouse antiGAP-43 (1:500, #MAB347, Millipore) overnight at 4 °C,
followed by reaction for 1 h at 37 °C with FITC-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200). After washing, the
sections were cover-slipped with glycerin jelly. Images were
captured and digitized using a Leica laser scanning confocal
microscope (Leica TCS-SP2). GAP-43-positive cells were
quantified using the same method to immunohistochemistry.

Western Blot Analysis
Animals were anesthetized (isoflurane 3.5 %) at 2 days (n=6/
group) and 14 days (n=6/group) after MCAO. Ipsilateral
ischemic penumbra was harvested for the assay of BDNF,
GAP-43, pCREB, and ROCK protein levels. Western blotting
was performed as described previously [18]. The following
primary antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal antibody
against BDNF (Santa Cruz, USA), phospho-CREB (Cell Signaling Technology, USA), CREB (Cell Signaling Technology,
USA), ROCK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, USA),
and mouse monoclonal antibody against GAP-43 (#MAB347,
Millipore). Subsequently, the membrane was washed and
incubated with secondary antibody. Blots were then subjected to gel formatter (Bio-Rad) and quantified through
Quantity One analysis. GAPDH was used as an internal
loading control.
Axon Tracing with BDA
Four weeks after MCAO, rats were anesthetized with
isoflurane (3.5 % induction and 1.5 % maintenance in 70:30
N2O/O2) and placed in a stereotaxic instrument. A craniotomy
was made to expose the sensorimotor cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the stroke lesion. Using a Hamilton
microsyringe, 15 μl biotin dextran amine (BDA) (MW
10,000; 10 % in PBS; Molecular Probes) was injected at five
sites at a depth of 1.5 mm from the cortical surface in the
uninjured caudal forelimb motor cortex as previously studied
[20]. These five coordinates were the following: 1.0 mm
rostral to the bregma, 1.0 mm lateral to the midline; 4.0 mm
caudal to the bregma, 1.0 mm lateral to the midline; 1.0 mm
rostral to the bregma, 5.0 mm lateral to the midline; 4.0 mm
caudal to the bregma, 5.0 mm lateral to the midline;
and 1.5 mm caudal to the bregma, 2.5 mm lateral to the
midline.
Two weeks after BDA injection, rats were overdosed
with 3.5 % chloral hydrate and transcardially perfused
with saline followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde. Brains
were removed, postfixed overnight in 4 % paraformaldehyde, and cryoprotected in 30 % sucrose. Tissue was cut
on a cryostat (Leica CM3050S, Germany) in serial 40-μm
coronal sections and reacted for BDA-positive fibers by
the free-floating method. All sections were collected in
PBS. Free-floating sections were incubated sequentially
in 0.1 % H2O2 (10 min), 0.5 % Triton X-100 (30 min),
avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Molecular Probes; 4 h),
and DAB (Molecular Probes; 5 min).
Sections were mounted, air-dried, dehydrated, and coverslipped. Sections were examined first using a ×10 objective,
and the midline was identified by using the central canal and
dorsal median fissure as anatomical landmarks. For each case,
we counted individual axons under ×400 magnification in

1248

several sections that showed a high density of reinnervation
and obtained an average from the four sections with the
greatest number of crossed axons. The fibers projecting to
the right red nucleus were examined by counting all BDApositive fibers crossing the midline on each section. To account for differences in tracing, the number of midlinecrossing BDA-positive fibers was divided by the total number
of CRT fibers. The BDA-labeled axons on sections were
counted using ImageJ software.
Behavioral Testing
Animals were tested 3 days before cerebral ischemia in order
to habituate them to the procedure and to be able to record
their optimal performance (baseline performance). Subsequently, behavioral tests were performed at days 2 and 14
post injury by a blinded investigator.
Neurological evaluations were carried out according to a
neurological grading score [21], from 0, no observable neurological deficit, to 4, unable to walk spontaneously and a
depressed level of consciousness.
Staircase test was applied to assess skilled forepaw use
[22]. Rats were food-deprived to 90 % of free-feeding weight
during training and placed in the staircase apparatus (length,
300 mm; width, 68 mm; height, 120 mm). In brief, each stair
was baited with three sucrose pellets (three 45-mg pellets per
step; BioServ, Frenchtown, NJ) on each of the seven stairs
descending on each side. Staircases were positioned, so left
forepaw could only retrieve pellets on the right stairs, and right
forepaw retrieve pellets on the left stairs. Further, rats could
not retrieve pellets from the bottom of the apparatus once they
had been displaced from the stairs. Baseline (prestroke) forepaw reaching performance was determined from the last two
trials. Rats must fast for 12 h and drink freely before every test.
Montoya staircase test score is the number of food pellets
obtained on the left side of the stairs and eaten by rats in 1-h
observation.
Beam balance test was applied to evaluate the motor coordination and balance control of the forelimbs and hindlimbs in
the rats after ischemia [23]. Beam balance performance of
animals was assessed on a 6-point scale [24]: 0=balancing
with steady posture; 1=grasping side of beam; 2=hugging
beam and 1 limb, falling down from beam; 3=hugging beam
and 2 limbs, falling down from beam, or spinning on beam
>60 s; 4=attempting to balance on beam but falling down
>40 s; 5=attempting to balance on beam but falling off >20 s;
and 6=falling off, no attempting to balance or hang onto
beam <20 s.
ELISA
Animals were anesthetized (isoflurane 3.5 %) at 2 days (n=6/
group) and 14 days (n=6/group) after MCAO. Ipsilateral

ischemic penumbra was harvested for the assay of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) protein
levels. The concentrations of cAMP and PKA in rat
brain homogenates were measured using specific ELISA
kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Hushang,
Shanghai, China).
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as the means±SD. The comparisons
of anatomical, morphological, and biological data between
groups were compared by using Student’s t tests (for
comparison between two groups) or one-way ANOVA
(for comparison of three or more groups). For behavioral
testing, data (minimum n=10/group) were analyzed using a
two-way ANOVA (repeat measures) with Bonferroni’s posttest to compare data sets. A value of P<0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
Gadd45b-RNAi Inhibits Axonal Regeneration and Axonal
Reorganization
Axonal regeneration was measured by upregulation of GAP43. We investigated GAP-43 mRNA and protein levels at 2
and 14 days after MCAO. The brain GAP-43 levels are shown
in Fig. 1. In the ipsilateral ischemic penumbra, immunofluorescence staining showed that GAP-43-positive cells increased (P<0.01, Fig. 1a, b) in MCAO and LV-control group
at 2 and 14 days after MCAO. Gadd45b-RNAi treatment
significantly decreased GAP-43-positive cells compared to
MCAO and LV-control group (P<0.01) at both time points.
The GAP-43 mRNA (P<0.01, Fig. 1c) and protein levels
(P<0.01, Fig. 1d) in the ipsilateral ischemic penumbra, determined by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, reflected
our immunohistochemical results in the same region in
each group.
To prove convincingly axonal reorganization after stroke,
corticorubral tracts were examined with the anterograde neuroanatomical tracer, BDA. Axons originating in the intact
hemisphere were labeled by injecting BDA into the left sensorimotor cortex at 4 weeks after ischemia. Rats were prepared for histology after allowing an additional 2 weeks for
the BDA to be transported to distal axonal terminals. Midline
crossings of the corticorubral tract were quantified by
counting BDA-positive fibers in the denervated red nucleus.
In all groups, red nucleus on the BDA-injection side showed
more dense BDA-positive fibers than on the contralateral side
as expected. The number of crossed corticorubral fibers was
low in sham-operated animals and increased significantly after

baseline testing before stroke, all animals achieved the same
score with no significant difference between groups (P>0.05)
in the beam-balance task (Fig. 2c) and staircase task (Fig. 2d).
All groups exhibited substantial motor function impairments
in the staircase task and beam-balance task after ischemia.
Gadd45b shRNA treatment significantly decreased walking
balancing (beam task, Fig. 2c, P<0.05) and forepaw skilled

Effects of Gadd45b-RNAi on BDNF Expression in Cerebral
Ischemia of Rats
We investigated BDNF mRNA and protein levels at 2 and
14 days after focal cerebral ischemia. The brain BDNF
levels are shown in Fig. 3. In the ipsilateral ischemic
penumbra, immunohistochemical studies showed that the
expression of BDNF (P<0.01, Fig. 3a, b) was increased
in rats in the MCAO and LV-control groups at 2 and
14 days after MCAO. BDNF was decreased in rats

BDNF was consisted with the protein levels in each group
(P<0.01, Fig. 3c).

Effect of Gadd45b-RNAi on cAMP/PKA/pCREB Pathway
To verify that whether there was a causal link between
Gadd45b and cAMP/PKA/pCREB pathway, we examined
the interaction of these molecules. In this study, we first
examined the effects of Gadd45b-RNAi on cAMP and

Then, we examined the effects of Gadd45b-RNAi on
pCREB protein expression using immunohistochemistry and
Western blotting at 2 and 14 days after cerebral ischemia in
rats. As shown in Fig. 5, Gadd45b-RNAi treatment significantly decreased pCREB immunological activities (Fig. 5a, b)

groups after cerebral ischemia (P<0.01). Gadd45b knockdown significantly increased ROCK levels compared to
MCAO and LV-control groups at 2 and 14 days after cerebral
ischemia (P<0.05).

Effect of Gadd45b-RNAi on ROCK
ROCK is pivotal in the control of axon outgrowth and its
inhibition. To verify whether Gadd45b induces axon regeneration through inhibiting ROCK expression, we examined the
interaction of these molecules. As shown in Fig. 6, the mRNA
(Fig. 6b) and protein level of ROCK (Fig. 6a) significantly

These studies show that Gadd45b-RNAi significantly inhibits
axonal plasticity in the rat brain and limits functional recovery
after ischemic stroke. Our studies have firstly revealed that
Gadd45b is a promising molecule that induces axonal plasticity
after ischemic stroke. Studies on enhancing the neural repair
function of Gadd45b may provide effective therapeutic strategies for promoting functional recovery after stroke.

Spontaneous improvement of function occurs in stroke
survivors and, more recently, has been linked to axonal plasticity, including axonal reorganization and axonal regeneration [25–27]. Axonal regeneration can be identified by the
elevated expression of growth-associated protein GAP-43.
GAP-43 is a membrane-bound protein found in the axonal
growth cones of sprouting CNS axons and has been implicated in the mechanism of axon regeneration. Acute increase of
GAP-43 levels is found after cerebral ischemia in rats [28]. In
present study, we used focal cerebral ischemia model and
focused on corticorubral pathway, originating from uninjured
sensorimotor cortex. Enhanced midline-crossing axons that
sprouted from intact corticorubral tract have shown to be
highly correlated with functional recovery following MCAO
[29, 30]. As demonstrated in this study, Gadd45b-RNAi

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1245–1256

significantly inhibited axonal regeneration, axonal reorganization, and functional recovery after cerebral ischemia.
Previous studies have clearly showed that increasing
BDNF levels or activating BDNF-associated signaling pathways leads to better functional recovery after stroke [31–34].
Recent studies found that increasing BDNF levels improves
synaptic plasticity and axon growth in the ischemic brain,
which enhance neurological functional recovery after stroke
in rats [35, 36]. BDNF injection has been reported to stimulate
GAP-43 expression and consequently axon regeneration in a
model of cervical axotomy [37]. A recent study using GAP-43
knockout animals directly showed that GAP-43 is necessary
to the neurotrophic effects [38]. GAP-43 was also identified as
a common mediator of the plastic regeneration effect of
BDNF [39]. The environment of the adult brain prevents
axonal regeneration after ischemic injury. This inhibition of
axon regeneration can be blocked by elevating cyclic AMP
(cAMP). cAMP is an integral downstream component of the
neurotrophin signaling pathway in axon regeneration [40],
and this regenerative effect is dependent on the activity of
PKA. BDNF was showed to activate cAMP/PKA pathway to
block inhibition of neurite outgrowth in a recent study [41].
This inhibition of axonal regeneration can be blocked by
elevating cAMP. The cAMP pathway can be activated via
pretreatment with neurotrophins and requires activation of
several signaling pathways which converge at activation of
cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) [42].
cAMP-dependent activation of PKA suppresses the Rho/
ROCK pathway [43, 44], which is known to be responsible
for the failure of axonal regeneration in the CNS. ROCK
inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance recovery after ischemic stroke. As demonstrated in the present
study, Gadd45b downregulation decreased axonal plasticity
and motor function recovery as caused by increased levels of
ROCK and decreased levels of cAMP, PKA, and pCREB.
Moreover, downregulation of Gadd45b decreased BDNF
levels. Gadd45b may regulate axonal plasticity through
BDNF pathway in ischemic brain damage.
The growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45
beta (Gadd45) is a family consisting of Gadd45a, Gadd45b,
and Gadd45g. Gadd45 has been implicated to act as stressresponse genes to physiological or environmental conditions
and classically is induced by genotoxic agents [45]. Previous
studies found that Gadd45 mRNA and protein are induced
following experimental ischemia or seizures [46, 47]. Our
previous study showed significant Gadd45b mRNA and protein by ischemia/reperfusion [18]. Gadd45b mRNA and protein also increase in patients with psychosis, and there is less
Gadd45b binding to the BDNF IXabcd promoter in psychotic
subjects [48]. Gadd45b promotes DNA demethylation of regulatory regions of BDNF IX, and Gadd45b KO mice showed
decreased BDNF gene expression [6]. Neurons lacking
Gadd45b fail to demethylate DNA and thereby fail to activate

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:1245–1256

BDNF. In this study, decreased BDNF levels may be
related to the decreased demethylation of BDNF by
Gadd45b downregulation.
In summary, this study shows that Gadd45b is a critical
mediator of cerebral ischemia-induced axonal plasticity, and
our findings suggest that strategies targeting Gadd45b could
be used to enhance function recovery following cerebral
ischemic injury.
