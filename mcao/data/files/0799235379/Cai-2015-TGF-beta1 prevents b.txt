Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) is well known to promote extracellular matrix accumulation. Recent
studies demonstrated that TGF-β1 protects against blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption in the condition of inﬂammatory pain and stroke. In the present study, we investigated whether TGF-β1 can maintain BBB integrity
and prevent hemorrhagic transformation (HT) after recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment
in a rat model of thromboembolic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Three hours after MCAO, rats were
given saline, rt-PA alone or rt-PA combined with TGF-β1 intravenously. Animals were sacriﬁced 24 h after surgery. HT was calculated as hemorrhagic score. Evans blue dye extravasation was measured for BBB disruption.
Basement membrane damage was observed by electron microscopy and quantiﬁed by collagen IV and laminin
immunostaining. Gelatin zymography was used to measure the activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP-9. Western blot was performed for the expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9 and plasminogen activator
inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). Rats treated with rt-PA showed elevations in basement membrane damage, BBB disruption and HT. These phenomena were reduced in rats treated by TGF-β1. We also showed that TGF-β1 inhibited rtPA mediated induction of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Meanwhile, TGF-β1 upregulated PAI-1 expression which was
reduced by rt-PA. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-β1 can reduce rt-PA induced basement membrane degradation, BBB disruption and HT. One possible mechanism is associated with the elevation of PAI-1.
Suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 elevated by rt-PA may be another mechanism contributing to the protective
effects of TGF-β1.

Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of
disability worldwide. The best treatment for acute ischemic stroke is
early cerebral artery recanalization with intravenous recombinant
tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). However, rt-PA induced hemorrhagic transformation (HT) may cause rapid and severe neurologic deterioration, limiting the clinical use of thrombolytic therapy (Wang
et al., 2004; Rosell et al., 2008). Although the mechanisms underlying
t-PA induced hemorrhage are still unclear, it has been demonstrated

as a result of extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and blood–brain
barrier (BBB) disruption (Adibhatla and Hatcher, 2008; Wang et al.,
2004; Wang and Shuaib, 2007; Yamashita et al., 2009). Therefore, ﬁnding an agent that protects the ECM and BBB can help reduce the HT associated with rt-PA.
Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) is a pleiotropic cytokine, which plays an important role in production and reconstruction
of ECM (Klass et al., 2009). It also has an inhibitory effect on the expressions of matrix-degrading proteinases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in many cell types (Vaday et al., 2001; Ogawa et al.,
2004; Hu et al., 2007). In addition, TGF-β1 stimulates the expression
of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), which suppresses ﬁbrinolysis by rapid complexing with t-PA (Vivien and Ali, 2006;
Abdullah et al., 2009). In the condition of inﬂammatory pain, exogenous
TGF-β1 can protect the integrity of BBB (Ronaldson et al., 2009). After
stroke, TGF-β1 has a role in wound contraction and re-epithelization
(Buga et al., 2012). Injection of TGF-β1 reduced secondary infarct bleeding in monocyte/macrophage-depleted mice (Gliem et al., 2012). In the
present study, we propose to further explore whether TGF-β1 has a potential to protect against BBB disruption and HT caused by rt-PA in a rat
model of thromboembolic stroke.

Material and methods
Animal model
Animal handling and surgical procedures were conducted according
to the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of

121

Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80-23, revised 1996), approved by the Research Animal Care Committee of Nanjing Medical University. Every effort was made to minimize pain. Adult male Sprague–
Dawley rats (Experimental Animal Center of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province, China) weighing 300–350 g were anesthetized
with 10% chloride hydrate (350 mg/kg, ip). Femoral arteries were cannulated to monitor pressure, pH and gases, and to draw blood samples.
Blood was mixed with thrombin (100 U/ml, Sigma, USA) and transferred into a PE 50 tubing. Forty minutes later, the ﬁbrin-rich segments
were selected and cut into small fragments of 0.35 mm in diameter and
1.5–2.0 mm long. A PE 50 tubing containing 10 thrombi was inserted
through the right external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery.
Then, the thrombi were slowly injected to occlude the middle
cerebral artery. Body temperature was kept constant at 37 °C with a
temperature-controlled heating pad during surgery. Sham-operated
rats underwent the same procedures except the injection of thrombi.
First, 97 animals were randomly assigned to 4 groups. Finally, 78 rats
were used after excluding the dead and no function impaired animals.

exchanged through propylene oxide, and embedded in a mixture of
epon, dodecenyl succinic anhydride and dibutyl phthalate for 48 h at
55 °C. Ultrathin sections were obtained, doubly stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then examined in a TEM (JEOL-1011, JEOL,
Tokyo, Japan) at 80 kV.

Group sham (n = 13/13) received sham surgery. Group control (n =
23/28) underwent thromboembolic middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) and received intravenous saline 3 h after surgery. Group rtPA (n = 21/28) underwent thromboembolic MCAO and intravenous
rt-PA 3 h after infarction. Group rt-PA + TGF-β1 (n = 21/28)
underwent thromboembolic MCAO and received intravenous TGF-β1
simultaneously with rt-PA 3 h after MCAO. Rt-PA (Boehringer
Ingelheim, Germany) was given at 10 mg/kg with a 10% bolus and
90% continuous infusion for 30 min. TGF-β1 (PeproTech, UK) was
given at 2.5 μg per animal over 5 min. All rats were sacriﬁced at 24 h
after MCAO.
Hemorrhage score
According to the deﬁnitions published by Garcia-Yebenes et al.
(2011), hemorrhagic events were classiﬁed as hemorrhagic infarction
(HI) types I and II and parenchymal hemorrhage (PH) types I and II.
The HT was scored as follows: 0 = no blood; 1 = HI I, small petechiae
along the margins of the infarct; 2 = HI II, more conﬂuent petechiae
within the infarcted area, but without space-occupying effect; 3 = PH
I, blood clot not exceeding 30% of the infarcted area with some mild
space-occupying effect; and 4 = PH II, dense blood clot(s) exceeding
30% of the infarct volume with signiﬁcant space-occupying effect. The
testing was performed by a coworker who was blinded to the earlier
treatment regimen.
Evaluation of BBB permeability
Evans blue (EB) dye (2%, 40 mg/kg, Sigma, USA) was administered
intravenously 2 h before harvesting the brain. After perfusion with saline, the ischemic hemisphere was put into 3 ml formamide at room
temperature for 48 h in the dark. Supernatants were collected following
centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 min. EB content was determined on
spectrophotometer (Epoch™&Take3™, Biotek, USA) at 620 nm and calculated from a standard curve of EB.

Coronal sections from the ischemic area were used. Four-micron
thick sections of parafﬁn-embedded tissues were deparafﬁnized with
xylene, rehydrated through graded alcohol series, and treated with 3%
H2O2 for 10 min. After rinsing with PBS, specimens were blocked with
10% normal goat serum, incubated with anti-collagen IV (1:500,
Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) or anti-laminin antibody (1:25, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA) at 4 °C overnight. After rinsing, biotinylated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was applied, followed
by incubation with a preformed complex of avidin and biotinylated peroxidase. For visualization, diaminobenzidine was used. Then, all sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Images were captured
using a CCD camera system (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed with
Imagepro-plus software. For each animal, the integrated optical density
per unit area (μm2) of Collagen IV and laminin was measured in 3
sections (− 2.8, −3.0, and − 3.2 mm from bregma). For each section,
5 different ﬁelds were randomly selected at ×400 magniﬁcation.
Preparation of tissue homogenates
Brain tissue homogenates were prepared for gelatin zymography
and Western blot. Striatum and cortex from the ischemic hemisphere
were collected, homogenized in lysis buffer and centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and the
total protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
Gelatin zymography
Equal amounts of protein (100 μg) were separated by electrophoresis in SDS-PAGE gels containing 1 mg/ml porcine skin gelatin (G2500,
Sigma, USA) at 100 V. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed and
incubated for 42 h at 37 °C with an incubation buffer. The gels were
stained with 0.5% Coomassie Blue R-250 (Sigma, USA) for 2 h and
then destained appropriately. To measure the activity of MMP-2 and
MMP-9, gels were read using the Gel-logic 2000 PRO Imaging System
(Carestream, USA) and quantiﬁed with Image J software.
Western blot
Equal amounts of protein (100 μg) were separated by Tris–
glycine SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes
were blocked with 5% skim milk and then incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: (1) rabbit polyclonal anti-GAPDH
antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA); (2) rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP-2 antibody (1:800, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA);
(3) rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA); and (4) rabbit polyclonal anti-PAI-1 antibody (1:800, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA). After incubation with the secondary anti-body
(1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA) for 2 h, immunoblots
were probed with ECL kit reagents (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
Then the membranes were exposed to X-ray ﬁlms. The X-ray ﬁlms
were scanned and the optical density was determined with Image J
software.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Statistical analysis
Tissue blocks of the infarction area were ﬁxed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde
overnight at 4 °C, and postﬁxed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h. Then the
specimens were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol,

SPSS 13.0 package was used for statistical analyses. Statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by LSD

tests for intergroup comparisons. All data were described as mean ±
standard error. P b 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Physiological parameters
Physiological parameters, including mean arterial blood pressure
(MABP), blood gasses and body temperatures were measured before
surgery. There were no signiﬁcant differences among the groups
(Table 1).

MMP-2 and MMP-9 are involved in the protective effects of TGF-β1
against HT
The activities and expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the ischemic
brain were detected by zymography and Western blot at 24 h after
MCAO (Fig. 5). Densitometric analysis showed increased activities and
expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in control animals compared with
the sham group (P b 0.05). And these levels were further increased by
rt-PA treatment (P b 0.05). Compared with the rt-PA group, the activities and expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were signiﬁcantly reduced
in the rt-PA + TGF-β1 group (P b 0.05). In addition, after TGF-β1 treatment, both MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions were decreased to the
levels of the control group, while their activities were signiﬁcantly
lower than that of the control group.

TGF-β1 suppresses HT associated with rt-PA treatment
Hemorrhage score was deﬁned 24 h after MCAO. HT occurred in 8/9
(88.9%) rats in the control group, 8/8 (100%) in the rt-PA group, and 7/7
(100%) in the rt-PA + TGF-β1 group. Compared with the control group,
hemorrhage score was signiﬁcantly increased in rats underwent rt-PA
thrombolysis (P b 0.05). Combined treatment with TGF-β1 decreased
the hemorrhage score (P b 0.05) (Fig. 1).

TGF-β1 attenuates BBB disruption induced by thrombolysis
Evans blue dye extravasation was calculated 24 h after MCAO
(Fig. 2). In the rt-PA group, there was a signiﬁcant increase of EB dye
extravasation over the control group (P b 0.05). The BBB permeability
was obviously decreased in the rt-PA+ TGF-β1 group compared with
the rt-PA group (P b 0.05).
Ultrastructure changes of the BBB were studied by electron microscopy (Fig. 3A). In the sham group, we saw the complete basement membrane and tight junctions. Basement membrane disruption was
observed following ischemia. After rt-PA thrombolysis, basement membrane was broken down and tight junctions were disappeared. In the rtPA+ TGF-β1 group, the basement membrane was almost unbroken and
the tight junctions were visible.
We further investigated the expressions of the major basement
membrane components, collagen IV and laminin, by immunohistochemistry in regions of the ischemic hemisphere (Figs. 3B and C). In
the sham group, positive collagen IV and laminin immunoreactivities
were easily identiﬁed in the extracellular matrix. These immunoreactivities were signiﬁcantly decreased after ischemia (P b 0.05), and further
reduced by rt-PA treatment (P b 0.05). The collagen IV and laminin
immunoreactivities were obviously increased by rt-PA and TGF-β1 cotreatment when compared with the rt-PA group (P b 0.05).

TGF-β1 upregulates the expression of PAI-1
PAI-1 level in the area of infarction was detected by Western blot at
24 h after MCAO (Fig. 4). There was a low level of expression in the
sham group. However, the protein was signiﬁcantly increased in the
condition of ischemia. This elevation was decreased after thrombolysis
treatment (P b 0.05). Compared with the rt-PA group, simultaneous administration of rt-PA and TGF-β1 markedly upregulated the expression
of PAI-1 (P b 0.05).

Discussion
BBB breakdown is a common pathological process after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (Popa-Wagner et al., 2010), and thought to be a
prerequisite for HT and poor outcome (Latour et al., 2004). The median
estimate of time from onset of ischemia to BBB disruption was proposed
to be 3.8 h, thus making it important to explore strategies to ameliorate
complications within the time window (Warach and Latour, 2004).
Here we used a single dose of TGF-β1 simultaneously with rt-PA at
3 h after ischemia, and found its ability to maintain BBB integrity, thereby reducing HT related to thrombolysis. In addition, we demonstrated
that PAI-1 upregulation and MMP-2/MMP-9 suppression were involved
in the protective effects of TGF-β1.
The BBB is composed of cellular elements and basement membrane.
The basement membrane is a specialized form of ECM that is mainly
formed by collagen IV and laminin (Wang and Shuaib, 2007;
Yurchenco and Schittny, 1990). In physiological condition, the production and degradation of ECM are in dynamic equilibrium. After cerebral
ischemia and reperfusion, the basement membrane is damaged
(Hamann et al., 2002), which is postulated to be the primary cause of
HT (Rosell et al., 2008). In this study, we observed the loss of basement
membrane and the degradation of collagen IV and laminin after rt-PA
treatment. These changes were accompanied by increased BBB leakage
and HT. Our results indicate that the basement membrane works as an
important barrier for preventing BBB disruption and HT after thrombolysis in stroke.
TGF-β1, known as an important inducer of ECM expression, was
demonstrated to have the ability to protect the basement membrane
in the present study, thereby reducing the BBB damage and HT induced
by rt-PA. The plasminogen–plasmin system and the matrix metalloproteinase system are thought to be the major pathways digesting the
basement membrane (Hamann et al., 2002). Therefore, we further
investigated whether TGF-β1 affects these two systems.
TGF-β1 has a well-established role in neuroprotection in experimental cerebral ischemia (Dobolyi et al., 2012). Particularly, it
upregulates astrocytic PAI-1 expression, thereby protects neurons
against excitotoxicity by inhibiting the t-PA-potentiated NMDAinduced neuronal death (Buisson et al., 2003). However, whether
the relationship between TGF-β1 and PAI-1/t-PA affects the BBB integrity has not yet been studied. PAI-1 is known as an acute-phase
protein, and increases rapidly after cerebral ischemia. Low PAI-1
level on admission in stroke patients may predict symptomatic

of ischemic hemisphere. (D) Quantitative analysis showed that the collagen IV and laminin immunoreactivities were signiﬁcantly decreased after ischemia and further reduced by rt-PA
treatment. The immunoreactivities were obviously increased in the rt-PA+ TGF-β1 group. Data were shown as mean ± standard error. n = 3 per group, 15 ﬁelds were selected (×400

intracranial hemorrhage after rt-PA therapy (Ribo et al., 2004). Exposure to rt-PA suppresses the synthesis of PAI-1 in endothelial
cells in vitro (Shatos et al., 1996). In the present study, we observed
in vivo that exogenous rt-PA lowered the brain PAI-1 level following
cerebral ischemia, implicating the etiology of HT associated with
thrombolysis. TGF-β1 coadministration upregulated PAI-1 expression in ischemic brain. The increased PAI-1 may thereby reduce the
t-PA activity by forming PAI-1/t-PA complex (Tjärnlund-Wolf et al.,
2012). Although the plasminogen–plasmin system cannot directly
cleave ECM molecules, it activates the MMPs (Hamann et al., 2002).
These results suggest that TGF-β1 may preserve the ECM and BBB integrity through regulation of the ﬁbrinolytic system.
MMPs, a family of zinc-binding proteolytic enzymes, are involved in
many physiological and pathological processes. Among the MMPs,
MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been intensively studied in the ﬁeld of stroke.
They degrade the basement membrane components, in particular collagen IV and laminin (Gasche et al., 1999), disrupt the BBB and increase

the risk of cerebral hemorrhage (Gidday et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2012).
The relationship between MMP-9 and rt-PA induced HT has also been
investigated. Stroke patients with highest baseline MMP-9 level develop
parenchymal hemorrhages after rt-PA therapy (Montaner et al., 2003).
In addition, exogenous t-PA upregulates MMP-9 and ampliﬁes the deleterious effects (Morancho et al., 2010). However, regarding the
association between MMP-2 and rt-PA induced HT, few studies have
been published and generated conﬂicting conclusions. Some researchers have observed the elevation of MMP-2 after rt-PA treatment
(Liu et al., 2010; Simard et al., 2012), while some others have not (Li
et al., 2011). In our study, MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the brain were elevated
and activated after ischemia, and the increases were expanded by rt-PA
therapy. The changes of MMPs were related to basal lamina degradation, BBB breakdown and HT. These results indicate that both MMP-2
and MMP-9 are therapeutic targets for BBB disruption after thrombolysis. So, the effect of TGF-β1 on expression and activation of MMPs
was also determined. We found the ability of TGF-β1 to suppress rt-

PA induced MMPs in the ischemic hemisphere. This inhibitory phenomenon may be partly due to the downregulation effect of TGF-β1 on the
ﬁbrinolytic system. Furthermore, TGF-β1 can work as an antiinﬂammatory cytokine, and may suppress MMP transcription via a
NF-κB site (Ogawa et al., 2004). In the study of abdominal aortic aneurysm, an inﬂammatory disease, TGF-β1 overexpression inhibits inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells, and decreases MMP-2 and MMP-9, resulting
in stabilization of abdominal aortic aneurysms already injured by inﬂammation and proteolysis (Dai et al., 2005).
Overall, our study demonstrated that TGF-β1 protects against BBB
disruption and HT after thrombolysis at the early stage of stroke. The
long-term effects beyond the ﬁrst day of ischemia remain to be determined. We also showed that the plasminogen–plasmin system and
the MMP system are involved in the protective effects of TGF-β1, but
both mechanisms warrant further study.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we found that exogenous TGF-β1 protects the integrity of basal lamina, thereby reduces rt-PA induced BBB disruption and
HT. One possible mechanism is through the elevation of PAI-1, thus directly inhibiting the activity of t-PA. Suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9
elevated by rt-PA may be another mechanism contributing to the protective effects of TGF-β1.
