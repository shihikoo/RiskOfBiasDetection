Abstract
Allopregnanolone is a neurosteroid synthesized from progesterone in brain. It increases inhibition through modulation of
the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptor. Both agents are putative neuroprotectants after ischemic stroke.
We sought to confirm their effectiveness in a hypertensive rat stroke model, with intra- and post-operative temperature
regulation. The primary study compared allopregnanolone, progesterone or vehicle control treatments, administered
105 minutes after induction of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Temperature
was controlled intraoperatively and a heat mat used in the 6 hours postoperatively to permit animal temperature selfregulation. The primary outcome was infarct volume and secondary outcomes were tests of sensory and motor function.
There was no significant effect of treatment on any outcome measure. Given prior reports of GABA-A receptor agonists
causing hypothermia, follow-up experiments were conducted to examine postoperative temperature regulation. These did
not reveal a difference in postoperative temperature in neurosteroid-treated animals compared to control. However, in all
rats maintained postoperatively in ambient temperature, moderate hypothermia was observed. This was in contrast to rats
maintained over a heat mat. The lowest mean postoperative temperature was between 34.4–34.9uC in all 3 groups. These
data do not support a neuroprotective effect of allopregnanolone or progesterone in ischemic stroke in hypertensives in the
setting of normothermia. Given previous evidence of synergy between neuroprotective agents and hypothermia,
demonstration of neuroprotective effect of these agents in the absence of postoperative hypothermia would be prudent
before consideration of these agents for further clinical investigation.

According to the recommendations of the Stroke Therapy
Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) [8] for preclinical
development of potential neuroprotectives, it is also important to
confirm neuroprotection in a disease model. Therefore, the
primary aim of this study was to evaluate the putative
neuroprotective effect of allopregnanolone and progesterone in
experimental stroke in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR),
measuring the effect of these agents on infarct volume with
secondary outcomes of neurobehavioral scores. A randomized,
blinded placebo-controlled study was undertaken comparing
treatment with allopregnanolone, progesterone or vehicle control
after 90 minute temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo). This methodologically rigorous design was used in
accordance with good laboratory practice recommendations [9].
Particular attention was paid to body temperature. Observation of
post-stroke body temperature alterations in some animals in the
treatment groups led to the hypothesis that hypothermia may
account for some of the neuroprotective benefits of these agents
reported in previous studies, in which post-operative temperature
was not recorded. A second series of experiments was therefore

Introduction
The neurosteroid allopregnanolone is synthesized de novo or
from systemic progesterone in neurons [1,2]. It is the most potent
known endogenous positive modulator of the inhibitory GABA-A
receptor. Both allopregnanolone and its parent compound,
progesterone, have been shown to reduce injury following
experimental brain injury including traumatic brain injury, and
stroke [3,4,5,6]. Two previous studies of allopregnanolone in
experimental stroke have shown a trend to greater neuroprotective
efficacy than progesterone using young, healthy rats [4]. Similar or
greater effect sizes have also been seen in mice. Neuroprotection
was shown not to be influenced by the presence or absence of the
progesterone receptor, thereby supporting the interpretation that
the effect is GABA-A mediated [6]. In both of these studies, as well
as in studies of other conditions, temperature was measured and
regulated in the intraoperative, but not the postoperative phase.
However previous investigations with another GABA-A agonist
showed that this agent resulted in hypothermia postoperatively [7].

session or until they consistently removed the adhesive label from
the forepaws immediately after it was applied. For outcome
analysis, speed of removal of an adhesive label from the distal
forepaw was recorded for each side, and speed relative to
contralateral and to pre-stroke baseline were calculated. Following
final behavioral testing, animals were perfused intracardially with
4% paraformaldehyde under deep anesthesia [10]. Brains were
post-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed and
paraffin embedded. Five micron thick sections at 1 mm intervals
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Photographed areas of
infarction and hemispheric areas were measured using Image J
software (NIH, Bethesda). If there were any areas where there was
any uncertainty regarding the presence of infarction based on the
photomicrograph alone, the sections were correlated with high
power microscopic evaluation of the region in question. Volumes
were calculated as a percentage of the ipsilateral hemisphere.

Methods
Animals
All animal experimentation was undertaken with the approval
of the animal care and ethics committee of the University of
Newcastle (Approval No. 1025) and in compliance with the
requirements of the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and
Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. A total of 62 male
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (290–350 g) were used
(Animal Resource Centre (ARC), Perth, Australia). For stroke
experiments, 46 animals were used. For follow up experiments of
body temperature during anesthetic recovery 16 animals were
used. Animals were housed 2–3 per cage in a temperature and
humidity controlled environment on a 12 hour light-dark cycle
and were fed a standard laboratory rat chow.

Effect on body temperature of recovery at ambient
temperature
A secondary study was performed to investigate the possibility
that allopregnanolone and/or progesterone may disrupt normal
thermoregulation in the immediate postoperative phase. Animals
were subjected to isoflurane anesthesia for 1 hour, during which
they had a temperature datalogger (SubCue, Calgary, Canada)
inserted in the extraperitoneal potential space, under the
abdominal musculature. Core body temperature was logged every
5 minutes for the following 24 hours. Immediately prior to
recovery from anesthesia animals received an intraperitoneal
injection of allopregnanolone (n = 6), progesterone (n = 4) or
vehicle (n = 6), with a follow up subcutaneous dose 6 hours later,
following the same regime as for the stroke experiments, including
concealment of treatment allocation. Intraoperative temperature
was maintained on a homeothermic heating mat, however after
waking from anesthesia animals were placed back in standard
cages with bedding materials, without the use of a hot water heat
mat. Ambient temperature adjacent to the cages was recorded.
Temperature data from a third cohort of animals are presented
for comparison of temperature regulation after MCAo with the
use of a heat mat postoperatively.. These animals were normothermic control animals from a separate study of the use of
hypothermia post stroke. They had stroke surgery, data logger
implantation and were then placed in cages K over heating mats
for 6 hours postoperatively, exactly as was done for the initial
cohort.

Surgery and administration of study compounds
MCAo was performed under isoflurane anesthesia using silicone
tipped intraluminal filaments (silicone tip external diameter and
length 0.35 & 2.5 mm respectively) as reported previously [10]. A
simple test of forelimb flexion was performed immediately prior to
re-induction of anesthesia for reperfusion at 90 minutes. Animals
without evidence of neurological deficit were excluded from
further study. At 105 minutes post-MCAo (while still anesthetized
post-reperfusion), rats were randomized to receive 1.5 mL i.p.
from a coded syringe containing allopregnanolone, progesterone
(both 8 mg/kg), or vehicle (30% cyclodextran) mixed by
sonication and warmed to body temperature. Six hours postMCAo a second identical injection was given subcutaneously.
Animals were only randomized to treatment following reperfusion
of the MCA. Treatment was contained in identical syringes
labeled with randomly generated 3 digit numbers. The allocation
code was prepared by a non-randomising investigator, and kept in
a sealed envelope in a locked cabinet until the completion of all
analyses. Hence all investigators were blind to treatment allocation
until completion of all analyses. Sample sizes were calculated to
enable detection of a 30% difference between treatment groups
with a power of 80% at alpha 0.05.

Temperature regulation
During surgery, animals were maintained at 37uC on a rectal
temperature regulated homeothermic heating mat (Physitemp
Instruments). Heart and respiratory rates, oxygen saturations and
tail-cuff systolic blood pressure (NIBP-R controller, ADInstruments) were monitored throughout surgery. Following MCAo,
animals were woken from anesthetic and housed individually in
cages placed K over a heating mat maintained at 37uC for the first
6 hours postoperatively, after which they were returned to the
animal house. Rectal temperature was taken at 2, 6 and 24 hours
post-stroke.

Statistics
Comparisons of infarct volumes and other continuous variables
were performed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple
comparisons test. Categorical variables such as behavioral scores
were analysed using a Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Dunn’s
test for significant results. Temperature data in part 2 was analysed
using 2-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Bonferroni
post-hoc tests. Infarct volumes are presented as mean 695%
confidence intervals. Physiological and other data are presented as
mean6 standard deviations, unless otherwise specified.

Outcome analyses
The prespecified primary outcome was infarct volume at
24 hours, and secondary outcomes were a composite behavioral
score and performance on the ‘‘sticky-dot removal test’’. Neurological scoring was performed at 2 and 24 hours. This consisted of
a composite score of forelimb flexion, torso twisting and lateral
push [11]. At 24 hours the sticky-dot (adhesive removal) test was
performed [12,13]. In the 4 weeks prior to stroke induction,
animals received at least 3 training sessions with 3 repetitions per
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org

Exclusions
In total, 8 animals were excluded from analysis. Three had no
stroke deficit prior to reperfusion, 2 had the occluding suture
inadvertently completely withdrawn at reperfusion (leaving a
potential silicone embolus intravascularly). Two animals were
excluded due to inadvertent administration of (concealed) treatment at the incorrect time interval and 1 animal was excluded due

to death at 4 hours postoperatively, rendering both infarct and
behavioural outcomes unobtainable. This animal did not have a
large deficit on neurological score 2 hours previously, and the
death remained unexplained after post-mortem examination (this
animal received allopregnanolone). A further animal (allopregnanolone) had unquantifiable infarct volume due to damage to the
brain during the fixation process. Therefore for the allopregnanolone group infarct volume data n = 11, and behavioral data
n = 12. Progesterone and vehicle groups had n = 13 for all data.

were 21.260.3, 21.360.7 and 21.160.4uC next to the allopregnanolone, progesterone and vehicle group cages, respectively. In
all animals, core body temperatures dropped by 5–7% of baseline
to, 34.960.4uC, 34.460.8uC, and 34.460.4uC for allopregnanolone, progesterone and vehicle groups respectively. These low
temperatures occurred at a mean time of 44620 minutes,
45614 minutes, and 48610 minutes post recovery from anesthesia for allopregnanolone, progesterone and vehicle groups
respectively. There were no significant temperature differences
between treatment groups at any time. The mean temperatures of
all groups at each time point are presented at Figure. 2 (note these
are somewhat higher than the numbers presented above, due to
pooling of groups and the resultant variability in timing of the
lowest temperature in each animal). Datalogger insertion had no
significant effect on body temperature, since the mean rectal
temperatures obtained in the initial experiments (stroke +
treatment) at 2, 6 and 24 hours were not significantly different
to the datalogger temperatures at the same times in the separate
post-stroke comparison group. Temperatures at 2 h were
37.360.6 and 36.960.6uC, at 6 h were 37.660.7 and
37.760.3uC, and at 24 h were 36.961.1 and 37.560.6uC for
rectal and datalogger temperatures, respectively.

Results
Stroke Outcomes
No significant differences were detected in physiological data at
baseline or during the intra- and postoperative periods between
any groups (allopregnanolone, progesterone and vehicle) (Table 1).
Infarct volumes were 34615%, 39615% and 3669% (means
695% confidence interval) of the hemispheric volume in the
allopregnanolone, progesterone and vehicle treatment groups
respectively (Figure. 1). There were no significant differences
between groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences
between groups on any individual or composite behavioral scores
(Table 2). Despite no significant differences at any time point of
the group means of postoperative temperature, at 24 hours there
were three outlier animals with core temperature below 35uC.
This was the only time point at which cages were not K over a
heat mat, and all the outliers were from the allopregnanolone
group. This observation prompted the second series of experiments to evaluate body temperature changes during the early postoperative recovery period.

Discussion
We found that allopregnanolone and progesterone had no
neuroprotective effect in hypertensive animals when body
temperature was carefully maintained during and after surgery
(Figure 1). Neither drug had an independent effect on body
temperature (Figure 2). These randomized, blinded and appropriately powered data suggest that neither drug is likely to be of
major benefit to hypertensive patients, which comprise .50% of
the stroke population.
This data is in stark contrast to previously published studies of
the use of allopregnanolone in experimental stroke in rats and
mice [4,6]. The dosage of the steroids used in the present study

Postoperative temperature changes
In the second series of experiments (body temperature during
recovery), there were no significant differences in ambient air

shown to have a synergistic effect with mild hypothermia [32,33].
Such synergy could be exploited for treatment, however inducing
even mild hypothermia in patients is far more difficult than in
postoperative small animals.
Another important difference was the use of spontaneously
hypertensive rats. Few stroke neuroprotection studies examine
efficacy in the face of the co-morbidities common in patients,
however this was a key recommendation of the STAIR committee
update [34]. While the benefits of hypothermia are maintained in
the face of hypertension [35], this does not appear to always be the
case for neuroprotective agents in experimental models. The
degree of neuroprotection produced by the spin-trap agent NXY059 in SHRs was significantly less than that in normotensive
strains [36]. This agent was not shown to have any benefit in the
subsequent large-scale clinical trial [37]. While neuroprotection by
progesterone has been reported after MCAo in SHRs [18], those
experiments were not temperature controlled in the postoperative
phase.
Timing of stroke treatment with neuroprotectants is also critical.
Reports on the importance of reperfusion injury [38] also suggest
that treatment administration prior to reperfusion [4], rather than
after, may be important in the neuroprotective activity of these
agents. However, such a hypothesis is not consistent with reported
neuroprotection by progesterone following permanent MCAo
[19].

[3,5,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. However, there have been other
similarly negative studies in ovariectomised female rats treated
with either allopregnanolone or progesterone [29,30]. Additionally, a recent single animal data meta-analysis of progesterone
neuroprotection after stroke presented evidence of significant
publication bias – i.e. that negative studies may not have been
published [29]. What might account for the difference of the
current study from those showing neuroprotection?
One significant difference between this study and previous
neuroprotection studies using these agents (in stroke and other
models of neural injury), is the provision of warming during the
postoperative period (6 hours), and the measurement of body
temperature during this interval. All mammals including humans
are prone to development of postoperative hypothermia if
warming is not provided [31]. This can be profoundly neuroprotective and has led to false positive detection of neuroprotection, a
phenomenon reported for other GABAergic agents such as
clomethiazole [7]. Neither allopregnanolone nor progesterone
altered body temperature beyond the moderate hypothermia
induced by anesthesia for several hours in all non-stroked animals
(Figure 2). However, some other neuroprotective agents have been

dose of progesterone used was that previously found effective in
both SHR and other strains [18], and the allopregnanolone dose
chosen was based on that shown to be successful in other strains of
rat in studies of occlusion and neurotrauma [4,27,28]. The lack of
treatment effect in this study may suggest a need for further dose
studies to determine the full limitations of neuroprotection of these
neurosteroids, and whether higher doses are effective in hypertensives.
This study was designed in order to avoid some of the
experimental factors that have been identified as being of
importance in previous failures of translation of successful
neuroprotectants from the laboratory into clinical practice [36].
The use of a priori sample size calculations, randomization,
concealment of treatment allocation and blinded outcome
assessment have been shown to be important aspects of trial
design, preventing overestimate of efficacy of the intervention
[9,39,40]. An important corollary is that implementation of such
good laboratory practice is expected to reduce the number of ‘false
positive’ results, and will therefore increase the number of negative
results.
In contrast to prior studies, the current data demonstrate no
difference in infarct volume or functional outcome measures
compared to vehicle control in animals receiving either allopregnanolone or progesterone at standard doses. The use of
postoperative temperature maintenance in this study, in contrast
to previous investigations, raises the possibility that these agents
are not effective at normal body temperatures or in the setting of
hypertension – both of which are most commonly present in stroke
patients. These findings suggest a need for further experimental
study to determine the suitability of allopregnanolone or its
precursors for clinical trial.

Potential limitations of this study are that we used an early
sacrifice time (24 h) and that we only investigated one dose of the
neurosteroids. Had there been benefit of treatment at 24 h,
confirmation of neuroprotection would have been required with
longer survival studies to exclude the possibility of treatment
merely delaying rather than preventing infarct progression The
