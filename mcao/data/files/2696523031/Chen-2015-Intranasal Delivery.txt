Abstract
Apelin is a peptide originally isolated from bovine stomach tissue extracts and identified as an endogenous ligand of the APJ
receptor; recent work showed that apelin ameliorates the ischemic injury in the heart and the brain. Being an analogue to the
angiotensin II receptor, the apelin/APJ signaling may mediate angiogenesis process. We explored the noninvasive intranasal
brain delivery method and investigated therapeutic effects of apelin-13 in a focal ischemic stroke model of mice. Intranasal
administration of apelin-13 (4 mg/kg) was given 30 min after the onset of stroke and repeated once daily. Three days after
stroke, mice received apelin-13 had significantly reduced infarct volume and less neuronal death in the penumbra. Western
blot analyses showed upregulated levels of apelin, apelin receptor APLNR, and Bcl-2 and decreased caspase-3 activation in
the apelin-13-treated brain. The proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1b, and chemokine
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA increased in the ischemic brain, which were significantly attenuated by
apelin-13. Apelin-13 remarkably reduced microglia recruitment and activation in the penumbra according to morphological
features of Iba-1-positive cells 3 days after ischemia. Apelin-13 significantly increased the expression of angiogenic factor
vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinase-9 14 days after stroke. Angiogenesis illustrated by collagen
IV þ /5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridin þ colabeled cells was significantly increased by the apelin-13 treatment 21 days after stroke.
Finally, apelin-13 promoted the local cerebral blood flow restoration and long-term functional recovery. This study demonstrates a noninvasive intranasal delivery of apelin-13 after stroke, suggesting that the reduced inflammatory activities,
decreased cell death, and increased angiogenesis contribute to the therapeutic benefits of apelin-13.

Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of human death and disability in
the adult population in the United States and around the
world. Among all stroke patients, 87% suﬀer from ischemic
stroke (Roger et al., 2012). So far eﬀective stroke treatments are still limited to thrombolytic therapy using tissue
plasminogen activator with a narrow time window of 4.5 hr
after the onset of an ischemic attack (Shobha et al., 2011;
Jauch et al., 2013). Thus, stroke represents a clinical entity
that requires more innovative treatments both for acute
neuroprotection and for regenerative tissue repair.
Apelin was originally isolated from bovine stomach
tissue extracts. It has been identiﬁed as an endogenous

ligand of the APJ receptor, a G protein-coupled receptor
related to angiotensin receptor AT1 (Lee et al., 2000a).
Apelin is derived from a 77-amino acid length precursor

peptide that can be cleaved by angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 into active apelins, including apelin-36
(42–77), apelin-17 (61–77), and apelin-13 (65–77; Lee
et al., 2000b). Apelin-13 has completely conserved 13
C-terminal amino acids that are cross all species and
exhibits the highest biological potency, including cardiomyocytes protection (Hosoya et al., 2000; Kleinz and
Davenport, 2005; Simpkin et al., 2007). The active apelins
are widely distributed in various organs and tissues,
including the brain, lungs, testis, and uterus, and are
highly expressed in the cardiovascular system. In the
brain, apelins are widely expressed in neuronal cell
bodies and ﬁbers throughout the entire neuroaxis
(Cheng et al., 2012). In neurological diseases, apelin
level is signiﬁcantly altered in the central nervous
system. For example, apelin is signiﬁcantly elevated in the
epileptogenic temporal neocortex and absent in glial cells of
temporal lobe epilepsy patients (Zhang et al., 2011).
Apelin receptor AGTRL1 was shown to associate with
the development of ischemic stroke in the most recent
genome-wide association study for ischemic stroke
(Hata et al., 2011). As a neuropeptide, apelin exhibits
neuroprotective function in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Pretreatment with apelin-13 or apelin-36 peptides,
alone or in combination, increased hippocampal neuronal survival from 25% to 50% to 75% after HIVinduced excitotoxic injury (O’Donnell et al., 2007). Our
previous in vitro study also showed that apelin-13 reduced
serum deprivation-induced reactive oxygen species generation, mitochondria depolarization, cytochrome c release,
and activation of caspase-3. We showed that apelin-13
could regulate cell survival kinases the protein kinase B
(PKB, also known as AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in cultured cortical neurons (Zeng
et al., 2010). Most recently, apelin-13 was also demonstrated to protect brain from ischemia/reperfusion (IR)
injury through activation of AKT and ERK1/2 signaling
pathways in a mouse focal transient cerebral ischemia
model (Yang et al., 2014). In a cerebral middle artery
occlusion ﬁlament stroke model, apelin-36 reduced cell
death and cerebral edema (Khaksari et al., 2012; Gu
et al., 2013).
APJ has high-sequence homology with the angiotensin
II type I receptor, but it binds to apelin instead of angiotensin II (O’Dowd et al., 1993; Lee et al., 2000a). Due
to its similarity to the angiotensin II receptor, the functions of APJ have been widely studied on the cardiovascular system. Increasing evidence shows that the apelin/
APJ signaling mediates the angiogenesis process.
Overexpression of apelin increased Sirt3, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR2, and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1)/Tie-2 expression and the density of
capillary and arteriole in the heart of diabetic mice
(Zeng et al., 2014). Inhibition of apelin expression
switched endothelial cells from proliferative to mature

state in pathological retinal angiogenesis (Kasai et al.,
2013). The proangiogenic role of apelin was also demonstrated in myocardial IR injury and murine hindlimb
ischemia model. The loss of apelin impaired the
angiogenesis and functional recovery, and exacerbated
myocardial IR injury, while the elevation of apelin
expression induced by adeno-associated virus transduction beneﬁted the postischemic hindlimb perfusion (Qin
et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). All the above evidence
indicates the potential regenerative eﬀects of apelin and a
therapeutic application after ischemia. However, in all
these in vivo studies, apelin was administered through lateral cerebral ventricle injection, which is highly invasive
and less feasible in clinical conditions. As a potential protective drug for ischemic stroke treatment, it is important
to seek for a noninvasive method to deliver apelin.
Intranasal administration is a noninvasive method to
direct protein and peptide drugs into the brain by utilizing the olfactory neuronal distribution pathways in the
cribriform plate, which leads to direct nose-to-brain drug
distribution, bypasses the blood–brain barrier (BBB), and
directly guides therapeutics to the brain (Hanson and
Frey, 2008; Dhuria et al., 2010). Intranasal administration can directly transfer protein and peptides to the
brain in similar or higher concentrations than that can
be obtained by systemic administration (Scaﬁdi et al.,
2014). In this investigation, we tested the hypothesis
that the neuroprotective eﬀects of apelin-13 can be
achieved by noninvasive intranasal delivery via reducing
the infarct formation and inﬂammatory activities after
ischemic stroke, leading to a long-term angiogenesis
and functional recovery after stroke.

Materials and Methods
Focal Ischemic Stroke Model
All animal experiments and surgery procedures were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and met NIH standard. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in adult male C57/BL6 mice, which were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories and housed
at Emory University in standard cages in 12 hr light/12 hr
dark cycles. Surgery procedures were modiﬁed from a
previously described rat protocol (Wei et al., 2005).
Brieﬂy, animals were subjected to 4% chloral hydrate
anesthesia, and the distal branches of the right middle
cerebral artery (MCA) were permanently ligated by a
10-0 suture (Surgical Specialties CO., Reading, PA,
USA). The creation of the sensorimotor cortical ischemia
was completed by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (CCA) for 7 min followed by reperfusion.
During surgery and recovery periods, body temperature
was monitored and maintained at 37.0  0.5 C using a
temperature control unit and heating pads.

Intranasal Drug Administration

Immunofluorescence Staining

Intranasal drug delivery was performed as previously
described with minor modiﬁcations (Scaﬁdi et al.,
2014). All animals (25–28 g) received 100 U hyaluronidase (Sigma, St. Lous, MO) dissolved in sterile phosphate-buﬀered saline 30 min prior to the apelin-13
administration. By catalyzing the hydrolysis of hyaluronan, hyaluronidase can increase tissue permeability.
Apelin-13 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in sterile saline at 1 mg/ml concentration; 5–10 ml
drops containing the saline or apelin-13 (1 mg/ml) were
carefully placed on one nostril of conscious animal,
allowing it to be snorted, alternating the nostrils with
1 min intervals. A total volume of 100 ml saline or
apelin-13 (1 mg/ml, equivalent to 4 mg/kg) was administered to each ischemic animal 30 min after stroke onset
and followed by once daily until animals were sacriﬁced.
5-Bromo-20 -deoxyuridin (BrdU, 50 mg/kg; Sigma) was
administered intraperitoneally to label proliferating cells
since Day 3 after stroke until animals were sacriﬁced.

Fresh frozen brain sections were stained by using standard protocols for NeuN (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA)
to label neurons, collagen IV (Millipore) to label vessels,
BrdU (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK) to label newborn cells,
and occludin (Life technologies, Grand Island, NY,
USA) to detect the BBB. Pictures were taken by using
ﬂuorescence microscopy along the length of the penumbra region deﬁned morphologically as the region just outside the stroke core. Perfusion-ﬁxed brain sections were
used for Iba-1 (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA, USA)
and F4/80 (AbD Serotec) staining, followed by standard
staining protocol. Staining was visualized by ﬂuorescent
microscopy (BX61; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For systematic random sampling in design-based stereological
cell counting, six coronal brain sections per mouse were
selected, spaced 90 mm apart across the same region of
interest in each animal. For multistage random sampling,
six ﬁelds per brain section were randomly chosen in the
peri-infarct/penumbra region of the brain. All counting
assays were performed under blind condition. The area of
positive staining was measured using the fraction area
measurement function of NIH Image J software.
The data analysis of reactive microglia in the penumbra region was based on the morphological assessment of
Iba-1-positive cells according to published method
(Soltys et al., 2001). Brieﬂy, based on the length of
branches, thickness of branches, and cell body volume,
the Iba-1-positive cells were categorized to three classes:
(a) ramiﬁed microglia (surveillant/resting microglia),
characterized by small round or oval cell bodies containing a small volume of cytoplasm; (b) hypertrophied
microglia, which had larger cell bodies and thicker processes than ramiﬁed microglia; and (c) bushy microglia,
which had numerous but short processes forming thick
bundles around their swollen cell bodies. Hypertrophied
and bushy Iba-1-positive cells were identiﬁed as activated
microglia.

Quantification of Infarct Volume
Infarct volume was assessed 3 days after ischemia by
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The
brains were removed and placed in a coronal brain
matrix and then sliced into 1-mm sections. Slices were
incubated in 2% TTC (Sigma) solution at 37 C for
5 min and then stored in 10% buﬀered formalin for
24 hr. The digital images of the caudal aspect of each
slice were obtained using a ﬂatbed scanner. Infarct, ipsilateral hemisphere, and contralateral hemisphere areas
were measured using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda,
MD, USA). Infarct volume was calculated using the
indirect method (Swanson et al., 1990).

Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase Biotin-dUPT
Nick-End Labeling
A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUPT
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay kit (DeadEnd
Fluorometric TUNEL system; Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) was used to assess cell death by detecting fragmented DNA in 10 -mm-thick coronal fresh frozen sections. Brieﬂy, after ﬁxation in 10% buﬀered formalin
for 10 min and then ethanol:acetic acid (2:1) solution
for 5 min, permeabilization was done in 0.2% Triton-X
100 solution. Brain sections were incubated in equilibration buﬀer for 10 min and then in recombinant terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (rTdT) and nucleotide mixture at 37 C for 60 min in the dark. Reactions were terminated by 2  SSC solution for 15 min. Nuclei were
counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (1:20,000; Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) for 5 min.

Western Blot Analysis
The peri-infarct/penumbra region was deﬁned as previously described by a 500-mm boundary extending from
the edge of the infarct core, medial, and lateral to the
infarct (Ohab et al., 2006). Tissue samples were taken
from the peri-infarct/penumbra region of the cortex,
and proteins were extracted by homogenization in protein
lysis buﬀer (25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl,
5 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate,
100 mM NaF, 1% Triton, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). Protein (30 mg) from each sample was loaded into
a gradient gel and run at constant current until protein
markers had adequately separated. They were transferred
onto polyvinyl diﬂuoride membranes that were then

probed by using standard protocols (Choi et al., 2012).
Primary antibodies Bcl-2 (1:1000; Cell signaling, Boston,
MA, USA); cleaved caspase-3 (1:500; Cell signaling);
VEGF (1:100; Santa Cruz, Dallas, Texas, USA); brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 1:500; Santa Cruz);
matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9; 1:500; Santa Cruz);
Apelin (C-13; 1:100; Santa Cruz); APJR-1 (H-300; 1:100;
Santa Cruz); and mouse b-actin antibody (1:6000; Sigma)
were applied overnight at 4 C. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied for 1 to 2 hr at
room temperature. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
antibodies were developed by using nitro-blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3’-indolyphosphate solution.
The intensity of each band was measured and subtracted
by the background using NIH Image J software. The
expression ratio of each target protein was then normalized against b-actin.

Gelatin Zymography Assay
MMP assay kit (Biomedical Research Service Center,
Buﬀalo, NY, USA) was used to detect the activity of
MMP9. The procedure for gelatin zymography assay followed the instructions provided in the kit. Brieﬂy, the
tissue was homogenized, and protein was extracted in
cell lysis solution. Protein sample (50 mg) was loaded
and run in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel copolymerized
with substrate (1 mg/ml of gelatin) until protein markers
had adequately separated. After washing with 1  MMP
wash buﬀer for 15 min, the gel was incubated in
1  MMP reaction buﬀer at 37 C for 48 hr. The gel was
then stained in a 3% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250 solution for 90 min and destained in 10% methanol/10%
acetic acid solution until the MMP bands fully develop
against the blue background. MMP9 band intensity was
quantiﬁed using the NIH Image J software.

Isolation of Total RNA and RT-PCR
Total RNA from tissues of experimental brains was isolated according to manufacturer’s instruction (Life
Technologies). RNA integrity was conﬁrmed by detection
of 28 s and 18 s rRNA band. RNA was conﬁrmed to be
free of genomic DNA contamination by PCR in the
absence of reverse transcriptase. The RNA samples
(1 mg) were reverse transcribed in 20 ml of a reaction mixture containing 2  RT buﬀer and 20  RT enzyme mix
according
to
manufacturer’s
instruction
(Life
Technologies) at 37 C for 60 min. The samples were
then incubated at 95 C for 5 min and transferred to
4 C. RT product (1 ml) was subjected to PCR ampliﬁcation with 10 pmole primer, 10  standard Taq reaction
buﬀer, 10 mM dNTP, and 0.625 unit Taq polymerase in
20 ml PCR reaction buﬀer (New England Biolabs Inc.,
Ipswich, MA, USA). PCR primers were used as follows

cycles consisted of 95 C for 15 s, 60 C for 1 min, and
72 C for 30 s. After additional incubation at 72 C for
10 min, the PCR samples were transferred to 4 C. PCR
products were subjected to electrophoresis in 2% agarose
gel with ethidium bromide. Relative intensity of a PCR
band was analyzed using InGenius3 manual gel documentation systems (Syngene, Frederick, MD, USA).

Local Cerebral Blood Flow Measurement
Laser scanning imaging was used to measure local
cerebral blood ﬂow (LCBF) as previously described (Li
et al., 2007) at three time points: immediately before
MCA ligation, right after occlusion, during the 7 min
bilateral CCA ligation and 21 days after ischemia.
Brieﬂy, animals were anesthetized with an injection of
4% chloral hydrate solution, and an incision was made
to expose the skull above the territory of the right MCA.
The laser was centered over the right coronal suture.
Diﬀerent from the conventional Laser Doppler probe
that measures a small point of blood ﬂow, the scanner
method measures a 2.4  2.4 mm square area using the
Laser Doppler perfusion imaging system (PeriFlux
System 5000-PF5010 LDPM unit, Perimed, Stockholm,
Sweden). This scanning measurement largely avoids
inaccurate or bias results caused by inconsistent location
of the laser prob. Data were analyzed using the LDPI
Win 2 software (Perimed AB, Stockholm, Sweden).

HomeCageScan and TopScan Behavioral
Assessment
The behavioral changes of experimental mice were monitored and analyzed using the HomeCageScan system
(Clever Sys Inc., Reston, VA, USA) for 12 hr starting
from 2 days to 3 days after stroke. The system had four
cameras that monitored four cages, with each cage

Chen et al.

5

(191 mm  292 mm  127 mm) containing one mouse.
The behavior patterns were continuously recorded for
12 hr at dark cycle). After ﬁnishing the recording, the
videos were analyzed by the HomeCage Software 3.0
(Clever Sys Inc.). Three days after stroke, the motor function of the mouse was measured by the TopScan system
(Clever Sys Inc.). All procedures were carried out in a
square open-ﬁeld test chamber (50 cm  50 cm  50 cm).
Mice were placed in the center of the chamber and
allowed to move around freely for 1 hr. Behaviors such
as distance, velocity, and the entries into the center area
were captured and analyzed using the TopScan software
2.0 (Clever Sys Inc.). The arena was cleaned with 70%
ethanol after each mouse completed a session.

Adhesive Removal Test
The adhesive removal test measures sensorimotor function as previously described (Bouet et al., 2009). A small
adhesive dot was placed on each forepaw, and the time
(seconds) needed to contact and remove the sticker from
each forepaw was recorded. Mice were trained three times
before stroke surgery to ensure that they have normal
sensorimotor function. Recording was stopped if the
animal failed to contact the sticker within 2 min. The
test was performed three times per mouse, and the average time was used in the analysis at 21 days after stroke.

Statistical Analysis
Student’s t test was used for the comparison of two
experimental groups. Multiple comparisons were done
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
with Tukey test for multiple pairwise examinations. Twoway ANOVA followed with Bonferroni posttests was
used for comparisons of multiple groups with multiple
time points. Changes were identiﬁed as signiﬁcant if p
was less than .05. Mean values were reported together
with the standard error of the mean.

Results
Apelin-13 Reduced the Infarct Volume After
Ischemic Stroke
Adult male mice were subjected to focal cerebral ischemia
targeting the right sensorimotor cortex (Wei et al., 2005).
Thirty minutes after the onset of ischemia, randomly
assigned animals received saline vehicle control or
apelin-13 (4 mg/kg) treatment via the intranasal route.
The treatments were repeated once daily until the day
of sacriﬁce. Three days after the ischemic stroke, brain
coronal sections were analyzed for infarct formation
using TTC staining. In stroke control mice, the cerebral
ischemia induced a signiﬁcant infarction in the right

sensorimotor cortex (10.27  0.63% infarction of the ipsilateral hemisphere). Apelin-13 treatment signiﬁcantly
reduced the infarct volume by 25.8% compared with
the stroke control group (Figure 1(a) to (c)).
To verify that intranasally administered apelin-13
reached the brain, the apelin level in the brain was measured using Western blot assay. As early as 30 min after
intranasal administration, the apelin level was noticeably
higher in the ipsilateral cortex compared with that in
stroke control animals (Figure 2(a) and (b)).

Apelin-13 Protects Brain Against Apoptotic Cell
Death After Ischemic Stroke
To understand the mechanism of protective eﬀect of
apelin-13 at the cellular level, we performed the
TUNEL staining to detect the apoptotic cell death at 3
days after stroke. In apelin-13 treatment group, there
were signiﬁcantly fewer TUNEL-positive cells
(18.7  3.1%; n ¼ 5 animals) in the penumbra region,
compared with stroke control group (32.8  2.3%; n ¼ 5
animals, p < .05; Figure 2(c) and (d)). Neuronal cell death
was reduced by apelin-13 treatment evidenced by reduced
number of TUNEL-positive cells double stained with the
neuronal marker NeuN (Figure 2(c) and (e)). The protein
expression of apelin receptor APLNR and the antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2 in the penumbra region of the brain was
signiﬁcantly higher in apelin-13-treated animals compared with those in stroke control animals (Figure 2(a),
(f), and (g)). In addition, the activity of the key apoptotic
enzyme caspase-3 was suppressed by apelin-13 3 days
after stroke (Figure 2(a) and (h)).

Apelin-13 Reduced Inflammation After
Ischemic Stroke
Inﬂammation and microglial activation play important
roles in the pathogenesis of stroke (Yenari et al., 2010).
To measure the microglial activation, we evaluated the
expression of ionized calcium biding adaptor molecule1 (Iba-1) in the penumbra region at 3 days after stroke.
Immunostaining results revealed that the number of
Iba-1-positive cells in the stroke brain signiﬁcantly
increased in the penumbra region. The morphological
assessment of Iba-1-positive cells revealed that in the
penumbra region, there were few microglia with ramiﬁed morphology of surveillant microglia, and the
majority of Iba-1-positive cells were activated microglia
with hypertrophied and bushy shapes (Soltys et al.,
2001). On the other hand, stroke animals received
apelin-13 treatment showed signiﬁcant reductions in
the total number of Iba-1-positive cells as well as in
the number of activated microglia (Figure 3(a) to
(d)). At 3 days after stroke, there were also inﬁltrating
macrophages recruited to the ischemic cortex, which

Figure 1. Apelin-13 reduced the infarct volume after ischemic stroke. Apelin-13 was administered 30 min after barrel cortex focal
ischemic stroke onset and followed by once daily for 3 days after stroke. TTC staining was performed at 3 days after stroke to evaluate the
infarct formation after stroke (a). Apelin-13 treatment significantly reduced the indirect infarct volume (b) and indirect infarct ratio (c).
Data were represented as mean  SEM, *p < .05; n ¼ 12 in stroke þ vehicle group and n ¼ 14 in stroke þ apelin group. TTC ¼ 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride.

were both F4/80 and Iba-1 positive, mostly located in
the ischemic core region, with few cells in the penumbra (Supplemental Figure 1).
Because microglial activation following ischemic injury
was known to release the pro- or anti-inﬂammatory cytokines (Lucas et al., 2006), we measured the levels of the
inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines in the penumbra
region at 24 hr and 3 days after stroke. RT-PCR experiments showed a moderate increase in TNF-a expression
24 hr after stroke and a marked increase 3 days after
stroke. Apelin-13 treatment signiﬁcantly suppressed the
elevation of TNF-a 3 days after stroke (Figure 3(e) and
(f)). The expression of IL-1b signiﬁcantly increased in the
penumbra region 24 hr after stroke, and this elevated
level sustained at least until 3 days after stroke. Aplein13 treatment signiﬁcantly attenuated the increase of IL1b after stroke (Figure 3(e) and (g)). However, the expression of IL-6 was not statistically diﬀerent among
the sham, stroke control, and apelin-13 treatment
groups (data not shown). Interestingly, the mRNA

expression of the anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-10
increased in the apelin-13-treated animals compared
with those in the sham group 3 days after stroke
(Figure 3(e) and (h)). Besides the pro- or anti-inﬂammatory cytokines, we also found signiﬁcantly less proinﬂammatory chemokines such as MIP-1a and MCP-1 in
apelin-13-treated animals at 3 days after stroke
(Figure 3(e), (i), and (j)). These results suggested that
apelin-13 treatment could suppress microglial activation
and inhibit the release of proinﬂammatory cytokines and
chemokines after stroke. Meanwhile, it may increase the
anti-inﬂammatory factor IL-10.

Apelin-13 Enhanced Angiogenesis After
Ischemic Stroke
We tested the hypothesis that apelin-13 could enhance the
postischemia angiogenesis in the brain. Animals received
daily injections of BrdU beginning on the Day 3 after
ischemic stroke to label the newborn cells until sacriﬁced

mRNA level after stroke (f). IL-1b expression significantly increased and the elevation sustained until 3 days after stroke. Apelin-13
treatment significantly ameliorated this elevation (g). IL-10 expression remained about the same level after stroke; however, apelin-13
treatment significantly enhanced the level of this anti-inflammatory factor in the penumbra measured at 3 days after stroke (H). Apelin-13
treatment also showed significant reduction in the mRNA levels of MCP-1 and MIP-1a 3 days after stroke (i and j). *p < .05 versus sham,

at 21 days after stroke. The number of BrdU-positive
cells colocalized with collagen IV was examined as a
marker of angiogenesis. There were signiﬁcantly more
BrdUþ/collagen IVþ colabeled cells in the peri-infarct
region in apelin-13-treated stroke animals (45.2  6.7 vs.
74.5  6.7 in stroke þ vehicle and stroke þ apelin-13
groups, respectively; p < .05, n ¼ 6 animals each group),
suggesting enhanced angiogenesis in apelin-13-treated
animals (Figure 4(a) and (b)). Twenty-one days after
stroke, lower collagen IV expression was found in the
peri-infarct region of stroke animals compared with
that in the cortex of sham animals, suggesting a deteriorating eﬀect on the vasculature. Apelin-13 treatment
resulted in signiﬁcantly increased collagen IV expression
in the peri-infarct region 21 days after stroke (Figure 4(a)
and (c)).
To elucidate the possible mechanisms of the proangiogenic eﬀects of apelin, we measured the expression of
angiogenesis related factors in the peri-infarct region at
14 days after stroke. VEGF, BDNF, and MMP9 were
measured using Western blot analysis, and the results
showed that apelin-13 signiﬁcantly increased the protein
expression of VEGF and MMP9 in the peri-infarct
region. The level of BDNF expression was similar
between experimental groups (Figure 4(d) to (g)). In addition, gelatin zymography was used to assess the activity
of MMP9 in the peri-infarct region. Consistent with
Western blot analysis, results from this assay veriﬁed
that apelin-13-treated animals showed enhanced activity
of MMP9, compared with those in stroke control animals
14 days after stroke (Figure 4(h)). On the other hand,
there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the level of MMP9
protein expression in the contralateral cortex between
groups (Supplemental Figure 2(a)). To examine whether
the enhanced MMP9 activity in the peri-infarct region
might aﬀect the integrity of BBB, we measured the
expression of tight-junction protein occludin in this
region using immunoﬂuorescence staining at 14 days
after stroke. The results showed that there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the expression of occludin between
stroke control and apelin-13 treatment groups
(Supplemental Figure 2(b) and (c)).

Apelin-13 Improved Local Blood Flow Restoration
and Functional Recovery After Ischemic Stroke
To demonstrate that the increased angiogenesis could
build functional vasculatures, we measured the LCBF
using a Laser Doppler Scanner at 21 days after stroke.
The scanning imaging showed that stroke animals that
received apelin-13 treatment had signiﬁcantly greater
recovery of local blood ﬂow compared with the stroke
control animals (77.2  3.5% vs. 85.9  0.27% in stroke þ vehicle and stroke þ apelin-13 groups, respectively;
p < .05; n ¼ 10 each group; Figure 5(a) and (b)).

We next assessed if the intranasal apelin-13 delivery
could improve the behavior deﬁcits after acute stroke.
To speciﬁcally examine the sensorimotor functional outcomes after stroke, adhesive removal test was performed
at 3 and 21 days after stroke. After the ischemic damage
to the sensorimotor cortex in the right hemisphere, animals showed signiﬁcant prolonged time in response to the
sticky dot attached to their left paws. Animals received
apelin-13 treatment showed trends in shortening the time
to contact the adhesive, and they performed signiﬁcantly
better in removing the dot 3 and 21 days after stroke
(Figure 5(c) and (d)).
A HomeCageScan monitoring system was used to
measure the animal activities in their home cage environment under unconstrained and no-stress environment
without human intervention. Behaviors such as walk,
jump, and turn were monitored for 12 hrs for oﬀ-line
analysis. Measured at 3 days after stroke, stroke control
animals spent signiﬁcantly less time in walking, hanging,
jumping, rearing, and coming down behaviors; there was
also a trend of less time in turning compared with sham
animals, Apelin-13 treatment reversed the above behaviors to the level of sham animals (Figure 6(a) to (f)).
Anxiety-related behaviors such as the number of entry
into the center area in an open ﬁeld and walking activity
were recorded for 1 hr using a TopScan monitoring
system. Stroke control animals showed the reduced
travel distance, slower movement, fewer entries to the
center area, and less time spent in the center area, suggesting a certain degree of increased anxiety after ischemia injury while the walking activity was also reduced.
Intranasal delivery of apelin-13 signiﬁcantly ameliorated
these abnormal behaviors after stroke (Figure 6(g) to (j)).

Discussion
The present investigation evaluated the neuroprotective
eﬀect of intranasal delivery of apelin-13 and related
mechanism against ischemic stroke in a mouse model of
focal cerebral ischemia, explored long-term regenerative
eﬀects on angiogenesis and functional recovery after
stroke. Our results demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that
the neuroprotectant apelin-13 can be administered
through the noninvasive intranasal delivery method,
and this treatment eﬀectively enhances the apelin level
in the ischemic brain, reduces the microglia activation,
attenuates inﬂammatory cytokines/chemokines levels,
and decreases the apoptotic cell death. The results suggest
that apelin-13 could be used as a neuroprotective as well
as a regenerative treatment after ischemic stroke. Apelin13 was given acutely after stroke and followed by chronic
treatment of daily administration. This treatment protocol was designed based on the rationale that the noninvasive method of intranasal administration can be
performed on-site to patients without much delay. The

Figure 5. Apelin-13 promoted the long-term LCBF restoration and functional recovery after stroke. (a and b) Local cerebral blood flow
(LCBF) in the penumbra region was measured at 21 days after stroke using Laser Doppler. The Laser Doppler imaging and quantified data

functional recovery was also examined at 3 and 21 days after stroke using adhesive removal test. Stroke control animals spent longer time

performed significantly faster in removing the sticky dot compared with stroke control animals. *p < .05 versus stroke þ vehicle. n ¼ 5 in

repeated chronic treatment targets the time-dependent
regenerative process for lasting eﬀect of functional
recovery.
Recently, the neuroprotective eﬀect of apelin administered through lateral cerebral ventricle injection was
reported in a rat transient focal ischemia model and in
a mouse neonatal hypoxia/ischemia encephalopathy
model (Khaksari et al., 2012; Gu et al., 2013). In seeking
for a noninvasive method to deliver apelin as a clinically
feasible treatment for ischemic stroke, the intranasal
route is an attractive and practical method. Drugs delivered through the intranasal route can bypass BBB and
reach brain tissues by utilizing the olfactory neuronal
pathways in the cribriform plate, which leads to direct
nose-to-brain distribution. Previous studies have shown
the eﬃcacy of intranasal administration of proteins and
peptides to the brain (Hanson and Frey, 2008; Dhuria
et al., 2010; Scaﬁdi et al., 2014). The intranasal drug
delivery is highly eﬃcient. The brain concentrations of
proteins and peptides after intranasal delivery are similar
or even higher comparing with systemic administration
(Scaﬁdi et al., 2014). We showed recently that intranasal
delivery is also an eﬀective method in stem cell transplantation therapy after ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke (Wei et al., 2013, 2015; Sun et al., 2015).
Intranasally administered bone marrow mesenchymal

stem cells were detected 1.5 hr later in the brain, and
many cells migrated to the ischemic cortex (Wei et al.,
2013). In the present study, 30 min after intranasal delivery of apelin-13 resulted in signiﬁcant high levels of apelin
in the brain detected in the ipsilateral cortex of stroke
animals. These results suggest that apelin-13, as many
proteins, peptides, and cells, can enter the postischemic
brain via the intranasal route. Endogenous apelin is also
expressed in other brain regions such as hippocampus,
hypothalamus, thalamus, basal ganglia, and contralateral
cortex. We did not see signiﬁcant eﬀect of apelin-13 treatment on apelin expression in these brain regions (data not
shown).
To increase tissue permeability, hyaluronidase was
administered to the nasal space 30 min prior to apelin13 administration. The use of hyaluronidase has
become a routine procedure in intranasal delivery of
therapeutics. A possible drug–drug interaction between
hyaluronidase and apelin-13 cannot be excluded.
However, this possibility is unlikely because hyaluronidase was given many minutes before apelin-13. In the
absence of hyaluronidase, apelin-13 has been shown to
have similar neuroprotective eﬀect in vitro and in vivo
(O’Donnell et al., 2007; Zeng et al., 2010; Khaksari
et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2015). It is
also important to note that intranasal delivery can be

and TopScan (g to j) behavioral monitoring system at 3 days after stroke. The 12-hr HomeCageScan monitoring results showed that stroke
animals showed significantly less time in walking, hanging, jumping, rearing, coming down, and a trend in reduced turning behavior. And 1-hr
TopScan open-field monitoring results showed a shorter travel distance, reduced velocity, fewer entries into the center area, and less time
spent in the center in the stroke control group. Apelin-13-treated animals showed a similar behavior as sham animals. *p < .05 versus sham,

performed in conscious animals or humans as shown in
this study without the need of anesthetics. This makes the
method even more clinically practical with reduced risk of
side eﬀects from repeated anesthesia.

Apoptosis have been linked to neuronal death after
ischemic stroke, trauma, spinal cord injury, and some
neurodegenerative diseases. It was reported that apelin13 upregulated the expression of survival gene Bcl-2 and

downregulated caspase-3 activity in cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation (Zhang et al., 2009).
Our previous in vitro study also showed that apelin-13
blocked serum deprivation-induced cell death, mitochondria depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3
activation (Zeng et al., 2010). In the present study on
stroke animals, elevated caspase-3 activation was
observed in the ischemic brain at 3 days after stroke.
Intranasal administration of apelin-13 signiﬁcantly suppressed the caspase-3 activation and increased the survival gene Bcl-2 after stroke, providing an antiapoptotic
mechanism of apelin-13 in the ischemic brain (Tang et al.,
2007; Zeng et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2014).
Endangered neurons insulted by ischemia synthesize
and release chemokines such as MCP-1, MIP-1a, and
interferon-inducible protein, which can recruit microglia
(Flugel et al., 2001; Rappert et al., 2004; Wang et al.,
2008). Increased MCP-1 and MIP-1a was detected in
neurons after ischemia (Che et al., 2001; Wang et al.,
2008). Although the mechanisms of chemokine-mediated
neuronal death are still under investigation, accumulating
evidence suggests that early production of proinﬂammatory mediators such as TNF-a and IL-1b through the
induction of chemokines contribute to ischemic cell
death (Barone et al., 1997; Yamashita et al., 2000;
Douglas et al., 2013). In the current study, we observed
that the expressions of chemokines, such as MCP-1 and
MIP-1a and proinﬂammatory cytokines including TNF-a
and IL-1b were diminished by apelin-13 treatment. On
the other hand, the antiapoptotic cytokine IL-10 was
increased by apelin-13. These ﬁndings suggest that
apelin-13 treatment prevents inﬂammation-mediated
neuronal damages through regulations of inﬂammatory
factors and activation of microglia cells after an ischemic
insult.
In the present investigation, we show that apelin-13
also facilitates regenerative activities in the ischemic
brain. Chronic treatment of apelin-13 increased the
angiogenesis and promoted the LCBF restoration and
long-term functional recovery after stroke. The improved
blood ﬂow recovery and behavioral recovery is expected
to be a result of the combined beneﬁts from neuroprotection and regeneration. Apelin-13 was given every day
starting from 30 min after stroke. This experimental
design targets to protect cells as well as promote persistent regeneration in the poststroke brain. Whether shorter
duration of apelin-13 treatment, and the dose-response
relationship or the time course of alterations of related
factors need to be determined in a systemic preclinical
study on the same and diﬀerent stroke models.
Previous reports showed that overexpression of apelin
increased Sirt3, VEGF/VEGFR2, and angiopoietin-1
(Ang-1)/Tie-2 expression and the density of capillary
and arteriole density in the heart of diabetic mice (Zeng
et al., 2014). On the other hand, inhibition of apelin

expression switched endothelial cells from proliferative
to mature state in pathological retinal angiogenesis
(Kasai et al., 2013). We now demonstrate a proangiogenic role of apelin after focal ischemic stroke. The
increased collagen IV expression has been shown to contribute the NO-induced angiogenesis (Wang and Su,
2011). Although we did not measure NO expression/
release, the increased expression of VEGF and MMP9
in apelin-13-treated animals is in line with enhanced
angiogenesis and the long-term functional recovery in
apelin-13-treated animals.
In conclusion, our study shows the anti-inﬂammatory,
antiapoptotic, and proregenerative actions of apelin-13,
which can be delivered by a noninvasive, clinical feasible
method of intranasal administration. For the ﬁrst time,
apelin-13 was shown to promote the angiogenesis and
LCBF restoration after ischemic stroke, indicating the
potential application of apelin-13 as a multifaceted drug
for acute and chronic treatments of ischemic stroke.
