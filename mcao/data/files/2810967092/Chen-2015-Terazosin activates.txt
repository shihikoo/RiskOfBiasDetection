Drugs that can protect against organ damage are urgently needed, especially for diseases such as sepsis and brain stroke. We
discovered that terazosin (TZ), a widely marketed 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, alleviated organ damage and improved
survival in rodent models of stroke and sepsis. Through combined studies of enzymology and X-ray crystallography, we discovered that TZ binds a new target, phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Pgk1), and activates its enzymatic activity, probably through
2,4-diamino-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline′s ability to promote ATP release from Pgk1. Mechanistically, the ATP generated from
Pgk1 may enhance the chaperone activity of Hsp90, an ATPase known to associate with Pgk1. Upon activation, Hsp90 promotes
multistress resistance. Our studies demonstrate that TZ has a new protein target, Pgk1, and reveal its corresponding biological
effect. As a clinical drug, TZ may be quickly translated into treatments for diseases including stroke and sepsis.

S

ymptoms of a wide variety of human diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases, heart failure, stroke
and sepsis, are caused by the overwhelming activation of cell
death and tissue damage. Sepsis, for example, is initiated by bacterial infection, which triggers massive apoptosis in immune systems
and the failure of multiple organ functions1. However, the clinical
treatment of sepsis has extensively relied on antimicrobial treatment
and supportive care, which have limited efficacy owing to complications such as drug resistance, antibiotic toxicity, endotoxins, cell
death and organ dysfunction2,3. Similarly, brain stroke, an agerelated vascular disease involving massive cell death in the brain, is
another leading cause of death worldwide. Currently, no effective
neuroprotective therapy has been developed beyond thrombolytic
therapy to restore clotted blood vessels4.
Apoptosis, which is mediated by caspases, was discovered in the
1990s5. Since then, no caspase inhibitor has passed clinical trials,
and the discovery of new inhibitors remains a major challenge in
biomedical research6. To manipulate apoptosis, efforts have been
focused on the endogenous regulatory factors, including the inhibitor of apoptosis family proteins, Bcl-2 family proteins and chaperone
proteins7,8. For example, the inhibitor of apoptosis family proteins
are heavily pursued drug targets for cancer therapeutics9. Hsp90,
a taxonomically highly conserved chaperone, has been reported
to have important roles in the regulation of cellular homeostasis
and stress response10. It has been reported that Hsp90 has many
biologically important client proteins, especially kinases and hormone receptors11,12. Hsp90 is highly dynamic, and its conformational change is regulated by its ATPase activity, which stabilizes its
interactions with client proteins10. Considering its prominent antiapoptotic and protective effects in cancer cells, many Hsp90 inhibitors have been developed as potential anticancer drugs to attenuate
cancer cell survival. However, no Hsp90 activator that may protect
cells from stresses and cell death has been reported.

Here, we devised a screen to search for new antiapoptotic drugs
from a pool of bioactive small molecules13. Once a candidate compound is identified, investigations of its targets and mode of action
may enable its rapid translation to clinical applications. We found
that TZ could rescue rodent models of sepsis and stoke in vivo.
Notably, it inhibited apoptosis in macrophages, most likely through
activation of Pgk1 and Hsp90.

RESULTS
TZ rescued reaper-mediated apoptosis in Drosophila

We designed our search for apoptosis inhibitors in Drosophila on
the rationale that its apoptotic pathway is conserved in mammals14
and that flies are economical for compound screening. To induce
apoptosis, the expression of reaper (rpr) was driven by a heatactivated promoter, HS-Gal4 (we refer to their progeny as HS>rpr).
Consistent with the previous report that ectopically expressed rpr
can induce widespread apoptosis and organ death in Drosophila15,
we observed that approximately 75% of the progeny was dead after
24 h upon heat shock at 37 °C for 45 min (Supplementary Results,
Supplementary Fig. 1a,b).
To screen for apoptosis inhibitors, we first assessed global transcriptional alteration during apoptosis using Affymetrix microarrays.
Comparing the HS>rpr flies to the genetic background–matched control HS × y w67c23 flies (progeny of HS-Gal4 flies crossed with y w67c23
flies), 2,169 genes showed more than 50% altered expression levels
(genes identified from the microarrays are listed in Supplementary
Data Set 1). Then, these genes were converted to homologous
human genes (the apoptotic signature genes after conversion
into human homologs are listed in Supplementary Data Set 2)
and entered into Cmap for compound matching13 (matched drugs
are listed in Supplementary Data Set 3). Twenty-five compounds
were selected (Supplementary Data Set 4) and were fed to the
HS>rpr flies with the concentrations indicated in Supplementary

TZ was an activator of Pgk1

To test whether the effect of TZ on apoptosis was mediated through
the α1-adrenergic receptor, we modified TZ by replacing a nitrogen
positioned on the quinazoline ring with a carbon (Fig. 2a; TZ-md, 2),
which is known to reduce its binding to the α1-adrenoceptor by
approximately 1,000-fold17. Indeed, TZ-md could not block intracellular calcium elevation induced by metaraninol, an α1 receptor
agonist (Supplementary Fig. 3a). However, TZ-md still had an
antiapoptotic effect in RAW 264.7 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b).
This result suggested that TZ might exert an antiapoptotic effect via
an unknown target.
To search for potential new targets, we synthesized a TZ
derivative, ‘TZ-TA’ (3), by conjugating a chemical handle at the
4-amino position of the quinazoline motif (Fig. 2a). TZ-TA
had preserved the antiapoptotic property of TZ in RAW 264.7
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Then, TZ-TA was immobilized
onto an Affi-Gel support to immobilize any binding proteins
(Supplementary Note 1). Comparing the pulldown results from
the RAW 264.7 cell lysate and the lysate containing saturated TZ as
a soluble competitor, we observed a distinct protein band specifically bound to the Affi-Gel–TZ-TA beads, with a molecular weight
of ~46 kDa (Fig. 2b). This band was extracted and identified by
MS as Pgk1 (Supplementary Fig. 3c and Supplementary Note 2).
Moreover, the purified His-tagged mouse Pgk1 could be pulled
down by the Affi-Gel–TZ-TA beads (Fig. 2c), suggesting that TZ
directly bound Pgk1.
As one of the core enzymes in glycolysis, Pgk1 had been reported
to act as a suppressor of apoptosis in yeast and improve the viability in the human SH-SY5Y cell line upon amyloid stimulus18,19.
To test the effect of TZ on Pgk1 activity, we performed an in vitro
assay by providing the purified Pgk1 with substrates (ADP and
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate) and measured the forward reaction in
which NADH accumulated (Online Methods). Notably, at higher
dosages (2.5 μM and 25 μM), TZ inhibited Pgk1, whereas at lower
dosages (0.5 μM to 2.5 nM) it activated Pgk1 (Fig. 2d). To further
validate the TZ effect on Pgk1, we measured ATP (a product of
Pgk1) and pyruvate (a downstream product of glycolysis) levels in
the cell lysate. The ATP level was transiently elevated by nearly 40%
in the first minute of the reaction, and the pyruvate level was stably
increased by approximately 30% (Fig. 2e). Together, these results
suggested that TZ activated Pgk1 at low concentrations.
Furthermore, we determined the effective dosages of TZ
to inhibit H2O2-induced apoptosis in macrophages. The results

To examine whether TZ inhibits apoptosis in cultured mammalian
cells, RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated for 18–24 h before induction
of apoptosis by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)16.
After treatment for 18–24 h, apoptosis was determined by annexin V
staining. The result showed that TZ suppressed apoptosis in these cells
(Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2a), and these results were further
verified by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay (Supplementary
Fig. 2b). Furthermore, to test whether TZ blocks apoptosis induced
by a different stressor, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was applied, which
induces caspase-mediated apoptosis, a type of cell death that can be
blocked by zVad, a pan-caspase inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. 2c).
Again, TZ exhibited a protective effect against H2O2-induced apoptosis by an LDH release assay (Fig. 1b), active caspase-3 western
blot (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2d) and caspase activity assay
(Fig. 1d). These results demonstrated that TZ inhibited caspasemediated apoptosis triggered by diverse inducers in macrophages.

showed that TZ suppressed apoptosis with concentrations as low
as 0.1 μM (Supplementary Fig. 4a).
To further explore the functional role of Pgk1 in modulating
apoptosis, we knocked down Pgk1 in RAW 264.7 cells by stably
expressing Pgk1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA). The knockdown efficiency was shown (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Although knocking
down Pgk1 did not affect cell survival, the protective effect of TZ
against H2O2-induced apoptosis was abolished by the Pgk1 shRNA,
as determined by LDH release assays (Fig. 2f); caspase 3 activation and PARP-1 cleavage were determined by western blotting
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). These results indicated that the antiapoptosis activity of TZ required Pgk1. Consistently, stable expression
of Pgk1 in the RAW 264.7 cells by lentiviral transfection reduced
PARP-1 cleavage and LDH release after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2g,
and Supplementary Fig. 4d,e). Collectively, these results indicated
that Pgk1 was required for the protective effect of TZ.

Crystallization of Pgk1 with TZ

To investigate how TZ interacts with Pgk1, we crystallized mouse
and human Pgk1 (Supplementary Fig. 5 shows protein purification of Pgk1). Pgk1 consists of N-terminal and C-terminal domains
of roughly equal size and a similar Rossman fold. Human Pgk1
(hPgk1) has been crystallized in open20 and closed21 forms. The
enzyme spends most of its time in a fully open and resting conformation for substrate binding and product release, with a short
period of time in a closed form, which is used for quick catalysis22.
Although the mPgk2 structure has been resolved23, there have been
no reports on mPgk1 structure. First, we grew mPgk1 crystals in

TZ

To examine the effect of TZ in vivo, we first
studied several stress conditions, including
hypoxia, oxidative stress and apoptosis in
Drosophila, with the rationale that Hsp90 activation induced by TZ may promote multistress
resistance. To induce hypoxia, fly larvae were
immersed in Drosophila HL3 saline for 2 h, and
then their lethality was determined 6 h later
after reoxygenation. The result showed that TZ
reduced lethality in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Fig. 9a). For oxidative stress,
we determined the lethality induced by feeding
the flies with 20 mM paraquat. The results

demonstrated that TZ (10 μM) was protective against paraquat
(Fig. 5a). Moreover, the expression of Pgk1 RNAi or Hsp83 (the
Drosophila homolog of mammalian Hsp90) RNAi, which effectively
knocked down the targeted transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 9b),
abolished the TZ effect (Fig. 5a), suggesting that the TZ effect was
dependent on Pgk1 and Hsp83. In contrast, overexpression of Pgk1

deficiency in humans causes muscle stiffness, hemolytic anemia and
mental retardation37, whereas the overexpression of Pgk1 renders a
multi-drug-resistant phenotype in human ovarian cancer cells or
the progression of hepatic carcinoma38,39.
Regarding the mechanism of TZ activation of Pgk1, our cocrystal structure data from both the mouse and the human Pgk1
with TZ suggested that the 2,4-diamino-6,7-dimethoxyisoquinoline
structural motif fits into the pocket of the ADP or ATP binding
site. Because ATP release is likely to be a key rate-limiting step for
the enzymatic reaction40, TZ may kinetically facilitate the reaction
through accelerating ATP release. However, the binding affinity of
TZ to Pgk1 was approximately tenfold higher than the substrate
ADP, and therefore the concentration of TZ needs to be sufficiently
low for ADP to compete off TZ for the next catalytic cycle.
Our mechanistic studies suggested that activated Pgk1 might promote the ATPase activity of Hsp90. Under basal conditions, Hsp90
is known to have a very low ATPase activity41, and activation of its
ATPase can enhance its interaction with client proteins8. Hsp90 is
a well-known inhibitor of caspase-mediated apoptosis through
diverse mechanisms. For instance, Hsp90 may interact with Apaf-1
to prevent the formation of the apoptosome42 or prevent Bid cleavage43. Activated Hsp90 may also promote prosurvival pathways by
increasing NF-κB activity or by maintaining Akt kinase activity44,45.
Consistent with our hypothesis, Hsp90 has been shown to protect
mice from LPS-induced sepsis46. Although our results suggest that
TZ may enhance the ATPase activity of Hsp90, this observation is
indirect and so warrants further investigation.
Different from of our hypothesis, some studies have suggested
that the administration of some Hsp90 inhibitors such as GA and
17-AAG were protective against sepsis47,48. However, these inhibitors were also known to activate the function of HSF-1 through
inactivation of Hsp90 to release HSF-1 (refs. 28, 49). The effect of
TZ on Hsp90 activation warrants further investigation, especially
during sepsis and stroke.
The discovery of TZ as a new protective agent and Pgk1 as a new
target has great potential to be implemented in many medical conditions to protect cells from damage. The fact that TZ is an approved
drug with well-established pharmacokinetic and safety profiles in
humans may accelerate its potential development and repurposing
as a new clinical drug.

ONLINE METHODS

Fly stocks and compound screen. UAS-rpr and HS-Gal4 flies were obtained
from Bloomington Stock Center. The F1 progenies (HS>rpr) from the cross
of these two lines were raised at 18 °C for the compound screen. The Pgk1
transgenic fly was generated using a pUAST vector. For the compound screen,
chemicals (purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz; the purity of each chemical was shown in Supplementary Data Set 4) were dissolved in 5% sucrose at
the concentrations listed in the Cmap. The compound solution (150 μl) was
added to a vial containing three layers of filter papers. Twenty adult HS>rpr
flies aged 1–3 d were then placed into each vial for 24 h. Expression of rpr was
subsequently induced by placing the vials in a 37 °C incubator for 45 min.
These flies were then placed at 25 °C for another 24 h before calculation of the
survival rate.

Western blotting and co-IP. Proteins were extracted with RIPA buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate and
1 mM EDTA), and then protease inhibitors were added (Roche). After
disrupting on ice for 30 min, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000g and
boiled with SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min.
For the co-IP experiment, Pgk1-HA was transfected in the RAW264.7 cells for
36 h. The cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 130 mM
NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.25% Triton X-100 and
protease inhibitors). After centrifugation at 13,000g for 10 min at 4 °C, the
supernatant was incubated with HA antibody or control IgG at 4 °C overnight.
The protein A/G-agarose beads were added to precipitate the complexes. After
washing with lysis buffer six times, the agarose beads were boiled in a 2× SDS
loading buffer. For endogenous co-IP, the same sample preparation protocol
was followed.
Activity assay of caspase 3/7. Cell lysates were analyzed with a caspase-GloR
3/7 Assay kit (Promega).

Microarray processing and data analysis. Ten vials of HS>rpr flies and progeny of HS-Gal4 and yw67c23 (a genetic background–matched control line)
aged 1–3 d were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen before heat shock
(as time 0), and after heat shock at 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 7 h, 8 h and 12 h.
Total RNA was prepared by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Drosophila 2.0 DNA
microarrays from Affymetrix were used (Affymetrix). Data analysis was
performed using the Arrayassist 5.0 (Affymetrix). The algorithm of ‘RMA’
was used to analyze the data. The fold changes of transcripts were listed in
Supplementary Table 1.

Target identification of TZ with affinity chromatography. RAW 264.7 cells
were sonicated in modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mM
NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate and 1 mM EDTA) supplemented
with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). For the control experiment, 50 μl of
naked Affi-Gel 102 (Bio-Rad) beads were added to 1 ml of 4 mg/ml cytosolic
extracts. For the soluble competitor experiment, 10 mg of TZ was incubated
with 1 ml of cell lysates for 1 h before being combined with 50 μl of TZ-TA
immobilized Affi-Gel (Affi-Gel–TZ-TA). For the bait beads experiment, 50 μl
of Affi-Gel–TZ-TA was directly incubated with 1 ml of cell lysates. The incubation lasted overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed with the RIPA buffer
three times. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 0.1% SDS and
were analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by Coomassie brilliant
blue staining.

Exploration of candidate compounds by Cmap. We converted upregulated
and downregulated genes from the Drosophila microarray to mammalian
homologous genes based on an online database (http://www.affymetrix.com/)
(Supplementary Table 2). The signature files were then generated on the
basis of the protocol provided by Cmap, and the list of predicted compounds
with the best positive or negative correlations was generated (Supplementary
Table 3). The 25 tested compounds are listed in Supplementary Table 4, and
their concentrations used in the microarrays are listed in Supplementary
Table 5.

MS analysis. The bands on the protein gels were excised and digested using the
standard tryptic digestion method (from ABRF). The peptides from digestion
were analyzed on an LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).
The analytical reverse phase column was 100 μm (ID) × 8 cm (length) with a
pulled tip, packed with 3 μm, 125 Å Aqua C18 resin (Phenomenex). Gradients
from 5% to 80% of ACN were used. The MS2 data was acquired in datadependent mode, as one full scan followed by eight CID MS2 scans for the top
eight peaks. The MS2 spectra were searched against an NCBI-mouse database
using Prolucid and filtered with DTASelect2.

Cell culture and apoptosis induction. The RAW 264.7 cells and 293T cells were
cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco),
streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) and penicillin (0.06 mg/ml) (Gibco). To induce
apoptosis, RAW 264.7 cells at 40% confluence were incubated in DMEM
(10% FBS) containing 2 μg/ml LPS (2 μg/ml LPS; Escherichia coli O111:B4,
Sigma-Aldrich, >500,000 EU/mg) and mouse IFN-γ in 0.1% DMSO (50 U/ml,
Peprotech, ≥98%), or LPS and IFN-γ plus TZ in 0.1% DMSO (10 μM) for 18 h
to 30 h. For H2O2 treatment, the final concentration of H2O2 was 1 mM. For GA
(Biovision, ≥99%) treatment, the concentration was 10 nM. Z-Val-Ala-D/L-Asp
(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (Z-vad, Bachem) was used at the final concentration of 100 μM.

Measurement of intracellular calcium level. The intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured using the Fura-2 staining kit (Invitrogen). Cells
were loaded with Fura 2-a.m. (2 μM) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark and then
washed three times in standard external solution (141 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl,
2.4 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM HEPES and 11 mM
glucose). Imaging was performed on an inverted Olympus microscope, and
Fura-2 was excited at 340 nm and 380 nm. The emission was then collected
with a 480- to 540-nm bandpass filter. The 340 nm/380 nm ratio was calculated and normalized to the baseline ratio at the beginning of the experiment.
The Ca2+ signals are plotted as relative Fura-2 intensity, which denotes the
340 nm/380 nm ratio (background intensity was subtracted). Metaraminol
(Sigma, ≥98%) was used at 200 μM. TZ and TZ-md were used at 4 μg/ml.

Drugs. Terazosin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (T4680).
Annexin V staining and analysis in the RAW 264.7 cells. After incubating
with LPS and IFN-γ, the cells were stained with anti–annexin V antibody
(Invitrogen) for 15 min. The cells were then washed once with annexinbinding buffer and imaged with a confocal microscope (TCS SP5, Leica).
The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of annexin
V–positive cells to the number of total cells.
LDH assay. The LDH assay (Promega) was performed according to the
manufacturer′s instructions with minor modifications. Cells were plated
in 96-well plates and treated as indicated in Figures 1b, 2f and 4c and
Supplementary Figures 2b, 3b and 4a–e for 24 h. LDH levels in both
medium and cells were measured. The absorbance at 490 nm was obtained
from SpectraMax M2 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). The cytotoxicity is calculated as LDHmedium/(LDHmedium + LDHcell).

Pgk1 activity assay. To induce Pgk1 expression in vitro, mouse Pgk1 cDNA
was cloned into a pEASYTM-E2 vector containing a His tag (TransGen Biotech).
Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG in BL21 (DE3) chemically
competent cells (TransGen Biotech). After the cells were lysed in an extraction buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole,
5% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.9), the supernatant was purified
with nickel beads (AdarBiotech). Elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate,
500 mM NaCl, 80 mM imidazole, protease inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.9) was used
to elute His-tagged Pgk1.
To measure the Pgk1 activity, a saturated amount of the substrates
(1.6 mM GAP, 1 mM β-NAD, 1 mM ADP and 20 ng/μl GAPDH) was mixed
with purified recombinant mouse Pgk1-His protein (2 μg/ml), and the reaction was conducted in buffer (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgSO4,
10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM DTT at pH 8.6). The forward reaction of Pgk1 can
lead to a reduction of ADP level, and this will promote GAPDH to produce
doi:10.1038/nchembio.1657

more NADH. NADH can be detected at an absorbance wavelength of 339 nm.
Therefore, the levels of relative NADH changes to the baseline can indicate
Pgk1 activity.

Affinity assay of TZ and Pgk1. To examine whether TZ and Pgk1 bind directly,
naked Affi-Gel, Affi-Gel–TZ-TA with competitor TZ or Affi-Gel–TZ-TA
alone was incubated with His-tagged Pgk1 overnight at 4 °C. The proteins on
the beads were eluted and analyzed on a 15% SDS-PAGE.
Cloning expression and purification. Recombinant mPgk1 was produced in
BL21 E. coli cells harboring the mPgk1-PET28a expression plasmid with a TEV
cleavage sequence inserted. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG
overnight at 16 °C. After the cells were lysed in the extraction buffer (20 mM
sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol, pH 7.9), the
supernatant was loaded onto a nickel affinity column (GE Healthcare) and
washed with the buffer containing 10 mM imidazole. The bound protein to
the column was eluted using 100 mM imidazole in the same buffer. The elution was then mixed with TEV enzyme and dialyzed in the buffer containing
20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.9. After dialysis, the nickel
affinity column was used to remove the peptide with the His tag and the
TEV sequence. The mPgk1 without the His tag was concentrated and further
purified by size-exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare), and final fractions containing pure mPgk1 in the buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0,
100 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT were pooled and concentrated to 20–30 mg/ml.
Crystallization. The mPgk1–3PG crystals were crystallized at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method from 25–30% PEG 4000
0.2 M sodium acetate trihydrate and 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The drop contained 1 μl of the protein solution mixed with 2 μl of the reservoir solution. The
protein solution (10 mg/ml) consisting of Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, contained 25 mM
MgCl2, 50 mM PG, 10 mM DTT and 0.02% NaN3.
To obtain the Pgk1–3PG–TZ complex, both co-crystallization and soaking methods were used. The mPgk1–3PG–TZ co-crystals were grown from
the same crystallization condition described previously. The protein solution
contained the same components as mPgk1–3PG solution, with the addition
of 10 mM TZ. Meanwhile, hPgk1–3PG–TZ co-crystals were obtained from
25–30% PEG 4000, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. To ensure complex formation,
mPgk1–3PG crystals were soaked in the buffer containing 30% PEG 4000 0.1M
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mM MgCl2, 50 mM PG and 10 mM TZ.
Cryoprotection. Crystallization buffer contained 30% PEG 4,000, which was
sufficient for cryoprotection in both human and mouse Pgk. Therefore, no
additional cryoprotectant was needed to freeze the crystals. Individual crystals
were mounted in a cryoloop (Hampton), followed by flash cooling in liquid
nitrogen for data collection.
Data collection and refinement of crystal structures. Diffraction data of
mPgk1–3PG–TZ was collected from cryo-cooled crystals to a resolution of
2.1 Å (Supplementary Table 2) at the KEK Photon Factory Synchrotron
located in Japan, using the BL17A beamline using the Q270 X-ray diffractometer. Diffraction data for hPgk1–3PG–TZ was collected at the Shanghai
Synchrotron Radiation Facility, BL17U1 beamline, with a resolution of 2.1 Å
(Structure Statistic Table, Supplementary Data Set 6). Data were processed
with the program HKL2000, and molecular replacement was carried out using
MolRep in the CCP4 Program Suite. The search model for the mPgk1–3PG–TZ structure has PDB code 3C39, and the structure with PDB code 2XE6
was used to determine hPgk1–3PG–TZ structure. Refinement was performed
in PHENIX with rigid body refinement and alternating cycles of TLS, positional, and individual B-factor refinement. The resulting model was manually
inspected and modified with the program COOT.
ITC. The raw heat values were measured over a series of injections of TZ or
TZ-TA into mPgk1 at 25 °C by MicroCal iTC200 (GE Healthcare).
RT-qPCR. The method for qRT-PCR followed the ‘relative study’ standard
protocol from Applied Biosystem (7500 real-time PCR system, ABI Inc.). Actin
was used as a reference for total RNA quantity.
Lentivirus package. The coding sequences of EGFP and mouse Pgk1 were
amplified by PCR and separately cloned into the pLentiCMVMCSSVBsd vector.
doi:10.1038/nchembio.1657

Lenti-EGFP and Lenti-Pgk-1 viruses were produced by cotransfection with
the VSV-G/pMD2G and pCMV-dR8.74 plasmids into the packaging cell line
HEK 293T by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The shRNA lentiviruses were
packaged in a similar fashion.
Infection of cells and mice with lentivirus. RAW264.7 cells were incubated
with the virus and the polybrene (8 μg/ml) overnight. On second day, stable
cell lines were selected in a growth medium supplemented with 5–10 μg/ml
blasticidin for 1 week. To infect a mouse, 2 × 107 infection units (IU) of virus
were diluted in 200 μl saline and injected (subcutaneous) twice on day 1 and 4
before CLP. One week later, the mice were subjected to CLP.
Detection of ATP and pyruvate in cell lysate and mouse tissue. The ATP level
was detected using the kit from Promega. The cell lysates from RAW 264.7 cells
were prepared as described previously. After adding DMSO or TZ (10 μM)
into the cell lysates, the total ATP in the reaction system was detected immediately or 10 min after the reaction system was established. For the GA treatment,
it was added directly into the reaction system, and the final concentration was
100 μM. Pyruvate measurement was followed a protocol from a kit (EnzyChrom
pyruvate Assay Kit, BioAssay Systems).
Drosophila hypoxia assay. The third instar larvae were immersed in a
1.5-ml tube filled with HL3 saline for 2 h. Then, the saline was removed to
allow reoxygenation of the larvae. After 6 h recovery, their survival rate
was determined.
Drosophila oxidative stress assay. The wild type, UAS-Pgk1RNAi and UASHsp83RNAi flies were crossed with the Actin5c-Gal4 promoter line. Their progeny male flies were collected at age 1–3 d. The 20 flies then were put into a
testing vial containing 450 μl of solutions (20 mM paraquat in 5% of sucrose)
on three layers of filter papers. Their lethality was recorded each day for 4 d.
Mouse models of sepsis. Male BALB/C mice from the Vital River (Beijing,
China) were housed in the Animal Center of Peking University. The animal
studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) of the Peking University (Approve number: LSC-LiuL-1 and LSCLiuL-2). For the LPS model of sepsis, each mouse was injected with LPS
(13.5 mg per kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection) once. TZ (0.4 mg per
kg body weight) or saline was then injected (intraperitoneally) 1.5 h after LPS
infusion. Lethality was recorded every 12 h for 7 d.
For the CLP model of sepsis, mice were anesthetized with Avertin (240 mg
per kg body weight, intraperitoneally). Then, a 1.5- to 2.0-cm-long abdominal
midline incision was made, and the cecum was exposed. After ligation at 5 mm
from the cecal tip, the cecum was punctured once with a 22-gauge needle, and
about 1 mm of stool was squeezed out. TZ (0.08 mg per kg body weight) or
saline was injected after 1.5 h and 24 h after surgery. Lethality was recorded
every 12 h for 7 d.
Rat permanent MCAO model. We used adult male Sprague-Dawley rats
(250–270 g, Vital River, Beijing). The animal studies were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Peking University.
Briefly, a suture was inserted through the left external carotid artery of the
anesthetized rats. A laser Doppler blood flow monitor was used to ensure successful occlusion (>80% drop from prestroke baseline). Then, TZ or saline
(control) was injected intraperitoneally at a concentration of 0.08 mg per kg
body weight and 0.03 mg per kg body weight, respectively, 30 min before occlusion. The infarct volume was determined 4 h later by TTC staining (1%, at
37 °C for 15 min).
DNA fragmentation in mouse thymus. The thymi were collected from each
mouse, 6–48 h after CLP. The genomic DNA of thymus was then extracted with
a genomic DNA purification kit (Biofuture). DNA fragmentation was assessed
on a 1% agarose gel.
TUNEL assay. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Millipore).
Cytokine detection. Blood samples were collected from mice 6–48 h after LPS
infusion or CLP surgery. The samples were then incubated at room temperature for 45 min, and serum was obtained by centrifugation at 1,900g for 15 min.
nature CHEMICAL BIOLOGY

The serum samples were then analyzed by TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 ELISA kits
(Boster) and a mouse HMGB-1 ELISA kit (SUNBIO).

Statistical analyses. A one-way ANOVA test was used for group comparison
(Figs. 1b–d, 2d,f and 4a,c and Supplementary Figs. 1b, 2a,b, 3a,b, 4a,e, 8c,
9a,e, 10b, 11a–c, 12d, 13a,b and 14a). Student t-tests were used to compare
two data sets (Figs. 2e and 5d and Supplementary Fig. 9b). Kaplan-Meier
tests were used under the log-rank algorithm for survival analysis (Fig. 5c and
Supplementary Figs. 9c,d and 12c).

Pharmacokinetics of TZ. After intraperitoneal injection of TZ, blood or
tissue samples were collected at various time points. The tissues were ground
and sonicated in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl,
1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate and 1 mM EDTA). For the standard curve of TZ, 30 μl of TZ (200 nM) was added to a 100-μl blood sample
and mixed with 40 μl of 1 M NaOH. Then, 200 μl of acetic ether was added
and mixed for 2 min. After centrifugation at 2,000g for 3 min, the supernatant was harvested, and 200 μl of acetic ether was added again. Then, the

extracts were combined (600 μl of acetic ether total), and the samples were
analyzed by a WATERS UPLC system (Phenomenex Kinetex) coupled with
an AB API4000Q mass spectrometer. Mass signals were collected under
positive mode.
