Abstract The collapse of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is
one of the fundamental pathophysiology changes during cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. Resveratrol has been recently reported to reduce cerebral ischemic damage by regulating the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). But, more
direct evidence for the explanation of the BBB protected by
resveratrol against cerebral ischemia reperfusion is still lacking. Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the
regulation of BBB integrity by resveratrol after cerebral ischemia reperfusion and to determine the role of the MMP-9 and
its endogenous inhibitor TIMP-1 balance in this process.
Cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery
occlusion in rats. The BBB function was evaluated by brain
water content and the Evans blue dye extravasation; the activities of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were detected by using gelatin
zymography analysis, and cellular apoptosis was examined by
TUNEL staining. We confirmed that resveratrol reduced the
cerebral ischemia reperfusion damage, brain edema, and
Evans blue dye extravasation. Moreover, we found that resveratrol improved the balance of MMP-9/TIMP-1 in terms of
their expressions and activities. A TIMP-1 neutralizing antibody reversed those neuroprotective effects of resveratrol. In
conclusion, resveratrol attenuated the cerebral ischemia by

Introduction
Stroke has been causing a heavy burden on the society as the
world population keeps increasing and the incidence of stroke
remains high. The damage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
integrity is a key process during stroke and could lead to the
death of patients (Desilles et al. 2013). Reasonably, the attenuation of the BBB disruption is an essential target for treating
stroke. Resveratrol, a polyphenol, has many beneficial activities such as anti-aging (Marchal et al. 2013), anti-platelet
aggregation (Olas et al. 2008), and anti-inflammation (Rahal
et al. 2012) and is also protective on experimental cerebral
ischemia models (Sakata et al. 2010). However, the specific
neuroprotective mechanism of resveratrol remains unclear. It
was noted that resveratrol could reduce MMP-9 expression
(Cheng et al. 2009). MMP-9 degrades basal lamina and damages tight junctions which are important components of the
BBB (Rosenberg et al. 1998; Zlokovic 2008). While, TIMP1, the endogenous inhibitor of MMP-9 forms a 1:1 complex with MMP-9 leading to the MMP-9 activity inhibition
(Malemud 2006), which is related to the improvement of
cell survival in both in vivo and in vitro models of hypoxia
ischemia (Tan et al. 2003). As such, we tried to determine
that whether resveratrol is neuroprotective by alleviating
the dysfunction of BBB and to investigate the role of
TIMP-1 in this beneficial process.

Materials and Methods
Animals
All animal-related procedures were approved by the Ethics
committee for Animal Experimentation of Fourth Military
Medical University (Xi’an, China) and proceeded in accordance with the guidelines for animal experimentation of the
university, which were also in accordance with the guidelines
published in the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health
Publication No. 85-23, revised 1985), and the principles presented in the “Guidelines for the Use of Animals in
Neuroscience Research” by the Society for Neuroscience.
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 260±20 g were
maintained with a 12-h light/dark environment.
For the determination of the effect of resveratrol on cerebral
ischemia, animals were randomly divided into four groups:
sham, control, vehicle, and resveratrol. Rats were subjected to
transient focal cerebral ischemia by middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) as described previously (Belayev et al.
1999). At the onset of reperfusion, resveratrol was administrated intraperitoneally at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Then, neurological score, infarct volume, TUNEL staining, brain water
and Evans blue dye extravasation, the activity of MMP-9, and
TIMP-1 were analyzed 24 h post reperfusion. In order to
further testify the role of TIMP-1 in neuroprotection induced
by resveratrol, a neutralizing antibody was used to inhibit
TIMP-1 activity. Rats were randomly assigned into two
groups: resveratrol + IgG (group IgG) and resveratrol + neutralizing antibody (group neutralized). The neutralizing antibody and IgG were administrated intracerebroventricularly
15 min prior to MCAO in this experiment, respectively
(50 ng/kg). The dose of neutralizing antibody was based on
previous study (Souvenir et al. 2011).
Drugs and Reagents
Resveratrol was purchased from pharmaceutical and biological products (Beijing, China) and was dissolved in 5 % ethanol to a concentration of 50 mg/ml. The normal saline containing 5 % ethanol was used as vehicle. TIMP-1 neutralizing
antibody and IgG were purchased from AbD Serotec
(Raleigh, NC) and diluted in PBS to a concentration of
2 μg/ml.

873

Body temperature was maintained at 37±0.5 °C with a
heating pad controlled by a rectal probe. A laser Doppler flow
probe was attached to the right side of the dorsal surface of the
skull 2 mm caudal and 4 mm lateral to bregma. After 120 min
ischemia, the vessel was reperfused. A succeeding ischemia
and reperfusion injury was considered with an 80 % drop and
70 % recovery in regional cerebral blood flow.
Neurological Deficit Sore Assessment
According to a score system of Garcia et al. (Garcia et al.
1995), the neurological behavior was assessed 24 h post
reperfusion by an observer who was blind to the animal
grouping and presented as median with interquartile range.
Infarct Volume Evaluation
The infarct volume evaluation was as described before (Xiong
et al. 2003). After assessment of the neurological behavior,
animals were decapitated under deep anesthesia with overdose
sodium pentobarbital. Six slices of 2 mm thick coronal section
throughout the brain were stained in 2 % 2,3,5triphenylterazolium chloride (TTC) at 37 °C for 20 min.
Then, the slices were photographed with a digital camera
(Nikon, IXUS 220HS, Japan), and the infarct volume was
analyzed with a program Adobe Photoshop CS5. A relative
infarct volume was obtained with correction for edema as
100 %×(contralateral hemisphere volume−non-infarct ipsilateral hemisphere volume)/contralateral hemisphere volume.
The data was presented as mean±SEM.
Intracerebroventricular Injection
Rats were anesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus
(Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) following which the bregma point
was exposed. The injection point was located 1.8 mm lateral
and 1.5 mm posterior to the bregma in the right hemisphere. A
hole was carefully drilled at this point, and a 10-μl Hamilton
syringe (701, Hamilton Co., Reno, NV, USA) was fixed on the
stereotaxic apparatus and advanced vertically through this
point to a depth of 4.0 mm beneath the dural surface. The
infusing rate was 1 μl/min. The needle was removed slowly
within 5 min of initiating this process to prevent reflux.
Evaluation of the BBB Integrity

Focal Cerebral Ischemia and Reperfusion
The animals were fasted overnight but free access for tap
water before surgery. The cerebral ischemia was induced by
MCAO as described previously (Belayev et al. 1999). Rats
were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital intraperitoneally
at a dose of 60 mg/kg and autonomous respiration remaining.

The integrity of the BBB was evaluated by using Evans blue
extravasation. Evans blue (2 % in saline, 4 ml/kg) was injected
intravenously at 22 h after reperfusion. Rats were then perfused with saline through the left ventricle 2 h after injection.
The samples collection and measure protocol was following
the previous study (Belayev et al. 1998).

Measurement of Brain Water Content
Animals were euthanized to analyze brain water content at
24 h following ischemia as described (Khan et al. 2012). The
cortices, excluding the cerebellum, were quickly removed,
and the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres were separately weighed. Samples were dried at 60 °C for 72 h. Relative
water content was calculated in the ipsilateral hemisphere as:
water content (%)=(wet weight−dry weight)/wet weight×
100.

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 55:872–879

the sample was frozen and cut into 12 μm slices from approximately 2 mm rostral to bregma. Then, the slices were washed
with TBST, incubated with 0.3 % TritonX-100 for 5 min at
room temperature, and blocked with 5 % fetal bovine serum
and 3 % bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The primary
antibodies were MMP-9 antibody and TIMP-1 antibody
(1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). After incubating overnight at 4 °C, Alexa fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit
antibody (1:2000, Molecular Probes) was used for the fluorescence detection. The samples were captured with a microscope (OLYMPUS, BX51) through a program DP2-BSW.

TUNEL Staining
Gelatin Zymography
The cellular apoptosis was evaluated 24 h post reperfusion by an in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferasemediated 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate nick-end labeling assay (TUNEL Roche Diagnostics, Germany). For
TUNEL staining, rat brains were fixed and embedded in
paraffin block. The tissue was then cut into 4 μm coronal
sections from approximately 2 mm rostral to bregma. The
slices were stained as the manufacture’s instruction. The
positive cells were acquired by using a ×40 objective lens
in the ischemic penumbra, and the number of positive
cells was expressed as number per 100 μm2. The definition of ischemic penumbra area was described previously
(Ashwal et al. 1998).
Western Blot
Brain tissue corresponding to ischemic penumbra was
dissected. The sample was homogenized in a RIPA lysis
buffer (Beyotime, Nantong, China) containing whole proteinase inhibitor cocktail on ice. A BCA protein assay kit
(Beyotime, Nantong, China) was used to determine the
protein concentration. Equivalent amount of protein
(30 μg per lane) was loaded and separated by a 12 %
SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the protein was
transferred to a polyvinylidene difuoride membrane. The
membrane was blocked with 2 % bovine serum albumin
in TBST. Then, the membrane was incubated overnight at
4 °C with the following primary antibodies, anti-MMP-9,
anti-TIMP-1, and anti-GAPDH (1:1000, Abcam,
Cambridge, United Kingdom). At last, the membrane
was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000, Pierce,
Rockford, IL) for 1 h at room temperature. Analysis
software program ImageJ was used to quantify the optical
density of each band.
Immunofluorescence Staining
The brain sample was fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at
24 h post reperfusion. After dehydration with 30 % sucrose,

To determine the enzymatic activity of MMP-9 and TIMP-1,
gelatin zymography was performed 24 h post reperfusion. The
samples were applied on Novex Zymogram gel (Invitrogen,
CA, USA), and the gels were electrophoresed, developed, and
stained according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Lee et al.
2009).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 16.0 for windows. The neurological score was analyzed by Kruskal–
Wallis test followed with the Mann–Whitney U test. The
Bonferroni test was used as a correction. Other values were
analyzed by one-way ANOVA analysis followed with post
hoc Tukey test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Resveratrol Reduced Cerebral Ischemia
Compared with control group, resveratrol decreased the infarct volume (Fig. 1b, P<0.05, 33.00±2.760 % versus 43.29±
2.826 %) and improved the neurological score 24 h after
reperfusion (Fig. 1c, P<0.05). The vehicle had no effect on
the infarct volume (42.71±3.364 %), neurological score.
Moreover, resveratrol reduced the number of apoptotic cells
in the ischemic penumbra 24 h after reperfusion when compared with control group (Fig. 1e, P<0.05).

Resveratrol Improved the MMP-9/TIMP-1 Balance After
Cerebral Ischemia
The Western blotting results of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were
shown in Fig. 3a. Compared with sham group, both expressions
of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were increased after reperfusion as seen
in the control group (P<0.01). When treated with resveratrol,
MMP-9 expression was downregulated while TIMP-1 was
upregulated as compared with control group (P<0.05). The
immunofluorescence staining showed the same change as the
Western blotting (Fig. 3b). The gelatin zymography results of
MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were illustrated in Fig. 3c. Both activities
of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were increased after ischemic injury as
seen in control group (P<0.01), while resveratrol not only
inhibited MMP-9 activity but also increased TIMP-1 activity
when compared with control group (P<0.05).

Compared with IgG-treated group, TIMP-1 neutralization
increased the infarct volume (40.71±3.682 % versus 30.43
±2.534 %) and worsened the neurological score 24 h post
reperfusion (Fig. 5b, c, P<0.05). Moreover, the cellular
apoptosis was increased by TIMP-1 neutralization as compared with IgG-treated group 24 h after reperfusion

In the present study, we found that resveratrol reduced the
cerebral ischemic injury by alleviating the dysfunction of
BBB, and this beneficial effect was via regulation of the
TIMP-1 signal, as the administration of neutralizing antibody
of TIMP-1 dampened the neuroprotection of resveratrol, as
well as the prevention of cellular apoptosis. Thus, it can be
speculated that resveratrol therapy induces cerebral ischemic
tolerance by protection of the BBB through the TIMP-1
signal.
The BBB is a specialized lining of vascular endothelial
cells linked by continuous tight junctions in the brain

(Zlokovic 2008). Basal lamina forms a layer around the
endothelial cells, which provides a charge barrier and may
impede diffusion of larger molecules (Siflinger-Birnboim
et al. 1987). This unique anatomical barrier acts as a
physical and metabolic border between the brain tissue
and blood circulation. BBB integrity protects the neuronal
microenvironment (Abbott et al. 2006). Loss of BBB
integrity is an early critical event in ischemia and reperfusion injury, which contributes to the initiation of the
inflammatory cascades, edema formation, and ultimately
poor outcomes. Agents that can block BBB leakages have
been shown to protect the neurovascular unit against
ischemia (Chen et al. 2006).

MMPs are a gene family of neutral proteases that are important in normal development, wound healing, and a wide
variety of pathological processes, including the atherosclerosis
and neuroinflammation (Malemud 2006). In the central nervous system (CNS), MMPs, especially MMP-9, have been
shown to degrade components of the basal lamina and the
subsequent disruption of the BBB, resulting in brain hemorrhage and edema (Rosenberg 2002). MCAO with reperfusion
caused an opening of the BBB by increasing the level of MMP9 (Rosenberg et al. 1998). MMP-9 knockout mice have been
found to have less infarct size and less damage (Asahi et al.
2000). Plenty of evidence supports that the role of MMP-9 in
ischemic stroke is associated with the disruption of the BBB
(Dziembowska and Wlodarczyk 2012; Rosenberg et al. 1998).

Resveratrol is a polyphenol found in grapes and wine (Hao
and He 2004). Studies have shown that regular consumption
of red wine reduces the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (Hao and He 2004). Animal studies have indicated that resveratrol protects the heart, brain, and kidney from
ischemia reperfusion injury (Raval et al. 2008). In the subarachnoid hemorrhage model, resveratrol was found to improve the function outcomes by reduction of the BBB disruption, which may result from a lower expression of MMP-9
(Shao et al. 2013). Interestingly, modulation of MMP-9 activity by resveratrol during acute phases after stroke has been
demonstrated (Dong et al. 2008). This potent effect on MMP9 by resveratrol could also be seen in others’ studies based on
neuronal ischemia reperfusion injury (Cheng et al. 2009). It

878

has been reported that resveratrol could preserve the BBB
integrity in neurodegenerative disease or cerebral injury induced by oxidized LDL (Lin et al. 2010). Saha A et al found
that in a rat model of infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis,
resveratrol could reduce the differentiation of T(H)17 lymphocytes and the expression of MMPs, which might be the
mechanism of the improvement of BBB integrity by resveratrol in this model (Saha et al. 2012). While in the cerebral
injury induced by oxidized LDL, resveratrol reduced the BBB
damage by preserving the structure of tight junctions and
cellular structure of endothelia (Lin et al. 2010). In the present
study, we reported the beneficial effect of resveratrol on the
maintenance of BBB integrity for the first time in cerebral
ischemia reperfusion injury.
As active and latent MMPs are stringently regulated by
endogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMPs),
which, in general, broadly inhibit the activities of MMPs. A
balanced interaction between TIMP-1 and MMP-9 has been
clearly demonstrated to associate with the brain infarct reduction and the BBB function improvement (Brew et al. 2000).
TIMP-1 inhibits MMP-9 activity through the high-affinity and
noncovalent binding to the MMP catalytic domain under
physiological and pathological conditions, including stroke
(Wang et al. 1998). Recent report showed that TIMP-1 attenuates BBB permeability after stroke (Fujimoto et al. 2008),
but the brain edema after stroke may not be correlated to the
serum concentration of TIMP1. As to what extent correlation
between serum concentration and the whole cerebral level of
TIMP1 is unknown, this finding might stand very little significance. It is considered that TIMP1 is a very important regulator of the BBB, including BBB disruption induced by acute
liver failure and cerebral autoimmune disease (Chen et al.
2013; Ichiyama et al. 2006). However, it is unknown if resveratrol could regulate TIMP-1 during cerebral ischemic injury. In our study, we found that TIMP-1 was increased after
ischemia, which might be in response to the increase of MMP9. And this was consistent with the findings by Ichiyama T
et al. that in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, both
TIMP-1 and MMP-9 levels in the serum were increased in
the acute phase (Ichiyama et al. 2006). In our study, when
resveratrol was administrated, TIMP-1 was upregulated and
the activity was prompted. This suggested that resveratrol
might regulate the TIMP-1/MMP-9 balance to restore the
function of BBB. To further testify this, we applied the neutralizing antibody to break such a balance, and we proved that
a proper TIMP-1/MMP-9 balance was necessary for the beneficial effect of resveratrol in cerebral ischemia. However, to
come up with a more solid conclusion, more strong evidences
are needed and more detailed mechanism needed to be explored, like the TIMP-1/MMP-9 interaction, which is dominate or both.
Although we showed the anti-apoptosis effect of resveratrol in parallel with the improvement of BBB integrity, the

J Mol Neurosci (2015) 55:872–879

specific mechanism remains unclear. A decreased BBB permeability would decrease tissue edema and immunocyte extravasation, both of which would result in alleviated damage.
While there are reports that TIMP-1 could lead to the prevention of cell apoptosis (Stetler-Stevenson 2008). It is known
that active form of MMP-9 could cause the activation of
microglia (Woo et al. 2008). We therefore examined the
microglia by immunofluorescence staining of Iba1 at 24 h
after reperfusion. We found that resveratrol inhibited the activation of microglia which was associated with the inhibition
of MMP-9 and this was consistent with the former study by
Woo et al. (data not shown). Given the natural inhibitor of
MMP-9, this might due to both MMP-9 and TIMP-1. Thus,
the regulation of microglia by MMP-9 and TIMP-1 should
likely be involved in the cerebral protection afforded by
resveratrol. While regarding to the anti-apoptosis effect of
resveratrol, whether this was directly attributed to the TIMP1 upregulation or the reservation of the BBB integrity remains
unclear. But we can speculate that TIMP-1 was involved
because the neutralization of TIMP-1 abolished the antiapoptosis effect of resveratrol.
In this study, we concluded that resveratrol therapy induces
cerebral ischemic tolerance through regulation of TIMP-1.
