a b s t r a c t
Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) has been shown to be up-regulated under the
focal cerebral ischemia and protected against ischemic injury in rats. However, the underlying mechanisms are
unclear. The aim of this study was to verify the protection of MANF on the cerebral ischemic injury and further
investigate the possible mechanisms. Rat focal ischemic model was established by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The recombinant human MANF was therapeutically administrated to the ipsilateral ventricle at 2 h
after MCAO. MANF decreased the number of the propidium iodide (PI)- and TUNEL-positive neural cells. Contrarily, MANF protected the NeuN-positive cells in hippocampus and cortex from death induced by ischemia.
The more interesting results in this study were that MANF repressed the cleavage of caspase-3 triggered by
focal cerebral ischemia. MANF also reduced the elevated levels of BIP/Grp78, phosphorylated IRE1, and splicing
XBP1 induced by focal cerebral ischemia, but not affect CHOP expression. Meanwhile, focal cerebral ischemia elevated the levels of XBP1 mRNA, including unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) and spliced XBP1 (XBP1s). However, MANF
did not affect the expression of XBP1 mRNA, neither XBP1u nor XBP1s. These results suggest that MANF can prevent the neuron loss via inhibiting ischemia-induced apoptosis and regulating unfolded protein response-related
genes.

1. Introduction
Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), also
known ARMET, is a secreted protein [1,2]. The gene encoding MANF is
mapped to human chromosomal band 3p21 [3]. Belonging to the family
of evolutionarily conserved dopamine neurotrophic factors, MANF has
been found to have trophic effects on dopaminergic neurons and nondopaminergic cells [4,5]. Drosophila MANF is essential for maintenance
of dopamine positive neurites and dopamine levels in the ﬂy [6]. MANF
is involved in the regulation of dopaminergic neuron development in

zebraﬁsh [7] and modulation of GABAergic transmission to the DA neurons of the substantia nigra [8].
MANF mRNA and protein were widely expressed in the brain [9].
The expression and secretion of MANF were enhanced after endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cell lines [2,10–12] and mouse models
[13]. MANF was increased after epileptic insults and ischemia [2,9,14,
15]. Recent study showed that MANF was up-regulated in the activated
glial cells under focal cerebral ischemia and in vitro ER stress or nutrient
deprivation [16]. MANF was selectively secreted upon sarco ER calcium
deletion [12]. Pretreatment with the recombinant human MANF significantly reduced the volume of infarction as well as improved the behavior in stroke rats [2,17,18]. However, the mechanisms are still unknown.
In this study, we found that administration of recombinant human
MANF protein after ischemic injury reduced the cerebral ischemiainduced neuron loss and promoted behavioral recovery in rats. Further,
we found that MANF inhibited the cleavage of caspase-3, but not affected the expressions of ER stress-related proteins in the stroke rats. These
results suggest that MANF rescues the neuron loss via inhibiting
ischemia-induced apoptosis, which may shed light on the potential
therapy of ischemic brain diseases.

lateral ventricle. The injection was at the rate of 1 μl/min. The needle
was retained in the place for 5 min after injection. After recovery from
anesthesia, the rats were returned to their home cage. Body temperatures during and after surgery were maintained at 37 °C.

2.5. Expression and puriﬁcation of MANF protein
MANF was expressed and puriﬁed according to the method described before [2]. Brieﬂy, MANF cDNA cloned from HEK293 cells was
ampliﬁed using primers 5′-CAT GAC CAT GGG GCT GCG GCC GGG CGA
CTGC-3′ and 5′-GGC CTC GAG CAAATC GGT CCG TGC ACT GGC-3′ and
inserted into pET-28a (+) vector between NcoI and XhoI sites and conﬁrmed by sequencing. To express N-terminal 6 × His-tagged MANF,
Escherichia coli strain BL21 was transformed and grown at 37 °C. The recombinant protein was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG for 2 h. The protein
was puriﬁed with nickel resin. The bound protein was eluted followed
by dialysis overnight at 4 °C. The purity of MANF was evaluated by
SDS-PAGE gel. The puriﬁed protein was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C.

2.6. Behavioral testing
Neurological deﬁcit was evaluated by Bederson's score [21]. In a postural reﬂex test, rats were examined for the degree of abnormal posture
when suspended 20–30 cm above the testing table. They were scored
according to the criteria: 0 = rats extend both forelimbs straight; no observable deﬁcit; 1 = rats keep the one forelimb to the breast and extend
the other forelimb straight; 2 = rats show decreased resistance to lateral push in addition to behavior in score 1, without circling; and 3 = rats
twist the upper half of their body in addition to behavior in score 2.

2.3. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
Focal cerebral ischemia was performed using the method of right
MCAO with an intraluminal ﬁlament as described previously [19]. The
rats were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (3 ml/kg body weight)
by intraperitoneal injection [20]. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced
by using MCAO with a suture [14]. Brieﬂy, a nylon monoﬁlament was
inserted to the origin of the right MCA of rats. The ﬁlament was withdrawn at 2 h after occlusion to allow reperfusion for 48 h.
2.4. Treatment protocols
Rats were randomly divided into two groups: sham control (Sham)
and operative group. After operation, the rats with impaired behavior
were randomly divided into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) group
and MANF group. In sham operation, a right neck incision was made
to expose the arteries, but the nylon thread was not inserted into internal carotid artery. Then the rats were placed in a stereotaxic apparatus,
and MANF or PBS in the volume of 10 μl was injected into the right

2.7. Immunohistochemistry
The brain tissues were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Serial
coronal sections (3 μm) were prepared. The sections were incubated
with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C after blocking by 5% goat
serum. The slides were then incubated with secondary antibodies
at 37 °C for 1 h. 3′-3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB)
solution was applied to the slides and allow reaction for 5 min. The
slides were stained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in ethanol, and
mounted in neutral gum. The number of NeuN-positive cells was
counted in ﬁve randomly selected ﬁelds from four sections of each
group. The average from ﬁve randomly selected ﬁelds of each section

131

was used to calculate the mean and SEM of each group for further
statistical analysis.

2.8. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies
Rats were anesthetized and placed in a general holder and positioned inside the magnet. The head of rat was held in place inside the
3-inch surface coil. All MRI studies were performed using a 1.5 T
superconducting magnet (General Electric Medical Systems, Waukesha,
WI, USA). SE T1-weighted (TR/TE = 340/12 ms) and FSE T2-weighted
images (TR/TE = 4000/110 ms) were obtained from a 2.0 mm thick

(MCAO). MANF or PBS in the volume of 10 μl was injected into the right lateral ventricle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 24 h after treatment with the sequences
of T2-weighted imaging. The normal brain tissue appeared gray; the infarction region showed white. These axial brain sections were obtained at the different levels.

axial and coronal section without gap using a 40 mm × 40 mm ﬁeld of
view, then reconstructed using a 256 × 192 image matrix.
2.9. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining
Two days after MCAO, rats were decapitated. The brains were removed and sliced into 2.0-mm-thick sections. The brain slices were incubated in a 2% TTC solution (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 15 min at 37 °C
and then transferred into a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for ﬁxation.
The normal area of brain was stained red, whereas infarct tissue
remained unstained (white) [22]. The area of infarction in each slice
was measured with a digital scanner and Photoshop software (Adobe,
San Jose, CA, USA).
2.10. Immunoﬂuorescent staining
Brain sections were hydrated and rinsed in PBS. They were placed in
artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF) containing 5 mg/ml of propidium
iodide (PI) for 30 min, rinsed in ACSF [23]. After antigen retrieval, the
sections were permeabilized/blocked then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor
488- or 568-conjugated IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and observed under ﬂuorescent microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The nuclei of cells were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
(5 mg/ml).

nuclei was counted in ﬁve randomly selected ﬁelds from four sections
of each group [14]. The average from ﬁve randomly selected ﬁelds of
each section was used to calculate the mean and SEM of each group
for further statistical analysis.
2.12. RT-PCR for detection of XBP1s mRNA
The total RNA was isolated with TRIzol from the brain tissue. After
reverse transcription of total RNA, the cDNA is then used as template
for XBP1 mRNA ampliﬁcation with a pair of primers: 5′-TCA GAG GCA
GAG TCC AAG GG-3′ and 5′-AGA AAG GGA GGC TGG TAA GG-3′. The
levels of mRNA were normalized by GAPDH using primers: 5′-CAA
GGT CAT CCA TGA CAA CTT TG-3′ and 5′-GTC CAC CAC CCT GTT GCT
GTAG-3′. To differentiate spliced XBP1 mRNA (276 bp) from unspliced
pre-mRNA (302 bp), the pair of primers was designed to encompass
the intron containing a PstI site. Only unspliced XBP1 mRNA was cut
into two pieces with PstI (87 and 215 bp). PCR product was examined
by agarose gel electrophoresis.
2.13. Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were presented as the means ± SEM. Statistical
comparisons were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA followed by
Dunnett's test. P b 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

ventricle. PBS was injected as the vehicle control. Bederson's score, generally showing a negative relationship to the neurological deﬁcit, was
used to evaluate behavioral recovery before and after treatment. We
found that Bederson's score was lower in the rats treated with MANF
(1, 5, 10, and 20 μg) than that in the control rats from day 2 to day 14
after MCAO (Fig. 1A). The most effective dose of MANF was 5 μg/rat.
At this dose, there was a signiﬁcant difference in Bederson's score,
compared with the PBS control, at the 7th day after treatment
(Fig. 1B). These results indicate that MANF promotes behavioral recovery after MCAO.
MRI was used to estimate the ischemic lesions in vivo. T2-weighted
imaging was applied to analyze the residual infarct volume. These
axial brain sections were obtained at the different levels 2 days after
MCAO. It showed that MANF largely reduced the infarction area at a
dose of 5 μg, compared with the PBS control (Fig. 2). TTC staining also
showed that there was a signiﬁcantly lowering in infarction in the rats
receiving 5 μg MANF treatment (Fig. 3A). Ipsilateral ventricle MANF administration not only reduced the area of infarction (Fig. 3B–C), but also
reduced the volume of infarction (Fig. 3D). This was the same as the
Bederson's score; the most effective dose of MANF was found at 5 μg
each rat.

3.2. MANF inhibits the loss of neurons induced by ischemia
To explore the effects of MANF on the survival of neurons after
MACO, we detected the expression of neuron marker NeuN by using
of immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescent staining. PI staining
was used to identify the dead neural cells. We found that in the
sham group, the cerebral cortex was intact and there were many neurons there. However, a large number of neurons were lost both in
the cerebral cortex S1 (Fig. 4A–C) and in CA1 region of hippocampus
(Fig. 4A, D) after MCAO (PBS group). MANF administration obviously
prevented the loss of NeuN-positive cells from the death induced by
focal ischemia, compared with PBS group (Fig. 4A–B). PI staining demonstrated that MANF decreased the number of dead neural cells induced
by ischemia in the cerebral cortex (Fig. 4C) as well as in the hippocampus (Fig. 4D) at the dose of 5 μg. These ﬁndings indicate MANF inhibits
the loss of neurons induced by ischemia.
3.3. MANF prevents neurons from transient ischemia-induced apoptosis
To investigate whether MANF prevents neurons from transient
ischemia-induced apoptosis, we ﬁrstly performed the TUNEL staining.

Fig. 4. MANF rescues the loss of neurons induced by ischemia. The hemiplegic rats were treated with either PBS or 5 μg of MANF (n = 8/group) after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). MANF or PBS in the volume of 10 μl was injected into the right lateral ventricle. At 48 h after treatment, rats were decapitated. The neurons were detected in the cerebral cortex
and hippocampus by using immunohistochemistry with an antibody of anti-NeuN, a marker of mature neuron (A). The number of NeuN-positive cells was counted (B). Data are presented
as the means ± SEM. **P b 0.01, compared with Sham; ##P b 0.01, compared with PBS control. The double labeled immunoﬂuorescent staining of NeuN (green) and PI (red) was used to
detect the dead neurons in the cerebral cortex (C) and hippocampus (D). The brain tissues were stained 48 h after treatment. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain the
nuclei. Scale bar = 50 μm.

Fig. 4 (continued).

A few apoptotic cells were scattered in the cortex in the sham-operation
group (Fig. 5A, left panel). After MCAO, there were many TUNELpositive neurons in the ischemic cortex (Fig. 5A, middle panel). Treatment with MANF signiﬁcantly reduced the number of neurons stained
by TUNEL (Fig. 5A, right panel; Fig. 5B), suggesting that the application
of the recombinant MANF protein attenuated neuronal injury. We also
found that MANF greatly reduced the level of cleaved caspase-3 after
MACO, compared with the PBS group (Fig. 5C–D). However, MANF did
not affect the level of CHOP, a proapoptotic protein. These results suggest that suppression of the cleavage of caspase-3 may be one of the

mechanisms by which MANF protects neurons from ischemia-induced
apoptosis.
3.4. Effects of MANF on the expressions of ER stress-associated genes
Previous study demonstrated that MANF is an ER stress-inducible
protein and inhibits cell death induced by some insults [2,11,14,18,24,
25]. To know whether administration of MANF to ipsilateral ventricle affects the expression of ER stress-associated proteins, we examined the
levels of BIP, CHOP, splicing XBP1 (XBP1s), and phosphorylated IRE1.

Data are presented as the means ± SEM of at least three independent experiments. **p b 0.01, compared with sham control; ##p b 0.01, compared with PBS control.

We found that MACO caused a signiﬁcant up-regulation of ER stressassociated proteins. MANF signiﬁcantly restrained the elevation of BIP,
p-IRE1, and XBP1s (Fig. 6A–B), but did not affect CHOP expression.
Meanwhile, focal cerebral ischemia elevated the levels of XBP1 mRNA,
including unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) and spliced XBP1 (XBP1s). However,
MANF did not affect the expression of XBP1 mRNA, neither XBP1u, nor
XBP1s. These results indicate that unfolded protein response (UPR)
may be involved in the neuroprotection of MANF.
4. Discussion
In this study, we found a protective effect of MANF on transient cerebral ischemia, in which MANF signiﬁcantly reduced the size of cerebral infarction as well as improved the behavior in the stroke rats.
There is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the doses and the
effects of MANF. The maximal protective dose of MANF was 5 μg each
rat. The underlying mechanisms are still unknown. It was probably associated with the saturability of MANF receptor or cofactor. This notion
needs to be further veriﬁed. Similar ﬁndings about other trophic factors
were reported. For example, bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) at
lower doses reduced H2O2 toxicity in the cultured cortical neurons
and 6-OHDA-mediated toxicity in dopaminergic neurons, but at higher

doses, increased the toxicity [26,27]. The dose–response pattern of
persephin, a trophic factor in the GDNF family, was previously reported
in cerebral ischemia [28]. Another noticeable ﬁnding of this study is the
suppression of MANF on neuron loss induced by focal cerebral ischemia
in hippocampus and cortex. MANF not only reduced the total number of
dead neurons with positive PI staining, but also prevented neurons from
apoptotic death detected by TUNEL staining.
MANF and CDNF (conserved dopamine neurotrophic factor) belong
to novel evolutionally conserved family of neurotrophic factors [10] and
they are structurally similar with almost a 60% amino acid sequence
identity [4]. Both of them can protect neural cells against from ER
stress-induced injury [4,29]. The study on MANF solution structure revealed that MANF is composed of two domains, a saposin-like Nterminal domain and a well-conserved ﬂexible C-terminal domain
with a cysteine bridge [29]. The cysteine bridge may be involved in catalyzing the formation of intramolecular disulphide bonds and protein
folding in the ER. The crystallographic ﬁnding was conﬁrmed by
employing high-resolution NMR spectroscopy to determine the threedimensional structure of full-length human MANF in solution, and the
C-terminal domain was characterized as structural unit of MANF protein
[30,31]. The C-terminal domain of MANF is homologous to the SAP domain of Ku70 [32–34], a well-known inhibitor of Bcl-2-associated X

protein (Bax) [35,36]. The cellular studies demonstrated that the protective effect of MANF on neurons was similar to Ku70 [32,37]. The
structural similarity to the active site motif of thiol/disulﬁde oxidoreductases may partially explain the protective mechanisms of MANF involved in focal cerebral ischemic injury [38].
The ER, serving as a site of Ca2+ storage, is also responsible for folding and modiﬁcation of proteins targeted for membranes or secreted
from the cell [39–41]. The internal environment of ER is susceptible to
perturbation by various pathogenic insults, such as oxidative stress, genetic mutations, hypoxia, and viral infection [41,42]. Consequently, the
unfolding/misfolding proteins are accumulated in the ER and caused
ER stress [42]. ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR)

to restore ER homeostasis. In cerebral ischemic injury, slight or earlier
ER stress triggers molecular and cellular repairing mechanism [43].
BIP/Grp78 was considered as a cytoprotective protein in stressed cells
[44]. BIX, a selective inducer of BIP/Grp78, was reported to reduce the
area of infarction and protect against cell death induced by focal cerebral ischemia after pretreatment [45]. MANF, an ER stress inducible protein, was found to be signiﬁcantly induced at translational level at the
early stage of ischemia when CHOP mRNA was not increased and the
histological change was not detectable [14,46]. This suggests that
MANF is more sensitive to ischemia than CHOP. Therefore, MANF
and CHOP possibly play diverse roles on ischemic injury. CHOP is a
proapoptotic protein involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis. Our

previous study showed that MANF and CHOP were induced in the ischemic brain, and MANF treatment protected the primarily cultured neurons from ER stress and nutrient starvation-induced injury in vitro
[14,32,37].
In this study, we also found that MANF signiﬁcantly restrained the
elevation of BIP, p-IRE1, and XBP1s induced by focal cerebral ischemia.
However, MANF did not affect the transcriptional level of XBP1 under
the condition of focal cerebral ischemia. As a nuclear transcriptional factor, XBP1s can regulate the transcription of its downstream genes.
MANF may regulate the function of XBP1s at protein level. Very recently,
it was reported that UPR pathways were constitutively activated in the
pancreatic islets of MANF-deﬁcient mice. The expressions of XBP1s and
CHOP mRNA were increased following the up-regulation of BIP [47].
These results indicate that UPR may be involved in the cell protection
of MANF.
Caspases play critical roles in the common pathway of apoptosis.
Caspase-3 is a key member of executioner caspases. To elucidate the
mechanisms by which MANF exerts anti-apoptotic roles in neurons,
we investigated the activation of caspase-3. We found that transient
focal cerebral ischemia caused by MCAO triggered the cleavage of
caspase-3, while treatment with MANF repressed the level of the
cleaved caspase-3. This result may partially explain the neuroprotective
effects of MANF after cerebral ischemia. In terms of the anti-apoptosis, a
similar mechanism was reported for other neurotrophic factors, such as
GDNF [48]. However, not like MANF, GDNF was not found to be regulated by ER stress.
Taken together, the administration of MANF to ipsilateral ventricle
was neuroprotective against ischemic insults. The protective response
of MANF may be involved in regulating UPR pathway and inhibiting
the cleavage of caspase-3. The effectiveness of MANF treatment in ischemic injury may shed a light on therapy for transient ischemic attacks
and other disorders involved in ER stress.
