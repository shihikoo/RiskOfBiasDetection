Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating form of stroke leading to a high rate of death and disability
worldwide. Although it has been hypothesized that much of the IHC insult occurs in the subacute period
mediated via a series of complex pathophysiological cascades, the molecular mechanisms involved in ICH
have not been systematically characterized. Among the best approaches to understand the underlying
mechanisms of injury and recovery, protein dynamics assessment via proteomics/systems biology platforms represent one of the cardinal techniques optimized for mechanisms investigation and biomarker
identiﬁcation. A proteomics approach may provide a biomarker focused framework from which to identify candidate biomarkers of pathophysiological processes involved in brain injury after stroke. In this
work, a neuroproteomic approach (LC–MS/MS) was applied to investigate altered expression of proteins
that are induced in brain tissue 3 h after injury in a rat model of ICH. Data from sham and focal ischemic
models were also obtained and used for comparison. Based on the differentially expressed protein proﬁle,
systems biology analysis was conducted to identify associated cellular processes and related interaction
maps. After LC–MS/MS analysis of the 3 h brain lysates, 86 proteins were differentially expressed between
hemorrhagic and sham tissues. Furthermore, 38 proteins were differentially expressed between ischemic
and sham tissues. On the level of global pathway analysis, hemorrhagic stroke proteins were shown to be
involved in autophagy, ischemia, necrosis, apoptosis, calpain activation, and cytokine secretion. Moreover, ischemic stroke proteins were related to cell death, ischemia, inﬂammation, oxidative stress, caspase
activation and apoptotic injury. In conclusion, the proteomic responses identiﬁed in this study provide
key information about target proteins involved in speciﬁc pathological pathways.

1. Introduction
Intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke (ICH) is a devastating form
of stroke associated with signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality, accounting for 10–15% of strokes in Western industrialized
countries (Feigin et al., 2009; van Asch et al., 2010). The annual

incidence of ICH in Asian countries has been found to be twoto three-fold higher (Suzuki et al., 1987). Compared with white
populations, Chinese populations have been reported to have a
higher proportion of ICH (Tsai et al., 2013). During ICH, rapid
accumulation of blood within the brain parenchyma disrupts the
normal anatomy and increases local pressure (Aronowski and Zhao,
2011). Brain injury following ICH is a dynamic process involving a
cascade of complex pathological pathways and biochemical and
metabolic events. There are two phases of injury involved, primary and secondary injury, affecting the clinical outcome after
ICH. The primary damage occurs within minutes to hours following the onset of bleeding and is related to the direct effect of the
hematoma (Qureshi et al., 2009). The secondary damage is the

C. Ren et al. / Brain Research Bulletin 102 (2014) 46–56

result of a series of adverse complex events mostly due to the
presence of intraparenchymal blood (Aronowski and Zhao, 2011).
Unfortunately, elucidation of the complex cellular mechanisms
underlying ICH represents a major challenge due to the complexity of different pathological mechanisms involved. Furthermore, no
therapies addressing the primary and secondary injury events have
been proven beneﬁcial.
In recent years, Omic-‘systems biology’ approach utilizing
large-scale analysis of proteins and/or gene transcripts has led
to identifying new aspects of pathogenesis mechanisms. These
advanced screening platforms allow an objective identiﬁcation of
potential biomarkers that may also represent new therapeutic targets. Gene expression proﬁling of perihematomal tissue after ICH
has been performed in animal models as well as in human ICH samples (Carmichael et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2006). Lu et al. analyzed
gene expression in the striatum and the cortex brain regions at
24 h, after intracranial infusions of blood into the striatum of adult
rats using genome microarrays. This resulted in the identiﬁcation
of 369 ICH-regulated gene expressions (Lu et al., 2006). In other
studies, neuroproteomic approaches have been utilized for studying the pathological process involved in ICH. Chiu et al. analyzed
the effect of hyperglycemia on ICH by 2D gel combined with mass
spectrometry 24 h after ICH in rat (Chiu et al., 2012). This study
elucidated the changes occurring during the secondary damage
period of ICH. Furthermore, Carmichael et al. compared ICH induced
changes in mRNA expression in perihematomal tissue in humans
within 24 h after the hemorrhage. This study has shown that in
human perihematomal tissue networks of pro-inﬂammatory and
anti-inﬂammatory, mediators are activated during the secondary
damage period (Carhuapoma et al., 2000) However, in the early
stage of ICH, protein changes in response to the ICH induced brain
injury remains to be investigated. Thus, a proteomics proﬁling of
perihematomal tissue proteome in the earlier stage of ICH would
be useful to complete the sketch of onset ICH and contribute to the
identiﬁcation of putative biomarkers that can distinguish between
ICH and ischemic stroke.
To better understand the molecular pathophysiology of ICH
Brain injury, an LC–MS/MS based approach was used to determine
the overall proﬁle of protein expression in a rat model of hemorrhagic stroke at 3 h after injury. The identiﬁcation of biomarkers for
acute myocardial infarction has proven useful for routine clinical
diagnosis and prognosis (Chu et al., 2002). The proteins identiﬁed
by this approach may also provide a guide to identify potential
biomarkers. Furthermore, we also performed a proteomic view of
the focal ischemic model at the same time point. To the best of our
knowledge, this neuroproteomic study is the ﬁrst study to screen
differentially expressed proteins in an ICH model in the primary
stage, speciﬁcally, 3 h after ICH.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Rat stroke models
The experimental design and all procedures are in accordance
with the Animal Care Guidelines of the Animal Experimental Committee of Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University and the
National Institutes of Health. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing
280–300 g were used in this study. Rats were randomly assigned
into experimental and control groups. Intracerebral hemorrhage
was induced by injection of collagenase Type VII (Matsushita et al.,
2000). A 1 ␮l of saline containing 0.5 U collagenase VII-S (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) was injected via a 22-gauge needle over 5 min into
the right striatum (from bregma: 1.2 mm posterior, 3.5 mm lateral,
and 5.3 mm depth) using a stereotactic frame. The needle was left
in place for 5 min, and then withdrawn slowly. After completion
of collagenase infusion, craniotomies were sealed with bone wax,

47

and wounds were closed. As a model for focal ischemic stroke (IS),
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by an intraluminal ﬁlament was performed as described by Longa et al. (1989).
Rats were harvested at 3 h after stroke. Sham animals went through
similar surgical procedures but were not injured.
2.2. Methods for measurement of CBF, neurological deﬁcits, brain
infarct and brain hemorrhage
To verify MCA occlusion, local cerebral blood ﬂow (CBF) in the
cortex supplied by the right MCA was measured by a DRT4 laser
Doppler ﬂowmetry (PERIMED 5000, Sweden) (Ding et al., 2002)
before (baseline) and during occlusion. A small craniectomy was
performed to expose the right parietal cortex. The LDF probe was
stereotaxically placed on the exposed, intact dura 3 mm posterior and 5 mm lateral to bregma. Changes in regional CBF during
ischemia and reperfusion were calculated as a percentage of the
pre-ischemic baseline (Ding et al., 2002).
Neurological deﬁcits in the rats were examined after ischemia
and intracerebral hemorrhagic surgery. The deﬁcits were scored
on a modiﬁed system based on the scoring system developed by
(Longa et al., 1989) and is as follows: (0) no deﬁcits; (1) difﬁculty in
fully extending the contralateral forelimb; (2) unable to extend the
contralateral forelimb; (3) mild circling to the contralateral side; (4)
severe circling; and (5) falling to the contralateral side. Rats that did
not display neurologic deﬁcits were removed from the experiment.
Three hours after surgery, the rats were anesthetized with 1%
chloral hydrate. Following the anesthetization, the brains were
removed and sectioned coronally at the level of the optic chiasm (2 mm posterior to the chiasm) generating one section.
In the ICH stroke model, 2 mm-thick slices of rat brain were
used for observation of intracerebral hemorrhage, whereas in
the IS model, sections were stained with 2% solution of 2,3,4triphenytetrazolium-chloride (TTC) for visualization of infarct
volume. The ipsilateral hemisphere was rapidly dissected (cerebellum brain tissue was not included), rinsed in ice-cold PBS,
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 ◦ C until used.
2.3. Proteomic analysis
2.3.1. Trypsin digestion
Rat brain tissue (naive, ischemic 3 h, hemorrhagic 3 h) was
lysed with Triton × buffer and the protein extract concentration of
each lysate was normalized to 10 ␮g/␮L (n = 8, each). In-solution
trypsin digestion of the protein extracts was conducted using the
Filter-Assisted Sample Preparation digestion kit (FASP) according
to the manufacturer’s procedure (Protein Discovery, Expedeon,
San Diego, CA) (Wisniewski et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, protein extract
was reduced with DTT and mixed with f urea solution in the
spin ﬁlter. Sample ﬂow-through was discarded after washing with
another 200 ␮L of urea sample solution. Proteins on the spin ﬁlter were alkylated with iodoacetamide. The proteins in the ﬁlter
were washed twice with urea and twice with 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate (NH4 HCO3 ). Trypsin digestion was conducted at 37 ◦ C
overnight using a trypsin: protein ratio of 1:100. After incubation, the spin ﬁlter was washed twice with 50 mM NH4 HCO3 and
0.5 M sodium chloride. Tryptic peptides were collected, acidiﬁed
and desalted via C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) (Supelco Discovery SPE, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The ﬁltrate was dried under a
vacuum and tryptic peptides were resuspended in 0.1% formic acid
for subsequent LC–MS/MS analysis.
2.3.2. LC–MS/MS analysis
Each sample was analyzed by reversed-phase nanoﬂow liquid
chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)
using a Proxeon Easy nLC-II system (Thermo, San Jose, CA) coupled

48

C. Ren et al. / Brain Research Bulletin 102 (2014) 46–56

to a Thermo LTQ Velos dual pressure linear ion trap system
(Thermo, San Jose, CA). A sample of two microliters was loaded
via the autosampler onto a trap column (EASY-Column 2 cm,
ID 100 ␮m, 5 ␮m, C18-A) then directed to an analytical column
(EASY-Column, 10 cm, ID 75 ␮m, 3 ␮m, C18-A2) at a ﬂow rate of
250 nL/min. The mobile phase consisted of solvent A (100% water
with 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (100% acetonitrile with 0.1%
formic acid). Separation was achieved using a run time of 100 min.
The ﬁrst linear gradient was from 2% to 40% B over 90 min, the
second linear gradient was from 40% to 80% B over 5 min. It was
then held for 5 min while returning to the initial mobile phase
composition (2% B). Tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) were acquired
on the top 10 most abundant ions at a given chromatographic time
point via a data dependent scan. The samples were analyzed in
one sequence where in each sample group (n = 8) was bracketed
by a sequence injection of the following: water blank, Cytochrome
C standard digest, water blank. Each sample had a run time of 2 h.
The analysis was completed within 72 h with no interruption from
start to end of the sequence.
2.3.3. Peptide/protein identiﬁcation
All tandem mass spectra were extracted by Xcalibur version
2.7.0 and analyzed by Sequest (Proteome Discoverer, Thermo, San
Jose, CA) and X! Tandem (www.thegpm.org; version 2007.01.01.1).
Sequest (v. sp3.1.1) and X! Tandem were set up to search through
a trypsin-indexed reversed concatenated IPI rat protein database
(v.3.87, 79,850 entries) with a fragment ion mass tolerance of
0.8 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 2.0 Da. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was speciﬁed in Sequest and X! Tandem as a ﬁxed
modiﬁcation and the oxidation of methionine was speciﬁed as a
variable modiﬁcation. Scaffold 3 (Proteome Software, Portland, OR)
was used to compile Sequest search results and validate MS/MS
based peptide and protein identiﬁcations. Label-free relative abundance quantitation was done by the spectral counting approach. To
evaluate the applicability of spectral counting to our study under
our experimental conditions, similar to veriﬁcations performed by
other groups (Prokai et al., 2009), control rat brain lysates containing 200 ␮g proteins were spiked with known amounts of bovine
serum albumin (BSA). They were then subjected to trypsin digestion by FASP and LC–MS/MS analysis. To ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant
differentially expressed proteins, t-tests were performed comparing normalized spectral counts between sham and ischemic, or
sham and hemorrhagic, with 8 samples per group. The threshold
for signiﬁcance was p < 0.05.

means of Western blot. Brieﬂy, equal protein amounts (from 50
to 80 ␮g depending on each speciﬁc protein) of brain homogenates
were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA) and then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore).
Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% skim milk in TBS-T buffer
and immersed overnight at 4 ◦ C with the following antibodies:
rabbit anti-synaptojanin-1 (1:300, abcam, USA), rabbit anti-DRP2 (1:500; Santa Cruz) and mouse anti-septin5 (1:300, abcam, USA).
The speciﬁc reaction was visualized by the chemiluminescence
substrate luminal reagent (GE Healthcare, UK). Blot images were
then scanned. The optical density of protein levels was quantiﬁed
using IPP software (version 5.1, Media Lybernetics, USA), corrected
for protein load determined by ␤-actin, and expressed as the relative value to controls. Five rats were used in each group.
2.5. Systems biology
Systems biology was used to categorize the differentially
expressed proteins from proteomics, by comparing sham to 3 h
hemorrhagic or sham to 3 h ischemic. Pathway Studio 9.0 (Ariadne)
was used to perform pathway analysis of the identiﬁed proteins.
Three types of analysis were conducted including interactome
mapping, enriched pathway analysis, and global pathway analysis.
Interactome maps depict the inter-protein interactions occurring
among the identiﬁed protein hits, reﬂecting how close the identiﬁed protein is to the other protein families. The direct interaction
algorithm utilizes protein/gene parameters without the introduction of a third party protein. It uses the ﬁlters of direct binding,
post-translational modiﬁcations (PTM), or direct regulation occurring among the identiﬁed proteins. The enriched pathway analysis
highlights and focuses on a group of altered pathways belonging to a major biological theme. For example, signaling pathways,
pro-survival, injury themes, etc. This enriched pathway analysis
represents a subset of the total possible interactions, and thus there
may be multiple enriched pathways. Similarly, not all of the differentially expressed proteins will appear on the maps; only the
proteins with known interactions or associations are displayed.
Finally, the global pathway analysis depicts the global altered
pathways that are selected in the context of the studied projects.
The presence of these pathways constitutes and identiﬁes major
themes occurring in the biological system.

Western blotting analysis, semi-quantitative evaluation of protein
expression was performed via computer-assisted densitometric
scanning (Epson XL3500 high resolution ﬂatbed scanner) and image
analysis using NIH ImageJ densitometry software (version 1.6, NIH,
Bethesda, MD). Changes in any outcome parameter were compared
with the appropriate control group. Thus, the magnitude of change
from control in one model system could be directly compared with
the magnitude of change from any other model system. In this
study, six replicate results were evaluated by Student’s t-test and
ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests.
All hypothesis tests conducted were 2-tailed. A value of p < 0.05
was considered signiﬁcant. All statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism version 5 (GraphPad Software).
3. Results
3.1. CBF, neurological deﬁcits, brain infarct and brain hemorrhage
A total of 8 rats subjected to MCAO showed signiﬁcant reduction in regional cerebral blood ﬂow during ischemia as monitored
by LDF, with a value that dropped to 21.6 ± 4.1% of the pre-ischemic
level. Ischemia induced infarct was clearly visualized (Fig. 1). The
neurological score was 2.25 ± 0.46. A total of 8 rats subjected to
ICH showed hematomas in striatum (Fig. 1). The neurological score
was 2.25 ± 0.46. The neurological score of the sham group was
0.25 ± 0.46.
3.2. Proteomic analysis
LC–MS/MS-based shotgun proteomics and label-free relative
quantiﬁcation were employed for the study of differentially

expressed proteins in animal models of ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke. Abundance-based proteomic surveys involving minimal
sample preparation and label-free MS-based relative quantiﬁcation
have been utilized in different protein-proﬁling studies (Liu et al.,
2004; Old et al., 2005; Prokai et al., 2009). In this study, a rapid
sample preparation using a commercially available ﬁlter-assisted
digestion kit (FASP, Protein Discovery, Expedeon, CA) adapted from
the protocol developed by Wisniewski et al. (2009) was used.
A total identiﬁed MS/MS spectra for BSA increased proportionally with the increase in BSA spiked into the brain tissue lysate
(Fig. 2).
Proteins identiﬁed from the LC–MS/MS analysis and Sequest
database search were compiled and displayed in a complete experimental view to compare sham versus ischemic stroke group and
sham versus hemorrhagic stroke groups. Using the decoy database,

Scaffold calculated a 0% protein false positive rate. At a high stringency threshold of 99.9% protein probability with a minimum of 2
unique peptides identiﬁed at 95% peptide probability, a total of 590
proteins were identiﬁed in the 3 h ischemic stroke samples and 609
proteins in the 3 h hemorrhagic stroke samples. Statistical analyses
of the normalized spectral counts (Quantitative value, from Scaffold) were performed on the naïve and the experimental groups
by t-test using a p-value threshold of ≤0.05 for signiﬁcance. In the
hemorrhagic stroke group, 86 proteins were identiﬁed to be differentially expressed, of which 35 proteins showed an increase in
abundance (Table 1) and 51 proteins showed a decrease in abundance (Table 2). While in the ischemic stroke group, 38 proteins
were identiﬁed to be differentially expressed of which 16 showed
an increase in abundance (Table 3) and 22 showed a decrease in
abundance (Table 4). The fold-change of the average normalized

spectral counts (versus sham) was calculated for each protein that
was identiﬁed to be differentially expressed.
3.3. Validation of protein expression by Western blot

approach used in this study, we used three criteria to select proteins
for analysis by Western blot: (I) p-value <0.01. (II) Representing
different fold changes. (III) We were interested in the functions
of the protein. Dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) and

and Septin-5 showed lower levels in ICH brain versus sham brain
(Fig. 3A and B). The analysis revealed that all proteins performed
similarly to the LC–MS/MS analysis results (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we
selected synaptojanin-1, which was upregulated in both ICH and IS

brain in LC–MS/MS analysis. The result showed that the expression
of synaptojanin-1 was very similar high levels in both ICH and IS
brain analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 3C).
3.4. Systems biology analysis
Using the differentially expressed proteins from the proteomic
analysis, systems biology analysis was conducted to identify cellular processes that are associated with the proteins. To evaluate
the 3 h hemorrhagic neuroproteome, differentially expressed and
pro-injury proteins were placed in global pathways (Fig. 4A) and
enriched pathways, respectively (Fig. 4B). Globally, hemorrhagic
proteins were involved in autophagy, ischemia, necrosis, apoptosis, calpain activation and cytokine production. To evaluate the 3 h
ischemic neuroproteome, differentially expressed proteins were
placed in global pathways (Fig. 5A) and enriched pathways (Fig. 5B
and C). On the systems biology level, ischemic proteins were related
to cell death, ischemia, inﬂammation, oxidative stress, caspase activation, and apoptosis (Fig. 5A). The differentially expressed proteins
in ischemic brain were associated both with pro-injury (Fig. 5B)
and pro-survival pathways (Fig. 5C). Despite the pathway, maps
showed that the neuroproteomes have some overlap between the
two types of stroke. Furthermore, there are still numerous distinct
elements with signiﬁcance.
4. Discussion
Experimental ICH is commonly induced in rodents by injection
of collagenase (Fujiwara et al., 2011; Geng et al., 2012; Matsushita
et al., 2000). Using the ICH rat model followed by LC–MS/MS
proteomics approach, we identiﬁed 86 proteins that responded
differentially during the early stage of intracerebral hemorrhage.
Furthermore, using a well-established focal ischemic stroke model
induced by MCAO, we identiﬁed 38 proteins that were differentially altered during the early stage of ischemic stroke rat models.
The current study focuses on ICH/IS; more speciﬁcally on the proteins that are highly regulated by ICH/IS and appear to be related to
the pathophysiology of the early period of ICH/IS. The identiﬁcation,
classiﬁcation and analysis of the groups of proteins might shed light
on the molecular basis of injury process after ICH. It is clear from
the systems biology analysis that, although the neuroproteomes of
the two types of stroke had some overlap, there are several characteristic and distinctive elements that highly distinguish between
the two events.
4.1. Ischemic effect
After arteriolar rupture and parenchymal hemorrhage in the
brain, the aggressive lowering of blood pressure might promote
cerebral ischemia adjacent to the hematoma (Prabhakaran and
Naidech, 2012). However, imaging studies using single-photon
emission CT, positron emission tomography, CT and MR singlephoton emission computed tomography, and perfusion studies
have failed to show any signiﬁcant rim of perihematomal ischemia
(Carhuapoma et al., 2000; Zazulia et al., 2001). Perihematomal
blood ﬂow reductions are most prominent immediately after
ICH in rats, which can develop hypoxia/ischemia in perihematomal tissue (Yang et al., 1994). Our proteomics results showed
that several proteins are associated with the ischemia of brain
after ICH. The molecules that we identiﬁed include a number of proteins involved in metabolic processes such as heat
shock protein 105, l-lactate dehydrogenase A, peroxiredoxin1 (PRDX1), glutathione-S-transferase P, Alpha-enolase, pyruvate
dehydrogenase E1 component, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C,
6-phosphofructokinase type C, catalase and lactoylglutathione
lyase. Additionally, many of the identiﬁed proteins are cytoplasmic

enzymes of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as a consequence of the remodeling of anaerobic and aerobic metabolism
in response to the variation in oxygen and nutrients availability.
Enolase activity is modulated by oxygen availability and by plasminogen (Capello et al., 2011). Low levels of enolase have been
shown in a mouse ischemia model (Di Domenico et al., 2012).
In other neurologic diseases, namely, amnestic mild cognitive
impairment and AD, alpha-enolase was found to be consistently
up-regulated (Butterﬁeld and Lange, 2009). These contrasting
responses of enolase to different disease models might be the result
of different stages and experimental conditions.

4.2. Autophagy
Autophagy is a cellular degradation process in which cellular proteins and organelles are sequestered in double membrane
vesicles, known as autophagosomes, and delivered tolysosomes to
be digested by lysosomal hydrolases (Wang and Klionsky, 2003).
Recent studies indicate that autophagy occurs in subarachnoid
hemorrhage, ICH and cerebral ischemia (Lee et al., 2010; Papadakis
et al., 2013; Schuckit, 2009). In this experimental study, we found
that several autophagy-associated proteins, including heat shock
protein 90 (HSP90), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase,
kinase 2 (CAMKK2), mitogen-activated protein kinase, and kinase
1 (MAP2K1), were downregulated after 3 h ICH. These proteins are
reported to increase autophagic activity in a number of pathological processes (Kang et al., 2007; Liang et al., 2007; Reikvam et al.,
2009; Underwood et al., 2010). Furthermore, catalase, a H2 O2 scavenger, which reduces autophagy, was upregulated. Taken together,
these ﬁndings indicate that autophagy might be inhibited at the
early stage of ICH induced injury, in contrast to previous evidence
showing that the autophagy was activated in the pathogenesis of
ICH and subarachnoid hemorrhage (He et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2013).
The different stage of ICH-induced injury might have contributed
to the differences in results. Further studies are needed to assess
the relationship between autophagy and acute and subacute phases
after ICH.

4.3. Necrosis and apoptosis
Apoptosis develops in perihematomal brain tissue during the
ﬁrst 24 h following ICH (Matsushita et al., 2000). Necrotic brain
tissue has been found adjacent to the hematoma (Aronowski and
Zhao, 2011). Mechanical forces during hematoma formation or
chemical toxicity from the clot might cause the necrosis. The cell
death around ICH has been attributed to mass effect, hemoglobin
increase (Wagner et al., 2003), blood derived coagulation factors
increase (Xi et al., 2006) and complement C3 activation (Yang et al.,
2006). During the primary stage, blood extravasation is deemed to
act as a contributor to ICH-affected tissue damage. Furthermore,
very high levels of proteins, such as albumin and ﬁbrinogen, are
consistent with an alteration of the blood–brain barrier permeability. Our results are in line with these reports. Using microarray
approach, some pieces of research showed that cell death associated genes, cytochrome C, NF-␬B, TNF-␣, and caspase were involved
in the response to ICH (Carmichael et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2006).
However, these proteins were not identiﬁed in this study. This may
be due to the inconformity between mRNA and protein and to the
short duration of the ICH in the present study. After long-term ICH,
as described in previous studies (Lu et al., 2006), these cell death
pathways could be triggered. In addition, the hemorrhagic injury
in our model was relatively mild as compared to the severe pathology of the acute neuronal injury that follows hemorrhagic stroke
in humans.

4.4. Structural proteins
Several structural proteins including tubulin beta-5, tubulin
alpha-1A, tubulin beta-3 and tubulin beta-4, were upregulated
during early ICH as a result of induced stress in the rat brain.
These proteins are typical structural proteins that are ubiquitously
expressed in all eukaryotic cells and that play essential roles in
heterodimerization and assembly to form microtubules. Tubulin
beta-3 is primarily expressed in neurons and may be involved in
neurogenesis and axon guidance and maintenance. Mutations in
this gene are the cause of congenital ﬁbrosis of the extra ocular
muscles type 3 (Demer et al., 2010). However, its function during ICH induced stress is not completely understood. In our study,
ICH induced the synthesis of tubulin beta-3 allowing the neurons
to maintain their shape and perform neurogenesis, thus playing a
pro-survival role. Combining our data, the speciﬁc neuronal expression of tubulin beta-3 might be useful for developing biomarkers
to estimate the prognosis.
Therefore, we hypothesized that these structural proteins have
an important role in the early ICH response. We propose that the
synthesis of structural proteins contributes to the maintenance of
the shape and function of cells. These proteins are deemed to foster
adaptation of the cells to a nutrition-depleted environment.
4.5. Oxidative stress response proteins
Oxidative stress appears to play a prominent role in ICH
pathogenesis (Aronowski and Zhao, 2011). Superoxide dismutase
(Mn) (SOD2), Guanine nucleotide-binding protein, peroxiredoxin1 (PRDX), and l-lactate dehydrogenase were downregulated; while
catalase was upregulated in ICH brain. SOD2 and catalase are
endogenous antioxidants. Catalase converts hydrogen peroxide,
the reactive oxygen species, to water and oxygen thereby mitigating the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide. SOD2 binds to the
superoxide byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation and converts
them to hydrogen peroxide and diatomic oxygen. The contrasting
responses of the two antioxidants might be the result of different stages as well as the different roles of the antioxidants in
the response to ICH stress. PRDX family proteins are antioxidant
enzymes within cells and are essential for cell survival in brain
and other organ injuries (Rashidian et al., 2009; Yeh et al., 1999).
Nakaso et al. reported that PRDX1 was upregulated around the
hemorrhagic region one day post ICH onset (Nakaso et al., 2000).
However, the result is not consistent with our ﬁndings. We speculate that PRDX1 has a dynamic expression in the development
of ICH-affected tissue damage. Given that extracellular PRDX acts
as a neurotoxic danger signal triggering subsequent inﬂammation
(Shichita et al., 2012), its downregulation may protect against neurotoxicity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to
be released during hypoxia/ischemia, which may contribute to the
stabilization of hypoxia induced factor-1␣ (HIF-1␣) (Chandel et al.,
2000). However, HIF-1␣ was not identiﬁed in this study either
because the expression level was too low to be detected or because
there was no signiﬁcant difference at this time point. The limitations of this approach should also be considered.
4.6. Other proteins
Septin-5 is abundantly expressed in the developing and adult
brains of rodents and humans. Septin-5 is expressed in presynaptic
terminals and exerts negative regulatory control over neurotransmitter release by binding to SNARE-protein (Dong et al., 2003). It
is reported that social isolation reduces septin-5 protein levels in
the rat striatum (Barr et al., 2004). Septin-5 was downregulated in
the human brain after IS (Cuadrado et al., 2010). Our result, similar to that report, conﬁrms the ﬁndings as shown by Western blot

55

analysis (Fig. 3A). The DRP-2 (also known as CRMP-2) is involved
in axonal outgrowth and plays a role in synaptic signaling through
interactions with calcium channels (Yoshimura et al., 2005). Moreover, DRP-2 has been implicated in multiple neurological disorders
(Johnston-Wilson et al., 2000; Silva et al., 2013). Chun et al. fond an
increase of DRP-2 after 24 h on brain ischemia in rat (Chen et al.,
2007). In our study, LC–MS/MS analysis did not show the expression
change in IS model. However, LC–MS/MS and Western blot analysis show that DRP-2 was downregulated in ICH models (Fig. 3B).
Synaptojanin-1 is a highly abundant phosphoinositide phosphatase in nerve terminals that regulates the levels of membrane
phosphatidylinositol-4 and 5-bisphosphate. As such, synaptojanin1 has been thought to affect synaptic transmission and membrane
trafﬁcking (Arai et al., 2001, 2002). In this study, synaptojanin-1
was upregulated in both ICH and IS models as validated by Western blotting (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that synaptic function
could be partially affected by ICH induced damage.
4.7. Limitation
We consider that this study will be strengthened if multiple
time points were assessed, to provide a real time alteration of the
dynamic protein changes rather than rely at a single time point
to highlight a the altered pathways and biological processes. Neurosystems biology analysis was used as a predictor of the altered
functional pathways involved and it can illustrate the functional
role and the relation of the identiﬁed differential proteins identiﬁed/veriﬁed. However, we consider that assessing multiple time
points would have strengthened the study. As the ﬁrst step, we
selected this time point. We plan to analyze the protein proﬁles at
other time points along the earlier or later stages during stroke in
our future study.
5. Conclusions
Taken together, our data suggest that altered protein expression and autophagy may play crucial roles in the early response
to ICH-induced brain injury. This information may help broaden
our existing knowledge on the mechanism of ICH. Furthermore,
although the pathway maps showed that the neuroproteomes of
the two types of stroke had some overlap, there were still many
distinctive elements between the two types of stroke, which may
ultimately lead to the development of biomarkers and effective
therapies.
