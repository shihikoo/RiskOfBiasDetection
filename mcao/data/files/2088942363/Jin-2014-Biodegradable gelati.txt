Gelatin microspheres (GMSs) are widely used as drug carriers owing to their excellent biocompatibilities
and toxicologically safe degradation products. The drug release proﬁle is easily tailored by controlling the
cross-linking density and surface-to-volume ratio, i.e. size, of the GMS. In this study, we employed GMSs
which are 25 lm in diameter and cross-linked with 0.03125% glutaraldehyde, to enable rapid initial and a
subsequent sustained release. Therapeutic potency of human recombinant osteopontin (rhOPN) with or
without encapsulation into GMSs was investigated after administrating them to rat stroke model
(Sprague–Dawley; middle cerebral artery occlusion, MCAO). The administration of rhOPN/GMS
(100 ng/100 lg) at 1 h post-MCAO reduced the mean infarct volume by 81.8% of that of the untreated
MCAO control and extended the therapeutic window at least to 12 h post-MCAO, demonstrating a markedly enhanced therapeutic potency for the use of OPN in the post-ischemic brain. Scanning electron
microscopy micrographs revealed that GMSs maintained the three-dimensional shape for more than
5 days in normal brain but were degraded rapidly in the post-ischemic brain, presumably due to high levels of gelatinase induction. After encapsulation with GMS, the duration of OPN release was markedly
extended; from the period of 2 days to 5 days in normal brain, and from 2 days to 4 days in the postischemic brain; these encompass the critical period for recovery processes, such as vascularization,
and controlling inﬂammation. Together, these results indicate that GMS-mediated drug delivery has huge
potential when it was used in the hyperacute period in the post-ischemic brain.

such as Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2 (BMP-2) [3,4], Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) [4] and Fibroblast Growth Factor
(FGF) [5], stem cell [6] and plasmids [7] into tissues of the body to
facilitate tissue regeneration and remodeling. Drug molecules
bound to the gelatin matrix are released as gelatin degrades enzymatically, and therefore the release proﬁle can be tailored by controlling the cross-linking density and surface-to-volume ratio, i.e.
size, of the GMS [8,9]. However, this approach has been frustrated
due to the polydispersity of the GMSs fabricated by conventional
methods, such as emulsion or spray drying. To this end, the electric-ﬁeld-assisted precision particle fabrication (E-PPF) method

Y. Jin et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 10 (2014) 3126–3135

has been developed, enabling the fabrication of hydrogel
microspheres, including GMSs, of controlled size [10]. Recently,
we reported the encapsulation of High Mobility Group Box 1
(HMGB1) A box in GMS fabricated via the E-PPF method, demonstrating that the GMS encapsulation markedly enhanced the neuroprotective effects of HMGB1 A box in the post-ischemic brain
[11].
Osteopontin (OPN) is a phosphorylated glycoprotein, which is a
soluble cytokine capable of stimulating signal transduction pathways in many different types of cells [12–14]. OPN is up-regulated
in the post-ischemic brain [15,16] and plays a protective role due
to its anti-inﬂammatory, neurogenic and nerve guidance effects
[17–19]. OPN was induced in a delayed manner in stroke animal
models [15,16], beginning from 24 h and peaking at 5 days; however, supplementing OPN during the early period substantially
suppressed infarct formation and mitigated neuronal damage
[20,21], indicating a more active role of OPN in a hyperacute period
of post-ischemic brain.
To understand the optimal effects of GMS-mediated drug
delivery in pathological brains, it is critical to ensure a pathology-reﬂected delivery of encapsulated protein in the pathological
brains. This study was undertaken to examine the neuroprotective
efﬁcacy of recombinant human OPN encapsulated in GMSs in a rat
model of focal cerebral ischemia. In addition, we presented the
degradation proﬁles of GMSs in the normal and post-ischemic
brain as determined using scanning electron micrographs, and
the actual amounts of OPN released from GMSs into the parenchyma of normal and ischemic brain, demonstrating the usefulness
of GMSs to elaborate the neuroprotective potency of OPN in the
post-ischemic brain in a hyperacute period.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Fabrication of GMS
Type A gelatin (300 g, bloom; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was
used to fabricate GMSs (diameter 25 lm) using the E-PPF method,
as previously described [8,10,11]. Cross-linking was performed
using 0.03125% (w/w) of glutaraldehyde (GA) (Sigma Aldrich, St
Louis, MO) solution at 4 °C for 24 h, which was followed by
quenching with glycine (Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature.
The resulting GMSs were washed with deionized water and lyophilized. GMSs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Hitachi S-4300SE, Hitachi, Japan).
2.2. Preparation of recombinant human OPN-loaded GMSs (rhOPN/
GMS)
Recombinant human OPN (rhOPN, R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN) was encapsulated in GMSs by adding an aqueous solution of
rhOPN (0.25 mg ml 1) to dry GMS, and then allowing the suspension to stand for 2 h at room temperature. Just prior to injection,
sterile phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4) was added to make
the total volume of 2.5 ll for each rat. As a control, unloaded dry
microspheres were hydrated by adding sterile PBS and the suspension was incubated for 2 h at room temperature and ﬁnal injection
volume was adjusted to 2.5 ll for each rat by adding PBS prior to
injection. Encapsulation efﬁciency was determined by using a solid-phase sandwich ELISA kit (IBL, Fujioka, Japan). In brief, an aqueous solution of rhOPN (0.25 mg ml 1) was added to dry GMS at
various ratios (10, 50, 100, 200 ng rhOPN to 100 lg GMS) and then
allowing the suspension to stand for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the OPN/GMSs mixture was washed with distilled water
(50 ll) two times to remove non-encapsulated rhOPN and supernatants were collected after each washing. After centrifuging at

3127

1000 rpm for 1 min, the supernatant was withdrawn and amounts
of rhOPN in the total collected supernatant were measured using
the ELISA kit. The loading efﬁciency of rhOPN/GMSs was calculated
using the following formula: Loading efﬁciency (%) = (total
rhOPN rhOPN in supernatant)/total rhOPN  100.
2.3. Treatment with rhOPN or rhOPN/GMS
Rats were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of a
mixture of ketamine (3.75 mg/100 g body weight) and xylazine
hydrochloride (0.5 mg/100 g body weight), and placed on a stereotaxic apparatus (Narishige Scientiﬁc Instrument Lab., Tokyo,
Japan). The skull was leveled between bregma and lambda. rhOPN
or rhOPN/GMS was injected stereotaxically into the striatum (bregma coordinates (mm): AP, 0.2; ML, 4.0; DV, 5.0) using a 26-G
Hamilton microsyringe (80330, Hamilton Company, Reno, NV). For
the dose test, 10, 50, 100 or 200 ng of rhOPN was administered at
1 h post-middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). For the temporal test, naked rhOPN (100 ng) or rhOPN/GMS (100 ng/100 lg) was
administered 24 h prior to or 1, 6 or 12 h post-MCAO. For the SEM
study, a GMS (500 lg)/saline mixture (total 5 ll) was administered
at 1 h post-MCAO and for ELISA, naked rhOPN (250 ng) or GMSs
(100 lg) loaded with rhOPN (250 ng) was injected at 1 h postMCAO. To examine long-term protective effects, naked rhOPN
(100 ng) or rhOPN/GMS (100 ng/100 lg) was injected at 6 h
post-MCAO.
2.4. Surgical procedure used for MCAO
Male Sprague–Dawley rats were housed under diurnal lighting
conditions and allowed food and tap water ad libitum. All animal
studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations made in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals published by the National Institute of Health and performed in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines (http://www.
nc3rs.org/ARRIVE). The animal protocol used in this study was
reviewed and approved by the INHA University-Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (INHA-IACUC) with respect to
ethicality (Approval Number INHA-110321-81). MCAO was carried
out as previously described [22]. In brief, male Sprague–Dawley
rats (250–300 g) were anesthetized with 5% isoﬂurane in 30%
oxygen/70% nitrous oxide and maintained using 0.5% isoﬂurane in
the same gas mixture during surgery. Occlusion of the right middle
carotid artery was induced for 1 h by advancing a nylon suture
(4–0; AILEE, Busan, South Korea) with a heat-induced bulb at the
tip (0.3 mm in diameter) along the internal carotid artery for
20–22 mm from the bifurcation of the external carotid artery,
which was followed by reperfusion for up to 14 days. The left femoral artery was cannulated for blood sampling to analyze pH, PaO2,
PaCO2 and blood glucose concentration (I-STAT; Sensor Devises,
Waukesha, WI). Regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) was monitored
using a laser Doppler ﬂowmeter (Periﬂux System 5000; Perimed,
Jarfalla, Sweden) and the success of occlusion was considered if
P70% reduction in cortical CBF occurred immediately after inserting an occluding suture. Animals were excluded if they failed to
reduce CBF to less than 30% of the baseline during the MCAO or
to restore the blood ﬂow during the reperfusion. A thermoregulated heating pad and a heating lamp were used to maintain a rectal
temperature of 37 ± 0.5 °C during surgery. Animals were randomly
allocated to a sham (n = 12), MCAO (n = 63), MCAO + GMS-treated
(n = 34), MCAO + rhOPN-treated (n = 56) or MCAO + rhOPN/GMStreated (n = 35) group. Animals allocated to the sham group underwent identical procedures for skin incisions, a hole formation and
stereotaxic manipulation but not MCA occlusion. In general,
mortality was not observed during the surgery. However, the mortality after surgery is 7.4% (5 out of 68), which might be caused by a

3128

large infarct volume. No signiﬁcant difference in mortality was detected between control-MCAO, MCAO/GMS (5.6%, 2 out of 36),
MCAO/rhOPN (8.2%, 5 out of 61) and MCAO/rhOPN/GMS (5.4%, 2
out of 37).

visualized at 15 kV in a Hitachi S-4300SE SEM (Hitachi S-4300SE,
Hitachi, Japan).

2.5. Infarct volume assessments

To detect rhOPN in rat brain, we used a solid-phase sandwich
ELISA kit (IBL, Fujioka, Japan). ELISA plates were coated with afﬁnity puriﬁed rabbit anti-human OPN (O-17), which reacts with the
N-terminal region of human OPN (IPVKQADSGSSEEKQ). Whole cell
lysates prepared from tissue block (2  2  2 mm3, black box in
Fig. 6A,) and standard samples were diluted with 1% bovine serum
albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS and applied to ELISA plates.
After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, wells were washed seven times
with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate buffer. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-human OPN antibody (10A16), which
reacted with the KSKKFRRPDIQYPDATDE site, was then added and
incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing nine times, tetramethyl
benzidine buffer was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, 1 N sulfuric acid was used as a stop solution.
Absorbances were measured at 450 nm using an ELISA reader.

Coronally sectioned (2 mm) brain slices were immediately
stained by 1% 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) (37 °C
for 15 min), and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Infarcted tissue
areas were measured using the Scion Image program (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD). To correct for edema in the brain following
ischemia, measured infarct area was adjusted by multiplying ratios
between areas of the ipsilateral hemisphere and area of the contralateral hemisphere. Infarct volumes were calculated (in mm3) by
summing the infarct sizes of each infarct-containing tissue section.
2.6. Modiﬁed neurological severity scores
Neurological deﬁcits were evaluated using modiﬁed the neurological severity score (mNSS) at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 or 14 days postMCAO. The mNSS system consists of motor, sensory, balance and
reﬂex tests, all of which are graded using a scale of 0 to 18 (normal: 0, maximal deﬁcit: 18) [23], where higher scores represent
more severe injury. Motor scores were determined by awarding
scores to two items (1) suspending a rat by its tail and awarding
a score of zero or one for each of the following (total score 0–3);
forelimb ﬂexion, hindlimb ﬂexion, head movement by >10° with
respect to the vertical axis within 30 s; and (2) placing a rat on
the ﬂoor and awarding scores from zero to three for each of the
following: normal walking, 0; inability to walk straight, 1; circling
toward the paretic side, 2; or falling on the paretic side, 3. Sensory
tests included a placing test (score 0–1) and a proprioceptive test
(score 0–1). The beam balance test was used to test balance and
scores from zero to six were allocated as follows: balancing with
a steady posture, 0; grasping the side of the beam, 1; hugging
the beam with one limb off the beam, 2; hugging the beam with
two limbs off the beam or rotating around the beam for over
60 s, 3; attempting to balance on the beam but falling off within
20 to 40 s, 4; attempting to balance on the beam but falling off
within 20 s, 5; or making no attempt to balance or hang onto the
beam, 6. Reﬂex testing scores were determined by awarding scores
to the following four items (total score 0–4): pinna reﬂex, 0–1;
corneal reﬂex, 0–1; startle reﬂex, 0–1; seizures, myoclonus or
myodystony, 0–1.

2.9. ELISA

2.10. Statistical analysis
Two-sample comparisons were performed using the Student’s t
test, while multiple comparisons were made using one-way or
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a post hoc test
to compare selected pairs of data. PRISM software 5.0 (GraphPad
Software) was used to perform statistical analysis. All data are presented as means ± SEM and statistical difference was accepted at
the 5% level.

2.7. Rota-rod test
24 h before MCAO, rats were conditioned on a rota-rod unit at a
constant 3 rpm until they were able to remain on the rotating spindle for 180 s. One day after MCAO, each rat was subjected to a test
trial on the rota-rod at 5 rpm, and 1 and 2 h later, residence times
on the rota-rod were measured at 10 and 15 rpm.
2.8. Sample preparation for SEM
Brains were ﬁxed with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and
1% GA by transcardiac perfusion and post-ﬁxed in the same solution overnight at 4 °C. In each case, the required brain region
around the injection site was obtained and placed in a 1.5 ml tube.
Specimens were then washed three times with 0.1 M phosphate
buffer, ﬁxed with 1% osmic acid for 1 h, washed three times with
phosphate buffer and dehydrated using an ethanol series (50, 70,
80, 90, 95%; each 15 min), which was followed by treatment with
100% ethanol two times for 60 min. Specimens were dried at room
temperature, sputter-coated with a 10 nm platinum layer and

3. Results
3.1. Neuroprotective effect of rhOPN in the post-ischemic brain
The protective effects of OPN were investigated in the postischemic brain (60 min of MCAO). rhOPN (10, 50, 100 or 200 ng)
was administered into the striatum using a stereotaxic apparatus
(bregma coordinates (mm): AP, 0.2; ML, 4.0; DV, 5.0) at 1 h
post-MCAO and infarct volumes were assessed at 2 days postMCAO. Mean infarct volumes after the administration of rhOPN
at 10, 50, 100 or 200 ng were found to be reduced to 42.1 ± 6.3%
(n = 5, P < 0.01), 32.1 ± 4.8% (n = 6, P < 0.01), 18.2 ± 1.4% (n = 7,
P < 0.01) and 24.4 ± 2.3% (n = 7, P < 0.01) of the untreated MCAO
control levels, respectively (Fig. 1A and B), demonstrating that
the neuroprotective effects increased in a rhOPN-dose dependent
manner, with a maximal effect at 100 ng.
3.2. Enhanced neuroprotective potency of rhOPN by GMS in the postischemic brain
To compare the neuroprotective potency of rhOPN delivered via
GMS with that of naked rhOPN and to understand potential neuroprotective effects of OPN in the early critical period before endogenous OPN is induced, we employed GMSs 25 lm in diameter,

3129

cross-linked with 0.03125% GA, which would exhibit quick yet sustainable rhOPN release characteristics. rhOPN (100 ng) was encapsulated in 100 lg GMS (rhOPN/GMS) and administered into the
striatum using a stereotaxic apparatus (bregma coordinates
(mm): AP, 0.2; ML, 4.0; DV, 5.0) (arrow in Fig. 2A) 24 h prior
to or 1, 6 or 12 h post-MCAO (Fig. 2A). Encapsulation efﬁciency,
which was measured using human OPN-speciﬁc ELISA, was 97.2%
when 100 ng rhOPN was encapsulated in 100 lg GMS (Fig. 2B)
and they were over 96% when 10, 50 or 200 ng rhOPN was used
(Fig. 2B). Administration of naked rhOPN or of rhOPN/GMS significantly suppressed the infarct volume at all time points examined
(Fig. 2C and D). Moreover, mean infarct volumes were reduced by
rhOPN/GMS to 32.6 ± 6.8% (n = 5, P < 0.01), 33.8 ± 8.8% (n = 8,
P < 0.01) and 64.8 ± 14.9% (n = 7, P < 0.05) of that in untreated control animals when it was administered 24 h prior to or 6 or 12 h
after MCAO, respectively, which was signiﬁcantly lower than the
mean infarct volumes in animals treated with naked rhOPN
(77.1 ± 5.2%, 63.7 ± 10.0% and 84.5 ± 5.4%, respectively) (Fig. 2C
and D). Results indicated that the delivery of OPN during this acute
period resulted in beneﬁcial effects in the post-ischemic brain and
the encapsulation remarkably enhanced its neuroproective effects
at all time points examined except 1 h post-MCAO, wherein mean
infarction volume was reduced to 15.4 ± 2.1% or 18.2 ± 1.4% by
rhOPN/GMS or naked rhOPN, respectively (Fig. 2C and D). No

infarct suppression was observed in animals administered with
blank-GMS (Fig. 2C), conﬁrming that GMS itself has no therapeutic
role. Physiological parameters, namely pH, PaO2, PaCO2 and blood
glucose, were similar in rhOPN/GMS-treated and untreated animals (Table 1).
3.3. Motor impairment and neurological deﬁcits reductions by rhOPN/
GMS in post-MCAO
When naked rhOPN (100 ng) was administered at 24 h prior to
or at 6 post-MCAO, mean modiﬁed neurological severity scores
(mNSSs) at 2 days post-MCAO were 10.0 ± 1.4 (n = 6) or 9.7 ± 2.1
(n = 6), respectively, which were signiﬁcantly lower than
12.0 ± 1.0 (n = 6) of untreated MCAO controls (Fig. 3A). However,
mNSS was not decreased by 12 h post-treatment of naked rhOPN.
In contrast, mNSSs were markedly reduced by rhOPN encapsulated
in GMS at all time points examined, including 12 h post-treatment,
and its effects were much stronger than that by naked rhOPN
(Fig. 3A). Motor activities were assessed using the rota-rod test
at a speed of 5 rpm. Initially, we conﬁrmed that sham-operated

and treatment naïve controls exhibited no performance differences
on the rota-rod test compared to normal animals. Furthermore,
rhOPN/GMS administered to naïve controls caused no differences
in rota-rod performance (data not shown). Administration of naked
rhOPN (100 ng) at 6 h post-MCAO, but not at 24 h pre- or 12 h
post-MCAO, signiﬁcantly improved the performance in the rotarod test with the speed of 5 rpm, whereas rhOPN/GMS improved
the rota-rod performance at all time points examined, indicating
that its effects were much stronger than that by naked rhOPN
(Fig. 3B). At 10 or 15 rpm, the improvement of the rota-rod performance by naked rhOPN was not signiﬁcant at all time points examined, whereas the improvement by rhOPN/GMS was signiﬁcant at
pre-MCAO-24 h, post-MCAO-6 h and post-MCAO-12 h (for
15 rpm) and its effect was stronger than that by naked rhOPN
(Fig. 3C and D).
3.4. Gradual degradation of GMS in the normal rat brain
To uncover the GMS degradation proﬁles in normal and postischemic brain, SEM micrographs were followed. GMSs in saline

were administered stereotaxically into the striatum of the normal
rat brain (bregma coordinates (mm): AP, 0.2; ML, 4.0; DV, 5.0).
1 h after administration, GMSs were detected in the striatum singly
or as aggregations (Fig. 4A). They exhibited smooth surfaces and a
homogenous size distribution (range of 25–30 lm diameter)

(Fig. 4A and B). 1 day after administration, the GMS surfaces appeared rough and a few small dimples were observed (Fig. 4D)
and at 4 days, numerous large craters were detected (Fig. 4E).
These changes then accelerated and at 5 days post-administration,
craters were getting larger and deeper (Fig. 4F and G), and

3132

subsequently, the particles rapidly degraded and collapsed (Fig. 4H
and I), and almost completely fragmented at 14 days (Fig. 4J).
These results revealed that the GMSs degraded gradually in normal
brain.
3.5. Rapid degradation of GMSs in the post-ischemic brain
Interestingly, the degradation kinetics of GMSs administered to
the post-ischemic brain at 1 h post-MCAO differed markedly from
that seen in the normal brain. GMSs were administered stereotaxically at 1 h post-MCAO. At 1 h after administration, the GMSs detected in the striatum remained patent and their characteristics,
including size and surface smoothness, were not different from
those observed in the normal brain (Fig. 5B). However, at 1 day
post-administration, their surfaces were rough and wrinkled and
were covered with numerous large dimples (Fig. 5C). These
changes progressed further at 4 days post-administration (Fig. 5D

and E) and GMSs had almost completely collapsed at 5 days
(Fig. 5F) and fragmented into small pieces at 7 days (Fig. 5G and
H). More rapid GMSs degradation in the post-ischemic brain than
in normal brain might be attributable to the high levels of gelatinase expression in the post-ischemic brain [24]. Furthermore, the
different degradation kinetics in the post-ischemic brain and
normal brain were in line with the release proﬁle of rhOPN (see
Fig. 6).
3.6. Sustained and long-lasting OPN delivery using GMSs in the postischemic brain
The release proﬁle of rhOPN from the GMS in normal and postischemic brains was examined after rhOPN/GMS administration.
GMSs (100 lg) loaded with rhOPN (250 ng) were injected into
the striatum (Fig. 6A, arrow) and human OPN-speciﬁc ELISA was
used to assess levels of exogenously administered rhOPN in brain
tissue and to avoid interference from endogenous rat OPN. 1 h after
naked rhOPN administration, human OPN protein was detected
(5196 ng g 1 tissue) in rat brain (Fig. 6B) adjacent to the injection
site (indicated as a black box in Fig. 6A). RhOPN levels were decreased gradually thereafter and at 2 days post-administration,
rhOPN was detected at a barely detectable level (84.48 ng g 1 tissue) and at 4 and 5 days, it was not detected by ELISA (Fig. 6B).
On the other hand, after rhOPN/GMS administration, rhOPN level
(1470 ng g 1 tissue) at 1 h was signiﬁcantly lower than that of
naked rhOPN; however, these levels were signiﬁcantly enhanced
at 12 h and further enhanced at 1 day post-administration
(Fig. 6B). Since then, the levels of rhOPN were decreased slowly
until 5 days in the normal brain (Fig. 6B). Strikingly, in the
post-ischemic brain, rhOPN was released more rapidly both in
rhOPN- or rhOPN/GMS-administered animals (Fig. 6C); however,
the overall release patterns emulated those obtained from the
normal brain. In particular, in rhOPN/GMS-administered animals,
rhOPN protein was detected at 1640 ng g 1 tissue at 1 h and a
moderate burst of rhOPN occurred around 12 h and this was
followed by a slow and sustained release until day 4 (Fig. 6C).
Together, these results indicate that rapid but sustained rhOPN
delivery was obtained by encapsulating it into GMSs and suggest
that the delivery of rhOPN during this acute period might be
responsible for the robust neuroprotective effect observed in the
post-ischemic brain (Fig. 2).
3.7. Long-term protective effects of rhOPN encapsulated in the
post-ischemic brain

(250 ng/100 lg) was administered stereotaxically (bregma coordinates (mm): AP,
0.2; ML, 4.0; DV, 5.0) (arrow in A) into normal brain (B) or post-ischemic brain
at 1 h post-MCAO (C), and ELISA for rhOPN was carried out at 1 and 12 h and at 1, 2,
4 and 5 days after administration. Protein samples were prepared from the
indicated region near the injection site (black box in A). Data are presented as

MCAO rats (n = 15); MCAO + rhOPN/GMS, GMS-encapsulated rhOPN-treated MCAO
rats (n = 15). Numbers in each bar present the number of animals examined.

Since rhOPN release from rOPN/GMS peaked at 12 h and was
maintained for several days, we examined the longer-term neuroprotective effect of rhOPN/GMS. RhOPN (100 ng) was administered
at 6 h post-MCAO, modiﬁed neurological severity scores (mNSSs)
were determined at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 14 days post-MCAO
(Fig. 7A). mNSSs induced by MCAO were recovered in a timedependent manner in the absence of treatment, but the deﬁcit
was signiﬁcantly present at 14 days after operation (Fig. 7B).
Administration of naked rhOPN or rhOPN/GMS at 6 h post-MCAO
further improved the neurological deﬁcits of MCAO animals at all
time points examined (Fig. 7B). In improving neurological deﬁcit,
rhOPN/GMS was more effective than naked rhOPN at 1, 3, 5 and
7 days (Fig. 7B). In contrast, no changes in mNSS or rota-rod test
scores were detected for empty GMS-treated MCAO control,
MCAO + GMS, at all time points examined, indicating that GMS
itself has no protective or detrimental effect. In the rota-rod test,
the rota-rod performance at 5 and 10 rpm, but not at 15 rpm,
was also gradually recovered in the absence of treatment
(Fig. 7C–E). Similarly, mean time spent on the rota-rod (5 rpm)
by rhOPN/GMS-treated MCAO animals was signiﬁcantly greater

than that of the rhOPN-treated animals at almost all time points,
including 14 days (Fig. 7C). Rota-rod test scores at 10 rpm were
also signiﬁcantly better for the animals treated with rhOPN/GMS
than those with free rhOPN; however, no signiﬁcant improvement
was detected at 15 rpm (Fig. 7D and E). Sustained behavioral
improvement after the rhOPN/GMS treatment at 14 days suggests
that continuous OPN release might contribute to a long-term
effect.

4. Discussion
The present study demonstrates that the sustained delivery of
rhOPN obtained by encapsulation with GMS remarkably enhanced
its neuroprotective potency in the post-ischemic brain. The administration of 100 ng of rhOPN/GMS at 1 h post-MCAO reduced the
mean infarct volume by 81.8% of that of the untreated MCAO
control and extended the therapeutic window at least to 12 h
post-MCAO (Fig. 2). Encapsulation with GMSs maintained the
OPN release for more than 5 days in normal brain, whereas GMSs
were degraded more rapidly in the post-ischemic brain, probably
due to gelatinase induction. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst report of the time-dependent protein release proﬁles from
GMSs, particularly in the post-ischemic brain.
Regarding the therapeutic application of OPN, many researchers
have examined the merit of the exogenous administration of
recombinant OPN protein [21,25–27]. Interestingly, however, in
OPN-deﬁcient mice, the infarct volume measured at 24 h after

transient MCAO was not changed [17], which can be explained
by the delayed OPN induction as reported previously in various
animal models of ischemia [15,28,29]. In animal models of permanent focal ischemia, OPN protein was expressed mainly by microglia from 24 h, with peaking at day 5 [15,28]. Similarly, in a rat
model of transient forebrain ischemia, OPN protein was induced
in microglia from 24 h after reperfusion and peaked at 3 days,
and its induction in reactive astrocytes was observed as late as at
10 days [9]. However, supplementing OPN during a hyperacute
period (that is, immediately before or after MCAO or 10 min
post-MCAO) substantially suppressed infarct formation and mitigated neuronal damage [21,27], suggesting that OPN plays a more
active role during this period. The results of the present study corroborate the notion that delivery of OPN during this acute period
warrants beneﬁcial effects in the post-ischemic brain (Fig. 2). Since
OPN exerts neuroprotective effects by inducing anti-inﬂammatory,
neurogenic and nerve guidance effects in the ischemic brain [17–
19], the rapid and sustained release of OPN from GMSs shown in
the present study likely enhances its neuroprotective effects via
the similar mechanism. Although therapeutic potency of GMSmediated OPN delivery was similar to the naked OPN treatment
at 1 h post MCAO (Fig. 2D), it is possible that combination treatment with naked OPN or treatment of OPN encapsulated with
other GMSs with fast-releasing characteristics will strengthen
therapeutic beneﬁts.
After encapsulation, the duration of OPN release was
markedly extended from the period of 2 days to 5 days in normal
brain and from 2 days to 4 days in the post-ischemic brain. In the

3134

Y. Jin et al. / Acta Biomaterialia 10 (2014) 3126–3135

post-ischemic brain, the 4-day period encompasses a critical period for recovery processes, such as vascularization, and controlling
inﬂammation in the post-ischemic brain. Therefore, we speculate
that GMS-mediated delivery is beneﬁcial under pathophysiological
conditions, and particularly when long-term drug delivery is required. In the present study, the long-term beneﬁt of GMS-mediated OPN delivery was observed in neurological and rota-rod
tests (Fig. 7), which suggests that treatment of GMS-mediated
OPN even at 6 h post-MCAO was sufﬁcient to afford behavioral
improvement. However, weak effects in the neurological test and
weak or no effects at the high speed of the rota-rod test suggest
that the therapeutic window at 6 h post-MCAO is somewhat too
late to afford a signiﬁcant improvement or neurological improvement for high levels of behavioral performance, since it requires
a longer time to completely reconstruct the neural circuits. Despite
this point, the remarkable neuroprotective effect of rhOPN/GMS
in vivo accessed at 2 days post-MCAO and its sustained effects on
neurological deﬁcits and motor activities up to 14 days post-MCAO
support the feasibility of the GMS encapsulation approach with respect to enhancing the stability of the delivered protein and to sustaining its delivery to the injured brain.
In addition to the duration of drug release, the distribution of a
delivered drug also inﬂuences its therapeutic potency. It was interesting to note that infarct formation was suppressed by rhOPN not
only around injection sites in the striatum but in the cerebral cortex, which was some distance removed from the injection points
and separated from the striatum by the corpus callosum
(Fig. 1B). Although the mechanism underlying this remote effect
remains to be studied, it could have been due to the migration of
rhOPN/GMS or of rhOPN released by GMSs or a combination of
the two.
In the post-ischemic brain, the use of GMSs appears to offer an
attractive means of achieving the controlled release of target proteins, because gelatinases are expressed at high levels in infarcted
and peri-infarcted regions [24]. Gelatinase A (MMP-2) levels increase soon after ischemia, which causes early reversible opening
of the blood–brain barrier, followed by a marked surge in gelatinase B (MMP-9) levels and extensive blood vessel damage [30]. As a
result, drug release from GMSs, modulated by cross-linking, was
more rapid in the post-ischemic brain than in normal brain, which
may vary depending on the brain regions. Although there is a concern regarding its possible cytotoxic effects, the low concentration
of GA used in this study to cross-link GMS (0.03125%) probably has
no or minimal adverse effects in vivo [31]. Furthermore, we found
that physiological parameters, such as, pH, PaO2, PaCO2 and blood
glucose, remained unchanged after the GMS administration in normal and ischemic animals (Table 1).
5. Conclusion
Delivery of OPN via biodegradable GMSs markedly enhanced
the neuroprotective potency of OPN in the post-ischemic brain
by rapid and sustained OPN release from GMSs. GMS-mediated
drug delivery has a huge potential given current research efforts
on genetically engineered peptides, cells and plasmids. Furthermore, combination treatments with other therapeutic means,
simultaneously or in a spatiotemporally controlled manner, are
likely to further enhance the therapeutic beneﬁts conferred by gelatin microsphere delivery. However, the present study is primarily
based on the animal model with the limited numbers of animals
used. It is also possible that there is a difference in stroke-induced
induction levels of gelatinases in the brain between mice and
humans. Therefore, there might be a potential limitation to apply
to clinical trials and further studies with larger cohorts will be necessary to reach optimized therapeutics in the use of GMS-mediated
delivery.
