Cerebral ischemic stroke has long been recognized as a prevalent and serious neurological disease
that was associated with high mortality and morbidity. However, the current therapeutic protocols
remain suboptimal with major mechanisms underlying stroke urgently warranted. Inhibitor of DNA
binding/differentiation 2 (Id2) is found to be up-regulated in neuronal cells following hypoxia/ischemia
(H/I). This study was aimed to investigate whether knockdown of Id2 in neuronal cells could protect
them from hypoxic and ischemic injury both in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometric analysis was employed
to assess neuronal apoptosis in CoCl2 -treated neuroblastoma B35 cells engineered to overexpress or
knockdown Id2 expression. In vivo knockdown of Id2 was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats by a single intracerebroventricular injection of Cy3-labeled and cholesterol-modiﬁed Id2-siRNA. We found that
knockdown of Id2 attenuated H/I-induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro while overexpression of Id2 produced an opposite effect. In a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), in vivo knockdown
of Id2 signiﬁcantly improved neurological deﬁcits, reduced the volume of ischemic infarction and diminished the neuronal apoptosis in the penumbra area. Double immunoﬂuorescence staining showed less
co-localization of retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb)-Id2 but greater co-localization of RbE2F1 in the penumbra area. Cell cycle assay further demonstrated that Id2 knockdown induced G0/G1
cell cycle arrest in CoCl2 -treated B35 cells. The present data support the implication of Id2 in the modulation of H/I-induced neuronal apoptosis and may provide a potential therapeutic option to protect brain
tissues from ischemic injury by inhibition of its expression.

1. Introduction
Cerebral ischemic stroke has long been recognized as a prevalent and serious neurological disease that was associated with
high mortality and morbidity [1]. The pathophysiology of ischemic
stroke is complicated and multifactorial. Although signiﬁcant
advances over the past two decades have been made with
respect to treatment with thrombolytics, anticoagulant therapy,

L. Guo et al. / Behavioural Brain Research 292 (2015) 528–536

carotid endarterectomy, neuroprotective agents, etc., the current
therapeutic protocols remain suboptimal and frustrating [2–4].
Therefore, the search for critical mechanisms behind stroke pathophysiology and identiﬁcation of novel molecular targets for more
effective therapy are still urgently sought.
Accumulating evidence has suggested that neuronal apoptosis
plays an important role in cell loss following acute ischemic damage
through activation of various signaling pathways including p53 [5],
JNK [6], c-jun [7], p38 [8], CDK-5 [9]. However, the precise mechanism that could trigger activation of apoptotic pathway in the
injured brain is yet to be fully elucidated [10,11]. Inhibitor of DNA
binding/differentiation 2 (Id2) belongs to the Id protein family that
functions as transcriptional modulator [12]. During neuronal development, Id2 could counteract the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
protein (pRb) in the neuronal differentiation probably by scavenging its downstream E-box HLH proteins [13]. Further studies in
transgenic models showed that Id2 might be inactivated by pRb and
acts as its downstream effector [14]. Conversely, overexpression
of Id2 in precursors of cortical neurons resulted in differentiation
failure and cell death while coexpression of pRb neutralized this
effect [15]. While pRb could interact with a wide variety of proteins,
the cell cycle-related transcription factor E2F1 is the best known
target of pRb. In quiescent cells such as neurons, hypophosphorylated pRb binds to E2F1 and inhibits its transcriptional activity
[16]. In contrast, when cells undergo G1–S phase transition, pRb
becomes hyperphosphorylated. A large body of work has indicated
that Rb hyperphosphorylation results in the release and activation
of E2F1 [17,18]. The E2F1 transcription factor execute various cellular function including control of cell proliferation and apoptosis
[19,20].
A direct evidence supporting a role of Id2 in regulation of
neuronal cell death that Id2 is an inducible gene in response to
apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons induced by serum and
potassium, and targeted deletion of the Id2 gene in neurons protects against apoptosis [21]. Our recent work demonstrated that
Id2 was up-regulated in neuronal cells following hypoxia/ischemia
(H/I) [22]. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether
knockdown of Id2 in neuronal cells could protect them from
hypoxic and ischemic injury both in vitro and in vivo.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cell culture
The rat neuroblastoma B35 cell line (ATCC, CRL-2754) has
been proved to be an appropriate cell model for investigation of
H/I-induced neuronal injury [22,23]. The B35 cells were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagles’s medium (DMEM) (Boster) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed atomsphere with 5%
CO2 .
2.2. Id2-siRNA and transfections
Based on the sequence of Id2 mRNA, three chemically synthetic siRNAs were made from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China).
siRNA1: sense strand, GAAGGUGACCAAGAUGGAAAUdTdT;
antisense strand, AUUUCCAUCUUGGUCACCUUCdTdT; siRNA2:
sense
strand,
CAUGAACGACUGCUACUCCdTdT;
antisense
strand, GGAGUAGCAGUCGUUCAUGdTdT; siRNA3: sense strand,
CUUCUGAGCUUAUGUCGAAdTdT; antisense strand, UUCGACAUAAGCUCAGAAGdTdT; siRNA scrambled control: sense strand,
UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt; antisense strand, ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAtt. B35 cells were plated in 24-well plates one day
before transfection, and then transfected with the siRNA separately

529

using TransPass R1 transfection reagent (NEB, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions [24].
The 5 and 3 end of the antisense strand was labeled with Fluorophore Cy3 and modiﬁed with cholesterol respectively (RiboBio,
Guangzhou, China). siRNA containing the mismatched sequence of
Id2 mRNA (misRNA for Id2) was used as a negative control. misRNA: sense strand, UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt; antisense strand:
ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAAtt.
2.3. Construction of Id2-expressinglentiviral vector and lentivirus
transduction
A full-length rat Id2 cDNA was subcloned into pGMLV-PB1-1
and sequence veriﬁed. The empty vector was used as negative control. To produce lentivirus, LentiX-293T cells (Clontech)
were co-transfected with the Id2 cDNA-containing vector pGMLVPB1-Id2 and lentiviral packaging genes contained in Lenti-XHTX
Packaging Mix using the Xfect transfection reagent (Clontech). The
resulting lentiviruses were concentrated to a titer of 108 /ml and
used to transduce B35 cells.
2.4. Hypoxia-mimetic by CoCl2 and ﬂow cytometric analysis
Cells were treated with 250 ␮M CoCl2 for 12 h and analyzed by
ﬂow cytometry to tract membane and nuclear events suggestive
of apoptosis as previous studies [23]. A two-color analysis of FITClabeled binding and propidium iodide (PI) uptake was performed
using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Beyotime).
2.5. Animals and surgery
Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were obtained from
the Experimental Animal Center of Renji Hospital, School of
Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University. The animal study was
approved by the institutional Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation and conducted in compliance with the Guidelines for
Animal Experimentation of this institution. All the experiments
were carried out in accordance with the EU directive 2010/63/EU
on the protection of animals used for scientiﬁc purposes.
The animals were randomly divided into the following groups
(n = 8 for each group): siRNA group (Id2-siRNA intraventricular
injection), misRNA group (misRNA intraventricular injection), NaCl
group (0.9% NaCl intraventricular injection) and NS group (normal
control, without intraventricular injection). Rats anesthetized with
i.p. injection of 50 mg/kg pentobarbital were placed in a stereotaxic
instrument (ASI Company, USA). A 28-gauge stainless steel injection cannula was paved into the right lateral ventricle as previously
described [25]. Then the rats received a single injection of Id2-siRNA
or misRNA or 0.9% NaCl at a rate of 0.5 ␮l/min using a micorinfusion
pump and a 10 ␮l microsyringe. Once the infusion was done, the
cannula remained in place for 5 min, then withdrawn at a rate of
1 mm/min. One day after the injection, all the rats were performed
with the operation of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO).
The surgical operation for MCAO was performed as previously
reported [22]. Brieﬂy, a 3-0 monoﬁlament nylon suture (Beijing
Shadong Industrial Corp., China) was introduced into the right
internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery until a slight
resistance was encountered. The suture was left in place for 90 min
and removed to facilitate reperfusion.
2.6. Assessment of neurological deﬁcits
The scales from 0 to 4 were utilized to evaluate the effects of
MCAO on neurological behavior at 24 h and 72 h after the treatment [26,27]. The neurological deﬁcit testing was performed by

530

L. Guo et al. / Behavioural Brain Research 292 (2015) 528–536

two observers individually who were blinded to the assignments
of four groups.

Reagents (GE Healthcare, USA). ␤-actin served as loading control.

2.7. Cortex tissue collection and sectioning

2.11. TUNEL assay

At different times after MCAO administration, the animals
were anesthetized by i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbital at
100 mg/kg. For Id2 mRNA and protein expression, the rats were
perfused transcardially with 4 ◦ C normal saline, and the brain
regions that corresponded to the ischemic core and penumbra were dissected on ice according to a previous method [22].
For TUNEL staining and immunostaining, the rats were perfused transcardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, pH 7.4)
following 4 ◦ C normal saline. Upon removal, the brains were
post-ﬁxed in 4% PFA and immediately cryoprotected in 20 and
30% sucrose solution sequentially. A series of coronal sections
(25 ␮m) were made between −1.80 and −4.80 mm bregma levels.
Every ﬁfth section totaling 24 sections was used for the staining.

Apoptosis was evaluated on the sections of the cerebral cortices of penumbra area mounted on slides using the Roche TUNEL
staining kit (Penzberg, Germany) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The TUNEL-positive cells were counted in ﬁve randomized areas per rat brain and expressed as the number of
positively stained cells per square millimeter.

2.8. Infarct volume measurement
72 h after MCAO, the rat brain tissues were collected and the
frontal end was sliced and immersed in 2% solution of 2,3,7,triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (Sigma Inc., Louis, MO, USA)
for 30 min at 37 ◦ C. Since an infarct tissue does not stain owing
to the loss of mitochondrial enzyme activity and a normal tissue will be stained red by TTC, the infarction area that appears
white and hemisphere area of each section could be distinguished
and quantiﬁed by an image analysis system (OlympusImaging ProPlus, Silver Spring, MD, USA). The infarct volume was calculated by
dividing infarct area of the ipsilateral hemisphere by total hemisphere.
2.9. Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA in the cerebral cortices of penumbra area or
cultured cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and further puriﬁed with an RNA Micro
Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The following PCR reaction conditions were used when performed in a lightcycler PCR detection system (Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Shanghai,
China): 10 min at 95 ◦ C, 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 ◦ C, 15 s at
60 ◦ C, and 20 s at 72 ◦ C. The forward and reverse primer
sequences were as follows: 5 -GGACAGAACCAAACGTCCAG-3 and
5 -TAAGCTCAGAAGGGAATTCAGAC-3 (for ampliﬁcation of Id2),
5 -ATCACTGCCACTCAGAAG-3 and 5 -AAGTCACAGGAGACAACC-3
(for ampliﬁcation of GAPDH). The GAPDH gene was used as a reference gene, and relative mRNA expression levels were calculated
using the standard 2−Ct method.
2.10. Western blot analysis
The concentration of protein isolated from the cerebral cortices of the penumbra area or cultured cellswas determined
by a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 100 ␮g of proteins was run on 4–20% Tris–Glycine gels and transferred to
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
The transferred membrane was probed overnight at 4 ◦ C with
speciﬁc primary antibodies (anti-Id2, 1:200 dilution, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; anti-Bax, 1:1000 dilution, Cell signaling technology; anti-␤-actin, 1:50,000 dilution, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:2500 dilution, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Immunoreactive bands were
visualized with Amersham ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection

2.12. Immunoﬂuorescent staining
For double immunoﬂuorescent staining of NeuN and Id2-siRNA,
the sections were ﬁrst probed with a mouse anti-NeuN monoclonal antibody (1:50 dilution) at 37 ◦ C for 1 h, and then with
an Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution) at 37 ◦ C
for 30 min. For dual staining of Rb and Id2, the sections were
incubated with a mouse anti-Rb monoclonal antibody (1:50 dilution) and a rabbit anti-Id2 monoclonal antibody (1:50 dilution)
at 37 ◦ C for 1 h, and subsequently with an Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1000 dilution) and an Alexa Fluor 488
donkey anti-rabbit IgG at 37 ◦ C for 30 min. As for Rb and E2F1
double staining, a mouse anti-Rb monoclonal antibody (1:50 dilution) and a rabbit anti-E2F1 monoclonal antibody (1:50 dilution)
was used and followed by an Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse
IgG (1:1000 dilution) and an Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit
IgG.
After the double staining, sections were examined under a Leica
ﬂuorescence microscope (Leica, DM 5000B; Germany). The ﬂuorescently stained cells in the cerebral cortices of penumbra area were
counted from ﬁve randomized ﬁled per rat brain and expressed as
the number of stained cells per square millimeter.
2.13. Cell cycle assay
The cells in B35 group, B35-misRNA group and B35-siRNA group
were ﬁrst treated with CoCl2 for 12 h, except the cells in Naïve
control group, and then were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation. After that, the cells were ﬁxed by 70% ethanol for 48 h at
4 ◦ C, rehydrated by ice-code PBS, and stained by PI/RNase medium
containing 1 mg/ml RNase and 50 ␮g/ml propidium iodide. Cells
were then socrted by ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorter scan (FACS)
according to manufacturer’s instruction (Becton Dickinson, USA).
The percentage of cells in each cell cycle phase was analyzed by an
ELITE software (Phoenix Flow Systems, USA).
2.14. Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software
(Version 13.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Data were presented as
means ± standard deviation and the difference as analyzed by oneway ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test. A P-value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Id2 mediated hypoxia-induced apoptosis of neuronal cells
To determine whether Id2 played a role in hypoxia-induced
neuronal damage, we assessed the effect of knocking down or overexpression of Id2 in neuroblastoma B35 cells on hypoxia-induced
apoptotic cell death. Three siRNAs designed to target different
regions of Id2 mRNA were tested for their knockdown efﬁciency.

of apoptotic cells ± SD. *P < 0.001.

As shown in Fig. 1A, siRNA2 was most effective in suppressing Id2 mRNA expression as revealed by quantitative real-time
PCR analysis and therefore was chosen for all subsequent experiments. Western blot analysis showed that Id2 protein level was
also substantially reduced in the siRNA2 transfected B35 cells
(B35/siRNA-Id2) as compared to B35/misRNA, the parental B35
cells transfected with a negative control siRNA with mismatched
sequence of Id2 mRNA that showed no effect on Id2 protein expression (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C showed that the level of Id2 protein was
signiﬁcantly higher in the Id2-overexpressing B35 cells (B35/Id2)
than that in the empty vector-transfected control cells (B35/EV).
Annexin-V-FITC/PI double labeling ﬂow cytometry was then used
to measure and quantify apoptotic cell death in the cells exposed to
CoCl2 , a well-known hypoxia-mimetic agent that creates and mimics a hypoxic microenvironment [28]. As shown in Fig. 1D and 1E,
knockdown of Id2 substantially protected the B35/siRNA-Id2 cells
from CoCl2 -induced apoptosis (average apoptosis rate 19.5 ± 1.2%
versus 5.3 ± 0.5% in B35/misRNA cells, P < 0.001) whereas, overexpression of Id2 signiﬁcantly increased the apoptotic rate in
B35/Id2 cells relative to the control B35/EV cells (39.5 ± 3.5% versus
19.3 ± 1.6%, P < 0.001) following the treatment with CoCl2 . These
results indicated that Id2 might be involved importantly in one or
more pro-apoptotic mechanisms that potentiated the toxicity of
the hypoixa inducer CoCl2 .

3.2. siRNA-mediated silencing of Id2 in the brain tissues of MCAO
rats
Given the observation that Id2 appeared to modulate hypoxiainduced neuronal apoptosis in vitro, we were curious as to whether
Id2 would also have an effect on neurons suffering from ischemic
strokeas mimicked in MCAO model. To this end, in vivo knockdown
of Id2 in brain tissues was performed by injecting Cy3-labeld Id2siRNA2 into the left side of the lateral ventricle in Sprague-Dawley
rats, and siRNA incorporation at a cortical region (Fig. 2A) was analyzed at 24 h, 72 h and 120 h after the injection. As shown in Fig. 2B,
Cy3-labeled Id2-siRNA (red staining) could be detected abundantly
at the cortical region 24 h post injection and disappeared at 120 h
after injection. To identify the types of cells into which Cy3-labeled
Id2-siRNA2 was incorporated, we also stained for neuronal marker
NeuN in the same cortical region of the brain section and found
that there was a signiﬁcant co-localization between Id2-siRNA2 and
NeuN, indicating that a large portion of Id2-siRNA2 distributed in
the cortical region was within neuronal cells.
To conﬁrm effectiveness of the delivered Id2-siRNA in knocking
down Id2 expression, the cortex of penumbra area was subjected
to quantitative real-time PCR analysis and Western blot analysis
for Id2 mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 2C–E). Id2 mRNA and
protein level were found to be much lower in the siRNA group, com-

pared to other groups (P < 0.001, respectively), while no discernible
difference in Id2 mRNA and protein levels was noted among NS
group, NaCl group and misRNA group (P = 0.156).
3.3. Knockdown of Id2 increased tolerance to ischemic brain
injury
Having demonstrated that the in vivo knockdown of Id2 can
be achieved by a single intracerebroventricular injection of the
siRNA, we next investigated whether knockdown of Id2 expression
could offer neuronal protection against ischemic damage following
MCAO. As shown in Fig. 3A, based on neurological scores, application of MCAO caused a marked neurological deﬁcit in the groups
intraventricularly injected with NaCl or Id2-misRNA. In contrast,
a signiﬁcant reduction of neurological deﬁcit was observed in the
Id2-siRNA injected rats as compared to NS group or NaCl group
or misRNA group (P < 0.001, respectively). Consistent with the
improved neurological function, there was a signiﬁcant reduction
in the infarct volume in rats injected with Id2-siRNA2 compared

with NS group or NaCl group or misRNA group at 72 h post MCAO
(P < 0.001, respectively) (Fig. 3B and C). Therefore, we suggested
Id2 knockdown afforded protection on the brain tissues against
ischemic injury.
3.4. Knockdown of Id2 ameliorated neuronal apoptosis, abolished
Rb-Id2 association and enhanced Rb-E2F1 colocalization in the
penumbra area of the rats with MCAO
Following an ischemic event, apoptosis could occur in the
peripheral neurons of the penumbra area with less severe ischemia
in contrast to necrotic cell death in the central ischemic core zone
[2]. To determine whether the lesser extent of ischemic brain injury
from Id2 knockdown was also attributable to less induction of
neuronal apoptosis, we assessed the frequency of apoptotic neurons in the penumbra area by TUNEL assay at 72 h post MCAO. As
shown in Fig. 4A, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in the number of
TUNEL-positive cells in the Id2-siRNA group compared to NS group
or NaCl group or misRNA group (P < 0.001, respectively). In addi-

tion, expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax was signiﬁcantly
reduced in the neuronal cells of the penumbra area from Id2-siRNA
injected rats at 24 h or 72 h post MCAO (P < 0.001, respectively)
(Fig. 4B). These results indicated that inhibition of Id2 was able
to restrain ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis in the penumbra
area, which might salvage neurons in the penumbra from further
ischemic damage. Since a major component of the apoptotic mechanism in neurons subjected to a variety of insults involves Rb/E2F
pathway [29], we next sought to determine if Id2 was associated
with Rb and E2F1 in modulation of the neuronal apoptosis induced
by the ischemic injury. Double immunoﬂuorescence staining was
used to investigate the co-localization of Rb-Id2 and Rb-E2F1 in
neuronal cells of the penumbra area at 72 h post MCAO (Fig. 4C and
D). Quantiﬁcation of the staining revealed that the number of Rb
and Id2 double positive cells in the penumbra area of Id2-siRNA
group was signiﬁcantly less than the NaCl group (91.3 ± 7.6/mm2
versus 190.4 ± 8.6/mm2 , P < 0.001) whereas, the number of cells
positively stained with both Rb and E2F1 in the penumbra area
of siRNA group was greater than the NaCl group (220.1 ± 9.0/mm2
versus 137.3 ± 6.5/mm2 , P < 0.001). Therefore, suppression of Id2
appeared to diminish the association between Rb and Id2 but
enhance the colocalization of Rb with E2F1 in the penumbra area
of the rats with MCAO.

3.5. Knockdown of Id2 induced cell cycle arrest
We then investigated whether knockdown of Id2 had an effect
on cell cycle transition in CoCl2 -treated B35 cells. Cell cycle assay
showed that, in Naïve control group and B35-siRNA group, signiﬁcant higher number of cells was in G0/G1 stage as well as
signiﬁcantly lower number of cells in S stage, as compared to B35
group and B35-misRNA group (Fig. 5, P < 0.001). There was no signiﬁcant difference in the numbers of cells in G2/M stages among

four groups. Thus, our results demonstrated that Id2 knockdown
induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in CoCl2 -treated B35 cells.

4. Discussion
Our prior work demonstrated that hypoxia/ischemia (H/I) upregulated Id2 expression in the neuronal cells led to an increase in
the H/I induced neuronal apoptosis [22]. The results of the current
studies provided further evidence that neuronal apoptosis induced
by ischemic stroke required participation of Id2. Knockdown of Id2
attenuated neuronal apoptosis while Id2 over-expression produced
the opposite effects. Loss of Id2 signiﬁcantly improved the neurological deﬁcits, and reduced ischemic infarction as well as neuronal
apoptosis in the penumbra area of rats with MCAO. Mechanistically,
the neuronal apoptosis modulated by Id2 might involve an interaction with cell cycle regulators Rb and E2F1, and knockdown of Id2
could induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.
As RNA interference is a speciﬁc post-transcriptional regulatory
pathway that can result in gene silencing, it has become a widely
used method for gene function study and a novel therapeutic tool
to target disease genes [30]. In the central nervous system, topical injection of naked siRNA has been proved effective in silencing
genes of interest while its efﬁcacy is limited to the immediate area
surrounding the injection site [31]. Intracerebroventricular injection of siRNAs conjugated to a lipid-based reagent has been shown
promising, however, this approach raised concerns about lipidrelated toxicity and immune response [32]. In the present study,
Id2-siRNA was a new type of naked siRNA modiﬁed with cholesterol to help transport across cellular barriers and labeled with Cy3
for facilitation of incorporation study. We were able to demonstrate
that such Id2-siRNA could successfully incorporate into neuronal
cells and induce robust silencing of the targeted gene both in vitro

iﬁcation might have considerable potential as an experimental tool
for neuron-selective delivery of siRNA.
Upon Id2 knockdown we observed an improved neurological
deﬁcitin the rats with MCAO and a reduction in ischemic infarction
volume as well as a decrease of neuronal apoptosis in the penumbra area. Along with the in vitro data showing that knockdown of
Id2 mitigated hypoxia-induced neuronal apoptosis while overexpression of Id2 promoted the apoptosis, it was conceivable that
Id2 participated essentially in one or more pro-apoptotic mechanisms in neuronal cells and inhibition of it might provide a novel
therapeutic strategy to protect brain tissues from ischemic damage.
The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects afforded by Id2 knockdown in this experimental
system remained to be fully explored and elucidated. Generally,
Id proteins function in the control of differentiation and cell pro-

liferation by HLH-mediated heterodimerization with basic HLH
transcription factors [33,34]. However, non-HLH targets of Id proteins were also reported. For instance, Id2-induced apoptosis in
myeloid progenitors and osteosarcoma cells was shown independent of HLH-mediated dimerization, and the capability of Id2 in
promoting cell death relied on its N-terminal region and was related
to the increased expression of a pro-apoptotic gene, Bax [35].
In line with this, we found that knockdown of Id2 reduced the
expression of Bax protein in the affected neurons, suggesting that
Id2-induced neuronal apoptosis involved Bax protein that might
augment the apoptotic cell death. Since Id2 was known to bind to
the Rb protein [14] which is an important regulator of cell cycle
and apoptosis [16,36], and our results further demonstrated that
knockdown of Id2 could induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, we speculated that Id2-enhanced neuronal apoptosis induced by ischemia

B35 group (B), B35-misRNA group (C) and B35-siRNA group (D). The stacked vertical Bar (E) showed that, in Naïve control group and B35-siRNA group, signiﬁcant higher

might be mediated through the Rb pathway. In proliferating cells,
Rb protein functions as a checkpoint during G1/S phase transition. Rb is non-phosphorylated normally in its latent stage, and
generally believed to halt cell cycle progression through binding
to the transcription factor E2F1. In response to mitogenic stimulation, active cyclinD/CDK4/6 complexes phosphorylate Rb which
consequently releases from E2F1, leading to de-repression of E2F1
and transactivation of E2F1-targetedand apoptosis-related genes
such as p53 and Bax [29,37]. Recent studies have indicated that
Rb and other cell-cycle regulating proteins played critical roles
in neuronal apoptotic pathways in ischemia/reperfusion induced
neuronal damage [38–40]. Moreover, ischemia-induced expression
of cell cycle-associated proteins in neurons was likely to be able to
magnify their function in the apoptosis rather than in the cell cycle
itself [41,42]. In the present study, we showed that knockdown of
Id2 diminished its association with Rb but enhanced the colocalization of Rb and E2F1 in the neurons of penumbra area of the ischemic
rat brain. Since Rb is an atypical target of Id [14,43], we postulated
that suppression of Id2 might result in hypophosphorylation of Rb
in the neuronal cells and augmented E2F1-dependent proliferation
leading to less apoptotic cell death in the penumbra area. Further
studies are clearly warranted to explore possible mechanisms that
govern these processes at more molecular levels and in more depth.
However, a limitation of our present study is the exploitation
of an immortalized tumor cell line in vitro: the rat neuroblastoma
B35 cell line (ATCC, CRL-2754) to investigate H/I-induced neuronal
injury [22,23]. Despite the fact that a series of papers made use of
this cell line to simulate H/I-induced injurious effects in vitro, its distinction from primarily cultured neurons might potentially produce
biases in demonstration of biological or pathological alterations of
neural cells under H/I stress. Therefore, it would be suggested that

in the future primary neural cell culture from rats, or preferentially
humans should be considered in the study of H/I-induced neuronal
damage at the cellular level.
Another limitation of the experiment design is the absence of
interpretation of potential confounding effects of microglia and
other glia cells in response to intraventricular injection of Id2 siRNA
in vivo. Consequently, it seems that our future experiments should
take these effects into consideration through designing relevant
conﬁrmation assays of glia cell functions in order to elicit a more
credible result in the illustration of Id2 function in H/I-induced neuronal injuries. That being the case, since neuronal cells account for
the main function of the central nervous system in mammals, it
is plausible to assume that Id2-mediated neuronal function modiﬁcations carry more weight than any other type of cells either in
humans or in rats.
In summary, we found that knockdown of Id2 in neuronal cells
could protect them from hypoxic and ischemic injury both in vitro
and in vivo, which indicated the modulation of Id2 in H/I-induced
neuronal apoptosis. As Id2 silencing is feasible for clinical application (via intraventricular injection, lumbar puncture, etc) using RNA
interference, it might also provide a potential therapeutic option to
protect brain tissues from ischemic injury.
