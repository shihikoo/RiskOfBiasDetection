Astrocytes limit inflammation after CNS injury, at least partially by physically containing it within an astrocytic scar at the injury
border. We report here that astrocytic transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb) signaling is a second, distinct mechanism that
astrocytes utilize to limit neuroinflammation. TGFbs are anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective cytokines that are upregulated
subacutely after stroke, during a clinically accessible time window. We have previously demonstrated that TGFbs signal to
astrocytes, neurons and microglia in the stroke border days after stroke. To investigate whether TGFb affects astrocyte immunoregulatory functions, we engineered “Ast-Tbr2DN” mice where TGFb signaling is inhibited specifically in astrocytes.
Despite having a similar infarct size to wildtype controls, Ast-Tbr2DN mice exhibited significantly more neuroinflammation
during the subacute period after distal middle cerebral occlusion (dMCAO) stroke. The peri-infarct cortex of Ast-Tbr2DN
mice contained over 60% more activated CD11b1 monocytic cells and twice as much immunostaining for the activated microglia and macrophage marker CD68 than controls. Astrocytic scarring was not altered in Ast-Tbr2DN mice. However, AstTbr2DN mice were unable to upregulate TGF-b1 and its activator thrombospondin-1 2 days after dMCAO. As a result, the
normal upregulation of peri-infarct TGFb signaling was blunted in Ast-Tbr2DN mice. In this setting of lower TGFb signaling
and excessive neuroinflammation, we observed worse motor outcomes and late infarct expansion after photothrombotic
motor cortex stroke. Taken together, these data demonstrate that TGFb signaling is a molecular mechanism by which astrocytes limit neuroinflammation, activate TGFb in the peri-infarct cortex and preserve brain function during the subacute period
after stroke.

Introduction

A

strocytes are uniquely positioned to regulate inflammatory responses after CNS injury. They become activated
during the subacute period after injury that is characterized
by neuroinflammation (Barreto et al., 2011; Chen and Swanson, 2003) and respond to injury in a highly localized manner. Previous research in our laboratory demonstrated that
after stroke astrocytes in the peri-infarct cortex respond to the
major regulatory cytokine transforming growth factor-beta
(TGFb), as measured by nuclear localization of its downstream mediator phosphorylated Smad2 (pSmad2) in glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing astrocytes (Doyle
et al., 2010; Massague and Wotton, 2000). However, the

functions of astrocytic TGFb signaling during the subacute
period after stroke remain to be discovered.
Astrocytes react to injury by increasing GFAP expression. GFAP1 astrocytes eventually form a physical barrier,
also known as the astrocytic scar, which limits immune cell
infiltration and protects adjacent uninjured tissue (Schachtrup
et al., 2010; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010). This process of
astrocytic scar formation requires astrocytic STAT3 and
GFAP (Li et al., 2008; Wanner et al., 2013).
In addition to forming a scar, astrocytes respond to CNS
injury by producing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
For example, astrocytes produce the chemokines CCL2, CXCL1
and CXCL2 after ischemia or spinal cord injury (Pineau et al.,

2010; Zamanian et al., 2012), and CCL2 and CCL5 after traumatic brain injury (Babcock et al., 2003; Glabinski et al., 1996).
These pro-inflammatory chemokines may be beneficial by attracting immune cells, which have been shown to reduce tissue damage
by clearing dead cells (Dheen et al., 2007; Iadecola and Anrather,
2011). In contrast, excessive inflammation can be harmful by
inducing free-radical damage to neurons (Brown, 2010) and
increasing cerebral edema, which can cause brain herniation and
further tissue damage (Heiss, 2012). Therefore, it is essential to
limit neuroinflammation during the subacute period after injury
in order to reduce neuronal damage.
We hypothesized that the activation of astrocytic TGFb
signaling that we observed in the subacute period after stroke
might represent an active anti-inflammatory function of astrocytes. The TGFb isoform TGF-b1 is upregulated by the
majority of brain injuries (Finch et al., 1993) and signals to
all cell types in the injured brain (Buckwalter and WyssCoray, 2004; Pratt and McPherson, 1997). It is specifically
increased during the subacute period that coincides with neuroinflammation after stroke (Yamashita et al., 1999). TGFbs
have anti-inflammatory functions in the immune system
(Crowe et al., 2000; Fadok et al., 1998) and are acutely neuroprotective at the time of stroke (Pang et al., 2001; Ruocco
et al., 1999). However, TGFb functions in astrocytes during
the subacute period after stroke are not known.
To investigate how endogenous TGFb signaling regulates
astrocyte function after stroke in vivo, we engineered a transgenic mouse model to inhibit TGFb signaling in GFAP1
astrocytes during the subacute period after stroke by expressing
a mutant receptor that is unable to initiate downstream signaling when bound by either TGFb isoform (Frugier et al., 2005;
Shi and Massague, 2003). Temporal specificity was achieved
using a GFAP promoter that is upregulated in the peri-infarct
cortex during this time. We demonstrate that inhibiting astrocytic TGFb signaling resulted in excessive immune cell infiltration and activation 2–3 days after stroke. This increase in
neuroinflammation was not associated with changes in infarct
size, or in astrocytic GFAP upregulation and scar formation.
However, inhibiting TGFb signaling abolished the normal
upregulation of TGF-b1 and its activator thrombospondin-1,
and blunted TGFb pathway activation in the peri-infarct cortex. Finally, inhibiting astrocytic TGFb signaling was also associated with worse motor outcomes. We conclude that TGFb
signaling is critical for astrocytic control of neuroinflammation
and preserving function in the peri-infarct cortex during the
subacute period after stroke.

Materials and Methods
Mice
All use of animals was conducted according to protocols approved by
the Stanford Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the

1228

NIH Guide for Care and Use of Animals. Ast-Tbr2DN transgenic
mice were a cross between the lines B6.FVB-Tg(tetO-EGFP,Tgfbr2)8Mcle/J (JAX #005738) and B6.Cg-Tg(GFAP-tTA)110Pop/J
(JAX #005964), both obtained from Jackson Labs. The first line (Frugier et al., 2005; Lin and Yang, 2013; Rani et al., 2011) carries a bitetO promoter that drives the expression of two genes: a dominant
negative mutant Type II TGFb receptor, which has a truncated intracellular domain and prevents all TGFb signaling (Shi and Massague,
2003), and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Thus, eGFP
expressing cells are also expected to express high levels of the mutant
receptor. The second transgenic line expresses GFAP-tTA, which
directs bi-tetO promoter-mediated expression to GFAP1 astrocytes
(Florian et al., 2011; Halassa et al., 2009; Pascual et al., 2005). Similar to the native GFAP promoter, the GFAP promoter in GFAP-tTA
mice strongly increases transgene expression after injury (Brenner
et al., 1994). All experiments were done using 2-month-old females.
Singly transgenic B6.FVB-Tg(tetO-EGFP,-Tgfbr2)8Mcle/J mice were
used as wildtype littermate controls.

Surgery
Distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) strokes were
induced as previously described (Doyle et al., 2010). For photothrombotic stroke, the skull was cleaned of connective tissue and
lightly shaved using a sterile razor blade. The Dolan-Jenner MH-100
Metal Halide Fiber Optic Illuminator (Edmundoptics, #56371) light
source with a 5-mm diameter optic cable (Edmundoptics, #39365)
was placed on top of the skull and 403 microscope objective was
used to focus the light. The light was turned on twice for 15 min,
beginning 5 min after a 40 mg kg21 Rose Bengal (Sigma, #3300005G) injection (10 mg mL21 in sterile saline, administered intraperitoneally), to form two overlapping circular lesions in the right motor
cortex. Body temperature was maintained at 37 C, and immediately
following surgery mice received 10 mg kg21 of Cefazolin (VWR,
#89149-888) and 0.1 mg kg21 of Buprenorphine (Henry Schein,
#6030894) for infection prophylaxis and pain management.

Flow Cytometry
We homogenized the stroked hemisphere and collected a monocyteenriched population of cells using a Percoll gradient (Arac et al.,
2011). The cells were stained with the following markers and antibodies: AquaAmine Live/Dead stain (Invitrogen, #L34957) CD11bPE (eBioscience, #12–0112-82) and CD45-APC (eBioscience, #17–
0451-82), counted on the FACSAria III cell sorter (BD Biosciences)
and analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar).

Perfusion and Brain Processing for
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were sedated with 3.8% chloral hydrate and terminally perfused with 0.9% NaCl containing 10 U mL21 heparin. Brains were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer for 24 h, rinsed
with PBS, and then sunk in 30% sucrose in PBS. Coronal brain sections 40-lm thick were cut using a freezing sliding microtome
(Microm HM430) into 24 sequential tubes, so that each tube contained every 24th section spaced 960-lm apart, and were stored in
cryoprotective medium at 220 C.

Immunohistochemistry
We analyzed images with MetaMorph and ImageJ software. We evaluated GFAP colocalization with eGFP and with pSmad2 in four coronal sections per mouse, evenly spaced 480-lm apart. To avoid bias,
co-localization of pSmad2 with GFAP was scored first, and eGFP
expression was examined afterwards. We quantified CD68 immunostaining in the peri-infarct cortex in five sections per mouse at 2.53
magnification, evenly spaced 960-lm apart. We quantified GFAP
immunostaining in the peri-infarct cortex in two sections per mouse
at 2.53 magnification, 960-lm apart. We counted MHCII1 cells in
three sections per mouse 960-lm apart.

Infarct Size Evaluation
Infarct size was quantified using an immunostain with an anti-NeuN
antibody that marks neuronal nuclei, counterstained with cresyl violet, which marks all cell nuclei. The infarct was traced on six sections
per mouse, 480-lm apart, and expressed as % of the ipsilateral
hemisphere after dMCAO (Woo et al., 2012) or as volume after
photothrombotic stroke (Clarkson et al. 2011).

Antibodies
We used the following primary antibodies for immunohistochemistry: anti-phosphorylated Smad2 (rabbit, 1:1000, Millipore,
#AB3849), anti-GFAP (rabbit, 1:1000, DAKO, #Z0334), biotinylated anti-GFAP (mouse, 1:200, Abcam, #ab79203), anti-eGFP
(chicken, 1:200, Millipore, #AB16901), biotinylated anti-NeuN

#553621), anti-NG2 (rabbit, 1:500, Millipore, #AB5320), and antiphosphoAkt (rabbit, 1:1000, Abcam, #ab81283).
We used the following secondary antibodies for immunohistochemistry: AlexaFluor-488 donkey anti-chicken (Jackson Immunoresearch, #703-096-155), AlexaFluor-555 streptavidin (Invitrogen/
Molecular Probes, #S-32355), AlexaFluor-555 donkey anti-rabbit

(Invitrogen, #A-31573), AlexaFluor-647 streptavidin (Invitrogen/
Molecular Probes, #S-21374), and biotinylated rabbit anti-rat (Vector Laboratories, #BA-4001).
We used the following antibodies for Western blots: phosphorylated Smad2 (rabbit, 1:200, Millipore, #AB3849), Smad2 (rabbit,
1:200, Cell Signaling, #3122), phosphorylated Akt (mouse, 1:200,
Cell Signaling, #4051), Akt (rabbit, 1:200, Cell Signaling, #9272),
actin (rabbit, 1:20,000, Sigma, #A5060), goat anti-rabbit HRP
(1:20,000, Santa Cruz, #sc-2004) and goat anti-mouse HRP
(1:20,000, DAKO, #P0447). Actin was used as a loading control.
All secondary antibodies were used at 1:200 dilution.

Sample Preparation for Protein and mRNA
Measurements
After perfusion, we dissected tissue samples from the peri-infarct cortex and the contralateral cortex directly opposite the stroke core, as
well as from cortex and striatum in sham mice. The peri-infarct cortex was defined as the cortical area within 2.5-mm radius from the
stroke core at the time of tissue extraction.

August 2014

For protein assays, tissue was flash frozen and kept at 280 C
until homogenization in cell lysis buffer with Complete Mini protease
inhibitor (Roche, #11836153001) and 0.1% Na3VO4. Samples were
sonicated for 10 s, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was equalized using a BCA Pierce
protein assay kit (ThermoScientific, #23227). Four to six animals per
group were used for all protein assays. For Western blots, tissue lysates
were mixed with 20% dithiothreitol in 43 NuPage LDS loading buffer
(Invitrogen, #NP0007). Samples were loaded onto 4–12% NuPage BisTris gels (Invitrogen, #NP0335) and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Amersham, #RPN303F).

Multiplex Luminex Assay and ELISA
Multiplex luminex assay was performed by the Human Immune
Monitoring Center at Stanford University (himc.stanford.edu). Each
sample was measured in duplicate. Plates were read using a Luminex
200 instrument with a lower bound of 100 beads per sample per
cytokine. Results were analyzed using Cluster 3.0 and visualized
using JavaTreeView software. TGF-b1 protein concentration was
measured using a Mouse/Rat/Porcine/Canine TGF-b1 Quantikine
ELISA kit (R&D Systems, #MB100B). To activate latent TGF-b1,
protein samples were activated by 1M HCl and quenched by 1M
NaOH, following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Quantitative RT-PCR
We isolated mRNA and performed qPCR as previously described (Shi
et al., 2010). We quantified the expression of the following genes:
thrombospondin-1 (Thbs1-001, RefSeq mRNA: NM_011580.3, forward primer: 50 -GCAAAGACTGTGTTGGCGATGTGA-30 , reverse
primer: 50 -ACTCATCGACGTCTTTGCACTGGA-30 ), iNOS (Nos2,
RefSeq mRNA: NM_010927.3, forward primer: 50 -TGACGGCAAA
CATGACTTCAG-30 , reverse primer: 50 -GCCATCGGGCATCTGG

primer: 50 -AGGCAATGGACGCATCAC-30 , reverse primer: 50 -TTC
CTCGGTTGTCCTTCTTG-30 ), and tenascin-C (Tnc, RefSeq
mRNA: NM_011607.3, forward primer: 50 -GCAACCAAGGACAAT
GTGTG-30 , reverse primer: 50 -TGTGGTTTCAGACACCCGTA-30 ).
We used GAPDH as a control (Gapdh-001, RefSeq mRNA:
NM_008084.2, forward primer: 50 -TGCACCACCAACTGCTTA
G-30 , reverse primer: 50 -GATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-30 ).

Behavioral Scores
For the beam balance test (Manaenko et al., 2011) we used the following
scoring system: 5—mice move across the beam to their home cage in 6 s,
4—mice move to their home cage in 11 s or within 6 s but do not get into
the cage, 3—mice move more than half the distance to their home cage
within 11 s and stay on the beam for at least 6 s, 2—mice do not move
more than half the distance to their home cage within 11 s and stay on the
beam for at least 6 s, 1—mice do not move, but stay on the beam for 11 s,
0—mice fall off the beam within 11 s.
The Modified Garcia Score is a well-established sensorimotor
assessment system consisting of seven individual tests, of which we
used the 5 that measure motor function (Doyle et al., 2012; Garcia
et al., 1995). We scored each test from 0 to 3 (maximal score 5 15):
(1) climbing, (2) forelimb walking, (3) forelimb strength, (4) lateral
turning, and (5) limb symmetry as described (Doyle et al., 2012).

Statistical Analysis
All experimental data were acquired in a blinded and unbiased fashion. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6 software
(GraphPad). Means between two groups were compared using twotailed, unpaired Student’s t test for parametric data, and Mann–
Whitney test for nonparametric data. Means between more than two
groups were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Comparisons of means from two
genotypes at multiple timepoints were performed using two-way
ANOVA when mouse cohorts were different at each timepoint, and
repeated measures ANOVA when the same mice were used throughout the course of the experiment. For cluster analysis, cytokine
detection in 80% of samples was used as a threshold, and the difference between clusters was computed based on Pearson’s correlation.

Results
Construction of an “Ast-Tbr2DN” Mouse Model to
Inhibit Astrocytic TGFb Signaling
To investigate astrocytic TGFb signaling after stroke, we selected
the model of distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO)
1230

(Colak et al., 2011). The advantages of dMCAO are that it is
directly caused by arterial occlusion and produces a highly consistent stroke with a clearly defined border. We previously reported
that TGFb signaling increases in GFAP1 astrocytes in the periinfarct cortex during the first week after dMCAO, as represented
by nuclear localization of pSmad2 (Doyle et al., 2010) (Fig. 1A).
To study the function of endogenous astrocytic TGFb
signaling after stroke, we engineered a dominant negative
(Ast-Tbr2DN) transgenic mouse model that inhibits TGFb
signaling specifically in GFAP1 astrocytes (Fig. 1B). Adult
Ast-Tbr2DN mice were indistinguishable from wildtypes
prior to stroke based on gross anatomy, expression of GFAP,
immune cell markers and cytokines, and motor function
(data not shown). We verified that stroke upregulates the
transgene specifically in GFAP1 astrocytes by coimmunostaining for GFAP and the transgene marker eGFP. We observed
that eGFP expression was present at baseline in 10% of
astrocytes. As expected, transgene expression significantly
increased after dMCAO in the peri-infarct cortex (Fig. 1C).

eGFP expression was completely specific to astrocytes at all
timepoints and did not co-localize with any other cell types
(Fig. 1D and data not shown).
To verify that the mutant TGFb receptor was functional
in reducing TGFb signaling in eGFP1 astrocytes in AstTbr2DN mice, we immunostained for the downstream
TGFb signaling marker nuclear pSmad2 and quantified its
colocalization with GFAP and with eGFP in the peri-infarct
cortex. To avoid bias, we scored the colocalization of pSmad2
and GFAP prior to examining eGFP. Significantly fewer
GFAP1/eGFP1 astrocytes in Ast-Tbr2DN mice co-localized
August 2014

with nuclear pSmad2 when compared with astrocytes in wildtype mice (Fig. 1E,F). By contrast, GFAP1/eGFP2 astrocytes
in Ast-Tbr2DN mice showed the same proportion of nuclear
pSmad2 as astrocytes in wildtype mice (Fig. 1F). Thus, in
Ast-Tbr2DN mice the mutant type II TGFb receptor blocks
TGFb signaling in GFAP1/eGFP1 astrocytes.

Magnitude and Spread of Inflammation in the
Peri-Infarct Cortex

days after stroke the immune response consists predominantly
of activated monocytic cells, both CNS microglia and peripheral macrophages (Denker et al., 2007; Iadecola and Anrather,
2011; Stevens et al., 2002). We used FACS to count activated
microglia and macrophages in the stroked hemisphere of AstTbr2DN mice and wildtype controls (Fig. 2A,B). CD11b1
cells with medium CD45 expression were classified as activated CNS microglia, and CD11b1 cells with high CD45
expression as peripheral macrophages (Mizutani et al., 2012).
The stroked hemisphere of Ast-Tbr2DN mice contained significantly (67%) more cells in combined microglial and macrophage populations, with a particularly pronounced 110%
increase in macrophages (Fig. 2B).
To assess whether inhibiting astrocytic TGFb signaling
affected the localization as well as the magnitude of the
immune cell infiltration, we immunostained for CD68, which
is a marker for activated microglia and macrophages. CD681
cells with activated amoeboid morphology were present in the
peri-infarct cortex in both genotypes. We quantified the percentage of cortical area that was covered by CD68 immunostaining in a series of sections spanning the entire stroke
region. In keeping with the flow cytometry results, the area
covered by CD681 cells was 1.9-fold larger in Ast-Tbr2DN
peri-infarct cortex as in wildtype controls (Fig. 2C,D).
To verify this increased spread of activated monocytic
lineage cells, and to examine their activation state, we examined immunostaining for major histocompatibility complex
class II (MHC II). MHC II regulates antigen presentation
and is used as a marker for proinflammatory microglia and
1232

macrophages (Mantovani et al., 2004). As with the activated
microglia and macrophage cell counts, and the CD68 immunostaining, we observed almost twice as many MHC II1 cells
in the peri-infarct cortex of Ast-Tbr2DN mice as in wildtype
controls (Fig. 2E,F). Furthermore, MHC II1 cells, like
CD681 cells, appeared to be disseminated further from the
infarct in Ast-Tbr2DN mice.
Activated microglia and macrophages also express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Kigerl et al., 2009; Mantovani et al., 2004) which leads to free radical formation and
increases neuronal damage (Brown, 2010). To assess whether
inhibiting astrocytic TGFb signaling increases iNOS expression after stroke, we used qPCR to measure iNOS mRNA
levels in the peri-infarct cortex of Ast-Tbr2DN and wildtype
mice (Fig. 2G). We observed twofold more iNOS mRNA in
Ast-Tbr2DN than wildtype mice after stroke, which approximately correlates with the increased number of activated
microglia and peripheral macrophages (Fig. 2B,D,F). These
findings indicate that inhibiting astrocytic TGFb signaling
increases the magnitude and the extent of inflammation in
the peri-infarct cortex as well as its potential neurotoxicity via
iNOS production.
Inhibiting Astrocytic TGFb Signaling Does Not
Affect Initial Stroke Size or Astrocytic Activation in
the Peri-Infarct Cortex
One possible reason for a larger immune response in AstTbr2DN mice could be a larger stroke. However, at this
timepoint, 2 days after stroke, when we observed increased

A second possibility that could explain more immune
cells in the brain after stroke might be an inadequate physical
astrocytic barrier (Voskuhl et al., 2009; Wanner et al., 2013).
However, we did not observe any morphological differences
in GFAP1 astrocytes between genotypes, including in the
peri-infarct cortex. Furthermore, there were no genotypedependent differences in % area covered by GFAP immunostaining in the peri-infarct cortex 3 days after stroke
August 2014

(Fig. 3B,C). Finally, we did not observe any differences
between genotypes in GFAP immunostaining even after the
immune response largely subsided, 7 days after stroke (wildtype: 12.59% 6 1.44%, Ast-Tbr2DN: 15.13% 6 2.23%,
P 5 0.37).
To perform a more thorough evaluation of early astrocyte activation and barrier formation, we also measured two
extracellular matrix proteins that are upregulated in astrocytes
during the subacute period after CNS injury (Schachtrup
et al., 2010; Smith and Hale, 1997; Zamanian et al., 2012):
1233

fibronectin-1 and tenascin C. As with GFAP, there was no
difference in expression of either gene in Ast-Tbr2DN mice
compared with wildtype controls (Fig. 3D,E). Thus, our
results suggest astrocytic TGFb signaling during the subacute
period after stroke did not alter neuroinflammation by altering the astrocytic scar.
Astrocytic TGFb Signaling is Required to
Upregulate the Expression of TGF-b1 and its
Activator Thrombospondin-1 in the Peri-Infarct
Cortex during the Subacute Period after Stroke
Because astrocytes respond to CNS injury by producing cytokines and chemokines, we next investigated whether inhibiting astrocytic TGFb signaling could increase inflammation
by altering the cytokine milieu in the peri-infarct cortex. We
measured a panel of 26 distinct pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines and chemokines in the peri-infarct and contralateral
cortex 2 days after stroke using a multiplex luminex assay.
Three of these cytokines (IL-3, IL-10, and GCSF) were undetectable in the peri-infarct cortex.
Unbiased cluster analysis of the remaining 23 proteins
revealed distinct patterns of expression based on genotype
(Fig. 4A). However, TGF-b1 itself was the only cytokine
that, on an individual basis, showed significant genotypedependent differences, and thus it was the main factor that
influenced sample clustering. There was a threefold reduction
in TGF-b1 in the Ast-Tbr2DN peri-infarct cortex compared
with wildtype (Fig. 4B), suggesting that inhibiting astrocytic
TGFb signaling disrupts a feed-forward mechanism by which
TGFb signaling in astrocytes normally propagates its own
upregulation after stroke. We confirmed by ELISA that AstTbr2DN mice have normal levels of TGF-b1 before stroke,
but then fail to upregulate it normally in the peri-infarct cortex (Fig. 4C).
Of the 3 TGFb isoforms, TGF-b1 is the one most
upregulated by injury, including stroke in both animal models and human patients (Dhandapani and Brann, 2003;
Finch et al., 1993; Krupinski et al., 1996), though TGF-b2
can also be increased by stroke (Vivien and Ali, 2006). To
investigate whether TGFb mRNA is upregulated by
dMCAO, and whether astrocytic TGFb signaling reduces its
expression at an mRNA level as well as protein level, we
quantified the expression of TGF-b1, 2 and 3 mRNA by
qPCR. We found that both TGF-b1 and TGF-b2, but not
TGF-b3 in wildtype mice are significantly increased by 2
days after dMCAO (TGF-b1: 3.55 6 0.70-fold, *P 5 0.011;
TGF-b2: 2.24 6 0.26-fold, **P 5 0.0028; TGF-b3: 0.92 6
0.15-fold, P 5 0.82, Student’s t test). However, we did not
observe any differences between Ast-Tbr2DN mice and
wildtype controls in either TGF-b1 or TGF-b2 mRNA
expression (data not shown). In addition, TGF-b1 was the
1234

isoform that was most highly expressed after stroke, as its
mRNA was expressed at 95.01 6 1.22-fold higher level than
TGF-b2 mRNA. Thus, astrocytic TGFb signaling is
required to induce TGF-b1 production primarily at the protein rather than the mRNA level.
After secretion TGF-b1 is stored in an inactive form in
a latent complex that is bound to the extracellular matrix.
This latent store of TGF-b1 requires activation in order to
initiate TGFb signaling (Annes et al., 2003). One major
TGFb activator is thrombospondin-1, which initiates
protease-mediated cleavage of TGFb from the latent complex
and serves as the main TGFb activator in vivo (Crawford
et al., 1998). In addition, TGF-b1 is known to stimulate the
production of thrombospondin-1 by astrocytes (Cambier
et al., 2005; Yonezawa et al., 2010). Therefore, we investigated thrombospondin-1 as a potential astrocytic TGFbsignaling dependent activator of TGF-b1 in the peri-infarct
cortex.
We found that Ast-Tbr2DN mice fail to upregulate
thrombospondin-1 mRNA 2 days after stroke, while wildtype
mice upregulate it fivefold (Fig. 4D). This finding suggests
that after stroke astrocytic TGFb signaling participates in a
positive feedback loop where it is required to upregulate both
TGF-b1 and also its activator thrombospondin-1. There is
one other TGFb activator that is produced by astrocytes,
integrin b8 (Cambier et al., 2005; Mu et al., 2002). However, we observed no significant difference in integrin b8
mRNA between Ast-Tbr2DN mice and wildtype controls 2
days after stroke (wildtype: 1.04 6 0.155, Ast-Tbr2DN:
1.02 6 0.148).

Ast-Tbr2DN Mice Exhibit a Global Reduction in
TGFb Signaling after Stroke
TGFb signaling is upregulated subacutely in peri-infarct cortex in wildtype mice (Doyle et al., 2010). To evaluate
whether the relative deficiency of TGF-b1 and
thrombospondin-1 in Ast-Tbr2DN mice caused an overall
reduction in downstream TGFb signaling in the peri-infarct
cortex, we examined Smad2 phosphorylation by Western
blot. As with TGF-b1 protein levels, there was no difference
before stroke (Fig. 5A,B). However, 2 days after stroke,
Smad2 phosphorylation was significantly reduced in the AstTbr2DN peri-infarct cortex (Fig. 5C,D), consistent with a
decrease in TGF-b1 and its activator thrombospondin-1. By
7 days after stroke, thrombospondin-1 mRNA in AstTbr2DN mice reached wildtype levels (normalized WT:
1.00 6 0.23, Ast-Tbr2DN: 1.36 6 0.27, P 5 0.35). At this
later timepoint, Smad2 phosphorylation also returned to
normal (normalized WT: 1.00 6 0.05, Ast-Tbr2DN:
0.87 6 0.09, P 5 0.25). Thus, the primary effect of astrocytic

TGFb signaling on these parameters was on the subacute
upregulation of TGFb signaling after stroke.
To assess whether this overall decrease in subacute
TGFb signaling meant that there was a global effect throughout the peri-infarct region (i.e., an effect on TGFb pathway
activation in non-astrocyte cell types), we examined Akt pathway activation in neurons. We selected Akt phosphorylation
because it is neuroprotective after ischemia and a neuronal
target of TGFb signaling after stroke (Zhao et al., 2006; Zhu
et al., 2004). Indeed, Western blots for phosphorylated and
total Akt indicated an overall decrease in Akt phosphorylation

primarily, although not exclusively, neuronal. It colocalized
with the neuronal nuclear marker NeuN, and its immunostaining was decreased throughout the peri-infarct cortex in
Ast-Tbr2DN mice (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, when we quantified the percent of neurons that exhibited any nuclear pAkt
immunostaining, there were significantly fewer pAkt1/
NeuN1 nuclei in Ast-Tbr2DN mice than in WT mice (Fig.

stroke in Ast-Tbr2DN mice causes decreased TGFb signaling
in neurons as well as in astrocytes.
Inhibiting Astrocytic TGFb Signaling Worsens Motor
Outcomes during the First Week after Stroke
The dMCAO stroke model does not produce motor deficits,
so to investigate whether increased inflammation and neuronal damage in Ast-Tbr2DN mice is physiologically important
for motor recovery, we targeted the motor cortex using the
photothrombotic stroke model. As with dMCAO, there was
no difference in infarct sizes early after stroke (Fig. 6A).
However, by 4 weeks we observed 1.5-fold larger strokes in
Ast-Tbr2DN mice than in wildtype controls (Fig. 6B).
To test motor outcomes, we subjected Ast-Tbr2DN
mice and wildtype controls to the beam balance test as well
as to a battery of motor tests, which are collectively known as
the modified Garcia test, weekly for 4 weeks following photothrombotic stroke. Neither wildtype nor Ast-Tbr2DN mice
showed any behavioral impairment at baseline.
In the beam balance test, Ast-Tbr2DN mice performed
significantly worse during the first week after stroke
1236

(Fig. 6C), though both genotypes achieved full recovery by 4
weeks. By comparison, neither genotype demonstrated full
motor recovery in the modified Garcia test by 4 weeks after
stroke. In this test Ast-Tbr2DN mice exhibited a larger motor
deficit within the first week after stroke that persisted
throughout the testing (Fig. 6D–H). This deficit in AstTbr2DN mice appeared as a trend in subtests of limb symmetry, forelimb strength and lateral turning (Fig. 6D–F) and
was highly significant in forelimb walking and climbing
(Fig. 6G,H). Overall, the combined motor test score indicated significantly worse motor outcomes in Ast-Tbr2DN
mice (Fig. 6I). Together, these results show that astrocytic
TGFb signaling limits both infarct expansion and the severity
of motor deficits.

Discussion
We demonstrate here that astrocytic TGFb signaling functions to limit immune cell infiltration and activation after
stroke. Interestingly, the immunoregulatory effects of astrocytic TGFb signaling are a distinct mechanism, independent

of the physical barrier formed by astrocytes: we observed no
differences in the expression of GFAP and ECM components
between mice with normal and reduced astrocytic TGFb signaling. Instead, our results are consistent with a model in
which TGFb signaling in astrocytes upregulates beneficial
TGFb signaling in the peri-infarct cortex during the subacute
time window after stroke by upregulating the expression of
TGF-b1 and its activator thrombospondin-1 (Fig. 7). This
positive feedback loop then limits neuroinflammation and
neuronal injury in the peri-infarct cortex via the immunosuppressive and neuroprotective functions of TGFb.
We found that astrocytic TGFb signaling limits the
magnitude and spread of the immune response to stroke, but
found no evidence that it affected immune cell polarization.
Ast-Tbr2DN mice with reduced astrocytic TGFb signaling
exhibited a twofold increase in the number of activated
microglia and macrophages 2 days after stroke. We next
quantified two markers of proinflammatory macrophages and
microglia, MHC II and iNOS, and observed a corresponding
twofold upregulation, consistent with twice as many cells
rather than a change in immune cell phenotype. In addition,
since Ast-Tbr2DN and wildtype stroke volumes were not significantly different at this time point, this excessive neuroinflammation was not caused by a difference in stroke size.
Excessive neuroinflammation in Ast-Tbr2DN mice was
however associated with increased neuronal dysfunction and
injury, represented by impaired motor recovery and late
infarct expansion in the photothrombotic stroke model. The
photothrombotic stroke model was used not only to measure
motor outcomes but also to increase accuracy in measuring
late infarct size because it produces a much larger stroke than
the dMCAO model. In contrast, dMCAO in C57BL/6J mice
does not produce a motor deficit, and the infarct cannot be
easily measured by 4 weeks after stroke due to cortical atrophy. However, neither dMCAO nor photothrombotic stroke
sizes were different between genotypes 1 day after infarction,
before the peak immune response.
August 2014

Neuronal dysfunction in Ast-Tbr2DN mice may have
occurred secondary to the twofold increase in iNOS, which is
known to be neurotoxic by stimulating free radical production (Brown, 2010). In addition, both TGFb and TGFb
pathway activation were also significantly lower in AstTbr2DN peri-infarct cortex 2 days after stroke. TGFb is well
known to be directly anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective following stroke (Pang et al., 2001; Ruocco et al., 1999), in part
by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway that leads to Akt phosphorylation in neurons (Zhu et al., 2002, 2004). Indeed, we
did observe a lower probability of nuclear pAkt immunostaining in Ast-Tbr2DN mouse neurons after stroke and an overall reduction in pAkt in peri-infarct cortex. Thus, when
TGFb signaling is normally upregulated in wildtype mice in
the subacute period after stroke it may provide neuroprotection against secondary injury in the peri-infarct cortex. However, it is important to note that TGFb signaling involves
multiple pathways in addition to the classic canonical pathways mediated by Smads. The Akt pathway is only one of
the noncanonical signaling pathways activated by TGFb.
Other noncanonical pathways that it activates, such as MAPK
and Erk mediated signaling (Zhang, 2009), could also potentially affect TGFb-induced neuroprotection after stroke.
This study is, to our knowledge, the first time that an
astrocytic signaling pathway has been shown to limit neuroinflammation without affecting the physical barrier formed by
astrocytes. Either ablating proliferating GFAP1 astrocytes or
deleting the inflammatory mediator STAT3 in astrocytes
reduces the physical barrier and increases immune cell infiltration after traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries (Bush
et al., 1999; Wanner et al., 2013). Similarly, expressing a
dominant negative inhibitor of proinflammatory NF-jB signaling both increases astrocytic scarring and reduces the
expression of proinflammatory cytokines after spinal cord
injury and ischemia (Brambilla et al., 2005; Dvoriantchikova
et al., 2009). In contrast, here we found that when astrocytic
TGFb signaling is inhibited, there is more immune cell infiltration without changes in the expression of GFAP or two
other components of the physical barrier, tenascin-C, and
fibronectin.
Although inhibiting astrocytic TGFb signaling did not
change the physical barrier formed by astrocytes, we did
observe that it significantly altered cytokine expression in the
peri-infarct cortex. Astrocytes with reduced TGFb signaling
were unable to stimulate the expression of the injuryresponsive TGFb isoform TGF-b1 and its activator
thrombospondin-1 in the subacute time window after stroke.
Interestingly, thrombospondin-1 has not previously been
implicated in TGFb activation after stroke. While our findings cannot exclude the existence of other TGFb activating
molecules that are affected by astrocytic TGFb-signaling after
1237

stroke, thrombospondin-1 is known to be a major activator
of TGFb in vivo (Crawford et al., 1998), and TGFb is
known to induce thrombospondin-1 transcription in astrocytes (Ikeda et al., 2010).
Thus, our results indicate that instead of altering the
physical barrier formed by astrocytes, TGFb signaling affects
what the astrocytes secrete. We therefore speculate that in
addition to their ability to generate a physical barrier, astrocytes form a “secretory” barrier to injury, composed at least
in part by molecules such as TGFb that astrocytes secrete to
limit neuroinflammation.
Our results further reveal that normal astrocytic TGFb
signaling regulates this secretory barrier in a time and
location-specific manner: inhibiting astrocytic TGFb signaling
primarily affected the levels of active TGFb during the subacute time period and in the peri-infarct cortex. This subacute
time window was also the critical time period in which
TGFb signaling in GFAP1 astrocytes was required to limit
inflammation. By comparison, inhibiting astrocytic TGFb
signaling had no effect on inflammatory cells or cytokines,
astrocyte activation, or motor performance at baseline. Similarly, we did not observe any differences between genotypes
on or after 7 days after stroke either in neuroinflammation or
in worsening of the behavioral deficit. Thrombospondin-1
expression also returned to wildtype levels by 7 days, potentially because sufficient thrombospondin-1 was produced by
activated microglia and macrophages (Lanz et al., 2010;
Ortiz-Masia et al., 2012). This temporal specificity suggests a
clinically relevant time window to target astrocytic TGFb signaling for maximal benefit.
In the context of previous studies on global differences
in TGFb levels after injury, it was surprising that decreased
astrocytic TGFb signaling did not reduce GFAP expression
and alter the astrocytic scar after stroke. TGF-b1 directly
stimulates astrocytic expression of GFAP (Reilly et al., 1998;
Romao et al., 2008) as well as the ECM components fibronectin and tenascin-C (Schachtrup et al., 2010; Smith and
Hale, 1997). In addition, mice that overexpress mutant, constitutively active TGF-b1 in the hippocampus have increased
GFAP expression (Wyss-Coray et al., 1997), while global
depletion of TGFb reduces GFAP expression after traumatic
brain injury (Logan et al., 1994; Yoshioka et al., 2011). By
contrast, we show that inhibiting endogenous astrocytic
TGFb signaling and global TGFb upregulation did not affect
the expression of these physical barrier components. This
incongruity could be caused by differences in TGFb activation between injury models, or because global TGFb signaling in our model was partially rather than completely
inhibited. Alternatively, increased immune infiltration in AstTbr2DN mice early after stroke could increase GFAP expression via another pathway, for example, NF-jB signaling (Gao
1238

et al., 2013; Krohn et al., 1999), which would compensate
for reduced GFAP expression caused by reduced astrocytic
TGFb signaling.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that inhibiting endogenous astrocytic TGFb signaling during the subacute period
after stroke prevents the upregulation of functional TGFb
and its signaling in the peri-infarct cortex and strongly exacerbates infiltration and activation of innate immune cells.
Because TGFb is upregulated universally in acute and chronic
brain injury, it may represent a universal pathway that mediates the endogenous immunoregulatory functions of astrocytes. The anti-inflammatory and prorecovery functions of
astrocytic TGFb signaling may therefore extend to other
acute insults, such as traumatic brain injury or CNS infection, which are also characterized by increased TGF-b1
(Buckwalter and Wyss-Coray, 2004).
