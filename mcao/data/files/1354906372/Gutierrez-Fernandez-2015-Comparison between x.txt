Abstract
Background: Rat adipose tissue-derived-mesenchymal stem cells (rAD-MSCs) have proven to be safe in experimental
animal models of stroke. However, in order to use human AD-MSCs (hAD-MSCs) as a treatment for stroke patients, a
proof of concept is needed. We analyzed whether the xenogeneic hAD-MSCs were as safe and effective as allogeneic
rAD-MSCs in permanent Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (pMCAO) in rats.
Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups, which were intravenously injected with
xenogeneic hAD-MSCs (2 × 106), allogeneic rAD-MSCs (2 × 106) or saline (control) at 30 min after pMCAO. Behavior, cell
implantation, lesion size and cell death were evaluated. Brain markers such as GFAP (glial fibrillary acid protein), VEGF
(vascular endothelial growth factor) and SYP (synaptophysin) and tumor formation were analyzed.
Results: Compared to controls, recovery was significantly better at 24 h and continued to be so at 14 d after IV
administration of either hAD-MSCs or rAD-MSCs. No reduction in lesion size or migration/implantation of cells in the
damaged brain were observed in the treatment groups. Nevertheless, cell death was significantly reduced with respect
to the control group in both treatment groups. VEGF and SYP levels were significantly higher, while those of GFAP
were lower in the treated groups. At three months, there was no tumor formation.
Conclusions: hAD-MSCs and rAD-MSCs were safe and without side effects or tumor formation. Both treatment groups
showed equal efficacy in terms of functional recovery and decreased ischemic brain damage (cell death and glial scarring)
and resulted in higher angiogenesis and synaptogenesis marker levels.

Introduction
Worldwide, stroke is the second cause of death and
the leading cause of disability [1]. Currently, only one
thrombolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), is
approved for the treatment of ischemic stroke; however,
given its narrow therapeutic window, only 2–3% of all
stroke patients can benefit from the use of tPA. Stroke is a
clinical entity that requires more innovative treatments for
both brain protection and repair. Cell-based therapy is an

interesting area for developing a new approach to cerebral
infarct.
Along these lines, adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal
stem cells (AD-MSCs) from rodents have demonstrated
safety, feasibility and efficacy in experimental animal
models of stroke [2-4]. Moreover, AD-MSCs are abundant,
easy to obtain with minimally invasive techniques and can
be administrated without ethical concerns. In fact, rat
AD-MSCs (rAD-MSCs) are as effective as rat bone
marrow-derived MSCs (rBM-MSCs) following ischemic
stroke in obtaining improved functional recovery in rats
[2] and are even more effective in trophic factor secretion
[3,5]. However, to test the safety of human AD-MSCs
(hAD-MSCs) before using them as a treatment for
stroke patients, a proof of concept is needed. Having

demonstrated that rAD-MSCs are effective in experimental
animals, it is now important to test whether xenogeneic
hAD-MSCs are as safe and effective as allogeneic
rAD-MSCs after stroke in rats.
We administered both hAD-MSCs (xenogeneic administration) and rAD-MSCs (allogeneic administration) in an
experimental animal model of stroke to analyze and
compare their safety and effectiveness.

Methods
Animals

The subjects were adult male Sprague–Dawley rats, with
an average body weight range of 250–320 gr (Harlan
Iberica S.L.). The animals were housed with free access
to food and water at a room temperature of 21 ± 2°C,
relative humidity of 45 ± 15% and a light/dark cycle of
12h (7:00 to 19:00). The procedure was carried out at our
Cerebrovascular and Neuroscience Research Laboratory. All
experiments were designed to minimize animal suffering in
compliance with our medical school’s Ethical Committee
for the Care and Use of Animals in Research (EU directives
86/609/CEE and 2003/65/CE). The researchers responsible
for functional evaluation and the molecular and histological
studies were blinded to the treatment groups.
Study design
Isolation and characterization of AD-MSCs

The hAD-MSCs were provided by Cellerix and were
obtained from lipoaspirates from healthy donors. The
rAD-MSCs were extracted from abdominal adipose tissue
of adult Sprague–Dawley rats (250 to 300 g) as previously
described [2]. Briefly, the extracted tissue was washed with
sterile PBS and digested with an equal volume of 0.075%
type I collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich). The filtered cells
were centrifuged at 390g for 10min and contaminating
erythrocytes were removed to isolate the stromal vascular
fraction (SVF) that was cultured in Dulbecco modified
Eagle medium (1X) (DMEM Glu/Pyr, Gibco), 75 μl
penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 20% fetal
bovine serum (PAA Laboratories). On the third pass, cells
were trypsinized and counted before being administered
to the experimental animals.
To confirm the presence or absence of MSCs surface
markers using the flow cytometric technique, the cells were
incubated for 20 min at 4°C in the dark with the following
antibodies: CD90-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (AbD
Serotec), CD29-Phycoerythrin (PE) (AbD Serotec), CD45-PE
(AbD Serotec) and CD11b-PE (AbD Serotec). Matched
isotype controls were purchased from Biolegend. At least
1×104 cells per sample were acquired and analyzed [2].

cerebral ischemia in 2 rats, hypothermia due to anesthesia
in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) occurred in 3 rats
and microembolization after allogeneic cell administration
(rAD-MSCs) occurred in 1 rat.
The animals were randomly assigned to one of five
experimental groups: 1-The Healthy group (n = 6); 2-The
sham-operated group, which underwent surgery without
infarct and received a saline solution in the femoral vein
(n = 6; n = 3 sacrificed at 14 d and n = 3 sacrificed
at 3 months); 3-The control group, which underwent
surgery with permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO) and received the saline infusion in the femoral
vein (n = 15; n = 10 sacrificed at 14 d and n = 5 sacrificed
at 3 months); 4-The hAD-MSCs group, which underwent
pMCAO surgery and received an hAD-MSCs infusion in
the femoral vein (n = 15; n = 10 sacrificed at 14 d and
n = 5 sacrificed at 3 months); 5- The rAD-MSCs group,
which underwent pMCAO surgery and received an
rAD-MSCs infusion in the femoral vein (n = 15; n = 10
sacrificed at 14 d and n = 5 sacrificed at 3 months).
Details of the experimental protocol are shown in
Figure 1.
Surgical procedure

Anesthesia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of a
solution of ketamine (25 mg/kg), diazepam (2 mg/kg), and
atropine (0.1 mg/kg) at a dose of 2.5 ml/kg. Analgesia was
provided by meloxicam 2 mg/kg via a subcutaneous route.
A small craniectomy was made above the rhinal fissure
over the branch of the right middle cerebral artery
(MCA). The MCA branch was permanently ligated just
before its bifurcation into the frontal and parietal branches
with a 9–0 suture. Both common carotid arteries were
then occluded for 60 min as previously described [6,7].
In all animals, the femoral artery was cannulated
during surgery and ischemia to allow continuous
monitoring of physiological parameters (glycemia, blood
gases and blood pressure) (Monitor Omicron ALTEA
RGB medical devices).
Cell administration

The treatment was administered during the acute phase in
order to modulate both protective and repair mechanisms
from the very beginning. Thus, intravenous injections of
2×106 AD-MSCs in 650μl saline were administered for 4
min through the femoral vein at 30 min after common
carotid artery reperfusion. Control and sham-operated
received a saline infusion only. The route, dose and
timing of administration were used in a previous study,
with good results [2,6].

Figure 1 Experimental protocol. Animals were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) to induce cerebral ischemia.
Rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, which were intravenously injected with saline (control), hAD-MSCs (2 × 106) and rAD-MSCs (2 × 106)
in the femoral vein 30 min after stroke. The analyzed parameters were as follows: at 24 h and 14 d, a functional evaluation by Roger’s scale, migration
and implantation of MSCs and assessment of lesion size using MRI; at 14 d, migration, implantation and biodistribution of MSCs and a histological and
molecular analysis of the peri-infarct zone; at 3 months, tumor formation by inmmunohistochemistry. Sham-operated and healthy animals were also
subjected to the same parameter analyses.

acclimatized in a quiet place for one hour before
functional evaluation. A variant of Roger’s functional
scale was used to assign scores as follows: 0, no functional deficit; 1, failure to extend forepaw fully; 2,
decreased grip of forelimb while tail gently pulled; 3,
spontaneous movement in all directions, contralateral
circling only if pulled by the tail; 4, circling; 5, walking
only when stimulated; 6, unresponsive to stimulation with
a depressed level of consciousness; and 7, dead (n = 10
per group) [6,8].
Migration and implantation of AD-MSCs as studied by MRI
and DiI

For AD-MSCs Endorem labeling, (superparamagnetic
iron oxide) we adapted the protocol described by Arbab
AS et al. [9]. Cultures were incubated in DMEM and
protamine sulphate (6mg/ml) in the presence of Endorem
(50μl/ml) at 37°C for 4 h. After incubation, cells were
washed with PBS to eliminate excess labeling and were
administered to five animals in each group. Migration
and implantation were both analyzed using magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) with T2 maps (Flash sequence)
at 24 h and 14 d after administration.
For DiI labeling (Celltracker CM-DiI, Invitrogen), cells
in suspension were incubated with DiI tracker (1mg/ml)
in Hanks (1X) (HBSS, Gibco) for 10 min at 37°C and
later, for 30 min at 4°C. After incubation, cells were
washed with PBS to eliminate excess labeling and were
administered to animals (n = 5 animals per group).
Migration and implantation were then analyzed using
immunofluorescence at 14 d after administration.

Cell viability was checked by Trypan blue staining,
showing a survival >90%. Neither labeling agent affected
the baseline characteristics of the MSCs.
Biodistribution and tumor formation

Biodistribution of labeled AD-MSCs (2×106) with DiI after
IV administration was analyzed using immunofluorescence
techniques in treated animals at 14 d after administration.
Cryosections (10 μm thick) of brain, kidney, liver, lung and
spleen were labeled with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) and CD11b/c (monoclonal antibody diluted 1:300,
BD Biosciences) and were analyzed by immunofluorescence
staining.
Moreover, tumor formation and the presence of infiltrating cells were analyzed in the brain and the peripheral
organs at three months after AD-MSCs IV administration
in five treated animals using gross macroscopic study and
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
Measurement of lesion size by MRI and H&E

Lesion size was analyzed at 24 h and 14 d after surgery
on MRI (Bruker Pharmascan Germany 7 Tesla horizontal
bore magnets) using T2 maps (RARE 8 T2, 180° flip angle,
3 averages). Ten contiguous coronal slices (thickness: 1
mm) were acquired with a field of view of 35 X 35 mm
and a matrix size of 256 X 256 [repetition time (TR) 3000
ms, echo time (TE) 29.5 ms, imaging time 25.5 min,
3 averages]. All images were processed using the J
1.42 Image program (NIH software). To correct for
the brain edema effect, lesion size was determined by
an indirect method: (infarct area) = (area of the intact

Gutiérrez-Fernández et al. Journal of Translational Medicine (2015) 13:46

contralateral hemisphere)–(area of the intact ipsilateral
hemisphere) [2,10].
Lesion size was also estimated with H&E staining of
brain sections at 14 d. The samples were coronally
sectioned in 10 μm thick slices and digitalized images
were made of these slices (Epson Perfection 1260
scanner) and were used to automatically measure the
ischemic area (Image Pro plus 4.0, Media Cybernetics,
USA) [11]. To check whether H&E showed the infarct
area, MAP-2 staining (polyclonal antibody diluted 1:1000,
Millipore) and GFAP staining (monoclonal antibody
diluted 1:400, Chemicon) was performed.

1:400, Chemicon); VEGF (polyclonal antibody diluted 1:500,
Millipore); SYP (monoclonal antibody diluted 1:200, Sigma);
and β-actin (monoclonal antibody diluted 1:400, Sigma),
which was used as a normalizing control. After rinsing with
0.5% TBS-T solution, the membranes were incubated with
the secondary antibody, a donkey anti-rabbit and antimouse antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected
by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham) before
exposure on radiographic film. The density of stained bands
was scanned and quantified (arbitrary units, AU) by Scion
Image and 1-D Manager Version 2.1 (Scion Corporation,
Maryland, US).

Cell death

Cell death was detected in the peri-infarct zone by TUNEL
staining (TdT-FragEL DNA Fragmentation Detection Kit,
Oncogene Research Products). Cell counts were performed
on one slice from each animal (n = 10 per group), which
was taken at 1.6mm posterior to the bregma. The number
of positive cells was counted in a minimum of 10 different
microscopic fields based on their nuclear morphology and
dark color [2] using a 40× objective and image analysis
software (Image-Pro Plus 4.1, Media Cybernetics).

Statistical analysis

Quantitative data are shown as mean values ± SD. The
Kruskal–Wallis test followed by the Mann–Whitney test
were used to compare the functional evaluation score,
lesion size and cell death, while VEGF, SYP and GFAP
levels were compared among the various groups. Values of
p < 0.05 were considered significant at a 95% confidence
level (using statistical software SPSS 16 for Windows).

Immunofluorescence

Characterization of AD-MSCs

The peri-infarct area was analyzed in brain sections
using various immunofluorescent antibodies to mark:
astrocytes with glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)
(monoclonal antibody diluted 1:400, Chemicon); vascular
endothelial growth factor with VEGF (polyclonal antibody
diluted 1:500, Millipore), synaptogenesis with synaptophysin
(SYP) (monoclonal antibody diluted 1:200, Sigma).
Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were goat
anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor
594 (1: 750, Invitrogen). All sections were mounted with
H-1200 VectaShield mounting medium for fluorescence
with DAPI (ATOM). Samples were examined using a
LEICA TCS SPE spectral confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) and the confocal
images were analyzed using LEICA software LAS AF,
version 2.0.1 Build 2043. The images were acquired as a
confocal maximum projection.

We confirmed that CD90-FITC (AbD Serotec) and
CD29-PE (AbD Serotec) surface markers were positive
(all >90%) in AD-MSCs whereas the CD45-PE (AbD
Serotec) and CD11b-PE (AbD Serotec) surface markers
were negative (all <3%) (Figure 2). The AD-MSCs showed
typical, fibroblast-like cell morphology.

Western blot

Proteins were isolated from peri-infarct tissue and their
concentrations determined using a BCA protein assay
kit (Pierce). Twenty micrograms of protein were loaded
onto 10% acrylamide SDS-gels. Following electrophoresis
at 100 V for 1 h, the protein was transferred to PVDF
membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5%
fat-free dry milk dissolved in Tris-buffered saline pH 8.0
(TBS) plus 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h and probed
overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies at the
designated dilutions: GFAP (monoclonal antibody diluted

Xenogeneic and allogeneic AD-MSCs administration
improves functional recovery after pMCAO

Animals were functionally evaluated at 24 h and 14 d
and the corresponding score was obtained for each
group (Figure 3A). The sham-operated group did not
show functional deficits. The treated groups showed
good functional recovery without significant differences
between treated groups at either time point. In the
Rogers’ test, the hAD-MSCs (1.3 ± 0.6;0.2 ± 0.4) and
rAD-MSCs (1.5 ± 0.7;0 ± 0) groups had significantly
improved functional recovery compared with the control group (3.4 ± 0.89; 2.6 ± 0.89) at 24 h and at 14
d, respectively (p < 0.05).
Xenogeneic and allogeneic AD-MSCs administration does
not reduce infarct size after pMCAO

Lesion sizes at 24 h and 14 d after the experimental
procedure were evaluated on MRI (Figure 3B). Neither of
the treatments, hAD-MSCs (18.7 ± 4.2; 15.01 ± 3.4) or
rAD-MSCs (17.2 ± 9.2; 12.2 ± 6), reduced the lesion size
significantly with respect to the control group (21.89 ±
4.38; 13.12 ± 3.16). In addition, H&E staining showed

the hAD-MSCs (21 ± 6.7) and rAD-MSCs (24 ± 8.8)
groups in the peri-infarct zone (Figure 3E).
Xenogeneic and allogeneic AD-MSCs administration
modified brain marker levels after pMCAO

At 14 d after pMCAO, the levels of brain repair markers
(VEGF and SYP) were analyzed by immunofluorescence
(Figure 4A) and confirmed with the Western blot technique
(Figure 4B). Compared with the control group (2.75 ± 1.38
AU), rat brain VEGF levels were significantly higher after
administration of either hAD-MSCs (5.92 ± 1.38 AU) or
rAD-MSCs (5.05 ± 1.16 AU). The levels of SYP were also
significantly higher than in the control group (2.15 ± 0.22
AU) after hAD-MSCs (3.45 ± 0.23 AU) and rAD-MSCs
(3.06 ± 0.15 AU) treatments. Regarding the astrocyte
marker GFAP, its levels were significantly decreased after
treatment with either hAD-MSCs (2.098 ± 0.13 AU) or
rAD-MSCs (2.075 ± 0.17 AU) in comparison with the
control group (3.76 ± 0.31 AU). In no case did we observe
any significant differences in brain markers between the
hAD-MSCs- or rAD-MSCs-treated groups.
Neither AD-MSCs migration nor implantation was observed
in the injured brain area after IV administration

that neither hAD-MSCs (14.8 ± 3.06) or rAD-MSCs
(13.7 ± 3.20), had decreased lesion size significantly
with respect to the control group (16.98 ± 7.03) at 14 d
(Figure 3C). These results were confirmed by MAP-2 and
GFAP staining (Figure 3D).
Xenogeneic and allogeneic AD-MSCs administration

Sham-operated animals did not show TUNEL+ cells.
There were no TUNEL+ cells in the contralateral hemisphere in any operated animal. At 14 d, the control group

The possible migration and implantation of AD-MSCs
were studied by MRI at 24 h and 14 d and by immunofluorescence in DiI labeled cells at 14 d. Labeled AD-MSCs
were not observed in the control group because they were
not administered to this group. Endorem and DiI-labeled
AD-MSCs were only injected into the treated groups.
However, neither migration nor implantation was observed
on either MRI or immunofluorescence images in the
injured brain area after IV administration of either
hAD-MSCs or rAD-MSCs (Figure 5A,B). Nevertheless, we
did observe AD-MSCs biodistribution into peripheral
organs: the liver, lung and spleen. We found DiI co-labeling
with CD11b, indicating that the administered stem cells
were incorporated into macrophages. However, we did
not observe differences between the rAD-MSCs and
hAD-MSCs groups (Figure 5C).
Administration of xenogeneic or allogeneic AD-MSCs was
safe after pMCAO

The administration of hAD-MSCs or rAD-MSCs showed
no side effects or tumor formation at three months in any
treatment group, demonstrating the safety of this treatment. When we analyzed histological sections of various
organs where we found labeled AD-MSCs (spleen, lung
and liver) at three months after administration, no tumor
formation or cell infiltrate were observed. Moreover, other
organs, such as the kidney, showed no tissue alterations.
No differences were observed when comparing rAD-MSCs
and hAD-MSCs (xenogeneic and allogeneic, respectively)
(Figure 5D).

staining was used to confirm the lesion zone (D). Cell death was evaluated by TUNEL staining in the peri-infarct zone at 14 d (40×) (E) (scale bars

Discussion
In our study, the IV administration of MSCs from
human adipose tissue (xenogeneic administration) was
shown to be as safe as those from rat adipose tissue
(allogeneic administration) in an experimental stroke
model, producing no critical adverse effects or evidence of tumor formation during the three-month
follow-up. Furthermore, the treatment was effective,
inducing decreased cell death and increased brain
plasticity markers.
MSCs have shown great promise as a cell-based therapy
for many human diseases such as stroke, as a result of
their multipotency, high proliferation capacity and low
immunogenicity, including immunomodulatory protective
and repair effects. Moreover, these types of cells are

known to secrete multiple growth factors and thereby
have cytoprotective effects in various injury models. There
are several MSCs sources, including umbilical cord blood,
bone marrow and adipose tissue. All of these sources
have been used in experimental animals and some
have been used in clinical trials such as NCT00875654,
NCT01297413, NCT02283879 [12].
Among all of these sources, AD-MSCs are abundant,
have greater availability, are ethically acceptable and are
easy to obtain without invasive surgery. They can be
obtained in high amounts through simple procedures
such as liposuction or abdominoplasty and they have
been used in a number of animal models of stroke, in
which improved functional scores, reductions in infarct
size and modulation of inflammation were observed

[4,13]. Moreover, AD-MSCs have low MHC-I expression
and lack MHC-II molecules, suggesting that they are not
likely induce rejection [14]. Along these lines, previous
studies from our group showed no symptoms of rejection
after acute allogeneic administration of MSCs after pMCAO
in rats [2,6]. Therefore, AD-MSCs are especially interesting for clinical application to stroke [15-17], and in
fact, phase I and II clinical trials are now ongoing to
evaluate the safety of AD-MSCs administration for
other pathologies such as NCT01300598, NCT01649700,
NCT01739504 [12].
Xenogeneic and allogeneic AD-MSCs administration
improve functional recovery after pMCAO

In experimental animal models, administration of
human or rat MSCs has shown a significant effect
on functional outcome in stroke [2,6,13,18-21]. Our
present results have shown that hAD-MSCs as well as
rAD-MSCs administration is effective after cerebral
ischemia in terms of improving functional recovery.
Both treatments showed the same benefit regardless
of cell origin (xenogeneic vs. allogeneic). Because only one
motor functional evaluation test was used, futures studies
should analyze the effects of AD-MSCs administration
on coordination, cognitive and memory impairments
after stroke.

Neither AD-MSCs migration nor implantation was observed
in the injured brain area after IV administration

Previous studies showed good results in terms of
functional outcomes after IV MSCs administration in
the absence of cell grafting in the lesion area [6]. In
the present study, although functional outcomes were
good, neither IV-administered hAD-MSCs nor AD-MSCs
migrated or showed implantation in the injured brain,
suggesting that it might not be necessary for the
AD-MSCs reach the brain in order to exert their
therapeutic effects. In fact, we observed that after IV
administration, MSCs were found in various peripheral
organs such as the spleen, lung and liver, in agreement
with previous studies in which the authors hypothesized
that the administered cells might act indirectly from
peripheral organs (spleen, lung and liver) [22-24].
Regarding cell clearance from peripheral organs, a
recent study suggested that xenografting has an impact
on cell clearance from the brain and faster relocation of
human MSCs to the liver and spleen compared to rat
MSCs [25]. However, in our study we observed no
difference either in implantation or clearance between
rAD-MSCs and hAD-MSCs, as measured with co-labeling
with macrophage staining.
In a translational context, safety and tumor formation
should be analyzed for stem cell therapy optimization.

injection were studied in the ischemic brain by either MRI or immunofluorescence at 14 d. C) The presence of AD-MSCs administered to treated
groups was checked in peripheral organs: liver, lungs and spleen at 14 d by DiI staining and also by co-labeling with CD11b/c (detail). D) H&E
staining was used to study possible tumor formation in the kidney, liver, lung or spleen at 3 months after AD-MSCs administration (scale bars =
20 μm) (n = 5 per group).

Despite earlier concerns regarding the potential tumorigenic property of stem cells, a survey of current studies reveals only a few instances of tumor formation
following MSCs administration [26]. One study
showed that xenotransplantation of human MSCs
into immunocompetent wild-type rats did not result
in any of the apparent gross or microscopic findings
consistent with abnormal immunologic reactions [27].
In our study, AD-MSCs demonstrated safety and no
adverse effects independent of cellular origin (xenogeneic or allogeneic source), and they did not cause
tumor formation in any organ at three months after
administration.

In a previous study, AD-MSCs markedly attenuated
brain infarct size in rats [7]. However, in the present
study, although an improvement functional recovery was
observed even at 24 h, AD-MSCs administration did not
reduce lesion sizes in treated animals in comparison to
control animals. However, this apparent lack of protection
was compensated by a reduction in cell death, as we found
that the number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly
higher in the control group than in MSCs-treated groups.
These results suggest that although the infarct size is not
reduced, early tissue preservation occurs as there is

Gutiérrez-Fernández et al. Journal of Translational Medicine (2015) 13:46

reduced cell death. This result agrees with previous
studies in which AD-MSCs also inhibited cell death
after stroke [2,4,28].

Xenogeneic and allogeneic AD-MSCs administration
modified brain marker levels after pMCAO

Numerous studies have shown that MSCs might exert
their beneficial effects through secreted trophic factors,
which directly or indirectly promote ischemic brain
tissue repair. MSCs are stimulated to secrete various
trophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), VEGF, nerve growth factor (NGF) and
HGF, which have been implicated in endogenous repair
mechanisms [19].
In line with these studies, at 14 d, we found that
the animals receiving AD-MSCs treatment showed a
significant increase in levels of VEGF and SYP and a
significant decrease in GFAP markers. Administered
MSCs might play roles in angiogenesis (VEGF) and
synaptogenesis (SYP), processes implicated in brain
repair. Other studies have reported similar results
after MSCs administration with an increase in VEGF
[3,6,29,30] as well as in SYP markers [2,31]. In respect to
GFAP, an astrocyte marker, in our study we observed
a decrease in its expression in the peri-infarct zone in
treated animals with respect to the control group,
which is in line with a previous report by Leu et al.
[4]. Brain damage triggers reactive gliosis, which is
characterized by increased expression of specific
markers such as GFAP surrounding the injury site. In the
reactive process, the astrocytes participate in glial scar
formation, becoming hypertrophied and inhibiting axonal
regeneration [32].
The beneficial effects after MSCs administration could
be partly mediated by paracrine factors produced by
these administered cells; however mechanisms of action
for this mediation are as yet unknown. The mechanisms
would likely involve stimulation of an active repair response
that becomes operational in the acute to subacute time
frame [22].

Conclusions
The administration of hAD-MSCs or rAD-MSCs has
been shown to be safe and without side effects or tumor
formation. Furthermore, both treatment groups showed
equal efficacy in terms of functional recovery and
decreased ischemic brain damage (reduction in cell death
and glial scarring) as well as increases in angiogenesis and
synaptogenesis markers.
