ABSTRACT
Concurrent damage to the lateral frontal and parietal
cortex is common following middle cerebral artery
infarction, leading to upper extremity paresis, paresthesia, and sensory loss. Motor recovery is often poor, and
the mechanisms that support or impede this process
are unclear. Since the medial wall of the cerebral hemisphere is commonly spared following stroke, we investigated the spontaneous long-term (6 and 12 month)
effects of lateral frontoparietal injury (F2P2 lesion) on
the terminal distribution of the corticospinal projection
(CSP) from intact, ipsilesional supplementary motor cortex (M2) at spinal levels C5 to T1. Isolated injury to the
frontoparietal arm/hand region resulted in a significant
loss of contralateral corticospinal boutons from M2
compared with controls. Specifically, reductions
occurred in the medial and lateral parts of lamina VII

and the dorsal quadrants of lamina IX. There were no
statistical differences in the ipsilateral CSP. Contrary to
isolated lateral frontal motor injury (F2 lesion), which
results in substantial increases in contralateral M2
labeling in laminae VII and IX (McNeal et al. [2010] J.
Comp. Neurol. 518:586–621), the added effect of adjacent parietal cortex injury to the frontal motor lesion
(F2P2 lesion) not only impedes a favorable compensatory neuroplastic response but results in a substantial
loss of M2 CSP terminals. This dramatic reversal of the
CSP response suggests a critical trophic role for cortical somatosensory influence on spared ipsilesional
frontal corticospinal projections, and that restoration of
a favorable compensatory response will require therapeutic intervention. J. Comp. Neurol. 523:669–697,

The corticospinal projection (CSP) is the longest fiber
pathway in the central nervous system. Its circuitry specializations, especially pronounced in some higher order
primates, establish the underlying capacity to produce
highly coordinated, fractionated movements of the digits. Although an extensive region of the cerebral cortex
is known to harbor CSP neurons (Biber et al., 1978;
Murray and Coulter, 1981; Nudo and Masterton, 1988,
1990; Dum and Strick 1991; Galea and Darian-Smith,
1994; Luppino et al., 1994; Rozzi et al., 2006), the projection from the primary motor cortex (M1) is widely
known for its special structural and functional contributions to generating contralateral skilled, voluntary hand
movements. These coordinated hand movements

include opposition of the tips of the fingers to the
thumb, grip formation, and object manipulation (see,

Numerous experimental approaches have been
instrumental in defining the unique structural and functional characteristics of the M1 CSP in nonhuman primates, and one of the oldest and enduring methods
includes precentral cortical resection (see, e.g., Ferrier,
1886, Graham Brown and Sherrington, 1913; Leyton
and Sherrington, 1917; for review see Vilensky and Gilman, 2002; Darling et al., 2011; Wiesendanger, 2011).
After isolated resection of M1, a short period of flaccid
paralysis ensues that is followed by remarkable recovery of upper extremity movements. However, a hallmark
clinical feature of extensive precentral resection that
includes the anterior bank of the central sulcus is more
lasting deficits in fine control of contralesional digit
movements for manipulating small objects in macaques
(Ogden and Franz 1917, Fulton and Kennard 1934) and
humans (Bucy, 1949). In nonhuman primates, adaptive
mechanisms that accompany precentral injury and
upper limb recovery include physiological reorganization
of adjacent lateral premotor cortex (see, e.g., Glees and
Cole, 1950; Black et al., 1974; Nudo et al., 1996; Rouiller et al., 1998; Liu and Rouiller, 1999; Frost et al.,
2003; Dancause et al., 2006) and rewiring of corticocortical connections from the ventrolateral premotor
cortex (Dancause et al., 2005). In the supplementary
motor cortex (M2, SMC, or SMA-proper), increased unit
activity (Aizawa et al., 1991), expansion of the distal
forelimb region (Esiner-Janowicz et al., 2008) and
enhanced terminal labeling of CSP (McNeal et al.,
2010) have been shown to occur after lateral frontal
motor injury.
In contrast to the abundant studies examining the
effects of isolated lateral frontal motor injury on recovery of upper extremity movements in nonhuman primates, there have been few experimental studies
examining the effects of isolated postcentral injury on
upper extremity movement. The available evidence from
some highly regarded authorities shows that localized
parietal lobe lesions may produce serious motor deficits. Notably, in a rarely cited study, Kennard and Kessler (1940) reported that isolated postcentral (primary
somatosensory cortex or S1) resection affects primarily
fine motor acts of the digits. These deficits were characterized by a lack of precision in both direction and
extent of movements, especially during grooming activities. Permanent loss of tactile placing was noted, and
accuracy of manipulation by the digits improved only
when visual attention was used. Remarkably, motor
recovery deficits were found to be more enduring following postcentral (somatosensory) injury than after
precentral (somatomotor) lesions, with progressive
improvements in recovery occurring over longer periods
of time following precentral injury. Denny-Brown (1950)

670

described postcentral lesions as having a devastating
effect on motor function that is equivalent to area 4
(M1) ablation, with additional persistent depression of
posture and postural reflexes. However, adaptive frontomotor mechanisms that accompany motor recovery
following isolated postcentral injury have not been
studied in the nonhuman primate model. Higher than
normal current levels are required to elicit movement
from M1 following dorsal column lesions that disrupt
ascending proprioceptive and tactile input to S1 (Kambi
et al., 2011), indicating that frontomotor mechanisms
are likely to be altered following somatosensory deprivation. This change in stimulation threshold is also
accompanied by reorganization of the M1 thumb area
map such that intracortical microstimulation causes
primarily abduction-adduction movements instead of
primarily flexion–extension movements as in control
monkeys.
It is clear that studies applying localized lesions confined to either the precentral or postcentral regions
were designed, in part, with the intent to determine
each representative contribution to altered patterns of
motor performance after injury as well as the negative
or positive effects that each lesion type might have on
the motor recovery process. However, it would be of
substantial interest to study the effects of combined
lateral frontal (M1) and lateral parietal (S1) lobe injury
on the recovery process of upper extremity movements
in the nonhuman primate model because this cortical
territory is often compromised as a collective unit in a
large number of stroke patients, as indicated by the
high incidence of motor weakness and sensory abnormalities resulting from middle cerebral artery (MCA)
embolic disease (Yoo et al., 1998). Indeed, the MCA
supplies the lateral part of the frontal and parietal lobes
(see, e.g., Tatu et al., 1998; Duvernoy, 1999) and is the
most frequently occluded artery in cerebrovascular
pathology (see, e.g., Bogousslavsky et al., 1990; Carrera et al., 2007). The poor motor recovery often noted
in these patients suggests that different neuronal
response mechanisms that are perhaps more unfavorable and limiting may accompany this type of injury vs.
isolated lesions limited to either the precentral or the
postcentral regions alone.
One cortical area that would be of significant interest
for studying the compensatory recovery mechanisms
following lateral frontoparietal injury is the medial frontal motor region. Indeed, the anterior cerebral artery
(ACA) supplies the medial wall of the cerebral hemisphere and is spared in the majority (>97%) of stroke
patients (Bogousslavsky and Regli, 1990; Kazui et al.,
1993; Kumral et al., 2002; Carrera et al., 2007). As we
have previously noted (McNeal et al., 2010), it is of

particular significance that the supplementary motor
cortex (M2), resides in the vascular territory of the
anterior cerebral artery. Moreover, M2 gives rise to the
second strongest (only to M1) CSP (Dum and Strick
1991; Galea and Darian-Smith, 1994) and is involved in
higher order motor functions, including motor planning
and movement sequencing (Tanji, 1994; Nachev et al.,
2008; Passingham et al., 2010). As such, M2 may represent an important resource in the recovery process of
upper extremity movement following common, lateral
frontoparietal cortical injury. Furthermore, this cortex may
contribute to the recovery of fine motor control of the digits because M2 has a relatively prominent projection to
alpha motoneuron-rich lamina IX (Dum and Strick, 1996;
Maier et al., 2002; McNeal et al., 2010), which has
recently been characterized as a monosynaptic projection
(Maier et al., 2002; Boudrias et al., 2006, 2010b).
Hence, the objective of this study was to examine
the effects of lateral frontoparietal injury on the spared
CSP from the supplementary motor cortex (M2) following spontaneous long-term (6 and 12 months) recovery.
We found that, in contrast to isolated lateral frontal
motor injury (F2 lesion), which gives rise to a substantial increase in the contralateral CSP from M2 in the
form of greater numbers of terminal boutons and
enhanced terminal fiber length vs. controls (McNeal
et al., 2010), the added effect of anterior parietal lobe
injury (F2P2 lesion) has devastating consequences for
the contralateral CSP from M2. This has important
implications for humans, who probably rely extensively,

if not exclusively, on the CSP for performing precisely
coordinated hand and finger movements.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were housed and
cared for in a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
and Association for Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care (AALAC) approved and
inspected facility. All behavioral, surgical, and experimental protocols were approved by the University of
South Dakota Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with USDA,
National Institutes of Health, and Society for Neuroscience guidelines for the ethical treatment of animals.
Prior to initiation of the study, each monkey was evaluated by a veterinarian with primate experience and
judged to be healthy and free of any neurological deficit.

Study design
To accomplish the aims of this investigation, the
organization of the CSP arising from M2 was studied at
spinal levels C5 to T1 in rhesus monkeys (M. mulatta).
Four control monkeys from our previous work (McNeal
et al., 2010; see Table 1) and one additional monkey
(SDM84) served as the control group. Four other monkeys received an isolated neurosurgical lesion (F2P2
lesion) using coagulation/subpial aspiration that
involved removal of the arm representation of M1 (area
4), lateral premotor cortex (LPMC or area 6), and arm

region of the adjacent somatosensory cortex (S1 or
areas 3, 1, and 2), including the rostral part of area PE
(or area 5) of the superior parietal lobule. Detailed
descriptions of the neurosurgical exposure, intracortical
microstimulation method, and aspiration method have
been reported previously (Morecraft et al., 2001, 2002,
2007a; McNeal et al., 2010). In the control group (Table
1), each monkey was injected with the tract tracer fluorescein dextran (FD) into the central region of the arm
representation of M2 and survived for 33 days prior to
perfusion. The 4 F2P2 lesion monkeys were also
injected with the same tracer (FD) in the central region
of the arm representation of M2 in the ipsilesional
hemisphere 33–34 days prior to sacrifice but after 6 or
12 months of recovery from the induced lateral frontoparietal lesion. After immunohistochemical tissue processing for microscopic visualization of the FD tract
tracer in all control and lesion cases, terminal boutons
were estimated in Rexed’s lamina at spinal levels C5–
T1 by stereological counting methods, which is widely
acknowledged as the most accurate method to quantify
these neuronal structures (Glaser et al., 2007; West,
2012). Terminal fiber lengths were also estimated in
lamina VII and IX and within the lateral corticospinal
tract (LCST) at C5 and C8 by stereology. Definitions of
general anatomical terminology adopted for this study
have been described previously (McNeal et al., 2010).

672

For the present report, M1 was further subdivided into
gyral or rostral part (M1r) and a sulcal or caudal part
(M1c; Rathelot and Strick, 2009; Table 2). Similarly, the
somatosensory cortex was subdivided into a rostral
(S1r) component that lined the fundus and posterior
bank of the central sulcus (cytoarchitectonic areas 3
and 1) and a caudal part (S1c) that resides on the gyral
surface of parietal cortex (cytoarchitectonic areas 1
and 2; Table 2).
Before the frontoparietal lesion was induced, the preferred hand in all four F2P2 lesion group monkeys was
determined by deriving a handedness index for each
animal (Nudo et al., 1992; Pizzimenti et al., 2007),
which served to identify the hemisphere that would be
lesioned (contralateral to the preferred hand). In addition, all monkeys in the lesion group were trained on
two fine motor behavioral tasks that involved reaching
for small food targets by using a modified movement
assessment panel (mMAP; Darling et al., 2006) and a
modified dexterity board (mDB; Pizzimenti et al., 2007).
Specifically, after reaching stable levels of motor performance on each task (approximately 18–28 testing
sessions after learning the task), each monkey was
lesioned and then tested once every week (on both
tasks) for the first 2 months postinjury and once every
other week (on both tasks) thereafter. Motor performances on individual trials were quantified from three-

dimensional video recordings of movements to acquire
small food pellets in the mDB task (Pizzimenti et al.,
2007) and from recordings of three-dimensional forces
applied to small carrot chips for the mMAP task (Darling et al., 2006). The animals in the control group were
provided with daily distal upper extremity motor enrichment activities (such as a foraging board) to compensate for potential learning/training-induced effects of
the F2P2 lesioned animals during the brief manual testing sessions (maximum of 40 trials with each hand to
acquire the food targets).

Neurosurgical and neuroanatomical
procedures
Neurosurgical and tract tracing procedures
Frontal lobe exposure was performed by following neurosurgical procedures previously described (Morecraft
et al., 2001, 2002, 2007a; McNeal et al., 2010). Briefly,
with each animal under isofluorane anesthesia, a skin
flap was made over the cranium, followed by a bone
flap over the midline region. In control cases and lesion
cases, the medial surface of the frontal lobe was
exposed by incising the dura matter and ligating bridging vessels emptying into the superior sagittal sinus
with the aid of a surgical microscope. Small pieces of
cottonoid pads were then gently packed into the interhemispheric sulcus to increase slowly the interhemispheric space, allowing the cortex lining the medial
frontal surface to be clearly visible.
In both the control and the lesion cases, the location
of the arm representation of M2 was determined by
intracortical microstimulation (McNeal et al., 2010).
Then, the anterograde neural tract tracer FD (10% solution in saline comprising an equal quantity of both
3,000 MW and 10,000 MW volumes; Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR) was injected into the central region of the
physiologically localized arm representation of M2. Specifically, graded pressure injections with a Hamilton
microsyringe were made into three separate penetration
sites spaced 1–1.5 mm apart in a triangular pattern,
2.5–3.5 mm below the medial cortical surface at
approximately a 10–20 angle from the vertical axis. In
the control cases, a total of 1.2 ml of neural tracer was
injected (i.e., 0.4 ml per penetration site; Table 1). The
tract tracer injections in the F2P2 lesion cases were
performed in identical fashion with the exception that
slightly less tracer volume (total of 0.9 ml; 0.3 ml per
penetration site) was injected in three of the lesion
cases (Table 1), and a volume that was equal to the
controls (1.2 ml) was injected in one lesion case
(SDM91; Table 1). The smaller volume of FD injected
into the first three F2P2 lesion animals were originally

made to match the experimental design for our F2
lesion animals (removal of M1 arm/hand region and
adjacent LPMC; n 5 4; see McNeal et al., 2010). In the
F2 lesion experiments, we were able to demonstrate
clearly that 0.9 ml of FD injected into the spared M2
arm area provided more than an adequate amount of
tracer to label two or three times the number of labeled
CSP terminal boutons (and terminal axon fiber length)
vs. all the control cases that received 1.2 ml of FD
(McNeal et al., 2010). To verify that the experimental
results of the F2P2 lesion cases receiving 0.9 ml of FD
reflected a true loss of corticospinal terminal labeling,
we injected 1.2 ml of FD in our final experimental F2P2
lesion case (SDM91). The craniotomy was closed as
described previously (Morecraft et al., 2001, 2002,
2007a).

Tissue processing and immunohistochemical
procedures
After the survival period following tract tracer injection,
each monkey was deeply anesthetized with an overdose
of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg or more) and perfused
transcardially with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde and sucrose as previously described (Morecraft et al., 2013). After an appropriate period for
cryoprotection, the cerebral cortex was frozen and cut
in the coronal plane at a thickness of 50 mm in cycles
of 10, and the spinal cord was cut horizontally at a
thickness of 50 mm in cycles of six. One series of cortical and spinal cord tissue sections was stained for Nissl
substance for cytoarchitectural analysis with thionin
(Morecraft et al., 1992, 2004, 2012, 2013). Subsequent
series of tissue sections through the cortex and spinal
cord were then processed using single- and doublelabel immunohistochemical procedures for visualization
of the injected neural tracers as previously described
(Morecraft et al., 2007a, 2013). To verify that the FD
antibody and subsequent tissue labeling process
resulted in staining only the injected and transported
tract tracer, sections from the prefrontal cortex and
occipital lobe were immunohistochemically processed,
and parts of these cortices that are not connected to
M2 (Luppino et al., 1993; Morecraft eta l., 2012) were
examined for false FD labeling. Neuronal immunohistochemical labeling was not found in these control tissue
sections, demonstrating that false labeling was not
present in the final tissue specimens used for analysis.

Stereological analysis
The methods used to calculate unbiased estimated bouton numbers at specific spinal levels and within specific
spinal cord laminae are provided in detail in our previous articles (McNeal et al., 2010; Morecraft et al.,

(i.e., putative boutons or terminal-like profiles) were
defined as small swellings along the terminal fibers that
were 0.5–3.5 mm in diameter (Lawrence et al., 1985;
Wouterlood and Groenewegen, 1985: Freese and Amaral, 2006; Morecraft et al., 2007b; Fig. 2). Unbiased
estimates of the total number of terminal boutons
within Rexed’s laminae (and subdivisions) were determined by using the optical fractionator (Microbrightfield,
Colchester, VT). Briefly, we calculated the average

section thickness, overall fraction of tissue thickness
that would be analyzed, overall fraction of sectional
area, and overall number of tissue sections under analysis that contain the region of interest (ROI; i.e., spinal
cord laminae and subdivisions). Using the sectional
area and the average tissue thickness, we then constructed counting bricks and counted axon terminal
boutons with unbiased counting rules (West et al.,
1991; Larsen et al., 1998; West, 2012). The stereological parameters included the counting brick dimensions,

tissue thickness, counting brick placement, guard zone,
and dissector height. The same X/Y counting frame
(109.2/71.4 mm) and X/Y grid placement (125.3/
241.9 mm) were applied to all case material when performing stereology. To obtain an accurate estimate of
the total number of labeled particles of interest (i.e.,
terminal boutons) in each individual monkey spinal
cord, every other tissue section in a complete series of

processed sections was used for microscopic stereological analysis, and the total numbers of boutons within
each ROI were expressed as total number counted per
ROI per animal as previously described (Courtine et al.,
2008; McNeal et al., 2010).
To estimate terminal fiber length within these ROIs,
we employed the Spaceballs probe. This probe was
uniquely designed to satisfy isotropic requirements for

tissue processing that might not be feasible. Specifically,
because the probe is a virtual sphere, by definition all
orientations on the surface of the sphere have an equal
probability of being used (Mouton et al., 2002; West,
2012). To implement the probe, a computer software
package (StereoInvestigator; Microbrightfield) allowed us
to set the radius of the sphere and to maintain the
same stereological parameters (i.e., area section fraction, series section fraction, section thickness) as were
employed for the optical fractionator. The sphere was
also designed to be less than the thickness of the tissue. The designed virtual sphere was then superimposed
on the microscopic image. At successive focal planes
with a 3100 oil immersion objective, labeled fibers that
intersected the edge of the virtual sphere were counted
for every sighting within a given ROI. Estimates of terminal fiber length and associated coefficient of errors were
then calculated according to previously derived formulas
(Mouton et al., 2002; West, 2012).
The cortical ROIs to which stereology was applied
included the FD tract tracer injection site and the extirpated lesion site (Tables 1, 2). Unbiased estimates of
the total injection site volume (which included the core
volume) and core injection site volume were determined
by using the Cavalieri probe in the same StereoInvestigator software. To accomplish this, every cortical tissue
section spaced 500 mm apart through the injection site
in the FD-immunostained series of tissue sections was
used for analysis. The same probe and method were
used to determine the lesion site volume (gray and
white matter) as reported in our previous articles (Pizzimenti et al., 2007, Darling et al., 2009). Briefly, after
carefully evaluation of the gray matter and white matter
extent of the lesion site from Nissl-stained sections
through the lesioned hemisphere, the lesion site
boundaries were superimposed onto gray and white
matter regions on matching Nissl-stained sections
through the nonlesioned hemisphere (see Fig. 4, right
column, of Pizzimenti et al., 2007). The sections were
spaced 500 mm apart, and then the Cavalieri probe was
used to determine the volumes (Table 2).

Statistical analysis of neuroanatomical data
Statistical analyses were performed to determine
whether significant differences occurred in bouton numbers and terminal fiber lengths between the control and
lesion animals. Specifically, separate mixed two-way
repeated-measures ANOVAs were used to compare
these dependent variables in control vs. lesioned animals across the spinal laminae (I–IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX,
X, and RMB for spinal segments C5–T1). We also used
a mixed three-way repeated-measures ANOVA to compare bouton numbers within quadrants of lamina IX for

676

segments C5–T1. In this case the repeated-measures
factors were dorsal/ventral regions each subdivided
into medial and lateral quadrants. Mauchley’s test was
used to determine whether the assumption of sphericity
was met when there were three or more levels in a
repeated-measures factor (i.e., laminae). Adjustments in
degrees of freedom for F tests were made on the basis
of the Huynh-Feldt epsilon values, resulting in adjusted
P values, which are reported in Results. Statistical tests
were accomplished with the GraphPad InStat 3 statistical software package (GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, CA) or Statistica software (Statistica, Tulsa, OK).

Neuroanatomical data reconstruction and
presentation
Publication-quality images of injection sites and labeled
fibers were captured with a Spotflex 64-megapixel camera, (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI;
version 4.6), mounted on an Olympus BX51 microscope. Photographic montages of the injection sites
and labeled fibers were created in Adobe PhotoShop
7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Only brightness
and contrast were adjusted to maximize discrimination
and normalize images for comparative purposes. Cortical reconstructions and reconstruction of the physiological stimulation maps were developed as previously
described by using metrically calibrated digital images
of the cortical surface (Morecraft and Van Hoesen
1992, Morecraft et al., 2002, 2013). Publication-quality
line illustrations were created in Adobe Illustrator 10.0
(Adobe Systems Inc.).

Movement analysis procedures
Two apparati were used to test fine hand/digit motor
function: the modified movement assessment panel
(mMAP; Darling et al., 2006) and the modified dexterity
board (mDB; Pizzimenti et al., 2007), as previously
described (McNeal et al., 2010). Forces applied during
manipulation of the carrot chip in the mMAP task were
recorded at 200 samples/second using Datapac 2k2
(Run Technologies). Movements of the hand during the
mMAP task were recorded with a single digital video
camera (Sony model DCR-DVD301) to provide qualitative assessments of movement strategy and success/
failure on each trial. Quantitative video recordings of
hand movements during the mDB task from four cameras were used to assess spatial and temporal variables
(e.g., accuracy and duration of the initial reach, grip
aperture at touchdown).

Behavioral procedures
Prior to an experimental session, the monkey was food
restricted for 12–24 hours. The initial training sessions

used a “standard” rectangular dexterity board to assess
the preferred hand of each monkey, as described previously (Nudo et al., 1992). Hand preference was measured in 150 trials over a 3-day period (with 50 trials
conducted each day). We recorded 1) the hand used on
the initial reach for that trial, 2) the hand used on subsequent reaches, and 3) the hand used to retrieve the
pellet. A reach was defined when the animals hand
passed through the plane of the square portal window
located directly above the Kluver board. A subsequent
reach was defined if the hand was withdrawn into the
cage then extended back through the portal plane and
over the Kluver board. The handedness index (HI) was
computed as: (P – 50) 3 2, where P is the average percentage of initial reaches and retrievals with the preferred hand (hand with the higher percentage of initial
reaches and retrievals). HI ranges from 0 (50% of initial
reaches and retrievals with each hand) to 100 (all initial
reaches and retrievals with the preferred hand).
Training with the mMAP (Darling et al., 2006) and mDB
(Pizzimenti et al., 2007) devices commenced after hand
preference had been determined. Full testing sessions
with the mDB included five retrieval attempts for each of
the wells (A–E) for both limbs proceeding from the easiest
well (E) to the most difficult (A), for a total of 25 trials
with each hand. During postlesion tests, the more
impaired hand (contralateral to the surgically induced
lesion) was always tested first to ensure high motivation.
Full testing sessions with the mMAP included blocks of
five trials at each difficulty level with each hand, thereby
giving the monkey 30 opportunities to retrieve carrot
chips, 15 with each hand. During the first few postlesion
tests, the more impaired hand was tested first on the flat
surface task (easiest task) to ensure high motivation.
Thus, when considering both tests, a single testing session consisted of only 40 reaches for each hand.
Prelesion data were collected every 1–3 weeks for a
total of 18–28 sessions according to each monkey’s
ability to learn the task and perform consistently. The
final five prelesion experiments demonstrated relatively
stable levels of performance before lesions were made
to cortical motor areas. Postlesion data were collected
from both limbs during weekly experimental sessions
for the first 2 months after the surgery (i.e., one testing
session per week). Thereafter, tests were conducted
biweekly (i.e., one testing session every 2 weeks). After
initial training, it was only during the pre- and postlesion experimental sessions that the monkeys had exposure to the mMAP and mDB devices.

mMAP data analysis
Force data from the mMAP task were analyzed by visually identifying the first touch of the carrot chip or

678

plate/rod supporting the carrot chip to the end of force
application (i.e., when the carrot chip was removed
from the plate supported by the load cell or the rod) on
each trial using force recordings displayed in Datapac
2k2. The accompanying video data were also analyzed
to verify these times and to identify trial outcome. The
duration and total applied three-dimensional absolute
impulse were computed for each trial and, along with
trial outcome, used to compute a performance score.
After prelesion data collection was completed, performance scores were computed and normalized to individual monkey’s abilities (i.e., maximum and minimum
applied impulse and duration) for each trial at each difficulty level (McNeal et al. 2010).

mDB data analysis
Temporal characteristics of reaching, manipulation, and
3D locations of the tips of the index finger and thumb
were determined from the digital video files as
described previously and used to compute performance
scores for reaching and manipulation and an overall
score on each pre- and postlesion trial (Pizzimenti
et al., 2007). Measurements taken from video were
used to compute reach duration, accuracy, grip aperture, manipulation duration, and manipulation attempts
(number of times contact between the pellet and a digit
was lost and then reestablished) on each trial. These
measurements were each normalized to the performance ranges for each monkey prior to the lesion (i.e., to
maximum/minimum reach and manipulation duration,
least/most accurate reach, largest/smallest grip aperture, maximum/minimum number of manipulation
attempts) and used to compute the performance scores
(McNeal et al., 2010).

Analysis of hand motor skill
We quantitatively assessed overall motor skill by computing mean divided by the SD of manipulation performance scores over five consecutive testing sessions (i.e.,
25 trials over an approximately 5 week period; Pizzimenti et al. 2007; McNeal et al., 2010). These were
computed for the performance scores on the mMAP
curved rod task (which are computed from manipulation
duration and forces exerted during manipulation) and
for the manipulation scores on the mDB task (well with
highest prelesion skill for each monkey). Note that
higher mean performance scores (lower duration and
impulse on mMAP, lower duration and fewer lost contacts with the food pellet in the mDB tasks) and lower
variability of performances will result in higher skill values. Skill was computed for the best five consecutive
and last five prelesion test sessions and for the five
consecutive test sessions with the highest skill during

postlesion recovery. We also qualitatively analyzed each
lesioned monkey’s contralesional hand/digit motions in
the mDB and mMAP tasks to determine whether the
monkey’s strategy changed postlesion to use additional
digits or different digits to perform the task.

Statistical analysis of motor performance
We evaluated lesion effects on hand motor function from
the duration (in weeks) from the time of the lesion until
the first testing session with an attempt, successful
acquisition, and five successful acquisitions on the mMAP
(flat surface task) and mDB (any well) tasks in each monkey. Recovery of fine motor skill was defined as the ratio
of postlesion skill (highest skill for five consecutive test
sessions) to prelesion skill measured over the last five
testing sessions before the lesion on the best well (well
with highest prelesion skill) and the second smaller well
(with prelesion skill of approximately 50% of that on the
best well) of the mDB task and on the curved rod task of
the mMAP. These measures of recovery were entered
into single linear regression analyses to test whether
recovery was correlated with the ratio of bouton numbers
in individual lesioned monkeys to average number of boutons in control monkeys. Specifically, we considered the
number of boutons in laminae VII and IX in lesioned monkeys, which we previously showed were highly correlated
with recovery of skill in monkeys with lesions of M1 and
lateral premotor cortex (LPMC) but without damage to
parietal lobe (McNeal et al. 2010).

RESULTS
Microscopic analysis of the new control case
(SDM84; Fig. 3) and all F2P2 lesion cases (Figs. 1, 4)
revealed that all FD injections were confined to the
physiologically defined arm representation of M2

680

(cytoarchitectonic area 6m) and did not extend into the
fundus and lower bank of the cingulate sulcus to
involve the cingulate motor field. The core region of all
injection sites was largely confined to the medial wall
of the frontal cortex (Fig. 1) with the addition to the lip
of the dorsal convexity, which collectively is considered
to be part of the supplementary motor cortex (Woolsey
et al., 1952; Tanji and Kurata, 1982, 1985). All injection
sites were found to involve cortical layer V, which harbors the cells of origin of the CSP (Kuypers, 1981). The
M2 CSP of the new control case (SDM84) was added
to our previous control group of four animals (Tables 1,
3–5). In SDM84, the general distribution of the contralateral terminal projection was similar to that of all
other control cases, with the highest number of labeled
boutons located in lamina VII and IX (Fig. 5, Table 3).
The strongest projection to lamina IX in case SDM84
was localized to the dorsal lateral quadrant, followed by
the ventromedial quadrant (Table 5). The total number
of estimated contralateral labeled boutons in case
SDM84 was strikingly similar to that in case SDM54
(Table 3). Like the four previous control cases, the case
SDM84 ipsilateral M2 CSP terminated primarily in lamina VIII and the medial part of lamina VII (Table 4).

General experimental observations of the
F2P2 lesion cases
Immediately after the F2P2 lesion, all animals
showed clear impairment, with flaccid paresis of the
contralesional hand. Opposite the lesioned hemisphere,
a pendulous hand hung limply at the side and was not
used for postural support or grasping of objects. This
paresis lasted for 7–10 days after the lesion, when
hand function began to be reinstated to assist the
unimpaired hand during feeding and typical cage

behaviors such as grasping of the cage bars and climbing. There was a clear tactile sensory impairment in all
cases immediately after the lesion; the animals apparently did not notice when the affected hand and finger
tips came into contact with the cage floor or cage

walls. The sensory deficit was also evident when the
animals attempted to pick up objects in the cage with
the affected hand as they often groped at an object
and did not successfully grasp the object until the animal visually attended to it. This behavior was also

animals had to pick up very small food items. The
lesion volumes for each extirpated area are provided in
Table 2. A detailed description of the lesion site in each
experimental case is provided below.

arm/hand region of M1r (or the gryal, or “old” part of
area 4; Rathelot and Strick, 2009; Figs. 4, 6A, Table 2).
In the anterior bank of the central sulcus extensive
removal of M1c was noted, involving nearly one-half of
the anterior bank (or “new” part of area 4; Rathelot and
Strick, 2009; Figs. 4, 6A, Table 2). In the posterior
bank of the central sulcus, the upper one-fourth of S1r
was removed (Fig. 4). On the lateral parietal surface, all
of the arm/hand region of S1c was ablated, which
extended posteriorly to involve the rostral part of area
PE of the superior parietal lobule (Fig. 4).
Overall, the subcortical white matter lesion was limited to the region immediately below the gray matter
extirpation (Figs. 6A, Table 2). However, on the lateral
surface in the central region of the frontal lobe resection, a small part of the lesion spread inferiorly, forming
a vacated V-shape that appeared to part the uppermost
portions of the frontal occipital fasciculus (FOF) and
superior longitudinal fasciculus II (SLFII; nomenclature
according to Schmahmann and Pandya 2006). Much of
this subcortical lesion might have been a consequence
of lost subcortical fiber pathway that originally emerged
with the resected gray matter cortex. At its deepest
level, the vacated cortex corresponded to the horizontal
level containing the fundus of the cingulate sulcus.

area 4 (M1) and area 3a (S1) or area 4 and lateral premotor area 6DC. Cortical layers are identified by Roman numerals. The regions of
extirpated cortex are identified by M1c, M1r, S1r, and S1c. Note the extensive removal of M1c, M1r, S1c, and Sr in case SDM91. Scale
bar 5 2 mm.

Nissl-stained preparations, this cortex was found to be
disorganized, possibly by aspiration tip trauma during the
extirpation process. The lesion extended posteriorly onto
the gyral surface of the parietal lobe, fully removing S1c
and extending into the rostral part of area PE of the superior parietal lobule (Fig. 4).
As in case SDM87, white matter damage was found
in the central region of the frontal lobe lesion on the
lateral surface that spread inferiorly. This formed a

vacated V-shape that appeared between the uppermost
portions of the FOF and SLFII (Table 2). At its deepest
level, the vacated cortex corresponded to the horizontal
level containing the fundus of the cingulate sulcus.

(Figs. 4, 6C). For example, throughout the lesion site,
there was no evidence of cellular layers I–VI, with the
exception of a very small region near the shoulder/leg
border that only had layers I–III resected. The lateral
frontal lesion extended rostrally to involve a small portion of the inferior-posterior part of LPMCd, removing
layers I–III. This part of the lesion corresponded to
architectonic area 6DC. A small part of the posterior
region of architectonic area 6V of the ventrolateral premotor cortex (LPMCv) was fully resected. The M1 lesion
extended into the anterior bank of the central sulcus,
involving only the dorsal most part of M1c (Table 2).
Thus, a large portion of M1c was spared (Figs. 4, 6C).
Likewise, in the caudal bank of the central sulcus, most
of the cortex forming the rostral part of the arm/hand
part of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1r, or areas
3 and 1) was spared, with the exclusion of layers I–VI
forming the dorsal part of area 1, which was fully
resected (Fig. 4). From this location, the lesion

684

extended posteriorly, effectively removing all layers (I–
VI) of cortex forming the arm/hand part of caudal
somatosensory cortex (S1c, or the gyral part of S1 corresponding to areas 1 and 2). The parietal lobe lesion
extended into the superior parietal lobule, removing
layers I–VI of the rostral part of area PE (or area 5; Fig.
4) and only layers I–III in the posterior tip (1.5 mm) of
the excised cortical region.
In both the frontal and the parietal regions, there
was minimal white matter lesion damage that was confined to the location immediately below the extirpated
gray matter (Fig. 6C, Table 2). There was no vacated
region of white matter located below the gray matter
resection as found in monkeys SDM87 and SDM91.

cortex a small portion of LPMCd was ablated (i.e.,
layers I–VI were not found; Fig. 4), with the exception
of the anteriormost region (1 mm) of the extirpation,
where only layers I–III were removed. The M1r lesion
extended into the anterior bank of the central sulcus,
involving slightly more cortex on the anterior bank of
the central sulcus (i.e., M1c) than in case SDM81 (Fig.
4, Table 2). As with SDM81, much of the cortex lining
the fundus of the sulcus was spared, which extended
onto the caudal bank of the central sulcus (Fig. 6D).
However, slightly more cortex in the dorsal half of S1r
was removed, including all gray matter layers. From this
location, the lesion extended posteriorly, effectively
removing all of layers (I–VI) of cortex forming the arm/
hand part of S1c on the gyral convexity. The parietal
lobe lesion extended very slightly into the superior parietal lobule, removing layers I–VI of the rostralmost part
of area PE (Fig. 4).
As with SDM81, there was minimal white matter
lesion damage that was confined to the location immediately below the excised gray matter (Fig. 6D, Table 2).
There was also no evidence of a vacated region of white
matter located below the gray matter resection as was
found in monkeys SDM87 and SDM91.

Summary of lesion site analyses
In all monkeys, our histological analysis showed that
the cortical lesion was confined to the intended lateral
frontal motor cortex, adjacent primary somatosensory
cortex, and rostralmost part of the superior parietal
lobule. A significant component of gray matter on the
cortical surface was removed in the ablation cases,
with differing amounts of cortex extirpated along the
banks lining the depths of the central sulcus. The
amount of extirpated cortex lining the anterior part of
the central sulcus gradually increased, with SDM81 having the smallest percentage of extirpated M1c cortex
(30%), cases SDM83 and SDM87 having approximately

50% of M1c removed, and SDM91 having all of M1c
ablated (100%; Table 2). Likewise, the smallest percentage of extirpated S1r cortex was in case SDM81 (20%)
and the greatest amount in case SDM91 (80%) with
intermediate levels of S1r removal occurring in cases
SDM83 (34%) and SDM87 (24%; Table 2). In all cases
M1r and S1c were effectively removed, with the exception of a small part of M1r near the shoulder/leg transition region dorsally in case SDM81. In all cases there
was minimal subcortical white matter involvement limited to the region immediately below the cortical extirpation and without subcortical gray matter involvement
(i.e., basal ganglia and thalamus).

Neuroanatomical observations of the F2P2
lesion cases vs. the controls
The CSP from the arm representation of M2 was
examined in four F2P2 animals, and the estimated numbers of labeled boutons for each case within each lamina are provided in Table 6 (contralateral projection)
and Table 7 (ipsilateral projection). In the F2P2 lesion
cases, the terminal bouton estimate for the M2 contralateral CSP to the four quadrants of lamina IX is provided in Table 8.
The F2P2 lesion cases averaged approximately 75%
of the mean estimated number of boutons of control
cases for the M2 CSP in the contralateral spinal gray
matter of C5–T1. Two-way (groups - lesion/control;
regions - dorsal horn [laminae I–IV], intermediate zone
[laminae V–VII and RMB], ventral horn [laminae VIII–IX],
lamina X) repeated-measures ANOVA showed that the
number of boutons was lower in F2P2 lesion subjects
than in controls (Fig. 7; group main effect: F1,7 5 5.45,
P 5 0.052) and that the distribution of boutons among
spinal regions was altered by the lesion (Fig. 7; group x
region interaction effect: F3,21 5 5.03, P 5 0.009). Specifically, there were fewer boutons in the intermediate

zone in subjects with F2P2 lesions than in controls (Fig.
7B; P 5 0.009 on post hoc tests) but not in other
regions (Fig. 7B; P > 0.05). Further statistical analysis
of boutons within the intermediate zone laminae and
RMB showed that only lamina VII had fewer boutons in
F2P2 lesion monkeys than controls (Fig. 7; F3,21 5 3.75,
P 5 0.063; P 5 0.009 on post hoc test for lamina VII,
P > 0.98 for laminae V and VI and RMB). Analysis of
lamina IX boutons by quadrants showed that the F2P2
lesion subjects had significantly fewer boutons only in
the dorsal quadrants (Fig. 7C; group 3 quadrant interaction: F3,21 5 8.74, P 5 0.005, P < 0.05 on post hoc
tests comparing specific quadrants of controls and
lesion subjects). The neuroplastic response was limited
to the contralateral pathway; the estimated numbers of
labeled boutons in the ipsilateral M2 CSP was similar
for lesion and control cases (Fig. 7D; F1,7 5 0.007,
P 5 0.937).
On average M2 fibers in the contralateral lateral corticospinal tract at C5 and C8 were longer in controls
than in subjects with F2P2 lesions, but there were no

686

significant differences between the two groups
(F1,7 5 1.25, P 5 0.3) and no group-by-segmental level
(C5, C8) interaction effect (F1,7 5 0.16, P 5 0.7). In contrast, the lesion cases had shorter M2 terminal fibers
than controls in contralateral spinal gray matter. Specifically, within the spinal gray matter at segmental levels
C5 and C8, the distribution of M2 terminal fiber lengths
within the medial and lateral regions of lamina VII and
the dorsal regions of lamina IX differed between F2P2
lesioned monkeys and controls (group 3 segment 3
lamina region effects: F3,21 5 7.61, P 5 0.001). Post
hoc tests showed that these differences were confined
to the lateral and medial regions of lamina VII at C5, in
which F2P2 lesioned monkeys had shorter fibers than
controls (P < 0.05). Fiber lengths were similar for lamina VII medial and lateral regions at C8 and for lamina
IX dorsolateral and dorsomedial regions at C5 and C8
(P > 0.93).

Correlation of neuroanatomical and
behavioral observations
There were varying levels of recovery of reaching
and grasp/manipulation of the food targets on the
mDB and mMAP tasks among the four lesion cases.
Three cases (SDM81, 283, 287) showed good recovery of performance scores (Fig. 8A,B) and postlesion/
prelesion manipulation skill ratios (Fig. 9A,B; manipulation skill ratios between approximately 0.4 and 1.2) in
the mDB and mMAP tasks (see, e.g., Figs. 8, 9), comparable to recovery of manipulation skill that we have
reported previously for most monkeys with M1 1 LPMC
lesions (Darling et al. 2009). However, one case
(SDM91) showed very poor recovery. Specifically,
SDM91 had five successful acquisitions in a single
postlesion test for only well E of the mDB task
(actually a shallow dimple in the Plexiglas plate to hold
the pellet) and never on the easiest mMAP task
(grasping a carrot chip from a flat surface). There were

Figure 8. A shows mean pre- and postlesion total (black), reach (blue), and manipulation (red) performance scores (61 SD) for the mDB

and were also more variable. B shows mean pre- and postlesion performance scores in the mMAP curved rod task by SDM81.

Figure 9. A and B show relationships between recovery of manipulation skill (ratio of best postlesion skill ratio to skill of last five prelesion

plotted points at bottom left (i.e., poorest recovery) in A and B. Linear correlation coefficients for statistically significant relationships

also some successful postlesion acquisitions of the
small food pellet used in the mDB task wells from
wells B, C, and D and of the carrot chip in the mMAP
flat surface task, but not in the mMAP straight rod or
curved rod tasks. Thus, some recovery clearly

occurred, but learned nonuse developed in SDM91
beginning after postlesion week 8, because there were
no further attempts to retrieve the food targets with
the contralesional hand on the mDB or mMAP tasks
(see, e.g., Fig. 8B).

lesion. Note that the data for SDM91 (longest duration until first attempt and success) are indicated at top left of each graph. Linear correlation coefficients for statistically significant relationships between postlesion duration until first attempt and success in the mDB and
mMAP tasks and numbers of laminae VII and IX boutons are also shown.

There was evidence that the postlesion duration until
behavioral attempts and successes were made correlated
with the remaining numbers of boutons from M2 in laminae containing interneurons and motor neurons. Specifically there were significant negative correlations of the
ratios of lamina VII and IX boutons in lesion cases to average numbers of boutons in controls with postlesion duration to first attempt and first success in the mDB and/or
the easiest mMAP (flat surface) tasks. In the mDB task,
the postlesion duration until the first attempt on any well
was strongly negatively correlated with the lamina VII
bouton ratio (Fig. 10A; r 5 –0.94, P 5 0.032). In the easiest (flat surface) mMAP task, there was a significant negative correlation of the lamina IX bouton ratio with
postlesion duration until first attempt (Fig. 10B; r 5 –
0.95, P 5 0.027) and also evidence of a correlation with
postlesion duration until the first success on this task
(Fig. 10C, r 5 –0.83, P 5 0.086).
Recovery of fine motor function varied substantially
among the four lesion cases and was also closely
related to the number of M2 CSP boutons remaining in
laminae VII and IX in individual lesion cases. The ratio
of the number of labeled lamina IX boutons in lesion
cases to the average number of labeled lamina IX boutons in controls was highly positively correlated with
postlesion recovery of manipulation skill (measured as
the ratio of postlesion skill to skill of the last five prelesion tests and skill of the best five consecutive prelesion tests; Fig. 9A; r 5 0.88, 0.99, respectively,
P < 0.003). Similarly, recovery of manipulation skill in
the mMAP curved rod task was positively correlated
with the ratio of labeled boutons in lamina VII of lesion

688

cases to the average number of labeled lamina VII boutons in controls (Fig. 9B; r 5 0.95, P 5 0.027).

DISCUSSION
Lateral frontoparietal damage is common following
stroke because the middle cerebral artery (MCA) supplies this part of the cortical mantle (Tatu et al., 1998)
and is the most commonly affected vessel in stroke
(see, e.g., Ameriso and Sahi, 1997; Castillo and Bogousslavsky, 1997; Pessin, 1997; Carrera et al., 2007;
Gonzalez Delgado and Bogousslavsky, 2012). Our findings reveal that the collective loss of the lateral frontal
somatomotor cortex and lateral parietal somatosensory
cortex (F2P2 lesion) not only impedes a favorable compensatory neuroplastic response from the spared M2
CSP but results in a substantial loss of M2 corticospinal
terminal boutons and terminal fibers compared with
controls (Fig. 11). This response is in striking contrast
to our previous findings after isolated lateral frontal
somatomotor cortex injury (F2 lesion) showing that the
CSP from M2 substantially increases in terms of the
number of terminal boutons and terminal fiber lengths
in laminae VII and IX at spinal levels C5–T1 compared
with controls (Fig. 11; McNeal et al., 2010). We did not
find any statistical differences between corticospinal
fiber lengths in the lateral corticospinal tract (LCST) in
the F2P2 lesion cases vs. the controls. This suggests
that the breakdown of the intact M2 corticospinal pathway occurred at the putative synaptic level within the
confines of the spinal gray matter, at least with respect
to the parameters investigated in our study, and this

Vulnerability of spared frontal corticospinal projections

Figure 11. Model of the effects of lateral cortical lesions on M2 CSP to spinal cord laminae of C5–T1 in controls and monkeys with
F2P2 lesions and F2 lesions. In the present study we found substantial reductions in the total number of terminal labeled boutons of
the supplementary motor cortex (M2) corticospinal projection (CSP) in lamina VII and IX at spinal levels C5–T1 following removal of the
arm/hand region of the lateral frontal somatomotor cortex (M1 1 LPMC) and removal of the arm/hand region of the lateral parietal
somatosensory cortex (S1 1 rostral part of area 5/PE; far left, F2P2 lesion) compared with controls (middle of figure). In our previous
study, we found that isolated removal of the arm/hand region of the lateral frontal somatomotor cortex (M1 1 LPMC) alone (far right,
F2 lesion) results in substantial increases in contralateral terminal labeling of the M2 CSP in laminae VII and IX compared with controls
(McNeal et al., 2010). Thus, we demonstrate in the present study that the added effect of adjacent parietal cortex injury to the frontal
motor lesion not only impedes a favorable compensatory neuroplastic response but results in a substantial loss of M2 CSP terminal
boutons. Clinically, our findings suggest that localized lateral peri-Rolandic cortical injury in stroke patients, which is very common, may
undermine the structural and functional integrity of intact CSP located at remote sites from the lesion site. Note: The relative intensity
of the projection to spinal cord laminae is indicated by line thickness and arrow size. Denser terminal projections are represented by

arrowheads.

condition persists for 6–12 months after lateral frontoparietal injury. What our data does not reveal is whether
this long-term loss of corticospinal input represents a
gradual decline or, conversely, a gradual recovery of input
following a potentially massive loss of M2 corticospinal
input in the acute and subacute phases following lateral
frontoparietal injury. Indeed, application of the current
experimental design for cases terminated at earlier postinjury time intervals (1 and 3 months after injury) will be
required to address these important issues.

Effects of sensory denervation/deprivation
on motor system output
It is well beyond the scope of this research article to
summarize the literature concerning the effects of
sensory denervation on movement. However, some discussion is appropriate in the context of our experimental findings following partial destruction of S1. It has
long been noted in nonhuman primates that section of
the dorsal roots that subserve upper limb sensory
impulses has devastating effects on motor function of

the upper limb. Mott and Sherrington (1895) found that
sectioning the dorsal roots in monkeys produced more
severe and longer lasting paralysis than motor cortex
resection. Similarly, more recent studies in monkeys
have shown cervical dorsal rhizotomy that completely
abolishes afferents to a subset of the digits is associated with poor recovery of grasping such that only digits that were incompletely deafferented were used to
grasp objects (Darian-Smith and Ciferri, 2005; DarianSmith, 2009). After sectioning of dorsal roots with
receptive fields on the first three digits, recovery on a
grasp retrieval task was accompanied by M1 corticospinal sprouting in the dorsal horn, indicating an adaptive
and possibly supportive role for spared M1 CSP in the
recovery process (Darian-Smith et al., 2013). However,
the S1 CSP retracted, which is similar to the reduction
of spared M2 CSP observed in the present study following lateral frontoparietal injury. Taken together, the findings of Darian-Smith and colleagues indicate that the
loss of peripheral sensory afferent input to S1 as a
result of dorsal rhizotomy results in a retraction of the
S1 CSP in the affected dorsal horn and increase in the
M1 CSP in the affected dorsal horn. However, it is
unclear whether this sensory deprivation results in a
decrease in the M1 CSP in the intermediate and anterior spinal gray matter regions as would be predicted
from our findings.
Dorsal column injury, which disrupts the delivery of
tactile and proprioceptive sensation information to S1,
has devastating effects on fractionated finger movements (Beck, 1976; Eidelberg et al., 1976; Vierck,
1978; Cooper et al., 1993). Most of the investigative
work examining the CNS adaptations that accompany
dorsal column lesions has focused on adaptive reorganization at the level of the cuneate nucleus, sensory thalamus, and primary somatosensory cortex (for review
see Qi et al., 2014). Much like dorsal root lesions, reactivation and reorganization of S1 that correlates with
behavioral motor recovery appears to depend on preserved subcomponents of the ascending sensory pathways. Some recovery may occur following complete
dorsal column lesions through preserved ascending
second-order neuron axons arising from the dorsal horn
neurons and spared ascending sensory fibers that travel
in the anterior and lateral funiculi (for review see Qi
et al., 2014). Notably, recovery of manual dexterity has
been correlated with reactivation of lost components of
the ascending somatosensory relay nuclei through local
sprouting mechanisms from intact sensory fiber systems, including at the level of S1. It seems logical to
assume that the immediate deficits in manual dexterity
may be due primarily to the loss of somatosensory
input to guide appropriate motor output, but it remains

unclear whether this condition has an acute or longterm detrimental effect on what appears to be an otherwise intact frontal motor neural network. Indeed,
because the literature indicates that fractionated movements appear to be highly susceptible to impairments
after dorsal column lesions, it is possible that this sensory loss may have a negative impact on intact CSP
from the frontal cortex to lamina IX, which contains
motoneurons innervating the distal upper extremity
musculature. Supporting this possibility is recent work
showing that increased current levels are required to
evoke movements from M1 following long-term dorsal
column lesions (Kambi et al., 2011).
It is clear that our parietal lobe lesions did not fully
disrupt the arm/hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex with the possible exception of SDM91
(extensive damage to S1r and S1c; Fig. 4, Table 2) and
that alternate, indirect routes of ascending somatosensory input (e.g., from the cuneate nucleus as well as
from cerebellum which receives cutaneous/proprioceptive inputs from spinocerebellar tracts) were likely to
reach and influence M2. However, our results show
that partial S1r and substantial S1c damage of the lateral parietal cortex, along with lateral frontal motor cortex injury, completely changes the recovery dynamics/
mechanisms of spared medial motor cortex CSP output
to one that is maladaptive, blocking a favorable recovery mechanism that we have previously shown for the
M2 CSP response following lateral frontal motor cortex
injury alone (McNeal et al., 2010). Collectively, this
work strongly suggests a critical trophic influence for
intact S1 on a remote component of the frontal motor
cortical network (i.e., M2) that does not receive direct
S1 cortical afferents, with the exception of a small projection from the posterior part of area 2 (Luppino et al.,
1993; Morecraft et al., 2012). Indeed, it will be of great
interest to study the effects of isolated parietal cortex
injury on spared frontomotor CSP to determine the
nature of trophic input from different parietal lobe
regions on the maintenance and integrity of lateral and
medial frontomotor corticospinal pathways.
It is possible that a trophic influence of parietal cortex neurons on motor cortex is mediated through
release of nerve growth factors from parietal cortex
affecting distant cortical and subcortical sites or by
parietal neural activity influencing long-term potentiation in cortical and subcortical areas receiving parietal
inputs. There is evidence that cortical activation with
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of
the brain enhances production of mRNA for brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) specifically in parietal cortex, with some increase also in hippocampus and
piriform cortex, of rats (Hausmann et al., 2000; Muller

The Journal of Comparative Neurology | Research in Systems Neuroscience

Vulnerability of spared frontal corticospinal projections

et al., 2000). Kindling seizures induced by electrical
stimulation of the ventral hippocampus in rats also
increase production of mRNA for BDNF in parietal cortex (Ernfors et al., 1991; Kokaia et al., 1996). Normal
activation of parietal cortex by stimulation of peripheral
sensory receptors may also increase production and
release of BDNF from parietal lobe, which may enter
the cerebrospinal fluid and help maintain neural tissue
in various areas of the CNS, including motor areas.
There is also evidence that BDNF is an anterograde
neurotrophic factor transported and released by axons
originating from subcortical areas and parietal lobe to
cause neurotrophic responses in specific targets (Fawcett et al., 1998; Kokaia et al., 1998). Damage to parietal lobe would presumably reduce this production and
release of BDNF, which may decrease its availability in
motor areas for maintenance of healthy neural tissue,
including connections to spinal motor neurons and
interneurons from intact motor areas. Action potentials
in parietal cortex neurons that normally occur during
voluntary limb motions may help to maintain synaptic
connections among parietal and motor areas, as suggested from studies of paired associative stimulation
and functional connectivity between posterior parietal
cortex and motor cortex (Veniero et al. 2013). Removal
of parietal cortex and the subsequent loss of connections to motor areas may decrease health of neural tissues in those areas, perhaps leading to loss of output
connections as we have observed for the M2 CSP.

Motor recovery considerations
Given the previously described effects of dorsal root
and dorsal column lesions on upper limb movements,
we were surprised that recovery of dexterous hand/
digit movements was good in three of the four F2P2
lesion cases (see, e.g., Fig. 8A, B). Indeed, SDM81,
SDM83, and SDM87 showed recovery of fine movement
control that was similar to that of monkeys with lesions
limited to frontal motor areas (Darling et al. 2009). Only
SDM91 showed very poor long-term recovery (Figs. 8–
10), which probably was due to the more extensive
damage to both caudal M1 and rostral S1 than in the
other F2P2 cases reported here (Fig. 4, Table 2). However, SDM91 did show recovery of precision grasping of
small food pellets at 6 and 7 weeks postlesion on the
mDB task (unpublished observations) before learned
nonuse set in but never used the contralesional hand
again in either task. Degeneration of the M2 CSP might
have occurred over several weeks after the lesion and
may have contributed to the apparent arrest of motor
recovery and onset of learned nonuse. Identification of
therapies that can prevent deterioration of the CSP
from spared frontal motor areas after large parietal

lobe lesions may be important in generating good motor
recovery and preventing learned nonuse of the contralesional limb, especially in humans, who rely extensively
on the CSP to perform individuated fractionated digit
movements (Porter and Lemon, 1993; Schieber, 2007;
Lemon, 2008).
The positive fine motor recovery of three of the four
cases (SDM81, SDM83, and SDM87) suggests that
spared subcortical and/or cortical motor areas had
access to upper limb somatosensory inputs despite the
lesion to S1. Sparing of a large portion of S1r in the
posterior bank of the central sulcus in these three
cases would have allowed some somatosensory input
from the upper limb to project to spared frontal motor
areas (including the spared part of M1c located in the
depths of the central sulcus) and is also consistent
with the notable recovery reported when some cervical
dorsal roots are spared in studies of effects of dorsal
rhizotomy (Mott and Sherrington, 1895; Darian-Smith
and Ciferri, 2005). However, the three cases with good
recovery usually confirmed grasp of the food with vision
during postlesion testing, whereas during prelesion testing the tasks were often performed without vision as
the monkey would watch the experimenter rather than
view the hand during these tasks. Such pre- and postlesion behaviors during fine motor tasks have been
reported for monkeys experiencing dorsal column
lesions (see, e.g., Qi et al., 2014) and postcentral cortical ablation (Kennard and Kessler, 1940; Peele, 1944).
There was evidence that recovery rate and quality
depended on numbers of remaining M2 CSP boutons in
laminae VII and IX of C5–T1 (Figs. 9A,B, 10). That is,
there were inverse relationships between postlesion
duration until first attempt and first success with the
contralesional hand in the mDB and mMAP tasks with
estimated numbers of boutons in laminae VII and IX relative to numbers of boutons in controls (Fig. 10). Furthermore, there were positive relationships of numbers
of laminae VII and IX boutons relative to controls with
recovery of manipulation skill in the mDB and mMAP
tasks (Fig. 9A,B). These relationships are consistent
with our previous work showing correlations of motor
function recovery following an F2 lesion with increased
numbers of M2 CSP boutons in these laminae (McNeal
et al., 2010). However, a large increase in M2 CSP boutons in laminae VII and IX following a subtotal F2P2
lesion in the nonhuman primate model is apparently not
required for good recovery, because we observed significant loss of M2 CSP boutons in the present work. It is
important to note that we were able to demonstrate a
contributing role in motor recovery for the increased
CSP from M2 following isolated lateral frontal motor
injury (McNeal et al., 2010). Specifically, after motor

recovery from the lateral frontomotor (F2) lesion, subsequent destruction of M2 with ibotenic acid reinstated
the initial deficits in fine movements of the hand (see
SDM58, Fig. 11 of McNeal et al., 2010). It is possible
in the three F2P2 lesion cases that showed good recovery in the current study that other cortical and subcortical motor areas were able to compensate for the
apparent degeneration of the M2 CSP and reestablish
innervation of spinal interneurons and possibly motor
neurons controlling arm/hand/digit muscles. Likely
candidates include spared parts of the M1c arm/hand
area located in the depths of the central sulcus as previously mentioned, the cingulate motor areas and subcortical motor structures that exert influence directly
on spinal neurons (i.e., red nucleus, reticular formation).
Indeed, recent work with nonlesioned monkeys has
shown that the reticulospinal projection has excitatory
disynaptic and monosynaptic connections with motor
neurons innervating upper limb muscles, including the
intrinsic hand muscles (Riddle et al., 2009). The correlation analyses discussed above suggest that the remaining small numbers of M2 CSP boutons in laminae VII
and IX also contributed to recovery of dexterity in
SDM81, SDM83, and SDM87, perhaps because of
maintenance of some direct corticomotoneuronal projections (Table 8).

Clinical considerations
Among the many postulated brain areas contributing
to motor recovery following brain injury, the role of
spared CSP areas is among the most promising
because it represents highly accessible targets for noninvasive therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, spared
CSP represents the only direct linkage between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord. Thus, therapeutic
interventions directed toward this system may have the
most immediate and significant impact on the motor
recovery process, particularly for restored hand movements. However, findings from the current study suggest that what may appear to be spared CSP fields
following frontoparietal cortical injury might in fact be
highly vulnerable to long-term deterioration and over
time become part of an “extended” cortical lesion.
Indeed, our findings suggest that the loss of critical
parietal somatosensory input on spared components of
the frontal motor system may contribute significantly to
the breakdown of intact CSP and may subsequently
contribute to the failure to recover fine sensorimotor
control of dexterous hand/digit movements. Specifically, the findings from the current study suggest that
the medial frontal motor system, which at the cortical
level is likely to be spared in at least 97% of stroke victims because it is supplied by the anterior cerebral

692

artery (ACA; Bogousslavsky and Regil, 1990; Kazui
et al., 1993; Kumral et al., 2002; Carrera et al., 2007),
may be particularly vulnerable to the eventual loss of
descending influence on spinal interneurons and motoneurons following common MCA infarctions that compromise the peri-Rolandic region. The importance of
maintaining the integrity of the CSP from M2 is underscored by the fact that it represents the second largest
CSP, second only to M1 (Dum and Strick, 1991; Galea
and Darian-Smith, 1994), and is the only cortical area
other than M1 known to give rise to direct corticomotoneuronal projections supplying muscles acting on the
wrist and hand (Maier et al., 2002; Boudrias et al.,
2006, 2010a,b). It is important to note that it is unclear
whether the M2 CSP vulnerability identified in the present report is due to the combined loss of lateral M1
and S1 or whether parietal lobe injury alone is enough
to render it susceptible to long-term degeneration in
the absence of therapeutic intervention. It is also possible that diaschisis, or adverse neurophysiological
changes that occur at remote sites from the brain
lesion, and affiliated connectional network, played a
role in the deterioration of the M2 CSP (for review see
Carrera and Tononi, 2014). However, if this were the
case, we likely would have not found the favorable neuroplastic response for the M2 CSP following our focal
lateral frontal lobe injury experiments (McNeal et al.,
2010). Indeed, understanding the status of spared CSP
following subtotal cortical injury will be critical to designing targeted interventions that can not only maintain
their integrity following injury but also include them in
the recovery process during rehabilitative intervention.

Technical considerations
In the current study design, a lower volume (0.9 ml)
of FD was injected into the central region of the arm
representation of M2 in three of the four F2P2 lesion
cases compared with a greater volume (1.2 ml) in the
controls (Table 1). Thus, it is possible that this volume
difference accounts for the lower number of labeled
boutons estimated in the three F2P2 lesion cases vs.
the control experiments. Indeed, our initial study design
hypothesized that the much larger F2P2 lesion, compared with the smaller F2 lesion, would potentially
result in much greater CSP neuroplastic response (e.g.,
more labeled terminal boutons) than was found in our
previous F2 lesion experiments. We therefore opted to
initiate the F2P2 experiments by injecting the same
tracer volume as we injected in the F2 cases (0.9 ml;
McNeal et al., 2010). Several observations point to the
conclusion that the lower number of labeled boutons
found in all the F2P2 experimental cases vs. the controls is truly reflective not only of inhibited neuroplastic

The Journal of Comparative Neurology | Research in Systems Neuroscience

Vulnerability of spared frontal corticospinal projections

response but also of a true reduction, or deterioration
of the spared M2 CSP following parietal lobe inclusion
in our lateral frontomotor lesion model. First, our F2P2
lesion case SDM91 received 1.2 ml of FD and resulted
in the lowest number of labeled CSP boutons in all
cases presented in this article. Second, we have previously demonstrated in four monkey experiments with
an F2 lesion that a total FD injection volume of 0.9 ml
is more than enough tracer volume to not only
adequately label terminal boutons throughout spinal levels C5–T1 but label a far greater number of terminal
boutons (i.e., two to three times) vs. all five of our M2
control cases (see Tables 5 and 7 in McNeal et al.,
2010). For instance, our F2 lesion cases SDM45 and
SDM70 received 0.9 ml of FD tracer, and each gave
rise to greater than 200,000 labeled terminal boutons
compared with an average control value of 75,854
labeled boutons (McNeal et al., 2010). The lack of significant changes in the ipsilateral CSP would also seem
to rule out differences attributable to different injection
volumes associated with these large injection sites.
Other considerations would also support a compatible
tracer transport environment when assessing the estimated volumes of the injection site core and halo
(Table 1). The range of halos (which included the core
volume) for the controls was 51.6–85.9 mm3, whereas
the range for the F2P2 cases was 47.8–119.7 mm3.
Similarly, the range of the injection site cores for the
controls was 14.7–38.7 mm3 and for the F2P2 lesion
cases 15.5–36.6 mm3. Thus, in each set of experimental animals, there were representative cases with similar injection site characteristics in terms of tracer core
density and peripheral spread (i.e., halo). Indeed, F2P2
case SDM 91 had the largest halo (119.7 mm3) and
second largest core value (36.6 mm3) and the fewest
labeled boutons, suggesting that the total number of
labeled boutons was not critically dependent on the
size of the injection site halo/core or the total volume
(0.9–1.2 ml) injected. It is notable that in all four F2P2
cases we were able to find solidly filled terminal axons
and boutons throughout C5–T1 (Fig. 2) and at levels T2
and T3, which were not part of this investigation.
Indeed, these lower levels (T2 and T3) were processed
to ensure that we had a full set of tissue sections
through T1 and to evaluate the quality of tracer transport to spinal levels below the cervical enlargement.
Finally, our histological analysis demonstrated that a
dense, solid core region was present in the FD injection
site in all four F2P2 lesion cases (Fig. 1), showing
that an extensive and concentrated amount of tracer
was still available for active transport 33–34 days after
the administration of FD into the arm/hand region
of M2.

It is important to note that three of the four study
subjects were male in the previous report of increased
M2 CSP boutons after M1 1 LPMC lesions (McNeal
et al., 2010), but in the present report of decreased M2
CSP boutons all subjects were female. Moreover, the
lone female (SDM48) of the previous study had fewer
M2 CSP boutons after the M1 1 LPMC lesion than two
of the three male monkeys (see Table 5 in McNeal
et al., 2010). Thus, gender differences in capacity for
intraspinal sprouting of axons and boutons after cortical
lesions may partially account for the different results.
Unfortunately, we could not locate any studies of gender differences in axonal sprouting within the spinal
cord after lesions to cerebral cortex. However, there
are investigations of sex differences in axonal sprouting
within hippocampus following lesions to the medial septal nucleus or fimbria/fornix showing that females
exhibit much greater axonal sprouting than males (see,
e.g., Loy and Milner, 1980). Moreover, other research
shows that estrogen stimulates axonal sprouting of the
nucleus retroambiguus–spinal pathway in female mice,
cats, and rhesus monkeys (Van der Horst and Holstege,
1998; Vanderhorst et al., 2002; Vanderhorst, 2005) and
that axonal sprouting after cutting of peripheral nerves
is greater in females than in males (Kovacic et al.,
2003). Given these findings, it seems unlikely that the
reduced numbers of M2 CSP boutons after F2P2
lesions observed in the current study can be attributed
to less capacity for axonal sprouting in females than in
males. Future study of gender differences in compensatory axonal sprouting responses following cortical brain
lesions in the monkey model is warranted.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have found that concomitant removal of the periRolandic frontal and parietal arm/hand region blocks a
favorable M2 corticospinal neuroplastic response but
also results in a devastating loss of CSP from spared
ipsilesional M2 at chronic stages of spontaneous recovery (Fig. 11). These findings suggest that spared frontal
CSP that are secluded from the grossly identifiable lateral frontoparietal lesion site are in fact vulnerable and,
over time, eventually become part of the lesion. It is
important to note that our experimental animals were
allowed to move freely in their cage over a 6- and 12month time period and to use either hand during their
activities of daily living (including feeding, climbing, and
playing with large toys for environmental enrichment).
Despite such extensive motor activity over an extended
time frame, the CSP from M2 still deteriorated, indicating that some form of therapeutic intervention will be
required to reinstate a positive compensatory response

for the spared M2 projection, as we have found following spontaneous recovery following isolated resection of
M1 and LPMC alone (McNeal et al., 2010). Clinically,
our findings suggest it is possible that the common
occurrence of lateral frontoparietal cortical injury in
stroke patients may also undermine the structural
integrity and functional operations of intact CSP located
at remote sites from the lesion and, much like our
experimental rhesus monkey model, may lead to the
gradual deterioration of intact CSP neurons in the
absence of effective therapeutic intervention. It is also
possible that the involvement of parietal lobe injury,
which is the most frequently damaged part of the cortical mantle in stroke patients (Yoo et al., 1998), may
undermine the motor recovery process in humans and
might be an overlooked factor that contributes to the
poor motor recovery outcomes that often accompany
superficial MCA stroke.
