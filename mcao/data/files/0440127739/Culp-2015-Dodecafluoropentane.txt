Abstract Dodecafluoropentane emulsion (DDFPe)
nanodroplets are exceptional oxygen transporters and can protect ischemic brain in stroke models 24 h without reperfusion.
Current stroke therapy usually fails to reach patients because
of delays following stroke onset. We tested using DDFPe to
extend the time window for tissue plasminogen activator
(tPA). Longer treatment windows will allow more patients
more complete stroke recovery. We test DDFPe to safely extend the time window for tPA thrombolysis to 9 h after stroke.
With IACUC approval, randomized New Zealand white rabbits (3.4–4.7 kg, n=30) received angiography and 4-mm
blood clot in the internal carotid artery for flow-directed middle cerebral artery occlusion. Seven failed and were discarded.
Groups were IV tPA (n=11), DDFPe + tPA (n=7), and no
therapy controls (n=5). DDFPe (0.3 ml/kg, 2 % emulsion)
IV dosing began at 1 h and continued at 90 min intervals for
6 doses in one test group; the other received saline injections.
Both got standard IV tPA (0.9 mg/kg) therapy starting 9 h post
stroke. At 24 h, neurological assessment scores (NAS, 0–18)
were determined. Following brain removal percent stroke

volume (%SV) was measured. Outcomes were compared with
Kruskal-Wallis analysis. For NAS, DDFPe + tPA was improved overall, p=0.0015, and vs. tPA alone, p=0.0052. For
%SV, DDFPe + tPA was improved overall, p=0.0003 and vs.
tPA alone, p=0.0018. NAS controls and tPA alone were not
different but %SV was, p=0.0078. With delayed reperfusion,
DDFPe + tPA was more effective than tPA alone in preserving
functioning brain after stroke. DDFPe significantly extends
the time window for tPA therapy.

Introduction
Delay is the most common factor in obstructing delivery of
thrombolysis to acute stroke patients. Delays in recognition,
delays in calling for help, delays in first responder arrival,
triage, and transportation, and delays in door to needle time
on arrival at the hospital all steadily accumulate. These delays
routinely add up to more than the FDA-approved 3 h between
stroke onset and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV
tPA) administration, and usually to more than the 4.5 h, the
rest of the scientific world allows to start thrombolysis. Due to
this and other contraindications, fewer than 5.2 % of acute
stroke patients now actually qualify and receive IV tPA therapy [1].
Many clinical efforts have focused on accelerating tPA delivery, and some real progress has been made. Still, a neuroprotective technique to save brain until reperfusion can actually be accomplished remains an elusive goal. Only this year,
the Field Administration of Stroke Therapy—Magnesium
Phase 3 Clinical Trial (FAST-MAG) of acute strokes showed
a 97 % success rate in delivering IV drugs to acute stroke

980

patients by an emergency medical technician (EMT) in the first
2 h after stroke onset. Over 73 % received IV magnesium
sulfate in the first BGolden Hour^ when recovery is most
achievable [2]. This field administration demonstrates success
in rapid EMT arrival, rapid field diagnosis, and injection of IV
drug, however, the presumptive neuroprotective drug failed to
provide real neuroprotection. Applying this approach to all
strokes is difficult, but it is estimated that 35 % of all acute
stroke patients could be treated by pre-hospital therapy within
2 h of onset, and up to 25 % could be treated within 1 h of onset
(personal communication, Jeffrey Saver, MD, UCLA). This
corresponds to a projection of almost 200,000 patients receiving IV neuroprotection within the first hour and 275,000 within
the first 2 h in the USA each year. Dodecafluoropentane emulsion (DDFPe), an oxygen-transporting perfluorocarbon given
IV, provides neuroprotection equally well given at 1 or 2 or
even 3-h delay after ischemic onset in rabbits [3, 4]. Even
though human dose and timing is not yet defined and actual
human application in strokes remains uncertain, it could potentially benefit a very large number of patients.
In this study we tested DDFPe as a IV neuroprotective drug
in a rabbit embolic ischemic stroke model which closely parallels the usual human clinical stroke situation. The IV DDFPe
was started at 1 h after onset of embolic ischemia like the
majority of patients in the FAST-MAG trial. Thrombolysis
of the embolic clot was delayed until 9 h after embolization,
three times the FDA-approved 3 h time limit. Then, at 9 h,
thrombolysis was begun with standard IV tPA therapy. The
results at 24 h were evaluated.

Methods
All procedures were approved of by the University’s
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. This rabbit
angiographic embolic stroke model is well proven in our laboratory with advantages of scale over smaller animals, especially for catheter delivery of clots. The published experience
showing its reliability and consistency of reperfusion with IV
tPA, even with the small number of animals in this study, is a
strength [5.6].
Animals Randomized New Zealand male or female rabbits
3.4 to 4.7 kg/bw (Harlan Labs) n=30 had a stroke induced
with aged blood clot according to the rabbit embolic stroke
procedure [5, 6]. Briefly, following sedation with intramuscular injection of ketamine of 30 mg/kg (Ketaset; Fort Dodge;
Fort Dodge, IA) and xylazine of 5 mg/kg (AnaSed; Lloyd
Laboratories; Shenandoah, IA) and 2 % isoflurane anesthesia
maintenance (Novaplus; Hospira Inc.; Lake Forrest, IL); a
modified 65-cm angled-tip 3 F catheter (SlipCath; Cook
Inc.; Bloomington, IN) was placed in the femoral artery, and

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:979–984

the internal carotid artery (ICA) selected for angiography and
clot embolization.
Aged Clot Production Aged clot was made using donor rabbit blood and allowed to clot at 37 °C for 6 h followed with
3 days at 4 °C in 1.5 mm glass tubing. The clot was then cut
into 4 mm lengths for use [5, 6].
Angiography A pre-stroke sub-selective magnified angiogram was made for comparison to post-embolization site identification of arterial occlusion using a C-arm DSA machine
(OEC 9800; GE Healthcare; Salt Lake City, UT).
Embolization with the 4-mm clot flushed into the ICA is flow
directed into the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and/or the
anterior cerebral artery (ACA) for standard infarcts. Animals
with non-standard occlusions, usually posterior circulation occlusions or cerebrovascular spasm, were discarded and not
included in the study. The catheter was then removed and
the femoral artery ligated.
Treatment Groups Before angiography, rabbits were randomized into one of three treatment groups: (i) control
[CON] (saline only), (ii) 0.9 mg/kg tPA [tPA], or (iii) 0.3 ml/
kg DDFPe+0.9 mg/kg tPA [D + tPA]. Rabbits with combinations of MCA and/or ACA occlusions were placed in the
recovery unit.
DDFPe Animals received via ear vein IV treatment of saline
or 0.3 ml/kg DDFPe beginning 1 h following embolization
and additional doses at 90 min intervals (6 doses total). The
administration of 0.3 ml/kg DDFPe was given using a slow
push intravenous dose of a 2 % w/v DDFPe (NuvOx Pharma;
Tucson, AZ). Following the last DDFPe dose at hour nine,
tPA lytic therapy began.
tPA For rabbits receiving tPA, the standard dose of IV tPA
(Cathflo Activase; Genetech; South San Francisco, CA) was
0.9 mg/kg, given as a bolus of 10 % of the dose and the remainder of the doses at 5 min intervals over 1 h. The rabbit dose used
here (0.9 mg/kg) corresponds to the classic paper of Zivin et al.
[7] and was found to be efficacious in previous studies [6, 8].
Histopathology At 24 h following embolization, the animals
were evaluated for neurological assessment scores (NAS), and
the brains were removed for quantification of core cerebral
infarction stroke. The harvested brains were chilled in saline
and sectioned coronally in 4.0 mm intervals using a brain
mold (RBM-7000C; ASI Instruments Inc.; Warren, MI).
Brain size and digitally captured images of stained coronal
sections using a 1 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) were measured using ImageJ 1.48v (National
Institutes of Health, USA) [3–6, 8]. Areas of core cerebral
infarction were measured by a technician blinded to the

Mol Neurobiol (2015) 52:979–984

981

treatment groups. Blinding of the TTC scoring was effected
by randomizing the blinded image sets and having only one
person doing a complete scoring of all these cases 2 months
after the animal portion of the study. The percent of infarct
was calculated as a percent of the whole brain. The incidence
of hemorrhage and location were noted.
Neurological Assessment Scores Just before sacrifice at
24 h, the rabbits had a complete neurological assessment score
(NAS) performed [9, 10]. This score of neurological function
was expanded with additional behavior scores and ranged
from 0 to 18 (Table 1). Blinding of the NAS scoring was not
complete. However, all NAS values were a consensus reached
by two independent observers after independent evaluations.
Statistics Median percent infarct volume and median NAS
scores are reported for each group. The Kruskal-Wallis procedure, which is the nonparametric analog of one-way ANOVA,
was used to compare percent infarct volume and NAS scores
among the three treatment groups using an alpha-level of 0.05
to determine statistical significance. If this test was significant
for a specific outcome (e.g., percent stroke volume or NAS),
then pre-specified pairwise comparisons of CON vs. tPA and
tPA vs. D + tPA were made using Bonferroni-adjusted alphalevels of 0.025 to determine significance. The percentages of
hemorrhage and of infarct observed in posterior brain tissue
areas were compared among treatment groups using exact
contingency table methods.

Results
Thirty rabbits were randomized and had angiography and embolization with 4-mm aged clot. Six had posterior circulation
occlusions and 1 had a severe vasospasm of the ICA and were
excluded. Rabbits fell into one of three treatment groups: (i)

CON n=5, (ii) tPA n=11, or (iii) D + tPA n=7. Thus, 23
rabbits had successful occlusion of the MCA and/or the
ACA as documented by angiography. These rabbits completed the treatment regimens with recorded percent stroke volumes and NAS scores and documentation of brain structures
impacted by infarct.
Overall, a three-group comparison using a Kruskal-Wallis
analysis indicated significance for the percent stroke outcome
variables at p=0.0003 and alpha of 0.05. The two group results were Bonferroni adjusted to test at alpha 0.025. Two
group comparisons of %SV indicated that in the placebo
CON, tPA, and D + tPA treatment groups, the median values
were 5.61, 2.32, and 0.52 %, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2). The
tPA group was significantly lower in median percent stroke
volume than the placebo controls (p=0.0078 with alpha set at
0.025). The comparison of the D + tPA test group median
percent stroke volume was significantly less than the tPA control group at p=0.0018, with alpha set at 0.025.
The neurological deficits were different in a Kruskal-Wallis
analysis between treatment groups, at p=0.0015, with alpha at
0.05 (Fig. 3). In Bonferroni-adjusted two group comparisons of
NAS, there was no difference between deficits in placebo controls (NAS 18) vs. tPA (NAS 9), p=0.051, when alpha was set at
p=0.025. The addition of DDFPe with tPA lytic therapy (NAS
0) significantly decreased stroke neurological deficits compared
to the tPA only group, p=0.0052, with alpha at 0.025.
The percent of positive hemorrhagic results between treatment groups was non-significant (Table 2) at an exact p value
of 0.10. In the D + tPA group, the two identified with hemorrhage were also the only two that had infarct in tissues impacted from posterior cerebral arterial distribution. No angiographic evidence of posterior emboli was seen in these animals. Analysis of the placebo controls showed 80 % (4/5)
were collected earlier than 24 h compared to tPA only when
18 % (2/11) was collected earlier and 0 % (0/6) when DDFPe
was included as a treatment (Table 2). The early collections

Discussion
The saying BTime is Brain^ still holds true. Delay remains the
biggest single enemy of successful ischemic stroke outcomes.
After almost 20 years of massive effort striving toward prompt
clinical tPA thrombolysis for ischemic stroke, we routinely
fail to provide thrombolysis due to delays. They are real.
They are common. They lurk everywhere.
The translation of animal study results into human therapies
requires animal models that closely parallel the human situation
and standard models may need changes to match clinical reality.
After watching case after case of acute human stroke arrive too
late for thrombolysis and reperfusion therapy by any method, it
became painfully apparent to us that improved speed in transportation and clinical workup alone would not allow acute therapy to reach many patients. We needed something to Bstop the
clock^ early in the process, in the field if possible, to preserve
the ischemic brain in its BGolden Hour^ when recovery is most
possible, and allow the reperfusion techniques adequate time to
be applied and take effect. This is not a new conclusion, just an
old one that is again reconfirmed by current clinical experience.
Therefore, to modify our proven embolic clot stroke model in
rabbits to include the common delays that we experience clinically, we increased our previous delays of 1 to 3 h to a delay of
9 h following embolization for thrombolysis with tPA. Then we
could test therapies in a meaningful model, one related to actual
clinical delays.

This model addresses another facet of the problem, the
effect of reperfusion using the clinical drug, IV tPA.
Reperfusion is a double-edged sword which can be associated
with severe side effects including brain swelling, tPA neurotoxicity, and hemorrhage in addition to the desired oxygenation and revitalization of ischemic penumbra. Several rat
models have shown poor outcomes with reperfusion in strokes
which further cloud the issue [11].
The nanodroplet perfluorocarbon, DDFPe, acting as a
neuro-protectant in animals [3, 4, 12] has also been tested as
an ultrasound contrast agent in more than 2200 humans in the
past with only minor adverse events [13, 14]. Its effectiveness
as an oxygen transport agent is well proven both in bench top
studies and in multiple animal studies [12, 15]. The mechanism of action seems to primarily be in improved oxygen
transport without need for red blood cell flow, but the details
remain to be fully defined and are not addressed here. Basic
pharmacokinetic characteristics have been reported in humans
and rabbits [4, 16]. It is currently undergoing a human trial in
brain tumor patients to augment tumor oxygenation and the
effect of radiation on the tumors.
Our earlier work has shown that rabbits can demonstrate
about 80 % decrease in infarct size with DDFPe given IV starting
as late as 3 h following embolization and, when starting at 1 h
after embolization, the brain can maintain both neurological
function and preserve viable brain for many hours with repeated
doses of IV DDFPe. Dramatic neuroprotection has been demonstrated out to 24 h of permanent occlusion in some variations of
the model. Similar permanent occlusion models in two strains of
rats have also shown strong neuroprotective effects [9].
With its promising results, DDFPe became our primary
candidate for testing in the long delay-to-lysis model and
was compared to placebo + delayed tPA therapy.
At three times the official FDA acceptable delay and twice
the acceptable delay outside the USA, DDFPe provided successful neuroprotection through 9 h of delay before standard
IV tPA lytic therapy. With DDFPe, excellent and strongly
significant improvements were shown in both %SV and
NAS compared to the control group which received standard
IV tPA therapy alone at 9 h. At 24 h the rabbits were fully
recovered and evaluated for behavior and neurological deficits, free of any potential procedural anesthetic effects. This
time also allowed definition of completely developed infarcts
on TTC analysis. The excellent NAS scores and final appearance of the brains themselves discount concerns of possible

assess uncommon side effects and complications. Still,
the translation into humans is such a leap that more animal work may not need to be justified before human trials. Other limitations include more frequent fragmentation
of the aged clot emboli in this series than in prior work.
This provided extra fragments that not only occluded the
anterior circulation but were flow directed to cause visible
occlusions in the posterior circulation of several animals.
This is by definition a non-standard occlusion and often
causes such severe symptoms that the animal could not
survive to scheduled sacrifice. These posterior occlusions
were uniformly discarded when seen on angiography and
contribute to the differences in final group numbers.
However, there seems to have been some very small or
late posterior occlusions seen on anatomic section which
were not seen on angiography. All standard angiographic
occlusions of the MCA and ACA were included in this
analysis. Another limitation is that the effective rabbit
window for tPA use is not fully defined by studying only
one point at 9 h. Many more animals will be required to
completely define that window for thrombolysis, but it
seems that results at 9 h with D + tPA are clearly superior
to only tPA.

Limitations
The study is limited by the small numbers tested. A much

Conclusion
Intravenous DDFPe can support brain function (NAS) and
brain tissue (%SV) to the time of greatly delayed reperfusion
in the rabbit embolic stroke model, basically stopping the
clock on stroke progression. No significant adverse events
were seen and rapid progress to testing in humans seems to
be the next appropriate step. The long anticipated method to
expand the BGolden Hour^ and the time window for acute
stroke therapy may finally be at hand.
