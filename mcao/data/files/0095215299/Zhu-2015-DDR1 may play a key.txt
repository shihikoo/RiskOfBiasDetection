a b s t r a c t
Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) has been shown to mediate matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
secretions and degrade all extracellular matrix compounds in mammalian tumor cells. We hypothesized
that DDR1 expression will be elevated and the blood–brain barrier (BBB) will be damaged after focal
cerebral ischemia in rats. Inhibiting DDR1 expression can alleviate BBB disruption and cerebral ischemic
damage via down-regulation of MMP-9 expression and activity. To test our hypothesis, we injected speciﬁc DDR1 siRNA into ipsilateral ischemic lateral ventricles in a focal ischemic model. Our results showed
that phospho-DDR1 expression increased after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury (p < 0.01). Inactivation
of DDR1 by speciﬁc siRNA caused a decrease in phospho-DDR1 and MMP-9 expression in the ischemic
cortex, reduced stroke-induced infarct volume, and alleviated BBB disruption in rat brain following I/R
injury (p < 0.01). Our results suggested that DDR1-siRNA attenuates phospho-DDR1 and MMP-9 upregulation, which was followed by a reduction in infarction and BBB disruption in the ischemic brain after
I/R injury. DDR1 may represent a molecular target for the prevention of BBB disruption after cerebral I/R
injury.

1. Introduction
Discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), which belongs to diskshaped receptor tyrosine kinases (DDRs), mainly regulates collagen
synthesis and degradation, and monitors extracellular matrix
(ECM) component formation (Vogel et al., 1997). Previous studies showed that DDR1 is overexpressed in some rapidly growing
tumors, such as in lung, liver and breast cancers (Valencia et al.,
2012). DDR1 degrades the ECM by upregulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression in glioma and pituitary adenomas,
thereby enhancing tumor invasiveness (Ram et al., 2006).
MMPs are a group of Zn2+ -dependent endopeptidases that
can degrade and remodel the extracellular matrix. Among the

MMPs, MMP-9 is closely related to the degree of ischemic brain
injury (Wu et al., 2012). Various exogenous injury factors or brain
ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) can cause an increase in oxygen free
radicals and the inﬂammatory response, which could degrade the
basement membrane and ECM components of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) by activating matrix metalloproteinases, such as MMP-9
and MMP-3, and thereby damaging the BBB (Lakhan et al., 2013).
Studies in a variety of tumor cells (including nervous system
tumors) have conﬁrmed that DDR1 activation causes tumor cells to
upregulate the MMP-9 expression (Roig et al., 2010). However, the
variation in DDR1 expression in cerebral I/R injury is still unclear,
and whether it can cause BBB damage by regulating MMP-9 expression is yet to be conﬁrmed.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Rats
All experimental procedures were approved by the Committee of Animal Use for Research and Education of the Fourth
Military Medical University. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing
250–300 g, were randomly assigned to the following four groups:

sham surgery (control group), middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO group), MCAO treated with control siRNA (siRNA-c group)
or DDR1 siRNA (siRNA group).
2.2. MCAO
Rats were subjected to MCAO using the method described previously, with some modiﬁcations (Tatlisumak et al., 1998). Brieﬂy,
rats were fasted for 12 h but were allowed free access to water
before surgery. Animals were anesthetized using 2.5% isoﬂurane.
Rectal temperature was monitored (Spacelabs Medical Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) and maintained at 36.5–37.5 ◦ C using surface
heating and cooling. The right common carotid artery, internal
carotid artery and external carotid artery (CCA, ICA and ECA), were
surgically exposed. The ECA was isolated and ligated. A 4-0 nylon
suture (Ethilon Nylon Suture; Ethicon Inc., Osaka, Japan) with its tip
rounded by heating near a ﬂame was inserted into the ICA through
the CCA stump and gently advanced to occlude the MCA. The right
ICA was isolated but not occluded in the control group. After 2 h, the
suture was carefully removed from ICA to restore blood ﬂow. After
recovery from anesthesia, the rats were returned to their cages with
free access to food and water. Animals in each group were assigned
to subgroups for TTC staining, Evans blue exudation, a brain water
content study, Western blotting or zymography.
2.3. Intracerebroventricular injection
An intracerebroventricular mixture (10 ␮l) was injected 3 days
before 2 h of focal ischemia. In the siRNA/siRNA-c group, 250 ␮l
RNase-free water (QIAGEN) was added to the 5 nmol lyophilized
siRNA (sense strand: 5 -GGCUCCGUUUCAAGGAGAATT-3 and antisense strand 5 -UUCUCCUUGAAACGGAGCCGT-3 , QIAGEN, Catalog
no.101505511, Germany) or Allstars negative control siRNA
(sense: Proprietary and antisense: Proprietary, QIAGEN, Catalog
no. 1027280, Germany) to obtain a 20 ␮M/l solution, respectively. Intracerebroventricular injection was executed according to
a protocol, as previously described (Senn et al., 2005). Rats were
anesthetized and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf
Instrument, Tujunga, USA). siRNA/siRNA-c (10 ␮l) was injected into
the right lateral ventricle over a 5 min duration using a Hamilton microsyringe with the coordinates of 0.8 mm posterior to the
bregma, 1.5 mm lateral to the midline, and 4.0 mm ventral to the
surface of the skull under the guidance of a stereotaxic instrument.
Rats in the control and MCAO groups received the same volume of
RNase-free water (QIAGEN).
2.4. Neurobehavioral evaluation
The neurological scores were evaluated at 24 h after MCAO (n = 8
for each group) using a scoring system, as previously described
(Garcia et al., 1995). The score was the sum of six individual test
scores (Spontaneous activity, Symmetry in the movement of four
limbs, Forepaw outstretching, Climbing, Body proprioception, and
Response to vibrissae touch). The neurological score was between
3 and 18; a higher score indicates better neurobehavioral status of
the animals.
2.5. Infarct volume assessment
The infarct volume was assessed using TTC staining, as previously described (Cai et al., 2014). Brieﬂy, the rats were decapitated
after the neurological evaluation. The brain was rapidly removed
and was reverse-cut into 6 slices from the beginning of the herringbone stitch, and each slice thickness was 2 mm. The tissue was
then immersed in 2% TTC at 37 ◦ C for 15 min and ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 24 h. The brain slices were photographed

15

using a digital camera (Canon, Japan). Unstained areas were deﬁned
as infarcts and quantiﬁed using Photoshop CS3. The infarct volume was calculated by multiplying the unstained areas and the
slice thickness. The total infarct volume was calculated by adding
together the areas from all six slices.
2.6. Determination of brain water content
Brain water content was determined using the wet/dry method.
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the brains (n = 8 in each group)
were removed and immediately separated into two parts: ipsilateral ischemic hemispheres and contralateral hemispheres. The
brain tissues were weighed after removal (wet weight) and again
after drying in an oven at 105 ◦ C for 24 h. The percentage of
water content was calculated as [(wet weight − dry weight)/wet
weight] × 100%.
2.7. Quantitative measurement of BBB integrity
Disruption of the BBB was analyzed at 24 h after MCAO (n = 12
for each group) using Evans blue dye, as reported previously (Park
et al., 2004). Brieﬂy, rats were deeply anesthetized with chloral
hydrate (10%, 3.5 ml/kg), and Evans blue dye (4%, 2.5 ml/kg) was
injected over 2 min into the left femoral vein and allowed to circulate for 60 min. Then the rats were perfused with PBS transcardially
until a colorless perfusion ﬂuid was obtained from the right atrium.
Some rats (n = 4 per group) were used for the quantitative determination of Evans blue exudation. The brains were removed and
separated into ischemic/contralateral hemispheres. The ischemic
hemispheres were weighted and homogenized in ten-fold volume
of 50% trichloroacetic acid solution. The supernatant was obtained
by centrifugation and diluted fourfold with ethanol. The ﬂuorescence intensity was determined using a microplate ﬂuorescent
reader. Evans blue extravasation was quantiﬁed in the supernatants using spectrophotometry. The amount of extravasated
Evans blue dye was quantiﬁed as microgram per gram of brain
tissue. Extravasation of Evans blue dye was also observed under
a ﬂuorescence microscope. Other rats (n = 4 per group) were
intraperitoneally perfused with PBS and the rat brains were ﬁxed
with 4% paraformaldehyde following a 200 ml perfusion for 30 min.
Then the brains were removed after decapitation, the whole brain
was photographed, and then cut into 3 coronal slices 3 mm from the
front of the optic chiasm. Each slice thickness was 2 mm and was
photographed again. Consecutive coronal brain sections were taken
from the remainder of the rats (n = 4 per group) and were frozen
at −20 ◦ C using a freezing microtome (CM1900 Leica, Germany).
Frozen sections began from 3 mm in front of the optic chiasm; each
slice thickness was 20 ␮m and was directly afﬁxed to the glass slide.
The red Evans blue stain in the ischemic penumbra cortex, excited
by green ﬂuorescent dye light was observed using ﬂuorescence
microscopy, and photographed.
2.8. Immunoﬂuorescence
Double ﬂuorescent labeling was performed as described previously (Yin et al., 2003). Brieﬂy, after MCAO for 24 h, rats were
intraperitoneally perfused with 200 ml of saline and the brains
were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde using a 200 ml perfusion
for 30 min. The brains were then removed after decapitation and
consecutively sliced coronally at −20 ◦ C using a freezing microtome (CM1900 Leica, Germany). Frozen sections began from 3 mm
in front of the optic chiasm; each slice thickness was 12 ␮m and
was directly afﬁxed to the glass slide. After rinsing 3 times with
PBS, brain sections were incubated with the primary antibodies
DDR1 (C-20, dilution 1:100, sc-532) and mouse anti-NeuN (dilution 1:1000, MAB377) at 4 ◦ C for 24 h. After rinsing with PBS three

16

M. Zhu et al. / Neuroscience Research 96 (2015) 14–19

times, the sections were incubated for 1 h in Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated (EK011) or Cy3 conjugated (EK022) secondary antibodies
(each diluted to 1:100). The sections were mounted and then visualized using a ﬂuorescent microscope (Olympus), and photographs
were taken.
2.9. Western blot analysis
The DDR1, p-DDR1 (Tyr513) and MMP-9 protein level in
ischemic penumbra was investigated using Western blotting at
control, MCAO (at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion), siRNA
(MCAO24 h + DDR1-siRNA) and siRNA-c (MCAO24 h + siRNA-c)
groups. Rats in eight groups (n = 5 for each group and each time
point, n = 40) were sacriﬁced using an overdose of 10% chloral
hydrate, and the brains were removed quickly, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen after separation of ischemic penumbra and stored at
−80 ◦ C until analysis. Protein was extracted as described previously
(Dong et al., 2009). Equal amounts (40 ␮g) of homogenized tissues mixed with 4× sample buffer were resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE
and transferred to a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane. The NC membrane was placed in a blocking solution containing 5% skim milk
for 1.5–2 h. After blocking, the membrane was washed 3 times
with TBST for 5 min each, and then was incubated overnight with
the primary antibodies at 4 ◦ C. The primary antibodies were DDR1
(C-20, dilution 1:100, sc-532); p-DDR1 (phosphor-Tyr513, dilution 1:100, orb101885); MMP-9 (C-20, dilution 1:100, sc-6840);
and GAPDH (10B8, dilution 1:1000, KGAA002). The next day, the
membrane was washed 3 times with TBST for 5 min each, incubated with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-labeled
goat anti-rabbit IgG(H + L)) for 1–2 h at room temperature, and then
imaged. The densitometry scan was performed using a GS-700
imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA)
and the results were quantiﬁed using Multi-Analyst software (BioRad Laboratories). The ratio of optical density to that of the vehicle
was statistically evaluated.
2.10. SDS-PAGE zymogram
MMP-9 enzyme activity was assessed using zymogram analysis
(Heo et al., 1999). Brieﬂy, equal amounts (20 ␮g) of total protein
extracts were prepared and mixed with 5× sample buffer. Each
sample was separated under 100 V for 1.5 h using Tris–glycine
SDS-PAGE with gelatin (1 mg/ml) at 4 ◦ C. After electrophoresis
was completed, the gel was placed in eluent (2.5% Triton X-100,
50 mmol/l Tris–HCl, 5 mmol/l CaCl2 , pH 7.6), washed twice with
water for 40 min, rinsed twice for 40 min each with the same as
for the eluent, but excluding Triton X-100, and then incubated for
42 h at 37 ◦ C in a solution (50 mmol/l Tris–HCl, 5 mmol/CaCl2 , 0.02%
Brij-35, pH 7.6). After incubation, the gel was stained for 3 h (0.05%
Coomassie blue, 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid), and bleached for
0.5, 1, and 2 h with bleaching solution A, B, and C (methanol concentration of 30%, 20%, and 10%, acetic acid concentration was 10%,
10%, and 5%), respectively. Enzyme activity attributed to MMP-2
(72 kD) and MMP-9 (92 kD) was visualized in the gelatin-containing
zymograms as clear bands against a blue background.
2.10.1. Statistical analysis
Data are shown as mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was performed
using GraphPad Prism 5 unless otherwise stated. A two-tailed Student’s t-test was used for comparison of two groups. A one-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni’s multiple comparisons post hoc test was
used to compare more than two groups, and a two-way ANOVA
with Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used to compare two independent variables. A p value less than 0.05 was considered to be
signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. The phospho-DDR1 level was signiﬁcantly increased after
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury and DDR1-siRNA could
signiﬁcantly decrease the DDR1 and phospho-DDR1 levels (Fig. 1)
As shown in Fig. 1A, DDR1 is mainly expressed in neurons. Compared with the control group, there was no change in the DDR1
protein level in the cortex of the ischemic penumbra zone after
MCAO. Compared with the MCAO group, the DDR1 level was signiﬁcantly reduced in the siRNA group, while DDR1 expression in
the siRNA-c group did not change.
We used Western blotting to detect DDR1 and phospho-DDR1
expression levels at different time points after I/R injury (Fig. 1B).
Compared with the control group, phospho-DDR1 expression levels
after I/R injury from 3 h to 24 h showed variable increases, peaked
at 24 h and continued to 48 h. However, DDR1 and phospho-DDR1
expression levels in the siRNA group were signiﬁcantly decreased
compared to MCAO in the 24 h group (p < 0.05), and there was
no signiﬁcant change in these two proteins in the siRNA-c group
(p > 0.05).
3.2. The expression and activity of MMP-9 signiﬁcantly increased
after MCAO, inhibition the expression of DDR1 can reduce the
expression and activity of MMP-9 (Fig. 2)
MMP-9 expression and activity were detected using Western
blotting and gelatin zymogram analysis, respectively. As shown in
Fig. 2A and B, under normal circumstances, MMP-9 expression was
low and activity was low, but as the duration of I/R time increased,
the MMP-9 expression and activity levels also increased to varying
degrees. The MMP-9 bands (92 kDa) were detected as early as 3 h
after reperfusion, continuously increased up to 24 h and continued
to 48 h, while the siRNA group showed weaker immunoreactive
bands at 24 h after reperfusion (p < 0.05). No signiﬁcant change in
MMP-9 was detected in the siRNA-c group (p > 0.05).
3.3. Inhibiting DDR1 expression after MCAO signiﬁcantly
decreased BBB integrity (Fig. 3)
BBB integrity was evaluated using Evans blue extravasation.
As shown in Fig. 3A and B, considerable Evans blue leakage was
visualized in the ipsilateral cortex in the MCAO group; however, less Evans blue spillover was observed in the siRNA group.
Quantitative analysis of Evans blue using a spectrophotometer
was shown in Fig. 3C. We observed a signiﬁcant decrease in
Evans blue content in the siRNA group (4.95 ± 0.99 ␮g/g) compared with the MCAO group (9.49 ± 0.61 ␮g/g) (p < 0.01). Similarly,
brain water content was increased 24 h after reperfusion in the
MCAO group compared with the control groups. However, the
brain water content in the siRNA group (79.76 ± 1.05%) was lower
compared with the MCAO group (83.73 ± 0.44%; p < 0.01; Fig. 3D).
In addition, we observed no signiﬁcant change in the BBB permeability in the siRNA-c group compared with the MCAO group
(p > 0.05).
3.4. Inhibiting DDR1 expression after MCAO signiﬁcantly
improved neurological scores and decreased infarct volume
percentage (Fig. 4)
All animals survived until 24 h after reperfusion, when the neurological scores and infarct volume percentages were assessed.
Compared with the control group, the rats’ neurobehavioral scores
decreased and the infarct volume percentages increased after
MCAO. The siRNA group neurological scores (12.63 ± 1.408) were
higher compared with the MCAO group (6.250 ± 0.8864, p < 0.01)

and the siRNA group infarct volume (22.45 ± 3.018%) was lower
compared with the MCAO group (44.75 ± 3.778%, p < 0.05). In addition, we observed no signiﬁcant change for neurobehavioral scores
and infarct volume percentages in rats in the siRNA-c group compared with the MCAO group (p > 0.05).
4. Discussion
This study showed that phospho-DDR1 expression increased
after cerebral I/R injury, and that inhibiting DDR1 expression using
an intracerebroventricular siRNA injection downregulates MMP9
expression and activity and reduces the BBB permeability. Our
results indicate that I/R injury does not induce an increase in
DDR1 expression levels in the ischemic cerebral penumbra. However, it induces DDR1 tyrosine phosphorylation and the DDR1
activation extended for at least 48 h. MMP-9 expression also
increased to varying degrees, while inhibiting DDR1 expression
using an intracerebroventricular siRNA injection downregulated
DDR1, phospho-DDR1 and MMP-9 expression. Glial cells are a
more important source of MMP-9 than neurons, under various CNS
pathological conditions including ischemia and inﬂammation in
the brain (Kaczmarek et al., 2002). Double immunoﬂuorescence
staining with DDR1 and NeuN showed that DDR1 was mainly

expressed in neurons, and that its expression in astrocytes was low
(Supplementary Fig. S1). This is not consistent with previous
studies (Franco-Pons et al., 2006; Sánchez et al., 1994), which
showed that in the adult brain, DDR1 is expressed in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes but not in neurons. We speculate that
such differences may exist because our research focused on DDR1
expression in the ischemic penumbra in brain using a MCAO model,
while previous studies have focused on DDR1 expression in normal brain tissue and its physiological function on myelination.
In addition, previous studies showed that DDR1 activation upregulates the production of chemokines in an NF-␬B-dependent
manner and is likely to contribute to the development of inﬂammatory responses in the tissue microenvironment (Matsuyama
et al., 2004). Studies also showed that invading inﬂammatory cells
can provide the major source of the MMP activity (Kaczmarek
et al., 2002). Moreover, MMP-9 is expressed in adult brain neurons and is responsive to changes in neuronal activity (Dzwonek
et al., 2004). Combined with the results of previous research
(Castro-Sanchez et al., 2011), we hypothesized that MMP-9 overexpression and activation after cerebral ischemic injury may be
regulated by its upstream molecule (DDR1) via inﬂammatory
responses, which provided a reliable basis for our next experiments.

Our western blotting results showed that phospho-DDR1 levels continued to increase after I/R injury, and the overall activation
trend between phospho-DDR1 and MMP-9 was the same. We found
that phospho-DDR1 expression started to increase signiﬁcantly
at 12 h after I/R injury, which may be related to characteristics
of DDR1-speciﬁc phosphorylation. Previous studies have shown
that compared with other classical receptor tyrosine kinases, such
as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphorylation of
DDR1 is relatively slow and long-lasting, requiring at least 18 h to
reach full activation and maintaining this level for 4 days (Carafoli
and Hohenester, 2013). Our study indicated that phospho-DDR1
increased signiﬁcantly at 12 h after reperfusion, peaked at 24 h
and continued for 48 h. In addition, recent studies have shown

that the damage to the BBB after ischemic injury begins at 20 min
after injury, is signiﬁcantly increased at 12 h after ischemia, and
continues to increase until a few weeks after ischemia (Khatri et al.,
2012). This shows that there is consistency between the changes in
phospho-DDR1 and the opening trends of BBB permeability after
ischemic injury. It also shows that DDR1 is associated with BBB
destruction after brain injury.
Previous studies have shown that inhibiting MMP-9 expression
after I/R injury decreases the BBB permeability and brain damage,
which in turn improves neurobehavioral scores and reduces infarct
size in rats after brain injury (Piao et al., 2009). Our study also found
that inhibiting DDR1 activity signiﬁcantly reduced MMP-9 levels,
thereby reducing the infarct size, and neurobehavioral scores were

also improved. This indicates that there is a DDR1 and MMP-9 pathway, which is similar to that in tumor tissue, in the central nervous
system; DDR1-siRNA also lowered MMP-9 expression and activity
by inhibiting DDR1 activity, and decreased the BBB permeability
and cerebral ischemic injury.
Numerous factors contribute to BBB destruction because of its
complex molecular mechanism. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most
widely used treatment method for the BBB, but they have many side
effects and their treatment effects are not speciﬁc (Tuckermann
et al., 2005). DDR1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is associated
with a variety of cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, migration and invasion. DDR1 is expressed
in normal tissues of organs such as the lungs, kidneys, colon, and
brain as well as in the tumor cells of epithelial origin, such as those
of breast, ovarian, and lung carcinomas (Vogel, 1999). In addition,
MMP-9 can cause damage to the BBB (Yang and Rosenberg, 2011)
by degrading type IV collagen in the basement membrane during cerebral ischemia. Type IV collagen, as a ligand of DDR1, can
activate DDR1 to independently cause phosphorylation (Fu et al.,
2013). Therefore, there may be a vicious cycle between type IV collagen and DDR1-MMP-9 in inﬂammatory cells, endothelial cells,
and glial cells, which is involved in destruction of the BBB after cerebral ischemic injury. This mechanism can cycle and cause serious
damage to the basement membrane, which in turn causes further
brain damage, but the exact mechanism between DDR1 and MMP9 remains unknown. Further research is required to clarify this
mechanism.
In conclusion, this study conﬁrmed that the DDR1 protein plays
an important role in ischemic brain injury. Suppressing DDR1 activity maintains the BBB integrity and reduces brain injury after
reperfusion. In addition, we found that the DDR1 protein affected
the BBB permeability and brain injury by regulating downstream
molecules, such as MMP-9.
