Background and Purpose—Systemic inflammation contributes to diverse acute and chronic brain pathologies, and extensive
evidence implicates inflammation in stroke susceptibility and poor outcome. Here we investigate whether systemic
inflammation alters cerebral blood flow during reperfusion after experimental cerebral ischemia.
Methods—Serial diffusion and perfusion-weighted MRI was performed after reperfusion in Wistar rats given systemic
(intraperitoneal) interleukin-1β or vehicle before 60-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. The expression
and location of endothelin-1 was assessed by polymerase chain reaction, ELISA, and immunofluorescence.
Results—Systemic interleukin-1 caused a severe reduction in cerebral blood flow and increase in infarct volume compared
with vehicle. Restriction in cerebral blood flow was observed alongside activation of the cerebral vasculature and
upregulation of the vasoconstricting peptide endothelin-1 in the ischemic penumbra. A microthrombotic profile was also
observed in the vasculature of rats receiving interleukin-1. Blockade of endothelin-1 receptors reversed this hypoperfusion,
reduced tissue damage, and improved functional outcome.
Conclusions—These data suggest patients with a raised inflammatory profile may have persistent deficits in perfusion after
reopening of an occluded vessel. Future therapeutic strategies to interrupt the mechanism identified could lead to enhanced
recovery of penumbra in patients with a heightened inflammatory burden and a better outcome after stroke.   (Stroke.

shown that when recanalization is achieved it does not necessarily lead to restoration of tissue blood flow.13 Restoration of
CBF is likely to be more important than recanalization, and
consistent with this, tissue reperfusion has been shown to be a
better predictor of recovery from stroke than recanalization.14
Preexisting systemic inflammation may influence mechanisms
needed to sustain adequate perfusion after stroke. Therefore, we
have used a previously validated model15 of systemic inflammation to test the hypothesis that upregulation of vasoactive
mediators may contribute to the observed association between
inflammation and poor outcome after cerebral ischemia. We show
that systemic IL-1 markedly increases the extent of tissue hypoperfusion after reperfusion; increased expression of endothelin-1
(ET-1) accompanies this hypoperfusion and that blockade of this
mechanism results in restoration of CBF, reduced infarct, and an
improved outcome after experimental stroke.

raised systemic inflammatory profile is observed in
comorbidities associated with vascular disease, including hypertension, infection, atherosclerosis, obesity, and
diabetes mellitus.1–3 Observational clinical studies show that
inflammation is independently associated with an increased
risk of stroke as well as poor poststroke outcomes.4,5 Robust
preclinical evidence shows that systemic inflammation markedly exacerbates acute brain injury,6,7 but the underlying
mechanisms remain unclear. The proinflammatory cytokine
interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major driver of inflammation, and the
detrimental effects of systemic IL-1 are well documented in
multiple preclinical models of systemic inflammatory disease
as well as in cerebral ischemia.8–10
Rapid restoration of cerebral blood flow (CBF) after acute
ischemia, either spontaneously or through thrombolysis,
reduces tissue damage. However, the benefit of reperfusion
falls within a few hours of onset of ischemia, eventually
becoming potentially harmful if timely reperfusion is not
achieved.11 Recanalization is an established reperfusion therapy for acute stroke12; however, human imaging studies have

Results
Acute Systemic Inflammatory Challenge Lowered
CBF and Worsened Ischemic Damage
Systemic inflammation induced by peripheral administration
of IL-1β resulted in larger infarct volumes at 24 hours (vehicle, 66±19 mm3; IL-1β, 166±32 mm3; *P<0.05; Figure 1A).
IL-1β–treated animals had a 3-fold higher volume of hypoperfused tissue 15 minutes after reopening the middle cerebral
artery, versus vehicle (vehicle, 22±7 mm3; IL-1β, 70±30 mm3;
***P<0.001; Figure 1B). The volume of hypoperfused tissue
in IL-1β–treated animals remained significantly higher up to
2 hours after MCA reopening. Treatment with IL-1β did not
alter CBF in sham-treated animals (data not shown). ADCderived lesion volumes were significantly higher (2-fold) in
IL-1β–treated compared with vehicle-treated rats at 3 and 4
hours reperfusion (**P<0.01; Figure 1C).

ETrA is localized to smooth muscle in areas of perfusion

integral step in brain endothelial cytoskeletal reorganization)
and α-smooth muscle actin were colocalized in cortical arteries of IL-1β– treated animals at 15 minutes and 4 hours after
cerebral ischemia alone (Figure 3A, arrowhead).
ET-1 (Figure 3B, closed arrowhead) was identified in animals receiving IL-1β before cerebral ischemia at both 15
minutes and 4 hours after reperfusion, but in vehicle-treated
animals, there was no ET-1 staining at 15 minutes and minimal ET-1 staining at 4 hours. Vessels that stained positive for
ET-1 also expressed ETrA and were localized to the ipsilateral
hemisphere of IL-1β–treated animals (Figure II in the onlineonly Data Supplement).

A diffusion-weighted imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging mismatch was seen 15 minutes, 2 hours, and 4 hours
after MCAo in animals receiving vehicle, IL-1β, vehicle
plus BQ-123 or IL-1β plus BQ-123 (Figure 4A). Animals
treated with IL-1β had a significantly larger perfusion deficit at 15 minutes (vehicle, 33±11 mm3; IL-1β, 73±26 mm3;
***P<0.001). In contrast, in animals treated with IL-1β
plus BQ-123, the volume of hypoperfusion was reduced to
levels seen in the vehicle-treated group (IL-1β, 73±26 mm3;
IL-1β plus BQ-123, 38±15 mm3; ***P<0.001; Figure 4B).

ADC-derived lesion volume was larger in IL-1β–treated than
in vehicle-treated rats at 4 hours reperfusion (vehicle, 26±10
mm3; IL-1β, 60±34 mm3; ***P<0.001). However, in animals
treated with IL-1β plus BQ-123, the volume of infarction was
markedly reduced at 4 hours reperfusion (IL-1β, 73±26 mm3;
IL-1β plus BQ-123, 38±15 mm3; ***P<0.001), such that volumes were not significantly different to vehicle-treated animals (Figure 4C).

Blockade of ETrA Reduced Ischemic Damage and
Improved Behavioral Outcomes
Systemic IL-1β challenge before MCAo exacerbated the
extent of ischemic brain injury (3-fold) and functional deficits at 48 hours reperfusion (Figure 5A and 5B). Conversely,
administration of BQ-123 in the presence of IL-1β and MCAo
markedly attenuated (4-fold) ischemic damage and behavioral
deficits (Figure 5C). The incidence of hemorrhagic transformation (Figure 5D) was not significantly increased in animals receiving BQ-123 (numbers of animals presenting with
hemorrhagic transformation: vehicle, n= 2/6; IL-1β, n=1/6;

Discussion
Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

We have shown that systemic IL-1β has a crucial role in limiting blood flow to metabolically compromised brain tissue,
and upregulation in ET-1 plays an important role in this process despite recanalization. Restoration of CBF during acute
reperfusion was achieved through ETrA antagonism, leading
to improved tissue survival and functional outcomes.
Clinical and experimental studies show an association
between inflammation and a higher risk of ischemic stroke
as well as worse poststroke outcome.24,25 Elevated IL-1β is
a central component of these pathologies as seen in chronic
and acute inflammatory models2,26; thus, administration of
systemic IL-1β is a relevant model for many conditions that
predispose to stroke. It is thought that much of the detrimental

actions of IL-1β on ischemic stroke are exerted peripherally
as levels of IL-1β are undetectable in the brain.10 Furthermore,
IL-1β has been shown to affect the magnitude of the acute
phase response, which is a key indicator or peripheral inflammation. IL-1β causes an increase in C-reactive protein and
IL-6, and in both preclinical10 and clinical studies,27 raised
levels of these markers are associated with poor prognosis.
Peripherally administered lipopolysaccharide, which mimics aspects of infection, has also been used to represent acute
inflammation before stroke, and mice treated with lipopolysaccharide just before stroke show a marked increase in ischemic injury, an effect that is inhibited by administration of
the IL-1 receptor antagonist.10 Our recent data show that preceding pneumonia infection in mice also worsens ischemic
brain damage, an effect dependent again on IL-1β as well as
platelet–endothelial interactions.28 This suggests endogenous
IL-1β has a key role in exacerbation of ischemic damage by
systemic inflammation, most likely through effects on the
cerebrovasculature. Clinical relevance of these experimental findings is demonstrated by the finding that patients with
pneumonia develop systemic cytokine responses and show
raised levels of circulating IL-1β concentrations.29,30 Previous
studies have reported either no effect on blood vessel dynamics31 or a rise in cerebral blood volume32 in response to IL-1β,
but in both studies, IL-1β was administered in the absence of
injury and it is likely that IL-1β acts differently in the presence
of ischemia.33,34 Our finding that ET-1 was upregulated only
in animals exposed to both cerebral ischemia and an elevated
inflammatory status and not in sham-treated animals lends
further support to this hypothesis.

Figure 6. Systemic inflammation is associated with hypoperfusion and a prothrombotic state. The effect of systemic interleukin-1β (IL-1β)
on platelet adhesion and aggregation was assessed after 60 min ischemia. Immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of platelets in
vessels of animals treated with IL-1β at 4 h (A). Total numbers of platelets and aggregates at 4 h reperfusion were counted (B; Student t
test). Platelet numbers and aggregates were further analyzed in animals treated with vehicle plus BQ-123 and IL-1β plus BQ-123 at 4 h
(C; 2-way ANOVA; Bonferroni multiple comparison post-test). Scale bar, 50 μm. Data expressed as average number of cells/mm2 in the

Smooth muscle cells have a critical role in regulating vascular tone in response to vasoactive mediators released by the
endothelium35 and neighboring cells.36 Previous experimental studies have shown the potent vasoconstrictive effects of
ET-137 through its actions on ETrA on smooth muscle cells,
in contrast to the predominantly vasodilatory ET-1 receptor
B that is abundant on endothelium and neurons.38 Both ETrA
and ET-1 receptor B are upregulated after injury,39 but only
blockade of ETrA before injury prevents hypoperfusion.40
Although antagonism of ETrA restored CBF and reduced
ischemic damage in animals with a preexisting inflammatory
challenge, infarct was not reduced in stroke plus BQ-123–
treated animals as seen in previous studies.41 It is possible this
discrepancy was because of the negligible volume of penumbral tissue remaining (as indicated by the diffusion-weighted
imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging mismatch) for salvage by BQ-123. Furthermore, the observed increase in ET-1
expression and vessel contractility occurred primarily in the
cortex of IL-1β–treated animals. This colocalizes with tissue
at risk of infarction and suggests that endothelin antagonism
rescues penumbral tissue in the cortex rather than the necrotic
infarct core of the striatum.
Despite differences in disease progression, hypoperfusion
in both chronic and acute inflammatory conditions has been
established in the experimental42,43 and clinical setting.44 In
patients with multiple sclerosis, an increase in plasma ET-1
was noted alongside a corresponding reduction in CBF as
measured by perfusion-weighted imaging, whereas postmortem studies show an upregulation of ET-1 in the brain parenchyma in multiple sclerosis.45 The vasoconstrictive actions of
endothelium-derived ET-1 on smooth muscle are well elucidated, but here we report that the presence of systemic IL-1β
acts as a trigger for vessel contractility via ET-1 after cerebral
ischemia. It is possible that IL-1β activates the endothelium
to increase production of ET-1 because both ischemic stroke
and IL-1 are potent activators of the cerebrovasculature,46 and
endothelial cells are a source of ET-1.47 Although we cannot
rule out that other vasoactive mediators might contribute to
reductions in CBF in the presence of systemic inflammation,
our data do support an important, selective role for ET-1.
Our findings may have clinical implications beyond representing a mechanistic explanation for the worse outcome
observed in stroke patients with a preexisting elevated inflammatory status. Currently, recanalization represents a strong
predictor of stroke outcome and is being increasingly used as a
surrogate marker for efficacy in thrombolytic and other recanalization trials in acute stroke.13,48 However, we have shown that
an elevated systemic inflammatory profile can result in hypoperfusion and subsequent excess ischemic damage. This was
prevented by BQ-123, therefore suggesting that recanalization
does not necessarily lead to brain tissue reperfusion and that an
elevated inflammatory status may be an important complimentary therapeutic target for patients with stroke.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that systemic inflammation may worsen outcomes after cerebral ischemia by
IL-1β–induced hypoperfusion in the presence of ET-1 during
early reperfusion. This reduction in CBF leads to larger infarcts
and worse functional outcomes despite large vessel recanalization. Interrupting this mechanism pharmacologically may

improve recovery of CBF after thrombolysis or intra-arterial
recanalization in patients with a high peripheral inflammatory
burden, potentially improving outcomes after clinical stroke.

Systemic inflammation impairs tissue reperfusion through endothelin-dependent
mechanisms in cerebral ischemia

Katie N Murray, Sylvie Girard, William M Holmes, Laura M Parkes, Stephen R Williams,
Adrian R Parry-Jones, Stuart M Allan.

Supplementary methods
Animals: All experiments were performed using male, 9-week old, Wistar rats (350-450g)
(Charles River Laboratories, UK) under appropriate United Kingdom Home Office licenses
and all procedures adhered to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986).
Focal cerebral ischemia: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by transient (60min) middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) using a modification of the intraluminal filament model
originally described by Longa et al1. Core body temperature was regulated at 37°C±1°C by a
homeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus, UK). Anesthesia was induced (4%) and
maintained (1.5–2%) with isoflurane delivered in 70:30 N2O/O2. The bifurcation of the
carotid artery was exposed and a 30mm long, 0.19mm diameter suture with a silicon coated
tip measuring 350±20µm in diameter and 5-6mm in coating length monofilament (Doccol
Corporation, USA) was advanced along the internal carotid artery (ICA) until occlusion of
the MCA. The filament was withdrawn to establish reperfusion, monitored using Laser
Doppler flowmetry (Oxford Optronix, UK). Sham-operated animals underwent the same
procedure except the filament was advanced to the MCA, and then immediately withdrawn.
Mortality rate was <15% in all groups except where stated. The femoral artery was
cannulated for continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure (Fluid-filled pressure
transducer, AD Instruments, UK), blood gas analysis and blood sampling. Heart rate,
respiratory rate and temperature were continuously measured during the reperfusion period
(ECG trigger unit, Rapid Biomedical, UK).
Animals were excluded from statistical analysis based on an a priori exclusion criterion,
namely if Laser Doppler flowmetry did not indicate a drop in CBF of >60% at the point of
occlusion, if magnetic resonance angiography did not show full restoration of CBF following
remote reperfusion and in extremes of physiological measurements. Subarachnoid
hemorrhage was not observed in any groups in any experiments. Hemorrhagic transformation
was observed in 6 animals in total as detailed in figure 5D. Of the 128 animals undergoing
tMCAo, 16 rats met the a priori exclusion criteria during imaging/occlusion period prior to
recovery and were withdrawn from the study (the groups they occupied were: stroke + veh: 6;
stroke + IL-1β: 5; stroke + veh + BQ-123: 2; stroke + IL-1β + BQ-123: 3). 3 animals were
excluded from the studies following recovery from anesthesia from each of the following
groups: stroke + veh (labored breathing and non-responsive), stroke + IL-1β (labored
breathing and non-responsive), stroke + veh + BQ-123 (experienced seizure due to cortical
infarct). Of the 3 data points excluded from PCR analysis in figure 2 (groups: sham + IL-1β
and 2 from stroke + IL-1β), this was due to mRNA contamination as measured by nanodrop
values. Of the 3 animals excluded from protein analysis (groups: sham + veh, stroke + veh
1

and stroke + IL-1β), this was due to insufficient removal of protein debris which interfered
with the assay. For the purpose of the imaging experiments, group sizes were determined by
power calculation (α=0.05, β=0.2) assuming a group difference of 40% and a SD of 30%.
Assessment of neurological deficit: Neurological status and motor function was assessed
blinded to drug treatment and according to the 28-point neuroscore was which was modified
from methods previously described2. The 28 point neuroscore uses 11 tests with a cumulative
maximum score of 28: (1) circling (maximum 4 points), (2) motility (maximum 3 points), (3)
general condition (maximum 3 points), (4) righting reflex when placed on back (maximum 1
point), (5) paw placement of each paw onto a table top (maximum 4 points), (6) ability to pull
self up on a horizontal bar (maximum 3 points), (7) climbing on an inclined platform
(maximum 3 points), (8) grip strength (maximum 2 points), (9) contralateral reflex
(maximum 1 point), (10) contralateral rotation when held by the base of tail (maximum 2
points), and (11) visual forepaw reaching (maximum 2 points). Scoring was determined on a
scale starting from 0 for severe impairment to the maximum score for healthy function3.
MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a 7T horizontal bore magnet
(Agilent, UK) interfaced to a BrukerAvance III console (Bruker, UK) with separate volumetransmit and surface-receive radiofrequency coils. Coronal pilot images were acquired to
determine the correct geometry (using a multi-slice gradient echo sequence). Magnetic
resonance angiography was used to assess occlusion and re-opening of the MCA (TR =
15ms; TE = 3.8ms; flip angle [FA] = 80°; matrix size = 256x256; FOV = 4cm. 0.4mm slice
thickness; 0.25mm interslice distance; acquisition time = 11min 31s). Diffusion weighted
images (DWI) were obtained using a spin echo sequence (TE = 18.5ms; TR = 1800ms; 1
average; matrix = 96x96; FOV = 4cm; 3 directions = x, y, z; b values = 0 and 1000s/mm2; 9
contiguous slices; 2mm slice thickness; acquisition time = 5min 52s) to determine lesion
volume by calculating apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Perfusion weighted
imaging (PWI) was obtained using a pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling sequence
employing a train of 47 adiabatic inversion pulses over 3000ms followed by an EPI read-out4,
5
. 3 contiguous 2mm slices were selected spanning the MCAo territory (TE = 15.37ms; TR =
2500ms; 6 averages; matrix = 96x96; FOV = 4cm; 2mm slice thickness; 2mm interslice
distance; 40s acquisition time; EPI flip angle = 90°) and there was a 2cm offset between the
labeling and imaging slice4, 5. DWI and PWI scans were performed every hour for 4 hours,
post-reperfusion. Use of DWI-PWI allowed assessment of the temporal and spatial evolution
of CBF changes immediately following reperfusion in animals with a systemic inflammatory
challenge and correlation with infarct progression6.
MRI Analysis:
Co-aligned images from DWI and ASL imaging were used to generate quantitative ADC
maps and CBF maps respectively. Quantitative ADC maps were generated in Paravision 5
software (Bruker, Germany). A 23% reduction relative to mean contralateral ADC was used
as the threshold to define the ischemic lesion and lesion volume was determined from
multislice ADC maps7 using Image J (Java, General public license). A 57% reduction relative
to mean contralateral CBF was set as a threshold for hypoperfused tissue 8 with the volume of
hypoperfused tissue measured with Image J. Thresholds for acute perfusion lesion and tissue
at risk of infarction were previously identified and ASL has been shown to have similar
accuracy to PWI and CT perfusion-Tmax thresholds9. Negative perfusion values were
generated in some pixels with low or zero flow as a consequence of subtracting the
2

magnitude images (Scontrol and SLabel), where the signal difference was comparable to image
noise10. Negative ASL CBF values were assumed to be zero. Physiological measurements
were analyzed using MATLAB (MathWorks Inc, USA).
Tissue processing: For immunohistochemistry, rats were transcardially-perfused with 0.9%
saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde or 0.1% Diethyl Pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated
sterile saline. Brains were removed, post-fixed, cryoprotected, and frozen or snap frozen with
isopentane (Sigma, UK). For all experiments, sections (30µm) were cut on a sledge
microtome (Bright Series 8000, UK).
RNA Extraction and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR: Total RNA was extracted
from isolated striatum and cortex brain homogenate using Trizol (Life Sciences, UK)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed using MMLV RT,
oligo-dT, RNase out, and dNTPs (Life Sciences, UK). Detailed methods for the qPCR were
previously described11. All primers were from Qiagen (Quantitect Primers Assay, UK), and a
fast real-time PCR system (7900 HT, Applied Biosystem, UK) was used. Rat mRNA for ET1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxegenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin-E2
(PGE2) and P-selectin were analyzed due to their vasoactive and thrombotic capacity as
detailed previously12-14.The expression of two housekeeping genes was also analyzed (i.e.
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and succinate dehydrogenase
complex, subunit A (sDHA). No significant differences were observed between the
housekeeping genes (data not shown). The relative gene expression of the phenotype markers
was normalized to sDHA, and the levels of expression in each of the conditions determined
as fold increase compared with vehicle-treated sham animals.
Immunofluorescence: Free-floating sections (30µm thick) were washed in PBS and
incubated for 60min in blocking solution (PBS containing 5% donkey serum, Serotec, UK),
0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.5%Triton X-100). Sections were then incubated overnight
at 4°C in blocking solution with primary antibody (Ab) including rat anti-CD41 (BD
Bioscience, UK); goat anti-intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)(R&D System, UK);
mouse anti-alpha smooth muscle actin (Sigma, UK); rabbit anti-ET-1 (Biorbyt, UK); rabbit
anti-ET-1 receptor A (Abcam, UK); rabbit anti phospho-myosin light chain 2 (pMLC) (Cell
Signaling Technology, UK); rabbit anti-neutrophil serum (SJC) kindly provided by Drs.
Daniel Anthony and Sandra Campbell, University of Oxford. Sections were washed in PBS
and incubated with secondary Ab (anti-rabbit Alexa-594; anti-goat Alexa-488; anti-rat Alexa594; anti-mouse Alexa 488; Life Sciences, UK) for 3h. Sections were washed with PBS,
mounted onto slides and cover slipped with Prolong anti-fade medium (Life Sciences, UK).
Cell counts: Total numbers of cells in brain tissue sections were determined via wide field
microscopy on an Olympus BX51 upright microscope (Olympus, UK) and captured using
MetaVue software (Molecular Devices, USA) following immunohistochemistry staining.
Cells were quantified in a blinded manner by counting the number of CD41-immunopositive
cells in three areas of the cortex or striatum at 5 coronal levels. The mean was calculated
from the 6 fields and adjusted to express as mean number of cells/mm2 in the predefined brain
region. To further measure cell aggregation, the area of individual cells/cluster of cells was
calculated and categorized as small (2–5 cells), medium (5–10 cells), or large (>10 cells)15.
