Abstract 
Background:  Scutellarin, an anti-inflammatory agent, effectively suppressed microglia activation in rats with middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Robust microglia activation, acute in onset, was followed by astrogliosis. This study
was aimed to determine if scutellarin would also affect the reactive astrocytes that play an important role in tissue
repair. Expression of GFAP and Notch-1 and its members: Notch receptor intracellular domain (NICD), and transcrip‑
tion factor hairy and enhancer of split-1 (HES-1), together with nestin and proinflammatory mediators was assessed
by immunofluorescence staining in TNC1 astrocytes treated, respectively, with BV-2 conditioned medium (CM) and
CM + lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (CM + L) serving as the controls, and conditioned medium derived from LPS-activated
BV-2 cells pretreated with scutellarin (CM + SL). Study of the above biomarkers was then extended to reactive astro‑
cytes in scutellarin injected MCAO rats.
Results:  TNC1 astrocytes remained relatively unreactive in terms of expression of different biomarkers to direct
scutellarin treatment when compared with the control cells. In comparison to cells in the control medium (CM,
CM + L), they responded vigorously to CM + SL as evidenced by the enhanced protein expression of GFAP, Notch-1,
NICD and HES-1 coupled with that of nestin, TNF-α, IL-1β, and iNOS by Western and immunofluorescence analysis.
Electron microscopy showed marked hypertrophy and cell expansion of TNC1 astrocytes bearing many filamentous
processes indicative of enhanced astrocyte reaction when treated with CM + SL. In MCAO rats, scutellarin also aug‑
mented the expression of the above markers in reactive astrocytes; moreover, astrocytes were evidently hypertrophic.
Conclusions:  The results suggest that scutellarin regulates astrogliosis; more importantly, it is microglia-mediated as
demonstrated in vitro. Increased expression of Notch signaling in synchrony with nestin may be linked to proliferation
and “de-differentiation” of reactive astrocytes; the significance of enhanced TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS expression in reac‑
tive astrocytes by scutellarin may be neuroprotective but this remains speculative.

Background
Scutellarin (4,5,6-trihydroxyflavone-7-glucuronide) is the
major active component extracted from Erigeron breviscapus. It is a Chinese herbal compound endowed with
antioxidant and anti-inflammation properties [1–4]. In
the brain, scutellarin has been shown to decrease microglia inflammatory response [4]. In addition to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, scutellarin
has been demonstrated to have anti-apoptotic properties in animal models of ischemic stroke [3]. We reported
recently that scutellarin effectively suppressed production of proinflammatory mediators in activated microglia
in experimentally induced cerebral ischemia following
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in the adult
rats and in BV-2 microglia in  vitro [5, 6]. It was shown
that scutellarin decreased the production of proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-1β and reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activated microglia whose
robust reaction featured prominently in the acute phase
of cerebral ischemia. All this has pointed to the therapeutic potential of scutellarin and its clinical use for amelioration of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation.
While activated microglia evidently preponderated
in the ischemic cerebral tissue in the early phase of
MCAO [5, 6], massive astrocytes soon accumulated the
infarcted areas. Indeed cerebral ischemia leads to widespread progressive alterations in astrocytes, including
cell hypertrophy, upregulation of intermediate filaments
and increase in cell proliferation, commonly referred
to as reactive astrogliosis [7–11]. The close spatial relation between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes
in the ischemic area invites speculation that both glial
cells might work in concert through cellular interaction
or communication in the ensuing healing process. The
functional relationship between activated microglia and
reactive astrocytes, however, has remained to be fully
explored. In consideration of scutellarin as a potential
therapeutic agent, it is therefore desirable to determine if
it would also act on astrocytes as for activated microglia,
and if so, the mode of its action on astrocytes.
This study was therefore aimed to determine whether
scutellarin would exert its effects on astrocytes that
are closely associated with activated microglia. In
the latter, we have reported that expression of proinflammatory mediators and Notch-1 pathway and its
members was significantly suppressed by scutellarin.
It is relevant therefore to ascertain if these biomarkers
strongly expressed in reactive astrocytes would also be
affected. Secondly, if indeed scutellarin were able to affect
or regulate the astrocyte reaction, a compelling question
would be whether it would directly act on astrocytes, or
indirectly such as via activated microglia. In the latter, the
notion took into consideration of the reactive response of

microglia and astrocytes in temporal sequence [12, 13]
in cerebral ischemia, in which acute microglial activation
appears to precede that of astrocyte reaction; furthermore, both glial cells are spatially related. We report here
that scutellarin could enhance the expression of GFAP,
nestin, Notch-1 signaling and its members in TNC1
astrocytes as well as in reactive astrocytes in MCAO
rats. More strikingly, scutellarin was found to amplify the
expression of above-named biomarkers along with proinflammatory mediators, a process that is mediated by activated microglia as demonstrated in vitro.

Results
TNC1 viability assay with scutellarin

TNC1 astrocyte cell line instead of primary cultured
astrocytes was used for this study to ensure that we
obtained enough cells for adequate amounts of protein for Western blot analysis. The cytotoxicity data was
obtained by the MTS assay for the effect of scutellarin
on TNC1 cells. Scutellarin (in the range of 0.2–2.0 mM)
did not result in any significant cell death (Fig. 1a). In this
study, we have used scutellarin at 0.54  mM for all subsequent analysis. This dosage was used for treatment
of BV-2 cells also in our previous studies in which dose
dependent assay had earlier been done [5, 6].
Scutellarin does not exert a direct effect on TNC1

To determine if scutellarin would exert a direct effect
on TNC1, it was added directly into the medium with
TNC1. By phase contrast microscopy, the external morphology of TNC1 astrocytes incubated in the basic
medium + 0.54 mM scutellarin (BM + S) appeared comparable to that in the control cells in the basic medium
(BM). Furthermore, TNF-α (Fig. 1b: compared B1–3 with
A1–3) and iNOS (Additional file 1a) immunofluorescence
in BM  +  S remained relatively unaltered as compared
with the control cells incubated in BM. This indicates that
scutellarin does not stimulate TNC1 directly.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) does not exert a direct effect
on TNC1

By RT-PCR, TNF-α (Fig.  1c) and iNOS (Additional
file  1b) mRNA expression levels in TNC1 astrocytes
incubated in the basic medium (BM), BM  +  LPS
(BM  +  L) and BV-2 conditioned medium (CM) were
negligible. Remarkably, the mRNA expression levels were drastically increased by several hundred folds
when treated with LPS-stimulated BV-2 conditioned
medium (CM  +  L) (Fig.  1c; Additional file  1b). This
shows that TNC1 activation was only mildly elicited
and directly by LPS; instead, its vigorous activation is
mediated by activated microglia. TNF-α, IL-1β and
iNOS were used as markers for reactive astrocytes along

in TNF-α peaking at 24 h. Confocal images in d showing GFAP (C1–3), and TNF-α (D1–3) expression in TNC1 astrocytes incubated with different

with GFAP because these proinflammatory mediators
have been reported to be highly expressed in activated
astrocytes [14, 15].
TNC1 activation is mediated by activated microglia

Microglia-mediated activation of TNC1 astrocytes was
further evidenced by the drastic increase in GFAP (Fig. 1d:
C1–C3), TNF-α (Fig.  1d: D1–D3) and iNOS (Additional
file  1c: C1–C3) immunofluorescence in cells incubated
in CM  +  L compared with cells incubated in BM and
BM  +  L groups. Furthermore, TNC1 cells treated with
CM + L appeared evidently hypertrophic (Fig. 1d: C3, D3).

GFAP was moderately expressed in TNC1 incubated in
CM (a1, Fig.  2); it was enhanced in TNC1 treated with
CM  +  L (a2, Fig.  2). Notch-1, NICD, HES and nestin
expression was hardly detected in CM group (Fig.  2B1,
C1, D1, E1), but was enhanced in CM  +  L (b2, c2, d2,
e2). Remarkably, upon pretreatment with scutellarin in
CM  +  SL for 24  h, expression of all markers was drastically increased being more pronounced for NICD
(Fig. 2C3) and nestin (Fig. 2E3).

Morphological evidence of interaction between activated
microglia and reactive astrocytes

In TNC1 incubated in CM, the cells exhibited moderate
TNF-α expression (Fig.  2F1) which was augmented in
CM + L (F2). When treated with CM + SL, the expression was further enhanced (Fig.  2F3). A similar pattern
in expression changes was observed for IL-1β and iNOS
(Additional file  2). A striking morphological change in
TNC1 astrocytes treated with CM  +  SL was the extension of long cytoplasmic processes emanated from the
hypertrophic cell body (Fig. 2F3; Additional file 2B3). By
contrast, the cells in CM appeared more rounded, and
those in CM + L showed only a few short processes.

In rats subjected to MCAO, a large infarcted area was
observed in the ipsilateral cerebrum at early time-points.
By immunofluorescence labeling, the epicenter of the
infarcted area at 3 and 7 days after MCAO was occupied
by massive activated microglia labeled by lectin (Fig.  5).
On closer examination, the lectin labeled activated
microglia were mostly round with some cells emitted
short cytoplasmic processes (Fig.  5). At the border area
with the non-lesion cortex or adjacent to it (penumbral
area), activated microglia were admixed with GFAP positive astrocytes that appeared hypertrophic with long projecting and broad processes (Fig. 5); in some areas, both
glial cell types were closely associated or intermingled. In
non-lesion area, microglia and astrocytes appeared relatively normal both bearing fine processes; furthermore,
their close spatial relation as observed in the lesion zone
was not evident (Fig. 5).

Western blot analysis of GFAP, Notch‑1, NICD, HES‑1, TNF‑α,
IL‑1β and iNOS in TNC1 in different treatments

The expression level of GFAP (51  kDa), Notch-1
(120 kDa), NICD (80 kDa), and HES-1 (35 kDa) was significantly increased after treatment with CM  +  L when
compared with the control in CM (Fig.  3a); likewise, the
expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS was significantly
increased (Fig. 3b). In CM + SL treated TNC1, the expression levels of the above proteins were further elevated as
compared with that of CM  +  L treated cells. Expression
changes of the respective proteins are indicated against
the corresponding bar graphs (Fig. 3). The optical density
values (mean ± SD) of each marker are given in Table 1.
Electron microscopy

By scanning electronic microscopy, most TNC1 astrocytes in CM group were oblong; on closer examination, the surface projected some filamentous processes
(Fig.  4a). In CM  +  L group, the cells became hypertrophic bearing long extending processes (Fig. 4b) when
compared with cells in the CM group; the processes in
some cells were expanded (Fig.  4b). Most of the cells in
CM  +  SL group were grossly hypertrophic (Fig.  4c);
large numbers of filamentous processes projected from
the cell surface and appeared to intertwine with those
emanated from the adjacent cells (Fig.  4c). Most strikingly, TNC1 astrocytes in CM  +  SL spread out extensively and thinly giving them a “squamous” appearance.
In transmission electron microscopy, TNC1 astrocytes in
all three groups showed a round nucleus bearing one to
three conspicuous nucleoli (Fig.  4d). The copious cytoplasm in CM + SL group as compared with the other two
groups was filled with polyribosomes and the usual cell
organelles (Fig. 4d). Compared with other groups, cells in
CM + SL had a larger cell profile. Many long filamentous
processes projected from the cell surface as observed by
scanning electron microscopy.

Scutellarin enhanced astrocyte reaction in ischemic cortex

By immunofluorescence microscopy, robust astrocyte reaction was observed in the penumbral region in
ischemic cerebral cortex, notably at 7 and 14  days after
MCAO. MCAO induced astrocyte reaction was evidenced by the enhanced GFAP labeling coupled with
increased expression of Notch-1 (Fig. 6) and its members,
NICD (Fig. 7) and HES-1 (Fig. 8). A striking feature after
MCAO was the induced expression of nestin in GFAP
positive astrocytes (Fig. 9). Expression of TNF-α (Fig. 10),
IL-1β (Additional file 3) and iNOS (Additional file 4) was
concomitantly augmented.
In MCAO rats given scutellarin injections, astrocytic
reaction as manifested by the immunofluorescence of
the above-mentioned markers was further enhanced.
Astrocytes were grossly hypertrophic in comparison with the matching MCAO control rats without
scutellarin or sham group. Scutellarin further elevated
the MCAO-induced expression of Notch-1 (Fig.  6),
NICD (Fig.  7), HES-1 (Fig.  8) and nestin (Fig.  9). In
parallel to this, expression TNF-α (Fig.  10), IL-1β
(Additional file  3) and iNOS (Additional file  4) immunofluorescence in the reactive astrocytes also became
more pronounced. The enhanced increase for the above
biomarkers by scutellarin was progressive when compared with counterpart cells in the MCAO and sham
group being most pronounced at 7  days and was sustained till 14  days; thereafter, the expression appeared
to diminish but remained to be more intense when
compared with cells at the corresponding time-points
at 21 days (Additional file 5).

as compared with that of CM + L treated cells. Bar graphs represent expression changes of the respective markers. Significant differences in protein

Scutellarin not only accentuated the immunofluorescence of the various markers in reactive astrocytes,
but also induced the changes of their phenotype.
Thus, in MCAO rats given scutellarin treatment, the
cells were evidently enlarged bearing dilated processes

notably at 7 and 14 days (Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Additional
files 3, 4). GFAP labeled hypertrophic astrocytes often
extended their long processes between activated
microglia or encircled the outer walls of the blood
vessels (Fig. 5).

Discussion
Direct effects of scutellarin on microglia and astrocytes

We reported recently that scutellarin could suppress
NFkB and Notch signaling in activated microglia in their
production of proinflammatory mediators in MCAO rats
as well as in BV-2 cells [5, 6].This was sequel to our earlier demonstration that Notch-1 expression in activated
microglia could transactivate NFkB that is linked to production of proinflammatory mediators [16–18]. In light of
this, it was therefore concluded that scutellarin is a potential therapeutic agent that can attenuate microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in ischemic/hypoxic brain injury.
It is well documented that associated with the microglia
activation in ischemic injury, astrogliosis also featured
prominently [19, 20]. Indeed, following diverse brain
injuries, astrocytes are activated and described as reactive astrocytes [21–23]. Reactive astrocytes are known to
undergo proliferation and are involved in different functions such as scar formation and tissue repair among others [19, 24]. Scutellarin could reduce the infarct area in
rats with MCAO [5] indicating that it can promote tissue
repair in ischemic injury and, hence, exert its effects on
reactive astrocytes which play a pivotal role in this process. The purpose of this study was to ascertain if scutellarin would act on astrocytes, and if so, to determine its
mode of action. For this, we first investigated the effect
of scutellarin on TNC1 astrocytes in  vitro. As opposed
to BV-2 cells, direct application of scutellarin to TNC1
did not elicit an obvious increase in GFAP expression, a
specific marker for astrocytes; moreover, neither TNF-α
nor iNOS expression was noticeably altered. It stands to
reason therefore that scutellarin does not act directly, if
at all, on astrocytes. It was then surmised that scutellarin
might act through intermediary cells. A putative candidate for this would be the microglia whose activation in
the ischemic injury is acute in onset [25] and invariably
precedes that of astrocytes; furthermore, activated microglia and reactive astrocytes at the injury site are in close
proximity as is evident in the present MCAO model suggesting the possibility of their functional interaction.
Microglia mediate astrocyte reaction

In consideration of a possible interaction between
activated microglia and astrocytes, TNC1 astrocytes

were first exposed to basic medium (BM), or basic
medium  +  LPS (BM  +  L). Interestingly, GFAP, TNF-α
and iNOS expression between the two TNC1 groups was
moderate and comparable. This suggests that direct LPS
treatment did not evoke a noticeable response in TNC1
astrocytes. Against this however was the report that
LPS could activate the primary astrocytes bearing TLR4
[26]. The discrepancy in results may be attributed to different cell models used. Remarkably, when TNC1 astrocytes were exposed to conditioned medium derived from
LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells (CM + L), a vigorous response
was observed as manifested by the marked increased in
GFAP, TNF-α and iNOS expression. As a corollary, it is
suggested that the drastic TNC1 astrocyte reaction is
mediated by activated microglia.
Scutellarin amplifies microglia‑mediated astrocyte
reaction

The present results have shown that scutellarin is capable
of amplifying the astrocyte reaction. This notion lends its
support from the fact that GFAP, Notch-1, NICD, HES1, nestin expression along with that of TNF-α, IL-1β
and iNOS was noticeably increased in TNC1 astrocytes
exposed to CM  +  SL, when compared with cells incubated in CM + L. By Western blot, the increase was in the
range of 10–30 % of the expression levels across the various proteins. A similar increase in expression occurred
in reactive astrocytes in MCAO rats given scutellarin treatment. In this, the reactive astrocytes exhibited
more intense immunofluorescence of the above markers
compared with MCAO rats not treated with the drug.
Microglia-mediated astrocyte reaction is also evident by
an apparent hypertrophy of astrocytes bearing long filamentous processes and expansion of cells as revealed by
electron microscopy. The functional significance for the
phenotypic change is uncertain but it may promote communication between reactive astrocytes via the intertwined filamentous in tissue repair. In MCAO, the long
extending processes of reactive astrocytes were observed
to intercalate between activated microglia. The close
spatial relation between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes in the complex environment in ischemic
tissue may facilitate a paracrine function. Indeed, it was
reported that activated microglia through production

mation of TNC1 from oblong outline (CM, A1–2) to “squamous” appearance in the CM + SL (C1–2) whose cell surface exhibit a large number of
filamentous processes (arrows). By transmission electron microscopy (D1–3), TNC1 astrocytes in CM + SL are evidently enlarged (D3) as compared
with CM (D1) and CM + L (D2) groups; moreover, the cells contain a larger amount of cytoplasm rich in polyribosomes and usual organelles

of MCSF could stimulate astrocytes in their production
of proinflammatory cytokines [15] suggesting the functional relation or communication between two glial cell
types. Furthermore, it has been reported that the communication pathways among microglia, astrocytes and

neurons are responsible for neuroprotection [27]. Such
communication may be mediated by microglia ATP via
P2Y1 receptor on astrocyte which resulted in production
of IL-6 that provides neuroprotection. Crosstalk between
macrophages and astrocytes affecting the proliferation,

reactive phenotype and inflammatory response, suggesting a role during reactive gliosis following spinal cord
injury has recently been reported [28].
Scutellarin enhances GFAP, Notch‑1 pathway and nestin
expression in reactive astrocytes

Contrary to its suppression of microglia activation in
MCAO model and BV-2 cells, we show here that scutellarin instead promotes the astrocyte reaction as shown by
the enhanced expression of Notch-1, NICD and HES-1.
Additionally, scutellarin expanded the expression of nestin in virtually every reactive astrocyte both in vitro and

in  vivo. Reactive astrogliosis is reported to be involved
in tissue repair or scar formation. It is conceivable that
increase in hypertrophic astrocytic processes with
enhanced GFAP which constitutes the cytoskeleton or
intermediate filaments would facilitate such a function.
Furthermore, vascular profiles of varying sizes in the
penumbral region appeared to be fully invested by astrocytic end-feet suggesting that the integrity of the blood–
brain barrier which would have been compromised in
ischemia is being restored.
Nestin is a marker of neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells, and its expression is observed in a

subpopulation of reactive astrocytes [24, 29]. It is a class
VI intermediate filament protein that was first described
as a neural stem/progenitor cell marker [30]. Neuroepithelial stem cells can differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, and nestin has been shown
to be down-regulated or to completely disappear during
such differentiation. Here we showed that nestin which
was hardly detected in TNC1 was induced in some cells
in CM  +  L conditioned medium. In CM  +  SL treated
cells, nestin expression was detected and markedly
enhanced in all cells. Virtually all GFAP labeled reactive astrocytes in scutellarin injected MCAO rats emitted intense nestin immunofluorescence compared with
the matching control at the corresponding time-points.
The expression of nestin in reactive astrocytes suggests
that some of them had “de-differentiated” and assumed a
“stemness” property, but it remains to be determined if
they might differentiate [31]. While reactive astrocytes
appear to have greater plasticity than was previously
realized [32], and may provide a source of multipotent
cells or functional neurons for regenerative medicine,
the signaling pathway(s) that govern the formation of
injury-induced nestin positive reactive astrocytes having the potential of neural stem cells remains uncertain. Thus, the demonstration of Notch-1 signaling and
its members both in  vivo and in  vitro in this study may
provide a clue for the regulatory mechanism of nestin
expression in reactive astrocytes. It is relevant therefore
to note that proliferating reactive astrocytes are regulated by Notch-1 in the peri-infarct area after stroke [23].
It has been reported that treatment of MCAO mice with
DAPT, an inhibitor of γ secretase, decreases the number
of olig2+ and nestin+ reactive astrocytes [33] alluding to
the possibility that Notch-1 signaling in reactive astrocytes regulates nestin expression. The colocalization and
concurrent upregulation of Notch-1 signaling and nestin
in reactive astrocytes in the present results suggest that
both may operate in synergy; but in the lack of experimental evidence, this remains purely speculative. Other
pathways or molecules such as miRNAs known to regulate astrogliosis [34–36], and that might be involved in
microglia-mediated astrocyte reaction and modulated by
scutellarin should be future scope of study.

in reactive astrocytes by scutellarin remains speculative.
There is increasing agreement that TNF-α in  vitro and
in  vivo may protect neurons against excitotoxic, oxidative and ischemic injuries. It may be hypothesized that
TNF-α is not potent to kill neurons by itself, but it may
function synergistically with other cytokines and toxic
agents such as NO, free radicals or glutamate [38]. Likewise, IL-1β can promote survival of retinal ganglion cells
[39] and neurons [40]. Furthermore, it has been reported
that nitric oxide could induce the expression of GFAP in
reactive astrocytes which exhibit iNOS expression [41]. It
has been reported that iNOS-derived NO can act as an
endogenous antioxidant in traumatic brain injury suggesting the neuroprotective role of iNOS [42]. Taken
together, it is suggested that the increased expression of
TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS by scutellarin might not necessary be neurotoxic, but can be neuroprotective. It may
also be argued that the final result/amount of scutellarinregulated pro-inflammatory mediators would determine
whether they are neurotoxic or neuroprotective but this
remains debatable. From a speculative point of view,
TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS derived from reactive astrocytes
might be beneficial instead of cytotoxic as those from
activated microglia.

Scutellarin promotes TNF‑α, IL‑1β and iNOS in reactive
astrocytes

DI TNC1, type 1 phenotype of Rattus norvegicus astrocyte purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, USA, CRL-2005™) was maintained in 75  cm2
culture flasks with completed medium composed of basic
medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium, Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA; Cat. No. 1152) and supplement
with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone, Logan, UT,
USA). The cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under 5 % CO2.

While scutellarin decreases the expression of proinflammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS and NO
production in activated microglia, it conversely upregulates their expression in reactive astrocytes. It is well
documented that excess production of proinflammatory
mediators from activated microglia is detrimental to neurons [37]; on the other hand, their increased production

Conclusion
Scutellarin can regulate the expression of GFAP, Notch-1
signaling, and nestin along with that of proinflammatory
mediators in reactive astrocytes in ischemic injury. In
vitro results showed that scutellarin did not exert a direct
effect on astrocytes; rather, it acted through the intermediary activated microglia. Scutellarin acts primarily to
amplify the microglia-mediated astrocyte reaction thus
highlighting a functional “cross-talk” between activated
microglia and reactive astrocytes. On the other hand, the
specific molecules such as cytokines involved in this are
uncertain. Notwithstanding, it is concluded that scutellarin is a potent agent that can facilitate the communication between activated microglia and reactive astrocytes
in ischemic injury, an inter-glial cell mechanism that may
be crucial to issue repair.
Methods
Cell culture and in vitro study

Fang et al. BMC Neurosci (2015) 16:84

BV-2 cells (a widely used murine microglial cell line)
were maintained in our laboratory under the same condition as for TNC1 for the production of conditioned
medium.
Cell viability assay of TNC1 astrocytes

Cell viability was assessed by CellTiter 96  W Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega,
Fitchburg, WI, USA; Cat. No. G3580). To determine the
cytotoxic effect of scutellarin on TNC1, cells were plated
into 96-well microplates (104 cells/well) and cultured
for 24  h. They were subjected to treatment of scutellarin (in the range of 0.2–2.0  mM) in each well containing 100  μl of culture medium for 1  h in triplicates.
Briefly, 20  μl of MTS(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt) reagent was added to each well (final
concentration, 0.5 mg ml−1) and the plate was incubated
for an additional 4 h. The optical density (OD) was then
read at 490  nm using a microplate reader (GENIOS,
Tecan, Switzerland). The assays were performed in
triplicate.
Preparation and use of BV‑2 conditioned medium

At 24  h after BV-2 cell seeding, the medium was discarded. Three different kinds of conditioned medium
were prepared: BV-2 conditioned medium as control (CM): incubation of BV-2 cells was in 10  mL basic
DMEM for 3  h; BV-2 conditioned medium  +  lipopolycharride (LPS) (CM  +  L): BV-2 cells were incubated
with 10  mL basic medium with 1  µg/ml of LPS for 3  h;
BV-2 conditioned medium with scutellarin pretreatment  +  LPS (CM  +  SL): for this, BV-2 cells were first
incubated with 10 ml basic medium containing 0.54 mM
of scutellarin for 1 h. This dosage was used based on the
cell viability assay and the dose-dependency assay by us
previously [5, 6]; the medium was then discarded and the
cells were washed with PBS twice. Following this, 10 ml
basic medium containing 1  µg/ml of LPS was added for
another 3 h. All 3 conditioned media were collected and
filtered through 0.22  μm syringe filters; they were then
ready to use for treatment of TNC1 astrocytes.
TNC1 astrocytes and treatment with BV‑2 conditioned
medium

TNC1 astrocytes were divided into control (CM), LPSinduced (CM  +  L) and scutellarin  +  LPS (CM  +  SL)
groups based on treatment with the respective conditioned medium. TNC1 cells were seeded at a density of
3.0 × 105 in 6-well plates and 5.0 × 104 in 24-well plates,
incubated with a complete medium. After 24  h, the
medium was discarded and the cells were incubated with
2 ml (6-well plates) or 1 ml (24-well plates) of conditioned

Page 16 of 20

medium for 24 h. The cells were then harvested for protein extraction and RNA isolation (6-well plates) or
immunofluorescence microscopy (24-well plates).
RNA isolation and real‑time RT‑PCR for validation of TNCI
reaction

Total RNA from TNC1 astrocytes was extracted
using miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany, Cat. No.
217004) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After this, 1  μg of RNA from each sample was added
to a total volume of 20  μl reaction mixture containing 0.5  μg of oligo (dT) primer (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA; Cat. No. A3500), and 15U of AMV Reverse
Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA; Cat. No.
M5314). The reaction was initiated by incubating the
reaction mixture for 15  min at 42  °C, then heating at
95  °C for 5  min, and stopped by incubating at 0–5  °C
for 5  min. Aliquot (3  μl) of each of the diluted reverse
transcription products (diluted by 1:5) was added to the
10  μl reaction mixture containing 5  μl of GoTaq@qPCR
Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA; Cat. No.
A6001/2), 0.5  μM of each primer corresponding to
TNF-α, iNOS and β-actin, to amplify the genes in ABi
7900HT Fast PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA).
The primer sequences of TNF-α are forward: 5′-TATG
GCTCAGGGTCCAACTC-3′ and reverse: 5′-CTCCC
TTTGCAGAACTCAGG -3′, iNOS are forward: 5′- CT
CACTGGGACAGCA CAGAA -3′ and reverse: 5′- GCT
TGTCTCTGGGTCCTCTG-3′, β-actin are forward:
5′-AGCCATGTACGTAGCCATCC-3′
and
reverse:
5′-GCTGTGGTGGTGAAGCTGTA-3′. After pre-incubation at 95 °C for 15 min, the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed as follows: 40 cycles of denaturation at 94  °C for 15  s, annealing at 57  °C for 25  s, and
elongation at 72 °C for 15 s.
Western blotting analysis for DI TNC1 astrocytes

After incubating with different media for 24  h, TNC1
astrocytes of different groups (CM, CM  +  L and
CM  +  SL) were treated with lysis buffer after rinsing
twice with 1xPBS. Cell lysate was mechanically scrapped
off and centrifuged at 14,000  rpm for 15  min and the
supernatant was collected. Protein concentrations of
TNC1 astrocytes were determined with a colorimetric protein assay by protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA; Cat. No. 500-0002). Protein samples were
then heated with 6x protein loading buffer at 95  °C for
5 min to denature the protein. Thirty μg of each protein
sample was separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with 10  %
gels, in a Mini-Protein II apparatus (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).
Protein bands were electroblotted onto polyvinylindene
difluoride (PVDF) membrane and blocked with non-fat

dried milk for 1 h. The membranes were incubated with
TNF-α (rabbit polyclonal IgG 1:1500) (Sigma-Aldrich;
Cat. No. T8300), IL-1β (rabbit polyclonal IgG 1:500)
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. No. sc-7884), iNOS
(rabbit polyclonal IgG 1:1000) (Thermo scientific, Cat.

(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. No. sc-6014-R), NICD
(Rabbit polyclonal IgG 1:1000) (Merck KGaA, Cat. No.
07-1232), HES-1 (rabbit polyclonal IgG 1:300) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. No. sc-25392) and β-actin
(mouse monoclonal IgG 1:10000) (Sigma; Cat. No.
A5441). Primary antibodies (Table  2) diluted in TrisBuffered Saline-0.1  %Tween (TBST) overnight at 4  °C
before the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibodies, either with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (ThermoScientific; Cat. No. 31460),
or anti-mouse IgG (ThermoScientific; Cat. No. 31430).
Protein was detected by a chemiluminescence kit (GE
Healthcare UK Limited, Bucks, UK) following the manufacturer’s instructions and developed on film. The band
intensity was quantified in Image J software (National
Institutes of Health, NIH, USA). All experiments were
repeated at least in triplicate.
Immunofluorescence labeling of TNC1 in different
treatments

About 5  ×  104 TNC1 astrocytes were seeded on polyl-lysine (Sigma, Cat. NO. P4707) pre-coated coverslips
in a 24-well plate and left for 24  h to attach to the coverslip surface before various treatments. TNC1cells were
divided into 3 groups as described above: CM, CM + L
and CM  +  SL. After treatment with the conditioned
medium from the respective group for 24 h, TNC1 astrocytes were fixed in 4  % paraformaldehyde for 15  min at
room temperature followed by blocking with 5  % goat
serum for 1  h after washing with 1xPBS for 3 times at
5  min each. Subsequently the cells were incubated with
the respective primary antibodies (Table  2) diluted in
1xPBS (1:100–500) at 4  °C overnight. Antibodies were

detected with the relevant FITC/Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200, diluted by 1× PBS) for 1  h at
room temperature. The coverslips were then mounted
in DAPI containing the mounting medium (Sigma, Cat.
No. F6057) after rinsing in 1× PBS. Images were captured using a confocal microscope (FLUOVIEW FV1000;
Olympus, Japan).
Electron microscopy

For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TNC1 astrocytes from CM, CM + L and CM + SL were seeded on
cover-slips in a 24-well plate at 2 × 104/cm2. They were
fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde and 3 % glutaraldehyde in
0.1  M phosphate buffer at 4  °C for 1  h before postfixation with 1 % osmium tetroxide in PB, pH 7.4 for 30 min.
After rinsing in 0.1  M  PB, the cell samples were dehydrated through an ascending series of ethanol before
being transferred to a Bal-Tec CPD-030 critical point
dryer (Bal-Tec AG, Balzers, Liechtenstein), using liquefied carbon dioxide as the transition fluid. The cover slips
were then mounted on SEM stub. All cells were sputtercoated with 20 nm gold in a sputter coater (Balzers SCD
004) before examination in a scanning electron microscope (FEI 650 SEM).
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), TNC1
cells from the respective groups were fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde and 3  % glutaraldehyde in PB at 4  °C for
1  h before post-fixation with 1  % osmium tetroxide, pH
7.4 for 1 h. After dehydration, the cells were embedded in
resin which was allowed to polymerize at 60 °C for 24 h.
Ultrathin sections were mounted on formvar-coated copper grids and double stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate. The grids were viewed in a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope.

ethical guidelines as stated in the National Institutes of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals were strictly adhered to. All experimental protocols
and use of animals were approved by Kunming Medical
University (KMU), and all efforts were made to minimize
the number of rats used and their suffering.
Animals, surgical procedure, injection of scutellarin
and animal groups

A total of 65 adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing
250–280 g were obtained from the Experimental Animal
Center of Kunming Medical University. All surgical procedures were carried out in the Department of Anatomy
and Histology/Embryology, KMU. The surgical procedures for middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed that described previously by us [43, 44]. Briefly, the
animals were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). After this, a circular aperture 3 mm in diameter was burred in the right
parietal bone with a dental drill, and the main trunk of the
middle cerebral artery (MCA) exposed and cauterized.
In the sham-operated rats, the same surgical procedure
was followed but the MCA was not cauterized. All efforts
were made to minimize the number of rats used and their
suffering. The rats were randomly divided into shamoperated + saline (sham), MCAO + saline (MCAO), and
MCAO + scutellarin (100 mg/kg) (MCAO + scutellarin)
groups (Table  3). The rats in scutellarin treated groups
were given an intraperitoneal injection of scutellarin
(100 mg/kg dissolved in saline Cat. No.131021,Shanghai,
China) at 2 h before and at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h after
MCAO; rats were euthanized at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 21  days
after MCAO.
Double immunofluorescence labeling of MCAO brain
sections

The rats from the MCAO groups at different time-points
after scutellarin injections (n  =  5 for each time-point)
along with sham operated (n = 3 at each time point) and
MCAO  +  saline injection (n  =  5 for each time-point)
serving as the controls were used for double immunofluorescence labeling. Following deep anesthesia with 6  %
sodium pentobarbital, the rats were euthanized by perfusion with 2  % paraformaldehyde in 0.1  M phosphate
buffer. The brain was removed and paraffin embedded. Coronal sections of 7  μm thickness were cut on a

microtome (Model: 2165; Leica, Bensheim, Germany).
For blocking of nonspecific binding proteins, tissue sections were incubated in 5  % normal goat serum diluted
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature (22–24  °C). The sections were then incubated
in a humidified chamber with the following primary
antibodies against proinflammatory mediators: TNF-α
(rabbit polyclonal IgG1:100) (Chemicon International,
Temecula, CA, USA; Cat. No. AB1837P), IL-1β (rabbit polyclonal IgG 1:100) (Chemicon International; Cat.
No. AB1832P) and iNOS (mouse monoclonal IgG 1:100)
(BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA USA; Cat. No. 610432),
diluted with PBS overnight at 4 °C. Some sections were
incubated in primary antibodies directed against the
Notch signaling and its members including Notch-1
(rabbit polyclonal IgG 1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. No. sc-6014-R); intracellular Notch receptor
domain, NICD (Rabbit polyclonal IgG 1:200) (Merck
KGaA, Cat. No. 07-1232); transcription factor hairy
and enhancer of split-1, HES-1 (rabbit polyclonal IgG
1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. No.sc-25392)
diluted in PBS overnight at 4  °C. Following washing in
PBS, sections were incubated, with the respective fluorescent secondary antibodies: Cy3-conjugatedsecondary
antibody or FITC-conjugated lectin (Lycopersicon esculentum), which labels both microglia and blood vessel endothelial cells for 1  h at room temperature. Brain
sections from different groups were also incubated with
the primary antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a specific marker for astrocytes (Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Cat. No. MAB360), and
nestin, a marker for neural stem cells (Sigma-Aldrich,
MO, USA, Cat. No. SAB4200347). After three rinses
with PBS, the sections were mounted with a fluorescent
mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma, MO, USA; Cat. No. F6057).
Colocalization was observed by confocal microscopy
(Fluoview1000, Olympus Company Pte. Ltd., Tokyo,
Japan). The details of the antibodies used are given in
Table  2. The region for all staining tests in MCAO rats
was at the border areas of the infarct epicenter of ipsilateral ischemic cerebral cortex.
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 16.0 statistical software. The data were expressed as mean  ±  SD.
After homogeneity test of variances, one-way Analysis
of Variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparison
of Dunnet’s test was used to determine the statistical significance of different groups. All experiments were conducted in triplicate from different cell or tissue samples.
The difference was considered statistically significant
when P <0.05.
