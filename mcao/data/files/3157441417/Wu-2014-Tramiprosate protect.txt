Tramiprosate, a small aminosulphonate compound, is present in various species of red marine algae. In
this study, we examined whether tramiprosate protects neurons and improves functional recovery
following ischemic stroke in rats subjected to the intraluminal ﬁlament model of MCAO and further
explored the underlying mechanisms. Tramiprosate dose-dependently reduced the infarct volume after
MCAO, and the therapeutic time window of tramiprosate (50 mg/kg) for cerebral ischemia was at least
6 h. Moreover, functional assays and histochemical staining were performed. Signiﬁcant neurological
functional recovery was found after tramiprosate (50 mg/kg) administration in all three functional assays
performed (modiﬁed neurological severity score, foot-fault test and adhesive-removal somatosensory
test). Tramiprosate signiﬁcantly attenuated OGD- or NMDA-induced injury in NGF-differentiated PC12
cells and primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of tramiprosate was partially
blunted by the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK801 both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that
tramiprosate might confer neuroprotection against stroke via the NMDAR. Based on coimmunoprecipitation and western blotting, tramiprosate decreased the intensity of the association between nNOS and PSD95, and tramiprosate also inhibited the translocation of nNOS from the cytosol to
the membrane without affecting the total nNOS expression level both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion,
tramiprosate dose-dependently provides neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo against ischemic stroke, and
the neuroprotective effect of tramiprosate may be partially attributed to disruption of the interaction
between PSD95 and nNOS and inhibition of nNOS translocation.

1. Introduction
Stroke is deﬁned as the sudden loss of brain function resulting
from interference with the blood supply to the central nervous
system (CNS). More than 5 million people die and another 5 million
are disabled by stroke worldwide annually (Yang et al., 2012). Up to
85% of all strokes are events of cerebral ischemia. Despite its
prevalence and severe consequences, there are few effective
treatments available for ischemic stroke (Jaffer et al., 2011).
Therefore, protection against ischemic stroke remains a great
challenge. There is an urgent need to identify safe and effective
treatments for ischemic stroke.

Tramiprosate (homotaurine, 3-amino-1-propane sulphonic
acid), a small aminosulphonate compound, is present in various
species of red marine algae. It has been proven to possess a wide
range of effects, including neuroprotection, anticonvulsion and
antihypertension, and has also been used as an effective treatment
for alcoholism (Bousquet et al., 1981; Caltagirone et al., 2012;
Fariello et al., 1982). Moreover, post-hoc analyses after a failed
Phase III clinical study of AD demonstrated positive and signiﬁcant
effects of tramiprosate on secondary endpoints and subgroups of
patients, including a reduction in hippocampal volume loss and a
reduced decline in memory function (Caltagirone et al., 2012). In
addition, tramiprosate has been reported in clinical studies as a
candidate molecule for cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Greenberg
et al., 2006). However, to the best of our knowledge, the effects of
tramiprosate on ischemia-induced brain damage and deﬁcits in
neurological function have not been characterised.

Numerous mechanisms have been implicated in ischemic
neuronal injury, such as excitotoxicity, ionic imbalance and oxidative stress, among others (Dirnagl et al., 1999; Lo et al., 2003).
Among these mechanisms, Ca2þ overload plays an important role in
the pathogenesis of ischemic neural damage. Ca2þ inﬂux through
NMDARs stimulates NO production by activating neuronal nitric
oxide synthase (nNOS), resulting in exacerbated neuronal injury
(Christopherson et al., 1999; Keynes and Garthwaite, 2004). However, directly inhibiting NMDARs and nNOS can cause severe side
effects by interfering with physiological functions in the CNS.
The scaffolding protein postsynaptic density-95 (PSD95) binds
to both NMDARs and nNOS at excitatory synapses and assembles
them into a macromolecular signalling complex. NMDAR activation
provokes nNOS translocation from the cytosol to the membrane
and to the association of nNOS with NMDAR via PSD95 (Fan et al.,
2010; Hu et al., 2013). This NMDA-PSD95-nNOS complex plays a
central role in mediating glutamatergic excitotoxicity, which results
in brain damage during the acute post-stroke period. Moreover, it
has been reported that this complex has shown promise as a potential drug target that limits ischemic injury and widens the
therapeutic window for the treatment of stroke (Flemming, 2012;
Zhou et al., 2010). Furthermore, disrupting the ischemia-induced
interaction between nNOS and PSD95 may represent a strategy to
treat stroke that avoids the undesirable effects of directly inhibiting
nNOS activity (Zhou et al., 2010).
In the present study, we focused on investigating the neuroprotective effect of tramiprosate and its inﬂuence on the PSD95e
nNOS complex. Thus, we ﬁrst examined whether tramiprosate
treatment can protect neurons against ischemic stroke by
measuring its dose-dependent effects, the therapeutic time window and the improvement in functional recovery following the
intraluminal ﬁlament model of MCAO in rats. Then, we determined
whether tramiprosate treatment concentration-dependently
reduced OGD- or NMDA-induced injury in NGF-differentiated
PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons. In addition, we examined whether the effect of tramiprosate is associated with disrupting the PSD95enNOS complex and inhibiting the translocation
of nNOS from the cytosol to the membrane both in vitro and in vivo.

were returned to their cage at room temperature 24  1  C. Sham-operated animals
were subjected to the same procedure described above without MCAO.
2.3. Animal experimental protocols and drug application
Tramiprosate (Aldrich Sigma product) was dissolved in normal saline and
administered i.p. All of the assays were performed by investigators who were blind
to the treatment to which the animals were subjected.
To observe the dose-dependent effect of tramiprosate, forty rats were randomly
separated into ﬁve groups, and each group was injected with vehicle (equivalent
dose of 0.9% saline administered i.p.) or 50, 25, 12.5 or 6.25 mg/kg of tramiprosate,
respectively, at 4 h after MCAO. To determine the therapeutic window of tramiprosate administration in rats, forty rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups, which
were treated with vehicle (equivalent dose of 0.9% saline administered i.p.) or tramiprosate (50 mg/kg) at 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, or 8 h, respectively, after MCAO. To elucidate
the improvement in neurological function after ischemic stroke in rats, the rats
(n ¼ 8 per group) underwent neurobehavioral assays to evaluate the functional
outcome after administration of tramiprosate (50 mg/kg) 4 h after MCAO. The
neurological deﬁcits were assessed at 0 and 4 h and 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 days after
MCAO. To investigate the blunting effects of an NMDA receptor antagonist on tramiprosate efﬁcacy, MK801 (1 mg/kg, Aldrich Sigma product) was injected i.p. 5 min
prior to the administration of tramiprosate. In addition, animals treated with an
equivalent dose of vehicle or tramiprosate (50 mg/kg, i.p.) 4 h after MCAO were used
as controls. For other observations, including co-immunoprecipitation and Western
blot analysis, rats were randomly separated into three groups: sham-operated,
vehicle, and tramiprosate (n ¼ 6 per group). The tramiprosate group was injected
with tramiprosate (50 mg/kg) 4 h after MCAO.
2.4. TTC assessment of infarct size
For infarct volume analysis, rats were anesthetized and killed by decapitation
22 h after reperfusion. Their brains were quickly isolated, cut into consecutive 2mm-thick coronal slices, and incubated in 1% TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride) (Sigma) solution at 37  C for 15 min and incubated for another 15 min
after reversal of the slices. After the end of staining, color images of these slices were
captured using a scanner. All brain slices of each experimental animal were analysed
for the infarct volume using the Image-Pro Plus 6. Percent-age infarct volume was
evaluated as described by [(VC  VL)/VC]  100, where VC is the volume of control
hemisphere, VL is the volume of non-infarcted tissue in the lesioned hemisphere
(Swanson et al., 1990; Wang et al., 2007).
2.5. Functional assessments
Animals were trained prior to MCAO (training period: 3 trials per day for 3 days),
and functional deﬁcits were assessed 0 and 4 h and 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 days after
MCAO. The order of the assays (neurological severity score (NSS), foot-fault test,
adhesive-removal somatosensory test) was always the same to maintain identical
testing conditions for all animals. All of the tests were performed by investigators
blind to the treatment of the animals.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental animals
Adult male SpragueeDawley rats (weighing 200e250 g, Wuhan University
Laboratory Animal Center) were housed on a 12 h lightedark cycle at 25  2  C, and
in a relative humidity of 60e80%. Animals were fed on a diet of standard pellets and
water. The animals were allowed to acclimate to the housing conditions for 5 days
prior to experimentation. Animal study followed ARRIVE (Animal Research:
Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines and was approved by The Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Wuhan University Center for Animal
Experiment, Wuhan, China (AUP No. S01313013E).

2.2. Animals model of cerebral ischemia
Rats were fasted but were provided access to water ad libitum overnight before
the induction of cerebral ischemia. The rats were randomly separated into groups.
The rats were anaesthetised using chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg intraperitoneally
(i.p.)) and subjected to MCAO as described previously (Cheyuo et al., 2011; Sun et al.,
2012), with minor modiﬁcations. In brief, we surgically exposed the left common
carotid artery, the internal carotid artery, and the external carotid artery. A 4-0 nylon
monoﬁlament suture (Beijing Sha Dong Biotech Co Ltd) with a rounded tip was
inserted into the internal carotid artery through the external carotid artery stump
and gently advanced to occlude the MCA. After 2 h of MCAO, reperfusion was
accomplished by withdrawing the nylon suture. Laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (Periﬂux
System 5010; Perimed, Sweden) was performed to monitor the regional cerebral
blood ﬂow (CBF) to determine the MCAO severity during the surgical procedure and
upon reperfusion. A >80% decline in relative CBF conﬁrmed an interruption of the
CBF in the MCA. A return to >70% of basal CBF within 10 min of suture withdrawal
conﬁrmed a reperfusion of the MCA territory. The body temperature was maintained
between 36.5  C and 37.5  C using a rectal temperature probe and a heating pad
(Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). After recovery from anaesthesia, the animals

2.5.1. Modiﬁed neurological severity score (mNSS)
The mNSS is a composite of motor (muscle status and abnormal movement),
sensory (visual, tactile and proprioceptive senses), reﬂex and balance assessments.
Neurological function was graded on a scale of 0e18: normal score, 0; maximal
deﬁcit score, 18. For the severity of injury scores, the inability to perform the test or
the lack of a tested reﬂex was scored as 1 (Chen et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2005).
2.5.2. Foot-fault test
The rats were tested for placement dysfunction of the forelimbs using the footfault test. The animals were placed on an elevated grid ﬂoor (45  30 cm) containing
2.5  2.5-cm diameter openings 2.5 cm above the solid base ﬂoor. The animals tend
to move on the grid with their paws placed on the wire frame. When the animals
inaccurately place a limb, the limb falls through one of the openings in the grid.
When the limb falls through and pulls back quickly without touching the solid base,
the step is deﬁned as a half fault and counted as a foot-fault score of 1. If the limb falls
through and touches the base for support, the step is deﬁned as a full fault and
counted as a foot-fault score of 2. Both the foot-fault scores and the total number of
steps of both forelimbs in a trial were measured. If the total number of steps is less
than 40 steps, the trial is not eligible and it need repeating. The asymmetry score was
calculated by subtracting the percentage of ipsilateral forelimb faults from the
percentage of contralateral forelimb faults (Barth et al., 1990; Hernandez and
Schallert, 1988; Shehadah et al., 2010).
2.5.3. Adhesive-removal somatosensory test
The somatosensory deﬁcit was measured (Shen et al., 2006) both before and
after MCAO. Two small pieces of adhesive-backed paper dots (100 mm2) were used
as bilateral tactile stimuli occupying the distal-radial region on the wrist of each
forelimb. The rat was then returned to its home-cage. The time to remove each piece
from the limb was recorded for ﬁve trials per day before MCAO and 4 h and 1, 3, 5, 7,

S. Wu et al. / Neuropharmacology 83 (2014) 107e117
9, 11, and 14 days after MCAO. Individual trials were separated by at least 5 min. Once
the rats were able to remove the dots within 10 s, they were subjected to MCAO.

109

solution was added and absorbance was taken at 520 nm wavelength (Flex Station
microplate reader). The NO concentrations in sample were determined using the
standard nitrite reference curve and expressed as mmol/l.

2.6. Histological, immunohistochemical
At 14 days after MCAO, animals were sacriﬁced and brains were ﬁxed by
transcardial perfusion with saline, followed by perfusion and immersion in 4%
paraformaldehyde before being embedded in parafﬁn. A standard parafﬁn block was
obtained from the center of the lesion (bregma 1 mm to þ1 mm). A series of 4-mmthick sections were cut from the block. Every 10th coronal section for a total 5
sections was used for histological and immunohistochemical assessment. One section was treated with Nissl staining for histological assessment of damage. To detect
spatial distribution of stroke caused DNA fragmentation, a terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated uridine 50 -triphosphate-biotin nick end
labelling (TUNEL) staining protocol was employed with minor modiﬁcations (Li
et al., 2012). Antibody against cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining was performed
(Li et al., 1998).
The Nissl staining, cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL immunostained coronal section
was digitized using a 40 objective, via microscope. Five brain ﬁelds within each
section were acquired and the total number of neuronal cells on Nissl staining,
cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL-positive cells in the aperi-infarct region of the cortex
were counted using the Image-Pro plus. The total number of positive cells per mm2
area is presented.

2.12. Measurements of intracellular Ca2þ concentration ([Ca2þ]i)
The [Ca2þ]i concentrations in OGD- or NMDA-treated primary cortical neurons
or PC12 cells were determined using the ﬂuorescent Ca2þ indicator Fura-2-AM
(Lenart et al., 2004). The cells were loaded with Fura-2-AM (ﬁnal concentration
5 mmol/L), 0.1% DMSO and 1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature in the dark and
then placed in an incubator for 45 min at 37  C. The ﬂuorescence measurements
were performed using a ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer. The Fura-2-AM-loaded
cells were exposed sequentially to excitation wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm,
and the emission signal at a wavelength of 510 nm was recorded. The ﬂuorescence
intensities were converted to calcium concentrations using the following equation:
[Ca2þ]i ¼ Kd  [(R  Rmin)/(Rmax  R)]  b, where Kd was 224 nmol/L, R(F340/F380)
was the ﬂuorescence intensity; Rmax was determined by adding Triton X-100 (ﬁnal
concentration of 0.1%); Rmin was determined by adding EGTA (ﬁnal concentration of
5 mmol/L); and b is the ratio of the 385 nm ﬂuorescence intensity of Rmin to that of
Rmax (Larsen et al., 2007).

2.13. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)
2.7. Cell culture
PC12 cells (China Centre for Type Culture Collection, Wuhan, China) were seeded
on 25-cm2 polystyrene ﬂasks in high-glucose DMEM (Gibco, USA) containing 10%
foetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA). The cells were incubated under an atmosphere of
95% air and 5% CO2. Cell cultures were passaged every 6 days and differentiated for 3
days by adding 50 ng/mL of NGF prior to each experiment. PC-12 cells were seeded
at a density of 1  105 cells/mL on 24-well or 6-well plates.
Cortical neurons were prepared from 18-day SD rat embryos as described previously, with some modiﬁcations (Zhang et al., 2013). After the brain was removed
from the embryo, the meninges were removed, and the prefrontal cortex was
dissected, which was digested using 0.2% trypsin for 20 min. The cells were seeded
on either 24-well or 6-well plates in high-glucose DMEM containing 10% foetal
bovine serum at a density of 2500 cells/mm2, and the media was changed to serumfree Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 and 0.5 mM glutamine (Invitrogen) 24 h later. The cells were maintained at 37  C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere
containing 95% air and 5% CO2 and were used for experimentation after 7e9 days
in vitro (DIV).
2.8. In vitro ischemiaereperfusion injury model of oxygeneglucose deprivation
(OGD)
The OGD model was performed as described previously (Hu et al., 2013; Liu
et al., 2008; Mang et al., 2013). The primary cortical neurons or PC12 cells were
cultured in 24-well or 6-well plates. The cells were treated with vehicle (distilled
water) or tramiprosate at 200, 40, 8 and 1.6 mg/mL for 1 h. Then, the cells were
incubated (for 1 h in PC12 cells and 30 min in primary cortical neurons) in glucosefree Earle’s balanced salt solution (EBSS) containing 10 mM sodium dithionite
(Na2S2O4), a deoxygenated reagent, after rinsing three times with glucose-free EBSS.
The culture media was then replaced with DMEM after washing two times with
glucose-containing EBSS, and the cells were incubated for 24 h.

The co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (Tu et al.,
2010; Zhou et al., 2010) with brief modiﬁcation. Another set of rats were killed at
24 h after MCAO and brain tissue were extracted from the ipsilateral ischemic area.
The primary cortical neurons or PC12 cells were treated vehicle or tramiprosate, and
washed twice with cold PBS at 24 h after the challenge with NMDA. Both the brain
tissue and cells were lysed in an ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, China). The
lysates were centrifuged at 12,000  g for 10 min at 4  C. Protein concentration in
the supernatants was determined by BCA assay (Beyotime, China). The protein
(1 mg) were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-PSD95 (6 mg; Santa Cruz) for
12 h at 4  C with gentle rotation, followed by the addition of 30 mL of protein A/G
plus-agarose (Santa Cruz) for another 12 h at 4  C with gentle rotation. The beads
were washed three times with PBS and then denatured with a sample loading buffer.
Proteins were used for western blot analysis.

2.14. Western-blot analysis
Equal amounts of protein were subjected to Western blot analysis as previously
described (Chen et al., 2003). The proteins in the samples were separated via sodium
dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). As much as 30 mg
of protein were separated via SDS-PAGE, and molecular weight markers were loaded
on each gel to determine the molecular weight of each protein. The proteins on the
gel were subsequently transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was then
probed using a polyclonal rabbit anti-nNOS (1:100, Santa Cruz), monoclonal mouse
anti-PSD95 (1:200, Santa Cruz), or polyclonal rabbit anti-b-actin (1:200, Santa Cruz)
antibody at 4  C overnight. After three washes with PBST, the membranes were
incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000,
Santa Cruz) for 2 h. The membranes were washed again, and then, the chemiluminescence signal was visualised using X-ray ﬁlm. The protein expression levels
were determined using Quantity One software.

2.9. In vitro excitotoxicity model of NMDA injury
NMDA injury was performed according to a previously reported method (Song
et al., 2006; Tian et al., 2012), with slight modiﬁcations. The cells were treated with
vehicle (distilled water), tramiprosate at 200, 40, 8 and 1.6 mg/mL or tramiprosate at
40 mg/mL in the absence or presence of MK801 (10 mM) for 1 h. Then, PC12 cells were
treated with NMDA (500 mM) in the same buffer for 4 h followed by 24 h a recovery.
For primary cortical neurons, NMDA (50 mM) was added to the medium for 30 min
followed by 24 h a recovery.
2.10. Lactate dehydrogenase assay
The activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released to the culture media, as an
index of neuronal injury, was measured at 24 h after the challenge with OGD or
NMDA under 490 nm by a Flex Station 3 micro-plate reader (Molecular Devices)
using the Cytotox 96 kits (Promega) as previously described (Tabakman et al., 2002).
Brieﬂy, the medium (50 ml) was transferred to 96-well plates, mixed with 50 ml of
reaction solution in kits and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Stop solution in kits was then added and the optical density was measured.

2.15. Determination of the membrane translocation of nNOS
The extraction of membrane protein fractions of brain tissue, cortical neurons or
PC12 was performed using the Nuclear-Cytosol-Mem Extractionkit (Applygen).
Brain tissue and cells was lysed at room temperature using a cell lysis buffer.
Membrane proteins were solubilized on ice with a membrane solubilization buffer
diluted at a ratio of 2:1 with detergent dilution buffer. The solubilized mixture was
centrifuged at 700 g for 10 min at 4  C to remove cellular debris, and the clariﬁed
supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4  C to separate membrane
and hydrophilic protein fractions. Phase partitioning resulted in the hydrophilic
cytosol proteins layering at the top and the hydrophobic membrane proteins
layering at the bottom. The membrane protein fraction was normalized to the volume of the cytosol protein fraction using the diluted buffer. The fractions were
further diluted 2-fold with diluted reagent. The isolated protein fractions were
analysed by western blot. b-actin, a cytosol protein, was measured by western blot to
evaluate the purity of membrane protein fractions and no b-actin was detected (data
not shown), which excluded the possibility of contamination by cytosol proteins.

2.11. Measurement of NO level
The NO level was estimated at 24 h after the challenge with OGD or NMDA by
Griess reagent method. In brief, cells were treated as described in Section 2.9 or 2.10.
Volume of 100 ml of medium was transferred to 96-well plates and sulfanilamide
solution was added. After incubation, N-1-naphtylethylenediamine dihydrochloride

2.16. Statistical analysis
The data were expressed as the means  SD. Statistical analysis was performed
using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student’s t-test with a
Bonferroni correction. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results
3.1. Dose-dependent effect of tramiprosate
To determine the dose-dependent effect of tramiprosate against
ischemic stroke, rats were treated with various doses of tramiprosate 4 h after MCAO. The brain infarct volume was evaluated at
24 h after MCAO (Fig. 1). The infarct volume of the vehicle group
(Fig. 1A, column 1, white region) was 33.3%  5.2%, while the infarct
volume of the tramiprosate (50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 mg/kg)-treated
groups was signiﬁcantly decreased to 9.6%  2.6%, 13.5%  2.7%,
15.7%  4.0% and 23.6%  6.7%, respectively (p < 0.05; p < 0.01).
This result suggests that tramiprosate may dose-dependently
attenuate cerebral ischemic injury in rats.
3.2. The therapeutic time window of tramiprosate
To elucidate the therapeutic time window of tramiprosate, we
measured the brain infarct volume of rats treated with tramiprosate 2, 4, 6 or 8 h after MCAO (Fig. 2). The infarct volume of the
vehicle group was 30.3%  2.3%, while the infarct volume of the
tramiprosate (50 mg/kg) groups treated at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after

MCAO signiﬁcantly decreased to 5.7%  4.6%, 8.9%  3.2%,
12.2%  2.9% and 24.0%  5.2%, respectively. This result suggests
that the therapeutic time window of tramiprosate (50 mg/kg) for
cerebral ischemia is up to 6 h after MCAO.
3.3. Neurological functional outcome
To examine whether tramiprosate treatment regulated functional outcome, a battery of functional tests was performed. No
signiﬁcant differences in the results of the behavioural tests were
detected between the groups prior to MCAO. All of the rats subjected to MCAO exhibited a progressive decrease in behavioural
deﬁcits over time until 14 days after surgery. The neurological
deﬁcits were equivalent between the tramiprosate treatment group
and the MCAO control group at the time in which tramiprosate
treatment was initiated, 4 h after MCAO. Based on the mNSS scores,
the tramiprosate treatment group displayed signiﬁcantly lower
mNSS scores than MCAO the control group at 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14
days after MCAO (p < 0.05; p < 0.01, Fig. 3A). The tramiprosate
treatment group also performed much better on the foot-fault test
at 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 days after MCAO (p < 0.05, Fig. 3B). The results
of the adhesive-removal somatosensory test also revealed that

tramiprosate treatment signiﬁcantly improved the somatosensory
deﬁcits at 5, 7, 9, 11, and 14 days after MCAO (p < 0.05, Fig. 3C).
These results suggest that tramiprosate induces functional recovery
in rats after ischemic stroke.
3.4. Effect of tramiprosate on neuronal apoptosis and loss
To determine whether tramiprosate (50 mg/kg) treatment
regulated apoptosis, two apoptosis markers, TUNEL and cleaved

caspase-3, were used. The results revealed that tramiprosate
treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive
cells in the peri-infarct region of cortex, as well as the number of
cleaved caspase-3-positive cells, compared to MCAO alone, as
shown in Fig. 4A and B (p < 0.05). Nissl staining was performed to
investigate neuronal loss in the peri-infarct region of cortex, and
representative photographs are shown in Fig. 4C. The number of
Nissl-stained neurons was greatly reduced after MCAO (P < 0.01)
and recovered with tramiprosate treatment (P < 0.05).

signiﬁcantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells (A), the extent of cleaved caspase-3 expression (B) and increased the number of neurons (C) in the ischemic brain
compared to vehicle treatment. All data were expressed as the means  SD (n ¼ 8). #P < 0.05 versus sham; ##p < 0.05 versus sham; *p < 0.05 versus vehicle, **p < 0.01 versus

3.5. Tramiprosate concentration-dependently reduced OGD- or
NMDA-induced injury
We further examined whether the effect of tramiprosate using
the OGD model in both NGF-differentiated PC12 cells and primary
cortical neurons. The extent of cellular injury was evaluated by
measuring LDH release, NO production and [Ca2þ]i. As shown in
Fig. 5A, tramiprosate (200, 40 or 8 mg/mL) signiﬁcantly decreased
LDH release, a marker of cell membrane damage, in media
compared to vehicle treatment. Simultaneously, we investigated
the effect of tramiprosate on NO production. Administration of
tramiprosate (200, 40, or 8 mg/mL) resulted in a signiﬁcant
(P < 0.05) decrease in the NO levels compared to administration of
vehicle (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, performance of OGD in PC12
cells result in an increase in [Ca2þ]i. However, tramiprosate reduced
the increase. Moreover, we examined the effect of tramiprosate on
NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. The results revealed that

tramiprosate concentration-dependently suppressed the increase
in LDH release, NO production and [Ca2þ]i in both NGFdifferentiated PC12 cells and cultured cortical neurons (Fig. 5DeF).
3.6. Blunting effects of an NMDA antagonist on the efﬁcacy of
tramiprosate
To evaluate whether the neuroprotection of tramiprosate was
mediated by the activation of the NMDA receptor, we applied the
non-subunit-speciﬁc NMDA receptor antagonist MK801 (1 mg/kg)
4 h after MCAO. As expected, the application of tramiprosate
resulted in a remarkable reduction in the total infarct volume.
However, the effect of tramiprosate was virtually abolished by coadministration of MK-801 (Fig. 6A, P < 0.01). In contrast, we
found that treatment with MK-801 4 h after MCAO did not provide
any detectable neuroprotection, which was in line with previous
reports (Liu et al., 2007; Margaill et al., 1996). Alternatively, both

PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons were treated with tramiprosate (40 mg/mL) for 1 h in the absence or presence of MK801
(10 mM). Tramiprosate signiﬁcantly reduced the LDH release
induced by the subsequent application of NMDA (p < 0.05
compared to NMDA treatment alone) (Fig. 6B). This effect of tramiprosate was mediated by NMDA receptors because the neuroprotective effects of tramiprosate were prevented by MK801cotreatment.

3.7. Effect of tramiprosate on the PSD95enNOS complex
Because the effects of tramiprosate against stroke might be
linked to the NMDA signalling pathway, we determined whether
disruption of the neuronal death-signalling complex, the NR2BPSD95enNOS complex, could contribute to the neuroprotective
effect of tramiprosate. First, proteins were immunoprecipitated
using an antibody speciﬁc to PSD95. The results revealed that the
amount of nNOS that immunoprecipitated with PSD95 was significantly increased in rats following MCAO or in cells following
exposure to NMDA. However, tramiprosate treatment signiﬁcantly
reversed these increases, indicating that tramiprosate treatment
signiﬁcantly lowered the intensity of the association between nNOS
and PSD95 (Fig. 7AeC). In addition, another set of co-IP experiments was performed to investigate the inﬂuence of tramiprosate
on the PSD95-nNOS interaction in the cell membrane fraction, and
tramiprosate signiﬁcantly lowered the intensity of nNOS related to
PSD95 in the cell membrane fraction (Fig. 7DeF).

3.8. Effects of tramiprosate on the translocation of nNOS from the
cytosol to the membrane
To further conﬁrm the above ﬁndings, the expression level of
total nNOS was measured. The results revealed that tramiprosate
did not inﬂuence the total nNOS level (Fig. 8A, D), which excluded
the possibility that tramiprosate inhibits the interaction between
PSD95 and nNOS by reducing the total nNOS expression level.
Because NO production might be caused by the translocation of
nNOS from the cytosol to the membrane (Arundine et al., 2003;
Zhou et al., 2010), the localisation of nNOS to the membrane and
the cytosol of neurons was measured. The results revealed tramiprosate signiﬁcantly decreased the abundance of nNOS in the
membrane (Fig. 8B, E), increased the abundance of nNOS in the
cytosolic fractions (Fig. 8C, F), displayed no effect on the total level
of nNOS (Fig. 8A, D). Thus, tramiprosate may prevent the ischemic
stroke-induced translocation of nNOS.

4. Discussion
To our knowledge, this study reports for the ﬁrst time that: 1)
tramiprosate dose-dependently reduces the infarct volume after
MCAO, and the therapeutic time window of tramiprosate (50 mg/
kg) for cerebral ischemia is up to 6 h after MCAO; 2) tramiprosate
confers functional recovery of rats following ischemic stroke; 3)
tramiprosate reduces OGD- or NMDA-induced injury in NGFdifferentiated PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons; and 4)

tramiprosate treatment also markedly disrupts the interaction between PSD95 and nNOS and inhibits the translocation of nNOS
from the cytosol to the membrane.
Tramiprosate, a nutraceutical currently used for memory protection, has a wide range of pharmacological applications. It has
been demonstrated that tramiprosate reduces the voluntary intake
of ethanol, leads to a dose-related decrease in blood pressure and
protects against the cytotoxic effect of systemically administered
kainic acid (Bousquet et al., 1981; Fariello et al., 1982; Olive et al.,
2002). Moreover, tramiprosate has been shown to exert a relevant neuroprotective effect both in vitro and in vivo by binding to
soluble amyloid beta and inhibiting the formation of neurotoxic
aggregates (Gervais et al., 2007). Consistent with these reports, this
study demonstrates that tramiprosate may represent an effective
neuroprotectant for ischemic stroke injury.
In the ﬁrst part of this study, we conﬁrm that tramiprosate
treatment at doses of 6.26e50 mg/kg substantially reduces the
infarct size in rats following MCAO. Based on the measurement of

the dose-dependence of this effect, we found that tramiprosate
exerts protective effect at a dose as low as 6 mg/kg. Moreover,
tramiprosate treatment at the dose of 50 mg/kg exerts the greatest
protective effect on the rat brain after MCAO. Tramiprosate was
administered at this dosage in the following animal studies. The
beneﬁcial effects of tramiprosate were also detected when the
compound was administered 6 h after MCAO, suggesting that the
therapeutic time window of tramiprosate (50 mg/kg) for experimental stroke is up to 6 h after MCAO, while the time window of
tPA for stroke is from 3 to 4.5 h (Liu and McCullough, 2011). It has
been indicated that “too little/too late” is a recipe for failure in the
treatment of ischemic stroke (Jonas et al., 2001). This prolonged
therapeutic window supports the therapeutic potential of tramiprosate as a neuroprotective agent for the treatment of ischemic
stroke (Gervais et al., 2007).
In addition to the therapeutic window, assessment of functional
recovery is important for evaluating therapies aimed at enhancing
brain tissue plasticity after stroke (Cuello, 1997; Schallert et al.,

2000; Zhang et al., 2002). In this study, we found that neurologic
function was impaired after ischemic insult in the rat, but this
impairment was signiﬁcantly ameliorated by treatment with tramiprosate. Assessment of functional deﬁcits requires a clear understanding of the relationship between histopathological damage
and functional consequences (Pineiro et al., 2000; Zhang et al.,
2002). The Nissl staining experiment revealed that tramiprosate
reduced neuronal loss in the ischemic brain tissue (Ashe and Berry,
2003). Tramiprosate treatment reduced the number of TUNELpositive cells and inhibited the expression of activated caspase-3,
suggesting that tramiprosate reduced apoptosis after stroke (Le
et al., 2002; Luo et al., 2002). These improvements in functional
recovery and attenuation of neuronal death induced by tramiprosate treatment may indicate tramiprosate as an effective therapy
for ischemic stroke.
In addition, another major ﬁnding of the current investigation
included the mechanisms by which tramiprosate exerted its neuroprotective effects. The NMDAR is a glutamate-gated ion channel
consisting of an NR1 subunit and at least one type of NR2 subunit
(Zhao et al., 2005). The NMDAR plays a crucial role in regulating the
activation of multiple genes, neural development and long-term
synaptic plasticity in the CNS (Kemp and McKernan, 2002). However, during pathological conditions, such as those following a
stroke, NMDARs are excessively activated due to an uncontrolled
increase in the concentration of extracellular glutamate, resulting
in increased Ca2þ inﬂux and neuronal death (Martin and Wang,
2010). In our study, the results indicated that tramiprosate might
confer neuroprotection in the brain against stroke via NMDARmediated signalling pathways. First, we conﬁrmed that tramiprosate might effectively reduce NMDA-induced excitotoxicity as well
as ischemia-induced neuron damage in vitro. Moreover, we
discovered for the ﬁrst time that the tramiprosate-induced reduction in the infarct size was blunted by MK801 co-administration in
rats, and the protective effects of tramiprosate were prevented by
MK801 in vitro, indicating the neuroprotective effects of tramiprosate are mediated by activation of the NMDAR. In addition,
tramiprosate suppressed the increase in [Ca2þ]i and neurotoxic NO
production, which play important roles in the NMDAR pathway,
caused by OGD or NMDA. It has been reported Ca2þ inﬂux through
the NMDAR stimulates neurotoxic NO production by activating
nNOS (Rameau et al., 2007), thereby contributing to glutamateinduced neuronal death (Keynes and Garthwaite, 2004). Moreover, NMDA receptor activity may be coupled to nNOS activation
due to close spatial interaction (Arundine et al., 2003). Thus, we
examined whether disruption of the co-localisation of the NMDAR
and nNOS could contribute to the neuroprotective effect of
tramiprosate.
PSD95, also referred to as synapse-associated protein-90
(SAP90), is a scaffolding protein that binds to both NMDARs and
nNOS at excitatory synapses and assembles them into a macromolecular signalling complex. Furthermore, studies have revealed
that PSD95 interacts with the C terminus of the NMDAR and the
PDZ domain of nNOS (Fukaya and Watanabe, 2000). Activation of
nNOS depends on both its association with PSD95 and NMDARmediated Ca2þ inﬂux (Hu et al., 2013). Recent studies have
demonstrated that ischemia-induced injury is caused by NMDARdependent translocation of nNOS from the cytosol to the membrane via the interaction between nNOS and PSD95 (Zhou et al.,
2010). Therefore, dissociating this interaction between nNOS and
PSD95 blocks the translocation of nNOS, which contributes to
NMDAR-dependent cerebral ischemic injury. Disrupting the interaction between nNOS and PSD95 can dissociate the NMDAR from
downstream nNOS signalling without blocking synaptic activity;
this intervention has been conﬁrmed to be neuroprotective with

less side effects and a wider therapeutic window than conventional
NMDAR inhibition (Lai et al., 2011).
In this study, the inﬂuence of tramiprosate on the interactions of
the PSD95enNOS complex was examined using co-IP and western
blotting in vitro and in vivo. The results revealed that tramiprosate
markedly disrupted the interaction between PSD95 and nNOS.
Moreover, the expression of nNOS in the membrane and the cytosol
of neurons was measured. The results revealed that tramiprosate
signiﬁcantly inhibited the translocation of nNOS from the cytosol to
the membrane without affecting the total nNOS expression level.
This ﬁnding indicated that tramiprosate prevents the formation of
the PSD95enNOS complex and the activation of nNOS, thereby
leading to a reduction in NO production. In addition, we found that
tramiprosate did not affect total nNOS expression, the deﬁciency of
which has been proven to impair learning and memory (Kelley
et al., 2009) and cause aggressive behaviour (Nelson et al., 1995),
suggesting that tramiprosate may display less side effects as a potential drug for ischemic stroke.
Moreover, few clinical adverse effects, except for nausea and
vomiting at high doses, were observed in a clinical trial that
administered tramiprosate for cerebral amyloid angiopathy, suggesting that tramiprosate may avoid intolerable side effects in
clinical trials (Greenberg et al., 2006). Thus, the dose-dependent
effect, the prolonged therapeutic window, the functional recovery
and the few side effects support the therapeutic potential of tramiprosate as a neuroprotective agent for the treatment of ischemic
stroke (Gervais et al., 2007).
In conclusion, we demonstrate that tramiprosate treatment can
provide neuroprotection based on its dose-dependent effect, therapeutic time window and improvement in functional recovery
following MCAO in rats. In addition, tramiprosate reduced OGD- or
NMDA-induced injury in both NGF-differentiated PC12 cells and
primary cortical neurons. Moreover, this study reveals that the
neuroprotective effect of tramiprosate can be partially attributed to
its disruption of the interaction between PSD95 and nNOS and
inhibition of the translocation of nNOS from the cytosol to the
membrane, resulting in the inhibition of neurotoxic NO production.
The present results imply the potential therapeutic use of tramiprosate for cerebral stroke.
