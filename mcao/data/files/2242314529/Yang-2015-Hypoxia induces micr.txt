Much evidence demonstrated that autophagy played an important role in neural inﬂammation response after ischemia stroke. However, the speciﬁc effect of microglia autophagy in cerebral ischemia is still unknown. In the
current study, we constructed focal cerebral ischemia model by permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion
(pMCAO) in mice. We detected microglia autophagy and inﬂammation response in vivo, and observed infarct
brain areas, edema formation, and neurological deﬁcits of mice. We found that pMCAO induced microglia
autophagy and inﬂammatory response. The suppression of autophagy using either pharmacologic inhibitor (3MA) not only decreased the microglia autophagy and inﬂammatory response, but also signiﬁcantly decreased infarct size, edema formation and neurological deﬁcits in vivo. Taken together, these results suggested that cerebral
ischemia induced microglia autophagy contributed to ischemic neural inﬂammation and injury. In addition, our
ﬁndings also provided novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke, one of the major causes of death and disability, has a
great impact on public health (Kishore et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2014;
Saada and Antonios, 2014). Previously, cerebral ischemia research was
mainly focused on blood ﬂow, cerebral vasculature or neurons (Marks
et al., 2014; Winship et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2013). Recently, microglia
mediated inﬂammation has become an important research point
(Neher et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2014; Galea and Brough, 2013). However, the exact mechanism involved in microglia inﬂammation after
ischemic stroke is still unclear.
Autophagy is a fundamental eukaryotic pathway that has multiple
effects on immunity (Heymann, 2006; White et al., 2010; Luciani
et al., 2010). Autophagy is induced by pattern recognition receptors
and, through autophagic adaptors, it provides a mechanism for the
elimination of intracellular microorganisms. Autophagy controls inﬂammation through regulatory interactions with innate immune signaling pathways, by removing endogenous inﬂammasome agonists
and through effects on the secretion of immune mediators (Oka et al.,
2012; Green et al., 2011; Korkaya and Wicha, 2011).
Though suitable autophagy may provide neuroprotection, the excessive or inappropriate activation of autophagy could induce cell death.
Therefore, inhibiting autophagy is a potential target of stroke treatment
(Puyal and Clarke, 2009). Autophagic activities are signiﬁcantly increased by focal cerebral ischemia mainly in the border of the lesion

where inﬂammation occurs (Rami et al., 2008). However, microglia
autophagy and its role in inﬂammation after ischemic stroke should
be studied.
In the current study, we constructed the pMCAO mice model, analyzed microglia autophagy and inﬂammatory response, and further
explored the effect on ischemic neural injury.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Reagents and animals
3-Methyladenine (3-MA) was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies
against MAP1LC3B and CD11b were obtained from Sigma. Antibody
against Actin was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. C57BL/6
mice (male, 8–10 weeks, 20–24 g) were obtained from the Animal
Center of the Fujian Military Medical University (Fuzhou, China). Animals were housed in individual cages with free access to sterile acidiﬁed
water and irradiated food in a speciﬁc pathogen-free facility at the
Fujian Military Medical University. Experiments were conducted in
accordance with animal care guidelines approved by the Animal Ethics
Committee of the Fujian Military Medical University. All animal studies
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
the Fujian Military Medical University.
2.2. The model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO)
C57BL/6 mice (male, 8–10 weeks, 20–24 g) were anesthetized with
a nitrous oxide:oxygen:isoﬂurane mixture (69%:30%:1%) during

surgical preparation. The right common carotid artery was isolated and
an 8–10 nylon thread with silicon coated tip was inserted into the right
MCA and gently advanced (9.0–10.0 mm). The suture remained there
until mice were sacriﬁced. During the surgery, body temperature was
monitored and maintained in the range of 37 ± 0.3 °C. After the incision
was closed, the animals recovered and were allowed free access to
water and food at ambient temperature until sampling.

concentrations of inﬂammatory factors, including tumor necrosis
factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6, were measured using an
ELISA reagent kit (Dakewe Biotech Company) following the
manufacturer's instructions.

2.3. Administration of 3-MA or Rapa

A series of cerebral cortex sections were selected to perform immunostaining. Brieﬂy, sections were rinsed in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and then blocked with 5% normal horse or goat
serum for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Thereafter, they were incubated with the following primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight: rabbit antimouse LC3 and goat anti-mouse CD11b. Negative control sections were
incubated with 0.01 M PBS rather than the primary antibody. After
being rinsed in 0.01 M PBS, sections were then incubated at RT for 1 h
with secondary antibodies: FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
and Cy3-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG. Fluorescence signals were
detected with a ﬂuorescence microscope (Olympus BX51) at excitation/emission wavelengths of 550/570 nm (Cy3, red) and 492/520 nm
(FITC, green). The double-labeling of CD11b and LC3 was analyzed
using confocal microscopy to exclude an overlap of cells placed in different layers.

To study the effects of autophagic inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA) or autophagic inducer rapamycin (Rapa), mice received an intracerebral ventricular injection of 3-MA (2 μl of a 30 mg/ml solution prepared in 0.9% NaCl), Rapa (2 μl of a 50 mg/ml solution prepared in
0.9% NaCl) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 2 μl) 10 min after pMCAO and
sacriﬁced 12 h, 48 h or 72 h after pMCAO. Brieﬂy, mice were placed
into a clean induction chamber and anesthetized by isoﬂurane (3–4%
for induction and 1–2% for maintenance, Baxter Healthcare Co.
Deerﬁeld, IL) evaporated in an oxygen–air mixture (20%:80%). Throughout the experimental period, rectal temperature was maintained at
37 ± 0.5 °C by an electronic thermostat-controlled warming blanket
(Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL). Body temperature was maintained until
animals completely recovered from anesthesia and displayed normal
motor activity. After animals were returned to their home cages, they
were monitored closely over the next 4 h and then daily for the rest of
the study. For the IVH model, we randomly selected mice and placed
them in a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting Co.) under isoﬂurane anesthesia.
A 1-cm-long midline incision was made in the scalp, beginning midway
between the eyes and terminating behind the lambda. A cotton swab
was used to clear away the soft tissue covering the skull. A Hamilton syringe was mounted onto the injection pump and the needle positioned
directly over the bregma. The x, y, and z axis coordinates were all set to
zero. The needle was then positioned at the entry point, 0.5 mm posterior and 1.0 mm lateral of the bregma to the right.
2.4. Western blot
The cerebral cortex collected from each group was homogenized
and then lysed in Triton X-100/glycerol buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl,
4 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 25% wt/vol sucrose,
pH 8.0, supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitor).
After centrifugation at 5000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, the protein concentration was measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Lysates were
separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in
Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma), and
were incubated with primary anti-mouse antibodies and horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibodies (Jackson
Immunoresearch Laboratories) or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson
Immunoresearch Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein of interest was visualized using Supersignal® West
Dura Duration substrate reagent (Thermo).
2.5. Flow cytometry analysis
FCM assay was used to characterize the phenotype of microglia.
Brieﬂy, the cerebral cortex collected from each group was homogenized
and suspended with PBS, then was stained with anti-LC3II-FITC and
anti-CD11b-PE at 4 °C for 1 h, washed by PBS, and autophagic microglia
were measured using a FCM Calibur ﬂow cytometer (BD company).
Data were analyzed with CellQuest software.
2.6. ELISA
The cerebral cortex collected from each group was homogenized
and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected for analysis. The

2.7. Immunoﬂuorescent labeling

2.8. Infarct volume measurement
The brains were removed and sectioned into ﬁve slices (2 mm
thickness). Infarct volumes were determined using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma) staining. Images were acquired
by a computer-controlled digital camera (Olympus) and analyzed
by Image-Pro plus 6.0 (IPP) software (Media Cybernetics). The
value was corrected for swelling to eliminate contribution of
postischemic edema to the volume of injury. The corrected infarct
volume (CIV) was calculated as CIV = [LT − (RT − RI)] × d, where
LT is the area of the left hemisphere, RT is the area of the right
hemisphere, RI is the infarct area, and d is the slice thickness (2 mm).
Relative infarct volumes are expressed as a percentage of contra lateral
hemispheric volume.

2.9. Measurement of brain edema
Brains were quickly removed and weighted to obtain the wet weight
(wW) using an electronic analytic balance. After drying the sample in an
oven at 100 °C for 24 h, dry tissue weight (dW) was obtained. The
percentage of water was evaluated according to the following formula:
brain water content (%) = (wW − dW) / wW × 100%.

2.10. Evaluation of neurological scores
The neurological scores were determined by Neurological Severity
Scores, a composite of motor, sensory, reﬂex, and balance tests. Neurological function was graded on a scale of 1 to 18; a score of 1 point is
awarded for the inability to perform the test or for the lack of a tested
reﬂex. The higher the score, the more severe the injury (normal score:
2–3; maximal deﬁcit score: 18).

2.11. Statistical analysis
The results are expressed as the mean ± SD of at least 3 separate
experiments performed in triplicate. The differences between groups
were determined with the Student's t-tests using SPSS 13.0 software.
Differences were declared signiﬁcant at *P b 0.05.

the supernatant was collected for TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 analysis using
ELISA assay. As shown in Fig. 3, we found that pMCAO signiﬁcantly increased the protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. To determine the
contribution of autophagic mechanism to inﬂammatory response, the
effects of i.c.v. injection of autophagic inhibitor 3-MA or autophagic inducer Rapa administrated immediately after the onset of ischemia,
and mice were examined at 12 h, 48 h or 72 h. We found that administration of 3-MA signiﬁcantly reduced inﬂammatory response, while
autophagic inducer Rapa signiﬁcantly promoted inﬂammatory response
(P b 0.05). These analyses showed that autophagy inhibitors could
reduce inﬂammatory response after ischemic attack.
3.3. Autophagy inhibitors reduced infarct volume
In mice subjected to pMCAO for 12 h, 48 h or 72 h, extensive infarction was detected over a series of brain sections. As shown in Fig. 4, we
found that infarct volume of mice subjected to pMCAO increased compared to sham-operated animals (P b 0.05). To determine the contribution of autophagic mechanisms to infarct volume, the effects of i.c.v.
injection of autophagic inhibitor 3-MA or autophagic inducer Rapa administrated immediately after the onset of ischemia, and mice were
examined at 12 h, 48 h or 72 h. We found that administration of 3-MA
signiﬁcantly reduced infarct volume from 12 h to 72 h, while Rapa
signiﬁcantly promoted infarct volume (P b 0.05). These analyses
showed that autophagy inhibitors could reduce infarct volume after
ischemic attack.

triplicate showed consistent results. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. *P b 0.05.

3. Results

In mice subjected to pMCAO for 12 h, 48 h or 72 h, brain water content was also observed. As shown in Fig. 5, we found that water content
of mice subjected to pMCAO increased compared to sham-operated
animals (P b 0.05). To determine the contribution of autophagic mechanisms to brain water content, the effects of i.c.v. injection of autophagic
inhibitor 3-MA or autophagic inducer Rapa administrated immediately
after the onset of ischemia, and mice were examined at 12 h, 48 h or
72 h. We found that administration of 3-MA signiﬁcantly reduced
water content from 12 h to 72 h, while Rapa signiﬁcantly promoted
water content (P b 0.05). These analyses showed that autophagy inhibitors could reduce brain water content after ischemic attack.

3.1. pMCAO promoted microglia autophagy

3.5. Autophagy inhibitors reduced ischemic brain damage

In mice subjected to pMCAO for 12 h, 48 h or 72 h, we analyzed the
cell autophagy in the cerebral cortex. As shown in Fig. 1A, Western blot
demonstrated that autophagic marker LC3-II was increased at 12 h after
pMCAO. However, administration of 3-MA could attenuate the cell autophagic activation. In addition, FCM assay was used to characterize
the phenotype of microglia. As shown in Fig. 1B, FCM demonstrated
that LC3-II and CD11b positive microglia ratio increased at 12 h after
pMCAO. However, administration of 3-MA could decrease LC3-II and
CD11b positive microglia ratio. To further conﬁrm that autophagy
induced by pMCAO occurs in microglia, we used speciﬁc marker
CD11b antibody to mark microglia, and used LC3 antibody to mark
autophagosomes (Roy et al., 2008). As shown in Fig. 2A, CD11b could
co-localize with LC3, suggesting that autophagy induced by pMCAO
occurs in microglia. Moreover, 3-MA treatment also decreases autophagy in in-vivo experiments. The results demonstrate that pMCAO induces
microglia autophagic activation and autophagy inhibitor could attenuate this response.

In mice subjected to pMCAO for 12 h, 48 h or 72 h, neurological injury was also observed. As shown in Fig. 6, we found that neurological injury of mice subjected to pMCAO increased compared to sham-operated
animals (P b 0.05). To determine the contribution of autophagic
mechanisms to ischemic brain damage, the effects of i.c.v. injection of
autophagic inhibitor 3-MA or autophagic inducer Rapa administrated
immediately after the onset of ischemia, and mice were examined at
12 h, 48 h or 72 h. We found that administration of 3-MA signiﬁcantly
reduced neurological injury from 12 h to 72 h, while Rapa signiﬁcantly
promoted neurological injury (P b 0.05). These analyses showed that
autophagy inhibitors could ameliorate the neurological symptoms
after ischemic attack.

In mice subjected to pMCAO for 12 h, 48 h or 72 h, the cerebral cortex collected from each group was homogenized and centrifuged, and

4. Discussion
Stroke is a debilitating disease for which limited therapeutic
approaches are available currently (Behrouz, 2013; Zhang et al.,
2013a; Wong et al., 2013). Thus, there is an urgent need for developing
novel therapies for stroke. Upon ischemia onset, activated resident
microglia and astrocytes, and inﬁltrated immune cells release multiple
inﬂammation factors including cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, free
radicals and other small molecules, not only inducing brain damage

but affecting brain repair (Bell et al., 2013; Benakis et al., 2010;
Bodhankar et al., 2013).
Recent progress indicates that anti-inﬂammation is an important
therapeutic strategy for stroke (Wang et al., 2012, 2013a; Zhang
et al., 2013b). For example, estrogen promotes a neuroprotective
phenotype through a myriad of actions, including stimulating
neurogenesis, promoting neuronal differentiation and survival, suppressing neuroinﬂammation and maintaining the integrity of the
blood–brain barrier (Liu et al., 2005). Fernandez found that cannabinoid agonist WIN protects against neonatal focal stroke in part due to
inhibitory effects on microglia (Price et al., 2009). However, the
speciﬁc mechanisms involved in microglia mediated inﬂammation
have not been fully identiﬁed.

Autophagy is a critical cellular process that involves the sequestration, degradation and digestion of intracellular components by lysosomes (Jiang et al., 2014; Nelson and Shacka, 2013; Urbanek et al.,
2014). This process is vital both for metabolic homeostasis, allowing
healthy cells to efﬁciently remove and recycle cellular constituents,
and for maintenance of cellular integrity, by preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins and of damaged organelles (Zhang et al.,
2014; Luo et al., 2013; Xing et al., 2014). In recent years it has become
clear that autophagy is a vital arbiter of inﬂammation. Since autophagy
affects the effector cells of innate and adaptive immunity mediating the
inﬂammatory response, its activity in these cells inﬂuences the development of cognate immune defense and the course of the inﬂammatory
reactions (Deretic et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013b; Castillo et al.,

2012). For example, evidence demonstrated that miR-195/autophagy
signaling represents a novel pathway regulating neuroinﬂammation
and neuropathic pain, thus offering a new target for therapy of neuropathic pain (Shi et al., 2013). In addition, the roles of autophagy bridge
both the innate and adaptive immune systems and autophagic dysfunction is associated with inﬂammation, infection, and neurodegeneration
(Arroyo et al., 2014; Joven et al., 2014). Therefore, to identify microglia
autophagy and inﬂammation after ischemia stroke, we investigated
the autophagy formation and the speciﬁc role in microglia inﬂammation
and neural function.
Firstly, we observed microglia autophagy after pMCAO in mice. The
results demonstrated that pMCAO induced autophagic activation.
Secondly, we detected that pMCAO signiﬁcantly increased the protein
levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and administration of autophagic inhibitor 3-MA signiﬁcantly reduced inﬂammatory response. However, autophagic inducer Rapa signiﬁcantly promoted inﬂammatory response.
These analyses showed that autophagy inhibitors could reduce inﬂammatory response after ischemic attack. Lastly, we found that extensive
infarction, water content in mice brains and neurological injury subjected to pMCAO signiﬁcantly increased compared to sham-operated
animals. On the contrary, autophagy inhibitor 3-MA signiﬁcantly
reduced infarct volume, water content and neurological injury. All the
evidence suggested that autophagy might be involved in brain inﬂammation and damage, and autophagy inhibitors could ameliorate the
neurological symptoms after ischemic attack.
However, while 3-MA is known to inhibit autophagy by
blocking autophagosome formation via the inhibition of type III

by Neurological Severity Scores, a composite of motor, sensory, reﬂex, and balance tests.
Neurological function was graded on a scale of 1 to 18, and repeated 3 times. Experiments
performed in triplicate showed consistent results. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI-3K), there are other processes
that these kinases may inﬂuence. Thus, effects observed by blockade of these kinases with a single agent, 3-MA, cannot be concluded
to be due only to blockade of autophagy. The occurrence of authentic autophagy will be conﬁrmed with further pharmacologic agents
in future studies. In addition, other studies reported that autophagic inducer rapamycin possesses anti-inﬂammatory effects
(Abdulrahman et al., 2011; Lisi et al., 2014). The reason might be
that autophagy plays different roles in different disease models.
In summary, our ﬁndings provide a novel mechanism that hypoxia
induces microglia autophagy and inﬂammation. The therapeutical
strategy based on autophagy might represent a new insight for ischemic
stroke.
