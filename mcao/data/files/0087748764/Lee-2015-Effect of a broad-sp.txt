Background and Purpose—Expression of numerous chemokine-related genes is increased in the brain after ischemic
stroke. Here, we tested whether post-stroke administration of a chemokine-binding protein (CBP), derived from the
parapoxvirus bovine papular stomatitis virus, might reduce infiltration of leukocytes into the brain and consequently limit
infarct development.
Methods—The binding spectrum of the CBP was evaluated in chemokine ELISAs, and binding affinity was determined
using surface plasmon resonance. Focal stroke was induced in C57Bl/6 mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion for
1 hour followed by reperfusion for 23 or 47 hours. Mice were treated intravenously with either bovine serum albumin
(10 μg) or CBP (10 μg) at the commencement of reperfusion. At 24 or 48 hours, we assessed plasma levels of the
chemokines CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL2/MIP-2, as well as neurological deficit, brain leukocyte infiltration, and infarct
volume.
Results—The CBP interacted with a broad spectrum of CC, CXC, and XC chemokines and bound CCL2/MCP-1 and
CXCL2/MIP-2 with high affinity (pM range). Stroke markedly increased plasma levels of CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL2/
MIP-2, as well as numbers of microglia and infiltrating leukocytes in the brain. Increases in plasma chemokines were
blocked in mice treated with CBP, in which there was reduced neurological deficit, fewer brain-infiltrating leukocytes,
and ≈50% smaller infarcts at 24 hours compared with bovine serum albumin–treated mice. However, CBP treatment was
no longer protective at 48 hours.
Conclusions—Post-stroke administration of CBP can reduce plasma chemokine levels in association with temporary atten­
uation of brain inflammation and infarct volume development.   (Stroke. 2015;46:537-544. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.

troke accounts for >10% of all deaths, as well as prolonged
disability of one third of survivors.1 Approximately 80%
of all adult strokes are ischemic in origin.2 After a disruption
of blood supply to the brain, an infarct develops, comprising
a central core of dead neurons surrounded by a penumbra of
surviving but compromised tissue that is vulnerable to further
inflammation-related injury or death caused by infiltrating
immune cells.3,4
Chemokines are a family of chemotactic cytokines that
attract leukocytes toward a site of injury.5,6 Thus, together with
their receptors expressed on leukocytes, chemokines play a
crucial role in the extravasation and migration of leukocytes
under inflammatory conditions.7 In the highly inflammatory

setting of acute ischemic stroke, chemokines are generated
by brain-resident microglial cells and infiltrating immune
cells, resulting in further leukocyte attraction and activation.8,9
Chemokines and their cognate receptors regulate both physiological and pathological processes in the central nervous
system, and it is currently postulated that chemokines play a
generally deleterious role by contributing to brain injury after
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion.10
We have shown that expression of numerous chemokinerelated genes is upregulated in the mouse brain from 4 hours
for ≥3 days after ischemia–reperfusion,11 raising the possibility that certain key chemokines/chemokine receptors could
represent targets for acute stroke therapy. For example, we

found that expression of neutrophil-associated CXCR2 and its
ligands, CXCL1 and CXCL2, were substantially upregulated
in the brain after cerebral ischemia and that treatment with an
antagonist of CXCR2 could markedly reduce both expression
of CXCR2 and neutrophil infiltration after stroke. However,
those effects of the antagonist were not associated with any
reduction in either functional impairment or infarct volume,
raising the possibility that such an approach may need to target a broader suite of chemokines/chemokine receptors to be
efficacious.11
Many viruses secrete proteins that bind chemokines as a
means of evading the host immune system and ensuring their
own survival.12 Recently, a novel type of chemokine-binding
protein (CBP) has been identified from orf virus,13–15 and fellow parapoxviruses, bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV),
and pseudocowpox virus.16,17 This CBP shows high-affinity
binding for both human and mouse CC, CXC, and C chemokines and has been demonstrated to prevent inflammatory
monocyte recruitment to the skin and to block dendritic cell
trafficking to peripheral lymph nodes.13–15,18 Because of its
capacity to bind 3 classes of chemokine and to impair leukocyte trafficking in vivo, the parapoxvirus CBP represents
a powerful tool with which to target a broad range of chemokines and dissect their role in the pathogenesis of diseases
driven by inflammation. Thus, here we have tested the hypothesis that acute systemic administration of CBP after cerebral
ischemia–reperfusion in mice may reduce plasma chemokine
levels, leukocyte infiltration, and infarct development.

Materials and Methods
Animals
This study was conducted in accordance with the National Health and
Medical Research Council of Australia guidelines for the care and use
of animals in research. A total of 96 male C57Bl/6 mice (6–10 weeks
old) were studied. The mice had free access to water and food pellets before and after surgery. Data were included from 73 mice, and
23 mice were excluded from the study because during the surgical
procedure to induce cerebral ischemia–reperfusion, (1) there was inadequate (<60%) or excessive (>90%) reduction in regional cerebral
blood flow (n=11); (2) no measured increase in blood flow at reperfusion after 1 hour ischemia (n=2); (3) death occurred before the designated period of 23 or 47 hours of reperfusion had elapsed (n=4); (4)
there were technical problems with intravenous injections (n=4); or
(5) data were excluded as statistical outliers based on infarct volume
(n=2; Grubbs’ test; GraphPad Prism version 6; GraphPad Software
Inc., San Diego, CA).

Cloning, Expression, and Purification of CBP
The CBP open reading frame was amplified by PCR using a plasmid containing the 20.7 kb BamHI A fragment from BPSV strain
V660 as a template19 with the following primers: 112BPSV_F
(5′-GGCGGCGCGCCTGAAGTCGACATATCTGTTATTC-3′)
and 112BPSV_R (5′-AAGGCGCGCCTGCTCCTCATCCTTT
GCGGA-3′). The PCR product was digested with AscI and ligated
into a pAPEX-3-derived vector. The recombinant CBP, tagged with
the FLAG octapeptide at the C terminus, was expressed in 293-EBNA
cells, then purified and quantified, as previously described.20

Assay of CBP Activity
Chemokine binding activity can be measured indirectly by the ability
of a protein to interfere with the detection of the chemokine by specific
ELISA.21 CCL2 and CXCL8 OPTI EIA ELISA kits (BD Biosciences,

Franklin Lakes, NJ) and CCL3, CCL5, CCL19, XCL1, CXCL2,
CXCL4, CXCL10, and CXCL12 DuoSet ELISA Development kits
(R&D Systems Inc, Minneapolis, MN) were used in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions unless stated otherwise. MaxiSorp 96well immunoplates (Nalgene Nunc, Penfield, NY) were coated overnight at 4°C with capture antibody, then blocked with 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 hour at room
temperature. In nonabsorbent 96-well plates, chemokines (murine
(m)CCL2, 720 pmol/L; mCCL3, 400 pmol/L; human (h)CCL5, 200
pmol/L; mCCL19, 730 pmol/L; hXCL1, 640 pmol/L; mCXCL2, 700
pmol/L; hCXCL4, 370 pmol/L; hCXCL8, 360 pmol/L; hCXCL10,
370 pmol/L; and hCXCL12, 375 pmol/L) were mixed with increasing amounts of CBP diluted in PBS. The chemokine/CBP mixes were
incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C and then transferred with chemokine
standards to the coated plates for a further 15 minutes incubation at
37°C. The plates were washed with PBS/0.005% Tween-20, then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with biotinylated detection
antibody and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish-peroxidase. After
a final wash, captured chemokine was detected with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (BD Biosciences), and the reaction was stopped with
H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured.

Binding Analysis Using Surface Plasmon Resonance
The surface of a CM5 sensor chip was immobilized with ≈500 response units (pg/mm2) of CBP in 10 mmol/L C2H3NaO2 (pH 4.5) by
standard amine coupling using a Biacore X100 instrument. All experiments were performed at 25°C with HBS-EP buffer (20 mmol/L
Hepes, 150 mmol/L NaCl 3.4 mmol/L EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate
20, pH 7.4). The coupled CBP was exposed to chemokines at a flow
rate of 30 μL/min at concentrations ranging from 0.195 nmol/L to
100 nmol/L for a duration of 180 seconds. Chemokines were allowed
to dissociate in 600 seconds before the surface was regenerated using 10 mmol/L glycine-HCl (pH 2.0). The data were analyzed using
BIAevaluation software version 2.0.1 (Biacore, Stockholm, Sweden)
using the 1:1 protocol for binding with mass transfer.14,15

Cerebral Ischemia–Reperfusion
Focal cerebral ischemia–reperfusion was induced as described previously.22,23 Briefly, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine
(80 mg/kg IP) and xylazine (10 mg/kg IP). Rectal temperature was
monitored and maintained at 37.0±0.5°C throughout the procedure
with a heat lamp until animals regained consciousness. After a midline neck incision, the right external carotid and pterygopalatine arteries were isolated and cauterized. The internal carotid artery was lifted
and occluded at the peripheral site of its bifurcation as soon as the
distal common carotid artery was clamped. Focal cerebral ischemia
was induced by intraluminal filament occlusion of the right middle
cerebral artery (MCA) for 1 hour using a 6-0 nylon monofilament
with a silicone-coated tip (0.20–0.22 mm; Doccol Co., Redlands,
CA). Reduction in regional cerebral blood flow was confirmed using
transcranial laser-Doppler flowmetry (PF5010 LDPM Unit; Perimed;
Järfälla, Sweden) in the area of cerebral cortex supplied by the MCA
(≈2 mm posterior and ≈5 mm lateral to bregma). Mice were treated
intravenously with 0.1 mL of either BSA (control, 10 μg; n=32) or
CBP (1 μg, n=9; 10 μg, n=22) at the commencement of reperfusion.
Based on the incomplete reduction in post-stroke plasma chemokine
levels after administration of 1 μg CBP (see below), our study focused on the effects of 10 μg CBP only. Sham-operated mice (n=18)
were anesthetized, and the common carotid artery was dissected free
from surrounding connective tissue, but the MCA was not occluded.
When animals regained consciousness, they were injected subcutaneously with 1 mL saline to prevent postoperative dehydration, before
returning them to their cage for recovery.

Neurological Assessment and Quantification of
Infarct Volume
Neurological deficit was evaluated in all mice at 24 hours, and in some
mice at 48 hours, in a blinded fashion using a 5-point scoring system

(0, no deficit; 1, failure to extend either paw; 2, circling to one side; 3,
leaning to one side; and 4, not walking spontaneously), as described
previously.22–24 Cerebral infarct and edema volume were also estimated as described.22 Mice were euthanized by inhalation of isoflurane,
followed by decapitation. The brain was removed immediately and
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Coronal sections (30 μm thickness;
separated by ≈420 μm) were obtained and stained with 0.1% thionin
to delineate the infarct using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as mean± SEM. Statistical
significance (P<0.05) was determined by 1-way analysis of variance
with Dunnett’s post hoc test (for plasma ELISA data), Bonferroni’s
multiple comparison tests (for flow cytometry data), unpaired t test
(infarct and edema volume data), or Mann–Whitney test (neurological deficit score data), as appropriate, using GraphPad Prism version
6 (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA).

Results
CBP Binds a Broad Spectrum of CC, CXC, and C
Chemokines With High Affinity
Certain characteristics of the parapoxvirus CBPs have previously been described. The CBP from orf virus, the type species of the parapoxvirus genus, binds a range of CC, CXC, and
C chemokines with high affinity and can neutralize the activity of CC chemokines in vitro and in vivo.13–15,18 Publication
of the complete genome sequence of another parapoxvirus,
BPSV strain AR-02 revealed an equivalent CBP ≈24 kb from
the right terminus of the genome.16 We therefore sequenced
the corresponding region in the BamHI A fragment of the
genome from BPSV strain V660 and identified an equivalent
CBP. The sequence of the BPSV V660 CBP has been deposited in GenBank under accession no. KM400588. The CBP
from BPSV V660 is predicted to be 298 aa in length with a
19 aa signal peptide. The predicted proteins from the 2 BPSV
strains share 95% identity, whereas both share only 42% identity with the orf virus CBP.
The CBP from BPSV V660 was expressed with a
C-terminal FLAG octapeptide and then purified. Chemokinebinding activity of the purified protein was then assessed
using an ELISA. The CBP was found to bind all CC and C
chemokines tested, including CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1α,
CCL5/RANTES, CCL19/MIP-3β, and XCL1/lymphotactin
(Figure 1A and 1B). The CBP also interacted with CXCL2/
MIP-2 and CXCL4/PF4 but did not bind CXCL8/IL-8,
CXCL10/IP10, or CXCL12/SDF-1 (Figure 1C). To confirm
its broad spectrum binding across different classes of chemokines, we investigated the binding affinity of the CBP for
murine CCL2/MCP-1, XCL1/lymphotactin, and CXCL2/
MIP-2 using surface plasmon resonance (Table II in the

Quantitative analysis of immune cell subsets was conducted as
previously described.25 In brief, 35 mice (12 sham-operated, 12
BSA-treated post-stroke; 11 CBP-treated post-stroke) were deeply
anesthetized with isoflurane, blood was collected into a syringe containing 10% (wt/vol) 400 IU clexane (enoxaparin sodium; Sanofi,
Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia) via cardiac puncture, and the animals were then perfused with PBS and euthanized by decapitation.
Brains and spleens were also collected for cell analysis. Right brain
hemispheres were enzymatically digested with collagenase type XI
(125 U/mL), hyaluronidase (60 U/mL), and collagenase type I-S (450
U/mL) in Ca2+/Mg2+-supplemented PBS (Sigma, St Louis, MO) at
37°C for 30 minutes and then passed through a 70 μm filter (BD
Falcon, Bedford, MA) to obtain single cell suspensions. Cells were
washed and resuspended in 30% percoll (GE Healthcare, Uppsala,
Sweden), underlaid with 70% percoll, and centrifuged for 20 minutes
at 2400 rpm in the absence of a brake. The cells at the interphase of
the density gradients were collected for antibody staining. For blood
samples, leukocytes were purified with red blood cell lysis buffer
(155 mmol/L NH4Cl, 10 mmol/L KHCO3, and 3 mmol/L EDTA).
Spleens were mechanically dissociated and passed through 70 μm
filters to obtain a single-cell suspension before incubating with red
blood cell lysis buffer. All cells were then resuspended in buffer (1%
BSA in PBS) containing a mixture of antibodies as listed in Table I in
the online-only Data Supplement. After antibody staining, cell populations were analyzed using an LSRII Flow Cytometer run with DIVA
software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). For blood and spleen analyses, 5×105 or 2×105 events were captured, respectively. Data were
analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree star Inc, Ashland, OR).

lower affinity (0.725 and 1.358 nmol/L, respectively). Each
chemokine bound the CBP with fast association kinetics, but
the rate of dissociation was much slower for CCL2/MCP-1.

Cerebral Blood Flow and Neurological Deficit
To test the effect of CBP on various outcome measures after
stroke, mice were intravenously injected with 10 μg CBP or
BSA (as a control protein) at the commencement of reperfusion after 1 hour MCA occlusion. Cerebral ischemia was
confirmed in all animals by ≈80% reduction in regional cerebral blood flow during 1 hour MCA occlusion (Figure 2A).
Blood flow transiently returned to ≈100% of the preischemic
level after injection of BSA or CBP at the commencement of
reperfusion, although mice treated with CBP tended to have a
slightly higher mean level of flow for the remaining 20 minutes recording period (Figure 2A). At 24 hours, CBP-treated
mice had a lower median neurological deficit score than those
treated with BSA (Figure 2B). Moreover, 7 of 26 (27%) BSAtreated mice but only 1 of 19 (5%) CBP-treated mice received
the most severe score (score of 4). Further, 2 of 26 (8%) BSAtreated mice compared with 7 of 19 (37%) CBP-treated mice
received a score of 0, indicating no deficit. However, by 48
hours, median neurological deficit score had worsened in
CBP-treated mice such that deficit was now equivalent to
those that had been treated with BSA (Figure 2B).

Flow Cytometric Analysis of Leukocytes in Brain,
Blood, and Spleen
There was a 3-fold increase in the total number of leukocytes
present in the brains of control mice at 24 hours after cerebral ischemia compared with sham-operated mice (P<0.05,
n=6–7; Figure 4A). However, in mice treated with CBP after
stroke, leukocyte numbers in the brain at 24 hours were
reduced almost to sham levels (Figure 4A). This profile
of effect was also seen for individual cell types, including
neutrophils, T cells, and monocytes, whereas the increased
number of macrophages in the brain after stroke tended to
be unaffected by CBP treatment (Figure 4B). Furthermore,
in control mice, stroke increased the number of microglia in
the brain by ≈3-fold at 24 hours, but this effect was virtually
abolished by CBP treatment (Figure 4C). From 24 to 48 hours
after stroke in control mice, the numbers of infiltrating neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes further increased by
≈2-fold, whereas numbers of T cells and microglia declined
(Figure 4B and 4C). Moreover, by 48 hours in CBP-treated

Plasma Chemokines
Compared with sham-operated mice, plasma levels of both
CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL2/MIP-2 were increased by >25-fold
at 24 hours in control mice subjected to cerebral ischemia–
reperfusion (Figure 3A and 3B). Between 24 and 48 hours,
plasma chemokine levels in control mice declined by ≈50%,
but nonetheless remained elevated compared with the sham
control group (Figure 3). By contrast, in CBP-treated mice,
plasma levels of both CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL2/MIP-2 were
similar to levels in sham-operated mice at both the 24 and 48
hours time points (Figure 3). In preliminary experiments, we
also tested the effect of a 10-fold lower dose of CBP (1 μg,
n=9) on plasma chemokine levels at 24 hours after stroke and
found it to cause reductions of only ≈20% versus BSA control
treatment (CBP 1 μg versus BSA for CCL2/MCP-1: 950±278
pg/mL versus 1113±466 pg/mL; CXCL2/MIP-2: 921±332 pg/
mL versus 1205±566 pg/mL), and so in subsequent experiments, only the 10 μg dose of CBP was studied.

mice, the numbers of total leukocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes all tended to be even higher than
those measured in the brains of control mice, whereas numbers of T cells and microglia were no longer elevated above
sham levels (Figure 4A–4C).
Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion resulted in 2- to 3-fold
greater numbers of total leukocytes, neutrophils, T cells,
and monocytes in blood at 24 hours (Figure 5A–5D), but no
change in cell numbers in the spleen at 24 hours (Figure IA–IF
in the online-only Data Supplement). In contrast to its effects
in the post-stroke brain, CBP had no effect on immune cell

numbers in either the blood (Figure 5A–5D) or spleen (Figure

Total and cortical infarct volumes and also edema volume
were all smaller in CBP-treated versus control mice at 24
hours (Figure 6A–6C; Figure IIA and IIB in the online-only

be ≈40% smaller at 24 hours in mice treated with CBP compared with control mice (Figure 6D; Figure IIC in the onlineonly Data Supplement). Infarct and edema volumes were

similar in control mice at 24 and 48 hours post-stroke; however, at 48 hours, the volume of infarcted tissue and swelling
had increased in CBP-treated mice such that there was no longer any difference from control mice (Figure 6A–6D; Figure

This is the first study to investigate the use of a broad spectrum
viral CBP to assess the effects of chemokine-induced cell
migration on stroke outcome in mice. After the identification
and generation of a recombinant CBP from the parapoxvirus,
BPSV, we confirmed its interaction with a broad spectrum of
CC, C, and CXC chemokines and its ability to bind CCL2/
MCP-1, XCL1/lymphotactin, and CXCL2/MIP-2 with high
affinity. The chemokine-binding spectrum and affinities of the
BPSV CBP were consistent with those reported for the CBP
from its fellow parapoxvirus, orf virus.13–15,18 After establishing the ability of the CBP to inhibit a broad spectrum of chemokines, we investigated its efficacy in vivo. We found that
intravenous administration of the CBP after transient cerebral
ischemia largely prevented stroke-induced increases in circulating levels of key chemokines in association with milder
neurological deficit at 24 hours. Flow cytometric analysis
revealed that treatment with CBP also attenuated leukocyte
infiltration in the brain after stroke. In addition, early development of brain infarct and swelling were markedly reduced in
mice treated with CBP compared with control mice injected
with BSA. Our data therefore support the concept that chemokines are key contributors to brain inflammation and injury
in the initial stages after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. Thus,
post-stroke systemic administration of a therapy to broadly
target and bind chemokines can provide temporary neuroprotection by delaying leukocyte infiltration into the injured
brain.
We first examined the effect of post-stroke intravenous
administration of CBP on the circulating levels of chemokines
that are representative of CC and CXC families, namely CCL2/
MCP-1 and CXCL2/MIP-2, respectively. These chemokines

are produced by several cell types, including endothelial cells,
monocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, and their expression
is known to be markedly upregulated in the mouse model
of transient cerebral ischemia used here.7,11,26 Our data confirm that plasma levels of CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL2/MIP-2
remain increased by >25-fold at 24 hours and by >10-fold at
48 hours after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion in control mice
and indicate that CBP treatment prevented these increases.
These findings suggest that injection of this novel broad spectrum CBP after stroke can effectively target and remove multiple proinflammatory chemokines from the circulation.
We next examined the effect of CBP treatment on the numbers of circulating leukocytes and of those infiltrating the brain
after stroke. We confirmed that stroke increases the number
of leukocytes present in both the blood and ischemic brain
hemisphere of control mice at 24 hours after cerebral ischemia. Despite having no effect on the number of leukocytes in
the blood at this time, CBP treatment markedly reduced leukocyte numbers in the brain after stroke. This effect was due
mainly to a reduction in infiltrating neutrophils, T cells, and
monocytes. We also found that stroke increased the number
of microglia in the brain by ≈3-fold at 24 hours and that CBP
treatment prevented this increase over 48 hours. An important role of microglia in the ischemic brain is to phagocytose
debris in damaged tissue, neutrophils, and apoptotic cells that
have the potential to release damaging molecules.27 Indeed,
CCL2/MCP-1 overexpression in the brain is reported to result
in increased microglial activation, whereas CCL2/MCP-1deficient mice exhibit impaired microglial accumulation and
reduced leukocyte infiltration in numerous neuroinflammatory diseases.28,29
In association with delayed leukocyte infiltration in the postischemic brain, we found that infarct development was retarded
in CBP-treated mice. Such a profound effect from a single poststroke administration of CBP is noteworthy and is conceptually consistent with data from mice with genetically modified
levels of chemokine expression. For example, infarct volume is
larger in CCL2/MCP-1-overexpressing mice,30 whereas global

CCL2/MCP-1 deficiency results in delayed infarct development associated with less severe blood–brain barrier disruption.31 With reference to this latter study, our data thus indicate
that systemic administration of a CBP immediately after
cerebral ischemia–reperfusion can achieve therapeutic neuroprotection that is comparable to that seen in animals that are
globally deficient in chemokines. It is also interesting to note
that CBP treatment effectively prevented T cell infiltration into
the ischemic brain for 48 hours, during which time neurological deficits and infarct volume developed to similar levels as in
control mice. This observation would tend to argue against a
major overall role of T cells in causing post-stroke brain injury,
although it is plausible that the lack of T regulatory cells in the
brain was detrimental.32 In addition to directly interacting with
chemokines, CBP could decrease chemokine synthesis, but we
think this to be unlikely. We have found that CBP administration has no immediate effects on inflammatory chemokine or
cytokine expression in skin, but levels do eventually decrease
because of the reduced influx of inflammatory cells expressing
the same proteins. Moreover, we have observed no inhibition
of chemokine expression by CBPs when administered to cultured monocytes (data not shown).
An emerging paradigm is that there are temporal changes in
the hierarchy of chemotactic molecules in injured or infected
tissue, such that end target chemoattractants (eg, complement
component C5a or bacterial products) ultimately override the
signals delivered by chemokines (ie, “intermediate” chemoattractants) released at intermediary sites, such as the endothelium.33 It is noteworthy that neutrophils—which preferentially
respond to end target chemoattractants33—comprised >50%
of the leukocytes infiltrating the ischemic brain at 48 hours.
We therefore predict that sustained protection from leukocyte-mediated brain injury after stroke will require effective
targeting of chemokines together with other important chemoattractants. Indeed, delaying infarct development and neurological deficits by targeting early chemokine-dependent
mechanisms of injury after stroke could be beneficial, perhaps
by extending the window of opportunity for other treatments
to be administered.
