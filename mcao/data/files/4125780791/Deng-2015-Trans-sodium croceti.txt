Trans-sodium crocetinate (TSC) is a novel synthetic carotenoid compound that improves diffusion of small molecules, including oxygen, in solutions. TSC provides
neuroprotection in healthy rats and rabbits. This study
seeks to determine whether TSC is neuroprotective in
obese mice. Sixteen-week-old CD-1 male mice that had
been fed a high-fat diet for 10 weeks were subjected to a
90-min middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO). They
received TSC by two boluses through a tail vein 10 min
after the onset of MCAO and reperfusion, respectively,
with doses of 0.14, 0.28, and 0.7 mg/kg or by a bolus–
infusion–bolus strategy with a dose of 0.14 mg/kg during
MCAO. The neurological outcome was evaluated 72 hr
after MCAO. Brain tissues were harvested 24 hr after
MCAO to measure nitrotyrosine-containing proteins, 4hydroxy-2-nonenal, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2
and -9 activity and expression, and inflammatory cytokines. TSC given in the two-bolus strategy did not
improve the neurological outcome. The bolus–infusion–
bolus strategy significantly reduced brain edema, infarct
volume, and hemorrhagic transformation and improved
neurological functions. TSC reduced nitrotyrosinecontaining proteins, MMP-9 activity and expression, and
inflammatory cytokines in ischemic brain tissues. Our
results indicate that TSC delivered by the bolus–infusion–
bolus strategy provides neuroprotection in obese mice.
This protection may occur through reduction of oxidative
stress, MMP-9 activity, or inflammatory cytokines in the
ischemic brain tissues. VC 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Stroke is a common disease. It is one of the leading
causes of death and long-term neurological morbidity
(Martin et al., 1999). However, at this time, effective
neuroprotective strategies for clinical use have not been
established and are urgently required to improve neurological outcomes after stroke.
Ischemic brain injury is the underlying pathophysiology for stroke. One potential way to reduce ischemic brain
injury is to attenuate the degree of ischemia. Trans-sodium
crocetinate (TSC) has been shown to facilitate the diffusivity

of oxygen and other small molecules in aqueous solutions
(Stennett et al., 2006). It can reduce the degree of ischemia
by facilitating the diffusion of oxygen or nutrients into ischemic brain tissues. This “metabolic reflow” during ischemia
has been shown to reduce focal brain ischemia-induced
injury in young adult animals (Manabe et al., 2010) and has
been proposed for use in patients with hemorrhagic shock
(Stennett et al., 2007). However, it is not known whether
this neuroprotective effect occurs in animals with diseases or
pathological conditions that are often associated with stroke.
Obesity is a major health problem in the United
States and the world. Obesity and its associated metabolic
disturbances, including hyperlipidemia, have been identified as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and many
other diseases (Bhatnagar et al., 2008). Hyperlipidemia has
been consistently identified as a risk factor for stroke in
patients, including young patients (Iso et al., 1989; Balci
et al., 2011). Statins, which are cholesterol lowering
agents, reduce patients’ risk for stroke (Sacco and Liao,
2005). Hyperlipidemia has also been shown to increase
stroke severity (Mikdashi et al., 2007), although opposite
findings have been reported (Olsen et al., 2007; JimenezConde et al., 2010). Obesity can induce neuroinflammation (Purkayastha and Cai, 2013; Buckman et al., 2014)
and worsen neuroinflammation and neurological outcomes after brain ischemia (Tu et al., 2011; Dhungana
et al., 2013). Neuroinflammation is a significant

pathological process that leads to cell injury (Lipton,
1999; Li et al., 2013). Because hyperlipidemia can alter
the rheology of blood and extracellular fluids (Katayama
et al., 2010), it can affect the effectiveness of TSCenhanced diffusivity of small molecules. Thus, it is essential to determine whether TSC still provides neuroprotection in animals with obesity and hyperlipidemia. To
determine possible mechanisms for this TSC effect, various parameters, including those that reflect neuroinflammation, were measured.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All experimental protocols used in this study were
approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the University of Virginia. All surgical and experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the
care and use of laboratory animals (NIH publication number 8023) revised in 2011. This article is written in accordance with
Animal Research: Reporting in vivo Experiments. Six-weekold CD-1 male mice from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) were fed a high-fat diet (45% of calories supplied
by fat; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) for 10 weeks
before they were used in experiments.
Animal Groups and TSC Delivery
In the first experiment, animals were randomly divided
into four groups that received normal saline (n 5 10), 0.14 mg/
kg TSC (n 5 8), 0.28 mg/kg TSC (n 5 7), or 0.7 mg/kg TSC
(n 5 7). The TSC was diluted in saline to a volume of 2 ll/g
body weight and given as two boluses 10 min after the onset of
ischemia and reperfusion, respectively, via a tail vein.
In the second experiment, mice were randomized to
receive saline (n 5 15) or 0.14 mg/kg TSC (n 5 16) by a
bolus–infusion–bolus strategy via a tail vein as described elsewhere (Manabe et al., 2010). TSC was diluted in saline to a
volume of 2 ll/g body weight. Ten minutes after the onset of
ischemia, a bolus of one-eighth dosage of the required saline or
TSC was administered, followed by continuous infusion for 60
min to give a six-eighths dosage of saline or TSC. At the end of
infusion, the final one-eighth dosage was injected as a bolus.
These TSC dosages were selected from previous studies
(Okonkwo et al., 2003; Lapchak, 2010; Manabe et al., 2010).
Transient Focal Cerebral Ischemia
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice by using an intraluminal filament technique as described elsewhere (Li and Zuo, 2011). Briefly,
mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane carried by pure
oxygen. A small midincision was made in the neck to expose the
right common carotid artery and the external carotid artery. The
external carotid artery was gently cut open, and a suture with a
rounded 0.22-mm-width tip (No.1622; Beijing Sunbio Biotechnology, Beijing, China) was put through the cut into the right
internal carotid artery until a slight resistance was felt. Mice were
awakened immediately after the MCAO was achieved in the first
set of experiments but were kept under isoflurane anesthesia for

the second experiment to facilitate TSC infusion. The filament
was removed 90 min after the onset of MCAO.
Neurological Outcome Evaluation
Three days after the MCAO, neurological deficit scores
were evaluated by a blinded observer (Li and Zuo, 2011). Mice
were then anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and perfused with
normal saline through the left cardiac ventricle until clear fluid
ran from the incision of the right atrium. The brain was cut
into 1-mm-thick coronal slices. Each slice was observed carefully and blindly for hemorrhagic transformation (HT), which
is defined as gross blood staining in the ischemic brain tissues.
An animal was considered to have HT if any of the animal’s
brain slices had evidence of HT. The slices were then stained
with 1% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution to evaluate edema severity and infarct volume. Edema index 5 right
hemisphere volume/left hemisphere volume; corrected infarct
volume in percentage 5 (left hemisphere volume – [right hemisphere volume – right infarction volume]) 3 100/left hemisphere volume. The infarct area in each brain slice was
quantified in Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Motor coordination was evaluated just before and 3 days
after the MCAO as previously described (Li and Zuo, 2011).
Mice were placed on a rotarod the speed of which accelerated
from 4 to 40 rpm in 5 min. The latency and speed at which a
tested mouse fell off the rod were recorded. The speed–latency
index, which is latency 3 speed (rpm), was calculated. The
ratio of this index obtained at 3 day after the MCAO over that
before MCAO was calculated to reflect the change of coordinate function of the mouse after the MCAO.
Brain Tissue Harvesting
Mice were treated with saline (n 5 7) or TSC (n 5 5) in
the same way as described above for the second experiment.
They were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane and perfused with
refrigerated normal saline through the left cardiac ventricle.
The brains were rapidly removed and dissected into left and
right hemispheres. The cerebral cortex, frontal cortex area 1
(Fr1), and striatum were dissected, immediately frozen, and
maintained at 280 C until use. Fr1 ipsilateral to the ischemia
side is considered an ischemic penumbral region after MCAO
(Zheng and Zuo, 2004; Li and Zuo, 2011).
Matrix Metalloproteinase Activity Assessment
Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity was assessed by
gelatin zymography. Brain tissues were homogenized in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitor
cocktail and 0.005% butylated hydroxytoluene and then incubated on ice for 30 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at
13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 C. Thirty-microliter supernatants
were mixed with 23 sample buffer for gelatin zymographic
analysis as described elsewhere (Wang et al., 2000). Briefly, 30
lg of proteins per lane was loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide
gels containing 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis, the gelatinolytic activity in the gel was revealed by incubation in a sequence
in a renaturing buffer, a developing buffer, 0.5% Coomassie
blue G-250 in 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid, and a

bands at the appropriate molecular weights in the gel.
Western Blotting
Approximately 30 lg proteins per lane were loaded on
10% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were
transferred onto PVDF membrane that had been incubated
with primary antibodies overnight at 4 C. The primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibody (1:500;
Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, CA), goat polyclonal antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a antibody, rabbit polyclonal antiinterleukin (IL)-1b antibody, and mouse monoclonal antiintercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 antibody (1:100;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After the membrane was washed with PBS-Tween, appropriate secondary
antibodies were used (1:5,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Protein bands were revealed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence method, photographed, and analyzed with a gel imaging system (G-Box; Syngene, Frederic, MD).
Measurement of Nitrotyrosine-Containing
Proteins and 4-Hydroxy-2-Nonenal
The contents of nitrotyrosine-containing proteins and 4hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) in the brain tissues were assessed
with OxiSelect nitrotyrosine ELISA and OxiSelect HNE-His
Adduct ELISA kits (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA), respectively,
according to the manufacture’s protocols and as previously
described (Li and Zuo, 2011). The results were normalized by
protein content.
Immunofluorescence Staining
One day after the MCAO, animals without TSC treatment were sacrificed under 5% isoflurane and perfused with
ice-cold normal saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS. Brain tissues were further fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 24 hr, dehydrated, and paraffin embedded. Fivemicrometer-thick coronal sections at bregma 20.58 mm were
acquired for immunofluorescent staining. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline containing
1% bovine serum albumin at 4 C overnight and then incubated
in fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hr at room

mouse monoclonal antivascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse
monoclonal antiglial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibody
(1:500; Millipore, Billerica, MA), rabbit polyclonal anticluster
of differentiation (CD)-11b (1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, MA),
and mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN antibody (1:500; Millipore).
Images were examined and taken in the ischemic Fr1 area with
an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope.
Statistical Analysis
Data from all animals that completed this study are
reported. Parametric results are presented as mean 6 SEM (n  4)
and were analyzed by Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test after confirmation of normal distribution
of the data. Neurological deficit scores or nonnormally distributed results were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on ranks,
followed by Dunn’s test. P  0.05 was considered significant.

RESULTS
Sixteen-week-old male CD-1 mice that had been fed a
high-fat diet for 10 weeks were significantly heavier than
the age-matched male CD-1 mice that had been fed a
regular diet (50.4 6 1.8 g vs. 39.8 6 0.9 g,; n 5 9;
P < 0.05), suggesting that the mice that had been fed the
high-fat diet were obese. As previously reported, these
mice also had hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia (Deng
et al., 2014). The following results were obtained with
the 16-week-old male CD-1 mice that had been fed a
high-fat diet for 10 weeks. As shown in Table I, there
were no differences in physiological parameters among
the groups at the time when the MCAO was achieved.
TSC Administered by Two Boluses Did Not
Provide Neuroprotection
It is obviously helpful to establish metabolic reflow
during brain ischemia. Also, blood flow interruption may
induce microclot formation in the circulation distal to the
arterial occlusion site. Some brain tissues might still be
ischemic because of these microclots after the occluded

artery is reopened. Thus, we designed the two-bolus regimen for TSC. Ten, eight, seven, and seven mice were
used for saline, 0.14, 0.28, and 0.7 mg/kg TSC groups,
respectively. The mortality rate in these groups is listed in
Table I. These deaths occurred in a time window from 2
to 72 hr after the onset of reperfusion. The difference in
mortality among the four groups did not reach statistical
significance. Also, the HT rates were not different among
the groups (Table I). The three TSC doses that were
tested did not reduce brain edema or infarct volume and
did not improve neurological functions (Fig. 1). These
results suggest that TSC at the chosen doses given by two
boluses did not provide neuroprotection.
TSC Given During Brain Ischemia Provided
Neuroprotection
In this study, TSC was also given by under a bolus–
infusion–bolus regimen. Fifteen and sixteen mice were
used in the saline and 0.14 mg/kg TSC groups, respectively. The mortality rate from 2 to 72 hr after the
MCAO in the saline and TSC groups was 60% and 25%,
respectively (P 5 0.073). Mice treated with TSC also had
less severe brain edema, smaller brain infarct volume, and
better neurological functions (Fig. 2). TSC also significantly reduced the HT rate (Table I). These results suggest that TSC administered by bolus–infusion–bolus
provides neuroprotection.

the nonischemic striatum and cortex. The increase of
nitrotyrosine-containing proteins in the ischemic cerebral
cortex but not in the ischemic striatum was attenuated by
TSC. The HNE level in the nonischemic cerebral cortex
was higher than that in the ischemic cortex. TSC did not
affect the HNE levels in the ischemic and nonischemic
brain tissues (Fig. 3).
TSC significantly reduced the levels of ICAM-1,
TNF-a, and IL-1b in the ischemic brain tissues, suggesting that TSC reduces inflammatory cytokines in these tissues. TSC also reduced MMP-9 activity but did not affect
MMP-2 activity in the ischemic striatum and penumbral
cortex. TSC decreased MMP-9 expression in the ischemic cerebral cortex (Fig. 4). The expression of MMP-9 in
the ischemic Fr1 areas was colocalized with NeuN,
VEGF, and CD11b, markers for neurons, endothelial
cells, and microglia, respectively, but was not colocalized
with GFAP, a marker for astrocytes, suggesting that
MMP-9 is expressed in the neurons, microglia, and cerebral vessels (Fig. 5).
DISCUSSION
A high-fat diet was used to induce obesity in mice. This
model should closely simulate human obesity because an
excessive high-fat diet is a major cause for obesity and
hyperlipidemia in humans (Kopelman, 2000). Our results
clearly show that 0.14 mg/kg TSC given under a bolus–
infusion–bolus regimen improved neurological outcomes
after transient focal brain ischemia. TSC has been shown
to improve neurological outcomes after ischemic brain
injury in young adult rats and rabbits (Lapchak, 2010;
Manabe et al., 2010). This study provides initial evidence

that TSC provides neuroprotection in animals with pathological conditions, such as obesity and hyperlipidemia,
which often exist in patients suffering from ischemic
stroke (Iso et al., 1989; Balci et al., 2011).
TSC can enhance hydrogen bonding among water
molecules. This effect reduces chaos in aqueous solutions,
which facilitates the diffusivity of small molecules, such as
oxygen, in those solutions, including plasma and interstitial fluids (Gainer, 2008). This process creates a
“metabolic reflow” phenomenon in which oxygen and
other small nutrients are diffused to the ischemic tissues
from neighboring tissues with blood flow. Consistent
with this idea, ischemic penumbral brain tissue oxygenation during transient focal brain ischemia was much
improved by TSC in rats in a previous study (Manabe
et al., 2010). This metabolic reflow mechanism is considered to be the major mechanism for TSC-induced neuroprotection (Manabe et al., 2010). However, the
biochemical changes underlying the neuroprotection have
not been studied.
The current study shows that TSC inhibited TNFa, IL-1b, and ICAM-1 expression in the ischemic brain
tissues. TNF-a and IL-1b are important proinflammatory
cytokines. ICAM-1, whose expression can be increased

by TNF-a and IL-1b (Stanimirovic and Satoh, 2000), is
an adhesion molecule that facilitates the migration of leukocytes into tissues. Inflammation after brain ischemia
and reperfusion can cause cell death and injury (Lipton,
1999). Leukocyte infiltration to tissues is part of inflammation and contributes to tissue damage. Therefore,
reducing inflammatory responses in the ischemic brain tissues might be a mechanism for TSC-induced neuroprotection. Consistent with this possibility, enhancing
neuroinflammation after brain ischemia might contribute
to the worsened neurological outcome in rodents with
obesity (Tu et al., 2011; Dhungana et al., 2013)
Oxidative stress-induced cell injury is an important
pathophysiological process after brain ischemia and reperfusion (Lipton, 1999). TSC is an antioxidant, but it may
require a high TSC concentration for this effect (Stennett
et al., 2007). The current study shows that nitrotyrosinecontaining proteins, an indicator of oxidative stress in
protein, are increased in the ischemic brain tissues. This
increase in the cerebral cortex ipsilateral to the ischemic
side but not in the ischemic striatum is attenuated by
TSC. The cerebral cortical tissues are a mixture of cortical
tissues in the ischemic core, penumbral regions, and normal tissues. The striatum is in the ischemic core after

MCAO. These results suggest that it might be difficult for
TSC to reduce the oxidative stress in the ischemic core
tissues. On the other hand, HNE, an indicator for oxidative stress in lipid, was not increased in the ischemic brain
tissues. TSC did not affect the HNE levels in the ischemic
or nonischemic HNE tissues. These results suggest that
HNE might not be a good indicator for oxidative stress in
the ischemic tissues at 24 hr after brain ischemia and
reperfusion.
This study shows that TSC significantly reduces
HT. HT is a complication after ischemic stroke and can
worsen outcomes for patients. This study also shows
that TSC reduces the MMP-9 expression and activity
but not MMP-2 activity in the ischemic brain tissues.
To maximize the possibility of detecting the changes in
MMP activity, we used ischemic core and penumbral
tissues for the study because HT usually occurs only in
these tissues. MMP is involved in the breakdown of
extracellular matrix. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are collagenases and gelatinase and exist in the blood vessels (Olszynski and Zimowska, 2009). These MMPs have been
implicated in HT after brain ischemia (Montaner et al.,
2001, 2003; Sumii and Lo, 2002). Increased MMP-9
activity is considered an important factor for HT after
thrombolytic therapy. In fact, increased MMP-9 expression may be a biomarker for HT in patients after
thrombolytic therapy (Montaner et al., 2003). Consistent
with a possible role of MMP-9 in HT, the current study

shows that MMP-9 is expressed in the cerebral vessels
of obese mice after brain ischemia.
The current study shows that TSC reduces inflammation, oxidative stress, and MMP-9 expression and
activity in the ischemic brain tissues, which may be the
underlying biochemical changes for the TSC-induced
neuroprotection, including reduced HT. However, it is
not known whether these biochemical changes are the
direct effects of TSC or indirect effects from the metabolic reflow caused by TSC. It requires millimolar levels
of TSC in solution to have significant antioxidative effects
(Stennett et al., 2007). It would be almost impossible to
reach this concentration in the ischemic brain tissues with
the dose that was used (0.14 mg/kg). Thus, it is possible
that TSC, via its metabolic reflow effect, reduces the
severity of brain ischemia, which leads to the favorable
biochemical changes. These favorable changes then further reduce brain injury after brain ischemia and
reperfusion.
It has been shown that TSC does not increase blood
flow to ischemic tissues, oxygen solubility in the blood,
or oxidative phosphorylation processes (Holloway and
Gainer, 1988; Gainer et al., 1993). Thus, TSC might not
affect the cellular metabolism or carrying capacity of oxygen by blood to the ischemic brain tissues to provide
neuroprotection.
The two-bolus regimen with three different doses
did not provide neuroprotection. Given by bolus–

Trans-Sodium Crocetinate, Neuroprotection, and Obesity

infusion–bolus, 0.14 mg/kg TSC was neuroprotective,
but the same dose and two other higher doses given by
two boluses was not neuroprotective. The reasons for this
failure to induce neuroprotection under the two-bolus
regimen are not clear. A single bolus of 0.25 mg/kg TSC
within 1 hr after the brain embolization is neuroprotective in rabbits (Lapchak, 2010). Also, 0.023–0.229 mg/kg
TSC given as a bolus–infusion–bolus, started at 10 min
after the onset of brain ischemia, significantly reduced
brain infarct size in rats (Manabe et al., 2010). These
results suggest that it is necessary to perform a dose–
response study carefully to identify the dosing strategy for
TSC to be neuroprotective in conditions such as obesity
and hyperlipidemia, which are often associated with
stroke.
Because an obvious mechanism for TSC to provide
neuroprotection is by facilitating oxygen diffusion to the
ischemic brain tissues, TSC must be administered soon
after the onset of brain ischemia. This requirement may
limit its use to patients whose brain ischemia is a planned
event during surgery or procedures, such as intracranial
vascular surgery, if its neuroprotective effect is confirmed
in humans. Patients whose ischemic stroke occurs in the
hospital may also benefit from this therapy.
In summary, our results suggest that 0.14 mg/kg
TSC given under the bolus–infusion–bolus regimen provides neuroprotection in obese mice. This effect may
involve reduced oxidative stress, inflammation, and
MMP-9 expression and activity in the ischemic brain
tissues.
