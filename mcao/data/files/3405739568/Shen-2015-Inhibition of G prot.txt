SUMMARY
Aim: Lactates accumulate in ischemic brains. G protein-coupled receptor 81 (GPR81) is an
endogenous receptor for lactate. We aimed to explore whether lactate is involved in ischemic injury via activating GPR81. Methods: N2A cells were transfected with GFP-GPR81
plasmids 24 h previously, and then treated with GPR81 antagonist 3-hydroxy-butyrate
(3-OBA) alone or cotreated with agonists lactate or 3, 5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3, 5-DHBA)
during 3 h of oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD). Adult male C57BL/6J mice and primary
cultured cortical neurons were treated with 3-OBA at the onset of middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) or OGD, respectively. Results: The GPR81 overexpression increased the
cell vulnerability to ischemic injury. And GPR81 antagonism by 3-OBA significantly prevented cell death and brain injury after OGD and MCAO, respectively. Furthermore, inhibition of GPR81 reversed ischemia-induced apoptosis and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) signaling may be involved in the neuroprotection. Conclusions: G proteincoupled receptor 81 (GPR81) inhibition attenuated ischemic neuronal death. Lactate may
aggravate ischemic brain injury by activating GPR81. GPR81 antagonism might be a novel
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability.
Many efforts have been made to find effective neuroprotective
agents, however, few has been successfully translated into clinical
application from basic research. Due to the complexity of the
pathological events after ischemia, the mechanisms underlying
ischemic stroke remain not fully elucidated.
Lactic acid accumulated by anaerobic glycolysis is the principal
component responsible for brain acidification during ischemia [1].
Interestingly, recent studies suggested that lactate, as a ligand, can
regulate glycolytic and oxidative pathways by activating the
lactate responsive G protein-coupled receptor GPR81 [2,3]. The
lactate selective receptor GPR81 is also known as hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor 1 that is highly expressed in adipose tissue [4].
The in situ hybridization showed widespread distribution of GPR81
mRNA in brains, predominantly in neurons within the cortex,
hippocampus, and cerebellum [5]. Some evidence implies that
GPR81 activation associates with neuronal activity and cerebral

energy metabolism [6]. Moreover, activation of GPR81 down-regulates the cAMP and inhibits protein kinase A [7], thereby inhibiting lipolysis and promoting energy-rich metabolites storage [8].
Therefore, GPR81 may play an important role in mediating lactate
signaling in both intact and ischemic brains.
Intracerebral pH decreasing from 7.0 to 6.6 due to lactate accumulation during focal cerebral ischemia [9] evokes inward currents characteristic of acid-sensing ion channels or triggers
glutamate release [10] and thereby contributes to ischemic injury
[11–14]. Lactic acidosis leads to great infarct, either by impairing
neurons or by exacerbating hypoxic loss of astrocytes [15], and
the underlying mechanisms may be attributable to severe oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis [16]. Lactate also induces
tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1 beta
release [17], which further exacerbate neuronal injury [18]. In
contrast, some studies suggested that lactic acidosis may protect
against ischemic injury directly [19]. There is evidence indicating
that administration of lactate reduces ischemic injury by supplying
energy [20,21]. Overexpression of monocarboxylate transporters,

which enhances the uptake of lactate for neurons, reduces infarct
brain volumes [22]. Our previous studies also showed that acidic
preconditioning and postconditioning protect against the neuronal death in a variety of ischemia models [23,24]. Therefore, the
contributions of lactic acid to ischemic brains are controversial
and it is unknown whether GPR81 activation by accumulated
lactate during ischemia is involved in ischemic injury.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Male adult C57BL/6 mice weighing 22–25 g were used. For primary cortical neuronal culture, pregnant Sprague–Dawley rats
with embryonic (E18) fetuses were used. All experiments were
approved by and carried out in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Zhejiang University Animal Experimentation Committee and were in complete compliance with the National Institutes
of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Every effort was made to minimize any pain or discomfort, and
the minimum number of animals was used.

Focal Cerebral Ischemia and Drugs
Administration
Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of choral
hydrate (350 mg/kg). Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) as described previously
[25]. Briefly, a 6–0 nylon monofilament suture, blunted at the tip
and coated with 1% poly-L-lysine, was inserted 10 mm into the
internal carotid to occlude the origin of the MCA. Achievement of
ischemia was confirmed by monitoring regional cerebral blood
flow by laser Doppler flowmetry (Model Moor VMS-LDF2; Moor
Instruments Ltd., Devon, UK). Animals with <80% reduction in
CBF in the core of the MCA area were excluded from the study.
Body temperature was maintained at 37°C by a heat lamp (FHC,
Bowdoinham, ME, USA) during surgery. Mice were given an
intracerebroventricular injection of 2 lL 3-hydroxy-butyrate
(3-OBA; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at the onset of MCAO.
3-OBA was dissolved in normal saline before injection. Control
mice were injected with the same volume of saline.
Infarct volume was determined at 24 h after surgery by 2, 3, 5
-triphenyltetrazolium hydrochloride (TTC; 0.25%) staining, and
the extents of the normal and infarct areas were analyzed with
ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,
USA) and determined by a indirect method, which corrects for
edema. The percentage of the corrected infarct volume was calculated by dividing the infarct volume by the total contralateral
hemispheric volume, and this ratio was then multiplied by 100.

Cell Culture, OGD Procedures, and Cell Viability
Determination
For primary cortical neuronal culture, E18 rats were used. Briefly,
the dissected cortex was treated with 0.125% trypsin in Hank’s
buffer (in mmol/L: 137 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.4 KH2PO4, 0.34 Na2HPO4
• 7H2O, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES) for 10 min at 37°C and dissociated by repeated passage through a series of fire-polished Pasteur

pipettes. Approximately 2 9 105 cells/cm2 were seeded onto
poly-L-lysine (10 lg/mL)-coated plates and dishes. The neurons
were cultured in serum-free neurobasal medium (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen),
10 U/mL penicillin, 10 U/mL streptomycin, and 0.5 mmol/L glutamine at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cultures were maintained for 7 days before further treatment and
were routinely observed under a phase-contrast inverted microscope. To certify the neuron percentage in our cultures, we
stained the neurons by immunostaining against NeuN and we
found that the neuron percentage is approximated 85–90%.
Mouse neuroblastoma neuro-2a (N2A) cells were routinely
cultured in DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 10 U/mL penicillin, and 10 mg/
mL streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5%
CO2.
For OGD treatment, cells were rinsed once with warm glucosefree DMEM (Gibco), and then refreshed with glucose-free DMEM
prebalanced in an O2-free chamber at 37°C. Cells were then immediately placed into a sealed chamber (MIC-101; Billups-Rothenburg, Del Mar, CA, USA) loaded with mixed gas containing 5%
CO2 and 95% N2 for 5 min at 20 L/min. Primary cultured neurons
were kept in chambers for 4 h and N2A cells for 3 h. The indicated
concentrations of 3-OBA, lactate (Sigma), and 3, 5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,5-DHBA; Sigma) were dissolved in glucose-free
DMEM medium and added to the cells during OGD. Control cells
were given equal refreshment but were incubated in glucose-containing DMEM at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, respectively.
Cell viability was determined by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay after OGD.

Plasmids and Transfection
The mice GPR81 cDNA was amplified from a mouse fat cDNA
library by PCR with the forward primer: 50 -GGA AGA TCT TCC
ATG CCA GTC CTC TCT CCA AC-30 and the reverse primer:
50 - CCG GAA TTC CGT CAA CAC ACT TGG AGA TCC C-30 . The
PCR product was inserted into the BglII and EcoRI site of pEGFPC1 plasmid to construct the pEGFP-GPR81 plasmid. N2A cells
were transfected using jetPRIME reagent (Polyplus transfection)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and cells were
subjected to further experiments 24 h after transfection.

Apoptosis Assay
Neuronal apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling assay
(TUNEL) using a cell death detection kit (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Images of nine random fields were captured from each
sample. The results were expressed as percentage of TUNEL-positive cells to total DAPI-stained cells. Cell death was detected using
combined staining with the chromatin dye, Hoechst 33342, and
propidium iodide (PI). Hoechst 33342 (10 lg/mL) was added to
the culture medium for 10 min at 37°C before cells were incubated with PI (10 lg/mL) for a further 10 min at 4°C. After three
washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room tempera-

was further centrifuged 3500 9 g for 10 min at 4°C, and the pellet
was collected as the mitochondria-enriched fraction. The remaining supernatant was then centrifuged 12,000 9 g for 20 min at
4°C, and the supernatant was considered as cytosolic protein fraction. Protein samples were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk, the membranes were
incubated with primary antibodies against Cytochrome C (1:800;
CST, Beverly, MA, USA), Cleaved-caspase3 (1:1000; CST), Bax
(1:1000; CST), Bcl-xl (1:1000; CST), GPR81 (1:500; Santa Cruz,
CA, USA), p-ERK (1:1000; CST), ERK (1:1000; CST) or GAPDH
(1:3000; KangChen, Shanghai, China) at 4°C overnight. After
repeated washes, the membranes were reacted with antibodies
against rabbit IgG (IRDye 800-coupled, 1:10,000) or mouse IgG
(IRDye 700-coupled, 1:5000) for 2 h at room temperature. Images
were acquired with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR
Biosciences, 9120, Lincoln, NE, USA) and analyzed using the
Odyssey software [26]. The relative optical density was obtained
by comparing the measured values with the mean values from the
control group.

Determination of ATP Levels
The level of ATP in primary cultured neurons and transfected
N2A cells were determined using the ATP assay kit (Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology, JiangSu, China), according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, harvested cultured cells after
OGD were lysed with a lysis buffer, followed by centrifugation at
12,000 9 g for 10 min at 4°C. The level of ATP was determined
by mixing 50 lL of the supernatant with 50 lL of luciferase
reagent, which catalyzed the light production from ATP and luciferin. The emitted light was linearly related to the ATP concentration and measured using a microplate luminometer (Varioskan
Flash, 5250040; Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA).

Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy
After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, cells were
permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked with
5% normal donkey serum for 2 h. Slices were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies: anti-Cytochrome C (1:200;
CST), or anti-Tom20 (1:200; Anbo Biotechnology, San Francisco,
CA, USA). Samples were washed with PBS for three times and
incubated in secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature.
Coverslips were observed under a confocal microscope (Fluoview
FV1000; Olympus). Mander’s overlap efficiency was measured
and analyzed as previous described by Image Pro-Plus software
[27].

Statistical Analysis
All data were collected and analyzed in a blind fashion. Data are
presented as mean  SD. One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance)
with Dunnett’s T3 post hoc test was applied for multiple comparisons. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
GPR81 is Involved in Oxygen–Glucose
Deprivation-Induced Neuronal Cell Death
To determine the role of GPR81 in ischemia, GFP-GPR81 was
transfected into mouse neuroblastoma neuro-2a (N2A) cells 24 h
before. The transfection efficiency was confirmed by Western blot
detecting of GFP and GPR81, respectively (Figure 1A). Our data
showed that GFP-GPR81 transfection aggravated OGD-induced
cell death from 45.06  0.27 to 36.43  1.22% (Figure 1B,
P < 0.05). The transfected cells were then exposed to 3hydroxy-butyrate (3-OBA), the antagonist of GPR81 [28]. We
found that in the transfected N2A cells, 3-OBA treatment significantly prevented the cell viability reduction in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 1B, P < 0.01). Furthermore, lactate,
the agonist of GPR81, reversed the protection of 3-OBA in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure S1). Similarly, 3, 5-dihydroxybenzoic acid [29] (3, 5-DHBA), another agonist of GPR81,
reversed the protection from 57.19  2.95% to 45.09  2.28%
(Figure 1C, P < 0.01). Using combined Hoechst 33342 and PI
staining, we found that 3-h OGD increased both apoptotic and
necrotic N2A cells, while 3-OBA treatment reduced PI and Hoechst positive-staining from 55.57  1.78% to 30.11  2.77%
(Figure 1D, P < 0.01). In GFP positive-staining cells, the cell
death decreased from 66.11  3.46% to 17.11  2.79% after
the treatment of 3-OBA (Figure 1D, P < 0.001), and this reduction was more prominent. In addition, lactate significantly
reversed the protection of 3-OBA (Figure 1D, P < 0.001). These
data suggested that GPR81 is involved in ischemic neuronal
injury.

Inhibition of GPR81 Protected Against Ischemic
Neuronal Injury Both In Vitro and In Vivo
Constitutive GPR81 expression in C57BL/6 mice brain was
detected (Figure S2A). The expression of GPR81 in the cortex after
indicated duration of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
was assessed by Western blot. The results revealed that GPR81
was transiently upregulated and peaked at 1 h after ischemia

(Figure S2B). To further determine the involvement of GPR81 in
ischemic injury, primary cultured neurons were exposed to the
indicate concentration of 3-OBA at the onset of OGD. It was
shown that 3-OBA increased cell viability in a concentrationdependent manner (Figure 2A, P < 0.01). To confirm the neuroprotection from GPR81 antagonism against ischemic brain injury,
mice were given an intracerebroventricular injection of indicate
dosage of 3-OBA. It was shown that 3-OBA decreased infarct
volumes in a dose-dependent manner (Figure. 2B,C, P < 0.01).
These data showed that inhibition of GPR81 protected against
brain ischemic injury in vivo and in vitro.

Inhibition of GPR81 Reduced OGD-Induced
Apoptosis
Apoptosis is well-accepted responsible for the cell demise after
ischemia. And we found that 3-OBA reduced PI and Hoechst positive-staining. Therefore we postulated that GPR81 antagonism
may release ischemia-induced apoptosis. To this end, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay (TUNEL) staining was carried out to test the apoptotic
cell ratio with 3-OBA treatment. The results showed that 4-h
OGD in primary cultured neurons significantly increased the
apoptosis ratio, whereas treatment with 3-OBA reversed the cell
apoptosis (Figure 3A, P < 0.05). The antiapoptosis protein Bcl-xl
and pro-apoptosis protein Bax have been proved closely associated with apoptosis [30]. Our results showed that following 3-h
OGD Bax/Bcl-xl ratio was significantly increased in GFP-GPR81
transfected N2A cells, whereas it was decreased with 3-OBA treatment (Figure 3B, P < 0.01). In addition, the Bax/Bcl-xl ratio
reduction by 3-OBA was partly reversed by cotreatment with
GPR81 agonist lactate (P < 0.01). After ischemia, Cytochrome C
(Cyt C) releases from mitochondria into cytosol and thus activates
caspase family proteins leading apoptotic cell death. Caspase-3,
another marker of apoptosis, gave results similar to Bax/Bcl-xl
ratio (Figure 3B, P < 0.01). Cyt C releasing into cytosol induced
by 3-h OGD was significantly down-regulated by 3-OBA treatment (Figure 3B, P < 0.01). Similarly, cotreatment with lactate
increased the cytosolic Cyt C level (P < 0.05). To verify their
effects on Cyt C release, mitochondria and Cyt C were visualized

with fluorescent, and the overlaps between mitochondria and Cyt
C were quantified. In control cells, the mitochondria marker
Tom20 was almost colocalized with Cyt C. However, less overlap,
suggesting Cyt C release, was observed in OGD cells, which could
be reversed by 3-OBA incubation. Similarly, this overlap can be
partly counteracted with lactate treatment (Figure 3C). Overall,
these data suggested inhibition of GPR81 reduced ischemiainduced apoptosis.

GPR81 Aggravates Ischemic Brain Injury

The Impact of GPR81 Agonist and Antagonist on
ATP Level
3-OBA and lactate are considered as the energy substrates for neurons [31,32]. To test whether 3-OBA and lactate provided energy
during ischemia, we examined the intracellular ATP level both in
GFP-GPR81 transfected N2A cells and primary cultured neurons
with OGD treatment. The results showed that OGD significantly
decreased the ATP level in two cell types (Figure 4A,B). Neither
3 mmol/L 3-OBA treatment nor 1 mmol/L lactate (the dose used
in this study) could reverse the ATP decline, but higher level of
lactate (20 mmol/L) significantly increased the concentration of
ATP in primary cultured neurons (Figure 4B, P < 0.05), as well as
transfected N2A cells (Figure 4A, P < 0.01). These data suggested
that energy supplying may not responsible for the neuroprotection of 3-OBA.

Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase Signaling
Pathway is Involved in the Protection of GPR81
Antagonism
The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway played an antiapoptotic role in ischemia-induced apoptosis
[33]. To determine the involvement of ERK pathway in the
protection of GPR81 antagonism, we detected the phosphorylated ERK by Western blot. The results showed that OGD treatment decreased the levels of phosphorylated ERK, which was
reversed by 3-OBA incubation in both primary cultured neurons (Figure 5A, P < 0.05) and GFP-GPR81 transfected N2A
cells (Figure S3A, P < 0.01). ERK dephosphorylation was confirmed by a specific MEK inhibitor U0126 in Western blot
analysis. Furthermore, we found that U0216 reversed the protective effects of 3-OBA from 72.18  3.78% to 39.68 
13.47% in neurons (Figure 5B, P < 0.01). Similarly, U0216
counteracted the protection in transfected N2A cells (Figure
S3B, P < 0.01). To reveal whether GPR81-mediated apoptosis is
related to ERK dephosphorylation, caspase-3 level was determined in the absence and presence of U0126. Our data showed
that U0126 counteracted the 3-OBA-conferred caspase-3 reduction in primary cultured neurons (Figure 5A, P < 0.05), as well
as in GFP-GPR81 transfected N2A cells (Figure S3A, P < 0.01).
These data suggested that ERK signaling pathway was involved
in the protection of GPR81 antagonism.

Discussion
Lactate accumulation is an important event after cerebral ischemia [1,34,35]. However, the contributions of lactate to ischemic
brains are still controversial [36]. Previous investigations on lac-

GPR81 Aggravates Ischemic Brain Injury

Z. Shen et al.

tate principally focus on its role of as a pH regulator or an energy
supplier. Interestingly, recent studies suggested that lactate acts as
a signaling molecule to regulate neuronal activity via its endogenous receptor GPR81 [5,6,37]. However, little is known about
GPR81 in lactate-involved ischemic brain injury. Here, we found
that lactate receptor GPR81 was involved in cerebral ischemic
injury. The GPR81 antagonism by 3-OBA showed significant
neuroprotection either in oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) or
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, and GPR81
prevented against ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis partly by
regulating ERK signaling.
We found that GPR81-transfected N2A cells, which are with
higher transfection ratio versus primary cultured neurons, were
more vulnerable to OGD insult compared with nontransfected
ones (45.06  0.27% vs. 36.43  1.22% of control by MTT assay,
respectively). Moreover, the GPR81 antagonism by 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OBA) [28] conferred a dose-dependent protection in
transfected N2A cells, which can be counteracted by the GPR81
agonists lactate [4] and 3, 5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3, 5-DHBA)
[29] (Figure 1). Also, we found that GPR81 mainly expressed in
cortex and striatum which supposed to be the main damage
regions in ischemic brain [9]. In addition, the level of GPR81 in
cortex increased and peaked at 1 h and persisted until 12 h after
ischemia. Since lactate accumulates during ischemia, our data
suggested that lactate may aggravate ischemic injury by activating
GPR81. To address the role of lactate as an energy supplier, we
determined the intracellular ATP levels after treatment and found
that only 20 mmol/L lactate partly rescued the ATP falling either
in N2A cells or primary neurons (Figure 4). Indeed, lactate lower
than 10 mmol/L is incompetent to compensate for energy crisis
during brain ischemia [38,39], whereas it reversed the antagonism
effect of 3-OBA. These data suggested that lactate may have dual
effects on ischemic brain injury: Relative low concentration lactate (approximately 1–3 mmol/L) may contribute to neuronal
injury through GPR81 receptor while high concentration offers its
neuroprotection by supplying ATP. Although it was reported that
high concentration 3-OBA can provide ATP [40], our results
showed that 3 mmol/L 3-OBA offered its neuroprotection without
increasing intracellular ATP. Thus, the 3-OBA may reduce ischemia-induced apoptosis via GPR81 rather than reversing ATP
decline.
To further determine the neuroprotection of GPR81 antagonism
on neurons and brains, the ischemic stroke models in vitro and in
vivo were carried out. 3-OBA reduced OGD-induced primary
cultured neuronal death in a concentration-dependent manner

(Figure 2). Intracerebroventricular injection of 3-OBA at the
onset of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) significantly
alleviated ischemic brain injury. These data for the first time
showed that GPR81 antagonism protect against ischemic brain
injury.
Apoptosis is considered as a main death pattern of neuronal
death in ischemic brains [41]; however, few investigations
indicated that activating GPR81 can regulate apoptosis. We
found that 3-OBA reduced both PI/Hoechst-positive and TUNEL-positive staining, indicating that 3-OBA ameliorated OGDinduced cell apoptosis. This assumption was further supported
by the observation that 3-OBA treating reversed OGD-induced
Bax/Bcl-xl ratio increasing and caspase-3 activation. Additionally, both Western blot and immunofluorescence showed that
3-OBA blocked Cyt C releasing into cytosol. These data provided further evidence that activating GPR81 may aggravate
ischemic cell death. Furthermore, OGD exposure decreased the
levels of phosphorylated ERK, which was rescued by 3-OBA
treatment, suggesting that ERK might be involved in protection
of GPR81 antagonism. U0126, a selective MEK inhibitor,
counteracted the protection of 3-OBA, in terms of cell viability,
caspase-3 ratio reduction. These data suggested that ERK may
be an underlying signal responsible for the protection of
GPR81 antagonism.
In conclusion, the current data indicate that lactate may
aggravated ischemic brain injury by activating GPR81 and inhibition of GPR81 protects against ischemia-induced cell death
via an antiapoptosis pathway. Therefore, GPR81 could serve
as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cerebral
ischemia.
