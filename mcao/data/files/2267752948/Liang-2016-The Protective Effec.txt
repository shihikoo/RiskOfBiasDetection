Abstract
Human umbilical cord blood derived CD34+ stem cells are reported to mediate therapeutic
effects in stroke animal models. Estrogen was known to protect against ischemic injury. The
present study wished to investigate whether the protective effect of CD34+ cells against
ischemic injury can be reinforced with complemental estradiol treatment in female ovariectomized rat and its possible mechanism. Experiment 1 was to determine the best optimal
timing of CD34+ cell treatment for the neuroprotective effect after 60-min middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO). Experiment 2 was to evaluate the adjuvant effect of 17β-estradiol
on CD34+ cell neuroprotection after MCAO. Experiment 1 showed intravenous infusion with
CD34+ cells before MCAO (pre-treatment) caused less infarction size than those infused
after MCAO (post-treatment) on 7T magnetic resonance T2-weighted images. Experiment
2 revealed infarction size was most significantly reduced after CD34+ + estradiol pre-treatment. When compared with no treatment group, CD34+ + estradiol pre-treatment showed
significantly less ADC reduction at 2 h and 2 d, less CBF reduction at 2 h and less hyperperfusion at 2 d. The immunoreactivity of c-Fos, c-Jun and GFAP was attenuated, and BDNF
showed significant recovery from 2 h to 2 d after MCAO, especially after CD34+ + estradiol
pre-treatment. The present study suggests pre-treatment with CD34+ cells with complemental estradiol can be most protective against ischemic injury, which may act through stabilization of cerebral hemodynamics and normalization of the expressions of immediate early
genes and BDNF.

Cord Blood and Estradiol against Cerebral Ischemia

Introduction
Stroke is ranked as one of the leading causes of death, and the poststroke neurological disability
is the most important problem to cause handicap worldwide. Until now, there is limited preventive treatment which could be effective against neuronal damage. Human umbilical cord
blood (HUCB) derived CD34+ stem cells can exhibit neuronal or glial cell properties under
defined culture conditions [1] and have been reported to mediate therapeutic effects in animal
model of stroke [2,3]. Early treatment with HUCB cells may facilitate functional recovery after
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats [4], and the infarction volume measured by
histological sections revealed an inverse relationship with HUCB cell dose [5].
Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a marker for astrocyte, and reactive astrocytosis can
occur after ischemic injury [6]. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to be protective against neuronal damage in in vivo and in vitro studies [7,8]. Combined intravenous treatment
with HUCB cells and mannitol was found to significantly increase cerebral BDNF, which correlated positively with reduced cerebral infarction and improved behavioral functions in a MCAO
rat model [9]. Immediate early genes, c-Fos and c-Jun, can be up-regulated by various forms of
brain injury, and is involved in programmed cell death. In women after menopause, the production of ovarian hormones, progesterone and estrogen, decreases and the risk for cerebral ischemia
increases. Estrogen has been known to confer natural protection to premenopausal women from
ischemic stroke. Estrogen administered before or after ischemia has demonstrated protective effect
against ischemic damage not only in normal rats [10,11] but also in ovariectomized rats [12,13],
and is found to selectively attenuate the injury-induced increase of c-Fos after MCAO [14].
In recent decades, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has obtained considerable interest in
the evaluation of cerebral hemodynamic changes after ischemic injury [15,16]. There is no
study using MR diffusion and perfusion to study the potential mechanism of HUCB derived
CD34+ cells and/or estrogen treatment on cerebral hemodynamics and correlate with the
expression of immediate early genes, BDNF and GFAP after ischemic injury. Previous reports
usually used normal rat to study the protective effect of HUCB derived CD34+ cell against
ischemic injury. The present study wished to test the hypothesis whether in ovariectomized
rats, complemental estradiol can enhance the neuroprotection of CD34+ cell, and whether this
neuroprotection may involve the stabilization of cerebral hemodynamics and normalization of
the expression of immediate early genes and BDNF.

Materials and Methods
Animal Model
All protocols were approved by Institutional Ethics Committee for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals and Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Experimental animals from the National Laboratory Animal Center were maintained at 21–23°C
room temperature and 47% humidity with 12-h light-dark cycle and had free access to standard laboratory chow and tap water.
Experiment 1: determine the best optimal timing of CD34+ cell treatment for the neuroprotection against focal cerebral ischemia
Forty eight ovariectomized female Sprague Dawley rats (270–320 g) were randomly
assigned to 4 groups (n = 12 in each group): (1) sham operation, (2) MCAO with no CD34+
cell treatment (no treatment group), (3) infusion with 1×106 CD34+ cells 30 min before
MCAO (pre-treatment group) and (4) infusion with 1×106 CD34+ cells 30 min after MCAO
(post-treatment group). To induce ovariectomized status, all rats underwent bilateral salpingooophorectomy through a lower abdominal midline incision using a sterile technique 2 weeks

before MCAO. The timing of CD34+ cell treatment which induced the least infarction volume
in experiment 1 was selected for the experiment 2.
Experiment 2: evaluate the protective effect of CD34+ cells + estradiol treatment against
focal cerebral ischemia
Sixty ovariectomized female Sprague Dawley rats (270–320 g) were randomly assigned to
5 groups (n = 12 in each groups): (1) sham operation, (2) MCAO with no treatment (no treatment group), (3) MCAO with infusion of 17β-estradiol (E2, 500 μg/kg) (E2 pre-treatment
group), (4) MCAO with infusion of 1×106 CD34+ cells (CD34+ pre-treatment group), and (5)
MCAO with infusion of E2 (500 μg/kg) and 1×106 CD34+ cells (E2+CD34+ pre-treatment
group). Cerebral T2-weighted MR images (T2WI) were studied to characterize the extent of
infarction volume at 2 h and 2 d after MCAO (n = 6 at each time point) in each group. After
MR imaging study, rats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in a mixture of air with nitrous
oxide and oxygen (70%/30%) before being euthanized. Rats were quickly decapitated and their
brains were removed for the immunohistochemistry study of c-Fos, c-Jun, GFAP and BDNF.

Induction of focal cerebral ischemia
Transient left MCA occlusion for 60 min was used as an acute ischemic model according to
our previous method [17]. Before surgical procedure, rats were quickly anesthetized after inhalation of 3% isoflurane in a mixture of air with nitrous oxide and oxygen (70%/30%), and then
1.5% isoflurane was maintained during the experiment. The proximal portion of external
carotid artery (ECA) was tightly ligated with a silk suture. A 20-mm 4–0 nylon surgical thread
was inserted from left ECA into internal carotid artery (ICA) to occlude the MCA. Left common carotid artery (CCA) was then permanently ligated and the wound was temporarily
closed. Anesthesia was discontinued after these procedures were completed. After a 60-min
occlusion of left MCA, rat was anesthetized again, and the wound was opened to remove nylon
surgical thread to recanalize MCA. In sham-operation group, similar procedures were conducted without ligation or occlusion of any vessel. Endovascular suture occlusion of MCA for
60 min could result in irreversible cerebral ischemic injury in both cerebral cortex and striatum
[17]. Therefore, we only included animals that exhibited right-side weakness with upper-limb
dominance and had infarction in both striatum and cortex at 2 d for study. In both experiments
1 and 2, a total of 127 rats were used. Among them, 3 rats were found to have intracranial hemorrhage after decapitation which was assumed due to penetration of MCA by nylon thread, 5
had no right-side weakness and cerebral infarction, 2 died within 2 days after operation, 2 died
during operation, and 15 had only striatal infarction detected by T2-weighted image on the second day after MCAO (n = 6 in experiment 1 and n = 9 in experiment 2). Although a total of 27
rats were excluded, the final number for each group was kept at 6 for statistical analysis.

Preparation of HUCB derived CD34+ cells
After the approval by Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, HUCB
was obtained from healthy adults with written informed consent using a VarioMACS Starting
Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisteh Gladbach, Germany) and CD34 MicroBead Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisteh Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The CD34+ cells
were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then prepared to a final
concentration of 1×106 cells/0.3 mL in PBS [18]. Thirty minutes before and after MCAO,
1×106 collected CD34+ cells were administered via femoral vein under inhalation anesthesia.
The CD34+ purification was technically supported by Research and Development Department,
HealthBanks Biotech Co., Ltd, and the quantity of CD34+ cells was calculated according to previous report [19].

Magnetic resonance imaging
As described in detail previously [20], inhalation of a nitrous oxide/oxygen/isoflurane mixture
(70%/30%/1.5%) was used to anesthetize the rats before MRI. After exposing the inguinal area,
a biomedical silicone catheter (external diameter of 0.64 mm) was cannulated into left femoral
vein to administer MR contrast agent. During MR scanning, rats were placed in prone position
with head fixed in a reproducible position in a nonmagnetic cradle by using an appropriate
spacer.
The MR images were obtained using a 7T Clinscan animal MRI system with a bore size of
30 cm (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). A volume resonator with a diameter of 72 mm was used
for radio frequency transmission, and a 4-channel phased array coil optimized for rat brains
was used to receive signals. A T2-weighted turbo spin echo sequence was applied to cover most
of the brain regions of interest with 20 coronal slices that used the following imaging parameters: TR/TE = 2920 ms/38 ms, ETL = 7, slice thickness = 1 mm, matrix size = 256 × 256,
in-plane resolution = 0.148 × 0.148 mm2. From these images, five slice locations (2-mm thickness) were selected based on a bregma of 0.4 mm and an interaural distance of 8.6 mm for
T2-weighted imaging with set imaging parameters used for diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI)
and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI. DTI used a spin-echo echo-planar imaging
(EPI) sequence (TR/TE = 3000 ms/34 ms, matrix size = 128 × 128, in-plane resolution = 0.3 × 0.3
mm2, averages = 3) with diffusion gradients applied in 30 directions (b = 600 and 1200 mm/
s2). Parallel imaging was applied using generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisitions with an acceleration factor of 2. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were calculated using the DTI images. Perfusion weighted imaging was conducted using a gradientecho EPI sequence (TR/TE/FA = 600 ms/10 ms/50°, matrix size = 128 × 128, in-plane resolution = 0.3 × 0.3 mm, acceleration factor = 2). An amount of 0.3 mL MR contrast media
(0.15 mmol dimeglumine gadopentetate contrast; Magnevist, Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin,
Germany) was administered in 3 seconds at the seventh measurement. DSC-MRI data were
processed using nICE software (Nordic ICE, NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway). The arterial
input function was semi-automatically obtained from voxels around right MCA (contralateral
to the occlusion side) in each animal, based on criteria including peak height and rising time of
concentration time curve. Relative CBF (relCBF) maps were then generated using a SVD
deconvolution method [18,21]. Brain MR imagines were longitudinally examined in all rats 1 d
before and 2 h and 2 d after MCAO.

Immunohistochemistry
Animals were decapitated at 2 h and 2 d immediately after brain MR scanning. Brains were
dissected out, frozen in powdered dry ice and stored at -80°C. Immunostaining against BDNF,
c-Fos, c-Jun and GFAP in fresh-frozen brain sections was performed with avidin-biotin peroxidase method using a kit (PK-6102, Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) [18,22,23]. Briefly, coronal
sections (20 μm) at the level of striatum covering infarcted brain region of 12 mm in length
were cut on a cryostat at -18°C, and the sections were mounted on glass microscope slides
coated with saline (Muto Pure Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) and stored at -80°C until immunostaining. For immunohistochemistry, a total of 24 sections with an interval of 500 μm were
used. After the fresh frozen sections were fixated in ice-cold acetone, they were incubated overnight at 4°C with the first antibodies and were then reacted for 1 h with the biotinylated second
antibodies. We used 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.02% H2O2 for tissue
staining. The average optical density of immunoreactivity at lesion and non-lesion striatum
and cortex was calculated from the 24 sections per rat, and six rats at each time point were
included for analysis. Negative control sections were prepared from the same tissue blocks by

omitting the specific primary antibodies and using normal, non-immune serum supernatant
from the same sources.
Image-Pro Plus Software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) was used for immunoreactivity calculations. The ratio of the optical density of no treatment and pre-treatment MCAO
rat to the mean value of sham-operation rats was determined for BDNF, c-Fos, c-Jun and
GFAP analyses.

Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed statistically using one-way analysis of variance test followed by Tukey
test. All data used Prism 5 software for statistical analysis (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Values
were considered significant at p < 0.05.

T2-weighted images obtained at 2 d after MCAO (Fig 1). There was no significant difference of
infarction volume between CD34+ pre-treatment and CD34+ post-treatment groups
(134.82 ± 66.59 mm3) and between post-treatment and no treatment groups (p > 0.05).

Experiment 2

Discussion
Recent studies found that HUCB-derived CD 34+ cells might be an effective fraction of cord
blood cells to promote functional recovery through angiogenesis and neurogenesis [2,3]. Taguchi et al. [2,3] reported that systemic administration of CD34+ cells to MCAO mice could
induce neovascularization in ischemic zone followed by endogenous neurogenesis, suggesting
the potential role of neovascularization for neuronal regeneration and functional recovery after
stroke. Nevertheless, Nystedt et al. [2] reported intravenous administration of CD34+ cells after
MCAO might improve functional outcome in rats but did not significantly provide neuroprotection, because CD 34+ cells did not reduce infarction size in either transient or permanent

MCAO. Our study revealed pre-treatment of CD34+ cells can be more effective than post-treatment to reduce infarction volume after MCAO, which is further enhanced with complemental
estrogen treatment in ovariectomized rat.
Estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal women may improve cognitive function
and reduce neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and risk of stroke. Animal study showed
estrogens may reduce mortality and ischemic damage caused by MCAO in ovariectomized rat

infarction volume after permanent MCAO in ovariectomized rats with pre-treatment of estradiol [25]. Our results demonstrated that pre-treatment of estradiol has neuroprotective effect
against ischemic injury, and co-treatment with estradiol and CD34+ cells can exert a synergic
neuroprotective effect after MCAO in ovariectomized rats.

Cord Blood and Estradiol against Cerebral Ischemia

In the present study, we used MR diffusion and perfusion to study the effect of angiogenesis
and neurogenesis of pre-treatment with CD34+ cell and/or estradiol. We found that compared
with no treatment group, pre-treatment with CD34+ cell and/or estradiol could cause significant reduction of infarction volume (T2 image in Fig 2) and brain edema (ADC in Fig 3) after
ischemic injury especially when CD34+ cell and estradiol were co-administrated. The recovery
of the T2 signal in pre-treatment group may indicate a better resolution of vasogenic edema
[16,26], which is typically caused by vascular regulatory dysfunction after blood-brain barrier
disruption. The less ADC signal intensity in pre-treatment group than no treatment group also
indicates resolution of cytotoxic edema [26,27], which is typically caused by cellular metabolic
impairment after ischemia.
Delayed increase in MR signal intensity of both CBF and cerebral blood volume has been
reported to occur from day 1 to 14 in the ipsilateral cortex after transient MCAO in rats [16].
Previous study revealed that postischemic hyperperfusion was neither correlated to the final
infarction nor did it affect the outcome [28], whereas another study reported that postischemic
hyperperfusion was associated with an increased infarction volume [27]. Similar findings have
also been reported and were attributed to increased angiogenesis [16] and vascular regulatory
dysfunction after ischemia [29]. Yang et al. [11] found estradiol exerts neuroprotective effect
when administered after transient MCAO in ovariectomized rats, and this effect of estradiol
was associated with no immediate change in blood flow but with a delayed increase in CBF.
Our study revealed that when compared with no treatment group, there was less reduction of
CBF at 2 h and less hyperperfusion above sham-operation level at 2 d in the 3 pre-treatment
groups, suggesting a reduced postischemic hyperperfusion injury especially in E2+CD34+ pretreatment group.
Previous report showed selected proto-oncogenes including c-Fos and c-Jun could be
increased after MCAO, and pre-treatment of estradiol was reported to differentially regulate cFos after ischemia in ovariectomized rats [14]. However, our study showed that pre-treatment
of estradiol can not only attenuate the expression of c-Fos and c-Jun but also result in further
attenuation when co-treated with CD34+ cells. The increase in c-Fos and c-Jun is found to regulate activator protein-1 binding activity in ischemic cortex, which in turn may link to the
enhanced expression of neurotrophin genes [30]. Postischemic intracerebroventricular infusion of BDNF was reported to prevent neuronal death in vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region
and inhibit astroglial activation and macrophage infiltration which were observed in association with neuronal death [7]. Our previous study revealed that the recovery of neurotrophin
level in ischemic neurons is important for neuronal survival [31]. Our present result showed
that BDNF immunoreactivity recovered well with significant attenuation of immediate early
genes and reactive astrocytosis after ischemia in the 3 pre-treatment groups when compared
with no treatment group.
Our study has some limitations. First, we did not examine the effect of different doses of
CD34+ and estradiol and their combination. It is possible that higher dose of CD34+ or estradiol could be effective alone without the need of combination treatment. The combination of
higher dose of CD34+ and estradiol could also be more effective than the combination of present dose. Second, we did not examine if post-treatment with higher dose of CD34+, estradiol or
combination therapy at different time points could be also effective, since pre-treatment usually has limited therapeutic application. Third, we did not examine different pre- and posttreatment time points to study when could be the best moment to cause significant effectiveness. In the future study, these issues should be carefully examined.

Cord Blood and Estradiol against Cerebral Ischemia

Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that the neuroprotective effect of intravenous administration of
HUCB derived CD34+ cells may act through stabilization of cerebral hemodynamics and normalization of the expression of immediate early genes and BDNF after focal cerebral ischemia.
Estradiol can add a synergic effect to CD34+ cells in the mechanism of neuroprotection.
