Abstract
The stage of brain development at the time of stroke has a
major impact on the pathophysiological mechanisms of
ischemic damage, including the neuroinﬂammatory response.
Microglial cells have been shown to contribute to acute and
subchronic injury in adult stroke models, whereas in neonatal
rodents we showed that microglial cells serve as endogenous
neuroprotectants early following transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion, limiting neuroinﬂammation and injury. In the
neonate, microglial depletion or lack of the scavenger receptor
CD36 exacerbates injury. In this study we asked if lack of
CD36 affects microglial phenotypes after neonatal stroke.
Using RT-PCR we characterized the patterns of gene
expression in microglia isolated from injured regions following

acute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in postnatal
day 10 mice and showed that expression of several proinﬂammatory genes, including Toll-like receptors, remains
largely unaffected in activated microglia in injured regions.
Using multiple biochemical assays we demonstrated that lack
of CD36 alters several functions of microglia in acutely injured
neonatal brain: it further enhances accumulation of the
chemokine MCP-1, affects the number of CD11b+/CD45+
cells, along with protein expression of its co-receptor, Toll-like
receptor 2, but does not affect accumulation of superoxide in
microglia or the cytokines TNFa and IL-1b in injured regions.

It has become apparent over the last decade that inﬂammation is not as one-dimensional or necessarily detrimental after
brain injury, as was traditionally thought (Vexler and Yenari
2009; Iadecola and Anrather 2011). Microglial cells are
major contributors to neuroinﬂammation. In response to
injury they can acquire diverse context-dependent phenotypes; they can become classically activated (so called M1
phenotype) and produce cytotoxic effects or acquire a
supportive phenotype to promote brain repair (so called
M2a phenotype). They can also acquire an immunoregulatory phenotype (so called M2b phenotype) (Schwartz et al.
2006). In adult stroke, microglia traditionally were considered purely toxic, but microglial diversity is being increasingly recognized. Data are emerging that microglia can play
both injurious (Monje et al. 2003; Iosif et al. 2006) and
beneﬁcial (Faustino et al. 2011) role after stroke.
There is now ample evidence that the mechanisms of
ischemic injury differ greatly between immature brain and
adult brain (Yager and Ashwal 2009; Fernandez-Lopez et al.
2014). We recently demonstrated that microglia in fact play a
neuroprotective role in the acute and subchronic injury

phases after neonatal stroke by showing that microglial
depletion exacerbates injury and further enhances production
of inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by stroke
(Faustino et al. 2011). It remains largely unknown how
microglia protect an injured neonatal brain and whether the
entire population or a subpopulation of microglia posses
endogenously proprotective functions.
The scavenger receptor CD36 exerts multiple cell-typespeciﬁc and ligand-speciﬁc functions (Abe et al. 2010;
Silverstein et al. 2010) and is central to several aspects of
microglia/macrophage function, including migratory activity
of these cells, engulfment and removal of neuronal debris and

production of inﬂammatory mediators (Helming et al. 2009;
Hoosdally et al. 2009). The effects of CD36 are contextdependent in injured adult brain, injurious in the experimental
setting of Alzheimer’s disease and adult stroke (Cho et al.
2005; Rahaman et al. 2006; Silverstein et al. 2010) but
beneﬁcial following intracerebral hemorrhage, by facilitating
hematoma resolution by mediating Peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPARg)-dependent phagocytosis
of red blood cells by microglia (Zhao et al. 2007). We showed
that genetic deletion of CD36 enhances ischemic injury in
neonatal brain, in part by diminishing phagocytotic activity of
microglia after acute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO) (Woo et al. 2012). However, the extent of CD36mediated effects on microglial functions in injured immature
brain remains poorly understood. Therefore, we asked if the
microglial phenotypes are predominantly cytotoxic or protective in neonatal mice after tMCAO and whether CD36 alters
these microglial phenotypes.

Materials and methods
Animals
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San
Francisco. Every effort was made to minimize animal suffering.
Mothers were housed in a temperature- and light-controlled facility
and given food and water.
Transient MCAO
Transient MCAO was performed using the Derugin model in postnatal
day 9 (P9)-P10 C57BL/6 wild type (WT; purchased from Charles
River, Hollister, California) mice and CD36 knockout mice on
C57BL/6 background (CD36ko), as we previously described (Woo
et al. 2012). Brieﬂy, a midline cervical incision was made under
isoﬂurane anesthesia, the common carotid artery and internal carotid
artery exposed, single threads from a 7-0 silk suture used to temporary
tie a knot below the origin of the internal carotid artery to prevent
retrograde bleeding from the arteriotomy. A coated 8-0 nylon suture
was advanced 4–5 mm and removed 3 h later. 4°C was maintained.
Microglial cell isolation
Microglial cells were isolated from mice perfused with ice-cold
Ca2+/Mg2+ free Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution. Injured and
matching contralateral regions were dissected on ice, enzymatically
digested using Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit, Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch, Gladbadh,Germany, myelin was removed using myelinconjugated magnetic beads, myelin-free cell fraction centrifuged,
resuspended in 10 lL CD11b+ beads/90 lL degassed buffer and
incubated at 4°C for 15 min. Cells bound to CD11b+-conjugated
magnetic beads were separated using MS column (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch, Gladbadh,Germany).
RT-PCR
Total RNA (1 lg) was extracted (RNase Mini kit; Qiagen, Germantown,MD, USA) from 2 9 105 CD11b+ cells. Reverse transcription
was performed with HotStart Taqâ Plus DNA Polymerase kit

(Qiagen) and PCR was carried out using Bio-rad iCycler; Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA. PCR products were veriﬁed by 2%
agarose gel stained with Ethidium Bromide (EtBr). Quantitative RTPCR was performed using a Biosystem 7900HT Sequence Detection
System and FastStart universal SYBR Green Master (ROS) kit (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA). Gene expression was
quantiﬁed using a modiﬁcation of the 2 DDCT method (Livak and
Schmittgen 2001). Primer sequences were designed using ‘Primer 5’
software and primer BLAST sequences by NCBI: mCD68 (forward
[F]: tagcccaaggaacagaggaa; reverse [R]: ggagctggtgtgaactgtga),
mCd36, transcript variant 3 (Gene ID: 12491; F: gagcaactggtggatggttt;

cctggttgaagctgaccact; R: ttcccactcctaaggcacac), glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (F: acccagaagactgtggatgg; R:
acacattgggggtaggaaca).
Flow cytometry
Single-cell myelin-free suspensions from contralateral and injured
regions were plated (5 9 105/96 well), centrifuged, pellet resuspended in 100 uL blocking buffer containing CD16/32 (1 : 70;
Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) and incubated in 150 uL
Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) staining buffer containing 2% Fetal Bovine Serum.
Cells were ﬁxed (Fixation and Permeabilization kit; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA,California), incubated with antibody mixture
on ice for 20 min, washed, centrifuged, resuspended in staining buffer
and evaluated on BD LSRII ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The
following combinations of antibodies diluted 1 : 200 in FACS
staining buffer were used: anti-CD45-Paciﬁc Blue (Biolegend)/
CD11b-APC-Cy7 (Biolegend)/CD36-Alexa647 (Biolegend)/Mac-2
(Gal-3)-Alexa 488 (Biolegend). Alternatively, a combination of antiCD45-Paciﬁc Blue/CD11b-APC-Cy7/TRL2-PE (eBioscience, San
Diego, CA, USA)/Ly6C-APC (eBioscience) was used.
Compensation beads (BD CompBeads, BD Bioscience,CA,
USA) were incubated in Fixation and Permeabilization solution
(100 uL, 4°C, 20 min), incubated with antibody mixture (4°C,
30 min) and resuspended in staining buffer. Gating and data
analysis were performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland,
Oregon, USA). Live cell scatter, the percentage of CD45low/
CD45medium/CD45high, CD11b+, and TLR2+ were analyzed.
Multiplex cytokine/chemokine assay
Multiplex cytokine/chemokine assay (IL-1b, TNFa, IL-10, MCP-1,
MIP-1a, and KC) was performed in lysates from injured/corresponding contralateral regions using LINCOplexTM mouse cytokine
kit (LINCO/Millipore, Temecula, California, USA), Luminex100
reader (Luminex, Austin, Texas, USA), and StatLIAâ software
(Brendan Scientiﬁc, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with a 5-parameter logistic
curve ﬁtting, as described (Faustino et al. 2011). The results were
normalized to protein concentration in individual lysates.

Superoxide production
Superoxide production was determined by immunoﬂuorescence in
perfusion-ﬁxed brains following administration of a cell-permeable
dye, dihydroethidium (5 mg/kg, i.p. 3 h before sacriﬁce). Cell
identity was determined by Ox-DHE+ co-localization with Iba1+/
Ib4+, as we described (Woo et al. 2012).

Qualitatively, gene expression of CD68, CD36, iNOS, and
arginase-1 was increased but increase in TLR2/3/4 gene
expression was subtle in injured region (Fig. 1b).

Statistical analysis
ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni multiple comparisons test was used
to compare individual variables between contralateral and injured
regions within and between WT and CD36ko groups. Differences
were considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. Results are shown as

Genetic deletion of CD36 affects chemokine accumulation
in injured neonatal brain
We previously demonstrated that lack of CD36 reduces
phagocytosis of neurons undergoing caspase-3-dependent
death after acute neonatal tMCAO (Woo et al. 2012).
Considering that inability to remove apoptotic debris after
injury can enhance neuroinﬂammation, we asked if the levels
of inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines are affected in
injured CD36ko mice.
In WT mice the levels of chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1a,
and KC were signiﬁcantly increased in injured regions 24 h
after reperfusion (Fig. 1c), whereas levels of TNFa remained
below detectible levels in almost all samples in both
hemispheres and the levels of IL-1b were unchanged by
the injury (not shown). In CD36ko mice, injury induced an

additional signiﬁcant increase in MCP-1 but MIP-1a and KC
levels were not signiﬁcantly increased (Fig. 1c). No changes
were observed in IL-1b levels. TNFa levels remained below
detectible levels. There was no signiﬁcant increase in
superoxide levels in Iba1+-microglia either in WT or
CD36ko (Fig. 1d), distinct from reported superoxide accumulation in microglia following tMCAO in adult mice (Cho
et al. 2005) and in our experiments (not shown).
Injury induces pro- and anti-inflammatory genes in
microglia
Various cell types can increase cytokine expression following tMCAO in neonates (Faustino et al. 2011). To determine
the contribution of activated microglia in production of
inﬂammatory mediators we isolated CD11b+ cells from
acutely injured brains. Characterization of the yield and
purity of isolated CD11b+ cells in WT mice showed that
compared to that in contralateral hemisphere, in injured
regions the yield of CD11b+ cells was signiﬁcantly increased
24 h (2.2  0.6 fold, n = 7) and 72 h (3.1  2.2 fold,
n = 8) after reperfusion. We plated isolated CD11b+ cells
and established that the majority of plated cells remain viable
(live/dead assay) and that based on co-labeling with celltype-speciﬁc markers for neurons (NeuN) and astrocytes
(GFAP), there are no NeuN+ cells; microglia are > 99% pure
24 h after plating. A range of morphologies was observed in
microglia from contralateral and injured regions and, as
expected, cells from injured regions were larger, with
frequent presence of ﬁlopodia and lamelopodia (Fig. 2a–c).
While plated at the same densities, number of microglia was
signiﬁcantly higher in injured than in contralateral regions
(1.46  0.45 fold), demonstrating that isolated cells retain
features of activation.
Injury affected expression of pro-inﬂammatory and antiinﬂammatory genes in CD11b+-microglia isolated from WT
pups. Compared to contralateral regions, at 24 h, CD36 signal
varied between individual mice, Arg-1 was markedly
increased, whereas iNOS gene was unchanged in microglia
from injured regions (Fig. 2d). TLR3/4 signals were either
unaffected or decreased in microglia in individual mice,
whereas TLR2 signal remained unchanged (Fig. 2d).
Quantitative RT-PCR 24 h after reperfusion demonstrated
that compared to contralateral hemisphere, there were no
signiﬁcant changes in TLR2, TLR4, arginase-1, iNOS, CD36,
and CD163 gene expression, whereas galectin-3 expression
was signiﬁcantly increased. At 72 h, gene expression of most
antigens, including TLR2, signiﬁcantly increased whereas
expression of TLR3/4 was signiﬁcantly decreased (Fig. 2e).
CD36 deletion affects microglial activation 24 h after
tMCAO
We then determined how lack of CD36 affects the pattern of
CD11b+ and CD45+ accumulation after injury. Considering
that CD36 acts as a co-receptor for TLR heterodimers

(Stewart et al. 2010) and CD36/TLR2 signaling mediates
injury in adult stroke (Abe et al. 2010), we tested whether
lack of CD36 affects TLR2 expression.
In tissue lysates pre-cleared with myelin magnetic beads,
the relative number of CD11b+ cells was signiﬁcantly higher
in injured CD36ko mice (Fig. 3a). Lack of CD36 increased
the number of cells expressing one of its partner receptors,
TLR2 (Fig. 3b) and the number of CD11b+/TLR2+ cells
(Fig. 3c). Expression of a microglial antigen with no known
direct interactions with CD36, Gal-3, was unaffected by lack
of CD36 (not shown). CD11b+ up-regulation was associated
with a shift toward CD45 acquisition, from CD45low to
CD45medium (Fig. 3d–e). Percent of CD45+ cells was significantly increased in injured regions of WT mice (8.6  1.1%
vs. 21.1  3.3%, respectively), and even further in CD36ko
mice (15.4  1.8% vs. 37.7  4.6% in injured regions,
signiﬁcantly higher in injured CD36ko mice; n = 4–6 per
group) but only < 5% of cells in injured regions were
CD45high (Fig. 3h). CD45high cells expressed TLR2 but the
relative number of CD45high/TLR2+ cells was similar in
injured WT and CD36ko mice (Fig. 3g).

Discussion
In this very ﬁrst study focused on how neonatal focal arterial
stroke changes microglial phenotypes, we report a largely
unchanged expression of several inﬂammatory genes, but
increased gene expression of regulatory molecules in
microglial cells isolated from acutely injured neonatal brains,
a pattern consistent with a neuroprotective function of
activated microglia. We also demonstrate that lack of CD36
affects activation of several individual aspects of microglia in
injured regions and dysregulates protein expression of one of
CD36 co-partner receptors, the TLR2 receptor.
Historically, in adult stroke, microglia were viewed as
purely injurious (reviewed in Vexler and Yenari 2009) but
limited tools did not allow discrimination of the effects of
microglial cells from those of monocytes. The diversity of
microglial phenotypes was not sufﬁciently understood. It is
now clear that the origin of microglia and monocytes is
different (Ginhoux et al. 2010) and that the cell origin of
cytokine production, microglia, or monocytes, may have
opposite effects in stroke (Lambertsen et al. 2009). In vitro
studies demonstrated that microglia acquire stimuli-speciﬁc
phenotypes (Chhor et al. 2013). Recent studies have demonstrated that microglial phenotypes undergo marked changes
during late embryonic and postnatal brain development
(Butovsky et al. 2014) and that microglia have unique
features in normally developing brain, playing a key role in
controlling synaptic pruning and the formation of precise
synaptic circuits (Paolicelli et al. 2011; Derecki et al. 2012).
However, microglial phenotypes are insufﬁciently characterized in the normally developing brain and remain unknown
after neonatal stroke.

To characterize changes in microglial gene expression
after injury we chose several antigens that represent cytotoxic
(iNOS), alternatively activated (arginase-1), and phagocytotic and regulatory microglia (CD36, CD163). Knowing that
CD36-mediated ligand recognition and binding to multiple
TLRs is the initial step in TLR activation (Stewart et al.
2010), that CD36-dependent TLR2 signaling modiﬁes injury
in adult stroke (Abe et al. 2010) and that TLRs play a major
role in brain injury in neonates following hypoxia-ischemia
or infection (Mallard et al. 2009), we examined expression
of TLRs. While TLR4 seems purely injurious in stroke (Kilic
et al. 2008), the role of TLR2 is more complex. It can elicit

context-dependent effects – injurious (Abe et al. 2010) or
beneﬁcial (Rolls et al. 2007; Hua et al. 2009) – based on the
type(s) of heterodimers that it forms with other TLRs. In a
hypoxia-ischemia model in neonates, TLR2 agonist does not
affect injury, whereas genetic TLR2 deletion decreases
infarct volume (Stridh et al. 2011). TLR2/3/4 gene expression was not increased in microglia isolated from acutely
injured regions 24 h after tMCAO. Quantitative RT-PCR
showed no signiﬁcant changes for TLR2/3/4 and iNOS at
that point. A variable extent of increase in gene and protein
CD36 expression was evident 24–72 h after injury. These
data are consistent with the notion of the overall non-

cytotoxic nature of activated microglia in post-ischemic
neonatal brain (Faustino et al. 2011). Increased proliferation
of acutely and then isolated plated microglia also suggests
non-cytotoxic microglial phenotypes in our study, as proliferating microglia protect against adult stroke (LalancetteHebert et al. 2007).
We previously showed that after neonatal stroke microglia
protect through at least two mechanisms, removal of
apoptotic debris and controlling neuroinﬂammation (Faustino et al. 2011). The contribution of apoptotic neuronal
death is markedly higher in ischemia-related injury in
neonates than in adults (Hu et al. 2000) and an inability to
remove debris by microglia enhances inﬂammation and
exacerbates injury (Faustino et al. 2011). CD36 participates
in several phagocytotic steps, including recognition, engulfment, and processing of apoptotic cells (Stolzing and Grune
2004; Lucas et al. 2006). Therefore, it is not surprising that

phagocytotic activity of microglia is diminished in CD36ko
after neonatal tMCAO, contributing to more severe injury in
CD36ko (Woo et al. 2012). Another important distinction in
the microglial response is that in adult neurodegenerative
models CD36 toxicity is mediated via robust superoxide
production in microglia/macrophages (Cho et al. 2005;
Rahaman et al. 2006; Abe et al. 2010; Park et al. 2011)
but superoxide production is not increased nearly to the same
extent in activated microglia in neonatal WT mice after acute
tMCAO. Consistent with our previous immunoﬂuorescence
observations that lack of CD36 increases the number and
affects the size of Iba1+ microglia in acutely injured neonatal
brain (Woo et al. 2012), we demonstrate by ﬂow cytometry
that the number of CD11b+ microglia is signiﬁcantly higher
in injured CD36ko. However, the number of CD11b+/
CD45high+ cells, monocytes, remains relatively low regardless of CD36 deletion. Importantly, the number of TLR2+

cells is increased in CD36ko mice, indicating enhanced
CD36-independent TLR2 signaling, but changes are not
because of CD45high+ cells.
The observed CD36-dependent effects may not fully
depend on lack of CD36 in microglia because CD36 is
expressed in several cell types, including endothelial cells,
and signals via multiple ligands and in cooperation with other
receptors. Lack of CD36 signaling in other cells may
ultimately activate microglia. While effects of CD36 in
mediating cell–cell interactions would require further investigation, our results show that altered receptor interactions in
microglial cells affect the modes of microglial activation and
injury after neonatal stroke.
