Analysis of BH3-only proteins upregulated in response
to oxygen/glucose deprivation in cortical neurons
identifies Bmf but not Noxa as potential mediator
of neuronal injury

Stress signaling in response to oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) and ischemic injury activates a group of pro-apoptotic genes,
the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins, which are capable of activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Targeted
studies previously identified the BH3-only proteins Puma, Bim and Bid to have a role in ischemic/hypoxic neuronal injury. We here
investigated the transcriptional activation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins after OGD-induced injury in murine neocortical
neurons. We observed a potent and early upregulation of noxa at mRNA and protein level, and a significant increase in Bmf protein
levels during OGD in neocortical neurons and in the ipsilateral cortex of mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (tMCAO). Surprisingly, gene deficiency in noxa reduced neither OGD- nor glutamate-induced neuronal injury in cortical
neurons and failed to influence infarct size or neurological deficits after tMCAO. In contrast, bmf deficiency induced significant
protection against OGD- or glutamate-induced injury in cultured neurons, and bmf-deficient mice showed reduced neurological
deficits after tMCAO in vivo. Collectively, our data not only point to a role of Bmf as a BH3-only protein contributing to excitotoxic
and ischemic neuronal injury but also demonstrate that the early and potent induction of noxa does not influence ischemic
neuronal injury.

Cerebral ischemia, resulting from occlusion or hemorrhaging
of blood vessels supplying the brain, triggers a complex series
of physiological, biochemical and gene expression changes
ultimately mediating neuronal injury and activation of cell
death mechanisms.1 Outside of the damaged necrotic infarct
core following focal cerebral ischemia, the ischemic penumbra
presents an area of less severe neuronal injury, functionally
impaired but structurally intact, with active cell death pathways
contributing to neuronal injury and loss of neurological function
over time.2 Among pro-inflammatory and other processes,
progressive neuronal injury of the ischemic penumbra is
associated with glutamate-induced depolarization, energetic
stress and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
with the later triggering both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic
signaling in neurons.3,4
Mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis has been shown to be
involved in neuronal cell death after cerebral ischemia in
studies of both patient samples and animal models of acute
stroke,5 with reduced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and
Bcl-w and induction of pro-apoptotic Bax observed within the
ischemic core and surrounding penumbra.6 Translocation of
cytosolic Bax to the mitochondrial outer membrane is key

for the activation of mitochondrial apoptosis in neurons.7–11
This process is inhibited by anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins,12–15 and overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins have demonstrated in vivo neuroprotective
roles against ischemic neuronal cell death.15–17 Bax translocation and membrane insertion eventually results in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the release of
cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic proteins that
trigger caspase-dependent and -independent cell death
processes.18,19 Bax activation is triggered by the transcriptional and posttranslational activation of Bcl-2 homology
domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins that directly activate Bax and/
or indirectly activate Bax by neutralizing the activity of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (‘de-repression’).19–21
A role for several BH3-only proteins, in particular Bid .22,23
and Puma, .24 in ischemic neuronal injury has been previously
suggested in studies using animals deficient in these genes.
Among the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins implicated in
ischemic neuronal cell death, the roles of Bcl-2-modifying
factor (Bmf) and Noxa remain poorly investigated.25 Both are
known to act as indirect activators of apoptosis with roles as
‘de-repressors’, preventing sequestration of direct activators

such as Puma, Bid and Bim by pro-survival Bcl-2 family with
limited effect on cytochrome c release in cellular and isolated
mitochondrial studies.20,26,27 Bmf has been reported to have
roles in cell death in response to anoikis through the inhibition
of Bcl-2 .28,29 and has been shown to be induced under
conditions of hypoxia and through c-jun N-terminal kinase
(JNK) and AMPK activation in response to bioenergetic
stress,30,31 as well as having roles in autophagy and in cell
death induced by inhibition of glucose metabolism.32–34 Noxa
was originally described as a primary p53-response gene and
mediator of p53-dependent apoptosis27 but can also
be transcriptionally induced during ischemia through
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha,35 JNK and AMPK
activation.27,36 This study investigated whether noxa and
bmf are induced in response to oxygen/glucose deprivation
(OGD) in cultured cortical neurons in vitro and in a mouse
model of transient focal ischemic injury in vivo and investigates
the role of these pro-apoptotic genes in mediating neuronal
injury in vitro and in vivo.
Results
Levels of noxa mRNA are increased following OGD in
primary cortical neurons. In order to identify which
pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins may have a role in ischemic
neuronal injury, cultures of neocortical neurons were subjected to OGD in vitro. Mature cultures of neocortical neurons
were subjected to 45 min of OGD and allowed to recover
under normoxic conditions for various timepoints (4, 6, 24 h)

at which points mRNA levels of BH3-only proteins were
assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis.
mRNA levels for noxa were found to be upregulated from 4 h
onward, and levels were maintained significantly up to 24 h at
3.9-fold (Figure 1a). Other markers investigated, including
bim and puma (Figures 1b–d), showed no significant change
when compared with controls. We also observed a delayed,
2.3-fold over-representation in bmf expression 24 h after
OGD; however, this was not within the range of statistical
significance.
noxa and bmf mRNA changes following transient focal
cerebral ischemia. Following the data obtained in vitro from
neocortical neurons, we attempted to validate these results
in vivo in a mouse model of transient focal ischemia. Wildtype (WT) mice were sham-treated or subjected to 60 min
ischemia by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA)
followed by reperfusion for 3, 8 and 24 h, at which time points
mice were euthanized and brains were removed for gene
expression analysis to determine the expression of noxa and
bmf mRNA in the ipsilateral and contralateral cortex. Realtime qPCR analysis determined that noxa mRNA expression
was significantly increased 2.7-fold in the ipsilateral cortex of
animals 3 h following reperfusion and maintained a 2.1- and
1.4-fold increase at 8 and 24 h, respectively, returning
towards baseline (Figure 2a), compared with ipsilateral
cortices of sham-operated mice. Cortical expression of bmf
mRNA was maintained at baseline, 3 and 8 h and increased
1.6-fold at 24 h following reperfusion after MCA occlusion in

the ipsilateral cortex (Figure 2c) compared with shamoperated ipsilateral cortices, but again this did not reach the
level of statistical significance. Contralateral cortical mRNA
expression of mice subjected to transient middle cerebral
artery occlusion (tMCAO) showed no significant difference to
sham-operated contralateral cortices but tended to mirror the
trends observed in the ipsilateral cortex (Figures 2b and d),
consistent with a progressive increase of intracranial pressure due to cerebral edema. These data confirm in vitro
observations of early noxa induction after ischemic conditions, maintained up to 24 h. In contrast, induction of bmf
mRNA, similar to the OGD experiments, was not statistically
significant following cerebral ischemia (Figure 2c).
Deletion of noxa does not confer protection to excitotoxic and OGD-induced neuronal injury in cultured
primary cortical neurons. Early and significant induction
of noxa mRNA observed both in vitro after OGD and in vivo in
response to ischemia prompted investigation of Noxa protein
induction and the effects of deletion of noxa in ischemic
neuronal injury. Levels of Noxa were examined in WT primary
cortical neurons after OGD treatment followed by recovery for
0, 1, 4, 6 and 24 h by western blotting. Controls were shamexposed and maintained under normoxic conditions. Fortyfive minutes of OGD in healthy primary cortical neurons was
sufficient to induce a significant increased expression of Noxa
protein from 0 h after treatment and maintained significantly
up to 24 h (Figure 3a) compared with normoxic controls,
consistent with the observed upregulation of noxa mRNA. As

a positive control for OGD-induced neuronal injury, we
observed a significant increase in the accumulation of
caspase/calpain-mediated II-spectrin breakdown cleavage
products37–39 in cortical neurons after OGD (see below;
Figure 5b).
In order to examine the effects of deletion of noxa in
ischemic neuronal injury, cortical neurons derived from WT
and noxa-deficient mice were sham-treated or subjected to
either 45 min OGD or exposure to N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA)/glycine (100 μM/10 μM) for 5 min and allowed to
recover under normoxic conditions for 24 h. Controls were
sham-exposed and maintained under normoxic conditions.
Assessment of cell death 24 h after OGD treatment (Figure 3b)
or NMDA treatment (Figure 3c) by Hoechst and PI staining
indicated no difference in the cell death levels in WT cortical
neurons subjected to OGD (56.82% ± 1.22) or NMDA
(54.89% ± 1.31) insult compared with noxa-deficient cortical
neurons subjected to OGD (59.17% ± 3.62) or NMDA
(49.47% ± 2.03), demonstrating that no significant protection
is conferred with deletion of noxa in vitro.
noxa-deficient mice are not protected from ischemic
injury in vivo. Next we sought to determine a role for Noxa
in vivo by ischemic infarct assessment in WT compared with
noxa-deficient mice subjected to transient focal cerebral
ischemia. We confirmed no significant difference in age and
weight of the mice at the time of experiment and observed no
significant differences between genotypes in the plasticity of
the posterior communicating artery (PcomA; see Methods).

Assessment of infarct volume was made 24 h following
60 min MCA occlusion with reperfusion by Cresyl violet/Nissl
staining encompassing the cortex and striatum within the
vascular territory of the MCA and expressed as a percentage
of contralateral hemisphere to correct for differences in

the brain size and brain edema. Mice deficient in noxa did
not demonstrate any significant reduction in infarct volume
(Figure 4a), with an infarct volume of 37.2 ± 2.2% compared
with 29.0 ± 1.7% in WT animals (Figures 4a and b).
Neurological deficit scores were also evaluated at 0 h
(Figure 4c) and 24 h (Figure 4d) following ischemia with
reperfusion. There was no significant improvement in
neurological deficits observed in noxa-deficient mice at either
time point examined. Taken together, the above data
demonstrate that the early induction of noxa may contribute
to non-excitotoxic components of neuronal injury but has no
influence neuronal survival after OGD in vitro or ischemic
injury in vivo.
Bmf protein levels are increased following OGD in
primary cortical neurons and focal cerebral ischemia in
mice. To explore a possible increase in Bmf protein
expression following ischemic neuronal injury, levels of Bmf
were examined in primary cortical neurons after OGD
treatment and in the ipsilateral cortex of WT mice subjected
to 60 min ischemia followed by reperfusion for 3 and 24 h by
western blotting. Forty-five minutes of OGD in healthy
primary cortical neurons was sufficient to induce a significant
increased expression of Bmf 24 h after treatment (Figure 5a).
Expression of Bmf was also found to be significantly
increased in the ipsilateral cortex of WT mice at 24 h
following reperfusion after ischemia (Figure 5c).
To confirm initiation of apoptotic cell death resulting from
OGD or ischemia, quantitative western blotting analysis was
also carried out for αII-spectrin proteolysis. αII-Spectrin
proteolysis during apoptosis triggered by cerebral ischemia
has been implicated in hypoxic–ischemic neuronal
injury.37,40,41 Considerable evidence documenting the accumulation of caspase-3- and calpain-mediated αII-spectrin
breakdown products and corresponding decrease of fulllength αII-spectrin protein after OGD in hippocampal slice
cultures in vitro and in the ipsilateral cortex of rodents
subjected to tMCAO injury in vivo provides substantial
evidence supporting the use of αII-spectrin breakdown as a

useful biomarker in models of focal ischemia.37–39 Western
blotting analysis revealed a significantly increased accumulation of the 145 kDa αII-spectrin breakdown product both in vitro
in cortical neurons (Figure 5b) and in vivo in the ischemic
ipsilateral cortex (Figure 5d) at 24 h, indicating the initiation of
calpain/caspase-3-dependent apoptosis as a result of OGD
and focal cerebral ischemia.
Cell death is attenuated in bmf-deficient primary cortical
neuron cultures following OGD. We also examined the
effect of gene deficiency of bmf in in vitro models of neuronal
injury, by OGD and excitotoxic NMDA receptor overactivation
in cortical neurons derived from WT and bmf-deficient mice.
Assessment of cell death 24 h after OGD treatment
(Figure 6a) or NMDA treatment (Figure 6b) by Hoechst and
PI staining indicated significantly reduced cell death in bmfdeficient neurons subjected to OGD (31.4 ± 1.6%) or NMDA
(42.2 ± 2.0%) insult compared with WT cortical neurons
subjected to OGD (45.2 ± 1.0%) or NMDA (56.3 ± 1.15%),
implicating bmf in the apoptotic response to both OGD and
NMDA receptor overactivation. In both experiments, there
was no difference in cell death between WT and bmf-deficient
cells for sham-treated controls.
In order to demonstrate that overexpression of bmf would
reverse the neuroprotective effect observed in bmf-deficient
neurons, cortical neurons derived from WT mice were cotransfected with a vector expressing bmf and an enhanced

green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-expressing vector and
subjected to OGD. Assessment of cell death of eGFPpositive cells 24 h after OGD treatment (Figure 6c) indicated
that overexpression of bmf significantly exacerbated cell death
when compared with control eGFP-transfected neurons.
bmf may contribute to ischemic neuronal injury
in vivo. We then sought to examine the effect of bmf
deletion in vivo, comparing infarct volume in WT mice to bmfdeficient mice after tMCAO. Again, no significant difference in
age and weight of the mice at the time of experiment was
confirmed, and plasticity of the PcomA was observed (see
Methods). Assessment of infarct volume revealed mice
deficient in bmf demonstrated no significant difference in
infarct volume following tMCAO (Figures 7a and b) when
compared with WT. The infarct volume in bmf-deficient mice
was 27.9 ± 1.8% compared with 35.9 ± 5.2% in WT mice;
however, this did not reach the level of statistical significance.
Decreased neurological deficit scoring was also observed
at 0 h (Figure 7c) and 24 h (Figure 7d) following ischemia with
reperfusion, with bmf-deficient mice (Median (interquartile
range), 1.5 (1.0)) showing improved deficits compared with
WT mice (Median (interquartile range), 1.75 (0.5)) at 24 h
(Figure 7d; Po0.05). Two WT mice showed stroke-related
mortality before 24 h. Inclusion of these mice resulted in a
neurological deficit score of 1.5 (1.0) (Median (interquartile
range)) in bmf-deficient mice compared with 2.0 (1.63)

in primary cultured cortical neurons and suggests that bmf
may contribute to ischemic neuronal injury and neurological
deficit outcome in vivo.
Discussion
Hypoxic–ischemic brain injury and associated cellular events
are worthy of particular investigation as a well-known cause of
neuronal cell death and damage. Pathophysiological analysis
after focal brain ischemia reveals a necrotic core area of
irreversible cell death resulting from total bioenergetic failure
due to dramatically reduced metabolic rates of oxygen and
Cell Death and Disease

glucose. Surrounding this necrotic core lies the ischemic
penumbra, an area of less severe damage, functionally
impaired but metabolically active tissue, balanced precariously between a complex schism of endogenous neuroprotective and neurotoxic events.1 Elucidation of the triggers and
mediators of ischemic cell death mechanisms may provide
gene-targeted intervention for neuroprotection in stroke,
preventing ongoing injury and infarct progression.
To this end, our data from the present study indicate that the
pro-apoptotic gene, noxa, although significantly induced, may
possibly not become a relevant therapeutic target for the
treatment of ischemic stroke. Using gene expression
analysis, we observed a robust early induction of noxa mRNA
and a corresponding significant induction of Noxa protein
levels during OGD in cortical neurons. The transcriptional

upregulation of noxa observed by conditions of OGD in vitro
and focal ischemia in vivo is consistent with results reporting
induction of noxa during hypoxia and after transient ischemia
in vivo by Hif1α as a mediator of hypoxic cell.25,35 Hence the
dependence of Noxa induction is not restricted to p53 and
associated regulators;27,36 noxa transcription and expression
can be activated by diverse apoptotic signals in both a p53dependent and independent manner, with numerous regulators and control mechanisms that may be activated to induce
noxa at the transcript level,36 leading to strong upregulation of
noxa mRNA via multiple pathways as observed in our study.
Surprisingly, however, our experiments revealed that gene
deficiency in noxa did not protect against OGD-induced injury
in vitro and that noxa-deficient mice were as susceptible to
ischemic damage as WT littermates. Interestingly, Kim et al.
.35 demonstrated a reduction of infarct volume in a rat model of
focal ischemia by suppression of noxa expression by
antisense oligonucleotides. Disparity in infarct volumes across
models may be a result of experimental design and variation42
or could be due to species differences. It should also be noted
that, despite successful applications of antisense strategies in
gene silencing, the use of antisense oligonucleotides as an
alternative to gene-knockout models in vivo in practice should
be performed with adequate controls to ascertain whether
observed physiological effects are the result of an antisense

mechanism and not from non-specific effects, such as an
intrinsic activity of the phosphorothioate backbone.43
Noxa is known to be poorly apoptotic in some cell types,21,36
and compared with other BH3-only proteins, Noxa demonstrates tethered potential for neutralization of pro-survival Bcl2 proteins, with a more restricted role binding only Mcl-1 and
A1.20,21 In this context, it is interesting to note that targeting of
Mcl-1 by transgenic overexpression of Noxa failed to induce
significant cell death in adenovirus oncoprotein E1A immortalized MEFs or NIH3T3 fibroblasts.26 Indeed, in a comparison
of DNA-damage-induced apoptosis in mice lacking puma and/
or noxa, damage was observed to be cell-type dependent; in
mature CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages, Puma
alone was sufficient to induce apoptosis, while loss of Noxa
alone did not notably protect B or T cells.44 Puma was
demonstrated to have a major role in most cell types studied,
whereas Noxa was only seen to contribute in certain cell types.
Contribution of Noxa to cell death may require cell-type
dependent engagement of other additional pro-apoptotic
factors. Although our analysis has attempted to exclude
potentially mitigating factors, cerebrovascular development,
subtle anatomical or physiological differences could contribute
to our results. However, our data imply that the net effect of
noxa is unlikely to contribute significantly to neuronal death
signaling after cerebral ischemia.

were quantified and presented as a percentage of infarct volume compared with WT-treated mice. (c and d) Neurological deficit scores after induction of tMCAO in WT and bmfdeficient mice at 0 and 24 h following 60 min ischemia with reperfusion. Mice deficient in bmf score were significantly better than WT matched controls after 24 h reperfusion

score, respectively; *Po0.05 compared with WT control. Data are representative of n ≥ 12–13 for each group of WT and bmf-deficient mice

In contrast to noxa, we did not observe a significant
induction of bmf mRNA after OGD or cerebral ischemia.
Subsequent experiments revealed a significant induction of
Bmf protein levels following OGD in cortical neurons and after
ischemic injury in vivo. Of note, experiments performed in
primary cortical neurons indicated a significant protection in
bmf-deficient neurons both in vitro after OGD- and NMDAinduced excitotoxic injury. In contrast, overexpression of Bmf
resulted in significantly exacerbated cell death. bmf deficiency
also demonstrated significantly reduced neurological scores
after ischemic stroke in an in vivo model of tMCAO in mice.
Clearly, it is possible that other BH3-only proteins such as Bid,
Bim and Puma may compensate for a bmf-deficiency
in vivo.22,23,44,45 Of note, bmf mRNA did not appear to be
transcriptionally induced early in response to injury. This
suggested that bmf contributes to neuronal injury via
posttranscriptional activation mechanisms. Bmf is sequestered to the actin cytoskeleton-based myosin V motor complex
through its interaction with dynein light chain (DLC)-2 and is
released in response to stress stimuli to stimulate apoptosis.28
The DLC-binding motif in Bmf closely resembles the region in
Bim that mediates its binding to DLC-1,46,47 and this
interaction with DLC-2 negatively regulates the pro-apoptotic
activity of Bmf;28 the localization of Bim and Bmf to the
microtubules and actin cytoskeleton, respectively, may be
determined fundamentally by their respective DLC partners.
Additionally, Bmf has been shown to be induced posttranscriptionally through enhanced translation under conditions
Cell Death and Disease

that cause repression of the CAP-dependent translation
machinery, including hypoxia.30
Several BH3-only proteins, such as Bid, Bim and Bad,22,48,49
are also constitutively expressed in the brain and rapidly activated
in response to focal cerebral ischemia. Collectively, these results
suggest that bmf activation may contribute to the development of
ischemic neuronal injury; however, there is likely a functional
redundancy observable in BH3-only proteins contributing to
ischemic neuronal injury, with similar lack of protection/tendency
towards protection observed with deletion of puma in focal
cerebral ischemia.24 Investigation of ischemic damage in BH3only protein double-knockout models may be valuable to
determine whether conductive actions of Noxa or Bmf with other
BH3-only proteins occur, as reported in other cell death models.50
Collectively, the present study not only provides evidence for a
role of Bmf as a BH3-only protein contributing to hypoxic/ischemic
neuronal injury but also demonstrated that the early induction of
noxa did not influence neuronal survival or ischemic injury,
suggesting functional redundancy among BH3-only proteins for
ischemia-induced neuronal death or functions of noxa independent of cell death signaling. These findings are important for
future target selection strategies such as neuroprotective
interventions to combat ischemic brain injury.
Materials and Methods
Gene-targeted mice. Animal experiments were carried out under license from
the Department of Health and Children (Ireland) and in accordance with European
Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC). All procedures were reviewed and

approved by local Research Ethics Committee of the Royal College of Surgeons in
Ireland. For the analysis of bmf and noxa expression, targeted bmf and noxa mutant
mice originally generated from C57BL/6-derived Bruce4 ES cells backcrossed onto
a C57Bl/6J background were provided by Professor Andreas Strasser (WEHI,
Melbourne, Australia) and bred as homozygous knockout colonies.32,51 WT C5Bl/6J
mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and
were backcrossed with bmf and noxa WT littermates for 410 generations for
comparison to bmf and noxa-deficient mice
Genotype analysis. WT and knockout alleles for bmf and noxa were
confirmed by PCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted from tail snips using High
Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Genotyping was
performed using the specific primers: 5′-GGAGTTCAGACTTCGCCGAGAG-3′,
5′-GGCTGGTCACAAAGTTTGACACTG-3′ (WT allele-specific); 5′-GGAGTTCAGA
CTTCGCCGAGAG-3′, and 5′-GCAAGAGGCAAGCCCTTCACTTGG-3′ (mutant
allele-specific) for bmf; and 5′-GGAGGGCATAAATGGGCAATGACAC-3′ (common),
5′-GATGCTTCTTGGGTGCACCCACAC-3′ (WT allele-specific reverse), and
5′-AAAGCAATCCCAAACGAC-3′ (mutant allele-specific reverse) for noxa.
Preparation of primary mouse neocortical neurons and cell
culture. Primary cultures of murine neocortical neurons were prepared and
cultured as described previously52 with modifications. Briefly, hysterectomies of
embryonic day 16–18 pregnant female WT, bmf- and noxa-deficient mice were
carried out following cervical dislocation and embryonic cerebral cortices transferred
to dissection medium on ice (PBS with 0.25% glucose and 0.3% BSA). The tissue
was incubated in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C, and trypsinization was
stopped using media containing sera. Neurons were dissociated by gently pipetting
and centifugated at 300 × g for 3 min, and the media containing trypsin was
aspirated. Neocortical neurons were triturated in fresh plating medium (MEM
containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 100 U/ml penicillin/
streptomycin, 0.5 mM L-glutamine and 0.6% D-glucose). Cells were plated on
poly-D-lysine-coated plates at 2 × 105 cells/cm2 and maintained at 37 °C and 5%
CO2 humidified atmosphere. After 24 h, medium was exchanged for 1 : 1 plating
medium and feeding medium (Neurobasal media containing 100 U/ml penicillin/
streptomycin, 2% B27 and 0.5 mM L-glutamine) containing 600 nM cytosine
arabinofuranoside. At DIV (days in vitro) 3, medium containing cytosine
arabinofuranoside was exchanged for fresh feeding media. All in vitro experiments
were performed on mature cultures at DIV 8–12.
Plasmids and transfection. Primary cortical neurons (DIV 10) were
transfected using calcium phosphate.53 For overexpression of bmf, cells were
transfected with a plasmid encoding murine bmf (generously provided by Professor
A Villunger, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria).30 A plasmid with
enhanced GFP (eGFP-N1; Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) was used to
allow the identification of transfected neurons for cell death assays. Cells were used
for experiments 48 h after transfection.
Oxygen–glucose deprivation. Healthy primary cortical neuron cultures at
DIV 8–9 transferred to a hypoxic chamber (COY Lab Products, Grass Lake, MI,
USA) with an atmosphere comprising 1.5% O2, 5% CO2 and 85% N2, with
temperature maintained at 35 °C. Feeding medium was removed from cultures and
replaced with preequilibrated, deoxygenated OGD medium bubbled with N2 for 1 h,
consisting of (in mM): 0.3 CaCl2, 70 NaCl, 5.25 NaHCO3, 70 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4,
2 MgSO4, 10 sucrose, pH 6.8. After 45 min of OGD, cultures were returned to
oxygenated feeding medium and allowed to recover for 24 h under normoxic
conditions (21% O2 and 5% CO2). Sham-treated cultures were transferred to
oxygenated glucose-free medium consisting of (in mM): 2 CaCl2, 125 NaCl, 25
NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgSO4, and 10 sucrose, pH 7.5 and
maintained under normoxic conditions (21% O2 and 5% CO2).54 Control cultures for
protein and gene expression analysis were maintained under normoxic conditions.
NMDA toxicity and determination of neuronal injury. Cortical
neurons cultured on 24-well plate for DIV 8–9 were sham-treated or subjected to
a model of excitotoxic injury induced by NMDA receptor overactivation37 by
exposure to NMDA/glycine (100 μM/10 μM) for 5 min and washed twice in
experimental buffer containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 0.4 KH2PO4, 20 HEPES,
5 NaHCO3, 1.2 Na2SO4, 1.2 CaCl2, and 15 glucose, pH 7.4, supplemented with
high Mg2+ (1.2 mM).

Neuronal injury resulting from OGD, NMDA excitation or Bmf overexpression was
assessed after 24 h in each model by staining neocortical neurons live with Hoechst
33258 at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml and propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) dissolved in culture medium after 24 h for 10 min at 37 °C. After incubation,
nuclear morphology was assessed using an Eclipse TE 300 inverted microscope
(Nikon Instruments, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and × 20 NA 0.45 dry objective.
Images were taken using a SPOT RT SE CCD camera (SPOT Imaging Solutions,
Sterling Heights, MI, USA) and the appropriate filter sets. For each time point and
treatment, nuclei uniformly stained with Hoechst were counted as viable and
condensed, and PI-positive nuclei were scored as dead neurons and expressed as a
percentage of the total population, three subfields captured per well, with a minimum
of three wells analyzed per condition. Images were processed using NIH Image J
(Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). All scoring was
carried out in a blinded manner.
Gene expression analysis using real-time RT-PCR analysis. Total
RNA was extracted from primary cortical neurons after OGD treatment in vitro or
from murine cerebral cortex 3, 8 and 24 h after 60 min transient MCA occlusion
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). First-strand cDNA synthesis
was performed using 1 μg of total RNA as template and reverse transcribed using
Superscript II (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) primed with 50 pmol random
hexamers. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the Applied Biosystems
7500 Real-Time PCR System in a MicroAmp optical 96-well reaction plate with
optical covers (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) and the QuantiTech SYBR
green PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Sense and
antisense primers used were as follows: 5′-CAACACAAACCCAAGTCCT-3′ and
5′-CATTTGCAAACACCCTCCTT-3′ for bim; 5′-CCCATAAGCCAGGAAGACAA-3′
and 5′-CTGAAGCTTTCTGGCGATCT-3′ for bmf; 5′-TCAGGAAGATCGGAG
ACAAA-3′ and 5′-TGAGCACACTCGTCCTTCAA-3′ for noxa; 5′-ATGGACTCAGC
ATCGGAAGG-3′ and 5′-TGGCTCATTTGCTCTTCACG-3′ for puma; and 5′-G
GGTGTGATGGTGGGAATGG-3′ and 5′-GGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGG-3′ for
β-actin. The data were analyzed using the Analysis AB 7500 SDS Software
(Applied Biosystems), and the generation of specific PCR product was confirmed by
melting curve analysis. Data were presented as mean ± S.E.M.; all samples were
normalized to β-actin levels and expressed as n-fold expression relative to matched
controls for n = 3 separate experiments carried out in triplicate.
Protein extraction and western blotting. Tissue and cell pellets were
lysed in ice-cold radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer (25 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM
NaCl, 1% NP40, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate)
followed by sonication of tissue on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 10 000 × g for
10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were used for western blotting. Resulting
membranes were probed with a mouse monoclonal α-fodrin (αII-Spectrin) antibody
(clone AA6; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, 1 : 1000), rat anti-Bmf monoclonal
antibody (a gift from A Villunger, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria;
1 : 500), rabbit anti-Noxa polyclonal antibody (ab23563; Abcam, Cambridge, UK,
1 : 2000) or a mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma, 1 : 5000). Species-specific
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Pierce, Rockford, IL,
USA, 1 : 5000) were detected using the Super-Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Pierce) and imaged using a FujiFilm LAS-3000 imaging system
(FujiFilm, Sheffield, UK).
Evaluation of PcomA plasticity. Evaluation of the PcomA plasticity was
carried out in male WT, bmf- and noxa-deficient mice aged 8–10 weeks (20–24 g)
as described55 without ischemia. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with
Pentobarbital Sodium (Dolethal; 200 mg/kg), and transcardial perfusion fixation
was performed with 20 ml 10 U/ml heparin in Ringer’s solution and 20 ml 4% PFA
followed by Cresyl Violet (5%, 1 ml). The plasticity of the bilateral PcomA was
evaluated independently by a blinded investigator (GC) using a dissecting
microscope and graded on a qualitative scale of 0–3 as follows: Score 0, no
anastomosis between posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and superior cerebellar artery
(SCA); Score 1, anastomosis between PCA and SCA in capillary phase; Score 2,
small truncal PcomA; and Score 3, truncal PcomA. Statistical significant differences
were analyzed using non-parametric statistics; no significant difference in PcomA
plasticity was observed in bmf- or noxa-deficient versus WT control mice, n46 per
genotype (Fisher’s exact test). The median score of PcomAs were (Median
(interquartile range)) 1.0 (0.75) for noxa-deficient mice, 2.0 (0)) for bmf-deficient
mice and 1.0 (1.75) for WT mice.

Focal cerebral ischemia model. Induction of transient focal cerebral
ischemia was performed in male WT, bmf- and noxa-deficient mice aged
8–10 weeks (20–24 g) using the monofilament suture method as described56,57 with
modifications. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 5% isoflurane 30% O2 and 65%
N2O and maintained with 2% isoflurane, 33% O2 and 65% N2O for the duration
of surgery (o20 min). Body temperature was maintained normothermic at
36.8–37.4 °C via a feedback-controlled heat blanket. A silicon-coated 8-0 nylon
monofilament with rounded tip was introduced into the left internal carotid artery and
advanced past the carotid artery bifurcation to occlude the MCA. After 60 min, the
suture was removed to allow reperfusion. To control for effects of occlusion,
sham-treated mice underwent the same surgical procedure, but the filament was not
advanced to occlude the vessel. Effective occlusion and assessment of
microcirculatory function was monitored by laser-Doppler flowmetry with a probe
fixed to the exposed left parietal skull for continuous monitoring of regional cerebral
blood flow (Perimed 5001 Master, Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden). Mice were
euthanized 3, 8 and 24 h after reperfusion, and the brains were processed either
for bmf and noxa expression analysis or for calculation of infarct volume. All surgical
procedures were carried out in a blinded manner.
Determination of ischemic infarct volume. Infarct volume was
assessed 24 h after ischemia by a blinded investigator; 10 μm coronal sections
(n = 16) from each brain were cut by Leica CM1950 Cryostat (Leica Biosystems
Nussloch GmbH, Heidelberger Str, Germany) and taken at 500μm intervals.
Sections were stained with Cresyl violet/Nissl, and infarct area was evaluated
quantitatively using an image analysis system by a blinded investigator (Leica
Application Suite V3, Germany). Lesion volume was calculated as previously
described57 by the infarct area multiplied by the section thickness and summed over
the entire brain for direct infarct volume and corrected for edema of infarcted tissue
for indirect infarct volume. Data are expressed as the percentage of contralateral
hemisphere to correct for differences in the brain size and brain edema.
Neurological deficit. Neurological deficit scores were assessed as described
previously.22 Briefly, the neurological function of mice was evaluated for severity by a
blinded investigator (GC) at 0 or 24 h after ischemia using a five-point scale, as
follows: Score 0, no deficit; Score 1, weakness of the contralateral forepaw; Score 2,
circling; Score 3, loss of righting reflex; and Score 4, no motor activity. In a separate
analysis, stroke-induced death of the animal was scored as 5.
Statistical analysis. Statistics were carried out on an SPSS-IBM software
(IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). mRNA and densitometry data are presented as
mean ± S.E.M. and were analyzed by using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s
post hoc test to determine statistical significance. P-values o0.05 were considered
to be statistically significant. Infarct volumes were analyzed using non-parametric
analyses (Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric analysis, Mann–Whitney U-test); Fisher’s
exact test was used to compare significant differences in PcomA plasticity and
neurological deficit scores. Significance was accepted at Po0.05.
