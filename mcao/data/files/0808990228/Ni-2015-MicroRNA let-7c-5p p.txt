a b s t r a c t
The present study was designed to reveal the potential role of let-7c-5p, a highly conserved miRNA in
stroke. We found that the content of let-7c-5p was signiﬁcantly decreased in the plasma of patients with
ischemic stroke as well as in experimental animals. Moreover, we also observed a signiﬁcant decrease of
let-7c-5p in ipsilateral cortex and striatum in mice that were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) at 24 h reperfusion. Overexpression of let-7c-5p via ICV injection decreased the infarction
volume and attenuated the neurological deﬁcits, and most interestingly, inhibited microglial activation.
To further explore the mechanism, we checked let-7c-5p expression in BV2 cells and primary microglia in
an OGD condition and in LPS-induced microglial activation. The results indicated that decreased let-7c-5p
was evidenced in the activated microglia. Overexpression of let-7c-5p in BV2 cells remarkably inhibited
the microglial activation. The inhibition of microglial activation by overexpression of let-7c-5p was also
observed in mice with experimental stroke, which is in line with the decreased infarction volume and
improved neurological deﬁcits. We identiﬁed that let-7c-5p directly targeted to the 30 -untranslated
region of the caspase 3 mRNA to reduce caspase 3 levels, which may underline the miRNA – modulated
microglial activity. The present study revealed that suppression of microglia activation by let-7c-5p overexpression may be involved in the protection effects of ischemic damage.
The mechanism may include the miRNA-mediated caspase 3 pathway.

1. Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that
bind to the 30 untranslated regions of target mRNAs to induce transcript degradation and/or inhibit translation (Tan et al., 2009).
miRNAs play important roles in various pathophysiology processes
(Eacker et al., 2009; Sorensen et al., 2014). Let-7c is one of the most
abundant and highly conserved miRNAs (Lagos-Quintana et al.,
2002). Previous research on let-7c has primarily focused on functions and roles in cancer. It has been shown that let-7c inhibits
cancer cell survival by regulating cell proliferation (Bjorner et al.,

2014) and apoptosis (Zhan et al., 2013). Recent studies suggest that
let-7c is an important regulator of macrophage polarization. The
overexpression of let-7c in GM-BMM (M1 macrophages) decreases
the expression of M1 phenotype signature genes including iNOS,
TNF-a and IL-6, and the inhibition of let-7c in M-BMM (M2 macrophages) contributes to M1 polarization (Banerjee et al., 2013).
Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability globally (Goldstein et al., 2001; Wang and Shuaib, 2002)
and represents a major public health problem. Enormous efforts
have been made to elucidate the pathological mechanisms that
underlie ischemic brain injury and to identify targets for stroke
therapies. To these ends, the targeting of stroke-induced neuroinﬂammation is emerging as an attractive strategy for stroke treatment (Ceulemans et al., 2010; Seifert and Pennypacker, 2014;
Taylor and Sansing, 2013). After ischemic stroke, an inﬂammatory
response that involves the activation of the resident brain microglia is initiated within a few hours (Denes et al., 2007) and persists

76

for months. A variety of pro-inﬂammatory mediators, including
cytokines and chemokines, are present in the ischemic brain following stroke. On one hand, these mediators exacerbate neuron
damage, on the other hand, they over-activate microglia and thus
lead to a vicious circle (Wang and Shuaib, 2002). Recent studies
have revealed that post-stroke neuroinﬂammation is a key determinant of acute outcomes and long-term prognoses (McColl
et al., 2009; Pan et al., 2014). The suppression of microglial activation following stroke can reduce brain injury and therefore represents an attractive therapeutic strategy for stroke (Pena-Philip
pides et al., 2014; Yilmaz and Granger, 2008). Emerging evidence
suggests that miRNAs are altered in the rodent brain and human
plasma following cerebral ischemia. However, the contributions
of miRNAs to post-stroke neuroinﬂammation remain to be elucidated. Based on the previous ﬁnding that let-7c exerts robust
effects on macrophage-mediated inﬂammation, in the present
study, we investigated whether microRNA let-7c-5p, which is a
member of let-7c family, affects ischemic brain injury by altering
microglia-mediated post-stroke neuroinﬂammation.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Blood samples from acute stroke patients
Eight male patients (50–70 years of age) diagnosed with acute
cerebral infarction according to clinical information and
MRI/Head CT analysis were enrolled in the Department of
Neurology of the Afﬁliated Second Hospital of Suzhou University
from January to June 2014. All patients with a National Institutes
of Health Stroke Scale score of 5–15 were examined within 48 h
after the event happened. An equal number of age-matched
healthy individuals were enrolled as control groups. Everyone
involved in this experiment was able to understand and approved
the informed consent. Blood was collected from each patient for
assessment.
2.2. Experimental animals
Male CD-1 mice weighing 25–30 g were purchased from SLAC
Laboratory Animals (Shanghai, China). The mice were housed
under a ﬁxed circadian rhythm with free access to food and water.
All the animals used in these experiments were under the guidance
of NIH for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All the experiments were approved by Institute animal welfare committee of
Soochow University. Enormous efforts have been made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used
in the experiments.

2.4. Behavioral test
Three independent behavioral tests (Rotarod, Corner and mNSS
tests) were performed to assess the neurological deﬁcits following
MCAO. As indicated in animal experimental design (Fig. 2A), 3 days
after intracerebroventricular injection, the animals were trained
for 2 days, 1 day prior to the MCAO, ﬁrst behavioral test were monitored, the tests continue to perform 1–4 days after MCAO model.
Brieﬂy, the modiﬁed neurological severity scores (mNSS) was
graded on a scale of 0–18, and mice that were unable to perform
the test or lacked the tested reﬂexes were awarded a score, the
details can be found in Supplemental Table 1. The higher score
the mice awarded, the more serious the lesion is. In the corner test,
the mice were forced to enter a corner made of two cardboard
pieces with an angle of 30°. Both sides of the vibrissae were stimulated when the mice entered deep into the corner, which caused
the mice to rear and turn back to the open end. The MCAO mice
preferentially turned toward the impaired side, and non-ischemic
mice exhibited no left or right preference. The numbers of left
and right turns over ten trials were recorded. The more numbers
of right turns, the more serious the lesion is. In the rotarod test,
the mice were placed onto a rotarod that increased in speed from
5 to 40 rpm. The trial ended when the mouse fell off the device, and
the time that the mouse remained on the rotarod was recorded.
The shorter time of the mice remained on rotarod, the more serious
the lesion is. More details about these behavioral tests can be
found in previous publication of our group (Jin et al., 2014).
2.5. Let-7c-5p mimics, control mimics and intracerebroventricular
injection
The let-7c-5p mimics and control mimics were prepared by
GenePharma (Shanghai, China) with the following sequences:
let-7c-5p (50 –30 ), sense: UGAGGUAGUAGGUUGUAUGGUU, antisense: CCAUACAACCUACUACCUCAUU; and control mimic (50 –30 )
sense: UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT, antisense: ACGUGACACGUU
CGGAGAATT. The in vivo transfection was performed according
to the method described as follows: The stereotaxic coordinates
were 0.5 mm posterior and 1.0 mm lateral to bregma and 2.5–
3.0 mm ventral to the surface of the skull. The control and
let-7c-5p mimics (2.5 lg/2.5 ll) were added to 1.25 ll of
Entranster TM in vivo transfection reagent (Engreen, Beijing,
China) (Tan et al., 2014). The solution was mixed gently, left for
15 min and then injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) using a
micro syringe (Hamilton, Nevada, USA) under the guidance of the
stereotaxic instrument (RWD Life Science).
2.6. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) neuron-conditioned medium
preparation

2.3. Animal model of focal cerebral ischemia
Cerebral ischemia was induced by reversible middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO) via an intraluminal suture technique, as
previously described (Pena-Philippides et al., 2014). Brieﬂy, in this
technique, isoﬂurane was used to anesthetize the mice, and their
body temperatures were sustained at 37.0 ± 0.5 with warming
pads. Blood ﬂow was monitored with a laser Doppler probe that
was afﬁxed to the skull. The right common carotid and external
and internal carotid arteries were exposed to insert a
silicon-coated nylon monoﬁlament with a heat-blunted tip (diameter 0.22 ± 0.02 mm). The tip of the ﬁlament was advanced to reach
the origin of the middle cerebral artery as indicated by a numerical
reading measured by laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (<30% of the baseline). The surgical site was sutured when the entire operation
was completed. To initiate reperfusion, the ﬁlament was withdrawn one hour after the surgery.

Primary cultured cerebral cortical neurons were exposed to
OGD for 2.5 h in OGD buffer (NaCl: 4.09 g; KCl: 186.5 mg; CaCl2:
111 mg; HEPES: 2.38 g; Glycine: 1.125 g. Dissolved in 500 ml double distilled water), the OGD buffer was replaced with neurobasal
medium when OGD is over and the supernatants were collected
after 24 h of reperfusion (OGD neuron CM). Supernatants from
non-OGD cultured neurons were collected as negative controls
(No-OGD neuron CM).
2.7. Cell culture, let-7c-5p mimic transfection and OGD
Primary mouse microglia was derived from the cerebral cortices
of the 1–2 days old ICR mice. Mouse primary neurons were obtained
from the cortices of fetuses at GD 18. In brief, mixed glial cultures
were prepared from the cerebral cortices of 1–2 days old ICR mice;
the cortices were chopped and dissociated by mechanical disruption

J. Ni et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 49 (2015) 75–85

using a nylon mesh. After ﬁltrating with 70 lm sieve, the dissociated
cells were seeded in poly-D-lysine-coated ﬂasks or plates, and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. For primary microglia cultivation, the culture medium were replaced every 3 days with
DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS. Fourteen days later, the
microglia was isolated from the mixed glial cells by shaking the
ﬂasks in a table concentrator at 200 rpm for 4 h at 37 °C. The purities
of the cultured microglia exceeded 95% as determined by CD11b
immunostaining (data not shown). For primary neuron cultivation,
the culture medium was replaced with neurobasal supplemented
with 2% B27 after incubation with DMEM/F12 supplemented with
10% FBS for 6 h. The culture medium was half replaced every 2 days.
The murine BV2 microglial cells were cultured in high-glucose
DMEM with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum,
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were
cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/air environment. Let-7c-5p mimics
(100 nmol/L) or control mimics were transfected into the BV2 cells
for 48 h using RNAiMAX (GenePharma) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
2.8. Histological assessments of the brain damage following MCAO
24 h and 96 h after MCAO, we evaluated the infarct volumes
with triphenyl-2,3,4-tetrazolium-chloride (TTC) histology. Six days
after injection of let-7c-5p mimic or the control mimic, the MCAO
model was performed. After 24 and 96 h of reperfusion, the brains
were cut into four 2-mm-thick slices and subsequently incubated
in saline containing 1% TTC (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 37 °C for
10 min. Next, the slices were ﬁxed in PB buffer containing 10%
formaldehyde for 24 h and then scanned, and digital image analysis software (Sigma Scan Pro, Jandel, San Rafael, CA) was used to
analyze the infarct sizes across all of the slices.
2.9. Immunohistochemistry
24 or 96 h after MCAO, the mice were anesthetized and ﬁrst
perfused with saline followed by ﬁxation with buffered
paraformaldehyde (4%). The brains were removed and post-ﬁxed
in 4% paraformaldehyde; the paraformaldehyde was then removed
and replaced with 30% sucrose solution overnight. A cryostat was
used to cut the ischemic lesion (+1.18 to 0.10 mm from bregma)
into 16-lm-thick coronal sections for immunoﬂuorescence staining. The slices were blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA, 10% goat
serum and 0.3% Triton-X 100. Next, the slices were incubated with
the following primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: goat anti-Iba1
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and rabbit anti-NeuN (Millipore,
Billerica, USA), rabbit anti-MAP2 (Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, USA).
Next, the slices were washed with 0.01 M PBST for 3 times and
then incubated in a 1:400 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat
anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) for
2 h at room temperature and washed with 0.01 M PBST. Then,
the slices were stained with 0.2 lg/ml hoechst staining solution
(Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed. The quantiﬁcation of the immunostaining was performed as follows. Brieﬂy,
every 10th section was collected for quantiﬁcation for a total of 4
sections, and four pre-assigned ﬁelds from each section were used
for analysis with Image J. The data are presented as the mean ﬂuorescence intensity of Iba1 positive cells of the analyzed tissue.
2.10. Isolation of RNA and quantitative real-time PCR
RT-PCR was performed to detect the let-7c-5p levels in the
plasma of the normal controls and stroke patients and the plasma
and brain tissues of the MCAO mice. Total miRNA was isolated
using mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kits (Ambion, America), and
miRNA reverse transcription was performed with TaqMan

77

MicroRNA Reverse transcription Kits (AB, America). The expressions of the matured mouse miRNAs were determined with a
stem-loop real-time PCR system using TaqMan Universal Master
Mix II, no UNG (AB, America). Regarding the analyses of the
mRNA levels of iNOS, TNF-a, IL-6 and COX-2, the RNAs were isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen, America), and 1 lg of RNA was
reverse-transcribed into cDNA using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kits (AB, America). The cDNAs were ampliﬁed using
the following speciﬁc primers: iNOS, forward primer: 50 -CAGGAG
GAGAGAGATCCGATTTA-30 , reverse primer: 50 -GCATTAGCATGGAA
GCAAAGA-30 ; TNF-a, forward primer: 50 -CATCTTCTCAAAATTCGA
GTGACAA-30 , reverse primer: 50 -TGGGAGTAGACAAGGTACAACC
C-30 ; COX-2, forward primer: 50 -CAGGCTGAACTTCGAAACA-30 ,
reverse primer: 50 -GCTCACGAGGCCACTGATACCTA-30 ; IL-6, forward primer: 50 -GCAATGGCAATTCTGATTGTATG-30 , reverse primer: 50 -AAGGACTCTGGCTTTGTCTTTCT-30 ; 18S, forward primer:
50 -GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-30 , reverse primer: 50 -CCATCCAATC
GGTAGTAGCG-30 . Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using
SYBR Premix II. The expressions of the target genes were normalized to 18S and quantiﬁed relative to the expression in the control
groups. The 2DDCT formula was used for the calculations of the
relative quantiﬁcations.
2.11. Western blot analysis
BV2 cells were transfected with let-7c-5p mimic or scrambled
negative control for 48 h, the cells were then treated, respectively,
with LPS (200 ng/ml), OGD, CM (conditioned medium from OGD
neuron culture) for 24 h. After washes with PBS for 3 times, the
cells were lysed in triple-detergent lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were determined with protein assay kits (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). Sixty micrograms of protein from each sample were separated
by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8%) and transferred
onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes or nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Five percent skim milk was
used to block the membranes for 2 h. The membranes were subsequently incubated with the following primary antibodies: polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse iNOS (Abcam, NT); polyclonal rabbit
anti-mouse COX-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); monoclonal
anti-rabbit caspase-3 (Cell Signaling); and monoclonal
anti-a-tubulin mouse ascites ﬂuid (Sigma). The membranes were
then incubated with secondary antibodies (Sigma–Aldrich). The
protein bands were visualized with a ChemiScope 3300 Mini
(CLINX, Shanghai, China).
2.12. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
To measure TNF-a and IL-6 in the ischemic brain and supernatant from cultured BV2 cells. Ipsilateral and contralateral cortices collected from MCAO or sham-operated mice were
prepared, each sample was homogenized by ultrasonic wave in
RIPA buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The homogenates were centrifuged
at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. BCA protein assay kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) was used
to measure the protein concentration of the supernatant from tissue and cultured cells for normalization. TNF-a and IL-6 were measured with commercial ELISA kits (Boster Biosciences Co., Wuhan,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Microplate
Reader (Inﬁnite M200 PRO, Tecan, Switzerland) was used to assess
the OD value.
2.13. Luciferase activity assay
The constructs that cloned into a 79 bp fragment from the
30 -UTR of the caspase 3 gene (containing the potential

78

J. Ni et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 49 (2015) 75–85

let-7c-5p-targeting site at 117–196) and the mutated 30 -UTR of the
seed region of the let-7c-5p binding site were synthesized by
GenePharma. HEK-293 cells (2  104/well) were seeded into
24-well plates and cotransfected with 0.5 lg of the luciferase
reporter gene construct and 1 ll miRNA mimic (50 lM) using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the Fireﬂy and
Renilla luciferase signals were determined using the
dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Fireﬂy luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity for each transfected well. Three
independent experiments were performed in triplicate.
2.14. Statistical analyses
One-way ANOVAs followed by Bonferroni tests were utilized for
multiple-group comparisons. The Student’s t test was used for
comparisons between two groups. A P value < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Let-7c-5p was decreased in the patients with ischemic stroke and
in the mice following experimental stroke
We measured the circulating levels of let-7c-5p in the ischemic
stroke patients and the healthy controls with qRT-PCR. Compared
to the healthy controls, the let-7c-5p levels were markedly reduced
in the plasma from the patients with acute ischemic stroke
(Fig. 1A). Consistently, the mice that were subjected to MCAO also
exhibited signiﬁcantly lower plasma levels of let-7c-5p after 6 and
24 h reperfusion compared to the mice that received the sham
operations (Fig. 1B). Moreover, at 24 h after reperfusion, the
let-7c-5p levels in the ipsilateral cortices and striatum were also

remarkably reduced compared to the let-7c-5p levels in the contralateral hemispheres of the MCAO mice and compared to the
levels in the corresponding regions of the sham-operated mice
(Fig. 1C and D). These results suggest that the expressions of
let-7c-5p were signiﬁcantly decreased in the plasma, cortex and
striatum following cerebral ischemia.
3.2. Overexpression of let-7c-5p protects against ischemic brain injury
in the mouse MCAO model
To investigate the effects of let-7c-5p following MCAO, we
over-expressed let-7c-5p by ICV injection of the let-7c-5p mimic.
Scrambled mimics that did not target any miRNA were injected
as a control. 6 days after the injections, we used RT-PCR to conﬁrm
that let-7c-5p was overexpressed in the cortices and striatum of
the mice that receiving the let-7c-5p mimic compared to the mice
that received the scrambled mimic (Fig. 2B). The mice that received
the let-7c-5p mimic and those that received the control mimic
were subjected to 1 h of MCAO at 6 days after the injections.
After 1 day of reperfusion, the mice that received the let-7c-5p
mimic exhibited signiﬁcantly smaller infarct volumes in the cortex,
striatum and ipsilateral hemisphere than did the mice that
received the scrambled mimic (Fig. 2C). Moreover, three behavioral
tests were performed to monitor the functional deﬁcits over the
ﬁrst 4 days following MCAO. The mNSS results revealed that the
let-7c-5p mimic-treated group achieved lower scores than did
the control mimic-treated groups (Fig. 2D). The let-7c-5p
mimic-treated group also performed better in the corner and
rotarod tests (Fig. 2E and F). We also examined the effects of
let-7c-5p over-expression on infarct damage at 4 days following
MCAO with TTC histology. As shown in Fig. 2C, mice receiving
let-7c-5p mimics displayed smaller infarct volumes than that of
mice receiving NC mimics. We further performed MAP2 and

NeuN staining to assess brain infarct damage following MCAO
(Dawson and Hallenbeck, 1996; Kim et al., 2015). The results qualitatively showed that let-7c-5p over-expression remarkably
increased both MAP 2 and NeuN positive cells in the ischemic brain
at 4 days following MCAO (Supplemental Fig. 1 and 2).
3.3. Overexpression of let-7c-5p inhibits neuroinﬂammation in the
ischemic brain following MCAO
Following cerebral ischemia, the expressions of various proinﬂammatory cytokines are tremendously increased in the ischemic
brain. To investigate the effects of let-7c-5p on neuroinﬂammation,
we used qPCR to evaluate the expressions of proinﬂammatory

cytokine mRNAs in the ischemic cortex. The overexpression of
let-7c-5p resulted in signiﬁcant inhibitions of the expressions of
IL-6, COX-2, TNF and iNOS mRNAs in the cortical penumbra compared to the mice that were injected with the scrambled NC mimic
(Fig. 3A). By using Western blot and ELISA approaches, we further
conﬁrmed that the ischemic induction of iNOS, TNF-a and IL-6 in
the ischemic cortex was attenuated by the overexpression of
let-7c-5p (Fig. 3B). Paralleled to these results, immunoﬂuorescence
analysis also showed that MCAO robustly activated the microglia
in the ipsilateral cortex, as evidenced by the remarkably enhanced
immunoﬂuorescence intensity of Iba 1 staining, which was significantly attenuated in the ipsilateral cortices of the mice treated
with the let-7c-5p mimic (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results

Immunohistochemistry with IBa1 and NeuN antibodies revealed reduced microglial activation (green) and increased number of neuron (red) in the let-7c-5p mimic group
compared to the NC mimic group. Statistical analyze of microglial mean ﬂuorescent intensity was conducted by Image J. The values are presented as the means ± the SEMs of
5 mice per group. **P < 0.01 vs. the ischemic hemisphere of the MCAO mice pre-treated with NC mimic. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure legend, the

suggest that the protection conferred by let-7c-5p overexpression
was likely mediated by the inhibition on post-ischemic
neuroinﬂammation.
3.4. Expression of let-7c-5p was reduced in the activated microglia
Following cerebral ischemia, resident microglia and peripheral
macrophages are rapidly activated and mobilized to the injury site
to mediate neuroinﬂammation in part by producing and secreting
various inﬂammatory mediators. Therefore, we used cultured
microglia to investigate the effects of let-7c-5p on microglia-m
ediated neuroinﬂammation in vitro. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the
major component of the walls of gram-negative bacteria, is a
well-established activator of microglia/macrophages (Tao et al.,
2014; Xu et al., 2015). We treated the BV2 microglial cell line
and mouse primary microglia with LPS (200 ng/ml). Compared to
the vehicle treatment, both the BV2 cells and the primary microglia
exhibited a signiﬁcant decrease in let-7c-5p expression in response
to LPS stimulation at 24 h post-treatment (Fig. 4E and F). To better

mimic in vivo ischemia, we further examined let-7c-5p expression
in BV2 cells and primary microglia in an OGD condition, which is a
well-established cellular ischemia model. It has been reported that
microglia are activated by conditioned media collected from
OGD-treated primary neuronal cultures. Thus, we treated BV2 cells
and primary neurons with conditioned media collected from
OGD-treated primary neuronal cultures. After 24 h of incubation,
the expression of let-7c-5p was remarkably reduced in the BV2
cells and primary microglia compared to the levels observed in
the control microglia that were not treated with conditioned media
and compared to the cells that were treated with conditioned
media collected from neuronal cultures that were not subjected
to OGD (Fig. 4C and D). The BV2 cells and primary microglia were
further directly exposed to 3 h of OGD. At 24 h after reoxygenation,
let-7c-5p expression was reduced in the OGD-treated primary
microglia and BV2 cells compared to the control BV2 and primary
microglia that did not undergo OGD treatment (Fig. 4A and B).
Collectively, these results indicate that let-7c-5p expression was
decreased following microglial activation induced by three

different stimuli, including two stimuli that closely mimicked cerebral ischemia in vitro. These results imply that the reduction in
let-7c-5p expression was not stimulus-speciﬁc but was likely a
universal aspect of microglial activation. Thus, reduced let-7c-5p
expression might contribute to microglia-mediated neuroinﬂa
mmation.
3.5. Overexpression of let-7c-5p suppresses the expressions of proinﬂammatory mediators in activated microglia
To investigate whether the reduced expression of let-7c-5p following microglial activation plays an important role in
microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation, we transfected BV2 cells
with let-7c-5p mimic or scrambled NC mimic. The BV2 cells displayed about 692.8 ± 160.2 (95% credit interval 1369 to 15.09)
times of let-7c-5p expression compared to the control cells that
were transfected with NC. 48 h after transfection, then the BV2
cells were activated with LPS. Compared to the cells that underwent scrambled mimic transfection, the LPS-induced expressions
of the mRNAs of the pro-inﬂammatory mediators (iNOS, COX-2,
TNF-a and IL-6) in the BV2 cells were signiﬁcantly inhibited by
let-7c-5p overexpression (Fig. 5A). At the protein level, we further
conﬁrmed that let-7c-5p overexpression attenuated LPS-induced
iNOS, COX-2, TNF-a and IL-6 expression (Fig. 6A and B).
We next investigated whether let-7c-5p overexpression suppressed microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation following OGD
treatment. BV2 cells transfected with let-7c-5p or scrambled
mimic were incubated in conditioned medium collected from neuronal cultures that were or were not subjected to OGD 48 h after
transfection. Consistent with previous reports, we also observed
that the condition medium collected from the OGD-treated neuronal cultures remarkably activated the BV2 microglia as evidenced by the induction of the expressions of the mRNAs of
various proinﬂammatory mediators (i.e. iNOS, COX-2, TNF-a and
IL-6) in the cells that were treated with the OGD-conditioned medium compared to the control cells that were not treated with

conditioned medium and the cells that were incubated with condition medium collected from non-OGD-treated neurons. The
expressions of pro-inﬂammatory mRNAs that were induced by
OGD-conditioned medium were signiﬁcantly attenuated by the
let-7c-5p mimic but not the scrambled mimic (Fig. 5B). At the protein level, Western blot and ELISA results further conﬁrmed that
the OGD-conditioned medium induced iNOS, COX-2, TNF-a and
IL-6 expression, and these expressions were inhibited by
let-7c-5p overexpression (Fig. 6C and D).
Finally, BV2 microglia was directly subjected to 3 h of OGD 24 h
after transfection with miRNA mimics. Enhanced expressions of
iNOS, COX-2, TNF-a and IL-6 mRNAs were observed 24 h after
re-oxygenation, which suggests that the OGD activated the microglia in vitro. As expected, the overexpression of let-7c-5p mimic
but not the scrambled mimic suppressed the expressions of the
iNOS, COX-2, TNF-a and IL-6 mRNAs that were induced by OGD
(Fig. 5C). Moreover, Western blot conﬁrmed that let-7c-5p overexpression inhibited these protein expressions induced by OGD
(Fig. 6E and F).
3.6. Let-7c-5p reduced caspase 3 expression in the microglia by
targeting the 30 UTR of caspase 3
In general, miRNAs act as post-transcriptional regulators of
gene expression by targeting the 30 UTR regions of target mRNAs
(Olde Loohuis et al., 2012). Thus, we investigated the potential
gene targets of let-7c-5p using TargetScan. Among all of the predicted targets, caspase 3 was chosen as a candidate because previous research has shown that caspase 3 is involved in the control of
microglial activation (Burguillos et al., 2011). To determine
whether let-7c-5p targeted caspase 3, we transfected BV2 cells
with let-7c-5p mimic or scramble mimic. As shown in
Fig. 7A and B, the overexpression of the let-7c but not the scramble
mimic diminished the mRNA and protein expressions of caspase 3.
Using TargetScan, we identiﬁed a binding site in the 30 UTR of
the caspase 3 mRNA that was potentially targeted by let-7c-5p

(Fig. 7C). To obtain further direct evidence that caspase 3 is a target
of let-7c-5p, the 30 UTR of caspase 3, which contains nucleotides
that are complementary to let-7c-5p (nucleotides 153–160 of the
caspase 3 30 UTR) was cloned into the PGL3-promoter vector (WT)
in which the 30 UTR of caspase 3 was placed downstream of a luciferase reporter gene. We further mutated three nucleotides in this
seed-region of the 30 UTR of caspase 3 that were complementary to
let-7c-5p. The mutant 30 UTR was cloned into the same site of the
PGL3-promoter vector. Plasmids containing the wild-type or
mutant caspase 3 30 UTR were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells
with the let-7c-5p mimic. As shown in Fig. 7D, let-7c-5p overexpression downregulated the luciferase activity in the HEK 293 cells
that were transfected with the plasmids containing the wild-type
30 UTR of caspase 3. Finally, we examined whether let-7c-5p inhibited microglial activation by targeting caspase 3 in the BV2 cells. As
shown in Fig. 7E, both pro-caspase 3 and cleaved caspase 3 levels
were inhibited by let-7c-5p overexpression but not by scramble
NC overexpression in the LPS-treated BV2 cells. These results indicate that let-7c-5p reduced caspase 3 expression in the microglia
by targeting this binding site in the 30 UTR of caspase 3.

4. Discussion
The present study presented two important ﬁndings. First, we
showed that the levels of the let-7c-5p miRNA were decreased in
the plasma of patients with ischemic stroke and in the plasma

and brains of mice following experimental stroke. Furthermore,
we showed that overexpression of let-7c-5p in the brain not only
signiﬁcantly reduced brain infarct damage but also improved the
functional deﬁcits following cerebral ischemia, suggesting that
let-7c-5p is a promising candidate for the treatment of ischemic
stroke. Secondly, the overexpression of let-7c-5p inhibited
microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation in both the in vivo and
in vitro ischemic models and attenuated caspase 3 expression in
the microglia. These results imply that the protective effects of
let-7c-5p following cerebral ischemia are likely mediated by the
inhibition of microglial activation via translational repression of
caspase 3.
Quantitative PCR revealed that the let-7c-5p level was
decreased in the plasma of patients with ischemic stroke within
24 h. Consistent with this clinical ﬁnding, we detected decreased
expression levels of let-7c-5p in the plasma of mice during the
acute phase following MCAO, a well-established rodent ischemic
stroke model. Moreover, we observed that let-7c-5p expression
levels were also remarkably reduced in the ischemic cortex and
striatum. To the best of our knowledge, our results from both
human stroke patients and animal models of stroke suggested,
for the ﬁrst time, that let-7c-5p likely contributes to stroke pathogenesis. To test the hypothesis that overexpressing let-7c-5p represents as a novel therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke,
let-7c-5p mimic was administered via ICV injection. As expected,
the let-7c-5p mimic signiﬁcantly attenuated cerebral ischemic
injury, as evidenced by the markedly decreased infarct volumes

in and improved performance of the mice treated with the
let-7c-5p mimic at 24 h and 4 days after MCAO. Taken together,
our results indicate that stroke-induced let-7c-5p reductions contribute to ischemic brain injury and that the overexpression of
let-7c-5p is a novel strategy for stroke treatment.
Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion trigger microglial activation,
which leads to proinﬂammatory responses and thus essentially
contributes to secondary brain ischemic injury. Therefore,
post-ischemic neuroinﬂammation is thought to be a good target
for stroke therapies. Given the fact that let-7c-5p plays an important role in the regulation of macrophage-mediated inﬂammation
(Banerjee et al., 2013), we investigated the effect of let-7c-5p on
microglia-mediated
neuroinﬂammation
following
cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion. First, in the in vivo mouse MCAO model,
we observed that let-7c-5p overexpression signiﬁcantly

suppressed neuroinﬂammation in the ischemic brain as evidenced
by the fact that let-7c-5p overexpression decreased microglial Iba1
staining and attenuated the MCAO-enhanced expression of several
pro-inﬂammatory mediators. Moreover, by using primarily cultured microglia and the BV2 microglial cell line, we further investigated whether let-7c-5p expression was reduced in activated
microglia and whether the overexpression of let-7c-5p attenuated
microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation. To this end, three different paradigms were applied to activated microglia in vitro; i.e.,
LPS stimulation, direct OGD stimulation and stimulation with
OGD-conditioned neuronal buffer. Speciﬁcally, the latter two
in vitro models have been used to mimic the in vivo activation of
microglia following cerebral ischemia (Hu et al., 2012; Li et al.,
2013). In accordance with the in vivo results, let-7c-5p levels were
remarkably decreased in the activated microglia, and let-7c-5p

overexpression blunted the activation-induced production of
proinﬂammatory mediators. The results were validated in primary
microglia and BV2 cells that were activated by LPS, OGD or
OGD-conditioned neuronal medium. Thus, microglial activat
ion-induced reduction in let-7c-5p expression and the contribution
of let-7c-5p to microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation were independent of the activation model. Taken together, our results from
both in vivo and in vitro experimental stroke models suggest that
the inhibition of microglial activation and the related inﬂammatory response is likely a mechanism that underlies the protective
effect of let-7c-5p following cerebral ischemia.
It is well accepted that miRNAs act through post-transcriptional
mechanisms to regulate gene expression by targeting the 30 UTR
regions of the target mRNAs. We used TargetScan to identify caspase 3 as the target gene of let-7c-5p. Experimentally, the overexpression of let-7c-5p signiﬁcantly decreased the mRNA and protein
levels of caspase 3 in the BV2 microglia. Moreover, the results from
the luciferase reporter gene assay suggested that let-7c-5p targeted the 30 UTR region of caspase 3 to decrease the mRNA levels
of the target gene. Taken together, these results suggest that caspase 3 is the target gene whose expression is regulated by
let-7c-5p.
Currently, the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of
let-7c-5p on post-ischemic neuroinﬂammation remain unclear.

The Let-7 miRNAs are initially identiﬁed from the study of developmental timing in Caenorhabditis elegans (Rougvie, 2001). Then,
let-7 miRNAs are predicted or have been conﬁrmed experimentally
in a wide range of species, including human and mouse. Recently,
several reports showed that let-7c-5p promoted alternative activation (M2 polarization) while inhibited proinﬂammatory (M1) activation of macrophages of macrophages (Banerjee et al., 2013;
Zhang et al., 2015), indicating that let-7c-5p is an important mediator regulating inﬂammation. Moreover, several downstream
mediators, such as p21-activated kinase 1 and the transcriptional
factor C/EBP, have been implicated in let-7c-5p effects on macrophage polarization.
In this study, we provided experimental evidence that caspase 3
is the target gene whose expression in microglia was
down-regulated by let-7c-5p. Caspase 3 is well recognized as the
key protease in apoptosis (Boland et al., 2013). Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that caspase 3 is an important regulator of microglia/macrophage inﬂammation independent of its role
in apoptosis. For instance, caspase 3 is activated and contribute to
microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation in several neurodegenerative disease models (Burguillos et al., 2011). Moreover,
pan-caspase inhibitors suppress neuroinﬂammation following
cerebral ischemia (Fricker et al., 2013; Kim and Li, 2013). Caspase
3 has also been reported to be activated in microglia polarized to

J. Ni et al. / Brain, Behavior, and Immunity 49 (2015) 75–85

the M1 phenotype. Knockdown of caspase 3 inhibits M1 polarization of microglia through the protein kinase c (Burguillos et al.,
2011). Thus, caspase 3 is a critical mediator that promotes M1
polarization of microglia. We observed that the expression of caspase 3 in microglia was down-regulated by let-7c-5p, suggesting
that let-7c-5p inhibited microglia-mediated neuroinﬂammation
post ischemia by suppressing caspase 3 expression. Further
research is needed to explore how let-7c-5p inhibit
stroke-related neuroinﬂammation by targeting caspase-3.
In conclusion, the present study showed that let-7c-5p expression was reduced following stroke and that overexpression of
let-7c-5p protected the brain from ischemic damage by inhibiting
post-stroke microglial activation possibly via a mechanism that
involved the regulation of caspase 3 expression. Moreover, our
study suggests that the use of let-7c-5p as miRNA-based stroke
therapy is an interesting prospect.
