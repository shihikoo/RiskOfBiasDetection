Abstract
Limb remote ischemic conditioning (LRIC) provides a physiologic strategy for harnessing the body’s endogenous
protective capabilities against injury induced by ischemia–reperfusion in the central nervous system. The aim of the
present study was to determine if LRIC played a role in protecting the retina from ischemia–reperfusion injury. A total
of 81 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to sham and ischemia/reperfusion with or without remote
LRIC arms. The retinal ischemic model was generated through right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and
pterygopalatine artery occlusion for 60 min followed by 1, 3, and 7 days of subsequent reperfusion. LRIC was conducted
immediately following MCAO by tightening a tourniquet around the upper thigh and releasing for three cycles.
Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin in order to quantify the number of cells in retinal ganglion
cells (RGCs) layer throughout the duration of the study. Cellular expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
was detected and examined through immunohistochemistry. Protein expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was also analyzed by Western blot techniques. Our study demonstrated
that the loss of cells in RGC layer was attenuated by LRIC treatment at 3 and 7 days following reperfusion (P < 0.05).
Immunohistochemistry studies depicted a gradual increase (P < 0.05) in GFAP levels from day 1 through day 7
following ischemia and subsequent reperfusion, whereas LRIC reduced GFAP levels at 1, 3, and 7 days postreperfusion.
In addition, LRIC increased the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 at day 1 and 3 following ischemia/reperfusion. This particular
study is the first remote conditioning study applicable to retinal ischemia. Our results strongly support the position that
LRIC may be used as a noninvasive neuroprotective strategy, which provides retinal protection from ischemia–reperfusion
injury through the upregulation of antioxidative stress proteins, such as Nrf2 and HO-1.

Our study attempts to analyze the role of astrocytes and cellular
pathways, which influence the severity of ischemia/reperfusion
injury (Eng et al., 2000). Retinal ischemia promotes increased
proliferation and differentiation of astrocytes. The increase in
astrocyte activity following ischemia causes an increase in glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) transcription and translation. In
addition to GFAP, Nrf2 and HO-1 are protective cellular responses
against neurologic ischemia and stroke. Nrf2 is a basic leucine
zipper transcription factor that is found in most cells of the human
body (Moi et al., 1994). Nrf2 is responsible for regulating the
expression of multiple genes involved in antioxidant and cellular
protective genes during periods of oxidative stress, such as ischemia/
reperfusion injury (Shelton & Jaiswal, 2013). HO-1, a hemeoxygenase 1, is one of the downstream effector enzymes of the
Nrf2 pathway. HO-1 is a stress-responsive isoenzyme, which
protects cells from programmed cell death. Each of these modalities could be addressed through separate cellular mechanisms and

Retinal ischemia is a common clinical entity, which remains a substantial contributor to visual impairment and blindness (Osborne
et al., 2004). Retinal ischemia manifests itself through a variety of
diseases, such as ischemic optic neuropathy, obstructive retinopathy,
carotid artery occlusive disease, and glaucoma (Verma, 1993;
Flammer et al., 2002; Osborne et al., 2004). Many studies have
demonstrated that timely reperfusion remains the only effective
treatment pertaining to retinal ischemia (Osborne et al., 2004).
In addition, other studies have demonstrated that reperfusion with
oxygenated blood following ischemia potentiates ischemic damage
through reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Li et al., 2012). The current
literature offers no effective and definitive treatment recommendations
protecting the retina from ischemia–reperfusion damage.

therapies. Clinical interventions could be targeted toward controlling
and modulating these protective cellular responses.
Several studies have demonstrated that ischemic conditioning
protected retinal function and histology from ischemia–reperfusion
injury, when applied before experimental retinal ischemia (preconditioning) and after (postconditioning) reperfusion (Fernandez et al.,
2009b; Dreixler et al., 2011a,b). The preconditioning and postconditioning initiate and potentiate endogenous protective mechanisms, which subsequently diminish reperfusion injury through
neutralizing ROS (Zhang et al., 2002; Obolensky et al., 2008).
Fernandez et al. determined that local ischemic postconditioning
reduced retinal ischemia–reperfusion injury (Fernandez et al.,
2009a,b). However, there are significant limitations pertaining to
local ischemic conditioning due to the characteristics and properties of inducing ischemic conditioning in vital organs, such as
the heart or brain (Veighey & Macallister, 2012). A major breakthrough in the clinical applicability of ischemic conditioning surfaced with the discovery of remote ischemic conditioning, which
possesses a systemic protective phenotype (Veighey & Macallister,
2012). The protective mechanism of ischemic conditioning can be
explained by the idea that transient nonlethal ischemia and reperfusion of one organ or tissue confer resistance to a subsequent
episode of lethal ischemia reperfusion injury in an isolated organ
(Hausenloy & Yellon, 2008). Many groups have confirmed and
defended the effectiveness of LRIC against ischemia/reperfusion
injury in the central nervous system (Zhao, 2009; Hoda et al.,
2012). We have also reported that limb ischemic perconditioning
ameliorated neuronal injury in a focal ischemic stroke rat model
(Ren et al., 2012). Recently, we have shown that repeated daily
remote conditioning by limb ischemia prevents recurrent stroke in
humans (Meng et al., 2012). Thus, the aim of the present study was
to examine whether limb remote per-conditioning in conjunction
with post-conditioning prevents retinal ischemia–reperfusion injury
through the modulation and analysis of GFAP, Nrf2, and HO-1.

Materials and methods
Subject
A total of 81 adult male Sprague-Dawley (280 to 320 g) rats were
used in this study. Animals were housed in the same animal care
facility throughout the duration of the study with a 12-h light/dark
cycle. Animal care was carried out in accordance with guidelines
approved by the Capital Medical University. All efforts were made
to minimize any suffering and to reduce the total number of animals
used.

Retinal ischemic injury model
Anesthesia was induced and maintained with 1.5–3.5% enflurane
in 70% nitrous oxide and 30% oxygen (Bickford veterinary anesthesia equipment model no. 61010, AM Bickford Inc., Wales
Center, NY). The rats were orally intubated and mechanically
ventilated (Rodent Ventilator Model 683, Harvard Apparatus Inc.,
Holliston, MA). Retinal ischemic injury was generated by a 60-min
right middle cerebral artery and pterygopalatine artery occlusion,
using an intraluminal filament as described previously (Block
et al., 1997). The right common carotid artery and the right external
carotid artery (ECA) were exposed through a midline neck incision. The occipital artery and thyroid artery were separated from
surrounding fascia and subsequently ligated by electrocoagulation.

Zhang et al.
The ECA was dissected distally, ligated, and coagulated along with
the terminal lingual and maxillary artery branches. A minimal incision was made in the ECA stump, at an angle of incidence, with
iridectomy scissors. Following the incision, occlusion of the
MCA was made by a heparinized intraluminal filament (0.28 mm,
rounded tip), which was introduced via the ECA. In addition to the
MCAO, the pterygopalatine artery was permanently ligated. The
core body temperatures were monitored with a rectal probe and
maintained at 36.8–37.2 °C throughout the duration of the experiment using a heating pad and lamp. The middle cerebral artery was
occluded for 60 min with subsequent reperfusion. Physiological
variables, such as blood pressure and blood gases (pH, pO2, and
pCO2), were monitored before and after surgical procedures
through the cannulated right femoral artery (Table 1). The fundus
oculi was visualized using an ophthalmoscope, which provided
definitive verification of the retinal ischemia. Visualizing retinal
blood flow interruption and observing the conjunctiva, iris and
retina transitioning to a pale color throughout the MCAO confirmed the effectiveness of the ischemic event. Rats that did not
display the aforementioned ischemic fundus oculi changes were
removed from the study.

Remote postconditioning
Rats were assigned to three groups, as depicted in Fig. 1.
Perconditioning (PerC) (Ren et al., 2012) was initiated immediately following the onset of retinal ischemia by occluding blood
flow to the hind limbs bilaterally. Hind limb occlusion was accomplished by tightening a tourniquet (8 mm) around the upper thigh for 3
cycles, with each occlusion or release phase lasting 10 min (Fig. 1A).
Postconditioning began on the second postoperative day and was
conducted every day thereafter. Rats were anesthetized with a smaller
dose of sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and
received the remote postconditioning, as previously described (Wei
et al., 2011). The same duration of sodium pentobarbital treatment
was applied to the sham and ischemia control groups.

Histopathological examination and immunohistochemical
analysis
The rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and were subsequently
sacrificed by transcardiac perfusion with physiological saline followed
by 4% paraformaldehyde containing phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) (pH 7.4). The bulbus oculi was removed and postfixed in the
above solution. Paraffin sections were prepared and examined by
light microscopy. The cells within the retinal ganglion cell (RGC)
layer were quantified, as previously described and modified (Fernandez
et al., 2009b). Six cell regions of interest (ROI) were selected (around
200 μm from the optic nerve head) and the cells were counted in the
ROI (Fig. 1C). The quantitative analysis is expressed by the average
number of six cell regions (per unit length 200 μm). The cells within
the RGC layer were examined and quantified in a blinded manner at
days 1, 3, and 7 following retinal ischemic injury.
Several sections were also utilized for immunohistochemical
analysis. Sections were deparaffinized with 1% H2O2 in distilled
water for 10 min followed by 5% normal goat serum. The sections
were subsequently incubated with antibodies against GFAP (dilution
1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) in PBS containing
0.03% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 48 h. They were subsequently
incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (dilution 1:500,
Beijing ZhongShan Inc., Beijing, China) for 2 h and further incubated

ZhongShan Inc., Beijing, China) for 1 h at room temperature. GFAP
was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride.
Microscopic observations were made using a Nikon 80i microscope
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

(P = 0.035). Furthermore, the cell number within the RGC layer of
the control group decreased at day 7 (11.4 ± 1.7) compared with
that at day 3 (14.3 ± 2.3) (P = 0.046). In addition, more cells were
preserved in the LRIC-treated group at day 7 (14.2 ± 1.7) (P = 0.025).
There was no observed difference in the total retinal thickness
between the control and LRIC-treated groups (Table 2).

Immunoblot analysis
Retinas were promptly dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were isolated from the retinas, as
described previously (Shah et al., 2007). Samples containing equal
amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 12.5% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). The
membrane was probed with antibodies specific for Nrf2 (dilution
1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and HO-1 (1:200,
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). The specific reaction
was visualized through the use of a chemiluminescent substrate (GE
Healthcare, UK). GAPDH was used to verify equal HO-1 loading and
lamin B, a nuclear marker, was used to verify equal Nrf2 loading. The
mean amount of protein expression from the sham rat was assigned
a value of 1 to serve as a reference value. Target gene expression
was represented as the fold-difference with respect to the control.

Alteration of GFAP
In order to fully elucidate and characterize the morphologic protection induced by LRIC, retinal immunoreactivity for GFAP was
analyzed at day 1, 3, and 7 following injury. In nonischemic retinas,
astrocytes localized within the nerve fiber and the ganglia cell layer
elicited minimal labeling (Fig. 3B). Whereas, 90 min of ischemia
induced an increase in retinal astrocyte GFAP levels, which spread
to glial processes from the inner limiting membrane to the outer
retina, associated with activated Müller cells (Fig. 3C). In addition,
the GFAP immunoposition increased as the time of the reperfusion
increased (Fig. 3C, 3E, 3G). LRIC significantly decreased the levels
of GFAP in Müller cells compared with those observed in the control
group (Fig. 3D, 3F, 3H).

Expression of oxidative stress-induced proteins
Statistical analysis
Primary quantitative data were compiled and charted in Excel and
the statistical analysis was applied using SPSS for Windows, version
17.0 (SPSS Inc.). For two-group comparison, ANOVA and posthoc
S-N-K tests were used to determine significance. Charts display
means and standard deviation. In all cases, P < 0.05 was the criterion
for significance.

Results
Histological protection by LRIC
The ischemic retina displayed disorganization and cell loss in the
RGC layer 1 day after injury. These changes deteriorated at day 3
and 7 (Fig. 2A, 2C, 2E) following the retinal ischemic insult.
Histological examination of the retina showed that the number
of cells in the RGC layer significantly decreased through the 7 days
(Fig. 2G). The aforementioned ischemic changes were significantly diminished by LRIC from day 3 through day 7 (Fig. 2B, 2D,
2F, 2H). The number of cells in the RGC layer appeared to be more
in the LRIC-treated group compared to the control group at day 1;
however, the difference between the two groups was not statistically
significant (P > 0.05) (Fig. 2H). At day 3, the number of cells in the
RGC layer was significantly greater (17.2 ± 2.8) in the LRICtreated group compared to those in the control group (14.3 ± 2.3)

Nrf2 and HO-1 were analyzed by Western blot in rat retina for each
of the experimental groups at day 1 and 3 after retinal ischemia/
reperfusion (Fig. 4). When compared to the sham-operated group,
Nrf2 protein expression slightly increased in the retinal ischemic
group at day 1, but did not reach a statistically significant level.
However, LRIC significantly (P < 0.000) increased the expression
of Nrf2, as compared to sham group and non-treatment ischemic
group (P < 0.000), at the same time point. At day 3, LRIC significantly increased Nrf2 expression (3.6 ± 0.5), as compared to the
ischemic group (2.8 ± 0.5) (P = 0.007) (Fig. 4A and 4B). The
LRIC group demonstrated a large and significant increase in HO-1
expression at day 1 (2.6 ± 0.6), as compared to the sham (1.1 ± 0.1)
(P < 0.000) and the ischemic non-treatment groups (1.6 ± 0.3)
(P = 0.00). In addition, LRIC performed on day 3 significantly
increased HO-1 expression (3.3 ± 0.1), as compared to sham
(1.1 ± 0.1) (P < 0.000) and ischemic groups (2.1 ± 0.7) (P = 0.008)
(Fig. 4C and 4D).

Discussion
The results from this study indicate that remote ischemic per- and
post-conditioning applied to the hind limbs ameliorated the retinal
ischemia/reperfusion injury. LRIC decreased the GFAP levels from
day 1 to 7 compared to the untreated ischemic rats. In addition,
LRIC increased the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 at day 1 and 3
following ischemia/reperfusion.

Ischemic conditioning can be applied before ischemia (preconditioning), during ischemia (per-conditioning), or after the onset
of reperfusion (post-conditioning) (Hausenloy & Yellon, 2011). In
this study, one time limb remote perconditioning combined with
daily postconditioning for up to day 7 was applied to rats with retinal
ischemia/reperfusion injury. It was previously reported that remote

perconditioning applied to the arm, by blood pressure cuff inflation,
during ambulance transport (i.e., during ischemia) increased the mean
and median salvage indexes (Botker et al., 2010). In our recent study,
we demonstrated that repeated daily remote perconditioning by limb
ischemia prevents recurrent stroke in humans (Meng et al., 2012). Wei
et al. reported that a single early episode of remote perconditioning
reduces infarct size after myocardial infarction, and repeated remote
postconditioning further reduces adverse left ventricular remodeling
and improves survival in a dose-dependent fashion (Wei et al., 2011).
Our present study further demonstrates that combining remote
ischemic per- and post-conditioning results in retinal ischemic tolerance. These descriptions refer to the well-established protective effects
of remote conditioning, when delivered during ischemia in several
organ systems, such as the retina (Saxena et al., 2010). In this study,
our results indicate that the neuroprotection of LRIC may confer
additional benefits to damaged ganglion cells by repeating the limb
ischemia on a daily basis. LRIC may ultimately prove to be a simple,
widely accessible, and potentially cost effective therapeutic strategy
that improves retinal ischemia outcomes for patients.
To further demonstrate the protective role of LRIC, GFAP immunoreactivity was studied. Müller cells that do not express GFAP under
physiological conditions are known to express GFAP in pathological
situations (Osborne et al., 1991; Jadhav et al., 2009). The physiological process of ischemia/reperfusion induced a significant alteration
in Müller cells, as shown by an increase in GFAP immunoreactivity
secondary to ischemia/reperfusion injury (Fig. 3C, 3E, 3G). LRIC
reduced GFAP levels of Müller cells at day 1, 3, and 7 after reperfusion. Fernandez et al. reported that postconditioning offered neuroprotection at day 7; however, there was no significant protection observed
at day 1 (Fernandez et al., 2009b). We believe the difference, in regard
to the protective effect, may be related to our chosen ischemia model
and the performance matter of ischemic conditioning. It is plausible
that combining perconditioning during ischemia and postconditioning
daily might enhance the protection of ischemic conditioning, although
further evaluation with a control group is needed to confirm this
assumption. As previously mentioned, HO-1 induced in Müller cells
plays a protective role in retinal ischemia–reperfusion injury in rats
(Arai-Gaun et al., 2004). It is plausible that the increased expression of
HO-1 in the LRIC group diminished the ischemia/reperfusion injury,
which subsequently reduced the GFAP expression in Müller cells.
A multitude of cellular and molecular mechanisms have been
associated with the per- and post-conditioning, which include
reduction of free radical generation, inhibition of inflammatory
pathways, cellular signaling pathways, and regulation of mitochondrial function (Zhao & Vinten-Johansen, 2006; Zhao, 2009). The
retina is highly susceptible to oxidative damage by ROS. ROS are
generated within the CNS in response to the oxygen burst, induced
by recanalization of anoxic tissue. During the pathological events
of retinal ischemia, the imbalance between the production of ROS
and the ability to scavenge these ROS by endogenous antioxidant
systems is exaggerated. In this study, our data showed that LRIC
upregulated the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 (Fig. 4), which play

Remote conditioning protects against retinal injury

a significant role in detoxifying ROS. Nrf2 has been reported to
be a key regulator in cell survival mechanisms (Owuor & Kong,
2002). It induces expression and upregulation of cytoprotective and
antioxidant genes that attenuate tissue injury. Shah et al. reported
that Nrf2 has an important role in protection against cerebral ischemic stroke (Shah et al., 2007). Nrf2 activation enhances defensive antioxidant mechanisms, within neurons and glia, in rat cortex
through upregulation of the antioxidant response and antioxidant
response element (ARE)-driven genes (Lee et al., 2003). AREregulated genes, such as HO-1, ferritin, and glutathione peroxidase,
maintain redox homeostasis. Of these, HO-1 has been reported to
have the most AREs on its promoter. Substantial evidence suggests
that HO-1 can be regulated through the Nrf2/ARE-mediated pathway (Satoh et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006). It has been shown that
HO-1 is expressed in the liver at 4 and 24 h after hind limb remote
preconditioning, which is associated with protection of the liver
against ischemia/reperfusion (Lai et al., 2006). Zhu et al. reported
that hypoxic preconditioning could increase the expression of
HO-1 protein in a retinal ischemic mouse model (Zhu et al., 2007).
More recently, Shokeir et al. reported that ischemic conditioning
could enhance expression of Nrf2 and its dependent antioxidant
genes, such as HO-1, in renal ischemia/reperfusion rat model
(Shokeir et al., 2013). However, in our pilot experiment, LRIConly treatment without ischemia had no significant effect on the
expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 within the retina at day 1 (data not
shown). Although the present study did not provide direct evidence
showing that Nrf-2 and HO-1 expression leads to neuroprotection,
this hypothesis has been supported by a recent study. He et al.
reported that the upregulated expressions of Nrf-2 and HO-1 by
ischemia/reperfusion were further enhanced by Lycium barbarum
polysaccharides, which protect retina from ischemia/reperfusion
injury (He et al., 2014). Integration of our results with previous

findings and literature suggests that LRIC exerts its beneficial
effect through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway.
In conclusion, we determined that limb remote ischemic conditioning (LRIC) protects the rat retina from ischemia/reperfusion
injury. Although the mechanism(s) involved in retinal ischemic conditioning need to be further examined, the results from our study and
the current literature support the idea that the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway
is directly involved in retinal protection induced by LRIC. The
results exhibited in this study may provide clues to help elucidate the
protective capabilities of LRIC. LRIC could serve as a valuable tool
in the scientific and medical community’s pursuit for superior therapeutics in enhancing neurological outcomes following ischemia/
reperfusion injury. The findings in our study indicate three directions
in which therapeutics could be designed. First, LRIC techniques
could be maximized and evaluated in depth to truly comprehend
and understand the power of this treatment. Second, pharmacologic
agents could be directed at the Nrf2 and HO-1 pathway. LRIC was
used to discover the potentiation of this pathway and its favorable
effects following ischemia and reperfusion. Moving forward, interventions could be developed that modulate and potentiate the Nrf2
and HO-1 pathway. Third, Nrf2 and HO-1 could be used as biomarkers of ischemic and reperfusion injury. Further studies would
be needed to differentiate and calibrate changes in Nrf2 and HO-1,
as they relate to clinical applicability and the patient.
