Abstract (S)-ZJM-289, a novel nitric oxide (NO)-releasing
derivative of 3-n-butylphthalide, induces the neuroprotection
in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R).
However, much is unknown about the late phase effect in the
neuroprotection of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning. The purpose of this study is to explore the late phase neuroprotection
of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning, as well as underlying
mechanisms involved. Preconditioning with 40–160 mg/kg,
(S)-ZJM-289 significantly reduces brain damage after I/R.
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning is effective when applied
1–3 days before I/R. Moreover, the degrees of neuroprotection offered by (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning and ischemic
preconditioning are virtually identical. (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning also protects primary cultured cortical neurons
against oxygen-glucose deprivation and recovery-induced
cytotoxicity in vitro. (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning significantly increases the generation of NO, but has no effect on the

nitric oxide synthase activities. Additionally, (S)-ZJM-289
preconditioning promotes the dissociation between nuclearfactor-E2-related factor (Nrf2) and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, and induces Nrf2 nuclear localization. The
neuroprotection of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning is blocked
by Nrf2-siRNA in vitro. (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
up-regulates antioxidant enzymes against nervous injury.
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning significantly activates extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) and inhibits c-Jun
N-terminal kinases signaling cascade. The neuroprotection is
abolished by the ERK inhibitor PD98059 in vitro. Subsequently, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning increases the levels of
anti-apoptotic protein B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and inhibited the translocation of Bcl-2 associated X to the mitochondria, thus attenuating the release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria and the activation of downstream caspase.
These results suggest that (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
exerts the late phase protection against nervous injury induced
by transient cerebral ischemia and oxygen-glucose
deprivation.

Introduction
Cerebral ischemia is the chief cause of handicap and one of
the most common cause of death worldwide following
cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and its incidence rises
with the increase of age (Margaill et al. 2005; Simerabet
et al. 2008). The therapeutic goal in treating cerebral
ischemia is to reduce the extent of brain injury and thus
minimize neurological impairment. Strategies to prevent
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury have become the
focus of extensive research.

17

Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) modulates a powerful
endogenous protection present in the brain and other
organs (Joo et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2009). This consists of a
single or a series of brief, non-lethal ischemic periods
which condition the tissue to resist against significant cell
death when subsequently challenged by a normally lethal
ischemia. Unlike the early phase, neuroprotection induced
by IPC, which lasts 2–3 h and protects against infarction
but not against stunning, the late phase neuroprotection
induced by IPC lasts 3–4 days and protects against both
infarction and stunning, suggesting that it may have greater
clinical relevance (Bolli 2000). However, although effective, IPC is unable in many clinical settings because of
safety concerns (Freiberger et al. 2006). Therefore, finding
a safer preconditioning stimulus that is both practical and
effective or a biological agent that is able to induce neuroprotection pharmacologically may be a reasonable choice
for treating cerebral I/R.
(S)-ZJM-289, a novel nitric oxide (NO)-releasing
derivative of 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) (Fig. 1a), requires
enzymatic hydrolysis or non-enzymatic pathway to durably
liberate low level of NO at a constant rate (Wang et al.
2011). Recent studies show that (S)-ZJM-289 induces the
neuroprotection in a rat model of focal cerebral I/R (Zhao
et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012). Moreover, ZJM-289 (its
enantiomers) preconditioning induces early phase neuroprotection against infarction by I/R (administration 1 h
before I/R) (Zhuang et al. 2010). However, much is still
unknown about the late phase effect in the neuroprotection
of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning.

Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO)
Rats were first anesthetized with chloral hydrate sodium
(300 mg/kg intraperitoneally). MCAO surgery was performed as described in our previous report (Zhao et al.
2012). Briefly, the common carotid artery (CCA), the
external carotid artery (ECA), and the internal carotid
artery (ICA) were isolated from connective tissues. A 4–0
mono-filament nylon suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech Co.,
Ltd., Beijing, China) with a rounded tip was inserted into
the ICA through the ECA stump and gently advanced to
occlude the CCA. After 2 h sustained ischemia, blood flow
was restored by the withdrawal of the intraluminal suture.
Sham-operated rats were performed with the same surgical
procedures except that the arteries were not occluded.
Ischemic Preconditioning
In the case of preconditioning, the suture was inserted as
described above for 10 min. The suture was then removed
completely and the wound was sutured. 72 h later, the
animals were re-anesthetized and suffered lethal MCAO
for 2 h.
(S)-ZJM-289 Preconditioning
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning experimental protocol was
illustrated in Supplemental Fig. 1. To evaluate the effects of
different concentrations (Supplemental Fig. 1a), rats were
randomly assigned to six groups consisting of MCAO group
(Group 1), (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning groups (20, 40, 80,
or 160 mg/kg (S)-ZJM-289, intragastrically administrated),
and the vehicle (normal saline, intragastrically administrated), respectively (Groups 2–6, performed 1 day before
MCAO). To detect therapeutic time windows for (S)-ZJM289 (Supplemental Fig. 1b), 80 mg/kg (S)-ZJM-289 or the
vehicle (normal saline) were performed at 1, 2, 3, or 4 days
before MCAO (Groups 7–11).
Neurobehavioral Evaluation
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, the evaluation of neurological deficits was tested for sensorimotor performance via
a five-point neurological severity scale before termination
(Shah et al. 2006). Briefly, neurological deficits were graded
by the following scale: 0, no deficit; 1, forelimb weakness; 2,
circling to affected side; 3, inability to bear weight on the
affected side; and 4, no spontaneous motor activity.
Infarct volume assessment
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats were anesthetized and
their brains were removed and cut into 2 mm coronal

sections, and then stained with 0.5 % TTC at 37 °C for
15 min. Brain slices were scanned individually. The TTCstained sections were photographed with a digital camera
and the infarct areas of each section were determined with
the analysis of pixel counting by a computer program of
IPP 6.0.

the loss of Nissl substance, cavitation around nucleus and
by the presence of pyknotic homogenous nuclei. Ischemic
core and penumbra of the cerebral cortex were photographed in each section.
TDT-Mediated dUTP-Biotin Nick End-Labeling
(TUNEL) Analysis

Water Content Assessment
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats were anesthetized and
their brains were removed. The brain samples were
weighed immediately after dissection (wet weight) and
then dried at 105 °C for 24 h. The percent of water content
was calculated with the formula: (wet weight - dry
weight)/wet weight 9 100 %.
Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) Staining
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats were anesthetized
with 2 % pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) and then perfused through the left ventricle with 200 ml of ice-cold
0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by
400 ml of 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS. The brains were
removed and immersed in the same fixative for 2 days. The
brains were embedded in paraffin and cut into sections
(7 lm thickness). Brain sections obtained 1.5 mm behind
the Bregma in the coronal plane were stained with HE
using standard methods (Lin et al. 1993). The normal
morphology and the presence and nature of ischemic
damage were verified by a neuropathologist who was
unaware of the experimental design or results of the TTC
assay.
Nissl Staining
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats were anesthetized
with 2 % pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) and then perfused through the left ventricle with 200 ml of ice-cold
0.1 M PBS followed by 400 ml of 4 % paraformaldehyde
in 0.1 M PBS. The brains were removed and immersed in
the same fixative for 2 days. After dehydration in the
graded ethanol and xylene, the brain sections were
embedded in paraffin. Paraffin Sects. 4 lm in thickness
were dewaxed and rehydrated according to standard protocols, and then stained in 1 % toluidine blue at 50 °C for
5 min. After rinsing with double distilled water, the sections were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and cleared in xylene, then mounted with permount
cover slip and observed under a light microscope. Cells
that contained Nissl substance in the cytoplasm, loose
chromatin and prominent nucleoli were considered to be
normal neurons, and damaged neurons were identified by

Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats were anesthetized
with 2 % pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg) and then perfused through the left ventricle with 200 ml of ice-cold
0.1 M PBS followed by 400 ml of 4 % paraformaldehyde
in 0.1 M PBS. The brains were removed and immersed in
the same fixative for 2 days. TUNEL assay, as determined
by DNA laddering using commercial kits, was performed
essentially as described previously with a little modification (Zhao et al. 2012). TUNEL positive (green fluorescent) cells/field were counted by fluorescence microscopy
from ten randomly selected fields in a single slide using 3
slides/group and were used to evaluate the degree of
apoptosis for each treatment.
Nitric oxide and Nitric oxide synthase activities assay
To measure NO levels and NOS activities affected by
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning, rats in were intragastrically
administrated with 20, 40, 80, and 160 mg/kg (S)-ZJM-289,
23 mg/kg NBP (equivalent on molar basis to (S)-ZJM-289),
29 mg/kg SNAP (equivalent on molar basis to (S)-ZJM289), or the vehicle (normal saline), respectively (Supplemental Fig. 1c). Three days after preconditioning, rats were
anesthetized and their brains were removed. NO production
was evaluated indirectly by measuring nitrite/nitrate (NOX),
the stable metabolites of NO. NOX content in brain was
measured using colorimetric total NO assay kit (Jiancheng
Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) as described previously (Wang et al. 2012). The NO content was expressed as
fold change based on comparison with the sham group.
NOS activities were determined as described previously
(Luo et al. 2005). Briefly, NOS activities in the brain were
measured spectrophotometrically using a commercially
available kit (Jiancheng Bioengineering Institue, Nanjing,
China) that is based on the oxidation of oxyhaemoglobin to
methaemoglobin by NO. iNOS (inducible nitric oxide
synthase) activity was measured by adding ethyleneglycolbis (beta-aminoethylether)-N, N0 -tetraacetic acid (EGTA)
at 3 mM to chelate free Ca2? from the reaction mixture.
cNOS (constitutive nitric oxide synthase) activity was
computed by subtracting the Ca2?-independent NOS
activity from the total NOS activities. Total NOS, iNOS,
and cNOS activities were expressed as fold change based
on comparison with the sham group.

Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
Measurement
Oxidant generation was evaluated in homogenate and cortical
neurons using fluorescence microsphere 20 ,70 -dichlorofluorescin (DCFH), as described previously (Bejma et al. 2000).
50 ll brain homogenate supernatant or 1 9 106 cortical
neurons were added in assay medium and incubated at 37 °C
for 15 min. This allowed DCFH-DA to be cleaved by intracellular esterase to derive free DCFH. The rate of oxidation
from DCFH to dichlorofluorescein (DCF) indicative of oxidant production was followed at the excitation wavelength of
488 nm and emission wavelength of 525 nm for 30 min using
a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrometer.
Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) Activity Assay
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats were sacrificed and
the brains were removed. The homogenates extracted from
the cortex of ischemic hemisphere of brain were measured.
SOD activity was measured based on the extent inhibition
of amino blue tetrazolium formazan formation in the
mixture of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, phenazine
methosulphate, and nitroblue tetrazolium (NADH-PMSNBT), as described previously (Kakkar et al. 1984). Assay
mixture contained 0.1 ml of brain homogenate supernatant,
1.2 ml of sodium pyrophosphate buffer (pH 8.3, 0.052 M),
0.1 ml of PMS (186 lM), 0.3 ml of NBT (300 lM), and
0.2 ml of NADH (750 lM). Reaction was started by
addition of NADH. After incubation at 30 °C for 90 s, the
reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 ml of glacial acetic
acid. Reaction mixture was stirred vigorously with 4.0 ml
of n-butanol. Color intensity of the chromogen in butanol
was measured spectrophotometrically at 560 nm. The SOD
activity was calculated according to the SOD standard
control and expressed as fold change based on comparison
with the sham group.
Glutathione Peroxidase (GSH-PX) Activity Assay
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats were sacrificed and
the brains were removed. The homogenates extracted from
the cortex of ischemic hemisphere of brain were measured.
Activities of GSH-PX were determined as representative
antioxidant enzyme by following the modified version of
the previous method (Flohe and Gunzler 1984). The reaction mixture was prepared by adding 600 ll of potassium
phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA), 100 ll
of 10 mM GSH (reduced form), 100 ll of 1.5 mM
NADPH, and 100 ll of brain homogenate supernatant. An
amount of 100 ll of brain homogenate supernatant was
added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 37 °C for

123

Neurotox Res (2014) 26:16–31

10 min. To this, 50 ll of 12 mM t-butyl hydroperoxide
was added. The change in the absorbance was measured at
340 nm for 1 min. One unit of activity is equal to millimole of NADPH oxidized/mg protein/min. The GSH-Px
activity was expressed as fold change based on comparison
with the sham group.
Heme Oxygenase-1(HO-1) Activity Assay
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats were sacrificed and
the brains were removed. The homogenates extracted from
the cortex of ischemic hemisphere of brain were measured.
HO-1 activity was assessed by the protocol described
previously with the following modifications (Yang et al.
1999). Aliquots of brain homogenate supernatant were
incubated with heme (20 lM), rat liver cytosol (1 mg/ml),
MgCl2 (1 mM), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(0.2 units), glucose 6-phosphate (2 mM), and NADPH
(0.8 mM) in 0.2 mL of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) in subdued lighting for 15 min at 37 °C. Negative
controls (blanks) were prepared as above only without
NADPH. The reaction was stopped by snap cooling in ice
(0 °C). The amount of bilirubin generated was estimated as
the difference in values detected at 463 nm and 520 nm on
a microplate reader. The HO-1 activity was expressed as
fold change based on the comparison with the sham group.

Lipid Peroxidation Level Measurement
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, rats were sacrificed and
the brains were removed. The homogenates extracted from
the cortex of ischemic hemisphere of brain were measured.
Lipid peroxidation, a major indicator of oxidative stress,
was determined by measuring of the malondialdehyde
(MDA) level in tissue homogenates. MDA was an end
product of lipid peroxidation and its level was determined
spectrophotometrically by use of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances method (Mihara and Uchiyama 1978) with
little modification. Briefly, 5 ll supernatant was mixed
with 25 ll 3.0 % sodium dodecylsulfate, 75 ll acetic acid
buffer (pH 3.5), 75 ll 0.8 % 2-thiobarbituric acid, and
20 ll deionized water, followed by heating in a water bath
at 95 °C for 1 h. After cooling, 250 ll n-butanol and
pyridine (15:1) was added and the mixture was centrifuged
at 1,4009g for 15 min. The organic phase was collected
and the fluorescence intensity was monitored with excitation at 515 nm and emission at 553 nm. A standard curve
was run simultaneously with each set of samples by using
1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane as an external standard. The
MDA content was expressed as fold change based on
comparison with the sham group.

Cortical Neurons Culture

siRNA Transfection

Primary cultured cortical neurons were isolated and cultured as described in our previous studies (Zhao et al.
2012). Briefly, whole cerebral cortices were dissected,
incubated for 15 min in 0.25 % trypsin at 37 °C, and
mechanically dissociated using Pasteur pipette. Cells were
collected by centrifugation and resuspended in DMEM/F12
(1:1) with 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 U/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded at a
density of 1.5 9 105 cells/cm2 onto poly-D-lysine-coated
96- or 6-well plates and were maintained in a humidified
incubator in air with 5 % CO2 (Thermo Scientific 3110,
OH, USA). After 24 h, the culture medium was changed to
neurobasal medium supplemented with 2 % B27 (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Medium replacement
was performed every 3 days. The neurons were maintained
for 7–10 days in primary cultures until used for the following experiments.

Cells were transfected with 50 nM Nrf2-annealed siRNA
(small interfering RNA; Genechem, Shanghai, China) by
electroporation with a high-efficiency electroporator (type
NEPA21, Nepa Gene Co. Ltd., Chiba, Japan) according
to the previous study (Aoyagi et al. 2012). The siRNA
sequences utilized targeted the following rat Nrf2 coding
sequences 50 -UGGAGCAAGACUUGGGCCACUUAAA-30
and 50 -UUUAAGUGGCCCAAGUCUUGCUCCA-3. Control experiments were performed using equivalent amounts of
the StealthTM RNAi Negative Control Med GC (Genechem,
Shanghai, China).

Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation and Recovery (OGD/R)
Treatment
Oxygen-glucose deprivation was used as an in vitro model
of cerebral ischemia and carried out as described previously (Liu et al. 2012). Neurons were rinsed twice and
incubated in Earle’s solution without glucose containing
(in mM) 116 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.8 MgSO4, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 1.8
CaCl2, and 26 NaHCO3 (pH 7.35). Then, the cultures were
introduced into a specialized, humidified chamber filled
with 95 % N2 and 5 % CO2 at 37 °C for 2 h (OGD). At the
end of this period, cultures were replaced with the normal
DMEM/F12 medium under normoxic conditions for 24 h
(recovery, R). (S)-ZJM-289 (0.1, 1 and 10 lM) was applied
to cortical cell cultures 24 h before and during OGD/R.
Controls were incubated with Earle’s solution containing
5.6 mM glucose and maintained in an incubator with 5 %
CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C.

Western Blot Analysis
Brain homogenate supernatant and cells lysed in lysis
buffer (30 mM Tris–Hcl (pH 7.5), 150 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 1 % Nonidet P-40, 10 % glycerol, and
phosphatase and protease inhibitors). Nuclear and mitochondria extracts were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Western blot analysis was performed
as described previously (Zhang et al. 2013). Briefly, the
proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride
membranes (Millipore Corporation, MA, USA). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (KEN GENE), and CLUBIO 2850 gel
catcher.

Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses
were made using one-way ANOVA, followed by a Tukey’s
multiple comparison test for multiple comparisons. A
p value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Cell Viability and Apoptosis Assessment
At 24 h post-OGD, neuronal cell viability was measured by
the MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity
in the medium was determined according to our previous
studies (Zhao et al. 2012).
For the detection of cell apoptosis, cells were stained
with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide at room
temperature for 15 min. Cells were then analyzed by flow
cytometry (488 nm excitation and 600 nm emission filters)
using BD FACSCalibur flowcytometer (Becton & Dickinson Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

(S)-ZJM-289 Preconditioning Inducing a Late Phase
Neuroprotection Against Cerebral Ischemia/
Reperfusion
The neuroprotective effect of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
depended on the concentrations of (S)-ZJM-289 and the time
intervals between the ischemia and the administration of
(S)-ZJM-289. Compared with MCAO group, exposing rats

123

22

Neurotox Res (2014) 26:16–31

to 40–160 mg/kg (S)-ZJM-289 1 day before I/R offered
protection against the brain damage by MCAO. In addition,
80 mg/kg (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning proved to be more
effective in reducing brain damage. However, 20 mg/kg
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning exerted no protective effect
(Fig. 1b). To determine the optimal ischemia-administration
interval, 80 mg/kg (S)-ZJM-289 was selected as the concentration of preconditioning. The maximal neuroprotection
was induced with 3 days interval between ischemia and the
administration of (S)-ZJM-289, and 1 day or 2 days interval
also led to statistically significant effect (Fig. 1c). Above all,
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning could induces a late phase
neuroprotection against I/R injury. 80 mg/kg (S)-ZJM-289
and 3 days interval between ischemia and the administration
were selected for the subsequent study.

IPC, followed 3 days later by 2 h MCAO, reperfused for
24 h and then subjected to brain damage evaluation. IPC
or (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning significantly reduced the
I/R-induced brain infraction by 31 % or 40 % (Fig. 2a).
The water content was remarkably increased in the MCAO
group (84.51 %) versus sham (78.93 %), representing a
severe I/R injury (Fig. 2b). IPC or (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning decreased the brain water content after I/R, with the
percent 82.23 % or 82.63 %, respectively. The result of

Neurotox Res (2014) 26:16–31

neurological scoring was presented in Fig. 2c. Sham group
had no neurological deficit throughout the observation
period. Neurological scores in the MCAO group worsened
obviously after I/R. Both IPC and (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning reduced these I/R-induced neurological deficits.
HE staining was performed to determine the neuroprotective effects of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning and IPC after
I/R. As shown in Fig. 2d, the normal neurons in the prefrontal cortex of the sham group were packed tightly and
orderly with clear nuclei. However, there were many
unhealthy neurons with the characteristic histopathological
features of I/R damage, nucleus shrinkage, cytoplasm with
increased eosinophilia, and cellular edema in the MCAO
group. Importantly, the histopathological abnormalities
were attenuated in S-ZJM-289 preconditioning and IPC
group. In parallel with the HE staining, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning or IPC significantly increased the intact neuron
in the cortex, compared with MCAO group (Nissl staining,
Fig. 2e). However, there was no significant difference
between the two groups. Together, these results suggested
that the degrees of neuroprotection offered by IPC and
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning were virtually identical.
(S)-ZJM-289 Preconditioning Reducing Apoptosis
Following Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion
To investigate the involvement of apoptosis in the delayed
death of cortical neurons after I/R, TUNEL staining was
carried out after I/R. As shown in Fig. 3a, TUNEL-positive
cells did not appear in the sham group, whereas a large
number of cells with green fluorescent (TUNEL-positive)
were detected in the MCAO group. (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning or IPC significantly reduced the number of
TUNEL-positive cells, indicating that (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning reduced I/R-induced apoptosis.
The proto-oncoproteins (Bcl-2 and Bax) are the powerful regulator of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
initiated by a variety of extracellular and intracellular
stresses (Yang et al. 1997). The I/R injury is accompanied
by the imbalance between pro-apoptotic Bax and antiapoptotic Bcl-2, the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria, the release of cytochrome c and the reduction in
the mitochondrial membrane potential in vitro (Qian et al.
2011). As shown in Fig. 3b–c, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning and IPC obviously increased the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. In
addition, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning and IPC significantly increased the expression of Bcl-2 in the mitochondria and inhibited the translocation of Bax to the
mitochondria. Consistently, the expression of cytochrome c
in the cytosolic fraction was significantly increased in the
MCAO group. (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning or IPC significantly attenuated the release of cytochrome c from
mitochondria to cytosolic (Fig. 3d–e). These observations

23

showed that (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning inhibited the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway after I/R.
Caspases are widely expressed in an inactive proenzyme
form in normal cells. Active/cleaved caspases can often
activate other pro-caspases, allowing initiation of a protease cascade in apoptotic cells (Cohen 1997). Caspase 9 and
caspase 3, the marker of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways,
were selected to evaluate the effect of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning on the caspase pathway. As shown in Fig. 3f–g,
caspase 9 and caspase 3 were activated in the MCAO group.
However, both (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning and IPC
effectively suppressed I/R-induced caspase activation as the
cleaved bands were further faded compared with the MCAO
group.
(S)-ZJM-289 Protects Primary Cultured Cortical
Neurons Against OGD/R-Induced Cytotoxicity
To examine the neuroprotective effects of (S)-ZJM-289
against OGD/R-induced cytotoxicity, various concentrations (0.1–10 lM) of (S)-ZJM-289 were added to the culture medium 24 h before OGD/R treatment. As shown in
Fig. 4a, the viability of the cells exposed to OGD/R was
reduced compared with the control. (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning significantly attenuated OGD/R-induced cell
death. Moreover, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning also abolished the increased LDH release caused by the OGD/R
treatment (Fig. 4b). The cytoprotective effects of (S)-ZJM289 were also confirmed by AV/PI staining (Fig. 4c). Cells
exposed to OGD/R showed significant damage with the
apoptotic rate of 45.7 %. (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning at
10 lM decreased the apoptosis rate to 18.3 %.
Effects of (S)-ZJM-289 Preconditioning on Nitric
Oxide Content and Nitric Oxide Synthase Activities
The association of the neuroprotective effect of (S)-ZJM-289
preconditioning with NO was investigated, by assessing
activity of two isoforms of NOS and measuring stable products of NO. As shown in Fig. 5a, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning significantly increased the generation of NO, as
compared with vehicle. However, NBP had no effect on NO
production. Moreover, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning did not
generate more NO compared with SNAP, a classical NO
donor with neuroprotective action (Um et al. 2011).
iNOS and cNOS activity were significantly increased in
SNAP group. Indeed, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
showed no statistical difference, similar to the effect of
NBP treatment, on iNOS and cNOS activity (Fig. 5b). It
could be due to the different mechanism between (S)-ZJM289 and SNAP. As shown in our results, (S)-ZJM-289
preconditioning increased the production of NO, but had no
effect on the NOS activities.

(S)-ZJM-289 Preconditioning Up-Regulating
Endogenous Antioxidant Systems Following Cerebral
Ischemia/Reperfusion
It is well established that, after cerebral I/R, the ROS production is dramatically increased and overwhelms endogenous antioxidant systems, leading to brain injury
(Madamanchi et al. 2005; Schreibelt et al. 2007). As shown
in Fig. 6a, a significant increase in the ROS production was
observed in the MCAO group after I/R. The elevated level of
ROS generation brought down notably following (S)-ZJM289 preconditioning. Moreover, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning protected primary cultured cortical neurons against
OGD/R-induced oxidative stress (Fig. 6b). Lipid peroxidation is the hallmark of ROS-induced brain injury. In this
study, MDA was used as a marker of lipid peroxidation. The
content of MDA was significantly increased in the MCAO
group after I/R. However, there were no significant differences in the content of MDA between the two preconditioning groups and the MCAO group (Fig. 6c).
Part of IPC induced protection stems from its ability to upregulate the cellular antioxidant defense system. Nuclearfactor-E2-related factor (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor

that regulates antioxidant genes as an adaptive response to
oxidative stress or pharmacological stimuli (Thompson et al.
2012). To investigate the effect of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning on the Nrf2 signaling, the cellular locations of Nrf2
and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap-1) were
elevated after I/R. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the
expression of Nrf2 in the nuclear fraction was significantly
higher in (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning and IPC groups than
in the MCAO group. On the contrary, Keap-1 expression in
the cytosolic fraction decreased in (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning and IPC groups compared with the MCAO group
(Fig. 6d–e). Moreover, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning also
reinforced the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus compared
with the OGD/R group in vitro (Fig. 6f–g). These results
demonstrated that (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning promoted
the dissociation between Nrf2 and Keap-1 and induced Nrf2
nuclear localization. In order to better clarify the mechanistic
link between (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning and the translocation of Nrf2, cells were transfected with Nrf2-siRNA.
Fig. 6h represented the effective down-regulation of Nrf2
obtained with siRNA in cultured cortical neurons. Moreover,
Nrf2 down regulation led to a marked decrease of cell viability elicited by (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning (Fig. 6i).

levels by Western blot. i Neurons were transfected with siNrf2 or Ctrl
siRNA for 24 h. The transfected cells were treated with (S)-ZJM-289
for 24 h before OGD/R treatment. Cell viability was measured by

The regulation of most of the antioxidant enzymes
occurs through the Nrf2 nuclear localization (Schulke et al.
2012). Such antioxidant enzymes as SOD, GSH-PX, and

HO-1, have a key role in the resistance of the neuronal cells
to ROS-induced cell death. To evaluate the effects of
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning on antioxidant enzymes, the

123

Neurotox Res (2014) 26:16–31

activities of SOD, GSH-PX, and HO-1 were measured after
I/R. In response to I/R injury, the activities of SOD and
GSH-PX in the MCAO groups were significantly lower.
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning significantly increased the
activities of SOD and GSH-PX (Fig 7a, b). Similarly, the
activity of GSH-PX was also obviously up-regulated by
IPC treatment. Of note, the HO-1 activity was weakly
decreased in the MCAO group after I/R, while (S)-ZJM289 preconditioning significantly increased by 42 % of the
MCAO group (Fig. 7c). However, IPC failed to affect the
activity of HO-1. Moreover, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
significantly increased the expression of HO-1 (Fig. 7d–e),
which was consistent with the result of HO-1 activity. The
increase of HO-1 expression was also observed in the IPC
group, disagreeing with the result of HO-1 activity (Fig. 7c).
Above all, these observations indicated that (S)-ZJM-289
preconditioning activated Nrf2 and up-regulated antioxidant
enzymes against I/R-induced nervous injury.
(S)-ZJM-289 Preconditioning Regulating MitogenActivated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Signaling Pathway
Following Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion
The previous studies reported that MAPK signaling
pathways were related to cell apoptosis (Nishina et al.
2004; Xia et al. 1995). In order to better clarify the

neuroprotective mechanism of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning, the activation of three fundamental protein
kinases: extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK),
p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) were evaluated
after I/R. The expressions of p-p38 and p-JNK were
significantly increased in MCAO group, while (S)-ZJM289 preconditioning and IPC markedly decreased the
expression of p-JNK, whereas the expression of p-p38
was not influenced by (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning or
IPC (Fig. 8a, b). In addition, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
upgraded the expression of p-ERK. These results indicated that (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning regulated the
expressions of ERK and JNK to cope with the nervous
injury following I/R. We next examined whether ERK
pathway participated in the neuroprotective effect of
(S)-ZJM-289 in vitro. Consequently, cortical neurons
exposed to OGD/R showed a decrease in the expression
of phospho-ERK, in agreement with the previous report
(Liu et al. 2012). However, (S)-ZJM-289 treatment augmented the reduced phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 8c, d).
No differences were detected in the total ERK. Moreover,
specific inhibitor (PD98059) for ERK activation partially
reduced the neuroprotection elicited by (S)-ZJM-289
(Fig. 8e). These results indicated the involvement of
activation of ERK signaling pathways in neuroprotective
effect of (S)-ZJM-289.

Discussion

neuroprotection. The time required for the development of
the ischemic tolerance strongly suggests that the protection is
mediated by the activation of genes encoding for cytoprotective proteins of which up-regulation is activated by trigger
mechanisms occurring after IPC. Based on this paradigm, the
therapeutic time window of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
was assessed. Our study showed that administration of
(S)-ZJM-289 performed 3 days before MCAO induced
neuroprotection, while neuroprotection was insignificant if
the intervention was delayed for 4 days (Fig. 1c). Our study
demonstrated that (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning exerted the
late phase neuroprotection against I/R-induced neuronal
injury as manifested by the reduction of brain infarction
(Fig. 2a), decreased in the water content (Fig. 2b) and
reducing neurological deficit (Fig. 2c). HE staining (Fig. 2d)

The algorithm of preconditioning (i.e., interval between
ischemia and the administration, the concentration) influences the effectiveness of neuroprotection, hence dose–
response and therapeutic time windows studies were
designed. Our results showed that 40–160 mg/kg (S)-ZJM289 preconditioning significantly reduced brain damage
after MCAO, while 20 mg/kg (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
did not exert neuroprotection (Fig. 1b). This phenomenon
could be attributed to the low concentration (20 mg/kg) of
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning made it insensitive to alter
protein expression responsible for neuroprotection against
I/R. To date, Puisieux et al. (2004) report IPC performed
3 days before focal cerebral ischemia can induce

123

Neurotox Res (2014) 26:16–31

and Nissl staining (Fig. 2e) also confirmed that both
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning and IPC rescued neuronal loss
after ischemia. Taken together, the degree of neuroprotection induced by (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning was equivalent to that of IPC in the same I/R model. In addition,
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning reversed the OGD/R-induced
cultured neurons injury in vitro (Fig. 4a, b).
NO is a free radical gaseous molecule,which regulates
several physiologic processes. NO may react with other
oxygen species such as O
2 and hydrogen peroxide to
generate radical nitrogen species, such as peroxynitrite
(ONOO-). NO can directly regulates certain proteins
through S-nitrosylation. NO may plays several separate
roles in IPC (Huang 2004). Zhuang et al. (2010) report that
ZJM-289 appears to have NO release in vitro. In the
present study, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning notably
increased the NO content in the rat brain (Fig. 5a). Two
isoforms of NOS, named cNOS and iNOS, are involved in
the mechanisms of IPC (Kapinya et al. 2000; Atochin et al.
2003). However, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning had no effect
on the iNOS activity and cNOS activity (Fig. 5b). Moreover,
the neuroprotective effect of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
was stronger than that of NBP or SNAP treatment (data not
shown in the text). The ability of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning to protect against cerebral I/R was not simply related
to NO generation. This phenomenon can be attributed to the
multiple mechanism of (S)-ZJM-289, which integrates the
function of NBP and NO-donor.
Part of IPC induced protection stems from its ability to upregulate the cellular antioxidant defense system. The regulation of most of these antioxidant enzymes occurs through
the activation of Nrf2 (Fisher et al. 2007). The previous
studies show that Nrf2 translocates from the cytosolic to the
nucleus and bands to the antioxidant responsive element
(ARE) (Nguyen et al. 2005), a cis-acting regulatory element
or enhancer sequence, found in the promoter region of certain genes, include glutathione synthase, HO-1, and catalase
(Schulke et al. 2012). The coordinated action of Nrf2
mediates the response to oxidative stress (Jaiswal 2004).
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning combated against oxidative
stress as evidenced by the suppression of ROS and MDA
(Fig. 6a–c). This was the first study to report that (S)-ZJM289 preconditioning significantly induced the translocation
of Nrf2 to the nucleus (Fig. 6d–g) and marked increased the
cellular antioxidant defense system (Fig. 7a–e). Under normal conditions, the Nrf2 inhibitor Keap-1 bands and retains
Nrf2 in the cytoplasm where it can be targeted for ubiquitinmediated degradation (Cullinan et al. 2004). However, under
certain conditions, Keap1 or Nrf2 may be chemically modified through phosphorylation (Motohashi and Yamamoto
2004), deacetylation (Tkachev et al. 2011), and S-nitrosylation (Um et al. 2011). These chemical modifications

29

enhance Nrf2 disassociation from Keap-1, thus facilitating
Nrf2 nuclear translocation and subsequent Nrf2-dependent
gene expression. In the present study, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning decreased the expression of Keap-1 in the cytosolic
fraction (Fig. 6d, e). This result demonstrated that the
induction of Nrf2 translocation by (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning might through inhibiting the ubiquitin ligase activity
of Keap-1 or promoting the dissociation between Nrf2 and
Keap-1. In order to clarify the involvement of Nrf2 in
(S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning mediated neuroprotection, we
silenced Nrf2 gene expression by siRNA (Fig. 6h). Data
obtained confirmed that Nrf2 played a fundamental role in
neuroprotection induced by (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
(Fig. 6i). The major finding of the current study supported
the notion of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning inducing a signaling mechanism to combat oxidative stress, as evidenced
by the ability of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning to increase
cellular antioxidants and substantial reduction of intracellular ROS production via Keap1-Nrf2 signaling cascade.
In addition, NO is reported to activate MAPK signaling
pathway (Um et al. 2011). The current study was the first
reports that (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning regulated MAPK
in vivo (Fig. 8a, b). The activation of ERK signaling cascade
has previously been shown to confer neuroprotection
through an inhibition of apoptotic cell death (Anderson
1997), and plays a prominent role in the neuroprotective
signaling of IPC (Gonzalez-Zulueta et al. 2000). The neuroprotective actions of this pathway are mediated in part by
the up-regulation of the pro-survival factors Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL (Griner and Kazanietz 2007). Indeed, (S)-ZJM-289
preconditioning significantly increased the expression of
phospho-ERK both in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 8a–d). Moreover, specific inhibitor for ERK activation partially reduced
the neuroprotection elicited by (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning (Fig. 8e). These results indicated the involvement of the
activation of ERK signaling pathways in neuroprotective
effect of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning. JNK is activated by
many stress stimuli and plays a key role in I/R induced brain
injury. Targeted gene disruption studies have established
that JNK is required for the stress-induced release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and apoptosis. Moreover, Bax is
essential for JNK-dependent apoptosis. JNK promotes Bax
translocation to mitochondria through phosphorylation of
14-3-3, a cytoplasmic anchor of Bax (Tsuruta et al. 2004).
In the present study, we observed that (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning markedly inhibited JNK signaling cascade
(Fig 8a, b). Subsequently, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
increased the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and
inhibited the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria
(Fig. 3b, c), thus attenuating the release of cytochrome c
from the mitochondria (Fig. 3d, e) and the activation of
downstream caspase (Fig. 3f, g), thus inhibited apoptosis

123

30

(Figs. 3a, 4c). These results implied that regulating the
expression of ERK and JNK contributed to the (S)-ZJM-289
preconditioning-induced neuroprotection.
The activation of multiple pathways by (S)-ZJM-289
preconditioning in the current study highlights the diversity
of this novel compound. Unlike other pharmacological
agents that rely on receptor-mediated signaling, (S)-ZJM289 activates multiple pathways simultaneously. An
important question that remains unanswered relates to the
mechanism by which (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning induces
the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Whether (S)-ZJM-289
preconditioning alters Keap1 and/or Nrf2 directly or through
upstream signaling (i.e. MAPK) requires further study.
Conclusions
In summary, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning induced a late
phase neuroprotection against cerebral I/R. The degrees of
neuroprotection offered by (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning
and IPC were virtually identical. Also, (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning protected cultured cortical neurons from
OGD/R induced injury. The translocation of Nrf2 to the
nuclear, accompanied with the up-regulation of endogenous antioxidant systems, was partly responsible for the
neuroprotective effect of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning. In
addition, the protective effects of (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning might correlate with the modulation of ERK and
JNK phosphorylation. Above all, the findings suggested
that (S)-ZJM-289 preconditioning had the potential of
therapeutic benefit in the setting of cerebral I/R.
