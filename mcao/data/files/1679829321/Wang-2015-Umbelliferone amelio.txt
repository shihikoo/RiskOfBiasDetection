Umbelliferone (UMB), a natural antioxidant belonging to coumarin derivatives, is able to cross the bloodbrain barrier and protect neuronal cells from death. Here we aimed to investigate the effects of UMB in a
rat model of focal cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R).
Pretreatment with UMB (15 and 30 mg/kg) for 7 consecutive days ameliorated the neurological outcomes, infarct volume and brain edema in brains of MCAO rats. Our results provided evidence that
UMB signiﬁcantly protected neuronal cells against cerebral ischemia reperfusion-induced injury. Furthermore, UMB treatment could inhibited the level of oxidative stress and the production of inﬂammatory
cytokines in brain tissues of MCAO rats. In addition, UMB signiﬁcantly upregulated the expression of
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-␥ (PPAR-␥), which exhibited neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative disease. UMB treatment also suppressed NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation via reducing
expression of Thiredoxin-interactive protein (TXNIP). These results suggest that UMB may have beneﬁcial
effects for neuroprotection against focal cerebral ischemic partly through the inhibition of TXNIP/NLRP3
inﬂammasome and activation of PPAR-␥.

1. Introduction:
Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of brain injury which is
characterized as high incidence, high morbidity and high mortality [1]. Ischemic stroke can induce many damaging effects, such as
disruption of blood-brain barrier, brain edema, which cause brain
injury [2]. Prevention of ischemia/reperfusion injury is becoming
an important issue in Ischemic stroke treatment. The mechanism
of ischemic injury is complex, the currently acknowledged theories include excitotoxicity, cailcium overload, and oxidative stress,
inﬂammation, eventually leading to apoptosis or necrosis [3].

The brain is an organ predisposed to oxidative stress. Reactive
oxygen species (ROS) working in concert with an inﬂammatory process, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of Ischemic
stroke. Although oxidative stress, inﬂammation and apoptosis
occur together in Ischemic stroke, oxidative stress seems to be
a potential initiation [4]. Recently it is shown that thioredoxininteracting protein (TXNIP) activation is a key event linking
oxidative stress to inﬂammation and apoptosis in neurons [5]. In
response to ROS released from mitochondria, TXNIP dissociates
from the complex and rapidly binds to NLRP3 (Nod-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3) inﬂammasome. TXNIP then
induces inﬂammasomes activation, which results in maturation
and secretion of IL-1␤ and IL-18 [6]. The mature IL-1␤ and IL-18
are needed for the processing of inﬂammation and apoptosis [7].

scavenging properties [8]. UMB has been reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects in MPTP-induced mouse model and cross
the blood-brain barrier, indicating that UMB has the potential to
protect neuron from apoptosis [9]. UMB positively regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-␥ (PPAR-␥) activity and
this action is involved in amelioration of metabolic disorders
and alcohol-induced fatty liver [10–12]. PPAR-␥, belonging to the
nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, has been certiﬁed as an
important regulator of apoptosis, oxidative stress and inﬂammation [13–15], and also plays a signiﬁcant role in the neuroprotection
against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury [16]. However, few
studies have discussed the neuroprotective effects of UMB in
Ischemic stroke. The present study is aimed to elucidate the mechanism through which UMB ameliorated ischemia/reperfusion injury
by inhibition of inﬂammasome activation.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Umbelliferone (purity ≥ 98%) (Nanjing Zelang Medical Technology Co., Ltd., China), 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
(Amresco, USA), SOD and MDA assay kits (Nanjing Jiancheng
Bioengineering Institute, China), IL-1␤ and IL-18 ELISA kits (Shenzhen Dakewe Biotech Co., Ltd., China), Bicinchoninic acid (BCA)
kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai,
China). Antibodies used in Western blot analysis: anti-caspase-1
(ab108362) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, USA);
anti-NLRP3 (NBP2-12446) and anti-TXNIP (NBP1-54578) were purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO, USA); anti-PPAR␥
(sc-271392), anti-␤-actin (sc-130656) and anti-rabbit IgG (HRP)
(sc-45101) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
2.2. Experiment animals
Male rats of Sprague–Dawley with body weight ranging from
220 to 270 g were procured from Comparative Medicine Center,
Yangzhou University (Yangzhou, China) and maintained under
standard conditions (temperature: 25 ± 1 ◦ C, air humidity: 60–65%)
with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Water and standard chow were
provided ad libitum during the whole experiment procedure. All
experimental procedures were carried out strictly in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (Publication No. 85-23, revised 1985).
2.3. Surgeries and drug administration
Rats were randomly divided into sham, MCAO, UMB-treated
groups. UMB (15 and 30 mg/kg) vehicle was administered by
intraperitoneal injection for 7 days before MCAO. 10% dimethyl
sulph oxide was used as a vehicle solution for the intraperitonial
administration of Umbelliferone [17,18]. Rats were anesthetized
with intraperitoneal injection of chloral hydrate (350 mg/kg). With
the right common carotid artery (CCA) exposed by a short incision, the internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery
(ECA) were separated out. With ECA being ligated, CCA and ICA
being clamped by bulldog clamp, a 3-0 monoﬁlament nylon suture
with the tip rounded was inserted from the CCA into the ICA up
to 18–20 mm. Body temperatures were maintained at 37 ± 0.5 ◦ C
by a heating equipment. Rats were subjected to 2 h occlusion, and
22 h reperfusion. Neurologic deﬁcit, brain water content (BWC),
infarct volume and biochemical analysis were evaluated after 22 h
of reperfusion.

2.4. Neurologic deﬁcit evaluation
A blinded investigator evaluated sensorimotor scores after 22 h
of reperfusion. The neurological functions were scored referring to
the Zea-Longa neurological deﬁcit score [19], which was a 5-point
scale as follows: score 0, no neurologic deﬁcit; score 1, failure to
extend forepaw fully; score 2, failure to walk straight and circling
to one side; score 3, falling to one side; score 4, no spontaneous
motor activity.
2.5. Infarct volume measurement
After 22 h of reperfusion, animals were killed by decapitation
and the brain was stored immediately at −20 ◦ C for 30 min. Frozen
brain was cut into ﬁve coronal sections. The brain slices were put
into 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution at 37 ◦ C
for 30 min, under the conditions of protection from light. The measured slices were photographed, and the area of ischemic brain
injury was calculated by a blinded observer with Image J software,
expressed as infarct area percentage (%).
2.6. Brain water content(BWC)
After 22 h of reperfusion, after animals were decapitated and
the brain was removed immediately, the wet brain weight (WW)
was weighed with an electronic balance and placed in 120 ◦ C
dry oven, with dry weight (DW) to be obtained after 24 h. BWC
(%) = (WW − DW)/WW × 100%.
2.7. Nissl staining
After anesthetization with intraperitoneal injection of chloral
hydrate (350 mg/kg), rats were perfused through the left ventricle with 100 ml cold saline (0.9%), followed by 100 ml cold
paraformaldehyde (4%). Brains were removed quickly, ﬁxated with
10% formalin at room temperature, and sectioned into coronal slices
with a cryostat microtome at −20 ◦ C. The sections were stained
with tolridine blue and examined with microscope. To observe neuronal survival in the CA1 region, neurons with round and palely
stained nuclei were considered as surviving cells, which were indicated by arrows in the picture. Data were expressed as the number
of surviving cells/ﬁeld.
2.8. Determination of superoxide dismutase (SOD),
malondialdehyde (MDA) in brain tissues
Rat hippocampus was separated out and homogenized with normal saline (w:v 1:9) on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at
2500–3000 rpm for 10 min, and 10% supernatant was collected with
an ﬂnnpipette. Protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by BCA kit. SOD activities and MDA content were measured
according to the instructions of test kits.
2.9. Measurement of IL-1ˇ and IL-18 production
The levels of IL-1␤ and IL-18 in hippocampus were determined
by ELISA assays, according to the instructions from the manufacturer and quantiﬁed with a microplate reader at 450 nm. The data
were shown as picogram per milliliter (pg/ml).
2.10. Western blot analysis
Rat hippocampus was separated out and homogenized with icecold lysis buffer containing protein inhibitor. The homogenate was
centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 ◦ C. Protein concentration

of the supernatant was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit on the basis of the manufacturer’s instructions. The
western blot procedure was performed as previously described
[18]. The corresponding quantiﬁcations represents values were
obtained as a ratio of the target to control.
2.11. Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed by the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.
Results presented in the paper were shown as the mean ± SEM and
implemented by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed
by Tukey’s test for inter-group comparisons. Value of p ≤ 0.05 was
regarded to be signiﬁcantly different.
3. Result
3.1. Effects of UMB on the neurological defect scores and brain
water content in rats
As shown in Fig. 1A, there were no neurological deﬁcit in Sham
group, and the neurological function scores of MCAO group were
signiﬁcantly higher than Sham group. Compared with the model,
the scores in groups pretreated with UMB (15 and 30 mg/kg)
showed a signiﬁcantly decreasing trend [F(3,36) = 33.86, p < 0.01].
The BWC is measured after 22 h of reperfusion with data presented in Fig. 1B. The BWC was signiﬁcantly increased in MCAO
group compared with the sham and signiﬁcantly decreased in UMBpretreated (15 and 30 mg/kg) rats [F(3,8) = 4.55, p < 0.05].

tion appeared, but infarct volume in UMB groups were signiﬁcantly
reduced compared with MCAO group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).
3.3. Nissl staining
Nissl staining was carried out in hippocampus CA1 region. The
data revealed that the number of positive cells in MCAO group was
signiﬁcantly reduced (Fig. 2) [F(3,8) = 17.29, p < 0.01]. The number
of surviving cells was signiﬁcantly reversed by the pretreatment
with UMB (15 and 30 mg/kg). The arrow represented the surviving
neuronal cells.
3.4. Effects on SOD and MDA
SOD activities (Fig. 3A) were signiﬁcantly reduced in MCAO
group [F(3,8) = 28.27, p < 0.01]. Conversely, MDA levels (Fig. 3B)
were signiﬁcantly elevated[F(3,16) = 30.68, p < 0.01]. Pretreatment
with UMB could increase SOD activities, but reduce MDA levels in
brain tissues.
3.5. Effects on IL1ˇ and IL-18
Protein levels (Fig. 4A,B) of interleukins-1␤ (IL1␤), and
interleukins-18 (IL-18) were signiﬁcantly elevated in MCAO group;
pretreatment with UMB (15 and 30 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly attenuated
the production of these cytokines [IL1␤: F(3,8) = 16.38, p < 0.01; IL18: F(3,8) = 14.53, p < 0.01].

sion (Fig. 4C,D). These results indicated that UMB suppressed NLRP3
inﬂammasome activation and inﬂammatory response.
3.7. UMB inhibited TXNIP induction
After cerebral ischemia–reperfusion, TXNIP was signiﬁcantly
increased in rat brain tissue (Fig. 5); pretreatment with UMB
reduced TXNIP expression, indicating the inhibitory role of UMB
on TXNIP activation.

found that UMB pretreatment improved neurological outcomes,
reduced infarct volume and brain edema.
The mechanism of the neuroprotective effects of UMB in the
brain tissue of rats after MCAO was discussed. Our results showed
that UMB treatment alleviated brain injury through the inhibition
of the level of IL-1␤ and IL-18 in brain tissues, which resulted in
protection from neuronal damage, as indicated by an increase in
nissl-stained positive cells in the brain. Furthermore, our data indicate that UMB inhibited the inﬂammatory cytokines production
through the inhibition of TXNIP/NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation.
In addition, UMB treatment signiﬁcantly upregulated the expression of PPAR-␥. These results demonstrated that the UMB has
beneﬁcial effects in ischemic reperfusion-induced brain injury, at
least in part, through the upregulate the expression of PPAR-␥ and
inhibition of TXNIP/NLRP3 inﬂammasome.
The brain is prone to the damage induced by oxidative stress.
Previous studies showed that oxidative stress caused by overproduction of ROS plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Ischemic
stroke [20,21]. MCAO results in the reduced levels of the antioxidant system including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and increased
level of lipid peroxidation such as MDA, subsequently leading to
the damage of cellular membrane, protein and DNA and ultimately
inducing neuronal death. In our study, UMB could increase SOD
activities and reduced MDA levels in brain tissues of MCAO rats,
which is consistent with the previous studies.
More and more studies have demonstrated that inﬂammation
is an important contributor to the pathophysiology of vascular diseases, especially stroke [22]. Recent studies have highlighted the
role of NLRP3 inﬂammasome, a member of NLR family, which activated caspase-1 and served as a platform for maturation of IL-1␤
and IL-18. The NLRP3 inﬂammasome is one of the most recently
identiﬁed protein complex implicated in the development of brain
injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion [23]. Moreover, recent
studies showed that oxidative stress-induced cell death is regulated
by inﬂammsome activation, for which TXNIP is required. TXNIP is
the endogenous inhibitor and regulator of thioredoxin, which could
rapidly bind to NLRP3 inﬂammasome, triggering assembly and
oligomerization of the inﬂammasome. In addition, TXNIP expression is upregulated in brain tissue of MCAO rats. In the present
study, we found that UMB treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited oxidative stress and suppressed inﬂammasome activation by blocking
TXNIP, resulting in inhibition of inﬂammatory cytokines secretion
and the inﬂammation response.
PPAR-␥ was constitutively expressed in the brain [24], which
had been regarded as a signiﬁcant pharmacological target for
central nervous system (CNS) disease [25]. PPAR␥ agonist could
alleviate the harmful effects of oxidative stress and inﬂammation
during brain ischemia, indicating the neuroprotective role of PPAR␥ in ischemic stroke [26]. In addition, a recent paper has found
PPAR-␥ binding sites in the promoter regions of a member of
the NLRP family, indicating the correlation between PPAR-␥ and
NLRP family of protein [27]. In agreement with these studies, we
found that UMB upregulated the expression of PPAR-␥ and signiﬁcantly alleviated oxidative stress and inﬂammation in MCAO
rats.

3.8. UMB increased the level of PPAR- in MCAO rats
The expression of PPAR-␥ was measured by Western blot.
PPAR-␥ was seldom expressed in Sham animals, and was almost
invariably in MCAO (Fig. 6). Pretreatment with UMB greatly upregulated the expression of PPAR-␥.
4. Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the effects of pretreatment with UMB
in a rat model of cerebral ischemic-reperfusion for the ﬁrst time and

5. Conclusions
Our results provide evidence that the chronic exposure to MCAO
induced cerebral damage through oxidative stress and inﬂammatory response. Pretreatment with UMB exhibited neuroprotective
effects in ischemia/reperfusion-induced brain injury. This effect of
UMB may be partly related with inhibition of NLRP3 inﬂammasome
in the brain and upregulation of PPAR-␥ expression, suggesting the
prevention effect of UMB for the Ischemic stroke.
