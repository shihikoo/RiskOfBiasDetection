Abstract Pre-clinical models of stroke therapeutics depend
upon the ability to detect differences in infarct volume as well
as in the short- and long-term outcomes of treated animals.
Little attention has been paid to interstrain differences in these
outcomes and the importance of defining the most appropriate
behavioral tests. In this study, we evaluate long-term outcome
from stroke in three different rat strains. Lewis, Wistar, and
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to 2-h middle
cerebral artery occlusion and survived for up to 49 days.
Behavioral tests were performed weekly. There was continuous assessment of rotational/circling activity in the home cage
by use of an automated software program. A separate group of
animals was sacrificed at 24 h to determine infarct volume.
Infarct volume was similar in all three strains. Mortality was
significantly higher in SD rats (P<0.001). Rotational/circling
activity at 24 h was correlated with cortical infarct volume in
Wistar and SD rats (ρ=0.67, P=0.04 and ρ=0.72, P=0.01,
respectively). Wistar and SD rats displayed more rotational/
circling activity following stroke than Lewis rats, but Lewis
rats evidenced more impairment on complex motor tasks like
the rotarod. Further, computer automated analysis of rotational activity was more sensitive than subjective assessment, with
SD rats showing a preference for clockwise rotations to
49 days after stroke despite normalization of the neurological
score after 21 days. There are significant interstrain differences in survival and in the patterns of neurological impairment and recovery after stroke. These differences must be
taken into account in pre-clinical studies, but may also be

Introduction
There is growing emphasis on the need to evaluate long-term
outcomes in pre-clinical models of stroke. The widely used
Bederson neurological score was developed in Sprague–
Dawley (SD) rats and used to evaluate outcome at 24 h after
experimental stroke [1]. The Bederson neurological score is
weighted heavily on the fact that the SD rats tend to rotate/
circle following middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarction. In the Bederson study, craniectomy was performed, the
MCA surgically occluded at different sites and behavior correlated to infarct volume. Subsequent publications described
occlusion (and reperfusion) of the MCA without craniectomy,
thus providing a less traumatic model of focal cerebral ischemia and facilitating studies of long-term outcome. The original report of MCA occlusion (MCAO) with an intraluminal
suture by Longa and colleagues was also done using SD rats
and assessment of outcome again focused on rotational/
circling behavior [2].
Infarct volume is variable among rats of different strains
subjected to similar degrees of ischemia using an intraluminal
filament [3–7]. Further, short-term differences are seen in the
neurological score/motor deficits of these different strains [5].
There is little published on interstrain differences in long-term
behavioral outcomes. It has been noted, however, that deficits
on behavioral tests months after stroke do not necessarily
correlate with the extent of infarction, and where data do exist,

570

it suggests that behavioral deficits differ between strains despite similar degrees of infarction [8–10]. In this study, we
sought to better understand interstrain differences in long-term
behavioral outcomes as assessed by an array of behavioral
tests. We also utilized an automated system to determine if
subtle differences in the preference for clockwise (CW) and
counter-clockwise (CCW) turns after MCAO are apparent
among three rat different strains.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Lewis rats were purchased from Taconic Farms; Wistar and
SD rats were purchased from Charles River Labs. Animals
weighed between 325 and 375 g at baseline. All experiments
were approved by the University of Washington Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion
Anesthesia was induced with 5 % and maintained with 1 %
isoflurane. After midline neck incision, the right common
carotid, external carotid, and pterygopalatine arteries were
ligated. A monofilament suture (4.0) was inserted into the
common carotid artery and advanced into the internal carotid
artery to occlude the origin of the middle cerebral artery.
Animals were maintained at normothermia during surgery
and reperfused 2 h after MCAO. Rectal temperature was
assessed at 2, 3, and 6 h, as well as each day for the first week
following MCAO and then weekly for the remainder of the
study period for each group. Body weight was assessed daily
for the week after MCAO and weekly thereafter.
Infarct Volume
A subset of animals was sacrificed at 24 h. Brains were
removed, stored at −20 °C for 30 min, sectioned at 2-mm
intervals and then incubated in 2 % 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium
chloride (TTC) (Sigma) at 38 °C for 15 min. Brain sections
were scanned and digitized. Total infarct volume, cortical

infarct volume, and striatal infarct volume were determined
using ImageJ software [11].
Behavioral Outcomes
The neurological score was determined at multiple time points
after MCAO using a modification of the Bederson scale [1].
Our protocol for scoring is as follows: 0=no deficit, 0.5=
moderate forepaw tuck, 1=pronounced forepaw tuck, 1.5=
moderate resistance to lateral push, 2=inability to resist lateral
push, 2.5=turns predominately in one direction/turns in wide
circles, 3=turns persistently in small radius circles, 3.5=turns
persistently in small radius circles and intermittently stumbles,
4=turns persistently in small radius circles and leans/falls to
one side, 4.5=moves only intermittently/lethargic, 5=no
movement. Animals were trained on the rotarod for five
sessions over 5 days prior to MCAO. The rod accelerates to
5 rpm over the course of 3 s and then decelerates to a stop over
5 s. Each testing session consists of three trials which are 100 s
each. After MCAO, rotarod performance was assessed weekly. Performance on the foot fault test was also assessed at these
time points and the results expressed as a percentage of foot
faults per total number of steps taken over 3 min [12]. The
time to react to a piece of adhesive tape affixed to the affected
forepaw was also assessed before MCAO and weekly thereafter; trials were stopped at 300 s (5 min).
Home Cage System
To model the spontaneous/voluntary activity of the rats, the
Noldus Ethovision® home cage system was used. This system
utilizes an infrared light source and infrared camera installed
in the top of each custom Plexiglas home cage, allowing for
continuous remote monitoring of each rat regardless of ambient light conditions. Video was saved automatically into a
computer for analysis. The number of clockwise and
counter-clockwise turns was recorded daily and parsed into
dark versus light cycle (12-h dark/12-light; 0600:1800 hours)
activity. Data represent the median number of turns per hour;
only dark cycle activity is included in these analyses. For ease
of analysis, data were grouped into 7-day “epochs”, and the
median value for each epoch used for statistical analyses.

Rats were acclimated to the home cage system for at
least 5 days prior to MCAO. Animals were removed
from home cages for MCAO and placed back in the
home cages 1 day later for continuous monitoring during
the remainder of the experimental period (with the exception of weekly behavioral testing).

Statistics
Parametric data are presented as the mean±standard deviation; non-parametric data are presented as the median (interquartile range). Correlations are by Spearman’s rho (ρ). Mortality among strains was assessed using the log-rank test.
Group comparisons are performed with parametric or nonparametric tests as appropriate. Changes over time in each
strain are assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For
ease of behavioral data presentation, “heat maps” were created

In the subset of animals sacrificed at 24 h, infarct volume was
similar in all three strains (Table 1). Of note, however, is the
fact that striatal infarct volumes tended to be larger in
Lewis rats. Cortical infarct volume, but not striatal or
total infarct volume, correlated with the modified
Bederson neurological score at 24 h in Wistar (ρ=0.67,
P=0.04) and SD (ρ=0.72, P=0.01), but not Lewis, rats.
Mortality was significantly higher among SD rats with 23/
39 (59 %) of animals dying by day 28 compared to 1/13 (8 %)
Lewis rats and 1/10 (10 %) Wistar rats (P<0.001). The survival curve is shown in Fig. 1. (This graphic also provides the
number of animals in each strain providing outcome data at
each time point. Sample size calculations suggested we needed 10–12 animals per strain to detect behavioral differences;
the large number of SD rats operated on was to insure survival
of sufficient numbers of this strain.) For the cohort of animals
that survived, long-term physiologic changes after MCAO are
depicted in Fig. 2. Late after stroke, rectal temperatures were
higher in Wistar and SD rats than in Lewis rats (Fig. 2a).
Wistar rats regained body weight more slowly after MCAO
(Fig. 2b); the marked weight gain between days 7 and 14 in
SD rats reflects the fact that many of the sickest SD rats (10)
died after 7 days and therefore did not contribute data to the
later time points. The modified Bederson neurological scores
were similar in all strains at 2 h after MCAO (Table 2). After
this time point, Lewis rats began to improve and this

improvement led to a significant difference among strains at
24 h. By 7 days after MCAO, modified Bederson neurological
scores were similar in all three strains (Fig. 3a). Computerized
evaluation of rotations shows that ratio of CW to CCW
rotations was greater in SD rats at 21 days after MCAO
(Fig. 3b). Early after MCAO Wistar rats actually increased

administered is displayed in Fig. 5. By 14 days after MCAO,
the modified Bederson neurological score returned to baseline
in Lewis rats, yet rotarod performance was impaired for
several weeks in this strain. The neurological score in SD rats,
conversely, was increased up to 21 days after MCAO, but
performance on the rotarod was not impaired after the first
week. Notably, automated analyses of CW and CCW rotations
showed that SD rats exhibited a prolonged tendency to rotate
in a CW direction, as demonstrated by an increase in the ratio
of CW to CCW turns. This tendency persisted throughout the
study period (and much longer than the increase in the modified Bederson neurological score).

7 days after MCAO, Wistar, and SD rats take longer to respond to adhesive
test on their affected forepaw than Lewis rats (a). Foot fault performance (b)
is similar among strains at all evaluated time points after MCAO. At 21 days
after stroke, Lewis rats perform less well on the rotarod than other strains
(d). Statistics are by Kruskal–Wallis H test; *P<0.05, strains differ from

strains (Fig. 4b), but Lewis rats performed worse on the

This study highlights several important issues when using
animal models to address long-term outcome after experimental stroke. Firstly, stroke-related mortality differs significantly
among strains. Secondly, the pattern of neurological deficits
after MCAO differs between strains of rats. Thirdly, the rate of
recovery differs among strains. Finally, computer automated
analyses is more sensitive than human observation for detecting neurological dysfunction.
Mortality was much greater in SD rats than in Lewis and
Wistar rats. The reasons for the increased mortality were not
assessed in this study, but early after MCAO (within 1–2 days),
cerebral edema and herniation are likely to contribute to death.
At later time points (1–3 weeks), however, death must be
attributed to other mechanisms. Weight loss was much greater
in SD rats that eventually died than in those that survived.
Whether this weight loss occurred because of decreased food
intake, increased catabolism, or a combination of these problems is unknown. What is clear from other studies is that some
animal strains have a predisposition to post-stroke infection
[13]. SD rats are known to have a more robust response to
stress with an increase in corticosterone in comparison to
Lewis rats [14, 15]. Elevated glucocorticoids are associated
with an increased risk of infection after stroke and immune
dysfunction in animal models of stroke [16–18]. It is thus
possible that the corticosterone response in SD rats
predisposed to infection leading to death. This hypothesis will
need to be tested in future studies.
Despite similar neurological scores (based upon a modification of the Bederson scale) among all three strains at 2 h
after MCAO, Lewis rats improved rapidly and had lower
scores at 24 h than Wistar and SD rats. The Bederson neurological score is heavily weighted towards rotational or circling
behavior [1]. If this were the only behavioral outcome
assessed, it would appear that Lewis rats experience much
milder strokes than Wistar and SD rats following the same
duration of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Lewis rats,

however, demonstrated marked and prolonged impairment on
the rotarod test in comparison to the other strains (especially
SD rats). Of note, while all animals performed similarly on the
rotarod prior to MCAO, the learning curve was steepest for
Lewis rats. This fact may have influenced post-ischemic
performance.
Wistar and SD rats had similar scores on the modified
Bederson test in the hours and days after MCAO, with return
to baseline sometime around 28 days after stroke. Automated
computer analyses of spontaneous rotational activity, however, shows a clear preference for CW versus CCW rotations in
SD rats throughout the entire study period. Despite this persistent stroke induced preference for CW turns, SD rats demonstrated minimal impairment on the rotarod, with return to
baseline by week 2 after MCAO. Wistar rats appear to be
somewhat intermediate between Lewis and SD rats exhibiting
a prolonged preference for CW rotations while also exhibiting
a more long-lasting impairment on the rotarod.
Prior studies showed that infarct volume and location appear to correlate with behavioral outcome in SD rats [19]. In

other strains, early neurological scores are less clearly correlated with 24-h infarct volume [20, 21]. Very little has been
written on the pattern or neurological impairments following
MCAO in different rat strains. In one study that evaluated
differences across eight different rat strains, striking differences in the performance on a variety of sensorimotor tasks
were noted 2 days after permanent MCAO, but long-term
outcomes were not assessed [21].
The differences in outcome among the three strains evaluated in our study raise questions about the pathological correlates of behavior. For instance, why do rats rotate in circles
after stroke? One potential explanation is that there is a motor
impairment on the affected sided and that the propulsive
efforts of the unaffected limbs result in the animal turning in
circles. A second explanation is that the animals develop a
perceptual hemi-neglect such that they ignore the left side of
space and rotate to the unaffected/right side. Another possible
explanation is that the rotational behavior is related to a
combination of motor and sensory deficits. Our data suggest
that sensory impairments must contribute greatly to the

Transl. Stroke Res. (2014) 5:569–576

circling/rotational behavior given that the preference for
clockwise rotations and the score on the modified Bederson
scale roughly parallel the impaired performance on adhesive
tape test. Wistar and SD rats both took longer to notice/react to
a piece of adhesive tape on the paw than Lewis rats, and the
return to baseline within Wistar and SD strains took longer
than in Lewis rats. The fact that SD rats performed very well
on the rotarod test as well as the foot fault test also suggests
that motor impairment is unlikely to contribute significantly to
the rotational/circling behavior. Finally, the rotational behavior at 24 h was strongly correlated with cortical infarct volume
in Wistar and SD rats. Large right hemisphere infarcts are
associated with both sensory and spatial hemineglect in
humans. Hemineglect in rats maps to the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex [22] (Hoff, 2007 #25583). The fact that
the cortical infarct volume was more predictive of circling
behavior than striatal infarct volume in our study suggests that
larger cortical infarcts affected these regions.
The foot fault test evaluates motor coordination [12] and
animals demonstrate clear impairments on this test after experimental stroke [23]. Our data do not show a strain-related
difference in performance on this task and also show a relatively rapid improvement to baseline (within 3 weeks in all
three strains). The rotarod also tests motor coordination and
balance [24]. We previously showed that deficits in rotarod
performance persist for months after stroke in Lewis rats
[25–27]; others also showed prolonged impairment on the
rotarod in Wistar rats after experimental stroke [28]. The
rotarod appears to be more sensitive than the foot fault test
for evaluating motor coordination/balance given that both
Lewis and Wistar rats return to baseline performance on the
foot fault test while still exhibiting impaired performance on
the rotarod.
In summary, our data highlight important differences in
outcome after MCAO among different rat strains. Despite
similar infarct volumes, mortality is greater in SD rats. SD
rats also display more profound sensory abnormalities with
impaired performance on the adhesive tape test and more
circling behavior. Lewis rats, on the other hand, exhibit profound and long-lasting deficits in motor coordination. Wistar
rats appear to be intermediate between Lewis and SD rats with
regards to behavioral outcomes. Given the differences in
performance in the array of tests used in this study, the choice
of rat strain and of behavioral outcomes need to be considered
carefully in pre-clinical stroke studies. These differences may
also be capitalized upon to better understand genetic contributions to injury. For instance, genetic microarrays could be
used to detect genes that are differentially regulated following
stroke among different strains. Our data also suggest that the
circling behavior of rats following stroke is related to perceptual issues (as opposed to motor impairment) and correlates
with the size of the cortical infarction. Finally, it is clear that
automated analyses of behavior are more sensitive that

intermittent investigator observation and can be used to detect
subtle differences in behavior weeks to months after stroke.
