Abstract: We explored the neuroprotective properties of natural plant-derived antioxidants
plastoquinone and thymoquinone (2-demethylplastoquinone derivative) modified to be
specifically accumulated in mitochondria. The modification was performed through chemical
conjugation of the quinones with penetrating cations: Rhodamine 19 or tetraphenylphosphonium.

Neuroprotective properties were evaluated in a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion.
We demonstrate that the mitochondria-targeted compounds, introduced immediately after
reperfusion, possess various neuroprotective potencies as judged by the lower brain damage
and higher neurological status. Plastoquinone derivatives conjugated with rhodamine were
the most efficient, and the least efficiency was shown by antioxidants conjugated with
tetraphenylphosphonium. Antioxidants were administered intraperitoneally or intranasally
with the latter demonstrating a high level of penetration into the brain tissue. The therapeutic
effects of both ways of administration were similar. Long-term administration of antioxidants
in low doses reduced the neurological deficit, but had no effect on the volume of brain
damage. At present, cationic decylrhodamine derivatives of plastoquinone appear to be the
most promising anti-ischemic mitochondria-targeted drugs of the quinone family. We
suggest these antioxidants could be potentially used for a stroke treatment.

1. Introduction
Disorders of brain blood supply, particularly ischemic stroke, result in pathological reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production by mitochondria, which is considered one of the key factors of neural cell
damage and death. Oxidative stress, i.e., the positive imbalance of ROS production over scavenging, is one
of the main factors of organ dysfunction in various ischemic pathologies. It explains why cell survival and
functional recovery depend on the prevention of ROS hyperproduction. Antioxidants are one of the basic
drugs used to achieve this effect [1]. This group includes compounds of various chemistry and mechanisms
of action, eventually affecting the free radical-induced oxidation of cellular structures and biomolecules
(for example, membrane lipid peroxidation, DNA nucleotide oxidation, or protein carbonylation).
The most efficient antioxidants include various plant and animal compounds, which have been selected
for millions of years of evolution possibly intended to maintain the cellular redox homeostasis. These
compounds include vitamins A and E, ubiquinone, thymoquinone, and some other, usually plant-derived
compounds, widely used in experimental and clinical studies. However, of note, ROS are also vitally
important components responsible for intra- and intercellular signaling [2]. Thus, antioxidant treatment
may change the ROS homeostasis of a cell and impair ROS-associated signaling. As a result, antioxidant
treatment may lead to reductive stress and even paradoxical aggravation of oxidative stress [3–5]. It is
likely antioxidants’ negative influence on signaling that explains the numerous failures of the clinical
usage of antioxidants [6].
The solution to the problem of the negative side effects of antioxidants may be based on their targeted
delivery to the needed destination on time, i.e., to the damaged organ exactly upon oxidative stress. As it
is known that mitochondria are one of the principle ROS sources in the cell under ischemia, the targeted
delivery of antioxidant molecules to these organelles might enhance their antioxidant activity and in turn
alleviate their effect on other ROS-signaling-related pathways of the cell.

Molecules 2015, 20

This approach was implemented by Murphy’s group through synthesis of mitochondria-targeted
ubiquinone and vitamin E, which have been shown to alleviate certain pathological conditions [7,8].
Plastoquinone, a component of plant photosystem II, might be another promising antioxidant for clinical
use. A chloroplast generating oxygen is exposed to much higher oxidative challenge than a mitochondrion,
which utilizes oxygen. Apparently, evolution resulted in the emergence of the electron transfer chain of
the chloroplast of another quinone in addition to the ubiquinone involved in the mitochondrial respiratory
chain of the same plant cell. In model systems, plastoquinone was shown to manifest better antioxidant
properties than ubiquinone [9,10]. The usage of plastoquinone in the form of mitochondria-targeted
compounds has been shown to enhance its antioxidative activity [11]. Another antioxidant with
experimentally proven efficiency is the main component of Nigella sativa extract, thymoquinone, which
if targeted by mitochondria might greatly increase its beneficial effect [12].
The aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective properties of several plastoquinone or
thymoquinone derivatives conjugated to various penetrating ions in an ischemic brain injury model.
2. Results
2.1. Mitochondria-Targeted Antioxidants Protect against Ischemic Brain Injury
We examined the protective effects of various mitochondria-targeted plastoquinone and
thymoquinone derivatives (Figure 1) on ischemic brain injury. Accordingly, using a model of the
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we tested the following compounds: 10-(6′-plastoquinonyl)
decyltriphenylphosphonium (SkQ1); 10-(6′-toluquinonyl) decyltriphenylphosphonium (SkQT1) and
10-(6′-plastoquinonyl) decylrhodamine 19 (SkQR1); 10-(6′-toluquinonyl) decylrhodamine 19 (SkQTR1).
Antioxidants were introduced intraperitonealy (i/p) immediately at the reperfusion onset at a dose of
1 μmol/kg. At 24 h after exposure of the rat brain to MCAO, we observed extensive cortical and striatal
damage and also variable partial damage to the hypothalamus and amygdala outside the vascular
territory of the middle cerebral artery. The treatment with SkQR1 and SkQTR1 significantly reduced the
infarct volume to 72.0% ± 16.1% and 68.0% ± 6.1% compared to the vehicle-treated group, respectively
(p < 0.05) (Figure 2A,B). Furthermore, ischemia caused significant swelling of the brain, occupying
about 15.0% ± 1.4% of the volume of the hemisphere. Meanwhile, SkQR1 and SkQTR1 diminished
brain swelling at least twofold to 7.1% ± 2.0% and 7.6% ± 1.6%, respectively (p < 0.05) (Figure 2A,C).
The two other antioxidants, SkQ1 and SkQT1, had no significant effect on the volume of brain damage
and swelling (Figure 2A–C). In addition, ischemia caused significant sensorimotor deficiency in the
contralateral limbs relative to the damaged hemisphere. While the intact rats before the induction of
ischemia scored 14.0 in a limb-placing test, and sham-operated animals scored 13.1 ± 0.5, rats after
ischemia demonstrated only 2.1 ± 0.2. The treatment with SkQ1 and SkQTR1 restored the neurological
status to 3.8 ± 0.5 and 4.0 ± 0.4 points, respectively (p < 0.05) (Figure 2D). SkQR1 was able to induce
a robust improvement of the total score in the limb-placing test to 7.0 ± 1.0 points.

decylrhodamine 19 (SkQR1); 10-(6′-toluquinonyl) decylrhodamine 19 (SkQTR1).
2.2. Dose-Dependent Neuroprotective Effects of SkQR1
As SkQR1 proved to be the most efficient neuroprotector, we explored the dose-dependence of the
compound’s neuroprotective activity. When compared with the vehicle group, the infarct volume was
significantly reduced by 28% after treatment with 1 and 2 µmol/kg SkQR1 (p < 0.05) (Figure 3A). The
treatment with 1 and 2 µmol/kg SkQR1 also significantly reduced brain swelling (p < 0.05) (Figure 3B).
There were no statistically significant differences in infarct volume and swelling after treatment with
0.5 µmol/kg SkQR1. However, the treatment with SkQR1 at all doses (0.5, 1, and 2 µmol/kg)
significantly improved functional recovery as measured by neurologic deficit scores (from 2.8 ± 0.7 to
6.8 ± 0.5, 7.0 ± 1.0, 5.3 ± 0.5, respectively) (Figure 3C).
2.3. Neuroprotective Effect of Long-Term Treatment by SkQR1
In the next experiment, rats were treated with 0.1 µmol/kg SkQR1 i/p for four days. The first injection
was made simultaneously with the reperfusion onset, and the other injections were made within a period
of 24 h. Long-term treatment by SkQR1 had a trend of mitigating brain damage on day seven after
MCAO (Figure 4A). The neurological status assessment showed spontaneous sensorimotor function
recovery after ischemia even in untreated rats. However, SkQR1-treated rats demonstrated faster
recovery of the sensorimotor functions of limbs starting from postoperative day three compared to the
MCAO + Vehicle group. On day seven, the neurological score in SkQR1-treated rats exceeded the
value for the MCAO + Vehicle group by 2 points.

2.4. Kinetics of SkQR1 Accumulation in the Brain
In order to explore the permeation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for SkQR1 after i/p or intranasal
(i/n) injections, we analyzed its distribution in the brain using tissue sections sampled 1 h after different
ways of administration at a dose of 1 µmol/kg. We observed that SkQR1 fluorescence in the brain was
visible 1 h after i/n instillation. Remarkably, the fluorescence level in the ipsilateral hemisphere was
higher than in the contralateral hemisphere, which indicates that SkQR1 directly penetrates into the
brain when the i/n way of administration is used (Figure 5).

Instead, no global fluorescence of SkQR1 was observed after i/p injection (not shown) except for
scattered bright fluorescent spots apparently attributed to the blood vessel cells. Apparently, for i/p
injection, the BBB constrains penetration of SkQR1.
2.5. Neuroprotective Effect of Intranasal Administration of SkQR1
Our findings on the more effective SkQR1 penetration of the BBB after intranasal administration
provided strong rationale to examine whether SkQR1 is able to protect brain tissue against
ischemia-induced damage after such a method of administration. To address this question, we used
instillation of SkQR1 into the nasal cavity at a dose of 1 µmol/kg or vehicle at the start of reperfusion.
Analysis of the brain damage indicates that SkQR1 reduced infarct volume to 63.7% ± 15.0% vs. the
vehicle-treated group (p < 0.05) (Figure 6A). To assess the beneficial effect of intranasal SkQR1 on
neurological outcome, the rats were scored according to the severity of the neurological deficit. The
results shown in Figure 6B demonstrate that rats treated with SkQR1 after MCAO had milder
neurological deficits than animals from the MCAO + i/n Vehicle group.

3. Discussion
The study employed plant-derived mitochondria-targeted quinones such as plastoquinone or
thymoquinone conjugated with penetrating ions decyltriphenylphosphonium or decylrhodamine 19 to
obtain a lipophilic cation that easily penetrates through membranes. These antioxidant-carrying cations
are specifically targeted to mitochondria, electrophoretically driven by electric potential formed by
the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It was recently shown that these compounds are easily reduced by
the respiratory chain, penetrate through model and natural membranes, specifically accumulate in

Molecules 2015, 20

14495

mitochondria in an electrophoretic fashion, and strongly inhibit H2O2-induced apoptosis at pico- and
nanomolar concentrations in cell cultures [11,12].
The electric locomotive principle concept of antioxidant delivery to the mitochondria was first
suggested by Murphy and Smith [7]. They synthesized a compound composed of a thiobutyl residue
chemically linked to a phosphonium cation. Later, thiobutyl was replaced by ubiquinone and this
compound was named MitoQ [13]. Thereafter, MitoQ’s therapeutic potential was studied in various
pathological models associated with oxidative stress [14–16]. However, MitoQ was administered
predominantly before the induction of pathological conditions, which complicated the assessment of
the drug’s clinical potential, since it was not clear whether it retained potency after being introduced in
a period after the incidence of oxidative challenge (these conditions better reflect the clinical situation).
Moreover, there are practically no experimental studies demonstrating MitoQ’s efficiency proven in
brain pathologies. In the study by Hobbs et al., a nulled positive effect of intracerebral MitoQ injection
into the striatum was shown on a neonatal ischemia/hypoxia model [17].
Later, Skulachev’s group also synthesized mitochondria-targeted antioxidants containing positively
charged phosphonium or rhodamine moieties tethered to plastoquinone by a decane linker [11]. Some
of these mitochondria-targeted antioxidants demonstrated protective effects in oxidative stress-associated
pathologies, such as ischemic brain, kidney, or bladder, rhabdomyolysis, or traumatic brain injury [18–23].
However, in most cases in these studies, the antioxidants were also administered before injury.
In the present study, we explored the neuroprotective properties of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants
administered after brain ischemia/reperfusion, analyzing different doses and ways of administration.
Moreover, we compared the therapeutic efficiency of four mitochondria-targeted antioxidants differing
in antioxidant moieties as well as penetrating ions. The conjugation with rhodamine residue has been
chosen due to the simplicity of tracking the compound by fluorescence analysis, with a proven
high permeability of rhodamines for membranes and their biological activity [24–27]. The highest
neuroprotective efficiency was observed for antioxidants conjugated with rhodamine 19. SkQTR1 and
SkQR1 equally diminished the damage area and the brain edema. However, the effect on neurologic
deficiency was manifested more in SkQR1-treated animals when compared to other antioxidants.
These data considered SkQR1 as a more efficient mitochondria-targeted antioxidant and it was chosen
for further experiments.
The fluorescence-based study of SkQR1 penetration into the brain did not reveal SkQR1 fluorescence
in the brain tissues when the drug was administered i/p. The confocal microscopy analysis of the brain
sections revealed only small fluorescent regions, presumably blood vessels, which indicates that SkQR1
hardly passes through the BBB. However, intranasal administration into one nostril resulted in quite a
strong fluorescence in the whole ipsilateral hemisphere, whereas in the contralateral hemisphere,
fluorescence was very weak. These data suggest the possibility of direct delivery of SkQR1 into the
brain, bypassing the BBB in case of intranasal administration. It is well known that drug instillation into
the nasal cavity may ensure the targeted delivery of the drug into the brain through perivascular and
perineural spaces [28]. Nevertheless, we detected no difference in SkQR1 neuroprotective effects
between i/p and i/n administrations. Thus, SkQR1 neuroprotective activity does not correlate with its
penetration into the brain, which may suggest that the effect is mediated by the protection of other
tissues, for example, the endothelium. Brain ischemia is known to cause endothelial dysfunction [29],
thus the protection of the endothelium may mitigate the nervous tissue damage [30].

Molecules 2015, 20

14496

Interestingly, we revealed differences in the neuroprotective effects of antioxidants conjugated with
triphenylphosphonium and rhodamine 19. Ostensibly, that may be explained by the better penetration
capacity of the molecules carrying rhodamine 19 as a hydrophobic cation, as it has been shown in various
models [31]. However, we can not exclude some specific protective effects of the rhodamine residues.
The beneficial effect of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants that are lipophilic by their chemistry is
greatly determined by the lipophilicity of oxygen itself and the majority of ROS (e.g., superoxide).
Also, their positive effects may depend on parameters such as oxygen radical scavenging, penetration
capability, and mitochondrial accumulation level and rate. Hydrophilic oxidants such as H2O2 are better
scavenged by hydrophilic antioxidants (e.g., N-acetyl cysteine), while mitochondria-targeted antioxidants
are less effective in scavenging H2O2 [32,33]. This premise dictates the necessity of thoroughly testing
the whole range of such compounds for their neuroprotective efficiency, which may significantly vary
depending on the nature of the antioxidant component and/or of the penetrating cation. In our study,
we used plant quinones plastoquinone and thymoquinone as antioxidant components. Thymoquinone
(2-demethylplastoquinone derivative) is the basic active component of black cumin (Nigella sativa)
extract [34], which has demonstrated antioxidant properties in a number of studies [35,36]. Modern
pharmacological studies have demonstrated that crude extracts of Nigella sativa seeds and purified
thymoquinone might have neuroprotective effects against amyloid-β peptide-induced neurotoxicity in
rat primary neurons [37]; 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurotoxicity [38]; subarachnoid hemorrhage in
rats [39]; global cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat hippocampi [40,41]; the kainate model of
temporal lobe epilepsy [42] or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+); and rotenone toxicities of primary
dopaminergic cultures [43].
Plastoquinone shares most chemical properties with thymoquinone and is present in all plant cells,
being a photosystem II component. Plastoquinone was suggested to carry an antioxidative potency
higher than ubiquinone since it occupies the compartment (chloroplast) exposed to an aggressive
light-induced oxidative challenge due to the formation of molecular oxygen and to related reactive
oxygen species [9,10]. However, to date, its antioxidant activity in various pathologies has scarcely
been described in literature.
We may assume that the targeted delivery of thymoquinone and plastoquinone to the mitochondria
might significantly increase the drugs’ antioxidant efficiency. Although mitochondria-targeted
plastoquinone has been studied for several years [44], we are the first to compare its anti-stroke
activity to that of mitochondria-targeted thymoquinone administered after ischemia.
Our study shows that in terms of the integral assessment of neuroprotective activity (the volume
of the ischemic zone, brain edema, neurological deficiency alleviation), decylrhodamine-conjugated
plastoquinone demonstrates the highest brain protection efficiency against ischemia. We conclude that
therapeutic efficiency selection is needed for all antioxidants, including those targeted at mitochondria.
We have shown recently that SkQR1 protection was mediated by its direct antioxidant effect, as well
as by induction of signaling pathways stimulating the cell’s antioxidant protection, and, in particular,
by inducing the synthesis of erythropoietin, a universal cytoprotector [20], and increasing GSK-3
phosphorylation, which is also a pro-survival signal [45]. This proves the possibility of some
antioxidant-mediated beneficial antioxidant activity, which may be successfully used.

4. Experimental Section
4.1. Use of Animals
The animal protocols used in this work were evaluated and approved by the institutional animal
ethics committee (Protocol 2010_36). They are in accordance with the Federation of Laboratory
Animal Science Associations (FELASA) guidelines. The experiments were performed on outbred
white male rats (320–350 g). The animals had unlimited access to food and water and were kept in
cages with a temperature-controlled environment (20 ± 1 °C) with light on from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. For all
surgical procedures rats are anesthetized with i/p injections of 300 mg/kg (12%) chloral hydrate. A
feedback-controlled heating pad maintained the core temperature (37.0 ± 0.5 °C) during ischemia,
supplemented with an infrared lamp until awake.
4.2. Chemicals
The chemical structure of compounds used in this study and the protocol of their synthesis are
shown in Figure 1. The conjugates were synthesized by the Institute of Mitoengineering Lomonosov
Moscow State University as previously described [11,12].
4.3. Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Model of Focal Ischemia
MCAO procedure and the sham operation were performed as previously described [46]. Briefly,
rats were anesthetized with i/p injections of 300 mg/kg chloral hydrate. The right common carotid
artery was exposed through a midline cervical incision. A heparinized intraluminal silicon-coated
monofilament (diameter, 0.25 mm) was introduced via the external carotid artery into the internal
carotid artery to occlude the blood supply to the middle cerebral artery region. A feedback-controlled
heating pad supplemented with an infrared lamp was used to maintain the core temperature (37.0 ± 0.5 °C)
during ischemia. After 60 min of occlusion, the filament was gently pulled out and the external carotid
artery was permanently closed by cauterization. In sham-operated rats, the right common carotid artery
was exposed and the external carotid artery was electrocoagulated without introducing the filament
into the internal carotid artery. Ischemically damaged volume for each group was normalized to the
mean for the group MCAO + Vehicle.
4.4. Study Design and Drug Treatment
4.4.1. Comparing Various Mitochondria-Targeted Quinone Derivatives
The aim was to choose the most efficient mitochondria-targeted antioxidant in a group containing
SkQ1, SkQT1, SkQTR1, and SkQR1 injected i/p at dose of 1 μmol/kg immediately after the beginning
of reperfusion. The rats were randomly divided into the following groups: (1) SHAM + Vehicle (n = 6),
(2) MCAO + Vehicle (n = 7), (3) MCAO + SkQ1 (n = 6), (4) MCAO + SkQT1 (n = 6), (5)
MCAO + SkQTR1 (n = 6), and (6) MCAO + SkQR1 1 (n = 6).

Molecules 2015, 20

14498

4.4.2. SkQR1 Dose-Dependent Effect Analysis
We analyzed groups MCAO + SkQR1 0.5 and MCAO + SkQR1 2, which received SkQR1 at doses
of 0.5 and 2 μmol/kg, respectively. Substances were i/p injected immediately after the beginning
of reperfusion.
4.4.3. Analysis of a Long-Term SkQR1 Treatment
In this set of experiments, we studied the neuroprotective activity of SkQR1 administered chronically
at low doses. SkQR1 at a dose of 0.1 μmol/kg was i/p administered immediately after reperfusion and
for the consecutive 4 days (1 injection per day), and the MCAO + SkQR1 0.1 group was formed.
4.4.4. Intranasal Administration
The rats were treated by i/n administration of SkQR1 immediately after reperfusion. Nasal drops
(saline (20 µL) containing SkQR1 at a dose 1 μmol/kg) was administered with a small pipette every 5 min
into both sides of the nasal cavity with 5 µL each instillation (total time of administration = 20 min).
Rats were randomly divided into the following groups: MCAO + i/n Vehicle (n = 8), MCAO + i/n
SkQR1 (n = 7).
4.5. MRI Studies
Infarct volume was quantified by analyzing brain MRI images obtained 24 h after the MCAO as
described previously [47]. Brain swelling was also measured in the MRI images and calculated using
the formula: swelling (edema) = (volume of right hemisphere − volume of left hemisphere)/volume of
left hemisphere. Twenty-four hours after brain ischemia/reperfusion the rats underwent MRI of the
brain. Under chloral hydrate anesthesia, the animal’s position was fixed with a special device which also
maintained the animal’s temperature. MRI scans were acquired on a 7T MRI scanner (Bruker BioSpec
70/30 USR, Ettlingen, Germany). The imaging protocol included a T2-weighted image sequence (time
to repetition = 4500 ms; time to echo = 12 ms; slice thickness = 0.8 mm).
4.6. Limb-Placing Test
The modified version of the limb-placing test consisting of seven tasks was used to assess forelimb
and hindlimb responses to tactile and proprioceptive stimulation [48]. The rats were habituated for
handling and tested before operation and after the reperfusion for 24 h. For each task, the following
scores were used: 2 points, normal response; 1 point, delayed and/or incomplete response; 0 points, no
response. Over seven tasks, the mean score was evaluated.
4.7. Analysis of SkQR1 Accumulation in the Brain
Rats were injected i/p or i/n with 1 µmol/kg SkQR1 and brains were excised after 1 h, fixed in 4%
formaldehyde with PBS and sliced using a VibroSlice microtome (World Precision Instruments,
Sarasota, FL, USA) into 100 µm thick sections. Slices were imaged with a LSM510 inverted confocal

Molecules 2015, 20

14499

microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Jena, Germany) with excitation at 543 nm and emission collected at
560–590 nm. As a negative control, organs from untreated animals were used.
4.8. Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using STATISTICA 7.0 for Windows (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK,
USA). All data are presented as means ± standard error of means (SEM). Variance homogeneity was
assessed with Levene’s test. Statistical differences between groups in the data of infarct volume and
brain swelling were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test or Student’s t-test for
independent samples. Statistical differences in the limb-placing tests between groups were analyzed
using the Kruskal-Wallis test with the Mann-Whitney u-test (the Bonferroni post-hoc correction was
applied) or Mann-Whitney u-test for independent samples. Values for p < 0.05 were assumed to be
statistically significant.
