BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
Recent clinical trials report that metformin, an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) used to treat type 2 diabetes,
significantly reduces the risk of stroke by actions that are independent of its glucose-lowering effects. However, the underlying
molecular mechanisms are not known. Here, we tested the possibility that acute metformin preconditioning confers
neuroprotection by pre-activation of AMPK-dependent autophagy in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO).

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with either vehicle, an AMPK inhibitor, Compound C, or an autophagy inhibitor,
3-methyladenine, and were injected with a single dose of metformin (10 mg kg−1, i.p.). Then, AMPK activity and autophagy
biomarkers in the brain were assessed. At 24 h after metformin treatment, rats were subjected to pMCAO; infarct volume,
neurological deficits and cell apoptosis were evaluated 24 and 96 h later.

KEY RESULTS
A single dose of metformin significantly activated AMPK and induced autophagy in the brain. The enhanced autophagic
activity was inhibited by Compound C pretreatment. Furthermore, acute metformin preconditioning significantly reduced
infarct volume, neurological deficits and cell apoptosis during a subsequent focal cerebral ischaemia. The neuroprotection
mediated by metformin preconditioning was fully abolished by Compound C and partially inhibited by 3-methyladenine.

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
These results provide the first evidence that acute metformin preconditioning induces autophagy by activation of brain AMPK,
which confers neuroprotection against subsequent cerebral ischaemia. This suggests that metformin, a well-known
hypoglycaemic drug, may have a practical clinical use for stroke prevention.

Introduction

Methods

Metformin is one of the most widely used hypoglycaemic
drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Arunachalam
et al., 2014; Schulte et al., 2014). Aside from lowering blood
glucose levels, metformin has been found to exert beneficial
effects in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases including
stroke. Recent clinical trials report that metformin significantly reduces the risk of stroke by actions that are independent of its glucose-lowering effects (Nathan, 1998; Selvin and
Hirsch, 2008; Cheng et al., 2014). However, the underlying
molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown.
Emerging evidence indicates that most of the beneficial
effects of metformin are mediated by activation of AMP
kinase (AMPK; see Alexander et al., 2013), a major regulator of
cellular energy homeostasis in the whole body (Russo et al.,
2013). AMPK can be phosphorylated and activated in
response to an increase in the intracellular AMP-to-ATP ratio
(Hardie, 2003). Once activated, AMPK leads to the conservation of intracellular ATP levels via multiple downstream pathways, including autophagy (Hardie, 2011). Autophagy is an
evolutionary-conserved process for the degradation and recycling of cellular constituents, participating in bioenergetic
management during energy stress (Hale et al., 2013). Several
lines of evidence suggest that autophagy can be induced by
metformin via an AMPK-dependent manner in peripheral
tissues. For example, metformin induces autophagy by activating AMPK in a wide variety of malignant tumours
(Harhaji-Trajkovic et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2012). More importantly, acute preconditioning with a single dose of metformin
was shown to induce AMPK-mediated autophagy in the
heart, which subsequently conferred protection against
cardiac dysfunction following diabetes or myocardial ischaemia (Calvert et al., 2008).
Recently, it has been proposed that autophagy has a protective role in cerebral ischaemia (Viscomi et al., 2012; Wang
et al., 2012; Papadakis et al., 2013). In particular, preactivation of autophagy in the brain was found to markedly
enhance brain ischaemic tolerance, as it facilitated cellular
energy production, limited endoplasmic reticulum stress and
prevented neuronal apoptosis during subsequent ischaemic
exposure (Sheng et al., 2010; 2012). On consideration of the
above evidence, in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that preconditioning with metformin activates
autophagy via an AMPK-dependent manner in the brain,
thereby conferred neuroprotection against focal cerebral
ischaemia in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion (pMCAO).

Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–280 g) were purchased from
the Experimental Animals Center of Nanjing Medical University. Animals were maintained in individually ventilated
cages in a standard animal room at 20–24°C and relative
humidity (30%–70%) with a 12 h light/dark cycle and given
free access to food and water. Animal Care and Management
Committee of Qingdao Municipal Hospital approved the
whole study protocol (permit No.QMHEC-130115). In total
186 rats were included in this study. All animal experiments
were conducted in accordance with Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of
Health, and were reported in accordance with the ARRIVE
guidelines (Kilkenny et al., 2010; McGrath et al., 2010).

Drugs administration and
experimental groups
Metformin
hydrochloride,
6-[4-(2-piperidin-1-ylethoxy)
phenyl]-3-pyridin-4-ylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine (Compound
C, an AMPK inhibitor, CAS Number: 866405-64-3), and
3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA. Rats
were randomly allocated to six groups using a random
number table generated by SPSS software 13.0 (IBM Inc.,
Armonk, NY, USA), and received treatment as shown in
Figure 1. In view of the fact that a therapeutic dose of metformin led to the accumulation of lactic acid in the brain (Li
et al., 2010), a subtherapeutic dose of metformin (10 mg kg−1,
i.p.) was used in this study. The administration route and
dose for Compound C were chosen according to a previous
study from McCullough et al. (2005). The dose and administration route for 3-MA were determined based on a previous
study from Sheng et al. (2010). It should be noted that treatment with Compound C or 3-MA at the doses used did
not significantly affect physiological parameters including
PaCO2, PaO2, blood pressure and blood glucose levels in rats
(Supporting Information Table S1), and no signs of neurotoxicity, such as hind-limb paralysis, vocalization and reduced
food intake, were observed. Of note, saline was used as
vehicle in this study. All drug and molecular nomenclatures
in this article followed Alexander et al. (2013).

Western blot analysis
At the indicated time after metformin administration, rats
were killed. The brain tissue of each rat was homogenized and

the total proteins were extracted by RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Inc., Shanghai, China). Different samples with an equal
amount of protein were separated on 8–12% SDS polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and
blocked in 5% BSA powder in 1 × Tris-buffered saline (TBS)
with 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 2 h. Membranes
were incubated overnight at 4°C with a mouse monoclonal
antibody against p-AMPK (Thr172) (1:600; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Boston, MA, USA), AMPK (1:800; Cell Signaling
Technology Inc.), p-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC, A major
downstream target of AMPK activation) (Ser79) (1:1000; Cell
Signaling Technology Inc.), ACC (1:1000; Cell Signaling
Technology Inc.), microtubule-associated protein 1 light
chain 3 (LC3) (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) and P62 (1:1000;
Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), then washed with 1 × TBS
with 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with HRP-coupled secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. After being
washed, protein bands were detected with chemiluminescent
HRP substrate (Thermo Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA.) for
5 min at room temperature and exposed to an X-ray film. The

band intensity was analysed using Quantity One software
4.6.2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and normalized to a loading control, β-actin.

Immunofluorescence analysis
Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out as previously
described (Gao et al., 2012). Twenty-four hours after metformin administration, rats were deeply anaesthetized (for
anaesthetic procedure see later section, pMCAO) and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by a solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were removed and
post-fixed in 4% PFA solution overnight. After being dehydrated in alcohol, the brains were embedded in paraffin and
cut into 4–5 μm sections. Afterwards, sections were deparaffinized, hydrated in distilled water, treated with 3% H2O2 for
10 min to remove endogenous peroxidase activity and
washed again with PBS. Sections were then permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 10% normal
goat serum for 2 h at room temperature and incubated in the
primary antibodies against LC3 (1:250, Sigma–Aldrich Inc.)

4°C for 24 h. The sections were rinsed with PBS and sequentially incubated, respectively, with tetramethylrhodamine
conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Beyotime Inc.) in a
humidified container for 1 h at 37°C. Then the sections were
further incubated with 0.5 mg mL−1 DAPI for 10 min. After
that, the sections were washed with PBS and sealed with a
coverslip. The slides were viewed with a fluorescence microscopy (Olympus Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and fluorescence intensity was measured using Image J software 2.1 (Bethesda, MD,
USA) by observers who were blinded to the experimental
groups. Of note, to ensure the specificity of the immunofluorescence procedure, a control experiment was performed in
which the primary antibody was omitted. Under these conditions, no staining for LC3 was observed (Supporting Information Figure S1).

Transmission electron
microscopic examination
The transmission electron microscopic examination was performed as previously described (Gao et al., 2012; Jiang et al.,
2013b). Briefly, brain tissue was sliced into small sections,
immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 h, dehydrated in
graded ethanol and then embedded in epoxy resin. Afterwards, these selections were cut into ultrathin sections (60–
70 nm) with an ultramicrotome, poststained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate, and then subsequently examined
under a transmission electron microscope. Autophagosome
counting was performed by observers who were blinded to
the experimental groups, using a protocol described previously (Sheng et al., 2010).

pMCAO
Twenty-four hours after metformin treatment, rats were
anaesthetized with urethane (800 mg kg−1) and α-chloralose
(40 mg kg−1) i.p. We chose urethane and α-chloralose as anaesthetics because they caused little interference with cardiovascular reflexes, arterial blood pressure or cerebral blood flow
(CBF), that might affect stroke outcome (Wyler, 1974; Leoni
et al., 2011), and, therefore, were suitable for studies of central
cardiovascular regulation and cerebrovascular diseases.
However, it is recognized that this combination is not recommended for recovery experiments because of the known toxicity of urethane and the potential for involuntary tremors on
recovery from α-chloralose. The depth of anaesthesia was
monitored by assessing the withdrawal reflex to footpad
pinching. pMCAO was performed by investigators who were
blinded to the experimental groups. Briefly, the right
common carotid artery, external carotid artery and internal
carotid artery (ICA) were isolated through a midline incision.
A 30 mm length of nylon filament (Φ 0.26 mm), with its tip
rounded by heating near a flame, was inserted from the right
external carotid artery into the lumen of ICA, and then
advanced to the Circle of Willis to occlude the origin of the
right middle cerebral artery. The filament remained there
until the rat was killed. The reduction of the CBF was confirmed by a laser-Doppler flow metre (Moor Instruments Inc.,
Axminster, UK), as described previously (Jiang et al., 2012).
Rats in the sham-operated group were subjected to the filament insertion into the ICA but with no reduction in CBF. Our
preliminary findings showed that metformin did not signifi-

cantly affect body temperature (Supporting Information
Figure S2), and in order to rule out the influence of hypothermia on stroke outcome, body temperature was maintained in
the range of 37.0 ± 0.5°C with a heating pad until rats were
killed. In addition, to determine whether metformin preconditioning affects physiological parameters during pMCAO,
the left femoral arteries of rats from group 1 and group 2 were
cannulated to obtain the values of PaCO2, PaO2, BP and blood
glucose levels. These physiological parameters were measured
before and at 24 h after pMCAO.

Neurobehavioural testing
Neurobehavioural tests were performed at 24 and 96 h after
pMCAO using a 5-point scale (Bederson et al., 1986) by
observers who were blinded to the experimental groups: 0,
rats extended both forelimbs towards the floor when gently
suspended 1 m above the floor and with no other signs of
neurological deficit; 1, rats consistently flexed the forelimb
contralateral to pMCAO; 2, rats circled towards the contralateral side when the tail was pulled; 3, rats spontaneously
circled towards the contralateral side when allowed to move
freely; 4, no spontaneous movement with an apparent
depressed level of consciousness.

2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
(TTC) staining
TTC staining was performed to evaluate the infarct volume by
investigators who were blinded to the experimental groups.
Twenty-four hours and 96 h after pMCAO, rats were killed
under deep anaesthesia and the brains were rapidly removed,
then sectioned coronally into five 3 mm-thick slices using a
rat brain matrix. The slices were kept in the dark and stained
with 2% TTC for 30 min and then fixed with 4% PFA. The
infarct volume was evaluated by Image Pro-Plus 5.1 analysis
system (Media Cybernetics Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA)
using Swanson’s method, which corrects for oedema
(Swanson et al., 1990).

TUNEL assay
Twenty-four hours after pMCAO, rats were deeply anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with PBS, followed by a
solution containing 4% PFA. Brains were removed, and the
TUNEL assay was performed by using a cell death detection
kit (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD; Roche, Pleasanton,
CA, USA) as previously described (Jiang et al., 2013a). Afterwards, sections were costained with DAPI, and were viewed
under a fluorescence microscopy. Cells labelled with green
fluorescence in the peri-infarct region were identified as
TUNEL-positive cells. For each slide, cell counting was performed on three randomly selected non-overlapping fields in
the peri-infarct region by observers who were blinded to the
experimental groups. Data obtained in every field were added
together to make a final data count for each slide and
expressed as % of total cell numbers.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by the SPSS software 16.0.
Statistically significant differences were evaluated by an independent sample t-test and one- or two-way ANOVA followed by
least significant difference post hoc test. For neurological

deficits, Mann–Whitney U-test was used for comparisons
between two groups. The mortality of rats after pMCAO was
assessed with the Chi-squared method. With the exception of
mortality and neurological deficit, the data are expressed as
mean ± SD. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Metformin activated AMPK and induced
autophagy in the brain

Rats received a single dose of metformin (10 mg kg−1; i.p.),
and the ratio of p-AMPK (Thr172)/AMPK was detected 6, 12,
24 and 48 h later by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 2A
and B, the p-AMPK (Thr172)/AMPK ratio changed in a monophasic manner: significantly increased from 6 h, peaked at
12 h, started to decrease from 24 h, and was return to the
baseline value at 48 h. We subsequently determined the levels
of LC3-II, an autophagy biomarker, at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after
metformin treatment. As demonstrated in Figure 2A–C,
LC3-II started to increase from 12 h, peaked at 24 h,
and began to decrease from 48 h. These findings were confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis using an anti-LC3
antibody with higher selectivity for LC3-II, as rats received
metformin showed higher LC3-II immunoreactivity in brain
than vehicle-treated rats (Figure 2D). Additionally, transmission electron microscopic examination detected more
autophagosomes with double-membrane structure in the
brain of metformin-treated rats (Figure 2E). All these findings
indicate that metformin activated AMPK and induced
autophagy in the brain.

Inhibition of AMPK by Compound C
significantly attenuated metformin-induced
autophagy in brain
To further investigate the role of AMPK in metformininduced autophagy in the brain, rats were pretreated with a
single dose of Compound C (20 mg kg−1; i.p.) before they
received metformin. The inhibitory effect of Compound C on
metformin-induced AMPK activation (indicated by ratios of
p-AMPK/AMPK and p-ACC/ACC) is shown in Figure 3A–C.
Pretreatment with Compound C markedly inhibited LC3-II
levels by 38% (Figure 3D and E, P < 0.05) at 24 h after metformin treatment, and this result was further confirmed by
immunofluorescence analysis (Figure 3G). Meanwhile, the
metformin-induced reduction of P62 was also reversed by
Compound C pretreatment (Figure 3D and F, P < 0.05),
further suggesting that inhibition of AMPK by Compound C
significantly attenuated the activation of autophagy induced
by metformin. It should be noted that Compound C itself did
not significantly affect the basal activity of AMPK or
autophagy, as both the p-AMPK (Thr172)/AMPK ratio and the
LC3-II level in rat brain stayed unchanged after a single dose
of Compound C alone (Supporting Information Figure S3).

Metformin preconditioning reduced infarct
volume, neurological deficits and cell
apoptosis after pMCAO
Twenty-four hours after metformin treatment, rats were subjected to pMCAO. This time point was selected based on the
3150

British Journal of Pharmacology (2014) 171 3146–3157

above results, which showed that autophagic activity in the
brain peaked at 24 h after metformin administration.
Five rats died before completion of the experiment and
were excluded from the study: one rat (8.3%) in group 1, one
rat (8.3%) in group 4, one rat in group 5 (8.3%) and two rats
in group 6 (16.7%). Post-mortem examinations did not reveal
the occurrence of intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage
in any of these animals, and no significant differences were
found between the number of deaths in each group. Twentyfour hours after pMCAO, TTC staining, Benderson neurobehavioural tests and TUNEL assay were used to evaluate infarct
volume, neurological deficits and cell apoptosis respectively.
As indicated by Figure 4A and B, metformin preconditioning
markedly decreased the infarct volume following subsequent
pMCAO by 29% (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, metformin preconditioning significantly attenuated neurological deficits in rats
subjected to pMCAO [median of group 1: 2, median of group
2: 1; P < 0.05] (Figure 4C). In addition, metformin preconditioning also ameliorated cell apoptosis in the peri-infarct
region, as the % of TUNEL-positive cells was dramatically
reduced by metformin (Figure 4D, 14.2 vs. 25.7% of total cell
numbers; P < 0.05). More intriguingly, metformin at the dose
used significantly reduced the infarct volume and neurological deficits at 96 h after pMCAO, implying the neuroprotective effects of metformin could last for at least 4 days
(Figure 5). It should be noted that metformin, at the dose
used, did not significantly affect physiological parameters
(including PaCO2, PaO2, BP and blood glucose levels, Table 1)
or CBF (Supporting Information Figure S4A) before or after
pMCAO when compared with those in vehicle-treated rats. In
addition, no difference in brain lactate levels was observed
between the vehicle- and metformin-treated rats at 24 h
after pMCAO (Supporting Information Figure S4B). Taken
together, these results indicate that preconditioning with a
single dose of metformin could provide a long-lasting neuroprotection without causing lactate accumulation.

AMPK-mediated autophagy was involved
in the neuroprotection induced by
metformin preconditioning
In order to investigate the role of AMPK-mediated autophagy
in metformin-induced neuroprotection, rats were pretreated
with a single dose of Compound C (20 mg kg−1; i.p.) or 3-MA
(200 nmol; i.c.v.) before they received metformin administration. The inhibitory effect of 3-MA on metformin-induced
autophagy had been confirmed by Western blotting (Supporting Information Figure S5). Twenty-four hours after pMCAO,
the infarct volume and neurological deficits were measured
by TTC staining and Benderson neurobehavioural tests
respectively. As shown in Figure 4A and B, the metformininduced reduction in infarct volume was fully abolished by
Compound C and partially attenuated by 3-MA. In support of
these findings, Benderson neurobehavioural testing demonstrated that the amelioration in neurological deficits induced
by metformin was reversed by Compound C or 3-MA
(Figure 4C), indicating that inhibition of AMPK or autophagy
abolished the neuroprotection provided by metformin preconditioning. It is noteworthy that Compound C or 3-MA at
the dose used, when given alone, did not exacerbate the
stroke outcome (Supporting Information Figure S6).

Discussion
The primary finding of this study is that acute preconditioning with a single dose of metformin induces autophagy in an
AMPK-dependent manner in the brain, which subsequently
reduces infarct volume, cell apoptosis and neurological deficits caused by focal cerebral ischaemia (Figure 6).
AMPK is a major regulator of cellular and whole-body
energy homeostasis, which can be phosphorylated and activated in response to an increase in the intracellular AMP/ATP
ratio (Hardie, 2003). Once activated, AMPK leads to the conservation of intracellular ATP levels via multiple downstream
pathways, including autophagy. As an AMPK activator, metformin has been revealed to induce autophagy through an
AMPK-dependent manner in peripheral tissues including the

heart. In diabetic OVE26 mice, Xie et al. (2011) found that
metformin activated AMPK and enhanced cardiac autophagy,
which was associated with an improvement in heart function.
Meanwhile, a recent study from He et al. (2013) revealed that
metformin prevented diabetic cardiomyopathy by inducing
AMPK-mediated autophagy. Furthermore, Calvert et al. (2008)
found that preconditioning with a single dose of metformin
induced autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner, which
subsequently provided protection against cardiac dysfunction
following myocardial ischaemia. In addition to the heart,
AMPK has also been identified in the brain, uniquely localized
in neurons and astrocytes (Turnley et al., 1999). In the current
study, we demonstrated for the first time that a single dose of
metformin activated AMPK and induced autophagy in the
brain. In addition, we found that this enhanced autophagic

activity was inhibited by Compound C pretreatment, indicating that metformin induced autophagy by activating brain
AMPK. It is noteworthy that AMPK can activate autophagy by
many signalling pathways. Several lines of evidence suggest
that AMPK activation enhances autophagy by inhibiting the
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a conserved Ser/Thr
kinase that negatively regulates autophagy (Zhang et al.,
2013). AMPK can also enhance autophagy by directly phosphorylating UNC-51 like kinase 1 (Kim et al., 2011). Hence,
the precise pathway by which AMPK activates autophagy in
the brain should be investigated further.
The most exciting finding in the present study is that
preconditioning with a single dose of metformin significantly
reduced infarct volume, cell apoptosis and neurological defi3154

cits in the both acute (within 24 h) and subacute phase
(within 96 h) of ischaemic stroke. These beneficial effects
were reversed by inhibition of AMPK or autophagy, indicating that the neuroprotection of metformin preconditioning
was mediated by AMPK-dependent autophagy. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to show that acute
metformin preconditioning confers neuroprotection in rats
with permanent cerebral ischaemia. More importantly,
we demonstrated that AMPK-dependent autophagy was
involved in the underlying protective mechanisms of metformin preconditioning. In addition, our findings support
the hypothesis that pre-activation of autophagy in brain can
protect against fatal cerebral ischaemia (Sheng et al., 2010;
2012). Autophagy facilitates cellular energy production by

degradation of cellular components, and retards endoplasmic
reticulum stress by removing dysfunctional mitochondria
and suppressing local inflammatory responses; so increasing
the tolerance of the brain to a subsequent ischaemic exposure
(Lum et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Sheng et al., 2012; Gao
et al., 2013).
However, our findings appear to contradict those of a
recent study by Li et al. (2010), as they found that acute
preconditioning with metformin worsened the prognosis of
stroke. These opposite results can be explained as follows:
firstly, the dose of metformin used in our study (10 mg kg−1)
was much smaller than that used in the study of Li et al.
(100 mg kg−1), and different doses of metformin may lead to
variations in the degree of activation of AMPK. Moderate
activation of AMPK enhances autophagy as well as astrocytic
glycolysis and ketosis to provide energy to neurons in the
subsequent ischaemic exposure (Blazquez et al., 1999).
However, overactivation of AMPK by a large dose of metformin may lead to prolonged astrocytic glycolysis, which
results in a progressive acidosis and inhibits the ability of
neurons to use lactate as an energy source, thus contributing
to neuronal death (Pellerin and Magistretti, 1994). In addition, AMPK overactivation might result in excessive
autophagy, which is also detrimental to neuronal survival
(Wen et al., 2008). Secondly, we employed a permanent
ischaemic model whereas Li et al. utilized an ischaemia/
reperfusion model to investigate the effects of metformin on
stroke. The pathophysiology mechanisms underlying these
two ischaemic models are quite different, which may account
for these opposite findings (Mao et al., 1999).
Lastly, some minor issues should be mentioned here.
Firstly, the neuroprotection of metformin preconditioning
could be fully inhibited by Compound C while inhibition of
autophagy by 3-MA only partly abolished the metformininduced neuroprotection. This interesting observation
implies that, in addition to inducing autophagy, metformin
preconditioning might confer neuroprotection through other
AMPK-dependent mechanisms; these need to be identified in
future studies. Secondly, it is noteworthy that in our study
the rodents used were relatively young (12–14 weeks old),
whereas ischaemic stroke occurs mainly in the elderly and the
responsiveness of AMPK to metformin was revealed to drop
sharply with aging (Mennes et al., 2013). Hence, the efficacy

BJP

of metformin preconditioning on stroke prevention in aged
rodents needs to be validated in the future. Thirdly, oral
administration of metformin is a more practical and less
invasive route, but this might exhibit a different doseresponse curve when compared with i.p. injection. Therefore,
future investigations are warranted to determine the efficacy
of oral administration of metformin on the prevention of
stroke.
In summary, our study provides the first evidence that
acute preconditioning with a single dose of metformin
induces autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner in the
brain, which confers neuroprotection against subsequent
focal cerebral ischaemia. These findings reveal the underlying
mechanisms by which metformin administration ameliorates
the effects of ischaemic stroke, and suggest that metformin
may have a practical clinical use for stroke prevention in
addition to its hypoglycaemic effects.
