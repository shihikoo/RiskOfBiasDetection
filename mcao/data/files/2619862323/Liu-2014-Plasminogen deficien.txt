Abstract
Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been implicated in neurite outgrowth and neurological recovery post stroke. tPA
converts the zymogen plasminogen (Plg) into plasmin. In this study, using plasminogen knockout (Plg-/-) mice and their Plgnative littermates (Plg+/+), we investigated the role of Plg in axonal remodeling and neurological recovery after stroke. Plg+/+
and Plg-/- mice (n = 10/group) were subjected to permanent intraluminal monofilament middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAo). A foot-fault test and a single pellet reaching test were performed prior to and on day 3 after stroke, and weekly
thereafter to monitor functional deficit and recovery. Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected into the left motor
cortex to anterogradely label the corticospinal tract (CST). Animals were euthanized 4 weeks after stroke. Neurite outgrowth
was also measured in primary cultured cortical neurons harvested from Plg+/+ and Plg-/- embryos. In Plg+/+ mice, the motor
functional deficiency after stroke progressively recovered with time. In contrast, recovery in Plg-/- mice was significantly
impaired compared to Plg+/+ mice (p,0.01). BDA-positive axonal density of the CST originating from the contralesional
cortex in the denervated side of the cervical gray matter was significantly reduced in Plg-/- mice compared with Plg+/+ mice
(p,0.05). The behavioral outcome was highly correlated with the midline-crossing CST axonal density (R2.0.82, p,0.01).
Plg-/- neurons exhibited significantly reduced neurite outgrowth. Our data suggest that plasminogen-dependent proteolysis
has a beneficial effect during neurological recovery after stroke, at least in part, by promoting axonal remodeling in the
denervated spinal cord.

neuroendocrine tissue synthesized PA/Plg is widely distributed in
the hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and
cortex [8,9], and is involved in axonal outgrowth and pathfinding
[10,11], synaptic plasticity [12], dendritic remodeling [13], and
long term potentiation including learning and memory [7]. tPA
has both proteolytic and non-proteolytic effects in the central
nervous system (CNS). However, whether the tPA/plasmin system
contributes to neurological recovery during the late phase after
stroke, has not been explicitly investigated. To test whether the
neurorestorative effects of tPA directly depend on the proteolytic
action of tPA on plasminogen, we compared the behavioral
outcome and CST axonal remodeling between Plg-deficient
(Plg-/-) and Plg-native (Plg+/+) control mice subjected to middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), and the status of neurite
outgrowth primary cultured cortical neurons harvested from
embryonic Plg+/+ and Plg-/- mice.

Introduction
One of the most common impairments after stroke is
hemiparesis of the contralateral body side to the affected cerebral
hemisphere. As hemiparesis after stroke is a consequence of
interruption of motor signals from the motor cortex to the spinal
motoneurons, reestablishment of the corticospinal innervation
provides a physical substrate for functional recovery. Our prior
studies have demonstrated that axonal remodeling of the
corticospinal tract (CST) contributes to neurological recovery
after stroke in rodents [1]. In addition, bone marrow stromal cells
(MSCs) significantly enhanced CST axonal outgrowth in the
denervated spinal cord, and thereby improved motor functional
recovery of the stroke-impaired forelimb [2]. Recent in vitro and
in vivo data suggest that endogenous tPA mediates MSC induced
neurite outgrowth and functional recovery after stroke [3–5].
Subacute (7 day post stroke) intranasal tPA delivery into the rodent
brain also promoted CST axonal remodeling and behavioral
outcome after stroke [6].
tPA was originally identified as a serine protease that catalyzes
the conversion of the zymogen plasminogen (Plg) into the active
plasmin [7]. In addition to its well established role in intravascular
thrombolysis in the circulation system of the hepatic derived Plg,

Animal stroke model
Plg-/- mice, B6.129P2-Plgtm1Jld/J [14], and wild-type (WT)

generation). The Plg+/– mice were intercrossed and their F2
offspring genotyped by Southern blot analysis of tail-tip DNA.
Male Plg2/2 mice and their corresponding Plg+/+ littermates at 810 weeks of age were subjected to permanent right intraluminal
monofilament MCAo [15]. Plg2/2 mice exhibiting rectal prolapse
before or during the experiments were excluded. Within the first
week after surgery, five mice died out of the 25 subjected to MCAo
(2 in Plg+/+ group and 3 in Plg2/2 group). All experiments were
conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Henry Ford
Hospital (Permit Number: 1048). All surgery was performed under
isoflurane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize
suffering.

in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Gibco, Grand
Island, NY) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco). The
cells were incubated at 37uC with 5% CO2 for 24 hours, and then
transferred to Neurobasal medium (Gibco) containing 2% B-27
(Gibco) and 5% FBS.
The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after 1 to 5
days in culture, respectively. The cells were incubated with
monoclonal rabbit antibody against neuronal class III beta tubulin
(Tuj1, 1:1000; Covance, Princeton, NJ) and stained with Cy3conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno Research, West
Grove, PA) to identify neurons. TuJ1-positive cells were digitized
using a 20x objective (Zeiss) via the MicroComputer Imaging
Device (MCID) analysis system (Imaging Research, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada), and analyzed using MCID software for
percentage of neurite positive neurons, branch number and
neurite length on 100 neurons distributed in 9 random fields per
well with three wells per group.

Behavioral measurements
The neurological functional deficits and recovery after stroke
were monitored with a series of tests, i.e. foot-fault test [16] to
assess the accuracy of left forepaw placement on a non-equidistant
grid by the percentage of foot faults of the left forepaw to total
steps, and single-pellet reaching test [17] to assess skilled reaching
ability of the stroke-impaired left forepaw by success rate (%) =
(number of pellets extracted/number of left forepaw attempts)
x100. The tests were performed at 1 day prior to MCAo, and at 3,
7 days after stroke and weekly thereafter.

Statistical analysis
The sample size (10 per group) and power of 80% were
identified at the time of designing the experiments. The effect size
was determined based on our many years of laboratory experience
in stroke research. With 10 animals per group and 2 groups, we
were able to detect an effect size of 1.325 using two sample t-test
and considering an alpha = 0.05 and two-sided tests. All measurements were performed by experimenters blinded to each
condition. Results are expressed as the mean 6 SD. Significance
of difference between animal groups was determined by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test or
unpaired Student’s t-test. A value of P,0.05 was considered
significant. To test the correlation between behavioral outcome
and CST axonal remodeling, the correlation coefficients between
the left forepaw motor performance and the axonal density in the
denervated side of the cervical cord were calculated by Pearson’s
correlation coefficients.

Anterograde CST tracing
Fourteen days after MCAo, a unilateral craniotomy was
performed over the left frontal motor cortex with a high speed
drill. Ten % solution of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA,
10000 MW; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in saline was injected
through a finely drawn glass capillary into 4 points in the left
frontal motor cortex of forelimb motor area (100 nl per injection
site; stereotaxic coordinates: 0 and 0.5 mm rostral to the bregma,
1.5 and 2.0 mm lateral to the midline, 0.7 mm deep from the
cortical surface) [18] to anterogradely label the CST axons
originating from the pyramidal neurons in these areas.

Tissue preparation and data analysis

Lesion volume was not altered in Plg deficient mice after
MCAo

Mice were perfused transcardialy with saline, followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde at 28 days after MCAo (n = 10/group). The
brain was cut into 7 equally spaced (1 mm) coronal blocks and
embedded in paraffin, then sectioned for lesion volume measurement with hematoxylin and eosin staining. The cervical spinal
cord segments of C4-7 were processed for vibratome traverse
section (75 mm). Sections were incubated with primary antibody
against biotin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) for 3 days,
and Cy-3 conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz) overnight
at 4uC. The sections were digitized with a laser-scanning confocal
imaging system mounted onto a Zeiss microscope (Bio-Rad,
Cambridge, MA). For each animal, the total length of midlinecrossing axons in the denervated side of the ventral gray matter
was measured on 10 z-axis image stacks with an ImageJ software
plugin, NeuriteTracer.

In both Plg+/+ and Plg-/- mice subjected to permanent
intraluminal monofilament MCAo, a large lesion area was
observed in the cerebral cortex, corpus callosum, striatum, basal
ganglia and thalamus at 28 days after stroke (Figure 1A). As
quantitated as the percentage of the contralesional hemisphere,
the infarction volumes were 21.364.1% (Range 16.1 to 27.4%) in
Plg+/+ mice, and 23.064.4% (Range 14.7 to 28.6%) in Plg-/- mice,
respectively (B). There was no significant difference between
groups.

Motor functional recovery after stroke was reduced in Plg
deficient mice
To measure the deficit and recovery of non-skilled and skilled
motor performance of the stroke-impaired left forepaw, foot-fault
test and single pellet reaching test were performed before and day
3 post stroke, and weekly thereafter. As shown in Figure 2, severe,
however, comparable motor deficits were evident in both Plg+/+
and Plg-/- mice after MCAo. The functional deficits gradually
recovered with time; however, the recovery in Plg-/- mice was
significantly worse than in Plg+/+ mice post-stroke, assessed in both
foot-fault test (A, p,0.01 at day 21 and p,0.001 at day 28) and
single pellet reaching test (B, p,0.01 at day 21 and 28).

Primary culture of embryonic cortical neurons
Cortical neurons were harvested from pregnant female Plg+/2
mice at embryonic day 17–18. Briefly, under deep Ketamine
anesthesia, embryos were removed and genotyped individually.
The cerebral cortices of Plg-/- and Plg+/+ embryos were dissociated
in Ca2+ and Mg2+ free Hanks balance salt solution containing
0.125% trypsin digestion for 30 minutes. After filtered with cell
strainers (BD Falcon REF 352350), the cells were seeded onto
poly-D-lysine coated 6-well plates at a density of 56104 cells/well

of BDA-labeled CST axons in the stroke-impaired side was
significantly reduced in Plg-/- mice (D, p,0.01).

CST axonal remodeling highly correlates with behavioral
outcome after stroke
To test whether contralesional CST axonal remodeling
functionally contributes to neurological outcome after stroke, we
examined the correlation of behavioral outcome with the midlinecrossing CST axonal density in the denervated side of the cervical
cord 28 days after MCAo. The data indicated that the motor
performance of the stroke-impaired forelimb assessed with the
foot-fault test and the single pellet reaching test were highly
correlated with CST axons originating from the contralesional
cortex (Figure 4A and B, R2.0.82, p,0.01).

Plg deficient cultured cortical neurons exhibit reduced
neurite outgrowth
To verify whether Plg deficiency alters the ability of neurite
outgrowth, we compared primary cultured cortical neurons
harvested from both Plg+/+ and Plg-/- embryos (Figure 5). The
neurons were identified with fluorescent immunostaining for
neuronal Tuj1 (A). Throughout the culture period of 5 days, we
found that the percentage of neurite positive neurons during day 1
to day 4 (B), and the number of neurite branches (C) and total
length of neurites per neuron (D) were significantly reduced in the
Plg-/- neurons compared with Plg+/+ neurons (p,0.01).

Plg deficient mice exhibit reduced stroke-induced
midline-crossing CST axonal growth into the denervated
side of the cervical cord
Our prior studies demonstrated that unilateral cerebral stroke
induces CST axonal remodeling in the spinal cord, namely, the
CST axons originating from the contralesional cortex cross the
midline of the spinal cord into the denervated side of the gray
matter [19], and the midline-crossing CST axons contribute to
behavioral recovery after stroke [20]. To characterize the
anatomical basis of reduced motor recovery in mice lacking Plg,
we injected BDA into the forelimb area of the contralesional
cortex, to anterogradely label the CST axons (Figure 3A). In Plg+/
+
mice subjected to MCAo, in the denervated side of the cervical
cord, BDA-labeled CST axons crossed the midline of the spinal
cord, and extended toward ventral horn (B). In contrast, BDAlabeled CST axons were rarely observed in the denervated spinal
cord in Plg-/- mice (C). Quantitative data showed that the density

Discussion
In this study, to directly examine the importance of plasminogen
in stroke onset and recovery, we investigated the differences of
behavioral outcome and contralesional axonal remodeling of the
CST in young adult Plg-/- and genetically matched Plg+/+ mice
subjected to MCAo, and neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons
harvested from both Plg+/+ and Plg-/- embryos. In mice lacking
Plg, there are no obvious phenotypic abnormalities observed in the
majority of animals up to 21 weeks of the age, except for

percentage of foot-faults of the left forepaw to total steps. B: The single pellet reaching test measures the ability of skilled forepaw use. Animals were
trained to use their left forepaw to extract food pellets through a vertical slot of the front wall. The number of the left forepaw extensions through
the slot and the number of pellets extracted were counted. Performance was defined by the success rate as the percentage of pellet number
extracted per left forepaw attempts. After stroke, significant behavioral deficits were evident in both tests. The Plg+/+ mice showed a progressive
improvement with time, while the Plg-/- mice exhibited a significant delayed recovery compared with the Plg+/+ mice (n = 10/group, *p,0.01, **p,
0.001).

the permanent intraluminal MCAo model, significantly affect the
infarct volume. In addition, tPA induces neuronal excitotoxicity
through binding to and cleavage of the NR1 subunit of the Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptors [23]; however, the neurotoxic role of
tPA in ischemic tissues remains uncertain. An early study showed
that transient ischemia/reperfusion in SV129 background tPAdeficient mice exhibited approximately 50% smaller cerebral
infarcts than in C57BL/6 wild-type mice [24]. In contrast, a
similar study showed that the infarct volume in tPA-/- mice was
larger than background matched tPA+/+ mice, however, infarct
volume was much smaller than in C57BL/6 mice [25]. Our results
of comparable infarct volume in background matched Plg-/- and
Plg+/+ mice suggest that the proteolytic function of plasmin may
not be directly involved in the potential neurotoxicity of tPA
during the evolution of the ischemic infarct.
Patients with Plg deficiency exhibit symmetric internal hydrocephalus with a Dandy-Walker malformation, hypoplasia of the
cerebellum, and a hypoplastic corpus callosum [26], indicating an
important role of the Plg activation system in neuronal development. In both behavioral tests employed to estimate the
neurological outcome of the left forepaw in mice subjected to right
MCAo, the mice need to voluntarily control the paw movement. In
the foot-fault test, when mice walk on the non-equidistant grids,

inflammatory rectal lesions and rectal prolapse found in some
animals [14]. Our data indicate that mice lacking Plg showed
reduced neurological recovery and corticospinal motor axonal
outgrowth in the denervated spinal gray matter. Additionally,
primary cultured cortical neurons harvested from the Plg-/- mice
showed decreased neurite outgrowth compared to cortical neurons
from Plg+/+ mice.
The PA/Plg system, in addition to fibrinolyis, plays a key role in
the development of the nervous system [21] and possibly in
mediating neuronal plasticity post stroke. In the current study, in
mice subjected to permanent intraluminal MCAo, the ischemic
lesion volumes were comparable between Plg+/+ and Plg-/- mice at
day 28 post stroke. In an early study of mice subjected to ligation
of distal MCA, the focal cerebral infarct size at 24 hours after
MCAo was significantly larger in mice with Plg deficiency than
WT mice [22]. Although the reasons for the apparent discrepancy
with the earlier observations on infarct volume need to be further
investigated, they may be related to differences in MCAo surgical
procedures, and the 24 hour time point of sacrifice in the distal
MCA ligation study, which may have been too early to identify a
mature ischemic infarct. Our consistent observations on the
comparable severity of behavioral deficit at the early phase, i.e.,
day 3 after stroke, suggests that Plg deficiency may not, at least in

originating from the contralesional forelimb motor area with
intracortical injection of anterograde neuronal tracer, BDA. Our
previous study demonstrated that stroke induced interhemispheric
axonal remodeling in the spinal cord [19]. The present data
showed in the stroke-impaired side of the spinal gray matter, that
midline-crossing CST axonal outgrowth was significantly reduced
in Plg-/- mice compared to their genetic background matched
Plg+/+ mice. Interestingly, Plg activation is increased at the crush
site of the sciatic nerve accompanying peripheral nerve regeneration [31], and Plg-/- mice show delayed functional recovery after
sciatic nerve crush [32], suggesting Plg may contribute to axonal
regeneration in a common way in both the CNS and peripheral
nervous system. In the present study, we primarily focused on the
axonal remodeling of the direct motor pathway, the CST.
However, the rubrospinal tract participates in the coordination
of movements across joints, such as skilled forelimb movements
[33], locomotion [34] and motor responses to pain [35], and
possesses very similar branching patterns with the CST in the
spinal cord [36]. The cortico-rubrospinal pathway appears to be a
backup to the CST to enhance the behavioral recovery after CST
lesion [37]. We and others have demonstrated that axonal
plasticity of the corticorubral tract [38–40] and other spinal
descending pathways [41] contribute to functional recovery after
stroke in rodents. Further investigations on these alternate
pathways to reveal the detailed anatomical substrates for tPA/
Plg mediated axonal remodeling and neurological recovery after
stroke are warranted.

each step requires adjustment in stride length and distribution of
body weight, to place the limb appropriately on the rung and then
to grasp it [27]. For the skilled reaching task, mice advance the
forelimb aimed to the pellet, pronate the paw on it, grasp it, extract
it and release the food into the mouth [17]. Our behavioral data
showing no differences in motor performance between Plg+/+ and
Plg-/- mice before MCAo are in agreement with the observation that
Plg deficiency does not alter neuromotor ability, motor coordination, locomotor activity, reaction to gravitational positioning,
integration of motor and vestibular systems during postnatal
development [21]. The observations of comparable infarct volume
and severity of behavioral deficit at day 3 after stroke between Plg+/+
and Plg-/- mice suggest the delayed recovery in Plg deficient mice is
not attributed to differences in acute injury. Furthermore, the
behavioral outcome was highly correlated with CST axonal
remodeling in the denervated side of the spinal cord after stroke.
Therefore, we suggest that the reduced behavioral recovery in Plg-/mice during the late phase (3 to 4 weeks) after stroke may be
attributed to reduced neurological plasticity.
Unilateral stroke affects both sides of the brain. In neuroimaging
studies of stroke patients, co-activation appears in bilateral motor
areas when moving the affected limb [28]. Furthermore, the
contralesional motor system may contribute to compensatory
recovery of the affected forelimb [29]. Growth factors do not
further increase axonal sprouting in the injured hemisphere, but
promote lesion-remote plasticity of the contralesional pyramidal
tract [30]. To investigate the neuroanatomical basis of the reduced
motor functional recovery in Plg-/- mice, we traced the CST axons

Axon Remodeling and Function Recovery after Stroke

In primary cultured embryonic cortical neurons, we found that
Plg deficiency significantly reduced neuritogenesis, and neurite
sprouting and outgrowth. tPA is primarily produced by neurons
and microglia, whereas plasminogen is exclusively expressed by
neurons [42]. Previous studies suggested that non-proteolytic
effects of tPA derived from microglia may indirectly affect
hippocampal mossy fiber pathfinding and outgrowth [43], while
the neuron derived tPA/plasmin proteolytic system facilitates
continued neurite extension via degradation of the extracellular
matrix proteoglycans and cell surface components [44]. In
addition, it has been demonstrated that cleavage of the precursor
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into the mature BDNF
by the extracellular protease plasmin is essential for long term
hippocampal plasticity [45]. The tPA–plasmin cascade has also
been implicated in cleavage of the precursor nerve growth factor
(NGF) to mature NGF [46,47]. Furthermore, Plg gene expression
is regulated by NGF [48], and is required in NGF induced
neuritogenesis [49] and neurite outgrowth [48]. Blockade of the
proteolytic activity of plasmin delayed NGF-dependent neuritogenesis and neurite outgrowth [49]. Therefore, we suggest that the
reduced neurological recovery after stroke in Plg deficient mice
may be attributed to direct participation of plasmin proteolysis in

neuritogenesis and neurite outgrowth. However, in the present
study, we did not investigate the effects of tPA/Plg on dendrites,
which may be regulated by different mechanisms during
development and plasticity [50,51]. Further studies to specifically
investigate the distinct effects of tPA/Plg on axonal and dendritic
outgrowth and plasticity are warranted.

Conclusions
Taken together, the present observations of reduced behavioral
outcome and axonal remodeling in Plg deficient mice demonstrate
that the endogenous Plg-dependent proteolysis is an important
element involved in neurological recovery after stroke, suggesting
that, in addition to being used as a thrombolytic agent in the
circulation system, tPA/plasmin in the CNS parenchyma is
neurorestorative, and provides therapeutic benefit by enhancing
neuronal remodeling during the convalescence after stroke.
