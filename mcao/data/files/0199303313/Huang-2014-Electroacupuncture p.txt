Abstract. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
electroacupuncture (EA) on cell proliferation and its molecular
mechanisms. Sixty rats were randomly divided into 5 groups:
sham operation control (SC), ischemia control (IC), EA, EA and
DMSO injection (ED), EA and U0126 injection (EU). All the
groups, with the exception of SC, underwent middle cerebral
artery occlusion (MCAO), and DMSO or U0126 was injected
into the rat in the ED or EU group 30 min prior to MCAO.
Cell proliferation was evaluated by proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) immunostaining. The changes of cell cycle
proteins (cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, CDK2, p21 and p27) and
the ERK1/2 pathway activation were examined by RT-PCR and
western blot analysis. The results showed that the positive cell
numbers of PCNA immunostaining in the EA and ED groups
were more than those in the IC group (P<0.05). The mRNA and
protein levels of p21 or p27 were obviously increased, however,
the mRNA and protein levels of cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E and
CDK2 were reduced in the IC and EU groups. The findings
suggested that EA activates the ERK1/2 signaling pathway to
protect brain injury during cerebral ischemia. However, this
positive effect of EA can be blocked by U0126.
Introduction
Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke, accounting
for 60-80% of all types of strokes (1). In an ischemic stroke,
impairment of cerebral circulation causes hypoxia and ischemia, leading to localized ischemic necrosis or softening of

brain tissue, as manifested by localized or diffuse loss of brain
function. Restoring blood supply to ischemic brain tissue is the
primary treatment for ischemic stroke and is performed via two
main methods: non-drug therapy (e.g., extracranial - intracranial arterial anastomosis) and drug therapy (e.g., thrombolytic
therapy). However, in recent years clinicians have found that in
some patients with ischemic stroke, restoring blood supply to
the brain tissue aggravates the symptoms instead of relieving
them. Other studies have shown that the main pathological
factors that contribute to such reperfusion injuries include an
increased number of free radicals, calcium overload, excitatory
amino acid toxicity and excessive apoptosis of neural cells (2,3).
After the occurrence of acute brain ischemia, a penumbra
zone develops around the lesion area. The metabolism and
function of neurons in this zone are inhibited. If intervention
can reverse such inhibition and activate these neurons, normal
function can be restored. Animal studies have shown that 24 h
after the occurrence of brain ischemia, neuronal axon initiation is triggered. The axons continue to grow and remodel over
the next 14 days and reach maturity on day 28. Intervention
that is provided during neuronal axon initiation may be conducive to recovery of neurological functions (4,5). In China,
electro­acupuncture is used to treat various diseases, including
symptoms of stroke dysfunction. In western countries, the role
of electroacupuncture has also been gradually recognized
and promoted.
In the central nervous system of adult mammals, there
are two types of special neuron clusters: the subependymal
zone of the lateral ventricle and the subgranular zone of the
hippocampal dentate gyrus. Under certain conditions, neurons
in these zones are capable of proliferating (6). However, the
amount of endogenous neural cell proliferation is limited and is
not sufficient to counteract the brain damage induced by cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion (I/R). Therefore, identifying drugs
or measures that can stimulate endogenous neural stem cell
prolife­ration and differentiation is of great importance.
The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)
signaling pathway belongs to the family of mitogen-activated
protein kinase signal transduction pathways. An abnormality
in the ERK1/2 signaling pathway is closely associated with the
occurrence and development of I/R injury. In neurons affected
by ischemic stroke, various mechanisms lead to excessive

activation of ERK, which then promotes cell proliferation,
inhibits apoptosis, promotes cell invasion and affects cell
differentiation.
In the present study, U0126, a highly selective ERK1/2
pathway inhibitor, was injected in an ischemic-reperfusion rat
model and the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective function of electro­acupuncture at acupoints of Zusanli (ST36) and
Quchi (LI11), was explored. The results indicated that improvement in the neurological function of ischemic-reperfusion rats,
as a result of electroacupuncture, is closely associated with the
ERK1/2 pathway.

skin was prepared and the surgical area disinfected via a strict
protocol. Rats were then fixed in a stereotaxis and a skin incision was made along the parietal midline, exposing the anterior
fontanelle, which was then marked. The lateral ventricle was
precisely located (9) using the stereotaxis, at 2 mm lateral to
and 1 mm below, the anterior fontanelle on the left side. Using
the stereotaxis as a guide, a hole was drilled in the skull at
this localized point and a needle attached to a micro-syringe
was vertically inserted into the cerebral cortex to a depth of
~3.5 mm beneath the surface. After confirmation that the
needle tip was inside the ventricle, the syringe pump was turned
on and the drug was slowly injected. Three min after completion of the injection, the micro-syringe was slowly retracted
(the duration of needle retraction was ≥3 min) and the skin was
sutured. Drug administration was carried out 30 min prior to
model establishment (7).

(1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene)
(Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA).
Instruments. Instruments used in this study included the

ST-53311 syringe pump (Stoelting Corp., Wood Dale, IL, USA),
and 50 µl flat head micro-syringe (Hamilton Corp., Bonaduz,
Switzerland).
Animal grouping. A total of 60 healthy, SPF grade, male,
Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, weighing 250±30 g and aged
2.21±0.15 months, were purchased from the Shanghai
SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. [license number: SCXX
(Shanghai) 2007-0005]. A random number table was used to
divide the 60 rats into five groups of 12 rats each: the sham
control group (SC), middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
ischemic model control group (IC), MCAO + electroacupuncture group (EA), MCAO + electroacupuncture + DMSO group
(ED) and MCAO + electroacupuncture + DMSO + U0126
group (EU). There was no significant difference in the weight
or age of rats between the groups (P>0.05, Table I).
Inhibitor and solvent administration. The U0126 inhibitor
was diluted to 10 µM and injected into the left ventricle of the
rat stereotaxically (7). The dose used was based on relevant
literature (8). Specifically, DMSO was used to dilute the U0126
inhibitor to 10 µM and 5 µl of the diluted U0126 inhibitor was
loaded into the micro-syringe. Rats were anesthetized with
10% chloral hydrate (3 ml/kg i.p.) after which, the parietal

MCAO model. The animals were preoperatively fasted for 12 h.
Rats were weighed and anesthetized with an i.p. injection of
3 ml/kg chloral hydrate. Longa's suture-occluded method (10)
was used to establish the MCAO and reperfusion model: in
rats, the left middle cerebral artery area was selected as the
infarction region and the detailed steps that were used are the
same as those described in previous studies (11). Reperfusion
was performed 2 h after occlusion and the suture was gently
retracted to the carotid artery bifurcation. Intraoperative and
postoperative room temperature was maintained at ~25˚C.
Incandescent light was used to keep the animal warm in order
to maintain rectal temperature at 37±1˚C until recovery as
evidenced by resumption of normal activity. In the SC group,
the artery was isolated, but not tied with suture. After surgery
and recovery, the animals were placed in an environment at
room temperature (25˚C) and resumed a normal diet.
Electroacupuncture intervention. Preparation for the electro­
acupuncture intervention involved the following: a) SC group:
the animals were returned to the cage following the surgery and
maintained, with no treatment being provided. b) IC group: the
animals were returned to the cage after model establishment and
maintained, with no treatment being provided. c) EA group: on
the diseased side, Zusanli and Quchi acupoints were localized
using the method described in ‘experimental acupuncture’ (12).
A electroacupuncture instrument (G6805; Shanghai Huayi Co.,
Shanghai, China; peak voltage = 6 V, dilatational wave, frequency
1-20 Hz) was used and adjusted in order that the limbs were
gently shaking. Each electroacupuncture session lasted 30 min
and was carried out once a day, beginning the day after surgery
and ending on the third day when the animals were euthanized.

Animal sample collection. Animals in different groups were
anesthetized, the abdominal aorta clamped and perfusion
was performed through the left ventricle with 0.9% saline,
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered
saline for fixation. The skull was opened and the brain was
quickly removed and placed on ice. The whole brain tissue
was placed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered
saline, frozen and stored at 4˚C. The tissues were embedded in
paraffin for immuno­histochemical testing. For TTC staining,
animals in different groups were anesthetized, the abdominal
aorta clamped and perfusion was performed through the left
ventricle with 0.9% saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde
in phosphate‑buffered saline for fixation. The skull was opened
and the brain was quickly removed and placed on ice. Whole
brain tissue was placed in a -80˚C freezer. For western blotting
and PCR, animals in different groups were anesthetized, the
skull opened and the brain quickly removed and placed on
ice. Cortical tissues from the left side were collected, using
a scalpel, placed in Eppendorf PCR (EP) tubes and stored in
liquid nitrogen for subsequent use.

Western blotting. A 200-mg sample of cortical tissue was
collected from the left side of the brain. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and membrane transfer were performed, the polyvinylidene
fluoride membrane was removed, and then blocked with 5%
skim milk for 2 h. Anti-ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, cyclin D, CDK4,
cyclin E, CDK2, PCNA, p21 or p27 antibody was then added
and the polyvinylidene fluoride was incubated at 4˚C overnight.
A corresponding secondary antibody (1:5,000) was then added
and a computer scan was performed and the data stored for
subsequent analysis.

Neurological severity score. The five-point scoring system
developed by Longa et al (10) and Bederson et al (13) was used
to assess the neurological severity of the model animals. The
evaluation was performed 2 h after reperfusion and on days 1-3
immediately prior to electroacupuncture intervention. Neural
damage in model rats that manifested 2 h after the establishment of infarction was scored on a scale of 0-4 points with a
score of 1-3 points suggesting that the model was successful.
Specifically the scores were: 0 points, no neurological deficit;
1 point, the tail was lifted and adduction (not able to fully
extend) of the right forelimb was observed; 2 points, spontaneous circling to the right when walking; 3 points, the body
was slanted to the right when walking; 4 points, not able to
walk spontaneously along with possible loss of consciousness.

Statistical analysis. SPSS 16.0 was used for statistical analysis.
Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. For multiple
comparisons of quantitative data, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used. If the data satisfied homogeneity of variance, the Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) method
was applied, otherwise Tamhane's method was applied. P<0.05
was considered statistically significant.

TTC staining. Fresh brain tissue was placed in -80˚C freezer
for 20 min, and sections were cut to a thickness of ~2 mm,
along the coronal plane, starting ~2 mm away from the end
of the frontal lobe. Each brain sample was cut into 5-6 slices,
which were placed in TTC, covered with aluminum foil and
placed in an incubator at 37˚C for 15-30  min. The brain
slices were turned frequently to achieve uniform staining.
Following staining, the infarction region was stained white,
whereas the other regions were stained red. The stained brain
slices were placed on a scale, and images were captured. The
Image‑ProPlus image analysis and processing system were
used to calculate the total volume of infarcted brain tissue in
each sample. This volume was then divided by the total brain
volume to obtain the percentage of brain infarction for subsequent statistical analysis.
Immunohistochemistry. The tissue was subjected to routine
paraffin-embedded sectioning and antigen retrieval, then
rinsed with buffer. Anti-PCNA primary antibody was then
added in drops, as described in previous studies (11,14).
Under a x400 light microscope (Leica DM2500M; Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) five non-overlapping fields
were randomly selected and the number of positively stained
cells was counted using automation.

Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. RT-PCR was performed
to determine mRNA expression levels of cyclin D, CDK4,
cyclin E, CDK2, PCNA, p21 and p27 in the cortical tissues
of left brain of rat. RNA extraction and PCR products were
obtained as described in previous studies (11,12). Then, 8 µl
of the PCR product was subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Image analysis software was used to analyze the
electrophoretic bands, and the integrated density value (IDV)
of each band was obtained.

Results
Neurological assessment and brain tissue morphology of MCAO
rats following electroacupuncture treatment. Assessment of the
neurological behavior of rats showed no significant difference
between the IC and EU groups at 2 h, 1-3 days after the reperfusion (P>0.05). In the EA and ED groups, as disease progressed
and the electroacupuncture intervention proceeded, the neurological scores gradually decreased. The score 2 days after
reperfusion was lower compared with 2 h (P>0.05) and 1 day
(P<0.05). The score was lowest 3 days following reperfusion
(P<0.05). No significant differences were observed between
any of the groups at 2 h and 1 day after reperfusion (P>0.05).
No significant differences were identified between the IC and
EU groups or between the EA and ED groups (P>0.05) at 2 h
and 2 days after reperfusion. The neurological scores of the
EA and ED groups were significantly lower compared to the
IC group (P<0.05). However, the neurological score of the EU
group was higher compared to the EA and ED groups (P>0.05)
likely due to the effect of U0126 (Table II).
For the morphological and histological analyses, brain
slices of MCAO model rats were subjected to TTC staining
and examined. The IC group exhibited the largest volume of
cerebral infarction (28.67±5.79, n=3). The volume of cerebral
infarction was significantly smaller in the EA (13.60±1.71, n=3)
and ED (14.74±1.04, n=3) groups compared with the IC group
(P=0.001). The cerebral infarction volume was also smaller
in the EU (23.69±3.04, n=3) compared with the IC group,
however the difference was not significant (P=0.113). Similarly,
there was no significant difference in cerebral infarction
volume when comparing the EA and ED groups (P=0.695).

(p-ERK1/2), blocked by U0126. Total protein levels of ERK1/2 (t-ERK1/2)
were not affected by I/R or EA treatment. β-actin was used as the internal
control.

Neurological score and the TTC staining results suggest that
electroacupuncture intervention treatment is effective and that
adding inhibitors can reduce treatment efficacy (Fig. 1).
PCNA expression in cerebral ischemia and reperfusion
model rats. In immunohistochemical testing, PCNA-positive
substances that are located in the nuclei are brown in color and
serve as a good indicator of the state of cell proliferation. The
number of PCNA‑positive cells was reduced in the IC, EA,
ED and EU groups (Fig. 2A). However, the number of PCNA
positive cells was significantly higher in both the EA and
ED groups compared with the IC group. No significant difference was observed in the number of PCNA‑positive cells in the
IC vs. EU group (Fig. 2B). To validate these results, RT-PCR
was performed to evaluate PCNA expression. Results obtained
by measuring PCNA mRNA expression showed the same trend
as that determined using immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2C).
This observation suggests that cell proliferation occurs after
electroacupuncture in the infarction region of the rat cortex.
Electroacupuncture and p-ERK1/2 expression in cerebral
ischemia and reperfusion model rats. As shown in Fig. 3,

t-ERK1/2 was not notably different among different groups.
By contrast, p-ERK1/2 expression in the EA and ED groups
was notably increased compared to the SC group, whereas
p-ERK1/2 expression in the IC group was decreased compared
to the SC group. p-ERK1/2 protein expression in the EU group
was lower compared to the SC group due to the effect of
U0126. These results suggested that in cerebral ischemia and
reperfusion model rats, U0126 is able to block activation of
the ERK1/2 signaling pathway induced by electroacupuncture,
whereas DMSO does not have any notable effects on brain
damage.
Analyses on growth factors promoting cell proliferation. As
shown in Fig. 4, the mRNA, or transcription levels of cyclin D,
CDK4, cyclin E, and CDK2 were notably higher in the EA and
ED groups, and lower in the EU group, compared to the IC
group. Protein expression levels of cyclin D, CDK4, cyclin E
and CDK2 were consistent with the mRNA results. The mRNA
and protein expression of the cyclin kinase inhibitors p21 and
p27 was notably inhibited in the EA and ED groups, and notably
increased in the EU group, compared to the IC group. This result
suggested that, after electroacupuncture intervention, p21 and

p27 expression is downregulated, although this effect can be
reversed by U0126.
Discussion
Ischemic stroke belongs to the ‘stroke’ category in traditional
Chinese medicine. According to the theory of traditional
Chinese medicine, the basic mechanism of ischemic stroke is
loss of ying and yang balance, as well as disruption of Qi and
blood flow. Ancient Chinese physicians believed that paralysis
should be treated ‘through Yangming meridians’. Zusanli and
Quchi are both in the Yangming meridians. Most Yangming
meridians are full of Qi and blood flow; if Qi and blood flow
are smooth in Yangming meridians, the whole meridian system
is clear and this allows the body to recover. The primary lesion
area in a stroke is the head. Quchi belongs to the hand Yangming
meridian, and Zusanli belongs to the foot Yangming meridian.
The hand and foot Yangming meridians pass through the head
and the Qi in these two meridians can act together to treat stroke.
Previous studies (11,14) on a large amount of ancient Chinese
medical literature conducted by our group have shown that
Zusanli and Quchi are the two acupoints that have been used
relatively frequently for stroke treatment. In rats with cerebral
ischemia and reperfusion, electroacupuncture at Zusanli and
Quchi was found to significantly increase β-EP and Glu expression levels in the hypothalamus, reduce the total calcium level
and free radicals in the brain tissue and inhibit excitatory amino
acid toxicity (15). Functional magnetic resonance imaging has
also confirmed that acupuncture at Zusanli activates most brain
regions, mainly the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, island lobe,
parietal lobe, cingulate gyrus and cerebellum, and that temporal
lobe activation was found to be the most substantial (16,17). The
results of the present study have demonstrated that the volume of
the infarction region in the EA group was significantly smaller
than that in the IC group (P<0.05). This finding suggests that
electroacupuncture can reduce the infarct volume in cerebral
I/R rats, which is consistent with results of a previous study
conducted by our group (11).
Neurological severity scores may be used to predict the
histological effects in cerebral ischemia and reperfusion model
rats (18). The results of the present study show that on the third
day after reperfusion the neurological severity score of the
EA group was significantly lower than that of the IC group
(P<0.05). This suggests that 3 days of daily treatment with
electroacupuncture effectively improves neurological function
in rats that have had 2 h of ischemia followed by reperfusion.
A previous study (19) demonstrated that in male, bilateral
artery ischemia gerbils, p-ERK1/2 expression reached a peak
value 5 min after reperfusion, following 3.5 min of ischemia
and that on day 3 after reperfusion the p-ERK1/2 expression
was no longer significantly different compared with the sham
group (P>0.05). This finding suggests that reperfusion activates
the ERK1/2 pathway (19). Since the ERK1/2 pathway appears
to be deactivated by day 3 post-ischemia and reperfusion, we
hypothesized that the neurological improvement observed on
day 3 in the present study was due to activation of the ERK1/2
pathway by electroacupuncture in the EA group.
The ERK1/2 pathway is closely associated with ischemic
stroke. However, whether it plays a protective or damaging role
after ischemic stroke is still under debate (20). A large amount

of evidence has shown that activation of the ERK1/2 pathway
protects brain tissue after ischemic stroke. For instance after
cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury, ERK1/2 can inhibit inflammatory reactions in the brain tissue (21), promote osteopontin
(OPN) secretion, thereby reducing the release of excitatory
amino acids (22), and enhance IL-20 expression, promoting
cell prolife­ration, thus protecting ischemic brain tissue (23).
PD98059 and U0126 are both effective ERK1/2 pathway inhibitors. PD98059 suppresses the activation of mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1, also known as MEK1)
induced by upstream kinases, but is ineffective on MEK1 which
has already been activated and activated MEK1 can still phosphorylate ERK1/2. In comparison, U0126 inhibits MEK1 and
MEK2 highly selectively, whether activated or not, thus effectively suppressing ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Thus, the inhibitory
effect on the ERK1/2 pathway of U0126 is more stable than that
of PD98059 (24). Therefore, in the present study, U0126 was
used as the ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor. The results of the present
study have demonstrated that p-ERK1/2 protein expression in
the EA group was significantly higher than that in the SC and IC
groups, suggesting that 3 days of electroacupuncture intervention
following reperfusion after 2 h of ischemia activates the ERK1/2
pathway. Compared with the EA and ED groups, p-ERK protein
expression in the EU group was significantly decreased, whereas
p-ERK protein expression in the EA and ED groups did not
differ significantly. This finding suggests that U0126 effectively
inhibits ERK1/2 pathway activation and blocks the pathway
activation effect of electro­acupuncture.
The present study has demonstrated that electroacupuncture improved neurological function in I/R rats. In addition,
the ERK1/2 signaling pathway is one of the key pathways that
regulate cell proliferation. We therefore hypothe­sized that
the effect of electroacupuncture may be associated with the
regulation of cell proliferation. PCNA is a good indicator of
cell prolife­ration (25). It can reflect the activity of neural cell
proliferation, thus helping to promote nerve repair after brain
injury (26). In the present study, immunohistochemistry and
RT-PCR were performed to examine PCNA levels and the
results showed that the number of PCNA‑positive cells in the
EA group was significantly higher than that in the IC and EU
groups (P<0.05). This finding suggests that electroacupuncture
increases PCNA expression and promotes cell proliferation,
consistent with a previous finding (11).
Cell proliferation is mainly achieved through progression of
cell cycles and is precisely regulated by three types of factors:
CDKs, cyclins and CKIs. In cell cycles specific CDKs and
specific cyclins bind, form complexes, and connect the signaling
pathway with the cell cycle at the G1/S-phase transition. Studies
have shown that when cells enter the S-phase from the G1-phase,
the phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2 pathway is
crucial to inducing the binding of cyclin D1 and CDK4 and the
binding of cyclin E and CDK2. U0126 inhibits ERK1/2 activation, thus effectively inhibiting the proliferative effect (27-29).
When PD98059 inhibits ERK1/2 signaling pathway activation,
p27Kip1 expression is upregulated, cyclin D1 and E expression
is downregulated and the cells are arrested in the G1-phase (30).
Enhancement of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 expression suppresses
the binding of cyclin E and CDK2 and hampers the progression
of the cell cycle from the G1/G0 to the S-phase (28). The results
of the present study show that electroacupuncture substantially

upregulated the protein and gene expression of cyclin D1,
CDK4, cyclin E and CDK2. Overexpression of these positive
regulatory factors can shorten the G1-phase, cause the G0/S
and/or G1/S transition point to be missed and lead to continued
proliferation. Consistent with this, electroacupuncture intervention significantly reduces the gene and protein expression
of negative regulators p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, thus effectively
preventing their inhibitory effect on positive regulatory factors,
helping to promote cell proliferation. The present study also
shows that DMSO did not have the above effect. However,
despite electroacupuncture intervention, cell proliferation in the
EU group was not found to increase. Instead, a high expression
of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 inhibited the expression of cyclin D1,
CDK4, cyclin E and CDK2 expression, the cell cycle was
arrested in the G1-phase and the cells stopped growing, leading
to inhibition of cell proliferation.
In conclusion, the present study shows that electroacupuncture at Zusanli and Quchi in cerebral I/R rats activates
the ERK1/2 pathway, upregulates positive regulatory factors
PCNA, cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E and CDK2 and downregulates negative regulatory factors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.
This allows rat cortical cells on the ischemic side to pass the
G1-phase and enter the S-phase 3 days after 2 h of ischemia
followed by reperfusion. This promotes neural cell proliferation and plays a protective role in the brain, thereby improving
neurological function in the rats. Taken together, these data
demonstrate that electroacupuncture treatment is an effective
measure for treating ischemic stroke. However, the mechanism
for long-term neuroprotective effects of electroacupuncture at
Zusanli and Quchi should be further investigated.
