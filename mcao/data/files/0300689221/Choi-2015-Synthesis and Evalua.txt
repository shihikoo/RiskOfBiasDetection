Abstract: The physicochemical properties and antioxidant activity of a molecule could be
improved by the substitution of an oxygen atom in a molecule with selenium. We synthesized
selenoflavanones and flavanones to evaluate their neuroprotective effects. The selenoflavanones
showed improved physicochemical properties, suggestive of the ability to pass through the
blood-brain barrier (BBB). They showed in vitro antioxidant effects against hydrogen peroxide, and
did not result in severe cytotoxicity. Moreover, infarction volumes in a transient ischemia mouse
model were significantly reduced by the selenoflavanone treatments.
Keywords: selenoflavanone; flavanone; selenium; neuroprotect; antioxidant; blood-brain barrier (BBB)

1. Introduction
Flavonoids, a group of phenolic compounds with diverse chemical structures and characteristics,
occur naturally in the fruits, seeds, flowers, and bark of plants [1,2]. To date, several studies have
demonstrated the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammation, and anti-cancer activities of flavonoids [3–5].
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, are generated by cerebral ischemia
conditions, such as stroke [6,7]. These ROS induce cell apoptosis, resulting in damage to brain
cells [8–10]. Therefore, an antioxidant compound that scavenges ROS could play an important
role in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. The neuroprotective effects of antioxidants
have been well studied [11,12]. Recently, the flavonoids were highlighted as potentially promising
neuroprotective agents [13–15], but their high polarity limits their ability to penetrate the blood-brain
barrier (BBB).
Our group recently reported that the substitution of an oxygen atom in flavone with selenium
led to improvement in the physicochemical properties and biological activity of molecules [16]. These
selenoflavones had lower polarity (tPSA) and higher lipophilicity (ClogP) than their corresponding
flavones, and, consequently, were anticipated to better penetrate the BBB. Moreover, they showed
improved in vitro antioxidant activity with respect to scavenging hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, we
expected the selenoflavonoids to be more druggable and more potent neuroprotective agents.

3.1. Chemistry
3.1.1. General Information
CH2 Cl2 and THF used for the reaction were Liquid Chromatography grade reagents and were
redistilled from calcium hydride and sodium benzophenone ketyl, respectively. All other reagents
were obtained commercially and used as received without additional purification. Reactions were
monitored by thin-layer chromatography on 0.25 mm silica plates (F-254) visualized with ultraviolet
(UV) light (254 nm) and KMnO4 solution. Flash chromatography was performed using silica gel
(230–400 mesh) with hexanes and EtOAc as eluents. 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectra were recorded on Varian Gemini 200 MHz or Agilent 400 MHz NMR spectrometers.
Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm), and coupling constants (J) are expressed
in Hertz (Hz).
3.1.2. General Procedure for the Acylation of Bromobenzenes
Aluminum chloride powder (2.0 mmol) was suspended in CH2 Cl2 (10 mL) at 0 ˝ C. Cinnamoyl
chloride (1.2 mmol) in CH2 Cl2 (5 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. Then, a
solution of bromobenzene (1.0 mmol) in CH2 Cl2 (5 mL) was added dropwise and stirred for another
2 h. After the addition of water (20 mL), the organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was
extracted with CH2 Cl2 (3 ˆ 30 mL). The combined organic extracts were filtered through a celite pad,
washed with water (3 ˆ 100 mL) and brine (100 mL), dried (MgSO4 ), and concentrated. The resulting
residue was purified by flash chromatography to give (4a, 4b) in 85%–87% yields.

3.1.3. General Procedure for the Formation of Selenoflavanones
To a THF (10 mL) solution of (4a, 4b) at ´78 ˝ C, 1.7 M t-BuLi solution in pentane was slowly
added over a 10 min period. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 ˝ C for 30 min, and selenium
powder (0.34 mmol) was added in two portions. The reaction mixture was kept at 0 ˝ C for 5 min and
then at room temperature for 30 min. After the addition of HCl (1 M, 10 mL), the organic material
was extracted with Et2 O (3 ˆ 10 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over MgSO4 and
concentrated. The residue was dissolved in absolute EtOH (10 mL) and stirred vigorously in the
presence of NaOH (15 mg) for 30 min. The solution was concentrated, and the resulting residue was
purified by flash chromatography to give (1a, 1b) in 88%–92% yields.

3.1.4. General Procedure for the Acylation of Phenols
An appropriate phenol compound (1 mmol) and cinnamoyl chloride (1.07 mmol) were dissolved
in a BF3 -Et2 O complex (5 mL) and heated to reflux. After a 15 min reaction, the reaction mixture was
quenched with an excess of water. Then, the organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer
was extracted with EtOAc (2 ˆ 10 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed with water
(2 ˆ 10 mL) and brine (10 mL), dried (MgSO4 ), and concentrated. The resulting residue was purified

3.2. In Vitro Cell Viability
3.2.1. Cell Culture
SH-SY5Y cells (human neuroblastoma) were obtained from the Korean cell line bank (KCLB,
Seoul, Korea). Cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin sulfate
(100 µg/mL) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Cells were cultured at 37 ˝ C in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 .
3.2.2. MTT Assay
SH-SY5Y cells (1 ˆ 104 ) were seeded in wells containing 100 µL of Roswell Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI) medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a 96-well plate. Cells were pretreated
with various concentrations (10´6 –10´8 M) of the test compounds for 1 h, followed by exposure to
100 µM of H2 O2 for another 3 h. To produce oxidative stress, H2 O2 was freshly prepared from a 30%
stock solution prior to each experiment. The control cells were added to the same medium without
H2 O2 or test compounds. Then media were carefully changed to new media (H2 O2 free). After 48 h
29579

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16, 29574–29582

incubation, 50 µL of MTT (5 mg/mL stock solution) was added and the plates were incubated for an
additional 4 h. The medium was discarded and the formazan blue, which was formed in the cells,
was dissolved with 100 µL DMSO. The optical density was measured at 540 nm. Data were expressed
as mean ˘ S.E.M. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by the Newman-Keuls test. *** p < 0.001 compared with the control group. ### p < 0.001
compared with the H2 O2 -only treated group
3.3. In Vivo Neuroprotective Activity
3.3.1. Transient Ischemia Model
All in vivo experimental sections were carried out in accordance with the Principles of Laboratory
Animal Care (National Institutes of Health (NIH) publication (NIH: Bethesda, MD, USA), #85-23,
revised 1985) and the Animal Care and Use guidelines of Kyung Hee University, Korea. All test
subjects were adult male imprinting control region (ICR) mice weighing between 24–32 g at the time
of surgery. Anesthesia of the animals was conducted in a chamber with a mixture of N2 O and O2
(70:30) containing 2.5% isoflurane, and were continued by inhalation of 1.5% isoflurane. Intraluminal
filament method [25] with the modifications described previously [26] was used to induce middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The procedures were as in the following. A mid-line incision was
made on the ventral surface of the neck, and the right common carotid arteries and external carotid
artery were isolated and ligated with an 8.0 silk suture. A polyamide monofilament (Ethilon, Johnson
and Johnson Intl., Zaventum, Belgium) coated into a round tip with silicone resin (Xantopren, Byer
Dental, Kiel, Germany) was introduced into the intracranial internal carotid artery through an incision
in the common carotid artery. The filament was then carefully advanced approximately 10 mm distal
to the carotid bifurcation, beyond the origin of the middle cerebral artery. After 90 min of MCAO,
mice were re-anesthetized and the occluding filament was gently withdrawn back into the common
carotid artery to allow reperfusion to take place. Sham-operated mice underwent the same surgical
procedure, except that the filament was not advanced far enough to occlude the middle cerebral
artery. Body temperature was maintained at 37 ˘ 0.5 ˝ C throughout the surgery using a heating
pad (Biomed S.L., Balearic Islands, Spain). Heart rate, arterial blood oxygen saturation of arterial
hemoglobin and ECG were monitored throughout the procedure (SurgiVet, Norwell, MA, USA).
3.3.2. Drug Administration
Mice subjected to MCAO were randomly assigned to receive either drug or vehicle treatments. Each
drug (40 mg/kg), dissolved in 6% Cremophor with 0.5% DMSO, was introduced intraperitoneally
at 30 min after MCAO. MCI-186 (3-Methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one, Sigma-Aldrich Co. Natick,
MA, USA) was used as a positive control. MCI-186 is a free radical scavenger that has been used to
reduce the neuronal damage following acute brain ischemia and subsequent cerebral infarction [27].
It is also called Edaravone and has marteked in Japan by the brand name Radicut. To the mice in the
MCI-186 treatment group, 5 mg/kg of MCI-186 dissolved in saline was injected intravenously using
the same time schedule. The vehicle treatment group was subjected to the identical experimental
protocol, except that they received the same volume/weight of vehicle only.
3.3.3. Morphometric Measurement of Infarct Volume and Edema
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining was used to measure the cerebral infarction
area. TTC is a reliable marker to highlight mitochondrial function, as well as stable indicator of
ischemic areas for up to 3 days after ischemia [28,29]. Animals were decapitated after 22.5 h of
reperfusion and their brains were carefully taken out. The brain slices were prepared along the
coronal plane with a brain slicer for mice (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL, USA) at
2 mm intervals, starting 1 mm from the frontal pole. TTC staining of the brain slices were performed
by 60 min of incubation in a 2% solution of TTC at 37 ˝ C followed by fixed-immersion with 10%

29580

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16, 29574–29582

neutral-buffered formalin. Computerized image analysis system (TDI Scope Eye 3.0, Samkyung Intl.
Co., Seoul, Korea) was used to determine the infarction area (mm2 ) in each section. The total lesion
volume (mm3 ) was calculated by summing the infarct area in each section (seven slices in all) and
multiplying this by the distance between sections. Both contralateral and ipsilateral hemisphere areas
were measured, and the differences between the two areas were used to calculate the edema volume.
TTC and neutral-buffered formalin were purchased from the Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Natick, MA, USA).
The significance of the differences between the total infarction volumes of the control (n = 10),
MCI-186 (5 mg/kg, IV, n = 8), the selenoflavanone (40 mg/kg, IP, n = 8), and the flavanone (40 mg/kg,
IP, n = 8) treated groups was determined by one way ANOVA followed by Student-Newman-Keuls
test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 compared with the control group. # p < 0.05, ## p < 0.01,
### p < 0.001 compared with the flavanone treated group.
4. Conclusions
We synthesized selenoflavanones and flavanones using two steps, and evaluated their
physicochemical properties and biological activities. The selenoflavanones showed lower polarity
and higher lipophilicity than the corresponding flavanones, which suggests that they would be able to
more easily penetrate the BBB. In our in vitro assay, hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death decreased
with selenoflavanone treatment. Consequently, we confirmed the antioxidant effect and safety of
the selenoflavanones. The total infarction volumes in the transient ischemia mouse model were
significantly reduced by selenoflavanone treatment. Furthermore, the selenoflavanones resulted in
more potent neuroprotective activity than the flavanones. Based on these observations, we anticipate
that selenium substitution could be an effective approach for developing a neuroprotective agent.
