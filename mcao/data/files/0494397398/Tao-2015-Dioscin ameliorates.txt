We previously reported the promising effect of dioscin against hepatic ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury,
but its effect on cerebral I/R injury remains unknown. In this work, an in vitro oxygen–glucose
deprivation and reoxygenation (OGD/R) model and an in vivo middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
model were used. The results indicated that dioscin clearly protected PC12 cells and primary cortical
neurons against OGD/R insult and signiﬁcantly prevented cerebral I/R injury. Further research demonstrated that dioscin-induced neuroprotection was accompanied by a signiﬁcant inhibition in the
expression and the nuclear to cytosolic translocation of HMGB-1, reﬂected by decreased TLR4 expression.
Blockade of the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6 signaling pathway by dioscin inhibited NF-κB and AP-1 transcriptional activities, MAPK and STAT3 phosphorylation, and pro-inﬂammatory cytokine responses, and
upregulated the levels of anti-inﬂammatory factors. In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) and
overexpressed genes of HMGB-1 and TLR4 were applied in in vitro experiments, respectively, and the
results further conﬁrmed that dioscin showed an efﬁcient neuroprotection because of its inhibiting
effects on HMGB-1/TLR4 signaling and subsequent suppressing inﬂammation. These ﬁndings provide
new insights that will aid in elucidating the effect of dioscin against cerebral I/R injury and support the
development of dioscin as a potential treatment for ischemic stroke.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke, the second most common cause of death, is a
leading cause of acquired disability in adults. Worldwide, approximately 15 million people suffer from strokes each year, and approximately 5 million die as a result [1]. A combination of restoration of
blood ﬂow and reoxygenation is the only globally approved method
for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, the subsequent
reperfusion phase results in brain injury, including blood-brain barrier
disruption, hemorrhagic transformation, and massive brain edema [2].
Patients who suffer ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced cerebral injury
also suffer enormous pain, and I/R greatly burdens families and society
as a whole [3]. Many basic and clinical experiments have indicated
that neuroinﬂammation plays a key role in the primary and secondary

injury phases of stroke [4]. Development of an effective antiinﬂammatory drug may be an efﬁcient approach for the treatment
of ischemic stroke-induced brain injury [5,6]. However, many antineuroinﬂammatory drugs including enlimomab and indomethacin
show poor outcomes for the treatment of ischemic stroke in clinical
trials [7]. Therefore, investigations of the underlying mechanisms of
postischemic neuroinﬂammatory cascades are urgently needed for the
development of new and effective therapies for ischemic stroke.
The family of toll-like receptors (TLRs) includes at least 13
members that are widely expressed in cells. TLRs were originally
described as pivotal mediators of innate and acquired immunity.
We now know that TLRs are germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors that play key roles in the recognition of various
microbial pathogens including lipopolysaccharide and damageassociated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) [8,9]. TLR4, the
ﬁrst mammalian TLR to be characterized, is constitutively expressed in various brain cells and blood-borne immune cells, which
can promote the activation of inﬂammatory response.
High-mobility group protein 1 (HMGB-1), an important DAMP,
is released from necrotic and dying neural cells in the ischemic
brain, which can trigger TLR4 [10]. Brieﬂy, TLR4 activation by

104

HMGB-1 triggers the TLR4 adaptor protein myeloid differentiation
primary response gene (88) (MyD88), which can activate a
signalosome comprising TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6),
interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), and mitogenactivated protein kinase 7 (TAK1). Sequentially, this complex can
stimulate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) translocation. Moreover,
the TRAF6–IRAK1–TAK1 complex triggers mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation including p38, JNK, and ERK,
which play key roles in inﬂammation. The activation of these
molecules subsequently activates jun oncogene (AP-1) transcription and the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3). Finally, these signaling pathways and
molecules cause neuroinﬂammatory responses and injury after
ischemic stroke [11–13]. Accordingly, the therapeutic strategy
associated with HMGB-1/TLR4 signaling might represent a promising approach to the restriction of neuroinﬂammatory processes
and the amelioration of cerebral stroke damage.
Traditional Chinese medicines, used in China for thousands of
years with high efﬁciency and low toxicity, have attracted great
interest in recent years [14]. Some active natural components,
including ligustilide from Angelica sinensis Diels [15], madecassoside from Centella asiatica Urban [16], and ginkgolide B from
Ginkgo biloba L. [17], show excellent activities against cerebral
I/R injury. Therefore, it is reasonable to exploit effective herbal
products for the treatment of cerebral I/R injury.
Dioscin (Supplementary Fig. 1a), a natural steroidal saponin, is
isolated from some medicinal plants including Dioscorea nipponica
Makino and Dioscorea zingiberensis C. H. Wright [18,19]. Pharmacological investigations have shown that dioscin exhibits antifungal [20], antitumor [21,22], and hepatoprotective activities [23,24].
Our previous works have shown that dioscin has potent antiinﬂammatory activities against alcohol-induced liver injury [25]
and I/R-induced hepatic damage via reducing HMGB-1 expression
[26]. However, no papers have been published to report the effects
of dioscin against cerebral I/R injury to the best of our knowledge.
Therefore, we decided to explore whether dioscin ameliorated
neuroinﬂammation and brain injury after ischemic stroke, and
whether blockade of the HMGB-1/TLR4 signaling pathway was
involved in the underlying molecular mechanism.

provided by Roche Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland). SiRNA and overexpression DNA (pEX-3) of HMGB-1 and TLR4 and Lipofectamine 2000
were provided by GenePharma (Shanghai, China).
PC12 cell culture
The PC12 cell line was purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry
Cell Biology (Shanghai, China) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium,
which was supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL of penicillin, and
100 U/mL streptomycin at 37 1C in 5% CO2 in a saturated humidiﬁed
incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, MA, USA). The cells were allowed
to adhere and grow for 24 h in the culture medium prior to treatment
in all experiments.
Primary cortical neuron isolation and culture
Primary cortical neurons were isolated from neonatal SpragueDawley (SD) rats (o24 h) based on the previously described
method [30]. Brieﬂy, the cerebral cortices were isolated and
digested in 0.25% trypsin at 37 1C for 30 min and mechanically
dissociated. The resulting cell suspension was plated at a density
of 1.5  105 cells/cm2 in poly-L-lysine (0.1 mg/mL) precoated wells
and seeded in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 10 μM cytosine-Darabinofuranoside, 100 U/mL of penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin in a humidiﬁed atmosphere (95% air and 5% CO2) at 37 1C.
The DMEM was replaced with Neurobasal-A medium containing
2% B27 NeuroMix, 10 μM cytosine-D-arabinofuranoside, 100 U/mL
of penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin after 3 h plating to
culture the primary cortical neurons. The cells were used for
experiments after 7 days of culture in a constant temperature
and humidity incubator.
Dioscin toxicity assay
Cell viabilities of PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons were
determined after 24 h of pretreatment with various concentrations
of dioscin (0–1, 600 ng/mL) according to the MTT method. The
absorbance of the samples was quantiﬁed at 490 nm using a
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, MA, USA).

Materials and methods
OGD/R model
Chemicals and materials
Dioscin was isolated from Dioscorea nipponica Makino in our
laboratory with a purity of over 98% analyzed by high-performance
liquid chromatography, and the chemical structure of the compound
was identiﬁed by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance
[27–29]. Dioscin was added to the serum-free medium by dissolving
with DMSO whose ﬁnal concentration was less than 0.1% in cell
experiments, and in animal experiments, dioscin was suspended in
0.5% sodium carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC-Na). Nylon ﬁlaments
were purchased from Beijing West Thick Technology (Beijing, China).
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and diaminobenzidine
(DAB) staining kits and an LDH detection kit were obtained from
Nanjing Jiancheng Institute of Biotechnology (Nanjing, China). Fetal
bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from
Hyclone Laboratories, Inc. (MA, USA). Dulbecco's minimum essential
medium (DMEM), Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI 1640)
Neurobasal-A medium, B27 NeuroMix, cytosine-D-arabino-furanoside,
poly-L-lysine, and trypsin were purchased from Gibco (CA, USA). A
tissue protein extraction kit was purchased from KEYGEN Biotech. Co.,
Ltd. (China). A bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit was purchased from
Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). 40 ,6-Diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

The PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons were treated with
dioscin (50, 100, and 200 ng/mL) for 12 h. The cells were then
incubated in glucose-free Earle’s balanced salt solution (BSS)
containing 143 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.0 mM MgSO4, 1.0 mM
NaH2PO4, 1.8 mM CaCl2, and 2.4 mM Hepes and immediately
transferred to a humidiﬁed incubator containing an atmosphere
of 1% O2, 94% N2, and 5% CO2 at 37 1C for 4 h to model I/R
conditions in vitro [31]. Next, a 24-h reoxygenation period was
begun by rapidly replacing the BSS with normal medium and
conditions. The model groups were cultured as described above
without dioscin pretreatment, and the control groups were cultured in a common medium under normal conditions during the
entire experiment.
Cell viability analysis
The PC12 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in a volume of 100 μL
per well (cell density, 1  105 cells/mL), and the cells were allowed to
adhere and grow for 24 h. Primary cortical neurons were isolated and
cultured as described above, and cell suspensions (1.5  105 cells/cm2)
were plated into poly-L-lysine precoated 96-well plates for 7 days. The
cells were then pretreated with dioscin and subjected to OGD/R injury.

X. Tao et al. / Free Radical Biology and Medicine 84 (2015) 103–115

Cell viabilities of PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons were
assessed according to the MTT assay. LDH release was determined
using an assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions to
conﬁrm the reliability of the MTT results. Culture media were
harvested after OGD/R injury, and cells were lysed using 0.2% Triton
X-100 for 30 min to release intracellular LDH. The absorbance of the
samples was measured at 490 nm using a spectrophotometer.
NeuN detection in primary cortical neurons
The primary cortical neurons in six-well plates (1.5  105 cells/cm2)
were ﬁxed using 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 0.2%
Triton X-100 for 10 min after dioscin pretreatment and OGD/R injury.
The cells were incubated with 5% goat serum albumin for 1 h at 37 1C
to block nonspeciﬁc binding and then incubated with the anti-NeuN
antibody (1:100 dilution) overnight at 4 1C. The cells were incubated
with a TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (HþL) (Proteintech
Group, Chicago, IL, USA) for 1 h at 37 1C and then counterstained
using DAPI (5 μg/mL) for 10 min. Images of the cells were obtained
using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica, TCS SP5, Germany).

into 2.0-mm-thick slices. Coronal brain sections were stained with
1% TTC at 37 1C for 30 min and then ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 24 h. The stained slices were photographed using a digital
camera. The area of infarction in each slice was measured using
the software Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA); infarct
volume was calculated as the product of average thickness (2 mm)
and the sum of infarction areas in all examined slices. Infarct
volume (%) ¼ total infarct volume/total section volume  100.
Relative brain weight and the ratio of the right and left volumes
were also evaluated: relative brain weight (%) ¼ the whole brain
weight/body weight  100; right/left brain volume ratio ¼ right
brain hemisphere volume/left brain hemisphere volume.
LDH activity assay
After 24 h MCAO, the ischemic brain tissue at the level of bregma
þ0.7 to 4.3 mm in each group was obtained after an overnight
fasting. LDH activity in brain tissue was detected by using a commercial kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Examination of neurological deﬁcits and survival rates

Animals
Male SD rats (180–220 g) were obtained from the Experimental
Animal Center at Dalian Medical University (Dalian, China) (SCXK:
2008-0002). All experimental procedures were performed in strict
accordance with PR China Legislation Regarding the Use and Care
of Laboratory Animals, and all experiments were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Dalian Medical University. The
rats were allowed to adapt to the new environment for 1 week
before the experiments, which were housed in a room under 12-h
light/dark cycles, a relative humidity of 60 7 10%, and a controlled
temperature of 227 3 1C. The rats were allowed ad libitum access
to water and a standard pellet diet throughout the experiment.
Pharmacological treatments and MCAO
The rats were randomly divided into ﬁve groups for the
prophylactic test: animals in sham and MCAO (model) groups
were treated with vehicle (0.5% CMC-Na); MCAO þ dioscin (Dio)
groups were treated with 60, 40, and 20 mg/kg of dioscin. Dioscin
was administered intragastrically (i.g.) once daily for 7 consecutive
days. Transient focal ischemia was induced on the eighth day via
right MCAO in the model and dioscin-treated rats using the
reforming Longa method as described previously [32]. Brieﬂy, rats
were anesthetized using intraperitoneal (ip) chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg), and the right common carotid artery, external carotid
artery, and internal carotid artery (ICA) were exposed via a midline
laparotomy of the neck skin. A coated 0.26-mm nylon ﬁlament was
introduced into the right ICA and advanced approximately
18–20 mm to the origin of the middle cerebral artery to occlude
it. MCAO was deemed successful following the observation of left
hemiparesis. The nylon ﬁlament was carefully withdrawn to
establish reperfusion for 24 h after a 2 h MCAO. Rats in the sham
group underwent similar surgical procedures without MCAO.
The rats in the therapeutic test were also randomly divided into
ﬁve groups: animals in sham and model groups were administered
0.5% CMC-Na, and rats in the dioscin groups received dioscin i.g. at
60, 40, and 20 mg/kg once daily after MCAO.
Determination of infarction volume
TTC staining was performed as described previously to determine brain infarction volume [33]. Brieﬂy, the rats were rapidly
decapitated after 24 h of reperfusion, and the brains were removed
and frozen at -20 1C for 20 min. The frozen brains were then sliced

Neurological impairment was evaluated according to the methods
described by Longa et al. and Bederson et al. [34,35] (Supplementary
Table 1). In the prophylactic test, neurobehavioral testing was performed after 24 h reperfusion following ischemia induction by one
examiner who was blind to the experimental groups. In the therapeutic test, neurobehavioral testing was performed after 1 day, 2 days,
3 days, 4 days, and 5 days of reperfusion with the Garcia18 scoring
system, and the rats survival rates were assessed meanwhile.
Histopathological examination
After 24 h reperfusion, the rats were deeply anesthetized and
then perfused through the heart with 4 1C phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Ischemic brain
tissues at the level of bregma þ 0.7 to -4.3 mm and hippocampa
in the right hemisphere were obtained. The samples were ﬁnally
ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in parafﬁn to cut for
5-μm slices. The slices were used for hematoxylin–eosin (H&E),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The staining images
were acquired using a light microscope (Leica DM4000B, Germany)
with 200  magniﬁcation.
In situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling
(TUNEL) assay
As noted above, the deparafﬁnized sections were performed by
TUNEL assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Brieﬂy,
the ﬂuorescein (green)-labeled dUTP solution was added on the
sections and incubated at 37 1C for 1 h and then washed with PBS,
and the images were photographed using ﬂuorescence microscopy
(Olympus BX63, Japan) with 200  magniﬁcation. Brain damage
was evaluated by the average number of positive cells (green
spots) in the ﬂuorescent images.
Immunohistochemical examination
For histopathological examination, the slices were deparafﬁnized
and rinsed with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 30 min, followed
by incubating in 5% goat serum albumin for 30 min to block
nonspeciﬁc protein binding. Then, the sections were incubated
overnight at 4 1C with rabbit anti-NeuN antibody (1:100, dilution),
followed by incubating biotin-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 15 min, respectively.
Eventually, the slides were incubated in DAB solution for 10 min at

106

37 1C, counterstained by hematoxylin, and mounted with resinene.
The photographs were acquired by a light microscope (Leica
DM4000B, Germany) with 200  magniﬁcation. IODs of photographs
were assayed by using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, USA).
Immunoﬂuorescence examination
Parafﬁn sections were dewaxed as described above, and then the
sections were incubated in a moist box for overnight at 4 1C with
the rabbit anti-NeuN, anti-GFAP, anti-Kir4.1 antibodies at a 1:100
dilution after the blocking of nonspeciﬁc protein binding by 5% goat
serum albumin, followed by incubation with TRITC-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (HþL) (Proteintech Group, Chicago, USA) for 1 h at
37 1C, and then counterstained by DAPI (5 μg/ml) for 10 min.
Images were captured by a ﬂuorescent microscope (Olympus
BX63, Japan) with 200  magniﬁcation. Fluorescent intensity of
image was evaluated by using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media
Cybernetics, USA).

HMGB-1 and TLR4 siRNA transfection experiments
SiRNA transfection was used to downregulate HMGB-1 and
TLR4 expressions. The sequences of HMGB-1 and TLR4 siRNAs are
listed in Supplementary Table 4. Brieﬂy, HMGB-1-targeted siRNA
and control siRNA were dissolved separately in Opti-MEM. The
solutions were equilibrated for 5 min at room temperature, and
each RNA solution was combined with Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (siRNA:Lipofectamine 2000 ¼1 pmol:0.05 μL). The samples were mixed gently and allowed to form siRNA liposomes for
20 min. The PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons were transfected with the transfection mixture in antibiotic-free cell culture
medium. NeuN release, cell viabilities, and the protein levels of
HMGB-1 and TLR4 were detected after 24 and 48 h of transfection.
In addition, the same procedure of TLR4 siRNA transfection was
also carried out. The cell viability and the protein levels of TLR4,
p-STAT3, NF-κB, and AP-1 were detected after 24 and 48 h of
transfection.
HMGB-1 and TLR4 overexpression DNA transfection experiments

Quantitative real-time PCR assay
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, ischemic brain tissue at the
level of bregma -2.6 to -4.3 mm in the ipsilateral hemisphere was
obtained, and the total RNA samples were extracted by using
RNAiso Plus reagent (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Also, total RNA from PC12
cells and primary cortical neurons were extracted. The purity of
the extracted RNA was determined, and then reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China)
following the manufacturer’s instructions with a TC-512 PCR
system (TECHNE, UK). Then, the levels of mRNA expression were
quantiﬁed by real-time PCR with SYBR PremixEx Taq II (Tli RNaseH
Plus) (TaKaRa Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) and ABI 7500 realtime PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). The sequences of the
primers are shown in Supplementary Table 2. A no-template
control was analyzed in parallel for each gene, and a GAPDH gene
was selected as the housekeeping gene in our study. Eventually,
the unknown template was calculated through the standard curve
for quantitative analysis.

Overexpressed DNA transfection was used to upregulate
HMGB-1 and TLR4 expression levels. HMGB-1-targeted DNA overexpression (pEX-3) and control DNA (pEX-3) were transfected into
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (DNA:Lipofectamine
2000 ¼1 μg:2.5 μL). The cells were used for other experiments
after 24 and 48 h of transfection. NeuN release, cell viabilities, and
protein levels of HMGB-1 and TLR4 were detected after 24 and
48 h of transfection of primary cortical neurons and PC12. In
addition, the same procedure of TLR4 DNA transfection was also
carried out. The cell viabilities and the protein levels of TLR4,
p-STAT3, NF-κB, and AP-1 were detected after 24 and 48 h of
transfection.
Statistical analysis
All the data were analyzed using statistical software SPSS 18.0 and
expressed as means 7 SD. Differences among groups were determined using one-way ANOVA, followed by a post hoc LSD test.
Comparisons between two groups were performed using an unpaired
Student’s t test. Po0.05 and Po0.01 were considered to be
signiﬁcant.

Western blotting assay
Results
Twenty-four hours after MCAO, ischemic brain tissue at the
level of bregma þ0.7 to -2.6 mm in the right hemisphere was
obtained. Then, total protein and nuclear and cytolymph proteins
were extracted from the tissues using appropriate cold lysis buffer
containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride based on the
manufacturer’s instructions. The PC12 cells and primary cortical
neurons were plated in 6-well plates and treated, and then the
protein samples were collected using the same method. Finally,
the protein samples were loaded onto the SDS-PAGE gel (10–15%),
separated electrophoretically, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, USA). After blocking nonspeciﬁc binding sites for
1 h with 5% dried skim milk in TTBS at 37 1C, the membrane was
individually incubated for overnight at 4 1C with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 3). Then the membrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated antibodies at a 1:5000 dilution. Protein expression was
detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence method and imaged
using ChemiDoc XRS (Bio-Rad, USA). To eliminate the variations of
protein expression, the data were adjusted to correspond to
internal reference expression (IOD value of target protein versus
IOD of correspond internal reference).

Dioscin rehabilitated cell damage after OGD/R injury
The toxicities of dioscin on PC12 cells and primary cortical
neurons were assayed. Dioscin markedly inhibited cell proliferation
at a concentration of over 400 ng/mL (Supplementary Fig. 1b), and
therefore, the optimal concentration of dioscin in the range of
0–200 ng/mL was used in the cellular experiments. As shown in
Fig. 1a, normal PC12 cells exhibited a cone shape or multipolarity
with regular contours; however, OGD/R injury induced a rounded
shape with a large accumulation of cell debris. Dioscin signiﬁcantly
prevented these morphological changes in a dose-dependent manner. Primary cortical neurons exposed to OGD/R exhibited features
that are characteristic of neurodegeneration, including a loss of
synapses and brightness. However, control and dioscin-treated
neurons exhibited features that are characteristic of viable cells,
including bright compact somata with a round- oval shape and
intact synapses. As shown in Fig. 1b, the viability of PC12 cells
decreased to 49.1 7 5.6% after 4 h OGD and 12 h reperfusion, and
dioscin at concentrations of 200, 100, and 50 ng/mL signiﬁcantly
restored cell viabilities to 74.2 7 5.0, 66.1 7 5.2, and 54.6 7 6.0%,

respectively. The viability of primary cortical neurons decreased
notably after OGD/R, and 200, 100, and 50 ng/mL of dioscin
increased the cell viabilities in a dose-dependent manner.
Dioscin decreased LDH release from cells
As shown in Fig. 1b, OGD/R signiﬁcantly increased LDH levels in
PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons compared with control
groups, which were markedly decreased by dioscin.
Dioscin ameliorated NeuN release from primary cortical neurons
As shown in Fig. 1c, the control cells exhibited higher ﬂuorescence intensity of NeuN than the model group. Dioscin pretreatment (200, 100, and 50 ng/mL) dose dependently increased the
ﬂuorescence intensity.
Dioscin improved cerebral ischemic injury in rats
Staining with TTC showed that infarct volume (%) was 24.375.5%
in the model group, and 10.772.3, 12.973.4, and 16.172.5% in
dioscin-treated groups (60, 40, and 20 mg/kg), respectively (Fig. 2a,b),
which showed that dioscin signiﬁcantly decreased infarct volume. As
shown in Fig. 2c,d, dioscin notably improved neurological deﬁcits and
signiﬁcantly prevented cerebral I/R-induced increases in relative brain
weight, right/left volume ratio, and brain tissue LDH activities compared with the model group.

Dioscin improved neurological deﬁcits and survival rates in rats after
MCAO
Only 10% of rats in the model group survived after 2 h of
ischemia and 5 days of reperfusion, and dioscin at doses of 60, 40,
and 20 mg/kg improved the survival rates to 60, 40, and 30%,
respectively. Dioscin also signiﬁcantly improved neurological deficits compared with the model group (Fig. 2e).
Dioscin attenuated cerebral ischemia-induced morphological and
neuropathological changes in rats
As shown in Fig. 3a, the cerebral I/R-induced severe cellular edema,
coagulation necrosis with massive inﬂammatory cell inﬁltration in
cortical and nucleus pyknosis, anachromasis, and shrunken neuronal
bodies in the hippocampal CA1 region were obviously found based on
H&E staining, which were all dramatically attenuated by dioscin (60,
40, and 20 mg/kg). As shown in Fig. 3b,c, the number of TUNELpositive cells exhibiting green ﬂuorescence in the model group was
signiﬁcantly higher than that of the sham group, which was markedly
decreased by dioscin.
Neuropathological alterations in the brain were also examined
after 24 h reperfusion following 2 h of MCAO. Immunohistochemical and immunoﬂuorescent results showed that sham-operated
rats exhibited more NeuN-positive neurons in the ischemic cortex
than the model group (Fig. 4a,b). However, dioscin administration
dose dependently increased the number of NeuN-positive neurons
in the ischemic brain. The levels of glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein

(GFAP) and potassium inward-rectifying channels, subfamily J,
member 10 (Kir 4.1) were markedly higher in the model group
than in the sham group, which were obviously downregulated by
dioscin (Fig. 4b,c). Taken together, these results indicated that
dioscin treatment effectively reduced neuronal loss and astrocyte
and capillary endothelial cell activation, improving cerebral I/Rinduced neuropathological changes.

Dioscin improved cerebral inﬂammation after ischemia
As shown in Fig. 5a, compared with the sham group, the mRNA
levels of the pro- inﬂammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6,
ICAM-1, IFN-γ, MIP-1α, MIP-2, IL-17, and IL-23 were signiﬁcantly
increased, and the level of the anti-inﬂammatory cytokine IL-10
was markedly decreased in the model group (P o0.01). Dioscin

treatment clearly restored the levels of these mediators, and
dioscin also markedly downregulated the expression of the proinﬂammatory mediator MMP-9 compared with that of the model
group (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 1c). These results indicated
that dioscin decreased neuroinﬂammation after ischemia by
modulating innate and adaptive immunity.
Dioscin decreased HMGB-1 expression and reduced HMGB-1
translocation
As shown in Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 1c, the protein level
of total cHMGB-1 in ischemic brain was notably upregulated in the
model group compared with the sham control (P o0.01), which
was obviously downregulated by dioscin. In addition, the protein
level of nHMGB-1 was markedly decreased (Po0.01), whereas the
cyHMGB-1 level was markedly increased (P o0.01) in the model
group compared with the sham group, which was signiﬁcantly
rehabilitated by dioscin. Altogether, our ﬁndings suggested that
dioscin decreased HMGB-1 expression in the cortex and decreased
HMGB-1 nuclear translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm in
ischemic brain cells.
Dioscin inhibited the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6 signaling pathway
As shown in Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 1c, the effects of
dioscin on the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6 signaling pathway were investigated. Cerebral I/R signiﬁcantly upregulated the protein levels of
TLR4, MyD88, and TRAF6, which were obviously decreased by
dioscin with a dose-dependent manner.

Dioscin inhibited MAPKs, STAT3, NF-κB, and AP-1 signaling pathways
Dioscin pretreatment notably inhibited the phosphorylation
levels of p38, JNK, and ERK in cerebral ischemia brains (Fig. 5e and
Supplementary Fig. 1c). Additionally, dioscin signiﬁcantly
decreased the high protein levels of phosphorylated STAT3,
nuclear NF-κB, and AP-1 in cerebral ischemia brains in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5f,g and Supplementary Fig. 1c). These
ﬁndings suggested that dioscin inhibited MAPKs, STAT3, NF-κB,
and AP-1 activation caused by TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6-mediated signaling cascades.
Dioscin ameliorated cell inﬂammation after OGD/R injury
As shown in Fig. 6a, increased mRNA levels of the proinﬂammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in PC12 cells and
primary cortical neurons were observed in the OGD/R model
group (P o0.01), which were signiﬁcantly decreased by dioscin.
In addition, as shown in Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 2, dioscin
signiﬁcantly downregulated the MMP-9 protein level compared
with the OGD/R model group.
Dioscin decreased HMGB-1 expression and reduced HMGB-1
translocation after OGD/R injury
As shown in Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 2, the expression levels
of HMGB-1 in PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons were notably
upregulated in the OGD/R model group compared with those of the
control (Po0.01), which were markedly downregulated by dioscin in

a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the protein level of nHMGB1 was notably decreased (Po0.01), whereas the cyHMGB-1 level was
notably increased (Po0.01) in the OGD/R model group compared
with the control group, which were all signiﬁcantly restored by
dioscin. Thus, our data strongly suggested that dioscin markedly
decreased the expression and nuclear translocation of HMGB-1 from
nucleus to cytoplasm in cells.

Dioscin inhibited the TLR4 signaling pathway after OGD/R injury
As shown in Fig. 7a–d and Supplementary Fig. 3, OGD/R
signiﬁcantly induced TLR4 expression and suppressed the subsequent activation of its signaling effectors, reﬂected by the
increased levels of MyD88, TRAF6, p-STAT3, and MAPKs, and
nuclear translocation of NF-κB and AP-1 in the OGD/R model

group compared with the control group. Dioscin signiﬁcantly
inhibited the levels of TLR4 and its downstream proteins in a
dose-dependent manner, suggesting that dioscin against OGD/Rinduced cell injury might be through inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/
TRAF6-mediated MAPKs, STAT3, NF-κB, and AP-1 inﬂammatory
signaling pathways.
Dioscin slightly enhanced the neuroprotective effect of HMGB-1 siRNA
In the HMGB-1 small interfering RNA test, we found that HMGB-1
siRNA-1604 downregulated HMGB-1 expression the most in PC12 cells
and primary cortical neurons (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b), and was
selected for the subsequent experiments. Control siRNA exhibited a
slight toxicity to PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons after 24 and
48 h of transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Fig. 8a and
Supplementary Fig. 5). Moreover, blockade of HMGB-1 expression using
HMGB-1 siRNA transfection signiﬁcantly protected PC12 cells and
primary cortical neurons from OGD/R injury compared with the control
siRNA group (Po0.01). Dioscin (200 ng/mL) also attenuated the injury.
The neuroprotective effect of HMGB-1 siRNA after dioscin pretreatment
(200 ng/mL) was altered compared with HMGB-1 siRNA, but this
difference did not achieve statistical signiﬁcance (NS, P40.05). NeuN
release from primary cortical neurons was detected (Supplementary
Fig. 6), and the results showed that the control and control siRNA
treatment groups exhibited high ﬂuorescence intensities, and much
lower intensities were found in the model group. Pretreatment with
dioscin or HMGB-1 siRNA increased the ﬂuorescence intensity. However, the differences between the HMGB-1 siRNA and the HMGB-1
siRNA plus dioscin treatment groups were not statistically signiﬁcant
(NS, P40.05).
Similar results were also observed regarding the protein levels
of HMGB-1 and its acceptor, TLR4. HMGB-1 siRNA markedly

decreased HMGB-1 and TLR4 levels in PC12 cells and primary
cortical neurons after 24 and 48 h of transfection, and dioscin
(200 ng/mL) downregulated HMGB-1 and TLR4 levels (Fig. 8b,c
and Supplementary Fig. 7). The combination of HMGB-1 siRNA and
dioscin slightly altered the effect of HMGB-1 siRNA with no
statistical signiﬁcance (NS, P 4 0.05).

HMGB-1 DNA reversed the neuroprotective effects of dioscin
Control DNA exhibited little toxicity to PC12 cells and primary
cortical neurons after 24 or 48 h of transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (P4 0.05) (Fig. 9a and Supplementary Fig. 8).
Moreover, HMGB-1 overexpression following HMGB-1 DNA transfection aggravated OGD/R-induced PC12 cells and primary cortical
neuron injury compared to the control DNA group (P o 0.01).
Notably, HMGB-1 DNA plus dioscin treatment resulted in greater
injury than that in the control DNA plus dioscin treatment group,
suggesting that HMGB-1 DNA transfection abrogated the protective effects of dioscin (200 ng/mL) on cells after OGD/R injury
(Fig. 9a). NeuN release from primary cortical neurons was greatly
decreased in the model and HMGB-1 DNA treatment groups, and
pretreatment with dioscin plus control DNA resulted in higher
ﬂuorescence intensity (Supplementary Fig. 9). However, treatment
with HMGB-1 DNA plus dioscin resulted in lower ﬂuorescence
intensity than treatment with dioscin alone, and no signiﬁcant
differences were observed compared to the pure HMGB-1 DNA
treatment group.

Similar results were also observed for the expression levels of
HMGB-1 and TLR4 after 24 and 48 h of HMGB-1 DNA transfection
(Fig. 9b,c and Supplementary Fig. 10). The expression levels of HMGB1 and TLR4 in the HMGB-1 DNA plus dioscin group were markedly
higher than those of the control DNA plus dioscin treatment group,
and no signiﬁcant difference with the pure HMGB-1 DNA treatment
group was found. These ﬁndings suggested that HMGB-1 DNA
transfection abrogated the effects of dioscin (200 ng/mL) on
HMGB-1 and TLR4 expressions after OGD/R injury.
Dioscin slightly enhanced the neuroprotective effect of TLR4 siRNA
We found that TLR4 siRNA-2299 downregulated TLR4 expression in PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons to the greatest
extent (Supplementary Fig. 11a,b). Therefore, TLR4 siRNA-2299
was applied in subsequent experiments. As shown in Fig. 10a,
blockade of TLR4 expression using TLR4 siRNA transfection signiﬁcantly protected PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons from
OGD/R injury compared with the control siRNA group (P o0.01).
However, the difference of the neuroprotective effect between the
TLR4 siRNA plus dioscin (200 ng/mL) group and the pure TLR4
siRNA group did not achieve statistical signiﬁcance (NS, P4 0.05).
Furthermore, TLR4 siRNA markedly decreased the expression
levels of TLR4, p-STAT3, NF-κB, and AP-1 in cells after 24 and
48 h of transfection, and the combination of TLR4 siRNA and
dioscin slightly altered the effect of TLR4 siRNA with no statistical
signiﬁcance (Fig. 10b,c and Supplementary Fig. 12) (NS, P 4 0.05).
TLR4 DNA reversed the neuroprotective effects of dioscin

(P o0.01). However, TLR4 DNA plus dioscin treatment resulted in
greater injury than that in the control DNA plus dioscin treatment
group, suggesting that TLR4 DNA abrogated the protective effects
of dioscin (200 ng/mL) on cells after OGD/R injury. In addition, the
TLR4 DNA plus dioscin treatment group exhibited signiﬁcantly
higher expression levels of TLR4, p-STAT3, NF-κB, and AP-1 than
the control DNA plus dioscin treatment group (P o0.01), suggesting that TLR4 overexpression following TLR4 DNA transfection
abrogated the effects of dioscin (200 ng/mL) on the levels of TLR4,
p-STAT3, NF-κB, and AP-1 after OGD/R injury (Fig. 11b,c and
Supplementary Fig. 13).

Discussion
Ischemic stroke, an important cause of death and acquired
disability in adults, is associated with several risk factors, including
atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, thrombosis, and smoking
[36]. Numerous studies on stroke have been performed in recent
decades, but the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke has not been
fully elucidated, and few medicines are available [37].
Previous research has shown that immunity and inﬂammation
are integral parts of the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Inﬂammatory signaling is activated and completed by blood-borne leukocytes that penetrate the brain during the ischemic phase. The ﬁnal
aim of inﬂammation is to reestablish homeostasis, but inﬂammation severely injures metastable tissues [38]. The latest evidence
indicates that TLRs are the innate and adaptive immune cell
receptors of the pathogen recognition receptor family (PRR) and
DAMP recognition, and the DAMP/TLRs signaling pathway plays a

critical role in the progress of postischemic neuroinﬂammation [39].
Therefore, immunomodulation through DAMP/TLRs signaling
represents a potential therapeutic approach to alleviate brain injury
after ischemic stroke.
HMGB1 is a nuclear DNA-binding protein that plays a key role
in the bending of DNA and the regulation of transcription to
stabilize nucleosomes under normal conditions. However, HMGB1 is also an important DAMP, which activates TLR4 signaling
following rapid translocation to the cytoplasm or release from
dying cells after cerebral ischemia [40]. Subsequently, the activation of TLR4 signaling at the plasma membrane triggers NF-κB,
MAPK, STAT3, and AP-1 signaling, which in turn increases innate
and acquired immunity and further heightens the postischemic
neuroinﬂammation response [12,13,41]. Accordingly, intercepting
the HMGB-1/TLR4 signaling pathway is a promising therapeutic
strategy for alleviating cerebral stroke injury and limiting neuroinﬂammation.
Our previous investigation described the effect of dioscin on
hepatic I/R injury [26], and this study investigates the protective effect
of dioscin against ischemic stroke for the ﬁrst time. PC12 cells and

primary cortical neurons from rats were used to examine the effects of
dioscin on OGD/R-induced injury, which is a commonly used in vitro
model of ischemic insult [42,43]. The exposure of PC12 cells or primary
cortical neurons to 4 h of OGD followed by 12 h of reoxygenation
resulted in signiﬁcantly lower cell viabilities than those observed for
control cells under the same conditions. However, the incubation of
PC12 cells or primary cortical neurons with dioscin (200, 100, and
50 ng/mL) for 12 h before OGD/R markedly increased the cell viabilities. Dioscin also signiﬁcantly decreased LDH release and prevented
NeuN- immunopositive neuron decrease after OGD/R injury. In the
present work, rat cerebral I/R, an in vivo well-established experimental
model of ischemic stroke, was conﬁrmed by the increased infarction
volume, neurological deﬁcits, relative brain weight, and right/left
volume ratio as well as the H&E staining of cortical areas and
hippocampal CA1 [37], which were all improved by dioscin, and the
compound at doses of 60, 40, and 20 mg/kg signiﬁcantly improved
neurological deﬁcits and rat survival rate after 2 h of MCAO. Then, the
effects of dioscin on cerebral histopathological changes after 24 h of
reperfusion following 2 h MACO were tested. It is well known that the

114

activated astrocytes and brain capillary endothelial cells evaluated by
GFAP and Kir 4.1, respectively, play considerable roles in the development of postischemic neuroinﬂammation and neuronal damage. Our
work demonstrated that the expression levels of GFAP and Kir 4.1 were
notably high in the ischemic cerebral cortex of the model rats. A
decrease in the number of NeuN-positive neurons and an increase in
the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were also observed.
However, dioscin pretreatment effectively reversed these postischemic
histopathological alterations. Our results showed that dioscin exhibited a potent ability to prevent and treat cerebral ischemia.
Previous studies have demonstrated that increased MMP-9 and
ICAM-1 levels after cerebral ischemia result in leukocyte vascular
adhesion and extravasation into ischemic brain parenchyma. These
alterations exacerbate neuroinﬂammation and brain injury through
the excessive production of neurotoxic cytokines including TNF-α, IL1β, and IL-6 from invading neutrophils and brain parenchyma cells,
IFN-γ from helper T cells, IL-17 from γδT cells, and IL-23, MIP-1α and
MIP-2 from inﬁltrating macrophages. IL-10 is also a pivotal cerebroprotective modulator that is secreted from Treg cells, and this
modulator can attenuate the activation of lymphocytes and microglia
inﬂammatory cascades after ischemic stroke [7,9,38]. The results
presented here showed that dioscin signiﬁcantly decreased the levels
of pro-inﬂammatory mediators including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, ICAM-1,
IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-23, MIP-1α, MIP-2, and MMP-9, and increased the level
of anti-inﬂammatory IL-10 in ischemic brain. Our results also demonstrated that dioscin dose dependently decreased the mRNA and
protein levels of pro-inﬂammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL1β, IL-6, and MMP-9, in OGD/R-treated PC12 cells and primary cortical
neurons. These results indicated that dioscin decreased neuroinﬂammation after ischemia via the modulation of innate and adaptive
immunity.
Dioscin dose dependently inhibited the expression levels and
translocation of HMGB-1 and its receptor TLR4, and downstream
proteins including MyD88, TRAF6, MAPKs, pSTAT3, NF-κB, and AP-1,
suggesting that the immunomodulatory effect of dioscin was
associated with the inhibition of HMGB-1/TLR4 signaling, which
contributed to its anti-inﬂammatory and neuroprotective effects
against cerebral ischemia. Moreover, the same results were
observed in PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons under OGD/R
conditions.
Experiments involving HMGB-1 and TLR4 knockdown [44] and
overexpression [45] using the siRNA and DNA transfection in cells
were performed to further elucidate the inhibitory effects of dioscin on
the HMGB-1/TLR4 signaling pathway. The results of the tests that were
conducted after 24 and 48 h of transfection using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent showed that the neuroprotective effects of HMGB-1 siRNA via
the blockade of HMGB-1 expression or TLR4 siRNA via the blockade of
TLR4 signaling pathway including p-STAT3, NF-κB, and AP-1 were
altered after dioscin pretreatment (200 ng/mL); however, these alterations were not statistically signiﬁcant (P40.05). In addition, HMGB-1
overexpression following HMGB-1 DNA transfection or TLR4 overexpression following TLR4 DNA transfection abrogated the protective
effects of dioscin on PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons after
OGD/R injury. Similar results were observed on the protein levels of
HMGB-1 and its acceptor TLR4 after HMGB-1 siRNA or HMGB-1 DNA
transfection, ajust as the downstream molecular including p-STAT3,
NF-κB and AP-1 after TLR4 siRNA or TLR4 DNA transfection. These
results further demonstrated that dioscin inhibited the HMGB-1/TLR4
signaling pathway in PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons
after OGD/R.
In summary, dioscin conferred direct protective effects on the
ischemic brain by inhibiting HMGB-1/TLR4 signaling and the
subsequent immune and neuroinﬂammatory responses in vivo
and in vitro models of ischemic brain. Accordingly, dioscin represents a novel and potent candidate that should be developed as a
new potent candidate for the treatment of postischemic brain

injury. Of course, further investigations are needed to elucidate the
mechanisms more deeply and to investigate the clinical applications of dioscin.
