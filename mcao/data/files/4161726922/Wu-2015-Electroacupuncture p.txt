Abstract. Electroacupuncture (EA) pretreatment has been
reported to induce tolerance against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury; however, the mechanisms underlying the
beneficial effects of EA remain to be elucidated. Increasing
evidence has suggested that excess activation of autophagy is
important in I/R injury. The present study aimed to investigate
the hypothesis that EA pretreatment‑induced tolerance to cerebral I/R injury was mediated by inhibition of the autophagy
pathway. Rats were treated with EA at the acupoint 'Baihui
(GV20)' 30 min/day, for five consecutive days prior to the
induction of focal cerebral ischemia for 120 min by middle
cerebral artery occlusion. Levels of autophagy, cerebral apoptosis, infarct volumes, brain water content and motor deficit
were evaluated 12 h following I/R. The autophagy inducer
rapamycin was used to investigate the role of autophagy in
mediating neuroprotective effects. The results showed that the
number of autophagosomes and the expression of the marker
proteins of autophagy, including microtubule‑associated
protein 1A light chain 3 (LC3)‑II and Beclin 1 were significantly increased 12 h post‑I/R. EA pretreatment decreased the
expression of autophagy markers and the number of autophagosomes in the ischemic cortex. In addition, EA pretreatment
inhibited neuronal apoptosis, reduced infarct volume and

water content, as well as improved neurological outcome of
rats following I/R. Furthermore, the reduced expression of
LC3‑II and Beclin 1 and the neuroprotective effects were
reversed by the autophagy inducer rapamycin. In conclusion,
the results of the present study demonstrated that EA pretreatment protected the brain against I/R injury via inhibition of
the autophagy process.
Introduction
As one of the most prevalent causes of human mortality, stroke
accounts for hundreds of thousands of mortalities annually
worldwide (1). Rapid revascularization of the occluded vessels
and timely reperfusion is one of the most effective approaches
to salvage cerebral ischemic damage; however, the restoration
of blood flow during reperfusion may evoke ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury that is not present during ischemia but
can be modulated only at reperfusion (2). Efforts have been
made to attenuate the injury occurring during reperfusion,
including numerous types of pretreatment measurements (2,3).
Electroacupuncture (EA) is a novel therapy based on traditional
acupuncture in combination with modern electrotherapy (4).
Evidence has shown that following vessel occlusion, EA not
only reduces myocardial injury but also significantly promotes
the recovery of neurological function and thus improves
quality of life for patients (5,6). In recent years, several studies
have shown that EA pretreatment has beneficial effects,
including reperfusion tolerance (7); however, it remains to be
elucidated whether the underlying mechanisms of EA require
the involvement of autophagy.
Autophagy, a cellular process mediating the lysosomal
degradation of long‑lived cytoplasmic proteins, is initiated
under different conditions, including differentiation, starvation,
stress (such as, oxidative or endoplasmic reticulum stress) and
protein aggregate accumulation (8‑10). During autophagy, cytoplasmic components are sequestered into double‑membrane
vesicles termed autophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes to produce single‑membraned autophagosomes and are
eventually degraded by lysosomal hydrolases (11,12). There
are at least two marked proteins in the autophagic cascade:

WU et al: AUTOPHAGIC MECHANISM OF ELECTROACUPUNCTURE

Microtubule‑associated protein 1A light chain 3 (LC3), which
exists in cytosolic form (LC3‑I) and membrane‑bound form
(LC3‑II), the ratio of conversation from LC3‑I to LC3‑II is
closely correlated with the extent of autophagosome formation (13); and Beclin 1, which is essential for recruitment of
other autophagic proteins during the expansion of pre‑autophagosomal membrane (14,15). Previous studies have reported the
autophagy was activated following ischemic injury; however, the
contribution of autophagy to neuronal survival/death remains
in debate. Autophagy activation maintains cellular homeostasis
and survival either through purging the cell of dysfunctional
organelles, toxic metabolites and intracellular pathogens, or
generating the intracellular building blocks required to preserve
vital functions during nutrient deprivation (16,17); for example,
the autophagy induced by focal ischemia preconditioning was
reported to be beneficial (18,19). Conversely, autophagy also
triggers non‑apoptotic programmed cell death (autophagic
cell death) through excessive self‑digestion and degradation of
essential cellular constituents, which was implicated in various
physiological and pathological conditions associated with
neurological diseases (20); for example, autophagy induced
by permanent cerebral ischemia was reported to be deleterious (21‑23). Overall, physiological levels of autophagy due to
mild hypoxia, appear to be protective. By contrast, increased
levels of autophagy due to severe hypoxia and/or reperfusion
may lead to self‑digestion and eventual cell death (24). The
present study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that EA
exerted neuroprotective effects via inhibition of autophagy
during reperfusion, using middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) model rats.
Materials and methods
The experimental protocol used in the present study was
approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation
of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (Nanjing, China),
and was conducted according to the Guidelines for Animal
Experimentation of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine.
Male Sprague‑Dawley rats, weighing 280‑320 g, were provided
by the Experimental Animal Center of the Nanjing University of
Chinese Medicine and were housed under controlled conditions
as follows: 12‑h light/dark cycle, 21±2˚C and 60‑70% humidity,
for a minimum of one week prior to drug treatment or surgery.
Rats were provided with a standard rodent diet and tap water
ad libitum. The focal ischemia/reperfusion models were
established through MCAO (25). During the procedure, room
temperature was maintained at 25˚C. All rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital
(40 mg/kg; Sigma‑Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and an incision was made on the midline of the neck. The right common
carotid artery (CCA), the external carotid artery (ECA) and
internal carotid artery (ICA) were isolated, and temporarily
ligated at their origin with a 6.0 silk suture. Microaneurysm
clips were placed around the CCA and CEA to prevent bleeding
during insertion of the suture. A hole was subsequently made
in the CCA, between the clips with a needle (2‑ml injector)
and the blunted tip of a nylon suture (diameter, 0.205  mm;
length, 20±2 mm) was inserted through the hole until a mild
resistance was felt. The two remaining loose collar sutures were
gently tightened, and the vessel clips were withdrawn. Rats

were anesthetized using an intraperitoneal injection of 40 mg/
kg sodium pentobarbital while undergoing EA stimulation or
surgery.
Experiment protocol. In order to determine the time‑dependent
effects of I/R on autophagy expression, rats were assigned at
random to one of the following four groups: Sham, 6 h following
I/R (I/R 6 h), I/R 12 h, and I/R 24 h. The optimum time‑point
was determined and rats were then assigned to one of the
following five groups: Sham, I/R 12 h, EA+I/R 12 h, Rapamycin+
EA+I/R 12 h (Sigma‑Aldrich) or Vehicle+EA+I/R 12 h (Fig. 1).
The rats in the sham group underwent an identical surgical
procedure without MCAO. I/R was established through MCAO
for 120 min followed by reperfusion for 12 h; EA pretreatment
was achieved through stimulation of the acupoint 'Baihui (GV20)'
on five consecutive days prior to I/R. Levels of autophagy were
determined using transmission electron microscopy and western
blot analysis. The neuroprotective effects of EA were determined
using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase‑mediated deoxyuridine‑triphosphatase nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, infarct
volumes, brain water content and motor deficit. The numbers of
rats used for each experiment are summarized in Table I.
EA pretreatment. EA pretreatment was performed at the
acupoint 'Baihui (GV20)' (5). The acupoint 'Baihui' is located
at the intersection of the sagittal midline and the line between
the two ears (26). Animals were anesthetized and stimulated at
an intensity of 1 mA and a frequency of 2/15 Hz for 30 min/day
for five consecutive days prior to MCAO, using the Hwato
Electronic Acupuncture Treatment Instrument (SDZ‑V; Suzhou
Medical Appliances Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China).
Transient focal cerebral ischemia. Rats were subjected to
transient MCAO for 120 min following the final pretreatment
as described above. Reperfusion was achieved by withdrawing
the suture following 120 min ischemia. Cerebral blood flow
(CBF) through the middle cerebral artery was measured
using laser Doppler flowmetry (PeriFlux 5000; Perimed,
Järfälla, Sweden). A flexible fiber‑optic probe (PeriFlux 5000;
Perimed) was affixed to the skull over the cortex supplied by
the proximal part of the middle cerebral artery (2 mm caudal
to bregma and 6 mm lateral to middle). Animals with <80%
reduction in CBF in the core of the middle cerebral artery area
were excluded from this study.
Treatment with the autophagy inducer. In order to determine
whether rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, attenuated the neuroprotective effects of EA at the acupoint 'Baihui (GV20)', rats were
treated with intracerebral ventricle injection (i.c.v.) of 35 pmol
rapamycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at the onset of reperfusion; the induction of autophagy using 35 pmol rapamycin was
significant according to previous studies (19). Rapamycin was
dissolved in ethanol and then diluted to the final concentration
using normal saline solution (final ethanol concentration, <2%).
Control animals received the same volume injection of vehicle.
Transmission electron microscopic examination. Following
reperfusion for 12 h, rats were anesthetized, as described above,
and then perfused with pre‑cooled phosphate‑buffered saline
(PBS; pH 7.4) followed by PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde

and 0.25% glutaraldehyde. The brains were removed and kept
overnight in a solution of 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). The following day, the rat
brains were sectioned using a vibratome (myNeuroLab; Leica
Microsystems, Ltd, Milton Keynes, UK) into 0.5‑mm slices. The
parietal lobe cortex in the ischemic core area was selected for
analysis, and selected areas were processed by post‑fixation in
1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, dehydrated in graded ethanol and
then embedded in epoxy resin. Polymerization was performed
at 80˚C for 24 h. Blocks were sectioned using an PowerTome-PC

ultramicrotome (RMC, Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA) into ultrathin
sections (60‑70 nm), which were post‑stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate, and visualized using a Hitachi 7100
electron microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). For quantitative
analysis of the number of autophagosomes, ten fields of vision
for each rat (three rats in each group) were examined as previously described (27).
TUNEL assay. A TUNEL assay (Boster Biological Technology,
Ltd, Wuhan, China) was performed according to the

WU et al: AUTOPHAGIC MECHANISM OF ELECTROACUPUNCTURE

manufacturer's instructions. Brain sections were stained with
diaminobenzidine, counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with gradient alcohol, cleared with xylene and then
mounted with neutral resin. The reaction mixture was replaced
with PBS in the negative control. Normal nuclei were stained
blue and apoptotic nuclei were stained brownish‑black or brown.
Four sections were observed from each rat (magnification, x400)
and ten fields of vision (n=5) on each slide were counted. The
percentage of positive apoptotic nuclei in the total number of
cells per field was calculated and the mean value was taken to
be the apoptotic index of cerebral neurons.
Western blotting. Following reperfusion for 12 h, the ischemic
parietal lobe cortex supplied by the right MCAO and the corresponding area of sham‑operated rats were homogenized and
proteins were extracted using a lysis buffer (10 mM Tris‑Hcl,
pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 1% Triton X‑100; 0.1% SDS; 5 mM
EDTA; 1 mM PMSF; 0.28 U/ml aprotinin; 50 µg/ml leupeptin;
1 mM benzamidine; and 7  µg/ml pepstatin A) as previously
described (28). Protein concentrations were determined using
a spectrophotometer (UV‑2540; SHIMADZH Corp., Kyoto,
Japan). A 60  µg aliquot of protein from each sample was separated using 10% SDS‑PAGE and subsequently transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane (Shanghai Haoran Bio‑Technology
Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). The membranes were then incubated
with specific polyclonal antibodies against LC3 (#4108; 1:1,000;
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA), or Beclin 1
(#3738; 1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) at 4˚C over night,
and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase‑conjugated
goat anti‑rabbit secondary antibody (sc2004; 1:5,000; Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA)
at room temperature for 1 h. Immunoreactivity was detected
using enhanced chemiluminescent autoradiography (Bioroc
Pharmaceutical & Biotech Co., Ltd, Tianjin, China) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes
were reprobed with β‑actin (1:5,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) following stripping. Films were then
used for final determination of protein expression using Sigma
scan software (scanPDF15; Sigma‑Aldrich) and normalized to
the loading control.
Evaluation of infarct volume, brain water content and motor
deficits. Following reperfusion for 12 h, the motor deficits in
rats were evaluated in a blinded manner using a previously
described protocol (29) and were scored as follows: 0, Rats
behave normally; 1, rats cannot fully stretch their left front
leg; 2, rats turn around in a circle; 3, rats fall down to the left
side; 4, rats cannot move by themselves and lose consciousness. Following scoring, rats with >2 points were sacrificed by
anesthetization with sodium pentobarbital followed by decapitation, and the brains were dissected and sliced in a plastic
module (3‑mm) and then stained with 2% 2,3,5‑triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) for 30 min. The total wet weight of the
TTC‑stained brains was quantified using an electronic scale.
The wet red and white brain regions of the TTC‑stained brains
were collected separately. Infarct volume was analyzed using
five slices of 3‑mm coronal sections from each brain and calculated with the following formula: Infarct volume (%) = [(total
wet weight ‑ red weight)/total wet weight] x 100. The red and
white sections of these brains were then desiccated at 105˚C

4441

for 48 h until the weight was constant. The total weight of
the dried TTC‑stained brains was follows: Water content
(%) = [(wet weight‑dried weight)/wet weight] x 100 (30).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed
using a one‑way analysis of variance followed by a
Student‑Newman‑Keul's post hoc analysis. Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference between values.
Results
Autophagy is upregulated following I/R. In order to determine
the time‑dependent effects of I/R on autophagy, the expression
levels of the activated autophagy biomarker LC3 were detected
using western blot analysis and the number of autophagosomes
present were observed using transmission electron microscopic
at different time points following I/R. In addition, the ratio
of LC3‑II/LC3‑I was determined, which reflected the extent
of autophagosome formation. As shown in Fig. 2A, the ratio
of LC3‑II/LC3‑I in the ischemic cortex of adult rats for each
group were 0.19, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.34, respectively. The ratio at each
time‑point (6‑24 h) following I/R was significantly increased
compared to that of the sham group  (F=18.63, P=0.000),
with a maximal value at 12 h following I/R. Similarly, the
number of autophagosomes significantly increased at each
time‑point following I/R (F=48.44, P=0.000), and peaked at
12 h (Fig. 2B). Therefore 12 h post‑I/R was used for all subsequent experiments to further explore the potential autophagic
mechanism of EA pretreatment.
EA pretreatment decreases the autophagosome and
cerebral apoptosis 12 h after I/R. In order to examine the
direct effect of EA pretreatment on autophagy, transmission
electron microscopy was used to observe the morphological
changes of neurons in each treatment group. Neurons in
the cortex of the sham group appeared to be normal with
comparatively healthy endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria,
lysosomes and nuclei (Fig. 3A). By contrast, neurons in the
I/R 12 h group displayed an apparent disease morphology;
the neurons showed fragmented endoplasmic reticulum,
formation of numerous vacuoles in the cytoplasm and
condensation of chromatin. Numerous autophagosomes
(C‑shaped double‑membrane structures) and lysosomes with
engulfed cytoplasmic materials were observed. Neurons
in the EA+I/R 12 h group displayed mild injury, with a
number of normal organelles and nuclei observed; however,
autophagosomes remained present. Quantitative analysis
of the electron microscopy images showed that the number
of autophagosomes in EA+I/R 12 h group was significantly
decreased compared with that of the I/R 12 h group (0.098
and 0.05 autophagosomes per µm 2, respectively; P<0.05).
In order to determine the contribution of autophagic
mechanisms to the beneficial effect elicited through EA
pretreatment, a single i.c.v injection of the autophagy
inducer rapamycin (35 pmol) was administered at the onset
of reperfusion and its effects were examined. The results
showed that neurons in the rapamycin+EA+I/R 12 h group
exhibited injury comparable to that of the I/R 12 h group,

suggesting that rapamycin suppressed the beneficial effect of
EA pretreatment.
Furthermore, cerebral apoptosis was detected using a
TUNEL assay. As shown in Fig. 3B, cerebral apoptosis was
significantly increased in rats subjected to I/R 12 h compared
to that of the sham group, whereas EA pretreatment significantly inhibited I/R‑induced apoptosis (32.1 and 15.5%,
respectively; P<0.05). However, following administration
with 35 pmol rapamycin prior to the onset of reperfusion,
levels of cerebral apoptosis were comparable to that of
the I/R 12 h group, therefore attenuating the effects of EA
pretreatment.
These results therefore supported the hypothesis that EA
pretreatment exerted a protective effect during I/R through
suppression of neuronal autophagy.
EA pretreatment reduces the expression of I/R‑induced
autophagic marker proteins 12 h following IR. In order to
further investigate whether EA pretreatment affects autophagy,
western blot analysis was used to detect the expression levels
of autophagic marker proteins, LC3‑I, LC3‑II and Beclin‑1 in
the ischemic cortex of rats. As shown in Fig. 4A, the expression
levels of LC3‑II were low in sham group and high in the I/R 12 h
group. EA pretreatment markedly decreased the expression of
LC3‑II; however, rapamycin attenuated the inhibitory effect of
EA on LC3‑II. In addition, LC3‑I expression only fluctuated
marginally among the treatment groups, therefore the ratio of
LC3‑II/LC3‑I was quantified. EA pretreatment significantly
decreased the ratio of LC3‑II/LC3‑I compared with that of the

I/R 12 h group (0.55 and 0.87, respectively; P<0.05); however,
rapamycin inhibited the decreased ratio of LC3‑II/LC3‑I in the
EA+I/R 12 h group (0.85 and 0.55, respectively), with comparable results to that of the I/R 12 h group. As shown in Fig. 4B,
the effect of the treatment groups on Beclin‑1 expression was
comparable to that on LC3‑II expression. Beclin‑1 expression
was significantly upregulated following I/R and suppressed by
EA pretreatment; however, rapamycin attenuated the effects of
EA pretreatment on Beclin‑1 expression (F=8.86, P=0.000 vs.
EA+I/R 12 h group). These results therefore suggested that EA
pretreatment prevented I/R‑induced autophagy via downregulation of LC3‑II and Beclin‑1 expression.
Autophagy inducer rapamycin abolishes the neuro‑
protective effects of EA pretreatment. In order to explore the
contribution of autophagic mechanisms to the neuroprotection elicited by EA pretreatment, the effects of rapamycin on
infarct volume, water content and motor deficits induced by
EA pretreatment were examined (Fig. 5). In rats subjected to
I/R, extensive infarction was detected in the ipsilateral cerebral
cortical and subcortical areas over a series of brain sections.
EA pretreatment significantly reduced the infarct volume and
water content of rats in the I/R 12 h group, whereas administration of 35 pmol rapamycin abolished the protective effects of
EA pretreatment, as evidenced by the increased infarct volume
and water content (F=10.24/P= 0.001 and F=11.6/P=0.000,
respectively) (Fig.  5A and B). Furthermore, the effects of
EA pretreatment on I/R‑induced motor behavior deficits
were evaluated (Fig. 5C); motor deficits were scored using a

pretreatment (EA+I/R 12 h) resulted in a significant reduction
in motor deficits induced by I/R (F=6.253, P=0.007 vs. I/R
12 h group), while administration with rapamycin significantly
attenuated the beneficial effects of EA pretreatment on neurological motor deficits. These results supported the hypothesis
that EA pretreatment protected neurons against I/R through an
autophagic mechanism.
Discussion
EA is a novel combination of traditional acupuncture‑based
therapy and modern electrotherapy. EA is conducted by
inserting acupuncture needles into acupoints and then
altering electric stimulation parameters, including stimulation
frequency, current intensity, pulse width and pulse interval (31).
Therefore, the choice of acupoint and stimulation parameters
is important; based on meridian theory, the 'Baihui' acupoint
(one of the acupoints of Du merdian) was selected for use in
the present study as it receives projections from the motor and
sensory cortex, as well as from the anterior cerebral artery. In
addition, according to the results of a previous study, 'Baihui
acupoint (GV20)'‑stimulation with a density‑sparse wave of
2/15 Hz and an intensity of 1 mA for 30 min/day over five
consecutive days was reported to induce cerebral I/R tolerance (32). Evidence has suggested that I/R disturbs energy
metabolism, increases oxidative stress and triggers apoptotic cell death (33). Previous studies have reported that EA
pretreatment exerted neuroprotective effects against I/R injury
via regulation of oxidative stress, maintenance of blood‑brain
barrier integrity and inhibition of apoptosis via various receptors (34,35). In addition, I/R was reported to induce autophagic
cell death (36,37); therefore, it is possible that EA pretreatment protected neurons against I/R injury through regulating

the levels of autophagy. The present study provided evidence
to suggest that the neuroprotective effect of EA pretreatment
was, at least in part, associated with the autophagy pathway.
Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved pathway, which
involves the isolation and transport of cytoplasmic materials
to lysosomes where proteins and organelles are degraded and
recycled. Under physiological conditions, autophagy activation has been associated with neuroprotection via degradation
of misfolded protein; for example, preconditioning ischemia
protects neurons against subsequent brain damage via upregulated autophagy  (38). However, under certain pathological
conditions, for example reperfusion following prolonged ischemia, autophagy overactivation promotes cell death through
apoptotic‑dependent and ‑independent cascades. A previous
study indicated that excess autophagy activation was involved
in several models of cerebral ischemia, including global
cerebral ischemia, focal ischemia and hypoxia‑ischemia,
through inducing autophagic cell death (39). Rami et al (23)
demonstrated that markedly elevated levels of autophagy
contributed to subsequent neuronal death in the penumbra
neurons of adults rats following focal cerebral I/R. In addition, Liu et al (40) reported that upregulation of LC3‑II was
associated with brain injury in post‑ischemic brain tissue
following global cerebral I/R. Furthermore, Xu  et al (41)
supported the association between significantly increased
levels of the autophagic marker proteins, LC3‑II and Beclin‑1,
and neuronal death in the ischemic cortex of mice following
focal cerebral I/R. Consistent with these studies, the results of
the present study demonstrated that the ratio of LC3‑II/LC3‑I
and Beclin‑1 expression in the ischemic cortex of adult rats
increased significantly following focal cerebral ischemia,
which may be associated with neuronal damage. These results
therefore indicated that autophagy levels may be associated
with neuronal fate.

WU et al: AUTOPHAGIC MECHANISM OF ELECTROACUPUNCTURE

The results of the present study demonstrated that EA
pretreatment exerted significant protective roles in a rat
model of focal cerebral ischemic model (MCAO), including
the reduction of cerebral apoptosis, infarct volumes and
brain edema, which in turn improved motor deficits. These
results were concurrent a previous report (7). Notably, the
protective effects of EA pretreatment were associated with
inhibition of the autophagy pathway, as evidenced by a
reduced number of autophagosomes in the ischemic parietal
lobe and the attenuated expression of the autophagy marker
proteins LC3‑II and Beclin‑1 at 12 h following I/R. These
results demonstrated that the neuroprotective effects of EA
pretreatment may be, in part, associated with the inhibition
of autophagy. Furthermore, the effects of the autophagy
inducer rapamycin (42) on the neuroprotective effects of EA
pretreatment were investigated. The results showed that the
neuroprotective effects induced by EA pretreatment were
partially reversed by rapamycin, which therefore suggested
that the inhibition of autophagic pathways may partially
underlie the mechanisms by which EA pretreatment induced
tolerance to cerebral I/R injury.
The role of autophagy in neuronal death during reperfusion
remains to be fully elucidated. Accumulating evidence has
suggested that autophagy activation contributed to ischemic
neuronal injury following cerebral I/R (25,43); however, one
study supported the opposite conclusion, that autophagy activation was associated with protective effects against neuronal
injury (44). For example, Zhang et al (44) evaluated the expression of the autophagic marker LC3‑II in the penumbral region
0, 1, 12, and 24 h post‑reperfusion and found that levels of
LC3‑II/GAPDH increased with reperfusion time, and persisted
until 24 h; however, the inhibition of autophagy during reperfusion enhanced I/R injury (44). The inconsistency may be due
to different ischemic models, durations of the ischemic insults
and ages of animals. It was reported that autophagy was more
pronounced in adult mice than neonatal mice subjected to
hypoxia‑ischemia injury, indicating that autophagic cell death
may be more significant in mature animals (45). Furthermore,
the different durations of the ischemic insults may affect the
role of autophagy during reperfusion.
In conclusion, the results of the present study suggested
that the neuroprotection induced by EA pretreatment against
I/R injury was mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of the autophagy pathway. Therefore, EA may provide
a promising novel strategy for the clinical treatment of I/R
injury.
