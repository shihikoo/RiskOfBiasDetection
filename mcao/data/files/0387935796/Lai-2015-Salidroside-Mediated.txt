Abstract Salidroside exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and anti-apoptotic properties. To identify whether salidroside might be a candidate for treating ischemic
stroke, we investigated the effects of salidroside or vehicle,
given daily for 6 days, after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h and reperfusion for either 1 or 48 h in
rats. Salidroside reduced cerebral infarct volume and significantly improved neurological scores whether started
after 1 or 48 h of reperfusion. Microarray analysis showed
that 20 % (133/678) of the genes down-regulated by ischemia and 1 h of reperfusion were up-regulated by salidroside, whereas 13 % (105/829) of the genes induced by
ischemia–reperfusion were inhibited by salidroside, suggesting that salidroside can reverse effects of ischemia–
reperfusion on gene expression. The main enriched functional categories induced by salidroside were genes related
to synaptic plasticity, whereas salidroside inhibited genes
related to inflammation. Induction of Egr1, Egr2, Egr4, and
Arc by salidroside was confirmed by qRT-PCR and western blotting in ischemic brains treated after either 1 or 48 h
of reperfusion. The potential protective role of Egr4 in
salidroside-mediated neuroprotection was subsequently

investigated in CoCl2-treated PC12 cells. Egr4 was dosedependently induced by salidroside in PC12 cells, and
depleting Egr4 with target-specific siRNA increased caspase-3 activity and Bax, but decreased Bcl-xl, which were
reversed by salidroside. Finally, we confirmed that salidroside inhibited the Bax/Bcl-xl-related apoptosis after
MCAO with reperfusion. In conclusion, salidroside is
highly neuroprotective with a wide therapeutic time window after ischemia–reperfusion injury in the rat, and this
partially involves induction of Egrs, leading to inhibition of
Bax/Bcl-xl-related apoptosis.

Introduction
The pathophysiological profile of ischemic stroke includes
interruption of cerebral blood flow, leading to energy depletion, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal cell death
by necrosis or apoptosis (Muresanu et al. 2012). However,
despite progress in our understanding, effective pharmacological treatments of ischemic stroke are still lacking. In
the last two decades, more than 100 agents have been
tested in clinical trials for their ability to reduce infarct size
and, hence, improve clinical outcome (Goldstein 2007;
Muresanu et al. 2012; Smith 2004). Nevertheless, tissuetype plasminogen activator remains the only FDAapproved drug for the treatment of ischemic stroke,
although it is only effective in 3–5 % of patients due to its
narrow therapeutic time and safety window (Goldstein
2007; Muresanu et al. 2012; Smith 2004). Thus, there is a
critical need for the development of novel treatments of
ischemic stroke.

Neurotox Res (2015) 28:108–121

Early growth response proteins (Egrs), a family of zinc
finger transcription factors that include Egr1, Egr2, Egr3,
and Egr4, are induced during neuronal activity and associated with synaptic plasticity (Bozon et al. 2003; DeSteno
and Schmauss 2008; Williams et al. 1995). Egr transcripts
are also increased in response to neuroprotective agents
such as erythropoietin (EPO) and hypothermia after focal
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in the rat (Mengozzi
et al. 2012; Ohta et al. 2007), and they are associated with
neuronal survival in global cerebral ischemia in gerbils
(Honkaniemi and Sharp 1996). In contrast, it has been reported that Egr1 induces apoptosis of rat cerebellar granule
neurons via transactivation of Bim gene expression (Xie
et al. 2011). Thus, the roles of Egrs in neuronal cell survival need further investigation.
Salidroside [2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl b-D-glucopyranoside, PubChem CID: 159278] is a bioactive component of Rhodiola rosea (Spasov et al. 2000). Salidroside
is known to have anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and
anti-apoptotic effects in in vitro and in vivo. It exhibits
anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects on PC12 and
SH-SY5Y cells following hypoglycemia and hydrogen
peroxide insults (Yu et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2007), and
it exerts antioxidant effects on hematopoietic stem cells
through a mechanism that involves activation of poly
(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (Li et al. 2012). It attenuates
myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury in rabbits via
activation of PI3K/Akt signaling (Xu et al. 2013), and it
improves homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction
in rats via a reduction in oxidative stress (Leung et al.
2013). Salidroside also reduces brain tissue loss, neuronal damage, and apoptosis following cerebral impact
injury in mice (Chen et al. 2012), and rescues hippocampal neurones in rats exposed to the cytotoxic agent
streptozotocin (Qu et al. 2012). In addition, animals preconditioned with salidroside exhibit smaller cerebral
infarct volumes and lower neurological deficit scores
after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and
reperfusion (Shi et al. 2012). However, the therapeutic
time window and the underlying mechanisms of any
effects of salidroside when administrated postoperatively
to MCAO animals are unknown. Addressing these
questions will help identify whether salidroside might be
a candidate for the treatment for ischemic stroke. We
therefore examined cerebral infarct volume, neurological
deficit score, neuronal apoptosis, and gene expression
profiles in the ischemic brains of rats given daily postoperative salidroside, or placebo, for 6 days after MCAO
with reperfusion for either 1 or 48 h. The potential
protective role of Egr4, one of the genes up-regulated by
salidroside, was subsequently investigated in CoCl2treated PC12 cells.

Materials and Methods
Animals
A total of 138 male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing
220 ± 20 g (7–8 weeks old) were purchased from the Slac
Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The animals were housed in groups of 5 rats/cage under controlled
temperature (21–23 °C) and humidity (55–75 %) conditions, with a 12-h light/dark cycle, and acclimatized to for
7–10 days prior to surgery. Food and water were provided
ad libitum throughout the study.
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance
with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The
protocol for this study was approved by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of Fujian University of Traditional
Chinese Medicine.
Stroke Model, Neurological Deficit Scoring,
and Drug Treatments
The animals were weighed before surgery and every day
thereafter. Transient MCAO was conducted as described
previously with some modifications (Kiyota et al. 1993).
Briefly, the animals were anesthetized with 10 % chloral
hydrate (3 ml kg-1). A silicone-coated nylon monofilament was inserted from the left common carotid artery to
the origin of the middle cerebral artery. After 2 h of occlusion, reperfusion was induced by withdrawing the filament. Sham animals were operated on in the same manner
except that the middle cerebral artery was not occluded.
During the operation, animals’ body temperatures were
monitored continuously and maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C
with a heat lamp and a heating pad.
Behavioral neurological deficit testing was performed
1 h after reperfusion and daily thereafter. Neurological
deficit (Longa et al. 1989) was scored by blinded observers
according to the following five-point scale: 0, no neurological deficit; 1, failure to extend the left forepaw fully; 2,
circling to the left; 3, unable to bear weight on the left side;
and 4, no spontaneous walking and/or complete immobility. In a pilot study, we monitored regional cerebral
blood flow (rCBF) during MCAO using a laser Doppler
flowmeter (AD Instruments, Australia). We found that our
technique produced a [70 % decrease from baseline of
rCBF after insertion of the occluding filament and a[60 %
recovery after filament withdrawal, and that these changes
were associated in the MCAO animals with a neurological
deficit score of C2, 1 h after the start of reperfusion. We
therefore subsequently selected a neurological deficit score
of \2 at 1 h after reperfusion as exclusion criteria to

123

110

exclude any animals in which MCAO might have been
ineffective.
In our main study, 96 animals were subjected to
MCAO and 36 rats were sham operated. MCAO rats with
neurological deficit scores of 2–4 were randomly assigned
to our experiments. Animals received vehicles (saline) or
50 mg kg-1 salidroside intraperitoneally once daily for 6
days, commencing 1 h (Groups 1, 2, 3) or 48 h (Groups
4, 5, 6) after reperfusion. Groups 1 and 4 were shamoperated rats that received vehicle (n = 12/group).
Groups 2 and 5 were MCAO rats that received vehicle
(n = 22 and 23, respectively). Groups 3 and 6 were
MCAO rats that received salidroside (n = 22/group).
After 6 days, 12, 16, 17, 12, 16, and 16 animals had
survived in Group 1–6, respectively. A further shamoperated group (n = 12) was treated with 50 mg kg-1
salidroside intraperitoneally, starting 1 h after operation
and continued for 6d. All surviving animals in each group
were then sacrificed. For determination of infarct size by
histology and TUNEL assays, brains from 6 animals of
each group were perfusion-fixed with a mixture of 40 %
formaldehyde, glacial acetic acid, and methanol (1:1:8 by
volume) under a constant pressure of 110 mmHg, and
then dissected and embedded in paraffin, as previously
described (Nakayama et al. 1988; Belayev et al. 1996).
Left cerebral hemispheres from the remaining animals
were dissected, 3 of which from each group were frozen
at -80 °C for protein extraction and the others were kept
in RNAlater (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) for
RNA extraction.
Assessment of Infarct Volume
Total cerebral volume and infarct volume were determined
from coronal 10 lm sections cut from paraffin-embedded
brains using a microtome (Thermo Scientific HM325), at
2 mm intervals throughout each brain except that sections
were taken at 1 mm intervals from bregma ?2 mm to
bregma -3 mm, the region of the main infarct, as described by Fujimoto et al. (2008). Sections were stained
with 0.1 % cresyl violet (Leagene, Beijing) for 10 min
followed by quick differentiation in 1 % glacial acetic acid/
70 % ethanol, dehydration, and mounting. The infarct area
that was defined as the unstained region, the right hemisphere area, and the left hemisphere area in each section
was measured using a digital medical image analysis system (Motic Med 6.0, Motic China Group, Xiamen, China).
The volume was calculated as the integrated product of the
cross-sectional area and the inter-sectional distance. The
effect of edema on apparent infarct volume was corrected
as described previously (Belayev et al. 1996), using the
formula below:

123

Neurotox Res (2015) 28:108–121

Corrected Infarct volume (%) = Right hemisphere volume - (left hemisphere volume - measured infarct volume)/right hemisphere volume 9 100 %.
TUNEL Staining
Apoptotic cells were detected in the section (5 lm) adjacent to the ones used for Nissl staining, using a DeadEndTM
Fluorometric TUNEL System kit in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Wisconsin). The
labeled cells were observed under a laser confocal microscope (ZEISS LSM710), with a 488-nm excitation light,
and cells emitting green fluorescence in their nuclei were
considered apoptotic. The average number of apoptotic
cells across five random visual fields (2009 magnification)
per section in the peri-infarct zone was recorded by a
blinded observer.
RNA Extraction, RNA Labeling, and Array
Hybridization
Ischemic cerebral hemispheres were individually homogenized in TRIzol (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY). Total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy Mini Kit,
in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Three individual RNA samples
from each group (sham-operated, untreated MCAO with
1 h of reperfusion, or MCAO with 1 h of reperfusion ? salidroside) were submitted to microarray analysis
on an Agilent Array platform (9 samples in total). Sample
preparation and microarray hybridization were performed
according to the manufacturer’s standard protocols (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA).
Microarray Data Analysis
Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 11.0.1.1) was
used to analyze array images. Quantile normalization and
subsequent data processing were performed using the GeneSpring GX v12.0 software package (Agilent Technologies).
After quantile normalization of the raw data, genes that were
flagged in all samples were chosen for further analysis. Genes
whose expression levels differed significantly (1.5-fold
change, p \ 0.05, Student’s t test) between two groups (sham
vs. MCAO or MCAO vs. MCAO ? salidroside) were identified through volcano plot filtering (Li 2012). Functional
annotation and biological term enrichment analysis was carried out with reference to the DAVID database, using a significance threshold of p \ 0.01 (Huang et al. 2009). Our
microarray results were deposited in the public database
NCBI GEO: GSE52001 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE52001.

Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase
Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)

Transfection of Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)
into PC12 Cells

First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA in
the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). cDNAs were quantified by
PCR using SYBR Green real-time PCR master mix (Life
Technologies), as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
GAPDH was used as an internal control. Results were
expressed as fold change relative to sham control, after
normalization to GAPDH. The sequences of PCR primers
are available upon request.

Either one of two Egr4-targeted siRNA sequences (Qiagen,
Cat# SIO1509025 & SIO1509032), AllStars Control
siRNA (Qiagen) or vehicle alone, was transfected into
CoCl2-treated cells, using RNAi Human/Mouse Starter Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Both Egr4-targeted siRNA sequences specifically depleted
Egr4 expression (data not shown), and the Egr4-targeted
siRNA sequence (Cat# SIO1509025) was used for subsequent experiments.
CoCl2-treated cells were treated in 4 groups. One group
was transfected with 10 pM Egr4-targeted siRNA sequence, the second received only 10 lM salidroside, the
third received a combination of 10 pM Egr4-targeted
siRNA with 10 lM salidroside, and the fourth received
only vehicles. A group of cells that received vehicles
without CoCl2 treatment was also included. After 48 h of
treatment, cells were harvested for caspase-3 activity assay,
RT-PCR, and western blot analysis.

Western Blot Analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as described previously, with some modifications (Hong et al. 2003). Briefly,
protein samples from mitochondria isolated using a Tissue
Mitochondria Isolation Kit or a Cell Mitochondria Isolation
Kit (Beyotime, China), or from total cell lysates, were
separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with the following
antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Dallas, TX)—anti-Egr1 antibody (1:600 dilution), antiEgr2 antibody (1:800 dilution), anti-Egr4 antibody (1:800
dilution), and anti-Arc antibody (1:600 dilution)—or with
the antibodies from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA)—anticaspase-3 antibody (1:1000 dilution) or anti-cleaved-caspase-3 antibody (1:1000 dilution). The blots were stripped
and re-probed with anti-b-actin antibody (1:1000 dilution,
Cell Signaling) or with mitochondrial loading control antiCox IV antibody (1:1000, Abcam, UK).
Images of western blots were captured using a ChemiDoc XRS ? imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and
the target protein bands were analyzed with Image J software. b-actin was used as an internal loading control. The
results are expressed as fold changes relative to shamoperated controls after normalization of the data to b-actin.
Cell Culture and Treatments of Cells
Rat PC12 cells (American Type Culture Collection,
ATCC) were maintained and cultured in accordance with
the supplier’s instructions. Cells were seeded in 6-well
plates (1 9 105 cells/plate), and chemically induced hypoxia was performed following the protocol described
previously with modifications (Hu et al. 2010). Briefly,
cells were incubated with vehicle or salidroside at the
indicated concentrations in the presence of 200 lM CoCl2
for 48 h, and then harvested for western blot analysis or for
caspase-3 activity assay using Caspase-3 Activity Assay
Kit (Cell Signaling).

Statistical Analysis
The data are presented as means ± standard errors of the
mean (SEMs) and were analyzed using one-way ANOVA
followed by multiple comparisons with post hoc Bonferroni testing (SPSS 8.0). Neurological deficit scores were
analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U test. A p value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Infarction and Neurological Deficit Scores
Nissl staining showed that neuronal injury was most extensive in the cortices of ischemic brains. This is consistent
with previous findings that longer periods of MCAO, such
as the 120 min occlusion used in the present experiments,
cause extensive infarction in the cortex as well as in subcortical structures (Belayev et al. 1996). Nissl staining also
showed that the infarct volume was significantly reduced
by salidroside treatment whether started after a period of 1
or 48 h of reperfusion (Fig. 1a, b). In addition, Nissl
staining revealed no infarcts in the brains of the shamoperated animals, whether these were treated with placebo
or with salidroside (Online Resource 1). Salidroside treatment gradually improved neurological deficit scores after
MCAO and reperfusion. After 6 days, salidroside significantly improved neurological deficit scores whether
commenced after 1 h or 48 h of reperfusion (Fig. 1c, d).

Identification of Genes Regulated by Salidroside
in Ischemic Brain Injury
Next, we examined the effects of salidroside treatment on
cerebral gene expression profiles. Without salidroside,
MCAO and 1 h of reperfusion significantly up-regulated
829 genes and significantly down-regulated 678 genes
compared to sham-operated animals (Online Resources
2&3). Salidroside treatment of MCAO rats after 1 h of
reperfusion significantly enhanced 209 transcripts (Online

123

Resource 4), of which 133 were from genes downregulated by ischemia–reperfusion injury (Online Resource
5). These significantly up-regulated genes included Egr1,
Egr2, Egr4, and Arc. Salidroside also significantly inhibited 159 transcripts (Online Resource 6), of which 105
derived from genes up-regulated by ischemia–reperfusion
injury (Online Resource 7). These significantly downregulated genes included CD44, CD14, C1s, Ccr5, and
A2m, which are involved in inflammatory responses. Only
1 of the 678 transcripts down-regulated by MCAO with 1 h

Neurotox Res (2015) 28:108–121

113

of reperfusion was further reduced by salidroside treatment. None of the 829 genes up-regulated by cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury were further induced by
salidroside. Thus, 20 % (133/678) of the genes downregulated after ischemia and 1 h of reperfusion were upregulated again by salidroside, whereas 13 % (105/829) of
the genes induced by ischemia–reperfusion were inhibited
by salidroside, suggesting that salidroside can reverse effects of ischemia–reperfusion on gene expression.
Analysis employing DAVID functional annotation of
the genes that were up-regulated by salidroside treatment
of rats subjected to MCAO and 1 h of reperfusion showed
that the top-ranking enriched categories were genes concerned with ‘‘regulation of neuronal synaptic plasticity,’’
‘‘regulation of synaptic transmission,’’ and ‘‘regulation of
neurological system process,’’ including the genes such as
Egr1, Egr2, Arc, and Vgf (all p \ 0.01; Table 1). The main
genes down-regulated by salidroside after MCAO and 1 h
of reperfusion were genes involved in ‘‘copper ion binding’’ including the genes Sparc, Mt1a, Heph,Cp, and Afp;
‘‘inflammatory responses’’ including the genes CD14,
CD44, C1s, Ccr5, Scn9a, and A2m; and ‘‘responses to
wounding’’ including the genes CD14, CD44, C1s, Ccr5,
Scn9a, A2m, Arg1, Lamb2, and Sparc (all p \ 0.01;
Table 1).
Validation of Expressions of Egr1, Egr2, Egr4,
and Arc in Ischemic Brain
Expressions of Egr1, Egr2, Egr4, and Arc were selected for
further validation, as these genes are known to be significantly associated with synaptic plasticity and are induced in ischemic brain by EPO and hypothermia
(Mengozzi et al. 2012; Ohta et al. 2007). qRT-PCR results
demonstrated that Egr1, Egr2, Egr4, and Arc were downregulated in ischemic brains compared to sham, and this
ischemic effect was reversed in MCAO rats treated with
salidroside commencing 1 h after reperfusion (Fig. 2a–d).
Western blot analysis showed that the protein levels of

Egr1, Egr2, Egr4, and Arc were reduced in the untreated
MCAO group compared to the levels observed in the shamoperated group, but normalized in the salidroside-treated
MCAO group (Fig. 2a–d), in parallel to the mRNA levels
from these genes. In contrast, salidroside did not alter the
expressions of Egr1, Egr2, Egr4, and Arc in sham-operated
rats (Online Resource 8).
Expressions of Egr1, Egr2, Egr4, and Arc were also
investigated in ischemic brain from the animals received
salidroside for the first time after 48 h of reperfusion. The
mRNA and protein levels of these genes were also downregulated in the untreated MCAO and 48 h reperfusion
group compared to that in the sham-operated controls, but
were still normalized if salidroside treatment was started
even at the end of the 48 h reperfusion period (Fig. 3a–d).

Salidroside-Induced Egr4 is Associated with its
Anti-apoptotic Effects in CoCl2-Treated PC12 Cells
As the effects of Egrs on apoptosis of neuronal cells are
either controversial (e.g., Egr1 & Egr2) (Honkaniemi and
Sharp 1996; Mengozzi et al. 2012; Ohta et al. 2007; Xie
et al. 2011) or have not been studied (e.g., Egr4), we investigated the action of Egr4 in CoCl2-treated PC12 cells.
CoCl2 treatment significantly increased caspase-3 activity,
and decreased the protein levels of both Egr4 and Egr1 in
PC12 cells, and all of these effects were dose-dependently
reversed by salidroside (Fig. 4a–c).
When CoCl2-treated PC12 cells were transfected with
an Egr4-targeted siRNA, the mRNA and protein levels of
Egr4 were decreased (Fig. 5a, b) and the cells developed
significantly higher caspase-3 activity (Fig. 5c) compared
to cells transfected with a control siRNA. This pro-apoptotic effect of Egr4-targeted siRNA was associated with
increases of Bax and decreases of Bcl-xl protein in mitochondria (Fig. 5d). All of these pro-apoptotic effects were
reversed by salidroside (Fig. 5c, d). These results suggested that the induction of Egr4 by salidroside may play a

Apoptosis in Ischemic Brain
We then investigated whether salidroside inhibits the Bax/
Bcl-xl-related mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in ischemic brains. Whether the sham-operated animals were

123

treated with placebo or with salidroside, no TUNEL-positive cells were detected in the cerebral region that corresponds to the infarcted region in MCAO rats (Online
Resource 9). In contrast, salidroside significantly reduced
the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the peri-infarct
zone of MCAO rats with 1 h of reperfusion (Fig. 6). At the
same time, salidroside did not affect total caspase-3 protein
expression but did markedly decrease the level of the
cleaved, activated form of caspase-3 (Fig. 7a). Moreover,

mitochondrial Bax was increased in MCAO rats after 1 h
of reperfusion, and this increase was abolished by salidroside (Fig. 7b). In contrast, mitochondrial Bcl-xl was
decreased in the MCAO rats, and this decrease was abolished by salidroside (Fig. 7b). Similar inhibition of the
Bax/Bcl-xl-related pathway of apoptosis by salidroside was
also observed in ischemic brain of MCAO rats with 48 h of
reperfusion (data not shown).

Discussion
The present study demonstrates that treatment with salidroside markedly reduced cerebral infarct volume and
significantly improved neurological function in rats injured
by 2 h of MCAO followed by reperfusion. Oxygen-free
radicals and other mechanisms triggered by reperfusion
after cerebral ischemia produce cumulative neuronal

after reperfusion for 1 h or even after reperfusion that had
continued for 48 h. Thus, our results, together with the
previous report that salidroside pre-conditioning reduces
brain injury in MCAO rats (Shi et al. 2012), indicate that
salidroside is effective for the treatment of cerebral ischemia with reperfusion injury over a wide therapeutic
time window extending from pre-conditioning before the
injury to for periods of up to at least 48 h of reperfusion. A
wide therapeutic time window is an important prerequisite
for agents that might be used clinically because of the
uncertainty over reperfusion times after cerebral ischemia
in patients. In this regard, therefore, salidroside, or other
agents that share its mechanisms of action, fulfills an important criterion of potential therapeutics for clinical ischemic stroke.
Microarray analysis drew attention to a variety of genes
responding to salidroside and therefore, potentially, to its
mechanisms of action. Generally, salidroside prevented or
reversed many of the effects of ischemia–reperfusion on
gene expression. Thus, 20 % (133/678) of the genes downregulated by ischemia–reperfusion were up-regulated again
by salidroside. Conversely, 13 % (105/829) of genes induced by ischemia–reperfusion were inhibited by salidroside treatment. Of course, the expression levels of mRNA
expression do not necessarily correlate to protein levels or
to enzymic activity, and this may explain why no core
component of the apoptosis machinery was identified as
responding to salidroside by microarray analysis, although
we found that salidroside inhibited apoptosis in ischemic
brain. Nevertheless, we found that salidroside clearly
modulates transcription of several relevant classes of genes, including those involved in synaptic plasticity and
inflammation. The increases in the expressions of Egr1,
Egr2, Egr4, and Arc we observed caused by salidroside are
particularly interesting given the well-documented roles of
these genes in neuronal synaptic plasticity (Bozon et al.
2002, 2003; DeSteno and Schmauss 2008; Williams et al.
1995). The immediate early gene Arc is a master regulator
of synaptic plasticity, involved in maintaining LTP and
consolidation of long-term memory (Guzowski et al. 2000;
Shepherd and Bear 2011), and is highly responsive to synaptic activity and can also be induced by Egr1 or Egr3 (Li
et al. 2005). Hence, our data support the notion that salidroside could enhance synaptic plasticity after ischemic
brain injury through involvement of Egrs and Arc.
We further investigated a potential protective role for
Egrs using CoCl2-treated PC12 cells. Both hypoxia and
CoCl2 stimulate the levels of erythropoietin (EPO)
through a common pathway, probably involving the same
conformational change in an upstream O2-sensing heme
protein in Hep3B cells (Goldberg et al. 1988). In addition,
CoCl2, like hypoxia, induces hypoxia-inducible factor-1
(HIF-1) expression, and this has been used to model

hypoxic responses in HepG2 and Hep3B (Piret et al.
2002; Chandel et al. 1998; Jiang et al. 1997). Similarly,
exposure to CoCl2 is known to trigger a spectrum of
hypoxia-related responses in PC12 cells, including induction of HIF-1a protein levels, induction of mitochondrial DNA damage, and increased generation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis (Hartwig et al. 2014;
Hu et al. 2010; Kotake-Nara et al. 2005; Wang 2000;
Wang et al. 2001, 2009; Zou et al. 2001). We also confirmed in the present study that CoCl2 mimicked important cellular responses that otherwise characterize the

response of PC12 cells to hypoxia. Thus, treatment of
PC12 cells with CoCl2 in vitro induced caspase-3 activity
and Bax expression, inhibited expressions of Bcl-xl and
Egrs, and caused apoptosis, and that all of these effects
were paralleled in vivo by ischemia/reperfusion injury. It
is also consistent with the idea that treatment with CoCl2
can model responses to hypoxia, in which we found that
salidroside reversed all of these hypoxia-related proapoptotic effects in both CoCl2-treated PC12 cells in vitro
and in vivo after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Moreover,
we showed, using specific RNAi, that the up-regulation of

Egr4 by salidroside can reduce apoptosis in PC12 cells
exposed to CoCl2 and that, therefore, the up-regulation of
Egr4 by salidroside may at least partly explain the neuroprotective effects of salidroside. Up-regulation of Egrs
has already been associated with the efficacy of other
neuroprotective agents, such as EPO and hypothermia, in
studies of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion in rats (Mengozzi
et al. 2012; Ohta et al. 2007), and these results, taken
together with our in vitro results directly implicating Egr4
in salidroside-mediated neuroprotection, strongly suggest
that the in vivo up-regulation of Egr4 caused by salidroside is at least partly responsible for the

123

neuroprotective effects of salidroside in cerebral ischemia/
reperfusion injury.
Salidroside inhibition of apoptosis is associated with
decrease of mitochondrial Bax and increase of mitochondrial Bcl-xl in CoCl2-treated PC12 and in ischemia/reperfusion brain, which are in good agreement with a previous
report that salidroside inhibits the Bax/Bcl-2-related mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in cerebral impact injury
(Chen et al. 2012). Salidroside-mediated inhibition of the
Bax/Bcl-xl-related mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis
may depend at least partially on the induction of Egrs.
Further investigations are required to understand the

precise role of Egr4 and other Egrs in salidroside-mediated
neuroprotection in vivo. Nevertheless, our results report for
the first time that induction of Egr4 could contribute significantly to the mechanisms of the robust neuroprotective
effects of salidroside in various in vitro and in vivo experimental models.
The observations that the transcript levels of Egrs and
Arc were significantly reduced in ischemic brains 6 days
after reperfusion, compared to the sham group, contrast
with previous studies showing the rapid induction of these
genes following brain ischemia (Honkaniemi and Sharp
1996; Mengozzi et al. 2012). This discrepancy could be
due to the different time points tested. Indeed, we have
observed that Egr1, Egr2, Egr4, and Arc mRNA levels
were increased markedly 1 h after reperfusion, and then
progressively decreased at 4, 8, 24 h, and 6 days after
reperfusion (data unpublished).
Microarray analysis also revealed that salidroside
treatment inhibited a group of genes associated with inflammation such as CD14, CD44, C1s, Ccr5, and A2m.
The expression of these genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR
(data not shown). Inflammation plays a critical role in the
pathophysiology of stroke (Jin et al. 2010). CD44, the
mRNA of which was down-regulated by salidroside, is a
cell-surface glycoprotein involved in lymphocytic activation and cytokine production. CD44 is induced in microglia, macrophages, and microvessels by cerebral
ischemia in rats and could play a role in cerebral

inflammation and remodeling (Wang et al. 2001). Moreover, CD44 deficiency protects mice from cerebral ischemia (Wang et al. 2001, 2002). CD14 is another gene
that was down-regulated by salidroside. CD14 is a coreceptor with toll-like receptor 4, detecting bacterial
lipopolysaccharide, reactive oxygen species, and other
triggers to enhance inflammation (Zhou et al. 2013). CD14
is predominately expressed in microglia in the CNS and
contributes to neuroinflammatory responses in brain diseases, including cerebral ischemia (Beschorner et al. 2002).
Therefore, the reduced expression of these inflammatory
genes by salidroside could contribute to its neuroprotective
properties. We are currently investigating whether the reduced expression of these inflammatory genes is associated
with Egrs induced by salidroside.
In summary, our study provides evidence that salidroside is highly neuroprotective across a wide therapeutic
time window of reperfusion after MCAO in the rat. Salidroside has the ability to reverse many effects of ischemia–
reperfusion on gene expression, including the ability to reinduce a group of genes, Egr1, Egr2, Egr4, and Arc, associated with synaptic plasticity. In addition, we establish
that Egr4 can prevent apoptosis in an in vitro model of
oxidative neuronal damage and that its increased expression could contribute to salidroside-mediated neuroprotection in ischemic brain. These findings suggest that
salidroside may be an attractive candidate to treat ischemic
stroke.
