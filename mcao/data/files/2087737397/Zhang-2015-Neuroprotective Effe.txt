Abstract Stroke is the second leading cause of death
among adults worldwide. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate
(EGCG) has been demonstrated to exhibit neuroprotective
functions in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the underlying mechanisms in this process and its
contribution to the protection function remain unknown.
The current study examined the neuroprotective effects of
EGCG after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
(tMCAO) in rats. tMCAO for 120 min was induced in male
Sprague-Dawley rats treated with EGCG (50 mg/kg, i.p.)
or Vehicle immediately after reperfusion. Neurological
score, infarct ratio and inflammation-related molecules
(assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, enzymelinked immunosorbent assays, quantitative real-time PCR
or western blotting) were estimated at 24 h after operation.
EGCG prevented the impairment of neurological function
and decreased the infarct volume, compared with the
Vehicle group. The inflammation-related molecules TNFa, IL-1b, IL-6 levels usually caused by ischemia/reperfusion were significantly ameliorated by EGCG. EGCG also
inhibited the upregulation of nuclear factor-kappa B/p65

Introduction
Stroke is considered as one of the leading causes of death
and disability around the world. In 2010, the absolute
numbers of people with first stroke (16.9 million), strokerelated deaths (5.9 million), stroke survivors (33 million),
and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost (102 million) were very high and had significantly increased since
1990 (68, 26, 84, and 12 % increase, respectively) [1]. To
date, few therapeutic options are available to treat stroke.
The importance of inflammatory mechanisms in stroke has
been well recognized [2, 3]. Ischemic stroke causes a
profound local and systemic inflammatory response [3].

123

And in acute ischemic stroke, inflammation appears to
contribute to ischemic pathology. Inflammation itself has
the potential to exacerbate the spread of damage to the
ischemic penumbra [4], and the expression of inflammation
cytokines that may contribute to ischemic injury [5, 6].
Anti-inflammatory strategy following ischemic stroke
remains a promising approach [7, 8].
(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a natural
polyphenol and a main constituent of green tea extract, has
neuroprotective effects in autoimmune encephalomyelitis,
spinal cord injury and Alzheimer’s disease through its antiinflammatory properties [9–12]. In gerbil model of brain
ischemia, EGCG (50 mg/kg, i.p.) reduced hippocampal
neuronal damage, protected the brain against brain edema
and lipid peroxidation [13, 14]. Through anti-oxidant
effects of EGCG in a rat model of transient focal ischemia,
the dose of 50 mg/kg of EGCG significantly reduced the
infarction volume and the neurological deficit total score,
attenuated the level of malondialdehyde and oxidized/total
glutathione ratio [15]. Wu et.al. [16] reported that EGCG
reduced cerebral infarction and improved learning and
memory deficits in partly by modulation of oxidative stress
in cerebral ischemic rats These experimental studies have
shown that the administration of EGCG is neuroprotective.
It is a promising method for the treatment of ischemic brain
disease. However, all previous studies mostly focused on
the antioxidant activity of EGCG, the precise mechanisms
of the neuroprotective effects of EGCG, such as anti-inflammatory mechanisms, are not entirely known. As far as
we know, few studies focused on the anti-inflammatory of
EGCG for the treatment of ischemic brain disease. As
mentioned, EGCG has a neuroprotective effect, through its
anti-inflammatory properties, and inflammation plays a
critical role in cerebral ischemia. Therefore, this study
was undertaken to demonstrate our hypothesis that EGCG
can prevent cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in an
experimental tMCAO rat model through attenuation of
inflammation.

Materials and Methods
Animals and Drug Treatment
This study used 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats [Sun YatSen University Laboratory Animal Center, Guangzhou,
China SCXK (Guangdong) 2011-0029], weighing 200 ±
20 g at the beginning of the experiment. Animals were
housed at 20 °C on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on from
8:00 to 20:00) with free access to water and standard rat
chow. Experiments were performed according to the
Guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocol was

123

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:1691–1698

approved by the Animal Experimental Committee of
Sun Yat-Sen University at Guangzhou, China [SYXK
(Guangdong) 2011-0112]. Rats were randomly assigned to
three groups: tMCAO with EGCG treatment (EGCG,
n = 16), tMCAO with no treatment (Vehicle, n = 16), and
sham operation (Sham, n = 16). After 120 min of occlusion, the two MCAO groups were reperfused. Immediately
after transient cerebral ischemia when reperfusion begins,
EGCG (50 mg/kg, i.p.; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) was
administered to the treatment group, because of 25 mg/kg
has no significant effects [17]. The Vehicle and Sham
control groups received an i.p. injection of an equivalent
amount of saline solution.
tMCAO Model
Ischemia was induced by left MCAO, as previously
described [18]. Briefly, rats were anesthetized with 10 %
chloral hydrate (3.5 ml/kg, i.p.), and body temperature was
maintained at 37 °C throughout the procedure using a
circulating heating pad. After a midline cervical incision,
the left common carotid artery was exposed and the
external carotid artery was ligated distally. A nylon
monofilament for MCAO (Shadong Biological Technology
Co., Ltd, Beijing, China, 2432-AAA) was advanced from
the external carotid artery into the lumen of the internal
carotid artery. After 120 min of cerebral ischemia, the filament was withdrawn to allow reperfusion. In the Sham
control group, rats underwent the same surgical procedure
except for the insertion of the filament into the carotid
artery. Twenty-four hours after tMCAO, animals were
killed, and their brains were removed.
Neurological Deficit Evaluation
To evaluate the impairment of neuronal function after
tMCAO, a neurological deficit grading system with a scale
of zero to five was performed on each animal as described
previously (n = 16 in each group) [19]: grade 0: normal
behavior; grade 1: rats exhibited contralateral forelimb
consistently flexed during the suspension from the tail;
grade 2: rats moved spontaneously in all directions but
exhibited a monodirectional circling toward the paretic
side; grade 3: rats exhibited a consistent spontaneous
contralateral circling; grade 4: rats were very weak and
walked only when stimulated; and grade 5: rats died by the
day of assessment. Higher scores indicated more severe
impairment of neuronal function.
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium Chloride Staining
Twenty-four hours after tMCAO, animals were killed, and
their brains were removed. The brains were then sliced into

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:1691–1698

seven coronal sections with 2-mm thickness each (n = 4–8
in each group). The sections were stained with 2 % TTC
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 20 min. The slices were
subsequently stored in 10 % phosphate-buffered formalin.
Infarct ratio was calculated by BI-2000 Medical Image
Analysis System (Chengdu TME Technology Co., Ltd,

100 mg ischemic cerebral cortex was rinsed with 19 PBS,
homogenized in 1 ml of 19 PBS and stored overnight at
-20 °C. After two freeze–thaw cycles, the homogenates
were centrifuged for 5 min at 50009g, 2–8 °C. The supernate was removed and assayed immediately. Protein content was assayed by the bicinchoninic (BCA) procedure.
Ischemic cerebral cortex concentrations of TNF-a, IL-6,
and IL-1b were measured using commercially available
quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) kits (Cusabio biotech Co., Ltd, Wuhan, China;
n = 8 in each group). The change in absorbance in each
well at 450 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer
(model ELx800, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT,
USA). Values of cytokine levels were expressed in terms of
picograms per milligram (pg/mg).

Ischemic cerebral cortex protein extracts were separated by
10 % (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto PVDF
membranes. After blocking with 5 % (w/v) nonfat dried
milk, membranes were incubated separately with primary
antibodies against at the appropriate dilution {COX-2
(1:1500 Boster Biological Technology Co., Ltd), INOS
(1:2000 Beijing Biosynthesis Biotechnology Co., Ltd), NFjB/p65 [1:1500 Cell Signaling Technology (CST)],
GAPDH (1:10,000 KangChen Bio-tech Inc.)} overnight at
4 °C. Membranes were incubated with horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies (HRP Goat anti-Rabbit IgG,
Boster Biological Technology Co., Ltd) at a dilution of
1:20,000 for 40 min at room temperature. The horseradish
peroxidase was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
(merck Millipore). Images were analyzed by using Bio5000 plus scanner provided by Microtek International, Inc.
The specific protein expression levels were normalized to
the GAPDH protein levels (n = 3 in each group).

the manufacturer’s instructions (TAKARA). Subsequently,
reverse transcription was performed using a high capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (DBI), followed by PCR

For statistical analysis, the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software
package was used (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA,

one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by
Tukey’s procedure for intergroup comparisons. A value of
P \ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Effects of EGCG on Neurological Scores and Infarct
Volume
Ischemia/reperfusion injury led to a deterioration neurological function in the Vehicle group, compared with the
Sham group. The impairment of neurological function by
ischemia/reperfusion was significantly less in the EGCGtreated group (50 mg/kg, neurological score: 2.44 ± 0.18,
P \ 0.01), compared with the Vehicle group (neurological
score: 3.63 ± 0.20, Fig. 1a,b. At 24 h after tMCAO, the
percentage of infarct volume in the 50 mg/kg EGCG group
(18.25 ± 2.03 %, P \ 0.01) was significantly smaller than
that in the Vehicle group (35.80 ± 3.20 %, Fig. 1c,d). To

To determine the effects of EGCG on the inflammatory
process in the post-ischemic brain, we observed levels of
cytokines in the ischemic regions in cortex using ELISA.
At 24 h after tMCAO, cortex levels of TNF-a, IL-1b and
IL-6 were significantly elevated in Vehicle group rats
compared to Sham group rats (n = 8, P \ 0.01, Fig. 2).
But in EGCG-treated group, cortex levels of TNF-a, IL-1b,
and IL-6 were all significantly lower compared to the
Vehicle group (n = 8, P \ 0.01, Fig. 2).

qRT-PCR is one of the most reliable and effective methods
for the quantification of variations in mRNA expression,
but the reliability of the results is strictly dependent on the
use of appropriate controls in the data normalization step.
Relative quantification procedure could lead to severe misinterpretation of the results. Therefore, we decided to validate, up to their expression stability, two of the most widely
used housekeeping genes were selected in this experiment.
Both housekeeping genes considered in this study (GAPDH,
b-actin) were classified as optimal controls and showed
stable expression in the cortex. To examine whether the
neuroprotective effect of EGCG were anti-inflammatory
mechanisms, we measured mRNA levels of NF-jB/p65,
iNOS, and COX-2 in the ischemic cortex at 24 h after
tMCAO. Ischemia/reperfusion injury significantly increased

area, and these beneficial effects were associated with
inhibition of inflammation-related pathways, such as inhibition of release of inflammatory factors, and suppression
of upregulation of COX-2, iNOS and NF-jB/p65 at both
the mRNA and protein levels.
It is established that inflammation is an important
pathological process of ischemic stroke, especially during
the acute phase [22]. TNF-a serves as a marker for activation of microglia and macrophages during cerebral
ischemia and other inflammatory reactions as reported
previously [23]. TNF-a levels showed an early and prolonged increase after stroke onset [24]. Patients with stroke
displayed statistically significant high levels of TNF-a in
cerebrospinal fluid and serum within the first 24 h [25].
TNF-a neutralization reduced cerebral edema through
inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase production after
transient focal cerebral ischemia [26]. Inhibiting TNF-a
may represent a novel pharmacological strategy to treat
ischemic stroke [27]. IL-1b is one of the most commonly
studied pro-inflammatory cytokines and has been shown to
increase following tMCAO. A promising novel therapeutic
approach is the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra),
which limits the action of the cytokine IL-1, a pivotal
mediator in the pathophysiology of acute neurodegeneration [4]. And there is already considerable preclinical and
clinical evidence that inhibition of IL-1 by IL-1ra may be
valuable in the management of acute stroke [28]. Many
experiments have shown that after tMCAO, IL-6 levels

Effects of EGCG on Protein Levels of NF-jB/p65,
iNOS, and COX-2
Representative western photographs for NF-jB/p65, iNOS,
and COX-2 were exhibited in top panels in Fig. 4. Compared with the Sham group, protein levels of NF-jB/p65,
iNOS and COX-2 in the ischemic cortex tended to be
higher in Vehicle group (P \ 0.01). Along with the results
of qRT-PCR, the expression of NF-jB/p65, iNOS and
COX-2 in western blotting (Fig. 4) was up-regulated in
Vehicle group which significantly reduced by treatment
with EGCG (P \ 0.05).

Discussion
Our studies showed that EGCG had a neuroprotective
effect in a transient focal ischemia model in agreement
with previous studies [13–16]. Treatment with EGCG
significantly reduced cerebral infraction at 120 min
ischemic occlusion and 22 h reperfusion. EGCG protected
against reperfusion injury after tMCAO, as shown by
suppression of neurological deficit and decreased infarct

increased in ischemic tissue [29, 30]. The release of
proinflammatory cytokines after focal cerebral ischemia
indicates a step leading to tissue necrosis or reflects the
amount of ischemic brain injury, since the higher concentration of IL-6 is found in patients with large infarctions
[31]. And compare 68 stroke patients admitted within 12 h
of symptoms onset and 71 controls, increased IL-6 concentration is present in early stroke period and are associated with a degree of neurological deficit and/or stroke
outcome [32]. Our study demonstrated that focal cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion injury provokes the release of cortex
TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6. This observation is consistent with
the results of previous studies. In cortex, TNF-a, IL-1b and
IL-6 levels were significantly increased as compared with
levels in Sham-operated rats. It suggested that these proinflammatory cytokines might be involved in reperfusion
injury after transient brain ischemia. Interestingly, the
range of elevation in cortex TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6 levels
was reduced in rats treated with EGCG. In conclusion,
EGCG treatment provides neuroprotection for rats with
focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. This protection
may be due to a decrease in the cortex levels of TNF-a, IL1b, and IL-6.NF-jB is a redox transcription factor located
within the cytoplasm and responsible for regulation in
cytokine production. When the pathway is activated,
phosphorylated NF-jB dimers are released and translocated to the nucleus, bind to the DNA sequences jB and
induce transcription of target genes [33]. In mammalians
the most abundant form is the p65/p50 heterodimer, p65contains a transcription activation domain, p50 does not
contain the transcription activation domain and is unable to
activate gene transcription after NF-jB activation [34]. So

the expression of NF-jB/p65 determines the activation of
NF-jB. NF-jB activation can promote apoptosis and cell
death in the nervous system [35–37]. In terms of inflammation, NF-jB activation has been shown to mediate
cytokine expression [38, 39] and iNOS induction [40] in
microglia. Furthermore, its activation is also involved in
COX-2 expression in activated astrocytes [41], a molecule
which mediates the formation of prostaglandin and seems
to play a significant role in the processes of neuroinflammatory. NF-jB activation has been observed in response to
brain ischemia. Mice lacking the p50 subunit develop
significantly smaller infarct size [42], and there are evidences that IKK/NF-jB signaling contributes to ischemic
brain damage [43], and promotes cell death in focal cerebral ischemia [44]. Many studies have proved that NF-jB
is an important transcription factor, it is responsible for the
transcription of many proteins including TNF-a, IL-1b and
IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2, that could mediate the deleterious
effects under ischemic conditions [5, 45]. On the other
hand, some data in hippocampus and striatum provide
evidences that NF-jB protects neurons from ischemic
injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. It
participates in survival signaling following temporary focal
ischemia [46]. Inhibition of NF-jB may reduce its neuroprotection activity. In our study, we used a rat model of
cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury to investigate the
neuroprotective effects of EGCG as well as the underlying
mechanisms by focusing on inflammatory response. EGCG
not only suppressed the expression of NF-jB/p65, but also
reduced COX-2 and iNOS inductions, which are produced
by NF-jB at both the mRNA and protein levels after 24 h
of ischemia/reperfusion injury, consequently decreased the

123

Neurochem Res (2015) 40:1691–1698

production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We supposed
that EGCG decrease the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFa, IL-1b and IL-6) through attenuation of NF-jB/p65
expression. The findings are consistent with the previous
reports [45]. Therefore, we suggest that inhibition of NFjB expression may be involved in the neuroprotective
effects of EGCG against reperfusion/ischemia injury,
through suppression of COX-2 and iNOS induction. Based
on the evidence, we suggest that EGCG can attenuate the
inflammatory response induced by ischemia–reperfusion
insult through inhibition of NF-jB in partly.
In conclusion, cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induces
multiple injury pathways including inflammatory reactions,
which then trigger the secondary brain damage cascade
leading to neurological deficits. By modulating inflammation with EGCG, especially the NF-kB signaling pathway,
eventually leading to better functional recovery and smaller
infarct volume. The neuroprotective effects of EGCG
appear to be associated with inhibition of NF-jB expression and consequent suppression of inflammatory response.
Further research is needed to explore the protective
mechanism of EGCG in detail.
