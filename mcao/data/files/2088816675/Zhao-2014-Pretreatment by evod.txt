Abstract Inflammatory damage plays an important role
in cerebral ischemic pathogenesis and may represent a
target for treatment. Evodiamine (Evo) has been proved to
elicit a variety of biological effects through its antiinflammatory property in the treatment of infectious disease, Alzheimer’s disease and hypoxia-induced inflammatory response. Whether this protective effect applies to
cerebral ischemic injury, we therefore investigated the
potential neuroprotective role of Evo and the underlying
mechanisms. Male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice
were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and randomly divided into five groups:
Sham (sham-operated ? 1 % DMSO ? 0.5 % tween80),
pMCAO (pMCAO ? 0.9 % saline), Vehicle (pMCAO ?
1 % DMSO ? 0.5 % tween80), Evo-L (Vehicle ? Evo
50 mg/kg) and Evo-H (Vehicle ? Evo 100 mg/kg) groups.
Evo was administered intragastrically twice daily for
3 days, and once again 30 min before mouse brain ischemia was induced by pMCAO. Neurological deficit, brain
water content and infarct size were measured at 24 h after
stroke. The expression of pAkt, pGSK3b, NF-jB and

claudin-5 in ischemic cerebral cortex was analyzed by
western blot and qRT-PCR. Compared with Vehicle group,
Evo significantly ameliorated neurological deficit, brain
water content and infarct size, upregulated the expression of
pAkt, pGSK3b and claudin-5, and downregulated the
nuclear accumulation of NF-jB (P \ 0.05). Evo protected
the brain from ischemic damage caused by pMCAO; this
effect may be through upregulation of pAkt, pGSK3b and
claudin-5, and downregulation of NF-jB expression.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke remains a major medical problem due to
the lack of effective treatment. Previous studies have
indicated that inflammatory response is an important
pathological mechanism in the pathogenesis of brain injury
secondary to ischemia [1–3]. The close relationship
between inflammatory response and cerebral ischemia has
generated our considerable interest in seeking anti-inflammatory therapies to combat ischemia-induced damage [2,
4–6].
Ample evidences have suggested that Protein kinase B
(PKB, also known as Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)
signaling pathway plays a central role in physical and pathological conditions to differently regulate inflammatory
factors as well as boost survival [7]. Akt, is a serine/threonine
kinase and plays a critical role in the modulation of cell
development, growth, and survival. Akt phosphorylation is
neuroprotective against ischemic injury. Akt is phosphorylated by its upstream kinases such as phosphoinositide
dependent kinase 1 (PDK-1), which phosphorylates Akt at

Neurochem Res (2014) 39:1612–1620

Thr308 [8] and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2
that phosphorylates Akt at Ser473 [9]. Thus Akt is fully
activated and then phosphorylates a diverse number of protein substrates including the constitutively active serinethreonine kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3-b (GSK3b)
(Ser9), I jB kinase (IKK), Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-jB)
and so on. GSK3b, which has been reported to be involved in
ischemic brain injury [10, 11], is particularly abundant in the
central nervous system and is neuron-specific. And it’s
activity has recently been identified in a number of studies as
crucial in the regulation of the inflammatory response [12].
NF-jB is a family of transcription factors composed of
five subunits, RelA/p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50 and p52 [13],
and previous observation provides evidence that GSK3b
regulated the inflammatory response by differentially
affecting the nuclear amounts of transcription factors NFjB subunit p65 [14]. Although NF-jB is essential for
neuron survival and its activation may protect neurons
against oxidative-stresses or ischemia-induced neurodegeneration, NF-jB activation can contribute to inflammatory reactions after brain injury and stroke [13, 15], which
regulates the genes of a vast number of inflammatory
mediators, such as IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a),
IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), all of which play a pivotal role in
ischemic brain damage [16–18]. Previous studies have
proved that NF-jB is activated in cerebral ischemia and
inhibition of NF-jB reduces infarction volume and develops less ischemic damage in permanent ischemia especially
[19–21].
Evodiamine (Evo) is an alkaloidal component extracted
from the unripe fruit of Evodiae-fructus which is commonly used as an anti-inflammatory drug in traditional
Chinese medicine. The structure of Evo is clear as shown
in Fig. 1. With respect to the pharmacological actions of
Evo, more attention has been paid to its beneficial effects
involving anti-inflammatory [22, 23], immune modulation
[24], anti-tumor [25–27] actions and retarding development
of atherosclerosis [28, 29]. Furthermore, Evo exerts a
protective effect on Alzheimer’s disease [23] and ischemia/
reperfusion damage in heart [30]. However, there is still a
paucity of data about the exact role of Evo on the brain

parenchymatous tissue in the acute phase of cerebral
ischemia.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether Evo has
neuroprotective effect on acute ischemic stroke, and the
potential mechanisms for its neuroprotection in permanent
middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) brain.

Materials and Methods
Experimental Animals
Male ICR mice (25–30 g, about 3 weeks, n = 120) were
supplied by Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology
Co. Ltd. The experimental protocol was approved by the
institutional animal care and use committee and the local
experimental ethics committee and conformed to internationally accept ethical standards. All mice were allowed to
acclimatize to the new surrounding for at least 2 days
ahead of any experimentation in a 12:12-h light/dark cycle.
Mouse Model of Permanent Focal Cerebral Ischemia
The procedure was performed as described previously [19,
31]. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with 10 % chloral
hydrate (350 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. In anesthetized
mice, body temperature was monitored and maintained at
36.5–37.5 °C. The right common carotid artery was
exposed and isolated. The right middle cerebral artery
(MCA) was occluded by inserting a monofilament nylon
suture with a heat-rounded tip into the internal carotid
artery, which was advanced further until it closed the origin
of the MCA. Sham-operated control mice received the
same surgical procedure without inserting a filament.
During the experiments, MCA blood flow was monitored
using a blood flow monitor (moor VMS-LDF, Moor
Instruments Ltd., UK) with a fiber optic probe, adhered
onto the skull surface of core area supplied by the MCA
before and after clamping the MCA.
Groups and Drug Administration
Evo (Zelang Medical Technology Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China)
with purity of more than 98 % was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and tween-80 to prepare concentration
of 5 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml. Evo was administered by
gavage twice a day (once every 12 h) for 3 days before
surgery and another dosage 30 min before operation. Sham
operated group: mice received equal volume 0.9 % saline
including 1 % DMSO and 0.5 % tween-80 (Sham);
pMCAO group: mice received pMCAO and treated with
equal volume 0.9 % saline (pMCAO); Vehicle group: mice
received pMCAO and treated with equal volume 0.9 %

saline including 1 % DMSO and 0.5 % tween-80 (Vehicle); low dose group: mice received pMCAO and treated
with Evo at dose of 50 mg/kg (Evo-L); high dose group:
mice received pMCAO and treated with Evo at dose of
100 mg/kg (Evo-H).

was calculated by the following formula [35]:
%HLV = {[total infarct volume - (the volume of intact
ipsilateral hemisphere - the volume of intact contralateral
hemisphere)]/contralateral hemisphere volume} 9 100 %.
Western Blotting

Neurological Function Assessment
A neurological test was carried out by an examiner blinded
to the experimental groups before the mice (n = 16 per
group) were killed at 24 h after pMCAO, following a
modified scoring system based on that developed from
Longa et al. [32] and our previous study [33, 34], as follows: (0) no deficits; (1) difficulty in fully extending the
contralateral forelimb; (2) unable to extend the contralateral forelimb; (3) mild circling to the contralateral side; (4)
severe circling; and (5) falling to the contralateral side. The
higher the neurological deficit score, the more severe
impairment of motor motion injury.
Measurement of Brain Water Content
Brain water content was observed at 24 h after pMCAO
using the standard wet-dry method. 6 mice in each group
were anesthetized with 10 % chloral hydrate and killed by
decapitation. The brains were quickly removed and placed
on a frozen surface. After dissecting free 2 mm of frontal
pole, a coronal brain slice (about 3 mm thick) was cut and
the slice was divided into the ipsilateral and contralateral
hemispheres. The two hemisphere slices packaged with
preweighed tin foil were immediately weighed on an
electronic balance to obtain the wet weight, dried for 8 h in
an oven at 120 °C, and then reweighed to obtain the dry
weight. Brain water content was calculated with the
equation as follows: Brain water content (%) = (wet
weight - dry weight)/wet weight 9 100 %.
Measurement of Infarct Volume
Infarct volume after pMCAO was determined by 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) at 24 h after pMCAO
(n = 6 per group). Animals were reanesthetized and the
brains were quickly collected. Then the brain tissue was
sliced into five coronal section (1.5 mm thick each) and
stained with 2 % solution of TTC at 37 °C for 15 min,
followed by fixation with 4 % paraformalde-hyde. The
normal tissue was stained red, while the infarct area was
stained a pale gray color. TTC-stained sections were photographed and the digital images were analyzed using
image analysis software (Image-Pro Plus 5.1). The lesion
volume was calculated by multiplying the area by the
thickness of slices. To compensate for the effect of brain
edema, the percentage hemisphere lesion volume (%HLV)

123

The cytosolic and nuclear protein and total protein were
extracted respectively from mouse ischemic and control
cortex following the manufacturer’s protocols (Applygen
Technologies Inc., Beijing, China) at 24 h after pMCAO.
About 30 mice were used for Western blot analysis (n = 6
per group). Protein concentration of the supernatant was
determined using a BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit
(Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) with bovine serum albumin
as the standard. An equivalent amount of 50 mg total
protein samples, as well as 30 mg cytosolic or nuclear
protein samples, was separated respectively, by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-poly-acrylamide gels prior and transferred
2 h on to PVDF membranes (Millipore Corporation, USA).
After blocking 1 h with 5 % non-fat dry milk in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS), membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-Akt
(1:500, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-pAkt (Ser473)
(1:500, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-GSK3b (1:500,
Bioworld Technology, lnc.), anti-pGSK3b (Ser9) (1:500,
Bioworld Technology, lnc.), claudin-5 (1:200, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-b-actin (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); rabbit monoclonal antibody NF-jB (p65) (1:500,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse monoclonal antibody anti-b-actin (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The
second day, membranes were washed with PBS containing
0.1 % Tween-20 (TPBS) (10 min 9 3) each time, and then
incubated with fluorescent labeling second antibodies
(IRDyeÒ 800-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
IgG, 1:5,000 dilution, Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) for 1 h
at room temperature. Membranes were then again washed
with TPBS (10 min 9 3) and the relative density of bands
was analyzed on an Odyssey infrared scanner (LI-COR
Bioscience, USA). The densitometric values were normalized with respect to the values of b-actin immunoreactivity to correct for any loading and transfer differences
between samples. This procedure was repeated 3 times
each sample.
Real-Time PCR
30 mice were used in this part (n = 6 per group). Total
mRNA was extracted by using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and was reverse-transcribed
into cDNA using Revert Aid first Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Fermentas International Inc, Burlington, Canada) for
Quantitative PCR (ABI7500, USA) in the presence of a

vehicle group. Compared with Vehicle group, the infarct
size was significantly reduced both in Evo-H and Evo-L
group (Vehicle group vs. Evo-H group: 43.90 ± 2.61 %
vs. 32.78 ± 3.78 %, P \ 0.05; Vehicle group vs. Evo-L

The results showed that systemic administration of Evo to
cerebral ischemic mouse significantly increased the
expression of pAkt and pGSK3b at protein level
(P \ 0.05). While the expression of Akt and GSK3b at
protein level was not significantly changed (P [ 0.05)
(Fig. 3a–d). In agreement with results of western blotting,
Akt and GSK3b have the same expression at the mRNA
level (P [ 0.05) (Fig. 4a).
Western Blotting (Fig. 3e, f) suggested that the expression of NF-jB p65 nuclear was upregulated after ischemia,
and was decreased in Evo-H and Evo-L groups at 24 h
compared with Vehicle group (P \ 0.05), while the NF-jB
p65 cytosolic presented an opposite expression (P \ 0.05).

NF-jB was upregulated after ischemia, and was decreased
in Evo-H and Evo-L groups at 24 h compared with Vehicle
group (Fig. 4b) (P \ 0.05).

Evo has been reported to elicit a variety of biological
effects in treatment of inflammatory diseases, atherosclerosis, tumors and others. In mouse model of Alzheimer’s
disease, Evo improves cognitive abilities through its antiinflammatory effects. Previous study has provided the
evidence that Evo had a direct effect in the hypothalamus
[39] and it can repress hypoxia-induced inflammatory
response. Additionally, Evo exerts a protective effect on
ischemia/reperfusion damage in heart [30]. These above
observations raise the possibility that Evo may have protective effects on ischemic brain injury. Therefore, we tried
to explore the neuroprotective properties of Evo at 24 h
after ischemic stroke, and further investigated the potential
mechanisms. Consistent with our hypothesis, Evo administration, both dosage of 50 and 100 mg/kg, could relieve
neurological deficits, reduce brain edema, and decrease
infarct size in a dose dependant manner, suggesting an
effective protection of Evo in acute cerebral ischemia. In
this study, we demonstrated that Evo induced rescue of Akt
activity and consequently blocked GSK3b dephosphorylation after cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, Evo administration hampered NF-jB p65 shift from cytoplasm to
nucleus. Thus, we speculated that activating Akt/GSK
signal pathway may be an attractive candidate to explain
protective effects of Evo in the acute stage of ischemic
stroke.
The Akt/PKB signaling pathway is known as one of the
most relevant pathways in regulating neuronal survival
[40]. As a primary mediator of survival signals, Akt can
phosphorylate and inactivate GSK3b which is a transducer
of pro-inflammatory signals [41] at its N-terminus (at Ser9).
In addition, Akt also has a role in modulating intracellular
glucose metabolism, and consequently enhancing energy
production after ischemia. Thus, Akt is an excellent therapeutic target for preserving neuron viability in the acute

Evo Protected the Structure and Function of Blood–
Brain Barrier (BBB)
To further explore the protective mechanism of Evo in
cerebral ischemia, the expression of tight junction protein
claudin-5 was examined by western blot and qRT-PCR at
24 h after pMCAO. Compared with Sham group, claudin-5
was significantly downregulated in pMCAO and Vehicle
group. Low and high doses of Evo significantly upregulated the reduced expression of claudin-5 at both protein
and mRNA levels (both P \ 0.05) (Fig. 5a–c).

Discussion
The past decades have seen unprecedented advances in
understanding of physiological processes in cerebral
ischemia. To a large extent, it is due to the focus on
pMCAO as a well-characterized and classical experimental model [36, 37]. Pro-inflammatory responses occur
within minutes after the onset of cerebral ischemia and
exacerbate the progression of brain damage [2, 38]. So
the inhibition of inflammatory responses at the early stage
of ischemia provides an attractive therapeutic strategy. In
our study, pMCAO model is used to evaluate the
expression of pAkt, pGSK-3b, NF-jB and claudin-5 in
the acute focal cerebral ischemia and to explore the
interrelation between Evo’s neuroprotection effect and the
role of the Akt/GSK pathway in mediating the antiinflammatory effects in vivo.

ischemic period. As recently shown, the inhibitory effect of
Akt on inflammation is dependent on its downstream substrate GSK-3b. GSK3 has emerged as a key regulatory
switch in the modulation of inflammation [42]. Unlike most
kinases, GSK3 is constitutively active in cells and can be
inactivated by phosphorylation [43]. Under stimulation,
GSK3 is phosphorylated at serine 21 for GSK3a or serine 9
for GSK3b, resulting in the inhibition of GSK3 kinase
activity. Under conditions where Akt activity is decreased
such as after ischemia, GSK-3b can thus be activated.
Functionally, active GSK-3b can enhance the operation of
various pro-inflammatory signaling molecules, including
NF-jB [42], IL-6, and MCP-1 [44]. In our study, Evo
lowered the levels of active GSK-3b after stroke, thereby
decreasing the ability of GSK-3b to augment the inflammatory response.

It is well known that NF-jB is critical effecter and
regulator of inflammation response [15]. As a regulator of
survival and death proteins, NF-jB plays a pivotal role of
neuron survival in the central nervous system [45]. For
pMCAO it was demonstrated that the role of NF-jB was
detrimental [46], so inhibiting the activation of NF-jB is
protective and may develops smaller infarct in the acute
stage of ischemia [49]. In the current study, accumulation
of nuclear NF-jB induced by ischemia was ameliorated
after Evo administration, which indicated down-regulating
NF-jB may be an attractive candidate to explain protective
role of Evo in the acute stage of ischemic stroke.
Ischemia sets into motion a train of events to disrupt the
BBB [47, 50]. After cerebral ischemia, BBB’s permeability
was altered, peroxidase extravasation frequently involved
arterioles, veins and venules surrounded by perivascular
spaces [47] and considerable toxic materials enter into the
brain, which results in tissue damage and vasogenic edema
[48]. As a result, the regulation of BBB is one of the crucial
points for the prevention of brain damage [51]. In the BBB,
endothelial cells play the main barrier roles in excluding
the toxic materials in order to maintain brain homeostasis
[52]. Tight junctions (TJs) in endothelial cells are considered to determine vascular permeability. Claudin-5,
expressed in large amounts especially in cerebral endothelial cells, is a major component of TJ strands [53], and
the altered expression of claudin-5 can increase cerebral
endothelial barrier permeability [54]. In our study, the
expression of claudin-5 was decreased in the ischemic
brain tissues whereas treatment of Evo increased the
expression of claudin-5. It was suggested that Evo may
play a role in ameliorating the permeability of BBB in
cerebral ischemia; this effect may be through upregulating
the expression of claudin-5.
In general, this study is the first time to give a scientific
warrant to the therapeutic effect of Evo in the treatment of
ischemic stroke. Although the approaches where Evo
works may not be limited to one pathway, the results
provided clear evidence that systemic administration of
Evo could decrease neurological impairment and tissue
injury under cerebral ischemic conditions and this effect
may be through upregulating the expression of pAkt,
pGSK3b, downregulating the expression of NF-jB, and
ameliorating BBB permeability. This results provided
some reasonable and basic research evidences for supporting a hypothesis that Evo may be a legitimate candidate for the treatment of cerebral ischemia and it’s
therapeutical effect might be through upregulating Akt/
GSK signaling pathway.
