Objective: While transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a well-known harbinger of ischemic stroke, the mechanisms
that link TIA to subsequent strokes remain poorly understood. The overall aim of this study was to determine
whether: 1) brief periods of transient cerebral ischemia render this tissue more vulnerable to thrombus development and 2) antiplatelet agents used in TIA patients alter ischemia-induced thrombogenesis.
Approach & results: The middle cerebral artery of C57BL/6 mice was occluded for 2.5–10 min, followed by reperfusion periods of 1–28 days. Intravital microscopy was used to monitor thrombus development in cerebral
microvessels induced by light/dye photoactivation. Thrombosis was quantiﬁed as the time to platelet aggregation
on the vessel wall and the time for complete blood ﬂow cessation. While brief periods of cerebral ischemia
were not associated with neurological deﬁcits or brain infarction (evaluated after 1 day), it yielded a pronounced
and prolonged (up to 28 days) acceleration of thrombus formation, compared to control (sham) mice. This
prothrombotic phenotype was not altered by pre- and/or post-treatment of mice with either aspirin (A), clopidogrel
(C), dipyridamole (D), or atorvastatin (S), or with A + D + S.
Conclusions: The increased vulnerability of the cerebral vasculature to thrombus development after a brief period of
transient ischemia can be recapitulated in a murine model. Antiplatelet or antithrombotic agents used in patients
with TIA show no beneﬁt in this mouse model of brief transient ischemia.

Introduction
Stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide
(O'Donnell et al., 2010), with approximately 800,000 people suffering
a stroke each year in the US (Roger et al., 2011). There are a number
of underlying causes of stroke, including thrombosis, embolism, stenosis, and intracerebral hemorrhage. Ischemic stroke, which accounts for
approximately 85% of all strokes, is more commonly characterized as either thrombotic or embolic, depending on the origin of the clot that
causes vessel blockage. Embolic strokes are usually of extracranial origin
and commonly result from clots formed in the heart due to atrial ﬁbrillation. Thrombotic strokes, on the other hand, are typically of intracranial origin and result from the rupture of an atheroma and subsequent
injury of a downstream vessel, with the ensuing development of a
thrombus in either a large (middle cerebral artery) or a small (lacunar)
artery in the brain (Li et al., 2010). Stroke recurrence occurs at a rate
ranging between 4 and 14% and patients with risk factors, such as

hypertension, are at higher risk for stroke recurrence. Up to 60–70% of
recurrent strokes are of the same subtype as the initial stroke (Lovett
et al., 2004).
Transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a mini-stroke, has
traditionally been deﬁned as an ischemic stroke of short duration that
produces focal neurological dysfunction (without objective evidence
of brain infarction) that generally last less than 24 h (Easton et al.,
2009; Sacco et al., 2013). TIA is considered a warning sign of increased
risk for a subsequent serious and debilitating stroke. About 30% of people experiencing a TIA later suffer a serious stroke (Dennis et al., 1990).
Little is known about the mechanism(s) that account for the ability of a
TIA to render the brain more vulnerable to a subsequent severe ischemic
episode. It is generally thought that TIA patients have an elevated risk
for suffering a more profound adverse vascular event than produced
by the initial TIA, such as clot production caused by atrial ﬁbrillation
or rupture of a large vessel atheroma due to instability in the underlying
embolic or thrombotic process (Johnston, 2005). It is also possible that
TIA renders the cerebral vasculature hyper-responsive to thrombus
formation in response to vessel wall injury, such as that induced by
released atheroma fragments.
The increased likelihood for a second ischemic insult after TIA occurs
in conjunction with the phenomenon of ischemic preconditioning
(IPC) or tolerance, in which brain tissue is rendered resistant to the

418

deleterious effects of prolonged ischemia and reperfusion by prior
exposure to very brief periods of ischemia (Gidday, 2006; Kirino,
2002; He et al., 2012). The robust brain protection that is afforded by ischemic tolerance has been attributed to the induction of different survival mechanisms in neurons, rather than an improvement of the
cerebral blood ﬂow response after exposure to the second ischemic insult (Gidday, 2006; Kirino, 2002). Nonetheless, some elements (endothelial cells) of the cerebral vasculature do exhibit a protective
phenotype after IPC and this is manifested as improved blood–brain
barrier integrity and an attenuated leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion
response (Gidday, 2006). Although brain IPC is associated with
prolonged coagulation and bleeding times (Chen et al., 2005; Kim
et al., 2008), it remains unclear whether platelet dynamics at the
blood–endothelial cell interface as well as the potential for microvascular thrombosis is altered in response to brief transient episodes of cerebral ischemia. Hence, a major objective of this study was to determine
whether the phenomenon of IPC (or tolerance) in the brain includes a
protective (diminished) response to thrombus development in the cerebral microvasculature or whether transient brain ischemia leads to
an acceleration of thrombus development that may be relevant to the
pathophysiology of TIA.
The results of this study revealed that a brief period (2.5–
10 min) of transient focal cerebral ischemia elicits a pronounced
and prolonged (up to 28 days) acceleration of injury-induced
thrombus formation in the cerebral microvasculature. Given the
potential relevance of these ﬁndings to TIA, additional studies were
undertaken to assess the effectiveness of different antiplatelet agents
(aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole) and atorvastatin, either alone or
in combination, in reversing the ischemia-induced enhancement of
thrombus development in the cerebral microcirculation. These agents
were selected for study because they represent the ﬁrst line of therapeutic intervention for prevention of a secondary stroke after TIA
(Johnston, 2005).
Materials and methods
Animals
Male C57BL/6 mice (25–35 g body weight, 6–10 weeks old) were
purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The experimental
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at LSU Health Sciences Center and are in compliance with
the National Institutes of Health guidelines. All efforts were made to
minimize animal distress and the number of animals used.
Induction of transient cerebral ischemia
Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced in anesthetized
(150 mg/kg ketamine and 7.5 mg/kg xylazine) mice using the
intraluminal ﬁlament method, as previously described (Ishikawa
et al., 2005). The MCA was occluded for a period of 2.5 to 10 min,
followed by a recovery (reperfusion) period of 1–28 days. Sham mice
were subjected to the same procedure without arteriotomy and monoﬁlament insertion.
Intravital video microscopy
Following 1 to 28 days of reperfusion, the mice were anesthetized
and craniectomy (3 mm diameter; 1 mm posterior, 4 mm lateral from
the bregma) was made and covered with a glass coverslip. The space
between the glass and the dura mater was ﬁlled with artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (Gavins et al., 2007). The mouse was placed to the stage
of an upright ﬂuorescent microscope (BX51WI; Olympus, Japan)
and allowed to equilibrate for 30 min. Visualization of individual cerebral microvessels and the induction of thrombus formation were
achieved using a 40 × water immersion objective lens (LUMPlan FI/IR

40 ×/0.80 ×; Olympus). The images were recorded on a DVD player
(SR-MV50; JVC, Wayne, NJ). The diameters of the selected microvessels
were measured using video analysis software (Image J software; NIH,
US) on a personal computer (G4 Macintosh; Apple, CA).
Light/dye induced thrombosis
A 10 ml/kg body weight dose of 5% ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
dextran (FITC; 150,000 molecular weight; Sigma-Aldrich, US) was
injected into the femoral vein and allowed to circulate for 10 min.
Photoactivation of FITC (excitation, 495 nm; emission, 519 nm) was initiated by exposing 100 μm vessel length to epi-illumination with a 175W xenon lamp (Lamda LS, Sutter, US) coupled with a ﬂuorescein ﬁlter
cube (HQ-FITC; Chroma Technology, US). The excitation power density
was calibrated daily and maintained within 1% of 0.17 W/cm2, as previously described (Senchenkova et al., 2013). During continuous epiillumination, thrombus formation was visualized and quantiﬁed in
both venules and arterioles (diameters: 20–40 μm) by determining
the time of onset of platelet deposition/aggregation (visualized as the
initial accumulation of 3 + platelets) on the vessel wall (onset time)
and the time to complete blood ﬂow cessation (cessation time). Onset
time and cessation time were averaged from 2 to 4 induced thrombi
in each vessel type (i.e., venules and arterioles) of the same mouse.
The internal diameters of arterioles and venules were measured by
off-line analysis for the period immediately preceding the determination of onset time and just prior to complete ﬂow cessation. In order
to address whether the light/dye method elicited vasoconstriction, the
diameters measured at the time of ﬂow cessation were normalized
(expressed as %) to the diameter determined prior to onset time.
Neurological assessment
The functional consequences of the transient ischemic insult were
evaluated in mice following 1–24 h of reperfusion using a 5-point
scale neurological deﬁcit score where: 0 = no deﬁcit; 1 = failure to
extend right paw; 2 = circling to the right; 3 = falling to the right;
and 4 = unable to walk spontaneously, as previously described
(Ishikawa et al., 2005).
Quantiﬁcation of infarction volume
After 24 h reperfusion, mice were euthanized, the brain immediately
removed, and placed into 4 °C PBS for 15 min. Coronal sections (2-mm)
were stained with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution for 15 min at 37 °C and ﬁxed by immersion in 10% formaldehyde
(Terao et al., 2008). The total areas of each brain section and the infarcted region were quantiﬁed using a computerized image analysis program (NIH Image Software).
Anti-platelet therapy
Aspirin, clopidogrel and dipyridamole were obtained from Sigma
Chemicals (St. Louis, MO) and atorvastatin from AK Scientiﬁc Inc
(Union City, CA). In these mice, the brain was subjected to 5 min of
transient focal cerebral ischemia followed by 1 day of reperfusion. The
following treatment (prior to MCA occlusion) regimens were used:
aspirin (50 mg/kg/day, 5 days of pretreatment plus one dose 2 h after
ischemia, by gavage) (Tailor et al., 2007), dipyridamole (60 mg/kg by
gavage, 2 h after ischemia) (Kim et al., 2008) and atorvastatin
(10 mg/kg/day, 5 days of pretreatment plus one dose immediately
after ischemia) (Chen et al., 2005). Clopidogrel (3 mg/kg by gavage)
(Bird et al., 2012) was administered 2 h following release of the MCA
occlusion. For the combination treatment experiments, the following
schedule was used: 1) atorvastatin (14 days of pretreatment plus
one dose after ischemia), 5 days of dipyridamole pretreatment plus
one dose after ischemia, or 2) atorvastatin and dipyridamole (as

described in #1) plus 5 days of aspirin pretreatment and one dose 2 h
after ischemia.

signiﬁcant sustained behavioral changes at 2–4 and 24 h after reperfusion, and yielded a large infarct volume at 24 h (Table 1).

Enhanced thrombus formation after brief periods of MCAo and reperfusion

Anesthetized mice were placed on a warm pad and the tails were
transected 5 mm from the tip with a razor blade and immediately
immersed into a 15 ml falcon tube ﬁlled with 14 ml saline (37 ºC). The
total time (including re-bleeding time) for cessation of bleeding was
recorded, and after 10 min the bleeding was stopped by cauterization.
Immunohistochemistry
Spontaneous thrombus development in cerebral microvessels was
evaluated in mice subjected to either 5 min or 60 min of MCAo followed
by 24 h of reperfusion. For these experiments, mice were transcardially
perfused with 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 10% formalin. Brains were collected, embedded in parafﬁn, and sectioned into 5
μm sections. The sections were deparafﬁnized followed by antigen
retrieval using 1 × antigen decloaker (Biocare Medical, Concord, CA).
Sections were then stained for ﬁbrinogen and glycoprotein 1 beta
(GP1b). The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-mouse ﬁbrinogen
(1:500; GeneTex, Irvine, CA) and rat anti-mouse GP1b (1:100; Emfret,
Eibelstadt, Germany). Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor®
647 goat anti-rabbit (1:600; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and
Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rat (1:500; Life Technologies). Images of
the double stained tissue sections were captured on an Olympus
BX51WI upright microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) with a 20×
(LUCPlanFLN) objective and equipped with a 3i LaserStack laser launch
(3i; Denver, CO), Yokogawa CSU-X1-A1N-E spinning disk confocal unit
(Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and electron multiplier
CCD camera (C9100-13; Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ). 488- and 640nm laser excitation were used in rapid sequence and visualized with
the appropriate ﬁlters (Semrock, Rochester, NY). Slidebook software
(3i) was used to drive the confocal system and capture images for
ofﬂine analysis. Merged images were used to determine areas of colocalization.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means ± SEM unless otherwise indicated.
One-way ANOVA was used with the Bonferroni post hoc test. Differences between two data sets were determined using the two-tailed
unpaired t-test. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at p b 0.05.
Results
Neurological deﬁcit and injury response to transient cerebral ischemia
While 2.5 to 10 min of MCAo, followed by reperfusion, did not
induce signiﬁcant sustained neurological deﬁcits or produce a detectable brain infarction at 24 h, exposure of the mouse brain to 120 min
of ischemia (followed by the same durations of reperfusion) elicited

Thrombus formation in cerebral arterioles and venules was quantiﬁed in control and sham-operated mice, and in mice subjected to 2.5–
10 min of MCAo, followed by 24 h reperfusion (Fig. 1). A signiﬁcant
enhancement of thrombus development (reﬂected in both onset and
cessation times) was detected in cerebral arterioles of mice subjected
to 2.5–10 min MCAo and 24 h reperfusion (MCAo/R). While a similar
trend was noted in venules, the response was more variable and did
not achieve statistical signiﬁcance. Because no differences in the thrombosis response were noted between 2.5, 5 and 10 min of MCAo, all
subsequent experiments were performed using 5 min MCAo.
An assessment of the changes in vessel diameter elicited by the light/
dye method was performed in sham control mice and in mice exposed
to 5 min MCAo and 24 h reperfusion. Vessel diameters detected just
prior to complete ﬂow cessation and normalized to the diameter measured just prior to onset time were as follows: arterioles—sham controls
(97.6 ± 0.8%) and MCAo/R (97.8 ± 0.6%), and venules—sham controls
(96.6 ± 0.7%) and MCAo/R (96.1 ± 1.0%). The data suggest that the
light/dye method elicited minimal vasoconstriction in both arterioles
and venules of mice subjected to either a sham procedure or MCAo/R.

Duration of accelerated arteriolar thrombosis after transient focal cerebral
ischemia
The time-course of the 5 min MCAo-induced enhancement of
cerebral arteriolar thrombosis was assessed over a period of 28 days
following reperfusion (Fig. 2). The accelerated onset time and time
to ﬂow cessation induced in cerebral arterioles by 5 min MCAo were
detected up to 28 days following the transient ischemic insult.
Spontaneous thrombus formation following transient ischemia
Fluorescent staining was performed on the brains of mice that were
subjected to either 60 min or 5 min of MCAo followed by 24 h of reperfusion. The brains were stained for ﬁbrinogen and GP1b (platelet marker) to identify thrombi. As previously reported (Kleinschnitz et al.,
2006), mice exposed to 60 min ischemia and 24 h reperfusion had evidence of spontaneous thrombus formation in arterioles in the ipsilateral
hemisphere, as indicated by areas of co-localization of ﬁbrinogen and
GP1b (Supplementary Fig. S1A); no staining was observed in the contralateral hemisphere (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Spontaneous thrombus
formation was not observed in cerebral arterioles of mice subjected to
5 min ischemia and 24 h reperfusion. However, the shorter duration
of ischemia did result in ﬁbrinogen and GP1b positive staining within
capillary sized vessels in the ipsilateral hemisphere, as evidenced by
activated platelets surrounded by lower levels of ﬁbrinogen staining
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). This pattern was not detected in the contralateral hemisphere (Supplementary Fig. S1D).

to the time required for complete ﬂow cessation. *Indicates p b 0.01 compared to control (n = 13) or sham (n = 8) mice.

Effects of aspirin (ASA) treatment on the thrombosis response to focal
cerebral ischemia
Mice treated with ASA for either 1 or 6 consecutive days prior to
measurement of thrombus formation following MCAo/R did not reveal
a signiﬁcant change in either the time of onset or time to ﬂow cessation
in cerebral arterioles after light/dye injury (Fig. 3A). We have previously
reported that the dose of ASA used in these studies completely inhibits

cyclooxygenase activity in mouse platelets (Tailor et al., 2007). The antiplatelet effect of the ASA treatment regimen is supported by the
signiﬁcant increase in tail bleeding time (Table 2).
Effects of clopidogrel, dipyridamole and statin monotherapy on the
thrombosis response
Studies were also undertaken to examine the inﬂuence of treatment
with either clopidogrel (Fig. 3B), dipyridamole (Fig. 4A) or atorvastatin
(Fig. 4B) on the accelerated arteriolar thrombosis elicited by transient
cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. With all three agents, either short
term (1 day) or long-term (6 day) pretreatment did not alter the
MCAo/R-induced enhancement of cerebral arteriolar thrombosis, despite the efﬁcacy of all three agents (individually) in prolonging tail
bleeding time (Table 2).
Effects of anti-platelet + statin polytherapy on microvascular thrombosis
response
Given the absence of effect of the above-mentioned drug treatments
on the accelerated thrombosis response to MCAo/R, we evaluated the
effects of combinations of these drugs (Fig. 5). Treatment with either a
combination of atorvastatin (15 days) + dipyridamole (6 days), or
atorvastatin (15 days) + dipyridamole (6 days) + aspirin (6 days)
did not alter the thrombosis response to MCAo/R. Both polytherapy
regimens were effective in prolonging the tail bleeding time (Table 2).
Discussion

Fig. 2. The accelerated arteriolar thrombosis following transient focal ischemia (5 min) is
sustained for 28 days following reperfusion. Thrombus development was evaluated in
control (day-0; n = 13) mice and at 1- (n = 8), 2- (n = 4), 3- (n = 4), 7- (n = 3), 14(n = 3) and 28- (n = 2) days of reperfusion. Onset indicates the time of onset of platelet
deposition on the vessel wall, while cessation refers to the time required for complete ﬂow
cessation. *Denotes p b 0.05 compared to control (day-0) response.

Animal models of ischemic stroke have revealed that exposure of the
brain to a brief period (5–10 min) of sublethal ischemia protects the tissue and improves outcome following a more severe ischemic insult
(Gidday, 2006; Kirino, 2002). This preconditioning response, which

has been attributed to the upregulation of neuroprotective genes
(Stenzel-Poore et al., 2003), is seemingly at odds with clinical evidence
that TIA patients are at greater risk for a subsequent more severe ischemic stroke. It has been suggested that the divergent effects of antecedent sublethal ischemia on stroke risk versus outcome may reﬂect
differential responses of the cerebral vasculature and neuronal tissue
to the initial insult, with the former (e.g., endothelial cells) exhibiting
damage and the latter (neurons, glia) showing protection (Danton
et al., 2002). Nonetheless, there are some reports that describe an

improvement of cerebral vascular function (e.g., blood–brain barrier
permeability, endothelium-dependent vasodilation) in response to IPC
(Gidday, 2006). However, vascular wall thrombogenicity may be of
greater relevance to the increased risk for stroke following brief periods
of transient ischemia (or TIA). In the present study, we examined
whether brief periods of sublethal cerebral ischemia followed by reperfusion alter the potential for thrombus development in the cerebral microvasculature. Our study revealed that 2.5–10 min of brain ischemia
elicits a pronounced and prolonged (up to 28 days) acceleration of
thrombus formation in cerebral arterioles, ﬁndings consistent with an
increased risk for thrombotic stroke after TIA.
Although thrombus formation following IPC in the brain has not
been previously addressed, there are studies of other tissues that bear
on this issue. For example, an examination of thrombus formation in
large arteries (coronary and femoral) subjected to either local or remote
(distant tissue) IPC has revealed improved vessel patency, the generation of small thrombi and fewer emboli after a subsequent insult
(Hata et al., 1998; Ropcke et al., 2012). The anti-thrombogenic response
of larger arteries to IPC is supported by a report describing attenuation
of different molecular indices of platelet activation, including ﬁbrinogen

binding and aggregation with neutrophils (Linden et al., 2006). Studies
of microvascular thrombogenesis after preconditioning have been more
limited. However, one report (Rücker et al., 2009) describes a signiﬁcant
acceleration of thrombus formation in microvessels (both arterioles and
venules) of muscle and subcutis of rat hindlimb preconditioned by
thermal stress (either hypothermia or hyperthermia). The latter study,
when considered with the ﬁndings in our study of the cerebral microvasculature and published data from large arteries, suggests that, unlike
large arteries, arterioles respond to preconditioning stimuli by exhibiting an exaggerated thrombogenic response. Our ﬁndings of an enhancement of thrombogenicity in cerebral arterioles after brief transient
ischemia may have relevance to the role of small vessel disease in the
pathogenesis of TIA and to the increased risk for silent strokes after
TIA (Laloux et al., 1994; Wang et al., 2011).
It has been previously reported that 45–60 min of focal brain ischemia followed by 23–24 h of reperfusion is associated with spontaneous
development of microvascular thrombosis, as evidenced by ﬁbrin deposition in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere (Choudhri et al., 1998;
Kleinschnitz et al., 2006). While we were able to conﬁrm this observation in this study using ﬁbrinogen and platelet immunostaining, we
found no evidence for spontaneous thrombus development in arterioles
or venules following a brief period (5 min) of ischemia and 24 h reperfusion. This observation, coupled to our intravital microscopic ﬁndings,
suggests that the deleterious effect of the brief transient ischemic
episode is to render the cerebral microvasculature more vulnerable to
a subsequent stress condition that promotes thrombogenesis.
A variety of drugs have been used to reduce the risk of recurrent
stroke following TIA or ischemic stroke due to thrombosis. These
include antiplatelet therapies such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and
dipyridamole, as well as statins (Phillips, 2008; Sudlow, 2008). These
agents, when used alone, have generally shown some efﬁcacy in reducing stroke recurrence. Since the recurrence rate following treatment
with an antiplatelet agent or statin remains high, emphasis has also
been given to using combination therapy, which has proven to be
more effective for secondary prevention of stroke than single drug therapy (Phillips, 2008). Hence, another major objective of our study was to

determine whether aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, and atorvastatin
attenuate the accelerated cerebral microvascular thrombus formation
that follows a brief period of transient focal ischemia. Our ﬁndings
indicate that none of these drugs, when used alone or in combination,
signiﬁcantly blunt the accelerated cerebral microvascular thrombus development elicited by a brief ischemic episode. This lack of protection
was noted despite evidence for a signiﬁcant prolongation of bleeding
time with each treatment regimen.
While a deﬁnitive explanation for the insensitivity of thrombus
formation in cerebral arterioles to antiplatelet and/or statin therapy is
not readily available, this may reﬂect species-related differences in
coagulation proﬁles and/or efﬁcacy of anti-platelet drugs between
rodents and human, and/or differences in the contribution of platelets
vs the vessel wall to thrombus development in microscopic vs large arteries. Consistent with the latter notion is a report describing a greater
dependency of occlusive thrombus formation on platelet count in the
carotid artery than in arterioles (Morowski et al., 2013). It was noted
that while thrombus development in damaged arterioles occurs even
when platelet count is reduced by 97.5%, thrombosis in the carotid
artery requires a platelet count that is greater than 20% of control
(Morowski et al., 2013). Macroscopic and microscopic arteries also exhibit signiﬁcant differences in physical forces (e.g., shear rate), expression of coagulation factors (e.g., von Willebrand factor) and local
production of platelet agonists (e.g., ADP, thrombin, thromboxane)
and antagonists (e.g., adenosine, prostacyclin) that could account for
the insensitivity of thrombus formation in cerebral arterioles to antiplatelet agents and statins. Finally, it should be noted that anti-platelet
and anticoagulant agents other than the ones used in this study have
shown some efﬁcacy in murine models of ischemic stroke. For example,
it has been reported that targeting coagulation factor XII effectively
reduces vessel-occluding ﬁbrin formation in ischemic cerebral
microvessels (Kleinschnitz et al., 2006). Furthermore, it has been
shown that interfering with either von Willbrand factor (Kleinschnitz
et al., 2009) or GPIb-alpha (Kleinschnitz et al., 2007) protects mice
against ischemic stroke. Consequently, these targets may be more
appropriate for interference with TIA-enhanced thrombogenesis.
The known antithrombotic actions of statins appear to differ from
that of antiplatelet drugs. While statins can inhibit components of
the coagulation cascade (e.g., tissue factor), and blunt the activation,
adhesion and aggregation of platelets, these drugs also diminish the
adhesivity of microvascular endothelium for both platelets and leukocytes (Stokes et al., 2002; Violi et al., 2013). The anti-adhesive effects
of statins have been attributed to the activation of endothelial cell nitric
oxide synthase and generation of nitric oxide (Stokes et al., 2002). Manipulation of nitric oxide (NO) production alters thrombus development in the microvasculature, with studies showing that endothelial
cell-derived NO protects against thromboembolism in venules, but not
in arterioles (Broeders et al., 1998). While the effects of statin treatment
on thrombus development in cerebral arterioles have not been previously addressed, rosuvastatin-treated mice have been shown to exhibit
an attenuation of ferric chloride-induced thrombus formation in the
carotid artery (Schäfer et al., 2005).
In conclusion, the ﬁndings of this study reveal an increased
thrombogenicity of cerebral arterioles after exposure to a brief period
of sub-lethal ischemia followed by reperfusion. This response, which
persists for up to 28 days after the ischemic insult, suggests that the
walls of cerebral arterioles do not exhibit the protective preconditioning
that is manifested in neuronal tissue subjected to similar insults. The
inability of different antiplatelet agents and/or a statin to blunt the
ischemia–reperfusion induced acceleration of thrombus formation in
cerebral arterioles indicates that alternative cellular and molecular
mechanisms/targets contribute to this response. Additional work is
needed to determine the pathophysiological relevance of these observations relative to the increased risk for stroke after TIA, and to deﬁne the
mechanism(s) that underlie the enhanced thrombogenicity in cerebral
arterioles following a brief period of sub-lethal ischemia.
