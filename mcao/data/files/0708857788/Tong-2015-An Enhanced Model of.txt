ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Current nonhuman primate stroke models are limited by either stroke variability or survivability. A new
nonhuman primate stroke model was developed by using endovascular trapping techniques to limit collateral vessels with serial MR
imaging and neurologic assessments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight adult rhesus monkeys (female, 7–13 years of age) underwent MR imaging and Spetzler neurologic
assessment followed by endovascular stroke induction consisting of superselective endovascular placement of surgical silk sutures into
the right MCA by using a trapping technique. Two initial subjects were euthanized immediately following postocclusion MR imaging. The
subsequent 6 subjects recovered and underwent follow-up MR imaging and Spetzler neurologic assessments at 48 hours, with 4 being
followed to 96 hours. Stroke infarct volumes were measured, and the longitudinal Spetzler clinical neurologic scores were assessed. The
brain tissues were harvested and prepared with hematoxylin-eosin staining.
RESULTS: Focal permanent cerebral ischemia was induced in the targeted right MCA territory in all subjects. The volumes of the ischemic
lesions at 6, 48, and 96 hours were 3.18 ⫾ 1.007 mL (standard error of the mean) (n ⫽ 8), 6.70 ⫾ 1.666 mL (standard error of the mean) (n ⫽
6), and 7.23 ⫾ 1.371 mL (standard error of the mean) (n ⫽ 4). For the survival animals, the immediate postsurgical Spetzler grading score
improved from 60.7 at 24 hours to 68.7 at 48 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a trapping modiﬁcation to an established endovascular suture stroke model that yielded reproducible
ischemia and clinically quantiﬁable neurologic deﬁcits with no strokes in nontarget areas. This technique may be useful in evaluating
translational stroke and penumbral imaging research in addition to preclinical testing of neuroprotective therapies.

with transorbital neurosurgical clipping of the middle cerebral artery
to address collateral vessels. The resultant strokes involved both the
cortex and deep nuclei, requiring prolonged intensive care limiting
the opportunity to perform behavioral assessments.3
Recent surgical and endovascular stroke models have used
nonhuman primates with less robust collaterals and greater similarity to humans, resulting in more consistent stroke results and
allowing postoperative neurologic assessments. Approaches include the surgical introduction of an intraluminal thread from the
external carotid artery to the origin of the MCA,4 injection of
autologous clot into the ICA,5 injection of silk suture into the
MCA,6 transient microcatheter occlusion of the MCA,7 permanent MCA occlusion with cyanoacrylate,8 and combined neurosurgical and endovascular thrombin-injection techniques.9 Ideally, a preclinical cortical stroke model would be reproducible,
minimally invasive, minimize pain and distress, spare the deep
nuclei, and allow serial behavioral assessments. Neurosurgical approaches typically offer more reliable stroke-induction volumes
while giving up at least some ability to track neurologic assessments. Endovascular approaches minimize postoperative impair-

ment but have more stroke volume and distribution variability.
We describe a new survivable endovascular trapping technique of
ischemic stroke induction in the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), allowing serial behavioral assessment and relative sparing
of the deep nuclei.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eight rhesus monkeys were sourced from the Yerkes National
Primate Research Center with procedures designed to minimize
pain and suffering and approval by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. The subjects were female and ranging from 7
years 9 months to 13 years 7 months and from 6.93 to 9.90 kg. The
animals were housed indoors on a standard light-dark cycle individually with routine laboratory diet supplemented by fruits and vegetables with water available at liberty. Two weeks before planned surgery, each subject underwent a routine health and neurologic
assessment by using the Spetzler grading scale,10 followed by general
anesthesia and baseline brain MR imaging.
Two initial animals underwent endovascular stroke induction
and serial MR imaging examination with immediate sacrifice. Six
subsequent subjects underwent stroke induction, MR imaging scanning, and survival with daily follow-up neurologic assessments and
MR imaging at 48 hours (6 of 6 subjects) and 96 hours (4 of 6 subjects). Immediately following the final MR imaging, the animals were
sacrificed and the brain tissue was preserved in formalin.

Prescan
MR imaging prescanning of the brain was performed at least 7
days before stroke induction. Each subject was anesthetized with
3–5 mg/kg of tiletamine/zolazepam (Telazol) or 10 mg/kg of
ketamine followed by induction of general anesthesia by using
⬃1.0% isoflurane mixed with 100% O2. The pulse rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, end-tidal gas, blood pressure, and endtidal CO2 were monitored and maintained in the normal range.11
Body temperature was maintained at 37.5°C by a circulating
warm-water blanket, and each subject was supine and immobilized with a head holder during scanning. The MR imaging consisted of T1 (magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition of gradient echo sequence with TR ⫽ 2500 ms, TE ⫽ 3.33 ms, FOV ⫽

with an 8-channel phased array knee coil (Invivo Inc. Gainesville,
Florida).

Stroke Induction
The subject was brought to the operating suite, where general
anesthesia was administered, and placed in a radiolucent head
holder. The bilateral groin regions were shaved, prepped, and
draped. Sonographic guidance was used to visualize the right
common femoral artery. A small skin nick was placed by using a
No. 11 scalpel blade, and a 22-ga access needle (French Silhouette
Transitionless Micropunture Introducer Set, Cook Incorporated,
Bloomington, Indiana) was placed into the right common femoral artery. This was exchanged over a 0.018-inch Cope Mandrel
(Cook Medical) by using a 4F microdilator (Cook Medical). A 4F
65-cm Glide catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was placed over a
0.035-inch Bentson guidewire (Olympus, Shinjuku, Japan) by using the Seldinger technique, and 500 U of IV heparin was administered. The 4 French non-taper angle Glide catheter (Terumo;
Medical Corporation, Somerset, New Jersey) was placed into the
right ICA by using C-arm fluoroscopic guidance (Siremobil
Compact, Siemens), and positioning was checked with manual
injection of iohexol (Omnipaque 300 contrast; GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, New Jersey). Anteroposterior and lateral cerebral angiograms were obtained.
An Echelon 10 (Covidien, Irvine, California) microcather was
inserted into the targeted M2/M3 branches of the right MCA under roadmap through the 4F diagnostic catheter over a 0.010-inch
SilverSpeed microguidewire (Covidien). Superselective angiography was performed by hand injection to verify suitable placement
and stroke targeting. Multiple 5-mm segments of 4 – 0 silk suture
(Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson, Cincinnati, Ohio) were injected
through the microcatheter until slowing of flow within the desired
M3 branch was seen. The microcatheter was partially withdrawn
into the M1 segment of the right MCA. A final 10-mm segment of
suture was injected, and the microcatheter was removed. Anteroposterior and lateral postangiograms were repeated before catheter removal and administration of 2 mg of protamine sulfate IV.
Hemostasis was obtained with manual compression for 15 minutes and a single 4 – 0 polydioxanone suture (PDS Plus Sutures;
Ethicon).

Poststroke Imaging, Neurologic Assessment, and
Recovery
Poststroke images were repeated up to 7 hours after stroke induction. The 2 initial subjects were then euthanized, while the subsequent 6 subjects recovered from anesthesia and were monitored.
The survival subjects were maintained in an individual cage with
veterinary staff supervision and 24-hour continuous video monitoring. Softened routine veterinary chow, fruit, and water were
offered. Assessment of overall well-being and Spetzler neurologic
deficit scoring were performed daily, with MR imaging scans repeated at 48 hours (6 of 6 subjects) and 96 hours (4 of 6 subjects)
poststroke. Two of the 6 survival subjects were sacrificed following the 48-hour scanning at the recommendation of the veterinary staff. MR images were reviewed, and stroke volumes were
calculated from DWI by using a threshold of the mean ⫾ 2 SDs
with the contralateral side as a reference. Lesion volumes from
DWI were derived from the threshold (mean ⫾ 2 SDs) of the DWI
intensity on the contralateral side by using custom Matlab scripts

induction, requiring temporary or permanent elimination of collateral vessels. Published series of stroke and temporary ischemia
models have used open surgical, endovascular, or mixed techniques,4,9,13-16 many targeting collateral vessels as a means of decreasing cerebral flow. Management of collateral vessels is critical
in achieving cerebral blood flow below the infarct threshold of
approximately 0.12 mL/g per minute. While values above this
threshold may result in cessation of function, flow rates below this
level are required to achieve cell death within the targeted region.17 With this requirement in mind, our study used older subjects that could potentially have fewer collateral vessels; fewer col-

lateral vessels have been shown in both aging mice18 and humans
with proximal MCA occlusion.19
Hudgins and Garcia20 published an approach in 1970 consisting of orbital enucleation followed by MCA microclip placement
to regulate the degree of cerebral ischemia. This method is still
used, with the primary drawback being its invasive nature and
disallowance of thrombolytics used in current stroke therapy. Another approach used temporary clipping of the bilateral anterior
cerebral arteries and MCA for reducing collateral flow,12 and this
approach yielded relatively consistent cortical stroke volumes of
approximately 25% of the entire cortical volume. Comparatively,
our method is less invasive and avoids
the MR imaging artifacts due to surgical
clip placement.
A purely endovascular reversible
stroke model was published by Jungreis
et al21 by using permanent coiling of the
right posterior cerebral artery and temporary balloon occlusion at the junction
of the ICA terminus, anterior cerebral
artery, and MCA. The reversible nature
of this MCA-occlusion model used permanent coil occlusion of the posterior
cerebral artery, and the authors did not
comment on the actual stroke volumes
or survivability. A subsequent study using this model resulted in relatively large
infarct volumes with involvement of the
basal ganglia in a small nonsurvival
study.22 Our approach offers the advantage of basal ganglia sparing in 7 of 8
subjects and stroke volumes better
suited to survivability studies.
Other endovascular models used
temporary mechanical catheter occlusion, injection of n-butyl-cyanoacrylate
or other permanent agents.8 One disadvantage of these approaches is again inconsistent lesion sizes, though it may
reflect similar variation in human
stroke. Our endovascular approach resulted in stroke in the targeted territory in 100% of subjects with 100% 48hour survivability without procedural
complications or unintended strokes.
However, 2 of the intended survival
subjects were euthanized for compassionate rather than medical reasons at
the recommendation of the supervising veterinarian.

Stroke Induction and Survivability
RPF6 was the first subject in the survival cohort and developed a
small stroke in the right basal ganglia. Postrecovery, the subject
developed clinical seizure activity just before the 48-hour MR imaging scan and was euthanized immediately after the scan. The
imaging would suggest that the basal ganglia stroke location was
the most likely source of the seizure activity. While this type of
stroke is not uncommonly seen and routinely supported in human patients, the ability to care for the nonhuman primate in the
absence of an intensive care unit–type environment necessitated early sacrifice. Clinically, this was not unexpected because the overall rate of poststroke seizure in human patients
ranges from 4.4% to 11.1%,23,24 with approximately 3.1%25
developing poststroke seizure within the first 24 hours. Subsequently, the endovascular technique was modified slightly to
spare the basal ganglia in the remaining 5 survival subjects, and
no additional basal ganglia strokes were observed.
The other 5 survival subjects had purely cortical strokes without basal ganglia involvement and manifested seizure activity
with progression of stroke volumes. One survival subject was euthanized for compassionate reasons for symptoms of generalized
lethargy and diminished oral intake (an end point approved by
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee). Clinically, the
relatively large stroke in this subject is commonly seen and treated
in human patients; 15%–20% of patients require hospital care in
the intensive care unit.26 The remaining 4 survival subjects tolerated their strokes well and demonstrated consistent clinical grades
on the Spetzler grading scale. There was a trend toward increasing
infarct size between the 6- to 48-hour scans and the 48- to 96-hour

scans, with only the 6- to 96-hour infarct volume reaching statistical significance. Overall, there was no symptomatic worsening in
clinical examination findings from 24 to 48 hours for the survival
arm of the study. At the 96-hour mark, the remaining subjects
were in no clinical distress, which suggests that they could likely
have potentially survived for a longer period. Given our experimental and clinical results, longer survival periods would be facilitated by avoidance of basal ganglia strokes in addition to very
large stroke volumes.

Endovascular Trapping and Stroke Accuracy
Embolic silk suture has been described in the treatment of brain
AVMs and does not cause significant inflammatory change, making it suitable for use in a permanent stroke model.27,28 It is deliverable through a microcatheter, is MR imaging– compatible,
and has been previously used in the nonhuman primate model,
with the injection of very short segments of silk from the
proximal MCA with variable clinical and imaging results.6
Comparatively, our superselective trapping method results in
better survivability and more controlled stroke volumes and
localization.
Each of the 8 experimental strokes had positive DWI changes
located precisely between the selected distal M3 branch and the
pullback proximal M1 position of the endovascularly placed microcatheter. Although more technically demanding, placement of
the smaller 5-mm suture segments into the distal M3 segment of
the MCA effectively eliminates retrograde collateral flow in the
MCA branch. Similarly, placement of the proximal 10-mm
suture effectively traps the desired MCA segment more precisely than if the suture were injected from the proximal MCA
segment.
The need to spare the lenticulostriate arteries was shown by the
basal ganglia stroke/seizure in the first survival subject. The endovascular trapping technique was subsequently enhanced with no
additional basal ganglia strokes in the remaining 5 survival subjects. First-time seizures occur at a rate of up to 15% in patients
with clinical stroke,29 so it is not unexpected for seizures to occur
in our series. However, it is not practical to care for these types of
seizures in the animal care environment, and the subject was
euthanized to preserve its comfort in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Similarly, the second subject showed symptoms of generalized lethargy and diminished oral uptake that would be within the
expected scope of human stroke intermediate level care. Our
results suggest enhanced accuracy and stroke yield with better
basal ganglia sparing.

Our endovascular trapping modification of an existing suture-injection
stroke model allows rapid poststroke recovery. Accurate neurologic assessments can be performed immediately in
a noncritical care setting. This assessment results in improved survivability,
basal ganglia sparing, and consistency
compared with previously published
endovascular methods. Furthermore,

translational thrombolytic or neuroprotective therapies can be
evaluated; these evaluations are not possible with open neurosurgery and the resulting confounding postoperative factors.
Endovascular trapping offers a greater degree of precision for
stroke location and size. Although 1 limitation of our model is
that it uses a permanent agent, it could be easily adapted to a
temporary occlusion model if a suitable injectable agent were
identified.
