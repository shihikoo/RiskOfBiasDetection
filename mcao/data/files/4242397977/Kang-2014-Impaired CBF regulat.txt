Abstract—The correlation between temporal changes of
regional cerebral blood ﬂow (rCBF) and the severity of transient ischemic stroke in spontaneously hypertensive rats
(SHR) and Wistar–Kyoto rats (WKY) was investigated using
T2-, diﬀusion- and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging at six diﬀerent time points: before and during 1 h
of unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), 1 h
after reperfusion, and 1 day, 4 days and 7 days after MCAO.
rCBF values were measured in both hemispheres, and the
perfusion-deﬁcient lesion (PDL) was deﬁned as the area of
the brain with a 57% or more reduction in basal CBF. Within
the PDL, regions were further reﬁned as ischemic core
(rCBF = 0–6 mL/100 g/min), ischemic penumbra (rCBF =
6–15 mL/100 g/min) and benign oligemia (rCBF > 15 mL/
100 g/min). SHR and WKY had identical initial volume of
the PDLs (WKY: 32.52 ± 4.08% vs. SHR: 33.95 ± 3.68%;
P > 0.05) and the maximum rCBF measured within those
lesions (WKY: 38.20 ± 3.57 mL/100 g/min vs. SHR:
38.46 ± 6.22 mL/100 g/min; P > 0.05) during MCAO. However, in SHR virtually all of the PDL progressed to become
the ﬁnal ischemic lesion (33.02 ± 5.41%, P > 0.05), while
the ﬁnal ischemic lesion volume of WKY (12.62 ± 9.19%)
was signiﬁcantly smaller than their original PDL (P < 0.01)
and similar to the ischemic core (13.13 ± 2.96%, P > 0.05).
The region with the lowest range of rCBF was positively correlated with the ﬁnal ischemic lesion volume (r = 0.716,
P < 0.01). Both during ischemia and after reperfusion, rCBF
in either ipsilesional and contralesional brain hemispheres
of SHR could not be restored to pre-ischemic levels, and

INTRODUCTION
Hypertension is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke as
80% of patients suﬀering from acute ischemic stroke are
hypertensive (Leonardi-Bee et al., 2002). Among various
animal models of chronic arterial hypertension, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) shares many features
with human essential hypertension (Folkow, 1982;
Amenta et al., 2003). Therefore, SHR is relevant to stroke
research and has been widely used to evaluate the eﬀect
of hypertension on ischemic stroke (Takaba et al., 2004;
Yao and Nabika, 2012). SHR were developed by systematic inbreeding from Wistar–Kyoto rats (WKY), which are
commonly used as the normotensive control strain
(Okamoto and Aoki, 1963).
It is well known that the susceptibility to cerebral
ischemia is greater in SHR than that in WKY (Barone
et al., 1991; Dogan et al., 1998; Letourneur et al.,
2011). This increased vulnerability of SHR is frequently
explained by a deﬁcit in collateral circulation compared
to normotensive rats (Coyle, 1987; Grabowski et al.,
1993). Because chronic arterial hypertension induces
both structural and functional vascular alterations
(Iadecola and Davisson, 2008), hypertension has been
considered as the main factor contributing to increased
sensitivity of SHR. However, several studies suggested
that hypertension-independent genetic factors also contribute to the increased infarct volume in hypertensive
rats, because infarct volume was not diﬀerent among
SHR-related strains irrespective of the presence of hypertension (Gratton et al., 1998; Takaba et al., 2004; Lecrux
et al., 2007; Sakurai-Yamashita et al., 2010). In addition,
intrinsic vulnerability to stroke was observed in neurons
and glial cells of SHR and stroke-prone SHR (SHR-SP)
(Lecrux et al., 2007; Sakurai-Yamashita et al., 2010).
Therefore, the decreased blood supply arising from

hypertension-induced vascular changes may not be the
sole contributor of increased susceptibility to ischemic
stroke in SHR.
Previous studies showed that the reduction in cerebral
blood ﬂow (CBF) is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between
SHR and normotensive rats (WKY and Sprague–Dawley
rats) after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)
using a laser Doppler ﬂowmetry (LDF) technique (Dogan
et al., 1998; Lecrux et al., 2007). However, LDF only
allows measurements of relative changes in regional
CBF (rCBF) in a very limited volume of the cortex. In addition, due to the need to perform a craniotomy to allow
access of the LDF probe to the surface of the brain,
LDF makes longitudinal studies of rCBF diﬃcult to
implement. To circumvent this limitation while allowing
non-invasive assessment of stroke outcome, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) can be utilized. Nevertheless,
while there have been a few MRI studies aimed at understanding the underlying causes of the increased susceptibility of SHR to ischemic stroke (McCabe et al., 2009;
Henning et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011; Letourneur et al.,
2011), most of these investigations were performed in
the hyper-acute or acute phase of stroke and thus the
temporal changes of whole brain CBF after MCAO have
not been systematically evaluated in SHR.
In the present work, to further investigate the
contributing factors of the increased susceptibility of
SHR to brain ischemia, we used T2-, diﬀusion- and
perfusion-weighted MRI to examine the correlation
between temporal changes of whole-brain rCBF and the
severity of ischemic stroke in SHR and WKY at six
diﬀerent time points: before and during 1 h of MCAO,
1 h after reperfusion, and 1 day, 4 days and 7 days after
MCAO.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animal preparation
All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee of the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke and the National Institute on
Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, in
accordance with guidelines established by the National
Institutes of Health, and have been described in detail in
a previous publication (Kang et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, male,
adult WKY and SHR (13–17 weeks old, 250–350 g body
weight) were acquired from a commercial vendor (Harlan
Laboratories, Frederick, MD) in age-matched pairs, and
housed with a 12-h light–dark cycle under constant temperature conditions. The number of animals (n = 12, 6
per strain) was estimated to be the minimum necessary
to evaluate diﬀerences between two strains.
Animals were allowed to acclimate to the facility for a
minimum of 1 week prior to being used in the present
study. On the day of the surgery, each animal was
brought to the laboratory after being fasted overnight
and then anesthetized with isoﬂurane (5% induction,
2.5% maintenance of surgical plane), delivered via a
facemask in a 2:2:1 mixture of medical air, nitrogen, and
oxygen. Rectal temperature was monitored and kept at
37–38 °C using a thermostatically controlled heating pad

(Gaymar Industries Inc., Orchard Park, NY, USA). The
tail artery was catheterized to allow for periodic
sampling of arterial gases (ABL80 Flex, Radiometer
America Inc., Westlake, OH) and continuous monitoring
of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and heart rate
(Biopac Systems Inc., Goleta, CA, USA).
Focal cerebral ischemia
Transient occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery
(MCAO) was achieved by advancing a 4–0 siliconecoated nylon suture (Doccol Corporation, Redlands, CA,
USA) into the right internal carotid artery until resistance
was met (Longa et al., 1989). Reperfusion was achieved
by withdrawing the ﬁlament after 1-h occlusion. All
catheters were removed, the incisional wound was
sutured closed and the rats were allowed to recover consciousness prior to being brought back to their housing
facility.
Neurological evaluation
Neurological deﬁcits were assessed at 1, 4 and 7 days
after MCAO, as described previously (Barone et al.,
2001; Chu et al., 2008). An experienced observer who
was blinded to group assignment performed scoring of
postural reﬂexes, circling and proprioceptive placement
of contralateral forelimb and hindlimb, according to the
scale shown in Table 1 (Kang et al., 2012).
MRI
MRI was performed on a 7T/30 cm USR Avance III
spectrometer
(Bruker
Biospin
Corp.,
Ettlingen,
Germany), equipped with a 15-cm gradient set of 450
mT/m strength (Resonance Research Inc., Billerica, MA,
USA). For signal excitation, a home-built, transmit-only
birdcage volume RF coil, 12-cm internal diameter, was
used. For signal reception, a home-built single surface
coil, equipped with a dedicated RF preampliﬁer, was
used. For arterial spin labeling (ASL), a small home-built
labeling coil (Silva et al., 1995) was positioned under
the neck of the animal, approximately 2 cm away from
the magnet’s isocenter, and connected to the second
RF transmit channel of the spectrometer. All three RF
coils were equipped with active decoupling circuits to
prevent coil-to-coil interactions.
MR data were acquired at six serial time points: before
and during MCAO, 1 h after reperfusion, and 1, 4 and
7 days after MCAO. The animals were placed on an
MR-compatible cradle equipped with an MRI compatible
stereotaxic frame. Anesthesia was maintained at 2%
and animal physiology was continuously monitored by
end tidal CO2, heart rate, and SPO2 using a capnograph
and pulse oximeter (Surgivet, Waukesha, WI, USA).
Three MRI sequences were used: a T2-weighted (T2W)
sequence for anatomical imaging and delineation of
ischemic lesion volumes 24 h and later following MCAO;
a continuous ASL (CASL) sequence (Silva et al., 1995;
Leoni et al., 2011) for measurements of rCBF at all time
points; and a diﬀusion-weighed imaging (DWI) for measurements of regional apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcients

to cover the entire brain in 15  1-mm thick consecutive
coronal slices with an in-plane ﬁeld-of-view (FOV) of
25.6  25.6 mm2. Other MRI parameters were as follows.
For T2W, a rapidly acquired relaxation enhancement
(RARE) sequence with TR/TE = 12000/72 ms and
matrix = 128  128 was used. For DWI, a single-shot
spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) sequence with
TR/TE = 6000/30 ms, matrix = 64  64, and b-values =
0, 1600 s/mm2 acquired in three directions (x, y, z) was
used, from which ADC trace maps were estimated using
a computer software (DPTools, Denis Ducreux, Paris,
France). And for rCBF measurements, a multi-slice SEEPI sequence was used with TR/TE = 10,000/30 ms,
matrix = 64  64, and a labeling RF pulse of 8183 ms
applied in the presence of a longitudinal gradient
Gz = 1 G/cm at the appropriate labeling frequency oﬀset.
Intravascular contamination was attenuated by using a
post-labeling delay of 994 ms (Alsop and Detre, 1996).
Quantitative rCBF maps were obtained by subtraction of
the ASL images from control images using MATLAB
(The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Following the imaging studies (7 days post-stroke), all rats were euthanized
with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal
Sodium Solution, Akorn, Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA
100 mg/kg, IV).

to the contralesional side (benign oligemia) was
expressed as percentage of the hemispheric volume as
described previously (Drummond et al., 1989).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS
package (version 12.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Unpaired t-tests were used for comparison of the areas
of the three ranges of rCBF determined above.
Mann–Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon signed rank tests
were used to evaluate non-parametric data. A two-way
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
the Bonferroni post hoc test was used to compare
sequential changes of physiological parameters, lesion
volumes, brain edema, and rCBF between the two
strains. Pearson’s correlation was used to investigate
the relationship between the ﬁnal ischemic lesion
volume estimated 7 days after MCAO and rCBF of the
PDL and the PDL regions within three determined
ranges of rCBF. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at
P < 0.05.

Image analysis

Physiological parameters

Image analysis was also performed by the same expert,
who was blinded to group assignment, as previously
described (Kang et al., 2012), using MIPAV (Biomedical
Imaging Research Services Section, National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD). During MCAO, the ischemic
lesion was determined from the ADC maps using the criterion of 23% reduction in mean contralesional ADC
(McCabe et al., 2009). Following MCAO, ischemic lesion
volumes were determined from the T2W images by manual tracing of the hyperintense lesions. Brain edema and
the edema-corrected lesion volumes were calculated
and expressed as percentage of the hemispheric volume
(Gerriets et al., 2004). The perfusion-deﬁcient lesion
(PDL) was determined from the rCBF map obtained during MCAO, by using a 57% reduction relative to the contralesional side (Meng et al., 2004). Regions of interest
(ROI) outlining these areas were transferred to the corresponding rCBF maps obtained at diﬀerent time points
(before MCAO, 1 h after reperfusion, and 1, 4 and 7 days
after MCAO). rCBF values were measured within and outside the PDL and in the corresponding regions of the contralesional hemisphere. Within the PDL, the volume of the
ROI with rCBF decreased to three ranges (0–6 mL/100 g/

All 12 rats survived the surgical procedure and
participated in all measurements performed before and
during MCAO, after reperfusion, and at 1, 4 and 7 days
after stroke. In all rats, physiological parameters were
maintained within normal ranges before, during, and
after MCAO (Table 2). There were no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in physiological parameters between the two
strains, except for MABP, which was signiﬁcantly higher
in SHR than in WKY at each measurement time
(P < 0.05).
Evolution of ischemic lesion volumes and brain
edema
Ischemic lesion volumes as determined from ADC maps
and T2-weighted MRI were signiﬁcantly larger in SHR
than in WKY at each measurement time (Fig. 1;
P < 0.01). Already during the MCAO, the mean lesion
volume in SHR was 9.9% larger than in WKY, and the
diﬀerence between the two strains grew to 17.8% on
Day 1, 18.3% on Day 4 and 20.4% on Day 7. In both
strains, maximal lesion volumes were observed on Day
4 (WKY: 15.67 ± 10.99%, SHR: 33.97 ± 4.16%), but

During MCAO, the formation of brain edema was not
apparent in either strain, but it was clearly present on
Days 1 and 4 after reperfusion. The amount of edema
was signiﬁcantly higher in SHR than in WKY on Day 4
(Fig. 2; P < 0.01). On Day 7, the presence of edema
was strongly subdued in both strains and not diﬀerent
from the extent measured during MCAO (P > 0.05).
Across individuals, the variation of both lesion volume
and edema was smaller in SHR than that in WKY at
each measurement time.

midline caused by edema than WKY.

Evolution of neurological deﬁcits
In both strains, neurological deﬁcits were observed after
reperfusion. The neurological scores were highest on
Day 1 (WKY: 3.7 ± 3.1, SHR: 7 ± 0) and gradually
improved with time (Day 1 vs. Day 7: P < 0.05).
Neurological scores were signiﬁcantly higher in SHR
than in WKY at each measurement time (Days 1 and 4:
P < 0.05, Day 7: P < 0.01; Fig. 4). Across individuals,
the variation in neurological scores was smaller in SHR
than in WKY.

Evolution of rCBF
For both SHR and WKY strains, rCBF in the ipsilesional
hemisphere was evaluated within the PDL (Fig. 5A–1)
and in the region outside this lesion (Fig. 5A–2), as well
as in homologous regions of the contralesional
hemisphere (Fig. 5B–1, B–2, respectively). Fig. 5 Before
ischemia, baseline rCBF in SHR was signiﬁcantly higher
than in WKY in these four ROIs (WKY vs. SHR: P < 0.05).

in comparison with WKY during MCAO and at 1, 4 and 7 days after MCAO. In addition, while rCBF in both hemispheres was signiﬁcantly decreased
in SHR, higher values and rapid restoration of rCBF were observed in WKY. The scale bar expresses the CBF values in mL/100 g/min.

Fig. 4. Temporal evolution of neurological scores evaluated following
transient MCAO in WKY and SHR. Neurological deﬁcits were
signiﬁcantly higher in SHR compared to WKY, indicating an increased
susceptibility of SHR to brain ischemia in the acute phase of stroke.
Diﬀerences between two strains were signiﬁcant at the ⁄P < 0.05 and
⁄⁄
P < 0.01 levels (Mann–Whitney U-test).

Within the PDL (Fig. 5A–1), rCBF values measured
during MCAO were signiﬁcantly reduced to 30.6 ± 9.0%
(WKY) and 18.3 ± 2.5% (SHR) of their respective preischemic values (baseline rCBF vs. during MCAO:
P < 0.01). Because of the larger rCBF reduction in
SHR than in WKY, during ischemia the absolute rCBF
value in SHR was lower than in WKY (WKY:
24.4 ± 4.05 mL/100 g/min vs. SHR: 17.56 ± 3.4 mL/
100 g/min; P < 0.05). One hour after reperfusion, WKY
exhibited a complete recovery of rCBF to pre-ischemic
values (baseline vs. reperfusion: P > 0.05), while in
SHR full recovery of baseline rCBF values did not occur

until Day 4 following stroke (baseline vs. reperfusion:
P < 0.05, baseline vs. Day 1: P < 0.01). Therefore,
rCBF values within the ischemic lesion remained higher
in WKY rats than in SHR during reperfusion (P < 0.05)
and Day 1 (P < 0.01), but this diﬀerence disappeared
on Day 4 and Day 7 (P > 0.05).
Outside the PDL (Fig. 5A–2), there were no rCBF
changes in WKY for all measurement times (baseline
vs. during MCAO, reperfusion, Days 1, 4, and 7:
P > 0.05). On the other hand, SHR presented a
signiﬁcant rCBF reduction from its pre-ischemic value
during MCAO (baseline vs. during MCAO: P < 0.05)
that did not recover until Day 4 (baseline vs. Day 1:
P < 0.05), indicating a failure of the collateral circulation
from anterior cerebral artery (ACA)–MCA anastomoses
to sustain rCBF outside the ischemic region. This failure
was only present in SHR and not in WKY, and it was
large enough that rCBF in WKY was signiﬁcantly higher
than that in SHR 1 h after reperfusion (P < 0.05) and
on Day 1 (P < 0.01). The diﬀerence in collateral rCBF
between SHR and WKY was only resolved after Day 4
(P > 0.05).
When rCBF was measured in corresponding regions
of the contralesional hemisphere (Fig. 5B), WKY rats
showed no signiﬁcant changes from pre-ischemic values
(baseline vs. during MCAO, reperfusion, Days 1, 4, and
7: P > 0.05). On the other hand, contralesional rCBF in
SHR was signiﬁcantly decreased from its pre-ischemic
value during MCAO (baseline vs. during MCAO:
P < 0.05), and remained decreased until Day 1
(baseline vs. Day 1: P < 0.05), so that absolute rCBF
values in SHR were lower than in WKY after reperfusion

vs.
SHR:
38.46 ± 6.22 mL/100 g/min;
P > 0.05) during MCAO were not diﬀerent between the
two strains (Fig. 6), indicating that the territory of the
MCA was the main determinant of the initial lesion
volume. However, within this initial PDL, the region with
the lowest rCBF range (0–6 mL/100 g/min) was
signiﬁcantly larger in SHR than in WKY (WKY:
13.28 ± 2.28% vs. SHR: 17.8 ± 2.15%; P < 0.0001),
while the region with the highest rCBF range (15 mL/
100 g/min to 57% reduction relative to the contralesional
side) was signiﬁcantly smaller in SHR than in WKY

strains in the region with the middle rCBF range
(6–15 mL/100 g/min) (P > 0.05).
There was no correlation between rCBF measured
within the PDL during MCAO and the ﬁnal ischemic
lesion volume measured 7 days after MCAO
(r = 0.443, P > 0.05). However the region with the
lowest range of rCBF was positively correlated with the
ﬁnal ischemic lesion volume (r = 0.716, P < 0.01).
Interestingly, the ﬁnal ischemic lesion volume of WKY
was not diﬀerent from the volume of the region with the
lowest rCBF range during MCAO (volume of the regions
with the lowest rCBF: 13.13 ± 2.96% vs. ﬁnal ischemic
lesion volume: 12.62 ± 9.19%; P > 0.05). By contrast,
the ﬁnal ischemic lesion volume of SHR was
signiﬁcantly larger than the region with the lowest range
of rCBF (volume of region with the lowest rCBF:
17.5 ± 2.13% vs. ﬁnal ischemic lesion volume:
33.02 ± 5.41%; P < 0.0001).

DISCUSSION
The present study shows that impaired collateral blood
ﬂow, higher CBF threshold and prolonged impairment in
cerebrovascular autoregulation in SHR after ischemic
stroke are major contributing factors for the larger
ischemic lesion volumes observed in this strain. While
most of the PDL progressed to become the ﬁnal
ischemic lesion in SHR, in normotensive WKY rats the
ﬁnal ischemic lesion volume was signiﬁcantly smaller
than the PDL and similar to the region with the lowest
rCBF range. Both during ischemia and after reperfusion,
rCBF in either ipsilesional and contralesional brain
hemispheres of SHR could not be restored to
pre-ischemic levels, and remained lower than in WKY
until up to 4 days after MCAO.
Collateral circulation, deﬁned as the supplementary
vascular network that maintains rCBF when the main
blood vessels fail, is a major defense mechanism of the
brain against stroke (Liebeskind, 2003). Collateral circulation is formed from anastomoses between all types of
blood vessels, providing an alternative route for blood to
reach brain tissue when the principal supply or drainage
are compromised. Collateral circulation greatly contributes to the outcome of ischemia, because it prevents tissue infarction if ﬂow is maintained above the critical level.
The luminal width of collateral vessels is a major determinant of blood ﬂow into the territory of the occluded artery
by collateral circulation (Coyle and Heistad, 1991).
Because SHR have smaller internal diameter of collateral
vessels than normotensive rats, reduced collateral circulation through the narrowed and stiﬀ vessels of hypertensive rats has been considered as a major contributing
factor to increased susceptibility of cerebral ischemia
(Coyle, 1987; Grabowski et al., 1993). The present data
corroborate the previous ﬁndings.
Using the criterion of a 57% reduction in rCBF
measured during MCAO relative to the contralesional
side (Meng et al., 2004), we observed that SHR had identical PDL volumes to WKY rats during the occlusion. However, already at that time point the ADC maps predicted a
signiﬁcantly larger lesion volume in SHR (smaller

229

diﬀusion-perfusion mismatch), indicating that both within
and outside the PDL collateral ﬂow was not able to compensate for the perfusion deﬁcit. Two previous studies
explained the increased susceptibility of cerebral ischemia in SHR-related strains using the diﬀusion-perfusion
mismatch method, because hypertensive strains had a
signiﬁcantly smaller ischemic penumbra than WKY on
MR images (McCabe et al., 2009; Letourneur et al.,
2011). However, they could not pinpoint the exact cause
of the diﬀerence in mismatch between normotensive
and hypertensive strains. The smaller mismatch volume
of SHR than WKY during MCAO was reproduced in the
present study. Much of the perfusion-diﬀusion mismatch
in SHR occurred in the dorsolateral cortex, in the border
between the territories of the MCA and the ACA.
Previously we showed that the ACA territory has large
variability in both WKY and SHR rats, and that WKY rats
show more variations of the ACA territory than SHR
(Leoni et al., 2012). This limited ﬂexibility of the ACA territory in SHR may explain its failure to compensate for
perfusion deﬁcits in the MCA territory during stroke.
The quantitative CBF measurements performed in the
present study demonstrated that SHR showed a larger
drop in CBF during ischemia than normotensive rats,
and lacked the capacity to restore CBF to pre-ischemic
values following reperfusion, providing further evidence
for the compromised collateral ﬂow to respond to
ischemia in the hypertensive strain. While in WKY rats
the decreased blood ﬂow due to ischemia was spatially
conﬁned to within the perfusion-deﬁcient region and it
was immediately restored to its pre-ischemic value upon
reperfusion, in SHR there was a global decrease in CBF
that extended to the contralesional hemisphere. Chronic
hypertension in SHR leads to vascular remodeling,
including hypertrophy of the arterial wall, eutrophy of the
arterial lumen and stiﬀening of the blood vessels
(Amenta et al., 2003). Such remodeling strongly impairs
autoregulation (Fujishima et al., 1984; Harper et al.,
1984), and we demonstrated here that this impairment
was not resolved until 4 days after reperfusion. The present data suggest that the impaired CBF autoregulation in
both ipsilesional and contralesional hemispheres contribute not only to the decreased collateral circulation in
SHR, but also lead to a larger ischemic lesion volume
and worse neurological deﬁcits compared to the normotensive rats.
In the present study, the region with the lowest CBF
range was signiﬁcantly smaller in WKY than in SHR and
not diﬀerent from the ﬁnal ischemic lesion volume,
which was signiﬁcantly smaller than the ﬁnal ischemic
lesion volume in SHR. These ﬁndings suggest that the
CBF threshold for ischemia is higher in SHR than in
WKY, and explain the exacerbated ischemic lesion on
the ADC map and smaller mismatch volumes in SHR. In
a previous study, the CBF threshold for SHR was
around 50 mL/100 g/min when ischemia persisted for
more than 3 h (Jacewicz et al., 1992). In the present
study, the maximum rCBF measured in SHR within the
PDL (38.46 ± 6.22 mL/100 g/min) was lower than
50 mL/100 g/min and the PDL volume was not diﬀerent
from the ﬁnal ischemic lesion volume. On the other hand,

230

in WKY, the PDL volume was signiﬁcantly larger than the
ﬁnal ischemic lesion volume, even though the maximum
rCBF (38.20 ± 3.57 mL/100 g/min) and the PDL volume
in WKY were not diﬀerent from those in SHR. Based on
these present ﬁndings, we postulate that the CBF threshold for ischemia in WKY and SHR following a 1-h MCAO
is about 6 and 38 mL/100 g/min, respectively.
Even though a failure of collateral circulation has been
suggested as the primary cause for the SHR’s increased
susceptibility to stroke, it is important to notice that the
development of structural vascular alterations appear to
involve genetic components that are phenotypically
expressed regardless of the presence of hypertension
(Barone et al., 1992; Mies et al., 1999). For example,
genetic abnormalities in the SHR-SP strain are associated with diﬀuse vascular processes resulting in global
decompensation of CBF that could be detected before
the manifestation of brain ischemia (Mies et al., 1999).
In addition, several studies have suggested that exacerbated ischemic lesion of SHR-related strains is independent of arterial hypertension and that their increased
susceptibility to ischemia is merely due to the intrinsic
characteristics of those strains (Honda et al., 1990;
Yang and Raizada, 1998; Yamagata et al., 2000;
Veerasingham et al., 2005). In the present study, SHR
had smaller collateral circulation and higher CBF threshold than WKY. The relative contribution of each deﬁcit
to the increased susceptibility of SHR to ischemia needs
to be further investigated in larger sized cohorts of
animals.
