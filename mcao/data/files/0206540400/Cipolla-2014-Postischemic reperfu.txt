Background and Purpose—Parenchymal arterioles (PAs) are high-resistance vessels in the brain that connect pial vessels to
the microcirculation. We previously showed that PAs have increased vasoconstriction after ischemia and reperfusion that
could increase perfusion deficit. Here, we investigated underlying mechanisms by which early postischemic reperfusion
causes increased vasoconstriction of PAs.
Methods—Isolated and pressurized PAs from within the middle cerebral artery territory were studied in male Wistar rats that
were either nonischemic control (n=34) or after exposure to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) by filament
occlusion for 2 hours with 30 minutes of reperfusion (MCAO; n=38). The relationships among pressure-induced tone, smooth
muscle calcium (using Fura 2), and membrane potential were determined. Sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to calcium
was measured in permeabilized arterioles using Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin. Reactivity to inhibition of transient receptor
potential melastanin receptor type 4 (9-phenanthrol), Rho kinase (Y27632), and protein kinase C (Gö6976) was also measured.
Results—After MCAO, PAs had increased myogenic tone compared with controls (47±2% versus 35±2% at 40 mm Hg;
P<0.01), without an increase in smooth muscle calcium (177±21 versus 201±16 nmol/L; P>0.05) or membrane
depolarization (−38±4 versus −36±1 mV; P>0.05). In α-toxin–permeabilized vessels, MCAO caused increased sensitivity
of the contractile apparatus to calcium. MCAO did not affect dilation to transient receptor potential melastanin receptor
type 4 or protein kinase C inhibition but diminished dilation to Rho kinase inhibition.
Conclusions—The increased vasoconstriction of PAs during early postischemic reperfusion seems to be due to calcium
sensitization of smooth muscle and could contribute to infarct expansion and limit neuroprotective agents from reaching
their target tissue.   (Stroke. 2014;45:2425-2430.)

circulations in response to postischemic reperfusion including
the coronary circulation and is thought to be a major contributor to ischemic tissue injury.13 Importantly, a recent study in
patients with stroke found that reperfusion was a more accurate
predictor of final infarct volume than recanalization.4 The dissociation between recanalization and reperfusion is not entirely
clear and may be because of distal embolization of thrombus or incomplete reperfusion of the brain parenchyma.14,15
Incomplete postischemic reperfusion has been mostly attributed to microcirculatory disturbances,14 including perivascular
glial cell swelling that occludes capillaries6,16 and clogging of
capillaries by microthrombi and immune cells.5,7,17,18 However,
evidence from earlier studies also suggests that upstream vasoconstriction and increased cerebrovascular resistance occur in
no-reflow zones.8–10,19 More recently, Shih et al20 used 2-photon microscopy to measure red blood cell flux and diameters of
penetrating brain arterioles during early postischemic reperfusion and found both flux and diameters to be decreased below

estoration of blood flow to the ischemic brain is the most
potent and efficacious means to improve outcome from
ischemic stroke. Recanalization therapies, such as thrombolysis
and mechanical removal or disruption of the clot, have shown
clear benefit if reperfusion occurs within a narrow time window
of ≈4.5 hours.1,2 However, recanalization after this time period
can cause deleterious effects including hemorrhagic transformation and edema that worsens outcome.1–3 Thus, early postischemic reperfusion to the brain parenchyma is one of the most
important treatments for acute ischemic stroke.
Studies in animals and humans have shown that recanalization of an occluded artery does not necessarily lead to complete reperfusion or improvement of outcome.4–7 Incomplete
microcirculatory reperfusion occurs in response to both global
and focal ischemia in the brain and may be a primary factor
that increases perfusion deficit, decreases efficacy of early
thrombolysis, and limits neuroprotective agents from reaching
their target.5,8–12 This no-reflow phenomenon occurs in other

baseline, suggesting vasoconstriction occurs during reperfusion
that may contribute to incomplete restoration of blood flow.
Our own studies using isolated and pressurized parenchymal arterioles have shown that these vessels have increased
vasoconstriction in response to early postischemic reperfusion.21 Although this previous study mainly focused on endothelial cell changes, we found that vascular smooth muscle
was also more contractile after ischemia and reperfusion.21 In
the present study, we investigated mechanisms by which vascular smooth muscle of parenchymal arterioles has increased
vasoconstriction compared with nonischemic vessels, focusing on the relationship among myogenic tone, smooth muscle
calcium, and membrane potential. Understanding this relationship may provide a therapeutic target to improve blood
flow to the ischemic brain during reperfusion.

Animal Model of Transient Focal Ischemia
Experiments were performed using male Wistar rats (Harlan) that
were ≈350 to 380 g. All procedures involving animals were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University
of Vermont and complied with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Rats were housed in the
Animal Care Facility at the University of Vermont, an Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–accredited
facility, and were allowed food and water ad libitum. Proximal middle
cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed using the filament
technique, as previously described.21 Animals were anesthetized with
isoflurane (1.5% in oxygen) and intubated and mechanically ventilated to maintain blood gases within a normal physiological range (Table
I in the online-only Data Supplement). The MCA was occluded for 2
hours followed by suture removal for 30 minutes. Animals were randomized to sham, naive, or MCAO group, and individuals performing
the experiments were blinded to group and outcome. Animals were
excluded if the drop in cerebral blood flow was <60% from baseline.
Sham control animals underwent anesthesia for 2.5 hours and received
a midline neck incision, but no filament was inserted.

Preparation of Isolated Parenchymal Arterioles
and the Relationship Between Myogenic
Vasoconstriction and Smooth Muscle Calcium
Animals were decapitated under isoflurane anesthesia and the brain
removed and placed in cold physiological saline solution (PSS).
Parenchymal arterioles (PAs), branching off the MCA at right angles
and penetrating into the brain tissue, were dissected and mounted in
an arteriograph chamber, as previously described.21 Myogenic activity
was compared between control (n=12) and MCAO (n=12) arterioles
by measuring diameter and tone at pressures from 40 to 80 mm Hg.
To investigate the relationship between myogenic tone and calcium in
PAs from control animals (n=6) and after MCAO (n=6), the calciumsensitive dye, Fura 2-acetoxymethyl ester, was used, as previously described22 and in the online-only Data Supplement. Arteriolar diameter
and calcium were simultaneously recorded using IonWizard software
(IonOptix). Briefly, PAs were pressurized to 40 mm Hg and equilibrated for 30 minutes to allow spontaneous development of myogenic
tone. Changes in smooth muscle calcium and diameter were evaluated
by stepwise increases in pressure from 40 to 80 mm Hg. At the conclusion of the experiment, diltiazem (10 μmol/L) in calcium-free PSS
was added to obtain fully relaxed diameters.

Smooth Muscle Membrane Potential Measurement
Myogenic tone and smooth muscle membrane potential were simultaneously measured in isolated and pressurized PAs from sham control
animals (n=5) and after MCAO (n=5), as previously described.23,24
Smooth muscle membrane potential was measured by insertion of a

sharp glass microelectrode (≈100 mol/LΩ resistance) filled with 0.5
mol/L KCl into the vessel wall. Impalement was considered successful if there was an abrupt deflection to negative membrane potential
on electrode entry, membrane potential was stable for ≥30 s, and the
voltage returned abruptly to 0 mV on removal of the electrode.23,24
Membrane potential measurements were made with an electrometer (World Precision Instruments) and recorded via computer with
Axotape and Dataq software.

Measurement of Calcium Sensitivity in
Permeabilized Arterioles Using Staphylococcus
aureus α-Toxin
The sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to calcium in arterioles
from control animals (n=6) and after MCAO (n=7) was determined
by permeabilizing the myocyte membrane with S aureus α-toxin and
measuring the contractile response to addition of calcium, as previously described22 and in the online-only Data Supplement. S aureus
α-toxin forms small (1–2 nm diameter) pores in the plasma membrane that allows ions but not proteins to pass. This technique is
commonly used to study calcium sensitization because under these
conditions intracellular calcium in smooth muscle can be tightly controlled. Briefly, PAs were carefully dissected and mounted in an arteriograph filled with HEPES-buffered PSS, pressurized to 40 mm Hg,
and equilibrated for 30 minutes. Vessels were permeabilized with S
aureus α-toxin (800 U/mL) in relaxing solution at room temperature for 20 minutes. The S aureus α-toxin was then washed from the
bath, and vessels were equilibrated in relaxing solution at 37°C for
30 minutes. The vasoactive response to calcium was determined by
replacing relaxing solution with activating solution containing known
concentrations of free ionic calcium (pCa or −log [Ca]: 7.0-6.0). For
each concentration of calcium, the inner diameters were recorded
once stable (5–7 minutes).

Reactivity of PAs to 9-Phenanthrol, Y27632,
and Gö6976
In a separate set of PAs from sham control animals (n=6) or after
MCAO (n=7), dilator responses to the transient receptor potential
melastanin receptor type 4 (TRPM4) inhibitor, 9-phenanthrol, were
determined. Arterioles were dissected and mounted in an arteriograph
chamber, equilibrated at 40 mm Hg, and an air bubble passed through
the lumen to remove the endothelium. Endothelial denudation was
confirmed by lack of dilation to NS309. 9-Phenanthrol was cumulatively added to the bath and lumen diameters measured at each
concentration, once stable. In a separate set of arterioles that were
intact (not denuded of endothelium) from control animals (n=6) or
after MCAO (n=6), reactivity to inhibitors of Rho kinase (Y27632)
and protein kinase C (PKC; Gö6976) was determined by cumulative
addition to the bath and measuring diameters at each concentration.
Y27632 is a selective inhibitor of rho-associated protein kinase 1
(ROCK1) (IC50=140 nmol/L) that exhibits >200-fold selectivity over
other kinases, including PKC and myosin light chain kinase. Gö6976
is a selective inhibitor of conventional PKCα (IC50=2.3 nmol/L) and
PKCβ (IC50=6.2 nmol/L) and does not inhibit unconventional PKC
isoforms (PKCδ, PKCγ, or PKCε).

Drugs and Solutions
All isolated vessel experiments, except calcium sensitivity measurements in S aureus α-toxin, were performed using a bicarbonate-based
Ringer’s PSS, the ionic composition of which was (in mmol/L)
NaCl 119.0, NaHCO3 24.0, KCl 4.7, KH2PO4 1.18, MgSO4×7H2O
1.17, CaCl2 1.6, EDTA 0.026, and glucose 5.5. PSS was made each
week and stored without glucose at 4°C. Glucose was added to the
PSS before each experiment. PSS was aerated with 5% CO2, 10%
O2, and 85% N2 to maintain pH. S aureus α-toxin was purchased
from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and aliquoted in relaxing buffer and
stored at −20°C until use. All other chemicals were purchased from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Please see the online-only Data Supplement
for details on Fura 2 measurements.

Results
Effect of Early Postischemic Reperfusion on
Myogenic Tone and Smooth Muscle Calcium
Figure 1 shows the relationship between myogenic tone and
smooth muscle calcium in PAs from control animals and
after transient MCAO. One vessel from control animals was
excluded for technical reasons. Unlike pial arteries that have
been shown to have diminished myogenic tone after postischemic reperfusion,25 PAs were smaller in diameter (Figure 1A)
because of increased myogenic tone (Figure 1B). Passive
diameters were not different between groups (data not shown).
Interestingly, there was no difference in smooth muscle calcium in arterioles after MCAO despite greater vasoconstriction
(Figure 1C). When the level of tone was plotted as a function
of calcium concentration for both groups of vessels, arterioles
after MCAO had greater tone for the same level of calcium
(Figure 1D). For example, at ≈200 nmol/L calcium arterioles
from control animals had 32±2% tone, whereas arterioles that
were exposed to transient MCAO had 48±4% tone (P<0.01).

Effect of Early Postischemic Reperfusion on Smooth
Muscle Membrane Potential and TRPM4 Activity
The increase in tone in parenchymal arterioles after MCAO
could be because of greater pressure-induced depolarization
and activation of voltage-dependent calcium channel activity.
To test this possibility, we simultaneously measured smooth
muscle membrane potential and tone of isolated arterioles
pressurized to 40 mm Hg. Figure 2A shows the relationship
between myogenic tone and smooth muscle membrane potential. PAs exposed to postischemic reperfusion had increased
tone, but this was not a result of greater smooth muscle depolarization because membrane potential of arterioles from
the 2 groups was similar and close to the values observed
in these vessels previously under control conditions.23 We
also tested the possibility that greater activation of TRPM4,
a mechanosensitive ion channel that promotes depolarization
in response to pressure,26 could account for the increased tone
of PAs after MCAO. Figure 2B shows that both types of arterioles dilated to TRPM4 inhibition, but there was no difference in sensitivity to 9-phenanthrol, suggesting MCAO did
not affect these channels.

preparation was used. The use of S aureus α-toxin effectively
eliminates the contribution of plasma membrane ion channels
and measures the contractile response to addition of calcium.22
Figure 3A shows that arterioles after MCAO had increased
tone at calcium concentrations ≥0.3 μmol/L. Figure 3A also
shows that after MCAO, PAs were physically more constricted
compared with controls at the highest level of calcium. When
calcium sensitivity was compared between the 2 groups of
arterioles (Figure 3B), there was an increase in calcium sensitivity after MCAO. The effective concentration that produced
half-maximal constriction (EC50) was significantly less for
arterioles after MCAO than controls.

Effect of Early Postischemic Reperfusion on
Reactivity to Rho Kinase and PKC Inhibition
To begin to investigate the mechanism by which calcium
sensitization occurs in arterioles after MCAO, the sensitivity to inhibition of ROCK and PKC was compared between
groups. Figure 4A shows the sensitivity of PAs in response
to ROCK inhibition with Y27632. Both types of arterioles dilated in response to Y27632; however, after MCAO
arterioles were less sensitive to its effects. Figure 4A also
shows that the IC20 value for Y27632 was significantly
larger in arterioles after MCAO. We compared the IC20 values because at these concentrations Y27632 is not likely to
be inhibiting other kinases that also promote vasodilation
such as PKC or myosin light chain kinase because the IC50
for this compound is 140 nmol/L. In contrast, inhibition of
PKCα and PKCβ with Gö6976 had little effect on either
vessel type. Figure 4B shows there was almost no change in
diameter in response to Gö6976, regardless of exposure to
ischemia and reperfusion.

Discussion
In the present study, we show that after early postischemic
reperfusion, PAs had increased pressure-induced tone that was
not because of smooth muscle membrane depolarization or
increased cell calcium but was related to an increase in calcium
sensitivity. In fact, the capacity of PAs to constrict in response
to calcium was also increased after MCAO, suggesting that
other vasoconstrictor mechanisms (eg, endothelin-1) may also
be enhanced. Increased vasoconstriction after ischemia and
reperfusion has been shown previously in these arterioles,9,19–21
a response that is distinct from that of pial arteries that undergo
vasodilation and decreased tone.25 However, this is the first
study we are aware of to investigate the underlying mechanism
by which increased vasoconstriction of PAs occurs with ischemia and reperfusion. Although capillary disturbances are well
known to occur after ischemia and reperfusion that can limit
reperfusion,5–7,17,18 upstream vasoconstriction of PAs may be
another factor that contributes to heterogeneity of tissue recovery and incomplete perfusion.
This study focused on smooth muscle cell calcium and
changes in membrane potential as underlying mechanisms
by which myogenic tone could be increased in PAs after
ischemia and reperfusion because it is well established
that pressure induces membrane depolarization that opens
voltage-dependent calcium channel to cause vasoconstriction.24 Thus, one means by which tone could be increased
is through greater smooth muscle depolarization and
increased cell calcium. However, we found that despite
increased tone, smooth muscle calcium was not elevated
compared with control vessels (177±21 nmol/L in MCAO
versus 201±16 nmol/L in control; P>0.05). In addition,
membrane potential of PAs pressurized to 40 mm Hg was

not different (−38±4 mV in MCAO versus −36±1 mV in
control; P>0.05). These values are in agreement with what
has been published by our group previously in control arterioles pressurized to 40 mm Hg (−35±1 mV).23 In addition,
sensitivity to 9-phenanthrol, a selective TRPM4 inhibitor,
dilated both types of PAs to a similar extent, suggesting that
a difference in TRPM4 activity in response to pressure was
not the underlying cause by which ischemia and reperfusion
increased tone in PAs.
The findings described above suggest that the contractile
apparatus of smooth muscle from PAs after ischemia and
reperfusion may be more sensitive to calcium such that less
calcium was needed to cause vasoconstriction at the same
level of pressure. To measure calcium sensitivity directly, we
used a permeabilized vessel preparation that eliminated the
role of membrane potential and ionic fluxes and allowed direct
and controlled access of calcium to the contractile apparatus.
Calcium sensitization of smooth muscle occurs via several
mechanisms, including phosphorylation of myosin light chain
kinase by PKC, decreased myosin phosphatase activity, and
increased Rho A–induced actin polymerization.27,28 We therefore compared the vasoactive response of arterioles with both
ROCK and PKC inhibition. PKC inhibition with Gö6976, a
conventional PKC inhibitor, had little effect on basal tone of
PAs, regardless of ischemia and reperfusion, suggesting PKC
activation was not involved in calcium sensitization with
MCAO. Conversely, ROCK inhibition with Y27632 caused
significant vasodilation in both vessel types, confirming our
previous study and others that the Rho A–ROCK pathway is
involved in myogenic tone in these arterioles.22,29,30 However,
sensitivity to Y27632 was decreased in arterioles after MCAO,
suggesting ROCK was less activated and contributes less to
tone in those arterioles and may not be the mechanism by
which calcium sensitization occurs after ischemia and reperfusion either. Calcium sensitization by ROCK depends on its
phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 at
Thr696 and Thr853 to suppress myosin light chain phosphatase
activity.31 However, other kinases such as zipper-interacting
protein kinase and integrin-linked kinase also have the ability to phosphorylate myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 at
Thr696.32,33 The role of these kinases in calcium sensitization of
PAs after MCAO clearly needs to be addressed with additional
biochemical studies.

Conclusions
We show that PAs supplying the subcortical brain regions and
striatum have increased vasoconstriction in response to early
postischemic reperfusion, which could limit perfusion to these
vulnerable brain regions including white matter. This seems
to be because of ischemia and reperfusion–induced smooth
muscle calcium sensitization. The main target of acute stroke
treatment is the ischemic penumbra and peri-infarcted tissue—
regions where the brain tissue is not dead and where reperfusion and neuroprotective agents can still provide benefit.
Without restoration of blood flow, tissue within the penumbra
dies and the core infarct expands to include the penumbra.34
Understanding the mechanisms by which postischemic reperfusion preferentially promotes vasoconstriction of PAs is of

interest to acute stroke treatment, because vasoconstriction
in these vessels under these conditions would not seem to
be beneficial. Therapeutic interventions opposing parenchymal arteriolar constriction during reperfusion should enhance
local blood flow and aid recovery and delivery of neuroprotective agents to the penumbra.

Supplemental Methods
Measurement of Smooth Muscle Calcium using Fura 2
Fura 2-AM (1 mmol/L stock dissolved in anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO) was premixed
with an equal volume of 25% pluronic acid dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in aerated
physiologic saline solution (PSS) to yield a final concentration of 5µmol/L. Each vessel segment
was cannulated in an arteriograph, pressurized to 10 mm Hg, and equilibrated at 37 °C for 10–15
min. The arteriolar segments were then incubated in the Fura 2-AM/PSS loading solution at
room temperature in the dark for 60 minutes. This solution was changed for freshly aerated
loading solution after 30 minutes into the incubation period to maintain pH = 7.4. Fura 2-loaded
arterioles were washed two to three times with PSS and then continuously superfused at 3
ml/min with oxygenated PSS (10% O2-5% CO2-balanced N2) at 37 °C. All experimental
protocols were started after an additional 15-min equilibration period at 10 mm Hg to allow
intracellular de-esterification of Fura 2-AM. Fura 2 fluorescence was measured using a
photomultiplier system (IonOptix) in which background-corrected ratios of 510-nm emission
were obtained at a sampling rate of 5 Hz from arteries alternately excited at 340 and 380 nm.
For the Fura 2 calibration procedure, the following solutions were used. Calcium-free
calibration solution was composed of (in mmol/L): KCl 140.0, NaCl 20.0, HEPES 5.0, EGTA
5.0, MgCl2 1.0, 5 µmol/L nigericin, and 10 µmol/L ionomycin. Calcium-containing calibration
solution was composed of (mmol/L): KCl 140.0, NaCl 20.0, HEPES 5.0, MgCl2 1.0, and CaCl2
10.0. Both solutions were adjusted to pH 7.15 at 37 °C with KOH. Ionomycin and nigericin
were purchased from A.G. Scientific (San Diego, CA). Fura 2-AM and pluronic acid were
purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). Fura 2-AM was dissolved in dehydrated
DMSO as a 1 mmol/L stock solution and frozen at -20 °C until use.
The concentration of intracellular calcium in vascular smooth muscle ([Ca2+]i) in intact
(not permeabilized) arterioles was calculated using the following equation: [Ca2+]i = Kdβ(R Rmin)/(Rmax - R), where Kd is the dissociation constant of Fura 2, R is experimentally measured
ratio (340/380 nm) of fluorescence intensities, Rmin is the ratio in the absence of [Ca2+]i, Rmax is
the ratio at Ca2+ saturation, and β is the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at 380-nm excitation
wavelength at Rmin and Rmax. Rmin, Rmax, and β were determined using an in situ calibration
procedure with nigericin (5 µmol/L) and ionomycin (10 µmol/L). These values were then used to
convert the ratio values into a [Ca2+]i. The calibration procedure resulted in a β value of 4.43 ±
0.28 and Rmin and Rmax values of 0.55 ± 0.02 and 4.12 ± 0.26. The Kd was 282 nmol/L, as
determined by using in situ titration of Ca2+ in Fura 2-loaded posterior cerebral arteries.1 Arterial
diameter, pressure, and ratio values were recorded using an Ion Wizard data acquisition program.

Measurement of sensitivity of parenchymal arterioles to calcium using S. aureus α-toxin
HEPES-buffered PSS contained (in mmol/L): NaCl 142.0, KCl 4.7, MgSO4 1.17, EDTA 0.5,
CaCl2 2.79, HEPES 10.0, KH2PO4 1.2, glucose 5.5. pH was adjusted by 10 N NaOH to 7.4 at 37
°C. Relaxing solution contained (in mmol/L): potassium methanesulfonate 63.6, MgCl 2 2.0, MgATP 4.5, EGTA 2.0, phosphocreatine 10.0, and piperazine-N,N’-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) 30.0.
Relaxing solution also contained 1.0 µmol/L carbonylcyanide p-trifluromethoxyphenylhydrazone, a mitochondrial blocker, and 1.0 µmol/L leupeptin, a protease inhibitor. pH was
adjusted to 7.1 with 8 N KOH. The composition of the activating solution was similar to that of
the relaxing solution, except it contained 10 mmol/L EGTA and 10 µmol/L GTP. The amount of
CaCl2 needed to yield the desired free ionic concentration of calcium in the activating solution
was
calculated
by
a
web-based
program
Webmaxc
Standard
(http://www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/webmaxcS.htm). Ionic strength was kept at 200 mmol/L by
adjusting the concentration of potassium methanesulfonate.
Data Calculations
Myogenic tone was calculated as a percent decrease in diameter from the fully relaxed diameter
in calcium-free PSS with diltiazem or in calcium-free relaxing solution by the equation: (1(φtone/φzero))*100%; where φtone = inner diameter of vessel with tone and φzero= inner diameter in
calcium-free PSS with diltiazem. Percent sensitivity to calcium was calculated from the
equation: ((φcalcium-φstart)/(φ6.0 – φstart)) x 100% where φ7.00 is the inner diameter at –log 7.0
calcium, φstart is diameter prior to giving the first concentration of calcium and φ6.00 is the inner
diameter at –log 6.0 calcium which was the highest concentration of calcium. Percent dilation to
9-phenanthrol, Y27632 and Gö6976 was calculated from the equation: ((φstart-φdrug)/(φstart – φzero
Ca)) x 100% where φdrug is the inner diameter at a specific concentration of drug, φstart is the inner
diameter prior to giving the first concentration of drug and φ zero Ca is the diameter fully relaxed in
zero calcium PSS. Effective concentrations that produced half maximal dilation (EC50) were
determined from individual plots of concentration-response curves then averaged per group.
