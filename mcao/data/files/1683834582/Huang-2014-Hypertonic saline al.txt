Abstract
Background: Hypertonic saline (HS) has been successfully used clinically for treatment of various forms of cerebral
edema. Up-regulated expression of Na-K-Cl Cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) and inflammatory mediators such as tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) has been demonstrated to be closely associated with
the pathogenesis of cerebral edema resulting from a variety of brain injuries. This study aimed to explore if
alleviation of cerebral edema by 10% HS might be effected through down-regulation of inflammatory mediator
expression in the microglia, and thus result in decreased NKCC1 expression in astrocytes in the cerebral cortex
bordering the ischemic core.
Methods: The Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats that underwent right-sided middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were
used for assessment of NKCC1, TNF-α and IL-1β expression using Western blotting, double immunofluorescence
and real time RT-PCR, and the model also was used for evaluation of brain water content (BWC) and infarct size.
SB203580 and SP600125, specific inhibitors of the p38 and JNK signaling pathways, were used to treat primary
microglia cultures to determine whether the two signaling pathways were required for the inhibition of HS on
microglia expressing and secreting TNF-α and IL-1β using Western blotting, double immunofluorescence and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The effect of TNF-α and IL-1β on NKCC1 expression in primary
astrocyte cultures was determined. In addition, the direct inhibitory effect of HS on NKCC1 expression in primary
astrocytes was also investigated by Western blotting, double immunofluorescence and real time RT-PCR.
Results: BWC and infarct size decreased significantly after 10% HS treatment. TNF-α and IL-1β immunoexpression
in microglia was noticeably decreased. Concomitantly, NKCC1 expression in astrocytes was down-regulated. TNF-α
and IL-1β released from the primary microglia subjected to hypoxic exposure and treatment with 100 mM HS
were decreased. NKCC1 expression in primary astrocytes was concurrently and progressively down-regulated
with decreasing concentration of exogenous TNF-α and IL-1β. Additionally, 100 mM HS directly inhibited NKCC1
up-regulation in astrocytes under hypoxic condition.
Conclusions: The results suggest that 10% HS alleviates cerebral edema through inhibition of the NKCC1
Cotransporter, which is mediated by attenuation of TNF-α and IL-1β stimulation on NKCC1.

Background
Cerebral edema results from various cerebral insults, such
as ischemic stroke [1] and traumatic brain injury [2,3].
Hypertonic saline (HS) has been widely used for the
treatment of patients with traumatic shock, cerebral
edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) resulting
from cerebral infarction, hemorrhage or traumatic brain
injury [4,5]. The various types of edema result from
permeability changes induced by multiple factors affecting
the brain’s cellular barriers [6]. It is well known that HS
removes free water from the intracellular into the extracellular space through osmotic force and reduction of
peripheral vascular resistance [7]. Our previous study
has shown that in addition to its osmotic force, 10%
HS exerts anti-edema effects possibly through downregulation of AQP4 expression in the cerebral cortex astrocytes in the ischemic cerebral edema [8]. This suggests
that ion channel transporters related to water transport
whose expression is localized in astrocytes and other cerebral cell types are potential therapeutic targets in HS
treatment.
The Na-K-Cl cotransport systems, which consist of
two isoforms (NKCC1 and NKCC2), have been shown
to play an important role in ion homeostasis and the
subsequent accumulation of intracellular water [9,10]. The
transcriptional up-regulation of Na-K-Cl Cotransporter 1
(NKCC1) in the blood-brain barrier, choroid plexus and
neuroglial cells contributes to these permeability changes
[6,11]. Ischemia-triggered cytotoxic edema is due to the
entry of sodium into neuroglial cells via electroneutral ion
transporters like NKCC1 [12]. It has been found that
sodium, chloride and other solutes influx intracellularly
caused by up-regulated NKCC1 results in cell swelling
[12-14]. This is why NKCC1 plays an important role in
astrocyte swelling/cerebral edema in ischemia and trauma
[15,16]. Some studies have shown that administration of
the NKCC1 blocker bumetanide can attenuate the cell
swelling and injury, suggesting that sodium and chloride
transport via NKCC1 is involved in ischemia-induced cell
swelling and injury [17,18]. A milder gray and white
matter damage has been found in NKCC1 knockout mice
after focal cerebral ischemia [19]. Therefore, inhibition of
NKCC1 expression could alleviate cerebral edema and
protect neurologic functions effectively.
In addition, a previous study has shown that NKCC1
could be selectively up-regulated by TNF-α and IL-1β [20].
It was suggested that the relationship between NKCC1
and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and
IL-1β, may be one of the key factors of cerebral edema.
Microglia are the innate immune cells residing in the
central nervous system (CNS), and they serve as the brain’s
immune defense. They are readily activated in different
stress stimuli, such as inflammation and hypoxia. Previous
studies have shown that cytokines, such as TNF-α and

Page 2 of 20

IL-1β released from microglia under hypoxic-ischemic
and inflammation conditions [21,22], are closely related to
cerebral edema because they can disrupt the endothelial’s
tight junction [22,23]. Inhibition of microglia activation is
beneficial to cerebral edema. It has been reported that HS
treatment is beneficial as it attenuates inflammation by
suppressing neutrophil activation [24-26] via inhibiting
the P38 MAPK pathway.
Arising from the above, we hypothesized that 10% HS
administration could decrease the production of TNF-α
and IL-1β released by microglia under ischemia-hypoxic
condition. As a corollary, down-regulating the NKCC1
expression in the cerebral cortex astrocytes in the periischemic brain tissue would ameliorate the cerebral edema.
If this were proven to be so, it would be pertinent to
extending the study to investigate the potential underlying
mechanism whereby HS could affect microglial release of
TNF-α and IL-1β.

Methods
Animals and experimental groups

A total of 156 male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 220 to 250 g were randomly divided into a shamoperated group (abbreviated: sham group, n = 52), cerebral
ischemic + normal saline group (abbreviated: ischemic
group, n = 52) and cerebral ischemic + 10% HS treatment
group (abbreviated: 10% HS group, n = 52). The whole
operation process followed the aseptic surgical techniques,
the tail vein was cannulated to facilitate the intravenous (i.v.) infusion of 10% HS or normal saline. Rats in the
ischemic group and 10% HS group were subjected to
right-sided middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),
sham-operated rats were subjected to the surgical procedures except for MCAO.
After operation, rats in the sham group were treated
with a continuous i.v. infusion of normal saline (0.3 ml/h)
via the tail vein until the end of the experiment. At 2 h
following MCAO, rats in the ischemic group and 10% HS
group were treated with a continuous i.v. infusion of
normal saline (0.3 ml/h) and 10% HS, respectively. On the
basis of different treatment times, animals were further
subdivided into two groups: 12 h and 24 h subgroups. The
number of rats killed at various time points in different
groups is shown in Table 1. Animal handling and experiments were approved by Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee, Guangdong Province, China.
Focal brain ischemia animal model and neurological
deficit evaluation

Before surgical procedure, the rats were fasted overnight,
but were allowed free access to water. The rats were
anesthetized with 5% ketamine (40 mg/kg) (FuJian GuTian
Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Ningde, FuJian, China). A heating
lamp was used to maintain the rectal temperature between

37 and 37.5°C throughout the surgical procedures.
Focal brain ischemia was induced using the intraluminal suture MCAO method as described in detail in
our previous study [8]. The rats in the sham-operated
group were subjected to the surgical procedures except
for intravascular filament occlusion. At 2 h after MCAO,
the intraluminal filament was carefully pulled out to
establish reperfusion and the neurologic deficit was
evaluated. The neurologic findings were scored on a
five-point scale based on the Zea-Longa scale [27]: 0,
no observable neurologic deficit; 1, a mild focal neurologic deficit (failing to extend left forepaw fully); 2, a
moderate focal neurologic deficit (circling to the left);
and 3, a severe focal deficit (falling to the left); 4, the
rats did not move or walk spontaneously and had a
depressed level of consciousness. The rats with a neurologic deficit score of 1 to 3 were considered effective
models.
TTC assessment of infarct size

A total of 18 male SD rats were randomly divided into a
sham-operated group (n = 6), a cerebral ischemic + normal
saline group (n = 6) and a cerebral ischemic + 10% HS
treatment group (n = 6). At 24 h after MCAO, the rats
were killed with 5% ketamine anesthesia, the brains were
rapidly removed and frozen at -70°C for three minutes.
After this, 3 mm coronal slices were prepared with a rat
brain matrix (68709; RWD Life Technology Co., Ltd,
Shenzhen, China) starting at the frontal pole. Slices
were incubated with 2% 2,3,5,-triphenyltetrazolium chloride
monohydrate (TTC; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for
30 minutes at 37°C protected from light and flipped
every five minutes for consistent staining of anterior
and posterior faces [15,28]. The sections were then
scanned. The cerebral infarct area in each section was
calculated by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics,
Inc. Rockville, MD, USA). Infarct areas on each section
were summed and multiplied by section thickness to give
the infarction volume.

Assessment of ischemic hemispheric cerebral edema

Under deep anesthesia condition, rats were killed at the
end of the experiment by decapitation (n = 7 per group).
The brains were quickly removed and blotted gently to
remove small quantities of adsorbent moisture. After
this, the brains were dissected into ipsilateral ischemic and
contralateral hemispheres through the interhemispheric
fissure. The ratio of wet to dry weight was used to estimate
cerebral edema [29]. Tissues were immediately weighed
on an electronic balance with a scale to within 0.001 mg.
Dry weight was measured after the ischemic hemispheres were heated for three days at 100°C in a drying
oven. Tissue water content was then calculated as%
H2O = (1 - dry weight/wet weight) × 100% [29].
Mixed glia cell culture

Mixed glia cultures were prepared from a modified
method based on the method of Giulian and Baker [30].
In brief, cerebral hemispheres were separated from 0
to 24 h-old SD pups, the meninges and superficial
vessels were carefully removed. The cerebral cortex
was harvested and digested with 10 ml 0.125% trypsin
containing 600 U DNase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA,
Cat. No. D4527) for 15 minutes in 37°C thermostatic
water bath. After this, 10 ml of Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium-F12 nutrient mixture (DMEM-F12)
(Invitrogen Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA,
USA; Cat. No. 31330-038) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Invitrogen Life Technologies Corporation;
Cat. No. 10099-141) was added. The tissue was then
triturated several times with a 5 ml pipette. The undissociated tissue clumps were allowed to settle for one to
two minutes. Subsequently, the supernatant was collected
and passed through a 70 μm cell strainer to remove the
remaining small clumps of tissue; the cell suspension
was then centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for five minutes.
The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of DMEM-F12 supplemented with
10% FBS. The resuspended cells were seeded into poly-L-

lysine-coated 75 cm2 flasks at a density of 250,000 cells/ml
and cultured at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2/95% air. The
medium was changed after 24 h and then replaced every
three to four days.
Microglia purification and treatment

After 10 to 14 days, the bottom of the flask showed a
confluency of cells with mixed glia, including mainly
astrocytes/microglia/oligodendrocytes. A high purity microglia was harvested by the shaking method of Giulian and
Baker [30]. The flasks were placed in an orbital
shaker at 37°C and shaken at 180 rpm for two hours. The
supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 1,500 rpm
for five minutes. For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA), cells were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated 24-well
plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells per well; for Western
blotting, cells were plated on poly-L-lysine-coated sixwell plates at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per well. After
incubation in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5%
CO2 at 37°C for 24 h, the cells were subjected to different
treatments. About 96% of cells in cultures were identified
to be microglia by staining with Iba-1 antibody (Table 2),
a specific marker of microglia.
To study whether HS would affect microglial release
of inflammatory mediators as well as its underlying
mechanism, microglial cells were treated with (HS group)
or without (Hypoxia group) 100 mM HS for 4 h at
3% oxygen, 5% CO2 and 92% nitrogen at 37°C. To
explore whether HS would affect the P38 and JNK
signaling pathways in microglia, another two groups
of cells were added: SB203580 group and SP600125

group. SB203580 (10 μM, Sigma, Cat. No. S8307) and
SP600125 (10 μM, Sigma, Cat. No. S5567), specific inhibitors of the P38 and JNK signaling pathways, respectively,
were used to compare the effect of HS on microglial release of TNF-α and IL-1β. After different treatments, the
cultured medium was collected and stored at -80°C for
ELISA.
To study the effect of HS on the P38 and JNK signaling
pathways under hypoxic condition, microglia cells were
divided into three groups: control group, HS group,
Hypoxia group. The HS group and Hypoxia group
were further subdivided into four groups according to
different treatment times: 30 minutes, 1, 2 and 4 h subgroups. Subsequently, the protein was extracted from the
microglial cells and stored at -80°C for Western blotting.
In all the experiments, cells were cultured in glucose-free
medium except for the control which was cultured in
DMEM-F12 containing 10% FBS.
Astrocyte purification and treatment

After 10 to 14 days, astrocytes were purified by shaking
[31]. Astrocytes were isolated by trypsinization. For Western
blotting and mRNA extraction, cells were seeded in a sixwell plate at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well and incubated at 95% air and 5% CO2 for 24 h. Following this, the
medium was replaced by glucose free medium + TNF-α
(PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA, Cat. No. 400–14)
(5 ng/ml or 10 ng/ml) or IL-1β (PeproTech, Cat. No.
400-01B) (5 ng/ml or 10 ng/ml) and cultured at 37°C in
humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air for 4 h, and the cells were
extracted for protein or mRNA.

TNF-R and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) antagonists
(TNF-α antagonist III, R-7050, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA; Cat. No. sc-356159 and IL-1R
antagonist, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Cat. No. sc-221747),
respectively, were used to ascertain the role of TNF-α and
IL-1β on NKCC1 expression in astrocytes. Cells were
pre-incubated for 30 minutes with TNF-α antagonist
(2 μM) and IL-1R antagonist (2 μM) followed by
TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and IL-1β (10 ng/ml) treatment.
To ascertain whether HS had a direct effect on
NKCC1 mRNA and protein in astrocytes under hypoxic
condition, astrocytes were cultured in glucose-free medium
and treated with or without HS (100 mM) at 3% oxygen,
and 5% CO2 at 37°C. Bumetanide (0.1 mM, B3023, Sigma),
a specific inhibitor of NKCC1, was used as a negative
control. The three groups were named the hypoxia
group, HS group and bumetanide group, respectively.
Western blotting

Proteins were extracted from the peri-ischemic brain
tissue in each group (n = 6) (Figure 1A), microglia
cells and astrocytes using a total protein extraction
kit (Bei Jing Pu Li Lai Gene Technology Co., Ltd., China)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method [32]
using BCA-100 protein quantitative analyzing kit
(Shanghai Biocolor Bioscience & Technology Co. Ltd.,
Shanghai, China), and then the protein samples were
heated at 95°C for five minutes and separated by
SDS-PAGE. The proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane and then blocked with 5% non-fat
milk for 1 h at room temperature. An overnight incubation
with the primary antibodies followed the manufacturer’s
recommendations. After rinses with Tris-buffered saline
with 0.1% Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with
the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated secondary
antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The primary antibodies for the tissue used were as follows: TNF-α, IL-1β
and NKCC1. The primary antibodies for the cells used
(Table 2) were as follows: P38, Phos-P38, JNK, Phos-JNK
and NKCC1. The secondary antibodies used were as follows: goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:3,500, Cell Signaling
Technology, Cat. No.7074), donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP
(1:5,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Cat. No. sc-2020).
The immunoblots were developed using the enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Bei Jing Pu Li Lai
Gene Technology Co., Ltd., China). The signal intensity was
measured with FluorChem 8900 software (version 4.0.1,
Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA, USA), and
fold change was calculated.
Real time RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from the peri-ischemic brain
tissue (n = 6 per group) (indicated in Figure 1. A with

Page 5 of 20

green line) for detection of NKCC1, TNF-α and IL-1β
mRNA at 12 h after MCAO using Trizol Reagent
(Invitrogen Life Technologies Corporation, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quantity of total RNA
was measured with a UV Spectrophotometer (Biochrom
Ltd., UK). For the reverse transcription, 2 μl of total
RNA was combined with 4 μl of 5 × PrimeScript® Buffer
(PrimeScript® RT Master Mix, TaKaRa Biotechnology
(Dalian) Co., Ltd., China; Cat No: DRR036S). RNase Free
dH2O was added to 20 μl, after which the mixture was
heated at 37°C for 15 minutes, 85°C for 5 s. Quantitative
RT-PCR was carried out on a Light Cycler 480 instrument
using a FastStart DNA Master plus SYBR Green I kit
(Roche Diagnostics, GmbH, Roche Applied Science,
Penzberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The expression of target genes was measured
in triplicate, and was normalized to β-actin as an internal
control. The oligonucleotide primer sequences used
were as follows: NKCC1 (160 bp), Forward: TGATTC
CACTTCCTTTATTGCAG, Reverse: TTAATGAG TTGA
GCTCCGGTGA; TNF-α (134 bp), Forward: CCAACAAG
GAGGAGAAGTTCC, Reverse: CTCTGCTTGGTGGTT
TGCTAC; IL-1β (123 bp), Forward: GGAACCCGT GTC
TTCCTAAAG, Reverse: CTGACTTGGCAGAGGACAA
AG; β-actin (203 bp), Forward: GCCAACACAGTGCT
GTCTG, Reverse: TACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCA. Gene
expression was quantified using a modification of the
2-ΔΔCT method as previously described [33].
For astrocytes, the fold change of NKCC1 was also
measured after treatment with different concentrations
of TNF-α and IL-1β for 4 h. The procedure was carried
out as mentioned above.
Analysis of TNF-α and IL-1β expression by ELISA

After microglia cells were subjected to hypoxia for 4 h,
the cultured medium from each group was collected. The
levels of TNF-α and IL-1β released by microglia were then
measured using TNF-α (IBL, Hamburg, Germany, Cat.
No. JP27194) and IL-1β (IBL, Minneapolis, MN, USA, Cat.
No. 27193) ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Finally, the reaction plates were read within
30 minutes in an enzyme micro-plate reader at 450 nm.
Double immunofluorescence

Double immunofluorescence staining was carried out to
detect TNF-α and IL-1β expression in microglia, and
NKCC1 expression in astrocytes in peri-ischemic brain
tissue. Five rats in each group were deeply anesthetized with
an overdose of 5% ketamine and perfused transcardially
with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (pH 7.4). Coronal frozen sections of the brain
of 5 μm thickness at the level of the optic chiasma were
cut and rinsed in PBS (n = 5 per group). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide

at room temperature. Following rinsing in PBS, they were
mounted with a fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO
Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). Cellular co-localization
was observed in a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP2
AOBS; Leica Microsystems Ltd., Wetzlar, Germany).
After hypoxia for 4 h, purified microglia were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) for 20 minutes,
blocked with 5% normal goat serum for 30 minutes,
and then incubated with a mixture of Iba-1 and TNF-α or
IL-1β overnight. Subsequent antibody detection was
carried out with secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse
IgG-FITC (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat. No.
sc-2010) and Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L)-cy3 (1:200,
earthOX, San Francisco, CA, USA) for 1 h. Finally, the
cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus DP73 Microscope, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Purified astrocytes were treated with TNF-α or IL-1β.
The subsequent procedure was carried out as mentioned
above. The primary antibodies included GFAP and
NKCC1, the secondly antibodies were R-PE-conjugated
AffiniPure F(ab’)2 Fragment Donkey An7-Mouse IgG
(H + L) (1:200, Chicago, IL, USA, Cat. No. SA00008-9)
and chicken anti-goat IgG-FITC (1:200, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Cat. No. sc-2988), or Alexa Fluor® 488
Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) (1:200; Invitrogen Life

and Alexa Fluor® 555 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L)
(1:200; Invitrogen Life Technologies Corporation; Cat.
No. A-21428). Finally, the cells were examined under

a fluorescence microscope (Olympus DP73 Microscope,
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Statistical analysis

All data were evaluated by the SPSS13.0 statistical software
(IBM, Armonk, New York, USA). Different statistical
methods were applied according to different types of data.
The distribution values were expressed as mean ± SD.
Three-group two-factor measurement data were analyzed by two-way classification ANOVA. Three-group
univariate-factor measurement data were analyzed by
one-way ANOVA if the data were homogeneity of variance;
otherwise, they were analyzed by Welch ANOVA. Multiple
comparisons were analyzed by the least significant
difference (LSD) method if the data were homogeneity
of variance; otherwise they were analyzed by Dunnett’s T3
method. The criterion for statistical significance was set
at P <0.05.

Results
Neurologic deficit score

Compared with the sham-operated group, the Zea-Longa
scores in the ischemic group and the 10% HS group at the
beginning of reperfusion increased significantly as analyzed by the LSD method (Figure 2A) (*P <0.05). However,
there was no difference in the Zea-Longa scores before
intervention between the ischemic group and the 10% HS
group (Figure 2A) (P = 0.997).
Ipsilateral ischemic hemispheric brain water content
(BWC) and infarct size

BWC in the ipsilateral ischemic hemispheres was significantly different among the sham group, the ischemic
group and the 10% HS group (F = 56.620, P <0.05). There
was no interaction between treatment time and treatment
factors (F = 1.079, P = 0.351). Differences in treatment
factors among different groups did not change over time.
The separate effects of treatment factors were further
analyzed. When compared with that in the sham group,
BWC in the ischemic cerebral hemispheres increased
significantly in the ischemic group and 10% HS group at

Figure 2 The effect of 10% HS on BWC and infarct size. Bar graph A shows that the neurological score shows no difference between the
ischemia group and the 10% HS group (ns: P >0.05, n = 7 per group). Bar graph B shows that the percentage of BWC is significantly increased in
the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere at 12 h and 24 h following MCAO when compared with corresponding controls (sham-operated) (# P <0.05).
However, it is significantly decreased in the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere in 10% HS groups as compared with corresponding ischemic group
(* P <0.05, n = 7 per group). TTC staining images (C-E) shown are from three representative experiments. The white area represents the
infarct brain, and the red area represents the normal brain. Bar graph F shows the infarct volume is significantly decreased in 10% HS
group when compared with ischemia group (* P <0.05, n = 6 per group). Note 10% HS could reduce infarct size effectively. Scale bars:
(C-E), 1 mm per compartment. BWC, brain water content; HS, hypertonic saline; MCAO, middle cerebral artery occlusion; TTC, 2, 3,
5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride.

12 h and 24 h analyzed by the LSD method (Figure 2B)
(#P <0.05). Compared with the ischemic group, BWC in
the ischemic cerebral hemisphere decreased significantly
in the 10% HS group at 12 h and 24 h. This showed that
treatment of ischemic rats with 10% HS alleviated the ipsilateral ischemia-induced increase in BWC at 12 and 24 h
after MCAO (Figure 2B) (*P <0.05).
TTC staining images showed that the infarct size in the
10% HS group (Figure 2E) was smaller than that in the ischemic group (Figure 2D). Cerebral infarct volume was
significantly decreased in the 10% HS group in comparison to the cerebral ischemic group (Figure 2F) (*P <0.05).

The data demonstrated that 10% HS administration exerts
a neuroprotective effect on cerebral ischemia.
NKCC1 mRNA and protein expression in the peri-ischemic
brain tissue

NKCC1 mRNA expression was significantly increased
in the peri-ischemic brain tissue at 12 h following
MCAO rats in comparison with the sham-operated
rats (Figure 1B) (#P <0.05). However, after treatment with
10% HS, NKCC1 mRNA expression in the peri-ischemic
brain tissue was significantly decreased when compared
with the matching ischemic rats (Figure 1B) (*P <0.05).

The immune-reactive bands of NKCC1 protein levels
that appeared at approximately 170 kDa increased significantly in optical density at 12 h following MCAO were
compared with the sham-operated group (Figure 1C-D)
(#P <0.05). However, after treatment with 10% HS,
the optical density was decreased significantly when
compared with the matching ischemic rats (Figure 1C,D)
(*P <0.05).
Intense NKCC1 immunoreactivity was detected in the
astrocytes in the peri-ischemic brain tissue at 24 h following MCAO (Figure 1H-J) when compared with the controls (Figure 1E-G). On the other hand, after treatment
with 10% HS, NKCC1 immunoreactivity in the astrocytes
in the peri-ischemic brain tissue (Figure 1K-M) was
markedly decreased when compared with the matching ischemic rats.
TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA and protein expression in
peri-ischemic brain tissue

Both TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA expression was significantly
increased (Figure 3A-B) (#P <0.05) in ischemic group as
compared with sham group at 12 h, but declined after treatment with 10% HS in the 10% HS group (Figure 3A,B)
(*P <0.05). TNF-α and IL-1β protein expression was increased significantly (Figure 3C-F) (#P <0.05) at 12 h following MCAO in comparison with the sham group, but
after treatment with 10% HS, both TNF-α and IL-1β expression were markedly decreased as compared with ischemic group (Figure 3C-F) (*P <0.05).
Cellular localization and expression of TNF-α and IL-1β in
the peri-ischemic brain tissue

In the sham group (Figure 4A-C, Figure 4J-L), only
moderate TNF-α and IL-1β expression was detected in
some small cells with multiple branched processes and
confirmed to be the microglia by double immunofluorescence with OX42. Confocal images showed that TNFα and IL-1β immunoreactivity was significantly increased (Figure 4D-F, Figure 4M-O) in ischemic group
at 12 h after MCAO when compared with sham group
(Figure 4A-C, Figure 4J-L). However, TNF-α and IL-1β
expression was markedly reduced in HS group following
treatment of 10% HS (Figure 4G-I, Figure 4P-R).
TNF-α and IL-1β protein expression in primary activated
microglia under hypoxic condition

At 4 h after hypoxia, TNF-α and IL-1β immunoexpression
in primary microglia in hypoxia group was markedly enhanced (Figure 5D-F, Figure 5M-O) compared with that in
the control group (Figure 5A-C, Figure 5J-L). On the
other hand, in the HS group (Figure 5G-I, Figure 5P-R),
TNF-α and IL-1β immunoexpression was evidently decreased. In addition, when compared with that in the hypoxia group, more rounded microglia were observed in the

Page 9 of 20

hypoxia group (Figure 5D-F, Figure 5M-O) than that in
the HS group (Figure 5G-I, Figure 5P-R).
The levels of TNF-α and IL-1β in cultured medium
were also measured by ELISA. The results showed that
TNF-α and IL-1β release from microglia was significantly elevated (Figure 6A,B) (#P <0.05) after hypoxia as
compared with that in the control group. However, the
levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were significantly decreased
(Figure 6A,B) (*P <0.05, ** P <0.01) after treatment with
100 mM HS.
The role of MAP kinase signaling pathway in microglial
release of TNF-α and IL-1β

ELISA showed a significant increase in TNF-α and IL-1β
levels at 4 h after hypoxia when compared with the control
group (Figure 6A,B) (#P <0.05), but the levels were markedly decreased after SB203580 (a specific P38 MAPK
inhibitor) or SP600125 (a specific JNK inhibitor) treatment as compared with the hypoxia group (Figure 6A,B)
(*P <0.05, **P <0.01). The same effect was observed after
100 mM HS treatment, indicating that P38 and JNK may
be involved in inflammatory mediators released by microglia. Therefore Western blot was performed to examine
whether HS could directly affect the MAPK and JNK signaling pathway in microglia. The results showed that both
phos-MAPK and phos-JNK protein expression levels were
significantly down-regulated following HS treatment at
30 minutes, 1 h, 2 h and 4 h under hypoxic conditions
when compared with the hypoxia group (Figure 6C-E)
(*P <0.05).
NKCC1 mRNA and protein expression in primary
astrocytes after treatment with TNF-α, IL-1β and TNF-R
and IL-1R antagonists

To ascertain whether the TNF-α and IL-1β played a role
in NKCC1 mRNA and protein expression, astrocytes
were treated with glucose-free medium containing different doses of TNF-α (10 ng/ml or 5 ng/ml) or IL-1β
(10 ng/ml or 5 ng/ml), TNF-R (2 μM) and IL-1R antagonists (2 μM). It was found that both TNF-α and IL-1β
could significantly elevate (Figure 7A-C) (#P <0.05) the
expression of NKCC1 mRNA and protein when compared with the control group and glucose-free medium
group. This effect appeared to be dose-dependent; thus,
the higher the concentration of TNF-α or IL-1β, the
greater the expression of NKCC1 mRNA and protein
(Figure 7A-C) (*P <0.05, **P <0.01). More strikingly,
NKCC1 was drastically decreased in astrocytes when the
cells were pre-incubated with TNF-R and IL-1R antagonist (Figure 8A-D) (*P <0.05, ** P <0.01).
Double immunofluorescence showed that more intense
NKCC1 immunoreactivity was detected in primary astrocytes after treatment with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) (Figure 7G-I)
and IL-1β (10 ng/ml) (Figure 7J-L), when compared

sham-operated group (#P <0.05, n = 6 per group); however, the optical density of TNF-α and IL-1β in the ischemic 12-h + 10% HS group is
significantly decreased after 10% HS treatment (*P <0.05, n = 6 per group). IL-1β, interleukin-1 beta; HS, hypertonic saline; MCAO, middle cerebral

with the control group (Figure 7D-F) and the glucose-free
medium group (Figure 7M-O). However, both TNF-R
and IL-1R antagonists could significantly revert the
NKCC1 immunoreactivity in astrocytes (Figure 9G-I,
M-O) treated with TNF-α (Figure 9D-F) or IL-1β
(Figure 9J-L).
NKCC1 mRNA and protein in astrocytes under hypoxic
conditions

The results showed that at 4 h after hypoxia, NKCC1
mRNA (Figure 10A) and protein (Figure 10B,C) expression
was significantly increased in hypoxia group as compared
with the control group (#P <0.05). However, following

treatment with 100 mM HS or 0.1 mM bumetanide,
NKCC1 mRNA (Figure 10A) and protein (Figure 10B,C)
expression was drastically decreased in comparison with
the hypoxia group (*P <0.05).
In parallel with mRNA and protein expression, the immunoreactivity of NKCC1 was significantly increased in primary astrocytes following hypoxic exposure (Figure 10G-I),
whereas this was weak and moderate in the control
group (Figure 10D-F). However, either 100 mM HS or
0.1 mM bumetanide pretreatment, NKCC1 immunoreactivity of HS group (Figure 10J-L) and bumetanide group
(Figure 10M-O) was noticeably attenuated as compared
with the hypoxia group.

Discussion
Osmotherapy agents, such as hypertonic saline and mannitol, are currently being used for treatment of cerebral
edema and elevated ICP resulting from ischemic stroke

[1]. Hypertonic saline has recently received considerable
attention as an alternative to mannitol because it is more
effective in ameliorating cerebral edema than an equal volume of 20% mannitol [34]. The present study has shown

that ipsilateral ischemic hemispheric BWC increased significantly following right-sided MCAO for 12 h, suggesting an acute and early onset of cerebral edema after
ischemic insults. After treatment with 10% HS for 12 and

24 h, BWC of the ipsilateral ischemic hemisphere decreased significantly. This suggests that 10% HS can alleviate cerebral edema effectively. Our results are consistent
with previous studies [7].

Inappropriate activation and increased expression of
NKCC1 will contribute to cell swelling and tissue edema.
Endothelial NKCC1 was also activated after ischemia
and this process was associated with astrocyte swelling/
cerebral edema [28,35]. The astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema were effectively reduced by bumetanide, a specific inhibitor of NKCC1 [36,37]. Our results have shown
an up-regulation of the mRNA and protein expression of
NKCC1 in the peri-ischemic brain tissue. Double immunofluorescence staining has further demonstrated that
NKCC1 expression was localized in the cerebral cortex

astrocytes as verified by its co-localization with GFAP, a
specific cellular marker for astrocytes. More importantly,
it has also been found that 10% HS treatment alleviated
the NKCC1 expression in the cerebral cortex astrocytes
with the reduction of BWC. In light of the above, it is suggested that besides its osmotic force, osmotherapy with
10% HS can attenuate cerebral edema probably through
down-regulation of NKCC1 expression in the cerebral
cortex astrocytes. Remarkably, the infarct size in the periischemic brain tissue was drastically reduced following
10% HS treatment. These results indicated that 10%

HS administration can alleviate ischemic brain damage with the reduction of cerebral edema and, hence, it is
neuroprotective.
Microglia is extremely sensitive to hypoxic-ischemia
[38], and it is well documented that microglial activation
is a hallmark feature in different cerebral diseases. Under
ischemic-hypoxic conditions, a variety of inflammatory
cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-1β [21], are released by
activated microglia. These inflammatory cytokines have
been reported to interrupt the blood brain barrier (BBB)
by destroying the endothelial tight junctions, thus leading
to cerebral edema [23]. In addition, reactive alterations

in morphology, changing from ramified into “ameboid”
phenotype [39], was observed and this is indicative of
microglial activation. Previous studies have shown that reduced TNF-α and IL-1β caused a marked reduction in ischemic brain damage and cerebral edema [40,41]. This
suggests that inhibition or suppression of microglial activation and release of TNF-α and IL-1β might ameliorate
BBB disruption and cerebral edema. The present results
demonstrated that TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased at 12 h following
MCAO. By RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and double
immunofluorescence study, it was demonstrated that 10%

Figure 10 HS may directly down-regulate NKCC1 mRNA and protein expression in primary astrocytes under hypoxic condition.

HS could reduce the levels of TNF-α and IL-1β expression
by microglia. In vitro results were consistent with in vivo
experiments. Thus, at 4 h after hypoxia, not only the
microglial morphology was altered from resting into an
activated state, but the release of TNF-α and IL-1β in the
culture medium from the primary microglia was also increased. However, the production of TNF-α and IL-1β
was markedly reduced after treatment with 100 mM HS.
These results suggest that HS can exert an inhibitory effect on microglia in its release of TNF-α and IL-1β. The
question arising from this would be what is the underlying
mechanism regulating the inhibitory effect on inflammation of HS.
It is well documented that the P38 and JNK signaling
pathways are closely related to cytokine production. We
therefore used SB203580 and SP600125, specific inhibitors of JNK and p38, respectively, to explore whether
P38 and JNK signaling pathways would be involved in
TNF-α and IL-1β production in primary microglia. The
present results have demonstrated that both SB203580
and SP600125 could cause a marked reduction of TNFα and IL-1β release by microglia, supporting that P38
and JNK are involved in the production of TNF-α and
IL-1β. Because the inhibitory effect is in concert with
that of HS, and hypertonicity may have an effect of inhibition on P38 which have been shown in previous studies
[25,42], we next investigated whether HS had an effect on
phosphorylated P38 and JNK expression in microglia.
Remarkably, phosphorylated P38 and JNK levels were
significantly up-regulated after hypoxia for 4 h, and were
significantly down-regulated after HS treatment. Taken together, it is concluded that activated microglia release high
levels of TNF-α and IL-1β via P38 and JNK signaling pathways under hypoxic condition, but most strikingly HS
could interrupt this process by inhibiting phosphorylation
of P38 and JNK proteins.
It has been reported by others that hypertonicity could
activate P38 and JNK signaling pathways in neutrophils
[26,43], but it was also pointed out that HS could not
activate P38 at the Na+ at concentration < 200 mM.
For the JNK signaling pathway, the concentration of
HS that activated the JNK signaling pathway was more
than 400 mM [24]. In this study, the concentration of
HS used was 100 mM in vitro. Even if we were to consider the additional Na+ in DMEM, the concentration
of HS would be approximately 200 mM. Therefore,
HS inhibition of the P38 and JNK signaling pathways
as demonstrated in the present results may be through
intercepting signaling pathways upstream [24,25,42]. The
other consideration is that a low concentration of HS can
only weakly activate P38 but it can prevent a strong activation by other stimuli, such as hypoxia. Further studies
are necessary to clarify the mechanism underlying this
phenomenon.

Page 18 of 20

The next issue to be resolved would be the relationship among TNF-α and IL-1β and NKCC1. It has been
reported that NKCC1 expression in microvascular endothelial cells from rats and human umbilical vein endothelial cells is selectively up-regulated by TNF-α and
IL-1β [20]. In vitro, the present results show that
NKCC1 mRNA and protein expression in primary astrocytes was significantly augmented when incubated with
TNF-α or IL-1β, but was down-regulated with declining
concentration of TNF-α or IL-1β. Furthermore, TNF-R
and IL-1R antagonist could revert the increased expression of NKCC1 induced by TNF-α and IL-1β. These
results suggest that TNF-α and IL-1β may directly upregulate NKCC1 expression. Therefore, NKCC1 downregulation after MCAO following HS treatment may
partially be attributed to decreased TNF-α and IL-1β
production.
We also investigated whether HS had a direct inhibitory effect on NKCC1 expression in primary astrocytes.
The results have shown that NKCC1 mRNA and protein
expression levels were lower in the HS group as compared with the hypoxia group, suggesting that HS could
directly inhibit NKCC1 expression in astrocytes. This result appears to contradict the finding that hyperosmotic
could activate NKCC1 [44]. A possible explanation for
this discrepancy would be a differential response to HS
between different cell types. The other possible explanation may be that HS decreases viability of astrocytes and
protein content because of its excessive osmotic pressure
(200 mOsm (100 mM HS) + 310 mOsm (glucose-free
medium)). In view of this, the blood osmotic pressure and
Na+ concentration in clinical application of HS should be
considered.
Taken together, 10% HS treatment ameliorates ischemic cerebral edema through reducing the production of
TNF-α and IL-1β released by microglia. This would result in reduced NKCC1 expression in astrocytes. It is
also noteworthy that HS may also directly down-regulate
NKCC1 expression in astrocytes.

Conclusion
We show here that 10% HS ameliorated ischemic cerebral edema and infarct size in the peri-ischemic brain
tissue. Concomitantly, 10% HS down-regulated increased
NKCC1 expression in the cerebral cortex astrocytes as
well as TNF-α and IL-1β released by activated microglia.
The relation between NKCC1 expression and TNF-α
and IL-1β was unequivocally demonstrated in vitro using
TNF-R and IL-1R antagonists. Furthermore, HS decreased TNF-α and IL-1β released by microglia by inhibiting the activation of P38 and JNK signaling pathway,
thus reducing the stimulation on NKCC1. These results
demonstrated that in addition to its osmotic force, 10%
HS exerts anti-edema effects possibly through down-

regulation of NKCC1 expression in the cerebral cortex
astrocytes in the ischemic cerebral edema. A total of
10% HS administration may be neuroprotective in view
of its exertive effect in reducing the cerebral edema. This
study leaves us with a new concept as to the mechanism
of 10% HS treatment, that is, aside from setting up an
osmotic gradient, HS ameliorates ischemic cerebral
edema not merely by down-regulating aquaporin AQP4
expression but also that of NKCC1. This would provide
a better theoretical basis for clinical use of HS.
