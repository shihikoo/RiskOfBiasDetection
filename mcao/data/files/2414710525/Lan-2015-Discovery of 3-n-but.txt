It has been reported that the ischemic stroke resulting from occlusion of arteries in the
brain accounts for more than 80% of all strokes and is considered as one of the major
causes of death and adult neurological disability in many countries.1,2 At present, the
mortality of stroke patients is still increasing each year.3 Several evidences show that
the platelet aggregation-related thrombosis is a key step in the pathophysiology of
acute ischemic strokes.4,5 Therefore, the development of new drugs with antiplatelet
aggregation and antithrombotic activities will be of great significance to the treatment
of ischemic strokes. Many remarkable advances in the study of the mechanisms of
ischemic brain injury have been made, and there are many pharmacological approaches
to protect from injury caused by ischemic strokes.6–8 Unfortunately, some drugs are
not ideal anti-ischemic agents because of unsatisfactory efficacy; only intravenous (iv)
administration of the serine protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) has been
proven to be effective, and t-PA is the only drug approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of acute ischemic strokes clinically. What is worse,
about 90% of all stroke patients are excluded from t-PA treatment due to numerous
contraindications and its extremely narrow therapeutic window.9,10
Previous studies have demonstrated that mechanisms leading to the development of ischemic damage include apoptosis, calcium ion [Ca2+] overload, necrosis,

Abstract: To develop novel anti-ischemic stroke agents with better therapeutic efficacy and
bioavailability, we designed and synthesized a series of 3-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-1-ones
compounds (3a–i) derivatives, one of which (3d) exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity for
the adenosine diphosphate-induced and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation. This
activity is superior to that of 3-n-butylphthalide and comparable with aspirin and edaravone.
Meanwhile, 3d not only exhibited a potent activity in scavenging free radicals and improving
the survival of HT22 cells against the reactive oxygen species-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro but
also significantly attenuated the ischemia/reperfusion-induced oxidative stress in ischemic rat
brains. Results from transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and permanent middle cerebral
artery occlusion model, indicated that 3d could significantly reduce infarct size, improve neurobehavioral deficits, and prominently decrease attenuation of cerebral damage. Most importantly,
3d possessed a very high absolute bioavailability and was rapidly distributed in brain tissue to
keep high plasma drug concentration for the treatment of ischemic strokes. In conclusion, our
findings suggest that 3-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-1-ones, a novel series of compounds,
might be candidate drugs for the treatment of acute ischemic strokes, and 3d may be a promising
therapeutic agent for the primary and secondary prevention of ischemic stroke.
Keywords: stroke, platelet aggregation, ischemia/reperfusion, middle cerebral artery occlusion,

inflammation, immune modulation, and oxidative stress;10–13
specially oxidative stress because formation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) plays an important role in neuronal
damage during cerebral ischemia. Overwhelming evidence
shows a transient reduction of brain artery blood flow often
initiates a large amount of free radicals after ischemia/
reperfusion (I/R) injury, such as O2−, HO2, H2O2, and OH,
which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of I/R injury
because free radicals induce lipid peroxidation, protein
oxidation, and DNA damage.14,15 Many methods have been
adopted to reduce oxidative stress through formation of ROS
and to block the ROS-mediated neuronal injury.16,17 Hence
it will be particularly important for us to find novel agents
with high activity in scavenging free radicals.
The 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) is a new drug for treatment
of ischemic strokes clinically, which was approved by the
State Food and Drug Administration in People’s Republic of
China at the end of 2002. Many clinical studies have proven
that NBP is a potentially beneficial drug for treatment of
ischemic strokes. It can inhibit platelet aggregation, reduce
ischemia-induced oxidative damage, regulate energy metabolism, improve microcirculation, and reduce brain infarct
size.6,18–20 However, the efficacy of NBP is limited because of
its high hydrophobicity and low bioavailability,21–25 and thus
its clinical use for patients suffering serious ischemic strokes
is restricted. In addition, to improve its efficacy, it has to be
simultaneously administered with antiplatelet and antioxidant
drugs.26 Hence, the development of new anti-ischemic stroke
drugs suitable for iv injection with remarkable antiplatelet
aggregation and antioxidant activities for acute ischemic
stroke treatment will be of great significance.
Previous studies have suggested that a class of compounds, isoindoline derivatives, exhibit a good activity in
treating the central nervous systemic disease.27–34 Because
the structure of isoindoline derivatives is very similar to that
of NBP and its amide bond is more stable than ester bond
of NBP in the gastrointestinal tract, 3-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-1Hisoindol-1-ones may exhibit better anti-ischemic stroke activity than NBP. Therefore, we designed and synthesized a novel
class of compounds 3-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-1-ones
by replacing the oxygen atom at the 2-position of phthalide
with nitrogen and introducing various lengths of straight/
branch chain alkyl into 3-position of phthalide. The resulting compound 3d (Figure 1) displayed potent antiplatelet
aggregation, antioxidation activity, and anti-ischemic stroke
activity, which was comparable with NBP and edaravone
(Eda). More importantly, 3d displayed higher bioavailability
than NBP, which will be beneficial to the clinical treatment
of acute ischemic strokes.

Materials and methods
Chemistry
H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 13C NMR spectral data were obtained from a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz
spectrometer at 300 K using Tetramethylsilane as an internal
standard. MS spectra were recorded on an Agi1lent 6120
mass spectrometer. The purities of the compounds were
characterized by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis (L-2000 HPLC system consisting of 5110
pumps and 5430 diode array detector). The target compounds
3a–i with a purity of .95% were used for subsequent
experiments.
Sprague Dawley rats (250–260 g, 350–400 g) and
Kunming (KM) mice (18–22 g) were supplied by the
Laboratory Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University
(Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China). All experimental
protocols were approved and supervised by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-sen University
(Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China).

Preparation of 3a–i
A Grignard reagent (3 mmol) was added to an ice bath-chilled
solution of phthalimide (1 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (10 mL) under
nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at the
same temperature for 3 hours. Subsequently the reaction was
quenched by a saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl (6 mL).
The resulting mixture was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3×10 mL),
and the combined organic phases were washed with brine, then
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. The

crude mixture was purified by a short silica gel column filtration
(EtOAc-petroleum ether =2:1 v/v) to obtain 2a–i. Triethylsilane (10.0 mmol) and trifluoroboron etherate (3.0 mmol) were
added successively to a solution of 3a–i in dry CH2Cl2 (10 mL)
at −15°C under nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred
at room temperature overnight. A saturated aqueous solution of
NaHCO3 (3 mL) was added and followed by CH2Cl2 extraction
(3×6 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with
brine and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered,
and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue
was purified by column chromatography (EtOAc-petroleum
ether =2:1 v/v) to give the title compounds.

Effect against platelet aggregation in vitro
Blood was collected from the Sprague Dawley rat abdominal
aorta (350–400 g, n=60) and mixed with 3.8% sodium citrate
(9:1, v/v). Then platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was separated
by centrifugation at 110× g for 7 minutes at 25°C, and the
residue was further centrifuged at 960× g for 20 minutes to
collect platelet-poor plasma. We then measured the effects
of individual compounds against platelet aggregation using
Born’s method35 in vitro using a two-channel aggregometer

(Chrono-log 700) within 2 hours. Briefly, rat PRP samples
(250 µL) were preincubated in triplicate with vehicle
di­methyl sulfoxide (DMSO), with the individual compounds
(2.5 µL) and positive control drugs (aspirin [ASP], NBP,
and Eda) at the same concentrations (1.02, 1.28, 1.60, 2.00,
and 2.50 mM) for 5 minutes at 37°C, and then adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) (10 µM; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO,
USA) or arachidonic acid (AA) (0.8 mM; Sigma-Aldrich)
induced platelet aggregation in individual PRP samples, followed by recording the maximal platelet aggregation within
5 minutes. The inhibition rate of individual drugs on platelet
aggregation was determined according to the following
formula: inhibition rate (%) =100% − the maximal platelet
aggregation of compounds ×100%/the maximal platelet
aggregation of DMSO (the same rat PRP), and then a dose
achieving 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation (IC50) of
individual compounds was calculated.

(50% propanediol), 3) 3d (20 mg/kg) group, 4) 3d (50 mg/kg)
group, 5) NBP (50 mg/kg) group, 6) Eda (3.0 mg/kg) group,
7) ASP (50 mg/kg) group. Groups 3−7 were treated by gavage
with the indicated dose of the compound in 50% propanediol
daily for 2 consecutive days. Subsequently, the rats were
injected by hypodermic injection of 0.2% carrageenan, as
described previously.36 The black tail occurrence and black
tail length of mice were, respectively, detected at 24 and
48 hours after carrageenan injection.

Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
Male Sprague Dawley rats (250−260 g) were randomly
divided into seven groups (n=6 per group): 1) sham-operation
group, 2) middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model
group (oil), 3) I/R + 3d (10 mg/kg) group, 4) I/R + 3d
(20 mg/kg) group, 5) I/R + 3d (50 mg/kg) group, 6) I/R +
NBP (20 mg/kg) group, and 7) I/R + Eda (3.0 mg/kg) group.
Then rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal (ip) injection
of 10% chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, ip) and underwent an
MCAO surgery, as described previously, with few modifications. In brief, after a midline neck skin incision was made,
the right common carotid artery, internal carotid artery (ICA),
and external carotid artery of individual rats were surgically exposed free from surrounding tissue and nerves, and
a 4-0 monofilament nylon suture (Beijing Sunbio Biotech,
Beijing, People’s Republic of China), with its tips coated

with poly-l-lysine, was introduced into the ICA through a
small incision on the stump of the common carotid artery
to occlude the origin of the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
The suture was inserted into the ICA for 20–22 mm until
a light obstruction was felt. After 2 hours of occlusion of
MCA, reperfusion was restored with the suture withdrawn,
and the warm light was used to maintain the rat’s core body
temperature at 37°C±0.5°C during the surgical procedure.

Permanent middle cerebral artery
occlusion
Male Sprague Dawley rats (250−260 g) were obtained from
the Laboratory Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University
(Guangzhou, People’s Republic of China) and were housed
for at least 1 week in the holding area before the start of
experiments. Rats were randomly divided into five groups
(n=9 per group): 1) sham-operation group, 2) permanent
MCAO (pMCAO) model group (50% propanediol), 3) 3d
(50 mg/kg) group, 4) NBP (50 mg/kg) group, and 5) Eda
(3.0 mg/kg) group. The rest of the procedure was the same
as transient MCAO (tMCAO) except that reperfusion was
not restored.

Neurobehavioral testing
After MCAO surgery, neurological function of individual
rats was assessed at 24 hours of reperfusion. The neurological deficits were graded on a 5-point scale by Longa’s
method37 in a blinded manner: 0, no neurological deficit;
1, failure to extend the forepaw on lifting the animal by the tail;
2, circling to the left side; 3, falling to the contralateral side;
and 4, inability to walk and absence of spontaneous activity.

Measurement of infarct size
At 24 hours of reperfusion, the animals were anesthetized
with 10% chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, ip) and killed, and
their brains were then rapidly removed and sliced into five
2 mm thick slices. The brain sections were immediately
immersed in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (SigmaAldrich) for 30 minutes at 37°C, followed by fixing in 4%
paraformaldehyde. The infarct area was white, whereas the
live brain tissue was red. The white areas and the total area in
individual sections were measured and analyzed using ImagePro Plus, and infarct size was expressed as the ratio of the
volume of the white area over that of the total brain area.

Histopathological assessment
At 24 hours postreperfusion, the rats (n=3 per group) were
anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, ip),

followed by perfusion with 70 mL 4% paraformaldehyde, and
100 mL normal saline until the liver was white. The infarcted
tissue was separated and immersed into 4% paraformaldehyde, then the brain tissues were embedded in paraffin for
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain at 5 µm, and the cerebral
cortex area was examined by a light microscope.

The activity of radical scavenging assay
in vitro
The free radical scavenging activities of 3d, NBP, and Eda
were determined against H2O2 against HT22 cells, which
were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% new-born
calf serum (Life Technologies, Gibco, USA) at 37°C in a 5%
CO2 atmosphere. Murine HT22 cells (20,000 cells/well) were
cultured in 96-well plates for 24 hours during the exponential phase of growth. After that, the cells were cultured in
quadruplicate with different concentrations (10−100 µM) of
3d, NBP, and Eda for 2 hours and were exposed to 500 µM
H2O2 for 1 hour, which was then replaced with fresh medium.
Finally, the cells were incubated for 12 hours, and cell
viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.

Evaluation of antioxidant stress activity
in vivo
At 24 hours postreperfusion, all rats (n=10 per group) were
anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate (300 mg/kg, ip) and
immediately sacrificed. The total brain of each rat was rapidly removed, rinsed with 0.9% cold saline and frozen for 10
minutes in a refrigerator at −4°C, and then the ischemic core
and ischemic penumbra were separated according to previous
reports and stored at −70°C.38 After protein concentrations
of individual brain samples were quantified, glutathione
peroxidase (GSH-Px), total superoxide dismutase (SOD),
and nitric oxide (NO) activities and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in brain tissue were determined using
analysis kits (Jiancheng Institute of Biotechnology, Nanjing,
People’s Republic of China) based on the manufacturer’s
instruction.

Study on pharmacokinetics and
biodistribution
Wistar rats (250−260 g) with half males and half females
(1:1; male:female) were obtained from the Laboratory
Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou,
People’s Republic of China) and divided into two groups

After administration, 0.5 mL blood samples were collected
in centrifuge tubes containing heparin at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30,
45, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 360, 480, and 600 minutes and
then centrifuged at 2,650× g for 10 minutes. 3d concentration was measured by liquid–liquid extraction; the addition
of 50 µL internal standard n-butylbenzoic acid and 50 µL
40% acetonitrile to 100 µL plasma sample with 800 µL ethyl
acetate and dichloromethane (v/v=4:1), and then 500 µL of
supernatant was dried at 40°C under a stream of nitrogen
gas after vortexed for 5 minutes. The residue was reconstituted into 200 µL 40% acetonitrile. After centrifuging at
13,000×  g for 10 minutes, the supernatants (10 µL) were
used for HPLC analysis (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Pharmacokinetic parameters of 10 mg/kg iv administration and
10 mg/kg po administration were calculated according to the
compartment model using the WinNonlin software. The po

The KM mice (18–22 g) were divided into three groups
randomly (n=6 per group), and individual mice were treated
with an iv dose (10 mg/kg) of compound 3d. Each group of
mice was sacrificed at 15, 45, and 90 minutes, respectively,
after iv injection. Then, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney,
and brain tissue were collected, rinsed in cold saline, and
weighed. All tissue samples were homogenized in saline in

Results and discussion
Chemistry
Our method for the synthesis of target compounds 3a–i,
a flexible approach to 3-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-1ones via the reductive-alkylation procedure,39 is displayed
in Figure 2. An ice-bath chilled solution of phthalimide
(10 mmol) in CH2Cl2 was subjected to a reaction with the
Grignard reagents for 3 hours under ice-bath temperature to
generate hydroxyl compounds 2a–i, which had a high yield
of 97%. These compounds were converted to 3a–i which
resulted in a 45%−69% yield via the reductive-alkylation
procedure by reaction with triethylsilane and trifluoroboron
etherate at −15°C under N2 atmosphere. The crude product
was subjected to column chromatography purification on
silica gel to get the pure target products, followed by MS,
1
H NMR, 13C NMR, and HPLC to identify their structures.
Compounds 3a–i in a purity of .95% were used for subsequent experiments.

Discovery of isoindoline as anti-ischemic stroke agent

of antiplatelet activity of NBP and 3-n-butyl-2,3-dihydro1H-isoindol-1-one. The probable mechanism was not only
related to AA-thromboxane A2 cascade but also involving
NO-cyclic guanosine monophosphate signal path. Furthermore, NBP acted as an antiplatelet agent by disturbing the
metabolic process of AA and improving cyclic adenosine
monophosphate level.40–42
The antiplatelet aggregation activities of individual
compounds in vitro were evaluated in rat PRP using Born’s
turbidimetric method. The 10 μM ADP and 0.8 mM AA were
used to induce platelet aggregation. ASP and Eda are inhibitor
of AA-induced platelet aggregation and a free radical scavenger, respectively. There were five different concentrations of
target compounds to be determined for calculating IC50.
As shown in Table 1, for the ADP-induced platelet
aggregation, five compounds displayed significant inhibitory activities. The inhibitory effects of 3d, 3e, 3f, 3h, and
3i (IC50 of 1.38, 1.48, 1.43, 1.53, and 1.52 mM, respectively)
were stronger than those of Eda (IC50=1.76 mM), ASP
(IC50=1.58 mM), and NBP (IC50.1.79 mM). Compounds
3d and 3f (IC50 of 1.01 and 0.96 mM, respectively) inhibited AA-induced platelet aggregation more effectively
than NBP (IC50= 1.10 mM) and less effectively than Eda
(IC50=0.85 mM) and ASP (IC50=0.81 mM). In particular,
as shown in Figure 3, the inhibitory effect of 1.28 mM 3d
(71.69%) on the ADP-induced platelet aggregation was 1.71-,
2.22-, and 2.34-fold stronger than that of NBP (41.93%),
ASP (32.25%), and Eda (30.64%), whereas its inhibition on
the AA-induced platelet activation (83.33%) was 1.10- and

1.31-fold more potent than that of NBP (75.86%) and Eda
(63.49%), comparable with that of ASP (95.43%). These
data revealed that compounds with straight-chain alkyl had
stronger inhibitory platelet aggregation activity than those
with branch-chain alkyl. The results indicated that 3d had a
potent antiplatelet aggregation activity in both the ADP- and
AA-induced platelet aggregation. Thus, 3d was used for the
following biological experiments.

The antithrombotic activity assay in vivo
A red wine-colored section appeared in the tail tip of the
rodent in the carrageenan-induced group, tail-thrombosis
length increased and experienced typical dry necrosis. Our
results indicated that 3d could inhibit thrombus formation in vivo; as shown in Table 2 and Figure 4, 3d (20 and
50 mg/kg) decreased the black tail occurrence and tailthrombosis length, comparable with NBP (50 mg/kg) group
and lower than ASP (50 mg/kg). However, Eda (3 mg/kg)
did not decrease the black tail occurrence and tail-thrombosis
length.

The activity of anti-cerebral ischemia
in tMCAO and pMCAO rats
The most common cause of ischemic strokes is occlusion of
the MCA. Hence, we observed the effect of treatment with
3d on ischemic stroke injury by occlusion of MCAO for
2 hours followed by recirculation.43 Sprague Dawley rats
were randomly divided into seven groups as follows: shamoperated group (just separated blood vessels), soybean oil
group (negative control), NBP group (20 mg/kg), Eda group
(3.0 mg/kg), and 3d group (10, 20, and 50 mg/kg). Fifteen

minutes after the onset of MCAO, drugs or vehicle was
administered to rats by ip injection, and the neurological
deficits cores in rats were evaluated by Longa’s method
24 hours after reperfusion. The experiment result showed
no obvious neurological deficit in the sham-operated group.
However, the neurological deficit score in the group of
soybean oil-treated rats significantly increased 24 hours
after reperfusion. On the contrary, the neurobehavioral
function score with 3d (10, 20, and 50 mg/kg) treatment
significantly decreased, comparable with Eda-treated group,
and treatment with 3d dose improved the neurological score
24 hours after ischemia in a dose-dependent manner in
Figure 5. Meanwhile, we also observed the effect of treatment
with 3d on ischemic stroke injury by occlusion of MCAO for
24 hours. Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into
five groups as follows: sham-operated group (just separated
blood vessels), 50% propanediol group (negative control),
NBP group (50 mg/kg), Eda group (3.0 mg/kg), and 3d group
(50 mg/kg). Two hours after the onset of MCAO, drugs or
vehicle was administered to rats by ip injection, and the

neurobehavioral function score with 3d (50 mg/kg) treatment
also decreased (Figure 5).

Infarct assessment
The ischemic infarct volume of each group of rats was assessed
by the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay. As shown
in Figure 6A and C, no infarct volume was observed in the
sham-operated group, whereas the model group exhibited a
white infarct area. From Figure 6B and D, we could see that
3d significantly reduced the infarct size. With doses of 10, 20,
and 50 mg/kg in tMCAO rats, the infarct size in the 3d-treated
groups was reduced by 30.22% (10 mg/kg), 63.84% (20 mg/kg),
and 76.13% (50 mg/kg), respectively. In addition, the effect of
moderate- and high-dose 3d was comparable with that of Eda
(69.65%) and more potent than that of NBP (26.19%). Interestingly, 3d significantly reduced the infarct size at doses of 50 mg/
kg in pMCAO rats; the effect of 3d (50 mg/kg) was more potent
than that of NBP (50 mg/kg) and Eda (3 mg/kg).

Histopathological analysis
H&E staining analysis suggested that 3d could significantly
attenuate cerebral damage. As shown in Figure 7, the H&E
stain of the cerebral cortex in the model group showed a large
area of infarction in the cerebral cortex, neuronal perikarya
shrinkage, and microglial cells, in addition to degeneration
of a large number of nerve cells in the vacuoles. However,
compared with that in the model group, drug-treated groups
exhibited minor infarction of cerebral cortex, and less neuronal perikarya shrinkage in the brains, particularly in those
exposed to the highest dose of 3d.

Free radical scavenging activity in HT22
cells
A growing body of evidence suggested that oxidative stress
plays an important role in ischemic stroke reperfusion

injury, 44,45 which can exacerbate ischemic brain damage through the generation of ROS, such as superoxide
anions (O2•−), hydroxyl radicals (OH•), and NO, and H2O2.
Hydroxyl radicals (OH•) can damage DNA and have high
cytotoxicity.46,47 NBP can reduce damage of oxidative stress.
Thus, we hypothesized that 3d might have antioxidative
stress effect. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated its
scavenging activities in murine HT22 cells, which are commonly used for the analysis of diseases related to oxidative
neuronal cell death.48–52 The influence of H2O2 on HT22 cell
survival was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and confirmed
by microscopic evaluation. The 100 µM 3d remarkably
increased the H 2O 2-treated HT22 viability percentage
(74.25%), compared with 51.45% of only H 2O2-treated
HT22 cells. The neuroprotective effect of 3d exceeded that
of NBP and Eda (71.55% and 69.87%, respectively) at the
same dosage (Figure 8). The results implied that 3d could
protect HT22 cells from H2O2-induced cytotoxicity damage
and might be a free radical scavenger.

Radical-scavenging activity in vivo
Postischemic reperfusion could enhance the formation of
ROS in brain tissue,52–55 whereas endogenous antioxidants,
including SOD, GSH-Px, and catalase, could scavenge
ROS. Thus, to evaluate radical-scavenging activity of 3d
in ischemic stroke rats, we evaluated the levels of GSH-Px,
SOD, and the content of MDA (an indicator of lipid

Figure 8 Effect of 3d on H2O2-induced cytotoxicity in HT22 cells.
Notes: Data were expressed as the mean ± SD of each group of cells from four
separate experiments. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Newman-keuls test: #P,0.05 vs the H2O2-treated group.

peroxidation) and NO in the brain tissues. Compared with
the sham group, the content of SOD in the model group was
decreased by 26.22% (from 88.66 to 65.41 U/mg), whereas
the content of SOD in the 3d-treated group (10, 20, and
50 mg/kg), NBP-treated group, and Eda-treated group incre­
ased in comparison with the model group (Figure 9A). The
GSH-Px activity in the ischemic core of rats in the model
group was significantly decreased by 27.12% (from 30.17 to
21.98 nmol/mg), as shown in Figure 9B, compared with that
in the sham group. However, the levels of GSH-Px activity in
3d-treated group (50 mg/kg) and Eda-treated group (3 mg/kg)
were significantly higher than that in the model animals.
Meanwhile, we measured the tissue content of MDA and the
activity level of NO and found that these were significantly
higher in the model group than in the sham group, whereas 3d
treatment attenuated the increase in MDA and NO levels after
reperfusion. Treatment with 3d (50 mg/kg) decreased the
content of the cerebral cortex MDA by 26.16% (from 3.02 to
2.23 nmol/mg) and NO by 52.32% (from 1.51 to 0.72 U/mg),
compared with that in the model group (as shown in Figure 9C
and D). In addition, the effect of 3d on the brain MDA and
NO levels was much stronger with the increase in dosage.
The NO activity of the 20 mg/kg 3d-treated rats (1.01 U/mg)
was comparable with that of the 20 mg/kg NBP-treated
group (0.92 U/mg). Interestingly, after treatment with 3d in
ischemic reperfusion rats, the levels of GSH-Px and SOD
activity in ischemia penumbra were recovered to near the
nonischemic control level and the content of MDA and NO
activity remarkably decreased.

Study on the pharmacokinetics and
biodistribution of 3d
An ideal anti-ischemic stroke drug should be quickly absorbed
into blood circulation and permeate the cerebral infarction
tissues following oral administration. The plasma concentration-time profiles of 3d are shown in Figure 10. These
are obtained following oral administration or iv injection of
10 mg/kg of 3d in Wistar rats. As shown in Table 3, the AUC
(min×µg/mL) of oral dose (10 mg/kg) and iv injection dose
(10 mg/kg) were 770.6±19.6 and 821.5±41.9 min×µg/mL,
respectively. The ∼90% absolute bioavailability observed
suggested that most of the compound 3d was absorbed into
the intestine, which might make up for the deficiency of NBP
with its low bioavailability. The pharmacokinetic parameters
were calculated by different compartment model fitting using
the WinNonlin software.
After tail vein administration of 3d at a dosage of 10 mg/kg
to KM mice (18–22 g), the mean concentrations of 3d in heart,

Conclusion
Antiplatelet aggregation activity screening results suggested
that the target compounds 3a–i bearing all kinds of straight/
branch-chained alkyl groups showed different antiplatelet
aggregation activity. The straight-chained alkyl groups at the
3-position of isoindoline significantly affected its antiplatelet
aggregation activity compared with the branch-chained alkyl
groups; the inhibition of AA-induced platelet aggregation
is as follows: 3b (46.42%) vs 3c (18.51%), 3d (83.33%) vs
3g (17.24%), and the inhibition of ADP-induced platelet
aggregation is as follows: 3b (43.10%) vs 3c (18.86%), 3d
(71.69%) vs 3g (18.86%) at 1.28 mM dosage. Interestingly,
the antiplatelet aggregation activity of these compounds
increased with the extension of alkyl side chains except
for 3d, which exhibited remarkable antiplatelet aggregation activity. These results suggested that isoindoline by
replacement of the oxygen atom at the 2-position of phthalide
showed inhibitory activities against platelet aggregation.
In this study, a series of novel 3-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-1-ones compounds (3a–i) were designed and
synthesized. Antiplatelet aggregation activity screening
results showed that 3d significantly inhibited ADP- and
AA-induced platelet aggregation in vitro and inhibited the
formation of blood clots in vivo. Meanwhile, 3d exhibited
a very high absolute bioavailability at 10 mg/kg dosage
(93.7%) and rapidly distributed in brain tissue to keep high

Drug Design, Development and Therapy 2015:9

blood drug concentration for the treatment of ischemic
strokes, which might make up for the deficiency of NBP.
More importantly, 3d not only exhibited a potent activity
in scavenging free radicals and improved the survival of
HT22 cells against the ROS-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro
but also significantly attenuated the I/R-induced oxidative
stress in ischemic rat brain. For example, 3d could increase
the content of brain antioxidant SOD and GSH and reduce
the levels of brain MDA and NO. The ability of 3d to scavenge free radicals was comparable with that of clinical NBP
or Eda. Most importantly, we observed that treatment of 3d
significantly reduced infarct size, improved neurobehavioral
deficits, and prominently decreased attenuation of cerebral
damage in a rat model of transient and permanent MCA
focal cerebral ischemia. Therefore, the results of our study
demonstrated that 3-alkyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-1-ones,
a novel style of compounds, might be promising candidate
drugs for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, and that 3d
may be a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and
treatment of clinical stroke. In addition, the neuroprotective
effects of 3d might involve multiple mechanisms. Therefore,
further studies are needed to reveal other pharmacological
mechanisms of 3d for the treatment of ischemic stroke in
the future.
