Background and Purpose—We aimed to determine a possible synergistic effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF) and bone marrow–derived mononuclear cells (BM MNC) after stroke in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
Methods—Male spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and randomly assigned
to daily injection of 50 μg/kg G-CSF for 5 days starting 1 hour after stroke (groups 1, 2, and 3) with additional intravenous
transplantation of 1.5×10E7 BM MNC per kilogram at 6 hours (group 2) or 48 hours (group 3) after stroke, or control
treatment (group 4). Circulating leukocyte counts and functional deficits, infarct volume, and brain edema were repeatedly
assessed in the first week and first month.
Results—G-CSF treatment led to a significant neutrophilia, to a reversal of postischemic depression of circulating
leukocytes, and to a significantly improved functional recovery without affecting the infarct volume or brain edema. BM
MNC cotransplantation was neutral after 6 hours, but reversed the functional effect of G-CSF after 48 hours. Short-term
investigation of combined G-CSF and BM MNC treatment at 48 hours indicated splenic accumulation of granulocytes
and transplanted cells, accompanied by a significant rise of granulocytes in the circulation and the ischemic brain.
Conclusions—G-CSF improved functional recovery in spontaneously hypertensive rats, but this effect was abolished by
cotransplantation of BM MNC after 48 hours. In the spleen, transplanted cells may hinder the clearance of granulocytes
that were massively increased by G-CSF. Increased circulation and infiltration of granulocytes into the ischemic brain
may be detrimental for stroke outcome.   (Stroke. 2014;45:2431-2437.)

troke remains a major challenge of modern medicine,
belonging to the most frequent causes of death and permanent disability, whereas causal treatment is not applicable
to most patients. Unfortunately, many promising drug candidates got lost in translation, with the hematopoietic hormone
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) being one of
the most recent examples.1 However, this result strikingly contrasts with the convincing preclinical data for G-CSF2,3 and
may be owed to the fact that therapeutic effect sizes decline
with increasing study population heterogeneity and complexity. Hence, enhancing the therapeutic effect, for instance, by
synergistic combination4 of G-CSF with another favorable
approach may afford its clinical use.
Evidence exists that the mobilization of bone marrow (BM)
cells, either as endogenous response,5 or by G-CSF treatment6 is

protective after stroke and significantly improves neurological
outcome. However, the latter process requires a successive degradation of cell-arresting stromal cell-derived factor 1 within
the BM7 and thus begins delayed after stroke. By contrast,
intravenously transplanted BM-derived mononuclear cells (BM
MNC) rapidly increase cerebral blood flow and reduced tissue
damage after acute and chronic brain ischemia.8,9 We, therefore,
hypothesized that the delayed mobilization by G-CSF could be
compensated by early cotransplantation of BM MNC, which is
also an established preclinical stroke therapy.10
To test this hypothesis, we applied a classical G-CSF regime
extended by cotransplantation of syngeneic BM MNC at 6 or 48
hours after experimental stroke. The study was planned in line
with recommendations for good preclinical stroke research,11
including the use of comorbid animals and long-term monitoring

of functional and imaging end points. Surprisingly, our study
showed that combining G-CSF and BM MNC at 48 hours had
significant adverse effects on the neurological outcome. Further
mechanistic experiments indicated an interaction of granulocytes, which were massively mobilized by G-CSF, and transplanted BM MNC in the spleen. The consecutive spillover of
granulocytes may finally explain the unfavorable outcome.
Although our experiments failed to provide a novel preclinical
approach for stroke, it emphasizes the importance of the immune
system for the development and translation of stroke therapies.

Experimental Stroke
Downloaded from http://stroke.ahajournals.org/ by guest on October 4, 2016

Animal experiments were performed according to the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National
Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996) and
approved by legal authorities (TVV 12/11). Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR; Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany; 12 weeks of age)
were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and subjected to permanent right middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO).

Experimental Set Up and Treatment
Animals were randomly assigned to following experimental groups:
(1) G-CSF monotherapy (G-CSF; n=18) with daily intraperitoneal injection of 50 μg/kg body weight G-CSF for 5 days starting 1
hour after pMCAO; (2) G-CSF plus intravenous transplantation of
1.5×10E7 BM MNC per kilogram body weight at 6 hours after pMCAO (G-CSF+BM MNC 6 hours; n=18); (3) G-CSF plus intravenous
transplantation of 1.5×10E7 BM MNC per kilogram body weight at
48 hours after pMCAO (G-CSF+BM MNC 48 hours; n=18); (4) control group (control; n=18) receiving phosphate buffered saline instead
of G-CSF and BM MNC. Stroke induction, treatments, and analyses
were performed by investigators blinded to group allocation.

Study End Points
Infarct volume and space-occupying effect were determined by magnetic resonance imaging at days 1, 3, 7, and 30. Neurological deficits
were assessed by the adhesive removal test at days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28.
Circulating leukocytes were identified by specific antigens (Table I in the
online-only Data Supplement) within the first week after stroke using flow
cytometry. Cytokine levels were repeatedly measured by multiparametric
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At day 30 after stroke, expressions
of plasticity and inflammation-related genes were assessed by quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction. T cells were visualized by immunofluorescence staining and counted within the infarct border and the entire
ischemic hemisphere.

Biodistribution and Short-Term Effects of Cell
Transplantation
In a subgroup analysis, animals were randomly assigned to groups 1,
3, and 4 (n=3 per group). Distribution of PKH26-labeled BM MNC
and immune cell frequencies were determined in the blood, BM, and
single cell lysates of the spleen and brain at 52 hours after stroke by
flow cytometry. Splenic gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines was investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Results
Study Enrollment
All animals except for 1 control (1.4%) survived pMCAO.
One animal of G-CSF+BM MNC 6 hours group was excluded

because of partial infarction. Two animals (one in control and
one in G-CSF+BM MNC 6 hours) died during day 3 magnetic
resonance imaging. Further animals were excluded solely from
magnetic resonance imaging because of technical problems
(Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). Finally, 1 animal
with G-CSF monotherapy was excluded from behavioral tests
because of lack of compliance.

Characterization of Cell Graft
Previously isolated and cryopreserved syngeneic BM MNC
grafts were thawed and characterized by flow cytometry. We
observed only minor variation of the main leukocyte populations among the different cohorts (n=8). Mature B cells compromised the major part of the graft (48.2±6.5%), followed by
myeloid CD11b+ cells (22.2±3.0%), T cells (4.9±0.5%), and
remaining uncharacterized leukocytes (CD45only: 27.2±3.7%).
7.1±1.3% of BM MNC expressed the CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4), whereas we did not found detectable CXCR4
expression by CD34+ cells. Hematopoietic progenitor cells
analyzed by coexpression of CD45 and CD34 accounted for
5.0±1.5% of all BM MNC with a frequency of 2.0±0.3% for
granulocyte/monocyte progenitors determined by colony-forming unit–granulocyte/macrophage. Analysis of programmed cell
death among the graft revealed 23.5±3.3% early apoptotic cells,
6.7±2.5% late apoptotic cells, and 1.9±1.0% necrotic cells.

Peripheral Leukocyte Counts
The impact of G-CSF administration and additional BM MNC
transplantation on peripheral leukocyte counts was analyzed 6,
48, 52, 96, and 144 hours after pMCAO. Expectably, G-CSF
treatment caused a distinct increase of peripheral leukocyte
counts, reaching its peak at 48 hours with a successive normalization until 144 hours after stroke. However, additional administration of BM MNC after either 6 or 48 hours did not impact
overall leukocyte counts (Figure 1). The increase of leukocytes
was predominantly driven by granulocytes and, to a much lesser
extent, by monocytes, T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells
(Figure 1). Four hours after transplantation of BM MNC at 48
hours, we observed a statistically significant increase of granulocyte counts in the G-CSF+BM MNC 48 hours group compared
with the G-CSF monotherapy (Figure 1). When comparing
leukocyte counts of stroke and naive animals, we observed a
considerable decrease of T and B cells, monocytes and natural
killer cells 48 hours after stroke. This observation is consistent
with recent studies and corresponds to the phenomenon of poststroke immunodepression.12 Although the suppression of T cells,
monocytes, and natural killer cells was limited to 48 hours, we
found a persistent depression of B cells (Figure 1). Interestingly,
at 48 hours after stroke, poststroke cellular immunodepression
was largely reversed by G-CSF treatment, independent of a concomitant cell therapy. Moreover, G-CSF provoked a significant
downregulation of CXCR4 on peripheral blood mononuclear
cells at 48 hours (Figure 1). CXCR4 expression completely
recovered in groups with G-CSF monotherapy or additional early
(6 hours) BM MNC administration, but remained suppressed in
the G-CSF+BM MNC 48 hours group. Finally, differentiation of
T cells into T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells, CD4/CD8 doublepositive, as well as CD4/CD8 double-negative T cells (data not

peripheral leukocyte counts. Cell counts from naive
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were included
as reference (grey area: upper and lower SD; n=3). All
animals that received granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF) showed a 3-fold increase of leukocytes
at 48 hours that successively normalized until 144
hours. As illustrated by exemplary flow cytometric forward/side scatter (FSC/SSC) plots of blood samples
at 48 hours, granulocytes were the main contributors
of leukocytosis. At 52 hours, transplantation of bone
marrow–derived mononuclear cells (BM MNC) after
48 hours caused a significant increase of granulocytes
compared with G-CSF monotherapy. The transient
decline of monocytes, T, and natural killer (NK) cells
in consequence of stroke was reversed by G-CSF at
48 hours and partly at 96 hours. The suppression of B
cells was persistent until 144 hours and was only partially attenuated by G-CSF. The initial decline of CXC
chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) expression was transient after G-CSF or G-CSF+BM MNC 6 hours, but
persistent over the first 144 hours after G-CSF+BM
MNC 48 hours. pMCAO indicates permanent right

shown) and regulatory T cells (Figure 1) revealed no statistically
significant differences among the treatment groups.

Serum Cytokines
Serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-17A,
monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α changed significantly as a function of
time (P<0.05), whereas interferon-γ levels remained stable
≤144 hours after stroke (Figure I in the online-only Data
Supplement). At 96 hours, the serum level of macrophage
inflammatory protein-1α was slightly but statistically significant reduced by G-CSF+BM MNC 48 hours. Besides that,
none of the treatments had significant influence on cytokine
levels (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement).

(treatment improves or impairs functional improvement), we a
priori decided to perform a summarized analysis of the functional development by means of an area under the curve. At
the baseline prior to stroke induction, rats needed ≈5 seconds
to notice and remove the sticky tape from their contralateral
forelimb. As expected, we observed a substantial increase of
the tape removal time after stroke (to 91±37 seconds in the
pMCAO-only control), which subsequently declined by ≈50%
within 7 days to reach a constant level reflecting the permanent neurological deficit (Figure 3A). The area under the curve
analysis revealed a statistically significant decrease of the tape
removal time in G-CSF and a strong trend in the G-CSF+BM
MNC 6 hours group (P=0.05). By contrast, the latter effect was

Infarct Volume and Brain Edema
At day 1 after stroke, the mean edema-corrected infarct volume
(%HLVe) amounted to 15.7±4.5% of the hemisphere without
any differences between the experimental groups. Although
the infarct volume remained constant during the first week
after stroke, we observed a 30% increase of the infarct volume
to 19.2±3.7% at day 30 (Figure 2). G-CSF monotherapy or
combination therapy had no detectable impact on the infarct
volume at any time point. The space-occupying effect of the
ischemic lesion (%HSE) was maximally pronounced at day
1 after stroke and successively declined during the first week
(Figure 2). At day 30, we measured negative values for %HSE
that likely correspond to loss of hemispheric brain tissue and
is consistent with the aforementioned increase of infarct volume at the same time point. Neither the early edema–related
space-occupying effect nor the delayed brain atrophy was
influenced by one of the treatments (Figure 2).

Functional Outcome After Stroke
We next used the adhesive removal test to monitor the clinical
course within 30 days after stroke. To clearly define a hypothesis

day 1 and successively declined until day 7 (ie, brain edema). The
increase of %HLVe between days 7 and 30 was accompanied by
negative values of %HSE at day 30 (ie, brain atrophy). None of
the parameters (corrected lesion volume, brain edema, and brain
atrophy) was influenced by any of the treatments; n=11 to 16
animals per group.

using the adhesive removal test (ART). Experimental
stroke caused a significant increase of ART time in
all experimental groups, which was less pronounced
after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
and G-CSF plus bone marrow–derived mononuclear
cells (BM MNC) 6 hours treatment. BM MNC transplantation at 48 hours was performed 12 hours
before the ART at day 2. The area under the curve

strong trend by G-CSF+BM MNC 6 hours; †P=0.05.

or cell transplantation. The representative illustration
of the infarct border zone showed a massive activation of ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1

with solanum tuberosum lectin [STL]). By contrast,
T cells remote from the ischemic lesion were exclusively found within vessels. pMCAO indicates permanent right middle cerebral artery occlusion. *P<0.05,

abolished in the G-CSF+BM MNC 48 hours group (Figure 3A).
Body weights of all animals completely attained presurgery levels within the following days after stroke. Interestingly, after 30
days, we observed a significant increase of body weight in animals receiving BM MNC at 6 or 48 hours (Figure 3B).

Expression of Plasticity-Related Genes and Chronic
Inflammation
Next, we investigated the expression of genes that are involved
in neural regeneration and delayed inflammation in the ischemic hemisphere. Thirty days after stroke, the expression of
Brevican, Neurocan, Gap-43 (Figure 3C), Versican, MARCKS,
and Slit1 (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement) was
not affected by any treatment. The growth factors insulin-like
growth factor-1 (Figure 3C) and brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement) showed
a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the ischemic hemisphere, but were
not altered by G-CSF or G-CSF+BM MNC. Similarly, expression levels of IL-1β and CD45 were increased in the ischemic
hemisphere 30 days after stroke, but did not differ among
the experimental groups (Figure 3C). Immunohistochemical
investigation revealed numerous T cells in the ischemic lesion
30 days after pMCAO, most of them located in the cortical
infarct border. Neither G-CSF monotherapy nor cotransplantation of BM MNC altered T-cell counts in the ischemic brain
(Figure 3D).

Short-Term Effects of Delayed Combination
Treatment
Finally, we tried to elucidate the mechanisms behind the
antagonizing effect of late BM MNC transplantation on the
protective effect of G-CSF. Therefore, BM MNC were stained

by the lipophilic membrane dye PKH26 to track short-term
biodistribution. Labeling efficiency was 99.3±0.08% (n=3),
and the dye had no impact on composition or vitality of the
graft (data not shown). Four hours after intravenous transplantation of labeled BM MNC, we could identify PKH26+
cells in all samples investigated (blood, spleen, BM, and
brain tissue; Table). The composition of recovered PKH26+
cells varied from the original graft, indicating differences in
biodistribution or survival among the BM MNC subpopulations (Figure 4A). In the spleen, numerous PKH26+ cells
were found in the marginal zone between red and white pulp
(Figure 4A), partly internalized by ionized calcium-binding
adapter molecule-1–positive marginal zone macrophages
(Figure II in the online-only Data Supplement). Gene expression analysis of spleen tissue revealed a significant increase of
monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and IL-10 solely in the BM
MNC 48 hours group (Figure 4B). By contrast, we observed
a G-CSF–related increase of IL-1β mRNA (Figure 4B). Gene
expression of chemokine (CC motif) ligand 6, chemokine
(CXC motif) ligand 2, chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 5, highmobility group box 1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α did
not differ among the treatment groups (Table IV in the onlineonly Data Supplement). Spleen weights were significantly
increased by G-CSF treatment, but not further influenced by
BM MNC transplantation (control 530±23 mg versus G-CSF
640±41 mg versus G-CSF+BM MNC 48 hours, 629±14 mg;
P<0.05 by 1-way ANOVA). Flow cytometric analyses exposed
that the increased spleen weights were primarily caused by a
tremendous increase of splenic granulocytes in both groups
receiving G-CSF. The latter effect was most pronounced after
BM MNC transplantation at 48 hours (Figure 4C). By using
an annexin V/7-aminoactinomycin D flow cytometric assay,

we found most of the splenic granulocytes being vital. A small
fraction of necrotic granulocytes was also increased by BM
MNC when compared with the G-CSF group (Figure 4C).
Finally, we quantified immune cells within the ischemic
(Figure 4D) and contralateral hemisphere (Figure III in the
online-only Data Supplement) 52 hours after experimental
stroke. Transplantation of BM MNC after 48 hours caused
a significant increase of vital granulocytes in the ischemic
hemisphere when compared with the G-CSF or control group
(Figure 4D). Interestingly, almost half of all granulocytes in

the ischemic brain were early apoptotic; however, neither
G-CSF monotherapy nor BM MNC cotransplantation had an
effect on the extent of this fraction (Figure 4D).

Discussion
In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential synergistic effect of 2 successfully tested experimental treatments for
stroke: the repeated injection of G-CSF combined with transplantation of BM MNC. Our study yielded 3 major findings:
first, we observed that G-CSF, neither alone nor in combination with BM MNC, had any impact on our primary end point,
the infarct volume. Second, we found that a monotherapy with
G-CSF and the cotransplantation of BM MNC after 6 hours
significantly improved functional recovery. Surprisingly, this
effect was entirely abolished when BM MNC were given after
48 hours. Finally, we found that G-CSF with and without
auxiliary cell therapy significantly altered systemic immune
responses to stroke.
The neuroprotective effect of G-CSF has been discovered
and mechanistically defined in a landmark study by Schneider
et al,13 who showed that G-CSF provides strong antiapoptotic effects in neurons exposed to ischemia. Many studies

of B cells in the blood, spleen, bone marrow (BM), and brain. In the circulation, primarily CD11b+ monocytes were positive for the cell marker
PKH26, whereas T cells and CD45-only cells were enriched in the spleen and BM. Almost all PKH26+ cells in the brain were CD11b+. Immunofluorescence staining of spleen sections revealed an accumulation of PKH26+ cells in the marginal zone around the lymphatic follicles. B,
Gene expression analysis of the spleen showed a significant increase of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin (IL)-10
after BM MNC transplantation. By contrast, IL-1β mRNA was increased by G-CSF, but not further affected by cell therapy. C, Flow cytometric quantification of major leukocyte populations in the spleen showed a distinct increase of granulocytes after G-CSF treatment, further
increased by BM MNC transplantation. The vast majority of splenic granulocytes were vital, reflecting the group differences of total granulocytes. Necrotic granulocyte counts were doubled by G-CSF and quintupled by G-CSF+BM MNC 48 hours.

reproduced this finding and 2 meta-analyses consistently confirmed a significant impact of G-CSF on the infarct volume,
the most frequently used surrogate for neuroprotection.2,3
Interestingly, the same meta-analysis revealed, in contrast to
one recent study,14 that the infarct volume was not influenced
by G-CSF treatment in permanent stroke,2 likely owing to the
fact that the neuroprotective time window is shorter in permanent stroke (3 hours) compared with the classical ischemia/
reperfusion models (up to 12 hours).15 In SHR, neuroprotection is even limited to the first 60 minutes after MCAO.16 We
hence reasoned that the lack of influence of G-CSF treatment
and cell transplantation on the ischemic lesion is likely caused
by the absence of reperfusion and the comorbidities present
in SHR. Conversely, the functional effect of G-CSF observed
in our study is likely mediated by mechanism beyond neuroprotection. This is highly relevant for translational stroke
research,11,15 but it should also be noted that inbred SHR may
be compromised by genetic aberrations that could bias the
value of our experiment.
G-CSF has an impact on various pathophysiological
aspects relevant for stroke outcome: it promotes endogenous
neurogenesis and angiogenesis, modulates immune responses,
reduces brain edema, and enhances structural and functional
regeneration capacities of the central nervous system.17 These
mechanisms could explain the significant functional improvement after G-CSF treatment that was prevalent in most of
the published preclinical experiments2,3 being corroborated
by ours. Angiogenesis and neurogenesis were not investigated here. However, we examined the expression of various
growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting genes during the
late stage of poststroke axonal sprouting18 (day 30) but found
no differences between any treatment regime and control.
Furthermore, and again in contrast to another study using a
reperfusion model of stroke,19 we found that the brain edema
was also not influenced by G-CSF.
With respect to the early functional improvement observed
in our study, we suggest acute immunologic interactions as one
key mechanism for the efficacy of G-CSF and its antagonization by late BM MNC transplantation. Two days after stroke,
we found a significant decline of circulating CXCR4+ mononuclear cells in all treatment groups, likely as a consequence of
chemokine receptor downregulation by G-CSF.20 Recent studies
showed that early CXCR4 antagonism significantly improved
outcome after stroke by regulating the infiltration of leukocytes
into the ischemic brain.21 In this manner, G-CSF may dampen
central nervous system inflammation and damage, and in fact,
we found a strong trend toward less macrophages/dendritic
cells infiltrating the ischemic lesion in G-CSF–treated animals.
Interestingly, we found a recovery of depressed spleen
weights and circulating leukocyte counts in all groups receiving G-CSF. Postischemic immunodepression is a consequence of an overactivated cholinergic anti-inflammatory
pathway finally contributing to morbidity after stroke.12 We
found no evidence for infections, such as increased mortality
or decreased body weights in our study, but the restoration of
immunocompetence by G-CSF may have protected the brain
from chronic central nervous system inflammation.22 In fact,
we found ongoing immune responses including an accumulation of T cells at the infarct border at day 30 after stroke, but

T-cell counts and brain atrophy were not influenced by G-CSF
treatment or accompanying cell therapy.
One surprising finding of our study was that transplantation of BM MNC after 48 hours completely neutralized the
beneficial effect of G-CSF. Early transplantation of BM MNC
after transient stroke in SHR have had no positive or negative impact on functional outcome23; however, it is possible
that late BM MNC transplantation is detrimental after stroke
and simply deleted the protective effects of the accompanying
G-CSF therapy. This notion remains hypothetical because we
did not investigate the exclusive effect of late BM MNC transplantation here. Nevertheless, adverse effects of BM-derived
cells have been described in animal models of diabetes mellitus and arteriosclerosis,24,25 suggesting a compromised cell
graft under translationally relevant conditions of hyperglycemia and hypertension.26,27
We found almost 30% of the BM MNC being apoptotic
before transplantation, a finding that may reflect hypertension-related oxidative stress in the BM.26,27 In steady state,
circulating apoptotic cells were trapped by specialized splenic
macrophages in the marginal zone between red and white
pulp.28 This endogenous scavenging system carefully downregulates immune-stimulatory functions and helps to maintain
self-tolerance.29 It is thus tempting to speculate that the intravenous transplantation of numerous (pre)apoptotic BM MNC
may induce endogenous anti-inflammatory programs,30,31 and
in fact, we found an accumulation of BM MNC in the splenic
marginal zones together with increased expression of antiinflammatory mediators.
Intriguingly, this assumed universal mechanism for intravenously administered cells may also explain the interaction
effect between late BM MNC and G-CSF found in our study.
Circulating granulocytes have a short half-life and are continuously cleared in the splenic marginal zone. Mice deficient for
marginal zone macrophages develop increased granulocyte
counts and IL-1β levels.32 Accordingly, we found that treatment with G-CSF caused a 10-fold increase of splenic granulocytes and 2-fold increase of IL-1β expression, indicating an
overload of the granulocyte clearance system. The simultaneous engagement of marginal zone macrophages with transplanted BM MNC and massively increased granulocytes may
further overload this scavenging system, as it has been shown
after the application of polystyrene particles.33 This would
explain the significant increase of vital granulocytes in the
blood, spleen, and brain of animals that received BM MNC at
the peak point of G-CSF–induced neutrophilia. Higher neutrophil counts in the brain could finally explain the negative
functional effect either by disturbing the microcirculation or
by releasing toxic mediators.34

Conclusions
In our study, we could confirm the beneficial effect of G-CSF
on long-term functional recovery, but not on neuroprotection
after stroke in hypertensive rats. The cotreatment with BM
MNC was without effect after 6 hours, but reversed the protective effect of G-CSF after 48 hours, probably by overloading
the splenic scavenging system by the apoptotic fraction of BM
MNC and massively increased granulocytes.

Supplemental methods
Experimental stroke
Animal experiments were conducted according to the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No.
85-23, revised 1996), and approved by the appropriate regional authorities (reference number
TVV 12/11). A total of 81 spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR; Charles River, Sulzfeld,
Germany) at the age of 12 weeks were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (100mg/kg)
and xylazine (10mg/kg) given as an intraperitoneal injection. During the surgical procedure,
body core temperature was constantly measured and maintained at 37.5°C. Experimental
stroke was induced by permanent occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery (pMCAO) as
described previously.1 Briefly, the right temporal scull bone and dura mater were opened, and
the subjacent middle cerebral artery was permanently occluded by thermocoagulation. Health
status including the body weight was monitored daily within the first week after stroke and
weekly thereafter. The exclusion criteria were defined as follows: i) weight loss of more than
20% body weight during week 1; ii) absence of a cortical brain lesion typical for distal
MCAO in the MR sequence; iii) incomplete injection of G-CSF, cell suspension or vehicle
solution.
Experimental group allocation
In the first study, we defined the reduction of the infarct volume (%HLVe, see below) by at
least 30% as primary endpoint. Accordingly, the sample sizes were a priori calculated for an
expected difference of the mean of 30% with α=0.05 and β=0.8 for a one-way ANOVA
(Sigma Plot version 11.0). The expected standard deviation (σ=3.2 %HLVe) was obtained
from a previous study (day 1 and day 3 after pMCAO from SHRs).2 SHRs were randomly
assigned (balanced randomization by lot) to one of the following experimental groups: (i) GCSF monotherapy group (henceforth G-CSF, n=18) with a daily intraperitoneal injection of
50 µg/kg Neupogen (rhG-CSF; Amgen GmbH, Thousand Oaks, USA) for 5 days starting 1h
after pMCAO; (ii) combination group with early cell transplantation (henceforth G-CSF+BM
MNC 6h, n=18) with a G-CSF schedule according to (i) and an additional transplantation of
1.5x10E7 BM MNCs per kg bodyweight at 6h after pMCAO; (iii) combination group with
late cell transplantation (henceforth G-CSF+BM MNC 48h, n=18) with a G-CSF schedule
according to (i) and an additional transplantation of 1.5x10E7 BM MNCs per kg bodyweight
at 48h after pMCAO; (iv) control group (henceforth control, n=18) receiving phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) instead of G-CSF and BM MNCs. The administrations in all treatment
groups were completely controlled by PBS injections, meaning, for instance, that the G-CSF
group received PBS injections at 6h and 48h after stroke.
In the second study, we investigated the distribution of PKH26-labeled BM MNC and the
short-term immunological responses to late transplantation of BM MNC (48h). Nine animals
were randomly assigned to the following experimental groups (in accordance with the first
study): (i) G-CSF, n=3; (iii) G-CSF+BM MNC 48h, n=3; (iv) control group, n=3.

BM MNC isolation and transplantation
Syngeneic rat bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM MNC) were enriched by magnetic
depletion of granulocytes as described previously3 and cryo-preserved until further use. At the
day of cell transplantation, BM MNCs were re-thawed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium containing 4.5g/L glucose (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany) and 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS; PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), washed twice in medium. Vital cell
numbers were determined by the trypan blue exclusion method using a hemocytometer.
Cellular composition of cell grafts was characterized by flow cytometry for B cells
(CD45R+), T cells (CD3+) and myeloid cells (CD11b+ and RP1-; for details please refer to
supplemental table I). CXCR4+ BM MNC were identified by polyclonal rabbit anti-rat
CXCR4 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) which was secondly labeled with donkey anti-rabbit PE
(ebioscience, San Diego, USA). Hematopoietic progenitors expressing CD34 (polyclonal goat
anti-rat; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA) were secondly conjugated with donkey anti-goat
PE-Cy™5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, USA) and differentiated in bipotent
hematopoietic progenitors using granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit assay (CFUGM) as described elsewhere.3
For the analysis of the biodistribution, BM MNC were labeled with the red fluorescent dye
PKH26 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, USA).
Prior to transplantation, 1.5x10E7 BM MNCs per kg bodyweight were resuspended in 800µl
PBS. Cell suspension was slowly administered via the tail vein. The application of G-CSF,
BM MNCs or vehicle solution was performed by an investigator blinded to the group
allocation 12h prior to functional testing and MR imaging.
Analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes and cytokine levels
Peripheral blood and serum samples were collected at 6h, 48h, 52h, 96h and 144h after
pMCAO. Anticoagulated blood samples were harvested in 0,2M EDTA and stored in EDTAmonovettes for hematological analysis. Absolute leukocyte counts were determined by an
animal blood cell counter (scil Vet abc, SCIL animal care company GmbH, Viernheim,
Germany). Leukocyte subsets were identified and categorized according to their antigen
expression (for details please refer to supplemental table I) using multichannel flow
cytometry. Natural killer (NK) cells were identified by biotinylated anti-CD161a and
secondly conjugated with streptavidin Horizon™V500 (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg,
Germany). Purified CXCR4 was secondly labeled with donkey anti–rabbit PE as mentioned
above (ebioscience, San Diego, USA). For this, 50µL of blood were diluted in 50µL PBS and
incubated with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies (supplemental table I) for 20min at 4°C.
Erythrocytes were lysed by short-term incubation (30 seconds) with distilled water followed
by two washing steps with PBS containing 3% fetal calf serum (PBS/3% FCS). Remaining
leukocytes were resuspended in 300µL PBS/3% FCS. Flow cytometric acquisition and
analysis was performed using a FACS Canto II equipped with FACS Diva software (BD
Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). For the quantification of circulating cytokine levels,
serum (n=6 per group and day, randomly assigned by lot) was separated from 300µl
coagulated blood samples by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5min and stored in aliquots at 80°C. Cytokine secretion levels of IFNγ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17A, MCP-1 and MIP-1α were
analyzed by multiparametric ELISA (Multimetrix GmbH, Regensburg, Germany).
Biodistribution study and flow cytometric analysis of spleen and brain tissue
Animals from the second study were sacrificed exactly 52h after stroke and transcardially
perfused with 200mL of ice-cold PBS. Spleens, femur bones and brains were removed.
Spleens were weighed and segmented into three parts for (i) histological analyses, (ii) for
gene expression analysis and (iii) for flow cytometric analyses.

For flow cytometry, spleens were mechanically dissected using razor blades and further
dissociated through 100µm and 40µm cell strainers using glass pestles. Bone marrow was
harvested from one femur bone by repeated flushing with PBS. Total cell counts and viability
were determined by trypan blue exclusion in a hemocytometer. Total leukocyte counts were
defined by counting in Turk’s solution. Single cell suspensions of the ischemic and
contralateral brain hemispheres were isolated by mechanical dissection and enzymatic
digestion as described previously4. Immune cells were separated by density gradient
centrifugation on discontinuous Percoll (GE Healthcare, München, Germany) gradients
composed of four sequent layers (80%/38%/21% Percoll covered with cell culture medium).
Cells accumulating in between 80%/38% Percoll were harvested and washed repeatedly.
Total counts of brain leukocytes were determined by additional Trucount Tube measurements
(BD Biosciences). Frequencies of PKH26+ cells and of major leukocyte populations were
assessed by flow cytometry. In total, 1x10E6 isolated spleen or bone marrow cells and
2x10E5 brain cells were incubated with a specific FC-blocking reagent (purified anti-rat
CD32; BD Bioscience) for 10min at 4°C and labeled with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies
(supplemental table I). After incubation for 20min at 4°C, cells were washed and incubated
with annexin V PE-Cy™7 (ebioscience, San Diego, USA) in 100 µL annexin V binding
buffer for 15min at room temperature. After washing, cells were stained with 7-AAD viability
staining solution (ebioscience). Flow cytometric acquisition and analysis was performed by an
investigator blinded to the group allocation using a 3-laser FACS Canto II equipped with
FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences).
Determination of infarct volume
The infarct volume and space occupying effect of the lesion were determined in vivo by
means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at day 1, 3, 7 and 30. Image sequences were
acquired in clinical MR scanner (1.5 T Gyroscan Intera human whole-body spectrometer
equipped with a 47mm loop RF-Coil, Philips). Briefly, animals were anesthetized as
described above. T2-weighted sequences (T2-TSE) consisting of 20 transverse slices (matrix:
224×224; field of view: 50mm; slice thickness: 1mm) were acquired. Hemispheric lesion
volume corrected for edema (%HLVe) and hemispheric space occupying effect (%HSE) of
the lesion were calculated by a blinded investigator as described previously.5
Assessment of functional recovery
Neurological deficits were repeatedly assessed by means of the adhesive removal test (ART)
as described previously.6 Animals were allowed to adapt to the ART conditions for 3 days.
The baseline data was ascertained one day before pMCAO. Following pMCAO, ART was
performed at day 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 by an investigator blinded to group allocation. The time
needed to remove the adhesive tape was measured in technical triplicates that were averaged
for one individual at each day. For the statistical analysis, time series data was summarized as
individual area under the curve (AUC).
Quantitative RT-PCR
Animals were sacrificed and transcardially perfused with 200mL of ice-cold PBS. Spleen
segments, ipsilateral and contralateral brain tissue were manually dissociated by razor blades.
Next, total RNA of 100mg tissue was extracted by homogenization in 1mL Trizol using a
ULTRA-TURRAX® (Ika, Staufen, Germany) and further purified by RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Single-strand cDNA copies were generated from 1µg of total
purified RNA by using random primers (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and Superscript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Quantification of mRNA expression was performed and
monitored using an ABI 7900 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt,

Germany) applying the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 10min, followed
by 50 cycles at 95°C for 15s and 55°C for 1min. All qRT-PCR reactions were conducted in a
total volume of 15µL with addition of Power SYBR Green I PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and gene specific QuantiTect® Primer Assay
(supplemental table III for brain and supplemental table IV for spleen; Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Data was analyzed using the relative standard curve method, normalized on the
average cycle threshold of the housekeeping genes B2m (QT00176295, NM_012512), Rpl13a
(QT00425873, NM_173340), Rpl22 (QT00385119, NM_031104) and Yhwaz (QT02382184,
NM_013011) and normalized to the control group (spleen tissue) or to the contralateral
hemisphere (brain tissue).
Histological analysis
30 days after stroke, animals were sacrificed and transcardially perfused with 200mL of PBS
and 200mL of formalin solution (4%). Removed brains were vitrified in sucrose solution
(30%) and cryoconserved at -80°C. Frozen brains were cut into 20µm coronal sections and
mounted on coated slides. Brain sections (n=4 animals per group, randomly assigned by lot)
were incubated with 5% goat serum and 0.3% Trition-X-100 for 30 minutes, followed by
polyclonal rabbit anti-Iba1 (Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1; 1:200; Wako
Chemicals, Neuss, Germany), monoclonal mouse anti-15-16A1 (1:500; Hycult Biotech,
Beutelsbach, Germany; for T cells) and biotinylated solanum tuberosum lectin (STL; 1:300;
Linaris, Dossenheim, Germany) for 24h at 4°C. Sections were then incubated with goat antirabbit IgG (1:200, Invitrogen), goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Invitrogen) or streptavidin
(Dianova) conjugated with either Alexa Fluor® 488, 546 or Cy5 for 1h at room temperature.
Sections were counterstained with DAPI (2.5µg/mL, Sigma). Fluorescence images were
acquired using a Zeiss LSM710 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Objective: PlanApochromat 63x / 1.40 oil). T cells were counted in 4 brain regions (Bregma anteroposterior
+1.5mm, 1.0mm, 0.5mm and 0.0mm) in technical duplicates using a Stereo Investigator
system (MBF Bioscience). Briefly, two regions of interest (ROI) were defined as “ipsilateral
hemisphere” and “infarct border”, the latter define as a 100µm deep band adjacent to the
border of the pseudocyst. The area of the ROIs, and the T cell count within the ROIs were
determined by an investigator blinded to the group allocation. Finally, T cell counts were
summarized for each biological replicate and indicated as cells per area.
Spleen segments were fixed in formalin solution (4%) for 48h, vitrified in sucrose solution
(30%) and cryoconserved at -80°C. Frozen spleens were cut into 20µm coronal sections and
mounted on coated slides. Sections were incubated with 5% goat serum and 0.3% Trition-X100 for 30 minutes, followed by primary incubation with polyclonal rabbit anti-Iba1 for 24h
at 4°C and secondary labeling with Alexa Fluor® 488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1h
at room temperature. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (2.5µg/mL, Sigma).
Statistical analysis
Peripheral leukocyte counts, summarized ART data, brain histology were analyzed by oneway ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post-hoc test. Time series of serum cytokine levels
and MR investigations were analyzed by repeated measures two-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni’s post-hoc test. Immune cell distribution in spleen and brain tissue was analyzed
by one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All data were displayed as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). Data analysis was performed by Graph Pad Prism (version 5.03).

Supplemental Figures

Supplemental Figure I
Serum protein levels of inflammatory cytokines 48, 96 and 144 hours after stroke onset.
Serum levels of anti-inflammatory (Interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10) and pro-inflammatory (IL-17A,
interferon (IFN) γ and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α) cytokines showed a
moderate increase from 48h to 96h. The chemotactic molecule monocyte chemotactic protein
(MCP)-1 was detectable at relatively high serum levels (around 200 pg/mL serum) but
without any relevant kinetics during the observation period. At 96h, the serum level of MIP1α was slightly, but statistically significant reduced by G-CSF+BM MNC 48h. Apart from
that, none of the treatment regimes had a significant influence on the cytokine levels. *p<0.05
compared to control group determined by repeated measurement two-way ANOVA; n=14-17
animals per group.

Supplemental Figure II
Laser scanning microscopy of the splenic marginal zone. A, a maximum intensity projection
of a 15µm thick confocal stack showed various ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1
(Iba1)+ macrophages. B, the detail is displayed as orthographic projection. PKH26+ signals
could be clearly localized within the cytoplasm of the macrophage. Bar: 10µm

Supplemental Figure III
Flow cytometric analysis of major leukocyte populations in the contralateral hemisphere 52h
after stroke. G-CSF treatment caused a significant increase of granulocytes that was not
further influenced by BM MNC transplantation at 48h. *p<0.05 determined by one-way
ANOVA; n=3 animals per group.
