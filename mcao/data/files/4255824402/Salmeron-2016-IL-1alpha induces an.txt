Abstract
Inﬂammation is a major contributor to neuronal injury and is
associated with poor outcome after acute brain injury such as
stroke. The pro-inﬂammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 is a
critical regulator of cerebrovascular inﬂammation after
ischemic injury, mainly through action of both of its isoforms,
IL-1a and IL-1b, at the brain endothelium. In contrast, the
differential action of these ligands on endothelial activation
and post-stroke angiogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we
demonstrate that IL-1a is chronically elevated in the brain after
experimental stroke suggesting that it is present during poststroke angiogenic periods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
IL-1a is a potent mediator of endothelial activation and inducer
of angiogenic markers in endothelial cells in vitro. Using brain
endothelial cell lines, we found that IL-1a was signiﬁcantly

more potent than IL-1b at inducing endothelial cell activation,
as measured by expression of the pro-angiogenic chemokine
CXCL-1. IL-1a also induced strong expression of the angiogenic mediator IL-6 in a concentration-dependent manner.
Furthermore, IL-1a induced signiﬁcant proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and promoted formation of tube-like
structures that are established key hallmarks of angiogenesis
in vitro. Finally, all of those responses were blocked by the IL-1
receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). In conclusion, our data highlights
a potential new role for IL-1 in brain repair mechanisms and
identiﬁes IL-1a as a potential new therapy to promote poststroke angiogenesis.

Inﬂammation is a key host defense response to infection and
injury, the aim of which is host protection against pathogens,
regeneration of injured tissues, and re-establishment of tissue
homeostasis (Nathan 2002). It is now recognized that
inﬂammation is also a key contributor to neuronal ischemic
injury that occurs after stroke, a leading cause of death and
morbidity worldwide with limited therapeutic options (Paul
et al. 2007). This inﬂammatory response after cerebral
ischemia has long been considered detrimental and because
of its slowly evolving nature, has been identiﬁed as a
potential therapeutic target in acute ischemic stroke (Denes
et al. 2011). Inﬂammation after cerebral ischemia is characterized by central expression of inﬂammatory mediators,
activation of the local innate immune cells of the brain,
activation of the brain cerebrovasculature, and subsequent
opening of the blood–brain barrier that allows for edema and
circulating immune factors into the brain parenchyma,
contributing to secondary brain damage (Wang et al.

2007). A key mediator of inﬂammation after cerebral
ischemia is the pro-inﬂammatory cytokine interleukin-1
(IL-1) (Denes et al. 2011). Microglia, astrocytes, and

endothelial cells express both of the IL-1 isoforms, IL-1a and
IL-1b, after cerebral ischemia (Basu et al. 2004), and both
cytokines contribute to neuronal injury by acting primarily
on endothelial cells and astrocytes (Allen et al. 2012). IL-1
action at the cerebrovasculature is considered a primary
trigger of post-stroke inﬂammation (Luheshi et al. 2011),
and may represent a therapeutic target (Pradillo et al. 2012).
Although IL-1-driven inﬂammation is detrimental during the
acute phase of ischemic injury, inﬂammation also exerts
beneﬁcial effects by promoting brain repair mechanisms and
functional recovery; Indeed, IL-1 induces generation of LG3
in brain cell cultures, a potentially neuroprotective and proangiogenic protein fragment of the extracellular matrix
component perlecan (Saini et al. 2011; Saini and Bix
2012). Furthermore, IL-1 induces central expression of the
acute phase protein pentraxin-3, a key regulator of repair
mechanisms after cerebral ischemia, including glial scar
formation, blood–brain barrier integrity, and resolution of
edema (Rodriguez-Grande et al. 2014), as well as neurogenesis and angiogenesis (Rodriguez-Grande et al. 2015).
Although IL-1-driven repair mechanisms at the cerebrovasculature are gradually being unraveled, the potential role of
IL-1 as a direct regulator of angiogenesis after ischemic
injury is completely unknown. Importantly, we have demonstrated a selective role for IL-1a (but not IL-1b) in activating
endothelial cells to produce LG3 (Saini et al. 2011), and
although IL-1a has been reported to exert pro-angiogenic
effects during peripheral inﬂammation (Salven et al. 2002;
Matsuo et al. 2009), the potential role of IL-1a on brain
angiogenesis has never been explored. Using cultured brain
endothelial cells, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that IL-1a
induces several stages of angiogenesis as well as expression
of key pro-angiogenic markers in brain endothelial cells
in vitro, highlighting the important role of angiogenesis
driven by IL-1a during the repair phase after acute CNS
inﬂammatory conditions.

Materials and methods
Tandem ipsilateral common carotid and middle cerebral artery
occlusion stroke model
The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Kentucky, and
experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of
Health as well as the ARRIVE guidelines. Male (3 months old)
C57/Bl6 mice were subjected to transient tandem ipsilateral
common carotid artery/middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion
(MCAo) for 60 min (Lee et al. 2011), followed by reperfusion of
both arteries for up to 7 days. A small burr hole was made in the
skull to expose the MCA and a metal wire with a diameter of 0.005
inch was placed under the artery. Slight elevation of the metal wire
causes visible occlusion of the MCA. The common carotid artery
was then isolated and occluded using an aneurysm clip. Diminished
blood ﬂow was conﬁrmed with Laser Doppler Perfusion Monitor

(Perimed, North Royalton, OH, USA) and only those animals with a
diminished blood ﬂow of at least 80% and re-establishment of at
least 75% of baseline levels were included in subsequent experimentation.
Preparation of brain lysates
Mice were transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl, and brains were
extracted and homogenized in buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 7.4,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L CaCl2, 0.02% NaN3, 1% Triton-X)
containing protease inhibitors. After centrifugation (17 000 g for
30 min), supernatants were collected and protein concentrations
calculated by bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Thermo-Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA). Protein concentration was adjusted
to 1 mg/mL for all samples before quantiﬁcation of IL-1a levels by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Endothelial cell cultures
Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BECs) from C57BL/6 mice
maintained as cells lines (Sapatino et al. 1993; Clarke et al. 2012),
and the mouse bEnd.5 cell line (which closely resemble primary
brain endothelial cells), were used in this study. C57BL/6 BECs
were cultured on porcine gelatin-coated tissue culture plates (unless
stated otherwise) in Iscove’s Modiﬁed Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 U/mL penicillin,
100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1% L-glutamine, and were kept at
37°C and 5% CO2. bEnd.5 were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed
Eagle medium (high glucose, 4.5 g/L; Invitrogen, Paisley, UK),
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acid, 2 mM
glutamine, 1 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and
were kept at 37°C and 5% CO2.
Cell treatments
Mouse recombinant IL-1a and IL-1b (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA) were diluted in sterile phosphate-buffered saline
containing 0.1% low endotoxin bovine serum albumin (also used
as vehicle control). Cultures were treated with vehicle, IL-1a or IL1b (0.1–00 ng/mL) (based on the known biological activity of IL-1a
(Saini et al. 2011) in the presence or absence of IL-1RA (Lot#
26458 IF; Kineret, Sobi, Inc. Waltham, MA, USA) (10 lg/mL) for
5 h [chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 release], 6 h (for chemotaxis chamber and Tube-like Structure Morphogenesis Assays), or
24 h [for IL-6, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, Cell Count, and Scratch
Assays].
Measurement of CXCL1, IL-1a, and IL-6 release by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Levels of CXCL1, and IL-6 levels in the culture media or IL-1a in
brain lysates were quantiﬁed using DuoSetâ (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) mouse CXCL1/CINC-1, mouse IL-1a, or
mouse IL-6 ELISAs, respectively, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (R&D Systems). The detection limits of the assay were
47 pg/mL for CXCL1, 23 pg/mL for IL-6, and 16 pg/mL for IL-1a.
Levels for all cytokines analyzed were expressed as pg/mL.
Cellular proliferation assay assessed by MTS
BECs were seeded on uncoated tissue culture plates at a density of
10,000 cells/cm2 in 96-well plates in IMDM containing 10% FBS.

cultures, we ﬁrst investigated the effect of recombinant IL-1a
or IL-1b on expression of CXCL1, a chemokine expressed
upon endothelial cell activation and known to play a key role
in recruitment of immune cells into the brain after acute
injury (Losy et al. 2005) and to exert angiogenic actions
(Vries et al. 2015; Wei et al. 2015). Both IL-1a and IL-1b
induced marked increased expression of CXCL1 in BECs,
and increased expression was concentration-dependent for
both ligands (Fig. 2a). Interestingly, optimum concentration
of cytokines that induced maximum CXCL1 expression was
found to be 1 ng/mL for both IL-1a and IL-1b, while
a plateau was reached for the concentrations of 10 and
100 ng/mL. For all the concentrations tested, IL-1a was
more potent than IL-1b at inducing CXCL1 expression, and
this differential expression was signiﬁcant for the concentrations of 1–100 ng/mL. Given these results, all of the
following experiments tested the effect of IL-1a only. IL-1ainduced CXCL1 expression was completely inhibited by
co-incubation with IL-1RA (Fig. 2b), while IL-1RA alone
had no effect (data not shown) demonstrating that these
effects were mediated by the IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1).
Finally, IL-1a induced signiﬁcant release of IL-6 [known to
exert angiogenic actions in brain endothelial cells (Huang
et al. 2004; Gopinathan et al. 2015)] in a concentrationdependent manner, with optimum concentration of IL-1a
found to be 10 ng/mL, while a plateau was reached for the
concentration of 100 ng/mL (Fig. 2c). These results demonstrate that IL-1a is a potent activator of BECs, and since both
CXCL1 and IL-6 have been previously reported to mediate
angiogenesis (Huang et al. 2004; Gopinathan et al. 2015;
Vries et al. 2015; Wei et al. 2015), these results suggest that
IL-1a might trigger angiogenic responses in endothelial cells.

IL-1a increases proliferation of endothelial cells
We next investigated whether IL-1a could affect BEC
proliferation, a known hallmark of endothelial angiogenic
response in vitro, as measured directly by cell counts and
indirectly by MTS assay. Visualization of cultures using
bright-ﬁeld microscopy found that IL-1a triggered cellular
proliferation which was blocked by IL-1RA, but also
demonstrated that no cytotoxicity occurred in response of
any treatments (Fig. 3a). We found that IL-1a (10 ng/mL or
50 ng/mL) increased cellular proliferation compared to
untreated (1% serum control) cultures, which was inhibited
by IL-1RA (Fig. 3b); Quantiﬁcation of cellular proliferation
showed that 10 ng/mL IL-1a signiﬁcantly increased endothelial proliferation by nearly two fold while 50 ng/mL IL-1a
also increased endothelial proliferation, although this was not
signiﬁcant. Cellular proliferation in response to both IL-1a
concentrations tested was signiﬁcantly blocked by IL-1RA.
Interestingly, IL-1RA alone appeared to signiﬁcantly inhibit
basal endothelial proliferation, suggesting that endogenous
IL-1 actions might be involved.
Similarly, we found that IL-1a signiﬁcantly increased
endothelial proliferation compared to vehicle treatment, as
measured by MTS assay (111.0  3.528% for 10 ng/mL,
112.8  4.278% for 50 ng/mL) (Fig. 3c). We also found
that the addition IL-1RA decreased IL-1a-induced endothelial proliferation, while IL-1RA alone had no effect. Collectively, these results indicate that IL-1a increases BEC
proliferation in vitro and did not result in cytotoxicity.

endothelial cells, using scratch and chemotactic migration
assays. In the scratch assay, which measures cell migration
into a ‘scratch’ wound, 10 ng/mL or 50 ng/mL IL-1a
signiﬁcantly increases BEC migration into the wound
(1.70 fold increase for 10 ng/mL and 1.65 fold increase for
50 ng/mL, respectively) (Fig. 4a and b). IL-1RA blocked
IL-1a-induced endothelial cell migration, although this was
only signiﬁcant for the concentration of 10 ng/mL of IL-1a,
while IL-1RA alone had no effect.
In order to conﬁrm the potential effect of IL-1a to induce
chemotactic migration in BECs, we performed chemotaxis
chamber migration assays in which serum-starved cells
migrate toward 1% serum across a porous membrane.
Vehicle treatment triggered a moderate increase in chemotaxic migration of endothelial cells (Fig. 4c). However, IL1a (10 ng/mL and 50 ng/mL) signiﬁcantly increased the
number of cells that migrate compared to 1% serum-directed
controls. Finally, IL-1RA signiﬁcantly blocked the promigratory activity of IL-1a indicating that IL-1a promotes

chemotactic migration of BECs in an IL-1R1-mediated
fashion.
IL-1a promotes formation of capillary tube-like structures
Finally, we investigated whether IL-1a enhances capillary
morphogenesis using the Matrigel assay, another stage of
angiogenesis. Indeed, IL-1a enhanced the formation of
capillary tube-like structures (2.45 fold for 10 ng/mL and
1.44 fold for 50 ng/mL) (Fig. 5). This effect was inhibited by
IL-1RA, while IL-1RA alone had no effect.

Discussion
Angiogenesis is an important component of post-stroke
repair that may aid in the restoration of blood ﬂow to
ischemic brain regions and generate a neurovascular niche to
guide and support neurogenesis (Ohab et al. 2006). In this
study, we found that IL-1a is signiﬁcantly elevated even a
week after experimental stroke. Since IL-1 is an important

inﬂammatory mediator known to trigger post-stroke inﬂammation by acting primarily on endothelial cells (Saini et al.
2011), and IL-1a has been suggested to selectively act on
endothelial cells to exert neuroprotective and pro-angiogenic
effects (Saini and Bix 2012), we investigated the potential of
IL-1a to enhance brain angiogenesis in vitro. Such proangiogenic activity, combined with our observation of
chronic expression of IL-1a after experimental stroke, would
support the hypothesis that IL-1a could be a key driver of
brain post-ischemic injury angiogenesis and thereby represents a novel stroke therapeutic target. Our results demonstrated that IL-1a enhances key stages of angiogenesis,
including endothelial activation, proliferation, migration, and
capillary morphogenesis, and induces important pro-angiogenic mediators (CXCL1 and IL-6) in an IL-1R1-dependent
manner; ﬁrst, we found that IL-1a was chronically elevated
in the stroked brain. Next, we found that both IL-1a and IL1b induced strong activation of endothelial cells, measured
by expression of the chemokine CXCL1, although the effect
of IL-1a was signiﬁcantly higher to that of IL-1b, conﬁrming
the observations of our previous study (Saini et al. 2011) and

that of others (Banks 1999; Fleisher-Berkovich and Danon
1999; Saadi et al. 2000) that IL-1a acts as a selective
activator of endothelial cells. Importantly, although CXCL1
is known for its chemotaxis functions, this chemokine has
been reported to have potent pro-angiogenic actions. Indeed,
CXCL1 is known to induce angiogenesis in peripheral
endothelial cells (Miyake et al. 2013), and the angiogenic
actions of prostaglandin E2 is mediated by CXCL1 in disease
(Wang et al. 2006). Finally, CXCL1 has been reported to
promote angiogenesis by expressing neutrophil-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Wang et al. 2006)
adding to our hypothesis that IL-1a could mediate angiogenesis in the brain. This hypothesis is further supported by
the fact that IL-1a induces strong expression of the cytokine
IL-6, an established pro-angiogenic mediator in the CNS.
Indeed, IL-6 is known to promote post-traumatic repair in the
CNS (Swartz et al. 2001) and induces vasculogenesis of
brain microvessel endothelial cells (Fee et al. 2000). Surprisingly, our data found that while IL-1a induces strong IL6 expression in endothelial cells, it failed to induce
expression of VEGF (data not shown). However, IL-6 is

known to induce expression of VEGF in astrocytes (Loefﬂer
et al. 2005). These observations taken together with our data
suggest that IL-1a could exert pro-angiogenic effects, at least
in part, by inducing IL-6 expression in endothelia, which in
turns may activate neighboring perivascular astrocytes that
produce VEGF to subsequently induce angiogenesis. The
potential signiﬁcance of IL-6 in the pro-angiogenic effects of
IL-1a is actively being investigated.
In further support of our hypothesis that IL-1a has proangiogenic actions on brain endothelial cells, we found that
IL-1a induced strong BEC proliferation and migration, and
promoted formation of tube-like structures, which are key
features of angiogenesis and established angiogenic assay
in vitro. Interestingly, in our BEC migration experiments, we
noted that IL-1a both stimulated migration into a scratch
wound and acted as a migration chemotactant, which let us
speculate that IL-1a expressed after ischemic injury by periinfarct astrocytes, microglia, and other endothelial cells
(Saini et al. 2011), like other angiogenic/chemotactant
factors such as VEGF and angiopoietin, attracts migrating/
angiogenic endothelial cells. Additionally, we found that IL1R1 blockade with IL-1RA in the absence of IL-1a was
sufﬁcient to blunt some baseline angiogenic responses
(proliferation and migration), suggesting that endogenously
generated IL-1a may exert some angiogenic effects, further
supporting the role of IL-1a in brain angiogenesis.
While our data suggest that CXCL1 and IL-6 could
mediate IL-1a-induced angiogenesis, other mediators might
also be involved. Indeed, one possibility is that IL-1a
enhances angiogenesis via causing brain endothelial cells to
generate the pro-angiogenic extracellular matrix fragment
perlecan LG3, as we have demonstrated in our previous

studies (Saini et al. 2011). In the same study, we demonstrated that IL-1b did not exert this effect and in contrast,
decreased LG3 levels below baseline levels (Saini et al.
2011; Clarke et al. 2012), further distinguishing the selective
effects IL-1a on brain endothelial cells. Current studies to
ascertain the mechanism(s) by which IL-1a generates LG3
and whether this could be responsible, at least in part, for its
angiogenic effects, are ongoing.
Another important caveat to this study is that it was
performed almost entirely in vitro using murine rather human
cells and cell lines rather than primary cells. The potential
role of IL-1a in brain angiogenesis in vivo is currently under
investigation in our laboratory. Furthermore, while this study
demonstrates that IL-1a promotes brain angiogenesis in vitro
under normal conditions (normoxia and normoglycemia),
further studies are necessary to determine the experimental
and therapeutic relevance of IL-1a as a key driver of brain
angiogenesis after ischemic injury. For example, IL-1a dose–
response and variable dosing schedule studies in experimental stroke could be performed to determine IL-1a‘s safety and
(angiogenic) therapeutic efﬁcacy. Furthermore, while IL1RA is currently being considered as an anti-inﬂammatory
therapeutic approach targeting the detrimental acute phase of
inﬂammation (Pradillo et al. 2012), our results highlight the
possibility that sustained IL-1a levels might be important to
promote key repair mechanisms including angiogenesis.
Indeed, our study suggests that reﬁned IL-1RA administration (time window and amount to be administered) might be
necessary or that selective inhibition of IL-1b to favor the
potentially more beneﬁcial effects of IL-1a could be
achieved by co-administering IL-1RA followed by chronic
low IL-1a regimens.

In summary, this study demonstrates that the inﬂammatory
cytokine IL-1a enhances several stages of brain angiogenesis
in vitro in a receptor-mediated fashion. This novel observation adds further support to the idea that inﬂammatory signals
in the brain, such as those that occur after stroke, may exert
beneﬁcial effects that could be therapeutically exploited.
