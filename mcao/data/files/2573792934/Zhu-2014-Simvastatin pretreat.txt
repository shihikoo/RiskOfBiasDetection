Abstract Excitotoxicity and cytotoxic edema are the two
major factors resulting in neuronal injury during brain ischemia and reperfusion. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II), the downstream signal molecular of Nmethyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), is a mediator in the
excitotoxicity. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), expressed mainly in the
brain, is an important aquaporin to control the flux of water. In
a previous study, we had reported that pretreatment of simvastatin protected the cerebrum from ischemia and reperfusion
injury by decreasing neurological deficit score and infarct area
(Zhu et al. PLoS One 7:e51552, 2012). The present study used
a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model to further
explore the pleiotropic effect of simvastatin via CaMK II and
AQP4. The results showed that simvastatin reduced
degenerated cells and brain edema while decreasing the protein expressions of phosphor-CaMK II and AQP4, and increasing the ratios of Bcl-2/Bax, which was independent of
cholesterol-lowering effect. Immunocomplexes formed between the subunit of NMDARs-NR3A and AQP4 were detected for the first time. It was concluded that simvastatin
could protect the cerebrum from neuronal excitotoxicity and
cytotoxic edema by downregulating the expressions of
phosphor-CaMK II and AQP4, and that the interaction between NR3A and AQP4 might provide the base for AQP4
involving in the signaling pathways mediated by NMDARs.

Introduction
The overload of Ca2+ induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) overactivation and then excitotoxicity along
with the increased production of glutamate is the main cause
of neuronal injury in brain ischemia and reperfusion. The
influx of Ca2+ can activate significantly the downstream signaling pathways, including various protein kinases (Pundik
et al. 2012; Szydlowska and Tymianski 2010). Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II), widely distributed in the body, but expressed predominantly in the brain, is
involved in the regulation of neuronal functions such as neurotransmitter synthesis, neurotransmitter release, modulation
of ion channel activity, cellular transport, synaptic plasticity,
long-term potentiation, learning, and memory (Hudmon and
Schulman 2002). A great increase in intracellular calcium,
resulting from influx through NMDARs, was reported to lead
to the continuous activation of CaMK II through autophosphorylation of threonine site 286 (Thr286) (Colbran et al.
1989a, b; Fukunaga and Miyamoto 2000; Miller et al.

1988). Previous studies have demonstrated that the phosphorylation of CaMK II in the hippocampal region may play an
important role in regulating neurotoxic responses (Hudmon
and Schulman 2002; Lee et al. 2003; Yamauchi 2005).
It was reported that brain edema, a serious complication of
stroke, significantly affected morbidity and mortality following stroke and other forms of ischemic brain injury (Balami
et al. 2011). A large amount of glutamate resulted in overstimulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), kainate receptors (KARs), and NMDARs on neurons, with a consequent
influx of Na+ and Ca2+ through the channels gated by these
receptors; thus, water follows passively the ion influx, hence,
cytotoxic edema (Kostandy 2011). Aquaporins, a family of
water-channel proteins, provide a major pathway for osmotically driven water transport through cell membrane. So far, 13
aquaporin isoforms (AQP0–AQP12) have been identified in
mammalian species (Verkman 2005), of which AQP4 monomer is 28 kDa, with a water pore produced by six membranespanning domains (Saadoun and Papadopoulos 2010), which
is mainly expressed in astrocyte foot processes throughout the
central nervous system, including the cerebellum, supraoptic
and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, neocortex,
hippocampal dentate gyrus, hippocampal areas CA1–CA3,
nucleus of stria terminalis, and medial habenular nucleus
(Jung et al. 1994; Venero et al. 1999); therefore, AQP4 is
likely to be capable of controlling water fluxes into and out of
the brain parenchyma (Papadopoulos and Verkman 2007).
Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase inhibitors, are potent cholesterol-lowering drugs
and attractive for its protective effects on ischemic stroke in
recent years; although abundant experimental evidences and
clinical trials have been developed, the molecular mechanisms
underlying statins-induced benefits are still represented by the
lipid profile improvement and anti-inflammatory effects, the
definite and detailed molecular mechanisms need to be further
studied (Montecucco et al. 2012; Prinz and Endres 2011;
Rodriguez-Yanez et al. 2008). In the previous study, we had
reported that simvastatin pretreatment protected cerebrum from
brain ischemia and reperfusion injury via upregulation of PP2A
and NR3A, thus dephosphorylating NR1 (Serine 896 (Ser896),
Ser897) to alleviate excitotoxicity (Zhu et al. 2012). Based on
such preliminary data, the aim of the present study was to
demonstrate the role of CaMK II and AQP4 in the pleiotropic
effect of simvastatin.

maintained at the controlled temperature of 25 °C with 12/12
light/dark cycle, during which they were allowed to have free
access to food and water. The animals were randomly divided
into four groups: sham, middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO), vehicle + MCAO, and simvastatin (sim) + MCAO
group. Simvastatin (Merck, NJ, USA) was dissolved in normal saline as a vehicle, and a single dose of simvastatin
20 mg/kg or vehicle was daily gavaged for 7 days until
transient right hemisphere MCAO. Under chloral hydrate
(350 mg/kg) anesthesia, the occlusion was ensured for 1 h
by inserting a 4–0 surgical nylon of 18.5–19.5 mm with its tip
rounded by heat from the external carotid artery into the
internal carotid artery until it reached the origin of the middle
cerebral artery (Longa et al. 1989). The body temperature of
animals was controlled with a thermistor-guided heating pad,
with the thermistor probe placed into the rectum, and kept at
37 °C during the whole operation. At the end of MCAO, the
suture was withdrawn for 24-h reperfusion.
All procedures were performed according to protocols and
guidelines approved by the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH
Publications no. 80–23, 1996), and approved by the Ethics
Committee for Experimental Research of School of Basic
Medical Sciences, Fudan University.

Histological Staining

Animals and Treatments

After 1-h occlusion and 24-h reperfusion, the rats were anesthetized to be perfused through the ascending aorta with
200 ml of heparinized saline, followed by an addition of
200 ml of freshly prepared 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M

Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 210–220 g were
obtained from the Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center to be

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Scanning
After 1-h occlusion and 24-h reperfusion, the rats were anesthetized and placed in the prone position for MRI scanning, and
Siemens Avanto 1.5T MR scanner and special head coil were
applied to the rats. T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) was performed
in one axial slice covering the brain with repetition time (TR) of
2,500 ms, echo time (TE) of 64 ms, and slice thickness of
1.5 mm. According to the atlas of Watson and Paxinos (2007),
the hippocampus was treated as the target region.
Bain Water Content (BWC) Measurement
BWC was measured based on wet-dry weight ratio. After 1-h
occlusion and 24-h reperfusion, the rat was anesthetized, and
the whole brain was quickly removed and dissected into
ischemic and contralateral hemispheres, which were immediately weighed for wet weight and then dried in a vacuum oven
at 120 °C for 3 days. The dried brain was reweighed for dry
weight; BWC was determined as a result of the formula: (wet
weight−dry weight)/wet weight×100 %.

of phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Afterwards, the
brain was removed from the skull and post-fixed at 4 °C
overnight. Next, the fixed brain was placed in 20 % sucrose
at 4 °C until it sank to the bottom. Afterwards, the brain was
placed in 30 % sucrose at 4 °C until it sank to the bottom. The
hippocampus CA1 was located at 2.4 mm posterior to the
bregma according to the atlas of Watson and Paxinos (2007).
Coronal sections of the brain tissues (15 μm) were sliced and
stained with hematoxylin–eosin (HE; Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Haimen, China) or Nissl (cresyl violet;
Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China). All of
images were captured with Leica DMIRB microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
Quantitative Analysis of Apoptotic Cells
Fluorescent DNA binding dyes Hoechst 33258 was used to
define nuclear chromatin morphology as a quantitative index
of apoptosis as described previously (Li et al. 2012). The
tissue sections were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) in the dark for
10 min, then the slides were rinsed in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4) for
three times, and mounted with mounting medium. The nuclear
morphology was examined by fluorescence microscopy
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), and cells were
scored as apoptotic if they exhibited unequivocal nuclear
chromatin condensation and/or fragmentation. Five sections
per group (one section each animal) and three continual fields
(×400) of the hippocampus CA1 in each section were utilized
for quantitative analysis with Image Pro-plus 6.0 (Media
Cybernetics, Sliver Spring, MD, USA). The mean values were
expressed as the percentage of apoptotic cell per field.
Determination of Cholesterol in Serum
The rats were gavaged with simvastatin (20 mg/kg) or normal
saline (as vehicle) for 7 days and then deeply anesthetized for
drawing the blood from the eyeball; the serum was separated
from the blood by centrifugation at 4 °C and 3,500 rpm for
10 min. The concentrations of free cholesterol, cholesteryl ester,
and total cholesterol in serum were measured with cholesterol/
cholesteryl ester quantitation colorimetric kit (Biovision, CA,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was performed before
the proteins were transferred to the poly-vinylidene fluoride
(PVDF) membranes (Millipore, MA, USA), which were
blocked with 5 % non-fat milk, washed in Tris-buffered saline
containing 0.1 % Tween-20 (TBST), and incubated with
primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies
were as follows: mouse anti-CaMK II monoclonal antibody
(1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-CaMK II alpha
(phospho T286) polyclonal antibody (1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-AQP4 polyclonal antibody (1:1,000;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), and mouse anti-βactin polyclonal antibody (1:3,000; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China). Peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit (1:1,000; Millipore, MA, USA) and anti-mouse
(1:3,000; Millipore, MA, USA) antibodies were used as the
secondary antibody. The membranes were probed using an
ECL-Plus detection kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology,
Haimen, China) and then scanned with Imagequant LAS4000
mini (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, CT, USA). The intensity
analysis was performed using Gel-Pro Analyzer (FURI Science & Technology, Shanghai, China).
Co-immunoprecipitation
The tissue samples of the hippocampus CA1 from normal
rats were homogenized in NP-40 lysis buffer (Beyotime
Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) with protease
and phosphatase inhibitor, the total protein concentration
measured by BCA assay. According to the protocol of
immunoprecipitation kit Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen,
Oslo, Norway), 50 μl of protein G Dynabeads were
incubated with 1–10 μg of antibody with rotation at room
temperature for 10 min. They were washed three times,
followed by an addition of 100 μl of tissue sample for
another 10-min rotation. Then, the complex was washed
three times and eluted with elution buffer. Goat antiNR3A polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
CA, USA) and rabbit anti-AQP4 polyclonal antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) were adopted for coimmunoprecipitation. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat (1:1,000;
Millipore, MA, USA) and anti-rabbit (1:1,000; Millipore, MA,
USA) antibodies were used as the secondary antibody.
Statistical Analysis

Western Blot Analysis
After 1-h occlusion and 24-h reperfusion, the rats were decapitated to collect their brains. The tissue samples of the hippocampus CA1 were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer
(Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) with
protease and phosphatase inhibitor, the total protein concentration measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Total
protein (50 μg) was loaded into each lane onto 10 % SDS-

The data were expressed as the mean±SEM. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA for multiple
comparisons. If the variances were homogeneous, the least
significant difference (LSD) test was used. For data sets with
non-homogeneous variances, the ANOVA test with Dunnett’s
T3 analysis was applied. Paired Student’s t test was applied in
comparison between vehicle and sim 20 mg/kg group. P
values less than 0.05 were considered significant in all cases.

directly reveals a unique alteration in brain water. From the
results, T2WI signal intensity increased significantly in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the ischemic hemisphere at the
24th hour after MCAO, and the brain midline was deviated to the
contralateral side. MRI data indicated that ongoing cellular swelling and edema formation were present at the point of time. As

compared with the MCAO group, the T2WI signal intensity
decreased in the sim + MCAO group (Fig. 1a).
To evaluate the degree of cerebral edema, brain water
content, as measured by wet-dry weight ratio, was adopted
in this study. BWC of the ischemic hemisphere in the sham
group was measured to be 78.3±0.12 %, and in the sim +
MCAO group, 80.17±0.19 %, which was found to decrease
when compared with that in the MCAO group (82.92±
0.59 %, P<0.05). However, no significant difference of
BWC was observed in the contralateral hemisphere (Fig. 1b).

morphology in the sham group. In the vehicle + MCAO group,
many neurons were found to show shrunken nucleus and cytoplasmic vacuolation. Administration of simvastatin reduced the
number of degenerated neurons and significantly increased that
of intact neurons (Fig. 2).

To further examine the possible mechanism of brain ischemia and reperfusion-induced apoptosis and the effect of simvastatin on it, we tested the protein expressions of Bcl-2 (an
apoptosis inhibitor) and Bax (an apoptosis promoter). Western

the MCAO group (0.82±0.04, P<0.05) in comparison with

to be located in the spinal dorsal horn as well as in the

Effect of Simvastatin on Serum Cholesterol Concentration
HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, and statins are the potent reversible
inhibitor of it. With regard to this, we detected the cholesterollowering effect of simvastatin on normal rats after administration of normal saline (as vehicle) or simvastatin (20 mg/kg/
day) for 7 days. In the vehicle and simvastatin group, respectively, the concentrations of free cholesterol (μg/μl) were 0.21
±0.01 and 0.20±0.01; those of cholesteryl ester (μg/μl), 0.49
±0.05 and 0.47±0.02; and those of total cholesterol (μg/μl),
0.70±0.06 and 0.67±0.02. From the results, it was found that
the three forms of cholesterol were lower in the simvastatin
than in the vehicle group, while the difference showed no
significance (Fig. 5).
Co-immunoprecipitation Between NR3A and AQP4
in Hippocampus CA1 Region of Normal Rats
Co-immunoprecipitation has become the method of choice for
identifying protein–protein interactions. In this study, coimmunoprecipitation performed with normal rats showed positive bands between NR3A and AQP4 suggesting they
interacted with each other (Fig. 6).

Discussion
CaMK II and Brain Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury
The activation of CaMK II by Ca2+/CaM has been reported to
cause intramolecular autophosphorylation at several sites, including Thr286, Thr305, and Thr306, and autophosphorylation of Thr286 in CaMK II to generate autonomous or Ca2+independent activity that persists even after dissociation of
Ca2+/CaM and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations return to the
basal levels (Kasahara et al. 1999; Wayman et al. 2011). The
activation of CaMK II would subsequently activate the Fasmediated signal transduction cascade to induce apoptosis
(Wright et al. 1997; Yang et al. 2003). But the Ca2+-independent activity of CaMK II could be reversed by dephosphorylating CaMK II with protein phosphatases, including protein
phosphatases 1, 2A, and 2C (Colbran et al. 1989a; Hwang
et al. 1996; Kasahara et al. 1999).
Hypoxia could increase the enzyme activity of CaMK II in
PC-12 cells (Premkumar et al. 2000). When NMDA was
applied to the cultured hippocampal neurons, the phosphorylation of Thr286 on CaMK II was found to increase (Tao-

increased significantly, and the ratios of Bcl-2/Bax decreased,
where the morphology of the hippocampal neurons showed an
increase in the number of the degenerated and apoptotic cells,
while the administration of simvastatin reversed these changes. These effects may have been ensured by upregulating the
expression and enzymatic activity of PP2A, as demonstrated
by our previous study (Zhu et al. 2012).

levels of AQP4. As indicated by MRI and BWC, the edema
increased significantly to be 82.9 % in the MCAO group, and
meanwhile, the protein level of AQP4 increased in the hippocampus of the MCAO group. However, the administration of
simvastatin relieved brain edema, decreasing AQP4 expression, which may protect the cerebrum from brain ischemia and
reperfusion injury.

AQP4 and Brain Ischemia and Reperfusion Injury

The Cholesterol-Independent Effect of Simvastatin

Brain edema is divided into two categories: cytotoxic edema
resulting from disturbances in cell metabolism without a disruption of the blood–brain barriers (BBB) and vasogenic
edema caused by a breakdown of BBB into macromolecules
(Taniguchi et al. 2000). Previous studies have indicated that
the cytotoxic edema occurs followed by the vasogenic edema
in post ischemic brain edema (Badaut et al. 2007; Taniguchi
et al. 2000). AQP4 was reported to be important in the
pathophysiology of cytotoxic and vasogenic brain edema,
although it played opposing roles, and AQP4 facilitated edema fluid formation in early cytotoxic edema, but increased the
rate of edema fluid elimination in vasogenic brain edema
(Papadopoulos and Verkman 2007).
In AQP4 null mice following MCAO, reduced brain edema
and improved neurological outcomes were seen relative to
wild-type mice (Saadoun and Papadopoulos 2010). In adult
rats, AQP4 mRNA was upregulated until the 7th day after
MCAO, with a significant increase on day 3 in both the
ischemic core and border region, which was correlated with
brain swelling, suggesting that AQP4 could be a major water
channel in water movements following MCAO and that the
regulation of AQP4 expression could be a potential therapeutic target (Taniguchi et al. 2000; Yang et al. 2009). AQP4 was
also upregulated in the astrocytes of the ischemic focus and
periphery areas of the human brain with cerebral infarction
(Aoki et al. 2003).
MCAO model of 1-h occlusion and 24-h reperfusion
belonged to cytotoxic edema (Badaut et al. 2007; Yang et al.
1992), in which the present study detected BWC and protein

For the primary pharmacological action of simvastatin, the
protective effect of simvastatin on ischemic stroke has been
supposedly partly related to its cholesterol-lowering effect
(Ponce et al. 2008; Zacco et al. 2003). But from the present
results, under simvastatin 20 mg/kg for 7 days, the
reduction of free cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, and total
cholesterol was not significant in the simvastatin group
when compared with the control; however, the protective effect of the drug to improve neuronal injury and
edema was remarkable, so it can be inferred that the
effect of simvastatin on ischemic stroke was independent of its cholesterol-lowering effect.

The Interrelation Between NR3A and AQP4
Sproul et al. (2011) reported for the first time in 2011 that
NR3A expressed strongly in the neonatal mouse kidney, and
its presence drastically diminished over a relatively short time
following birth, with the same characteristic expression both
in the kidney and brain. In addition, they showed that total
AQP2 protein levels in the outer and inner medulla decreased
significantly in NR3A knockout mice. Such intriguing findings were related to the present study where we detected that
NR3A could interact with AQP4 in the hippocampus of the
normal rats, which suggested that AQP4 can be as a downstream molecular to participate in the signaling pathways
mediated by NMDARs, and the regulative mechanism between NR3A and AQP4 in neural system needs further
investigations.

In conclusion, simvastatin pretreatment could protect the
cerebrum from neuronal injury and cytotoxic edema by decreasing the expression of phosphor-CaMK II and AQP4,
which is independent of cholesterol-lowering effect; moreover, NR3A can interact with AQP4 to form an
immunocomplex. The present study presented a new insight
into the pleiotropic effect of simvastatin on brain ischemia and
reperfusion injury, and provided a base for further investigations on the signal transmission between NMDARs and
AQP4.
