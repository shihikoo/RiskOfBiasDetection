Abstract
Background/Aim: A longer period of vessel occlusion reduces the coefficient of variation of the infarct lesion size [‘infarct
variation coefficient’ (IVC)] due to a gradual expansion of the
lesion within a limited territory defined by the vascular anatomy, but it increases the mortality rate. A crucial issue in the
induction of experimental focal cerebral ischemia has been
to achieve a low IVC value and a low mortality rate. We
attempted to improve IVC and mortality using the 3-vessel
occlusion model. Methods: We introduced a new, transtemporal fascia approach to expose the zygomatic arch, in
which the fascia of the temporal muscle is cut and retracted
dorsally together with the facial nerve and the vein en bloc.
Results/Conclusion: The approach avoided traumatic
venous bleeding around the zygomatic arch. We established
a bloodless model of focal ischemia that can produce a
consistent degree of reduction in the regional cerebral blood
flow within the ischemic penumbra. The model, charac-

Introduction

Current knowledge on the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke is largely based on research utilizing animal
models of transient, focal cerebral ischemia that mimic
ischemic stroke induced by the occlusion of the middle
cerebral artery (MCA) with rich collateral anastomosis,
mostly combined with simultaneous, tandem, or multiple
occlusion of cerebral arteries [1]. Focal ischemia models
have played an important role in understanding the
pathophysiology of cerebral infarction, but existing mod-

been postulated that the recurrent peri-infarct depolarization observed on measurement of the direct current
potential, with subsequent reduction in the rCBF, is the
principal cause of gradual tissue damage in the penumbra
[13].
In humans, an rCBF ≥19 ml/100 g/min, or ≥32% of
preischemic control values, maintains normal cerebral
function [18]. Irrespective of species differences, a reduction below 15–19 ml/100 g/min, or <25–32% rCBF of preischemic control values, generates functional impairment
(i.e. electrical silence on EEG) [7, 11, 19]. More severe
ischemia, below the lower threshold of 6 ml/100 g/min
rCBF, or <10% rCBF of preischemic control values, causes
immediate persistent depolarization, complete energy
failure, and cell death [7, 11, 18, 19]. In spontaneously
hypertensive rats, however, persistent ischemic depolarization was observed in a region where it was <50 ml/
100 g/min, or 38 ± 13 ml/100 g/min on average [20], and
cerebral infarction developed in a region where there was
<50 ml/100 g/min rCBF [21]. Thus, the threshold for the
induction of cerebral infarction is not always the same,
but it is affected by individual vascular pathophysiology
such as chronic hypertension.
In a study of positron emission tomography performed
several hours after the onset of ischemic stroke, tissue
with an rCBF <12 ml/100 g/min, or <20% rCBF of preischemic control values, became infarcted on later computed tomography [9]. However, when thrombolytic reperfusion therapy was successful in the acute phase, it was
possible to salvage 77.3% of the gray matter at risk, in
which the initial rCBF (measured within 3 h after the ictus, before a therapeutic intervention) was <12 ml/100 g/
min, or <20% [9]. Taken together, an rCBF <20% was
found to cause irreversible tissue damage in a short period of time (within a few hours), but was not the threshold that caused terminal depolarization, leading to immediate cell death.
Any animal model that is used to evaluate the degree
of cerebral damage due to focal ischemia must induce a
critical but treatable area – the ischemic penumbra – between the upper and lower thresholds of 10 and 32% of
the rCBF at least for a certain period, and any neuroprotective intervention must be initiated within the limits of
viability of neurons in this area [7, 11, 18]. Because the
basal ganglia are not protected by a system of vascular reserve, severe ischemia, rCBF <10%, occurs after obstruction of the MCA involving the lenticulostriate arteries
[19]. Belayev et al. [22], by analyzing topographic hemodynamics in the ischemic region induced by the method
of intraluminal thread insertion (ITI) in rats in which the

els have limited reliability for evaluating neuroprotective
interventions as many favorable results obtained in animal models have not been translated into human clinical
studies [2–6].
Focal cerebral ischemia, excluding the lacunar type,
occurs due to simultaneous multiple vessel occlusion,
with or without preexisting occlusion or stenosis, causing
a significant reduction of regional blood flow (rCBF) below a critical level. Developmentally rich collateral anastomoses exist throughout the brain, including the neocortex; this is the cerebrovascular reserve system, a potent
mechanism for the rescue of brain tissue from critical reductions of rCBF, comprising multiple feeding arteries
that increase blood supply to ischemic territories. Electrophysiological dysfunction is regarded as a key event in
the pathogenesis of ischemic brain injury. A reduction in
rCBF below 15–18 ml/100 g/min was found to cause immediate electrical dysfunction of neurons (expressed as
electrical silence), as observed by flattening of the EEG or
abolition of somatosensory-evoked potentials in cats, baboons, and humans [7–9]. That portion of the brain below the threshold for complete electrical silence on EEG
(reversible depolarization), but above the threshold for
complete energy failure (persistent or terminal depolarization), is referred to as the ischemic penumbra [7–9].
Persistent or terminal depolarization in the ischemic core
triggers repeated ripple-like spreading depolarization
that spreads to the surrounding structures, referred to as
peri-infarct depolarization, which causes transient reductions in rCBF and transient or persistent depression of
electrical activity (electrical silence on EEG) [10–14]. Importantly, the peri-infarct depolarization phenomenon
propagates not only in the penumbra, but also to the
healthy surrounding structures, causing transient electrical silence on EEG accompanied by arterial constriction
or dilatation [13].
The state in which there is reduced rCBF but where a
normal cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen is maintained
by increased the oxygen extraction fraction with compensatory dilatation of collateral arteries is referred to as misery perfusion, or stage 2 [15]. Although energy metabolism is preserved both in the area of misery perfusion and
the ischemic penumbra, extended tissue viability is maintained only in the area of misery perfusion, at least for
more than a few hours without any intervention [16, 17].
In a review article, Hossmann [16] redefined the concept
of the ischemic penumbra as a region of constrained
blood supply with preserved energy metabolism, and noted that the region would be infarcted within a few hours
by the peri-infarct depolarization phenomenon. It has

ITI model, versus 22% in the 3-VO model (p = 0.026, t
test, n = 19 in each model) [29]. In addition to the difference in vascular reserve between the basal ganglia and the
cortex, abundant neurons in the striatum are highly vulnerable to ischemia [31, 32]. Such inconsistent vulnerability of neurons in the basal ganglia is also a factor that
contributes to an increase in the IVC value.
The mortality rate is not always reported in the ITI
model, but has been reported to be 71% at 24 h after 2-hour
ischemia in rats [33]. The fact that all animals died within
32 h after the induction of ischemia in the original ITI report [24] demonstrates that thread insertion into the cerebral artery is not ‘less invasive’ compared to open surgery.
In the case of human intravascular intervention, the use of
systemic heparin and a heparin-coated catheter are essential to prevent blood coagulation in and around the catheter, as well as subsequent thrombus/embolism formation.
The insertion of a nonheparinized nylon thread, i.e. a
biologically active (foreign) substance sitting in the arterial lumen for a prolonged period (≥30 min), activates the
blood coagulation system, resulting in multiple uncontrollable embolisms [34–36]. When the ITI technique was
applied to C57 BL/6 mice, the mortality rate was 17–37%
at 24 h after 60-min ischemia [37], and 25–80% at 48 h
after 30- to 60-min ischemia [38]. However, information
on acute death is often not provided in descriptions of the
ITI model [39–41]. We speculate that failure to disclose
(or lack of recognition of the importance of disclosing)
the number of excluded animals in each group after the
insertion of the thread (or the total number of animals in
each group at entry) is the primary reason for difficulties
related to poor interlab comparability in the ITI model.
While it has become increasingly apparent that transparent reporting of individual criteria and prior incorporation of such criteria into the protocol are essential, few
papers fulfill these requirements [42].
A model of focal ischemia that removes or minimizes
the need for animal exclusion during and after ischemia
is expected to preclude observation bias and reporting of
false positive results. Among the strategies to induce focal
ischemia, the 3-VO method sufficiently suppresses the
compensatory effect of the cerebrovascular reserve system. We found that temporary occlusion of both CCAs in
conjunction with permanent unilateral occlusion of an
MCA consistently produces focal ischemia, rCBF that is
>10% but <20%, and adequate reperfusion in the cortex,
achieving good reproducibility for the homogeneous development of cortical infarction [29]. However, removal
of the zygomatic arch to open a burr hole carries a risk of
venous bleeding that might increase IVC values.

coefficient of variation of the size of the infarct [‘infarct
variation coefficient’ (IVC), i.e. percent of standard deviation (SD) of the mean infarct lesion volume] was 8%
(n = 5/group), defined the region where rCBF is reduced
to 20–40% of control (contralateral) values as the ‘penumbra’, and the more ischemic region with <20% of control rCBF, which contributed 70% of the infarcted lesion,
as the ‘core’. However, glucose metabolism in the penumbra was normal at the end of ITI-induced 2-hour ischemia [22, 23], indicating that the degree of reduction in
rCBF was not sufficient to induce irreversible tissue damage within 2 h in rats (i.e. 12 h in humans, as described in
the Discussion). Although the reason is unknown, glucose metabolism in the penumbra, which was normal at
the end of ischemia, decreased by 40–60% 1 h after circulation was reestablished (induced by thread removal)
[23].
The various models of focal ischemia each have their
advantages and disadvantages, with associated error rates
at which no infarction or fatal ischemia occur. The ITI
method, utilized worldwide [24–28], involves insertion of
a nylon thread from the common (CCA) or external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery, with the objective of occluding the orifice of the ipsilateral MCA in a
blind manner.
Insertion of the thread causes simultaneous tandem
occlusion or stenosis involving the ipsilateral ICA, with
or without the ipsilateral anterior cerebral artery, posterior communicating artery, and posterior cerebral artery.
While the ITI method does not require a burr hole and
intracranial surgery, the level of reduction in rCBF varies
because of slight differences in individual vasculature and
the contribution of the coagulation system and normal
cerebrovascular reserve system. The size of the ischemic
lesion varies widely [29], producing a subgroup of animals with no/faint and huge/fatal infarction. The ITI
model is associated with substantial variability in the coefficient of variation of the size of the infarct (IVC), ranging from 5 to 200% [1]. Due to the expandable IVCs,
many studies with low IVCs have used individual (laboratory-specific) animal exclusion criteria that are applied
after the insertion of the thread.
A review of the absolute values of lesion sizes obtained
by protocols using the ITI method described in the literature revealed a great variability in IVC that ranged from
5 to 102% (n = 19); a range almost 2 times wider than that
of the 3-vessel occlusion (3-VO) method, which has been
found to have a range in variability from 13 to 52% (n =
19) [29, 30]. After temporary focal ischemia for 2–3 h,
there was a significant difference in the IVCs: 34% in the

To improve the quality of preclinical assessment and
reproducibility of data, we developed a model of focal
ischemia that has a lower IVC value and lower mortality
in the acute phase. Here, we demonstrate techniques that
involve sharp dissection, including a detailed description
of the transtemporal muscle (fascia) approach, with the
use of multiple figures and an online supplementary
video (for all online supplementary material, see www.
karger.com/doi/10.1159/000356048) that facilitates the
training of researchers who have not tried or succeeded
in implementing the 3-VO model. This bloodless surgery
resulted in a brief ischemic time, a short skin-to-skin
time, and a low IVC value, with low mortality.

Induction of Temporary Focal Ischemia
Preparation for Surgery
Induce anesthesia by applying a mixture of 1.0–1.5% halothane
in oxygen and nitrogen. Lower the concentration of halothane
between 0.2 and 1.0% during operation. Note: observe the vital
signs at all times point during the operation. Adjust the depth
of anesthesia (deep or shallow) according to painful or painless
procedures and time. Identify and solve emerging issues
promptly if body temperature, blood pressure, or heart rate becomes abnormal, so as to ensure smooth and regular spontaneous respiration and uniform anesthesia, as well as minimize
differences among individuals and increase comparability.
Suture the left eyelids to protect the eyeball from craniofacial
surgery. Shave hair around the left zygomatic and frontal neck
area widely with razor blade with 70% alcohol. Note: avoid hypothermia during hair shaving by minimizing use of alcohol.
Monitor the heart rate, systemic and diastolic blood pressure
via the proximal tail artery. To avoid the use of a muscle relaxant that suppresses the respiratory function, careful adjustments of halothane concentration are needed by monitoring
spontaneous respiration and the physiologic parameters.
Regulate rectal (core) temperature at the range, 37 ± 0.5 ° C, by
means of a heating lamp and the body temperature controller
with a heating table and a thermometer before (5 min), during
(0, 5, 10, 15 min) and after surgery (15 min).
Exposure of the CCAs for the preparation of 3-VO.
In a supine position, make a midline incision at the front neck,
lift up the fat tissue and the thyroid gland rostrally, and expose
both CCAs (fig. 1: 1–4).

Induction of 3-VO
• Place the head in the right lateral position, keeping the lower
body trunk in a supine position, and incise skin horizontally
along the left zygomatic arch to expose the fascia of the temporal muscle underneath (fig. 1a–d).
• After exposing the fascia of the left temporal muscle, cut the fascia along the ventral edge of the zygomatico-orbital branch of
the facial nerve that is running on the fascia along the zygomatic arch horizontally (fig. 1e, f). Retract the nerve together with
the orbitozygomatic vein that runs dorsoparallel to the nerve,
cut the muscle under the fascia horizontally, and expose the surfaces of the zygomatic bone (fig. 1g–j). This transtemporal fascia
approach can avoid damage to the orbitozygomatic vein, and
occlusion-induced delayed venous bleeding. Open the capsule
of the temporomandibular joint (temporomandibular articulation) (fig. 1k). After cutting the sphenomandibular ligament, cut
and remove the zygomatic arch with the rongeur (fig. 1l–o), paying attention not to damage the external jugular vein running at
the right corner in the surgical window. Note: in this step, avoid
tear injuries to the veins by the sharp tips of the microforceps.

• Retract the mandible bone ventrally, and expose the left temporal bone (fig. 1p). Note: the view of the temporal bone can be
maintained by hand-made rectangular needle retractors. Installation, traction, and removal of the retractors should be performed carefully to prevent vice-associated injury of the muscle
or venous tissue.
• Drill a 1-mm diameter burr hole at a point 2 mm superior and
rostral to the foramen ovale, at the location of nerve impression
on the temporal bone by the extracranial trigeminal nerve root
(fig. 1q–t). Through the drilled burr hole, the left MCA (red)
and the lateral edge of the left olfactory tract (white) are seen.
Note: drill the skull until the internal plate of the skull cracks,
leading to simultaneously tearing of the dura mater and a small
amount of cerebrospinal fluid leakage.
• Remove the cracked bone pieces with microsurgical forceps
and expose the left MCA (fig. 1u, v). Note: in the removal of the
bone pieces, hold the pieces away from the MCA trunk to avoid
damage to the MCA.
• Cauterize the MCA using a bipolar coagulator at the lateral
edge of the olfactory tract, with the output power around 0.2–
0.3 (fig. 1w, x). After the cauterization, cut the MCA with microscissors permanently (fig.  1y, z). Note: wash the surgical
field with 20% mannitol before electrocoagulation of the MCA
to prevent char from forming on the tips of the bipolar forceps
[43]. The MCA may stick to the surface of the forceps during
the char formation and bleed.
• Immediately after the permanent obstruction of the MCA, clipocclude the right CCA just proximal to the bifurcation, which
completes the 3-VO (fig. 1: ①–④). After the induction of focal

• After the exposure of CCAs (fig. 1: 4–13), occlude the left CCA
at the location just proximal to the CCA bifurcation using a
microclip (fig. 1: 14–15). The temporary occlusion of the left
CCA prior to the MCA is beneficial to reduce the volume of the
vascular bed during the procedure in the left face. Note: when
exposing the CCAs, always dissect and separate the connective
tissues, avoiding pinching of the muscles, nerves, veins, and

Evaluation of Neurological Deficits
The functional consequences caused by the focal ischemia were
examined according to the scoring scale [45, 46]. Balance in the
body trunk while being lifted by the tail was graded in line with the
following criteria: 0 = no deficit (no twisting of the body), 1 = mild
deficit (asymmetric twisting tendency of the body), and 2 = severe
deficit (repeated asymmetric twisting of the body). Motor function
of the extremities while being lifted by the tail was graded as follows: 0 = no deficit (symmetrical movement of the forelimbs), 1 =
mild deficit (intermittent asymmetrical flexion of the forelimbs),
and 2 = severe deficit (continuous asymmetrical flexion of the fore-

sum of the grades of the balance in the body trunk and motor function of the extremities.
Measurement of Infarct Lesion Volumes
The infarct lesion volumes were analyzed at 24 h (acute phase
study), or 1 or 2 weeks (chronic phase study) after ischemia (n =
20 in each group). We also produced 1-, 2-, and 3-VO models to
compare the variability in the induction rates and the depths of
ischemia (n = 10 in each group). The animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused intracardially with 20 ml of ice-cold heparinized sodium PBS (10 mM, pH 7.5) at 50–60 mm Hg to wash blood
components from the vessels in the brain. The brain was removed,
cut coronally from the frontal tip into 1-mm thick slices, and
stained by a 2% solution of 2,3,5-TTC [47]. Stained slices were
fixed by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde PBS. The absolute

a computer-assisted image-analysis system (WinROOF).
In the acute phase, an edema index (the volume of the left hemisphere divided by the volume of the right hemisphere) was used to
obtain the infarct index (the infarction volume divided by the edema
index), eliminating the influence of brain edema. The infarct index
represents the absolute infarct volume, excluding any enlargement
due to cerebral edema. In the chronic phase, the infarct volume, calculated by subtracting the volume of the intact part of the left cortex
from the volume of the right cortex, includes acute necrosis plus the
volume that represents delayed cerebral atrophy [46].
Determination of rCBF
Alterations in rCBF were monitored using by laser-Doppler
blood flowmetry at the peripheral area among the ischemic region.

is necessary to avoid all visible small vessels when the probe is
placed with the aid of a surgical microscope. Laser-Doppler recordings are expressed as percentages of the preischemic baseline.
Note: when obtaining the rCBF value before the induction of ischemia as a control, confirm the removal of the clip at the left CCA
that prevented bleeding during surgery in the left face. For placement of the laser probe, a wide exposure of the temporal bone is
needed on the right side of the burr hole. Prior to glue fixation of
the probe, needle retractors at each of the four corners is recommended to obtain a wide field of operation. A small amount of glue
is enough to fix the laser probe onto the bone surface. Avoid getting glue on the retractors or surrounding muscles.

Analyses of the Infarct Volume
In each mouse, the development of cerebral infarction
visualized by TTC staining after 3-VO was limited to the
left cortex in the MCA territory. The representative 1-mm
thick brain slices stained with TTC solution are shown in
figure 3a. The border of the TTC stain is well demarcated,
enclosing a white-infarct area in contrast to red-stained
normal brain.
The edema index in the acute phase was 1.12 ± 0.03.
The infarct volumes were 20.8 ± 3.2 mm3 (IVC: 15%),
23.2 ± 3.1 mm3 (13%), and 24.0 ± 3.5 mm3 (15%), 24 h
(acute), 7 days (chronic 1 W), or 14 days (chronic 2 W)
(mean ± SD) after ischemia, respectively (fig.  3b). The
mean infarct lesion volumes developed 24 h after 1-VO,
15-min 2-VO, and 15-min 3-VO, with rCBF monitoring
for 40 min after the induction of ischemia, are shown in
figure 3c.

Statistical Analysis
All data are presented as the means ± SD. Several general linear model procedures including multivariate repeated measures,
one-way or two-way ANOVA can be applied to compare the variance within the different parameters. Neurological deficit scores
were analyzed by the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of
ranks. Survival rates were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis: log-rank test. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

Results

Every animal survived at the time point 24 h after the
induction of 15-min 3-VO in the series of 50 consecutive
mice. There was no significant difference in body temperature, heart rate, and mean blood pressure over the
observation period before, during, and after the induction of ischemia.

Measurement of rCBF
The rCBF values in the MCA territory in the cortex,
peripheral to the ischemic core, are shown in figure 4. The
rCBF values demonstrated levels of ischemia after 1-VO
(permanent without reperfusion), 2-VO, and 3-VO (with
reperfusion). The reduction in rCBF induced by 3-VO
was the sole intervention that achieved the critical range
of rCBF >10% but <20%, which is needed for the generation of a penumbral area.

Assessment of Neurological Function and Survival
The neurological deficit scores assessed 24 h and 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days after 3-VO ischemia are shown in
figure 5. The score in the acute phase (3.0 ± 0.9) improved to a third of the initial level 7 days after ischemia. More animals survived in the group of 12- to
13-week-old mice compared to the 8- to 9-week-old
mice, although the difference in the survival rates was
not significant in the present size (p = 0.08, n = 42 in
total; fig. 6).

In this study, we attempted to generate a penumbral
region (rCBF >10% but < 20% of preischemic control values) by the 1 (single)-VO, 2 (tandem)-VO, or 3 (multiple)VO method in mice (fig. 1c), and demonstrated that single or tandem occlusion does not cause a significant reduction that is consistently below the upper threshold.
Because of the cerebrovascular reserve system, simple occlusion of the MCA trunk did not generate infarcted lesions of consistent size in the cortex.
Regarding the relationship between the number of occluded arteries and the incidence of cerebral infarction in
normotensive rats, permanent occlusion of the MCA orifice (1-VO, the arterial origin; 1–2 mm) by a vascular

clip, which does not stimulate the coagulation system in
the blood or generate multiple embolisms, resulted in cerebral infarction in only 13% of cases [48]. The wellknown 1-VO method [49] targeting the proximal MCA
(in the M1 segment), the location where the lenticulostriate perforating arteries of the basal ganglia originate, provides a reliable model for causing reproducible infarctions in the basal ganglia, but generates infarctions of
varying size in the cortex [50].
Furuya et al. [51] reported a 1-VO model using
C57BL/6J mice (the strain used in this study and also the
strain most widely used to generate transgenic animals)
in which clip-occlusion of the MCA (1-VO) for 1–2 h, at
a location proximal to the olfactory branch, achieved
rCBF that was 30% of preischemic control values on average, providing infarcted lesions with IVC values of 15–
32%, and mortality rates of 18–20% at 24 h (the anatomical distribution of the infarcted lesion was not described).
The IVC value and the mortality rate were low to moderate in their 1-VO model, but the time needed for generation of consistently ischemic lesions was relatively long
(the equivalent of about 12–24 h in humans).
Permanent occlusion of the proximal MCA and the
ipsilateral internal carotid artery (permanent 2-VO, tandem) has also led to the development of an infarct of varying size in the cortex of normotensive rats, ranging from
38 ± 50 to 209 ± 34 mm3 (IVC: 16–132%) [50]. In other

3-VO ischemia. All animals survived after ischemia in the acute
phase. The survival rate in the chronic phase decreased to 50% in
the group of 8- to 9-week-old mice (n = 32), but only to 80% in the
12- to 13-week-old animals (n = 10).

In the ITI method, apart from the variability in volumes, infarcted lesions easily spread beyond the MCA
territory, including to the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and retina, probably via
thrombus/embolus formation on the surface of the inserted thread [36, 38, 54]. Moreover, it is known that a
slight difference in thread characteristics (diameter, tensile strength, and extensibility) causes great variability in
infarct lesion volumes and their reproducibility [35], and
there has been criticism that the data obtained using the
ITI model are still far from being standardized worldwide
[51]. Numerous modifications of occlusive thread have
been reported, including the recent proposal that the
length of the thread coating should be adjusted to avoid
occlusion of the ipsilateral posterior communicating artery and the subsequent expansion of the ischemic lesion
into the posterior cerebral artery territory that results in
development of massive cerebral infarction and acute
death in C57BL/6 mice [55, 56].
In primates (baboons), proximal MCA clip occlusion
(1-VO) for 6 h generated cerebral infarction limited to the
basal ganglia in 60% (6/10 cases) of animals [57]. Proximal MCA balloon occlusion (1 or 2-VO) for 1 h produced
a small infarction limited to the basal ganglia in 67% (4/6
cases), and with a high mortality rate of 33% at 14 h after
reperfusion in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta)
[58]. These data on primates demonstrate that the 1- or
2-VO strategy is particularly limited in terms of generating infarcted lesions of consistent size. In contrast, using
a modified 3-VO method (both anterior cerebral arteries
and the MCA distal to the orbitofrontal branch) for 1 h
produced moderate-sized infarcted lesions in the cortex
(25.8 ± 2.1%, IVC: 8.1%, n = 5), with no mortality at 48 h
in rhesus macaques [59]. Thus, the consequences of 1-,
2-, and 3-VO in both rodents and primates are similar.
The adequacy of the MCA model in the evaluation of
neuroprotective intervention depends on the achievement of an appropriate reduction in the rCBF. Although
3-VO was designed to produce an ischemic penumbra
consistently for a specified period, an identical 3-VO pattern with the same onset seldom occurs in humans. Regarding the general relevance of the 3-VO method to clinical stroke, the anatomy of cerebral arteries comprising
the anterior, middle, posterior, and communicating arteries, perforating arteries in the basal ganglia, and abundant anastomoses in the cortex are the same for rodents,
primates, and humans. Therefore, the significance of the
vascular reserve system in the cortex and the strategy
needed to generate ischemic penumbra do not differ between primates and rodents. Based on this common anaYang /Nakajo /Iihara /Kataoka /

words, the 2-VO method involving the proximal portion
of the MCA, a similar strategy to that utilized in the ITI
method, produces substantial variability in IVC values.
Because of the system of cerebrovascular reserve, it is difficult to induce a consistent reduction in rCBF below
20%, in order to generate a penumbral area, using the
1-VO or 2-VO methods. In contrast, the 3-VO technique
has consistently generated a penumbral area, with an
rCBF between 10 and 20% (fig. 1c, 2 right).
Temporary 3-VO does not cause thrombus/embolus
formation [29]. On the other hand, pharmaceutical or
thrombin-induced MCA occlusion models [52] are designed to cause severe stagnation in the bloodstream that
stimulates the intravascular coagulation system, resulting
in thrombus/embolus formation and hemostasis-induced segmental occlusion. Such segmental occlusion
tends to cause localized multivessel occlusion, which reduces vascular reserve and increases the probability of cerebral infarction. In the permanent 3-VO occlusion model with vascular clips, without the insertion of a foreign
body that stimulates the coagulation system, the reduction in the rCBF was not permanent, but recovered to
>30% of the preischemic value within 4 h after the induction of ischemia [53]. It was thus demonstrated that permanent 3-VO without blood stagnation or coagulation in
the vascular lumen is not accompanied by a persistent
reduction in rCBF, probably due to compensatory gradual dilatation of collaterals. Such a delayed activation of
vascular reserve can not rescue the brain under ischemic
penumbra without the induction of hypothermia [53] or
other neuroprotective interventions, but it may prevent
the expansion of the tissue damage.
In the ITI method, an adequate reduction in rCBF of
below 20%, which is needed for the induction of an infarcted lesion, was achieved in just 46% of cases in the
primary thread trial, and another 10% achieved successful reduction with filament correction based on rCBF
monitoring in Sprague-Dawley rats [28]. In order to exclude cases of incomplete vessel occlusion, and also to
exclude cases of thread insertion-derived traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage that increases IVC, bilateral monitoring of rCBF in each animal was essential and an exclusion of animals (34%) with no infarction was necessary to
obtain a low IVC in the ITI model [28]. When the ITI
method was applied to C57BL/6 mice, 42% of cases had
to be excluded because of spontaneous recovery in rCBF
of above 30% during the thread-insertion period, which
led to no or only faint development of an infarcted lesion
[37]. Thus, the success rates in the ITI method in both rats
and mice are similar.

conduct appropriate evaluations of ischemic injuries and
disclose excluded animals, may also occur in primates.
Because a pure cortical infarct in the MCA territory is
not considered lethal and the mortality rate was reduced
in slightly (4-weeks) older mice, it is possible that drinking and eating disturbances in the acute phase after surgery affected survivability in mice. Whether appropriate
nutritional management in the acute phase may reduce
the mortality rate, as was observed in this study, is a matter requiring further investigation.
Regarding the choice of anesthetics, it has been reported that significant respiratory depression was not observed with isoflurane, sevoflurane, or halothane in mice
[62]. Although there is a transient increase in plasma lactate levels after ischemia [63, 64], isoflurane has been used
as an alternative to halothane in mice [36], where halothane has not been readily available.
We utilized the TTC method that visualizes surviving
neurons and proliferation of reactive astrocytes (gliosis)
in the acute and chronic phase, rather than utilizing the
cresyl violet method that stains only surviving neurons. It
was found that the infarct lesion rates in the total hemisphere were almost identical for both methods, but the
brain tissue including degenerating and dead tissues
shrank to 66%, on average, of the original volume after
the dehydration procedure that forms part of the cresyl
violet method, making it unsuitable for a chronological
comparison [65]. In addition, the volume of gliosis in the
chronic phase that can be visualized with glial fibrillary
acidic protein was negligible in the analysis of infarcted
volumes in the cortex. This was because measurable gliosis was found only in the corpus callosum below the cortical lesion, rather than in the border zone of focal ischemia in the cortex [65].
In the manipulation of animals, it is important to recognize that the rate of passage of biological time is correlated inversely with [body weight]2, as represented by
longevity and heart/respiration rate among animal species [66]. The biological time of 15–30 min in mice is regarded as 30 min to 1 h in rats [67], and 3–6 h in humans
[68]. Seven days after ischemia in mice can be translated
into 3 months in humans, a sufficient time for a mild-tomoderate neurological deficit to improve.
The new 3-VO model consistently induced temporary
focal ischemia with a critical, but treatable, reduction in
rCBF of 10–20% in the cortex, within the ischemic penumbra, which achieves a shorter, less invasive duration of
surgery compared to other mouse models in the literature
where the duration of ischemia was 30 (40) min [69], 60
min [39, 51], 90 min [40, 41, 70], or 120 min [51]. Com-

tomical background, the occlusion of both CCAs is not
an emulation of human stroke, but instead a substitute of
the state with appropriately reduced vascular reserve [15].
The logic and rationale for the 3-VO occlusion technique in rodents and primates is as follows. Permanent
loss of MCA perfusion is not by itself sufficient to produce reliable infarcts due to the capacity of the collateral
vasculature to maintain adequate blood flow to its territory. Since the preponderance of the literature indicates
that even severe ischemia, although perhaps producing
some selective loss of vulnerable neurons, does not lead
to consistent cortical infarction, it would therefore appear
that reducing collateral perfusion (for only 15 min in
mice, or 1 h in primates) results in a state of more severe
vascular insufficiency than would have persisted if only
the MCA had been occluded. Perhaps this reflects a transition to a state characterized by constrictive vascular responses, i.e. an inverse hemodynamic response to spreading depolarization or intermediate peri-infarct (ischemic) depolarization in the peri-infarct region [13],
referred to as monophasic hypoperfusion [60]. Theoretically, neurons in the ischemic penumbra can survive for
a prolonged period if sufficient dilatation of the collaterals occurs (as observed in the stage 2). Transient depression of electrical activity on EEG caused by spreading depolarization and lasting for a few minutes in tissue under
nonischemic normal conditions is accompanied by vasodilatation of collaterals and hyperemia [13, 61]. However,
such compensatory, dilative vascular responses have not
been observed in the peri-infarct area in positron emission tomography studies of patients with acute ischemic
stroke (unpubl. observation). In accord with this finding,
monophasic hypoperfusion (caused by reactive, prolonged vasoconstriction) can be observed at the peri-infarct region, where a cluster of intermediate peri-infarct
or ischemic depolarizations were found to cause persistent depression of electrical activity (persistent electrical
silence) [13, 60]. It is likely that persistent electrical silence (persistent depression of neuronal activity) with
preserved energy metabolism is integral to the definition
of ischemic penumbra.
Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that primate
ischemic models are superior to rodent models in the assessment of ischemic damage in the brain. We believe that
it is not rodent models or the body sizes, but researcher
manipulation of rodent models that has become unreliable. Without the consideration of the cerebrovascular
reserve system, an intrinsic mechanism to prevent focal
ischemia, especially to protect the cortex after 1- or 2-VO,

pletion of surgery takes 10 min (as shown in the online
suppl. video) excluding the time for 15 min of ischemia.
To detect a 30% improvement in the mean infarct lesion
volume, the previous 15-min 3-VO model required 42 animals in both placebo and treatment groups, with 80% power (1-β) in a t test based on normal distribution [29], whereas the present model only requires 10 mice [46, 71]. Concerning the mortality rate in this model, the 4-week-older
condition, or the age-dependent 3-gram (11–13%) gain in
body weight, reduced the mortality rate in the chronic
phase. Further investigations are needed to identify standard infarct lesion volumes for different ages, different nutritional statuses, and different species and genders.

produce an ischemic penumbra of consistent size. Our
established methodology is expected to produce reliable
preclinical evidence in the assessment of interventions
that treat the ischemic penumbra, aiming to protect the
brain from ischemic stroke.
