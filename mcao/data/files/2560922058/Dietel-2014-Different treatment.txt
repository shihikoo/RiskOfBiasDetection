Background: Cerebral ischemia is associated with infectious complications due to immunosuppression
and decreased T lymphocyte activity. G-CSF, which has neuroprotective properties, is known to modulate
inﬂammatory processes after induced stroke. The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of GCSF in experimental stroke and to compare two different modes of treatment, focusing on circulating T
lymphocytes.
Methods: Cerebral ischemia was induced in Wistar rats by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, followed
by reperfusion after 1 h. G-CSF was applied either as a single dose 30 min after occlusion, or daily for seven
days. Silver staining was used to determine infarct size. T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood were
measured before and 7 days after induced cerebral ischemia by ﬂow cytometry. In addition, migration of
CD3-expressing T lymphocytes into the brain was investigated by immunohistochemistry.
Results: Both single dose and daily treatment with G-CSF signiﬁcantly reduced infarct size. A signiﬁcant improvement of neurological outcome was only observed after single application of G-CSF. While
a decrease in peripheral T lymphocytes was detected seven days after induced stroke, no reduction was
observed in the G-CSF-treated groups. Apart from that, G-CSF signiﬁcantly reduced the number of brain
migrated T lymphocytes in both treatment settings as compared to vehicle.
Conclusion: A single dose of G-CSF exerted neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke, which were less
pronounced after daily G-CSF application. Both treatment strategies inhibited stroke-induced reduction
of T lymphocytes in peripheral blood, which may have contributed to the reduction of infarct size.

1. Introduction
Cerebral ischemia is accompanied by a pronounced immunosuppression, known as the cerebral immunodepressive syndrome
(CIDS), which constitutes a major complication and contributes
to the mortality of stroke patients [1–3]. An inhibition of T

cell-mediated immunity is assumed to be involved in strokeinduced CIDS [4–6]. Accordingly, Czlonkowska et al. reported a
signiﬁcant reduction of T lymphocytes in peripheral blood of
patients suffering from cerebral infarction. Apart from the decrease
in T cell numbers, a reduced function of T helper cells also seems
to contribute to post-stroke immunodepression [5]. To reduce the
detrimental effects of CIDS, it is important to investigate new
approaches to the treatment of stroke which exert neuroprotective effects while, at the same time, not compromising the adaptive
immune system. Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF)
represents a neuroprotective growth factor which has been shown
to reduce the infarct size in experimental stroke [7–9]. Besides,
G-CSF has already been investigated in a phase II clinical trial,
where both safety and tolerability over a broad dose range of GCSF have been proven in patients suffering from acute ischemic
stroke [10]. With regard to its impact on the immune system, G-CSF

is known for its immunomodulating effects. Accordingly, we have
shown that G-CSF inhibited both dendritic cell maturation and their
cerebral migration in an experimental stroke model [9]. However,
only limited information exists about potential effects of G-CSF on
T lymphocytes following stroke. Therefore, the aim of our study was
to investigate the effects of G-CSF on both cerebral T cell inﬁltration
and circulating T cells in peripheral blood after induced experimental stroke. Additionally, we compared two different treatment
settings, a single intraperitoneal application versus a single dose
followed by daily intramuscular injections of G-CSF.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals
All experiments were performed in accordance with European
Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC) and approved by the
local ethics committee (Government of Middle Franconia). Male
Wistar rats (280–360 g) were randomly assigned to the following
groups: (A) Sham surgery group (n = 15: all procedures without
occlusion of middle cerebral artery, 0.5 ml saline i.m. daily); (B)
control group (n = 15: tMCAO for 60 min, 0.5 ml saline i.m. daily);
(C) single G-CSF group (n = 15: tMCAO for 60 min, treatment with
60 ␮g/kg body weight (bw) i.p. G-CSF (recombinant human GCSF, Neupogen® , Amgen) in 0.5 ml of saline 30 min after tMCAO
begin) and D, daily G-CSF group (n = 15: tMCAO for 60 min, 60 ␮g/kg
bw i.p. G-CSF in 0.5 ml saline 30 min after tMCAO begin + daily
treatment with 60 ␮g/kg bw i.m. G-CSF in 0.5 ml saline for seven
days). Animals were housed under controlled temperature with
free access to food and water and were kept on a 12 h light/12 h dark
cycle.
Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by the transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (60 min) as previously described
[9,11]. Brieﬂy, after induction of anesthesia, an incision was made
slightly right to the midline of the neck to expose the right common
carotid artery and the external carotid artery. A 4-0 monoﬁlament
nylon suture coated with silicon was inserted into the distal right
common carotid artery and carefully advanced into the internal
carotid artery. The ﬁlament was left in place for 60 min, whereupon
reperfusion was induced. Sham-operated animals underwent same
experimental procedures as described above, but no intravascular
ﬁlament occlusion was performed.
In both modes of treatment, 60 ␮g/kg body weight was chosen
as single dosage for G-CSF [12,13]. The intraperitoneal application
of G-CSF, which we applied for the ﬁrst injection, when animals
were still anesthetized, has already been reported in experimental stroke, where it efﬁciently reduced the infarct size of ischemic
rats [13]. As described in clinical trials and experimental studies,
investigating the effects of G-CSF, we used an intramuscular injection for the daily treatment setting, since the immunomodulatory
impact of G-CSF is well reported for the intramuscular route [14].
Besides, intramuscular injections are less hazardous compared to
intravenous applications, which have also been used to explore the
impact of G-CSF in experimental stroke.

2.3. Silver infarct staining (SIS)
After seven days, rats were perfused with saline and brains were
removed. For the measurement of the infarct size SIS was used
on 20 ␮m thick brain sections at six different brain levels 2 mm
apart from each other (+5.2 mm to −1.2 mm from the bregma) [16].
The infarct size was calculated as percentage of the right hemisphere using a computerized image analyzer (Bio Scan Optimas) by
the following formula: CIV = NIH − (IH − IV), where CIV is corrected
infarct volume; NIH, the volume of the nonischemic hemisphere;
IH, volume of the ischemic hemisphere; and IV infarct volume. For
this issue, the areas of the ischemic and non-ischemic hemisphere
were multiplied by the slice thickness to calculate the volume of
the hemispheres. Measurements were performed blinded to the
treatment group.
2.4. Immunohistochemical staining
The staining procedure to detect inﬁltrated inﬂammatory cells
was carried out on two coronal brain cross-sections from each animal (+3.2 mm and +2.2 mm from the bregma) using an antibody
against T lymphocytes (anti-CD3, DAKO, 1:500). CSA-Kit combined
with an additional blocking step of endogenous avidin and biotin
was used as reported [9]. Total numbers of T cells per coronal brain
cross-section were counted at a magniﬁcation of 150× using a light
microscope. For each section, images were obtained with a CCD
camera.

2.2. Neuroscore
Seven days after tMCAO, all animals were evaluated for neurological outcome using the neuroscore as a scale according to
Menzies [15]: 0, no apparent deﬁcit; 1, contralateral forelimb ﬂexion; 2, decreased grip of contralateral forelimb while tail pulled; 3,
spontaneous movement in all directions, contralateral circling only
if pulled by tail; 4, spontaneous contralateral circling. Testing was
performed by an investigator blinded to earlier treatment.

2.5. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)

3. Results

Blood samples were collected before and 7 days after tMCAO and
processed as described [9]. Cell surface staining was carried out by
30 min of incubation with monoclonal antibodies (FITC-conjugated
anti-CD4, Pe-conjugated anti-CD3, BD Biosciences) and the corresponding IgG isotype antibodies. Flow cytometric measurements
were performed using FACS-Calibur to determine percentages of
CD3+ cells and CD3+ CD4+ cells in total leukocytes and analyzed
using CellQuest Pro Software (BD Biosciences).

2.6. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software.
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test served as normality test. Analysis of
variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc test served for multiple
comparison. Menzies scores were compared using Kruskal Wallis
test. Pre and post surgery ﬂow cytometric data were compared with
the paired t-test. Correlation between the infarct size and cerebral
T cell numbers was analyzed by Spearman Rank order test. Data
are expressed as mean ± SEM. p < 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

97

Infarct size was assessed seven days after induced tMCAO using
SIS (Fig. 1A). As already reported by us [9], the infarct size was
signiﬁcantly smaller after single treatment with G-CSF (vehicle:
35.1 ± 3.8% of right hemisphere; single G-CSF: 19.0 ± 5.4% of right
hemisphere; p < 0.05; Fig. 1A and B). Besides, the neurological
outcome was signiﬁcantly improved (Menzies score: 1.3 ± 0.7 vs.
0.7 ± 0.6; p < 0.05) compared to vehicle. After the additional daily
applications of G-CSF, the infarct size was also decreased (vehicle: 35.1 ± 3.8% of right hemisphere; daily G-CSF: 22.1 ± 6.1% of
right hemisphere; p < 0.05; Fig. 1A and B). However no signiﬁcant
improvement of the neurological outcome was observed (Menzies
score: 1.3 ± 0.7 vs. 0.9 ± 0.7).
3.2. G-CSF inhibits recruitment of T lymphocytes into the
infarcted brain
To evaluate the recruitment of T lymphocytes into the infarcted
brain, we determined the numbers of CD3-expressing T cells
per coronal brain section using immunohistochemical staining

98

(Fig. 2A). We found a signiﬁcant decrease in T cell numbers after
the single (86 ± 24 cells per tissue section) and the daily application of G-CSF (89 ± 12 cells per tissue section) compared to vehicle
(172 ± 15 cells per tissue section; Fig. 2B). In addition, cerebral T cell
numbers positively correlated with infarct size (r = 0.501, p = 0.017,
Fig. 2C).
3.3. G-CSF suppresses stroke-induced decrease in T lymphocytes
in peripheral blood
T lymphocytes in peripheral blood were quantiﬁed by ﬂow
cytometry. While baseline levels showed no signiﬁcant changes
among the four groups, seven days after surgery a signiﬁcant
reduction of both circulating CD3-expressing T cells (Fig. 3A and
B) and CD3-CD4-expressing T helper cells (Fig. 3C and D) was
observed in the tMCAO group compared to Sham surgery group
(CD3+ : 45.6 ± 3.0% after Sham surgery vs. 40.1 ± 1.9% after tMCAO;
CD3+ CD4+ : 33.4 ± 2.5 after Sham vs. 27.5 ± 1.3 after tMCAO).
This reduction was inhibited after both single and daily application of G-CSF (CD3+ : 45.6 ± 3.0% after Sham vs. 43.2 ± 2.0%
after tMCAO + single G-CSF vs. 46.6 ± 1.7% after tMCAO + daily GCSF, Fig. 3A and B; CD3+ CD4+ : 33.4 ± 2.5% after Sham surgery

vs. 31.2 ± 2.0% after tMCAO + single G-CSF vs. 34.6 ± 2.3% after
tMCAO + daily G-CSF, Fig. 3C and D).
4. Discussion
The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of the neuroprotective growth factor G-CSF on cerebral T cell migration and
circulating T cells in peripheral blood. In addition, we investigated whether the neuroprotective impact of a single application
of G-CSF on the infarct size and the neurological outcome [9]
can be enhanced by additional daily applications of the growth
factor.
We found a reduced infarct size in both G-CSF-treated groups
compared to the vehicle group, which conﬁrmed the reported neuroprotective action of the growth factor [7,9,17]. Comparing the
two different treatment settings, the neuroprotective effect was
more pronounced after the single intraperitoneal application of GCSF. Moreover, only the single application signiﬁcantly improved
neurological outcome, whereas the daily application caused only
a slight, non-signiﬁcant improvement. These ﬁndings indicate that
the single injection of G-CSF was more beneﬁcial than the daily
application. As shown in former studies, some of the beneﬁcial

effects of G-CSF are related to its strong anti-inﬂammatory effects
[8,9]. Stroke-induced cerebral tissue damage is most pronounced in
the ﬁrst hours following the ischemic stroke [18]. Thus, a possible
explanation for the lack of beneﬁt of the additional daily application
might be due to a small therapeutic time window of neuroprotective agents for the prevention of ischemic tissue damage. However,
Schneider et al. observed a reduction of the infarct size also after
delayed application of G-CSF. In that study G-CSF was injected intravenously for 10 days, starting 24 h after the induction of ischemia
in a rat photothrombotic model which demonstrated a neuroprotective action in the post-stroke recovery phase [12]. As for the
marginal impact of the daily application of G-CSF on the neurological outcome, our results were in agreement with the ﬁndings
of Zhao et al., who evaluated the neurological recovery 1, 4 and 7
weeks after daily injections of 50 ␮g/ml G-CSF for seven days in
a permanent occlusion model. Both the limb placement test and
the foot fault test, which were used in their study, did not show
a signiﬁcant improvement of stroke-induced neurological deﬁcits
after G-CSF treatment [19]. Another explanation for the absence of
any protective effects on the neurological outcome following daily
application of G-CSF might be the impairment of the locomotor system [20,21]. Accordingly, moderate bone and muscle pain belongs
to the most common side effect, which affect 70–80% of healthy
persons after repeated injections of G-CSF and might explain, why
single G-CSF application is superior to the daily one with regard to
neurological outcome.
In agreement with former studies, we observed an intense cerebral migration of T lymphocytes seven days after experimental
stroke [22], which positively correlated with the infarct size. The
application of G-CSF in both modes of treatment led to a reduced
number of recruited T lymphocytes in the ischemic hemisphere. In
agreement with recent ﬁndings stroke-induced cerebral inﬁltration
of T cells was accompanied by a signiﬁcant reduction of T lymphocytes in peripheral blood [5], which has been shown to contribute
to the detrimental effects of stroke-induced immunodepression.
In contrast, no reduction of blood circulating T lymphocytes was
observed after the application of G-CSF, which is a new ﬁnding from our study. So far, increased levels in circulating blood
was detected only in monocytes in G-CSF treated ischemic mice
[23]. Current evidence suggests that cerebral ischemia induces an
overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) which
mediates stroke-induced immunodeﬁciency syndrome [24,25].
Accordingly, Katayama et al. demonstrated that an overactivated
SNS inhibits the egress of hematopoetic stem cells from the bone
marrow [26], which contributes to systemic immunodepression
following cerebral ischemia. G-CSF induces the mobilization of
hematopoetic stem cells into the peripheral circulation [27]. This
represents a potential mechanism for the prevention of peripheral T lymphopenia, by counteracting the impact of the hyperactive
SNS.
Another possible explanation for the observed inhibition of T
lymphopenia by G-CSF might be that stroke-induced reduction
of peripheral T cells is secondary to their recruitment into the
infarcted brain, as previously suggested for the reduction of circulating dendritic cells both in patients suffering from ischemic
stroke and those with coronary artery disease [28,29]. Accordingly,
G-CSF has been reported to reduce blood–brain barrier disruption,
which may contribute to the decrease in cerebral T cell inﬁltration
[13]. However, the recruitment of immune cells into one tissue
site, irrespective whether into the brain or the vessel wall, is a
rather unlikely single reason for the distinct reduction of the cell
numbers in peripheral blood. Indeed, the recruitment from the
circulation into the lymphoid organs as well as the apoptosis of
immune cells might also contribute to stroke-induced immunodepression.

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, the ﬁndings of our study suggest that the single intraperitoneal application of G-CSF exerts more pronounced
neuroprotective effects compared to a single dose followed by
daily applications, which might result from an impairment of the
locomotor system after repeated injections of the growth factor.
Besides, we have shown that G-CSF modulates the T cell-speciﬁc
immune response following stroke. Decreased numbers of brain
migrated T lymphocytes in G-CSF treated animals might be associated with an absence of stroke-induced reduction of T lymphocytes
in the peripheral blood. Experimental studies with tagged T lymphocytes will be necessary to demonstrate whether the reduction
of blood circulating T cells is due to their recruitment into the
infarcted brain.
