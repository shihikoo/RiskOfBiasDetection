ABSTRACT
Objective: TSI is a new drug derived from Chinese medicine for
treatment of ischemic stroke in China. The aim of this study was to
verify the therapeutic effect of TSI in a rat model of MCAO, and
further explore the mechanism for its effect.
Methods: Male Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to right
MCAO for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion. TSI (1.67 mg/kg)
was administrated before reperfusion via femoral vein injection.
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the fluorescence intensity of
DHR 123 in, leukocyte adhesion to and albumin leakage from the
cerebral venules were observed. Neurological scores, TTC staining,
brain water content, Nissl staining, TUNEL staining, and MDA
content were assessed. Bcl-2/Bax, cleaved caspase-3, NADPH
oxidase subunits p47phox/p67phox/gp91phox, and AMPK/Akt/PKC
were analyzed by Western blot.
Results: TSI attenuated I/R-induced microcirculatory disturbance
and neuron damage, activated AMPK, inhibited NADPH oxidase
subunits membrane translocation, suppressed Akt phosphorylation,
and PKC translocation.

Conclusions: TSI attenuates I/R-induced brain injury in rats,
supporting its clinic use for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. The
role of TSI may benefit from its antioxidant activity, which is most
likely implemented via inactivation of NADPH oxidase through a
signaling pathway implicating AMPK/Akt/PKC.

INTRODUCTION
Thrombolysis is currently applied for treatment of ischemic
stroke for restoration of blood flow to the ischemic region [2].

ª 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

However, thrombolysis therapy is, in addition to limited time
window, frequently complicated by increased generation of
ROS, which causes microcirculatory disturbance characterized by increased leukocyte adhesion to microvasculature and

615

breakdown of BBB, and exacerbates brain injury leading to a
poor outcome of the patients with acute ischemia stroke [3].
Thus, approach aiming at attenuating oxidative stress may be
promising as an adjuvant strategy for individuals undergoing
thrombolysis therapy.
Following reperfusion, ROS generates in brain from
various sources, including mitochondria, invading neutrophils, activated microglia/macrophages, cerebral blood vessels,
as well as neurons [8]. Oxidative stress arises due to an
imbalance in redox state in which prooxidants overwhelm
antioxidant capacity. Several drugs that target oxidative stress
have been developed, such as alpha-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitron and apomorphine. However, most of the drugs target
ROS only after they are formed and do not intervene the
process by which these toxic molecules are generated. The
drawback of this strategy is that the ROS may already cause
damage before they are inactivated. Thus, regime that targets
the source of ROS is preferable [31].
NADPH oxidase is one of the major enzyme sources of ROS,
which evokes cerebral microcirculatory disturbance and
initiates neuronal apoptosis in I/R-damaged brain [17].
NADPH oxidase was first identified in phagocytes. Over the
last years, six homologs of the cytochrome subunit of the
phagocyte NADPH oxidase were found: NOX1, NOX3, NOX4,
NOX5, DOUX1, and DOUX2, which together with phagocyte
NADPH oxidase itself (NOX2/ gp91phox) are now referred to as
NOX family of NADPH oxidases. These enzymes share the
capacity to transfer electron from NADPH inside the cell across
the membrane generating superoxide and other downstream
ROS. The activation mechanism and tissue distribution of each
member of the family are different. Phagocyte NADPH oxidase
NOX2 expresses not only in phagocytes but also in a number of
nonphagocyte cells, including endothelial cells and neurons.
Phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex consists of six subunits
including two membrane-bound elements (gp91phox and
p22phox), three cytosolic components (p67phox, p47phox, and
p40phox), and a low-molecular-weight G protein (either rac 2 or
rac 1). In response to ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) challenge,
p47phox is phosphorylated and translocates from cytosol to
membrane, thereby brings the activator protein p67phox in
contact with gp91phox in membrane, leading to activation of
NADPH oxidase [1].
PKB/Akt and PKC known to phosphorylate p47 [7,15] are
regulated by AMPK [24], a serine/threonine protein kinase
[13]. However, no management is available so far to
modulate activation of NADPH oxidase by interfering in
AMPK/Akt/PKC signaling for treatment of ischemia stroke.
TSI is an injection of the major water-soluble ingredients
of Salvia miltiorrhiza, including 3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl lactic
acid, salvianolic acid A, salvianolic acid B, and other
salvianolic acids, which was approved in 2011 by the Chinese
State Food and Drug Administration (Z20110011) for
treatment of ischemic stroke [12]. Studies suggested that

616

salvianolic acids have effects of antioxidation [5], antiinflammation [6], and antiapoptosis [21]. In addition, our
previous study has demonstrated that total salvianolic acid
can improve I/R-induced microcirculatory disturbance in rat
mesentery, an effect that is most likely associated with
inhibiting the production of oxygen-free radicals [29].
However, study regarding the role of TSI in ischemic stroke
is limited, and the mechanism behind the antioxidant
potential of TSI remains elusive.
This study was designed to investigate the role of TSI in
I/R-evoked brain injury and gain insight into the mechanism
responsible for the antioxidant capacity of TSI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male Sprague–Dawley rats weighing 280  10 g were purchased from the Animal Center of Peking University Health
Science Center (Certificate no. SCXK (Jing) 2006-0008). The
animals were raised at 22  2°C and humidity of 40  5%
under a 12-hour light/dark cycle, and fed with standard diet
and water ad libitum. The rats were fasted for 12 hours
before experiment, but allowed free access to water. The
experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with
the European Commission Guidelines (2010/63/EU) and
Guidelines of the Peking University Animal Research Committee. The protocols were approved by the Committee on
the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the Health Science
Center of Peking University (LA2011-38).

Animal Preparation and Experimental Groups
Rats were subjected to right MCAO and reperfusion, as
reported previously [16,23]. Briefly, after anesthetized with
pentobarbital sodium (0.1 g/kg body weight) intraperitoneally, neck vessels were exposed via a midline incision, and
branches of the right external carotid artery were isolated and
cauterized. A 4-0-monofilament nylon suture was prepared
by rounding the tip to approximately 0.38 mm in diameter
with a scorch. The right middle cerebral artery was occluded
with the suture by inserting it through the right external
carotid artery and gently advancing into the internal carotid
artery up to a point approximately 18 mm distance from the
bifurcation of the carotid artery. Reperfusion was achieved by
slowly pulling the suture back after 60 minutes occlusion.
The incision on the neck was sutured and the animals were
allowed to recover. Rectal temperature was maintained at
37  0.5°C throughout the procedure from the start of the
surgery until the recovery of the animals from anesthesia
with a thermostat-controlled heating pad [16].
A total of 132 rats were included and randomly divided
into four groups: (i) sham group, (ii) sham + TSI group,
(iii) I/R group, and (iv) I/R + TSI group, 33 animals each
(see Table 1 for further details). In the sham group, rats were

The same animals were used for detection of Neurological scores and
TTC staining. The same was for determination of oxidative stress and
brain water content. The same was for immunohistochemistry
staining and Confocal. The same was for MDA level and Western
blot assay.

operated in the same way, but without occlusion of middle
cerebral artery. In TSI-treated groups, TSI (1.67 mg/kg; Tasly
Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, Tianjin, China) was administrated
by femoral vein injection (2 mL/h) two minutes before the
beginning of reperfusion. The animals in sham group and I/R
group were given equivalent volume of saline in the same
manner. Determination of the dose of TSI used in this study
was based on clinical routine dose conversion [25]. All
variables in this study were examined at 24 hours after
reperfusion.

Neurological Scores and Infarct Size
Neurological scores were evaluated as described in Table 2
[10]. Each animal’s scores were estimated within approxi-

mately one minute, and estimation was repeated three times
for consistency. Score of 15 corresponds to a normal
neurological status, and lower scores correspond to a
behavioral deficit.
For TTC staining, rats were euthanized, decapitated, and
then the brains were rapidly removed. Infarct volumes
(n = 6) were measured as described previously [27]. In brief,
brains were cut into five coronal brain slices (2 mm thick)
with a matrix (Brain Matrix; WPI-Europe, Aston, Stevenage,
UK), and incubated in 1% TTC (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 15 minutes at 37°C to identify the infarction area. The
infarction tissue remained unstained (white), whereas
normal tissue was stained (red). The infarct zone was
analyzed by Image-Pro Plus 5.0 software (Media Cybernetic,
Bethesda, MD, USA). The infarct volume was calculated
by the equation [(contralateral hemisphere volume
noninfarcted volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere)/
contralateral hemisphere volume] to avoid the influence of
brain edema [9].

Observation of Cerebral Microcirculation
At 24 hours after reperfusion, the animal’s head was secured
in a stereotactic frame after anesthetized. With a hand-held
drill (STRONG-90; Saechin, Paho-Dong, Dalseo-ku, Taegu,
Korea), a 4 9 6 mm2 cranial window was performed
through an incision 1 mm behind the coronal suture, and
1 mm on the right side of the sagittal suture. This location
corresponds to the margin of the middle cerebral artery
territory. The dura was removed and the pia mater was
superfused contiguously with 37°C warm physiological saline
[16]. This process was performed before observation with an
upright fluorescence microscope (BX51WI; Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan) equipped with a supersensitive CCD camera (USS301; UNIQ Vision, Santa Clara, CA, USA), a color monitor
(20PF5120, Philips, Eindhoven, Netherland), a video timer
(VTG-33, FOR.A, Tokyo, Japan), and a DVD recorder
(DVR-560H, Philips, Eindhoven, Netherland).

Oxidative Stress and Brain Water Content
To monitor oxidative stress in venular walls, the hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2)-sensitive fluorescent probe DHR 123
(Molecular Probes, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was administrated to the superfusate (10 lmol/L) before observation
[32]. In the presence of oxidants, nonfluorescent DHR was
oxidized to fluorescent rhodamine 123, providing a measurable signal for the oxidative reaction. Fluorescence intensity
in the lumen (Ia) and in the venular wall (Iw) of selected
microvessel segments was acquired and estimated via the
fluorescence microscope under irradiation at wavelength of
543 nm [18]. The values were averaged with Image-Pro Plus
5.0 software (Media Cybernetic), then the difference between
Ia and Iw (DI) was used to estimate the relative levels of
oxidized DHR.
The brains (n = 6) were quickly removed and separated
into the left and right cerebral hemispheres and weighed (wet
weight). Brain specimens were then dried in an oven at
120°C for 48 hours and weighed again (dry weight). The
percentage of water content was calculated as [(wet weight
dry weight)/wet weight] 9 100% [14]. Only the right sides
of the brains were evaluated for statistic in this study.

Leukocyte Adhesion
The cerebral venules ranging from 35 to 45 lm in diameter
and 200 lm in length were selected for this study. The
fluorescence tracer R6G (Fluka Chemie AG, Buchs, Switzerland) was administrated (5 mg/kg) to the animal via the
femoral vein 10 minutes before observation. After craniotomy, the cerebral cortex venules were observed under
irradiation at wavelength of 543 nm. The adherent leukocytes were identified as cells that are attached to the venular
walls for more than 30 seconds [20]. Pictures were evaluated
with Image-Pro Plus 5.0 software.

Albumin Leakage
Ten minutes before observation, the rats were intravenously
injected with 50 mg/kg body weight fluorescein FITC-labeled
albumin (Sigma-Aldrich) through femoral vein. Only rats
whose cranial windows were without any bleeding or
inflammatory process were included in this study [16]. The
venule images were acquired under irradiation at wavelength
of 488 nm. The fluorescence intensities of FITC-labeled
albumin within the venules (Iv) and in the perivenular
interstitial area (Ii) were measured with Image-Pro Plus 5.0
software. Albumin leakage level was presented as Ii/Iv.

Neuron Morphology Evaluation in Nissl Staining
The animals under anesthesia were infused via the left
ventricle with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M PBS (pH 7.4)
at 24 hours after reperfusion. Brains were removed and
postfixed with the same fixative for 48 hours, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in 0.01 M PBS for at least 48 hours at

618

4°C, then embedded in OCT (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA,
USA). The coronal brain slices (10 lm thick) were cut from
the middle between the optic chiasma and the cerebral caudal
end in a cryostat (Leica CM1800, Bensheim, Germany). After
air dried, the sections were processed for either Nissl or
immunohistochemistry staining [28]. To stain Nissl bodies,
cresyl violet acetate (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri, USA)
was used. After immersed in cresyl violet acetate for two
hours at 37°C, the brain slices were conducted successively
dehydration and hyalinization, coverslipped with mounting
medium, and then observed.

TUNEL-Positive Cells Assessment
To evaluate the apoptotic neuron cells in the cortex
penumbral region, TUNEL was conducted using an in situ
cell death detection kit (Fluorescein dUTP Kit; Roche Inc.,
Indianapolis, IN, USA), according to the instruction of
manufacturer. The nuclei were counterstained with hoechst33342 (2 lg/mL) for five minutes. The slices were rinsed
with 0.01 M PBS and coverslipped with mounting medium.
Five fields were selected from the surrounding infarction
areas by a laser confocal microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl
Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The number of TUNEL-positive
nuclei (green) and the total number of nuclei (blue) in each
field were scored, and the ratio of the two values was
automatically calculated with Image-Pro Plus 5.0 software.
The mean ratio of five fields was used for statistic.

MDA Content Determination
MDA is one of the most frequently used biomarkers of lipid
peroxidation [30]. To evaluate the lipid peroxidation level in
brain after MCAO, the MDA concentration assay was
conducted 24 hours after reperfusion, as described previously with some modifications. Briefly, animals were deeply
anesthetized, flushed with freshly made 0.01 M PBS via the
left ventricle. Brains were removed quickly and the ischemic
tissue areas of the ipsilateral hemisphere were carefully
collected, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
80°C until use. Whole cell extracts were performed
followed by the protein concentration measurement using a
Bicinchoninic Acid protein assay kit (Applygen, Beijing,
China). MDA content was then determined with a Rat MDA
ELISA Kit (GBD Ltd., San Diego, CA, USA) in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions.

Western Blot Assay
Western blot analysis (n = 4) was performed as described
previously [21]. Briefly, membrane protein and cytoplasm
protein in brain homogenate were prepared, respectively, for
determination of the expression of NADPH subunits and
PKC, and whole-cell protein was prepared for apoptosisrelated proteins and AMPK/Akt. Protein samples (150 lg)
were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis

120 minutes and transferred to PVDF membrane with
200 mA at 4°C for 120 minutes. Nonspecific binding sites
were blocked by preincubating PVDF membrane with 3%
nonfat milk in TBS-T for 60 minutes at room temperature.
Then, PVDF membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C
with the primary antibodies against GAPDH (1:3000; Cell
Signaling Technology, Vermont, USA), Na+-K+-ATP kinase
(1:200; Santa Cruz Bio technology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
p47phox (1:200; Santa Cruz Bio technology), p67phox (1:1000;

three times, PVDF membranes were incubated with secondary antibody (1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology) for one
hour at room temperature and washed by TBS-T for three
times. Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Applygen). Bands were scanned
and calculated by Bio-Rad Quantity One software (Bio-Rad)

Neurological scores were conducted and are presented in
Figure 1C. The score in I/R group decreased at 24 hours after
reperfusion compared with sham group, while TSI treatment
inhibited the decrease in neurological scores induced by I/R.

TSI Reduces DHR Fluorescence Intensity in the
Cerebral Venular Walls and MDA Content in
Ischemia Cortex
Figure 2A shows the images of DHR fluorescence in all
groups at 24 hours after reperfusion. Stronger fluorescence
intensity was observed in the venular walls of I/R group (a3)
compared with sham group (a1). TSI treatment apparently
attenuated I/R-induced increase in DHR fluorescence intensity in the cerebral venular walls (a4).
The quantitation of DHR fluorescence intensity is presented
in Figure 2B. Compared with sham group, the DHR fluorescence intensity in the venular walls significantly increased at
24 hours after reperfusion. Treatment with TSI significantly
inhibited the increase in DHR fluorescence intensity.
The content of MDA in ischemic cortex detected at
24 hours after reperfusion significantly increased in I/R
group compared with sham group. Treatment with TSI
reduced I/R-increased MDA content (Figure 2C).

The number of leukocytes adhered to the cerebral venular
walls is shown in Figure 3. Compared with sham group (a1),
the number of adhered leukocytes remarkably increased in
I/R group (a3). Treatment with TSI (a4) attenuated I/Relicited enhancement of leukocyte adhesion.
Figure 3B shows the quantitation of leukocyte adhesion.
Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the number of adhered
leukocytes remarkably increased in I/R group, which was
inhibited by treatment with TSI.

TSI Reduces Albumin Leakage from the Cerebral
Venules and Brain Water Content
The images of FITC-labeled albumin leakage from the venules
are exhibited in Figure 4A. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, faint FITC-labeled albumin fluorescence was noted in the
tissue outside the venules in sham group (a1) and sham + TSI
group (a2). In I/R group, the FITC-labeled albumin leakage
from the cerebral venules significantly increased, as noted in
the FITC fluorescence intensity in the perivenular area (a3)
compared with sham group, while TSI treatment remarkably
attenuated the albumin leakage (a4).

The quantitation of the albumin leakage is depicted in
Figure 4B. Compared with sham group, the albumin leakage
at 24 hours after reperfusion significantly increased in I/R
group. The leakage of albumin after I/R was attenuated by
TSI treatment.
The brain water content in different groups is exhibited in
Figure 4C. The water content obviously increased in I/R
group at 24 hours after reperfusion compared with sham
group, while TSI treatment attenuated the brain water
content increase.

TSI Alleviates Neuron Damage in Penumbra
Figure 5 shows the representative images of Nissl staining at
24 hours after reperfusion in all groups. Neurons of sham
group exhibited normal morphological features (a1 and b1),
whereas diverse neuronal damages occurred in I/R group (a3
and b3), such as cell loss, cell swelling, nuclear pyknosis, and
karyorrhexis. TSI treatment partially prevented cell loss and
protected neurons from the injury induced by I/R (a4 and
b4).
The representative images of TUNEL staining conducted
at 24 hours after reperfusion are shown in Figure 6A. The
results revealed that a large number of TUNEL-positive cells

TUNEL-positive cells was significantly reduced in the TSI
treatment group (a4 and b4) compared with I/R group.
The quantitation of the TUNEL-positive cells is presented
in Figure 6B. Compared with sham group, the number of
TUNEL-positive cells at 24 hours after reperfusion significantly increased in I/R group. TSI treatment inhibited the
increase in TUNEL-positive cells induced by I/R.
Figure 6C shows the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved
Caspase-3 detected by western blot at 24 hours after
reperfusion. Compared with sham group, Bcl-2 expression
decreased and cleaved Caspase-3 expression increased in I/R
group, whereas the expression of Bax showed no apparent
difference among the four groups. The decrease in Bcl-2
expression and increase in cleaved Caspase-3 expression
induced by I/R were reversed by TSI treatment.
The quantitation of above proteins expression showed that
the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax decreased (Figure 6G) and cleaved
Caspase-3 expression increased (Figure 6D) in I/R group
compared with sham group at 24 hours after reperfusion.
TSI treatment inhibited the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax decrease and
cleaved Caspase-3 expression increase significantly.

Figure 7A,E illustrates the Western blots showing the
expression of NADPH subunits p47phox /p67phox /gp91phox
in cytosol and membrane, respectively, with the corresponding quantitation analysis showing below (Figure 7B,C,D,F,G,
H). Compared with sham group, the expression of p47phox
and p67phox in I/R group decreased in cytosol, but increased
in membrane at 24 hours after reperfusion. On the other
hand, the expression of gp91phox showed no difference
among the four groups in cytosol in I/R group (Figure 7D),
but increased obviously in I/R group in membrane (Figure 7H) compared with sham group. TSI attenuated the
decrease in NADPH subunits p47phox/p67phox in cytosol
and their increase in cellular membrane.

Western blot was conducted to assess the expression of PKC
in cytosol and membrane, respectively, and the result is
presented in Figure 8A,D. Obviously, the expression of PKC
decreased in cytosol and increased in membrane in I/R group
at 24 hours after reperfusion compared with sham group,
while treatment with TSI inhibited the alteration of PKC
expression induced by I/R. Figure 8B,E showed that the
expression of p-Akt increased in I/R group compared with
sham group at 24 hours after reperfusion, while this increase
was attenuated by TSI treatment, indicating the ability of TSI
to inhibit Akt activation. Akt expression showed no difference among the four groups. Figure 8C,F showed that both

reperfusion in I/R group compared with sham group, and the
ratio of p-AMPK/AMPK changed in the same manner, while
TSI treatment inhibited the decrease induced by I/R,
implying that TSI was able to enhance the expression and
activation of AMPK.

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrated the beneficial role of TSI in the
outcome of rats subjected to I/R-induced injury, as shown by
the reduction in cerebral infarct size and improvement of
neurological scores. As to the mechanisms responsible for the
TSI potential, we observed a relief of cerebral microcirculatory disturbance and a decrease in neuron apoptosis by TSI
treatment, and revealed that TSI was capable of attenuating I/

624

R-induced oxidative stress, particularly, the activation of
NADPH oxidase, an effect involving AMPK/Akt/ PKC
signaling.
As a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine, Salvia
miltiorrhiza and its ingredients have been extensively investigated regarding their protective role in various organs,
including heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs [11], while few
study has been published to address their effect on I/Rinduced brain injury. A work by Lo et al. reported that water
extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza reduces cerebral infarct in
ischemia reperfusion injured rats [22]. Consistent with this
result, this study showed that TSI, an injection consisting of
the major water-soluble components of Salvia miltiorrhiza, is
able to diminish I/R-evoked cerebral infarct as well as
improve neurological scores. This result provided further

evidence supporting the use of TSI as a strategy for treatment
of stroke in clinic. Furthermore, this study put emphasis on
the application of TSI as an adjuvant management of
thrombolysis therapy for the patients presenting as acute
ischemia stroke. We administrated TSI at two minutes before
reperfusion, a time point corresponding the time before
initiation of thrombolysis therapy, with hope that the
observed results are more feasible for clinicians.
The role of TSI in attenuating microcirculatory disturbance and apoptosis is most likely attributable to its
antioxidant potential. Oxidative stress occurs during ischemia and reperfusion due to imbalance between ROS
production and removal by antioxidants. The excessive
ROS causes diverse detrimental sequels. In microvessels, ROS
provokes adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium and
increases permeability of endothelium barrier, leading to
extravasation of macromolecules and perivascular edema.
Excessive ROS also triggers program of apoptosis in both

vessel endothelial cells and neurons. In line with this
prevalent concept, we observed an enhanced leukocyte
adhesion to venular wall, an increased vascular permeability,
and brain water content, as well as emerging of apoptosis
after I/R. Meanwhile, I/R caused an increased fluorescence
intensity in venular walls, indicting occurrence of oxidative
stress. Importantly, TSI treatment attenuated all the insults,
including oxidative stress, highlighting the critical role of the
antioxidant potential of TSI. Salvia miltiorrhiza and its
ingredients have been accepted as a potent antioxidant. On
the other hand, few studies have been published with respect
to the mechanism underlying its antioxidant activity. In an in
vitro study, Zhang and Wang [34] have shown the involvement of suppression of NAD(P)H oxidase in the antioxidant
activity of Salvianolic acid B. We have recently reported that
Cardiotonic Pills, a Chinese medicine containing Salvia
miltiorrhiza as a component, protects I/R-induced heart
injury via inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase [33]. However, the

625

H. Tang et al.

signaling pathway mediating the inhibition of NAD(P)H
oxidase by Salvia miltiorrhiza and its ingredients is so far
unknown.
The new finding of this study is that TSI, in addition to
inhibiting activation of NAD(P)H oxidase, was able to
inhibit Akt and PKC and activate AMPK in the rat brains
that underwent I/R challenge. NADPH oxidase expresses in
different cell types of brain, including leukocyte, vascular
endothelial cells, vascular muscle cells, neurons, and microglia. It is likely that, in response to I/R challenge, the NADPH
oxidases in different cells are all activated and release ROS. In
present circumstance, we cannot discriminate the relative
contribution of the NADPH from different cell types to the
observed result. Nevertheless, the activation of NADPH
oxidase induced by I/R was inhibited by TSI, confirming this
enzyme as a critical, if not sole, target for TSI to attenuate
oxidative stress. Akt and PKC are known as upstream
signalings for the activation of NADPH oxidase by phosphorylating p47phox and/or rac1. Of notice, we observed that
Akt and PKC were inhibited by TSI, suggesting that these two
signalings are implicated in TSI action. On the other hand,
Akt and PKC are known to be regulated by AMPK, an energy
sensor that is sensitive to ROS [24]. Activated AMPK could
inhibit Akt phosphorylation [19] and PKC translocation [4].
In cardiovascular system, studies have shown that AMPK is a
suppressor of NADPH oxidase in physiological condition
[26]. This study showed that AMPK was downregulated in
brain tissue in response to I/R, while NADPH oxidase was
activated. Considering the finding in cardiovascular system,
this result suggests that NADPH oxidase in brain tissue is
negatively regulated by AMPK as well. Interestingly, we
showed that the decreased expression and activity of AMPK
induced by I/R injury was significantly attenuated by
treatment with TSI, suggesting AMPK as a target for TSI
action. Taken together, the evidences of this study highly
suggest that as an antioxidant TSI acts by inhibiting NADPH

oxidase activity via a pathway involving AMPK/AKT/PKC.
More studies are required for elucidation of the details of this
signaling pathway. Particularly, PKC is not a single enzyme,
but a family of enzymes consisting of 10 different isozymes.
Individual PKC isozymes mediate different and sometimes
opposing functions after activation by the same stimulus. In
this regard, beta isotype of PKC is reported to be involved in
the activation of NADPH oxidase. It is still to be clarified
whether or not TSI treatment specifically inhibits beta
isotype of PKC.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that TSI treatment
could protect I/R-induced rat brain injury, which most likely
attributes to inhibiting NADPH oxidase via a mechanism
involving AMPK/Akt/PKC pathway, thus preventing oxidative stress to occur. This result provides support for the use
of TSI as an adjuvant management for patients with acute
ischemic stroke, and sheds light on better understanding the
rationale behind the antioxidant potential of TSI.

PERSPECTIVE
For the patients with acute ischemic stroke, the currently used
thrombolysis, though effective, may cause reperfusion injury,
leading to a range of detrimental consequences. This study
demonstrated that TSI administration before reperfusion
could attenuate I/R-induced microcirculatory disturbance
and neuron damage. This finding provides an experimental
basis for clinical use of TSI to improve the outcome of
patients who are subjected to thrombolytic intervention.
