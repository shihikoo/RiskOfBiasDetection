Abstract
Background: In this study, the neuroprotective effect of a novel nonpeptide AT2R agonist, C21, was examined in a
conscious model of stroke to verify a class effect of AT2R agonists as neuroprotective agents.
Methods and Results: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were pre-treated for 5 days prior to stroke with C21 alone or
in combination with the AT2R antagonist PD123319. In a separate series of experiments C21 was administered in a series of
4 doses commencing 6 hours after stroke. A focal reperfusion model of ischemia was induced in conscious SHR by
administering endothelin-1 to the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Motor coordination was assessed at 1 and 3 days after
stroke and post mortem analyses of infarct volumes, microglia activation and neuronal survival were performed at 72 hours
post MCA occlusion. When given prior to stroke, C21 dose dependently decreased infarct volume, which is consistent with
the behavioural findings illustrating an improvement in motor deficit. During the pre-treatment protocol C21 was shown to
enhance microglia activation, which are likely to be evoking protection by releasing brain derived neurotrophic factor.
When drug administration was delayed until 6 hours after stroke, C21 still reduced brain injury.
Conclusion: These results indicate that centrally administered C21 confers neuroprotection against stroke damage. This
benefit is likely to involve various mechanisms, including microglial activation of endogenous repair and enhanced
cerebroperfusion. Thus, we have confirmed the neuroprotective effect of AT2R stimulation using a nonpeptide compound
which highlights the clinical potential of the AT2R agonists for future development.

In the context of stroke, treatment with an ARB will minimise
the extent of tissue damage and degree of behavioural impairment
caused by experimentally induced stroke [6–8]. Interestingly,
during AT1R blockade, the actions of the AT2R are unmasked,
with indirect evidence highlighting an AT2R mediated protective
influence on neurons. In fact, the stroke protection elicited by the
ARBs seems to be entirely attributed to increased activation of the
AT2R, as the therapeutic benefit is completely reversed when the
AT2R is simultaneously blocked using the AT2R antagonist,
PD123319 [4,6,9,10]. Consistent with this, mice lacking the AT2R
exhibit poorer stroke outcome and impaired sensitivity to the
protective actions of the ARBs, again illustrating the crucial role
the AT2R has in reducing stroke damage [11].
Recently, we directly examined the neuroprotective effects of
the AT2R in a rat model of stroke using the agonist, CGP42112
[12,13]. Central administration of CGP42112 produced a dose
dependant reduction in infarct volume and dramatically decreased
the resulting functional deficits following middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) [12,13]. Interestingly, the benefit evoked by

Introduction
It is becoming increasingly evident that modulation of the reninangiotensin system (RAS) can be protective against the damaging
effects of stroke. Specifically, angiotensin II type 1 receptor
blockers (ARBs), which are most commonly used to treat
hypertension, have unique mechanisms of action that provide
benefit beyond simply the control of blood pressure [1,2].
Angiotensin II (Ang II) is the main effector hormone of the RAS
that has the ability to interact with different receptor subtypes to
elicit a range of physiological events. The most abundant of the
Ang II receptors is the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R),
responsible for most of the physiological and pathological events
classically associated with Ang II [3]. The angiotensin II type 2
receptor (AT2R) is more sparsely expressed in adult tissue and
therefore is often silenced by the dominant AT1R. However, in
certain disease settings, including stroke, AT2R expression is upregulated, suggesting that it may be involved in the body’s
endogenous response to injury [4–6].

model 2 ML2) or was left exposed to allow a bolus dose of drug to
be administered at 4 time points after stroke. The animals were
housed individually and were allowed a 5-day recovery period
prior to the induction of stroke.

CGP42112 was not only evident when AT2R stimulation
occurred prior to stroke induction [13], but the level of protection
was similar when commencement of treatment was delayed until 6
hours after ischemia [12]. These investigations were the first direct
illustration of stroke protective actions of the AT2R. However,
while CGP42112 provides proof of principal of AT2R mediated
neuroprotection, this peptide is easily metabolised and unlikely to
cross the blood brain barrier, which renders it unsuitable for use in
humans.
A selective nonpeptide AT2R agonist, C21 (also known as
M024), has been developed [14] which produces a similar effect to
CGP42112 on blood pressure [15] and improves cardiac function
following myocardial infarction [16]. The AT2R agonist C21 is
similar in size and structure to the nonpeptide AT1R antagonists
(ARBs) in clinic and is highly selective for the AT2R, reported to
be anywhere from ,4,000-fold [17] to 25,000-fold [14] selective
for AT2R over AT1R. In the setting of stroke, although not
specifically assessing brain injury, Gelosa et al., found that oral
administration of C21 delayed brain damage and extended life
expectancy in stroke-prone hypertensive rats on a high sodium diet
[18]. In light of our research illustrating the protective actions of
the AT2R during cerebral ischemia, the aim of the current study
was to examine whether the same degree of neuroprotection can
be induced using the novel drug-like agonist C21, which is more
clinically relevant than the previously studied peptide agonist
CGP42112.

Ethics Statement
These studies were approved by a Monash University Animal
Ethics Committee (Application number; MARP/2011/091).

Treatments
Pre-stroke treatment. The animals were randomly allocated to one of several treatment groups: AT2R agonist C21 at doses
(5, 10 or 50 ng/kg/min) (n = 8, 11, 15 respectively); C21 (50 ng/
kg/min) in combination with AT2R antagonist PD123319 (36 ng/
kg/min) (n = 11); PD123319 alone (36 ng/kg/min) (n = 12) and
vehicle (saline) only control (n = 13). C21 has been shown to have
approximately 10-fold less affinity at the AT2R compared to the
classic agonist CGP42112, therefore the doses of C21 used in the
concentration-response curve were derived from the dose of
CGP42112 that we have previously reported to be neuroprotective13. Additionally, we have confirmed that PD123319 given
centrally at a dose of 36 ng/kg/min will effectively block the stroke
protective effects CGP42112 [12,13], therefore the same dose of
PD123319 was used in the current study.
Post-stroke treatment. The dose of C21 was derived from
the pre-treatment series of experiments described above; the same
cumulative amount of C21 at the highest dose tested (50 ng/kg/
min for 8 days) was administered over 4 bolus injections performed
after stroke induction. Rats were allocated to either C21 (144 mg/
kg/dose) (n = 11); C21 (144 mg/kg/dose)+PD123319 (103 mg/kg/
dose) (n = 6); PD123319 alone (103 mg\kg\dose) (n = 12) or
vehicle (saline) control (n = 12). All drugs were administered at 4
time points after stroke: 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours post stroke and
were administered via a previously implanted guide cannula
directly into the left lateral ventricle using a 30-gauge injector
protruding 3 mm beyond the end of the guide cannula. All drugs
were dissolved in saline and infused in a volume of 3 ml over 3
minutes.

Methods
Surgical Procedures
Cannulae implantation. The guide cannula to be used
during endothelin-1 (ET-1) titration was stereotaxially inserted
according to methodology outlined by Sharkey et al,. [19]. Male
spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) (330–350 g) were anaesthetised with ketamine (75 mg/kg; Sigma)/xylazine (10 mg/kg;
Troy; i.p). A 23-gauge stainless steel guide cannula was
stereotaxically implanted to sit 3 mm dorsal to the right middle
cerebral artery in the piriform cortex. The stereotaxic coordinates
were modified for the SHR strain of rat (0.2 mm anterior, 2
4.7 mm lateral, and 27 mm ventral relative to Bregma) [12,13].
An additional cannula was implanted into the left lateral ventricle
(20.8 mm anterior, +1.5 mm lateral, and 23.2 mm ventral
relative to Bregma) which was either attached to a drug filled
subcutaneous minipump to allow drug to be continuously
administered for 5 days prior to and 3 days after stroke (Alzet

Systolic Blood Pressure Measurement
Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured using a noninvasive tail-cuff blood pressure analysis system (Model MC400,
Hatteras Instruments) 6 days prior to stroke and at 72 hours poststroke. Animals were placed on a heated platform and held in a
restrainer during pressure detection. 1 day prior to the initial

measurement of SBP animals were habituated to the restrainer
and an average of at least 4–5 determinants were calculated.

Assessment of Functional Outcome
Motor co-ordination abnormalities were examined by assessing
the animals dependence on the under-hanging wider ledge of a
gradually narrowing beam as previously described [12,13]. Naı̈ve
rats are able to traverse the central portion of the beam without
using the underhanging ledges for support. Rats that have had a
stroke use the ledge for support on the impaired side and take
more steps on the ledge. Animals were trained to traverse the
beam on the day prior to the surgical implantation of the cannalae.
The ledged beam test was conducted immediately before stroke
induction, at 24 hours (day 1) and ,70 hours after stroke
induction (day 3). The number of steps taken on the lower ledge
(errors) by each foot was recorded and expressed as a percentage
of the total number of footsteps taken and recorded as percentage
error. All values were compared to pre-stroke performance,
therefore each rat acted as its own control. It should be noted that
the assessment of motor function at 24 hours post stroke occurred
prior to the second injection of drug in the delayed treatment
protocol.

Stroke Induction
During stroke induction, animals were placed in a clear Perspex
box to allow observation. Stroke was induced in conscious animals
by inserting a 30-gauge injector protruding 3 mm below the end of
the previously implanted guide cannula and endothelin-1 (ET-1)
(20pmol/ml in saline; AusPep) was injected at a rate of 0.2 ul every
30 seconds until the animal exhibited behavioural changes
associated with the desired level of stroke. Typical behaviours
that were observed were continuous contralateral and ipsilateral
circling; clenching, dragging, or failure to extend the forelimb
contralateral to the side of ET-1 infusion; chewing and jaw flexing
and shuffling with forepaws [12,13]. Each stroke was graded based
on these pre-determined behavioural changes using a scale of 1–4,
with 1 being a mild stroke and 4 being a severe stroke. Only rats
with a grade 4 level of stroke, exhibiting at least 5 of the
aforementioned behaviours, were used for the purpose of this
investigation. Out of the 139 animals stroked in this study, 1
animal was excluded because it did not reach the appropriate level
of stroke. In addition, 17 animals were excluded because they had
a stroke that was greater than a level 4 stroke. All excluded animals
were humanely sacrificed immediately after the final injection of
ET-1. The experimenter was blinded to all treatments in these
studies.

Quantification of Ischemic Damage
At 72 hours after stroke rats were re-anaesthetised with
ketamine (75 mg/kg; Sigma)/xylazine (10 mg/kg; Troy) and
transcardially perfused with physiologically buffered saline
(0.1 M PBS; pH 7.4) at a rate of 25 ml per minute. Brains were
then removed, snap frozen and sectioned for image analysis using

the ballistic light method first developed by Callaway and
colleagues [20].

Flow Cytometric Characterisation of Microglia
To identify a possible role of the AT2R in modulating
microglial function, a separate group of untreated SHR were
used to characterise the relationship between microglial AT2R
expression and the release of the neuroprotective cytokine that has
previously been associated with the AT2R [23], brain derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Brains were removed from sham
(n = 7) and stroked (n = 9) rats at 72 hours post-stroke and
enzymatically digested using collagenase type IX (125 U/mL),
hyaluronidase IS (60 U/mL) and collagenase type IS (450 U/mL)
dissolved in PBS containing calcium and magnesium for 30
minutes at 37uC. Digested samples were then passed through a
70 mm filter (Falcon; BR Biosciences) to yield a single-cell
suspension. Leukocytes were then isolated from the cell suspension
using a discontinuous percoll gradient centrifugation (30%/37%/
70% isotonic percoll; GE Healthcare) for 25 minutes at room
temperature at a speed of 2700 RPM. Leukocytes were then
removed from the 37%/70% interface and washed with PBS and
stained for surface markers for leukocytes (PE Cy7 anti-CD45
(OX1); Biolegend) and myeloid cells which include microglia and
macrophages (APC anti-OX42; Biolegend). Cells were washed
with staining buffer (0.5% BSA in PBS) then fixed and
permeabilized and stained with primary antibodies that were
specific for the AT2R (rabbit anti-AT2R; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and BDNF (goat anti-BDNF; Lifespan Biosciences). Cells
were then washed with staining buffer and stained with
fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat-anti rabbit
Alexa488 and donkey anti-goat Qdot605; Life Technologies).
After a final wash cells were then analysed on a LSR II flow

Immunohistochemical Staining
Neuronal expression was assessed using a neuron-specific
marker, NeuN antibody (1:500 dilution, Chemicon), which is a
DNA binding protein that will bind to the nucleus of neurons.
Activated microglia and brain macrophages were observed using
the CD11b antibody (1:1000 dilution, Serotec) which is commonly
known as OX42 and used to visualise activated microglia [21,22].
Frozen coronal cryostat sections (16 mm) were post-fixed in
paraformaldehyde (4%). Slides were incubated overnight with
either the NeuN or OX42 antibody at 4uC. Sections were then
incubated at room temperature with a fluorescence labelled
secondary antibody, Alexa 488 (1:500 dilution, Invitrogen). The
number of immuno-positive cells were counted within a 1 mm2
site for the NeuN antibody and a 0.5 mm2 site for the OX42immuno staining in the infarcted region of the ipsilateral
hemisphere. Ballistic light images from consecutive sections for
each individual rat were used to locate the infarct and non-infarct
regions in which cell counts were conducted. As a control, the
number of immuno-positive cells in the identical region in the
contralateral hemisphere was also counted. In addition, the
number of immuno-positive cells in within the non-infarcted
region of the ipsilateral hemisphere and matched region on the
contralateral hemisphere was also calculated.

tion to KPSS). Following wash out, rings were again contracted
sub-maximally (50–60% of contraction to KPSS) with U46619.
Once contractions were stable, rings were exposed to cumulative
doses of either C21 (10 nmolL –1 mmol/L) or saline (time control).
In some experiments, rings were pre-treated with the AT2 receptor
antagonist PD123319 (10 mmol/L) for 30 min prior to addition of
C21. At the conclusion of each experiment, rings were exposed to
papaverine (100 mmol/L) to ensure maximal relaxation could be
achieved.

To assess the effect of C21 on cerebral artery tone, basilar
arteries were excised from SHR (n = 6) and placed in cold,

(composition, in mmol/L; NaCl 118, KCl 4.5, MgSO4 0.45,
KH2PO4 1.03, NaHCO3 25, glucose 11.1, CaCl2 2.5). Arteries
were cut into two 5 mm rings. Ring segments were then threaded
onto two wires, mounted in a Mulvany-Halpern myograph
(Danish Myo Technology A/S), and resting tension was increased
to either 5 mN. After an equilibration period of 30 min, rings were
exposed to a high potassium physiological salt solution (KPSS)
containing 122.7 mmol/L KCl (equimolar replacement of NaCl
with KCl) to induce vascular contraction defined as ‘100% of

reversed the C21 treatment effect, while having no effect on %
error when administered alone. When treatment was delayed to
commence 6 hours after MCAO, there was no improvement in

to the fact that the degree of motor deficit induced by stroke in the
vehicle-treated group was relatively modest (Fig. 3B).

was considered to be statistically significant; all statistical analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad software).

Results
Systolic Blood Pressure
There was no significant difference in SBP between any of the
treatment groups indicating that C21 did not significantly alter
SBP in either treatment protocol (Table 1).

Neuronal Survival
Infarct Area

Following both treatment protocols, the number of neurons as
detected by NeuN-immuno-positive staining was significantly
lower in the infarct area (pre-treatment: 58.86632.15; delayed
treatment: 53.25622.45 NeuN-positive cells per mm2) compared
to a non-infarcted region within the ipsilateral hemisphere (pretreatment; 154.90626.44, delayed treatment; 173.50623.97
NeuN-positive cells per mm2) of the vehicle-control animals.
When administered prior to stroke, C21 significantly attenuated
the loss of neurons in the ischemic tissue, such that the number of
NeuN-positive cells in the infarcted region was comparable to the
number of NeuN-positive cells in the unaffected area
(153.10617.23; 181.50614.48 NeuN-positive cells per mm2
respectively. P,0.05 vs. corresponding region in vehicle;
Fig. 4A). The same preservation of neuronal cells was evident
when C21 was given 6 hours after stroke (non-infarcted:
188.80623.97; infarcted: 185.4069.64 NeuN-positive cells per
mm2; P,0.05 vs. corresponding region in the vehicle; Fig. 4B).
Furthermore, in accordance with the functional and histological
data, the conservation of neurons seen in the C21-treated animals
was ameliorated when PD123319 was simultaneously administered.

Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of C21 at the
highest dose (50 ng/kg/min) for 5 days prior to and 3 days poststroke significantly reduced cortical infarct volume measured 72
hours after MCAO compared to vehicle (21.5267.92 mm3;
81.14616.93 mm3 respectively; P,0.05 vs. vehicle; Fig. 1). There
was also a trend for C21 to decrease striatal infarct volume but this
did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, when treatment
with C21 was delayed to commence 6 hours after stroke, both
cortical and striatal infarct volumes were significantly reduced in
the animals receiving C21 (cortical: 19.2067.58 mm3; striatal:
14.3665.50 mm3) compared to vehicle-treated SHR (cortical:
89.36614.54 mm3; striatal: 36.6965.08 mm3; P,0.05, Fig. 2).
Regardless of the drug administration regime, the stroke
protection afforded by C21 was attenuated by co-administration
of the AT2R antagonist PD123319 while PD123319 itself had no
effect when administered alone.

Motor Deficit
Motor deficits were increased at both 1 and 3 days after stroke
in the vehicle-treated SHR, with the severity of deficit being most
pronounced 1 day after stroke in the control group in the pretreatment series of experiments (47615% error; Fig. 3A). The
highest dose of C21 (50 ng/kg/min) administered prior to stroke
significantly reduced the severity of motor deficit at 1 day after
stroke (864% error; P,0.01 vs. corresponding time point in
vehicle-treated group) when compared to matched vehicle-control.

Microglial Activation
Stroke increased the number of activated microglial, including
brain macrophages, in the damaged tissue of the ipsilateral
hemisphere. There was negligible microglial activation in the
contralateral hemisphere (data not shown). Moreover, there was a
significant increase in the number of activated microglia in the

were also positive for BDNF (Fig. 7). Moreover, this phenotype
was not altered by stroke since, in both sham and stroked rats, the
predominant proportion (,75%) of BDNF-producing cells were
also AT2R-positive (Fig. 7).

Vascular Reactivity
The acute effect of C21 in the absence and presence of AT2R
block was examined to establish whether enhanced cerebral blood
flow may be a component of the C21-treatment effect. ACh
(10 mmol/L) elicited similar relaxation responses in basilar arteries
in C21-treated and C21+ PD123319 treated arteries (9762%; and
94613%, respectively) indicating a functional endothelium.
Furthermore, the level of pre-contraction induced by the
thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619 was similar between these
two groups (C21:5065% max and C21+ PD123319:4465% max,
respectively). C21 elicited concentration-dependent (10 nmolL –
1 mmol/L) relaxations of basilar arteries, with a maximal effect at
1 mmol/L (Rmax: 60612% of maximal relaxation to papaverine;
Fig. 8). Moreover, relaxation responses to C21 were significantly
attenuated in the presence of PD123319 (Rmax: 1964%, P,0.05)
and were comparable to those arteries not exposed to C21 (Rmax:
966%).

Discussion
The major finding of this investigation is that central
administration of novel non-peptide AT2R agonist, C21, protected neuronal tissue from ischaemic damage regardless of the timing
of administration, such that the therapeutic benefit persisted even
when treatment was delayed until 6 hours after stroke induction.
The involvement of the AT2R in the stroke protection, despite
relatively high local drug concentrations, was confirmed by
reversal of the C21-treatment effect using the AT2R antagonist
PD123319.
Using a conscious model of MCAO in SHR we showed that
i.c.v. administration of C21, in a pre- or post-stroke treatment
regime, reduced the severity of tissue damage independent of any
changes in blood pressure. Although the gross measurement of
infarct volume and the evaluation of tissue architecture both
indicate that delaying treatment with C21 until after stroke was
neuroprotective, there was only a modest improvement in
behavioural performance. However, the control animals did not
exhibit the same level of motor impairment as in the pre-treatment
series of experiments, which may partly account for the lack of a
statistically significant post-treatment behavioural effect. On this
point, the C21-treated animals had only received a single dose of
drug (25% of total dose) when the 24 hour behavioural assessment
was performed, which may also account for the lack of a significant
improvement in motor performance.
The evaluation of the tissue architecture using a neuronal
marker (NeuN) indicates that ET-1 induced MCA occlusion
caused a dramatic reduction in the number of viable neurons in
the area of tissue directly affected by stroke. This loss of NeuNpositive cells was reversed by C21 during both drug administration
protocols resulting in neuronal expression in ischemic tissue being
similar to that seen in the unaffected cortex of the same
hemisphere. While we have seen analogous AT2R-mediated
preservation of neurons using CGP42112 [12], this is the first
evidence that the novel agonist C21 can prevent neuronal loss to
the same extent. Although a direct neuroprotective effect of AT2R
stimulation was evident, an additional vasodilator role may also
contribute to C21-treatment effect by augmenting cerebral blood
flow and enhancing collateral circulation. It is well accepted that
AT2R stimulation, including studies using C21 [15], evokes

Microglial BDNF-AT2R Interaction
To determine a possible involvement of the AT2R in promoting
microglial release of BDNF, a neuroprotective cytokine, microglia
cells were isolated 3 days after stroke and analysed using flow
cytometry (Fig. 7). OX42+ cells were gated from the total CD45+
population in order to locate brain microglia within the total
population of leukocytes isolated from brains. To differentiate
between microglia and macrophages, CD45loOX42+ cells were
identified as microglia. AT2R were localised on a small population
of microglia and the majority of these AT2R-positive microglia

vasorelaxation [25]. In the current study, we have shown for the
first time that C21 caused marked relaxation of isolated basilar
arteries of SHR in a PD123319-sensitive manner, which may
translate to in vivo cerebral vasodilation. However, while it is
acknowledged that this in vitro analysis needs confirmation
in vivo, these initial findings are in agreement with the recent
report that AT2R stimulation accelerates the return of cerebral

blood flow during reperfusion in the filament MCAO model of
stroke [26].
Microglia are a dynamic cell population that will undergo
morphological changes in response to various environmental
triggers [27]. It has recently been established that microglia can
polarise to exert opposing actions on surrounding neurons
depending on whether an injurious or reparative phenotype is
adopted [28], [29]. The conflicting views regarding the influence
of microglia during injury is likely a reflection of the plasticity of
these cells to polarise based on the stimuli from the local
microenvironment.
In the current study, pre-treatment with C21 elevated the
number of activated microglia in the core and peri-infarct regions
of the ipsilateral hemisphere, which coincides with a smaller lesion
area and increased neuronal survival at 3 days after stroke. In fact,
augmented microglia activity appears to be a common effect of the
AT2R agonists, as CGP42112-treatment produced a similar
change [12]. Furthermore, there seems to be a direct relationship
between the level of microglial activation and behavioural
outcomes in the C21-treated animals, since both motor function
and the number of OX42-positive cells were increased in the pretreatment protocol, but not when treatment was delayed. Indeed,
there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that microglia
promote neuronal survival by potentiating the release of various
growth factors and cytokines that accelerate wound healing,
including BDNF [30], interleurkin-10 and transforming growth
factor-b [31,32]. Furthermore, the viability and growth of primary
neuronal cultures, in both normal and hypoxic conditions, is
enhanced when co-cultured with microglia [28].

Novel AT2R Agonist, Compound 21, Reduces Stroke Damage

To evaluate the relationship between the AT2R and the release
of trophic cytokines, we examined microglial AT2R expression
and correlated this with BDNF release. Flow cytometric analysis,
in contrast to immunohistochemistry, was employed to allow the
simultaneous assessment of the relative expression of the AT2R
and BDNF on OX42+CD45lo cells that were specifically identified
as microglia. This methodological approach provided high
resolution quantitative data that highlighted a potential functional
difference between AT2R negative and AT2R positive cells.
Interestingly, although the AT2R is only sparsely expressed across
the total population of microglia, they are abundantly expressed
on the cells that produce BDNF, and this phenotype is preserved
in stroke, which implies a specific involvement of the AT2R in this
cell population. Moreover, the reduction in stroke damage and
concomitant increase in microglia activation in the C21-treated
animals may indicate that direct activation of AT2R maintains the
equilibrium between the neurotrophic and pro-inflammatory
microglia. It is tempting to suggest that, when given as a pretreatment, C21 prevented the detrimental polarising effects of
stroke by enhancing the actions of the AT2R-positive-BDNFproducing microglia. In contrast, the lack of behavioural
improvement and the absence of a change in the number of
OX42-positive cells when C21 was given after stroke may be due
to the fact that the microglia had already started to undergo
polarisation at the time of drug administration. While further
confirmation is required, the current results indicate that
harnessing the protective influence of microglia may be a
component of the beneficial effects mediated via the AT2R.
Indeed, BDNF which acts to promote neuronal repair, has been

indirectly associated with activation of the AT2R. Various groups
have documented a PD123319-reversible increase in BDNF
production [23] and BDNF receptor (TrkA) expression [33] in
the neuronal tissue of candesartan-treated SHRs. More recently,
C21 enhanced BDNF production in neuronal cells in vitro, which
is again suggestive of a role for BDNF in AT2R signalling [34].
In conclusion, there are likely to be a number of mechanisms
contributing to the neuroprotective effects seen in the present
study. We have demonstrated that C21 is neuroprotective during
stroke, not only when given prior to stroke, but of greater clinical
significance, when treatment is delayed until 6 hours after stroke.
The current findings are consistent with our previous reports
which show that the AT2R agonist, CGP42112 [12,13], protects
neuronal tissue, reduces apoptosis and preserves motor function
following cerebral ischemia. In fact, the analogous stroke
protection afforded by structurally unrelated compounds,
CGP42112 and C21, suggests that neuroprotection is a class
effect of AT2R agonists. In addition, the current findings indicate
that the release of trophic cytokines by microglia and enhanced
vasodilatation are likely to be contributing factors. These findings
firmly establish the AT2R as an important target for the
development of more effective treatments for stroke.
