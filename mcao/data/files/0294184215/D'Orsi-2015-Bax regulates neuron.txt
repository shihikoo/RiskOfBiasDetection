Excessive Ca 2⫹ entry during glutamate receptor overactivation (“excitotoxicity”) induces acute or delayed neuronal death. We report
here that deficiency in bax exerted broad neuroprotection against excitotoxic injury and oxygen/glucose deprivation in mouse neocortical neuron cultures and reduced infarct size, necrotic injury, and cerebral edema formation after middle cerebral artery occlusion in
mice. Neuronal Ca 2⫹ and mitochondrial membrane potential (⌬␺m ) analysis during excitotoxic injury revealed that bax-deficient
neurons showed significantly reduced Ca 2⫹ transients during the NMDA excitation period and did not exhibit the deregulation of ⌬␺m
that was observed in their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Reintroduction of bax or a bax mutant incapable of proapoptotic oligomerization
equally restored neuronal Ca 2⫹ dynamics during NMDA excitation, suggesting that Bax controlled Ca 2⫹ signaling independently of its
role in apoptosis execution. Quantitative confocal imaging of intracellular ATP or mitochondrial Ca 2⫹ levels using FRET-based sensors
indicated that the effects of bax deficiency on Ca 2⫹ handling were not due to enhanced cellular bioenergetics or increased Ca 2⫹ uptake
into mitochondria. We also observed that mitochondria isolated from WT or bax-deficient cells similarly underwent Ca 2⫹-induced
permeability transition. However, when Ca 2⫹ uptake into the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum was blocked with the Ca 2⫹-ATPase inhibitor
thapsigargin, bax-deficient neurons showed strongly elevated cytosolic Ca 2⫹ levels during NMDA excitation, suggesting that the ability
of Bax to support dynamic ER Ca 2⫹ handling is critical for cell death signaling during periods of neuronal overexcitation.

Introduction
Overactivation of glutamate receptors (“excitotoxicity’) has been
implicated in stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s disease,
and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Foyouzi-Youssefi et al., 2000,
Mattson, 2007, Hardingham and Bading, 2010). Depending on
duration and severity, excitotoxic injury induces necrotic or apoptotic cell death (Ankarcrona et al., 1995, Lankiewicz et al.,
2000, Ward et al., 2007, D’Orsi et al., 2012), although other forms
of cell death, such as necroptosis and parthanatos, have also been
reported (Cregan et al., 2002, Yu et al., 2002, Wang et al., 2004b,
Andrabi et al., 2008, Yuan and Kroemer, 2010). In all instances,

Ca 2⫹-permeable AMPA receptors is the initial cell death trigger
(Choi, 1987, Hardingham and Bading, 2010).
The proapoptotic bax gene is a key mediator of apoptotic cell
death in neurons (Deckwerth et al., 1996, Vekrellis et al., 1997,
Cregan et al., 1999, Putcha et al., 1999). Bax is normally localized
in the cytosol or loosely attached to the mitochondria. Upon a
variety of apoptotic stimuli, Bax undergoes conformational changes,
leading to its translocation, oligomerization, and insertion into the
outer mitochondrial membrane (Youle and Strasser, 2008).
Bax oligomerization initiates outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and promotes caspase-dependent or
-independent apoptosis (Hsu et al., 1997, Goping et al., 1998, De
Giorgi et al., 2002, Youle and Strasser, 2008, Galluzzi et al., 2009).
Neurons deficient in bax have been shown to be protected from
growth factor withdrawal-, denervation-, proteotoxic-, and oxidative stress-induced neuronal injury (Xiang et al., 1998, Li et al.,
2004, Siu and Alway, 2006, Steckley et al., 2007). We and others
have shown that deletion of bax is also protective against excitotoxic apoptosis (Chang et al., 2004, Sánchez-Gómez et al., 2011,
D’Orsi et al., 2012). Although excitotoxic necrosis leads to an
immediate loss of neuronal ion and energy homeostasis, excitotoxic apoptosis is characterized by an initial recovery of both,
followed by mitochondrial cell death engagement (Ankarcrona et
al., 1995, Bonfoco et al., 1995, Luetjens et al., 2000, Ward et al.,
2007, D’Orsi et al., 2012). This mode of cell death is characterized
by a release of apoptosis-inducing factor, activation of calpain
and Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and initiation of predominantly caspase-independent cell death pathways (Lankiewicz et
al., 2000, Cao et al., 2007, Norberg et al., 2008).

Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that Bcl-2 family proteins, apart from their role in regulating apoptosis, are vital for
the regulation of mitochondrial function, bioenergetics, and
Ca 2⫹ handling (Pinton et al., 2000, Scorrano et al., 2003, Chen
and Dickman, 2004, Wei et al., 2004, Johnson et al., 2005, Oakes
et al., 2005, White et al., 2005, Pinton and Rizzuto, 2006, Sheridan
et al., 2008). Indeed, it has been suggested that these activities may
represent their “daytime” function (Kilbride and Prehn, 2013).
Here, we provide evidence that the proapoptotic Bax protein
plays a key role in the regulation of neuronal Ca 2⫹ homeostasis
and through this activity controls cell death pathways upstream
and in addition to its role in the mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Fetal bovine serum, horse serum, minimal essential medium (MEM),
B27 supplemented neurobasal medium, tetramethylrhodamine methyl
ester (TMRM), Fluo-4 AM (acetoxymethyl), and Fura-2 AM were from
Invitrogen. All other chemicals, including NMDA, MK-801, and thapsigargin, came in analytical grade purity from Sigma-Aldrich.

Gene-targeted mice

The generation and genotyping of bax ⫺ / ⫺ mice has been described previously (D’Orsi et al., 2012). Several pairs of heterozygous breeder pairs
of bax-deficient mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and
maintained in-house. The genotype of bax ⫺ / ⫺ mice was confirmed by
PCR, as described by The Jackson Laboratory. The bax ⫺ / ⫺ mice were
originally generated on a mixed C57BL/6x129SV genetic background
using 129SV-derived ES cells, but had been backcrossed for ⬎12 generations onto the C57BL/6 background. As controls, WT mice were used
for all experiments. DNA was extracted from tail snips using the High
Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit (Roche). Genotyping was performed using three specific primers: 5⬘GTTGACCAGAGTGGCGTAGG3⬘ (common), 5⬘GAGCTGATCAGAACCATCATG3⬘ (wild-type
[WT] allele specific), and 5⬘CCGCTTCCATTGCTCAGCGG3⬘ (mutant
allele specific). All animal work was performed with ethics approval and
under licenses granted by the Irish Department of Health and Children.
Procedures were reviewed and approved by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland Research Ethics Committee.

penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at
37°C in humidified atmosphere with 5% of CO2.

Cerebral ischemia–transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was performed as
described previously (Gröger et al., 2005). Briefly, bax-deficient (body
weight ⫽ 24.4 ⫾ 0.4 g) and WT (body weight ⫽ 26.6 ⫾ 1.3 g) control
mice were initially anesthetized with 5% isoflurane, 30% O2, and 65%
N2O and maintained with 2% isoflurane, 33% O2, and 65% N2O for the
duration of surgery. Body temperature was maintained at 36.8 –37.4°C
with a feedback-controlled heating pad (Heater Control Module; FHC).
A flexible laser-Doppler probe (5001 Master; Perimed) was glued onto
the exposed left parietal skull over the territory of the MCA for continuous monitoring of regional cerebral blood flow. Thereafter, the left common and external carotid arteries were exposed and ligated. The
common carotid artery was incised and a silicone-coated 8-0 nylon
monofilament was inserted into the internal carotid artery and advanced
until the laser-Doppler signal indicated occlusion of the MCA using an
operative microscope. Laser-Doppler flow during occlusion was 8.55 ⫾
0.84% and 9.75 ⫾ 0.93% of baseline in WT and bax ⫺ / ⫺ mice, respectively, indicating ischemic blood flow conditions in this area in both
mouse strains. Wounds were sutured and mice were incubated at 34°C
and allowed to wake up. Sixty minutes after MCAO, mice were shortly
reanesthetized and ischemia was terminated by the removal of the intraluminal silicon-coated suture.

Histological analysis of ischemic neuronal injury

Primary cultures of cortical neurons were prepared from embryonic gestation day 16 –18 (E16-E18) (D’Orsi et al., 2012). To isolate the cortical
neurons, hysterectomies of pregnant female mice were performed after
euthanizing mice by cervical dislocation. The cerebral cortices were isolated from each embryo and pooled in a dissection medium on ice (PBS
with 0.25% glucose, 0.3% BSA). The tissue was incubated with 0.25%
trypsin-EDTA at 37°C for 15 min. After the incubation, the trypsinization was stopped by the addition of fresh plating medium (MEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 100 U/ml penicillin/
streptomycin (Pen/Strep), 0.5 mM L-glutamine, and 0.6% D-glucose. The
neurons were then dissociated by gentle pipetting and, after centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 3 minutes, the medium containing trypsin was
aspirated. Neocortical neurons were resuspended in plating medium,
plated at 2 ⫻ 10 5 cells per cm 2 on poly-D-lysine-coated plates (final
concentration of 5 ␮g/ml), and then incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. The
plating medium was exchanged with 50% feeding medium (NBMembryonic containing 100 U/ml Pen/Strep, 2% B27, and 0.5 mM
L-glutamine), 50% plating medium with additional mitotic inhibitor cytosine arabinofuranoside (600 nM). Two days later, the medium was
again exchanged for complete feeding medium. All experiments were
performed on days in vitro (DIV) 8 –11.

For quantification of neurological deficit score and infarct area/volume,
WT (n ⫽ 6) and bax ⫺ / ⫺ mice (n ⫽ 8) were killed 24 h after reperfusion.
Brain samples were frozen on dry ice and stored in ⫺20°C. Tenmicrometer coronal sections (n ⫽ 14) from each brain were cut with a
CM1950 Cryostat (Leica Biosystems) and taken at 500 ␮m intervals.
Sections were stained with cresyl violet/Nissl and infarct area was quantified using an image analysis system (Leica Application Suite V3). Lesion
volume was calculated as described previously by Gröger et al. (2005).
Data are expressed as percentage of contralateral hemisphere to correct
for differences in brain size and brain edema. Mice subjected to tMCAO
were evaluated for neurologic deficit on a 5-point scale after 24 h of
reperfusion (0 ⫽ no deficit; 1 ⫽ forelimb weakness; 2 ⫽ circling to the
affected side; 3 ⫽ loss of reflex; and 4 ⫽ no spontaneous motor activity;
Plesnila et al., 2001). To determine the plasticity of the bilateral posterior
communicating artery (PcomA) in WT and bax ⫺ / ⫺ mice, four mice of
each genotype were perfused with ice-cold saline followed by cresyl violet
solution. Next, the brains were removed with the circle of Willis intact
and placed in 4% formalin overnight at 4°C before examination with
ImageJ software. Pictures were taken at 40⫻ magnification on a camera
connected to a surgical microscope (Leica DFC29). Before analysis, the
pictures were additionally 3⫻ magnified and the diameter of the PcomAs
was measured as a percentage of the basilar artery (BA) diameter
(Kitagawa et al., 1998). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann–Whitney rank-sum test. For evaluation of early ischemic cell death,
additional WT (n ⫽ 4) and bax ⫺ / ⫺ mice (n ⫽ 4) as well as shamoperated WT controls that underwent surgery except for the insertion of
the silicone-coated 8-0 nylon monofilament into the internal carotid
artery (n ⫽ 3), were killed 6 h after termination of procedures. Brain
samples were removed and 12 ␮m sections from each sample were collected at the level of dorsal hippocampus (Paxinos and Franklin, 2001).
Measurement of cell death was assessed by Fluoro-Jade B (FJB; Millipore) staining as described previously (Engel et al., 2012). FJB is a polyanionic fluorescein derivitave that specifically stains degenerating
neurons. Hippocampal FJB-positive neurons were the average of two
adjacent sections for CA3 and CA1 for each genotype. Analysis of DNA
damage was performed using a fluorescein-based terminal deoxynucleotidyl dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technique, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega; Murphy et al., 2007).

Cell lines

Oxygen-glucose deprivation in mouse neocortical neurons

Preparation of mouse neocortical neurons

Human prostate cancer DU-145 cells, which lack Bax expression (Xu et
al., 2006), and DU-145 Bax cells, which reexpress Bax (von Haefen et al.,
2002), were cultured in DMEM (Lonza) with 4.5 g/L glucose, 100 U/ml

Cortical neurons from WT and bax ⫺ / ⫺ mice, cultured on 24-well plates,
were rinsed in a prewarmed glucose-free medium and then transferred to
the hypoxic chamber (COY Lab Products Inc.). The hypoxic chamber

had an atmosphere comprising 1.5% O2, 5% CO2, and 85% N2, and the
temperature was maintained at 35°C. Neurons were then incubated with
oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) medium (bubbled with N2 for 1 h
before use). The OGD medium consisted of the following (in mM): 2
CaCl2, 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgSO4, and 10
sucrose, pH 6.8. After 45 min of OGD, the medium was removed and the
conditioned medium replaced. Thereafter, cells were placed in normoxic
conditions (21% O2 and 5% CO2) and allowed to recover for 24 h. The
following day, cortical neurons were stained with 1 ␮g/ml Hoechst 33258
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 ␮M propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and neuronal injury was assessed using an Eclipse TE 300 inverted microscope
(Nikon) with 20 ⫻ 0.43 numerical aperture (NA) phase contrast objective using the appropriate filter set for Hoechst/propidium iodide (PI)
and using a charge-coupled device camera (SPOT RT SE 6; Diagnostic
Instruments). Control neurons were treated similarly but were not exposed to OGD. All experiments were performed at least three times with
independent cultures and for each time point; images of nuclei were
captured in three subfields containing ⬃300 – 400 neurons each and repeated in triplicate. The number of PI-positive cells was expressed as a
percentage of total cells in the field. Resultant images were processed
using ImageJ.

Plasmids and transfection
Neocortical neurons (DIV 6) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). For overexpression of Bax, cortical neurons were transfected with a vector expressing WT bax flanked by yellow fluorescent
protein (YFP) (Luetjens et al., 2001, Düssmann et al., 2010). The bax9294A plasmid was a gift from Dr. Xu Luo (Eppley Institute for Cancer
Research, Omaha, Nebraska); it expresses a mutant form of bax that is
unable to oligomerize and fused to GFP (George et al., 2007). Controls
were transfected with a plasmid for enhanced GFP ( pEGFP-N1; BD
Bioscience Clontech). For mitochondrial and ER calcium experiments,
neurons were transfected with a vector expressing the mitochondrial
(mtcD2cpv) or the endoplasmic reticulum (ERD1cpv) cameleon FRET
probes, respectively (kindly supplied by Roger Tsien and Tullio Pozzan;
Palmer et al., 2006). They both consist of the Ca 2⫹-binding protein
calmodulin (CaM) fused together with the CaM-binding domain of myosin light chain kinase (M13). The resulting protein construct is flanked
at the carboxyl and N termini by mutants of GFP, CFP, and YFP. Upon
Ca 2⫹ binding, the CaM wraps around the M13 domain, producing a
conformational change of the entire molecule, which positions the two
CFP and YFP fluorophores into close spatial proximity, resulting in an
increase of FRET efficiency (Miyawaki et al., 1997, Rudolf et al., 2003).
Cortical neurons were used for experiments 24 h after transfection. For
cytosolic ATP measurements, cortical neurons were transfected with a
vector expressing the genetically encoded FRET-based cytosolic ATP indicator (ATeam; AT1.03/pcDNA3.1, kindly supplied by Dr Hiroyuki
Noji [Imamura et al., 2009]). The cytosolic ATP-sensitive FRET probe
consists of variants of CFP (mseCFP) and YFP (cp173-mVenus) connected by the ␧ subunit of Bacillus subtilis FoF1-ATP synthase. Upon
cytosolic ATP level changes, the ␧ subunit retracts the two fluorophores
close to each other, which increases FRET efficiency (Imamura et al.,
2009).

Western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation
Preparation of cell lysates and Western blotting was performed as described previously (Reimertz et al., 2003). The resulting blots were
probed with a mouse monoclonal supernatant NR2A glutamate receptor
antibody (clone N327/95; NeuroMab) diluted 1:10; a mouse monoclonal
supernatant NR2B glutamate receptor antibody (clone N59/20; NeuroMab) diluted 1:10; a purified mouse monoclonal NR1 glutamate receptor antibody (clone N308/48; NeuroMab) diluted 1:10; a mouse
monoclonal supernatant GluA2/GluR2 antibody (clone L21/32; NeuroMab) diluted 1:10; and a mouse monoclonal ␤-actin antibody (clone DM
1A; Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:5000. A goat polyclonal anti-IP3RII (C-20,
sc-7278; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a normal goat-IgG (sc-2028;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for coimmunoprecipitation analyses and captured by Dynabeads Protein G (Novex Life Technologies)
following the manufacturer’s protocol. After Laemmli-buffer lysis and

electrophoreses, a mouse monoclonal Bcl-2 antibody (5K140, sc-70411;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for immunodetection. Horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:10,000 (Pierce)
were detected using Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) and imaged using a FujiFilm LAS-3000 imaging
system.

Time-lapse live cell imaging
Intracellular calcium measurements with Fluo-4. Primary neocortical neurons on Willco dishes were coloaded with the calcium dye Fluo-4 AM (3
␮M) and TMRM (20 nM) for 30 min at 37°C (in the dark) in experimental
buffer containing the following (in mM): 120 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 0.4 KH2PO4,
20 HEPES, 5 NaHCO3, 1.2 Na2SO4, 1.2 CaCl2, and 15 glucose, pH 7.4.
The cells were washed and bathed in 2 ml of experimental buffer containing TMRM and a thin layer of mineral oil was added to prevent
evaporation. Neurons were placed on the stage of a LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope equipped with a 63 ⫻ 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective
and a thermostatically regulated chamber (Carl Zeiss). After 30 minutes
of equilibration time, neurons were exposed to 100 ␮M NMDA for 5 min
and glycine (10 ␮M) with MK-801 (5 ␮M) was added to block NMDA
receptor activation as required (D’Orsi et al., 2012). TMRM was excited
at 543 nm and the emission collected with a 560 nm long-pass filter;
Fluo-4 was excited at 488 nm and the emission was collected through a
505–550 nm barrier filter. Images were captured every 30 s during
NMDA excitation and every 5 min during the rest of the experiments.
Intracellular calcium measurements with Fura-2. Fura-2 is a dualexcitation wavelength Ca 2⫹ indicator that can passively diffuse across
cell membranes where endogenous esterases cleave the AM group, trapping the dye inside the cells. Cortical neurons were coloaded with Fura-2
AM (6 ␮M) and TMRM (20 nM) for 30 min at 37°C (in the dark) in
experimental buffer. The cells were rinsed and bathed in 2 ml of experimental buffer containing TMRM and mineral oil was added on top.
Neurons were then placed on the stage of an Axiovert 200M motorized
microscope equipped with a 40 ⫻ 1.3 NA oil-immersion objective and a
thermostatically regulated chamber (Carl Zeiss). After a 5 min baseline,
cortical neurons were exposed to NMDA-induced excitotoxic injury
(100 ␮M/5 min NMDA). Images were captured every 30 s during baseline
and NMDA excitation and every 2 min during the rest of the experiments. Once bound to Ca 2⫹, Fura-2 exhibits an absorption shift that can
be observed by alternating the excitation between 340 and 380 nm at a
band width of 15 nm while monitoring the emission between 500 and 540
nm (Grynkiewicz et al., 1985). TMRM was excited at 540 –585 nm and
the emission collected at 602– 650 nm, YFP and GFP were excited at
485–514 nm and 455– 490 nm, and the emission was recorded at 526 –
557 nm and 500 –540 nm, respectively. The sarcoendoplasmic reticulum
Ca 2⫹-ATPases (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin (5 ␮M) was added to the
medium 10 min after start of the timelapse recording.
Mitochondrial and ER calcium measurements with mtcD2cpv and
ERD1cpv, respectively. Neurons, transfected with the mtcD2cpv or the
ERD1cpv calcium probe and loaded with TMRM (20 nM) in experimental buffer, were placed on the stage of an LSM 7.10 confocal microscope
equipped with a 63 ⫻ 1.4 NA oil-immersion objective and a thermostatically regulated chamber set at 37°C (Carl Zeiss). After a baseline equilibration time, NMDA (100 ␮M/5 min) dissolved in experimental buffer
was added to the medium. TMRM was excited at 561 nm and the emission was collected by a 575 nm long-pass filter. CFP was excited at 405 nm
and emission was collected at 445–505 nm and 505–555 nm for FRET.
YFP was excited directly using the 489 nm laser diode and detected with
the same band-pass filter used for FRET. Images were captured every 1
min throughout these experiments. Thapsigargin (5 ␮M) was used and
added to the medium on stage 10 min after equilibration time.
Single-cell cytosolic ATP measurements with ATeam. Neurons, transfected with the FRET-based cytosolic ATP indicator ATeam and loaded
with TMRM (20 nM) in experimental buffer, were placed on the stage of
an LSM 5Live duoscan confocal microscope equipped with a 40 ⫻ 1.3 NA
oil-immersion objective and a thermostatically regulated chamber set at
37°C (INDIMO 1080; Carl Zeiss). After a 10 min equilibration time,
neurons were exposed to 100 ␮M NMDA for 5 min. TMRM was excited at
561 nm and the emission was collected by a 575 nm long-pass filter. CFP

D’Orsi et al. • Bax Regulates Neuronal Ca2⫹

was excited at 405 nm and emission was collected at 445–505 (CFP) and
505–555 nm (FRET). YFP was excited directly using the 489 nm laser
diode and detected with the same band-pass filter used for FRET. Images
were captured every 1 min throughout these experiments.
Imaging of mPTP opening. mPTP opening was examined by calcein
release from mitochondria in DU-145 and DU-145 Bax human prostate
cancer cells (von Haefen et al., 2002, Xu et al., 2006). Cells plated on small
Willco dishes were first loaded with calcein-AM (1 ␮M) for 30 min in
Krebs solution containing the following (in mM): 140 NaCl; 5.9 KCl; 1.2
MgCl2; 15 HEPES; 2.5 CaCl2, and 10 glucose, pH 7.4. After that, CoCl2 (1
mM) was added for 10 min to quench cytosol calcein and cells were then
bathed in 150 ␮l of Krebs solution containing TMRM (20 nM) and covered by a thin layer of mineral oil. The cells were placed on the stage of a
LSM 7.10 confocal microscope equipped with a 63 ⫻ 1.4 NA oilimmersion objective and thermostatically regulated chamber set at 37°C
(Carl Zeiss). Calcein AM and cobalt enter the cell, where the AM groups
are cleaved from calcein via nonspecific esterase activity in the cytosol
and mitochondria. Cobalt cannot enter healthy mitochondria and
quenches the cytosolic calcein signal. Upon opening of the mPTP,
cobalt enters through the pore and subsequently quenches the mitochondrial calcein fluorescence. Calcein was excited at 488 nm and
emission was collected through a 505–550 nm band-pass filter.
TMRM was excited at 561 nm, and the emission was collected by a 575
nm long-pass filter. mPTP opening was indicated by a reduction in
mitochondrial calcein signal, measured every minute, and expressed
as SD of calcein fluorescence.

Isolation of functional mitochondria and measurement of swelling
Mitochondria were isolated from mouse liver or brain synaptosome following the methods of Frezza et al. (2007). Protein was measured using
Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in experimental buffer containing 125 mM KCl, 20 mM HEPES, 2
mM KH2PO4, 1 ␮M EGTA, 4 mM MgCl2, 3 mM ATP, 5 mM malate, and 5
mM glutamate Chinopoulos et al., 2003) at a final concentration of 1
mg/ml and 100 ␮l was added to a 96-well flat-bottomed transparent
plate. Absorbance at 540 nm was detected in each well at 30 s intervals in
a BioTek Synergy HT microplate reader and CaCl2 (100 ␮mol/l) was
used. Alamethicin (80 ␮g/ml) was then added to induce maximal swelling. All experiments were performed on at least three separate preparations to ensure reproducibility of results.

Imaging analysis
All microscope settings, including laser intensity and scan time, were
kept constant for the whole set of experiments. Control experiments were
also performed and showed that photo toxicity had a negligible impact.
All images were processed and analyzed using MetaMorph Software version 7.5 (Universal Imaging) and the data were presented normalized to

bax deficiency protects against neuronal cell death in vitro
and in vivo
We recently demonstrated that bax-deficient primary mouse cortical neurons were resistant to neuronal injury induced by transient NMDA receptor overactivation (D’Orsi et al., 2012).
Because glutamate toxicity is believed to contribute to ischemic
and hypoxic neuronal injury, we were interested in determining
whether bax deficiency could also reduce ischemic brain injury in
vivo. For this purpose, two groups of mice, WT and bax deficient,
were subjected to tMCAo. No significant difference in the plasticity of the PcomA was observed in bax-deficient versus WT
control mice (n ⫽ 4 per genotype) by Mann–Whitney rank-sum

test. The mean scores of PcomAs, measured in each hemisphere
and calculated as a percentage of the BA diameter, were 21.64 ⫾
1.84% for bax-deficient mice and 25.92 ⫾ 0.89% for WT mice
(Fig. 1A).
WT and bax-deficient mice were subjected to 60 min of transient focal ischemia and reperfused for 24 h. bax deficiency led to
a pronounced reduction in ischemic tissue damage. Protection in
bax-deficient mice was observed in the lateral striatum and the
adjacent cerebral cortex with a significant difference in the infarct
size at various brain section levels (Fig. 1B–D). The edemacorrected infarct volume was reduced from 57 ⫾ 4.9 mm 3 in the
WT mice to 28.5 ⫾ 5.4 mm 3 in the bax-deficient mice (Fig. 1E).
bax-deficient mice subjected to tMCAo also had significantly
reduced neurological deficit scores compared with their WT
counterparts (Fig. 1F ). The extent of cerebral edema in the baxdeficient animals was also diminished compared with the WT
controls after ischemia/reperfusion injury (Fig. 1G).
This surprising, pronounced protection against ischemic tissue injury and edema formation suggested that the effects of bax
deficiency were not limited to a protection against mitochondrial
apoptosis pathways. To address this, we assessed whether bax
deficiency also protected against acute neuronal injury in this in
vivo model. The hippocampus is a brain structure particularly
vulnerable to ischemic injury. We therefore quantified neuronal
injury in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus
after 6 h of reperfusion using FJB, a marker of neuronal cell death
(Wang et al., 2004c, Zheng et al., 2004). Acute cell death in the
CA1 hippocampal subfield occurred in the absence of nuclear
shrinkage and was negative for TUNEL staining (Fig. 2A, top).
Hippocampal sections from mice subjected to status epilepticus
for 24 h (Engel et al., 2010) showed strong TUNEL in the CA3 and
served as positive controls (Fig. 2A, bottom). Interestingly, the
number of FJB-positive cells was significantly reduced in the hippocampus of bax-deficient mice compared with their WT controls, suggesting that Bax may regulate TUNEL-negative, necrotic
neuronal injury in vivo (Fig. 2C–E). FJB-positive cells were not
notable in sham-operated control animals (Fig. 2 B, E).
We next turned to a model of OGD-induced neuronal injury
in cortical neurons in which the effect of bax deficiency on different modes of cell death could be examined in more detail. Neurons were subjected to OGD for 45 min in the presence or absence
of the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, a treatment that
“unmasks” neuronal apoptosis (Goldberg and Choi, 1993). Neurons were allowed to recover over a 24 h time period, after which
neuronal injury was determined by PI uptake and Hoechst 33258
staining of nuclear chromatin (Fig. 2 F, G). Quantification of
Hoechst 33258- and PI-positive cells revealed that treatment with
MK-801 significantly attenuated OGD-induced neuronal injury
in WT neurons, but that the “apoptotic” component of OGDinduced neuronal injury evidenced by nuclear fragmentation and
condensation was retained (Fig. 2G). bax deficiency further reduced OGD-induced injury in cultures treated with MK-801.
OGD-induced injury in the absence of MK-801 was characterized
by PI-positive cell death but occurred largely in the absence of
nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 2G). Notably, bax deficiency also
protected neurons against OGD-induced injury in the absence of
MK-801 (Fig. 2 F, G), again suggesting that the protective effects
of bax deficiency on neuronal injury were broader than previously assumed.

2003, Chen et al., 2004b, Mathai et al., 2005, Oakes et al., 2005,
Karch et al., 2013), we hypothesized that bax gene deletion may
regulate neuronal Ca 2⫹ dynamics, which could explain the
broader cell-death-inhibiting activities observed. To address this
complexity in more detail, we returned to the more controlled
environment of excitotoxic injury (Ward et al., 2007, D’Orsi et
al., 2012). Cortical neurons from WT and bax-deficient mice
were exposed to 100 ␮M NMDA for 5 min, allowed to recover,
and monitored over 24 h. Intracellular Ca 2⫹ and mitochondrial
membrane potential (⌬␺m) responses were recorded simultaneously by confocal imaging using the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo-4 AM and the membrane-permeant cationic fluorescent
probe TMRM. NMDA excitation resulted in an initial increase of
intracellular Ca 2⫹ that rapidly returned to baseline levels (Fig.
3 A, B). After the insult, neurons derived from WT mice and undergoing excitotoxic apoptosis displayed delayed calcium dereg-

ulation (DCD) within 5–15 h of stimulation (Fig. 3A), whereas
bax-deficient neurons maintained their Ca 2⫹ homeostasis for
longer periods (Fig. 3B) and underwent DCD at a much lower
frequency than their WT counterparts (Fig. 3C). Interestingly,
analysis of individual Ca 2⫹ responses showed a significant reduction in cytosolic Ca 2⫹ transients during NMDA (100 ␮M/5 min)
exposure in the bax-deficient compared with the WT neurons, as
evidenced by decreased extent of peak Ca 2⫹ influx at the point of
NMDA stimulation (Fig. 3D) and the smaller area under the
Ca 2⫹ curve during excitation (Fig. 3E). Because the Ca 2⫹indicator Fluo-4 AM is a single wavelength dye (Gee et al., 2000,
Sato et al., 2007), we also performed these experiments using the
ratiometric probe Fura-2 AM, allowing for quantitative determination of intracellular calcium concentration (Tsien et al., 1985,
Barreto-Chang and Dolmetsch, 2009). When WT and baxdeficient cortical neurons were exposed to NMDA (100 ␮M/5

Figure 3. bax deficiency protects against Ca 2⫹ deregulation in response to NMDA. WT and bax ⫺ / ⫺ cortical neurons cultured separately on Willco dishes were preloaded with TMRM (20 nM) and
Fluo-4 AM (3 ␮M) for 30 min at 37°C before being monitored by a confocal microscope (LSM 710). Neurons were exposed to 100 ␮M NMDA for 5 minutes, after which alterations in ⌬␺m and

bax ⫺ / ⫺ (n ⫽ 21) neurons], confirming our previous data using
Fluo-4 AM.
Analysis of ⌬␺m kinetics using TMRM showed a significant
increase in the TMRM fluorescence of the WT neurons within a
1–2 h time period after NMDA excitation, evidence of hyperpolarization of the ⌬␺m (Fig. 4 A, C), followed by a final depolarization of the ⌬␺m. In contrast, although bax-deficient neurons
showed similar initial mitochondrial membrane depolarization
(reduction in TMRM fluorescence to 0.71 ⫾ 0.07 and 0.64 ⫾ 0.04
for WT and bax-deficient neurons, respectively), they did not
display a considerable ⌬␺m hyperpolarization, as evidenced by
the constant basal levels of TMRM fluorescence observed after
the initial NMDA exposure (Fig. 4 B, C) and showed a significantly reduced incidence of late ⌬␺m depolarization.
bax reintroduction recovers NMDA-induced Ca 2ⴙ transients
We next explored the possibility that the observed differences in
cytosolic, NMDA-induced Ca 2⫹ transients were due to altered
glutamate receptor levels in the WT versus bax-deficient neuron
cultures as a consequence of different development of cortical
neurons before isolation or during cultivation. Using quantitative Western blotting, we noted no significant alteration in the
protein levels of the extrasynaptic NMDA receptor NR2B, which
largely mediates cytosolic Ca 2⫹ transients and excitotoxic injury
(Zhou and Baudry, 2006, Liu et al., 2007, Lau and Tymianski,
2010, Martel et al., 2012). Furthermore, no statistically signficant
difference in NR1 and AMPA receptor GluA2 levels were ob-

served between WT and bax-deficient neurons (Fig. 5 A, B). We
noted a tendency toward reduced levels of the synpatic, “neuroprotective” NMDA receptor subunit NR2A (Liu et al., 2007, Lau
and Tymianski, 2010); however, this did not reach the level of
statistical significance (Fig. 5 A, B).
We next performed bax gene rescue experiments to control
for potential differences in NMDA-induced Ca 2⫹ entry. Cortical
neurons were transfected with GFP, bax-YFP, or a mutant of bax
(bax-9294A-GFP) that is unable to oligomerize at the mitochondrial outer membrane (George et al., 2007) and loaded
with Fura-2AM. Again, we noted significantly reduced Ca 2⫹
levels in bax-deficient cortical neurons transfected with GFP
compared with their WT counterparts when exposed to NMDA
(100 ␮M/5 min; Fig. 5C, D, G,H ). Reintroduction of bax using
either WT bax-YFP or the mutant bax-9294A-GFP equally restored neuronal Ca 2⫹ levels to levels observed in WT cortical
neurons transfected with GFP (Fig. 5C,E–H ).
bax deficiency does not alter free mitochondrial matrix Ca 2ⴙ
and does not increase cytosolic ATP levels
Previous reports have shown that mitochondria are capable of
taking up significant amounts of cytosolic Ca 2⫹ during excitotoxic injury (Sobecks et al., 1996, Stout et al., 1998, Yu et al.,
2004). We therefore explored whether bax deficiency reduced
cytosolic Ca 2⫹ levels by facilitating mitochondrial Ca 2⫹ uptake.
To determine whether bax-deficient neurons showed a greater
mitochondrial free Ca 2⫹ concentration compared with their
WT control neurons, we used a mitochondrial Ca 2⫹ sensor
(mtcD2cpv) FRET probe (Palmer et al., 2006). As a consequence
of Ca 2⫹ binding, the mtcD2cpv FRET probe produces an increase in FRET efficiency, allowing for a detection of free matrix

Figure 6. bax deficiency does not influence free mitochondrial matrix Ca 2⫹ levels and does not prevent ATP depletion during NMDA excitation. Cortical neurons derived from WT and bax ⫺ / ⫺
mice were transfected with either the mitochondrial Ca 2⫹ sensor FRET probe (mtcD2cpv) and after 24 h mounted on the stage of a LSM 710 microscope or the ATP-sensitive (ATeam) FRET probe and
after 24 h mounted on the stage of a LSM 5Live duoscan microscope. Fluorescent measurements were recorded for TMRM, FRET, CFP, and YFP by time-lapse confocal microscope. FRET probe imaging
data are expressed as a ratio of FRET/CFP. TMRM was used as a ⌬␺m indicator (nonquenched mode). A, B, WT and bax ⫺ / ⫺ cortical neurons transfected with the mitochondrial Ca 2⫹ sensor FRET
probe were then treated with 100 ␮M NMDA for 5 min and assayed over 24 h. Representative traces and corresponding images of NMDA-treated neurons depicting the extent of peak mitochondrial
Ca 2⫹ influx at point of stimulation (100 ␮M/5 min NMDA) and at later time points are illustrated. In neurons that showed a delayed excitotoxicity (A), we observed significant mitochondrial calcium
accumulation (FRET probe activation) simultaneously with a delayed ⌬␺m depolarization. In contrast, bax ⫺ / ⫺ neurons (B) that were tolerant to excitotoxic injury did not show a detectable FRET

tion against the secondary increase in free mitochondrial Ca 2⫹
(Fig. 6 B, C).
Bax and other Bcl-2 family proteins have also been shown to
be important for mitochondrial bioenergetics and quality control
(Karbowski et al., 2002, Du et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004, Karbowski et al., 2006). We next investigated whether bax-deficient
neurons showed an enhanced bioenergetic capacity that may allow them to more efficiently extrude cytosolic Ca 2⫹, for example,
through plasma membrane Ca 2⫹-dependent ATPases (PMCA),
a key enzyme in the control of neuronal Ca 2⫹ levels during excitiotoxic injury (Budd and Nicholls, 1996). To determine cytosolic ATP levels at the single-cell level, we used an ATP-sensitive
FRET probe ATeam (Imamura et al., 2009) and monitored ⌬␺m
in parallel by time-lapse confocal microscopy in WT and baxdeficient neurons. We detected a rapid, comparable ATP depletion during NMDA stimulation (100 ␮M/5 min) followed by
similarly restored ATP levels in both genotypes (recovery to baseline: FRET/CFP fluorescence to 0.97 ⫾ 0.008 and 1.03 ⫾ 0.022 for
WT and bax ⫺ / ⫺ neurons; Fig. 6G,H ), indicating the bax gene
deletion did not affect cytosolic ATP dynamics. Interestingly,
bax-deficient neurons displayed a significantly lower baseline cytosolic ATP level compared with their WT controls (100 ⫾ 9.43%
and 67.19 ⫾ 10.31% for WT and bax ⫺ / ⫺ neurons, respectively;
p ⱕ 0.05 compared with NMDA-treated WT controls by
ANOVA, post hoc Tukey), suggesting that bax-deficient neurons
displayed, if anything, a decreased bioenergetic capacity.
bax deficiency does not modulate Ca 2ⴙ-induced
permeability transition
We next tested the hypothesis that bax deficiency may prevent the
formation of a Ca 2⫹-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) (Narita et al., 1998); that is, that Bax may be
a physiologic activator of this pore (Antonsson et al., 1997, Vyssokikh et al., 2002). We examined a putative requirement for Bax
in mPTP opening using isolated mitochondria from mouse brain
synaptosomes and mouse liver. The effect of exposure of baxproficient and bax-deficient mitochondria on Ca 2⫹-induced mitochondrial swelling were detected by a rapid loss of absorbance
at 540 nm. Alamethicin, a membrane-channel-forming peptide
that induces mitochondrial swelling similar to mPTP (Andreyev
et al., 1998, Andreyev and Fiskum, 1999), was used as a positive
control to produce maximal swelling of mitochondria. As reported previously (An et al., 2004), Ca 2⫹ addition to isolated
mitochondria from WT (and bax-deficient) mouse brain synaptosomal preparations failed to induce significant mitochondrial
swelling, with no differences detected between the two genotypes
(Fig. 7 A, B). In contrast, mitochondrial swelling in response to
Ca 2⫹ was more pronounced in mitochondria isolated from
mouse liver, however, this was not modulated by bax deficiency
(Fig. 7C,D). We also failed to detect a significant difference in
mitochondrial swelling between WT and bax/bak doubledeficient mitochondria isolated from human HCT 116 colon
cancer cells (data not shown).
To analyze mPTP in intact cells, we also performed a calcein/
Co 2⫹-quenching assay (Su et al., 2004) in bax-deficient and baxreexpressing DU-145 cells. The prostate carcinoma cell line DU145 carries a frameshift mutation in the bax gene and thus does
not express Bax (Xu et al., 2006). The calcein/Co 2⫹ assay is based
on the concept that mitochondrial calcein fluorescence is
quenched by Co 2⫹ after the irreversible opening of the mPTP.
Cells were exposed to sequential addition of the Ca 2⫹ ionophore
ionomycin (1 and 10 ␮M) both in the presence and absence of the
mPTP inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA; 10 ␮M; Fig. 7E–G). When 1

J. Neurosci., January 28, 2015 • 35(4):1706 –1722 • 1715

or 10 ␮M ionomycin was added to bax-deficient DU-145 cells,
calcein fluorescent signals remained within mitochondria (Fig.
7E–G, gray), whereas significant calcein leakages from mitochondria was seen in bax-reexpressing DU-145 cells (Fig. 7E–G, blue).
The mPTP inhibitor CsA abolished the ionomycin-induced calcein leakage in bax-deficient DU-145 cells (Fig. 7E–G, black), as
well as bax-reexpressing DU-145 cells (Fig. 7E–G, red). Next,
intracellular Ca 2⫹ levels were determined in bax-deficient DU145 and bax-reexpressing DU-145 cells using Fura-2 AM. bax
deficiency also reduced ionomycin-induced Ca 2⫹ transients
compared with DU-145 cells in which bax was reintroduced (Fig.
7H ). These data suggested that Bax modulates Ca 2⫹ transients
intracellularly (Fig. 5), but also demonstrated that effects of Bax
on Ca 2⫹-induced mPTP in intact cells are downstream of its
effects on cytosolic Ca 2⫹ levels.
bax deficiency regulates ER Ca 2ⴙ handling
Previous reports, although partially contradictory, have suggested that Bcl-2 family proteins may be involved in regulating
cell death by influencing ER calcium stores and signaling (Scorrano et al., 2003, Oakes et al., 2005, Rong et al., 2009, Chipuk et
al., 2010). We next tested the hypothesis that bax-deficient neurons showed elevated ER Ca 2⫹ levels in response to NMDA excitation or showed altered ER Ca 2⫹ fluxes. To monitor free ER
calcium in our single-cell system, we used the ER Ca 2⫹ sensor
(ERD1cpv) FRET probe (Palmer et al., 2006). Transfection of
WT and bax-deficient cortical neurons with the FRET probe revealed that ER Ca 2⫹ levels were not significantly altered during
the NMDA exposure [mean peak FRET/CFP fluorescence
1.039 ⫾ 0.008 and 1.051 ⫾ 0.008 for WT (n ⫽ 22) and bax ⫺ / ⫺
(n ⫽ 33) neurons, respectively] or at baseline conditions [mean
FRET/CFP fluorescence 1.04 AU ⫾ 0.03 and 1.02 AU ⫾ 0.01 for
WT (n ⫽ 39) and bax ⫺ / ⫺ (n ⫽ 40) neurons, respectively].
The concentration of Ca 2⫹ within the ER is suggested to
highly exceed the concentration of Ca 2⫹ within the cytosol
([Ca 2⫹]ER ⬃100 –500 ␮M, [Ca 2⫹]cyt ⬃100 nM; Liu et al., 2004,
Peirce and Chen, 2004). The possibility therefore remained that,
in bax-deficient neurons, cytosolic Ca 2⫹ levels were simply mobilized quicker into the ER than in WT neurons. To test this
hypothesis, we inhibited ER Ca 2⫹ uptake with the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin. Thapsigargin (5 ␮M) was added to the medium
of WT and bax-deficient cortical neurons prior (20 min) to
NMDA stimulation and ER or cytosolic Ca 2⫹ levels and ⌬␺m
using TMRM were monitored. SERCA inhibition produced a
prompt decrease in ER Ca 2⫹ in both genotypes followed by similar Ca 2⫹ increases before, during, and after NMDA excitation
(Fig. 8 A, B,F ). Detailed analysis of individual ER Ca 2⫹ traces
showed a significant reduction in the slope of the ER Ca 2⫹ flux
after thapsigargin treatment in the bax-deficient compared with
the WT neurons (⌬t ⫽ Tg offset time ⫺ Tg onset time: 3.78
min ⫾ 0.29 in WT vs 7.36 min ⫾ 0.38 in bax ⫺ / ⫺; Fig. 8C,D).
However, no significant difference was observed in ER Ca 2⫹ levels at thapsigargin offset (Fig. 8E). Moreover, quantification of
the individual ⌬␺m responses showed that the combined presence of
the SERCA inhibitor and bax gene deletion prevented a complete
NMDA-induced depolarization of the ⌬␺m (Fig. 8G–I).
Inhibition of the SERCA also greatly increased intracellular
Ca 2⫹ levels in response to NMDA in bax-deficient cortical neurons, but not so in WT neurons (Fig. 9 A, B). In response to the
treatments, 14% of WT neurons did not display Ca 2⫹ recovery to
basal levels 30 min after NMDA excitation compared with 52% of
bax-deficient neurons (Fig. 9C). Reintroduction of bax in baxdeficient cortical neurons using a mammalian expression vector

Finally, we assessed whether bax deficiency modulated the

in bax may increase the ability of Bcl-2 to interact with IP3R. This
interaction has been reported previously in B-cell lymphoma and
in WEHI7.2 mouse lymphoid cells (Rong et al., 2009, Akl et al.,

interaction between the two genotypes (Fig. 9E). Comparable
results were also obtained performing the reverse coimmunoprecipation (data not shown).
Together, these data suggested that Bax participates in the
efficient flux of Ca 2⫹ between cytosol and the ER and that inhibition of this activity may be associated with neuroprotection and
reduced cytosolic Ca 2⫹ overloading during excitotoxic injury.

Discussion
In the present study, we set out to explore the role of bax in the
setting of Ca 2⫹-induced neuronal cell death. Using models of
ischemic and excitotoxic injury, we demonstrated that bax gene
deletion provided broad neuroprotection against excitotoxic
neuronal injury and OGD-mediated injury in mouse neocortical
neurons in vitro and in cerebral ischemic injury in vivo. Our data
suggest that this broad protection may be the result of Bax regulating Ca 2⫹ homeostasis independently from its classical func-

tion in the apoptotic cell death machinery or a proposed
involvement in mitochondrial PTP opening.
bax deletion is sufficient to confer protection against numerous apoptotic stimuli in cultured neurons in vitro, including
neurotrophic factor deprivation and excitotoxic and DNA
damage-induced neuronal apoptosis (Deckwerth et al., 1996,
Miller et al., 1997, Deshmukh and Johnson, 1998, Xiang et al.,
1998, Wang et al., 2004a), because Bak has been reported to be
nonfunctional in mature neurons (Sun et al., 2001, Uo et al.,
2005). Neuroprotective effects of bax deficiency have also been
reported in cerebellar and cortical neurons in glutamate-induced
excitotoxicity in vitro (Xiang et al., 1998), in a model of excitotoxic cell death of striatal neurons in vivo (Pérez-Navarro et al.,
2005), and in models of hypoxic/ischemic neonatal injury in the
hippocampus (Gibson et al., 2001), which involve predominantly
apoptotic, caspase-mediated cell death pathways (Hu et al., 2000,

that bax deficiency provides neuroprotection against TUNELnegative, necrotic injury during ischemic stroke (Figs. 1, 2). Previous reports have also suggested a role of Bax in the regulation
and formation of the mPTP (Kennedy et al., 1997, Narita et al.,
1998). mPTP opening is generally associated with necrosis rather
than apoptosis (Mao et al., 2001, Nakagawa et al., 2005) and has
been shown to be involved in excitotoxicity (Li et al., 2009). In
contrast to apoptotic MOMP, the mPTP is a channel of the inner
mitochondrial membrane and leads to ⌬␺m dissipation, cessa-

tion of oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis, ROS production, mitochondrial swelling, and matrix Ca 2⫹ release
(Marshansky et al., 2001, Wen et al., 2001). We did not detect a
significant role of Bax in regulating Ca 2⫹-induced mPTP in isolated mitochondria from mouse liver and, in agreement with
earlier studies (An et al., 2004), we failed to easily trigger Ca 2⫹
induced mPTP in mitochondria isolated from neurons (Fig. 7).
Rather, our data generated in DU-145 cells (that readily underwent Ca 2⫹-induced mPTP) suggested that any effects of Bax on
mPTP activation in intact cells may be secondary to the effects of
Bax on cytosolic Ca 2⫹ handling (Fig. 7).
Indeed, one of the key findings of our study was that Bax
regulated neuronal Ca 2⫹ homeostasis. bax-deficient neurons
showed reduced Ca 2⫹ transients during the period of NMDA
excitation compared with WT neurons. Control experiments in
WT neurons using a Smac-YFP fusion protein showed that
MOM permeabilization did not occur during NMDA excitation
(data not shown). Furthermore, reintroduction of bax using plasmids expressing either bax or a mutant form of bax that is unable
to oligomerize at the MOM, both restored neuronal Ca 2⫹ levels
in bax-deficient neurons during NMDA excitation (Fig. 5). Collectively, these data indicated that the effect of Bax on neuronal
Ca 2⫹ homeostasis was independent of its role in promoting mitochondrial, Bcl-2-dependent apoptosis. It has also been demonstrated recently that the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL regulates
mitochondrial bioenergetics, normalizing ⌬␺m and subsequently
increasing ATP production by decreasing ion leak through the
F1F0 ATP synthase (Alavian et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2011). We
therefore also tested the hypothesis that Bax may directly or indirectly control mitochondrial energetics. However, bax deficiency did not improve neuronal bioenergetics (Fig. 6). bax
deletion slightly reduced basal cytosolic ATP levels. Given that
Bax also regulates mitochondrial fission, it is possible that this is
an indirect consequence of reduced mitochondrial quality control (Sheridan et al., 2008). Mitochondria have also been suggested to limit excitotoxic cell death by facilitating mitochondrial
Ca 2⫹ uptake, a process that removes cytosolic Ca 2⫹ and activates
mitochondrial metabolism through stimulation of matrix Ca 2⫹dependent dehydrogenases, leading to increased ATP production
required for the restoration of neuronal ion homeostasis (Rizzuto
et al., 2012). Mitochondria also tightly control the position and
propagation of cytosolic Ca 2⫹ fluxes and its recycling toward the
ER (Hajnóczky et al., 1999). Our investigation on free mitochondrial matrix and ER Ca 2⫹ levels during NMDA excitation
showed that bax deficiency did not affect overall free Ca 2⫹ levels
in either organelle (Figs. 6, 8). We detected, however, a significant
increase in free mitochondrial matrix Ca 2⫹ levels during the period of DCD, highlighting the engagement of mitochondria in
late cell death signaling, as well as the ability to detect alterations
in free mitochondrial matrix Ca 2⫹ using the mtcD2cpv FRET
probe (Fig. 6).
Organelle-targeted Ca 2⫹ sensors exhibit a signficantly lower
affinity to Ca 2⫹ than the cytosolic Ca 2⫹ indicators used in this
study, so the use of cytosolic dyes may be a more sensitive approach to detect alterations in Ca 2⫹ fluxes into and out of these
organelles. Remarkably, by inhibiting Ca 2⫹ uptake into the ER
using the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin, we demonstrated that
Bax facilitated the dynamics of Ca 2⫹ fluxes between cytosol and
ER during NMDA excitation (Figs. 8, 9). The Bcl-2 family has
been previously implicated in the regulation of the interaction
between mitochondria and ER by influencing ER Ca 2⫹ stores and
signaling in non-neuronal cells (Chipuk et al., 2010). Using

D’Orsi et al. • Bax Regulates Neuronal Ca2⫹

organelle-targeted aequorin probes or ER-targeted Ca 2⫹ sensors,
overexpression of Bcl-2 reduced the loading of intracellular Ca 2⫹
stores, such as the ER and the Golgi apparatus, by increasing
Ca 2⫹ leakage in HEK-293 and HeLa cells (Foyouzi-Youssefi et al.,
2000, Pinton et al., 2000). It was also suggested that the direct
interaction between the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 and the IP3R is
responsible for the inhibition of the IP3R activity and apoptosis,
reducing resting ER Ca 2⫹ levels and cytosolic Ca 2⫹ oscillations
in HeLa and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Pinton et al., 2000,
Rong et al., 2009). Moreover, Bax and Bak were suggested to
regulate ER Ca 2⫹ stores, possibly by inactivating the inhibitory
functions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL on the IP3R. Bcl-2 silencing or
SERCA overexpression restored both ER Ca 2⫹ and sensitivity of
mouse embryonic fibroblasts to apoptotic challenge (Scorrano et
al., 2003, Oakes et al., 2005). These findings are partially contradictory with other studies in which Bcl-2 did not show any effect
on ER Ca 2⫹ store, although an inhibition of ER Ca 2⫹ release
dynamics was proposed (Lam et al., 1994, Distelhorst et al., 1996,
He et al., 1997, Wang et al., 2001, Chen et al., 2004a). Our data are
consistent with the concept that Bcl-2 family proteins and, in
particular, Bax may be involved in controlling ER Ca 2⫹ stores by
normalizing the proficient Ca 2⫹ exchange between cytoplasm
and ER. Alterations in Ca 2⫹ fluxes between organelles and the
cytosol may also be associated with a reduction in Ca 2⫹-induced
Ca 2⫹ release from the ER. Our study indicated that neurons lacking bax did not display a substantial ⌬␺m hyperpolarization compared with their WT controls after NMDA excitation (Figs. 4, 8).
It is possible that this is a conseqeuence of reduced Ca 2⫹-induced
Ca 2⫹ release from the ER, resulting in a decreased stimulation of
the Krebs cycle.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that Bax regulates dynamic Ca 2⫹ signaling between ER and cytosol in neurons and
this role is independent of its classical role in the apoptotic cell
death machinery. Our data also suggest that targeting Bax may
exert broad protective effects against excitotoxic and ischemic
neuronal injury and that inhibition of Bax function should be
reconsidered as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of neuronal injury.
