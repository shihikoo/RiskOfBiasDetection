Abstract
The purpose of the study was to highlight the acute motor reflex adaptation and to deepen functional deficits following a
middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO-r). Thirty-six Sprague-Dawley rats were included in this study. The
middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO; 120 min) was performed on 16 rats studied at 1 and 7 days, respectively (MCAO-D1
and MCAO-D7, n = 8 for each group). The other animals were divided into 3 groups: SHAM-D1 (n = 6), SHAM-D7 (n = 6) and
Control (n = 8). Rats performed 4 behavioral tests (the elevated body swing test, the beam balance test, the ladder-climbing
test and the forelimb grip force) before the surgery and daily after MCAO-r. H-reflex on triceps brachii was measured before
and after isometric exercise. Infarction size and cerebral edema were respectively assessed by histological (Cresyl violet) and
MRI measurements at the same time points than H-reflex recordings. Animals with cerebral ischemia showed persistent
functional deficits during the first week post-MCAO-r. H-reflex was not decreased in response to isometric exercise one day
after the cerebral ischemia contrary to the other groups. The motor reflex regulation was recovered 7 days post-MCAO-r.
This result reflects an acute sensorimotor adaptation at the spinal level after MCAO-r.

showed functional disturbances after ischemia despite normal or
near-normal histology [7]. Moreover, some others demonstrated
that pharmacological treatments appeared to be ineffective based
on measurement of infarct volume but were found to significantly
improve functional outcome [8,9].
However, two major limitations hampered the understanding of
the pathophysiology of MCAO-r. On one hand, although the
overall behavioral tests enabled to detect disorders of the motor
control [5,10–12], they could not determine spinal and supraspinal
mechanisms responsible of the specific neural adaptation to
MCAO-r. Moreover, some functional outcomes concerning the
forelimbs stay controversial and need to be deepened. It is the case
of the effect of cerebral ischemia on the grip force of the forelimbs,
which is an important functional disorder after stroke. Indeed,
several authors showed a decline in force production whereas
other rat studies indicated an increase of grip force following
MCAO-r [13,14]. On the other hand, the amount of necrotic
tissue in the primary infarct site is only considered to be one factor
influencing functional recovery [5,10–12]. As behavioral tests,
histological measurements could not inform on the underlying
neuromuscular alterations affecting the contralateral limbs to the
cerebral ischemia [15].

Introduction
To date, stroke rehabilitation and pharmacological treatments
cannot ensure a complete functional recovery after stroke [1,2].
Therefore, stroke survivors frequently preserve, among others,
major chronic sensory and motor dysfunctions. To assess
treatments and discover new ones, the understanding of the
neural adaptation mechanisms underlying the functional impairments seems to be essential [3]. The neural mechanisms induced
by stroke refer to both neuronal damages and consecutive
neuromuscular adaptations around and below the lesion site
(including the neural network reorganization both in the spinal
cord and in the spared cerebral structures). However, these
mechanisms remain poorly understood.
To explore the underlying neural adaptation, several experimental models of focal cerebral ischemia were commonly used in
rats. The ‘‘Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion-reperfusion’’
(MCAO-r) is one of the most frequently used cerebral ischemia
method to study the neuronal death mechanisms and the severity
of functional outcomes by the use of several behavioral tests [4–6].
There is a growing consensus that the effective evaluation of
therapies in the rat MCAO-r model requires combination of
histological measurements and behavioral tests. Indeed, studies

(86/609/EEC). No sign of screech, prostration and hyperactivity
were observed through the experiment.
Among the 50 rats, 30 of them underwent MCAO-r surgery
and the 16 survivors were equally distributed into the MCAO-D1
and the MCAO-D7 groups, as indicated below. Thus, the survival
rate after MCAO-r surgery, comprising the rats of both MCAOD1 and MCAO-D7 groups, was 53.3%. Consequently, the
remaining 36 animals were randomly assigned to the following 5
groups: 1) Control (n = 8), 2) MCAO-D1 group (n = 8) in which
electrophysiological, histological and magnetic resonance imagery
(MRI) recordings were realized 1 day after MCAO-r, 3) MCAOD7 group (n = 8) in which electrophysiological, histological and
MRI recordings were realized 7 days after MCAO-r, 4) SHAMD1 group (n = 6) in which electrophysiological, histological and
MRI recordings were realized 1 day after the surgery without the
MCAO-r step and 5) SHAM-D7 group (n = 6) in which
electrophysiological, histological and MRI recordings were realized 7 days after the surgery without the MCAO-r step.

The motor reflex regulation at the spinal level is recognized as
an important aspect of the motor control and may be modulated
by cerebral ischemia, despite the fact that controversial results
remain for the upper-extremity control in human studies [16–19].
The Hoffmann reflex (H-reflex) has often been used in preclinical
human and animal studies to explore the spinal sensorimotor
adaptation during and/or after skeletal muscle activity [20,21].
The H-reflex pathway is well-known not to be exclusively affected
by afferent inputs from agonist/antagonist muscles and joints, but
also, by descending motor pathways during movement [22].
However, no evidence indicates that muscular exercise-induced
spinal sensorimotor adaptation could be changed by the MCAO-r
in rats.
Hence, the present study was designed to assess the acute
adaptation of the spinal motor reflex during the 1st week following
MCAO-r. For that purpose, the spinal sensorimotor adaptation
was assessed by measuring the response of triceps brachii H-reflex
before and after isometric exercise on this muscle. It is important
to indicate that physical exercise can be used as a diagnostic tool
revealing new changes in neuromuscular mechanisms adaptations
that cannot be observed in resting condition. Indeed, physical
exercise, as prolonged isometric contraction, was known to
activate the excitatory and/or inhibitory mechanisms responsible
of the motor unit recruitment [23]. In addition, this study aimed at
deepening functional deficits knowledge following MCAO-r that
needs to be clarified. Reproducibility and lesion size at the right
hemisphere level were quantified by histological and magnetic
resonance imagery analysis.
In our study, the different measurements were performed
during the first week post-MCAO-r because the lesion size mainly
evolved during this acute period in rat model [24]. It was
demonstrated that the peak of cerebral damages occurred
24 hours after the lesion [24–26]. Several studies also indicated
that the cerebral lesion size began to be stable from the 7th days
[27–29]. In addition, the processes of cerebral neuronal plasticity
were initiated during the first 24 hours and were increasingly
active during several days post-cerebral ischemia [29,30]. It is
noteworthy to add that the first day post-MCAO-r was considered
to be an optimal time point to start pharmacological treatment or
functional rehabilitation due to the opportune plasticity processes
[3,29,31,32].

2. Surgical procedure: cerebral ischemia by MCAO-r
It is important to note that reproducibility of the induced
deleterious effects by the surgery could be optimized by rigorously
controlling temperature, weight, age, sex, type of used rat and
ischemia duration [33]. Central temperature was maintained at
about 37–38uC with a homeothermic blanket (Homeothermic
Blanket Control Unit, K01345CE, Holliston, MA, USA) driven by
a rectal thermal probe.
Briefly, as described in previous studies [34,35], anaesthesia was
induced with 5% isoflurane and maintained with 2.5-2%
isoflurane through a facemask (Anesteo, Villetelle, France),
supplemented with oxygen. A 0.2 ml injection of 0.5% bupivacaine was subcutaneously performed along the prospective incision
site. A 4 cm ventral midline incision was performed and the right
external, internal, and common carotid arteries (ECA, ICA, CCA)
were exposed without damaging the vagus nerve and its
collaterals. After a partial arteriotomy on ECA with micro-scissors,
a 4-0 monofilament nylon suture (total length: 3 cm; silicon-coated
tip length and diameter: 5 mm and 0.3960.02 mm respectively;
MCAO suture PK10, 40-333PK10, Redland, CA, USA) was
inserted into the ICA via the ECA and approximately pushed
20 mm away from the carotid bifurcation. Blood flow was thus
blocked at the MCA origin. After 120 min of occlusion, the
monofilament was carefully removed and the ICA was permanently closed by electrocoagulation to prevent bleeding. Finally,
the skin was sutured and animals returned in individual cages.

Materials and Methods
1. Animals
Fifty adult male Sprague Dawley rats, weighing exclusively
between 250–270 g (Centre d’Élevage Roger JANVIER, Le
Genest Saint Isle, France), were singly housed in smooth-bottomed
plastic cages in a colony room maintained on a 12-h light/dark
cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. Animals weighting
more than 270 g were excluded from the study. The room
temperature was maintained at 22uC. The weight of the rats was
daily controlled. In order to accustom the animals to the
laboratory environment, an acclimation period of 2 weeks was
allowed before the initiation of the experiment.
Ethics statement. Anesthesia and surgical procedures were
performed according to the French law on animal care guidelines
and the Animal Care Committees of Aix-Marseille Université (AMU)
and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) approved our
protocols. Furthermore, experiments were performed following
the recommendations provided in the Guide for Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals (U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, National Institutes of Health) and in accordance with
the European Community council directive of 24 November 1986

3. Behavioral tests
The severity of functional outcomes following MCAO-r was
assessed by the use of 4 behavioral tests. It also allowed us to test
the reliability of the cerebral ischemia on functional outcomes
between animals (Figure 1).
Elevated body swing test (EBST). The EBST reflects the
lateralization of the lesion (asymmetrical motor behavior)
(Figure 1A). The animal was held approximately 1 cm from
the base of its tail [36]. It was then elevated above the surface in
the vertical axis. A swing was recorded whenever the animal
moved its head out of the vertical axis to either the left or the right
side (more than 10 degrees). Before attempting another swing, the
animal was momentarily placed back on the ground of his cage.
Ten swings were performed for each recording session. The
overall number of swings made to the left side was divided by the
overall number of swings made to both sides. For example, if the
animal performed 7 swings on the left side and 3 swings on the

was normalized with the maximal score, depending on the number
of performed steps. Results were expressed as percentage of PREvalues. For example, if the animal performed 40 steps (maximal
score = 80) and the score including mistakes was 45, the result was
45/80 (successful score = 56%).
Forelimb grip force. The grip force exerted by both
forepaws together and by each forepaw was measured by using
a grip force tester [Grip Strength Tester (GST) bio-GT3, Bioseb,
Vitrolles, France] (Figure 1D). The same experimenter performed all the grip force measurements to obtain more reproducible and reliable data. To standardize the assessment of grip force,
the rat was held by the base of the tail above the bar and was then
moved down until its forelimbs grasped the middle of the bar.
While the body and the lower limbs were horizontally maintained,
the experimenter pulled the rat following the axis of the sensor
(horizontally) until the grasp was released. The trial ended when
the rat released the bar (or failed to establish grip on the GST bar).
During each trial, the maximum force developed by the rat was
obtained just before grip was released. An individual testing trial
lasted 5–7 s. The time interval between each trial was fixed to
1 min to avoid fatigue accumulation. A positive grip was scored
when the digits extended and then flexed upon contacting the bar
followed by the digits being extended when the rat released the
bar. In each session, 15–20 trials were performed and the 4
maximal forces (in grams) were averaged. Moreover, results were
normalized by the weight of the animal (force/weight ratio).
The grip force independently exerted by each paw was
measured with the same experimental procedure, except that the
experimenter held the contralateral paw during the trial to ensure
that the latter paw did not influence the result of the other paw. As
previously mentioned, 15–20 trials were performed and the 4
maximal trials per session were averaged. The left forelimb force
was then normalized by the right forelimb force (L/R ratio).
Finally, each forelimb force was also normalized by the weight of

right side, the score was 7/10 (left swing number/total swing
number = 0.7)
Beam balance test. The beam balance task is a widely used
technique to assess deficits of the vestibulomotor function in
different traumatic situations [37]. The beam balance test in static
position is considered not to be sensitive enough to detect
vestibulomotor alteration after cerebral ischemia [10,37]. In the
present study, this task was modified to increase its sensitivity in
order to detect balance deficits. The forelimbs and the hindlimbs
were respectively positioned on distinct narrow wooden beams
(diameter: 28 mm; space length: 5 cm) (Figure 1B). Therefore,
rats could only balance themselves using their 4 paws excluding
any other body part support. The time to fall off the rod was
recorded. The animals performed 2 trials with a maximum time
fixed at 60 s. Finally, the total recording time was calculated by
adding the time of the two trials.
Ladder-climbing test. The ladder-climbing test is used to
evaluate the sensorimotor capacities to correctly grip the rung
while rats climbed up a inclined ladder (Figure 1C) [38]. In our
study, the ladder was inclined to a 45u angle (length: 100 cm;
width scale: 13 cm). The animals walked across the inclined ladder
with rungs of equal spacing (1 cm). The rats performed 4–5 trials
per testing session. The video analysis of the left paw grip was
recorded with a 100-Hz acquisition frequency using SimiMotion
software (Unterschleissheim, Germany) associated with a numerical camcorder (MV 830i; Canon, Courbevoie, France). The
number of grips of the left paw was counted (20 steps minimum).
Then, the number of mistakes, misses or slips, per crossing was
taken into account. If the grip on the rung was correct, the score
was 2 points. If the rung was completely missed by the left
forepaw, the score was 0 point. If the paw slipped on the rung or
the grip was incomplete, the score was 1 point. Moreover, if the
left paw touched intermediate rungs during the swing phase, the
score was also 1 point. For each testing session, the successful score

motor adaptation after MCAO-r by peripheral nerve stimulation.
In our study, the triceps brachii H-reflex was evoked before and after
an isometric exercise. To evoked the M and H-waves, single
rectangular shocks were directly applied to the intact musculospiral
nerve using a pair of steel hooks with a 1-msec pulse generated by
a constant current stimulator. Stimulation electrodes were located
at ,4 mm of the nerve insertion into the muscle. In accordance
with a previous study [39], the stimulation frequency was fixed at
0.1 Hz to abolish the post-activation depression during the
consecutive H-reflexes recording. The H-reflex was recorded
using bipolar needle electrodes (29-gauge; Oxford, UK; MLA
1204 needle electrodes, 2-mm pin) inserted into the belly of the
triceps brachii muscle. It is noteworthy to add that the location of the
electrodes was never changed throughout the H-reflex recordings
(between the PRE-exercise and the POST-exercise measurements). The triceps brachii was selected because it seemed to be
more appropriate than the other forelimb muscles. Being large and
thick, it facilitates the location of EMG electrodes. Furthermore,
because muscle length is known to influence H-reflex amplitude,
all evoked potentials were recorded for a given elbow angle (i.e.,
110u) [40]. The reflex signal was referred to a ground electrode
implanted in an inert tissue, amplified (2k), and filtered (30 Hz to
10 kHz) with a differential amplifier (P2MP, 5104B, Marseille,
France). The experimental design for H-reflex recording is shown
in Figure 2.
The stabilized maximal M-wave (Mmax) and H-wave (Hmax)
peak-to-peak amplitudes were determined by incrementally
increasing stimulation intensity (by 0.01-mA increments) from
0 mA until there was no further wave amplitude increase.
Stimulation intensity was fixed to obtain Hmax and Mmax. Then,
five H-reflexes were evoked before and five other H-reflexes were
elicited after the isometric exercise. The Hmax/Mmax ratio was
then calculated for each evoked H-reflex and averaged. Changes

4. Electrophysiological measurements
Animal preparation. Rats were anesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of urethane solution (100 mg/100 g). Central
temperature was maintained at about 38uC with a homeothermic
blanket driven by a rectal thermal probe. Animals were positioned
in dorsal decubitus during the surgery and all neuromuscular
measurements. The shoulder and elbow were firmly held by
clamps on a horizontal support to avoid disturbing movements
and to maintain the 120u elbow joint angle during electrical nerve
stimulations. The pectoralis major and minor muscles were removed
and the left musculospiral nerve, innervating the triceps brachii muscle,
was dissected free from surrounding tissues over a length of 3–
4 cm. The other nerves of the brachial plexus were sectioned.
Strain gauge was fixed at the wrist level and was opposed to the
arm movement induced by nerve electrical stimulation.
Isometric exercise. The isometric exercise was characterized by a series of triceps brachii isometric contraction evoked by
electrical musculospiral nerve stimulation (duration: 1 ms; frequency: 10 Hz). A constant current neurostimulator (Digitimer DS7 A;
Welwin, Garden City, Hertforshire, UK) delivered single rectangular shocks to the musculospiral nerve using a pair of steel hooks.
The current intensity used to evoke maximal twitch amplitude was
measured from the beginning of the curve to the peak. The
intensity of the isometric exercise was fixed to 25% of the twitch
amplitude. To measure triceps brachii muscle isometric force, a wire
connected to a strain gauge (Microdynamometer S 60; Houston,
TX, USA) was perpendicularly fixed around the wrist. Contractions were recorded with Biopac MP150 system (sampled at
2,000 Hz, filtered with low pass at 150 Hz) and analyzed with
Biopac AcqKnowledge 3.9 software (Goleta, USA). The isometric
exercise was interrupted when the force fell to 50% of its peak
value (Figure 2). The time of the exercise was measured.

in Hmax/Mmax ratio after exercise were expressed as percentage of
the corresponding Hmax/Mmax ratio before exercise.

5. Histology
Transcardiac perfusion. After electrophysiological recordings, the left cardiac ventricle was exposed and drilled. All animals
were then perfused transcardially (25 ml/min) with 250–300 ml of
0.1 M ice-cold phosphate buffer (7.2,pH,7.4) and followed by
the same volume of 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde
(pH 7.4). Tissues were immediately dissected, post-fixed for 2 h at
4uC in the same fixative buffer and cryoprotected 24 h at 4uC in
30% sucrose. Tissues were then snap-frozen at 240uC for 10 s in
Isopentane solution and stored at 280uC [41]. The next step
consisted to perform coronal sections of rat brain (slide thickness:
30 mm).
Cresyl violet staining. Cresyl violet staining is commonly
used method to quantify experimental brain infarctions. Sections
were rinsed in distilled water for 5 min and incubated 3 min in a
cresyl violet bath. Sections were then dehydrated through a
sequence of ethanol baths (70, 95, and 100%). Sections were
finally cleaned in Xylene during 2 min and medium mounted with
coverslip using Permount (Fair Lawn,NJ, USA). For each section,
the infarction area and total area of each hemisphere were
delimitated and calculated with ImageJ software [42].

Results
The rat weight decreased between 11% and 19% after MCAOr throughout protocol duration while the weight of SHAM rats
was similar to the one of Control rats.
No difference was observed from PRE to D7 in Control and
SHAM-D7 groups for all the measured behavioral parameters,
except for grip force (g) in SHAM-D7 (see below: 4.). Likewise, no
difference was observed between these 2 groups.
Results of the behavioral assessment obtained in MCAO-D1
group were similar to the ones of the MCAO-D7 group at D1
(MCAO-D1 group results, see Table 1). No difference was
observed between Control and SHAM-D1 groups.

1. Elevated body swing test (EBST)
The animals exclusively straightened up on the left side during
the 7 days post-MCAO-r. Indeed, the left swing number/total
swing number was significantly higher from D1 to D7 compared
to PRE in MCAO-D7 group (PRE = 0.660.17; from D1 to
D7 = 1; p,0.001). (Figure 3). The left swing number/total swing
number observed in the MCAO-D7 group was significantly higher
than Control and SHAM-D7 groups from D1 to D7 (p,0.001).

6. Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI)
Anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane and maintained
with 2–2.5% isoflurane through a facemask, supplemented with
oxygen. The MRI experiments were performed in a horizontal
Bruker Biospec 4.7-T (Bruker Biospec Avance 4.7T/30, Bruker,
Ettlingen, Germany). The core temperature was maintained close
to 37uC by circulating warm water in a heating pad placed under
the torso. Breathing rate was also monitored throughout the MRI
study. The animal head was secured by ear and tooth bars to limit
movement. Then, the surface coil was placed above the head for
brain imaging. Two types of measurements were performed: 1)
Twenty coronal slices were from T2 weighing (contiguous slices;
TE: 50 ms; slice thickness: 1 mm; matrix: 2566256 pixels; field of
view: 40640 mm2). By the use of the ImageJ software, the regions
of interest were selected manually. The edema volume was
compared to the right hemisphere volume and to the total brain
volume. 2) Twenty coronal slices were from T2* weighing
(contiguous slices; TE: 15 ms; idem for the other parameters) to
observe blood accumulation (intracerebral hemorrhages) [43].

2. Beam balance test
The balance deficits persisted after 7 days post-MCAO-r. The
balance time on the rod in the MCAO-D7 group from D1 to D7
was strongly inferior to PRE values (p,0.001) (Figure 4).
However, the balance time was significantly higher from D4 to
D7 (36639 s; 67639 s; 58632 s; 76634 s respectively) compared
to D1, D2 and D3 (p,0.001). The balance time was significantly
shorter from D1 to D7 in MCAO-D7 than Control and SHAMD7 groups (p,0.001).

3. Ladder-climbing test
The animals showed strong difficulties to climb and grip the
ladder with the left paw during 7 days post-MCAO-r. Indeed, the
successful score significantly decreased from D1 to D7 in MCAOD7 group compared to PRE (p,0.001) (Figure 5). Moreover, the
successful score was significantly higher from D5 to D7
(0.4460.09; 0.5760.14; 0.5960.12 respectively) compared to
D1-D4 (0.2160.20; 0.1960.13; 0.1660.18; 0.2060.22 respectively; p,0.001 for all values). The successful score was
significantly lower in MCAO-D7 group from D1 to D7 than
Control and SHAM-D7 groups (p,0.001).

7. Experimental protocol
In a first step, rats were familiarized with the elevated body
swing test, the beam balance test, the ladder-climbing test and the
forelimb grip force by training them 4 times a week during 1 week.
Then these behavioral tests were realized once before the surgery
(PRE) and daily after it from the 1st day to the 7th day (D1, D2,
D3, D4, D5, D6 and D7). The H-reflex recordings before and
after isometric exercise were performed at D1 for MCAO-D1 and
SHAM-D1 groups, but also, at D7 for MCAO-D7 and SHAM-D7
groups. Finally after electrophysiological measurements, the size of
cerebral infarction was measured by histological analysis with
Cresyl violet staining. To be more complete, the size of cerebral
edema was measured by MRI on 1 Control rat, 1 SHAM rat and
2 MCAO-r rats at D1 and D7.

4. Forelimb grip force
The force decreased after MCAO-r but increased when the
force was normalized to the body weight.
Changes in grip force exerted by both forepaws
throughout protocol. The force (g) significantly increased in

SHAM-D7 group at D3, D4, D6 and D7 (11486143 g;
11486160 g; 11236186 g; 11356158 g respectively, p,0.05)
compared to PRE (994658 g). However, when the force was
normalized by the rat’s weight (force/weight), no difference was
observed in SHAM-D7 group during the protocol, as in Control
group. A decrease of force for the MCAO-D7 group was noticed
between PRE and D2, D4, D5, D6, D7 whereas no difference was
observed at D1 and D3 (927653 g; 881692 g respectively,

Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaStat software
program (Statistical software, San Jose, CA, USA). All data are

The L/R ratio (Left/Right). The PRE L/R ratio of the
MCAO-D7 group significantly decreased compared to the D1 and
D2 L/R ratio (PRE: 1.160.1; D1 and D2: 0.860.1; p,0.001 for
both) (Figure 7). The L/R ratio in the MCAO-D7 group was
lower than in the Control at D1 and D2 (PRE: 0.960.04; D1:
0.960.1; D2: 1.060.1; p,0.01 for both) and in the SHAM-D7
(PRE: 0.960.1; D1: 1.060.1; D2: 1.060.2; p,0.001 for both)
groups.
The left forepaw force. The force in the MCAO-D7 group
was significantly lower from D1 to D7 (358636 g; 344654 g;
356657 g; 342681 g for D1, D2, D6 and D7 respectively; p,
0.001; 419632 g; 387655 g; 390641 g for D3, D4 and D5
respectively; p,0.05) compared to PRE (475651 g). The ForceL/
Weight ratio significantly decreased at D1 (p,0.01) and D2 (p,
0.001) compared to D3 in MCAO-D7 group (data not shown). The
force (g) in MCAO-D7 group was significantly lower than Control
and SHAM-D7 groups from D1 to D7 (p,0.05), except for D3
(data not shown).
The right forepaw force. Contrary to the force decline
observed at D7 compared to PRE (450638 g, p,0.05), D1

p = 0.07)(Figure 6A). However, the force/weight ratio was
increased in MCAO-D7 group at D1, D3, D4, D5, D6 and D7
(927653 g; 881692 g; 847627 g; 849657 g; 821675 g;
837667 g
respectively;

compared
to
PRE
(963680 g)(Figure 6B). Moreover, the observed force at D1 in
MCAO-D7 group was significantly higher than the force at D2
(p,0.05).
Changes in grip force exerted by both forepaws between
groups. The force in MCAO-D7 group was significantly lower

from D2 to D7 than Control (p,0.01) and SHAM-D7 (p,0.001)
groups, except at D3 where the force in MCAO-D7 group was
only lower than SHAM-D7 group (p,0.001)(Figure 6A). The
force/weight ratio for MCAO-D7 group was higher at D5, D6
and D7 than the force/weight ratio for Control (p,0.01, p,0.01
and p,0.001 respectively) and for SHAM-D7 groups (p,0.05,
p,0.05 and p,0.01 respectively)(Figure 6B).
Changes in grip force exerted by each forepaws. As
described below, the modified grip force production was associated
with a force decline of the left forelimb and an increase of right
forelimb force.

Isometric exercise. The duration of exercise was decreased
after 2-hour MCAO-r from the first day until the end of the
protocol. The times of isometric exercise to reach -50% of the peak
value in MCAO-D1 (68622 s) and MCAO-D7 (73616 s) groups
were significantly shorter (p,0.01) than SHAM-D1 (171673 s),

difference was observed between SHAM-D1, SHAM-D7 and
Control (Figure 8).

5. Electrophysiology: H-reflex response before and after
isometric exercise
The right MCAO-r induced a change in the motor reflex
regulation after isometric exercise of the contralateral triceps
brachii muscle one day, but not seven days after the cerebral
infarction. It was also found that there was an earlier muscle
fatigue during exercise after such injury.

H-reflex before and after isometric exercise. The measured H-reflex in resting condition was not modified after
ischemia. However, the H-reflex response to isometric exercise
was altered one day after lesion and was recovered 7 days after the
lesion. Indeed, the Hmax/Mmax ratio after isometric exercise
decreased significantly in Control (240627%), SHAM-D1 (2
44628%), SHAM-D7 (242623%) and MCAO-D7 (242624%)

cerebral ischemia through the analysis of behavioral tests assessing

cerebral edema was observed at the right hemisphere without
affecting the left one from T2 weighting (Figure 12 A/B). For the
first rat, edema covered 51% of the right hemisphere and 27% of
total brain at D1. The edema volume showed a 29% decline at D7
when compared to the right hemisphere volume, and, a 30%
decline when compared to the total brain volume. For the second
rat, the edema volume was similar to the first rat at D1 and D7
(Table 2). Moreover, no cerebral hemorrhage was observed for
these rats from T2* slices (Figure 12 C/D). No sign of lesion
appeared in the SHAM and Control animals.

1. Methodological considerations
The similar results obtained in Control and SHAM groups
confirmed that the MCAO-r surgery without cerebral ischemia
did not influence the recorded neuromuscular parameters.
Furthermore, the results of different behavioral tests for Control
and SHAM groups were not modified throughout the protocol
meaning that these measurements were reliable during one week.
However, the increased grip force of both forelimbs in the SHAM
group during the first week post-surgery could be associated with
stress often present after surgical procedure [44]. Nevertheless, this
result stayed opposed to the one observed in cerebral lesioned
animals. The observed functional deficits could thus be related
with the MCAO-r effects in our study.
Looking at the infarct volume (Cresyl violet staining), the
MCAO-r reliably affected the right hemisphere and thus induced
a reproducible lesion. In addition, the histological analysis by
Cresyl violet staining indicated that the infarct volume showed a
tendency to decrease between D1 and D7 confirming previous
studies [28,31,45]. Although MRI was performed on few rats,
cerebral edema clearly showed an increase one day after MCAO-r
and decreased at the 7th day that was in accordance with previous
studies [25,27]. The infarct volume could be explained by the fact
that the edema exacerbated the lesion size. Being maximal at one
day post-ischemia, the edema accentuated the lesion size while
decreasing it at the end of the first week. We could suggest that the
spinal sensorimotor adaptation was assessed on animals with a
similar cerebral lesion in our study.
Several methodological criteria were respected to evoke triceps
brachii H-reflex and ensured that the recording conditions of Hreflex were similar for each animal in our study: 1) H-wave
progressively increased from the first deflection to the maximal Hwave amplitude when the stimulation intensity was incremented,
as previously described [46], 2) the stimulation intensity to elicit
Hmax was higher than or equal to the stimulation intensity

Discussion
The main results of the present study indicated that the right
MCAO-r induced a change in the motor reflex regulation after
isometric exercise of the contralateral triceps brachii muscle. The rats
that underwent a 2-hour cerebral ischemia displayed an earlier
muscle fatigue during isometric exercise throughout the protocol.

necessary to elicit Mmax [47], 3) H-reflex was not abolished when
electrical stimulation was applied at Mmax intensity, 4) M-wave
amplitude was always higher than H-wave regardless of the
stimulation intensity and 5) the latency between M- and H-waves
was similar during the different recordings for each animal. It
seems important to notice that the location of recording
intramuscular electrodes was not modified during the experiments
to ensure a reliable comparison between the PRE- and POSTexercise recordings. Moreover, the Hmax/Mmax ratio limited the
influence of muscle membrane excitability that could change the
interpretation of H-reflex results [40].

2. The motor reflex response to exercise is disturbed after
MCAO-r
The H-reflex, obtained before exercise, was not modified by
cerebral ischemia. This result was in agreement with a previous
study on humans in which no difference of the extensor carpi radialis
longus and flexor carpi radialis H-reflex in resting condition was
detected after stroke injury [19]. Other study showed an opposite
result by measuring an increase in H-reflex after stroke injury [18].
Such controversial observation between these two studies may be
explained by different methodological approach for measuring Hreflex (Hmax amplitude vs. Hslope/Mslope and Hmax/Mmax). It
suggests that the synaptic transmission between large diameter
afferent fibers (group I and II) and a-motoneurons seems not to be
altered following MCAO-r.
However, the H-reflex response to exercise was changed one
day after lesion. Indeed, contrary to the H-reflex response of the
reference groups (Control and SHAM) that strongly decreased
after isometric exercise, the motor reflex response of the injured
rats remained stable after exhaustive exercise. To explain this
result, we suggested that the neural network activated during
exercise and regulating the H-reflex response in the spinal cord
might be modified after MCAO-r. Indeed, the regulation of the Hreflex amplitude is associated with the activity of motor descending
pathways and with the afferents of the active muscle. It was also

Motor Reflex Alteration after Cerebral Ischemia

In our study, the recovery of the ability to climb and grip the
ladder stayed incomplete at the end of the protocol. It was in
accordance to a previous study that demonstrated an increase in
foot fault (53.4%) following a 2-hour occlusion [10]. Several
reasons might explain this result such as a deficit in propulsion,
inter-limb coordination and an alteration of proprioception of the
left forelimb muscles [38]. However, the respective contribution of
these different mechanisms stayed difficult to quantify and should
thus be further clarified.
Animals were not able to maintain balance on the wooden
beams during the first 2 days following the MCAO-r suggesting
vestibulomotor deficits. Moreover, we observed that rats were
systematically oriented on the left side inducing an important loss
of balance. Therefore, the motor asymmetry may contribute to
affect static balance on beams. Our results allowed us to observe a
progressive (incomplete) recovery of balance in static position from
the 4th day post-ischemia. Several studies considered that the beam
balance test was not sensitive enough to detect changes in balance
after cerebral ischemia [10,37]. However, we performed a simple
methodological modification for this test. We left a 5 cm space
between the 2 wooden beams in order to force rats only to use
their paws and not their belly that could strongly disturb balance
results. Our methodological modification of the beam balance test
may be considered in further studies to optimize the assessment of
functional disorders.
A loss of force exerted by both forelimbs has already been
observed in few studies after MCAO-r, but some controversial
results remain [14,55,56]. Therefore, the force measurement was
deepened in the present study. Our results indicated that the loss
of weight resulting from MCAO-r seemed to play an important
role for the force production. Indeed, we observed that the force
exerted by both forelimbs showed an opposite pattern that is an
increase when the force was normalized to the rat weight. Thus,
we suggest that the weight should be systematically taken into
account for force measurements.
Interestingly, the force exerted by the left forelimb showed
opposite response to the one produced by the right forelimb. The
force of the left forelimb showed a light decrease when the weight
of the animal was taken into account. The absence of a substantial
loss of force (contrary to human outcomes) may be explained by
the fact that the MCAO-r did not directly affect the motor cortex
area, but mainly disturbed cerebral structures, such as the striatum
or the thalamus, involved in the regulation of motor activity
[11,57]. In parallel, the force produced by the right forelimb
(normalized by the weight) significantly increased during protocol.
The compensation observed at the right forelimb level might
represent a major force adaptation following transient focal
cerebral ischemia in rats. The motor asymmetry, revealed this
time by the L/R ratio, only lasted a couple of days and may be
linked to the short-lasting decrement of left forelimb force.
In addition, it is noteworthy to add that the animals showed
difficulties to grip the bar with the left forepaw when using it
separately to the right paw. However, such difficulties were not
observed when animals used both left and right forepaws. It might
mean that the sum of the force exerted separately by each forelimb
partially reflected the force produced by forelimbs together. It
could be suggested with caution that the increment of force
exerted by both forelimbs (when normalized by the weight) was
associated with the increase of the right forelimb force.

found that the afferents from antagonist and/or synergic muscles
and cutaneous/articular afferents could change the H-reflex
amplitude [22]. In our study, the nerves of the synergic and
antagonist muscles of the triceps brachii were sectioned to avoid the
influence of their afferent fibers during H-reflex recordings.
Consequently, the mechanisms involving the surrounding muscles
of the triceps brachii did not contribute to adjust the motor reflex
activity after the isometric exercise.
Given that the isometric exercise was exhaustive, the active
muscle may accumulate metabolite known to activate the muscle
afferents from groups I, II (mechanosensitive), III and IV
(mechano- and metabosensitive) [23,48]. In addition, cerebral
damages may disturb descending pathways regulating motor
response at the spinal reflex [3]. Consequently, the H-reflex
response to exercise might be associated with changes of
descending pathway activity on triceps brachii motoneurons and/
or changes of the triceps brachii muscle afferent activity. Neural
mechanisms underlying H reflex response to exercise remains to
determine in further studies.

3. The H-reflex response to exercise seemed to recover at
the end of the first week post-cerebral ischemia
The H-reflex response to isometric exercise was normalized as
soon as the first week post-MCAO-r. Indeed, the Hmax/Mmax ratio
decreased after exercise one-week post-MCAO-r as in the
reference groups. It means that the mechanisms underlying the
motor reflex regulation evolved during the first week postischemia. The interpretation of such result needs caution because
we could not affirm that the regulation of motor reflex returned to
the same pre-injury state. The decrease of H-reflex after exercise
could be associated with other neural mechanisms compared to
control animals resulting in a similar H-reflex profile. Further
studies are needed to clarify such neural strategy.

4. MCAO-r induced more important muscle fatigue from
the first day
Our results confirmed that a disturbed motor control was
associated with greater muscle fatigability after focal cerebral
ischemia [49]. The well-known muscle atrophy and myotypology
changes could not be responsible of such result the one-day after
occlusion [50]. However, the observed fatigue could be partially
explained by the modification of motor reflex activity affecting the
motoneuronal recruitment. Indeed, it was demonstrated that force
decline induced by exhaustive exercise could, to a certain degree,
be explained by modification of the motor reflex response [51,52].
Nevertheless, several authors demonstrated that one week after 1hour cerebral ischemia induced a loss of muscle mass that affected
both type II and type I muscle fibers [50]. The isometric exerciseinduced fatigue, observed 7 days after MCAO-r, may be related to
muscle atrophy and/or myotypology changes.

5. Functional deficits were maintained during the acute
phase after MCAO-r
The elevated body swing test results indicated for the first time
that 2-hour cerebral ischemia induced a strong motor asymmetry
without any signs of recovery. Previous studies shown that a 1hour cerebral occlusion induced a preferential and stable left
orientation in 85% of trials (from 1 day to 2 months post MCAOr) [36,53]. After a 30 min focal ischemia, the orientation of swing
stayed on the left side but could be inferior to 75% of trials [54].
Therefore, our study suggests that the duration of MCAO
influences the severity of motor asymmetry.

Conclusion and Clinical Perspectives
To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to
show an alteration of the motor reflex regulation following

MCAO-r. The neuromuscular adaptations in the acute and
chronic phases should be more investigated, as they are essential to
understand the neural modulations following severe cerebral
ischemia [3]. Consequently, the assessment of treatments should
be optimized and more complete. Our study also indicated that
the MCAO-r method allowed clarifying the neuromuscular
adaptations in the acute phase.
In addition, this study confirmed that the use of the physical
exercise as a diagnostic tool could reveal neuromuscular changes
that cannot be found in resting condition. Indeed, the alteration of
the motor reflex regulation could not be detected without the use
of the isometric exercise during electrophysiological recordings.

The exercise as a model should be more taken into account in
further studies.
