Abstract
BNG-1 is a herb complex used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat stroke. In this
study, we attempted to identify the neuroprotective mechanism of BNG-1 by using
neuroimaging and neurotrophin analyses of a stroke animal model. Rats were
treated with either saline or BNG-1 for 7 d after 60-min middle cerebral artery
occlusion by filament model. The temporal change of magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging of brain was studied using a 7 Tesla MR imaging (MRI) system and the
temporal expressions of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) in brain were analyzed before operation
and at 4 h, 2 d, and 7 d after operation. Compared with the saline group, the BNG-1
group exhibited a smaller infarction volume in the cerebral cortex in T2 image from
as early as 4 h to 7 d, less edema in the cortex in diffusion weighted image from 2
to 7 d, earlier reduction of postischemic hyperperfusion in both the cortex and
striatum in perfusion image at 4 h, and earlier normalization of the ischemic pattern
in the striatum in susceptibility weighted image at 2 d. NT-3 and BDNF levels were
higher in the BNG-1 group than the saline group at 7 d. We concluded that the
protective effect of BNG-1 against cerebral ischemic injury might act through
improving cerebral hemodynamics and recovering neurotrophin generation.

The Neuroprotective Mechanism of BNG-1

Introduction
Stroke is a major cause of death worldwide. The prevention of stroke risk factors
can decrease the incidence and mortality of stroke. However, most stroke
survivors may suffer from irreversible neurological damage that decreases their
quality of life. The effects of many neuroprotective agents on acute stroke have
been investigated by clinical trials, but unfortunately only thrombolytic therapy
administered in a narrow time window improves neurological outcomes after
acute ischemic stroke [1, 2].
BNG-1 is a herb complex used in traditional Chinese medicine that has been
used in ischemic stroke therapy for hundreds of years in southern China [3].
BNG-1 consists of 8 components: Scutellaria Radix (6%), Angelica Radix (12%)
Coptis Rhizome (12%), Glycyrrhiza Radix (12%), Bupleuri Radix (14%), Ginseng
Radix (14%), Astragali Radix (14%), and Bambusa Concretio Silicea (16%) [3].
Compounds in these components exhibit neuroprotective properties against
cerebral ischemic injury through antiplatelet or antiinflammation action [4–13].
BNG-1 is currently undergoing a Phase III double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled, multicenter study to compare the functional outcomes and safety of
treatment with BNG-1-aspirin with those of aspirin treatment in ischemic stroke
recovery (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01675115).
A pharmacodynamic study revealed that BNG-1 is a phosphodiesterase (PDE)
inhibitor, which exhibited predominant PDE1 inhibition as well as weak PDE3
and PDE6 inhibition [3]. PDE1 regulates vascular contractile function and
vascular remodeling [14]. However, few in vivo PDE1 functional studies have
been published, particularly in the ischemic stroke field. It has been proposed that
PDE1 inhibitor increases neurotrophin expression through the phosphorylation
of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (CREB)
[15]. Therefore, we hypothesized that BNG-1 is beneficial in restoring cerebral
hemodynamics and neurotrophin levels after cerebral ischemia. This study was
intended to identify the temporal change in cerebral hemodynamics by using
magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion/perfusion imaging and neurotrophin protein/
mRNA levels in rats treated with BNG-1 after transient focal cerebral ischemia.

Materials and Methods
Animal
The animal experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of Chang Gung University and Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital, Taiwan. Two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the
longitudinal MR imaging (MRI) study; one group was treated with BNG-1 and
the other was treated with saline (n58 in each group). To assess the temporal
changes in neurotrophin protein and mRNA, more groups of male rats were used
to form a sham operation group (n58), and groups that were tested 4 h, 2 d, and
7 d after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (n58 for each time point for the

BNG-1 and saline groups). The rats were 12 to 16 wk old and their body weight
was 250 to 320 g.

Middle cerebral artery occlusion model
Transient left MCA occlusion for 60 min was used as an acute ischemic model
according to our previous method [16]. Before the surgical procedure, rats were
quickly anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in a mixture of air with nitrous oxide and
oxygen (69%/30%) and then 1.5% isoflurane was maintained during the
experiments. The proximal portion of the external carotid artery (ECA) was
tightly ligated with a silk suture. A 20-mm 4-0 nylon surgical thread was inserted
from the left ECA into the internal carotid artery (ICA) to occlude the MCA. The
left common carotid artery (CCA) was then permanently ligated and the wound
was temporarily closed. Anesthesia was discontinued after these procedures were
complete. After a 60-min occlusion of the left MCA, the rat was anesthetized
again, and the wound was opened to remove the nylon surgical thread for the
reperfusion of the MCA. In the sham operation group, similar procedures were
conducted without ligation or occlusion of any vessel. Endovascular suture
occlusion of the MCA for 60 min would result in irreversible cerebral ischemic
injury in both the cerebral cortex and striatum [17]. Therefore, we only included
animals that exhibited right-side weakness with upper-limb dominance and had
infarction in both the striatum and cortex for the study. The rats with only striatal
infarction detected by T2-weighted image on the second day after MCA occlusion
were excluded from the study (n511).
During ischemia, rectal temperature was monitored in all the animals and was
maintained at approximately 37 ˚C with a heating pad and an overhead lamp.
After restoration of blood flow, the animals were allowed to recover at ambient
temperatures (21 ˚C to 23 ˚C). All the rats used in this study were disinfected with
iodine before surgery. After surgery, the surgical wound was checked for signs of
infection every 2 days, and gentamycin was administered if there was evidence of
wound infection. In addition, 0.3 to 0.5 mg/100 g of meperidine was injected
intramuscularly if any symptoms of pain were observed.
Rats were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane in a mixture of air with nitrous oxide
and oxygen (69%/30%) before being euthanized. Rats were quickly decapitated
and their brains were removed for further experiments.

BNG-1
BNG-1 was provided as a dry powder by Braingenesis Biotechnology, Ltd, and was
dissolved in saline as a vehicle. The oral administration dose of BNG-1 was 1 g/kg
at a volume of 10 ml/kg immediately after removal of the nylon surgical thread
from ICA and closure of surgical wound, and then every 24 hours for 7
consecutive days [3]. The control group was operated with the same procedure
except treated with saline.

The Neuroprotective Mechanism of BNG-1

Immunohistochemistry
Three neurotrophins, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF), were immunostained according to the
protocol described in [16]. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase method (Vector Labs.,
Burlingame, CA, USA) was used for immunostaining. Briefly, a cycle of brain
specimen was cut at a thickness of 20 mm for 10 consecutive slices, and then at a
thickness of 400 mm for one slice. Total 20 cycles covering infarcted brain region
of 12 mm in length were collected for immunohistochemistry (20 mm) and
western blot/polymerase chain reactions (PCR) (400 mm), respectively. After the
fresh frozen sections were fixated in ice-cold acetone, they were incubated for one
night at 4 ˚C with the first antibodies and were then reacted for 1 h with the
biotinylated second antibodies. We used 3,39-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.02% H2O2 for tissue staining. The average optical intensity of
immunoreactivity at lesion and non-lesion cortex was calculated from a total of 20
slices per rat, and eight rats at each time point were included for the analysis.

Western blot
Western blots of NT-3, BDNF, and NGF were studied according to the method
described in [18]. The rat cortex was homogenated and the protein content of the
supernatant was estimated with an absorbance of 560 nm by using a bicinchoninic
acid protein assay reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). After electrophoresis
and protein transfer to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, the membrane was
stained with primary and secondary antibodies. After these procedures were
complete, the membrane was reacted in a chemiluminescence reagent (Western
LightningTM, Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.,
MA, USA). It was then exposed to a high-performance chemiluminescence film
(Amersham Biosciences, England, UK) to measure the optical intensity.
A fluorescence imaging system (Vilber Lourmat, France) was used to quantify
the immunoreactivity and western blots according to the method described in
[19]. The background optical intensity of the area near the examined cortical area
and the immunoreactive band was measured. The optical intensity ratio of the
ischemic cortex to that of the sham operation was determined after subtracting
the background intensity. The means ¡ SDs of these values were calculated and
were statistically compared at each time point between the 2 groups. Eight rats
were included at each time point for the analysis.

TaqMan real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain
reaction
Real time reverse-transcription (RT) polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) for NT-3,
BDNF, and NGF were conducted according to the protocol described in [19].
RNA was isolated from the cortex of each rat after mincing with TRIzol reagent
(Life Technologies, NY, USA). Chloroform was used to extract RNA, and the
RNA was purified twice by using RNeasy minicolumns. RT-PCR performed using

a TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) and an ABI
Prism 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, USA) was used to
measure transcript encoding for NT-3, BDNF, and NGF. 18S rRNA transcript was
used as internal control gene and was amplified in a separate tube to normalize for
variance in input RNA. The 2(2Delta Delta C(T)) relative quantification method
was used to measure the level of mRNA [20]. The mRNA ratio of the ischemic
cortex to that of the sham operation rats was determined. The means ¡ SDs of
these ratios were calculated and were statistically compared at each time point
between the 2 groups. Eight rats were included at each time point for the analysis.

Magnetic resonance imaging method
Inhalation of a nitrous oxide/oxygen/isoflurane mixture (69%/30%/1.5%) was
used to anesthetize the rats before MRI. After exposing the inguinal area, a
biomedical silicone catheter (external diameter of 0.64 mm) was cannulated into
the left femoral vein to administer the MR contrast agent. During an MR scan, the
rats were placed in the prone position with head fixed in a reproducible position
in a nonmagnetic cradle by using an appropriate spacer.
The MR images were obtained using a 7T Clinscan animal MRI system with a
bore size of 30 cm (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). A volume resonator with a
diameter of 72 mm was used for radio frequency transmission and a 4-channel
phased array coil optimized for rat brains was used to receive signals. A T2weighted turbo spin echo sequence was applied to cover most of the brain regions
of interest with 20 coronal slices that used the following imaging parameters: TR/
TE52920 ms/38 ms, ETL57, slice thickness51 mm, matrix size52566256, inplane resolution50.14860.148 mm2. From these images, five slice locations
(2 mm thick) were selected based on a bregma of 0.4 mm and an interaural
distance of 8.6 mm for T2-weighted imaging with set imaging parameters used for
diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI.
DTI used a spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TR/TE53000 ms/
34 ms, matrix size51286128, in-plane resolution50.360.3 mm2, averages53)
with diffusion gradients applied in 30 directions (b5600 and 1200 mm/s2).
Parallel imaging was applied using generalized autocalibrating partially parallel
acquisitions with an acceleration factor of 2. The apparent diffusion coefficient
(ADC) maps were calculated using the DTI images. Perfusion weighted imaging
was conducted using a gradient-echo EPI sequence (TR/TE/FA5600 ms/10 ms/
50 ˚, matrix size51286128, in-plane resolution50.360.3 mm, acceleration
factor52). An amount of 0.3 mL MR contrast media (0.15 mmol dimeglumine
gadopentetate contrast; Magnevist, Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany) was
administered in 3 s at the seventh measurement. DSC-MRI data were processed
using nICE software (Nordic ICE, NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway). The
arterial input function was semi-automatically obtained from voxels around right
MCA (contralateral to the occlusion side) in each animal, based on criteria
including peak height and rising time of the concentration time curve. Relative
CBF (relCBF) maps were then generated using a SVD deconvolution method [21].

The Neuroprotective Mechanism of BNG-1

Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) was performed between the DWI and DSC
scans by using a flow-compensated 3-dimensional gradient-echo sequence with
the following parameters: TR/TE/FA533 ms/18 ms/40 ˚, matrix size55126512,
in-plane resolution50.07860.078 mm, average52). Thirty-two 0.5-mm-thick
coronal slices were obtained from the acquisition slab. Maximum intensity
projection (MIP) images were then calculated to generate slices with identical
locations and thicknesses as the ADC and CBF maps. Brain MR scans were
longitudinally examined in all rats 1 d before and 4 h, 2 d, and 7 d after MCA
occlusion.

Measurement of infarction volume
All the 20 slices of T2-weighted images at each time point (4 h, 2 d, and 7 d) after
left MCA occlusion were used for calculation of infarction volume. The area with
high signal intensity in cortical and striatal brain regions was identified and
measured using Mongo software (Research Imaging Institute, San Antonio, TX,
USA). A diffusion weighted images (b51000 mm/s2) were used to identify
ventricle regions filled with cerebrospinal fluid and were substracted from the
infarction areas. We collected 20 coronal slices of T2-weighted images (i.e. 1 mm
apart) totally covering the brain region of 2.0 cm in length. The total infarction
area (mm2) of cortex and striatum in each coronal slice of each animal was
measured and corrected to exclude the effect of brain edema [corrected infarction
area5actual infarction area 6 (non-lesion hemisphere area/lesion hemisphere
area)]. The infarction volume (mm3) was then calculated by corrected infarction
area (mm2)6specific distance (1 mm) in altogether 20 slices and was expressed as
mean ¡ standard deviation (SD) for each rat. As our previous study had shown
there was good correlation between histological damage and MR infarction size
[22], the MR infarction volume was used to compare statistically between saline
and BNG-1 groups.

Analysis of the parameters on magnetic resonance images
In the ADC, MIP of SWI, and CBF measurements, a template of four
predetermined regions of interest at the bilateral parietal cortex and striatum was
applied for the spatial transformation analysis based on T2-weighted MR images
[23] according to our previous method [24]. The spatial transformation
procedure was conducted using SPM5 software (Wellcome Department of
Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) implemented in Matlab 7.0 (Mathworks Inc,
Sherborn, MA, USA). For the ADC, MIP of SWI, and the CBF map, the mean
values obtained in the bilateral parietal cortex and the bilateral striatum calculated
from all the pre-operation rat brains were used as a baseline value. The low values
on the ADC and MIP images and high values on the CBF images (after subtracting
the baseline values) were analyzed for every post-operation brain image. In all 5
slices, the ADC, MIP, and CBF images covering a brain region of 1.4 cm in length
were used to identify and measure the area (mm2) with ischemia-related changes

in the left hemisphere using Mongo software (Research Imaging Institute, San
Antonio, TX, USA) at 4 h, 2 d, and 7 d after left MCA occlusion. The volumes
(mm3) of low signal intensity on the ADC and MIP images and high signal
intensity on the CBF images were calculated by area (mm2)6specific distance
(2 mm) in altogether 5 slices for each rat and were expressed as means ¡ SDs at
each time point. The volume of the ADC, MIP intensity, and CBF change were
statistically compared between saline and BNG-1 groups.

Statistical analysis
The researchers who performed the MCA occlusion model (SL Liao) and the
analysis of MR images and neurotrophin expression (YT Lee) were blind to the
oral administration of BNG-1 or saline (BH Peng). The immunoreactivity,
western blot, and RT-PCR optical intensity ratios as well as the volume of the
ADC, MIP, and CBF signal intensity changes in MR images were compared
between saline and BNG-1 groups at each time point by Mann-Whitney U test.
Kruskal-Wallis test (non-parametric one-way ANOVA) with LSD post-hoc test
was used to compare each time point to pre-operation value in saline and BNG-1
groups. Statistical significance was defined as P,0.05. SPSS (Version 13) software
was used to examine the statistics.

Results
The infarction volume measured using the T2-weighted image is presented in
Fig. 1. The BNG-1 group exhibited a significantly lower infarction volume in the
lesion hemisphere compared with the saline group, from as early as 4 h to 7 d
after MCA occlusion. If the cortex and striatum were compared separately, the
infarction volume decreased significantly only in the cortex, and not in the
striatum, of the BNG-1 group (BNG-1 vs. saline group in the cortex: 3.5¡7.8 vs.
49.0¡34.0 mm3 at 4 h, P50.019; 31.1¡42.0 vs. 117.1¡69.8 mm3 at 2 d,
P50.011; 14.2¡19.7 vs. 88.4¡58.2 mm3 at 7 d, P50.008). However, no
significant difference occurred in the striatum at any time point (P.0.05). The
temporal change of T2-weighted images showed a significant increase of
infarction volume from post-operation 4 h to 7 d and most severe at 2 d
compared with pre-operation (P,0.05) in both groups.
The volume analysis of the ADC signal intensity change is presented in Fig. 2.
The BNG-1 group exhibited a significantly lower volume of low signal intensity on
the lesion cortex compared with the saline group at 2 and 7 days after MCA
occlusion (BNG-1 vs. saline group: 41.7¡30 vs. 115.9¡57.3 mm3 at 2 d,
P50.033; 6.1¡0.4 vs. 29.3¡10.1 mm3 at 7 d, P50.022). At 7 d, the BNG-1 group
also reflected a significantly lower volume of low signal intensity on the lesion
striatum compared with the saline group (BNG-1 vs. saline group: 29.3¡8 vs.
44.6¡1.6 mm3 at 7 d, P50.031). The temporal change of ADC images showed a

Discussion
In a previous animal study, a permanent surgical occlusion in an MCA model
demonstrated a reduction of the infarction volume in the cortical area after BNG1 treatment [3]. In the present study, we used a distinct method with transient
endovascular suture occlusion in an MCA model [16], which injured both cortical
and subcortical areas, and find out that BNG-1 mainly provides a protective effect
in the cortical area and less likely in the striatum. This protective effect occurred
from as early as 4 h after the first dose of BNG-1 and remained 7 d after MCA
occlusion (Fig. 1). These results suggested that the first dose of BNG-1
administered immediately after ischemic injury can induce neuroprotection, and

this protective effect can be maintained with continuous post-operation treatment
of BNG-1.
A study demonstrated that the PDE1 inhibitor, vinpocetine, increased cerebral
perfusion and oxygen extraction in stroke patients [25]. However, a meta-analysis
of vinpocetine in acute ischemic stroke did not support its efficacy because of a
lack of high-quality study designs [26]. BNG-1 is a PDE1 inhibitor [3]. It is likely
that the neuroprotective mechanism of BNG-1 might act as a PDE1 inhibitor
against cerebral ischemic and reperfusion injury.

This MRI study demonstrated that BNG-1 is effective at reducing the infarction
volume (T2 image in Fig. 1) and brain edema (ADC in Fig. 2) after ischemic
injury. The superior recovery of the T2 signal after ischemia in the BNG-1 group
compared with the saline group suggested an earlier resolution of vasogenic
edema [27, 28], which is typically caused by vascular regulatory dysfunction after
blood-brain barrier disruption. The lower ADC signal intensity in the BNG-1

group than the saline group also indicated an earlier resolution of cytotoxic edema
[27, 29], which is typically caused by cellular metabolic impairment after ischemia.
A delayed increase in the MR signal intensity occurred in both the CBF and
cerebral blood volume from Days 1 to 14 in the ipsilateral cortex after transient
MCA occlusion in rats [28]. A previous study revealed that postischemic
hyperperfusion was neither correlated to the final infarction nor did it affect the
outcome [30], whereas another study reported that postischemic hyperperfusion
was associated with an increased infarction volume [29]. Similar findings have
been reported and were attributed to increased angiogenesis [28] and vascular
regulatory dysfunction after ischemia [31]. Our study revealed that after ischemia,
the CBF increase on the lesion hemisphere was lower in the BNG-1 group than the
saline group, suggesting an improved postischemic hyperperfusion injury after
BNG-1 treatment.
MR SWI is a type of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent imaging, which is
correlated with the oxygen consumption of brain tissue [32]. Cerebral vessels
filled with deoxyhemoglobin typically present with low signal intensity.
Prominent cerebral vessel patterns in SWI can appear in cerebral ischemia,
reflecting increased deoxyhemoglobin in vessels. Therefore, the prominent vessel
pattern area in SWI is typically a surrogate of a misery perfusion area in acute
ischemic stroke. In patients with acute ischemic stroke, the prominent cerebral
vessel pattern in SWI is typically alleviated by reperfusion therapy [33]. The BNG1 group normalized the MIP of SWI signal intensity earlier than the saline group
did at 2 d after ischemia, suggesting an earlier normalization of deoxyhemoglobin
levels after BNG-1 treatment.
In the central nervous system, neurotrophic factors are associated with neurite
outgrowth and cell survival. The highest levels of NT-3, BDNF, and NGF are
observed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex [34]. PDE1 inhibition might
increase the phosphorylation of CREB, which increases the transcription of BDNF
[15]. Four of the 8 components of BNG-1 (Angelicae, Bupleuri, Ginseng, and
Astragali) effectively increased neurotrophic factors in a neurological disease
model [35–38]. In our study, the BDNF protein and NT-3 mRNA levels of the
BNG-1 group were significantly higher than those of the saline group at 7 d after
ischemia. It is possible that the neuroprotective mechanism of BNG-1 is partially
caused by its effect on recovering neurotrophin levels for neurogenesis after
ischemia.
The reason why there is effect only in the cortex but not in the striatum is likely
due to the protective effect mainly on neuronal cells and less on fiber tract.
Another possible explanation is the better collateral flow from leptomeningeal
arteries to cortex than striatum, which results in better survival of cortex tissue
than striatal one as well as better absorption of neuroprotective agents. Similar
pattern of cortex-dominant protective effect has been reported in some
neuroprotective agents such as minocycline and risperidone [39, 40].
Our study had limitations. The relatively heterogeneous results among the
animals might have affected the statistical power. Because BNG-1 is a mixed

compound with multiple effects on the physiology of stroke, it is difficult to focus
on a single therapeutic mechanism against ischemic injury.
In conclusion, this study indicated that BNG-1 treatment can improve cerebral
hemodynamics before the recovery of neurotrophin levels. The protective
mechanism of BNG-1 against ischemic injury might act by alleviating brain
edema, reducing postischemic hyperperfusion injury, normalizing deoxyhemoglobin levels, and recovering neurotrophin generation.
