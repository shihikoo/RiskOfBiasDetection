Aims: Ginsenoside-Rg1 (G-Rg1), a saponin that is a primary component of ginseng, is very useful and important
in traditional Chinese medicine for stroke. The objective of this study was to explore the mechanisms underlying
the neuroprotective effect of G-Rg1 on focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.
Main methods: Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurological examinations were performed by using Longa's 5-point scale. The brain infarct volume was determined by the 2,3,5triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) was evaluated by
Evans blue dye. Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR were used to assess protease-activated receptor-1
(PAR-1) expression.
Key ﬁndings: After G-Rg1 treatment, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in the neurobehavioral function score compared with normal saline (NS) treatment after ischemia/reperfusion (P b 0.05). G-Rg1 signiﬁcantly reduced the
infarct volume compared with NS treatment after ischemia/reperfusion (P b 0.001). The permeability of the BBB
was signiﬁcantly decreased in the G-Rg1 group compared with the NS group (P b 0.05 or P b 0.01). Western blot
and quantitative real time RT-PCR indicated that G-Rg1 administration down-regulated the expression of PAR-1
in the ischemic hemisphere compared with NS administration (P b 0.01 and P b 0.05, respectively). The level of
PAR-1 expression strongly correlated with BBB permeability in both the G-Rg1- and NS-treated rats (r = 0.856
and r = 0.908, respectively, P b 0.01).
Signiﬁcance: G-Rg1 may ameliorate the neurological injury, the brain infarct volume and the BBB permeability
induced by focal cerebral ischemia in rats and its neuroprotective mechanism is related to the down-regulation
of PAR-1 expression.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and negatively impacts social and economic development [4]. From 50 to 70% of
survivors of ischemic stroke experience severe disabilities [2]. Cerebral
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) causes substantial injury to the brain tissue
in cerebral infarction [23]. In addition, disruption of the blood–brain
barrier (BBB) causes additional serious brain damage during I/R injury
[5]. Severe damage to the BBB causes serious cerebral edema, which
can result in brain herniation or even death [8]. Therefore, it is critical
to identify an effective method to ameliorate BBB permeability after
I/R, thereby improving the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients.

In recent years, the hypothesized mechanisms of neuroprotective
agents have been examined, and the results have been positive and
promising in animal models of cerebral ischemia. However, these
agents have displayed only limited beneﬁt in clinical studies [19,29].
Among these agents, ginsenoside-Rg1 (G-Rg1), a saponin that is a component of ginseng, has been extensively reported to exert neurotrophic
and neuroprotective effects on the central nervous system [28] and to
play roles in protecting the heart [35]. Growing evidence indicates
that G-Rg1 exerts neuroprotective effects both in vivo and in vitro [14].
A variety of mechanisms underlying G-Rg1 activity has been identiﬁed,
including the activation of nerve growth factor, anti-oxidant, antiinﬂammatory, anti-apoptotic, and immune stimulatory activities, the
inhibition of excitotoxicity and excessive Ca2+ inﬂux into neurons, the
maintenance of the cellular adenosine triphosphate levels, and the
preservation of the structural integrity of neurons [7,11]. In addition, studies showed that ginsenoside may alleviate BBB damage and reduce brain
edema and the cerebral infarct volume [22]. However, the protective
effects of G-Rg1 on the BBB and its underlying mechanisms are unclear

with respect to cerebral I/R. Protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1, the prototypical isoform of the PAR family, is activated by thrombin [3]. PAR-1
mediates thrombin-induced cell death in a model of cerebral ischemia
[1]. Hirudin, an effective thrombin inhibitor, reduced ischemic damage
in models of ischemic stroke [25]. Furthermore, smaller lesions were
found in PAR-1-deﬁcient mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO) than in controls [10]. Therefore, PAR-1 may serve as a potential
pharmacological target for ischemic brain injury. Thus, the objective of
the present study was to investigate whether G-Rg1 protects against
BBB disruption and brain injury in a rat model of cerebral I/R. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying these neuroprotective effects were
explored by targeting PAR-1 expression.

Measurement of the brain infarct volume

Materials and methods

The rats were rapidly sacriﬁced under anesthesia via transcardial
perfusion of PBS 3 d after the operation. The rat brains were sliced
into 2.0-mm sections. The brain slices were incubated in a solution of
2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC, Sigma, Germany) for 30 min at
37 °C and then ﬁxed in 10% formalin solution. The infarct region
appeared in white color while the normal brain tissue appeared in
red. The images of the brain slices were quantiﬁed using an image
analysis system. To eliminate the inﬂuence of brain edema, the infarct
volume was calculated as the volume of the contralateral hemisphere
minus the non-infarcted volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere and
was presented as the percentage of the volume of the contralateral
hemisphere (%).

Animals and MCAO/reperfusion

Measurement of BBB permeability

Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–300 g) were purchased from
the Experimental Animal Center of China Medical University. The rats
were housed under controlled conditions: 12 h light/dark cycle, temperature 21 °C ± 2 °C, and humidity 60%–70%. The rats were provided with
free access to standard rodent food and water. Approval for the experimental protocol was obtained from the local ethical committee for
animal research. All animal experiments abided by the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals issued by the Institute of Laboratory
Animal Resources at the Commission on Life Sciences of the National
Research Council and published by National Academy Press. The utmost
possible efforts were made to diminish the suffering of the experimental
animals and the number of animals needed for this study. The rat model
of cerebral I/R, speciﬁcally MCAO/reperfusion, was induced as previously
described [15]. In our research group, we exhibit expert performance of
the MCAO model, and we have established this model of focal cerebral
ischemia based on our previous experience [6,24]. Reperfusion was initiated by withdrawing the suture after 120 min of ischemia. The rats were
anesthetized using 10% chloral hydrate (350 mg·kg−1). The shamoperated rats were subjected to the same procedure, except that the
middle cerebral arteries were not occluded after the incision of the neck.

BBB permeability was quantitatively assessed via the extravasation
of Evans blue (EB), which serves as a marker of albumin leakage. Brieﬂy,
EB (20% in saline, 4 mg/kg) was injected intravenously 90 min before
the given time point via the femoral vein. At the given time point after
operation, the rats were deeply anesthetized using 10% chloral hydrate
and were infused with heparinized saline through the heart ventricle
until the drainage ﬂuid from the atrium became colorless. Then, the
rats were sacriﬁced, and the hemispheres of the brain were separated
along the sagittal suture. Then, the ipsilateral hemispheres were
weighed and incubated in formamide (1 ml/100 mg) at 60 °C for 24 h.
The concentration of EB dye collected from each brain was measured
at 632 nm using spectrophotometry. The quantitative measurement of
the dye content was based on external standards dissolved in the
same solvent.

Time-dependence of G-Rg1 treatment
The rats were randomly assigned to the sham-operation (Sham),
normal saline (NS), or G-Rg1 group. Each group was further divided
into ﬁve subgroups after I/R according to the duration of reperfusion
as 6 h, 1 d, 3 d, 7 d and 14 d; 12 rats were included in each subgroup.
The G-Rg1 used in this study was of high purity (98%) as determined
by high performance liquid chromatography. G-Rg1 powder (1 g) was
dissolved in NS (100 ml) at the ﬁnal concentration of 10 mg/ml and
then stored at 4 °C. The rats in the G-Rg1 group received intraperitoneal
injections of G-Rg1 at a dose of 40 mg·kg−1·d−1. The rats in the NS and
sham groups received the same volume of NS. Intraperitoneal injections
of G-Rg1 or NS were performed twice daily (20 mg·kg−1 per time)
beginning at three days before the operation until sacriﬁcing the rats.
Neurobehavioral functional scoring
The neurobehavioral function score (NFS) of the rats was blindly
evaluated at 6 h, 1 d, 3 d, 7 d and 14 d after the operation. The NFS
was determined according to the previously published criteria [15]
with minor modiﬁcations. Paralysis was classiﬁed into 5 grades based
on the observation of different levels of paralysis in the rats. The rubric
was as follows: score 0, no neurological deﬁcit; score 1, failed to fully extend the contralateral forepaw; score 2, circled around while walking;
score 3, tumbled to its side while walking because of hemiplegia; and
score 4, lost consciousness or died. Only the rats receiving scores of
1 to 3 at 2 h after MCAO were included in this study.

Western blot analysis
At the speciﬁed time point, the rats were sacriﬁced immediately via
decapitation after an intracardial ﬂush with PBS. The corpus striatum
was isolated from the ischemic region of each experimental group. Samples containing 20 μg of protein were extracted. The protein samples
were separated using 10% sodium dodecyl polyacrylamide gels and
then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.
The membrane was incubated in a polyclonal rabbit anti-PAR-1 IgG
(diluted 1:1000; Abcam Biotechnology) or monoclonal rabbit anti-βactin antibody (diluted 1:1000; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology)
overnight at 4 °C. Then, the membrane was incubated in a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody
(diluted 1:5000 Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1–2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using chemiluminescence
(ECL kit; Pierce Biotechnology). The protein bands were imaged
using Image-Pro Plus 6.0 analysis software. The integrated density
values were calculated using a computerized image analysis system
(Alphaease FC) and normalized to those of β-actin.
Quantitative real-time PCR
At the given time point, the rats were sacriﬁced immediately via
decapitation after an intracardial ﬂush with PBS. The hippocampus
was isolated from the ischemic brain tissue of the rats, and total RNA
was extracted using TRIzol (Takara Biotechnology). We used the hippocampal brain tissue for the mRNA instead of the striatal tissue because
we attempted to diminish the suffering of the experimental animals
and the number of animals needed for this study. Labeled cDNA was
generated from the total RNA samples using the RevertAid First Strand
cDNA Synthesis kit (Fermentas). One-step quantitative real-time
RT-PCR was performed using a LightCycler thermal cycler system
(Roche Diagnostics). PCR was performed using the SYBR Green quantitative RT-PCR kit (Roche) and gene-speciﬁc primers for 40 cycles

C.-L. Xie et al. / Life Sciences 121 (2015) 145–151

according to the manufacturer's instructions. After ampliﬁcation, melting curve analysis and length veriﬁcation via gel electrophoresis were
performed to conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of the PCR products. As a negative
control, template RNA was replaced with PCR-grade water. Calculations
of the threshold cycle values and differences were analyzed using
LightCycler analysis software (Roche). Gene-speciﬁc primers were designed using LightCycler probe design software (Roche). The primers
used were as follows: PAR-1: forward, 5′-CTCAGCCTGTGCGGTCCT-3,
and reverse, 5′-AAGTAGACTGCCCTGCCCTC-3′, at a fragment length of
206 bp and a temperature of 58 °C; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 2 (GAPDH2): forward, 5′-GAGAGGGAAATCGTGCGTGAC-3′,
and reverse, 5′-CCATACCCAGGAAGGAAGGCT-3′, at a fragment length
of 196 bp and a temperature of 55 °C.

G-Rg1 decreased the permeability of the BBB after cerebral I/R
The permeability of the BBB was quantitatively evaluated by measuring of leakage of EB. In the NS group, the EB content was increased,
whereas no visible staining was found in the sham-operated group. As
showed in Fig. 3, the penetration of EB through the BBB began at 6 h
and peaked at 3 d after I/R. Then, the penetration of EB began to decrease but remained higher than that in the sham group. The EB content
in the NS and G-Rg1 groups were signiﬁcantly increased compared with
the sham-operated group (P b 0.05). G-Rg1 administration signiﬁcantly
reduced the BBB permeability compared to NS administration after 1 d,
3 d and 7 d of reperfusion (P b 0.05 or P b 0.01, Fig. 3).

Statistical analysis

G-Rg1 down-regulated the protein levels of PAR-1

All data were expressed as the means ± SD except for the NFSs,
which were expressed as the medians (ranges) and were analyzed
using the Kruskal–Wallis test followed by the Mann–Whitney U test
with Bonferroni correction. The infarct volume, PAR-1 protein and
mRNA expression levels and BBB permeability were analyzed via oneway ANOVA, and between-group differences were detected post hoc
using the Student–Newman–Keuls test. Differences between two
groups were statistically analyzed using the t-test. P b 0.05 was considered to be signiﬁcant. Correlation analysis was performed using SPSS
16.0 software.

Western blot analysis revealed a band at approximately 66 kDa corresponding to the PAR-1 protein in the rat striatum homogenates.
Quantitative analysis of the striatum ipsilateral to the lesion revealed increased protein expression of PAR-1 in the NS and G-Rg1 groups compared with the sham-operated group (P b 0.01, Fig. 4). The protein
expression of PAR-1 was decreased in the G-Rg1 group compared
with the NS group at 1 d, 3 d, 7 d and 14 d (P b 0.05 or P b 0.01), but
not 6 h (P N 0.05), after I/R (Fig. 4).

Results

Real-time PCR was performed using a LightCycler thermal cycler system. The mRNA expression of PAR-1 in the NS group was signiﬁcantly
higher than that in the sham-operated group at 6 h, 1 d, 3 d and 7 d
(P b 0.05, Fig. 5) but not 14 d. Additionally, the level of PAR-1 mRNA
in the G-Rg1 group was signiﬁcant higher than that in the sham group
at 1 d, 3 d, 7 d and 14 d (P b 0.05, Fig. 5) but not 6 h. The mRNA expression levels of PAR-1 in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the lesion were
signiﬁcantly decreased in the G-Rg1 group compared with the NS
group at each time point (P b 0.05, Fig. 5) except for 14 d after cerebral
I/R.

G-Rg1 reduced the NFS after cerebral I/R in rats
Cerebral infarction led to a deﬁcit of neurological function in the rats,
which was primarily detected as contralateral forelimb paralysis. The
NFS was evaluated using the scoring criteria of Zea-Longa. A higher
score on each test represents more severe dysfunction. In the present
study, the NFS at 6 h, 1 d, 3 d, 7 d, and 14 d after the onset of ischemia
was evaluated. No neurological deﬁcit was detected in the shamoperated group. In addition, we found more serious deterioration of
motor function in the NS group than in the G-Rg1 group at 1 d, 3 d,
7 d and 14 d, but not 6 h, after I/R (P b 0.05, Fig. 1).
G-Rg1 reduced the brain infarct volume after cerebral I/R
The infarct area was primarily localized to the striatum and a portion
of the frontoparietal lobe of the cortex in the left hemisphere. G-Rg1
administration signiﬁcantly reduced the infarct volume compared to
NS administration at 3 d after cerebral I/R (P b 0.01, Fig. 2).

G-Rg1 down-regulated the mRNA levels of PAR-1

Correlation analysis of PAR-1 expression and BBB permeability
Correlation analysis of the levels of PAR-1 expression and BBB permeability was performed using SPSS 16.0 software. The level of PAR-1
expression strongly correlated with the BBB Permeability in both the
G-Rg1 and NS groups. With increasing PAR-1 expression, the EB content
increased and neurologic function decreased (correlation coefﬁcient of
r = 0.856 and r = 0.908, respectively, P b 0.01, Fig. 6).

with the NS group at the corresponding time point (P b 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test followed by the Mann–Whitney U test).

Discussion
In the present study, our results demonstrated that treatment with
G-Rg1 reduced the NFS, the infarct volume and BBB permeability
induced by MCAO in rats and that its neuroprotective mechanism was
related to the down-regulation of PAR-1 expression. In addition, the
level of PAR-1 expression strongly correlated with BBB permeability in
both G-Rg1-treated and NS-treated rats. These results suggested
that G-Rg1 may serve as an effective neuroprotective agent for acute
ischemic stroke.
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used for thousands of years in China. To our knowledge, the ﬁrst written description

of stroke is in the oldest and most extensive classic literature of TCM,
Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon (475 BC–220 AD) [34]. TCM was the
primary effective method for the prevention and treatment of stroke before modern Western medicines were introduced in China, and ginseng
is among the most important herbs for stroke therapy in TCM [13].
Ginseng is a highly useful medicinal herb in China that has also attained
popularity in the Western world in recent decades [32]. However, it is
completely unknown which ingredients of ginseng are the active components for the treatment of cerebrovascular disease. To date, there
are approximately 40 ginsenoside compounds that have been identiﬁed, and the separation technique and analysis methods of ginsenosides
have been extensively reviewed [16]. Among these compounds, G-Rg1

is recognized as the primary compound that is responsible for the pharmaceutical effects of ginseng [21]. Recent studies have shown that GRg1 is effective for the treatment of hypoxic/ischemic brain injury via
a variety of mechanisms, such as the modulation of cell survival, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis [28]. Therefore, we speculated that G-Rg1
might play a key role in the treatment of ischemic disorders of the
cerebrovascular system.
Re-establishment of blood circulation after MCAO results in reperfusion injury, such as BBB leakage, brain edema and hemorrhagic transformation of the infarction [9]. The disruption of BBB integrity is among the
most important initiating factors of I/R injury to the brain. During cerebral ischemia, the disruption of BBB is an early and prominent event [20]
that induces the migration of inﬂammatory cells and large toxic molecules to the brain parenchyma [17]. The results of the present study
showed that G-Rg1 alleviated the neurological dysfunction and reduced
the BBB disruption caused by I/R injury.
A previous study showed that PAR-1 knock-out mice exhibited
reduced mortality and less brain edema formation, neuronal death
and neurological deﬁcits after global cerebral ischemia than wild-type
mice [30]. Other studies have shown that PAR-1 was up-regulated in a
rat model of focal cerebral ischemia [12]. In addition, in hippocampal
slice cultures, the PAR-1 level increased after oxygen-glucose deprivation [26]. Other studies have revealed that PAR-1 was associated with
brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia. For example, in a mouse
focal cerebral ischemia model, the brain infarct volume was signiﬁcantly
reduced in PAR-1 knockout mice and due to intracerebroventricular injection of a PAR-1 antagonist, BMS-200261 [10]. Recently, a large-scale
randomized controlled clinical trial enrolled 26,449 patients who

received vorapaxar to inhibit PAR-1 activity (2.5 mg·d−1), and the results showed a reduction of the risk of cardiovascular death or ischemic
events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic
stroke, or peripheral arterial disease [18]. These results indicated that
inhibition of PAR-1 reduces the risk of ischemic events in patients
with stable atherosclerosis, suggesting that PAR-1 plays a pivotal role
in ischemic injury both in vivo and in vitro.
Based on these previous studies, G-Rg1 exerts notable neurotrophic
and neuroprotective effects in hypoxic–ischemic insults both in vivo and
in vitro [33]. These studies revealed that G-Rg1 exerts a variety of effects.
For example, G-Rg1 induced the differentiation of mouse embryonic
stem cells into neurons in vitro via the GR–MEK–ERK1/2–PI3K–Akt signaling pathway [31] and increased neurogenesis after global ischemia in
the dentate gyrus of adult gerbils [27]. Based on our correlation analysis,
PAR-1 expression correlated with BBB damage following cerebral ischemic injury. Thus, the present study indicated that G-Rg1 attenuates BBB
permeability by inhibiting the expression of PAR-1.
Conclusion
We demonstrated that G-Rg1 alleviated neurological dysfunction
and reduced the BBB permeability in rats subjected to I/R injury. The
mechanisms by which G-Rg1 protects against focal cerebral ischemia
include, at least in part, the regulation of PAR-1 expression.
