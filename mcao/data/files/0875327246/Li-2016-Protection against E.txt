Ganglioside GM1, which is particularly abundant in the central nervous system (CNS), is
closely associated with the protection against several CNS disorders. However, controversial findings have been reported on the role of GM1 following ischemic stroke. In the present
study, using a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model, we investigated whether
GM1 can protect against ischemic brain injury and whether it targets the autophagy pathway. GM1 was delivered to Sprague-Dawley male rats at 3 doses (25 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg,
100 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection soon after reperfusion and then once daily for
2 days. The same volume of saline was given as a control. Tat–Beclin-1, a specific autophagy inducer, was administered by intraperitoneal injection at 24 and 48 hours post-MCAO.
Infarction volume, mortality and neurological function were assessed at 72 hours after
ischemic insult. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting were performed to determine
the expression of autophagy-related proteins P62, LC3 and Beclin-1 in the penumbra area.
No significant changes in mortality and physiological variables (heart rate, blood glucose
levels and arterial blood gases) were observed between the different groups. However,
MCAO resulted in enhanced conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II, P62 degradation, high levels
of Beclin-1, a large area infarction (26.3±3.6%) and serious neurobehavioral deficits. GM1
(50 mg/kg) treatment significantly reduced the autophagy activation, neurobehavioral dysfunctions, and infarction volume (from 26.3% to 19.5%) without causing significant adverse
side effects. However, this biological function could be abolished by Tat–Beclin-1. In conclusion: GM1 demonstrated safe and robust neuroprotective effects that are associated with
the inhibition of autophagy following experimental stroke.

Introduction
Ischemic stroke is a consequence of vascular occlusion. The result is irreversible neural tissue
injury, which is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. As the world’s population
continues to age, the incidence of stroke is expected to grow, increasing the interest and need
for novel approaches focused on improving the recovery and quality of life of stroke patients.
A key complication of ischemic stroke is neuron damage secondary to excitotoxicity, acute
energy failure, or programmed cell death under ischemia/reperfusion conditions [1, 2].
Increasing evidence demonstrates that prolonged autophagy, a non-apoptotic route of type II
programmed cell death, plays a role in cerebral ischemic injury amongst a variety of other neurologic conditions [3–5]. Autophagy is a programmed cell survival process that generally mediates breakdown and recycling of cellular components such as long-lived proteins and damaged
organelles. However, persistent stress can promote high levels of autophagy resulting in cell
death [6–8].
Massive activation of neuronal autophagy and its associated markers, LC3 and Beclin-1,
have been firmly established in a variety of focal ischemic stroke models [5, 9]. Another notable
factor includes the gangliosides. While GM2 and GM3 are induced transiently within the ipsilateral hemisphere after the induction of ischemic injury in the mouse [10], GM1, an important
component of lipid rafts, can act as a neurotrophic factor [11–14]. GM1 has been shown to
potentiate the action of neurotrophins and display a wide variety of central nervous system
functions including promoting survival, differentiation[15], neurodegeneration [14, 16, 17],
axon stability, and regeneration[18]. A plethora of studies have suggested that GM1 may be
involved in the stroke process, specifically the orchestration of cell death and subsequent neurological dysfunctions [19]. However, the precise mechanism of action remains inconclusive.
In the present study, the role of GM1 in ischemic stroke and its potential regulation of neuronal autophagic activities were investigated. We hypothesized that GM1 could improve neurological outcomes via the inhibition of excessive autophagy in stroke development. Tat–
Beclin-1 peptide was used to induce autophagy, and the effects of GM1 on infarction volume,
mortality rate and neurological deficits were assessed. Additionally, the expression of P62, LC3,
and Beclin-1 were measured as a potential mechanism of GM1 in conferring neuroprotective
properties following ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Materials and Methods
Animals and treatments
All experimental procedures using rats in this study strictly followed recommendations provided by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and were approved by the Bioethics Committee of Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.
Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 280~300 g were housed in a 12-hour light/dark cycle at a
controlled temperature and humidity with free access to food and water. All surgery was performed under chloral hydrate anesthesia, which was specifically reviewed and approved by the
ethics committee, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. During surgery, rats were
anesthetized with chloral hydrate (0.4 g/kg, i.p.), which was selected because, unlike alternative
anesthetics, it has not been shown to upregulate autophagy [20]. Then rats were subjected to
focal cerebral ischemia by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with a nylon
suture as previously described [21, 22]. After 2 hours of MCAO, the suture was withdrawn to
allow reperfusion. The heart rate, blood glucose levels, and blood gases were monitored before,
during, and after ischemia. Core body temperature was maintained at 37°C. Sham-operated

rats underwent a similar procedure with the exception of nylon suture occlusion and reperfusion. Ten rats that died during the operation under anesthesia were not included.
GM1 (purity>98%, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA, sc-202624A) was delivered at
3 doses (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg in 10 ml saline/kg) by intraperitoneal injection soon after reperfusion and then once daily for 2 days. The same volume of saline was administered as a control.
Tat–Beclin-1 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA, 506048#, 15 mg in 10 ml saline/kg, i.p.) was given
at 24 and 48 hours post-MCAO. Animals were randomly assigned to the following five groups:
sham surgery (n = 17), MCAO+saline (n = 27), MCAO+GM1 (n = 33 in the 50 mg/kg group,
n = 14 in the 25 mg/kg group and n = 14 in the 100 mg/kg group), MCAO+Tat–Beclin-1
(n = 14), and MCAO+Tat–Beclin-1+GM1 (n = 13).
Rats were monitoring hourly for the first 4 hours after the MCAO operation. The rats were
then observed twice daily for the next 2 days, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.
Endpoints used included heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature. Post-operative care consisted of monitoring heart rates, use of a heating pad to alleviate cold temperatures, oxygen
therapy for poor ventilation, closely monitoring the incision site for hemorrhage and infection,
and administration of pain killers in response to characteristic changes in behavior and/or dietary habits. Fifteen rats died post-operatively. The surviving rats were neurologically tested by a
masked investigator and euthanized 72 hours after MCAO. The brains were removed for the
preparation of slices or lysates.

TTC Staining
The infarct size of the ischemic cortex was measured as described previously [23]. In brief,
2-mm thick coronal sections were dissected using a rat brain slicer (Matrix, ASI Instruments,
Houston, TX, USA) 72 hours after MCAO. The slices were incubated in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C
for 30 minutes, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) at 4°C for 6 hours. Normal tissue stains red while infarcted tissue with absent mitochondrial enzyme activity fails
to stain and appears white. The infarct volume of each section was traced and measured by
manually outlining the margins of non-ischemic areas using an image analysis system (Imaging-Pro-Plus, Silver Spring, MD, USA). To account for the increase in brain volume secondary
to post-ischemic brain edema, infarct size was normalized to the contralateral cortex and
expressed as a percentage according to the following formula:
Infart Volume ¼

Left Hemisphere Volume  Right Nonischemic Volume
x 100
Left Hemisphere Volume

Mortality and Neurobehavioral Deﬁcits
Mortality was calculated at 72 hours after MCAO. Neurobehavioral deficits were assessed and
scored based on the scoring system of Garcia et al in a blinded fashion [24].

Immunofluorescence Staining
Animals were deeply anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused transcardially with saline
followed by 250ml cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB; pH 7.4).
Brains were dissected, post-fixed in PFA for 12~18 hours, and transferred to 30% sucrose in
0.1 M PB for at least 48 hours at 4°C. Serial sections of the entire brain were cut at 10μm thickness on a cryostat (Leica CM3050S). Double fluorescence labeling was performed as described
previously [25]. In brief, sections were rinsed 3 times in 0.01M PBS for 5 min each, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at 37°C, blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for

2 hours at room temperature, and incubated with the following primary antibodies: mouse
anti-Beclin-1, and rabbit anti-LC3-II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA, USA) at a concentration of 1:50~1:200 diluted in 0.01M PBS in a humidified chamber overnight at 4°C. Sections
were then washed with 0.01M PBS and incubated for 2 hours with the secondary antibodies
(anti-mouse IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor-488, and anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Alexa Fluor568, 1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) at room temperature. Tissue sections were washed 3 times in 0.01M PBS for 5 min each, and then incubated
with 2μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma Aldrich, Inc., St-Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min at room temperature to contain nuclei. Primary antibody incubation was omitted in some sections as a negative control. Images were acquired using an OLYMPUS BX51 microscope.

Western Blotting
Animals were sacrificed for tissue harvest at 72 hours after MCAO. Tissue from the brain cortex, including the penumbra area, were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at -80°C. Samples were homogenized in RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz) with protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and incubated on ice for 30min. Lysates were centrifuged at 14000 x
g for 25min at 4°C. Total protein concentrations were then measured using the Bradford assay
(Santa Cruz). Supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of 2x Laemmli buffer (Santa
Cruz) and denatured at 95°C for 5min. Protein samples (50 μg) were loaded on polyacrylamide
gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to 0.45μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The
membranes were then blocked with 5% milk (Sigma) in 1xTBST for 2 hours at room temperature, followed by incubation with the primary antibodies (mouse anti-P62, rabbit anti- LC3-II/
LC3-I or mouse anti-Beclin-1, Santa Cruz) at 1:1000 dilution in 3% milk overnight at 4°C. The
membranes were then washed 3x5min in 1xTBST and probed with the secondary antibodies
(goat anti-rabbit IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG, Santa Cruz, 1:8000) for 1 hour at room temperature. Immunoblots were then washed and probed with an ECL Plus chemiluminescence
reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) for 5min and detected by
exposure to Kodak X-ray film. The optical density of the bands was quantified by Image J software. β-Actin monoclonal antibody (goat anti-β-Actin, Santa Cruz, 1:5000) was also probed,
and used as a sample loading control for normalization, and the data were expressed as the
ratio to β-Actin.

Data Analysis
The analysis of the data was performed using SigmaPlot software. Data are expressed as the
mean ± standard error of the mean and analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls method. The neurobehavior scores were analyzed
with Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA followed by multiple comparison procedures by the
Dunn method. Data are expressed as the median ± 25th-75th percentiles. Statistical significance was defined as P< 0.05.

Results
GM1 Does Not Significantly Affect Mortality or Physiological Variables of
MCAO Rats
To investigate the potential for GM1 to protect against ischemic brain injury and whether this
protection involves the autophagy pathway, we employed a rat MCAO model. The experimental design and animal treatment are shown in Fig 1A. The study involved two parts: In Part 1,
the protective effects of GM1 were assessed for three different doses of GM1; and in Part 2, the

ability of Tat-Beclin-1 to attenuate the protective effects of 50 mg/kg GM1 was assessed. No
sham-operated animal died in the study (0/17 rats). There was mortality observed in all of the
MCAO groups, but the amount of mortality was not significantly different among the groups
(14.8% [4/27 rats] in the MCAO+saline group, 14.2% [2/14 rats] in the MCAO+25 mg/kg
GM1 group, 12.1% [4/33 rats] in the MCAO+50 mg/kg GM1 group, 14.2% [2/14 rats] in the
MCAO+100 mg/kg GM1 group, 14.2% [2/14 rats] in the MCAO+Tat–Beclin-1 group and
7.7% [1/13 rats] in the MCAO+Tat–Beclin-1+GM1 group [P>0.05]).
Additionally, no significant changes of physiological variables (heart rate, blood glucose levels, blood gases analysis [pH, pCO2, pO2, Na+, Ca2+, Cl-, BUN, Glu, Hct, HB, BE, tCO2, BB,

SBE, SBC, HCO3-, sO2], and body weight) were observed between the different groups
throughout the study (data not shown).

GM1 (50 mg/kg) Improves Neurobehavioral Functions and Reduces
Cerebral Infarction
To evaluate the sensorimotor deficits after MCAO, a modified Garcia test was performed at
72 hours following MCAO (Fig 1B). No deficits were observed in sham animals. In contrast, a
significant decline of neurological scores was detected in the MCAO +saline group (P<0.05 vs.
sham). After both the medium-dose (50 mg/kg) and high-dose (100 mg/kg) GM1 treatment,
there was a statistically significant improvement in neurobehavioral function when compared
to MCAO +saline group (P<0.05).
The cerebral infarction at 72 hours after MCAO was also evaluated using TTC staining.
Representative samples of TTC-stained brain sections with corresponding infarction volumes
are shown in Fig 1C. The infarction volume revealed a marked increase in the MCAO group
compared to the sham animals (26.3±3.6% vs. 0.2±0.2%, P<0.05). However, the infarct ratios
were decreased from 26.3% to 19.5% in rats with the medium-dose GM1 (50 mg/kg) treatment
(P<0.05 vs. MCAO). Although the brain infarction showed a trend toward reduction following
low-dose (25 mg/kg) and high-dose (100 mg/kg) administration, there was no statistical significance reached (25 mg/kg, 24.7±3.0%, 100 mg/kg 24.6±4.8% vs. MCAO 26.3±3.6%, P>0.05).
Overall, our results demonstrate that injection of GM1 (50 mg/kg) improves neurobehavioral
functions and reduces infarct volume after ischemic insult despite having no effect on the mortality rate in the MCAO model. Based on these findings, a dose of 50 mg/kg of GM1 was used
in subsequent studies.

GM1 Decreases LC3-II and Beclin-1 Levels and Increases P62 Levels
Following MCAO Injury
MAP1LC3B/LC3 and SQSTM1/p62 are most frequently used as markers to measure autophagy flux. LC3, the microtubule-associated protein light chain 3, exists in a cytosolic form
(LC3-I) and an autophagosome-associated membrane-bound form (LC3-II). The ratio of conversion from LC3-I to LC3-II is closely correlated with the extent of autophagosome formation
[26]. P62, a selective autophagy substrate, was originally discovered as a scaffold in signaling
pathways regulating cell growth and proliferation; however, it was also determined to bind to
several autophagy substrates, such as ubiquitinated proteins, damaged mitochondria and signaling molecules, promoting their autophagic clearance[27]. Beclin-1, another key factor in the
autophagic process, is essential for the recruitment of other autophagic proteins during the
expansion of the pre-autophagosomal membrane [28, 29]. To determine the effect of GM1 on
neuronal autophagic activities after MCAO, we first measured the LC3-II and Beclin-1 expression levels in brain tissue by immunostaining 72 hours after brain ischemia and quantified
both the LC3-II and the Beclin-1 positive cells in the penumbra area (Fig 2). The results demonstrate that continuous treatment with GM1 caused a significant reduction in the number of
both LC3-II positive cells (12.6±4.8 vs. MCAO 30±5.3, P<0.05; Fig 2C) and Beclin-1-positive
cells (10.4±2.9 vs. MCAO 24.8±4.8, P<0.05; Fig 2D).
To verify these findings, we performed Western Blotting analysis of LC3, Beclin-1 and P62
(Fig 3). MCAO promoted a significant increase in LC3-II and Beclin-1 levels (P<0.05 vs.
sham), which was obviously suppressed by subsequent GM1 injection (P<0.05 vs. MCAO),
though there was no significant difference in LC3-I levels between sham and MCAO or GM1
rats (Fig 3B and 3D). Conversely, the expression of P62 was significantly decreased following

MCAO and markedly increased with GM1 treatment compared to MCAO rats (P<0.05, Fig
3C). These findings confirm the role of GM1 in attenuating the effects of MCAO in rats.

Tat–Beclin-1 Enhances Autophagy Levels and Abolishes the
Neuroprotective Effects of GM1
To test whether autophagy is involved in the neuroprotective function of GM1, Tat–Beclin-1
was used to enhance autophagy post-MCAO. As expected, Beclin-1 levels were significantly
increased in the MCAO+Tat-Beclin-1 rats as compared to the MCAO rats. Furthermore,
Tat–Beclin-1 application resulted in an enhanced conversion of LC-1 into LC3-II and
enhanced P62 degradation, confirming its role as an autophagy enhancer. Conversely, the
administration of both Beclin-1 and GM1 led to a reduction in the levels of Beclin-1 expression,

LC3 conversion, and P62 degradation as compared to Tat-Beclin-1 alone, suggesting that GM1
can reverse the effects of Beclin-1 on autophagy (P<0.05, Fig 4A–4F). Tat-Beclin-1 did not
clearly increase the infarct volume nor worsen the neurobehavioral functions compared to
MCAO rats; however, the effects of GM1 on cerebral infarction reduction and neurobehavioral
improvement were abolished by Tat-Beclin-1(P<0.05, Fig 4A and 4B). These findings further
suggest that modulation of the levels of autophagy by GM1 contributes to its ability to attenuate the effects of MCAO.

Discussion
Nearly 15 million people worldwide suffer from stroke each year, and this number continues to
grow as a result of the aging population. The ensuing symptoms are a burden to the victims,

their families, and the surrounding community (WHO The Atlas of heart disease and stroke
section 15: Global burden of stroke). Despite the continued efforts to develop new pharmacological strategies, there are no effective treatment options as of yet. In the present study, to
explore the potential activity and mechanism of GM1 in providing protection against ischemic
brain injury, we investigated the effects of GM1 on MCAO-induced brain injury.
GM1 has been a focus of research investigations due to its function as a neurotrophic drug
and its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier [30]. Although the development of the acute
inflammatory polyneuropathy Guillain-Barre´ syndrome (GBS) following intravenous ganglioside treatment resulted in the withdrawal of GM1 from European market [31], this adverse
effect was shown to be rare, and the relationship between exogenous gangliosides and GBS
remains controversial [32, 33]. These drugs are still available and have been extensively prescribed in other markets including China, where a multitude of neurological maladies have
been treated with gangliosides in the absence of resultant GBS or other severe adverse events
[34–37]. In a trail conducted by Schneider et al., a 5-year clinical course confirmed the longterm safety of GM1 therapy and suggested favorable efficacy for Parkinson's disease patients
[35]. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of GM1in treating ischemic stroke has also been suggested in numerous clinical trials [38–40]. To understand mechanisms of GM1 that contributes
to its therapeutic potential, the present study sought to evaluate its effects in a stroke animal
model and its dose-dependent effects on neurological improvement. We did not observe any
statistically significant differences in mortality between groups. However, the medium dose
(50 mg/kg) GM1 treatment significantly improved neurological performance and alleviated
cerebral infarction, while the low dose (25 mg/kg) and high dose (100 mg/kg) treatments did
not. The precise mechanisms responsible for the neuroprotective effects of GM1 remain
uncertain, but, as demonstrated by our study, GM1 may act in part through the regulation of
neuronal autophagic activity. Autophagy (self-eating) is generally viewed as a cell survival
mechanism in response to various stress conditions, and occurs without typical hallmarks of
apoptosis. On the other hand, enhanced autophagy can also mediate cell death in cerebral
ischemia [41]. Brain neuronal death following neonatal hypoxia/ischemia injury is largely prevented by Atg7 deficiency, which is essential for autophagy [42], whereas, promotion of autophagy with rapamycin augments cell death in insulin-deficient mice in adult hippocampal
neural stem cells [43]. In support of a role for GM1 in regulating autophagy, Batten disease
(juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is associated with reduced autophagy, as well as
enhanced level of GM1 [44]. In the present study, we demonstrated that MCAO resulted in a
significant increase in LC3-II and Beclin-1 levels, which were markedly reduced by early initiation of GM1 (50 mg/kg) at 72 hours after reperfusion. Additionally, immunofluorescence
staining showed a dramatic increase in the number of LC3-II and Beclin-1 positive cells postMCAO, both of which were significantly reduced in the penumbra area after GM1 administration when compared with saline-treated rats. These findings suggest that autophagy might be
involved in the neuroprotective function of GM1.
To further test whether the neuroprotective effects of GM1 might be explained in part by its
ability to modulate autophagy, we tested whether Tat–Beclin-1, a specific cell-permeable
autophagy-inducing peptide, can attenuate the effects of GM1. Tat–Beclin-1 was recently identified by Shoji-Kawata and colleagues by domain mapping of the autophagy protein Beclin-1
[45]. It has been shown to efficiently induce autophagy in vivo and in vitro, decrease the small
polyglutamine expansion protein aggregates, and reduce mortality in chikungunya or West
Nile virus-infected mice by interacting with HIV-1 Nef [45, 46]. Consistent with these studies,
in the present study, injection with Tat–Beclin-1 resulted in enhanced conversion of LC3-1
into LC3-II and P62 degradation. Furthermore, GM1 mediated cerebral infarction reduction
was blocked by Tat–Beclin-1. Thus, these findings support the hypothesis that GM1 may exert

its neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke, in part, by regulating neuronal autophagic
activity.
Our results show that the neuroprotective effects of GM1 only can be observed within a narrow window of concentration, and that GM1 has no statistical neuroprotective ability when
both MCAO and Tat-Beclin-1 are applied, which is suggestive of a threshold of autophagy
above which neurotrophic activity cannot be observed within our model. Furthermore, it is
likely that other activities, in addition to autophagy, can contribute to the function of GM1.
The current study has the following limitations: 1) only one autophagy inducer was included
and no autophagy inhibitor was studied; 2) only short-term (3d post-stroke) effects were
observed, whereas longer term (14d, 21d post-stroke) effects were not studied; 3) while the
Garcia test was performed to assess neurobehavioral activity, tests for learning, memory, and
social interaction were not performed. For this reason, further experimentation, including
additional dosing experiments, specific autophagy inhibitor interventions, long-term studies
and additional behavior studies, will be critical for determining the potential of GM1 in clinical
ischemia. Nevertheless, the present results suggest that the early use of GM1 is safe and effective in rats after ischemic brain injury, and describe a new mechanism that could account for
the neuroprotective effects of GM1.
