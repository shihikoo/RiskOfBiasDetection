Abstract Investigations regarding hypertension and dietary sodium, both factors that influence stroke risk, have
previously been limited to using genetically disparate treatment and control groups, namely the stroke-prone, spontaneously hypertensive rat and Wistar-Kyoto rat. In this
investigation, we have characterized and compared cerebral
vasoactive system adaptations following stroke in genetically identical, salt-induced hypertensive, and normotensive
control mice. Briefly, ANP?/- (C57BJ/6 9 SV129 background) mice were fed chow containing either 0.8 % NaCl

(NS) or 8.0 % NaCl (HS) for 7 weeks. Transient cerebral
ischemia was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO). Infarct volumes were measured 24-h post-reperfusion and the mRNA expression of five major vasoactive
systems was characterized using qPCR. Along with previous
publications, our data validate a salt-induced hypertensive
state in ANP?/- mice fed HS chow as they displayed left
ventricular hypertrophy, increased systolic blood pressure,
and increased urinary sodium excretion. Following MCAO,
mice fed HS exhibited larger infarct volumes than their
dietary counterparts. In addition, significant up-regulation in
Et-1 and Nos3 mRNA expression in response to salt and
stroke suggests implications with increased cerebral damage
in this group. In conclusion, our data demonstrate increased
cerebral susceptibility to stroke in salt-induced hypertensive
mice. More importantly, however, we have characterized a
novel method of investigating hypertension and stroke with
the use of genetically identical treatment and control groups.
This is the first investigation in which genetic confounding
variables have been eliminated.

Background
Hypertension is the most important preventable risk factor
for premature death worldwide [1], increasing the risk of
developing coronary artery disease [2] and stroke [3].
Dietary salt intake is a known contributor to hypertensive
disease [4–6].
Approximately, one-third of patients with essential
hypertension are sensitive to dietary changes in salt [6].
Increased sodium has been linked to vessel remodeling [7],

123

40

increased left ventricular (LV) mass, increased blood pressure (BP) [5, 8], and increased urinary sodium excretion [1,
8]. Epidemiological studies have shown a positive correlation between salt intake and increased risk of stroke [6, 9, 10],
while others have demonstrated correlations between BP and
essential hypertension on stroke [3, 11–13]. No direct relationship between salt-induced hypertension and stroke injury
has previously been examined. Vasoactive systems, such as
the natriuretic peptide (NP), nitric oxide synthase (NOS),
renin–angiotensin (RAS), and endothelin (ET) systems,
possess homeostatic roles in normal states to regulate BP. In
salt-induced hypertension these systems show adaptive
changes that may affect stroke injury.
Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is modulated by volume
status and is responsible for the homeostatic control of
sodium and water content in the body. Heterozygous ANP
gene-disrupted mice (ANP?/-) display normal cardiac mass
and BP under normal conditions. Due to the salt-sensitivity
of this genotype, ANP?/- mice display left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH) and increased BP when fed high salt
(HS) [14, 15]. In the current study, we have used the ANP?/mouse to investigate the effects of salt-induced hypertension
on stroke particularly with interest in cerebral adaptations in
the NP, NOS, RAS, ET, and the vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) vasoactive systems.

Methods
Animal model and genotyping
Experimental protocols pertaining to the use of mice in this
study were approved by the University Animal Care Committee (UACC) of Queen’s University in accordance with
the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Care
(CCAC). All mice were bred and cared for in the Animal
Care Facility at Queen’s University. Mice were housed in
cages (up to 4 animals per cage) at room temperature on a
12 h light/dark cycle. Heterozygous (ANP?/-) offspring
were obtained by crossing wild-type (ANP?/?, C57BJ/6)
females with homozygous ANP gene-disrupted (ANP-/-,
C57BJ/6 9 SV129 background) [14] males. Mice were
weaned at 3 weeks and ear, and tail tissue biopsies were
collected for genotyping. The genotype of each mouse was
determined using an AccuStartTMII mouse genotyping kit
(Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and previously published PCR methods [16].
Dietary treatment and non-invasive tail-cuff BP
measurements
Male ANP?/- mice were fed either normal-salt (NS; 0.8 %
NaCl) or high-salt chow (HS; 8.0 % NaCl, Lab Diet 5001Ò,

123

Mol Cell Biochem (2015) 399:39–47

Brentwood, MO, USA) for 7 weeks. A total of 22 NStreated and 23 HS-treated mice (between 13 and 15 weeks
of age) were used. Chow diets and tap water were provided
ad libitum. At the beginning of the fourth week of salt
treatment, a randomized subset of mice (NS; n = 4, HS;
n = 5) underwent a 3-week training period to acquire BP
measurements using a CODA non-invasive tail-cuff system
(Kent Scientific, Connecticut, USA) [17]. Following
training, systolic BP measurements were recorded and the
mean value from two separate days at the end of salt
treatment was calculated.
To ensure successful salt treatment, a separate randomized subset of mice was used for urine collection
(0.8 % NaCl, n = 4; 8.0 % NaCl, n = 4). Urine was collected from each mouse by metabolic cages over a morning, 4-h time period, and analyzed for urinary Na?
excretion. Urinary Na? concentration was measured using
a sodium specific electrode (Model #: K-27504-30, Cole
Palmer, Montreal, Canada).
Induction of transient cerebral ischemia
Transient cerebral ischemia was induced by temporary
occlusion of the proximal left middle cerebral artery
(MCA) using the intraluminal filament method previously
described by Longa et al. [18] and later modified by Barber
et al. [19]. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (3 %
initial, 1–1.5 % maintenance), in oxygen to air ratio of
20:80 %. Core body temperature was monitored and
maintained at 36.5 °C using a rectal probe with feedback to
a heated surgical stage. Transcranial measurements of
cerebral blood flow were obtained by laser Doppler flowmetry (Perimed, Periflux System 5010, North Royalton,
OH, USA). A reduction of 70 % or more in regional MCA
cerebral blood flow was considered adequate to induce
ischemia. Occlusion was maintained for 30 min after
which reperfusion was achieved. All mice recovered in a
cage warmed to 34 °C by a circulating water blanket for
24 h and received 2 mg/kg of bupivacaine subcutaneous
(SQ), 0.5 mL of 0.9 % saline SQ and 2 mg/kg of meloxicam SQ for analgesia immediately following surgery.
Sham mice were used as controls; all surgical procedures
were conducted with exception of MCA occlusion.
Vascular casting
Mice (n = 4) were transcardially perfused with 140 mmol/
L NaCl, 10 mmol/L KCl, and 5 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (pH 7.5). Batson’s #17 polymer
(Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) (2 mL) was
injected (retrograde) through the thoracic aorta and left to
polymerize for 24 h. The skull was isolated and the soft

Mol Cell Biochem (2015) 399:39–47

and bony tissue digested in 1 mol/L NaOH and 5 % Contrad 70 (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) detergent.
Tissue collection
Mice were anesthetized via an intraperitoneal (IP) injection
of euthanyl (100 mg/kg body weight) 24-h post-reperfusion.
One millimeter cerebral sections were obtained. The fourth
slice (Bregma ± 1 mm) was isolated and snap-frozen for
molecular analysis. All other slices were stained in 0.5 %
2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) diluted in 19
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Infarct volumes were
measured using ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).
To account for the overestimation of infarct size due to
cerebral swelling, infarct volume measurements were calculated according to Swanson et al. [20]. The heart was
excised and dissected into individual chambers. Organ tissue
weights were normalized to tibia length.
RNA isolation
Total RNA was isolated using a combination of Trizol (Tri
Reagent, Molecular Research Centre, Inc. Burlington, ON,
Canada) and a high pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Scientific Co., Laval, QC, Canada). All wash and elution steps
were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was measured using Nano-Drop 2000 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA).
Reverse transcription
Total RNA (1 lg) was reverse transcribed into cDNA
using a high capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
(LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA). Protocol was carried
out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples
were incubated for 1 h with oligo-dT18 and an additional
hour with random hexamers.
Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Oligonucleotide primers were designed using Primer
Design 2.0 software (Scientific & Educational Software,
Cary, NC, USA) from published mRNA sequences from
NIH GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank) (National
Center for Biotechnical Information, Bethesda, MD, USA)
(Table 1). Primer sets yielding a standard curve with efficiency within 1.7–2.0 were deemed adequate. Levels of
mRNA expression were measured using the standard curve
method for each gene with hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) as a reference gene. All
qPCR was performed using the LightCyclerÒ 480 system II
(Roche Scientific, Laval, QU, USA) and all samples were
run in triplicates.

41

Data and statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6.0
Software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
Organ tissue weights to tibia length ratios, systolic blood
pressure (SBP) measurements for NS and HS treatment
groups, and infarct volumes were compared by unpaired,
two-tailed Student’s t test and plotted as mean ± SD.
Target gene mRNA expressional data were compared by
two-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons and Tukey
post hoc test. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
P B 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Potential
outliers were determined for all statistical analyses using
Grubb’s test.

Results
ANP?/- mice exhibit salt-induced hypertension, LVH
and a complete circle of Willis
Body weight and cardiac mass to tibia length ratios are
presented in Table 2. Previously, we have demonstrated
that ANP?/- mice are salt sensitive [14, 15]. When fed
HS chow over a 7 week period, ANP?/- mice exhibited
significant LVH, a clear indicator for cardiac changes
associated with the development of hypertension. Tibia
lengths were used as a non-confounding variable to normalize all physical masses. As compared to ANP?/- mice
fed NS chow, those fed a HS diet, demonstrated a 12 %
increase in cardiac mass by the end of the dietary treatment period. Furthermore, consistent cerebrovascular
casting demonstrated a complete circle of Willis in all
mice with the presence of posterior communicating
arteries (PCommAs) in both right and left cerebral
hemispheres (Fig. 1).

Salt-induced hypertensive ANP?/- mice exhibit larger
infarct volumes
A subset of ANP?/- mice underwent non-invasive tailcuff BP measurements to ensure the development of
hypertension. As expected, a significant increase (22 %)
in SBP was shown in ANP?/- mice fed HS chow
(159.5 ± 4.5 mmHg) as compared to the NS
(130.8 ± 10.2 mmHg) group (Fig. 2a). Only SBP is being
reported as other investigators have demonstrated inaccuracies in measuring diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
using non-invasive tail-cuff methods [21]. In addition,
mice fed HS chow excrete more urinary Na? as compared
to those fed NS (Fig. 2b).

Following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO),
mice treated with 8.0 % NaCl exhibited an approximate
threefold increase in infarct size as compared to the
0.8 % NaCl group (P = 0.0002) (Figs. 2c, 3). Thus, the
development of salt-induced hypertension in ANP?/mice significantly impacted cerebral ischemic infarct
size.

Cerebral vasoactive gene expression in response to saltinduced hypertension and transient cerebral ischemia
The mRNA expression levels of various vasoactive system
genes were assessed by qPCR methods. Sham operated
mice were used as controls to better assess gene expression
differences in response to stroke and/or dietary treatment.

Natriuretic peptide (NP) system
Gene mRNA expression levels of C-type natriuretic peptide (Nppc) and its specific receptor, natriuretic peptide
receptor 2 (Npr2) demonstrated no significant differences
across dietary treatment or across surgical intervention
(refer to Fig. S-1 in the Supplemental Figures). All components of the NP system, including ANP (Nppa), B-type
natriuretic peptide (Nppb) and natriuretic peptide receptor
1 (Npr1) were assessed; however, expression levels of
these peptides and receptor were undetectable by qPCR
methods.
Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) system
Figure 4 summarizes the changes in mRNA expression of
neuronal nitric oxide synthase (Nos1) (Fig. 4a), endothelial-derived nitric oxide synthase (Nos3) (Fig. 4b) and
receptors soluble guanylyl cyclase alpha 1 (sGC1a1)
(Fig. 4c) and beta-1 (sGC1b1) (Fig. 4d). A general, nonsignificant trend toward increased expression in response to
HS was observed in both receptor genes as well as Nos1
with no influence from stroke. The expression of Nos3
significantly increased in stroked, HS-treated (HS-MCAO)
mice as compared to the NS, stroke (NS-MCAO), and HStreated sham (HS-Sham) groups. Nos3 levels appear to
change in response to the combined effect of HS treatment
and stroke.
Renin–angiotensin (RAS) system
The resultant mRNA expression of angiotensinogen (Agt),
angiotensin-converting enzyme (Ace), angiotensin II
receptor type 1a (Agtr1a), and angiotensin II receptor type
2 (Agtr2) did not show significant changes although some
trends were observed. Both Agt and Agtr1 target genes
demonstrated a pattern of decreased gene expression in
response to stroke in both dietary groups equally, thus
increased salt did not influence these genetic changes.

presence of posterior communicating arteries forming a complete

Agtr2 mRNA expression increased in response to high salt
alone. (refer to Fig. S-2 in the Supplemental Figures).
Endothelin (ET) system
Endothelin-1 (Et-1) mRNA levels demonstrated a trend
toward increased expression following stroke in normotensive mice (Fig. 5a). A significant increase in Et-1
expression was observed in the HS-MCAO group as
compared to all other treatment groups (Fig. 5a). This
pattern of expression suggests that the combined presence
of increased sodium, hypertension and stroke stimulates
this system, above all, to respond. Although, no significant
changes were observed, a similar trend of increased
endothelin receptor A (Et-A) mRNA expression was seen

Flk-2 (Fig. 6c) exhibited similar expression patterns. Both
receptors showed an increase in mRNA expression in the
HS-MCAO group; however, only the Flk-1 expression was
significantly increased. As a result, these data demonstrate
angiogenic responses to a combined salt-induced hypertensive and cerebral ischemic event.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) system
Vascular endothelial growth factor type A (VEGFA),
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (Flt-1), and
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (Flk-1) were
assessed by qPCR to determine whether cerebral ischemia
and/or hypertension stimulates this physiological response.

response to salt was seen. Receptors Flt-1 (Fig. 6b) and

in acute stroke. The genotype expressed by the ANP?/mouse allowed us to examine the effects of salt-sensitivity
without confounding from genetic influences. Experiments
using the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and
spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHR-SP) rat
developed by Okamoto et al. [22], often use the WistarKyoto (WKY) rat as the control group, a genetically disparate animal from SHR and SHR-SPs [23]. The genetic
factors by which these rats develop hypertension or
become more vulnerable to stroke is still poorly understood. This is also the case with Dahl salt-sensitive and
Dahl salt-resistant rat models [24, 25] for which the genetic
basis of salt-sensitivity has also not been elucidated. This is
the first study in which the influence of salt-induced
hypertension on stroke tissue injury has been examined
using treatment and control groups with well-defined and
identical genotypes. Through evaluation of urinary sodium
excretion, SBP and cardiac hypertrophy, we have validated
the establishment of salt-induced hypertension in the
ANP?/- mouse. This is in accordance with previously
published work [14, 15, 26].
Vascular casting in the ANP?/- mouse demonstrated an
intact circle of Willis without anastomotic variations, thus
allowing comparison of cerebral responses across treatment
groups following stroke. As a result, we can be confident
that the increased infarct size we have observed in the HS
group is due to mechanistic changes that have been influenced by the acquired salt-induced hypertensive state.
Cerebrovascular adaptations, resulting from increased
salt and high BP, could contribute to the large infarct
volumes experienced by hypertensive ANP?/- mice. The
NP and RAS systems did not show significant changes in
mRNA expression of the peptides or receptors investigated
implying that these systems are not responsible for cerebrovascular changes in this state. However, changes
involving NOS1, NOS3, ET-1, and VEGF were seen.
Nitric oxide (NO) production is known to play a pathophysiological role for various vascular diseases, in particular, those related to aberrant blood flow and
inflammatory response. Increases in NOS1 have been
implicated with larger infarct volumes due to its neurotoxic
effects, while increases in NOS3 play a neuroprotective
and angiogenic role [27, 28]. In response to the HS dietary
treatment, cerebral mRNA expression of NOS1 increased
in ANP?/- mice, suggesting that NOS1-associated neurotoxicity may be stimulated in the presence of high sodium.
Cerebral NOS3 expression increased markedly in response
to the combined presence of high sodium and stroke, perhaps reflecting an induced endogenous protective response.
The effect of NO on vascular smooth muscle cells is
calcium dependent. Binding of NO to sGC receptors catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cGMP causing further
alterations in calcium availability leading to vasodilation.

123

Gene mapping of sGC receptor isoforms has revealed a
connection between expression of these receptors, saltsensitivity, and BP [29]. Our molecular analysis demonstrates a similar role for the a-1 and b-1 sGC isoforms as
trending increased mRNA expression was seen in the
hypertensive animal.
The ET system is responsible for vasoconstriction of
blood vessels, in particular, small arterioles, and controlling myogenic tone of capillary beds. The plasma concentration of ET-1 is increased in acute stroke patients [30,
31] and salt-sensitive/hypertensive individuals [32]. In
addition, ET-1 has been shown to disrupt microcirculation
in the brain rendering the cerebrovasculature at risk for
damage [33]. Although not significant, increased Et-1
mRNA expression was seen in response to stroke. In
contrast, there was a significant rise in cerebral mRNA
expression of Et-1 in the HS-MCAO group alluding to a
potential role for Et-1 in contributing to the large infarct
volumes in this subset of mice. Future experimentation is
required to better understand the mechanism of these
alterations and the role of ET-1.
VEGF is involved in angiogenesis [34] and enhanced
vascular permeability [35–37]. Ischemic conditions induce
the production of VEGF to promote new vessel formation
[38], but it remains unclear if this is beneficial or detrimental to stroke injury. Increased Vegfa, Flt-1, and Flk-2 in
response to HS may reflect a propensity for increased
vascularization and possibly contribute to larger infarct
size. Further experimentation would be needed to clarify
this.

Conclusion
We have successfully examined potential influences of
salt-induced hypertension on stroke with genetically identical treatment and control groups using the ANP?/mouse. Our data indicate that a salt-induced state of
hypertension renders the brain more susceptible to tissue
damage following an ischemic event. We provide evidence
for the notion that the large infarct volumes observed are
due to alterations in vasoactive systems, in particular the
NOS, ET, and VEGF systems, which change the response
and activity of the cerebrovasculature. Further investigation is required to identify the mechanistic role the proposed vasoactive systems play with respect to salt-induced
hypertension and stroke.
