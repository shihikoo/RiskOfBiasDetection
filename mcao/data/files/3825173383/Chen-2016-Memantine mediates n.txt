Aims: Memantine is a low-moderate afﬁnity and uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, which is also a potential neuroprotectant in acute ischemic stroke for its particular action proﬁles. The present study was to reveal the mechanisms involved in the neuroprotection of memantine.
Main methods: We used a mouse model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia via middle cerebral artery occlusion
to verify our hypothesis. 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used to compare infarct size. The
amount of astrocytes and the somal volume of the microglia cell body were analyzed by immunohistochemistry
and stereological estimates. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expressions.
Key ﬁndings: Memantine prevented cerebral ischemia-induced brain infarct and neuronal injury, and reduced
oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced cortical neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, memantine reduced the amount
of the damaged astrocytes and over activated microglia after 24 h of ischemia. In the early phase of ischemia,
higher production of MMP-9 was observed, and thereby collagen IV was dramatically disrupted. Meanwhile,
the post-synaptic density protein 95(PSD-95) was also severely cleavaged. Memantine decreased MMP-9 secretion, prevented the degradation of collagen IV in mouse brain. PSD-95 cleavage was also inhibited by memantine.
Signiﬁcance: These results suggested that memantine exerted neuroprotection effects in acute ischemic brain
damage, partially via improving the functions of neurovascular unit. Taking all these ﬁndings together,
we consider that memantine might be a promising protective agent against ischemic stroke.

1. Introduction
Ischemic stroke is an acute cerebrovascular accident resulted from
the blockage or plug of an artery to the brain, which results in the interruption of blood ﬂow to the brain [20]. Due to the interruption of the
supply of glucose and oxygen, over-activation of glutamate receptors,
calcium overload, acidosis and oxidative stress, all of these progresses
rapidly induce neuron death in the infarct core [20,25]. Now the potential therapeutic strategy for the acute ischemic stroke is neuroprotection. Therapeutic interventions, including inhibiting cytotoxic edema,
excitotoxicity and production of free radical, have been demonstrated
to provide neuroprotection against ischemic stroke [18]. Various drugs
targeting at curtailing the early ischemic cascade have been demonstrated to exert neuroprotective effect in preclinical models. These include antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), Ca2+
channel blockers, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists, magnesium and free radical scavengers [2]. However, clinical trials about

these drugs failed to demonstrate therapeutic efﬁcacy in early cascade
event of ischemic stroke.
Memantine is a chemical derived from amantadine, which was used
in clinical practice to treat several neurological disorders including
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD),
Alzheimer's disease (AD), stroke, epilepsy, vascular dementia and so
on. Memantine can noncompetitively binds to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), and acts as a low-afﬁnity open-channel inhibitor. Because of the special pharmacological properties of memantine, we
considered that memantine is likely to exert favorable actions during ischemic stroke because it can block excessive NMDAR activation but not
affect its physiological activity. Therefore, memantine is a moderate
NMDAR antagonist and can reduce or prevent excitotoxic damage without undesired side effects, such as anesthesia, hallucination, catatonia
and agitation. Although memantine mainly focuses on NMDAR, but it
can also affect other targeting pathways as reported, for example it
can reduce action potential ﬁring in cultured neurons, block nicotine receptors and 5-HT3 receptors [5,10,19,28]. However, the mechanisms
about how memantine protect the brain against ischemia were still
largely unknown.
In the present study, we established permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO)-induced stroke mouse models to explore the
involved mechanisms of memantine-mediated neuroprotective roles

[26]. Our results revealed that memantine not only protected neuronal
damage induced by ischemia, but also improved glial functions and
prevented degradations of extracellular matrix.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Mouse model and experimental protocol
The study was approved by IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee) of Nanjing Medical University. Male adult (8- to 12week-old) C57 BL6 mice weighing between 26 and 35 g were used. By
intraperitoneal (ip) injection of chloral hydrate (150 mg/kg), the mice
were remained unconscious during the surgery. Continuous monitoring
of body temperature was conducted and controlled at 37 ± 1 °C during
the procedure. After which, permanent focal cerebral ischemia was induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery according to the protocol of Longa as described [21]. The mouse brains were removed at 24 h
after surgery. Memantine was injected intraperitoneally (ip) once at the
dose of 20 mg/kg, half an hour before middle cerebral artery occlusion
(MCAO).
2.2. Infarct area measurement
2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) can reﬂect the function of
mitochondria and has been shown to be a reliable marker of ischemic
volume after ischemia. So TTC (Jinggong) staining was used to measure
the infarct size in the ischemia-treated groups (24 h after ischemia; n =
8–10 per group). Using an image analysis system (Image-Pro Plus;
Media Cybernetics) to trace the infarct area of slices which were taken
at 1-mm intervals.

2.6. Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously [12].
First, sections were restored to room temperature and then washed in
PBS. Using 3% H2O2 in PBS to quench endogenous peroxidase for
immuno-peroxidase localization. After the quench, the sections were
soaked in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS to block the nonspeciﬁc binding sites for an hour, and then incubated overnight with different primary antibody (monoclonal mouse anti-Mac-1, 1:1000
Serotec; polyclonal rabbit anti-GFAP, 1:5000, Abcam; polyclonal rabbit
anti-collagen IV, 1:1000, Abcam) at 4 °C. The sections were brought to
room temperature and then rinsed with PBS. After that the sections
were incubated with corresponding secondary antibody for 1 h at
37 °C. Different from immunohistochemistry, for immunoﬂuorescence,
special secondary antibodies conjugated to FITC were used to detect
the primary antibody (mouse anti-PSD-95, Abcam, 1:800). It was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark.
2.7. Quantiﬁcation of immunostaining
An individual who was unaware of treatment conditions of each animal performed the data collection. After choosing a starting point randomly, each sixth section along the dorsoventral extent of the
hippocampus was chosen, each animal yield a mean of 8 sections for
analysis. Firstly, they demarcate the boundaries of the stereological
analysis with a low power magniﬁcation lens (6.3 ×, 0.16 NA). The
total number of GFAP-positive cells was calculated with the optical
disector following a semiautomated system and fractionator rules
(StereoInvestigator software, Microbrightﬁeld, VT, USA) [16,33].
The nucleator probe was used to measure the somal volume of the
microglia cell body in each ﬁfth counted microglial cell.

2.3. Determination of neurological symptoms
2.8. Primary cortical neurons cultures
The severity of neurological symptoms of the experimental animals
was graded on a scale of 0′–5′ in a blinded manner: 0-no neurological
deﬁcit; 1′-retracts left forepaw when lifted by the tail; 2′-circles to the
left; 3′-falls while walking; 4′-does not walk spontaneously; 5′-dead.
Neurological symptoms were evaluated 24 h after MCAO.
2.4. Evans blue staining
The integrity of Blood-Brain-Barrier (BBB) was studied with Evans
blue Staining. Brieﬂy, 2% Evans blue (4 ml/kg, in 0.9% normal saline)
was intravenously administered at 24 h post-MCAO and was allowed
to circulate for 20 min. Then mice were transcardially perfused with saline to remove the intravascular dye. After that, animals were sacriﬁced,
the entire brains were removed. The brain hemisphere was weighed
rapidly, then homogenized in 50% trichloroacetic acid, and then centrifuged (12,000 ×g for 20 min). The amount of Evans blue in the collected
supernatant was quantiﬁed at 620 nm by spectroﬂuorophotometry.

Cultured primary cortical neurons were prepared from the cortex of
C57BL6 mouse embryos (E14/15) as described previously but with
some modiﬁcations [8]. Firstly, we use trypsinization [0.02% EDTA and
0.25% (w/v) trypsin in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution] to disaggregate cells at 37 °C for 5–6 min, and then gently triturate
tissue in plating medium (h-DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine
serum(FBS) and 10% horse serum; Sijiqing). Afterward cells were diluted to a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 and plated on poly-L-lysine
(Sigma)-coated 24-well plates and 25-cm2 T-ﬂask. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. After cell adherence, we replaced
the stale medium by Neurobasal medium which containing 2% B-27
(Gibco-BRL) and 0.5 mM L-glutamine (Sigma) to replace and treated
the cells with 1 M cytosine arabinoside (Sigma) for one day to avoid
glial cell proliferation. Every 3.5 days, half of the medium was replaced
with fresh medium. After 7 days the neurons could be used.
2.9. Oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) and drug treatment

2.5. Brain ﬁxation
Using chloral hydrate (150 mg/kg, i.p) to euthanize the animals. Exposing the heart to make an incision in the right ventricle, and a hypodermic syringe was carefully placed in the deep of the ventricle to
perfuse with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then 20 ml of 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. After perfusion the whole brain was removed and then soaked in 4% PFA for 24 h at 4 °C. Immunohistochemistry evaluation and conventional Nissl staining were conducted with
sections of 40-μm. The total number of Nissl-positive cells was calculated with the optical disector following a semiautomated system and fractionator rules (StereoInvestigator software, Microbrightﬁeld, VT, USA)
[16,33].

We took advantage of a hypoxia chamber (Thermo) to perform a
procedure of OGD. At the 7th day in vitro, cortical neurons were subjected to an OGD as described previously [27]. Brieﬂy, before the experiment, the medium was replaced by OGD medium and treated with
10 μM memantine. After that, the cells were incubated in the hypoxia
chamber programmed at 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 37 °C for 30 min. After
OGD, cells were removed from the hypoxic chamber and incubated
under normal conditions for 24 h for later experiments. In the normal
conditions, neurons were switched to the normal feeding medium,
and memantine (10 μM) was again added during reoxygenation. Control cell cultures were incubated under normal conditions throughout
the procedure. We used medium as a vehicle.

2.10. Hoechst staining
Twenty-four hours after OGD and reperfusion treatment, to quantify
apoptotic neurons, we used 4% PFA to ﬁx neuronal monolayer and then
stained it with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). NikconOpitical TE2000-S
inverted ﬂuorescence microscope was used to observe the morphological features of apoptosis (fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and
cell shrinkage) [34]. At the least, 400 cells from 12 randomly chosen
ﬁelds each well were calculated, and every treatment was conducted
in duplicate.
2.11. MTT assay
MTT assay was used to determine neuronal viability. Brieﬂy, neurons
were switched to 0.5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) in DMEM for 3 h at 37 °C. Then 150 μl dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to dissolve the formazan product.
Twenty minutes later, the cell cultured plate was brought to an ELISA
plate reader (TECAN) to assess the density at 570 nm [36]. Using the
percentages of the value of normal cells to express cell survival rates.
2.12. Western blotting
We used KeyGEN Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit
(KeyGEN) for the protein extraction of Mouse hippocampus. All processes were conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Equal amounts of each protein (15 μg) was separated by 10% SDSPAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride membrane
(PVDF) using a Bio-Rad miniprotein-III wet transfer unit. After blockage
in 5% fat-free milk solution and wash, the membranes were incubated
with individual primary antibodies including anti-MMP-9 (1; 200,
Santa Cruz) and anti-PSD-95 (1:500; Abcam) overnight at 4 °C. The following day, after wash the membranes were incubated with corresponding secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase.
To control protein loading, anti β-actin antibody (1:15,000, Sigma,
USA) was used as reference. Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce), digitally scanned and analyzed (Omega 16IC,
Ultra-Lum, Claremont, CA).
According to the literature [4,11], the secretion of MMP-9 achieved
the ﬁrst peak in the 2-4th hour after surgery. To detect the level of
MMP-9 precisely, we chose a time point of 3 h after the pMACO to conduct the collection of the protein.
2.13. Statistical analysis
All values in the paper are given as mean ± S.E.M. When variances
were not homogeneous in groups, for ANOVA comparison rank transformation was used. Values of p b 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant by

two-way ANOVA (ischemia and genotype as factors of variation), and
then by one-way ANOVA to analyze the effects in each group.
3. Results
3.1. Memantine alleviates severity of MCAO-induced neuronal damage in
mice
After 24 h of permanent MCAO, triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC)
staining was used to analyze the infarct size. The infarct volume of mice
pretreated with memantine was reduced to 3.2 ± 0.7 mm3 compared
with that of the vehicle-treated mice (14.9 ± 4.5 mm3) (Fig. 1A). The reduction of infarct volume was associated with a neurological deﬁcit improvement in evaluation 24 h after MCAO. Ischemic mice showed
neurological deﬁcits such as retracting left forepaw, circling to the left
or/and falling when walking. Treated with memantine improved the
neurological symptoms (Fig. 1B).
Twenty-four hours after ischemia, several cells in the CA1 region of
wild-type mice exhibited the ischemic neuronal injury characterized
by cell shrinkage, nuclear pyknosis and increased extracellular space.
Pretreatment with memantine remarkably increased the neuronal survival rate in mouse CA1 regions (Fig. 1C).
3.2. Memantine attenuates OGD-induced neuronal damage in primary cultured cortical neurons
To verify the neuroprotective effects of memantine, primary cortical
neurons were prepared and treated with memantine in OGD model.
Hoechst 33342 staining was used to quantify apoptotic neurons. The results showed that OGD increased neuronal apoptosis ratio to 30.5% and
memantine decreased the cell apoptosis ratio to 12% (Fig. 2A, B). Simultaneously, MTT assay was used to measure neuronal viability. Results
revealed that cell viability was decreased to 70% induced by OGD. Treatment with memantine increased cell viability by 28% compared with
vehicle-treated neurons (Fig. 2C).
3.3. Memantine ameliorates PSD-95 cleavage in the early phase of ischemia
Since memantine is a low-afﬁnity uncompetitive NMDA receptor
open-channel blocker. Therefore, we characterized the stability of
PSD-95 during cerebral ischemia, a major post-synaptic protein
interacting with the NR2 subunits of NMDA receptor. Immunoﬂuorescence staining showed the disrupted arrangement of PSD-95 in ipsilateral hippocampus in the early phase of ischemia (Fig. 3A). Immunoblot
analysis showed that the levels of PSD-95 were signiﬁcantly decreased
after 3 h of ischemia (Fig. 3B). Memantine could alleviate the arrangement of PSD-95 and up-regulate the expressions of PSD-95 (Fig. 3).

3.4. Memantine inhibits glia response in the mouse hippocampus after 24 h
of ischemia
Twenty-four hours after ischemia, astrocytes performed overreactive changes surrounding CA1 damaged neurons with a feature of striking increased expression of GFAP and by increased
number of GFAP-positive processes. As shown in Fig. 4A and B,
the numbers of GFAP-positive cells were 21,774 ± 967/mm 3 ,
27,098 ± 1209/mm 3 and 23,469 + 725/mm 3 , respectively in
sham groups, vehicle-treated mice and memantine-treated mice.
These data demonstrated that memantine pretreatment showed
a signiﬁcant inhibition of astrocytic activation in the mouse
hippocampus.

Simultaneously, ischemia induced microglia to be over-activated
signiﬁcantly, characterized by dramatic changes which were shifted
from the so-called “resting” ramiﬁed state to the fully “activated” amoeboid morphology. Therefore, the somal volume of microglia was increased to 461 ± 43/mm3. Memantine pretreatment caused a
reduction in the somal volume by 21.5% (Fig. 4C, D).
3.5. Memantine reduces endothelial cells injury and rescues matrix degradation, and improves BBB integrity in early phase of ischemia
To address which process during ischemia was affected by
memantine treatment, we investigated the level of MMP-9 and the expression of collagen IV during acute phase of ischemic stroke.

Fig. 3. Memantine alleviated PSD-95 cleavage. Representative micrographs are shown of PSD-95 (A) and western blotting analysis of PSD-95 expression (B) in the ipsilateral hippocampus

Immunoblots showed that the levels of MMP-9 were signiﬁcantly upregulated 3 h after ischemia (Fig. 5A). Moreover, MMP-9 caused the disruption of the basement membrane protein, collagen IV (Fig. 5B).
Pretreatment with memantine suppressed the MMP-9 expression and
thereby inhibited the disruption of collagen IV in mouse brain. Moreover, we determined the change of the permeability of BBB reﬂected
by the content of Evans blue in brain. The results showed that ischemia
remarkably increased BBB permeability. Pretreatment with memantine
could improve BBB integrity.

4. Discussion
Herein we found that memantine prevented cerebral ischemia and
OGD induced neuronal damage. Further study showed that memantine
inhibited glial activation and PSD-95 cleavage, decreased MMP-9

secretion, and thereby prevented the degradation of collagen IV in
mouse brain.
It is well-known that, during ischemia, glutamate excitotoxicity is a
main cause of neuronal cell death [7]. Pre-synaptic terminals can release
glutamate which then activates post-synaptic glutamate receptors such
as N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDAR). Glutamate accumulation results in over-stimulation of NMDAR and then induces neuronal
death. Hence, mechanisms that alleviate over-stimulation of NMDAR
exert a beneﬁcial effect in neuronal protection [15]. By blocking
NMDA receptor channels, memantine inhibited glutamate-induced
excitotoxicity and thereby prevented neuron against ischemic brain
damage. Recently, Trotman et al. conﬁrmed that administered mice
with memantine at a low dose for 3 days signiﬁcantly reduced lesion
volume and improved behavioral outcomes [6,31]. In the present
study, memantine produced deﬁnite neuroprotection in cerebral ischemic injury and protected neuronal damage induced by OGD, which was

consistent with previous studies [3,13,22,24,31]. More than 30 years
ago, anti-excitoxicity agents were proposed as promising therapeutic
candidates for brain diseases. However, they failed to translate into
the clinic due to dose-dependent complications and side effects.
Memantine is distinct from other NMDAR antagonists as it possesses
fast on/off kinetics, and is able to inhibit the effects of excessive glutamate without interfering with the physiologic activation of NMDAR.
Memantine has been routinely used in AD for many years at the dosage
of 5–10 mg/day with few side effects. Meanwhile, there was a smallscale clinical study demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of
memantine in patients with mild to moderate ischemic stroke [14]. Except for the better tolerability of memantine in clinical application,
memantine can also prolong the therapeutic time window for stroke.
In preclinical studies, one published article elucidated that 2 h after
the onset of stroke, delivering with memantine could alleviate brain injury [5]. When combined with other drugs, memantine could improve
their safety or prolonged the narrow therapeutic time window [24,
32]. These data suggest that memantine might be a promising antiexcitoxicity drug used for brain diseases such as stroke and AD.
PSD-95, which functions as a scaffolding protein, has been reported
to couple the cell-survival pathways. The decreased expressions of PSD95 were speciﬁc and occurred prior to neuronal death [29]. The cleavage
of PSD-95 is associated with excessive activation of NMDA receptor.
Moreover, PSD-95 forms ternary protein complexes with NMDA receptors, and plays a role in limiting the reciprocal potentiation between
both receptors from being escalated. The loss of PSD-95 would result
in severe cognitive decline due to the loss of neurons and synaptic disruption. These studies suggest a neuroprotective role for PSD-95 [1,9,
23,30,35]. Therefore, memantine-induced up-regulations of PSD-95 expression might promote postsynaptic function and neuronal plasticity,
and thereby attenuate ischemia-induced damage in our work.
Accumulating data suggests that neuroinﬂammation plays a crucial
physiological role in the progress of brain injury after ischemic stroke
[17]. During the early phase of cerebral ischemia, microglia activation
initially induces cascade of inﬂammatory events. Further, overactivated astrocytes can also promote the release of proinﬂammatory
cytokines, which exacerbates brain injury. Our results showed that ischemia resulted in more astrocytes damage and dramatically activation
of microglia which ﬁnally caused the severe cerebral ischemic injury in
mice. Treatment with memantine could signiﬁcantly inhibit glial overactivation.
Excessive MMP activity generates a series of deleterious effects, including the disruption of brain blood barrier, cell death and inﬂammation [4]. We found that memantine decreased the expression of MMP9 and inhibited the degradation of collagen IV. Therefore, ameliorated
the expression of MMP-9 by memantine would also contribute to its ischemic cerebral neuroprotective effects.
5. Conclusion
Our results suggested that memantine exerts neuroprotective effects
in acute ischemic brain damage, partially via improving the functions of
neurovascular unit. Our results indicate that memantine might be a
promising clinically effective drug for stroke.
