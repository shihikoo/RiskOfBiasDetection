Abstract 
Inflammation is a key etiologic component in atherogenesis. Previously we demonstrated that adeno-associated
virus (AAV) 2/8 gene delivery of Netrin1 inhibited atherosclerosis in the low density lipoprotein receptor knockout
mice on high-cholesterol diet (LDLR-KO/HCD). One important finding from this study was that FOXP3 was strongly
up-regulated in these Netrin1-treated animals, as FOXP3 is an anti-inflammatory gene, being the master transcription
factor of regulatory T cells. These results suggested that the FOXP3 gene might potentially be used, itself, as an agent
to limit atherosclerosis. To test this hypothesis AAV2/8 (AAV)/hFOXP3 or AAV/Neo (control) gene therapy virus were
tail vein injected into the LDLR-KO/HCD animal model. It was found that hFOXP3 gene delivery was associated with
significantly lower HCD-induced atherogenesis, as measured by larger aortic lumen cross sectional area, thinner aortic
wall thickness, and lower aortic systolic blood velocity compared with Neo gene-HCD-treated controls. Moreover
these measurements taken from the hFOXP3/HCD-treated animals very closely matched those measurements taken
from the normal diet (ND) control animals. These data strongly suggest that AAV/hFOXP3 delivery gave a robust
anti-atherosclerosis therapeutic effect and further suggest that FOXP3 be examined more stringently as a therapeutic
gene for clinical use.
Background
Inflammation is now known to be a key regulatory process that is common denominator among several risk
factors for atherosclerosis, in addition to accompanying
and associated altered arterial biology [1, 2]. Furthermore, it appears that both the innate and adaptive arms
of the immune system may also be involved in this overall
inflammatory trend which is implicated in atherosclerosis [3–7]. We have carried out various therapeutic adenoassociated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy studies in an
animal model of atherosclerosis (low-density lipoprotein receptor-knockout mouse on high cholesterol diet,
LDLR-KO HCD), towards the specific goal of regulating
the arterial immune cell infiltrate status with immunosuppressive cytokines and leukocyte chemo-attractant/

repellant chemokine genes, and thereby inhibiting atherosclerosis [8–15].
We recently published a study that demonstrated
that AAV/Netrin1 systemic gene delivery was able to
inhibit atherosclerosis in LDLR-KO mice on HCD [13].
This was shown by high resolution ultrasound (HRUS)
measurements of aortic lumen cross-sectional area,
wall thickness, and systolic blood velocity. All of these
measurements indicated that the Netrin1 gene delivery resulted in significantly lower atherosclerosis. However, upon analysis of the expression of various genes
by Q-PCR we discovered that both Forkhead box P3’s
(FOXP3) and CD25 expression were strongly up-regulated in the AAV/Netrin1-treated animals [13]. Of course
both FOXP3 and CD25 are hallmark markers of regulatory T cells (Treg). However, the exact mechanism by
which FOXP3 and CD25 are up-regulated by Netrin1 in
aortas challenged with HCD remains to be determined.
Of these two genes, FOXP3, in particular, the master transcription factor of regulatory T cells (Treg), is

intriguing as a therapeutic gene as the Treg phenotype
is tied to FOXP3 expression, and Treg affect both innate
and adaptive immunity [3–7]. It is the induction of the
FOXP3 gene which results in giving an immune suppressive function to Treg precursor cells, and the removal of
expression of this same gene in mature Treg cells results
in loss of Treg lineage identity and a marked reduction
in immunosuppressive properties [16–19]. Here we
characterize the effect of AAV-based human (h)FOXP3
gene delivery, by systemic tail vein injection, to inhibit
atherosclerosis in the LDLR-KO/HCD animal model. In
this study we use the human (h)FOXP3 transgene rather
than the mouse (m)Foxp3 version as the hFOXP3 and
mFOXP3 proteins are 86% homologous, and the use of
the human version brings us potentially one step closer
to clinical trials.

Methods
Ethics statement

All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee of the Central Arkansas
Veterans Healthcare System, Research and Development,
at Little Rock. The project was funded by a Veterans
Administration Merit Review grant to PLH.
AAV vector construction and virus generation

We directly addressed the hypothesis that hFOXP3 gene
delivery can inhibit atherosclerosis by using AAV2/8
[AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (ITR) DNA combined
with the AAV serotype 8 capsid] gene delivery. The
human (h) FOXP3 cDNA was obtained from Open Biosystems and was ligated downstream from the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (CMVpr) within the
gutted AAV vector dl3-97 to generate AAV/hFOXP3. The
AAV/Neo vector has been described previously [8, 10–
14]. AAV2/8 virus (AAV2 DNA in AAV8 virion) was produced using pDG8 helper and titered by dot blot analysis
by standard methodologies [8, 10–14].
Animal treatments

LDLR-KO mice (B6;129S7-Ldlrtm1Her/J) were purchased
from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Three
groups of male mice, composed of ten animals each at
8 weeks old, were injected with AAV/Neo (positive control
group), or AAV/hFOXP3 virus at a titer of 1 × 1010 e.g./
ml via tail vein with 200 μL virus per mouse, two booster
injections were followed at an interval of 5–6  days. High
cholesterol diet (HCD) of 4% cholesterol and 10% cocoa
butter diet (Harlan Teklad, Madison, Wis, USA) was provided from the first day of injection and maintained for
the entire study period. Another group of mice fed with
a ND was used as a negative control group. The normal

background mouse chow was Harlan catalog #7012, and
the HCD was #7012, 4% cholesterol/10% cocoa butter, custom formulated by Harlan. All experimental procedures
conform to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Usage Committee of the Central Arkansas Veterans Health Care System at Little Rock.
Ultrasound imaging

Ultrasound imaging was carried out using a Vevo 770
High-Resolution Imaging system (Visualsonics, Toronto,
Canada) with a RMV 707B transducer having a center
frequency of 30  MHz. Animal preparation was done as
described earlier [20]. In brief, the mice were anesthetized using 1.5% isoflurane (Isothesia, Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, USA) with oxygen and laid supine out
on a thermostatically heated platform. Abdominal hair
was removed with a shaver and a chemical hair remover
(Church & Dwight Co, Inc., NJ, USA). A pre-warmed
transducing gel (Medline Industries, Inc., Mundelein,
USA) was spread over the skin as a coupling medium for
more accurate measurements. Two general levels of the
vessel were visualized: thoracic region—below the aortic
arches to the diaphragm and then the renal region—the
upper abdominal region to the iliac bifurcation. Image
acquisition was started on B-mode, where, a long axis
view was used to visualize the length of the aorta. Then
the scan head probe was turned 90° for a short-axis view
to visualize the cross-sectional area of the aorta. Individual frames and cine loops (300 frames) were acquired
at all levels of the aorta, and included both the long axis
and short axis view and recorded at distances of 1  mm
throughout the length of the aorta. Measurement of the
flow velocity, orientation of the abdominal aorta by ultrasound, was accomplished by tilting the platform and the
head of mouse down with the transducer probe towards
the feet and tail of the mouse. This positioning resulted
in the Doppler angle to be less than 60° for accurate
measurements of blood flow velocity in the pulse-wave
Doppler (PW) mode within abdominal aorta. Off-line
measurements and data analysis was performed using the
customized version of Vevo770 Analytical Software from
both the longitudinal and transverse images. The complete imaging for each mouse lasted for about 25–30 min.
Measurement of plasma cholesterol

Total plasma cholesterol of AAV/Neo and AAV/FOXP3
mice were measured by VetScan VS2 (Abaxis, Union
City, CA, USA) at the Veterans Animal Laboratory
(VAMU).
Atherosclerotic lesion analysis by direct visualization

Whole dissected aortas were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, inspected under a dissecting microscope and any

Cao et al. J Transl Med (2015) 13:235

small pieces of adventitial fat that remained attached
were removed very carefully without disturbing the
aorta itself and the internal lipid accumulations/plaque.
Unstained small animal aortas are normally translucent
but show lipid deposition as white areas [21, 22]. Aortas
were then photographed under natural light using a 10
megapixel digital camera (Nikon, Japan).
Observation of atherosclerosis by histology

Twenty weeks after first injection of virus and on HCD,
mice were killed by CO2 exposure. Entire aortas, including the aortic arches, thoracic and abdominal aortas, were removed. The aorta was flushed with saline
solution and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
(Sigma). After 24 h, the fixed tissue was used for paraffin embedding and sectioning for histological analysis.
Finally representative sections were hematoxylin and
eosin-stained.
Statistics

Parameters were analyzed with statistics software SPSS
16.0 by nonparametric ANOVA test. If differences were
detected between means, Newman–Keuls test was used
for multiple comparisons. Difference were considered as
significant if P < 0.05.

Results
AAV vectors and animal treatments

We directly addressed the hypothesis that hFOXP3 gene
delivery can inhibit atherosclerosis by using AAV2/8
[AAV2 inverted terminal repeats (ITR) DNA combined
with the AAV serotype 8 capsid] gene delivery. The
AAV2/8-hFOXP3 was delivered by tail vein injection and
the animals placed on HCD (4% cholesterol, 10% cocoa
butter). Another animal group received AAV2/8-Neo
virus delivered by tail vein injection and also placed on
HCD, which served as positive controls. Lastly, a group
of animals received only a ND and served as negative
controls. The animals were then analyzed by high resolution ultrasound and harvested at 20  weeks post-injection/post HCD initiation. Figure  1a shows the general
structure of the AAV vectors used Figure  1b shows the
overall structure of the experiments. We have previously
demonstrated specific delivery and expression of multiple transgenes into the aorta by AAV2/8 (AAV2 DNA
inside the AAV8 capsid), utilizing the CMVpr transcriptional promoter, delivered by tail vein injection, to give
expression levels 1.7-2.3% that of β-actin [10, 11]. Figure 2a shows that the blood cholesterol levels were high
in both groups on HCD compared to the ND control.
However, the AAV/hFOXP3-HCD and AAV/Neo-HCD
treated animal were statistically different, with the AAV/
hFOXP3-HCD group having a slightly lower cholesterol

level. In Figure 2b, animal weights were statistically similar in all groups.
Analysis of aortic structure

High resolution ultrasound (HRUS) was then used to
analyze the aortas of at least eight animals per group. Figure  3 shows that the cross-sectional area of the lumens
of the aortas was significantly larger (p  <  0.05) in the
hFOXP3/HCD-treated animals than the Neo/HCDtreated animals by HRUS. Moreover, the lumens of the
aortas in the hFOXP3/HCD-treated animals versus the
ND control animals (negative control) were statistically
the same (not significant, NS). This evidence of robust
efficacy was surprising to us as Netrin1 gene delivery,
while showing efficacy, did not give this higher level of
efficacy. Moreover, further HRUS analysis, as shown in
Figure 4, indicated that aortic wall thickness was significantly thinner (p  <  0.05) in the hFOXP3/HCD-treated
animals than the Neo/HCD-treated, positive control
animals. Additionally, the wall thickness of the aorta in
the hFOXP3/HCD-treated animals and the ND control
animals were statistically the same (not significant, NS).
Thus, this additional evidence of robust efficacy fully
supports the lumen area analysis. Figure  5 shows that
the systolic blood velocity (systolic pulse wave velocity)
in the aorta of the hFOXP3/HCD-treated animals was
significantly lower (p  <  0.05 than the Neo/HCD-treated

animals, again consistent with a lower level of atherosclerosis. In this additional measurement the wall thickness of the aorta in the hFOXP3/HCD-treated animals
and the ND control animals were statistically significant.
However, it can also be easily observed that the systolic
blood velocity of the hFOXP3/HCD-treated animals was
much closer (lower) to the ND animals than to the Neo/
HCD-treated animals. The correlation between low systolic blood velocity with thinner aortic wall thickness and
larger aortic lumens we observed here matches the correlations we have seen in our other anti-atherosclerosis
gene delivery studies in our studies of LDLR-KO mice
on 4% cholesterol, 10% cocoa butter HCD [8, 10–14].
This again indicated that the hFOXP3 gene delivery did
provide high level of efficacy against HCD-associated
atherosclerosis.

visual inspection. It has already been documented that
unstained small animal aortas show lipid deposition
as white areas [21, 22]. Figure  6a shows representative
unstained aortas from the indicated animal groups. It is
readily visible that the AAV/Neo-HCD-treated animals
have much more numerous areas of white in both the
aortic arch and in the descending aorta than either the
ND or AAV/hFOXP3-HCD-treated animals. As the aortic arch is particularly susceptible to atherosclerosis the
aortic arches in these same aortas were further image
enhanced using MS PowerPoint black-white 25% display
as shown in Figure 6b. Again, consistent with the HRUS
measurements, the AAV/hFOXP3-HCD-treated animal
showed much less atherosclerosis than the AAV/NeoHCD-treated animal, and was very similar to the ND
animal.
Histologic views of representative aortas

Finally, histologic sections were taken across the axis of
the aortas to give representative cross sectional views. In
Figure  7, representative hematoxylin and eosin-stained

for smooth muscle layer thickness, but no statistical significance was seen. However, within the AAV/Neo-HCD
animal group an increase in smooth muscle layer thickness of 61% (p < 0.05) was observed in regions associated
with plaque compared to the opposing non-atherosclerotic region of the same micrograph.

Discussion
Our earlier Netrin1 gene therapy study demonstrated
that FOXP3 and CD25 were strongly overexpressed in
aortas compared to controls [13], and that this overexpression was associated with significantly lower

atherosclerosis. From these results we developed the
hypothesis that the Treg phenotype, specifically induced
by AAV/FOXP3 gene delivery, would show an inhibition of atherogenesis in our LDLR-KO/HCD model. This
study has demonstrated that our hypothesis was correct
and that CMVpr-FOXP3-gene delivery by AAV2/8 vector results in a robust protection of aortas from developing atherosclerosis in the LDLR-KO/HCD model.
The protection afforded by the FOXP3-treated animals
on HCD was shown by the finding that multiple aortic

parameters were not statistically different from the ND
control group. These data suggest that the FOXP3 gene
gives a high level of efficacy against HCD-induced atherosclerosis in the well-established LDLR/KO-HCD animal
model. None of our other therapeutic gene therapy in
LDLR-KO/HCD mouse studies has given multiple aortic
parameters which were statistically the same as the ND
control group [8, 10–14]. This includes our “gold standard” IL10 gene, which has been utilized by at least three
groups for inhibiting atherosclerosis [12, 15, 23–27].

Cao et al. J Transl Med (2015) 13:235

Very likely the efficacious ability of FOXP3 lies in
its role as the master transcription factor for the Treg
development and phenotype. It is known that the loss
of FOXP3 expression (or mutation FOXP3) results in
increases in chronic autoimmunity [18]. The phenotype of FOXP3 knockouts gives the “scurfy” phenotype
in mice and in humans generates the X-linked autoimmunity–allergic dysregulation and immuno-dysregulation, X-linked syndromes [28, 29]. Tregs are also
critical for lowering excess inflammation and giving
tolerance to gut commensal microbes [30]. However, if
present in extreme excess, Tregs may allow for dysplastic and malignant cell growth and chronic infections
through the governance of limited anti-tumor surveillance or limited anti-pathogenic organism immune
responses [30–32].
As we age it is clear that inflammation increases and
becomes a major threat to health [33–35]. Thus, the use
of Tregs, the promotion of the Treg phenotype, is one
possible approach to broadly limit this increasing inflammation, in the aged population. The use of AAV-based
FOXP3 gene therapy, to promote the overall Treg phenotype, could be an effective therapeutic gene and agent
against inflammation and diseases of the elderly. It is very
important that the forced induction of the FOXP3 gene
results in giving an immune suppressive function to Treg
precursor cells, and that the removal of expression of this
same gene in mature Treg cells results in loss of Treg lineage identity and a marked reduction in immunosuppressive properties [16, 19].
One possible mechanism for the AAV/hFOXP3-HCD
animal group cholesterol levels being lower than the
AAV/Neo-HCD group is the likelihood that Foxp3 is
known to induce both transforming growth factor beta
1 (TGFβ1) and interleukin 10 (IL10). Both of these are
known to be associated with lower cholesterol levels and
both of TGFβ1 and IL10 are known to inhibit the development of atherosclerosis. Both inhibit macrophage trafficking into the arterial wall intima and thereby inhibit
macrophage accumulation and foam cell formation.
Additionally it has been reported by Klingenberg et  al
that Foxp3 expression is linked with lower cholesterol
levels, as we see here [36]. Thus, in summary, our data
on FOXP3 gene delivery, and, in addition, the general literature on FOXP3 suggests that it will likely be a robust
therapeutic gene for the treatment of atherosclerosis
